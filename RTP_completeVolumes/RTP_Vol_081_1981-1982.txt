By John Wells
The Executive Committee of

round of initial announcements
and appointments associated
with the beginning of a new
school year.

The body was officially sworn
in by Dean Lewis John in a brief
ceremony at the start of the
meeting. Instead of delivering
an innaugural address, E.C.
President Eric Myers got right
down to business by announcing
the dates of upcoming freshmen
and first year law elections.

Petitions for freshmen can-
didates seeking a class office, a
representative position on the
E.C. or University Council, or
first year law suudents desiring
a seat on the E.C. are due on
Oct. 12. Voting will take place

on. Oct. 19 and a run-off, if
necessary, will be held Oct. 22.

In other business, it was an-
nounced that:

— requests for student body
funds are due Sept. 23; budget
hearings are scheduled for
Sept. 29; a budget vote will be
held on Oct. 6 at 6:30 p.m., one
day after the regular E.C.
meeting.

— so far, financial outlays
have been limited to refresh-
ments procured for freshman

‘orientation. Beer, pretzels and

Coca-cola added up to approx-
imately $150.

Following regular business,
Myers invited discussion of
feedback E.C. members might
have gotten from freshmen fol-
lowing orientation, which he
characterized as a successful
event. Most of the discussion
centered on the honor system
and what was described as
reported ‘ambiguous phras-
ing” contained in it.

Junior Representative John
Vhliahoplus remarked that
many freshmen were troubled
by the “easily recognizable’
clause of the code which refers
to students who commit an in-
fraction outside of the W&L
community. Myers said that
while the words are vague, they
are highly preferable to those
used prior to last year’s revi-
sions.

Other E.C. members said
freshmen were concerned that
not reporting an honor offense
was a violation itself. Soph-
omore Representative Ben Hale
shared Myers’ opinion on the
subject, saying that turning ina
student is ‘‘a duty, but not a
bonded duty. A student owes it
to himself, his classmates and
to the school to report a vioia-
tion, but he is not bound to do
so.” Myers made it clear that
failure to report an infraction is
not in itself an honor violation.

Kresge Foundation
Donates $250,000

The Kresge Foundation of
Troy, Mich, has made a
$250,000 challenge grant to
Washington & Lee University in
support of renovation projects
for two university buildings,
Tucker Hall and Newcomb
Hall.

To meet terms of the grant,
Washington & Lee must raise
the remaining cost of the reno-
vation projects, estimated at a
total of $1.5 million. Not coun-
ting the Kresge grant, W&L has
raised $750,000 toward that cost
to date.

 

Newcomb was in full use
when classes began at W&L
Monday (Sept. 14). Offices for
22 faculty members in history,
sociology, philosophy, and
religion have been provided as
well as several.classrooms and
seminar rooms.

The Tucker Hall project is a
renovation of the university’s
former law school building. The
renovated areas accommodate
the university’s computer
center and psychology depart-
ment. The classrooms and lab-
oratories have videotape cap-

 

All monies must be raised
prior to December 15, 1981, for
W&L to qualify for the Kresge
grant.

Both renovation projects
were begun in 1980 on the two
buildings that are part of the
university’s front campus,
which was designated a Na-
tional Historic Landmark in
1972.

The project to remodel
Newcomb Hall — the 97-year-
old former commerce building
at the south end of the Colon-
nade — has resulted in substan-
tially improved facilities for
four undergraduate depart-
ments in The College, W&L’s
arts and sciences division.

There are also specially
designed areas for research
work involving animals. Offices
and classrooms have also been
provided for the university’s
language departments.

Both renovation projects are
part of Washington & Lee’s $62-
million development program,
which is to be successfully con-
cluded by the end of the year.

gram in 1977 after completing

ABC Laws
Endanger

Students

by Steve Perry

A new law passed by the
Virginia stage legislature re-
garding the sale and consump-
tion of alcoholic beverages may
have a profound effect on the
social lives of Washington & Lee
students.

Uver the summer, the state
legislature revised the Alcohol-
ic Beverage Control (ABC)
laws in an attempt to limit the
drinking rights among 18-year-
olds. In the past, 18-year-olds
could legally purchase beer at
both on-premise and off-pre-
mise locations. The new law
states that an 18-year-old may
buy beer only at on-premise
locations.

An on-premise location is one
that sells alcohol only to be con-
sumed in an establishment by
the ABC. One such example is
the W&L Cockpit. An off-pre-
mise location sells only carry-
out beverages.

When asked what the penalty
for underage drinking in Virgin-
ia was, ABC agent, E.R. Dris-
kill stated that “the maximum
fine is $1000 or 12 months in
jail.”

18-year-old students are not
the only ones who could be af-
fected by the new law, however.
Since the legal age for the con-
sumption of wine, grain and
hard liquor is 21 in this state,
those drinking illegally may
also be charged with the same
class-one misdemeanor.

Fraternities caught serving
liquor to underage people are
also guilty of the misdemeanor,
according to Driskill.

Entertainment
History One-Oh-None

by Todd Jones

Mel Brooks, the brilliant com-
edian who has written, directed,
produced, and acted in such
films as Young Frankenstein,
Silent Movie, Blazing Saddles,
and High Anxiety, has just of-
fered his latest effort, History of
the World, Part I. Unfortunate-
ly, History of the World will not
join the ranks of many of his
other films as being a truly
great movie. History of the
World is too disjointed, too slow-
moving, but mainly, not very
funny.

The film is in the form of a
series of sketches outlining
world history from the prehis-
toric ages to the French Revo-
lution. The first sequence shows
a prehistoric man, Sid Caesar,
discovering music, fire, art,
and women. It is somewhat dis-
appointing that one of the
world’s best comedians speaks
not one line, but rather, grunts
for the entire time he is in the
film.

The next major sequence
takes place in Rome during the
reign of Nero, who is played by
Dom DeLuise. DeLuise spends
~« his screen time grunting, belch-
ing, falling down, and pulling

large objects out of his rear end.
To me, this somehow just isn’t
funny. Madeline Kahn plays
Princess Nympho, and provides
most of the laughs for this sket-
ch, which features Shecky
Green, Charlie Callas, and Hen-
ny Youngman.

Another major sketch takes
place during the Spanish In-

WLUR ’81

WLUR-FM, Washington &
Lee University’s campus radio
station, will begin its 15th con-
secutive year of broadcasting
on Monday, Sept. 21.

Staffed by W&L students,
WLUR is a project of the
university's department of jour-
nalism and communications.
The station was founded in 1967
as a 10-watt, part-time opera-
tion, but it now boasts a 225-watt
stereo signal and a 19-hour
broadcast day during the
academic year.

WLUR has undergone signifi-
cant renovations over the sum-
mer. In addition to improving
the station’s physical ap-
pearance, WLUR’s broadcast-
ing capabilities have been

strates that when Brooks is fun-
ny, there is nothing funnier. On-
ly Brooks could turn one of the

enhanced by the purchase of
new production consoles and

The station, which includes
community volunteers on the
staff in addition to the W&L
students, will offer a music and
public affairs format similar to
the one that was introduced a
year ago, according to Robert
J. de Maria, WLUR station
manager and assistant profes-
sor of journalism.

In an effort to maintain the
Cockpit’s image as a leader in
live entertainment on campus,
the University Center Commit-
tee has planned ‘“Tuesday in the
Pit,’’ a series of performances
by outstanding local bands.

“Tuesdays in the Pit’? was
developed by UC Chairman Bob
Schmidt and SAB Co-Chairman
John Martin as a way to help
stretch out the UC’s budget. By
charging $1 for admission to
each of the Tuesday night per-
formances, Martin said the UC
can spend more than its $10,000
budget for entertaining.

“We're not saying that we’re
not going to have other bands,”
explained Martin. ‘‘Other
shows will still appear.”’

Martin also said the Cockpit
has undergone several changes

‘to accommodate bigger crowds,

including more seating. Over
the summer, the Cockpit was
given permission to allow pa-
trons to take alcoholic bev-
erages into the gameroom. The
Pit will also serve bar bottles.

Martin expressed hope that
the Tuesday night feature will
catch on with the student body,
thus lessening the controversy
over Wednesday night parties.
Martin noted that the Cockpit
will close at 12 midnight on
Tuesday nights.

During September, girls at-
tending Tuesday night perfor-
mances in the Pit will be able to
get beer for half-price.

Film Notes

Heavy Metal—Hailed by some as the animatedStar Wars , this
film is a disjunct series of trashy, spacy blackouts. Big on sex and
grinding heavy-metal rock. If you, too, are big on these, go to it. But
you won’t see me (lucky you). Starts Friday at the Lyric.

Arthur — Plot is non-existing in this 30’s-style comedy vehicle.
But who cares? Dudley Moore is a very, very rich drunk who’s been
raised to be funny by his valet (Sir John Gielgud). His family
wishes him to marry a rich, boring social climber, and will cut off
the cash if he balks. But Our Hero meets a shoplifting Italian girl
from Queens...and balks. Liza Mennelli, as The Girl, is way out of
her league, but Moore and Gielgud are certainly worth the money.
Opens Friday at the State.

Stripes — Bill Murray joins the Army to meet women. The Army

 

will never be the same. Occasionally amusing.

’ Sports

Generals Drop Opener

Optimism Necessary

by John Cleghorn

In the September issue of the
Sporting News Furman Bisher
wrote an article entitled ‘His
Heart is always with the Under-
dog.’’ Bisher’s point is that in
following sports his attention is
on that player or that team
which is often overshadowed.
His examples are the tailback
behind Herschel Walker,
Mohammed Ali’s opponents,
the Pat Dyes instead of the P.W.
Bryants. Unusually among the
ranks of Bisher’s underdogs he
lists ‘‘the linebacker from
Washington & Lee.”’

Although Bisher’s point ‘is
that of obscurity, he chose the
wrong year to pick on
Washington & Lee because
there are no underdog
linebackers, or tackles, or runn-
ing backs, for that matter. In
fact it will be difficult to find
any underdogs on the 1981

’ General roster because it is one

of the strongest and most ex-
perienced teams in recent W&L
history as well as being the
culmination of four previous
building years for head coach
Gary Fallon. As the Falcon puts
it: “the. aging process is now
complete.’

Undoubtedly many, students
saw Saturday’s game and are

ready to write off the Generals

‘for the remainder of the season.

But before you lose all faith

consider the factors’ involved.
Last season Gettysburg easily
defeated W&L 28-0 but this year
saw many differences other
than the score.

One of the unusual statistics
in last Saturday’s mafch was
the. use of 5 quarterbacks in one
half. Coach Gary Fallon is pos-
ed with. an unusual problem of
being very deep in quarter-
backs. Rich arene and

Jim Wenke are two senior
quarterbacks who have shared
the position for three years.
Both of these athletes have a lot
of experience and know the
General offense.

In contrast is the third
quarterback, number 5, Al
Paradise. A transfer from Har-
vard, Paradise has good size
and superior ability but lacks
the knowledge of the system.
Examining the offense Satur-
day one could not place the
blame so much on the quarter-
back shuffle as gaps in the of-
fensive line.

The right side of the line suf-
fered greatly from graduation
as the Generals lost starters
guard Jim Forte, tackle Chip
Nunnally, .and ‘center John
Hendler. On the brighter side
the Generals see the return of
tail back Chris Cavilline, a very
promising runner, and tight end
Mike Fogarty, who will provide
a threat bothas a receiver anda
runner.

On the other side of the ball
lies the Strength that kept the
Generals in the ballgame. With
the offense sputtering it was up
to the defense to keep th> score

. close. The General defense was .

the toughest in the ODAC
against the run last year and
returns in full strength. .

What one must remember is
that this was only the Generals’
debut. Gettysburg. returned 16
of 22 starters and, in coach

Fallon’s opinion, is animproved .

team over last year’s. So for
any fans who feel their faith

’ starting to waiver it is only fair
to keep the book open on the.
_ Generals and Head Coach Gary

Fallon and to support them in
their effort to bring respectable
football back ‘to Washington &
Lee.

by Dale Park

The Washington & Lee varsi-
ty football team opened up its
1981-82 season last Saturday
with a disappointing 20-7 loss to
Gettysburg’ College on Wilson
Field.

The Bullets, a team which

_crushed the Generals 28-0 last

season, proved overpowering to
W&L once again. Gettysburg

struck early in the first period, |

turning a pass interception off
senior quarterback Jim Wenke’
into a touchdown drive. W&L
responded in the third quarter
as senior quarterback Rich
Hachenburg (one of five
quarterbacks coach Gary
Fallon would use in the first
half) hit senior tight-end Mike
Fogarty on a nineteen yard
scoring toss.

Fogarty’s touchdown proved

to be the only W&L score of the -

day. Several minutes later Get-
tysburg quarterback Brett Gipe
scrambled in from six yards,
capping an eleven play, 62 yard
scoring drive which put the
Bullets ahead to stay 14-7. Get-
tysburg scored again in the
opening seconds of the fourth
quarter as Gipe hit ‘tight end
Pat Lubin with an eleven yard
TD pass (the point after at-
tempt missed. )

The Generals had the chance
to make the game close. The
Bullets fumbled three times in
the fourth quarter and three
times W&L came up empty as
the Gettysburg defense sealed
off the Generals’ running at-

tack.

‘“‘We were afraid to play the
passing type of catch-up foot-
ball,’ offered Fallon, now in his
fourth year as head coach,
“because often times you play
right into the other team’s
hands.”’-

Line play proved to be the key "
to the Generals’ problems, A
tough Bullet offensive line open-
ed the holes that allowed
Gettysburg to gain 287 yards
rushing (to W&L’s 108), while a
young W&L offensive line was

‘dominated by an experienced

   

Bullet defense.

“We were aware of our lack
of line experience,” admitted
Fallon. ‘It was a concern we
had. Our veteran on the offen-
sive line (sophomore ’ guard)
Car] Peebles wasn’t even in the
game. This left us with inex-
perienced players in four of the
five line positions.”’

In explaining his decision to
use five quarterbacks in the
game, Fallon commented:
“I’m trying to feel my way out
of our quarterback problem. I
feel the best way to do this is to
look at all of our talent.”’

This Saturday the Generals
will take on their first ODAC
rivals of the season when they
travel to Emory, Virginia, to
face the Emory and Henry
Wasps. Game fime is 1:30 P. m.
on Fullerton Field.

Young Polo Team Opens Friday

by G. Bruce Potter

Coming off what Coach Page
Remillard called a ‘‘building
year,’”’ the Washington & Lee
water polo team will open its
season with the Revue Fall
Classic at Twombly Pool this
weekend.

The Generals compiled a
17-14 record last year, but the
team had alot of freshmen and

did not lose a single letterman:

to graduation. ‘‘Last year was a
building year. We dedicated it
to a lot of fundamentals and
educating the team in team
strategy and defenses — all the
little ingredients for the devel-
opment of a complete water
polo player.”’

By John Harrison
A wet playing field and a
preseason training program
that lasted just eleven days
were the biggest factors that
made most of yesterdays
season opener for the Wash-
. ington and Lee soccer team a
less than exciting 1-0 victory
over Mary Washing on College.
Mary Washington w is expected
to be one of the weal est oppone-
nent on the Gener: | schedule.

This was evident in ts inability —

~ to put pressure oi jthe W&L
defense for more th 1a minute
at a time; but the tain along
with the limited preseason pro-
gram, and a strong perfor-

mance by Mary Washington’s

goalie prevented the Generals
from running up the score.

was also named to the All-
America team for swimming,
making him only the second
athlete at W&L to make Ail-
America squads in two different
sports. Rock and Eric Peterson,
a junior transfer from Georgia
Southern, will captain this
year’s team.

Remillard is happy with the
progress the 17 team members
have made so far and feels that
this team will be “much
superior” than last year’s
group. ‘‘We’re a year older, and
we picked up in September
right where we left off last
November,” he said.

season at W&L.

“Our goal this year is to do

He also feels that the team

has a good chance of finishing in
the top four in the Eastern
championships. The top two fin-
ishers in that event will com-
pete for the national crown in
Long Beach, Ca.

Summing up this year’s
squad, Remillard said, ‘‘the

“unit will control our destiny.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Rush 1981

As if the freshman class did not have enough pro-
blems with cramped living quarters, now they have
been subject to one of the least efficient rush produc-
tions inrecent memory. A failure on the part of the In-
terfraternity Council to prepare this year’s freshmen
for the rush experience has left many a freshman
walking around houses like lost cattle.

The rush problem began when the IFC imposed a
‘‘no-contact”’ rule which, in effect, separated the
freshman class from a majority of the up-
perclassmen. Because of the no-contact rule,
freshmen and fraternity members are unknown quan-
tities tp each other. Without any chance to really look
at a house, the first few rush dates could become total
losses.

 

Second, the freshmen were never told how to set up ‘

their rush dates. We know of one instance where a
freshman picked his houses alphabetically. Another
freshman chose according to academic standing.
Such hit-and-miss tactics are not what rush is design-
ed for.

While academics must certainly be the first priority
at this university, the social life must not be neglected
either. It does not take a wise man to recognize that
fraternities are the social hub of this university.
Therefore it makes sense to inform our freshmen as
best we can about the fraternity system at W&L.

No-contact rules and the non-clarification of how to
rush are two examples of how the system can be

damaged.
The New Law

It’s a Saturday night and your house is sponsoring a
grain party and a band. Suddenly, you see a Lex-
ington Police Department squad car pull up in front.
The windows of the house are shut, so you figure a
noise violation is unlikely. Suddenly, the officer starts
asking for i.d.’s. Within minutes, he is taking the
president of the house and three other would-be par-
tiers down to headquarters.

The party is over.

As unlikely as all this sounds, it may indeed become
reality in the near future if the local agency of the
Alcoholic Beverage Control and the police depart-
ment decide to enforce the state’s new ABC law.
Under the new law, only 19-year-olds and up can drink
beer off premises. Grain and other brand liquors still
remain available only to people atleast 21 years of
age.

The threat of a liquor crackdown has always ex-
isted, but only now does it seem close to happening.
What makes all this such a threat is that ABC agents
or police officers may enter a fraternity and ask for
id.’s. If the fraternity is serving beer or liquor to peo-
ple underage, then the party can be legally shut down.
Moreover, the individual or the fraternity can face a
fine up to $1000 and a possible jail sentence.

Just when and if this crackdown takes place is
anyone’s guess. Most likely it would occur when
police begin checking for noise violations. Police will
also be looking for public drinkers, as some people
may have discovered last night.

The important thing to remeber is that ABC and the
police department are not seeking to force Lex-
ington’s fraternities into capitulation. ABC Agent
E.R. Driskill has even indicated that he does not want
to spend his time checking i.d.’s at houses. But if
drinking and public rowdiness get out of hand, then
the local authorities will have no choice but to enforce
the law.

| Comment: Don’t Rush Rush

by Todd Smith

Freshmen arrive and for one
week the campus is friendly and
charged with a sense of purpose
and expectation. They talk of
the honor code and classes, and
say hello to each other on the
colonnade.

Then the upperclassmen
arrive.

They don’t speak when they
pass. They talk of rack-dates
and easy B’s. Then comes Rush.
Upperminks divide underminks
into herds of prime, choice, and
sausage links. Houses fight over
the few; they dirty-rush and
backbite, and even friends part
when their paths cross over the
same freshman.

One dorm counselor laments
that noone really looks at these
freshmen with intentions to
shape them into men of honor
and intelligence. Their heads
are the malleable clay, joked
another counselor, that frater-
nities shape into funnels to pour
beer into.

Freshmen stumble around
IFC regulations to learn a sliver
of information about frater-
nities before they sign up for the
all-important first Rush Date.
Frats scramble for the big face-
men, gambling all on first im-
pressions. Freshmen ask
“what’s wrong with me?” when
they are not asked back.

Could we possibly find a
worse way to introduce a group
of people to Washington and
Lee? Freshminks who wake up
in the bathroom after their first
grain party must think not.
Frat-rats who work double
over-time to separate the wheat
from the chaff before the end of
the first week of classes must
think not.

Why not push Rush back to
late October of November?
Some schools delay Rush until
second semester; why not
W&L?

A candid answer from the
frats might be that we cannot
afford to prolong Rush a single
week. The intense process of
luring the elite of a class can
wreck GPA’s and ruin house

budgets.
There are other answers.
Freshmen, it is said, need a

place to party. They need so-

meone with whom to play I-M
football. They need transporta-
tion down the road.

But don’t we really mean that
we need the freshmen to party
with us, that we need them to
play football for us, and that we
need them to rely on us to get
around?

The effect of delayed Rush
would be to strengthen the unity
of the freshmen class. If the
freshmen cannot survive two
months without the slowed
social calendar that they will
nevertheless have to get used
to, let them turn to each other

for the solution.

Fraternity members have
noted the difficulty in avoiding
freshmen with “latent tenden-
cies” towards becoming obnox-
ious brothers, and of knowing
who they are missing in their
search for bid material. A de-
layed Rush would lessen the
reliance upon first impressions.

Above all, a delayed Rush
would rescue freshmen. They
have come to a small school on-
ly to be inflicted with our most
impersonal institution within
the first week.

As far away as Dartmouth
and as close as Charlottesville,
fraternities wait before rushing
their incoming students. We at
Washington and Lee should too.

Freshmen
to Receive

Drinking

Information

Entering freshmen at
Washington & Lee University
will receive information about
alcohol abuse as part of the
general freshman orientation
program for the first time this
fall.

According to H. Robert
Huntley, associate dean of
students at W&L, the informa-
tion will be disseminated by
way of the dormitory counsel-
ors, upperclassmen who super-
vise and provide guidance for
the first-year students.

“As part of the standard
training sessions we hold for
dormitory counselors in early
September, we will be including
one unit on alcoholism and em-
phasizing the role that the dor-
mitory counselors can play in
helping alert freshmen to possi-
ble problems,”’ Huntley said.

The training session for
counselors will be based upon
materials from BACCHUS
(Boost Alcohol Consciousness
Concerning the Health of
University Students), a
volunteer student organization
chartered on campuses to pro-
mote responsible alcohol-
related behavior.

The alcohol awareness por-
tion of freshman orientation is
in response to recommenda-
tions made last spring by the
university’s executive commit-
tee, the chief agency of student
government at W&L.

Citing its concern over the
growing’ ‘problem of alcohol
abuse among college students
throughout the nation, the ex-

‘History’
(continued from page 2)

provide one of the funniest
scenes ever on film.

The last scene takes place
during the French Revolution,
which is being led by Chloris
Leachman. Harvey Korman is

entertaining as a member of the
French elite. However, after
the tenth time that Brooks, as
Louis XVI, grabs a woman and
says “It’s good to be king,’’ one
wishes the sketch, as well as the
movie, would finish.

Brooks plays six different
roles himself, and comes out
looking more like a ham in his
first home movie than the com-
ic genius he is.

In short, History of the World.
Part I, features Mel Brooks and
almost all of his usual compa-
nions. However, unlike his pre-
vious films, this one fails to
entertain. It is possible that the
truly die-hard Mel Brooks fan
will come out of the theatre with
a positive impression, but I
doubt it.

Kresge Foundation Makes Donation

had attracted $21.5-million in
commitments as of July 30.
‘The generosity of the Kresge
Foundation will bring us a long
way toward completing the
fund-raising for these two im-
portant projects,’’ said
Washington & Lee president
Robert E.R. Huntley in announ-
cing the university’s receipt for
the challenge grant. ‘“‘We ac-
cept the challenge with both
gratitude and confidence.”’

The Kresge Foundation con-
sidered 1,551 qualified pro-
posals in 1981 and awarded new
grant commitments _ totaling
$33,354,000 to 176 charitable
organizations, including Wash-
ington & Lee.

The majority of those grants
were toward projects such as
Washington & Lee’s which in-
volved construction or renova-
tion of facilities. Most grant
recipients had, like W&L, rais-
ed initial funds toward their

respective projects before re-
questing assistance from the
Kresge Foundation.

The Kresge Foundation was
created solely by the personal
gifts of the late Sebastian S.
Kresge. Since 1924, appropria-
tions of over $416-million have
been made to institutions in the
areas of higher education,
health care and related ser-
vices, the arts and humanities,
social welfare, science, conser-
vation and religion.

That study, conducted by
members of a W&L class in
social science research me-
thods, was based upon a ques-
tionnaire answered by about
half the undergraduate student
body.

Among its findings, the
study concluded that students’
consumption of alcohol varies
considerably (from 7.6 percent
who said they do not drink at all
to 11 percent who said they con-
sume more than 25 drinks per
week) and that drinking is
“almost entirely a_ social
phenomenon, occurring at
group events” at W&L.

Williams warned that the

Wary that discussion would

the Symposium to a vote. The

Book Prices Rise

by Kenneth S. Nankin

Nearly every W&L student
was confronted with the neces-
sity of buying assigned text-
books last week and many ques-
tioned the cause behind the
seemingly overinflated prices.
According to bookstore man-
ager Betty Munger, the average
expenditure ranged from ‘‘80 to
100 dollars.”

While various theories have
been advanced as to the reasons
behind the high costs, Ms.
Munger defended the book-
store’s prices.

“We do not arbitrarily make
up a number,”’ she said. Rather,
she indicated the publishers,

‘for they ‘‘know they have a
captive market. The publisher
determines the base price.”’

Regarding the question of
faculty influence on textbook
prices, Ms. Munger replied that
“the faculty are extremely con-
scious of the costs.’’ She ruled
out accusations of faculty insen-
sivity to the average student’s
financial situation.

Still, there is some hope for
the student who wishes to
economize on textbook costs.
One way is to sell used tex-
tbooks back to the bookstore.
‘‘We buy back books at half the
price in May,” commented Ms.

Of the five applying for this
position, George Carey ’82 was

happily noted that the turn-out
for the student positions was
much better than last year.

After the interviews, Tripp

Brower suggested that the E.C.
table, “‘marred beyond belief,’’
be spruced up.

John Viahoplus moved to run

Abraham.

Freshmen ‘Adjusting Well’
to Crowded Dorm Conditions

by Bob Schlegel

Living in a freshman dor-
mitory is a difficult situation for
many first-year college stu-
dents throughout the country.
But at Washington & Lee, where
many single rooms have been
turned into double rooms this
year, dormitory life has become
even more of a problem.

Due to the renovation of
Graham-Lees Dormitory this
year, Washington & Lee’s
largest freshman dorm, all ex-
isting rooms on campus now ac-
commodate two. students, with
the exception of the counselors’
rooms, which are all singles. In
addition, three and one half
floors of the Robert E. Lee
Hotel serve as dorm rooms for
W&L freshmen.

Despite these tight living
quarters, which are most
noticeable in Gilliam. Dor-
mitory, the Class of ’85 seems to
be getting along well.

Dean of Freshmen H. Robert
Huntley stated, ‘“‘By and large,
the freshman class is adjusting
well.’’ Dean Huntley admits
that the rooms are tight, but he
also knows there is no way you
can get around the problem.
There are 370 freshmen in the
Class of ’85, and the university
is supplying 370 beds.

Dean Huntley also pointed out
that the university had the
choice of a two-year period of
renovation or a fifteen month
period. Fortunately, the shorter
period was chosen, which
means that Graham-Lees
should be completely renovated
by the end of August, 1982. ‘‘If it
(Graham-Lees) is not ready,’’
said the Dean, ‘‘there will be
heads rolling all over the
place.”’ Luckily for the owners
of those heads, the renovation
has proceeded on schedule so
far.

Dean Huntley realizes the
problems that can arise from
two people living in such close
quarters. In choosing room-
mates this year, the university
used the trusty computer,
which matched up students on
the basis of their likes and
dislikes, study habits, etc.

One of the results of the
crowded conditions in the
dorms will be a greater number
of students utilizing the library.
Dean Huntley commented, ‘I
think you'll see greater pres-
sure on the library as a study
facility than in the past.’ He is
pleased with this possibility.

He also emphasized the fact
that the Cockpit is open for
longer hours this year, to give

freshmen a place to go. Addi-
tionally, a student lounge is be-
ing organized in the basement
of the student center, and it will
be ready for use as soon as
possible.

Residents of Gilliam Dor-
mitory do, in fact, seem to be
adjusting well, as Dean Huntley
stated. The smallest rooms are
located toward the middle of the
building. These rooms are filled
with bunk beds, two dressers,
two desks, and two students. In

Mrs. Lewis Makes Donation

Washington & Lee University
has received a $250,000 gift from
Mrs. Dora L. Lewis of Rich-
mond, Va., to establish an en-
dowed honor scholarship pro-
gram at the university.

To be named the Dora L.
Lewis Scholarships, the pro-
gram will fund several scholar-
ships equal to the amount of
W&L’s tuition ($4800 in 1981-82)
each year.

The Lewis Scholarships will
be awarded to students who not
only possess outstanding re-
cords of academic achieve-
ment, but who also demonstrate
unusual promise for future ser-
vice and leadership.

The first four Lewis Scholars
were announced this month.
They are Jeffrey David Dixon
of Duncan, Ok., Scott Joseph
Henderson of Marysville, Ohio;
John Harold Moore of Colum-
bia, $.C.; and Peter Thornton
Wilbanks of Seaford, Del. All
are entering freshmen at W&L.
All will have their Lewis
Scholarships. renewed each
year they attend W&L, provided
they maintain satisfactory
records.

Mrs. Lewis, one of the univer-
sity’s staunchest supporters, is
president of New Standard Pub-
lishing Company, Inc., of Rich-
mond. She was for many years
secretary and treasurer of Best
Products Company, Inc., and
remains active in the manage-
ment of the company.

A native of Richmond, Mrs.
Lewis has been active in
numerous civic clubs in that ci-
ty. She is a member of the
Jewish Center of Richmond, the
Richmond Historical Society,
and the Virginia Society for the
Performing Arts. She is active
in the Temple Beth-E] Syn-
agogue. She has long been a
generous supporter of the Crip-
pled Children’s Hospital in
Richmond.

‘‘] thought I would like to help
any student who wanted an ed-
ucation' at Washington & Lee,
and this ‘seemed the most ap-
propriate way,’ Mrs. Lewis

 

said of her gift to the university.

Mrs. Lewis is the mother of
Sydney Lewis, a Washington &
Lee graduate and a member of
the’ university’s Buatd of
Trustees.

DOWN

THE ROAD:

You Owe
A Trip to

First in a series
Sweet Briar College
Amherst, Va

In starting off this year’s
series of local girls’ schools’
reviews, we figured that Sweet
Briar College would be the
logical place to start, since
Sweet Briar reviews generally
stir up the greatesi fuss.

A quick warning, freshmen.
Sweet Briar women hate to be
kidded about their school. You
can make jokes about pink-and-
green clothes or horseback
riding, but you’re digging your
own grave.

Witness last year’s letters to
the editor following the Phi’s
review of Sweet Briar. The
authors, who to this date re-
main anonymous, were called
everything from ‘‘a coward” to
‘“‘hegrudging’’ to ‘‘foot-in-
mouth.”’ Apparently, Hell hath
no fury like a Sweet Briar girl
scorned.

Anyway, here are a few
observations of Sweet Briar,
also known as ‘‘Sweetbush”’ or
“the Bush’’, which is located in
Amherst, a slightly-longer-than
an hour’s drive up, down and
around Rte. 60.

Sweet Briar has the prettiest
campus of all the surrounding
girl schools. Mountains arise
near the school, giving it a
scenario last seen in : ‘The
Sound of Music.’ The moun-
tains provide a natural escape
for all would-be hikers, climb-
ers, etc. It also gives
freshminks good cases of tossed
cookies their first few times
over.

Blown beets or not, all
freshminks owe it to themselves
to enjoy the Sweet Briar ex-
perience. What they will find is

Yourself
The Bush

a school that is (a) as closely
guarded as the king’s jewels
and (b) worried of fading into
obscurity.

Upon entering the college
grounds, your car will be stop:
ped by a guard standing in a
shack which, according to last

year’s Phi ‘‘looks like 2
photomat.”’ Security at the
Bush is rivaled only by

Randolph-Macon’s — and the
guards will indeed come a-
runnin’ at the appointed hour
Sweet Briar takes its securit:
seriously.

We'll refrain from makin;
references of Sweet Briar’s sex
uality. Every freshmamhears of
cold Sweet Briar beds at orien-
tation. Such judgment should be
left to the individual.

For entertainment, you can
choose from the Boathouse.
home of the annual ‘Bums’
dance, the Boxwood house, or
the various dorms. Be carefu
which group you come ir
though, for some fraternities
have run-ins with the Amherst
police over various _bottle-
throwing experiences.

The only problems you'll find
at Sweet Briar are the ones akin
to all the girls schools — smoke
filled rooms, warm brews and
some fashions that should be
taken with a grain of salt — o:
just plain grain.

For an overall rating, Sweet
Briar remains quite an enigma.
Times spent there range from
excellent to rotten. But con-
sidering the proximity of the
campus and the variety of fe-
males, you owe yourself a trip
to the Bush.

McThenia Drafts
Property Changes

Andrew W. McThenia Jr.,
professor of law at Washington
& Lee University, is one of the
principal architects of a new
proposal on unclaimed property
that the Uniform Law Commis-
sion will urge state legislatures
to adopt.

McThenia, a Virginia com-
missioner on uniform laws, was
one of the reporter-draftsmen of
the proposal adopted earlier
this month at the annual meet-
ing of the Uniform Law Com-
mission (ULC).

The ULC is a confederation of
state commissions on uniform
laws. The 250 practicing law-
yers, judges and law professors
who are ULC members are
selected by each of the 50 states,
the District of Columbia and
Puerto Rico. They draft and
urge adoption of legislative pro-
posals designed to solve pro-
blems common to all states.

The proposed Uniform Un-
claimed Property Act of 1981
which McThenia was instru-
mental in drafting deals with
property that has been lost or
abandoned by its rightful
owner. The property ranges
from stocks and bonds to utility
deposits to paramutuel tickets.

According to the UL, an
astonishing number of Amer-
icans deposit money in banks
and simply forget about it. Or
they buy stock and move
without bothering to leave the
company a forwarding address
for their dividend checks.

As a consequence, billions of
dollars lie abandoned in such
financial pockets. Often, the
rightful owner has died and the
heirs are unaware that a wind-
fall could be theirs.

The ULC committee of whioh
McThenia was a member draft-
ed a proposal designed to re-
unite owners with their proper-
ty and to streamline its transfer
to state custody.

In addition to McThenia, the
other reporter-draftsman of the
ULC proposal is David J. Eps-
tein, a practicing lawyer in Los

_Angeles.

McThenia, who received both
his undergraduate and law
degrees from Washington’ &
Lee, joined the law school facul-
ty in 1967.

dents do see something
suspicious happening on
campus, they should notify
campus security. Students
should call 463-9111 and ask for
ext. 198, or dial 463-9118 after

midnight.

The Lexington Police force
will also be patrolling the
streets. Police Chief James Kir-

cutbacks. He did stress that
students can reduce the number
of crimes themselves, especial-

‘Two men should be assigned to
scrutinize the party, and stay
sober in case a problem should
arise.” “This way,” Kirby add-

we have at least one man who
has a clear head that we can

been sold back for much less. If
a student does intend to sell
books back, warned Ms. Mun-
ger, he should avoid high-

might not be able to sell them

A final tip is to purchase a
used textbook as opposed to a
new one, for there is a signifi-

cant price difference between
the two. While new textbooks

. are generally in better condi-

tion, ‘‘used books will save you
money,’’ Ms. Munger said.

Although the actual cause of
high prices is of relatively little
comfort to the student who has
just completed his textbook pur-
chases, there exist ways that
can be utilized to save him
money when a new term begins.

Review:

Arthur! Arthur!

by Todd Jones
Arthur Bach is rich. Very
rich. Arthur is worth about $750
million. When asked how it feels
to have all that money, he re-
plies: ‘‘It feels great!”
“Great!” is an excellent ad-
jective for Arthur, surely one of
the best films released this
summer. Dudley Moore stars as
Arthur Bach, a rich playboy
who spends most of his time en-
joying life to its fullest, which
usually means getting drunk.
Arthur’s father, however, is
dissatisfied with the way his son
has turned out, and decides it is
time for him to settle down. He
arranges a marriage between
Arthur and the daughter of a
business partner of his. Arthur
does not want to marry the girl,
but changes his mind when his
father explains that, if he re-
fuses, he will be cut off from the
ihree-quarters of -a_ billion
dollars. While shopping for a
new wardrobe, Moore observes
a girl shoplifting. He chases her
into the street, and almost im-
mediately falls in love with her.
The woman is Liza Minnelli,
who portrays, as usual, an out-
of-work actress. Falling in love
with this girl creates a dilemma
for Arthur, who must now

choose between a life of wealth
with a woman he despises or a
life of poverty with the woman
he loves.

Arthur is billed as a com-
edy/love story. I would concur
with this idea, but I would argue
that the love story is not that
between Minelli and Moore, but
rather that between Moore and
his butler, played by Sir John
Gielgud. Throughout the film;
one feels the father-son rela-
tionship between Arthur and his
butler, Mr Hobson. It is less a
usual master-servant relation-
ship than a paternal one. In my
opinion, Gielgud is the best ac-
tor in the film. His portrayal of
Mr Hobson allows him to de-
liver the best lines in the movie.
His characterization was so fun-
ny, yet so real, that I think he
has put in the best performance
as a supporting actor in any
movie so far this season. His
scenes with Moore are without
doubt the best in the movie, and
among the best this year.

Dudley: Moore is onscreen
almost constantly. As Arthur
Bach, he is quite funny, al-
though some of his drunken
scenes are a little ove::done and
border on_ slapstick. Since

Richmond Sinfonia
in Lee Chapel

The Richmond: Sinfonia,
under the musical direction of
French conductor Jacques
Houtmann, will present the first
concert of the Washington &
Lee University Concert Guild
season on Monday, Sept. 28, at 8
p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Tickets for the concert are $3.
Members of the Washington &
Lee University community are
admitted free of charge.

Comprised of outstanding
musicians from conservatories
and orchestras across the coun-
try, the Sinfonia has been called
‘a tightly knit, well-disciplined
ensemble, flexible in technique
and musicianship, and respon-
sive to the interpretive aims of
its conductor’ according to the
Richmond News Leader.

The Sinfonia’s program will
consist of Handel’s ‘‘Concerto
Grosso in A-Minor, opus 6, no.
4’’: Mozart’s ‘‘Concerto No. 4 in
D-Major for Violin and Or-
chestra,”’ featuring violinist Ida
Kavafian; and, Beethoven’s
‘Symphony No. 2in D-Major.”’

Performing as an ensemble
since 1973, the Sinfonia is one of
less than 10 such groups in the
United States and has been hail-

ed as a bold new development in
the music world. This ensemble
forms the nucleus of the Rich-
mond Symphony, one of the
country’s leading regional or-
chestrasry 9 f;y

The Sinfonia. has presented
concerts in all geographical
areas of ¥ifZihia and performs
annually ‘for‘over 50,000 school
childrenjand thousands of addi-
tional Virginians at concerts
sponsored by colleges, music
clubs and other organizations
throughout the state. The Sin-
fonia’s repertoire encompasses
music from the 17th through the
20th centuries.

Houtmann, director and con-
ductor of both the Richmond
Symphony and the Sinfonia,
was born in Mirecourt, France,
and began his musical educa-
tion at the Nancy Consevatory
where he studied violin, horn
and harmony. He received his
concert license at the Ecole de
Musique in Paris as a pupil of
Jean Fournet and Henri Dutil-
leux and subsequently studied
symphonic’ and operatic con-
ducting under Franco Ferrara
at the Consevatory of Santa
Cecilia in Rome.

continued on p. 8

Moore plays the title role, the
success of the entire film is
dependent on his performance.
And the film is very enjoyable.

Filling out the cast is Ted
Ross as Arthur’s chauffeur, and
Geraldine Fitzgerald as Ar-
thur’s dirty-minded, — strong-
willed grandmother.

Much of the film, I think, is
based on the premise that the
audience would like to be in Ar-
thur’s shoes. At one point in the
film, Moore comments, “Don’t
you wish you were me? I know I
do.”’ This is an important idea.
The chance for the filmgoer to
fantasize about living, Arthur-
style, is one of the reasons the
movie gives the viewer such a

itive feeling. I know if I had
$750 million dollars, three Rolls-
Royces, and John Gielgud-as a
father-figure, and be able to en-
joy; life the way Mooredoes in
thig film, I would be Arthur...
without a moment’s hesitation.

Generals Show Their
Stuff In 24-17 Win

by Dale Park

A goal-line stand with six
minutes left to play allowed the
Washington & Lee varsity foot-
ball team to hold on to a 24-17
win over ODAC rival Emory &
Henry College last Saturday in
Emory, Virginia.

The victory evened the
Generals’ overall record at 1-1
and gave them a 1-0 ODAC
mark.

W&L’s junior tailback Chris
Cavalline got things rolling late
in the first period with a one-
yard touchdown run that gave
the Generals a 7-0 lead.

Only seventeen seconds later
E&H knotted the game at 7-7
with an 81-yard scoring pass
and then took the lead momen-
tarily in the second period on a
30-yard field goal conversion.

Al Paradise, playing almost the
entire game, quickly put the
Generals back on top. Paradise
scrambled in from five yards
for a score late in the second
quarter, later leading his team
in an early third quarter drive
capped off by a_ two-yard
Cavalline touchdown run.
Several minutes later junior
kicker Bill Devine added a 38-
yard field goal to his three suc-
cessful point-after conversions

‘and the Generals’ lead stretch-

ed to 24-10.

The Wasps drew within a
touchdown early in the fourth
period on a 25-yard scoring pass
and had a chance to tie and
possibly win the game late in
the period as a pass _ inter-
ference call gave E&H the ball
on the W&L one-foot line.

one dive play and one incom-
plete pass later E&H was still
not in the end zone. The
Generals took over deep in their
own territory and ran out the
clock with a drive which includ-
ed several crucial first downs.

On the afternoon, Paradise
completed eight of thirteen
passes for 109 yards while
Cavalline carried the ball 38
times for 156 yards and two
touchdowns.

“Al (Paradise) really came
through for us,” said Head
Coach Gary Fallon, “yet he still
needs time to gain a full grasp
of the offense.” Fallon admitted
that the quarterback situation
is still “up in the air’ as the
coach searches for a consistent
team leader.

Commenting on Cavalline’s

“work horse” role, Fallon of-
fered, “we don’t want,, to
overuse him (Cavalline). He’ sa

punishing type runner. ,j@nd
sometimes that can take its toll.

Commentary:

 

 

 

 

 

Junior Tailback Chris Cavalline carried the ball 38 times for 156
yards and two touchdowns.

He does so much punting and
pass receiving for us that we’ve
got to figure out a way to spell
him once in a while.”’

The Generals’ next big test
will come against Centre Col-

lege of Danville, Kentucky.
Last year W&L defeated the
Colonels, 16-9, in Danville.

Game time is 1:30 p.m. on
Wilson Field.

Violent Sunday Morning

by John Cleghorn

Sunday morning, while most
of the university community
was sleeping off Saturday
night’s party or looking over the
morning paper there were some
very strange goings on in
Turner gym. Down the hall one
could hear threatening yells
and screams that echoed in the
humid indoor pool. If curiosity
drove you into this | noisy
enclosure the scene there would
have appeared even more
strange. Twelve bodies in a pool
with colored shower caps, and
eye black were flailing their
arms in the air and thrashing
their legs in the water. Finally
they split up into groups. with
blue caps on one side of the pool
and white on the other. Both
ends had a big net and a man in

it who ‘would occasionally shoot

up, grab the top bar and hang
for a while. But this fascinating
behavior was quickly stopped
when two men in white walked
out on the sides of the pool.
These characters carried sticks
that had a white flag on one end
and a blue flag on the other. One
carried a bright yellow ball and
as he gave a shrill blast on his
whistle the guys in the water
grew silent and aimed them-
selves at each other across the

pool. One of the characters on
the side knelt down at about the
middle of the pool and blasted
his whistle. With this the
players shot off from the edge of
the pool swimming furiously
directly at each other. Just
about the time the two on the
edge of the pool hit head on, the
fellow in white dropped the ball
between them. Now it all
started to make a little sense.
This minor war was in fact

31 S. Main St.,

 

CRAFTS PLUS, INC,

GAMES, HOBBIES, & CRAFT SUPPLIES
Lexington 463-3355

the final game of the Water Polo
Review Fall Classic which pit-
ted W&L against, appropriately
enough, Slippery Rock. The
Generals fell 13-5 but for this
my first polo game it was a dan-
dy. I think it would be safe to
say that the majority of W&L
students have never seen water
polo, which is a real shame be-
cause this game offers it all. If
you're into violence it is certain-
ly satisfying. The one on one
defense, somewhat similar to
basketball or lacrosse, features
a constant battle for position
between two players whether
the ball is nearby or not. The of-
fensive strategy also resembles
lacrosse and in some ways
hockey as teams form a peri-
meter around the goal to set up
a shot.

By drawing similarities be-
tween polo and other sports I
certainly do not intend to say it
is the same. The aspect of con-
stantly being in and having to
do all this in the water sets this
game apart from any other. If
you’ve never seen water polo, I
recommend it highly as a com-
petitive and vigorous game, and
W&L, who competes with the
best teams in the nation, cer-
tainly offers high skill and
quality play.

  

  
Booters

by John Harrison

The Washington & Lee soccer
team recorded its second
shutout of the season when it
defeated an inexperienced
Maryville (Tenn.) team last
Saturday, 4-0. The victory gave
the Generals a 1-0 record in the
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference and an overall record of
2-0.

Sophomore forward Roland
Simon led the attack with two
goals and an assist. Simon and
Gary Clements, who contribut-
ed a goal and two assists,
shared  player-of-the-game
honors. Senior tri-captain Tad
Renner added the fourth goal.

The Generals are planning to
meet a much tougher opponent
when they take on Haverford
(Pa.) Saturday morning at 9:30.
Head coach Rolf Piranian com-
mented on the strength of the
Fords: ‘“They’re known for hav-
ing a superb soccer program.
We were fortunate to get them
on our schedule; however, we
will definitely go into the con-
test as underdogs.”

Get Hot

Haverford will bring a
somewhat misleading 0-2
record into Lexington. The

losses have been to Johns
Hopkins (1-0 on September 12)
and Villanova (4-3 on the 16th).
Eastern Mennonite will be the
second 0.D.A.C. opponent of the
season for the Generals when
they meet at 3:30 this Tuesday
on Wilson Field. Coach Pira-
nian does not expect the team to
dominate Mennonite like it has
in previous years. ‘‘They’re
much improved since last fall,
especially on offense.’ The
Royals have a 2-2 record to date
but are scheduled for two more
games before playing W&L.
Piranian believes that the

 

Generals’ chances for success

in these two home games will
depend on how well the team
practices this week. He adds,
“Our offense has performed
quite well thus far by taking ad-
vantage of most opportunities
and by keeping pressure on the
opponent’s goal area. We
believe that for us to have a
good season, the offense will
have to be our strength.”

 

The law school’s independent
and fraternities will field teams
in intramural competition
beginning this week. Football,
golf, and tennis will be the
sports this fall. Sigma Phi Ep-
silon won last year’s competi-
tion compiling 1186 of a possible
1400 points followed by Phi Kap-
pa Psi and Phi Delta Theta in
third.

The Generals in action at the Revue Fall Classic.

Polo Team Takes Second

“by G. Bruce Potter

The Washington & Lee water
polo team opened its season
with “a°4-1 record, good for se-
cond'place, in the Revue Fal
Classic last weekend. ,

The Generals dropped the
championship game to Slippery
Rock,.Pa., 13-5, but scored wins
over national powerhouses
California Tech, 11-9, and Ken-
tucky, 11-10.

The Kentucky game was
perhaps the most exciting of the
tournament as senior Mike Ber-
not netted his fourth goal of the
game with eight seconds left to
give the Generals the victory.
Co-captain Erik Peterson also
tallied four times as W&L re-
bounded from a 7-4 halftime
deficit.

Coach Page Remillard was
pleased with the victory over
Kentucky. “We didn’t plan it
quite that way (Bernot’s game-
winner), but we knew that!
California Tech, Kentucky, and’
we were about equal. We prov-
ed that the opponent can’t just!

stop one’ man (Peterson) and’

expect to beat us.” tC

California Tech jumped out to’

a quick 2-0 lead in the first
period against the Generals, but
four power play goals, two by
sophomore Rand McClain, gave
W&L a 5-4 halftime lead.

Only 53 seconds into the third
quarter, Cal Tech knotted the
score at five. Then Peterson

took over, scoring the first of his’

four goals that quarter at the
2:34 mark to give the Generals
a 6-5 lead that they would never

  

relinquish.

When the third quarter
onslaught had ended, W&L had
a 10-5 lead that Cal Tech could
not overcome, although _ it
scored three goals in a two-
minute span following Peter-
son’s departure from the game
with three fouls.

Peterson explained that he
had played conservatively dur-
ing the opening games of the
tournament, Johns Hopkins and
MIT, but was given ‘“‘the free-
dom to go outside”’ against Cal
Tech. He claimed that the Cal
Tech players were keying on
him when he got his second foul.

The Generals committed five
turnovers in the first three
minutes of the championship
finale against Slippery Rock,
and the Rockets’ tenacious de-
fense held them scoreless for
two of the first three quarters.
Slippery Rock took a 1-0 lead at
the 3:49 mark of the first period,
and W&L failed to convert on
two power plays later in the
quarter. The General§., would
squelch six more short-handed
opportunities before the game
ended.

Slippery Rock scored the first
tally early in the second period,
but the Generals came roaring
back on a goal by Bernot, who
finished the tournament with 16,

to cut the margin to 2-1. The
Rockets then scored three goals
within a minute and a half to
gain a commanding lead.

Down 6-3 at the half, W&L
came out of the locker room
hoping to effect a comeback.
But it was not to be as All-
American Tim Rock fouled out
15 seconds into the second half,
signalling the end of the Gen-
erals’ chances. The Rockets
would add three more goals in
the third quarter while shutting
out the Generals, and although
junior Bob Marshall came off
the bench to net two General
goals in the last minutes of the
game, it was too little, too late,
as Slippery Rock added four
goals themselves in a_ sub-
stitute-filled fourth quarter.

Remillard had labeled Slip-
pery Rock as_ the _ pre-
tournament favorite and the
Rockets lived up to their billing.
He denied that the Generals had
suffered a letdown following the
big wins over Cal Tech and Ken-
tucky, saying, ‘‘they wanted to
win, and this (loss) will help
next week in workouts.”

In their first: two games of
the tourney, W&L downed
Johns Hopkins, 15-11, and MIT,

15-6.

Famous Autographs
On Display In Library

A handwritten note signed
with a flourish by the incom-
parable Enrico Caruso. A reser-
vation for dinner bearing the
signature of Franz Liszt. An
1888 contract signed by Lillie
Langtry, better known as
“Jersey Lily,’’ alongside four
letters from her flamboyant
contemporary, Sarah Bern-
hardt. And a Christmas card
autographed by actor Lionel
Barrymore.

Those are a few of the items
‘nan unusual autograph collec-
tion that is currently on display
in the University Library at
Washington & Lee.

Autographs and letters signed
by actors and actresses, musi-
cians and composers, some dat-
ing back to the mid-1800s are
part of the collection donated to
the university by Carter N.
Bealer, who attended W&L
from 1918 to 1922.

Bealer, who died in 1965, be-
queathed his collection of col-
lections -- ranging from ship’s
menus to hotel stickers. — to the
university.

intl recently the Bealer col-

lections were collecting dust in
a storage room of the library.

But this summer Richard
Oram, reference and public ser-
vices librarian at W&L, began
combing through the contents of
the boxes of memorabilia.

Oram marvels at what he
found contained in those boxes.

“The scope of Mr. Bealer’s
collections is truly amazing,”
Oram said. ‘In addition to the
autographs of over a hundred
proriinent actors and actres-
ses, there is a collection of near-
ly 1,500 theatre programs
dating from 1860 until Mr. Beal-
er’s death in 1965. He also col-
lected autographed pictures of
performers, ranging from Al
Jolson to Noel Coward.

‘‘We are still in the process of
determining exactly what other
items we have in the collection,
but it is all rather fascinating.”’

The Bealer Autograph Collec-
tion is on display in the Univer-
sity Library’s. special collec-
tions room and is open to the
public daily from 9 am. — 5
p.m.

 

Sinfonia

(continued from page 4)

In 1961, Houtmann won first
prize in the Dimitri Mitropoulos
International Music Competi-
tion for Conductors in New
York. The prize brought with it
the position of assistant conduc-
tor, under Leonard Bernstein,
of the New York Philharmonic.

Since 1965, Houtmann has
been invited to conduct or-
chestras all over the world. In
his native France, he served as
conductor for the French Na-
tional Orchestras, the Philhar-
monique, the Colonne, the

Lamoureux. and the Rhone-
Alpes Philharmonic Orches-
tras. He has been guest conduc-
tor of the New York Philhar-
monic, the Atlanta Symphony,
the Oregon Symphony of
America as well as with or-
chestras in Europe and South
America.

The concert by the Richmond
Sinfonia is the first in a series of
six programs to be presented by
the Washington & Lee Universi-
ty Concert Guild this academic
year. Season tickets are still
available at $10 for all six con-
certs.

Alumni Make Donation

Two 1981 graduates of Wash-
ington & Lee University, Marc
Firestone of New York City and
David Finley of Dayton, O.,
made a noteworthy donation to
the university this fall.

Firestone and Finley, both
philosophy majors at W&L,
were named in June as co-
winners of The Young Scholar-
ship in Philosophy, which is
presented annually to the stu-
dent (or, in this instance,
students) writing the senior
thesis judged best by the
department. The scholarship
carries an annual value of $125.

Firestone and. Finley chose to
donate the proceeds from The
Young Scholarship to W&L’s
philosophy department, sug-
gesting that the contribution be
used to help furnish the new
philosophy seminar room in
recently renovated Newcomb
Hall.

As a result of the contribu-
tion, a wall-size mural showing
the earth as seen from a van-
tage point on the moon now
decorates the philosophy sem-
inar room, and a wall plaque
recognizes the gift made by
Firestone and Finley.

Debate

Tourney

A debating team representing
the College of William and
Mary won the varsity competi-
tion in the Washington & Lee
Debate Tournament last week-
end.

Davidson’s novice team won
over William and Mary in the
novice round. :

Twenty teams representing
nine schools_participated in the
novice and varsity divisions. In
addition to William and Mary
and Davidson, the schools re-
presented in the tournament
were the University of North
Carolina at Charlotte, West
Virginia University, Appala-
chian State University, Wake
Forest University, Liberty Bap-
tist College, Alderson-Broaddus
College, and Washington and
Lee.

The W&L tournament is the
first of the academic year in the
nation and gives competing
teams an early look at the
development of the national
topic that will be debated by col-
lege teams throughout the year.
This year’s topic is ‘‘Resolved:
That the Federal Government
should significantly curtail the
powers of labor unions.’’ Teams
debated the affirmative and
negative of that proposition dur-
ing the tournament.

—-Miss Liliian Spouts Off Again ——

A story went out on the AP wire last week in which excerpts from
an interview with Lillian Carter were published. In it, Mrs. Carter
attacked first lady Nancy Reagan for ruining the White House with
her Hollywood-style taste.

This came about when the matriarch of the Carter clan was ask-
ed to respond to reports that Mrs. Reagan was shocked by the con-
dition in which she found the executive mansion. Miss Lillian said
that Mrs. Reagan shocked her, that she didn’t know what kind of
taste Mrs. Reagan has, but she supposed it was Hollywood taste.

 

John Wells

 

 

TASTE

 

Now it is ironic that Miss Lillian, whose standard public attire is
a double-knit pants suit, should take it upon herself to criticize
anybody on grounds of taste. Since she labeled the Reagans’ taste

by using the name of their home base, it seems fair and appropriate -

to refer to her taste as Plains Taste.

;
(0)

Plains Taste left the White House ‘a$the Reagans found it

January 20: parquet floor and baseboard damage suffered when

Amy Carter converted the East Room into a roller-boogie rink for :

party held after her daddy’s humiliating defeat; reminders of a_

puppy the Carters kept for months but failed to housetrain; worn
furnishings and dirty walls from scores of Carter kin who lived |

there from time to time during four years,

So the Reagans found the place looking like a Holiday Inn suite
that had been rented and used by the entire Hee Haw Gang during

the previous term. Nancy hired decorator Ted Graber to fix the.

place up at the expense of a private fund set up by Reagan buddies.
Graber’s credits include the American Embassy in London. That's
Hollywood taste.

Plains Taste eschews Chippendale for Sears, damask for
polyester, walnut for plywood. It is interesting to note that the ex-
First Mother failed to criticize Nancy’s taste as exhibited by her
highly publicized wardrobe. Lillian, you’ll remember, made the
papers with her “JIMMY WON’”’ T-shirt in 1976. She was also her
son’s official representative at the funeral of the late Yugoslavian
President Tito, who, by anyone’s standards, was one of the most
significant political leaders of this century. For this solemn occa-
sion, Miss Lillian shunned international protocol (black dress and
gloves) for her Plains Taste rumpled tan J.C. Penny raincoat (also
her attire at Jimmy’s swearing-in — it looked real folksy next to
Betty Ford’s mink). :

Finally, the grande dame of Plains attacked Mrs. Reagan on the
groundless, false charge that the first lady plans to knock out a wall
in the Lincoln Bedroom. Apparently Miss Lillian is selective in
gathering information, choosing to believe what she wants and tak-
ing as fact idle gossip and lies. Her mindless public, all of whom
probably read the National Enquirer, will undoubtedly take her
pronouncements as unequivocal truth.

Miss Lillian, 82, stated in the interview that she found White
House living dull — walking, drinking, dining and watching T.V.
She expressed a fondness for the chamber always reserved for her
frequent visits, the Queen’s Bedroom. And a fitting room it must
have been for a woman as regal as Miss Lillian, who, after all, is
Queen of the Carter Tribe.

The Reagans have been roundly criticized for living sumptuously
while the president slashes away at social programs. The public
will be the ultimate’critic of their lifestyle. But for anyone to put
down their taste — especially one as utterly unqualified as Lillian
Carter — is a bit much. Her words should be taken for what they
are: sour grapes from an old prune.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK 2? Cheers

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Security

Security, or the lack thereof, is again becoming an
issue on this campus. At this time, however, all we
can offer is some good news and some bad news.

First the good news. Apparently the university has
conceded that security was lacking last year and has
added an extra man to its squad. New lights were add-
ed on the footbridge that connects the main campus
with the law school and the athletic fields. These are
both steps in the right direction.

Now for the bad news. Despite the improvements,
some of last year’s problems remain unsolved. Stu-
dents have already suffered incidents of vandalism in
the Woods Creek parking lot and the streets surroun-
ding the Student Center continue to be hunting
grounds for thieves, burglars, etc.

In the Woods Creek matter, perhaps the university
should consider a new method for patrolling the area.
While a zero crime rate is unlikely, the ability of a
group of thieves to strip a car of all its tires and go un-
noticed indicates that something is wrong.

As for the Student Center, newer and stronger
lighting would be a good first step. A request should
be made to the Lexington City Council to improve the
lighting of both Washington and Lee Sts. Meanwhile,
the university should install stronger lights on the out-
side of the building itself.

The university should be applauded for recognizing
the security problem and taking action. But if the
university believes that the security problem will now
disappear, it is infor a rude awakening.

Bids

This Friday night, many freshmen will be given an
option that can alter the course of their four years at
W&L. Bids can be accepted on Friday and one has to
wonder how many freshmen will tear before giving
the house of their choice a good and hard look.

We are neither commending nor condoning the fra-
ternity system. We only hope that Friday night’s
choice is one based on common sense, rather than im-
pulse. Joining a fraternity can be an expensive and
time-consuming endeavor. It is a decision not to be

taken lightly.
Changes

Readers with a flair for the artistic may have notic-
ed some changes in last week’s edition of the Phi.
Alterations were made in the masthead and sectional
logos to give the paper a more contemporary look.
Similarly, the comic strip ‘‘Doonesbury”’ has been ad-
ded as a weekly feature.

In these ways we hope to improve the quality of our
product. You may find typographical errors or other
miscues from week to week, but at least our public
knows that we are trying to raise the standards of this

publication.

For
Mr. Smith

Dear Editor:

Three cheers for Todd Smith,
and a couple of bids, too. His
observations about the rush
situation at W&L should be
given serious consideration.
Last week’s paper would have
been much more in tune with
things if its headline had been
‘Rush is Declared.”’

His central point, let rush be
delayed, would greatly benefit
this institution if acted upon.
The rush experience is
beneficial and needed at W&L.
However, the way it tends to
dominate the first month of the
school year is not in the in-
terests of the university or the
freshman class. Preconceived
ideas about the necessity of
rush being at the beginning of
the school year are the result of
rush having always been at the
beginning of the school year.

What are some possible ad-
vantages of students not being
literally rushed (blindly herd-
ed) into the fraternity system?
First of all, there would not be
the tremendous pressure on
freshmen to make such a monu-
mentous momentous social and
financial commitment so soon.

Delaying rush would allow
freshmen to develop a more ob-
jective view of the fraternity
system and to see which frater-
nity appealed to them, if any.
Without the tremendous
amount of energy and time
devoted to rush, the up-
perclassmen and freshmen
would have time to pursue some
of the extra-curricular ac-
tivities that interest them.

 

Delaying rush
would allow
freshmen to

of Woods Creek, it’s not so safe.

An atmosphere more in line
with the liberal ideals of the
university might be ignited;
students pursuing specialized
studies, working for the univer-
sity federation, i.e. an overall
decrease in student apathy.

Are generalities about the
liberal education at W&L re-
lated to the logistical position of
rush? This reader thinks so.
The university, the student
body, and the fraternity system
as a whole would benefit from a
delayed rush. Obviously, this
issue cannot be addressed in a
few newspaper articles. I sug-
gest that the E.C. or the Inter-
Fraternity Council or the ap-
propriate representative body
appoint a committee to re-
search this idea and consider its
possibilities.

Sincerely,

Symposium

Dear Editor:

In recent months, much time
and thought has been commit-
ted to answering the feasibility
of establishing a symposium or
convocation (i.e. a university-
wide consideration of a critical
public issue culminating in a
town meeting, a white paper,
and a competition). The con-
cept is similar in structure to
Washington & Lee’s Mock Con-
vention.

The University Council and
its various subcommittees have
investigated this proposal, and
determined several goals and
objectives: (1) A symposium
could help to unify the campus.
(2) Interdisciplinary learning
needs to take place.

(3) Critical thinking would be
encouraged.

(4) The symposium would
demonstrate that liberal educa-
tion takes place outside the
classroom as well as inside.

(5) Participation in seminars
and individualized research
would be encouraged.

(6) A symposium could re-
juvenate the spring term.

(7) It could guide academic or
career objectives for students.
(8) Opportunities for leadership
would be expanded.

(9) An intellectual symposium
would add a distinctive feature
to academic and student life at
Washington & Lee, much as the
Mock Convention does.

 

“It might live or
die depending on
the first topic...”

Dr. Thomas
Williams

 

What we envision is a
quadrennial event occurring
two years after every Mock
Convention. Research,
seminars, and _ independent
study would be designed in ac-
cordance with a selected topic,
to afford students and faculty
the opportunity to investigate
various aspects of the issue at
hand. Such topics could include
athletics and education, govern-
ment and the individual, and
world hunger, to name a few.

To assure the success of the
program, some type of ‘‘finale
weekend” would be planned,
featuring keynote speakers and
different activities. . The
highlight of the weekend would
be the production and presenta-
tion of a platform or white
paper which would attract the
interest of the media, and other
institutions.

This is merely a cursory in-
troduction to what could

“No, I don’t think it happened that way,’’ said the EcSec
(Newspeak for Executive Committee Secretary )

“‘T really do think that the Freshman Law elections were moved
back,’’ responded the RiPhHak (Ring-tum Phi journalist). But
Smith said it trembling. Was he the only one to remember it, a
minority of one?

Producing the minutes, the EcSec read that the motion had fail-
ed. He smiled as if to say, ‘There, your memory is undisciplined,
you thought criminal.”

No, no, no. Smith concealed his rapid breathing with ‘the
characteristic, moronic smile. He could remember talking to Willis
and Mackie. The two EcReps had said that to move up the Law
School Freshman Elections would fly in the face of the Constitution.

He remembered how then-president-elect Myers (now called Big’
Deadbear) had fought the constitution to move the
LawFreshEcRep elections to a date earlier in the year, thereby im-
proving representation.

‘‘The Constitution isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on,”’ expound-
ed Big Deadbear.

The EcSec read further. While the measure was later passed
claiming a loophole in the Consitution, it was subject to this year’s
ExCom’s approval. ‘‘We never reconsidered it,” said the EcSec. |"

‘Myers spoke against the motion, saying it flew in the face of the
constitution,” continued the EcRep. 4

watched from a small rectangular Big Budget on the wall. A ques-
tionable expression, a nervous twitch, or even a rapid heartbeat
could alert the Commandos. Every prole knows the fear of the mid-
night tromp of boots on stair and door, the dark hearing in the
catacombs, and the anonymous, traceless dissappearance, forever
wrapped in silence. With a poker-face, the RiPhHak found the
sliver of history he needed. It detailed a coup against last year’s
EcPres Willis, a.k.a. Big Boo Boo. At an April meeting, the ExCom
voted 6-4 against Big Boo Boo, Mackie, Nogay, and Hale, to move
LawFreshEcRep elections despite the coustitutional specifica-
tions.

Big Deadbear had become fed up with a student body that:would
not revise its constitution. Several elections throughout the year
failed to produce a majority of voters. Now, the fairirepresentation
of the LawProles, whose calendar had been changed since the
writing of the constitution, was at stake. “he ExCom voted for
fairness over constitutionality, and over Big +00 Boo.

A ghost appeared at the second ExComintern (meeting). Just
when you thought someone had become an unperson, they would
reappear for a year or two before dissappearing forever. So it was
with Steve Abraham. Once EcPres himself, Abraham reappeared
as a LawProle.

Abraham pleaded for earlier LawFreshEcRep elections,
LawFreshProles were i:: school for ten weeks before they had a peer
on the ExCom. All nodded yes, yes, a great discrepancy, and some
suggested having mone; votes on the constitution. “‘Another year
has passed,’’ noted Big Deadbear, ‘‘we will havetto try to change it
for next year,” which is just what Big Boo Boo had said before.

They had won the victory over indiscipline. They loved their con-

W&L Theatre to Hold
3 Major Productions

The Washington & Lee Uni-
versity Theatre will present
three major productions during
the 1981-82 academic year, be-
ginning with “The Country
Wife,’’ a comedy act in Restora-
tion England and scheduled for
Nov. 9-14 in the Troubadour
Theatre.

The other presentations of
W&L’s University Theatre will
' “Man. of La Mancha"
(March 22-27, 1982) and
‘Scapino!”’ (May 24-28, 1982).

The University Theatre will
hold an open house Tuesday,
Sept. 22, at 8 p.m. at the
Troubadour. Anyone interested
in working in any of the theatre
productions is invited to attend,
according to Albert C. Gordon,
professor of tine arts at W&L
and director uf the University
Theatre.

“All three of the productions
are open not only to W&L
studcuts, but to any member of
the Lexington community,”
Gordon explained. ‘In the open-
ing play, “The Country Wife,”’
there are seven parts for men
and seven for women. The

women’s parts are all very good
and are extremely varied.”’

Open auditions for ‘The
Country Wife’’ will be held at
the Troubadour Theatre on
Sept. 24 and 25 at 4:30 p.m. and
7 p.m. Gordon is the director for
the play.

Auditions will be announced
later for ‘‘Man of La Mancha”’
anc: “Scapino!"’. Gordon will be
the director for ‘““Man of La
Mancha,”’ the musical comedy
based on Cervantes’ Don Quix-
ote and his ‘impossible
dreams.”’ Paula Langdon, in-
structor in drania, will direct
‘‘Scapino!”’ a modern stage ver-
sion Of Moliere’s farce,
“Seapin,”’

In addition to the three major
productions, the University.

Theatre will also present an

original work by a W&L student

Dorm Experiences

(continued from page 1)

some cases, students have
taken out one desk in order to
create some more room.

Hunter Benes lives on the
first floor of Gilliam. He is occu-
pying one of the smallest rooms
on campus. Benes said that it is
hard having a roommate
because there’s not much room.
He goes to the library to study.
In describing his room, Benes
stated, ‘‘It’s liveable, I guess.’
He also proved that he’s a sensi-
ble student when he said ‘I’m
not going to transfer because of
it (the room).”

“This isn’t at all what I ex-
pected,’’ said Andy Haring, who
resides in a room on the top
floor of Gilliam. Last year when
he visited the campus, his guide
showed him nice rooms with
one person in each of them.
“Then I came here and saw my
cubicle, and it was a less-than-
pleasant surprise,’’ he remark-
ed. Haring knows that he has no
choice except to live in his room
and make the best of it. But he
spends very little time in his
“cubicle”, saying, “It’s just
basically a place for me to
sleep.”

Andy Berisford is another
resident of a crowded room in
Gilliam Dorm.

“It took a lot of adjusting,’’ he
said. Speaking about his rela-
tionship with his roommate,
Randall Ray, Berisford com-
mented, ‘‘The main thing is we
have to work at not getting on
each. other’s nerves, because
we're living on top of each other
like this.”

Berisford studies in the
library and he noted that there
is no room for his stereo in his
room, although his roommate
has one. Their room is crowded
with furniture, with everything
crammed against everything
else. They share a rather small
closet and towels can’t be hung
on the towel rack because the
dresser is right next to it.
Berisford said that his room-
mate doesn’t complain to him
about the conditions.

Berisford has also learned to
live with a room of such small
size. ‘I’ve had to adjust from
the beginning,”’ he said. ‘I’m a
rather adaptive person. What
else can you do (except
adapt)?”

Judging by the comments of
the residents of the smallest
rooms in Gilliam, W&L fresh-
men have quickly learned to ad-
just to the conditions. The dorm
counselors have noticed that
some students just make jokes
about the living space in
Gilliam, or lack of it, in this
situation.

It is almost certain, and Dean
Huntley is aware, that the most
difficult time will come during
mid-terms and final exams. Un-
til then, the students living in
the small rooms of Gilliam will
just have to continue to adapt
and adjust. And the students in
the larger rooms of Gilliam will
probably continue to make com-
ments similar to one Barry
Whitaker made. Referring to

Reps. to Host Picnic Sat.

The Washington & Lee Col-
lege Republicans will have their
Annual Fall Picnic this Satur-
day on the Law School Field
from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Enter-
tainment will be provided by
the Halls of Grass. Guests are to
include College Republicans
from Hollins, Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College, Sweet Briar,
Mary Baldwin, William &
Mary, Virginia Tech and
others.

“All W&L students interested
in the political process and

responsible government are en-
couraged to attend,”’ said Club
President Kelly Niernberger.
Club memberships will be
available at the picnic. In addi-
tion, members who have not yet
paid their dues will be asked to
do so at that time.

Campaign Chairman Dennis
Roberts characterized the An-
nual Picnic as the ‘‘kick-off for
our efforts in the fall guber-
natorial campaign. With the

governor making threatening
statements about private
education in Virginia, it is im-
perative that we defeat those
who are a menace to our in-

Niernberger urges everyone
to ‘‘come on out to what should
be the best pre-game warm-up
of the season. Then join us at
Wilson Field as our own Gen-
erals take on Centre College. It
should be a grand old time for
the Grand Old Party.”

Merchants
Concerned

By Thefts

by Tom Baker

Most people think that
speeding, public drunkeness
and noise violations are the only
infractions of the law that
Washington & Lee students are
ever involved in. Shoplifting,
however, is becoming a concern
for Lexington merchants as
well as the Commonwealth At-
torney’s office.

According to Robert Candea,
president of the Lexington
Retail Merchants Association
and manager of Spanky’s, shop-
lifting by W&L students is
becoming an_ increasingly
serious problem for local
storeowners.

Candea said that the situation
usually involves a student who
is drunk, without cash, or look-
ing for something exciting to do.
The shoplifter will conceal
something of little value and try
to walk out with it. Candea has
already had two such instances
take place at Spanky’s this year
as opposed to no such instances
last year.

In both instances Candea let
the students involved go but did
‘put a nice scare into them.”’
Candea, as well as other local
merchants, is hesitant of filing
charges for several reasons.
Candea and others recognize
that students, who tend not to
consider the implications of
their actions fully, have a lot to
lose by a petty larceny convic-
tion.

Storekeepers are often unwill-
ing to prosecute because of the
bad publicity, the lost work
time and the lost revenue a stu-
dent, who shops frequently at a
store, can generate. Candea
added that local merchants are

- Vassar Clements to Fiddle
Away In Homecoming Concert

by John Wells

Renowned fiddler Vassar
Clements will open Washington
& Lee’s 1981 Homecoming with
a concert in Warner Gym-
nasium on Friday, Oct. 9. The
show, which will begin at 8:30,
marks Clements’ first Lexing-
ton appearance since 1976.

SAB Co-chairman John Mar-
tin said admission to thé con-
cert will be free for W&L
students and their dates, but
that proper identification (stu-
dent I.D. or library card) must
be shown at the door. He said
that tickets for unescorted
females and others not from the
W&L community will be
available at $3 each.

There will be three ticket win-
dows and local policemen on
hand, according to Martin. All
these measures are being taken
to eliminate problems like those
experienced in the same loca-
tion at last year’s John Prine
concert, when scores of non-
W&L students got choice seats
for nothing.

Clements will be preceded
onstage by John Proussett of
the Proussett Dart Band
(‘‘Amnesia,” ‘County Line’)
who will open the show.

For a decade Vassar
Clements has been widely
respected for his musical talent
and versatility, and has been
called by some ‘“‘the premier
fiddler of the world.’’ He has
either performed and/or
recorded with practically
everyone in the business from
The Grateful Dead to The
Boston Pops. Even a partial
listing is impressive: The
Allman Brothers, J.J. Kale, The
Byrds, Paul McCartney, Linda
Ronstadt, The Band, Kris
Kristofferson, John Prine, The

Marshall Tucker Band, Steve
Martin, Bonnie Raitt, Elvin
Bishop, Maybelle Carter - and
ee Cody, to name a
ew.

Clements plays _ bluegrass,
blues, jazz, rock and traditional
melodies and was largely in-
fluenced in his early years by
the big band sound of the 1940s.
He told a reporter in 1979: “I

perform for Homecoming.

want people to like what I play.
I put myself in the audience’s
position and think of what. I
want to hear. Everyone’s tastes
are different. So, I want to play
it all.”

Born in Florida in 1932,
Clements never had a fiddle
lesson and left home at the age
of 13 to pursue a career in
music. His childhood dream
came true in 1949 when he
played at the Grand Old Opry in
Nashville, the country music
mecca. That appearance was
with Bill Monroe, and in 1950
Vassar made his first record as
a member of Monroe’s Blue-
grass Boys.

He spent years traveling back

and forth between Nashville
and his home in Orlando, and
was employed in a variety of
capacities. He moved to Nash-
ville in 1969 and in 1971 was ask-
ed to record on the Nitty Gritty
Dirt Band’s classic ‘‘Will The
Circle Be Unbroken.’’ He was
an overnight success, with im-
mediate offers for recording
sessions and guest appearances
with other musicians.

“The Dirt Band and John
Hartford were so important to
my career,’’ Clements said in
an interview. ‘“‘They’re the first
ones who let me play what I
wanted to play.”’

Hartford, a country song-
writer and performer, gave
Clements his unique fiddle nine
years ago. The fiddle is said by
the Smithsonian Institute to be
more than 450 years old and
probably crafted by Italian gyp-
sies. Vassar likes it; on the road
most of each year, he considers
himself a gypsy.

NUMBER 3

Holds
Marathon
Session

by Todd Smith

Two a.m. had passed when
the Student Activities Board
made its budget requests to the
Executive Committee. Some on
the E.C. had been drinking cof-
fee and cola since 6:30 p.m.,
some on the SAB had been
drinking bee’ in the Cockpit,
and no one looked very good.

Fifteen organizations — pre-
sented funding requests to the
E.C. during the eight hour ses-
sion Monday night. Over $92,000
was allocated in a budget that
has yet to be completed, revised
and approved.

The E.C. set the figure
of $39,000 as the preliminary
SAB budget. This amounts to
about 42 percent of the night's
allocations.

Of the SAB allocation, $13,000
is stipulated for use by thx
University Center Committee
Chaired by Bob Schmidt, th
UCC arranges Cockpit enter
tainment. Schmidt had _ re-
quested three thousand dollars
more than he got, but still was
given tentatively three thou-
sand more than last year.

The rest of the SAB was
allocated $26,000, which is
$13,000 below their request, and
about equal to last year’s
budget.

Pressure from the Fire Mar-
shall has forced this year’s Fan-
cy Dress Ball into the new Gym,
according to SAB Co-Chairman
Blake Witherington.

Fancy Dress will therefore be
open to Alumni and guests of
W&L students in addition to the
student body.

The Bands will be announced
as soon as possible to draw
alumni and news coverage. In-

W&L Drops Centre

by Dale Park

Trailing 14-0 after only one
period of play, the Washington
& Lee varsity football team
recovered for a 24-14 victory
over the Centre College Col-
onels last Saturday on Wilson
Field.

A crowd of 1,864 watched Cen-
tre strike early in the first
quarter on a 60-yard touchdown
pass and again as time expired
in the quarter on a one-yard
scoring run.

“Their 7-0) lead didn’t bother
me so much because they got it
on a long pass,”’ offered head

coach Gary Fallon. ‘People |
tend to make mistakes against |
long passes. What worried me |
was that our defense seemed |
unable to stop them on their |
next scoring drive.”’
W&L retaliated late in the se- |
cond quarter when sophomore |
quarterback Al Paradise hit |
junior wide-receiver Phil |
Hrabar with a 22-yard touch-
down pass that cut Centre’s
lead to 14-7.
Yet the key play in the game |
occurred late in the third
period. After moving deep into

A team of biomedical in-
vestigators, including Washing-
ton & Lee University psychol-
ogy professor H.E. King, has
been awarded a $226,000 grant
to support its continued
research into the behavioral
consequences of hypertension.

The three-year grant was
made by the National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute. King
and two co-principal scientists
from the University of Pitts-
burgh School of Medicine will
use the grant to continue their
detailed investigation of
changes in behavior which may
result from marked and persis-
tent elevation of the cerebral
blood pressure.

“There is no more important
health consideration facing our
nation today than maintaining
appropriate levels of blood
pressure,”’ said King, who join-
ed the W&L faculty in 1977.

“With the varied means for
effective treatment and control
now available, the remaining
problem is mostly educational:
better understanding by the
general public about the need
for carefully monitoring blood
pressure, from the first sign of
unusual elevation, and an in-
creased understanding by the

biomedical community about
all aspects of the hypertensive
condition, including those
behavioral components that are
related to both cause and ef-
fect.”

King and his colleagues at
Pitt have centered their atten-
tion on the effect hypertension
has on brain function as it
becomes manifest in behavior.

Although a great deal of at-
tention has been given to life-
stress as a contributing cause in
hypertensive disorder, there
has been relatively little ex-
ploration made of the possible
consequences of the altered
physiological state for behav-
ior. Since the brain is one of the
three bodily organs, along with
the heart and kidney, most like-
ly to be affected by persistent
blood pressure elevations, this
team of investigators elected to
center its attention on brain
function.

The team’s initial studies,
made of men and women with
very recently diagnosed mild
hypertension, have been able to
demonstrate a characteristic
pattern of altered behavior in
sensory-perceptual, psycho-
motor, and cognitive function-
ing when such patients are ask-

ed to perform under an imposed
“load” or mild stress. Accor-
ding to King, the situation is
best likened to the use of tread-
mill-pacing for probing the
details of cardiac or respiratory
function under a mild and con-
trolled work load.

Dr. Alvin Shapiro, head of the
Hypertension Clinic at Pitts-
burgh’s School of Medicine, will
be responsible for patient selec-
tion and all medical aspects of
the experimental program.

Drs. King and Robert E.
Miller, both research psycholo-
gists with long experience in
evaluating relationships _bet-
ween the human brain and be-
havior, will conduct the behav-
ioral research.

The three investigators have
been associated for many years
at the Pitt medical school. Since
joining the W&L faculty, Dr.
King has changed his appoint-
ment at the University of Pitts-
burgh to that of adjunct pro-
fessor. He will continue to be in
residence in Pittsburgh during
the summer months and will
make periodic on-site visits to
the research program on week-
ends throughout the academic
year in order to supervise the
collection of behavioral test
data.

Dr. King indicated that it is
likely the Washington & Lee
computer facilities will assist in
making an analysis of the data
to be gathered during the three-
year period of active study.

The Other Side
Of Randy Mac

Randolph-Macon Woman's Col-
lege
Lynchburg, Va.

Mark Smith ‘83 is one mink
down the road almost every
night of the week. He does it to
keep up his grades.

The only male exchange stu-
dent at Randolph-Macon, Smith
is often asked if he leads the
Sultan’s life.

Of the surrounding girls’
schools, R-MWC shares a
reputation of being the most in-
telligent with Hollins. Yet,
every mink knows that Randy
Mac girls are majoring in
French or Art History, and can-
not converse above the Skiing,
Travel and Tennis level.

Sometimes, minks
think.

Macon has plenty to teach
W&L. ‘‘They have what I would
call a sense of community,”
says Smith. ‘‘They aren’t just a
group of divergent people.’’

Cookie Cutter Atmosphere

The Yale Daily's Insider's
Guide compares R-MWC to a
girl scout camp, with a student
body molded by identical cookie
cutters. Others would credit the
school-girl traditions with the
sense of unity that pervades the
725 woman campus.

One tradition is the Rain Peo-
ple. Smith was startled to see
women in hoods and black robes
chanting ‘‘like an _ occult
chapter’’ and marching across
the front campus, as they do at
midnight after every rainy day.

Secret Societies are also
traditional. Last year, Delta Mu
dressed up the parking lot with
Used Car Lot signs and flags,
soaping prices on every wind-
Shield. The year before, every-
one’s toothbrush was stolen.
The year before that they
advertised the campus for sale
in the Washington Post.

‘When you have a school this
small, students with so many in-
terests, and such a big work-
load, traditions help to keep up
school spirit,” says Valerie
Sands ‘83.

“Sometimes you ‘just don’t
want to fool with it—‘Please go
away!’ But it contributes to the
continuity of this school, its

Sands returns to R-MWC,
after spending her sophomore
year at Florida State University
in Tallahassee. ‘(To return) is
to trade away a Social life for
academics,” said Sands.

“The academics at FSU are
totally beneath what they are
here. I would go to class and not
get anything out of it.”’

‘Professors here like to teach
very much, said Sands. ‘‘They
learn your name, make you
read, and teach you to think.”’

‘‘We are sisters.”’

Without sororities, the women
organize by dorm. Each dorm
elects officers; each floor sends
representatives to the Student
Legislature. They have a Stu-
dent Activities Board and an
Executive Committee.

With the inclusion of the
President and select faculty on
the E.C. may encumber student
autonomy, it gives the students
representation in curriculum
changes.

“It’s like we are all sisters,”
comments Renee Hansard ‘84,
secretary of Bell Dorm. Par-
ties, dances, and lectures are
arranged by the dorms.

One of the reasons for enroll-
ing only women is the idea that
women can be taught to be
assertive if men are removed
from the classroom.

“If you can’t function with
men in the real world, then just
bag it,”’ says Barbet Rucker ‘82.
Rucker has just returned from
a college-sponsored year in
Spain despite misgivings about
Randoph-Macon.

“T think the idea of —
tion of the sexes is wrong,...
leads to unhealthy sida.
ships,” states Rucker.

Although ‘‘the academics are
good and the campus is beauti-
ful,’’ Rucker dislikes the social |
life. ‘I think it’s immature to |
run to (W&L and the other col- |
leges in the area) every |
weekend. I know of some people |
who go up there just to laugh at
the guys.”’

 

‘A Healthy Atmosphere”’
President Robert Spivey says
he hears few complaints from
students who feel cloistered.

Review:

by Todd Jones

This week, I was supposed to
see Eye of the Needle, starring
Donald Sutherland. However,
the Lyric tricked me by delay-
ing the arrival of this movie by
a week. I figured not too many
people would be interested in a
second review of Arthur, which
is still playing at the State, so I
took in the Lyric’s current ‘ter-
ror thriller,’ Night School. I feel
I cannot fully explain my reac-
tions to this film without first
explaining the circumstances
under which I viewed it. Upon
entering the theatre, I could not
help but assume that I had ar-
rived early, for the theatre was
empty. However, shortly after I
sat down, the lights dimmed. I

treated to a private showing.
This was advantageous, as the
movie was incredibly bad.
Given the size of the audience,
though, I did not feel the least
bit embarrassed for laughing
instead of shrieking in terror.

Night School stars Rachel
Ward and Drew Snyder, who, if
their performances continue at
this level, will no doubt be box-
office smashes by the year 2010.
Drew, a Harvard grad working
on the Boston police force (as
all Harvard men do these
days), spends most of his time
wearing preppy clothes and
driving a BMW. Along with ex-
plaining the inner motives of
the killer and expressing his
logical views on life (as any
Harvard alum would), he also
curses, to show us that under-
neath his cultured upbringing is
the rough, tough individual who
wants to spend his life in-
vestigating grisly murders in
Boston (and they say Ivy
Leaguers can’t get jobs! ).

Rachel Ward (not a Harvard
graduate) is an exchange stu-
dent at a small girls’ college on
Beacon Hill. How she found this
small girls’ school so far away
from her native England is a
mystery in itself, but why she
only takes night classes there is
totally inexplicable. She is in-
deed English, which explains
why one sentence in every ten
could not be understood by the
audience (in this case, John and
myself).

The plot involves the fact that
girls at Rachel's school are
dropping like flies. About every
ten minutes another coed is
slashed in the neck and her
head is dropped in some sort of

my personal favorite takes
place at a diner. You’ve heard
of Chicken in a Basket? How
about : waitress’ head in beef
stew?

Naturally, one tries to guess
the killer’s identity. The pro-
ducers help out by providing an
abundance of clues so the
average third grader could
work it out. All the victims are
taught by a certain prof. This
prof fools around with all his
students. He is obsessed with
headhunting. Rachel, the pro-
fessor’s room-mate and _ lab
assisstant, accompanied him to
Africa to look at headhunting
tribes. (How she did this while
taking night classes is unex-
plained.) Rachel is carrying the
professor’s child. The head-
hunters in Africa kill only those
who threaten them. I won’t give
the solution to this whodunit, as
only a Harvard man on the
Boston force could get this one.
The film is rated R, so there has
to be some flesh. We see Rachel
taking a shower, and a couple of
other girls undressing. Another
scene shows the school’s head-
mistress in a lesbian affair with
a student. All this may cause a
ten-year-old to breathe heavily.
John and I yawned. A very poor
attempt at exploitation (I have
always wondered, though, why
full-length mirrors always
steam up right at the waist in
these movies...).

Commentary:

A Shot In The Arm

by John Cleghorn

It was a happy W&L bench in
the closing minutes of the vic-
tory over Centre last Saturday
and had any players turned
around, they would have been
surprised to see a full stadium
of fans that were almost as
pleased. The victory gave both
the Generals and the fans a
much needed shot in the arm.
The team on the field Saturday
was a good example of what the
Generals are capable of doing
this season, if they can steer
clear of their past.

Welcome to Lexington Al
Paradise. To an offense that
sputtered in the past games
Paradise was a spark plug that
gave the Generals fine tuning.
Running the option with Chris
Cavalline, Paradise gained as
many yards as the outstanding
tailback and provided a threat
that gave the General offense
an extra aspect. Paradise also
throws the ball with a fine touch
completing 12 of 27.

Tailback Cavalline was also a
cornerstone in Saturday’s win.
Coming off a 156 yard game last
week at Emory & Henry Caval-
line hit holes with the prover-
bial “‘wreckless abandon.’’ Just
when Centre might have him
keyed in the backfield he slip-
ped out for receptions down
field. Eighty yards rushing and
85 receiving is a pretty well

rounded day, not to mention
four punts with an average of
38.5.

You had to love Coach Gary
Fallon’s play calling. On two
big drives he went on fourth and
little. The option, a more open
passing attack, using running
backs as receivers, and fewer
dives make the Generals a
much more entertaining team
to watch.

The two outstanding single
play awards go to Phil Hrabar
and Marty Thomas. Hrabar
committed an arial theft in the
end zone to bring down W&L’s
second touchdown. And nobody
was more surprised than
Thomas when a squibbed kick
drove into his gut five yards off
the line, but he quickly
recovered and returned it 35
yards to set up a field goal.

Before most had left their
bloody mary partys for the
game, the defensive secondary
had gotten burned down the
sideline for Centre’s first score.
But the Generals tightened up
for the remainder of the game
holding strong with starting
linebacker John McKee out tor
much of the game.

The Generals showed their
stuff Saturday and will have
even more where that came
from. Keep it up Generals, you
earned a lot of fans.

Injured Soccer Team Loses

by John Harrison

The Washington & Lee soccer
team lost its first game of the
young season last Saturday
when it dropped a 3-2 decision to
Haverford.

Following the game, head
coach Rolf Piranian made an
announcement that could test
the team’s ability to adjust to
some changes. ‘‘We’ve suffered
a number of injuries lately, so
we will be using more of our
younger players and switching
some of the experienced
players to new positions. The
team we put on the field at
Davidson (Saturday) and here
next Tuesday against Hamp-
den-Sydney will look a lot dif-
ferent than the one we had on
our opening game. Both games
will be a good test for us, as a
result of the adjustments to the
line-up we’ve been forced to
make. Our success now depends
on the players’ adjustments to
their new roles.

Starting time for the Hamp-
den-Sydney game will be 3:30.

The score of the Haverford
game does not indicate how the
Fords dominated play. With the
exception of the situations in
which Roland Simon scored the
Generals’ goals, W&L was un-
able to keep the ball in the
Haverford end of the field for
more than a minute at a time.
Simon started the scoring at
15:00 of the first half when he
beat the diving keeper after a
scramble in the goal mouth. He
went on to score the final goal of
the day with less than two

Ruggers Begin Fall
Season Coachless

by Dan Tatum

Following a .500 season last
year and the departure of their
coach, W&L’s rugby club will
sport several new players and a
new player-coach.

Junior Todd Alexander has
taken the place of last year’s

coach, Larry Babbits. “Babbits

got the team on its feet, but we
shouldn’t miss him too badly,”
said Alexander.

Alexander explained his posi-
tion as player-coach by saying
that rugby is essentially a
player’s game, not a coach’s
game.

The W&L squad started last
year’s season with two tough
losses to U.N.C.-Greensboro
and the Greensboro Rugby Club
and followed with two close
losses to U.N.C.-Chapel Hill and
N.C. State. W&L finished the
season on an upswing, however,
with three victories over the
New River Club, the Cape Fear
Club of Wilmington, and the
Winchester Rugby Club.

The only team in its division
that W&L did not beat was
Hampden-Sydney.

Several of the experienced
players who were injured in the
spring are playing football this
fall, so the club will be starting

several inexperienced players
this season.

W&L’s opening game will be a
week from this Saturday
against U.N.C.-Greensboro.

Polo Team
Goes 7-1

by G. Bruce Potter

The Washington & Lee water
polo team improved its record
to 7-1 while winning the W&L In-
vitational last weekend.

The Generals scored victories
over James Madison (10-1),
Lynchburg (17-2) and the
Northern Virginia Water Polo
Club (11-7). The latter match-up
proved to be a tough test for the
Generals as they rallied from a
5-1 first quarter deficit.

Erik Peterson and Mike Ber-
not paced W&L with 11 and ten
goals, respectively. Goalie, An-
dy Gates made 13 saves and
Kevin Kadesky stopped 11
shots.

W&L opens play in the Slip-
pery Rock tournament tomor-
row and will have a chance to
avenge their 13-5 loss to the
Rockets suffered in the cham-
pionship finale of the Fall
Classic.

Mancer, partially screened on

Pittman

_ Impressive

by Bob Halorin

Freshmen otien rise im-
mediately to the top of a cross
country team, more so than
other iam sports. Of the four
freshr.en on the W&L squad,
Ben Lipscomb, Chris Smith,
Steve Whetzle, and Frank Pitt-
man, perhaps Pittman has the
brightest future.

Frank was captain of his aigh
chool team for three con-
secutive years and, as a junior,
led unein to their first’ Georgia
stat. championship. He placed
firs. in his coun'v three times
and won the regionals tv: ice. In
his three state appearances, he
‘ecorded finishes of fifth, third
and second places.

Frank’s competitive laurels
are not limited to just high
school meets. On the A.A.U.
(Amateur Athletic Union) level,
he placed sixth and second
iwice in the state of Georgia. In
his senior year, as captain of
the A.A.U. team, Frank came in
31xin in the Southeast and 84th
in the Nationals.

It appears that, with
{freshmen runners the caliber of
Frank Pittman, Washington &
Lee's cross country team has
the foundation for successfu,
seasons in the years to come.

Paradise, Cavalline Lead W&L Victory Over Centre

(continued from page 1)

W&L territory, Centre’s drive
stalled. The Colonels tried a 30-
yard field goal only to have the
ball shank off the kicker’s foot
and into the arms of W&L’s
Marty Thomas. The junior de-
fensive back raced to the Centre
38-yard line. Six plays later
junior kicker Bill Devine booted
a 30-yard field goal to narrow
the Colonels’ lead to 14-10.

From this point, the W&L
defense dominated Centre while
the Generals’ offense came
alive.

Paradise, making his second
straight start for the Generals,
led his team in two fourth-
quarter scoring drives.
Paradise himself scored on a
six-yard run early in the final
period, while junior tailback
Chris Cavalline capped the final
W&L scoring drive with a se-
ven-yard scamper in the final
two minutes.

Paradise and Cavalline con-
tinued to be the two big offen-
sive weapons for the Generals.

Paradise not only passed for
127 yards and one touchdown
but led his team in rushing with
81 yards and another score.

“Paradise is still making
some mistakes, but he is pro-

ducing and unless something
drastic happens, he’s our man
at quarterback,”’ said Fallon.

Cavalline followed Paradise
in the ground game with 80
yards and a touchdown and also
led his team in pass-receiving
with a game-high 85 yards.
Cavalline also averaged 40-
yards as the W&L punter.

“I spoke to Centre’s coaches
after the game,’’ offered
Fallon, ‘‘and they had nothing
but praise for Cavalline. They
had geared their defense for his
running game, but they hadn’t
counted on his pass-catching
ability.”

W&L rolled up 330 total yards
on the afternoon while failing to
commit a turnover.

Next Saturday, the Generals
will put their 2-1 record on the
line as they travel to Ashland,
Virginia, to take on ODAC rival
Randolph-Macon.

Last year the Generals lost
14-10 to the Wasps. This year,
maintained Fallon, W&L will
see a virtually new R-M-C team
“because they graduated so
many people. They’ve also had
two weeks to prepare for us, so
they’ll be ready.”’

Game time is 2 p.m. on Day
Field.

Harriers Win Clash Of Washingtons

by Rick Swagler

This past weekend, the an-
nual ‘‘Battle of the Washing-
tons’ took place in Fredericks-
burg, Virginia, at Mary Wash-
ington College. The ‘‘Battle’’ is
a cross-country meet in which
Washington & Lee, Mary
Washington College and
Washington College compete.
This year, Washington & Lee
won with a score of 22 points —
the best possible score is 15.

W&L had six men in the top
ten, and of these six; first, four-
th, and seventh place all went to
freshmen, Sophomore Paul
Chapman, in his first cross-
country meet ever, finished
eighth with a time of 29:42 over
the five mile course. Chapman
says he “‘hopes to improve”’ but
adds that “‘the top five are very
tough.”’

Freshman Frank Pittman,
the overall meet winner, turned
in a surprisingly fast 28:33, just
edging out Angus McBryde, a
sophomore, in second place.
McBryde had a time of 28:34.

Pittman said that he surprised
himself with his performance
and after he took the lead at
about the two mile mark, he
‘ust cruised.”’

Both Chapman and McBryde
were highly complimentary of
the freshmen. Une man to
watch among these freshmen is
Steve Whetzle. In this, his first
collegiate meet, Whetzle finish-
ed an impressive fourth place.
Chapman commented that
Whetzle was extremely tough
mentally, going so far as to
compare him with teammate
Angus McBryde, also known for
his mental toughness.

Coach Dick Miller, when ask-
ed about this Saturday’s meet
against Roanoke College and
Norfolk State, said that his
team is “training for the
Roanoke meet, but we’re look-
ing down the road to the ODAC
Championships.”’ Miller com-
mented that ‘‘this is the most
together team we've had in a
long time and on any given day,
anyone could be the leader.”
Chapman concurred with his

coach’s assessment, saying
“the reason we did so well
Saturday was because we ran in
a pack.”

Two other runners deserving
recognition are Chris Smith, a
freshman, who finished seventh
and is showing promise accord-
ing to his teammates, and John
Kelefant, a junior. At Satur-
day’s meet, Kelefant acquired a
‘stitch’, a pain in the side or
abdomen, which is more of a
nuisance than other injuries.
Kelefant was forced to walk an
entire mile of the five mile
course yet still managed to
finish in tenth place. This finish
surely indicates the type of per-
formance Kelefant is capable of
this weekend. Chapman went so
far as to say, ‘‘I consider Kele-
fant in the top five right now.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Marathon Men

Last Tuesday night, the Executive Committee in-
tended to appropriate funds for all undergraduate and
law school organizations. Unfortunately, several of
the decisions did not evolve until the wee hours of
Wednesday morning. In order to hear each organiza-
tion’s budget request, the EC spent over eight hours in
its chambers listening to volumes of pleas and likely

taking handfuls of No-Doze.

What alarms us is the method in which the EC
heard the budget requests. Rather than spreading the
hearings over a two-day period, the EC decided to do
it in a shotgun-fashion. While the rest of the city was
asleep, the EC made decisions affecting many phases

of student life.

Surprisingly, the EC kept the Student Activities
Board’s budget request — all $57,000 of it — until last.
When the SAB’s turn came, the clock read 2 a.m. and
neither the EC nor the SAB’s representatvies ap-
preared in any shape for a serious discussion.

In the future, the EC would do well to schedule these
hearings over a two-day period. We doubt that a one-
day delay in hearing a budget request will cause any
serious damage. A day’s rest would leave both the EC
and requesting parties in better shape for discussion.

What the EC showed was an impressive display of
stamina. Unfortunately, it was also an unnecessary

and unwise.

The Victors

Congratulations are in order for the WAshington
and Lee football team, victors in last Saturday’s
game against Centre College. The Generafs are 2-1
now and many experts agree that W&L will win the
Old Dominion Athletic Qonference this year.

Saturday’s game was dramatic in that the Generals
overcame a 14-0 deficit ito win. Exciting football is
something new to W&L fans. Hopefully the fans will
show their gratitude by coming out in large numbers

at Wilson Field.

| “There is a close community

| Unity stems from the tradi-
_ tions and the lack of off campus
housing. ‘We are residential in
the full sense... whereas at W&L

you live all over the city.”
“With the close community
and the option of living alone in
the senior year, I think the

students find it a healthy at-

mosphere.

“There are studies to show

that the single-sex institutions
have a longer-lasting positive
effect on the students.’ He
noted the late sixties report of
Alexander Astin.

‘Astin thought at a single-sex |
school there is more getting to |
know the faculty.”’

Randolph-Macon Woman’s
College is a small college with a
high caliber cultural program,
a curriculum lacking in crib
courses, and a friendliness that |
minks might well emulate.

 

 

   
 

THE Rn YouR oF
THiS REARING, WE
TURN TQ ITEM
ON TRE BUDGE T,.. :

Cooperation

Is: Urged

Dear Sir:

The incident of the tire theft
that you referred to in your
“Security” editorial took place
on Oct. 15, 1980, almost one year
ago and as a result, additional
watchmen were hired.

You are correct in your state-
ment that a zero crime rate is
unlikely. However, with the
cooperation of the students, I
think the crime rate will be
drastically reduced this year. If
something is stolen from a stu-
dent’s car he should notify Mr. °
Murray (ext. 153) or myself
(ext. 211) as soon as possible. If
we are not in, leave a number
with the secretary where you
can be reached so we can get in-
formation. The sooner we can
get to work on something, the
likelier we are to get results.

If students own cassette
players, boosters or CB’s, they
should purchase anti-theft lock-
ing devices which are available
for about $2 at local automotive
stores. They are easy to install
and are a good investment to
protect one’s property. All
automobiles should be locked if
they’re left anywhere on cam-
pus overnight. Locking gas caps
are also a good idea.

Should any student see
anything suspicious at any time
in the parking lots, he should
call 463-9111, ext. 198 and ex-
plain that he needs a watchman
at such-and-such a place. If the
response is not satisfactory, tell
me about it and you’ll get a bet-
ter response in the future, I pro-
mise. After midnight, dial
463-9118.

If we all work together on
this, I’m certain the situation
will improve.

Sincerely,
Burr Datz
Assistant Proctor

EC Sits Through Eight Hours Of Budget Hearings

continued from page 1
past, the SAB will hire three big
acts.

Three percent of the budget
went to organizations never
before funded through the E.C.:
the Outing Club, the Washing-
ton and Lee Review, Inter-
Varsity Christian Fellowship,
and the Computer Club.

After discussing at length the
durability of sleeping bags, the
E.C. trimmed the Outing Club
request to $1500 from almost
twice that amount.

The university funded this
backpacking-canoeing club last
year, but will not this year, ac-
cording to Bob Farsythe, club
leader.

Law student Eric Anderson
presented a request for student
body funds for a political jour-
nal he hopes to see inaugurated
this year.

Such a review would be non-
partisan and open to scholar-
ship from students, faculty and
alumni. Anderson would like to
publish the twenty page tabloid
in February to assure plenty of
time for editing.

The E.C. was interested in the
Review as a way of unifying the
law campus and the undergrad-
uates. Six hundred dollars was
suggested as the likely E.C.
allocation.

Like the Outing Club, Inter-
Varsity is not a new group. This
is, however, the first year it has
applied for student body funds.
The E.C. set $400 as a ten-

tative allocation.

Law Representative Morgan
Griffith noted that the prece-
dent had been set to likewise
fund other religious groups, be
they Jewish, Buddhist or
atheist.

Lee Feldman of the Computer
Club presented a request for
$3,500. The figure included the
cost of an Infoton computer ter-
minal, an IBM selectric type-
writer, and magnetic tapes, all
one-time expenses.

“They will be involved
around the state representing
W&L, they will help with our
swim tournaments, they’ll be
helping students,’’ argued
resentative John Vlahoplus.
“T’ve seen how terrible a job the
university has done with the
computer center.”

“IT don’t think there’s an anti-
computer prejudice on the com-
mittee,’ said Vice President
Jim Averett. Although the E.C.
finally allocated only $200 for
the club, Averett and others
promised support to Feldman.

“Purchase of the selectric
and the ‘Infotrash”’ is a capital-
upgrading project that the Uni-
versity is really responsible
for,” said Vlahoplus.

Two sports clubs, rugby and
fencing, were allocated about
$600 each. Although the Rugby
Club budget contained confus-
ing expenditures such as
scrumsleds and dozens of
oranges, the E.C. was so pleas-
ed to have a well-documented

budget request from the rug-

gers that it allocated the exact
amount requested.

President Myers called it a
“tight”? budget, and pointed out
that transportation costs were
absorbed by the players them-
selves. Club dues are collected
and spent on the traditional
post-game parties.

Rugby bookeeper Todd Alex-
ander conceded that the books
had been mismanaged last
year.

University Counselor James
Worth spoke for the Fencing
Club as coach. His request was
cut to $600 from $690 because
the E.C. felt it could not spend
student funds on a team ban-
quet.

Representative Bent-
talewarned that the allocation
might have to be cut before the
final approval of the budget
next week.

Worth cited cooperation from
Athletics Chairman William
McHenry and other university
coaches. One reason for the
club not becoming a varsity
sport is the lack of someone to
take over as coach should
Worth move on.

The Film Society was allo-
cated $1125, $300 less than it had
requested.

The E.C. questioned the $200
spent in projectionist fees. The
Film Society representative
replied that to use the Law
school for the showings, it was
necessary to hire Law student
projectionists.

Myers believed that the SAB
had used the Law _ School
theater without hiring their pro-
jectionists, who he suspected
were work-study students
already paid by the government
through the school.

‘Furthermore, I don’t see
why W&L students ought to pay
to use their own facilities,”’ said
Myers.

Contact was allocated $9000,
with an unwritten challenge to
the Inter Fraternity Council to
contribute $8000, in which case
another $1000 may come later
from E.C. coffers.

“T think that Contact has the
greatest potential of all the
committees on the (list),”’
stated Ross.

‘T would rather see the Calyx
cut than the Speakers Program
cut. I would rather see the Phi
cu’ to improve Contact,’’ said
Hale.

Contact is also funded by the
IFC, which started the organ-
ization to contribute to the
university’s cultural life, accor-
ding to Myers. The IFC usually
matches the E.C. allocation,
although Averett warned that
the IFC might not be able to this
year.

A theme of Law School under-
graduate reconciliation coursed

the discussion of funding for the
Student Bar Association, the
Ring-tum Phi, the Ariel, and the
Calyx.

The Student Bar was allo-

cated all of the $15,825 that it re-
quested. This figure represents
17 percent of the evening’s
allocations.

Hale suggested that for
economic purposes the Law
News and the Ring-tum Phi be
merged. Law student Tom
Garen replied that there would
not be significant participation
from the Law students to make
the merger useful.

Andrew Trotter of the Ariel
was allocated $2150. Committee
members discussed advertising
in this literary magazine, as
well as scholarship from the
surrounding universities, but no
recommendations were made.

Scott Fitzgerald gave an in-
tricate presentation of the state
of the Calyx. Editor Jack Huskin
explained that the contract with
the publisher had been drawn
and it was too late to combine
his with the Law School year-
book. They received $11,000.

Trent Dickerson of the Ring-
tum Phi presented a budget re-
quest lower than last year’s.The
request was accepted as it stood
at $10,180. Editor Bill Whalen
spoke against a merger of the
Phi and the Law News.

Ariel, Calyx and = Phi
allocations acount for one
quarter of the tentative budget.

The International Club was
granted $150. The Mock Conven-
tion asked for and received
nothing, except the use of the
E.C. account at the Printing Of-
fice.

Would you care to respond to criticism in last

| week's paper for conducting budget hearings into the
| wee hours of one night?

Well, I think that from the stand-point that peo-

| ple on the committee as well the subcommittee
| representatives would be more rested, possibly

more awake from that standpoint it’s possible that
it may have been better to have it on two nights.
But from the stand-point of the Executive Com-
mittee, in the past we've done it in one night to
preserve a lot of the continuity of thought which
goes into the budget hearings. Working with a cer-
tain pool of money and having all requests done in
one night preserves the flow by which committee
members take in the information and disseminate
it. Ithink that outweighs the possibility that people
will get tired and blow it off. I think that all the
committee members, even though it might be late,
try to maintain their composure and take that into
account — that they are getting tired and that
these requests are being made and the later ones
should be considered just as important as the in-
| itialo ones.

Regarding budget considerations, do you have a
general idea of how funds should be allocated before
the hearings or do you base your decision on in-
dividual needs as presented by the various subcom-
mittees?

Well, we base our decisions on a number of fac-
tors; one would be a committee’s past perfor-
mance and past allocation. We feel that if a com-
mittee has done a certain job up to this point and
established a record of success they should be
allotted at least the same amount, if it’s possible to
do that, as in the past. Another factor is that we try
to encourage as many new clubs as we can by
allotting them funds to start up. We try to weigh
the interest of the established clubs against the re-
quest of new and upcoming clubs, such as the
outing club and the computing machinery club.
Clubs like that look to the E.C. for really their first
breath of life.

Do you think last year’s White Book revisions will
enable you to conduct honor trials more effectively
than previous committees?

Pruning only a $400 allocation
for a Christian group, the Ex-
ecutive Committee ratified its
final budget for the school year
at a Tuesday night meeting.

The budget distributes $98,950
in student body funds to thirteen
student organizations, and to
E.C. accounts.

Debate on the preliminary
allocation to the Inter-Varsity
Christian Fellowship lasted
almost 90 minutes. President
Frank Williams of IVCF attend-
ed with eight of the group’s
leaders. Jon Pakula and Bill Ar-
cher brought Dr. David R.
Novack of the sociology depart-

ment and four ot.iers to protest
the funding of the Christian
group.

Pakula presented a petition of
110 signatures challenging the
use of student body funds by
any religious group.

‘We just don’t believe,”
stated Pakula, ‘‘in the student
funding of a group whose
religious orientation may be
counter to that of some
members of the student body.”’

Williams argued that no mat-
ter what goals an organization
had, someone would object to it.
Gary Carneal claimed that
IVCF had a right to student
funds because it represented a

blems between fraternities and

Police Cas Myeteriously Crashes

by Tom Baker

A Lexington patrol officer’s
car was mysteriously moved
and wrecked while he was in-
vestigating the Sigma Nu house
for a noise violation last Satur-
day night.

Patrolman Torben Pedersen
had entered the Sigma Nu house
around 1 a.m. to close down a
band for playing too loud.

“I had put the car in park,
removed the key from the igni-
tion, put the key in my pocket
and left it unlocked; which is
normal procedure,”’ said Peder-

n. “I went inside the frater-
nity to shut down the band and
returned five minutes later,’’ he
continued ‘‘and found the car

smashed against the war

memorial (at the Washington

and Lee University gates ).”’
According to Pedersen, the

 

car can -_ be shifted out of
park when the key is in the igni-
tion switch. Pedersen said the
car’s gear lever was still in the
“‘park’’ position when he found

it. Pedersen said the ‘car had
rolled down Henry St. and was
blocking traffic on Jefferson
Ave.

Pedersen did not think that
students at the party were in-
volved but theorized that the
cruiser may have rolled out of
gear by itself. The cruiser is
made by Ford, which has had
trouble with this model’s
transmissions. Damage to the
automobile was estimated at

$1000.
In other police matters,
Sigma Chi, Pi Kappa Alpha,

Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Phi
Kappa Sigma, each were cited
for violations of the city’s noise
ordinance.

The proposal, which will be
presented to the Lexington City
Council, was drafted by an IFC
subcommittee composed of
several fraternity presidents.
The subcommittee was chaired
by John McIntyre.

The two-part proposal re-
quests the Lexington Police
Department to give W&L fra-
ternities a warning before clos-
ing down a party for noise viola-
tions. The IFC also requested
that amplified music be permit-
ted up tola.m.

In return for these conces-
sions, fraternities would make a
greater effort to clean up the
outsides of houses following
parties. The IFC also voted to
hire a person to clean up litter
left on public property when
party-goers migrate from one
house to another. The last
measure would not be im-

plemented until next year,
however.
In other business, McIntvre

ing presence of uninvited VMI

Morgan Griffith, senior law
representative, said he regret-

that he thought religion was too

Archer said that although this

REVIEW aad OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Lions 4.00
Christians 0

‘Just exactly what is your criteria for funding stu-
dent organizations?’ asked the president of the Inter-
Varsity Christian Fellowship at Tuesday’s Executive
Committee meeting.

It seems the E.C. criteria does not include funding a

religious group, as the tentative $400 allocation to

IVCF was revoked (see page one).

The criteria excludes sleeping bags, picnics and In-
foton computer terminals. The criteria includes
oranges, scrum sleds and porno weekends. If there
are no solid criteria to form an E.C. funding policy,
the lack of criteria can form a policy. It is a policy of
neglecting the minority.

As Secretary Pennett Ross put it, the E.C. has
grossly neglected students outside the mainstream.
Such negligence promotes conformity.

One group of students don’t enjoy foreign films, G.
Gordon Liddy or SAB entertainment. How will the
E.C. give each of these people their 55 dollars’ worth
($55 is the amount of student tax paid with tuition) ?

Funds for the IVCF would have paid for speakers
for all to hear, films for all to see, and conferences for
all to attend. The Christian group would have con-
tinued to pay for its non-alcohol theme parties. It
would not have been reimbursed as a counseling
center for freshmen and foreign exchange students.

The E.C. tries to encourage new clubs by funding
them, said President Eric Myers in a Ring-tum Phi
interview. If the E.C. wanted to promote alternatives
to the SAB-frat scene, it would wait for the coming of
a group that filled the prescription . The Independent
Union came by several years ago, but without student
support it died. Now Inter-Varsity comes along, with
a constituency, an alternative, the admiration of even
its budget-foes, a record of service and a stable
future, and the E.C. ‘‘nukes’”’ it as a bad precedent.

Because the precedent of toying with the constitu-
tion was dangerous, law students must wait ten weeks
before their freshman representative is elected.
Because the precedent of supporting religion with stu-
dent funds is dangerous, a significant number of
students will not get their money’s worth from the

‘The IFC Offer

The proposal developed at Tuesday night’s session
of the Interfraternity Council offers the city of Lex-
ington an opportunity to prove its sincerity in claim-
ing to be a friend of the fraternity system. The IFC’s
proposal is not a headstrong demand. It is a com-
promise — nothing more and nothing less.

In the true diplomatic sense, one hand will wash the
other in this offer. Fraternities will, in theory, keep
their partying cleaner if the police department agrees
to be less Entebbe-like in its enforcement of city noise
ordinances.

One flaw in the IFC’s offer may be the request to ex-
‘end the deadline for amplified music to 1 a.m. Will
‘he city agree to a compromise when the compromise
is an extension of the fraternities’ privilege to make
noise?

We see this offer as an indication of the city’s opi-
nion of the W&L fraternity system. If the proposal
goes through, we may see a new era of cooperation
between the community and fraternities. If it fails, we
face a return to the senseless hostility and tension be-
tween the two parties.

Dear Sir:

I've noticed in your latest
issues of the Ring-tum Phi that
the cross-country team has
received good coverage, which
is good to see. But I’ve also
noticed that there has not been
one mention of the new assis-
tant cross-country coach —Paul
Thompson.

Paul is a second-year law stu-
dent here at W&L and a 1977
graduate of the University. He
still holds the W&L record in the
mile: 4:15. He has been working
out with the team, supporting
them, going to the meets and is
really the power behind the
team’s fantastic improvement.

Incidentally, Paul is helping
out on a volunteer basis. With-
out taking anything away from
coach Dick Miller, I hope that in
the next article Paul can be
mentioned — he really deserves
it. Ask anyone on the team.

Thank you very much

Political Magazine Started

by B. Scott Tilley

New to Washington and Lee
students this year will be the
publication of a new magazine,
“The W&L Review.” The brain-
child of two third-year law
students, Eric Anderson and
David Black, the magazine’s
purpose is to provide W&L
students with a commentary on
political current events and
theory.

“We felt W&L was an ex-
cellent campus for something of
this nature,’ said Anderson,
‘‘because the student body is so
politically active. The under-
graduates tend to be very con-
servative, perhaps one of the
most conservative Campuses in
the country, and the law
students tend to be liberal; so

we should have a_ broad
perspective of views.”

The “Review” will be con-
cerned with national topics,
though some state, local, and
school topics may be discussed.
The depth of current events will
depend on the publication date,
tentatively scheduled for late
February.

Besides basic decisions that
have yet to be made, the
primary problem is money.
“We anticipate a budget of
$1150,’ explained Anderson.
“The Executive Committee has
tentatively allocated us $600,
and we expect $200 in advertis-
ing. We are currently looking
around for other sources. We
are hoping to be allocated some
more by the E.C.”’

Dartmouth and Brown cur-
rently publish similar reviews,
added Anderson. ‘‘They publish
every couple of weeks, but are
only four pages in length. We

hope through one big issue we,

can print in-depth stories that
are well-researched, not short,
trite ones,”’ he explained.

The review is open to all
undergraduate and law stu-
dents. There will be an
organizational meeting for all
interested students Wednesday,
October 14 at 8 p.m. in room 114
of the Student Center.

Anderson concluded that “‘if
interests this year are up for the
idea, we hope it can be publish-
ed more frequently in years to
come.”

“I think his point is well-

what I have heard from
students in recent years, W&L
does not provide alternatives to
students who choose not to go
the fraternity route.”

“I think that student body

The E.C. did not seek to tell
IVCF what to do, said Junior-
Representative John Vlahoplus,
but should they change their
name and continue to offer
counseling, speakers, and an
alternative program of enter-
tainment, they could reapply
later for E.C. funding.

EC Seeks Revision
Of Constitution

by Todd Smith

The Executive Committee
discussed ways to amend and
revise its outdated constitution
at Monday night’s meeting.

Last year, the committee’s
amendments were approved
by students on several occas-
sions. However, in none of the
referendums did a majority of
students cast ballots, so the
amendments failed.

Secretary Bennett Ross sug-
gested that the ballots for a-
mendments be connected to the
ballots for freshman and first
year law student elections, so
that freshmen and law students
would be casting a ballot for the
amendments if they voted in
the election even if they did not
vote on the constitution.

Suggestions that polls be
located in the dining hall and on
Main Street and Junior Repre-
sentative Frank Smith’s idea
that every student be forced to
cast a vote, were all dismissed
as unconstitutional.

“Last year I voted to change
the constitution without student
approval,’’ said President Eric
Myers, “‘but-when you do that, it
snowballs. Then the constitu-
tion becomes meaningless;
then everything we do becomes
meaningless, and what you get
is a power vacuum.”

Myers pledged to try to en-
courage students to vote for the
changes, and exorted other
committee members to do

likewise.

Ten Professors Take Leaves

Ten Washington & Lee
University faculty members
are on leaves of absence this
fall and are undertaking
research projects ranging from
a study of geomorphic pro-
cesses to an examination of
alternative Christian  ap-
proaches to economic justice.

Three faculty members are
pursuing their research abroad
during the fall term: Edwin D.
Craun, associate professor of
English, is carrying out
research on Medieval and
Renaissance narrative tragedy
at the University of Oxford; L.
Randlett Emmons, professor of
biology, is at the University of
Basel in Switzerland; studying
immunogenetics; and, Emory
Kimbrough Jr., professor of
sociology, is at Chung Chi Col-
lege in Hong Kong where he is
involved in research on the ex-
tent to which the writings of
Charles Darwin have influenc-
ed sociological perspective.

Thomas P. Burr, Esq.,
Wessex Regional Officer of the
English National Trust, will lec-
ture on Stourhead, the 18th cen-
tury garden of which he has
special charge, on Tuesday at 8
p.m. in Washington & Lee Uni-
versity’s duPont Auditorium.

Burr’s illustrated lecture,
‘‘Stourhead — The Creation of
the English Landscape
Garden,”’ is the first in W&L’s

said Mrs. Mason, ‘‘but he either
cut the strap or it broke.”’

Mrs. Mason said she fought
back, but the assailant knocked
her on the sidewalk and then
ran off with the purse. Mrs.
Mason said she received a head
injury ‘either when I fell or he
hit me. I’m not sure.”’

The assailant ran through the
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity
yard as Mrs. Mason chased
him, but she lost him on
McDowell St.

Lexington police are now in-
vestigating the incident.

‘Endless Film’

by Todd Jones

I'm sure that many students
here at W&L are occasionally
discouraged by the fact that this
is an all-male school.
Sometimes having women only
on Wednesdays and the week-
ends does not seem sufficient. If
you are ever wallowing in self-
pity about the lack of female
companionship, go see Endless
Love. Endless Love will make
you happy if you see a woman
once every month

David Axelrod will not be see-
ing his girlfriend Jade for a lit-
tle while. He spent two years in
a mental institution only to see
her once and then go to prison.
Not a happy life for someone in
love as much as Dave is. The
movie ends giving you a feeling
of utter depression, not only
because Dave is in such a bad
state, but also because you
spent three dollars that could
have been spent much more

wisely on, say, an_ electric
potato peeler.
Endless Love has_ been

nicknamed Endless Movie for
good reason. The plot goes on,
and on, and on. I can think of
about four places that the movie
should have ended, but didn’t.
Part of the problem is that the
movie’s plot is a tad unbeliev-
able. In an early scene, Jade’s
father tells Dave that he is not
to come over to their house for a
month. If you were Dave, what
would you do? Probably sneak
off and meet somewhere else.
What does Dave do? He sets fire
to Jade’s house. Really natural,
right? Later, Jade’s father sees
Dave in New York. He decides
to chase him but forgets that
there is a taxi going 60 miles an

hour directly in front of him.
Needless to say, the father hits
the road, literally. Such in-
cidents as these make the
movie quite hard to swallow.

Brooke Shields plays Jade,
the girl Dave, played by Martin
Hewitt, is in love with. Brooke
plays her part well, mainly by
smiling and showing us all why
Dave has good reason to love
her. Her part is actually sur-
prisingly small, however, com-
pared to Hewitt’s role.

Hewitt is good in his role, but
really lacks the excellence that
is demanded for the complexity
of his part. The whole movie
centers around Dave's obses-
sion with Jade. Hewitt does his
best, but the part just seems to
be too big for him.

The movie is not without good
characters or high points.
Jade’s mother, played by Shir-
ley Knight, is very enjoyable.
Her characterization of a liber-
al-minded mother is done so
that she borders on eccentric,
yet remains very believable.
The viewer understands that
the love she sees between David
and Jade is the love that she has
never experienced with her hus-
band. In her last line in the
movie, she tells her daughter
that she deserves everything.
We realize that actually the
mother is the one that deserves
everything, but apparently will
never get it.

Richard Kiley, who plays
David's father, puts in a good
performance. He is a lawyer
who has spent too much time
with his clients and not enough
time with his son. In what I
think is the best scene in the
movie, he talks with his son

   

CONCERT

 
    
 
 
  
    
    
    
    

after Dave has just been releas-
ed from the mental institution.
He explains that he understands
what Dave must feel, for he
himself is undergoing the same
feeling. He informs Dave that
he is separated from Dave’s
mother and that he is in love
with someone else. He tells
Dave that although the first
love is very special, one has to
go beyond it and experience
life.

The movie is directed by
Franco Zeferelli. Zeferelli
chose to film all of the love-
making scenes between Jade
and David in either red or blue
gels. Why he does this I don’t
quite understand, unless it is to
demonstrate the dream-like
quality of the love that the two
are experiencing. The film also
is edited badly, and sometimes
lacks cohesion.

Endless Love is a movie that
simply doesn’t make it. This is
not due to poor acting. The
movie lost out because of a poor
script which could not come toa
sufficient stopping place. None-
theless, I could feel a certain
electricity between Hewitt and
Shields, a sort of believable
feeling of love. I think it is possi-
ble that they could team up
together again with excellent
results. However, that movie
would have to have a better
script, and better direction,
than Endless Love.

Classic Japanese Films Shown

by Carren O. Kaston

A rare opportunity to learn
more about Japanese life and
culture will become available to
Lexington residents this fall
when Washington & Lee Univer-
sity launches a series of five
Japanese feature films, begin-
ning on Monday, October 12.
The movies will be shown free
of charge on consecutive Mon-
days at 8 p.m., to enable all in-
terested members of the school
and local communities to at-
tend.

The films are being made
available through the generosi-

ty of The Japan Foundation.
They are based on major twen-
tieth century Japanese novels,
and will be shown in conjunc-
tion with Comparative Liter-
ature 221, ‘‘Japanese Literature
in Translation.’’ This is a course
taught jointly by Professors
Minor Rogers of the Religion
Department and John Evans of
the English Department. Pro-
fessor Carren Kaston of the
English Department has agreed
to share in the presentation of
the series because of her long-
standing interest in film.

The series begins on October

12 with The Heart (122
minutes), directed by Kon
Ichikawa in 1955. The movie is
based on Kokoro, a novel writ-
ten in 1914 by Natsume Soseki,
perhaps the greatest novelist of
Japan’s modern _ period.
Soseki’s subject is the impact
on the moral consciousness of
the Japanese of their transfor-
mation into a modern state and
society.

The movie is set at the end of
the Meiji era, the period of
Emperor Meiji’s” reign

(1868-1912), when Japan under-
went rapid modernization. An

intellectual named ‘‘Sensei”’
(teacher), who is seen through
the eyes of a young student,
finds himself alienated from
both traditional and modern
Japanese values. Through him,
Soseki presses his own am-
bivalent grief at the close of the
Meiji era, his feeling that
something irreplaceabie and
uniquely Japanese has been lost
in the process of modernization.
Soseki wrote Kokoro two years
after the death of the Emperor
Meiji, and two years before his
own death in 1916.

As in his other works, Soseki
is concerned in Kokoro with in-
dividualism and loneliness, a
theme which, before Soseki,
was not considered worthy of
attention among the Japanese,
whose society emphasizes com-
munal values. The intellectual
Sensei tries but fails to justify
his egoism in the face of tradi-
tional values. It has been said
that the best translation of the
Japanese word ‘‘kokoro”’ is that
of the Westerner Lafcadio
Hearn, who went to live in
Japan and became an inter-
preter of Japanese culture. His
translation is “the heart of
things.”

The director of The Heart,
Kon Ichikawa, is noted for his

‘superb sense of visual texture

and his concern with spiritually
abnormal behavior that charac-
terizes the social environment
of his protagonists. He is best
known in the West for the
luminous Harp of Burma
(1956); Conflagration (1958),
which will be shown fourth in
this series; and Fires on the
Plain (1959).

The second movie, scheduled
for October 19, is Okoto and
Sasuke (106 minutes), directed
in 1935 by Yasujiro Shimazu. It
is based on the Junichiro
Tanizaki novel Shunkinsho,
published in 1933.

The third movie, which is set
for October 26, is The Sound of
the Mountain (96 minutes),
1954 by Mikio
Naruse. Naruse’s movie is bas-
ed on the Yasunari Kawabata

_ novel Yama No Oto, published

in 1949.

Conflagration (96 minutes),
the fourth film, scheduled for
November 2, was directed by
Kon Ichikawa in 1958. It is bas-
ed on Yukio Mishima’s 1956
novel Kinkakuji (The Temple of
the Golden Pavilion).

The last film of the series will
be Hiroshi Teshigahara’s
Woman in the Dunes (150
minutes), scheduled for
November 9. This 1964 movie is
based on Kobo Abe’s 1962 novel
Suna No Onna.

Screenings will take place in
Lewis Hall “‘A,”’ with the excep-
tion of the screening of
Conflagration, which will take
place in duPont Hall. All of the
films are in the original
language with English sub-
titles. The novels on which these
films are based are available in
English translation.

“Japanese Literature in
Translation,”’ the course in con-

junction with which these films ,

will be shown, draws on Pro-
fessor Rogers’ commitment to
Japanese civilization, a par-
ticular, and Professor Evans’
commitment to literature, a
universal. Professor Rogers
first went to Japan when he was
in the army during the Korean
War. He subsequently spent
four years there as a mis-
sionary. Professor Evans’ in-
terest in Japan goes back to an
early enthusiasm for Japanese
porcelains and _ wood-block
prints. After Professor Evans

began to teach at Washington &
Lee, his interest was strength-
ened and broadened by his con-
tact with Professor Rogers.

Washington & Lee has been
selected by The Japan Founda-
tion as one of five schools to par-
ticipate in the program ‘“‘Twen-
tieth Century Japanese Liter-
ature Through Film.’ The other
participating schools are
Florida State University at Tal-
lahassee, Old Dominion Univer-
sity in Norfolk, University of
Tennessee at Knoxville, and
Purdue University at West
Lafayette, Indiana. The Japan
Foundation is a_ non-profit

Writing
Clinic
Offered

The English department has
announced the establishment of
a writing clinic, intended to help
any undergraduate whose writ-
ing seems deficient. The clinic
will be located in Payne 2B and
will be open from 7 until 10
o'clock each Tuesday and
Thursday night of the fall and
winter terms,

A senior English major will
be present to go over papers
that have been marked and re-
turned to students and to offer
help for improvement. He will
be prepared also to assist in the
preparation of papers not yet
submitted if the professors
assigning them have made
clear that such assistance is
permissible without violating
the Honor System.

The English department
regards the program as ex-
perimental and won't try to
predict what demand there will
be for it or what success it may
have. But if the clinic seems to
serve a useful purpose the de-
partment will attempt to con-
tinue it, and therefore it invites
you to send to it any student
whom you think it might help.

Weekend
Kickoff

by Bill Edmisten

A hard-driving rock n’ roll
band and thirty kegs of beer wil!
ignite the 1981 W&L Homecom-
ing celebrations at 9 p.m
tonight at Zollman’s Pavilion.

The band is Johnny Sportcoat
and the Casuals, a Charlottes-
ville-based group that features
a repertoire of rock, rhythm
and blues, and boogie music.
The rock selections span two
decades from the Beatles and
Yardbirds to the Grateful Dead,
Tom Petty and Elvis Costello.

The turn-out at the Pavilion is
expected to be large because
of extensive publicity and ad-
vance planning. Tom Gearen,
president of the Student Bar
Association, said that signs
have been posted at all of the
surrounding woman’s colleges,
and that he called the schools
several weeks ago in order to
minimize conflicts with other
events.

“This is the law school’s con-
tribution to Homecoming,”’ said
Gearen, referring to the plan-
ning and financing of the event
by the third year class. The Stu-
dent Activities Board nego-
tiated the contract with the
band, which is costing $900
Tickets will be required for ad-
mission and may be purchased
in advance through fraternities
or bought at the gate.

Myers Interview

(continued from page 1)

I think so. Besides the fact that it is amuch more
compact and concise document, without redun-
dancy found in the old book, there are certain
changes which allow the committee more freedom
and less fear of doing something illegal. For ex-
ample, changing the clause which says that the
statement read to the witnesses and to the accused
prior to their testimony, has to adhere to a sug-
gested format. In the old book it said that you
stated this. in quotes, to the witness. There was a
lot of fear that, gee, if we deviated from one word,
the entire proceeding is null and void. In trying to
revise the book, we tried to avoid the legalisms
which we thought permiated the old White Book,
because we're not a legal court and we have never
presumed to be a body or authority on law. This is
an honor system, not a legal system, and as such, I
think the new book has freed us of the fear of hav-
ing to face a legal system.

Do you have any specific goals for the E.C. or for
yourself as president for this school year?

I have a personal goal of trying to revise the con-
stitution, which I think is a must. It was a must
last year for Bob (Willis '81, last year’s president),
but it must be changed because student govern-
ment is clearly limited right now by a constitution

 

you. Having worked with and observed Willis in the
past, are there other ways in which you plan to follow
his example?

Bob has always been a very close friend of mine,
and in some ways he has served as a role model. I
think one way in which I'll differ from the way Bob
and his committee ran things is I want individual
committee members to play a larger role in per-
forming the E.C.’s duties. I felt that last year, Bob
took a lot on himself and sometimes really took the
committee for granted. That's not a fault, it’s just
the way that things were run in the past. Even the
letterhead on our Executive Committee belies the
attitude I have about how duties will be shared by
the committee members. We're all three up front;
there’s no vertical heirarchy. I want to depend on
Bennett (Ross, secretary) and Jim (Averett, vice
president) to help me out a lot this year; and I ex-
pect the ad hoc members to subcommittees to
keep on top of things. If this can all be accomplish-
ed I think that I can personally do more of what I
want to do, which is to go out and talk to people
and find out what people want and what they’re up
to; and to serve as kind of a liason between the
faculty and the students, and other students and
other students.

I think I’d like to decentralize things a little
more, is what I'd like to do.

“Last year there was a feeling that law students

didn’t want any interaction with undergraduates...

This year I’ve seen a different attitude on both sides...”

 

which is no longer in touch with what's going on. It
becomes increasingly difficult to conduct day-to-
day business with a document that, for instance,
was drawn up at a time when undergraduate and
law calendars were concurrent. At this point they
are no longer concurrent, and there are changes
which are needed due to the inflexibility of the old
document. We now have to cope with issues like
representation of law students, and other things
such as the treasurer, which we don’t have. The
treasurer’s Clause is not very useful to us. Revis-
ing the constitution is a topic which we’ll be ad-
dressing at length very soon.

Other goals of mine include trying to at least
socially unify law students and undergraduates.
Last year there was a feeling that law students
didn’t want any interaction with undergraduates,
and vice-versa. This year I’ve seen a different at-
titude on both sides, and I'd like to increase in-
teraction between the two groups.

Bob Willis was extremely interested in at least
establishing a dialogue with the two campuses, and
this is apparently an issue of particular concern to

Another question | had was if you expected E.C.
members to play a more active role in’ student
organizations this year.

Well, the whole idea behind having ad hoc
members to subcommittees is to have in effect our
own observers to find out what our subcommittees
are doing and how they’re doing it. Obviously if we
allocate the money and have control over the com-
mittees as per the constitution, then we should
know what’s going on, because these are student
body funds that are being spent. I think ad hoc
members will play a larger role this year than
they have in the past.

Does your job take up an inordinate amount of your
time, or is it about what you expected it to be?

Well, the actual work done in committee
meetings is about what I expected it to be. An
awful lot of time is taken up conferring with ad-
ministrators or faculty members who have ques-
tions, or just working around the office and keep-
ing up with things. I would have to say that it’s
about what I expected, which is a hell of a lot.

 

DOWN

Mary Baldwin College
Staunton, Va.

In assessing the strengths and
weaknesses of Mary Baldwin
College, here are a few facts.

For economical dating, Bald-
win takes a back seat only to
Southern Sem. Staunton is all of
a 30-mile drive from Lexington
— and a straight drive at that.
This makes getting to Baldwin
quick and uncomplicated,
though the ride back is inter-

| minably boring. Also, Staunton

plays guest host to the nearest
McDonald’s.

Unfortunately, there are
some negative aspects that
must be brought up.

The ride to Baldwin is simple,
but the ascent into the campus
parking lot, especially if one is
alcohol-induced and the roads
are icy, is not unlike scaling the
Matterhorn. The campus itself
is rather spread-out and some
of the buildings are unmarked.

As you will find at all girls’
schools, getting into the dorms
invokes hairy eye-balls and
bureaucratic red tape. The
dorms themselves are rather
nicely furnished. Baldwin is the

one can walk from one dorm to
another on heated sidewalks.

 

The heater’s effectiveness is
| debatable.

only school we know of where ~

THE ROAD:
Ever-Close Baldwin

Security itself is rather lax
compared to Sweet Briar or
Randolph-Macon. Staunton
police tend to place an em-
phasis on parking tickets and
beer smugglers. Campus secur-
ity is about the friendliest we
know. They’ll even shag on re-
quest.

Campus parties are centered
in the Student Activities Center,
also known as the Armory.

Minks beware.

The average Baldwin girl has
more than a fair chance to snag
an eligible male, as the school is
known to associate with both
VMI and that school in Charlot-
tesville. Sydney boys are also
known to make the trek to
Staunton.

Baldwin also gives minks a
wide scope of females. You'll
find the normal amount of
prepettes, along with a few
Joan Baez holdovers and others
who prefer to shag in female-
only groups.

The school itself does not en- |
joy 24-hour visitation rights due |
to a Staunton ordinance that |
would classify the school as a
red-light district if men could
come and go as they pleased.

All said, Baldwin is your
basic spur-of-the-moment road
trip for minks down Rte. 81. If
all fails, the Golden Arches are

only a few blocks away. |

Slippery Rock Proves Tricky For H2O Polo Team

Tim Rock battles past a Slippery Rock defender in their en-

counter on Saturday.

 

by G. Bruce Potter
The Washington & Lee water
polo Generals scored four wins
in the Slippery Rock tourna-

ment last weekend. Their fifth
game, however, was against

their nemesis, the host Rockets.

If you recall, Slippery Rock
downed the Generals two weeks
ago at the Fall Revue Classic,
13-5. It was closer this time,
however, as Slippery Rock held
on for a 10-8 victory and the
tournament title.

‘“‘We’ve improved more than
they (Slippery Rock) have in
two weeks. We felt good about
that loss, if you can feel good
about a loss,”’ said W&L coach
Page Remillard.

Slippery Rock took a four goal
lead into the locker room at
halftime but the Generals, now

13-10 Loss Drops Generals To 2-2

by Dale Park

Like a repeat performance of
last year’s 14-10 loss, the Wash-
ington & Lee football team
dropped a 13-10 decision to
ODAC rival Randolph-Macon
College on Day Field in Ash-
land, Virginia, last Saturday.

The loss lowered the Gener-
als’ overall record to 2-2 and
brought their ODAC mark to
1-1.

‘‘We just didn’t play physical-
ly tough football,” commented
head coach Gary Fallon. ‘‘We
didn’t reach down and execute
like we should on offense and we
didn’t tackle well defensively.”’

The Yellow Jackets took a 7-0
lead two minutes into the game
as quarterback Andy Tate
scampered 30 yards for a touch-
down. W&L evened the score
late in the second period when
sophomore quarterback Al Par-
adise flipped a three-yard scor-
ing pass to junior slotback
Jerry Thompson.

The Generals actually took a
10-7 lead midway through the
third period on a 27-yard field
goal by junior Bill Devine. W&L
could only hold the advantage
until 10:44 of the final period,
however, as a 61-yard scoring
pass from Tate to wide-receiver
Chip Gupton put R-MC ahead
for good, 13-10.

As usual, the Generals relied
heavily on their two star offen-
sive players, Paradise and jun-
ior tailback Chris Cavalline. Ca-
valline carried the ball 30 times
for 100 yards while Paradise
completed 15 of 23 passes for 166
yards and one touchdown.

Once again, however, the
W&L defense proved vulnerable
to the long pass. In each of their
first four games, the Generals
have had one touchdown scored
against them on a pass of sixty
yards or more.

W&L’s defensive secondary,
maintained Fallon, is not en-
tirely to blame. ‘We haven’t
been stopping the other team’s
running as well as we should be.

Because of this, in a play-action
type situation, our secondary is
anxious about coming to sup-
port the defensive line and we
get beaten.”

What makes matters worse is
that next Saturday the Generals
will take on the most effective
passing team in the ODAC, the
Maryville Scots. In addition to
being the top passing team in
the league, Maryville is also the
leading team in rushing and
total offense. The Scots have
averaged almos. 36 points per
game so far this season while
running their record to 4-0.

Said Fallon: ‘Maryville is
definitely a big-play team. They
have a pair of fine quarter-
backs, two sets of powerful run-
ning backs, several outstanding
wide receivers and possibly the
largest defense we’ll see all
year. They have a young team
that might make mistakes
—and I hope they make a bun-
dle of them.”’

The game begins at 1:30 p.m.
on Wilson Field.

11-2 on the year, closed the gap
to two and had a chance to
make the game closer on a
counter-attack breakaway.
However, the Rockets’ goalie,
who was ‘‘very hot,’’ according
to Remillard, broke up the play
and threw the ball downpool
where three Rockets had sur-
rounded goalie Andy Gates. The
score gave Slippery Rock a
three goal lead that W&L was
never able to overcome.

The Generals will get another
chance for revenge in the
Bucknell Tournament in two
weeks. “‘I think Slippery Rock is
extremely concerned about us
getting by them now,” corn-
mented Remillard. ‘‘We have to
win that game.”’

In the meantime, however,
the Generals will compete in the
first half of the ten-team
Southern League Tournament
this weekend at Cy Twombly
Pool. The top four teams at the
conclusion of the second-half, to

be played in Richmond, Oct
23-25; will advance to the
Southern League champion-
ships.

“We are extremely pleased
with our defense. It’s catching
up to our offense now. We’re
creating more turnovers and
getting more and more shots a
game,” explained Remillard.
However, the team only con-
verted on one of 11 power play
opportunities against Slippery
Rock.

All-American Tim Rock was,
according to Remillard, ‘‘a con-
sistently intimidating force
throughout the tournament.”
Junior Eric Peterson tallied 27
times in the five games for the
Generals. Senior Mike Bernot
added 11 goals and sophomore
Rand McClain scored nine.

In its other games, W&L beat
the Pittsburgh Water Polo Club
15-13, the Slippery Rock ‘‘B”
team 13-2, West Virginia 19-4
and Indiana (Pa.) College 13-7.

Packed Roanoke Forces Harriers Into Second

by Rick Swagler

The Washington & Lee cross-
country was narrowly defeated
this past Saturday in a tri-meet
held at Roanoke College. The
team results were fairly close,
with Roanoke finishing first
with 37 points, W&L second with
42 and Norfolk State in third
with 50 points. Next week, the
Generals will travel to Lynch-
burg to take on Lynchburg Col-
lege and Emory & Henry.

For W&L, the battle between
freshman Frank Pittman and
Angus McBryde, a sophomore,
continues. Last week, Pittman
edged McBryde to win the meet
against Mary Washington and
Washington College.

This week it was a different
story. McBryde finished second
over-all and first for W&L with
a time of 29:36. Pittman was

close behind with a third overall
placing and a 29:50 time.

Jon Kelefant moved into the
Generals’ top five with a
seventh place finish and a time
of 30:34. This top five finish,
remember, was predicted by
Paul Chapman last week. Chris
Smith finished fourth for W&L
and 16th overall turning in a
time of 31:52. Paul Chapman
rounded out the W&L top five
with an 18th place finish and a
time of 32:07.

Steve Whetzle, a freshman,
led the race for two miles before
getting a “‘stitch’’ (the same
problem Kelefant had last
week) and was forced to drop
back.

Chapman commented that
the reason Roanoke did so well
was ‘‘they ran in a pack and the
big gap between our third and

 

Bill Devine, the Generals
place kicker, is quickly ap-
proaching the field goal career
record at W&L. Devine con-
nected on a 27-yard field goal
Saturday to give him 12 career
FG's and tie the General mark
in that category. A junior,
Devine is three-for-seven this
season.

fourth finishers hurt us a lot.”
The strategy of running in a
pack was one of the reasons for
W&L’s success last week.

Pittman said that ‘if Whetzle
had finished where he should
have, we could have claimed
Roanoke.”’ Pittman added, ‘‘We
knew we would have a tough
race.”’

McBryde, when asked about
the continuing battle between
Pittman and himself, said
“Pittman and I will have a con-

stant battle which will help us
both and will help the team.””

The times this week were
more than a minute slower than
times recorded in a time trial on
W&L’s course. Coach Miller,
when asked about the dis-
crepancy, commented ‘I think
the (Roanoke) course is long.
It’s faster than ours, but the
times were a minute-plus off.
Their course is probably closer
to 5-1/4 miles. That’s no excuse

for our performance, though.
We all ranon the same course.”’

About the course, Miller said
that ‘‘quite a bit of it was on
pavement and I’m to blame for
(the team) not liking pavement.
We don’t run much on the road
because in the long run, it’s
harder on the legs.”

As Frank Pittman observed,
“I’ve never seen a coach care
for ateam so much.”’

Unlucky Booters Fall To mompeters

by John Harrison

With two closely matched
rivals pitted against each other,
Hampden-Sydney College need-
ed a couple of fluke plays to
escape with a 3-2 victory over
the Washington and Lee soccer
team this past Tuesday.

Both teams had an equal
number of opportunities to
score early in the opening
minutes. It wasn’t until the mid-
dle of the first half that the
Generals got their first hint that
luck would be working against
them.

It began when freshman
keeper John Gindhart, making
his first start of the season,
made an exceptional save by
getting in front of a wicket shot
from point-blank range. The
momentum of the H-SC forward
who took the shot carried him
toward the goal, allowing him to
get just enough on the rebound
that it was able to squib past
Gindhart and into the goal.

W&L tied it at one when
junior Jerry Moyer connected
on a ten-yarder with two
minutes remaining in the first
half. Moyer went on to lead the
Generals’ attack that came ex-
tremely close on several occa-
sions to producing the goal
which would have made the
final 3-3.

Hampden-Sydney took the
lead for the second time mid-
way through the second half as
a result of the first freak play
that gave the Tigers a goal. The
play developed when a H-SC
midfielder lifted a seemingly
harmless shot from forty yards
out to Kirk Mancer, who replac-
ed Gindhart in goal to start the
second half. Before anyone had
time to react, a forward caught
up with the lob and leaped to
head it over Mancer’s shoulder.

The Generals tied the score
for the second and final time as

463-9152

 

ei

a result of forward Brad Poor-
man’s pressure that kept the
ball in the Tigers’ end. His
centering pass from the right
corner got lost in a scramble in
front of the goal. When the ball
was finally jarred loose, junior
Tom Elder was left uncontested
for a 5-footer.

Just a minute and a half later
Hampden-Sydney notched the
game winner on its second fluke
of the day. The play unfolded
when Mancer could not get con-
trol of a weak shot taken from

an angle. This created a wild

scramble in the goal mouth,
with the ball bouncing around in
front of the partially screened
keeper. Before Mancer could
spot the ball, it had trickled just
inches over the goal line.

The loss dropped W&L to .500
(3-3) for the first time this
season. It also put Hampden-
Sydney (3-1) ahead of the
Generals (2-1) in the O.D.A.C.
standings.

Health Committee Offers Services

The University Student
Health Committee is a standing
University committee which
acts in an advisory capacity on
matters pertaining to the scope
and effectiveness of Washing-
ton & Lee’s student health ser-
vices.

The Committee serves as a
continuing avenue of com-
munication between the Univer-
sity Health Service and the stu-
dent body, both by dissem-

inating information on campus
in regard to University health
services policies and _ pro-
cedures and by receiving in-
dividual student complaints,
criticisms, and suggestions.
Students are encouraged to
talk with any of the Student
Health Committee members
listed below concerning any
aspect of the University health
services. In addition, written
comments and complaints

should be submitted to Dean

EC Nukes Spiritual Group;
IVCF Controversy Continues

by Todd Smith
and Jeff Gwynn

The Executive Committee
denied funds to a student group
that would allocate money to
religious and spiritual groups
on campus and provide semi-
nars on philosphical questions.

The Coalition for Spiritual
and Philosophic Inquiry was
formed after the E.C. rejected
the budget proposal of the Inter-
Varsity Christian Fellowship,
and recommended that they
return with a new name.

Bill Archer and Jon Pakula,
who led the fight against E.C.
support of IVCF, joined with
Frank Williams and Gary
Carneal, of the Christian group,
to speak for the Coalition.

Ted McQuistion, ’84 rep., said
that last week’s denial of funds
to IVCF was due to the commit-
tee’s reluctance to fund a
religious organization with stu-
dent body funds.

“We appropriate in lump
sum, they appropriate it down
through the ranks,’’ McQuiston
offered as the way the Coali-
tion’s funding would work,”’...I
can’t distinguish the difference

ns

(between that and outright
funding of the IVCF).”

Secretary Bennett Ross said
that the motion passed last
week did not rule out support
for religious organizations.

“It was inherent in the motion
that we wouldn’t fund an organ-
ization with a religiously ex-
clusive name, such as IVCF,
but the motion said please come
back for a funding request with
a different organization, which
they have,”’ said Ross.

Morgan Griffith, Law rep.,
noted that the Coalition’s
framework did not include a
rigid constituion specifying how
many students would constitute
a group eligible for Coalition
funds, and therefore he could
not support it.

Ben Hale, ’84 rep., stated that
student body funds should go to
no organization that proposed to
propogate its faith among
students.

John Viahoplus moved that
the E.C. recommend some ac-
tion by the president of the
university. A letter will be sent
to Robert Huntley, president,

“in regard to the need to
establish and fund an alter-
native life-style with specific
reference to spiritual develop-
ment through a coalition.”’

In other action, the E.C.
heard from the chairman and
treasurer of the Mock Conven-
tion, Chairman Bud White an-
nounced that the Sumners
Foundation of Texas had pro-
vided Washington and Lee
University with a $100,000 en-
dowment for use by the Mock
Convention.

Interest of 5.5 percent on the
endowment will provide $20,000
or more to the convention every
four years.

Hale reported that he was
conferring with President
Huntley and Dean Lewis G.
John about placing student
body reserves in a money
market account.

President Eric Myers read
this statement into the minutes:
the Honor System applies fully
in the University Library Sys-
tem; all materials used are to
be checked out through the
main desk.

She is Pamela Hemenway Simpson, the new Assistant Dean of

Anti-nuke and pro choice_regarding abortion, she is the ‘first

regular appointment to the university’s faculty and is now the first
woman to ever receive a deanship (unless one counts the time dur-
ing WWII when the school opened co-educationally during the sum-
mer and appointed a Dean of Women. But that was for financial
reasons, So, no, don’t count that).

“But I’m also the first art historian ever to receive this position,”
she notes, pointing to the fact that sexual genre hardly serves as
criteria for determining job qualification. ‘The administration’s

ecutive producer of the weekly
television series, ‘‘Tony

Washington & Lee University
on Thursday, Oct. 22, at 8 p.m.
in Lee Chapel.

Brown’s appearance at Wash-

Journal” is the longest-running,
nationally syndicated black af-
fairs program on television.
Brown joined “Black Journal,”’

and took the program to com-
mercial television in 1972.

Formerly host and moderator

qualified — although I don’t think you can divorce the fact.”

Dean Simpson cites her qualifications for her job as ‘‘serving on
the Executive Council and University Council, working with
publicity, and getting along well with the students.’’ Perhaps the
latter is what most students here know her so well for. And perhaps
that’s because she was a student too, once.

“I was what we considered a ‘freak’ in college and what the
media labeled ‘hippie.’ A freak was anyone that was different in
1968,’’ she remembers. A student at Gettysburg College, Dr. Simp-
son participated actively in anti-war protests and the singing of
peace songs.

‘Viet Nam was an incredibly absurd, obscene war,”’ she says. ‘‘I
remember picketing the Dow Corporation — they’re the ones that
made napalm. One sign I carried read ‘Draft Beer, Not Boys.’ ”

Simpson received her Masters Degree from the University of

There’s ‘Justice’ After All

by Todd Jones

Ruth Loomis has just been ap-
pointed as the first woman
Supreme Court Justice. Al-
though her appointment to the
court brings great joy to most of
the women in America, Justice
Dan Snow is not that excited. He
tells the C.J. (Chief Justice),
“Watch it — there are only
eight of us left against all of
her.’’ First Monday in October
is a movie which should delight
most viewers, not only because
of fine acting, but also due to a
well-written, very funny, script.

First Monday stars Walter
Matthau as Dan Snow, a Justice
on the Supreme Court for many
years. He is a liberal, and is
known as “The Great Dis-
senter.”” He loves to climb
mountains, and also to defend
the First Amendment. He is
quite obviously fashioned after
the late justice William
Douglas, even down to suffering
a stroke in his 23rd year on the
bench.

The latest appointment to the
Court, Ruth Loomis, is played
by Jill Clayburgh. She comes
from Orange County, Califor-
nia, and is a staunch conser-
vative. Needless to say, she and
Matthau spend most of the film
bickering over different issues
before the court. In their first
dispute, Justice Loomis would
like to ban a pornographic film
which she feels is offensive.
Justice Snow believes that the

film should be allowed to be
shown under the provisions
allowed in the First Amend-
ment. Snow argues, ‘‘What is it
about the film that makes it so
offensive? Is it the title — ‘The
Naked Nymphomaniac?’
Maybe it is the other word that
bothers you — Nym-pho-
maniac. What if it were called
‘The Naked Methodist?’”’

There are some interesting
moments in the film. I have just
finished reading The Brethren,
by Woodward and Armstrong,
and I found that some of the in-
cidents in the book were also
found in this movie. One inci-
dent in particular involved
Charles Lampkin, who played
the role fashioned after
Thurgood Marshall. In the mid-
dle of a screening for a por-
nographic film, the announcer
comments that this nympho-
maniac can never be cured of
her increasing desire for
physical pleasure. Marshall (or
Lampkin) comments, ‘‘Well, I
don’t know about her, but I sure
am.”

The film is full of insults and
jibes of one sort or another.
Matthau has most of them, and
delivers them excellently. His
performance is of the calibre
that is expected of a fine com-
edic actor. He displays his
talents impressively. Clay-
burgh is also given several good
lines. At one point in the film,
Matthau tells Clayburgh that
she doesn’t have the money to
pay for a cab. Clayburgh
retorts, ‘‘You liberals never
do!’’ Whether you are liberal or
conservative, there are enough
good lines floating about the
film to make any serious party
ally chuckle at the opposition as
well as at himself.

The only shortcoming of First
Monday is that it was rushed to
be distributed when O’Connor
was announced as the latest
Supreme Court Justice.
Because of this, not enough
time seemed to be given to the
ending of the film, which I
thought was a little weak.

Regardless of the ending,
First Monday is a tremendously
enjoyable film. The movie

abounds with excellent
dialogue, most of which centers
around Matthau’ and

free of charge. There will be an
open reception in the Lewis Hall
lobby after each night’s screen-
ing.

Blier’s cinema constructs a
world of male fantasies and
males’ images of women which
real women inhabit with a
mysterious and disruptive
force. In Get Out Your Hand-
kerchiefs, Blier explores the
marriage of a man who thinks

that because his wife chews her’

food without gusto, she must be
bored with him. Loving his wife,
and wanting to preserve the
marriage, the husband brings a
friend into the relationship, but
his wife, tired perhaps of being
told what she must be feeling,
meanwhile falls in love with a
thirteen-year old boy who
makes no claim to know what
she is wanting or feeling. He
asks to be taught.

Elaborating with wry affec-
tion on the various combina-
tions of love and friendship
possible among these four
characters, the movie pays

The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Germany, 1919) ‘Classic horror
film, valued not only for its impressionistic sets and clever story,
but for its unmistakable influence on German film-making of the
twenties. Werner Krauss and Conrad Veidt starred, Robert Weine

to thrill.’” — from Halliwell’s Filmgoer’s Companion. Shown by the

Program, presents its second
movie, Okoto and Sasuke, on

on Shunkinsho, Junichiro
Tanizaki’s 1933 novel about an
imperious blind musician and
her devoted servant. The movie
will be shown in the original

Hollins, Va.

We started this series winding
up Rte. 60 to Sweet Briar and
last week we rambled north on
Interstate. 81 to Mary Baldwin.
Therefore, it seems only logical
to end our guide by travelling
south on Rte. 81 to Hollins Col-
lege, that citadel of southern

- womanhood located only a few
' miles outside of Roanoke.

The term ‘‘Hollins’’ invokes
raised eyebrows from most
under and upperminks at W&L.
Hollins girls carry the reputa-
tion of the best looking of all
local females. Hollins also
seems to draw the girls with the
biggest bucks. Looks and
money, not a bad combination.

But before going down to
Hollins, underminks are ad-
vised to if any way possible get
their favorite collie to visit Lex-
ington. In terms of partying,
Hollins ranks in the fair-to-poor
category.

But if you are intent on
travelling down to Hollins, here
are a few observations.

The road to Hollins is the
equal in boredom to the Mary
Baldwin journey, only this time
you're going south rather than
north. Once you get to Hollins,
you'll notice a campus much
resembling a small Baptist
school. Among the dorms and
buildings of academia, one will

include adequate party space.

To its credit, Hollins does
have a beer joint named the
Rathskeller. Unfortunately, it’s
about the only location that can
handle large groups.

Dancing is never possible, as
the local dancing facilities ac-
commodate one or two dozen
shaggers tops. And if you ever
thirst for a beer, forget it.
Hollins girls operate under the
misguided judgment that you
should tap only one keg at a
time. Beer lines are numbered
according to hours, days and
weeks.

One ritual you would be better
off missing is the annual Tinker
Day celebration, which was
held several weeks ago. Hollins
girls rush up to the top of Tinker
Mountain then spend the day
having a picnic. The event is
conveniently held on a day
when classes can be cancelled
It’s a tough life.

But for all its problems,
Hollins is still an inviting
package for road-faring minks.
The best trapping occurs in the
middle of the week, when most
females can be caught in their
rooms.

Most minks don’t seem tc
mind the shortcomings, either.
They keep coming back in
flocks, be it a Saturday night
dance or a Sunday afternoor
party.

So when you have a few hours
to kill, visit the green-and-gold
at Hollins. You'll probably re.

Generals Upset Scots

by Dale Park

Before a Homecoming crowd
of 3,137 at Wilson Field last
Saturday, the Washington &
Lee varsity football team hung
on to a 14-0 halftime advantage
and squeaked past ODAC rival
Maryville College, 14-12.

The Scots topped the
Generals in almost every major
Statistical category, yet
Maryville, the league’s leading
team in both passing and
rushing, was unable to score in
the first half.

Head coach Gary Fallon com-
mented that his W&L defense
had “come to life’ after a poor
showing in last week’s loss to
Randolph-Macon College. Said
Fallon, ‘We played an ag-
gressive type of team defense in
which we swarmed to the ball.
We weren’t just grabbing at
people this time.’’

While the defense sealed off
Maryville’s offense, the W&L
offense got on track, scoring all
14 points in the first half.

Sophomore quarterback Al
Paradise directed the Generals
on an eight play, 63-yard scor-
ing drive late in the first

Generals Survived A Tough Test

by John Cleghorn

Saturday’s game was a big
one for the 1981 Generals. They
went into the game with an even
.500 mark and a chance to fall
into a losing schedule or to sus-
tain their winning efforts. The
decision was bigger than a
midseason record might in-
dicate. The mark of 3-2 ties the
record for the best start for
W&L football in 14 years. A
record of 2-3 might only resem-
ble the unpleasant, mediocre
past.

The Generals stood up to the
test though, and it was by no
means a simple one. Maryville
brought the ODAC’s _ stongest
passing attack to a secondary
that had gotten taken for a com-
pletion of 60 yards or more in
each of its four games. The
results could have been

disastrous. Instead, Gary
Fallon implemented a five man
secondary that effectively
stopped the pass outake. It was
certainly a team effort as each
time the Maryville QB faded to
pass the entire bench became a
defender in yells ‘Pass!’ and
appropriately ‘‘short” or
“Jong.’”’ They didn’t sound much
like a boys choir but it obviously
worked. The pass rush was also
effective in forcing the QB to
scramble.

Midway through the season
last year Larry Munson, the
University of Georgia football
announcer, upon noticing their
undefeated record prophetical-
ly asked ‘‘Have you looked at
the rest of the schedule?”’ So
now, have you? The win Satur-
day was vital to the Generals’
ODAC quest. They have only

two ODAC losses, an attribute
only three teams can boast. But
that does not mean we are there
yet. In the second half of the
season there remain three
ODAC teams. The Generals
must continue to perform as
they did Saturday.

It was a sweet homecoming
indeed, though mostly for the
football players. It still remains
quite a paradox that for a
weekend intended to highlight
the football team, the game is
the least attended event of the
weekend.

quarter, capped off by a one-
yard touchdown plunge by
junior tailback Chris Cavalline.
Paradise himself scrambled for
a score from twelve yards out
late in the second quarter as
W&L built a 14-0 halftime lead.

Although W&L did not score
in the second half, Fallon main-
tained that his team was not
playing it safe. ‘“‘We knew that
fourteen points may not be
enough, yet we sometimes lack
the killer instinct as a team and,
as a result, the game was
close,” said the coach.

The Scots’ explosive offense
didn’t get rolling until the final
five minutes of the third
quarter, when Maryville mar-
ched 95 yards in ten plays and
finally scored on a 42-yard
touchdown pass. The conver-
sion failed, however, and in-
stead of trailing by only seven
points, Maryville trailed by
eight, 14-6.

The Scots mounted another
long scoring drive late in the
fourth quarter. Taking over on
their own 20-yard line, Mary-
ville took five minutes and 17

plays before pushing the ball in-
to the endzone on a one-yard
scoring run. Maryville failed to
convert on its two-point at-
tempt, and two missed conver-
sions proved to be the margin of
W&L’s 14-12 win.

The victory was the first for
the Generals in five contests
against Maryville. The win left
W&L with a 3-2 overall record
and a 2-1 mark in the ODAC.
For Maryville, it was the first
loss of the season. The Scots’
overall record slipped to 4-1
while their ODAC mark fell to
3-1 — still Slightly ahead of the
Generals in league play.

Next Saturday the Generals
will try to improve their ODAC
record as they travel to Hamp-
den Sydney to take on the
Tigers. Last season W&L
claimed a 17-13 victory over H-
SC, but Fallon warns that ‘‘we
can’t be fooled by the H-SC’s 1-4
record so far. They have an ex-
plosive offense and will be sky-
high for us. It’s their Homecom-
ing, and this game could make
their whole season for them.”’

Tied for the lead with a 50
record after the first half of the
Southern League water polo
tournament, Washington & Lee
(16-2) will compete at the
Bucknell Tournament this
weekend.

Three of the top four teams on
the east coast will be there, ac-
cording to Coach Page Remil-
lard. They are Brown, Slippery
Rock (remember them?), and
Bucknell. The Generals will
open-against Cornell on Friday
before facing Slippery Rock and
Brown on Saturday. Should they
then have complied one of the
top two records in that division,
they will move on to the finals
with two teams from the other
division, which includes
Bucknell and Richmond.

The Generals undefeated
record last weekend was the

same as that of Richmond. The
two teams will meet next week-
end during the final half of the
league tourney. The top four
finishers from the tourney ad-
vance to the league champion-
ships Nov. 7-8 at W&L.

Duke gave W&L its stiffest
test of the weekend as the
Generals came away with a 12-8
win. ‘We didn’t get a lot of
breaks in the game (W&L had
two goals called back by
penalties), and there were a lot
of whistles,” said Remillard.
‘“‘Under adversity, we played
extremely well. We were too
tense before the game and
made some mistakes. We’re
just glad we got it out of the
way.”

Washington & Lee downed
VMI 21-3, the University of
North Carolina 20-5, Lynchburg

Virginia 11-1. The Generals’

Booters Take
First Shutout

by John Harrison

The Washington & Lee soccer
team dropped a 1-0 decision to
Division II member Radford
last Saturday. The Generals’
first shutout of the year left
them with a 3-4 mark, the first
time they have fallen below
-500.

Head coach Rolf - Piranian
described the match as “‘very
competitive. The score doesn’t
indicate the effort both teams
gave. The outcome could easily

have been the other way
around.”

Kadesky stopped 73 percent of
their opponents’ shots.

In addition, Remillard was
“totally impressed’’ with his
top four substitutes, who saw
lots of action. Sophomores Matt
Ravencraft and Keith Kadesky
scored ten goals apiece and
freshman Bobby Pearson added
six.

The team now has its sights
set on the Bucknell Tournament
and Slippery Rock in par-
ticular. Remillard said he will
be pleased if his team comes
away witha 2-3 record.

And if they go 0-3, failing to
make the finals?

“T would not want to be this
water polo team on Monday,”
offered Remillard.

Asked if the Generals could
beat Slippery Rock and revenge
two losses suffered earlier this
season, Mike Bernot, the only
senior on the squad, said,
“‘We’ll be up for them.”’

Harriers Place Second
In Lynchburg Tri-Meet

by Rick Swagler
The Washington & Lee cross-
country team placed second in a
tri-meet held this past Saturday
in Lynchburg. Lynchburg Col-
lege placed first with 30 points,

W&L was second with 43 points.

and Norfolk State University
was third with 56 points.

For the Generals, Angus
McBryde finished fourth over-
all and first for W&L with a
time of 27:40 over the five-mile
course. Frank Pittman was
eight seconds behind McBryde
and finished fifth overall. Jon
Kelefant was back in good form
with a seventh place finish and
a 28:06 clocking. Paul Chapman
finished eleventh overall in
28:43 and Steve Whetzle round-
ed out the Generals’ top five
with a 16th place finish and a
time of 29:31.

McBryde commented that the
main reason for the defeat was
that he and Pittman ‘“‘lost con-
tact with the leaders and had to
play catch up.’’ McBryde added
that the course was ‘‘a perfect
mixture of pavement, trails and
fields, but it was confusing.”
The fact that the course was

confusing was also noted by
Assistant Coach Paul Thomson.

Thomson added that not only
was the course confusing, but
“the crowd yelled obscenities
and called us ‘preppies’ which
momentarily broke some of our
guys’ concentration.”’ Thomson
was especially pleased with the
performance of Tony Ierardi, a
senior running first year of
cross-country. Ierardi finished
sixth for the Generals and 17th
overall, turning in a time of
29:49.

Coach Dick Miller’s only com-
ment on the race was, ‘‘They
ran faster than we did.’’ He did
comment on Kelefant’s perfor-
mance, saying that the junior
was back where he should be.

Captain Greg Branan, re-
covering from tendonitis, said

that he was proud of the team.
Branan commented that ‘the

two-edged sword. They have a
lot of exuberance, but I’m not
sure they fully understand what

They’ve set high goals, but I

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENTS

The Case For...

Once again, it is time to settle the question of the
Executive Committee and constitutional amend-
ments. Last year’s efforts, if you remember, ended in
nothing less than total chaos, as the proposals failed
due to a lack of student participation. Again the EC is
proposing changes and again the changes are subject
to the whims of the student body.

At first glance, the amendments should go through
untouched. Most of the changes are cosmetic — they
serve only to clear up vague and otherwise hazy
language. At least this is the case for five of the seven
amendments. The other two amendments, as we shall
see, have a direct bearing on what you will read in the
future.

 

If you like an EC that not only can make the paper
but run it, then you should get out and vote.

The Case Against...

Hopefully, students will not be buffaloed into believ-
ing that every amendment is meaningless. Amend-
ment Seven, tucked away neatly at the end of the pro-
posals, expands the EC’s power from ‘‘appellate
jurisdiction” to that of ‘“‘powers of review.’’ We feel
that the EC’s intervention is uneccessary in that the
EC has as much a right to direct the school’s publica-
tions as the school’s publications have a right to
operate the EC. If the EC is so desperate to control
matters brought up by student publications, then
perhaps the publications should spend more time wat-
ching the EC.

One legitimate question is raised. If the school’s
publications serve as a watchdog of student govern-
ment, then what happens when the EC places a
stonger leash on the watchdog? The answer, of
course, is that all facets of government and publica-
tions become weaker.

Editors of student publications have traditionally
been elected by the Publication Board, which is com-
prised of past and present editors. The EC, which
may claim an editor or two from high school and
perhaps a college editor now attending the law school,
wants to have the final say. Yes, the professionals will
be replaced by the amateurs.

Perhaps the EC and student publications could
develop an exchange program. In exchange for con-
trol of publications, the EC could cede all honor mat-
ters and budget hearings to the Publications Board.
The Board likely knows as much about the ad-
ministration of the honor sysytem as the EC does
about running a newspaper, a yearbook or a literary
magazine.

The EC gives funds for student publications. Now it
wants more influence in the publications themselves.
Next thing you know, Eric Myers and Co. will be per-
sonally hand-cranking the presses.

If we are all to be viewed as reasonably intelligent
adults, then why is all this need for review necessary?

 

 

 

 

 

Can The IVCF Be Called LealEiehatet

Dear Sir:

On Oct. 6, the E.C. denied
funds to the Ly.C.F. (Inter-
Varsity Christian Fellowship)
on the grounds that it was not
“proper”? for the student
government to ‘‘legitimize” a
religious group by granting
them funds. Since the E.C. cur-
rently views itself as an
organization founded upon the
heritage of the United States
Constitution, it was felt that
they had no right to support any
group with a particular relig-
ious affiliation. If their original
premise is accepted, their deci-
sion was correct. However, I
would like to present a different
interpretation of the argument.

I feel that the E.C. is a group
which has been chosen by the
student body to represent its in-
terests in the everyday activ-
ities of student government. As
I understand it, each student
pays $55 to the school for a
general fund which is used to
fund a variety of student
organizations. These organiza-
tions are required to submit a
request for funds and a budget
of sorts to the E.C. which
evaluates the merits of each
group and allots funds as it sees
fit. If the 1.V.C.F. is viewed
simply as a group of students
which has meetings, speakers
and social gatherings on a
regular basis, I believe,
although I could be wrong, that
more W&L students participate
in this group than in several
other funded groups. Viewed at
this level, the I.V.C.F. provides
a service to the student body
which should be allowed to have
student funds.

Now arises the question of
‘legitimizing’ a_ religious
group by granting it funds. One
member of the E.C. stated that
if the I.V.C.F. is granted funds
then if a ‘Jim Jones”’ type cult
comes in with 100 members, the
E.C. would be obliged to give
them funds. As far as I can see,
if an organization is deemed to
provide for a need of a signifi-
cant portion of the student body,
and no one disputes that the
1.V.C.F. does this, then it is en-
titled to a portion of the E.C.
funds set aside for this purpose.

In closing, I would like to sug-
gest that the E.C. investigate
the possibility that there could

 

be a significant difference in the
respective intents of the U.S.
Constitution and the W&L stu-
dent government. Also, I for one
would be interested in seeing
how other student governments
at different institutions had
handled this problem.
Sincerely,
Frank L. Eppes ’83

Butiiod About Rubbers

Dear Sir:

I would like to call your atten-
tion to two advertisements from
the second page of your Sept. 17
issue of the Ring-tum Phi, one
for McCrums’ and the other for
Herring Travel.

There are certain things in
life that go without saying, and
surely you must be aware that
the ad for Trojans prophylac-
tics is to say the least inap-
propriate for a_ college

newspaper’ (university
newspaper?) with a wide cir-
culation. The fact that W&L
students have used the product
for years has nothing to do with
the bad taste of the ad.

The other ad has a typograph-
ical error. It should read ‘‘Se
habla espanol.”’

I hope you will be more
discreet in future issues.

Sincerely,
Robert L. Amsler

SIGN. HE'S GOT T00

 

by Garry Trudeau

 

 
 

Students returning to Lexington this fall have been thrust before

“la television screen crammed with three new channels, increasing

competition and viewer frustration in more ways than one.
Ted Turner can be thanked, or blamed, for most of the current

_|video onslaught. It is his Channel 17, his ESPN and his Cable Net-

work News (CNN) that have changed the general picture. The
other addition is the Christian Broadcast Network (CBN), with 700

_|Club host Pat Robertson talking up a host of religious fanatics,
“lright-wing lunatics and other assorted jingoes.

When Alf Goodykoontz, editor of the Richmond Times-Dispatch,
was at W&L last winter he addressed the subject of growing cable
echnology. He said that, with all the new channels popping up and
little original programming available, the stations would be forced

 

“Jto show products, he put it, ‘from 1937.” He was right; old flicks

and re-runs fill the bill.
And the bill is full, however light. It is the movie addict's dream

_for nightmare, depending on the extent of addiction. A few weeks
“Jago, for instance, at 1 in the afternoon, there was Dinner at Eight on

 

5, Intermezzo on 20, and All Through the Night, with Carole Lombard,
on 17. Bliss or agony.

If less than half of the student
body turns out next week to vote
on the constitutional referen-
dum’ the Executive Committee
faces another year of frustra-
tion.

Polls will be open Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday.

Of the seven proposals, no. 3,
which will make it easier to
amend the constitution, no. 4,
which allows the law school
earlier representation on the
Committee, and no. 7, which
clears up cloudy language to
establish the E.C. as_ the
reviewer of decisions made by
the Publications Board, are the
most important of the proposed
revisions.

A two thirds majority of
ballots cast will approve the
revisions.

Elimination of the office of
treasurer is the intent of Pro-
posal 1. The E.C. has functioned

 

for several years without a
treasurer and wants to update
this section.

Membership criteria would
be clarified for the Publications
Board by Proposal 2. This spells
out the positions of two
members-at-large on the Pub
Board, which chooses editors
and business managers for
theAriel, Calyx, and Ring-tum
Phi.

The most important of the
proposed revisions is the third
which states that only on third
of the student body need vote,
with two thirds’ approval, for
amendments to the constitu-
tion. Fifty percent participation
in a referendum is now re-
quired. Despite several at-
tempts to amend the constituion
last year, a majority of students
never turned out to cast ballots
at one time, and idiosyncracies
have not been purged.

One such idiosyncracy is law
school elections. The constitu-

Myers also noted that E.C.
members were asked by Dr.
Edward Hamer to serve on
panels during Parents Weekend
to discuss student life.

Petitions. were received and
rules were set for freshman and
first year law student elections.
Seven students applied for
Freshman Class President, six
applied for Vice President,

seven for E.C. Representative,
and seven law students applied
for the E.C. first year law stu-
dent position.

Freshmen are allowed to

spend no more than $10 and
have no more than 15 posters, to

be put in the dorms, in the R.E.
Lee Hotel, and the dining hall.
Law students may place posters
in the dining hall and the law
school.

EC Proposes Seven Amendments

tion specifies the third Monday
in October for freshman and
first year law class elections.
After this was established in the
constitution, the law school
calendar changed, and they are
now in school for ten weeks
before represented on the E.C.
The fourth proposal would man-
date elections in the sixth week
of classes, no matter what the
date.

The date when the E.C. swit-
ches from old to new members
is clarified by Proposal 5. Of-
ficers elected in the spring are
supposed to enter office after
commencement, but the con-
stitution does not specify
whether that is the under-
graduate or the law school com-
mencment. This revision would
specify that each would com-
mence with his office after the
commencement of his own col-
lege.

Proposal 6 throws a modify-
ing phrase into the constitution
so that a request from the Ex-
ecutive Committee “‘now in of-
fice’ will result in a student
body meeting.

What “‘appelate jurisdiction”
means, no one knows, and this
year’s E.C. thinks it means that
all decisions by the Publications
Board, to which the term ap-
plies in the constitution, are
subject to review and rejection
by the E.C., whether the Pub
Board appeals or not. The
seventh proposal makes clear a
subordination of the Pub Board
to the E.C.

is such an obnoxious personality it makes you wonder how he stays
on the air until you realize how many fat and otherwise vacant
women occupy this great nation of ours. Simmons is such a limp-
wristed flit that even to sit through one of his commercials is a
nerve wrenching ordeal. One spot features the fay star in an ornate
bubble bath, towel wrapped around his head, chattering on a
French telephone with one of his millions of obese fans. Sample:
“Oh hi, Helen, say, I’m going to be in the kitchen this afternoon
baking and stuff. You simply must come over and I’1] show you how
to make dough in the Vita-mix and some marvy low-cal salad
dressing...”

CNN is pretty good, spread expectedly thin (especially into the
wee hours). About its greatest advantage, other than being a cons-
tant source of news, is its live coverage of events usually seen only
in 2-14 minute spurts on the evening news. Most recently speeches,
press conferences, a funeral and museum dedication have been the
subjects of attention.

CBN is the pits. In addition to Pat Robertson’s gab and moralize
sessions it relies on one old movie per week, usually one of poor
visual quality with Rosalind Russell or Loretta Young, which runs
over and over. Plus old T.V. shows that haven’t seen the light of day
(deservedly so) since the Eisenhower administration: Life of Riley
with William Bendix, Bachelor Father with pre-Dynasty John For-
sythe and, of all things, Gale Storm in My Little Margie (yuk! ).

Some of the best oldies may be seen twice a day on different chan-
nels — M*A*S*H, All in the Family, some of the Carol Burnetts.
Bob Newhart and Mary Tyler Moore are not to be found. Channel 5
jerked I Love Lucy from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 a.m., a difficult time for
even the most die-hard fans. (The Ricardoes and the Mertzes, by
the way, were last spotted in Hollywood, and that whacky red-head
had hidden under Cornel Wilde’s breakfast cart).

At any rate, there aren’t enough good T.V. shows made in all
history to adequately fill the schedules of large metropolitan sta-
tions. Hour-long shows, such as the Rockford Files or The Waltons,
have become popular. But an hour is potentially dangerous to a
society overwhelmed by weak or apathetic minds. Drivel like the
Love Boat and violent crap like Starsky and Hutch can either numb
brain cells faster than drugs or fill impressionable minds with
dangerous ideas.

The only conceivable redemption imposed by having more chan
nels is a larger array of refuse from which to choose. If this selec-
tion ran the gamut from awful to decent it would be one thing; as it
is, for the most part, a pot pourri of mediocrity lies waiting at our
fingertips.

Of course, I never watch T.V.

Fall Lecture Series, “The Art
and Architecture of England,”
next week.

On Mon. Oct. 19 at 4:30 p.m.,
world-famous potter David
Leach will lecture in Northen
Auditorium of the University
Library. The lecture is entitled
“Fifty Years With and Without
Bernard Leach.”’

David Leach is the son of Ber-
nard Leach, who led the English
studio pottery movement in the
early years of this century.

At the age of 19, David Leach
began to work in his father’s
pottery at St. Ives. A teacher,
writer and popular lecturer, he
has exhibited in Europe, the
United States, and the Far
East.

In 1950, he designed and made
the David Leach Electric Kiln.
And in 1966, he started a
workshop at Bovey Travey,
where he now makes a large
percentage of porcelain.

On Tuesday, Oct. 20, Sheldon
Rothblatt, professor of history
at the University of California
at Berkeley, will lecture on
“Culture and Horticulture: The
English Garden in the 18th Cen-
tury.” Rothblatt’s lecture is at 8
p.m. in duPont Auditorium.

A native of Los Angeles, Roth-
blatt specializes in graduate
and undergraduate courses in
British and European history at
Berkeley, where he has taught
since 1963. Educated at
Berkeley and King’s College of
Cambridge University,
Rothblatt is also associate
director of the Center for
Studies in Higher Education at
Berkeley.

He has been a Woodrow
Wilson Fellow and was the
Ehrman Student at King’s Col-
lege, Cambridge. He has been a
Social Science Research Coun-
cil Faculty Fellow in London, a
Shelby Cullom Davis Fellow at
the Davis Center of Princeton
University, a Guggenheim
Fellow and Visitor of Nuffield
College, Oxford University, and
a scholar-in-residence at the
Rockefeller Center in Bellagio,

Italy.

Rothblatt is the author of two
books, ‘‘The Revolution of the
Dons: Cambridge and Society
in Victorian London’’ (1968) and
“Tradition and Change ‘in
English Liberal Education: An

ing at Virginia Military In-
stitute on Wednesday, Oct. 21.
His topic at VMI is ‘The
Growth of Victorian London.”’
The lecture will be at 8 p.m. in
the Engineering Auditorium of
Nichols Hall.

On Wednesday, Oct. 21, David
Durant, well-known English
author, lecturer and _ broad-
caster, will discuss ‘“The Great
Era of English Portrait Paint-
ing’ at 8 p.m. in duPont
Auditorium.

Durant’s most recent books
include biographies of Bess of
Hardwick and Lady Arbella
Stuart as well as a study of
Raleigh’s Lost Colony. His
study of these famous people
has led him to an intensive in-
vestigation of the great tradi-
tion of English portraiture.

All the lectures are open to
the public and are free.

Coleman Named AV Center Director

MD Has Smashing Time At Pavilion

The 1981-82 fund raising drive
for Muscular Dystrophy began
with a bang Saturday with a car
smash at Zollman’s Pavilion.

The four-door Dodge Dart,
donated by James and Sons
Used Auto Parts of Lexington,
was belted almost 400 times by
party-goers at the Pavillion. At
25 cents a hit, the project raised
about $99 for the Muscular

Dystrophy Association.

The only expense incurred
from the event was two broken
sledgehammers. According to
Superdance Publicity Chair-
man Brian Gibson, the car
smash will likely become an an-
nual event in conjunction with
Homecoming.

The car smash marked the
beginning of this year’s

Muscular Dystrophy fund rais-
ing drive, which culminates in
the fourth Annual Superdance
Jan. 29-31. The 30-hour dance
marathon will again feature a
variety of bands and activities.

Contact Carole Chappell if in-
terested in serving on a com-
mittee for the dance or if you
would like to dance in the
marathon itself.

Simpson Proves To Be A Not-So-Average Dean

test of the Cambodian incursion. I finally got the thesis in two days
later — once they released the school’s president,”’ she recalls with
a laugh.

“I’m pretty liberal...a humanist. There is no reason at all why the
ERA should not be passed,”’ she says, citing the feminist movement
as one reason she holds her current administrative post. She
doesn’t mind admitting that she thinks W&L will be co-ed in
another ten years: ‘‘for financial reasons if nothing else, but
hopefully because we realize it’s in our best interests...women in
= classroom would make W&L a more human and interesting
place.”’

Simpson feels co-education at W&L could change the hard drink-
ing fraternity social life, one of the things she dislikes. “If the
macho climate changed, so would the social life.’’ She recalls a
favorite quote to illustrate her point: ‘‘‘The definition of a Southern
Gentleman is a W&L student who apologizes after vomiting on his
date’s dress.’ Hopefully, our gentlemen will be more than that and
respect the rights, desires, and feelings of other people.”

Dean Simpson finds the modern drug culture very frightening.
“Marijuana must be handled like alcohol — with an attitude of
maturity and an understanding of one’s behavior,” she says,
stressing that the drug is illegal.

Her attitudes on sex echo those she holds on drugs. ‘‘Sex is like
dynamite...it has to be handled maturely or people are going to get
hurt,” she says. She feels that sexual experience before marriage
is part of today’s society. Regarding. homosexuality: ‘There are
for one reason or another a good deal of people who prefer sex with
members of the same sex. Society or no one else has a right to in-
terfere with things done between mature, consenting adults ir
privacy.”’

On the issue of abortion the dean comments, “I don’t like the idea
of abortion as a birth control method, but it is an alternative if all
else fails.” She believes that women have a right to their own

bodies and their own lives, and that’s one reason the Moral Majori-

ty frightens her.

“The Moral Majority members are not true conservatives. True
conservatives don’t want laws controlling life and that is what
these people want,’’ she says. Her own religious beliefs are describ-
ed by her as somewhat agnostic. ‘I’m a humanist, that is someone
who sees their belief in context of all beliefs and not necessarily as
truth.’’ Raised in the Lutheran Church and now attending the
Episcopal Church, Pam says: ‘‘I have a concept of a divine being
and moral values. If there is a God and after-life, fine — but it’s
really rather irrelevant now. Our problems here have to be worked
out among ourselves, but not by divine intervention.”

Dr. Simpson sees the current political situation as negating a lot
of advances made by liberal thinkers. “‘I dislike everything Reagan
has done. Under his programs, the ones who can stand the least to
suffer (financially ) are the ones that will.”

Simpson stressed that her outspoken views are not necessarily
shared by W&L but the professor is inclined more toward art than
politics anyway. After marrying in 1970, she received her doctorate
from the University of Delaware, which she claims to be the best
school for her specialty —American architecture. This specialty
led her in conjunction with Royster Lyle to write The Architecture
of Historic Lexington. A grant from the National Endowment for
the Humanities in 1974 resulted in the completed work in 1975.

The book, dealing with the high-style architecture found in the
Lexington area, was published by the University of Virginia press
in 1977. Since that time Simpson and Lyle have been researching
vernacular architecture found within Rockbridge County and
hopes to have her work ready for publication in the next two years.
She has the raw data (a study of over 300 pre-1817 houses) and now
must assemble it.

Where is this expert art historian, self-acclaimed “original
bleeding-heart liberal”’ going to be in ten years? Right here.

“I’m terribly happy here at W&L and see no reason to leave,’’ she
smiles. In the meantime, she’ll be working for changes at W&L in
the areas of minority enrollment and co-education, drinking half-
cups of coffee, and smoking True menthol cigarettes.

National Chapter Steps In To
Save SNU From Collapse

by Rob Schlegel

Rumors have been cir-
culating on campus this year
about the existence of Sigma Nu
fraternity. Regardless of what
you may have heard, however,
the Lambda chapter of Sigma
Nu at Washington & Lee has not
folded and, in fact, the fraterni-
ty is in a complicated rebuilding
year.

Sigma Nu’s troubles first
began with financial matters.

According to University
Treasurer Stewart Epley, the
fraternity borrowed money
from the university about seven
years ago for capital construc-
tion. Epley said that Sigma Nu
has met all its payments this
year and that the fraternity is
not in default. Epley also noted
that almost all the fraternities
on campus owe money to the
university.

fairs Dan Murphy had no com-

New Regulation Will Restrict Loans

‘by Bill Roberts

Guaranteed student loans will
no longer be available to anyone
regardless of income. A new
regulation requiring applicants
with family incomes over
$30,000 a year to demonstrate
financial need, became effec-
tive Oct. 1. Before that date
none of the eligibility re-
quirements for GSLs was based
on income.

The previous requirements
were full-time enrollment of the
applicant in an eligible institu-
tion, and state residency.
Students were not required to
demonstrate financial need.

The Director of Student
Financial Aid Michael D. Bar-
tini said last week, ‘‘The Oc-
tober 1 change will not have a
significant impact on students
during the 1981-82 school year,
since more than 90 percent of
this year’s Guaranteed Student
Loans have already been pro-
cessed.”’ Next year will be dif-
ferent. Bartini estimates that at

least 40 percent of the students
who received GSLs this year
will not be eligible next year.
This means that roughly 250 to
350 W&L undergraduates and
law students will be affected by
the new rule.

Fund Drive

by Patrick Jordan

The final phase of Washington
& Lee University’s 10 year
development program will end
December 31 with contributions
exceeding the $62 million goal.

According to Carter
McNeese, Associate Director of
Washington & Lee Develop-
ment, a self study was con-
ducted in the late 1960s. by the
university to determine what
needed to be spent to improve
the school.

By 1972, a two-part program
was formulated with a $36
million dollar contribution goal
by 1976 and an additional $20
million projection by 1979.

However, McNeese said con-
struction costs on projects like
the renovation of Tucker, Mc-
Cormick and Newcomb Halls
and the costs incurred in
building the law school and the
Warner Center were greater
than anticipated.

McNeese said the university
then decided to extend the se~
cond phase until December 31,
1981 with a new goal of $62-
million in contributions.

The rule requires students
whose family’s income is over
$30,000 to demonstrate a need
for financial aid. Need will be
defined by a standard formula.
The student’s ability to pay is

this figure ($62-million) will be
reached,’”’ said McNeese. “J

ment on Sigma Nu’s financial
problems, feeling that it was in-
appropriate for him to make a
statement.

Last spring matters began to
get out of hand.

Finances accumulated and
the university asked the SNUs
to get their house matters
straightened. The Student Af-
fairs Committee came close to
kicking out the Sigma Nu
Chapter. Consequently, in what
has been described by one
brother as a ‘‘coup d’etat,”’ new
officers were elected and began
to pull things around. The
elected officers are _ Bill
Dedrick, president; Chris
Stokes, vice-president; and
John Solitario, treasurer.

The university has had five
basic complaints about Sigma
Nu since last spring.

The problems are: house
dissension, financial debt to the
university, the lack of a faculty

adviser, complaints from Phi
Delta Theta that Sigma Nu
members had been throwing
bottles across the street and a
low-ranking house grade-poin!
average.

In a May 12 letter from Deai
of Students Lewis John t
Sigma Nu president Bi!
Dederick, the  universit:
notified the fraternity that the
Student Affairs Committee hac
placed it on Fraternity Proba-
tion as of June 8 for one year.

In addition, SAC provided
Stipulations that Sigma Nu
must abide by the decision to re-
main on campus. The decision
stated that an oversight com-
mittee must be found; that the
chapter pay in full all its past
financial obligations while re-
maining current with mortgage
payments; that the chapter not
be permitted to live or eat in the
fraternity house; that the

Saying they were pleased
with voter turnout, the Ex-
ecutive committee announced
that three constitutional revi-
sions had been passed by the
student body in a three day
referendum.

Students cast 1013 ballots,
representing 62 percent of the
undergraduate and law school
population. The constitution
provides that 50 percent of the
school must vote, and that each
revision receive a two-thirds
majority, to pass a proposal.

Proposals 4, 5 and 6 were
passed. The fourth moves law

week of the term, instead of the
third week of October.

Revision no. 5 specifies the
date of the end of a represen-
tative’s term as the commence-
ment date of his school. Revi-
sion 6 clarifies the language
describing the president’s
power to call a meeting of the
student body.

Although the E.C. acknowl-
edged that the revisions that
would give the E.C. powers of
review over the Publications
Board had failed, the balloting
on other proposals had not been
tallied by Wednesday.

EC May Establish Telephone Co-op

by Todd Smith

Morgan Griffith, ’82L Rep.,
spoke of establishing a commit-
tee that would guarantee stu-
dent telephone bills, thereby
eliminating the need for $50
deposit, at Monday night’s Ex-
ecutive Committee meeting.

The Committee also heard the
report of the Computer Club,
dealt with the University Com-
mittee and ‘‘Who’s Who’”’ nomi-
nations, and transferred their
reserves to a money market ac-
count.

Griffith told the committee of
a cooperative at the University
of Virginia in Charlottesville
that freed its members from the
obligation of putting down a
deposit when a telephone is pur-
chased.

Members would pay $5 - $10 to

belong to the organization,
which Griffith said would be
similar to the present Cold
Check Committee.

Fraternities at U.Va. can join
the co-op for $30, reported
President Eric Myers. The cost
of membership in any
Washington & Lee co-op is sub-
ject to debate.

The fund created by member-
ship fees, charged once a year,
would form a pool that would
reimburse the Central Tele-
phone Co. if a student failed to
pay his bill.

Transcripts could be withheld
if a senior failed to pay his bill,
Myers postulated.

Centel’s representative was
enthusiastic about the idea,
reported Griffith. “You could
see promotion in his eyes,’’ jok-

ed the third year law represen-
tative.

“There would be a lot of
paperwork involved,’’ said
Myers. “If we could carry this
out it would be one of the big-
gest services we could provide
the students.”’

After the first deposit a stu-
dent has a good credit rating
and need not pay deposits in the
future, said John Vlahoplus, ’83
Rep. The co-op would ‘‘just be
delaying the inevitable for some
people,’’ Viahoplus suggested.

Since a credit rating does not
improve if a student fails to pay
his bill, and because some
students who paid their bills
regularly on a hall phone not
listed in their name received no
credit at the telephone com-

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

SNU’s Rescue

And so at the eleventh hour, Sigma Nu was rescued
from the fire and delivered into the land of promise —
a promise that the Sigma Nu national chapter,
located conveniently in Lexington, will help
guarantee through a renovation of the house.

Considering the location of the SNU Lodge, the na-
tional chapter’s action saved the university from an
embarrassing situation. SNU, as most everyone
knows, is located in Red Square and is thus visible
from the Colonade or Lee Chapel. Imagine the in-
dignation of a tourist whose first image of Washington
and Lee is that of a red-brick fraternity full of
punched-out windows, shotgun-blasted doors, and a
front lawn full of beer bottles.

Fortunately, a few members of SNU had the good
sense to realize that their house was not long for the
world. Through a little reorganization, a little prod-
ding from the university (actually, a few direct
threats) and some pledges from the national chapter,
the SNU Lodge may have a future.

The university has demonstrated in this episode
that it will not follow a policy of laissez faire when one
of its fraternities is in trouble. Almost everyone
knows that fraternities are the bloodline of W&L’s
social life. The university does not want this social life
to decay — thus, the interest in keeping SNU afloat.

It was a long struggle for both the university and

the SNU Lodge, but some strong-arm tactics from
Nashington Hall and aid from its national chapter
nave extended Sigma Nu’s life at Washington and
Lee. One wonders if other fraternities will be as for-

tunate if they wind up in SNU’s predicament.

No More Loans?

From the Office of Financial Aid comes the alarm-
ing news that student loans will be harder to come by
in the future. Yes, all those recipients of loans who
voted for Ronald Reagan can expect a backlash that
may force them to withdraw from this private institu-
tion. Under the new regulation, students whose
parents earn more than $30,000 a year will find it
harder to get a loan from the university.

The new regulation has both its good and bad
points. Ideally, the regulation will cut back on the
amount of affluent students who take out loans only to
turn them into money-market certificates or
Treasury Bills.

Unfortunately, $30,000, after taxation and inflation,
is not such a lofty figure. The cost of a year of school
at Washington and Lee for two students amounts to
almost 50 percent of the $30,000 figure.

Washington and Lee students are known for their
rather conservative views. It is ironic that some
students may be forced out of attending the college of
their choice because of these conservative fiscal

policies.

College is viewed by some as a way to escape the
harsh facts of the real world. This change in the
availability of Guaranteed Student Loans is but one of
these facts.

Law Student Nukes The Phi

Dear Sir:

I read with interest your
editorial concerning the pro-
posed adoption of Amendment
Seven (giving the Executive
Committee powers of review
over student publications) ap-
pearing in your Oct. 15 issue. I
was especially intrigued by
your characterization of the
proposed amendment as the
replacement of professionals
(presumably, the editorial
board of the Phi) by amateurs
(presumably, the members of
the E.C.).

While I do not wish to express
an opinion to the advisability of
the adoption of Amendment
Seven, I cannot resist the oppor-
tuniity to comment on your
claim to ‘‘professionalism.’’ I
ask you, was it a group of
‘professionals’? who approved
for publication your Sept. 17 ad
fpr McCrum’s Drug Store, con-
taining a special deal on certain
prophylactics? Similarly, was it
a group of ‘‘professionals’’ who
approved for publication the by-
line appearing over Mr.
Amsler’s letter concerning that
ad which stated frankly, if in-
correctly, ‘‘Burned About Rub-
bers?”’ Or, on another note, was
it a group of ‘professionals’

W&L Alumni Conference
Will Discuss Goals

by Patrick Jordan

A special conference for
Washington & Lee alumni to
discuss university goals and
procedures will take place to-
day and Friday.

According to Bill Washburn,
Alumni Secretary, 96 alumni
and their wives were invited to
the 11th annual meeting to ex-
amine the university’s financial

Situation, admission’s pro-
cedures and curriculum.
Washburn said _ invitations

were sent to the presidents of all
organized Washington & Lee
alumni chapters in the country
urging them to attend the con-
ference or if they had been
before to refer ‘“‘one or two
other alumni from their chapter
who would serve as excellent
ambassadors.”’

“The philosophy behind the
gatherings,’’ said Washburn,
“is that any alumnus can be
most beneficial to the universi-
ty when he knows a lot about
a

Washburn added the best way
to accomplish this is to invite
the alumni back to the school
for ‘‘intensive instructional ses-
sions about Washington & Lee
University.”

Washburn noted that the
“instructional sessions” are
designed for alumni feedback
and imput.

According to Washburn, the
wives of the alumni are quite
often the most opinionated, par-

Computers

To Help

Research

by Tom Baker

Taking advantage of com-
puter services being offered by
publishers, Washington & Lee
has acquired a program that is
designed to help students and
faculty involved in gathering
sources for extensive research.
The new program is actually an
information retinienal system
called Tialog. which is current-
ly being marketed by Lockheed.

According to Richard Grefe,
an assistant librarian, the pro-
gram is designed to put biblio-
graphic information that or-
dinarily appears in bound bib-
liographic indexes into data
bases in a computer.

The advantage of this system
is that students working on sub-
jects that require recently
published information do not
have to wait for publishers and
print indexes, a process that
can take months, to have a bib-
liographic citation of an article.

Publishers simply enter the
citations into data bases as soon
as the articles are printed.

(continued on page 10)

ticularly concerning matters
such as co-education.

Washburn said the two-day
sessions will concentrate on
four main topics entitled:
“University Finances Develop-
ment and Alumni Affairs,”
“Teaching at Washington and
Lee,” ‘‘Admissions, Student
Recruitment and Student Life,”
and ‘‘Athletics.”’

In addition to the meetings,
banquets are planned in Evans
Dining Hall both Thursday and
Friday nights for the alumni.

Washburn said the trustees,
who are also meeting this
weekend, are giving the Friday
banquet with a_ special
ceremony to honor three retir-
ing university trustees.

Engraving Missing

by Craig Narins
Last Friday morning, an
engraving by William Blake
was discovered missing from
Payne Hall. The engraving, a
representation of Chaucer’s
Canterbury Pilgrims has been
with the school for as long as

anyone can remember.
Although it had no real intrin-
sic value, the engraving was,
according to English professor
Sidney Coulling, ‘‘a part of the
tradition of the department.”
This was so partly because it
combined the work of two great
Englishmen, Blake and Geof-

frey Chaucer. Blake, who lived
from 1757 to 1827, is today con-
sidered one of England’s major
poets and most inspired artists.

The engraving, which hung on
the third floor of Payne, was
referred to by Dr. Coulling as a
“sitting duck” for anyone who
wanted to take it. The building
remains open all night long, and
the engraving was not really
protected in any way. Although
there is presently no evidence’
as to who took the engraving,
Coulling expressed hope that
the person who has it will return
it.

Natural Gas Costs
Certain To Increase

by Philip Murray

Natural gas costs will almost
certainly increase over the next
few years. It is impossible to
say exactly when or how much,
according to June Nicely, ac-
counting clerk at the Lexington
office of Columbia Gas of
Virginia.

Lexington customers of Col-
umbia Gas will already find an
approximately 20 percent in-
crease in their bills next month.
In addition, Columbia Gas is
seeking a 4.2 percent rate in-
crease from the State Corpora-
tion Commission.

Nicely said Columbia should
get the increase approved
sometime this week and im-
plementation will go into effect
in two or three months.

The 20 percent increase was
brought about by an increase in
the price of the gas purchased
by Columbia Gas for distribu-
tion. Ms. Nicely said rates vary
monthly depending on the cur-
rent price of gas.

Moreover, the price of
natural gas will continue to rise
through 1985 when the decontrol
of gas will be complete. This is
the first major jump in price
since the Natural Gas Policy
Act was passed in 1978.

Under this Act controls on the
wellhead price of newly
discovered gas are to be phased
out by 1985, but the controls re-
main on the about 40 percent of
gas already flowing which has
previously been found.

The purpose of the Act was to
narrow the gap between gas
and oil prices. However, in 1978
the price of crude oil was about
$15 a barrel. The current world
price is about $36. '

Nicely said that Columbia
Gas could not predict when
these price increases will take
place and how much they will
be. ‘The Federal Power Com-
mission is supervising the
decontrol process,”’ she said.

But Nicely said that their
studies show that gas will re-
main the most inexpensive
home heating fuel through this
century.

Commentary :

The Effects Of A
Rushed-Up Rush

by Scott Mason

I think regret is the best way to describe what I felt as I watched
the young freshman facing me struggle with words which would not
come and fight the tears that had already begun to fill his eyes,
regret not only for the emotion-stricken freshman who sat before
me, but for all freshmen who become entangled within the sorely
governed Rush system.

Despite what the ‘“‘Animal Houses’’ of America portray or what
ardent critics may claim, fraternities serve as one of the most im
portant institutions to literally thousands of men throughout the
country. Not only, in most cases, do fraternities bring a group of
men together in a common bond of brotherhood for a four year
period (often guffawed at by those who have never experienced
fraternity life), but this bond remains sealed throughout post-
college years as well. The relations among fraternity brothers are
often life-long relations, equal in strength and friendship to no
others. As a result, choosing which fraternity to join can be one oi
the most important decisions any individual has to make.

Why, then, the W&L (inter-fraternity council) chooses to begin
Rush upon the very first day’s arrival of freshmen seems to me an
astounding absurdity. Most freshmen are naive, confused, and ner-
vous, though eager, to begin their college careers. For many it
means the first time living away from the shelter of home, and for
all it means the arrival to an entirely new yet strange atmosphere,
an atmosphere which requires a certain degree of adaptation.

Understandably, Rush is a time of excitement, a time when
freshmen are able to meet other freshmen and upperclassmen as
well, while simultaneously (reviewing) individual houses.
However, too many freshmen become lost in this excitement and in
the immediate~bombardment of pressure which fraternities
unavoidably assert as a means of cajoling freshmen into ‘‘tearing.”
Yet even before all the commotion begins, freshmen must initially
eliminate seven of the seventeen fraternities which they choose to
visit, and this choice is made simply at random. Because freshmen
never have a chance to look at fraternities before Rush begins, they
have virtually no means of knowing which are most apt to coincide
with (each individual freshman’s likes). And during the three-week
melee, in addition to constant pressure, freshmen are subject to a
complete fake sense of reality which fraternities portray in the
hopes of gaining ‘‘pledges.”’ As a result, freshmen may join a house
disillusioned only to find out later, too much later, what the
house really has to offer.

And so it was with the freshman who sat before me with his head
in his hands and his eyes cast down to the ground attempting to tell
me of the mistake he had made. ‘“‘Too much excitement,”’ ‘‘just a
gut feeling,” ‘‘I...I can’t explain” were the broken phrases he ut-
tered in his fight to hold off the tears. I could sympathize, through
my own personal experience, with the ordeal he was going through
of depledging and respected this freshman for owning up to his
mistake. It is an ordeal which no freshman should have to suffer,
but with the Rush system the way it is, many do. Sadly, what’s
more, some refuse to recognize their mistake and may never really
enjoy their four-year tenure at W&L. As I viewed this particular
freshman, I was moved with pity. It is, indeed, a harsh state to see
a person agonize so, and even more harsh to realize his suffering
was needlessly due to a Rush system which cheats every freshman
out of an ample opportunity to choose a fraternity. It is more than
just a horrible shame. It is a bitter tragedy.

City Traffic Signal Moved;
Other Projects Completed

by Frank Jackman

The Lexington Public Works
Department moved the traffic
light on the corner of Main
Street and Nelson Street back
four feet last week in an at-
tempt to save the city money
and department work crews the
trouble of replacing it.

According to Public Works
Department Director David
Woody, the traffic light on the
East Nelson Street side of Main
Street has been knocked down
three times since August 1. At
one point it was knocked down
twice in one week. Woody

estimated that the light has
been knocked down 12 times in
the last five or six years.

It is usually large tractor
trailers trying to cut the corner
too sharp when making a right
turn onto Main Street that hit
the light, Woody said. About a
week ago, department work
crews moved the light back four
feet from the sidewalk in an at-
tempt to remedy the situation,
according to Woody. ‘‘Someone
will still find a way to knock it
over,’ Woody added.

The Public Works Depart-
ment is just finishing up work

on White Street, Woody said.
Work crews leveled off an 18
inch crown in the road between
Jackson Avenue and Jefferson
Street, according to Woody.
Work crews are also repairing
some sidewalks in the area,
Woody added.

Finally, the department will
conduct a practice run of the ci-
ty’s snow removal equipment
sometime in the next two weeks
according to Woody. Two years
ago it snowed in this area on
Oct. 10, catching state and local
officials off guard.

Entertainment
The Hills Are Alive

by Carren O. Kaston

Washington & Lee Universi-
ty’s Japanese Film Series,
sponsored by the East Asian
Studies Program, presents its
‘third movie, The Sound of the
Mountain, on Monday, October
26. The movie will be shown at 8
p.m, in classroom “‘A’’ of Lewis
Hall, the W&L law school, free
of charge. The public is invited.

The Sound of the Mountain (96
minutes) was directed in 1954
by Mikio Naruse. It is based on
the 1949 novel Yana No Oto by
Yasunari Kawabata, who won
the Nobel Prize for Literature
in 1968. Kawabata _ initially
hoped to become a painter, an
aspiration which is evident in
his novels, but his first stories
were published while he was
still in high school, and he then
decided to become a writer. He
is one of the few contemporary
Japanese authors to appear
with frequency in print in the
West.

The Sound of the Mountain
was the first novel by Kawabata
to be translated into English
after he was awarded the Nobel
Prize. It concerns a large ex-

-Film Notes

tended family, living in a
suburb of Tokyo, and the en-
tanglements across the genera-
tions of the members of this
family, especially the long-
suffering young wife Kikuko
and her father-in-law Shingo. It
is Shingo who hears ‘“‘the sound
of the mountain,” the faint rum-
ble in the hills that hints at
unknown occurrences, _in-
cluding dissolution and, per-
haps, death. The novel thus
places real, immediate, and
tangible events in a dreamlike
symbolic realm.

The career of Mikio Naruse,
the director of the film based on
Kawabata’s novel, embodies
the double heritage of Japanese
and Western culture typical of
Japan in this century and,
especially, after World War II.
Naruse favors understated por-
trayals of modern life. The
Sound of the Mountain falls into
the Japanese cinematic sub-
genre of the “wife-picture,’’ a
postwar mode generally con-
cerned with the struggles of a
wife for her identity in a society
which has for centuries taught
her only self-sacrifice.

 

Mr. Mike’s Mondo Video (1977) Originally made tor television but

cancelled at the last minute due to tastelessness, something pretty
rare for that medium. Written and directed by Michael
O'Donoghue of the original Saturday Night Live; he is perhaps best
remembered for an Uncle Remus skit with Garrett Morris and do-
ing imitations of Mike Douglas sticking needles in his eyes. Mondo
Video, which was universally panned, features SNL’s Jane, Lar-
raine and Gilda and a feline swimming contest. Shown by the SAB
this weekend; admission is $1.

Potemkin (1925) One of the masterpieces of cinema, directed in
the Soviet Union by Sergei Eisenstein with ground breaking use of
montage and editing for dramatic effect. This depicts the
repressive treatment of the masses by the regime in pre-Soviet
Russia, leading up to a major battle. Still riveting. The staircase
scene is unreal. Shown by the Journalism department Tuesday at 7
p.m. and9 p.m.

Charles Bracelen Flood,
author of a new book on Robert

The public is invited to attend
the reception which coincides
with the publishing of Flood’s
volume, ‘‘Lee: The Last
Years.”’

While researching the book,
Flood spent a great deal of time
on the Washington & Lee cam-
pus and included many photo-
graphs from the university’s
collection in his book.

 

“Lee: The Last Years” deals
principally with Lee’s presiden-
cy of Washington College (now

and his role as the prime healer
of the bitterness between North
and South after the Civil War.

Advance reviews have hailed
“Lee: The Last Years’’ as an in-
valuable contribution to the
body of Lee Scholarship.

One reviewer called the book
‘a masterpiece of narrative
biography.’’ Author Theodore
H. White commented: ‘Tragic
and powerful, with the rhythm
of a classic, the stupendous

‘‘Publisher’s Weekly’’
praised Flood’s ‘‘graceful style
and novelist’s eye for telling
details’ which ‘make this
dramatic recreation of the last
five years of Robert E. Lee a
joy toread.”’

Flood is a resident of Rich-
mond, Ky., and author of nine
books, including the best-selling
“Love Is a Bridge,’ ‘‘More

When You're Hot...

by Todd Jones

In the summer, things
get very hot. When the
temperature gets hot,
people sometimes do
things they later regret.
Murder is one of these
things. Body Heat is a
movie which deals with
the passion, desire, and
love of money that can be
intensified when people
stop thinking and let
other things take over.

Body Heat stars
William Hurt and
Kathleen Turner. Hurt is
a lawyer in a small town
in Florida. Turner is a
very beautiful wife of a
very, very rich man. A
man (Richard Crenna)
whom she despises. Hurt
and Turner meet at a
concert out in the hot
summer evening. The
two talk for a little while,
exchange innuendos, and
leave. Hurt decides to
search for her, and finds
her alone in a bar near
Miami. Naturally, they
end up in the bedroom,
but the line that Hurt
uses is surely an _ in-
teresting one (‘‘Can I go
over to your place and
see your wind
chimes?”’). We find out
that Kathleen is not only
insatiable in terms of her
sexual drive, but in her
greed for riches as well.
She and Hurt decide to
kill her husband, who
seems to have ties with
the Mafia. They are suc-
cessful, but clumsy. It
appears, though, they
will get away with the

crime.
However, strange
things begin to happen.
Important clues are be-
ing offered to the police,

but not delivered. The

police, as well as the in-
vestigator for the in-
vestigation into the death
of the rich husband, are
friends of Hurt. They
realize that Hurt was the
murderer, and are trying
to keep him from going to
prison by not accepting
these clues. However,
they cannot hold out
forever. This does not
especially bother Hurt,
but when his bedmate
(Kathleen) starts lying to
him, leaving town a great
deal, and playing around
with explosives (the
method involved in the
killing of the husband),
he becomes a little ner-
vous.

When Hurt is told to go
to her mansion, finds it
empty, but is standing in
front of a door in the
mansion which might be
triggered to dynamite, he
reaches the climax on
which the film is based;
does ‘Kathleen feel

stronger about her love
for him or would she
rather be free, in another
country, and very, very
rich?

Body Heat does not on-
ly have an interesting
plot, but also some of the
best direction I’ve seen
this year. Unusual
lighting, different
camera angles, and good
editing adds an extra ele-
ment of suspense to this
already chilling movie.

Director Lawrence
Kasden did an excellent
job.

William Hurt does a
pretty good job in his
role. He is, however,
completely overshadow-
ed by Kathleen Turner in
their scenes together.
Her characterization of a
greedy person who can
never get enough sex,
money, or power, is very
effective. Ted Danson
also puts in a good perfor-
mance as_ Lowenstein,
Hurt’s tap dancing, joke-

cracking, homosexual
friend.
Body Heat will hold the

interest of most movie-
goers for the entire

citing plot, good acting,

and excellent directing =
make this a film worth %

seeing.

Review:

 

Leon Bates

by Jim Baldwin

It is a rare occasion when one
hears a pianist like Leon Bates.
His concert Monday night in
Lee Chapel demonstrated his
ability to perform the most dif-
ficult works with both technical
excellence and artistic sen-
sitivity. Choosing the music of
Mozart, Schubert, Ravel, Rach-
maninoff and Chopin, Bates
provided a varied yet cohesive
program for his audience.

His smooth and expressive
renditions of both a Fantasie by
Mozart and two Impromptus by
Schubert were excellent, but
Gaspard de la Nuit by Ravel,
the most difficult work Bates
performed, was especially suc-
cessful through beautifully con-
trolled dynamics and smooth
execution of the most com-
plicated passages. The Etude
Tableaux of Rachmaninoff and
Chopin’s Sonata No. 2 were
equally impressive in their uni-
ty and effortless execution.
Bates also performed two en-
cores — one by Rachmaninoff
and the second by Mendelssohn.
The concert was truly enjoyable
and a rare opportunity to hear a

fine concert pianist.

Generals Hold O

by Dale Park

The Washington & Lee varsi-
ty football team ruined ODAC
rival Hampden-Sydney’s Home-
coming weekend for a second
Straight time as the Generals
handed the Tigers a 7-6 defeat.

W&L had defeated H-SC 20-0
two years ago at the Tiger
Homecoming, yet this year’s
contest saw much less scoring
by the Generals and much more
defense by both teams.

W&L took a 7-0 lead late in the
second quarter when soph-
omore quarterback Al Paradise
scrambled four yards for his
fourth touchdown run of the
year and junior Bill Devine add-
ed the extra point.

The score remained 7-0 until
late in the fourth quarter. With
only 3:14 left to play in the game
Tiger quarterback Tim Lass

threw twelve yards to wide-
receiver Brad Barlow for the
score. H-SC elected to go for the:
win and not the tie — but their:
two-point conversion pass at-
tempt fell incomplete.
Following the kick-off, the
Generals collected a pair of
first downs to run out the clock.
Commenting on the gradual
improvement of his defense,
head coach Gary Fallon noted:
“We've been putting our
defense on the field a lot these
past two weeks, but the players
have responded well by protect-
ing leads and securing wins. I

The Washington & Lee soccer
team snapped a three game los-
ing skid last Thursday by play-
ing Gettysburg College to a 1-1
tie. This left the Generals 3-4-1
prior to yesterday’s home game
with Roanoke College.

Head coach Rolf Piranian
believes that W&L controlled
Gettysburg after halftime. ‘“We
had a good second half and then
had the better chances in both
overtimes to win. The first half,
though, was really sloppy; I
was disappointed with the way
we played up to that point.”

Gettysburg got its goal late in
the first half. Bill Brown evened
it up for W&L one miuute into
the second half on an assist
from Mark Sullivan.

junior Mark Carduner shared

tell our players that it’s defense
which wins games.”’

The W&L—H-SC contest con-
tained 19 punts and only 227
total offensive yards between
the two teams. The win lifted
W&L’s ODAC record to 3-1 and
dropped Hampden-Sydney’s
conference mark to 1-3.

Next week the Generals will
take their 4-2 overall record
down to Sewanee, Tennessee, to
take on the _ high-scoring
Sewanee Tigers (University of

the South). Last week Sewanee
romped over Baptist University
56-16, and U.S.’s current 5-1
record also includes a 71-14
clobbering of Fisk University
earlier in the year.

“Clearly, Sewanee has been
able to generate points this
season,” remarked Fallon. ‘“‘I’
must admit that we’re a bit in
awe over a team which puts up
this many points. While our
defense has already faced some
strong challenges, Sewanee
could be the biggest one so far.”’

Gindhart split the goaltending
duties.

Before yesterday’s game, tri-
captain Ben Muskin gave his
view of why the Generals have
slumped following an _ im-
pressive 9-4-0 mark last season.
“There’s been plenty of effort
and we’ve had a good plan of
how to approach each opponent.
We definitely can’t blame in-
juries because it’s been a while
since Jeff Lating and Brad
Poorman got hurt. The real

“The game should be highly
competitive not only from the
standpoint of the rivalry be-
tween the two schools but also
because the most recent games
we’ve had with them have been
decided by just one goal,” said
the coach.

ly at the same time. A few let-
downs have cost us some
games.”’ He adds that there
have not been any problems
with anyone having a bad at-
titude.

This Saturday the Generals
are scheduled to play the first of
just two home weekend contests
of the season when they take on
9-1-1 Messiah College at 2 p.m.
Piranian says that Messiah’s
record is not the result of a
weak schedule. ‘‘They’re every
bit as good as their record in-
dicates.”’

by Rick Swagler

Earlier this season, in a meet
against Mary Washington Col-
lege, Lynchburg College illegal-
ly ran an unattached man ac-
cording to the Mary Washington
coach, Rick Wagenaar.

Wagenaar said that a Lynch-
burg alumnus “paced (Lynch-
burg’s) number-three man for
the last four miles.’’ Wagenaar
Stated that in the same meet
“four Lynchburg spectators
stepped in front of (Mary
Washington’s) number one man
and forced him to a complete
stop.”

According to W&L’s assistant
cross-country coach, Paul
Thomson, Lynchburg tried to
run alumni in their meet with
W&L several weeks ago. This
attempt was thwarted, how-
ever, when W&L threatened to
withdraw if the alumni ran.
Thomson called the Lynchburg
tactics “bush league” and com-
plained, as did Wagenaar,
about the verbal abuse the run-
ners received from the Lynch-
burg fans.

Wagenaar said ‘(Mary
Washington) is never going to
run at Lynchburg again unless
it is absolutely necessary. If we
do run there, I’m going to have

‘an NCAA representative pre-

sent.”’
Not surprisingly, Lynch-
burg’s coach, Jack Toms,

denied that he ran alumni
against Mary Washington and
that he tried to run them
against W&L.

Coach Al Buehler, track
coach at Duke University end
chairman of the NCAA Track
and Field Rules Committee,
quotes the cross-country
rulebook as saying, ‘‘ ‘no aid or
assistance can be given a run-
ner from anyone directly or in-
directly: associated with that
team...’ which includes running
alongside the man.’’ The penal-
ty for this, according to
Buehler, is disqualification of
the runner who received the
aid.

Commenting on the spec-
tators stepping in front of the
Mary Washington runner,

Buehler said ‘‘The meet direc-
tor, in this case the Lynchburg
coach, is responsible for crowd

control, but verbal abuse does »

not tie in with this. The fans can <@

say whatever they want.”’

Buehler said that Wagenaar
“should have protested the #
meet.”’ Wagenaar, on the other §
hand, stated ‘‘We’re going to ,

use it (Lynchburg’s conduct) as

an incentive. We can’t wait ‘til #

State to run against them.”’

In reference to Lynchburg’s
“unethical conduct’? Coach
Buehler commented: ‘Well,
there are skunks
business.’’
Washington and Lee Cross
Country team rolled up its
largest winning margin of the
season this past Friday,- Oc-
tober 16, in a 18-40 win over
Bridgewater College. The
Generals who stand 5-2 on the
season, will travel to WEST
Virginia Tech this Saturday,
Oct. 24. Sophomore Angus
McBryde led the charge against
the Eagles, claiming first place
in 27 minutes, 37 seconds

Mermen 1-2 In Bucknell Tourney

by G. Bruce Potter

Facing their toughest com-
petition of the year following a
week of haphazard practices,
the Washington & Lee water
polo team (17-4) compiled a 1-2
record at the Bucknell Tourna-
ment last weekend.

The Generals easily dispatch-
ed Cornell, 16-8, in their first
game but then suffered losses to
Slippery Rock, 13-9, and Brown,
12-8. Slippery Rock finished se-
cond in the event, losing in the
final to the New York Athletic
Club. This makes the Rockets,
who have downed W&L three
times this season, the top col-
legiate team on the East Coast.
Brown and Bucknell tied for
third.

‘“‘We did what we had to do
—beat Cornell (W&L lost to Cor-
nell by six goals last year),’”’ ex-
plained Coach Page Remillard.
‘“‘We’re really happy that
although we were going to a na-
tionally prominent tournament,
we didn’t compromise our-
selves philosophically. We
believe in academics. Due to
papers and mid-term exams,
we did not have a single
workout last week with the en-
tire team, and several people
missed several days.”’

One of the Generals’ goals
this year is to accumulate a
team GPA of 3.0.

Remillard cited two other
problems that led to the losses.
Goalie Andy Gates only stopped
half of the shots against Slip-
pery Rock and 45 percent
against Brown. ‘‘Our goalies
are not making the big saves,”
said Remillard.

When Slippery Rock made an
offensive change against the
Generals, Remillard had the
choice of one of two defensive
switches. He chose the one that
fell right into Slippery Rock’s
offense. Although Erik Peter-
son tallied six times for the
Generals in that game, the
Rockets hole man (similar to a
center in basketball) countered
with seven goals.

The second quarter was the
decisive one in the Slippery
Rock match-up as the Rockets
outscored W&L, 4-1. However,
the Generals came out firing
against Brown and quickly
scored the first goal, only to sur-
render three goals in two
minutes to fall behind by three
at the end of the first quarter.

Sophomore co-captain Tim

Rock was outstanding in the
field, although his shooting was
off according to Remillard.
Peterson shot 59 percent to
score 16 goals for the three
games and is “developing some
consistency”’ said Remillard.
However, Rock is having pro-
blems overcoming situations
when he is double-teamed

The Generals will have to do
without Rand McClain at the se-
cond half of the Southern
League Tournament this
weekend in Richmond and pro-
bably at the state champion-
ships the following weekend.
The sophomore left campus for
personal reasons without telling
Remillard earlier this week,
missed two practices, and will
be benched one weekend for
each practice missed.

‘‘When you're doing as well as
we’re doing, you tend to become
complacent,’ said Remillard.
‘“‘We needed a Reggie Jackson-
type incident and this could be
it. I think the team will rally
around it.”’

While the W&L football team
was beating Hampden-Sydney
Saturday, there was another
violent game taking place. The
W&L rugby team travelled to
Farmville as well. The
Generals A squad fell, 20-4,
while the B team won, 4-0.

‘‘We were down by eight at the
half,” said Player-Coach Todd
Alexander. ‘“‘We came _ back
with a try in the second half but
that was when the mistakes set
in.”

A try is the rough equivalent
to a touchdown in football. It is
worth four points and the extra
point is kicked from the same
angle to the goal post at which
the player entered the end zone.
Field goals, worth three points,
are an additional method of

scoring.
“We have lots of  inex-
perience,” Alexander states.

“Basically, they capitalized on
our mistakes and we didn’t
capitalize on theirs.”’

“We really have about five

people out that have ever
played before,”’ commente
Herb Funson.

The team, comprised of 20-25
players, is divided into two
squads, the A unit and the B
unit. The A game is generally
thought to be the more impor-
tant match.

‘In rugby, everybody plays,’
said Alexander. “It’s not like
football, where you have a first
team.”’

The returning experienced
players inlcude Funson, Alex-
ander, Andy McClellan,
Spencer Dickinson, and Dave:
Cordell.

The ruggers have played only
one other match besides Satur-
day’s. The A team lost 23-4 to
Virginia Tech. The W&L club
will travel to the University of
Virginia this Saturday to play
their next match. With each
match, the club is gaining;
necessary experience.

“It'll start to look better
toward the end of the season,”
offered Funson.

Feldman, Nankin Win Trophy

Washington & Lee University
debaters Lee Feldman and Ken
Nankin were awarded a
quarterfinalist trophy at the
Pace University Debate Tour-
nament in New York City last
weekend.

Feldman, a sophomore from
North Miami Beach; Fla., and
Nankin, a freshman from Col-
umbia, S.C., finished ahead of
several of the more prestigious
debate teams on the North-
eastern debate circuit.

Nankin also was named the
eighth varsity speaker at the
annual Johns Hopkins Debate
Tournament in Baltimore, Md.,
recently. The debate was judg-
ed, in part, by members of the
Young Lawyers Section of the

203 N. MAIN ST.

Hours: Mon.-Fri. 9:00-6:00
Sat. 9:00-2:00

 

tion. Nankin’s achievement is
all the more impressive since
he won in the varsity division
although he is only a novice
debater as defined by tourna-
ment rules.

This year’s national debate
resolution is: ‘Resolved: That
the federal government should

significantly curtail the powers
of labor unions.’’ Washington &
Lee’s affirmative case is the
repeal of the Davis Bacon Act,
enacted during the New Deal
and felt by many economists
and politicians to be infla-
tionary, particularly in the
building trades industry.

Confrontation Erupts
Among Law Candidates

by Todd Smith
A debate among law students

| campaigning for the empty first

law representative’s seat on the
Executive Committee brought
an open challenge to the single-
sanction honor system, alleging
that it caused fear among
undergraduates.

Seven law freshmen contend-
ing for the vacant seat were
also questioned about the Inter-
Varsity Christian Fellowship
budget issue, and the need for a
first year E.C. election to be
held before the Student Bar
Association makes its budget
request.

Jim Green, who had challeng-
ed the other candidates to the
debate, suggested a Biennial
referendum (every other year)
for students to approve to
discard the single sanction that
rule mandates that all infrac-
tions of the honor system by
punished with removal from the
university.

Green also suggested that the
students vote on opening the
records of honor trials. ‘‘(The
honor cases) would provide a
catalogue of precedent to see if
the E.C. is following precedent
or is behaving in a whimsical
fashion.”’

“‘T think the single sanction is
fine as it stands,”’ stated Dona
Szak. She disagreed with the
opening of honor hearing
records. “If worse comes to
worse, and the accused has a
jury trial, then the student body
will know the facts.”

Booher pointed out that at
Dartmouth, a school with an
open honor system, some trials
were of a nature that required
closing them to the student
body. Although the Dartmouth
student government disciplines
with multiple penalties, the ef-
fect is that honor cases result in

expulsion for the convicted.

Responding to Green’s drop-
ped aside that undergraduates
are said to live in fear of the
E.C., candidate Greg Walker
said, ‘If the undergraduates or
others feel afraid of tbe E.C., I
think they themselves are hav-
ing problems with a stringent
system.” Approving the W&L
system, Walker added that
many who fear they will be rip-
ped off are those who take the
possessions of others.

Jim Forte, a graduate of W&L
and sitting in the audience, saic
that he had noticed the fear tha‘
comes from living under the
honor syStem, and suggestec
that there was a problem ii
Walker couldn’t see that fear.

“Is the answer that to the ma-
jority that if they can’t conform
they ought to transfer?” asked
Forte.

W&L alumnus candidate Jim
Faulk responded, “I know I
didn’t live in fear...You in this
room are living under the honor
system and you aren’t trembl-
ing.”

Jim Forte charged, “If you
think the E.C. will make
allowance for one mistake from
an honorable student, you’re
wrong. Most cases are dismiss-

ed for a lack-of evidence.” He.

then said that he knows of many
such cases.

Szak suggested that many
law students felt uncertainty
about the rules of plagiarism
and the possibility of making a
mistake.

“I don’t believe there is such
thing as an inadvertent honor
violation,’ stated Jamie Canup.
Others also rebutted the argu-
ment that a small error would
result in expulsion.

Responding to questions con-
cerning budgeting, Green said

that he felt religious organiza-
tions like the Inter-Varsity
Christian Fellowship should
fund themselves. He later said
that funds should be allocated
according to membership
numbers.

IVFC was denied financial
support by the E.C. because it
was allegedly exclusive and
religious by nature.

Szak rebutted Green anc
others, who said that W&L was
unsupported by state anc
therefore the ‘church and
state’ issue could be easily
shrugged off. She also question.
ed funds for any organization,
no matter how many members
it had, that was exclusive.

Candidate Tom Shepherd
disagreed: ‘“‘This is the human
quality of a small school’s
governing body: you have peo-
ple in there and they aren’t go-

-ing to adhere to a rigid set of

rules, and I don’t think they
should.”

“I think that if a group of
students have paid their money
they should get back their fair
share,” said Shepherd.

All the candidates echoed the
need for earlier representation.
One questioner stated that it
was impossible for students to
ascertain the honor of a can-
didate before an early election,
and asked if the budget hear-
ings could be put off instead.

The candidates agreed that it
was easier to move the election
than the budget hearings, con-
sidering the need for funds
before October.

They made that judgment
before the failure of a student
body referendum that would
have moved back the date.

They made that statemen!
before the students ratified the
change in dates by constitu-
tional referendum.

Ottenheimer Foundation Endows W&L Law School

The Ottenheimer Brothers
Foundation of Little Rock, Ark.,
has established a $25,000 en-
dowed scholarship fund for the
Washington & Lee University
School of Law.

Gus Ottenheimer, director of
Ottenheimer Brothers Founda-
tion, graduated from the W&L
law school in 1917. He and his
brother, Leonard, are in the in-
vestment and real estate
business in Little Rock.

The $25,000 endowment will
fund the Ottenheimer Brothers
Scholarship, which is to be
awarded annually toa W&L law
student from Arkansas.

The first Ottenheimer
Brothers Scholarship was
awarded in August to David
Herbert Pennington, a native of

Rock following his graduation
from W&L. He later moved to
Providence, R.I., where he
spent three years as vice presi-
dent of a business firm before
returning to Little Rock to enter
business with his _ brother,
Leonard.

The result was the Ot-
tenheimer Brothers Manufac-
turing Company, which manu-
factured ladies ready-to-wear
for about 30 years and
employed 800 workers when the
brothers sold out in 1955.

The Ottenheimer Brothers
continued its business ac-
tivities, including the develop-
ment of ‘Cloverdale,’ a sub-
division that opened up the
growth of southwest Little Rock
where the Ottenheimers built

“This gift ...will benefit deserving
students for many years to come.”

President Robert E.R. Huntley

Fayetteville, Ark. Pennington
graduated from the University
of Arkansas, where he majored
in political science and was
elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He
entered the W&L law school this
fall.

Announcing the university’s
receipt of the Ottenheimer
Brothers Foundation gift,
Washington & Lee president
Robert E.R. Huntley said: ‘‘We
are grateful for the generosity
the Ottenheimer Brothers
Foundation has shown in mak-
ing this gift, which will benefit
deserving students for many
years to come.”’

Gus Ottenheimer was 20
years old when he earned his
law degree from W&L. He prac-
ticed law for six years in Little

about 450 homes.

Ottenheimer Brothers re-
mains active in various kinds of
investments today in spite of
the brothers’ ages — Gus is 84,
Leonard is 89.

Gus Ottenheimer has long
been an avid supporter of
higher education. He was ex-
tremely active in the develop-
ment of the University of
Arkansas at Little Rock. In the
1950s, he was chairman of a
committee that recommended
changing Little Rock Junior
College to a four-year institu-
tion. After that was accomp-
lished in 1957, he headed a com-
mittee that recommended the
merger of the Little Rock
University with the University
of Arkansas; that plan was

adopted by the state legislature
In 1969.

In 1978, Gus Ottenheimer was
awarded an honorary doctor of
law degree by the University of
Arkansas at Little Rock. He is
currently a member of the Uni-
versity of Arkansas at Little
Rock’s Development Council.

Active in numerous civic ac-
tivities in Little Rock, Gus Ot-
tenheimer is past director of the
Arkansas Chamber of Com-

merce and past chairman of the
board of the Metropolitan Area
Planning Commission, and also
past president and chairman of
the board of Associated In-
dustries of Arkansas.

In 1935, Gus Ottenheimer
founded the Institute for Inter-
national Understanding which
later was adopted and spon-
sored by Rotary International.
The program developed an an-

nual attendance in excess of one
million which included ac-
tivities in Europe.

Gus Ottenheimer has been
listed in ‘‘Who’s Who in
America” for a number of
years. He was a director of the
National Association of Manu-
facturers for nine years, two of
which were by presidential ap-
pointment as a director-at-large
representing manufacturers in
all the states.

Audio-Visual Center, effective

Oct. 1, 1981.: Coleman is a
graduate of Radford College
and earned his M.L.S. degree
from the University of North
Carolina.

Dr. Richard W. Oram, Assis-
tant Professor and Special Col-

lections Librarian, effective
Sept. 1, 1981. Dr. Oram earned

There are over 140 data bases

Also, a student does not have
to spend the time going through
periodical indexes. The com-
puter lists the references and,
as the saying goes, what once
took hours and days is now done
in minutes.

Although this system is very
common among graduate pro-
grams, Grefe knows of very few
four-year liberal arts colleges
that have this facility.

The library is involved in a
promotional campaign to in-
form students and faculty about
the system. Although each in-

formation search is expensive,

costing from $40 — $300 per
hour, the library is doing sear-

New Regulation To Affect 40 Percent Of Loans

(continued from page 1)
determined by evaluating the
family’s income, assets, and
liabilities. The amount of aid a
student will then be eligible for
is the difference between a stu-
dent’s ability to pay and the cost
of education. Anyone who can-
not demonstrate an inability to
meet the cost of education will
not receive a loan. Those ap-
plicants whose family income is

below $30,000 will not have to
demonstrate need in order to
qualify.

In dollar terms, this means
W&L will receive next year
about $800,000 less in GSLs than
it did this year. The Financial
Aid Office has processed over
$2-million in GSL funds for the
1981-82 school year.

Bartini emphasized that there
are alternative sources of

EC Debates Phone
Co-op With CenTel

(continued from page 1)
pany, the co-op idea still seem-
ed viable to the committee.

The E.C. decided to recon-
sider the idea after it had been
researched further.

Lee Feldman and Jay
O’Brien reported that the com-
puter club had received the sup-
port of President Robert E.R.
Huntley.

“The president told us that he
felt it should be a mutually
shared obligation,’’ said
Feldman, ‘‘with the school pay-
ing for hardware items...and
the E.C. taking care of office
supplies, etc.”’

Vice President Jim Averett,
who had been ridiculed by the
E.C. at the Oct. 28 budget hear-
ing when he promised that he
would “personally go talk to
President Huntley,” said that
he had been expecting more in-
formation from the club before
going to the President, but the
club evidently went around
him.

The club did ask for
assistance in getting the Mock
Convention to lend them their
computer terminal which they
need for their daily ‘help ses-
sions.”’

Because no petitions were
submitted by freshmen seeking
a seat on the University Com-
mittee, President Myers sug-
gested that the E.C. appoint the
freshman class vice president
to the position, as Dean John
had suggested.

Averett asked why the vice
president should have the posi-
tion instead of the president.
Myers replied that it was an
equitable division of respon-
sibility, and the Committee ap-
proved, with Griffith opposing.

Ted McQuiston, ’84 Rep.,
questioned the effectiveness of
the University Committee, say-
ing that he had heard that the
U.C. did practically nothing.

Junior Averett and Frank
Smith, ’83 Rep., were appointed
to submit student nominations
to a ‘‘Who’s Who’’ selection
committee. ‘“‘Who’s Who Among
College Students’’ is a nation-
wide, annual publication.

After Smith reluctantly ac-
cepted the appointment, Ben
Hale, ’84 Rep., joked, ‘I pro-
mise we'll get you a quote in the
paper for it.”’

Hale and Averett reported
that Dean John would transfer
the E.C.’s reserve account
funds to a money market ac-
count leaving $1500 for every-
day use in the funding account.

Averett said that the penalty
from withdrawing from a
Dreyfus account, “‘really only a
glorified checking account,”
was minimal.

10-Year Plan May Raise

funds, and that students should
be aware of them. A new
federal program will allow
parents of students to obtain
guaranteed loans of up to $3,000
a year at 14 percent interest.
Repayment would begin 60 days
after the loan is issued. These
loans will be available through
local banks and other lending
agencies.

Bartini is optimistic. He ad-

vises students ‘‘to keep inform-
ed about Guaranteed Student
Loans by reading newspapers,
talking to lenders, and to the
Financial Aid Office.”’

“‘T will be able to tell you what
is going to be available,’’ is Bar-
tini’s offer.

The Oct. 1 change in GSL
eligibility requirements is a
direct result of the Reagan ad-
ministration’s federal budget

cuts. The U.S. Government
pays most of the interest on
these loans, and guarantees
them against default. The costs
to the government of subsidiz-
ing the low interest rates on
GSLs have become
astronomical in the last few
years. Bartini said of the
change in eligibility re-
quirements, ‘‘It is a reflection
of the times.”’

The contributions to the
university, said McNeese, come
from alumni, friends of the
university, corporations and
various foundations.

McNeese refused to comment
as to who the largest contri-
butors to the fund were but he
said it is well-known that Sidney
Lewis, owner of Best Product:
Corp., contributed $9-millior
towards construction of the
university law school.

McNeese said the money con
tributed to the university durin;
the 10-year development pro
gram is spent not only on im
proving university facilities
but also in lowering each stu
dent’s tuition by supportin;
Washington & Lee’s operating
budget.

McNeese said the actual cost
to educate each student is $7,000
but that each student receives
about $3,000 in endowment
benefits and various other con-
tributions from corporations
and foundations.

IFC president, the chapter’s
faculty advisor, and _ two
members each from Sigma
Nu’s National organization and
the Sigma Nu Alumni House
Corporation. This committee
meets with the chapter
monthly.

The stipulation concerning
the use of the fraternity house
resulted from a house inspec-
tion by Professor of Engineer-
ing Henry Ravenhorst, who
made a bad report about the liv-
ing conditions. Renovations
totalling $40,000 must be com-
pleted on the house before it can
come into use again.

Two meetings last week in-
volving the Lambda Chapter
and the Sigma Nu Nationals
resulted in a decision to turn to
receivership. This means that
the alumni and national cor-
poration now possess the power
to run the local chapter of
Sigma Nu.

While the chapter is now in
more secure hands, one disad-
vantage is that everything, in-
cluding social activities, is con-
trolled by the Nationals and the

alumni.

Thanks to this receivership,
Sigma Nu is back on its feet.
One alumnus, Charles Murphy,
plans to raise money and donate
it to the Lambda Chapter as
soon as he is content with the
way house affairs are handled.
This national alumni drive
would raise at least $50,000.

Although Sigma Nu fraternity
is turning things around this
year, it has lost seven
members, including the Rush
chairman and social chairman.
However, the fraternity has
received at least five pledges so
far this year.

Next year will be Sigma Nu’s
100th anniversary at Washing-
ton & Lee. The chapter is in a
rebuilding stage, trying not only
to turn around its problems, but
also its reputation. The Sigma
Nus had to deal with a great
disadvantage in this year’s
Rush because of bad-mouthing
concerning the fraternity. One
Sigma Nu member said, ‘‘The
university is looking to kick us
off at the smallest thing.”’

EC,IFC Clash Over Contact Funding |!

by Ed Gonsalves

The Interfraternity Council
refused a challenge by the Ex-
ecutive Committee Tuesday
night to contribute $9000 to Con-
tact, an increase of almost 100
percent over last year’s IFC ap-
propriation.

The Executive Committee,
reporting that: Contact is the
strongest committee system on
campus because of the speakers
it provides for students and
Lexington residents, issued the
challenge to Mike Drinkwater

and Robert McLean, Contact
co-chairmen.

According to Drinkwater, the
E.C. would have added $1000 to
its original Contact appropria-
tion of $10,000 if the IFC would
have increased their appropria-
tion $1500, from $7500 to $9000.

Contact, established in 1962
by the IFC as a gesture of good-
will to the City of Lexington, is
financed in part through appro-

_ priations from the E.C. and an

IFC assessment of fraternity
members.

Ballengee New Rector
Of Board Of Trustees

James M. Ballengee, a
leading Philadelphia business
executive, was elected rector of
Washington & Lee University’s
board of trustees during the
board meeting held on campus
last weekend.

Ballengee succeeds E. Mar-

shall Nuckols Jr., former senior .

vice president of Campbell Soup
Company, who retired from the
board. The position of rector is
the equivalent of chairman of
the board.

Two other members of the

Tuscaloosa, Ala. — also retired
and were honored during the
trustees’ meeting. Nuckols was
designated rector emeritus
while Mrs. Martin and Warner
became trustees emeriti.

Ballengee, the new rector, is
president and chairman of the
Enterra Corporation, a holding
company with 10 subsidiaries
and headquarters in Radnor,
Pa. A trustee of Washington &
Lee since 1978, he is a 1948 W&L
law graduate.

A native of Charleston,
W.Va., Ballengee practiced law
in his hometown for nine years
following his graduation from
W&L. In 1957, he became
associate counsel of Sears,
Roebuck & Company. He was
named general attorney and
assistant secretary of Sears,
Roebuck & Company in 1961 but

(continued on page 8)

The IFC agreed by a vote of
15-2 to increase its contribution
from last year’s fee of $4650 to

$7500. This money will be raised —
. by assessing each fraternity

member $9.05 (the total amount
of fraternity members divided
by $7500).

Each fraternity will pay a
sum equal to the number of its
members multiplied by the
$9.05 (e.g. a house with a
membership of 50 will be billed
$452.50, an increase of $200
more than last year).

Committee agreed to appro-

dent activity fee levied at the
beginning of each year. This

The Tables Are Turned,
The Hazing

Pledges Do

by Todd Smith

Fraternity kidnapping this
fall seems to be practiced less
on the freshman pledges than
by them.

Freshmen have abducted at
least three upperclassmen so
far from Pi Kappa Phi, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Chi.

Ted McQuiston, a sophomore
Pi Phi, was kidnapped by
freshman pledges Sunday, Oct.
18.

A nurse working the 4-12 shift
at the Student Health Center in
the basement of Davis Dor-
mitory found McQuiston in a
closet.

The closet adjoined a public

hallway where the cage door
was usually left open with an
unlocked padlock on it. The next
morning a custodian found a
sign, ‘‘Do not feed the
animals,”’ on the cage door.

MeQuiston had been in the
closet two to three hours when
nurse Clara Wilhoit found him
blindfolded and tightly bound at
the hands with an army belt.
According to nurses, he was
stunned and close to shock.

Bringing lemonade to calm
him down, Wilhoit had the juice
knocked out of her hands by
freshmen, who then carried Mc-
Quiston off again.

The Lexington Police Depart-
ment is still investigating how
one of its patrol cars mys-
teriously moved and hit a brick
wall Oct. 3.

Patrolman Torben Pedersen,
who was investigating the
Sigma Nu fraternity house at 4
Henry St. in Lexington when the
incident occurred, said the
police department suspects a
Washington & Lee University
student is responsible for the
mishap.

Pedersen was investigating
‘Sigma Nu for a noise violation.
He said he left his patrol car
unlocked in front of the fraterni-
ty, putting the car in park and
removing the keys from the ig-
nition. The policeman said he
went into the fraternity to close
down a band and when he
returned five minutes later he
found his car smashed against

the war memorial at the en-
trance of Washington & Lee
University.

Pedersen said _ several
students have come forward

saying they saw a student get
into the car and shift the patrol
car out of park. Pedersen said
none of them could identify the
student, however, they said he

was dressed in a
uniform.” ~~

The patrolman added the
mishap was also the result of a
mechanical failure in the
transmission of the car. Accor-
ding to him the car cannot be
shifted out of park unless the
key is in the ignition.

Pedersen said the police
department asked the universi-
ty to put all fraternities on
social probation until the
suspect came forward and cgn-

fessed. The university ad-
ministration refused to do so.

Pedersen said the person
responsible will be charged
with intentionally setting a
motor vehicle in motion and
destruction of public property.
He added the police department
will also pursue the case in civil
court to make the responsible
party pay for the damages.

Officer Investigated In
1977 Hop-In Theft

by David Ridlon

A Lexington police officer has
been suspended from duty pen-
ding an investigation into possi-
ble misconduct.

Officer Barry Flynt was
suspended from duty Wednes-
day morning as a result of an in-
ternal investigation by Lex-
ington Police Chief James Kir-
by. Kirby has called in the
Virginia State Police to conduct
their own investigation of the in-
cident.

The investigation centers
around the theft of $500 from the
Hop-In Food Store on North
Main Street in Lexington. The
theft occurred in June 1977 but
Kirby said he had just learned
about the theft last week when a
reporter from WDBJ, Channel-
Seven in Roanoke, called for
some information regarding the
incident.

Kirby said Flynt was
suspended in lieu of possible
“conduct unbecoming of a
police officer.’’ Kirby would not
comment further on the inci-
dent.

The Lexington Police Depart-
ment is waiting for the State
Police to finish its investigation
before conducting a personnel
hearing. In the personnel hear-
ing Chief Kirby will choose one
person to sjt on the review panel
and Officer Flynt will be allow-
ed to choose another person to
sit on the panel. These two
panel members will then choose
a third to sit with them, and
they will review the case. The
hearing is' expected to begin
within the next couple of weeks.

Flynt joined the Lexington
Police Department March 1,
1973.

 

 

Plaque Commemorating Academy

To Be Dedicated Saturday At Chi Psi

A plaque commemorating the
Ann Smith Academy, the Se-
cond oldest incorporated school
for girls in Virginia, will be for-
mally dedicated in ceremonies
at 11 a.m. Saturday on the steps
of ‘the building standing on
original school property now oc-
cupied by W&L’s chapter of Chi
Psi fraternity.

The plaque has been donated

by the local chapter of the
Association for the Preserva-
tion of Virginia Antiquities. Ac-'
cording to Mrs. Fred Hadsel,
president of the local APVA
chapter, the plaque is designed
“to keep before the public the
historic significance of this
building.’’
‘ The: original Ann Smith
Academy building was erected
by:a local board of trustees in
1808-09 on its present site at the
corner of Nelson Street and'Lee
Avenue.

Flood Honored Tomorrow

by B. Scott Tilley

Tomorrow from 4:00 until
5:30 p.m., Charles Flood will be
honored at a reception and
autograph party in the Univer-
sity Bookstore. The reception
will coincide with the publica-
tion of his book, ‘‘Lee: The Last
Years.”

The book deals with the five
years of Lee’s life after his sur-
render at Appomattox. This
time period includes his
presidency of Washington Col-
lege (now Washington and
Lee), and his role as prime
healer of bitterness between
North and South after the Civil
War.

Flood, whose book, ‘‘Rise,
and Fight Again’ won the
American Revolution Round
Table Award for the best book
on the Revolution published
during the Bicentennial year,
researched much of his book at
W&L and in the Lexington area.
“The Lee Papers” in the W&L
library contained much infor-
mation that has never been
published before. ‘‘They are
very valuable, THE source for
information on Lee’s last
years,” Flood said.

Flood also noted the impor-
tance of aid he received from
many individuals affiliated with
W&L. In particular, he ex-
pressed appreciation to Betty
Kondayan and Susan Koblantz
in the library, Professors Mer-
chant and Doyon, and Mary
Coulling. ‘“‘They were extreme-
ly helpful, far beyond what a
researcher could aa ” he
explained.

Flood felt that; his book
“covers Lee’s last five years
more extensively than any
biographer has covered it
before. No one has previously

 

, The last portrait of Lee during his lifetime. \

concluded how important his
contribution* was in rebuilding
the union. Ninety- -five percent
of all Americans believe Lee
vanished after Appomattox.”

It was this same lack of
knowledge that led Flood to
write the book. ‘Actually, I
would seem to be one of the
most unlikely; candidates to
write a book like this,’’ he ex-
plained. ‘‘My great-grandfather
was a Union Cavalry Sergeant
who was captured and held in
Andersonbille Prison. I was
born in Manhatten and lived in
the North until 6 years ago.”’

Flood’s book contains es
viously unpublished informa-
aoe cerning Lee’s attempts

bout Lee and his horse,
Teode and the founding of
Kappa Alpha fraternity. Among
other ‘novel material is a
touching letter from a former.

Civil War soldier who had lqst ©
an arm in the war asking Leé

about admission and tuition at
Washington College.

Autographed copies of “Lee:
The; Last Years’ will | be
available in the bookstore dur-
ing the reception for $14.95.

The former Anne Smith Academy, which is currently occupied by
Chi Psi fraternity, will be the site of a dedication ceremony on
Saturday.

In 1903, it was leased to the
town for a public school. When

the town: took charge, the
building was _ judged not to be
safe and wasiazed. The present

structure. was erected by the
town of’ on in 1909 and
was used as ..4 : public school
building. he

Abandonéd,,as a_ school
building in 1970, Washington
and Lee purchased the building
from the city in 1978 and
renovated it, maintaining the
exterior appearance to a max-
imum extent:

Taking part in the plaque
dedication will be Dr. George
Ray, professor of English at
Washington and Lee and faculty
adviser to the Chi Psi fraterni-
ty; Edward Gonsalves, W&L
senior and president of Chi Psi;
Henry Ravenhorst, professor of
engineering at W&L and the ar-
chitect in charge of the

building’s renovation; Mrs.
Hadsel of the APVA; and, Dr.
William W. Pusey III, dean
emeritus at W&L and a member
of the APVA.

The plaque will incorporate
text commemorating the entire
history of the building with an
illustration of the original
building. Immediately follow-
ing the ceremony the Chi Psi
house will be open for a tour of
what Mrs. Hadsel characterizes
as “‘an excellent example of a
renovated building being put to
a new purpose.”’

Mrs. Hadsel indicated that
Dr. Pusey was instrumental in
the APVA’s decision to erect a
plaque. ‘‘Dr. Pusey’s talk on the
Ann Smith Academy at an AP-
VA meeting is what spurred our
interest in the building,” she
said.

Foreign Students Find
Less Pressure At W&L

by Steve Warren

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity is ‘not gas competitive as
universitet Hong Kong and
Singaporé, ‘it*' the” students
here are more self-motivated
than they arg-abr qd; according
to foreign stydeats at W&L.

Seng Kah “Henry” Baey, a
regular student here, is from
Singapore. He says that the
main difference in competition
among universities is in the ex-
amination process. For W&L,
and other American colleges,
exams are held after each sem-
ester and the student’s ner-
vousness ends there. At univer-
sities in Singapore, a student
can expect to take a cumulative
exam at the end of each year-
long course. ‘There is intense
pressure on those,’’ Henry said.

Ping Wah ‘‘Feva”’ Lai, an ex-
change student from Hong
Kong, adds that there are also
competetive exams at each
level of entrance, such as col-
lege entrance and college
graduation exams. While
students here may complete a
degree by passing all required
courses, students at the two

universities in Hong Kong must

pass an additional exam before
they can graduate. This final:
examination can also be
cumulative.

How do these students find
Washington and Lee, in terms
of academics?

“There is more individual
motivation of students,’’ says
Feva. “‘That’s not to say the
students in Hong Kong are not;
it’s just that, here at W&L,
students-take education not just
for examinations. In Hong
Kong, the education ideology is
‘Education for those selected...’
because there are only two
universities there.”’

How do these students like the
all-male environment?

“I don’t like it,” said Henry.
“There is tremendous pressure
on the weekends, after studying
hard all week. Girls are looked
on for sex, or physical plea-
sures, rather than just as
friends, like you would call
someone up and say ‘How are
you...do you want to go out for a
mas *

As for Feva, he isn’t bothered
by it. He says that there are
enough Christian students here
to do things with.

A ‘Conflagration’ Presentation

by Carren O. Kaston

The wide-screen movie
Conflagration (Enjo), fourth in
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s Japanese Film Series, is
scheduled for Monday,
November 2, at 8 p.m. In a
departure from the customary
screening location for the
series, Conflagration will,
because of the width of the
print, be shown in duPont Hall.
The showing is free of charge
and open to the public.

Conflagration (96 minutes),
made in Japan in 1958, is the se-
cond film in the series to be
directed by Kon Ichikawa. (The
first was The Heart, made in
1955). Ichikawa’s movie is bas-
ed on Yukio Mishima’s 1956
novel Kinkakuji (The Temple of
the Golden Pavilion), which
concerns the true story of a
young Zen Buddhist acolyte
who in 1950 burned down the ex-
quisite, world-famous medieval
Zen temple in Kyoto called The
Golden Pavilion. Drawn to acts
of destruction, Mishima himself
committed suicide in 1972.

‘Mach One’

Here
Sunday

The United States Air Force
Rock Band Mach One will per-
form in Cameron Hall at the
Virginia Military Institute at 3
p.m. Sunday. The afternoon ap-
pearance is sponsored by VMI
and the Arnold Air Society, the
Air Force ROTC student club.
The performance is free of
charge, and the public is in-
vited.

Mach One is composed of five
professional musicians, all
members of the parent organ-
ization, the U.S. Air Force
Band. The program will consist
of popular rock tunes, including
some of the group’s arrange-
ments. It is led by Sergeant Ken
Buckery, USAF.

The appearance of Mach One
will be the first public use of the
new multi-purpose facility at
VMI. The concert preceeds by
one week the formal dedication
of the building on Nov. 6and7.

(For area radio stations: the
USAF Band will provide upon
request free Mach One LP
albums for Promotional Give-
aways to publicize the concert.
Contact Captain B. J. Stephen-
son, Jr., USAF, AFROTC, VMI,
463-6354. )

Both Mishima’s novel and
Ichikawa’s film explore the
character of a man impelled to
destroy what he most loves. He
is motivated by a desire to
purify the Pavilion of the
desecration of its use after
World War IL as a tourist attrac-
tion.

The pyromaniacal young man
may also be rebelling against
the forms and disciplines of the
Zen Buddhist way of life, which
has for generations laid its spell
on a whole range of national
behavior and culture, from
social etiquette to swordsman-
ship and judo, from theater
techniques to flower ar-
rangements, from garden
designs to archery, from the
formal tea ceremony to literary
styles and conventions.

But the young priest is also an
inveterate stutterer, an obsess-
ed son of tormenting parents.

Ichikawa’s film, an example of
the sub-genre known as the
‘home drama,”’ focuses on the
relationship between the young
man’s devastating family life
and his fanatical idealism. The
movie’s creative use of the wide
screen reinforces its textured
visual beauty and its striking

use of architecture.
The fifth and last movie in the
series will be Hiroshi

Teshigahara’s widely acclaim-
ed Woman in the Dunes (1964),
scheduled for November 9 at 8
p.m. inclassroom “‘A”’ of Lewis
Hall. The Japanese Film Series
is sponsored by the East Asian
Studies Program of Washington
and Lee. The films are made
available through the generosi-
ty of the Japan Foundation, and
are being shown here in con-
junction with the W&L course
‘Japanese Literature in
Translation.”

Film Notes

Trouble in Paradise (1932) A sophisticated comedy directed by
Ernst Lubis8tch, and his touch was never more apparent in this
story of jewel thieves and romance abroad. Featuring some of the
most elegant stars of the period, Herbert Marshall, Miriam
Hopkins and Kay Francis, gliding through a series of glittery sets.
It is difficult for modern audiences to understand Kay Francis’s
total personification of glamour in the immediate post-silent era. A
treat. Shown by the journalism department Tuesday evening at 7
and 9 p.m. in Reid Hall. Admission, of course, is free.

‘Mommie Dearest’,Or, A Woman’s Fayce

by John Wells

JOAN CRAWFORD’s name appears on the mar-
quee of the State Theater this week as it did fre-
quently from 1930 to 1960 and probably never will
again. For the first time, Crawford is the subject,
not the star, and this is clearly not a film bio in the
tradition of The Jolson Story.

Crawford’s death in 1977 made the front pages,
the loss of the ultimate movie queen. Her years as
a major box office attraction, from 1928 to 1956, re-
main unchallenged; she won her Academy Award
in 1945, years after most of her contemporaries —
Clara Bow, Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo —
had vanished permanently from the screen. The
fact of her durability is even more astounding
when one considers that all but a handful of her
movies were mediocre at best.

One month after Crawford’s death, the terms of
her will were announced. In it, she left nothing to
adopted children Christina and Christopher, ‘‘for
reasons well known to them.”

Hell hath no fury like a brat cut off.

Within two years, ‘‘Mommie Dearest”’ hit the
bookstands, filling Christina’s coffers with more
money than Crawford earned during her heyday.
To say the book is sensational is a gross
understatement. No one bothered to point out that
it was written by a disinherited, vindictive
daughter about a woman obviously unable to de-
fend herself, and that the gruesomest portions
could be attested to only by one or the other. The

tales were accepted as blind truth by a voracious -
public apparently enthralled at pulling down idols .''

for a good wallow in the mud.

After about a year on the tacky talk show cir-
cuit, Christina thankfully disappeared from public
view. Now Mommie Dearest is a top grossing
movie, and the whole sordid mess has once again
been thrust upon us.

Faye Dunaway has been made up to really look
like Crawford in still photographs. For all the
grease, though, the moving image is marred by a
flat face and a nose that isn’t quite right.
Crawford’s huge, luminescent eyes can’t be
duplicated, either. I found myself squinting to con-
jure the desired product; from some angles,
Dunaway looks like Yoko Ono in shoulder pads.

The casting of Dunaway is somewhat ap-
propriate; she, more than any current actress,
personifies stardom in the Crawford mold. But,
despite a faint resemblance, Crawford’s face has
merely been painted on Dunaway’s, resulting in
something uglier than either of them and a card-
board performance by Faye. She goes through no
fewer than two dozen wardrobe changes and hair-
dos, which help sustain a faltering image, and
Irene Sharaff’s costumes remain the most in-
teresting aspect of the picture.

 

MOVIE REVIEW

 

Mommie Dearest is ridden with other, non-cosmetic problems: a
weak script, undistinguished photography and numerous factual
errors. Dunaway’s performance does not carry the picture as it
might have. She’s obviously done her homework, nailing down
Crawford’s walk and mannerisms with stunning accuracy. But she
is inconsistent. She’ll open a scene with a perfect gesture and voice
modulated to sound just like Crawford’s. As the scene progresses,

however, she becomes Faye Dunaway again, and this hurts her in

Joan Crawford in 1940

the crucial (I should say excruciating) portions of the film, She
really tries, I think, but in the final analysis it just doesn’t come off.

To the credit of whoever did the casting, the child who
portrays Christina as ,a little girl is every bit as homely and
obnoxious-looking as old photographs of precious daughter
indicate. Instead of blossoming in adolesence she _ turns
into unattractive teenager Diana Scarwid, who adds nothing
to the part except to make Christina out to

-Crawford’s severe personal ‘problems as just

 

be the sweetest, most put upon thing you could im-
agine.

Worst scene: there are many, but the ‘No more
wire hangers” bit really takes the cake. Dunaway,
smeared with cold cream, carries on like
something wild (a local in the audience kept say-
ing “‘She’s a witch, she’s a witch...’’). The actual
beating is unrealistic, with closeups of the hanger
making contact and a concurrent sound effect that
sounds exactly like a slamming door. Other parts
are equally awful but more fun, including a
glorious scene in which Dunaway leaps on the
sullen, tow-headed Scarwid, sending a table and
lamp to the floor, and nearly choking the girl to
death in the presence of a reporter from Redbook. |
Come on!

Best scene: in later years, when Christina is
sick and 64-year-old Mommie voluntarily replaces
her on The Secret Storm. The scene where
Crawford buffaloes the Pepsi board of directors is |
pretty good as well, even though it is an invention |
of the writers.

Mommie Dearest is laughable, making anything |
seém possible. When Joan brings sweetie pie a gift |
after ‘they’ve moved to New York, one half-|
expects it to be the rare tenderloin Christina refus-
ed to eat for lunch 15 years before.

A troubling aspect of the film is that it treats |

|
|

 

desserts instead of reasons behind her alleged
child abuse. There are other minor omissions, |
like two other adopted children (who have |
repudiated Christina’s story) and two marriages.
Her 1955 marriage to Alfred Steele is grossly
misrepresented — according’ to the movie
Crawford drove him to an early grave because she |
wanted a fancier apartment.

The movie also fails to mention that she gave up |
drinking for religion in her last years, but how |
would Christina know? The only time she saw her

_mother after 1972 was in Campbell’s Funeral |
Parlor five years later. The bit about Christina
tearfully accepting a T.V. award for ‘Mommie
Dearest” near the end is pure hogwash.

The director, Frank Perry, .collaborated with |
producer Frank Yablans and two others on the
worthless script. The rest of the cast is absolutely |
without distinction. Mommie Dearest might have
been better if it had been done in the film noir
mode, in black and white, with lots of shadows and
period music. But it’s a sorry movie, and certainly
no worse than its trashy source.

Poor Joan — her stellar reputation may have
survived untarnished had she but thrown a few
shillings at the sniveling wench in her will. That
probably would just have stalled matters, though.
Time doesn’t slow the greedy who find success on-
ly by picking at the bones of the dead.

 

 

 

 

Outing Club Seeks Participants

   

This year, the W&L Outing
Club has a very new, different,
and exciting schedule.

With an adequate sum lent by
the E.C., the Outing Club can
venture beyond the realm of
merely ‘“‘camping out.”’

If jumping out of a plane is
your trip, the Outing Club can
help you to make a dive. If you
enjoy hiking, take some ropes
and the Outing Club will teach
you. how to scale and rapell as

well.
If your idea of an outing ac-

tivity is somewhat feasible, and
not too bizarre, the Outing Club

will consider it.

Man cannot conquer the
vastness of nature alone,
however, The Outing Club has
the important ingredient
necessary for W&L students to
truly enjoy the beauty of nature
itself — women.

Many outdoor activities are
planned with all the girls’
schools.

On November 7-8 there will be
an overnight back-packing trip
with Randolph-Macon at Mar-
ble Springs. On November
14-15, a canoe and hiking trip
with Hollins is scheduled.

The race for the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference is coming to a close and the standings will
hit the proverbial fan this Saturday.

Undefeated Randolph-Macon travels to 3-1-0
Maryville and will hopefully come away with their
first ODAC loss, which would close the focus only
to Maryville, W&L, and Randy-Mac.

Of the teams in the ODAC, Washington and Lee
has the best record after seven games (five wins
and two losses). Maryville and Randolph-Macon
both follow after only six games with 4-2-0 records.

What must not be overlooked though is 101
points while giving up 47 on defense. W&L has
compiled 55 points on offense to 48 given up on:
defense. Conceivably, the title could come down to
point standings.

have 108 yards on 367 attempts, averaging 154.4
yards per game. Hampden-Sydney ranks first

ODAC total-offense ranking with 3.7 yards per
play, amounting to 261 yards per game. Maryville
leads the conference with an impressive 26 points
per game. W&L is second, scoring 14 points a
game.

The Genérals’ defense is the stingiest in the con-
ference against the run, allowing a mere 129 yards

six touchdowns throughout the season’ Emory and

Henry is the only team better than the Generals
against the pass, statistically, averaging 115 yards
a game. The Generals have had nine in-
terceptions in the 130 attempted passes, 52 of
which were complete. W&L ranks first in total
defense giving up 242 total yards per game.

The Generals also make individual appearances
in the ODAC top spots. Chris Cavalline is second
only to Hampster Tim Jones in rushing. Cavalline
has covered 639 yards thus far in 193 carries. Five
of those efforts have ended in the end zone. He is
also fourth in overall scoring and fifth in punting
and receiving. :

Sophomore Al Paradise placed third this week
in the passing race, completing 50 of 96 efforts for
seven completions-a-game. A more vital statistic
is that Paradise has thrown only five interceptions
so far this season. Steve Corbeille is averaging 7.2
in punt returns, the fourth best in the conference..
Pat McGuire ranks first among kick returners,
averaging 20 yards each time he brings it out.

Despite 3-6-1 mark thus far, the worst overall
mark in the conference, the W&L Soccer Team is
third in conference competition (2-2) behind

_ Lynchburg and Hampden-Sydney. Sophomore;
Roland Simon is sixth in ODAC scoring. After 10:

games he has four goals and four assists. Perhaps
the brightest spot in this dismal soccer season is

the goal keeping of junior Kirk Mancer who]

statistically leads the conference. He has allowed
only twelve goals while) stopping 94 other shots,
coming to an average of 1.2 goals a game.

 

 

Booters Hope To Finish At.

by John Harrison

With only an outside chance
of finishing the season over .500,
the Washington and Lee soccer
team will travel to Lynchburg
College this Saturday with the
hope of achieving a winning
mark in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference.

‘he Generals fell to 3-6-1
overall by dropping both of last

week’s games, 3-2 on Wednes-
day to Roanoke and 10 to
nationally-ranked Messiah Col-
lege Saturday. This brings to
four the number of games W&L

nas lost by a single goal.

The loss to Roanoke was
perhaps the toughest of the
season to date.

W&L built a 2-0 lead on goals
by freshman Gary Clements
and junior Jerry Moyer in the
opening minutes of each half.
Roanoke was outplayed and
outhustled until it was awarded

a penalty kick on an elbowing
penalty with eight minutes re-
maining.

The Marooons converted and

then took advantage of a poor .

pass and a steal for the decisive

goals, both of which came with
less than six. minutes left in the
game.

Before today’s game with 3

VMI, Prianian tried to explain
the offensive slump which has
caused the Generals to go
without a victory since Sept. 29.

Against Messiah, Head Coach,

Mermen Top Seed

by G. Bruce Potter

The Washington & Lee water
polo Generals came from
behind to defeat Richmond 7-5
last weekend, finishing the
Southern League tournament
with a 9-0 mark and earning the
top seed for the league cham-
pionships, to be played Nov. 7-8
at W&L.

Hampden-Sydney College,
19-1, the North Carolina “B”
team, 20-1, and James Madison
University, 18-3, also fell victim
to the Generals, who set the
record for most wins by a W&L
water polo squad, 21. The
record for most wins by any
team in any sport at W&L is 23
by the 1976-77 basketball team,
and that mark appears to be in
jeopardy.

The University of Richmond
capitalized on a W&L defensive
mix-up to take a.3-0 lead mid-
way through the, first period.
“Tim Rock’s., superb defense
combined withi,Andy Gates’
goaltending prevented Rich-
mond from getting an insur-
mountable lead re we could
get our tee rganized,”’
commented Hi ‘oach Page
Remillard.

Washington and ‘Lee finally
took the lead in the key match-,
up during the second period.
“‘We played very, very well,”
said Remillard. ‘“‘We kept the
pressure on Richmond the en-

200

many opportunities, but we
came up short.”’ Messiah
scored 30 minutes into the se-
cond half.

Junior back Tad Renner led
W&L’s effort in last week’s
games, sharing player-of-the-
game honors with freshman
Glenn Jackson against Roanoke
and earning the same against

pressive in the backfield, .as the

tire game and just kept pecking
away at their lead. We’re happy
with the win.

“We stayed with our game
plan and did not make the
mistake of trying to catch up too
fast. The team showed a lot of
confidence in each other.”

This marked the first time
that Washington & Lee had
beaten the Spiders at Rich-
mond, and the Generals will be
there again this weekend for the
Virginia State Championships,
in which Remillard’s ‘“B” team
will see their first official action
of the season. However,
Remillard will insure that the
“B”’ squad does not make the
Sunday finals because he needs
them as potential substitutes
for the “A” squad in the an-
ticipated rematch between
Richmond and the Generals for
the state title.

Co-captain Erik Peterson
shattered the record for most
goals in a season as he upped
his total to 114, which included
three tallies as he led all scorers
in the Richmond game. Senior
Mike Bernot eclipsed his per-
sonal record for most scores in
a season also.

In addition, junior Ken

Johnstone snapped a slump by
scoring two goals against Rich-
mond, and goalie Andy Gates

Angus McBryde was first with a

Gridders Win.

by Dale Park

In Sewanee, Tennessee, last
Saturday, the Washington &
Lee varsity football team rolled
up its highest total offensive
output of the season and claim-
ed its third straight win with a
13-6 victory over the University
of the South.

A crowd of 3300 watched as
W&L jumped to a 10-0 first
quarter lead. Junior Bill Devine
put the Generals ahead, 3-0,
with a 31-yard field goal and
classmate Chris Cavalline later
dove in from two yards out for a
touchdown to cap a 52-yard
drive.

The score remained 10-0 until
mid-way through the fourth
quarter, when the Tigers scored
on a 73-yard touchdown drive
with only 9:11 left in the game.
The Generals responded by tak-

about playing Bridgewater.
“We're happy to be 5-2 right
now, but we remember that we
were 5-2 last season and then
had to scramble for a 6-4
record. Bridgewater was one of
those final losses last year. Our

suspect the course is closer to 5
miles.

Pittman commented that he
and McBryde decided to tie
“‘with about a mile to go.”’ Pitt-
man added, ‘‘I knew at the mile
mark we were going to beat
them.”’ According to Pittman,
the number five ‘“‘man’’ for
West Virginia Tech was a girl,
but he noted that this was not il-
legal.

The meet was, perhaps, best
described by a story Pittman
tells.

“At about 2-1/2 miles, we
crested a hill and Coach Miller
and the West Virginia Tech
coach were standing there.
Neither of them said a word. I
think the West Virginia Tech
coach was in awe. We asked
Coach Miller (after the meet)
why he didn’t yell, and he said,
‘What can you say when you
have all your guys way ahead of
their top guy; and you’re only
halfway through the race?’”’

president and chairman of the
Philadelphia Suburban Water
Company, which later became
a subsidiary of Philadelphia
Suburban Corporation when
that company was formed in
1968 with Ballengee as its presi-

when he was elected to succeed
the late Ross L. Malone in the
position. He had been a trustee
since 1969, when he was nom-
inated for board membership
by a vote of his fellow alumni —
the first board member to have
been elected to office in that
manner, —

Formerly senior vice presi-
dent of the Campbell Soup:Com-
pany, Nuckols earned both his
undergraduate and law degrees
from Washington & Lee. He was
national president of the W&L

and was instrumental in insti-
tuting a series of special alumni
conferences to give former
W&L students the opportunity
to revisit the campus and gain
first-hand information about
the university and its students.

Mrs. Martin was elected to
the board in 1978. She is a past

In A Role Reversal,

Brothers Get Hazed

(continued from page 1)

Pi Phi has rlow.a $100 fine for
kidnapping, and has promised
the freshmen there would be no
hazing. Last year’s abduction of
a national representative by
freshmen pledges brought ex-
tensive social probation to the
house.

SAE Vandy Campbell was
lured out of the fraternity house
last Thursday night, abducted,
taken to Liberty Hall, an
covered with molasses and

feathers.
He was then taken back to the
Freshman Quad and left bound
in his underwear. ‘‘I hope they
enjoyed it,’’ Campbell told the
gawking freshmen, ‘because
they’re gonna pay for it.”
Sigma Chi Lee Nichols was
abducted two weeks ago on a
cold night and left in his boxer
shorts at Southern Seminary.
Nichols and spokesmen for the
house saw nothing wrong with

the prank.

 

Festival At Expoland

Augusta Expoland, located

near bucolic Fishersville, Va.,
was created ten years ago to
serve mainly as a location for
an annual weeklong country
fair. Each July, midway rides,
tractor pulls, cotton candy, cow
jshows and pickle contests
abound.
The Expo board has realized
that income must be maintain-
ed consistently throughout the
year, and has recently attemp-
ted to shed its redneck image by
featuring several non-country
concerts. Earlier this month,
for example, the ever-popular
Skip Castro Band teamed up
with Johnny Sportscoat and the
Casuals for an afternoon of
boogying.

. On Sunday, Nov. 8, Expoland
will be the site of ‘Fall Beach
Festival ’81.’’ This occasion
begins at noon and features a
day of concerts by The Embers,
The Catalinas, Steve Bassett
and the Virginia Breeze Band,
Bill Deal and th Rhondels and
Bill Pinkney and the original
Drifters. The #éstival will be
highlighted by'd shagging con-
test which offers'a'$100 prize.

While Fishersvitle itself is not
the mecca of ‘beach music,
Virginia’ and the Carolinas
seem to cling on to it more than
other places, so the location

 

might be considered appro-
priate. Tickets for “Fall Beach.
Festival” are $9 in advance and
$11 at the door. The shagging
contest will be held indoors.

Expoland is located on I-64 a
few miles from the junction of I-
81 and I-64 near Staunton. It is
more than adequately marked
by signs.

Tuesday afternoon § sherry
parties, the surrounding pubs,
the nudist colony bordering the
beautiful Isis River, full-figured
women, colorful foliage and the
daily tea time ritual — all this is
part of the fun-filled, (worth-
while) Oxford experience.

Picture the above-mentioned
sights along with one of the
finest individualized study pro-
grams offered anywhere and
you may get just a taste of what
W&L seniors Robert McLean,
Chris Muller, and Bo Parrish
enjoyed during their six-week
excursion to Oxford, England.

Under the Virginia Program

to Oxford, McLean, Muller, and —

Parrish journeyed abroad from
June 29 to August 7 with a group
of twenty-seven men and
women from Mary Baldwin,
Hampden-Sydney, Sweet Briar,
and Roanoke colleges.

Summed Bo Parrish of his
Oxford experience: ‘“You get so
much exposure to different
things.’’ That, it seems, is an .
understatement.

On the campus of St’ Anne’s
College in Oxford, the three at-
tended Monday through Thurs-
day classes in history and
English held in an informal and -
individualized manner.

Tutored, usually in groups of
three, for one hour sessions two
days a week and attending one
to two hour lectures four days a
week, the W&L trio were ex-
posed not only to prominent
historians and professors, but
also received the opportunity to
attend classes at various sur-
rounding colleges and univer-
sities. These included St.
John’s, Brasenose, and Univer-
sity College, some of which date
back to as far as the fourteenth
century.

Working under the English
tutorial system, McLain,
Muller, and Parrish learned to
present essays and critiques
and were graded upon the basis
of their ability to persuade
rather than on the accuracy of
their arguments. ;

Perhaps the most advan-
tageous aspect’ for the three
W&L seniors was the free time
and informal atmosphere of the
English life which provided

them with the opportunity of
establishing close friends and
lasting ties.

The convenient three day
weekends were often spent in
London (a mere hour’s train
ride from Oxford) which, com-
ments Muller, was great to
have access to but was expen-
sive and offered poor housing
facilities.

When not in London, the three
spent much of their time drink-
ing “bitter” or “lager,” as the

’ English refer to beer, at such

bars as the “Horse and
Jockey,” “The Perch,” and
several others located in the
quaint communities bordering
Oxford.

Whether playing croquet,
stretching out on the lawn of the
nearby University Park, or

“punting” (an afternoon coast
along the Isis River in a long,
flat boat), the trio had their
share of leisure time. But un-
doubtedly one of the greatest
assets of the entire trip was the
co-educational aspect of the
program.

Not only was the on-campus
housing co-ed (which, by the
way, proved highly sufficient
and comfortable), but men and
women shared classes together
as well. Needless to say, the
three well-graced W&L
gentlemen took full advantage
of the co-ed set up, and more
than one quiet weekend was
spent in the cozy countryside
beyond the city’s limits.

The Oxford experience,
McLean, Muller, and Parrish
agree, is an exciting, worth-

while venture. Above all, one is
exposed to the educational and
the social perspectives — of
England, both of which serve as
a valuable learning experience
in studying the entire scope of
British life. Bo Parrish claims,
“You do everything how you

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ririgtuim Phi

Talk Isn’t Cheap

Contact, the organization that drew fire last year
for its roster of ex-cons and political zombies, is in
need of funds. In case you haven’t heard, the price of
a quality speaker. has risen dramatically — and the
result is that small budgets such as Contact’s can at-
tract only mediocre talent.

To alleviate this problem, one Executive Commit-
tee member has suggested charging admission to
non-fraternity members and Lexington residents. We
find this suggestion to contradict the purpose of Con-
tact — one of providing an open forum of speakers to
the Lexington community.

The IFC apparently doesn’t have the money to pour
into Contact. Likewise, the EC has already commit-
ted itself to funding other groups. Perhaps Contact’s
savior can be found in Washington Hall. It doesn’t ap-
pear to be anywhere else.

Country Ethics

We've seen the posters advertising the play ‘“The
Country Wife.’”’ We can imagine one of two things:
either the Drama Department will do anything for at-
tention, or the play is so bad that students must resort
to sophomoric humor to bring attention to it.

Through its various sexual innuendos; the poster is
not only an insult to the intelligence of students, but is
also a sad indication of the wit of some W&L men.

Making subliminal advertisements in _ public
posters is something most of us were fortunate
enough to leave behind in high school. Obviously, a
few people on this campus never progressed beyonc
that level. v4 |

With Three Passed, Eight Rejected,

What Does Amendment Vote Show?

by Andrew Trotter
What is the significance of
last week’s vote on amend-
ments to the Student Body Con-
stitution?
The surprising thing is that
students voted. BOO]
Since 1974, amendments have;
died at the polls for lack of in-,
terest. The Constitution ‘re-
quires that at least 50 percent of
the student body express “yea” |
or “nay” on an amendment for |
a valid referendum. ;
‘This was achieved largely as
the result of EC members’ per-
sonal appeals to students.
President Eric Myers himself
stood by the polls for six hours
on Wednesday, exhorting pass-°
ing students to vote.
Sadly for the EC however, on-
ly three of the eight proposed

amendments were accepted by !

the required two-thirds margin.
The failed amendments includ-
ed one to eliminate the
Treasurer of the Student Body,
a position which has not been
filled for years.

The EC is thus in an awkward
position. Do W&L students ac-

 

Commentary

 

tually want a Treasurer? Or
were they just being difficult?

Another rejected amendment
was to ease the requirements
for the adoption of future
amendments. The W&L citizens
seem to want their constitu-
tional powers, everrif they rare-
ly choose to exercise them. .

This brings us to proposed
Amendment number seven,
concerning the relationship of
the EC to the Publication
Board. It would have changed
the EC mandate over the Pub
Board from “‘appellate jurisdic-
tion’’ to ‘powers of review.”

Some EC members insisted
that the amendment ‘“‘clarified’’
the relationship; rather than
changing its substance. The
amendment’s_ rejection in-
dicates that W&L students see
the implications of ‘‘powers of
review”’ for press freedom.

We may never know what
“appellate jurisdiction” is, but
we now know one thing that it is
not.

Other E.C. members stated
that the liason role of thé com-

“I think it’s running as

noted Myers. ‘It’s just that the
merchants don’t know it.”’

‘“‘Eppley (University
Treasurer) didn’t even know we
had a committee this: year ’til

The E.C. recommended that
Jacoby and the committee send
a memorandum to merchants
explaining their policy.

In other business, , Frank
Smith, ’83 Rep., asked about the
status of the Intellectual Sym-
posium. A motion by Ben Hale,
84 Rep., at the Oct. 4 meeting
set Oct. 19 as the date for ap-

Myers reported that officers
from the Computer Club and the
Mock Convention might work
together to offer the latter's
computer terminal to students
in help-sessions.

The Rugby Club treasurer
Todd Alexander was con-
gratulated by the E.C. for

Dorm Renovation
Progressing Well

by Ben Jarratt

The renovation of Graham-Lees dormitory is
progressing very well according to Douglas E.
Brady, Plant Projects Manager of Washington
and Lee University.

Brady said the project is on schedule and‘should
be complete in time for the beginning of classes in
September 1982. The renovation began at the end
of school last June.

The basic intent of the $2.7 million job was to
bring the dormitory up to the standards of the pre-
sent fire codes. Brady explained that Graham-
Lees was remodeled in 1941 and the building met
the fire codes then. Since that time, however,
codes changed, plumbing deteriorated, and doors
and trimming needed to be replaced.

According to Brady, several stages of work are
progressing. Structual repairs need to be com-
pleted before electricians, plumbers and
carpenters began their various tasks. After the in-
itial repair work is completed, the walls can be
replastered, painted and floor tile can be laid
down.

The work on Graham-Lees is progressing from
the top floor down to the bottom level. Brady said
this process allows for one group to begin work on
' one floor, while others are finishing work on
another floor.

Hotel Living Has

Only A Few Flaws

by Rob Schlegel

While some unlucky W&L freshmen are trying
to adjust to their tiny living quarters on campus in

Gilliam Dorm, it seems that the 90 or so freshmen
residing in the Robert E. Lee Hotel are quite
satisfied with their living conditions in downtown
Lexington.

There are only. a few complaints from the
students. These include the rather slow elevator
and the problem of people pulling the fire alarms.
No one knows for sure who has been pulling the
alarms, although some students believe the
culprits are townies.

The major complaint, however, concerns the
hotel parking lot behind the building. Dorm
counselors and freshmen aren’t permitted to park
their cars there.

According to one freshman resident, Craig
Narins, the parking lot is almost always empty.
Said Narins, ‘‘We’re residing at the hotel and it
(the parking lot) is for people using the hotel.”” He
noted that it’s even a longer walk to the freshman
parking lot from the hotel than it is from campus.

Narins remarked that some students are think-
ing of circulating a petition to protest the issue.
Another freshman who is upset about the parking
lot, Charlie Martin, said, “I think it’s really cheap
that we’re not allowed to park out there.”’

society should expect of jour-

Dr. Hodges characterizes the

man Isaacs, chairman of the
National News Council, who
will deliver a public lecture
tomorrow at 8 p.m. in the

weekend in what promises to be
an intense three-day seminar.
The institute is coordinated
each year by Dr. Louis Hodges
and features a highly-respected
assembly of journalists discuss-
ing issues involving the ethics of
the profession. For the first
time, the gathering will con-
template a central theme:

sessions as being ‘“‘useful for
both the faculty and the student
body.’’ The annual event is ap-
parently better known outside
the W&L community than with-
in, and this year it features
some of the most prestigious
journalists in this country.
Leading the discussion during
the first two days will be Nor-

University Library’s Northen
Auditorium. He will speak on
press responsibility.

Other notables scheduled to
attend include: Fred Behringer
of the Montgomery Publishing
Company, who is chairman of

FRESHMEN HOUSING Six Houses Given

Social Probation

by Steve Perry

Six fraternities were given
one week of social probation for
failing their house inspections.
Beta Theta Pi, Delta Tau Delta,
Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Nu,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Phi
Gamma Delta were all given
the opportunity to appeal their
convictions to the Student Af-
fairs Committee. If the frater-
nities decide to appeal their
cases, their sentences will be
held on obeyance until after
SAC reviews the cases.

Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent Hall Vetterlein expressed
concern over the lack of
coverage given to the positive
contributions of fraternities to
the W&L commnuity. The IFC
elected Bill Mooney and Jim
Hess Chairmen of an IFC
publicity committee.

Following the regular
meeting, three fraternities
were brought before the IFC

Judicial Board. Beta Theta Pi ~

was summoned for an incident

which occured Saturday night.
At approximately midnight

on Saturday, six Beta’s torched

Richmond Times-Dispatch; and
Ernie Schultz; executive direc-
tor of the Radio-TV News Direc-
tors Association.

a couch and two chairs in Red
Square, approximately 20 feet
from the Beta house. The Lex-
ington Fire Department
responded to the incident by
sending an ambulance and
several fire trucks. The firemen
subsequently complained to
Dean Of Fraternties Dan Mur-
phy that they were heckled by
the students. Dean Murphy
stated that one fireman was hit
by a bottle and several others
were doused with beer.

The Beta’s defended their ac-
tions by stating that the fireman

had deliberately turned their
hoses on the students. Beta
President Mark Robson staed
that ‘‘the aggravation was not
one party’s fault.’”” Robson add-
ed that the people involved were
not participating in a Beta func-
tion and that ‘‘a bad precedent
is set when a fraternity is held
responsible for the actions of in-
dividual members.”

The IFC was unanimously
convinced that since Betas were
involved and house furniture
was burned, the house could be
held responsible for the fire.
The Betas were given one week
of social probation and a fine of
$150. In addition, the Betas will
be required to write a letter of
apology to the Lexington
Volunteer Fire Department.

In other matters, Sigma Nu
was given two weeks of social
probation and Phi Kappa Sigma
conduct probation following a
bottle-throwing incident that oc-
cured last Wednesday night.

First in a series
by Steve Perry
and Todd Smith

Taps sounded at Virginia Military Institute at
11:35.

“That’s the best sound,”’ said one cadet.

“§--t,” said another.

The two Ring Tum Phi reporters pulled off the
robes they had used to ‘‘sneak”’ into the Barracks.
It had taken weeks to set up this meeting inside the
dorms of VMI.

A loud crack sounded at the door causing one of
the Phi’s reporters to start and whirl around. The
cadets laughed.

‘“‘When the captain’s gun hits the door, you have
to be alright,’’ said one cadet. ‘‘ ‘Alright’ means
not in a fraternity house,’ and wherever you’re
supposed to be. Getting caught in a fraternity,
they told us, means six weeks on confinement.
| A cadet covered the window with a black

blanket. ‘‘State of the art,’”’ he said. Another went
to the sink and relieved himself with the water

 

running. He said it was the custom of freshman
“rats” who are required to dress fully in order to
walk to the bathrooms.

The six cadets that gathered, however, were up-
perclassmen. The rooms contained five beds.
Uniforms hung on open rods. The cadets had been
given permission to hang three posters(VMI foot-
ball calenders). After inspection, however, the
shades were pulled down and Playboy pinups
revealed.

The discussion began about freshman life.
“Rats” cannot be touched, or their mothers bad-
mouthed, since hazing is a federal offense.
However, the ‘“‘rat’’ soon learns to put up with
shouting, sweat parties of push-ups and sit-ups ina
steamy shower room, and the chin-in, chest-out

| A trouble-ridden Sigma Nu
| fraternity is hoping for substan-
tial assistance from alumni to
‘help ease its current financial

woes. The key to the problem,
according to house president
Bill Dederick, lies in the en-

thusiastic participation of
chapter members.

|

| Since being evicted from their
| house, the chapter has lost a
| significant amount of income
from rents no longer paid by 17
‘to 20 members who would or-

dinarily live there. In addition,
‘it has debts totalling around
| $7000 in Lexington, including a
| whopping $2000 owed to Kro-
|ger’s. Sigma Nu’s_ national

| headquarters, located here in

| town, is unable to help with this

| problem due to a by-law which

stipulates it cannot pay for
debts incurred in town.

With a mortgage payment
due in December which could
determine whether the chapter
lives or dies, Dederick and
others are attempting to shore

_ up support. Alumni are report-

edly raising funds to bail out the
house, but Dederick does not
think that such a contribution
will be made until some frater-
‘nity members develop a
| positive consensus to get SNU

back on its feet. There are cur-
rently sbout 35 members of the
fraternity, but only 20 to 25 at-
tend meetings regularly, accor-

ding to the president. He ex-
pressed pleasure at a rush snag
of “eight or nine’’ pledges this
year.

The crisis atmosphere sur-
rounding the fraternity has
resulted in at least one rather
bizarre series of occurances.
The house itself is still used for

meetings and social events, and
a party featuring a reggae band
was planned for last Wednes-
day. Before the party, rumors

spread that the house chapter
had been revoked, and that the
party would be the scene of
mass destruction: a sledgeham-
mer party.

Administration officials got
wind of the party and Dean of
Students Lewis John telephoned
SNU Vice President Chris

Stokes to inform him that if the
frat disbanded and was physi-
cally destroyed, the university
would pursue _ individual

students for damages. The par-
ty turned out to be a non-violent
in nature, with the exception of
a bottle throwing incident in-

volving neighboring Phi Kappa
Sigma, which resulted in a few
broken windows, according to
Dederick.

So the future of the house re-
mains uncertain at this point.
The financial wounds are deep,
going back to years of unpaid
dues and some house treasurers

Hill Special Guest On
Chinese Relations Show

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity professor Harold Hill will
be a special guest on a televi-
sion show examining the United
States’ developing relations
with the People’s Republic of
China.

The show, which is part of a
series entitled “World Perspec-
tives,”’ will be aired at 9 p.m.,
Fri., Nov. 6 over Roanoke’s
public television station,
WBRA-TV (Channel 15).

Hill is associate professor of
German at W&L. His teaching
responsibilities include German
language and literature, Chi-
nese language and literature,
and Russian language. He was
formerly the director of the
university’s East Asian Studies
Program and conducts W&L’s

Mandarin summer school in
Taiwan.

Hill and William F. Rope,
director of the Office of Chinese
Affairs in the U.S. State Depart-
ment, will be the featured
guests on the ‘‘World Perspec-
tive” show. They will be ques-
tioned by a panel comprised of
Dr. Richard Smith of Ferrum
College, Henry Cox, retired
career foreign. service officer,
and Geoff Seamons, editorial
writer for the Roanoke Times &
World-News.

The television series is funded
by the Virginia Foundation for
the Humanities and Public
Policy, and its aim is to present
a complex issue in foreign
policy in simplified terms for
the average viewer.

who have been less than strict.

On the positive side, Dederick
says that all the house’s utilities
are paid up, and the dwelling

itself is cosmetically, if not
structurally sound following a
spruce-up after last week’s par-

ty. Dederick says that Mo Lit-
tlefield, executive director at
national headquarters, is ac-

tively interested in “turning
SNU around.”’ His efforts, and
an alumni contribution that

would be a shot in the arm the
chapter so desperately needs,
will be determined by a more

positive effort on the part of the
fraternity members as a whole.

Probably the most pressing
concern for the Sigma Nu
fraternity, now struggling to re-
main open on the Washington
and Lee campus, is_ the
numerous financial obligations
the chapter has to both the
university and local merchants.

The house owes approximate-
ly $25,000 in mortgage
payments to the university and
approximately $7000 to local
merchants.

According to one official con-
nected with the Sigma Nu
organization, Dan Rodriguez,
the fraternity is willing to help
the local chapter pay its debts

Law Conference On Bankruptcy

Lawyers and judges
specializing in consumer
bankruptcy cases participated
in a one-day conference at the
Frances Lewis Law Center in

Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s School of Law last week.
The participants, including
U.S. Rep. M. Caldwell Butler,
discussed problems currently

involved in consumer bankrupt-
cy cases under the Bankruptcy
Reform Act of 1979.

One of the major problems
many lawyers and judges have
identified with the new act in-
volves the increased cost of fil-
ing.

Joseph Ulrich, professor of
law at W&L, organized and
directed the conference, which

included 21 lawyers and judges
from Virginia and the District
of Columbia.

According to Frederic L.
Kirgis Jr., director of the
Frances Lewis Law Center, the
touse Judiciary Committee
plans to publish the proceedings
from the conference as a com-
mittee print.

SNU Continues To Labor Under Financial Burden

 

The Signa Nu house in disrepair and in debt.

SNU Owes $7000 To Merchants

to the university. The national
chapter is hesistant, however,
to underwrite the debts of the
local chapter to local mer-

chants. According’ to
Rodriguez, ‘‘You can’t expect
any fraternity. (to pay for debts)
accumulated by a _ chapter
through mismanagement. A
chapter is expected to set a
budget and keep within the
limits of that budget.”’
According to a person con-
nected with one of the local
firms that SNU owes money to,
“The chapter fell behind last
Spring and hasn’t paid a thing
this fall.’’ A spokesman for Na-
tional Wholesaler pointed out

that many fraternities only pay
a small amount of their balance -
each month, depending on how
responsible the house officers
are.

According to an official at
Kroger’s, Snu is making an ef-

fort to clear its debt at that |

store. National Wholesaler add-
ed that it has contacted the
chapter’s national organization,
located in Lexington, about the
debt.

The Executive Director of
Sigma Nu, Mo Littlefield, will
meet with Deans Lewis John
and Dan Murphy next week to
discuss the future of the chapter
at W&L.

‘Tuesday In The Pit’
gets Strong Feedback

by Gregory A. Coy

Washington and Lee’s
Cockpit and the University
Center Committee have provid-
ed a new twist for student enter-
tainment.

The twist. is
‘“‘Tuesdays.’’

Bob Schmidt originally pro-
moted the idea. ‘‘We are trying
to establish a_ tradition,
whereby every Tuesday night, a
student can expect some good
entertainment in the Cockpit.”
Schmidt also indicated that
“Tuesdays’’ can provide the
students with an option from the
fraternity parties and the local
bars.

“The E.C. gave enough
money for us to book a few
mediocre bands without charg-
ing the student body. By charg-
ing the students admission, a
double tax, we can get better
bands and more of them,’’ said
Schmidt.

“We try to get bands from the
area, with a good name, who
will draw a crowd, and give a
good show.”’

‘Although some of the bands
are expensive, some of them
usually cost $3.50 per person in
another bar, and that would be
for just one set,’’ according to

called

Schmidt.

Schmidt stressed that
“Tuesdays”’ is non-profit, and
that any surplus goes back into
the UCC. He added that
‘“‘Tuesdays’’ will continue
through the winter term.

“So far the feedback has been
positive, although we are open
to suggestions,” said Schmidt.
Tuesday night bands in the
Cockpit were endangered last
week when the management of
the Cockpit and the Committee
wrangled among themselves
about the closing time on
Tuesdays.

Jerry Darrell, who runs the
dining hall, the co-op and the
Cockpit, considered 1:30 a.m.
an unreasonably late closing
time. Student managers and
workers would be kept until
almost 3:00 a.m. cleaning up,
according to Doug Linton, stu-
dent manager.

The Committee considered
midnight too early to pack up
the band, and threatened to
take ‘“Tuesdays’’ to Zollman’s
Pavillion, about five miles
southwest of town.

A compromise of 12:30 a.m.
was reached.

----Todd Smith added to
this report.

telleetual Symposium at Mon-
day’s Executive Committee
meeting.

Jon Pakula told the E.C. that
‘four people for a project of this

The 6:30 meeting also produe-
ed subcommittee reports from
the Student Activities Board,
the Calyx, the Voting Regula-
tions Board, and the Ariel.

Five students were appointed
as a steering commitee for the
symposium, the only five that
showed up. The purpose of the
Symposium is to involve the

The idea oringinated with Dr
Thomas Williams and the Com-
mittee for Liberal Education.

Evidence of the Southern
gentleman stereotype at
Washington and Lee University
once again prevails. In the
tradition of the 19th century
riverboat gamblers who risked
money, slaves, and even planta-
tions on the flip of a ecard,
students nave turned to casual
gambling as a source of enter-
tainment, though for much
smailer stakes.

The pink football betting
cards are common in the
freshmen dorms, fraternity
houses and other areas of cam-
pus. The way they work is sim-
ole. In each game, a favorite
and anunderdog is chosen, and
the projected margin of victory
is given.

If the bettor thinks the
favorite will win by more than
the ‘‘spread,”’ he chooses the
favorite. On the other hand, if
he feels the favorite will fail to

Hale, the ad hoe E.C. member
of the symposium, aiso felt that
there was no need to name a
chairman on Monday.

He recommended looking for
a well-qualified member on the
faculty or from the Law School.

Secretary Bennett Ross and
Vice President Jim Averett
argued that time was running
out, Ross said that the meeting
was weil-advertised and that
those who did not come should
not be considered. ~

The chairmanship question
was not resolved.

Hale explained ‘o the Com-
mittee that he had sent out let-
ters about the Symposium to the
faculty. “If you think they went
out late—well, f don’t.’

the underdog.

Winnings are based on the
number of games chosen. Odds
start at three games, at which
they are 6 to 1, and go to ten
games, at which point they are
750 to 1.

This means if the bettor
chooses three teams and bets
$i, he will win $6 if all three
teams win.

Cards are usually distributed
by a member of the custodial
staff who wished to remain
anonymous. He estimated that
he passes out adoui 190 cards a
week and receives 75 percent
back with bets. ‘Usually there
aren't many Winners here, but I
hear about them in other
places,” he said, noting that he
isn’t the only one who
distributes the cards.

The making, placing or receipt,
of any bet or wager in this State of
‘money or other things of value,
dependent upon the resuit of any
game, contest, or any other event
the outcome of which is uncertain
or a matter of chance, whether
such game, contest or event, oc-
curs or is to occur inside or out-
side the limits of this State, shall
constitute illegal gambling.

He added that sections
18,2-326 and 328 designate bet-
ting as a Class 3 misdemeanor
and operating a gambling
enterprise or activity as a Class
6 felony.

Dean Robert Huntley said the
university’s _stand.. was.- less
severe. ‘‘We won’t start

legislating something of such
minutia,” he said.

Huntley quoted Queen
Elizabeth, who said when ad-

laws requiring attendance at
the Anglican Church, “‘I desire

Japanese Series Finishes Up

by Carren O. Kaston
Washington and Lee Univer-
ity’s series of Japaneses films

concludes this Monday, Novem- _

ber 9, with the widely acclaim-
ed Woman in the Dunes (132
minutes). The series returns to
classroom ‘A’’ of Lewis Hall
for this last movie, which will
be screened at 8 P.M., free of
charge.

The most recent of the five
films shown in the series,
Woman in the Dunes was
directed by Hiroshi
Teshigahara in 1964. It was
nominated in that year for an
Academy Award as_ Best
Foreign Film, and won the
Special Jury Prize at the Can-

by Carren O. Kaston

The Film Society’s second
movie this season is Reinhard
Hauff’s superb psychological
mystery-thriller Knife in the
Head (Germany, 1978: 108
minutes). It will be shown Fri-
day and Saturday, November 6
and 7, at 8 P.M. in classroom
‘A’? of Lewis Hall, free of
charge.

Hauff is one of a second wave
of directors to emerge from the
West German film renaissance
that began in the 70’s. The first
wave includes Werner Herzog,
Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and
Wim Wenders, whose films
have appeared in earlier Film
Society series.

Hauff’s hero in Knife in the
Head is a biogeneticist who is
shot in the head while looking
for his wife at the headquarters
of a radical political group. Ex-
tensive brain damage impairs
his speech and memory.
Despite its title, Knife in the

nes Film Festival. Teshi-
gahara’s film is based on the
1960 novel Suna No Onna , which
won for its author Kobo Abe the
Yomiuri Prize for Literature in
Japan.

The plot concerns the stay at
a desolate village amidst the
dunes of a young vacationing
entymologist, or insect
specialist. The villagers have
persuaded him to help a widow
who lives in a sand and whose
task is daily ta. shovel her house
free of the sand. This sand is
then hauled up and away by

rope, and she is brought food in
turn. She never leaves the pit,
and the man soon discovers, to
his alarm, that he cannot either.
Eventually, he becomes the
woman’s lover as well as her
helper. When he has a chance
some time later to escape, he
does not take it.

The trapped teacher-scientist
is played by Eiji Okada, who
gave so memorable a perfor-
mance in Alain Resnais’ Hiro-
shima Mon Amour

Bishop Here Tuesday

Elvin Bishop. was born in
Tulsa, Oklahoma and grew up
on a farm with hogs and
chickens; unlikely beginnings
for a musician whose career
has encompassed a variety of
musical styles and taken him on
many tours across the country.

In the early 60’s, Elvin earned
a National Merit Scholarship,
which gave him a ticket out of
Oklahoma. He chose the
University of Chicago, and
headed up north, where, on his
first day of college, he ran intoa
young blues harmonica player
named Paul Butterfield. The 18-
year old Bishop had not played
an instrument at this point, but
his meeting with Butterfield in-
spired him to get a guitar.
These were the beginnings of
Elvin’s off-campus studies in
Chicago’s South Side Blues
clubs, where he, Paul, and their
friend, Michael Bloomfield,
were the only white kids spunky
enough to sit in with the veteran
black Blues musicians. The
Paul Butterfield Blues ‘Band
evolved from these jam ses-
sions. Later, Elvin continued to
influence the course of
American music history by for-
ming his own band, The Elvin
Bishop Group, building his own
prolific career.

By this time, Bishop had
migrated to San Francisco, just
in time for the late sixties,
where he landed his first recor-
ding contract with ‘Bill
Graham’s Fillmore Records, a
subsidiary of Columbia. His
first album was The Elvin
Bishop Group, in 1969, followed
by Feel It. Elvin continued to
develop as a performer and
musician, and by his third
album, for Epic records, Rock
My Soul (1973), he had evolved
a style of his own, a good-time
mixture of rock and roll,
rhythm and blues, country, sw-
ing, and dance music, along
with some pretty gospel-type
vocal parts and tight in-
strumental lines. A meeting
with The Allman Brothers’
Dicky Betts resulted in a con-
tract with Capricorn Records,
and a renewal of Elvin’s roots in
the South. His 1974 album, Let It
Flow came at the height of the
Southern Rock Movement, ad-
ding another dimension to
Elvin’s unique musical blend.
His exposure as a good-rockin’
performer and recording artist

grew through Juke Joint Jump.

and then Elvin Bishop exploded
in 1976 with Struttin’ My Stuff,
which spawned the smash gold

single ‘‘Fooled Around and Fell

Brother Rat (1939) — Warner Brothers produced this play adap-

exterior shots were taken on the VMI campus but most of it was
made in Hollywood. This is reasonably entertaining stuff, of
primary interest for obvious local reasons and the fact that it was
an early hit for a young contract-player named Ronald Reagan.
The rest of the cast includes a young Eddie Albert, Priscilla Lane, a
mousey: Jane-Wyman;- who would be the first Mrs. Reagan, and
Louise Beavers. Ronnie is an aw-shucksy veemee. Presented by
the SAB this weekend at 7 p.m. in duPont. Admission is $1.

Grand Illusion (France, 1937) — Jean Renoir’s quietly beautiful
anti-war film, with excellent performances by Jean Gabin and’
Erich Von Stroheim. A subtle, moving film highlighted by splended
photography; a genuine classic. Shown by the journalism depart-
ment Tuesday at 7 and 9 p.m. in Reid 203. Admission is free.

Elvin Bishop: A Man For Good-Rockin’ Fans

in Love;”’ the sentimental, pret-
ty ballad won him a new follow-
ing in addition to his good-
rockin’ fans.

The logical follow-up was
Hometown Boy Makes Good,
and then the 1977 live double
album Raisin’ Hell, a cross-
section of Elvin’s best tunes to

   
   

Automatt in San Francisco, it
features some of the Bay Area’s
finest musicians, including
Maria Muldaur on vocals, noted
guitarist Amos Garrett, Phil
Aaberg on keyboards, and the
rest of Elvin’s excellent road
band. Commenting on Hog
Heaven, Elvin said, ‘‘A few of
the tunes are more smoothly

that point. This is a great con-
cert LP, capturing the excite-
ment and humor of Elvin’s live
performances; Elvin has a
reputation for getting even the
most laid-back audience to
jump out of their seats and
boogie. The band is renowned
for its tightness and crisp, well-
executed solos from each
player; Elvin has assembled
various combinations of top-
notch musicians who really look
like they’re enjoying
themselves onstage. Elvin
himself has a comic presence
with his frizzy hair, expressive
face, and a wit that pervades
the atmosphere with a light-
heartedness; however, when he
steps up to play lead licks on his
guitar one hears the precision
work of a great guitar player, a
man who is determined to bring
quality to his audience. This
combination of humor: with a
tight band, excellent playing,
and a variety of styles all infus-

produced, but several come
under a_ ‘back-to-basics’
category for me. It’s an effort
on my part to broaden a little
bit. You know, I have an
‘automatic quality control’ in
my head and it was used a lot

ae

during the sessions. As a goal, I
try to shoot for the kinds of
things that Stevie Wonder and
Ray Charles have done; they
make music that is hailed by
other musicians and ap-
preciated by the public, too.
Some of the material, Elvin
notes, ‘has been around for
awhile, just like ‘Fooled Around
and Fell in Love’ had been, and
wen some of it’s brand new.”
He continues, ‘I think it’s the
best-sounding record I’ve ever
done. It’s just what I wanted out
of each track...and everyone
concerned is very proud of the
end result... knew what I
wanted, and the key to my ap-
proach was to surround myself
with people who knew exactly
what they were doing.
Everyone appearing on the
album is a seasoned player.
Also, I didn’t use strictly
regimented tunes. Instead, I
would go in the studio with just
fragments, teach the players a
chord or two to get the basic
idea across, and they usually
took it from there. So the musi-
cians were able to use a lot of
their personal ideas, and take a
more active role in each song.”
We can expect another new
album from Elvin Bishop in late
1979, in the process of being
recorded right now. As Elvin’s
artistry has continually
matured on each consecutive
album, including his growth as
a songwriter, this is definitely
an album to watch out for. He is
one of the few artists in modern
American music history to con-
stantly explore new musical
territory and at the same time,
retain his own style of playing
and living without resting on the
laurels of a hit song. There is a
certain honesty and integrity
about an artist who, after pro-
ducing a gold single and many
notable albums, bought some
land in Marin County and finds
joy in his garden, his hogs (pic-
tured on the cover of Hog
Heaven), his chickens, and a

oe" MEMOREX

return to the country life of his
youth.

Elvin Bishop has seen a lot of
the world, but his music is still
rooted in an earthy light-
heartedness, for real people and
real life.

Editor’s Note: Elvin Bishop will
be appearing with Johnny Sport-
coat, Tues., Nov. 10, in the
Cockpit. Admission for the show
will be $4.

Members of the Washington & Lee Water Polo team during their
Virginia State Championship game.

Polo Sets Win Mark,
Takes Va. State Title

by G. Bruce Potter

“Amen.” '

So said Page Remillard, head
coach of the Washington and
Lee water polo team, after his
squad soundly defeated five op-
ponents, including the Universi-
ty of Richmond, to capture the
Virginia State Championships
last weekend.

The Generals will now come
home for the Southern League
Championships, a_ two-day,
four-team double-elimination
tournament, this weekend at Cy
Twombly pool.

W&L downed the University
of Virginia, 27-3, the University
of Richmond ‘B’’ team, 11-2,
Lynchburg College, 10-3, Hamp-
den-Sydney, 5-0 (by forfeit),

~and, in what proved to be the
championship game of the
round robin event, the Universi-
ty of Richmond, 10-3.

“We put it all together
against Richmond,”’ said Re-
millard. ‘I was more nervous
before the game started than
the players.” The Generals

boosted their record to 26-4 and,
in the process, set a school
record for most wins by a team
in any sport in one season.

Remillard said that his squad
is ‘‘more structured, more dis-
ciplined and in better shape’
than the University of Rich-
mond. In addition, he was pleas-
ed because the team had never
really previously taken charge
of key games.

The four losses suffered by
the Generals this season came
as a result of not converting the
opponent’s turnovers, explain-
ed Remillard. Against Rich-
mond, however, the Generals
capitalized on their turnovers
even though both teams had ap-
proximately the same number.

Goalie Andy Gates stopped 12
of 15 shots and had two assists :
and junior Ken Johnstone
scored three goals to pace the
Generals against Richmond. In
addition, sophomore Rand Mc-
Clain took seven shots for the
tourney and made all seven,
and junior co-captain Erik

Peterson hit 59 percent of his
Shots despite forcing some
shots, according to Remillard.
Bobby Pearson and Matt
Ravencraft were “outstanding
off the bench,’’ said the third-
year coach.

Overall, the Generals outshot
their opponents 55 percent to 24
percent &nd outscored them
58-11 in the four games (not in-
cluding Hampden-Sydney’s for-
feit). Remillard is still not
pleased with the team’s six-on-
five (power play) offense,
however, they managed to con-
vert on 52 percent of their op-
portunities last weekend, but
Remillard will be putting some
emphasis on that aspect of the
Generals’ game this week in
practice. “‘We’re forcing shots
instead of taking advantage of
the defense,’ he said.

The teams that will be com-
peting this weekend other than
W&L areas follows:

James Madison University
—the Generals’ opening round
opponent (9:30 a.m., Sat., Nov.
7), represented the Southern
League at the Division II
Eastern Tournament last
season.

Duke University — beset by
injuries of late but a “‘disciplin-
ed and motivated team,”’ accor-
ding to Remillard. They
defeated both Richmond and
W&L in 1980.

University of Richmond
—defending Southern League
Champions must open the
tourney against Duke. They
should be hungry for revenge,
however, having lost to the
Generals two weeks ina row.

Should the Generals have pro-
blems winning this weekend’s
Southern League Champion-
ship, then, says Remillard, they
can forget about pulling any
upsets at the Eastern Cham-
pionships the following week-
end, to which the Southern

~ League champion will advance.

However, if they sweep their
competition, Remillard advises

_ that the teams in the Easterns

had better ‘‘beware.’’

Remillard concluded, ‘‘If
we’re worth our salt, we should
be able to handle this tourna-
ment the way we did the one
last weekend.”

 

Harriers Win 2 Of 3
In ODAC Tune-up

by Rick Swagler
They say two out of three ain’t

bad, and the W&L cross-country

team found this to be the case

last weekend in a meet against
Lynchburg College,
Mennonite College, and Hamp-
den-Sydney College.

Eastern

The Generals lost, 32-23, to

ODAC rival Lynchburg, and

eked out a 29-30 victory over
Eastern Mennonite. Hampden-

Sydney forfeited, giving the

Generals a 15-50 victory. The
meet was run at Eastern Men-
nonite.

Angus McBryde placed first
for the Generals and fifth
overall with his fastest time this
season, a 26:56. Frank Pittman
finished seventh overall and se-
cond for the Generals with a
27:29. Jon Kelafant ran a 27:58,
placing tenth overall and third
for W&L. Captain Greg Branan
placed eleventh overall, fourth
for the Generals, and ran a
28:29. Steve Whetzle rounded
out the W&L top five with a thir-
teenth place finish and a 29:10
clocking.

Coach Dick Miller admitted
that the team ‘‘didn’t run well,”’
explaining that ‘‘the top five
spread was way off.” The ‘‘top
five spread’”’ is the length of
time that elapses between the

Commentary

first W&L finisher and the fifth.
At Eastern Mennonite, the
spread was 2:14. The spread is
usually around 1:40 or 1:45.
Pittman explained that
“everybody but Angus (Mc-
Bryde) had a bad day.” Look-
ing forward to this week’s meet,
the ODAC Championship, Pitt-
man predicts that the meet will
essentially be between W&L,
Lynchburg, and Roanoke Col-
lege. McBryde agreed, saying,

_“To win the ODAC, everybody

has to run really well. We’re
peaking for the ODAC.”

Kelafant says the team will
“be all rested and ready to go”
on Saturday. The ODAC Cham-
pionship is being run at Bridge-
water College this year, and
Kelafant commented on the
course. ‘“‘Bridgewater’s course
is all roads — like a road race.
I’d rather run on trails and I
think most guys would too. It’s
more scenic, like real cross-
country.”

Kelafant' described the
Generals’ performance _ this
past weekend as ‘‘just not hav-
hi that spark, we were kind of

at.”

The ODAC Championship
begins at 11:30 Saturday morn-
ing at Bridgewater College.

football team has also climbed
the ladder to sit atop the ODAC.

Amidst the refreshing suc-

team has been, if you will,

General Facts

About Catholic

Coach Gary Fallon’s
Generals take their 6-2 record to
Washington this weekend to
play the Catholic University
Cardinals. Catholic is the
newest addition to the ten
member Old Dominion Athletic
Conference having been voted
in last. spring.

Twenty-seven lettermen
return this year to Catholic.
Pascale implements a 4-3
defense which returns only five
starters from last season.
Multiple offenses typify the
Cards as seven offensive
starters return. Last Saturday,

Catholic fell to the Generals
opening nemesis Gettysburg
6-0.

“The Cardinals are a big
unknown to us, simply because
we've only seen one film and
because we have so few com-
mon opponents. We'll
have to beware of them trying
to make an early mark in the
conference. They join the ODAC
competition next fall but play
two league schools this season.
We know they’d like to get the
jump on the ODAC so we look
for them to give it their all on
Saturday.”

Match Raises Money

by Eric Fife

Virginia Military Institute
out-played Washington and Lee
University Thursday in a soccer
match designed to raise money
for the Lexington-Rockbridge
United Way.

The match brought a 2-1 vic-
tory to VMI and more than
$1,100 to the local United Way
fund-raising effort.

According to Mrs. Penny
Henneman, Executive Director
of the Lexington-Rockbridge
United Way, the match was “a
complete success. It brought in
at least $1,100 and it got the
whole community, students and
local citizens, involved with the
fund-raising activities.”’

neman said.

Half-time featured an eight-

Lexington Youth Soccer teams;
the Hawks tied the Condors in

Mrs. Henneman said the pro-

by Dale Park

On Wilson Field last Saturday
six players took part in the scor-
ing act to lead the Washington
and Lee varsity football team to
its fourth straight win, a 30-0
decision over ODAC rival
Bridgewater College.

W&L received touchdowns
from junior Chris Cavalline on a
six-yard run, classmate Ken
Robinson on a nine-yard run,
classmate Pat McGuire on a
one-yard run, and senior Mike
Fogarty on a 15-yard pass from
sophomore Al Paradise. Junior
Bill Devine added three point-
after conversions and a 40-yard
field goal, which equalled his
career best.

Cavalline, despite having on-
ly 36 yards rushing on the after-
noon, proved to be the key man
for the Generals offensively.

“We knew that Bridgewater
pursued the football aggress-
ively,’’. commented Head
Coach Gary Fallon. “Bridge-
water was so intent on contain-
ing Cavalline that we used
Cavalline as a decoy and ran
misdirection plays that kept
Bridgewater confused.’

By decoying Cavalline to the
right or left, the pursuit of the
Bridgewater linebackers . left
tight-end Fogarty wide open
over the middle. Paradise found
Fogarty nine times for 109
yards and one touchdown. All

together, Paradise completed |

14 of 21 passes for 141 yards.
The Generals rolled up 360

yards total offense. Defensive-

ly 93 total offensive yards.

The win raised W&L’s overall
record to 6-2 and, coupled with a
24-18 Maryville victory over
Randolph-Macon, moved the
Generals into a first-place tie
with Maryville in the ODAC
standings.

Next week the Generals will
face this year’s addition to the

both sides; with neither team
able to put more than one or two
passes before losing possession.
As a result, most of the shots
were taken from 40 or more
yards. It wasn’t all that surpis-
ing, then, that it took an embar-
rassing blunder by VMI keeper
Anthony Yelverton to create the
first scoring opportunity.

After making a routine save,
Yelverton prepared to kick the
ball away. He slipped on the wet
turf, though, and dropped the
ball; leaving sophomore Roland
Simon with an easy tap-in with
a minutes remaining in the

alf.

VMI tied that game at the 14-
minute mar* in the second half
when Steve Ross’ shot from the
right corner delfected off an ex-
tended Kirk Mancer. Freshman
Brian Colgan connected for the
winner on a sharp 15-yarder
directly in front of the W&L goal
after the Generals had failed to
clear the ball.

Fall Tennis Program

Comes To A Close

by Dan Tatum

Washington and Lee tennis
had its ups and downs this fall,
with the emphasis mainly on
downs. After being soundly
defeated at the U.S. Naval
Academy in a_ tournament
against Army, Navy, Swar-
thmore, Columbia, Penn State,
and Maryland. The netmen
were beaten by Ohio and
Maryland in the W&L Invita-
tional. However, W&L did
dominate tying singles 3-3 and
taking doubles 2-1. In the final
match of the season, James
Madison University came out

| ontop.

According to Head Coach
Franke the fall team was rather
young and_ inexperienced.
However, the fall program is

mainly meant to evaluate the
player’s abilities and to decide
who to ask back in the spring.
Coach Franke also said that the
tennis went up against some

tough and well seasoned op-
ponents this fall but the ex-
perience should prove valuable
in the spring in helping to
prepare the players for the
NCAA tournament.

The fall team was led by
senior captain and number two
player Wes Yonge, number one
player sophomore Graig Can-
non; and number three player
Charlie Kalosay, also a

sophomore. Other prominent
players were freshman Jaimie
Reilly ranked _ fourth,
sophomore Jim Irwin, ranked
fifth, and freshman Steve Bend
Bendheim, ranked sixth.

Coach Franke noted that the
performance of last year’s ten-
nis team in the nationals should
be a challenge to this year’s
team. He also expressed a hope
that anyone who was reluctant
to play in the fall will come out
for J.V. or varsity in the spring.

Parents’ Weekend Increases Sales By 30 Percent

by Patrick Jordan
Practically all Lexington
merchants’ interviewed

reported substantial increases
in sales during Washington and
Lee’s Parent’s Weekend.

According to Shirley Feazell,
Manager of the Athletic Attic,
the parents and students com-
ing into the store after
Washington and Lee’s football
game last Saturday resembled
‘“‘a herd of cattle stampeding
toward the door.”’

‘There were just mobs of peo-
ple everywhere,’’ said Feazell.
“This store’s sales for the
weekend were three times what
they were for parents’ weekend
last year and Saturday was the
biggest profit day ever.”’

She added that Washington
and Lee T-Shirts were the big-
gest seller with shoes a close se-
cond.

Connie Hostetter, a manager
at the Palm Parlor Restaurant,
said her business ‘‘jumped a
good 30-40 percent in its profits
over the average weekend.”’

According to Alvin Carter,
owner of the Alvin-Dennis
Clothes Store, parents’ weekend
is usually the top weekend for
sales at his business during the
year.

“T think that this Parents’
Weekend was better than
usual,”’ said Carter. ‘“The good
cool weather might have had a
lot to do with it and the date

was just late enough so as to
make the parents feel like get-
ting away from home.”

Bill Mason, part owner of the
Clothes Rack, said there was a
one-third increase in sales in his
store over the average week-
end. Mason added that this
year’s Parent’s Weekend was
more profitable than last
year’s.

Robert Candea, Manager of
Spanky’s, said his restaurant
served approximately 2400
meals over the weekend, not in-
cluding carryout orders.

Candea said that altohugh
Washington and Lee’s Parents’
Weekend was excellent, VMI’s
Parents’ Weekend is usually a
bit more profitable for the

Hough, Touchton Named Trustees

vice president of a Winston-
Salem, N.C. bank, and J.
Thomas Touchton, managing
partner of a Tampa, Fla., in-
vestment firm, have been

the university and was
nominated for the trusteeship
by a vote of his fellow W&L
alumni. He is senior vice presi-
dent and manager of corporate
banking for Wachovia Bank &
Trust Company in Winston-
Salem.

Touchton graduated from

W&L in 1960. He is managing

Nevertheless, not all Lex-
ington businesses reported
above average profits last
weeken.

Betty Huffman, Manager of
Campus Corner, said sales over

Parents’ Weekend were about
average, except for film which
was in high demand.

She added that alumni
weekend for her business was
usually better than Washington
and Lee’s Parents’ Weekend.

Puryear Named Cadet

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s Military Science Depart-
ment has named senior Scott B.

College student who is _par-
ticipating in the W&L program.

Ryan Articles Published

Halford R. Ryan, associate
professor of public speaking at
Washington & Lee University,
recently published two articles
inscholarly journals.

One of Ryan’s articles,
published in the ‘Quarterly
Journal of Speech,’’ the oldest
and most prestigious speech
journal, examined the composi-
tion of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s
fourth inaugural address.

Ryan worked with 10 drafts of
the FDR address’ to determine
that speech writer Robert Sher-
wood composed the final ad-
dress from a core of Roosevelt’s
dictation. Ryan’s research also
showed that FDR rejected
drafts from his other speech
writers — Archibald MacLeish
and Judge Samuel Rosenman
—because they stressed mili-
tarism too much at a time when
FDR wanted to preview the
peace which would follow World
War II.

Ryan’s research into the arti-
cle, entitled ‘‘Roosevelt’s
Fourth Inaugural Address: A
Study of Its Composition,’ was

conducted on a grant from the
Eleanor Roosevelt Institute in
Hyde Park, N.Y. It is a con-
tinuation of his study of FDR’s
four inaugurals. He earlier had
published ‘‘Roosevelt’s First In-
augural: A Study of Technique”’
in a 1979 issue of the ‘‘Quarterly
Journal of Speech.”’

Ryan also published an arti-
cle entitled ‘Individual Speak-
ing Events: Two Organizational
Patterns’’ in the national
publication of the forensic
honorary society Delta Sigma
Rho — Tau Kappa Alpha. His
article in ‘Speaker and

~Gavel’’ examines speeches by
Edmund Burke, Patrick Henry,
Joseph McCarthy, and Richard
Nixon to illustrate how student
speakers could be more per-
suasive by using the ‘classical
pattern” (first invented by the
ancient Greeks) and _ the
‘Method of Residues.”

Ryan is a graduate of Wabash
College in Indiana. He received
both the M.A. and Ph.D. de-
grees from the University of Il-
linois,

Cockpit Makes Positive Changes For Customers

by Gregory A. Coy
Trying to bounce back from a
bad year, the Washington and
Lee Cockpit is taking on some
positive changes this year.

The “Pit” is a pub and fast-
food grill located in the Univer-
sity Center.

Student Manager Doug Lin-
ton indicated that labor costs
had put the Pit in the red.

“We had too much labor and
not enough business,”’ said Lin-
ton. ‘‘This year we had to cut
back on labor.”’

Indeed, the Cockpit has lost
many of its regular customers.
The lunch crowd, which con-
sists of professors and
townspeople, has dropped con-
siderably.

Linton said that the largest
drop was during night business
hours. Thursdays and Sundays
are the weakest days and nights

Japanese

(continued from page 4)

The movie is a
cinematographic version of the
fable of Sisyphus, who in Greek
mythology was condemned for-
ever to roll a huge stone up a
hill, only to have it roll down
again on nearing the top. This

fable has been taken as emble- .

makes on the viewer from one
excruciatingly suspenseful mo-
ment to another.

The film focuses. on the
hero Hoffman’s effort, amidst
police and radical attempts to
tell him who he is, to recon-
stitute his identity for himself.
It is in these terms that the
movie can be classified as a
mystery. The movie is literally
about the biogeneticist’s redis-
covery of what it means to be
human. And Hauff’s sense of
what being human means is so
rich that it enlarges the conven-
tionally accepted boundaries of
the mystery-thriller genre.

The hospital scenes in the
movie are wonderful. Hoffman

for the Pit.

The remainder of the week is
good, but not as prosperous as
in the past.

Although the profits are not
high this year, the first priority
of the Cockpit is not to make
money, according to Linton.

“The biggest misconception
about the Cockpit is the amount
of profit,” said Linton. ‘We
first cover labor cost, a break-
even operation, and the profits
go back into the Cockpit.”’

Linton strongly indicated that
the Cockpit ‘is a_ service,
primarily to the W&L communi-
ty.’”’ It is an important part of
the social life of the Washington
and Lee student.

A quicker service system and
a number of specials are part of
the positive change at the Pit.

“This is why we have initiated
the self-service ticket,’’ said
Linton.

“The customer takes the
ticket and makes his choice. He
then brings it up to the counter,
pays for it, and is brought his
food. A quicker system than the
conventional waiter/waitress
operation.”

The University Center Com-
mittee and the Cockpit are also
bringing in more entertainment
to the Pit, with live bands every
Tuesday.

Linton said that the Cockpit
will bring in local or regional
entertainment for weekends in
the future. Although Linton can
offer the band no more than a
meal and exposure, Bob
Schmidt and the UCC may offer
some small amount, no more
than $100 per month.

Film Series Ends

matic of the Existentialist
dilemma — the search for
meaning in an apparently ab-
surd universe. Woman in the
Dunes thus shows labor without
progress, but labor whose very
meaninglessness perhaps
enables the hero to discover a
sense of purpose in life.

The Japanese Film Series
was sponsored by W&L’s East
Asian Studies Program. The
films were made available
through the generosity of the
Japan Foundation, and were
shown in conjunction with the
W&L course ‘Japanese Liter-
ature in Translation.”

elegant comedy, Hauff touches
the heart of mans experience:
the life of the senses, muscular
coordination, language and
cognition, and sexuality. The
hero begins this odyssey with a
face so completely bandaged
that he can hardly be recogniz-
ed as human. Through this ban-
daged, humanoid front, he pro-
jects the sense of a con-
sciousness majestically
reawakening to full life.

many, a country which is
haunted by _ revolutionary

biogeneticist Hoffman seized

The Film Society’s next
movie is Ingmar Bergman’s
The Magic Flute (Sweden,
1975); scheduled for December
4 and 5 as a pre-Christmas
treat.

The W&L Film Society brings
to Lexington recent films of quali-
ty unavailable at the local
theatres. It is funded in part by
the student body, and in part by
private contributors. Screenings
are free and open to the public.
Contributions are most welcome.

“It is W&L students that
make or. break the cockpit,”
said Linton.

He speculated that if the
students don’t patronize the

Cockpit, it might fold, and will
not be missed until it is too late.
Linton concluded saying that
he is open to any suggestion and
comments about the Cockpit.

11 Students Apply For
Fullbright Grants

by Eric Fife
11 Washington and Lee
students have submitted ap-
plications for Fullbright Grants
— a nation-wide scholarship
competition which provides full

funding for a year of study
abroad.

Dr. Charles Turner, a W&L
history professor, said there are
fewer applicants this year than
last. 14 students applied for the
grant last year, five were ac-
cepted.

A Fullbright Scholarship pro-
vides exceptional students from
colleges and universities across
the nation who are interested in
studying in a foreign country

_with an all-expenses-paid year

of study in a country of their
choice.

A grade-point-average of 3.0
is required for application, but
Turner said that few applicants

are accepted with less than a 3.5
G.P.A.

This year’s applicants from
W&L are applying for study in
eight different countries. Two
students have applied for study
in Mexico, two for England, two
for Finland and two for study in
France. Turner has received

one application each for study
in Switzerland, Japan, West
Germany and Sweden.

Applicants may choose to
study in any of 50 countries.
Last year, 576 students were
chosen to be Fullbright
Scholars.

Applications are submitted
through each college’s
Fullbright officer, who advises
the applicant how to complete
the application. The Fullbright
officer forwards the applica-
tions to the national scholarship
board for consideration.

On Sept. 24, the Executive Committee passeda mo- |

‘ion which approved of such a symposium. The com-
mittee left itself with an escape valve, as it were, by
holding back on funding. The EC also did not give any
definite framework for a subcommittee to follow.

Only one question persists at this time: what has
happened to the symposium? Participation in the
symposium has been limited at best — and we really
can't understand why. To say one participated in an
intellectual symposium seems to be the ideal resume
fodder. Perhaps students are intimidated by the title
“intellectual symposium.” Or perhaps students just
don't care.

To call the symposium dead would be jumping the
gun, but itis not an unlikely prospect. The faculty has
already stressed the educational benefits from this
gathering and the EC has given tentative support.
Responsibility clearly lies with the student body,
which will either push the symposium forward or
allow it to die from neglect.

The irony of the situation is that Washington and
Lee takes pride in its intellectual standards, yet can-
not muster enough support to hold an intellectual
gathering every four years. If the symposium does in-
deed pass away, the W&L community should be both
ashamed and appalled.

Phi Editorial Termed Destructive

Dear Sir:

In response to your editorial
of October 29th concerning the
ethics involved with the adver-
tising of The Country Wife we
feel it is important to point out
that the play, written by
William Wycherley in the late
1600's, is a satire on the sexual
standards of that period. This
play contains the subliminal
sexual innuendoes which you
felt were so offensive and
sophmoric in our advertising.

{f the learned staff members
of the Ring-tum Phi had read

the play and known their sub-

ject (as is a basic rule of good ©

journalism) then they might
have been spared the embar-
rassment of criticizing a sub-

 

ject that they obviously had no
knowledge of.

In conclusion, our efforts to
promote this play were con-
structive, while your attempt to
criticize our efforts was
destructive. In the future, it
would be in your own best in-
terests to better know your sub-
ject before subjecting your
readers to your editorial opin-
See you at the play!

Sincerely,
The Publicity Crew
of The Country Wife

Editor Ignorant Of ‘Country Wife’

Dear Sir:

The editor of The Ring-tum
Phi is apparently ignorant of
what The Country Wife is ail
about. A witty man, Wyncherly
found out about a very sensual
intrigue | had during my rakish
years in London town. The cir-
cumstances of that intrigue
were rife with sexual innuendo
and subliminal suggestiveness.
Wyncher!y wrote down all the
bawdy language, social hypoc-
risy and behind-the-screen af-
fairs.

On another level, Wyncher-
ly’s story is also about my
friend Harcourt’s submission to
real love, loyalty to that one
woman and the institution of
marriage. But the public
throngs will be in the best mood
for The Country Wife, that

perclassman. Because the rat seemed to be enjoy-
ing it, he got to know the upperclassman a little
better at the next sweat party.

‘*A friend and I walked by him, letting him think
I didn’t see him. Then I turned around and said,
‘‘well it’s you, give me 20 push-ups.’’ He made the
rat repeat this five times, then said, ‘‘see you at
the next sweat party,” toscare him.

The cadets explained that only seniors can make
the rats drop and do calisthenics during the day.
Any upperclassman can ‘‘send a rat up” to be
disciplined by a freshman discipline board.
Demerits are commonly given for being late. One
rat was given demerits for violating a sanction
against pets by having a fly in his room, the cadets
said. He was given additional demerits for letting
it die. One oriental exchange student was sent up
for ‘‘slanting his eyes in ranks.”’

At a sweat party, the freshmen must be given
three minutes rest for every fifteen of exercise.
The cadets sometimes give all the rest time at the
beginning of an hour session as the rats are in the
“up” position of a push-up. Push-ups, sit-ups,
bootslappers, and running in place follow.

“You just break him down -to see what he’s
made of,”’ said one of the group about freshmen.
Some bear up well. A rat with wandering eyes in
formation was grilled, ‘What are you looking
around for? You want to buy the place?” The rat
answered,’’Have you got change for a quarter?”

Others wash out quickly on the rat line. One ran
screaming down what is now the Chessie Nature
Trail, shedding clothes, until he was found naked
on a rock. Another was fount seated, staring
blankly, when they turned on the lights one morn-
ing in the library. The pressure of practical jokes
led another to the edge of one of the balconies,
where he threatened to throw himself off.

‘“ ‘Jump, jump!’ everybody yelled.”

“If you’re a loser, everybody’s going to know
it,’’ said one cadet. ‘‘At a school of this size, you
know everybody.”’ If the esprit de corps surfaces
as practical joking and sweat parties inside the
barracks, it produces a fierce loyalty on the out-
side.

Cadets stick together in town and acknowledge
that they do not like to travel alone. ‘‘That’s true,
we’re pretty tight. Guys help each other out in
fights.”’ Another qualified that: ‘‘they even it up,
keep everyone else off.”’

With fraternities barred to those who have no
approved invitations, cadets rarely venture into
town. “Even if you’re not on confinement,” said
one cadet, there is no big reason to go into Lex-
ington. He could count several three-week periods
when he did not leave the vicinity of campus.
When you are not with other cadets, said one, ‘‘you
just don’t have the gumption to go uptown.”’

 

“If you're a loser,
everybody's going to
know it. At a school
of this size, you

know everybody.”’

Tensions build up so much during the week that
“when you go out, everything is in excess.”
Everyone goes completely bazoo,”’ joked another.

“You look forward to getting out of here,” a
cadet said. Others agreed that it was hard to see
the benefit of the aggravating, hard-as-C-rations
system. They all know the cliche, however, that
though you hate VMI when you’re in, you love it
when you’re finally out.

Why did the come to Virginia Military? “It’s a _
country club.”’

The majority of cadets at the clandestine
meeting were studying engineering. Only 15 per-
cent, they said, intended to make a career of the
military. One came because his father went.
Another said his parents gave him no choice.

A foreign student believed he was applying to
VPI instead of VMI. The cadets said he was here
three weeks before realizing that it was not the
Virginia Polytechnic Institute. One was told by his
parents that they were only sightseeing on the way
to school in West Virginia. Whe he stepped out to
look at VMI, his bags were pushed out and he was
abandoned.

‘‘T thought I was going away from trouble—and I
found it,’’ said a cadet who had been punished with
extensive confinement.

He and all other cadets were pardoned from con-
finement and penalty tours by President Ronald
Reagan at Yorktown. October’s Bicentenniel
celebration at the sight of the last battle of the
American Revolution included marching Keydets
in full uniform.

‘That was suck, that really sucked,”’ said one.

‘“‘We were standing there more than two hours,
freezing our cods off...listening to Francois (Mit-
terand, French president).”’

What did they think of W&L students? No one
wanted to answer.

One finally spoke up. He recalled the ‘Nuke
Iran Rally” two years ago. Washington and Lee
students led a torch parade to VMI, where
freshmen showed their sympathy by shaking
rifles from the windows.

“The only thing that bothered me was that after
the Iran rally, a W&L student told me that if there
was a war, he would go off to Canada.”’ Nor did the
other cadets like the idea of dying for a bunch of
warhooping minks.

“Your talking about people shooting at each
other, (that’s) some serious s--t,” said another
cadet.

‘Make love, not war,” grinned a third.

“Do you think we’re warmongers?” asked
another.

‘Wrong. We’d rather stay at the country club.”’

One hotel dorm counselor
noted that freshmen usually
aren’t allowed to park their
cars near their residence
anyway. But, being an up-
perclass student, he feels that
dorm counselors should have
the right to park there. He
stated, ‘‘It’s kind of a hassle to
us, not being able to park
anywhere near where we live.”

This rule concerning the hotel
parking lot was concluded in the
best interests of the hotel and
the University, and was includ-
ed in the lease. Other than this
complaint, the students seem
happy with their rooms and liv-
ing conditions.

Narins said that he gets sick
of the walk to campus, but in
reference to the size of his
room, he remarked, “‘It’s pretty
good.’’ He alsonoted the advan-
tages that students living in the

hotel have over students in the -

dorms. For example, hotel
freshmen may keep televisions
in their rooms and the rooms

have wall-to-wall carpeting. In
addition, every room either has
its own bathroom, or shares one
with another room. Narins men-
tioned that it is slightly difficult
to study in the hotel because of
the noise, but added, ‘‘It’s pro-
bably like that anywhere.”

One third-floor dorm

counselor remarked that he
hadn’t heard any complaints
about the distance to campus.
He said it’s not a big factor and
noted that the main problems
(the elevators and the pulling of
the fire alarms) are ones that
‘occur in any building. He went
on to say that most of the
freshmen in the hotel chose to
live there. There has only been
one student who has wanted to
move to the dorms, but this was
due to a roommate conflict.

cadets and Lexington townies,
especially in the Lee Tavern.
The chance of conflict is much
higher than it is on campus. Ad-
ditionally, the bar is loud at
night.

Bob Bryant, a freshman hotel
resident, said he enjoys living in
the hotel and remarked that
“The only problem I’ve had is
that there have been some in-
stances of people pulling fire
alarms. We think they’re
townies.”” Bryant mentioned
that the carpeting in the room
does keep things quieter.

Why did Bryant choose to live
in the hotel? ‘‘To be different,’’
he simply replied.

Another freshman living in
the hotel, Brian O’Biordan,
compared his living quarters
with those students residing on
campus when he said, ‘‘We’re

not in nearly as bad shape as
the people in Gilliam.”’ O’Bior-
dan continued, ‘‘It could be bet-
ter here but it also could be a
hell of a lot worse.’’ He mention-
ed that the location of the hotel
does isolate the students a little
and it also makes it easier for
fraternity kidnapping to take
place.

While the students are
generally satisfied living in the
hotel, the hotel administration
is similarly pleased with the
set-up thus far. Clyde Mull is
the former owner of the Robert
E. Lee Hotel who signed the
lease with the University for
this year. He sold the hotel two
months ago and has stayed on
until the new owners take over.

Mull has no complaints about
the students and said that
everything is ‘real smooth.”
Mull stated that the freshmen

are respecting the elevator and
taking pretty good care of it.
Mull also noted that problems
are kept down because of the
situation of the dorm counselors
and their supervision. “Dorm
counselors have taken a very
positive step toward seeing that
rules and regulations are
obeyed,” stated Mull.

The former owner said that
three years ago, when freshmen
were living in the hotel, ‘‘It was
pretty bad. This year there’s
really no comparison.”’ Mull
mentioned that much thought:
went into the negotiations with
the University before the lease
was signed. Mull Went on to
say, ‘I’m very well pleased to
this point. I thought there would
be more problems than we have
encountered, which is practical-
ly nil.”’

Mull noted that he has heard
hardly any complaints from
freshmen. “I think they realize
the importance of the renova-
tion probject (Graham-Lees),’’
said Mull.

SNU spokesman Chris Stokes
stated that no SNU’s were in-
volved in the incident. He added
that several students had seen
people who didn’t belong to SNU
on the top floor of the fraterni-
ty’s fire escape. Stokes also said
that a rumor had been cir-

culating that Sigma Nu had ©

planned a demolition party in
order to destroy the house.
Stokes denied that any such
party was planned and warned
his brothers that “if you see
anybody do anything to our

Graham-Lees Renovation Still On

(continued from page 1)

At the present time, the fourth floor is near com-
pletion. The walls still need to be painted, the floor
tiled and doors need to be replaced. In contrast,
only structural work has been completed on the

first floor.

The architectural plans call for the same style,
but lighting, wiring and plumbing will be moder-
nized. The stairwells are being enclosed and each
room will be equipped with a fire sprinkler system
to conform to fire codes. A ramp has been built to
help handicapped individuals. The university will
also lose some housing space because of necessary

space arrangements.

The construction work is being done by the Bass
Construction Company of Richmond. This firm
also worked on Lewis Hall, the University Library

and McCormick Hall.

The Lee dorm was completed in 1904, and
Graham in 1920. In 1941, the two were renovated

and connected by the addition of a middle wing,
which formed the U-shaped complex.

Local Man Found Guilty
In Feb. Pika Incident

by Patrick Jordan

_ A Natural Bridge man was
convicted in Lexington General
District Court Tuesday of
trespassing and carrying a con-
_cealed weapon last February at
the PiKappa Alpha fraternity.

' Edison Diamond, 39, of Route
One, Natural Bridge, was fined
$150 and given a suspended
sentence in connection with two
separate incidents at the frater-
nity during Fancy Dress week-
end parties.

Judge Joseph E. Hess
dismissed a third charge
against Diamond for ‘carrying
a loaded firearm within the ci-
jty.””

According. to Brad Vaughan,
a member of the PiKA house,
Diamond had entered the
fraternity during a party on
Feb. 28 and was trying to get
some of the girls to go outside
with him.

Vaughan said several of the

 

fraternity brothers became
upset and asked him and)
another fraternity member to
tell Diamond to leave.

“‘We escorted him outside and

 

told him it was a private party
and that he should leave,” |
Vaughan said. “He became |
somewhat upset at that point.
and he showed Andy Gries-
baum, the house president, and
me his handgun.”’

Vaughan’ said Diamond
returned to the fraternity early
on March 1 after being released
on bail and demanded to know
who had called the police the
day before.

Vaughan said Diamond then
started shoving some of the
house’s brothers and the police
were summoned again.

According to Lexington
Police Officer Wayne
Rhodenizer, Diamond was ar-
rested a second time and charg-
ed with trespassing.

Executive Committee Rescinds

Pub Board At-Large Members

By Todd Smith

Tom Booher, at his second
E.C. meeting as Freshman Law
Representative, presented a
subcommittee report on the
problems of the constitution on
Monday night.

The Executive Committee
also heard reports from the
Cold Check Committee and the

Ring-tum Phi, and from
representatives studying the
honor system.

A subcommittee of newly
elected Booher and Cole
Dawson ‘85, as well as
Secretary Bennett Ross,
presented nine recommenda-
tions for clarifying the constitu-
tion. President Eric Myers
commended them for ‘their
work.

Some of the recommenda-
tiens dealt with the recently
passed constitutional amend-
ments, and compliance with
them as well as with parts of the

Polo Wins Southern League Tourney

by G. Bruce Potter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team captured their
first Southern League Cham-
pionship by downing the
University of Richmond for the
second time in as many days,
11-5, in the final of the four
team, double-elimination event
last weekend at Cy Twombly
pool.

Only converting on two of
eight six-on-five (power play)
opportunities in the first half,
the Generals were down 4-2 at
halftime. ‘On a power play, if

_you’re a little too quick or a lit-

tle too eager, you miss the
goal,’’ explained sophomore
Rand McClain.

However, head coach Page
Remillard then stepped in. Mc-
Clain described his halftime
tongue lashing as a ‘‘motivation
speech.”’

Whatever he said must have
worked, because the Generals
were a new team in the second
half. They turned the ball over

‘on their first possession, but a

Richmond shot was off the
mark. On their ensuing posses-

sion, W&L took advantage of a
six-on-five situation and worked
the ball around to Ken
Johnstone to the right of the
goal. Johnstone, a lefty, easily
fired a bullet past the Richmond
goalie, and the lead was cut to
one.

Following another Richmond
penalty a minute later, All-
American Don Smith tapped in
a lob pass from co-captain Tim
Rock to knot the score at four.
Junior Erik Peterson then took
a pass from Johnstone and drill-
ed it home to give the Generals
the lead for good.

Washington and Lee, now
29-4, killed two penalties in the
next minute-and-a-half, and
when Rock, with 1:33 left in the
quarter, made a steal at mid-
pool, swam into a one-on-one
situation with the Richmond

constitution that had not been
amended.

‘‘We decided that we are go-
ing to have to follow the
balloting,’ said Booher for the
subcommittee, in reference to

’ lack of votes for an amendment

that would add two members at
large, appointed by the Ex-
ecutive Committee, on the
Publications Board.

A Ring-tum Phi editorial de-
nounced that amendment and
another that would clearly
subordinate the Publications
Board to the Committee. Ross
said at the meetings that the
editorial contributed to the lack
of a majority on other amend-
ments as well.

Ken Lang, ’82 Rep., spoke
against the rescinding of the
two members at large now serv-
ing as liasons to the Pub Board.
Lang recommended the E.C.
acknowledge ‘‘that we
overstepped our boundaries and-
that (future E.C.s) shouldn’t
appoint members at large.”’

He said that the present
members should be retzuined

because they had waited a long
time on appointment interview
night and had put a lot into the
job already.

“We're not dealing with a
piece of paper, we’re dealing
with two people.”’

Ben Hale, ’84 Rep., agreed
that the two appointees should
be retained. He noted that they
were not voting members and
their attendance at Pub Board
meetings was perfectly legiti-
mate.

Myers sided with Booher and
others who argued that to keep
the two in office would be to con-
tradict the mandate of the stu-
dent body.

To retain them would be a

“massive aberration,’’ said
Myers.

Usually reserved, Frank
Smith, °83 Rep., inveighed

against the retention of the two,
“they are no longer legitimate
because the vote has been no.”’
With an 8-4 vote, the E.C. ac-
cepted a motion to rescind Ed-
ward Gonsalves and Rob Willis

Election Night 1981:

Organized Confusion

by Chris Peacock and
Ben Jarratt
To most viewers and

listeners, broadcasts of election
coverage generally appear
relatively slick. But what goes
on when the lights are killed and
the reporters switch back to the
stations is sometimes little
more than organized confusion.

On election night 1981 two stu-
dent reporters for WLUR and
Cable Nine — Ben Jarratt and
Chris Peacock — found them-
selves to be part of that confu-
sion, and probably much less
organized.

It all began with our arrival
at the John Marshall Hotel in
Richmond, and the site of the
state Democratic Party’s vic-
tory celebration. We arrived
around 6 p.m. It appeared the
rest of the media-types had
been setting up since that morn-
ing; of course few of them had
to attend classes that day.

Our job was to send back
semi-regular reports to Reid
Hall. We had been instructed to
contact a member of guber-
natorial candidate (now
Governor-elect) Chuck Robb’s
staff, and she was to help us set
up. She was nowhere to be
found. In fact, it took over fif-
teen minutes to locate anyone
who had ever heard of the girl.

   
  

We never found her, but we
were befriended by a Roanoke
television reporter Eugenia
Halsey. She knew our contact,
but could not find her, either.
Eugenia did introduce us to
the only Democratic official in
sight. He was a state legislator
who appeared to have been

from the $2.25-a-drink bar went

was not a great deal of help.

We were told we would have a
spot reserved for us at one of
the media tables. ‘‘Spot’’ was
right. Awaiting us was a 3-x-5

Entertainment
Film Series In Review

by Carren O. Kaston

The Washington and Lee
Japanese Film Series conclud-
ed this Monday after presenting
five movies made available to
the school by the Japan Founda-
tion. The movies were Kon
Ichikawa’s The Heart (1955),
Yasujiro Shimazu’s Okoto and
Sasuke (1935), Mikio Naruse’s
Sound of the Mountain (1954),
Kon Ichikawa’s Conflagration
(1958), and Hiroshi
Teshigahara’s Woman in the
Dunes (1964). Attendance at the
showings averaged 50-90 peo-
ple. Audiences for the movies
shown later in the series were
larger, apparently because of
accumulated publicity and in-
creased awareness. Most of the
showings took place in the Law
School, which generously
donated the use of the room and
the equipment.

These films, which were spon-
sored by the university’s East
Asian Studies Program, were
shown in conjunction with
“Japanese Literature in
Translation,” a W&L course
which is taught in alternate

years. Professor Minor Rogers
of the Religion department, who
teaches the course with Pro-
fessor John Evans of the
English department, an-
ticipates having films again
when the course is offered in the
fall of 1983, although the selec-
tion may differ. Professor
Rogers hopes to be able to get
some films which are not adap-
tations of major modern
Japanese novels, but which
simply show contemporary
Japanese life. One of the goals
of the series, as stipulated by
the Japan Foundation, is to pro-
mote intellectual and cultural
understanding of Japan world-
wide.

Audiences at the films varied
from Washington and Lee facul-
ty and students, to townspeople,
to VMI cadets. Markham Pyle,
a W&L sophomore, believes
that the increasing importance
of the Far East to Western
businesses and_ industries,
especially the oil industry,
makes it essential that
Washington and Lee students
familiarize themselves with

emphasize the connections be-
tween marine ecology and
ocean energy resources, inter-
national law, world politics, and
corporate affairs.

During his visit, Mr. Hon will
meet with classes in Phi-
losophy, Sociology, and
Politics, and he has also ex-
pressed interest in classes in
Art and Religion. The breadth
of his interests suggests a
perspective seasoned in both
the arts and sciences.

Mr. Hon’s first love is
ecology, the study of the inter-
relationship of organisms and

Oriental attitudes and culture.
He sees the series as logical and
even necessary viewing for
many students here who would
not otherwise plan to attend.
Mr. Pyle, the former Phi
Entertainment Editor,
helped to promote the series by
giving space to weekly reviews
of the movies. He sees the up-
coming exhibit of Japanese and
Chinese Decorative Arts in du-
Pont Gallery from November 17
to December 17 as a similar op-
portunity for W&L_ students,
headed for business, to
familiarize themselves with the
East.

Professor David Bausum in
the Math department was
especially struck with the
Japanese interiors shown in the
film, the compact and highly
functional way in_ which,
through sliding doors, a
minimum of furniture, and split
levels, space is apportioned in
the Japanese house. Another of
the series’ attractions for him
was the emphasis on the family,
even when, as in many cases,

their environments. This led
him into an interdisciplinary in-
terest in the interconnectedness
of the various forces that shape
human life and consciousness.
Mr. Hon points out that a
typical education divides the
learning experience among
several disciplines and depart-
ments, which are regarded as
more or less distinct. The result
is that the kind of education now
favored rarely culminates in
the spirit of interdisciplinary in-
quiry which is its professed
goal.

Film Notes

Apocalpse Now (1979) Francis Ford Coppola’s indulgent spec-
tacle finds its plot in Joseph Conrad’s ‘‘Heart of Darkness” and
takes place during the war in Vietnam. It is embellished with amaz-
ing special effects, excellent photography and compelling perfor-
mances by Martin Sheen and Robert Duvall. The film loses ground
quickly at about midpoint, and its worse scenes occur near the end
when Sheen finally discovers his prey, Col. Marlon Brando, who is
living in decadence and controlling a community of rather stunned-
looking Cambodians. If these natives are Buddhists then it would be
understandable why they worship the obese, skin headed Brando;
the ending pulls down the rest of the film with more than a few:
credulity problems. A flawed masterpiece. Shown by the SAB: Fri-
day, Saturday, Sunday; at7 and 9:45 p.m. ; tickets are $1.

Stagecoach (1939) The classic John Ford western firmly
established John Wayne as a major star. Dudley Nichol wrote the
screenplay; portions of the film were shot in Monument Valley, a
favorite Ford locale. Not his finest western, but one of his most

‘entertaining, with Claire Trevor, Thomas Mitchell (Academy
Award), Andy Devine, John Carradine and Tim Holt. Shown by the
Journalism Department Tuesday at 7 and 9 p.m. in Reid 203.

Trio Entertains

by Andrew Trotter

Three young American
women, comprising the St. Ger-
main Trio, presented a lively,
refined concert to a receptive
audience last Tuesday night in
Lee Chapel.

The New York-based group,
whose name _ indicates the
members’ affinity toward
Paris, where each has lived,
studied and practiced, gave a
program highlighting several
stages in 18th century chamber
music, with one 20th century
piece.

Trios in the realm of classical
music usually consist of violin,
cello and piano, or three str-
ings. The St. Germain Trio
replaces the violin with a flute.
It has the advantage of being a
novel combination but also the
' considerable disadvantage of a
very limited repertory from
which to draw.

Pauline Lederer, the pianist,
said in a conversation before
the concert that the group sup-
pliments the repertory by
transcribing pieces to suit its in-
strumentation, or substitutes
the flute for the violin, as in the
opening work, W.A. Mozart's
‘Trio inC Major,”’ K. 548.

The Mozart piece, written in
1788, is a fine classical exam-
ple: two bright Allegros
separated by a stately Andante
cantablile, with delicate  or-
naments from the French
rococo style. The cellist, Ettie
Minor, played with smooth
phrasing and Lederer mastered
the piano’s. formidable
technical demands. But
although Deborah Nathan, the
flutist, played with bright tone
and dynamic power, the flute
seemed to lack the ‘‘bite’’ of the
violin, and its ability to blend in-

to a delicate balance with the
other voices.

In the “Trio for Flute, ‘Cello
and Piano,” by Carl Maria von
Weber, however, a fine in-
terplay between the voices was
achieved. This piece is neo-
Classical; the piano’s subtle
shifts between dark and light
moods, subtly executed by
Lederer, foreshadow the
Romantic period. The third
movement, entitled ‘‘Shep-
herd’s Lament,’’ features a
beautiful, slow melody,
developed in turn by the flute,
the piano, and the cello. The
warmth of tone from Minor’s
cello was especially appealing.

_The third work, from the ear-
ly 1700’s, was Jean Marie
Leclair’s ‘‘Sonate a Trois in D
Major.’’ The pattern of
movements is typical of the
Italian Baroque (slow-fast-
slow-fast), and, like the Mozart
trio, it shows the French in-
fluence of ornamentation.

The program. finished with
“Trio for Flute, ‘Cello . and
Piano,”’ by Bochuslav Martinu,
a Czech who emigrated to the
United States in 1941. Martinu
writes in a modern idiom, but
with simplicity and lyricism.
The Trio is a fresh mixture of
bitonality and syncopated
rhythms, with several
humorous deceptions and a sur-
prise finish. In the Poco
allegretto, each instrument
takes an independent course,
only to rejoin the others, from
time to time, in a rich melange.
In this difficult piece, the per-
formers’ phrasing and unity
seemed particularly fine.

The attractive and vivacious
trio treated an appreciative au-
dience to a Telemann ‘‘Vivace”’
as anencore.

—~—*The Country Wife’

by Todd Jones

Washington and Lee Theatre
Department’s first production
of the year, The Country Wife,
is a restoration comedy. The
play, written in 1765, deals with
adultery between friends,
within the tradition of the
period.

Much of the action centers
around Mr. Horner, portrayed
by Craig Walker. Mr. Horner,
at the beginning of the show, an-
nounces that he has gone to
France, and after an operation,
has returned a eunuch. The au-
dience finds out that he is ac-
tually lying, so that he may
seduce men’s wives without the
men being worried about him
being in their wives’ company.
Walker presents his lines clear-
ly and concisely, and makes his
part quite interesting.

One of the friends whom
Horner ‘cuckolds’ is Sir Jasper
Fidget, played by Chris Cart-
mill. Cartmill has one of the
more humorous parts, and
delivers most of his lines in a
high, squeaky voice. His man-
nerisms were very funny, and
delighted the audience.

A special Virginia Museum
exhibition, ‘‘Oriental Splendor:
Japanese and Chinese Decora-
tive Arts,” opens Tuesday,
November 17, in Washington
and Lee University’s duPont
Gallery.

The 29-object show is co-
sponsored by W&L and the
Rockbridge Chapter of the
Virginia Museum. It will re-

ZOLLMAN’S PAVILLION

While much of the action was
going on between Horner and
his friends, another plot was go-
ing on at the house of Mr. Pinch-
wife. Mr. Pinchwife and his
sister live together. He is trying
to arrange a marriage for his
sister and Mr. Sparkish. Pinch-
wife, played by Chris Lillja,
was effective as a brisk, angry,
demanding husband-brother,
but stomped around the stage
just a little bit too much. Mr.
Sparkish, played by Chuck
Turner had many resemblences
to Mr. Cartmill in his acting. He
spoke in a high-pitched voice,
and had many of the same man-
nerisms.

The sister, Alithea, played by
Paula Langdon put in an ex-
cellent performance. Her lines
were well delivered, and made
her part very believable. The
sister’s other love interest,
played by Brandon Davis, also
put in an excellent perfor-
mance. The dialogues between
the two of them were among the
best in the show.

Another good performance
was offered by Priscilla Lewis,

cember 17.

‘For the most part these ob-
jects are not fraught with deep,
complex meaning. Rather they
exist to please, to charm and to
give delight,’’ said Dr. Joseph
M. Dye III, exhibition curator
and Asiatic art expert for the
Virginia Museum.

ferent cultural and _ historical
contexts. Some belong to court

as Mr. Pinchwife’s wife. She is
from the country, hence the title
of the play. Her accent was ob-
viously different from all the
rest of the members of the cast.
She delivered some of the fun-
niest lines in the play.

The three ladies that Horner
entreats, among others, were
played by Betty Kahn, Alisa Le-
vien, and Ginger McNeese. Also
in the cast was Professor Shill-
ington, who played a doctor,
who ‘“‘would never make a good
chemist.”’

Also included in the cast are
Greg Mausser, Andy Berisford,
Virginy Loper, Peter Moody.

The set, designed by Tom
Ziegler, was quite effective, and
very free-flowing. The play was

directed by Al Gordon.

The Country Wife, is well-
acted, but might create a few
problems because it is perform-
ed in its original form, possibly
much like it was in 1675. The

goalie, and scored on a shot that
the goalie only managed to tip,
the game was all but over.

The Generals added three
goals in the fourth, two by
Johnstone, before Richmond
scored again with 1:05 left to
play. Freshman Bobby Pearson
and Peterson then tallied one
apiece to provide the final
margin.

Johnstone was the Generals’
leading scorer with four goals,
and he explained that ‘being
left-handed gives me a big ad-
vantage with the right post”’ in
that he can just catch the ball
and shoot, whereas a right-
handed player would have to
backhand the shot.

Remillard explained his
team’s uncharacteristically
poor first-half showing by say-
ing, ‘We were still thinking
about the big win yesterday
(over Richmond by a score of
14-6 in the second round), and
we didn’t prepare for a tough
opponent.”’

When the Generals fell behind
early, ‘‘We tried to get back
right away, and we didn’t work
as a team,’’ said Remillard.

 

 

Sports

 

 

‘‘As we let down, it allows an
average defense to be effective.
We did not pursue, and we did
not put on defensive pressure.”

Once again, Remillard cited
his defense as ‘preventing us
from getting blown over.”’

Washington and Lee converted -

on 40 percent of their six-on-five
opportunities for the game
while Richmond only made
good on 33 percent. In addition,
goalie Andy Gates stopped 79
percent of the shots fired at

him.

Six first quarter goals, three
by Peterson, had propelled the
Generals to a 14-6 victory over
Richmond in the second round
on Saturday. Although the
Spiders mounted a small come-
back in the second quarter by
outscoring the Generals 4-1,
three W&L goals in less than a
minute in the third quarter kill-
ed the rally. The first of these
came when Rock arched a high
lob from the left side of the pool,
over the goalie’s head and into
the right corner of the net.

Peterson connected on 75 per-
cent of his shots to lead the
Generals with six goals for the
game. Rock finished with 3
tallies, and Gates stopped 71
percent of Richmond’s shots.

100 percent is the best way to
describe the Generals’ first

round 24-7 win over James
Madison University. W&L
scored on all of their six-on-five
opportunities, an area of their
game that has given them some

problems throughout the
season. In addition, goalie Andy
Gates, playing only the first
half, stopped 100 percent of the
shots fired at him. In fact, his
hardest job was extricating an

| unwanted insect from the pool

before the game began. Also,
Peterson hit on all of his shots
en route to scoring five goals.

The Generals scored eight
goals in the first quarter, six of
them coming as a direct result
of steals, to end the game before
it ever really got started. Mc-
Clain tied with Peterson for the
scoring lead with five goals and
Rock, senior Mike Bernot, and
Keith Kadesky each tallied
three times.

In games not involving W&L,
Richmond defeated Duke in the
first round, 14-6. Duke then
dropped to the loser’s bracket,
where they eliminated James
Madison, 20-9. Richmond fell to
the loser’s bracket following
their first loss to the Generals
and eliminated Duke, 13-9, to
advance to the Sunday morning
final.

three games to up his season

The Washington and Lee soc-

season by dropping a pair of

defeating Virginia Wesleyan
College 3-2 last Wednesday.

Brad Poorman’s score, with
an assist from Jerry Moyer,
gave the Generals the lead thir-

at 1-1 early in the second half,
Roland Simon connected for an
unassisted goal before Tom

Simon and Rob Coleman put
W&L ahead to stay.

team leader in both goals, with
six, and assists (five), meaning
he contributed to over half of
the 20 goals the Generals
managed this year. Moyer (two
goals and three assists), Elder
(two goals), and Poorman
(three goals) also led the
Generals’ attack.

Keeper Kirk Mancer, who
was able to keep the score
respectable in every game
despite the low offensive output,
was mainly responsible for
holding the opposition to an
average of just over two goals
per game. Only in the Lynch-
burg (4-1) and UVa. games
were the Generals never in con-
tention for a least a tie.

likewise impressive in the
limited action in goal he had.

Saturday’s contest with Rich-
mond on Wilson Field may have
been W&L’s biggest disappoint-
ment, considering they could
not score against a team with a
record of 1-14. But after the
Spiders took the lead in the
opening two minutes, the best
the Generals could manage
were a pair of thirty footers
from the right side by Simon,
both of which just missed the
far right corner of the Rich-
mond goal.

The Generals held the na-
tionally ranked Cavaliers (who
dominated Richmond ]1-0 a
month earlier) scoreless for the
first ten minutes before UVa.
broke it open with a couple of
scores 25 seconds apart from
each other. Gindhart took over

The Generals now advance to
the Eastern Intercollegiate
Championships at Brown Uni-
versity at Providence, RI, this
weekend, where they are seed-
ed fifth and will open the
tourney against, you guessed it,
Slippery Rock, the fourth seed.
The other first round matches
are (with seeds in parentheses )
Chicago-Loyola (1) vs. Rich-
mond (8), Brown (2) vs. Prin-
cipia (7), and Fordham (3) vs.
Harvard (6).

Remillard described the
W&L-Slippery Rock match as a
“toss-up’’ because the Rockets
are “bummed out’’ about not
being seeded higher, and it is
difficult to beat a team four
times ‘in a season (Slippery
Rock has won the previous
three games between the teams
by scores of 13-5, 10-8, and 12-8).
In addition, the pool at Brown is
all-deep with no shallow end, a
factor that should help the
Generals’ strong-swimming
club.

The third-year coach sum-
med up the team’s hopes for
this weekend just as he did
before the season began. ‘“‘We
are not a one-man team (teams
that have tried double-teaming
Peterson have not met with
much success),’’ he said.
“Teamwork is our ticket.”’

Gridders Keep Streak,
Down Catholic, 24-10

by Dale Park

The Washington and Lee var-
sity football team scored on its
first two possessions and went
onto a 24-10 win over Catholic
University last Saturday in
Washington, D.C. The triumph
was W&L’s fifth consecutive
and assured the team its best
record since an 8-1 mark in 1962.

W&L took a 14-0 lead in the
first quarter when quarterback
Al Paradise connected with
tight end Mike Fogarty for a
six-yard scoring pass to cap a
49-yard drive and tailback Chris
Cavalline dove in from one yard
out to finish a 48-yard drive.

Late in the second quarter the
Generals intercepted a Car-
dinal pass. W&L capitalized
several plays later when
Cavalline hit Paradise with a
32-yard touchdown toss that
made it 21-0 at halftime.

“‘T was really pleased with the
way we played in the first half,”’
commented head coach Gary
Fallon.

   

Gene Newton (No. 41) press

“We really didn’t

ures the Catholic quarterback (Scott

tighten up in the second half,
but our penalties and turnovers
not only kept us from getting on
track but got Catholic fired up.”

Relying principally on a pass-
ing game, Catholic mounted a
second-half comeback which
netted ten third quarter points,
including a sixty-yard touch-
down drive.

The Cardinals completed 23 of
43 passing attempts for 210
yards but Catholic also suffered
four interceptions, two of which
led to W&L scores.

The W&L defense stiffened in
the final period, and Bill Devine
added a 42-yard field goal in the
quarter. Devine’s effort, a
career best, tied him for the
single-season mark for field
goals at seven.

“We’re pleased to have a
good record and to have had
good performances in our re-
cent games,’’ said Fallon. “But
we still need to meet Saturday’s
challenge and to finish the
season on a high note.”’

“Saturday’s challenge’ will
be the Georgetown Hoyas.
Georgetown, a Division III in-
dependent, will bring a 6-2
record and a four game win
streak to Lexington.

Last season, W&L routed
Georgetown 36-7, rolling up 444
yards total offense and its
highest point production in
three seasons.

“Yet,” warned Fallon,
“‘we’re telling our players not to
judge Georgetown by that game
last season. Instead, they
should look at the Hoyas overall

record this season.”’

Five Qualify

 

by Rick Swagler

In cross-country, a fourth
place finish in a field of six
teams signifies that the team
ran poorly.

The W&L cross-country team
did everything but have a poor
race and still managed to finish
fourth in the annual ODAC
Championship held this year at
Bridgewater College. As Coach
Dick Miller said, ‘We all ran
well, but we just didn’t run fast
enough.”

Finishing first for the
Generals and seventh overall
was Angus McBryde with a
time of 26:33. Frank Pittman
placed 11th overall and second
for the Generals, turning in a
26:57. The third W&L finisher
was Jon Kelafant in 19th place
with a 27:53. Steve Whetzle and

Greg Branan rounded out the

Generals’ top five, finishing
22nd and 23rd _ respectively.
Whetzle had a time of 28:00, and
Branan was close behind with a
28:16.

It was a very fast and com-
petitive meet, with only 18
seconds separating the overall
winner from W&L’s first
finisher, McBryde. By finishing
in the top seven, McBryde was
named All-Conference. Mc-

Harriers Fourth In ODAC

Bryde, Pittman, Kelafant,
Whetzle, and Branan will all be
running in the Southeastern
Regionals at Fisk University in
Nashville on Saturday.

Pittman commented that ‘‘we
don’t stand a chance of going to
the Nationals. We’re going for
the experience.” Miller is
slightly more optimistic, saying
‘‘we might get some individuals
qualified for the Nationals.”’

The final standings in the
ODAC are (1) Roanoke College;
(2) Lynchburg College; (3)
Eastern Mennonite College; (4)
W&L; (5) Bridgewater College
and (6) Hampden-Sydney Col-
lege. The Generals have never
placed higher than fourth in the
ODAC Championship and Mc-
Bryde is the first General to win
All-Conference honors in cross-
country.

With the Generals losing only
one runner in the top five (Cap-
tain Branan) and one other run-
ner (Tony Ierardi), the future
looks bright for the Generals.
Rumors as to the Generals’
freshman prospects are as
widespread as usual, but as
Miller said, ‘I don’t count on
anybody until they are enrolled,
have picked up their equip-
ment, and are running.”

Snookers Finish At 3-1

by Charlie Alcorn

This year’s junior varsity
gridders compiled a 3-1 record
which is far and away the best
season they have had since the
j.v. program was initiated four
years ago. First year head
coach John Bowers served as
head and has had great help
from his staff. The turn around
from past years’ horrendous
performances is attributed to
the great emphasis placed on
the program and the stellar per-
formances by this year’s
freshmen recruits and seasoned
sophomores.

The year started on a dreary
note when the team lost their

“first game to Division one

James Madison 36-0. Three
straight victories followed, 14-6
over Massanutten Prep, 27-7
over Western Maryland and 3-0
over arch rival Hampden
Sydney in Farmville.

Some. of this year’s offensive
Stars included quater back-
kicker John Thompson,
tailback Gene Girard and Dan
Jayne as well as tailback Tom
Wiser. A host of young linemen
did an outstanding job in the

trenches. The defensive stan-

douts incuded Mary Monasco

and Jim Lyall on the line,
linebackers Kurt Speck and
Roger Dunnavan, defensive
ends and backs Billy Morrow,
Dave Warrenfeltz and Ronnie
Travers.

The junior varsity team is not
a single entity like most major
college teams. The players are
integral parts components in
the W&L varsity scheme also.
J.V. players provide the first
team with much needed ‘‘look”’
work during the week-day prac-
tices. Most j.v. players do not
get to play in the varsity games

    

 

HUFFMAN’S

mainly because of a new league
rule allowing a player to com-
pete in only eleven games, var-
sity and j.v. combined. The sub-
varsity games give players an
opportunity to show their wares
and serve as a springboard to
varsity action for some.

The junior varsity program
serves as a barometer for
future team’s potential. While
the W&L varsity is having one
of its best seasons in years.
things look good on the horizor:
too due to the performances anc
dedication of the 1981 junior
varsity team. Congatulations

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Don't Nobody Bring
Me No Bad News

When no one complained after the last issue, we figured it must
have really been a masterpiece. Our judgment was premature and
selfish, and finding nothing particular to humiliate us with, the
readership offered their observations about the Phi and journalism
in the broad sense.

‘*The newspaper here sucks,”’ according to Bill Roberts.

‘‘Why do you harp on the negative aspects?’ is the question on
people’s minds as their mammoth intellects lament the absense of
the campus comic strip, and as they turn to the editorial page,
salivating to see who is roasted this week.

The Inter-Fraternity Council dislikes our coverage so much that
‘t appointed two Public Relation Newshandlers to cover them for
us. The president of the Executive Committee and most of the rest
of the round table holds us partly to blame for the failure of some
amendments in last month’s referendum.

We should merge with the Law News, suggested an E.C. member
during the budget hearings. That way, we could work with ‘‘grown
men and women” and learn gobs about how real newspapers work.

When the president of the National News Service mentioned that

ollege newspapers were generally sophomoric, he got a tremen-
ous laugh from his audience of W&L professors and students.
-veryone turned to rib the Phi news editors in the audience.
‘oberts told him that the Phi was no good, and what did he think of

Roberts was referred to the campus Pulitzer winner, but the
Prizewinner doesn’t follow the Phi very well. The head of the
department had no comment: ‘‘The paper is strictly...extracur-
ricular.”’

Our humble staff is not trendy enough for this electric campus.
You call for Moral Uprighteousness, and we send your parents a
prophylactic ad. You call for Freedom of Expression, and we screw
the Country Wife.

The Executive Committee gave money to a Christian Fellowship,
but by the time we had gotten our typesetter in gear, they had taken
the money back.

But keep those cards and letters coming. We don’t care. We know
you are just handling the abuse so we won’t have to. We know it is
all just a satire to subtly hint to us what real nattering nabobs of
negativism are like. We know you love us. Or, at least, love to hate

Football Player Urges Attendance

Dear Sir:

I’m writing in regards to the
last game of the 1981 W&L foot-
ball season. At 1:30, this Satur-
day afternoon, the Generals will
host Georgetown on Wilson
Field in a quest for their sixth
consecutive victory and their
eighth overall. As strange as it
seems to me, a member of the
team, the stands will probably
be more empty than full.

I understand that the students

- are not obligated to support the

team..I realize that we are only
division three and far from the
glory and glamour of big time
college football. I know we're
not hoping for a_ bowl bid

lothe editor

   

against Pitt, Clemson, Texas or
any such teams. And on Satur-
day no one will crown a Home-
coming Queen. But in spite of
all that will be absent, it seems
to me the game would be an at-
tractive event to attend.

A victory against Georgetown
would conclude the Generals’
season with a record of eight
wins, two losses — the best at
W&L in nearly two decades.
And in fact, such a record may
earn the Generals a bid to the
divison three national playoffs.
Indeed, it’s probably fair to say
that losing seasons at W&L are
a thing of the past. With last
year’s record of 6-4, and a
guaranteed winning season this
year, over 60 percent of this

year’s squad will never have ex-
perienced a losing season at
Washington and Lee.

Finally, even though we play
for fun and for our own
gratification, support from our
schoolmates can be very uplift-
ing. Imagine how discouraging
it was to come out. after
halftime against Maryville, on
October 10, and find the fans
recrossing the footbridge in
droves. Now, Maryville was the
national offensive leader in
Division III averaging over 500
yards and around 40 points per
game. At the half, the Generals
had them shut out 14-0. Obvious-

[4

ly, the fans came to see the
Homecoming festivities. That’s
a painfully significant state-
ment on the respect the
students have for the team. But
perhaps size and stellar athletic
ability are not the most justified
objects of respect. Consider the
effort and dedication shared by
the football team.

We take pride in what we've
accomplished and in what we
are. We play tough, exciting
football and Saturday’s game
should be most enjoyable. |
hope we'll have your support.

Sincerely,
Bob Jenevein

 

Dear Sir:

This letter is in response to
the editorial that appeared in
the Phi ‘‘Country Ethics.”

While the posters used to
publicize ‘‘The Country Wife’
can be interpreted to have sex-
ual connotations, the innuendos
are obviously in the eye of the
beholder. The design of the
posters are typical of patterns
used during the Restoration
period for such everyday things
as wallpaper, tapestries, and
the like. If your eye detects
something objectionable in the
design, it is due to your defec-
tive sense of aesthetics, and not
an over-zealous publicity crew.

While half of the Phi staff is
looking up the word aesthetics
to see if it means something dir-
ty, I would suggest that the
other half might look at past

 

Reader Says Phi Has
Defective Aesthetics

issues of the Phi, namely the
first issue of the year. Making
jokes about contraceptive
devices was something most of] ©
us were fortunate enough to
leave behind in grade school.
Obviously, a few people on the
Phi staff never progressed
beyond that level.

While ‘‘The Country Wife’’
may have been bawdy enough
to elicit censorship in its own
time, it’s a sad commentary on
our society if we haven’t pro-
gressed beyond a 17th century
tolerance for fun.

Keep watch, all guardians of
morality at the Phi. We may
have a two for one sale on
‘Country Wife’’ posters, just
for you.

Sincerely,
Christopher M. Lillja

Two At-Large Members
Rescinded By E.C.

(continued from page 1)
from their status as members
at large to the Publications
Board. Dawson, Lang, Hale and
John Vlahoplus, ’83 Rep., voted
against.

Debate on how to interpret
the relationship between Pub
Board and E.C. was tabled for a
later date.

:Honor Related Matters?

The E.C. voted unanimously
against letting the student body
overturn an honor case decision
by referendum. The subcom-
mittee had looked at a section of
the constitution which allowed
students to over-rule “‘any ac-
tion of...the Executive Commit-
tee,’’ and felt that ‘‘any action’’
included honor trials.

“Oh! that would be horribly
dangerous,”’ said Myers.

Vlahoplus agreed that honor
was covered in the White Book
and not the constitution, and
called such an interpretation
“‘mobocracy.”’

Morgan Griffith, ’83L Rep.,
noted that in dealing with the
honor system, they were agents
of the Trustees, and not student
body officers.

The E.C. appointed a
treasurer with a $1 per year
salary to comply with the con-
stitutional referendum of Oc-
tober. The treasurer is a
bookkeeper in Washington Hall,
who has been handling E.C.
funds for some time.

Percentage Budgets

The Committee voted 8-4 to
amend the constitution to delete
that student body funds should
be distributed according to a
percentage basis. What: this
meant, the Committe could not

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity journalism professor Clark
Mollenhoff will be the guest
speaker for the annual
Woodrow Wilson Luncheon of
the Woodrow Wilson Birthplace
Foundation Wednesday at the
Ingleside Club in Staunton.

Mollenhoff’s speech is entitl-
ed “Accountability in Govern-
ment: A Perspective from
Woodrow Wilson to Ronald
Reagan.” A Pulitzer Prize win-

Griffith said it had to do with
the old practice of giving the
Law School the amount of stu-
dent body taxes that it had con-
tributed. Griffith said that the
practice was too cumbersome
and complex to continue.

Vlahoplus said that the E.C.
already considers, ‘‘in the back
of our minds during budget
hearings,’ the percentage of
students served by an organiza-
tion. :

In other action, the E.C.
heard from Karl Sening,
chariman of the Cold Check
Committee.

The Cold Check Committee’s
treasurer had been called in
earlier in the year to answer
questions from Myers. Sening
said that he had sent out a
newsletter informing mer-
chants of his policies, as re-
quested by the E.C.

Ring-tum Phi Business
Manager : Trent Dickerson
reported that advertising was
down from last year, but that
the paper was as good as last
year’s.

There were no questions from
the E.C. about the quality of the
newspaper.

Viahoplus moved that Griffith
investigate several legal deci-
sions that have possible impact
on the W&L honor system. That
motion, and another that will
pay for copying costs, passed.

Hale reported that President
Robert E.R. Huntley had told
him, ‘“‘There’s no way in hell
anybody’s ever gonna know the
legal implications of our honor
system, and you boys don’t need
to worry about it.”’

Mollenhoff was formerly
Washington bureau chief for the

Save for the private lines
secured by reporters indepen-

a lone pay phone we found in a

below the party. Fortunately a

the family was breaking down.

Kirk Follo, Professor ef Ger-
man, finds in the series a
salutary antidote to the Herman
Hesse view of the East, which
implies that the highest forms
of consciousness and wisdom
are omnipresent there. The
German novelist Hesse, author,
for example, of Siddhartha, was
widely-read on American cam.
puses in the 60’s, when it was
popular to search for an alter-

directly from the podium. Our
spot was 30 feet from the
device. Our patch cord was two
feet long. Again, help came
from nearby reporters who
allowed us to patch into their
tape recorder. One of them said
he got his start at WLUR. He
must have understood our

predicament.

At times we wondered just
how useful our presence in
Richmond was. As one Rich-
mond reporter said, ‘‘There’s
no news here, except you might
get drunk or laid.’’ But other
reporters seemed amazed that
a school station would pay to
send four reporters that far
away. (Eric Fife and David
Donahue covered the
Republican ‘‘celebration.’’)

Our presence in Richmond
even allowed us to scoop some
of the real stations that evening.

is particularly pleased to have

“Through this exceptional
outreach effort by the Virginia
Museum, we are able to present

As we phoned in a routine
report the crowd was told that
the Associated Press and
United Press International had
just declared Robb the winner.
Other reporters went scrambl-
ing to call in the story. In the
process, though, we wore out
our welcome with one of the two
reporters who allowed us use of
a phone on the ballroom floor.
We hung up to allow her to call
her station in Washington.
Unfortunately for her (and us)
the operator stayed on the line
for five minutes trying to
clarify the details of who was to
be billed for the call.

She missed her newscast. We
missed getting to use her phone
the rest of the evening.

The other reporter went live
for the rest of the evening, thus
costing us the use of the other
phone available to us. So it was

back to the pay phone-in-
the-deserted-ballroom-a-flight-
of-stairs-away. The echo of the
empty room replaced the noise
of the screaming crowd of the
floor above. So much for effect.

Several other reporters used
that phone, as well. And most of
them — and most of the rest of
the reporters we came in con-
tact with — were more than
helpful. They must have
remembered being in our shoes
at one time.

A reporter from a Dallas
newspaper was not so helpful.
But a touch of poetic justice
came as we called in our final
report: He appeared in -the
room, hurrying to meet his
deadline. But he had to wait for
us to complete our report.

But other reporters had their
troubles, too. During Robb’s ac-
ceptance speech, a_ portable

television camera’s _ battery
pack died. The camera man
spiked it. Another technician
was seen crawling under tables
amidst dozens of wires and
cables. He had to plug in an ex-
tension cord.

WLUR and Cable Nine left the
air shortly after Robb’s ap-
pearance early Wednesday
morning. But the elated
Democratic partiers continued
much longer.

The reporters and the
Democrats had remained
separate during the evening
despite the physical closeness
to each other in the sardine-like
ballroom. But once the cameras
were packed up and the stories
were called in, the two seemed
to merge into a single party —
celebrating the end of a long
evening (and campaign) and a
long-awaited victory.

Investigators Suspect Arson

As Cause Of Sigma Nu Fire

by Patrick Jordan

A suspicious early-morning
fire broke out at the Sigma Nu
fraternity Saturday causing
damage to the basement and
first two floors of the house.

According to Bryan Causey,
Chief of the Lexington Fire
Department, the blaze started
and was contained in the base-
ment of the house, but smoke
reached the second floor of the
structure. Causey said no
damage estimates had yet been
made.

Causey said that a State Ar-
son Bureau investigator from
Salem had completed a
preliminary investigation by
Saturday afternoon and had

concluded that the fire was
“suspicious in nature and that
arson could have been involv-
ed.”

Findings from a second in-
vestigation conducted by Salem
Arson Bureau investigator L.R.
Thomas on Monday afternoon
have also yet to be released.

Lexington Police Officer
Torben Pedersen said an
unknown male called police
about 4:30 a.m. to report a fire
“at one of the fraternity houses
on Henry Street, but he did not
know which.’’ Pedersen said the
man failed to identify himself.

William C. Datz, assistant
Washington and Lee University
proctor, had accompanied

 

Smoke rose from the basement of the SNU house and caused this

damage in the living room.

Thomas during part of the se-
cond investigation completed at}
the fraternity.

“Apparently, two fires hadi
originated in the basement of
the fraternity,’’ Datz said. ‘‘One
had started in the right front
part of the basement while
another had broken out directly
underneath the kitchen.”’

Datz said he noticed several
cans of flammable liquid in the
basement and he added that
some chairs and bookcases had
been piled up in the corner of
the basement.

According to Lewis John,
Dean of Students at W&L, no
Sigma Nu fraternity members
have been living in the house
since June 8.

In addition, John dismissed a
rumor that several townspeople

~had periodically lived in the

basement at Sigma Nu.

House members were evicted
as a result of an order from the
Student Affairs Committee
(SAC), principally because of
poor living conditions and a
failure to pay past financial
obligations.

John said the house has run
up debts amounting to close to
$7000 to local merchants and the
fraternity owes approximately
$25,000 in mortgage payments
to the University.

John added that on Nov. 10,

 

The SNU house has been placed off-limits as investigators ex-
amine the cause of Saturday’s fire.

the SAC withdrew recognition
of the Washington and Lee
Chapter of the fraternity.

According to Maurice §Lit-
tlefield, the Executive Director
of Sigma Nu, a recommenda-
tion haS been forwarded to
Sigma Nu board members that
the national chapter assume the
debts owed to the University.

Littlefield said he has receiv-
ed some early indications that
the national board will approve
the motion.

Littlefield added that the
debts to the merchants incurred
by the W&L chapter could not
be paid by the national fraterni-
ty.

According to John, Littlefield
has expressed an interest in

rebuilding the fraternity with a
new nucleus of members.

The 100th anniversary of the
founding of Sigma Nu at
Washington and Lee will be
next year.

In a separate incident, Sigma
Nu treasurer John Solitario said
the book containing records of
the fraternity’s debts is miss-
ing.

Solitario.said he had kept the
records in his apartment at 114
E. Nelson St.

He said he noticed that the
records were missing Thursday
night and that he contacted the
Coordinator of Fraternity Af-
fairs Dan Murphy about the
disappearance the following
day.

 

 

SPJ’s Washington To-Do:

Interesting,

by John Wells

All things considered, the
three-day convention of the
Society of Professional Jour-
nalists held in our nation’s
capital last week was an in-
teresting if wunriveting ex-'
perience. The location for the
conclave — a couple of blocks
from Capitol Hill and a brief
crow’s fly from the White House

 

— made it far less lacklustre
than some previous conven-
tions. The brewing situations
surrounding administration
figures David Stockman and
Richard Allen lent an air of
real-life drama to proceedings
which were otherwise pretty
unreal.

The setting for the goings-on
was Washington’s Hyatt Regen-

Unriveting

cy Hotel, probably as ugly and
outrageously expensive
stopover as one could possibly
imagine. Our not very spacious
room contained no stationery,
an enormous orange lamp and
an anemic-looking plant with a
sign saying ‘‘Don’t Water Me.”
Cute. Carla Hall of the
Washington Post summed up
the Hyatt’s decor in a sentence
describing conventioneers ‘“‘sip-
ping coffee at tables adorned
with orange fabric flowers in
plastic pots.”” Guests were ex-
pected to become drunk with
extravagance over such
hifalutin’ freebies as Hyatt bath
bouquet containing real mink
oil.

Following registration
Wednesday evening, SPJ
members wandered around the
Hill until they found the Russell
building, where the Senate
Caucus Room was the site of a
champagne reception for the
arriving guests. The event was
supposed to be hosted by
Senators Mathias and Warner,
and the crowd was full of
whispered curiosity (‘‘I wonder

Crash Inquiry At Standstill

by Patrick Jordan
Lexington Police officers
have reached a standstill in
their investigation into how a
patrol car mysteriously rolled
and hit a brick wall Oct. 3 dur-
ing a fraternity party.

THE END?

 

According to Lexington
Police Officer Torben Ped-
ersen, a few leads are still being
pursued but he said most in-
quiries have reached ‘‘a
waiting-game stage.”

Pedersen said that the police
department is still concen-
trating its efforts on the
assumption that a Washington
and Lee student is responsible
for the wreck.

Pedersen had entered the
Sigma Nu fraternity house
about 1:00 a.m. to close down a
band for playing too loud.

Pedersen said that he parked
the patrol car in front of the
house at 4 Henry St., put the
transmission in park, removed
the keys and left the doors
unlocked before entering the
fraternity.

After stopping the band,
Pedersen said he returned five
minutes later to discover his
car smashed against the war
memorial at the entrance of
W&L University. Damage to the
car was estimated at $1000.

Pedersen said he has ques-
tioned several students who
contend that they saw another
student dressed in a ‘‘preppy
manner” get into the police car
and shift it out of park.

University Proctor Charles
Murray, who is assisting the
Lexington Police Department
in the case, said that although
some admitted seeing this stu-
dent get into the patrol car,
none have been able to identify
him.

Pedersen explained that
although the Ford model patrol

 

car has an inherent mechanical
problem in the transmission, it
would have taken some force to
have initiated the car’s move-
ment down the street in front of
the fraternity.

Pedersen said because of the
mechanical defect, the car can
be taken out of park when the
keys are out of the ignition.

But Pedersen emphasized

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Pe

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Rambling Thoughts

One of the less pleasant aspects of putting out a
paper this week is the realization that only half of the
campus will be around on Thursday afternoon and
Friday to read this. Anyway, here are a few thoughts
that our staff compiled when trying to come up with
an editorial:

- Perhaps no SNU news is indeed good news, as last
Saturday’s fire demonstrates. With the Beta couch-
torching of a few weeks ago and now the SNU blaze,
Red Square has been making life hectic for the Lex-
ington Fire Department on Saturdav nights. Mean-
while, the SNU rumor mills continue to grind out in-
teresting iotas, including the one that the brotherhood
has dissolved. If this is the case, will the boys regroup
for their centennial which occurs in the near future?

- Both the football and water polo squads finished
their respective seasons with higher-than-expected
achievements. The football team won eight, lost two,
and won its conference. The polo men (don’t worry,
we won’t call you mermen) won 31 games, the most
by any team on the east coast. Oh}yés, we'll mention
the cross-country team which: scored big in its
regional meet. We don’t mean to slight you, believe it
or not.

Isn’t Thanksgiving a really neat holiday? And isn’t
the weather in Lexington really neat?’ And isn’t it
really neat that most of us have three tests and five
papers due by 5 p.m. Friday? And isn’t it neat that we
don’t have school for a week? And isn’t it neat that we
can incorporate all these really neat raat into one
incredibly neat editorial?

See you in two weeks.

Is The Phi A Chauvinist Pig?

Dear Sir:

I,wish to register a protest
about ;the “cartoon” that ap-
peared in the Oct. 29 issue of the
Phi, The drawing, prominently
located on the top of the front
page of the Parent’s Weekend
issue, depicted a student with
his parents.

Connected to each figure’ s
head was a balloon apparently
indicating that person’s
thoughts. Above the student’s
head was a balloon enclosing a
drink and above the father’s
head was a dollar sign. But the
balloon above the mother’s
head was empty. The implica-
tion, of course, was that the
woman had no thoughts at all.

Naturally, this drawing an-

noyed many of the women on
campus and several of our male
colleagues have expressed
similar disgust. It is not that
this particular cartoon is
outrageously offensive. The

 

point is that the Phi regularly
prints equally stereotypical
material. The cartoon was not
even funny, and added nothing

to the article it accompanied.
Parts of your newspaper are
of a good quality. If you would
resist insulting your readers
with offensive pranks like that
cartoon, perhaps the remainder
would reach that level also.

Sincerely
Terry J. McKenney

Grad Praises Darrell’s Food

This letter was written by Bob

Mr. Jerry Darrell

Director of Food Service
Washington & Lee University
Lexington, Va. 24450 USA

Dear Mr. Darrell,

I just wanted to drop a quick
note expressing my apprecia-
tion.

I realize that while I was at
W&L I was fortunate in having
an outstanding food service, but
I never knew how outstanding
until I left Lexington. As you
may know, I’m presently at the
University of St. Andrews in
Scotland, and our eating ar-
rangement is a monstrosity !

Although I’m supposed to be
eating in the most exclusive
graduate dining hall, both the
quality of the food and staff is
surprisingly poor. For example,

every meal has potatoes, in-
cluding the chow mein which
comes on french fries! There
are no salads, no seconds, and
no second choices unless you

Our only beverage is water —

napkins for weeks.

So thanks, thanks for all the
salad bars, beverages, and
basically good meals. I can
assure you that your service
makes all the difference in a
college experience.

Take care,

E.C. Hears Symposium Details

by Todd Smith
A name-change for the In-
tellectual Symposium and plans

for its first year were presented .

to the Executive Committee
Monday night.

The E.C. also set a freshman
class meeting and heard
reports concerning the Publica-
tions Board, the Computer Club
and the Emergency Loan Com-
mittee.

Bill Archer, the new chair-
man of the Intellectual Sym-
posium Committee, reported
that the new name would be
“Focus: an Interdisciplinary
Symposium.’”’ The committee
plans to have monthly
‘“‘forums”’ to discuss non-
political matters of wide in-
terest. The first forum will treat
“Limited Nuclear War.’’ Each
forum topic will be discussed in
a “Journal” enlisting student
articles.

The Journal will also drum up
interest in the Spring term
‘“‘Mini-Symposium.’’ This event
will treat a theme, still open to
suggestions, and will revolve
around a ‘‘town meeting.’’ The
first symposium to conform to
the original recommendation
will come in 1986.

The original recommendation .

came from a Liberal Education
Committee, set up by the presi-
dent of the university. An ad hoc
group of the University Com-
mittee examined the problem
and set down its suggestions in
a white paper.

Tripp Brower, ’82 Rep., who
served on the ad-hoc commit-
tee, asked Archer if the white
paper was to be followed. Ar-
cher replied that it was useful,
but too ‘grandiose’ for this
year.

Ben Hale, ’84 Rep., and
Brower asked the committee to
bring faculty members into the
Symposium on a regular basis.
The E.C. suggested Halford
Ryan and Ramsey Martin as in-
terested professors.

Archer said that he had found
several interested faculty
members: David Bausum, Car-

ren Kaston, Steven Olson, Har-
rison Pemberton Jr., and
Thomas Williams who also
served on the committee.

A special meeting is being
planned for law students.

Honor and Exams

In other action, the E.C. voted
to call a meeting of the
freshman class. President Eric
Myers voiced concern that
students would begin to abuse
the honor system concerning
exams if the Committee failed
to effectively inform freshmen.
Last year’s E.C. did not hold a
class meeting.

The exam policy was loosen-
ed up several years ago by the
faculty to allow students to
schedule their exams as they
wished, said Myers.

“Professors here are not

usually willing to go along with
changes, for instance, pass-fail
courses, like other colleges,”
said Myers, warning that they
might rescind the policy if abus-
ed.

Pub Board

Ken Lang reported that The
Publications Board had
reinstated Rob Willis and Ed-
ward Gonsalves as_ student
representatives, without voting
rights.

The two had been rescinded
by the E.C. last week in an ef-
fort to comply with the Constitu-
tional referendum of late Oc-
tober. Lang reported that the
Pub Board had the positions
laid out in its own constitution.

Computer Club

Jay O’Brien reported that the

Computer Club had written its

constitution and applied for
membership in the National
Association of Computing
Machinery.

O’Brien said that Lee
Feldman had worked out a plan
with the Mock Convention, and
that the Convention’s computer
would be available to students
for tutoring sessions.

SELC

Eric Koltz reported that the
Emergency Loan Committee
had lent money to only two
students. He conceded that
“there may be a_ definite
knowledge problem’’ of
students unaware of the
available resources.

Koltz said that he had already
placed an advertisement in the
Ring-tum Phi this year alerting
students to the committee.

Mollenhoff Gives Testimony

Washington & Lee University
journalism professor Clark R.
Mollenhoff testified before a
Congressional subcommittee
last week on the use of ‘‘ex-
ecutive privilege’ by Interior
Secretary James Watt.

Mollenhoff told the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations of the House
Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee that Congress should
take “direct contempt of Con-
gress action against Secretary
Watt”’ for his refusal to provide
31 documents to the House Com-
mittee on Energy and Com-
merce.

“In the end,’’ said Mollenhoff,
“this will be a service to Mr.
Watt, President Reagan and the
taxpayers.”

Mollenhoff, a Pulitzer Prize-
winning investigative reporter
who formerly was Washington
bureau chief for the Des Moines
Register and Tribune, was in-
vited to testify as an expert
witness on the subject of ‘‘ex-
ecutive privilege.”. He has
closely followed the administra-

tions of seven U.S. presidents.

Referring to his experiences
with previous administrations
Mollenhoff told the subcom-
mittee that in the past 25'years
“one of the major impediments
to full investigations by Con-
gress has been the claim of ‘ex-
ecutive privilege’ laid down by
various agencies of govern-
ment. Most of the time the
claim of ‘executive privilege’
has been nothing but a cover-up
of corruption, mismanagement
or improprieties in various ex-
ecutive agencies and was not
the least in the national in-
terest.”

Mollenhoff argued that ‘“‘any
president who permits his
cabinet officers to use a claim
of ‘executive privilege’ to hide
information from Congress, is
taking a long step down a slip-
pery slope. He is opening a Pan-
dora’s Box in giving any sup-

port to this pernicious:doctrine,
and it will come back to haunt
him as it has past prrerent. .

Acknowledging that Presi-
dent Reagan ‘“‘still projects a
personal image’ of an honest,
forthright man,” Mollenhoff
said that even he ‘‘can seriously
damage that image and that
strength if it is perceived by the
public that he is not open and
forthright; if it is believed he is
permitting Cabinet officers to
use ‘executive privilege’ to
cover up questionable actions.”’

Mollenhoff had previously ap-

peared before Congressional
subcommittees as a witness on
the use of ‘executive priv-
ilege.” Last Friday he and
former Oversight and Investi-
gation subcommittee chairman
John Moss (D-Cal.) read
statements and were question-

Local Man

Arrested
In Fight

At Cockpit

by Patrick Jordan

A Lexington man was ar-
rested early Sunday morning
after a fight interrupted a rock
band performing at Washington
& Lee University’s Cockpit.

Paul Ruley, 36, of 299
\icLaughlin St., was arrested

ud charged with being drunk
. 1 public and resisting arrest in
connection with the early morn-
ing incident.

According to Bill Benson, a
manager at the Cockpit, Ruley
had tried to start a fight with a
performer in the rock band
“Late Shift”? during one of the
group’s breaks.

Benson said when the bass
player ignored Ruley’s request.
Ruley started to verbally abuse
the performer's girl friend who
then threw a beer in Ruley’s
face.

At this point, Benson said, the
band member came off the
stage and punched Ruley.

‘‘Some of the other attendants
at th.e Cockpit and I took Rule
outside toward the bathroom
and I locked the door behind us
so that the crowd would not
follow,’ Benson said. ‘I then
called the police and told them
to meet me _ outside of the

University Center.” +
According to Lexington
Police Officer Torben
Pedersen, some of Ruley’s

friends were trying to get him
into a car to go home, but he
was resisting their efforts.

Pedersen said the police hac!
no intention of arresting Rule,
initially and that they were in-
terested solely in breaking up
any additional fights.

According to Benson, while
Ruley was being escorted into
his girl friend’s car, he hit one
of the policemen with an errant
swing of his arm and also broke
one of the door windows.

Benson said the police then
handcuffed Ruley and placed
him ina police car.

Benson said Washington &
Lee University Proctor Charles
Murray will most likely issue
trespass warrants for Ruley
and two of his friends forbid-
ding them to come on campus
indefinitely.

Benson said this would be
done just to avoid any possibili-
ty of future disturbances.

Talk Of The Town

by John Cleghorn

There’s a barber in town who
can talk about just about
anything. He spends a lot of
time reading the paper and
keeping up with what’s going
on. When you sit in his chair he
can talk with you about any sub-
ject in any field you bring up;
your home town (if it’s sizeable
enough to make the news);
sports, the government, just
about anything.

Football came up last time
and, as usual, we covered the
field. The plight of VMI and the
clash of Lexington and B.V.
were the main topics of discus-
sion. When the Generals came
up, the conversation waned. He
knew they had been doing well
but he simply wasn’t used to
talking about W&L in the same
breath as these other successful
teams.

Well, this year the Generals
slipped up on him.

Throughout the season people
noticed a win here, a win there
but haven’t followed too closely,
lest it get boring. They find out
on Monday or Tuesday, by
chance, if the Generals won or
not. Pretty soon all these wins

added up and, what do you
know, they won the ODAC.
Maybe Washington & Lee ought
to borrow Rodney Dangerfield
from the University of
Maryland.

W&L was projected to win the
ODAC and they indeed did.
They won games they had to.
They didn’t choke and lose any
they weren’t supposed to, which
is not as easy as it sounds. They
developed a diversified and
threatening offense. The
defense evolved into the
strongest in the conference with
the ability to hold the Generals
in the lead once they gained it.
Hopefully, the Generals have
earned the respect they have
deserved all season.

While everybody is trying to
project who goes to which bowl
and who will end up as the
number-one team in college
football, they ought to keep in
mind that W&L has achieved
the same goal as Georgia and
SMU have and what Michigan
and USC might. Although W&L
has been voted out of post-
season play, it stands as the

best in the category it competes
in.

Gridders Stomp Georgetown ,

Named ODAC Champs

by Dale Park

Last Saturday, the
Washington & Lee varsity foot-
ball team exploded for 35
second-half points to crush
visiting Georgetown Universi-
ty, 43-15. In recording its sixth
consecutive triumph, W&L
finished its regular season at
8-2.

After the game the Generals
learned that, because of a 10-10
tie between rivals Randolph-
Macon and Hampden-Sydney,
W&L had become the Old
Dominon Athletic Conference
champion. The tie had knocked
Randolph-Macon out of the title
race, and W&L had become
champions by virtue of a win
over Maryville earlier this
season.

“It was a story-book finish,”
said head coach Gary Fallon. “‘I
hope it doesn’t happen just once
in a lifetime because we all had
a great day.”

The Generals certainly did
have a great day against the

Hoyas. W&L scored the first
two times they got the ball in
the third quarter; breaking
open an 8-8 halftime score to
move ahead for good. At the

game’s, end, the Generals had
scored on five of nine second-

half possessions, rolling up a,

season high 426 yards total
offense while picking off four
Georgetown passes.

Sophomore quarterback Al
Paradise led the way for the
Generals, scoring on runs of two
and three yards (including a
two-point conversion run) while
throwing touchdown passes of
14 yards to junior Jerry Thomp-
son and 72 yards to senior Mike
Fogarty.

Other W&L scorers included
junior Pat McGuire on a six-
yard run McGuire led all rush-

Regional Championships

Two HarriersIn Top Ten

by Rick Swagler

For the first time since 1978,
W&L has succeeded in placing a
man in the top ten of the NCAA
Division III Regional Cham-
pionships. In fact, this year, two
W&L runners finished in the top
ten.

Saturday, at Fisk University
in Nashville, Angus McBryde
led the Generals’ cross-country
team to a fourth place finish.
McBryde finished eighth with a
phenomenal time of 25: 47.1.

This is not to say, however,
that McBryde’s time was the
only fast one.

All five of the Generals mak-
ing the trip set personal records
at the meet. Frank Pittman
finished in the top ten also at
tenth place with a 25:58.5. Cap-
tain Greg Branan in his last
W&L cross-country meet finish-
ed 32nd with a 27:03.3. Fresh-
man Steve Whetzle finished 45th
with a 27: 47.7 time.

When asked about the results
of the meet, McBryde com-
mented that ‘‘we were kind of
surprised, to tell the truth. We
didn’t expect to do that well.”
McBryde predicts a first place
finish for the Generals in the

On defense, seniors Gene
Newton and Dick Cerone, junior
Gene Fellin and sophomore Bob
Jenevein each provided an in-
terception, with Newton’s and
Cerone’s coming in the end

“I’m happy for the team,”
commented Fallon, who com-
pleted his fourth season as W&L -
head coach. ‘I’m especially
happy for the 13 seniors who
were my first batch of recruits,
happy that they can finish as
winners after providing so
much of the effort which has
built this program. But with
them out of the picture we now
look to the ones who will replace
them next season. Those
players will need to be prepared
for a season in which our op-
ponents will probably put us on
a pedestal and fire away.”’

regionals next year. Incidental-
ly, that meet will be run at
Lynchburg College next year
and is tentatively scheduled to
come to the W&L course in 1986.
Frank Pittman commented
that ‘“‘the times were just in-
credible. We’ll be a lot tougher
next year.’”’ Captain Greg
Branan characterized the meet
as a “‘super sensational end to a
fantastic season. Everybody
pulled together this year.”’

Not surprisingly, the meet
pleased Coach Dick Miller. ‘“‘We
ran as well as we've run all
season. You can never com-
plain about a meet like that.
The team should be proud of the
whole season.”’

Miller noted that three out of
the top four teams at the
regionals were ODAC teams
—Roanoke College, second;
Lynchburg College, third; and
W&L, fourth. The University of
the South won the meet.

Looking forward to next
year’s NCAA Regionals at
Lynchburg, Miller has some
reservations about a big meet
on Lynchburg’s course. As it
stands, the Lynchburg course is
narrow in many places and has
too small a starting area for a
large number of runners.

Overall, the team finished
with an 8-3 record under the
leadership of Miller and
Branan, and next year the cap-
tain of the team will be Jon
Kelafant. As Branan comment-
ed, ‘‘I’m going to miss it. It’s go-
ing to be a lot different not runn-
ing competitively. I don’t know
if l’ll keep running at all.”’
Rockets Slip By Polo, W&L En

by G. Bruce Potter

Washington & Lee’s best-ever
water polo season had ended
barely 24 hours previously but
head coach Page Remillard
was already looking ahead nine
months to the start of next
year’s season.

‘“‘We’ve been bombarded with
letters from qualified ap-
plicants all over the country,”’
he said, adding that all he’d
done that day was work on
recruiting.

The Generals will only lose
one player, Mike Bernot, from
this year’s squad that improved
their record to 31-5 with a fifth
place finish in the Eastern In-
tercollegiate Championships
last weekend.

Slippery Rock State College
(Pa.) handed the Generals an
18-14 defeat in the first-round of
the eight-team event. However,
W&L, which was the fifth seed,
rebounded to sink Richmond,
10-4, and Harvard, 11-8.

Cagers Rebuild

by G. Bruce Potter

Senior co-captains Ken Jaffe
and George Spears will lead the
Washington & Lee basketball
team as they open what head
Coach Verne Canfield calls a
“transition year’ on Saturday
against UNC-Greensboro in the
Warner Center at 2:00 p.m.

Although Spears broke two
fingers early last week, he is ex-
pected to see at least spot duty
and perhaps even start, accor-
ding to Canfield. ‘‘It just
depends on how he responds in
practice this week,”’ he said.

The Generals lost four let-
termen from last year’s 16-10
squad, and 12 of the 18 team
members are freshmen or

season and freshmen Jackson
MacFarlane and Scott Shannon
will see action at the center and
forward spots, respectively, ac-
cording to Canfield. The 18th-
year coach also added that one
of the major keys to the club’s
success this year will be to
develop depth.

Because it is such a young
team, said Canfield, ‘‘We will
take the time to teach good ball
control and fundamentals.’’ The
Generals will be installing a
multiple offense for the first
time this year. This new offense
will center on ball control, a

third quarters, but the opposite
would be true on this day as the
Rockets erupted for six goals to
take a 15-10 lead by the time the
quarter had ended.

“We got a little tired but still
tried to play at a fast pace,”’ ex-
plained Remillard. Junior Erik
Peterson led the Generals with
five goals for the game and
classmate Ken Johnstone chip-
ped in with three. However,
goalie Andy Gates only stopped
38 percent of the shots fired at
him.

“It was our best game of the
season,” is how Remillard
described the victory for fifth
place over Harvard. Prior to
the tournament, there had been
some controversy over the
seedings as Harvard, seeded
sixth, thought they should be
above W&L.

“There is no love lost between
the two teams,’’ “explained
Remillard. “It was excellent
water polo, and we played very
good team defense.”’

The game was close the whole
way, and Washington & Lee was

up 7-5 at the half. However,
Peterson, Johnstone and Rand
McClain each had two fouls at
that point (A player is kicked
out of the game for good if he
gets three fouls). Remillard

replaced Peterson with soph-
omore Keith Kadesky, who
gave the team a “tremendous
boost”’ by scoring ih his first 18
seconds of action. ‘‘When we
needed it, he (Kadesky) did it,”’
said Remillard. “Our bench
was extremely critical.”
Peterson shot 71 percent to

ds At 31-5

lead W&L with five goals, and
co-captain Tim Rock, shooting
100 percent, added two.

Against the University of
Richmond, Washington & Lee
controlled the pace better than
they had against Slippery Rock,
and the outcome was never in
doubt, according to Remillard.
In an impressive display of
balanced scoring, seven
Generals accounted for the ten
goals, led by Peterson,
Johnstone, and Bob Marshall
with two apiece.

Peterson’s twelve goals for
the three games upped his
single-season school record to
152, and Bernot closed out his
career with five goals to finish
the year with a personal high of
82, good for second place on the
squad. Johnstone finished the
tourney with seven goals and
Rock added five. In addition,
McClain and Peterson led the
team in assists with eight and
seven, respectively.

Gates stopped exactly 50 per-
cent of the opponents’ shots,
and the Generals converted on

power inside game, and shot
selection. Another key. will be
“how well our experienced
players adapt to the new offen-
sive system,” according td Can-
field. “The guys are adapting to
this very well. We’re right on
our time schedule.”

W&L has always employed a
multiple defense, and ‘‘we’ve
won championships because of
our defensive ability,’’ com-
mented Canfield.

The goal this year is for ‘‘the
team to play up to its fullest
potential and make an effort to
win,’’ explained Canfield. ‘‘The
kids may not play flawlessly,
but they will give an all-out ef-
fort every game.”’

The Old Dominion Athletic
Conference made a rule change
a few weeks ago eliminating the
jump ball except to start an
overtime period. Canfield was
the only coach voting against
this change. However, he ad-
mitted that it places an em-
phasis on defense: “A team can
create a jump ball situation by
playing good defense and get a
few ‘more possessions per
game.”’

Although the coaches voted
Hampden-Sydney College as
the pre-season ODAC favorite,
Canfield said that the ODAC
champion ‘‘must contend

 

against us.”” He described this
year as one of the strongest
ever for the’ conference.
“Everyone in the conference is
loaded with talent,’ he said.
‘We'll be ini the thick of the con-
ference race.”’

The Generals’ schedule this

year was described by Canfield
as “extremely tough.’’ Two of
their first five opponents, UNC-
Greensboro and Allegheny,
made the NCAA regionals last
year and their third game of the
year is on the road against
Hampden-Sydney on Dec. 1.

After opening at home on
Saturday, the squad will take to
the road to face Averett on Nov.
24 and Hampden-Sydney before
returning home against Shenan-
doah on Dec. 3 and Allegheny on
Dec. 9 They will then have
almost a month off for exams
and Christmas break before
getting into the heart of their
schedule.

Frank Eppes, starting center,
said that the ‘‘spirit of the team,

Restaurant

whether or not we really want to
win’’ will be a key along with

good rcbounding and good
defense. :

‘We're learning every day,’’
he said. ‘“‘We probably won’t be
pretty at the start of the season,
but by the end we'll be com-
petitive with anyone in the
ODAC.”

Canfield expressed the same
feelings, saying, ‘‘We’re still in-
experienced but will get
stronger as the season pro-
gresses.”’

Each season, Canfield, the se-
cond winningest basketball
coach in Virginia, comes up
with three letters as the team’s
motto for that year. This
season, those letters are P-F-D,
standing for positive, firm, and
demanding. The coaches are
being firm and demanding in
ensuring that everyone learns
and does so correctly, and the
players should be thinking
positive, according to Canfield.
He went on to explain that this
is essentially the first year of a
two or three year era at W&L.

Film Notes

 

Notorious (1946) A sublime romantic thriller from Alfred Hitch-
cock, starring Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. In the fast-paced
postwar scenario, Bergman is used by the government to spy on an
ex-Nazi leader up to no good in South America. In doing so, she
must marry him, putting her life and body on the line. Probably
Bergman’s sexiest role, with Grant in fine form as the American
agent and supporting roles filled expertly by Claude Rains and
Louis Calhern. Elegant black-and-white photography lends visual
distinction to a series of vintage Hitchcock heart-stoppers, in-
cluding a lot of suspense revolving around a certain key. The
backdrop for most of this highly-charged stuff is down in Rio.

Rogers Publishes
Buddhist Article

Minor Rogers, associate pro-
fessor of religion at Washington
& Lee University, has published
an article in a Japanese journal
devoted to the study of Shin
Buddhist theology.

Rogers’ article is based on
material originally presented in
English at the 25th Interna-
tional Conference of Orien-
talists in May 1980 in Kyoto,
Japan, and in Japanese to the
Shin Buddhist Studies Depart-

ment of Ryukoku University in
June 1980.

The title of the article is
‘“Shinjin and Anjin: A study of
‘Faith’ in Shin Buddhist
History.”’ It was published in
the February 1981 issue of the
journal, a_ publication of
Ryukoku University in Kyoto.

Rogers is_ director of
Washington & Lee’s East Asian
Studies Program.

Law Students Bringing Justice To Grade Schools

by B. Scott Tilley

Several members of the
Washington & Lee law fraterni-
ty, Phi Alpha Delta, are involv-
ed in a program to teach
various aspects of law to
students at six Rockbridge
County secondary and middle
schools.

The purpose of the program
according to second year law
Student, David ‘‘Freedi’’
Friedfeld, is ‘‘to help students
develop a skill in deciding what
is right and wrong under the
law, which will foster respon-
sibility and citizenship.”

The ‘Juvenile Justice Pro-

gram’’ at Washington & Lee is
only a small part of the national
program sponsored by the na-
tional chapter of Phi Alpha
Delta. The national chapter was
one of six organizations to
receive federal funding from
Congress for this project.

“They received half a million
dollars,” said Friedfeld, but
emphasized that ‘‘the money is
used for research and other
things by the national organiza-
tion. None is fed down to us.”’

The project involves going in-
to the classrooms and teaching
the students topics ranging
from the Bill of Rights to Cor-

rectional Institutions.
“Presentations can include
question and answer periods,

mock trials, films, or just
straight lectures,’ said
Friedfeld. Topics may be

presented in a one day presen-
tation, or can run in a series up
tosix days.

Friedfeld noted that ‘“‘mucho”’
work was involved with the pro-
gram. ‘‘We started last June.
We had to call the principals,
set the subjects up with
teachers in conferences, and
prepare the presentation, in ad-
dition to just presenting it.’’ He
emphasized that this is a lot

Tribal Customs In Big Lex?

by Tom Baker

Just as anthropologists are
beginning to show concern over
the disappearance of in-
digenous tribes in the Amazon
jungle, a group of W&L
sophomores is trying to recap-
ture some ancient tribal
customs through the use of
blowguns.

Although it has been used by
tribes indigenous to the Amazon
basin for hundreds of years,
Barry Waterman and Russ
Rosler are convinced that the
blowgun is “‘the weapon of the
future.” According to Water-
man, the blowgun is ‘“‘silent, ac-
curate, effective, sophisticated
and lethal.”’ Its ammunition is
reusable and the blowgun is
legal in all states except in
California and requires no
license.

Rosler pointed out that the
use of the blowgun is a cost-
cutting move as he can hunt
squirrels and other small game
and lessen his dependence on

store-bought food.
Although they have had no
prior experience with

blowguns, Rosler and Water-
man are so enthusiastic about
the weapon that they are think-
ing about starting a blowgun
club at W&L. Waterman adds

Baxter Award Given

A team of third-year students
in Washington & Lee Univer-
sity’s School of Law won a ma-

if Liz’ll be here’). There was no
need to speculate, however,
as neither senator was ever
spotted.

Guests sipped bubbly and
perspired as they writhed in the
mob below the famous cut-glass
chandeliers; It was difficult to
imagine the Watergate and
Army-McCarthy hearings being
held there, though, due to the
chattering throng and a brass
band cranking out innocuous
tunes. For those able to squeeze
through layers of bodies there
was a table spread with cheese
and crackers, fruit, egg rolls,
cubed pork, miniature quiches
and water chestnuts wrapped in
bacon. The huge carved thrones
at either end of the room were
used by the help as shelves for
food boxes and dripping con-
tainers of ice.

. The next morning following a
continental breakfast of
sweetrolls and coffee, the con-
vention was officially opened by
SPJ president Howard Graves.
A roll call of delegates was
thankfully interrupted by an
8:30 appearance by Washington
Post chairman Katharine
Graham.

Mrs. Graham is not a very
charismatic speaker, but her
support of the Freedom of Infor-
mation Act (FOIA, currently
subject to proposed changes by
the Reagan administration)
was loud and clear. She was
rather plain and business-like in
a bright red blouse and gray
skirt, and she wore glasses as
she spoke. After her talk, I spot-
ted her in a side room, gestur-
ing vigorously with both hands
as a circle of pinstripe-suited
men with black briefcases hung

on her every word. Small
wonder she’s just been voted
one of the most influential
women in the country.

After this, the program pro-
mised nothing but a boring mor-
ning of by-law discussion, and
not being a delegate I bid
retreat to our fourth-floor room
overlooking exhaust chimneys
and a bleak construction “'‘e.
Other non-delegates . the
Regency Ballroom as well, and
when CBS reporter Lesley Stahl
gave the keynote address, not
many budding journalists were
there to hear it.

Fortunately, as I left the hotel
at about 9:45, I was privileged
to ride the escalator from the
lobby to the main entrance next
to Stahl herself, the heart throb
of the White House press corps.
Engaging her in conversation —
we talked about her contract
renewal the previous day and
some of her work — I found her
to be a charming and even
dazzling escalator companion.
She was whisked off in a waiting
taxi and I proceeded for a first-
ever tour of the White House.
There, I could have sworn I saw
Nancy Reagan washing an
upstairs window, but the guard
said he didn’t think so. The
mansion was impressive,
serenely elegant, belying the
turmoil ensuing over in the ex-
ecutive offices with the
Stockman affair.

Back at the Hyatt, lunch was -

served at 12:30 in the ballroom,
which features chandeliers
shaped like upside-down jello
molds. Columnist Carl] Rowan

Remillard said he couldn’t
think of any specific turning
point of the season, any point
where he realized the team was
as good or better than he had
anticipated because he never
felt the squad performed as well
as he had expected. However,
he felt that last weekend’s event
may prove a turning point for
next year as the club showed
they could outswim anybody,
even in an all-deep pool.

Next season, said the third-
year coach, up to six people
could step into the fast swimm-
ing Bernot’s shoes and the team
would lose very little. The
Generals’ 31 wins this season
was the most by any water polo
squad on the East Coast and set
the school record for most wins
in a season by any team in any
sport. Their fifth-place finish
was their best showing at the
Easterns, also.

“‘T am elated over the results
of our season,” said Remillard.
“But we think we can do better
next year.”

“T would rather be lucky than
good,’’ said Remillard. ‘‘This
year, we were good but we
weren’t lucky. Next year we
will try to be both good and
lucky.”’

tongue as she served up
thimble-fulls of carrot soup and
plates of salad which turned out
to be the main course. Rowan,
who fulminated for nearly 45
minutes on the dastardly deeds
of the Reagan administration,
was not without humor. Once,
he said, he received a letter
from a woman who said ‘‘Dear
Mr. Rowan: Life for you must
be a terrible burden considering
you’re black and stupid at the
same time.” Carl’s_ reply:
“Dear Ma’m: You are for-
tunate that life isn’t as big a
burden for you. Obviously you
only have half my problems.”

That afternoon after I
discovered a seminar on ethics
was too crowded to attend I
walked over to the Dirksen
building to sit in on Senate sub-
committee hearings on FOIA.
Sen. Orrin Hatch presided and
testimony was provided by
F.B.I. Director William
Webster.

At about 3 p.m. rumors began
spreading like wildfire that
David Stockman would resign
at a 4:30 news conference that
afternoon. Over in the Senate,
my next stop, I observed an ex-
change between Sen. Edward
Kennedy and an aide, who was
reading a xeroxed copy of the
Stockman admissions in the
current Atlantic Monthly. ‘I’m
just reading his garbage,”’ said
the smiling aide. ‘‘What do you,
uh, think he’ll say this after-
noon?’’ asked Kennedy.
“Probably ‘I support this great
government of ours and I’d like
to announce my candidacy for
the governor of Michigan,’ ”’
said the aide.

Ted didn’t mention it, but I
later read that he’d just come
from the White House where he
and mother Rose had met
privately with President and
Mrs. Reagan. He looked ruddy
and trimmer than he’s ap-
peared in a while.

There was a dance and party
at the National Press Club that
night with a band called The
Gents, who. played everything
from current Stones to Chic (La
Freak). Wine and beer flowed
prodigiously and dance floor
stints were alternated with
walks around the press club,
full of autographed pictures and
other items of interest. This
gathering broke up sometime
after 1 a.m.

I slept late the next morning,
choosing not to attend a session
which promised to induce tears
of real boredom anyway. I even
skipped a panel spoof called
‘Meet the Oppressed’ where
politicians and reporters swit-
ched roles and asked each other
ridiculous questions. Apparent-
ly most of the jokes centered
around Albert Hunt’s hair.

Actually, I had good reason to
skip the morning entertainment
as Washington and Lee’s own
Clark Mollenhoff was testifying
as an expert witness on ex-
ecutive privilege before a
House subcommittee. Even
though Peacock had given me
the wrong room number in the
Rayburn building, I found the
chamber in time to catch the
Boomer’s opening statement.
Digressing a few times from his
prepared text, Mollenhoff de-

nounced the use of the ‘‘per-
nicious doctrine”’ since the time _
of the Eisenhower administra-

After Clark and former sub-
committee chairman John
Moss began answering ques-
tions we left the hearing and
proceeded by congressional
subway to the Capitol, where I
went to the Senate in time to
catch some oratory by Jesse
Helms before a vote that would —
reduce funding for the Legal
Services Administration.
Senators began trickling to vote
and tete-a-tetes commenced:
Jackson and Warner, Weiker
and Kennedy, Laxalt and
Baker. The proposal, by
Alabama’s Jerimiah Denton,
was soundly defeated.

After another green lunch, I
skipped the speech, later being
assured I was wise to do so, and
took in the splendid Hyatt sur-
roundings before settling down
to read the paper. I made it
back down to catch a panel
discussion on _ investigative
reporting led by Clark
Mollenhoff (busy day for Uncle
Buckles). To any J-101, 102 or
323 student, the assembled
panel was a dream (or a
nightmare, depending on how
you look at it) come true as
reporters covered in lectures
and tests came to life: Pam
Zeckman and Bob Greene.

It was fun, it could have been
more so, it could have been
worse, but it really was infor-
mative. But aside from awful
food and an assigned roomate
from California who insisted on
locking himself in the bathroom
at regular intervals, it was an
enjoyable expreience.

Thefts During Vacation

by Tom Baker

Thousands of dollars worth of

usually a problem with every

According to Chief Kirby of

tween 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday,
Nov. 25 and 10:00 a.m. on Thurs-
day, Nov. 26. Apparently the
door to each unit burgalarized

had been kicked in. Items that

were taken included stereo
equipment, watches, money,
and clothes. Kirby added that
the value of the amount stolen
from all the students will be in
the thousands of dollars.

Twenty-nine Washington and

break. According to Kirby, the
front door had been left open
and every room in the house
had been entered.

University Proctor Charles
Murray added that the people
who committed these burglar-
ies were probably older and
more experienced than the
youngsters that usually break
into the fraternity houses and
apartments at W&L.

Chief Kirby said that as the
police begin their investigation
into the crimes, they will try to
compile a complete list of
everything that was stolen. In
this way, the police will

recognize any of the stolen-

items if someone were to try to
sell them. Kirby also explained
that this is all a long process
that can take months to com-
plete before anyone is charged
with the crime.

  

by Patrick Jordan

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity is seeking $40,000 in
damages from two Longwood
College students in connection
with their role in the destruction
of several university owned
shrubs two years ago.

The suit filed in the
Rockbridge County Circuit
Court Tuesday alleges that
Lawrence J. Meyer of Farm-
ville and Kevin Newton of
Virginia Beach were among
several Washington and Lee
students who damaged 37
English boxwood shrubs and
one American boxwood plant
between Tucker Hall and
Tucker Annex on Dec. 6, 1979.

Eric Lee Sisler, representing
Washington and Lee in the case,
said several of the plants were
damaged too severely that they
would not survive while others

would require costly care-and
rehabilitation.

Sisler said the university will
have to pay a substantial sum of
money to repair the damaged
Shrubs as well as buy new
shrubs to replace the dead
plants.

The incident occurred after
several Washington and Lee
students and others decided to:
run through the shrubs while
celebrating a one point varsity
basketball victory over
Hampden-Sydney College.

As a result of the incident,
four members of the Washing-
ton and Lee basketball team, in-
cluding the squad’s leading
scorer and captain were
suspended from the team for
one year.

In addition, the Student Con-
trol Committee put all 10
Washington and Lee students

For Damages In Boxwood Case.

involved on social and conduct
probation for one year and the
students had to do eight hours of
volunteer community work per
week.

Sisler said none of the
Washington and Lee students
were mentioned in the suit
because ‘“‘they had already
assumed their financial obliga-
tions concerning the plants.”’

Sisler said both Meyer and
Newton have until Dec. 8 to re-
ply to the suit and that if they do
not answer the motion, the
court will automatically rule
that they pay the university
$40,000.

The English boxwoods were
among 210 plants donated to the
university by Wilmer S.
Poyner, a former New York
Life Insurance Co. agent. His
son, Dr. John Poyner, grad-
uated from W&L in 1962.

Udall would speak Monday,
Dec. 7.

President Eric Myers asked
Drinkwater who Udall was.

‘Udall was Secretary of the
Interior under Kennedy and
Johnson.”

“Oh, of course. How blind of
me,’’ Myers joked.

Secretary Bennett Ross later
asked when letters had been
mailed out to parents asking for
contributions. Ross said that his
parents did not receive a letter
until the week of Thanksgiving.

Co-Chairman Robert McLean
said the letters went out on Nov.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Contact’s Lineup

F. Lee Bailey, the nation’s most famous — or in-
‘amous —barrister, will speak Feb. 4, at a cost of
$5900.

Arthur Miller, author of ‘‘Death of a Salesman’’ and
‘The Crucible,’’ will speak here Jan. 26, at a cost of
32750.

A lot of people are complaining that Contact has
failed us so far this year. The first speaker has yet to
be heard. However, the improvement over last year
(when people only thought or
wished that the fall speakers had not started) is a
great improvement indeed.

Compare Miller and Bailey to last year’s top-
hitters, G. Gordon Liddy and Frank Abagnale. This
year we get to show the faculty our taste and in-
telligence.

What problems that have arisen have stemmed
from the shifting responsibility for financing Contact.
The Inter-Fraternity Council started Contact for the
intellectual betterment of the campus, but after
several years has begun to share the responsibility
with the Executive Committee. It is only fair that
each new IFC spend its money as it wishes. This tran-
sition, however, led to confusion, which made all
those concerned look bad.

At first glance, Contact looks bad, only. who is to
blame? Even though letters asking parents for money
did not arrive until Thanksgiving, and even though
the committee’s own members have not been includ-
ed in the entire process, the schedule of speakers is
good.

Charged by the E.C. to redeem the speaker pro-
gram at Washington and Lee, Co-Chairmen Mike
Drinkwater and Robert McLean have bought us some
gems. There is not yet a solid tradition that could con-
tinue itself with its own momentum, nor is there a
reliable source of stimulating oratory, nor is there a
solution to the financial problem. However, there is

hope.
"The Time Story

fhe debate on the merits of coeducation has been
vather mute on this campus this year. Only when
nationally-read Time Magazine discussed all-male
colleges did the subject reawaken. What alarms us is
not that some students oppose coeducation or some
faculty members favor it, but that Washington and
Lee, a university which strives for uniqueness, allow-
ed itself to be amalgamated into a group that included
neck-straining rats and tatooed professors.

One gets an impression from the Time article that
our undergraduate campus (the law school is coed,
mind you) consists of gentlemen (a) opposed to
females searching for higher education in Lexington
and (b) opposed to the recognition of the ‘‘liberated”’
female. Should we assume from the Time article that
Washington and Lee graduates fear the enlightened
female? Do we really think that women are good at
only one profession? These are questions that we
should seriously ponder.

This university’s single gender is a fact of life that
is too multi-faceted to either praise or condemn.
However it is frightening to believe that a student
body of a modern college thinks of females only as
weekend playthings. Does the entire student body
deserve to come across to the nation as a bunch of
minks who like their women out of classes, in skirts
and only in weekend doses? Time apparently conclud-
ed that this would be a fair appraisal of Washington
and Lee.

Some Ideas From Rock Delta Rock

Dear Sir:

I just want to say a few
things:

1. The Time Magazine article
stunk! Of course the ‘‘guys’”’
here are a lot closer, that’s all
girls to wear skirts at all times,
I assume you wear a coat and
I assume you wear a coat and
tie! Hooray for Professor
Hodges. I’m _ glad someone
understands what society and
education are all about today.

2. Where the hell is Contact?
Have they disbanded? They
might as well for all the good
they are doing. I mean this
place is stagnant enough when

Somebody

Dear Sir:

As a parent of a junior at
W&L, I would like to congrat-
ulate you and your staff on your
paper, the Ring-tum Phi.

I look forward to its arrival
with great pleasure, its
editorials and articles.

As a lawyer’s wife of thirty-
eight years, I have been expos-
ed to law students, all sizes

shapes.
John Blossom IV’s letter so
angered me with its immature,

arrogant, self-righteous and
supercilious attitude, I felt it
necessary to write you.

Please continue to be as you
are. You are doing a fine job!

As for Mr. Amsler, continue
to advertise Trojans. It’s
healthy.

it comes to providing for ‘‘men-
tal growth” other than academ-

isn’t going to be an exception. If
this place is supposed to be ‘‘one

(a quote from our friendly
alumni and friends), then let’s
get on the stick and get going. 1

this place with an iron hand and
that I never expect to see girls

time, but I have to admit that I

Contact Gets Unenthusiastic Approval From EC

(continued from page 1)

Myers asked if the society
had made progress in finding
projectionists that did not
charge, as was discussed at the
original budget hearings in
September.

“We kind of like the fact thar
the law school runs the films,”’
Clarke said. Law student pro-
jectionists charge over ten
dollars a film.

“At two of the films the pro-
jector broke down and we don’t
want to get blamed for breaking
law school projectors,” said
Clarke.
though he was a member of the
committee.

Smith recommended _ that
posters be put up to announce
meetings.

Myers thanked Drinkwater
and McLean, and said the
schedule was good, especially
F. Lee Bailey, who will appear

Feb. 4.

John Martin, co-chaiman of
the Student Activities Board,
told the E.C. that he was trying
to work out a way to get adver-
tising in the school newspaper
at a lower rate.

He reported that at other area
colleges, the student activities
organizations are given free
advertising in the papers.

Martin complained that the

- combined price of several full-

page ads is higher than the

_ price of a band.

Myers added, ‘Advertising

_ has always been a problem with

the SAB, and if they don’t do a
good job publicizing, an event
can flop.”

Ross, Ben Hale, ’84 Rep., and
John Vlahoplus, ’83 Rep., all
noted that it was not the
business of the E.C. to set the
policy of the Ring-tum Phi.

Colloquium Debates Use

Of

The use of opinion testimony
in federal trials was the topic of
a colloquium held Monday in
the Frances Lewis Law Center
of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s School of Law.

US. District Judge George
Pratt of the Eastern District of
New York State delivered a
paper on the topic and then led a
discussion.

Pratt, the presiding judge in
all the ABSCAM trials, and the
participants examined the con-
ditions under which opinion
testimony is admissible and the
appropriate procedures for
qualifying an expert witness
under the federal rules of

Opinion Testimony

evidence.

The colloquium was attended
by members of the W&L law
school faculty and W&L law
students. In addition, three
visiting experts in the field were
in attendance — Judge James
C. Turk of Roanoke, Frederick
Lederer of the William and
Mary law _ school, and
Christopher B. Mueller of the
University of Wyoming law
school.

Frederic L. Kirgis Jr., pro-
fessor of law at W&L, is the
director of the Lewis Law
Center which sponsors collo-
quiums and conferences on a
variety of topics throughout the
year.

“John, I'd have to disagree
with you to some extent,” said
Myers. “‘The Phi gets money
from student body funds and we
do have a responsibility to do
something with this.”’

Myers recommended finally
that the SAB and the Ring-tum
Phi work it out between
themselves.

Cutting Clubs’ Funds

Tripp Brower, ’82 — Rep.,
moved that clubs which do not
report to the E.C. as requested
have their funds cut off at the
business office, temporarily,
until they do appear before the
E.C.

The Outing Club missed its se-
cond scheduled appearance,
prompting this measure. The
motion was passed unanimous-
ly. ;

If a club representative does
not show up as scheduled, the
E.C. will freeze the account.
Vouchers cannot be written to
take money out of the account
until the E.C.
treasurer to open the account.

Sub-Committee Reports
Russell Clarke, chairman of
the Film Society, announced
that the third film of the term,
“The Magic Flute” by Ingmar
Bergman, will be shown this

instructs the

weekend.

When the Student Bar Asso-
ciation’s treasurer reported,
Griffith asked if she would look
into finding volunteers to run
the projectors for the Film
Society, which uses the
facilities in Lewis Hall because
it holds more students and is
more comfortable.

The International Club’s
treasurer Emory Edwards
reported that they had helped
sponsor an International Day
Hollins. A trip to Washington,
D.C., was also planned.

The Fencing and Rugby clubs
also reported.

Museum Trustees Meet In Lexington

The 35-member board of
trustees of the Virginia
Museum met in _ Lexington
Thursday (Nov. 19).

According to officials of the
Richmond-based museum, the
meeting marked the first time
in memory that the board had
held a meeting away from Rich-
mond.

The Lexington meeting coin-
cided with the museum’s
special loan exhibition which
opened in Washington and Lee
University’s duPont Gallery on
Tuesday.

The exhibition, ‘Oriental
Splendor: Japanese and
Chinese Decorative Arts,” is
being co-sponsored by Wash-
ington and Lee and the
Rockbridge Chapter of the
Virginia Museum.

The museum’s board of
trustees, comprised of
members from throughout
Virginia, were guests at a
reception in duPont Gallery and

Rule Committee To Convene

The Committee on _ the
Automatic Rule will meet at
10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Dec.
23, 1981 to consider the
academic records of those

students who have fallen under’

the Automatic Rule:

1. Students who failed to meet
the conditions of Academic Pro-
bation required of them at the
end of the current Fall Term;

2. Students completing a full
academic year who failed to
meet the cumulative average
required of their class.

The Committee will consider
for immediate reinstatement
all students who fall under the
Automatic Rule. If any student
wishes to inform the Committee
of extenuating circumstances,
he may write a letter to the
Committee and deliver it to the
Office of the Dean of the College
before the Committee meets.

In general, the Committee
grants few immediate rein-
statements. A student who falls
under the Automatic Rule has
severed his connection with the
University. If the Committee
does not grant him immediate
reinstatement, he is not eligible

for reinstatement until after the
passage of at least one calendar
year.

As soon as possible after the
Committee’s meeting, each stu-
dent falling under the Auto-
matic Rule will receive a letter
explaining his status.

ACADEMIC PROBATION

Any student not subject to the

Automatic Rule in December

who fails to achieve the
cumulative average required of
him at the end of Fall Term,
1981 (see page 61 in Catalogue),
places himself on Academic
Probation for Winter Term,
1982.

Tyler Guest Lecturer At
Judge Advocate School

Richard B. Tyler, visiting
professor of law at Washington
and Lee University, was a
featured lecturer at the Judge
Advocate General School in
Charlottesville, Va., last month.

Tyler, who is visiting the
W&L School of Law during the
1981-82 academic year while on
leave from the University of
Missouri, examined legal inter-
viewing techniques in his lec-
ture to the legal assistance of-
ficer class.

The audience consisted of 58
military lawyers drawn from
all branches of the service. The
legal assistance officers pro-
vide civil legal assistance to
military personnel and depend-

ents at the major bases both
within the continental United
States and overseas. The legal
assistance officer course is a
one-week refresher on the types
of civil law most frequently en-
countered in such practice for
personnel who have been detail-
ed to such assignments.

Tyler, who has taught at the
University of Missouri Law
School since 1972, is teaching a
course in legal interviewing and
counseling for law students, as
well as corporate law, at W&L.
The course is similar to one
which he has offered for several
years at the University of
Missouri.

Cagers Lose Three

by G.Bruce Potter
Hampden-Sydney College -

handed the Washington and Lee -
their third:

basketball team
defeat in as many outings 55-54
Tuesday night. The three
Generals’ losses, the other two
coming over Thanksgiving
break to UNC-Greensboro 60-58,
and Averett, 49-48, have been by
a total of four points.

How does Head coach Verne
Canfield feel about these set-
backs for his young squad?
“T’m disappointed but not
discouraged in any way,’’ he
said. ‘‘We’ll just have to pa-
tiently keep working on what we
need to work on.”’

The Generals jumped out to a
28-18 lead at the half against H-
SC, and maintained it through-
out the early stages of the se-
cond half. However, with 11:09
remaining, the Tigers rallied
from a 42-31 deficit with a 144
spurt. W&L boosted their lead
to five at 54-49 with 3:09 left, on-
ly to have the Tigers score the
game’s final six points, the win-
ning ticket coming with only
nine seconds on the clock.

Senior George Spears and
sophomore John Graves
paced W&L with 15 and 14

points, respectively. Graves
also pulled down eight rebounds
to lead the squad.

The script was almost exactly
the same for the Generals’
other two losses. Against UNC-
Greensboro, the team was up by
counts of 23-14, 27-18 in the first
half, and, with 10:05 left, led
46-38. However, a little over two
minutes later, the

Generals found themselves
down 48-47, only to come back to
snatch a 56-52 lead with 4:05 re-
maining.

UNC-Greensboro rebounded
for six straight points to take a
58-56 lead with 1:28 on the clock,
but junior Brian Hanson, who
finished with 14 points, sank a
layup to Knot the score. The
Spartans then called a time out
and managed to get off four
shots, until the ball was finally
tapped home as time ran out for
their victory.

Washington and Lee held a
42-36 lead over Averett midway
through the second half, but a
Cougar 13-2 run gave them a
49-44 lead with 1:48 remaining.
Graves, the Generals leading
scorer with 16 points, quickly
sank a basket and two free
throws as W&L pulled within
one with 1:09 left. Ken Jaffe had
a good chance to give the
Generals the lead with three
seconds showing on the clock
but his layup was not good, and
he was called for charging.
Although Averett could not sink
the ensuing free throw, W&L
was unable to get off another
shot before time ran out.

Canfield explained that the
team made a lot of mental
mistakes against Averett and
“deserved to lose.’’ However,
he also felt that the squad
played ‘well enough to win”
against UNC-Greensboro.

Some of the problems were
the team’s forcing the ball, not
making shots, committing turn-
overs (20 against Averett), and

failing to read defenses correct-

ly. In addition, ‘‘the bench is not
contributing as well as we need
it to”’ he said.

After three games, Graves
leads the team with 15.0 points
per game while Spears is
averaging ten points a contest.
Graves is also the rebounding
‘leader at 7.0, followed by junior
Frank Eppes at 6.3. In addition,

Debut

After a less than fruitful
season of a year ago, one mar-
red by injuries and frustration,
the Washington and Lee wrestl-

Of the ten weight classes, seven
will be occupied by freshmen,
and while experience looms
large against the Generals,
head coach Gary Franke is
looking forward to a promising
year. Those freshmen include
Tom Alleva, Ron Thornton,
Gordon Ogden, David Harrar,
Jeff Dixon, Greg Kendrick, and
Joe O'Neil.
Mark Weaver are also vying for
varsity spots. 158 pound
sophomore Tim Valliere along
with 118 pound senior Elbert
Umila and heavy weight
Carlton Peebles provide the
focal point of the line-up.
Against this backbone, the team
is sure to be a tough competitor.

The Generals have been prac-
ticing for the season since mid
October and were able to test
their ability in November 14th’s
Takedown Tournament at
Madison University. Competing

- with several other surrounding

college teams on an informal
level, W&L wrestlers were
reasonably well prepared and
conditioned for the bout.
Freshmen Tom Alleva at the
126 pound weight class and 167
pound Jeff Dixon particularly
highlighted the day scoring
third and second place finishes,

. respectively.

Lead ’82 Baseball Team

joined the University in the fall
of 1980. This past spring he was
an assistant baseball coach as
the Generals compiled a 10-14
record, the most wins in ten
seasons. Bowers, in his first
year at W&L, is also an assis-
tant_ coach for the football
squad.

Pressler Among All-Americans

ROCHESTER, N.Y. — Mike
Pressler, a four-year defensive
line standout for Washington &
Lee University, was named
Tuesday the Kodak All-
America football team for the
college division II class.

A 5-11, 205-lb. resident of
Wilton, Conn., Pressler started
-at nose guard every game dur-
ing his four-year career and led
the Generals in tackles as a
sophomore and senior. He
received first-team  All-Con-
ference honors from the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference

(ODAC) as a junior and senior,
second-team recognition as a
sophomore.

This past season he collected
65 solo tackles, 20 assists, and
four fumble recoveries to lead a
W&L defense ranked first in the
conference by allowing 226.3
yards per game. He also served
as a team tri-captain to help the
Generals post an 8-2 record,
their best mark since 1962, and
win their first conference
crown.

Pressler becomes the’ second
W&L player to receive the

Kodak award, the first being
wide receiver Tony Perry of
Waynesboro, Va. in 1976. In ad-
dition to his football perfor-
mances Pressler is a three-year
letterman and starter on attack
for the W&L lacrosse team.

The Kodak All-America team
is selected by the American
Football Coaches’ Association.
The 22-member college division
II squad represents the nation’s
best from the NCAA Division III
and NAIA Division II colleges
and universities.

W&L Puts Several On All- ODAC

Washington & Lee Universi-
ty’s football and soccer teams
accounted well for themselves
this past Tuesday, November 17
when the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference presented post-
season awards at its annual fall
meeting held in Staunton, Va.

In football, Generals’ tailback
Chris Cavalline earned the
ODAC Player-of-the-Year
laurel and head coach Gary
Fallon the league’s Coach-of-
the-Year award. Cavalline was
one of eight W&L players
selected to the 24-man All-
Conference first team. Four
Generals received second-team
recognition. ;

In soccer, two W&L standouts
were named to the 11-man All-
Conference first team, one to
the second team.

A junior and three-year let-
terman, Cavalline collected 765
yards and seven touchdowns on
235 carries to finish second in
conference rushing. In addition
he caught 23 passes for 221
yards and punted 36 times for a
35.0-yard average as the
Generals ran up an impressive
8-2 overall record and a 4-1
league mark good for their first
ODAC football title.

He becomes the third General
to win the Player-of-the-Year
football honor, the first being
wide receiver Tony Perry in
1976 and the second linebacker
Car! Folcik in 1978.

Joining Cavalline on the All--

Conference first team were:
sophomore quarterback Al
Paradise, who completed 57.5
percent of his pass attempts for
1014 yards and six touchdowns;
senior tight end Mike Fogarty,
who hauled in a conference-high
31 passes for 418 yards and four
touchdowns; junior offensive
lineman Andy Foley; sopho-
more offensive lineman Glenn
Kirschner; junior place-kicker
Bill Devine, who this past

season entered the W&L record
book in four categories; senior
defensive lineman Mike
Pressler, a four-year starter
who led W&L in tackles and
fumbles recoveries this season,
and junior defensive back
Barry Thompson.

W&L’s four second-team
players were all senior
defensemen: safety Gene
Newton, end Tom Noble,
linebacker John McKee, and
lineman Dave Nickels.

Fallon, who completed his
fourth season at the Generals’
helm, was: the unanimous
choice for conference Coach-of-
the-Year to mark the first time
a W&L director has received

the honor. The owner of a 20-20
mark at the University, Fallon
this past season led W&L to its
best mark since 1962 and to its
first ODAC title.

In soccer, junior Tad Renner
and sophomore Roland Simon
received first-team accolades
for W&L, which finished with a
4-10-1 record this fall. Renner
proved himself a mainstay in
the Generals’ defense while
Simon paced the team in goals
(6) and assists (5). Each player
received or shared four team
Player-of-the-Game honors.

Sophomore Mark Sullivan
received seoond-team All-
Conference soccer recognition.

Entertainment
A Bergman For Christmas

by Carren O. Kaston

In response to popular de-
mand, the W&L Film Society
will show Ingmar Bergman’s
The Magic Flute (Sweden, 1975:
134 minutes) as a special pre-
Christmas treat. This movie
version of Mozart’s opera will
be screened on Friday and
Saturday, December 4 and 5, at
8:00 p.m., and on Sunday,
December 6, at 1:30 p.m., in
classroom ‘‘A’’ of Lewis Hall,
free of charge. The sound
system in the room will be
boosted to accommodate this
movie, in which music is so cen-
tral. Translations of the libretto
appear as subtitles.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
composed both orchestral
music and operas, the best

known of which are The Mar-
riage of Figaro (1786), Don
Giovanni (1787), Cosi fan Tutte
(1790), and The Magic Flute
(1791). The Magic Flute is the
last opera Mozart completed
before his death by poisoning at
the age of thirty-five.

Although the opera began by
taking shape as an Oriental fan-
tasy, a type of entertainment
popular at the time, Mozart and
his librettist, Emanuel
Schikaneder, decieded midway
through the composition to
honor the recent death of a
Masonic leader. Both Mozart
and Schikaneder were Free-
masons, and the opera may be
understood, on one level, as an
allegory describing a quest for
Spiritual emancipation and

—_— Film Notes

Psycho (1960) Some of Alfred Hitchcock’s biggest hits were
lavishly produced thrillers with big stars like Cary Grant and In-
grid Bergman or James Stewart and Grace Kelly. This black and
white classic, frequently resembling a Perry Mason re-run, packs a
bigger wallop and is probably better than anything he ever did. The
direction, editing and photography are superb. The famous shower
scene is a stunner no matter how many times you see it, but it helps
if you go in having no idea. The cast includes Anthony Perkins,
Vera Miles, Martin Balsam and poor Janet Leigh. This weekend in
duPont, courtesy of the SAB, at $1a stab.

The Magic Flute (1978) Bergman’s critically acclaimed little
opera, discussed thoroughly in this issue of the Phi. From the Film
Society.

Toma, Citta Aperta (Open City) (1945) Neorealism by Roberto
Rossellini, using real settings and real people to depict real Nazi
oppression, Italian style. He actually moved the cameras in before
the Germans moved out. A powerful film, unrelenting, with a
magnificent performance by the great Italian actress Anna
Magnani. (Ingrid Bergman junkies may be interested to know that
this picture initially attracted the married film queen to Italian
director Rossellini which resulted in an international scandal in
1949). Shown by the journalism department Tuesday at 7 and 9 p.m.
in Reid 203. Admission is free.

psychology is eased here in the
realm of myth.

Bergman’s monumental
Cries and Whispers (1972) was
the movie with which the Film
Society opened its first season,
in 1978. We chose Bergman as
our first director because in the
late 50’s and early 60's,
Bergman’s example helped to
inaugurate a development in
world cinema whose assump-
tions dominate movie-making
and movie-watching to the pre-
sent day. This development is
called the ‘‘French New Wave.”’

The New Wave _ enabled
movies to achieve recognition
as a major art-form. It en-
couraged audiences to regard
films not, as formerly, as show-
cases for star performers, but
as stages in the growth and
career of a director-artist. This
cornerstone of the New Wave is

called the ‘‘auteur’’ (or
‘‘author’’) theory of filmmak-
ing.

In The Magic Flute, a fairy
Queen of the Night sends Prince
Tamino to rescue her daughter
Pamina from the apparently
evil sorcerer Sarastro. Tamino
is accompanied by a buffoonish,
earthbound sidekick, the bird-
catcher Papageno. To ensure
their safety on the mission,
Tamino carries a magic flute
and Papageno silver bells.

The second act reverses the
character values, or offers a se-
cond view of them. Sarastro

now appears as High Priest of
the Temple of Wisdom, and he
is protecting Pamina from her
demonic mother. Tamino and
Papageno must undergo a
series of trials for initiation into
Sarastro’s mystic brotherhood

-and consummation of their

romantic quest. But even
Papageno, who is ultimately
more humanly fallible than he
is enlightened or mystical, is
rewarded with his Papagena.
The plot turns on the theme of
ideal love and partnering:
Tamino/Pamina, and Papa-
geno/Papagena.

Not-So ‘True Confessions ’

by Todd Jones

True Confessions is Robert
DeNiro’s latest film, in which
he co-stars with Robert Duvall.
In the film, DeNiro plays a very
powerful priest, who through
dealing with contractors, has
been able to build schools for
the church for a cheaper-than-
list price. One man, played by
Charles Durning, has saved the
church 5 million dollars.

Robert Duvall plays DeNiro’s
brother. He is a cop working on
a murder case. Before becom-
ing a policeman, he worked as a
bag-boy for Durning, who was a

Tuesday

Stewart L. Udall, secretary of
the interior for the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations, will
be the featured speaker for the
first program in Washington
and Lee’s Contact series on
Tuesday, Dec. 8, at 8 p.m. in
Lee Chapel.

Contact is a speaker sym-
posium jointly sponsored by the
Interfraternity Council and the
Student Government at W&L.
Udall’s speech is free and open
to the public.

Currently practicing en-
vironmental law in Washington,
D.C., Udall lectures to universi-
ty and: business audiences on
ecology and energy.

Shortly after being elected to
a fourth term as United States
Representative from Arizon’s
second congressional district,
Udall was appointed by Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy to serve
as the 37th secretary of the in-
terior — a cabinet position he
held throughout the administra-
tions of presidents Kennedy and
Lyndon B. Johnson.

As secretary of the interior,
Udall had wide-ranging respon-
sibilities for the nation’s natural
resources. The ideas he _ in-
itiated and the programs he im-
plemented helped bring the eco-
logical revolution to fruition.

Following the change of ad-
ministrations in January 1969,
Udall formed OVERVIEW, an
environmental consulting firm.
In 1970-72, he was co-author of a
syndicated column on _ en-
vironmental issues.

pimp. He is investigating an
especially grisly murder which
he finds Durning might have
been involved in. Meanwhile,
Durning is given the ‘‘Layman
of the Year Award’’ by the
Catholic Church. Duvall
becomes so angry that he
decides to expose Durning as
being involved in the murder of
this girl (who we find out was a
hooker) even though he knows
Durning is innocent. Duvall
finds out, however, that his
brother was also _ involved
somehow with this girl, and that
if Durning is exposed, DeNiro
will be ruined as well.

   
   
   
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
   
  
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
   
   

Despite an interesting plot,
True Confessions is not a very
good movie. It is too slow mov-
ing. There are scenes in the
movie which could have easily
been omitted. The dialogue does
not always fit the characters: at
one point DeNiro starts cursing
while disrobing after giving
communion. Although DeNiro
and Duvall are both excellent
actors, this film did not display
their talents well enough.

True Confessions has an in-
teresting plot, and good
photography, but is just too
slow-moving to be entertaining.

a little more emphasis on the

you’d probably be surprised as
to how much more pleasant
everything and everybody
would be around here. You
missed your chance by giving
Chi Psi the old school house.
What a perfect girls’ dormitory
it would have made. I mean, for
less than it cost to redo the
Tucker annex, you could have
made a really nice dorm out of
it, say for 100-200 girls...and no
doubt they would have thrown
better parties! Well, don’t
worry, cuz you guys can
redeem yourselves — give Chi

have the old school available for

Focus Plans A Monthly Paper

Outing Club Finally Attends Ex. Com. Meeting

by Todd Smith

A monthly 12-page newspaper
is planned for next term to deal
with intellectual topics, Focus
leaders reported to the Ex-
ecutive Committee Monday
night.

Focus, formerly the Intellec-
tual Symposium, will publish
the newspaper to plug its
monthly forums as well as im-
prove the intellectual at-
mosphere on campus, said
Chairman Bill Archer, if the
money can be found.

The E.C. also heard from the
Outing Club, Ariel and Calyx at
the 6:30 meeting.

Focus plans to have the
newspaper ‘‘Excelsior’’

published as is the Ring-tum
Phi, perhaps as a supplement,
and expects the costs to run in
the $600 range.

Archer said he was applying
for ‘‘pilot grants”’ to support the
newspaper. He cited the Morris
foundation and the National En-
dowment for the Humanities as
possible sources.

‘We really want to be a forum
of ideas. That’s why we're try-
ing to do it as non-splashy as
possible and as cheaply as
possible,”’ said Archer.

E.C. president Myers sug-
gested that class papers and
reports be examined for possi-
ble publication.

Jon Pakula, who handles the
group’s publicity, added, ‘‘The
true goal of the Excelsior is not
to restrict it at all, so that every
persons’s class could relate to

Pakula said that the first
issue would deal mainly with
limited nuclear war, which is

crantz and Guildenstern Are Dead” for Washington and Lee

Member Of Class Of °15
Gives $250,000 To W&L |

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has received a gift of
$250,000 from John G. Boat-
wright of Dan’s Hill, Danville,
Va.

Boatwright, a member of
Washington and Lee’s class of
1915, made the gift in memory
of his wife, Mary Archer Glass
Boatwright, and their son, Dr.
Robert McDearmon Boat-
wright, who graduated from

W&L in 1942.

In recognition of the gift, the
rare books reading room in the
University Library will be

named The Boatwright Room.

A plaque recognizing Boat-
wright’s gift will be placed in
that room.

the topic of the first monthly
forum. Later issues would be
less narrow. ‘‘You have to start
somewhere,” said Pakula.

The date of the first Focus
Forum is set at the first Thurs-
day of February, with the Ex-
celsior coming out a week
before that, in January.

Focus reported spending $130
for the stationery it will request
contributions with. Myers said
the work of Focus ‘‘sounds pro-
mising.”’

Tom Stoppard Drops In On Lexington

by John Wells

When British playwright Tom Stoppard arrived
on campus last week, he took in the Southern Vic-
torian spaciousness of Lee House and asked ‘‘Who
else is staying here with me?”’ He was slightly sur-
prised and quite pleased to discover that he alone
would occupy the five-bedroom President’s House
that night.

Anyone apprehensive that Stoppard — probably
as gifted as any current dramatist on either side of
the Atlantic — would be difficult or enigmatic
was pleasantly surprised to discover no trace of
remoteness or eccentricity frequently associated
with one so brilliant. In fact, he was quite charm-
ing and accessible, and his warmth and good
humor shone through frequently in casual conver-
sation. Americans are easily charmed by the
Strains of a British accent, but the depth of Stop-
pard’s personality and intellect is far more im-
pressive than his pleasant speech patterns.

Seated in the small library of Lee House, he
brought to mind earlier physical comparisons by
some to members of the Rolling Stones. In fact, his
face resembles a composite photograph of Jag-
ger/Richards/Wyman, and physically he looks
like Jagger, medium height and lean. He walked
around during the interview, offering opinions and
gesturing with an ever-present filter cigarette.

During the course of the talk it was revealed
that Stoppard, author of more than a dozen plays,
began his career as a newspaper reporter. He pur-
sued this occupation for six years and wrote his
first play in 1960, when, he said, ‘disproportionate
attention’’ was being paid to British theater. He
began reporting without considering any other
future career, and says he misses ‘‘the ambiance,
not the practice’’ of journalism and prefers the
“‘lazier life’ of self-employment. He _ still
subscribes to several different newspapers.

(continued on page 8)

 

It is particularly appropriate
that the rare books reading
room be named The Boatwright
Room. Mrs. Boatwright estab-
lished a special collection in the
library in memory of the Boat-
wright’s son, who died on Nov.
4, 1962. The Boatwright Collec-
tion was established to provide
funds for books of exceptional
beauty which the library would
not otherwise be able to pur-
chase.

The Boatwright Collection
currently numbers more than
275 volumes. The books bear
Dr. Boatwright’s name and rep-
resent a vital portion of the
library’s holdings. Many of the

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Exam Week

Throughout ‘the _next week, all students at
Washington and Lee, have a chance to participate in
something that is both a pleasure and a privilege to be
associated with. W&L’s independent examination
syst@tin gives its students the rare opportunity to
determine their own pace of taking final exams.

Unlike many other universities, W&L offers its
students the chance to take their exams whenever
they please (within a one-week period, of course).
This privilege is something that most seasoned
students overlook and most freshmen cannot com-
prehend. Very few universities allow you to take ex-
ams at your own discretion. It is a credit to our honor
system that students need not be doted over by ad-
ministration officials before and during exams.

Also refreshing is the casual attitude that most pro-
fessors take toward the taking of exams. One pro-
fessor, when questioned by a student as to how late he
could change the date of his exam, said that his
department would leave that up to the responsibility
of the student. We view this not as an attitude of
slackness, but one of trust in the system.

Hopefully, most students will adhere to the regula-
tions of our honor system during the next week. By
obeying the honor system, students at this university
are rewarded with the privilege of taking exams at
their own pace. This is a reward that is far to valuable
to lose. Enjoy the next week.

Merry Christmas From The Phi

 

Rock Delta

Dear Sir:

I would like to respond to last
week’s letter by ‘‘Rock Delta
Rock.’’ However, I find it
hardto believe that that’s
someone’s actual name and
since they didn’t have the in-
testinal fortitude to sign their
name to such a highly critical
letter, I cannot address them
directly. Of course, I also think
it is a bad practice for the Phi to
print a letter without a name.

It is far easier for one to
criticize than to participate and
resolve. With regards to the ex-
change program, I think most
will agree how absurd it is to
consider housing ‘‘100-200
females” in the house the
university turned over to Chi
Psi; unless you want a building
like Sweet Briar’s Hostel and
most girls wouldn’t tolerate
that for a semester or year.
Besides, University Services
does provide some housing to
exchange students in Woods
Creek.

Might I ask if you have been
willing to pick up your belong-
ings and move down the road to
encourage the exchange pro-
gram? The program is recipro-
cating. I can assure you that far
more girls come to W&L than
guys go to their schools. Per-
sonally, I have participated in
classes at both Hollins and
Mary Baldwin.

If you have a problem with
“‘Contact,”’ might I suggest you
talk with one of the co-chairmen
and voice your criticism in a
constructive way instead of
complaining in an uneducated
and general manner. Perhaps
you should apply next spring
and assist the committee. (I’m
assuming you’re not a senior,
you don’t sound ready to
graduate. )

With regards to 30 University

not recognize the opportunity at
your doorstep. Maybe as an
alumnus you will see the
benefits derived from what Jim
Whitehead has put so much

energy into over the last 15
years.

My quote in last week’s Time
was taken out of context by Ms.
Constable but I do not apologize
for it. We have a different situa-
tion here than at most univer-
sities and I still feel it can be en-
joyed and perhaps even bene-
ficial if kept in the proper frame
of mind. I hope W&L will retain
this uniqueness in the years to
come.

While I have a soapbox, on
behalf of the SAB, I’d like to
thank Herring Travel, Le Car-
dinal and Athletic Attic for their
generous support at the Back-
gammon Tournament last
weekend.

Dear Sir:

Your editorial ‘“‘The Time
Story’’ in the December 3 issue
leaves me even less impressed
with the Phi’s brand of alleged
journalism than I was with the
magazine piece in the first
place.

Not that the Time story was
any paragon of reporting skills;
it was their (Sic.) usual glossed-
over bungling of facts, mixed
with slightly less “human in-
terest’’ pap than _ those
charlatans cram into their
sister publication People. But at
least the writer had a coherent
perspective and didn’t try to
avoid any issues, the main one
here being sexism, specifically
total male domination.

Which is more than I can say
for your editorial. Really, what

 

“Time Story
Labeled As ‘Spineless’

’ Editorial

is a sentence such as ‘This
university's single gender is a
fact of life that is too multi-
faceted to either praise or con-
demn”’ doing in an editorial!?
That isn’t even fluent
bureaucratese, It is a spineless
pontification and an abuse of
your office.

Obviously, W&L has been vic-

tendencies of the mass media.
Well (fortunately for the Phi),
freedom of the press includes
protection of the right to be

proof of insight is seldom a
criterion for renewing one’s

Commentary

 

Autumn Athletes

by John M. Cleghorn

The temperature is falling
more and more every day. With
finals upon us in mid-December
we find that another fall has
passed. Rush, fall homecoming,
parents weekend, and Thanks-
giving have all come and gone.
Leaves have covered the hill
and they have sicked them up
with one of those machines that
you always wished you had had
as a kid raking leaves in the
back yard. Even the first snow
has fallen. But the weather is
only one season of the fall the
first snow has fallen. The fall
season is not only marked by
the weather but four seasons as
well. The fall atheleltes have
packed their equipment and
closed their lockers for another
year, their efforts recorded in a

another crack next fall.

The football team started
their fall with late August after-
noons. Their season turned out
to be more of an indian summer
as theu built winning ways. The
seeds that Gary Fallon planted
four years ago finally bloomed
in a conference title. Not all of
the leaves will return to the tree
next fall though a as seniors
such as Mike Pressler, John
Mckee, and Mike Fogarty move
on. It will be a test to see if the
Generals can return reproduce
another title.

The group on campus that
sees the most of Virginia’s fall
foliage is probably the cross
country team. Just as the

soccer standouts Tad Renner,
Kirk Mancer, and _ Roland

awards recently from the
Virginia Intercollegiate Soccer
Association (VISA) and from
the National Soccer Coaches’

On Tuesday, Dec. 1, Renner
was named to the 11-player
VISA All-State team. A junior
and defensive mainstay from
Raleigh, N.C., Renner becomes
the first W&L All-State player
since Jim Fox received the
honor for the 1974 campaign.

seasons come around every
year, head coach Dick Miller
returned for his twenty ninth
campaign and guided the har-
riers to their twenty first win-
ning season. Several runners
will take their competition in-
side, out of the cold, and run
with the indoor track team. As
for next year, the colors may be
even more brilliant than this
year as the two top runners
return.

It will be a long winter inside
for the soccer team though not
any longer than this fall. The
time inside will be one when in-
juries can heal and morale can
build up again. Rolf Piranian’s
team is a young and skilled one
and with the benéfit of an easier
schedule next fall could be a
much nicer one.

The one group that was
oblivious to the weather was the
polo team. Their 31 wins and
southern league title are the
best mark to date and had it not
been for one Slippery Rock their
pool would have been alot nicer
to swim in. The pool won’t
freeze over this winter though
as many of the polo players
privide the nucles of the swim
team. Page Remillard will see
alot of his players return next
year with the possible addition
of a new recruit or two.

Doremeus Gym is already
filled with the activities of the
winter atheletes but the efforts
of the fall ahtheletes are not to
go unnoticed.

Shenandoah Provides Victory

by G. Bruce Potter

John Lee Graves, George
Spears and Brian Hanson com-
bined for 58 points to lead the
Washington and Lee basketball
team to its first victory of the
season, 94-84 over Shenandoah
College Thursday night at
Warner Center.

The Generals managed to
beat the Hornets’ full-court
pressure early in the game and
jumped out to a 14-6 lead with
16:16 remaining in the first half.
W&L, which upped its record to
1-3, never trailed in the game.

Graves’ jumper gave the
Generals their biggest lead of
the first half at 32-16. The 6-5
sophomore forward led the
team with 22 points to up his
season average to 16.8 points
per game. Junior Frank Eppes
was the leading rebounder with
six rebounds.

Taking a 42-28 lead into the se-
cond half, Washington and
Lee’s defense held Shenandoah
scoreless for the first four
minutes of the final half.
However, in the last 16 minutes,
the Hornets erupted for 56

points to make the final score
respectable.

‘“‘We did not want to get intoa
running game with them,” ex-
plained head coach Verne Can-
field. ‘‘Their 56 second half
points disturbed me a great
deal. We let the tempo get away
from us.”’

With 11:15 left in the game,
Shenandoah, down 57-38, called
a time out to try to get back into
the game. They almost did.

Soni Brown, who led all
scorers with 31 points, scored
six in less than a minute to cut

titles to lead the Washington &

Thursday, Friday, and Satur-
day, Dec. 3-4-5.

Bernot, from Hampton, Va.,
won the 50-yard freestyle event
Thursday evening and the 100-
yard freestyle event Saturday
evening. His time of 21.21
seconds in the 50-yard freestyle
established a new W&L school

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team exploded last
Wednesday night to rout Lynch-
burg College 42-8. ‘‘Things went
our way,” said W&L coach
Gary Franke. ‘‘We got some
breaks and matched up well
against them.’’ The W&L team
as a whole wrestled well, losing
only two bouts the entire night.
150 pound freshman David Har-
rar was named M.V.P. of the
meet.

Following their victory over
Lynchburg, W&L hosted their
eighth annual wrestling invita-

both a school record (breaking
the 46.63 mark he set last year)
and a pool record (breaking a
48.02 standard set in 1972).

“The figures tell the story:
Mike had an_ incredible
weekend,’’ commented _third-
year head coach Page
Remillard, adding that the
lanky competitor also finished
fourth in the 200-yard freestyle
event on Friday and swam on
the 400-yard freestyle relay
team which placed fourth on
Saturday.

“Over the past two years he’s

tion’s best Division III

tional. Among the competing
colleges were Campbell Univer-
sity, Gettysburg, Georgia Tech,
Hiram College, University of
Richmond, V.M.I., and York
College. Despite several close
matches, W&L finished seventh
of eight in the day, and
sophomore captain Tim Val-
liere commented that it was a
“definite improvement” over
last year’s performance.
Valliere, along with 126 pound
freshman Tom Alleva and 177
pound freshman Jeff Dixon
scored fourth place finishes

rungs and should make him a
favorite to win some events at

pionships in March.”

W&L’s fifth place team finish
left the Generals sandwiched
between several of the state’s
largest Universities. Virginia
claimed the crown by rolling up
548 points to nudge runner-up
Virginia Tech at 536. James
Madison was third at 224,
followed by Old Dominion (175),
W&L (147), Richmond (131),
VMI (70) and Virginia Com-
monwealth (68).

Up to this point, Coach
Franke has been pleased with
the character of the team, and
he expresses potential for the
success of this year’s season.
He adds that the team is ‘“‘still
young and make mistakes’’ but
that they have the ability to
learn from them and improve.

RDR, speaking to the ad-
ministration in his letter,
wrote: ‘‘You missed your
chance by giving Chi Psi the old
school house. What a perfect
girls’ dormitory it would have
made. I mean for less than what
it costs to redo the Tucker an-
nex, you could have made a
really nice dorm out of it for say
100-200 girls...and no doubt that
they would have thrown better
parties! Well don’t worry, ‘cuz
you can redeem yourselves
—give Chi Psi SNU’s old house
and you'll have the old school
available for remodeling.”

In the first place Chi Psi was
not ‘‘given’’ their house. Their
national chapter paid the uni-
versity $130,000 to obtain the
structure for them from the city
of Lexington. The local chapter
pays the university a nominal
lease and, in addition, they are
(Sic.) presently repaying a loan
from the school which covered
renovation cost-overruns. To

 

suggest that a girl’s dorm could
throw better parties than a
fraternity house is ludicrous.

As far as giving Chi Psi the
old SNU house that would be out
of the question given the struc-
ture’s present condition.

In conclusion, it was my
understanding that the Phi
didn’t publish anonymous let-
ters. If so, then what is the
reason for making an exception
in Rock Delta Rock’s case?

keep, and thus W&L can expect
to be pigeonholed with its
‘brother’ schools until there are
sister minks. We should pro-
bably feel fortunate that the
Time writer was kept away
from Red Square (especially on
weekend evenings) during her
visit here, since what goes on
there would make tattoos and
neck-straining or whatever look
like pretty tame stuff.

It has always struck me. as
rather warped that with all the
other unique qualities it has to
offer, W&L has chosen the prac-
tice of refusing degrees to
females as some sort of trade-
mark of which to be proud,
because being all-male is a
uniqueness of form rather than
substance.

There is not now and there
never has been a_ valid
academic argument against
coeducation. It is obvious that
reducing the number of male
students admitted in any given

class will allow the University
to accept fewer less-qualified
candidates, and, of course,
totally equal consideration
should be given to female ap-
plicants.

The only valid argument
there has ever been against
coeducation is financial. The

scenario here is that the Univer-

‘selling out’ of going co-ed,
especially from our more con-
servative benefactors. In the
long run, I feel sure that few of
W&L’s friends would abandon
the institution over such a

tangential issue.

How long would W&L suffer
these losses from going co-ed?

Does W&L’s Grading System Cheat Hard Work?

by Scott Mason

There is a sad tragedy which
lingers amidst the competitive,
hustle and bustle atmosphere of
W&L academics, a_ tragedy
which is reflected in the futile
toil of the dedicated, hard work-
ing student. How many times
have students labored tirelessly
in preparation for a test only to
have overlooked some slight
detail which encompassed a
major portion of the exam? Or
how many times have two tests
fallen on the same day and the
misfortunate choice to be made
rested upon sacrificing one for
the other or of studying less
than adequately for both?

Some time ago, in an issue of
last year’s Ring-tum Phi, there

appeared an article in the
“Review and Outlook’’ section
urging students not to ‘‘cheat’’
themselves out of a thorough
education by taking relatively
“gut” courses. It appealed to
students to expand their ‘‘intel-
lectual horizons’’ and to
challenge themselves’ with
academically demanding
courses. Herein, perhaps, lies
one of the greatest American
educational myths.

Once having graduated from
W&L, the boundless search for
jobs begins. As an applicant,
one is equipped with a resume
of his college grades and class
standing. More often than not it
is the mere outcome of one’s
G.P.A. which determines his

post college fate. Indeed, the.
circumstances are exact as
when one first applies to
Washington and Lee for a spot
in the subsequent freshman
class. That the representation
of a human being rests upon a

grade, with almost no insight in- -

to the character of that person,
is most certainly a startling, if
not horrifying, truth. The
weight that grade carries with
it is immense as is the destiny of
the individual which it holds in
its grasp.

One of the greatest assets of
Washington and Lee is that it
presents a highly demanding
range of academic courses,
courses which offer the

valuable opportunity to expand
one’s “‘intellectual horizons.”’
Yet the educational system as a
whole, by overemphasizing the
outcome of one’s grade point
average, cheats the diligent,

hardworking student who is .

earnest in his — pursuit of
knowledge. That which lingers
beyond a student’s G.P.A., the
advantages which he has gain-
ed from his college studies and
the extent by which his
“intellectual horizons’? were
broadened, are excluded from
his college record.

The answer, I fear, may,
nevertheless, lie in taking
“gut’’ courses, those which de-
mand least of an individual’s in-

tellectual ability. As Winter

term rapidly approaches, it
may do well, therefore, to

reconsider one’s chosen course
load which lies ahead in the up-
coming semester. Sadly, the
lone appearance of a grade, it
seems, far outweighs the very
purpose of the American educa-
tional institution. It is a high
price to pay for a student to pur-
sue the expansion of his intellec-
tuality amidst a Sorely misguid-
ed educational system. The
broadening of one’s “‘intellec-
tual horizons” has no place in
the destiny of the college stu-
dent. Rather, it remains an
academic non-essential, an

American educational myth.

In the 30th anniversary year
of its composition, The Cincin-
nati Opera will perform Gian-
carlo Menotti’s Christmas
opera ‘“‘Amahl and the Night

Visitors’ on Sun., Dec. 13, at
2:30 p.m. in the Virginia
Military Institute’s new

Cameron Hall in Lexington.
‘Amahl and the Night

Visitors” is the second of four _

the Rockbridge
37th

events in
Concert-Theatre Series’
season.

The opera was commissioned
by the National Broadcasting
Corporation for a_ television
premiere on Dec. 24, 1951.

After the opera performance,
there will be a reception in

Cameron Hall by the Cincinnati
Opera for the public.

In the first half of the pro-
gram, members of the
‘“‘Amahl”’ cast will sing arias
from the opera repertory. The
three male voices will sing the
Ping-Pang-Pong trio from Puc-
cini’s ‘‘Turandot,’’ an excerpt
from Offenbach’s ‘‘Pericole,”’

The opera will be presented
after the intermission. The
villagers who enter Amahl’s hut
to see the Three Kings will be
sung by members of the Rock-
bridge Chorus who have been
rehearsed by Mr. William Mc-
Corkle.

Season tickets are still
available for the three remain-
ing events at $15 for adults, $10
for college students and $5 for
elementary and high school
students. W&L students are ad-
mitted free of charge. Single ad-
mission tickets are available at
the door. The tickets cost $7.50
for adults and $5 for children.

School Offers Reading Skills Course

As a service to Washington
and Lee students, the Universi-
ty has once again this year
engaged Baldridge Reading
and Study Skills, Inc. to offer on
campus a_ special program
designed to improve reading
and learning skills in academic
subjects.

The program is not merely a
speed-reading course. Its
techniques are designed to in-
crease reading speed, to
strengthen comprehension, to
improve recall, to sustain con-

centration and to deepen

analysis. A student uses his own
classroom reading materials
rather than mass-prepared in-
structional literature and
mechanical training aids.

This program will be con-
ducted on the Washington and
Lee campus by an instructor
from Baldridge Reading from
January 11 through February 5.
Scheduling will be flexible to ac-
commodate individual student
schedules, and classes will be
small to permit necessary in-

dividual attention. Each stu-
dent will attend a total of twenty
sessions, five per week. Tuition
for the program will be $80,
payable by the start of the pro-
gram upon receipt of a state-
ment from Baldridge.

Further information and
registration cards may be ob-
tained from the Office of the
Dean of Students, Payne Hall 6.
Interested students should
register for the course as soon
as possible.

(continued from page 1)
Gregory reported that
newsletters had been posted
around campus to advertise the
Outing Club. So far, the club has
sponsored two canoe trips, two
caving trips and a hiking trip.

Weekly ski trips are planned
for Winter term.

Ariel editor Andrew Trotter
reported that the new issue of
the literary magazine was out
at a cost of about $1000 for 900
copies.

‘“T feel pretty good, I mean,
best yet, about the quality,”
said Trotter.

Trotter said that there were
fewer photography submissions
this year, but that the exclusion
of photography had provided
room for more prose in the

same amount of space used last
year.

The yearbook’s business
manager told the Comnaittee
that contributions from parents
would probably double last
year’s amount. He had received
$5040 from parents, plus $250 for
Monday alone.

Last year’s amount was $2700
in contributions.

Business Manager Scott Fitz-
gerald credited the increase to
getting out letters earlier than
other groups on campus.

In new business, President
Myers mentioned that transfer
and exchange students were ex- -
pected to attend his lecture
tonight at 7 on the Honor
System and independent ex-
aminations.

Applications Available
For Year In Hong Kong

Applications are now being
accepted for Washington and
Lee students interested in spen-
ding a year at Hong Kong’s
Chung Chi College as part of the
exchange program between the
two schools.

Chung Chi, which is part of
the Chinese University of Hong
Kong, is a _ coeducational,
liberal arts college academical-
ly comparable to Washington
and Lee.

But Hong Kong and Lexington
are anything but comparable.
While Hong Kong continues to
observe Chinese traditions, it is
busily involved in the Western
world as a British crown colony.
That double nature affords
American students a unique op-
portunity to become involved in
a rich and varied Chinese
culture with the assurance that
language will not be a major
barrier.

All of the students and faculty
at Chung Chi speak English.

Many courses are offered in
English. The adviser for foreign
students at Chung Chi helps ar-
range a schedule that would be
suitable for most major pro-
grams at Washington and Lee.

Although exchange students
can rely on English while at
Chung Chi, any student in-
terested in the program is
strongly urged to take Chinese
111-112 or Chinese 173 (in
Taiwan) and also to take East
Asian Civilization, History
103-104.

Exchange arrangements are
simple: W&L students pay the
fees for the academic year at
W&L, then exchange places
with a student from Chung Chi
who will spend the academic
year studying here.

For information on the ex-
change program, interested
Students. should contact Pro-
fessor H.J. Pemberton of the
philosophy department.

‘Breaker Morant’ Lauded

by Todd Jones

Coming to the State Theater
is the movie Breaker Morant.
Breaker Morant is a movie
which captured all the top
awards at the 1980 Cannes Film
Festival. The movie was also
nominated for the Oscar for
Best Foreign Film. After seeing
the film, it is obvious why it
received so many accolades.
Breaker Morant is one of the
finest films made in a good
while.

The movie takes place during
the Boer War at the turn of the
century. The English have
developed a special task force
of its armed forces to deal with
Boer terrorist tactics. Put in
charge of this group was a man
named Morant who got the
nickname ‘“‘Breaker’’ because
of his ability to steal horses. The
group developed some different
tactics which became very suc-
cessful. However, for some
reason, Morant is sent up for a
court martial. His charge is kill-
ing the enemy.

Because the courtmartial in-
volves murder, the penalty is

Christmas Gifts and Decorations

death. Two of Morant’s friends
are also in the charge. From the
beginning of the trial, it is ob-
vious that Morant is involved in
a kangaroo court. Each point
brought up by the defense is
knocked down by the tribunal
running the court martial.

The emotions that run
through this film are strong.
Morant must literally fight for
his life, and try to defend his ac-
tions for what he thought was
normal practice. Somehow, he
manages to keep his sense of
humor, and adds some funny

lines throughout the story.

When the film reaches its con-

clusion, it is climaxed by one of .

the best photographed scenes in

a movie this year. The
photography throughout the
film is excellent.

Breaker Morant is a tremen-
dously moving story. One
leaves the theater not only car-
rying the mood of the film, but
also realizing that he has just
seen an excellent movie. In
short, Breaker Morant is the
best movie I’ve seen in the past
few years.

dramatically contrasting pro-
“Il Tabarro,” a pas-
sionate love triangle that ends

with a tinge of tenderness.

The cast for “Il Tabarro”’ will
include Galina Savova as
Giorgetta, Vasile Moldoveanu
as Luigi, and Cornell MacNeil
as Michele. Gilda Cruz Romo
will sing the title role of Suor

W&L’s lead to 13. However,
Canfield said he “was not too
concerned.”

He didn’t need to be as a pair
of free throws by Graves and a
Hanson three-point play erased
any doubt as to the victor of this

game. The last seven minutes
took about half an hour to com-
plete as there were numerous
fouls at both ends of the floor.

The win was slightly sobering
to the Generals as they lost star-
ting guard Billy Yates, a soph-

omore, early in the game due to ©

a back problem. Classmate,
Henry Bond filled in for him and
scored 14 points, however.

W&L shot 65 percent from the
floor, which pleased. Canfield.
“Our high shooting percentage
indicates that; we’re not
shooting from downtown,” he
said.

“We still need to work on our
offensive timing in general. We
need to coordinate the move-
ments of our guards with our
big men,’’ said Canfield.

Another problem that has
plagued the team so far this
year is that of turnovers, but the

eighteenth year coach has
merely chalked that up to a lack
of experience. ‘‘I was more or
less satisfied (with the Shenan-

doah game),’’ Canfield said. ‘‘I
am hard to please, but I was fif-
ty percent pleased.”

The Generals closed out the
1981 portion of their schedule
against Allegheny College last
night at the Warner Center.

Following the Christmas break,
W&L will host Swarthmore Col-
lege on Tues., Jan. 5 at 8 p.m. in

books are housed in the room
that will be named for the Boat-
wrights.

‘We are indeed appreciative
of Mr. Boatwright’s gift and are
honored to name The Boat-
wright Room in memory of
Mrs. Boatwright and their son,
Dr. Robert McDearmon Boat-
wright,’’ said Washington and
Lee president Robert E.R.
Huntley. ‘‘The Boatwright
Room will be, for many years to
come, a place that students,
faculty, alumni, and friends will
use, just as The Boatwright Col-
lection has become an_ in-
valuable and beautiful addition
to the library.”

John G. Boatwright is a
former president of Dibrell
Brothers Inc. in Danville and
was for many years associated
with the leaf tobacco industry.
Dan's Hill, the Boatwright’s
home near Danville, is well
known both for the beauty of its

gardens and_its_ historic
significance.
Mrs. Boatwright was the

ington and both the master’s
and Ph.D. degrees from the
University of California at
Berkeley.

Prior to joining the faculty at
Vanderbilt in 1950, Dragnich
served as cultural attache and
public affairs officer for the
American Embassy in Bel-
grade, Yugoslavia.

Dragnich held the Chester W.
Nimitz Chair at the U.S. Naval
War College in 1959-60. He is

former president of the
Southern Political Science
Association.

daughter of the late Senator
Carter Glass, former senior

senator from Virginia and
former secretary of the
treasury under Woodrow

Wilson. He was president of
Carter Glass & Sons Publishers
Inc., publishers of the Lynch-
burg (Va.) News and Daily Ad-
vance. ;

Dr. Robert McDearmon Boat-
wright entered Washington and
Lee after graduating from
Woodberry Forest School. He
studied medicine at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania School of
Medicine, earning his M.D.
degree in 1945. After serving an
internship at Delaware Hospital
in Wilmington, Del., he entered
the medical corps of the US.
Army and served until 1948
when he returned to Philadel-
phia to pursue further graduate
studies. He became a diplomate
in otolaryngology and further
specialized in bronchology. He
had a private practice in
Philadelphia and was on the
staff of four of that city’s
hospitals.

 

(continued from page 1)

In 1967 came the premiere of Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead, which the London
Observer hailed as ‘‘the most brilliant debut of the
sixties.’’ Stoppard went on to write Jumpers
(1972), Travesties (1975) and Night and Day
(1978). His latest work is On the Razzle, an adap-
tion of a 19th century farce written by an Austrian
monk named Johan Nestroy. It is the original
source of Thornton Wilder’s The Matchmaker.

Stoppard’s work, placed in the modern absur-
dist tradition, has drawn comparisons to that of
Oscar Wilde, Samuel Beckett, Harold Pinter and
Edward Albee, but it remains unique.

As he would explain in his Glasgow Committee-

_ sponsored lecture (The Text and the Event) that

night, Stoppard is far more interested in the actual
performance of a play than in the ‘‘academic
aspect”’ of writing it.

“Plays aren’t written for study,” he explained.
“It’s an event rather than a script. Plays are writ-
ten to be seen, not read.”’

The playwright becomes actively involved with
the staging of his works, although he professes no
desire to direct ‘‘as such. It’s too time consuming.
My writing time is quite precious as it is.”

Stoppard was asked if it is possible for an actor
to be too smart (recalling a quote in an earlier in-
terview). “It doesn’t hurt to be too smart in any
occupation,”’ he said. “I suppose an actor can
over-intellectualize from the inside — which holds
good for writers like (Neil) Simon and (Thornton)
Wilder. I have a sense of the surface of a produc-
tion. A play makes a certain kind of noise.”’

He attends other plays occasionally, but said ‘‘I
go as a playgoer, not a playwright.” Which of his
own plays does he like best? ‘There isn’t one, real-
ly. [can’t say one’s a favorite particularly.”

He finds immediate criticism ‘‘interesting”’ as
the first real comment on his work, but it fades
with time, and ‘when I find an old cutting in a
drawer, it’s of no interest.”

His views on U.S. culture are interesting and
rarely negative. On aspects of his first chosen pro-
fession, comparing tube to type:

“Television journalism is more efficient — it’s
shocking, has more impact,” he said. But print “‘is
much more important in the long-run. It’s not as
discardable as pictures” briefly flashed on the
screen.

He finds obvious differences in the press of this
country and his own. British newspapers aren ‘tas

  

| WHITE FRONT

‘‘naked about their dependence on advertising,’’
he said. ‘‘It doesn’t hit you every time you open the
paper. The New York Times — there’s an eight
column ad for Bergdorf Goodman and one column
of news. Then Macy’s, Brooks Brothers, Lord &
Taylor...”

‘American T.V. journalism is famous for its
crassness all over the world. I don’t object to it at
all,” he said, blaming the ratings rat race. ‘‘A free
press is the last bastion — when you lose a free
press, you lose a free society. That’s it.” ‘

Stoppard talked about the Committee for a Free
World, with which he says he has a “‘loose connec-
tion.”’ A description of what the organization is
about highlighted his own beliefs.

The committee, he said, ‘thas no right/left,
East/West ax to grind as such. The issues are
moral, not political — there is a certain way
governments should behave toward each other.
People are in jail for expression of views — ab-
solute commonplace activities we take for
granted.”

On American television he’s seen in England:
‘“‘They make things very well.’’ He thinks that
Johnny Carson’s recent entry into British T.V.
was oversold, resulting in a critical backlash.

‘(Carson’s) popularity in the states is amazing
and it must be deserved. I admire him a lot — I ad-
mire anyone who can think on his feet like that.”

On American theater: How does he, a
playwright of high calibre, regard Broadway’s
glaring stretch of flashy, expensive and otherwise
unimportant musicals and revivals? ‘‘While that
description is frequently made,” he said, ‘I’m

sure there are some fine plays written over here
that I’d never see.”’

What’s he working on now?

‘““A contemporary play — realistic, quiet conver-
sation with no show business pizazz.’’ Was he
referring to a play called A Quiet Room he’d men-
tioned in an earlier interview?

“Well, actually it’d be ten different rooms.”’

Stoppard was reportedly pleasant company in
the bookstore that afternoon, at a private dinner
later at the Palms, and in his speech. Considering
that he has had scant experience on the campus
lecture circuit, his talk, delivered without notes,
was a definite crowd pleaser. The crowd in Lee
Chapel included people from as far away as Rich-
mond, but was conspicuously absent of many
students.

JAN 8 1982

 

by Todd Smith

W&L Biology Professor Gary
H. Dobbs III, 33, shot and killed
himself in his cabin home on the
morning of Dec. 31. His body
was found the next day by
President Robert E. R. Huntley
and three others.

Speaking at Monday’s faculty
meeting, Huntley said that in a
letter Dobbs stated he was un-
satisfied with his personal and
professional achievement and
would take his life.

Dobbs’ remains were cremat-
ed without a service and will be
scattered this afternoon at 5:00
on the front campus by Presi-
dent Huntley.

“In the fall we will have a new
person,”’ said Thomas Nye,
chairman of the Biology depart-
ment.
able to replace what the univer-
sity has lost, what the depart-
ment has lost, and, most of all,

 

“But we will never be

what the students have lost.’

Dobbs, awarded a Ring-tum
Phi award last year for
“epitomizing a  gentleman,”’
was a popular figure on cam-
pus. He had 30 advisees, more
than anyone in the department,
and still had to turn students
away.

Dobbs entered Washington
and Lee as a student in 1966, the
year Nye began teaching here.
‘By the time he was a senior he
was totally devoted to the ideals
and traditions of Washington
and Lee,” said Nye.

Nye and Huntley both said
that no matter how successful
Dobbs was, he could never be
fully satisfied. Huntley stressed
that Dobbs felt this way since
before he entered W&L.

“I believe he carried that
burden as long as I’ve known
him,” said Nye.

“There is no guilt to be

assumed by the faculty, the me
students or the family.”
‘A videotape with a personal

message to each member of the |

(Biology) department for what
they had meant to him” was
left, according to Nye. Dobbs

had been in charge of writing }

guidelines for the department's
new video equipment.

Letters were left for col-
leagues, the Ring-tum Phi, the
president and his father.
Flowers were sent by Dobbs to
secretaries in Washington Hall.

His message to the Ring-tum

Phi included an open letter to 4
his advisees (printed on page |

2);

his mail a letter from Dobbs
postmarked in Lexington Dec.
31. The letter directed Huntley

to find Dobbs’ will in the pro- °

fessor’s office.

on the board of directors of the
Gilbert and Sullivan Associa-
tion of Princeton, N.J., and has
played numerous lead roles
with that company.

He is co-director of the
Princeton Religion Research
Center and a member of ad-
visory councils of the depart-
ments of sociology and religion
at Princeton. He is on the board
of directors of The Roper Public

tact symposium was former in-
terior secretary Stewart Udall.

S.A.B. Appears Before E.C..

by Ben Jarratt

The Student Activities Board
presented its monthly budget
report, including an estimated
Fancy Dress budget of $55,000,
at the E.C. meeting on Monday
night.

The Executive Committee
also heard reports from the Stu-
dent Emergency Loan Commit-
tee, the Cold Check Committee
and the Computer Club.

“The whole idea of a budget
scares me,’’ stated SAB co-
chairman John Martin. The
SAB can only estimate ex-
penses and past Fancy Dress
Balls have lost money.

Co-chairman Blake Wither-

ington added the SAB spent
$38,000 last year after setting a
budget of $31,000.

Fancy Dress will be held in
Warner Gym, allowing for
larger crowds. Both co-
chairmen said increased ticket
sales should provide extra
revenue.

Fancy Dress will be open to
alumni this year, according to
Martin. The W&L Alumni
Magazine has written an article
about the upcoming ball and the
Alumni House is compiling a
list of alumni over the past ten
years. Martin added over 600
letters will be mailed out about
the Ball. He also expressed in-

 

 

Darrell, S.A.B, Agree On
D-Hall Concert Program

by John Wells

The Student Activities Board
is planning a busy winter term
that will include the ground-
breaking initiative of featuring
musical entertainment in
Evans Dining Hall.

SAB co-chairman John Mar-
tin expresses hope that a Jan. 16
appearance in the dining hall by
a Jamaican reggae band will
open the doors for similar
events in the future. Food Ser-
vices Director Jerry Darrell
has restricted activity there to
Fancy Dress, The Superdance
and the S.A.B.U. Ball due to
damage inflicted by rowdy
students when a band played
there some years ago.

Darrell has given Martin and
Bob Schmidt the go ahead for
the upcoming event due largely
to their success in other
endeavors. It was their popular
“Tuesdays at the Pit’ concert
program that helped pull Dar-
rell’s financially troubled
Cockpit out of the red last fall.

Martin stresses that student
attendance and behavior at the
Evans concert will determine
whether such special events
will be staged there in the
future. Due to Darrell’s concern
that disorderly conduct might
violate a Virginia ABC Board
ordinance, there will be heavy
security at the concert, and

terest in contacting P.M
Magazine about covering the
weekend event.

Witherington said students
will be allowed to bring guests,
but this will probably be limited
to only one guest ticket per stu-
dent.

“It’s a school function,”
stated Witherington. ‘‘The SAB
wants to limit the number of
non-W&L students. Advanced
tickets will cost $25-$30 at the
door.

Martin added the SAB will be
sponsoring a ‘Reggae Party”
Friday, January 15, in Evans
Dining Hall.

“It’s got to be a success,”
stated Martin. ‘‘The dining hall
could be a potential alternative
for concerts.”’

Martin added Gerald Darrell,
director of the dining hall, was
concerned about potentia!
abuse of the hall by students.
Extra security will be added to
prevent any trouble.

Kip Gordon won the SAB
Backgammon Tournament
First prize was a free ski trip
for two to Snowshoe. Martin
also added he was still working
with the Ring-tum Phi over get
ting lower advertising rates.

Eric Kolts reported that the
Student Emergency Loan Com-
mittee gave out eight loans
totaling $1010 just before the
Christmas Break.

‘Most of the students needed
money to go home,”’ said Kolts
One needed to get his car fixed
and another needed money for
gas

REVIEW azd OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Gary Hobson Dobbs III

The passing away of Gary Dobbs is an unfortunate
loss that has left this campus both saddened and
shocked. Dr. Dobbs was a man greatly admired for
both his personal charm and his professional talents.
While he expected the highest standards from his
students, he vowed, above all else, to make himself
available to anyone in need. Few professors can make
the same boast.

Dr. Dobbs’ final choice leaves one bewildered. Why
would a man with so many things apparently in his ~
favor arrive at such a conclusion? The answer, it
seems, is that Gary Dobbs made a choice that ap-
peared sensible to him but for us was unfortunate.

We may never fully understand how the human
mind operates. Likewise, there is no justification for
Gary Dobbs’ decision — it ended the life of a man who
had much to give.

Gary Dobbs provided us with knowledge, dignity
and compassion. For these reasons he will be greatly
missed by all.

Dobbs

(continued from page 1)

Huntley called Dean Watt and
Eric Sisler, University At-
torney, and went to Dobbs’ of-
fice in Parmly Hall. There he
found the will and other per-
sonal documents in careful
order.

Huntley located Dr. William
Old, and went to Dobbs’ home in

many weeks or even months
ago.”’ The will, which has yet to
be made public, names the
university as executor.

Dobbs stipulated that the
W&L make no official state-
ment nor hold any type of
memorial service. Huntley has
expressed his desire to comply
with this wish and the news of-

“He was such an articulate spokesman

for the teaching profession and the
way Washington and Lee tries
to work with its students.”’

 

 

Ben Salem Cabin, with Watt
and Sisler. Breaking down the
door, they found Dobbs dead of
a wound inflicted by a_ .38-
caliber pistol.

It was estimated that Dobbs
shot himself between 3 and 4
a.m. on Dec. 31.

Dobbs was: examined by Dr.
F.A. Feddeman and taken to
the Harrison Funeral Home.

The will was dated Dec. 17,
and Huntley told the faculty
that ‘from these documents
and other circumstances, it is
clear that Dr. Dobbs’ prepara-
tions for his own death began

fice issued no releases on the
situation.

The amount of his bequest to
the university will be released
when the will becomes probate.

Dobbs is survived by his
sister and his father, who lives

- in Birmingham, Ala. The two

will be in Lexington this after-
noon for the distribution of
Dobbs’ ashes.

Dobbs was bern in Birm-
ingham in 1948. He graduated
from Washington and Lee with
a B.S. in biology and the highest
grade point average in his

class. He was a member of the .

Sigma Chi social fraternity, the
freshman honor society and Phi
Beta Kappa.

Dobbs earned his Ph.D. at the
University of Calfornia at San
Diego. He did further graduate
work at the University of
Chicago and Duke Medical
School.

Though still a young man,
Dobbs had published three of
his own articles and co-
authored six more.

Dobbs was granted tenure
last year as an associate pro-
fessor and became eligible to
take a sabbatical. He declined
it.

Dobbs’ eagerly participated
in special conferences and
alumni workshops. He greeted
incoming freshmen, and ad-
dressed the class of ’83 during
its freshman orientation. He
spoke at last year’s senior ban-
quet.

“We called on him several
times and he was always
delightful,” said Frank Par-
sons, Assistant to the President.
“He was such an articulate
spokesman for the teaching pro-
fession and the way Washington

and Lee tries to work with its |

students.”

D.C. Applications Sought

Applications are invited for
the positions of Freshman Dor-
mitory Counselors for the
1982-83 academic year. These
positions are among the most
responsible entrusted to
Washington and Lee students.

On the basis of past ex-
perience, certain guidelines for
the selection of Dormitory
Counselors have been establish-
ed. Applicants must be at least

current sophomores, and should
not have commitments after
8:00 p.m. which would routinely
take them away from the dor-
mitory for any appreciable
time. While counselorships are
not awarded on an academic
basis, a student who has failed
to maintain a 2.0 average would
probably not be selected. Any
counselor who is placed on

Two Matches Scheduled

 

Wrestlers To Visit N.Carolina

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team will take its 1-1
record to North Carolina this
weekend for matches with
Campbell College Friday and
Duke Saturday.

On Friday, January’ 8 the
Generals will visit Buies Creek
to face Campbell University. On’
Saturday, Jan. 9 the team will
be in Durham for a contest with
Duke University.

“Along with VMI, whom we ,.

faced back in December, these
are the toughest opponents on
the schedule,’’ comments ninth-
year head coach Gary Franke
on the foes, both of which are
members of the NCAA Division
| category while the Generals

belong to Division III. ‘We %

compete against these teams on
a regular basis, taking on Duke
ina dual match each season and
having Campbell come to our
Invitationals.”’

Coach Gary Franke and
Sophomore Captain Tim
Valliere are encouraged by the
Generals’ start and believe that
the team’s 10 freshmen will be
able to make a contribution.
Said Valliere, ‘“‘They’ve been
here for a whole term and
should be familiar with the pro-
gram by now.”

As for the upcoming matches,
Franke said ‘I hope we can
match up in the lower weight
divisions.” Most of the starting
spots in 118 to 150 pound classes

 

are held by the freshmen.

‘I'ne Generals will take a 1-1
record into the trip, the results
being a 42-8 win over Lynchburg
College and a 25-14 loss to VMI.
The Duke and Campbell con-
tests are two of 11 total dual
matches for W&L this season.

W&L’s line-up for the trip is
complete with the exception of
the 167-pound class, which
Franke says will be finalized

John Cleghorn

 

Over the Christmas break
most of us had more than our
fill of football. Almost every
other day of the holiday we
were treated to some bowl
game featuring two teams that
we know almost nothing about.
| Most of these games are mean-
ingless in the final standings but
are intended to give the players
and coaches some type of
honor. One has to wonder what
kind of honor it is to have to
practice for a month after the
season and be away from your
family and friends during the
holiday for one game.

Realistically, there are four
or five important bowls that
have bearing on the final stan-
‘dings and the determination of
,the national champion. Iron-
‘ically, all these bowls take
| place on the same day and what
some college teams have work-
_ed for virtually the year round
_is decided within a matter of
hours. Maybe they had a better
idea in 1951.

In 1951, one of the earliest
years of the national college
football poll, there were only
four bowls after the regular
season, the Orange, Rose,
Gator, and, Sugar bowls. In that
same season the Washington
and Lee Generals compiled an
8-2 season and, as a participant
in major college competition,
were ranked as high as thir-
teenth in the nation.

 

W&L greats as Joe McCutch-
eon, Jim Stark and the
‘General of the Generals” Gil
'Bocetti, an option quarterback
heralded as ‘‘the master of the
fake and the pitchout.’’ At the
end of the 1951 season, after
playing Maryland, North
Carolina, Virginia Tech, and
Florida among others, the
Generals had only fallen to
number one ranked Tennessee
and highly ranked University of
Virginia. This impressive per-
formance earned the Generals
an invitation to the Gator Bowl.

 

These were the days of such

Bowled Over At

Christmas Time

The game pitched an
underated W&L team against
an undefeated Wyoming squad,
one of the three most im-
pressive teams in the country.
Wyoming brought a threatening
running attack with Vern Gale,
a wingback, Eddie Talboom, a
triple threat all-American
tailback, and an all-conference
blocking back Dick Campbell.

A major break for Wyoming
was the timely arrival of appen-
dicitis for W&L leader Walt
Michaels now head coach of the
New York Jets. Michaels, a
player of double worth for his”
work as a fullback and line-
backer, came down with appen-
dicitis only twenty-four hours
before the game in Jackson-
ville. That loss proved to be
critical for the Generals.

A crowd of 26,000 fans, 5,000
from W&L, attended the New
Year’s day game billed as ‘‘the
battle between the West and the
South.”” The cowboys of Wyom-
ing struck with two touchdowns
in the second quarter and
another in the third. The
Generals could only muster a
late fourth quarter touchdown
as the game ended in a 20-7 vic-
tory and a perfect season for
Wyoming.

Athletic Director Bill
McHenry, then a member of the
W&L freshmen squad, remem-
bers that game as one of the last
great games in that era of

_Generals football. W&L drop-

ped from major college com-
petition in 1953 and has since
become a member of NCAA
division three competition.

Nowadays in the light of such
subspecies as the tangerine and
peach bowls and_ other
honorable events such as the
astro-bluebonnet bowl
(whatever an astro bluebonnet
is), a bowl invitation is not such
a respected thing. Maybe they
had a better idea in 1951.

Cagers Win, Now At .500

by G. Bruce Potter

John Lee Graves and Brian
Hanson paced a 16-4 scoring
spree midway through the se-
cond half as the Washington and
Lee basketball team evened
their record at 3-3 with a 62-53
victory over Swarthmore Col-
lege Tuesday night.

The Generals had the lead at
the half by a count of 23-18, but
Swarthmore, playing an ag-
gressive defense, came back to
take a 26-24 lead with 14:45 left
in the game. Hanson, who led
the Generals with 16 points, hit

a jumper from the left side and
a bank shot to give W&L a two

point lead.
Following Swarthmore’s Ron
Bradley’s . third consecutive

basket to knot the score at 28 for

the final time, Graves con-
nected on four straight free
throws to give W&L the lead
that they would never relin-
quish.

Swarthmore had kept the
game close through the first
half by playing a patient of-
fense, taking only wide open
shots. This way, they managed
to jump out to a 4-0 lead, but the
Generals came back and quick-
ly tied the score at six.

Washington and Lee was also
helped by two technicals called
on the Swarthmore coaching
staff as Graves, who finished
with 15 points, hit on all four of

the foul shots.
The game was all but sealed

for W&L when Graves hit
from the left side, was fouled,

General Facts

The Washington and Lee
basketball team will host
Haverford (Pa.) College and
Bethany (W.Va.) College this
weekend in the 13th annual
W&L Invitational. Those two
teams will square off at 7:30
tonight, with the loser meeting
W&L at 7:30 tomorrow night
and the winner at 7:30 on Satur-
day night in the round-robin af-
fair.

Haverford brings a 5-4 record
and the nation’s leading defense
(45.2 points per game) into the
tourney while Bethany was 3-2
prior toa Tuesday game versus
Denison College of Ohio.

The 0.D.A.C., in cooperation
with the N.C.A.A., will experi-
ment this winter by opening all
conference basketball games
with an in-bounds pass instead
of the common jump ball. Vis-
iting team captains will have
the choice of first possession or
defense of a particular basket.
After the initial in-bounds pass,
possession in jump ball situa-
tions will be awarded on an
alternating basis. (NOTE: In
case of overtime contests, a
jump ball will be used to open
each overtime period.) In addi-
tion to oonference games,

this experimental procedure
with those non-conference op-
ponents who agree to such use.

Also in ODAC news a resolu-
tion was made in reference to
two instances of post graduate
competitors in conference com-
petition. A motion was made
and a second received that non-
students or those students with-
out athletic eligibility by NCAA
or ODAC standards may not
compete in any intercollegiate
athletic event. Motion received
unanimous adoption.

~ Nine of the twelve teams that
compete at Washington and Lee
have winning records from
their first season to date. The
total won-loss record as of this
fall is 3681-3333-138. The oldest
team on campus is the football
squad which started competi-
tion in 1873. The most recent ad-
dition is the lacrosse team
which debued in 1977.

The selection committee that
named 1958 W&L Cager Stand-

‘out to an all-American team

showed great insight. What
makes the story surprising is
that among his all-American
teammates were Oscar Robert-
son, Elgin Baylor, Bob Boozier,
and Wilt Chamberlin.

 

 

    
   
     
     
 

 

  

but missed the free throw.
However, sophomore Chris
Baldwin pulled down the re-
bound and fired around the
court to Graves, who made the
hoop from the same location as
he had only seconds before.
This gave the Generals a 46-37
lead with only 6:30 remaining.

Despite Graves’ fouling out
with 3:51 left, W&L clinched the
victory by sinking eight of their
last 11 shots from the charity
stripe. For the game, they hit 22
of 28 (78.6%) from the line and
20 of 36 (55.5%) from the floor.
The Generals had been ranked
third in shooting percentage
and fifth in free throw percen-
tage in the nation entering the
contest.

However, one of the con-
tributors to those statistics,
sophomore guard Henry Bond,
failed to meet the academic
guidelines required by the
university and was subsequent-
ly dismissed. Bond, who had
started the Generals last game
against Allegheny College, was
averaging 10.8 points per game
and was hitting on 72% of his
shots. Billy Yates, who scored
five points Tuesday night, is
replacing him in the lineup.

The team had closed out their
pre-vacation portion of the
schedule by downing Allegheny
College 67-62 on Dec. 9. In that
matchup, junior reserve for-
ward Jay Fechtel only scored
four points, but they were
perhaps the most crucial of the
game for W&L. With 6:28 left in
the game, Allegheny, who had

The Ring-tum Phi, January 7, 1982, Page 5

 

trailed by nine, 33-24, at the
half, took the lead 54-53.
However, Fechtel first tapped
in a George Spears shot that
was off the mark and then hit a
shot himself to give the
Generals a 57-54 lead with only
3:40 remaining in the game.
Allegheny pulled within one at
57-56, but Graves, who scored 18
points and led the team with ten
rebounds, hit two free throws to
ice the game.

Hanson led the squad with 20
points, and he also pulled down

seven boards. Bond added 14
points, including an 8-11 perfor-
mance from the foul line.

Head Coach Verne Canfield
said the win over Allegheny
“cured a lot of ills as it showed
the team is gaining character.”
He was still lamenting over the
number of turnovers (19) that
his team had committed and
also their poor execution on of-
fense several times down the
floor.

Review:

A Poorly-Tuned ‘Sharkey’s Machine’

by Todd Jones
Sharkey’s Machine is_ the
latest’ Burt Reynolds film.

Reynolds also directs this
movie, which is very poor.

Burt plays a cop who ‘‘nobody
owns.’’ After chasing down a
drug dealer who kills a bus
driver, Reynolds is transferred
from narcotics to the vice

squad. While investigating

some high-class hookers,

Reynolds discovers that the
next governor of the state
employs one of them. Since
Reynolds is such a good cop
(not to mention star and direc-
tor of the film), he asks for a 24-
hour surveillance of the most
attractive hooker, a woman
named Dominoe, and naturally
gets it. To no one’s surprise, he
falls in love with her, after tak-
ing pictures of her day and
night.

We soon discover that the

decides that the girl is no good,
so after one last evening with

blow her up with a gun that

Citizen Kane (1941) Often and deservedly cited as the finest
American film, Orson Welles’ brilliant study in power and corrup-
tion is as entertaining as any great movie deserves to be. It’s
technical advances dramatically altered the look of American
films for years to come. The subject matter was blatantly and scan-
dalously lifted from the life of newspaper baron W.R. Hearst,
operating quite a stir at the time. The editing and acting are fan-
tastic, with performances by Welles, Joseph -Cotten, Everett

W&L Receives $135,000 Donation
To Support Anthropology Reasearch

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has established an endowed
program to support student
research in anthropology as the
result of three anonymous gifts
made to the university.

The gifts, totaling $135,000,
have enabled the university to
establish an endowment to fund
the Leyburn Scholars Program
in Anthropology. The program
is named in honor of Dr. James
G. Leyburn, former dean of the
college.

The Leyburn Scholars Pro-
gram is designed to further the
study and research in an-
thropology at W&L by enabling
the university to provide
stipends for students engaging
in that research. Funds from
the endowment may also be us-
ed for the purchase of equip-
ment and for the support of

publication of reports on the
research.

Among his many contribu-
tions to Washington and Lee,
Leyburn was instrumental in
the development of teaching
and research in anthropology at
the university.

Responding to the establish-
ment of the endowment pro-
gram in his name, Leyburn
said: ‘‘The pursuit of excellence
among its students and the en-
couragement of their scholar-
ship are among the primary
purposes of a university, It
pleases me greatly to know that
students in anthropology,
thanks to the Scholars Pro-
gram, will now have both the in-
centive and the means to do
scholarly research.”’

Leyburn retired from active
teaching at W&L in 1972, He was

people, but I don’t have a thou-
sand dollars’’ (the hooker’s go-
ing rate). Eventually things get
hot for Burt, who still pushes
forward and eventually gets all
the bad guys. :

If you enjoy watching person
after person getting pumped
with lead, this movie is for you.
Someone is shot every seven
minutes in the film by every
type of gun imaginable, in-
cluding a harpoon gun. I would
be hesitant to be Sharky’s next
partner, for every person he
works with in the film ends up
lying on the floor with eight or
nine bullets in him.

Also featured in the film are
Earl Holloman, who plays the
governor-elect; Vittorio
Gassman, the mafioso chief;
and Rachel Ward, the hooker.
Charles Durning plays a vice-
squad chief who is more con-
cerned with his retirement than
with catching criminals. Also in
the film is Brian Keith, who
plays an old cop. We are told
that he could “‘wrestle a train,”

but he spends his screen time
ambling around with food in his
hands. It’s hard picturing ‘‘Un-
cle Bill’’ constantly stuffing
food in his face, making crude
jokes about hookers, and using
“nasty language.” Really, what
would Buffy and Jody think?

Sharkey’s Machine is a film
with little plot and even less
entertainment. All Reynolds
does is run through the film be-
ing a peeping tom, shooting up
people, and losing fingers. Burt
uses witty phrases like ‘‘I’ve got
your ass in my hand” and
““You’re a piece of s--t in a
toilet, and I’m going to flush
you!” With witty statements
like that, he endears himself to
a $1000-a-night hooker, but to no
one else, especially not the au-
dience.

While the film might be enter-
tainment to total Burt Reynolds
freaks or sadists, I’m trying to
forget this movie and think
about Burt’s upcoming film The
Best Little Whorehouse in Tex-
as, It has to be better than
Sharkey’s Machine.

E.C. secretary Bennett Ross
asked how many loans were
committee approved. Kolts
replied he gave out two and the
committee approved six.

He added his committee may
advertize about student loans in
the school newspaper, but he
did not want students to take ad-
vantage of the program.

Randall Jacoby reported the
Cold Check Committee has
picked up 102 bad checks since
its last report. Of these checks
71 are still outstanding.

Jacoby added that about $200
worth of the checks belong to
graduated students. He thought
the committee would write

these checks off as a loss.

E.C. president Eric Myers
said the committee should
notify the Registrar’s Office of
these debts and have the
transcripts held up. This has
proven to be an effective way of
collecting money for bounced
checks.

Jacoby replied he was not
aware of this policy and would
have his committee consider it.

Myers also recommended
that some form of legal letter be
sent to the alumni notifying
them of their debt.

tickets will be sold, and Martin
says that tickets sold at the door
will cease as soon as the 600th is
purchased.

Martin emphasizes that stu-
dent support will be crucial to
open ‘‘new facets of entertain-
ment” at the university in a
variety of musical styles.

Variety, preached and prac-
ticed by Martin’s predecessor
Jamie Small, is evident in
bands scheduled to appear each
Tuesday night in the Cockpit
throughout the term. The new
season was inaugurated with a
performance by The Movies on
Tuesday night. Future bands in-
clude Roomful of Blues, a
popular feature at last year’s
Fancy Dress, on Jan. 12; The
Showmen, a soul band slated for
Jan. 19; Virginia Fire on Jan.
27; Steve Bassett and the
Virginia Breeze on Feb. 2:
Brice Street on Feb. 23; Billy
Price and the Keystone Rhythm
Band on March 2; Little Big
Band on March 9; The Motive
on March 16; and another reg-
gae band called Hooters on
March 23.

Non-Tuesday' night ap-
pearances' scheduled for
February include the Alabama-
based Telluride on the 5th and
The Deal, a ‘‘hot new band”’
from Charlottesville, on the
27th.

Martin and Schmidt are at-
tempting to maintain estab-

lished and high quality bands
while diversifying, i.e. the soul
bands, to appeal to a larger au-
dience. As it is, he feels, the
Cockpit is getting the same
turnover week after week. He is
also seeking increased publicity
for the groups who do appear in
order to increase student in-
terest.

Other upcoming events in-
clude the weekly SAB film
series, the lacrosse team’s an-
nual fund raiser at Zollman’s
Pavilion on Jan. 22, and the
Muscular Dystrophy Super-
dance to be held Jan. 29 and 30.

game was the fact that

‘This has happened to us occa-
sionally in the past,”’ said Can-
field. ‘‘It just shows that we are

pline.”’

The Generals now take their

tional this Friday and Saturday

two teams will meet tonight at

’ by Scott Mason

“A mammoth undertaking”
are the words of Student Activi-
ty’s Board (SAB) Co-Chairman
John Martin in expressing the
75th annual Fancy Dress Ball.
Indeed, said Martin, this year’s
ball will be an event ‘“‘un-
precedented in SAB history.”’

Co-Chairmen Martin and
Blake Witherington along with
University Center chairman
Bob Schmidt are faced with a
precarious situation. Because
the 75th annual is to take place
in W&L’s Warner Gymnasium,
as opposed to the Student
Center where the Ball has been
held in previous years, the SAB
has no past records by which to
base its projected budget.

 

Fancy Dress Move
Complicates Plans

Since the gymnasium is able
to accommodate a_ greater
number of people, the amount
of supplies needed for decora-
tions, furnishings, and lighting
equipment must simply be
estimated at best. The SAB is
relying heavily upon a large at-
tendance in order to compen-

sate for much of the $55,000. be-

ing spent to finance the occa-
sion.

Whereas other Fancy Dress
balls have been limited solely to
W&L students and faculty, this
year’s endeavor will also in-
clude alumni and friends. An
estimated 4,000 people are ex-
pected to fill the gymnasium
and the SAB stresses for those

Mrs. Miller To Leave

Secretary to the Dean of
Students Betty Miller will leave
her job at the end of this month.

“It’s just time,”’ Mrs. Miller
said when asked why she ‘is
leaving. She plans to ‘‘take it
easy for a few months’’ and
then seek part-time employ-
ment elsewhere.

Mrs. Miller is perhaps better
known than most campus secre-
taries because she deals direct-
ly with a broad cross section of
the student body. Freshmen ap-
preciate having their names
remembered by someone who
reminds them of their best
friend’s mom. Her cheerful
smile and consoling words have
sent more than a few students
into Dean Lewis John’s office to
discuss academic difficulties.

‘‘We’re going to miss her very
much around here,’’ Dean John
said earlier this week. Similar
thoughts were expressed by
Dean Robert Huntley and
scores of students.

Mrs. Miller came to W&L in

Prior to W&L, she worked at

Old Man Winter Hits Big Lex

Harsh winter conditions have
made life in Lexington difficult,
if not hazardous, during the
past week. Last weekend’s sub-
zero temperatures and brisk
winds were followed by a storm
that dumped snow on Lexington
Tuesday night and all day
Wednesday. At the last count,
the storm had left aproximately
eight inches of snow on the
ground.

The W&L infirmary reports
that the past week has not been
the best as far as students’
health is concerned. The
number of flu cases has increas-
ed and many students have
been bothered with a stomach
virus. The infirmary recom-
mends dressing warmly before
going outside and keeping as
much of the body covered as
possible.

The secretary’s job will be
filled by Penny Henneman, wife
of the assistant law school dean
and a leader in the local United
Way.

Mrs. Miller received a Ring-
tum Phi award in 1980,

E.C. Ponders Reports,
Gets New Speaker List

by Ben Jarratt

Contact announced several
guest speakers at Monday
night’s Executive Committee
meeting.

The E.C. also heard reports
from the Ring-tum Phi, the In-
ternational Club, the Outing
Club and the Fencing Club.

Mike Drinkwater and Robert
McLean, co-chairmen of Con-
tact, stated their committee has
signed the following speakers:

—Arthur Miller, professor of
law at Harvard, on Jan. 26.

—F. Lee Bailey, one of the na-
tion’s top defense lawyers, on
Feb. 4.

—Robert Hughes, art critic
for Time Magazine, on March 31.

Contact is sponsored jointly
by the Interfraternity Council
and the Executive Committee.
The first speaker this: year,
Stewart Udall, cost over $2,200.
This figure included an

honorarium fee, transportation,
dinner and reception. The se-
cond speaker, George Gallup,
cost over $2,500.

Both Drinkwater and McLean
said that Contact’s budget
should last to the end of the
school year. Out of a beginning
budget of $19,925, Contact has
spent over $6,600 on speaker
fees and other expenses.

“We are looking into the
possibility of having F. Lee
Bailey in Evans Dining Hall,”
stated Drinkwater. ‘‘The dining
hall has a greater seating
capacity than Lee Chapel,
which holds only 550 people.”’

Trent Dickerson, business
manager for the Ring-tum Phi,
presented the newspaper’s
budget report. The Phi had ex-
penses totaling $3,500.

Dickerson said ‘tthe Phi may

Gallup Analyzes Reagan Popularity

by Todd Smith

President Reagan’s approval
rating in polls of the American
public has slipped below the 50
percent mark for the first time
in his administration, said
pollster George Gallup Jr.
Thursday, Jan. 7.

Speaking at Lee Chapel,
Gallup said that Reagan’s first-
year average in the popularity
polls is slightly below those of
Jimmy Carter and Richard Nix-
on ‘‘and is considerably lower
than the first-year ratings given
John Kennedy and Dwight

Eisenhower.”’

“Yet, while the President’s
overall job performance rating
has been ona slide, three in four
Americans continue to express
approval of President Reagan
aS a person,’ said Gallup.
Gallup, 50, is the president of
the Gallup Poll, founded in 1935
by his father.

Gallup’s surveys show that
Reagan is ‘“‘less popular with
non-whites than any president
in the last half century.’’ While
55 percent of whites polled ex-
pressed approval of Reagan’s

job-handling, only 12 percent of
non-whites do.

“Growing pessimism’’ over
Reagan’s economic program
has been a key factor in his
popularity’s downward trend.
Gallup said Reagan's approval
rating has lost 19 percent since
May of last year. Despite
decreasing popularity,

concentrates power in state in-
stead of federal agencies.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

 

Delayed Rush

On Tuesday night, the Interfraternity Council
brought up the question of postponing rush from the
first four weeks of the school year to the beginning of
the second semester. The idea was raised by Assis-
tant Dean of Students Dan Murphy, who said that a
faculty member of the University Council had made
the same suggeston.

We believe this is a legitimate question that needs
to be studied in detail by a committee. We hope that
the IFC will have the wisdom to select a committee
comprised of both fraternity members and freshmen
and non-fraternity members to study the question.

When the idea of a delayed rush was discussed at
Tuesday night’s meeting, most of the attending house
representatives immediately balked at the offer. Only
the speech of a dorm counselor, who claimed that
some freshmen didn’t like the current rush process,
kept the talk alive. This seems to indicate that a
variety of students, not a small clique, could best ex-
amine this matter.

Delaying rush is a topic that cannot be handled with
a simple vote. A committee study would provide in-
sight to a question that could ultimately rearrange
much of this school’s social structure.

We believe the IFC is on the correct route so far.
Hopefully the route will end with an impartial and
trenchant study of the question.

The following article was
reprinted from the Nov. 18 issue
of “The Guardsman,” the campus
newspaper of the City College of

_ San Francisco.

All Saturday classes for
Spring Semester will be cancell-
ed.

The economy cutbacks which
hover over the nation like a
giant insect, sets the first of its
many legs down here at City
College with the removal of 74
Saturday classes from _ the
Spring Semester. The crunch,
which will be felt by 2300
students, came only after
‘“‘serious discussion and
deliberation,” says Dean War-
ren White of the Evening Divi-
sion.

The reduction in the number
of classes on Saturday will save
$55,000 in an attempt to stay
within the budget for the fiscal
year 81-82. Dean White says,
‘‘People don’t like their lives in-
terfered with.’’ But students
now enrolled in Saturday
classes will have to reschedule
for their Spring evening
classes. Saturday classes are
attended mainly by working
people who for various reasons
have a hard time making it to
class during the week.

By removing the Saturday
classes Dean White states, ‘‘It’s
the least disruptive way to stay
within the budget. The state
allows for only a two-percent
growth, and City College has
shown a three-percent growth.
At present, all the buildings on

classes. This brings in overtime
for janitors, maintenance peo-
ple and 74 part-time teachers.
After January, only the library

and the computer center will be
open on Saturday, for it is felt
that they are for all the students
all the time and should there-
fore be available to them.”

Students’ House Burns

by Tom Baker

A house that was being rented
by three Washington and Lee
University students burned to
the ground early in the morning
of Dec. 27.

The house, owned by William
Meocham, and rented by Jay
Irons, Alex McAlister and Ware
Palmer, was on Va. Rte. 624.

Fire Department Chief Payne
Poindexter, who described the
fire as ‘“‘a total loss,” said the
house was unoccupied at the
time because the students were

away on Christmas break.

The fire required the efforts
of both the Kerrs Creek
Volunteer Fire Department and
the Lexington-Rockbridge Fire
Department to extinguish.

The state arson investigation
is still trying to determine the
origin of the fire.

According to Palmer, the
three students have already
found another house to live in
and are currently waiting for
money from their insurance to
pay for their destroyed goods.

Univ. Services Moves

by Greg Coy

The office of University Ser-
vices at W&L is moving to the
first floor of Graham-Lees Dor-
mitory by March 1.

The office is currently located
in Washington Hall. The new
location will be what was
formerly a television room on
the east side of the dormitory,
which is currently being
renovated and should be in
operation for the fall semester
of 1982.

University Services is being

crowded out of Washington Hall
by the Treasurer’s office, which
has shared the same area in the
past. University Treasurer
Stewart Epley is planning to in-
stall computer terminals in the

office for administrative
assistance.
Although the office is

spacious enough to accomodate
three administrators and two
secretaries, the terminals have
Squeezed out the University
Services’ staff.

 

 
IFC Discusses. Delayed Rush

by Steve Perry

Assistant Dean of Students
Dan Murphy asked fraternity
representatives at Tuesday
night’s Interfraternity Council
meeting to consider the possi-
bility of delaying rush to the se-
cond semester of the academic
year. Rush is currently held in
the first four weeks of the school
year.

Murphy stated that freshmen
might benefit from the chnage
in several ways. Murphy said
incoming students would be
able to ‘‘get their feet on the
ground”’ before the hectic rush
period began. Murphy added
that a delayed rush might give
freshmen an accurate picture of
fraternity life.

Dave Moore of Kappa Alpha
stated that rush would, in all
probability, continue regard-

less of the rule on an informal
basis. Lou Close of Delta Tau
Delta added that the rule
change would pose a greater
financial burden on the frater-
nities because the dues normal-
ly paid in the fall by pledges
would have to be paid by the
brothers.

Todd Smith, a dorm coun-
selor, came out in favor of a
rules change. Smith cited
several instances in which he,
as a dorm counselor, was con-
fronted by freshmen who were
disatisfied by the choices they
had made or felt cheated, in
general, by the rush process.
Smith also suggested that a
committee be organized to ex-
amine the feasibility of a rules
change.

In other business, the IFC
discussed its role in the upcom-

ing Muscular Dystrohy Dance-
athon. In the past, W&L frater-
nities have each donated two
kegs of beer to the dance. Tripp
Brower, Danceathon  Chair-
man, suggested that each
fraternity determine the size of
its donation. Fraternities were
also encouraged to plan their
social calendars around the
event.

Sigma Phi Epsilon was the
only house to appear before the
IFC’s judicial board. SPE was
charged with a noise violation
at 2:30 a.m. of Dec. 6. The
fraternitiy did not contest the
citation while before the board
and was given two weeks of
social probation.

IFC President Hall Vetterlein
stated that further discussion of
the possibility of a delayed rush
will occur at the next meeting.

Student Invents New Pack

A unique book and gear pack
invented by a W&L student is
being sold here by the inven-
tor’s younger brother.
Freshman Cameron Adams
says the Rapsack Pack allows
people to carry more books or
equipment with a minimum
amount of effort.

The pack, which comes in two
models, was invented by Bryan
Adams, who dropped out of
W&L as a junior to pursue its
development. The pack folds
out into a_ flattened. table
capable of holding significant
amounts of books or gear. The
pack folds around the waist,
fastened in front, supporting the
gear from the outside and
allowing the arms more free-
dom of movement. The pack
was developed with skiers,
bikers, skaters, hikers, runners

and students in mind.

Other advantages of the pro-
duct are that the cargo stays
organized, does not bang
together, and the load does not
shift to knock the owner off
balance. The pack is positioned
to integrate the cargo’s weight
with the owner, making it
easier to carry.

The younger Adams says his
brother still hopes to sell the
company to a larger company
or entrepeneur and return to
school. The Rapsack Pack has
been reveiwed by several
marketing firms with favorable
reports, according to Adams.
Bryan Adams’ business, Rabbit
Transit, is located Char-
lottesville and the packs are
manufactured in Roanoke.

The two models of the pack

Area Hit By Break-ins

by Tom Baker

The Washington and Lee com:
munity was plagued by a rash
of break-ins over the recent
two-week break.

The Beta Theta Pi fraternity,
the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity,
the College Inn, and several stu-
dent houses were all broken into

According to Lexington
Police Chief James A. Kirby,
the Beta Theta Pi house was
broken into on approximately
Dec. 29. Kirby said the in-
truders entered the house
through a bathroom window on
the third floor. Rodney Taylor,
a member of that fraternity,
said that six rooms had been
broken into and several posses-
sions, including a stereo, watch-
es, albums, cash and clothes,
had been taken from the rooms.

Eleven rooms were broken in-

Five rooms were broken into

The Washington and Lee
Biology department was named
as principle benefactor by the
will of its late professor, Gary
H. Dobbs III.

The popular professor shot
and killed himself on the morn-
ing of Dec. 31, leaving a letter to
the president of the university
citing his dissatisfaction with
his personal and professional
achievement.

The value of Dobbs’ estate
will not be tallied for four to six
weeks, according to university
attorney Eric Sisler.

Bequeathing his hunting and
fishing equipment to friends
and his collection of American
coins to the Indian Springs
School, Dobbs stipulated in his
will that the remainder of his
estate be sold and placed in a
special fund.

Dobbs directed the Biology
department to use this fund for
the purchase of 15 pieces of
equipment listed in the will. The
items include a centrifuge, a
computing densitometer and an
eight-passenger Ford van for
field trips.

Sisler said that these pur-
chases cannot be made until the
estate is settled and the taxes
paid. He said that this could

 

Dobbs’ Will Detailed

take up to a year. The Biology
department would then have
three years in which it must buy
the equipment.

The list of 15 items is very
carefully detailed with brand
names and serial numbers.
Dobbs had his will dated and

witnessed on Dec. 17, 1981.

In the will, Dobbs directed
that his body be cremated and
scattered on the front campus.
He forbade the university from
making public statements or
holding a memorial service.

In the will, Dobbs wrote, ‘‘I
have profound gratitude toward
my alma mater, Washington
and Lee University, a devotion

_ to its highest ideals, and a deep

affection for my teachers, col-
leagues, students, and friends
there.

Blood Drive To Begin Here

by Bill Woolfolk

If you haven’t seen the
posters yet, look again: the Red
Cross is going to hold another
Blood Drive at W&L. If you
have already decided not to par-
ticipate or if you are still
undecided, the following infor-
mation may provide a new in-
sight into the Red Cross Blood
Program.

The Red Cross was first
licensed by the federal govern-
ment to collect blood after
World War II. This licensing re-
quires only two things of the
Red Cross: that they supply
free blood to all askers if they
have it on hand and that they
supply all types of aid to
military families that require
it.

Many advancements have
been made since the war in the
storage and processing of blood.
Maximum storage life of a unit
of blood is now 35 days and Red
Cross blood supplies are used in
everything from cancer radia-

tion treatment to helping

Blood is needed in greater
quantities in surgery to pro-
mote healing and is used at all
hours of the day and night to
save the lives of accident vic-
tims. Blood has so many ap-
plications today that its collec-
tion, processing and storage has
become the main service of the
United States Red Cross.

What is done with the blood
that is collected? The Red Cross
subjects every drop to 11 dif-
ferent tests, checking for Rh
factors, blood type and abnor-
malities in the constituent
elements of the blood. The blood
is then supplied to hospitals
which are part of the Red Cross
system. If there is a surplus of
blood the Red Cross supplies
hospitals that are not part of the
system and sometimes sends
blood to other countries in need.

Suitable for 3-4 students, $125 per student. 1 year
lease, utilities not included. Security deposit re-

surpluses are hard to predict, a
continual collection system
must be in effect at all times.

How much blood does the Red
Cross collect? Last year the
Red Cross collected 1,953 units
in Rockbridge County alone. In
the Appalachian region, of
which Rockbridge County is a
part, the total was 51,105 units.
Nationally, the Red Cross
received 5,629,477 units. Only
1.3 percent of that total was not
used due to the presence of
diseases and abnormalities in
the blood.

Still it is not enough.

Stop and think; probably
someone you know has had
surgery requiring large
amounts of blood. If they did,
more than likely the blood they
received was due to the efforts
of the American Red Cross. It
all boils down to saving people:
strangers, friends, family,
maybe even you.

Please, give.

The Voice Of The Generals

By John Cleghorn

Ken Ries sat in his office late
Tueeday afternoon buried in
thought. This particular time he
was working on the spring
sports poster. Another time it
could have been a program for
that night’s basketball game or
a Statistical analysis of the foot-
ball team. Whatever it has to do
with W&L sports, he has likely
designed it, written it, compiled
it, or just stored it away for
future purposes. Ken Ries
humbly summarizes his job as
Washington and Lee Sports In-
formation Director as stories,
Stats, publications, and repor-
ting, but it goes a lot further
than that.

The university puts a lot of
faith in the young,’’ remarks
Ries, now in his fourth year as
S.1.D. After working in the
sports information office and
completing his work at Furman
University Ries was hired by
W&L only a month after his
graduation. Although the drop
from a Division One school toa

’ Division Three school may not

be an ideal one for an S.I.D.,
Ken Ries is more than satisfied.

“W&L is among the top in
academics and athletics,” says
Ries,’ | am not talking about
wins and losses, but about the
athletics and the commitment
by the university to the student-
athlete.”

In his first year at W&L, Ries
worked to gain a grasp of the
university sports. ‘‘I knew how
to do the job, but realizing the
needs of each sport was the first

thing I had to do,”’ Ries com-
ments, ‘‘What’s best is the con-
tinuity.”’

“The university has always
done the best they can for
ahtletes. It’s a nice picture.”’

Is it any different covering an
all male sports program after
Furman? “There is no dif-
ference when it comes down to
it,” says Ries. ‘‘Coaches will
always have X number of
players and X number of
games. A coach is somewhat
sheltered, the tasks for which
he works don’t change.”

In his two and years at
Washington and Lee there has
been only one head coaching
change and Ken Ries admits
that has made his job “a lot
smoother.’’ But in his close in-
volvement with W&L athletics
Ries ‘has noticed one change
and that is a higher intensity in
the approach towards recruit-
ing. ‘There has really been an
increase in the number of
brochures used by the coaches
in recruiting,’’ remarks Ken,
“the race is really getting
faster. The coaches are having
to spend a lot more time to get
the student athlete.”

The job of a Sports Informa-
tion Director is largely to
publicize each event and team,
but at W&L where the atten-
dance is lower than average,
that job is not'an easy one.

“Say you're from Califor-
nia,”’ explains Ries, ‘‘and W&L
is playing Lynchburg. You don’t
know diddly. It’s hard to get in-
terested. Some might say that’s

my job, maybe so, but if  in-
terest in the sport is not there its
hard to cultivate. I can give you
stickers, posters, and brochures
but its not necessarily going to
get you there.”’

‘‘Another thing is that people
won't go to see their friends,”
continues Ries, ‘‘even when
people know individuals that
are playing they won’t go. You
rarely see fraternities out there
backing their brothers. It’s fun-
ny, W&L has the best athletic
program in the conference but
I’m not sure whether everybody
takes good advantage of it
—whether to play or to watch.”’

In may ways Ken Ries
recognizes the large gap be-
tween athletics and the student
body at Washington and Lee. To
play a sport at W&L takes a lot
of dedication, which it should,
but is not rewarded by fan sup-
port. That is the tragedy.

“If you're gonna like sports,”’
says Ken Ries, ‘‘this is a good
place to like them.”

When the Washington & Lee
University swim team jumps
back into action this weekend
after taking a month-long break
from competition, the Generals
will be facing two of the more
powerful teams in the region.

On Friday evening, Jan. 15
the Generals will battle James
Madison University at 7 in the
VMI pool. On Saturday the 16th
W&L will entertain Towson
State University at 2 p.m. in the
Cy Twombly Pool.

‘‘January is not a time to rest,
so we've arranged for top-notch
competition to give us the
challenges we need,” explains
third-year head coach Page
Remillard, whose team will
also swim two dual meets dur-
ing each of the following two
weekends. ‘‘By the time we face
Madison and Towson we'll have
20 days of intense training
under our belts. We’ll be ready
to see what we can do.”

W&L and Madison both par-
ticipated in the Virginia State
Championship meet held in ear-
ly December at the W&L pool,
Madison taking a third-place
finish in the eight-team field
and W&L a fifth-place showing.
“JMU’s program is on the
upswing. Head coach Charlie
Arnold has done some good
recruiting and hired a fine
assistant. The Dukes are a good

 

Swimmers To
Resume Action

model for us because I feel that
we're at the point they were two
years ago. I hope we continue to
follow their lead,’’ comments
Remillard.

Towson State, meanwhile, is
equally if not more impressive.
The Tigers posted a 12-0 dual
meet record last winter in-
cluding a sound decision over
WA&L. ‘‘And they are undefeated
again this season,” informs
Remillard, who points to sud-
den recruiting success as the
basis for Towson’s strength.

Turning to the Generals,
Remillard and newly-acquired
assistant David Kent hope they
emerge from these three week-
ends of dual meet competition
at 3-3. “If we can do that, we'll
be right on schedule with our
goals, one of which is to get a
winning dual meet record,’’ of-
fers the head coach. W&L cur-
rently stands 1-0, the win com-
ing over VMI in November.

W&L SWIM TEAM
SCHEDULE CHANGES: One
meet has been added, one
dropped from the Generals’
current schedule. On Friday,
Jan. 29, W&L will be host to
Shippensburg State at 7 p.m. in
the Cy Twombly Pool. The Feb-
ruary 5 meet against Davidson
College has been cancelled at
Davidson’s request.

 

Prior to last Tuesday night’s
match, W&L leads the series
with Hampden-Sydney, which
dates back to 1964, 18-13. This
tight series has always produc-

. ed close ball games. Nine of the

matches have been within three
points .

In the last issue of the Phi it
was noted that the Washington
and Lee lacrosse team debuted
in 1977, which is obviously in-
correct. The lacrosse team
opened in 1940 while the water
polo team played its first games
in 1977.

Cavalline Hopes To
RecoverFor Baseball

by Rick Swagler

Chris Cavalline, tailback for
the W&L football team and
Shortstop for the baseball team,
-is in the process of recovering
from an injury sustained in the
last football game of the season.
Cavalline said that he ‘‘didn’t
know how it happened. I didn’t
get hit or anything.”’

The injury is known as the
anterior compartment syn-
drome and is similar to a blood
clot. The injury leaves the foot
disfunctional and requires ap-
proximately four months
recovery time.

Cavalline’s future for the
W&L baseball team is uncer-
tain. Cavalline has been exer-
cising the leg and naturally
hopes the leg will be fully
operable by the time the season
begins. As for the 1982 football
season, Cavalline is positive he
will be 100-percent for the
season’s opener.

As unfortunate as the injury
may have been, it is fortunate
that it did not interfere with
Cavalline’s athletics any more
than it has. As he puts it, ‘‘it was
just one of those freak things.”

Cagers Win Sixth Straight

by G. Bruge Potter

One of the time-honored
dogmas of basketball is that a
good team must be able to shoot
well from the foul line. But don’t
tell that to the Washington and
Lee roundball squad — they
already know.

The Generals’ last three op-
ponents, Bethany and Haver-
ford in the W&L Invitational
and Hampden-Sydney College
on Tuesday night, all outscored
W&L from the floor. But Verne
Canfield’s team hit 81.1% of its
free throws in those games
compared to its opponents’
64.2% en route to improving its
record to 6-3 and evening its
ODAC mark at 1-1 with the 63-56
victory over the archrival
Tigers at the Warner Center.
The Generals had downed
Bethany 73-65 and Haverford
68-51 over the weekend to cap-
ture the Invitational title for the
seventh time in the last 13
years.

H-SC took an early lead
against the Generals, but
George Spears’ jumper with
3:19 left in the half gave W&L
their first lead at 19-18. Spears,
who led all scorers with 20
points, connected on two free
throws, and John Lee Graves,
who scored 11 points and pulled

down nine rebounds, hit a
jumper from the right corner at
the halftime buzzer as’ W&L
took a 23-18 lead into the locker
room at the half.

Three minutes into the second
half, it was a brand new
ballgame as the Tigers cut the
Generals’ lead to one, 28-27, on a
three-point play. Two more foul
shots by Spears, who finished
with 14, and a three-point play
by Ken Jaffe put the Generals
up 35-32.

Spears and Brian Hanson
then scored four points each to
spark an 11-2 scoring spree that
gave the squad its biggest lead
at 47-34 with 7:07 remaining.
But hold everything. H-SC
erupted for an 8-1 spree of their
own, and when W&L took a
timeout with 5:57 left, they were
only up by eight, 48-40, setting
the stage, apparently, for an ex-
citing finish.

But that was not to be as the
teams spent the final five
minutes fouling at both ends of
the floor. W&L hit nine of ten
shots from the stripe in that
span and the closest the Tigers
came was within four at 54-50
with 1:59 left in the game.

Sophomore guard Chris
Baldwin had the ball stolen
from him on the Generals next

 
  
  

possession, but the Hampden-
Sydney player was tied up and
the ball went to W&L on the new
alternate possession rule. H-SC
proceded to steal the ball again,
but a Tiger stepped out of
bounds and Spears’ jumper
with 1:17 -remaining iced the
game. Jaffe, who scored a
career high 11 points, brought
the crowd to its feet with a steal
and a drive down the length of
the floor for an uncontested
layup as time expired.

Washington and Lee only shot
48.4% from the floor, but hit 33
of 45 free throw attempts
(73.3%) to H-SC’s 45.4%. The
Generals committed 24 per-
sonal fouls to the Tigers’ 30.

For the first time in his
coaching career, Canfield
started a small, three-guard
lineup against Haverford in the
final of the W&L Invitational on
Saturday night. And it worked,
as the team scored ten straight
points midway through the se-
cond half to come from a 14-8
deficit to take an 18-14 lead.

The rest was history as the
Generals continued to build on
their lead, took the biggest lead
of the game at 58-40 with 5:49
left, and walked away with a
68-51 win. Haverford came into
the tourney with the top defense

To Ga. Tech

by John Harrison
The Washington and Lee
wrestling team will reach what
the team captain calls ‘‘the
peak of our season as far as
competition goes’ this Satur-
day when it takes part in the
Georgia Tech Invitational in
Atlanta. In addition to the host
school, competition will be pro-
vided by Duke, V.M.I., Ten-
nessee Tech, Jacksonville State
(Ala.), Ohio Northwestern, and

Pembroke State (N.C.).

“It’s no secret we'll face
some big guns in Atlanta,”’ of-
fers ninth-year W&L_ head

Ohio Northern will be the only
NCAA Division III members in
the Invitational. “Our em-
phasis, clearly, will be on in-
dividual performances. We
hope to have several of our

wrestlers pick up wins.”’

The Generals had trouble last
week at Cambell College
matching weights. Freshman
Ron Thornton, who would nor-
mally compete in the 126-pound
division, was forced into the 134
category. Freshman Joe
O'Neill (34-12) and Carlton
Peebles (34-11) were the only
Generals able to score at all
against the Camels. The situa-
tion improved slightly Saturday
at Duke, with everyone manag-
ing to score and Thornton pull-
ing out a 6-5 decision.

“They were the two toughest
teams we will face this year,”
said Valliere, ‘‘and showed it.’
Jeff Dixon and Joe O'Neill did
pretty well. They just happened
to match up against two tough
guys. Carlton was in the same
position.”

Review:

An Overrated Meryl Streep

by Michael Judge

Director Karl Reizs’  in-
telligent and magnificently
visualized, but ultimately

disappointing, screen adapta-
tion of The French Lieutenant’s
Woman develops as an ex-
amination of the past as a con-
stant metaphor for the present,
and as a thoughtful exploration
of the timeless and enigmatic
qualities of love between the
sexes. By its conclusion,
however, the film has replaced
these, its vital and compelling
thematic aspects, with an all-
too familiar dose of feminist
rhetoric.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman is based on John
Fowles’ 1968 novel of the same
name. In the novel, Fowles
combines a modern narrative
technique with 20th century
hindsight to tell a Victorian love
story, departing from his nar-
rative at times to refer to
modern developments in
science and medicine, and to
such 20th century figures as
Freud and Henny Moore.
Fowles uses these references to
comment upon, and give a
deeper clarity of meaning to,

Sarah,

his Victorian plot and_ its
characters; calling upon the
present to illuminate the past
and, adversely, creating in the
reader a haunting sensation of
the past continuously influenc-
ing the present which grew
from it.

The film tries to duplicate this
element of hindsight by presen-
ting two simultaneous plots —
one Victorian, one modern —
through the device of a film
within a film: Meryl Streep, in

her most overrated perfor-:

mance to date, plays both
the mysterious and
romantically tragic heroine of
the novel, and Anna, the
American actress who is por-
traying her in a film version of
the book. Similarly, Jeremy
Irons brilliantly plays both
Charles, the hero of the Vic-
torian story, and Mike, the
modern British actor who plays
him on the screen.

This technique of juxtaposing
two interdependent plots in one
film, though hardly new to The
French Lieutenant’s Woman, is
developed in it with surprising
sophistication and __ lucidity;
from the opening shot the inten-

tions of the film are made clear.
We see Streep, dressed in
costume as Sarah, standing
before a hand-held mirror as
the last dabs of makeup are
placed on her face. The long
black cloak that she wears and
the drooping hood that frames
her face mark her as a woman
from another century. Sudden-
ly, with a loud snap, a clapper
board intrudes into the frame,

. announcing the commencement

of another days shooting. With
this explanatory — and highly
effective — union of images the
film begins.

Streep’s Sarah is a woman op-
pressed by the harsh moral
strictures of her day; she has
been degraded in the eyes of her
provincial society by an earlier
affair with a French lieutenant,
who has deserted her. Yet she
clings to her individuality and
to the memory of her vanished
love with mournful dignity.
Every day she stands at the end
of a long, snake-like jetty,
draped in black like a figure
from a Dore engraving, waiting
for her lover’s return. It is here
that Charles, a young well-to-do
Englishman, first lays eyes on
Sarah while walking with his
fiancee — and from this mo-

Ousmane Sembene is con-
sidered the father of African
cinema. Born in Senegal on the
West Coast of Africa when the
country was still a French col-
ony, Sembene took up residence
in France when he fought in the
French armed forces. There,
after teaching himself to read
and write French, Sembene
began to write novels. In 1960,
when he was nearly forty, he
turned to filmmaking, studied
in Russia, and then returned to
Africa.

Xala (pronounced ‘‘ha-la’’) is
Sembene’s fourth feature film.
It was censored in his own coun-

try because it forsook the stand-
ard targets of satire constituted
by European exploitation and
racism to concentrate instead
on black African society. The
complete and uncut version
which we will screen satirizes
supposed African independence
from white colonial policies and
technology.

Filmed, the credits say, with
“the participation of the beg-
gars of Dakar, Xala shows
Senegalese life to be an uneasy
mixture of tribal superstitions
and white status symbols. A
white Mercedes, mineral water,
air-conditioning, and Coca Cola
figure prominently in this
movie by a director one critic
has called the African Moliere.
The hero is a half-Westernized
black businessman, just elected
the newly all-African
Chamber of Commerce and
about to marry a third wife,
who finds himself on his wed-
ding night suddenly struck
down by the ‘‘xala,” the curse
of impotence.

Review

ment on theirelives become in-
extricably intertwined.

As the film develops its main
theme comes to center on the
fascination and, finally,
obsessive love that Charles
comes to feel for the mysterious
and tragic Sarah; and on the
similar obsession that Mike
develops for his co-star, Anna
—and, through her, for the fic-
tional Sarah.

This love ends for both
Charles and Mike, in pain and
betrayal, but towards the end of
the film these concerns, so
strongly developed by Reisz
during the course of the film,
cease to be of primary impor-
tance. Instead, the motivations
behind Sarah’s—Anna’s
behavior take center stage, and
both characters emerge as
symbolic manifestations of the
right of woman to assert her
individuality — to seek her own
space, as the nauseating
Californiaism goes — regard-
less of the age or society in
which she lives; and here the
film loses its subtlety and sen-
sitivity.

It is entirely possible that

 

Reisz could have made this
statement while keeping true to
the much more poignant and
timeless elements of the rest of
the film. He has chosen, how-
ever, not to do so, and what we
have by the film’s conclusion is
an unsatisfying assertion of
women’s rights throughout the
ages.

Yet for those who love precise
and beautifully — realized
historical film-making, The
French Lieutenant’s Woman is
much worth seeing — as an
evocation of Victorian England
it is masterly. The rich green
lushness of the English coun-
tryside; the solemn granite ma-
jesty of the coasts; the despair-
ful urban squalor of 19th cen-
tury London, and the deep red
velvet interiors of the clubs and
homes which sought to shut it
out — these images are brought
to the screen with stunningly
rich photography and superb at-
tention to detail. The French
Lieutenant’s Woman presents a
feast for the eyes, but, after
some intriguing progress, an
unfortunate scarcity of fare for
the mind.

in Division III, but the W&L ex-
ploited it by defense. No, that’s
not a typo, defense. According
to Canfield, the Generals tired
the Fords with defensive
pressure, which made Haver-
ford less effective at the other
end of the floor. ‘‘It was our best
defensive effort of the season,”’
he said. ‘‘We were able to play
our three offensive sets with
much more effectiveness.”

Canfield rotated his five
guards effectively so that he
always had a fresh set. Spears
led the guards with 13 points,
and Billy Yates had 9, Jaffe 8,
Henry Bond 6 and Chris
Baldwin 2. “‘Our depth is devel-
oping. There is a certain har-
mony with each guy knowing
his role and fulfilling it,’’ said
Canfield.

Graves led the Generals with
26 points and Hanson pulled
down 12 rebounds. Both players
were named to the all-tour-
nament team.

the Bistos made one more field

Well, yes, but they took ten

Not a lot of practice time is

said Canfield. He says their
outstanding percentage in that
area ‘‘is a credit to the kids and
their concentration.”

The Generals also received a
boost when sophomore guard
Henry Bond was allowed to
return to school after an error
was discovered in his trans-
cript. He was used sparingly
against Bethany but scored six
points against Haverford and

planning to attend to purchase
the $25 tickets well in advance.
Although tickets will be sold at
the door for $30, the SAB is anx-
ious to have some approxima-
tion as to the number of people
who will be attending the ball.

The SAB is “going out on.a
limb,”’ stated Martin and, with
good reason, is understandably
‘‘apprehensive.”

With $55,000 in question, the
SAB is dependent upon: con-
siderable support in order to re-
tain sufficient funds for its re-
maining budget, funds which
will be aimed towards SAB
sponsored events this Spring.

Asked what difficulties, if
any, may arise from situating
Fancy Dress in the gymnasium,
Associate Athletic Director
Dick Miller stated that he did
not ‘foresee any problems.”’
Miller added that there may be
‘some inconvenience in
rescheduling classes’’ but,
other than that, had ‘re objec-

Works

Mr. and Mrs. Joseph C. Hor-
rell of Lexington have given an
important collection of 18th and
19th century English literature
to the Washington and Lee
University Library. The 178-
volume collection includes a
series of early biographies of
Jonathan Swift and a valuable
first edition of Swift’s
‘‘Gulliver’s Travels.”

“The Horrell Collection is
particularly significant because
it does put together a number of
18th Century biographies of
Swift and works about his
associates, including Alexander
Pope,’’ explained Richard W.
Oram, reference and public ser-
vices librarian for the Universi-
ty Library. Horrell collected the
books while he was pursuing his
B.A. and M-Litt. degrees at
Cambridge University. His
special field of interest was
Swift, whose poems he edited
for the Muses’ Library in 1958.

Mr. and Mrs. Horrell moved
to Lexington in 1976. They had
previously lived in Maryland
where Horrell was employed by
Vitro Laboratories while Mrs.
Horrell taught English for eight
years at the University of

According to Miller, ‘‘a
several thousand dollar mat”
intended to cover the gym’s
floor was specially purchased
by thé University in order to in-
sure protection for the dance
floor. Dean Lewis John, who
was involved in the decision to
buy the floor apparatus, justi-
fied the amount apportioned for
the mat, stating that the mat
will be used for other large
future gatherings held in the
sym.

Although some may protest
that tradition has been broken
in relocating Fancy Dress from
the Student Center to the
Warner Gymnasium, the SAB
asserts that those who attend
can expect the same quality
decorations. as have been
displayed in the past. The entire
two upper levels of the gym-
nasium shall be transformed,
giving the appearance that one
is not actually in an athletic
facility. In addition, profes-

sionals have been hired to con-
tend with various lighting
technicalities and several types
of imported beer will be on tap.

Entertainment in the new
gym will include, appropriate-
ly, ‘‘W&L’s most popular swing
band,’’ Lester Lanin, who per-
formed at the 50th annual Fan-
cy Dress Ball. Appearing in the
auxilary gym will be a top-
named band to be announced at
a later date. Several other
premium bands will be station-
ed in the fifth level projection
rooms. Commented U.C. chair-
man Bob Schmidt on the 75th
anniversary of Fancy Dress,
‘we want it to stick in people’s
minds as an_ extraordinary
event.”

Extremely tight security will
be enforced at all times
throughout the evening. The
doors open at 7:30 p.m. on Fri-
day, March 5 to inaugurate the
ball, and the bands will begin
playing at8p.m.

Gallup

(continued from page 1 )

Survey respondents feel that
state governments are more ef-
ficient, more understanding of
the people’s needs and more
likely to make decisions free of
political corruption, Gallup
said. This is an almost complete
reversal since 1936, when 56
percent favored concentration
of power in the federal govern-
ment. According to Gallup, 64
percent now prefer the state
governments.

Another trend Gallup noted
was the rise of support among
Americans for a third party.

Morgan Griffith, senior law
rep., was under the impression
that the E.C. could only advise,

 

said ‘‘it is always desirable for -

but not dictate, how a club could
spend their money. Ken Lang,
’82 rep., expressed concern that
other clubs will come before the
E.C. requesting money for
transportation.

Myers added “Next year,
there will be more budget re-
quests for transportation.”

There is no need to worry
about that, stated Ben Hale, ’84
rep. “The E.C. can always cut
the transportation requests.”

Hale said, “It’s the clubs’
responsibility to manage their
funds.’’ He then moved that the
International Club be allowed to
use its funds as it sees fit.

The motion passed 10-1. Lang
opposed the motion.

Mike Gregory reported that
the Outing Club has four ski
trips planned for the month.
The first one is scheduled for
Jan. 14 at Wintergreen. The
club will also be going caving
Jan. 17 with Sweetbriar College.
Gregory added that once a per-
son signs up for a ski trip, he is
committed to pay for it.

Dave Hepler, captain of the
Fencing team, reported that the
first meet will be with Navy on
Jan. 16. The club’s only expense
was the purchase of a scoring
machine.

_ Observing that the “horse-

social value,’’ he denied that

The Washington and Lee

Marathon, to be held Jan. 29-30
in Evans Dining Hall, is shaping |
up as an event encompassing
both the W&L and Rockbridge
County communities.

Tripp Brower, Superdance ’82
Chairman, stressed that he is
“trying to provide ‘‘anyone who
wants to get involved a chance
to get involved.”’ Brower added
that “to participate is quite a
committment but something
anyone would benefit from.”

Brower expects as,many as
200 people to dance and has set
the dance’s goal at an earning

‘of $22,000. The entire event, |

described by Brower as

“W&L’s longest party,”’ will in-
clude six live bands, three tape
shows and numerous special
events for both the dancers and
the spectators.

Adding 2 Members
Considered By EC

by Ben Jarratt

A proposal to add two new
members to the Executive
Committee was introduced at
Monday night’s meeting.

“The additional members
would allow for equal represen-
tation,” stated Morgan Griffith,
Senior Law Rep. “It would also
insure the fairness of the honor
system and the possibility of
pre-trial prejudice by members
of the E.C.””

Griffith added that the
changes were ‘‘a recommenda-
tion from last year’s E.C, to this
year’s body.”’

Amendments would be need-
ed for both the Student Body
Constitution and the White
Book. The governing function of
the E.C. will not change, while
the honor system functions will
change slightly.

Presently, the E.C. consists of
12 members. During honor
trials, two members of the E.C.
and a third chosen from the stu-
dent body form an investigating
committee that looks into possi-
ble violations. The two E.C.
members may also serve on the
honor hearings of cases they
have investigated.

“The major effect is to have
the investigative members not

- serve on the hearings,”’ Griffith

stated. ‘‘There may be some
prejudice by E.C. members
who sit in on both investigations
and then hearings.’’

Griffith proposed that addi-
tional representatives be

. chosen from the freshmen class

and the second year law class.

‘This would allow more equal

representation of the student

body.

E.C. President Eric Myers
thought the committee should

devote some time to this issue.

Elections and amendments
would not be held until the Spr-
ing term.

Ben Hale, ’84 Rep., motioned
that the proposals be tabled un-

til next ta: S meeting. This
would give members a chance
to consider the matter. The mo-
tion passed, 11-0, with Tripp
Brower having left the meeting
earlier.

Hale suggested the possibility
of splitting the E.C. into two
bodies — an honor board and an
administrative board. Frank’
Smith ’83 Rep., said he would
like to study this idea with Hale.

The E.C. spent almost an
hour debating its involvement
in having a deferred fraternity
rush at W&L. The issue has
already been raised by the In-
terfraternity Council. Smith

wanted to know about possible
E.C. involvement in this area.

 

Morgan Griffith

John Vlahoplus, ’83 Rep.,
stated that deferred rush is an
area that E.C. ought to address.
“It is an issue that affects the
student body,” said Vlahoplus,
Ken Lang, ’82 Rep., said defer-
red rush was a fraternity mat-
ter. ‘‘Let the IFC work on it,”
stated Lang. “The E.C. cannot
tell the IFC how to conduct
rush.”’

“You are missing the point,”
said President Eric Myers.
‘‘What we want to do is discuss
the issue.’”” Hale commented
that ‘‘although rush affects in-
dependents, it is a fraternity
matter. But any issue that af-
fects the student body can be
discussed by this body.”’

around 70 years. It goes without saying, we believe,
that Mr. Latture has given more than a lifetime of
devotion to this university. |

Mr. Latture serves as a reminder of tbe importance
of incorporating the past into the present. He is one of
the founders of Omicron Delta Kappa, a society that
has blossomed into a national organization. His desire
to create an organization promoting relations be-
tween students and the community has developed into
a nation-wide affair.

Congratulations again, Mr. Latture.

The EC And Rush

The Executive Committee discussed Rush at its last
meeting. Despite the fear of some members that the
Interfraternity Council might feel its turf had been
violated, the result was perhaps the E.C.’s most in-
teresting meeting of the year. |

Frank Smith, ’83 Rep., introduced a motion to talk
about the touchy subject of delaying Rush until either
the second month or second semester of the school
year. Smith has hardly been vocal or outspoken in his
E.C. career, but in broaching the topic he has done
what his fellow members would not do for more than a
semester.

The reason for delaying this discussion may have
been courtesy for the I.F.C., or it might have been
laziness. When the topic was discussed, however, it
became evident that most of the E.C. had been think-
ing about it and talking about it among themselves.
Perhaps this is why the E.C. finally said something
about delayed Rush. It is a question on the minds of
people both in and out of fraternities, and therefore
should be brought up in the most important forum
available on campus.

Some E.C. members doubted whether they had the
jurisdiction to be talking about Rush. If the E.C. is
looking for precedent, it need only look at the actions
of last year’s president, Bob Willis. It was Willis who,
upon hearing a rumor that a fraternity had slipped a
drug into a girl’s drink, took it upon himself to appear
before the I.F.C. Clearly, Bob Willis believed that
E.C. members could and should take note of fraterni-
ty matters.

Part of the charm of having an elected student
government is seeing those elected officials concern
themselves with all aspects of campus life. No less an
authority than the university catalogue states that the
E.C.’s role, besides maintaining the honor system, is
“monitoring all student-related campus activities.”

We praise the Frank Smith for having the insight to
raise the Rush question before the E.C. We only hope
that some of his constituents share his enthusiasm for
discussion. We are not asking the Executive Commit-
tee to come up with any answers, we only hope that it
remains open to such discussions.

Too many people on campus share the belief that
the E.C. exists only to “‘grill’’ people for honor viola-
tions. Intelligent discussions, such as Monday’s
debate about Rush, shows that the Executive Com-
mittee is fulfilling its role in the student government.

Curious About Delayed Rush

Dear Sir:

I was quite disappointed to
learn that the Arthur Miller is
not coming to Lexington, but
rather an Arthur Miller is to ap-
pear. Reviewing the Contact
schedule with this in mind,
leads me to question whether
quantity or quality provides the
best policy for the selection of
speakers at W&L. The present
year’s high point seems to be F.
Lee Bailey, last year’s was G.
Gordon Liddy. Granted, Bailey
is a step up from Liddy, but he
certainly is not of the caliber of
Arthur Miller or, for that mat-
ter, Tom Stoppard.

I do realize the high cost of
speakers. Yet I think one has to
consider the distinct possibility
that blowing all the money on
two major speakers of some
fame and interest, rather than
giving ‘the university a
smorgasbord of obscure foot-
notes, would reach more people
in the university community. I
am not calling for a speaker’s
list drawn from a popularity
poll, I am asking for speakers
with names that don’t have to
be explained.

I have some trouble with the
misunderstanding about Arthur
Miller. Could it be that the

members of Contact expected
people to automatically assume
the name to refer to a Harvard
Law professor? If this is the
case, perhaps we should have
some second thoughts as re-
gards their ability to discern
and select speakers for W&L.
Delayed Rush

While I’ve got the soapbox
out, I might as well put in my
two cents about delayed rush.
There are, as I see it, basically
two arguments against the pro-
posal. First, a delayed rush
would allow freshmen to
discover that fraternity life is
not like rush year-round, but is
in some ways better and in
others worse. I would not sug-
gest a system of no contact
before the delayed rush though.
The more contact the better.
It’s hard enough for frats to
keep up the hype-job during the
present rush period, it would be
next to impossible to do so into
February. The consolation is
that fraternities would be gain-
ing pledges who know more ex-
actly what they are getting into
(thus making better members,
one might assume) and pledges
whom the frats knew more
about. ;

The second argument against

a delayed rush is that the early
rush allows freshmen to get to
know more people quickly.
There are a number of points to
be raised against this. The pro-
bability of getting to know
anyone better at a typical frat
party must be next to nonexis-
tent. At schools without frats or
with delayed rushes, it cannot
be denied that, however inex-
plicable it may seem, students
do get to know one another. And
wouldn’t it be better to have
freshmen approach frats from a
position of already having
friends? Wouldn’t he find the
warm welcome at frat, during
rush, less seductive? Assuming
that frat life is a very positive
experience, and I have no

doubts that, for the most part, it

is (why else would so many
students remain in frats?), then
why would frats protest against
a system which would give the
freshmen a better opportunity
to see the subtler benefits of frat
life? To conclude, there is a
bonus which no one seems to
have noticed, that is an extend-
ed and thus less hectic party
schedule. If rush was not so
rushed, then maybe so many

people, both freshmen and frat

Students Find Cartoon Racist

Dear Sir

We are writing in protest of a
cartoon which was published in
Issue No. 13 of The Ring-tum
Phi. This cartoon depicted a
group of black entertainers be-
ing directed to the servants’ en-
trance of what appeared to be
Evans Dining Hall. The caption
read, WHADDYA MEAN
“SERVANTS’ ENTRANCE”?
WE THE BAND, MON... We
hope its intent was innocent, but
to us it implied an affirmation
of the old racist stereotype
which casts all Blacks in the
role of servants.

It may interest you to know
that there are students at W&L
who are black, and while we are
aware that our presence here is
neither recognized nor ap-
preciated by some of the
students and faculty here, we
think it behooves a supposedly
responsible campus organiza-
tion such as The Ring-tum Phi
to refrain from pandering to the
archaic misconceptions of these
bigots.

We found the cartoon and the
accompanying caption ex-
tremely offensive. Moreover,
we felt that it expressed a
thorough disregard for our sen-
sibilities.

The cartoon is not only in-
sulting, but also irresponsible.
In our view it has _ been
detrimental to the spirit of
detente and fellowship that we

' strive to perfect between the

races, A proper respect for each

 

other’s integrity in necessarily
of the utmost importance and
concern.

We, the undersigned, there-
fore respectfully submit that it

W&L Completes 10-Year, $67 Million Program

. Washington and Lee Univer-
sity announced that it has suc-
cessfully completed its 10-year
development program by rais-
ing $67-million, thereby sur-
passing the $62-million goal set
for last December 31.

The Washington and Lee pro-
gram is the largest successful
effort by a college or university
of its size. Washington and
Lee’s current enrollment is
1,650 and the university has
16,000 living alumni.

Robert E.R. Huntley,
Washington and Lee’s presi-
dent, made the announcement
at Tuesday’s Founders’ Day
ceremonies. ‘“‘The astounding
success of the program is a
mark of the vitality of this old
school and an unmistakable
sign of the loyalty and generosi-
ty of those who love her,”
Huntley said. ‘‘The largest fac-
tor in our achievement has been
the extraordinary role of our
board of trustees, which
throughout the years has never
flagged in its generous example
and its committed leadership.

‘“‘We who serve here on the
campus can properly regard
the achievement as a mandate
for continued pursuit of the
ideals of liberal education at
Washington and Lee. We cannot
regard our university as secure,
‘but we can regard it as strong
enough to approach the future
boldly and unafraid.”

The $67-million in gifts
represents $22.8 million in en-
dowment resources, $30.8
million for construction of new

facilities and renovation of ex-
isting facilities, and $13.4
million committed over the 10
years through the university’s
annual giving programs and by
other unrestricted gifts.

In addition to the $67-million
raised during the development
program, the university receiv-
ed an unrestricted bequest of
approximately $12-million from
the estate of the late John Lee
Pratt of Fredricksburg, Va., in
January 1976. In accordance
with the provisions of that be-
quest, the Pratt gift is being us-
ed by the university to improve
salaries and student scholar-
ship programs. It has played,
and will continue to play, a vital
role in allowing the university
to confront the eroding effects
of inflation.

Washington and Lee’s 10-year
fund-raising program was
chaired by the rectors, or
chairmen, of the university’s
board of trustees between 1972
and the present: John Newton
Thomas of Richmond, Va.
(1970-74), the late Ross L.
Malone (1974),
Nuckols Jr. of Weston, Vermont
(1974-1981), and James M.
Ballengee of Philadelphia, Pa.
(1981-present).

Joining the rectors — with
responsibility for planning and
executing the overall program
were the chairmen of the board
of trustees’ development com-
mittee: John M. Stemmons of
Dallas, Tex. (1972-1977), John
L. Crist Jr. of Charlotte, N.C.
(1977), and S.L. Kopald of Mem-

E. Marshall .

phis, Tenn. (1978-present). In
addition, the university relied
heavily on the leadership of two
volunteer organizations, the 60-
member Achievement Council
and the 64-member Develop-
ment Council, during the pro-
gram.

Through the development
program, the university has
more than doubled the size of its
1972 endowment in_ strict
monetary figures. In 1972 when
the program was announced,
the endowment stood at roughly
$22-million; commitments for
new endowment total $22.8-
million.

General endowment income
is used primarily for faculty
Salaries and student services.
The student-aid endowment
provides virtually all the finan-
cial assistance for approx-
imately 26 percent of the W&L
student body.

As a result of endowment
gifts added through the develop-
ment program, the university
has been able to create 72 en-
dowed scholarships, six endow-
ed professorships, three endow-
ed teaching funds, and
numerous memorial endow-
ments in support of particular
academic activities.

When the university’s board
of trustees announced the pro-
gram in 1972, it made the an-
nual giving programs an in-
tegral part of the overall effort.
Washington and Lee depends on
annual giving for approximate-
ly 11 percent of its educational
and general operating budget.

A projection of $8.2-million
was set for annual giving be-

tween 1971-72 and the end of :

1981. The annual giving pro-
gram ‘and other forms of
unrestricted current gifts ex-
ceeded that goal by $5.2-million,
enabling Washington and Lee to
balance its budget each year
over the period during which in-
flation. and an erratic stock
market presented unusually dif-
ficult financial realities.

When the development pro-
gram was announced in 1972, a
new $3.2-million addition to the
university’s Doremus Gym-
nasium had just been com-
pleted and represented the first
fund-raising objective included
in the comprehensive program.

Since 1972, the following pro-
jects (in addition to the gym-
nasium) have been physically
completed and entirely funded
from gifts made as part of the
development program: Lewis
Hall, the $8-million law school
building; the  $9.2-million
University Library; a $3.2-
million project to remodel the
former library building to
become the home of the School
of Commerce, Economics, and
Politics; the $1.5-million
renovation of Tucker and
Newcomb Halls on the universi-
ty’s historic Colonnade;
restoration of the Lee-Jackson
House; and, extensive develop-
ment of the campus grounds.

During the course of the
development program, three
other major projects have been
undertaken but not financed by

gifts made to the development
program: new apartment-like
dormitories for students, the
Woods Creek Apartments; in-
terior reconstruction of
Graham-Lees freshman dor-
mitory; and, a modernized
kitchen for Evans Dining Hall.

Two other facilities which
were not among the formal ob-
jectives of the development pro-
gram and therefore not includ-
ed monetarily in the results of
the effort are the Skylark Farm
Conference Center on the Blue
Ridge Parkway, a gift from Mr.
and Mrs. Leslie Cheek Jr. of
Richmond, Va., and 30 Univer-
sity Place, a center for the
decorative arts which is the
result of an anonymous gift.

The largest single capital gift
to the development program
was from Frances and Sydney
Lewis of Richmond, Va., who
contributed $9-million for the
law school building and later
gave the university an addi-
tional $1.5-million for other
capital purposes.

An analysis of the constituen-
cy sources of gifts shows that
$44.9-million (67 percent) came
from alumni; $12.4-million (18.5
percent) from friends of the
university ; $5.7-million (8.5 per-
cent) from foundations; $3.8-
million (5.7 percent) from cor-
porations; and, $0.2-million (0.3

percent) from Washington and

Lee’s faculty and staff.

Washington and Lee con-
ducted two separate phases of
its overall program.

19 Students Are ‘Tapped In’ At ODK Ceremonies

Nineteen undergraduates and
law students at Washington and
Lee were “tapped,” or in-
itiated, Tuesday into member-
ship in Omicron Delta Kappa,
the national honorary leader-
ship society that was founded at
W&L in 1914. In addition, four
men, including three W&L
alumni, were inducted as
honorary members of Omicron
Delta Kappa.

The ceremonies were part of
the university’s annual
Founders’ Day convocation.

The honorary initiates were:

fund-raising organization
established by and for the
benefit of 12 major, privately-
supported colleges in Virginia;

-Dr. Sidney M. B. Coulling, a
1946 graduate of Washington
and Lee and chairman of the
university’s English depart-

members, would not get sick
and tired of it by its end.

Joining a frat is a major step
for the individual freshman,
even more so for the frat. The
system must be shaped to his
advantage or else we must face
the question of whether the
fraternity system exists for the
students or the freshmen exist
for the fraternity system. In the
words of Gene Brodie, one-time
Rush Chairman, “Give me a
freshman at an impressionable
age, and he is ours for life.”’ It is
my sincere hope that this ques:
tion is thoroughly discussed.

Many thanks for your con-
sideration.

W&L Swimmers Among
Best In The Country

The Washington and Lee
swim team has stormed into the
Division III national ‘‘best
time’’ rankings compiled by the
College Swimming Coaches
Association as several Generals
appear on the most recent
listing, which is dated January
12.

W&L swimmers stand atop
four categories: senior Mike
Bernot (Hampton, Va.) in the
50-yard freestyle at 21.21
seconds and in the 100-yard
freestyle with 46.41 seconds;
sophomore Tim Rock (Houston,
Tex.) in the 1000-yard freestyle
with a clocking of 9:59.34; and
in the 400-yard freestyle relay
where W&L stands at 3:14.18.

In addition, Bernot also
stands third in the 200-yard
freestyle category and Rock
fourth in the 500-yard freestyle
division.

Sophomores Rand McClain
(Miami, Fla.) and Jeff Gee
(Johnson City, Tenn.) also ap-
pear in the listings. McClain is
fourth in the 50-yard freestyle,
third in the 100 free, and tenth in
the 2000 free. Gee stands
seventh in the 200-yard

 

backstroke. W&L also owns a
seventh place ranking in the
400-yard medley relay event.
“Each year we’re placing
more and more swimmers in
these rankings which are in-
valuable for sizing up com-
petitors to the NCAA Division

III Championships,” explains

 

Aquaman Mike Bernot
head coach Page Remillard.
‘I’m pleased to see us in these
rankings. I hope it pays off
when we reach the champion-
ships.” The NCAA Division III
event is set for March 18-19-20 at
Washington and Lee.

The rankings come out when
the Generals are deep into the

schedule. W&L currently stands
1-2 on the season following
losses this past Friday, Jan. 15
to James Madison (64-40) and
Saturday, Jan. 16 to Towson
state (74-28) in action at the Cy
Twombly Pool. The Generals
will resume action this Friday
evening at the University of
Richmond and Saturday after-
noon against Appalachain State
at the V.M.I pool.

“Our dual meet plan is to find
depth in each event and give our
swimmers the chance to
develop versatility outside of
their specialty,’’ offers
Remillard. “It’s not a good idea
to force your athletes to swim
their specialty each time,
especially in back-to-back
meets, so we let them try their
wings in new areas.”’

Remillard points to Bernot,
McClain, and junior Rob
Crawford (Ft. Walton Beach,
FL.) as examples. “Bernot is
our top freestyle sprinter but
swam in the 200-yard individual
medley against Madison, turn-
ing in our season’s best time.
McClain, another sprinter, and
Crawford, our breaststroker,
have been-working in the 500-
yard freestyle event,” relates
Remillard.

by Rick Swagler

Some people have said that
John Butler is a quiet type of
person. This, however, is only a
case of actions speaking louder.
than words. The senior
psychology major at W&L is
quite a good kayaker. So good,
in fact, that last year in the
world championships held in
Wales he led the United States
team to a second place finish
behind the French. In the in-
dividual standings, he finished
third. ‘

Butler switched from open
canoeing to kayaking in 1975
when his father bought a kayak.
Each year from mid-April to
mid-July, Butler trains at the
Nantahala Outdoor Center in
North Carolina. The area has

 

what is to considered to be some
of the best whitewater in the
country and is a mecca for
many American kayakers.
While at school, Butler trains on
the Maury River, although this
is just flat water training.
Butler also lifts weights, runs,
and enjoys racquetball.

There are two types of kayak-
ing: white water in which
Butler concentrates, and flat
water. Both are scored strictly
on time. In white water, there is
no set course and the race lasts
twenty to thirty minutes. Flat
water is different in that it is
usually held on a lake and is
either a 500 or 1000 meter race.

When asks what it takes to be
a good kayaker, Butler replied:
“Part of it is a natural, and then
I think like any other sport that
you're competing in, a lot of it is
just hard work. You have to put
in time.”

 

White Water Champion

With the Olympics only two
years away, Butler has begun to
make plans. One small stumbl-
ing block, though, is the fact that
flat water kayaking is the only
event held. ‘‘I’ll probably try
for the 1984 Olympic team, but
since I haven’t raced flat water,
I don’t have any idea how I'll
do,”’ Butler commented.

Bulter plans on attending the
1983 World ‘Championships
(they are only held every other
year) in Italy and even has a
map on his wall with the site
circled.

Although Butler did well at
the 1981 World Championships,
he did have some problems. At
10:30 on the morning of the
race, the course was closed to
practice. Although the team
manager knew about it, he
neglected to post the informa-
tion. Butler and some others
went out for some practice not
knowing it was closed. As
Butler recalls, ‘‘I was the only
one who was caught on the
course, so they disqualified me.
[had to file an official reinstate-
ment and all that stuff. I actual-
ly raced wihtout knowing
whether I was qualified. It was
a nice high, though, because as
soon as I crossed the finish line,
I heard that I had. been re-
instated and then ten or fifteen
seconds later I heard that I had
moved into third position.”

The amount of time Butler
has put into his kayaking has
been costly — especially his
taking off each spring to train.
When asked if this was just a
sacrifice he decided to make,
Butler replied, “I don’t really
consider it a sacrifice.”

 

   

Host Invitational

Davidson. Virginia schools in-
clude Hampden-Sydney, Long-
wood, Lynchburg and W&L. All
eight schools competed in last
year’s tourney in which
Catawba edged Elon by three
points, 57.5-54.5. W&L was
eleventh in that tourney.

“‘We should improve our team
finish this time around simply

_ because we are an improved

team, especially in the upper
classes,” said Franke. “Last
year, only three of our wrestlers
stood a good chance in the in-
vitational. This time, we’ve got
at least five who should perform
well.”’

Sophomore and Captain Tim

Homebody Generals Reach 8-4, Roanoke Tonight

by G. Bruce Potter

The team that performed
very well at home (7-1) and
equally poorly on the road.(1-7)
in the NFL last season was call-
ed the Detroit Lions. In col-
legiate basketball, you might
label them the Washington and
Lee Generals.

A 55-53 loss to Bridgewater on
the road sandwiched between
home victories over Emory and
Henry 63-50 and Johnson State
89-41 raised the Generals record
to 8-4, but they are winless away
from the friendly confines of the
Warner Center.

“I’m not sure what our pro-
blem is on the road,’’ said head
coach Verne Canfield. ‘‘But I
know there are a lot of factors
involved. It means something
for other teams to beat us.”’

Brian Hanson, who led all
scorers with 20 points, and John
Lee Graves combined for ten
points over a seven-minute
stretch of the second half
against Emory and Henry as
the Generals ran off 12
unanswered points to rebound
from a four-point deficit and
take a 54-46 lead with 3:53 left in
the half.

The Wasps had taken a seven
point lead at 40-33 early in the
final half, but four points by Jay
Fechtel and a basket by George
Spears pulled the Generals
back intothe contest.

Poor shooting had kept them
behind throughout much of the
game as W&L only shot 37.7%
from the floor compared to the

Wasps’ 47.8%. “We didn’t take
shots within the structures and

limitations of our offense,’’ ex-.

plained Canfield.

The Bridgewater game on
Saturday night was almost an
exact copy of the Emory and
Henry game except the teams
were reversed. This time it was
W&L who took the big early

lead, 16-4 midway through the
first half and 40-31 with 16:55
left in the game, but
Bridgewater battled back by
holding the Generals scoreless
for over eight minutes to create
a see-saw struggle that went
down to the buzzer.

Frank Eppes’ basket gave the
Generals their last lead at 51-50
with 2:21 remaining, but the
Eagles hit on five of six foul
shots over that time span, and
Spears’ potential game-winning
shot was off the mark with ten
seconds left.

“We were defensed during
the second half,” said Canfield.
“We just stood around and lost
the ball, and the turnovers turn-
ed the momentum and got the
crowd into the game.”

The Generals, now 2-2 in the
ODAC, committed 18 turnovers
and shot 50% from the floor, but
only 3-5 from the foul line.
Bridgewater, on the other hand,
shot 43.1% and 85% (17-20),
respectively. Hanson and
Spears contributed 12 points
apiece to the Generals’ cause,
and Graves added 10.

The 89-41 victory over
Johnson St. (Vermont) was the
Generals’ biggest since a 93-34
crushing of Massachusetts
Maritime early in the 1974-75
campaign. Graves led a parade
of 13 Generals who figured in
the scoring by hitting on 7 of 11
shots and a free throw for 15
points. Fechtel added a career-
high 12 points, as did Hanson.

Shooting 58.5% from the floor
to Johnson State’s 35.1%, the
Generals only trailed at 2-0, but
quickly scored ten straight
points and just kept increasing
the lead from there. It was 43-16
at the half, and hit the 50-point
mark with 18 seconds remain-
ing on Jackson MacFarlane’s

lay-up at 89-39. As well as
- shooting so poorly from the

floor, the Indians (0-7) only hit
on 3 of 14 foul shots (21.4%).

The Generals now turn their
attention to Roanoke College,
11-1 and ranked 11th in the na-
tion last week, at the Warner
Center at 8:00 tonight. ‘In-
dividual talent-wise, we match

up very poorly with Roanoke. ~

But if we stay within the struc-
tures of our offense and
defense, we’ll have a chance,”’
said Canfield.

He added that two keys to the
game would be Washington and
Lee’s reaction to the Maroons’
pressure defense and how well
they keep Roanoke off the offen-
sive boards.

For comparison’s_ sake,
Roanoke was upset by Emory.

and Henry 64-63 on Saturday

night and beat Johnson State
88-59 on Monday.

Graves leads the Generals
with 15.7 points a game. Close
behind is Hanson, who is
averaging 12.3 and leads the
team in rebounds with 6.8 a

game.

Review:

‘Bandits’ Is Lost In Time

by Todd Jones

Time Bandits is considered to
be the sleeper hit of this season.
It has been billed as a ‘Wizard
of Oz” for the current ‘‘young
generation.” While the film ap-
peals to young people, it is only
a ‘Wizard of Oz’ in the sense
that there are midgets in both
movies.

The film deals with a little
boy who is captured (willingly)
by five midgets. These midgets
have a map of the universe.
They explain to the boy that
since the world was created in
only a week, there are certain
flaws in its construction, and at
certain times at certain places,
holes appear through which you
can travel to another time.

These five midgets are
travelling through history,
stealing all the valuable things
they can find and then escaping
through the holes. At various
times, they meet up with
Napoleon, Robin Hood, Ogres,
Evil and even take a ride on the
Titanic.

In each of these instances, the
scenes are played to a comic

end and then the midgets move
on. Finally, the midgets are
trapped by Evil, who, with the
map, will control the world.
If this were indeed ‘‘The Wizara
of Oz,” Judy Garland would
have danced and sung her way
out of such a mess. Instead, the
midgets (after eating the heads
of rats) call on the cavalry,
medieval knights and laser
guns to battle the bad guy. The
midgets are not saved, how-
ever, until The Supreme Being
pays a visit and destroys most
of Evil. Unfortunately, the little
bit of Evil that remains appears
in the boy’s parents’ toaster
oven. We leave the theatre with
the knowledge that we must still
combat evil in today’s society,
or hope that Letitia Pate does
not use toaster ovens.

Time Bandits has an ex-
cellent supporting cast in the
likes of John Cleese (of Monty
Python fame) Sean Connery,
David Warner, Michael Palin,
Shelley Duvall and Kathryn
Hellman. While featured only in
short segments, they combine
to provide an excellent back-

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s major art exhibition for
this year is currently being
presented in the duPont art
gallery.

The traditionally local theme
for the big presentation is
Natural Bridge. This enormous
phenomenon of nature has in-
spired many early American
artists. There are almost 50
works of these artists dating
from 1787-1890 included in the
exhibit.

“So Beautiful an Arch’’ con-
tains many works of great
value. One of the most beautiful
paintings in the exhibit, a work
by F.E. Church (1852) on loan
from the University of Virginia
art museum, is insured for
$150,000. The painting of highest
value, entitled ‘‘Peaceable
Kingdom of the Branch”’ by Ed-
ward Hicks (1825-1830) and on
loan from Reynolds House, is
insured for $200,000.

Because the exhibit is of such
great value, students are en-
couraged to volunteer to sit in
the gallery during their free
time. $1.50 will be pledged to the
Superdance for every hour
donated to gallery sitting.

One of the most impressive
works of the exhibit was painted
by David Johnson in 1860, This
work is especially interesting
because it depicts the bridge
from. a long view. The intricate
detail of the foliage combines

well with the exactness of the
bridge and its surroundings.

Another remarkable portrait
is one done by F.E. Church in
1852. His representation of the
bridge from a frontal view is
perhaps the most detailed work
in the exhibit. Church uses ex-
tremely accurate colors to
depict the rock formations,
foliage and sky. His beautiful
cloud formations and light and
dark tints are some of the most
appealing aspects of the work.

The collection of works in the
exhibit’ possesses not only
monetary value, but also great
historical value. Pamela H.
Simpson, producer of the ex-
hibit, said.in a Jan. 8 speech
that the exhibit is best seen as
“a. panorama of changing at-
titudes toward nature and
painting.”

According to Dean Simpson,
there are three separate divi-
sions in the method of portray-
ing the bridge. The first of these

 

ground to the midgets’ antics.
The film was produced and
directed by Terry Gillam.
George Harrison provided the
music and the money to make
the film. The special effects are
quite good. It is obvious that a
good deal of attention was paid
to detail. The castle of evil is
created out of lego blocks.

The main drawback to the
film is that many of the
segments are much too long.
The laughs come much too far
between. The film does have a
great deal of creativity,
however, and enough humor to
be entertaining. While Time
Bandits is no ‘‘Wizard of Oz,” it
is worth seeing.

Soprano
Performs

Soprano Ann Berlin will ap-
pear in concert at 8 p.m., Mon.,
Jan. 25, in Lee Chapel. The con-
cert is the third presentation of
the Washington and Lee Univer-
sity Concert Guild’s 1981-82
season. Mrs. Berlin will be ac-
companied by pianist Cheryl
Ryan and guitarist Gene
Carter.

The program will consist of
“Serate Musicali” by Rossini,
“Italianisches Liederbuch”’ by
Wolf, ‘‘Trois Chanson’ by
Chausson and “Letters from
Composers”’ by Argento.

A lecturer in music at Hollins
College, Mrs. Berlin, is soloist
and children’s choir director at
St. John’s Episcopal Church in
Roanoke. She earned her B.A.
degree from Hollins, where she
majored in music.

Mrs. Berlin has performed in
the Southwest Virginia Opera
Society productions of “Die
Fledermaus’’ (as Adele), ‘“‘The
Ballad of Baby Doe” (as Sarah)
and “The Marriage of Figaro”
(as Cherubine). She also ap-
peared in the Hollins produc-
tions of ‘“The Old Maid and the
Thief” (as the Old Maid) and
“The Unicorn’”’ (as the wife).

Tickets are $3 and will be
available at the door. Members
of the Washington and Lee com-
munity are admitted free of
charge.

 

methods is the sublime attitude
of the late 18th and early 19th
centuries. During this period,
the bridge was regarded with
both terror and mystery, while
at the same time posessing a
mysterious force. The paintings
of this period depicted the
bridge with emphasis on its size
in relation to surrounding ob-
jects.

The second division occured
in the.mid 1800’s. At this time,

artists felt their interpretations
of the bridge should reflect
God’s presence through natural
beauty. The majority of these
paintings contain minute
details of grass, trees and rock
formations with less emphasis
on the magnitude of the bridge.
The third division of bridge
portrayals is found in the works
of the late 19th century. Artists

A Few Excerpts From Dr. Coulling’s ODK Address

The following are excerpts from
Tuesday’s Founder’s Day speech
by Dr. Sidney Coulling.

Even the most jaded veteran of
our observance of January 19
must agree that today is a very
great day in the more than two
and a quarter centuries of
Washington and Lee’s history.
How, I asked myself, could I
possibly be adequate to such an
occasion, to say anything even
remotely worthy to follow news
of the successful completion of
an extraordinarily ambitious
campaign? As a child I was
often told of the lonely efforts by
the rector of Washington
Academy to raise funds for his
struggling school, traveling by
horse throughout much of the
state and returning from one
absence to discover that the
academy had lost to fire its only
building of any size. As an
undergraduate I was periodic-
ally reminded that although
James River Canal stock might
not be what it once had been,
some of my tuition was still be-
ing paid by the gift from George
Washington. And as a member
of the faculty I shared the em-
barrassment felt here when the
drive to finance what is now
Parmly Hall fell substantially
short of its objective. What can
I say, then, after an announce-
ment that the University has
raised a sum of money, to use a
figure that may in some man-
ner relate it to our founding
fathers, more than four times
that of the Louisiana Purchase?

I am by profession not a fund-
raiser but a teacher of English
literature, and I learned long
ago that one of my calling can
partly if not entirely conceal his
inadequacies by relying on a
text. And so I have adopted that
stratagem today, choosing as
my text a classic treatise on
liberal education that may help
remind us of the ultimate pur-
pose for which these millions
have been given to Washington
and Lee. It is the series of lec-
tures — or discourses, as they
were called — which John
Henry Newman delivered in
Dublin, Ireland, 130 years ago
this spring and which we now
know as The Idea of a Universi-
ty.

S2OCCOHCEOEES

The past never returns,
Newman once observed, and
my purpose in speaking of him
today is not to hold up his
discourses of a century ago as
absolute models by which to
shape our thinking about liberal
education at the present time.
Although he has been rightly
called ‘‘one of the greatest in-
tellectual forces Oxford has
even known,” it can hardly be
denied that huge chasms now
separate his thought from ours.
For him, truth was one and in-
divisible; for us it is multiple
and infinitely fragmented. For
him, knowledge was a complete
circle of linked parts; for us, if
we must describe it by a
geometric form, it is Rubik’s
cube. For him it was reasonable
to say that the function of a
university is to teach universal
knowledge; for us, to say so is to
voice an absurdity.

Between the demands, on the
one hand, for religious or sec-
tarian instruction, and on the
other for vocational or profes-
sional training, Newman
steered a course that could
please neither side. The aim of
a university, he said, was not
moral or religious or practical,
but intellectual — it is the
cultivation, the enrichment, the
enlargement of the mind for its
own sake.

20008808606 808

And there are still more
significant parallels. Newman
was aware, for example, of the
phenomenon that has become
the bane of higher education
—overspecialization — for at
Oxford he had known narrow-
minded pedants, embalmed
corpses impersonating
scholars, the kind that Carlyle
satirized as Dryasdust, that
George Eliot _ brilliantly
depicted as Casaubon in
Middlemarch, and that the
historian G.M. Young later
characterized as ‘“‘the Waste
Land of Experts, each knowing
so much about so little that he
can neither be contradicted nor
is worth contradicting.’
Newman never condemns spec-
ialization as such, recognizing
its essential place in the modern
world. But he stresses the need

for general culture, for balance
and breadth, for a view of
things beyond the confines of
one’s specialty. His own mind,
according to a remarkable
tribute by one of his ablest
students, ‘‘was world-wide. He
was interested in everything
which was going on in science,
in politics, in literature.
Nothing was too large for him,
nothing too trivial, if it threw
light upon the central question,
what man really was, and what
was his destiny.’’

For Newman, moreover, the
pursuit of knowledge was not
merely arduous; it was also
perilous, He was fully aware of
the truth of which President
Huntley has reminded us in the
past — that education is a
dangerous enterprise. Like his
fellow convert, Gerard Manley
Hopkins, he knew that the
‘“‘mind has mountains; cliffs of
fall/Frightful, sheer, no-man-
fathomed.” At the age of 14,
after reading some French
verse that denied the immor-
tality of the soul, he had ex-
claimed to himself, ‘How
dreadful, but how plausible!”
And in the conclusion to his
Apologia he speaks of the
human intellect as ‘‘wild,”
‘‘Capricious,’’ ‘‘untrust-
worthy.’’ No wonder Huxley
said that he could compile a

primer of infidelity from the
works of Cardinal Newman. But
if there is danger in using the
mind, there is equal danger,
Newman recognized, in not us-
ing it. He was _ thoroughly
familiar with the romantic
malaise of introspection, of
morbid self-consciousness, of
Byronic despair and ennui —
the malaise that has its contem-
porary counterpart in boredom,
in the absence of motivation
and sense of purpose, in the
kind of paralyzing indifference
that has provoked a faculty
member at Ohio University to
Say, as quoted in a recent issue
of the Washington Post, that his
students ‘take down anything
and spit it back to me even
though they don’t believe it. The
reason is they don’t believe
anything.”” The mind can never
be released from such inertia,
Newman believed, unless it is
exercised on the world without.
And though he had surrendered
claim to complete freedom of
thought when he submitted to
the infallible church, deep im-
pulses that he seems never
finally to have subdued led him
to insist that the use of the kind
is both our right and our duty.
Nothing, he says at the begin-
ning of The Idea of a University,
can prevent the human intellect
from speculating; and at the
end, when arguing that the
ultimate purpose of education is

to prepare one for the world, he
declares that “the way to learn
to swim in troubled waters’’ is
to go into them.

He was drawn to nautical im-
agery, as this last phrase might
suggest, and one imagines that
he admired the tribute Words-
worth paid to Newton’s mind,
““forever/Voyaging through
strange seas of thought, alone.’
In any case it is significant, I
think, that the image serves a
crucial purpose in The Idea of a
University no less than in the
Apologia. A stormy sea is
Newman’s metaphor for the in-
tellectually confused as well as
for the spiritually adrift, and a
port his metaphor for the
cultivated mind as well as for
the Roman Catholic Church.
The voyage to intellectual
enlargement is no less long, dif-
ficult, and hazardous than
Newman’s own voyage to
Rome, but both voyages end in
repose, in the satisfying sense,
as Newman puts it in another
context, of knowing and of
knowing that one knows. The in-
tellectual certainty that ter-
minates one voyage is the cer-
titude of faith that terminates
the other, and the ‘calmness,
moderation, and wisdom’’ of
the liberally educated are thus
the secular equivalents of the
peace that passes all
understanding.

Atwood Elected Director

Edward C. Atwood, dean of
the School of Commerce, Eco-
nomics and Politics at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, has been elected director of
the Southern Business Adminis-
tration Association for the

The SBAA is a _ non-profit
organization for the promotion
and improvement of collegiate
education for business in the
South. The association has 215
member institutions which are
located in the southeastern
quadrant of the United States.

Atwood has been active in the
association for a number of
years. He was elected to the
SBAA’s executive committee in

1979.

Atwood has been dean of the
W&L commerce school since
1969. Prior to that, he was
W&L’s dean of students. At-

wood is also professor of
economics, having received his
undergraduate, master’s and
Ph.D. degrees from Princeton
University.

Hillsdale Donates $24,000 For Minority Studies

by Todd Smith

A North Carolina charitable
institution has donated $24,000
to finance minority scholar-
ships at Washington and Lee
over the next three years.

This is the second grant since
1972 from the Hillsdale Fund
Inc., which was established by
the family of the late Lunsford

  

John L. White, W&L Director of Minority Affairs.

Richardson Sr., chairman of the
board of Richardson-Vicks Inc.
Sion A. Boney, administrative
vice president of the Hillsdale
Fund, said that its board of
trustees was ‘delighted to be
able to participate in this in-
novative scholarship program
at Washington and Lee.”’
John L. White, director of

   

minority affairs; said that the
grant indicated respect for and
approval of the university’s
minority program. ‘‘At least
they felt we were doing enough
things right,” said White.

White predicted that the
money would be used for com-
petitive scholarships of a value
between $1,000 and $1,200. Ap-
plicants will be judged by class
rank and board scores, he said.

“T think they (at the Hillsdale
Fund) are cognizant that we
just don’t give out the money
because we have it,” said
White. White said that he may
have some freedom with the
three-year deadline. ‘‘If we feel
that only three students qualify
for scholarships one year,
Hillsdale is going to under-
stand.”

The scholarships may help
give Washington and Lee a
recruiting incentive in a time of
cutbacks in student aid from the
federal government. ‘‘The
market in minority students is
going to decrease, and more

recruit them,’’ said White.

“President Reagan is going to
make the college income thing
very difficult,” said the 29-year-
old director. ‘I think it
penalizes an institution like

EC Considers Deferred Rush

(continued from page 1)

Ted McQuiston, ’84 Rep., mo-
tioned that the E.C. encourage
the IFC to look into the possi-
bilities of a deferred rush. The
motion passed, 11-0.

E.C. Secretary Bennett Ross
said he would write a letter to
IFC President Hall Vetterlein,
The letter will state that the
E.C. sees deferred rush as a
serious issue which should be
addressed by the IFC.

In other matters, Dusty
Nelson reported that the Stu-
dent Bar Association has been
inactive for the past month. Ex-
ams before Christmas and
preparations for the February
bar examination have limited
activities. Tripp Brower asked
Nelson about the restructuring
of the Law School Placement
Office. ‘“‘The office is doing a
fine job for students with good
grades and qualifications,”
replied Nelson. ‘‘Not enough
emphasis has been placed on
other students interested in
government.”

Myers questioned an item in
the S.B.A. budget concerning a
transfer of $3,715 to the Law
News account. There was a
mentioning of the money’s
origin. Nelson was not familiar
with the budget and said he
would check with S.B.A.
Treasurer Chris Chapman.
Nelson said he was sure the
money had not been pocketed.
Myers added that the normal
procedure is to keep the money
in the students tax fund until ex-

 

penditures are necessary.

In an ad-hoc report, Frank
Smith said that Fancy Dress is
progressing well. The Student
Activities Board under-

estimated ticket sales and will -

probably cover the $55,000
budget through ticket sales. “If
a deficit occurs,’’ added Smith,
“it would affect the rest of the
year’s social activities.”

Brower and Hale commented
that the Reggae party held last
Friday in Evans Dining Hall ap-
peared to be a success. Security
was not a problem and Jerry
Darrell, Director of Food Ser-
vices, said he was pleased with
the event. Brower added that
the Student Control Committee
had an unusually low number of
discipline cases last term.
“Students seem under control,”’
added Brower.

The S.C.C. did pass one con-
troversial ruling, however.
Students convicted of drunk
driving offenses must appear
before the committee. Brower
added that the S.C.C. will con-
sider each case, but there are
no exact penalties for DWI con-
victions.

John Viahoplus stated that
some S.B.A. members are upset
with athletic teams who monop-
olize the weight room. He said
he would look into the problem.
Ted McQuiston replied that
most teams do have a
legitimate interest in weight-
training.

Two new ad-hoc positions
were filled. Freshman Rep.

Cole Dawson was appointed ad-
hoc member to the Outing Club.
First Year Law Rep. Tom
Booher was appointed to the
Computer Club.

Myers reported that some
students approached him about
allowing computer courses to
be included in Math/Science
distibution credits. Booher, as
newly-appointed member of the

Computer Club, was nominated .

to look into the situation.

Myers noted that a Red Cross

blood drive will be held in
Doremus Gym on Jan. 26.

 

 

Bridge
Exhibit

(continued from page 6)
during this period interpreted
the bridge as _ picturesque,
rather than awesome or
mysterious. Moreover, the
bridge was used as a
background object, rather than
the principle subject.

Dean Simpson believes that
Natural Bridge ‘“‘is too often
dismissed as a tourist attrac-
tion.” She hopes that in viewing
the exhibition, we might ‘‘cap-
ture again the awe that these
earlier artists felt for it.”’

The exhibit will continue to be
presented through Jan. 29 and
will be followed by an exhibit of
20th century photography,
which will be on display Feb.

ty students that can do the
work.”

Another obstacle to recruit-
ment is the growing trend
among blacks to attend pre-
dominately black colleges, ac-
cording to White. In addition,
the very nature of Washington
and Lee, with its small, all male
enrollment, causes obstacles.
W&L cannot recruit black
women, who score higher in
placement tests than black

males.
The basic problem faced by

- recruiters, however, is the

university’s relative obscurity
in minority circles. ‘‘This is a
school that is very  well-
respected in generally upper-
middle-class, white social
circles, It is difficult getting a
reputation among minorities
like Notre Dame or Harvard,”
said White.

The annual process of the
recruitment of minorities at
Washington and Lee begins
when the College Testing Ser-
vice mails the university a list
of 1,400 highly-rated minority
students. A ‘‘mail campaign’
follows, said White, as the
university tries to drum up in-
terest. Minority students are
contacted by black and white
alumni and by blacks currently
enrolled at W&L.

Matthew Towns is an exam-

ple of one such dedicated alum-
nus. A 1974 graduate of W&L
and currently vice president of
the Wacoia Bank of Winston-
Salem, Towns personally writes
all minority applicants.

In the three years that White
has served as minority affairs
director, the university has
received an average of 30 ap-
plications per year. The minori-
ty acceptance rate is 80 percent.
Even in 1978, the worst of recent
years for the Washington and
Lee admissions office, the ac-
ceptance rate of all applicants
has stayed below 75 percent.

In the 15 years since
Washington and Lee first ad-
mitted blacks, 65 percent of its
black students have graduated.
Hillsdale scholars, however,
boast a 90 percent graduation
rate.

White, himself a black
graduate from W&L in 1974,
saw the number of black fresh-
men fall from 15 to seven in his
second year. “I know places
where that kind of fluctuation
can cost you your job,” he said.

The university, however, was
interested in the quality instead
of numbers of minorities ac-
cepted, White said. ‘The
university has made a committ-
ment to having a diverse stu-
dent body and is willing to back
that up with dollars.”

Blood Drive Tuesday

by Bill Woolfolk

The Red Cross will hold a
Blood Drive Tues., Jan. 26, in
Doremus Gymnaisium from 11
a.m. to 5 p.m. The donation
.center is being organized by the
Alpha Epsilon medical fraterni-
ty, the College Republicans and
the Chi Psi social fraternity.

Part of the sponsorship of
these groups includes the dona-
tion of a keg of beer to be
awarded to the fraternity with
the highest percentage of par-
ticipation in the blood drive.

Fraternity members do not ac-

tually have to give blood but
musy be processed through the
line.

Without a reservation, the
length of processing will depend
on the number of participants.
With a reservation, however,
the entire process should take
somewhere between 40 and 50
minutes.

The Red Cross: advises all
donors to avoid strenuous ac-
tivity immediately after giving
blood. No strain should be plac-

Brower added that “‘it’s still
not too late to dance,”’ Students
can still register as late as Fri-

hours of giving blood. Within
that period, the puncture must

An average human needs be-

Superdance Set To Kick Off

by Tom Baker

Besides being an event in-
volving as many as 200 dancers,
the Washington and Lee annual
dance marathon for Muscular
Dystrophy is expected to be a
great party. The thirty-hour
event features bands, pie
throws, and similar festivities
designed for those who want to
come and observe the action.

A year ago, 160 dancers took
part in the event which raised
more than $12,000 for the benefit

of the Muscular Dystrophy
Association.

The four bands include the
Robbin Thompson Band, a
group that will play beach and

- rock music beginning at 8 p.m.

Friday night; Casper, a top-40
band that will play from 11 p.m.
—3a.m., Friday — Saturday.

On Saturday, the Red Ball
Jets, a hard-rock band similar
to Trax, will appear from 6 p.m.
to 10 p.m. The final band will be
The Drifters, a beach band that

will perform from 10 p.m. to 2
a.m,

Miller Grills Students

In Privacy

by Todd Smith

“There is no longer any place,
literally or figuratively, to
hide,”’ said Harvard Law Pro-
fessor Arthur Miller in an ad-
dress on journalism and the
right of privacy in Lee Chapel
on Tuesday.

“Every time we turn around
we are interrogated, reported,
surveyed, questioned,
dossiered....’’ said Miller, who
arrived 30 minutes late eating
an ice cream cone. He noted a
“privacy revolution” was mak-
ing it more difficult for the
media to investigate in-
dividuals’ credit ratings and
criminal records.

Miller has written 25 books
and is a weekly feature on ABC-
TV’s ‘‘Good Morning
America.” His public television
program ‘‘Miller’s Court’
shows him questioning an au-
dience jury on legal issues, a
technique he used on a 13-
person panel of W&L students
and professors.

“I think the beginning of
democracy is when I have
enough control over myself that
I deal out the informational
cards about myself,” said
Miller, ‘“‘and that the govern-

ment and the journalists are not'
to intrude upon my privacy, to
rip off my informational profile,
to ‘rape’ me, in the data sense.”’

Calling journalists ‘‘scream-
ing hemophiliacs stuck with
pins,’ Miller likened the
media’s resistance to privacy
laws to “the classic Chicken-
Little Syndrome.”

In his questioning of the
“jury” Miller said that no real
definition exists for what is
“newsworthy.” He said that the
decision whether to print a

‘potentially damaging story

rests on personal moralities of
writers and editors.
Miller illustrated his Socratic

Lexington’s

by Pryse Roy Elam

There were no violent crimes
and, in fact, there was an
overall decrease by 15 percent
in the number of complaints
handled by the Lexington Police
Department in the 1981 calen-
dar year, according to the An-
nual Police Report released last
Thursday’s Council meeting.

Lexington Police Chief James
A. Kirby said he had no idea
what caused the overall
decrease and said it was pro-
bably nothing more than
evidence of a year-to-year fluc-

tuation.

The report revealed that
there were no murder, man-
slaughter or rape charges
reported to the Department
during 1981. Breaking-and-
entering and theft declined by
as much as 60 percent, and
there were only two reports of
robbery. Of all the criminal
felonies and misdemeanors
reported, the Police Depart-
ment was able to solve approx-
imately 43 percent, which is
well above the national
average.

IFC Appoints Rush Committee

by Scott Mason

It was roughly two weeks ago
that whispers of a ‘Delayed’
Rush system began to emerge
from the voices of Interfraterni-
ty Council members. Since that
time, the Executive Committee
has broached the subject, too
and Rush has become a topic of
immense interest and debate.

Although discussion of a new-
ly proposed Rush system has
thus far experienced only
limited discourse, I.F.C. Presi-
dent Hall Vetterlein com-
mented that a five-man com-
mittee has been appointed ‘‘to
study problems with the current
system and possible problems
with a second semester Rush.”’

en ae

Tuesday’s Blood Drive netted 204 pints of blood for the Red Cross.

The committee, chaired by
senior Jack Wells, includes
head dorm counselor Rob
Staugaitis, sophomore
Christopher Lykes and two ad-
ditional fraternity members to
be named at a later date.

Both pros and cons with the
present system as well as those
of a new system which would
defer Rush for as many as six
weeks into the school year are
issues facing the I.F.C and its
five-man committee. Tae I.F.C.
is aware of the importance of a
freshman’s decision in choosing
a fraternity which is best suited
to his likes, and a delayed Rush
system would provide more

The total amount of goods
stolen by breaking and entering
and larcenies was slightly more
than $58,000. The Police Depart-
ment reported that it was only
able to recover about $14,000
worth of the stolen goods, which
amounts to a recovery rate of
nearly 25 percent.

Parking in a restricted zone
and improper parking were the
two most frequent law viola-
tions handled by the Depart-
ment. Together, these two
violations brought in revenues
from the fines of more than

$10,000.

The third most frequent viola-
tion was public drunkenness,
although it showed nearly a 50-
percent decrease in the number
of violations handled in 1981
from the 1980 figures. Chief Kir-
by attributed the decline in part
to new rulings concerning the
laws. “The person must pose
some sort of a threat to either
himself or the public before we
can arrest him now.’’ Kirby ex-
plained. The old law simply
held inebriation as suitable

time for him in making this
decision and in viewing houses,
ideally, without the ‘‘fronts’’
which fraternities often create.

Nevertheless, with a delayed
Rush, fraternities would lose an
estimated $1,000 a month in
revenue in the first term of the
year. Moreover, fraternities
would be ‘‘supporting freshmen

socially with only the
limited dués of present house

members by which to entertain
potential freshman pledges.

Both Vetterlein and Dan Mur-
phy, Assistant Dean of Students
for Fraternity Affairs, fear that

EC Sustains
Debate Over

Membership

by Ben Jarratt
The Executive Committee

debated a proposal Monday
night that would add two new
members to this governing
body.

The honor system functions
would change slightly as the
two members of the investigat-
ing team looking into honor
violations would not participate
in the hearings on that case.
Currently, they participate in
hearings.

The proposal, introduced last
week by third-year Law Rep.
Morgan Griffith, called for
representatives to be added to
the freshmen and second year
law classes. Griffith stated ‘‘the
primary purpose of this pro-
posal is to get the two members
of the investigative team set off
from the hearings. Griffith is
concerned with the possibility
of pre-trial prejudice by some
members of the E.C.

Review:

‘Seduction’ Off The Mark

by Todd Jones

According to the current ads
for The Seduction, Morgan
Fairchild is billed as a woman
alone, terrified, trapped like an
animal. But now she’s fighting
back with the only weapon she
has — herself! If that weapon is
her acting ability, Morgan is in
serious, serious trouble.

Fairchild has broken into the
world of cinema with The
Seduction. In this film she plays
a TV newscaster who is follow-
ed by a degenerate.

‘Breaking into the movies’’
might be a bad choice of words.
‘Crashing’ would be more ap-
propriate. Fairchild proves in
this movie that while she can
take off her clothes, she can’t do
much else. She acts worried by
looking off-screen. She acts
seductive by taking off her
clothes and then looking off-
screen. She acts concerned by
glancing in a mirror and then
looking offscreen. She has an
especially ‘touching’ scene
where she breaks down on na-
tional television, begins to cry,
and then looks off-screen.

Her lover is Michael Sar-
rizan, who spends most of his
time getting mad. He realis-
tically comes to the conclusion
that the only way to rid his lover
of this pest is to blow him away.

The pest who bothers Fair-
child is Derrick, played by An-
drew Stevens. Stevens pesters
Fairchild by calling her, taking
photos of her constantly and

Background:

The Men

Steve Wolf (Bass) — Of all the
actively engaged bass players
in and around the Washington
rock. scene, Steve Wolf has
perhaps the most colorful
background, and is undeniably
one of the most highly regarded
instrumental performers. Bar
none. He has come a long way
from the reggae and _ pro-
gressive jazz bands which pro-
vided his introduction to the
world of live music. Steve has
since performed with Bill
Holland and Rent’s Due, Prin-
cipato, Kennedy and Wolf, Dan-
ny Gatton and the Redneck Jazz
Explosion, The Catfish Hodge
Band and the Cheek-To-Cheek
Allstars. When the Nighthawks
needed a relief bass player for
the interned Jan Zukowski, they
called on Steve (who toured
with the Hawks for over three
months). In addition, Steve
plays on Bill Holland’s first
albums, both of Danny Gatton’s
albums and the new Catfish
Hodge album, Bout With The
Blues.

Larry Taylor (Drums,
Vocals) — is a popular Florida

following her around. It ap-
pears that he is quite mentally
unbalanced and goes from bad
to worse. He spends his time
looking crazy.

Derrick occasionally goes in-
to Fairchild’s house and then
walks around wearing only a
towel. In another scene, he is
content to sit nude in front of
her pictures. Luckily, he only
starts to fantasize and the scene
quickly changes.

He even spends as much time
as Morgan taking his shirt off.
This is probably due to the fact
that he sweats constantly.
Strangely enough, Stevens was
probably the best actor in the
movie. He spent most of his
time taking off his clothes, or
watching Morgan take off hers
and it is possible that in the
right film he could have done a
good job.

Also in the film is Fairchild’s
best friend, who walks through
the film in the ugliest clothing
imaginable. Her deep moving
revelations stir the hearts of all
viewers.

There is a psychologist who
determines that Derrick is
crazy by flipping a coin. A
policeman advocates getting a
gun and shooting Derrick. The
cop gets upset with Michael
Sarrizan by telling him not ‘‘to
get his Phi Beta gander up.”’

The film was written and
directed by David Schmueller
who probably will not go far.

ed to D.C. from Panama City.

Steve Baumann (Harp) and

could be deemed imaginative.
Rarely does one see a film in
which the walls change colors
while you are watching them.
The clothing changes color as
well.

The casting was by that bas-
tion of creative excellence, ‘‘B
and J Casting.’’ Somehow they
managed to find the same ex-
tras used in Dawn of the Dead,
and had them standing around
staring — usually directly into
the camera so their parents
could recognize them, or look-
ing creatively offscreen — pro-
bably trying to imitate Fair-
child.

In short, this movie doesn’t
make it. The script has Fair-
child spending one-third of her
time looking off screen, one-
third of her time saying the
word ‘“‘Brandon’”’ and one-third
of her time taking off her
clothes. Even the nude scenes
are unrealistic. Derrick is
hiding in a closet while Fair-
child takes off her clothes and
takes a bath. The phone rings,
and Fairchild gets out of the tub
to answer it. The camera shows
us Derrick sweating, unbutton-
ing his shirt, looking at Fair-
child’s feet. Who are they kid-
ding?

If this film is representative
of what Fairchild will be offer-
ing in future films, she had bet-
ter stay on ‘Flamingo Road,”
where she can look offscreen to
her heart’s content.

Behind ‘Rockhouse’

Marty Baumann (Guitar,
Vocals) — are an outstanding,
talented and well-respected
rhythm and blues team. Their
experience includes a period of
time in what was formerly one
of the Richmond areas most
popular bands, the Sliders.

‘Rockhouse’ Comes

To The Pit Tues.

Perhaps the most timeless,
enduring musical genre to be
found on today’s _live-music
scene is the  straight-ahead
rhythm and blues/boogie style
performed by the Nighthawks,
Allstars and the Skip Castro
Band (among others). In this
now-classic tradition, a new
group from Washington, D.C.
has taken up the vanguard
—Rockhouse. Rockhouse, hand-
picked by bassist Steve Wolf,
adds new direction and style to
the time-tested rhythm and
blues-rock sound. Playing a
wide variety of classic material

of artists ranging from Elvis
Presley and Clarence Carter to
Delbert McClinton and Albert
King, Rockhouse delivers a
high energy performance from
start to finish.

A variety of strong original
songs by guitarist Marty
Baumann lifts Rockhouse out of
the “copy band” category and
moves the group to the forefront
of the up-and-coming area
rockers. To get a glimpse of the
fastest-rising star on the rock
horizon, catch a Rockhouse per-
formance Tues. Feb. 2, in the
Cockpit. Admission is $1.
SAB Dropped Only $30

For Reggae Performance

The Student Activities Board
fell $30 short of breaking even
with the Mighty Invaders con-
cert in Evans Dining Hall, ac-
cording to SAB Co-Chairman
John Martin.

The Baltimore based reggae
band ‘“‘charged $1100 for the
Jan. 15 show,” Martin said.
There were other expenses he
said which included the cost of
32 kegs of beer, five cartons of
cups, 10 security people and a
fee charged by Building and
Grounds for setting up the
stage. When all the figures were
in, the SAB lost only $30 in the
venture.

According to University
Center Subcommittee Chair-
man Bob Schmidt, the reason
for having the band in Evans
Dining Hall, as opposed to the

Cockpit, had to do with
numbers. Schmidt said, ‘‘When
we have a good quality band
like this one, we want to make it
open to many people and not
just the few that can squeeze in-
to the Cockpit.”

According to Schmidt, more
bands that might draw a big
crowd may be presented in
Evans Dining Hall in the future,
provided Dining Hall Manager
Jerry J. Darrell approves.
Schmidt and Martin were both
pleased with the large turnout
of 800 people and Martin said
that Darrell was also impressed
with the results.

Martin also noted the size of
Coke sales, saying it was the
first time soft drinks had been
offered and was a success.

ROTC Rangers Conduct

‘Operation Freeze’

It was certainly a different
kind of Friday night road trip.
The roads were dark, infernally
crooked, and led not to a citadel
of collegiate beauty but rather
to an isolated crossing site of
the flooding Pedlar River in the
Washington National Forest.

The elite Ranger company of
W&L’s Army ROTC program
was off on another night opera-
tion, testing its patrolling and
reconnaissance skills against
an aggressor force, portrayed
by senior cadets.

The 16 cadet Rangers, all of
whom have passed exacting
physical, technical and leader-
ship tests, had been planning
the Jan. 8-9 mission since before
the Christmas holidays. The
realistic scenario envisioned a
night deployment by vehicle in-
to the national forest and then a
lengthy foot patrol to gather
combat information on the

“enemy” occupiers of the
hostile zone, and to raid and

destroy a key military bridge. It
was the job of W&L senior
cadets Tony lIerardi, Russ Rec-
tor, Milton Chalkley and Doug
Linton to oppose the Rangers
-and confound their plans. All
together, 25 W&L cadets braved
the elements in “Operation
Freeze.”

Under the close supervision of
Green Beret Sergeant First
Class Alvin Davis III, the week
of Jan. 4-8 was spent in a series
of mission briefings, planning
sessions, and dress rehearsals.
Key leaders for the operation
were Andrew MacLellan, ’84,
from Flemington, NJ, who
acted as the mission com-
mander; Rick Storey, ’84, a
native of West Chester, PA, who
served as second in command
and intelligence officer, and Ed-
ward O’Brien, ’84, from Nor-
wich, NY, who served as opera-
tions chief. Richard Jones, °84,
from Atlanta, GA, and James
Nance, ’85, a native of Ft.
Lauderdale, FL, rounded out
the Ranger staff.

Throughout, the learning ob-
jectives were realistic training,
secure operations, mastery of
patrol planning and execution,
and small unit leadership. It ap-
pears these goals were attained
since, in spite of freezing
temperatures which set records
in Western Virginia, and icy
river crossings, all the cadets’
operational objectives were
secured.

Planned in great detail and
executed with unusual realism,
Operation Freeze added
another chapter to the special
efforts and determination of
Washington and Lee’s Cadet
Rangers.

Schickele To Perform P.D.Q. Bach

Recording star and_ star
spoofer of classical music,
Peter Schickele and company
will be the third offering of this
year’s season of the Rockbridge
Concert-Theatre Series. The
farcical presentation will take
place in Lexington High School
Auditorium, on Wed., Feb. 3,
1982, at 8:15 p.m.

Though Lexington may not be
ready for him, Peter Schickele
will present an evening of The
Intimate P.D.Q. Bach —accord-
ing to Schickele ‘‘a program of
music, words, and_ slides
guaranteed to tell you more
about P.D.Q. Bach than you
care to know.”

Serious musicologists are still
reeling from _ Schickele’s

“discoveries.” Many wish he
had never ‘‘discovered”’ P.D.Q.
— the music is that bad. But au-

Peter Schickele is a very fun-

composer of serious music, that

he delights in making fun of
classical works. His is parody
at its best as his recordings, his
‘‘definitive’’ biography of
P.D.Q. Bach, his large au-

Professor Schickele has
chosen, among P.D.Q.’s
numerous works, to present the

‘‘Abassoonata;’’ the
‘‘Goldbrick Variations;’’
“Twelve Quite Heavenly

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team turned in a solid
performance Saturday when
eight of its ten members placed
in the W&L College Invitational.
None of the six other schools in
the meet showed more balance
through all of the weight divi-
sions than did the Generals.

Captain Tim Valliere and
freshman Joe O’Neill took the
individual championships at the
158 and 190-pound classes,
respectively, while freshman
Jeff Dixon was the runner-up at
177. Other Generals who
managed to place were Carlton
Peebles (third at heavyweight), |
Wes Payne (fourth at 134), Greg
Kendrick (fourth at 167), Elbert
Umila and Ron Thornton
(fourth at 118).

Despite having only one in-
dividual champion, Catawba
(N.C.) College claimed its third
consecutive team title. The In-
dians compiled a score of 61 and
one-half points to edge Pfeiffer

+} College, which had 60 and three-
4} quarter points and three in-

dividual champions. Elon Col-
lege, which also had three in-
dividual champions, placed
third with 59, and W&L was
fourth at 51. Longwood (45),

i Davidson (30) and Hamnpden-

Sydney (19) rounded out the
competition.

When W&L took the court
against Roanoke last Thursday
the fans went wild. After last
season’s matchup, the stage
was set for a real shootout in
Warner Center. As the Generals
formed their warm-up drills to
the near ecstatic block of men
in the stands, the public an-
nouncer introduced the in-
famous unknown fans who
brought an even more intense
mania to the arena. This was no
normal group of fans. There are
certain sport events that are
noticeably affected by the fans
and the Roanoke game was cer-
tainly one of them.

Roanoke’s opening throw-in
was quickly converted into a
W&L basket and a thunder of
voices shook Warner Center.
This was the strength of an all-
male school. The harassment of
the other team did not die out
after the opening plays. A call
on either team brought the fans
to their feet. Whether cheering

-or booing, the incessant noise
was deafening. A foul or simple
mistake by one of the Roanoke
players incited hundreds of ac-
cusatory fingers pointing out
the mistake, “‘you, you, you.”

The crowd on the W&L side of
the court were only a few feet
out of bounds and any unfor-
tunate Maroon that drifted to
the sideline became the object
of unmitigated heckling. The ef-
fects were unmistakeable. This
was the contribution of the sixth
man.

Roanoke maintained its com-
posure though, and despite the
inspired play of the Generals
the game remained constantly
within one or two points. As the
clock ticked towards the half
the crowd quieted and the
Maroons carried a one point
lead into the locker room with
them.

The sixth man was off the
bench and back on the court for
the start of the second half. The

mussea everything and one had
to suspect the potency of the
unknown fans half-time wham-
my. After four quick
unanswered points the stands
trembled with the same noise
level as the game’s beginning.

The referee made a ques-
tionable travelling call and the
sixth man cries, bulls--t in a
hundred defiant shouts. I
wonder what it is like to have a
guy with a black and white
striped paper bag over his head
point at you and scream.

As a one/point lead ticked
back and fourth on the
scoreboard the fans yelled
“defense’’ with the precision of
an army boot camp platoon. On
an out of bounds ball the referee
pointed toward the Generals’
end and hundreds of arms in the
stands did the same.

As the drama built in the clos-
ing seconds of the game, the
crowd stood and seemingly
refused Roanoke’s last shot of
dropping in. With the W&L re-
bound and time run out, the
sixth man poured onto the court
in a sea of jubilance.

Not to take away from Coach
Verne Canfield’s Generals.
Their game could not have been
improved upon and their
stature under the pressure is
beyond many of us. But rarely
does one witness such a
demonstration of undying and
inspiring loyalty. So to each of
the 1,133 present, whether you
had a bag over your head or not,
good game.

The Washington & Lee indoor
track program gets under way
this weekend with the running
of the Virginia Tech relays. The
team which sports an unusually
large 33 members has been
practicing for three weeks in
preparation for this week’s
meet. Although the V.P.1. meet
is an invitational and only a
select few from the squad will
attend, Head Coach Norris
Aldridge and Weight Event
Coach Frank Mirello stressed
the importance of getting an
early start. In fact since the in-
-|door season is only four meets
long, its main purpose is that of
/a warm-up for the outdoor
sai,

This does not mean that the
indoor season is treated any
‘less seriously. The indoor
| 0.D.A.C. championships are be-
‘ing held in Lexington for the
first time and W&L hopes to
capture its first indoor cham-
pionship. Stiff competition
should be provided.

By defending champion
Bridgewater and Lynchburg
College, W&L will bring defen-
ding indoor champs Keith
Kadesky in the 60-yard dash
and shot put champ John
McKee into the meet. Other
strong contenders for individual
honors are captain Alan Ar-
mitage in the 60-yard high
| hurdles, Gene Fellin in the pole

vault, Angus McBryde and John
Kelefant in the mile and captain
Russ Rector in the triple and
long jump. In addition to these
veterans a strong group of
freshmen should contribute to
the Generals’ depth, an area
that has been lacking in past
years.

The home advantage of
V.M.I. Fieldhouse for the cham-
pionship could also be a
decisive factor. In the past the
championships have been held
in the Lynchburg College facili-
ty which features 150-yard un-
banked oval that proved dif-

ficult to run on without prior ex- |

posure to the surface. V.M.I.’s
superior 220-yard banked syn-
thetic track will hopefully
produce faster times especially
for the seasoned Generals.

In the wake of the W&L foot-
ball and water polo teams’
outstanding seasons and the
basketball squad’s fine showing
thus far, the indoor track team
hopes to join in the glory of one |
of W&L’s finest athletic years.
The ’82 squad has the talent and
depth to make a legitimate run
at the title but the indoor season
is a tricky one. The shorter
distances and cramped
quarters often leave favorites
susceptable to upsets.

The quest for the champion-
ship seems to be in good hands,
but only the tape and stop watch

will tell.

Swimmers Split Meets

by Andrew P. Hoppes
The W&L swimming team
broke even in its two meets over
the weekend, losing’ to Rich-
mond on the road and trouncing
Appalachain State at the V.M.I.

pool.

With the team’s record now
Standing at 2-3, Coach
Remillard believes a_  .500
record is a realistic goal for the
team. ‘We could go undefeated
the rest of the season or only
.500,”’ said Remillard. “It just
depends on how much the swim-
mers want it. All our meets
from now on are going to be
close.”’

In the three years Remillard
has coached at W&L, the team’s
record has steadily improved.
In Remillard’s first two years
the team was 1-10 and 3-7. These
records were compiled against
primarily Division I and Divi-
sion II teams which are com-
posed of scholarship athletes.

Remillard also emphasizes
that his team makes tremen-
dous_ sacrifices, particularly
social ones, in order to compete.
Remillard stated that ‘over
Christmas break, the team
swam the equivalent of the

Chgere Move Into Second Place

The shot went up. At first it
looked short, way short. But
somehow it managed to hit the
front of the rim. It then took a
high bounce into the air and hit
the back of the rim. It rebound-
ed forward and once again hit
the front of the rim. Then, after
what seemed an eternity, it fell
through the net to give the
Washington and Lee basketball
team a 62-61 victory over
Roanoke College last Thursday
night.

The shot: a 15-fouer from
just beyond the foul line. The
shooter: senior point guard
George Spears. Time left: 8
seconds. Coach Verne Can-
field’s reaction: ‘‘We have no
set plan for that situation. We
just try to get as good a shot as
possible. Spears’ takes
responsibility —he wants to take
that type of shot.”’

The Generals also defeated
Lynchburg College 77-74 and
Eastern Mennonite 84-74 to up
their record to 11-4, 5-2 in the
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference, where they are the sole
possessors.of second place.

Spears, who finished with 12
points, had been held scoreless
throughout the entire second
half by Roanoke’s box-and-one
defense. Until the last 28
seconds, that is. At that point,
he hit a jumper from the right
side to cut the Maroons’ lead to
one, 62-61.

Roanoke then missed the

iruut end of a l-and-1, Brian
Hanson pulled down the re-
bound and threw the outlet pass
to Spears, who dribbled upcourt
for his game-winning shot.
Roanoke managed to get off a
shot before the buzzer, but it
was off the mark and Frank Ep-
pes got the rebound.

The see-saw battle saw the

~ lead change hands 18 times, and

the biggest lead by either team
was six, by W&L, 12-6. The key
to the game, according to Can-
field, was the fact that the
Generals outrebounded
Roanoke 42-25. John Lee Graves
had 11 boards, Hanson 9, and
Eppes 8.

Hanson led the club with 16
points, and Graves added 14,
but the squad only shot 43.5%
from the floor and 61.5% from
the foul line.

Canfield expressed delight at
the turnout (1133) for the con-
test. “‘We are extremely pleas-

   

ed with the crowd’s effort and
really appreciate their con-
tribution to our success. It was
a very definite positive factor,”’
he said.

Graves’ tap-in with two
seconds remaining gave the
Generals their second last-:

minute victory in a row and
their first road win of the season

over Lynchburg 77-74. Hanson
then hit two technical free
throws after the Hornets were
called for an illegal pick on the
inbounds play to ice the game.

Lynchburg took the early
lead, was up 47-38 at halftime
and 53-40 with 17:36 to go. ‘‘We
were a little flat coming off the
Roanoke game,” admitted Can-
field. ‘‘But we had a severe talk
session at half-time, and the
team responded beautifully.
They kept believing they could
come back.”

A highlight of the game was

distance between here and
Charlottesville in practice.”

Despite the team’s dedica-
tion, it does not receive much
fan support. “The only dif-
ference between the gallery
now and during a meet is that
during a meet the lights are
on,” stated Remillard, pointing
to an expanse of empty
bleachers above the pool.

In last weekend’s meets,
W&L did not employ a “strong
line-up”? against Richmond so
as to preserve the strength of
the squad for the more impor-
tant meet with Appalachain
State. Encouraged by their
strong performance despite the
irregular line-up against Rich-
mond, the swimmers totally
dominated the Appalachain
State team, which was ranked
in the top 10 nationally for Divi-
sion II.

Of this weekend’s two meets,
Remillard views Saturday’s
meet at home with William and
Mary as the most interesting.
“William and Mary should be

Looking forward to the NCAA

strength is that W&L swimmers
occupy ten positions on the Divi-

not is ranked in three events,
Tim Rock in two events, Rand

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

 

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

F.Y.1.

A cartoon in a past issue of the Phi has evoked cries
of racism. We would like to take this moment to clear
up a few discrepancies. The cartoon, as drawn by
Markham Pyle, was not meant as a slur on Washing-
ton and Lee blacks. The idea was to emphasize how a
reggae band would be a departure from W&L’s usual
entertainment.

We deeply regret that the cartoon was
misunderstood. In no way did we mean to offend the
black students on this campus. Unfortunately, it
seems that our attempt to lampoon the S.A.B.’s
choice in music has ended up in some deep mis-
understandings. Again, we apologize for any grief this
may have caused and hope that our critics unders-
tand that in no way did we intend for the cartoon to of-
fend any minorities.

Purpose

Let us take this moment to thank the student body
for footing Arthur Miller’s speaking fee. If the 120-odd
people at Mr. Miller’s Tuesday night speech had split
his fee of $2,000, the cost would have been $15 apiece.
For those who attended, Miller was good entertain-
ment. He gave an interesting speech and the crowd

laughingly approved his interrogation of 11 student-
jurors.

In the past few years, Contact has pulled off its
share of flops. Without a strong reputation and too
many other distractions on Tuesday nights — bands
in the Cockpit, parties down the road and basketball
games — lesser-known speakers such as Arthur
Miller are doomed to smaller audiences.

Yet even if students were guaranteed of enlightened
discussion, they would still likely avoid Contact. Some
faculty members have long noted an inability on the
part of students to engage their minds outside the
classroom.

A sense of mission is necessary to a small school.
Dr. Sidney Coulling devoted his Founder’s Day
speech to discussing the mission of a liberal-arts in-
stitute, and where was most of the student body?--out
trying to get some lunch.

We cannot offer any real solution for Contact’s pro-
blem. One person suggested moving speeches to
another night. Monday night is out because the
theatres show films for half-price. Wednesday nights
are dominated by fraternity parties and Thursdays

are set aside for going down the road. We won’t even
discuss the weekend.

When asked how to corréct the faults of the media,
Arthur miller replied that he had no real plan. He said
he believed the answer could be found ‘‘in society
moving forward highly sensitized to the problem.”
We at Washington and Lee need to be sensitized to the
problem of our school’s lack of intellectual mission

and, in small ways, should work to correct the situa-
tion.

Even $67 million cannot buy us a purpose.

Foreign Study Program Offered

by Bruce Jones

Washington and Lee students
interested in study abroad have
the opportunity to forego the
usual European adventures and
spend a year in the British
Crown Colony of Hong Kong as
participants in the annual ex-
change program with Chung
Chi College.

Few other undergraduate in-
stitutions offer their students a
similar chance to experience
first-hand a meeting of East
and West such as exists in Hong
Kong, where _ traditional
Chinese society endures in the
face of ever-growing European
and American influences.

Located some ten miles from
Victoria Island in Hong Kong’s
mountainous New Territories,

Cold-Weather Complaint

Dear Sir:

As winter continues to burden
us with its frozen, snowy
crystals I find myself somewhat
hampered in my efforts to walk
safely around campus. While
only mildly irritated at first,
I’ve become increasingly ag-
gravated over the slippery,
treacherous conditions of our
walkways and_ sidewalks.
Although I consider myself a
reasonably coordinated _ in-
dividual, I am_ nonetheless
reduced to the gait of a tottering
old man as I slip, stumble and
slide into class each day. While
the Sun and a smattering of
graveling have made many of
the walkways navigable, there
still remain many precarious
and unavoidable ice-laden spots
simply waiting to trip up any
and all who must walk over
them. Can we not do something

term loosely) from Newcombe

And Not A
Penny For
Hot Water

Dear Sir:

I was very fascinated during
Lee’s birthday convocation to
learn that Washington and Lee
University has within the past
ten years come into contact
with $67-million. As I sat and
mused over this inconceivable
figure I pondered the source of
such a sum.

Then in a moment of revela-
tion I was struck by a theory
which I quickly wrote down to
submit to investigative re-
porters of the Phi so they could
check it out.

Here itis:

A substantial part of this
wealth obviously must have
been gained by cutting and
hoarding funds which in
previous years were used to
supply hot water for the
showers of the freshman
dorms!

Get to it guys.

Reflections:

Living In Big Lex

Let it not be said that
Washington and Lee isn’t ex-
tremely unique from other
higher learning institutions in
this country — its smallness, its
maleness, its remoteness, its
wealth and the fact that Robert
E, Lee’s bones rest here make it
indeed quite different.

Unique as well is the 19th cen-
tury town in which the school is
located — our Lexington.

The character of the town has
probably remained propor-
tionately the same for many
decades — a core of working
class and rednecks, a handful of
moneyed aristocrats, academi-
cians and military types at-

from its many different drafts,
all of which tried to stress cer-
tain ideas.

Truman’s speech supposedly
was aimed at defending his un-
popular decision to replace
General Douglas MacArthur as
head of the American troops in
Korea. Ryan, however, con-
tends that the speech was poor-
ly conceived, as it did not clear-
ly explain why MacArthur was
fired.

The fact that MacArthur’s
policy was insubordinate, in the
sense that he was opposed to
Truman’s desire to limit the

war to Korea and not extend it
further, never really came
through in the final, watered-
down version of the speech.
Professor Ryan concludes that
the speech was not a success
because Truman never really
told the public why he fired
MacArthur.

published in a major journal,

W&L scored the first six
points of the game and never
trailed in the game, shooting a
blistering 64% from the field in
the first half to the Royals’
43.3%. Spears and Graves led
five players in double figures
with 19 points apiece, and Yates
added 16, Hanson 15 and Eppes
10.

Entering the Mennonite
game, Spears was leading the
ODAC in free throw shooting at
86.0% (now 84.7%), and Graves
was third at 82.9% (now 81.5%).
Hanson, who is shooting 86.7%,
did not qualify because he had
not made enough free throws.
The team is 77.5% from the
charity stripe, tops in the con-
ference.

Graves currently leads the
squad in both scoring and re-
bounding with averages of 15.5

and 7.2, respectively. Hanson is
second in both categories at 13.1
and 6.7.

The number of motor vehicle

displayed little change over last
year other than new evidence of
a declining trend in the number
of accidents during the past
three years. The cost of the

23 percent to almost $40,000.
This figure is even more shock-

two sides of the issue and that
the matter requires lengthy

I.F.C., but also from the
aculty-composed Student Af-
airs Committee and the
University Council, consisting
f faculty and students alike.

Amid this recent deliberation,
he Executive Committee has

as well. Said E.C. President,
Eric Myers, “It is our duty to

that the E.C.’s position in the
matter will be to assist the
I.F.C. in searching for. a solu-
tion to the problem. ‘‘We are not
taking an active role other than
encouraging the I.F.C. to study
the system further.”’

Although discussion has
reached only limited stages as
of yet, the L.F.C. plans to ex-
amine the situation in more
detail next month. According to
Vetterlein, the I.F.C. must
‘start at the bottom.” Once the
council has studied the issue
thoroughly and devised its
recommendations, the matter
will be sent to the Student Af-
fairs Committee and to the
University Council for addi-
tional analysis.

 

 

EC

(continued from page 1)

“Having two representatives
involved in the case gives direc-
tion,” stated E.C. Secretary
Bennett Ross. ‘Without this
direction, only the president is
aware of the case and he, in ef-
fect, becomes the prosecution.”

Ben Hale, ’8 Rep., said ‘a
valuable role is played by the
investigators. They know and
help direct the case.” Griffith
responded the investigators
form a subjective opinion about
some witnesses. ‘Minor pre-
judices shift the burden of proof
to the defendant.”

E.C. President Eric Myers

asked Griffith to explain what
he meant by minor. ‘How
minor is minor, when you’re
messing with someone’s
academic career,” replied Grif-
fith.

Tom Booher, first-year Law
Rep., thought the representa-
tion issue was as strong as the
honor system issue. “I don’t
understand only one freshman
representative from the largest

class, as well as only two from
the. law school, which has three
distinct classes.’’

“Freshmen are brand-new to
the school,” stated Kreshmen
Rep. Cole Dawson. “‘It is impor-
tant to have more communica-
tion with the freshmen, as one
rep. cannot know all his class.”’

Myers commented the fresh-
man class has more members
than the entire law school. The

freshman class has 374
members; the law school has
only 347.

Ken Lang, ’82 Rep., stated the
law school has two represen-
tatives, despite three classes,
because it is close to equal
representation. An average
class at W&L has about 340
students.

‘The honor issue is import-

ant, but the class most cheated
is the freshman class,’’ stated
Hale. “This is the only concen-
trated class — they live and eat
together.”’ Ross added “‘half of
our job involves the Honor
System. There is no class

representation there.”’

Dawson mentioned an alter-
native proposal. ‘‘Add an addi-
tional freshman and law school
rep., but Jet the investigative
team sit on the hearings.”’

John Vlahoplus, ’83 Rep., mo-
tioned that the discussion be
tabled until next week. The
issue was too important to be
decided in one night. The mo-
tion carried 9-3, Myers, Ross

and Lang opposed. ~

Computer Club President Jay
O’Brien appeared before the
E.C. on the issue of allowing
computer science courses be
counted in math and science
distributions. ‘“‘New courses
and machines have been add-
ed,” stated O’Brien, ‘and I
definitely think they qualify for
distribution credit. All ‘the
courses I’ve been involved with
include math.”

Myers said he would continue
to look into the issue, and
possibly come up with a recom-
mendation to the General
Education Committee.

VOLUME LXXXI Washington and Lee erry

Lexington. Virginia February 4, 1982. NUMBER 17,

President Hundley Announces Resignation

Robert E. R. Huntley, presi-
dent of Washington and Lee
University. since 1968, an-
nounced at a faculty meeting
Monday that he will resign from
his position effective at the end
of 1982.

Huntley, 52, said that he had
made his decision known to
W&L’s board of trustees as far
back as October, 1981. James
M. Ballenge, rector of the
university’s board of trustees,
said he was saddened by
Huntley’s decision, adding that
Huntley “had been the most
outstanding president of
Washington and Lee since
Robert E. Lee.”

In an interview Monday after-
noon, President Huntley con-
firmed that his decision was
based on his belief that ‘‘prin-
cipal things had been achieved”’
during his tenure. Huntley add-
ed that he decided to keep his
decision confidential since Oc-
tober in order to guarantee that
the last phases of the school’s
ten-year, $67-million develop-
ment plan would be a success.

Under university procedure,
an advisory committee com-
posed of faculty members will
consider candidates before the
trustee board makes a decision.
Huntley noted that the faculty
advisory committee met last
Monday to consider ways of
relating the procedure to both
students and alumni organiza-
tions..

With Feb. 5 marking the 14th
year of his tenure as president,
Huntley, in a letter to alumni,
faculty and friends of the
university said, ‘‘quite simply, I
feel I have been in the job long
enough.”’

Huntley was named president
of Washington and Lee on Jan.
3, 1968, but did not officially
enter office until Feb. 5. He is

the 20th president of -Wash-
ington and Lee and the seventh
successor of Robert E. Lee.

A 1950 graduate of Wash-
ington and Lee, Huntley was the
first alumnus to serve as the
university’s president since
pre-Civil War times.

Huntley said that when he
first became president of W&L, ©
the “hoped to assist in pro- |
viding financial needs, the ex- |
pansion of the curriculum and
the strengthening of the pursuit |, ;
of a liberal arts education.” ¢
Huntley said he also carried
“the hope to maintain and
strengthen the quality of the
student body.”

“‘Thave achieved as muchas I
can achieve,” said the presi-
dent. ‘‘The achievements that
have occurred here are quite
strong and commendable. It
seems to me that it’s time for a
new president.”’

Huntley has no definite plans
for the future, saying he would
be open to the possibility of
teaching again, but would make
no specific statements.

As for a successor, Huntley
made no predictions, but said
that the university should look
for someone with “academic
and administrative talents and
the ability to communicate.”’

Huntley noted that Wash-
ington and Lee is an especially
attractive job since “the at-
mosphere for the president is
pleasant. You’re not in the eye
of a storm, nor are there power
plays.”’

Following his graduation
from Washington and Lee,
President Huntley served for
three years in the U.S. Navy
before returning to W&L to
study law.

As a law student, he was
recognized as the senior who

Superdance °82 Collects Nearly $24,000

by Tom Baker
The Washington and Let
Muscular Dystrophy Dance-
athon, an annual event that has
become a source of pride for the
W&L community, raised a

record $23,882 this past
weekend.
Approximately 140 people

danced from Friday night to
early Sunday morning in Evans
Dining Hall this past weekend.
Superdance chairman Tripp
Brower was appreciative of
everyone’s efforts, expressing
thanks “‘to everyone who con-

hall), who did so much for us
like always.”

Grade Inflation:

by Scott Kennedy

In the past decade SAT scores
have dropped while the grade-
point-average of many colleges
has risen. Educational experts
cast the blame for this on grade
inflation.

Grade Inflation, the tendency
of professors to give higher
grades, is said to have started
during the turmoil of the sixties.
Many anti-war professors
realized that giving poor grades
lowered the chances of male
students attempting to enter
graduate programs thus allow-
ing them to be drafted.

Since many public institu-
tions were forced at the time to
admit minorities, they hesi-
tated to issue disheartening
grades.

It is the general attitude of the
Washington and Lee University
administration that grade infla-
tion is not currently present
here and never has been.

The Grade Point Average of
the student body at Washington
and Lee for the past two
decades has risen only slightly.
It rose from a 2.5 average in
1963-64 to 2.7 in 1979-1980. The
percentage of A’s doubled in
that same period, however.

Dean William Watt has con-
tributed this increase to the fact
that ‘‘some students are study-

ing more intensively than
before.”” Watt believes that
more students are attempting
to go on to graduate schools.
Dean Waitt also accounted the
increase to the change in the

“Grade inflation was a problem in the

70’s, but you don’t hear much about it
Dean William Watt

anymore.”

 

Another factor was the
liberalizing of the education.
Since many teachers received
evaluations from their students,
they attempted to earn a good
review by giving higher grades.

In the mid-1970’s, grade infla-
tion had reached epidemic pro-
portions. Many schools tried to
curb the problem. At University
of North Carolina, for example,
the number of A’s doubled be-
tween 1962 and 1972. A U.N.C.
dean reacted by sending a letter
to the department heads asking
them to keep grades down.
Grades thus began to drop.

There is a faction inside the
educational community, how-
ever, which defends grade infla-
tion. This group argues that
grading each student on the
same scale is unfair. In their
view grade inflation gives each
student the same opportunity to
get an A. These educationists
say that giving lower grades
does not raise standards.

curriculum in 1970. The altera-
tion eliminated some required
courses and thus allowed
students to enroll in courses
they would prefer out of choice,

not obligation.
Van Pate, the Assistant
Director of Admissions,

believes that the coincidence in
the rises of percentages of both
F’s and A’s indicates that W&L
is admitting more good and
poor students and less average
students.

amount of participants.
Only eight to ten dancers did
not finish the danceathon.

Michael Wyatt, ’82, was the
dancer with the highest amount
of total pledges brought in
$1400. Kevin Gray, a third-year
law student, was second with
nearly $800 in pledges and
Amelia Mundin, with $480 in
pledges, was third. | ;

President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley spoke to the dancers at the
conclusion of the event, con-
gratulating the dancers on a job
well done. Noting that the dance
had become an_ established
event at W&L, Huntley ex-
pressed his hope that the event
would only improve.

According to Finance Chair-
man M. Shaw Pyle, the success

Does It

Dean Watt admits that in the
mid-1970's W&L did discuss the
problem. That was at the same
time when many other institu-
tions dealt with grade inflation.
Dean Watt, who was on a state

‘commission to investigate the
problem in Virginia, said
“grade inflation was a problem
in the 70’s but you don’t hear
much about it anymore.”

Many education officials
believe that grade inflation has
entered high schools as well as
colleges. According to Pate,
“an A at some schools is a C at
others.”

In an attempt to deal with
grade inflation among ap-
plicants, W&L tries to look at
both grade-percentage spreads
and grade percentiles. The Ad-
missions Office also tries to look
at the high school’s record of
placing its graduates in college.

When a student graduates
from college and applies for a
position with a company, does
the company take grade infla-
tion into account? According to

‘Mike Cappeto, University
Placement Director,

to look more closely at the in-
dividual’s character. Although
grades are of course important
to a point but companies don’t
try to decipher the grade infla-
tion at the school.

of the danceathon was ensured,
despite the lower-than-expected
turnout of dancers, by the large
number of people who came to
hear the bands.

On both Friday and Saturday
nights, Evans Dining Hall was
filled with a maximum at 750
persons. With 12 hours of
capacity crowds, “‘the money
was made at the band and at the
gate,”’ according to Pyle. Pyle
estimated that, because people
had to be turned away, ‘‘$50-
$100-a-minute in revenues were
lost because tickets couldn’t be
sold when the cafeteria was
filled to capacity.”

Another successful portion of
the dance was a series of pie
throws in which the targets
were W&L faculty members.

Weaken

This event brought in a total of
$670. With a bid of $200, jour-
nalism professor Robert de

Maria was the most-coveted

target.

The main concern of those
associated with the dance is
now to collect all the money that
was pledged. With a collection
rate between 80 and 90-percent,
Pyle estimates that, after all
the bills are paid, the Super-
dance could net as much as
$18,000, all of which goes to the
M.D. national organization.

Exemplifying the continuing
success of the event, several
people have suggested that
Superdance ’83 be moved to the
gym so that there will be more
room for dancers and spec-
tators.

E.C. Rejects Three Proposals
For Adding Two New Members

by Ben Jarratt
The Executive Committee re-
jected three proposals Monday
night that would have added one
or two new members to this
body.

Two weeks ago, Third Year -

Law Rep. Morgan Grittith in-
troduced a plan that would have
added a second year law
representative and an addi-
tional one from the freshmen
class. The honor system func-
tions of the E.C. would have
changed slightly.

Griffith's plan would increase
the number of representatives
to 14. The honor system changes
would prevent the two members
of the investigating team from
sitting in on an honor violation
hearing.

After debating the issue at the
two previous meetings, Griffith
motioned for the constitutional
changes involving the addi-
tional representatives be ac-
cepted, along with a rider that
the committee would look into
the honor system changes.

The motion was defeated 2-9.
Griffith and Frank Smith, ‘83
Rep., voted in favor; Tripp
Brower, '82 Rep., was absent.

Freshman Rep. Cole Dawson
then motioned that the constitu-
tional changes be accepted,
without any consideration of
changing the honor system.

Ken Lang, '82 Rep., objected
to increasing the E.C. by one or
two members. ‘It comes to a
point where this body can’t
function.”’

Griffith commented it would
be fairer to have another
freshmen and law school rep.
Each law class would have its
own representative and elec-
tions would be easier to con-
duct.

E.C. President Eric Myers
stated that the ultimate reason
for only two law school reps.
was “to get a_ proportional

representation of the law
school, in order to be judged by

 

their peers. This proportion is
the basis of the honor system.”’

Dawson’s motion failed, 5-6.
Dawson, Griffith, Smith, First
Year Law Rep. Tom Booher
and John Viahoplus, ’83 Rep.
voted in favor of the proposal.

Griffith then moved that only
an additional freshmen
representative be added to the
E.C. Myers stated it was best
not to tinker with the system if
there was no problem to ad-
dress.

The motion was also rejected,
5-6. Dawson, Griffith, Smith,
Booher and Vlahoplus voted in
favor.

In other matters, the E.C.
heard a report from the Student
Activities Board. Co-chairman
John Martin said the S.A.B.
made a couple of investments
for Fancy Dress, which _ in-
creased the budget. He men-
tioned a $2,500 ceiling cover for
Doremus Gym as an example.

Martin said the W&L Alumni
Magazine has come out with an
article on this year’s Ball. A
concert has not yet been
booked, as Martin stated there
is no justification in wasting
$15,000 on second-rate talent.

The co-chairman added that
Jerry Darrell, director of food
services, was pleased with the
success of the Reggae Party
held in Evans Dining Hall. Dar-
rell has indicated his support
for future concerts.

S.A.B. Treasurer Randall
Jacoby reported the Films
Committee lost money because
of a poor lineup of movies. On
The Yard cost $350; but grossed
only $9 at the door. ‘‘It was a no-
name movie, with no-name ac-
tors,’ stated Jacoby. ‘‘I told the
films chairmen, Don Richard-
son and Rusty Lee, not to order
.

University Committee Chair-
man Bob Schmidt said revenues
have picked up in the Cockpit as
a result of ‘‘Tuesdays’ "’ enter-
tainment; labor costs have also

been held down. This has helped
the Cockpit run Happy Hours on
Thursdays and Fridays.

Martin added that the Cockpit
recently presented a $500 check
to the S.A.B. for entertainment.
The two groups try to work
together in this area.

Griffith commented on the
treacherous sidewalk condi-
tions at the law school and gym
over the past two weeks. He felt
the school did not do enough to
clear the sidewalks of ice. He
mentioned that if a lawsuit
arose, the university is legally
not responsible.

Myers added the same condi-
tions existed around the main
campus. The committee would
point this problem out to the
university.

F. Lee Bailey, who has gained
national prominence as the
defense attorney in such
celebrated cases as Dr. Sam
Sheppard, The _ Boston
Strangler, Capt. Ernest Medina
and Patty Hearst, will speak at
Washington and Lee University
on Thurs., Feb. 4.

Bailey’s speech will be at 8
p.m. in W&L’s Lee Chapel. It is
open to the public. Admission is
free. Bailey is the fourth
speaker this academic year in
the university’s Contact pro-
gram, a_ visiting speakers’
forum sponsored jointly by the
interfraternity council and the
student body.

A self-professed ‘‘renegade”’
who claims that specializing in
criminal law “makes me a
rebel by profession,” Bailey has
often suggested that his unor-
thodox route to the criminal bar
is one reason for his success.

‘Modern Problems’

Review:

A Woeful

by Todd Jones

Modern Problems is Chevy
Chase’s latest comedy venture.
The cast includes such excellent
comedians as Patti D’Arbin-
ville, Brian Doyle-Murray,
Dabney Coleman, and Nell
Carter. Even these talented ac-
tors could not make Modern
Problems a winner, however.

Modern Problems certainly
does not have a_ poignant
message. The plot revolves
around a man, (Chevy), who ac-
cidentally is exposed to radioac-
tive waste. He finds he is
telekinetic and starts moving
things wherever he _ pleases.

From cups and mugs to ballet
dancers, to stuffed animals. His
girlfriend is in the process of
leaving him, but still feels a cer-
tain something. They decide to
go to a beachhouse which is
owned by one of Chase’s high
school buddies. The buddy, con-
fined to a wheelchair after the
Vietnam War, is spending the
weekend at the beachhouse with
Chase’s ex-wife. Add to this
group an egotistical author of
sex manuals and a housemaid
from Port-Au-Prince, and the
final scenes are ready to be
played to a climax.

The major problem with

Modern Problems is that there
is not enough funny material.
Chase can only make things
move for so long and then the
routine gets old. Because of
this, Chase spends a lot of time
making strange faces. -The
faces are funny the first time,
but rarely do they entertain on
the seventh.

Brian Doyle-Murray rolls
through the film in a part that
seems to be custom-made for
George Carlin. He even looks
like Carlin. His part is not only
an uninteresting one, but it has
no relationship to the plot.

Fifth in this year’s Film
Society series is Robert
Bresson’s version of the King
Arthur legend, Lancelot of the
Lake (France, 1974: 85
minutes). Screenings will take
place free of charge on Friday
and Saturday, Feb. 5 and 6, at 8
p.m. in Lewis Hall ‘‘A.”

An important figure in
French cinema since the 1940’s,
Bresson has directed The

Country Priest (1950),
Pickpocket (1959), Au Hasard,
Balthasar (1966), Mouchette
(1966), and Four Nights of a
Dreamer (1971). His movie A
Condemned Man _ Escaped

and stylized Lancelot, which
won prizes at the Cannes and
New York film festivals,
represents a departure from the
spectacular treatment accord-
ed the Arthurian legend in
several recent films. Scenes in
the movie recall the work of the
surrealist painter Magritte, and
reveal an interest in states of
weightlessness.

Arthur’s vision of a perfect
society at Camelot is Edenic; it
snatches out of time a golden
moment of perfect harmony
between man and man, and
man and the land. Bresson’s
autumnal treatment focuses on
events in the myth’s final
stages. We see the decimation
of Arthur’s Knights of the

The Cockpit ‘Tellurides’ This Friday

Vhe following article is reprinted
from the Birmingham  Post-
Herald Kudzu of Friday, Feb. 1,
1980.

FRIDAY NIGHT.

For many it means heading
for a smoky barroom, ordering
a cold one and slumping :into a
seat for the night to put their
feet up and let their hair down.

But drinking isn’t enough to
satisfy most. They want music.
And for that there are bar
bands.

And what is a bar band? It is
simply, a working-man’s band.
The members aren’t on any
worldwide tour. They don't
show up in limousines. There
isn’t any caviar waiting for
them backstage, if there even is
abackstage.

They play more music in the
course of an evening than many
major groups play in a few days
of touring. And chances are,
they do it four times a week,
almost every week of the year,
for a fraction of the money.

Telluride is a band cut from
that cloth. Any given week you

can find them somewhere in
town. And when you can’t find
them in town, they’re probably
playing in some other city.

By bar band standards they
are relatively old — four years
some time this month. But they
have been through their share
of changes. Two of the original
band members have moved on
to other things. Their music has
switched from a country in-
fluence to a harder-edged rock
sound

One thing is constant.

They keep on playing.

“It’s very demanding,’’ said
“Moose” Harrell, a guitarist
and original member of the
band. “‘It’s hard to stay up all
the time.

‘You have to put out a lot of
energy to excite people. When
we go on break, for the first 15
minutes I’m a zombie.”’

The band got its start in the
friendship of Harrell and the
band’s other guitarist, Rick
Carter. The two started playing
together after meeting in
Mobile. Harrell was in school at

‘Modern Problems’

(continued from page 4)
Dabney Coleman plays the
same type of role he played in
Nine To Five. His part seems to
be in the film only because they
could get him in the film.

The one bright spot in the film
is Nell Carter. She plays a
superstitious maid who decides
that there is an evil spirit in
Chase, and she must combat it,
whether it be with demon dust
or with her bare knuckles. She
plays her part well, and she has

Even Nell Carter’s wonderful
performance cannot
save Modern Problems. The
failure of the film is in the
script, no matter how hard the
cast tries to make that not mat-
ter. In fact, they sometimes try
so hard that many scenes look
pushed.

Modern Problems is too slow
to be a comedy, too ridiculous to
be a satire or drama, and too
bad to be anything else.
Because of a poor dialogue a
good cast ends up with a poor
movie.

the time at the University of
South Alabama.

In the summer of ’75 the two
started a group, “mostly for
fun” called Highway. When
Harrell graduated in December
of that year he and Carter got
together the original Telluride
with Jim Liner on bass, Robert
Churchill on drums and Roger
Bailey on piano.

(The name comes from a city
in Colorado. It’s a streamlined
version of an old phrase — “‘To
hell you ride’’ — miners used to
describe trips to far-flung
spots. )

Unlike other bands in town
that play music in addition to
other jobs, Telluride has pur-
sued their music with the idea
of being full-time musicians.

And they are a success.

‘“‘We’ve pretty well covered
the state (as far as playing
goes),’’ said Carter. The band
has played Tuscaloosa, Mobile
and Auburn. “We've got a good
following.’

So good, in fact, that Harrell

Telluride will play in the Cockpit this F day night.

said the band is in the position
that ‘“‘we really don’t have to
compete with anybody in the ci-
ty. “We have to turn down
dates.”’

The band even has a good
working relationship with
another band that has a con-
siderable following in town
—Hotfoot. ‘‘We’re one big fami-
ly,” Harrell notes. The two
trade equipment as well as play
together under the name Hot-
pride.

Harrell likes to think of

Telluride as ‘‘a people’s band.”’
He thinks that separates them
from bigger ‘“‘concert bands”’
that play a show and then leave.

Not that the band wouldn’t
like to be a concert band
They’re working to that enc
now. Telluride currently has
about 12 original numbers that
they’d like to put on a new
album.

‘“‘We want to reach as many
people as we can,”’ said Harrell,
“which is really what it’s all
about.”’

Generals Gain Conference Lead ports

defense” looks for an inside

by G. Bruce Potter

This is undoubtedly a season
of parity for Old Dominion
Athletic Conference basketball,
so, as Washington and Lee Head
Coach Verne Canfield says,
“You better win at home and
hope for a split on the road.”’

And that’s exactly what his

, Generals have done as a home

victory over Maryville 62-60
kept their ODAC record in the
Warner Center unblemished
and a 73-69 overtime win at
Emory and Henry Tuesday
night evened their road record
at 2-2. Not coincidentally the
team moved into first place in
the conference with a 7-2 mark
(13-5 overall).

Junicr forward Jay Fechtel
hit both ends of a one-and-one fo
give W&L the lead for good over
Emory and Henry with 1:46 lett
in the overtime period. George
Spears added six points in the
extra session to spark the
squad.

With 2:19 left in the first half, °

the Generals took their biggest
lead of the game at 27-20 on a
bucket by Brian Hanson, who
led the squad with 22 points and
9 rebounds. However, the

Wasps rebounded for 10° un-
answered points and took a
30-27 lead with 17:12 remaining
in the game.

The Generals battled back to
take a 45-40 lead on a basket by
Spears, who finished with 19
points, with the clock showing
8:23. However, in action that
truly typified the see-saw strug-
gle (the lead changed hands 17
times), E&H came back to take
leads at 53-51 and 55-54.
However, John Lee Graves’
three-point play at 1:11 gave the
Generals a 57-55 edge. ;

Emory and Henry missed
their first attempt to tie the
game up, but managed to get
the rebound, call time out, and
knot the score at 57 when they
hit both ends of a one-and-one
following a Graves’ foul. Billy
Yates’ desperation 25-footer at
the buzzer was off the mark,
setting the stage for the over-
time.

Both teams shot well from the
floor, 62.2% for W&L and 57.1%
for the Wasps, and poorly from
the foul line, 68% and 55.5% ,
respectively.

The 62-60 squeaker over
Maryville typified Canfield

pass against Maryville.

W&L Swimmers Set ‘Best Times ’

by John M. Cleghorn

Washington and Lee swimmers continue to rank
as leaders in the nation, according to the latest
‘Best Times” standings. W&L men appear in six’
of the nine top-ten rankings for individual events
as a team, in both relay events. This widespread
appearance in national rankings is especially im-
pressive in light of the fact that there are 170 other
teams that compete on the Division III level.

Mike Bernot is again atop the 50-yard freestyle
list with a time of 21.21 seconds. Sophomore team-
mate Rand McClain follows closely with his own
time of 21.68. Bernot also leads the best-times list
for the 100-yard freestyle event as well as turning
in the fourth best time in the 200-yard free. Tim
Rock accompanies Bernot and McClain on the na-
tional level with a 4:48.57 time for the 500-yard
free style, which places him fourth in the nation.
Rock also swims the second-fastest 1,000-yard free
in Division III.

Sophomore Jeff Gee and junior Rob Crawford
are just off the Jan. 26 best times list in the 200-
yard backstroke and the 200-yard breast-stroke
respectively. Head Coach Page Remillard expects
both Gee and Crawford to move back up in the
times very soon.

The W&L 400-yard free style relay team holds
the number one position with a time of 3:43.46.
Also appearing in the relay standings, the 400-yard
medley relay team stands as number nine in the
nation. Looking forward to a restful break,

Remillard predicts that W&L can move into each
of the individual best-times lists before the end of
the season.

—“——_

Narrowing the focus to Old Dominion Athletic
Conference basketball, Washington and Lee has
moved into similar leading positions. As of games
through Feb. 4, W&L maintains the conference
lead with a record of 7-2 and holds the second best
overall record at 13-5 behind Roanoke at an im-
pressive 16-2.

As a teaiu, W&L ranked fifth in scoring offense,
second in scoring defense, had the second-highest
scoring margin and the second-highest rebound
margin in the conference in the Feb. 2 rankings.

Part of the key to W&L’s success has been con-
sistent shooting. In both free throws and field goal
attempts, Washington and Lee sat atop the ODAC.

In individual statistics, John Lee Graves was
tenth in scoring with 240 points in 17 games for a
14.1 average. Graves also holds the eighth spot in

tage, and the fourth-best free throw percentage.

Also in individual standings, Brian Hanson is

ference rebounding. Senior captain George Spears
leads the ODAC in free throw percentage making
60 of 70 attempts for an average of .857.

W&L committed 21 turnovers
and the Scots 16 in the mistake-
filled game. Maryville out-
scored the Generals over the
first four minutes of the second
half to take a 39-35 lead. But
Spears, who lead the squad with
16 points, scored five un-
answered points to give W&L a
45-43 lead with 11:41 remaining
and set the stage for an exciting
finish.

Maryville made a comeback
of their own and managed to
regain the lead at 55-52 with 5:12
left and 58-56 at the 2:38 mark.
Yates then made the first of two
defensive plays that swung the
game in the Generals’ favor.
Covering sharpshooter Bobby
Rimmer, he drew a charging
violation after the Generals had
committed one of their many:
turnovers, and then hit a
jumper from the left corner to
tie the contest at 58.

Following a Maryville travel-
ing call, Frank Eppes hit a turn-
around jumper from the
baseline to give W&L the lead
for good with only 1:26 left. Two
Spears’ tree throws at :36 seem-
ingly iced the victory. But Han-
son and Ken Jaffe missed the
front ends of one-and-ones, and
Maryville had a chance to force
overtime after rebounding
Jaffe’s miss with nine seconds
remaining.

But enter Yates once again.

Rimmer brought the ball
downcourt and was closely
guarded by the sophomore
guard. Hurried, he threw up a
desperation 18-footer at the
buzzer that missed everything.

“Billy (Yates) has been play-
ing our most intense defense,”’
said Canfield, who was also
upset at the amount of tur-
novers. ‘“‘When we create a tur-
nover situation, it disturbs me a
great deal. We must concen-
trate on not-causing our own
situation.”

The squad had opened the
week by suffering a 77-65 set-
back at the hands of Mary
Washington College. The Blue
Tide outrebound W&L 55-34, and
the Generals only shot 40%
from the floor. “It was a horren-
dous ball game which we
deserved to lose and Mary
Washington deserved to win,”
explained Canfield. ‘We were

their big game and we broke

down totally, both offensively
and defensively.

“We rushed, hurried and took
shots we shouldn’t have taken.
We don’t shoot well out of the
context of our offense. Also, the
crowd got into the game.”’

Canfield did praise his club,
however, in noting that they
never quit and cut what was
once a 24-point deficit down to
the final margin of 12 points.
“The fact that they bounced
back against Maryville showed
their strength,” he added.

Hanson led the team with 16
points, and Spears added 12.

The term “recruiting’’ often
brings to mind rule violations
and NCAA-imposed probations.
This is mostly due to the
media’s virtually exclusive
coverage of rule violators, even
though most schools operate
honestly.

Recruiting practices at’
Washington and Lee vary from
sport to sport. Head Football
Coach Gary Fallon and Head
Lacrosse Coach Jack Emmer
refer to recruiting as a ‘‘con-
tinual process,’ whereas head
basketball coach Verne Can-
field says the time he spends
recruiting is ‘‘all jammed up.”’

Although the basketball
recruiting program consists
mostly of letters, cards, and
telephone calls, rather than per-
sonal visits, Canfield says, ‘‘If
he’s a really good kid, I’ll make
every effort to go see him no
matter where he is — unless
he’s on the West Coast or
something like that.”

The track recruiting program
is similar, with Coach Norris
Aldridge travelling mainly
within the state of Virginia to
talk to prospects.

Lacrosse, however, is a dif- ~
ferent story.

Emmer is in charge of
lacrosse recruiting and is
assisted by Chuck O’Connell
and intern Eric Kemp. The
three of them will travel over
5,500 miles, visit over 190
schools, and meet with 600 to 700
prospects. In addition, many
prospects will visit W&L and

spend a weekend with a W&L
student athlete.

As David Burst of the NCAA
states, “There are numerous
differences between Division I
and Division III.” Perhaps

those differences are best sum- .” |

med up by Ken Weller, presi-
dent of Central College. ‘‘It can
be claimed that, in general,
Division I institutions place a
greater emphasis on ‘societal’
objectives, whereas Division III
institutions concentrate on ‘par-
ticipant’ objectives.’

Fallon supports this, saying
“all our sports are a service to
the student body.”

Although W&L is a Division
III school, the lacrosse team
competes in Division I. Emmer
explains: ‘Our philosophy
hasn’t changed a bit; it’s a Divi-
sion III philosophy all the way,
except we aspire to play Vivi-
sion I lacrosse.” W&L’s most ef-
fective recruiting tool in
lacrosse, according to Emmer,
is its summer lacrosse camp.

. Last year, 12 players from the

camp decided to come to school
here.

The Division III recruiting
rules are fairly simple. Basical-
ly they state that no athletic
scholarships may be given, and
that coaches cannot talk with
players below the 12th-grade
level.

As Canfield says, ‘‘The first

thing we indicate to a kid is, ‘We
( can’t give you anything but a

chance to earn an education and
a chance to play.’ We refuse to

¥4 say anything more than that. If

that kid is looking for something

‘more, he shouldn’t come to
_ Washington and Lee.”

It is clear that in recruiting
players, Canfield is looking for

A someone who will be happy at

W&L. In fact, when a prospect

*\ visits W&L, Canfield turns him

over to the players. ‘‘I tell him
(the prospect), ‘Hey, if you
don’t like these guys, don’t
come to Washington and Lee.’
We’re very open, very honest,
very blunt.”

This honesty is also reflected
in the letters Canfield sends out.
He notes that ‘‘we have a letter
we'll send out saying ‘Thanks
for your interest, but there’s no
way you can qualify.’ It saves a
lot of heartbreak, and it’s fair to
the kid.”

Fallon also relies heavily on
student/athletes in recruiting.
He tells his players that ‘‘if they
want good people on our football
team, they have to be the real
salesmen. Because after a

while, I’m sure we football
coaches all sound alike to a
prospect.’”’

Recruiting for a Division III
school is not trouble-free. Em-
mer compares the on-the-road
recruiting to “missionary work
— you wind up putting some of
your own bucks into the effort.’’

The size of the school can also
be a problem. While it is true
that the school’s small size
makes the university attractive
to many students, it also tends
to make it less visible, less
known.

As Emmer comments, ‘‘Pros-
pects are just not going to walk
onto the campus; they’re not
going to just show up. We’ve got
to go out and make sure they’re
aware of our lacrosse program,
our academic programs —
because they’re good ones —
and sell the university.”

Canfield commented on the
problem of competing for
players against schools which
offer athletic scholarships: ‘I
think you have to realize in
recruiting for Washington and
Lee that you’re not going to get
a blue-chip prospect. So you set-
tle for a super kid. We look for
special people who are willing
to work at the game, pay the
price, and work up to a certain
point...so when they graduate,
they’re about the best player
they can be.”’

Emmer voices a similar opi-
nion: “If you're trying to

recruit a guy who’s getting a
full ride (full scholarship) at
U.Va. and U.N.C.’ chances are

W&L Recruiting: Stress On ‘Participant Objectives’

that you’re not going to be com-
petitive — although we'll give it
our best shot and sell a good,
academic, personal universi-

None of the coaches inter-
viewed saw any problems with
the current Division III rules
and only Emmer suggested a
change. Emmer said that he
would like to see the NCAA
eliminate all on-the-road
recruiting. All recruiting under
Emmer’s suggestion would be
done by mail and by telephone
and through student visits to the
various campuses. Coach
Fallon opposed this suggestion,
saying ‘‘If you just left it all to
mailing and telephone calls, it
would become a very imper-
sonal thing. I think we would be
at a disadvantage... I really feel
our sports would suffer.’’

Of course the most important
facet of recruiting is the pro-
spect himself. In the course of
researching this. article, two
high school seniors currently
being recruited by W&L and a
W&L sophomore who was re-
cruited to play soccer were in-
terviewed. All three students
wished to remain anonymous.

The first prospect is being
recruited to run track by W&L,
U.Va. and William and Mary.
The recruit said that W&L
“didn’t really recruit” him. He
just stopped. by Norris
Aldridge’s office one afternoon
and Aldridge explained the pro-
gram to him.

When asked about the
possibilities of athletic scholar-
ships at other schools, the
recruit replied, “‘The coach at
William and Mary said that if I
would agree to go there — and if
I ran a 1:52 half-mile — he
would give me a full ride. That’s
bull st. If I decide to go to
William and Mary, I want a
scholarship before I start run-
ning.”

The recruit is not sure about
whether he wants a full ride or
not, though. “I don’t like the
pressure of an athletic scholar-
ship,” he said. “If you run a
couple of bad meets, your food
ticket gets cut.”

The recruit is still not sure
where he will end up. He ex-
plained his basis for making his
decision, though. “If I go to
U.Va., it will be because they
have such a good team; if I go to
W&L, it will be strictly for the
academics; if I go to William
and Mary, it’s because they’ll
give me a full ride.”’

The second prospect is being

 

recruited to run cross-country
and has been impressed with
Coach Dick Miller’s recruiting.
In fact, W&L was the only
school to send him information
on cross-countrybefore he ap-
plied.

The second recruit is apply-
ing to the University of
Virginia, and Yale in addition to
W&L. He says, ‘‘Nobody’s con-
tacted me from Virginia. After I
applied to Yale, I got a form
from their athletic department
to fill out and send back. Coach
Miller sent me a short letter and
an information card...he was
way ahead of the people .at
Yale.”

As another example, a
sophomore soccer player at
W&L was also contacted by
W&L’s athletic department
before he applied. He was con-
sidering the University of
Delaware, Bucknell, Muehlen-
berg College, and Haverford

College his senior year in col-
lege. He says he “‘had not even
thought about W&L.’’ Coach
Rolf Piranian, however, sent
him four letters and a catalogue
and W&L became his first
choice. In fact, he says, ‘Coach
Piranian was the deciding in-
fluence.”

Recruiting is a very

unpredictable part of athletics,
Money, academics, and size can
all play a big role in which
schools get which players. Even
after a prospect is enrolled, he
may not participate. As Coach
Miller says, ‘‘I don’t count on
anybody until they are suited-
up and running.”’

Swimmers Rise

by Andrew P. Hoppes

W&L’s swim team upped its
record to 3-4 over the weekend,
losing to Shippensburg State
and defeating William and
Mary.

In the 66-47 loss to Ship-
pensburg, the Generals lost the
400-yard medley relay, an event
they usually win. Mike Bernot,
forced by circumstances to
swim in an event he usually
does not swim, scored only
twice instead of his usual three
times.

Coach Page Remillard
pointed out two other factors
which contributed to Friday’s
loss. ‘‘We got beat by our finger-
nails a couple times despite the
fact we turned in some good
times.”’

Remillard also stated that
‘“‘we didn’t get the kind of per-
formances from our number-
two men that we should have.”

The Generals turned things
around against William and
Mary on Saturday with a con-
vincing 64-49 win. This time it

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team, which went 1-2
in last weekend’s competition,
will participate this Saturday in
the inaugural Davidson College
Invitational at Davidson, N.C.

Action in the eight-team event
begins at9 a.m.

“This Invitational will be a
new experience for us and a few
other teams,”’ said Head Coach
Gary Franke. ‘‘Most wrestling
tournaments feature head-to-
head competition by the in-
dividual athletes in each of the
ten weight classes. But this
event will use competition
among teams. There will not be
any weight classes titles.”’

The Generals will square off
against Catawba College in the
first-round. The victor of that
match will face the winner of

was William and Mary’s, not
W&L’s, top swimmer who pick-
ed up points in only two events
while the Generals benefitted
from superb efforts from their
second men.

Mike Bernot’s outstanding
performance provided the most
exciting moments in the meet.
In the 400-yard medley relay,
Bernot made up substantial
time to pull out an exciting vic-
tory for W&L.

Bernot also posted firsts in
two other events in the meet.

One man whose contributions
often go unnoticed by the public
is Junior Bob Marshall. Mar-

shall, until this season a
freestyler, volunteered for
emergency service as_ the

Generals’ diver. Although new
to the event, Marshall con-
sistently scores one point in the
event and he also ‘‘adds an ele-
ment of motivation to the
team,’’ as Remillard noted.
‘He plays a significant role,”’
Remillard concluded.

“With the exception of

same teams which participated
in our Invitational two weeks
ago,” said Franke. Catawba,
Elon and Pfeiffer finished first,
second and third, respectively,
in the W&L event. The Generals
earned fourth place.

W&L will be bringing a 2-5

In last weekend’s action, W&L

‘‘We should be able to get our
record to. .500 this weekend,”
commented Remillard. ‘‘The
last two weeks have been
stressful. This week should not
be as tough.”’

With the National Champion-
ships now six weeks down the
road, the Generals have several
swimmers already qualified for
the event. Rand McClain, Tim
Rock and Bernot have all
qualified in individual events.
W&L’s 400-yard freestyle relay
team has also qualified for na-
tional competition.

Remillard sees Bernot as the
favorite to win the 50 and 100-
yard freestyles, although Ber-
not will have to defeat the
defending national champion.
‘‘He is capable of being a triple
winner in the NCAA’s,”’ said
Remillard. ‘‘No individual in
Division III has ever done that
before.”’

Freshmen Wes Payne in the
134-pound class and Greg Ken-
drick in the 167-pound division
picked up the wins over
Western Maryland. Payne,
Freshman Ron Thornton at 126,
captain Tim Valliere and

People were all over Evans
Dining Hall as the band sang in-
to the wee hours of Sunday mor-
ning. At one end were the 120 or
so dancers who had been there
virtually the whole time since 8
p.m. on Friday.

In front of them, at the base of
the stage where the Drifters
crooned ‘‘Sing a Happy Song,”’
Jay Blumberg and Rhonda Dee
Adkins danced, too.

Their appearance may well
have gone unnoticed by most in
the crowd which was jammed
into the dark cafeteria-turned-
dance hall.

The pair was having a big
time, like the rest of the crowd

doing. For every hour danced,
every beer drunk, every admis-
sion paid, and for every pie to
hit a professor’s face was a lit-
tle more money to enter the
fight against Muscular
Dystrophy, the disease that
forces people like Rhonda Dee
Adkins to live their lives in
wheelchairs.

When the siren sounded for
the final time around 2 a.m.
Sunday, Tripp Brower, chair-
man of the Danceathon, was on
stage thanking everyone for
their help and to tell them — for
the 13th time — how much the
total had increased over the last
hour’s total.

The goal was $22,000. They

out doing what it«does most
weekends at Washington and
Lee — drink, dance, listen to
music, talk...Certainly
Blumberg’s  ear-to-ear grin
gave it away that he was enjoy-
ing himself.

But there was something a lit-
tle different about the two new
dancers — in the midst of all the
people who had danced for
nearly 30 hours was a girl ina
wheelchair.

Actually, their dancing could
hardly have been more ap-
propriate.

‘Dance for those who can’t,”
read one of the banners lining
the walls of the room. And
that’s what everyone there was

   

nm

raised nearly $24,000.

The money must still be col-
lected and expenses deducted,
but the bottom line is, as
Brower had said earlier, that a
little bit more will be going to
help those afflicted by M.D.

Blumberg, who organized the
first Superdances at W&L four
years ago, told the crowd Satur-
day afternoon that one day
Muscular Dystrophy will be
licked and there’ll be no need to
hold ‘‘superdances’’ to combat
it.

Until then, people will have to
continue dancing for and with
those like Rhonda Dee Adkins
as Blumberg did Saturday
night.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

 

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The Resignation

Perhaps the greatest indication of the success of
Robert E.R. Huntley as president of Washington and
Lee was the shock and dismay which accompanied
the announcement of his resignation Monday. In an
age when universities are hard-pressed to meet both
financial and academic standards, President Huntley
provided W&L with both an outstanding fund-raising
program and revisions for the school’s curriculum.

As one professor indicated last Tuesday, the
average college president enters office and, within
‘he next five to six years, has generally screwed up
enough things to merit his resignation. The opposite
holds true for President Huntley. In his 14 years at the
helm, Washington and Lee has added a modern law
school, a modern library and a modern athletic facili-
ty. In addition, the school has renovated several
buildings along the Colonnade. And even though
President Huntley will leave office at the end of the
year, more improvements are on the way.

The university's board of trustees faces an in-
teresting choice. As President Huntley pointed out in
an interview with the Phi last Monday, the board can
choose either an administrator or a fund-raiser. With
the last decade having seen an emphasis on fund-
raising, perhaps the university will choose to spend
the next decade on improving the curriculum.

President Huntley was unique in that he was able to
handle both the academic and financial crises of this
school with precision. While he strove at all times to
meet the school’s financial needs, he never lost sight
of the value of the liberal arts education. In this
respect, the university will be fortunate to find a man
of equal talents.

Superdance '82

Superdance '82, Washington and Lee’s contribution
to the fight against muscular dystrophy, was a suc-
cess in more than one way. Financially, the super-
dance collected $2,000 more than it had projected. But
more importantly, Superdance '82 was an event en-
joyed by a majority of the campus.

Superdance ‘82 Chairman Tripp Brower and his
committee are to be commended for their efforts last
weekend. The people in the Superdance organization
pooled their resources to provide both the dancers
and spectators with outstanding entertainment for 30
continuous hours. Mr. Brower lived up to his boast
that Supernce '82 would be ‘W&L’s longest party.’

Credit for this success should certainly begin with
Mr. Brower and his committee, but should also be ex-
tended to all those people who danced and all those
people who supported the dancers. The Superdance
served as an example of how a community can join to
make an event a success. Besdies, how many times in
life does one get the chance to have a good time while
promoting a good cause”

1 Message to the Students of

Washington and Lee:

I want you to know of my deci-
sion to resign as President. For a
long time I have thought that a
college president should not re-
main in office indefinitely, and I
believe this is a good time in the
University’s life for a change to
occur. Some of my thinking is
contained in a letter I have just
sent to all Faculty and Alumni. |
am sending a copy of that letter
with this one to the Ring-tum
Phi.

The Board of Trustees is
establishing procedures to search
for my successor, and your views
and suggestions will be sought.

My most important source of
satisfaction during my years as a
teacher and administrator has
been observing the achievements
and successes of our students
while they are here and after they
leave us. My love for Washington
and Lee was born while 1 was here
as a student, and so it is also satis-
fying for me to observe how many
of our present students and young

alumni develop the same kind of
lasting affection for the Universi-
ty which has characterized
thousands of others over the
years.

Twill continue to serve as Presi-

Letters From The President

Dear Friends,

Please accept my apology for
the form of this letter — but there
is no convenient way for me to
communicate personally with all
of you.

Recently you should — have
received the January issue of the
Alumni Magazine announcing
the success of the Development
Program, a success attributable to
your generosity and hard work.
More than 86 percent of the funds
committed came from individual
alumni, faculty, and friends, The
astounding success of the pro-
gram is a mark of the vitality of
this old school and an unmis-
takable sign of the loyalty of those
who love it. We cannot regard our
University as secure, but we can
regard it as strong enough to ap-
proach the future boldly and
unafraid.

My purpose in writing to you
now is to tell you of my decision to
resign as president, effective at
the end of 1982. Perhaps this word
will not come as a great surprise to
most of you, especially to those
who have known me for some
time. When I became president,
fourteen years ago this week, it
seemed to me that a college presi-

Washington and Lee University

dent ought to set general objec-
tives he would like to see achieved
over a decade or so, and thereafter
should step aside. 1 believe that
usually it is better for a new per-
son to lead the institution into the
next cyele of its life.

This should be a good time in
our history for the school to seek
and obtain a new president. We
have just completed a decade-long
development: effort: successfully.
Our faculty is talented and
dedicated, our Board of Trustees
is uniquely strong, our alumni
and friends generous and
devoted, and we are increasingly
attracting able students in ade-
quate numbers. From such a posi-
tion of strength a change in the
presidency is best made. You will
be informed in the next Alumni
Magazine about the procedures
which the Board has established
to seek my successor, Certainly,
your views will be requested.
Meanwhile, you may wish to send
your suggestions to the Presiden-
tial Search Committee here.

From my personal viewpoint,
my love for Washington and Lee
is as great as ever, and Lam sure it
always will be. But, quite simply,

enough,

I do not leave this office
—which represents the highest
honor that could come to’ me
—because 1 have some. special
aspiration to take another’ posi-
tion. | have no such aspiration,
and indeed do not expect to con-
sider other administrative posi-
tions in education,
elsewhere. Perhaps Twill teach
again — but Evelyn and L will con-
cern ourselves about that later.

We both hope to see many of
you personally in’ the months
ahead, and during the .
thereafter. As you would guess,
our strongest ties are with the
friends we have made through our
long association with Washington
and Lee.

Your support of the school is
extraordinary and essential, and I
know it will continue. Your sup-
port of Evelyn and me has been
for us a mainstay, and for that we
are lastingly grateful.

Sincerely,

Jan. 9 In The Pit
Root Boy Slim Joins The 80’s

From the Baltimore News-

American of July 18, 1980

We are living in strange
times: Wayne Newton, whose
voice used to sound like Mr.
Bill’s, has become a sex symbol
and the biggest draw in Vegas.
An old B-movie actor has
become president. Richard Nix-
on has become a_ multi-
millionaire by being a disgrace.
John Lennon went into the steer
business. Iran made America
look like a fat sissy and Jimmy
Carter’ his lips pouting,
wouldn’t light his Christmas
tree.

But the real shocker was
when I turned around on my
barstool at No Fish Today a few
nights ago and saw Root Boy
Slim looking downright respect-
able.

“The ’60s are over,” he said.

Gone was the tub of fat
around the belly, the scraggly
beard, the long, stringy hair
that hung like licorice down his
back. He’s lost weight and looks
slim, has replaced the beard
with an Errol Flynn moustache
and cut his hair. His shirt was
clean. He has taken to playing
chess.

“I’m quite good,’’ he says.

What’s the world coming to?
Has Root Boy Slim, the leader
of the old Sex Change Band,
mellowed? Has he turned
Republican or found Jesus or
what?

‘Don’t you believe it,” he
growled, slipping back into the
Root Boy Slim persona. “I’m
still as vile and tasteless as
ever. You'll see Saturday
night.”

Root Boy Slim will bring his
svelte, clean-cut body, his new
band, and his old debauchery
into the Marble Bar Saturday
night at 9:30.

“TI am looking for Jesus,’’. he
said. ‘“‘He owes me money.”

Slim did not join Wayne
Newton in singing ‘‘God Bless
America” at the Republican
Convention. ‘Republican? I’m
not even a Democrat,” he says.
“I’m a registered meterologist.
I think it’s Reagan behind (the
heat wave). It’s moved here
from Detroit.”’

 

Will representa-
tives for the
Cadaver Society
and the Sons of
Liberty Hall
please contact the
Calyx in Carole
Chappell’s office
before Friday,
Feb. 12th.

 

 

 

No, the stage version of Root
Boy Slim is as outrageous as
ever, but the man behind it has
toned down considerably, says
his manager, Joe Lee. ‘‘No
more staying up for nine days,”’
Lee said. Slim turned 36 this
week, and looks as if he’s going
tostick around for a while.

Root Boy Slim, born Foster
Mackenzie III, is the son of a
golf-course architect, a Yale
graduate, and a man who was
paid $40,000 by Warner Bros. to
leave the company after mak-
ing one legendary album. He
writes and performs such songs
as ‘‘Boogie ‘til You Puke,” (You
Broke My) Mood Ring,”’ ‘“‘The
Shah Is Gone,” and “Bride of
the Burro.”’

He acts like a one-man cast of
“One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s
Nest” on stage, rolling around
the floor, screaming for Brooke
Shields. He’s very believable

and very funny. And very’

smart. He knows that people
will pay to see a freak show. I
asked him if he would ever do
straight blues. ‘‘It just wouldn’t
sell,”’ he said.

This is not to say that Root
Boy Slim is a complete act. He
is a little different. I will never
forget the time I interviewed
him at his sleazy apartment in
Silver Spring. On that day his
body was a chemistry set of
controlled, dangerous substanc-
es. He talked me into discussing
the interview over a Szechuan
dinner, which, of course, I paid
for. Slim is perpetually broke.

He ordered lobster Szechuan,
the most expensive thing on the
menu, and several Zombies, the
most expensive drink on the
menu, and started raving about
how he was going to put a con-
tract out on Charlie McCollum
of the Washington Star for print-

ing something derogatory to his
musical ability. I drove him to
his place, where he got out of
the car, leaned over a dumpster
and promptly disgorged the
lobster Szechuan.

He then made a cocaine run,
snorting the white powder up
like a pig rooting for truffles,
and collapsed on the couch.

“‘Lawd, have MER-CY!”’ he
howled.

A few hours later, he stag-
gered onto the stage somewhere
in Frederick and actually per-
formed. I played the interview
back on the tape recorder and
heard a weird, mumbling rap
about basketball, interspersed
with sudden gospel-music
shrieks that would take the
hairs off James Brown’s chest.

The next few times our paths
crossed, he and his ‘band rang
up a $200 bar bill at the Childe
Harold in Washington and more
than $100 at the Marble Bar. He
ended the latter night by danc-
ing in a pair of soiled red boxer
shorts on top of the bar. Then
Slim went to England, did a tour
did not get paid royalties for an
album called Zoom on an ap-
‘propriately named label called
Illegal, and fired his band.

‘Actually, I fired myself,’’ he
said. He wanted to cut down on
the band’s expenses, he said,
and wanted a change. His new
band is now Cryin’ Out Loud,
featuring Ronnie Holloway, a
saxophonist from his old band.

He has been rehearsing with
the band — something he rarely
did before — and it is supposed
to be tighter and funkier than
the Sex Change Band, although
the Marble Bar date is only
their second show together. You
can find out who the real Root
Boy Slim is Saturday night. But
mammas, you'd better lock up
your daughters that night just
in case,

the failing King’s oneness with
himself and the blighted land.
(The Grail is the goblet from
which it is believed that Christ
drank at the Last Supper and in

which, it is said, Christ’s blood
was caught at the Crucifixion. )
The focus of the film is
Lancelot’s conviction that his il-
licit love for Guinevere, Ar-
thur’s queen, is the reason he

has failed in his search for the
Grail. He concludes that they

“must renounce each other, but

Guinevere refuses to deny the
importance of their passion.
She suggests a different reason
for Lancelot’s failure to find the
Grail, and in doing so, implies
that presumptuousness is
behind the quintessential quest
of the Middle Ages: ‘“‘It was not
the Grail, it was God you sought
— and God is not a trophy you
can bring home.”’

MEMOREX

ii Quality Audio Recording Tape
Hi Bias Special —

The movie also offers a criti-
que of Arthur’s. knightly
chivalric ideal. The word
“chivalry” is derived from
“cheval,” which in French
means ‘“‘horse.’’ Riderless
horses signal the end of Ar-

thur’s vision. The soldiers of
Morded, Arthur’s bastard son,
unmounted and in light, flexible
armor, pile Arthur’s knights in-
to a heap of scrap metal, the
victims ultimately of their own

imprisoning and dehumanizing
armor.

We take great pleasure in an-
nouncing that the next movie to
be shown by the Film Society is
Man of Marble (1979), by the
Polish director Andrzej Wajda
(pronounced ‘‘Vayda’’), a

feature film which anticipates

recent political events in
Poland, including the military
takeover in December. The
movie is scheduled for Friday

Executive Committee Freezes SBA Funds

by Ben Jarratt

The Student Bar Association
had its funds frozen by the Ex-
ecutive Committee Monday
night, when an ‘SBA subcom-
mittee failed to appear before
the E.C. to give its monthly
report.

During the fall, the E.C.
adopted a proposal to freeze
funds if a subcommittee did not
appear before the E.C.

Morgan Griffith, Third-year
Law Rep., said the SBA would
not be able to present its report,
as the officers are currently
undertaking an extensive bar
preparation course. He mo-
tioned that the E.C. suspend the
requirement for this month’s
report and let the SBA present a
double report in March.

Ken Lang, ’82 Rep., stated the
officers should have made con-
tact with the E.C. There is a re-
quirement that a subcommittee
should contact the E.C., if it
would not be able to send a
representative.

“I’m perfectly sympathetic
with the SBA,” stated Ben Hale,
’84 Rep., ‘‘but we agreed earlier
in the year a subcommittee
should call us. We are bound by
that vote.”’

Tom Booher, First-year Law

Rep., expressed concern that
freezing funds would hinder the
SBA. He said the SBA was plan-
ning a Valentine’s Party this
weekend and would not be able
to pay expenses.

“‘T think it’s going to ruffle
feathers across the creek,’
stated E.C. Vice-president Jim
Averett. According to Averett,
Griffith’s motion that the SBA
be given an extension to March

was defeated 4-8. Griffith,
Booher, Averett and John
Viahoplus, ’84 Rep., voted in
favor of the motion.

Hale then moved that the SBA
funds be frozen until E.C. Presi-
dent Eric Myers talks to the of-
ficers. Myers can unfreeze the
funds, if he receives a satisfac-
tory reply. The motion passed
9-3. Griffith, Booher and
Viahoplus opposed. Myers said
he would try to clear this matter
up immediately.

Contact

Contact Co-chairmen R.D.
McLean and Mike Drinkwater
said the honorarium for F. Lee
Bailey cost $4,750. The other
speakers had averaged $2,500
this year. ‘‘With someone with a
name that Bailey has,” stated
Drinkwater, “‘you’re going to
have to pay that kind of figure.”’

Lang suggested the co-
chairmen talk to Henry Feuers-
tein of Focus about getting con-
gressmen to speak during
Spring term. Feurerstein
reported to the E.C. last week
that he could bring several con-
gressmen to W&L at minimal
costs.

Student Health

Thad Ellis reported the Stu-
dent Health Committee was
concerned that not enough
students were aware of the in-
surance policies at W&L. The
Student Handbook publishes
this information.

The committee also looked in-
to emergency procedures at the
athletic facilities. The athletic

‘department cannot afford a full-
time doctor to be present during
games. According to Ellis, if an
accident occurred, the biggest
problem is the legal aspect.
School Trainer Tom Jones
would be capable of handling

emergencies, but he is not a.

 

_ E.C. member Ben Hale.

doctor.

Ellis said there may be a
problem with the training room
during the Washington holiday
when two trainers will be out of
town. The athletic department
said it would handle this prob-

lem.
The school infirmary will

have restricted hours, but these
hours will be posted. Ellis said
W&L students have 24-hour ac-
cess to the emergency room at

Stonewall Jackson Hospital.
Courses and Degrees

Mike Skardon reported that
he and Brian Gibson are
relatively ineffective on the
Committee of Courses and
Degrees. They are not informed
on what is being brought up for
consideration.

“There are a few incidents -

where they try to slip stuff
through the back door,” stated

Skardon. The co.mmittee once

considered dropping the Dean’s
List. “A lot of faculty members
think the Dean’s List is a
farce.”

Colt Puryear reported the
Freshmen Admissions Commit-
tee discussed the policy of ac--
cepting sons of alumni to W&L
as a rule. There was a question
of whether one student had ac-
ceptable grades and SAT scores
in high school.

international Club

Henry Baey reported the In-
ternational Club will sponsor an
International Day in the spring.
Tentative plans include an In-
ternational Childrens’ Art Ex-
hibit, a Chinese opera and a
special meal in Evans Dining

Hall. Outing Club
Mike Gregory said the Outing
Club had one ski trip to
Wintergreen cancelled because
of weather. It seems the club
was involved in a three-car ac-
cident on the way to the slopes.
Fencing Club
_ The Fencing Club will be par-
ticipating in the Va. State Tour-
nament this Saturday, accord-
ing to club captain David
Hepler. The meet will be held at
William and Mary.

Myers announced the Big -
Three Elections will be held on’
Monday, Mar. 8. Petitions for
President, Vice-president and
Secretary are due in the E.C. of-
fice on Mar. 1.

 

 

12 Law Students Work In VITA Program

Twelve Washington and Lee
University law students will get
an opportunity to help low-
income residents of Rockbridge
County while learning more
about federal tax laws during
the next several weeks.

The students will participate
in VITA (Volunteer Income Tax
Assistance), a free tax prepara-
tion program sponsored by the
Taxpayer Assistance Division
of the Internal Revenue Ser-
vice. IRS provides materials,
training, and advice to
volunteer tax form preparers
through VITA.

“This service is really needed
by low-income people. If a pro-
gram like this weren’t avail-
able, they would end up going to
a commercial tax preparer and
getting charged,’ said Alan
Munro, the second-year law stu-
dent who initiated the VITA pro-
gram here.

The service will be offered
Tuesday from 6 to 9 p.m. and
Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m. from 13 until April 13. It
will be located at the Legal Aid
Society office at 203 N. Main St.
in Lexington.

The volunteers, who include
several Lexington residents as
well as the law students, have
been trained by IRS personnel
to complete 1040 and 1040A
federal income tax forms.

Participants in VITA are en-
couraged to bring their new tax
form, last year’s completed
return, all W-2 forms issued to
them, and other relevant finan-
cial data.

Though the volunteer tax
preparers will check all of the
returns they help complete for
mistakes in mathematics and

substance, persons who use
VITA are responsible for the

contents of their returns.
Elderly, low-income, and
handicapped people are

especially encouraged to take
advantage of this free service.

The other W&L law students
who are involved in VITA, in ad-
dition to Munro, are Jamie
Canup, Donna Gray, Fred
Earley, Cindy Harrington, Ted
Loper, C. Jay Robbins, Doug
Payne, Lynn Hoshall, John
Kent, Mike Farr, and Linda
Klein.

Selective Enforcement Of Noise Violations Alleged

by Scott Mason

In recent years, Washington
and Lee fraternities have
become greatly restricted with
the formation and enforcement
of strict University rules and
procedures. Of late, however,
the butt of these restrictions has
come not from the University
but from the Lexington Police
Department in the form of noise
violations.

Nevertheless, evidence sug-
gests that the Lexington Police
Department has been deviating
from written laws specifically
Stated in the Lexington, Virginia,

Charter and Code of Laws
regarding noise and the
amplification of sound.

According to the Lexington
code (section 15-33), it is
“unlawful for any person to
make use of sound-amplifying
equipment or loudspeakers, in
such a manner and that the
sound or noise thereof is audible
to the public, without a written
permit from the city manager.”
Lexington Chief of Police,
James A. Kirby, states that
anyone amplifying music must
have a permit and that this pro-
cedure ‘‘applies to everyone in
the city.”

The ‘permit to amplify
music’ enables music to be
played for a period of no longer
than three hours Monday
through Thursday or beyond 11
p.m. Friday and Saturday the
permit allows music to be
played for a period of no more
than four hours or beyond mid-
night.

According to an employee of
the Old Main Street Shopping
Mall, a group named the Down
Home Band had been practicing
for approximately one year in a
vacant room located above the
Mall. Practice sessions usually
took place every Tuesday and
Thursday evening between 5:30
and 6 p.m. The band had never
filed for a permit.

Approximately four weeks
ago, Lexington police received
a complaint in regard to ex-
cessive noise at the Old Main
Street Shopping Mall. Edwin J.
Curran, a sophomore residing
at the Phi Delta Theta fraterni-
ty house, a block from the Mall,
said he witnessed police officers
arrive at the scene, only to call
up to a window of the Mall, ask-
ing the band members to tone
down the music.

Curran said the noise was ex-
cessively loud and had been on
previous occasions as well. Kir-
by initially denied knowing
anything about the incident.
Later, however, he recalled
that a complaint had come in
regarding a disturbance at the
Old Main Street Mall, but he
had no further knowledge of the
details involved.

Kirby acknowledged that
under the Lexington code, the
band was required to file for a;
permit to amplify music. Dur-

‘Kappa Alpha,

ing that year-long period,
however, no permit was ever

2d and no violation was ever
issued,

Employees of the White Col-
umn Inn said that bards hired
for Friday and Saturday nights
usually perform from approx-
imately 9 p.m. to 1:30 a.m., or
until closing. The White Column
Inn only once has filed for a per-
mit toamplify music.

Ironically, Lexington police
have issued only one noise
violation to The White Column
Inn and that violation was given
the very date that the Inn’s lone
permit was filed. Contrary to
statements made by White Col-
umn Inn employees, Chief Kir-
by remarked that The White
Column Inn “has gotten per-
mits in the past.”

Under the Lexington code of
laws, The White Column Inn is
required to file for permits to
amplify music whenever bands
play there.

Records indicate that during
the months of September 1981
through January 1982, 175 noise
permits were granted by the
Lexington Police Dapartment,
174 of which were issued to
Washington and Lee fraternity
houses.

Eight fraternities, including
Kappa Alpha, Sigma Chi, Pi
Phi Kappa
Sigma, Phi Gamma Delta,
Sigma Phi Epsilon, and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon were in violation
of the Lexington sound-ampli-
fying code since that time and
were placed on two weeks social
probation by the University.

Chief Kirby stated that at the
start of the academic year,
fraternities are first given one
warning before any violations
are issued. Officer W.F. Knick
Jr. confirmed the one-warning
procedure.

Nonetheless, presidents of the

 

eight fraternities in violation of
the noise code since September
each specifically stated that
they had never received any
warning prior to the violations
bestowed by Lexington police.

Though Lexington police did
administer a warning to the
band members of the Old Main
Street Shopping Mall, no warn-
ing, according to the eight
fraternity presidents, was ever
given in any of the incidents
since September involving a
violation of the noise code.

Almost one year ago,
members of the Washington
and Lee Law School rented the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity house
during the undergraduate
Washington Holiday in mid-
February. The students never
applied for a permit to amplify
music nor were they ever issued
a violation of the Lexington

sound-amplifying code. Chief
Kirby remarked that the law
students would, indeed, need a
permit but had no knowledge of
the incident.

When questioned whether
church bells or the sounding of
the Virginia Military Institute
cannon would fall under section
15-31 of the Lexington code of
laws as “noise generally,”’
Chief Kirby said that the V.M.I.
cannon would qualify, but that
because V.M.I. is a military,
state-owned school, ‘‘they have
certain things they can do.”’

Kirby added that church bells
would not fall under the code
but gave no further explana-
tion. .

Evidence has arisen that may
show that certain private
groups in Lexington have not
had to comply with the same
amplified noise restrictions that

police impose on fraternities.

Although fraternities are re-
quired to obtain noise permits
before parties, a local band has
regularly practiced ja=town,
and the White Column ‘Inn*fias
had bands without obtaining the
permits,

Also, the police have issued at
least a warning fo ‘that local
band, despite a policy of no
warnings for the fraternities.

Chief Kirby flatly stated that
the Lexington Police Depart-
ment is “not discriminating
against students” with regard
to permits and violations of the
Lexington noise code. Kirby
said that the ‘‘same guidelines”’
apply to fraternities as well as
to Lexington citizens. Yet, says
Kirby, ‘Fraternities are lucky
to get as many permits as they
do,”’ and he charges fraternities
of having ‘‘wild parties.”’

Fowler Promoted To Lt. Col.

David F. Fowler Jr., pro-
fessor of military science at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, has been promoted to the

_ rank of lieutenant colonel.

At a Feb. 1 ceremony, W&L
president Robert E.R. Huntley

pinned the silver oak leaves of
his new rank to Fowler’s
epaulets.

The ceremony was followed
by a luncheon hosted by Col.
George F. Peters Jr., the Army
ROTC Area IV Commander.

Fowler was commissioned an
officer in the Army after more
than two years of enlisted ser-
vice in Europe. He served two
tours of duty in Vietnam and an
additional tour of duty in
Europe.

The W&L indoor track team
now has one meet’s experience
under its belt and as it ventures
to Lynchburg College this
Saturday for the annual Lynch-
burg indoor relays. This meet,
which includes a number of
ODAC teams, will serve as a
final tune-up for the tracksters
before the upcoming ODAC in-
door championship on Feb. 27 in
Lexington (V.M.1.).

The Generals’ showing at last
weekend’s VMI relays did not
prove to be decisive in terms of
total scoring, but the team gain-
ed valuable input. Highlighting
the meet for the Generals was

Shot putter John McKee had
an indoor personal-best effort
with a heave of 42’-11’’. The toss
should rank him among the

season.

The rest of the General sauad
participated in its respective
events and Head Coach Norris
Aldridge was pleased with his
team’s performances and pro-
gress.

Weight and event Coach
Frank Miriello was quoted as
saying, ‘‘at a big meet like VMI,
one has to set a goal and stick
with it. Anything beyond that is

attitude,’ said Miriello. ‘At
W&L we realize the athlete’s
potential and go with reason-
able standards for them no mat-
ter what kind of competition
they’re in.”

The indoor season is coming
down to the wire and this week’s
meet at Lynchburg looms large.
If the Generals make a good
showing their chances for an in-
door title could be strong. This
will be the team’s first test
against comparable opponents,
a factor the Generals have been
anticipating all winter long.

The Washington and Lee

Saturday to 4-6 after competing
in the Davidson College Invita-

Hampden-Sydney (22-19) and
Lynchburg College (33-17). The
Generals’ lone setback of the
dav came in the first round, in
which Catawba College took a
24-16 decision.

Captain Tim Valliere (158)

(heavyweight), and freshman
Jeff Dixon sustained the solid
performances that they have
given during the season by win-
ning all three of their matches.

(plus a win by forfeit).
Freshman Joe O’Neill scored a
21-0 margin in his two victories.

Head Coach Gary Franke was
satisfied with the work in the
upper weight classes but be-
lieves that the lower classes
should have done better. Said
the coach, “I was a little disap-
pointed with the lower weights,
but at the same time the four
guys in the upper weights did
well.”

Tonight the Generals will be
away for the last time this
season as they take on the
University of Richmond. Judg-
ing from what happened the last

time the same two teams met,
the Generals will have to be
well-prepared for the match.

“They have a good 126
pounder and a good heavy-
weight and their 158 man beat
Tim back in December,”’
Franke noted.

The season will end with a
1:30 p.m. duel meet Saturday
against Lynchburg and
Hampden-Sydney and a 7:30
p.m. match Tuesday against

 

Longwood. Both matches will

be held in the Warner Center.

gionals which will be held on

Bridgewater earlier in the
season.

Two other relatively easy vic-
tories, a 75-60 defeat of Catholic
University and a 72-46 crushing
of Lynchburg College, upped
the Generals’ record to 16-5, and
they maintained their grasp on
first place in the ODAC with a
9-2 conference mark.

You name it, Bridgewater us-
ed it to try to stop the Generals
high-powered offensive attack.
They opened in a simple 2-3
zone, but senior guard George
Spears scored six points in the
early going to propel W&L to a
quick 14-3 lead. The Eagles then
switched to a man-to-man, but
that didn’t fare much better as
the Generals steadily increased
their lead and stopped Bridge-
water cold on offense.

Brian Hanson’s basket at the
halftime buzzer gave the
Generals a 41-19 lead going into
the locker room. Bridgewater
shot a miserable 26.9% from the
floor in the half to the Generals’
51.6%.

However, the Generals were ex-

to John Lee Graves, who led the
squad with 17 points and 11 re-

from the lane was followed by a
W&L run of six points a minute
later that ended any hope
Bridgewater had.

The game then turned sloppy,

Freshman George Seavy clock-

sophomore Gary Meyer posted
his best time for the season in
the 200-yard freestyle.

Other W&L swimmers con-

Jeff Gee maintained unbeaten

Fencing Club Triumphs

by John M. Cleghorn

“A real trouncing’’ are the
words W&L fencing club cap-
tain David Hepler used to
desoribe their victory over The
Citadel this past Saturday at
Warner Center. Virginia
Military Academy also de-
feated The Citadel in the same
competition.

The Citadel was W&L’s third
match of the season after.an

18-9 loss Navy and a 13-14 loss to
VMI, a match described by

Hepler as ‘“‘about as close as
you can get.”’

A fencing match is made up of
27 bouts, the winner of the ma-
jority being the match victor.
Competition is divided into
three weapon categories, the
sabre, the foil, and the epee. In
each category there are three
team members who compete
against the other team in a
round-robin event making 27
bouts.

Against The Citadel, W&L’s
sabre team members scored
the bulk of the wins. Clyde

Harkrader, Pat Berg, an
Chuck Depois won each of their
bouts to give W&L nine wins.

Each weapon carries its own
set of rules. The epee competi-
tion counts a touch for any con-
tact to the body as a score. The
sabre scoring zone is limited to
the upper body and the foil is
further limited to the torso only.
The winner of the bout is the
first to score five touches.

A touch in both the foil and
epee categories can be scored
with the point of the weapon on-
ly. The sabre touch can be
scored with a slashing motion.
These differences are traceable
to the weapons’ origins, the foil
and epee being used for actual
fencing while sabres resembled
those used by mounted cava-
liers, ; :

The Washington and Lee fenc-
ing club is advised by Dr.
James Worth. “Dr. Worth has
been very enthusiastic and has
helped the team a lot,” said

last regular season home meet
for senior co-captains Mike Ber-
not and Herb Gresens.

Gresens summed up his feel-
ings about the final meet when
he noted ‘I’ve been swimming
since I was seven or so, and I’ve
put a lot of effort into it. So ina
way it’ll be a relief and in a way
it’ll be kind of sad.”’

Although the VCU meet will
be the last home meet, the
Generals still will compete in
several roads meets starting
with a Sat., Feb. 13 encounter
with Georgetown and Glassboro
State.

‘‘We want to come out of that
meet with a split,” said Remil-
lard.

The Glassboro meet offers the
possibility of a battle of cham-
pions in the 50-yard freestyle
event. W&L boasts the swim-

mers with the first and fourth °

best times nationally in the
event while Glassboro State
swimmers occupy the second
and third positions.

‘‘We’re going to swim to win
the meet, not to win the 50
freestyle at the expense of the
meet,”’ indicated Remillard,
who downplayed the impor-
tance of any single event.

Over the Washington holiday
break, the Generals compete in
the U.N.C.-Wilmington Invita-
tional on Feb. 18, 19 and 20.

‘“‘Last year we were 7th in the
meet. This year we want to
break into the top three,”
Remillard said.

“The majority of our swim-
mers will try to qualify for Na-
tionals at this meet,”’ Remillard
added. Remillard expects both
relay teams to qualify for the

swimmers placing in the top 10

Peterson, McClain

Earn A-A Honors -

Washington and Lee water
polo standouts Erik Peterson
and Rand McClain, both
residents of Miami, Florida,
have been selected to the Diviv-
sion III All-America teams an-
nounced this month by the
American Water Polo Caoches’
Association.

Peterson, a junior, received
recognition on the seven-
member first team while Mc-
Clain, a sophomore, was named
to the seven member second
team. Their selection marks the

second consecutive year the
Association has honored two
W&L players. Last winter cur-
rent sophomore Don Smith
received first team laurels and
classmate Tim Rock second-
team mention.

“These All-America honors
are true signs of our program’s
progress and the player’s pro-
gress,” relates Head Coach
Page Remillard, whose 1981
team posted an impressive 31-5
record and claimed the
Southern League champion-

    

ship. ‘‘And, as all four of these
athletes will be on the 1982
team, we look for continued suc-

~ cess.”

Whereas Rock and Smith pro-
ved themselves primarily on
defense, Peterson and McClain
were offensive mainstays for
the Generals. Peterson col-
lected a season record 152 goals
while McClain led the team in
assists. ‘“‘Eric’s scoring figure
speaks for itself; however, he
would not have had nearly that
number without Rand passing

to him. Conversely, Rand’s
assist capabilities were indeed
due partly to Erik’s scoring
abilities,’’ explains Remillard.

Peterson, who earned his first
W&L polo letter this past season
after transferring to the Univer-
sity, served along with Rock as
the team co-captian. McClain, a
two-year letterman, is current-
ly a key freestyle sprinter on
the Generals’ swimming team,
where he has the chance to earn
another All-America award,”’
according to the coach.

The E.C. Midterm Report: What’s Missing?

In the six months since the academic year
began, the Executive Committee has watched

student body funds efficiently, preserved the
honor system diligently, dealt with the press

honestly and been more straightforward with
the student body than any E.C. in recent

memory.

 

 

Ken Lang, Senior Rep., during Monday’s Executive Committee meeting, debates
Contact’s expenditures on F. Lee Bailey. To his left are representatives Frank
Smith, Ted McQuiston, and Cole Dawson.

 

And yet, something is missing.
—

by Todd Smith

If one were to make a policy
of what the E.C. has done this
year it would be very much like
Ronald Reagan’s Voluntarism:
“The government that governs
best, governs least.”’

To do so, however, would be
to assign a policy where there is
none.

The Executive Committee
waits for people and provicits
to gravitate towards it, then
quickly and efficiently, honestly
and straightforwardly probes
and brightens the issues.

Then it waits for the next
issue.

E.C. representatives and
others can quickly point out: (1)
that they are too busy with the
honor system to increase their
workload, (2)° that they are
elected as mediators, facil-
itators and budgeters, nor
legislative super-heroes, (3)
that there are no real problems
for them to address, and (4)
that the criticism is unjust and
they do initiate solutions to pro-
blems without being prodded.

Morgan Griffith, Third-year
Law Rep., certainly needs no
prodding, having brought in for
debate two of the largest issues
of the year: a possible tele-

phone cooperative that would
eliminate deposit payments for

students, and the possible addi-
tion of two members to the com-
mittee.

But with these two issues
spoken for, the remainder of the
year’s activities seems to be
reaction to subcommittee
reports.

The E.C. can proudly point to
three revisions students made
in the constitution in mid-
October. One of the revisions
allows for more fair representa-
tion for law students and would
not have passed without the
E.C.’s effort, particularly the
door-to-door campaign of Presi-
dent Eric Myers.

Whatever is missing is small.
It is hard to pinpoint blame.
Several representatives have
felt something lacking them-
selves and expressed off-the-
record dissatisfaction.

To take Myers to the wood-
shed for his leadership is

wrong. The E.C. is a group of

leaders, not a train of circus
elephants. Remember that the
off-the-record dissatisfaction
last year was that then-
President Bob Willis and Vice
President Willie Mackie
domineered the E.C. While

   

Putting the student body to use, in September the E.C. interviews
applicants for membership on faculty committees.

Myers has not been any great
inspiration, he has worked hard
and performed well the role
assigned him.

Assume that we cannot blame
mankind in general, or the stu-
dent body, which is so disin-
terested that large chunks of it
offer themselves each spring
for election as representatives.

The burden of responsibility,
then, for what has: been a
mediocre year for debate, in-
itiative and effective. grams
from the E.C. must rest on each
member’s shoulders. It is a
small burden, because they are
one of the most honest and
diligent E.C.’s in a long time.
They could be better, that’s all.

The members could pursue
the idea of an alternative social
program, which was brought up

at budget hearings in Septem-
ber, though no one will
remember. They could pursue
the idea of alcohol counseling,
which Myers investigated as a
junior representative. They
could make use of the people
who. turn out. for work on ad-
visory committees and are not
appointed, especially freshmen.
They could do a little more work
on the subcommittees they are
assigned to (subcommittees
monitor groups like the SAB,
Contact, etc.)

In an October interview
Myers said, “I think I’d like to
decentralize things a little
more.” With that he threw the
ball to the rest of the commit-
tee. Now. if more people would
just stop standing around look-
ing at it.

 

 

MORGAN GRIFFITH

-Law Representative

Morgan Griffith takes the Ex-
ecutive Committee home with
him to the lawschool after the
meeting, and is thereby the
most valuable member of the
year. He proposed a telephone
cooperative to lower costs and
brought up the problem of
under-representation of fresh-
men and law students. Griffith
reminds the E.C. of law student
opinions and _ needs, and
chastises in his apologetic way
the subcommittees like Contact
which overlook the law school
schedule.

Griffith’s knowledge of law

 

school problems makes Lewis
Hall the best represented lobby
in student government. But he
is fair with undergraduate con-
cerns, too. He speaks when he
has something to say, which is
often. Outside of the E.C. room,
he plugs the organizations he
knows need help. He has even
solicited writers for the Ring-
tum Phi, and has once come by
himself to help with layout.

Griffith obviously cares about
the job he is doing and the stu-
dent body will watch hopefully
to see if he runs for re-election.

BEN HALE

 

 

Sophomore Representative

Ben Hale is by far the wittiest
of the E.C. representatives. He
is smart, honest, diligent and
sensitive to students’ needs. But
he has gone downhill this year.

Hale was a_ tremendous
presence during the budget
hearings. He filled in the gaps
and asked the necessary ques-
tions and then put the budget re-
quest into motion form. He pro-
bably did this to make things
move quickly, not to affix his
name to the minutes. For the
next two months, Hale took ma-
jor roles in discussions. Hale
was primarily answerable for
the Intellectual Symposium,
which was later picked up and

developed by students. Hale’s
concerns about the Contact
Speakers program were clearly
and convincingly voiced.

Yet, Hale seemed to run out of
steam and now takes a smaller
role in debate. It was a case of
the irresistible force being sat

_ upon by the immovable object

— in this case, the lack of
substantial issues and enlight-
ened, enthusiastic causes. Or
perhaps his studies piled up.
Whatever the reason, Hale
moved down to the level of the
rest of the E.C. somewhere dur-
ing the year; he is smart,
honest, etc.

KEN LANG

Senior Representative

Ken Lang never lets a budget
slip through his fingers without
understanding and approving
it. His comments are sharp at
the meetings, which are usually
given over to the questioning of
subcommittees on their spen-
ding.

Lang represents a different
side of many arguments and
this is important. Lang seems
motivated by a genuine sense of
service, speaking not just to
hear himself speak. He fought a
measure that would have re-
scinded two students appointed
by the E.C. to the Publications
Board on the grounds that peo-
ple mattered more than an am-
biguous phrase in the constitu-

 

tion. He lost, but worked out a
compromise that put the two
back into the meetings.

Lang fought the motion by
Frank Smith to recommend
that the IFC examine the issue
of delayed Rush. He fought it
because he was genuinely
afraid of invading the IFC’s
turf, a legitimate fear, not
because of disinterest in the
plight of freshmen. —

Lang is not afraid to say what
he thinks, although he is afraid
of saying and doing too much.
He is a good representative,
though he might realize that
almost any concerned thought-
ful action by the E.C. is'likely to
be beneficial.

FRANK SMITH

 

 

\

Junior Representative

Frank Smith is serving his se-
cond term on the E.C. but has
not seemed to warm up to the
job. In fact, he probably dislikes
it. Smith has already announc-
ed that he will not run again.
His silence is sometimes con-
spicuous.

He has spoken on several im-
portant issues, however. Smith
brought up the subject of a
delayed fraternity Rush when
others on the Committee would
not. He is sometimes adamant
in defending the constitution (as
when he argued for rescinding

the two E.C, pub board
members). Smith has done a
good job following the SAB.
Unfortunately- these are the
exceptions and Smith rarely
enters debate. Perhaps, he can
be excused for judging the
debates useless, One recalls one
member’s speech to the Student
Control Ceutnittee last spring
about how the F.C, was like the
federal government and S.C.C.
was like fhie states. Smith
should realize that his com-
ments, and his actions, can only
improve thé Situation.

Myers has-been a good presi-

hard work to the job, along with
a knowledge of how things were
run in the past that could be
taken too easily for granted.

The president is not skilled,
however, in parliamentarian’s
tricks and the meetings could
be run more efficiently. Myers
allows each E.C. member to

Myers discourages members
from speaking because they do

He seems genuinely interested
in others’ points of view and is
very open to suggestions, even
if he sometimes is unable to
draw those views out of every-
one on the committee.

Myers labors to enact the con-
stitutional revisions bequeathed

paper, and he knows it. Myers
paired up with other E.C.

attempt (last year the E.C.
tried several times) robbed him
of an issue and a theme for the
year.

Past presidents of the E.C.
have been slick and talented
politicians, which Myers is not.
As a_ result, meetings are
sometimes poorly organized,
debates sometimes dull and
repetitive. and the questioning
of subcommittees sometimes
pointless and uninformative.

Myers is fair and selfless. He
is willing to do the work.

JIM AVERETT

Jim Averett as vice president
is in charge of the E.C.’s
finances, a job which is inten-
sive only during the budget
hearings. Averett will probably
contend with Bennett Ross for
the president’s spot in the up-
coming elections.

Averett has introduced no im-
portant legislation, but that
puts him in the majority. More,
however, is expected of the vice
president than of the average
member. Averett has a low in-
tensity approach to almost
cynical debate and enters often.
His comments are generally in-
formed and reveal that he has
many contacts with deans, ad-
ministrators, and law students.

Averett seems to perform his
office adequately.

BENNETT ROSS

Bennett Ross has less respon-
sibility than Averett but seems
to match him in accomplish-
ments. His comments during
debate have always been
enlightening and reflective of a
keen sense of the students’
needs. When the Executive
Committee rejected the budget

request of Intervarsity ‘Ct hris-
tian Fellowship, Ross:noted that
the question was not so mueh of
whether to support religious
propogation, but whether to
support alternative social
groups and _ non-fraternity
lifestyles. :

Ross served on a committee
that led to an important clari-
fication of the E.C.’s relation to
the Publications Board. The let-
ter Ross wrote on behalf of the
E.C. to the Inter-Fraternity
Council, asking the IFC to ad-
dress the problem of a delayed
rush, has been praised by other
representatives and was taken
well by the IFC

Ross has done much more
than the average secretary, and
done it much better than the
average E.C. member.

TRIPP BROWER
Senior Representative

Brower has asserted himselt
on the committee this year and
has performed well. He is effec-
tive in debate. Whereas last
year he was accused by the
Phi’s midterm report for doing
little because of his involve-
ment in the Muscular Dystro-
phy Dance, he has managed
both tasks well this year.

Brower has provided good
contacts to the students work-
ing on the Intellectual Sym-
posium (Focus), and has writ-
ten a letter to the Phi to drum
up support for the idea. Hope-
fully, his interest will see the
project through this its first
year.

 

TOM BOOHER

Law Representative

Tom Booher won a highly con-
tested law school election to
come to the E.C. Much is ex-
pected of him, but Booher
seems stymied by the system,

is intelligent and has potential.

TED McQUISTON

Sophomore Representative

Ted McQuiston suffers in a
comparison with Hale, but the
former has done a good job, and
is unafraid to speak his mind.

 

 

 

John Vlahoplus began the
year vociferously but has turn-
ed into quite a good E.C.
member. He is effective in
debate and his clear reasoning
facilitates his work with the Stu-
dent Bar Association, to which
is an ad-hoc member.

Viahoplus has spent a good
deal of time researching the
judicial precedents for the
honor system and seems to
have more interest in the honor
system’s procedure than other
E.C. members. Whether this is
worthwhile or just so much
philosophical rabbit chasing,
one cannot tell. Vlahoplus’

November suggestion that a
subcommittee be formed to in-
vestigate improving the honor
system through upperclassman
orientations and other methods
shows that he can find practical ===
uses for his ideas.

 

The junior representative
seems to grasp the idea of reac- f
ting less to issues and acting
more on them. He spoke at
length to this effect during a
debate on whether to discuss a

Review:

‘Stunt Man’ Is Quite A Feat

by Todd Jones

The Stunt Man deals with a
man wanted by the police.
While being chased, he
stumbles onto a movie set and
becomes a member of that
troupe to evade the police. An
interesting script with in-
teresting characters makes this
movie a winner.

Steve Raisbeck is being chas-
ed by the police. He evades
them and is walking alone on a

bridge when he sees an old
Mercedes Benz coming right at
him. He throws a piece of iron
at the car and it goes crashing
into the river below him. He
notices a helicopter with people
who saw him, so he runs away.
Later on, Raisbeck is on the
beach when the man in the
helicopter talks to him. The
man in the helicopter is actually
Peter O’Toole and he is direc-
ting a movie on location at the

beach. The man in the ill-fated
car died, so O’Toole wants
Raisbeck to assume the dead
man’s identity so that O’Toole
won’t get in trouble with the
police.

Raisbeck has never done any
stunts, but is now the leading
man’s double in the picture.
Needless to say, he must at-
tempt some incredibly dan-
gerous stunts. O’Toole becomes
fascinated with the determina-
tion this man has, but feels that
he is being driven to the point
where he no longer cares for his

own safety
O’Toole is obsessed with what

crime Raisbeck has committed:
and allows him to continue on.
his job rather than be turned:
over to the police. Unfortunate’
ly, the stunts become more
dangerous until finally O’Toole
wants Raisbeck to drive a car
off the same bridge that the
original stunt man was killed
on.

Raisbeck gives a fine perfor-
mance. His character is
somewhat thin, but he develops
it well when he explains that the
police want him for attempted
murder. It ends up that the
murder was unintentional. You
see his character develop from
a man on the run to a profes-
sional.

O’Toole is tremendous. He
was nominated for Best Actor
at the Oscar ceremonies for his
performance in this movie and
it is easy to see why. O’Toole’s
character is melodramatic,
sensitive. He plays a somewhat
homosexual director who is
obsessed with making a
wonderful movie on war with a
deep statement. In the film,
everyone jumps the moment ~

O’Toole speaks. It is easy to see
why,

the leading lady about the inci-

cries not at the supposed
destruction around her, but out

The music is likewise perfect.
It adds to the film’s concept of a
lack of reality. One especially
carnivalistic theme is constant-
ly repeated and is very effec-
tive.

The Stunt Man is an excellent
film. O’Toole’s performance is
not to be missed. He is dazzling
in a film that has an excellent

makes this film one of the best:

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

 

 

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Midterms

A good deal of our readership’s curiosity will be
satisfied this week after it reads the Phi’s review of
the Executive Committee. It seems that most of our
readers anticipate not excellent stories or insightful
analyses, but good old-fashioned roastings.

Well, for those who enjoy seeing the Executive
Committee squirm, we are likely to seem a failure.
Our assessment was not that the E.C. is full of losers,
but that it has done an adequate job. The only thing
we find wrong about this is the ambiguous meaning of
the term ‘‘adequate.’’

Mr. Webster defines adequate as ‘equal to the re-
quirement or occasion.”’ In the case of the E.C., this
seems true. The 1981-82 Executive Committee does a
satisfactory job on the matters brought before it. The
area in which the E.C. may be criticized is its lack of
initiative. To its credit, the E.C. has brought forth ac-
tion on several problems. Unfortunately, it seems to
discuss the problem and then sit back and wait for
another to occur. :

In retrospect, the E.C. may suffer from a quality
that plagues most governmental institutions —
mediocrity. Debate among committee members has
been mediocre at best. Initiative can be described as
mediocre. The group as a whole is intelligent but, un-
fortuantely, mediocre.

To dress down individual members seems to us to
be both pointless and unecessarily malicious. Certain-
ly some members have outperformed others. If the
committee’s performance to to improve, however, it
must be a group effort.

We are not labeling this year’s E.C. a failure. In ad-
dition, we do not want to commend it excessively. We
believe that it is an honest and diligent group of peo-

(Author’s Note: This was written for last week’s
Phi which, you may know, came out two days
after Groundhog Day. The Editors did not have
room for it, so they must be forgiven for killing the
timeliness which was intended. )

Does anybody not know that Tues., Feb. 2, was
Groundhog Day?

According to legend, you know, the rotund little
rodent is roused from. winter’s sleep on Feb. 2 of
each calendar year. He pops out of his hole and if
he sees his shadow it means six more weeks of
crummy weather, if he doesn’t, etc.

Now I always figured this was a localized set-up
— in other words the local groundhogs might not
see their shadows (as I presume they did not Tues-
day unless they only looked for a few minutes
around 10:30) meaning we’re home free even if,
say, a New Jersey woodchuck saw his shadow.
Well, no.

Apparently there is an official groundhog, with
an idiotic name I don’t remember, in some
obscure Pennsylvania town. It is the presence of
his shadow alone which determines
meteorological patterns for the nation.

This particiular animal’s emergence is a media
event. Instead of a hole in the ground, he lives ina
white box that resembles a portable dishwasher.
And he doesn’t crawl out quietly, let alone volun-
tarily, or with any dignity. A silly little man in a
top hat drags the terrified creature from the box
and holds him, prostrate, before a gawking crowd
of reporters. The man then announces that the lit-
tle beast saw his shadow and all that goes with
that. He didn’t point out tha the shadow was cast
with the help of glaring klieg lights.

So, even if a local groundhog saw no shadow, a
promise of awful weather pervades because some

 

Ground Hog Day, If You Care

Pennsylvania specimen called Woodrow C. Chuck
or something spent a few agonizing seconds dangl-
ing in front of T.V. cameras.

One wonders why, in the first place, a more no-
ble animal was not chosen to be forever associated
with the weather map. But, were it not for this
day, what possible distinction could be afforded
the groundhog? Unlike beavers they don’t have
neat tails, nor do they fell trees or do anything
even remotely useful. They don’t even bother to
wash their food properly like raccoons.
They are bulbous and unattractive, resembling
dirty, helium-inflated rats. And there is no grosser
roadside spectacle than a fat groundhog squashed
by a car, lying there to the delight only of buzzards
and the swarms of flies which accompany sum-
mer. Take Feb. 2 away from them and they’d be
immortalized only in the childhood ditty about
how much wood they can chuck if they could chuck
it.

Another question which pops to mind is who has
kept a track record of the beast’s accuracy?

My favorite Groundhog Day story was told bya
W&L professor to her class Tuesday. Seems her
five-year-old son, already steeped in groundhog
lore, came running to her saying ‘‘Oooh mommie,
come look at the groundhog in the front yard!”

How charming, the parent must have thought,
little Junior has spotted old Mr. Woodchuck out
there looking for his shadow. This is something
one reads about in Uncle Wiggly.

She then went to the window and watched with
the child as their dogs stood over the bloody corpse
of Mr. Woodchuck, whom they had savaged before
he could even see if he’d cast a shadow or not.

No moral to that tale - just senseless violence.
Enjoy the next six weeks.

Washington and Lee University
indicates that more than 30 per-
cent of the Class of 1985 plans a
career in law.

Asked to indicate their
“probable career occupation,”
30.9 percent of the W&L
freshmen participating in the
survey selected the category
“lawyer (attorney) or judge.”

In recent years, law has been
the leading career choice
among W&L freshmen by a sig-
nificant margin. A year ago; for
instance, 29.9 percent of the
members of W&L’s freshman
class planned a career in law.

By comparison, 4.5 percent of
all freshman men taking part in

the nationwide survey indicated
law as a probable career while
11.1 percent of the freshman
men at private universities
chose law as a probable career.

The annual survey is part of
the Cooperative Institutional
Research Program conducted
jointly by the American Council
on Education and UCLA. The
survey is based on a question-
naire completed by freshmen at
368 institutions (73 two-year col-
leges, 250 four-year colleges,
and 45 universities) throughout
the nation, including Washing-
ton and Lee.

The second most popular
career choice of the W&L
freshmen was “business ex-
ecutive,’’ which was the choice
of 19.4 percent as compared
with 11.2 percent of all
freshman men and 10.8 percent
of freshman men at private
universities.

Third among career choices
was ‘‘physician,” selected as a
probable career by 14 percent of
the W&L freshmen compared

Bellini’s ‘Norma’ Aired By LUR

Vincenzo Bellini’s ‘‘Norma,” a tragic drama of illicit passion set
in Roman-occupied Gaul, will be broadcast live from the
Metropolitan Opera House at 1 p.m. Saturday over campus radio
station WLUR-FM.

The cast for the broadcast will feature Renta Scotto in the title
role of Norma, the Druid High Pr estess who has broken her

religious vows for love; Tatiana Troyanos as Adalgisa, a virgin of
the Temple; Placido Domingo as the Roman Pro-consul Pollione;
and John Cheek as Norma’s father, Oroveso. James Levine con-
ducts.

During the single intermission ‘Opera News on the Air,” Edward
Downes, quizmaster for ‘‘Texaco’s Opera Quiz”’ will discuss the
music and story of ‘‘Norma”’ with Warren Jones, an assistant con-
ductor at the Metropolitan Opera, at the piano.

Based on a play by Alexandre Soumet, ‘Norma’ embodies the
early nineteenth century’s spirit of romanticism. Bellini’s musical
writing is at its most dramatic and expressive, always moving the
story towards its final, inevitable tragedy.

with 4.0 percent of all freshman
men and 14.5 percent of fresh-
man men at private univer-
sities. That was followed, in
order, by ‘‘engineer’’ (7.1 per-
cent) and “‘writer or journalist”’
(4.9 percent). Of the W&L
freshmen surveyed, 6.6 percent
indicated that they were
undecided about a career.

Asked in the survey to in-
dicate reasons ‘‘noted as very
important”’ in their decision to
attend college, 81.7 percent of
the W&L freshmen said they
hoped to ‘‘gain a general educa-
tion’’ while 78 percent said their
reason was to “prepare for
graduate school.”’

As for their choice of

' Washington and Lee, in par-

ticular, 89.8 percent indicated
that W&L’s ‘“‘good academic
reputation’’ was ‘‘very impor-
tant” in their decision to enroll
in the university. Nationally,
49.3 percent of freshman men
cited ‘“‘good academic reputa-
tion’’ as their reason for choos-
ing their college or university.

Asked to indicate ‘‘objectives
considered to be essential or
very important,” 78.7 percent of
the W&L freshmen chose “‘to be
an authority in my field” as an
essential objective.

In response to a series of
questions about current affairs,

Court Rules W&L SNU Debts

Liability Of SNU House Corp. |

by Bill Roberts

In a General District Court
hearing Wed., Jan. 27, Judge
Joseph E. Hess ruled that the
$488.62 still owed to Green
Valley Rent Alls by the now
defunct Sigma Nu fraternity is
the liability of the Sigma Nu
House Corp. ’

Green Valley Rent Alls was
suing the former president of
the fraternity, William
Dederick, for $488.62 in rental
fees. Dederick had signed a ren-
tal contract for some floor-
sanding equipment in Septem-
ber, 1981, and the fraternity has
not paid the bill.

Judge Hess ruled that
Dederick had signed the rental
contract as an officer of a cor-
poration and could not be held
liable for debts incurred by the
fraternity. Judge Hess ruled
that the Sigma Nu House Corp.
is legally responsible for the
chapter’s debts.

The Sigma Nu House Corp.
acts as a legal umbrella for the
chapter. The House Corp. holds
the insurance policy and mort-
gage on the fraternity building.

According to the executive
director of the Sigma Nu Na-
tional Fraternity, Maurice E.
Littlefield, approximately
$8,500 is still owed to local
businesses which had extended
credit tothe chapter.

The national organization,
which has its headquarters in
Lexington, holds the charter of
every Sigma Nu chapter in the
country.

Littlefield said that the na-
tional fraternity has been pay-
ing the chapter’s debts to
Washington and Lee. The
University made several loans
to the chapter in the past. These
loans are still current, and the
national fraternity has been
covering the payments for the
chapter. But the national frater-
nity cannot pay the chapter’s
debts to local businesses.

The coordinator of fraternity
affairs at Washington and Lee,
Dan Murphy, said, “The legal
entity responsible for those
debts is the house corporation.”

But the president of the
Sigma Nu House Corp., Jay
Denny, said, ‘“There seems to
be some difference of opinion
here.”

“‘T do not think the house cor-
poration is responsible for those
debts,” said Denny.

Denny said that he would be
meeting with Littlefield to
decide on a strategy for collect-
ing from the former chapter
members. According to Denny,
the house corporation and the
national fraternity are planning
to hold the former chapter
members responsible for the
debts to local businesses.

The problem is that the
chapter’s financial records
were stolen on Nov. 12, 1981.
The former chapter treasurer,
John Solitario, said that he had
kept the books in his apartment
at 114 E. Nelson St. Solitario
noticed that the accounts were
missing and contacted Dan
Murphy about the disap-
pearance the following day.

This occurred only 24 hours

before a fire caused damage to .

the basement and first floor of
the fraternity building. Accord-
ing to Littlefield, State Arson
Bureau investigators have
determined that the cause of the
fire was arson.

Littlefield said that since the
records of which former mem-
bers still owe the chapter were
stolen, they will now have to
Civide the $8,500 between the
students who were active
members at the time the debts
were incurred. Although the
records are missing, it is known
that several of the members
were not paying their dues.

“Once we have determined
exactly how much is owed, we
will determine who was on cam-

sibility.

pus last year and divide it into .
equal shares,” said Littlefield. +4
But he added, “It is unfor-
tunate, because now these peo- =|
ple who were paid up will have |
to bear an unequal share of the,
burden.”’

Solitario said, ‘‘I am not going
to do anything about it.’’ He
said that the general feeling
among the members is that
they are not responsible for the
debts.

‘Those who were paid up feel
they do not owe any more
money, and those who were not
are not ready to admit that they
owe anything,”’ said Solitario.

The Sigma Nu fraternity was
placed on probation last spring
because of financial irrespon-

The University prohibited
members from living or eating
in the fraternity building. Final-
ly, on Nov. 10, 1981, the Univer-
sity withdrew recognition of the
chapter.

clinch the victory. ‘‘We took
away their transition game,”’
said Canfield. ‘“‘The only way to
win in February—both home
and away—is to play good team
defense.”’

Eppes, who had dished out
nine assists the entire season,
contributed four against Lynch-
burg, and two guards, Spears
and Bond, pulled down four re-
bounds apiece. Graves led the

Generals’ attack with 15 points
and Billy Yates added 14.

All five W&L starters scored
within two points of each other,
Eppes leading the charge with
14, Yates adding 13 and Spears,
and Hanson 12, in the 75-60 win
over Catholic University Thurs-
day night in the Warner Center.
“The balanced scoring is an in-
dication of some offensive effec-
tiveness,”” commented Can-
field.

Law Colloquium Held On Aircraft Disasters

The question of which state’s
laws should be applied in cases
involving aircraft disasters was
addressed in a two-day collo-

domestic problem; 67.6 percent
felt high school grading is too
easy; and, 67.9 percent said
students should help evaluate

faculty.

Asked to indicate their
‘political orientation,”’ 51.8 per-
cent selected ‘‘conservative,”’
29.6 percent ‘‘middle-of-the-
road,’ and 14.4 percent

“‘liberal.”’ The W&L freshmen
thereby characterized them-
selves aS more conservative
than their counterparts at other
colleges and universities.

For instance, data from
freshman men at all other col-
leges showed that 55 percent
selected ‘‘middle-of-the-road’’

quium included Willis Reese,
professor of law at Columbia
University and author of the
most widely used volume on
conflict of law issues; Andreas
Lowenfeld, an authority on air-
craft law and professor at the
New York University law

 

and 18.1 percent chose
“Jiberal.”’ At private univer-
sities, 49.5 percent of the
freshman men were ‘‘middle-
of-the-road,”’ 28.8 percent were
“conservative,” and 23.5 per-
cent were ‘‘liberal.”’

As for their expectations of
college, 67.4 percent estimated
the chances are “‘very good”
that they will be satisfied with
college; 13 percent said they

-will likely change their career

choice; 66.3 percent said they
expect to find a job ina ‘‘prefer-
red field’; 57.6 percent said
they are likely to join a social
fraternity; and, 50.8 percent ex-
pect to make at least a B
average.

 

Fencing

(continued from page 5)

Fencing was a varsity sport
at W&L until 1942 when it was
dropped during the World War
II period. E.S. Humphreys,
Business Manager of the Lex-
ington News-Gazette and Head
Coach of the VMI fencing team,
revived the fencing program at
WA&L in 1976.

Commenting on the nature of
the sport, Hepler, a_ senior,
Says, “It takes many years to
become totally reflexive. It’s a
game of physical chess, think-
ing a couple of moves ahead of

your opponent and planning

your defensive strategy.”

This weekend the fencing club
will compete in the Virginia
Cup, which features action be-
tween six teams, all from the
state of Virginia.

“‘We’re hoping for about a -

fourth place finish,’’ said
Hepler. ‘“There will be several
schools that bring teams and
who will have a lot of discipline.
However, we will have several
individuals that finish high in
the state.”

SOAS Is Available

by Bruce Jones

An exciting and challenging
opportunity awaits one or two
W&L students interested in
African or Asian studies.

The School of Oriental and
African Studies in London,
probably the world’s very finest
school for African studies and
renowned for Asian studies, will
accept a few students, selected
by W&L, for junior year abroad
or postgraduate programs.

SOAS, part of the University
of London, is conveniently
located only two blocks from
the British Museum and a short
walk from Covent Garden, the
two main opera houses, and the
West End theaters.

Students at SOAS may take
introductory or highly special-
ized courses in fields of their
choice; African and Asian
politics, economics, geography,
history, sociology, law, music,
etc. are offered. Intensive train-
ing is available in dozens of
African and Asian languages,
among them Arabic, Bengali,

Korean, Sanskrit, Shona, Thai
and Zulu.

The SAS library boasts the
world’s most comprehensive
collection of printed materials
in Oriental and African studies ;
this resource is supplemented
by an expert faculty. The stu-
dent body itself, drawn from
more than 80 countries, is also a

wonderful source of _ inter-
cultural education for the
visiting student.

A program of study at SOAS

would be of great value to a |

W&L student interested either
in gaining an advantage over
the competition for foreign. af-
fairs, international business or

academic careers, or in
expanding his_ intellectual
horizons.

The cost, inclusive of room,
board, tuition and some vaca-
tion and spending money, is
$5,500 per term. Any one in-
terested should please contact
Dr. Minor Rogers or Dr. H. P.
Porter, Jr.

school; Lee Kreindler, a New
York attorney who has rep-
resented plaintiffs in aircraft
disaster cases; and, George
Tompkins, a New York attorney
who has represented airlines in
the cases.

Frederic L. Kirgis Jr.,
director of the Lewis Law
Center, coordinated the event,
which involved a series of infor-
mal roundtable discussions as
well as a two-hour session in
which the participants were
joined by members of the
Washington and Lee law school
faculty.

Reese presented a paper that
served as the basis for the
discussions. In his paper, Reese
proposed that plaintiffs be
allowed to select which state’s
laws they want to apply in cases
against airlines.

“As it now stands, the court
has the choice of which state’s
laws to apply, and the law is

~ very, very unclear on the sub-

ject,” explained Kirgis.

“Generally, everyone agreed
with Mr. Reese that the plaintiff
ought to have a choice. But
there was considerable dis-
agreement in the group over
which choices should be
available.”

Some of the options, ex-
plained Kirgis, would be the
laws of the home state of the
plaintiff, of the state where the
aircraft was manufactured, of
the principle place of business
of the airline, of the state from
which the airplane departed, or
of the state to which the
airplane was bound.

“Tt is an extremely com-

plicated situation,” Kirgis add-
ed. ‘In the case of the recent

Air Florida tragedy, for in-
stance, which state’s laws
should be applied in the cases?
The airplane departed from a
Virginia airport, but its crash
site is apparently in the District
of Columbia, The airline is
headquartered in Florida. But
you might also consider the
state in which the aircraft is
manufactured as well as the in- -
dividual states of the
passengers.”

Two of the participants in last
week’s colloquium are directly

_ involved in the litigation that

has already begun over the Air
Florida disaster — Tompkins -
represents the airline while
Kreindler represents some of
the plaintiffs.

A DIAMOND JUBILEE

by John Wells

Washington and Lee’s annual
Fancy Dress Weekend, still con-
sidered one of the country’s
premier college party week-
ends, rears its glittery head this
year on March 4, 5 and 6.

This year’s extravaganza is
marked by two distinctions: the
75th anniversary of the first af-
fair in 1907, and a move from
the Student Center to the
original site, Doremus Gym,
and the more spacious environs
of Warner Center.

This really isn’t the 75th Fan-
cy Dress — they nixed it during
World War II and for three
years in the decidedly radical
early 70s. But the Diamond
Jubilee is a good reason to get
excited, and it appears that the
SAB has spared no expense to
make the weekend a truly
memorable one.

An honest celebration of past
Fancy Dress Balls would re-
quire the expensive and uncom-
fortable custom of renting
elaborate costumes designed to
coincide with a gala theme.
Students can be grateful for the
comparative convenience of

black tie and the elegant gowns ;

of their dates. It is the ball itself f
that has come to define Fancy
Dress, and it is perhaps the last
remnant of Old East Coast col-
legia in existence, a touch of
class in a world of double knit
and designer jeans.

The Ball in recent years has
become chiefly notable for the
elaborate decorations executed
by busy SAB members. The
move to cavernous Warner
Center will understandably cut
down on some frills, but ex-
cellent lighting is expected to
help create a splendid, highly-
charged illusion.

The theme being Diamond
Jubilee, SAB officials have
strived to put together an even-
ing that will truly dazzle.

 

Mr. F.D. Arrives

 

Drawn to Warner Center by
the two glamorous searchlights
(which have prompted claims
of UFO sightings by local
residents), Mr. Fancy Dress
and his date will glide up the
steps to the modern Warner
facility. There they will glide
through the glassed-in hallway
on plush red carpet and be con-
fronted with so many alarming-
ly exciting choices of venue as
to induce frustrated euphoria.

So, before choosing, they may
gaze around the Entrance
Hallway, which will feature
‘The History of Fancy Dress.”
Through an array of posters,
anecdotes and reviews, the cou-
ple can pause to trace the
history of the Fancy Dress Ball
from the spartan effort of 1907
through three quarters of a cen-

 
 

thoroughly _ in-
formed, the F. D.’s may then

tury. Once

resume their dilemma of
deciding where to go.

The

 
 

 

 

Diamond Jubilee Ballroom

 

To their left, the ecstatic cou-
ple will find not Warner gym
but a fabulous Diamond Jubilee
Ballroom decorated with exotic
draperies, spectacular
backdrops and the afore-
mentioned Fab Lighting which,
according to the SAB press
release, will “transform the
basketball arena into a bona-
fide Celebration Hall.”

TICKETS

Tickets and memorabilia for
Fancy Dress ’82, ‘‘A Diamond
Jubilee,’’ will go on sale Mon.,
Mar. 1, one week after the W&L
undergraduate body has return-
ed from the Washington holi-
day.

Tickets for the Friday night
ball will cost $25. Tickets will
also be available at the door for
$30. Grain cups can be purchas-
ed at the rate of three for $1, and
Fancy Dress posters will be
available at the cost of $1
apiece.

some pretty awesome per-
formers — notably Benny Good-
man, Frank Sinatra, Count
Basie, Eddie Duchin, and his
son, Peter Duchin, who was
here just last year.

 

Champs d’ Elysee

 

 

 

Amid all this finery, classic
dance lovers will swoon to the
very high class strains of Lester
Lanin and his orchestra. Lanin
has made an excellent reputa-
tion on the debutante circuit
and it said to be a favorite of

First Partiers Ronnie and Nan-

cy. And he’s perfect for this
nostalgic occasion, having F.
D.’s upon a number of other
balls including the Golden
Jubilee back in the late 50s.
Lester has been preceded by

Hot rug-cutters may seek
refuge by sweeping up the
Ballroom steps into — not the
upstairs balcony, but — yes!
The famed Champs d’ Elysee du
Paris! The major tourist attrac-
tion and vital Parisian rue will
be reproduced to capture an
outdoors atmosphere with a
cafe, a real-life mime, a quick
sketch artist and a portraitist
from Andre Studio to capture
forever that special evening
that is Fancy Dress.

 

Themes of the Past

 

From.Gay Paris, Mr. and Mrs.

F. D. may venture into the next
special chamber — classrooms
done out in some of the finest F.
D. themes from the past (in
keeping with the retrospective
theme, you know). Step into
“Monte Carlo Night” (divine! )
and “The Roaring Twenties”
(boop-boop-a-doo! ). Tunes for
this fabulous arena will be pro-
vided by the Rock-n-Roll-
Rhythm-n-Blues sound of Eight
to the Bar. The SAB invites one
and all to “trip the life fan-
tastic, or try their luck at some
games of chance in its recrea-"
‘tion of a prohibition period
speak-easy.”’

 

Nostalgia Without Shame

 

After their fill of fun and
games the merry couple may -
once again stroll down les
Champs, glide through _ the
ballroom and check out the
other side of the Entrance
Hallway. There, in Doremus
Gym, where dear Miss Annie
held the first small-potatoes
masked ball in 1907 (an event to
be surpassed in_ historical
significance only by the fact
that Vice President Alben
Barkley succumbed there. in
1956) the couple can initially
soak up the nostalgia without
shame. Huge posters will bring
back memories of past Fancy
Dress Balls as will an ap-
propriately attired 1921 F. D.
couple along with earlier
themes, bands and decorations.

 

Beach and Soul

 

Nostalgia of another kind will

8 follow, although it is considered

standard contemporary W&L
frat entertainment — alter-
nating sets of Beach and Soul
(get off, Muffy!) by Chairmen
of the Board and the Voltage
Brothers. Dancers who do not
care to dip with Lester may
shag until they literally drop.

 

Midnight Surprise

 

Back amid the grandeur of
the main Ballroom, the evening
comes to a scintillating climax
when Lester unveils a surprise
guest at midnight and the ex-
hausted crowd can find new life
and extend its respective peaks
until the whole shootin’ match
shuts down (sometime in the

‘twee hours’’).

This single orgasmic night is
just one, albeit the biggest, of
several Fancy Dress events
that should leave all par-
ticipants numb with excitement
or burned out from too much
self-inflicted nirvana. But God
knows we all love it.

Other schools obviously don’t
know what they’re missing, it’s
almost here and after Wash-
ington Holiday...be ready.
 

 

Fancy Dress History |

Seventy-five-year-old Tradition

by Kip Gordon

Take an energetic librarian,
forty-seven dollars, a handful of
students in costume, and you
have all the main ingredients
for Washington and Lee’s first
Fancy Dress Ball in 1907.
Seventy-five years later the an-
nual event requires the talents
and efforts of 35 Student Ac-
tivities Board members, six
months of planning, a budget of
$55,000, and an expected turnout
of 4,000 people.

Miss Annie Jo White, a W&L
librarian, initiated the Fancy
Dress tradition when she threw
a costume party for a few of her
student friends, providing her
own initiative and the proceeds
from a theatrical production.
Aware of the possibilities for
social stimulus during the
doldrums of mid-winter, Miss
Annie set out to make her
February fete an annual affair.
Her efforts were at first greeted
with student indifference, but
her persistence paid off and her
masked ball soon gained the
support and enthusiasm of the
entire W&L community.

Each year Fancy Dress grew
in popularity and prestige. By
1919 its extravagance and
elaborate decorations were
famous throughout the South. In
1928 the affair received national
acclaim via The New York
Times, ‘Fancy Dress, the
South’s outstanding collegiate
social event.’’ By 1938 the Ball
had received coverage from
publications such as Life and
Look magazines.

Some highlights of that era,

clude: Van Hern brings his

dreds of girls — from New
Orleans, Atlanta, Louisville,

The annual event has been in-
terrupted twice in its seventy-
five year history. It was discon-
tinued during the war years of
the early 1940’s, and abandoned
for a three-year period begin-
ning in 1971. As the New York
Times reported that year,

“LEXINGTON, VA. —
They’re screaming bloody
murder here because
Washington and Lee University
has given up its Fancy Dress
Ball...

“‘Perhaps (one student sigh-
ed) it can be resurrected.”’

Resurrection took place in
1974 with the newly formed
SAB’s version of Mardi Gras,
and the revitalized tradition has
been growing in strength ever
since. In the past seventy-five
years Fancy Dress has taken
W&L to places such as the Ken-
tucky Derby, Buckingham
Palace, the Emerald City of Oz,
Hollywood, Paris, Egypt, New
York, and most recently,

Broadway. This year’s Ball will
revisit some of these themes in
a tribute to seventy-five years
of an ongoing tradition.

aaa Lanin——

This year, the SAB has
selected the Lester Lanin band
for the Fancy Dress Ball as the
headline act. This world
renowned band will appear in
Warner Center from 8:30 to
12:30 a.m. on Friday, March 5.

Lanin’s music has_ been
described as ‘‘the beat heard
round the world.”’ Indeed, in its
over 30 years, Lanin’s band has
appeared before every Presi-

. dent from Truman to Reagan at

inaugural balls and other
special occasions.

Lanin is a favorite of the
British Royal Family, and was
once given the Royal salute by
the Queen Mother. Other world
officials have sought Lanin for
their banquets and debutante
balls.

A factor enhancing Lanin’s
popularity is his practice of
varying his program to suit any
occasion. This means that the
Royal Family might hear sets
of continuous music suited to

 

 

their tastes, while the slightly
less dignified guests at the Fan-
cy Dress Ball might get, shall
we say, a program suited for
just about anything.

In 1956, realizing the rising in-
fluence of rock music, Lanin ad-
ded guitars to his Big Band
sound. A move which proved
unheard of by other musicians.

Lanin was born into a musical
family in Philadelphia. His
father, founder of the first In-
ternational Orchestra, gave
Lanin much of his philosophy of
music, urging him to develop a
style that was “distinctive and
recognizable.”’

His recordings include “Les
at the Tiffany Ball,’”’ which was
recorded in 1959 at the Vander-
bilt estate in Newport.

The Lester Lanin Band will
appear throughout the evening
in the ‘‘Waldorf Astoria
Ballroom’”’ at the Fancy Dress
Ball. The Band’s cosmopolitan
flair should create the perfect
mood for this year’s Diamond
Jubilee theme.

Eight to the Bar

Swing, swing, swing

It’s an unlikely scene: A
seven-piece swing band playing
’30s and ’40s music with such
skill and abandon that
members of the audience are
compelled to leave their seats
and jitterbug.

Unlikely, yes. Fictional, no.

The era of swing is being
revived by a band called Eight
to the Bar. The group has
become so popular that it can
fill a nightclub on the slowest
Sunday night.

Eight to the Bar is evidently
on to something — young people

‘will still gravitate to the swing
sound of yesteryear.

‘‘We’re having a great deal of
success right now,” said Bar-
bara Lyon, one of the leaders of
the group. ‘We play clubs, col-
leges, and dances, and it seems
like the places are filled every
time out.

“The band used to play coun-
try swing music, but in the past
few years we’ve moved to
swing. We do other music, too,
yet the crowds seem to really
like the older tunes.

Eight to the Bar will perform
in the Monte Carlo — roaring
20s area during Fancy Dress
Ball.

‘‘Swing is coming back. When
people are exposed to it, they
love it.” ,

Eight to the Bar is based in
New Haven, Conn. Its name is a
reference to the fact that much
of the boogie-woogie style is
based on musical combinations
of eight bars.

In addition, for much of its
six-year life, the group had
eight members.

Its first visit to Portland was
an engagement three years ago
at Bottoms Up and those early
appearances were winners.

The band now plays a half
dozen venues in southern
Maine, and the result is
generally the same: Once the
community hears about the
band, the seats are taken.

Their selections include such
nostalgic classics as ‘‘Boogie
Woogie Bugle Boy,” ‘‘Chat-
tanooga Choo-Choo,”’ ‘‘Take the
A Train,” and ‘‘In the Mood.”

Many bands could probably
play such fare, but few are
capable of such flair, such
authenticity.

Other songs worked in are

“South Street,”’ “Don’t Let Go” -

and a handful of originals.

Barbara Lyon, a_ striking
brunette, and Polly Messer, an
attractive blonde, are showcas-
ed on vocals. They play their
roles as if from another era, and
at times bring back the sound of
the Andrews Sisters.

Cynthia Lyon is on key-
boards, and also contributes
vocals.

Probably the most forceful of
the musicians is Paul Nigro on

of bringing out the hordes while

Yet Eight to the Bar is op-
timistic that there is a niche for
them on the national level.
‘We'd like to have the kind of
success of a group like Manhat-

plays with a verve and con-

crew that is unique in this area.

The popularity of the group is

quite well. In addition to club
and concert dates, we’ve been
chosen to entertain at Har-
vard’s Hasty Pudding awards
this year, and we’ll have an
album coming out this spring.

‘“‘We’ve worked hard to be
where we are, but I’d also say
we’re helped by the fact that
many people want to hear the
whole swing sound come back

BILLY PRICE
Soulful P-burg Singer
Hits the Big Time

Billy Price isn’t the most successful musician in Pittsburgh. He’s
not the highest paid. He doesn’t sell the most records. But folks,
there have been some damned bright lights reflected off those dark
glasses of his. In fact, it was only a few years ago that he was tour-
ing the U.S. and Canada, singing in the most prestigious halls.

The Cockpit is among those halls, and Price will appear there
Tuesday night of Fancy Dress week. :

The lights aren’t quite that bright these days. Billy Price and the
Keystone Rhythm Band is a popular act in Pittsburgh and a few
other places, but it’s extremely doubtful they could get booked at
the Stanley Theatre, let alone Carnegie Hall, where Price once
sang.

But the dimmer lights don’t seem to bother Billy Price. He’s
already had a taste of success. Maybe ‘‘dose”’ is a better word
because, you see, rather than a stairway that spiraled upward, suc-
cess for Billy Price became a ceiling that kept getting lower;
rather than an open sky filled with possibility, it turned out to be a
floor drain that sucked away his energy, creativity and confidence

- until finally, in a fit of desperation, he grabbed that hot spot light of

success, ripped it out, smashed it to pieces and silently walked
away.

Billy Price (nee: William Pollak) grew up outside Paterson, New
Jersey. Unlike his idols — people like Otis Redding, Bobby ‘“‘Blue”’
Biand, and James Brown — Billy can’t tell stories about picking
cotton or washing diner dishes as a child. He grew up ina nice, lily-
white suburb, the son of a prominent dentist and a housewife.

He always enjoyed listening to music, but rather than listening to
the latest pop hits by the Four Seasons, The Beatles, or the Beach
Boys, this young white kid was keeping his transistor tuned to the
black stations out of Newark and New York City. He stayed up late
at night waiting to hear what was being played in faraway places
like Memphis and Detroit. That rhythm-and-blues music came
through those tiny speakers, poured into his ears and trickled down
inside where it dropped some strong, deep roots.

As a teenager, he began sneaking off to New York City with a few
of his. older brother’s friends. He could get served in some of the
bars there. He could also see some of the bands and singers he had
been listening to at home. Like so many other guys during the six-
ties who couldn’t swing a baseball bat and didn’t know a down-and-
out from an up, up and away, Billy began dreaming of being a musi-
cian. It was a way to be popular. It was a way to meet girls. It was a
way to be somebody.

By ninth grade, he had learned many of the moves of those
smooth Motown singers. He got himself a gold satin shirt, some
green pin striped pants and a pair of pointed shoes. He also found
some guys who could play and didn’t mind dressing alike and form-
ed a band called ‘‘Billy and the Uptights.”” He was a showman from
the beginning.

In front of spotlights more suited for aluminum Christmas trees,
he did, among other things, an imitation of James Brown’s famous
“cape routine.” In that part of his act, Brown became so involved
with his performance that he seemed on the verge of losing control,
blowing a gasket, or suffering a stroke. But just in the nick of time,
two men would come out on stage, calm him down, wrap a cape
around him, and lead him away.

James Brown did it on national television. Billy Price did it at the
YMCA.

In high school, he sang and danced his way through a barrage of
homecomings and sock hops. When he went off to Penn State in the
late sixties, he began turning his microphone on at beer bashes and
frat parties. But Price didn’t go to college to study rock-and-roll,
rhythm-and-blues, or Ravel and Bach, for that matter. He hadn’t
considered making music his career. Price was in college to get his
English degree and become a man of letters.

But a few things popped up along the way that threatened to
change things, such as LSD and Buddhism. In fact, this sweating
soul singer went so far as to change his college major to religious
studies and plan a pilgrimage to China. Before he could do that,
though, that part of his brain where all the music played began to
heat up. In the bars around State College, he met other musicians
who had the same problem. They could only calm those strange
palpitations by getting together with their saxophones, guitars and
voices. When that happened, those brain waves started flowing to
the same rhythm, and it was a damned funky one at that. They
became the Rhythm Kings.

Doremus Gym: Beach and Soul Music

The key word in understan-
ding the VOLTAGE BROTH-
ERS is community. This
remarkable group of young
men. from the ghetto of
Rochester forms a community,
that transcends even their
spirited and varied music. And
a key to understanding this
community is their director-
mentor, Jerry Griffin.

Griffin, a former Marine
riflery instructor who
discovered that he _ liked

teaching young people, became
involved with the group when it
was a teenage band called
FUNKY HEAVY in Rochester
in the late ’60’s. He found them
because of his work with com-.
munity organizations. He is a
rabid supporter of self-help pro-
grams and that is what this
band has become — an attempt
at forming a unit that would
band together to rise above
societal problems. After much
travail, the VOLTAGE BROTH-
ERS succeeded. 3

The VOLTAGE BROTHERS
have been together as a band
for more than ten years. A
thirteen-man family, they in-
clude a horn section, rhythm
section, ten powerful voices,
and three equipment/sound
men. They have toured exten-
sively throughout the country
and now call Atlanta their
home.

‘he 1976 Producer Jerry Ross
heard the group and was so im-’
pressed by their talent and
energy that he brought them to
Lifesong Records where they
signed a major recording deal.

And Lifesong, insisting that
the group be represented by the
most professional management
possible, persuaded Sid
Seindenberg, President of SAS,
Inc. who hadn’t signed a group
to his management firm in two
years, to listen to the VOLT-
AGE BROTHERS. Once he and
his staff heard the group, it was
an instant marriage and the
VOLTAGE BROTHERS joined
Gladys Knight and the Pips,
B.B. King, and Gene McDaniels
on the SAS roster.

It is a tribute to the ten musi-
cians who are the VOLTAGE
BROTHERS that they have
come this far as a unit. Where
they are bound is stardom and
soon the VOLTAGE BROTH-
ERS family will be extended to
include an_ enthusiastic
worldwide audience.

Chairmen of the Board

No group creates excitement
like the Chairmen of the
Board. Their avid fans regular-
ly make road trips to ex-
perience the ‘“‘Electricity’’ of
“The Chairmen.”

From the first inkling that the
“Chairmen” are on their way to
the stage, the audience stands
in anxious anticipation to greet
them. The “Chairmen” have
such a command over an au-
dience that while some groups
have to ask the audience to sing
along, the “Chairmen” just
have to stop while the fans
carry on.

It all began for General Nor-
man Johnson, like so many
others before him, in the chur-
ch. At six years of age, General
Johnson began singing with his
father and gained experience in
the choir.

At the tender age of 12,
General Johnson gathered his
neighborhood buddies and
formed a group called the
‘‘Humdingers.”’ As far as fame
and fortune are concerned, they
may have not turned out to be
‘“‘Humdingers,” in the slang
definition sense of the word,
even though they recorded with
Atlantic Records. Nothing was
ever released.

During his last year of high
school, General Johnson
gathered Norfolk, VA buddies
once again — this time the
group’s name was the
“Showmen.”’ A recording con-
tract this time with Minit
Records produced five singles.
It was the first release, ‘‘It Will
Stand,’’ that has become an an-
them with beach music fans like
Danny & The Juniors’ ‘Rock &
Roll Is Here To Stay”’ has with
oldie fans. In an interview with
General Johnson, he said that
he did not know of the shag
when he wrote the line that
says, “‘little dances that look so

neat, you see why it will stand,”’
even though a Bop type dance
was prevalent in the Norfolk
area as he grew up. “It Will
Stand” has also been adopted as
the title of the only magazine
dedicated to the preservation of
Beach Music, published in
Charlotte, NC.

The Showmen’s last release
for Minit, another General
Johnson penned tune has
stirred up a controversy over
the title ‘‘39-21-46’’ as listed on
the record label. The song was

originally _— to be

 

€)
gore ae
&

“You Are So
ended up
**39-91-46’’ because the record

released as
Beautiful’’ and
producer felt it was more
‘‘marketable.”’

The Showmen moved from
Minit Records to Swan Records
for a short time, releasing three
discs, then Airerecords, Ins-
tant, and also recording for
Jokers 3 Productions of
Greensboro, NC, in 1967.

In 1968, General Johnson
began negotiations with Invic-
tus Records and producers
Holland, Dozier, Holland. In

1969, the Chairmen of the Board
were born. Even though
General Johnson was no longer
one of the ‘‘Showmen,”’ he was
definitely a ‘‘SHOWman.”
Another ‘SHOWman” became
an integral part of the
Chairmen of The Board, Danny
Woods. Other members were
Eddie Custis and Harrison Ken-
nedy.

The road has kept the
“Chairmen’’ very busy for the
last few years, but not enough to
keep them from releasing
gigantic southeastern beach

 

classics such as ‘On The
Beach,’ ‘Pretty Women
Everywhere (Hey Baby),”’
“Carolina Girls,” and more.
The Chairmen of The Board
take control of an audience like
an executive bringing a board
meeting to order with a 20 lb.
gavel. To see the Chairmen of
The Board is a treat. To have
not ever experienced the excite-
ment and the electricity of the
Chairmen of The Board, is like
not ever having a hot dog all-
the-way or an extra slice of
mom's apple pie on Sunday.

BEFORE........
ARS Thursday Night

Atlanta Rhythm Section will
perform in Cameron Hall at
VMI as part of W&L’s Fancy
Dress Weekend. Tickets for the
March 4 show will cost $3 for
W&L students.

There is something very
familiar and reassuring in the
sound of Atlanta Rhythm Sec-
tion holding forth across the air-
waves year after year, a consis-
tent output that few groups
—Northern, Southern, British,
you name it — are able to
match. It is hard to recall a mo-
ment during the last four years
when ARS wasn’t keeping its
hybrid brand of rock ’n roll at
the very top of the charts, star-
ting with 1977’s ‘‘So In to You,”’
then the following year with
“Imaginary Lover” and “I’m
Not Gonna Let It Bother Me
Tonight,” and yet again with
“Do It or Die” and their remake
of ‘‘Spooky”’ in ’79.

There are always those folks
who'd argue that any group
with the collective strengths of
ARS couldn’t possibly lose: the
individual talents of each musi-
cian in the band, all quiet
veterans of the studio session
wars long before they’d got
together in the band; the
awesome songwriting abilities
of the band members collabor-
ating with their producer-
manager Buddy Buie through
the years; and the full-time use
of one of the finest recording
facilities in the country
—Doraville, Georgia’s Studio
One — manned by associate
producer-engineer Rodney

Mills, long since named ‘‘one of
rock ’n roll’s great natural
resources”’ by ARS.

Those all-too-humanh
strengths (tempered by a
righteous bit of Southern soul)

are a QUINELLA you can bet .

your hard-earned money on, as
the title of their lucky 11th
album suggests. The Atlanta
Rhythm Section joins Columbia
Records in 1981 with an LP that
more than does justice ot the
classic ARS sounds of the past,
from the very first single to
jump off side one, ‘Alien.’

Not only can you sense the
resolutin of so many dues-
paying years as this musical
QUINELLA Plays its hand, but
there’s also a strong feeling for
the future in terms of staying
true to that past. ARS fans are
always reminded of a summer
September three years ago,
with ‘Imaginary Lover”’ as the
season’s theme song, when the
band returned home to Atlanta
after a hot tour. They were
greeted in the city streets like
heroes, and played in front of
60,000 people that day at the
Campagne Jam Festival in
Grant Field, headlinging over
Santana, Eddie Money, and the
Doobie Brothers. The same
month, September 25th it was,
Chip Carter brought them to the
White House where family and
friends came to hear them. ‘I
think I have a lot in common
with the Atlanta Rhythm Sec-
tion,’’ the President said that
afternoon.

veces AFTER
Offenders at Zollman’s

Bruce Olsen and his band are
posing real problems for enter-
tainment editors and concert
reviewers alike. No one knows
exactly how to label the band’s
sound. The writers compare
them to David Bowie and the
Stones, but the terms of com-
parison are always ‘‘almost’’ or
“somewhat” and never quite
definite.

Take the facts. The band
sports the name Bruce Olsen
and The Offenders. Their play
list heavily patronizes the early
Stones, Elvis Costello and The
Talking Heads. And the band’s
four members boast the aliases
Bruce Ogre, Chris Stink, Com-
mander, and Rick Gruesome.
Put the data together. With un-
doubtedly punkish names, a
playlist full of New Wave and a
group title along the line of The
Heartbreakers or The Attrac-
tions, you think you’ve got them
pegged alright.

Wrong. Make way for ‘‘Jock
rock,’’ a name Olsen himself
labeled The Offenders’ music.
His reviewers always include
the unusual term, but to clear
things up for readers, the sound

is good old rock and roll. To
quote a Florida reviewer, ‘‘it’s
full of punk, power and pizazz.”’

Put that on the data card. And
add to it a Bowieish stage show
featuring the 6’5” lead guitarist
and vocalist, Olsen, dominating
the floor with a stage presence
that has been likened to the
wildly mobile, gesticulatory,
growing performance of Jagger
— a combination that Olsen
picked up through past ex-
perience and one that he says
has been especially appealing
to the same constituency
Springsteen directs his music
to.

The reviewers might be
sweating it out over the choice
of terms but Bruce Olsen and
The Offenders just get down to
doing what they do best. Having
just finished a stint in New York
and now before heading down
South for an extended tour, the
band will be playing here in
Charlottesville Thursday night
at Poe’s.

“Jock rock.’’ You won’t find it
in the dictionary. Come try to
define it from the dance floor.

Last season, the Washington#
and Lee basketball team went®
on a season-ending three-game ™
Old Dominion Athletic Con-g
ference road-trip with a 16-6
record and returned with a 16-9
mark.

This year, the squad left for
the identical trip at 17-5, won
two of the three contests and
closed their regular season with
a 19-6 record, tied for first place
with Roanoke in the ODAC and
ranked 18th in the latest NCAA
Division III basketball poll.

“‘That’s one heck of a job for a
transition team,”’ smiled head
fa coach Verne Canfield.

But now the second season
s—the tournaments — begins.

W&L, seeded second by the
ODAC’s tie-breaking system,
will host Eastern Mennonite

College at 7:30 tonight in the

Warner Center in the ODAC

quarterfinals. The Generals |

dispatched Mennonite 84-74 and —
| 71-51 during the regular season, ©
_ but the Royals, who finished |
11-13, 4-10 in the ODAC, boast ©
the conference’s top scorer in
‘Stephfan Allen (22.4) and the
top rebounder in Larry Sheets -
(13.96).
, “We must continue our good
team defense,” said Canfield.
“‘We must execute basic things
like boxing out. A key will be
how many second and third
shots we prevent them from
getting. We need to set the tem-
po. We played well against
them before, but we are playing @
better now. We’re closer to our
potential.

“It is a great advantage play- #
ing at home,” he continued.
‘“‘We’ve worked very hard for
the home court advantage, but
if no one comes, we may as well
be playing in Timbuktu. ”’

The Generals gained momen-
tum for the tourney by downing
Shenandoah in a_ non-con-
ference game 78-61, Mennonite
71-51, and Maryville 66-61 in
fovertime. The loss came to
Roanoke 83-67. Ee

— “To win in overtime on the
road is something in itself,”
said Canfield of the Maryville
victory which ended the regular
season. It was the Generals’ se- , :
cond overtime triumph of the aoa
year, both on the road, with no . wi eo:
overtime losses.

Down 27-25 at the half, W&L §
»,came back to tie the score at 53
to set up the overtime period.
Actually, Maryville had a
chance to win but missed a free
throw with 12 seconds left, and
the Generals were unable to get
off a shot before the buzzer.
Junior Frank Eppes and sopho-
more Billy Yates scored 22
points each for Washington and
Lee, and John Lee Graves, who,
along with Brian Hanson, pulled
down seven rebounds, added 11.
W&L shot 54.2 percent from the
field to the Scots 46 percent.
“Our defense took them out of
their offensive patterns,’ ex-
| plained Canfield. ;

Only shooting 39.3 percent
from the floor in the first half,
tee the Generals only led Eastern
Mennonite 25-24 at the intermis-
sion. The Royals had built a#

  
 
 
   
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

 
  
 
  
   
  

  
 
 
 
 
 
 

‘and Hanson’s bucket with three
seconds remaining gave W&L
the lead they would never relin
-__, quish.

In fact, from that point on, it”
wasn’t even close. Canfield
“discussed” a few things with —
he team at the half, and they ©
came out and simply destroyed. —
Mennonite. Ten straight points,
eight of them by Graves, sealed
he outcome with the Generals
up 58-40 at the 3:52 mark. |
‘In the first half, it was justa J
case of the shots not dropping §
in,” said Canfield. ‘‘When that
happens, you must concentrate
on some other phase of the
game and the shooting will take
care of itself.’’ It certainly did,

REVIEW and O

 

 

| Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Housing Woes

Once again we have returned from a vacation. Once
| again, we have crime stories to report. It seems that
| W&L going on vacation means a field day on break-
ins around Lexington.

| At a glance, the obvious solution would be to tighten
_ security while the student body is on vacation. We

believe that this may not be the only solution,
| however.

| This year, the administration decided to cram as
many freshman as feasible into the three dormitories

"across the street from Graham-Lees. The result has

| been a shortage of housing for upperclassmen and
law students.

What is alarming is that upperclassmen not living
_ in fraternities do not have much of a selection for

housing. Houses in the country are easy targets for .

thieves. The same goes for some housing in the city.
Even the fraternities are risky, since criminals know
they can find a large assortment of goods in each
house. What’s a person to do?

Once way to improve the situation would be a com-
mittee, consisting of students and adminstrators, that
_ could examine this problem. Many faculty members

remember what it was like to live in Lexington during

their college days. With the imput of students who are
currently facing this dilemma, the committee might
be able to reach some alternatives.

Living in a small town should at least include safe

A display of documents and
photographs tracing the history
of the Ann Smith Academy from
its earliest stages to the present
is currently on exhibit in the
Boatwright Room of the Univer-
sity Library at Washington and
Lee.

The display opened Monday,
February 15 and will continue
through the end of April. The
Boatwright Room, located on
lower level one of the Universi-
ty Library, is open from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. Monday through Fri-
day

Organized in 1807, the Ann
Smith Academy was the second
oldest incorporated girls’ school
in Virginia. The original school

building was situated on the

corner of Lee and Nelson
Streets in Lexington where the
Chi Psi fraternity house is
located now. The academy re-
mained in operation almost
without interruption for 96
years.

Narrative for the library
display was prepared by Dr.
William W. Pusey III, emeritus
‘dean and professor of German
at Washington and Lee. Pusey,

Dear Sir: |

I want to express my intense
displeasure with the E.C.’s ir-
responsible use of student
funds. When your illustrious
publication announced that the
E.C. was spending over $55,000
on a dance, I assumed that the
Phi had made an un-
characteristic typographical
error. When I learned to my
horror that the E.C. was indeed
spending over one-twentieth of
a million dollars solely on
alcoholic entertainment, the
sheer folly of it all started me
thinking of alternative uses for
our money. Although I realize
that some money comes from
admission fees, here are a few
of my suggestions on what the
E.C. can do with student funds
instead of wasting them on
frivolous things such as Fancy
Dress: ;

(1) Buy “Sweet Things’ and

give students free ice cream

when it snows.

(2) Give every member of the
E.C. a Renault “Le Car’ for
Christmas.

(3) Give the money to Presi-
dent Reagan to help him
balance the U.S. budget.

(4) Put the money in Cer-
tificates of Deposit and pay
every member of the Class of
1982 three dollars a year for life.

(5) Give President and Mrs.
Huntley a Mercedes as a going
away gift.

(6) Increase the budget of the
Ring-tum Phi so it doesn’t have
to accept condom adver-
tisements.

(7) Establish a faculty chair
to study the psychotic effects on
teenagers of all-male institu-
tions.

(8) Buy five new police cars
for the Lexington Police Dept.
so some zany, fun-loving frater-

who has written several studies
dealing with the history of
WAL, is the author of a paper on
‘‘Lexington’s Female
Academy”? to appear in
Virginia Calvalcade and is cur-
rently conducting further
research on the Ann Smith
Academy.

Documents in the display in-
clude the original minute book
for the Academy, a copy of the
act of incorporation in 1808, a
conduct book in which ‘“‘dis-
grace marks’ were recorded
opposite the names of the
students, and a journal that
records a list of subscriptions to

The Washington and Lee
University Glee Club will be
joined by the Lexington High
School Choir in a concert in Lee
Chapel at 8 p.m. tonight:

The concert is free and open
to the public.

The concert marks the first
time that the two outstanding
groups have appeared together.

Included on the program will
be a combined performance of
Randall Thompson’s “Frostian-

 

nity members can run them into
the War Memorial.

(9) Buy a U.S. Congressman.

(10) Buy Davidson Park Apts.
and invite 5000 Haitian and
Cuban refugees to move to Lex-
ington.

(11) Construct a huge’ sound-
proof plastic bubble and rent it
to fraternities to put over their
houses so parties could continue
until, dare I say, 2:00 a.m.

(12) Send the entire E.C. on
an all expense paid trip to El
Salvador for a month.

on the poetry of Robert Frost.

In addition, the W&L Glee
Club will perform Kodali’s
“The Peacocks” and ‘“‘The Last
Words of David,’’ also by Ran-
dall Thompson.

The W&L Glee Club is
directed by Dr. Gordon Spice
while Charles Torian conducts
the Lexington High School
Choir. Theresa Zybko will be |

. the accompanist.

Spending Suggestions Made

(13) Buy 1200 M-16 rifles and a
surplus M-60 tank and attack
V.M.LI.

(14) Give a senior physics stu-
dent a grant to build an atomic
bomb and then blackmail the
Lexington town council into
abolishing the noise ordinance.

(15) Have a wienie roast and
invite everyone in Virginia.

Now of course these are only
suggestions. The E.C. is free to
do what they want with our
money and I suppose a showing
of Washington and Lee
students’ complete lack of
academic concern is just as
good as supporting a library or
scholarship fund, or donating
money to the United Way. If
Washington and Lee cannot be
the best at academics, it might
as well be the best at something
else.

Respectfully yours,
Drew Demaray ’83L

 

 

 

Students’ Work Praised

Dear Phi,

In my opinion, not enough is
said about the positive interac-
tion which occurs cross cam-
pus. As examples I need only
point to the work of two
undergraduate EC committees.

Mike Drinkwater and the rest
of the Contact committee
members have just recently
provided us with the opportuni-
ty to hear two excellent legal
thinkers at Lee Chapel: F. Lee
Bailey and Arthur Miller.

The work of the Student Ac-
tivities Board has been par-
ticularly outstanding this year.
I doubt you will find people to
replace the likes of John Martin

and Bobby Schmidt for some
time to come. They have helped
us organize our own social ac-

‘tivities on a number of occa-

sions as well as doing an ex-
cellent job on their main
responsibilities across the
ravine.

The Tuesday night concert
series in the Cockpit has been
particularly entertaining
—often providing better enter-
tainment than can be found on
the weekends in Lexington, We
appreciate it.

Sincerely,
Tom Gearen
President,
Student Bar Association

Student Bar Announces It Will Raise Dues

by Ben Jarratt

The Student Bar Association
will raise its dues from $10 to
$20 next year to supplement a
strained budget. The subcom-
-Mittee presented its monthly
budget report Monday night to
the Executive Committee.

The E.C. also heard reports
from the Calyx, the Washington
and Lee Political Review and
the Ariel.

Tom Gearen, president of the
SBA, said “‘the main reason for
the dues increase is because
we’ve been cannibalizing other

Freshman’s Room Hit

Two Times Over Holiday

by Tom Baker

One Washington and Lee stu-
dent’s room was broken into
twice over the recent
Washington Holiday.

Brian McCausland, a fresh-
man living in Lee House II on
Lee Avenue reported that some-
one entered his room while he
was on vacation and stole cash
and goods totalling over $170.

The intruder apparently
picked a lock to enter through
one of the room’s doors and then
proceeded to rip the hinges and
chains off a closet door. Inside
the closet, McCausland had left
over $70 in tapes and approx-
imately $100 in cash. The break-
in apparently occured on Mon-
day, Feb. 15.

Although McCausland and his
roomate were away during the
break, Kevin McClatchy,
another freshman, was staying
in the room. McClatchy was not
present at the time of the break-
in, but reported the crime to
Lexington police.

The second break-in occured
on Saturday, Feb. 20, sometime
between 7 and 8 p.m. At that
time, someone apparently
broke down the front door
leading onto McCausland’s
room and stole his stereo
receiver. A witness claimed to
see a man wearing an orange
backpack leaving the area at
that time. Again, McClatchy
was out at that time.

Police .said they are in-
vestigating both break-ins.

Mollenhoff Gives Speech

Clark R. Mollenhoff, pro-
fessor of journalism at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, addressed the subject of ex-
ecutive privilege in a speech to
the Sigma Delta Chi/Society of
Professional Journalists at the
University of Central Florida in
Orlando recently.

Mollenhoff, who testified on
the subject of executive
privilege before a congressional

subcommittee last year, drew
comparisons between
‘government-press relations in
the United States and in Britain.

On Wednesday, March 3,

active social committee. Four
committees funded last year
are no longer being funded.

‘Most of the raise will go to
social,” stated Gearen, ‘“‘but
some will replenish the funds
cut from other committees.
When tuition is increased $600 a
year, most people won’t object
toa $10 raise.”

Gearen said the SBA is sup-
porting professor Samuel
Calhoun to get tenure. The SBA
is also funding a ‘Sloppy
Dress”’ party as an alternative
for law students who prefer not
to attend Fancy Dress.

Calyx

Scott Fitzgerald, business
manager of the Calyx, said the
records were
destroyed in a fire two weeks

.ago. Fitzgerald said the W&L

Business Office was willing to
go back through their records to
compile the lost records. E.C.
Vice-president Jim Averett said
he had a computer printout of

‘their

subcommittee expenditures
that could be of some assist-
ance.

Jack Huskin, editor of the
Calyx, said the final deadline is
March 5 — Fancy Dress. It will
cost about $30 a page extra to in-
clude the weekend in the year-
book. He said any fraternity
member who has pictures of
fraternity activities
should feel free to submit them
to the Calyx.

Political Review

Eric Anderson reported the
Washington and Lee Political
Review should be out by the
first week in April. 15 authors,
including two professors, sub-
mitted articles. The Review will
go to the printers next week and
final expenses will be known at
that time.

Ariel

Andrew Trotter said the
Spring edition of the Ariel has a
March 15 deadline. He also
reported that the Publications
Board has purchased a used

enlarger for the darkroom. The

_ two-year-old model cost $400.

Leonard Howard said the
Library Advisory Committee is
acquiring audio-visual equip-
ment for the University
Library.

Averett said the Virginia Stu-
dent Association spoke to him
about a bill requiring smoke
detecters in dormitories. The
E.C. decided to let the ad-
ministration handle this mat-
ter.

Averett added the Big Three
elections will be held Monday,
March 8. Petitions are due at
6:30 p.m. in the E.C. room on
March 1.

in the season, they out-re-
bounded the Maroons 42-25. At
Roanoke, however, the tables
were turned as_ the hosts
dominated the boards 40-29 en
route to the 83-67 victory.
‘Roanoke was highly motiva-
ted,’ said Canfield, who added
that the rebounding statistic
basically tells the story.

A Hanson basket gave the
Generals a 20-10 lead midway
through the first half, but the
Maroons came back to take the
lead for good at 27-26 and had
upped that to 41-35 by the half.
About the only bright spot for
W&L was the fact that they only
committed eight turnovers.
Yates lead the squad with 16
points, and Eppes added 15 and
Hanson 14.

Eppes scored a career-high 24
points on a 10-11 performance
from the floor and a 4-4 mark
from the foul line to lead the

team to the 78-61 victory over
Shenandoah. The Generals
trailed at 6-2 but tallied ten con-
secutive points and never look-
ed back.

The 6-10 center averaged
18.25 points for the four games
to raise his season average to
9.2. Canfield also cited the re-
cent play of Yates, saying,
‘‘He’s playing basketball the
way I knew he could all along.”

In comparing this year’s
season-ending triumphs to last
year’s virtual collapse, Canfield
said, ‘‘The guys have put ina lot
of hard work, and they’ve
responded to the demands I’ve
put on them as-a team. I’ve
worked them a little harder,
and they’ve responded.

“It has been a very satisfying
year to this point.”’

He also praised the contribu-
tions of some of his younger
players: ‘‘We have five

fee of $1.00 for students and

the number of matches over
last year from 12 to 14. Navy
and Syracuse, two teams that
finished in the U.S.I.L.A. top
ten, will be new competition
from last season as well as the
addition of Duke and Lafayette.

Six of the Generals’ 14 games
this season are with top ten
finishers. In addition to Navy
and Syracuse there will be N.C.
State, Virginia, U.M.B.C., and
national champs North Caro-

“we've always felt that the bet-

“We don’t have as much

more controlled game instead
of a run and gun type offense.”’

To help maintain this control

John Sancilio and juniors John

defensemen that return off of
last’ year’s squad. Coming up
from the junior varsity to add

“We're ready to play the
others any time,’’ said Emmer.

The Outlook

The Generals have a big
challenge in the 1982 schedule
and will have to play at a con-
sistently high level, having to go
against the best competition in
the nation each week of the
season.

‘The key to the season,’’ said
Emmer, “‘is taking advantage
of our personnel. We've got a lot
of young kids that will be
coming along.

‘“‘We believe we can be suc- -
cessful by taking one game at a
time. We've got enough ex-
perience to control the ball and
make people do what we want
them to.”’

Swimmers Win 2 Of 3, Move Over .500

by Andrew P. Hoppes

W&L’s swimming team has’
fulfilled one of its major goals
for the season by finishing
above .500 with a 6-5 record.

The Generals secured the
winning Season by winning two
of the three contests over the
Washington’s birthday break.
The Generals topped Virginia
Commonwealth College, 62-49,
and Georgetown, 65-35, before
dropping a 65-48 decision to
Glassboro State.

One of the highlights in the
VCU meet was provided by
freshman Bobby Pearson.
Pearson swam a strong anchor-
lap in the 400-yard freestyle
relay to key a W&L win in the
event.

Small College
Award Goes
To Cavalline

Chris Cavalline, a Wash-
ington and Lee University foot-
ball standout from St. Mary’s,
Pa., received the Richmond
Touchdown Club’s ‘1981 Small
College Offensive Player-of-the-
Year’ award on Wednesday,
January 20 at the Club’s 19th an-
nual awards dinner. The junior
tailback is believed to be the
first W&L player recognized by
the Club.

‘‘When he accepted the honor,
he mentioned that it belonged
as much to his teammates as it
did to him. That’s the type of
student-athlete he is —
unselfish — as indicated by the
fact he’s been elected one of our
team tri-captains for 1982.”’

Cavalline finished the 1981
campaign with 765 yards and
seven touchdowns on 235
rushing attempts, 221 yards on
23 pass receptions, and a 35.0-
yard average on 36 punts. He
also completed three of five
passes for 58 yards as. the
Generals posted an 8-2 record
(their best since 1962) and won
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference title. In November,
Cavalline received the ODAC’s
Player-of-the-Year honor.

‘‘Thanks to help from Chris,
we enjoyed a prosperous cam-
paign,”’ remarked Fallon, who
completed his fourth year at the
W&L helm.

Mike Bernot and Rand McClain
and two Glassboro State swim-
mers whose best times in the 50-
yard freestyle ranked them se-
cond arid third nationally.

Bernot and McClain faired
‘well against the nationally
ranked swimmers, with Bernot
first in the 50 and 100, and Mc-
Clain third and second, respec-
tively.

The Generals also competed

in the UNC-Wilmington Invita-

Honor McKee

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity football standout John B.
McKee, from Clarksdale, Miss.,
recently received prestigious
honors from the National Foot-
ball Foundation & Hall of Fame
(NFFHF) and from the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon National Frater-
nity.

McKee received the NF-
FHF’s NCAA Division III
Scholar-Athlete award, one of
two small college honors
bestowed by the Foundation,
which provides a_ $1000
fellowship for post-graduate
studies. Sigma Alpha Epsilon
placed McKee on its 25-member
Small College All-America
team to mark the second con-
secutive year he has received

the honor. 1981 marked the 43rd .

year for the team, which is
chosen by SAE football alumni
from across the country.

“There aren’t enough adjec-
tives to describe this young
man,” offers Washington and
Lee head coach Gary Fallon.

In addition to his football
status, he is an accomplished
shot put performer for the W&L
track squad, placing first in the
event at the 1981 Old Dominion
Athletic Conference Indoor
Championships and second at
the 1981 ODAC Outdoor Cham-
pionships.

Wrestlers Take Four
Straight, Finish At 8-6

by John Harrison

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team completed a
successful season by taking all
four of its final matches. The 8-6
finish marks a significant im-
provement considering that the
past two teams _ produced
records of 4-9 and 3-8.

University of Richmond. Wes

(fall), and Jeff Dixon (fall) con-
tributed to a 31-20 defeat of the
Spiders.

Two days later in.the Warner
Center, the Generals defeated
Lynchburg 30-21 and Hampden-
Sydney 24-20. Payne (8-6), Dix-
on (14-4), Joe O’Neill (6-0), cap-
tain Tim Valliere (11-0) and
Carlton Peebles were winners
against the Tigers, while five
forfeits by Lynchburg in the up-
per weights were solely respon-

sible for giving W&L tue deci-
sion over the Hornets.

The season concluded on Feb.
16 as Longwood fell to the
Generals 28-18. Ron Thornton

(15-9), Dixon (5-3), Peebles
(5-1) and O’Neill (fall) led the
way for W&L.

Head coach Gary Franke was
pleased with this year’s turn-
around but at the same time
emphasizes that there still is
room for improvement. ‘After
two losers,” said the coach, ‘‘we
made a respectable showing.
We’ll just have to set our sights
higher for next year.”’

Franke also expressed disap-
pointment that none of the six
representatives from W&L in
the NCAA Division Regionals
qualified for the Nationals. Tim
Valliere and Jeff Dixon were
runners-up in the 158 and 177
pound divisions, respectively,
and Greg Kendrick finished
third at 167.

QDAC Championships
This Weekend

Freshmen will play a key role
this Saturday, Febuary 27,when
the Washington and Lee Univer-
sity track team indoor track
team competes in the sixth an-
nual Old Dominion Athletic
Conference meet Championship
meet at Lynchburg College. The
Generals, who placed third at
last winter’s championships,
will joinBridgewater, Roanoke,
Emory and Henry, and Lynch-
burg College at the 14-event
meet.

‘Due to last spring’s gradua-
tion and to injuries this winter,
we'll count_on freshmen to fill
some big shoes in the running
events in this meet,’’ states
12th-year Head Coach Norris
Aldridge, who points to Chris
Ives, Chris Busbee, Scott
Henderson, Martin Pruitt,

Frank Pittman, and Mark Pem-
broke as the key candidates.

W&L’s upper class com-
petitors include junior captain
Alan Armitage, senior captain
Russ Rector, and senior John
McKee. Armitage placed se-
cond in the 60-yard high hurdles
at the 1981 ODAC meet-and is a
favorite for first place this
year” according to Aldridge.
Rector placed second in the tri-
ple jump and fifth in the high
jump last winter. McKee won
the shot put competition last
year ‘‘ but will be pushed this
year by Lynchburg’s entry”’ ac-
cording to the coach. Another
W&L defending champion
junior Gene Fellin inthe pole
vault, is questionable due to a
leg injury.

_Entertainment
A Quick Dip ‘On Golden Pond’

Review:

by Todd Jones

On Golden Pond is a story
about an old married couple on
vacation in New England. The
husband is a bitter old man
obsessed with death. His
daughter, whom he never was
particularly fond of, comes for
a visit and leaves her fiancee’s
son with the couple for a month.

The movie chooses to focus on
the relationship that evolves
between the old man and the
boy and how the boy, working
with the old man’s wife,
changes the old man’s attitudes
on life and death.

The old man is played, of
course, by Henry Fonda.
Almost the entire film circles
around him and he is excellent.
Jane Fonda, as the daughter,
also gives an excellent perfor-
mance. Ms. Fonda is bitter
about her childhood and is con-
vinced that her father hates
her. Her part in the film is quite
small and most of the time she
can be found in a bathing suit.
Both Jane and Henry have been

nominated for Academy
Awards, making possible the

first-ever father/daughter com-

bination(in 1948, John and
Walter Huston were the first
and only father/son team to win
Oscars).

The matriarch of the family is
portrayed by none other than
Katherine Hepburn. Her
character is a cheerful woman
whose only goal in life seems to
cheer and support her husband.
Hepburn too was nominated for
an Oscar. Her performance is
good, but not perhaps up to the
usual Hepburn standard.

Supporting this cast of
cinematic heavyweights is
dependable Dabney Coleman,
who plays Jane Fonda’s lover.
His part is very small and most
of the time he seems uncomfor-
table around these luminaries.

The cast as a whole does an
excellent acting job, however.
Mark Rydell, the director,
lessens the film’s effect by mak-
ing it too soggy, too tear-jerky.

Still, there are some excellent

scenes. One in particular has
the elderly Fonda out picking

strawberries when, all of a sud-
den, he realizes he is lost. Fon-

da’s portrayal of a man lost ona
trail he has walked a thousand
times is outstanding.

Unfortunately, Rydell has a
tendency to make every scene a
tragic, poignant statement on
life. Rydell’s handling of more
comical scenes are more adept
than his attempts to lay a lot of
pathos on the audience.

On Golden Pond was
nominated for 10 Academy
Awards including Best Picture,
Best Actor and Actress, Best
Director, Best Screenplay, Best
Editing, Best Cinematography
and Original Score. Oh yes,
Jane is up for Best Supporting
Actress.

With the hype this film has
received and the sentimental
pull for veterans Fonda and
Hepburn, the movie is likely to.
walk away with a few of these
awards.

An exhibition of 19th-century
wood engravings by artist
Winslow Homer will open in
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s duPont Gallery on Friday,
February 26.

Homer had been an appren-
tice to a Boston lithographer,
using his drawing talents for
tedious and routine copy work.
Within two years, he quit and
embarked on a career as a free-
lance illustrator.

His first published work ap-
peared in ‘‘Ballou’s Pictorial
Drawing-Room Companion” in
1857. At about the same time, a
new illustrated magazine,
‘‘Harper’s,’’ was starting up
and successfully attracted the
best writers and illustrators.
Homer submitted works to
‘‘Harper’s’” beginning a long

Shown In duPont

association during which the
magazine printed almost
everything Homer submitted,
occasionally on the cover. |
‘Although his main interest
began to shift towards painting,
for which he is perhaps best

_ known today, Homer continued

his magazine career,’’ explains
Estelle Porter, the Virginia
Museum’s state services coord-
inator. ‘““His work as a print-
maker had taught him the
disciplined use of black and
white elements in his composi-
tions. It also forced him to
simplify details, to ooncentrate
on essentials, and to develop his
surface with clearly-defined
forms bathed in natural light.”
According to Porter, Homer’s
work, as seen in the duPont ex-
hibition, ‘‘transcends mere
commercial illustration.”

 

 

 

Nillinger At Happy How

If your diet of live entertain-
ment consists largely of urbane
cabaret singers who trade dark
secrets in dark rooms, then
country singer-song-writer-
guitarist Willie Nininger will-
appear as a cool, lighthearted
relief.

Over the past four years he
has appeared on his own, with
various members of his family
and as opening act for the
heavyweight likes of Livingston
Taylor, Lori Lieberman, Aztec
Two-Step, Pete Seeger and Jim-
my Buffet at colleges and in cof-

fee houses and concert halls
along the East Coast.

Like many Sixties teenagers
with musical predilections, Nin-
inger, in eighth grade, began
playing in local bands in Briar-
cliff, New York. He graduated
from Tufts University (where
he also taught a Song and
Songwriters course at the Ex-
perimental College) in 1974 with
a BA in English.

Check out Willie Ninger in the
Cockpit this Friday, February
26th during Happy Hour.

The Deal Here Saturday

Charlottesville has tradi-
tionally been the home of great
music. From New Wave to
Southern Rock, a multitude of
bands provide entertainment
for a teeming college town.
Even with this great number of
bands, Charlottesville’s atten-
tion has been seized this year by
The Deal.

The Deal is a vocally-oriented
pop-rock band. By performing
their own music they have
become immensely popular and
have broken all-time atten-
dance records at several clubs.

There are five members of
The Deal. Eric Schwartz and
Mark Roebuck play rhythm
guitar and Haines Fullerton
plays lead. The band’s bass
player is Jim Jones while. per-
cussion is supplied by Hugh
Patton. Jim, Mark, Eric and

Haines all sing, combining to
give’ the band a_ unique,
harmony-oriented vocal sound.

The Deal is expanding their
listening market with predic-
table success. Their perfor-
mances are guaranteed to pro-
vide audiences with energetic,
first-rate entertainment.

Saturday’s concert begins at 9
p.m. and should last to 1 a.m. A
$1 cover will be taken at the
door.

‘Utopia’
On Stage

“‘Utopia,’’ a one-act comedy
written and directed by
Washington and Lee senior
Peter Moody, will be presented
tonight through Saturday at the

Skip Castro Concert Site Moved

Skip Castro is scheduled to be
the ‘‘mystery’’ guest at the Fan-
cy Dress Ball. Due to some
technical difficulties, Skip will
still play at midnight, but will
appear in Doremus Gym rather
than Warner Center.

When it comes to introduc-
tions, The Skip Castro Band
doesn’t mess around. Their
music is equally straightfor-
ward as the four Charlottesville

musicians deliver a_ no-frills
rhythm and blues performance.

The Skip Castro Band’s cof-
feehouse concerts are delivered
with gut-level punch before.an
enthusiastic crowd.

Although the band was form-
ed less than two years ago, The
Skip Castro Band has earned a
devout regional following,

largely due to a reputation for
knocking out frathouse crowds

Guitarist Bo Randall and

off with the NRBQ version of

a two-hour performance with

Add to that skillfully exeouted
challengers like Little Feat’s
“Fat Man. in the Bathtub,”
Elvis Costello’s ‘Lip Service’
and a couple of interesting
original compositions, and you
have a surprisingly varied for-
mat for an R&B bar band.

“Twelve-Bar songs tend to
get people going faster when
they’re drinking,” says bassist
Charlie Pastorfield. ‘‘No com-
plications.” But when they -
aren't plugging away at
lengthy, uncomplicated ver-
sions of “Kansas City’ or
“Justine,” The Skip Castro
Band introduces some genuine-
ly creative material.
“Camera,”’ for example, writ-
ten by keyboardist Dan Beirne,
demonstrated that bar bands
can perform unique music.

After several months of seem-
ingly unending winter weather,
_ Washington and Lee students
will be given a break this
weekend when the school
celebrates this weekend’s 75 an-
nual Fancy Dress Ball.

The F.D. festivities, which
begin with tonight’s concert in
Cameron Hall by the Atlanta
Rhythm Section, promise to be
three days of fun and merri-
ment for all partakers.

The ARS concert is only one
of several musical _perfor-
mances, which vary from the
big band sound of Lester Lanin
to the soul and beach music of
the Voltage Brothers and
Chairmen of the Board.

Fancy Dress is normally a
special time at Washington and
Lee, and the 1982 ball is of par-
ticular note since it is the 75 an-
niversary of the founding of the
winter dance/party in 1907 by
Miss Annie Jo White. Naturally,
the theme of this year’s ball is
“Fancy Dress 1982: A Diamond
Jubilee.”’

Being a special anniversary
and all, the ball has undergone

some changes. First, Friday

relocated in Doremus

to an end the cramped tradition
of the Student Center. The
S.A.B. has moved to larger
facilities to provide all forms of

entertainment for the guests.

The featured performer is
Lester Lanin, an _ orchestra
leader noted for his connections
with the First Couple and
various bigwhigs in the Big Ap-
ple. Lanin will perform from
8:30 to approximately midnight
in Warner Center.

Thursday night’s concert has
also been moved to more
spacious locale. Last year
featured concert, John Prine,
was held in Warner Center. This
year, ARS will be given more
breathing room in V.M.I.’s
Cameron Hall.

Inside the gym, the S.A.B. has
provided a bevy of musical
treats.

Those seeking faster and
more contemporary music will
find just that in the sounds of
the Voltage Brothers and
Chairmen of the Board. The
bands will occupy stages at op-
posite ends of the old gym.

For those who do not par-
ticularly like the sounds of
beach or soul, relief is on the
way in the form of Skip Castro.

will start up in the old, not the
new, gym.

While music is echoing below,
F.D. strollers can take in the
‘“‘theme’’ rooms which will be
located on the 500 level of the
gym. The themes, drawn from
F.D.’s of the past (this is
supposed to be a retrospect)
will include ‘‘Gay Paris,” “The
Roaring Twenties,’ and
‘Monte Carlo Night.”

If Friday and Thursday’s
events are not enough, there is
always the rest of the weekend,
including a Saturday afternoon
grain party at Zollman’s that
features the Offenders and
various parties Saturday night
and Sunday. Clearly, Fancy
Dress has progressed beyond
the level of a one-night gala.

Perhaps the best indication of
the popularity of this event is
the quick movement of sales
this past week. F.D. tickets, at
$25 apiece, have been moving
fast all week. The ARS concert,
which offered seats at $3 apiece,
had sold 500 seats on the first
day of ticket sales.

Applications for a new ex-
change program between W&L
and Bates College are due on
March 15, according to Dean
Pamela Simpson.

Bates is a small co-ed institu-
tion in Lewiston, Maine, about
140 miles northeast of Boston. It
enrolls approximately 720 men
and 706 women and has the
distinction of being the first co-
ed college in New England,
founded just after the War be-
tween the States.

Wonder of wonders — Dean
Simpson says that Bates runs
on a calendar identical to
Washington and Lee’s. This is
truly phenomenal in its own
right, but will also be most con-
venient for those who want to
attend for just one term.

Unlike other exchange ar-
rangements, in which students
pay tuition to their own school,
W&L students going to Bates
will have to pay that school’s
rate and vice-versa. Tuition at
Bates runs slightly higher than
at W&L, according to Simpson.

 

Bates Applications Due

Criteria for the exchange pro-
gram was passed by the Com-
mittee on Courses and Degrees
and goes something like this:

The program is offered to
sophomores and juniors for one
semester, one semester plus
shortened spring term or for the
entire year. It will be limited to
five students with no exchange
on a one-to-one basis. Decision
must be made by March 15 for
the fall and October 15 for the
spring term.

Students must be ‘‘in good
standing,”’ receive an endorse-
ment from the dean of the host
institution and “approval of
other agencies such as off-
campus study committees as
deemed appropriate by the
home institution.”

Those interested in more
details should flock to the office
of Dean Simpson, who says
Bates provides an opportunity
to take different courses in a co-
ed environment in another loca-
tion.

reminded that the building has
a few regulations against the

by Scott Mason

Lexington City Mayor
Charles Phillips said he does
not plan to investigate a matter
concerning alleged selective en-
forcement by the Lexington
Police Department in the form
of noise violations and permits
to amplify music.

In regard to a story that ap-
peared in the Feb. 11 issue of
the Ring-tum Phi which cited
several specific documented in-
cidents of selective enforce-
ment, Mayor Phillips said that

  

carrying glass beverage con-
tainers, metal beverage con-
tainers or other types of coolers
will be permitted into Cameron
Hall.

Cameron Hall officials also
remind students that seizures
are possible, but only will be
conducted with the consent of
the patron. All people caught by
police or security officials will
be prohibited from attending
the concert and will be turned
over either to V.M.I.’s security
force or the nearest Virginia

until he receives a complaint in-
volving the matter, he has no in-
tention of looking into the
allegations.

Phillips said that, despite
evidence gathered from police
records and eyewitness
testimony, he has no proof nor
knews who is involved or who is
accused.

Phillips feels he is _ not
justified in acting solely on the
basis of a news story and will
not consider the matter until a

Any patron found to be carry-
ing controlled substances while
attempting to enter the concert
will be given the option to leave
the material outside the concert
hall. If the patron wishes not to
do this, he will be given the op-
tion of having his ticket refund-
ed.

Tonight’s concert begins at
7:30 p.m. Students are advised

by Todd Jones
Taps is a movie with many messages. It is ob-
vious that Director, Co-Screenplay Author Harold
Becker had something to say about guns, guts,
honor, truth, kids, adults, and the military. All of
these issues are brought up during the length of
the movie Taps.

The plot of the movie is that a military academy
is Scheduled to be closed. The seniors at the high
school will be allowed to finish their year during a
short session. However, during a rumble with
some of the townies, the headmaster’s gun is ac-
cidentally fired. A townie dies, and the head-
master has a heart attack. The Board of Trustees
announces that the school will be closed im-
mediately. The head student decides otherwise,
and orders all the students to instigate a military
take-over. They defend the school with guns and
grenades against state troopers, parents, and
even the national guard.

Within this plot there are different issues. The
headmaster, played by George C. Scott, proclaims
that honor is the single most important facet of
life. Later, the head student, played by Timothy
Hutton, says ‘Honor doesn’t mean anything when
there is a twelve-year-old boy lying dead at your
feet.”” The movie constantly questions the role of a
solider, or even what a soldier is.

Scott mentions that all military leaders have
been depicted as crazy because ‘‘they all are a lit-
tle off balance; some a lot off balance.” There are
very few statements that don’t have another

.f r,t t

The Ring-tum Phi; March 4, 1982, Page 3

 

Timothy Hutton Plays “Taps’

character offset their statements.

George C. Scott plays his role commandingly.
Unfortunately, he is really in no more than the
first twenty minutes. His performance is good, but
there is just enough of him.

Timothy Hutton does a pretty-good job. He is
especially good in two scenes. One, a confronta-
tion with his father, and the other, when he
realizes that the national guard is about to invade
the school.

Ronny Cox plays the leader of the national
guard. He confronts all of Hutton’s hypotheses
with cynicism and realism. His performance is
good as well.

The outstanding performance comes from Sean
Penn. He plays Hutton’s roommate, and is simply
tremendous. He is not excited about the military
take-over, but justifies his remaining at the school
by telling Hutton, “I don’t walk out on a friend.”
He also comes up with the idea that Hutton should
just proclaim victory, and then put down his arms
and walk out.

The most important thing about seeing this
movie is that you must be forced to leave all reali-
ty aside. Every five minutes there is another
episode which is impossible to believe. This is a
real failing, for a movie which strives to bring
statements against things all-too-real must be
done in an unbelievable fashion.

Except for this problem in believeability, Taps
is a good film.

Cagers Snubbed By NCAA...

by G. Bruce Potter

Perhaps Dean Atwood should
coach the Washington and Lee
basketball team. Or even Pro-
fessor Handelman.

What do these two dis-
tinguished faculty members
have to do with W&L basket-
ball? Just ask head coach Verne
Canfield, whose Generals clos-
ed out their season with a 72-54
loss to Roanoke in the finals of
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference tournament that drop-
ped their record to 21-7. They
lost a second battle later in the
day when the NCAA selection
committee overlooked them as
an at-large entry for the Divi-
sion III tournament.

“I was disappointed because
the boys deserved it without a
doubt,”’ said Canfield, who
notched his fourth 20-win season
en route to claiming the ODAC’s
Coach-of-the-Year award. “It
was just a matter of politics and
economics.”

The Generals, who had a bet-
ter record than 18 of the schools
in the 32-team NCAA field,
crushed Eastern Mennonite
92-60 and Hampden-Sydney
70-59 to advance to Sunday’s
ODAC final at the Salem-
Roanoke County Civic Center.
Despite a poor shooting perfor-
mance by W&L, ranked 17th in
the latest Division III poll,
Roanoke, ranked third, only
led by three, 30-27, at halftime.

A basket by John Lee Graves,
who had nine points, gave W&L
a 35-34 lead with 15 minutes left

in the game. Moreover, over the
next six minutes, the Maroons
outscored the Generals 9-2 to
take a 45-37 advantage.

Frank Eppes, who led all
scorers with 20 points, con-
nected to cut the Roanoke lead
to six points, and W&L took
what may have been a fatal
timeout because it was at this
point that the Maroons decided
to go into their spread offense
that presented numerous pro-
blems for the Generals.

“It’s a question of quickness
and psychology,’’ said Canfield.
“It’s an awkward situation for
the defense because they are
forced to foul and hope they
miss the free throws.”’

The last thing the Maroons
did was to miss their free
throws as they hit 18 of 20 over
the last ten minutes, and most
of their baskets during that
span came on backdoor plays as
W&L was unable to match up
man-for-man. Meanwhile, the
Generals’ offensive woes con-
tinued as Roanoke rattled off
eight straight points to take a
55-41 lead at the 5:43 mark.

Other than Eppes, no
Generals scored in double
figures as they shot 37.7 percent
from the floor, a mark that in-
cluded sophomore guard Billy
Yates, normally a sixty-percent
shooter, 1-10 performance. ‘““We
just did not click on offense. In
certain situations, we tried to
create when we should have
taken more time. We had
wanted to set the tempo

because we knew we couldn’t
_run with them,” said Canfield.

Another problem that
plagued the team was turnovers
— 19 against’ Roanoke and 20
versus Hampden-Sydney on
Saturday. Despite those
mistakes, the Generals had
very little problem in disposing
of the Tigers 70-59.

The Generals opened in a 2-3
zone defense against H-SC, but
Hampden-Sydney’s Mark Kelly
scored 12 points, all from the
outside, over the first ten
minutes of the game to give his
team an 18-10 lead. But Canfield
remained confident in his
defense. ‘‘Long, outside shots
will never beat you,’’ he said.
“You must maintain poise on
the offensive end. When they
stop hitting, they will still keep
shooting, so you just need to
concentrate on boxing out.’’

... Finish Second In ODAC

by John M. Cleghorn

The first thing the Generals
had to do after the final game of
the ODAC championship Sun-
day afternoon was listen to the
announcement of the all-tourna-
ment team. Three of the five
spots chosen from the eight
team tournament went to
Roanoke players and that tells
the story for the championship
game, the tournament, and the
season in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference.

The tournament went just
about as everyone expected,
with W&L meeting Roanoke in
the final game. The Generals
beat Eastern Mennonite and
Hampden-Sydney with relative
ease, setting the stage for the
third showdown between the
first and second-seeded teams
in the conference.

In many ways the tournament
games for the Generals were a
capsule of their season. After
beating Eastern Mennonite
twice in the regular season the
opening round on Thursday
night turned out to be an exhibi-
tion for the Generals. A 15-point
lead through most of the second

half gave some of ine players a
chance to show their abilities
outside the normal rigid of-
fense. The ear-to-ear grin on
Bill Yates’ face as he sat on the

bench and watched freshmen -

and reserves play out the clock
expressed the anticipation. of
the second round.

The Salem-Roanoke Civic
Center is built to hold 3500 peo-

ple. In the first round of the
semi-finals only 178 fans show-
ed up to watch the game be-
tween W&L and Hampden-
Sydney which showed another
aspect of the Generals’ play.

For the first 13 minutes W&L
sputtered, not playing the
smooth control game that
brought them many of its
regular season wins. But a
large part of their success is the
fact that they are smart ball
players and are adapt. Towards
the end of the first half and
throughout the second the
Generals settled down and took
the reins. Except for a last
minute flurry in which the
Tigers pulled within five, the
victory was clearly W&L’s.

the third W&L Roanoke game. —

Roanoke had slammed-dunked
its way there and W&L had
finessed its way there. “

From their first possession
the Generals played their slow
deliberate offense. The
Maroons came out running but
the play later slowed to a
smarter zone game. The half-
time score had Roanoke up by
one,

Four minutes into the second
half, the factors the Generals
couldn’t do anything about,
Roanoke’s superior size and
depth, came into play. A one
point lead went to three, to
eight, and to 10. There were no
Unknown Fans or Warner
Center crowds to intervene and
the Generals went down
fighting.

To win 21 games, tie for the
conference title, and lose to a
team ranked third in the coun-
try in the tournament finals is a
pretty good year. To do so ina
transition year is something
else. And the best part is that
we only lose two seniors.

Is that enough to call next
year a tran.‘tion year? ,

Wood’s Four Goals Lead Generals Over Duke

by Doug Teague

Geoff Wood scored four goals
as the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team downed Duke
12-6 in a season-opening victory
Tuesday in Durham, NC.

The host Blue Devils opened
the scoring about two minutes
into the game, but W&L re-
bounded with goals by tri-
captain Rob Staugaitis and
Wood. The first period ended at
2-2, but the Generals scored
three unanswered goals in the
second stanza and opened up
the third with five consecutive
scores. Washington and Lee’s
scoring closed in the fourth
quarted with a goal by Joe
Seifert.

John Sancilio tallied three
goals for the squad and
Staugaitis lead the team in

assists with four in addition to
his first quarter goal. The
Generals had a total of 41 shots
on goal.

Ware Palmer started in thé
goal and had nine saves. Mark
Lukes, a sophomore, was in the
net for most of the second half
and made seven stops.

Head Coach Jack Emmer

was pleased with the offensive
performance of the attack. The
midfield was solid also as San-
cilio won the ‘Cannon Awerd”’
for the outstanding player of the
game. Emmer expressed en-

thusiasm over Rich Schoen-
berg’s performance on face-

‘offs. Going against a very good

face-off man, the freshman won

has switched from attack this
year, had a good day in his new
role. Assistant Coach Eric
Kemp said that the defensemen
were working well together and
will continue to improve in the
concept of team defense.

Emmer and the squad had
been concerned going into Tues-
day’s game becuase they hadn’t
practiced for three days prior to
the contest due to bad weather.

In addition, a practice session
held before the game was slop-
py. Emmer realized that there
were some areas that needed to
be worked on. “We had a steady
performance but spotty execu-

The weather was not kind to
the fencing team this season.
Although the club had originally

been scheduled to fence eight
teams in addition to the six
teams fencing in the Virginia
Cup, five of these meets were
cancelled due to poor driving
conditions.

When the team did fence, it
fenced well—considering _ its
club status. The team beat the
Citadel’s varsity squad, but lost
to Navy and VMI. The 14-13 loss
to VMI was the toughest loss for
the team. According to team
coach Tad Humphreys, “W&L
should have beaten us.”

Individually W&L had some
outstanding fencers. Pat Berg
finished fourth in the state com-
petition, and Freshman Tom
Stewert finished the season with
a 7-2 record. According to cap-
tian Dave Hepler, ‘‘Tom has the
potential to be a really good
fencer. Finishing 7-2 in your
fisrt season is excellent.’’

As usual, graduaution will
take its toll on the team. Among
the missing next year will be
former state champion and cur-
rent captian Hepler, and the
team’s number two. sabre
fencer Clyde Harkrader.

Jack Emmer, Lacrosse Coach

Canfield, Four Generals

Honored In ODAC

Washington and Lee heaa
basketball coach Verne Can-
field and standout performers
Brian Hanson and George
Spears received honors during
the week of February 22 from
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference.

Canfield, who completed his
18th-year as Generals’ director,
was named the league’s Coach-
of-the-Year. He guided W&L to
a 21-7 record, a runner-up finish
in the 0.D.A.C. Championship
Tournament, and to a 17th spot
in the NCAA Division III na-
tional rankings for the week of
February 25. The award is his
second in the league’s six-year
history, the first coming in 1977
when he led W&L to a 23-5
record and the first of three
O.D.A.C. titles. His overall
W&L record stands at 293-167, a
winning mark of 63.6 percent,
and includes four twenty-win
seasons.

Hanson, a junior forward
from Rockville, Md., received
first-team All-Conference
recognition. A starter in all 28
games this winter, he compiled
a 13.0 scoring average and a 7.2
rebounding average, connec-
ting on 50.5 percent of his field
goals and on 81.6 percent of his
free throws. He led the team in
scoring on ten occasions and in
rebounding 11 times.

Spears, a senior guard from
Annandale, Va., was selected to
the All-Conference second
team. A starter in 27 games this
season, he finished with an 11.2 .
scoring average and 82 assists.
He was successful on 51.2 per-
cent of his field goals, and 84.3
percent of his free throws.

W&L players also earned two
of the eight honorable-mention
All-Conference awards: junior
center Frank Eppes (Green-
ville, S.C.) and sophomore for-
ward John Lee Graves
(Virginia Beach, Va.).

and Ben Jarratt
_ Presidential candidates Jim
Averett and Bennett Ross
squared off Wednesday after-
noon about the role of debate
and the student body funding of
spiritual groups, but the discus-
sion centered on qualifications
at the candidateforum. .

Peter Collins, the third can-
didate for the student body
president position, did not at-
tend the forum because of class.

Asked to evaluate his perfor-
mance on the Executive Com-
mittee as Vice President,
Averett responded that. it had
been a learning year for him.
He also pointed to his ex-
perience on a number of other
bodies.

“T remember on the Student
Control Committee, (as presi-
dent) I was the one who did all
the work and preparation,” said
Averett..

a working knowledge of the
honor system.”

E.C. Secretary Bennett Ross
answered that, “I think I was
able to pull myself away from
the minutes and say some-
thing.” ;

“The secretary is not some-

one elected just to write. He’s a
voice on this committee...and
that’s how he should spend his
time, and still be responsible for
putting out reliable and respon-
sible lists of what goes on in
these meetings.”
- Ross also noted his respon-
sibility to serve on subcom-
mittees, and said that he had
worked on the Centel Telephone
Co-op subcommittee and a com-
mittee that examined ways to
comply with the student body
vote on constitutional ammend-
‘ments.

Averett said that meetings
were running “‘way too long,”
and that the meeting he chaired
last week in the absense of
President Eric Myers was ‘‘one
of the smoother meetings we
had all year.”

the comment Jim made that the
discussion was sometimes
cyclical. We’re not a debating
society, that’s true, but the
discussion that we have allows
us to hash out issues as far as
twelve different members’ per-
spectives on one issue...coming
to a similar way of looking at
something.”’

In explaining his qualifica-
tions, Averett mentioned that
he had worked with President
Huntley and students, like Bill
Archer, to secure university

‘money for the. Inter-Varsity
Christian Fellowship after the
group’s budget reqest was re-
jected by the E.C. :

The Honor System

Citing a possible problem in
the student-run, single-sanction
honor system, Averett noted,
“It is called (an honor) hearing,

‘but in some ways, it’s not a
hearing. It’s more of a trial, and
I think ways need to be looked
into to see how it can be improv-
ed.”’

“T think our procedures, most
of all the single sanction, are
our most viable working parts
of the honorsystem. I’ve talked

ce
ser
eee
yea

for President at

to Sam Allen extensively, who is
one of the students who has
worked a great deal with the
Executive Committee, and I’ve
seen some problems that could
arise in the future,” said
Averett.

Despite questions from Ben

Hale (’84 Rep.) and Myers,.

Averett said it would be “‘an in-
justice’”’ to make proposals
“from the hip.” He recom-
mended more study.

Ross agreed that the single
sanction was the ‘most impor-
tant characteristic of our honor
system.”’ He praised White
Book revisions made last spring
and said that everything had
run smoothly this year because
of those changes.

Ross recommended that
questionaires be filled out by
students participating in honor
hearings so that the E.C. could
learn from each trial. Other
than establishing this program
of ‘following up,” Ross had no
major changes in mind for the
Honor System.

“I cannot fathom someone
coming in to chair an honor
hearing, never having seen an

honor hearing,”’ said Ross, in
reference seemingly to Peter
Collins, who contends for the
job of president without having
served as an E.C. represen-
tative. .

“It’s an extremely difficult
system,” said Ross.

Separation of Powers.

Leonard Howard asked the
two presidential candidates to
comment on .the possibility of
dividing the legislative part of
student government from the
judicial side.

“You’ve got to integrate the
honor system with other goings-
on around campus,” said
Averett. ‘In that way I feel you
should not separate the
legislative from the judicial
aspects.’

“I think that a school or our
size doesn’t require two dif-
ferent, distinct student body
governments,” said Ross. “I
can forsee problems insofar as
the role of a separate honor
body. Their whole role would be
enshrouded in secrecy.”’

Ross said that the the publici-
ty of the legislative side enhanc-
ed accountability on the secret,

Myers Questions Averett

Myers asked Averett at the
end of the forum why he had
missed over a third of the
meetings of the Faculty Ex-
ecutive Committee. Myers
noted that Averett was given
the position of ad hoc member
of Dean Eward Atwood’s
powerful committee because of
his office of Vice President.

“Thank you very much for
asking that, Eric,” replied
Averett. “They didn’t schedule
the meetings around my
classes.” -

Averett said that he was in
class at those times when he
was absent.

Myers then said that other
committees have made special

arrangements for the E.C., |

such as the University Council,
which has rescheduled some
meetings to fit Myers’ schedule.

‘T’m sorry, but that’s not
what they did with me,” said
_*verett. Averett later smiled
and called it a “‘hose-question.”

Platforms

Averett rests his campaign on

his experience as head of the

Student Control Committee and
on his contacts with alumni, ad-
ministrators and law students.

“All these committees have
given me a good, a better-than-
average view of issues on cam-
pus. I think that is a very impor-
tant aspect when you assume
the presidency where you are
dealing with faculty ad-
ministrators, deans, board
members — and you are work-
ing with these people on a day-
to-day basis.”’

Ross stresses his record of ef-
ficient note-taking and his con-
tributions to debate.

“I think the only real ex-
perience which is probably ap-
plicable to the job of president
is the actual experience on the
Executive Committee. I think
being secretary this year, you
are more keenly attuned to
some of the smaller details of
what the committee does as far
as the preparations for honor
hearings.

“T’ve been able to work close-
ly this year with Eric in that
capacity and developed a sense
of what the job is basically
about,”’ said Ross.

by Todd Smith
and Ben Jarratt
Although Mike Singer is the
only candidate for Secretary of
the E.C. on the ballot for Mon-
day, he had to tangle with Pete
Baumgaertner yesterday in a
candidates’ forum yesterday.

Baumgaertner is running a
write-in campaign based on his
experience as a sophomore E.C.
representative. Singer’s ex-
perience with government
comes from serving as head of
this year’s Voting Regulations
Board.

Asked to describe his creden-
tials, Singer said, “‘When you
mention the job of secretary of
the E.C., you have to think of
hard work and dedication cause
that’s what the job is all about.’’
Singer noted that he had sat in

Informal Collins for

by Todd Smith

Peter Collins missed the
Forum Wednesday afternoon
because of class, but the per-
sonal interview of him that the
Phi conducted afterwards was
more in keeping with his style
anyway.

“I want to keep this infor-
mal,” Collins said.

Indeed, Collins was at pains
to come across as “relaxed, but
definitely concerned. I will
listen to everything the students
have to say. OBJECTIVITY,
that’s the word.”

Collins has no E.C. ex-
perience but has served on Stu-
dent Control. He is graduating
next year after only three years
at Washington and Lee.

“TI think there’s too much of a
mystique about the job of
presidency. I think the _presi-
dent has to be someone that the
people can associate with, and I
think its the purpose of the
president to bring the E.C.

The Ring-tum Phi, March 4, 1982, Page 7

 

on student control hearings as
vice president of his class, and
that he has served on the
univeristy Council.

Explaining his work with the
VRB, Singer said, “Three am-
mendments passed and there
were enough people that voted
this year, whereas that has
always been a problem in the
past, and I think that says
something about dedication,
because I worked very hard on
that.”

Baumgaertner said that he
served as liason member to the
VRB when he was on the E.C.
“With the VRB, we made up a
set of proposals and recommen-
dations to the E.C. last spring,
and many of those proposals
came to fruition....’’

He noted that his work with
the Mock Convention subcom-
mittee led to putting funds in

down to the students level.”’

Collins said that he was con-
cerned about a feeling he saw
among students that the E.C.
was a collection of “stuffed
shirts.”’

“It just takes preparation,
and it takes the confidence and
support of the rest of the
members,’’ said Collins.

Collins said that he had talked
to past presidents of the E.C.
and he believed that he could be
prepared for the job with mock
honor hearings and tutoring.

Asked the same questions
about the honor system as those
candidates at the forum, Collins
agreed that the single sanction
is essential to the honor system.

About the possibility of ad-
ding two extra members, and
idea which Ross and Averett
feel was properly handled when
rejected by the E.C. earlier,
Collins said, ‘‘I would like to see
the present elections process
explore. There is the possibility
of choosing both the law school

Baumgaertner, Singer forSec’y

money market accounts. “‘I feel
I have the organizational abili-
ty, which is pretty much in-
herent in my academic stan-
ding and in my other commit-
tees which I have worked on,
Specifically the Who’s Who
committee....”’ ;

Baumgaertner also spoke of
his ‘good rapport with the
faculty.”’ _

When asked about improving
the honor system, Baumgaert-
ner noted that he had long
fought for the revising of a
sentence which he felt scared
away good, honest students.

Singer said that student
awareness of the honor system
was very low, so low that
students voted to retain the
position of treasurer on the E.C.
when there has been none for
years. .

Prez

representatives at large so that
they would both be on the E.C.
when the year began.”

“I'd like to look into the
possibility of a freshman trip to
Natural Bridge again. We need
some type of experience where
the freshman becomes _ ac-
quainted with the honor system.
I think its unfair to ask the
freshmen to ‘live and learn’’’

Collins proposes to strengthen
the guidance counseling system
here, modeling the career
placement of lawyers on the
way the chemistry department
places future doctors, with
availible information about
graduate studies and jobs
available all four years.

Collins proposes to improve
the ‘‘town-gown’’ relationship.
He would like to see noise viola-
tions reduced as well as any
animosity, he said.

“T just want everybody to be
happy, for everyone to get
along,” said Collins.

In College Survey, W&L Rated Average

Students at Washington and
Lee often take pride in pointing
out the difficulties of the school.
The rigors of a liberal arts
education, they say, make this
one of the more demanding
schools in the South, if not inthe
nation.

A study conducted by the New
York Times disputes this state-
ment, however. In a survey of
265 of the leading colleges in the
nation, The Times concludes in
its ‘‘Selective Guide to Colleges,
1982-83,” that Washington and
Lee is only average, nationally,
in terms of academics, social
life and quality of living.
Schools were graded on a
numerical scale with an ideal
score of five for each category.

In making the guide, Edward
B. Fiske, Education Editor of
the New York Times, and a
staff of over 250 researchers
collected information from col-
lege administrators, admis-
sions officers and leaders of col-
lege student bodies. In choosing
only 265 of the more than 2000
four-year colleges in the United
States, the Times looked for
schools that had ‘‘special
popularity at the present.”’

The question that most ob-
viously comes to mind is where
does W&L rank with the rest of
the country? If we are to guess
that all colleges that receive the
same ‘‘triple three” ratings as
W&L fall in the same category,
then here are a few of what the
Times feels are our equals.
Keep in mind that these are all

schools that scored ‘“‘triple
three’ ratings.

How The Girls’ Schools Fared

HOLLINS COLLEGE

How does this small all-
women’s college in the wilds of
the Blue Ridge Mountains keep
its student body so contented?
Hollins women can expect all
the attention and respect they
want from an administration
that is ‘‘definitely committed to
the education of its students.”
There is enough academic em-
phasis to keep ‘determined,
ambitious women’’ busy, but lit-
tle enough pressure so that
“when a party comes up,
homework is forgotten.”’

The school’s academic pro-
gram is typical of a small
liberal-arts college. The best
departments are English, par-
ticularly creative writing, and
psychology, each with a na-

RANDOLPH-MACON
WOMAN’S COLLEGE
Whatever you do, do not say,
suggest, or imply to a
Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege student that her school is a
finishing school. The members
of this close-knit college com-
munity are extremely proud of
their academic tradition and
are tired of battling the
finishing-school misnomer that
persistently raises its ugly
head. “‘R-MWC’s every bit as
good as Smith or Wellesley,”
asserts one student, ‘‘and I’d
like to see it get some credit.”
She is, of course, overstating
the situation considerably, but
the defensiveness is understan-
dable. Randolph-Macon was the
first Southern women’s college

SWEET BRIAR COLLEGE

You just can’t rely on
anything anymore — not even
on Sweet Briar College, that
elegent finishing school where
young Scarlett O’Haras once
perfected their antebellum-
style charm. The stereotype of
“white gloves and snobby
Southern girls” is crumbling as
surely as the walls of Jericho
amidst the college’s new
slogan: ‘‘An education for reali-
ty.” As one biology major
demands, ‘‘How can people in
their right minds believe that
Sweet Briar is a Southern
finishing school in this day and
age? Get REAL!”

Unlike other revitalized
women’s schools, Sweet Briar is
not gung ho about professional

W&L: Surrendering To The

WASHINGTON AND LEE °

This institution, founded in
the mid-eighteenth century, has
finally followed the example of
its mid-nineteenth-century
president, Robert E. Lee, and
surrendered — not to the Union,
but to the twentieth century. No
longer a finishing school for
sons of the Southern
aristocracy, W&L imports
almost half its student body
from up North. A standard
liberal-arts program remains
the foundation of the cur-
riculum, but there are also ex-
cellent preprofessional pro-
grams that send large numbers
of graduates to top medical,
law, and business schools.
Although certain traditional
aspects of the school, like the
stately brick and white-column
buildings, still preserve the at-
mosphere of the Old South, the

only real throwback to the days
of Lee is the all-male student
body. '
Washington and Lee has
maintained its outstanding
departments in history and
English, and added _inter-
disciplinary Russian and East
Asian studies, the latter
enhanced by new ties with the
National University of Taiwan.
The school’s growing preprofes-
sional emphasis is reflected in
its popular School of Com-
merce, Economics, and
Politics, the journalism major,
and science departments,
although math and physics are
considered weak. The excellent
placement record for its
graduates testifies to the quali-
ty instruction in these areas.
Complementing this vocational
emphasis is an_ inter-
disciplinary program in Socie-

ty, Ethics, and the Professions.
The distribution require-
ments in liberal arts have
recently been toned down and
are no longer considered ‘‘undu-
ly rigorous.”’ Anyone aiming for
more than the gentleman’s C,
though, will find the workload
stiff. ‘“Guts are simply not to be
found,’’ warns one senior. “If
any course garners that reputa-
tion, the department im-
mediately remedies the situa-
tion.’’ Only three courses can be
taken pass-fail during a stu-
dent’s four years. Despite stiff
grading, the rapport between
students and teachers is ex-
cellent. It is not unusual for a
professor to have a group of
students over for dinner and
“even the lowliest freshmen’”’
have access to _ faculty
members. This level of respect
and friendliness is a result not

Twentieth

only of the school’s small size,
but also of the student-
administered honor system
— “a smash hit” at W&L. Test
and final exams are taken
without any faculty supervi-
sion; doors remain unlocked,
calculators untended, and
library stacks open twenty-four
hours a day. The only punish-
ment for violation, one meted
out several times a year, is im-
mediate expulsion.

The school has diversified its
curriculum by offering more in-
ternships, studies abroad, and
close-to-home study through the
Seven-College Exchange. The
school ends the year with a six-
week term offering student-
organized seminars, indepen-
dent study, and department
trips abroad. The new library’s
facilities are superb, boasting
800 individual study areas as

Mass; Miami {Fla.j; Michigan
State; Michigan; Middlebury; New

Hampshire; N.¥.U.; U.N.C.-
Chapel Hill; Notre Dame;

In the immediate area, the
University of Virginia was the
big winner. U.Va. was given the
highest possible ratings for both

.academic standards and quali-
ty of living. Ironically, U.Va., a
school notorious for partying,
did not receive a perfect score
for social life.

Two North Carolina schools,
Duke and North Carolina, also
received high marks. U.N.C.
received a perfect score for
academics and near-perfect
marks for quality of living and
social life. Duke scored “‘fours”’
in all three categories.

Overall, Virginia and North
Carolina received higher marks
than Harvard, which received a
“five” for academics, but only

three for social life and four for ‘

quality of living.

If W&L was disappointed by
‘its scores, then the local girls’
schools had to be somewhat
satisfied. Randolph-Macon and
Sweet Briar were given
“threes” for academics while
Hollins was saddled with a two.
The girls’ schools made a com-
eback in quality of living, with
Sweet Briar and Hollins getting
better ratings than W&L. Both
Macon and Sweet Briar rated
below W&L in social life.

well as private rooms for
honors students.

Conservatis.., is as much a
part of the twentieth century as
of the nineteenth and the stu-
dent body at Washington and
Lee is no exception. One student
writes bluntly that ‘people who
do not like Southern preppies
and fairly rich, elitist people”
should not come to W&L.
Minorities are in for a par-
ticularly rough time, and only
recently, says the admissions
director, have they been enroll-
ed “in significant numbers.”
Blacks now number less than 2
percent of the student body. The
school’s new-found geographic
diversity has not prompted
much other differentiation, and
pink button-downs, khakis, and
penny loafers remain the cam-
pus uniform. Public-school

What The New York Times Had To Say About W&L

W&L:

: (continued from page 8)
graduates (about 55 percent of
the students) soon succumb to
the pressure to conform and
“‘turn preppie.’’ Never prone to
false modesty, the W&L man
considers himself ‘‘better-
looking, more intelligent, more
outgoing, and more self-
confident than the average
male.”

Students spend their first
year living comfortably in dor-
mitory singles and eating well
in Evans Dining Hall. The good
food is ‘another plus for
neurotic mommies,’”’ says one
student, who confesses to hav-
ing put on twenty pounds. After
freshman year, most students
bypass the small upperclass
dorm and move either to frater-
nities or off campus. The in-
town apartments, or farm-
houses in the country, are large,
inexpensive, and a nice escape
from campus life. Bumping
against the foothills of the
beautiful Blue Ridge moun-
tains, the school provides an
abundance of activities for
nature lovers, including hun-
ting, fishing, camping, and tub-
ing in the rivers. Washington,
Richmond, and ski slopes are
easily reached by car for
weekend trips. On campus, a
thriving intramural program

 

brings fraternities and in--

dependents together in friendly
rivalry. Football sparks some
interest in the fall, but W&L
students “live for the spring
and lacrosse.” Continual con-
tenders for national champion-
ships, the team holds the cam-

pus in thrall from March to
June.

Ringed by five women’s col-
leges within an hour’s drive,
there is enough weekend
socializing at W&L to make up
for the long hours in the library.
Social life focuses on several
big weekends a term including
an outrageously expensive Fan- —
cy Dress Weekend that lures
women from all over the wires
east and Southeast. But special
events or no, hundreds of -
women make the trip to W&L
every week for fraternity par-
ties, school-run mixers, and the
“Cockpit,” the school’s pub.

The school’s seventeen frater-
nities are still the movers and
shakers of the W&L social
scene, each hosting parties
almost every weekend. About
two-thirds of the students go
Greek and those who don’t are
urged to share the social life by
“at least hanging out at one.”
Despite Virginia’s minimum
drinking age of 21 for every-
thing except beer, liquor and
grain punch are staples of the
W&L diet. “Many of the
students have been weaned on
Bloody Marys at their local
country club,’’ observes one
student; few break the habit
here.

Despite the number of eager
and eligible young women

descending on Lexington each

weekend, students continually
cite the all-male environment
as the school’s biggest
drawback. “Single-sex, ugh,’
declares one student. Maybe
the time has come for

Washington and Lee to sur- |

render again.

training, career internships,
and the like. Rather it remains
committed to a quality liberal-
arts education that makes far
more than token demands on its
young women. ‘“‘It’s hard to fail

well,” is how one student
describes it. The new distribu-
tion requirements, while not
always appreciated, assure ex-
posure to a foreign language,
English, phys ed, math, a lab

tionally known faculty member
and the school’s only graduate

programs. Students also recom-

mend French, history, philos-
ophy, and art. Like many other
schools, Hollins has introduced
the popular January term for
travel, internships, or special
on-campus academic projects.
The library is not terribly good,
but those at nearby Virginia
Polytechnic Institute or
Roanoke College can always: be
used. Although stressing a
liberal-arts curriculum, Hollins
has made some concessions to
the career-oriented, including
new programs in computer
science and statistics and a
greater emphasis on business in
the economics department. It
also offers combined-degree
programs in engineering, ar-
chitecture, and nursing at
Virginia Tech or the University
of Virginia. More imaginative
students may design their own
course of study.

Academic pressure is kept to
a minimum, even during ex-
amination week, and the
student-administered Indepen-
dent Exam System allows each
student to take tests at her con-
venience and without supervi-
sion. Nevertheless, most seem

 

to take their studies seriously,
and partying during the week is
not common.

Many students take a visiting
semester at another college.
Programs include studying in-
ternational relations at Drew
University in New Jersey and
political science at American
University in Washington.
Others take advantage of the
Seven-College Exchange or
Hollins’ programs in Paris and
London, both featuring living
with families there.

Though the 1980s breed of
Hollins. student may be more
“mellow and relaxed,’ the
typical student is still what she
has always been: white, upper-
middle-class, and Southern
preppie. More than half of them
graduate from private schools.
The school has a national stu-
dent body — only a quarter
comes from Virginia. Almost
half the students ranked in the
bottom three-fifths of their high
school classes, but everyone is
quick to discount any finishing-
school taint. Administrators
point out that manv students
come from highly competitive
private schools As applications
increase, admissions criteria
are rising, and, says one stu-
dent, “Hollins has no qualms
about asking students to
withdraw for grades.”’

The school takes full advan-
tage of the beautiful Shenan-
doah Valley and Blue Ridge

Mountains by organizing hikes,

canoe and raft trips, bike hikes,
spelunking, and rock climbing.
At the annual Tinker Day
festivities, sometime after the
first frost of autumn, classes
are canceled in the morning and
the whole school hikes to the top
of Tinker Mountain for picnics,
songs, and skits. There is also a
forty-horse stable on campus
and an extensive riding pro-
gram. There are no _ in-
tramurals, and the tiny gym

and pool are desperately in_

need of the planned addition.

itself shuns sororities but does
organize school-wide mixers.
Road trips are made each
weekend, but about half the stu-
dent body stays on campus to
make their own fun. For male
friends visiting Hollirts,*there is
a ‘men’s dorm” in which the
guest may room for a small fee.

Hollins is a college where
everyone “radiates with
friendliness.’’ “Hollie Collies’’
face little pressure either to

ly, but the opportunities for both

its ability to educate each stu-
dent “‘in the singular.” Pro-
fessors take a personal interest
in their students, as do the
president and other top ad-
ministrators.

This community feeling and
mutual trust allow students a
great deal of autonomy. Instead
of enforcing formal distribution
requirements, the college relies
on optional guidelines and the
tailoring of individual pro-
grams by a faculty adviser.
When it comes time to declare a
major, a student can choose
either traditional departments
or interdisciplinary majors
such as communication, inter-
national relations, or Asian
Studies or, if none of these are to
her liking, design her own.
Students work under an all-
encompassing, student-
regulated honor system that in-
cludes self-scheduled exams.
They may also take advantage
of Randolph-Macon’s participa-
tion in the Seven-College Ex-
change to experience another
campus for a year or semester.
The college also offers a junior
year abroad at the University of
Reading in England and a joint
engineering program with
Vanderbilt. Students can easily
arrange for special internships,
independent study, or study
abroad through another school.

SBC’s traditions — lantern
bearing, step singing, and the
fight for the senior stairs seem
to be especially prized — and
appreciate the genteel image
that clings to Sweet Briar and
its graduates. “Talk with an
alum,” one senior advises.
“She'll probably be polite and
well-groomed, and_ she’ll
definitely be intelligent.” In
short, Sweet Briar has found a
way to pursue the goals of the
eighties without shedding the
trappings of a finishing-school
education. ‘Yes, the campus
does look like a country club,’’
admits one student, “‘but who
said learning had to be unplea-
sant?”

disadvantages. The library’s
stocks are not always adequate
for intensive research projects,
and it closes at 11 p.m. Nor are
course offerings as abundant or
varied as at a larger school.
Most students, however, con-
sider these limitations a modest
price to pay for the highly
responsive and engaging
academic-setting.

Randolph-Macon women are
enrolled from more than forty
states and a dozen foreign coun-
tries, and the majority come
from public schools. Never-
theless, there are enough
Southern prep_ school
graduates, and they are visible
enough to give the college what
some call a ‘‘Southern-belleish”’
tone. The school, says one stu-
dent, is ‘‘a civilized academic
institution for women who ap-
preciate the finer qualities of
life,” in which she includes
afternoon teas. After all,
R-MWC stands for Respected
Mature Women with Class, or
so the saying goes.

Admission depends largely on
high school grades and class
rank. Doing well on your SATs
will not make up for an un-
satisfactory record because,
says the admissions director,
“high scores are not tickets of
admission if grades don’t
match.’’ Randolph-Macon
wants women who are “highly
academically motivated” and
ready to work; “whether you
come with motivation or it is in-
stilled here, you must really
study and push to keep up.”’

REVIEW aud OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

 

On Being Average

The New York Times’ Selective Guide to Colleges
leaves some interesting question’ about the status of
Washington and Lee University. In composing the
guide, the Times selected 265 schools out of the more

_ than 2,000 such four-year colleges in the nation. While
W&L was honored to be in this group, it received
marks that were not so impressive.

The Times’ write-up of W&L was very complimen-
tary. The article praised the school’s transition to pro-
fessional programs and said that W&L has fared well
in terms of job placement. However, the Times con-
cluded that W&L is only average — and that hurts.

Washington and Lee is not the cheapest college
around. After four years at W&L, the bills total
somewhere around $25,000. When this is considered, it
hurts to think that we’re attending only an average
college.

Surveys of W&L freshmen classes always indicate
that the W&L man considers himself better than the
average person. Perhaps this feeling of superiority,
coupled with the general elan created by excessive
minkism, is why the Times rating hurts.

Washington and Lee is certainly a cut above the or-
dinary. Unfortunately, the New York Times did not
reach the same conclusion. If the average W&L man
feels that he is superior, perhaps it is time to put that
sentiment to constructive use. We have convinced
each other that we are a good school. Perhaps it is
time to show the outside world that we really are bet-
ter than average.

Big Three Petitions Filed

by Ben Jarratt

Five students submitted peti-
tions to run for the Big Three
positions on the Executive Com-
mittee Monday night. The elec-
tion will be held Monday, March
8.

The race for the presidential
seat attracted three students.
The presidential candidates
are:

-Jim Averett, E.C. Vice
President and a junior politics
major from Atlanta, Ga. ;

--Peter Collins, president of
the sophomore class and a
Geology/English major from
Dallas, Tx.;

--Bennett Ross, E.C.
Secretary and a junior business
administration major from
Huntington, W.Va.

Morgan Griffith, second-year
law student from Salem, Va.,
will run unopposed for the vice
president position. Mike Singer,
a sophomore politics major
from Dallas, Tx., is running
unopposed for the secretary
seat. |

Warren Snead was nominated
as Voting Regulations Board
chairman to replace Singer,
who resigned as_ chairman
because of the elections. There
will be three polling booths on
the undergraduate campus
—one at the library, one at the
Co-op and one in the Freshman
Quad. Another booth will be at
the law school.

The E.C. set a $10 spending
limit for the candidates. One
banner and 15 posters will be
allowed on the university at one
time, with unlimited posters
allowed off-campus.

In other matters, E.C. Presi-
dent Eric Myers said the E.C.

should reflect the opinions of
the student body concerning the
selection of a new university
president. The E.C. debated
several ways of soliciting
responses from the student
body.
Ross motioned that the com-
mittee draw up a set of criteria
for use in selecting a new presi-
dent. Also, the E.C. would set up
suggestion boxes across cam-
pus to solicit student responses,
as well as contact Dean Watt
about the feasibility of a student
questionnaire on the subject.
The motion passed 10-1.
Averett opposed and Tripp
Brower, ’82 Rep., was absent.
Griffith brought up the issue
of having a student represen-
tative on the presidential selec-
tion committee. This would
allow for the students to be
heard in the selection process.
“The Board of Trustees has
already discussed and acted on
this matter,’’ replied Myers.
The board used a standard
selection format of faculty, ac
ministration and board
representatives. No students or
alumni were included.
“There is an entire aspect of

_ student life the trustees are

totally out of touch with,”
stated Tom Booher, First-year
Law Rep. ‘‘What is more impor-
tant to the students than the
selection of a new president?”’

John Vhaloplus, ’83 Rep.,
replied that the trustees had
already decided the issue.
“This is an arrogant and
useless thing to do.”’

“Our student government is
well-respected by the Board of
Trustees,’’ stated Ben Hale, ’84
Rep. ‘In order to maintain our

effectiveness on important
issues, we should let this issue
lay.”

Griffith proposed that the
E.C. write a letter to the board
suggesting a student represen-
tative be considered in any
future selection process. The
motion passed 6-5, with Myers,
Hale, Vlahoplus, Ted Mc-
Quiston, ’84 Rep., and Cole
Dawson, Freshman Rep., op-
posed.

Myers asked the committee
to respond to a recent Ring-tum
Phi critiq e of the E.C. He had
the impre. sion that ‘‘maybe the
E.C. wasn't doing enough.”’

‘“‘We can’t think of
everything,” responded Grif-
fith. “Students should be en-
couraged to attend E.C.
meetings.”

The idea of a ‘‘Gripe Session’”’
was also brought up. The E.C.
held one last year, but no
students showed up to voice
their complaints.

‘“‘We have one every Monday
night,” replied Hale. ‘One of
our main purposes is to be here.
We have to depend on our con-
stituents to come to us with
issues.”’

Ken Lang, ’82 Rep., motioned
that the E.C. take out an ad in
the Phi advertising ‘‘Gripe Ses-
sions’ every Monday night at
6:30. Lang suggested this may
generate some student interest
in regular E.C. meetings. The
motion passed 10-1, with
Averett opposing.

Myers announced the regular
E.C. elections will be held on
March 22. Petitions are due in
the E.C. office on March 15.
Elections in the law school will
be held March 29.

If They Could See Us Now

 

 

SSS i >~__ i S>>S|EES=S=S=S=S>pEpEIho ii ===

As money is spent in handfuls this week, som
bizarre thoughts come to mind.

We commence Fancy Dress not long after the
250th anniversary of George Washington’s birth
— an occasion given moderate attention national-
ly (his birthday was officially observed one week
earlier, to show you how dumb Congress is).

Washington, you know, gave Liberty Hall shares
of stock worth $50,000 in 1796, the last full year of
his presidency. That gift was enormous for those
times and was the largest ever given to a private
educational institution in the country. Were it not
for the gift the school probably wouldn’t be here,
soit was rightly named to honor George before the
nation’s capitol was.

When he transferred the James River Canal
Company stock to Lexington, Washington wrote
something about promoting literature and the arts
“in this rising Empire...”

The use of Empire with a capital “E’’ in
reference to our red, white and blue ‘‘Democracy”’
says something about Washington. He brought an
Imperial air to the office which some — including
his secretary of state, Thomas Jefferson — con-
sidered gauche and inappropriate. T.J., in fact,
despised the grand balls or levees thrown by
George and Martha in their New York mansion.

Americans generally like this kind of thing
—especially when they can afford it. And while
many obviously don’t get off on Ronnie and Nan-
cy’s glitzy hob-nobs, some people do. No one here
has sallied forth to condemn such a display of
opulence, or even decadence, in these economical-
ly troubled times.

So anyhow — perhaps Fancy Dress — par-
ticularly the ball — can be attributed in a round-
about manner to a man who never even slept here
(Natural Bridge doesn’t count). That is to say,
Washington saved our school and made formal
entertaining officially 0.K.

Of course, neither Washington nor Robert E.
Lee, who left a more tangible legacy to the school,
lived to see the dawn of the Fancy Dress Era. God
knows if they could see what goes on now, both of
them — especially the Confederave Saint — would
spin in their respective crypts.

Washington loved dance and drink and Lee en-
joyed cutting rugs in his youth, but his ideas on
alcohol may be plainly read over in Warner Center
(ironically where intoxicated FDers will stroll),
hung on the wall to strengthen the fiber of athletes
on training rules.

If the General could return and mount Traveller
for a tour of Lexington Friday night he would be
initially shocked, then repulsed and ultimately
horrified at some of the goings-on — discreet and
otherwise. It would be difficult for him to com-
prehend such behavior and he would probably con-
clude that chivalry is dead and that his school is
not in the business of turning out gentlemen
anymore.

Times have changed since Lee expired just a
few yards from where we buy supplies and munch
BLTs. We are the gentlemen of today, as any
subscriber to Gentlemen’s Quarterly will tell you.
Lee’s definition of the term was rooted in values,
not a dress code.
 

FD: Nostalgia

Nostalgia is chic and memory
speaks: Fancy Dress Ball, 1942.

To this New England college
girl in the years just before
World War II there were three
events of prime social
significance. Dartmouth Car-
nival, The Harvard-Yale game
and Washington and Lee Fancy
Dress Ball. Although I didn’t
know where or what Washing-
ton and Lee was, I had certainly
heard of its Ball. I succeeded in

excuse that they must practice
for the figure which opened the
Ball.

At nine-thirty the doors of the
old gym were locked against all
late arrivals and the fanfare
began with an intricate figure.
The ladies in long, full white
dresses, each carrying an arm-
ful of bright red roses; their
escorts in white-tie and tails,
red roses in their button holes.
For a half-hour they wove a pat-

getting to Dartmouth Carnival
and Harvard-Yale game right
on schedule but dancing at Fan-
cy Dress didn’t come along until
I was well on the way to becom-
ing a Lexington matron — and
quite visibly Motherhood.

The 1942 Fancy Dress Ball
had an awful poignancy. The
United States was at war follow-
ing the attack on Pearl Harbor
two months before. The
students of that year could look
ahead to only one future
— military service.

The aura of special elegance
was over us all. The invitation
was as elaborate as a command
appearance before the King of
England, (with an _ enclosed
numbered card to be presented
at the door). One thousand
glamourous costumes were
shipped from Philadelphia to be
rented out to each couple for the
large sum of $5. Girls arrived in
town days ahead — using the

tern of turns, bows and spins.
Nobody staggered; no one saw
— or smelled — any sign of
alcohol. That alcohol was
around we did not doubt — but it
was discreetly nipped.

The floor stayed crowded
—and dry — until intermission
at one o’clock. Then on we went
to a “‘Supper.”” Ham, roast beef,
scalloped oysters, molded
salads — ending with a fantasy
dessert of sherbet draped in
spun sugar! The conversation
was light and local, for this
night we kept the world at bay.

We danced all night and
breakfasted in party clothes —
wilted red roses tossed away
—or even taken home to be
pressed in memory. By June
the campus was empty of its
dancers, not to be filled up
again for four years — and
when it did the world had
changed forever.

Changes By Rasmussen Improve duPont

by Alan Armitage

The duPont Art Gallery on the
Washington and Lee campus
has undergone some changes in
the past year all of which seem
to have been beneficial to the
gallery.

The first change was the ap-
pointment of William Ras-
mussen, an assistant professor
of art at Washington and Lee, to
the position of director of the
gallery.

Rasmussen, a Washington
and Lee graduate, worked for
the Virginia Museum in Rich-
mond for 4-1/2 years before
returning to W&L to be director
of duPont Gallery. At the
Virginia Museum, Rasmussen
was in charge of the children’s
_ educational exhibits.

“In Richmond I was in charge
of only one small aspect of the
entire museum,’’ said
Rasmussen, ‘“‘where as here
I’m responsible for the whole
operation of the gallery.”’

The other changes made in
the gallery over the past year
were part of the renovation of
the gallery. The walls have all
been redone to look more ap-
pealing, and a pair of glass
doors have been installed at the
entrance to give people in the
hall a view into the gallery

which might attract them in.

‘I would like to see more stu-
dent interest,’’ said Ras-
mussen. ‘‘Students who are tak-
ing art classes have to walk
through the gallery to get to
their classes, but very few other
students are aware of the ex-
hibits. I hope that students pass-
ing by and seeing the exhibits
will be drawn in.”

The gallery is geared mainly
toward W&L students. Exhibits
are kept on display for approx-
imately 3 weeks on the average.
‘In Richmond we would keep
an exhibit for 2 months or more
on the assumption that most
people don’t go to the museum
any more often than that,”’ said
Rasmussen. ‘‘But here at
Washington and Lee, with the
students coming’ through
several times a week to go to
class and very few townspeople
coming in, three weeks is a suf-
ficient period of time for an ex-
hibit.”

The exhibit schedule for the
1982-83 academic year was
finalized before W&L’s
Christmas break. ‘‘Some artists
enquire about exhibiting their
works, and others we have to go
look for,” said Rasmussen. ‘‘We
try to have at least one painter,
one sculptor, one print exhibit,

and then other exhibits, in-
cluding student shows and ex-
hibits on loan from the Virginia
Museum, to fill out the year.”’

According to Rasmussen, the
artists decide which pieces they
want to exhibit and submit a list
to him. He then has to discuss
with the artist exactly how and
where the piece can best be ex-
hibited.

“After getting an idea of what
the artist wants, I have to

design a floor plan, a lighting

such as lattice-work,” Ras-
mussen said. ‘“‘Then, with some
student help, I set up the ex-
hibit. It takes about five hours
to set up and light an average
size exhibit.’’

Rasmussen feels that the
renovations have’ been
beneficial to the gallery by
making it easier for him to pre-

sent an exhibit in the best possi-
ble way. ‘‘I think that once the
community sees that we can
present a good exhibit in a pro-
fessional manner, interest in
the gallery will grow,”’ he said.

The gallery is open to the

Fancy Dress 1982:
Night Of Elegance

by John Wells
Who cares if they went over

‘budget? The SAB turned out

what many consider to be the
best Fancy Dress in memory,
and that’s what counts.

The great success of the ball
was due largely to its relocation
in Warner Center — a move
which also contributed to the
cost overruns. But it was truly
an elegant, swellegant party.

Things started rolling Thurs-
day night when Cameron Hall
was filled with spectators to see
Atlanta Rhythm Section get
down. ARS isn’t a very attrac-
tive group, but it performed
dutifully in the face of a typical-
ly apathetic W&L audience
response.

The real fun that night was at
Zoliman’s Pavillion, where
brews were hoisted to the tunes
of Johnny Sportcoat and the
Casuals, who wowed the crowd
with their usual finesse. For-
tunately, the pavillion was not
as mobbed as it tends to be on
these occasions.

The ball was tremendous.
Those who parked in the vicini-
ty of the old train station were
treated to a fine view of Warner
gym, glittering with lights and
framed by the giant shafts of
lunar light that rivaled any
Hollywood premiere.

Coat-checking was orderly

and swift; faculty folks had
cocktails at Lee House before-
hand and a tiny room was set up
on the 300 level of the gym for
members of the SAB, E.C.
Calyx and Ring-tum Phi staffs.
Peons not falling into any of
those categories presumably
stashed flasks or relied on tap-
ped beer which flowed
ceaselessly.

The Diamond Jubilee
ballroom was dreamy: black
and white, sparkling white
trees, beautiful lighting and
gloriously-lit balloons hung in
luminescent bunches like glow-
ing pearly grapes. Lester Lanin
and his orchestra were at their
finest, with some delightful
vocals from. various band
members. Unfortunately the
band did tend to play some
tunes over and over (‘‘In the
Mood,” ‘New York, New
York,” and ‘“‘Tomorrow”’ from
‘Annie’ come to mind) and
seemed to think minks like to
boogie down to the emotional
strains of ‘‘Dixie.’’ Most people
probably didn’t care, anyway.

; The Champs d’Elysees was fun
if only as a place to pause to

take in the splendid view of the -

merry-making below. The Las
Vegas-Roaring Twenties-Monte
Carlo room was hot and crowd-
ed, and some partygoers who
didn’t go in may have missed a

great band, Eight to the Bar,
which also performed at SAE
the following night.

Doremus Gym — site of most

previous Fancy Dresses until

the Student Center came along

— was hung with a silvery tent »

and banners proclaiming past
F.D. themes. The room was
also hot, but never so much as
when Skip Castro lit up the
stage at 12 for ‘‘Boogie at Mid-
night” and the crowd went wild.
Skip was in excellent form,
strutting the stage and roaming
through the audience. Great

lighting. Anyone who wasn’t in-
terested could glide along with
Lester for the remaining time.

And it really went by too fast.

Young belles from near and
far swept along in their dresses,
which ranged from antebellum
hoops to current Princess Di-
inspired ruffled taffeta in
Shades of white, pink and light
blue. The men were quite
dignified-looking, some of them
in pretentious tails which were
stunning until you looked close
and saw that the shirt and tie
material resembled the cloth

 

they use in those big rolls of
bathroom hand-drying
dispensers. There were a few
nauseating tie-and-cumberbund
combos (the pink and green had
to go) and a pair of red pants
advertising a favorite soft
drink.

It was less crowded than the
Student Center used to be,
although not much cooler (bet-
ter access to outdoors) and less
liquid appeared to be spilled on
the floor, although that didn’t
prevent some from sliding all
over the place and eating tile. I
don’t think they cared, either.

Survey Indicates Most W&L Grads Finding Jobs

by Graham Osteen

Most Washington and Lee
graduates are seeking and fin-
ding employment and fewer are
going to graduate schools today
than in the past five years.

Every other fall, Michael
Cappeto, director of the Office
of Career Development and
Placement at W&L, conducts a
survey of recent Washington
and Lee graduates to determine
their employment and graduate
school paths.

According to Cappeto, the
survey was conducted on a
yearly basis until this year.
Because the results have varied
so slightly, it has been decided
to conduct the survey every
other year.

Cappeto. has found that
follow-up studies of recent
graduates are most valid when
conducted four to six months
after graduation, so the survey
is begun in October following
graduation.

A questionnaire designed to
provide information concerning
full-time graduate study, job
classification, starting salary,
career orientation and sugges-
tions for the Office of Career
Development and Placement is
mailed with a stamped, self-
addressed envelope to the
members of the recent
graduating class.

The response rate for the
Class of 1980, which is the most
recent survey available, was
83.2 percent, according to Cap-

peto. Of the 267 graduates who
responded, 30.2 percent entered
graduate and_ professional
schools as full-time students.
The other 59.4 percent of the
respondents are employed
while 10.6 percent are
unemployed, not seeking
employment, traveling, etc.
The five year average for full-
time graduate school atten-
dance is 34 percent.

Law school has proved to be
the most popular field of
graduate study. Of the Class of
1980, 14 percent of the class
entered law school on a full-
time basis, according to Cap-
peto, and this figure has re-
mained fairly constant over the
past five years.

Business school attendance
has showed a decline over the
past five years and only 2.7 per-

cent of the Class of 1980 pursued
MBA programs as _ full-time
students, according to Cappeto.

Cappeto said medical school
attendance has remained fairly
constant with 4.4 percent of the
Class of 1980 entering graduate
programs in medicine.

Graduate programs other
than law, business and
medicine received 8.9 percent
of the Class of 1980, according to
Cappeto, this figure has varied
only slightly from year to year.

As stated earlier, 59.4 percent
of the Class of 1980 obtained
jobs after graduation. The five
year average is 57.4 percent, ac-
cording to Cappeto.

To determine the type of work
recent graduates enter,
respondents were asked to
select the category which best
describes their present job. The
business professions, education
and the military were the most
popular careers of the Class of
1980, according to Cappeto.

“It is appropriate to differen-
tiate between a job and a
career,” said Cappeto.

‘According to most occupa-
tional therapists, a career is a
type of work composed of one or
more related jobs. Statistics
show that during his working
life, the typical college student
graduate will have three dif-'
ferent careers composed of
twelve different jobs. Also, to-
day’s college graduate is ex-
pected to keep his first job for
about two years,” said Cappeto.

According. to Cappeto, 53.2
percent of graduates who were
not entering graduate school
had received job offers on or
before graduation day. About 10
percent of the graduates receiv-
ed jobs in each of the five mon-
ths following graduation so that
by late October, only 7.6 percent
of the Class of 1980 remained
unemployed.

‘Unemployment affects only
an insignificant number of re-
cent W&L graduates,’’ said
Cappeto.

For the past five years, about
half of the graduates seeking
employment received job offers
during the summer months.

Based on this finding, according
to Cappeto, it is concluded that
seniors who are unemployed on
graduation day should not
become pessimistic about their
future.

According to Cappeto, labor
market specialists believe that
underemployment, the
underutilization of skills, educa-
tion and human resources, is
the most critical problem fac-
ing today’s college graduate.
Data gathered on the Class of
1980 revealed considerably less
underemployment than the
Class of 1979. Eighty-four per-
cent of the respondents who had
full-time jobs indicated that
their jobs required a college
degree. This figure is up
substantially from the previous
four years which averaged 69.5
percent.

Cappeto’s study shows that
92.6 percent of the humanities
graduates, 90.9 percent of the
journalism graduates, 90.7 per-
cent of the business graduates,
77.8 percent of the science
graduates, and 76.7 percent of
the social science graduates
who had full-time jobs reported
that their jobs required a col-
lege degree.

_ According to the study, those
students who reported that their
degree was not being utilized
showed a surprisingly diverse
cross-section of jobs ranging
from ‘‘young professional’ to
manual labor positions. It can
be inferred from this finding

that some Washington and Lee
graduates are definitely
underemployed while others
have obtained jobs for which
they feel overqualified, but
which a college education is
nonetheless required or prefer-
red for employment, according
to Capneto.

For the Class of 1980, the
degree of job satisfaction was
moderately high, and, accor-
ding to Cappeto, this trend has
remained constant for Wash-
ington and Lee graduates.

Of the respondents, 85.7 per-
cent of the workers indicated
that they were satisfied with
their job’s challenge; 67.3 per-
cent of the graduates who work-
ed full-time responded that
their job was consistent with
long range career goals; 67.9
percent of the graduates were
satisfied with their salary; 84.9
percent were satisfied with the
type of work they were doing
and most were able to find work
where they wanted to live
rather than being forced to go
where their jobs were located.

The median salary range for
Washington and Lee graduates
was $12,000 to $12,999, up $1,000
from 1979. Science graduates
had the highest median, $14,000
to $14,999 followed by the
business graduates, $13,000 to
$13,999, the humanities and
social science’ graduates,
$11,000 to $11,999 and the jour-
nalism graduates, $9,000 to
$9,999.

Cappeto Explains Job Market

by Tom Baker
High unemployment and a
depressed job market for col-
lege graduates are two factors
that have created concern for

college seniors across the coun-,

try, including many Waphing-
ton and Lee seniors.

According to Director. ,of
Placement Mike Cappeto, W&L
seniors, while not coed

from the problems of the
depressed job market, tradi-
tionally do well on the job
market.

In fact, the number of com-
panies conducting interviews at
W&L has increaséd: by’ three

Cappeto cited several reasons
for the success W&L graduates
have had in the job market.

First, W&L graduates have
performed well in their chosen
fields, enhancing the reputation
of the university in the business
community. ‘‘W&L produces a
good product,’’ said Cappeto.

Second, the Placement Office
“bombards”’ seniors with pro-
grams and workshops on fin-
ding employment.

Third, the office encourages
seniors to”begin their job hun-
ting early.

Fourth, the fact that W&L
students tend to look for work in
the economically prosperous
South (the ‘‘Sun Belt’’ region)
rather than the depressed
Northeast and Midwest in (the
“Snow Belt’’).

According to Cappeto, the
students who get the good jobs
are the ones who have a better
knowledge of the job hunting
process. Those that are
prepared are involved in a com-
prehensive job search. These
graduates know what they want
to do specifically and have con-
ducted a thorough analysis of
the job market to know what op-
portunities are available and
where they can be found.
 

 

 

A Film Of ‘Marble’

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will present Man of
Marble, directed by interna-
tionally recognized Polish
filmaker Andrzej Wajda, on
Friday and Saturday in Class-
room A of Lewis Hall. The
public is invited free of charge
to attend the screenings.

According to Carren O.
Kaston, assistant professor of
English at Washington and Lee
and adviser to the W&L Film
Society, Wajda’s films are
“remarkable for their ability to
show the meaning of politics in
human terms. They reveal that
history and politics are a part of
the people’s most intimate
lives.”’

Wajda was arrested by the
Polish government in the wake
of the military takeover in that
country in December. He has
since been released.

“The film Society decided to
assume the considerable cost of
showing Man of Marble
because this seems. the
politically appropriate moment
to bring Wajda’s work to Lex-
ington,”’ said Kaston.

Until recently, Wajda was
best known in the United States
for his early trilogy: A Genera-
tion (1955), Kanal (1956), and
Ashes and Diamonds (1958).

At present, two of Wajda’s
works are playing in New York
City: Without Anesthesia and
Man of Iron. The latter is the se-
cond film in a projected trilogy
in which Man of Marble is the’
first. Man of Iron has just been
nominated for this year’s
Academy Award despite

 

‘Il Barbiere

di Siviglia’

i Sivigl

Rossini’s popular comic
opera, ‘‘I] Barbiere di Siviglia,”’
which returned to the Met’s
repertory last month in a new
production, will be broadcast
live from the Metropolitan
Opera House on Sat., March 13,
at 2 p.m. over WLUR - FM
(91.5).

The cast for the broadcast
features Kathleen Battle as
Rosina; William Workman in
his Metropolitan Opera radio
broadcast debut as Figaro;
Rockwell Balke as Count
Almaviva; Renato Capeechi as
Doctor Baetolo, and Paolo Mon-
tarsolo, also in his Metropolitan
radio debut, as Don Basilio. An-
drew Davis is the conductor.

Written by Rossini when he
was only 25, “Il Barbiere di
Siviglia” is one of the most
popular operas in the repertory.
It is a charming story of
romance, disguises and playful
trickery set in 17th Century

Spain.
The single intermission
feature is ‘‘Texaco’s Opera

Quiz,’’ with panelists Martin
Bernheimer of the Los Angeles
Times; Martin Sokol, noted
teacher and author; and Paul
Hume of the Washington Fost.

 

Poland’s request that it be
withdrawn from competition.
Man of Iron , which concerns
the rise of the trade union
Solidarity in the Gdansk
shipyards, was smuggled out of
Poland just before the military
takeovet. Wajda’s subsequesnt

arrest gained international
notoriety.
Wajda had to seek permission

from the Polish government for
13 years before he was allowed
to make Man of Marble in 1977.
Still, the film was judged so
politically threatening that one
of its last scenes was censored.
Although the Polish authorities
refused to allow Man of Marble
to be officially screened at the
Cannes Film Festival, it re-
ceived the festival’s 1978 Inter-
national Critic’s Prize when the
French distributed it in a com-
mercial theatre in Cannes.

According to Kaston, Man of
Marble is much like the widely-
read novel ‘‘The Painted Bird,”’
by Polish author Jerzy Kozinski
in that the film concerns the dif-
ficulty with which the Polish
people achieve a sense of
‘*solidarity’’ among
themselves.

“In their tendency to suspect
and push away from each other,
Wajda seems to say the people
of Poland are their own worst
enemies, and it is in this context
that the brief triumph of
Solidarity was so especially
moving,” said Kaston.

The plot of Man of Marble
focuses on the efforts of a con-
temporary filmmaker, a feisty
young woman who encounters
many of the same obstacles as
Wajda himself, to make a
television documentary about
Mateusz Birkut, a_ heroic
worker lionized by the govern-
ment on Poland’s post-World
War II Stalinist period. Birkut
was even commemorated in
government documentaries and
government art — the marble
sculpture of the title — but has
disappeared from view.

Laundry Room Under Fire

by B. Scott Tilley

Much criticism has evolved
this year over the laundry
facilities, provided mainly for
freshmen, in the basement | of
Graham-Lees Dormitory. |

The complaints generally
recognize two major faults. of
the facility: the ineffectiveness
of the machines and the lack ‘of
security provided.

Freshman David McGehee
noted that ‘the dryers don’t
work well, and you usually have
to run them three or four
times.”” McGehee said he used
to use the Graham-Lees facili-
ty, but. now it’s ‘‘more conve-
nient touse a laundromat.” _

Wood Selig, a junior and a
dorm counselor, pointed out
that although the washers are
50 cents, as compared to 75
cents at a laundromat, ‘“‘you
don’t save any money because
you have.to run the dryer more.
It’s unfortunate they’re not in
better condition because it
would be more convenient for
the students in the dorms.”

Mike Shelton is one of several
students who have had clothes
missing from the laundry room.
Shelton claims his laundry had
been searched and four dress
shirts were deliberately taken.
Why did he leave them ex-
posed? ‘Because I couldn't
wait ‘en eternity for them to
dry,” he explained.

According to Dee Miriello,
who is in charge of handling
complaints about the laundry
room, the failure to remedy the
problem can be attributed to the
lack of feedback from students.
Mrs. Miriello’s boss, Gerry
Darrell, confirmed _ that
student have not stepped for-
ward with complaints.

“‘T had no idea that situation is
so bad,”’ said Mrs. Miriello. ‘‘If
they will call me when the
machines break down or don’t
work, I will reimburse them
and have Buildings and
Grounds repair the machine.”

Darrell added that if he
receives enough complaints
about one faulty machine, he

said that no machines have

As for security in the laundry

Miriello agree that responsibili-
ty is out of their hands. Darrell
suggested locking the door after
a certain time, a practice that
used to be followed when the
Graham-Lees dorm was oc-
cupied. Ultimate responsibility
for the building is not under
Darrell’s authority, however.

Mrs. Miriello concluded, ‘“‘If

SAB Holds
Meeting

by J.R°5mith
The atmosphere was rather
jovial at the Student Activities
Board meeting Tuesday night,
even though the major topic of
discussion was the $15-20,000 the
S.A.B. lost on Fancy Dress

weekend.
Co-chairman John Martin of-

fered that the S.A.B. is not in
trouble in the eyes of the ad-
ministration because it was the
administration who told the
board to count on selling 2,000
tickets. Only 1,400 tickets were
sold.

In other discussions, the
S.A.B. announced movies for
the weekend. My Fair Lady
will be shown at 7:30 p.m. on
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
The other feature, a porn flick
entitled Misty Beethoven, will
be shown at 10 p.m. and 12 p.m.
Friday and Saturday, and at 10
p.m. on Sunday. Admission to
My Fair Lady is $1. Admission
to the skin flick is $2.

Review:

‘Reds’ Should Earn

by Michael Judge

Warren Beatty’s magnum
opus, Reds, now playing at the
Lyric Theatre, is the most ad-
mirable and _ distinguished
American film of 1981. While
the current comparisons are
now being made between Reds
and other classics such as Dr.
Zhivago and Lawrence of
Arabia, Reds is certainly the
most ambitious undertaking by
an American filmmaker in re-
cent years.

The theme of the movie is a
grand one — the life of jour-
nalist John Reed, who chronicl-
ed and took an active part in the
Russian revolution of 1917. In
less adept hands, the film could

have become what so many

other American films do: a
mixture of empty spectacle and
stilled characterization (e.g.
Heaven’s Gate).

Yet Warren Beatty’s beau-
tifully controlled direction
treats the subject with in-
telligence and passion, and,
during a time when so many
American films cater to the
psychologically trivial, its
achievement is substantial. _

Perhaps what is so refreshing
about this film is that it appears
at a time when so many other
American films seem to be
catering to the trivial and nar-
cisstic aspects of modern life. It
is a pity to think that Reds’

Reds, though, is flawed.
However, it never condescends
nor surrenders its emotional
and intellectual integrity. While
powerful and moving, it never
resorts to strident emo-
tionalism to achieve its effect.

Despite strong direction, the
film’s real strength lies on the
intelligence of its script and the
brilliance of its cast. Warren
Beatty gives a steady and deep-
ly felt performance as John
Reed. Reed, led by convictions
to take personal involvement in
the Russian revolution, faces
bitter disappointment over the
corruption of the new Soviet
state. Yet he clings stubbornly
to his ideals up to the end. Beat-
ty asks us to recognize that
Reed is both a naive victim of
history and an example of an in-

Lax Team Dumped 16-7,

Will Face Navy Saturday

Hoping to regroup forces
after an ambush last Sunday
against a top club team, the
Washington and Lee lacrosse
team will battle the Naval
Academy this Saturday at 2
».m. on Wilson Field.

Sports

“We expect a_ typically
agressive Navy team,” said
Head Coach Jack Emmer. “On
defense they try to force you to
handle the ball under great
pressure. On offense they will
try to power their way to a goal
rather than using a settled at-
tack.”’

“Our success will depend on
control of the ball and especial-
ly control of the game’s tempo.
But Navy will make these tough

objectives to achieve,’ said
Emmer.

The match will be the ninth
meeting of the teams in a series
that was played in 1977, when
Navy edged W&L 13-12 on
Wilson Field. The visitors held
an 11-7 advantage late in the
third period before the Generals
closed the gap to 12-11.

Other scores from this close
series include a 1976 victory by
Navy (8-7), another win by the
academy in 1975 (14-8), a 19-8
Navy win in 1972 and a 10-8
Navy win in 1971. W&L has
beaten Navy a few times,
however. In 1974, the Generals
swept the Midshipmen twice in-

cluding an 11-9 win in the
N.C.A.A. tournament. W&L

also defeated Navy in the 1973
tournament, that score being
13-12.

Baseball Season Starts

by Andrew Hoppes

Coach Jim Murdock’s
Washington and Lee baseball
team will open its 1982 season
this weekend with home games
against West Virginia Tech on
Friday and Saturday and
California State (Pa.) on Sun-
day.

Co-captain Jeff Haggerty, a
.362 hitter last season, will start
at first base. Juniors Chris
Cavalline and Jody Harris will
anchor the middle of the infield,
while sophomore Dave War-
renfeltz will hold down third
base.

Tripp Brower will do the cat-
ching for the Generals. Mur-
dock described Brower as a
good team leader and one of the
best defensive catchers in the
0.D.A.C.

The outfield alignment is not
definite, but four-year letter-
man and captain Thad Ellis will
definitely be patroling center-

field. Ellis hit .393 to earn Divi-
sion III All-American honors as
a sophomore, but was hamp-
ered by a wrist injury last year
and slumped to .264.

Sophomore Mike Walsh, a
strong offensive player, will
probably occupy leftfield. In
rightfield, freshman Miles
Spencer and sophomore Mel
Cote appear to be the leading
candidates.

In the pitching department,
five seniors will lead the W&L
staff. Dave Randall and Rich
Hachenburg will be part of the
starting rotation, while the
other seniors, Jim Brockelman,
Don Dudley and Mark
McLaughlin, will also find plen-
ty of action. Junior Jim Stanley
and freshman Billy White fill
out the pitching staff.

Randall, Hachenburg and
Brockelman, were team leaders
among last. year’s pitchers.

game is that Navy’s coach,
Dick Slaza, was the coach at
Washington and Lee _ before
heading to Anappolis.

According to Emmer, Navy’s
top personnel this season are
junior goaltender Scott Bart-
kowski, junior attackman Rob
Bianchi and Rick Wehman,
junior midfielders Phil
Skalniak and Richard Hayes,
and senior defenseman John
Korn.

W&L’s loss last week came at
the hands of the Mt. Washington
Club. The host Wolfpack used
its experienced players to hand
the Generals a 16-7 loss.

“They moved well, found the
open man well when we didn’t
pick up fast enough on
defense,” said Emmer. ‘‘They
scored a lot of goals that way.”’

W&L leaders were Geoff
Wood and Lee Heimert, who
scored two goals apiece. In
goal, Ware Palmer collected
eight saves, Mark Lukes had
four and Phil Aiken three.

Saturday’s match is the first
of three straight at home for the
Generals. W&L will play host to
Lafayette on Wednesday and
North Carolina State next
Saturday.

Veterans Pace W&L Golfers

by B. Scott Tilley

Washington and Lee’s golf
team, coming of a 12-0 dual
match record in 1981, has high
aspirations for the upcoming
year, hopefully culminating
with a championship in the
ODAC Tournament to be held
April 26-27 at Hampden-Sydney.

Coach Buck Leslie explained
that this team, as in past years,
has three goals. ‘‘We want to
have a successful dual match
season, we want to do as well as
we can in our tournaments, ex-
pecially the ODAC, which we’ll
be out to win, and finally, to

earn a NCAA berth at the end of
the year, which is highly com-
petitive but possible if we turn
in some good, low numbers dur-
ing the season,”’ he explained.
The success of the Generals
this year will rest upon their
veteran players. Senior co-
captains Bill Alfano and Jim
Kaplan are joined by class-
mates Titus Harris and Del
Agnew. Junior Tim Webb and
sophomores Whit Kelly and
Bruce Blythe will also con-
tribute, according to Leslie.
Though it is a veteran team,

Leslie stressed that he is
developing competition for the
starting spots to press the
seniors and to prepare the
younger players for next year.
The team opened its season
Monday and Tuesday in the
NCAA Division III, District III
Tournament in Sanford, North
Carolina. Leslie was very pleas-
ed with the squad’s showing,
which saw them place third
amond a field of 17 teams. They
carded a 633, finishing only
behind Methodist College and

Page 6, The Ring-tum Phi, March 11, 1982

 

Bennett Ross, the winner of the E.C, presidency in Monday's Big Three
elections, was interviewed the night of his victory by Ring-tum Phi
Vews Editor Todd Smith.

Phi: This year was marked by the telephone co-op, the Intellectual
Symposium, the constitutional revisions. What new ideas do you
see on the horizon for next year's E.C.?

Ross: As far as this year’s ideas are concerned, both the telephone
cooperative and the Intellectual Symposium are going to need a lot
of revisions. We’re still in the early planning phases. I don’t see the
Student Telephone Union, as it’s been officially dubbed, I don’t see

President-Elect

Ross Lays Out

that getting going until next year and that’s going to take a lot of
leg-work. As far as the Intellectual Symposium, the real test of that
is going to be this Spring, in preparation for getting things going the
next year. Bascially my plans for next year concern issues that I
think are relevant to students at the university, for example,
delayed rush. I think the Executvie Committee needs to look at
that. I would like to think the committee’s emphasis next year will
be on those issues, that we’re going to spend as much time on issues
that are of concern to students outside of the realm of the honor
system. I'd like to think that we could put that time into concerns of
students that fall outside of lying, cheating or stealing. Basically,
what about rush, what is the future of fraternities here on campus,
these kinds of basic questions. I think we need to be a little more
receptive, not just to complaints, but to suggestions about certain
aspects of the university.

Phi: I have heard that for every hour you spend in open Monday
night meetings, you spend three hours on honor matters.

Ross: That’s basically true.

Phi: If that’s basically true. how can you propose getting more
actively involved in everyday issues ?

Ross: The majority of the time spent at Monday night meetings is
spent simply to cover financial reports of the various subcommit-
ties, and that’s it. There’s no reason why we can’t cover other
issues at Monday night meetings. And it requires that we establish
a subcommmittee that works. We've established the Mock Intellec-
tual Symposium committee. If it takes that to work outside the
realm of the Executive Committees on Monday night, then that's
what we'll have to do. I think that given the fact we have this dual
role of being the primary body of the student government and the
judicial board, I think we should spend an equal proportion of time
doing both. I mean, obviously, our main concern is_ the
maintenance of the honor system. That’s why we're really here.
But I still think that it’s not necessary that we ignore issues thst as
student government officials we should take care of.

 

“We sit in a committee room

’

with a very limited scope.’

“what is this check here? Todd Smith for $8.99?” We have a list of
every penny that goes out of the account. The vice-president has it
on his desk. He should be able to take care of the information, at
least questions that he might have outside of regular Monday night
meetings. Think about it, we get a financial report that says
‘Miscellaneous — $300.’’ We don’t know where that money goes,
only the vice-president does and whoever sees the printout. I think
more can be done in financial aspects outside the meetings.

Phi: When you go into budget hearings next September, are you go-
ing to have some plan, or just a notion in the back of your minds, as

John Viahoplus has said, that you will consider the proportion of the
student body served by the budgeted organization?

Ross: I’m not sure, I don’t know exaclty how much we are going to
be working with anyway. (Ross stated that the student tax will rise
by $5). Given that increase in the pool, I really haven’t sat down
and thought out where it ought to go. But as far as general
budgeting procedure, I think one of the shortcomings of our process
is that we don’t have in front of the committee what the subcom-
mittee has spent in the past. It would be helpful, say, in the fall of
1982 to say ‘‘Here is what they requested in the fall of '81, here’s the
final year-end report in '82. Compare exactly how accurate they
were, for instance. Take the Outing Club which right now has
almost $15,000 in the account. We can say next year, given that
balance, that maybe they don’t need that much next year. As far as
saying ‘‘A certain amount of students participate in that activity,
therefore it should get a certain percentage of funds,”’ I'm not sure
that’s accurate. When you're talking percentages, it’s very hard to
estimate to what degree you're going to be able to cover projects
and plans. I'd like to see all the budget proposals, given a fixed sum
that we have to budget, cut out a lot of crap — sorry we can’t pay

‘for your parties, sorry we can’t pay for your receptions, this looks

reasonable, it’s yours. We don’t pass judgement on the Ariel or the
Ring-tum Phi, or those committees that provide a service. We don't
say, ‘‘Well, approximately 68.9 of all students read the paper and
therefore you should get these funds,’’ We say, ‘‘Well,. this is
reasonable. You provide a service therfore it’s yours.’ I think
this, coupled with the knowledge of what was done in the past.

Phi: You said you would like to see student opinion brought in on

 

 

Phi: Again, it’s just a question of pragmatics. Other schools have
solved the problem by dividing those primary roles of government.
For example, girls’ schools. Can you cite schools that do it the way
we do?

Ross: I can’t think of any off hand, but I’m not really well-versed in
schools of our size and schools with the unique honor system we
have.

Phi: What's so unique about our honor system?

Ross: You'll be surprised to find that not many honor systems are
geared towards a hearing. Most are actual adversarial systems
where there is a prosecution and there’s a defense. | cited, I guess,
last week that at Virginia Tech the average time for an in-
vestigative team to come back with a possible honor violation and
the actual hearing is three to four weeks. I think that would justify
splitting. Given the fact that we can send the investigative out, and
decide to go to the hearing, have the hearing, all within the span of
three or four days, I think that it’s conceivable we can do both. I
think maybe we ought to spend less time worrying about the
finances and spend a little more of the Monday night time devoted
to some of these issues.

Phi: Let’s go back to the subcommittees. In Willis’ year (last
year), the Phi applauded him for close monitoring of the student
funds and his tight reign on the subcommittees. How are you going
to keep up “heavy surveillance”’ and still have time in the meetings
for other matters?

Ross: At the end of every month the E.C. gets a computer print-
out of every check that that any subcommittee has written and any
deposit made. It’s printed out every for every account that we fund.
4 lot of the financial workings of each subcommittee can be dealt
with outside of Monday night meetings, I’m convinced. It will take
Morgan's (Griffith), the vice-president next year, sitting down with
the business manager of the Ring-tum Phi and saying

issues of delayed rush and coeducation. How will jou pull in student
opinion when students don’t write letters to the egitor, don’t come
to E.C. gripe nights. etc.?

Ross: If you accept the premise that we are representatives of the
student body, there is no reason why we as representatives can’t go
out and say, ‘Look, I’ve talked to these ten students and eight of
them were in favor of coeducation,” or just ask tig their opinions
on certain things. That’s not going to “sive accurate
statistical information. The only way you’re going to get that is
through surveys, that kind of stuff. What I want to know is, say, how

His Plans For An Effective Year

the students feel about parking. I mean parking js really bad at this
university. If you come up to campus you either get a two-hour
limit or you park in the ‘‘C’’ lot three miles from campus. That’s a
concern of some students, but they don’t want tosay it unless some
committee member says, ‘‘It sucks. It absolutely sucks, there’s no
parking on campus.”’ That’s a quote from some student. That’s one
means | don’t think we’ve utilized enough. Because we run into
students as committee members all the time, if you just stop and
say to someone you respect and has good judgement, ‘“‘What are
your concerns?’’ | grant that not many students wi!! come into your
gripe session and say, “‘It sucks,’’ but there’s no reason why we
can’t go out there and ask for comments.

Phi: How are you and the rest of the committee going to do this?
Ross: I think it can be put in such a way that it's not unreasonable
to think that every committee member be responsible to talk to
four, five students on a particular issue. We sit in a committee
room with a very limited scope. We tend to glorify the honor system
to an extent that maybe the ordinary student doesn’t. Or maybe it’s
not so high and almighty as we make it to be. We don’t know that,
we’re trying to maintain and upgrade and all that kind of stuff. At
U.Va. there was a survey that said that 25 percent of the student
body had seen an honor violation and nine percent admitted com-
mitting one. Do we have any of that information? Nooo...We have
no idea. We know the honor system is important here at W&L, but is
a similar occurence happening here at W&L as it was at U.Va.?
Well, we don’t know. Well, we ought to find out.
Phi: How are you going to get the E.C. todo that”

Ross: There are a lot of time restraints, people on the committtee
have a lot of other stuff besides the Executive Committee. But I do
not think it’s unreasonable to say, ‘‘Two weeks from now we're go-
ing to talk about Delayed Rush. I want to know the students’ views,
law students’ views, independents’ views, I want to know the views
of those students who are your constituents. Let's hear what they
have to say, not what YOU have to say.” I don't think that’s an
unreasonable working relationship, because that type of research
can be utilized. ;

Phi: And if it doesn’t work the first time, do you send them out?
Ross: I think it’s a function of leadership. It’s the president’s fault
if it doesn’t work because obviously I’m not getting across our
responsibilities, our responsibility to know how our constituents
feel. And if we don’t know that we’re not doing pur job. And if I
can’t translate that to committee members to fiiva out their consti-
tuency’s feelings, then I’m not doing my job. I hope that if Morgan
and Mike (Singer, Secretary-elect) and I go about it the right way,
it'll work. I think everybody on the committee knows his job. Cole
Dawson, for instance, is concerned about the freshman class and he
says he talks to people. And Morgan, for example, bringing in the
complaints. They’re sensitive issues and it’s just going to be put in
an organized system instead of just ‘‘a couple of students com-
plained to me about the sidewalks in winter.”

Phi: Perhaps instead of dividing the judicial from the legislative
side of the E.C., more importance could be given to established
bodies like the Universoty Council and the Interfraternity Council.
How do you perceive their roles?

Ross: The first thing to be done next year, this Spring, is to draw up
an organizational chart to say, ‘‘Here is our exact relationship with
Student Control, here is our relationship with all the faculty com-
mittees,’’ because we had problems appointing the chairman of
student control last year. We have problmes not treading on the
I.F.C.’s ground in talking about Delayed Rush. I think we need to
define those relationships before we decide upon to what extent
they exercise their rights and power in student government. I think
the I.F.C. is doing its responsibility as far as Delayed Rush.
However, given the fact that it represents a fraternity or an
organization, I don’t see how it can hurt to have the E.C., which
represents not only the 60 percent affiliated with fraternities, but
the 40 percent who don’t, to say, ‘‘Well, here’s how the other 40 per-
cent feel about Delayed Rush.”’ I’m not necessari-, Jure that that’s
going to be taken into account in the I.F.C.’s analysis. As for others,
the University Council, the Faculty Executive Committee, they
have their avenues of concern. I don’t know to what extent other-
wise they contribute to the interests of the students. There’s a lot of
potential for the U.C. I think they’ve at least discussed issues that
are relevant, and that’s the way it should be.

Griffith: A Law Student Vice President

by Todd Smith

Morgan Griffith, the first law student to be elected to a position ‘6 a4 ’
on the ‘‘Big Three’”’ since student body President Beau Duddley, The law students who go over and socialize dont
said ina Tuesday interview that he believed he knew enough about b : 2 ‘
the undergraduate campus to serve effectively as vice president. see Oarrlers. They are mostly perceived by those

‘I don’t perceive it as a problem because I intend to go out and ‘
solve it,”’ Griffith said. The second-year law representative to the who don't go across ‘the great divide.’”’

Executive Committee ran uncontested in Monday’s election,
gathering 554 votes.

‘‘When I started last year as senior law rep I had to learn the
committees that dealt with the E.C. I knew the basic ones, cold

. check, Contact, but I had to go out and learn the rest.

‘‘Now my work is before me. I’ve learned a tremendous amount
this year. Hopefully, I’ll learn a tremendous amount next year.”

In an interview shortly after the election, President-elect Bennett
Ross stated that he intended to have the E.C. spend less time during
Monday night meetings reviewing the expenditures of the subcom-
mittees.

Ross said he intended for the vice president to do most of that
himself, in his unofficial capacity as treasurer, in order to free the
E.C. to consider other matters.

Griffith disagreed with Ross’ suggestion.

‘You might think, ‘How boring,’ if you sat in on (the financial
review of subcommittees ), but I think it’s good to do it in the open.”

One division already in full force is that between the law school
student body and the undergraduates. Griffith noted, ‘There is a
difference. But it’s not a difference that should make the two cam-
puses separate.”

He noted that law students are coeducated and often a good deal
older than seniors. Some have been in the business world already,
others have attended much different universities. ‘‘I think it makes
a difference when you're competing with people who have been in
the house of delegates,’’ said Griffith.

‘I think it’s simply a matter of bringing (the two campuses)
together on certain issues. That's been my purpose in trying to get
people from the law school on cold check and Contact.”’

The law students who go over and socialize don’t see the barriers.
They are mostly perceived by those who don’t go across ‘the great
divide.’ ”’

“I think it’s more a problem of ignorance than anything else,”
said Griffith.

Griffith said that he intended to see the two campuses come
closer together, but that he did not “see forcing any mergers of the
two newspapers or the two annuals.”

 

 

 

 

 

 

“Now my work is before me.”

 

“I certainly wouldn’t mind doing it behind the scenes, but I feel
its a sign of more open government to have them there before the
committee, where anyone can come in and listen to them, and the
Ring-tum Phi can report on it.”’ SS

What Griffith does think needs s¢ritinization are the Accounts of |
the Executive Committee. f

“I have only one real program for next year in mind, and that is
that the E.C. would make a report every month after the budget
hearings to report where our $5,000 is going.”’

Griffith expressed less opposition ‘to dividing the E.C. into
legislative and honor bodies than did Ross. ‘‘I would have to see a
plan before I would think about approving it,” said Griffith.

“There are basically two arguments against such a division.
First, with the honor body considering matters in secret, there
would be no way for the student body to judge what kind of job
they’re doing. Second, it is argued that by working on both honor
and non-honor related matters the E.C. develops a working
chemistry. I don’t find the second argument persuasive.”

Griffith thought there could be ways around the first problem,
such as the student body president serving on both. ‘‘We could look
into the way other schools do, We should definitely look into this."’

 

Griffith sees the Executive Committee as the primary student
governing body. The University Council and the Faculty Executive
Committee are ‘‘a wealth of information,”’ but are primarily ad-
visory in their relation to the E.C.

“Those two bodies can offer us great assistance but I think we
have to take the responsibility,”’ said Griffith,

About the Inter-Fraternity Council, Griffith feels that the E.C.
should take an active role in consideration of a delayed rush.

‘I’ve developed the Viahopian (as in junior representative John
Vlahoplus) outlook,” said Griffith, “that any matter that is of in-
terest to the student body is of interest to the E.C.””

‘‘T think as a matter of courtesy, not jurisdiction, we should leave

(delayed rush) with the IFC. But it is our responsibility to look into VP. -Klect Morgan Griffi th

the decision when it’s made,”’ said Griffith.

Others Made
Their Own
Kind Of Fun

by Tom Baker

While everyone certainly en-
joyed themselves at the Fancy
Dress ball, some students got
into predicaments that made
their Friday evening par-
ticularly noteworthy.

The first predicament oc-
cured at the photographers’s
studio, which was located next
to the batting cage in the gym.
While one student’s date was
trying to pose for the photo-
grapher, she lost her balance
and tried to regain it by grabb-
ing her gentleman escort.

Suddenly, the couple com-
pletely lost its balance and the
man, in an effort to stay
upright, grapped the backdrop
that the photgrapher was using.
Rather than steadying himself,
the would-be mink ripped the
cloth from its frame. The photo-
grapher reacted to the crisis by
returning the couple’s deposit
and asking them to leave.

Another student, perhaps
bored with the bands in
Doremus Gym, decided to
create his own entertainment
by getting into a fight with
another fancy dresser. The
fight was quickly broken up by
surrounding students, but not
before the participants looked
like they had used their tuxedos
to wipe the gym floor.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Turner’s Retirement Criticized

 

 

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Big 3 Elections

Something new can be found in last Monday’s Big
Three elections —- competition. In th past, Big Three
elections have held all the drama of a Soviet referen-
dum. Usually only one person has the interest to run.
The result, as one might expect, has been a less than
enthusiastic following of the actions of the Executive
Committee.

But this year, we were actually blessed with the
novelty of having a competitive race for the E.C.
presidency. All three candidates, Bennett Ross, Jim
Averett and Peter Collins, should be congratulated
for their efforts to improve the Executive Committee.

In reviewing last Monday’s vote. the results are
fascinating. Ross walked away with slightly more
than half of the votes, while Averett and Collins split
the other half. Had Averett and Collins not divided the
same voting bloc, the possibility is very strong that
this campus would have seen a run-off for the
presidency.

The other two campaigns were more one-sided, but
again we must congratulate all those that chose to
run. Though one might scoff at the poor results earn-
ed by a write-in campaign, one must also respect a
candidate whose efforts provocate new issuies.

That is what a political campaign is about, after all.

Fancy Dress 1982

While we have the time, we’d also like to extend our
congratulations to the Student Activities Board for
giving us Fancy Dress 1982. The combined efforts of
John Martin, Blake Witherington and Bobby Schmidt
gave us one of the finest balls in recent memory.

From Thursday night to Friday night, the S.A.B.
provided all Fancy Dressers with the finest in enter-
tainment. Whether you enjoy rock, soul, beach or
swing music, it is likely the S.A.B. had someone to
suit your fancy.

One alarming note, however, is the cost overrun
that occured from last weekend’s activities. S.A.B.
Treasurer Randall Jacoby has estimated the losses as
anywhere between $15,000 and $20,000. Considering
that the S.A.B. was given $55,000 to play with, this is
indeed alarming.

The S.A.B. says that part of the loss is due to poor
attendence. The S.A.B. expected 2,000 tickets to be
purchased, but could sell only 1,400. This is a surprise,
considering that Fancy Dress 1982 was a jubilee and
all.

What should the Executive Committee do when
next year’s S.A.B. comes forth with its budget?
Should the E.C. cut back on the S.A.B.’s funds
because of the losses? In this case, we think not. The
S.A.B. was given its ill-fated ticket advice from the
administration. The S.A.B. was therefore not
, operating under a self-concerned delusion.

The fun of attending the Fancy Dress ball shows
that everyone enjoys a party. The shock about the

cost overruns shows, however, that nobody likes to
foot the bill.

Dear Sir:

During my four years at W&L,
I have seen several injustices
committed by the faculty’
and/or administration. For the
most part, I have accepted ad-:
ministrative changes in policy,
with little or no conviction to;

speak out against them. Well,

enough is enough!

It has recently come to my at-,
tention that Dr. Charles W.:
Turner of the history depart-.
ment is being forced into retire- '
ment after some 30-odd years of '
service to W&L. I feel this is an

outrage!

Currently, I am being taught:
by Dr. Turner and personally I’
can see no reason why an in-'
justice such as forced retire-

   
 

Jothe editor :

ment should be levied against
this man. He isa fine gentleman -

and an excellent lecturer. His
enthusiasm for teaching and

concern for his students is un- |

paralled at this university.
I don’t understand how a
school that preaches ‘‘the good

of the student is always first” —

can so easily do away with such
a fine professor.

I would propose that instead
of some sedentary faculty com-
mittee making such a decision
that the students themselves be
asked to voice their opinion.
This only makes sense, for it is
the student who will be affected
(and hurt) by this ruling.

Dr. Turner is a fine pro-

Laundry Blues

Dear Sir:

I have a problem that has
been bothering me more and
more. I am a freshman without
a car and, as a result, I am
forced ‘to use the washing
machines under the Graham-
Lees dorms.

There is only one thing that

can be said about those

machines. (Expletive deleted).

As for the washers, there have

been a few occasions when I
would actually still see stains on
clothes ‘after they came out. I
ended up scrubbing them in my
sink, and they did come clean.

The dryers are simply a joke.
I have taken clothes out of the
dryer and they seem wetter
than when I put them in. There
is only one dryer that works
fine. Sometimes it will actually
get my jeans dry. But on occa-
sion other dryers actually leave
my sheets wet.

It’s ridiculous! I would ap-
preciate it if someone would do |
something about the quality of
these machines, but frankly I
don’t care because I’ll never
use them again.

Sincerely,
Henry Dewing ’85

Some F.D. Reflections

Dear Sir:

On behalf of all our students
who benefit so much from
adverse publicity, I would
like to compliment the person
or persons who created the
sketch printed on this year’s
Fancy Dress T-shirts. We can
be sure that every student who
bought one of these garments
for his date will be proud to
have her display for us the kind
of intellectual curiosity or
superiority which we always
strive to exhibit and which is
reflected in the deplorable
mispelling of the French name,
‘‘Champs-Elysees.’’ Such

 

Washington and Lee University

deserves a rating higher than
three stars.

On the other hand, however,
although I would have prefer-
red that Fancy Dress occur dur-
ing the first week after vacation
instead of the second one, I can
only admire the energy,
creativity and general behavior
of all those who were responsi-
ble for and participated in Fan-
cy Dress activities. To all the
students who received us so
warmly and made us feel so
comfortable, my wife and I
wish to express our sincerest
thanks.

Yours as ever,
A.G. Fralin

E.C. Announces Winners, S.A.B. Explains Losses

by J.R. Smith
and Ben Jarratt

The Executive Committee an-
nounced the winners of the Big
Three elections and the Student
Activities Board announced its
losses from the Fancy Dress
weekend at Monday night’s
E.C. meeting.

Bennett Ross won the E.C.

presidential race, gathering 333
votes, or 51 percent of the total.
Jim Averett finished second
with 163 votes (25 percent), edg-
ing out Peter Collins, who col-
lected 156 votes (24 percent).
Senior Law Representative
H. Morgan Griffith ran unop-
posed for the E.C. vice-
presidency. Griffith collected a

total of 554 votes.

In the race for E.C. secretary,
Mike Singer defeated Pete
Baumgaertner. Singer amassed
473 votes to Baumgaertner’s 53.
Baumgaertner was running as
a write-in candidate.

dividual possessed of both
courage and dignity.

As Louise Bryant, Diane
Keaton contributes the finest
role of her outstanding career.
Though she holds many of
Reed’s ideals as her own,
Louise also holds her husband
in slight contempt for the
stridency with which he defends
his cause. Their marriage is a
seldomly happy one, with
Louise searching for a mean-
ingful occupation as Reed runs
around the globe following his
convictions and his political
destiny.

Yet some of Reds most
powerful scenes are the ones
that reveal the well-spring of
love that rests underneath this
frantic relationship. The most
memorable of these scenes has

Reed and Louise, after years of
separation, meeting each other
in a crowded Soviet railway sta-
tion. They slowly walk toward
each other through the crowd
and finally join in what is sure
to become one of the film’s most
famous embraces.

Perhaps the finest perfor-
mance in the film is given by
Jack Nicholson, as the brilliant
and cynical playwright Eugene
O’Neill. O’Neill stands in sharp
contrast to the quixotic Reed —
wordly, disillusioned, hardened
by experience. He bitterly
dismisses Reed’s beliefs in a

few slashing sentences. Yet
O’Neill cannot surrender his
love for Louise (he has a short
affair with her before she mar-
ries Reed), or his unspoken ad-
miration for Reed’s depth of

Kolts reported that three loans
totalling $340 are overdue. Kolts
cited problems in collecting the
loans.

“Our basic problem has been
that we've been unable to con-
tact the people who owe us.
Some don’t have phones.”’ Kolts
also explained that- ‘Fancy
Dress is another reason for
problems in collecting the
money this month. People have
been holding out for the big
weekend.”’

Kolts was then asked to ex-
plain the criteria involved in
gaining a loan.

“It has to be a true emergen-
cy — we're not going to pay
your phone bill,” he explained.
“We'll give you money for
food.’’

Kolts also noted that student
transcripts and grades could be
withheld from students owing
money.

Student Activities Board
Treasurer Randall Jacoby

reported to the E.C. that his

organization lost between
$15,000 and $20,000 on Fancy
Dress Weekend. Jacoby added
that after the bills for the Fancy
Dress expenditures come in, the
S.A.B.’s budget should be ‘‘pret-
ty close to zero.”’

Jacoby blamed the financial
loss on the lack of attendance at
Friday night’s ball.

‘Unfortunately, we didn’t get
quite the attendance we ex-
pected,”’ he said. Jacoby added
that the S.A.B. sold approx-
imately 1,400 tickets, way below
the 2,000 it had hoped to sell.

The Executive Committee
also announced the dates for
class elections.

Petitions from the candidates
vying for E.C. and class posi-
tions are due by March 15. Elec-

Generally Speaking:

Why Wasn’t W&L Invited To The Tournament?

by G. Bruce Potter

Some notes, facts and opi-
nions on the recently completed
Washington and Lee basketball
season:

The Generals’ 21-7 record was
better than 18 of the 32 teams in
the N.C.A.A. Division III Tourn-
ament. The tourney field includ-
ed such notables as Bethany
(15-7), whom W&L defeated
early in the season, Buffalo
State (12-15), Ursinus (17-10),
Stanislaus State (15-11) and
Whittier (14-12).

“IT spent three-and-a-half
hours on the phone Sunday
night (Feb. 28) fighting for
Washington and Lee and your
coach,’’ said William P.
Dioguardi, athletic director at
Montclair State (N.J.) and
representative from the South
Atlantic Region to the N.C.A.A.
selection committee. ‘‘I thought
that any school with the number
of wins W&L had, no matter the
schedule, should get in the tour-
nament,”’ he continued.

“I just couldn’t budge them
(the rest of the committee).’”’

There are three conferences
in the South Atlantic region, the
President’s Conference, the
New Jersey Athletic Con-
ference, and the 0.D.A.C. Up-
sala (22-3) received the at-large
bid to the region. Dioguardi ex-
plained that following
Roanoke’s 72-54 defeat of the
Generals in the O.D.A.C. finals,
there would be no_ point
in having the two schools meet
again.

“The other regions all
became very squeamish,” he
continued. “They only wanted
representatives from their
region (as opposed to an at-
large team from across the
country).

“That killed Washington and
Lee.”’

Although
Roanoke, the nation’s number
three ranked, three times, the
Generals also had their shares
of Johnson States, Shenandoahs
and Averetts. In addition, the
0.D.A.C. is not exactly one of
the more feared conferences.

In fact, Roanoke has ad-
vanced further in N.C.A.A. play
this year than any other

they played:

O.D.A.C. school previously. The
Maroons beat Montclair State
and Upsala to win the South
Atlantic Regional and now ad-
vance to the national quarter-
finals against Brooklyn College
this weekend.

The scary thing about that is
this was supposed to be a
rebuilding year for the
Maroons, and they will lose only
one senior, guard Tony Bond.
Other 0.D.A.C. teams to watch
out for next season include
Maryville, which came ex-
tremely close to upsetting W&L
twice and will not lose a starting
player, and Hampden-Sydeny,
which will be very deep.

Of course, W&L Head Coach
Verne Canfield has to be looking
forward to next year, as his
squad loses only two players —
guards George Spears and Ken
Jaffe, a reserve. Who will
replace Spears? The top can-
didates appear to be Henry
Bond, Chris Baldwin, or even
one of the freshmen players,
Lex Fitzhagen, Kevin Mc-
Clatchey andDavid Wilkinson.

The Generals will have the
same set of forwards, John Lee
Graves, Brian Hanson, Jay
Fechtel and Scott Shannon, as
this year, and Jackson Mac-
Farlane will provide an ade-
quate backup to the vastly im-
proved Frank Eppes, although
the 6-8 freshman could do with
putting on a few pounds...

This is the time of year that
selections to the all-whatever
teams are made, so how about
the all-airball team? Of course,
the captain of the squad would
be Roanoke’s David ‘Air Ball’’
Foutz. He shot an air ball when
the Generals downed the
Maroons, 62-61, in Warner
Center, was credited with miss-
ing a dunk later in the season, -
and badly misfired on his only
shot in the 0.D.A.C. final, just
grazing the rim. And he’s only a
sophomore...

And how about the play-of-
the-year for the Generals. Here
are a couple of suggestions. The
first came against Catholic on
Feb. 4, W&L up 70-51 with 2:45
left in the game. Baldwin made

Coach Is Optimistic
About Track Team

by Rick Swagler

Washington and Lee’s track
team opens its 1982 season this
Saturday at Davidson College.
Coach Norris Aldridge says that
his team has more depth in the
distance events yet is still lack-
ing in the field events.

One event that he cannot
worry about is the pole vault.
Vaulter Gene Fellin broke the
school and conference records
last year with a mark of 14 feet.
Aldridge said that Fellin ‘could
add to his pole vault record’’
before the year is over.

Aldridge said he expects
“Kevin Kadesky to break the
100-meter record, Chris Busbee
to break the 400-meter record
and Jon Kelefant could break
the 5,000-meter record.”’

The W&L track team is young
and will rely heavily this year
on the performances of several
freshmen. Despite the youth of
the team, injuries sustained

during the indoor season, and

the adverse weather, Aldridge ~

is optimistic of the season.

“We have some excellent
talents, we'll make a good
showing and probably have a
winning season. The 0.D.A.C.
Championships are here this
year and we could win them if
we keep improving.”

Because the Championships
are at Wilson Field, Aldridge is
hoping for more student sup-
port. ‘‘A lot of the Spring sports
— track, tennis, baseball and
some of our Winter sports —
swimming and wrestling, don’t
get much student support. A lot
of the students probably don’t
know they’re going on. It helps
if they come out and watch our
guys because they work hard.
They’ve put a lot of time into
it...a lot of effort. They’d really
appreciate some _ support,
especially for the O.D.A.C.
meet here on the first of May.”

a steal and raced downcourt. A
Catholic player got in front of
him and although the
sophomore guard could have
taken the ball to the hoop
anyway, he spotted Spears
breaking down the middle and
made a _ perfect over-the
shoulder pass. Spears,
however, had so much momen-
tum that he missed the layup,
but Eppes was right behind him
to tap the ball home and be foul-
ed in the process.

The second came in the
quarterfinal against Eastern
Mennonite. Henry Bond went

Randall compiled a 4-3 record

and six complete games in his
first year with the squad.
Hachenburg finished with.a 4.75
e.r.a. while Brockelman com-
piled a 2-3 record.

Slowing the team’s prepara-
tions for this weekend’s action
was the inclement Lexington
weather. The team was forced
to practice indoors for the last
two weeks as a result of sloppy
field conditions. Murdock
believes, however, that his club
has a chance to practice out-
doors at least twice this week.

As for predicting where the
Generals will finish in league

play, Murdock stated that “‘bar- .

ring any injuries, we should do
o.k.”” Murdock sees Bridge-
water and Lynchburg as the
toughest opposition in the
0.D.A.C., although the league
has no really weak teams this
year.

racing along the sideline after a
loose ball, only to have it hit out
of bounds before he could reach
it. His momentum carried him
right out of the gym, and he
stayed in the hallway for about
15 seconds before returning to
an ovation. He’s so quick that he
probably took a shower and
called his parents during that
time span...

Here’s an interesting fact:
Every time the Generals scored
under 60 points, they lost. And
whenever they scored more
than 67 points, they won.

making predictions, but if the
Washington and Lee lacrosse
team continues to play with the
same determination it showed
in last Saturday’s match with
Navy, the Generals should be
able to keep up with the highly
competitive teams that remain
on the schedule.

The Midshipmen’s potent of-
fense was supposed to be too
much for W&L’s relatively inex-
periencéd defense. The
Generals slowed down the tem-
po, however,: and forced the
game into overtime before los-
ing 11-10.

Head coach Jack Emmer was
very satisfied with what he saw
in the Generals’ first, home
game of the season. “I’m pleas-
ed with the overall effort and
particularly, the mental
preparation that was evident.
We were aggressive and men-
tally sharp. It proved that we
can play on the high level of a
team like Navy.”’

 

Generals Lose to Navy in O.T.
But Hand Lafayette 15-4 Loss

The game looked like it might
become a rout when Navy
scored two quick goals in the
opening minutes. But the
Generals started to get ag-
gressive on defense after John
Sancilio put W&L on the board
by spinning off one. man and
getting free for a shot directly
in front of the Navy goal.

The tight W&L defense forced
the Middies to wait on offense
and prevented them, from at-
tacking the goal consistently,
Navy’s usual style. By the end
of the first half, the Generals
had fashioned a 7-6 lead and ap-
peared capable of pulling off an
upset.

The bulk of W&L’s offense in
the first half was provided by
Lee Heimert, who came
through with three goals, and
Rob Staugaitis, who directed

the attack from behind the net
and assisted on two of
Heimert’s goals. Freshman

_ Mark Knobloch and attackman

Mike Lewers also notched their
first scores of the season.
Emmer was _ particularly
pleased with the work of
Heimert, who added a fourth
goal in the final quarter, and
goaltender Ware Palmer, ‘Lee
was our brightest star out there,
and Ware played well in goal

3 ~and intercepted some key

passes,”’ he said.

Navy regained the lead at 9-7
by shutting out the Generals in
the third quarter while netting
three goals of its own. On the
eighth Navy score, Rob Bianchi
was allowed to come from
behind the W&L goal and beat
Palmer uncontested.

The Generals continued to put

pressure on the Middie defense
but found that goalie Scott Bart-
kowski was equal to the test.
Said Emmer, “We peppered
their goal but couldn’t get it by
him.”’

After a Washington and Lee
timeout with two-and-a-half
minutes left, Heimert took a
pass from Staugaitis and flip-
ped it over Bartkowski’s
shoulder to cut the lead to one.
Then, with time running out,
Sancilio picked up a loose ball
at midfield and split the Navy
defense as he rushed straight
for the goal. Sancilio beat Bar-
tkowski with just 22 seconds
Showing.

Navy took the opening faceoff
of overtime and held the ball for
almost a minute before Mike
Ray beat Palmer with a low
shot from ten yards out.

N.C. State will be the next op-
ponent for the Generals on
Saturday.

“State is as explosive as
anybody in the country, a run
and gun team,” said Emmer.
The coach added that the
Wolfpack returns almost
everyone from last year.

Starting time for the match is
2:00 p.m. on Wilson Field. In the
event of wet grounds, the game
could be moved to Glen Maury
Park in Buena Vista.

That was exactly what hap-
pened yesterday as the
Generals crushed Lafayette
College i5-4 at Glen Maury. The
victory improved W&L’s record
to 2-1, while the Leopards were
playing their opening game.

John Sancilio led the
Generals’ attack with three
goals. Rob Carpenter and Joe
Seifert added two goals apiece.

W&L led all the way after
building a 7-1 lead in the first
quarter. Lafayette did not even
get a shot on goal until eight
minutes of the game had been
completed.

SAB Explains Fancy Dress Losses At EC Session

by J.R. Smith

A large turnout of candidates
for class offices turned in peti-
tions and the Student Activities
Board gave more details on its
post-Fancy Dress financial
position at the Executive Com-
mittee’s meeting Monday night.

44 students turned in petitions
for running for the class offices
of president, vice-president,
and E.C. representative in the
meeting.

Voting Regulation Board
chairman Mike Singer read the
voting rules to the candidates.
The regulations include a $16
spending limit, only ten posters
on campus at any one time, and
use of only one large banner per
candidate. Freshmen posters
are to be limited to the
freshman dorms and Evans
Dining Hall.

The election will be held
Mon., March 22, with run-offs
set for Thurs., March 25. Three
proposed amendments to the
student constitution are to be
voted on in the Monday election,
and polls for the referendum
will be open Tuesday and
Wednesday also.

S.A.B. co-chairman John
Martin and treasurer Randall
Jacoby submitted a financial
report, estimating the total loss
from Fancy Dress at $22,000.
The S.A.B., however, has close
to $20,000 left in its spring
budget, which, applied to the
deficit, would result in a debt of
around $2,000, according to
Jacoby.

E.C. President Eric Myers
asked about the status of the
Tuesday entertainment pro-
grams in the Cockpit. S.A.B.
member Bob Schmidt replied
that ‘Tuesdays in the Pit”
would be cancelled after this
week’s performance by The
Motive, but he pointed out that
self-sufficient events such as
performances by Skip Castro
and The Nighthawks are plan-
ned for the first week in the spr-
ing term.

Martin added that the S.A.B.
is placing ‘‘sort of a freeze on
funds” until all debts are
recovered.

Jacoby disagreed with the
idea of using self-sufficient
entertainment in the spring.
“The best thing to do,”’ he said,
“is to cut out all activities,
because I think it’s our fault and
we have to pay for it.”

E.C. member Tripp Brower
countered, ‘‘You have to take
into account those people who
chose not to go to Fancy Dress.
They expect something for their
money in the spring. It’s not fair
to these people.’’

Martin also had an answer for
Jacoby. “Entertainment must
go on, Randall,’ he said.
“There are other organizations
ahead of their budgets which
could help us out. Hall (Vet-
terlein, I.F.C. President) has
expressed some interest in help-
ing us with an outside concert in
the spring.”’

“Let’s go ahead and have
what we've planned,” E.C.
Secretary Bennett Ross inter-
jected. “You have a respon-
sibility to the students, and the
E.C. has a responsibility to help
you with it,’’ he added.

The S.A.B. members gave
several reasons for the $22,000
loss.

Martin cited the near-$6,000
bill from Buildings and Grounds
and the Athletic Department for
decoration and clean-up as a
problem.

‘“‘We had only two days to
decorate the gym — not a week,
as we were told we would have
last year. B&G really killed us
on the overtime. Paying $9.00
an hour to tear down wall paper
is pretty ridiculous,” Martin
said.

Jacoby added that the S.A.B.
had budgeted only $2,000 for
payment to Buildings and
Grounds.

Martin defended the use of a
professional to decorate
Warner Center.

“There was no way not to use
professionals to fix that gym in
two days,” he said. The S.A.B.
paid $6,475 for the professional
decorator’s services.

But Jacoby disagreed. ‘I
think it’s ridiculous to spend so
much on that,” he argued.

Martin also mentioned the
various decorations bought this
year which could be used for
future events, adding that these
costs would not be a problem
next year.

The ceiling used in Doremus
Gymnasium, which cost the
S.A.B. $3,245, can be used next
year, as can the $164 arbour,
$500 worth of cloth used in the
old gym, and the pictures which
were on display, which cost
$1181, according to Martin.

Low ticket sales were also a
problem, according. to both
Martin and Jacoby. Jacoby
reported that only 80 to 90 law
students bought _ tickets.
Schmidt said he felt the debt
would have been lower if facul-
ty and administration members
had been asked to pay their
way. '

Martin added, ‘‘if we had sold
2,000 tickets, it would be a dif-
ferent story here.

The S.A.B., following a talk
with the administration, had ex-
pected to sell around 2,000

tickets. ‘‘With that in mind, we
were thinking more toward sell-
ing 3,000 tickets, with the alum-
ni coming this year,’ Martin
added.

E.C. Law _ Representative
Morgan Griffith asked Martin if
a Thursday night concert
should be held next year.

“‘T liked the concert because it
gave the townspeople some-
thing to do,’” Martin answered.
Schmidt added that the S.A.B.
should have the concert next
year, but it should be smaller
and more self-sufficient.

E.C. representative Ben Hale
asked if there were problems
with members who did not con-
tribute their time to the
preparations for the ball.

“We didn’t do that much,”
answered Jacoby. ‘‘I think part
of the problem is that we didn’t
do things by ourselves.”’

Martin stated that all
members were signed up for
various jobs, but that some of
the people neglected to work.

Schmidt offered the option of
a mid-year review of the
members of the committee.

When all discussion was
finished, Myers gave his opi-
nion of the production. ‘‘I think
the figures were reasonable, I
think you played a good game,
and I think it worked out,” he
said.

Martin also had a statement
to make.

‘“‘We feel it was our deal to
pull off. I feel that next year, it’s
not going to be the problem it
was this year. I was talking to
Dean (Lewis) John after the
ball, and he said the money I
told him we were going to lose is
just the price we have to pay to
show we can make the gym
elegant,’’ Martin said.

Schmidt added, ‘‘We had
something special for the 75th
anniversary, and I think that, to
have a $67,000 show when we
started with only $20,000, to end
up only $2,000 in debt is pretty
good.””

Morgan Griffith moved that
the E.C. congratulate the S.A.B.
on the production of this year’s
Fancy Dress. The motion pass-
ed 10-1, with junior represen-
tative Frank Smith opposing.

Centel Cooperative
In other action, the E.C.
heard reports from its subcom-
mittees on a new student
telephone union, and from Con-
tact. The Centel cooperative
subcommittee submitted its in-
itial proposal concerning waiv-
ing phone deposit requirements

for W&L students.

SAB Kicked Out Of duPont
After Skin Flick Complaints

by Todd Smith

“‘We want sex, we want sex,”
cried students Saturday night
as they pounded on the doors of
duPont auditorium. They were
30 minutes early for the 11 p.m.
showing of an X-rated movie by
the Student Activities Board,
while inside “My Fair Lady”
was showing.

Complaints about this, and
the physical abuse of the
auditorium during the showing
of the skin-flick, led Dr. Al Gor-
don, head of the fine arts
department, to ban future SAB
films from duPont.

“They were screaming and
hollering and banging on the
door,’’ said Chris Peacock, the
projectionist for ‘My. Fair
Lady.”” He said that when
another SAB worker asked
them to quiet down, they just
got louder.

Gordon found duPont
auditorium abused when he
came to work Monday morning.

“They had burned cigarette
holes in the carpet and squirted
beer on the stage and screen,”
and he found four desk-tops
pulled from the lecture hall’s
seats.

According to Gordon, the aud-
titorium was remodeled and
carpeted in September for ex-
panded use. He worried about
the showing of X-rated movies
‘not because it was porno, but
because it generally attracts an
audience that is very hard to
control.”

“I think when students go toa
movie they ought to be able to
relax and enjoy themselves, to
take in food and drinks,” said
Gordon. “I just have to insist
that it not be in this room.”

This week’s SAB film will pro-
bably be shown in the law
school, according to Randall

“Jacoby, treasurer of the SAB.
_He said that some films may
_wind up being presented in Stu-

dent Center rooms 112 and 113.

Jacoby denies that more than
one desk was damaged during
the showings.

The SAB was investigating
the possibility of removing
sound equipment from the
auditorium which it claims it
purchased, board members
Said.

John Martin, co-chairman of
the SAB, said that members
had been cleaning up _ the
auditorium after use, and
removing bottles and trash.

Gordon, however, said that
the room was ‘“‘a mess’ on
Saturday, and that the SAB had
to be called to clean it up for a
recital.

“I think the students were
comfortable with going to du-
Pont for movies and trashing
it,” said Assistant Dean Mike
Cappeto, who works with the
SAB. “That was never a pro-
blem until it was remodeled.”

W&L’s baseball team opened
its season on a promising note
with two routs of West Virginia
Tech and an extra inning loss to
Division II power California
State (Pa.).

Before this weekend’s games
the pitching staff had been a bit
of a question mark. But, seniors
Rich Hachenberg and David
Randall and freshman Billy
White all turned in superb per-
formances in starting roles last
weekend.

Coach Jim Murdock expected
the strong performances from
his seniors, but he was extreme-
ly pleased by White’s strong
performance in his first col-
legiate game.

In Friday’s game, West
Virginia Tech jumped out to an
early 1-0 lead, but W&L

responded with a_ three-run
third and a single run in the 4th.
Dave Warrenfeltz slammed a
homer to rightfield to highlight
the rally.

After Tech had scored a run
in the top of the 8th to narrow
the lead to 4-2, W&L responded
with eight runs in the bottom
half. :

The Generals mixed some
key hits with a few Tech errors
and a lot of walks. Mark
McLaughlin cracked two
doubles in the inning as the
Generals built a 12-2 lead.

Hachenberg finished off Tech
in the ninth to pick up his first
win of the new season. Hachen-
berg allowed only four hits and
three walks.

Saturday’s rematch with
West Virginia Tech followed the
same pattern as Friday’s game.
Tech jumped out to a 1-0 lead off
David Randall before W&L re-
bounded for a 9-1 win.

“It took us a little while to get
the bats going again,”’ noted
Murdock.

At the plate, junior Tim Daly

provided the real fireworks
though.

Ellis ripped a bases-loaded
triple and then scored on the

W&L Tennis

Has Tough
Weekend

by David Stuart

The score was 6-7, 6-3, 6-6, and
Washington and Lee freshman
Andy Haring trailed the 12-point
tiebreaker 6-5. After a
short rally, Haring’s backhand
went long to end the match.

It was a sudden finish to a
grueling see-saw duel and a
turning point in the tennis
match Sunday against the
University of Charleston on the
W&L courts.

Three tiebreaker losses and
the absence of No. 2 player Wes
Yonge were factors in the 6-3
loss. Sophomore Jim Irwin (No.
4 singles) was shaken 6-7, 0-6
and freshman Stephen Bend-
heim suffered a 3-6, 6-7 defeat.

Yonge, the veteran senior,
was sick with the flu and missed
three matches. Junior varsity
coach Howard Ainsley, substi-
tuting for an absent Gary
Franke, said, ‘“‘The tiebreakers
definitely hurt us.”’

Despite a tough weekend with
three losses to California State
(9-0), the University of
Rochester (9-0), and the
University of Charleston (6-3),
Franke is not discouraged.

“I’m not concerned so much
with our won-loss record during
the season, as compared to the
O.D.A.C. Tournament and

Randall pitched a complete
game in picking up the win. He
allowed seven hits and no walks
while fanning twelve batters.

Sunday’s contest with Califor-
nia State (Pa.) was a pitcher’s
duel from the start.

W&L freshman Bill White
kept Cal State hitless through
three innings. After nine the
game was even at 1-1, but Cal
State scored twice in the top of
the 10th and stopped a General
rally to win, 3-2.

In the fifth, senior Jeff Hag-
gerty walked, stole second, and
moved to third on a throwing er-

ror. He scored on a single by
sophomore Mike Walsh, giving
W&La 1-0 lead.

White worked his way out of
trouble many times until finally
yielding the tying run in the 9th.
The Cal State runner scored
from second on a wild pitch and
a throwing error.

In the 10th, Cal State scored
two unearned runs off senior
Jim Brockelman and held the
Generals to only one. The lone
W&L run came across on a Jim
Daly double and a sacrifice fly
by Dave Warrenfeltz.

Freshman Busbee Paces
Track To 76-68 Victory

Freshman Chris Busbee cap-
tured two individual events and
participated on two winning
relay teams to pace the
Washington and Lee_ track
squad to a 76-68 victory over
Davidson College on Saturday.

Times of 23.645 seconds in the
200-meter race and 52.33
seconds in the 400-meter event
enabled Busbee to win both. He
combined with classmates
Chris Ives and Scott Henderson
and sophomore Kevin Kadesky
to win the 440-relay in 44.83
seconds and with Pembroke,

Paul Chapman, and Martin
Pruitt to take the milerelay ina
time of 3:31.40.

The Generals’ strength in the
running events was evident as
they claimed six of ten running
competitions and placed at
least second in those that they
didn’t win. However, the squad
only won two of seven field
events.

Sophomore Charlie Alcorn led
a trio of three Generals who
earned points in the discus

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

The SAB (Cont’d)

The great debate over the Fancy Dress overruns
continued last week, only this time there was fighting
among members of the S.A.B. troupe.

At Monday night’s Executive Committee meeting,
S.A.B. Treasurer Randall Jacoby and his boss,
S.A..B. Co-chairman John Martin, clearly had
disagreements over how the board should be run for
the remainder of the year. Jacoby seems to want to
run the S.A.B. under tight fiscal policy, while Martin
believes that the campus is hungry for entertainment.

To its credit, the E.C. did not take this infighting as
a sign of weakness on the S.A.B.’s part. Rather than
nitpicking over the various cost overruns, the E.C.
seemed more concerned with the status of campus
entertainment for the rest of the year.

Perhaps the most profound point was raised by
Senior Representative Tripp Brower, who questioned
the fairness of denying entertainment to students who
did not attend the ball. Martin. seemed to have the
best solution to this problem when he speculated that
the S.A.B. might be able to go in on a concert with an
organization that is ahead of its budget.

We see the purpose of the S.A.B. as that of providing
entertainment to the campus. When the funds run
dry, the S.A.B. should not retire into a shell, but
should actively seek other ways to stage concerts.
John Martin made this point clear at Monday night’s
meeting. We think he is right.

Students Win Business Games

A team of students from
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics won top
honors in the 1982 Inter-
collegiate Business Games in
Atlanta, Ga., last month.

Washington and Lee’s team
was composed of Andy Gott-
schalk of Lake Forest, IIl.,;
John Monroe of New Orleans,
La.; Brian Noonan of Charlotte,
N.C.; and, Bob Wittpenn of Glen
Ridge, N.J. All are seniors.

Dr. Joseph Goldsten, pro-
fessor of administration at
W&L, served as faculty adviser
to the team.

The Intercollegiate Business
Games are sponsored annually
by the Graduate Business
Association of the Graduate
School of Business Administra-
tion at Emory University in
Atlanta.

Washington and Lee was one
of 24 colleges and universities
participating in the games

which began in early January
when the W&L team took over a
hypothetical firm and attempt-
ed to improve that firm’s pro-
fitability.

“We became the manage-
ment of a firm we called ‘Lee
Labs.’ Our firm produced
aspirin and an aspirin product
with codeine,” Wittpenn ex-
plained.

“Our task in the games was to
take this hypothetical company,
which had been standing still
because of poor management,
and create, then implement, a
strategy that would turn that
company around.”

By using a computer terminal
on the W&L campus that was
tied directly into a central com-
puter at Emory, the W&L team
made a series of decisions each
week as it guided the company
through three years of its
development in two months

tima

“In establishing our strategy,
we had to take numerous
variables into consideration, in-
cluding the current business
climate and forecasts of the
future economic _ situation,”
said Monroe.

After all the weekly decisions
had been made and Lee Labs
was thriving, the W&L team
joined its competitors for two
final days of competition in
Atlanta where all the teams
were required to make presen-
tations before panels of judges.
The judges included members
of the Emory faculty, graduate
business students at Emory,
and representatives of industry.
*“The competition held in
Atlanta was about 50 percent of
the entire game,” explained

Wittpenn. “It was a real
pressure-cooker.
The championship was

the competition. W&L’s team

Born in New York City and
educated in public schools
there, Wald received a bachelor
of sciences degree from New
York University in 1927 and
earned a Ph.D. degree in 1932
from Columbia University,
where he was a student and
research assistant of Professor
Selig Hecht.

Awarded a National Re-
search Council Fellowship in
Biology in 1932, he began the
fellowship in the laboratory of
Otto Warburg in Berlin-
Dahlem. That is where Wald
first identified Vitamin A in the
retina. Vitamin A had, at the
time, been isolated in the
laboratory of Paul Karrer in

 

Biologist Wald Talks Tonight

Zurich where Wald completed
the identification. He also work-
ed in the laboratory of Otto
Meyerhoff at the Kaiser
Wilhelm Institute in
Heidelberg, where he
discovered retinal (Vitamin A
aldehyde), a component of the
visual cycle.

Wald went to Harvard in the
fall of 1934 as a tutor in
biochemical sciences. He has
been there ever since: as an in-
structor and tutor in biology
(1935-44), associate professor
(1944-48), and professor (1948-).
He received the Higgins Chair
in Biology in 1968 and was nam-

George Wald

(continued from page 7)
emeritus in 1977.

Having retired from
teaching, Wald currently
“divides his time between what
he thinks of as his outer and in-
ner lives: mostly the outer,
spent trying to keep the human
species from self-extinction;
and in time spared from that,
trying to come to terms with the
realm of consciousness, beyond
space and time.”’

Wald has received numerous
prizes and awards from a varie-
ty of fields, including biochem-
istry, ophthamology and optics.
In 1953, he received the
Lasker Award of the American
Public Health Association ‘“‘in
recognition of his outstanding
discoveries in biochemistry
with special reference to the

 

changes associated with vision
and the function of Vitamin A.”’

In 1967, Wald was awarded
the Paul Karrer Medal of the
University of Zurich jointly
with his wife, Ruth Hubbard. In
that same year, he shared the
Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine with Drs. Hartlin and
Granit.

Wald was elected to the Na-
tional Academy of Science in
1950 and to the American
Philosophical Sooiety in 1958.
He is a fellow of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences
in Boston and the Optical Socie-
ty of America. In 1963-64, he
was a Guggenheim Fellow,
Philosophical Society in 1958.
He is a fellow of the American
elected an Overseas Fellow of
Churchill College.

Investigators Examining

LPD Role In Theft Ring

Four Lexington policeman and a Rockbridge
County deputy were suspended from duty yester-
day in the latest development in the probe of a
local theft ring that allegedly involves past and
present members of the Lexington Police Depart-
ment.

Yesterday, Lexington Police Chief James A.
Kirby suspended the following officers from his
squad: Lt. W.F. “‘Bill’’ Knick, Lt. J.K. ‘‘Joe’’ Col-
bert, Officer T.H. ‘‘Tony’ Clark, and Officer
Donald E. Stubblefield. Kirby said that the of-
ficers were suspended from the police force ‘‘pen-
ding the completion of (the) investigation.”

In addition to the four Lexington police officers,
Lt. Carl H. Emore of the Rockbridge County
Sheriff’s Department was also suspended from his
duties. Emore is a two-and-a-half year veteran of
the department.

With yesterday’s suspensions, the number of
past and present officers now being investigated
totals 10. The list includes Knick, Colbert, Stub-
blefield, Clark, Elmore, and Hamilton. Also in-
cluded on the list is Barry Flint, whose statements
to investigators revealed the theft ring. Jack Pur-
vis, a ten-year veteran of the L.P.D. who retired in
1980, is also on the list.

An article in this morning’s Roanoke Times &
World News said that in addition to the policemen
suspended yesterday, investigators are looking at
two more former Lexington police officers, one of
whom is working in a nearby law jurisdiction.

Of the five officers suspended yesterday, Knick
had the longest amount of service, having worked
for the L.P.D. since 1949. Of the remaining of-
ficers, the length of duty ranges from two to ten
years.

’ The disclosures of the theft ring began last week
when Flint agreed to accept immunity from fur-
ther charges in exchange for cooperating with in-
vestigators. Flint had been found guilty of stealing
$280 from Hop-In in 1977. Flint’s statement was
taken by state police investigators, but Com-
monwealth’s Attorney Beverly C. ‘John’ Read
asked for additional investigators on Tuesday.

The Times & World News also reported this
morning that Read would ask that a grand jury be
reconvened to consider the charges in the in-
vestigation.

How It All Began

by Bill France
On March 15, Barry Flint. 32. an ex-Lexington
policeman, began to cooperate with state in-
vestigators after being granted immunity to fur.
ther allegations of a police theft ring in Léxington.

Earlier that day, Flint had been given a three-
year suspended sentence after pleading guilty to

the theft of $280 from the Hop-In convenience store —

in 1977.

Commonwealth Attorney Beverly C. ‘John’
Read said that he recommended a jail sentence
for Flint to. Lexington Circuit Court Judge
Rudolph Bumgardner. Read also said there was
no plea bargaining involved. Read said Bumgard-
ner justified the sentence by sighting that it was
Flint’s first offense.

Although an undisclosed number of past and
present Lexington policeman are being _in-
vestigated in connection with theft ring allega-
tions, a Roanoke paper quoted Read as saying
“Lexington’s got one of the finest police depart-
ments there is.”’ Since the time Read made that
comment, five past and present officers have been
suspended from police duties pending investiga-
tion of the theft ring.

Read called in state police investigators in
November after hearing about an internal police
department investigation of the Hop-In theft from
a reporter. Until then, the matter had been con-
cealed by the police department.

Flint resigned when the state investigators were
called into the case. His lack of cooperation with
the state police brought an end, at that time, to the
investigation.

A Virginia State Police Trooper was suspended from duty Tues-
day in connection with the Rockbridge County Commonwealth At-
torney’s investigation of the Lexington Police Department.

State Trooper Marvin Hamilton was suspended from duty Tues-
day pending further investigation.

Hamilton had been a Lexington police officer for eight years
prior to his service with the State Police.

On Monday afternoon, Lexington Police Chief James A. Kirby
met with four state police investigators and Commonwealth At-
torney Beverly C. “John” Read.

Read said the conference was held to inform Kirby of the latest
developments on the investigation of allegations that a theft ring
has been operating out of the Lexington Police Department for
several years.

Read said Kirby was ‘‘provided with substantial inforamtion at
the time state police investigators met with him yesterday.”

Read said that the State Police had been provided with the same
type of information given to Kirby, and that based on information
given to the state police, Hamilton was suspended.

“TI cannot comment as to why Kirby did not do the same,’
Read.

Reading from a prepared statement, Kirby said Tuesday that he
has “requested the Commonwealth’s Attorney to furnish me
evidence to support any allegations by Lexington police offiecers.
As of this time, I have not received the evidence.

“If and when I receive sufficient evidence to support the allega-
tions being made, I will take prompt and firm action in accordance
with the law,”’ said Kirby.

Kirby indicated that the information provided to him by the in-
vestgators did not warrant suspension of Lexington police officers.

Read also said that additional state police officers had been
brought in to help with the investigation on Tuesday.

“This theft ring, operating out of the Lexington Police Depart-
ment, has been going on for years,” said Read. He pointed out that
he did not learn of the allegations until last week.

Read said the additional investigators are needed to bring the in-
vestigation to an ‘‘expeditious”’ termination.

The investigation began with indormation given to the State
Police by former Lexington police officer Barry Flint.

On March 15, Flint pleaded guilty to the theft of $280 from the
Hop-In store on N. Main St. in June, 1977.

Circuit Court Judge Rudolph Bumgardner sentenced Flint to a’
three-year suspended sentence and placed him on probation. The
terms of Flint’s probation have not yet been determined by the
court,

Flint was interviewed for two hours by state police investigators
immediately after the trial.

Ford Defends Reagan In Macon Speech

by John Wells

Former President Gerald R.
Ford expressed general support
for the policies of the Reagan
administration during remarks
in Lynchburg on Tuesday.

The ex-president met with
reporters while visiting Ran-
dolph Macon Woman’s College
for a day of speeches and ap-
pearances.

Ford said President Reagan
should stand firm on his budget
and tax cut proposals, which he
said would lead to an eventual
economic recovery.

“For the president to
capitulate to short-term
political gain would be bad for
the economy,” Ford said ‘“‘What
we’re going through now is the

 

Former President Gerald R.
Ford at R-MWC.

 

Ford said the success of GOP
candidates this fall would be
tied to the economy, but he feels
that a certain economic upturn
will be advantageous.

The former president sug-
gested the huge projected
budget deficit could be reduced
by cutting the growth of defense
spending.

“I’m a hawk, always have
been, and I’m proud of it,’”’ Ford
reminded the gathering of
reporters. He said Reagan can
“spread out defense  pro-
curements’’ to “‘slow down the
cash outflow.” He predicted
such a move would arouse
squawks from the Pentagon,
which he termed ‘“hogwash.”’

build-up, said Ford, without en-
dangering the national defense.

Ford also supports his suc-
cessor’s Central American
policy and said he opposes a
negotiated settlement of the
conflict in El Salvador. Such
negotiations, he said, only serve
to invite the Soviet Union into
the hemishpere.

The former president said he
sees no reason to compare the
situation in El Salvador to U.S.
involvement in Vietnam. He
reeled off statistics of
geography and population tc
support his contention.

Asked about the Middle East
Ford said he supports the con-
clusion of the Camp David Ac-

further negotiations between
Israel and moderate Arab na-

tions.’’ No comphrehensive set-
tlement will be
reached at any single

negotiating table, he said.

Ford virtually acknowledged
the frequent charge that the
Reagan administration has no
Middle East policy by saying ‘‘I
hope they’1l come up.with one.”’

The 38th president looked tan-
ned and relaxed, as the cliche
goes, in a black and white plaid
suit. He fielded questions easily
and answered questions ade-
quately and, for the most part,
predictably.

He said the proposal by Soviet

26 Candidates Compete In Run-Off Today

by J.R. Smith

Only one campus position was
won in this week’s elections, but
26 candidates fared well enough
to make Thursday’s run-off
vote, the Executive Committee
announced in its meeting Mon-
day night.

Jeff Londrey won the election
for Senior vice-president of the
science majors, by only a three
vote margin. Of course,
only 15 votes were counted from
science majors. Score: Jeff
Londrey - 9, Bob Marshall - 6.

In the senior class elections
for E.C. representative, Pete
Baumgaertner, Jeff Bebee,
John Vlahoplus, and John But-
tarazzi all received enough
votes to make the run-off elec-
tion. Vlahoplus received 105
votes, Baumgaertner took 58,
Buttarazzi received 53 votes,
Bebee took 49, and Craig Ar-
mantrout Conn, who did not
make the run-off had 35 votes.

In the race for president of
the Class of 1983, Eric Nelson
and Chris Stokes received 78
and 61 votes respectively to
make the run-off election. Mike
Drinkwater received 30 votes.

The election for vice-presi-
dent-Arts for the senior class
also produced a run-off. Jim
Baldwin received 14 votes and
Ralph Paris took 11 to make it
to Thursday’s election. Ty
Lawson, who did not make the
cut, received 5 votes.

Jack Sharman received 12
votes and Jay Windsor got 17 to
get their chances in the run-off
election for senior vice-presi-
dent-Commerce. Brad Vaughan
missed the run-off by one vote.
He received 11 votes.

In the Class of 1984 elections,
four students received enough
votes in the race for E.C.
Representative to campaign for
the Thursday vote.

Ted McQuiston received 52
votes, Scott Mason received 36
votes, barely edging Peter Col-
lins, who received 35 votes, and

Jack O’Brien took 26 votes.
“These candidates will be in the

run-off election.
Leighton Stradtman and John

McCants both received 24 votes
in their E.C. candidacy, fol-
lowed by Markham Pyle with
17, Jeff Wells with 15, and
Emory Edwards with eight’
votes.

In the election for president of
the junior class, Bob Jenevein
took 56 votes and Parker
Schenecker took 43 votes to
become eligible for the run-off
vote. Leonard Howard received
23 votes.

The race for junior class vice-
president was very tight, and
placed two candidates in the
run-off election. Ben St. Clair
edged out Charlie Alcorn 49
votes to 45, but both are cand-
idates in Thursday’s election.
Jet Taylor received 27 votes.

The sophomore class elec-
tions were also very tight. In the
E.C. Representative election,
Darby Brower received 166
votes, Dave Johnson received
138 votes, Cole Dawson received
121 votes, and Roger Day took
31 votes. Each of the above
candidates will be on the ballot
in the run-off election. George
Kinkead took 27 votes, but dia
not make the run-off.

The election for President of
next year’s sophomores pro-
duced two run-off candidates.
Kevin Kelley received 123
votes, and Sam Dalton received
71 votes to make Thursday’s
election. Charles Davidson, who
was defeated, received 60 votes.

The race for sophomore class
vice-president cut the field from
five candidates to two. Robert
Tomaso and Bill Brown re-
ceived 96 and 57 votes respec-
tively to make the run-off. They
defeated Gordon Ogden (45
votes), Mare Monyek (42
votes), and Tom Pearce (14
votes).

The races for the three vice-
president positions in the senior

class ran into a few problems as
the vote was counted. Accord-
ing to E.C. secretary Bennett
Ross, about 25 ballots were
thrown out because students
circled more than one cand-
idate.

Sophomore representative
Ben Hale pointed out that the
ballots were disqualified after
students chose to pick can-
didates for each vice-presi-
dency beacuse of confusion over
the rules. Voters were allowed
to vote only for the candidates
in the area of their majors. Hale
added that the sign explaining
this fact was not in clear view,
and there was no explanation on
the ballot. Students double ma-
joring in two of the areas who
wished to cast two votes also

caused confusion. Double ma- °

jors may vote for only one can-
didate.

Second-year law _ represen-
tative Morgan Griffith showed
his concern over the election
saying the E.C. had to do
something about the problem of
confusion in this election.
“More votes were disqualified
in this election than any one
candidate _ received,’’ he
stressed.

At this point in the delibera-
tion, the committee seemed
ready to call for a new election,
but no one made the motion. In-
stead, the E.C. opted to run a re-
count of all the ballots in the
senior vice-president race, with
all double votes to be thrown
out.

In other action, the Executive
Committee heard reports from
the W&L Film Society, Ariel,
the Publications Board, the In-
ternational Club, and the E.C.
moved to freeze all funds to the
Calyx until its staff contacted
the E.C. The Calyx was to be
represented at the meeting, but
none of the staff showed up.

Film Society President
Russell Clarke reported that the
Polish film, ‘‘“Man of Marble,”’

Students ina Washington and
Lee University journalism class
had a chance to test their skills
in television production on a
major scale last week when
Cable Channel Nine, W&L’s
student-operated television sta-
tion, presented a live telecast of
the NCAA Division III Swim-
ming and Diving Champion-
ships.

The three-day NCAA event,
which involved more than 375
competitors from 75 different
Division III colleges and univer-
sities, was held in Washington
and Lee’s Twombly Pool.

Cable Channel Nine, which
ordinarily provides three hours
of daily programming, carried
18 hours of live coverage during
the meet and produced a nightly
highlights program.

“This event provided in-
valuable experience for our
students,’’ said Robert J. de
Maria, assistant professor of
journalism at Washington and

For the past month, the
Letitia Pate Evans Dining Hall
was in violation of a Lexington
fire code. The dining hall has
six exits, and of these exits, only
three are marked.

Each night between 6:30 p.m.
and 6:45 p.m., four of these ex-
its were locked even though
sometimes 40 or 50 students
were still eating. In itself, this is
neither a safety hazard nor a
violation.

According to Leonard Reiss,
City Building Inspector for.the
City of Lexington, ‘Even forty
or fifty people would be no pro-
blem. Just two of those doors
could handle 300 people.”

The violation was that of the
four doors that were locked, two
were marked as exits. Reiss
stated that “as long as the
building is occupied — even if
it’s just one person — you can’t
lock a marked exit.”

Reiss added that the dining
hall ‘‘wouldn’t have a smoke
problem because of the high
ceilings. There is almost no
chance that a flash fire could
catch anybody.”

size created situations that
caused the students to display a
lot of originality in their ap-
proach.

“In addition to normal Cable
Channel Nine staff members,
students in Journalism 232
(Television Production) were
involved in the overall produc-
tion.”

W&L’s Cable Channel Nine is
seen on the Lexington cable

system. In addition, a closed.

circuit system was created
within the university’s Warner
Center, allowing competitors to
watch the proceedings on a big
screen television several floors
above the Twombly Pool.

“Having the telecast
available helped us relieve the
congestion around the pool with
the enormous number of com-
petitors we had,” said W&L
swimming coach Page Remil-

exit sign is covered or a promi-

warning that it is locked.

take care of it. This was in keep-

ESPN, a national cable station
specializing in sports program-
ming, and WVPT, the public
television station in Harrison-
burg, Va., had originally ex-
pressed interest in telecasting

the swimming event.
“When both of those
possibilities failed to

materialize, we decided to
tackle it,” said de Maria. ‘‘It re-
quired a lot of technical exper-
tise in adition to a lot of
hours.”

Rush Study Favored

by Scott Mason

Newly-elected  Inter-
fraternity Council Vice Presi-
dent Steve Jones said that he
favors further study into a
delayed Rush system as part of
his recently acquired duties.

Jones said that it is “very im-
portant to look into the delayed
Rush matter further.” Jones
said that he feels the Rush
system is fine as is, although a
lengthy study into possible
changes of the system may
result in previously overlooked
benefits.

Swimmers Finish 9th; Lax Drubs N.C. St.

400-Free Relayers,
Bernot Lead W&L

by Andrew P. Hoppes

Washington and Lee’s 400-yard freestyle relay
team kicked to a fourth-place finish to help the
Generals earn a ninth-place team finish in last
weekend’s NCAA Division III Swimming and Div-
ing Championships in Lexington.

The ninth-place finish, the highest for the
Generals since another ninth in 1977, exceeded the
pre-tournament predictions of Coach Page
Remillard and his staff. W&L compiled 51 points,
one more than 10th-place Allegheny.

Individually, senior Mike Bernot placed second
in both the 50-yard freestyle and 100-yard freestyle
races to add two more All-American honors to his
previous five. Bernot missed another All-
American honor by finishing 13th in the 200-yard
freestyle. The top 12 finishers earn All-American
Honors.

Preventing Bernot from joining John Hudson as
W&L’s only champion in an NCAA swimming
event was William Patterson College’s Joseph
Gentile. Gentile, whose qualifying time in the 50-

yard freestyle was the fourth-fastest in the entire —

nation, swam to victories in the 50, 100, and 200-
yard freestyles.

In the 100-yard freestyle preliminaries, Bernot
swam a 45.96 to set a new Division III record. That
record lasted about a minute until Gentile swam a
45.75 in the next heat.

A second W&L swimmer, junior Rob Crawford,
notched two All-American spots. Crawford fin-
ished 11th in the 100-yard breaststroke and 12th in
the 200-yard breaststroke. These were Crawford’s
first All-American honors.

W&L’s biggest heroes though were the swim-
mers on the 400-yard freestyle team, who ac-
counted for 22 of W&L’s 51 points.

Sophomores Gary Meyer and Rand McClain and
seniors Herb Gresens and Bernot all swam strong-

'Good Ball Control
Key i

in 13-10 Win

by John Harrison

Take away the opposition’s potent offense by
reducing its fast break opportunities. This
strategy has been the same in all the games the
Washington and Lee lacrosse team has played to
date and, judging from the strong schedule that
remains, it could stay that way for the rest of the
season.

But as long as that strategy continues to work,
nobody associated with the team is likely to argue
with it.

Last week the Generals were able to slow down
Navy mainly by controlling the ball and looking
for the good shot. In last Saturday’s 13-10 victory
over North Carolina State, W&L carried out its
plan by keeping the Wolfpack tied up in its own
end when it tried to clear the ball.

The win improved the Generals’ record to 3-1
(prior to yesterday’s game at Delaware). Rob
Staugaitis led W&L with three goals and two
assists, while Lee Heimert contributed three more
goals, including two in the fourth quarter.

Mike Schuler also had three points on a goal and
two assists. W&L goaltender Ware Palmer made
seven saves, the most important coming on a shot
from point blank distance in the closing minutes.

Head coach Jack Emmer said that one factor in
the victory was W&L’s ability to ‘‘ride’’ State. This
involves stealing a clearing pass from the opposi-
tion and knocking the ball loose from the man try-
ing to make the clear.

‘“‘We’re trying to be more aggressive, especially
on defense, than we were last year,’’ noted tri-
captain Mike Schuler. Schuler cited the play of
Newton Kendrick and Mike Pressler as two of the
reasons for the improvement on defense.

Another key was the Generals’ ability to control
faceoffs in spite of the loss of regular midfielder
John Tunney to an injury. Said Emmer, “Rich

Despite Heat, Humidity, NCAA Meet A Success

ee ee

 

by G. Bruce Potter

The NCAA Division III Swim-

‘ ming and Diving Champion-

«ships last weekend. at

Washington and Lee were an

unqualified success, and much

of the credit must go to Page
Remillard.

As well as serving as meet
director, Remillard coached the
W&L team to a ninth place
finish, their best since 1977.
Here are some brief postscripts
to the event:

The NCAA meet was the com-
puter timing system. Who needs
a gun to start a race when you
can use a beep? Of course, that
little beep created great
frustration in the finals of the
1650-yard freestyle event on
Saturday evening as the clock

malfunctioned to cause a 25-
minute delay.

The NCAA meet was the heat
and humidity. Earlier in the
season, Remillard, sitting in the
even-then unpleasant heat of a
nearly-empty pool gallery, said,
‘Can you imagine what the heat
will be like in March when 500
people are up here?” He
couldn’t have come closer to the
truth as the pool gallery was
more like a sauna and pro-
grams were most popularly
used as fans.

The NCAA meet was Doug
Jones and Joseph Gentile.
Jones led Claremont-Mudd to a
fourth-place finish by winning
the 500-yard freestyle, the 100-
yard backstroke and the 200-
yard backstroke and setting na-

tional records in all three. And

he doesn’t even shave his head.
Gentile scored all of William

Patterson’s 48 points by captur-

ing the 50-, 100-, and 200-yard
freestyle races. Gentile
qualified for the 1980 Olympics,
so W&L swimmer Mike Bernot
shouldn’t be too upset at losing
to him by a fraction of a second
in the 50- and 100-yard events.

The NCAA meet was
Remillard himself. Dressed un-
characteristically in a jacket
and tie, the third-year coach
seemed to be all over the place.

final, Remillard was in true
form throughout the weekend.
The NCAA meet was the fans.
They came from all over the
country in groups representing
their team, and the largest con-
tingent seemed to support the
eventual national champion,
Kenyon College of Ohio. But
there were also the yellow-
shirted Allegheny fans and the
girlfriends of nearly every
swimmer present. All the fans
were extremely knowledgeable
and obviously had plenty of ex-
perience at this type of thing, be
it a recreational, high school or
college meet. They came armed
with programs, pencils, pens,
sophisticated stopwatches and
heat sheets, (nothing to do with
the temperature but actually a
listing of swimmers omen

   
       

in a specific event and room to
enter their times).

And, of course, the NCAA
meet was the swimmers. Their
aquatic performances were
quite incredible in themselves,
but their out-of-water actions
typified the spirit of a Division
III event. These included
Allegheny College swimmers
spelling out their school name
along the edge of the pool, the
State University of New York
swimmer leading cheers from
atop the 3-meter diving board,
Kenyon’s David Dininny and
Allegheny’s Daniel Stewart ex-
changing a few words of en-
couragement prior to the 200-
yard individual medley final,
and the applause that every
winner received, especially if
= had set a record.

Baseball Downs VMI

by Andrew P. Hoppes

Washington and Lee’s
baseball team tallied two more
wins recently, including a vic-
tory over V.M.I., to raise its
record to 4-2.

“‘We showed a lot of poise and
confidence,” noted Coach Jim
Murdock in reference to the 7-5
win over Virginia Military.
Murdock also observed that it
was W&L’s first victory over
V.M.I. in several years.

V.M.I. jumped out to a 4-1
lead off eventual winning pit-
cher Dave Randall, but the
Generals. responded with five
runs in the fifth. Four walks, a
sacrifice fly by Mike Walsh, and
one of Chris Cavalline’s three
hits highlighted the inning.

On Friday, the Generals
played poorly in dropping a 9-2
decision to Longwood. .

‘“‘We didn’t play up to our ex-
pectations and we were a little
sloppy in the field,’ explained
Murdock.

A Saturday doubleheader
with Emory and Henry was
rained out. The games were
supposed to be W&L’s first
league contests.

W&L finally opened the
league schedule with an 8-6 win
over Bridgewater at home
Tuesday. Dave Randall picked
up the win to raise his record to
30 and Bill White earned a
save.

Craig Cannon and Wes
Yonge, numbers one and two on
the team, respectively, were on
the wrong side of luck Tuesday
as they both lost their singles
and doubles matches. Cannon
dropped an 8-6 tiebreaker to
lose 7-6,6-4, and Yonge suffered
a 4-6,6-3,3-6 defeat. The doubles
team of Cannon and Charlie
Kalocsay lost 4-6,4-6, and
Yonge-Jim Irwin followed suit,

Cannon shook his head after
losing his singles match and
said, ‘I missed so many easy
shots.”’ His singles opponent,
Mike Yarborough of
Greensboro, took a five second
“Slow motion” service delivery
before booming his serve at
Cannon.

“It (the serve) bothered me a
lot,’’ said Cannon, who was also
frustrated with his opponent’s
mixture of ‘pushing’ (soft
shots) and “kills” during the
match.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Cops And/Or Robbers

So the Lexington Police Department has a few of-
ficers who decided to earn a little extra money while
on the job. Does it really surprise anyone that we have
a few policemen who decided to work against, and not
with, the law?

But before we go blaming the L.P.D. for all of this
town’s problems, let’s look at what this university has
done to protect its students. We have janitors who
spend their time lounging around the dorms watching
‘Love Boat” reruns or handing out betting cards. We
have a group of night watchmen who sit in the
warmth of the Student Center watching ‘‘Quincy” and
“Vegas” reruns. These people do their jobs, but
they’re usually two steps behind every crime on cam-

 

 

 

pus.

Meanwhile, cars parked outside the Student Center
suffer stolen antenna, license plates, batteries,
radios, etc. In the freshmen dorms, students learn at
an early stage to keep their doors locked. In the
fraternities, students come back from break with the
dread of not knowing if the house remained
unpenetrated.

The time has come for this university to give its
students some adequate protection. The school should
hire some trained guards, not the group of handymen
it has now. When we no longer can trust our fellow
man, we have lost our honor. And without honor and
: honor system, this school does not have much to of-

er.

The L.P.D. can no longer be trusted and our univer-
sity’s security force is not adequate. If the university
wants its students to enjoy Lexington, it should
student that Lexington does not get the best of the

President Leonid Brezhnev for
a freeze of medium-ranged
nuclear weapons in Europe is
misleading. While he supports
reductions of strategic theater
nuclear weapons, he said, the
freeze proposed by Brezhnev
would give a decided edge to the
Soviets.

The former president found
fault with one aspect of the ad-
ministration’s response to
events in Poland.

“It was a mistake to have our
government not force Poland
into default,’ he said. “It’s a

harsh judgement, but I think
you can agree —by paying their
debt, we’re sponsoring martial
law in Poland.”

Ford lambasted Democrats
in Congress — a favorite oc-
cupation —saying they keep ad-
ding to a budget deficit they
themselves scream about day
in and day out now. He also
reveled in reciting unemploy-
ment, inflation and prime rate
figures at the time he left office
in 1977 — ‘and turned the wheel
over to Jimmy Carter, whose
mistakes he suggested we are
dearly paying for right now.

Entertainment

With Spring Comes......Oscar

by Todd Jones

Oscar time has rolled around
again, and I, like all people who
are interested in movies have
made my predictions as to who
or what will capture academy
awards on Monday. Included in
this article are my predictions
as well as my _ personal
favorites.

Best Actor: Nominated are
Henry Fonda for On Golden
Pond, Warren Beatty for Reds,
Dudley Moore for Arthur, Paul
Newman for Absence of Malice,
and Burt Lancaster for Atlantic
City. My personal favorite here
is also who I think will get the
Oscar this year: Henry Fonda.
Fonda’s performance as a man
obsessed with dying was ex-
cellent. He’ll capture the sen-
timental vote as well, for if he
wins, it will be his first Oscar
for a performance.

Best Actress: Diane Keaton
for Reds, Kathryn Hepburn for
On Golden Pond, Marsha
Mason, for Only When I Laugh,
Susan Sarandon for Atlantic Ci-
ty, and Meryl Streep for The
French Lieutenant’s Woman.
The choice here will be between
sentimental favorite Hepburn,
popular favorite Keaton, and
the exact performance of
Streep. I pick Hepburn, but
barely.

Supporting Actor:
Nicholson for Reds, James Coco
for Only When I Laugh, Sir John
Gielgud for Arthur, Ian Holm
for Chariots of Fire, and
Howard Rolling for Ragtime.
My personal favorite is Sir John
Gielgud for his hilarious role as
the butler in Arthur. However,
he’ll have stiff competition
from Nicholson for his brilliant
characterization of Eugene

Jack °

O’Neill in Reds. Still a toss-up.

Supporting Actress: Maureen
Stapleton for Reds, Melinda
Dillon for Absence of Malice,
Joan Hackett for Only When I
Laugh, Elizabeth McGovern for
Ragtime, and Jane Fonda for
On Golden Pond. While
Stapleton was tremendous as
Emma Goldman in Reds, her
part was too small to compare
to that of Elizabeth McGovern.
McGovern will win.

Best Picture: Reds, On
Golden Pond, Atlantic City,
Raiders of the Lost Ark,

Chariots of Fire. This is the
toughest of all categories for
me. It is hard to decide whether
the voters will opt for the thrill-
ing escapism of Raiders, the
sentimentality of On Golden
Pond, the simplicity of Chariots
of Fire, or the grandeur of

‘92 In The Shade’ At Lewis

by Patrick Hinely

The Washington and Lee Film Society’s seventh
presentation for the season will be Thomas
McGuane’s comedy 92 in the Shade (USA, 1975: 93
minutes). Screenings will be held on Friday and
Saturday, March 26 and 27, at 8:00 p.m. in
classroom ‘‘A’’ of Lewis Hall, the W&L Law
School. Admission is free.

McGuane is best known as a novelist and screen-
writer, and this film is unique in presenting him in
both of these lights, as well as being his sole direc-
torial credit to date. His other novels have includ-
ed The Sporting Club (1969), The Bushwhacked
Piano, Panama (1978), and the recently published
An Outside Chance. McGuane’s screenwriting
credits include Rancho Deluxe (1975), directed by
Frank Perry, and The Missouri Breaks (1976),
directed by Arthur Penn.

92 in the Shade is a contemporary epic of the
peculiarly American competition ethic of the
smal] businessman, played out by a bizarre trio of
freelance fishing guides in Key West, Florida.
Like the city itself, the story straddles that line
unique to the tropics, between impoverished lux-
ury and circumstantial madness.

Skelton, played by Peter Fonda, is the local boy
come home from a typically 60’s psychedelic col-
lege experience with nothing in particular on his
mind except how to deal graciously with a family
which includes the local power broker and several
others who are at most partially sane. He decides
to take up guiding, much to the chagrin of Carter,
played by Harry Dean Stanton, and Nichol Dance,
masterfully characterized by Warren Oates, both
of whom are firmly ensconced in the status quo.
Carter’s subtle scheming drives Dance to acts of

 

redneck madness. Skelton, more laid back, even-
tually turns to fighting fire with fire as he tunes in
to the post-acid surreality of the Key West en-
vironment.

The screenplay holds true to the novel up to the
last moment, at which point optimism overtakes
cynicism, leading one to wonder what happened in
McGuane’s own life between publication of the
novel in 1973 and direction of the movie in 1975. In
critical terms, McGuane’s career has been
somewhat speckled, with current opinion being
that he peaked with the writing of 92 in the Shade.
The film’s commercial debut was less than spec-
tacular, but that seems to have been due more to
the caprices of corporate management than to the
quality of the film itself.

Vincent Canby, in The New York Times,
described the film as being “full of odd,
headstrong, seemingly disconnected moments
that only a novelist would dare, and it’s a field day
for the actors.’’ Besides Oates, Fonda, and Stan-
ton, the cast includes Burgess Meredith as
Skelton’s-eccentric grandfather, Margot Kidder
as Miranda, Skelton’s schoolteacher girlfriend,
and William Hickey as Skelton’s voluntarily in-
sane father.

On April 30 and May 1, the Film Society will
show Carlos Saura’s Cria (Spain, 1977: 115
minutes), a movie from the new Spain, since
Franco. The W&L Film Society brings to Lex-
ington recent films of quality which commercial
outlets choose to ignore, at least on the local scene.
It is funded in part by the student body, and in part
by private contributors. Contributions are very
much appreciated.

years would lead me to pick On
Golden Pond, which is much in
the style of Kramer and

Reds might just win out, but 1
doubt it.

“Kiehne filled in very well, and
once we got the ball, we held it
well.”

With the. score tied at two
after the first quarter, junior
Bob Carpenter put W&L ahead
by using a pick, sliding to his
right and putting a shot over the
shoulder of starting goalie Tom
Wagner at 13:08 of the second
quarter.

After State tied it again with a
screen shot that bounced by
Ware Palmer, the Generals
took the lead for good on two
consecutive goals by Staugaitis.
On the second one, Staugaitis
took the ball at midfield, rushed
down the left side uncontested
and beat Wagner on the long
side with a bouncer.

W&L almost turned the game
into a rout by taking an 8-4 lead
with 11 minutes to go in the
third quarter. John Buttarazzi
converted a rebound after the
initial shot by Lee Heimert.
John Doub then made it 7-4
when he connected on a crisp
pass from Staugaitis.

At that point, Wagner was
replaced with sophomore Dave
Kennan. Keenan was quickly

beaten by Jeff Mason who took
Mike Lewers’ pass from behind
the goal and slammed it in.

But by the end of the quarter
the Wolfpack had tied it at nine.
The last two scores came with
less than half a minute to go.

After Scott Nelson made it
nine to eight, Kevin Sullivan
notched his third goal of the day
when he beat Palmer with a
backhander, even though he
was facing away from the goal
and had two defensemen cover-
ing him.

John Sancilio’s tenth goal of
the season, a low shot from
eight yards out, put W&L ahead
for good. With 9:52 left,
Staugaitis faked out Keenan to
make the margin 11-9. The
Generals then used up the clock
when State was called for two
straight penalties.

Two goals by Keimert put the
game out of question. After Tim
Nelson made it 13-10 with five
minutes remaining, State was
whistled for another penalty,
The loss dropped the Wolfpack
to 2-2.

W&L’s last game before ex-
ams will be this Saturday at 2
p.m. on Wilson Field against
Towson State.

by J.R. Smith

After listening to Student Ac-
tivities Board Co-Chairman
John Martin’s plans for spring
entertainment, the Executive
Committee allocated additional
funds to the S.A.B. in the Mon-
day night meeting of the E.C.

To offset the S.A.B.’s_pro-
jected budget deficit of nearly
$3,000 and to allow for a spring
program of music, the E.C.
moved to deposit $4,537 in the
board’s account.

This money will come from
the E.C.’s Dreyfus money
market account, which will
bring around $3,800, and an
allocation from the Student
Reserve Fund to make up the
difference. $4,000 will remain in
the reserve fund after the
withdrawl.

Martin explained his plans for
the spring, which include an ap-
pearance by Skip Castro on the
first Tuesday of the term, and
an appearance by the
Nighthawks in the following
Friday. Both of the events
would be ‘‘basically  self-
supporting,” in the words of
Martin. Other bands tentatively
slated to appear are the
Michael Guthrie Band, the
Monarchs, The Deal, and The
Convertibles.

“Tuesday in the Pit,” which

 

Martin referred to as a pro-
gram he would like to see con-
tinue after his graduation, could
include such groups as the Good
Humor Band and Bruce Olsen
and the Offenders.

Martin also said the movie
program would continue if the
S.A.B. could show two x-rated
films in order to make a profit.
The place for showing the films
has not been settled since du-
Pont auditorium was closed
following problems over the last
porn film.

Martin also discussed a possi-
ble spring concert, tentatively
slated for May 8. The concert
would follow the lacrosse game
with Hofstra, and would feature
a big-name band. The funds for
this concert could possibly
come from the Interfraternity
Council and the junior class.

In other matters, the E.C.
heard reports from the Calyx,
Focus and the Mock Convention
Committee.

Calyx Editor Jack Huskin and
Business Manager Scott Fitz-
gerald reported that the year-
book is close to completion.
“We have one set of ptoffs to
look at, then it’s all finished,”’
said Huskin. He added that the
tentative date for the Calyx’s
release to the student body is
May 25.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Student Condemns

 

 

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

A Good Move

For all the criticism that it receives for its fiscal
policy, the Executive Committee did a serious right
Monday by giving more money to the Student Ac-

~ tivities Board. Rather than dressing down the S.A.B.
for its loss of money, the E.C. did the only just thing —
it gave the entertainment group enough money to
keep the campus in music for the rest of the year.

We do not mean to advocate fiscal disaster. The
S.A.B. lost its shirt, and then some, over Fancy Dress.
But to deprive the campus of spring entertainment for
the mistakes of February and March seem unjust.
The E.C. did the right thing — it guaranteed that
students would be given entertainment for the spring.

We have criticized the E.C. for not accomplishing
much this year. Monday night’s allocation of funds for
the S.A.B. may not go down in campus history as
earth-shattering, but it does demonstrate that the
E.C. at times works in the interest of the student
body. And this is the way student government is in-
tended to be.

THE RING-TUM PHI WILL
NOT BE PUBLISHED AGAIN
UNTIL APRIL 22.
HAVE A GOOD BREAK.

 

  
    
   
 

Dear Sir:

In reading last week’s
editorial in the Ring-tum Phi, I
was at first struck by the in-
telligent thoughts on the issue of
campus security. Had good
journalism creeped into our
paper? A few paragraphs later

’T soon saw that this was not to

be.

The statement that Wash-
ington and Lee has little more to
offer than an honor system is an
outrage, and an insult to the en-
tire W&L community. We have
an administration that deeply
cares about its students, as fine
a faculty that one may find on
the undergraduate level, and a
student body both so talented
and diverse, that it attacks-
Academics, Parties - and
Lacrosse with equal en-
thusiasm (well, almost equal
enthusiasm). Not to mention a
beautiful campus and a proud
and rich tradition.

Maybe the person(s) respon-
sible for this editorial is con-
nected with the New York

Big Lex’s
Dear Sir:

I am happy to announce that
the inhabitants of Lexington
can relax. In spite of the recent
suspensions of several mem-
bers of the illustrious Lexington
Police Department, a few
fearless officers continue to do
their jobs...relentlessly. That’s
right, there is no need to fear a
lawless society taking over in
Lexington. -

Case in Point:

Time: 4:35 A.M.

Date: 26 March 1982

Suspect: 21 year old male
Caucasian

Occupation: Student

The suspect was spotted by
Lexington Police Department
Officer Charles Carpenter turn-
ing onto South Main Street, win-
dows up, obeying all traffic
regulations and ordinances.
There was, however, one viola-
tion of the civil code which of-
ficer Carpenter could not let go
unchecked. Indeed, in the of-
ficer’s opinion, this breach of
the legal system was of great
enough magnitude to disregard
the police dispatcher’s call re-
questing assistance in transpor-
ting an injured citizen to the
hospital, which could be heard
on the radio as Carpenter stop-
ped and approached the
suspect’s car. Grand larceny?
Rape? Murder? All of the
above??! No!
Carpenter issued the suspect a
police summons to the Com-
monwealth of Virginia City
Court for a violation of the noise
ordinance. That’s right, the
suspect’s car stereo was turned
up too loud and without warn-
ing, he was issued a noise viola-
tion.

Times. They also seem to have
an altered perception of W&L.
I’m proud of my school, as I
know most other members of
the Washington and Lee com-
munity are. Maybe the writer of

the editorial might consider
another school. How about a
community college offering
remedial journalism courses.

Hasty Judgement?

Dear Sir:

This is in response to your
editorial concerning ‘‘Cops and
Robbers” in last week’s issue of
the Ring-tum Phi.

Can You Honestly Judge?
“Pray don’t find fault with the
man who limps or stumbles

Unless you have worn the shoes
he wears or struggled beneath
his load.

There may be tacks in his shoes
that hurt, though hidden from

I have spent three and a half
years in Lexington: Fall,
Winter, Spring, and Summer. I
have heard cars with open

top-flight officers like Charles

That caused his fall, or felt the
shame that only the fallen
know.

You may be strong, but still the
blows that were his, if dealt to
you

In the self-same way at the

Law School Helps

Students in several Rock-
bridge County high schools and
middle schools are receiving in-
struction in various aspects of
the American legal system
courtesy of a Washington and
Lee University law school
fraternity.

Members of Phi Alpha Delta
Law Fraternity. are par-
ticipating in the fraternity’s
Juvenile Justice Program, a na-
tionwide effort to educate youth
in the role of law in American
society.

‘We are attempting to show
the students in area high
schools and middle schools that
the legal system is not exactly
what they see on television
reruns of Perry Mason or
Adam-12,”’ explained David
(Freedi) Friedfeld, a second-
year law student at Washington
and Lee and coordinator of the
Juvenile Justice Program at
W&L.

According to Friedfeld, 14
members of Phi Alpha Delta
have volunteered their time to
participate in the program.

Friedfeld heads a steering
committee that consists of two
other second-year law students,

Lee Moise and Michael Bon.
merito along with W&L law pro-
fessor William Geimer, Lex-
ington High School principal
Glenn Stark, and Judge Robert
Culpepper, judge of the juvenile
and domestic relations district
court in Rockbridge County.

The program was six months
in the planning stages before
the first presentations were
made in February when eighth-
grade civics classes at Parry
McCluer Middle School in
Buena Vista received a week of
instruction in the criminal
justice system.

So far, the Phi Alpha Delta
members have given similar
presentations at Parry McCluer
High School, Lexington High
School, Rockbridge High
School, and Brownsburg Middle
School.

All high schools and middle
schools in Rockbridge County
were approached by Friedfeld
‘last fall and were offered 12 dif-
ferent topics from which the
school officials could choose.
The topics ranged from crimi-
nal justice, which requires five
class periods to present, to a
two-period discussion of correc-
tional facilities.

W&L Baseball Mired InSlump —

by Andrew P. Hoppes
Washington and ‘Lee’s
baseball team dropped a 7-4
decision to Randolph-Macon on

Tuesday to extend a losing

streak to four games.

Since the Generals last tasted
victory against Bridgewater,
they have lost 6-3 to Lock
Haven, 5-1 to Randolph-Macon,
10-7 to Duke, and 7-4 to
Randolph-Macon to drop their
record to 46.

‘“‘We’re not losing confidence
in ourselves. We still think we'll
make the tournament. Mentally
we’re not there everyday,
though,’”’ observed coach Jim
Murdock.

Another factor Murdock cited
as fueling the skid was a lack of
hitting with men on_ base.
Through ten games, the
Generals have left 82 men on
base.

In the loss to Lock Haven last
Wednesday, the Generals fell
behind 3-0 after two innings and
never recovered in losing 6-3.

W&L did manage to mount a
comeback in the ninth inning,
however. With two outs, Chris
Cavalline ripped an RBI double.
Jeff Haggerty followed with an
RBI single, but it was too little,
too late.

The next day, the Generals
lost 5-1 at Randolph-Macon in
an ODAC contest. Rich
Hachenberg absorbed the pitch-

ing loss.

“We only had three or four
hits. We also made some costly
errors in the field,”’ noted Mur-
dock. '

In a Saturday slugfest with
Duke, the Generals nearly
upset the Atlantic Coast Con-
ference team, but fell 10-7. ‘‘We
scared them,” remarked Mur-
dock.

After Duke had scored eight
times in the first three stanzas,
the Generals rallied in the third
to make the score 8-7. Both
Tripp Brower and Chris
Cavalline ripped two-run
homers in the inning.

The Generals could not over-
come their defensive mistakes,
though. W&L committed five
errors which let in three runs,
and W&L hurlers yielded three
home runs on the windy day.

In Tuesday’s game, the all too
familiar pattern continued.
W&L fell behind 6-1 to
Randolph-Macon and then
could not catch the Yellow
Jackets in the 7-4 loss.

Macon lit up Washington and
Lee starter Billy White for six
runs in the first four innings. A
mixture of walks, errors and
some very hard hits by Macon
contributed to the defeat.

W&L fought back, however,
with two runs of their own in the
bottom half of the fourth to
close the gap to 6-3.

Generally Speaking

 

With Mike Walsh and Dave
Warrenfeltz on base after a pair
of singles, Brower singled to
center to score Walsh. When
Brower tried to advance to se-
cond on the play, the Yellow
Jackets committed a throwing
error that allowed Warrenfeltz
toscore.

The lead narrowed to 6-4 after
the sixth when W&L pushed
across another run.

After walks to Haggerty and
Walsh, Warrenfeltz forced
Walsh to second, putting run-
ners at the corners. Haggerty
scored when Brower’s grounder
was bobbled by the Randolph-
Macon shortstop.

Meanwhile, White had settled
down after his rocky start. He
blanked the Yellow Jackets for
four straight innings before
yielding a final run in the ninth.

W&L threatened to tie the
score in the bottom of the ninth,
but again came up short.

Mark McLaughlin reached
base on an error and Jody Har-
ris lined a single to left to start
the inning. They were left
stranded, however, as the next
three Generals were retired.
Cavalline’s two-out flyball was
hauled down just short of the
fence.

The Generals met Col; ‘te at
home yesterday in thier final
action before exams and will
return to the diamond on April
13 at Hampden-Sydney.

 

“We're not losing confidence
in ourselves.”

Yes, W&L, Lexington Does Have A Golf Course

by G. Bruce Potter

At the midway point of the
spring sports schedule, let’s
take a look at what the various
Washington and Lee sports
teams have accomplished so far
and what they can look forward
to after spring break:

Golf

You would think that golf
would be the most popular sport
at a supposedly rich and preppy
institution like W&L, but that is
certainly not the case. In fact,
one student was heard to say
recently, ‘“You mean Lexington
has a golf course?”’

Well, they do, and coach Buck
Leslie has an outstanding golf
team led by senior captains Jim

Kaplan and Bill Alfano. The
squad is 3) and placed third
among Division III teams in a
North Carolina tournament
earlier in the month and tenth
at an open event (any division)
at James Madison University.
They look very strong for the
ODAC championships April 26
and 27 at Hampden-Sydney.
Meanwhile, they will compete
in the Virginia Tech ‘‘Gobbler
Classic” over the break.
Tennis

Take a look at the record of
the tennis team, 4-9, and one
would assume that they were
having an “‘off’’ year. But that
is far from the truth as most of
those losses have come against

Nominations for the

Dean Gilliam Award

are due in the Executive Committee room
by 6:30 p.m. on Monday, April 19th

The award is given to the student who has made the greatest
contribution to the university. The selection will be made by
the undergraduate members of the E.C.

Division I and II competition.
Actually, the squad only has
five Division III teams on its
schedule before the ODAC tour-
nament at Washington and Lee
April 30-May 1.

Led by Craig Cannon and Wes
Yonge and balanced by
freshmen Stephen Bendheim
and Andy Haring, the squad will
go south for the break to meet
some tough competition.
However, coach Gary Franke
believes that the difficult op-
ponents will better prepare the
team for tournament time.

Lacrosse

Not only does the lacrosse
squad play tough teams, they
also manage to beat them, as

 

everyone is well aware unless
they’ve been buried in the
library studying for finals the
last three weeks.

Ranked eighth in the nation,
according to the latest
U.S.I.L.A. Division I poll, the
Generals own a 5-1 record, the
loss an 11-10 overtime heart-
breaker to Navy. Employing a
patient, ball-control offense and
a tenacious defense, the squad
seems to have sét a pattern of
playing the game close for
three-and-a-half quarters

before putting their opponent
away.

_The most recent example was
the 13-12 overtime defeat of
Towson State last Saturday.

John Tunney, junior mid-
fielder just out of the hospital
after being hit in the throat by a
stick, typified the spirit and
determination of this year’s
squad by winning three crucial
faceoffs' down the stretch, the
last to open the extra stanza.
Towson State was never able to
even clear the ball thereafter,
and Sancilio’s goal with 1:39 left
gave W&L their first overtime
triumph since 1979.

‘Fine Comeback’ Gives Lax 13-12 Overtime Win

by John Harrison

“It was a fine comeback in a
tough situation,” said head
lacrosse coach Jack Emmer in
describing Washington and
Lee’s 13-12 overtime win over
Towson State last Saturday.

Senior midfielder John San-
cilio forced the game into the
extra period with his third goal
of the day with only 25 seconds
left in regulation time. The
Generals’ leading goal scorer
then put in the sudden-death
winner at the 1:39 mark by tak-
ing an inbounds pass at the top
of Towson’s box and moving
past defenseman Rich Murphy
before beating Tiger goalie
Mark Williams from ten yards.

The victory made W&L 5-1
and raised its national ranking
in the latest poll to eighth.
Towson dropped its second deci-
sion in as many games.

Although Emmer believed
that the Generals’ last match

A young Washington and Lee

day and Newport News Friday.

Golf Wins
Tri-Meet

by B. Scott Tilley

Playing against bad condi-
tions and without number-one
seed Titus Harris, the
Washington and Lee golf team
still managed to defeat
Bridgewater College and
Shepherd College in a tri-meet
last Thursday to up its record to
3-0.

Jim Kaplan’s 75 paced the
squad, which turned in a five-
man team score of 395.
Bridgewater finished second at
4l7 and Shepherd third at 430.
Del Agnew carded a 79, Bill
Alfano, Bruce Blythe and Dick
Emrey turned in 80’s and Tom
Webb came in with an 81 for the
Generals.

Even with the two victories,
Coach Buck Leslie had hoped to
see a better team score turned
in. ‘‘We did play without Harris,
who was in New York, and the
conditions—wind and tough pin
placement—made it difficult.
We had to work for the 80’s.
Sometimes the course just
won't let you go.”’

prior to Spring break did not
have as much finesse and fan
appeal as have previous match-
es this season, he was pleased
with the effort put out in spite of
recent injuries at the midfield
and attack positions.

“‘We have a few guys bumped
up,” said the coach while refer-
ring to Rich Schoenberg, who
had taken over for the injured
John Tunney as the team’s
leading faceoff man, and Joe
Seifert, who had six goals
before he sustained a bruised
elbow.

Tunney returned to action
against Towson after recover-
ing from an injury to the vocal
cords. ‘John got the job done
after being out for eight days,”’
remarked Emmer about the
junior midfielder.

But what impressed Emmer
above all was W&L’s ability to
be aggressive in going for loose

Sophomore Charlie Alcorn
claimed two individual events
Friday, the shot put and the
discus, to lead the squad to an
easy 94-51 victory.

The Generals won four of
seven field events and seven of
ten running competitions.
Freshman Keith Busbee paced
the way on the track by captur-
ing the 400-meter event and par-

- ticipating on the Generals vic-

torious 400- and mile-relay
squads.

Angus McBryde, 1500-meters,
Alan Armitage, 110-meter
hurdlés, Mark Pembroke, 800-
meters, and Greg Branan, 5000-
meters, also picked up in-
dividual running titles.

Busbee ran with classmates
Scott Henderson and Chris Ives
and sophomore Kevin Kadesky
to win the 400-relay in 45.4
seconds and with Henderson,
Martin and Paul Chapman to
capture the mile relay in
3:36.22.

The Generals won 10 of 17
events Tuesday to score 114
points in defeating Roanoke, 40,
and Eastern Mennonite, 24.

-Four Generals are listed for
having the best performance in
the conference in a specific
event after last weekend’s com-
petition. Alcorn’s discus toss of
119-7, Pembroke’s 800-meter
time of 1:57.5, McBryde’s 1500-
meter clocking of 4:02.67 and

Tennis Squad Endures

Disappointing Weekend

by David Stuart

Losses- to George Mason
University and Virginia Com-
monwealth University by iden-
tical scores of 6-3 turned the
Washington and Lee tennis
team’s four-game homestand
into frustration and disappoint-
ment last weekend.

Friday, the team was tied 3-3
with VCU after six very close
singles matches. The doubles
were a different story, however,
as all three of the Generals’
pairs lost. The number three
duo of Andy Haring and Stephen
Bendheim lost 7-6, 6-4 and Craig
Cannon and, Charlie Kalocsay,
the number one team, split sets
before losing 6-1,4-6,1-6.

In contrast, W&L took all
three doubles matches handily
against George Mason but drop-
ped all six singles matches.
Cannon, Kalocsay and Bend-
heim split sets and Jim Irwin
and Andy Haring lost tie-
breakers. Wes Yonge mounted
a desperate comeback but fell
short, 0-6,5-7.

Coach Gary Franke said that
he was “disappointed” with the
6-3 losses and thought his
players could play better. He
admits the schedule is challeng-

ing but adds, ‘‘We haven’t risen
to the occasion.”’

Franke says the team needs
to ‘develop concentration” on
the court. Many of the players
complained that upcoming ex-
am pressures on top of a heavy
match schedule (six matches in
seven days) is tiring. ‘‘I have
too much on my mind,”’ said
Kalocsay after one match and
Haring admitted feeling
“pressure”’ from exams.

The week was not a total loss
for W&L, however, as_ they
destroyed Emory and Henry 8-1
last week and Shepherd College
9-0 on Tuesday. In other match-
es, the Harvard junior varsity
squad and James Madison
University overpowered, the
Generals 9-0.

After heading south for five
matches over spring break, the
team’s next home match will be
on Sunday, Apr. 25, against
William and Mary.

and assisted on Sancilio’s first

Two’of Schuler’s goals came
in early in the fourth quarter to
give the Generals their last lead

heroics.

The Generals do not return.to

Shaffer Speaks On Christian Lawyers

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity law professor Thomas L.
Shaffer told an audience at the
Legal Ethics Institute last week
that the “moral command or
example for us professionals is
that we take on the servant’s
task...”’

Shaffer, the author of a book
entitled ‘“‘On Being a Christian
and a Lawyer,” addressed a
group of both practicing
lawyers and Washington and
Lee undergraduates who were
participating in the three-day
Legal Ethics Institute. The in-

cereus cmt muaaiiaaesasiamsuician ines uieaaitasiasiiiutiisamsnsiiatitaaiimmainiimaanitaiaamaiaiammmmamimaimaitiion
nS A SE CAS ETC A TESST NEE TS,

 

The Richmond Ballet!

stitute is part of W&L’s in-
novative program in applied
ethics, “Society and the Profes-
sions.”

Using the Biblical image of
the ‘“‘suffering servant,’’ Shaf-
fer said that lawyers ‘‘are not
merely to serve (their clients) ;
we are to be their servants, and
to expect to suffer for it. This is
a clear and radical command.”

Added Shaffer: ‘The aim of
our, moral life with our
clients...is that we serve in such
a way that the person served

 

 

will himself become a servant
— that he will himself be moved
to love, to good works, to the
company of those who serve.”’

By accepting the servant’s
task, said Shaffer, lawyers
serve God “‘by being servants to
our clients, by being servants in
suffering, in powerlessness, and
in reconciliation. That. is the
legal ethics of servanthood, the
way to be a Christian and a'
lawyer.”

As servant to his client, a
lawyer hopes that his client will
be free and that in his freedom
the client ‘‘will see clearly and
choose bravely and end up do-
ing the right thing,” said Shaf-
fer.

The lawyer-servant also
hopes that his client ‘will grow
in virtue, will not only make
right choices but will become
the sort of person who makes
right choices. I want him to be
better than he would have been
if I had not stumbled into his
life.”’

Shaffer joined the W&L law
faculty in 1980 after previously
serving as dean of the Universi-
ty of Notre Dame’s law school.
He has published numerous ar-
ticles and has lectured widely in
the area of legal ethics.

The S.A.B. Is Alive And Kicking For Spring Term

by Gil Kingman

For the past few weeks,
rumours have spread that the
Spring term, with its partying
potential, will come and go un-
noticed. After Monday night’s
decision by the Executive Com-
mittee, it appears that the Stu-
dent Activities Board will in-
deed provide the community
with music.

Is ‘“‘Tuesday’s” dead? Ap-
parently not. The S.A.B. will
continue to bring quality enter-
tainment to the campus. Spring
term entertainment will start
on the Tuesday after break with
a performance by Skip Castro
in the Cockpit. But the April 20
performance by Skip is not the

only one planned. Nther bands,

including Telluride and the
Good Humor Band, will be in-
cluded on the schedule.

But what about beyond
“‘Tuesday’s?”’ To kickoff the
festivities for the lacrosse game
with the North Carolina
Tarheels, the Nighthawks will
perform on Friday night, April
23; at the Pavillion. More
weekend entertainment at the
Cockpit, including the Deal, is
also planned.

Also included in the S.A.B.’s
plans is a Spring Weekend,
which will tentatively be held
May 8. The perormance, by a
topflight band that has yet to be

named, will be sponsored by |
both the S.A.B. and the junior |

class.

You Can Take Only A Two-Hour Ride To Monterey

(Author’s Note: This article was
written for last week’s paper, but
the editors, in their infinite
wisdom, found no room for it. So,
you can go to Monterey if you
like, but the festival was over last

waenene? by John Wells —

If you have nothing to do this
weekend, I might suggest scal-
ing a few mountains to attend
the Highland County Maple
Festival.

Being a Virginian, I frequent-
ly extoll the diverse and
unusual features of the state.
The Maple Festival is quite uni-
que to the region, in fact the
southern-most event of its kind.

Beautiful Highland County is
mountainous to the ~point of
almost resembling Vermont or
New Hampshire. Maple trees
there have been bursting with
sugar water each spring for
centuries, and the county
depends on the festival: to help

boost an otherwise anemic
economy.

Unfortunately for visitors in-
terested in the sugar process,
the trees all sapped out early
this year. But this doesn’t at all
detract from enjoyment deriv-
ed from the essential purpose of
the day, which is to stuff oneself
like a pig.

Arrive in Monterey, about
two hours from Lexington. The
county seat is a picturesque
village of neatly-kept clapboard
homes surrounded by picket
fences. Ordinarily, the place to
eat here is the Maple Res-
taurant, a landmark identified
by the large, glaring pink and
aqua neon flashing fish perched
on its roof. During the festival,
however, food is also served at
the local schools and in smaller,
surrounding communities.

Highland Elementary, for in-
stance, serves from 9 a.m. to 6

published in 1950 by the Ad-
visory Council on the Virginia
Economy.

Rasasco is a 1951 graduate of
W&L with a B.S. degree in com-
merce. He is president of and
operates six corporations that
specialize in real estate and
land development and are head-
quartered in Milton, Fla.

Extremely active in civic af-
fairs, Rosasco is president of
the Democratic County Chair-
man’s Association State of
Florida and is a past recipient
of the coveted Santa Rosa Coun-
ty Chamber of Commerce Man
of the Year Award and the
Thomas A. Leonard Humani-
tarian Award from the Jaycees.

p.m., and for less than four
dollars you get sausage or ham,
coffee and all the buckwheat or
regular pancakes with butter
and that dreamy pure maple
syrup you can eat. The
buckwheat cakes, with their
distinct flavor and texture, are
infinitely preferable.

Then it’s over another moun-
tain to Blue Grass (formerly
Crab Bottom) for more spec-
tacular scenery and a close look
at one of the maple orchards.

The closest orchard is Rex-
rode’s, where ancient, gnarled
maples are plugged and drain-
ed using modern plastic tubing.
They still boil down the sugar
water in long shallow vats;
about 60 gallons of the water
produces one gallon of the
syrup, which is amber-colored,
not extremely thick and quite
sweet.

The Virginia Program at Ox-
ford, which is supported by
Washington and Lee and five
other colleges in the state, is ex-
periencing some difficulty here.

Dean Pamela Simpson says
the school is currently losing
money on the program, with 16
participants signed up and four
more needed to break even.

a

In 1981 he served as Good Will
Ambassador for the State of
Florida to Denmark and Queen
Margrethe II during the Annual
4th of July Festival at Rebild in
Aalborn. Rosasco is author of
“Musings, In God We Trust,”
published in 1981 by the Univer-
sity of West Florida Alumni
Association.

Monterey, it’s a good idea to
burn off breakfast by walking
around the steep hills and
woods. The terrain is either
straight uphill or down and af-
fords a beautiful view of the
tall, sprawling Alleghenies.

To really do the weekend up
right, many visitors stay over-
night in the recently restored
Highland Inn in Monterey. The
turn-of-the-century hotel faces
Main Street with a double-
decked porch which runs the
length of the building. Over-
nighters can really get into the
whole scene by attending even-
ing events like the Maple
Queen’s Ball, the Sugar Shake-
up, the Buckwheat Stomp or the
Festival Fling.

— Rasasco Oxford Deadline

In order to encourage more
students to sign up by extending
the deadline for application to
May 1. So far, three W&L
students have applied for the
program as well as seven from
Sweet Briar, one from
Hampden-Sydney, and five
from Mary Baldwin. The other
schools participating in the pro-
gram are V.M.I. and Roanoke
College.

The Oxford program is a very
worthwhile one, as any W&L
participant in it will tell you.
Those interested in more infor-
mation about the program
should make a beeline for Dean
Simpson’s office and remember

. the May 1 deadline.

the courthouse; craft and anti-
que shows; blacksmith demon-
strations; and — you guessed it
— more food! Country ham
served on hot rolls, maple
doughnuts fresh-made by the
Mill Gap Ruritan Club (takes
about 45 minutes standing in
line to get a box), pretzels and
cheeses made by Mennonite
farmers and maple candy
shaped like leaves in various
sizes.

While most of the food isn’t
outrageously expensive, neither
is it cheap. The ham rolls are
$1.30, for instance, and the
maple leaves are 30 or 60 cents
depending on the size. Bags
with a half-dozen little shell-
shaped candies go for $1 each.

It doesn’t take long to gb up to,
Monterey, but don’t forget to
visit the General Store, a well-
preserved piece of Americana

Monterey

(continued from page 7)
which sells food, hardware and
clothing in narrow aisles with
tall shelves and lots of at-
mosphere.

In case you were wondering,
it’s time for dinner now. Varia-
tions are served in the schools,
but the chowdown I can vouch
for is in tiny McDowell, about
five miles east of Monterey.
There, the McDowell Volunteer
Fire Department Firehouse has
long folding tables set up for the
day-long feed.

There, for $4.50, one may
choose from trout, barbequed
chicken or ham (the fresh
mountain trout is by far the
best) and green beans, baked
potato, coleslaw, all the
homemade bread and apple-
sauce you can eat, coffee or tea
and a slice of cake toiled over
by a fire dept wife.

From there, contented
festival-goers may waddle back
to their respective wheels and

 

 

head back to Lex. (it should be
about 6 p.m. by now) or
wherever.

Fifteen dollars plus a tank of
gas and a cooler of beer can get
you through the day. and the
more the merrier. It’s
pleasurable and slow-paced, a
day to enjoy the most basic of
activities, but it isn’t cool to
drink in public.

Directions: a number of op-
tions — take I-81 to Staunton
and from there U.S. 250 all the
way to Monterey. Or take U.S.
39 through Goshen to Warm
Springs, and Rt. 220 from there
to Monterey. Any route will
take approximately two hours
to travel. Those who like rambl-
ing drives through isolated
stretches might want to take 39
through Goshen to Va. 678,
which turns right, in front of an
old brick church. This goes
through a valley of old farms on
a decent road on which other
vehicles are rarely seen.

Turner Publishes

WWI Memoirs

Dr. Charles Turner, history
professor at Washington and
Lee University, has written
another novel concerning the
life of a Lexington resident.

Entitled ‘“‘The Diary of Jack
Campbell,’’ Dr. Turner’s book
describes the World War I ex-
perience of a man who was both
a resident of Lexington and a
student at Washington and Lee.
Using diaries that Campbell
kept, Dr. Turner describes the
adventures that Campbell ex-
perienced while in the military
service from 1918-1919.

Law Forum Hosts Schewel

The Tucker Law Forum will
host a visit from Stanford
Schewel, a New York entertain-
ment lawyer, on April 5 and 6.

Schewel, a 1940 W&L Law
School graduate, served with
the OSS in Egypt, Ethiopia and
Palestine from 1942 to 1945. He

was also vice counsel and
economic analyst in the United

States diplomatic service, serv-

ing as financial attache to the
U.S. Consulate General in
Amsterdam from 1945 to 1946.

Schewel has also been an
assistant to John W. Davis.
Davis was, according to
Schewel, one of America’s
great lawyers and one of the
most famous W&L Law School
graduates.

On April 5 at 8:00 p.m. in
Classroom C of the Law School,
Schewel will lecture on ‘The
Development of Federalism in
the United States.” This lecture.

is a summary and update of a
monograph he wrote while
assisting Davis, then a member
of the Hoover Commission (The
Commission on the Organiza-
tion of the Executive Branch of
Government).

The monograph, which focus-
ed on the development of state
and national powers in the
United States and conflicts be-
tween them, was subsequently
published by the Commission on
Intergovernmental Relations.
Schewel’s monograph on
governmental powers was
highly acclaimed. It was
designated -‘‘must reading” for
the Council of State Govern-
ments, and was highly praised
by Milton S. Eisenhower and
Herbert Hoover.

“In our current political
climate, there is no more timely
topic. The question of what is
our new federalism or our old

federalism, and where it is all
leading, is the subject of lively
discussion in today’s politics,
and I feel it would be an ap-
propriate topic for discussion
among legal scholars.”

On April 6 at 11:00 a.m. in the
Moot Court Room, Schewel will
briefly discuss and answer
questions concerning his enter-
tainment law practice. Enter-
tainment law entails mostly
contract and tax work and his
discussion will focus on tax
strategies for entertainment
personalities.

Schewel has practiced enter-
tainment law in New York for
twenty years. Some of the per-
sonalities he has represented in-
clude: Lauren Bacall, Lee
Remick, Gloria Swanson,
Eileen Brennan, Dick Gregory,
the Smothers ‘Brothers, Abe
Vigoda, Charles Nelson Reilly,
George Segal, Bob and Ray,
Totie Fields, and many others.

 

Generally Speaking -

(continued from page 4)
Track and Field

One word to describe the
Washington and Lee track and
field squad would be ‘‘young.”’
Another would be “potential.”

Most collegiate teams are led
by juniors and seniors, but that
is not the case for the W&L
squad, although upperclassmen
do make sizeable contributions.
However, the top stars for the
Generals after three meets ap-
pear to be freshmen Chris
Busbee, Chris Ives, Scott
Henderson, and Mark Pem-
broke and sophomores Angus
McBryde, Charlie Alcorn and
Kevin Kadesky.

Senior Greg Branan and
junior Alan Armitage are also
giving consistent performances
in their events, the 5000-meter

  

 

run and the 1l0-meter hurdles,
respectively.

This squad, with a little more
depth in the field events, could
truly be awesome in two years,
and‘ they’re not too bad right
now with a 4-0 record.

Baseball

Washington and Lee has
never been particularly noted
for its baseball teams, but this
year may be an exception. Com-
ing off their first ODAC tourna-
ment appearance, coach Jim
Murdock’s Generals bolted to a
4-2 start before becoming mired

_ in a slump that had dropped

their record to 46 prior to
yesterday’s matchup with Col-
gate.

The Generals do play a con-
siderable number of Division I
teams, however, and they have

CABBAGE MAN — Gus Barlow of Glasgow proudly displays the
seven pound head that won his first place in the cabbage competi-
tion. Gus and his wife, Dottie Sue, grew the tumescent wonder in
their annual garden, and neither of them noticed it for months, hid-
den as it was by the plastic tub the Bariows use everry fall to clean
hog guts. Gus is looking forward to the mounds of cooked cabbage
from this single vegetable, although Dottie Sue was less en-
thusiastic at the prospect.

 

GREATAH TOMATAH — This three-pound beauty was grown by
Emma Lu Fishbreath in the garden she raises annually outside

When this publication an-
nounced last year that it would
hold a vegetable look-alike con-
test, it was not expected that so
many people would enter. But
they did, and as you can see
from the pictures on this page
the results were amazing.

Most of the vegetables were
brought in late last August and
publication of the pictures has
been witheld until now. The win-
ners received no prizes other
than the pleasure of having
their pictures and vegetables
printed on this page.

The paper would like tothank
everyone who entered the con-
tests and regrets that not
everyone could get their pic-
tures in the paper.

EC Will.
Examine

Bank Rules

by John Cleghorn

After reviewing a report from
the Cold Check Committee, the
Executive Committee moved to
begin informing incoming
freshmen about local banks’
policies towards bounced
checks in a short meeting Mon-
day night.

In other business the E.C.
commended the editors and
staff of the Washington and Lee
Political Review on its first
publication and also froze the
finances of the Fencing Club,
the Computer Club, and the Stu-
dent Emergency Loan Commit-
tee until their monthly reports
are heard.

Upon inquiry from senior
Law Rep. Morgan Griffith
about students’ awareness of
local banks’ penalties for cold
checks, Cold Check Committee
Treasurer Randall Jacoby
replied that many freshmen are
ignorant of the workings of a
checking account.

“‘T think it would be helpful to
freshmen in understanding
each bank’s policy. They don’t
understand that they have to
pay the banks as a penalty,”’
Jacoby commented.

Senior Rep. Ken Lang then
moved that a policy statement
be included in the package for
incoming freshmen. Executive
Committee Secretary Bennett
Ross remarked that cold checks
are a matter concerning the
bank and the student and that

responsibility lies with the bank“

to inform the freshmen. After a
short explanation by Griffith,
E.C. President Eric Myers sug-
gested that the banks be ap-
proached about the matter.

Senior Rep. Tripp Brower
asked Jacoby if there were
many second offenders. Jacoby
responded that there were only
a few and added that no revision
needed to be made in the cold
check policy.

Eric Myers remarked, “I
think it’s great,” referring to
the first issue of the Washington
and Lee Political Review.

W&L Applications Set New Record

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity received a record number
of applications for admission to
the university this year, accord-
ing to admissions officials.

As of April 2, Washington and
Lee’s office of admissions had
processed 1,602 applications
from prospective students.
Before this year, the largest
number of applications had
been in 1965 when the university
received 1,599 applications.

The total of 1,602 applications
represents a 17 percent in-
crease over a year ago when the
university processed 1,369 ap-
plications.

William M. Hartog, director
of admissions at W&L, said the
university has offered admis-
sion to 765 (or 48 percent) of the
applicants. The university
plans to enroll a freshman class
of between 350 and 365 students
this fall.

Hartog added that the univer- ~

sity has a ‘‘significantly
stronger pool of acceptances”’
in terms of academic quality as
measured both by achievement
and aptitude test scores and by

_ daily academic records.

The average class standing
among students who were ad-
mitted is higher than a year
ago, said Hartog. The average
class standing for those offered
admission is in the 82nd percen-

       
   

tile.

The mean Scholastic Aptitude
Test scores are up 20 points
from a year ago to 564 verbal
and 611 mathematics. In addi-
tion, the students accepted this
year have scored 17. points
higher on the English achieve-
ment test than last year.

“To date, we have named 12
National Merit Scholars and an-

William M. Hartog: ‘‘a significantly stronger pool of acceptances.”

ticipate that between 25 and 30
will be named in all,’’ Hartog
said.

Of the students accepted for
admission at Washington and
Lee, 60 percent are attending
public high schools while 40 per-
cent are attending private high
schools. Forty-four states are
represented among the 765
students offered admission.

Tuesday night, resumed its tus-
sle over the continuing debate
of ‘‘deferred rush,” a subject
which has drawn the interests
of the University Council and
Student Affairs Committee and
Executive Committee.

Dean Dan Murphy, assistant
dean of students for fraternity
affairs, indicated the sugges-
tions were made at the Student

‘Affairs Committee meeting
held just prior to Spring break.
Those proposals concerned in-
tensifying a shortened first
semester rush which would be
proceded by an extensive orien-
tation period for all freshmen.
In addition to greater open con-
tact between freshmen and
fraternity members, this inten-
sive early rush would, it is

Will Sigma Nu
Come Back?....p.3

 

hoped, relieve much of the
monotony which many believe
afflicts the present system.
Murphy said that the Student
Affairs Committee finds it
favorable to “get it (rush) over
with’’ as soon as possible, and
that these changes would allow
that quick termination.

The IFC itself is taking no fur-
ther action on any possible
changes with the rush system
until after hearing the results of
the next Student Affairs Com-
mittee meeting which will take
place on April 29. A general
solution is expected to be made
concerning next year’s rush at
that meeting. /

Other factors which weigh
considerably on any final deci-
sion entail the financial burden
placed upon the fraterntities
during rush, as well as the
academic burden on freshmen
and all students. However,
time, perhaps, is the greatest
obstacle in solving the deferred
rush issue. With just over a
month remaining in the
academic year, a decision must
be finalized soon.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Single Sanction

The letter found at the bottom of this page deals
with a rather touchy subject — the single sanction
policy of the Washington and Lee honor system. Opin-
ions on the single sanction rule run in either direction.
Those who believe in it — the belief that a person gets
only one choice if convicted of an honor offense _
— claim that single sanction serves as a deterrent of*
sorts for would-be honor abusers. Threaten the people
with involuntary expulsion, they argue, and no one
will cheat. But those who disagree with single sanc-
tion state that sometimes we should forgive our fellow
students for honor violations and permit them to re-'
main in the community.

Obviously, the single sanction rule 1s a complicatea
matter. While automatic expulsion does seem an ef-
fective deterrent for cheaters, it is also frightening to
consider the consequences of convicting a person on a
questionable honor offense. But under the system at
Washington and Lee, we theoretically give the stu-
dent at least one fair hearing — the option for a se-
cond hearing is also possible. This,in theory, should
guarantee defendents of a fair hearing.

Over the past few years, there seems to have been
an increase in the amount of students going public
with their honor trials. Whether this is a reflection of
students questioning the effectiveness of the Ex-
ecutive Committee to conduct a private honor hear-
ing, or whether it reflects students enjoying a
democratic process, we are not really sure. Of one
thing we are sure, however. When discussing the
single sanction rule, it is best not to either simply ad-

-vocate or lampoon it. The matter is too complicated to
try and place under narrow limitations.

Sunday, April 25, matks the
first International Day at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty. The event will be sponsored
by the Washington and Lee In-
ternational Club.

First on the agenda for Sun-
day is a Chinese Opera perfor-
mance at the Unviersity
Theatre. The pertérmance
starts at 3 p.m. and reserva-
tions can be made by calling.
463-9111, ext. 299. Chinese opera
is a traditional type of drama
and, as a rule, follows a folklore
theme. Professor I-Hsiung Ju of
the art department was in-
strumental in bringing the
opera to the W&L campus. The
opera will be the first of its Kind’
at Washington and Lee, and is a

rare opportunity to witness an
ancient Chinese art form.

The opera will be performed
by the Chinese Opera Society of
Washington, D.C. The perfor-
mance is entitled ‘“‘The White
Serpent’” and tells of a woman
who turns into a serpent and the
man who falls in love with her
not knowing she is a snake.

The opera will be followed by
an ‘International Dinner” to be
served at Evans Dining Hall.
The dinner will be served from
5:30-6:30 p.m. and will cost $5
for non-contract students.

Following the dinner, a slide
lecture will be presented in the
University Library’s Northen
Auditorium at 8 p.m. The lec-
ture is entitled ‘On the Road in

China, November 1981 - March,
1982: a Historian’s Observa-
tions.” The lecture will be given
by Dr. Roger B. Jeans, a W&L
professor of history. A recep-
tion will follow with interna-
tional hors d’oeuvres being
served.

The club is also presenting an
International Children’s Art
Exhibit. The exhibit will be on
display from April 25-30 in the
University Library’s Lower
Level One lobby.

Henry Baey, president of the
club, commented that ‘‘the day
will hopefully provide some
awareness of different natures
and cultures. We hope many
students will be able to attend.
If it turns out well, we hope to
make it an annual event.”’

W&L Opens Up To Summer Scholars

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will offer .a.month-long co-
educational program designed
to give college-bound high
school students the opportunity
to sample college life again this
summer,

“Summer Scholars 82”” will .
be held July 4 through July 30 on
the Washington and Lee cam-
pus in Lexington.

This is the second summer in

a row Washington and Lee has
conducted the program that in-
volves a rigorous, college-level
academic curriculum for
students who will be seniors in
high school this fall.

Dr. John F. DeVogt, pro-
fessor of administration at
W&L, is the director of the pro-
gram.

During the four-week period,
participants will take two

academic courses that they
choose from among 12 offer-
ings. The courses include such
topics as ‘Battles and Leaders
of the Civil War,” ‘Current
Concepts in Biology,’’ ‘‘Infla-
tion,” “Effective Writing,’ and
“The Media, The Law and
Society.”’

Applications should be made
by May 1.

Single Sanction Policy Questioned

Dear Sir:

Having a few minutes to
spare, I sat down at my desk
this morning to read a while
from a copy of Excelsior, the
newly established journal of
FOCUS. The first article I read
was ‘‘Honor and Will’ by John
Vlahoplus and, while I con-
tinued reading other articles, in

_ the back of my mind was the
desire to respond to John’s let-
ter, and thus this letter.

The article deals with the
honor system at Washington
and Lee and supports the
necessity of continuing a single
sanction system. If a student is
found guilty of an honor offense,
this system requires him to
sever his relationship with the
university. John states that
“honor cannot be measured by
degree’”’ because such a position
would make honor a relative
pursuit. On the contrary, John
believes very clearly that honor
“cannot exist beside dishonor”
and that the tolerance of even
the most insignificant act of
dishonor would jeopardize the
entire system of trust which we
enjoy as Washington and Lee
gentlemen.

While I have the greatest
respect for John, I cannot help
but object to the unbending
principle which he espouses. As
much as it pains me to admit
the fact, I have suffered from
that “failure of will’? which
John identifies as the root of
dishonorable action. A case in
point comes to mind that, while
not having occured at Wash-
ington and Lee, I think may pro-
ve helpful in illustrating my

position.

Some five or six years ago I
was visiting my grandparents
on their in Southern Virginia.
One morning my Grandmother
gave me the keys to her car and
asked me to pull it out of the
garage for her in order to fill the
gasoline tank. Unfortunately, I
was so intent on looking over
my shoulder that I neglected
the front of the car while back-
ing up and ended by smashing
the front fender against the side
of the garage. Well, needless to
say, I was in a state of shock
and terror at what I had done
and was sure that punishment
would be swift and severe. On
the contrary, my Grandmother
upon discovering what occured
comforted me and told me to
simply let it pass. She even
made me promise that I would
not call home and tell my
parents what I had done.

That may have been the end
of the incident, however I con-
tinued to feel badly at having
damaged my Grandparent’s
property. The next day, I
telephoned my parents and told
them (what I had been think-
ing) that they could pay for the
damage and | in turn could
repay them. Of course, my
Grandmother quickly found out
that I had broken my promise to
her and was not a little displeas-
ed. But what did she do?

She could have made me
leave the farm never to return
because I had lied to her, had
violated her honor. Instead, she
again forgave me and com-
forted me. I have never again
even told a “white lie” to my
Grandmother and since that
harrowing episode have en-

joyed many fine days on the
farm. I committed an act of
dishonor against my Grand-
mother, but instead of
banishing me from her sight,
she acted upon General Lee’s
admonition that a gentleman,
or gentlewoman, ‘‘Can not only
forgive, he can forget.”’

The Christian scriptures tell
us that when Peter inquired un-
to Jesus how many times he
must forgive his brother, Jesus
replied ‘‘seventy times seven’’
(Matthew 18:22). My Grand-
mother forgave me and while I
am certainly a humbler man for
having sinned against her, I

 

also believe that I am a
stronger man for having
forgiven and loved.

John said that “honor cannot
exist beside dishonor.”” When I
embrace my forgiving Grand-
mother, I greatly wonder of this
is the case. To be permanently
ostracized, albeit privately,
from any community for a
weakness of willl is a terrible
punishment. It is a punishment
that I am not so sure that we as
gentlemen can or should exer-
cise.

Sincerely,
Keith E. Goretzka ’83

 

 

 

 
 

Cadets from the combined Ar-
my ROTC programs of Wash-
ington and Lee University and
Lynchburg College trained
under sub-freezing conditions in
late March with the Tactics
Committee, 80th Training Com-
mand of Virginia’s 80th, ‘‘Blue
Ridge’”’ Division. The exercise,
part of the continuing series of
W&L’s Total Army training ef-
forts, involved cadets, Army
Reservists, Regular Army
cadre, Army National Guard
training support, and DA
civilians at the Fort Pickett, VA
training site. The FTX,
ominously code named ‘‘Winter
Storm,’’ involved several
phases of training. Even the
logistical and administrative
aspects of the venture served to
educate basic program cadets
who had never before lived in
military barracks, observed the
requirements of a_ training
schedule and weapons security,
or partaken of Army ‘‘chow.”’

The actual training com-
menced on Saturday, March 27,
at 4:30 a.m. when the entire
contingent of 60 cadets formed
for cadre-led physical condi-
tioning. After calesthentics, a
two mile run, and clean up, the
now awake cadets filed into the
80th’s field dining facility for
breakfast. By 0730, twelve M113
armored personnel carriers
(APC’s) had transported the
cadets to a field location where
they commenced training under
| the veteran USAR instructors.

Cleveland

Gaines Cleveland, a second-
year law student at Washington
and Lee University from Gulf-
port, Miss., has been named
editor-in-chief of the
“Washington and Lee Law
Review’? for the 1982-83
academic year.

The editorial board selected
Cleveland and other members
of the 1982-83 staff last week. All
are second-year students in the
School of Law at W&L.

Exercises Conducted

Squads of cadets rotated
through training stations which
included individual tactical
skills, movement techniques,
mechanized infantry squad
drills, and even some tracked
vehicle maintenance _instruc-
tion. All of this was in prepara-
tion for the main events: night
and day operations by a
mechanized infantry unit, per-
forming attacks and defense.

W&L’s Cadet Ranger element
mounted its APC and “‘led the
way”’ for the force which would
conduct delay and defensive
operations. After the five tracks
of the defenders had rumbled
off, the attacking cadets
mounted their vehicles and pro-
ceeded into ‘enemy territory.”
The engagement was _ punc-
tuated with mounted and dis-
mounted ambushes and fire-
fights, attempts at bypass and
envelopment, and sharp skir-
mishes employing fire and
movement by both sides. The
staccato bursts of automatic
weapons, explosive simulators,
smoke grenades, and the whine
and roar of the vehicle engines
all added to the realism.

The final phase of the
weekend’s training on Sunday
was a practical one in which
teams of cadets cleaned and
cleared billets, cleaned rifles
and machine guns, and learned

Basing his optimism on what
he calls ‘‘triad’’ of support, Cap-
tain Charles Hill, the faculty ad-
viser of the Lambda chapter of
Sigma Nu, hopes that the frater-
nity will be reestablished before
the former members graduate,
a goal that he says is rarely ac-
complished among fallen
fraternities.

The “‘triad,”’ which Capt. Hill
speaks of is made up of
assistance from the University,
the National chapter, and the
generosity of Sigma Nu alumni.

“The University gives the
fraternities just enough rope to
either pull themselves up or
hang themselves,’’ maintains
Hill in describing the latitude of
respect between the school and
the fraternities which Hill says
has been fundamental in the
reorganization of the fraternity.

Other assistance has come
from a major fund drive by the
alumni which is raising money
to repair damage to the house
outside of the November fire.
Hill is optimistic that the na-
tional chapter insurance will
pay for the fire damage which is
just under $25,000. The present
stipulation is that no one will
live in the house until the
damage is repaired.

Currently a recruiting team
from the national chapter here
in Lexington is interviewing
students who are interested in

During the next few weeks
Washington and Lee students
will be watching Shakespeare’s
plays being performed at Strat-
ford, England, by the Royal
Shakespeare Company,
studying French grammar in
the shadow of the Cathedral of
Notre Dame.

All that — and more — will oc-
cur as part of Washington and
Lee’s series of spring term
abroad programs.

In all, five different groups of
W&L students will be in Europe
this month and next.

The first university group on
the continent will be Wash-
ington: and Lee’s Glee Club,
which left Saturday (April 10)
for a nine-day tour of Germany.

The 35-member Glee Club,
directed by Gordon Spice, per-
formed three concerts during
the tour, appearing at the
Catholic University of
Eichstatt, the Schlosskirche
(Royal Church in the Old Cas-
tle) near Bayreuth, and the
University of Bamberg.

In addition, Glee Club
members visited Munich and
Wurzburg during the visit.

Four Washington and Lee
professors will be taking stu-
dent groups to Europe for
studies as part of the universi-
ty’s six-week spring term
abroad programs.

George Ray, professor of
English, and eight W&L
students will be in England,
where they will concentrate
their studies on British drama

the six weeks will be spent in
London. Students will live in a
bed-and-breakfast hotel within
walking distance of the Univer-
sity of London, University Col-
lege of London, and the West
End theatre district. In addition
to regularly-scheduled semi-
nars, the students will see
numerous plays, including
several by the Royal Shakes-
peare Company during their
Stay.

Two of the six weeks will be
spent touring by mini-bus in
various parts of England, Wales
and Scotland.

Robert Youngblood, associate
professor of German, will have
12 students in Germany during
the spring term. Headquartered
in Bayreuth where they will live
in homes with German families,
the students will receive in-
struction in Germany from both
Dr. Youngblood and members
of the University of Bayreuth
faculty.

G. Francis Drake, professor
of romance languages and 11
students will spend the spring
term in France. The students
will live-in private homes in
Paris and will attend classes in
French, contemporary French
theatre, and contemporary
French art.

C. Westbrook Barritt, pro-
fessor of romance languages,
will have eight students in Spain
for the spring term. The
students will attend classes five
days a week in Madrid where
they will live in private homes.

Improving Netters
Face ‘Challenge’

by David Stuart

“We played as well as we
could,’”’ said Washington and
Lee tennis coach Gary Franke
of his team’s effort on last
week’s Florida road trip.

The team won two matches
against Eckerd (8-1) and Stet-
son (5-4) Colleges but dropped
three matches to Emory (6-3),
University of Central Florida
(9-0) and Rollins (9-0). The
team has never beaten Emory
but has always played them im-
mediately following exams.

In a match Tuesday against
Virginia Tech in Blacksburg,
the Generals took two matches
by default but it wasn’t enough
as they lost 7-2. The match was
played on fast-paced indoor
courts that VPI used to their ad-
vantage. Franke said the
Hokies’ ‘‘kicking serves’’ on the
fast courts gave the varsity ad-
ded problems in adjusting to the
new surface.

The team’s record is now 6-13,
but all of the losses, except that
to Emory, have been to Division
I or Division II teams. The im-
portant matches to decide the
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference ranking have yet to be
played. The squad will face a
tough Hampden-Sydney squad
today and Lynchburg Friday on
the road.

Franke said that Hampden-
Sydney and Lynchburg are a
“real challenge’ and ‘‘we need
to be on the top of our game”’ to
beat both teams. Improvement,
rather than just wins and
losses, is what Franke
measures progress with, and he
saw it plus a few victories on the
Florida trip.

American Craig Perry of
Rollins before losing 6-4, 4-6, 6-1.

Wes Yonge, number two on
the team, won a crucial second-
set tiebreaker after dropping
the first set 6-1 and went on to
win in Washington and Lee’s 5-4
defeat of Stetson College at
DeLand, Florida.

Charlie Kalocsay and Jim-Ir-
win (numbers three and four)
played well but singles victories
were scarce as each posted only
one win.

Freshman Andy Haring
(number five) continues to be a
consistent winner as he won two
hairpullers in split sets, 7-6, 4-6,
6-3, at Stetson and 3-6, 7-5, 6-4 at
Emory. Classmate Stephen
Bendheim suffered much the
same fate as Kalocsay and Ir-
win in singles, but it was a dif-
ferent story in doubles.

The doubles pair of Haring
and Bendheim won three big
matches and had close losses to
the University of Central
Florida and Rollins.

Baseball Snaps Slump

by Andrew P. Hoppes

The Washington and Lee
baseball team broke out of a
disasterous mid-season slump
last week to win three league
games before losing to
nationally-ranked Lynchburg
on Tuesday.

After losing two games to
Hampden-Sydney and one to
Eastern Mennonite, the
Generals rebounded to destroy ,
Mennonite 17-0 and Maryville
twice, 5-3 and 5-4. While raising
their league record to 4-5 at that
point, W&L played three
straight games without com-
mitting an error and raised
their team batting average 30
points.

In the 7-6 and .4-3 losses to
Hampden-Sydney, the Generals

Golfers 7th At Va. Tech

by B. Scott Tilley

While most of the student
body relaxed over spring break
at home or at the beach, the
Washington and Lee golf team
was facing a tough field in the
Virginia Tech ‘‘Gobbler
Classic’’ in Blacksburg, Va.

Led by seniors Titus Harris
and Jim Kaplan, with 36-hole
scores of 149, the team placed

Virginia (Arlington) Chargers
in Lynchburg. Their first
regular season game will be on
May 29.

A 1962 graduate of Syracuse,
Fallon, who has a 20-20 record
in four years at Washington and
Lee, played with the Minnesota
Vikings for one season and then
spent two years in the Canadian
Football League. Before com-
ing to Lexington, he was an
assistant coach at Princeton for
six years.

Fallon’s contract calls for
him to receive a base salary of
¢2,500 plus 5 percent of the home
gate receipts. There are some
additional attendance and per-
formance incentives in the con-

watt: {

   

seventh out of the 15 teams
entered.

Whit Kelly’s 156, Del Agnew’s —

158, Bruce Blythe’s 161 and Bill
Alfano’s 163 also helped the
strong second-day perfor-
mance, after the Generals were
bogged in tenth place following
the first day.

The Generals had suffered a
two-and-a-half week layoff
since defeating Bluefield Col-
lege to raise their dual match
record to 6-0, and Coach Buck
Leslie felt that this ‘‘hurt the
team in the first round at Tech.
I was really pleased that we
came around the second day.
We shot the second lowest round
the second day, which beat a lot
of Division I teams.”’

The team now heads to
Hampden-Sydney College Mon-
day and Tuesday to compete in
the ODAC tournament at
Wedgewood Country Club in
Farmville.

Coach Leslie sees this year’s
tournament as a free-for-all.
“It’s wide open because nearly
every team has played well and
played fairly even so far this
season. I don’t believe anyone
will be able to run away from
the rest of the field. It will be a
close, well-fought tournament.”’

led both times late in the game
before the Tigers rallied.

Coach Jim Murdock noted,
“If we could have called back
three or four pitches in those
games we would have won.”’

The Generals finally ended
their slump in the second game
of a doubleheader with Men-
nonite after losing the opener
8-7. “We got a little irate and
came out and bopped them,”’
observed Murdock.

 

Sports

 

W&L played a near-perfect
game in the nightcap, ripping 19
hits and getting shutout pitch-
ing from Jim Brockelman and
Jim Stanley. Thad Ellis and
Jody Harris crushed homers for
the Generals. ‘‘Even the
substitutes got a couple of runs
against them,’’ said Murdock.
The squad also played well in
their 5-3 win in the first game of
the double header against
Maryville. Rich Hachenberg
pitched well in picking up the
win.

In the second game of the
doubleheader, the Generals
held a solid 3-1 lead, but then
made some costly mistakes to
allow the Scots to tie the contest
at 3-3. At that point, a heavy
downpour forced suspension of
the game until the next day

However, the wait was worth-
while for W&L. After a Chris
Cavalline double, a Jeff Hag-
gerty single and a walk to Kevin
Golden, Dave Warrenfeltz rip-
ped a two-run single to give the
Generals an exciting 5-4 win.

In Tuesday’s 3-2 heartbreak-
ing loss to Lynchburg, the
Generals took a 2-0 lead but
could not hold off a late inning
rally by the Hornets, the peren-
nial ODAC champion and cur-
rently ranked third in Division
Ill.

Jody Harris started a two-run
first inning for W&L with a
sharp single to center. After a
Thad Ellis walk, Mike Walsh
forced him at second, but
Lynchburg threw the ball away
trying to get Walsh, allowing
Harris to score. Jeff Haggerty
knocked in the other W&L run
with a groundout.

Lynchburg tied the score with
single runs in the fifth and sixth
innings off reliever Dave Ran-
dall. He had replaced starter
Billy White, who left the game

Generally Speaking :

But What About
The Other Game?

by G. Bruce Potter

Just in case you forgot, the Washington and Lee lacrosse team
did play two games last week.

Oh, sure, everyone knows they lost to the University of Virginia
22-8 in Charlottesville on Sunday, But they also eased by the College
of William and Mary in the historical town of Williamsburg last
Tuesday by a count of 15-10.

After jumping out to a quick 3-0 lead early in the first period, it
looked as though the Generals also forgot about a battered William
and Mary squad and began looking ahead to Sunday’s match-up
with the Cavaliers.

The Indians came back to tie the score at three and then played
W&L even until the Generals scored four consecutive goals to turn
a slim 8-7 lead into a safe 12-7 advantage midway through the fourth
stanza.

Yet, there was very little doubt as to which team was the best on
this overcast, windy afternoon. The Generals virtually dominated
the game at both ends of the field but made some very crucial ex-
ecution mistakes that kept the contest close. Their domination is
emphasized by the fact that they won 21 of 28 faceoffs and picked up
60 of 93 groundballs. : :

Poor passing by the Generals and some outstanding goaltending
by Indian goalie Randy Duke also helped keep the game a game, if
that’s what you want to call it. For example, early in the fourth
quarter, Barry Waterman broke clear down the middle and fired a
point-blank shot at Duke, only to have the Indian goalie make an in-
credible save.

However, the ball remained inthe Generals’ possession and
Waterman found himself virtually alone in the middle again, but
dropped a centering pass, and the Indians recovered the ground
ball.

Washington and Lee goalie Ware Palmer twice tried to be a hero
himself by keeping the ball and racing down the field. The first
time, he was preparing to take a shot from about ten yards when
the ball was stolen from him from behind. The second time, late in:
the game, he didn’t even make it to midfield before having the ball
knocked out of his stick and the Indians score a goal before he could
get back to the net.

Surprisingly, Washington and Lee also dominated in an area they
don’t usually dominate — the fans. Even though the game was in
Williamsburg, there were at least as many W&L fans as William
and Mary fans. Then again, how can you blame the William and
Mary fans when their team has a 2-9 record?

But some of the Indian fans, aided by a couple of six-packs,
became rather boisterous. Midway through the third quarter, with
the Generals holding an 8-4 lead, one commented, “I wish W&L
would hurry up and score. I predicted they would get 15 goals — in
the first half.”

Later, another fan gave Washington and Lee the name “W and H-
ll : ”

After several consecutive Washington and Lee mistakes in the
fourth quarter, the same fan yelled, “You guys-don’t stand a
chance against Virginia on Sunday!”’

To which, a W&L fan retorted, “At least we play Virginia.”

Defending champion and top-
ranked North Carolina will
come to town this Saturday to
take on the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team at 2 p.m. on
Wilson Field.

Coach Willie Scroggs’ ex-
plosive team features several
All-Americans, including mid-
fielders Doug Hall and Kevin
Griswold, attackman Mike
Burnett and junior goalie Tom
Sears.

The Generals anticipate that
a large turnout, perhaps in ex-
cess of 5,000, will be on hand to
support W&L as it challenges
the number one team in the na-
tion. Two years ago, the
Tarheels attracted 6,000 fans to
Wilson Field for a 7-5 victory
over the Generals.

W&L head coach Jack Em-
mer acknowledges that it will
take a strong combination of
vocal support from the student
body as well as a supreme effort
by his team to keep pace with
UNC. “It’s not often you get to
play the top team on your own

field. Hopefully, we’ll get a good
crowd. We’re looking forward
to giving it our best shot,”’ said
Emmer.

Over the break, the Generals
had matches at William and
Mary Tuesday and Virginia
Sunday.

W&L was a heavy favorite
against the William and Mary
Indians and put 51 shots on goal
but nevertheless was held in
check before the Generals
notched the last two goals for a
15-10 win.

At Charlottesville, the third-
ranked Cavaliers were in the
favorite’s role. The final
margin (22-8, UVA) was not ex-
pected, however, especially in
light of the intense rivalry bet-
ween the two schools.

With Ray Guisto accounting
for two of the first three goals,
the Cavaliers led 4-0 after 12
minutes. The score was 10-1 six
minutes into the second
quarter, and things never got
much better for W&L, whose
record fell to 6-2.

At halftime, Virginia held a

 

12-2 bulge and U.Va. coach Jim
(Ace) Adams gave goalie J.B.
Meyer (seven saves) the rest of
the afternoon off.

In all, 15 different players
scored for the. Cavaliers. The
Guistos, Ray and Rick, each ac-
counted for three goals. Matt
Rainis, Mike Carvana, and
freshman Jeff Nicklas had two
apiece as U.Va. built its record
to 5-2.

The Cavaliers excelled in
every department, including
Shots (54-33), ground balls
(63-46), only losing in faceoffs
(18-16, W&L). The Cavs forced
the Generals into numerous
ballhandling mistakes, taking
W&L out of its offense and leav-
ing the Lexington contingent at
Scott Stadium stunned.

There wasn’t much for
General fans to cheer about
once Ray Guisto opened to scor-
ing at 4:08 with a hard, rising
25-footer. Virginia had excep-
tional success beating W&L
goalie Ware Palmer from long
range.

Emmer recalled Palmer in
favor of sophomore Phil Aiken
four minutes into the second
quarter when the count had
already reached 9-1. Palmer
came back to start the second
half then left for good with six
minutes to go in the game. He
allowed 14 goals and was
credited with nine saves.

At the other end of the field, it
took a couple of excellent in-
dividual efforts to get the ball
by Meyer.. Rich Schoenberg
converted a loose ball in front of
the net into W&L’s first goal.
John Sancilio dodged his
defender in the midfield for the
second.

Sancilio and John Doub
scored a pair of goals each for
the Generals, but the Cavaliers’
tough close defense held the
W&L attack to unassisted goals
by Lee Heimert and Mike
Schuler. The team’s leading
scorer coming into the game,
Rob Staugaitis, was limited to
one assist.

Private Art Collection
On Display In Dupont

An exhibition of paintings,
prints, and drawings from the
private collection of Ralph
Grant opened yesterday in the
duPont Gallery on _ the
Washington and Lee University
campus.

The exhibition continues
through May 9. DuPont Gallery
is open to the public without
charge weekdays from 9 a.m. to
5 p.m., Saturdays from 11 a.m.
to 3 p.m., and Sundays from 2
p.m. to4p.m.

Grant is a designer for the
carpet division of Burlington In-
dustries. He lives in Lexington.

Grant’s collection includes
works by internationally known
artists as well as a series of
works by Philadelphia artists
and another group of works by

artists from the Lexin area.
“The show at duP will in-
clude several differen. groups:
photographs, op-art, land-
scapes, and some figurative
works,’’ Grant explained.

‘‘A show such as this is an ex-
cellent opportunity in that it
opens a private collection up for
public viewing and makes it
possible to share the works with
a much wider audience,”’ Grant
added.

This is the second exhibition
in a series of annual shows
based on the works from local
and area art collectors. Last
year works from the collection
of Washington and Lee

Public Speaking Professor

Awarded Summer Grant

Dr. Halford R. Ryan,
associate professor of public
speaking at Washington and
Lee University, has been
awarded a research grant from
the Maurice L. Mednick
Memorial Fund for study this
summer.

The Mednick Memorial Fund
is administered by the Virginia
Foundation for Independent
Colleges (VFIC), a fund-raising
consortium of 12 four-year
private colleges in the state, in-
cluding Washington and Lee.

Ryan will use his Mednick
research grant to pursue
studies at the Lyndon Baines
Johnson Presidential Library in
Austin, Texas.

He plans to conduct research

into President Johnson’s voting
rights speech, which Johnson
delivered to a joint session of
Congress in 1965.

In addition to examining
various drafts of the speech and
the contributions of Johnson’s

. speechwriters to the final pro-

duct, Ryan will view videotapes
to assess Johnson’s delivery
and will investigate reaction to
the speech as indicated by mail
received at the White House.

“Conducting research at the
LBJ Presidential Library is a
superb opportunity since it pro-
vides access to information not
available anywhere else,’’ said
Ryan.

Ryan joined the faculty at
Washington and Lee in 1970. A
graduate of Wabash College

Alum Donates $25,000

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has received a gift of
$25,000 from William M. France
of Lancaster, Ohio, to establish
an endowed scholarship fund in
honor of W&L history professor
Charles W. Turner.

France, a 1958 graduate of
Washington and Lee, is presi-
dent of WHOK, Inc., which

operates WLOH/WHOK, the
radio stations in Lancaster. He
is a past vice president of Socie-
ty National Bank in Cleveland.
Turner joined the Washington
and Lee faculty in 1946. A native
of Fredericks Hall in Louisa
County, Va., Turner received
his B.A. degree from the
University of Richmond

with a master’s degree and a
Ph.D. from the University of Il-
linois, he has recently published
two articles dealing with
presidential addresses. In one,
he examined the fourth in-
augural speech of Franklin D.
Roosevelt; in the other, he ad-
dressed Harry S Truman’s 1951
speech in which Truman spoke
of the dismissal of Gen. Douglas
MacArthur.

The Mednick Memorial Fund
was created in 1976 after the ac-
cidental death of a young Nor-
folk industrialist. His family
and business associates
established the fund to
perpetuate his name and to
recognize his own strong in-
terest in higher education.

The VFIC administers the
fund to encourage professional
development of college
teachers and improve their
competence through grants for
research and advanced study
and to assist highly qualified,
needy students in their upper-
class years in college.

Dr. Roger B. Jeans Jr.,
associate professor of history at
Washington and Lee, used a
grant from the Mednick Fund
for research in China last year.

council and the student body at
Washington and Lee.

The author of several books
and numerous articles describ-
ing his participation in a variety
of sports events, Plimpton’s lec-
ture is entitled ‘““An Amateur
Among Pros.”’

Plimpton is most widely
known for his best-selling book

ROTC Giving Most A’s

by Rick Swagler

According to last year’s
Registrar’s report, the depart-
ments giving the most A’s and
B’s were, in descending order,
Military Science, Drama, and
Art. Departments giving the
least number of A’s and B’s

were, in ascending order,
Greek, Mathematics, and
Sociology.

In the Military Science
Department, 66 percent of the
grades given were A’s. In the
Spring, an astonishing 94 per-
cent of all Military Science
grades were A’s. Thorughout
the year, 95 percent of all the
department’s grades were A’s
or B’s.

The Drama Department gave
50 percent of its students A’s in

the fall, compared to 79 percent
for the winter term and 51 per-
cent in the Spring. The average
of both A’s and B’s for the year
was 91 percent.

The Art Department gave 50
percent of its fall students A’s,
compared to ratios of 28 percent
for the winter term and 80 per-
cent in the Spring. The relative-
ly low number of A’s in the
winter was offset by a high
number of B’s (42 percent). The
average of A’s and B’s in the

‘ Art Department was 82 percent,

which was one point higher than
the Music Department.

At the other end of the scale,
the Greek Department topped
the list for least amounts of A’s
and B’s. The Greek Department

Senior Banquet

Staugaitis And Turner:
The Men Of The Hour

Robert M. Staugaitis, a senior
from Farmingdale, N.Y., and
Dr. Charles W. Turner, a pro-
fessor of history at Washington
and Lee, were the main
honorees at Tuesday night’s
Senior Banquet.

Staugaitis, a lacrosse team
captain and head dormitory
counselor, was given the Frank
Gilliam Award. The Gilliam
Award is presented each year to
the student who has made the
most valuable contibution to
student affairs in one or more
fields.

Dr. Turner, who is retiring
from W&L after 36 years of
teaching, was given the William
W. Pusey Award. The Pusey
Award is presented to a faculty
member who has made outstan-
ding contributions to the univer-
sity.

Six people — three students
and three faculty members
—were given Ring-tum Phi
awards. Staugaitis, Michael P.
Bernot, and Nelson Ould were
the student recipients. Dr.
Turner, Isabel MclIlvain, and
President Robert E.R. Huntley
were the faculty recipients.

In accepting the Gilliam
Award, Staugaitis said he was
deeply touched and ‘‘for once,
speechless.’’ Staugaitis said he
had nothing but fond memories
of the university and his only
regret was ‘‘perhaps not

meeting as many people as [|

could.”’ In returning to the
podium for his Phi Award,
Staugaitis said-he again was
speechless.

Upon receiving the Pusey
Award, Dr. Turner said that he

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

A New Rush?

By the time this editorial has been read, the Univer-
sity Council will likely have decided on a rush format
for next year. As of this writing, the most likely for-
mat would be to turn rush into a shorter process (it
would run only four weeks instead of the usual six).
But another feature would be changed. The earliest
date for tearing (accepting a house’s bid) would be
moved up to only three weeks. What the IFC seems to
be advocating is a more climactic rush. Rather than
dragging the thing over six weeks, the IFC will
shorten it to four, with the drama unfolding in the
third.

 

 

Obviously, the system has strengths and
weaknesses. Freshmen will.be exposed to less of a
runaround, but they will also have to go through a
more intense period of rush. Sadly, rush, under this
format, will probably be the three-ring circus that it is
every year.

One of the negative factors of rush is the pressure
that freshmen encounter not only in tearing, but find-
ing the right house. Many freshmen believe they have
failed if they do not find the right house the first time
around. This new format would only extend this
misconception. If a freshman feels pressured in a six-
week schedule, Lord knows what he’ll feel in a four-
week period. , :

The UC is making the right move in trying to adopt
a new format for rush. We only hope that the new for-
mat will not contain the same flaws that caused
displeasure in the old system.

Currently Being Discussed

 

New Rush , Same Problems

by Scott Mason

It is a grave mistake to underestimate the im-
portance of fraternities. Despite their critics,
fraternities, sentimental as they may seem, serve
to unite men in a common bond of friendship that
is forever enduring.

At Washington and Lee, whose campus boasts 16
fraternities whose members exceed 80 percent of
the student body, the importance of houses
becomes intensely magnified. Generally, those
who are least content with W&L are non-fraternity
members.

With this tremendous emphasis upon frater-
nities, it is vital that a carefully-calculated rush
system which gives freshmen ample opportunity
to examine each house individually be instituted.
Washington and Lee’s present rush system falls
far short of allowing this opportunity...

Upon their arrival to W&L, freshmen become in-
stantly embroiled in the rush melee. Among their
initial perils is registering for fraternity open
house. Immediately, they must eliminate seven of
the existing 16 fraternities they wish to visit.
Equipped with minimal information concerning
the rush system and no information whatsoever as
to the “personalities” of each house, these seven
fraternities are eliminated virtually at random.
One of these unlucky seven may, in the end, be the
perfect house a particular freshman candidate is
seeking. Unfortunately, he may never realize this
much less ever step foot inside its door.

As the free-for-all begins with open houses and
rush dates, fraternities are quick to cloak
themselves in a blanket of illusion. Freshmen are
immediately shelled by a barrage of smiling faces
and friendly handshakes followed by the usual
routine repertoire of questions.

The monotony of rush rapidly takes its toll and
freshmen are “encouraged” to make their ‘deci-
sion as early as possible. During this period when

“pledging”’ is first permitted, most freshmen are

marked targets, converged upon by fraternity
members usually representing various houses.
The pressure becomes tantamount, however,
when a freshman, torn between two or more
houses, is unable to resolve his dilemma while
most others have already been successfully induc-
ed to “tear.” As rush begins to fade and November
approaches, that unresolved freshman often may
make a decision of which he remains uncertain. *

Recently, the rush system has, at last, been
scrutinized and proposals to alter the present
system have surfaced. With only weeks now re-
maining before the termination of the academic’
year, a decision concerning changes in the rush
system seems near at hand. Generally, the com-
bined opinions of the Inter-fraternity Council, the
Student Affairs Committee, and the University
Council are being gathered in order to resolve the
issue.

It appears, however, that they are teetering on
the brink of a disastrous decision which would
severely intensify the very same misfortunes that
freshmen are forced to endure under the present
system. Indeed, instead of resolving the problems
that now afflict the present system, the proposed
decision would magnify these problems.

This resolution, expected to be passed by the
University Council tonight (Thursday), involves
shortening rush from six to four weeks. Whereas
freshmen are now permitted to pledge during the
pledge at the start of approximately the third

week. Preceding this ‘“‘intensivied shortened:
rush” would be an extensive orientation period
designed to acquaint freshmen with the
mechanics of rush and inform them of the rules
and process of the rush system.

The idea of shortening rush is merely a means of
placing quickly an end to the rush process as is
possible, admits the Student Affairs Committee.
In recommending this policy, the committee has

Nostalgia With A Sentiment

As is the case with any affair that involves
either soon-to-be graduates or alumni, the Senior
Banquet was a combination of nostalgia, a few
touching moments, and a smattering of fund rais-
ing. The seniors who chose to attend Tuesday
night’s supper in Evans Dining Hall were treated
to a little recognition for surviving four years of
W&L, and then were given their first dose of dona-
tion requests from the alumni office.

The evening began innocently enough in the
Alumni House, where cocktails at 6, combined
with pre-banquet anxiety and an empty stomach,
left more than a fair share of banqueteers light-
headed. The scene at the alumni house was enough
to bring smiles to the faces of Alvin Carter and
Joseph Bank. Seniors and third-year law students
were clad in blue blazers, solid-color shirts, and
patterned ties. Nothing seems to bring out a crowd
as does an open bar, and the four bartenders in the
Alumni House worked straight from 6-7 p.m.

After being herded across campus to the dining
hall, the banqueteers had to creep through a
security check, where one gargantuan basketball
player peered ominously down on would-be smug-
glers. The dinnner itself was your basic banquet
fare — chicken and rice, with a choice of veggies.
Most students learned of seconds only after most
of the chicken was gone. After approximately 45
minutes of dining and conversation, the festivities
began.

Bill Washburn, alumni secretary, was the
emceee for the evening. Washburn provided the
guests with a few snappy introductions and some
vintage-1940 humor. Washburn introduced the
first speaker, Politics Professor John Handelman,
whose refelctions on W&L were perhaps the
highlight of the evening. Handelman’s speech, a
combination of digs at his fellow professors and an
emphasis on the value of maintaining contact with

the university, was warmly received by the au-
dience.

Speaking next was Dean of Students Lewis John,
who presented the Gilliam Award. The recipient,
senior Rob Staugaitis, gave a humble
“‘speechless’”’ speech in which he praised the
school. It was the first of two trips to the podium
for Staugaitis who later received a Ring-tum Phi
Award.

John Viahoplus, a junior and member of the Ex-
ecutive Committee, next presented the William W.
Pusey Award. The recipient, Dr. Charles W.
Turner, was also a two-time winner as he later
was given a Ring-tum Phi Award. Dr. Turner, ina
rather misty voice, accepted the award with a
brief yet polite response.

The Ring-tum Phi Awards were last on the agen-
da. The Phi’s Editor read, er, announced the
awards, which were given not only to Staugaitis
and Dr. Turner, but also to Mike Bernot, Nelson
Ould, Isabel Mcllvain and W&L President Robert
E.R. Huntley. President Huntley received a two-
minute standing ovation as he accepted the award
and asked the banqueteers to sit down, saying they
were about to ‘‘make a grown man cry.”’ Huntley
did not give a long speech, saying he would save
his comments for June’s graduation ceremonies.

The banquet had come and gone by 8:45, after
Buddy Atkins paid notice to the alumni pamphlet
all diners were given. Somewhere in this speech
was a veiled message of fund-raising, but Atkins,
like other speakers, developed the theme of keep-
ing in touch with the alumni office.

As are most alumni affairs, Tuesday night’s
banquet was slick, orderly and generally en-
joyable. For most seniors, it was a chance to get
together with old friends and remember the good
ole days.

White Hopes For

Minority Increase

by B. Scett Tilley

Despite federal cuts in stu-
dent aid programs and keener
competition in minority recruit-
ing on the national level, Direc-
tor of Minority Affairs John
White is pleased with the quan-
tity and quality of this fall’s
minority class.

In September White had a
potential prospect pool of 144
students, a number he describ-
ed as “deceptive.” From that
pool 24 applications were
received and 12 accepted. White
unofficially expects about nine
of these students to confirm ac-
ceptance, up one from last year,
but down six from the fifteen
black students who enrolled in
the fall of 1980.

White noted that academical-
ly, “this is one of the stronger
minority classes we’ve had.”
The average SAT scores for
those accepted is 480 verbal and
500 math, and the average class
rank is in the 72nd percentile.

The majority of recruitment
of black students takes place
through the Educational

heard monthly reports from the
nine student organizations in-
cluding year-end financial
statements from the Student
Bar Association and the W&L
Fencing Club at its weekly
meeting Monday night. _

Outside of organization
reports, E.C. President Eric
Meyers announced that applica-
tions for positions on the
University Council for the com-
ing year are due next Monday,
May 1. the petitions must be ac-
companied by 50 signatures

| from the student body.

“The year and the money
came out about even,” com-
‘mented Student Bar Associa-
tion Treasurer Christine Chap-
man referring to the allocation
the E.C. gave the S.B.A. at the
beginning of the year. That
report was the last scheduled
one for the S.B.A. as the law
school begins final exams on
May 10. In her final letter ac-
companying her report Chap-
man commented that, ‘‘the
bridge seemed a little shorter
this year, at least from the
perspective of Lewis Hall.”’

Fencing Club David Hepler also
gave his last report to the E.C.
as its season closed with a no-
show by the University of
Virginia with its final record
standing at two wins, four
losses, and three cancellations.
Hepler presented the Club’s
modest budget, closing with ap-
proximately $25 left in the ac-
count and also announced that
one team member, sophomore
Rick Swagler, is still training
for the national competition to
take place June 2.

Junior secretary and presi-
dent-elect of the E.C. Bennett
Ross raised the issue for the
Cold Check Committee that
payment would soon stop on stu-
dent’s bad checks in a move to
save outstanding debts from be-
ing carried over the summer.

After a motion by rep. Morgar

Griffith!, the Committee unan-
imously voted to stop payment
of such checks on Friday, May
14.

Eric Kolts, Chairman of the
Student Emergency Loan Com-
mittee, appeared to present its
monthly report. With fifteen
loans partially or wholly
outstanding, Kolts stated that

Testing Service Minority Stu-
dent Search, through athlete
recruitment, the Black Alumni
Committee, and high school
visitation are also important,
according to White.

White added, ‘‘Nationally,
there has been a decline in the
number of blacks at predom-
inately white schools and a
return to predominately black
campuses. With the cut in stu-
dent aid funds, black schools’
aid programs will also suffer.”

He sees the possibility of an
increase in interest in W&L
though, citing two reasons: a
more concentrated effort by the
University to recruit blacks,
and an increase in financial
awards for minority students
here. Two new grants have been
added this year.

In support of these hopes, he
noted that the preliminary in-
terest search for the class of ’87
exceeds 200 students already,
an all-time high. He hopes to ex-
ceed 40 applications for the first
time, but added that it is ‘‘Un-
predictable, at best.”

reported that seven W&L

sponsored by its literary
magazine, The Brambler.
Trotter also announced that the
spring issue of the Ariel is cur-
rently at the printer and is ex-
pected to be released sometime
between May 1 and May 10.
‘“‘We were pleased that we got
as many items for this issue,”
remarked Trotter, referring to
the large 48 page copy of the

that elections for the editor and

Tennis, Track To Host ODAC Finals

Netmen Are ‘Dark Horse’
Behind H-SC , Lynchburg

by David Stuart

The climax of the 1981 tennis season begins
tomorrow as Washington and Lee hosts seven
other Old Dominion Athletic Conference teams in
the two-day ODAC tournament.

‘“‘We are the dark horse here,”’ admitted head
coach Gary Franke, speaking of his squad’s
chances of capturing the conference title. Franke
figured if two of his six players won their flights,
four were finalists, and at least two won third
place, they could win the event.

The tournament is structured so that the eight
number one players representing each of the
teams will compete against each other, making up
a flight. There will be six singles flights and three
doubles flights in the tourney.

The flight winners earn eight team points, and
each quarterfinalist picks up one point. Three con-
solation rounds are played to decide three and
four, five and six, and seven and eight ranks in the
championship. Of course, the team with the most
cumulative points wins the ODAC title.

Tournament seedings will be decided at a
coaches’ meeting to be held tonight. Washington
and Lee lost to Hampden-Sydney 8-1 and Lynch-
burg 7-2 last week but the final seeding of the top
three contenders could not be determined until
Lynchburg and Hampden-Sydney played a match
yesterday.

Freshman Andy Haring (number five) was the

only General to win a singles match against Lyn-
chburg, thus securing himself at least a number
two seed in the tournament. Coach Franke
remarked that ‘‘Haring is the most capable of any
to win” at the ODAC’s.

In doubles, the number one pair of Craig Cannon
and Charlie Kalocsay were the only W&L winners
against Hampden-Sydney on Thursday. They lost
at Lynchburg, however, so the Hampden-Sydney-
Lynchburg match will decide their seeding.

Conversely, the number two doubles duo of Wes
Yonge and Jim Irwin won against Lynchburg but
lost at H-SC. Franke marks them as a second seed.

What about the other five ODAC teams,
Roanoke, Bridgewater Emory and Henry, Mary-
ville and Randolph-Macon? Maryville is strong
in football and Roanoke in basketball, but in tennis
the “‘strength of the ODAC” lies predominantly
with Washington and Lee, Hampden-Sydney and
Lynchburg.

Though the Generals have only played three
ODAC teams this season, they have consistently
been top contenders for the conference title. This
year, aside from those losses to H-SC and Lynch-
burg, W&L beat Emory and Henry 8-1.

The championship singles finals are scheduled
for 1 p.m. Saturday. The time, however, is subject
to change depending on the length of matches and
the weather.

Losses Kill Baseball’s Tourney Hopes

by Andrew P. Hoppes

W&L’s baseball team
defeated conference rival
Bridgewater, but lost double-
headers to Emory & Henry and
William & Mary this past week.

As of Tuesday, the Generals’
record stood at 8-15 overall and
5-8 in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference.

In order to have qualified for
the ODAC tournament (May 1),
the Generals had to beat Lynch-
burg today and hope for a
Bridgewater loss in their final
game. However, that game was
cancelled and will not be
rescheduled, thus knocking
W&L out of the playoff picture.

Last Wednesday, the
Generals greatly improved
their playoff chances with a 12-9
extra-inning win at Bridge-
water. Senior Rich Hachenberg
pitched the last five innings to
earn the win.

W&L turned in a superb per-
formance offensively with three
three-run innings. Senior Jeff
Haggerty led the attack with

‘four hits and four runs-batted-

in, including a home-run.

One of W&L’s three-run inn-
ings came in the top of the ninth
as the Generals seized the lead,
9-8. Haggerty rapped a key two-
RBI double in the inning.

After Bridgewater tied the

score in the bottom of the ninth,
the Generals won the game with
three runs in the llth. The
Generals took advantage of
several Bridgewater errors in
the inning.

Last Friday, the Generals
traveled to Emory & Henry
where they lost two league con-
tests to the Wasps (4-1 and 13-2).
“We only got seven hits in the
doubleheader,”’ noted W&L
coach Jim Murdock.

In the first game, senior Dave —

Randall yielded only one earned
run. But the weak General hit-
ting hurt Randall. Senior Thad

, W&L Golfers
Take Third

by B. Scott Tilley

The problem of bad first-day
performances once again
reared its ugly head and spelled
defeat for the Washington and
Lee golf team this week in the
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference .championships at
Wedgewood Country Club in
Farmville, Va.

Led by senior co-captains Jim
Kaplan and Bill Alfano, who
each earned all-Conference
honors, the Generals turned in
the best second-day perfor-
mance of the tournament, a 296,
to give them a total of 613 and
third-place in the event, only
two strokes behind champion
Lynchburg.

The Generals turned in a 317
Monday, miring themselves in
fourth place in the six-team
tournament, 14 strokes off the
pace, Roanoke, bidding for its
third straight ODAC title, led by
two strokes after Monday’s ac-
tion but finished with a 309 for a
total of 612, one stroke behind
Lynchburg and one ahead of
W&L.

Generals Meet Syracuse

by John Harrison

Bizarre. Bush league. In-
novative. Garbage. What had to
be done to win.

These were some of the
descriptions used by both sides
following last Saturday’s
lacrosse match on Wilson Field,
in which North Carolina scored
four of the last five goals to
escape with an 11-8 decision.

Earlier in the week head
coach Jack Emmer had said,
‘“‘We’re not going to go out there
and just play the game. We’re
going to try to control the tempo
and use some strategies.”’

This stratagem that kept

fans, players, and coaches from —

both schools talking about the
game was the ‘‘Armadillo’’ for-

eels.

Senior Rob Staugaitis helpea
put W&L ahead 2-0 in the first
five minutes by beating Tom
Sears, a U.S. World Games par-
ticipant, with a high hard shot
and then fed freshman Jeff
Mason with an alert centering
pass which Mason quickly put
behind the Carolina goalie.

Defenseman Dave Nickels
made it 3-0 seven minutes later
when he started a solo rush
from the right sideline and let
go a shot that somehow manag-
ed to go in between Sears’ leg
and the left post.

UNC came back to score
three goals of its own less than
two minutes after Nickels had
tallied. ;

Mike Burnett created the first
tie of the day at 1:57 when he
brought the ball inbounds from
behind the W&L goal, moved to
Ware Palmer’s left and circled
in mid-air while releasing his
shot into the net.

After John Sancilio and Ward
Steidle »xchanged goals in the
opening minute of the second
quarter, midfielder Jeff Homire
gave Carolina its first lead, 5-4,
when he beat Phil Aiken with a
high 15-yarder. Aiken replaced
Palmer after UNC’s third goal.

The sophomore made 14
saves on 22 shots and was most
impressive near the end of the
first half when he made three
consecutive saves, none of
which was routine. One save
was a deflection and the second
was a leg block on a low
bouncer.

“He (Aiken) had a fine
game,” noted head coach Jack
Emmer,. The coach added that
Aiken would have to work on
‘creating a period of consisten-
2y’’ in the future, however.

Immediately after Homire
made it 5-4, the ‘“‘Armadillo’”’
formation, which the Generals
used several times briefly in the
first quarter, went into full ef-
fect. For a solid nine minutes
(and eight-and-a-half more in
the third quarter), W&L held
the ball by giving it to a mid-
fielder and surrounding him

completely with five team-
mates.

“We don’t regret doing it,’’
said Emmer. ‘‘We had to give
our guys a reason to believe we
could win.”’

And the Generals did almost
pull off the upset. Going into the
fourth quarter behind 7-6, they
rallied to tie the score on a goal
by John Doub at the 14:12 mark.

However, the Tar Heels
scored three straight goals, as
W&L failed to convert on
several man-up situations, to
take a 10-7 lead with just 4:38
left. The teams then traded
goals to make the final margin.

According to the coach., a
discussion among members of
the U.S. Intercollegiate
Lacrosse Association Rules
Committee (of which he is a
member) produced no official
decision either way on whether
a team can hold the ball in the
manner W&L did. So, at this
point, the “Armadillo” might
reappear next season.

The Generals don’t return to
Wilson Field until Spring
Weekend (Saturday, May 8)
against Hofstra University of
Long Island.

This Saturday, W&L will be in
the Carrierdome to take on the
Syracuse Orangemen. In Syra-
cuse, the Generals could be
playing a team that is either
overconfident or reaching its
peak at the end of the season.

“They beat Army (number
two in the polls at the time)
13-11 last week,’’ Emmer
pointed out. “They’re very
talented, but they’ve been in-
consistent this season.’’ A loss
to Division III Cortland State is
an example of Syracuse’s incon-
sistency.

W&L then goes to Salem
Wednesday, May 12, to play
Roanoke College.

“They’re a quick, feisty
team. They had us down 9-2 last
year before we rallied. But their
schedule hasn’t brought out the
best in them,’”’ remarked Em-
mer,

Game time is 3 p.m.

‘Cria’ Headlines For Film Society

by Richard Grefe
and Carren Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society is happy to announce
that Richard Grefe, Reference
and Public Service Librarian at
the University Library, will
succeed Carren Kaston as
Faculty Adviser of the
organization, beginning with
next year’s season. The Film
Society will, in addition, be
strengthened by a generous
grant from the Glasgow Endow-
ment Fund towards next year’s
operating expenses. The pur-
pose of the Fund is ‘‘to promote
the art of expression by pen and
tongue.”’

The next-to-last presentation
in this season’s Film Society
series is the beautiful Spanish
film Cria (Spain, 1977: 115
minutes), written and directed
by Carlos Saura. The film will
be shown in classroom ‘“A”’ of
Lewis Hall at 8 p.m. on Friday,
April 30, and Saturday, May 1,
free of charge.

Cria is a movie from the ‘‘new
Spain,’ Spain since Franco’s
death in 1975. The resulting
greater freedom in the arts is
evident in cinema particularly

in the work of “ose Luis Borau
— Furtivos (Spain, 1975) — and
Saura, who is typically drawn to
the subject matter of childhood.

Cria ‘‘stars’’ Geraldine
Chaplin, but the film is
dominated by the haunting per-
formance of Ana Torrent as
Ana, a 9-year-old girl growing
up in contemporary Madrid. In
her short life, Ana has already
witnessed her mother’s agoniz-
ing death from cancer and her
widowed father’s death in the

‘ embrace of another woman.

Thus orphaned, Ana and her
two young sisters become
charges of a somewhat indif-
ferent aunt and lead lives of fan-
tasy framed by the realities of
their new situation.

This is no Walt Disney child-
hood. Saura has said, “I have
never believed in the child’s
paradise. On the contrary, I
think that childhood is a stage
where nocturnal terror, fear of
the unknown, loneliness are
present with at least the same
intensity as the joy of living and
that curiosity of which
pedagogues talk so much.”’

Despite his concern with the:
darker side of childhood, Saura

does not dwell upon the ‘‘sad”’
— both the: sinister and the
joyful are presented with the
same wide-eyed innocence of
the child. Our own memories re-
mind us that childhood is a
series of overlapping ex-
periences of mystery and
awareness; and Cria excels in
conveying these sensations as
we share with Ana her own
past.

Like most children, Ana sees
and understands — in a murky
way — much more than she is
given credit for. Surely, it is this
adult-insensitivity to children’s
awareness that causes many of
the problems associated with
“raising” children. (The film’s
title comes from the Spanish
proverb ‘‘Cria cuervos y te
sacaran los ojos,’ meaning
“Bring up crows and they will
peck your eyes out.’’) The emo-
tional pain behind Ana’s pacific
exterior is made evident by the
periodic reappearance of her
mother, in whose seemingly
real presence Ana can find com-
fort. Saura’s device of casting

Chuck Norris is starring in his
latest adventure-thriller, Silent
Rage. Silent Rage is not your
average Chuck Norris film.
Director Mike Miller decided to
turn the movie into a pseudo-
psycho horror film. Unfor-
tunately, he did not succeed. ** «

Chuck Norris plays a cop ina
small town. The town is not too
small to have an extensive
laboratory, and certainly not
too small.to have a homicidal
maniac.

Our crazy friend, Ron Silver,
is seen at the beginning of the
movie standing at a phone tell-
ing the doctor, ‘I can’t stand
it,” while children are dancing

about him
Our maniac then calmly

goes outside, gets an ax, and
chops the parents %

The police arrive, in time to
put about forty bullets into our

friend, the killer. The next
scene shows three doctors
hovering around a table
remarking, ‘‘He’s alive.”’ Then,
to add a unique twist to the film,
the doctor injects a ‘“super-
drug”’ into our killer, and he is
now a superhuman mongoloid
who immediately recovers
from any bullet would or stab-
bing.

Finally, Chuck sets out to
“get’”’ our pal, the homicidal
maniac. Naturally, — inters-
persed throughout the film, is
Chuck’s romance with a girl
whose intelligence is only sur-
passed by our friend, the
homicidal maniac. While he
spends his whole time in the
film grunting, she spends hers
squealing and screaming.

Not only is this film not scary,
but Norris does little Kung-Fu,
his tradmark in his earlier
films. He is also supproted by a
uniformly untalented cast.

Hunger Walk BenefitsCROP

by B. Scott Tilley

On Saturday, May 8, men of
the church group of the Lex-
ington Presbyterian Church
along with Washington and Lee
University will sponsor a world
hunger walk to benefit CROP
and the Rockbridge Area Relief
Association (RARA). The walk
will begin at 9 a.m. on the
Chessie Trail between Lex-
ington and Buena Vista.

Participants will solicit
pledges for number of miles
walked, up to 12 miles, with 75
percent of the money raised go-
ing to CROP and the remaining
portion to RARA.

CROP is the name given to
local community efforts to
benefit hunger education and
fundraising for the Church
World Service, which is the
relief development agency of
more than 30 Protestant and Or-
thodox denominations in the
United States.

The organization emphasizes

tries including Costa Rica,
Nepal, Poland, and Afghan-
istan. This is accomplished
through distribution of funds in-
to education, technology, fami-
ly life programs, and
agricultural improvements.

The Rockbridge Area Relief
Association is a _ volunteer
organization which helps _in-
dividuals in the Rockbridge and
Buena Vista areas in emergen-
cy situations such as food,
medicine, and basic living
necessities like doctor bills.

Those interested in helping
the CROP hunger walk, either
by walking or pledging a
walker, can receive more infor-
mation by calling 291-2985 or
463-7870.

In conjunction with the CROP
walk, the Inter-Varsity Chris-
tian Fellowship group will be
designating May 3-7 as World
Hunger Week. Throughout the
week, cans will be provided on
campus and in fraternity

houses. for those who wish to
help eliminate world hunger. .

In addition, Wednesday, May
5, has been designated as World
Hunger Day. Gerry Darrell of
Evans Dining Hall has
volunteered to donate the raw
food cost for everyone who will
give up the evening meal on this
day. Law students and fraterni-
ty houses are also being asked
to participate. Fifty percent of
this money will be donated to a
local organization, the Com-
munity Pantry, and the other
half will go to World Vision In-
ternational.

Frank Williams, who is help-
ing to coordinate the evenis
along with Kelly Moles, Nelson
Ould, and Brook Wright, said,
“We would like to encourage
everyone to participate on
Wednesday and Saturday, but
more even than this, to serious-
ly consider developing a life-
style that confronts rather than
ignores the present world food
crisis.”

Reveals Virginity Lost

The anonymously-admini-
stered poll, indicated that most
of the sexual experiences of
students grew out of love for
their partner.

Eighty-eight percent of those
who had lost their virginity had
done so with their boyfriend,
but 62 percent of those were no
longer dating the same person.
Most of the students have never
had a one-night stand.

The majority of students lost
their virginity between the ages
of 16-19. Forty-three percent of
the non-virgins had sex with on-
ly one partner. 35 percent have
had 2-5 partners, with the re-
maining percentages left for
those with multiple partners.

Of the sexually-active, 75 per-

cent used contraceptives, with
the pill being the most common
type of birth control. Only 10
percent of those who don’t use
contraceptives do so because of
religion, but 4 percent used
withdrawal as a contraceptive.

Eight percent of those
answering the poll considered
themselves lesbians. Of that
group, 6 percent had made love
to another woman and three
percent considered themselves
bisexual.

Please note: this poll was a
random sample of the student
body, taken anonymously.
These figures may be compared
to a similar poll conducted dur-
ing the 1979-1980 year.

Thus far in the search, the
committee has received 186
nominations and applications
for the position. The vacant
position was advertised in the
Chronical of Higher Education
with a deadline of April 15 and
Dean Watt said there had been
only a few late applications. In
addition, 600 schools listed in
the American Association of
Colleges and the American
Association of Universities as
well as all of the schools in the
state of Virginia were notified
of the opening.

Dean Watt stated that ‘‘the
overwhelming majority”’ of the

applicants had formerly held
positions in the academic pro-
fession.

“A strong leader effective in
both academics and capital

fund-raising,” is how Dean Watt,

describes the man for whom
they are looking. Watt also
mentioned that capital building
would not be at the level it had
been at for the last ten years, in
the wake of a successful $67
million dollar fund raising drive
executed by President Huntley.
Watt also noted that the tran-
sition of activity will now move
from the search committee to
the selection committee as the
candidate pool is nearly com-
plete and the tedious task of
qualification remains.

Plimpton’s experience with the

exercise in ‘‘participatory jour-

At various times during his
career, Plimpton has boxed
against light heavyweight
champion Archie Moore, played
tennis against Oswald Jacoby,
pitched against a series of ma-
jor league baseball players,
played goalie for the Boston
Bruins of the National Hockey
League, and toured as an
amateur golfer on the profes-
sional golf tour.

“Out of My League,”’ his 1961
book, describes Plimpton’s
baseball experience while ‘‘The
Bogey Man’’ (1968) chronicles
his exploits on the pro golf tour.

Plimpton, a graduate of Har-
vard University where he ma-
jored in English and was editor
of the Harvard Lampoon, has
not limited himself to sports
endeavors. He signed on as a
percussionist with the New
York Philharmonic in 1968.

basis of a television special en-
titled ‘‘The Secret Musical Life
of George Plimpton.’

a word of explanation should be

First, courses such as Math

by students seeking to fulfill

consequently, may have par-
ticipants with little aptitude for
the subject.

New Rush

(continued from page 2)
enormous weight which a freshman’s decision
often bears. Choosing the proper fraternity will, in
theory, affect his happiness with W&L as a whole
during his four-year stay. Shortening rush would
not give him near-enough adequate time in which
to make this crucial decision.

Yet, argue the Student Affairs Committee and
Inter-fraternity Council, this extensive orientation
period will sufficiently prepare freshmen for their
indoctrination into the helter skelter rush system.
While this so-called orientation period will un-
doubtedly be useful in explaining the basic format
and regulations of rush, it is unable to provide the
kind of ‘“‘feeling”’ freshmen capture when they in-
teract with members of a particular fraternity.
The orientation period is a farce, simply a means
of justifying a shortened rush. Although it will in-
form freshmen candidates of house academic and
intra-mural standings, it cannot give to freshmen
that which is most important in their decision-
making process — namely this genuine gut senti-
ment.

Allowing freshmen to pledge earlier (at the start
of the third week of rush) is yet another danger ex-
istent in the proposed system. Many freshmen will
face no dilemma and will be immediately certain
of the house they wish to join. When the third week
of rush begins, they will be allowed to join the
house they prefer. However, many freshmen will
be unable to decide which house to join. As the
fourth week of rush begins and more freshmen
“tear,” these undecided candidates will feel a
growing pressure to follow suit and resolve the
issue by pledging a fraternity. Often this pressure
reaches unbelievable proportions, and, yet, it is all
the more intensified to the first-year college

newcomer who is still wholly unadapted to his new :

environment. This pressure cannot be exag-

gerated and is often traumatic as evidenced by
those who, realizing their hasty decision, undergo
taken into account little consideration as to the
the agonizing process of depledging a fraternity.
By relocating earlier in the month the date at
which freshmen are permitted to tear, the already
inadequate time they have for making a confident
choice becomes greatly more inadequate.

The lack of a thorough study on behalf of the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee, University Council, and
Inter-fraternity Council in dealing with changes in
the rush system is astonishing. They have acted
with closed minds and have made only feeble at- —
tempts to study the various systems of other col-
leges. Moreover, many of the faculty involved in
the decision-making process are uninformed of
the way in which the system operates and the
rules governing the system (such as the no contact
rule). Consequently, they are not qualified to
make this kind of important decision. Other op-
tions do indeed exist which would reform the
system such that neither the financial burden of
fraternities nor the pressure placed upon
freshmen is increased. The committees engaged
in resolving the rush issue, however, have failed to
probe these options.

If, as proposed, an intensified shortened rush
system, preceded by an extensive orientation
period, is passed, a very grave mistake will have
been committed. With the academic year nearing
an end, the committees involved in finalizing the
proposal are eager to put the issue at rest. The
lack of time with which they have to make a deci-
sion seems likely to determine any resolution a
hasty one. It will not only be a great set-back to the
rush system if the proposal is passed, but also a
tragic shame.

The author, a sophomore, will serve as a member of
next year’s Executive Committee.

Twelve Indicted In Lexing ton Police Theft Ring

by Bill Roberts

Twelve past and present of-
ficers of the Lexington Police
Department were formally ac-
cused Monday by a Rockbrdge
County Circuit Court grand jury
of involvement in various rob-
beries that occured in Lex-
ington during the past ten
years.

The accused include: R.F.

' Wright, J.C. Purvis, J.K. Col-
bert, W.L. Rhodenizer, T.A.
Colbert, D.E. Stubblefield, T.H.
Clark, M.R. Hamilton, D.E.
Moore, J.O. Moore, C.H.
Emore, and W.F. Knick.

The indictments are the
result of a six-week inquiry by
Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C’ ‘‘John” Read, State
Police investigators, Special
Agent Tex Chapmen, and
Special Agent Lewis A. Layne.

Wright’s indictment on
charges of breaking into the

 

Virginia House Restaurant and .

stealing -a ham brings the
number of active Lexington
police officers accused in the
theft ring to five. Colbert, Stub-
blefield, Clark, and Knick, the
other four officers, were
suspended by Chief J.A. Kirby
on Mar. 24.

Kirby is at Quantico this week
taking a course, and Lt. B.M.
Beard said that no action will be
taken to suspend Wright until
Kirby’s return.

Colbert was indicted for petit
larceny. He is charged with
stealing a jeep battery from
Lexington Motor Sales on Dec.
7, 1977.

Stubblefield was also indicted
for petit larceny. He is charged
with stealing two ballpoint pens
from Mays Real Estate in
March, 1979.

Clark was indicted on 11
counts of statuatory burglary,
conspiracy and petit larceny.
He is accused of breaking into

the A&P Store, 1s Dollar,
Spanky’s, and Coiner’s Parts in
conspiracy with Barry Flint.

Flint was suspended from the |

force in Oct., 1981, after his ar-
rest for the theft of $280 from
the Hop-In Store on N. Main St.
in 1977.

Knick was indicted on 14
counts for statutory burglary,
receiving stelen goods, con-
spiracy, grand and petit
larceny. He is charged with
stealing 15 packages of cheese
from Spanky’s. The grand jury
accused him of a series of four
burglaries from Adair-Hutton
occuring between January and
July of 1979. He is charged with
receiving stolen jumper cables,
knowing they had been taken
from Coiner’s Parts by Purvis
and Flint. Knick was also in-
dicted for conspiracy with Flint
to break into Lexington Motor
Sales.

are the “five Star Generals,”
which includes all classes
before 1932.

In terms of music, concerts
will be held Friday night and
Saturday afternoon. Friday’s
concert, which will be held at
Zollman’s Pavillion, features
the Robbin Thompson Band.
The concert will be free and

Following Saturday’s
lacrosse game against Hofstra,
the Producers will play on the .
upper athletic field. This con-

kegs of beer provided by the In-
terfratenrity Council and the
Classes of ’83 and ’85. According
to Martin, the Class of ’83 is
donating $2750, the IFC $2500
and the Class of ’85 $250.

As of this writing the concert
was planned to begin at 5 p.m.

‘ after the law school finishes its

afternoon examinations. The
possibility may arise that the
lacrosse game may be pushed
back to a 3 p.m. start so that
there will be no delay between
the end of the game and the
beginning of the concert.

UC Approves Rush Proposal

by John Cleghorn

In a move that Dean Lewis
John calls “fine tuning,” the
University Council passed a
motion that will move the date
on which a rushee can pledge a
fraternity up one week on the
rush calendar for next fall,
shortening rush four days.

The Inter-fraternity Council
accepted the proposal in its
Tuesday night meeting, making
only small modifications.

Dean John said that the calen-
dar for next year meets what
has actually been taking place
in the last few years, referring
to the date on which rushees
were actually accepting bids.

“By moving the due date for

preference cards up four days,
the decision process will be over
sooner, which appeases some of
the faculty who feel that rush
begins to interfere with classes.
It was this sentiment that open-
ed the question of adapting
rush.

Two additonal changes have
also been made, said Dean
John. A special rush orientation
before contact begins will be
programmed to familiarize
freshmen with fraternities in-
dividually and collectively.

The second change is an ex-
tended open contact period for
the first three days of rush,
designed to let freshmen visit
fraternities before signing ‘up

signing up for open houses
which begin on the Sunday
before classes start.

A second part ot the U.C. mo-
tion stated that the Student Ac-
tivities Committee will study
the rush progrsm in approx-
imately three years for reap-
praisal.

An additional change over
last year’s calendar is the
switch of rush dates to Wednes-
day nights. Rush dates one and
two are on the first Friday after
classes begin, and rush dates
three and four are on the follow-
ing Wednesday. After rush
dates five and six on the next
Friday, the night on which

Plimpton:A Jockular Speech

by Charlie Alcorn

George Plimpton, the
renowned participatory jour-
nalist, charmed a packed house
at Lee Chapel Tuesday night
with some tales of his trade.

With a relaxed hands-in-the-
pockets style, Plimpton shared
the experiences of his certain
Style of journalism which
ranges from playing quarter-
back for the Detroit Lions and
the Baltimore Colts to being a
solo triangle player for Leonard
Bernstein’s New York Philhar-
monic. The oratory was punc-
tuated with his delightful com-
mand of the language and an
almost British-style elegance
that he most likely acquired
from his days in Cambridge as
a scholar.

The body of his speech dealt
with the history of participatory
journalism and how he became
associated with it. As a student
at Harvard, Plimpton yearned
to become a member of the
famous Harvard Lampoon. In
order to join, the editors of the
Lampoon told him that he had
to run the Boston Marathon.
Plimpton was game and he did
it, running the last three blocks
of the race to finish second
behind a possessed Korean who
made a mad sprint to beat him.
Plimpton was soon identified as
an imposter, but this high ex-
perience sparked the interest in
a career destined for glory.

Plimpton spoke of trying to go
beyond the vantage point of the
spectator into the personal

world of athletes — the likes of
which the world had never
heard from before.

He described his forage into
the particular athletic and
aesthetic fraternities as nearly
masochistic because it proved
without a doubt that there is no
room for an amateur in the pro-
fessional realm. He was quick
to add that this was as it should
be because if this were not the
case, the god-like qualities of to-
day’s pro athletes would be lost.

Plimpton saw the athlete’s
world as the stuff of which
daydreams are made, for it is
devoid of most of the problems
of everyday existence. Yet the
other side of the coin revealed a
constant state of pressure to

Archer also reported that

announced that a _ contract
almost identical to that of the

University of Virginia’s has

said that there were ‘‘many
matters that were barred
because of the statute of limita-
tions.”’ said Read, ‘‘We sifted
through and screened a tremen-
dous amount of cases and
brought only a few to the grand
jury.

Read explained that misde-
meanors such as smoking mari-
juana must be _ prosectued
within one year. He did not in-
dicate that smoking marijuana
was part of the allegations
against the police, using it
merely as an explanatory ex-
ample. There is no statute of
limitations for felonies in
Virginia.

May 20 is the arraignment
date for those indicted. They
will be asked to enter a plea of

guilty, no contest, or not guilty.

“T have engaged in a limited
amount of plea bargaining,”
said Read. “I would expect cer-
tain officers to plead guilty as a
result of our investigation.”
Read did not state which of-
ficers to whom he was referr-
ing.

Read did comment that he ex-
pects Wright to be suspended on
Monday. All of those indocted
on Monday have been released
on bond. The Attorney
General’s office in Richmond
had been providing legal
guidance and advice on the in-
vestigation, according to Read.

the investigation.

During the taping, in-

the store manager had told him
that she would tell Chief Kirby
about the theft. He replied that
she had not said she would tell
Kirby, but that she had told
Purvis about it.

There were rumors in Oc-

officers, but without Flint’s
cooperation, an investigation
was dropped.

It began again on Mar. 15
when Flint gave a statemnt to
the State Police immediately
after receiving a three-year
suspended sentence and proba-
tion for the Hop-In theft.

Read promised him immuni-
ty from further prosecution in
exchange for the information.
The terms of his probation were
left indeterminate, ensuring his
collaboration with the in-
vestigators.

Purvis had been questioned
twice by the State Police. He
and four others were indicted on
charges of conspiracy with
Flint. Five were indicted on
charges of conspiracy with Pur-
vis.

‘Entertainment

It wasn’t too long ago that you could safely predict that any band
hailing from Georgia would sport a trio of lead guitarists and a col-
lection of songs devoted to women, whiskey and general hellraisin’.
The Producers may call Atlanta home, but the music on ‘‘The Pro-
ducers,” the quartet’s debut Portrait album, is a striking blend of
pop and rock that’s far removed from standard southern boogie.

“The Atlanta scene is absolutely influenced by modern music,
what has gone on for the last two or three years, and that’s definite-
ly the scene we’re from,”’ says Kyle Henderson. ‘‘Atlanta has pro-
duced at least two major modern bands and that’s proof in itself
that it’s not the southern boogie scent. The B-52s are from Athens
but they played Atlanta constantly and the Brains, who didn’t sell
as well but met with great reviews, are from Atlanta.”’

  
  

The Producers — Van Temple (guitar/vocals), Wayne Famous
(keyboards/vocals), Bryan Holmes (drums/vocals) and Hender-
son (bass/vocals) — learned their instruments in the usual assort-
ment of original and cover bands in and around the Atlanta club cir-
cuit. The band formed when Henderson caught Temple, Famous
and Holmes playing at Uncle Tom’s Tavern in Atlanta on New
Year’s Eve of 1979.

Struck by a personal affinity with their music, Henderson im-
mediately asked them if he could join the band. After an introduc-
tory jam that night proved that the chemistry was there, The Pro-
ducers officially became a band on New Year’s Day, 1980.

They spent the next few months rehearsing and writing new
material before returning to the club circuit, mixing dates featur-
ing their own songs with cover jobs to keep the money flowing. ‘“‘We
played with the Pretenders at the Agora in Atlanta,” Holmes
remembers, ‘‘and the next night we went across the street and
played cover songs at a fraternity party at Georgia Tech.”’

In August, the band’s manager contacted producer Tom Werman

(Cheap Trick, Ted Nugent, Molly Hatchet) about working with the
band. When Werman suggested the band come up to New York to
play for him, The Producers promptly cancelled some Florida club
dates and hopped into a van for the drive north.
_. “We drove 17 hours straight to play one 45 minute set for him at
| SIR in New York,” Henderson recalls. ‘‘We were all hoping he
- would say, ‘Sounds good, let me hear a tape.’ We would have con-
sidered that a positive statement in this day and age.”

Werman’s response was a good deal more enthusiastic than that,
and listening to The Producers will provide more than enough
reasons why. The album reveals a distinctive, impeccable blend of
basic rock drive, pop craftsmanship and memorable melodic hooks
to burn on a collection of a dozen group-penned original songs.

“Usually, one or two people have the original idea, but we’re try-
ing to give the job of arranging a song as much importance as possi-
ble,”’ maintains Henderson. ‘‘How the songs end up sounding is
very dependent upon the input of all four members, everybody is
getting credit “‘

In the tradition of most great rock bands, the Producers have
synthesized their individual influences into an imaginative, ac-
cessible style of their own. Werman’s crisp, crackling production
captures the assured power of the band’s performance on material
| ranging from driving rock (‘‘Sensations,” ‘‘Who Do You Think You
Are’’) To catchy pop (‘‘Boys Say When,” ‘‘What She Does To Me’’).

| The lead vocals, shared by Temple and Henderson, are
augmented by beautifully crafted and executed backing har-
/ monies, The lyrics offer fresh twists and provocative insights into )
| that most universal of themes, moderh romance.

“There’s no sense in writing about something if no one’s going to
understand what you're talking about,’’ Famous contends. ‘“‘We
really take pride in pushing the lyrics out so you can understand
them. There is a meaning in the songs and we don’t want to disguise
."

‘“‘We feel, across the board as a band, that simplicity is a virtue,
not a liability,’’ Henderson sums up. “If there’s a musical idea
that’s great in its simplest form, then keep it that way. To add too
much toa simple, great idea is to take its greatness away.”’

‘Chariots’ Catches On Fire

by Todd Jones

Put simply, Chariots of Fire
is a superb movie.

It is one of those rare in-
stances in film where the movie
comes across as a group pic-
ture, without specific stars,
without especially ‘‘high’’
scenes. The movie is to be taken
as a whole and, when taken as
that whole, is immensely suc-

' cessful.

The story surrounds four run-
ners at the 1924 Olympics in
Paris. It focuses in particular

on two specific runners: one a

Charles Bracelen Flood,
author of the successful new
book, “‘Lee: The Last Years,”
will be in Washington and Lee
University’s Bookstore on Fri-
day (May 7) from 3:30 p.m. to5

p.m.
Flood will autograph copies of
his book, which deals principal-
ly with Lee’s presidency of
Washington College (Wash-
ington and Lee University) and
his role as the prime healer of
the bitterness between North
and South after the Civil War.

Flood’s book, which was
published last fall, has received
glowing reviews. Flood did a
great deal of research for the
book at Washington and Lee,
and many photographs from the
university’s collection appear
in the book.

Flood is a resident of Rich-

nine books, including the best-
selling “‘Love Is a Bridge,”
‘More Lives than One,” a

Jewish student at Cambridge,
the other a minister in Scotland.
It deals with the crises they
each face.

For the first runner, played
by Ben Cross, the crisis is being
Jewish in a part of society
where there are no Jews. It is
fighting with the administration
because he hires a private
coach to improve his running
ability. And it is winning the

, heart of a famous Gilbert and

Sullivan operetta star.

For the other runner, played
by Ian Charleson, the crisis is
deciding whether or not he can
compromise his dedication to
the ministry by spending so
much time running. And an
especially trying crisis is when
he gets to Paris only to learn
that the trials for his event are

Lax Breaks Even In One-Goal Decisions
Roanoke Comeback Thwarted, 11-10

by John Harrison

The Washington and Lee
lacrosse team will be host to
Hofstra University this Satur-
day at 2 p.m. on Wilson Field as
part of Spring and Alumni
weekend festivities.

The Generals will enter the
game with a 6-4 record (not in-
cluding yesterday’s match at
Roanoke College) and a ranking
of 12th in the U.S.I.L.A. poll.
The Flying Dutchmen, led by
seven-year coach Harry Royle,
will bring a 3-8 mark to Lex-
ington. Hofstra was also on the
road yesterday at Rutgers.

The Dutchmen beat W&L in
overtime, 7-6, two years ago to
take a 16-3 lead in the series.

Despite its unimpressive
record, the school from Hemp-
stead, New York, could prove to
be an enigma for the Generals.
“They’re up and down a lot.”’
said W&L Head Coach Jack
Emmer. “‘They lost to (seventh-
ranked) Maryland by one and
beat Towson State 13-8.”’ By
comparison, the Generals need-
ed an overtime period to down
Towson six weeks ago.

Tri-captain Mike Pressler
noted that the team should not
be complacent from overcon-
fidence in preparing for Satur-
day’s match. ‘“‘They’ve had a
tough year but we’re not count-
ing out those guys. They score a
lot and give up a lot,’’ the senior
defenseman said.

The Generals slipped to 12th
in the latest poll and 16 points
behind 1ith-ranked Syracuse
after last Saturday’s 15-14 loss
to the Orangemen in the Car-
rierdome.

W&L held a 14-13 lead when
Dave Dresko scored on Greg
Tarbell’s fifth assist of the day

 

A goal by Mike Schuler and a fine defensive play
by Dave Nickels stopped a Roanoke rally and
helped the Washington and Lee lacrosse team
down the Maroons 11-10 in Roanoke yesterday.

Schuler’s goal came with 6:12 left in the game
after two Roanoke goals within a nine-second span
had cut a three-goal General lead to 10-9.

Roanoke cut the margin back to one with 53
seconds left on a tally by John Remsen, and the
Maroons won the ensuing crucial faceoff. Sean

fired high over the net.

Roanoke retained possession, however, and
Paul Goldsmith went straight for the net.

The score was tied at three after one period of
play, and the Generals took a 5-4 lead into the half.
They then outscored Roanoke 3-1 in the third
quarter and took a 10-7 lead in the fourth on senior
John Sancilio’s third goal of the game.

Goalie Phil Aiken had 14 saves for Washington

The Generals had 53 shots to Roanoke’s 50 and
gained possession of 62 ground balls. The Maroons
came up with 52.

Roanoke, however, won 14 of 25 faceoffs.

“Overall, we had a good ef-
fort. We outplayed them slight-
ly in every category, but we
couldn’t sustain it,’’ Pressler
said. ‘‘We had the extra-man
situation with a minute to go, so
we had our chances.”

Coach Emmer added, “‘It’s a
shame we didn’t win, because
we deserved it after the U.Va
game and the Armadillo
against UNC.”’

The Armadillo stall tactic
was outlawed last week by the

U.S.IL.L.A. Rules Committee.
By a 7-1 vote, the committee ad-
ded a clarification to the rule on
withholding the ball from play.
The addition gives game of-
ficials power to charge a 30-
second technical foul if, in their
opinion, a team is deliberately
withholding the ball, regardless
of where it is on the field.

According to committee
president and U.M.B.C. Head
Coach Richard Watts, ‘“‘Some-
thing had to be done right away.
It could have been a severe pro-
blem the rest of the season and
in the playoffs.’’

Emmer acknowledges that
W&L’s chances of making the
playoffs are slim at this point,
but ‘‘we may slip in there. Right
now, we’re just playing to have
a good year. We’ve been very
competitive except for U.Va.
Our last two games won’t be
easy for us.”

Generals Lose Four, Drop To 8-19

by Andrew P. Hoppes

W&L’s baseball team lost
four games this past week,
finishing their ODAC schedule
with a 5-9 record and standing
at 8-19 overall with two games
remaining.

Last Wednesday against
Longwood, W&L fell behind ear-
ly and never caught up.
Longwood scored four times in
both the sixth and seventh in-
nings to turn a close game intoa
13-2 rout. Dave Randall took the
loss for W&L. :

W&L was limited to five hits.
Senior Thad Ellis pounded two
hits and scored both W&L runs.

In W&L’s last league contest
on Thursday, Lynchburg
defeated the Generals 10-3. The
loss, combined’ with
Bridgewater’s forfeit victory
over Randolph-Macon,
eliminated the Generals from
playoff contention.

W&L got many baserunners |

into scoring position in the
game, but could score too few of
them. Thad Ellis had three hits
and senior Jeff Haggerty and
junior Chris Cavalline had two
apiece.

Freshman Bill White, the only
member of the pitching staff to
return next year, absorbed the
loss. Although hit hard by
powerhouse Lynchburg, Coach
Jim Murdock feels White will be
one of the better pitchers in the
league in a couple of years.

W&L lost Monday afternoon
at V.M.I., 10-6, despite collect-
ing a dozen hits. ‘‘We made
some mental errors on the base
paths to take ourselves out of a
couple innings,” noted Mur-
dock.

W&L fought back from a 5-3
deficit in the game to tie the
score at 5-5. Juniors Jody Har-
ris and Chris Cavalline keyed
the rally with two hits and
sophomore Mike Walsh ripped
three hits and drove in four runs
for the Generals.

The Keydets ended any hopes
W&L had of beating them twice
in the same season by scoring
five late runs. V.M.I. scored
three times in the seventh and

twice in the eighth to seal the

win.
Tuesday the Generals lost a
12-10 slugfest to Newport News

Apprentice in the season’s
home finale.

With Newport News in front
4-0, W&L scored three times in
the third. Mike Walsh had a
two-RBI single and Chris
Cavalline accounted for the
other run with a single.

The Generals still trailed 5-4
going into the bottom of the
sixth, when they used some
heads-up baseball to the score.
Senior Tripp Brown dropped a
successful suicide squeeze bunt
to score senior Mark
McLaughlin.

In the seventh, W&L scored
four more times to assume a
commanding 9-5 lead. Two runs
scored when sophomore Dave
Warrenfeltz executed another
suicide squeeze and Newport
News erred on the play.
Sophomore Kevin Lolden plated
the other two runs with a sharp
single up the middle.

Newport News refused to
quit, though, and scored three
times in the eighth and four
times in the ninth to earn a 12-10
decision. Losing pitcher Jim

The ‘Armadillo,’ Cont.

Reprinted with permission from the May I, 1982 edition of the Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch.

An NCAA rules committee deserves a cheer for swiftly barring
any repetition of the Armadillo that Washington and Lee’s lacrosse
coach sprang on the unsuspecting No. 1-ranked North Carolina Tar
Heels when they visited Lexington last weekend.

The Armadillo, as invented by Coach Jack Emmer and entertain-
ingly described Thursday by T-D sports writer Jerry Lindquist, en-
tailed five W&L players locking arms and forming an impenetrable
shell, as an armadillo, around a teammate who has the ball. Ob-
ject: stall, delay, kill the clock, sit on the ball, give your team a
chance to upset a clearly superior team.

The “highly partisan” W&L crowd loved the Armadillo as it very
nearly enabled the Generals to snap mighty UNC’s 19-game winn-
ing streak. But while we are biased, too, when it comes to choosing
sides between Gen. Lee’s College and the University of Tarheelia,
we are not fond of action-killing strategy in any sport designed for
movement. (Maybe chess is an exception.) Even if the underdog,
or in this case armadillo, is burying the ball mainly to keep from
being annihilated, we’d rather see the fellows go down fighting in-
stead of just going down.

Still, we must confess to finding poetic justice in the W&L coach’s
selection of a foe on which to sic the Armadillo. And we are amused
by the surly reaction from the Tar Heels, with their goalie calling
the W&L delaying tactic garbage and their coach hurrying to drop
W&L from UNC’s schedule. Are memories so short? Only last
month another No. 1-ranked UNC team, coached by the sainted
Dean Smith, took the air out of a basketball for the final 13 minutes
of the Atlantic €oast Conference tournament championship in
order to defeat the University of Virginia. And the Tar Heels had no
excuse of being a definite underdog in that contest, though their
coach acted as though they were one.

Is the Armadillo, now blessedly extinct, really so different in
principle from the Polar Bear that some basketball teams use to
chill an opponent (and fan interest) when they can do so within the
rules?

Netters Finish Third;

by David Stuart
The Washington and Lee ten-
nis team came in third place,
but two freshmen, Andy Haring
and Stephen Bendheim, and the
number two doubles pair of Wes
Yonge and Jim Irwin captured
second places in their flights in
last weekend’s Old Dominion
Athletic Conference tennis tour-
nament at W&L.
Hampden-Sydney won four of
six singles titles to place first in
the event, and Lynchburg swept
the other two singles champion-
ships to come in second.

Haring Drops Thriller

Haring, known for his thrill-
ing tie-breaker victories and
steady strokes, held out for
three hours before losing, after
a three-minute match point, 6-7,
6-4, 7-5. In the first set, he came
back from a 5-3 deficit to win
the tiebreaker seven points to
five.

Bendheim made a_ great
comeback in the second set of
his singles final, but was stop-
ped 6-1, 6-4, by Kevin Farina of
Hampden-Sydney.

In other matches, Yonge and
Irwin dropped their doubles
final. Craig Cannon and Charlie
Kalocsay each won consolation
finals in singles to take third
place. The scores were 6-3, 6-2,

Hampden-Sydney may have
won the ODAC title, but Lynch-
burg laid claim to the number
one singles champion. Buzz
Frey, seeded second in the tour-
nament, was shaken by the
Tigers David Fredway in the
first set, but recovered to win
24, 61, 6-1. Fredway had
beaten Frey handily 6-3, 6-0, a
week earlier.

Patience Pays

A Lynchburg senior, Frey pa-
tiently waited his chance and
took advantage of Fredway’s
unforced errors. H-SC tennis
coach Bobby Saylor said to his
players before the matches
that, ‘‘This game is played with
your hands and your feet.”’

Fredway was reported to
have said, “You're right,
coach,” after his loss in the
singles final.

Two Freshmen Second

The W&L squad ended the
season on the road Tuesday at
Radford University. Craig Can-
non finished the season on a
high note by winning his
number one singles match, 1-6,
6-2, 6-2. The team, however,
posted an 8-1 loss, making the
final season record 6-17.

Yonge Closes Career

Tennis coach Gary Franke
will lose veteran, number two
player Wes Yonge to graduation
this year but can also look for-
ward to Steve Denny returning
after a year abroad. Franke
said, ““Yonge has been a consis-
tent performer for four years”
and has played “better tennis
this year than he ever has
before.’’

McKee, McBryde Lead W&L

Senior John McKee and
sophomore Angus McBryde
claimed titles this past Satur-
day, May 1 to lead Washington
& Lee to third place in the sixth
annual Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Track and Field
Championships held at W&L’s
Wilson Field.

McKee, from Clarksdale,
Miss. won the shot put competi-
tion with a toss of 45 feet, 11 and
one-half inches to outdistance
his nearest competitor by more
than two feet. McBryde, from
Charlotte, N.C. earned first
place in the 1500-meter run in
the closest event of the day. His
time of 4:02.48 edged the
runner-up’s mark of 4:02.50.

W&L finished with 50 team
points to place behind Lynch-

burg College’s ‘74 and
Bridgewater College’s 51.
Eastern Mennonite (41),

Roanoke (23), Emory & Henry
(22), and Maryville (11) com-
pleted the scoring. Over 130
athletes participated in the
meet.

Baseball—

Stanley was plagued by bad
hops, some errors, and a few
walks in the two innings he
worked.

The loss could not totally
obscure two fine defensive
plays turned in by W&L’s senior
co-captains in their last home
game. Centerfielder Thad Ellis
made a superb diving catch of a
line drive in the fourth, and first
baseman Jeff Haggerty made a
leaping grab on a viciously hit
liner in the fifth.

W&L concludes its season on
Saturday with a doubleheader
at Christopher Newport.

“To place third with a
relatively young team is
respectable,”’ offers 12th-year
head coach Norris Aldridge, ex-
plaining that ten of W&L’s 12
place-winners were freshmen,
sophomores, or juniors. ‘‘Our
men had personal-best perfor-
mances in nearly every event
and helped us to our best show-
ing in the ODAC meet since 1977
(when the team also placed
third).”’

Junior Eric Nelson
(Charleston, W.Va.), classmate
Sparky Anderson (Pulaski,
Va.) and sophomore Charlie
Alcorn (Victoria, Tex.) earned
high finishes for W&L in the
field events. Nelson placed
fourth in both the discus and
javelin competitions, Anderson
second in the javelin, and
Alcorn third in the discus and
shot put events.

In the races junior Alan Ar-
mitage (Port Elizabeth, Maine)
placed third in the 1l0-meter
high hurdles, freshman Scott

Henderson (Maryville, Ohio)
third in the 400-meter hurdles,
senior Russ Rector (Kansas Ci-
ty, Mo.) fourth in the 400-meter
hurdles, classmate Frank Pitt-
man (Atlanta, Ga.) fifth in the
1500-meters, and sophomore
Kevin Kadesky (Dallas, Tex.)
fifth in the 200-meters.

W&L’s 400-meter relay team
of Kadesky and freshmen Der-
rick Freeman (Birmingham,
Ala.), Chris Ives (New Orleans,
La.) and Chris Busbee (Dallas,
Tex.) placed second and set a
new school record of 44.02
seconds. The Generals’ mile-
relay team of Busbee,
sophomore Paul Chapman
(Shorts Hills, N.J.), freshman
Martin Pruitt (Covington, Va.)
and classmate Mark Pembroke
(Shorewood, Wis.) finished in
fourth place.

W&L concluded its season by
competing on Tuesday, May 4in
a dual meet at Bridgewater.
The Generals took a 5-1 record
into that event.

An Evening In Durham With Some Grateful Deadheads

by John Wells

RICHMOND—With no T.V.
here and a little free time I
realize the weeks melt away
this spring and with them, my
final opportunities to write
about anything on my mind — a
unique privilege I’m sure I shall
miss. And there are a few things
I want to write about, that I’ve
been considering for more than
a while. The first is the
phenomenon of the Grateful
Dead.

Surely it is an ongoing
phenomenon, as the myth
perpetuates itself among
younger and younger Dead-
heads. And while they are un-
doubtedly a small segment of
our population, they are
definitely there. Go to a Dead
concert.

I did, last month, at Duke
University, the first show of the
group’s current tour. I had seen
them before, in 1978, and had
long planned to spend this par-
ticular weekend in nearby
Chapel Hill, N.C., where a
friend of long-standing hap-
pened to procure us tickets to
the concert.

A W&L friend expressed sur-
prise at my going; ‘I didn’t
know you were into the Dead,”’
said he. I replied that, despite
my staid demeanor, I, too, have
an appreciation for the par-
ticular talents of the Grateful
Dead. I did not say I was a
Deadhead, although I was
tempted, because something in-
side would not allow me to

Broadcast Facilities To Be Dedicated

The broadcast facilities of
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s department of journalism
and communications will be
dedicated as the O.W. Riegel
Telecommunications Labor-
atories during a_ special
ceremony on Friday, May 7, at
2p.m. in Reid Hall at W&L.

Located on the third floor of
Reid Hall, the facilities consist
of fully equipped studios for
WLUR-FM, the 175-watt cam-
pus radio station, and Cable
Nine, the university television
station that cablecasts over the
Lexington Cable System.

O.W. Riegel, for whom the
facilities will be named, served
for 34 years as head of the
department of journalism and
communications at Washington
and Lee. He is generally
credited with developing the
university’s journalism _ pro-
gram from a modest infancy in-
to an important center for the
education of young journalists.

A graduate of the University
of Wisconsin with a master’s
degree from Columbia Univer-
sity, Riegel was a member of
the Washington and Lee faculty
from 1930 until his retirement in
1973.

Prior to coming to
Washington and Lee, he had
worked on newspapers Ddeth in
the United States and abroad.

make such an admission, and I
would later find out why.

Despite the fact that ‘‘Work-:

ingman’s Dead’’ is one of my
favorite albums.

There used to be a lot of show
biz one-liners centering around
the old cliche of ‘‘where
Vaudeville went to die.’’ No one
seems to talk about where the
Flower Children have gone to
die, but if they should ever
bother to ask, they need to look
no further than the nearest
Grateful Dead concert.

Driving into the outer reaches
of the Duke campus, small
clusters of Deadheads, clad in
denim and tie-dye, passed
smoking objects and beckoned
passers-by for tickets. My first
thought was, “‘Christ, I didn’t
bring my bandana. How
boorish, how unchic. Will the
faux pas go undetected?’’ For-
tunately it did, even though
headbands were definitely the
order of the day.

The crowd waiting in the
vicinity of the gym was both
rowdy and mellow. About a hun-
dred who couldn’t get tickets
sat on a nearby hill to listen.
Ticket holders jammed in the
doors and ran immediately for
the best general admission
seats.

I purchased a Dead T-shirt.
Then we sat and waited for the
proceedings to commence.

The Dead sauntered out at
about quarter after nine to an
uproarious audience response.
For the next hour and a half,

He is internationally known as
an authority on propaganda.
His classic work, ‘Mobilizing
for Chaos: The Story of the New
Propaganda,” was originally
published in 1934 but was

_ brought back into print almost

40 years later by the book-
publishing division of the New
York Times.

Riegel emphasized practical
experience as an integral ele-
ment in the university’s jour-
nalisfh curriculum, Broadcast
journalists were given exten-

they did their thing to. the
general approval of all. How
can they go wrong? They have a
built-in audience of adoring

followers wherever they want to’

play, and they tour almost an-
nually to sell-out crowds. Their
endurance is remarkable when
one considers they’ve never had
a true Top 40 hit, and that fact,
in my opinion, entitles them to
an overwhelming amount of
esteem. -

 

At least as entertaining as the
actual performance is the off-
stage spectacle provided by the
hardcore Deadhead contingent.
Those who thought rhythmic
contortionists were relegated
no the ranks of twisting shakers
of Soul Train are wrong. All
around, bodies sway gently and
violently, long hair flying, hips
gyrating. Four years ago, I
recalled, it was the first five

words and music and whatever
was in their systems.

performed dutifully. They know
what the crowd pleasers are,
and during ‘‘Truckin’” got a
predictably shrill response to
the refrain ‘‘What a _ long,
strange trip it’s been.”’

There were three extended
jams, a trademark of Dead
shows, and periods enjoyed
lustily by the hardest-core
Deadheads. I had remembered
the 1978 jams as having been
more spirited. Garcia, at one
point, had grabbed a folding
chair and used it as percussion
instrument. I became more
detached during these jams,
though, and realized why I had
not been able in good cons-
cience to identify myself as a
Deadhead. This is what they’re
all about, and I simply didn’t

get off. It was a good show, un-
doubtedly, but while it was the
stuff that spins legends in the
minds of many, it was not so
with me, although the Dead are
as close to being legendary as
any other group still playing. I
consider them to be an all time
great, even if I can’t totally
agree (but thoroughly under-
stand) my friend who says for
his money the Dead puts on a
better show than the Stones.

Although the Dead following
swells year by year, the majori-
ty of the faithful are definitely

should be. Most of those who

Broadway and 50th St. in New
York City for a Dead show at
Radio City in 1980 were older
still. And the snide appellation
of Granola Groupies does not
hold when one looks at the
unhealthy pallor and rather
fried-looking eyes of these folks.

You have to have a built-in
appreciation. Jane Fonda took.
her kids to see the Dead in L.A.
a couple of years ago, and ex-
plained to them that the group
“is really quite good.” The
adolescents squirmed unap-
preciatively.

Well, at least she exposed
them to the Grateful Dead, and
more people should give them a
closer examination. Beyond the
realm of popular music as con-
fined to the O’Jays and Janice,
such exposure would seem to be
‘desirable.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The Indictments

We can only speculate on the reaction that the front
page story on the indictment of 12 Lexington police of-
ficers will receive from our readers. The initial reac-
tion will, of course, be one of ‘‘I told you so.”’ That
reaction will likely be followed by a few chuckles.
“Stole a ham, that’s funny.”’ “‘Stole a few pens, that’s
funny.”

 

 

 

Perhaps we should stop and think about this for a
* few minutes. Too often, stories and editorials reflect
nothing more than venom. This was the case last
March when we ran an ediotrial on the L.P.D. In that
example, we chastised the entire L.P.D. for being a
bunch of no-goodniks. We do not mean to go the op-
posite direction now — we are not defending the men
who stand accused. We only want to go on record as
saying that before berating the L.P.D. during these
times, perhaps we should remeber that 12 people, not
just 12 objects, are on trial.

To read a story about a man stealing a ham should
not induce laughter. If anything, this should make the
reader feel fortunate that he or she has never done
such a thing. Granted, one must always be alarmed:
when stories of fraud, theft, and corruption arise. But
we believe that reactions to these stories are not real-
ly those of alarm, but those of smugness. One should
be alarmed that members of the L.P.D. are accused
of theft, but they should not be overly smug or sar-

‘ eastic because of the misfortunes of someone else.

We often accuse the local police for a callousness
toward the student body. When we laugh at the
downfall of local policemen, are we not also guilty of
this same callousness?

Tsuji To Lecture On Buddha

Kenryu Takashi _ Tsuji,
minister of Ekoji Buddhist
Temple in Springfield, Va., will
lecture on ‘‘Buddha-Dharma:
The Way of Enlightenment” on
Monday, May 10, at 8 p.m. in du-
Pont Auditorium on the Wash-
ington and Lee University cam-

us

The lecture is sponsored joint-

ly by the East Asian Studies
program and the department of
religion at W&L. The public is
invited.

From 1968 through 1981,
Bishop Tsuji was presiding of-
ficer of the Buddhist Churches
of America (Shin Buddhist
denomination) with its national
headquarters in San Francisco.
During the same period, he was
president of the Institute of
Buddhist Studies at Berkeley,

Dear Sir:

I am writing in regard to the.

discussion of fraternity rush in
last week’s Ring-tum Phi
(‘‘New Rush; Same Problems”
and “A New Rush?” April 29
issue, p. 2).

I regret that the numerous
factual errors of those articles
may detract from an
understanding of both the cur-
rent and the new rush pro-
cedures. To point out a few of
the more obvious and glaring
inaccuracies:

(1.) ‘This resolution...in-
volves shortening rush from six
to four weeks.’’ Wrong. The pro-
posal adopted by the University
Council on April 29 permits
pledging after the beginning of

- the second weekend (rather

than the third, as stated in the
previous policy) following the
start of classes during the fall
term. Rush may theoretically
be shortened by one week,
although the proposal presented
by the Student Affairs Commit-
tee to the University Council on
April 29 would actually shorten
rush by only four days.

(2.) “By relocating earlier in
the month the date at which
freshmen are permitted to

tear...’’ Wrong again..

Freshmen this year were al-
lowed to accept bids after the
fourth rush date on September
25, 1982. Under the Student Af-
fairs Committee proposal for
next fall, freshmen will be
allowed to accept bids after the
sixth rush date, on September

24, which allowed to accept bids .

after the sixth rush date, on
September 24, which is the
same relative time (the second
Friday following the start of
classes).

(3.) “(fraternity) members
exceed 80 percent of the student
body...’’ At the end of the fall
and winter terms this year, the
actual figures were 63.1 percent
and 62.5 percent respectively.

Campus debate on important
issues is healthy and to be en-

Cal. He is the author of many
publications in the field of Bud-
dhist studies.

In 1981, Bishop Tsuji
established the first Shin Bud-
dhist congregation in the
“Washington, D.C., area with the
dedication of Ekoji (The
Gift of Light Temple) in Oc-
tober.

Bishop Tsuji’s denomination
traces its lineage to Shinran'
(1173-1262), a Japanese Bud-
dhist who founded the Pure
Land Shin sect in medieval
Japan (during the lifetime of
Francis of Assisi and Thomas
Aquinas). The Pure Land scrip-
tures, which originated in India,
were translated. into
Chinese and subsequently in-
troduced into Japan.

While Zen Buddhist may be

 

couraged. Opinions can and will
differ on subjects such as the
importance and value of frater-
nities, the thoroughness of the
studies conducted this year on
fraternity rush, and certainly

better known in the West, Shin
Buddhism is the largest and
most significant religious
movement in Japanese history;
in part because it provides a
path for lay Buddhists. The first
missionaries arrived in the
‘United States in 1898. In the
United States mainland and
Hawaii, there are 150 temples
and branches served by 130
ministers. Membership is
estimated at 100,000.

Shin Buddhist thought has at-
tracted the attention of western
scholars for the apparent
similiarity with Christian doc-
trine. The key to salvation is
faith alone rather than anything
human beings can achieve
through their own efforts such
as ritual practices, meditation,
or good works.

Phi Rush Errors Corrected

the ‘desirability of delayed or
deferred rush. I hope in the
future, however, that Ring-tum
Phi reporters will do the
necessary research to write
stories that are factually cor-
rect. In this way, the Phi will be
better able to carry out its
legitimate roles of promoting
greater understanding of cam-
pus issues and of stimulating
University-wide discussion and
debate.
Sincerely,
Lewis G. John
Dean of Students

New Rush Outlined

‘Dear Sir:
' In response to last week’s ar-
ticle ‘‘New Rush, Same Prob-
lems”’ I would first like to point
out that the University Council
meeting, where the ‘‘disastrous
decision” was made, was an
open meeting and anyone who
felt strongly about the issue was
-more than welcome to come to
the meeting and express his opi-
nion. Not only would the UC
benefit from any input but I also
feel strongly that the Phi would
also have benefited by coming
to the meeting and getting its
facts straight concerning the
past system and concerning the
proposal that was being made.

1. First of all, the 16 W&L
fraternities only ‘‘boast” ap-
proximately 60 percent of the
»W&L student body (Not the 80
percent figure that was
reported).

2. Second, the new proposal
would reduce the length of of-
ficial rush by four days, from
four and one-half weeks to four
weeks as opposed to the six to
four week change that was
reported.

3. The new proposal would not
alter in any way the date that
freshman are allowed to
“tear.” It would, however, give

the fraternities and _ the
freshmen more opportunities
for contact, including six in-
stead of four rush dates, within
this time period.

4. The new proposal also pro-
vides for an open weekend of
rush before open house
registration which should allow
the freshmen to make educated
decisions when deciding which
houses to go to for open houses.

5. The article also accuses the
SAC, the UC, and the IFC of an
“astonishing’’ lack of study. In
light of the fact, is it not the
Ring-tum Phi’s lack of study
that can be termed ‘aston-
ishing?”

Sincerely,
Mason Ellerbe
President-IFC

by Scott Mason
An incident involving

members of the Sigma Phi Ep-
silon and Phi Gamma Delta
fraternities early Saturday
evening escalated into damages
estimated at several hundred
dollars, criminal charges and
warrants for arrest.

Russell Rosler of Sigma Phi
Epsilon and Drew Clark of
neighboring Phi Gamma Delta
engaged in a hostile dispute
after Clark apparently
threatened to drive his 1970
LTD automobile onto the SPE
front yard.

At approximately 7:45 p.m.
Saturday night, following the
Producer’s concert on the upper
athletic field, Rosler said he
saw Clark moving his car from
the FIJI lawn. Clark said he had
parked the car there temporari-
ly and was on his way to move
the vehicle into the FIJI park-
ing lot.

At this time, an unidentified
FIJI member shouted to Clark
to drive the LTD through the
SPE yard. The two houses are
separated by an oak tree and
several bushes which serve as a
border between the two houses.

Upon hearing this and seeing
Clark maneuver his car
threateningly close to the SPE
yard, Rosler grabbed a Sprite
bottle, stood in front of Clark’s
automobile, raised his weapon
and warned him not to proceed
further.

Clark said he was merely tur-
ning the car around and had no
intention of driving onto the
SPE yard. Rosler said,
however, that Clark rolled
about two feet onto SPE proper-
ty and seemed to be threatening
to proceed further. Clark, on the
other hand, said he did not drive

 

Letter To Chi Psi Fraternity:

 

 

Police Apologize For Stopping Band

by John Cleghorn

What seemed to be a simple
noise warning incident at the
Chi Psi fraternity turned into an
embarassment for the Lex-
ington police force and a letter
of apology from police Chief
James Kirby.

On Sat., April 24, a band party
at Chi Psi was shut down by two
inexperienced Lexington of-
ficers who claimed that a com-
plaint had been filed against the
fraternity for loud noise
emanating from the band, The
Toys. Last week, Chi Psi presi-
dent Danny Einstein received a
letter from chief Kirby explain-

ing the error and offering an

‘ apology but offering no compen-
sation for the expense of closing
the band down early.

Officers Knick and
Thomasson, both temporary
replacements for the sus-
pended Lexington officers,
gave Einstein a warning at ap-
proximately 11:20 p.m. claim-
ing that if a complaint was
received, the party would be
immediately stopped.

Approximately one hour
later, after the officers had

, Observed the party from the

street for a short period of time,
Knick and Thomasson personal-

ly stopped the band.

“I knew something was rotten
from the start,’’ said Einstein,
who had taken special care to
keep the front door closed and
contain the noise within the
house. ‘“‘There’s just nobody
that we can bother around
here,’ commented the house
President.

After the band had been stop-
ped, Einstein specifically asked
the officers if there had been a
complaint filed. Upon their
acknowledgement, Einstein in-
quired the identity of the com-
plaining party which the squad

onto the SPE property and that
he believed it may have been
impossible to maneuver the
vehicle between the tree and
bushes.

With Rosler’s arm waving in

came down, smashing the bottle

Editorial Opiric> of The Ring-tum Phi
Drop/Add

A letter on this page introduces a subject that has
not been discussed much on campus this year —
drop/add. The main controversy surrounding the
drop-add rule has been whether a student can make a
sound decision after only one week of the course. The
letter below claims that one week is not a suitable
period for making such a choice.

If one looks at the situation, a week is probably
enough time to make the drop-add decision. For one,
a student in theory has the wisdom of a faculty ad-
visor to fall back on. More likely, an industrious stu-
dent can confer with other people who have taken the
course — and then decide the course’s worth. On a
campus this size, plenty of input can be achieved
within the span of a week.

There is a problem with drop-add, however. Some
professors are very lax in their courses during the
first week of a term — the spring term being the most
noticeable one. Professors sometimes miss the first
week of classes — or hold only one or two sessions. In
‘this case, the student is at a disadvantage. Sometimes
the professor is not even physically available for con-
sultation. This too works against the student’s favor.

All things considered, however, the drop-add rule
seems sensible enough. The system does place
pressure on the student to make a sound decision by
the end of one week — but making responsible deci-
sions is part of the college experience. Philosophers
suggest that Rome was built in a day and the world
was created in six days. There is no reason, therefore,
that a student cannot drop-add within a week.

NBC News correspondent
Lloyd Dobyns told a
Washington and Lee University
audience Thursday night (May
6) that ‘the problems of
establishing a working educa-
tional system that meets to-

day’s and tomorrow’s needs .

are...horrendous.”’

A 1957 graduate of
Washington and Lee, Dobyns
was the keynote speaker for the
annual Alumni Reunion week-
end at the university. He was
participating in the 25th reunion
of his Washington and Lee
class.

Dobyns has won_ several

awards in recent years for his.

writing and reporting on
several NBC documentaries
dealing with economic issues.
In July he will become co-
anchor of a new NBC newscast

‘that will begin at 1:30 a.m. and

last one hour.

Citing the explosion that has
occurred in communications
and technology over the past 46
years, Dobyns suggested that 25
years from now there will be
“technological changes that no
one here this evening can im-
agine. If you can accept that,
then you must accept this: In
those 26 or fewer years, the
pressures on educational | in-
stitutions will become almost
unbearable.

“The need for trained man-
power will become the most im-
portant economic concern we
have. The need for continuing
education on several levels will
be compelling.”

Dobyns said that the changes
necessary for education to keep
pace will be made ‘only by
those who have been taught how

to learn, people who have been
educated well enough to know
that as things change, they are
no longer well educated.”

Dobyns rejected the argu-
ment made by some that educa-
tion should ‘‘become a junior
partner of industry” in the
future.

“To train someone only to
work does not train him to
learn,” said Dobyns. ‘‘And if he

cannot learn, how will he keep
up as demand changes?”

Dobyns said that. even a
perfect educational system
would not cause the economic
problems the country now faces
to goaway.

But he added that “if educa-
tion does not improve, then
nothing else we do will solve the
problem. Education is not the
solution, but there is no solution
without education.”

C-School Initiates"

Washington and Lee
University’s chapters of Beta
Gamma Sigma, the national
honor fraternity in business ad-
ministration, and Omicron
Delta Epsilon, the national
honor society in economics,
held their initiation ceremonies
on the campus Thursday (May

6). in

The Beta of Virginia Chapter
of Beta Gamma Sigma initiated
six undergraduates and one
faculty member while also
making an alumnus, Robert G.
Brown of Dallas, Texas, an
honorary initiate.

Brown, a 1949 graduate of
Washington and Lee, is chair-
man of the board and chief ex-
ecutive officer of University
Resources Corporation of
Dallas.

In 1979, Brown and his wife,
Judy Brown, established an en-
dowed professorship in the
School of Commerce,
Economics, and Politics at
W&L. He was the first W&L
alumnus to create an endowed
professorship by an outright

gift during his lifetime. The pro-
fessorship honors the 40-year
teaching career of Lewis K.
Johnson, professor emeritus of
administration at W&L.

Dr. Carl P. Kaiser, assistant
professor of economics, was the
faculty initiate of Beta Gamma
Sigma while the student in-

‘ itiates were seniors Graham T.

Burnette of Lexington, Andrew
F. Gottschalk of Lake Forest,
Ill., John E. Monroe of New
Orleans and juniors Timothy J.
Elfering of Lake Forest, IIl.;
Vincent J. Fechtel of Leesburg,
Fla., and F. William Gue of
Alexandria.

Omicron Delta Epsilon in-
itiated Dr. Bruce H. Herrick,
professor of economics, along
with seniors David R. Cordell of
Oklahoma City, Robert L.
Dalman of Greenwich, Conn.,
Clifford T. Gordon of St. Louis,
Md., Titus H. Harris of Houston,
David A. Nickels of Huntington,
N.Y., Daniel L. Weiss of Chevy
Chase, Md., and junior John C.

Student Irked At Faculty EC

Dear Sir: .

I am writing in regard to an
incident that I had with the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the facul-
ty. I feel that I have been
treated unjustly and would like
the student body to be aware of
it.

Monday (May 3), one day
after the drop/add period had
ended, I was denied the right to
drop a sociology course. After
having gone to classes for a
week, I made this decision
which would leave me with an
economics course. Yet, because
I was only one day late, I had to
go through the process of peti-
tioning the E.C. Two days later
I received a letter in the mail
from the Dean of the College de-
nying me the right to drop the
course on the grounds that my
reasons were not valid.

This left me with the alter-
native of continuing to take it
this spring or flunking it this
spring and taking it in the fall. I
chose the latter.

The E.C.’s basic reason for
not letting me drop this course
is that it cannot make an excep-
tion to a rule. This rule was
made because the E.C. feels

that one week is a sufficient
amount of time to drop or add a
course. If a person is thinking of
dropping a course he will
evidently not work as hard dur-
ing the drop/add period. In the
case that he decides to take the
course, that one week of not
working up to 100 percent of his
capacity could slightly hurt him

 

in the long run. This is true, but
it has no relevance to my situa-
tion. This also leads one to
believe that there is a major
flaw in the decisions of the Ex-
ecutive Committee. Having this
“F”’ on my report card will (1)
psychologically damage my
academic performance, (2)
hurt the fraternity house’s
grade point average and” (3)

destroy my own grade point
average. This is all because of
the inadequate ruling of the Ex-
ecutive Committee.

How can one flunk a course
without having taken it? It is
these reasons that leads me to
believe that the faculty Ex-
ecutive Committee has not ade-
quately reviewed my situation
and is generally afraid to make
an exception to a ludicrous rule
in such extreme circumstances.

My proposal is to do some
justice for the students at W&L
and petition the executive com-
mittee to make an amendment
to this rule. I propose that if a
student is definitely going to
drop a course but must resolve
to flunk it because the drop/add
period has ended, then the
grade and the course be om-
mitted from the report card.
This is not a very demanding
proposal considering that tak-
ing an “‘F’”’ in this situation is a
senseless reduction of a stu-
dent’s morale because of an un-
fair decision made by the facul-
ty Executive Committee.

Sincerely,
Rusty Hartley

‘8-1/2’ To Go At Lyric

by Carren O. Kaston

The Lyric Theatre in
downtown Lexington will show
Federico Fellini’s 8% (Italy,
1963: 135 minutes) in conjunc-
tion with Professor Carren
Kaston’s spring film course,
English 234. The special screen-
ing, which is made possible
through the generosity of the
theatre’s manager, Mr. Dale
Tomlin, will take place at the
Lyric on Tuesday, May 18, at 2
p.m. for a charge of $2 per per-
son. The public is cordially in-
vited to attend.

One of the masters of the
modern cinema, Fellini entered
filmmaking with a background
in both journalism and the
theatre, a double heritage of
which he was to make use in his
progression from Neorealism to
Surrealism. Fellini first worked
with the Neorealist director
Roberto Rossellini on Rome,
Open City (Italy, 1945) and
Paisa (Italy, 1946). Neorealism
was founded on a belief in the
documentary power of the
everyday surfaces of life to
reveal what was meaningful
and “real” about experience.
Fellini ultimately questioned
whether this =~. sense of

reality was adequate, whether
reality resided purely in sur-
faces and external appear-
ances, in the look of things. His
questions led him to emphasize
fantasy and dream: the reality
beneath the surfaces — Sur-
realism.

Aside from 814, which is con-
sidered his transitional film,
Fellini is perhaps best known
for La Strada (1954), La Dolce
Vita (1950), Juliet of the Spirits
(1965), Stayricon (1969), Roma
(1972), and Amarcord (1974). In
his work, the circus appears
Over and over again as an
emblem of magic and fantasy,
although it is also, for Fellini,
an element of fact since, at the
age of 10, he ran away from
home and joined the circus.

8% makes the New Wave
tenet that the director is the
“star of a film literally true on
two levels. First, Fellini picked
to represent him, the director,
one of the stars of the Italian
cinema, Marcello Mastroianni.
Second, the movie self-
consciously takes as its hero a
movie director. Guido, a direc-
tor who is suffering from

Saturday afternoon the
students who journeyed up to

well worth their effort. The

The Producers have been

their hard work. It is well pro-

pop and rock that emphasizes
simplicity and word execution
much like the Police. It is also

pop bands’ short songs with cat-
chy melodic hooks (‘‘Nobody
knows what she does to me, Too
bad that she does the same to
you.’’) The band is a combined
singing and songwriting effort
of Van Temple (vocals/guitar),
Kyle Henderson(vocals/bass),
Wayne Famous (keyboards/
vocals) and Bryan Holmes
(vocals/drums).

The tirst album edged its way
into the top 100 and the songs
“What She Does to Me” and
“What’s He Got’ received
airplay in the south. These two
songs also highlighted the first
set Saturday afternoon.

After the rain had cleared,
the lax team had won, and the
roadies had finished a lengthy
soundcheck, the Producers
showed that they were worth
the money. The band played
two nine song sets that were
tight and well executed. Songs
featured were from their first
album, an upcoming album,

(expected in the end of June),
and the cover song “A Hard
Days’ Night.”

Kyle Henderson shared
singing chores with Van Tem-:
ple.

The first set was luke-warm,
but the second set increased in
pace and quality. In the second
set, the crowd was more ap-
preciative and active either due
to growing interest or their fifth
beer. The band played songs in-
cluding ‘‘I Love Lucy,”’ ‘‘Life of
Crime,” and ‘“‘Here’s to You”’ as
well as new songs such as
“Operation,’”’ ‘‘Heat,’’ and
‘Merry Go Round.” Henderson
and Temple attracted the au-
diences attention with shout
vocals and a bit of showman-
ship. After the band closed the
second set, they reappeared for
two encores, the best of which
was ‘‘A Hard Day’s Night”’, that
left a great impression in
everone’s mind of the Pro-
ducers.

Dorm Renovation Could End By Junel

Bass Co.
Calls Job

‘Easiest’

by Rick Swagler

From the inside, the newly-
remodeled Graham-Lees dor-
mitory bears little resemblance
to the old structure. June 1 is
the projected completion date
for the $2.8 million renovation
which not only improves the liv-
ing conditions from previous
years, but also increases the

fire safety factor.
Concerning living conditions,

the structure will feature new
plumbing fixtures, doors, win-
dows, screens, and floor tiles.
The dorm will still be heated bv
the old radiators with the addi-
tion of a thermostat in each
room.

One of the biggest changes is
the construction of hallways
connecting the dorm’s three
wings. The building was:
originally constructed in three
separate sections with passage
between wings restricted to
emergencies.

Other conveniences include
water fountains in each hall and
phone outlets in most rooms.

Bill Wiseman, construction
superintendent for Bass Con-
struction, the firm in charge of
the renovation, said the dorm
remodeling was “‘one of the
easiest jobs we’ve had. We
didn’t have any problems at
all.”

Douglas Brady, projects
manager for the university,
said that the Bass Co. was
chosen by W&L because ‘‘we
had been pleased with the jobs
they’ve done for us in the past
with the University Library,
McCormick Hall, the Tucker
job, and 30 University Place.”’
Bass was given the job as
general contractor and, in turn,
took bids for subcontract work.

One factor making the work
easier is that fire codes govern-
ing old buildings are not par-
ticularly stringent. If an older
building is being renovated,
with its use to remain the same,
then it does not have to adhere
to the fire codes established for
newer buildings.

In the case of Graham-Lees,
the renovation has improved
the safety of the building to the
point that it will exceed even the
current standards for newly-
constructed edifices. This is ac-
complished through the exten-
sive use of smoke alarms and a
sprinkler system. Also ex-
ceeding the minimal require-
ment was the isolation of the
stairways for safer exits in
emergencies.

Lexington City Building In-
spector Leonard Reiss stated
that “‘the building is steel and
masonry construction, so it’s
almost fire-proof. The only

 

 

 

 

 

Renovation
Produces A
‘Taj Mahal’

 

“It’s like walking from the
ruins of Pompeii into the Taj
Mahal.” This was how Dean H.
Robert Huntley described the
transformation that has taken
place in the Graham-Lees Dor-
mitory.

Although the rent has been in-
creased to help pay for the
renovation, the dorm is ap-
parently destined to regain its
position as the most popular liv-
ing quarters on campus.

“Even when it was falling
down around our ears, it was
the most popular dorm. There is
an espirit de corps that exists in
the dorm,’”’ Huntley com-
mented, ©

 

| Facts About
Graham-Lees

The “new” dorm will hold 235
freshmen and 16 counselors. Of
these 235 freshmen, 163 will be
in single rooms and 72 will live
in doubles.

As was mentioned before,
rent has been increased. A
single in either Graham-Lees or
Gilliam will be $1,100 per year
while a double will cost $800 per
person. In Davis, a single will
‘| cost $1,200 while a double will
run at $850 per person. Because
of the opening of Graham-Lees,
freshmen will also not live off
campus. Davis will next year be
occupied by freshmen only,
with Baker being reserved for
law students.

The southwest corner of
Graham-Lees features facilities
for handicapped individuals.
Three singles have been reserv-
ed for handicapped students,
one of the rooms having a
private bathroom. A ramp for
students in wheelchairs is
located in the quad.

 

 

Huntley also noted that
refrigerators with a capacity of
2.5 cu. ft. will be allowed in the
dorms, but cooking will still be
forbidden.

Students should also be able
to find other alternatives to stu-
dying. “Unfortunately, 1
believe there will be facilities
for cable television throughout
the building,” Huntley com-
mented.

flammable materials are the
contents of the rooms.”
According to Brady, the
sprinkler system required a
large amount of piping in the
halls. To accomodate this, the

ceilings had to be lowered. The
lower ceiling, combined with
light-colored floor tiles, gives
the appearance of wider

The dorm building will still in-

clude the porch overlooking
Washington St., but the brick
benches in the quad will be
replaced with the wooden types
found around campus.

Probably the best news,

however, is the fact that con-
struction is two months ahead
of schedule, giving the universi-
ty plenty of time to furnish the
building before the freshmen
arrive next fall.

Nine Second Quarter Goals Down Hofstra

by John Harrison

The regular season for the
Washington and Lee. lacrosse
team comes to an end this
Saturday as they meet the
University of Maryland-
Baltimore County at 2 p.m. on
Wilson Field.

Head coach Richard Watts’
squad is led by senior
defensemen George McGeeney
and Scott Hundertmark, goalie
Matt Christian and midfielder
Craig Tucker.

On offense, the Retrievers are
‘a real isolation team and will
draw the ball in the slot,”’ offers
W&L intern assistant coach
Eric Kemp. ‘“‘they’re like some
club teams that force the ball in
the crease. They concentrate on
getting the ball to Tucker,”
Kemp adds.

Although U.M.B.C. is not
ranked in the U.S.I.L.A. poll,
the Retrievers led or were tied
with UVa for over three
quarters a week ago Wednes-
day before they lost, 9-8, in the
final three minutes.

Last Saturday the Generals

routed Hofstra 19-10 before 3,800

Wilson Field fans. W&L used a
9-0 blitz in the second quarter to
put the game out of reach for

The Military

the Flying Dutchmen.

Explained head coach Jack
Emmer, ‘‘We expected a tough,
physical team but it didn’t hap-
pen. They didn’t appear to be a
good road team.”

Seniors Rob Staugaitis and
John Sancilio used the match to
get themselves in W&L records.
Staugaitis’ seven assists (four
came in the decisive second
quarter) tied the mark set by
Ted Bauer in 1974 and Don Car-
roll a year later. The attackman
added a goal in the second
quarter and three more assists
in the second half to raise his
team-leading point total to 48.

Sancilio’s three second
quarter goals gave him 32 for
the season and broke the school
record for goals by a midfielder
in one year. ‘I think when you
look back at some of the mid-
dies we’ve had in the past, you
can really appreciate what he’s
done,”’ said Emmer.

The Generals were also led by
John Doub (five goals, one
assist), Lee’ Heimert and Jeff
Mason (three goals each), and
senior Mike Schuler (four
assists).

during the second quarter,

coach Emmer was pleased with
the team’s ability to hold on to
the ball and get it to the open

Generally Speaking

 

Considering Rain, Game

by G. Bruce Potter
Many people who saw
Washington and Lee destroy
Hofstra in lacrosse last Satur-
day said that the game was not
very good, even from the
Generals’ standpoint.

I beg to differ.
Keeping in mind the weather
(intermittent downpours

throughout the first half), the

Generals did a good job once-

they got off the ground after a
sluggish start that saw Hofstra

tally two quick goals in the first
2:12 of the contest.

However, Washington and
Lee really could not be held at
fault for the second goal. They
were in a “‘red-dog’”’ defense
that had two players on the man
with the ball and goalie Ware
Palmer covering another
player, thus leaving the net
open. Palmer -had no chance
when Hofstra got the ball in
play successfully.

he said. “Our schedule could

though, lost to Washington Col-
lege and Syracuse lost to Cort-

Was Good

Head Coach Jack Emmer
seems to have come up with
another gem (don’t worry, I
won’t mention the ‘‘Ar-
madillo”) with this special
defense as it did work the other
three times the squad tried it
during last Saturday’s game.

Hofstra players were forced
to hurry the ball, and Wash-
ington and Lee was able to gain
possession.

The Generals went on to blow
the game wide open in the se-
cond period by tallying nine
goals, three of them by John
Sancilio. However, they then
became rather complacent in
the third quarter, and, with
freshman John DiDuro in the
goal, gave up five goals as the
game was very suddenly much
closer.

When it counted down the
stretch, W&L scored five
straight goals to open the final
quarter and put the game out of
reach. It was truly a game that
the Generals controlled most of
the way except for the first few
minutes and the majority of the
third quarter. However, one
must remember that Emmer
had played everyone on the
roster except DiDuro before
halftime.

Quotes-Of- The- Year

From Heavenly Thanks

 

Doubleheader Split
Ends Baseball’sY ear

 

To Fallon’s SI Quote

by G. Bruce Potter
Coaches, athletes and fans are supposed to come
up with witty remarks now and then, and this year
has been no exception at Washington and Lee. Ac-
cordingly, here are the quotes-of-the-year for
1981-82:

“Bridgewater will have fire coming out of their
nostrils’’. nr

—Head basketball coach
Verne Canfield before a crucial
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference contest.

“ don’t count on anybody until they are suited
up and running.”’

—Dick Miller cross-country
coach, on recruiting.

‘“‘But regardless of swimming in our own pool,
we’ll still be little fish in a big state pond.”’

—Page Remillard, swimming
coach, before his team hosted
the state swimming meet.

“Tm trying to feel my way out of our quarter-
back problem. I feel the best way to do this is to
look at all of our talent.’’

—Head football coach Gary
Fallon, after using five dif-
ferent quarterbacks in a 20-7
season-opening loss to Gettys-,
burg.

‘‘At about 2-14 miles, we crested a hill and Coach
Miller and the West Virginia Tech coach were
standing there. Neither of them said a word. I:
think the West Virginia Tech coach was in awe.
We asked Coach Miller (after the meet) why he
didn’t yell, and he said, ‘What can you say when
you have all your guys way ahead of their top guy,
and you’re only halfway through the race?”

—Frank Pittman describing
an incident in a cross-country
meet with West Virginia Tech, a
team the Generals shut out
15-47.
“The other regions all became very squeamish.

They only wanted representatives from their

region (as apposed to an at-large team from
across the country). That killed Washington and

Lee.”’ :
—Montclair State athletic

director William P. Dioguardi -

explaining why W&L didn’t
qualify for the NCAA Division
III basketball tournament. .

“I would not want to be this water polo team on

Monday. —Remillard, who also

coaches water polo, warns that
his team had better not lose all
three games at the upcoming
Bucknell Tournament.

“They ran faster than we did.”

—Miller’s enlightenting com-
ment on why his team lost to
Lynchburg in a cross-country
meet.
“It means something for other teams to beat
us.”’
—Canfield explaining his
teams poor road performance.
“If you’re gonna like sports, this is a good place
to like them.”
—W&L sports
director Ken Ries.

“Thank God for lacrosse.”

—An anonymous fan during

information

the Generals’ first football
game, a 20-7 loss to Gettysburg
College.

“We needed a Reggie Jackson-type incident and
this could be it. I think the team will rally around
it.”

—After a water polo player
had left campus for personal
reasons, Remillard remained
confident.

“Prospects are not just going to walk onto the
campus; they’re not going to just show up. We’ve
got to go out and make sure they’re aware of our,
lacrosse program, our academic programs
because they’re good ones — and sell the universi-

ty.’

—Head lacrosse Coach Jack

Emmer on recruiting.

“At a big meet like VMI, one has to set a goal
and stick with it. Anything beyond that is gravy.”
—Assistant Indoor Track Coach
Frank Miriello before the
ODAC Championships at VMI.

“At least we play Virginia.’

—At the lacrosse game
against William and Mary in
Williamsburg on April 13, a
W&L fan responded to an In-
dian fan’s charge that “You
guys don’t stand a chance
against Virginia.”’

“Next thing you know, they’ll be asking for
soap.”

—This quote by Fallon was
reprinted in Sports Illustrated
magazine and came after his
players complained of a lack of
hot water.

“We’re not going to go out there and just play
the game and run up and down the field.”

—Emmer two days before us-
ing the “Armadillo” slowdown
against the University of North
Carolina.

Washington and Lee’s
baseball squad closed out its
season Saturday by splitting a
doubleheader with Christopher
Newport to finish with a 9-20
record.

The Generals turned in an all-
around superb performance in
their opening game — an 11-5
win. W&L collected 14 hits in the
game with junior Jim Daly rip-
ping four hits and classmate
Chris Cavalline belting a solo
home run. Freshman Billy
White picked up the win for the
Generals.

W&L lost a 1-0 heart-
wrencher in the second game,
wasting a fine pitching effort by
senior Rich Hachenberg.
Hachenberg yielded only three
hits and one run, but the
Generals were scoreless despite
notching six hits and walking

and freshmen Miles Spencer
and Chip Hutchins.

While several underclassmen
improved, this was the last year
of collegiate baseball for nine
Generals. ‘“‘We’re losing some
super seniors,’’ Murdock
declared. Graduating starters
are Thad Ellis, Tripp Brower,
Jeff Haggerty, and Mark
McLaughlin. Lost from the
pitching corps will be David
Randall, Rich Hachenberg, Jim
Brockelman, Jim Stanley and
Don Dudley.

Statistically, junior Chris
Cavalline led the 1982 Generals
in batting with a .340 mark.
Cavalline also led the team with
four home runs. ;

Senior co-captains Jeff Hag-
gerty and Thad Ellis also had
fine seasons at the plate. Hager-
ty led the team in runs-batted-in
with 21, while batting .298 and

“We don’t play any ‘gimmes’
on our schedule. 7
I like a good, competitive schedule.”

   

Although W&L’s 9-20 record
appears completely unim-
pressive, the Generals played
an extremely rough schedule.
During the season W&L faced
Division I teams like Duke,
William & Mary and V.M.I. and
several Division II schools.

‘“‘We don’t play any ‘gimmes’
on our schedule,’’ noted Coach
Jim Murdock. “I like a good,
competitive schedule.”’

Although the season was not
as successful as expected, Mur-
dock pointed out some signs of
improvement. ‘‘Billy White was
a bright spot this year,’’ he said,
in reference to the freshman
pitcher who had W&L’s lowest
earned run average.

“The team defense was im-
proved and the offense also im-
proved a bit,’’ Murdock stated.

Murdock also observed im-
provement in several in-
dividuals. ‘“‘All the under-
classmen really developed this
‘year. Even some of the
freshmen showed develop-
ment,’’ Players Murdock sing-
led out as most improved were

with 17 and hit .269 with one
home run.

Freshman Billy White was
W&L’s leading hurler. White
had a 3.69 ERA and a 1-3 record
with one save.

Seniors David Randall and
Rich Hachenberg also had good
years on the hill. Randall was
3-3 with a 4.53 ERA and a team-
leading 37 strikeouts.
Hachenberg was 3-5 with a 5.19
ERA.

Murdock already expressed
optimism about next year’s
team. ‘‘We’ll be able to put a
returning letterman at every
position next year except first
base and catcher. We need
some pitching,’’ Murdock
stated in reference to the
decimation of the pitching corps
by graduation.

“I think we have a basis for
the coming years. We've
developed a leadership corps in-
stead of depending on one or
two kids like this year,’’ Mur-
dock optimistically asserted.

perhaps the most profoundly
moving willingness to suspend
easy moral judgment that the
history of cinema has yet
known. In the Neorealist direc-
tors, filmmakers like Roberto
Rossellini and Vittorio de Sica
who were active in Italy after
World War II, Ray found a
documentary-like receptivity to
the look of ordinary life.

Ray’s films are remarkable
for their warmth, understate-
ment, and visual harmony. In
Days and Nights in the Forest,
which is Ray’s favorite among

his own films, four men from

Magazine Review:

Political Magazine May

by R.W. Fenstermacher

At Washington and Lee, there
has been a long tradition of
political involvement on
various levels. Many of this
school’s alumni have had
political careers. Quadrenially
since 1908, participants in the
Mock Convention have attemp-
ted to predict (with quite a bit of
success) the out-of-office par-
ty’s candidate for the presiden-
tial elections. Now, there is the
Washington and Lee Political
Review.

In a footnote, editors-in-chief
Eric Anderson and David Black
explain that the purpose of the
new magazine ‘‘is to provide a
forum for the _ politically
aware.”’ The Review itself ‘‘has
no particular ideological bias,”
rather the editors’ goal is ‘‘ex-
cellence in expression, not
ideological purity.”

Articles appear on various
topics. The topics range from
the Equal Rights Amendment
and Social Security to the Polish
and Palestinian situations.
Special contributions come
from Clark Mollenhoff
(Reagan, Watt and Executive
Privilege) and visiting law pro-
fessor Richard Tyler (Reflec-
tions on the E.R.A.”’).

Although the magazine is sup-

Pryor ——

(continued from page 3)
ny.

However, the film is not total-
ly filled with only jokes and
devoid of any “‘message’’ in-
deed there are several strong
ones. Two especially strong
scenes have Pryor talking
about his trip to Africa, and his
battle with cocaine addiction.
While presented in a humorous
manner, they still have much to
say.
The film lasts about 90
minutes, a little longer than his
first concert film, and packs a
stronger punch. The old Pryor
is there, still as funny as ever,
but now there is something
more which really makes this
film expressive as well as
hilarious.

After an article in Time
magazine, a woman wrote into
the journal complaining that
anyone who used so many ‘“‘dir-
ty words” should not even be
allowed to make movies. Ob-
viously, such a woman has pro-
bably never seen this movie.
While there are ‘‘dirty words’’,
they serve a purpose and in this
movie, that final purpose is ad-
mirable.

Pryor is funny but, moreover,
he is effective. He has learned
that the best time to break
through that all too thick a bar-
rier of prejudice is to attack
when the defenses are lowest.
Therefore while the audience is
busy laughing over one of
Pryor’s stories, that message
slips in behind the laughter to
work little by little at the bar-

Have Too Limited Range

posed to have no ideological
bias, there appear no articles
which one can say were written
from a conservative outlook.
The articles present middle-of-
the-road to liberal views. Con-
sidering how conservative W&L
is said to be, I found this startl-
ing. Others have reacted
Similarly. ‘‘Awfully
Democratic” and ‘I wouldn’t
have paid $2.50 for it’? were two!
responses. Another person said,
“Tf I’d wanted to read ‘The New
Republic,’ I'd have bought it.’’
That was one disappointment |
had. Perhaps members of the
College Republicans can be en-
couraged to submit articles for
future issues so that a greater
spectrum of views can be
presented to the readers.

The magazine does fulfill the
editors’ goal, however, in that
the articles are fairly well writ-
ten. If the quality of this issue is
indicative of the quality of
future issues, The Review will
be a success. But I would like to
see a broader spectrum of
views presented. I encourage
more conservative members of
the W&L community to submit
articles so that the magazine
does not become another col-
legiate “‘New Republic.”

rier of prejudice.
Hopefully, the message will
remain long after Pryor’s joke

is forgotten.

Plus/Minus

by John Cleghorn

‘Under new university rules, a
Washington and Lee student
will be able to conceivably
graduate with a 4.33 grade
average.

In a new grading system that
will take effect in September
1983, plus and minus notations
will be added to grades which
deserve such clarification. A
plus will add .33 to the grade-
point and a minus will subtract
.33 from the grade given for a
course. Thus an A plus will be
marked 4.33 and an A- 3.67.

done by the Committee on
Courses and Degrees. Before

Students Kicked Out Of Twin Falls

by Scott Mason

Eighteen Washington and Lee
undergraduate students were
issued summonses to appear in
court after allegedly trespass-
ing on private property located
at the Twin Falls area.

At approximately 3 p.m. on
Thursday, May 13, the 18
students ventured to Twin
Falls, a large swimming hole
situated about six miles from
the W&L campus. Once there,
the group began swimming at a
spot below the falls’ cliffs when,
shortly thereafter, a man and
two Rockbridge County Deputy
Sheriffs appeared.

According to Alexander
Campbell, a’ W&L sophomore
and member of the group, the

complaintant, Carey S. Mackey
of R.F.D. 1 in Buena Vista, told
the boys that they were
trespassing on private proper-
ty. Mackey then indicated that
he had posted two ‘‘no trespass-
ing” notices on the grounds.
Campbell has since claimed,
however, that the signs were
camouflaged by foliage and
none of the group members had
noticed them.

Mackey, Campbell claims,
told the boys that several
students from the Virginia
Military Institute had, the
previous afternoon, been swim-
ming naked and caused a
general stir. Campbell said that
Mackey claimed that one of the
Keydets had engaged in sexual

intercourse on Mackey’s land,

“We are victims of cir-
cumstance,’’ Campbell said.
“The incident of the previous
day provoked such action. We
are merely being used as an ex-
ample.”

Court date is set for Fri., May
21 and, said Campbell, ‘I am
going to plead ‘not guilty.’ ’”’ In
addition to the signs having
been inadequately posted,
Campbell claims that people
have been swimming at Tein
Falls for years without any pro-
blems.

Mackey could not be reached

for comment.
Six VMI students received

summonses for trespassing the
following day.

 

System Adopted University Celebrating

Fund-Raising Success

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will celebrate the success of
its recently-completed $67-
million development program
with a series of events on the
campus this weekend (May 21
‘and 22) coinciding with the.
‘spring meeting of the universi-
ty’s board of trustees.

At 4p.m. on Friday (May 21),
there will be a ceremony in Lee
Chapel featuring remarks by
U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Lewis F. Powell Jr., a trustee
emeritus of Washington and
Lee; James M. Ballengee of
Philadelphia, Pa., rector of the
university’s board of trustees;
and, Robert E.R. Huntley,

president of the university.

On Saturday (May 22) at
11:30 a.m., John P. Fishwick,
former president of the Norfolk
& Western Railway Company,
will be the principal speaker at
dedication ceremonies for the
Commerce School Building.

Formerly the  university’s
library building, the Commerce
School Bulding was renovated
and remodeled at a cost of $3.5
million in 1979-80 after W&L had
moved into its new  under-
graduate library building.

Electrician Hospitalized
After Receiving Shock

by Jehn Cleghorn

An electrician was hospital-
ized with minor burns Friday
after he was shocked by a 7200-
volt power line.

Phillip Sutphin, 26, an em-
ployee of Southeastern Electric
in Roanoke, received the shock
when he accidentally cut into
the power line. The mishap,
which took place around 11:30
a.m. Friday morning, happened
in a manhole just south of the
University Library and near
Reid Hall. Underground power
lines were being prepared at
that time to be shut off the next
day for repairs.

A volunteer rescue squad ar-
rived approximately 20 minutes
after the incident and took the
victim to Stonewall Jackson:

Hospital. sutphin was stabilized
in Lexington before he was
transferred to Roanoke to be
treated for minor burn damage.

The work being done was part
of a project completed last
weekend to replace faulty
power lines on both the north
and south ends of the campus.
Two weeks ago, the lines on the
south end were replaced and
electricity was off seven hours
Saturday as the north-end lines
were installed.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Plus/Minus

In a move that is believed to make the university’s
grading system more comparable to those of other
schools, the faculty of Washington and Lee has ap-
proved a measure that places “‘plus’’ and ‘“‘minus”’
notations on certain grades.

The argument in favor of the move is that plus and
minus grading would give officials at other schools a
better understanding of the student’s work. This, in
theory, would help a W&L student when he is applying
for a graduate school. But does this really give the
student such an advantage?

Under the new system, the difference between a
plus and a minus grade is only one-third of a grade-
point per credit. If a student were taking a three
credit course, for example, the difference between a
C plus and a B- would be minimal in figuring out the
grade point average. Where the difference between a
C plus and a B- was once three grade points, it will
now be only one point. The effort to make a B- rather
than a C plus will likely be a matter of pride, more
than anything else.

The system does have its rewards, however. By
finishing with a ‘‘plus’ mark, the student will get
more points than he previously did. This makes the A’
plus, for example, especially gratifying. But by get-
ting an A-, the student is penalized a third of a grade
point. The system thus has its own plusses and
minuses. While it rewards good work, it contains a
few pitfalls that cause almost unfair losses of grade
points.

The university had the right idea in trying to make
its grading system compatible to ther schools. Let’s
hope the idea doesn’t backfire.

to the world.”’

Sparks received his law
degree from the Washington
and Lee University School of
Law in 1932.

After establishing a law prac-
tice in his native Louisiana,
Sparks volunteered for World

. War II naval service, serving

with distinction in torpedo
squadrons aboard two aircraft
carriers, primarily the U.S.S.
Yorktown. He left the Navy
with the rank of lieutenant com-
mander, but his lifelong devo-
tion to his service and his ship
led.him to the honor of being
chairman of the board of the
U.S.S. Yorktown Foundation.
Following the war, he became
a successful lawyer, with the
Monroe firm of Thompson,
Sparks & Cudd, an active

businessman, and an undefeat-
ed state senator in Louisiana.
He has been involved with
Washington and Lee through his
participation on several alumni
committees.

Sproul, who graduated from
Washington and Lee in 1937,
was cited for his ‘‘distinguished
record of achievement and
leadership in military service,
the world of business, civic af-
fairs, and education.”

In addition to 28 years with
the Virginia National Guard
and as last commander of the
famed 29th “Blue and Gray,”
Sproul served five years on ac-
tive duty during World War II
and an additional five years on
regular Army duty attending

‘schools and conferences. He

commanded Assault Company
in the 116th Infantry Regiment
on Omaha Beach, for which he
received the Distinguished Ser-
vice Cross.

In 1966 Sproul organized the
Virginia International Com-
pany, which is involved with the
development of oil and gas pro-
duction in Indonesia.

Sproul’s leadership in civic
activities, which include the
Chamber of Commerce, United
Fund, and the Woodrow Wilson
Foundation, prompted his
selection in 1954 as Man of the
Year for Augusta County and
Staunton.

Library Receives Book Collection

A Baltimore, Md., couple has
given the Washington and Lee
University Library an impor-
tant collection of almost 1,200
books and exhibition catalogs
concerning late 19th-and early
20th-century art.

Ellen and Alvin Aisenberg
presented the books which they
collected over the past 30 years.
Mr. Aisenberg is an alumnus of
Washington and Lee.

A selection of books from the
Aisenberg Collection is current-
ly on display in the Boatwright
Rare Book Reading Room in the
University Library. The display
is open to the public from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. Monday through Fri-
day.

A bibliography of the collec-
tion, edited by Richard W.
Oram and Priscilla B. Lewis of
the library staff, is available at
no charge.

Approximately one quarter of
the Aisenberg Collection is com-
posed of works on French artist
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. The
collection includes a_ multi-
volume catalog of his complete
drawings and an _ extensive
group of critical works and
biographies of Lautrec.

“This collection is by no
means a survey of the history of
modern art,’”’ Mr. and Mrs,
Aisenberg wrote in describing
their gift. “It is rather a per-
sonal collection which stresses

those figures. which have.

especially appealed to us:
Lautrec’ Degas, Schiele and
Modigliani.

“We feel that it has sufficient
depth to stimulate those
students involved in research;
it should also be useful to those
who are simply interested in ex-
amining exhibition catalogs of
their favorite artists.”

University Librarian Maurice
D. Leach Jr. said that the
Aisenbergs’ gift ‘‘adds a
distinguished _ reference
resource to the University
Library. Each member of the
Washington and Lee communi-
ty is indebted to them for shar-
ing with us this very carefully
selected and rich collection.”

SPE’s, FIJI’s Receive
Fines For May 8 Melee

by John Cleghorn

Washington and Lee students
Russell Rosler and Drew Clark
appeared in Lexington General
District Court Tuesday on
counter charges of destruction
of property.

Judge Joseph Hess fined
Clark $100 on each of three
counts and Rosler on one count.
Clark also received a ten day
sentance which was suspended
and is responsible for paying
resttution to Rosler.

The charges are a result of a
clash that took place on May 8
in the yards of the Sigma Phi
Epsilon and Phi Gamma Delta
fraternities.

The Interfraternity Council

also reviewed the incident Tues-
day in its meeting. After hear-
ing testimony form the involved
parties, the council ruled to,
place Phi Gamma Delta on)
social probation beginning Oct.
8.

** It was basically a SPE/Figi
incident,’’ remarked IFC Presi-
dent Mason Ellerbe. ‘‘There are
always individuals involved but
it was fraternity related.’’

‘There had been another inci-
dent in the fall between the two
houses which received an in-
definite penalty,’’ added
Ellerbe explaining the severity
of the penalty. ‘“‘That was aj
large consideration we took in|
making our decision.”

Don’t Allow The Sun To Set
On WEL Division I Lacrosse

by Bruce Potter

As the sun set behind Wilson Field last Satur-
day, a solitary jogger was plodding his way
around the track, still neatly lined from the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference track champion-
ships.

His footsteps echoed in the now-empty stands
that three hours previously had been packed with
fans cheering Washington and Lee to a 19-8
lacrosse victory over the University of Maryland
in Baltimore County.

Back on the field, the lacrosse nets had been
removed, and the football goalposts, glistening in
the day’s last light, seemed to have regained their
prominence. The only memories of a recently-
completed lacrosse season were the restraining,
mid-field and out-cf-bounds lines and the areas
at midfield and the goals where the grass had long’
disappeared.

As the Generals lacrosse team closed their 13th
consecutive winning season with a 9-4 record, one
question that may become a topic of debate during
the hot, summer months is whether or not the sun
has set on Division I lacrosse at Washington and
Lee.

Now, this is not to imply that W&L should sud-
denly begin awarding athletic scholarships, a
disastrous move that would drastically alter the
character of the university.

Nor should the Generals drop to Division III in
lacrosse. But many discusions will be held on this
subject, especially after the humbling W&L
received from the University of Virginia and their
use of a slowdown offense to avoid a similar troun-
cing from the University of North Carolina.

And those who want to see Division III lacrosse
at Washington and Lee will be well-armed with
many other arguments.

For example, the Generals have not made the
NCAA playoffs for three of the last four years, and
their last decent showing in that prestigious event
came in 1975, when they advanced to the semi-
finals for the third straight year before losing to
Maryland.

Since then, the Generals have been drubbed by
Cornell twice, 14-0 in 1976 and 12-2 in 1978. They
also lost to Maryland in 1977 by a 14-8 count, and to
Syracuse in 1980 by a score of 12-4.

The last time a Washington and Lee team lost
less than four games in a season came in 1974,
when they entered the NCAA playoffs with a
spotless record before bowing to Johns Hopkins
11-10 in the semifinals.

Yet, the major argument in favor of remaining
in Division I in lacrosse is that there are con-
sistently three or four teams (UNC, UVA, Johns
Hopkins, and normally Maryland or Cornell),
that, barring upsets and “‘Armadillos,’’ rank one
step above the rest. And it is into this category that
Washington and Lee currently falls, along with the
Navys, Syracuses, Rutgers, Towson States,
Massachusetts, and Adelphis.

To post a 9-4 record playing against Division I
scholarship opponents is no mean feat in itself. To
do so without giving scholarships and with str-
ingent admission requirements is something else
altogether.

True, given the choice of attending North
Carolina on a full scholarship or W&L, where only
financial aid is available for those who can prove
they qualify, the average top prospect will have no
problem in picking the Heels.

But as long as W&L plays Division I lacrosse,
head coach Jack Emmer can tell a potential
recruit that the Generals face virtually the same
schedule as most of the top schools and don’t have
to sacrifice academics to do it.

Also favoring Division I lacrosse at Washington
and Lee is the fact that, currently, lacrosse is the
only sport that garners a significant amount of
campus interest. This may be due to the fact that
the season coincides with Spring term, but, more
likely, it is because everyone enjoys watching the
Generals battle, and sometimes defeat, the best
lacrosse teams in the nation. Who doesn’t like an
underdog?

Emmer has been quoted in the media as saying
that he feels there is some campus sentiment
towards switching to Division III to lacrosse. If so,
it has yet to manifest itself.

However, with the conclusion of this year’s cam-
paign, a meeting will be held among Emmer,
athletic director Bill McHenry, President Hunt-
ley, and the faculty athletic committee to, in Em-
mer’s words, ‘‘evaluate the thing (lacrosse pro-

Freshman Sandy Brown eludes U.M.B.C.’s Craig Tucker to fire a

 

shot at goalie Tim Murphy in Saturday’s action.

by John Harrison

In the season finale for both
schools, the Washington and
Lee lacrosse team handily
dispatched Maryland-Balti-
more County 19-8 Saturday in
front of 1,900 Wilson Field fans.

The Generals took a 6-0 lead
in the first ten minutes with the
help of two goals by freshman
Jeff Mason and were never
pressured after that.

Other key contributors for
W&L were starting goaltender
Phil Aiken (who allowed just
five goals and sixteen shots in
three quarters), John Doub and
senior Rob Staugaitis. Doub’s
six goals fell one short of W&L’s
single-game record.

Staugaitis closed out his
career with a pair of assists and
a goal. The two assists gave him
36, the fourth straight season he
has led the team in that
category. Perhaps even more
impressive was the at-
tackman’s four-year total of
119, which places him second on
the alltime W&L list behind Don
Carroll’s 129 (1973-1977).

the season on a strong note,”’
said head coach Jack Emmer.

UMBC played without its
leading scorer, sophomore mid-
fielder Mark Gold, who was out
with an undisclosed injury.

“It was a surprise Gold didn’t
play,” said Emmer, “‘but we’ve
been through that (injury)
situation, too. Without their top
player, the Retrievers were
“sloppy. They didn’t show the
capability they did to play
Virginia 9-8,” added the coach.

Even though the Generals did
not receive a bid to the NCAA
tournament, Emmer was ex-
tremely pleased with the team’s
ability to cope with one of the
most ambitious schedules in
W&L history.

“People were worried about
us being competitive. It was a
real good year, finishing 9-4
when most people were picking
us for 4-9.”

Beyond the record itself, the
coach was equally satisfied
with the team’s attitude and its
ability to play as a unit.

“It left a positive feeling. Our
kids gave us a good effort all the
way down the line. We really
worked together as a team,’’ he
pointed out.

“It was a pleasure to be
associated with them. This was
as good as any team I’ve
worked with,” said Emmer,

Going Out On A Limb
Predictions, Prognostications For ’82-’83

by G. Bruce Potter

As this school year moves rapidly
towards a close, let’s gaze into our crystal
ball and take a month-by-month look at
what will take place in the world of
Washington and Lee sports next year:

September

In order to avoid being hit in the face
with a cream pie at the Muscular
Dystrophy Superdance, football coach
Gary Fallon decides that his team will not
have to undergo the tortuous ‘‘circuits”’
this season. Another factor in his decision
is that all of his senior quarterbacks have
graduated, so the pie would not be in-
tercepted.

Realistically, though, this may be the
year for Washington and Lee football.
Coming off an 8-2 record last year, the
team appears to be even stronger
(especially after spending all winter in the
weight room), and they will play their two
main ODAC rivals, Randolph-Macon and
Hampden-Sydney, at home.

October

The Generals cross-country team com-
plained about the actions of several Lyn-
chburg spectators in a meet at Lynchburg
last year. Well, Lynchburg comes to W&L
for a meet this year and head coach Dick
Miller re-routes the cross-country trail
through the freshman quad, so the Hornets
have extreme difficulty in dodging
lacrosse balls, frisbees, and beer bottles.

Afterwards, a reporter asks coach
Miller what his team did to win the race.
Miller’s response? ‘‘We ran faster than
they did.”’

November

After losing only one senior to gradua-
tion from last year’s 31-5 squad, the water
polo team finishes the regular season as
undefeated Southern League champions.
They manage to advance all the way to the
national finals (this is Division I,
remember) before losing to, you guessed
it, Slippery Rock State College of Penn-
sylvania.

December

As Washington and Lee opens its long-
awaited basketball campaign by winning
its first three games by a total of four
points and then losing two in a row before
going home for Christmas, the Ring-tum
Phi learns that Roanoke College has come
under investigation from the NCAA.

The Maroons, who finished in the top
eight in the nation in Division ITI last year,
appear stronger than ever, and four of
their five starters are freshmen or
sophomores. However, according to an all-
county guard from New York who signed
with Roanoke and then did not make the
squad, an alumnus offered him $1000.00
and a Hollins girl for attending this
esteemed institution of higher education.

January

Without eight-time all-American Mike
Bernot, who graduated, Page Remillard’s
swimming team is going nowhere fast this
year, and the wrestling team continues to
perform fairly well in relative mediocrity.

The only sure prediction that can be
made about January is that it will snow
and buildings and grounds will do their

The Ring-tum Phi, May 20, 1982, Page 5

usual poor job of keeping all the walkways
clear.
February

The Generals close their basketball
season or sO everyone assumes, with a
78-71 loss to Maryville in the opening round
of the Old Dominion Athletic Conference
tournament. The game ends with a Frank
Eppes’ dunk at the buzzer.

However, even though the squad has on-
ly posted a 15-11 record, the NCAA Divi-
sion III selection committee feels bad
about overlooking them for last year’s
tournament and selects the Generals for
this season’s championship tourney.

In related news, Roanoke is placed on a
two-year probation by the NCAA (no
televised games and no NCAA playoff ap-
pearances) for six recruiting violations.
However, the Maroons counter by apply-
ing for and receiving permission to move
to Division I in basketball.

March

Three years ago, Mike Schuler slammed
his finger in a door in a Baltimore hotel
room. Two years ago, Mike Pressler sat on
a defective chair and ended up with a six-
inch splinter in his posterior. Last year,
back up goalie Mark Lukes was hit in the
neck with a lacrosse ball and missed the
rest of the season. The only question that
remains for this year is which member of
the lacrosse team will be injured and what
form the freak injury will take.

Meanwhile, the Washington and Lee
basketball team is a surprise participant
in the NCAA Division III final four *Under

the motivation of head coach Verne Can-
field, the Generals have rebounded from
an unexpectedly sluggish season to finish
on a high note.

April

Spring sports shorts:

The W&L golf team wins all six dual
matches to up its record to 22-0 in that area
over the past three years...

Facing all Division I opponents, the ten-
nis squad posts a 3-19 regular season
record, but comes back to place second in
the ODAC championships behind
Hampden-Sydney......

After losing all of its pitchers, save Billy
White, to graduation, the baseball team
averages scoring nine runs a game. Unfor-
tunately, they give up ten runs a game and
plod their way to the standard 11-17 record,
just missing the ODAC tournament...

Everyone predicts great things for the
track team this year, and they come
through by winning ODAC champion-
ships...

And in lacrosse...

May

The Generals move quietly along to their
usual (at least in the last few years) 8-4
record.

Quietly, that is, except for one incident.
When the University of Virginia visits
Wilson Field, Emmer has a trick up his
sleeve. First, he places noted par-
ticipatory journalist George Plimpton in
the goal, and then he comes up with a new,
legal slowdown offense called the ...

Eight women’s sports will be

swimming, fencing, tennis,
lacrosse, and horseback riding.

Entertainment
‘Scapino’ And Spaghetti Mix Well

In addition to nightly perfor-
mances of the musical-comedy
adaptation of what was
originally a Moliere play, the
“Scapino” audiences literally

get a taste of the play’s setting

 

The chef for Washington and Lee’s ‘Spaghetti Theatre,’’ Robert J.
de Maria, prepares his specialty for the nightly performance of
**Scapino” at the Troubadour Theatre.

Short story writer Peter Taylor, center, Commonwealth Professor
of English, leads a seminar at Washington and Lee University.
Taylor was at W&L under the auspices of the Glasgow Endowment
Committee. At right is Washington and Lee English professor
James Boatwright, editor of Shenandoah, the university's literary
magazine.

 

thanks to the culinary talents of
Robert J. de Maria, an assistant
professor of journalism at
W&L.

‘‘Scapino,”’ directed by W&L
journalism instructor Paula
Langdon, is set in an Italian
restaurant in Naples during the
1950s.

In efforts to make the setting
as realistic as possible, the
theatre enlisted de Maria’s ser-
vices.

The result is what has been
labeled ‘‘Spaghetti Theatre.”

Each evening’s performance
of ‘‘Scapino”’ begins with a gen-
uine Italian dinner prepared by
de Maria and served on the set
of the play.

Since the configuration of the
theatre has had to be adapated
to a dinner-theatre format, at-
tendance for ‘“‘Scapino” has
been limited to about 50 for each
performance.

But for all those who were
unable to get a seat, there may
be one way to enjoy at least part
of the ‘‘Spaghetti Theatre’ ex-
perience — that is, to cook the
spaghetti.

To that end, the following is
the recipe for ‘‘de Maria’s Sun-
day Sauce’’:

de MARIA’S
“SUNDAY SAUCE”
1 tbs. oregano
1 tbs. sweet basil
1 tsp. fennel seed
1 tsp. crushed red pepper
salt & pepper to taste
grated Parmesan cheese
2 cloves of garlic (crushed)
1/4 cup olive oil
2 large cans tomatoes (20 0z
ea.)
16 0z. can tomato paste
12 oz. red wine
1/2 onion diced
11b. pork
In a large sauce pan, put olive
oil and add fennel, garlic, basil,
red pepper, onion. Add tomato
and cook over low heat. Allow to
simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.
Cover and cook for 1 to 2 hours,
stirring at regular intervals.
After 2 hours, add tomato paste
and wine and cook uncovered
for 30 minutes, then add pork
(or other meat as your palate
dictates). Add meatballs (see
recipe below) and cook until
thick. This sauce is better when
served one day later after ‘ag-
ing’ overnight.
MEATBALLS
1 lb. ground beef
1/2 lb. ground pork
legg
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1/4 cup olive oil
Put ingredients in a bowl, then
add 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp.
oregano, 1 tsp. sweet basil, 1/2
tsp. crushed red pepper, and 1/2
tsp. fennel seed. Mix together
until blended, then form into
small meat balls. Fry in oil until
lightly brown on all sides. Add
sauce. Enjoy.

Rush Forum Tonight

A public Rush forum will be
held tonight at 7:00 in the
Northen auditorium of the
Undergraduate Library. IFC
president Mason Elerbe and
Dean of Fraternity Affiars Dan
Murphy will be present to field
questions about the new Rush
calendar. The forum’s. purpose
is to help clear much of the con-
fusion surrounding the new
calendar as well as to provide
an opportunity for students to
voice opinions about rush and

Grades

freshmen orientation. A new
and extensive orientation pro-
gram for entering freshmen is
being planned and student ideas
from all classes, fraternity
members and independents are
actively sought. Ellerbe
welcomes the forum and en-
courages student participation
to help correct inaccuracies
reported in the last month about
the new calendar and to help
ease freshman transition into a
shorter and more open Rush.

 

(continued from page 1)
under the upcoming plan.

The Committee listed four
chief reasons for the
changeover. First, the Commit-
tee report stated that ‘‘with 13
grades rather than five, there
can be a more accurate reflec-
tion as to the quality of the stu-
dent’s work.”’

Second, the report maintains
“‘the student owuld benefit by a
distinction between high and
low in the same grade-letter
range.”

The committee also endorsed
the system because it is used on
a national level. Finally, the
report reads that the system
will enable students to be com-
pared more directly to other
students in applying to law
school as the Law School Data
Assembly Service also
recognizes the plus and minus
system,

Pass-fail courses will not be
affected by the system as they
do not have any consequence in
computing grade-point
averages.

A midterm F plus will be
granted to students in courses
in which the professor believes.
the work can be raised to pass-
ing standards.

The faculty asked the Courses

and Degrees Committee to
study the proposal in the April
meeting having just turned in
Winter term grades. A study
done five years earlier of a plus-
minus system was revised and
passed in the May faculty
meeting.

The members of the Courses
and Degrees Committee are
Dean William Watt,
(Chariman) Dean Edward At-
wood, Dr. Leonard Jarrard,
Dr. Robert McAhren, Dr. Jay
Cook, Dr. Albert Gordon,
Prof. Buford Stephenson, Dr.
Edgar Spencer and two student
members.

Baseball

Senior Thad Ellis and junior
Chris Cavalline were selected to
the second-team all-ODAC
baseball squad announced last
week.

Ellis, an outfielder, hit .269
with one home run and 17 runs-
batted-in.

A second baseman, Cavalline
led the Generals in hitting at
.340, in slugging percentage at
.560, and in homers with four.
He also drove in 16 runs during
Washington and Lee’s 9-20

Lecture Addresses Medical Ethics

Dr. James F. Childress, pro-
fessor of religious studies and
medical education at the
University of Virginia, will pre-
sent a lecture entitled ‘Per-
sonal Conscience and Profes-
sional Roles” at 8 p.m. on Fri-
day (May 21) in Classroom E of
Lewis Hall, the Washington and
Lee University law school
building.

The lecture is sponsored by
Washington and Lee’s program
in applied ethics, “Society and
the Professions,”’ and is being
given in connection with the
eighth annual Medical Ethics
Institute.

Childress, who joined the
faculty of the University of
Virginia in 1968, is the author of

Campus Made Available For Summer Programs

From | practice trials to
lacrosse to a program of contin-
uing education for elder
citizens, Washington and Lee
University’s campus will be a
busy place this summer.

According to Robert Fure, the
director of summer programs
at W&L, the _ university’s
facilities will be in use from
June 6 through August 7 for a
wide variety of conferences and
clinics.

Although Washington and Lee
does not conduct credit-
granting academic programs in
the summer, the university has
steadily been expanding the use
of its facilities and staff during
the summer months.

Included among the 13 dif-
ferent programs scheduled for
the W&L campus this summer
are two new ventures — an
alumni college and an elder-
hostel.

The inaugural session of the
W&L Alumni College will be
held June 27 through July 3 and
will involve 100 participants —
W&L alumni and their families

— in what is described as “a
week of reading, relaxation,
recreation, and reflection.”’

The theme for the Alumni Col-
lege is “Changing Views in
Changing Times.’’ Fure is the
program director while Sidney
M.B. Coulling, professor of
English at W&L, is the
academic director and Laura
de Maria is the director of the
junior program for the children
in attendance.

The faculty for the Alumni
College will be composed of
W&L professors Coulling, John
R. Handelman (politics),
Leonard E. Jarrard (psychol-
ogy), William A. Jenks
(history), and Thomas G. Nye
(biology).

In addition to daily lectures
and discussion groups, the par-
ticipants will be offered a varie-
ty of recreational opportunities
as well as optional learning pro-
grams that range from a ses-
sion on computers to classes in
photography, cooking, and
Chinese brush painting.

Noted author Tom Wolfe,

whose book “‘The Right Stuff”
will be one of the texts under
discussion, will make a presen-
tation to the college one even-
ing. Wolfe is a graduate of
W&L.

The other summer program
that is new this year at
Washington and Lee is the
elderhostel, part of a national
program designed for persons
60 years of age and over.

To be held from August 1

through August 7, W&L’s
elderhostel will involve 45 par-
ticipants who will take non-
credit courses to be taught by
Washington and Lee professors

Gerard Doyon (art), Robert
Stewart (music), and J.
Timothy Phillips (law).

Washington and Lee is one of
more than 500 colleges and
universities offering elderhostel
programs, which provide low-
cost, short-term residential
academic programs for older
adults.

Aside from the new offerings
on the agenda for this summer,
two of the programs are return-

ing for a second year after suc-
cessful beginnings last sum-
mer.

The Institute for Executives,
scheduled for June 13 through
June 26, will have an estimated
36 middle-level business ex-
ecutives who will be engaged in
two weeks of intense study in
the humanities.

Summer Scholars ’82,
scheduled for July 4 through Ju-
ly 30, is a month-long program
of rigorous, college- -level
academic work for students
who will be seniors in high
school this fall. The coeduca-
tional program is designed to
give college-bound high school
students an opportunity to sam-
ple college life.

The other programs on
Washington and Lee’s summer
schedule are athletic camps in
both lacrosse and basketball,
the National Institute for Trial
Advocacy’s Trial Practice
Clinic, the Rockbridge Schools
Fine Arts Workshop, the
American Academy of Judicial

Education conference, and a
conference of college and
university development  of-
ficers.

With Budget Talks

Rick Swagler

The Executive Committee
heard final reports from the
SAB, the Student Financial
Relations Committee (Cold
Check), the W&L Film Society,
th Rugby Club, the Ariel, and
Focus.

As expected, Randall Jacoby
reported that the SAB was
“once again in the hole.’’ The
estimated loss for this quarter
is around $2,000. Jacoby also
reported that the receipts from
the Michael Guthrie Band, ap-
proximately $500, had not been
deposited and were missing.
The E.C. questioned the prac-
tice of holding receipts, and
Bobby Schmidt explained that
they were used to pay the band

Rush: More Practical Professors Looking

Than Deferring Things |

by John Cleghorn

Mason Ellerbe, President. of
the IFC, and Dean Dan Murphy,
Assistant Dean of Students and
member of the Student Affairs
Committee; explained the fine
details of the new Rush calen-
dar at an open Rush forum
Thursday. The carefully design-
ed twenty-two day Rush they
presented is a better system
than those in the past as it re-
tains the crucially balanced
timing of contact, open houses
and. Rush dates while smoothly
compacting the calendar into a
tighter Rush that bows to
academic pursuits sooner.

Many alternatives have been

aired in the past months, the |

loudest of which was the issue of
a deferred rush. Although the
adopted system only shortens
rush four days, a difference
some might think inconsequen-

tial, the strength of the system

As the year winds down, so do
the professorships of at least
five Washington and Lee facul-
ty members.

Isabel Mcllvain, recipient of
a Ring-tum Phi award, will be
one of the two professors leav-
ing the art department. William
Rasmussen will be returning to
the Virginia Museum, where he
served until taking a one-year
leave of absence to teach at
W&L.

Professof Carren O. Kaston
will be leaving the English
department to return to her
home state of New York. She

‘has served as faculty adviser to

the Film Society during her
time at W&L.

Two other professors who are
retiring after a combined total
of 73 years at W&L will be
honored at the undergraduate
commencement exercises next
Thursday. They are Professors
Charles W. Williams of the
rfiath department and Charles
W. Turner of the history depart-
ment.

Williams received his
bachelor’s degree from Har-
vard, his master’s from the
University of Maryland, and his
Ph.D. from the University of
Virginia. He taught at W&L
from 1937-1939 and from 1948 to

Development Office Takes A Break After A Ten-Year Wait

by John Cleghorn
in the
| Washington and Lee Develop-
| ment office is one of a long
awaited relaxation, about ten
| years awaited.

With the development drive
celebration over, so is the final

‘stage of a funding drive that
was initiated in 1972. After
finishing the decade-long push
and ending five million over the

‘projected goal, the develop-
ment office has a moment to
breathe.

“I didn’t feel that the develop-
ment plan was over until after
this weekend,’ said Richard
Sessoms, Assistant Director of
Development for W&L. ‘We
were hoping for our supporters
to leave after this weekend with
qa real good feeling about their

support for the school,’ con-
tinued Sessoms, ‘‘I think they
left with a good taste in their
mouths.”’

Those supporters of which
Sessoms speaks of are specif-
ically those individuals, founda-
tions, and corporations most
responsible for the successful
completion of the 1972-1981
Development project, namely
those who have given $10,000 or
more. The agenda for the
weekend celebration started
with a ceremony Friday after-
noon featuring addresses by
U.S. Supreme Court Justice,
Lewis Powell; Rector of the
Roard of Trustees, James M

Ballengee; and Universty
President, Robert E.R.
Huntley.

After a short reception at the

Lee house at seven, the benefac-
tors dariced and dined in the
Warner Center to the sound of
Jack Diamond and Friends
admidst a recreation of the 1982
Fancy Dress ballroom.

Saturday, the group was
taken on tour of the recently
completed buildings on campus
that were made possible by
their donations to the Develo-
ment Project including the
library, the law school, and
Tucker and Newcomb halls.

The School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics was
dedicated later that afternoon
marked by a speech by former
Norfolk and Western Railway
President John P. Fishwick.
Fishwick said of the school that
“It is built on the foundation
that it recognizes that beyond

U.Va. and VMI.

the training and the jargon of
any particular business or pro-
fession, there is an underlying
requirement that men _ be
educated to be civilized peo-
ple...people who have explored
the liberal arts and who realize
that men everywhere seek to
know what it means to be
human.”

The celebration weekend
coincided with the meeting of
the University’s Board of
Trustees. In addition to 22 of the
24 members of the Board and
335 benefactors, 6 of 12 Trustees
Emeritus invited also attended
the celebration.

“It has been the Board that
has provided extraordinary

support and leadership
throughout the decade-long
fund drive,’’ commented

tober are Bryce Street, Bruce

iv. el

Olson and the Offenders, Skip.

Castro, the Bill Blue Band, and
Virginia Fire.

Jacoby also made the Student
Financial Relations Committee
Report. Jacoby commented,
“People are bouncing checks
like crazy.’’ The committee is
considering a change in the pro-
cedure for picking up checks
from merchants so_ that
students will be able to cash
checks up until the end of the
year.

The Ring-tum Phi Business
Manager, Trent Dickerson,
reported that the Phi could have
an $1,800 surplus if all
receivables are collected. He
noted that the Army owes the
paper $150, and the Navy owes
between $200 and $300.

Russell Clarke made the W&L
Film Society’s final report, say-
ing that they might have a
deficit of about $100.

Turner, another Phi award
recipient, received his
bachelor’s degree at the
University of Richmond, his
master’s at the University of
North Carolina, and his Ph.D.
at the University of Minnesota.
He has taught at W&L since
1946. He has published over 50
articles and 12 books, the most
famous being Chessie’s Road.
During his tenure at W&L, he
has introduced new courses to
the history department concer-
ning Far East Asia and the
American West. This year he
has received the William Webb

’ ding service and dedication to

1981-82: A Year Of Gains And Losses

It was a year of highs and
lows. Washington and Lee made
some impressive gains during
the 1981-82 academic year, but
also suffered a few ir-
replaceable losses. Here is a
month-by-month rundown of
what happened around campus
during the past year.

September

Though a_ short month,
September had a few instances
of controversy. To begin with,
the commonwealth legislature
decided to raise the legal drink-
ing age from 18 to 19, much to
students’ dismay (this was ac-
tually done over the summer).
To add to the misery, local law
enforcement agencies promised
to crack down on people caught
drinking illegally or in public.
People under the age of 21
caught consuming alcohol were
threatened with a first-class
misdemeanor charge. Anyway,
the threat panned out to be
nothing and people continued to
drink their merry way into obli-
vion. On the political front, the
Executive Committee was
sworn in with President Eric
Myers forgoing the usual in-
augural address and getting
right. down to business. The
business-like attitude of Myers
would become more evident in
the upcoming weeks as he cam-
‘paigned for constitutional
amendments. Also prevalent
during the first month was the
beginning of debate over the
current rush format for frater-
nities (the first six weeks of the
fall term). This proved to be a
debate that would carry on
through the final weeks of the
school year

October
October began with a
marathon budget hearing in the
E.C. room, the unpopular
choice of fiddler Vassar
lements as the featured per-
ormer at Homecoming, and
‘merchants worried about
thefts. The E.C. heard subcom-
mittee budget reports for a
perfectly dreadful eight hours
one Monday night. Meanwhile,
the Student Activities Board
alienated would-be beach and
soul lovers with the choice of

the earthy Clements. The E.C.

continued to dominate the news,

this time denying a request by
the Intervarsity Christian

Fellowship for a $400 piece of

the student budget. While the

I.V. controversy flared, the In-

terfraternity Council and its

president, Hall Vetterlein, of-
fered a compromise with the

Lexington Police Department

over the enforcement of noise

violations. In return for exten-
ding the amplified music

deadline from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.,

the I.F.C. promised that it

would enforce a stricter policy
of keeping houses litter-free. As
.of May, the compromise was
still being discussed. Perhaps
one of the problems was the

“mysterious” crash of a police

squad car in the War Memorial

gates in front of Ked Square.
While Lt. Torben Pedersen was
trying to tame a Sigma Nu
(more on them later) party, his
car rolled into the gates. When
he asked who ‘moved the car,
Pedersen was told it was done
by ‘‘A guy in khaki pants and a
button-down shirt.’”’ The parties
continued a week later at
Homecoming, where Katie Orr
of Hollins College was named
the queen. Controversy soon
switched from the E.C. over to:
the Ring-tum Phi, where
readers complained of the
papers prophylactic advert-
siements. Controversy then
switched back to Red Square
and the SNu house. SNu seemed
doomed to fall because of poor
financial management and cold
relations with the hill. SNu’s na-
tional chapter then stepped in to
save the day, as it were, with a
plan to raise $50,000 for the
house. As we will find out later,
SNu had a few more adventures
ahead of it. The month did end,
however, with the question of
who would fund Contact, the
school’s speaker symposium.
The I.F.C. eventually approved
an increase in funding for the
organization, which soon came
forward with a list a rather
mediocre speakers. One more
note: a Lexington police officer
was suspended in this month for
a 1977 theft at Hop-In...
November

As fall turned to winter, the
Phi became entangled in ques-
tions of aesthetics. The drama
department reacted nastily to
an editorial criticizing the
advertising of one of its plays. |

Un the more humorous side, tne
police car crash inquiry was
still at an impasse, with the
L.P.D. still after the student it
believed rolled the car into the
gates. And down in Red Square,
SNu suffered a_mystery of its
own when the house caught on
fire early one Saturday morn-

ing. The basement and the se- -

cond floor of the house were
damaged. By the middle of the
month, the Student Affairs
Committee had withdrawn
recognition of the W&L chapter
of the fraternity. The national
chapter (also located in Lex-
ington) at first indicated it
would assume the SNu debts,
but the ball was set in motion
for an abandonment of the W&L
chapter. Meanwhile; Contact
revealed its speaker line-up,
which featured the famous (F.
Lee Bailey) and the obscure
(Stewart Udall, Arthur Miller
(the lawyer, of course)). And
about this time, a national
magazine (Time) ran an article
on all-male colleges in the
United States. W&L was of
course mentioned, but in a way
that made the Lexington minks
appear hostile toward liberated
females and coeducation. The
article dredged up the issue of
coeducation — something that
had been dormant for some
time.
December

In another short month,
students were subjected to a
good bit of activity. Focus, nee
the Intellectual Symposium
(God knows what it was called
before that), came before the
E.C. with a plan to publish a 12-

 

page paper in the winter term.

Besides being merciful enough -

to rid us of the dreadful appela-
tion ‘Intellectual Symposium,”’
Focus provided a means of
creative thought for the campus
— something also promised by
the W&L Political Review. Both
organizations did appear during
the winter term, by the way.
Controversy continued over the
Time story, with one of the
students cited in the story say-
ing he was misquoted (Ed
Johnson, where are you?) and
another reader complaining
that the Phi’s editorial on the
topic was ‘‘spineless.’’ Hell hath
no fury like a wgman scorned or
a W&L man embarrassed. Also
in the month, an alumnus of the
Class of 1915, John Boatwright,
donated a cool $250,000 to the
university. The next month,
President Robert E.R. Huntley
would annouce that the school
had raised an extremely-cool
$67 million. Students soon settl-
ed in for the final weeks of the
term — worrying about exams
and growing restless for the
two-week break.
January

The winter term seems to =

bring out both the strange and
the macabre in Lexington.
Students looking forward to the
new term were shocked to hear
of the suicide of biology pro-
fessor Gary H. Dobbbs.
Students mourned the loss of a
man who seemed to epitomize
the successful professional. On
a wintry Thursday afternoon,
students gathered on the front
lawn of the Collonade to watch
President Huntley scatter

 

The Big Three, Hall Veueriein,
the SNU House.

Dobbs’ cremated remains.
Students could take some com-
fort to know that Fancy Dress
was on the way. The S.A.B. was
well aware of the fact, as it ap-
peared before the E.C. and
stated that the Diamond Jubilee
(75th anniversary of the ball’s
founding) would cost some-
where around $55,000. The 1981
ball had cost $38,000. The S.A.B.
also said it was working out a
plan with W&L Food Czar Jerry
Darrell for concert use of Evans
Dining Hall. The plan was in-
itiated with a reggae perfor-
mance. But January brought
more surprises. First, Betty
Miller announced she was retir-
ing from her post as secretary
of the dean of students. Then
came the worst storms of the
year. Snow banks and flu cases
piled up as students planned
ventures south in the upcoming
break. Despite the conditions,
organizations moved forward.
The S.A.B. continued its mam-
moth task of moving F.D. to the
gymnasium and the W&L
chapter of the Muscular
Dystrophy Association pre-
pared for its annual Super-
dance. Superdance ’82 ended up
being the most profitable one
ever, as Tripp Brower and his
crew netted somewhere in the
neighborhood of $24,000. Mean-
while, the I.F.C. began discus
sion of a delayed rush for next
year, with Dean of Fraternities
Dan Murphy asking a special
committee to examine the
feasibility of delaying rush for
an academic term. The E.C.
also departed from its ordinary
routine’ when Senior Law

‘ea

 

 
‘Representative Morgan Griffith
proposed that the committee
add two more members to its
11-man body. Discussion of this
matter was tabled for the next
month.

February
February opened with
perhaps the biggest story of the

year. President Huntley an-
nounced his resignation after 14
years at the helm of the univer-
sity. Saying that he had planned
to retire as far back as last fall,
Huntley made his announce-
ment a few weeks after he had
announced the completion of a
$67 million fund drive for the
university. Huntley’s resigna-
tion had been kept confidential
as far back as October. Super-
dance ’82 concluded with its
most successful haul ever and
the E.C. ended its talk of in-
creasing the committee’s
membership by. ‘“‘nuking’’ the
idea, to paraphrase a favorite
analogy of Eric Myers’.
February, if anything, was the:
month of Fancy Dress anxiety.
Students scrambled to get out
the F.D. “bid” and the S.A.B.
continued to promise the
greatest show ever. SNu popped
back into the news when a
general district court ruled that
that the SNu House Corporation
was liable for the local
chapter’s debts. The corpora-
tion seemed to think that it had
no responsibility for the action
of the W&L fraternity. The
university and chapter
members begged to differ,
however. SNu also claimed that
it had lost its financial records
in a Nov. 12 theft of the

treasurer’s apartment, thus
leaving the national organiza-
tion to handle the house’s $8500
worth of debts. Students were
given a break of sorts with the
Washington Holiday. Many
minks apparently opted for the

‘warmer climates of the south,

as indicated by the large ratio
of sun-tanned faces. Life also
became more complicated for
the S.A.B. when it was forced to
move the site of the Skip Castro
F.D. concert from the Warner
Center to Doremus Gym. Struc-
tural limitations were cited as
the main causes — thus raising
the possibility of a Brian
dePalma-like disaster had the
band played in the new gym.
F.D. was only a week away at
this time.
March

This is the month of the
university’s two staples— Fan-
cy Dress and lacrosse. The F.D.
jubilee was about everything it
was promised to be. Musical
entertainment varied from the
swing of Lester Lanin to the
funk of the Voltage Brothers to
the Rock of Skip Castro.
Decorations were nothing short
of stupendous, with each room
styled to commemorate a past
ball. The only problem was that
the bash ran the S.A.B. into a
financial sinkhole. Amidst the
F.D. hoopla was the release of a
New York. Times survey of
selected colleges. W&L was
given an ‘‘average”’ ranking for
academics, social life, and
quality of living. The survey
placed W&L on an academic
par with Sweet Briar and
Macon and left the university

miles behind U.Va. and U.N.C.
Political campaign rhetoric
also flared up when Bennett
Ross and Jim Averett vied for
the E.C. presidency.
Morgan Griffith ran unoppsed
for the vice-presidency and
Ross, running on a platform of
an E.C. that needs to be more in

tune with the student body, won:

the presidential election. Also
under the E.C. spectre was the
S.A.B., which spent the rest of
the month explaining its losses
at the ball. The losses were
calculated somewhere between
$15,000 and $20,000. Poor alumni
attendence was cited as one of
the factors for the loss. The
lacrosse team opened its
schedule with a thriller against

the Naval Academy and the .

promise of more to come with
matches slated against Virginia
and Carolina. And remember
that police suspension back in
October? By March, the affair
had mushroomed into the
suspension of more cops and the
allegations of a police theft ring
in Lexington. For students who
suspected the worst of the
L.P.D., it was the icing on the
cake. Meanwhile, things got
worse for the S.A.B. First, it
received a bad grilling from the
C. over the F.D. debts. Then a
rowdy crowd at a skin flick fore-
ed the eviction of the S.A.B.
from duPont auditorium and its
movie facilities. The S.A.B. was
out in the cold, literally. The
month did end on a positive note
for the S.A.B. when the E.C.
gave it the go-ahead for a Spr-
ing concert series that included

Nighthawks.
April

While half of April was
devoted to exams and Spring
break, the remaining part was
devoted to the casual at-
mosphere of the short term. The
lacrosse team had gone belly up
against Virginia, 22-8, but near-
ly beat the top-ranked Tar
Heels with an “Armadillo.”
W&L lost the game, 11-8, in a
match spoiled by hot tempers
and a post-game fight. Mean-
while, the I.F.C. was still kick-
ing around the delayed rush
question, this time raising the
topic at a Student Affairs Com-
mittee. A solution was promised
by the end of the month. From
Washington Hall came the word
that admissions applications
were at an all-time high
(perhaps a reflection of the con-
servative times). Seniors got
their first glimpse of the light at
the end of the tunnel at the
Senior Banquet. Rob Staugaitis
walked away. with the Gilliam
Award and Dr. Charles Turner,
a retiring history professory,
‘was the recipient of the Pusey
Award. As promised, the new
rush format was announced. To

the surprise of some, Rush was.

kept in the fall term and actual-
ly shortened by two weeks. The
earliest tearing opportunity
was pushed back two rush
dates, however, and newly-
elected I.F.C. President Mason
Ellerbe promised that fresh-
men would receive a more
thorough orientation. Critics
said the new format had the
same problems, but Ellerbe and

Dean Dan Murphy defended
their plan and asked for alter-
natives. Noticeably, there were
no takers to the challenge. The
E.C. slugged through its lame-
duck period by hearing subcom-
mittee reports. And quietly, the
Presidential Search Committee
was narrowing its list of can-
didates in preparation for next
month’s trustee meeting.
May

Thought by many to be the
most delightful month on cam-
pus, May offered unseasonably
warm temperatures and a
noticeable lack of precipitation.
Goshen and Twin Falls became
the new Meccas, the latter
becoming a bit too perilous
when its owner decided to en-
force his privacy rights. The
police theft ring culminated
with the indictment of 12 local
law enforcement agents.
Charges ranged from theft of a
pen to statutory burglary. While
the L.P.D. went through a
shakedown, the University
Council passed the new rush
format. And if students didn’t
have enough distractions, they
could have heard the speeches
of George Plimpton and Lloyd
Dobyns. The E.C. came to life
again, this time moving to com-
plete a Student Telephone
Union — one more way to avoid
the aggravation of CenTel. The
L.P.D. suffered another insult
when it wrote a letter of apology
to the Chi Psi fraternity for
wrongly shutting down a band.
Add to all this a flare-up bet-
ween the SPE’s and the FIJI’s
and you have a busy month.
Despite a 94 record, the
Generals were ranked only 13th
in the nation and missed the
playoffs again. And the admin-
stration adopted a plan
whereby a _ student could
theoretically graduate with a
better-than-4.0 g.p.a. The new
plus/minus system seemed to
have its own plusses and
minuses. In one last shindig, the
university celebrated its fund-
raising success by throwing an
extravagant affair for the top
donors. Included in the fun was
china imported specially from
D.C., red carpets and special
ceremonies and dedications.
The addition of new plaques on
academic halls gave one the im-
pression that W&L was becom-
ing the southern branch of
Cooperstown. Anyhow, the stu-
dent body rode out the remain-
ing part of the year.

In retrospect, 1981-82 was a
year of heights and depths. The
university continued to move
forward despite the occassional
setback. And despite the
pessimism of the times, the
school itself was in a rather op-
timistic position with a strong
endowment and increased ad-
missions. The past year has
seen trouble throughout the
world, but much of those ten-
sions have eluded Lexington. In
times of trouble, perhaps this is
the most comforting thought.

The Rugby Club reported that
it had a ‘‘disappointing”’
season, with an 0-4 record. The

. however, finishing the year
with a $54.00 surplus.

Bill Archer made the final
report for Focus. He stated that
the spring Excelsior was
cancelled due to lack of

Rush

(continued from page 1)
for freshmen which is over
before the first contact is made.
In this three-day period,
Ellerbe vows that, with brutal
honesty, every event the
freshman will encounter during
Rush will be frankly explained
from the realitites of the black
ball system to the working of a
bid night. However the fresh-
man fairs, these unique happen-
ings will arise regardless, and,
it is far better for him to expect

‘A second strength of the new
system is the placement of 2?

freshmen sign up for open
houses. These weekend days
will enable freshmen to visit
houses on their own and judge

having to rate the fraternities.

for open houses on heresay,
hometown reputations, or mere
guesswork, as they have had to
do in the past. Again, this addi-
tion will save precious hours for
the rushee in his short period
for decision.

A third forte of the adopted
calendar is the movement of
two rush dates to a Wednesday
night. In past systems all rush
dates beyond 1&2, when bids
are given, and 3&4, when bids
are accepted, have only been
licenses to show the ‘“‘unimpor-
tant’’ rushees the boiler room.
The placement of these two ex-
tra weeknight Rush Dates will
make them a crucial time for
meeting rushees while last-
minute decisions can still be
made.

It is obvious that the IFC, UC,
and SAC have given each of the
22 days of Rush careful scrutiny
and weight for opportunity.
Contact or no contact, rush is, in
reality, an intense hourly pro-
cess which can, if scheduled
poorly, drain the fraternity and
the rushee. Economy of time is
vital in planning a Rush calen-
dar. The adopted 1982 Rush
system is such an economic
calendar that frees all par-
ticipants in time for academic
pursuits while giving both
fraternity and rushee ample
time and opportunity to make a
reliable decision.

President Huntley Speaks To
‘Privileged’ Law Graduates

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity awarded juris doctor
degrees to 107 law students dur-
ing commencement exercises
for the W&L School of Law
Saturday.

Robert E.R. Huntley, presi-
dent of Washington and Lee,
was the principal speaker for
the ceremony, which was held
on the front lawn of the campus.

Huntley told the law students
that they are “privileged per-
sons,’’ adding that ‘‘privileged
means you have a larger
measure of control over your
destinies than do most. You
have better opportunities than
most. You have better
understanding of the world
around you and what has gone

before than most.
“You are also, because of
your privileged status,

obligated persons,’”’ he con-
tinued. ‘Especially as lawyers,
your obligations and your op-
portunities for service to others
and to our American experi-
ment will be great.”

Huntley said the graduates’
task is not, “as some would
have it, as brokers of power or

summer into a wall bearing the
names of persons who have
given the university a gift
valued at $1 million or more.
Although some might stop at
a figure such as $67 million, the
W&L Development Office has
not missed a step since the pro-
jects completion in January.
While Assistant Director
Sessoms has been executing the
final steps of the project
celebration, which has been no
simple task, Director of
Development Farris Hotchkiss
has not been sufficiently
satisfied. Hotchkiss has been
successful in raising an addi-
tional 2.1 million since the final
date of the project in January.
“We felt we wanted to make it
perfectly clear that as
marvelous as the $67 million
was, a University like ours con-
tinues to have needs,’’ com-
mented Hotchkiss, ‘“‘We’re very
happy that alumni and friends
have given us early support in
the post-project phase.” >
Sessoms continued, ‘‘the
future of an institution should
be to try to increase its level of
excellence. The brick and mor-
tar work is done,’’ said
Sessoms, “now we must con-
tinue to press forward.”
“A great fiction exists about a

“Power,” he continued, “‘is a

fact. But in a democracy, it is

school like W&L’’ said Hotch-
kiss. ‘‘We only charge 60 per-
cent of what it costs us to run
the school in the tuition. Forty
percent must come from some-
where else. Namely, gifts.”

So what lies in the immediate
future for a Development Office
after ten years of directed ef-

forts and $67 million? ‘‘We will

now begin to work on individual
needs,’’ says Hotchkiss.

This means priority on stu-
dent financial aid.

“Presently we are not able to
meet the needs of all the
students qualified for financial
aid,” Hotchkiss remarked. The
director of development cited a
figure that 33 students who were
qualified for financial aid in the
class of 1986 were not able to
receive the assistance they re-
quired. Initially the develop-
ment office’s goal was to offer
financial assistance to ll
students qualified but, says
Hotchkiss, that ceased to be a
reality three years ago. Cur-
rently approximately $1 million
in aid goes to 26 percent of the
student body.

All of the funding for student
aid at Washington and Lee
comes from gifts to the Univer-
sity. W&L is somewhat unique
in that aspect as many other

schools acquire sum*, _
from tuition. Washington and
Lee maintains a_ separate
budget for financial aid.

A substantial amount of this
budget will come from a $12
million estate donated to the
University by Stewart Pratt.
Pratt specified in his will that
the money from his estate be us-
ed only for financial aid and to
support faculty salaries.

“Even with that,’’ remarked
Hotchkiss, ‘‘we are still falling
behind.”

That is the reason for the new
emphasis on financial aid.

Asecond new direction for the
Development Office is in the
direction of increasing the
number of endowed professor-
ships in both the undergraduate
and law schools. With the addi-
tion of two recent professor-
ships, one-in the law school in
honor of President Huntley, the
total comes to seven endowea
positions.

While W&L men find con-
fidence in the phrase ‘“‘non in
cautus futuri’’ the university
itself can look ahead without
hesitation, stepping firmly on
the growing foundation provid-
ed by the guidance of the
development office and the
generosity of its alumni.

Crop Walk Successful

by B. Scott Tilley

On Saturday, May 8, the Crop
Hunger Walk, sponsored by
Washington and Lee and the
Lexington Presbyterian
Church, raised $2,300.00 for
World Hunger. In addition,
$630.00 was collected from the
‘University World Hunger Day.

Eighty-six walkers turned out
for the walkathon — about half
students from W&L and the
girls’ schools, and half citizens
of the town. The weather pro-
vided sprinkles early in the
morning, but cleared up later
on during the 12-mile walk. Aid-
ed by water stops along the
way, all of the walkers com-
pleted the course, which took
about 3% hours. Young children
as well as older adults par-
ticipated.

Seventy-five percent of the
proceeds from the walkathon
will go to CROP, a world wide
organization, and 25 percent ta
RARA, a local organization.
Proceeds from World Hunger
Day, which were raised through‘
a donated dining hall
meal by Gerry Darrell an
donation cans throughout
campus, will be split betwee
CROP, RARA, and TAAP
another local organization.

W&L Adds Two

Professorships

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has announced the
establishment of two endowed
professorships, including one
that will be named in honor of
‘W&L President Robert E.R.
Huntley.

In addition to the Robert E.R.
Huntley Professorship in Law,
Ballengee announced the
establishment of the Lillian and
Rupert Radford Professorship
in Mathematics.

The university said both posi-
tions are to be filled by the start
of the 1982-83 academic year.

The Huntley Professorship
was created to honor Huntley’s
presidency and his many con-
tributions to the university. In
establishing: the professorship,
the university’s board of
trustees designated
unrestricted endowment funds
which the university received
during the course of the

The Huntley Professorship
will be the first fully endowed
chair in the history of the
Washington and Lee School of

Huntley, who announced in
February that he will retire at
the end of 1982, previously
served as a professor of law and
as dean of the law school at
W&L before being named presi-

In announcing the creation of
the Huntley Professorship,
Ballengee said that the trustees
considered it ‘‘one small ex-
pression of appreciation for the
14 years of Mr. Huntley’s
presidency during which so
much has been accomplished in
so many important areas. The
board of trustees felt there
could be no more appropriate
honor for Bob Huntley.”

will begin their postgraduate
studies following their gradua-
tion in June of 1983.

Bond, a German and history
major, plans to study German
diplomacy from 1948 to the pre-
sent. He will pursue his studies
at one of three schools in West
Germany.

Corbeille, a history major,
will use his Rotary Fellowship

In his remarks, Fishwick
referred to Washington and
Lee’s long-standing commit-
ment to a liberal arts education.

“The main reason the (com-

of support is that it is not what
one might call simply a trade
school,’’ Fishwick said. ‘‘It is
built on the foundation that it
recognizes that beyond the

the liberal arts and who realize

Noting that about 25 percent
of the funds used to remodel the

“‘business has to recognize that
no institution survives without
public support and acceptance.
It has to do more than just make
a profit in order to meet the
public’s criteria. But it also
must realize that if it goes too
far and infringes upon the
legitimate concerns of govern-
ment, it also runs into great

” ue Ring-tum Phi, May 27, 1982

by G. Bruce Potter

If one had to sum up sports for 1981-82 here at General Lee’s col-
lege, the word ‘“‘almost’’ could be used. So could the word ‘“‘Ar-
madillo.’’ But that’s another story

The one theme that seemed to be prevalent throughout this year
with nearly every team, whether they were doing unexpectedly
well or just plodding along, would be that each came just short of
reaching its fullest potential.

Therefore, despite the good year for W&L sports (123-81-1 com-
bined record), that leaves room for improvement.

The usual skepticism once again greeted the football season back
in September, but once the leaves began to fall, the skeptics were
quickly put to rest.

Coach Gary Fallon’s squad gave a less-than-perfect performance
in the opening 20-7 loss to Gettysburg. Fallon used five different
quarterbacks before finally settling on Al Paradise, a sophomore
transfer from Harvard.

With Paradise under center, however, the Generals turned things
around quickly by winning their next two games, 24-17 over Emory
& Henry and 24-14 over Centre, before suffering a 13-10 setback at
Randolph-Macon. The team won its last six games to take the Old

Dominion Athletic Conference title and finish with an 8-2 record,
their best since the 1960’s.

Paradise threw for over 100 yeards a game, primarily to Mike
Fogarty, who hauled in 31 passes for 418 yards, despite appearing
in only seven contests, and Chris Cavalline. who caught 23 more.

Cavalline was also the Generals’ main threat over the ground.
The junior tailback rushed for 765 yards and seven touchdowns and
was named the best small college player i in the state of Virginia
and the O.D.A.C. player-of-the-year. "© ~*~

But, despite the outstanding record and the 0.D.A.C. champion-
ship, the W&L football season was missing one key ingredient — a
national championship bid. With one less loss, the squad almost
certainly would have joined the elite field of eight to compete for
the N.C.A.A. Division III title.

Meanwhile, the soccer team had hopes for a great season but,
after a good start, saw them go down with several key injuries and
numerous one-goal losses. The soccer Generals finished up their
season with a slightly disappointing 4-10-1 record for fourth place in
the O.D.A.C. There were some bright spots, however.

The Generals were ranked nationally for two weeks early in the
season and two players, sophomore Roiand Simon and junior Tad
Rener, were named to the all-O.D.A.C. team.

Under the direction of third-year coach Page Remillard,
however, the water polo team (more commonly known as
‘“‘mermen’’) had a truly amazing season, but they too fell just one
step short of the ultimate goal, the national playoffs.

The squad swept to a 31-5 record and the Southern League cham-
pionship (which includes such teams as Richmond, Virginia, and
Duke) and defeated several nationally-ranked teams.

But there was one team that gave the Generals troubles. It was,
of course, the Slippery Rock College of Pennsylvania. Washington
and Lee played Slippery Rock four times and lost four times.

And the last time came in the final round of the Eastern N.C.A.A.
water polo championships, thus relegating the Generals to a fifth-
place finish and knocking them out of any national championship
possibilities.

Junior transfer Eric Peterson and sophomore Rand McClain
were named to the all-American water polo team. Peterson set a
school record with 153 goals during the season.

A young Washington and Lee cross-country team placed fourth in
the O.D.A.C. meet, but rebounded to also finish fourth in the more
competitive N.C.A.A. Division III Regional Qualifying Meet in
Nashville, Tenn.

In that meet, W&L’s Angus McBryde placed eighth at 25:47.1 and
Frank Pittman was tenth with a time of 25:58.5. McBryde was also
the first Washington and Lee runner to receive all-conference
honors when he placed seventh in the 0.D.A.C. meet.

Certainly the one W&L team that came frustratingly close to the
N.C.A.A. playoffs was the basketball team. After compiling a 21-7
record and national ranking, they were apparently snubbed by the
N.C.A.A. selection committee and left out of the tourney.

The team got off to a slow start by losing its first three games, but
it was all uphill from there. Perhaps their biggest win of the season
was a 62-61 home decision over powerful Roanoke College. Senior
guard George Spears’ jumper with six seconds left provided the
winning margin.

After tying for the regular-season 0.D.A.C. title, the Generals
swept through the first two games of the conference tourney.
However, they fell to the feared Maroons by the count of 72-54 in the
championship game in Salem.

Sophomore John Lee Graves led the team in scoring (13.4), re-
bounding (7.4), and steals (34), edging out junior Brian Hanson in
‘those categories. Sophomore Billy. Yates hit on 56.7 of his shots
from the field and 86.2 percent from the foul line to pace the squad.

Another young team was the wrestling squad, with 11 freshmen.

And they got off to a slow start by losing six of their first eight
matches, but rebounded to win their final six contests and post a

  
The Ring-tum Phi, May 27, 1982, Page 7

fear Of The ‘Armadillo’

respectable 8-6 record.

Eight of the ten team members finished on the top four in their
weight classes. Sophomore Tim Valliere won the 158-pound class
and freshman Joe O’Neill captured first place in the 190-pound
class.

An 84 record is not shabby for such a young squad, and bigger
ro and better things are expected from them next year.

The Washington and Lee swimming team may not quite have met
the dominant theme of ‘‘almost.’’ The Generals had an excellent
season that was highlighted by a ninth-place finish in the N.C.A.A.
Swimming and Diving Championships held at W&L.

In that meet, senior Mike Bernot took second places in both the 50
and the 100-yeard freestyle events and the Generals’ 400-yard
freestyle relay team claimed fourth place. The squad posted a 6-5
regular season mark, but that can be chalked up to the schedule,
which included Richmond, William and Mary, V.M.I., and Virginia
Commonwealth University.

As the frozen,tundra of Lexington began to thaw, the active spr-
ing sports schedule got underway.

The golf team suffered yet another case of the ‘‘almosts’’ as to
}come within two strokes of winning the 0.D.A.C. title, but had to
settle for third place behind Roanoke and Lynchburg.

However, the Generals, paced by Titus Harris, Jim Kaplan and
Bill Alfano and coached by Buck Leslie, won all six of their duel
* matches to remain undefeated in that area over the past two years.

Meanwhile, another young Washington and Lee squad this year
was the tennis team with only one senior, Wes Yonge, in the star-
ting six.

Facing nearly all Division I and II competition, the team earned
.. a 6-17 regular season record and finished in third olace *~ *~
| 0.D.A.C. tournament held at W&L. In that meet, freshmen Andy
“Haring and Steven Bendheim each placed second in their single
flights and the doubles duo of Yonge and Jim Irwin also claimed the
runnerup position.

The baseball team got off to a very good start, but then became
mired in a slump about halfway through the season and never com-
@ | pletely rebounded, finishing the campaign with a 9-20 record.
However, they were in the O.D.A.C. playoff picture right down the
stretch, until a game between two other 0.D.A.C. foes was cancell-
ed, thus knocking the Generals out of post-season play.

Junior Chris Cavalline and senior Thad Ellis were named to the
second-team all-O.D.A.C. squad. Cavalline led the Generals in hit-
mee ting with a .340 average.

... On the mound, freshman Billy White paced the squad with a 3.09
ae earned run average in ten appearances. David Randall had an
ERA of 4.53 and a won-lost record of 3-3.

» Senior John McKee and sophomore Angus McBryde led the
© Washington and Lee track team to a 7-2 meet record and a third-
‘2 place finish in the O.D.A.C. championships held at W&L.

At that competition, McKee won the shot put event with a toss of
45 feet, 11-'4 inches. McBryde took the 1500-meter title with a time
of 4:02.48.

Once again, however, a case of the ‘‘almost” struck as the
; Generals placed third in the meet, only one point behind second-
«, place Bridgewater College, although well behind champion Lynch-
=e burg. 3
| And that leaves lacrosse.
| Which brings thoughts of close early-season contests, late-season

routs and, of course, the famed ‘‘Armadillo’’ slowdown offense us-
ed by the Generals in an 11-8 loss to the University of North
Carolina.

After an opening season 12-8 victory over Duke, the Generals
began their home campaign with a tough 11-10 overtime loss to
eventual N.C.A:A. playoff participant Navy. After crushing
Lafayette and easing by North Carolina State and Delaware, the
Generals once again were at home against Towson State.

Trailing late in the game, W&L rallied to tie the score and won,
(11-10), Hofstra (19-10), and U.M.B.C. (19-8).

A 15-10 triumph over William and Mary set the stage for THE
GAME with the University of Virginia. Except that it wasn’t much
of a game as the ’Hoos destroyed Washington and Lee by a final
count that required a calculator.

Not to be outdone, head coach Jack Emmer responded by install-
ing the “‘Armadillo’’ offense to avoid such a crushing from U.N.C.
the following Staurday. It worked well in that the Tar Heels could
not come up with a way to stop it, but W&L still went down in a close
defeat.

However, it was the 15-14 loss at Syracuse in the Carrierdome the
next week that all but eliminated the Generals from the playoff pic-
ture, despite impressive season-closing victories over Roanoke
(11-1), Hofstra (19-10). and U.M.B.C. (19-8).

And once again a W&L team had almost achieved a certain goal.
This time, that goal was the N.C.A.A. playoffs, but the selection
committee did not choose W&L to participate in that event.
However, with perhaps one or at the most two less losses (i.e. those
to Syracuse and Navy), this column might be about the Generals’
chances in the championship game.

Imagine the following situation...

A Hollywood actress, long renowned as beauty and sex symbol,
tragically dies before the completion of a movie she’s starring in
for M-G-M. She only had a few days of shooting left to go on the pro-
ject, and media speculation surrounds the fate of the film.

** Natalie Wood, 1981, right? Well, possibly. But a similar situation
presented itself nearly 45 years ago, and it is interesting to see how
the moguls of the film capitol dealt with each situation. It points to
an industry in which values seldom change.

In 1937, Jean Harlow was one of the hottest properties in the
business, having made a string of successful films for Metro since
signing an exclusive contract with them in 1931. Her credits includ-
ed the phenomenally popular ‘Red Dust’ (1932), ‘Dinner at
Eight’”’ (1933), “China Seas’ (1935) and a number of potent
moneymakers with Clark Gable, Wallace Beery, Spencer Tracy
and others.

During the spring of 1937 she was filming another story with
Gable, this called ‘‘Saratoga,’’ a racetrack romance featuring
Walter Pidgeon, Lionel Barrymore, Una Merkel and Hattie
McDaniel. The archtypical M-G-M production had about a week
left of Harlow scenes when the actress was suddenly taken ill. She

job and prints of the film were whisked to Loew’s Theatres across
the nation within’ weeks of Harlow’s death. “Saratoga” was a
definite hit, cashing in on a movie magazine-fed public dying of
curiosity. Apparently people amused themselves by trying to
distinguish between scenes with Harlow and the double, something
impossible not to do on the big screen.

Now it’s 1982, and M-G-M executives still haven’t decided what to
do about “Brainstorm,” a contemporary thriller that Natalie Wood
starred in with Cliff Robertson and Christopher Walken.

Its been months since Wood drowned off the coast of Catalina,
and given that the circumstances of her death were even more sen-
sationalized than Harlow’s, you can’t accuse the movie folks of
cashing in on the morbid curiosity of National Inquirer Readers.
They’ve hardly done a damn thing, and while you might say that
money isn’t their only objective in this case, there is an ingredient
quite different from Metro in the 1930s.

That is an insurance policy the studio signed with Lloyd’s of Lon-
don to the tune of 20 million dollars in case something happened to
“Brainstorm.” The film has been completed, with Wood’s two
scenes rewritten and shot to accomodate her absence. The ex-
ecutives now are waiting to see numerous special effects not includ-
ed in the film’s principle photography to determine whether to
release the project, or shelve it and collect on their policy.

 

‘Times may change, but profit motivation
does not, and the quality of most feature

films has taken a deep, deep plunge.”

died shortly thereafter, reportedly of uremic poisoning, and the na-
tion mourned the loss of the Blonde Bombshell.

Louis B. Mayer and other Metro executives speculated the fate of:
“Saratoga” before Harlow had even been put in the ground at
Forest Lawn. They knew they had a potential hit, drawing heavily
on the morbid curiosity of the public. But there was the problem of
several big scenes that required Harlow; they could not be written
to accomodate anyone else. So what to do?

Rewriting was done, and the brief scenes that included the
Harlow character were shot with a double. In these scenes she is
seen from the rear, usually wearing a hat, and with a few morsels
of dialogue spoken and dubbed by someone else. The scenes are
noticeably awkward, particularly in the clincher where Gable pro-
poses and the audience must settle for a close-up of his hand slipp-
ing the ring on the double’s finger and speaking his tag line in the
film (‘‘Honey, I love ya’’).

Overall, the film is pretty poor. Harlow is plump and dissipated-

zest and sassiness. This coupled with a shortened plot make it a
dissappointment, especially since it is a fine part for Gable. The
final scene is a cut from an earlier shot with Clark & Jean on a choo-
choo (with the print reversed so you know its going the other way)
singing a dreadful song called ‘“The Horse with the Dreamy Eyes.”’

Despite its obvious flaws, you can sit through the thing. M-G-M
probably didn’t even care about that — post-production was a rush

 

looking in most of her scenes and her lines are lacking incustomary —

Comparing the two situations you have: 1937, and a sure way to
make money is to nab a double and rush right ahead, regardless of
the outcome, release a truly mediocre film with an appropriate ad
campaign, sit back and watch the bucks roll in (Metro wasn’t the
highest-grossing studio from 1929-46 for nothing).

1982, and the economy is rough, movie business is down. Wood,
compared to Harlow, could be considered past her prime (‘‘Splen-
dor in the Grass”” was made when?), and the possibility of a ge-
nuine hit isn’t as great as a fat insurance payment, which would
mean a profit of a few million. At least they haven’t slapped
something together with a Natalie Wood ‘‘double’’ shot from
behind, but then people aren’t as dumb as they used to be, either,
and something like this would not escape the notice of the critics.

Money is still numero uno out there, which is why they’ve crank-
ed out really disgusting slaughter spectacles for a few years and
why the success of a lobotomized placebo like ‘“‘The Blue Lagoon”
is recycled into an even more inferior film called ‘‘Paradise.”’ In
the days of yore, a stinker was pushed cause they knew it’d make
money ; this is true now. But in the case of ‘‘Brainstorm,”’ by all ac-

counts a top-notch thriller, they’d rather hold it back in favor of
that sweet insurance.

Times may change, but profit motivation does not, and the quali-
ty of most feature films has taken a deep, deep plunge.

‘Ariel’
Combat

by R. Keith Hebert

As spring takes control 6ver
the seasonal cycle, many en-
joyable moments are added to
campus life. Only a handful of
students have missed their
chance to spend a day at
Goshen, and even fewer have
been excluded from the excite-
ment of a lacrosse game. Yet
one of these more relaxed
moments is reading the recent
edition of Ariel.

The Ariel offers a wide varie-
ty of artistic creativeness. The
writings are diverse as they
analyze an abundance of
themes ranging from a poem on
the hunting tactics of birds to a
short story on _ cruising
homosexuals. The magazine
also offers a collection of in-
novative photography that
should catch everyone’s eye.

A personal favorite is Mary
Dudley Allen’s ‘On Whether or
Not Birds Eat Dead Birds on the
Highway.’’ Allen demonstrates
her talent and imagination by
setting the reader in the mind of
a young bird, and through this
hunter’s consciousness she
poses questions about man and
his progress, Another poem,
“My Mother’s Red Lips”
displays Allen’s ability to
visualize ordinary happenings
in a complex fashion.

Joel Breckinredge’s ‘A
Measured Room’ also has
outstanding qualities. A young
girls’s reactions allow us to
reflect upon our childish at-
titudes from the not too distant
past. Breckinridge’s also incor-
porates Sara’s dreams and
emotions through the relation-
ship between Sara and her
grandmother. In a description
of Greta Garbo the author
cleverly states, ‘‘...Garbo’s face
was like a water mark on a
blank sheet of paper that let
Sara write in any emotion she
wanted.’”’ Joel should also be
noted for his bold contribution,
“Somber Reptiles.”

This Ariel contains a collec-
tion of literary excellence. Its
editors and contributing artists
should be congratulated and be
proud of their achievement.

Michael Caine Key

In ‘Deathtrap’

Deathtrap is a stylish screen
adaption of Ira Levin’s thriller
that still packs ’em in on Broad-
way after a comfortably long
run. It is good because it is
demanding of the audience’s at-
tention for all the right reasons.

Not entirely faithful to the
original, Deathtrap is full of
surprises and owes much of
what is right about it to the
director, Sidney Lumet, and
performances by Christopher
Reeve, Dyan Cannon and
Michael Caine.

It would be a crime to reveal

more than a wisp of the terribly
complicated plot, which con-
‘cerns the efforts of Caine. vlav-
ing a successful playwright on
the skids, to produce another hit
at any cost. He is desperate,
and since thrillers are his
specialty, it should come as no
surprise that murder fits in with
his plans of renewed success.
' Caine’s performance is the
centerpiece of Deathtrap. Mid-
dle age has softened his sharp
features and he actually looks
paunchy in some scenes. He has
subsequently said he _ pat-
terned his performance after
Sylvester the Cat, and he cer-
tainly sputters enough even
though he never exclaims “Suf-
ferin’ Succotash” or anything
like that. It is an uneven
nerformance, which could be
explained in terms of a wildly
fluctuating plot, but he ends up
coming across as silly as oppos-
ed to sinister, not unlike the
feline cartoon he says he sought
to emulate.’ This, I believe, is
supposed to fit in with the comic
aspects of the film, not all of
which come off terribly well.

Christopher Reeve is by far
the best in a great job of off-
casting. As an aspiring play-
wright with fewer scruples than
Caine, Reeve plays on his all-

American good-looks and the
image of politeness and civility
accrued through Superman to

pull off a truly riveting perfor-
mance. He is imminently more

watchable than Caine. The fact
that the two are homosexuals
might send some to the lobby,
but Reeve pulls it off successful-
ly by almost parodying the
Situation, and he speaks his
lines with more zest than
anyone else. He really makes
the movie.

Dyan Cannon got raves and
an Oscar nomination for her
performance in Heaven Can
Wait four years ago. She hasn’t
done much else since, and her
part here is that of another
screamer (which is funny in
about two scenes). The
character of her part is more
sympathetic, however, and she
comes off relatively unscathed.

Except for the opening scene
in a theatre and Manhattan bar,
most of the film is shot on a
huge set, as in the play, of
Caine’s home in the Hamptons,
a converted windmill. It’s a
great set, cleverly constructed,
not detracting from the goings-
on and never tiresome. After
the first half-hour it is irrele-
vant.

Lumet does a great job in
terms of pace, and the use of
camera is particularly effec-
tive. It must be said, however,
that the ending is a bummer
(and quite different from the
ending of the actual play). Irene

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

For Now, Adieu

Seeing as this is the last editorial of the year, I will
not prophesize on any topics. At this point in the year,
one doubts that students are concerned about
anything other than going home for the summer. In-
stead, I will say a few goodbyes and a few thank-yous.

 

 

 

First, thanks should go to all the people who helped
produce this year’s paper. Putting together a
newspaper on this level, especially with the pressures
of college, gives the Phi staff a uniqueness it should be
proud of. To Trent, John, Evans, Steve, and all the
rest, thanks. |

I have spent four years at this university and seen a
lot of people come and go. People are sometimes quite
vocal in their displeasure with this university, but I
really can’t think of a place where a student has such
opportunity. What I’m talking about is upward
mobility. In many organizations, a student can easily
move to the top of the ladder merely by doing his best.
This is not possible at a lot of other schools.

Before I leave, I would like to pass on my sincerest
wishes to my successor, Todd Smith. He will have the
opportunity next year to observe much of what hap-
pens on campus this year and help improve the quali-
ty of life at W&L. If he does as well as I suspect, the
Phi will be in good hands for another year.

Bill Whalen

P.S. Sorry about the Phi Awards, Carole. Maybe next
year.

Last Thursday night, the Interfraternity Council
made itself available for discussion of next year’s
rush schedule. The hour-long discussion was slick,
interesting, lively and unattended. Only 20 people
showed up for this event, which was advertised
around campus well before Thursday. Moreover,
the 20 people in the audience represented less than
half of the fraternities on campus.

What the rest of the student body missed was an
indication of what would happen next fall. The two
main spokesmen, IFC President Mason Ellerbe

and Dean of Fraternities Dan Murphy, defended
their plan while E.C. Representative John
Vlahoplus fielded questions and played devil’s ad-
vocate.

What Ellerbe and Dean Murphy defended was a
shorter rush — four weeks as opposed to the usual
six — and one which gives freshmen more of an
opportunity to look around before making any
decisions. The new system, according to Ellerbe,
offers the rushee a chance ‘‘to make an educated
decision.

Central to this plan is a three-day period of open
contact following rush orientation and registra-
tion. On Thursday, Sept. 9 (and all this is still sub-
ject to final modifications), registration and orien-
tation will be held. But from the beginning,
changes will be instituted.

The first such change will be a more thorough
orientation. Freshmen generally complain that
they are ill-prepared for rush — that they have no
idea of how to act at open houses, how to react to
not getting bids, etc. Orientation will deal more
thoroughly with this, Ellerbe argued. The IFC will
offer as many as six discussion groups at orienta-
tion to inform the freshmen of what to expect.

Following Thursday’s registration is three days
of open contact. This means weekend parties and,
hopefully, a chance for freshmen to meet the
houses on a more informal level. House-sponsored
parties will be held the next Wednesday (the 15th)
with the first rush dates beginning on Friday the
17th. Ellerbe said that he had considered begin-
ning the rush dates on the 15th, but opted for the
traditional Friday.

Rush dates 1.and 2 are on Friday, but rush dates
3 and 4 are on the following Wednesday. This was

the big surprise at the meeting. The IFC shortened
rush by placing half the dates on Wednesday

night.

The climax of rush is Friday the 24th when the
rushes can accept bids. This is actually a step
backward from last year, when rushees could tear
after only the fourth rush date. Rushees must wait
until after the sixth rush date before tearing this
time, however. Rush will officially end on the 30th,
with preference cards due. Within the period of
four weeks, the IFC believes it can educate
freshmen on the nature of rush, steer them to.the
houses, put them through eight rush dates and let
them make ‘‘an educated decision.’’ Whether this
will work is anyone’s guess.

Obviously we are operating without the benefit
of hindsight, but from watching Thursday night’s
presentation, it appears that the IFC is on the
right track to making a better rush. And here area
few reasons why:

1. The most important reason — the IFC
recognizes that there is a problem and has decided
to do something about it. Whether this new format
works is impossible to predict, but one has to be

|

impressed with the effort involved in solving the
problem. More thought has been given to the emo-
tional and social problems that freshmen have,
the pressures involved in making a decision withir

‘a few weeks, and the consequences of not getting a

bid. Efforts have been made in all these depart-

ments to help the rushers.

- 2. The IFC has not been one-sided in its
modifications. While the primary concern is for
the welfare of the freshmen, the IFC has also
made some improvements that should help the
houses. The most hoped for changes are the issu-
ing of noise ordinances. Ellerbe has formed a com-
mittee (headed by IFC vice-president Steve
Jones) to see if the amplified music curfew can be
moved back from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. Ellerbe also
has suggested a meeting between Lexington Chief
of Police James Kirby and fraternity presidents.
The eternal pessimist may label this as a pipe
dream, but again these are positive steps.

3. For once, the IFC appears ready for Rush.
Rush is something that is brought out of the closet
in late August and dusted off before the students
come back in September. Discussion and planning
for Rush this time occurred in April and May.
Careful administration, thoughtful planning, and
a more energetic IFC should alone improve next
year’s Rush.

But perhaps there is one final reason why rush
was limited to only four weeks. The panel simply
could not come up with a better alternative than
having rush in the first weeks of school. The ad-
ministration, as previously mentioned, favored
delaying rush until the beginning of the second
term. This would mean that most of the six-week
period between the beginning of the second term
and Washington’s holiday would be dominated by
Rush.

John Viahoplus had the final answer for not
delaying rush — money. If the fraternities could
survive fall term without freshmen dues, then
perhaps we would have a delayed Rush. Money
runs a university, it also runs a fraternity.

Delaying Rush for a few weeks was also
negated. Dean Murphy said that it would only in-
crease the anxiety of the freshmen. What it would
also do is push Rush into midterms — and cause
more friction on the hill. The best alternative,
then, was to hold rush in the first weeks of school.

It will be interesting to note how next fall’s
adventure turns out. In the past, much of the
responsibility for administering Rush has fallen
on the IFC and fraternity members. Next fall’s
system is a subtle change in-that it places more
responsibility on the freshmen. By giving rushees
more time to look around, fraternity members and
the IFC can take less blame for any confusion.

Unfortunatly, this may be asking too much of
the average 18-year-old freshman. Those
freshmen with associates from their high school
days in fraternities will probably do well in the
new system. They always have and they always
will. But those freshmen new to the W&L way of
life and without friends will again be on their own
to make the right decision.

It is said somewhere that college is the place to
begin making educated choices.

At W&L, the first of these decisions is made in
the first four weeks of school. One grows up fast at
W&L. .

Finishing Undefeated Season,
Golfers Snu

by B. Scott Tilley

Winning a tri-match against
Randolph-Macon College and
Bridgewater College, Coach
Buck Leslie’s golf team turned
in its second consecutive
undefeated season. As was the
case with basketball, the team
failed to receive an expected
NCAA Tournament bid, though.

Leslie noted that he was
“disappointed.” Usually a 77
stroke average is good enough
to get you in.” He noted that the
team finished second, third,
third, and second against Divi-
sion III opponents in the four
tournaments in which they com-
peted, and beat many other
Division I and II schools. He
also felt senior Titus Harris
should have been invited as an
individual, though he wasn’t.
“It’s our turn to get mad,” said

‘Partners’

(continued from page 9)

* door, cute but slightly tiresome,
and her relationship to the en-
ding is downright annoying.

Thrills, chills and excitement
abound. Deathtrap really keeps
you on the edge of your seat
without the benefit of blowsy
special effects or real out and
out violence (well, maybe just a
wee bit), In spite of its weak
ending it is highly recommend-
ed. >

Partners is another entry in
the latest spate of movies in-
volving the gay community,
and a pretty strange one at that.

Ryan O’Neal...well, let’s stop
a minute. What has he ever
done to afford him the distinc-
tion of being a great star? There
was Love Story, I suppose,
which relied more on the
schmaltz of the situation than
acting. What’s Up Doc? was a
good movie but he doesn’t
deserve any credit for that (he
came across as limp fish with
Streisand and Madeline Kahn).
And what else? Paper Moon,
but his daughter stole that right
away from him. Then there was
that all-star war epic A Bridge
Too Far, in which he was simp-
ly lost in the crowd; The Main
Event, no great shakes by
anyone’s standards, and then
two phenomenally bad flops,
Oliver’s Story and So Fine.
O’Neal appears to be strictly
celebrated for fathering Tatum

and screwing around with Far-
rah Fawcett.

Well, he doesn’t do himself
any good in this confused, poor-
ly made fiasco, either. The
“plot” concerns macho cop
O’Neal being paired with gay
bookkeeper John Hurt to set up
housekeeping in a gay neighbor-
hood to check into the murder of
a gay model. Most of the.
theoretical laughs are supposed
to come from O’Neal’s facial
expressions in reaction to
various situations. Certainly
they didn’t intend his haircut
and tight clothes for laughs, my
God, hasn’t he looked like that
in all his recent movies?

Hurt never registers as
anything but neuter on the sex-
ual scale. He is not overtly gay
except he likes to cook special
dishes for Ryan and do house-
work and all that. It is an empty
performance; Hurt’s face looks
blank most of the time. This
movie looks like it intended to
be a comedy-drama with em-
phasis on drama that shifted
midway to emphasis on comedy
which it falls far short on. Hurt
doesn’t act like he’s playing in a
comedy, his character is just
too sad and unfunny.

There are an abundance of
fag jokes and stereotypes which
tend to get old. Instead of focus-
ing on the relationship between
the two, which may have been

interesting (a couple of brief
moments indicate this may
have been possible), the dreary
story of searching for the killer
of gay models plods along in
such a manner as to make a
snack bar trip unavoidable.

There are numerous uncon-
vineing aspects to the movie,
notably the plush apartment the
“odd couple”’ live in. Do all gay
couples live in such luxury?
Also, Kenneth McMillan as the
police chief does it all wrong.
which can be blamed on the
dumb script, but its a shame
because he was excellent as the
slovenly firehouse chief in
Ragtime:

At the end (you’ll forgive me
for lessening the impact by
giving it away) it appears Hurt
has been mortally wound-
ed, and O’Neal delivers a trite
monologue over the body. It
sounds like it was written to be
spoken in a sobbing voice, but
Ryan rat-a-tat-tats right along,
and they take the body away
and later find out he’s alive, but
you never see him...it’s just
dumb; dumb, dumb, dumb.

I would say I hope O’Neal
finds a role suitable for his
talents, but perhaps he already
has. He’ll never be more than a
mediocre straight man, one of
those more famous for his off-
screen conquests than the quali-
ty of his work.
