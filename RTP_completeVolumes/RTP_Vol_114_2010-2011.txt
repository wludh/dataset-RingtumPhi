Helping
orphans ﬁnd
homes

Senior Elizabeth Gorman 3*
Summer in Ghana,

By Lizz Dye
STAFF w R ITER

While most Washington and Lee students spent
their summers slaving away in mundane internships
and nine-to-ﬁvejobs, senior Elizabeth Gorman spent
her summer working at orphanages in Ghana.

Gorman worked as a KaeMe Summer Intern.
KaeMe, which means “remember me” in Twi, is a
non-governmental organization whose mission is to
give every orphan and vulnerable child in Ghana a
loving and supportive family.

Although many NGOs in Africa have a similar
goal in mind, KaeMe realizes that the orphans in
Ghana face a unique situation. While other NGOs
focus on orphans who have lost parents to AIDs,
sixty percent ofthe orphans KaeMe serves have liv-
ing parents. _ -

Many of these children’s parents left them in the
hope that an orphanage education would ultimately
be better for their child. Despite these hopes, empiri-
cal research has shown that children have develop-
mental delays when placed in orphanages.

In order to address this problem, the Ghana De-
partment ofSocial Welfare has replaced many ill-run
children’s homes with a type of community center.
where families have access to food, clothing and ed-
ucation without giving up custody of their children.

Gorman worked at KaeMe as the organization

was first working in the ﬁeld, so she spent most of

heritime proﬁling children at the children’s homes.
She and her fellow interns worked with three recent
graduates of the social welfare program at the Uni-
versity of Ghana, Legon.

While the interns conducted an informal inter-
view, which consisted mainly of playing with the
younger children and asking about the likes, dislikes
and ambitions ofthe older children, the social work-
ers conducted formal interviews in the children’s na-

their past both at home and in orphanages.

Gorrnan’s group also scanned their existing ﬁles,
which ranged from a few scant pages to all-inclusive
proﬁles with family pictures, medical records and
school reports. <

The ultimate goal of KaeMe within the next fou
to ﬁve years is to ensure that each child has an ex-
tensive ﬁle in order to assess all ofthe children with
more accuracy.

With these nevi/gand improved ﬁles, the Depart-
ment of Social Welfare can work with adoption
agencies domestically and internationally more ef-

ﬁciently so that more children can be adopted or‘

placed with other family members.

Gorman said that she gained “a feeling of em-
powerment” from her experience. “Everyone can
make a difference ifthey put the effort in.”

New Volunteer Venture trip
explores healthcare in Ric/zmond

By Eleanor Kennedy
NEWS EDITOR

On August 30th, ten ﬁrst-years,
three sophomores and onejunior set
out for ﬁve days of service, learning
and bonding in Richmond as part of
the newest Volunteer Venture pre-
orientation program.

According to Volunteer Venture
coordinator senior Kara Karcher,

the Richmond trip focused on ‘‘ac- ‘

cess to healthcare in relation to pov-
erty.” Karcher said that Richmond is
known for its great healthcare sys-
tem, and it made particular sense to
create a trip with a medical focus in
light of the recent debates about na-
tional healthcare policy.

According to one of the Rich-
mond trip cooidinators, junior Shiri
Yadlin, the medical focus was a
major draw for incoming students.
“We had a lot of bio majors,” said
Yadlin. ‘

Students on the trip spent most
of their time visiting free clinics,
community centers and nonproﬁt
organizations that aim to provide
healthcare to the less fortunate, Yad-
lin said. Students helped out these
organizations by weeding, stufﬁng
sex-ed packets and cleaning out a
cluttered gym, a project which Yad-
lin said produced “a very dramatic
change.”

First-year Nicole Gunawansa
chose the Richmond trip because
she knew she wanted a service-re-
lated trip and she plans to pursue
medicine.

Gunawansa said one of her fa-
vorite visits was to the International
Children’s Hospital, where students
got to meet children of immigrants
from developing countries. She par-
ticularly remembered a seven year-
old who was about to undergo heart
surgery. She said it was “really neat"

to hear about the children’s experi-
ences ﬁrsthand.

Although Gunawansa and Yadlin
both said the trip was a success, they
admitted that there is room for im-
provement. Because the clinics the
students visited had limited work
available for non-medical profes-
sionals, many ofthe visits were more
observational than participatory.“We
couldn’t do as much hands-on as we
wanted,” said Gunawansa.

But Yadlin sees this lack of
hands-on volunteering as a challenge
that she is eager to meet. “That’s one
thing I’m hoping for next year... to
do more service work,” she said.

Although this was the Richmond
trip’s ﬁrst year, the coordinators are
conﬁdent that it will continue in the
future. “The Richmond trip lead-
ers laid the foundation for the trip
to continue in future years,” said
Karcher, “and next year we hope to
increase the number of students that
will be able to participate.”

Karcher, who went on a.,Volun-
teer Venture trip her ﬁrst year at
Washington and Lee, said she stayed
involved in the program because of
the great effect it had on her W&L
career. .

“I met and become friends with
my leaders and fellow participants,”
said Karcher, “but also found out
about programs like the Shepherd
Poverty and Bonnet Leader pro-
grams that I am still involved with
to this day.” '

Like Karcher, Yadlin says she
likes that the program provides ﬁrst-
years with an introduction the Shep-
herd Poverty program. “It was re-
ally cool for me to see the ﬁrst years
grasp the concepts of poverty,” Yad-
lin said.

Of course, Volunteer Venture is
also a great opportunity for incom-
ing ﬁrst-years to make new friends.
Gunawansa appreciated the intro-
duction to what the Shepherd pro-
gram teaches, but she also said that

\&

it was great to meet people with
similar interests. _

v“I made some really close
friends,” Gunawansa said. “It really
helped me coming in.”

Matarese said his experi-
ence was made even better by
the cultural exposure he enjoyed
through his host family.

He lived in a hostel whose
owner was also principal of the
school where he taught. The two
directors of education for the
program were also Ecuadorean
and were therefore more attuned
to the exact needs of the com-
munity.

The rural nature of Otavalo
impacts how students make it to
school. Houses are spread across
miles of farmland, so some stu-
dents must walk up and down
foothills and dirt roads for over

O-week: more than just parties

F rosh do community service around Rockbridge Co. in new orientation event

By Eleanor Kennedy
NEWS EDITOR

On September 9, while most
upperclassmen were tucked com-
fortably in their beds, recovering
from a little too much fun the
night before, Washington and
Lee’s newest students ventured
out into the community for a day
of service. ‘

Due to the timing of the
Jewish new year, Rosh Hasha-
nah, the ﬁrst day of classes was
pushed back from Thursday to
Friday. This change left a day
void of established Orientation
Week activities. A new activity
was created, one which would
expose ﬁrst-years to the needs

of the community they have just
entered.

According to junior resident
advisor Phil Jackson, 15 groups
of ﬁrst-year students spent three
hours Thursday morning doing
service everywhere from Lex-
ington to Buena Vista to Natural
Bridge. Jackson’s group painted
walls at a nursing home, while
some groups worked with Good-
will, Habitat for Humanity 0
Project Horizon. ‘

Although Jackson admitted
some students seemed unhappy
with the early morning hours,
he said that in the end “a lot of

people really enjoyed it.”

For ﬁrst-year Ashley Bishop,
the experience was “really cool.”
Her group worked at Habitat for
Humanity, painting and restock-
ing a library. Bishop said she
liked learning about Habitat for
Humanity programs as well as
having fun with her peers while
serving others.

Jackson said he saw the event
as valuable for W&L’s image. “It
is a good way to show that W&L-
students aren’t here just to party,”
he said.

Bishop said she liked the op-
portunity because it exposed her

and her peers to the world around
them. “A lot of people aren’t
from here so it really helped them
see what’s going on in the com-
munity,” said Bishop.

Can Weezer find true redemption in Hurley?

After a decade of selling out, Weezer is new album may be a step in the right direction

By Jonathan Salm
COLU M N IST

For the greater part of the
21st century, Weezer has been
utter shit.

Pardon my language, but
there is no better way to describe
a band with a self-titled debut
that redeﬁned power pop and a
follow-up record that has been
labeled the “comerstone of the
late-nineties emo movement.”

While l994’s Weezer and
l996’s Pinkerton will likely nev-
er be matched, die-hard Weezer
fans have been waiting for a re-
turn to form as intently as Cubs
fans have been praying for a
World Series ring.

With each post-Pinkerton al-
bum came disappointment and
frustration.

(a close-up of actor Jorge Gar- ,

cia, who portrayed the charac-
ter Hugo “Hurley” Reyes from
Lost), Weezer’s newest album is
anything but a gimmicky throw-
away. First track and lead single
“Memories” kicks off Hurley
with a pounding bass line, sing-
along choruses and lyrics that re-
call Weezer’s mid-90’s heyday:
“Pissing in plastic cups before
we went on stage/ Playing hack-
eysack back when Audioslave
was still Rage.”

“Ruling Me” and “Brave
New World” are two power pop
bamburners that are pure, vin-
tage Weezer.

“Unspoken,” Cuomo croons, “I
can feel those metal chains/ And
they’re holding back the hope
that keeps me sane/ I can ﬁght

explodes into an climactic, ca-
thartic rush of guitar and drums
that recall the conclusion of
“Only in Dreams” off Weezer’s
debut.

While there may be more
highlights on Hurley than on
Weezer’s last two (or three) ef-
forts combined, there do remain

tracks such as “Wliere’s my
Sex?” This track is so absurdly
stupid that it makes the album’s
cover look like avant-garde art.
Spoiler: It’s a track about socks
that replaces the word socks with
sex. Seriously.

Although the better tracks on
the album recall and possibly ri-
val early Weezer, Hurley lacks
the cohesiveness and consisten-
cy ofa truly great album.

There are numerous flops on
the album, including the closer
“Time Flies,” a bland folk song
with lyrics that could have been
penned by a 13 year-old.

certainly deteriorated over the
years, as well. Songs like “El

of collapsing porches, Traveller
incidents and multiple snowpo-
calypses, it is imperative that we,
as a community, stick together
and continue the efforts we start-
ed to pursue last fall term.

Let’s not beat around the
bush. We all have heard of the
alarmingly high sexual assault
statistics on campus. Begrudg-
ingly or‘ not, we have accepted
this as part of life at W&L. But
it shouldn’t end at acceptance.
With one of the biggest party
weeks behind us, we must stay
constantly vigilant in our efforts
to change these statistics in the
coming year. I know we hear
about sexual assault all the time,
but we can’t just sweep it under

a somewhat integral part of the
W&L experience. Many of us
like to let loose, throw back a few
brews and dance the night away.
It’s a nice break from all of the
work we put in as students at one
of the most prestigious schools
in the nation. At the same time,
we must know our limits and
maintain some sort of control.
Upperclassmen know much
more than the frosh do about lim-
its and our culture here. There-
fore, while we all like to lose a
bit of control, we must keep an
eye out for potentially danger-
ous situations. If we notice a girl
or guy stumbling around, obvi-
ously a little too intoxicated, we
can spare a few moments to ask

about her or his well-being. You
could be their hero of the night—
who knows if there’s a creeper
trying to grind up on them on

the dance ﬂoor? (Speaking from V

experience, that’s a situation best
avoided.) Or, ifyou notice some-
one with whom you aren’t par-
ticularly friends hunched over
a toilet alone, would it take too
much out of you to get them back
to the Health Center? It is a safe
haven, and you don’t have to
spend the whole night watching
over someone.

These suggestions aren’t
meant to chide anyone into be-
ing a good Samaritan or to com-
promise the party experience,
but they are small steps toward
preventing statistics. If some-
one steps in before the frosh
girl blacks out, perhaps we can
prevent an incident of sexual as-
sault. If someone takes the boy
who’s projectile vomiting to the
health center, perhaps a preda-
tor’s plans could be foiled. Do
you see where I’m going with
this?

So, go forth and be merry. V

Party hard, but not too hard. Take
into consideration that you were
once a freshman, and some mis-
takes that you made could have

been prevented if only a guid-
ing hand had pointed you in the
right direction. Some mistakes
are funny stories, but other mis-
takes can signiﬁcantly impact a
person’s life in a negative way.
We are a small school: what goes
around comes around. Instead
of spreading mono, let’s spread
concern for one another’s well
being.

Hurley clearly has its short-

Hurley will never match mid-

First Year advice that wasn’t quite covered during O-Week

Stockton Bullitt outlines the true do 3 and don ’ts for the first year spent as an undergrad at Washington and Lee

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

Now that we’re all a year
older, we’re going to have to get
used to the fact that we’re all
now in new grades.

Seniors, you have to start
coming to terms with the fact
that you have nine months until
your lives come down to 40lKs
and youth soccer games.

Juniors, you have to start
coming to terms with the older
version of bar mitzvah season:
21st birthdays.

And sophomores, you have
to start coming to terms with be-
ing irrelevant because you matter
about as much as Sasha Gray’s
acting career. I

Freshmen—oh sorry, ﬁrst-
years—you have quite a bit of
issues with which you need to
come to terms.

You’re in college now. It’s not
just any college, but a college
with a dead president in its back-
yard. Surviving this year will be
,an adventure, but it will be made
much easier if you follow a cou-
ple of guidelines.

Older people, you can feel
free to disagree with my advice
to the new kids, but freshmen,
trust me: I’m right.

So, without further ado, here’s

some advice for passing freshmen .

year at Washington and Lee.
1. You are the Master of the
Universe

See, you spent your last four
years in high school falsely as-
suming that you were at the cen-
ter of the universe. Luckily, now
that you have entered your fresh-
men year here, you’re actually
right.

All the other grades are go-
ing to court you, kiss your ass
and ﬁght for your attention in the
upcoming weeks. You are to the
Washington and Lee social scene
what Silly Bandz are to eight
year—olds.

2. Embrace being the center of
attention

Live up your freshmen fall as
best you can. Every day that you
don’t embrace your inner joie de
vivre is one more day that you
will regret later in your college
career.

This is the time to go on ad-
ventures. This is the year to
leave Windfall long after the sun
comes up. This is the year to go
camping deep in the woods for
days at a time. This is the year
to live out Vince’s current season
on “Entourage.”

You won’t have time to cel-
ebrate your college freedom the
older you get, and worse, you
won’t have three years of people
following your every move af-
ter this year. And in case you’re
wondering what your uniform
should be for these celebrations,
remember that when he was I8,
Jesus wore knee-high socks, a
lax penny and a backwards hat
from the town where he had a
summer house.

So regardless of who you
are and regardless of the extent
to which you do it, suck all the
air you can out of the whipped
cream can of freshmen year. That
being said...

3. Remember that you know
nothing

You heard me. My favorite
part of O-Week this year was sit-
ting back and listening to fresh-
men tell me what college is re-
ally like. .

Oh, you watched “Greek,” so
obviously you know what life
here is like. Gotcha. Nobody
likes a younger know-it-all, so
learn to shut your mouth.

I don’t care if a senior is tell-
ing you that Kevin Kolb is a le-'
gitimate NFL quarterback or that
Ron Paul will be president one
day; it’s not worth arguing about
it.

4. Assimilate into the culture
a little

I’m not saying that you need
to start calling it the War of
Northern Aggression but put a
little effort into ﬁnding ways to
identify with your surroundings.

Get a deﬁnitive opinion on
whether you are a Salemo’s or a
Frank’s person. Start listening to
some frat music: ifyou like good
music try listening to Chiddy
Bang, and if you like bad music
try listening to Sam Adams‘.

By no means does this mean
that you _ need to change your
personality, but now that you’re

you from the Walmart shelves.

populated with creatures in blue

5. Appease the shareholders

Even though they have shifted
from domestic tyrants to ﬁnan-

still need a little bit of love.

Give them a call occasionally,
especially when you’re running
low on funds. Think of yourself
as a politician and them as cam-

You will probably need at

may not be all they seem, and
heartbreak warfare is not really
fun to go through during rush.

The only real exception to this
is if you are Paul Rudd from “I
Love You, Man.” And even then
you’ll be forced to spend your
evenings watching “Chocolat.”

10. Spend this year taking in-
troductory classes

I know parents are going to
kill me for this one, but this is
really not the time to be taking
super-interesting, yet incredibly
demanding classes.

If you spent your high school
career killing yourself to get into
this college, which I’m assuming
most of you did, then you might
be a little bumt-out on academ-
ics.

Make this year about tak-
ing classes you need to take and
maybe trying a few new kinds
of classes. Save the fascinating
classes for a time when you are
once again fascinated by classes.

Now, if you spent your aca-

demic career chained down by
the intellectual incompetence of
your former peers and are dying
to ﬁnally spread your academic
wings, then completely disregard
this section, but when you have
to bite your tongue to stay awake
at your 8 a.m. 300-level class,
don’t say I didn’t warn you.

Oh, and guys, it might be
a good idea to go easy on your
classes for the winter semester.
Just, um, a hint.

11. Never anger the Co-op

ladies

Purveyors of both wisdom and

sunrises, the Co-op ladies, along

with the crew in D-Hall,,hold the ‘

key to your stomach. Don’t mess
with them.

I have seen many overly ag— I

gressive students badger the la-
dies around midnight when free
food is occasionally given away

(this used to be a secret until se- "

crets stopped being possible at
W&L around 1789), and ‘their
lives have gone progressively
downhill.

Maybe it’s a buffalo bite or
two being taken away, maybe
it’s an extra 50 cents added onto
the cash tax, or maybe they will
just call another name when your
food is ready.

Regardless, these Venuses of
the commons are to be treated
with respect and admiration-
and who knows, maybe a sunrise
sandwich will ﬁnd its way into
your welcoming hands.

12. Listen to this article

This is one of the only places
you’ll hear sagely advice, like
that partying under the County
Seat porch is never a good idea.

_ Other little tidbits to note
are to avoid College ACB only
if you live on the fourth ﬂoor of
Graham-Lees and to make sure

you’re near a bathroom 10-15

minutes after eating at D-Hall.
You’ll thank me in due time.

Oh, and one last thing, to that
kid from Arizona who won the
trivia game at the beginning of
O-Week: don’t use it to try and
get laid. It doesn’t work. I know
from experience. Use this article
instead.

COLUMNIST

For those of you with good
memories, think back to the
ﬁrst time in your life when you
said something negative about
someone else.

One of your parents prob-
ably stepped in, chiding you to
“put yourself in the other per-
son’s shoes” before you rush to
judgment.

In this (Marlboro) light,
we’re going to take a look at
life through the eyes of one of
the country’s most persecuted

‘ minority groups: that of the
American smoker.

A hundred years ago, many
Americans disapproved of the
lifestyle of Irish immigrants.
Restaurants banned the Irish
with their unwelcoming “No
Irish Need Apply” signs, and
even the American government
supported harsh restrictions
aimed at controlling the Irish.

Substitute “smokers” for
“Irish” in the previous para-
graph, and it is obvious that we
have a minority group in need
of some love on our hands.
To quote the great bard Snoop
Dogg, “let’s take a journey” into
the life of the average American
smoker. You might think this is
just a “puff” piece, but hope-
fully it will give you something
to enjoy and read during class
as your ECON 101 professor
teaches you about inelastic de-
mand (assuming you’re laid-
back enough to appreciate the
irony).

Every day, you, the Washing-
ton and Lee smoker, feel alone,

unwanted, neglected. Your “real
friends” refuse to accompany
you as you shiver outside, alone
in the cold. Whenever you ap-
proach attractive women (or
even unattractive women for
that matter), they recoil in hor-
ror, as if you were brandishing
a burning stick on ﬁre or some-
thing. Elitist professors snort at
the habits you apparently share
with the Neanderthals, conde-
scendingly musing, “How hoi
polloi.” Even airline pilots taunt
you in your misery, leaving the
“No Smoking Sign” that lies
above your head fully lit right

once a week,” you feel unappre-
ciated. After all, if more Ameri-
cans were like you, there would
be no Social Security crisis.
Heck, there would be no Medi-
care crisis, and we’d probably
have a balanced budget.

Come on, you voluntarily
buy an item taxed at 300 percent
(every week no less) and this is
the thanks you get‘?

Even though what you’re do-
ing is perfectly legal, you’re re-
garded as an outcast. Your uncle,
Philip Morris, is such a pariah
that he is not even legally al-
lowed on television anymore. A

Come on, you voluntarily buy an item taxed at

3 00 percent (every week no less) and this is the

thanks you get?

next to the “Seatbelt Required”
sign, as if there is the slightest
chance that American Airlines
will let you light up midﬂight if
you play your cards right.

Worse, when you ﬁip through
the dozens of pages that denote
the minority groups protected
under your company’s “Equal
Opportunity Employer” code of
conduct, you notice that smok-
ers are conspicuously absent
from the list. After all, this is the
twenty-ﬁrst century. And you,
sir, are a social albatross.

Like a parents paying thou-
sands of dollars to send their son
to college who “only calls home

free market, indeed. A double
standard, you insist.

The FDA doesn’t mind giv-
ing pharmaceutical companies
TV time to air those drug com-
mercials that end with the mo-
notonous voice warning that
“side effects may include AIDS,
pregnancy or death (among oth-
er things)”, but heaven forbid we
ever see a gentleman churning a
Churchill. Oh well, life goes on
(err, maybe).

You wryly smirk when you
enter a bar or restaurant that
the (*cough*) liberals haven’t
slapped with a No-Smoking ban
yet. You rub your hands_ with

glee when you see that the bar
is divided into “Smoking” and
“Non-Smoking” sections, which
is kind oflike a pool roping itself
off into “Peeing” and “N0n-Pee-
ing” sections.

Instead of spending your night
chasing women, you choose to
sit next to the most obnoxious
person you can ﬁnd. It’s time to
“kill” two birds with one stone,
so to speak. You casually light
up your cigarette and take a nice,
slow puff, knowing full well that
your persecuted lifestyle choice,
much like Ted Kennedy’s driv-
ing, could potentially lead to the
death of those around you.

While everyone you meet
wishes that you would quit smok-
ing, you wish that you could go
back to a simpler time. I

A simpler time like the 1920s:
the good old days when smoking
was healthy. Back when it mat-
tered what brand four out of ﬁve
doctors endorsed (of course, even
back then, you had to watch out
for the “hatemongers” who went
as far as to argue that America’s
sweet ﬁery sensation “caused
cancer,” but I digress).

Obama must have made a
thousand» promises on the cam-
paign trail, but “quitting smok-
ing” is the only one he seems
to have kept, you note with a
twitch. For the third time in two
years, the Democrats are raising
taxes on cigarettes “to discour-
age consumption,” they claim.
On that note, you take a drag as
you‘ ponder what the purpose of
the “income tax” is.

! Locavo res feast

in Staunton r

Local food trend succeeds in surrounding areas and grows in popularity on W&L campus

By Marie.Locke
STAFF WRITER

The recent Locavore Fest,
held in Staunton, VA, celebrated
the use of locally grown foods.
The festival, which was hosted
by the Transition Organization,
was held on September 4.

The event featured a talk by
Joel Salatin of Polyface Farms,
“a family-owned, multi—gen-
erational, pasture-based, beyond
organic, local-market farm and
informational outreach in Vir-
ginia’s Shenandoah Valley,” ac-
cording to the farm’s website.

Several Staunton restaurants,
including Zydore, Staunton Gro-
cery and Mockingbird Artisan
Fare and Grill featured locavore
menus in honor of the event.

The evening highlighted a
growing trend towards the use
of local food in homes, restau-
rants, and here at Washington
and Lee. According to Assistant
Manager of the Marketplace
Kelly Brown, the push to use
local food on campus started
two years ago but has recently

Soco serenades frosh

gained momentum.

“We use a lot more [local]
product than we did in the begin-
ning,” Brown said. i

The initiative to cook with
local food came largely from
President Ruscio and several
student committees, accord-
ing to Brown. Currently, W&L
spends more than 12 percent of
its budget on products from over
50 local farms. W&L has also_
been awarded by the College
Sustainability Report Card with
an “A” grade for its food and re-
cycling program.

Special Projects Coordinator
Chris Carpenter has helped in
the quest for local food.

“Carpenter works with local
producers and inspects any new
vendors [dining services] uses,”
said Marketplace Chef Geral-
dine McCutcheon.

According to McCutcheon,
Carpenter is an experienced chef
and who is able to ﬁnd qual-
ity products while keeping cost

limitations in mind. He ensures
that the eggs are cage-free and
that the meat and dairy are free
of hormones and antibiotics.
The Marketplace menu is a

buys items that are already pur-
chased from another source.
Also, several of the products are
seasonal, like the local tomatoes
currently found in many reci-

blend of source- and menu-driv-
en lo.cal items. When Carpenter
ﬁnds new companies, he works
with Ms. McCutcheon to see if
she can develop a way to use the
product in Marketplace menus.

F irst-years get a taste of W&L tradition and culture

By Holly Suthers
ARTS & LIFE EDITOR

Orientation Week, affec-
tionately known to most as “O-
Week,” is a time where new stu-
dents are introduced to timeless
Washington and Lee traditions.
One of the most notable‘ and
loved events of all is the a Capel-
la concert at the Alumni Picnic at
the Liberty Hall Ruins.

This past Sunday evening,
choral groups JubiLee and
Southern Comfort provided an
entertaining and memorable ex-
perience for new and returning
students alike.

“I always enjoy the a capella
concerts. The songs are great and
the voices of all of the singers
are amazing,” said senior Mag-
gie Dozier.

W&L has four a capella
groups on campus: JubiLee,
Southern Comfort, General
Admission and Washingtones.

While the last two groups did not
perform at the picnic, they will
have several events throughout
the year.

Each group has unique char-
acteristics, but their high caliber
of performance is equal across
the board.

JubiLee, the all-girls group,
‘sang “Higher” with a solo by
senior Sarah Vinegar and “Ain’t
Too Proud to Beg,” with a solo
by junior Kaelin Fraley. JubiLee
is led by Emma Redd and held
auditions for new members this
past Sunday.

The infamous men’s group
Southern Comfort, or SoCo,
performed a rousing rendition
of “Kiss the Girl,” in which the
men invited two freshmen to par-
ticipate and even kiss. The group
also held auditions this past Sun-
day and is led by senior Clark

Simcoe.

“SoCo has been one of the
most memorable experiences for
me at W&L,” said senior Graham
Perkins. “I will always remember
Malcolm Hines and Thomas Sell-
ers’ entertaining faces and voices
during every performance.”

A capella performances take
place several times throughout
the year. The most popular events
are held on Parents Weekend and
during the holiday season. Ticket
information is available from the
Box Ofﬁce at the Lenfest Center
and remember to reserve tickets
in advance.

pes. Carpenter and McCutcheon
work closely together to ensure
that the products are of the high-
est quality. The Chef also re-
quests for Carpenter to ﬁnd spe-
ciﬁc products that she has seen
at the local markets in the area.
Students and faculty eating at
the Marketplace should look for
the many locally sourced menu

items, which are often fresher
and healthier than other prod-
ucts. Lexington farmer Charlie
Potter supplies all the burgers
and ground beef in the Market-
place. The chicken is local from
Sunrise Farms, and producer
Steve Baker supplies breakfast
sausage.

The Marketplace also fea-

tures cheeses and yogurts from’

Mountain View Farms, one
of the most popular being the
“Moogurt.” The honey is bought
from Whistle Creek Apiary, and
grits and whole-wheat ﬂour come
from Wade’s Mill. Even the tofu
is made locally by Twin Oaks,
which uses soybeans grown in
Virginia.

One ofthe most popular items
is milk supplied by Homestead
Dairy, located in Burt Chimney.
This milk is fresh, additive free
and has more solids in it than
the commercially produced milk
found in grocery stores.

W&L has plans to expand

its reliance on local products. In
part, the focus is on responding
to the changing tastes of each
class and expanding the array of
healthy Options. For example,
pizza is now made with a whole-
wheat crust and whole-grain-
pastas and brown rice have been
added to the menu. Other addi-
tions include sweet potato fries,
a variety of breakfast choices
and baked goods.

 

Lyrics every W&L student should know....
The Washington and Lee Swing

Come cheer for Washington and Lee,

We're going to win another victory!

The White and Blue we will ever wave in triumph
For the University. RAH! RAH! RAH!

Fight to the ﬁnish we are with you,

Break through the line on every play;

Rush the ball on down the ﬁeld
And we will win thisgame today.

When Washington and Lee's men fall in line,
We're going to win again another time;

For W&L I yell, I yell, I yell,
And for the University, I yell, like hell!

And we will ﬁght! ﬁght! ﬁght! for every yard;
Circle the ends and hit that line right hard!
And we will roll those Wahoos on the sod!
Yes, by God! RAH! RAH! RAH!

HEY!

its season opener in a 3-0 loss. The Gen-
erals, picked to be No. 2 in the ODAC
conference in a preseason vote by league
coaches, managed to hold off the Cardi-
nals for the ﬁrst half but three second-

games under their belt and they’re a very
athletic team, so I think it was a good
learning experience for everyone to take
us forward into the next couple games.”

Senior midﬁelder Tory Gagliardi

 

scored the ﬁrst goal for Catholic on an
unassisted toss. Junior forward Tracey
Scanlon brought the Cardinals’ lead
to 2-0 with another netter. Senior mid-
ﬁelder Caroline Reilly struck the W&L
goal again for the Cardinals with a shot
off a penalty corner and an assist from
defender Catherine Mirsky. The Gener-
als, meanwhile, struggled to get their of-
fense offthe ground.‘ ’ .

“I think our passing and receiving
could have been better... just looking as
a team up the ﬁeld to get some offense
going,” said junior offensive player
Christina Benedetti. “We had no offense
whatsoevef....The good part about it is
all ofthat is so ﬁxable. We can do drills
to work on passing and receiving. We
can do things to work on defense.”

The opening loss comes on the heels
of a largely successful 2009 season. The
Generals closed out the year with a loss
in the ODAC semifinals to‘ Eastern Men-
nonite University. The team ﬁnished l0-
7 overall and 5-2 in the ODAC confer-
ence.

The Generals lost their leading scorer
Sallie Armstrong, who graduated, and
her absence will be felt on the offensive
side ofthe ﬁeld, saidjunior forward Em-
ily Kunkel.

“She deﬁnitely had the momentum

that we could have used in the game,”
she said. “But we bumped Kelly Tran
[senior] up to forward and that really
helped us a lot.”

The team returns several other key
players, including sophomore forward
Katharine Price who notched ﬁve goals

last season, and team captains Emmy
Mathews and Kate Donnelly.

The Generals’ next game is set for
Tuesday at Frostburg State University.
Game time is at 6 p.m.

Volleyball takes first in W&L Invite

The Generals went 3 -I over the weekend and dropped only three sets to claim victory in their opening tournament

By Rosie Purdy
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee volleyball
team had a triumphant beginning to its
2010 season this weekend, defeating
three out of four teams to win the W&L
Invitational for the seventh time.

Senior defensive specialist and cap-
tain Summer Goldberg said she is proud
of the team’s early victory.

“One of our biggest goals from pre-
season was to win a tournament,” said
Goldberg. “So it was really nice to ac-
complish that so early in the season.”

. The Generals success in the tourna-
ment began with a 3-0 sweep against
McDaniel College.

First-year outside hitter M.A. Boles
and junior middle hitter Lindsey Dee
aided in the win, totaling 14 kills and six
digs, and nine kills and eight blocks, re-
spectively. Senior middle blocker Lou-

ise Brooks also contributed, with ﬁve
kills, ﬁve blocks and four digs.

F irst-year setter Meghan Meleski
totaled 22 assists and four service aces,
while sophomore libero Cameron Hill
chipped in 17 digs.

W&L struggled in its next match-
up, falling 3-2 to Averett University.
After battling Averett through four sets
and forcing the game into a ﬁfth set, the
Generals were ultimately defeated 15-9
in the ﬁnal set.

Leading the Generals’ offense for the
match was junior outside hitter Megan
Daily, who added 17 kills, while Boles
contributed 16 kills.

Meleski helped the Generals rally
with 35 assists and 13 digs. Hill totaled
20 digs, and Goldberg added 10 digs and
three service aces.

Goldberg said that unforced errors
were a big part of the team’s loss, but
she wasn’t completely disappointed in
the outcome.

“We made a lot of mistakes that al-
lowed [Averett] to rack up a ton of
points,” Goldberg said. “But the game
showed that we could battle back, even
when we were down. We weren’t just
going to give up.”

The team rebounded from Friday’s
loss with a 3-0 victory over Southern
Virginia University on Saturday mom-
ing. W&L won an easy ﬁrst ‘set with
a score of 25-10. Tensions were high
during the second set of the match, as
the SVU Knights stole the lead several
times, but the Generals held them off
and triumphed 35-33. A 25-10 beating
in the third set secured W&L the win.

Highlights of the match included
nine digs apiece for Dec and Boles, six
kills from Daily and four kills each from
sophomore right side Bailey Walker and
ﬁrst-year outside hitter Allison Rouse.

The invitational wrapped up with a
3-0 sweep for W&L against Transylva-
nia University in the ﬁnal and touma-
ment-deciding match. Boles led the of-
fense with ll kills, ﬁve digs and three
service aces. Hill added 16 digs, while
senior defensive specialist Jenna Finger
chipped in eight digs and three "service
aces.

With a three-way record tie between
W&L, Transylvania and Averett, the
win went to the Generals, who lost only
three sets throughout the tournament,
compared to Transylvania’s four and
Averett’s ﬁve.

Boles’ weekend record of 50 kills, 40
digs, and 13 service aces earned her the
title of tournament MVP. She was also
named to the invitational’s All-Touma-
ment team, along with Dee and Meles-
ki.

Senior defensive specialist Marah
Schmitz said the ﬁrst-year players such
as Boles will play a big part in the team’s
success this season.

“It doesn’t usually happen that
so many.of our freshmen are on the
court with so much playing time,” said
Schmitz. “We have a very strong group
of freshmen this season.”

The Generals will ﬁght for another
win when they play Guilford on Tues-
day night.

Women’s soccer breaks even in invite

The Generals dropped their ﬁrst game, 1-0, to Sewanee, but defeated Methodist University, 1-0, to start season I -I

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

Back-to-back home games for this
weekend’s Washington and Lee Invi-
tational gave the women’s soccer team
a 1-1 start to the season. The Generals
stumbled to a 1-0 loss versus Sewanee
on Saturday, but rebounded with a 1-0

win over Methodist University on Sun-
day.

It’s “kind of a mixed reaction,” said
senior midﬁelder Taylor Garrett. “The

team played really well. There were a lot
of positive things coming out ofit. .. but
at the same time we had a lot oftrouble
putting the ball in the back ofthe net.”
Facing off against Sewanee, the Gen-
erals were able to hold off the Tigers for

much of the game. But Sewanee defend-
er Lilly Barnett used an assist from mid-
ﬁelder Bess Goodman to break the 0-0
tie and earn the win for the University

of the South.

The loss marked a sluggish start for
the Generals, who last year claimed the
ODAC Conference Championship and
earned a bid to the NCAA Division III

women’s soccer tournament. A second- .

Saturday’s game

The Generals are hoping for similar re-
sults this year.

“Going into every season our goal
is to win ODACS [and] make it into the
NCAAS, and so that’s what we’re look-
ing toward,” Garrett said. “We started
with a loss which is unfortunate, but
we’re looking to keep winning...We’re
expecting to do really well this year.”

A late-game goal from Garrett put the
Generals right back in winning form in
their second weekend match-up against
Methodist University.

Scoring the ﬁrst team goal of the sea-
son “was really exciting [and] not an ex-
perience I’ve had before,” said Garrett.

The Generals outshot the Monarchs

I5-l and took the lead in comer kicks as
well at 14-2.

Returning goaliejunior Emily Leary,
held strong in the goal for the Generals
for the entire game and recorded her
ﬁrst shutout of the season. Leary put up
a conference-leading 13 shutouts last
year. Her 0.54 goals-against average in
22 appearances meanwhile was good
enough for second in the conference and
20th in the nation.

The Generals will play Guilford Col-
lege on Saturday.

A pack of W&L women runners hit their stride during Saturday’s W&L Invite. The women’s team finished

first place overall.

Generals dominate W&L Invite  

Women ﬁnish ﬁrst and men ﬁnish Second in Season opener,

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee cross coun-
try teams opened the 2010 season with
top place ﬁnishes on their own turf. The
women’s team placed ﬁrst, and the men’s
team earned a second-place ﬁnish in the
W&L Invitational on Saturday.

 

Runners flash by during the men’s race at the Dick Miller Cross country

Course on Saturday morning.

On the women’s side, W&L sophomore
Lauren Schultz led the pack with an indi-
vidual ﬁrst-place ﬁnish at a time of 24: l 8.
Schultz comes into the season crowned
with ODAC laurels. Following her ﬁrst-
year showing last season, she took home
the title of ODAC Rookie of the Year and
earned All-ODAC honors.

New team additions also made their
mark on the course with three Top 15 ﬁn-
ishes. First-year Annelise Madison took
eighth with a time of 25:43 and Bella
Zuroski was close behind in llth place
with a time of 26:02. Fellow ﬁrst year
Ashley Gerard placed l3th with a time of
26:14.

“We have nine freshmen, which is the
most we’ve ever had since l’ve been at
W&L, and they all are really great,” said
senior captain Katherine Fenwick. “Each
one brings so much to the team.”

Fenwick, who returns for her fourth
season, took ﬁfth place with a time of
25:16. One of Fenwick’s goal for this sea-
son is to win the ODAC championship and
with this strong opening invite, the team is
already off to a great start.

“We’ve been training really hard for
the past few weeks, and we came out and
worked together really well,” F enwick
said. “And obviously it worked because
we won.”

Junior Matt Gossett gave the Generals
the top spot on the men’s side, earning ﬁrst
place honors with a time of28:56. Gossett
ﬁnished 22 in last year’s ODAC Champi-
onship race. He was joined in the top six

by sophomore returner Tyler Gehrs, who ,

took ﬁfth with a time of 29:21, and new-
comer Kane Thomas, who took sixth with
a time of29:24.

“There weren’t a ton of teams there,
but we were pretty happy with how we
ran,” Gossett said. “We lost our top two
guys from last year, but we still had three
guys in the top six.”

The Generals’ effort fell just short of
a top ﬁnish and Roanoke College went

home with the top prize. The Generals will
race again this Saturday in the Dickinson
Invitational in Pennsylvania. The men
start at 10:30 a.m. and the women run at
l2: l 5 p.m. '

Phinding the
phishers  

W&L ’s ITS staﬂ gives tips on

how to avoid e-mail scams

By Victoria Taylor
STAFF WRITER

When you get an e-mail urging you to send in
your password or other personal information in order
to keep your account from becoming invalidated, do
you do it? , ’

Absolutely not, said Jeff Overholtzer, the Direc-
tor of Strategic Planning and Communication for
the university’s Information Technology Services
department. ITS and legitimate organizations will
never ask for your password.

These e-mails represent typical “phishing” at-
tempts. Forget the bait and tackle; this kind of phish-
ing is thedeceitful process of attempting to gather
crucial information (such as usernames, passwords
and credit card numbers) through e-‘mails masquer-
ading as valid messages. And these attempts tend to
swell at the beginning of the academic year.

So what are the consequences of taking the bait?
According to Overholtzer, each threat has to be ex-
amined individually. When a user gives his pass-
word, the phisher can use it to take over his account
and in turn use that to send out more spam messages.
This could yield disastrous results. If a company like
Google or Yahoo, or another university starts to re-
ceive dangerous e-mails from a “wlu” account, they
could blacklist the university, thus putting up a bar-

ricade against all messages from Washington and -

Lee.

ITS and the other departments have put I25 hours
into‘ troubleshooting problems caused by phishing
since Jan. I, Overholtzer said. Last year, Overholtzer
said between 5 and 10 students reported falling vic-
tim to phishing attempts. Post-phish attack clean-up
can involve locking the student’s account and isolat-
ing the machine from the network. In other words, it
is a major inconvenience.

There is also the problem of identity theft. A suc— I

cessful phisher can access any person’s information
stored in an e-mail account, like the user’s social
security number and mother’s maiden name. Once
a user gives the phisher his password, the phisher
might be able to subsequently hack into the same
individual’s Facebook account and make use of all
of the information stored there.

Overholtzer said the university has surveillance
tools at multiple levels, antivirus software on all of
the campus desktops and more e-mail-speciﬁc soft-
ware and spam ﬁlters to protect users against phish-
ing attempts. The software has been intercepting
an estimated 800,000 phishing attempts a week for
faculty and _staff accounts, he said. Overholtzer es-
timates that the number is comparable or greater for
student accounts.

Education about phishing and other security is-
sues is key to preventing problems.

“Anyone who asks you to disclose information in
an e—mail is probably fraudulent,” Overholtzer said.

Phishing can get technical, so ITS has chosen to
use metaphors to make the message hit home for
students. Among their campaigns was as series of
posters that showed a few garden hoses and a snake,
asking the viewer to “ﬁnd the phish.”

Misspelled words, run-on sentences and improp-

er grammar are red ﬂags (or, in this case, the snakes I

among the garden hoses) to look for in that e-mail
asking for you to verify your account. Also, be leery
of threats that are too good to be true, like money of-
fers and messages urging you to act quickly. Check-
ing the e-mail address of the original sender can also
be helpful, as many phish attempts come from non-
edu addresses.

Overholtzer urged anyone who has questions re-
garding an e-mai|’s authenticity to ask ITS before
responding.

“No one should be embarrassed about asking ‘is
this real?’” he said. Even ITS staff members “have
had to look quite closely before we could decide.”

Kappa Sigma fraternity begins its much-anticipated recolonization on W&L is campus

By Valaree Tang
STAFF WRITER

The excitement and hope that the
Kappa Sigma national organization
and the school administration had
for Kappa Sigma at the close of the
2009-2010 school year has contin-
ued into the new recruitment season.

In an interview last year, Mic
Wilson, Executive Director of Kap-
pa Sigma, was conﬁdent that the fra-
ternity’s history and opportunity for
student leadership would attract new
members. Clay Coleman, Director
of Student Activities and Greek Life,
said he also thought that the frater-
nity would have a successful recruit-
ment.

Now that the new school year and
the new recruitment season have be-
gun, Coleman, and other members of
Kappa Sigma’s ‘national organization
and alumni are still optimistic about
successfully restoring the third old-
est chapter of Kappa Sigma at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Kappa Sigma’s recruitment pro-
cess will be facilitated by Trey Weit-
zel, Area 1 Recruitment Manager,
who is also managing over 60 other
chapters located between Canada
and North Carolina. Weitzel was one
of the founders of the Omicron Phi
chapter at Washington College in
2007.

Weiztel is mainly targeting ﬁrst-
year men since “there are not a lot of
guys interested in Greek life that are
not already in a fraternity,” he said.

Weitzel said that Facebook ad-
vertisements have already generated
some interest, and reported a “pretty
good” showing at the open-house
events. However, he expects the
number of people to ebb and wane.

“You might take two steps for-
ward and half a step back, but that’s
how it works... Slowly, one guy a
time, we’ll work toward our goal of

30 to 35 guys,” he said.

In addition to hosting open-house
events, Weiztel is trying to appeal to
ﬁrst-year men through the women on
this campus. He has delivered plat-
ters of cookies to each of the sorority
houses, and is planning to invite one
sorority to each of his open-house
events.

Last week, he invited the women
ofAlpha Delta Pi to the cookout and
open house. He said that because
ADPi recently colonized, he thought
they would be on the same wave-
length as Kappa Sigma. '

“I always like to build relation-
ships with the sororities because
they can be an asset. It’s always nice
to have ladies at the events,” said
Weitzel, who believes that women
have bearing on the decisions poten-
tial new members make in choosing’
a fraternity.

The event was also attended by
brothers "from the Lambda-Sigma
chapter at James Madison Univer-
sity, and the Nu-Sigma chapter at
Radford University.

Chaz Trant, a senior brother of
the chapter at J MU, was present at
the event to help Weitzel with the re-
cruitment event.

“I know how hard it is to recruit. I
was recruitment chair, and we really
wanted to help create a good atmo-
sphere for an event like this. It’s hard
to do it by yourself, so we wanted
to lend a hand,” said Trant, whose

grandfather was a member of Kappa

Sigma.

One of Weitzel’s tactics of re-
cruiting new members is to instill
a sense of the fraternity’s and the
W&L chapter’s rich history.

“This history is only so relevant
to people who aren’t in Kappa Sig-
ma, so I tell the guys: there are over

1,000 members of Kappa Sigma
who have been initiated through this
chapter, and there are a lot of alumni
that want this chapter to come back,”
Weitzel said. “You have an oppor-
tunity here, if you’re interested in
Greek life and you want an opportu-
nity to shape itjust the way you want
it to be. It’s an opportunity to leave a
legacy at W&L.”

The alumni of Kappa Sigma are
also supportive ofthe re-colonization
process. Trey Hart, who was a Kappa
Sigma brother at W&L from 2003 to
2006, believes that Kappa Sigma has
a lot to offer its new members.

“The new Kappa Sigma chapter
provides for a unique and exciting
opportunity for both upperclassmen
and freshmen to form their own start-
up fraternity that will form an iden-
tity all its own on campus. Kappa
Sigma has long held a storied place
in fraternity history at W&L and the
re—established chapter will have the
full support ofits alumni,” said Hart,
who is planning to help re-establish
the chapter.

Clay Coleman, Director of Stu-
dent Activities and Greek Life,
though hopeful, does not believe that
much of the recruiting success will
come from upperclass students.

“I’m thinking realistically, I don’t
think they will have much luck with
sophomores, and by that I mean,
I don’t think they’re going to get a
pledge class of 5, and I’ve shared
that with them,” said Coleman, who
believes that Kappa Sigma will have
its biggest success with ‘ﬁrst-year
studentsrather than upperclassmen.

However,‘ some _of the ﬁrst-year
students that are targeted do not
seem to be as excited as those who
are working behind the scenes of the
recruitment process. Some ﬁrst-year

men argue that re-colonizing the
chapter will be too time-consuming
while others give different reasons
for shrugging off the fraternity.
First-year students Timothy
Moore and Matt Ziemer said they
are not seriously considering Kappa

‘Sigma because the dynamics of the

fraternity are unclear since there are
not any existing members.

“I would only do it ifl knew a big
group of my friends were doing it
too,” said Ziemer.

Despite the opinions of the ﬁrst
years, both Coleman and Weitzel
believe that there is a place on the
W&L campus and in the Greek com-
munity for Kappa Sigma. '

“The student body is staying 80
percent Greek because we have or-
ganizations that aren’t all the same. I
think that people can ﬁnd a niche in
a home at Kappa Sigma, speciﬁcally
those who really want a challeng-
ing experience at developing their
leadership skills rather than solely
engage in the social environment,”
said Coleman.

Weitzel said that the fraternity is
looking for men who will uphold the
four pillars of Fellowship, Leader-
ship, Scholarship, and Service, as
well as respect their ideals as mem-
bers. He adds that the future brothers
of Kappa Sigma will be an asset to
the W&L community.

“We are coming on campus to ac-
tively participate in the Greek com-
munity, and we want to enhance what
is already here. Even with 15 other
fraternities, one more isjust going to
make it better,” said Weitzel.

The CIA comes a-calling at W&L

An upcoming information session will expose students to potential careers in the Central Intelligence/Ignecy

By Teresa Soley
STAFF WRITER

A Central Intelligence Agen-
cy recruiter will be visiting
Washington and Lee as a guest
of Career Services next Tuesday,
September 21.

Steven Peyton, Mid-Atlantic
Recruiter for the CIA, willbe
holding an information session
open to students of all years and
majors. Peyton will address top-
ics such as obtaining security
clearance, career opportunities
and student internships.

The CIA’s core values of
“Service, Integrity, and Excel-
lence” coincide with the values
embodied by W&L’s Honor Sys-
tem. Paired with W&L’s strong
academic tradition and involved

Wonderful widening W&L wireless  

student body, W&L students are
additionally appealing to recruit-
ers. W&L is a highly respected
institution and is ranked amoung
US News and World Report’s top
colleges, garnering the attention
of employers such as the CIA.

The CIA recruits from a di-
verse pool of both large and
small schools, but speciﬁcally
focuses on the Mid-Atlantic re-
gion (including Virginia) since
students from this geographic
area are most likely to be open
to relocation to the Washington

' D.C. area.

Liz Shupe, Associate Director
of Career Services, said she en-
courages “all students who might

be interested in learning about
full—time jobs and internships” to
come to the information session,
adding that students of “all ma-
jors, all class years are invited.”
In addition to the open infor-
mation session, the recruiter will
be‘ giving students the opportu-
nity to meet with him in a one-
on-one setting, in which he will
review and critique students’ re-
sumes and discuss future careers
with the CIA or other federal
government positions. Employ-
ment opportunities range from
clandestine service positions to
analytical positions to linguistics,
with opportunities in the scien-
tiﬁc and technological ﬁelds also

available. The CIA also offers
competitive student internship
programs. The application dead-
line for summer 2011 student
employment is October 15, and
requirements for application can
be found on the CIA website.
Kimberly Cole of Career
Services explains that “CIA
recruiting begins early in the
school year because of the time
it takes to earn a security clear-
ance, which is 9 to 12 months.”
The recruiter will explain this
process, as well as the different
career paths available within the
‘agency, during his information
session.
The CIA, and the federal gov-

ernment in general, typically hires
students of all majors and back-
grounds; however, “students with
international travel experience,
foreign language skills, and ex-
ceptional writing skills have the
best chance of being hired,” Cole
said. Recruiters are also seeking
students with “well-rounded pro-
ﬁles” who have strong academic
records and who are involved in
“extra-curricular activities such
as athletics and community ser-
vice,” according to Cole.
Careers in the CIA are not “as
seen on TV,” and recruiters seek
to dispel common myths about
professions in the agency when
visiting college campuses. “Re-

cruiters want to educate students

_ on the realities of working for the
agency,” said Ms. Cole, and this '

will certainly be the core of the
recruiter’s information session
this Tuesday. The information
session will be held in Huntley
Hall room 235 at 5 p.m., and ap-
pointments for individual meet-
ings may be scheduled by phone
or in person through the Career
Services ofﬁce.

Summer improvements make W&L wirless service faster and more powerful, despite early diﬁiculties

By Paige Gance
STAFF WRITER

Over the summer, Washing-
ton and Lee’s wireless Internet
service doubled in capacity, but
this improvement was not with-
out growing pains. Information
and Technology Services have
been hard at work ﬁxing issues in
the new system so that students

. can enjoy fast, glitch-free service
as classes get underway.

W&L’s Internet ‘connection
has jumped from 100 megabits
per second last year to 200 Mbps
this year. ITS has upgraded the
system to the “N” broadcast stan-
dard, the most advanced standard
available, allowing increased
speed, range and security.

But most transitions are a
little bumpy, and this one is no
exception. Erratic service has
plagued both Mac computers and
students in all ﬁrst-year dorms.

For Mac users, losses of con-
nectivity commonly occuired
when moving the computer on-
campus from an off-campus
location and after the computer

came out of sleep mode.

Mike Courtney, network en-
gineer for ITS, has been work-
ing with W&L’s service provider
ARUBA to address the problem
and they implemented a ﬁx this
past Wednesday.

“We think this has resolved
the issue,” said Courtney.

According to surveys on stu-
dent computer use, the number of
Mac users has increased steadily
every year, and Jeff Overholtzer,
director of strategicrplanning and
communications, believes the
number of Mac users now equals
the number of Windows users.
He encourages any Mac users
still experiencing problems with
connectivity to contact ITS with
details oftheir problem.

With regard to those students
having problems in the freshmen
dorms, Overholtzer said, “wired
technology is still better than the
best wireless technology.” He
cited the Ethernet jacks in each
dorm room as a fast, consistent

alternative to the wireless net-
work. _

. Besides these temporary is-
sues, the entire system overhaul
has been a signiﬁcant improve-
ment. Access now extends out
to every athletic ﬁeld, allowing
play-by-play coverage of sport-

Facebook, to 20 mbps out of the
available 100 mbps. Now, us-
ing a new tool called a “packet
shaper,” ITS has conﬁned the
restriction to business hours
only, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and
increased the allotted bandwidth
to 80 mbps. At all other times

“We are among the most advanced when com-

pared to peer schools in terms of speed, breadth

of coverage and secure access. ”

JEFF OVERHOLTZER, director ofstrategic planning

ing events onthe athletics web-
site. Recreational use of the In-
ternet, which Courtney deﬁnes
as “anything that’s fun,” has also
been allowed greater bandwidth
access.

Last year’s policy applied a
24/7 restriction of recreational
use, such as Youtube, Hulu and

during weekdays and all day on
weekends, recreational use is al-
lowed the full 200 mbps. Court-
ney even mentioned a possible
loosening of restrictions dur-
ing March Madness, when web
streaming is at its absolute peak.

In addition to the increased
speed and range of the new sys-

tem, the security is now airtight.
All data sent through the network
is encrypted to protect private in-
formation.

Along with the improvements
to W&L’s system, Rockbridge
County will soon get a network
upgrade of its own. As part of the
stimulus package program, the
Rockbridge Area Network Au-
thority won $7 million to build
a new data center to beneﬁt the
community. W&L will match
this grant up to $2.5 million and
the county is contributing anoth-
er $0.5 million.

The new data center, which
may be located on campus as
soon as 2012, would provide
faster Internet connection to ma-
jor utilities, ﬁre stations, police
stations, schools, hospitals and
local businesses.

According to a White House
press release, “studies link avail-
ability of broadband Internet ac-
cess to economic vitality.” Rural

Better off dead than co-ecl at W&L

Washington and Lee is problem with diversity is now starting to resemble its problem with gender 25 years ago

By Michele Farquaharson
co LU M NIST

One ﬁne day in Charlottes-
ville, Virginia, a senior woman
at UVA met a ﬁrst-year law
student who just graduated from
the esteemed Washington and
Lee. Upon their meeting she
noticed the bumper sticker on
the cooler he is carrying, which
reads: “W&L, Better off Dead
than Co-Ed.” Now, being the
calm, cool, sophisticated woman
that she is, she proceeds to stick
her ﬁnger in the man’s face and
berate him with how much of
an old-fashioned, fascist, low-
down, no-good, son of a. .. well
you get the idea. She ﬁnished
with this comment: “Just wait:
one ofthese days you’re going
to have a daughter, and all she’s
going to want to do is go to your
school and you are going to be
thrilled!”

Little did they know how
true that statement was, because
hey, here I am, about to gradu-
ate from W&L and let me tell
you, things have changed since
my dad graduated in 1985. Not

to give anybody the wrong
idea about my dad’s opinions
of co-ed education—he could
not be happier with my deci-
sion to' attend his alma mater,
and believes the addition of
women have boosted the qual-
ity of education at W&L as well
as increased its competitive-
ness with other elite liberal arts
institutions. So my question

is, ifa change as big as adding
women to W&L can occur with
such positive effects, why is it
that the biggest criticism of our
school is its lack of diversity?
Why does W&L seem to be
afraid of change? ’

I believe one of the reasons
is the strength of tradition on
campus. As the Class of 20l4_
has heard over and over again
for the past two weeks, W&L
is all about history and tradi-
tion. From the honor code and
the speaking tradition to leav-
ing Traveller’s door open and
not walking through the center
of the main entrance-way of

Graham-Lees, the history of
this place cannot help but in-
fect those on campus to fall in
line with the traditions of the
past. And as I hope most of you

statistics surpass those of cam-
puses twice our size and half our
caliber? How can you change a
place like W&L without losing
the traditions that made us all

“So why is it that we struggle with diversity;

that despite our honor system and behavioral

expectations, our sexual assault statistics sur-

pass those of campuses twice our size and half

our caliber? How can you change a place like
W&L without losing the traditions that made us

all apply?”

would agree that the education
you receive from W&L is truly
one of the ﬁnest.

So why is it that we struggle
with diversity; that despite our
honor system and behavioral
expectations, our sexual assault

apply?

In pursuit of these changes
I look to the steps that were
taken over twenty years ago
when W&L decided to admit
women. An honest discussion
was had throughout all walks of

life on campus addressing what
changes;would need to be made
in order to meet the desired goal
of admitting women.

At the time of these discus-
sions, my dad was a senior and
president of his fraternity. One
of the big concerns was the tra-
dition of Greek life on campus,
and what effects adding women
would have. The fraternity
presidents agreed that for Greek
life to continue on campus the
University would have to make
a conscious effort to bring in a
strong sorority system to create
equal opportunities for women
to participate in Greek life.
While fraternities outnumber so-
rorities on campus two-to-one,
these efforts resulted in sorority
row and six strong chapters of
Greek women, who contribute
daily to W&L’s tradition of
Greek life.

I’m not saying these changes

" were immediate, or that there

was not signiﬁcant trial and er-
ror, but they were made, and

they were successful in enrich-
ing and diversifying the W&L
community while also uphold-
ing the traditions of the school.

In looking to the future of
W&L and the changes I believe
need to be made in diversifying
the culture on campus, I hope
those involved remember to
have the necessary, if difficult,
discussions that preserve the
essential traditions that deﬁne
Washington & Lee while im-
proving upon this great place I
call home.

Nair For Men and other ramblings

T he best ginger pitcher at Washington and Lee shares his opinions on shaving, professional baseball and Southerners

By Patrick Smith
co LU M N I ST

Let me name a few things
guys hate: Justin Beiber, the un-
ﬂattering athletic shorts every
girl on this campus wears and
shaving.

Imagine ifNair came out
with a product for men‘? Let’s
face it. Shaving sucks unless
you’re Billy Mays, God rest
his soul. The product I’m talk-
ing about would be located in
the shower and used during a
shower.

Nair for Men would be a fan-
tastic smelling lotion one could
rub on their face and wash off,
resulting in a perfectly clean-
shaven face. Aside from apply-
ing an extremely acidic mixture
to your face, it sounds like a
great idea, right? Wrong.

Gotcha.

Now, since I have your at-
tention, let me get to my main
point. By the way, that little
introduction gimmick was the
dumbest shit that I have writ-
ten... excluding a certain prob-

lem I had back in elementary
school that somewhere around
15 percent of all boys go
through. It’s not a big deal (“Su-
perbad” reference, for anyone
who is totally lost). Now for my
main point: I’m talking about
Major League Baseball here,
people.

This is the time of year when
people like me get really pissed
off. The NFL season has started
and Major League Baseball has
once again taken a back seat. I
usually just deal with it, have a
four loco and blend in. But this

is the ﬁnal straw.

' Everyone needs to watch
MLB baseball right now. The
race for the playoffs is in full
stride, and what’s happening
around the league this season
is truly unbelievable. Just two
weeks ago, the Phillies took
the lead in the National League
East for the ﬁrst time since May.
After leading the NL West the
entire season, the San Francisco
Giants now have a half-game
lead over the San Diego Padres,
whose home city is named for a
whale’s vagina. Not to mention

Oh, and
he’s 3-1

in his last K

four starts

with 32

strikeouts

during that span.

Now, the main event of base-
ball: THE New York Yankees.
You may think that I’m just
some arrogant Yankees fan, and
you would without a doubt be
correct. People hate me for my
undying love of the Yankees,
and I love it.

The race for the American
League East crown between
the Tampa Bay Rays and the

  
  

Yankees is one of the best to
date. Rarely does it happen in
baseball when the clear two best
teams are in the same division.
The Rays travel to New York
for a four-game series tonight
at 7:05. When you watch this
matchup, realize that you are
watching the consummate base-
ball game.

OK, now that I got the mes- .
sage across, I feel a bit better
and want to tell ajoke. ‘

opinions

 

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS snrron

As a liberal at Washington
and Lee, I am ashamed to say
that it took me this long to start
reading “Game Change.”

As a liberal, reading John
Heilemann and Mark Halperin’s
detailed account of the 2008
election, released this past Jan-
uary, is like watching a sport’s
team championship DVD. Ev-

tastic campaign and had lots of
ingenuity and blah, blah, blah.
Ultimately, most American vot-
ers in 2008 were dissatisﬁed
with Bush and consequently
picked the polar opposite for

their next president. End of

story.
That led me to think (actu-
ally, needing an article topic

However, just because people of authority

on subjects profess to know a complicated

solution to a problem, it doesn ’t mean that

an easier answer isn ’t a better one.

 

ery paragraph reads like a giant
pat on the back to Obama, and
I couldn’t be happier to accept
the compliments.

Reading about McCain’s
handling of the ﬁrst debate
with Obama made me feel like
a Red Sox fan going to You-
Tube to see the Dave Robert’s
steal one more time; uncover-
ing Clinton’s strategy for Iowa
made me feel like a Saints fan
watching Manning’s face as he
threw to Tracy Porter in Super
Bowl XLIV.

Okay, enough sports analo-
gies. Once you get past the
championship highlights of
Obama’s campaign, the book
left me with one major conclu-
sion: Obama was going to win
from day one.

All 464 pages really can
be boiled down to “2008 was
a change election and Barack
Obama represented the most
change.”

It really could not be more
simple. Yes, Obama ran a fan-

24 hours before the deadline
led me to think) that there are
plenty other major stories and
problems in the world that are
made to seem much more com-
plicated than they really are.

‘ Crazy, right?

Okay, there are certainly
times when the simplest answer
or solution is not the right one.

Figuring out health care?
I don’t care where you stand
on the topic, health care is
one freaking complex solution
whatever you choose.

Registering for classes?
There is deﬁnitely no easy so-
lution to. get everyone into the
class they want.

Diagramming the various
friendship and relationship his-
tories of “Jersey Shore?” Deﬁ-
nitely complex. I don’t think
we’ve invented an algorithm to
solve that puppy yet.

Still, there are a couple of
times when the simple solution
is right.

Unfortunately, you probably

won’t ever ﬁnd out what that is
that simple solution. Making a
problem seem complex implies
that there are only a set amount
of people who can understand
the solution.

Therefore, it is advantageous
for whoever istelling you about
the problem—your friends,
newscasters, politicians—to
complicate the situation so they
can provide you with the exclu-
sive, complex answer.

By giving you an easy and
clear answer, these purveyors
of information would give up
their legitimizing power of ex-
clusive knowledge .

For example, who "would
pay an art professor to give lec-
tures on how to just throw col-
ors randomly onto something
white and make bank?

However, just because peo-
ple of authority on subjects
profess to know a complicated
solution to a problem, it doesn’t
mean that an easier answer
isn’t better. If you think that
the complicated jargon you are
learning in a class is bullshit,
then there’s a chance there’s an
easier answer.

So instead of spewing more
paragraphs of broad generaliza-
tions, I thought that I would ap-
ply this theory to three problems
I ran across over the summer.

For these three situations,
so called experts on the subject
consistently made something
simple seem much more multi-
faceted than it really was.

The ﬁrst major problem I
encountered this year was eye
contact.

Like many of you in‘ the
ADD generation, I tend to let
my eyes stray throughout the
day. During a lecture or a party,

it’s hard to keep from scan-

ning the room and see what
the rest ofthe world is up to.

So why is it when two
eyes randomly meet, espe-
cially from people of war-
ring sexes, there suddenly
becomes a flurry of mental
commotion?

You know what I’m talk-
ing about. Everytime eyes
randomly lock, there is that
inner ﬂutter instinctively es-
calating the situation.

There are three responses
every person has when com-
ing into sudden eye contact
with a stranger.

A) Upon eye contact,
an all-out offensive into
the peers subconscious be-

gins. The pupils are penetrated
against their will.

The look is accompanied
with a supposedly coy smile
that either says “I caught you
"red-handed” or “There’s an
open closet I know of that
seems lonely without you and
me inside it.”

B) When looking eyes,
the stranger changes a flat‘ex-
pression into one of aghast dis-
gust. The recipient is certain
that you, the initiator ofthe eye
contact, have been staring at
this person for the last hour des-
perately hoping for him or her
to acknowledge your presence.
By recoiling, he or she is telling
you to take down the shrine you
made in your closet from his or
her used gum.

C) Finally, most of the
time when two parties engage
in random eye contact, they turn
their attention sharply to some-
thing else. The best time for this
is in the library or at church or
synagogue when embarrassed
students go from initiating the
eye contact to suddenly check-
ing the ceiling for bats.

By engaging in easily the
stupidest human reﬂex, we all
pretend that by turning away
quickly, the other party will
probably just ﬁgure he or she
was mistaken in thinking that
you made eye contact.

Throughout adolescence, I

over-complication came when
news networks started cover-
ing the Deepwater Horizon oil
spill.

Every day, I had to hear
about how the magnitude of
this spill would rival the ef-
fects of Hurricane Katrina and
Exxon Valdez.

I also got hear, repeatedly,
about how BP was so evil that
they were replacing CEO Tony
Heyward with Jafar. I had to
hear about how Obama was
screwing this whole mess up
and should be impeached for
such a gross disregard for jus-
tice. "

According to the media,
this mess was going to have
consequences not seen since
the movie “Z012.” Jobs would
irreparably suffer and the Gulf
environment was damaged for-
even ‘

But guess what? BP and
Obama actually went about it
the right way. There weren’t
too many grand gestures and
sweeping overhauls, but have
you heard anything about oil in
the Gulflately?

The media silence is because
instead of detonating a nuclear
bomb at the bottom of the gulf,
BP took their time covering the
leak (they permanently covered
the leak yesterday) and weeks
later found out that 75 percent
of the dangerous light, sweet

Instead of focusing on all the various details

of how he or she looked at you, or what BP

was going to do with the spilled oil—or what
the Greenwich Boys and Girls Club had to
do with the Miami Heat—just ﬁnd the answer

in the basics.

 

made way too much of these
ocular encounters. My friends
and I would go into tremendous
detail analyzing every little ac-
cidental gaze.

It wasn’t until I started giv-
ing out the B look of feigned
disgust that I realized how stu-
pid all this was.

Instead of reacting so much
when we meet someone’s eyes,
why don’t wejust acknowledge
and continue? 99 percent ofthe
time that’s all we want to do
anyway.

My second problem with

crude oil in the gulfhad already
completely evaporated.

BP’s stock has more than
paid the price for the mistake,
and life is getting back to nor-
mal. Instead of turning into a
Katrina or an Exxon Valdez,
this spill was more like Ixtoc,

Mexico in I979 and the Gulf»

War oil spill in 1991. There’s
a reason you haven’t heard of
these spills. It’s because they
had an equally simple solution,
and their spilled oil evaporated
just as quickly. ‘

My ﬁnal major problem with

Solving problems the easy way

Issues in personal and private lives tend to get needlessly over-complicated when it comes to ﬁnding the right solution

over-complication came during
the most important event of the
summer: LeBron taking his tal-
ents to South Beach.

Being an ESPN addict, I
scoured the Internet daily to
ﬁnd out LeBron’s possible mo-
tives behind playing second
ﬁddle to Dewayne Wade.

I spent hours researching the
legitimacy of Delonte West’s
alleged affair with LeBron’s
mom during the playoffs last
year

I followed Twitter accounts,
listened to Stephen A. Smith
and used pretty much every
other embarrassing method of
attaining information on LeB-
ron.

This turned out to be a huge
waste of time. Well, obviously
it was because I was reading
about a free agent signing in
a professional sport, but even
in that realm I should have fo-
cused on the obvioussolution
that was staring me in the face.

LeBron ultimately had to
choose between living in Chi-
cago, Cleveland, New York or
Miami for at least the next ﬁve
years of his life. Keep in mind
that he .wouldn’t live in his
home city during the summer
because he will be busy doing
basketball camps around the
world.

So basically, LeBron had to
choose between spending Sep-

’ tember through June in Chi-
cago, Cleveland, New York or
Miami.

Are you serious? What 25
year-old who is getting paid
to play a sport is choosing to
live in the cold and snow when
there is a beach with clubs adja-
cent to it?

Seriously, who isn’t making
the same decision as LeBron
there? ~

Instead of focusing on all
the various details of how he or
she looked at you, or what BP
was going to do with the spilled
oilﬂor what the Greenwich
Boys and Girls Club had to do
with the Miami Heat—just ﬁnd
your answer in the basics.

Its really that simple.

Getting physical with

Campus Rec encourages W&L students to become involved in one of its many activities

By Katie Boe
STAFF WRITER

Campus Recreation is one
of the largest organizations on
Washington and Lee’s campus.
Whether you’re looking for ex-
ercise classes, an outdoor adven-
ture or intramural team sports,
Campus Rec provides opportuni-
ties for all students to stay active.
Campus Rec encompasses many
of the university’s extracurricu-
lar trips and activities.

James Dick oversees Campus
Rec and has developed the pro-
gram to itscurrent state. Before
his arrival as director of Campus
Rec, the Athletic Department
and various other departments

oversaw branches of the organi-
zation. Dick absorbed many of
those responsibilities and now
directs a major hub of student
extracurricular life.

Campus Rec staff hires na-
tionally certiﬁed instructors for
all group exercise classes. The
teaching staff is a mix of profes-
sional instructors, W&L faculty
members and even some stu-
dents.

Campus Recreation hopes to
offer a certiﬁcation course to all
students interested in becoming
certiﬁed instructors.

Campus Rec started off the

academic year with a series of
events such as a free zumba class,
a rafting trip and an introduction
to salsa class.

This year’s additions to the
Campus Rec offerings include
group exercise classes featuring
kickboxing and zumba, club wa-
ter polo and club disc golf have
been added. James Dick has re-
designed the ropes course that
is a part of the Outing Club, and
even offers a new PE class on the
ropes course.

92 percent of W&L students
participate in intramural sports,
one of Campus Rec’s offerings.

W&L’s participation rate rivals
that of larger universities rate,
according to Ray Ellington,
Campus Rec’s Assistant Director.
Many compete for their respec-
tive sororities or fraternities, but
any student or group can register
a team for any intramural sport.
Flag football and basketball are
the two most popular intramural
sports.

Campus Recreation’s broad
offerings also include Washing-
ton Break and Spring Break trips
to many different locations. A
vacation to the Outer Banks in
North Carolina entails kayaking,

ﬁshing, and sightseeing. Another
trip to New Mexico offers hiking
and a trip to a hot spring.

The Outing Club also spon-
sors PE 195, a scuba diving in-
struction class offered Fall Term
and Spring Term. Students can
also rent equipment for many
outdoor activities from both the
Outing Club and from intramu-
rals. Equipment for ultimate fris-
bee, bocce ball and even poker is
available for rent.

This year, Campus Rec made
changes to the registration pro-
cess. A simpliﬁed registration
for all branches of Campus Rec

Campus Rec

is on the W&L website. All re-
quired forms are also available
for download from the website.

Alum teaches children through lyrics

William Avery, class of ‘9I, seeks to enlighten children through his music and songs in his CD “Learning Buﬂet”

By Julie Hansen
STAFF WRITER

At Washington and Lee, the
liberal arts education encourages
and ignites interdisciplinary con-
nections and passions among its
students. It is this ability to ap-
proach singular subjects from
multiple disciplines that stays
with W&L students their entire
lives. In this case, I’m talking
about William Avery, W&L class
of ’9l.

During his years here, he said
he used music as an outlet for
stress, gaining most of his inspi-
ration from -hectic ﬁnals weeks.
In fact, while his fellow students
were cramming, Avery spent his
time playing piano. To the sur-
priseof his friends, it was those

piano sessions that helped him ‘

pass. By focusing on a creative
outlet, Avery used his personal
talents to distract and relax him-
self. Feeling like you’re prepared
really is half the battle.

His sophomore year, Avery

had the chance to study abroad
in Taiwan, where he met his fu-
ture wife (don’t get too excited,
Generals: W&L does not guar-
antee love with any of its study
abroad programs). After retum—
ing to W&L to ﬁnish his major,
Avery returned to Taiwan for
the love of his life. There, he
spent 10 years teaching English
as a second language, published
educational materials and even
tried his hand at acting. Since
he learned Chinese at W&L, he
hosted an educational children’s
show for teaching Chinese!
Now, this takes us back to
the present. After returning to
the United States and pursuing a
career in computers, Avery never
lost his love of children, educa-
tion and music. This is where
“Leaming Buffet” comes in, a
32 track CD that features songs
about everything from the ABCs
to different, difﬁcult phonics

tones, to the months and even the
skeleton! My personal favorites
are “America, the Grand Tour
(50 State Capitals)” and “ABC
Chant—ABC Animals.”
Musically, “Leaming Buf-
fet” tends to fall short. While
the introductory track, “Really
(lnstrumental)” was quite musi-
cally sound, the rest of the CD
focuses much more on mono-
tone “rapping” and synthesizer.
Now, as I am over 10 years old
and have no younger siblings, I
cannot fully predict a child’s ap-
preciation of this music. How-
ever, it seems that without basic
tunes for children to follow it
might be more difﬁcult for them
to remember the words. Look at
The ABC Song, the Alphabetical
State Song and the planet song
from “Blue’s Clues”... I still
sing those songs in my head
when looking through a diction-
ary, counting license plates or

studying astronomy.

Also, a lot of Avery’s words
are a bit sophisticated for a
younger audience. While “Read-
ing is Fundamental” deﬁnitely
made me giggle, I’m not so sure
that little kids will be able to fol-
low his words so quickly. And,
again, almost every single song
makes excessive use of synthe-
sizer. Avery might be better off
focusing on exposing children to
higher quality and more complex‘
music to which they might not be
otherwise exposed. Synthesized,
auto-tuned songs ﬁll the radio
these days, along with droning
lyrics that blur together. Avery
should take this opportunity to
use his musical talents to focus
on making music that children
can enjoy and that will encour-
age them to appreciate different
instruments and styles, rather
than just the current popular cul-
tural trends. v

While I’m not the keenest on
his musical styles, I must stress
that many of his songs do pres-
ent important information for
children to learn that may not be
so prevalently taught in schools,
including “American Presidents”
and “My Good Friend (Learn
Chinese).” I mean, I’m a col-
lege freshman and I still don’t
know all of the state capitals,
the bones in the body or the US
Presidents-«let alone in chrono-
logical order!

Either way, Avery has simply
made an excellent effort in fol-
lowing his passions while pre-
senting elementary knowledge
that the whole family should
have. If he uses the outstanding
information that he is present-
ing in “Leaming Buffet,” and
instead sets it to more complex,
instrumentally driven music of
which I am sure he is capable,
with clever sing-along tunes, he

will no doubt be a great success.
Whether or not Avery contin-
ues making music for children,
I’ll be listening to “American
Presidents” on my iPod until l’ve
got all 44, and their respective
facts, down pat. My US History
teacher would be so proud.

Working alongside Cy Twombly

Local professor spoke to W&L students about her experience working with the esteemed artist in Paris

By Mary Helen Turnage
STAFF wrmsn

This past Wednesday, Profes-
sor Barbara Crawford of South-
ern Virginia University gave a
lecture about her experiences
working at the Louvre with artist
Cy Twombly, W&L class of] 953.
Lenfest’s Keller Theater was full
of students, faculty members and
Rockbridge County locals who
wanted to hear ﬁrst-hand about
Crawford’s work at perhaps the
most celebrated art museum in
the world.

As she clicked through doz-
ens of photographs projected on
the screen behind her, Crawford
described the intricate process

Wine festival succeeds again

of installing a modern mural for
the ceiling ofthe Louvre’s classi-
cally decorated Salle des Bronz-
es. Twombly asked Crawford to
come to Paris to mix the colors
for the colossal painting he de-
signed. Nothing less than perfec-
tion was acceptable. Crawford
discussed the hours of analyzing
she did in the studio and in the
Salle des Bronzes in order to ﬁnd
the ideal blues, grays, and yel-
lows for the mural.

Though the Louvre could
have afforded any technology
for the project they desired, the
staff relied on the human eye to

judge the colors effectively. With
such limited use of technology,
Crawford kept notes in excru-
ciating detail of the percentages
and dabs of paint used for the
mural. Throughout the lecture,
Crawford alluded to David and
Goliath to describe her experi-
ence with the giant mural in such
a respected museum. She kept
notes and dabbed paint on 8xll
paper and stored the excruciat-
ingly analyzed paint in plastic
food containers.

When the correct colors
for the mural had been ﬁnally
chosen, it was time to paint

the several canvases to cover
the ceiling. In order to capture
Twombly’s famous artistic spirit
and rhythm, the staff used’ all
sorts of brushes—even different
kinds of brooms.

The gluing of the painted can-
vases to the ceiling took a total
of two months. During this tran-
sitional period, a covered corri-
dor served as the passageway in
the Salle des Bronzes for Louvre
tourists to walk from one wing of
the museum to the other.

Professor Crawford described
the ﬁnal product as “perfect”
and proudly stated that critics

referred to the ceiling mural as
an experience “like being under-
water and in the sky at the same
time.” When an audience mem-
ber asked to hear her favorite
part of the experience, Crawford
did not hesitate to answer that
the camaraderie of the staff was
the best part of her work at the
Louvre.

“Having seen the exhibit this
Spring Term when l was visiting
the Louvre, I was so impressed
and intrigued by it that I didn’t
even think about how they cre-
ated and ‘installed something of
that size, said junior art history

major Emily Rigame. “Hearing
Barbra Crawford speak about the
process made me realize just how
impressive and groundbreaking
the installation is.” Art history
majors and non-majors, as well
as many of Professor Crawford’s
SVU students attended the rivet-
ing lecture.

The annual Rockbridge Wine Festival set record attendanceion September I] at the Lime Kiln Theatre

By Marie Locke
STAFF WRITER

On a beautiful fall day last
Saturday, students, local resi-
dents and tourists headed to the
Lime Kiln Theater for the six-
teenth annual Rockbridge Wine
Festival. The festival featured an
appealing combination of food,
wine tasting and music provided
by Pop Rivets.

The festival was sponsored
and organized by the Rockbridge
County Chamber of Commerce.
It featured twelve vineyards, each
of which brought several dif-
ferent wines for tasting. Bottles

of wine were also available for
purchase. Sammy Moore, execu-
tive Director of the Chamber of
Commerce, said that the invited
vineyards are generally within an
hour or two’s drive of Lexington.
He noted that there are about 20
vineyards in Charlottesville and
Albemarle County. Many medal
winners from the Virginia Wine
Competition were represented,
including Barboursville Vine-
yards, DelFosse Vineyards and
Winery, Fincastle Vineyard &
Winery, Horton Cellars Win-

ery and Kluge Estate Winery &
Vineyard.

Festival attendees were seri-
ous, yet enthusiastically tast-
ing the many different available
wines. Most festivalgoers paid
$10 to $15 (depending on ad-
vance or at-the-door purchase),
which entitled them to tastings
and a souvenir wine glass.But
mixed into the crowd were the
designated drivers who, in return
for their abstinence, received a
reduced admission fee.

In addition to the many inter-

esting wines, local restaurants
offered an array of tantalizing
treats for purchase. Participating
restaurants included the Southern
Inn, Virginia ‘Q and Salemo’s.
According to Moore, the fes-
tival was a great success, having
the largest attendance in the last
ﬁve years. There were approxi-
mately one thousand attendees.
About 60 percent of the crowd
consisted of local students and
residents. Moore thought it was
“ironic” to have a record year
when the festival was “as bare

bones and basic as it’s ever been.”
Proﬁts from the festival beneﬁt
the Chamber of Commerce.
Moore says he has already
started planning for next year.
He indicated that the Chamber of
Commerce is doing substantial
marketing research for next year ’s

festival. He noted that many of ,

the attendees have become aware
of the festival through the Inter-
net. There are also numerous re-
turn patrons, and local~W&L and
VMI students are always well
represented. Moore said he wel-

comes student volunteers at the
Chamber of Commerce. In past
years, students have provided
valuable marketing assistance.
Anyone who is interested should
contact Moore at the Chamber of
Commerce.

The Chamber of Commerce
is also planning a dinner dance in
February and a golf tournament
in June 2011.

1-1 in weekend play for Generals

W&L defeated Guilford 1-0 on Saturday, but fell to Greensboro 2-0 on Sunday

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee women’s
soccer team knocked off its ﬁrst ODAC
opponent with a l-0 victory over Guil-
ford College on Saturday, but dropped its
second game of the season in a 2-0 loss

to Greensboro College on Sunday. The
Generals are now 2-2 overall and 1-0 in
ODAC conference play.

In the Guilford match-up, a shutout
from junior goalie Emily Leary and a
goal from sophomore midﬁelder Ainsley
Daigle secured the win for W&L. Daigle
ﬁred away early in the second half to
give the Generals the lead and silence the
Quakers.

“l wasjust really excited because we’ve
had so much trouble scoring,” Daigle said.
“We’ve gone into halftime without scor-
ing so manytimes.” ‘

W&L held a 7-5 advantage over Guil-
ford in shots and a 6-1 lead in corner
kicks.

On Sunday, the Generals put up a
tough ﬁght, but it wasn’t enough to hold
off the Pride of Greensboro College. Nei-

year forward Mary Randolph. Another
goal from sophomore midﬁelder Meredith
Kelly late in the second halfset the Pride’s
lead at 2-0 and kept the Generals from a
comeback. 0

However, the lopsided scoreboard be-
trayed the shot count as the Generals led
the Pride 16-4 in shots. W&L also held a
7-1 advantage in corner kicks.

V “We just need to work on scoring,’
Daigle said. “That’s been our biggest is-
sue is to score early rather than let teams
hang around.”

The Generals will hit the road this
week as ODAC competition begins to
pick up. W&L will play at Randolph Col-
lege on Wednesday at ‘6 p.m. and then be
back on Watt Field on Saturday for an 1 1

Dining .
Services goes
green

New take-out boxes part
of an eﬂortto increase
sustainability

By Paige Gance
STAFF WRITER

During orientation week, 25 freshmen and 25 up-
perclassmen received free eco-takeout containers to
use in the marketplace. The system works by allow-
ing students to trade in a wooden token for a takeout
box, ‘which they use and then return back to the mar-
ketplace to get their token back.

Participants in the pilot program will soon give
official feedback on how well the program works.
The one-month test is set to end Oct. 10.

The new containers are both larger and sturdier
then the current paper and oil-based to-go boxes.
This means no more soggy, overstuffed cardboard.
But the real benefit is in their sustainability.

They are made from renewable plastic and, at
other schools with this system, like the University of
Florida, they have lasted for several years. U Florida
reports that they only had to replace approximately
10 percent of their containers per year.

While all marketplace cups, plates, and plas-
tic ware have been biodegradable for the past two
years, Dining Services feels that in light of the Rock-
bridge County landﬁll closing in 2012, even this is
not enough.

“Dining Services is trying to do everything it
can for sustainability,” said Chris Carpenter, spe-

“Dining services is trying
to do everything it can for
sustainability... the program
works. ”

Chris carpenter, Dining Services

cial projects coordinator with Dining Services. Past

. projects include environmentally safe dishwashing,

going tray-less in the dining hall and buying more
locally produced food.

At this point, it seems that this new program will
be added permanently to the list of W&L’s green
initiatives because there has been “no feedback that
would make us pause,” said Carpenter. “The pro-
gram works.” He has already received e-mails from
students praising the eco-takeout boxes.

‘ Research for this program started three years ago,
after U Florida implemented the system with great

success. The program worked so well that W&L had _

to get in line while the industry caught up to demand
from colleges across the country. -

The program is scheduled to go public on Oct.
15, assuming positive reviews from the pilot group.
At this time, students must pay approximately $3 of
cash, food debit or general debit for the to-go boxes,
but this will be a “one-time purchase,” said Carpen-
ter, “Just don’t lose your token.”

Marketplace Director Dennis Fowler estimates
that dining services will have to order between 300

and 400 containers just to get started. These contain- 5

ers will be available for drop-off and pick-up at the
Marketplace, Cafe’ 77 and the sorority houses.

The
(SEAL) and the W&L Food Council have also been
involved with the pilot program, according to a
W&L news release. ‘

Carpenter said that W&L’s push for sustainability
goes right along with its motto, “Not Unmindful of
the Future.” .

“We have a great responsibility,” he said of Din-
ing Services, which is “still part of the education
structure.” For Carpenter, the green initiative simply
reinforces what is taught in any environmental sci-'
ence or bioethics classroom.

To taste Dining Services’ commitment to sustain-
ability by buying local food, stop by the Fall Har-
vest Dinner this Wednesday. Going green has never
tasted so good.

The new Washington and Lee
Hillel House was dedicated Saturday
Sept. 25 at the end of a celebratory
weekend full of events.

Thursday night Hillel hosted a
speech by’ Ruth Messinger, presi-
dent of the American Jewish World
Service. She spoke ofJews as global

staff, parents and alumni. Vice Presi-
dent of Hillel Rimona Carton said,
“The entire W&L community com-
ing together for this special weekend
made me truly appreciate everything
W&L has done to help bring this
wonderful Hillel House to our cam-
pus.” The service was followed by a

Ruscio, who spoke on the complete
involvement of the W&L commu-
nity in bringing a‘ Hillel house to
campus. '

According to Ruscio, “our build-
ings [at W&L] reflect our values.”-
He told of the generous ‘donations of
the members of the Board of Trust-

Mark Grunewald. The new women’s
choir under the direction of Shane
Lynch sang “Shalom Chaverim”
in celebration of the event. After
the ceremony, the E. Café offered
samples of bagels and was open for
lunch. Tours were also provided.
The Hillel House serves as both
a home for the Jewish community
of W&L and Lexington, and as a
space accessible to the entire W&L

' community. The inulti-purpose room

can host lectures and classes as well
as Hillel services. For the ﬁrst time,

 Lexington is home to a Torah, the
 , scrolls containing the sacred Jewish

texts, which is housed in this room.
The E. Cafe, a student lounge and a

kosher community kitchen make up

the rest of the downstairs. Offices and
a conference room used to host both
seminars and meetings complete the

 ‘second story ofthe building.

Remembering Granvi

A tribute to an amazing young man whose legacy, intelligence ana’ personality will not be forgotten

By Diandra Spicak and Eleanor Kennedy

MANAGING AND NEWS EDITORS

“Granvil was the type of per-
son who made others happy,”
said senior Susan Taylor.

With eyes that lit up behind
wire—rimmed glasses, Granvil
George, a member of the class
of 2011, brought joy to all those
who knew him. Diagnosed with
germ cancer in December while
studying abroad at Oxford, Gran-
vil seemed more concerned with
how his illness would affect ev-
eryone else. He would engage in
normal activities with his friends
and family, crushing them in
games like Scrabble.

A quick perusal of the com-
ments left on Granvil’s F acebook
wall show just how much of an
impact he had on those around
him, from brightening a friend’s
day in class or inspiring another
to live up to higher academic
standards. Granvil did not dis-
criminate but forged friendships
with everyone. Quiet and hum-
ble, the thin boy from Charleston
had a way with people.

“My life is layered with
his positive impact,” said Jes-
sica Jones, another classmate of
Granvil’s. “No one so amiable
and laid-back could provide the
ﬁnest guidance for the nitty-
gritty situations in life. No one
so young could know so much.
No one so skinny could eat that

much. No one who is so addicted
and devoted to Arrested Devel-
opment, Frisbee and Boggle
could be so academically unpar-
alleled.”

Granvil’s dedication to aca-
demics began at an early age.
Interested in everything he stud-
ied, he latched on to varying sub-
jects ranging from chemistry and
Spanish, theology and philoso-
phy. He always seemed to have
his nose in a book.

His passion for learning did
not wane when he started at
Washington and Lee. A double
major in philosophy and neu-
roscience, Granvil was a Lewis
Scholarship recipient, a Uni-
versity Scholar and a member
of both Phi Eta Sigma and Phi
Beta Kappa honorary societ-
ies. He consistently made the
Dean’s List and the honor roll.
He made a perfect score on the
Graduate Record Exam (GRE)
and planned to attend graduate
school for philosophy.

According to senior Sam
Gilleran, Granvil was “simply
brilliant.”

“He was always overloading
to take 17, I8, 19 credits because
he had an unquenchable thirst for
knowledge and he had the ability
to process it all,” Gilleran said.

But Granvil was more than

Granvil George was one of the most-loved students at
W&L. According to senior Susan Taylor, “Granvil was the
type of person who made others happy.”

just an excellent student. For phi-
losophy professor James Mahon,
Granvil was a valued friend who
always made life a little more fun.
When Mahon e-mailed Granvil
to tell him he’d been accepted
to study at Oxford, Granvil ﬁrst
responded, “I joyfully accept the
position and am very grateful for
the selection.”

Moments later, Mahon found
another e-mail in his inbox. With
the subject line, “on a less for-
mal note,” Granvil had written,
“Hooray!”

Mahon says he will always
remember Granvil as that same
joyous young man who was “al-
ways laughing, always smiling.
And tall.”

Even those who did not know
Granvil particularly well recog-
nized that he was an impressive
young man. Junior Clarke Mor-
rison knew Granvil only from a
few interactions during the short
time they were -on this campus
together. Still, Morrison said he
recognized Granvil as “a meek
man” with a “quiet strength.”

This strength came from
Granvil’s steadfast faith, a qual-
ity which deﬁned him. He be-
longed to both the Generals
Christian Fellowship and the Re-
formed University Fellowship.
Senior Beth Valentine took sev-
eral classes with Granvil, was his
teammate in the Ethics Bowl and
attended the same church he did
for a time. She said that Granvil’s
faith “was very obvious in all of
his interactions.”

Perhaps it was this faith that
made Granvil so optimistic, even
when discussing the difficult sub-
ject of his cancer. Valentine said
she felt like Granvil spent more
of his time comforting those who
were worried about him than
looking for their comfort.

When Granvil e-mailed his
friends to tell them of his illness,
Taylor said he focused on the
science of it, since many of his
peers were in the sciences. Even
in the face of such unpleasant

I George  

news, Granvil was eager to re-
main positive and share his thirst
for knowledge with others.

This passion for sharing
knowledge, for teaching and
learning from his peers, is one
of the qualities Mahon appreci-
ated most about Granvil. Mahon

I took great pleasure in the books

that Granvil recommended him,
something few other students
have ever done.

While Granvil was abroad,
Mahon sent him an e-mail de-
scribing the novels of Stieg Lars-
son as “the latest intellectual
must—read.”

Granvil responded, with
characteristic intelligence and
wit, “Ahh, the latest intellectual
must—read, that makes sense.
Those tend to be fun; I at least
always enjoy being able to dis-
cuss Umberto Eco. I actually saw
a big advertisement in the Prague
metro today for one of his books,
which made a nice change from
the far more ubiquitous Twilight
advertisements.”

That’s how Mahon says he
likes to think of one of his bright-
est and best students: “Standing
on a metro platform in Prague,
about to explore the world.”

Saying good bye to a good friend

A group of Washington and Lee students heads to-Alum Springs, W. Va. for Granvil George is funeral

By Sam Gilleran

COPY EDITOR, SUBMITTED VIA TEXT MESSAGE

The Forks of Coal Baptist
Church in Alum Springs, W. Va.,
was ﬁlled beyond capacity Sun-
day night as mourners assembled
to remember Granvil George.

Four eulogizers, including
W&L Prof. James Mahon, re-
membered Granvil as a gregari-
ous and brilliant student. The
service began promptly at 5 p.m.
with pealing bells.

There were several selections
sung by the church choir, as well
as instrumental interludes in be-

tween speakers. The comforting
words of the eulogies, which
quoted Psalm 23 and other tra-
ditional Scriptures, failed to halt
the tears throughout the country
church; the numerous anecdotes
recollecting Granvil’s sense of
humor provided welcome laugh-
ter to lighten the somber mood in
the hall.

After the service, the church
provided a dinner of fried chick-
en, mashed potatoes and other
vegetables.

About 40 students made the
trek from Lexington to Alum
Springs to memorialize Granvil.

The Office of Student Affairs
rented a charter bus, which left
the parking deck at noon, to ac-

was Granvil and the way he loved people. It

community members wishing to
travel to the funeral.

“It was nice to see the place
where Granvil came from, his
family and friends,” said senior
Christian Roden, who lived
across the hall from Granvil his
freshman year.

Crystal Spencer, a senior who
was on RA staff with Granvil, re-
ferred to it as the happiest funeral
she had ever attended, while an-
other attendee said, “It really ex-

pressed the array that was Gran-
vil and the way he loved people.
It felt warm.”

An on-campus memorial ser-
vice will be held Friday after-
noon. University College, Ox-
ford, where Granvil attended as
the W&L exchange student last
year, also held a memorial ser-

The women of W&L: then and now

First president of Panhel speaks to W&L about the ways things have changea’, for better or worse, since her time here

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

The classrooms of Washing-
ton and Lee are quieter than they
used to be, according to W&L
alumnus and ﬁrst-ever Panhel-
lenic Council president Jane Lee
Forster. ’

Last Thursday, Forster gav
a speech about how much W&L
has changed since it ﬁrst became
a co-ed institution, 25 years ago.
Forster was a member of the
class of 1990, the second co-ed
class at the university.

Forster said that there seems
to be a pressure on present-day
W&L women to be somewhat
unobtrusive and inconspicuous
in the classroom. This contrasts
with the account provided of the
ﬁrst classes of W&L women,
whom she described as being
“audacious.”

These women, according to
Forster, were willing to take big
risks. ‘‘I think we had to be,” she
said.

These risk-taking women
were members of a W&L com-
munity that is very different

from the one that exists today. ‘
‘ and the creation of a Panhellenic

Lexington was even smaller 25
years ago than it is now, and
there were not very many oppor-
tunities for women on campus to
interact with one another social-
ly. Women could not meet up on
the weekends to go to Pumpkin-
seeds or Alvin Dennis, which did
not have a women’s department
back then; there was no sushi
restaurant where these women

could chat and dine on spicy tuna
rolls. Even the number of ladies’
restrooms on campus was insuf-
ﬁcient—another crucial blow to
the social life of the W&L wom-
en. Predominantly male fratemi-
ty parties comprised pretty much
the entire social scene. '

“We decided to take control of
our own destiny,” Forster said.

In order to do this, Forster and
other women of her class with
strong leadership skills founded
a women’s forum called Trident.
This forum was a social outlet for
women, providing opportunities
for interaction and discussion.

One example of this collabo-
ration was the social event that
Trident coordinated called Con-
fetti. Confetti was the ﬁrst social
function at W&L where one had
to be invited by a woman in or-
der to attend, and it was a major
success.

The innovation of the W&L
women paid oﬂ‘ with Confetti,

and it was then on to a much larg— ‘

er endeavor: the colonization of
the ﬁrst three sororities at W&L

Council to oversee them.

“I didn’t do anything magical,
but I did stand up,” Forster said
when she discussed her role as
the ﬁrst president of Panhel. This
idea drove much of her speech;
the idea that all a woman on this
campus has to do in order to be a
leader is to speak up and express

_ her ideas to others.

Forster said that sororities
became a “perfect vehicle” for
leadership and service opportu-
nities, as they still are today.

Forster touched on some of

the aspects of the W&L commu-
nity of the present day that may
be cause, not for concern, but
for action on the part of W&L
women.

“I think that gender relations
have regressed a little bit,” For-
ster said, after she discussed the

change in the way that women
seem to behave in the classroom
these days.

started something and now it is
time for this generation of W&L
women to pick up where they
left off, she said.

Forster described the current
composition of the Executive
Committee and the Student Judi-
cial Council as an enigma. While

women now make up about 50
percent of the student body, they
do not occupy anywhere near 50
percent of the seats in the gov-

While Forster conceded that
she may not have done anything
magical, she was a part of a cata-
lyst for a huge and lasting change
on this campus: the inclusion of
women in the Greek system.

Non incautus futuri: not un-
mindful of the future. This is

the motto of our school, a motto
that the women working to cre-
ate Panhel at W&L frequently
recalled. Forster urged current

By John Paul Frehner
COLUMNIST

Part I : Some Democrats excited about report that
announces the recession long over

Controversy has erupted over
the consensus of the National
Bureau of Economic Research’s
Business Cycle Dating Commit-
tee.

On Sept. 17, they declared
that the recession started in Dec.
2007, has been over since June
2009, lasting a total of eighteen
months. Also dubbed the worst
recssion since the Great Depres-
sion, this recession is now of-
ﬁcially four months longer than
any of the other recessions in the
Post-Depression Era.

This means that, according
to the National Bureau of Eco-
nomic Research, the recession
has been over fora year and three.

that year’s time the national un-
employment rates went up past
10 percent before coming back
to the current ﬁgure?

Bank-owned homes still

the Sun Belt, the places hard-
est hit by recession due to their
heavy exposure to the sub-prime
loan market from the middle of
the last decade. This means that
residential recovery is not suc-
ceeding where it is most needed.

Home sales were expected to
increase in the last quarter, but
did not.

However, the stock market
responded well to the report. The

three months without improve-

ﬁdence in the economic policies
endorsed by these individuals.

This behavior comes at a time
when they certainly have incen-
tive to boast about economic
“improvements”: on the eve of a
midterm election where the GOP
is projected to swing back hard,
perhaps even to retake Con-
gress. .
Most politicians know that,
among voters, the economy acts
as the primary voting criterion
at the polls. And nowadays, the
Democrats do not have the nec-

months. However, the ﬁfteen
months since the recession sup-
posedly ended have been charac-
terized by abysmal ﬁow of credit
and a recovery of 749,779 jobs
out of over 7 million lost (ac-
cording to recovery. gov). The
national unemployment average
is hovering around 9.6 percent as
of last month. However, certain
states are still have unemploy-
ment rates as high as 14 percent

. (source: Bureau of Labor Statis-

tics).

There has not been a marked
improvement as of yet; rather,
the economy just seemsto have
bottomed out for a while.

Most of the current economic
data is relatively unchanged
from one year ago, right after the
recession supposedly ended.

Did I forget to mention that in

three days following the report
was one of the ﬁrst truly marked
upswings since the recession ap-
parently ended, but this upswing
is unsurprising considering the
effect of expectations on mar-
kets.,

Granted, the agreed deﬁni-
tion of a recession is a period of
economic contraction; however,
the end of this contraction is not
necessarily the beginning of new
expansion. Furthermore, expan-
sion seems increasingly doubtful
considering the many worries
that developed nations will have
a slow recovery, maybe even a
second recession.

omy, a few leaders of the Dem-
ocratic Party are treating this

"   Parties gearing up for 2010 elections

Part2: (GOP announces new “Pledge to America ”

Last Friday marked the dawn-
ing of a new political chapter in
the annals of the Republican Par-
ty as leading conservative mem-
bers of Congress met in a lum-
beryard of a Virginia suburb of
Washington to announce the new
“Pledge to America,” the new and

rity, summarized in the following
paragraphs.

Important points under the
section of economics include a
commitment to “permanently
stop any and all job-killing tax
hikes,” subsidize small business
growth by reducing business in-

way, Americans can be insured
more easily and at lower cost.
Reforms to government pro-
cesses shall include a 72-hour

page mega-bills speciﬁcally in
mind), a mandate that legislation

improved platform for the Grand
Old Party.

It is currently a fascinating
time to be involved or interest-
ed in politics, especially if you
are a conservative. The last two
years have been tumultuous and
demoralizing, with some of our
own hailing it as “the end of the
GOP.”

Of course, it has not helped
that there are no faces that Repub-
licans could hold as their standard
bearers except Glenn Beck, Rush
Limbaugh and Sarah Palin.

All we could do these past two
years was watch powerlessly as
the health care bill was ram-rod-
ded through the hallowed halls of
Congress. It was as if we were lost
in the woods with no breadcrumbs
to lead us out. But no more.

The former GOP juggernaut
has continued to pick up steam
lately, especially as projections
foreshadow a possible change of
power in Congress. Nowadays,
the once-dismayed and embar-
rassed constituents of the GOP
are re-energized for the coming
elections in November.

The legislative agenda an-
nounced for the Republican Party
was divided into ﬁve sections:

the economy, government ex-.

penditure, health care, govem-
ment reforms and national secu-

come taxes by 20 percent, stream-
lining government “red tape” and
undoing certain cumbersome and
“job-killing business mandates.”

One of these business man-
dates the GOP has pledged to
kill is a clause of the health care
bill that requires all businesses
to make a report to the IRS for
any income or expenditure in
excess of $600 (seriously, that’s
in there!). These are expected to
foster economic growth in these
difficult times. .

The major concern for gov-
ernment spending is a balanced
budget, to be created by capping
discretionary funds at a certain
level, a'cut in general spending
to pre-bailout levels, a request for
weekly votes on spending cuts, an
end to “TARP for once and for all”
and a hiring freeze for all federal
bureaucracy positions not dealing
immediately with security. All of
these measures should slim down
the government through natural
attrition.

For health care, essential points
made are the permanence of the
Hyde Amendment, ensuring no
federal money is applied to abor-
tion (which has to be reviewed
annually) and a motion to replace

- the health care bill with one spe-

ciﬁcally geared to legislate medi-
cal liability or tort reform. This

Democrats not quite sold on “Pledge to America”

Democrats do not believe that the new GOP plan will ensure a Republican November victory

By Summer Lollie
COLU M NIST

Last week, Republican lead-
ers revealed their “Pledge to
America,” a 21-page document
that outlines policy principles
that House Republicans pledge
, to follow.

The pledge was designed to
echo Newt Gingrich’s “Contract
with America,” which is widely
associated with the 12-year Re-
publican congressional majority
(shudder) that the country ex-
perienced before the 2006 elec-
tions.

Eerily similar, if not just a
photocopied version of Newt’s
“Contract,” the “Pledge” touches
' on many hot-button GOP issues:
make the Bush tax cuts perma-
nent for the top 2 percent, repeal

health care, institute hiring
freezes and cut spending—but
pledge to ﬁilly fund missile de-
fense programs.

Speaking about the pre-
amble to the GOP “Pledge,”
House Republican Leader John
Boehner admitted to America
that the GOP plan is much of
the same: “‘We are not going I
to be any different than we’ve
been.”

It seems as if, in the four
years that the Republicans have
lost control of Congress, their
soul-searching (remember the
website Americaspeakingout.
com?) to come up with fresh new
ideas returned fruitless.

Or maybe it was a conscious

decision to come out with fresh
new ideas that sound exactly
like their old ones. The same
old ideas that, as Speaker of the
House Nancy Pelosi put it “cost
us 8 million American jobs, dou-
bled our national debt, hurt mil-
lions of Americans and wrecked
our economy.”

Republicans sure do know
how to stick to their guns (ﬁgu-

spect them for that. I really do.
With more ﬁlibusters than
~in the history of Congress, Re-
publicans have obstructed and
destroyed important pieces of
legislation such as the repeal of
“Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” cam-
paign ﬁnance reform, unemploy-
ment beneﬁts and tax credits for

small business. They did this ‘

while weakening the Wall Street
reform bill, among a laundry list
of others.

It is predicted that the Demo-
crats will face a bloodbath come
November. This is a prediction
that makes me lose sleep at
night.

However, after reading the
Republican “Pledge to Ameri-
ca”, I was reminded of why I am
and always will be a Democrat.

As imperfect and disorga-
nized as Democrats may be, I
belong to a party that is open to
fresh ideas. I belong to a party
that wants to move forward to
something greater.

I’ve been called naive, too
hopeful or just plain stupid. But

writers include a clause demon-
strating the constitutionality of
the bill if passed and an effort to
prevent non-topical bills from be-
ing joined. ’

tional security to keep troop fund-
ing bills “clean,” in order to cut
down on pork barrel funding, that
Iran be sanctioned unless it abides
by the nuclear security constraints
that the UN negotiated earlier this
year and that all persons suspect
of terrorism be kept off of United
States soil.

The l 994 Contract With Amer-
ica was highly successful. Repub-
licans took 54 seats in the House,
gaining the ﬁrst GOP majority in
the House since Eisenhower was
president.

Of course, Speaker Pelosi has
already issued a most fervent
statement via e-mail against the
platform.

One thing is certain, though:

this upcoming election will be

one for the history books.

it is not I who will return the
keys to the party that drove us
into the ditch that we are in. It is
not I who will hand the mop over
to the ones who made the mess
in the ﬁrst place.

This is my pledge to Ameri-
ca: I will not let my myopia and
anger cloud my judgment about
which party is on the right side
of history.

Politics around the country: Bell tolls for CA city officials

Alarmingly high payments for city oﬁicials outside Los Angeles show massive corruption among civil service unions

By John Paul Beall
COLUM NIST

The arrests of eight civil ser-
vants brought justice to Bell, Ca-
lif. on Sept. 20. j

This working class, inner-city
town, within view from the Los
Angeles City Hall, had woken up
in July to ﬁnd that its top eight
top‘ city employees were taking
the highest salaries, beneﬁts and
pension plans in the state and the
nation.

City Manager Robeit Rizzo
accepted an exorbitant $787,637
annual salary and another
$712,000 in beneﬁts, collecting a
total of$ 1.5 million last year. His
salary was contracted to increase
every year by 12 percent, and
also to receive 156 vacation days '

per year as part of his contract.

Consider that congress-
men make $l74,000 annually,
the President makes $400,000
and most other California up-
per city employees make about
$200,000.

Other members of the City
Council and lower city employ-
ees were earning more than
$100,000 per year until taking a ‘
pay cut when the salaries came to
light. There were several instanc-
es when the city nearly erupted
in riots.

The enormous salaries of
Rizzo and seven other city em-
ployees were supported by three
known cases of illegal taxation

of citizens and businesses within
the city, found by state auditors
this past month, culminating in
the Attorney General’s ofﬁce
ﬁling a criminal lawsuit against
these eight employees arrested
on the 20th.

Those arrested include Rizzo,
former Assistant City Manager
Angela Spaccia; Councilmem-
bers Luis Artiga, Teresa Jacobo
and George Mirabal; Mayor Os-
car Hernandez; and former Coun-
cilmembers George Cole and
Victor Bello. Police had to use a
battering ram to break down the
mayor’s door.

The State Controller’s office
estimates that the citizens of Bell

and more than 1,000 area busi-
nesses were illegally taxed over
a sum of $5.6 million, charged
large sewer maintenance fees, a
“retirement tax” ($2.9 million,
to support pension plans) that
lacked sufﬁcient voter approval,
and an over-large property tax
rate, 1.55 percent of the assessed
value of their house, 34 percent
above the average. L.A. County
average is 1.16 percent, and Bev-
erly Hills, a city with four times
the per capita income of Bell,
pays 1.19 percent for its property
taxes.

Bell has the second highest
taxation rate in L.A. County. One
of the poorest towns in Calif, it

is also one of the worst hit areas
by the recession.

State Controller John Chiang
concludes that the tax levels were
too high to be legal, though Rob-
ert Rizzo shamelessly responded
to outrage over his $1.5 million
king’s ransom of a paycheck in
saying that, “If that’s a number 1
people choke on, maybe I’m in
the wrong business... I could go
into private business and make
that kind of money. This council
has compensated me for the job
I’ve done.” What a disconnect
certain parts of our government
have with respect to the private
sector!

In light of this, perhaps it is

time for Californians to consider
some serious civil service re-
form. I

Reform is needed especially
with respect to the civil service
unions, who wield a huge amount
of power within the state.

Still, all Americans, whether
or not their public employees are
cheating them, should consider
what happens when we are not
paying attention to our govem-
ment, and what a ,dear price we
pay for our ignorance.

Forget the stereotype; it 3 time that to grow up and start implementing Twitter into your daily session of Internet surﬁng

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

We spent decades in America
trying to minimize racial and
gender stereotypes around the
country. Nowadays, an i1l—ad-
vised joke or offhanded remark
can cause someone to lose a
friend or even ajob.

However, there are still ste-
reotypes that are used unabash-
edly all the time. People make
references without really know-
ing what they are talking about
or how people will take their hor-
ribly offensive comments. Yes,
Internet stereotypes are no joke.

I am tired of constantly hear-
ing people bash these harmless
websites simply because these
people want to believe the ig-
norant lies that are spread about
them. Craigslist is for serial kill-
ers. MySpace is for pedophiles
and people who genuinely enjoy
wearing black nail polish on a

daily basis. Men only use Google
Images for. . .uh. . .paintings from
the late Northem Renaissance.
We’ve heard all these miscon-
ceptions before, and while all of
them have some basis in fact, the
point and the way that these web-
sites are actually used completely
differs from the stereotype.
Today, Craigslist is used to
ﬁnd legitimate jobs and servic-
es, some of which actually pay
good money. Bands have used
MySpace for years, and there are
a good amount of musicians to-
day that would not be where they
are if it were not for MySpace.
As for Google Images, well, let’s
not cover that one right now.
This brings me to my most
hated Internet stereotype: Twit-

news feed of information that
you care about?

Is that really going to end up
being a drain on your life to the
point where you are embarrassed
to mention your association with
it?

I have had a Twitter account
since March 2009. Even now, it
feels like I’m tellingyou that l’ve
been interested in bestiality since
March 2009. I joined for two

reasons: I like sports, and I like
knowing more than other people.
Twitter has helped me out with
my two likes perfectly.

Before any news hits the In-
ternet or even television, it goes
to Twitter. Before analysis hits
the newsstands or even the rest
of the Internet, it goes to Twitter.
‘Therefore, when something you
care about happens in the world,
Twitter lets you be one of the
ﬁrst people to ﬁnd out. Plus, you
can be the ﬁrst one to know what
other people think about what
just happened.

Knowing other people’s
analysis can get you pretty far in
life. The majority of insightful
and funny things I say are solely
thanks to Twitter. l’ve tried be-
ing original, but in the end, those
jokes fall ﬂat and that insight
usually gets laughed at.

Only on Twitter can I have
Kenny Powers tell me “If you
think the Little Dick World Se-
ries means anything then you’re
probably a big fan of horoscopes,
too.” That little joke earned me
a chuckle or two at a lunch dur-
ing O-Week. Without Twitter, it
wouldn’t have been possible.

Besides jokes and meaning-
less sports stories, Twitter actual-

ly serves a role in news that mat-
ters. After Hurricane Gustav and
Ike hit the Gulf Coast in 2008,
gas prices in the Gulf soared,
and many gas stations in Atlanta
didn’t have any gas to sell. Gas
starved Atlanta natives turned to
the upstart Twitter to solve their
problem.

Whenever an Atlanta resident
would ﬁnd a working gas station
they would Tweet the location
and follow it with “#atlgas.” This
trending topic would let anyone
search Twitter for all mentions
of “#atlgas.” This story was
covered relentless by the media
when it ﬁrst happened, but situa-
tions like this happen all the time
on Twitter.

So, the ﬁnal question you
are probably asking yourself is,
“What would I Tweet about?”
Well, nothing actually.

That’s the best part about
Twitter. You don’t need to Tweet
to use it. Most people who use
Twitter are probably not that in-
teresting. I am one of them. So,
why would I need inﬂate my al-
ready monstrous ego and tell the
Internet something that nobody
will care about?

I really don’t need to, and
when you join Twitter (you’ll

get there eventually), you won’t
need to either. '

That’s really the point. In Au-
gust 2009, a research company
ﬁrm named Pear Analytics con-
cluded that only 4% of Tweets
on Twitter were news related.
Due to that low percentage, in
Nov. 2009, Twitter made a point
of focusing on making news a
priority. That prioritizing is now
starting to come to fruition and
almost every conceivable news
source now posts links and up-
dates on Twitter.

So now that you know how to
properly use Twitter? What’s the
problem with it?

The Ashton Kutcher’s and
Kim Kardashian’s of the world
still play a major role on the web-
site, but they are getting a less
and less share of the trafﬁc.

This medium for providing 1

quick updates, good links and
breaking headlines is currently
the hottest thing in media right
now.

Just try and explain to me why
this website is still deserving of
its negative stereotype. Well, ex-
plain in less than 140 characters.
You’re going to‘be abiding by
that limit more often.

Dating 10:]; a boy’s guide to first dates

Tired of watching them constantly screw up easy chances, Campbell Burr gives
guys some much-needed advice

By Campbell Burr
C0 LU MNIST

The home phone rang, wak-
ing me from my Saturday mom-
ing slumber. I leaned over and
looked at my clock, 10:01. Too
early. After lingering in bed for
another 30 minutes, I» headed
downstairs for some breakfast.

“Campbell!” my mom greet-
ed me as I entered the kitchen,
“Some boy, John Wilson, called
the home phone this morning. He
wants you to call him.” '

John Wilson??! No big deal,
I mean, I’d only had a huge
crush on him for a month, even
though we hardly knew each oth-
er. A huge smile formed across
my face. “What was he calling
about?” '

“I’m not sure. He seemed
sweet. He left his number.”

I hadn’t received a call on the
home line since middle school. I
decided not to get my hopes up;
it was probably school-related,
even though we were in none of
the same classes. Maybe he had
a question about student govem-
ment or needed a lift to school?
I was somewhat confused, but
after reciting, “Hi Mr./ Mrs. Wil-
son, this is Campbell Burr; is
John available?” and a casual,
“Hey John, what’s up?” a few
dozen times, I took the leap and
called the dream boy back.

Our conversation went sur-
prisingly well, minus the pause
between the exchange of “what’s

up’”s and the “I was wonder-

ing if you wanted to hang out at

some point this weekend.” I had
to take a breath. Hang out?? This
random boy who I had spent way
too many hours Facebook stalk-
ing wanted to go out with me?! I
took a breath and followed with
a nonchalant, “Yeah, sure That
would be fun.”

He suggested lunch in town,
which made me even happier and
a bit relieved. After all, “hang
out” to many boys means “movie
in dark basement when your par-
ents aren’t home.” I accepted, in-
sisting that we wait a bit because I
had “to ﬁnish something at home
ﬁrst.” I had over an hours worth
of hair straightening, wardrobe
grazing and Listerine gargling to
do.

We met at a casual sandwich
place in town. John and I didn’t
have that much to talk about. We
were in different friend circles,
played different sports and had
only talked to each other maybe
twice atrcrowded football games.

I stuck with the basic ques-
tions to keep the conversation
going: siblings, where he was
looking for college. (I had trou-
ble remembering that it was not
every juniorfs favorite topic...)
I may have even gone. as low
as talking about teachers and
classes, I was starting to hope my
phone would ring. John brought a
bottle of soda to the cash register.
“Aren’t you ordering?” I asked.

“Nope, ate at home.”

Perfect! 1 love people watch- I

ing me eat! Especially boys that
I’m trying to impress. How did
he know?

As if that wasn’t bad enough,
he left me to pay for my over-
dressed salad. Ouch.

We sat down. I was so preoc-
cupied with eating neatly that I
could hardly focus on the con-
versation. I crunched on crou-
tons while John’s eyes rotated
from my eyes to my chest to his
phone.

Halfway through my salad,
John slammed his empty Coke
bottle on the table and announced,
“Well, I have some stuff to do at
home, so I need to go.” Was this
boy out of his mind? Ask me to
lunch, don’t eat, then after ﬁfteen
minutes decide you have some-
thing to do. He was becoming
less attractive by the second.

I assumed that he was not in-
terested in me. Whatever, I could
cope with disappointment. But
as we were about to part ways,
he reached out and hugged me.
“Would you like to see a movie
tomorrow aftemoon?”

SEE A MOVIE?! No, I don’t
want to give up three hours of a
beautiful Sunday to sit in "a dark
movie theater and-... not make
out with you. I told him I was
busy.

Boys, listen up. First dates are
simple and should be fun. Here
are a few guidelines:

1. Call the girl. It projects
conﬁdence. If you want to show

more conﬁdence, call a girl you
hardly know on her home phone
early on a weekend morning.

2. Be appropriate. Pick a rea-
sonable movie that interests both
of you, nothing too violent or too
sexual. Also choose your car mu-
sic carefully. One boy had made
a special country CD just for our
date. It was adorable... until he
told me he had a funny song for
me to hear and proceeded to turn
on a vile, very offensive rap song.
Yeah... the boy didn’t even get a
good night kiss...

3. Eat. I’ve been on two
dates where the boy “isn’t hun-
gry.” Most girls don’t head out
to dates starving. Often, neither
person is hungry. So don’t leave
the girl to suffer on her own with
a plate full of random stuff she
ordered in the midst of panic
when she heard you weren’t
getting anything. Suggest split-
ting something. And don’t ever
take the “Well, if neither of us is
hungry, let’s just chill in my car”
route... It won’t end the way you

_ planned it to...

Lexington is ﬁlled with fun
restaurants and ice cream par-
lors. Boys, you don’t even have
to deal with parents or a home
phone. Use the gifts Washing-
ton and Lee has given you. Need

book.

Student spotlight: cheer co-captain

Junior Gillian Sacks embraces her leadership role on campus, rallying students, cheerleaders and the football team

By Holly Suthers
ARTS & LIFE EDITOR

Washington and Lee takes
pride in the many leadership
positions available to students.
While many take advantage of
these opportunities, the commu-
nity only knows of a few. Cam-
pus Activities and Recreation

provides a galore of opportunities
on and off campus, but the work
and effort that the student-lead-
ers of this organization give on a
weekly basis is often overlooked.
In order to spotlight the diligence
of these leaders, the Ring-tum

dents in these positions.

Junior Gillian Sacks, along
with Allison Ferrara, is one of the
current captains of W&L’s club
cheerleading team. Like most
students, she has mastered the art
of time-management and multi-

tasking. However, Sacks tact-
fully balances the “push and
pull” of her commitments with
efﬁciency and energy. Hailing
from Little Rock, Arkansas,
she began cheering at the age
of ten and hasn’t stopped en-
joying it since.’

Phi: How long have you
been involved in W&L cheer-
leading? '

Sacks: I began cheering

so 3 years now.

Phi: Why did you choose
to cheer at W&L?

Sacks: I hadn’t intended
on cheering once I got to col-
lege, but it had become such
an integral part of my life, I
couldn’t give it up yet.

Phi: What is your favorite
aspect of cheerleading?

Sacks: Even though I’ve

grown up a lot during the time
in which I started cheering, I re-
ally love the friendships and the
bonds created while being on the
squad. When I first started cheer-
leading, I was really excited
about being friends with girls I
wasn’t in the same class as. Now,

some of my best friends. I love
being able to spend so much time
with people I love.

Phi: What does being a cheer-
leader entail at W& L?

Sacks: Cheerleaders are sup-
posed to bring spirit to the fans
watching the game. Ifwe’re los-

ing, we try and keep morale up.
If we’re winning, we try to keep
it that way.

Phi: Is there anything about
the cheer team that you would
like the campus to know about?

Sacks: Cheerleading isn’t
easy. We work a lot harderthan

people may think. And it’s not
for everyone.

Phi: Why did you take on this
leadership role?

Sacks: I was elected by the
team to this position. I was more
than happy to take it. I had been
captain on my high school squad,

and am very glad that I am able to
bring what I know to the team.

Phi: What are you studying
at W&L? _

Sacks: I’m a Sociology and
Anthropology major, and WGS
minor.

Phi: What is your favorite as-

Jewelry sale bedazzles campus

Designer Katie Thompson shares "her pieces from ktcollection with the women (and men) of Washington and Lee

By Holly Suthers
ARTS 81 LIFE EDITOR

Washington and Lee students
take advantage of any opportuni-
ty to “swipe it home,” especially
when the product is as enticing
as the opportunity to pay out of
pocket. This past week, Katie
Thompson sold her handmade
jewelry on campus from her
business, ktcollection.

Students admired and pur-
chased the beautiful pieces for
two days in front of the Elrod
Commons. Thompson, "a native
of Lexington, also took the time
to get to know various customers
on campus. While she does not
usually show herjewelry on col-
lege campuses, she makes a spe-
cial effort to visit W&L.

“I only come to W&L be-
cause I grew up in Lexington,
my parents live in Lexington and
I always love an excuse to come
home. I also love working with
the University Store. They are re-
ally accommodating and so nice
to do business with,” Thompson
said.

The designer began making
jewelry at the age of 10, and even
sold her products to a local store.
However, Thompson did not be-
come serious about owning her
own business until her career in
the magazine industry inadver-
tently led her to create a career in
jewelry design. After moving to
New York City, she began mak-

ing jewelry for herself in order
to inexpensively add a sense of
ﬂair to her wardrobe. When more
and more people took notice of
her handmade designs, she and
her husband opened up a stand in
the East Village to sell her pieces
part time.

Her success encouraged her
to continue with her hobby, but
after leaving the magazine indus-
try and receiving her masters in
European politics, she said she
realized that her possible career
options were limiting to what she
wanted to focus on in life.

“I chose to stick with the jew-
elry as it offered a great lifestyle
for our family. My husband,

Zoubir, joined the business and
we haven’t stopped since. We
work really hard, but we love it
because we have flexibility in
our lives: we can usually pick
our two children up from school,
we get to dictate our own hours
and choose where and when we
want to work.”

Pieces from_ ktcollection have
been worn by Drew Barrymore,
Giselle Bundchen, Tori Spelling
and Amy Adams. Thompson said
that her designs are inspired by
the fashion world of New York
City and from the experiences
she has had while traveling the
world.

W&L alums Helen Coupe,

Paten Hughes and Jenna Wor-
sham currently work for her, and
enjoy it because it allows each of
them to pursue their own career
paths with a part-time job on the

* side.‘ They have also said that it

provides them with a sense of
family, which is not a common
sentiment to find in the city.

While Thompson’s visits are
meant for business, she is always
able to combine pleasure with
it through her interactions with
the W&L women. After this past
weeks successful visit, Thomp-
son hopes to return to campus
this spring.

“I really enjoy selling to
W&L women. They know what

they like. I find that they are pret-
ty adventurous in accessorizing
and that they have cosmopolitan
taste. Plus, they are just fun and
interesting women to talk to.”

 Field hockey mops up Marlins

The Generals win 6-2 over Virginia Wesleyan, clutching their ﬁrst win on the home turf after a loss to Hopkins

s TA F F w R I T E R

The Generals’ ﬁeld hockey team be-
gan their voyage to the ODAC tourna-
ment with a win over the Virginia Wes-
leyan Marlins on Saturday afternoon
6-2. Four Generals scored to secure their
ﬁrst home ﬁeld win.

“It feels great,” Coach Wendy Orri-

son said. “It’s setting the right tone for
the season. It was a great team effort.”
The battle began early in the ﬁrst
half, with the Generals not letting the
Marlins’ goalkeeper even catch her
breath after the warm-up.
“We were dominating and getting

a lot of shots,” said sophomore Emily
Kunkel. “We were playing really scrap-
py, and once we ﬁnally got it in [the
goal], we knew we could keep doing it.
It was a real conﬁdence boost.”

Kunkel began the scoring spree for
the Generals 20 minutes into the game.

The field hockey team dominated over Virginia Wesleyan on Saturday, scoring four goals in the first
half. The girls kept the Marlins on their toes, trying out new plays during the second half.

Sophomore Annie Stevenson followed
with a goal of her own just two minutes
later. Three minutes later, senior defend-
er Jennie Norcini scored her ﬁrst goal of
the season off of a penalty corner.

“I did feel very pressured, but I tried
not to think about it,” she said. “I don’t
practice them, so that way I don’t over-
think them during a game.”

Senior forward Kelly Tran scored
just before the break giving the Gener-
als a 4-0 lead at halftime. W&L had 23
shots in the ﬁrst half keeping Virginia
Wesleyan’s goalkeeper on her toes.

The scoring continued into the sec-
ond half with Stevenson’s second goal,
but the Marlins scored 52 minutes into
the game after converting a penalty
corner. “There were a couple of times
when our heads were down, but we got
them back up,” said ﬁrst-year defender
Riley Hampsch.

Tran scored her second goal of the
game off an assist from junior mid-
ﬁelder Christina Benedetti with fewer
than three minutes left in the game. The
Marlins’ game was not over though.
With fewer than 30 seconds left on the
clock, Virginia.Wesleyan was awarded
a penalty corner that wasn’t executed
until time expired. Three corners were
executed while time was expired before
the Marlins scored their second and ﬁ-
nal goal.

“We tried a lot of new things in the
second half, so tliat’s probably the rea-
son we didn‘t look as good, but it was
great to try them out,” said Norcini.

The defense played a really strong
game, allowing only ﬁve shots and four

penalty corners on the game—compared
to W&L’s 40 shots and 14 penalty cor-

ners. “Coach Alexander has been con-
stantly correcting us on getting a player
after shot and it’s really helped [us on
defense],” said Norcini. “We still need
to work on defensive comers though.”

. “After a tough loss against Hopkins
[on Sunday], this game was a great way
for the team to really come together and
prove to each other that we can do this,”
Kunkel said. “We’re on the right track
now and we aren’t going to give in until
we make it to the ﬁnals.”

Hampsch is currently the only ﬁrst-
year starting for the Generals and has
really made an impact on the defensive
end coming up with many interceptions
and two defensive saves on the season.

“I tell myself, ‘I better not screw up,’
because most of the time I’m the last line
of defense, and if I screw up, I’m the last
resort,” she said. “It’s terrifying, honest-
ly. I wasn’t expecting to play, so getting
playing time is kind ofa bonus.”

The Generals are looking forward
to the challenging games ahead in the
ODAC schedule, including next week-
end’s games against Sweet Briar (Friday
at 7 p.m.) and non-conference game
against Mary Washington (Sunday at 2
p.m.). “lt’s gonna be hard,” said Norcini.
“We deﬁnitely have the potential to have
home ﬁeld advantage up to the ﬁnals.”

EC meets
with student
organizations

Proposed plan would give
the EC more oversight

By Eleanor Kennedy
NEWS EDITOR

Washington and Lee’s Executive Committee is
developing a new program to better communicate

with student organizations in order to more efﬁ- V 3

ciently manage fund distribution.

According to EC Vice President Bill Larson, the
EC bylaws require the vice president to audit stu-
dent organizations. Until now, there has been no sys-
tem for doing so.

Larson, who has seen the budgeting issue from
the perspective of both organization leaders and the
EC, drafted a proposal for a system that would im-
prove the EC’s understanding of student organiza-
tions. '

Under Larson’s proposed plan, student organiza-
tions would update the EC on their activities at least

once a semester. Larson said his goal is to make the . ,

EC more aware of these organizations’ activities
throughout the year so that the budgeting process is
“easier and more fair.”

Larson also said that it is important to “make sure
student organizations are being responsible because
[their budget] is the student body’s money.”

EC President Scott Centorino said that he saw
the need for more structure in EC auditing when. he
served as vice president. Although he has not been
directly involved in Larson’s.development of the
new program, Centorino said, “I tliink—l1e’s done a
great job.”

Larson stressed that the proposal he came up with
was just a draft, and he wants to incorporate student
opinions. Last week, the EC held three meetings for
headsof student organizations to voice their opin-
ions on the new plan. Larson said 50 or 60 organi-
zation heads came to the meetings and had “really
good ideas.” A

“[ T he goal is to create] a structure
that encourages responsible use of

~ student funds... while maintaining
student liberty. ”

Scott Centorino, EC president .
 >

One of the students in attendance at last Tuesday’s
meeting was Tricia King, the head of W&L’s largest
student organization,: Mock Convention, . She said
she was “a little bit hesitant” at ﬁrst, because she
had heard a lot of students complain about increased
oversight. However, according to King, all of the
students at her meeting offered “constructive criti-
cism” and great ideas to improve the proposed plan.

For example, in Larson’s original draft, student
organizations are required to send a representative to
an EC business meeting once a semester. King said
that the students at her meeting suggested that the
updates could be done through e-mail to decrease
the burden on organizations.

Centorino said he understands students’ concerns
about increased bureaucracy. However, he said that

P p this program is “something that has needed to hap-

pen for a long time.” -
According to Centorino, the adninistration woul
have probably stepped in in the near future without
the implementation of some kind of structure. Since
W&L is a school that prides itself on self-gover-
nance, Centorino said administrative intervention
would certainly be even less advantageous than a

small amount of increased student oversight. “The ’

EC is deﬁnitely kinder than faculty oversight would
be,” said Centorino. ‘

Larson said that the administration is both “sup-
portive and excited” about the steps the EC is taking
to implement a structure. He also said he is going to
incorporate many of the ideas from the student meet-
ings into the ﬁnal proposal he brings before the EC

Both Larson and Centorino said it is important to
them that students are not overburdened by this new
program. Larson said that students should not expect
the new system to add any more than an additional
hour to the time they currently spend working for
their organization.

Accordirig to Centorino, the goal is to create “a
structure that encourages responsible use of students
funds... while maintaining student liberty.”

STAFF WRITER

After several months of work, the
ADPi Sorority House is well on its
way to completion.

The Theta Zeta chapter of Alpha
Delta Phi recruited its ﬁrst pledge
class in 2009, but had no house
where the sisters could live, come
together, eat and hold weekly chap-
ter meetings. Fortunately, the new
ADPi house is almost complete '
and will be ready for residents in
the fall of20ll. '

Project Manager Carole Bai-
ley said that the new house will
be LEED certiﬁed. LEED, which
stands for Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design, is a
certiﬁcation issued by the United
States Green Building Council,
USGBC. Bailey says that design
elements and construction efforts
to obtain Basic LEED Certiﬁcation
are the most signiﬁcant distinctions
that the house will have.

Some of these efforts are listed
below: '

struction debris will be diverted
from the landﬁll.

- 10% of the building ma-
terials will be from recycled con-
tent. _

- 10% of the building ma-
terials will.be manufactured re-
gionally. ‘

- Entire building systems
are designed for efﬁci_ent use of
water and electricity.

- The mechanical and
electrical systems will be commis-
sioned to. ensure correct installa-
tion and set up, therefore enabling ‘

- Window quantity and
placement is to maximize daylight.
Bailey said that “the University
was diligent in designing the ADPi
house in a very similar way to en-
sure parity with the existing houses.
Small changes that might be noticed
once the house is completed would
be due to knowledge gained from

main ﬂoor, and a chapter room on the
bottom ﬂoor.

One difference between the new
sorority house and the others is that
ADl_’i will not have a full kitchen,
but will be sharing with Kappa. This
is deliberate: a half-kitchen is more
environmentally friendly.

Cugliari said she is excited for

Young alums: coming home again

Recent alumni will return to campus this weekend for both Homecoming and Young Alumni weekend events

By Chelsea Stevenson

STAFF WRITER

Approximately 500 to 700
W&L alumni will grace the Gen-
erals with their presence this
Friday and Saturday for W&L’s
second annual Young Alumni
weekend.

The weekend’s events will
celebrate alums who have gradu-
ated within the last 15 years. Ac-
cording to Executive Director of
Alumni Affairs, Beau Dudley,
’74 ‘79L, each class will be rep-
resented.

On Friday, alumni will have
the opportunity to attend a pro-
gram hosted by W&L’s Johnson
Professor of Entrepreneurship
and‘Leadership,‘ Jeff Shay. At 4
p.m., Shay will discuss new en-
trepreneurship in Huntley Hall.
Alumni can also partake in a
campus tour and a reception at
the Lee House in honor of the

President’s Society.

On Friday night while the
class of 2005 celebrates their 5-
year reunion, the class of 2000
will be celebrating their 10-year
reunion. Each class will attend a
Welcome Reception and ‘cocktail
party at Wilson Field Plaza.

Dan Grattan, ’00, who is the
co-chair ofthe class of2000’s re-
union, said he is looking forward
to the reception because many of
his classmates haven’t been back
to visit and have yet to see Wil-
son ﬁeld. According to Grattan
this will be the first time that the
members of the class of 2000 will
be together without other W&L
alums. “We have never had the
chance to do something like this,
because at the last reunion there
was no speciﬁc space for just our
class,” said Grattan.

W&L is expecting nearly
100 members from the class of
2000 alone. “Class members will
come from all over the coun-
try, including Texas, California,
Florida and the upper Midwest,”
said Grattan. Gratten credited
co-chair Ginger Baker, ‘00, with
helping to bring this many alums
back for their reunion.

The co-chairs for the class"

of 2005’s reunion are Patrick
Hastings, ’05, and Emily Wolf-
ing Heinauer, ’05. According to
Beau Dudley, the class chairs
were chosen based on their dedi-
cation to W&L and how well
their classmates knew them.
The alumni and development of-
ﬁces also assisted in selecting the
class co-chairs.

Following the celebratory
reception, a band party featur-

ing 10 spot will take place for
alumni near the Ruins. 10 spot,
which was formed in 2001, is a
ﬁve-piece band that plays a va-
riety of music, from classic rock
and Motown hits to today’s top
hip-hop songs.

Saturday will feature many
events for the alumni’ ranging
from athletics to a bluegrass
barbecue. The day will begin
with something that last year’s
Young Alumni Weekend didn’t
offer: “Story Time for the Young
Ones.” At l0 a.m., a W&L facul-
ty member will read to children
of alumni in the library’s North-
en Auditorium.

Meanwhile, alumni can at-
tend the alumnae lacrosse game
on Alumni Field or take a tour of
Wilson Field. A lacrosse game
for male alums will take place at

4:30 p.m. on Wilson ﬁeld. Grat-
tan, who played on the men’s
varsity lacrosse team during his
time at W&L, said he is looking
forward to the alumni game.

W&L’s rugby team will also
play at home on October 9, on
Fuge Field. The l p.m. match
will be played against The Col-
lege of William and Mary.

The football team will kick
off at 1:30 p.m. against Emory
and Henry. Alumni will have
the opportunity to participate in
an athletic tailgate on the Law
School ﬁeld prior to the game.

After a day celebrating Gen-
erals spirit, alumni will gather
on the front lawn for a wine and
beer tasting and BBQ dinner with
bluegrass music. Due to the ex-
pected capacity of this weekend,
the location has been changed

from last year’s tasting, which
took place near the Ruins.

Dudley and the other staff
members of W&L’s Alumni Of-
ﬁce are excited for the upcoming
weekend and hope that it will be
just as successful as last year’s.
“It’s a pleasant surprise, when
you start something new, after
you’ve been doing something for
a while, and people come and ex-
perience exactly what you hope
for. We think that we’re starting
something that will catch on and
we hope that this group will re-
act the same way that last year’s
young alumni did.”

Celebrating Granvil George’s life

A memorial Friday afternoon offered the W&L community the chance to say a final goodbye to Granvil George

By Sam Gilleran
COPY EDlTOR

Dozens of students, faculty
and staff turned up in Wilson
Concert Hall Friday afternoon to
commemorate the life of Granvil
George, the Washington and Lee
senior who died ofgerm cell can-
cer on September 20, a few days
short of his 21st birthday.

Organized by his fellow stu-
dents and Dean Tammy Futrell,
the service was ofﬁciated by Rev.
Jon Talley of Reformed Univer-
sity Fellowship and Kevin Wat-

also in attendance.

Before the memorial service
began, clips of Granvil’s piano
recitals at W&L were projected.
Kevin Watkins opened the ser-
vice with a call to worship, fol-
lowed by a Scripture reading
from 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 by
Christian Roden, one of Gran-
vil’s freshman hallmates. Wat-
kins then gave a prayer, and those
assembled sang the hymn “On
Christ the "Solid Rock I Stand,”

Six community members, in-
cluding ﬁve students, eulogized
Granvil. They all spoke of his
humble nature, his academic bril-
liance, his competitive and ad-
venturous spirit, his love of food
and his deep Christian faith.

Granvil’s philosophy adviser,
Dr. James Mahon, also spoke
movingly about Granvil, as he
did at Granvil’s funeral in W. Va.
Mahon said that one of things
he would most miss -was the op-

the GRE and, while undergoing
treatment, had applied for fel-
lowships and proposed his senior
thesis.

After the eulogies, members
of the W&L Chamber Singers,
under the direction of Dr. Shane
Lynch, sang an arrangement
of “The King of Love” by Paul
Christiansen. The service then
came under the direction of Rev.
Talley. Talley gave a homily la-
menting the loss of Granvil, but

rial was one of the most difﬁcult
things to do as a minister, stating
in his homily that “there are no
classes in seminary for leading a
memorial service for a 20 year-
old.”

Dawn Watkins, Dean of Stu-
dents, came to the microphone
after the homily was concluded
and communicated a message
from Pres. Ruscio, who was out
of town and unable to attend Fri-
day’s memorial. She. also gave

tion from the book of Hebrews;
following the benediction, there
was a slide show of pictures of
Granvil, his family and friends.
Finally,’ Dean Futrell presented
Granvil’s parents with a framed
picture of Granvil, and the crowd
was dismissed to a reception in
the atrium of Wilson Hall.

The ﬁrst Fall Nabors Service

then the event has maintained its
strength and support. Holding
a Nabors Service Day early in
the year “helps to get everyone
involved,” said Kate Michelini;
one of the Special Project Chairs
for the NSL, “especially the

The volunteers were dis-
persed to various sites on and

I “My belief is that volunteer-
ism is kind of like a currency for
humanity,” said Nabors Special
Project Chair Joan Oguntimein.
She said that she considers com-
munity service to be a valuable
experience not just for those who
are being helped, but also for
those who are sacriﬁcing their
time and doing the helping.

According to Oguntimein,
the hope of the members of the
NSL is that students who volun-
teer on Nabors‘ Service Day will
make connections to the service
sites and will want to return to

Each person who sac-
riﬁced four hours of
his or her Saturday

reason for doing so.

Sophomore Juhi
Amin, the NSL Issue
Project Assistant and a

er, said that volunteer-
ing allows her to apply
what she learned in her
Poverty l0l classroom
to real life. '

Nabors Service
Day is not the only
event that the NSL or-
ganizesvthe Nabors
committee members
will be busy all year
working to get stu-
dents connected with
the Lexington commu-
nity through service.

Donnelly ex-
plained that NSL has
many events planned,
already, including a
Halloween carnival
for kids in Lexington,
-blood drives, a Spring —
Nabors ‘ Service Day
and Hunger and Homelessness
Week.

NSL serves as a liaison be-
tween students and organiza-
tions, ﬁnding placements for vol-
unteers in areas of interest, such
as working with children, work-
ing with the elderly or working
with the Campus Kitchen.

Oguntimein promises pro-
spective volunteers‘ that “to be
able to see your investment make
some returns is really a wonder-
ful feeling.”

Mark Zuckerburg and “The Social Network” can suck it

Furious at the F acebook founder is lack of character, Jon Salm gives the only negative review of “T he Social

Network ”

By Jonathan Salm
COLU M N I ST

A movie came out Friday
night that has been dubbed the
“ﬁrst truly great fact-based
movie of the 21st century” by
the New York Post, the “movie
of the year that also brilliantly
deﬁnes the decade” by Rolling
Stone and “brilliantly entertain-
ing and emotionally wrenching”
by the New Yorker.

What could a movie receiv-
ing such universal acclaim be the
topic of‘? Facebook, of course.

“The Social Network,” often
egregiously referred to as “the
Facebook movie,” comes with
an impressive Hollywood pedi-
gree.

Written by acclaimed screen-
writer Aaron Sorkin and pro-
duced by Academy Award win-
ners Scott Rundin (“No Country
for Old Men,” “There Will Be
Blood”) and David Fincher
(“Zodiac,” “The Curious Case of
Benjamin Button”), “The Social

First, the subject of the ﬁlm

be like making a biopic of Ryan

onto the social networking scene
in 2003 with an enigmatic cre-
ator, Tom, and a penchant for
both reliable social network-
ing as well as some incredibly
creepy users.

Despite the creepiness,
Myspace was a runaway success.
But now, Facebook boasts over
500 million users while Myspace
can only claim 66 million.

Sure, Facebook looks great

right now, but then again so did
Myspace circa 2005.

What’s to say in another ﬁve
years Facebook has been reduced
to a paltry 66 million users while
another social network takes its

place?
Not only will I boycott “The
Social Network” because of

Facebook’s relative infancy, but
I will also boycott it because
of its holier-than-thou, super-
douche of a creator and CEO,
Mark Zuckerberg.

Much controversy remains
surrounding Zuckerberg’s in-
volvement with HarvardConnec-
tion. com (now C onnectU. com).

Similar to Facebook, Har-
vardConnection was founded by
Harvard students as a Harvard-
exclusive social networking site.

Before the site’s launch, the
creators hired Zuckerberg as
a coder. After working on the
project for about two months,
the eventual Facebook founder
dropped their project to work on
his own.

That project became Face-
book, which quickly eclipsed the
former in both success and popu-
larity. D-bag move? I think so.

While early reviews of The
Social Network have noted the
Zuckerburg’s portrayal as an
anti-hero, it pales in comparison
to the opinion I (and likely many
others) have already formed.

An article from businessm-
sider.com last May leaked an
instant message conversation be-
tween Zuckerburg and a friend:

“Zuck: Yeah so if you ever
need info about anyone at Har-
vard

Zuck: Just ask.

Zuck: I have over 4,000
emails, pictures, addresses, SNS

[Redacted Friend’s Name]:
What? How’d you manage that
One?

Zuck: People just submitted
it.

Zuck: I don’t know why.

Zuck: They “trust me”

Zuck: Dumb f“‘**s.”

Even more messages, in-

cluding those about his work on
Harvard Connection, are just a
Google search away.

I am boycotting this ﬁlm on
premise—and not because of
poor quality (in fact, it seems
to be exceptionally good), but
because of the premise of Face-
book itself.

Quick recap: arrogant, Ivy-
league educated 19 year-old
goes on to become the world’s
youngest billionaire by steal-
ing ideas and then cashing in on
“his” success.

Perhaps this boycott stems
from jealousy, but I choose to
believe it comes from a purer
place. “The Social Network” is
out now.

It may be a good ﬁlm, per-
haps the best of the year, but I
guarantee that you won’t catch
me dead seeing it.

I am proud to say that I am a

down I-287 S to Bay Head, New
Jersey with my family.

We would visit my grand-
mother, who lived there for over
40 years, and have a grand ole’

I loved the boardwalk fries,
Caricatures, Ferris wheels and
the clear, crisp ocean water (okay,
maybe that last one is a stretch).
Then something happened...

Dec. 3, 2009, marks a monu-
mental day in my homeland’s
history, and I remember it like it
was yesterday.

It was a cold and dreary night,
with not a stir in the air. I turned
on my television to enjoy some

. late-night entertainment, and on

it came: the season premiere of

“The Jersey Shore.” It was ter-
rible.

Terribly amazing that is.
You know what they say—any
press is good press, and boy did
New Jersey get some press that
night. The show featured a man
calling himself ‘The Situation”;
how great is that? Really ﬂippin’

All about oral: how to get girls using words, not your body

Campbell Burr tells guys what proper and inproper diction to use when cajoling women into falling head over heels

By Campbell Burr
C0 LU M NIST

When I show my college
friends pictures of the most desir-
able boys from my high school,
some of them are surprised.
“He’s not that cute.” “Looks like
he’s 5!” “Ew bad haircut!”

I try to see the pictures from
their perspective and understand
what makes the boy seem unat-
tractive.

Searching for an explanation,
I look at his Facebook pictures
back through the awkward early
high school years...

Generally my friends are
right; the boy _ really isn’t that
cute. It’s his game that makes
him irresistible.

The ability to use words well
can make any boy attractive.

Here are some of the best and
worst lines that have been used
on me. You’re welcome to bor-
row, as long as you acknowledge
your source!

1. “I have a sister, so I un-
derstand your concern.”

Boys, this line is a winner.
There is nothing a girl wants
more than to be understood, and
there is nothing sexier than a guy

who is a good brother to his sis-
ter.

A boy I dated over the sum-
mer compared me to his sister.

“You dress like her, you enjoy
the same thing. You guys would
get along so well.”

When I would start to tell him
something, his jaw would drop,
“No, that’s so weird, you sound
like my sister.”

My heart would flutter so
much I had to lean over and kiss
him.

[Editor’s Note: The Ring-tum
Phi does not, for the most part,
promote incest.]

Guys with sisters have it easy.
For those who don’t have sisters,
try other lines.

2. “I don’t tell most girls
this, but....”.

Boys, don’t test this one. Even
though I may or may not have
fallen‘ for this line in the past, it’s
not original and most girls will
see right through it.

And, just a side note, if you
are trying to get with the sister of
a girl you’ve hooked up with in
the past, DO NOT use the same

lines...,especially not, “I don’t
tell this to most girls.” Sisters
talk, don’t blow your cover.

Another note: if you are two
brothers trying to get with two
sisters, do not share lines.

One boy said the sweetest
thing to my sister about how his
parents’ divorce forced him to
grow up. He used it to prove that
he was mature and would make a
dependable boyfriend.

It seemed so sincere I got
goose bumps when she shared it
with me — and then his brother
used the SAME line on me six
months later, adding that he was
especially responsible because
his older brother had “milked”
the divorce. Poor planning.

3. “I want you like a fat
boy wants cake.”

Yes this line has been used on
me. Pathetic. I wanted to scream,
“Do you mean ‘I love you like a
fat kid loves cake??’”

If you’re going to reference a
50 Cent song, don’t.

4. “Let’s just go by feel
and see what happens.”

This line might work if “go-

ing by feel" seemed even re-
motely like a good idea.

One thing boys seem to forget
is a little something called the
double standard.

Yes boys, you may not be
criticized for hooking up with 30
girls or eating 3 Big Macs, but if
I lived my life “going by feel”
I would probably weigh 300
pounds, have a couple of chil-
dren, a drug habit and a colorful
reputation.

5. Flattery works.

Anything along the lines of,
“You are so sexy,” “My friends
think you are so hot” or “You
have a banging body” will get
you far.

But don’t overdo it or the girl
may start feeling like she is too
good for you and ditch you for
the friend she knows likes her.

Beyond oral, don’t forget the
importance of carefully worded
texts.

Texting is a danger zone be-
cause, like your mom always
said, you can’t read “tone” off a
screen.

‘ An old boyfriend would send

me texts that I guess he thought
sounded cute, but actually sound-
ed feminine and emotional. For
example:

Me: “sweet dreams.”

The boyfriend: “I’ll dream
about you as long as you promise
to dream about me back :).”

It was especially annoying
because he didn’t realize how
obvious his motive was. Some
people just don’t know how to
use technology.

The truth is that lines are all
about delivery.

You can make a terrible line

The truth is that lines are all about delivery.

You can make a terrible line adorable with

a smile and alaugh acknowledging that you

sound like a huge tool.

And yes, he actually used the
smiley face.

Another error this boy made
was putting question marks at
the end of texts to ensure that I
would respond. This was a bad
choice because it always sound-
ed like he was giving me attitude.
For example:

“...make sense sorta?”

“. . .get it now?”

“. . .okay?”

adorable with a smile and a
laugh acknowledging that you
sound like a huge tool.

How else would I have ended
up making out with the boy who
wanted me like a fat boy wants
cake?

Oops! Good luck.

Republican party forges ahead in national elections

After two years of ineﬂective Democratic rule, the GOP looks to surge ahead this coming November

By John Paul Beall
STAFF WRITER

The last week of September
was marked by more signs that
the GOP is getting its mojo back,
as more and more polls indicate
that Republicans are closing in
on, if not leading their Demo-
cratic counterparts in both gov-
ernor and senator elections.

One exception to this trend
is the New York election, where
the Democratic candidates for
governor and senator, Rivers
Cuomo and Kirsten Gillibrand
respectively, lead their Repub-
lican opponents by over 10 per-

I cent. Outside the state of New

York, the GOP looks much more
comfortable.

It seems many of the Demo-
crats’ “safe haven” states are be-
ginning to shift toward the right,
with little to no ground move-
ment in the other direction.

The inﬂuential Democratic
Senator Russ Feingold of Wis-
consin is a good 12 percent be-
hind his Republican opponent
Ron Johnson, who is expected
to gain 54 percent of the vote.
Feingold’s lack of support shows
a striking lack of the coat—tail ef-
fect for the Obama administra-
tion.

California, the state often
hailed as one of the safest of the
Democratic Party’s strongholds

(besides “Senator Kennedy’s
Seat,” that is), is in danger of hav-
ing two Republican governors in
a row and losing one Democratic
senator, Barbara Boxer, to the
conservative Carly Fiorina, ex-
CEO of Hewlett-Packard.

Fiorina has been ‘essentially
tied with the incumbent Boxer,
ﬁghting over a seat that the
Democrats once believed to be
untouchable.

Meg Whitman, ex—CEO of
eBay, is running as the GOP’s
gubenatorial candidate against
former governor and current
Attorney General Jerry Brown,
who hopes to become both the
youngest and oldest governor in
California history. .

Whitman had been leading
Brown in the polls until recently,
when Democrats attempted to
tarnish the campaign’s reputa-
tion by claiming that Whitman
had knowingly hired an illegal
immigrant as a housekeeper.

To make their case, Demo-
crats brought in star chaser attor-
ney Gloria Allred to defend the
cleaning woman, who had pre-
sented a falsiﬁed Social Security
card and driver’s license to the
cleaning agency Whitman used
to hire her. .

The Nevada State Senate rac-

es are also neck-and-neck as Sen-
ate Majority Leader Harry Reid
pulls out all the stops to keep
from being ousted by Republi-
can Sharron Angle, who boasts

considerable support from the _

constitutionally literalist wing of

in campaign his numbers are ex-
pected to increase. In all likeli-
hood, splitting the Republican
vote will leave Coons with the
win.

In the high-profile Florida
elections, the governor seat is

won because of backlash to the Bush adminis-

tration, a base they took for granted, is begin-

ning to falter.

the GOP, the Tea Party.

The race is currently 48 to 47
percent in Reid’s favor. Reid is
the third inﬂuential Democratic
senator to come to crosshairs in
the polls.

Of course, we all saw the SNL
sketch lampooning the Repub-
lican candidate for Delaware’s
Senate seat, Christine O’Donnell,
for dabbling with witchcraft.

Nevertheless, she still sits
only nine points behind Demo-
crat Chris Coons. Republican
Mike Castle, a long—time Con-
gressman for Delaware who lost
the primary to O’Donnell, cur-
rently has 5 percent of the vote.

However, if he begins a write-

practically tied between Republi-
can and Democratic candidates.

The Florida senate election
draws particular attention as
Republican Marco Rubio con-
tinues to control the race with
a remarkable ll-point lead on
independent Charlie Crist and
20-point lead on Democrat Ken-
drick Meek.

Statistics are also starting to
work against the Democrats:
23 percent of Colorado citizens
count themselves believers in the
Tea Party Movement, and for the
second month in a row there is an
all—time low in citizens who con-
sider themselves Democrats.

On Oct. l, a Rasmussen Re-

port indicated that the Demo-
crats’ customary advantage
over Republican voter turnout
is dwindling. At this point two
years ago, 39 percent of Ameri-
cans counted themselves Demo-
crats compared to a Republican
33.4 percent.

Last year, Democrats counted
for 37.5 percent of Americans,
compared to the Republican 32.1
percent. This year, 34.6 percent
of Americans consider them-
selves Democrats, compared to a
Republican 33.1 percent.

If the trend of Democratic
voter apathy continues, Republi-
cans will reap the beneﬁts in the
mid-term elections. ’

The change in party alle-
giance is also a wake-up call to
the Democratic elites in OTTICC
that the general population is
growing tired of tax-and-spend
initiatives, such as the gargan-
tuan health care bill.

Projections predict that after
the elections, Democrats will
control 49 Senate seats, to the
GOP’s 47, leaving 4 non-affili-
ated.

The House of Representatives

_holds more dismal tidings for

Democrats. A Rasmussen poll
reports that 46 percent of respon-
dents who expect to vote this

November said that they would
sooner vote for the Republican in
their district; 40 percent said they
would vote for the Democrat.
Among independents, Repub-
licans hold a 14 percent lead over
Democrats. Independents are a
group on whom Democrats have

generally‘ counted to swing elec-

tions their way.

It appears that the reliable
power base the Democrats won
because of backlash to the Bush
administration is beginning to
falter.

So now it is time for Presi-
dent Obama to reassess his strat-
egy from resting on the liberal
order’s laurels to embracing the
general resurgence of conserva-
tism in America.

After all, we are overdue for
a one-term president. As a matter
of fact, the only time in presiden-
tial history that there have been
three two term Presidents in a
row was the reign of Jefferson,
Madison and Monroe.

With Obama posing to be-
come a lame duck in his ﬁrst
term, this does not bode well for
his Judgment Day in 2012.

It’s that time of the year again.
No—not rush or watching Ala-

regulation have brought the party

These attitudes have placed
the Tea Party at odds with both

Between conservative and liberal divisions in both major parties, a new party knocking out

entrenched incumbents across the nation, and the highly contentious and emotional issues of

healthcare, tax, and military policy at stake, this midterm season is going to be one of the most

signiﬁcant in recent history.

Taking its name from the
Boston Tea Party of 1773, the
modern Tea Party movement is
generally characterized as a po-
litically conservative populist
movement.

Loose organizations and lo-
cal chapters generally opposed
to larger levels of taxation, gov-
ernment spending and business

noying, I think they have made
the last two years of politics a lot
more fun to watch.

With antics like sending tea
bags to Washington and ﬂocking
to rather silly rallies with keynote
speakers such as political antago-
nist Glen Beck, the Tea Party has
certainly mixed up the traditional
two-party landscape.

grievances the party has raised.

While American history has
shown us that third parties rarely
manage to survive on any ma-
jor scale, it is not outside of the
realm of possibilities to imagine
the Tea Party gaining enough mo-
mentum to propel several of their
candidates to victory this fall.

Theﬁght between the GOP
and the Democrats is typically
pretty good, but this year, the
mudslinging will really not be
one to miss.

Battle lines have been drawn
for years. Since President Obama
took ofﬁce, the GOP has been
gearing up for this election sea-
son, fundraising like crazy and
attempting to attract candidates
who bring in voters from outside
the traditional conservative base.

The Obama wave that swept
the nation in 2008 brought in
many Democrats from tradition-
ally conservative districts. These
conservative Democrats, known
by many as “Blue Dogs,” are go-
ing to be hard-pressed to defend
the agenda the Obama adminis-
tration has put forth.

In particular, many of these
Blue Dogs will be susceptible to
attack on the grounds that they
do not really represent the true
political inclinations of their dis-
tricts.

Democratic congressmen

across America are being forced
to take one of two positions: ei-

him with harsh cries that those in
the Democratic base are “just sit-
ting on their hands,” and that “it
is inexcusable for any Democrat
or progressive right now to stand
on the sidelines in this midterm
election.”

Obama is giving us some
measure of the division with
which Democratic leadership is
struggling. Is this the best way to
raise a depressed base’s motiva-
tion in a tough election year? By
yelling at them?

I’m not sure that talking down
to your voters is the best way
to raise turnout, but what do I
know?

Between conservative and
liberal divisions in both major
parties; a new party knocking out
entrenched incumbents across
the nation; and the highly con-
tentious and emotional issues
of health care, tax and military
policy at stake, this midterm sea-
son is going to be one ofthe most
signiﬁcant in recent history.

With the potential to alter the
political landscape as much as
the I994 midterms, the stakes for
both parties couldn’t be higher.

This no-holds-barred brawl
between the exhausted and the
enraged will show the true colors
of both parties, and will make for
some excellent entertainment for
the rest of us.

Study Abroad Fair last Thursday encourages students to be global citizens across the globe

By Katie Boe
STAFF WRITER

Lastweek, Washington and
Lee sponsored the Study Abroad
Fair in an effort to showcase the
University’s own -international
education offerings, as well as
outside programs and compa-
nies. Twenty different booths
representing various organiza-
tions were displayed at the fair
where students had the opportu-
nity to browse, pick up brochures
and chat with representatives
from the study abroad outlets.
Representatives talked about
how to incorporate study abroad
with their curricula and offered
insight about the merits of inter-
national education.

The Study Abroad Fair fea-
tured opportunities to study
all over the world, which over
half of all W&L undergraduates

choose to do. One of the com-
panies, Intemational Education
of Students (IES), provides 80

, programs in 31 countries. Sea

Semester offers a unique expe-
rience living aboard a ship and
studying environmental science,
public policy and culture for a
semester while also awarding 17
credits from Boston University.
Each program provides mul-
tiple courses to satisfy a range of
major requirements, and many of
the companies are able to tailor a
set of courses to individual stu-
dents. Another company present
at the fair was the School for In-
ternational Training, which spe-
cializes in hands-on interaction
within the foreign community
and incorporates an extended
home-stay with educational ex-

periences, seminars and ﬁeld-
work for true immersion into the
foreign culture.

Whether a student is looking
for a home-stay, an internship,
an intensive language course or
ﬁeldwork, the Center for Intema-
tional Education at W&L can ac-
commodate the student internally
or ﬁnd the right program to sat-
isfy the student’s needs. For ex-
ample, W&L has partnered with
St. Andrew’s in Scotland to offer
pre-med students the chance to
study abroad while still fulﬁlling
all of the lab and science require-
ments.

There are some W&L require-
ments for study abroad, includ-
ing a cumulative GPA of at least
2.5, departmental permission for
coursework and country-appro-

priate foreign language ﬂuency,
but the university aims to assist
all students in planning a trip that
is conducive to their major and
their interests. W&L has devel-
oped many of its own trips and
programs to facilitate transfer-
ring credits and major require-
ments. Spring Term now offers
more study abroad courses, with
trips to Costa Rica, Tanzania,
Spain and China, among others.
The CIE can also place students
for fall term, winter term and
summer programs.

The CIE can also arrange
internships and work abroad
opportunities for students who
wish to do outside work in con-
junction with their studies. Some
of the more popular jobs held
abroad are teaching, professional

internships and volunteering.
Studying abroad is very im-

portant to the University’s ad-

ministration: it is implementing
a two-year strategic initiative to
ensure the development of new
programs. The University aims,
through the mission statement of
the CIE, to “create an elfective
global learning environment by
providing leadership, adminis-
trative oversight and broad sup-
port for international learning
and global engagement.”

The center also aims to help
students apply for university
grants, country-speciﬁc grants
and scholarships from outside
sources. Students who receive
Johnson Opportunity Grants are
able to use this scholarship to
plan summer trips abroad to work -

   Fair brings opportunities to travel the world

and study in a new environment.
Last summer, six W&L students
used their grants to travel and to
ﬁt their academic interests.

W&L’s study abroad offerings
are numerous, and the Center for
International Education can help
students to arrange the perfect
trip for each student.

“Cheese Louise” celebrates art collection

The Reeves Center hosted its biannual event honoring artist Louise Herreshoff Reeves

By Mary Helen Turnage
STAFF WRITER

Cheese, art and conversa-
tion were in abundance this past
Thursday evening at the Reeves
Center during the biannual event,
Cheese Louise. Since 2005, the
Reeves Center has held this affair
for students and faculty in order
to showcase the artwork of Lou-
ise Herreshoff Reeves. Though
the spring Cheese Louise has
been happening annually since
2005, this is only the second year
that there has been a fall event.

The spring Cheese Louise
offers wine, while the fall event
offers sparkling cider and other

nonalcoholic beverages. Katie
Gardner, curatorial assistant at
the Reeves Center, said the cen-
ter organized a fall version of
Cheese Louise so that everyone
at W&L, including those under
21, could enjoy the experience.
Many younger students know
nothing about the Reeves Center,
so this affair provides an excel-
lent opportunity for them to get
to know this educational center
for the arts that is right on cam-
pus.

According to Gardner, W&L
owns about 160 works of Lou-

ise Herreshoff Reeves. Born in,

I876, Reeves studied at the Aca-
démie Julian in Paris. She mar-
ried Euchlin Dalcho Reeves, a
1927 graduate of W&L Law. The
Reeves donated a remarkable
amount of Chinese l8th- and
19th-century porcelain as well as
many of Louise’s impressionist-
style paintings. Though she died
in 1967, her legacy lives on in
her artwork.

Along with the beautiful
paintings, guests enjoyed deli-
cious hors-d’oeuvres and des-
serts. The food included crab

tartlets, mushroom tartlets and
vegetables with Roquefort dip.
Also at the food table were all
sorts of cheese: buttermilk bleu
afﬁnée, MezzaLuna fontina,
Grand Cru Gruyere Reserve and
red spruce cheddar. Local apple
cider, orange pineapple punch
and ice water were provided
for beverages. And for dessert?
Cheesecake, of course!

The event had a great turnout
of students and professors who
conversed over Reeves’ paint-
ings.

“Cheese Louise was such an

eye-opening experience,” said
sophomore Camie Carlock. “It
was my ﬁrst time to attend the
reception, and I was blown away.
The food was delicious, and I
loved getting to mingle with
friends and professors in such a
sophisticated setting.”

Though the focus of the event
was on the art, many non-art
major students also enjoyed the
event.

Senior business and econom-
ic major Skip Wood said: “The
event was a nice change of pace
from the average grind of the

Williams School activities. The
food was great and I really en-
joyed the art exhibits.”

For more information on
Reeves, view her artwork dis-
played in the Reeves Center next
to Tucker Hall or attend the next
Cheese Louise this spring.

Gender inequality still a challenge in academia

Four regional professors participate in a public reading from their collection “Feminist Activism in Academia ”

By Collins Rice
STAFF WRITER

One wouldn’t expect a call
for gender equality in the aca-
demic sector to be revolutionary.
However, the tone of Monday’s

- reading of Feminist Activism in

Academia.‘ Essays on Person-

_al, Political, and Professional

Change was one that called at-
tention to the need for closer ex-
amination of the current state of
gender politics in academia.
Hosted by the colleetion’s
co-editor, Washington and Lee’s

Professor of Romance Lan-
guages Ellen Mayock, the event
included readings from four ‘of
the collection’s contributors:
Mayock’s co-editor and Profes-
sor of Romance Languages and
Chair of the Women and Gender
Studies, Domnica Radulescu,
Professor of Politics Robin LeB-
lanc and Hollins University’s
Vice-President of Academic Af-
fairs Jeanine Silveira Stewart.
The collection’s essays span a

range of subject matter, includ-
ing reproductive rights, moth-
ering language in the academic
workplace and gender-based
discrimination in classroom and
administrative settings.

In reading a selection from her
piece, “Get Out of My Uterus! A
Manifesto against Reproductive
Politics in the Academic World
and in the World at Large,” Rad-
ulescu drew upon her experiences
living in communist-era Romania

in order to illustrate the potential
violence of policies that regulate
women’s bodies. The fundamen-
tal right to choice and reproduc-
tive freedom, Radulescu asserts,
should not be a matter of public
discourse, but accepted for its
status as an inalienable right. In
her home country, 10,000 people
died as a result of draconic re-
productive laws, emboldening
Radlescu to echo the feminist
mantra, “I shouldn’t have to be
here,” indicating the obvious
danger of a totalitarian restric-
tion of reproductive rights.

In her selection, “Teaching .to
Spite Your Body,” LeBlanc re-
counted her struggle to be taken
seriously in an academic area
historically dominated by men.
As the only woman in the poli-
tics department, LeBlanc wrote,
she worked hard to seem less
feminine in order to gain respect
from both her fellow professors
and by her students. In addition,
LeBlanc stated the fact that fe-
male professors are sometimes
threatened simply because they
are women. At times in her ca-
reer, she confessed, this threat
encouraged her to disguise gen-
der differences in the same man-
ner against which she cautions
her students.

Stewart of University dis-
cussed discrimination against
mothers in professional settings
in a reading from her piece,
“Mothering out of Place: Decon-
structing the Maternal Wall in
Academia.” She illustrated the
underrepresentation of women
and mothers on the tenure track
at four-year universities, as well
was the differing effect parent-
hood has on the career trajecto-
ries of men and women. Although
men and women are almost
equally represented in graduate
schools, the same cannot be said
for professorship. Stewart also’
highlighted the disparity with
which parenthood is perceived
in considering those of different
genders for employment: while
mothers are popularly perceived
to lack the ability to perform at
the highest level professionally,
fathers are more employable in
academia than non-fathers.

Mayock closed the reading
with a selection from her piece,
“Mothering Language in the
Academic Workplace.” She ex-
pressed the importance of hav-
ing both accomplished men and
women in the “front ofﬁce” in
administration of academic in-
stitutions. The prevalence, she
says, of the terms “mom” and

 

“mommy” attached to other
terms~“Soccer mom,” “Ser-
geant mom,” “Hockey mom”——
gives the impression that women
do not belong in the workplace.
Such an idea, Mayock postu-
lated, ﬁirther perpetuates the
deeply ingrained ideas of moth-
ers’ capabilities. She encouraged
universities to be more aware of
language and its implications.

In regard to the Feminist Ac-
tivism in Academia, Jill Dolan,
Director of the Program in the
Study of Women and Gender
at Princeton University, wrote,
“This collection clariﬁes the vex-
ations of trying to be an ethical
professor, an honorable human
being and a woman, in a context
in which ‘female’ and ‘academic’
are too often oxymoronic.” The
book is available in the campus
bookstore and online for $55.

The Generals place 9th out of 3 6, leaving rival Bridgewater in the dust

By Teresa Soley
STAFF WRITER

The women’s cross country team trav-
elled to Lehigh University in Bethlehem,
Pa., on Saturday for the Paul Short Invita-
tional, a huge and highly competitive meet
thatover 4,000 college and high school
runners attended. The Generals ﬁnished
9th out 0f36 teams in their race, narrowly
beating out ODAC rival Bridgewater Col-
lege. Sophomore Lauren Schultz ﬁnished
ﬁrst for Washington and Lee in 36th over-
all with a time of24:02.

The excitement was high within the
team before the race. “I don’t think l’ve
been this nervous for a meet since high
school,” admitted sophomore Louisa

Phillips of Charleston, S.C. “The course

looks good though,” Phillips added. Only
ten members were selected from W&L’s
squad of 22 to attend this meet, known for
its high entry numbers and fast course.
Lehigh’s level, grassy course was heav-
ily affected by the previous week’s rain,
and parts of the course were turned into

wallows of ankle-deep mud. “It wasn’t too
terrible, but some of the corners were pret-
ty messy,” said team top-ﬁnisher Schultz
after the race. Before the race, sopho-
more Molly Ortiz of Ketchikan, Alaska,

‘predicted that the muddy course would
probably have a negative impact on times '

but would turn out to be “an advantage to
us as a team” since the team is known to
do “best in challenging conditions.” The
W&L home course is considered one of
the toughest in the ODAC, giving the team
the advantage of training on difﬁcult ter-
rain.

The muddy course still produced some
fast ﬁnishes. First-year Annelise Madi-
son of Roca, Neb., clocked an impressive
24:08. She was closely followed by senior
captain Katherine Fenwick of Berwyn,
Pa., in 24:28.

“I think it’s great we came to such a
competitive meet; there were over 400
teams here,” Fenwick commented post-

race. She was pleased that within the team
“everyone really pulled their weight and
really stepped it up.” The fast course and
cool weather were deﬁnitely positive fac-
tors, and the positive effects of several
weeks of tough training showed in the
W&L runners. After the race Fenwick not-
ed, “We all did a great job pushing, each
other; everyone ran a season best." All of
the W&_L runners were among the top 70
ﬁnishers of their 280-runner ﬁeld.

The team’s performance overall

was impressive in such a large group of *

schools. ‘‘I’m really excited. I think we
did a great job out there,” commented
Coach Kris Hoey. Hoey was particularly
impressed with the team members’ ability
to ﬁnd each other on the course and work
together. “Our top ﬁve all ﬁnished within
63 seconds of each other. That’s really in-
credible.” The Generals will race again on
October 16 at the Gettysburg Invitational.

Generals score big

W&L and Coach Miriello get record-setting win over Guilford, 55 - 29

By Jordy Stern
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee Generals out-
paced the Quakers of Guilford College
55-29 on Saturday, making history in the
process. Not only did the Generals score
the most points in a game since 1962, but
they also gave Coach Frank Miriello a
coaching milestone. With Saturday’s vic-
tory, Coach Miriello now holds the record
for most wins in W&L football history, a
mark held previously by Gary Fallon. The
emphatic 77th win of Coach Miriello’s
career showcased plenty of Generals’ of-
fensive ﬁrepower, with 545 total yards
compiled against Guilford.

Though the Quakers were ﬁrst on the
board with Tyler Hall’s 27-yard ﬁeld goal,

the Generals struck back on the next pos-
session as Brett Murray scored on a Char-
lie Westfal pass for W&L’s ﬁrst touch-
down of the game. Guilford running back
Mike Williams took the lead back in the
second quarter with a 23-yard touchdown
run. This would prove to be the last time
the Quakers had the privilege of leading
the Generals in Saturday’s game. Harri-
son Hudson brought the ball into the end
zone twice in the second quarter, reclaim-
ing W&L control of the scoreboard once
and for all.

Amplifying the ﬁrst half’s offensive
production, the Generals racked up ﬁve
second-half touchdowns, including three

unanswered in the third quarter. Despite
two scores put up the by the Quakers in
the fourth quarter, the Generals ended the
game with a comfortable 36-point margin
of victory. Individually, the Generals’ vic-
tory was propelled by several outstanding
performances. Murray led the offense with
three total touchdowns, two rushing and

one receiving. Luke Heinsohn surpassed

the century mark for the third consecutive
game, rushing for 223 yards, the most by
a W&L player since 2001. The Generals
and their high-powered offense return to
Wilson Field this Saturday to face Emo-
ry & Henry for the 2010 Homecoming

V game. '

‘L Healthy

minds

New student organizatition
promotes mental health

By Colleen Moore
STAFF WRITER

Catching a cold is almost inevitable in the fall or
winter, but most people know exactly how to treat
such a common illness. And yet, when it comes to
mental illness, few students know how to address
the related complications.

Fear of the words “depressed” or “bulimic” of-
ten prevents the education that will help a friend,
teammate or classmate suffering from a diagnosable
disease. Active Minds, a new organization at Wash-
ington and Lee, works to bring awareness to mental
health issues on campus and to lessen the stigma as-
sociated with them.

Active Minds was initiated last winter under the
direction of Dr. Christy Barongan, a clinical psy-
chologist in the W&L counseling center. Barongan
said she organized this student-led organization in
an effort to dispel myths surrounding Inental health.

Barongan said she hopes that ending the stigma
attached to mental illness will help students open
their eyes to prevalent issues on campus.

Acitve Minds President Lauren Ashley Tipton, is
ajunior pre-med student who plans to dedicate her
life to helping people affected by mental health is-
sues.

“People absolutely fascinate me, and I honestly
love, love, love to help them through listening and
just being a person they can count on to respect them
unconditionally,” Tipton said.

Tipton said she wants to provide the resources
necessary to help both students who are struggling,
as well as educate others to recognize a situation as
serious as a mental illness. Active Minds will orga-
nize and sponsor mental-health related panels and
speakers.

Members of the organization will also encour-
age balancing the programs with small gestures to
spread happiness. ,

Students who want to get involved in Active
Minds can contact Tipton or pick up an application
at one of their programs.

 mg flu outbreaks

Health Center oﬂers vaccines to ﬁght both swine ﬂu and normal strains

By Samuel Smith
STAFF WRITER

After multiple years of “swine
ﬂu” paranoia, the Health Center is
going above and beyond to prevent
another mass outbreak of swine ﬂu
on campus.

Every Wednesday from Oct. 6 to
Oct. 27, the Health Center is offer-
ing weekly “vaccine clinics.” The
vaccine itself is available at anytime
during the day, and no appointment
is required. '

Although the vaccine is not re-
quired of Health Center employees
nor work-study students, many of
those students and nurses have al-
ready taken precautions and have
been inoculated.

The 2009 HINI virus, or “swine
ﬂu," was a new and more powerful
strain of the seasonal inﬂuenza virus.
In response to HINI, the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services

‘issued a “nationwide public health

emergency declaration” on its web-
site on April 26, 2009. At ﬁrst, only
a few international travelers were
stricken by the new virus, but con-
tainment efforts failed. The virus
spread until the World Health Orga-
nization (WHO) declared it a “global
pandemic.”

The American media showed con-
stant coverage of the virus from the
ﬁrst conﬁrmed cases both worldwide

and nationwide, to the ﬁrst American
fatalities, to the closure of schools,
to the around-the-clock efforts of the
US. Government to ﬁnd a vaccine.

American schools were particu-
larly hard hit by the swine ﬂu, and
Washington and Lee University was
no exception. W&L had almost a
dozen conﬁrmed cases last spring.

According to an article in the
W&L archives, in May 2009 the
“Virginia Department of Health had
conﬁrmed ll cases of the HINI
inﬂuenza among patients” in the
Health Center.

Nurses likened the amount of
sickness to just another busy ﬂu sea-

son, and apart from the ferocity of
the HINI virus, didn’t see too much
different in it than the seasonal ﬂu.

First-year Allison Swagler chose
to get the ﬂu vaccine because she
doesn’t want to “get sick.” The swine
ﬂu outbreak didn’t really inﬂuence
her decision because she “always
gets [the ﬂu]”.

On the other hand, ﬁrst-year Eric
Notari chose to opt out of the ﬂu vac-
cine this year.

“I never get ﬂu shots. I’ll take my
chances with getting the ﬂu. I haven’t
had it yet, so I’m not going to change
it up this year,” said Notari.

Student athletes succeed

Two alumnae spoke about the lessons they learned as athletes at Washington and Lee

By Eleanor Kennedy
NEWS EDITOR ‘

Playing a sport in college teaches
skills which give student athletes an
advantage in post-graduate life, ac-
cording to two recent Washington
and Lee alumnae.

Dr. Kelley Zagol, ’05, and Emily
Wolﬁng Heinauer, ’05, both former
W&L student athletes, delivered this
message as part of a panel discus-
sion focusing on women at W&L on
Thursday, Oct. 7. The discussion is
one ofﬁve events to be held this year
in a series titled “Leadership, Gender
and Community at Washington and
Lee.”

Around 40 people, mostly student
athletes, attended Zagol and Heinau-
er’s discussion. The pair talked about
the lessons they learned from being
athletes while maintaining a rigorous
academic schedule.

“To be a student athlete, you have

to do both,” said Zagol.

Zagol, a former soccer player, is
currently enrolled in a residency pro-
gram at the University of Virginia.
She said that her time at W&L taught
her that if she worked hard, she could
accomplish anything, a lesson she
has carried into her professional life.

Heinauer, who works for a de-
fense contractor, said that her W&L
experience gave her the conﬁdence
she needs in her job, especially be-
cause she is the only person under
the age of 30 there and often the only
woman in the room. “Sports give
you that conﬁdence to stand up and
say, ‘I have something to bring to the
table,’” Heinauer said. ,

After talking about their experi-
ences both at W&L and after col-
lege, Heinauer and Zagol ﬁelded
questions from the audience. In an-

swer to questions about how they got
the jobs they have now, the young
women talked about the importance
of ﬁnding ajob that you enjoy doing
rather than focusing on having ev-
erything planned out right away.
“After college life isn’t linear
anymore,” said Zagol. “If you hate
yourjob, do something else.”
Heinauer said she found her cur-
rentjob through Colonnade Connec-
tions. Like many seniors, Heinauer
was not sure what she wanted to do
after college, but she was able to ﬁnd
a great job thanks to the university’s
support system. '
“You don’t' have to know what
you want to do -forever,” Heinauer
said. “But there are people at your
ﬁngertips who are willing to help
you.”
Heinauer said that her varied ex-

periences at W&L gave her the edge
over other ‘applicants when looking
for a job. She said the opportunity
to play sports, succeed as a student,
and participate in other activities like
Greek life makes W&L graduates
unique.

“Not only are you smart enough
to do whatever you want to do. . .but
you also have all these other things
going for you that other people
don’t,” said Heinauer.

Both young women had nothing
but praise for the education and ex-
perience they received at W&L. “You
are a better professional because you
went to W&L,” said Zagol.

The War on Noise and its effect on off campus parties at W&L

By shutting down most parties before 11:30, the Lexington Police Department is crippling the school ’s future

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

For some reason, I started—fol—
lowing the news around April
2007. I was in another country
and had just discovered pod-
casts, so it was nice to download
news videos that kept me up to
date with what I had been miss-
ing back home. Before then, I
hadn’t followed major national
news stories that intently, so
when “The McLaughlin. Group”
told me that there was a possible
housing crisis, I didn’t know

how big of a crisis that whole _

situation would become.

Around that time, the major
sentiment, at least in the media,
was thatthe housing market was
just at a down point in the cycle.
The only pundits delivering dark
and ominous messages were the
ones playing devil’s advocate;
they weren’t really taken seri-
ously.

The problem, like most major
economic problems developing

certainly has directly affected a
higher percentage of students. If
this problem goes unabated, this
school will be radically different
in the next few years. _
During this Homecoming
Weekend, just like every other
Homecoming Weekend, numer-
ous fraternities hosted parties
designed to rush freshmen and
entertain young alumni who
were returning to their alma ma-
ter for three days. The alcohol
and appetizers that were served
and the bands that were hired
all cost a fair amount of money,
and they served one purpose: to
keep the fraternity ﬁnancially
stable. Fraternities make money
from incoming freshmen pledges
and alumni donations. Everyone
knows that. But what everyone
might not realize is that these
fraternity parties are ultimately
investments designed to make
more money in the future. '

these werewolves of Lexington
is that’, quite simply, they shut
down parties. I’m not going to
bicker about the legality of shut-

.ting down parties before their

noise permits have expired. I’m
sure that’s already pretty well
covered (although, Law School,
did I ever tell you how nice you
look in that decrepit building
next to the football stadium?).

Instead, I’m going to talk
about the principle of the matter,
mostly because that’s how I can
best bullshit my case. By shutting
down these on-campus parties
with noise permits, the police are
depleting a part of Lexington’s
economy. I know LexPo prob-
ably doesn’t care for fraterni-
ties enjoying a proﬁt, but these
parties end up being a source of
income. So, yeah, you are cost-
ing legitimate businesses money.
Don’t know if that’s something
you really want to be doing.

never thought I would see the day
when it takes longer to download
a document in the library than for
the police to show up at the cab-
ins or polehouses. Houses have
been sound proofed and numbers
at parties have dwindled, yet the
police keep showing up.

This is around the time most
adults will tune out this article.
Having parents of my own, and
listening to my younger family
members complain about things,
I realize they have already shrunk
this article down to “Why won’t
the police let us have any fun?”
I get it. We are simply kids who
want to drink and break the law
without any repercussions. En-
joy the sports section, and I hope
your high horse doesn’t cause
you chafﬁng.

Now, for those of you still
reading, this is why the Lexing-
ton Police’s actions are wrong.
By the way, administration, I sin-

ing points as a university is that
our freshmen aren’t exposed
to the dangerous habit of binge
drinking in dorm rooms that has
plagued NESCAC schools for
years. Maybe LexPo is more
comfortable with unorganized
hall parties centered on shots
and pulls than pole parties with
kegs, but I’m certainly not. Also,
moving parties further and fur-
ther away from campus will all
but eliminate any of Traveller’s
positive effect. When kids can’t
use Traveller, they will resort to
drunk driving, and we all know
how that ended up.

I know there are proponents
of shutting down main sources
of alcohol to cut down on overly
drunken students, but I was lucky
enough to visit the Health Cen-
ter last Friday night. Let me tell
you, I’m pretty sure kids keep
drinking. If the War on Noise
becomes the success that LexPo

Ultimately, Washington and Lee is selling itself as a product, and for 18-year-old seniors in high school, part of that

product includes a social life. This active social life, coupled with an active academic life, is why most current students

chose to attend this school. Take the social life away, and we ’re a certain school in North Carolina without the Division

during that time, was acknowl-
edged but neither acted upon nor
given appropriate concern. Ob-
viously, we didn’t know it then,
but the country as a whole would
drastically change in the next
few years.

I started to think a lot about
those podcasts during Home-
coming Weekend. No, it wasn’t
because I was sitting at home
watching “The McLaughlin
Group.” However, I’m starting
to get the feeling that Washing-
ton and Lee may have a little
developing crisis of its own.
The crisis is not nearly as bad
as the housing collapse, but it

I don’t think that I’m throw-
ing any economists for a loop by
saying all of this, but let me get
to my point. The Lexington Po-
lice broke up at least two of these
bands before their noise permits
expired. Anyone who was at Sig-
ma Chi’s dance floor on Friday
or Red Square’s dance ﬂoor on
Saturday must have had a much
shorter weekend than expected.
By shutting down these two par-
ties and shutting down countless
others due to the new, very vague
noise violation policy is causing
problems. And these problems
are only going to get worse.

The second problem cre-
ated by NWA’s muse is a much
broader one that has happened
throughout the year. I have never
been a huge fan of Windfall, but
as of right now, it’s an integral
part of Washington and Lee’s
culture. Serving as the second act
of the majority of party nights,
Windfall parties have been the
day-to-day constant for a major-
ity of students during their W&L
careers over the last couple of
years.

Every night features a differ-
ent theme and ﬂavor, but those
parties always end up funneling
towards Windfall. Windfall is
where the plot development hap-
pens. Where the story reaches its
apex. Where the nostalgia origi-
nates. Regardless of your inter-
ests, spending your career avoid-
ing Windfall is like never taking
an elective in college or meeting
Burr Datz. It’s something you
have to experience at least once.

The Lexington Police appar-
ently seemed so enthralled with
the magic of Windfall that they
have decided to come visit be-
tween 11 and 11:30 p.m. every
chance they get. According to
the people who live there, Lex-
Po’s daily presence on Windfall
is BPing the nightly gulf of stu-
dents. How can there be Wind-
fall late night, if the nights end
before it gets late?

Windfall isn’t the only victim
in Lexington’s War on Noise. 1

cerely hope you are listening—
this affects you too.

All students who live off
campus realize that they neigh-
bor the same areas as families
and responsible adults who don’t
treat Wednesday evenings with
the same vigor. I’m all for mak-
ing sure that these families aren’t
disturbed by our fun. That’s why

noise violations exist, and that’s.

why we occasionally try to obey
them. However, by closing down
parties early, the Lexington Police
are forcing a very high number of
already drunk students, wired for
a sleepless night, to find a new
place to consume their liquor.
After this weekend, the were-
wolves made it abundantly clear
that partying at fraternity houses
is a no—go. A little side note: who
buys a house next to these giant
Greek monoliths without expect-
ing there to be some loud noise
at night? Lexington’s social edu-
cation must be lacking. Anyway,
these now drunk students are still
going to look for a place to party
after LexPo arrives, so what’s
going to happen? Either students
are going to start drinking earlier
and we’ll have people passed out
by the time Jeopardy airs or new
places will become popular.
These two places are either
going to be in the freshman
dorms or further out into the
country. Of these two places, I’m
not really sure that W&L wants
either of them. One of our sell-

hopes it will be, binge drinking
and drunk driving numbers will
increase. Have fun with that PR
nightmare, Ruscio.

The second problem cre-
ated by the vultures with sirens
is harder to decipher. Because
I’m a Democrat who still de-
fends Obama, I’ve had one idea
pounded in my head more times
than I care to say. In the end, it’s
all about the money. See, that’s
why I don’t hate the Lexington
Police Department. They are
wisely jumping on the cash cow
that is the W and L student. We
are walking disposable incomes,
and every parking ticket, speed-
ing ticket for the family and
drunk in public is just as much
of a money making venture as
is defending the public from the
evils of 18-21 year olds. I know
that I’m about to be called “the
spoiled little I‘*** who thinks he’s
entitled to everything,” but when
it comes down to it, us spoiled
little brats are either the most
dangerous people in Lexington,
or we help subsidize some qual-
ity dental coverage. Either way,
I’m not sure if I’m really com-
fortable with the situation.

This is not just the students’
problem either. Like the hous-
ing crisis, the War on Noise is
going to affect the entire W and
L community. The university
raises money through the year-
ly influx of new freshmen and
through alumni donations, which

actually resembles how the pros-
ecuted fraternities make money
(English majors, this is what
you call bringing it full circle).
After seeing some of the faces
of the young alumni members
this weekend, I think cancelling
bands before 11:30 p.m. worked
about as well in your favor as
paying Wale $36,000 for a one
hour set on a Thursday before
a day. of tests for many classes.
Plus, as the Lexington Police
shuts more and more houses
down earlier and earlier, word is
going to get out. ,
Ultimately, W and L is selling
itself as a product, and for 18-
year-old seniors in high school,
part of that product includes a
social life. This active social life,
coupled with an active academic
life, is why most current students
chose to attend this school. Take
the social life away, and we’re a
certain school in North Carolina
without the Division I basketball
team. Parents aren’t going to
want to send their kids to schools
where they know that they’ll
most likely have some meaning-
less mark on their record because
god forbid they had a beer on a
Saturday night. Future students
aren’t going to want to go to a
school where the curfew is 11:30
p.m. or where every party sud-
denly becomes a silent movie
after midnight. Donations will
dwindle, applications, will de-
crease, and before it knows what
happened, W and L will be star-

ing September 2008 right in the

face.

All of these negative conse-
quences are possible because the
biggest problem in Rockbridge
County right now is an excess of
noise. I would love to think that
I was horribly ignorant about the
real situation going on in Lex-
ington. I would also love if some
kind of peace agreement could
come between the warring par-
ties of the Lexington Police De-
partment and the students of W
and L. I think that, if students are
given select spots where they can
entertain themselves until at least
1 am, there really won’t be too
many more problems. I’m just
not sure ifthat will happen.

I feel like one of the dev-
il’s advocate pundits on “The
McLaughlin Group.” This will
be read by the students and cared
about, and the only action that
will be taken will be more ap-
peasing to our obviously base-
less complaints. Like I already
pointed out, the adults stopped
reading a long time ago. So with
that, I’ll end with two words for
LexPo. Well, I think Cee-Lo
already said it best on his new
single.

Rapper headlines GAB conce

Wale performs in front of hundreds of students last Thursday at the Pavilion

By Holly Suthers
surr wamzn

“Yeah they keep sayin’ whale,
but my name is Wale.”

This lyric was heard by hun-

dreds of students last Thursday
night at the Pavilion. The con-
cert, sponsored by the Generals
Activities Board, featured the
rapper Wale.
, Known for his songs
“Chillin”’ and “Pretty Girls,” the
‘rapper put on a successful per-
forrnance.

_ “It was really fun and the stu-
dents had a great time dancing to
his beats,” said senior Catharine
Gregorie.

Relatively new to the music
scene, Wale reached his highest
point of success in 2009 with the
release of his album Attention
Deficit. The album contains his
three singles “Pretty Girls featur-
ing Lady Gaga,” “Chillin” and
“World Tour.” The rapper stated
in an interview with Blues and
Soul that he chose the contro-
versial title in order to reﬂect the
various ideas that are expressed
in his lyrics.

Even though Wale is typically
considered a rapper, he has in-
corporated the newgenre Go-Go
Music into his songs. Go-Go mu-
sic is described as a raw, percus-
sion-driven genre that is similar
to disco. It originated in Wash-

ington D.C. and is still popular
in the area.

ties to the Virginia community,
too. After moving from Nigeria
to Washington D.C. at a young
age, the rapper continues to live
in the area. He also attended Vir-

played football. Members of his

Lexington says “Opal” to Niko’s

STAFF WRITER

Homestyle Greek food has
found its niche in the Lexington
dining experience.

Niko’s Grille.recently opened
at 167 South Main Street, the
previous location of McCoy’s
Deli and Pub. The restaurant
serves Greek and American food-
for breakfast, lunch, and din-
ner. It is open Tuesday through
Thursday from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.
and from Friday through Sunday
from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.

The menu has a wide variety

of Grecian specialties like Spana-
kopita, Mousaka, Biftkia, Lamb
Shish Kabob and of course, the
Gyro. The most populat menu
item is the Gyro Platter, which
consists of gyro meat on pita
bread served with French fries, a
Greek Salad, and tzatziki sauce.
Other popular items like ham-
burgers, spaghetti,
alfredo and a varietyof seafood
are also available for lunch and
dinner. 0

Fettuccine

The interior of the building is

spacious, but also creates a wan'n
family atmosphere. The walls
are lined with black-and-white
pictures of Lexington, creating a
local ambience. There is a wide
array of seating and has the ca-
pacity to easily host large private
functions. The menu is also fair-
ly priced and provides a quality
product.

My recent visit to Niko’s was
delightful to say the least. The
service was wonderful and the
food was delicious. Our wait-

ress was extremely attentive and
catered to every whim. After
speaking with other diners, the
high quality of the service was
agreed on by all.

The food was also as good as
the service. I ordered the Spana-
kopita, a Greek dish of spinach
and feta cheese baked in ﬁlo
dough, and received an extreme-
ly large portion. The entree also
came with a side Greek salad and
hummus and pita bread, all for
just $12.95. My friends ordered

the Gyro Platter, the Gyro, and
the Chicken Kabob and all said
that they thoroughly enjoyed
their meals, as well.

While I have not eaten break-
fast at Niko’s, l have spoken to
a few people who frequently
visit the downtown eatery in the
early morning because ofthe low
prices and variety of breakfast
plates.

As most students will admit,
it is easy to become tired of the
few restaurant options in the city.

However, Niko’s diverse menu
and long hours are a welcomed
attribute to Lexington.

As a local family business,
Niko’s Grill is a wonderful op-
tion for a casual dining experi-
ence that is close to campus.
Take-out is available for those
who are unable to take the time
to dine-in, but I strongly encour-
age the community to go in,
enjoy the ambience, talk to the
friendly waiters and havea deli-
cious meal.

Self-defense event comes to campus

Three Greek organizations bring TAKE to campus to teach self-defense to students

By Elenaor Kennedy
STAFF WRITER

After months of planning and
fundraising, TAKE Self—Defense
is coming to Washington and Lee
on Oct. 23 to teach young women
how to deal with dangerous situ-
ations. . ‘

TAKE, which stands for The
Ali Kemp Educational Founda-
tion, was founded in honor of
Ali Kemp, a sister of Pi Beta Phi
whose life was cut short between
her freshmen and sophomore
years of college.

Kemp’s parents founded TAKE
to prevent tragedies like this from
happening to anyone else. Since it
was founded in'2005, over 20,000
women ages 12 and older have
been trained. The class is free,
and participants also receive a
handbook with more useful self-
defense tips.

Senior Christina Torres, Pi
Phi’s vice president of event plan-
ning, spearheaded the effort to
bring TAKE to W&L.

In order to bring TAKE here,

   

Di

Torres submitted a bid with an
explanation of how TAKE would
beneﬁt our campus and commit-
ted to raise the necessary funds.
TAKE costs every campus it visits
over $2000.

Two other Greek organizations .

on campus, Alpha Delta Pi and

Sigma Phi Epsilon, are helping Pi _

Phi with this massive undertaking.
Together the three organizations
are working to raise the money in
a number of diverse ways. T-shirts
will be sold in the weeks leading
up to the class, and local restau-
rants are hosting nights where all
proceeds go to support TAKE.

During Parents’ Weekend par-
ents can pick up a tasty treat from
their kids and support a good
cause at the same time as part of a
cookie sale to raise money.

Although TAKE is just a one
day event, Christina said she sees
the event as a good ﬁrst step for
women on campus. “Knowledge
is power,” she said.

. Volleyball sweeps Sweet Briar

Vixens helpless against W&L teamwork and unity; a team total of 3 6 kills powers the women to victory

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF wmrzn

The women of the Washington and
Lee volleyball team dominated in their
3-0 victory over Sweet Briar College on
Wednesday night.

The Generals won the ﬁrst set 25-8,
the second 25-9, and the third 25-10 as
the Generals improved to 13-2 for the
season.

Teamwork and unity were evident af-
ter every play throughout the match. Af-

ter every point that they scored, the spir-
ited W&L players huddled together in
the middle ofthe court to yell, cheer and
sometimes even dance together, much to
the delight of the fans who came to sup-
port the team.

“Oh my gosh, I love when they do
that little dance,” said one clearly enter-
tained spectator.

' The players on the sidelines were

equally enthusiastic, making sure to
high ﬁve every player that subbed out of
the game as she returned to the bench.

Although the match was not the most
competitive the Generals have played
this year, they never lost their focus or
allowed their play to get sloppy.

“We did really well playing our own
game and keeping our own pace,” said
sophomore Taylor Maxey of her team’s

performance on the court.
‘ In contrast to the noticeable unity on

. the blue and white side of the court, the

Sweet Briar team seemed to be plagued
by a lack of communication. More
than once, multiple Sweet Briar players
made a move towards the ball before si-
multaneously backing away as it hit the
ground, each player expecting the others
to get the ball. Toward the end of the

second set, the frustration was visible on
the faces of the Sweet Briar players.

While many W&L players perfonned
solidly, two freshmen outside hitters had
a notably strong showing. M.A. Boles
ﬁnished the game with 11 kills, and Al-
lison Rouse was right behind her with
10.

Women’s soccer downs Hollins 4-O  

The Generals extend their winning streak to three games following Wednesday is victory over a conference rival

By Barbara Knipp
smrr warren

This past Wednesday, Oct. 6, the
Generals Women’s Soccer team defeat-
ed Hollins in an aftemoon game at their
home ﬁeld. Clearly the faster and more
athletic team, the Generals dominated
both halves of the game. They were the
ﬁrst to every ball, which ensured that
they maintained possession. Junior de-
fender Page Minton explained that this
is a skill that they “try to engrain from
the beginning of the season because be-
ing ﬁrst to balls spurs offense.”

With more than ten shots on goal in-

each half and close to thirty the entire
game, the Generals kept their opponents

‘ '35.?‘ i-"!21)“I.,‘@W.‘A‘{‘B9'l%"!‘,'X}'tdK?1$.T‘T'%l!.'v. 3‘

defense constantly on their toes. On
the other hand, if a green Hollins jersey
managed to approach the Washington
and Lee goalie, General’s defense suc-
ceeded in clearing the ball each time.
Minton, the General’s sweeper, stood as
the last line of defense against Hollins’s
offense. She ensured that no one entered
the box, making the game fairly boring
for the goalies.

Throughout the entire game, the Gen-
erals showed unparalleled communica-
tion skills. One could hear shouts of en-
couragement and instruction non-stop,
especially from senior captain Caroline

ended the day with an assist on a goal.

Lamberti. Minton commented, “Com-
munication has been one of the areas
that has been up and down this season,
and I think that we were playing a new
formation... We knew that communica-
tion was key to understanding the new
formation and being prepared to play
it against Lynchburg." Thanks to solid
hustle and communication, the Generals
succeeded in scoring three goals before
halftime. Two of the goals were scored
with only a fewminutes left in the half
by senior Taylor Garrett.

They were more offensive and always
ﬁrst to the ball in the first half, but in the

\

second half the ball was in the middle
ofthe ﬁeld more often. Minton explains
that it was because “games like that are
tough because they pack a lot of people
in the box, and we aren’t scoring.” The
home team proceeded to take a shot on
the Hollins goalie before a whistle was
blown in the second half. There was less
scoring in the second half, however they
continued to take multiple shots. Hollins
was denied a single shot on goal.
Fitness is one of the team’s strengths,
and the Generals look forward to a prom-
ising season. Two freshmen joined the
team, and have seen time on the ﬁeld,

adding “depth,” as Minton described.
After this week the team is focusing
on getting accustomed to the new for-
mation and strengthening the on-ﬁeld
support system. Team cohesion on and
off the ﬁeld continues to be a main com-
ponent to the successof the women’s
soccer team. The team looks forward
to improving upon their new formation
and is ready to face future opponents.

The Washington and Lee football team
put on an exciting and dominating show
Saturday, beating conference-rival Emory
& Henry College 45-24 in front of an ap-
preciative Homecoming crowd.

For the third consecutive week, sopho—.

more running back Luke Heinsolm rushed

 

      

W&L gave up an early touchdown
to the Wasps in the 1st quarter and still
trailed 7-3 by the start of the 2nd quar-
ter. That was until Murray had a 52-yard
touchdown run just over 2 minutes into
the 2nd. That was followed by two more
General touchdowns.

The defense also had an outstanding
day. E&H boasts a 1st Team All-American
running back on their team. W&L held
him to only 69 yards on Saturday, well be-
low his 145 yards per game average prior
to Saturday.

more running back, Brett Murray. also
broke the century mark.

As a team, the Generals rushed for 425

where they have accumula_tcd over 400
rushing yards.

   

Junior ‘quarterback Charlie Westfal
found first-year tight end Alex Evans on
a 6-yard pass for a score that ended an 86-
yard drive.

Sophomore defensive back Jake Pelton
intercepted E&H, in the end zone on the
ensuing drive, and the Generals capped
the resulting possession with an 8-yard
touchdown run by Westfal to ﬁnish out the
half. W&L went into the ‘half with a 24-7
lead as junior place kicker connected on
each of his extra-point attempts.

Just over two minutes into the third
quarter Westfal found Murray again‘ for a
17-yard touchdown pass to add to the al-
ready impressive lead.

The Wasps managed to put up 10 points
in the third quarter, but the Generals an-
swered with two more touchdowns in the

‘ fourth quarter to put the game out of reach

for Emory & Henry. The ﬁrst was a l-yard
run by Heinsohn, and the second a 6-yard
by Murray. '

lead the team with 10 tackles, and sopho-
more defensiveback Jake Pelton added
eight stops, along with two pass breakups
and one interception. The team also forced
and recovered two fumbles.

Senior captain and defensive lineman
Colin Campbell summed up the game say-
ing, “It was a big win...having the crowd
and alumni here deﬁnitely added to the
motivation to win.” Still reeling from the
excitement of the game, Campbell added,
“I can’t say enough about the offense and
defense today. They were great.”

The Generals improved to 3-2 on the
season and 2-0 in conference play. Wash-
ington and Lee plays again Saturday as
24th-ranked Randolph-Macon comes to
Lexington for a l:00 pm contest.

New Career Services
program helps studentsﬁnd
valuable internships

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

Career Services is launching a new program
aimed at helping Washington and Lee students ob-
tain internships.

Junior Mac Davis created the program, which is
called the W&L Internship and Opportunity Initia-
tive.

The program’s goal is to help students expedite
the often tedious and time-consuming internship
search process. According to the W&L website, Da-
vis said that he “applied for 20 internships and spent
100 hours ﬁlling out applications, writing essays,
prepping for interviews and being interviewed.”

Students and staff of Career Services involved
with the launch of the Internship and Opportunity
Initiative program are contacting alumni in order to
locate a wide variety of available internships in sev-
eral different locations.

Seven major cities have been targeted for the
first year’s search: Atlanta, Ga., Birmingham, Ala.,
Boston, Mass., Charlotte, N.C., Washington, D.C.,
Louisville, Ky. and Richmond, Va.

Juniors Jayna Johns and Stephen Wilson said
they both see the value of the internship rogram.

Johns, a mass communications major, spent the
past summer working at WSET, the ABC affiliate
in Lynchburg. Johns discovered this opportunity to
work at the TV station by searching online.

Johns earned one credit from her summer’s work
and still needs two more credits to fulﬁll her degree
requirements. These credits must be ﬁlled during
this coming summer.

Johns is hoping for “something big” for this up-
coming summer. She has compiled a list of heavy-
hitters in the news and entertainment industries that
she would like to intern for this summer. Fox News
and ESPN are at the top ofthe list.

Johns said she equates her search for an intern-
ship at a big-name company to a college search in
the sense that she is applying “to the Ivy Leagues”
now. '

Wilson, a double major in politics and studio art,
said he is also hoping to land a bigger and better in-
ternship, after spending this past summer interning

with the program “Life Pieces to Masterpieces” in

Washington, D.C. .

Wilson took Poverty 101 as a freshman and was
able to ﬁnd this internship by using resources avail-
able through the Shepherd Poverty Program. He said
that he talked with Professor Harlan Beckley about
people who had interned with various programs in
the past, and ultimately decided that “Life Pieces to
Masterpieces” would be the best ﬁt.

Wilson said that word-of-mouth from fellow stu-
dents and advice from professors are two necessary
components of the intemship-hunting process.

The ﬂedgling Internship Opportunity Initiative
program adds another possible resource.

According to an article in the Wall Street Jour-
nal, the demand for internship placement programs
has increased from 15 percent last year to 25 per-
cent. The same article also said that more and more
parents are paying to help their child’s chances of
landing an unpaid internship. Some parents are even
going so far as to hire “marketing consultants to cre-
ate direct-mail campaigns promoting their children’s
workplace potential,” while others are bidding for
internships for their children in online auctions.

As internships become increasingly competitive,
W&L students have many opportunities to improve
their chances of obtaining a valuable position. Ca-
reer Services holds “Quick Questions” walk-in hours
every Monday and Friday. The lntemship Oppor-
tunity Initiative program will be updating students
about new positions throughout the year.

Students interested in ﬁnding out more about the
W&L lntemship Opportunity Initiative program can
read the official news release about the program on-
line at wlu.edu/x51050.xml.

ofthe building. It was built in I882
with money from a $20,000 gift in
honor of Warren Newcomb. New-
comb Hall ﬁrst served as the library

 

and then as the commerce school
before housing the departments of
history, philosophy, religion and so-
ciology. The building was last refur-
bished in 1936.

While preserving the histori-
cal authenticity of the building, the
renovation also incorporated modern
updates. Elevators, a women’s rest-
room, 30-inch monitors, improved
plumping and new technology were
added.

The restoration earned the Award

vation from the Virginia Society of
the American Institute of Architects.

Strengthening the General’s Army  

A new contest sponsored by the bookstore attempts to create more support for Washington and Lee is athletes

By Hannah Esqueda
sun warren

This year’s General’s Army
shirts mark the beginning of
what many hope becomes a new
tradition for Washington and Lee
sports. The Athletics Department
and the University Store are
working together to sell and pro-
moteithese T-shirts as part of a
contest that encourages students
to attend more home games-.

“We want to promote some
sort of school spirit and get stu-
dents enthused about events” said
KC Schaefer, Assistant Direc-
tor of the University Store. “We
have a high participation rate of
varsity sports but we don’t have
a rabid fan base.”

Students participating in
the contest can buy a General’s
Army shirt from the store, and
then wear the shirt to any home
game. Each time they attend a
W&L sporting event they can
enter into a rafﬂe for a chance
to win one of several prizes. Ac-
cording to Schaefer, the raffle
ends in the spring after the last
W&L regular season so that “all
the sports teams will be treated
equally.”

Several members of the Ath-
letic Department came up with

the idea for the contest after no-
ticing that many big universities

who have large turnouts of fans
have similar promotions. This

past summer, Director of Athlet-
ics Jan Hathom and Sports infor-

The University Store is selling General’s Army T-shirts to

grow grow a fan base for
varsity athletics. Students who wear the shirts to sporting events throughout the

year can enter raffles and win prizes.

mation Director Brian Laubscher
approached the store staff about
bringing that tradition to W&L.
Together they worked out a de-
sign and slogan that they thought

themselves more to the gymna-
sium environment.

The store plans to continue
promoting the contest all year to
encourage students to support all

“We have a high participation rate of varsity

sports but we don ’t have a rabid fan base. ”

KC Schaefer, University Store

would appeal to students.

Schaefer said that he would
like to see the shirts every year in
a show of school spirit, but said
he realizes that they ﬁrst have to
see how this year’s contest goes.
So far, he is not sure how much
things have changed.

Schaefer mentions the “W&L
culture” as being a possible rea-
son the shirts have not been pop-
ular at football games yet. “Peo-
ple get dressed up for the football
games. There is something very
preppy about them.”

Still, nearly 200 shirts have
already been sold, and the store
expects that number to pick up
more once winter sports like bas-
ketball begin. Schaefer said that
the General’s Anny shirts lend

the W&L sports teams, big and
small. To make promotion easier,
the store now has its own Face-
book and Twitter accounts. The
accounts were activated on Oct.
21, and Schaefer said they plan
to use the social media to notify
students about new products and
promotions. They will also re-
mind students to wear their Gen-
eral’s Army shirts to each home
game.

Even though the contest is
targeted to students, Schaefer
says some parents and Lexington
locals have bought shirts. Since
the promotion is meant to get as
many people possible excited
about the Generals he said “the
contest is open to everyone.”

Coeducation and women leaders

Princeton professor Jill Dolan spoke last week about the process of co-education and women in leadership

‘By Paige Gance
STAFF wruren

Jill Dolan, professor of Eng-
lish and Theater at Princeton,
gave a talk last Monday focus-
ing on women and leadership,
both on the college campus and
in society.

Dolan’s talk, titled “Feminists
in Charge: Women Performing
Leadership,” was part of the
Johnson Lecture Series. Panhel-
lenic Council and Career Servic-
es have also both brought speak-
ers on women and leadership to
campus this semester in honor_of
a quarter century of co-education
at Washington and Lee.

“Sexism continues to plague
American culture,” said Dolan in
introduction to her speech on co-
education, activism and the cur-

rent status of women and gender
studies.

Dolan discussed both the
progress institutions like Princ-
eton and W&L have made since
admitting women and the work
that still needs to be done to
reach gender equality.

Before Princeton went fully
coeducational in 1969, Dolan
said that administrators worried
alumni would stop giving to
the university or male students
would stop applying.

Now, however, Dolan said,
it seems now that there have al-
ways been female students on
co-ed campuses. “Change gets
naturalized very quickly,” she
said.

Dolan continued to say that
this normalization can cause
people to forget the struggle
necessary for this change to oc-
cur. “It required myth-busting
facts,” said Dolan, and the “yield
of many years of activist agita-
tion.”

W&L professor Domnica
Radulescu helped bring Dolan
to this campus in the hopes that
her visit “would serve as a cata-
lyst for faculty and students to
engage more actively in campus
activism, to be proactive about
enhancing women’s leadership
on our campus.” A

Radulescu said she thinks
various courses in the women
and gender studies minor can

help improve discussion of these
issues at W&L.

“I think as per Dolan’s sug-
gestions, making the issues vis-
ible and having continued con-
versations about them,” would
increase “student’s sense of re-
sponsibility towards the campus
they love,” said Radulescu.

Radulescu also cited the “sex-
ist practices of the Greek organi-
zations,” as a source of gender
inequality. Dolan likened these
organizations to the eating clubs
at Princeton, which serve as the
main social outlet for students.

She used an eating club par-
ty invitation as an example of
the “bombardment of images”
that make up a negative “visual

diet” for college women. The in-
vitation was for a party themed
“CEO’s and Oﬂice Hoes” [sic],
and Dolan discussed the differ-
ence between the portrayal of
men as powerful and women as
objects. .

in another anecdote, Dolan
recalled how a ﬁrst-year girl
said some of the behavior by up-
perclassmen males was “preda-
tory.”

“Freshmen girls are particu-
larly vulnerable to sexual harass-
ment,” said Dolan.

At W&L, clubs like KEWL
and End It work to decrease the
high rates of sexual assault. The
Gender Studies Advisory Board
also works to bring programs,

events and new course offerings
related to these issues to campus,
according to board member Sara
Sprenkle.

Radulescu encouraged wom-
en to apply for leadership posi-

_ tions on campus. She said that

we need more than “token wom-
en,” we need a “critical mass” of
women in leadership roles.

Dolan ended her speech by
saying that she has hope for this
generation to bring about true
gender equality. Before opening
up the floor for audience ques-
tions, she said, “we need femi-
nism now more than ever.”

C finalizes budget policychange

A new policy implemented by the EC requires student organizations to update the Committee twice during the year

By Eleanor Kennedy
mews EDITOR

After multiple meetings and
several revisions, Washington
and Lee’s Executive Committee
has adopted a policy to audit stu-
dent organizations twice a year.

The plan, proposed by Vice
President Bill Larson, requires
student organizations to update
the EC on their activities every
November and February. Infor-
mation Technology Services is
creating forms which student
organizations can simply ﬁll out

and e-mail to the EC.

Larson drafted a proposal
about three weeks ago which de-
veloped a system for auditing or-
ganizations. Student organization
heads were then invited to three
meetings where they could voice
their concerns and suggestions.
Larson and the other EC mem-
bers worked together to compose
the ﬁnal plan, which incorporates
many of the students’ sugges-
tions.

The vote to pass the new plan
was unanimous.

EC President

Scott Centorino said everyone on
the EC was very excited about the
new version of the policy, which
he called “infinitely more stream-
lined” than the original draft.‘
Centorino said that many stu-
dents were worried that increased
EC oversight would involve more
bureaucracy and put an undue
burden on them. “A lot of mem-
bers of the EC echoed a lot of the
students’ campaigns,” he said.
After meetings with the stu-
dent organization heads high-
lighted several of the problem
areas of the proposal, the EC
developed and voted on the new
draft. Centorino and Larson both
praised the collaborative effort to
make the proposed plan a reality.
According to Larson, “The
new policy brings together the
best ideas of the EC and student
leaders to create a policy that will
ensure the student body’s money
is spent responsibly and effec-
tively, while not being overly
burdensome on student leaders.”

Centorino said he was pleased
with the EC’s responsiveness.
“What you saw was a really good
example of student government
responding to student concerns
in a really aggressive way,” said
Centorino.

The EC did more than just
increase its oversight of student
organization at its last meeting. lt
also created a new award to re-
ward student organizations that
excel at providing valuable pro-
gramming while managing their
funds effectively and responsi-
bly.

The Americus White Award,
named after the ﬁrst President of
the student body, will be awarded
every spring to a student organi-
zation chosen by the EC.

Centorino said that the award
will likely be accompanied by a
monetary prize to be used as the
winning organization sees ﬁt.

Administration and students responded to police concerns

After on-campus parties were shut down during homecoming due to noise complaints, the school worked carefully
with the Lexington Police A *

Dear Editor,

I am writing in response to
Stockton Bullitt’s October ll ar-
ticle, “The War on Noise and its
Effect on Off-Campus Parties at
W&L.” I read Mr. Bullitt’s ar-
ticle on the evening of the llth
and, after reading one of his ﬁnal’
lines: “Like I already pointed
out, the adults stopped reading
this long ago,” I felt compelled
to contact him directly. I felt
the need to contact him, ﬁrst,
because I wanted him to know
I do, indeed, read his column
every week ~ as I read each and
every Ring-Tum Phi and, sec-
ond, because I disagreed with
the assumption that “the admin-
istration” wouldn’t have much
interest in police shutting down
an event. He also discussed, at

length, the concern that shutting
down on-campus events encour-
ages students to go to off-cam-
pus events which, inherently, are
likely to have a higher degree of
risk. He also posited the correla-
tion that donations to the institu-
tion drive decision-making about
policy.

While I won’t go into as great
of detail as I did with Mr. Bullitt
in our email exchange and, later,
in our in-person conversation, I
will share that the “administra-
tion” is VERY interested in see-
ing events happen on campus.
l’ll brieﬂy share what actually
happened in response to one of
the cases cited by Mr. Bullitt in
his op-ed piece. The social chair
of the fraternity sponsoring one
of the events contacted me on

Sunday. ‘By Monday morning,
Student Affairs staff made con-
tact with the Lexington Police
to understand why the event was
shut down and, by Wednesday,
Student Affairs staff worked
with leadership of that fraternity
to convey the concerns and offer
suggestions as to how to avoid
in the future noise concerns that
were raised.

Regarding on-campus so-
cial events, 'I am very thank-
ful to Lindsay Crawford in his
leadership of the Interfraternity
Council, and for encouraging
fraternities to host events on
campus. And I am thankful to
individual house leadership who
chose to make the call and ask
for assistance when something
didn’t seem to be working right,

as opposed to simply going off-
campus in the future and making
higher risk choices. Such actions
on the part of IFC and house
leadership demonstrate a willing-
ness to work together. Likewise,
every signal I am receiving from
the new Lexington Police Chief
is that he and his staff want to
support students in safer choices.
And, with all of that said, laws
are laws and blatant violation
of laws results in arrests (and/or
sanctions in the University con-
duct system).
To be clear, donations do not
drive policy  student safety,
our educational mission and the
laws of the Commonwealth of
Virginia, drive policy. Anyone
iwho examines beneath the sur-
face of that statement can quick-

ly see that some might argue
student safety and the laws of the
Commonwealth may be in con-
tradiction. For example, if we
know students are going to drink
underage, can’t we just provide
a safe place for them to do that?
From my perspective it is a valid
point to make, but Washington
and Lee must abide by the laws
of Virginia in its policies — in
the same way private citizens
must abide by laws. And so we
provide the central message: “It
is illegal to drink underage, but
if you’re going to do so, please
do so in the safest manner pos-
sible and do not call attention to
yourself in your conduct.” In the
end, we are educators, not law
enforcement, and we put our role
as educators ﬁrst and foremost

No chase, big challenge: why being easy is hard

Campbell explains some of the pitfalls that can occur without parental supervision during freshman year

Everyone wants something
they can’t have. '

There is nothing as thrilling
as a chase and nothing as satisfy-
ing as a catch.

When I was little, most of
the things that I wanted were out
of reach because of my parents’
rules or my age.

I remember...

...sitting in the driver’s seat
of a stationary car for hours, talk-
ing on my “cell phone” and pick-
ing up my dolls from “school”. ..

Much has changed since
the days of time-outs, playing
house, and my mother’s strict
“one dessert a day” rule. Life has
changed.

Here at Washington and Lee,

ery kind of food I could hope for
at D-hall. Reese’s frozen yogurt
with honey, bananas, M&M’s
and chocolate sauce sound
weird? Everyone’s doing it. And

same walk of shame back to the
dessert table.

I can drink as many Cokes as I

everything that I could ever want

doing anything else. All of my

overdose or struggling to keep
my eyes open wide enough to
make the teacher think I’m look-

dents make choices that take into

ing the type of student leader that

leadership.

Thanks, Mr. Bullitt, for rais-

Strategy for finding the right teachers at Washington & Lee

How to minimize Snapes and maximize Dumbledores in the process of searching for classes

By Tim McAleenan
COLU MNIST

Now that half the semester
has already passed us by, our
dear freshmen (ahem, ﬁrst-years)
have ﬁnally learned what the rest
of us upperclassmen have known
for quite awhile.

Thomas Jefferson may have
said that all men are created
equal, but when it comes to pro-
fessorial teaching quality, noth-
ing could be further from the
truth.

To give you a rough estimate,
teaching quality breaks down
roughly to a I0-20-40-20-10
tiered system‘. .

The top tier is self-explanato-
ry. It consists of the three or four
life-changing professors you
encounter during your time at
W&L, and you can only describe
them with words like “Dumb-
ledore.”

At the tier right below them,
you encounter the professors
with their heads screwed on
straight.

As you will learn, this is
quite rare in academia, and these
professors must be clutched onto
at all costs. You’re drinking their
kool-aid, so to speak, and you
make sure to sign up for any
classes they teach that remotely
relate to your major. This is
good.

The middle tier is, by deﬁ-
nition, average. When describ-

’ ing your experience with these

teachers, you say things like
“Well, I,had to, for my major...”
or “At least I got a B.”

By the time you get to the
second-to-last tier, things are re-
ally moving downhill. These are
the types of professors who are
responsible for most of the page
views on the Registrar’s website
for dropping classes.

You’re not sure what the Fac-
ulty EC even means, but sud-
denly, the thought of dealing
with them and $100 ﬁnes doesn’t
seem like such a bad thing after
all.

These teachers are not always
easy to spot, but as a general rule,
they are usually teaching classes
that are absolutely required for
the completion of a given major.

And then there’s the bottom
ten percent.

This is what happens when
you merge the -personalities of
people who shouldn’t be allowed
too close to stoves and have the
personalities of Napoleonic Deb-
bie-Downers.

When you take a class with
them, you begin to understand
why tenure is every professor’s
wet dream, because no matter
how bad things get, like Brett
Favre, they’re here to stay.

And if you ever see the num-
ber “36” or “24” in a student’s
notebook, that means you have
found one of these teachers, be-
cause even on the ﬁrst day, the
student knew he had to start the
countdown until the end of the
term. ‘

But luckily, there are a few
mechanisms you can utilize to

avoid taking classes with the
Snapes of the teaching profes-
sion.

The ﬁrst, and most common
of all, is to visit the website
ratemyprofessor.com. I don’t
particularly recommend this op-
tion. Think about it, what type
of people are going to create an
account and leave feedback for a
professor?

Someone who has an extreme
experience with the professor:
they’re either spending their eve-
nings wondering what the Vir-
ginia laws are on student/profes-
sor relations, or they are crafting
a voodoo doll of that professor
Gust because, you never know, it
might work). .

Most of the opinions on rate-

, myprofessor tend to be extreme,

and I have found only a little bit
of correlation between the online
postings and the reality of a giv-
en teacher’s quality.

, You’d be much better offjust
asking someone in your frater-
nity or sorority for an opinion,
rather than consulting ratemy--
professor.

But when I want to get a de-
cent read on a professor before
signing up for classes, I usu-
ally send them an e-mail asking
about the course or to see if there
is room for additional students.

And here’s what to look for. If

you get an unduly long response

or a really quick response, run.
The best response I have ever
received when asking to join a

class was, “Why not?” Short,
mildly-humorous, and simple.
Ask this professor to be your
academic advisor on the spot.

Another important thing to
pay attention to is the professor’s
signature at the end of the e-
mail.

it can be incredibly insightful.
Ask the teacher to e-mail
you a copy of the syllabus be-
fore class starts. It can tell you
so much.
, I mean, a syllabus shouldn’t
be a threatening document, and
there are little warning buzz

tree!” You’re going to have a fun
semester with that guy.

Heck, one professor even in-
cluded the line (I’m paraphras-
ing here) “I’m a deals kind of
guy” in the syllabus. You don’t
think that is going to come in
handy around exam time? Like

Thomas Jefferson may have said that all men are created equal, but

when it comes to professorial teaching quality, nothing could be further

from the truth. To give you a rough estimate, teaching quality breaks
down roughly to a 10-20-40-20-I0 tier—system.

The number one sign of a
professor to avoid is a long tag-
line that lists all of the professor’s
accomplishments dating back to
their own graduation.

I don’t even know where to
begin on this one. It just sort of
comes off as pathetic and desper-
ate.

It would be like changing
your birthday on Facebook every
month to get girls to talk to you. I
mean, come on. There’s gotta be
a better way.

If you’re a quality teacher,
you accomplishments will shine
through in the classroom, and
you won’t have to brag about it.

If their e-mails are preten-
tious, imagine four months in the
classroom...

As for my last suggestion,
most students don’t do this, but

words to watch out for that can
give you a glimpse of things to
come.

My rule is to count to ﬁve.
If the teacher hands you a syl-
labus that mentions the number
“zero,” includes adjectives like
“unacceptable,” uses verbs like
“fail,” and includes nouns like
“penalty” and “violation,” steer
clear.

To use a dating metaphor, if
this is how the professor is going
to act on the ﬁrst date, imagine
what things will be like during
marriage. Yikesl

Ideally, you want to ﬁnd signs
of reasonableness or humor
(even if it’s incredibly dry) in a
syllabus. A calculus professor’s
syllabus once included’ the line
“What is a tree’s favorite class?
(Drum roll please) Gee, I’m a

anything else, when it comes to
syllabuses (or is it syllabi?), tone
means everything.

That’s about it. Visiting a
teacher during office hours won’t
help much; there must be a rule
somewhere that all professors
must maintain mini-libraries in
their oﬂices.

But again, if you can ﬁnd ev-
idence of a sense of humor, take

- that professor’s class.

If you do it right, you’ll spend
your ﬁrst two years here weeding
out the good and bad professors,
and then you can spend your
junior and senior years taking
classes with a strong nucleus of
the best four or ﬁve you’ve had
at W&L.

Epic drama on the national political stage this November

With Democrats spending needless time and money creating political drama, Beall asks where the issues went

By John Paul Beall
COLUMNIST

All across the nation political

battles to the death have grown-

increasingly intense as many
candidates have pulled out all the
stops leading up to the big day:
November 2.

Incumbents and political in-
siders have sought to maintain
the status quo, but more and
more Americans are growing
so dissatisﬁed with the political
performance that we all can be
certain that change is coming,
just not at the hands of those who
promised it.

In California, where we lay
our scene, the stores of drama
know no bounds in times of po-
litical peace or war.

The candidates for California
Senate, Barbara Boxer-D and
Carly Fiorina-R, have locked

released information that’ Meg
Whitman had employed an il-
legal immigrant as her house-
keeper, and ﬁred her not too long
before the campaign began.

His claim is that she knew the
housekeeper was illegal, though
records show that the housekeep-
er was hired via an employment
agency, which had social secu-
rity and a driver’s license on ﬁle
for her. She had been in Califor-
nia since 1992, when one could
acquire a license without proving
citizenship.

Of course, who better to‘ de-
fend the housekeeper but the
infamous star-chasing attorney
Gloria Allred, an active Demo-
crat who has a penchant for creat-
ing very graphic media conflicts?
For her role in this obvious move

When he thought he had hung
up the phone, Brown and some
of his campaign staff started in
on a conversation resulting in
someone (most now think it was
Mrs. Brown) calling Meg Whit-
man a whore, and Brown heartily
agreeing.

Califomia’s branch of the Na-
tional Organization of Women,
who is endorsing Brown, "de-
manded disciplinary measures
from Brown for the use of the
offensive term. Later, however,
NOW—~like Gloria Allred—ac-
knowledged political expediency

Whitman a “political whore.”

feature some particularly unﬂat-
tering pictures of her opponent in

done the same: showing Barbara
Boxer looking aged, vexed and
maybe drooling a little.

For the California Guber-
natorial race, Jerry Brown-D
(formerly known as “Govemor
Moonbeam”) has also _ engaged
in smear tactics towards Repub-
lican Meg Whitman (commonly
referred to as eBay Lady), who
had been leading by a fairly large
margin.

Just aﬁer the ﬁrst political
debate, the Brown campaign

for publicity and political sake,
she was lampooned in an open-
ing sketch of SNL.

The San Francisco Chroni-
cle, Brown’s hometown news-
paper and one of the most liberal
papers in the nation, came out in
defense of Whitman and still re-

» fuses to endorse the Brown cam-

paign.

But Brown is famous for his
gaffes, and he made a pretty big
one that has all but reversed the
small effects of his smear cam-
paign. He made a phone call to a
Police Department Union in Los
Angeles and left a message ask-
ing for a political endorsement.
Even as Califomia’s current At-
torney General, Brown has lost
many of the law enforcement en-
dorsements to Whitman.

THE MEDIA BOARD

fomia is an interesting choice on
NOW’s part. But I guess in poli-

tics, drastic times call for drastic A

measures.
California is not the only place
where campaigning has got-

ten messy. In Delaware, Barack‘

Obama and Joe Biden descended
into the ring to back the Demo-
cratic candidate for Senate, Chris
Coons, over the Republican
Christine O’Donnell.

O’Donnell’s momentum has
been spirited away due to the
subsequent controversy over her
dabbling in witchcraﬁ, also high-
lighted in several SNL sketches.

The’ Obama administration
appeared at a very appropriate
place considering the theatrical
nature of the current political
climate.

They went to the largest op-
era house in Delaware and sang

songs of praise for Coons. All
this vocal support seems unne-
essary, particularly because at
this point Coons expects to win
the race easily. Bloomberg.com
observes, “Because Delaware
is in the same media market as
Philadelphia, the president’s visit
also draws attention in the larg-
est metropolitan area of Penn-
sylvania, where Democratic U.S.
Senate candidate Joe Sestak is

engaged in a close contest with,

Republican candidate Pat Toom-
ey.” ~
Leaving Wilmington, the
Obama troupe continued its na-
tion-wide tour by visiting Mas-
sachusetts for the incumbent
Democratic governor Deval Pat-
rick, who is in a fairly close race.
After that, they went to Ohio (the
Great Lakes swing state) where
the Democratic candidates are
suffering at the hands of their
Republican opponents.

Obama is especially inter-
ested in Ohio because one of its
Republican senators is retiring.

He then went down the west
coast and is now in Nevada.
Clearly, the President who was
supposed to usher in an enor-
mous amount of change has a lot
of spare time right now. I’m just
wondering why the taxpayer has
to pay for his gasoline!

South Carolina’s political
stage for the past year has been
airing drama, and it has only
continued through elections.

Inﬁdelity seems to be the the-
atrical theme as incumbent Gov-
emor Mark Sanford received
censure last June over his misuse
of state travel funds -to see his
Argentinean mistress. Making
matters worse, the GOP hope-
ﬁll Nikki Haley has been twice
accused of inﬁdelity in commer-
cials.

And all the while, W&L
alumnus Joe Wilson is still catch-
ing heat for his famous two-word
interjection, “You lie!”

/

But for the Senate seat, there
is a twist. Apparently, a ghost is
challenging the Republican in-
cumbent Jim DeMint. His oppo-
nent Alvin Greene is a 32-year-
old unemployed veteran who
won the Democratic nomination
with more than l00,000 votes

‘without any rallies or campaign

websites.

But this ghost has skeletons in
his closet, as it seems Greene has
felony charges brought against
him for showing lewd Internet
pictures to a college student.

But where are the issues? Ap-
parently they are on vacation in
Buenos Aires. '

There are many more cases
of drama across the US: think
Kentucky, Florida and Nevada.
However, the important point
here is that our political system’s
affection for the drama of poli-
tics over the function of our gov-
ernment is a big reason for the
recent failures sustained by our
government.

The party in power is guilty
of transforming the politicized
sections of our government into a
realm where spectacle means too
much and substance too little.

For example, ObamaCare
was not about providing Ameri-
ca with the best possible solution
to recent health care problems.
Rather, it was about a public dis-
play of power and revenge, by
putting on a C-SPAN prime time
showing of Titus Andronicus
with the GOP playing the part of
Ophelia.

All anyone needs to do any-
more to explode the diet in Con-
gressional deliberation is label
the other group with one word,
“extremist,” with or without just
cause.

Responses to the current po-
litical system, especially the Tea
Party movement and Republi-
can momentum in the elections,
seem to show that the American
people feel the need for govem-

ment to quit playing dress-up
and get back to the fundamentals
of government.

Why else would Constitution-
al themes take such prominence
in these political reactions?
America wants the stability and
equilibrium of a more perfect
union that the Constitution was
supposed to ensure.

America wants its problems
ﬁxed, and indeed there are more
than a few, but it does not want
each of these problems to be-
come mere stage settings in a
congressional reality TV show.

First order of business should
be the economy.

In engaging in behavior that
can only render political instabil-
ity, how can the economy recu-
perate? Economies thrive under
politically stable conditions, and
in examining the playbill of this
last Congress, there was nothing
politically stable about it.

As this most tumultuous of
decades comes to a close, we are
provided with a choice.

We can move on, or we can
continue to relive the past and
suffer at the hands of political
playwrights as we have suffered
for the past four years.

We can choose to bring an im-
mediate end to the cycle that ails
our nation, or we can perpetuate
that cycle and bring a mighty na-
tion to a slow and humiliating
decline.

That choice is manifest in an-
other choice, and fortunately we
live in a country where it is ours
to make.

You can vote and end it all, or
remain silent and leave America
to its political upheaval.

This is the election of a life-
time, and we all need to be
heard.

Adding a personal tone to the debate
over Obamacare

With elections looming, Victor Jackson puts to rest some of the debate over
health care by sharing his own experience

By Victor Jackson
c o L u M N IS T

Republicans have, over the
last year, told the American peo-
ple again and again of the alleged
evils of the program they have
lovingly coined “Obamacare”.

This evil program is the gov-
ernment overstepping its bounds,
they say, intruding into our per-
sonal lives and wrecking the free
market, an institution our coun-
try values so much. This could
not be farther from the truth.

The health care system in
America has, over the last 20
years, grown more and more
into a proﬁt-maximizing institu-
tion.

My mother, going through an
autologous bone marrow trans-
plant procedure last December,
had a month-long stay in the hos-
pital. _

Looking at the health insur-
ance statement showing the
crazy costs of such simple things
as bags of saline and clean bed
sheets every day was shocking.

More shocking was the small,
5-milliliter vial of medicine that
I held for a nurse one day’ when I

"visited my mother which, when I
checked later, costs $15,000.

I understand the costs associ-
ated with health care today.

I understand that advances in
treatment increase the costs of
medicine.

I have encountered many pro-
cedures as my mom has received
treatments, which are brand-new

and very effective, but very cost-
ly in their infancy. '

But like all other technologies,
the costs should trend downward
the farther they are from their be-
ginning, not upward.

regarding the simple, inexpen-
sive parts of a hospital stay like

a bag of sterile saline and clean-

sheets—it is clear that some-
thing has gone wrong. Health
care shouldn’t be about making

having to worry about whether or
not they will be the next person
to be struck with a debilitating
disease which they cannot afford
to cure.

We may be at the cutting

We may be at the cutting edge of health care technology in the world,

and we may have the worlds best health care system—for those who

can aﬂord it at least—but its time to make sure we extend this to

everyone, not just the privileged few who are fortunate enough to afford
the inﬂated costs of health care today.

I also understand that the doc- —

tors, nurses and professionals
who have toiled for many years
to become the experts they are
deserve to be paid well. That I
do not deny.

Over the last two years, I have
met many knowledgeable, caring
individuals who, every day, give
patients I 10 percent of their time,
attention and effort to make sure
they are improving and stay-
ing well, both in body and mind
—and they truly deserve com-
pensation for the amazing work
they do.

But when the prices of pro-
cedures which are not optional,
but required in order for people
to live, are so high—especially

as much money as you can, it
should be about health.

Republicans may complain
about health care reform, but I
say it’s about time.

It’s about time we take some-
thing as important as life out of
the hands of proﬁt-driven corpo-
rations.

It’s about time we make sure
that those who encounter dis-
eases and problems they are born
with, or that they develop not as
a consequence of their actions
but simply out of happenstance,
are taken care of during and after
their treatment.

It’s about time we make health
insurance more affordable so that

all people have the beneﬁt of not

edge of health care technology
in the world, and we may have
the world’s best health care sys-
tem—for those who can afford
it at least—but it’s time to make
sure we extend this to everyone,
not just the privileged few who
are fortunate enough to afford
the inflated costs of health care
today.

That’s why I support health
care reform.

It upholds that American ideal
that, no matter what your posi-
tion in life is, you always have
the ability and the tools to make
yourself better and be successﬁil,
despite what obstacles might be
put in your way.

Presidential assassins subject of controversial play

W&L students portray the lives and mentalities of several successful and attempted presidential assassinations

By Anthony Ballor
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s Music,
Theater and Dance Departments
present Stephen Sondheim’s As-
sassins, premiering October 28
in Lenfest Hall’s Keller Theatre.
Assassins is a controversial (and
musical) look at ten successful
and attempted presidential assas-
sins. Featuring an ensemble cast
which includes senior Johnny
Coyle as John Wilkes-Booth,
sophomore Tyson Janney as
Charles Guiteau (the assassin of
President Garﬁeld), senior Dave
Curran as Leon Czolgosz (who
killed William McKinley), As-
sassins presents pe0ple—some
patriots, some anarchistsrwho

have been viliﬁed by history,
despite motivations that were
sometimes noble.

‘ The play begins in a sinister
playground, where the Propri-
etor (sophomore Jay Stephens)
meets assassins from various
periods of American history, and
assures them that they can solve»
their personal problems by kill-
ing a president. Their problems
range from “[the] constitutional
right to peaceably petition the
government for the redress of
grievances” to, in the case ofGi-
useppe Zangara, a simple stom-
achache. Throughout the play,
we see the assassins talk to each

other~even though this would
have been impossible in many
cases—often egging each other
on to commit their crimes, or
convincing innocent people to
murder. For example, Lee Har-
vey Oswald is presented as plan-
ning to kill himself before the
assassins convince him to aim at
President Kennedy instead, tell-
ing him that murder is the only
way he can become part of the
American experience.

Assassins is clearly a gritty
play, one which confronts the as-
sassins themselves, but also con-
fronts the audience; it implores
us to ask ourselves what lengths

we would go to in our pursuit
of the American dream. Those
who are interested in history will
also be interested in Sondheim’s
transformation of the assassins.
Generally we know little about
assassins besides the nature of
their crimes, but on stage they
become human. The audience
sees both their transgressions,
and the aspirations which steered
them toward their fateful deci-
sions.

But don’t forget that despite
its subject matter, Assassins is a
musical. The pit band, directed
by Peter Del Vecchio, is distinc-
tive because it is staffed entirely

by students and community
members. Previously, pit bands
for the Bentley musicals had
been staffed by hired, profes-
sional musicians, but now, ten of
the fourteen members of the pit
band are students. The decision
to have student performers was
made in order to allow for more
educational opportunities for stu-
dent musicians, but according to
Del Vecchio, “the audience won’t
miss the professionals at all”.
For director Rob Mish, “Sond-
heim’s genius as a composer and
lyricist is evident mostly in his
treatment of the ‘period’ pieces
throughout the work.” Sondheim

plays with the music associated
with his material~for example,
look for strains of “Hail to the
Chief’ in a waltz, or a nod to
Sousa’s famous marches. Sond-
heim’s ability to suit his music to
the shows different time settings
results in some truly “humma—
ble” music, according to Mish.

Assassins will play in the
Keller Theater on Oct. 28-30 at
7:30 p.m. and on Oct. 31 at 3
p.m. Tickets are $5 for students
and can be purchased at the Box
Office by calling (540)458-8000,
or online at lenfest.wlu.edu.

Artist inspired by sense of environment

Artist Ray Kass speaks to W&L community abauthis exhibit in Staniar Gallery and his artistic techniques, experiences

By Holly Suthers
ARTS & LIFE EDITOR

Artist Ray Kass spoke to mem-
bers of the Washington and Lee
community this past Wednesday
in Wilson Hall. The renowned
artist discussed his exhibit “Since
Painting in the South,” his career
experience and his sources of in-
spiration.

“Since Painting in the South”
features a selection of 'Kass’s
paintings from the past thirty
years. The artist chose to present
these paintings because he felt
that they represented his relation-
ship with landscapes and the en-
vironment. Kass told students that

he seeks inspiration for his work
by spending signiﬁcant amounts
of time outdoors.

He believes that his work rep-
resents the essence of nature and
the emotional feelings that people
experience in various environ-
ments. Kass also said that he tries
to avoid creating literal represen-
tations of his pieces, but instead
wants viewers to interact with the
painting physically or by inciting
a memory.

Along with his artistic accom-
plishments, Kass is the founder
and director of the Mountain Lake

Workshop. According to the orga-
nization’s website, the workshops
are used to teach artists to use the
“environmental and technological
resources of the New River Val-
ley and the Appalachian region.”
Several well-known artists have
participated in Mountain Lake
workshops, such as'Howard Fin-
ster, J iro Okura, and John Cage.
Kass is a nationally recog-
nized painter and has had works
exhibited across the county. The
majority of his pieces currently
reside in the Reynolds Gallery in
Richmond, Va. Staniar Gallery

will exhibit Kass’ paintings until
Nov. 11.

Kass is currently a Professor
Emeritus of Art at Virginia Tech.

his work, visit his website: http://

Lee defeats Jackson in Classic

Men 3 lacrosse closes the fall season with a 16-5 victory over VMI

By Jayna Johns
SPORTS EDITOR

Washington and Lee’s men’s lacrosse
team took apart the Virginia Military Insti-
tute’s team on Saturday for a 16-5 victory
in this year’s Lee-Jackson Classic.

Over 600 spectators attended the 24th
annual encounter between the two teams,
played at VM1’s Foster Stadium, as, W&L
scored three points in every period except
the third—where they put up seven.

The Generals’ scoring for the day was

led by junior Scott Meehan and sopho- .

more Jack Switala, who each scored four
goals. Sophomore Cooper Brown contrib-
uted with three assists for the game. Mee-
han also added two assists.

Meehan was awarded the Worrell-Fal-
lon Trophy at the end of the game, which
is presented to the team MVP from each
squad. Freshman Ross Whitehead earned
the honor for VM1 as he contributed two
goals for the Keydets.

The Generals started the game strong,
quickly scoring three straight goals, each
of which came courtesy of Meehan. VM1
put up their ﬁrst score in the second quar-
ter, but the Generals could not be stopped.
The Keydets’ ﬁrst score was the closest
they would get to the Generals, who an-
swered VM1’s goal by putting up seven
unanswered scores. The Generals were

leading 10-1 just minutes into the third
period.

Ending a nearly 16-minute scoring
drought, VM1 managed to score two goals
in the third and add two more in the ﬁnal

minutes of the game, but they could do ‘

nothing against the Generals attack.

Six of the Generals’ scores did come
from VM1 penalties, as they racked up 17
for the day. But W&L outshot VM1 46-20,
clearly showing their ability to ﬁnd scor-
ing opportunities.

Saturday’s game marked the end of the
fall season for the Generals. They will be-
gin play again in February.

By Jayna Johns
SPORTS EDlTOR

teams resulted in a split against Mary
Washington last Friday night.

The men beat the Eagles with a score
of 141-121, while the women fell 149.5-

Five different Generals, had ﬁrst-place
ﬁnishes for the men. Junior Brian Stirling
and sophomore Rick Sykes led the team,
each claiming a victory in an individual
event while also playing a role in two win-
ning relays. Stirling and Sykes were part of
the victorious 200—yard medley relay team
and 200-yard freestyle relay, and Stirling
won the 100-yard freestyle event while
Sykes took the top spot in the 50-yard free-

style event. .

Kasoff had two ﬁrst-place ﬁnishes for the
Generals, ﬁrst in the 100-yard butterfly,
followed by the 200-yard individual med-
ley. Junior Katie Salvati also won an in-
dividual event, taking the top spot in the
100 fly.

in the ODAC Relays held at W&L, which »

ended in an impressive home team win
over six other schools.

The team captured six event victories,
led again by Kasoff, who was part ofthree

winning relay teams. Juniors Katie Salvati -9

and Dana Fredericks, sophomore Brittany
Ross and ﬁrst-year Rebecca Lawrence

Housing
pitfalls

Dealing with bags, bats and
bad landlords .

By Courtney Ridenhour
STAFF WRITER

lt’s that time of year again. The leaves are falling,
Barbour jackets are making a return to campus and
leases are being signed.

After the security deposit is in, all that’s left to
do is name the place and answer the all-important
question of where the beer pong table will go. But
the joys of leasing a fabulous off-campus house can
be cut short by the discovery of bugs. Or, in the case
of junior Grace Cushman, bats. '

Cushman and her four housemates had just set-
tled into their off-campus house when they received
the unsettling news.

“We had bats in our attic that we didn’t know
about when we ﬁrst signed the lease,” Cushman
said.

The group had to pay for an exterminator and_

evacuate the house for a week while it was fumi-
gated. Because the bats had been a problem before
the group moved in, the ﬁve students thought the
landlord should help pay for the exterminator. The
landlord disagreed.

“For the most part, we were pretty upset with our
landlord,” Cushman said. “We felt he may have tak-
en advantage of the fact that we had never lived in a
house before without our parents and had absolutely
no idea what we should pay for as tenants.”

“For students looking at housing:
don ’t stress and don ’t feel obli-
gated to sign a lease if you think...

repairs need to be done. ’

Danielle Bowman, senior

‘ Other students have also run into issues with their
landlords. Senior Danielle Bowman said her land-
lord has been unresponsive to repair requests.

“The problem is that she doesn’t own the house,
someone else does. And for anything to get done, we
have to wait until they’ve communicated. Getting
something done takes a lot longer,” she said.

The problem for many ﬁrst-time renters is that
they don’t know what to look for when they are
looking for a place. But Washington and Lee hasn’t
left students to completely fend for themselves.

lnforrnation on renters’ rights and a guide to off-
campus housing are available on the Washington and
Lee website under Residential Life. The 28-page
guide includes a list of local real estate agencies and
a Home Condition Checklist. ‘I

Despite these resources, when renters do run
into trouble with landlords, W&L has “no legal
recourse,” Dean of Student Affairs Dawn Watkins
said. According to Watkins, signing a lease is a deal
between two private citizens and the school cannot
intervene.

If major problems occur, renters can submit a
written request for an inspection to the Rockbridge
County Building Department.

“There is no charge,” Rockbridge County Build-
ing Official Erich Schnetzler said. Depending on
the severity of the infraction, landlords are given
anywhere from one week to 30 days to remedy the
problem. .

The request can only be made by current tenants.
Students searching for a house need to be careful
and vigilant. ,

“The nuance that students have to understand is
what they’re buying,” said Watkins said.

Bowman said she learned some important les-
sons from her housing experience.

“For students looking at housing: don’t stress and
don’t feel obligated to sign a lease if you think some-
thing like repairs need to be done,” she said. “I felt
pressured because we sign leases so early. 1 pretty
much settled for the first house I saw.”

Cushman also offered advice for those in the
house-hunting process. “Know your landlord’s
reputation before you sign the lease, and make sure
you’re both aware of the expectations,” she said.

“Every house has its little issues and weird
tweaks, and having a heads-up about them before-
hand would have saved us a lot of time.”

VOLUME CXIV,

Washington and Lee is capital campaign seeks to raise $500 million in seven years

By Paige Gance
STAFF w RITER -
Washington and Lee University’s

capital campaign, “Honor Our Past,
Build Our Future,” launched into its
public phase with the announcement
ofa $500 million goal.

This goal was revealed at a kick-
off celebration on Oct. 22, with 350
trustees, donors and friends of the
university in attendance. The quiet
phase began on July 1, 2008. The
entire campaign will last seven years
and end on June 30, 2015.

The campaign goal is one of the
highest ever set by a liberal arts col-
lege. It doubles W&L’s last cam-
paign, “For the Rising Generation,”
which totaled almost $243 million
and ended in Dec. 2003.

Donations thus far total $310 mil-
lion and include Rupert H. Johnson’s
gift of $100 million and Gerry Len-
fest’s gift of $50 million.

According to Vice President of
University Advancement Dennis
Cross, early progress is encouraging.
The campaign has raised 62 percent
of its goal, more than the 40-60 per-
cent Cross said a quiet phase of a
campaign should raise.

“Our goal is aggressive, but
reachable,” said Cross. “We have
great conﬁdence in our abilities to
meet it.”

The campaign breaks the total
goal into ﬁve main categories, with
the ﬁrst four adhering closely to the

  

  
   
 

‘ii

 
  

University’s 10-year Strategic Plan
developed in 2007. These include
student recruitment, faculty and staff,
campus improvement and academic
programs. The last category is grow-
ing the annual fund, which isnot part
of the Strategic Plan but still vital for
the University’s ﬁnancial ﬂexibility.

Cross describes the priorities of
this campaign as more broad based
than the last one. He said the differ-
ence is like that between a riﬂe and
a shotgun.

According to Cross, the ﬁnal goal
amount is based on a compromise
between the estimated cost of the
Strategic Plan and an evaluation of
potential donors’ abilities to give.

“It allowed us to think of what are
the highest priorities of the Strategic
Plan,” said Cross. The difference be-
tween the cost of the Strategic Plan
and the campaign goal is an extra
$100 million. Cross said that reallo-
cation of funds, tuition revenue, and
loans could cover this gap.

The estimated goal began more
modestly, only $400-450 million.
Cross recalled a meeting of the cam-
paign cabinet in New York City in
Nov, 2008, right as the economic
downturn intensiﬁed.

“Things seemed bleak,” said
Cross. They continued their plan
however, and as the quiet phase pro-
gressed, “it became clear that 400

was too small, we could go higher.”

Campaign Co-Chair Phil Norman
said that a signiﬁcant portion of the
goal has already been invested in the
ﬁrst two priorities because of John-
son and Lenfest’s gifts.

Since the Johnson Scholarship
program was announced, the number
of applicants to W&L has increased
from 3,700 to 6,200. The gift also
established a lecture series, opportu-
nity grants and two new professor-
ships.

“We want to bring in students
from all over the country and the
world so that we have a more diverse
environment for students to learn in,
that is more reflective of the world
in which they will spend the rest of
their lives,” said Norman.

The gift from Lenfest focused
more on recruiting and retaining
exceptional faculty. According to
Cross, the salaries of W&L profes-

sors are 10 percent lower than those

at peer institutions.

Funds from Lenfest will be used
to improve professor salaries as well
as to support research, sabbaticals,
visiting scholars and faculty initia-
tives in emerging areas such as envi-
ronmental science and entrepreneur-
ship.

“We want to keep our great teach-
ers active scholars,” said Cross. V

Of the remaining goal, $120.5

aignijellofc

° $160m for student recruitment

° $122m for faculty and staff

° $120.5m for facilities

° $37.5m for academic programs

- ALSO: growing annual fund $60m

million will support campus im-
provements such as the Colonnade
renovation and a new indoor athletic
facility. Academic programs like
Spring Term and internships will re-
ceive $37.5 million. The campaign
will also increase the annual fund to
$9 million per year.

While these investments will im-
prove many facets of the University,
Campaign Co-Chair Warren Ste-
phens said that W&L will stay true
to its traditions and core academic
offerings.

“I think any major change in the
way Washington and Lee educated
young people would be ﬁercely re-
sisted by the board and by every con-
stituency we could possible think of.
We’re not looking to make wholesale
changes in how we operate,” said
Stephens.

As the public phase of the cam-
paign moves forward, the cabinet
will focus on matching donor inter-
ests to particular priorities, Cross
said. Rector J. Donald Childress is
conﬁdent that the Board of Trustees
and Campaign Cabinet will be able
to inspire gifts to the University.

“More than any other college or
university with which 1 am familiar,”
said the Rector, “those who come in
contact with this University develop
a relationship that is both intense and
indelible.”

 

This is a campaign of meaning and renewal. It is about our core mission

and its relevance to a very challenging future for Washington and Lee and
its students. And it is ambitious and historic. It will be noticed not only for
its reach but also for the priorities we have established within it. It says
something about this university.’ It also says something about the leadership
role we will assume in shaping the future of the liberal arts.’:*,‘;;e‘t-ii-,i‘i"

dary anchor speaks at W&L

Former CBS anchor Dan Rather delivers the keynote address at the 5 0th Institution on Ethics in Journalism

By Becky Mickel
STAFF WRITER

Speaking to a crowd of over
300 on Friday at Washington
and Lee University, former CBS
managing editor and anchor Dan
Rather compared passionate
journalism to the patriotic sacri-
ﬁce of soldiers ﬁghting overseas
to protect our country.

Rather’s speech, titled “The
Crisis in Journalism and Why
We Should Care,” was the key-
note address of the university’s
50th Institute on Ethics in Jour-
nalism. In addition to attending
Rather’s speech, W&L joumal-
ism students spent the weekend
discussing ethical issues with
journalism fellows from media
outlets around the country and
with Rather himself.

Although his speech was at
times very critical of the process
of news-gathering today, Rather

repeatedly including himself
when he spoke about the mis-
takes reporters often make.

Rather said that one of the
biggest, problems in journalism
today is the tendency of report-
ers to accept obviously “spun”
answers from authority ﬁgures
without asking needed follow-up
questions. i

According to Rather, journal-‘
ists have a patriotic duty to ask
the tough questions and to pre-
vent the crisis that stems from
insuﬁicient reporting. Because
journalists’ actions and inactions
can have just as much signiﬁ-
cance as the men and women in
uniform, reporters owe it to the
public to report the facts and to
protect democracy, said Rather.

In addition to shoddy report-
ing, Rather said conglomeration

and increasing entertainment
media has created a crisis for
journalists and the public.

“The news has become cor-
poratized, politicized and trivial-
ized,” said Rather. According to
Rather, news is now a byproduct
of international conglomerates,
safe thoughts and even safer re-
porting. ‘

Rather said that journalism is
crucial to democracy because it
allows America to remain a fact-
gathering society.

According to Rather, if jour-
nalism is to be rescued from the
“entertainment crisis,” the public
must educate themselves prior
to elections and news resources
must be available to the public.

Rather emphasized that free-
dom of the press is essential to
democracy, which is why it is

protected in the Constitution. He
did, however, distinguish free-
dom of the press from freedom
of the media. According to Rath-
er, entertainment media is not
protected at the same level as the
press because media is not news.

Although all forms of media
may not be protected, Rather
stressed the importance of de-
fending freedom of the press as
well as the importance of solid,
reliable well-researched news.

“[News is] for us, for Amer-
ica and for the freedom of the
ﬂag for which we stand,” said
Rather.

Payne Hall closed for renovation

Payne Hall, home of the W&L English department, is the next step in the Colonnade renovation project

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

As any student or faculty
member passing by the Colon-
nade may have noticed, the next
phase of the Colonnade preser-
vation and rehabilitation project
is underway. Phase 2B, the reno-
vation of Payne Hall, began in
late September.

Payne Hall is the home of the
Washington and Lee English De-
partment. Now that work on the
building has begun, the olﬁces of
the English Department profes-
sors have been temporarily relo-
cated to Baker Hall. The work
on Payne will be completed by
early August 2011, giving the
members of the department time
to get settled back into the build-
ing before classes start up again.

According to the university’s
Director of Design & Construc-
tion, Tom Kalasky, work will be
performed over the next year on
both the interior and exterior of

the building. Kalasky said that
the exterior of the building will
be “renewed and freshened” but
not changed in any major way.

The interior of the building is
another story.

New mechanical and electron-
ic systems will be installed on
the inside of Payne Hall, includ-
ing new ﬁre alarm and sprinkler
systems. Central air condition-
ing will replace the individual
air conditioning units that used
to jut out from almost all of the
windows of the building. The
building will also be completely
handicap-accessible, meeting

standards set by the Americans’

with Disabilities Act.

Kalasky said that the new
and improved Newcomb Hall is
a good benchmark for the work
that is to be done on Payne.

The new Payne Hall will con-
tain l2 faculty ofﬁces, a semi-

nar room, several classrooms
and a student lounge. Members
of the design and construction
team worked with deans from
the university to create the plan
for the interior of the building.
Classrooms will be located on all

floors, with the hope of increas-

ing student trafﬁc to all parts of
the building.

The design and construction
team is also attempting to mini-
mize the impact that the Colon-
nade preservation and rehabili-
tation project will have on the
environment. A waste manage-
ment plan was created in order
to maximize the amount of waste
that is recycled, as opposed to just
shipped off to the landﬁll. Also,
whenever possible, regional con-
struction materials are used. The
use of regional materials means
that fewer fossil fuels are used in
the transport of these materials

I because they come from nearby

suppliers.

Despite the fact that so much
work is being done to Payne
Hall, Kalasky said that the build-
ing is going to look pretty much
the same as it did before all of
the construction and rehabilita-
tion began.

“The simplicity of the archi-
tecture speaks for itself”

Payne Hall is the second
building on the Colonnade
to be renovated. The first,
Newcomb is an example of
coming improvements.

Moms and dads come to campus

Parents weekend events range from concerts and classes to athletic events, early-morning hikes and parties

By Chelsea Stevenson
STAFF WRITER

Every year students look for-
ward to the two fall days that are
spent with their parents, not at
home during Reading Days but
on campus, with approximately
2,000 other visitors.

If you ask a returning student,
they’ll tell you that they love
having fun with their parents,
who may or may not have been
Washington and Lee students
once themselves, at various par-
ties throughout the weekend.
These parties usually range from
“Tex Lex” (an event to celebrate
all of W&L’s Texans) to pledge
class dinners, and the traditional
Red Square band party. But be-
yond the nightlife that brings
parents back to their college
days, the W&L Student Affairs

Department has a lot in store for‘

this year’s Parents and Family
Weekend Celebration.

The weekend kicks off on Fri-
day, November 5, where parents
are welcomed to join students in

their classes. According to Nel-
lie Rice, the Executive Assistant
to the Vice President for Student
Affairs and Dean of Students,
parents are welcome to attend
any on campus class.

Before or after attending
class, parents should drop by the
registration table in the Elrod
Commons Living Room to pick
up a complimentary tote from
Student Affairs and student vol-
unteers.

Rice said she enjoys meeting
parents during registration, “they
email you, but it’s really nice
talking to them face-to-face.”

Parents will also have the op-
tion to attend pre-arranged Finan-
cial Aid Conferences throughout
the day. Between 1 p.m. and 6
p.m. several departments will
host open houses, for students
and their families to attend. The
open houses may include stu-
dent research presentations and
self-guided tours. Career ser-

vices will also host two events
on Friday: an open house and
an hour-long class titled “From
Major to Career.” Appointments
with faculty, administrators and
the University Registrar can also
be pre-arranged throughout the
weekend.

Original to this year’s Par-
ents and Family Weekend will
be an afternoon book signing
with alum Dr. Horace Douty,
class of’54. Douty is the author
of Histogg Lessons from a Coun-
try Church, a book about the
stories ofaRockbridge County’s
250-year-old Oxford Church.
The book signing will be held in
the Elrod Commons Atrium and
is sponsored by the W&L Book-
store.

Earlier on Friday evening,
families of ﬁrst-year students
will have the opportunity to at-
tend a Greek Life Q&A, and
ﬁrst-year females and their fami-
lies will have the chance to tour

the sorority houses. Following
the information on W&L’s Greek
recruitment process, ﬁrst-year
students and their parents are in-
vited to a reception at President
Ruscio’s house.

W&L has organized events for
families to continue on through
the night such as a Night-Sky
Viewing in the Canary Islands,
which will display photos of
planets and galaxies from a 14-
inch shared telescope. The Uni-
versity Choral Concert will take
place in the Wilson Hall Con-
cert Hall at 8 p.m. Tickets are
required for the concert but are
free of charge.

After a long day of tagging
along with students and seeing
what life at W&L in 2010 is re-
ally about, the fun will continue
bright and early on Saturday.
Clay Coleman, director of Stu-
dent Activities and Greek Life,
will direct a 6:30 a.m. morning
run throughout campus. For ex-

ercise fans who ﬁnd 6:30 a.m.
too early after a long night with
their students, the Cycling Club,
also known as Team Traveller,
will lead an hour-long bike ride
for all skill levels.

Once mid-moming exercise
has concluded, the Generals Ral-
ly and Luncheon will be held in
the dining hall before the l p.m.
football game. The rally will fea-
ture the University Jazz Ensem-
ble in the Marketplace. Tickets
are $8.75 per person.

In addition to the football
game against Hampden-Sydney,
W&L swimming will face off
against Randolph Macon Col-
lege at l p.m.

After the athletic events, there
will be a special welcome recep-
tion for grandparents in the Elrod
Commons.

W&L’s a cappella groups and
University Wind Ensemble will
hold concerts Saturday night.
Both events require tickets,

which can be obtained through
the box oﬁice. According to
Rice, the concerts during the
celebratory weekend have been
very well attended in past years.

The W&L Student Affairs
ofﬁce has spent an entire year
putting this weekend celebration
together, with the help of Facili-
ties Management, the Develop-
ment Ofﬁce, Dining Services,
various academic departments,
and of course, W&L students.
Each year, W&L receives an
abundance of positive feedback
from parents and strives to have
the weekend run just as smooth,
if not easier, than last year’s.

According to Rice, “Parents
are easy to please, as long as they
get to spend time on campus with
their students.”

Every year 150-200 Washing-
ton and Lee students will wake
up in the health center. Accord-

place on campus they could be.
When a student is taken to the
health center, the nurse on duty

Throughout the night, they are
often checked on to be sure they
are sleeping soundly and still
breathing.

An average of 40-50 students
are sent to the emergency room
for special care before they can
return to the health center for the
rest of their night. Only one or
two cases a year require extend-
ed hospitalization.

W&L’s nurses take care of
those students who might oth-
erwise be put to bed by their
friends and expected to “sleep
it off,” just like they do at other
colleges across the nation.

According to Horton, W&L
students are great at bringing stu-
V dents in when they seem unsafe.
At other colleges, sometimes
the only options are the hospital
(where there is a fear of judicial
action) or just going to bed.

I If a student does not receive
care they might never wake up.

A few weeks ago, Radford
University sophomore Samuel
Mason, 20, was found dead in an
off-campus Tau Kappa Epsilon
house, according to the school
paper. He was a pledge of TKE,
a fraternity already on probation
for serving alcohol to minors.

Mason was seen drinking a
bottle of liquor at the fraternity
house the previous night before
being walked by friends to the
off-campus house and put to
bed.

Police found his body the

poisoning, though there have
been other alcohol-related deaths
in the University’s history.

The last time alcohol played
a role in student deaths was a
drunk driving accident in Octo-
ber of 2000, when two students,
Adam Burchett, 20, and Kristin
Shelton, 18, lost control of their
SUV homecoming weekend and
ﬂipped over on the highway sev-
eral times. The trees on the right
side of the GBD quad are in their
memory.

The student health center
is one of the reasons W&L has
been able to avoid alcohol-re-
lated deaths. Judicial action is
not brought against students that
spend the night in the health cen-
ter. While it has always served
this purpose unofficially, a task

can be brought into the health
center at any time of night, free
of charge and free from worry
about legal or university conse-
quences. “If assistance is needed,
it shouldn’t be denied,” said Hor-
ton.

Horton said that some schools
are not as understanding as
W&L. These schools’ health
centers may turn away intoxi-
cated students, saying “we do
not do that.”

For example, the Radford
University health center is open
until 6 p.m. on Friday, and does
not reopen until 8:30 a.m. Mon-
day morning, according to their
webpage. While they do have a
24-hour emergency call line stu-
dents can access, it’s a far cry
from W&L’s overnight health

According to Horton, chang-
ing times have made it more dif-
ﬁcult for college students to be
safe. Binge drinking is a new is-
sue that simply wasn’t a problem
decades ago. Women are keeping
up with men, going shot for shot
and drink for drink. Men have
discovered alcohol energy drinks
like Four Loko, which contain
5-6 standard drinks in one con-
tainer. The “energy” components
like taurine and guarana, combat
the effects of alcohol, allowing
consumers to drink more without
feeling as poorly.

All of these factors caused
October to be the record month
for the health center: 55 students
were treated, thehighest num-
ber in its history. September was
also very high. Horton believes

The Alcohol Task Force was

Its purpose was to ﬁnd ways to

W&L, after ten alcohol-related

Book club turns
the pages back

Page Turners, a new club at W&L, reads lighthearted
children 3* books to destress students

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

The newest club on campus
aims to put some fun back into
the art of reading—fun that can
be lost during long nights of
reading nothing but textbook af-
ter textbook.

Sophomore Cassie McGinty,
founder of Page Turners, said she
hopes to help members “return to
the roots of reading” by delving
into exciting books.

McGinty said she started
Page Turners because she be-
lieves that despite how academi-
cally successful students are at
W&L, they don’t do enough ﬁin
reading.

McGinty chose works for the
club that she hopes will attract a
variety of people. She said that
she selected works that would
“challenge assumptions” that

people might have, for instance,
about fantasy novels or about
the value of reading a children’s
book when you are 20 years old.

The club will read
works from several
different genres and
meet biweekly to
share their thoughts.

The ﬁrst book that
the club will be read-
ing and discussing
is a children’s novel
entitled Inkheart.

McGinty selected
Inkheart as the ﬁrst
work for the club
because she thought
that reading a chil-
dren’s book during
midterms would put
the least amount of
stress upon members
of the club.

Page Turners will meet some-
time next week to discuss the ﬁrst
several chapters of Inkheart, but
it is not too late for new members
to join the club and get in on the
discussion.

 

Used copies of Inkheart are
available for purchase at a dis-
counted price in the University
Bookstore.

An interview with the chief of the Lexington Police force

The Police Chief discusses the community policing, noise violations, and Washington & Lee students

Editor is! note.‘ Usually, we would run this in the News section, but as it is a follow-up to other opinions articles, we decided to run it the Opinions section.

Bylon Salm
STAFF WRITER

Earlier this week, I sat down
with Alfred S. Thomas, Lexing-
ton’s Chief of Police.

Despite having only been
Chief of Police for the past six
months, Thomas has a ﬁrm grasp
on life in Lexington and how his
department can help improve it.

During our conversation,
Thomas spoke about the con-
cept of community policing and
how he has introduced it to his
ofﬁcers in order to increase com-
munication within the Lexington
community. ‘

Thomas also responded to a
number of criticisms of his de-
partment, including a response to
the “War on Noise” that has seen '
parties shut down earlier and ear-
lier this year.

Ring-Tum Phi: Tell us about
yourself. How did you end up in
Lexington?

Chief Thomas: I’ve been
here for about six months. I was
appointed Chief of Police in Lex-
ington back in April of this year. I
started my career with the Lynch-
burg Police Department. I was in
Lynchburg for over twenty years
and had a number of assignments
during my career there. I attained
the rank of captain, worked as a
patrol captain, the IA [internal af-
fairs] commander for a stint and
also served as a staff captain.

Phi: After entering the police
department, what have you want-
ed to change about it? Is there
anything particular to Lexington
you have wanted to change?

Thomas: One promise I made
the employees here in Lexington
when I ﬁrst arrived was that I am
not going to come in and try to
turn this agency upside down
with changes. I am not going to
try to make this the Lynchburg
Police Department. We will
move slow and deliberate to ﬁnd

out what works here. We will
custom ﬁt the changes towards
Lexington PD. We will not make
changes just to make changes.
It turns out I was wrong, I have
made a lot more changes than
I thought I would make so far.
When problems arise and if I see
an opportunity to do something
better, then we’ll make change.
We’ve made a number of changes
in the last six months, more than
I anticipated. Not changes be-
cause there were major problems
— that is one of the reasons why
I came to this city. This wasn’t a
police department that needed a
culture change. We weren’t hav-
ing problems with ofﬁcers doing
anything rimmoral, unethical or
illegal. But I saw opportunities
to see the department run a bit
more eﬂiciently. I am a huge pro-
ponent of community policing. I
saw an opportunity to take that to
a new level with the talented of-
ﬁcers we have here.

Phi: Can you tell us a little
more about the idea of commu-
nity policing?

Thomas: Absolutely. The
essence of community policing
is partnerships with the com-
munity. Let me preface that by
saying something about the 911
phone system. We made a prom-
ise to the community — if you
dial 911 a policeman will show
up and solve all your problems.
We started to really have that
mindset. Call us; we’re the ex-
perts; we’ll solve your problems
for you and we’ll leave. What we
have discovered over time is that
we are not always the experts.
We don’t always know what all
the problems are and we can’t
solve all your problems. That’s
when community policing really
started to really take hold. Police
started working more as a part-

ner with the community and with
other city government employ-
ees to truly identify, prioritize
and problem solve.‘

Phi: How has community po-
licing come to affect Lexington?

Thomas: There are a num-
ber of programs. Because we
are a small city, that can be good
and that can be bad. Everybody
knows everybody, which is great.
But what I’m ﬁnding is that al-
though we’re small, there is still
sometimes a disconnect. I’ve
seen a number of civic groups
that are all doing good work in
this community, but I’m not sure
they always communicate with
each other. Sometimes you can
have different groups working
on very similar projects that are
not combining or pooling their
resources to become more effec-
tive. That’s where the police can
come in. If were reaching out
and partnering with all the civic
groups that we can, if were going
to community watch meetings, if
were talking to people, we can
be that conduit. We can be the
communication between all the
groups in the city. Especially in a
smaller community, I think that it
is important. You just automati-
cally assume that we all know
everything that is going on in this
area, and we don’t.

Phi: How do you feel you can
help 'Washington and Lee stu-
dents or Virginia Military Insti-
tute students?

Thomas: Well, I don’t really
distinguish between the commu-
nity and W&L students or VMI
students. You are all part of the
community the way I see it. The
students at VMI and the students
at W&L live here. You need to
have ownership in this commu-
nity and that’s how we treat the
students — you are members of

be treated any differently. You
should have a voice in your com-
munity and be involved in your
community. I know for a fact
that students are very involved.
I gave a speech at the Lexing-
ton Women’s Club and I com-
mended the students, particu-
Iarly at W&L, because of how
involved they are. Students have
more stress now that ever before.
They are doing so much more
and so much more is expected.
But there is still a sense of com-
munity, a sense of service. I am
seeing more and more of that and
I am so impressed. I told the la-
dies at the Women’s Club about
my daughter. She is a 13 year
old at Lylbum Downing Middle
School. One thing that she is
excited about is that W&L girls
go to the school every week and

how important that is. My mid-

STAFF WRITER

The best idea occurred to me
last Wednesday night when a
couple of friends and I went to a
rock concert at the University of
Virginia.

Think about this: driving
your car somewhere and being
able to park it. SAFELY. Iknow
this idea seems a little crazy, par-
ticularly in Lexington.

Lexington is the city where
you can go somewhere for only
two hours at a time. It’s great on
days when you have 3+ hours of
class in a row to attend, and even
better on days when you forget
your car is in two-hour parking.

It is just the best feeling ever
when you stroll back to your car
after a hard day of work and ﬁnd
that shiny green parking viola-
tion on your windshield.

I LOVE paying ﬁfteen dollars
to the City of Lexington, almost

says, “Dad, I can talk to them
about life problems, what its like
to go to high school, what its
like to go to college and we just
talk about life in general.” These
are things that I can’t talk to her
about. She has students who can,
who come in and do that on their
own. I think that is invaluable.
There are programs and things
that students do in our commu-
nity that you don’t get credit for.
Its fun to talk about noise com-
plains and shutting parties down
because that sells papers. I really
don’t think students do a good
job of talking about your com-
munity involvement and all the
important things you do in our
neighborhood. I think you sell
yourselves short, quite honestly.

Phi: You seem to have quite

the positive image of W&L stu-
dents. What about any negative
things you have seen from stu-
dents? .
Thomas: Well, there is one
negative. lt’s not that unusual.
I ’ve seen students make some
poor decisions related to alcohol.
Whether it is underage drinking,
underage possession of alcohol
or excessive drinking, I have seen
some students make some very
poor decisions in that area. Al-
cohol alfects people differently. I
am concerned when I see people
who are drinking in excess leave
a party and are walking alone. I
know we live in a safe city, and I
am proud that this is a safe city.
But you are more likely to be a
victim if you are not using your
faculties, if you are inebriated to
a point where you are not aware
of your surroundings. It is dan-
gerous, and I think that is a prob-
lem. I have seen students leaving
parties walking across the street
laughing and talking, not a care
in the world. They don’t even see
cars driving around. They don’t
pay attention to traffic concerns.
But I will say that I don’t see as
much of that as I used to see in
Lynchburg. It is still problemat-
ic, but what I do see a lot of here
is that people tend to walk in
groups. I think that girls are do-
ing a betterjob of looking out for
each other. I think the male stu-
dents need to step up. If they see
a female or two females by them-
selves and they are walking back
at midnight, they need to escort
them home. Chivalry is not dead.
We are still in the South.

Phi: The W&L community,
especially students, has the per-
ception that the police depart-
ment is out to get them. That of-
ﬁcers want to arrest them, to give
them speeding tickets, violations
and citations in order to increase
department revenue. How do you
respond to this criticism?

Thomas: I would say that is
just the opinion of a few. Over-
all,-the students I’ve met with
and talked to are very intelligent.

as much as I love typing words
in all-caps to accentuate my ar-
guments. ‘

Now, here comes the sob sto-
ry. Have no fear for I have hired
my own violinist to follow me
around. Just this year already, I
have received three parking vio-
lations.

The ﬁrst one I deserved be-
cause I forgot my car was in two
hour parking and left it there all
day.

The second one, I was parked
for about two hours and four min-
utes. That guy was just WAIT-
ING for me.

For the third ticket, I got a
little too cute and thought I could
beat the system.

There is a brick parking lot
below Lee Chapel that is labeled,
“visitor parking”. Apparently

V this is not the case.

They want to learn. They want
to know why things are done the
way they are done. I think that is
the majority of the student base.
There are two sides to every
story. When I met with the IFC
a couple of weeks ago, I asked
them how many noise permits
they thought were issued per year.
The answers ranged from 50 to
100 to 200. We issue in excess of
100. Then I asked how many vio-

' lations they thought were issued

on average each year. I got ev-

. erything from 20 to 50 to 70. The

fact of the matter is that this year,
we have issued four summonses.
I am not sure that is all W&L. It
may not be any W&L. We don’t
distinguish between W&L, VMI
and the community. Last year, for
the entire year, we issued ﬁve. I
don’t like to argue with some-
one over their opinion. Everyone
is entitled to their opinion. I do
like to engage folks in intelligent
discussion. Let’s talk about what
really happens. This community
is very tolerant of students hav-
ing social activities. We don’t
go to parties unless we receive a
complaint from the community.
If there is no complaint, we don’t
respond unless we need to. If we
respond to a complaint, then we
issue a warning. We let students
know that it is time to lower the
noise, control the crowd. If we
get a second complaint, then we
can make a decision whether or
not to take enforcement action.

Phi: How much do you work
with the W&L administration?

Thomas: I interact on a regu-
lar basis with W&L ofﬁcials,
primarily with public safety of-
ﬁcials, but also with the Dean
of Students. We talk whenever
necessary. We have an excellent
relationship to the point where
I feel comfortable contacting
them any time I have a problem.
Believe me, they do the same.
When they hear complaints and
concerns from students, they
pick the phone up and call us.
We’ll either talk on the phone,
email, or if it’s serious, have a
face-to-face meeting. That’s the
best way to work out your prob-
lems. Sit right across from each
other and talk about it.

Phi: Have you spoken with
Dean Watkins concerning a re-
cent article published in the
Ring-Tum Phi? It introduced the
“War on Noise” ~ the fact that
parties have been getting shut
down earlier and earlier com-
pared to earlier years.

Thomas: Yes, Dean Watkins
sent Mike Young [W&L direc-
tor of public safety] over here
to have a face-to-face discussion
with me about that incident. For-
tunately, the deputy Chief of P0-
lice was actually there that night
the party was shut down. I credit
Dean Watkins and Mike Young.
They wanted to know ﬁrsthand.

I purposely did .not register
my vehicle with the school be-
cause I knew that where I live is
too close to campus to utilize the
parking deck.

If I am not going to get any
utility out of registering my car,
why pay the registration fee? So
here is where the trickery comes
in to play.

One day I decide to park in
the Lee Chapel parking lot for
thirty minutes so that I can run
into the Beta fraternity house to
get a quick bite to eat. My vehi-
cle could have been any random
alumnus’, a recruit’s, a prospec-
tive student’s, etc.

Yet, after my totally‘ killer
lunch (it was fajita day), I had
a fat ticket sitting on my wind-
shield and a light bulb hovering
above my head in the form of a
great idea.

Before they jumped to any con-
clusions, they wanted to know
the facts.

.Phi: How would you have a
party operate if you were a part
of the W&L administration?

Thomas: I think something
is working. If we’re having well
over 100 parties in this small
town every year and there are
only four or ﬁve violations, I
think something is working,
don’t you? If we were having
150 parties and 100 violations, if
people were being arrested, if we
were shutting parties down, then
I’d say we have a serious prob-
lem. What we’re lacking now is
communication and planning. I
think that the students being held
accountable should have a plan
if a neighbor feels that a party is
too loud and calls the police. You
can’t plan that at ll:30 the night
of a party. If you are planning a
party and you have a week’s no-
tice, you need to have a plan to
make sure the party stays under
control. That’s an opportunity
where students can do a better
job. Do I have a plan? Can I shut
the music down lower? Can we
have a tent erected? It surprises
me how much a tent really helps
with the sound. We encourage
the students to go out and talk to
the neighbors. It’s important to
be good neighbors. Talk to the
people who live in the area and
let them know. There is a lot of
planning that can be done on the
students’ part. If students have
concerns, then I encourage them
to come sit down and talk to us.
Come meet with the police de-
partment. We want everyone to
have a good time and be safe.
Phi: The W&L administra-
tion has strongly encouraged
on-campus social events, such
as those in fraternity houses, to
those off-campus at Windfall or
the Pole Houses. Do you have a
preference to as where students
go when they go out?
Thomas: I don’t necessar-
ily have a preference. I have no
authority to say where a party
should take place. I know there
is a lot of talk now about bring-
ing parties back to the city. We
don’t have many alcohol-related
arrests right now in the city. I
know folks won’t believe that
[we do], but we really don’t have
very many. The more parties, the
more those numbers will go up.
It’s a numbers game. When par-
ties are in town, we don’t have
students operating motor vehi-
cles. lt’s one thing to be walking
on the street when you’ve had
too much to drink. You might
become a victim. You might put
yourself in danger. If you operate
a motor vehicle, you put every-
one around you in danger.

Cars beware; they are out to get you

Lex Appeal: Helping prospective students choose W&L

After suﬂering bad experiences herself Campbell Burr explains the do is and don ’t for hosting a prospective student

By Campbell Burr
STAFF WRITER

Despite the countless plane
rides, road trips, hotel stays, in-
formation sessions and tours that
made up my college search, it
was ultimately Washington and
Lee Parents’ Weekend that left
the strongest impression.

Parents of younger siblings,
be forewarned: come Sunday,
your second child will want to be
a General, too.

Some thoughts that crossed
my mind over my inaugural Par-
ent’s Weekend:

Are all applicants required to
submit a headshot?

Why is everyone going to the
football game in every color but
royal blue and white?

Is shag/swing dancing a pre-

requisite for admission?

Overnight visits can make or
break an applicant’s view of a
school. My visits to W&L have
been wonderful, but I’ve had less
pleasant experiences at other uni-
Versities.

A word to anyone hosting a
prospective student: you have
the power to make or break his
or her view of your school. Here
are some pointers...

1. Do not drink too much.

My overnight visit to a Vir-
ginia state school would have
been awesome if I hadn’t spent
the entire night making sure my
host didn’t pass out.

I expected that she would take
it easy and look out for me, as I

The night began with her
having a cocktail (or three) in
her room. She told me that most
nights she ended up “blacking
out somewhere.” That made me
feel good.

We headed to a pregame
down the street. My host walked
in, headed to the bar, and downed
a strong mixed drink.

Before I could say “Gucci,”
she was wasted. She couldn’t
even stand up without putting a
death grip on my shoulder.

When I tried to mingle with
the other students, she followed
me, clasped her hands around
the neck of the nearest boy and
passed out against his chest. At-
tractive.

At one point, my host started
laughing so hard that she fell
onto her back and began rolling
back and forth on the ﬂoor, mum-
bling something indecipherable.
People were staring at her. I ran
over to pull her up. She preferred
the ground.

prospective with the amount of

go.
During my college visits, I re-
alized that the nerdier the reputa-
tion ofa school, the more its stu-
dents bragged about “how hard
they partied” and the more they

pretended that they didn’t work
or care about school.

At one school it seemed as
if everyone I met was obsessed
with destroying his nerdy high
school reputation, despite the
fact he was attending the world’s
most prestigious university.

As I prepared to head off to a
big football game with my host at
an Ivy League school, I met some
boys determined to convince me
that their weekends involved se-
rious binge drinking.

The moment I walked into
one eating club to meet my host’s
friends, one of them handed me a
beer. Not in the genuine, consid-
erate, “this girl might be thirsty”
kind of way. It was more of an” I

I am because I can give her alco-

I considered taking a sip then
spitting it out, “Ew, this tastes
weird!” orjust refusing it, “Mom
would kill me.”

I decided not to accept the
beer. The girl I was with laughed.
“No! Do not start corrupting her
already!” I wanted to remind her
that I actually had a social life
in high school. I probably came
across as awkward and uncom-
fortable, even though I was nei-
ther.

Shortly after another boy
walked into the room holding a
backpack. My guest introduced

Before I could ﬁnish the “nice
to meet you,” he unzipped his
bag to show off the “goods” for
the game.

He described every‘ drink in
his bag, while nodding his head
and laughing about how sick the
day would be. This scene was
faintly reminiscent of a l6-year-
old bragging about raiding his
parents’ liquor cabinet.

and had no way of letting myself
into her locked apartment. To
make matters worse, my phone
was on low battery.

I didn’t know if she had al-
ready gone to the bars down
the street or if she was in one
of the apartme ‘s with her new
“friend.” .

I decided to take a risk and
head downtown. I felt more com-
fortable being in an area that was
populated.

As if that wasn’t bad enough,
later on that night, she left me
in her apartment to go make out
with the boy.

Whatever. At least I got the
bed to myself for part of the
night.

The main point here is to be
a responsible host and don’t act
too cool for school.

ents’ Weekend. W&L students

Most of you are probably hor-
riﬁed to think that a host would
actually leave a high school stu-
dent alone on a college campus
to go hook up with someone. Un-
fortunately, it happened to me.

The same drunk girl at the
Virginia state school told me that
she would wait for me outside
of an apartment complex with
the boy she had been leaning on
before while I went to get some-
thing from my car.

When I came back ten minutes
later, she was gone. I tried calling
her. No answer. And again. Still
no answer.

I kept calling her. Still no
answer. And then, I felt it com-

sob, and then as people probably
started wondering, “Who is the
random girl shivering and crying
on a street corner?” My phone
began to ring! My host was call-
ing.

She said she would meet me
outside the bars in a second. She
had been in one of the apartments

voice. It was too much to take.

The GOP gains in the midterm elections are overshadowed by a rise in independent presence among voters

’. By John Paul Beall

STAFF WRITER

The midterm elections are
ﬁnally over, and they were cer-
tainly interesting to watch. The
political landscape has greatly
changed. In other words, this
election was explosive.

onslaught; and the govemorship

consolation for Democrats dur-

in the House is 186 Democrats

The GOP can cheer that Nan-

Speaker of the House, and major

For the Senate, the gap has
been closed. There will be 52
Democrats in the ll2th Senate
and 46 Republicans, with two
races too close to call.

One of those races is the three-
way race in Alaska, in which in-

ensuring that seat will stay in Re-

For governors’ races, there are
15 Democrats, 29 Republicans, 1
independent (from Rhode Island)
and 5 still undecided.

Perhaps today it is inappropri-
ate to just analyze things in terms
of blue and red, because the real

action in the election took place
with third-party candidates, per-

has some fundamental changes
coming to it.

Other races have also seen
independents take charge. Con-
sider the race for governor of
Colorado, which saw a Republi-

claim many more votes than the
GOP-endorsed candidate.

F lorida’s Senate race saw ex-
Republican Charlie Crist run as
an independent and pick up more
votes than the Democrat, as GOP
candidate Marco Rubio picked
up almost the entire Republican
base.

Also, New England saw a
fundamental change in this re-
spect as well. In the Maine race
for governor, the Republican
topping the polls had an Inde-
pendent nipping at his heels, and
in Rhode Island, an Independent

system still has enough integrity
to be the dominant force in our
nation’s elections, a non—aligned
movement is picking up speed.

While this election posted
great gains for the GOP and the
Democrats’ power base is large-
ly intact, the old-time oddity of
having an independent such as
Lieberman is becoming more
of a commonality, which speaks
loudly‘ to the change in our coun-
try’s voting habits.

It could either mean that dis-
satisfaction with gridlock has
rendered a need for a third per-
spective, which would mean that
people are largely looking at the
virtues of each candidate (which
would explain some of occur-
rences like the Senate race in
Delaware).

The corollary ofthis indicates
that this movement is positive re-
flection on voters, who are gener-
ally accused ofvoting by party.

Furthermore, the rise in inde-
pendent voting could be a tempo-

rary phenomenon that will recur
as long as the two—party system
is destabilized though partisan-
ship.

On the other hand, it could
be a reflection of the decline of
the party system and its loosen-
ing monopoly on the political
system, which may not be such a
temporary occurrence.

So now that the system has
returned to balance, all politi-
cians must tread carefully. Any
more gridlock could lead to the
dissolution of the political es-
tablishment under two parties, a
system that has given our coun-
try strength in the past.

To paraphrase Benjamin
Franklin, Republicans and
Democrats must hang together
or together they will each hang
separately, as independents are
setting vital precedent with every
move.

This is the inflection point
from which the great change
promised will come.

  How the Democrats lost the midterm elections so badly

Looking back on the successes and failures of the last Congress and what to look for in the next two years

By Summer Lollie
STAFF WRITER

As I watched the midterm
elections come in on Tuesday
night, I’ll admit, I shed a tear or
two, yelled, screamed and possi-
bly threw a few things.

While the Democrats did
manage to retain control ‘of the
Senate (thank you, Tea Party),
the Democrats lost control of the
House of Representatives in a
devastating fashion, leaving me
wondering how we got to this
point.

The Democrats were always
poised to lose seats in both
chambers. In Congress, the party
in power will almost always lose
seats during mid-terrn elections.
Also, the party in power will
most assuredly lose seats if the
economy is down and unemploy-
ment is up.

The Democratic-controlled
111th Congress started their ses-
sion facing the worst economic
downturn since the Great De-
pression and was faced with near
double-digit unemployment ﬁg-
ures.

It is unsurprising that the exit
polls found that almost 9 out of
10 people thought the economy
was in bad shape, and, despite the
fact that the majority of Ameri-
cans still believe that George
Bush and Republican policies
got us into the mess, the Ameri-
can people blamed the party in
power for not ﬁxing it.

However, Democrats can-
not come out of the loss simply
blaming the economy. The Dem-
ocratsplayed a role in their own
defeat.

President Obama and Con-
gressional Democrats had con-

trol of both houses and the presi-
dency, yet decided to play footsie
with a Republican Party that was
determined to be the party of
“no” from the very beginning.
The Republican Party played

except to send a few annoying
videos and encourage people to
hold “Healthcare Parties.”
Instead of mobilizing the
base, the Democratic Party did
the opposite; they demobilized it

as many troops to Afghanistan,
and continued and expanded the
Bush/Cheney national security
policies.

How much more centrist
could Obama and Congressional

Now, the Republicans have to deal with a fractious party as they ﬁgure

out who the hell these Tea Party candidates are and what they want.

Republicans will quickly discover what they learned in 1994 — that it is

much easier to talk than to govern.

the obstructionist legislation af-I
ter legislation with the goal of
gridlock.

Democrats could not swal-
low the fact that the Republican
Party was not going to come to
the middle and work with them.

In 2008, the people gave
President Obama and Congres-
sional Democrats a mandate, and
instead of using that mandate to
govern, they gave the public tep-
id legislation in the name of bi-
partisanship that was never really
going to come. The Republicans
were dead set to block anything
the Democrats put out.

And what happened to the co-
alition that Obama and the Dem-
ocrats built in 2008, anyway?

President Obama’s presiden-
tial run left the Democrats one of
the strongest voter mobilization
networks this nation has seen,
promising to keep the voters en-
gaged as they governed.

Yet, until the upcoming days
of -the election, the Democrats
did not use their Organizing For
America network for two years

by chasing after the Republicans
and ignoring their base.

It didn’t help any when Rahm
Emmanuel called the Demo-
cratic base “t"‘*king retards”.
One should not bite the hand that
feeds them and then expect more
snacks.

However, do not believe the
things you will hear following
the election. President Obama
and Congressional Democrats
did not overreach. The TARP
(bank bailout) was Bush’s baby.
The stimulus package, deemed
too small anyway, was needed to
stave off the economic downturn
the Bush policies created, and
the ﬁnancial regulations bill was
deemed insuﬁicient by the ma-
jority of Americans.

Do not believe that this elec-
tion loss meant that Obama and
Congressional Democrats should
have moved more toward the
center.

He was always in the center.
He cut taxes, passed Mitt Rom-
ney’s healthcare plan, opened
off-shore drilling, sent twice

Democrats be?

In fact, it was the Blue Dog
Democrats who took the most
losses. While unfortunate for
those needing Democratic rep-
resentation in purple states, Blue
Dogs chose to act like Republi-
cans and thus shot themselves in
the foot.

Trying to imitate a Republi-
can will not bring you votes, es-
pecially if voters can pick a real
Republican.

Do not believe that this elec-
tion is a vindication of ‘conser-
vative philosophy. Demoralized
Obama voters stayed at home,
and non-aligned independents
defected, voting against a lousy
economy—they voted for perfor-
mance rather than ideology.

Democrats did do a lot: passed
ﬁnancial reform law that prohib-
ited banks from engaging in pro-
prietary trading and established a
Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau to look out for the inter-
ests of everyday Americans.

Democrats passed the health-
care reform bill, preventing in-

surance companies from denying
insurance because of a pre-exist-
ing conditions, cut prescription
drug cost for Medicare recipi-
ehts by 50%, extended beneﬁts
to same-sex partners of federal
employees, passed the Ameri-
can Recovery & Reinvestment
Act of 2009: a $789 billion eco-
nomic stimulus plan and signed
the Children’s Health Insurance
Reauthorization Act, which pro-
vides health care to 11 million
kids - 4 million of whom were
previously uninsured. They
also signiﬁcantly expanded Pell
grants, which help low-income
students pay for college. The list
goes on and on.

On a side note, I would like
to say that one of the biggest ca-
sualties of Tuesday night (setting
aside Prop. 19) is that Nancy Pe-
losi will no longer be Speaker of
the House.

Speaker Pelosi walked lock-
step, synchronized with President
Obama and ALWAYS got the
votes. The House was dispropor-
tionally blamed for the Senate’s
failures. Nancy Pelosi didn’t de-
serve this. Harry Reid did, yet it
was Pelosi who lost her job.

Where, you ask, does all of
this lead us? Well, more grid-
lock, that’s for sure.

Keep a lookout for Boehner
and Cantor calling to shut the
government down.

Watch out for moves to put
Wall Street in charge of Social
Security and insurance compa-
nies in charge of Medicare, and
get ready for the ridiculous use of
Congressional time and money as
the Republicans try to “investi-

gate” the Obama administration.
For Republicans, the NoBama
policy stopped Tuesday.

Now, the Republicans have
to deal with a fractious party as
they ﬁgure out who the hell these
tea party candidates are and what
they want.

Republicans will quickly
discover what they learned in
l994—that it is much easier to
talk than to govern. Republican
policies got us into this mess;
let’s see if their policies can get
us out of it. -

President Obama does have
one advantage: he is one voice
against the babble of Republican
and Tea Party voices.

This is the time when Presi-
dent Obama and Congressional
Democrats can make the differ-
ences between Democrats and
Republicans very clear.

This is not the time to appease
Republicans. Stand your ground,
President Obama.

Truman stood his ground,.
Reagan stood his ground. Now
it is time for President Obama to
stand his ground and stay true to
the principles he campaigned on
to get elected.

As the Republicans struggle
to bring their caucus together,
improve the economy and create
jobs while beholden to the busi-
ness interests that funded their
campaigns, the Democrats need
to let it be known that they are
a party of political courage, not
political contributions.

Democrats need to regain their
voice as the party for the people
by the people and remember who
and what they are ﬁghting for.

The trouble with rooting for both Donkeys and Cowboys

As his beloved Dallas Cowboys and Democratic Party take their seats in the cellar, Stockton Bullitt laments on the loss

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

I’m a Democrat and a fan of

I the Dallas Cowboys, so this re-

ally hasn’t been the ideal autumn
for me.

I’ve had the joy of listening to
Sean Hannity call Barack Obama
racist against black people, and
even worse, I’ve had to remind
a friend of mine who is a Giants
fan that Jon Kitna was a washed
up quarterback for the Lions
three years ago!

I really wanted to make this
article a giant pity party for me.
Oh, how difficult my life is: Re-
publicans kicked the Democrats’
ass this past Tuesday almost as
badly as the Jaguars (reminder:
Jacksonville is a city in the Unit-
ed States, albeit an irrelevant
one, and it does have a football
team) dismantled the Cowboys
in their own stadium.

Did I mention my best fantasy
football player is Peyton Hillis?

But the more I think about it,
the happier I am about this situ-
ation. Being a Democrat and a
Cowboys fan hasn’t really been
that easy since early 2009. This
school is ﬁlled with Republican
fans of every other team in the
NFC East, so it’s not like the
daily taunting I get is new to me.

Plus, for the last three years,
the head coach of my favorite
football team and the Congres-
sional speaker for my party have
been Wade Phillips and Nancy
Pelosi.

Are you serious?

With the unemployment rate
hovering around 9%, it is noth-
ing short of a crime that these
two strangely similar individuals
have been getting a generous sal-
ary for a combined seven years.

Every time either one of their
faces ﬁashes on the TV screen, I
have to ﬁght the insatiable urge
to throw something. And I’m the
one who’s supposed to root for

these guys.

By the way, Republicans,
wipe that smile off your face. Re-
member, Michael Steele, a.k.a.
Brad Childress, is still the head
of your party.

Yes, this is a time of cleansing
for both the Democrats and the

Dallas Cowboys.

I can ﬁnally sit back and put
all my chips on Obama like I
wanted to do from day one of
his presidency, and I no longer
have to wait until early January
for Tony Romo to treat my hopes
and dreams like his own personal
Jessica Simpson.

I am in the position I was
used to growing up: watching the
“Daily Show” for clips of blatant
Republican lying and reading
Mel Kiper Jr. for his thoughts
on early draft picks of defensive
backs (I’m preordering my Cow-
boy Prince Amukamara jersey as
we speak).

Moving forward, this apoca-
lyptic week could not be better
for the long term future of both
my party and my team.

The Cowboys are ﬁnally go-
ing to get themselves rid them-
selves of Jason Garrett and Wade
Phillips, who proved to be as in-
telligent under pressure as W&L
students on Windfall once the
cops show up.

Plus, Dallas leads the league
in attendance and has the most
money, so it’s not like they are
the Cavaliers and won’t be good
for another quarter of a century
or so. Sorry, Cleveland, at least
you have Eric Mangini to look
forward to.

My certainty in the Demo-
crats is a little more complicated
to explain.

For starters, is having a Dem-
ocratic President and a Repub-
lican Congress all that bad for
anybody?

The last time we had it, 1994,
led to a pretty sweet six ‘years in
America. The economy was good
and the biggest foreign policy
issue was a war in Kosovo that
mattered inﬁnitely less to Ameri-
cans than Kurt Cobain’s death
and Hanson’s new album.

For the last two years, I’ve
had to constantly hear about how
evil and idiotic Democrats were.

I had the pleasure of listen-
ing to extended tirades about
the similarities between Barack
Obama and Vladimir Lenin.

So, Republicans, you got
what you wanted. I look forward
to seeing the fruition of all this
proposed change that I keep see-
ing in commercials. __

You say that you are going to
ﬁx the way Washington is run,

Remember the wonderful job
you did with responsibly coming
out of the 2001 recession, con-
trolling government spending
from 2000-2008, and getting out
of wars during the Bush admin-
istration?

Oh, you’re over that now.
Well, have fun ignoring the Tea
Partiers and leftover neo-cons
in your own party now that you
have the power back.

More importantly, let’s say
you are who every single Repub-
lican here says he or she is: “Lib-
ertarians” with a little Reagan
thrown in there.

In other words, you ﬁnd ways
to drastically cut down on gov-
ernment spending without hav-
ing to resort to taxes and ﬁx this
war in Afghanistan, all the while

Republicans do works out. Then
Obama can just take credit for all
that success.

If you believe that Americans
are too smart to see that logic.
Remember they were dumb
enough to expect Obama to pay
their mortgage and Christine
O’Donnell to perform witchcraft
once elected.

Just know this, Republicans:
enjoy this election as much as
you can for the next two months.

Despite not controlling the
Senate, you are the ones with the
momentum.

You just started dating the
hot, popular chick, and right now
she’s in the honeymoon phase.

This is the time when you
break out your “NObamaCare”
t-shirts.

mg once spring rolls around.

So with my football team and
political party in disarray, I’m
looking to the future.

I’m excited for Bill Cowher
to be introduced as the new head
coach of the Dallas Cowboys.

I’m excited to see some won-
derfully stagnant Congressional
bills.

Mostly though, I’m excited
to see what you Republicans do
with this opportunity.

Yes, you guys might ﬁnd suc-
cess with all your proposed leg-
islation, and maybe you’ll even
wise up to the fact that your best
candidate for 2012 BY FAR is
Haley Barbour.

The current governor of Mis-
sissippi is the only member of
the GOP who actually scares

Oh, how diﬁicult my life is: Republicans kicked the Democrats ’ass this

Democrats, these past two years
haven’t really been the complete
failure you said it has.

Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell? Mis-
sion Accomplished.

Troops out of Iraq? You’re
welcome.

Health Care? Failed. Oh wait,
that passed? Sucks bro...

Now it’s your turn.

You think you can balance
this economy, stiﬂe government
spending, and win the war in Af-
ghanistan? Go right ahead. I’m
all ears.

somehow getting our economy
out of the toilet.

If that happens, then my life
has just been made drastically
better, and I’m perfectly ﬁne
with that scenario.

This is where Baracka Flaka
Flame‘ comes in (Barack Obama
for those who haven’t seen the
YouTube video). He’s a winner
either way this works out.

Let’s say the Republicans de-
cide to abide byvtheir “no com-
prise” slogan and don’t work
with Obama _on anything. Then,
Obama can play the helpless
president card for the 2012 elec-
tion.

And let’s say everything the

This is the time when you re-
mind Democrats about how this
is the biggest swing in the House
since 1932.

This is the time when you
go around telling everyone you
kicked out the only thing worse
than Michael Moore, a San Fran-
cisco liberal, for some guy named
Boner. . .er. . .Boehner.

Remember though, once Jan-
uary rolls around, you are going
to be the ones with the respon-
sibility.

You are going to have to
convince that hot, popular girl
why she needs to stay with you
through 2012, and let me tell you,
her eyes are going to start drift-

any Democrat, and his fund rais-
ing efforts with the Republican
Govemor’s Association have
surpassed even the RNC’s. Trust
me, the only thing stopping this
guy is_ a heart attack from his
umpteenth Wendy’s run.

But, just like I know that the
Cowboys will make the playoff
in 2011, I know that Republicans
won’t ride off into the sunset that
easily.

I know that Sarah Palin or
Mitt Romney will ﬁnd some way
to get back into the presidential

eﬂ°ort to stay in touch with his
roots. The sophomore has been
involved with the team since the
pre-season of his freshman year
and has continued to be an inte-
gral member.

. The Screaming Minks have a
long-standing history at W&L.
Established in 1966, the team
has traveled all over the country
to compete. The Minks are cur-
rently in the midst of their fall
season and will have another
season in the spring. The rugby
team is part of Campus Activities
and Recreation and is coached by
Tom Lovell and John Welsh.

As a continuation to the'Cam—
pus Recreation Spotlight series,
Tuwi agreed to answer questions
about the team and his involve-
ment in it.

Phi: How long have you
played rugby? .

Tuwi: I have played rugby
ever since I can remember. In
Fiji primary school rugby is di-
vided into four grades namely
A’s, B’s and C’s and D’s. D’s are
grades 1 and 2, C’s are 3 and 4
up until A’s which encompass the
upper grades of primary school,
I guess it would be termed mid-

dle school here. In Form 3, I
switched to soccer but promptly
switched back the year after that.
After that it has been all rugby up
until this point.

Phi: What is your favorite as-
pect of playing rugby at W&L?

Tuwi: I really like the com-
radeship between the players,
themselves and with the coaches.
I’m used to a cutthroat competi-
tive environment if I wanted to
play for the starting 15 or the
starting 7. Here it is more re-
laxed and friendly and really
allows me to just enjoy playing
with friends.

Phi: Do you have a favorite A

memory or story that took place
during a rugby match, practice,
etc.?

Tuwi:
memory last year was that of
Vos David, Law Exchange stu-
dent last year, and [sophomore]
Miguel Garza I3’. Vos would
put in a perfect cross the ﬁeld
kick and Miguel would have the
sheerspeed, balance and timing
to score time after time. This
season so far [sophomore] John
Hale’s kicking game has been
quite impressive. Of course off
the ﬁeld, it is having dinner with
Coach John and his family and
especially being entertained by
his son JP.

Phi: How much time do you

My favorite rugby ,

put into the Rugby Club?

Tuwi: Basically it is just two
hours every Tuesday, Thursday
and Friday and usually the whole
of Saturday, too.

brute force, loads of injuries and
a lack of elegance. However, it
all comes down to preparation,
not unlike any other sport. In
fact once a team starts getting to-

because that deﬁnitely played a
role. It also helped that friends
were already here namely [ju-
nior] Raisa Velasco and [senior]
Anitesh Lal.

  

comments that you would like to

Tuwi Rokodulu takes to the rugby field at the beginning of the match on a gorgeous fall Saturday.

Phi: Is there anything about
the rugby team that you would
like the campus to know about?

Tuwi: Other than the fact that
we still need people to come out,
not really, no. But on a more se-
rious note I think rugby has the
misconception that it isjust sheer

gether, it is uniquely elegant and
makes for a good watch. -

Phi: Why did you choose to
come to W&L?

Tuwi: It was a variety of fac-
tors, chiefly among them the
Honor system. I would be re-
miss to blot out rugby here, too,

Phi: What is your favorite as-
pect of W&L?

Tuwi: The small classes
would have to be it and the easy
relation to the professors. Other
than that it would have to be my
friends.

Phi: Do you have any other

coming out to support the team.
Also to those of you who buy
rugby tee’s, thanks, as well. Ku-
dos to my Host Mum and Dad

Subject of musical too dark for one student

‘Assassins ’reviewer says that the story line and music was depressing, but that the actors played their roles to a tee

By Julie Hansen
smrr wnmzn

Washington and Lee’s dq-
partments of Music, Theater and
Dance showed their portrayal of
Assassins, a musical based on
an idea by Charles Gilbert, Jr.,
with music and lyrics by Ste-
phen Sondheim; think “Sweeney
Todd.”

Before I get into the nitty—grit—
ty details, let me just warn you,
Assassins is a play you probably
shouldn’t take your grandmother
or younger sister to. There is no
want of swearing or gunﬁre; there
are rather vivid interpretations of
death and execution; and, for a
musical, there is a great deal of
long soliloquies.

The musical itself has an eerie
vibe to it, dealing with the deaths
of presidents and the thoughts
that possess people to murder a
national ﬁgure, whether the rea-
sons were for infamy, politics
or pure psychosis. Furthermore,
the anachronistic conversations
between assassins left me con-
fused; it was a break from the
historical facts and speculations

that the musical is greatly based
off of. Adding to the confusion
was the non-chronological pre-
sentation of assassinations, espe-
cially since I need to brush up on
my U.S. presidents.

In all fairness, most of my
complaints really can be blamed
on the script and my own person-
al preferences in musicals. I had
a conversation with a classmate
who saw the same showing and
he came away praising the things
I was criticizing, namely “Un-
worthy Of Your Love,” a song in
which John Hinckley, played by
freshman Yates Wilbum, and Ly-
nette “Squeaky” Fromme, played
by freshman Kaitlyn Farley,
sang to their respective muses,
Jodie Foster and Charles Man-
son. I said it felt bizarre hearing
crazy people sing to their unre-
quited loves as though they were
religious ﬁgures; he said that was
the point, he had never thought
about assassin’s reasoning’s be-
hind their actions.

Despite, what I interpreted as a

very dark musical, W&L music,
theater and dance stars shined
throughout. Senior Johnny Coyle
played a relatable, almost likable
John Wilkes Booth; that is, when
he wasn’t acting as menacing,
time-traveling instigator of more
than a centuries’ worth of assas-
sinations, which he did just as
convincingly. In fact, Booth is
the sanest assassin in the whole
show, killing the president as a
political statement against the
Civil War, rather than for an ul-
cerated stomach, like Giuseppe
Zangara, played by freshman
Raya Taylor, attempted.
Furthermore. with freshmen
comprising more than a third of
the cast, Assassins was a genuine
exhibition of new W&L talent.
Freshman Keith Trump brought
an endearing quality to the musi-
cal as he performed as the Bal-
ladeer. With an excellent voice
and stage-presence to match",
Trump helped break the ten-
sion and serve as comic relief;
especially in Charles Guiteau’s.

execution scene. While the au-
dience (well, at least I) cringed
and waited for Guiteau, played
by sophomore Tyson Janney, to
be hanged Trump came in danc-
ing along with Janney, mocking
the evangelist jack of all trades
up until his ﬁnal breath. Not to
mention, “The Ballad of Booth”
kicked off the musical’s almost
comedic view of Booth’s actions,
which was seen as more chann-
ing than derogatory.

Other new talent included
Kaitlyn Farley who, despite
playing a crazy hippie, was able
to show off her voice while sing-
ing about her equally crazy idol-
boyfriend-son of god, Charles
Manson. Also, freshman Sarah
Williams had an excellent vo-
cal presence in “Something Just
Broke,” a favorite song of mine
from the musical considering it
seemed to restore the severity of
the acts ofthose portrayed in As-
sassins.

W&L really excelled at
bringing out the humor in this

dark comedy. With her excellent
comic timing and stage presence,
junior Jeni Pritchett brought Sara
Jane Moore to life as a hilarious,
naive, crazy-mom-down-the-
street character.

And, when Assassins wasn’t
making me laugh, it was cer-
tainly giving me chills. From
the executions to the projection
of John F. Kennedy’s assassina-
tion, I was sucked into the past
and experienced ‘both what the
assassins may have felt and what
the general public may have felt.
At times, both understanding
and sympathy were felt for all of
the assassins, even the psychotic
ones like for Leon Czolgosz,
who was played heartbreakingly
genuine by senior Dave Curran.
Czolgosz was it ﬁrst-generation
Polish-American who worked in
a glass factory until the pressures
and inequalities of immigrant
overcame him. If there was any
assassin I felt the most compas-
sion for, it was Czolgosz.

While W&L Music and The-

ater did an excellent job of pre-
senting Assassins as an informa-
tive and compelling presentation
of U.S. history, ifl could have
changed one thing, it would have
been the projection screens on
the back of the stage. Though
at times they did show relevant,
heart-wrenching photos, such
as the children living in the city
slums during the late l9th centu-
ry, a lot ofthe time I found them
rather distracting. It is true that I
have a short attention span, but
also it seemed like at times it was
just a Google images search. The
action would have been more
compelling with just the bare
stage.

Despite my criticisms, Assas-
sins was an amazing musical that
left me feeling chilled and reﬂec-
tive, especially about the types
of circumstances that lead to as-
sassination attempts; It made me
want to ﬁght for equality, as well
as increase security measures ev-
erywhere.

Greeks put on a successful carnival again

Members of fraternities and sororities organize and volunteer at the Halloween Community Carnival at the YMCA

‘By Mary Helen Turnage

STAFF WRITER

Several Lexington and Rock-
bridge County families attended
the annual Halloween Commu-
nity Carnival last Saturday to
show off their costumes, play
games and win prizes. The tunes
of “The Monster Mash” and
“Thriller” played throughout the
day while children, parents and
Washington and Lee student vol-
unteers were ﬁlled with smiles
on the crisp fall afternoon.

The event is a joint effort
among the Greek men and wom-
en of W&L. The Panhellenic
Council organized and plarmed
the event, while the lnterfraterni-
ty Council (IFC) provided a large
number of volunteers and helped
cover expenses.

“This year we chose to beneﬁt
the YMCA’s Fall Membership
Drive and the event was held
in their parking lot,” said junior
Kenzie Doss, Panhellenic’s Pro-
gramming/Public Relations Ex-

ecutive and head of the carnival
this year. I

In previous years, each frater-
nity or sorority was responsible
for running a given booth, but this
year the fraternities were asked
to provide the actual games.

“A few fraternities really
went above andbeyond. Sigma
Chi made a great ‘Pin the Tail on
the Donkey’ and a few members
of Beta sacriﬁced themselves
for ‘Pie a Greek,’ which just so
happened to be the most popu-
lar game with the kids. KA was
also very enthusiastic about their
face-painting,” said Doss.

In 2004, the manager of Wal-
Mart proposed the idea to Pan-
hellenic because he thought that
Greeks might be interested in
volunteering for a community
carnival. W&L Greek organiza-
tions have participated in the
event ever since.

Local organizations also con-

tributed to the carnival. Dave’s
Produce donated 50 hay bales
and 300 pumpkins. The mission
ofthe carnival is to improve rela-
tions with the Rockbridge Com-
munity.

As a winner ofthe Gamma Phi
Beta College Panhellenic Award
in 2008, the Panhellenic Council
at W&L works hard to enhance

the Greek image on campus and 

in the Lexington area. With help
from all Greek organizations on
campus, the carnival serves as
a great way for fraternity and

sorority members to show their 

loyalty to the Rockbridge area.
i“We don’t raise money, we

don’t raise awareness, it is just

about giving to the community,”

said senior Panhellenic President , '

Sarah Merritt.

Swimming success continues

Men 3 and women is swim teams take down Transylvania, individuals have strong showing in Invitational

By Jayna Johns
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee
men’s and women’s swimming
teams both claimed strong victo-
ries in their meets against Tran-
sylvania University, in Lexington,
Ky. The teams won a combined
15 events in the process of their
sweep of the Pioneers.

The men, who are now 2-
0 early in the season, won nine
event victories to earn a total
score of 169 to Transylvania’s
91 points. The women, 1-1 on
the season, claimed wins in six
events to win by a score of 145-
116.

For the W&L men, ﬁrst-
years Philip Dishuck and Robert
Knuth led the Generals. Each
claimed victories in two indi-
vidual events. Dishuck won both
the 1000-yard freestyle and the
200-yard breaststroke, coming

in with a time of 10:50.91 and
2:26.45, respectively. Knuth
touched in ﬁrst in the 100- and
200-yard backstrokes. The ﬁrst
he did in the time of 56.40 and
the second in 2:08.52.

The men’s team included sev-
eral other individual winners.
Senior Brandon Wilder won the
200-yard butterﬂy in 2:04.11,
while a string of ﬁrst-years also
came in ﬁrst. David Ireland won
the 100-yard breaststroke at
1:02.30, Forrest Behne won the
500-yard freestyle at 5:15.67 and
Eric Shuman won the 100-yard
butterﬂy in 55.36.

One of W&L’s men’s relay
teams also came in ﬁrst. The
200-yard freestyle team, consist-
ing of ﬁrst-years Brendan Mc-
Goldrick and Matthew Hesser,
senior Dorsey Terry and junior

Brian Stirling, came in with a
time of 1:32.34.

The women also had an im-
pressive showing on Friday. Five
different swimmers came home
with ﬁrst-place individual ﬁnish-
es, and, like the men, landed one
relay team in the top spot.

Juniors Elizabeth ‘Stames
and Jocelyn Cassada claimed
event victories in the 1000-yard
freestyle and the 100-yard back-
stroke, respectively. Stames re-
corded a time of 11:17.75, and
Cassada won hers in a time of
1:02.84.

Sophomore Delaney Rolfe
ﬁnished ﬁrst in the 200-yard but-
terﬂy with a top time of 2:20.73.
Fellow sophomore Ann Mc-
Campbell touched in ﬁrst in the
500-yard freestyle in 5:32.32.

nior Dana Fredericks and sopho-
more lzzy Brassﬁeld made up
the 200-yard medley relay team
who ﬁnished on top in a time of
1:54.91.

Both teams swam again the
following day in the Centre Col-
lege Invitational. They swam
against DePauw University,
Washington University and Cen-
tre College at the University of
Louisville’s pool complex.

Washington University won
the event for both the men and
women. The Generals’ men’s
team came in right behind them
at second, and the women’s team
ﬁnished third behind second
place DePauw.

Three men won their indi-
vidual events. Ireland came in
again, this time in the 200-yard
breaststroke to record a time of
2:13.02, sophomore Rick Sykes
touched in ﬁrst in the 50-yard
freestyle in a time of 21.39 and
junior Chris Washnock won the
200-yard backstroke in 1:56.75.

Four W&L women came in
with second-place ﬁnishes. Cas-
sada had a strong weekend, as
she added to her earlier win by
coming in right behind the win-
ner in the 100-yard backstroke,
ﬁnishing in a time of 1:02.75.
Rolfe built on her win Friday
by adding a second-place ﬁnish
in the 200-yard freestyle event

als’ swimming teams. The men
will return to pool on Friday,
November 5, when they host
Gardner-Webb at 6:30 pm. The
women swim again on Saturday,
November 6, when they will
compete against Randolph-Ma-
con at 1:00 pm. Both meets will

The Washington and Lee ﬁeld

‘for an ODAC single-game record 496

yards and broke the ODAC record and the
W&L’s school record for rushing yards in
a single season on their way to the ﬁrst
5-0 ODAC conference start in school his-
tory. They are currently at 3,008 rushing
yards for the season with two games left
to play.

The Generals’ entire offensive line
earned ODAC Player of the Week Honors
for their performance. The players on the
line are senior Greg Kurkis, junior John
Fitzgibbons, sophomore Mike Stefanelli
and ﬁrst-years Bobby Jones and Connor
Hollenbeck. .

Sophomore Luke Heinsohn led the way
with 114 rushing yards and a touchdown,
while fellow sophomore Brett Murray ran

for 101 yards and junior Harrison Hudson

added 100 yards and two touchdowns. Se-
nior Jason Zelesnik also ran for his ﬁrst

touchdown of the season.

Junior quarterback Charlie Westfal had
three completed passes with only ﬁve at-
tempts, including a couple of long touch-
down passes. He hit senior tight end Pat-
rick Conley over the middle for a 36 yard
catch and run in the ﬁrst quarter, and later
found Harrison Hudson down the right
sideline for a 30 yard touchdown. Westfal
also added 71 yards on the ground.

The Generals held the Cardinals to only
14 points, the lowest they have held an op-
ponent all season, and forced turnovers at
crucial times. Catholic’s ﬁrst drive ended
on a fumble deep in Generals’ territory,
recovered by sophomore linebacker Doug
Fraser inside the W&L ﬁve yard line.

Sophomore safety Jake Pelton also
intercepted Catholic quarterback Greg
Cordivari at the one yard line in the sec-
ond quarter. Pelton would add a second
interception in the second half and earned
ODAC Defensive Player of the Week
honors for his perfonnance. This week
marked the third week out of the last four
that Peltbn was awarded this honor.

ination as they move to 5-0 in ODA C play

Catholic managed only 100 yards rush-
ing yards, almost exclusively by running-
back Nick Cortese, but the Cardinals did
move the ball effectively through the air.
Cordivari completed 21 of 36 passes for
209 yards, and Lawrence DeSi1none led
the way with six receptions.

Ball control played a huge role in the
lopsided victory. The Generals held pos-
session for 41 minutes and 22 seconds,
compared to only 18 minutes and 38
seconds for Catholic. W&L also scored
touchdowns off of each of Catholic’s four
turnovers for a total of 28 points.

The Generals also set a new ODAC
record for rushing touchdowns on the sea-
son with a current total of 33.

Looking ahead, W&L will host Hamp-
den-Sydney this Saturday at 1:00. Both
teams will enter the game undefeated in
the ODAC, and Washington and Lee will
clinch the outright ODAC championship
and an automatic bid to the NCAA tourna-
ment with a win.

Women win 3, lose I at Emory National Invitational; move to 25-5

By Llzz Dye
STAFF wmrsn

Washington and Lee opened the Emory
National Invitational in Atlanta, Georgia
with a 3-2 win over Berry College, which
would lead them to three more victories
and a tough loss on Friday, October 30.

W&L, with a season record of 23-4 at
the time, came from behind to defeat the
Vikings, 20-9, and post its ninth-straight
victory, 25-23, 21-25, 23-25, 25-20, 15-
11.

The W&L volleyball team won its 10th
match in a row with a 3-1 victory over
Maryville. W&L defeated the Scots, who
were 14-15 on the season, 28-26, 19-25,
25-22, 25-18. It was the second 10-match
winning streak of the season for the Gen-
erals.

First year outside hitter M.A. Boles was
one of three to record at least _l0 kills and
had15 total, while junior middle blocker
Lindsey Dee had 12 and junior outside hit-
ter Megan Daily added 10. Boles also had
11 digs and two service aces.

Sophomore libero Cameron Hill posted
a team-high 13 digs and ﬁrst-year Nikki
DelZenero had 21 assists, 7 digs and two
service aces.

The Generals’ volleyball team was

once again victorious as they recorded
their llth win in a row with 3-2 over
Birmingham-Southem College in at the
Emory National invitational in Atlanta,
Georgia on an exciting afternoon. W&L
(25-4) defeated the Panthers (23-11) 25-
17, 21-25, 25-23, 18-25, 15-8.

Junior Lindsey Dee led the Gener-
als with an impressive career-high nine
blocks and complemented that with eight
kills. First year M.A. Boles proved her
skills with a team-high 13 kills to go
with 15 digs and a pair of blocks. Junior
Megan Daily came out with twelve kills
while sophomore right side Bailey Walker
had ten and senior middle blocker Louise
Brooks recorded nine. '

A great day for the Generals got even
better when ﬁrst-year setter Nikki Del-
Zenero had a team-high 23 assists and 11
digs, while ﬁrst year Meghan Meleski had
21 assists, and sophomore libero Cameron
Hill led the team with 23 digs.

Unfortunately, when the Generals ad-
vanced in the tournament to play No. 2
Emory University, they lost 3-0. W&L
(25-5) fell to the second-ranked Eagles
(27-4), 25-19, 25-17, 25-10.

Daily tallied seven kills while Dee
recorded ﬁve kills and a pair of blocks.
Hill had ten digs and once again led the
defense. Meleski had a team-high 14 as-
sists. At the conclusion of play, both Dee
and Boles were honored and named to the
All-Tournament Team.

Captain Daily said that she is “con-
tinually impressed with how well our ﬁrst
years ﬁt in with the team. They all came in
and have made immediate contributions.”
She also noted that the “seniors have re-
ally fostered a positive team chemistry,
which has manifested in how well we
have done this season. Every day we are
working hard in the gym to get better and
maximize our performance.” She also said
“while we were successful at Emory, we
are building up to the ODAC tournament
to hopefully win and have a great run in
the NCAA tournament.”

The Emory National Invitational con-
cluded W&L’s regular reason play. The
ﬁrst-seeded Generals will next take on

Students fend for themselves
over Thanksgiving break

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

Not all students will be headed home this week-
end for Thanksgiving break.

According to Dean David Leonard, international

students and students from far away states frequent-

ly stay in Lexington during the break.

One such international student is sophomore Si
Young Kim.

Kim, who hails from South Korea, will be spend-
ing his second Thanksgiving break on campus this

. year. He doesn’t get to travel home very often to see

his family and friends in South Korea due to the high
cost of a plane ticket to his native country.

During his Thanksgiving break in Lexington last
year, Kim had to fend for himself for meals. This
was not easy for him, since as a freshman he had
grown accustomed to unlimited sandwiches, fro-yo,
etc. all of the time courtesy of D-Hall.

“I basically got fat,” Kim said, after explain-
ing that his diet during last year’s break consisted
of nothing but instant meals that he bought from
Kroger.

Now a more seasoned veteran when it comes to

“Mainly, I am expecting my break

to be a perfect rest. ”

Sl Young Kim, international student
 

surviving in Lexington during school breaks, Kim
has high hopes for this year.

He already has plans to take a trip to Washington
D.C. on the ﬁrst day of break to visit a Korean gro-
cery store and stock up on food that that has more
nutritional value than a Hungry Man TV dinner. He
plans on supplementing his healthier eating habits
with some exercise as well.

But Kim’s Thanksgiving Break will not just be
about staying ﬁt. He, like many other college stu-
dents on temporary hiatus from their schoolwork,
has a list of several movies that he is planning to
watch. Topping the list currently are Wallstreet,
Wallstreet II and The Social Network.

“Mainly, I am expecting my break to be a perfect
rest,” said Kim.

Kim might have more company this year in Lex-
ington than in the past. If they defeat their opponent
in the opening round of the NCAA Division III tour-
nament, the members of the ODAC-champion foot-
ball team will remain on campus over the break.

Because staying on campus for Thanksgiving
break is often a less than optimal choice for many
students, members of the Washington and Lee com-
munity have traditionally opened their doors to the
students who, for whatever reason, do not go home
for Turkey Day.

For the past two years the Pi Beta Phi House Di-
rector, Carol Garvis, hosted Thanksgiving dinners at
the Pi Phi sorority house. Garvis extended invita-
tions to the women and house directors who were on
campus on Thanksgiving Day, nomatter what soror-
ity they were in.

According to Garvis, about 20 guests came to
each of the dinners. After the feasting was through,
everyone played games like Scrabble or Apples to
Apples.

Garvis said that she would have hosted another
dinner this year were she not spending Thanksgiv-
ing in Copenhagen where her son, Professor Denny
Garvis, is on sabbatical.

Although Garvis cannot host a dinner here in
Lexington this year, her son seems to have inherited
his mother’s desire to share the spirit of Thanksgiv-
ing with others.

“He is inviting some W&L students that are
studying in Copenhagen over for Thanksgiving,”
said Garvis. “I guess the tradition will continue but
at a different location.”

Spring option: the only option?

Spring term boasts new “dream ” courses, but that may not encourage students to register

By Randi Wilson
STAFF WRITER

Last spring term, spring option
was almost the only option for then
sophomore Keke Nichols.

Having spent fall term in Brazil
with the US-Brazil Exchange for
economics and environmental stud-
ies, she knew that despiteher great
experience studying abroad, neither
of those ﬁelds was her calling.

She then changed her major to
romance languages, and knew she
would need to take a class for her
major in the spring in order to stay
on track to graduate in time.

But the Spanish class she signed
up for wasn’t the spring term she was
used to.

“I wanted a more traditional
course,” said Nichols.

What she got was a class that met
five days a week for several hours a
day, and even involved community
service outside of class.

After the first day of classes, she
wanted to transfer out. She sent six
emails to professors to be admitted
to their classes. Three had already
admitted too many students and two
didn’t even reply.

Nichols’s advisor recommended
she simply take spring option. But

luckily the last professor had room ,

in his 200-level sociology class and
Nichols was able to stay on campus.

Her story seemed to be the an-
ecdotal buzz on campus last spring.
Everyone but the freshmen were nos-

talgic for the old spring term (an easy
class or two with lots of free time to
enjoy spring’s festivities).

This year’s spring term courses
were recently added to the registrar’s
page, leaving many students wonder-
ing if this year will be better.

But according to the numbers,
students weren’t nearly as unhappy
as they let on.

According to a satisfaction sur-
vey collected last year at the end of
spring term, 80 percent of students
were admitted to their ﬁrst choice
class. Even though not everyone was
initially satisﬁed, 97 percent said
they ultimately enjoyed their class.

Professor Marc Conner, direc-
tor of the new spring term, said that
Nichols’ case just happened to be the
“perfect storm.”

“That’s going to happen in the
ﬁrst few years of a large init?ative,”
Conner said.

And large initiative is an under-
statement.

Typically it takes 18 months for
a professor to develop anew course.
According to Conner, l 25 new cours-
eswere developed in less than a year
to prepare for the new spring term.

This was made possible through
workshops,
roundtable meetings and one impor-
tant question: “What is your dream
course?”

Although many professors leapt

course development, ’

at the chance, not all professors were
interested in teaching spring term
courses. Subsequently, it appeared
preregistration numbers indicated
that there would be too few courses
offered.

According to University Reg-

istrar Scott Dittman, spring option
numbers ballooned in March. “The
numbers weren’t even close,” said
Dittman.
‘ During preregistration in Decem-
ber, 90 students said they were con-
sidering spring option. By April, 165
had opted to take spring off.

It ended up being a tight fit for the
registrar. There was an 18% cushion,
or available room for students to ﬁll
a course, whereas in a typical semes-
ter there is a 25-30% buffer. Had all
the students not chosen to take spring
option, the cushion would have been
much smaller.

Even though a few courses have
been added to the course listings, it
will still be close as to the number of
courses offered and the students who
want to take them.

Dittman recommends that every-
one who is really interested in spring
option should declare so during win-
ter preregistration, and get a form
from the Ofﬁce of the Registrar,
which is strongly requested before
by March 4. A

While both Conner and Dittman

acknowledge that spring option is

right for some, with reasons varying
for studying for grad school exams
to getting internships or jobs, they
advise students to take classes if they
can.

“Stick around for spring term,”
said Dittman. ’

Spring term is a time to explore
and take classes outside of your ma-
jor, he said.

Conner admitted that even he’s
jealous of the opportunities, as he
looks at the listings and sees “l5
courses I’d like to take.”

Soon-to-be-approved courses in-
clude an interdepartmental course
on the physics of sound and an art
history course on Bollywood, with
more being added daily to the re-
cently posted listing.

This only adds to the plethora of
courses offered last year, from The
Science of Cooking to Digital Media
& Society to Biological Illustration.

These courses aren’t supposed to
be just another class to meet major
requirements, said Conner. lt’s a new
way of thinking and teaching for just
one term a year.

And hopefully, you’ll have a
chance at a course that will “change
your life.”

Seniors at/W&L answer the call

Job-hunting seniors turn to T each for America for teaching opportunities in low-income communities

By Eleanor Kennedy
NEWS EDITOR

College seniors are faced
with myriad options for alter
graduation, ranging from gradu-
ate school to fellowships to brav-
ing the murky waters of the job
market. But for some gifted,
passionate and talented students
there is a third option: Teach for
America.

Ever since its founding in
1990, Teach for America (TFA)
has placed teachers in under-
privileged schools throughout
the U.S. According to the pro-
gram website, TFA has “become
one of the nation’s largest pro-
viders of teachers for low-in-
come schools.”

Although TFA began with

only 500 teachers in six commu-
nities, numbers have risen sharp-
ly over the past 20 years. Accord-
ing to recruiter Matt Taylor, last
year’s 46,000 applications set a
record for the program. Taylor
said he thinks the TFA’s popu-
larity stems from “a growing
interest in public service and the
reputation [they] have developed
for achieving results with under-
served students over the past two
decades.”

Washington and Lee seniors
are no strangers to the opportuni-
ties in TFA. According to Taylor,
7 percent of the class of 2010 ap-
plied. Taylor credits the Shepherd
Poverty program for the high in-

terest from W&L students. ’

Senior Katie Tonneman, who
has already been accepted and
offered a job in south Louisiana,
also thinks that the many pov-
erty-related community service
and educational opportunities at
W&L peak student interest in the
program.

Tonneman said she heard
about TFA while in high school
and always kept it as an option
in the back of her mind. She
made the decision to apply at the
end of this summer. “I thought I
wanted to do something mean-
ingful before law school,” said
Tonneman.

Like Tonneman, senior Sar-

ah Warsco has graduate school
plans but is considering doing
TFA ﬁrst. Warsco wants to get
her doctorate in music, and she
said that teaching experience
before grad school will better
prepare her. “I really want an op-
portunity to teach,” said Warsco,
“and I want to be able to spend
that time somewhere I’d be help-
ing in the best possible way.”
The application process for
TFA is anything but simple. Ap-
plicants are required to submit
an initial application with stan-
dard resume information, plus a
complete list of every class they
have taken in college and the
grades they received. After sub-

mitting the initial application,
some potential teachers have a
phone interview while others,
like Warsco, skip ahead to a full-
day interview.

According to Tonneman, who
had her full-day . interview in
September, applicants who reach
that stage must put together a
lesson plan and teach other in-
terviewees. They must also com-
plete several small group activi-
ties as well as problem-solving
and writing activities.

Taylor said that although the
application process is lengthy, it
helps TFA select the best possible
teachers. “The many components
of our application process allows

us to get to know applicants bet-
ter as we look for the charactef-
istics that we’ve learned through
our 20 years of recruiting and
training teachers are predictors
of success in the classroom,”
said Taylor.

Warsco also sees the applica-
tion process as a way to weed out
people who are not really pas-
sionate about the work that TFA
does. She said she thinks TFA
is looking for people “with the
heart for teaching.”

“Everybody wants a job,”
said Warsco. “But you have to
want to teach, and you have to
want to help people.” ’

“It Gets Better” at Washington 8: Lee

GLBT Equality Initiative hosts event to share youtube videos from the national campaign in response to gay suicides

By Paige Gance
STAFF WRITER

Students and faculty honored
Washington and Lee’s GLBT
community last Thursday by
gathering in the Commons to
watch videos from the “It Get
Better” project. ’

“It Gets Better” started as a
response to the increasing vis-
ibility of gay teen suicides in the
news. In these videos, openly
gay adults urge gay or question-
ing teens to value their own life
as they promise that everything
will get better.

Professor Theresa Braunsch-
neider began It [Gets Better at
W&L with one of her favorite
videos from the project, which
featured a couple named Dan
and Terry.

Braunschneider said she used
the “Little Red Riding Hood”
reference in the video as an ex-
cuse to e-mail it to her English
students, who were studying the
fable. V

“But I really just wanted
some way to spread the word
about this project which I admire
so much,” said Braunschneider.
Braunschneider and Professor
Ellen Mayock received positive
feedback leading up to the event.
The Women’s and Gender Stud-

ies program even donated re-
freshments.

The event itself attracted

around 50 people, who gathered

around to watch the video and
hear student testimonies.

W&L -graduate, contributed to
the event by describing his jour-

ney through W&L as a closeted
and then openly gay student.
“I’m happier about who I am
because I’m not trying to hide
anything anymore,” said Nardi-
ni, who described coming out to
his friend in Leybum Library as
a weight lifting from his shoul-
ders.

At first he anticipated W&L
being another version of high
school and even thought about
transferring. But then, he said,
he found a support group who
accepted him as he was.

“It’s not an easy place to be
out,” said Braunschneider of
the social environment at W&L.
She said that most GLBT stu-
dents end up transferring.

The goal of last Thursday
was to celebrate and affirm
GLBT students at W&L through
the “It Gets Better” project.

It was also a follow up to the,

candlelight vigil in late October
that honored gay teen suicides
through a moment of silence.
This event, however, was
much louder and had a celebra-
tory rather than somber nature.
When the people in the videos
mentioned bullying, the crowd
hissed and booed, but when

they talked about how life got
better, the crowd cheered.
First-year Jeromey Mann also
took a turn showing the audience
his favorite videos. Both clips
were lighthearted and at times
funny, but the ultimate message
was directed at teens struggling
through bullying and abuse.
According to Braunshneider,
although programs like the John-
son Scholarship and Questbridge
have helped W&L increase di-

versity and tolerance, there is

still a lot of work to do. Some
groups are still struggling for ac-
ceptance or are completely unac-
knowledged.

“Lesbians are invisible at this
school,” said Braunschneider.

Two of the videos from the
event featured women talking
about their lives as lesbians. The
ﬁrst was a college ﬁrst-year only
four months out of high school,
who talked about how much
her life has improved in her few
years at college.

GOP could have done more to affect western political races

Despite a hugely successful midterm season, Republicans left a little to be desired in the key area of the Sun Belt

By John Paul Beall
COLUMNIST

They Should Have Said “I’m
Meltingll”

The Midterm Elections have
ﬁnally passed and the data gives
people the ability to reflect upon
the strategies ofthe political par-
ties involved.

While this election was clear-
ly a Republican victory in the
short run, GOP administrators
and party members alike need to
think about posterity.

The GOP, while having a
large following, has made sev-
eral miscalculations in strategy
that can only be linked to the
absence of strong leadership in
the upper echelons of the party
structure.

This election was disastrous
for Democrats, particularly in the
house. States that lean Democrat
found themselves under the at-
tack ofa crimson tidal-wave that
spread across much of the East
Coast and the Midwest.

Many positions assumed to
be secured by the Democrats

went Republican, with a few
pop-up Independents, like Rhode
Island’s Governor.

Many high-proﬁle Democrats
bit the dust, like Senator Fein-
gold of Wisconsin. However,
the GOP seemed to slip up in the
West.

and Nancy Pelosi are all inﬂuen-
tial Representatives from Cali-
fornia who were not unseated,
and against all odds, Harry Reid
of Nevada has survived to tell
the tale.

Barbara Boxer of California
came out on top of a close race

Thurmond-in the Sixties.
Republicans also lost the gu-
bernatorial seat of California (if
you consider Schwarzenegger a
Republican) to an old hat in the
California Democratic Party,
Jerry Brown (a former governor
with a poor record), against one

Because while critical gains could have been made in the West, the

Republican Party was concentrating in the East, boosting for people
like Rand Paul for Kentucky Senator (a race that was pretty safely his

from the moment he announced intention to run). while leaving strong

candidates in highly contested races like those in the West out for the

wolves.

The West is not necessarily
as liberal as many believe, but
regardless the area is a veritable
hotbed for high proﬁle Demo-
crats. Maxine Waters, Joe Baca,

against a likely winner Carly
Fiorina, and the Republicans’
endorsed candidate for Senate in
Alaska lost to the ﬁrst successful
write-in campaign since Strom

of the most dynamic Republican
candidates the nation has seen
since Reagan, Meg Whitman.
As a matter of fact, the west-
ern coast-line north of San Fran-

cisco and many of the districts
along the southem border held
blue.

If all odds spoke for Repub-
licans to win, and the areas in-
volved are not generally liberal
in bias, why did this occur?

Because while critical gains
could have been made in the
West, the Republican Party was
concentrating in the East, boost-
ing for people like Rand Paul for
Kentucky Senator (a race that
was pretty safely his from the
moment he announced intention
to run), while leaving strong can-
didates in highly contested races
like those in the West out for the
wolves.

While Obama was out sweep-
ing the nation and trying to whip
up support, the Republicans have
no one who could do so, a fault
that the leadership of the GOP
can surely claim.

Furthermore, as demographi-
cal changes demonstrate a shift
in emphasis from the Rust Belt to

the Sun Belt, places in the South
and the West will be picking up
importance in the electoral pro-
cess (California has 56 electoral
votes as of 2010).

Republicans used poor strat- I

egy putting up a weak effort in
such important areas while in-
stead rallying areas in the East,
which for the most part are slow-
ly losing inﬂuence.

Those of us who are Republi-
cans can still all applaud the his-
toric turnout ofthis election. Still
we must be skeptical of our party
leadership (what little there is),
because while the gains Demo-
crats made were those made by
the Party, those made by Repub-
licans were largely the result of
public referendum.

Those losses and important
missed opportunities of the GOP
are casualties of Party tunnel-vi-
sion and lack of good strategy.

Congratulations to all candi-
dates and their families.

Pat Smith contemplates life is true meaning after one tragic haircut shattered all his childhood hopes and dreams

I was casually surﬁng our
campus’ ferociously high-speed
Internet one day in the library
(hah), and went to the Yahoo
homepage. The front headline
that appeared was something so
obscene, so offensive, and so not
fair. Brace yourselves...

Emma Watson pulled a Brit-
ney Spears.

It was one of the hardest days

of my life. To see such a great

Witch go to waste nearly broke
my heart.

I have been an avid Harry
Potter fan since day one and this
travesty ranks up there with the
death of Albus Dumbledore, Or-

der of the Merlin — First Class,
Chief Warlock of the Wizenga-
mot, Headmaster — Hogwarts
school of Witchcraft and Wiz-
ardry, Founder — Order of the
Phoenix (R.l.P.).

OK, she didn’t go full-on Brit-
ney Spears, but her hair is shorter
than mine. Imagine missing the
Hogwarts Express and having to
highjack a ﬂyingicar in order to
get to school. Yea, that’s kind of
how I felt. Bad, Bad Dobby.

Emma Watson is about the
same age as me so I don’t feel
bad in saying that I have had a
crush on her since the beginning.

has as a Witch, I would be con-

now, the Whomping Willow has

I always knew I could win
over Hermione one day because
quite frankly, Ron is a "wuss.

Ginny Weasley is kinda hot,.but

Now that my life is in sham-

was so pumped to see the ﬁrst

question myself.

How the Phi got its name...

Taken from the Sept. 25, 1974 issue, this article ﬁnally
provides the answer to a frequently asked question

This is an excerpt from an ar-
ticle which originally appeared
in the Dec. 5, I967, issue of
Ring-tum Phi.

In 1897, the same year that
the New York Post conferred
upon Lexington the title of“Ath-
ens of the South,” the Ring-tum
Phi was born at Washington and
Lee. The name of the ﬂedgling
journal was taken from what
was then considered a scandal-
ous football cheer.

The Phi began as both a
news publication and a compli-
ment to The Collegian, which
started as a fairly serious liter-
ary magazine and ended in 1968
as a humor magazine. The ﬁrst
editor-in-chief George Houston
ran a series of football songs in
the fourth issue which he appar-
ently thought were the type of
thing that the Phi was designed
to print. One of these songs was
that from which the name of the
paper was taken:

“Each other’s back, boys, '
Has got a knack, boys,
For making gains, sir,
Round the end.
And it’s a sin, sir,
For Oberlin (a W&L player),
sir, ,
To buck the V.M.I. boy’s line

So awful hard.
Thejoin the yell, boys,

And yell like h--I, boys,

Sure enough.

To W.&L.U., boys,
'And football, too, boys,
Let’s give a rousing,

Rumbling,

Roaring football yell.
Ring-tum phi, stickeri bum,
We’re hot stuff from Lexing-

ton.

Well, h--I broke loose. (End
excerpt)

The editor of the new pa-
per received an infuriated let-
ter from an anonymous “R” for
publishing such this “sinlet” on
the ﬁrst page of the paper, call-

ing it a “dark, purple crime.”
Times sure have changed.

We have no idea what Ring-
tum Phi means. We have tried
endless translations and creative
thinking, and the best we have
is that “tum” means “then” in
Latin, and “phi” is the symbol,
for the golden proportion.

Since we are lost, we want to
invite you to come up with your
own ideas for what this could
mean and e-mail them to phi@
wlu.edu. While you are at it, go
ahead and come up with some-
thing for “stickeri bum.” That
one is also beyond us.

Rejected article ideas from thisterm

Lacking any solid article ideas, Stockton Bullitt explains some rejects in his quintessential rambling, incolzerant style

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

Sometimes, youjust need to call a spade a spade. I was not in the
mood to write an opinion article this week.

Most weekends, I can pound these babies out effortlessly, but the
anticipation for the Lions-Bills game was simply too much for me
to keep properly focused. So what do you do when you can’t think
of anything to write about? Use a cheap gimmick that makes it look

like you were trying.

Thankfully, this is a great week to use a BS gimmick for an ar-
ticle. The Ring-Tum Phi only has one more issue left in the ﬁrst
semester, and there’s no way that I won’t have plenty of entertaining
material after watching freshmen experience their ﬁrst Christmas

Weekend.

So, to keep you entertained, I present to you the seven articles
that just didn’t quite make the cut for the ﬁrst semester of this year.

All of these articles were either drunkenly discussed on Windfall
or seemed like legitimate articles up until I started to write them.
Unfortunately, either they were a little too controversial, offensive
or just plain stupid to stretch into a full article.

So, while you enjoy your time on the library bathroom toilet, en-
joy these article ideas that still beat anything published in the “Stall

Street Ioumal.”

Kanye West is an
iconic genius, which -
kind of sucks

Ever since I heard his ﬁrst
leak off his new album, I wanted
to write an opus convincing the
world that although Kanye is a
self-righteous douchebag, he is
still the greatest musical genius
ofthe last decade.

Yeah, that may sound like a
hyperbole, but if you take out
the unpopular “808’s & Healt-
break,” every one of Kanye’s al-
bums have been simultaneously
pop hits and far ahead of their
time music wise.

“College Dropout,” released
in 2004, sounded like music in
2006 and “Late Registration,”
released in 2005, sounded like
music in 2008.

And guess what? His new
album, “My Beautiful Dark
Twisted Fantasy” is getting
amazing reviews. Here is what
Rolling Stone wrote in their ﬁve
star review of the album, which
drops on November 22: “lt’s his
best album, but it’s more than
that — it’s also a rock-star mani-
festo for a downsizing world. At
a time when we all get hectored
about lowering our expectations,
surrendering our attention spans,
settling for less, West wants us to
demand more.”

Even more stunning was a
rap mogul’s description of the

album: “Think about the ﬁrst
time you heard Midnight Ma-
rauders or Reasonable Doubt
or 36 Chambers. It’s hard to
take those feelings, sound sub-
ject matter and passion -- all of
those ingredients -- and take it a
step further. It’s stupid.”

So, you get it, people think
his music is good. But the nor-
mal counter to anyone praising
Kanye’s music is his complete
lack of sanity.

However, I have a feeling
Kanye knows a lot more than
you give him credit for. Just look
at how the Taylor Swift moment
at the VMA’s worked out for ev-
eryone involved. Kanye looked
like the bad guy, but still got
enough attention to keep people
interested in him in a year when
he didn’t release an album. Be-
yonce got to play victim while
still getting praised in public.

And Taylor Swift got the best
deal of all. She was able to gain
tons of fan loyalty and public
sympathy for free. Plus, she has
earned permanent empathy on
any situation even when her new
song “Dear John” sounds like it
was written by a bitter middle-
schooler who just discovered
that the boy world doesn’t com-
pletely revolve around her. Plus,
everyone seems to forget this,
but Kanye was freaking right.

Taylor Swift’s video for “You
Belong to Me” was pedestrian
at best, and I’m no diva, but Be-
yonce did have one of the best

videos of all time with “Single
Ladies.”

Still, there’s no way I could
make this into a legitimate arti-
cle. People have and always will
hate Kanye. George Bush won’t
forgive him. Taylor Swift won’t

really forgive him. His fans

won’t forgive him for “Love
Lockdown.” And more impor-
tantly, nobody will forgive him
for being as cocky as he is.

Despite him having a small-
er ego than Bono and Kenny
Powers, he’s the one who gets
viewed in the bad light. I guess
that’s what you get for liking ﬁsh
sticks.

How to write an ,
article in a school
publication

This article would’ve been
one giant hate on both “In-
General” and “MockCon.” The
only disappointing aspect of the
general lack of “I in 4” articles
this year is that I have no real
enemies to make jokes against.
I tried going after the Lexing-
ton Police, but unfortunately,
their police chief was too damn
accommodating and pleasant to
interview. So, after the Parent’s
Weekend editions of “lnGener-
al” and “MockCon” came out, I
thought that it’d be nice to throw
some cheap shots and make
some enemies.

I would’ve ﬁrst tried to ex-
plain to “lnGeneraI” what an
actual blind date is. I’m no ex-
pert, but I don’t think a blind
date is when two friends who
know each other well go out to
dinner without any romantic
expectations. I realize that it’s'
tough to convince anyone at
Washington and Lee to go on
an actual date (Oh, that’s just
me...um...nevermind), but
when you purport a section
of your magazine to be about
blind dates, at least try and
make it a charade.

With the “M ockCon” publi-
cation, I would’ve taken some
even cheaper shots, noting that
Career Services already does a
fantasticjob telling people how
to interview. Also, the whole
“we would tell you more sto-
ries, but” line is a waste of the
energy it took me to read that
sentence. That’s like going to
all of your friends and telling
them, “I have the greatest story
from last night, but I can’t re-
ally talk about it.” Itjust makes
people hate you.

I ended up not writing this
article for three main reasons.
First and foremost, I think you
can already tell that I was doing
some serious nitpicking there.
Overall, both publications were
fantastic, and any real criticism
I made just sounded a lot like
me calling the kettle black.
Second, I just wrote an article
hating on Republicans. Did
you really want another article
ﬁlled with “Haterade?” I didn’t
think so. Third, the editors of
both publications hold way too
much power at this school, and
I can’t waste any opportunities
to brown-nose. By the way,
“lnGeneral” is that a new top?
It looks radiant.

Hawto play -
preventdefense on
yoursisterduring
Parent’s Weekend

C’mon, tell me you’re not
reading this article. As every

older sibling knows full well,
there is nothing scarier than
bringing your younger sibling
out on a Friday or Saturday
night. Not only is there the worry
that he or she will see you for the
morally decrepit person you’ve
become, but he or she also has a
direct line to the parents, which
can always be dangerous.

Worse is when the younger
sibling gets out of your sights.
Usually, he or she ends up overly
drunk in a very precarious situ-
ation. And you’d never believe
this, but there is no shortage of
students at Washington and Lee
who wouldn’t mind hooking up

with a high school student. Who
would debase themselves so
much as to do that?

What this means is that the

entire night is spent either try-
ing to look as religiously pure
as possible or playing some
serious prevent defense on the
sibling. Some quality defensive
procedures include accidentally
inserting embarrassing child-
hood stories into conversation,
getting a cadet to bodyguard for
the night and keeping a “Call of
Duty: Black Ops” level recon on
the sibling at all times.

Overall, I would’ve loved to
write this article and was com-
pletely ready to implement all
my various strategies when my
eighteen year old sister visited
campus during Parent’s Week-
end. Sadly, nothing came to fru-
ition for one main reason. My
sister has something in common
with Veronica Mantooth and
Reggie Bush. She is a SAINT,
and would not do anything re-
motely incriminating ever. Yeah,
I’ll stick with that story.

Kevin Gamett and .
“cancer”:
not a big deal

There was a ruckus made
in the NBA over the past week
over an alleged comment Bos-
ton Celtic Kevin Garnett made
to another NBA player, Charlie
Villanueva. Garnett, a known
trash talker, allegedly called Vil-
lanueva a “cancer patient” dur-
ing a game. Villanueva, who
suffers from a skin disease that
prohibits him from growing hair
anywhere on his body, broke this
story over his Twitter account.

This story was beat to death
on ESPN and other sports news
outlets, and it quickly took the
Brett Favre’s Body Part Memo-
rial Award for dumbest news
story of the moment.

For one, Kevin Garnett tried
to back out of his comment by
saying that he called Charlie Vil-
lanueva “a cancer to his team
and the league.” C’mon KG,just
man up and admit what you said.
Watch any Celtics game, and ev-
ery cut to Garnett on the bench
features him dropping a different
version ofthe F-Bomb. Like he’s
going to resist the softball trash
talk line on Charlie Villanueva.

Much worse things are said
even in IM ﬁag football games
on campus here. Plus, I know
it’s brutally offensive and in bad
taste, but take the time to look
at Charlie Villanueva and try
not to laugh. He’s about as good
looking as Kenny Powers’ half
brother.

comAprehensIvegiant’ '
preview ofthe NBA

In early October, a friend of

mine sent me the 380 page Bas-
ketball Prospectus for this up-
coming NBA season. As my test
grades show, I spent most of the
month digesting all the informa-
tion I could. Say what you want
about the NBA, but this is the
best regular season product the
league has put out in years. 24
of the 30 NBA franchises have a
legitimately exciting element to
their game and far fewer teams
are employing the coasting
method that has alienated sports
fans for years.

To highlight how great this
season would be, I planned to
make some bold predictions
about the NBA. This would’ve
been a sweet idea until I remem-
bered that I am terrible at mak-
ing predictions. I was certain
that the Ivory Coast would be
this year’s dream team in the
World Cup. I convinced all of
my friends that “Avatar” would
be taken seriously. Most of all, I
knew that laMarcus Russell was
a lock for rookie ofthe year.

So, even though I did call the
success ofthe Golden State War-
riors and the New York Knicks,
I decided that I’d let the sports
section cover sports and stick to
the opinions section.

Hawto survive being
the token dumb
kid in class

Considering we all go to
Washington and Lee, I’m guess-
ing that most of us are pretty
smart students. However, now
that we’re in a pretty tough col-
lege, there will always be the
classes that seem like they are
taught in a different language.
Well, yeah some of them actu-
ally are, but you get my point.

Most of us didn’t spend our
high school careers being the
kid who simply could not grasp
the material no matter what was
said. So, I thought now that I’m
a junior and I’m getting very
good at being the token dumb
kid, I’d give some valuable ad-
vice to those new to the feeling.
See, instead of getting down on
yourself and checking out of the
class, strategy is most important
in the class you’re hoping to get
a C in.

There are some valuable strat-
egies to abide by when donning
the dunce cap in class. First, nev-
er sit in the front or in the back of
class. Sitting in front makes the
professor all too aware of your
blank stare while she is lectur-
ing, and sitting in back makes
you the target of the “I’m going

to call on a random member of -

the class to make sure he or she
is paying attention” method that
pretty much every liberal arts
teacher uses every lecture.
Second, get very good at hav-
ing your facial expressions mir-
ror the professor’s. So when the
professor is smiling and giddy,
you should look happy and gid-
dy yourself. When the profes-
sor is serious and focused while
lecturing, you need to seem just
as focused and serious about
the material. Couple this with
continuous eye contact with the
professor, and you’re guaranteed

at least ﬁve token pity points, '

which is really what you’re aim-
ing for in the dumb kid strategy.

Lastly and most importantly,
always talk to the professor.
You should not do this so you
can learn the material better,
but rather so you can improve
your grade by manipulating
every professor’s dream of mi-
raculously turning the dumb kid

in the class into a hard work-
ing genius. Say you didn’t do
the reading, then you deﬁnitely
should visit the professor to talk
about the material. Just shoot
out some line like “I worked for
hours on this material, but I feel
like I don’t understand a word,”
and boom, the teacher will buy it
hook line and sinker.

This really couldn’t be a le-
gitimate article because then the
secret of grade manipulation
would be over. Good thing my
professors didn’t make it this far
because otherwise, I’d actually
have to do the reading.

Over the last month, every
college from Eastern Washing-
ton to Harvard has come out
against Four Loko. If you’re
reading this in a bathroom stall,
you also might notice the ﬂyer
to the right of you calling for the
banishment of Four Loko.

Look, I get spreading aware-
ness for the potential dangers of
mixing alcohol and caffeine, but
calling for it to be made illegal is
more pointless than hiring a ma-
riachi band to accompany farm
animals.

Having had a Four Loko or
two in my life (and even writing
an article about it last year) has
given me some insight into the
drink. For one, everyone who
drinks a Four Loko has a pretty
good idea of what one are put-
ting into his or her body. It’s not
like people are drinking these
things for pleasure and acciden-
tally getting drunk.

Second, if you are going to
condemn college drinking just
for the sake of getting drunk,
don’t act like Four Loko is the
only enabler here. If you want to
go after Four Loko, then go after
shots, games like beer pong and
funnels. It’s not like Four Loko is
breaking any new ground here.

Lastly, all the attention these
health groups are giving Four
Lokos are working against them.
Like Pokemon, Miley Cyrus and
Razor Scooters, Four Lokos are
a fad. Once you drink enough of
them, they tend to get old after
a while. Instead of letting the
fad run its course, these health
groups are givingmore attention
and coverage to the drink.

Letting people know that they
will feel less drunk while still
having the same damaging ef-
fects is not exactly stopping any
college student from drinking a
Four Loko. If you really want to
get people to cut down on their
drinking of Four Loko, just ﬁlm
students who are eight to twelve
loko deep, and show them the
next day how intelligent they
sound. End of story.

International House hosts eye-opening film screening

Film exposes the cruel and devastating lives of sugar cane cutters in the Dominican Republic

By Nay Lin
STAFF wrmen

International House hosted a
screening of the ﬁlm “The Price
of Sugar” and followed it with
a discussion panel. The screen-
ing attracted over 50 students,
faculty and staff from a variety
of disciplines, ranging, from En-
vironmental Studies and Ceram-
ics (Reeves Center) to Romance
Languages and Economics.

The idea for the movie screen-
ing was motivated by a similar
screening event hosted by United
Nations Associations for United
States ofAmerica (UNAUSA) in
New York City.

The movie shows the be-
hind-the-scenes view of sugar
from the perspective of Father
Christopher Hartley. The priest
traveled to the Dominican Re-

public to improve the Haitian
sugar cane cutters’ living situa-
tion. Haitians’ desperate needs
for jobs led them across borders
to Dominican Republic’s sugar
plantation ﬁelds where they were
paid minimally in vouchers to
exchange food and kept under
armed guard called bateyes.

Cane cutters suffered from
malnutrition and had to rely on
sugar cane as the only nutrition
source. Jhonny Belizaire says, “I
am not afraid because I believe
there is no death worse than
this.”

At one point in the movie,
Father Hartley says, ‘‘I’m sure
most American families would
be embarrassed to know at what
price they putsugar in their cof-

fee every morning."

The discussion following the
movie focused on how the Unit-
ed State’s sugar protectionism
factorslinto this situation and the
idea that the free trade of sugar
could be a possible solution. The
impact of sugar on the consump-
tion of tea, coffee and cocoa in
the United States, as well as the
alternatives for sugar such as
maple syrup, corn, honey and ap-
ple, were also explored. Panelists
included Mike Smitka, Professor
of Economics, Susan Dixon,
Professor ofFrench, Leah Green,
Professor of Environmental
Studies and English, Ron Fuchs,
Reeves Center Curator, Laura
Henry-Stone, Post-Doctoral Fel-
low of Environmental Studies

and senior Cailin Slattery, the
100 Projects for Peace winner,
who spent her summer working
with a microﬁnance organization
in the Dominican Republic.)

In the spirit of the occassion,
Amy Richwine prepared Haitian
snacks - Coconut bread, Pain Pa-
tat (Sweet Potato Bread), Banane
Pese (Fried Plantain) and Pine-
apple Nog that were served be-
fore the screening.

The mission of the Interna-
tional House is to promote inter-
national learning by facilitating
interaction and communication
between students and members
of the W&L community.

Arts League will host Holiday Art Sale

W&L Arts League is accepting donated pieces of art from the community to sell at an art sale before Christmas break

By Holly Suthers
STAFF WRITER

The Arts League of Wash-
ington and Lee is sponsoring a
holiday art sale for the ﬁrst time.
The sale will be held on Wednes-
day, December 1 from 4' p.m. to
7 p.m. in Wilson Hall.

The league is currently col-
lecting art from students and fac-
ulty, and will continue to do so
until the end of the week. Com-

munity members are encouraged
to attend.

The pieces will be sold for
less than $100 each and the prof-
its will go towards a trip to New
York City.

“We thought that selling art
would be an appropriate way to
raise money for a trip to visit art
galleries and museums in New

York City," said freshman lva
Weidenkeller.

Half of the selling price for
each piece will be given to the
artist and the other towards the
Arts League. The group is hop-
ing to travel to New York over
the first weekend of Washington
Holiday in February.

“We’re hoping that this sale

can raise a lot of money for the
trip and for Arts League, provide
a lot of people with Christmas
presents, and give some students
and local artists some good ex-
posure.”

Refreshments and music will
be provided at the event, as well
as holiday cheer while Christmas
shopping. Students may submit

their aitwork by ﬁlling out forms,
which are posted around Wilson
Hall, by the end ofthis week.
The Arts League will host
similar events in the future and
encourages all interested stu-
dents tojoin. ‘
“[Arts League] is not just
for visual artists, but musicians,
dance performers, art historians,

and basically anyone who wants
to see and interact with more art
on campus.”

For more information about
participating in the Holiday Arts
Sale or to take part in other ac-
tivities, e-mail artsleague540@

The swimming team racked up its third straight victory as they took down Sweet Briar last Friday an

By Jayna Johns
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee women’s'
swimming team is on a roll as it cap-
tured two victories in two meets the past
couple of weekends. in one of those

‘ meets, a relay team broke a pool record
that had stood since 1984.

Last Saturday, November 6, the
women took down Randolph-Macon in
Lexington with a score of 153-102 in
their ﬁrst conference meet.

Friday, the women travelled to Sweet
Briar and came away with a 145-106
win. The Generals now post a 3-1 sea-
son record and have not lost since the
season opener.

Against Randolph-Macon, six swim-
mers took home individual ﬁrst-place
ﬁnishes in eight events. The Yellow

Jackets managed to win both relay
events, although one of those the Gen-
erals missed by less than a quarter of a
second.

Sophomore Delaney Rolfe touched
in ﬁrst in two events. She swam the 200
yard free style in 1:59.84 and the 500
yard free style in 5:23.24. Junior Katie
Salvati also won two events, coming
in ﬁrst in the 100-yard backstroke in
1:03.32 and in the 200 yard backstroke
in a time of 2:14.06.

Sophomore Ann McCampbell won
the 1000 yard freestyle in 11:06.95, and
fellow sophomore Brittany Ross took
the 200 yard butterﬂy in 2:15.49. Junior
Dana Fredericks swam the 200 yard
breaststroke in a time of 2:35.31_and

ﬁrst-year Lauren Kasoff won the 100
yard butterﬂy in 1:02.50.

The Generals had the top three ﬁn-
ishers in the 1000 yard freestyle, the 100
yard backstroke and the 200 yard but-
terﬂy.

The following Friday, an exhibition
team consisting of_Fredericks, sopho-
more Izzy Brassﬁeld and ﬁrst-years
Rebecca Lawrence and Meredith Hardy
broke a 26 year old record after ﬁnishing
the 200 yard freestyle relay in a time of
1:53.06.

The women’s day followed that
success as they collected eight indi-
vidual victories and one relay win, de-
spite swimming competitively in only
11 events. They swam the other three

events as exhibitions, so their ﬁnishes
in those races did not count towards the
ﬁnal score.

Fredericks won two of her events,
coming in ﬁrst in the 100 yard back-
stroke in 1:10.86 and the 100 yard free-
style in 1:02.25. . ‘

Senior Tess Hayden won the 400
yard freestyle in a time of4:46.46. Rolfe
came in ﬁrst in 2:32.68 to take the 200
yard butterﬂy, and McCampbell took the
200 yard backstroke in 2233.67.

The team’s younger swimmers had
a successful day as well, as three ﬁrst-
year swimmers had top ﬁnishes. Kasoff
touched in in a time of 2:16.79 to win
the 200 yard freestyle, Alexandra Vi-
ers ﬁnished in 1:25.57 in the 100 yard

set a pool

breaststroke and Michelle Szymczak'~

came in in 3:02.02 to take the 20() yard

The relay team consisting of Hayden,
sophomore Stephanie Krasnov, junior
Erin Schwartz and senior Becky Guynn
brought home the ﬁnal ﬁrst-place ﬁnish
for W&L, winning the 200 yard medley
relay in 2:13.02.

The women will return to the pool
on Nov. 20 as they travel to Franklin &

Season ends for W&L Volleyball

The Generals fell to Number 1 seed Emory University, 3-1, in the second round of the NCAA Division III tournament

By Lizz Dye
STAFF WRITER

The Generals volleyball team had a
satisfying day when it was granted an at-
large bid to the 2010 NCAA Division 111
Women’s Volleyball Championship last
Monday, despite losing to Randolph-
Macon in the ODAC tournament. Seed-
ed No. 4, Washington and Lee (27-6)
was picked to play No. 5 Mt. St. Joseph
(21-10) in the ﬁrst round of the touma-
ment.

“We [are] really excited to... go to

Atlanta, but we totally feel that we have
earned this and want to compete,” team
captain Megan Daily said before her
team left.

W&L was ultimately victorious
over Mt. St. Joseph, defeating them
decisively 3-1 in the ﬁrst round of the
tournament. The Generals were led
by ﬁrst-year outside hitter and recent
American Volleyball Coaches Associa-
tion South Region Freshman of the Year

\

M.A. Boles, who totaled 14 kills and 14
digs, while Daily, a junior outside hit-
ter, and Louise Brooks, a senior middle
blocker, each added 10 kills. Junior
blocker Lindsey Dee‘ contributed seven
kills and six blocks, while Brooks had
four blocks and Boles three. F irst-year
setter Nikki DelZenero led the Generals
with 32 assists and also chipped in eight
digs. Sophomore libero Cameron Hill
had a team-high of23~digs for that game

and senior defensive specialist added 17
more.

The Generals ended up falling to No.
1 seed Emory University 3-1 in the sec-
ond round of the tournament on Satur-
day evening. Hill notched a match-high
of 24 digs and senior defensive special-
ist Jenna Finger added nine more digs,
as well as a pair of service aces.

Boles led the Generals with 15 kills
while chipping in 10 digs, and Dee add-

ed 1 0 kills and four blocks. Setter Del-
Zenxero recorded 19 assists and 12 digs
and ﬁrst-year setter Meghan Meleski
contributed 13 assists.

This loss ended a very successful
Generals season as they ﬁnished with a
28-7.

Football ODAC Champs! 

A historical season for the Generals continues on as NCAA playoﬁfs loom

By Jayna Johns

SPORTS EDl_TOR

They were expected to ﬁnish ﬁfth in a
conference of only seven teams. It made
sense, really. They were young, they were
inexperienced and they were coming off
back-to-back losing seasons. Even their
head coach understood that this did not
look like it was going to be their year.

“I didn’t expect this to happen this year.
Maybe next year, but not this one,” Head
Coach Frank Miriello said.

Looks like someone forgot to tell the
team that.

The Washington and Lee football team
shattered expectations while breaking re-
cords in a historical season capped by a
45-3 dismantling of Juniata College last
Saturday.

But that wasjust icing on the cake. The
real prize was winning the ODAC title
while posting a perfect conference record
for the first time in school history.

Before a packed Parent’s Weekend
crowd on Nov. 6, the Generals sailed
by previously-unbeaten conference foe
Hampden-Sydney 38-27 to claim the title.
The score only looks that close because
of a Tiger touchdown with seven seconds
left on the clock that meant nothing to the
game’s ﬁnal outcome. W&L took a 31-I4
lead early in the fourth quarter and never
looked back.

Saturday’s crowd packed the stands,
while many more fans were left to ﬁnd a
place to stand. And the crowd’s presence
was felt by the team.

“The atmosphere...was just electric,”
said sophomore running back Brett Mur-
ray, who rushed for 95 yards and two
touchdowns in the game.

Coach Miriello seemed to agree, say-
ing the team historically responds well to
large crowds. “I wish we could have ﬁve
parent’s weekends,” he said.

Even more surprising than the number
of people was that the W&L crowd, infa-
mous for leaving games at half-time, stuck
with the team through the very end, a de-
tail that the team noticed gratefully.

“And the crowd stayed!” Miriello ex-
claimed, adding emphatically, “Thank
God they stayed.” -

The Generals added to their already im-
pressive resume with a routing of Juniata.
Any worry that the team would lose focus
was put to rest early as sophomore running
back Luke Heinsohn pulled off a 63 yard
run in W&L’s ﬁrst offensive play of the
game. Junior running back Harrison Hud-
son found the end zone two plays later.

W&L was leading 21-0 before Juniata
managed to get on board in the ﬁnal min-
utes of the ﬁrst half. The General’s de-
fense absolutely dominated, allowing only
a 29-yard ﬁeld goal for the entire game.
This marks the ﬁrst time this season the
General’s kept their opponent out of the
end zone. ,

The win over Juniata marks the ﬁrst
time since 1981 that W&L football has
had eight wins in regular season play, and

the ﬁrst time since 1961 that the program
has won seven games in a row. That year,
W&L went undefeated and was named
the best small college team in the nation,
according to generalssportscom. There
were no conferences in Division lll foot-
ball that year.

The past two games show just how
much the team has improved. This season
did not begin promisingly, as the Generals
opened by getting “waxed” by Franklin
& Marshall, said Miriello. They followed
with a promising win over Sewanee, giv-
ing the team “a ray of hope,” only to “give
one away” against Averett, a game in
which they were leading 10-0 going into
the fourth quarter and fell apart, giving up
20 unanswered points.

At this point, the team looked like they
were going to live up to earlier expecta-
tions. But something changed within the
team.

I»-'1-~uv....~. ta...“
. r--it-we-nzaq...-. «._.,,

being close. Perhaps most astounding is
their ability to end an opponent’s drive
with a turnover. Throughout the season,
the defense has accumulated an astound-
ing 22 interceptions, led by sophomore
ball-hawk Jake Pelton, who has had six.
in comparison, W&L has been intercepted
only three times.

Since the team’s turnaround, they have
won each game by an average of just over
2l'points.

This season was especially nice after
“the frustration of the last two years,”
Westfal said. He has been the starting
quarterback since his freshman year.

Next up for the team is the NCAA

‘Championship playoffs. The team is ex-

cited, but Westfal also said the idea of
competing was a “weird feeling.” The
team has always felt like they were on the
outside looking in when it came to football
on the national stage.

Junior linebacker Rob Look takes down a Tiger ball carrier during the
Parent’s Weekend match. Look recorded seven solo tackles and two
pass break-ups in the game, which lead the team is both areas.

Junior quarterback Charlie Westfal said

players began stepping up and taking more '

active roles within the team, These players
helped foster a positive team chemistry, an
internal conﬁdence that grewevery day.

Miriello said everything just began to
click. The team was no longer “young and
inexperienced,” and players were “buying
into” the system of focusing on fundamen-
tals and discipline.

“To achieve success, you have to be
disciplined and focused, and that requires
maturity,” Miriello said. The team was
getting better and playing better every
week as a result.

And they have not tasted defeat since.

The defense took slightly longer to
mature than the offense, but they still
managed to keep all but one game from

“lt’s hard to get a gauge of where [the
team] stands compared to other teams na-
tionally,” Westfal said. “All the team can

’ do is play the way we’ve been playing.”

Miriello hopes that Saturday’s win will
give the team momentum heading into the
Championship games. .

And players are optimistic for the fu-
ture of the program.

“This season is by no means a ﬂuke,
and we plan to continue building upon our
success this year,” said Murray. The team
wants to “really give the fans something to
get excited about [for the] future.”

The team’s Cinderella story will con-
tinue next Saturday as they face Thomas
More in Kentucky at 12 p.m.

VOLUME CXIV, NUMBER 9

Graduation:
Why wait?

Seven seniors enter ‘the real

world earlier than the rest

By Paige Gance
STAFF WRITER

Seven seniors will graduate early this December,
which is more than the last ﬁve years combined.

Last year, only three seniors graduated early. In-
cluding this year, 26 students have done so in the
past decade. ,

The reasons for graduating early‘vary from stu-
dent to student, but current credit policies have made
it easier to do so.

When the class of 2011 entered Washington and
Lee, they needed 121 credits to graduate. Now the
requirement is only 113 for all graduating classes,
regardless of the requirement when they started at
W&L.

University Registrar Scott Dittman said that when
the credit requirement was higher, students were usu-
ally awarded more credits for AP scores and other
outside credits. Now, he said, “standards are tighter
for credit transfer.” - ‘

This means that the class of 2011 could, for ex-
ample, have received six credits for an AP U.S. His-
tory score that is now only worth three.

Neither of the two seniors who commented on
their early graduation ever had to overload or take
summer courses in order to accumulate the required
number of credits.

Senior Jack Ivy ﬁnished his computer science
major last spring term and only needs to pass this
semester’s courses in order to reach 113 credits. Ivy
entered his freshmen year with math credit that al-
ready counted toward his major.

“I knew what I wanted to do coming in,” Ivy said,
which helped him focus on the required classes for
his major.

Senior Beth Valentine already has enough credits
to graduate and only needs to pass yoga in order to
have the required four PE classes. She has already
completed her philosophy major and will complete a
politics major this semester.

All seniors who plan to graduate early must ap-
ply for their degree in the spring of their junior year.
Even though Valentine missed the deadline, she said
the philosophy department was supportive and a fac-
ulty/student board approved her early graduation.

As for post-graduation plans, both Ivy and Valen-
tine are engaged to W&L students who have already
graduated. While the rest of the student body takes
ﬁnals, Valentine will be getting married. Ivy has set
his date for the weekendbefore the Class of 2011
Commencement. All seniors who graduate early
will still be able to walk with their class at com-
mencement, even though their degree will have been
mailed to them in January.

Ivy said he hopes to “get ajump on the job mar-
ket,” while saving $19,750 that would have gone to
next semester’s tuition.

Dittman said that thecost of a technically un-
necessary semester is “deﬁnitely a consideration for
some people,” especially given the current economic
climate.

Valentine said she looks forward to “taking a
break” from course work as she spends time in la-
pan, where her future husband teaches.’ Her ultimate
plan is to start graduate school next fall and eventu-
ally work her way to a Ph.D in philosophy.

Even though these seniors are leaving W&L a
little earlier than the rest of us, they still hold fond
memories of their time here.

“The professors have been amazing,” said Valen-
tine, who also said she would miss the close friends
she has made and “even the quaint town of Lexing-
ton.” .

As he talked about people and classes that shaped
his college experience, Ivy said, “lt’s been an incred-
ible three and a half years.”

Sessions says good bye I

After forty years at Washington and Lee, Professor Laa’ Sessions prepares to retire

By Eleanor Kennedy
NEWS EDITOR

Philosophy professor Lad Ses-
sions has worn many hats during his
time at Washington and Lee. Now,
after 40 years, he’s decided to hang
up all of them. .

Sessions is teaching his last
philosophy course this tenn before
ofﬁcially retiring at the end of the
school year. '

Although many will be sad to
see him go, Sessions said he has a
simple reason for retiring this year.

“I’m older than dirt,” he said.

Sessions began teaching at W&L
40 years ago, but his interest in phi-
losophy began long before that.

Growing up in a tiny town
in South Dakota, Sessions ﬁrst
thought he wanted to be a joumal-
ist. That major lasted less than a
year, however, and he soon began
pursuing other subjects. He even-
tually settled on an English major,
but discovered philosophy in his
last two years of school.

After college, Sessions spent
two years at Columbia Univer-
sity’ Union Theological Seminary.
Although he knew that religious
orders weren’t for him, Sessions’s
interest in religion and philosophy
grew during those years. .

Sessions went on to get his
doctorate from Yale University be-
fore taking his ﬁrst teaching job at
W&L. He’s been here ever since.

Professor Emeritus Harry Pem-
berton remembers when Sessions
began his teaching career. Pem-
berton was going on sabbatical and

associate dean.

the best candidate,” said Pemberton.
“Fortunately, he accepted our offer
to come to W&L. I left conﬁdent the
department would thrive, and indeed
it did.”

When Pemberton returned, the
department expanded in order to
keep Sessions as part of the staff

But Sessions has done more than
just teach. He calls himself a “re-
covering administrator” because he
served two different terms as Acting

Although Sessions remembers
his years as an administrator far less
fondly than his time as a teacher, his
colleague and friend Professor Ed
Craun had high praise for Sessions’s
willingness to “step into the breach”
and take on the job. “He was a tire-
less advocate for‘the_ needs of the
college’s students, faculty members
and programs,” said Craun.

Despite his many varied experi- ‘

his favorite part of being a part of
the W&L community? “lt’s the stu-
dents," Sessions said.

Thousands of students have
passed through Sessions’s classes
over the years. Several havekept
in touch with him, including some
graduates from the late 70s and early
80s.

These relationships with students
are one of the things Sessions val-

ues most about his time as a profes-
sor. “I just hope l’ve touched a few
students,” said Sessions. He added,
however, that he doesn’t care if those
students remember he was the one
who influenced them.

“I’m more interested in the effect
than in the remembrance that it was .
me,” Sessions said.

His friend and colleague Harlan
Beckleysaid the odds are good that
Sessions will be remembered for
quite some time.

“He will be missed,” Beckley
said, though he’s sure Sessions will
stay an active member of both the
local community and the W&L com-
munity after retiring.

“Students will still see Lad Ses-
sions,” Beckley said. .

Sessions said that he is going to
spend his newfound free-time doing
projects around his house, pursuing
his interest in photography, travel-
ling, volunteering and, in a last act of
service for the students and profes-
sors at_W&L, converting his ofﬁce
into a departmental library.

The bookshelf-lined ofﬁce is al-
ready ﬁlled with endless tomes on
philosophy, but there’s likely to be at
least one addition. Sessions’s newest
book, Honor for Us: A Philosophical

‘Analysis. Interpretation and Defense

will be available in the University
Store on Dec. l(_). _

Sessions’s interest in honor,
which inspired the book, is closely
tied with his experience teaching at a
school with a strong honor system.

About ll years ago, he began
teaching a course on the concept of
honor and was surprised to ﬁnd that
many students have different inter-
pretations of the concept. He said
that people at W&L rarely think
about honor in a detailed, academic
way, and he thought book would be a
helpful way to organize his thoughts
on the subject.

The philosophy department will
be saying its goodbyes to Sessions at
a retirement party on Monday, Dec.
13 at 6 p.m. at Morris_House.

' then take over the planning pro-

cess, from beginning future re-
cruitment to creating the year’s‘
schedule.

This addition is two years in
the making, spurred on by a gen-
erous donation made by alumnus
Matthew Goodwin ’_94.

' Hathom said that Goodwin,
a former soccer player, wanted
to do something signiﬁcant for
the athletics department to give
back for his time spent here.

Goodwin donated $800,000
to be spent over a period of 10
years. During this time, the uni-
versity will gradually take over
ﬁmding. By 2020, the school
will fully fund the team.

Adding women’s golf will
mean equalize the number of
men and women’s sports: twelve
each, which may leave some
wondering if it was added just
to comply with Title IX. Though
it was a contributing factor, Ha-
thom said that this decision was
motivated by more than equal
opportunity. ,

“We need to move forward,
but I always ﬁgured that golf
would be a natural add,” said
Hathom.

The decision to look at golf
seriously as a future sport began
two years ago, when W&L did

a study to examine compliance
with Title IX and which sports
should be added. It was an easy
choice because golf seemed like
a “natural ﬁt” here at W&L, Ha-
thom said.

Another motivation for a
women’s golf team was the pres-
ence of a strong women’s club
team here on ‘campus. It’s all
part of a “wise system in place,”
which makes sure that a sport
will succeed, she said.

Hathom stressed that build-
ing off of a successful club team
prevents sports from being added
because they’re “trendy” or just
satisfying a compliance issue.
Adding a sport is an expensive
enterprise and requires extensive
planning. There ﬁrst needs to be
an obvious interest in a sport,
best shown by a club team that
appears year after year.

That being said, when a sport
has been approved for varsity
status, the university does ev-
erything it can to make sure it’s
done right. They’re given all the
resources they need to succeed,
never with a half-hearted ‘be-
cause we’re supposed to’ rea-
son.

‘‘I have not experienced in
my time here any less than that,”
said Hathom.

As a result, sports succeed
here because they’re given ev-
erything they need to do well.

Even though the addition of
women’s golf has been a long
time in the making, it comes in a
big year for women on campus.
This year is the 25th anniversary
of coeducation at W&L.

In order to mark the occasion,
several alums have been invited
to come speak at events in a se-

ries entitled “Leadership Gender
and Community at Washington
& Lee,” which is headed up by
Associate Dean Allison Bell,
‘9l. ‘

A few of these alums were
student-athletes during their
time here, and spoke about the
importance of athletics in their
development as leaders, said
Bell. Their experience on the
court created a sense of confi-
dence and self-reliance that has
enabled them to succeed in their
careers in the male-dominated
ﬁeld of science.

Bell, a member of one of the
ﬁrst coed classes at W&L, said
she has noticed changes occur-
ring over the years. Women here
have relaxed into their place on
campus, and have less ofa need
to. prove themselves academi-
cally. —
“There is a comfort with co-
education, perhaps [conﬁdence
among] the women with them-
selves,” said Bell.

According to Bell, women
have been able to take their abil-
ity to succeed in the classroom
and on the ﬁeld in a matter of
course.

Regardless ofability, Hathom
encourages both men and wom-
en who are interested in playing
golf to try out for. the team next
fall. The future coach will be in
charge of the ﬁnal roster, but
next year the team will be look-
ing for all levels oftalent.

Aunified Korea will not come withouta full-scale war

In light of North Korea is recent aggression against South Korea, conﬂict seems imminent

By John Paul Beall
COLUMNIST

For the past twenty years, the
world has been kidding itself
about a peaceful re-union be-
tween the two Koreas. Perhaps,
for a while, it had looked like it
would happen.

They marched into Olympic
arenas together. The focus of
North Korea’s Cult of Personal-
ity died. And as their ﬂags show,
they are both Korea: two halves
of the same whole.

But November 23, the North
Koreans began shelling a South
Korean island near the oceanic
border.

In the end, we can be conﬁ-
dent that the two Koreas will

unite, though it will be far from ,

peaceful.

The issue is that now North
Korea disputes the long-estab-
lished oceanic border, and that
demonstrates the essence of the
problem.

On both sides ofthe Demilita-
rized Zone, the people and gov-
ernments feel that union should
occur. Each side believes that it
has the legitimate government
and the legitimate ideology... and
that the other side is wrong.

But what is the origin of the
bloody armistice line that scars
this war-laden region?

After World War II, Japan lost
its empire, which for thirty-ﬁve
years had contained the Korean
Peninsula.

At the Conference of Cairo in
1943, the Big Three and Chiang
Kai-Shek agreed that the Allies
should occupy Korea to assist
in nation-building, a notion that

many Koreans did not like at the

time.

Korea was treated like occu-
pied Germany: jointly occupied
and sliced into man-made re-
gions to create a new country. In

fact, it was exactly the same idea
the the Allied forces decided to
use in the wake of World War I

_ when they dissolved the empires

around their opponents.

This “mandate”-style occu-
pation had justiﬁed English and
French interference in the Mid-
dle East, a large reason for the
troubles there today.

Both the United States and the
USSR split the area right down
the middle on the 38th parallel,
while the Korean nationalists
worked hard to assemble their
new government. The two su-
perpowers occupied the country
as agreed, and set up provisional
governments in their zones.

But soon the mutual distrust
between the two powers drove
them apart, taking the two zones
in Korea with them.

The United States developed
South Korea into the capitalist

power it is today, and the USSR
steeped North Korea in the ide-
als (or lack thereof) of Stalin’s
autocratic socialism, including
the essential “worship” of the
leader, Kim ll Sung. ‘

Essentially, foreign interfer-
ence set the countries up for a
civil war—just like the UN did
in Vietnam, which we also had to
clean up.

It seems that the world be-
lieved borders could be created
anywhere, at any time, regard-
less of a country’s organic na-
ture. The Korean War drove the
two sides further apart via Line
of Demarcation, setting the gov-
ernments up for further struggle.

Unfortunately, while many
people are conscious of history
repeating itself, they are often
naive about learning from the
mistakes that fuel the process.

Einstein once said, “The deﬁ-

nition of insanity is doing the
same thing over and over again
and expecting different results.”

So now we fast-forward
nearly sixty years to the present,
where we sit giving thanks for
America’s prosperity and stabil-
ity—amid an act of war similar
to that which started the ﬁrst Ko-
rean War.

The fact of the matter is that
there will be no peace for Korea
until there is war, because as long
as the North Korean government
remains in power, there will
be tension and unease for both
countries bordering the DMZ.

Whether or not we like it,
should war break out again, the
United Statesvbecause of its
commitment to South Korea—is
obligated at least to intervene
and ensure that the war comes to
a safe, just conclusion.

The United States needs to

Traveller founders reunite andraise money

After reuniting to commemorate its founding, the heads of Traveller look back on the program is history

By Jarrett Brotzman
COLUMNIST

On November 13, the Travel-
ler Steering Committee had the
opportunity to meet and . have
lunch with Traveller’s founders
and the families of the students

to a full-service, paid job run-
ning seven nights a week with a
two dispatch vehicles and a full
contract with Goff Transporta-
tion.

over $5,000 in commemoration
of their friends for Traveller.

At Traveller, we have greatly
enjoyed watching the program
expand over our short time here.

The deaths of Adam. and Kristin were without a doubt one of the most

painful experiences for W&L in recent history. As a university com-

munity, we never again want to experience that loss.

in whose memory the program
was founded: Kristin Shelton ’05
and Adam Burchett ’02.

From humble origins as an
unfunded, all-volunteer program
operating with geology depar-
ment vans out of what is now
Holekamp Hall, the program we
know as Traveller has expanded

At the reunion, we met Emily
Taylor ‘04‘ and Baxter Lee ‘02,
close friends of Adam and Kris-
tin and two of the founding mem-
bers of the Traveller system.

Not only did they welcome us
and share memories of their close
friends, but the group of alumni,
family and friends also raised

~

However, we felt compelled to
write something uncharacteristi-
cally somber in the typically up-
beat Christmas issue of the Phi.
The families and friends of
Kristin and Adam returned to
campus a few weeks ago to com-
memorate the tenth anniversary
of their tragic deaths and to hon-

or their memories-

Their reunion and the ongo-
ing growth of Traveller demon-
strate the memories and positive,
institutionalized legacy left be-
hind by this tragedy.

There have , not been any
deaths due to drunk driving at
Washington and Lee since their
passing, and this is no coinci-
dence. Traveller has, in large
part, ameliorated the decision
of whether or not to drive after
drinking.

As W&L students, we know
that Traveller is just one call
away. We are fortunate and privi-
leged to have a system in place
to help us get home safely, one
which was established well be-
fore we arrived here.

However, attending this re-
union reminded us why we
joined Traveller in the ﬁrst place:

to help our friends get home
safely on nights when we should
not be driving.

Unfortunately recently some
students seem to think that
Traveller is a right, rather than
a privilege. We are writing to
remind everyone that this is not
the case.

The deaths ofAdam and Kris-
tin were without a doubt one of
the most painful experiences
for W&L in recent history. As a
university community, we never
again want to experience that
loss.

Maintaining Traveller re-
quires copious amounts of time,
money and energy.

Currently, Traveller employs
nearly 60 students, a faculty ad-
visor and numerous bus drivers
with the oversight and generous
funding of the Board of Trust-

ﬁnish what it starts. While it is
uncomfortable for us to involve
ourselves in another war that
could easily have been prevent-
ed years ago, we must suffer the
repercussions of our actions and
get the job done quickly—and
well.

ees.

In just dollar terms, the sys-
tem costs over a quarter ofa mil-
lion dollars a year to operate.

That being said, we sincerely
hope that students choose to uti-
lize this awesome resource and
never forget why it came to be.

Please don’t drink and drive.

Please be responsible when
you are out.

Please watch over each other,
and please be respectful to your
fellow students on Traveller.

We hope you enjoyed Christ-
mas Weekend and have a great
break.

Finishing with a tie at sectionals: how incredibly boring

No, this is not an article about

show choirs, or ‘glee’ clubs.

Leggings: not pants & why tobuy Nike

ﬁred of homogenous feminine clothing choices, Ali Greenberg ‘tries to buck the trend

By All Greenberg

This is a call to arms for the

in our daily wardrobes, have
quickly gained momentum and
are very close to serious identity

Before I continue, I must ad-

But frankly, I’m not trying.
WE aren’t trying.

  Students cook for peers, professors

Members of SAIL prepare Italian and Greek dishes for members of the W&L community at the International House

By Zoey Ryu
STAFF WRITER

The Student Association for
International Learning, also
known as SAIL, and the Interna-
tional House sponsored a cook-
ing night on Saturday, Dec. 3 for
all students and faculty members
who were interested in learning a
few recipes for their next home-
cooked meal.

First-years Allie Weiss and
Sarah Streeper, who share cu-
linary interests, volunteered to
teach guests how to make Four
Cheese Baked Penne Pasta and
Tabbouleh Salad. The dishes
were served with fresh garlic
bread.

Several Washington and Lee
students and faculty members
from various departments joined
the two chefs in cooking. Each
person received a task such as
chopping, sauteeing and mixing.

As the delicious smell and
warm aroma ofthe melted cheese
and garlic from the International
House kitchen permeated the
house, the students made con-
nections beyond the classroom.

The dinner took an hour and
a half to cook. Once the timer in
the oven beeped, everyone gath-
ered around the dining table, ate
and conversed overia large fam-

ily-style dinner.

This culinary night concen-
trated not only on teaching new
recipes, but on promoting inter-
action among members of the
W&L community. Sometimes a
night spent with people around
_a table of warm food is the
best way to relieve the stress of
dreaded midterms. For the next

event, be sure to reserve a space '

for yourselfand friends under the
title “SAIL Cooking Lesson.”

W&L professors and students will dance the night away on Friday as they compete in --“Dancing with the Professors”

By Holly Suthers
ARTS & LIFE EDITOR

“Dancing with the Stars”
comes to Washington and Lee
in its own rendition of “Danc-
ing with the Professors.” W&L
dancers are hosting the event on
Friday, December 10 at 6 p.m. in
the Keller Theatre in the Lenfest
Center. Professors will be danc-
ing with other professors or with
dance students as they compete
for the championship.

Proceeds from the event
will help fund the W&L dance
group’s attendance to the Ameri-
can College Dance Festival.
Students have attended the con-
ference for several years, which
offers the opportunity to study
with professional dancers and
choreographers. The university
has funded the program in the
past, but decided to cut the funds
allotted to the trip this year.

Money will be raised as votes
for the favored dance duo, either
in cash or by swiping it home.
The organization will have a

swipe machine and drop buckets

for money in the Commons from
Tuesday through Thursday of
this week, as well as the opportu-
nity to vote at the W&L Reperto-
ry’s Concert on Wednesday and
Thursday. Student organizers
and professors alike encourage
all students to take a study break
on Friday to attend the event for
a good cause and for quality ven-
tertainment.

Participating dancers Profes-
sors Harlan Beckley and George
Bent answered questions about
their expectations, concerns and
goals for Friday night:

Phi: Why did you decide to
participate in “Dancing with the
Professors?”

Beckley: I was invited to par-
ticipate by two persuasive stu-
dents.

Bent: It’s a good cause and I
want to support the Arts at W&L.
Plus, I get to dance with Burr
Datz. I couldn’t pass up that op-

portunity.

Phi: Do you have any previ-
ous dancing experience?

Beckley: None whatsoever. I
tried to get out of it, but Stepha-
nie Brown was relentless.

Bent: I have attended FD
[Fancy Dress] for ﬁfteen years.
Does that count?

Phi: Do you have any con-
cerns about the competition?

Beckley: Making a fool
of myself, but I feel pro‘-
tected by two superb danc-
ers: Rachel Alexander and
Stephanie Brown.

Bent: What to do about
all those sequins.

g Phi: What is your fa-
vorite dance style?

Beckley: This question
is too complicated for an
novice like me to answer.

Bent: I love to moon-
walk.

Phi: Do you have any
secret dance moves that

you are going to use?

Beckley: That’s a surprise
that I cannot reveal at this time.

Bent: Are you kidding? All
my dance moves are secretAes-
pecially the Hurricane Hand-
stand. Oh wait, did Ijust say that
out loud?

Phi: How have you been prac-
ticing for the competition? If so,

what do your rehearsals entail?

Beckley: Yes, Stephanie and
Rachel are excellent choreogra-
phers and grueling taskmasters
striving for excellence.

Bent: Rehearsals are lots of
sweating, groaning and untan-
gling oflimbs. Oh, and Burr and
I giggle a lot.

Phi: Which professor will be
the toughest competitor?

Beckley: I am totally intimi-

dated by Burr Datz. _

Bent: Tammy Futrell scares
the crap out ofme. Always has.

Phi: How will you celebrate
if you win?

, Beckley: My wife and I hope
to take Rachel and Stephanieto
dinner.

Bent: Lots of chest-pounding
and ﬁnger-pointing, mostly in the
direction ofTammy Futrell.

Previously undefeated asketball loses in a thriller against Randolph College V

By Kirsten Kyne
STAFF warren

The Generals’ men’s basketball
team fell to Randolph College on
Saturday 68-66, ending its ﬁve-
game winning streak.’The Ran-
dolph WildCats scored the game-
winning basket with just under ﬁve
seconds remaining in the game
when sophomore Colton Hunt hit
a jump shot from the right corner.

»The score had been tied with forty

seconds left after Generals senior
Jason Cimino made one of his two
free throws of the game.

The Generals had led the Wild-
Cats for most of the ﬁrst half, but
the score lead went back and forth
11 times throughout the ‘second
half, with the Wildcats leading
when time ran out. The score tied
up ﬁve times during the second
half as they were exchanging leads.
The Generals’ highest lead was by
11 points in the ﬁrst half.

The WildCats had a higher
shooting percentage from the ﬂoor
(46.2 to the Generals’ 44.1), but

W&L start

the Generals had more rebounds
(38-28). Despite the defensive
superiority the Generals showed,
they were unable to make as many
shots and went 9-for-14 from the
free throw line.

The Generals ’ scoring was led by
junior Jon Guest with 12 points and
6-for-10 shooting with sophomore
Jeremy Adkins following close be-
hind with 11 points. Cimino tallied
4 points for the Generals. ‘

Despite Saturday’s loss, the

. Generals won their ﬁrst ﬁve games,

including a conference win over
Roanoke last Wednesday. Sopho-
more Taylor Gilﬁllan led W&L to
a 75-63 win with a career high 13
points. Adkins hit a three-pointer
with 5:57 left to play which began
the Generals’) 13-2 run in the last
six minutes of the game.

Last year, the Generals lost a
heartbreaker to the Maroons in a
60-59 loss when a Roanoke player
made one of two free throws with

just over ﬁve seconds left in the
game. This year’s win over the
Maroons was much more satisfy-
ing than last year’s.

In the Generals’ third win of the
season over Averett University on
Nov. 27, sophomore Hans Harris

led the Generals in points with 20 ,

points and was 6-for-8‘from the 3-
pointer mark.

Over the past six games, there
have been four different lead scor-
ers, including sophomore J.D. Ey
in the Haverford and Swarthmore
games at the Equinox Classic. Ad-
kins currently leads the team in
scoring. with 63 points on the sea-
son but Ey is well ahead of the rest
of the team in rebounds with 51
(19 offense, 32 defense).

The Generals play again on
Monday night at Ferrum, and on
Wednesday night against the Guil-
ford Quakers at the Warner Center,
at 7 pm.

Wrestling dominates  

Despite a rough ﬁnish Saturday, W&L starts season impressively

By Lizz Dye
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s wrestling
team has had a spectacular season
so far.

At the W&L Fall Classic the Sat-
urday after Thanksgiving, the Gen-
erals faced East Tennessee State
and the Virginia Military Institute.
The team went 16-1 on that day;
the only loss came when two W&L
athletes wrestled each other. In that
match, ﬁrst-year HT Kochinian de-
feated sophomore Brian Ross.

First-year Brandon Stueben
improved his record to 5-2 with

5 pins, and Jordan Yost leads the
team with a perfect 6-0 record for
the season.

Three W&L wrestlers have been
included in the last three weekly
national rankings, which can be
found at d3wrestle. com, including
junior David Dennis, senior Keith
J aworski and ﬁrst-year Jordan Yost.
Yost also became W&L’s ﬁrst-ever
Ursinus Fall Brawl Champion,
as he was undefeated 4-0 at 197
pounds. Jaworski defeated TCNJ’s
#9 nationally ranked Kyle Packard

to advance to the ﬁnals of the Fall
Brawl and come in second. First-
year Eric Fessel also took second.
This was the ﬁrst time ever, that
W&L had three wrestlers in the ﬁ-
nals of this Fall Brawl.

Assistant Coach Mike Bennett
said that “we have an outstanding
young team that looks like they will
change the nature of our program
for a long time.” This is also Head
Coach Gary Franke’s 38th and ﬁ-
nal season with the Generals.

Season ends for football

Post-season awards roll in for Generals football players and coach

By Burl Rolett
STAFF WRITER ‘

The Generals’ football season
ended last Saturday, but it won’t
soon be forgotten.

Washington and Lee (8-3, 6-0),
notched the school’s ﬁrst undefeat-
ed ODAC season on their way to
a berth in the NCAA Division III
playoffs.

Senior and team captain Greg
Kurkis said, “The success we ex-
perienced this season was a prod-
uct of our offensive and defensive
units consistently playing physical,
disciplined football and making big
plays in crucial situations.”

Consistency was the staple of
W&L’s offense this season, which
scored at least 35 points in all six
conference games. The Generals
rushed 3,955 yards this season for
an ODAC record, and routinely put
together long scoringdrives.

An impressive number of eleven
Generals earned ODAC All-Con-
ference recognition for having out-
standing individual seasons.

On the offensive side of the
ball, Kurkis, an offensive lineman,

pulled in two big honors: he was
chosen to thelst team All-ODAC
and, for the second consecutive
year, named an Academic All-
American.

Junior offensive lineman John
Fitzgibbons also made lst team
All-ODAC, as did running backs
Luke Heinsohn, a sophomore, and
Harrison Hudson, another junior.
Heinsohn led the conference with
1,321 rushing yards for the sea-
son.

Junior quarterback Charlie
Westfal and senior tight end Pat-
rick Conley were named to the
All-ODAC 2nd team. First-year
Connor Hollenbeck received an
All-Conference honorable men-
tion.

Hollenbeck was the only fresh-
man from any school to receive
All-ODAC recognition.

The defense also had several
players earn All-Conference hon-
ors. Sophomore defensive back
Jake Pelton, wholed the confer-
ence with six interceptions for the

season, made the All-ODAC lst
team. Linebacker Jesse Jenkins,

also a sophomore, was named to '

the 2nd team, and junior defensive
back John Kavanagh received an
honorable mention.

Head Coach Frank Miriello was
named the ODAC Coach of the
Year after leading the Generals to
their second conference champi-
onship in the past ﬁve years. Miri-
ello became W&L’s all-time win-
ningest head football coach on Oct.
2, passing his predecessor Gary
Fallon with a victory at Guilford.

Looking ahead, the Generals
will return nine offensive start-
ers and over half of the starting
defense next season. Greg Kuris
added, “The amount of experience
and depth the program will be re-
turning next year should lead to
an exciting 2011 season for W&L
football.”

Starting this Friday, Washington and Lee
students will tackle a new Web Registration
process, with changes most students have been
asking for. Perhaps the biggest change is that
students will now be able to register for certain
sections of a course, instead ofjust the course
itself.

“I really like how you can pick the speciﬁc
section that you want,” said sophomore Lizzie
Engel. “So, if you don’t want class until noon,
that’s pretty great.”

However, the University Registrar warned
about the potential drawback of switching to a

class.

Students will also have to steer clear of any
course conﬂicts or taking classes without the re-
quired prerequisites. If a student signs up for a
conﬂicting class or for a class which he or she is
not fully qualiﬁed to take, the new program will
implement a “hard stop,” preventing them from
continuing with registration.

“In the old system, it was easy to get around
the ‘soft-stop’ and preregister for conﬂicting
courses or for courses you did not have the pre-
requisites for,” said Dittman. “Now there have
to be new procedures for a faculty member to

According to Dittman, the old course-based
registration was “designed l3 years ago to last
for two years.” Now that the computer language
the program was written in is becoming obso-
lete, it seemed time to make the jump to a new
program. However, the new program has al-
ready received mixed reviews.

“It’s very different, but it’s not that hard
to use,” said senior Lauren Sturdy. “I really
like how you can pick courses and save them.
However, the disadvantage, for me, is that I’m
in chorus and we’re not allowed to register for
conﬂicting classes.”

According to Dittman, there is “no way” to
override a time conflict in the software; so there
is a paper process that “could be done behind
the scenes.” ’

The new registration will also feature an on-
line drop-add session, instead of the former pa-
per procedure. The upcoming spring registration
will be the last paper drop-add ever, according
to Dittman. However, there will still be a paper
process for late registration.

According to Dittman, the change from
course-based to section-based registration is
in part an answer to students’ criticism the old
system received. Two years ago, committees
of faculty, staff and students began to look at
the outdated system and brainstorm new ideas,
spearheaded by the efforts of Associate Univer-
sity Registrar Barbara Rowe.

Health Center nu

mbeirs may be agoodl sign

The number ofstudents admitted may be going up, but some believe students are just being careful

By Jayna Johns
SPORTS EDITOR

Last October saw the largest number of alco-
hol-related visits to Washington and Lee’s Student
Health Center (SHC) in history. While this sounds
troubling, it may be a positive sign.

Dr. Jane Horton, director of the SHC, said that
September, October, January and May tend to see
the most visits, but monthly averages are about 35,
25, 25, and 20, respectively. September saw a slight
increase at 39 visits, but Octobcr‘s visits jumped
to 57, more than twice the average, and more than
three times a year before. Last year, October only
had 15 visits.

An alcohol-related visit is deﬁned as an over-
night stay either at the SHC or the local hospital,
report of an injury as a result of intoxication, such
as a drunken brawl, students reporting sexual as-
sault or women seeking the Plan B birth control pill
after drinking the night before, said Horton.

While the total numbers are signiﬁcantly higher,
the proportions are about the same. Most visits are
for overnight stays, with a few injury rcpoits, and
a smaller amount of other incidents. First-year stu-
dents are twice as likely as all other classes coin-
bined to be brought into the SHC, and this pattern
continued in October. ‘

The cause ofthe October spike is open to specu-
lation. Horton said that the numbers for November

' dropped back into the normal range. Eighteen stu-

dents were brought to the SHC last year, and only
13 for November this year.

Most students are given a BAC test when they
come to the SHC with an alcohol-related issue,
and this year’s numbers are “typical” of the aver-
age level, which was 0.16 last year and has been
decreasing for the past several years, according to
H oiton. This suggests that students ‘are not drinking
any more than usual.

Dawn Watkins, dean of student affairs at W&L,
believes that the jump in students brought in could
be a positive, showing that students are taking bet-
ter care of each other.

“It is important to not assume that [student’s
drinking] behavior is any different,” Watkins said.

She believes that an increased emphasis on “by-
stander intervention,” an element frequently cited
by Horton as well, has encouraged students to bring
in others who may be engaged in “high-risk behav-
ior.”

“Every bit of our [alcohol] education, across
the board, encourages bystander intervention,” said
Watkins, referencing the current “Green Dot” pro-
gram and the safe-haven practice of the SHC.

The school is encouraging students to be more
active bystanders. She has one message for those

who see someone is in trouble: “Hey, go get your
friend help,” she said.

Crystal Spencer, the head resident advisor for
ﬁrst-years, agrees that others seem to be more
aware of taking care of their friends.

“I would say people have become more aware
of the severity of the issue of leaving someone
alone when they are drunk,” she said. The issue
was brought up during mandatory ﬁrst-year alco-
hol classes, and she believes that the classes “made
[students] more aware of the severity of the issue.”

As a student, Spencer said she does not feel that
more alcohol is being consumed than usual. Wat-
kins agreed, saying that they do know students are
drinking less than they have in past years.

The classes and programs may be getting
through to students, but there may also be simpler
reasons for the increase.

According to both Watkins and Horton, student
events are increasingly being held within city lim-
its, making it easier forstudents to go to the center
due to proximity.

“I see events sponsored in city’ limits as a safe
choice,” said Watkins.

Spencer also mentioned a recent tragedy at a
nearby school that may have affected W&L stu-
dents. A student at Radford University was recently

found dead in his room after a night of drinking.
He was left alone to “sleep it off” and died during
the night because of it. “I think that has raised more
awareness,” she said.

The death occurred on October 15, which may
have been a factor in the spike that month.

W&L has not had an alcohol-related death since
the fall of 2000. In comparison, there were 10 stu-
dent deaths between 1990 and l999, according to
Watkins.

To Watkins, this'means something has gotten
across to W&L students: students seem take care
of each other and take advantage of the resources
provided by the school. '

“For the most part, our students are pretty
smart,” said Watkins. K

Although numbers from last weekend’s Tear
Night will not be available until next month, early
indications are that even though the number of stu-
dents admitted was higher on this year’s Tear Night
was higher than last year’s, overall BAC was down.
Once again, it seems that students are learning to
take care of each other and use their resources.

“appa Sigma Rush by the numbers

  An organization by organization breakdown of rush results at Washington and Lee
The newest brothers look 33' °°"'*"°¥ R'"°""°"'

. STAFF WRITER
forward to spring rushing

By Valaree Tang
STAFF WRITER

While the formal recruitment process may be
over for most Greek organizations at Washington
and Lee, Kappa Sigma will continue to recruit
new members this winter. .

The four men who are currently in the frater-
nity colony have already been speaking with other
first-year men who are interested in joining Kappa
Sigma.

Some of the new members of the colony said
that they joined Kappa Sigma because of the op-
portunities it provided. While the other fraternities
have an established brotherhood, they believe that
Kappa Sigma offers chances for leadership, post-“
graduate and strong alumni networking.

Parker King, one of the founders of the soon-
to-be chapter, is excited about the prospects that
Kappa Sigma has to offer. A Kappa Sigma legacy,
King is now the Grandmaster of Ceremonies, and
is in charge of fraternity rituals and new member
education.

“The biggest selling point in recruiting for
Kappa Sigma is that you can make it whatever
you want,” said King. I

The colony’s Grand Master, or president,
Christian Martine, takes a less aggressive stance
on recruitment. V

“In the end, we’re all Generals. Fraternities are
simply families among friends,” Martine said. “As
a fraternity, all we can do is allow those interested
in joining a fraternity to feel welcome and, should
they not choose us, we will continue offering our
support and friendship.”

To recruit new members, some colony mem-
bers will emphasize what drew them to Kappa
Sigma: opportunity.

_ “For the rest of winter term, however, we will
be allowed to employ rolling recruitment to boost
our numbers with independents and late rushers of
all ages, who may have completely discounted the
entire Greek system but now have an opportunity
to truly make a fraternity their own,” said Grand
Procurator (vice president) and Grand Treasurer 
Yates Wilbum. I '

The colony will also be working toward receiv-
ing the charter for Kappa Sigma, and restoring the
Mu chapter of the fraternity, the third oldest chap-
ter in the fratemity’s history. ‘

The colony will become a chapter once it has
fulﬁlled the requirements mandated by the execu-
tive national board, including community service,
fundraising and writing the chapter’s constitution
and bylaws.

“I am most excited about being able to mold
the Chapter Constitution, where the other found-
ing fathers and I can truly have an impact on the
character of the chapter,” said Wilbum.

The national headquarters will award the colo-
ny a charter once its members have completed the
requirements; the process is not time-dependent.

“It’s a product of how quickly the colonization
process is accomplished,” said Trey Weitzel, Kap-
pa Sigma Area Recruitment Manager, who will be
working closely with the colony to recruit more
members and establish a chapter. “Knowing these
guys, I ’m sure they will be right on top of it. Once
they complete the items on the checklist, they sub- I
mit to the national executive committee, which is 
also the governing body of Kappa Sigma, and it - -
will decide when a colony receives charter.”

Weitzel recruited the current four members of
the colony in the fall.

On the national level, Kappa Sigma is very
excited since the W&L chapter is the third oldest
chapter of the fraternity.

“The headquarters staff, national committee
staff and the alumni are all excited to have it back.
Over 1,200 men have been initiated through this
chapter, so lots of people [are] eager to have that
home restored,” Weitzel said.

The colony is also receiving help from Judge
John Forster, the alumnus advisor and professor
at the law school, and his wife, Jane Lee Forster,
who was among the ﬁrst female students at W&L
and one of the founders of the W&L sorority sys-
tem. The colony is also suppoited by alumni from
both the international organization and W&L.

Associate Director of Student Activities and
Greek Life Teri Cugliari considers Kappa Sigma’s
fall recruitment to be a success.

“Based on the fact that Kappa Sigma has suc-
cessfully recruited new members, is continuing to
attract new members and is moving forward in the
chartering process, their colonization is success-
ﬁil,” said Cugliari. '

Weitzel also considers the operations of the
chapter so far a success, despite having only four
members.

“The fact that we’re back, have very dedicated
guys that are excited to join and are excited to
move forward with the process makes it a suc-
cess. It just takes a few good men to start,” said
Weitzel.

Meet Judy Clarke: W&|.’s famous professor

Law students talk about their experiences with Judy Clarke,“ the professor representing Jared Lee Loughner

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

Jared Lee Loughner, the suspected gunman in
the Tuscon, Ariz. shooting, will soon be appear-
ing in court before a federal judge. Standing be-
side him will be Washington and Lee’s own Judy
Clarke, a professor of practice at the School of
Law.

According to the official criminal complaint
document ﬁled by the FBI, Loughner faces ﬁve
federal charges including one count of attempt-
ing to assassinate Congresswoman Gabrielle Gif-
fords, two counts of attempted murder of a federal
government employee and two counts of murder
of a federal employee. I

In total, l9 people were shot at Congresswom-
an Giffords’s “Congress on Your Comer” event
on Jan. 8. Six were killed, including Arizona Dis-
trict Court Judge John M. Roll and Giffords’s aide
Gabe Zimmerman.

Lawyers and professors all over the country
agree that Loughner could not have hoped for a
better defense attorney than Clarke. Clarke has

' a long history of getting life sentences for de-

fendants who originally faced the death penalty.
Some of her best-known clients include Theodore
J. Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber; Eric
Robert Rudolph, the Atlanta Olympics bomber;
and Susan Smith, a woman who drowned her two
young children in a lake in 1994.

After Clarke was appointed as Loughner’s
defense lawyer, her name began to appear on
all sorts of news websites. The New York Times,
TIME Magazine, CNN and Fox News. are just
some of the organizations that have already run a
story on Clarke.

While the public now knows a signiﬁcant
amount about Clarke as a defense lawyer, the
news media rarely mentions that Clarke devotes
some of her time to teaching young aspiring law-

yers right here in Lexington.

According to law school records, Clarke taught
her ﬁrst class at the W&L law school in the fall of
2006—a course on sentencing law and practice.
She next taught two courses in the spring of 2007,
one on criminal procedure and the other on white-
collar crime. In the fall of 2008 Clarke taught a
criminal law course, and in the springs of 2009
and 2010, she taught a Criminal Law Practicum

‘ and a Criminal Practice Practicum, respectively.

Clarke has made an impact upon many of the
law students who have taken her courses. Third-
year law student Jessica Guzik said that it was the
Criminal Law class that she took with Clarke that
actually sparked her interest in litigation.

Clarke’s former students describe her class as
different from the stereotypical law school course.
Guzik said that she and her classmates partici-
pated in weekly trial simulation exercises in their
class that allowed them to think creatively about
the arguments that they were making and to “use
talents besides simply reading and taking notes.”

Kristina Joyner, a law school alumna and for-
mer student of Clarke’s, said that Clarke treated
her and her fellow students more like colleagues,
sometimes even asking them for advice on cases
that she was working on.

While Clarke may have performed simula-
tion activities with her Criminal Law students, it
was the students in her Criminal Law Practicum
who truly got to learn through experience what it
was like to try a criminal case. According to law
school alumnus Patrick Chamberlain, who took
Clarke’s Criminal Law Practicum in the spring
of 2009, the entire practicum class was divided
into small teams of prosecutors and defendants.
These teams then spent the entire term working on
one case and going through all of the steps of the

' trial process. Chamberlain said that the cases that

were worked on in this course were real cases that

had already gone through the trial process. All of
the evidentiary reports and other documents were
from the real ﬁle of a case that Professor Clarke
had worked on in some capacity.

Not only did Clarke make an impact on her
students through the lessons that she taught, but
some of her students also remember her as being
very willing to talk to them outside of the class-
room. According to third-year law student Bill
Larson, Professor Clarke is a very friendly person
outside of class, something that he doesn’t think
the news media have really picked up on in their
stories about her. Larson said he would sometimes
chat with Professor Clarke outside of class about
various topics, such as their opinions of the biog-
raphy of Joe Biden.

However, Joyner said that it could sometimes
be difﬁcult to talk Clarke outside of class with
great frequency because she was often travelling
between Lexington and San Diego, where she
works in private practice with her husband.

Many of Clarke’s students seem to have had
the same impression of her both as a professor and
as a person. They describe her as humble, genuine
and deeply dedicated to the study and practice of
the law.

Third-year law student Alex Merritt said that
what he remembers most about the class that he
took with Clarke in the fall of 2008 is the farewell
talk that she gave on the last day of class. The talk
was Clarke’s “heartfelt” explanation of why she
thinks criminal defense is such an important prac-
tice because everyone, including those who break
the law, is granted certain protections and proce-
dural rights under the Constitution.

“She is a true believer in American justice,”
said Larson.

Chamberlain said that he hoped Clarke would
have time to come back and teach at the law school
again in the spring, for the students’ sake. How-

ever, Linda Johnson, Director of Law School Re-
cords for W&L, said that Professor Clarke will not
be returning to teach another course this spring.

While she may not be teaching another course
this year, Clarke will surely be keeping more than
busy preparing to defend Jared Lee Loughner in
trial. Some journalists and lawyers have begun to
speculate that Clarke may attempt to use the in-
sanity plea in her defense of Loughner, but some
of her students aren’t so sure about that.

They said that Clarke discussed different as-
pects of the use of the insanity defense in both her
criminal law class and practicum, often discussing
it in relation to Clarke’s work defending Ted Kac-
zynski, also known as the Unabomber.

When asked if he thought that she might use
the insanity plea in the Loughner case, Larson
said that he believes Clarke will consider every
possible course of action.

Guzik said that Clarke does not view the insan-
ity plea as a tactical maneuver that can be used by
defense lawyers to avoid certain legal repercus-
sions, in other words, as a way to duck punish-
ment. She said that Clarke “doesn’t take anything
like that for granted” because she realizes that
one can undermine the entire legal system if they
abuse something, like the insanity plea.

Joyner said that the news media seems to have
hyped up the use of the insanity plea because, in
actuality, the use of this type of defense is actually
quite rare. According to The Jurisprudence of the
Insanity Defense by Michael Perlin, lawyers have

only tried to use the insanity defense in less than ‘

one percent of felony cases.

Loughner will next appear in court, along with
Clarke, for his preliminary hearing, which has
been scheduled for Jan. 24.

The Executive Committee forecasted a
busy bill of winter term objectives at their
weekly meeting on Tuesday night.

President Scott Centorino explained
that the group hopes to piggyback off of
a successful fall term and continue to im-
prove student self-govemment.

“I think everyone, from every part of
campus can look at the things we’ve done,

ies like the Student Judicial Council. The
Dean of Students would be able to enter
a UBA proceeding with less prior knowl-
edge of the case at hand. Centorino said
this move would eliminate the appearance
of bias in the UBA.

“[The proposal is] our ﬁrst priority be-
cause without it, we’ll have the status quo.
Withit, we’ll have an appellate process

“Considering what we ’ve done so far, things a Z0t.0f A
people didn ’t think we could pull off I ’m excited about the

possiblities. ”

§gg§ ggntgringl Eg ﬂrggiggm

and ﬁnd a bunch of things to be happy
about,” he said.

Among the laundry list of goals for the
winter was to pass the University Board
of Appeal reforms past a faculty vote in
the coming months. The reforms, which
the EC painstakingly worked on in the
fall, have been an important step toward
improving student self-govemance.

The reform proposal outlines UBA
procedures more clearly, guarantees ba-
sic rights for anyone involved in a hear-
ing and forrnalizes why a lower body’s
decision can be overturned. This means
that any student involved in a UBA hear-
ing will know exactly what to expect in
the proceeding, know exactly what the
are allowed to do for their case and know
that the UBA will only overturn a lower
body.’s decision for bad procedure, not for
difference of opinions on the case.

Even more, the proposal changes the
Chair of the Board from the Associate
Dean of Students to the Dean of Students.
The Associate Dean of Students is very in-
tertwined in the proceedings of lower bod-

for hazing, sexual assault and conduct de-
cisions that makes sense and one we can
all count on and trust. It gets us one step
closer to living our values,” he said.

The Student Affairs Committee has al-
ready approved the reforms, and, now, the
EC will focus on swaying the faculty.

The UBA deals closely with Student-
Faculty Hearing Board, which handles
cases of sexual harassment on campus.
The EC believes that gender relations
pose some of the biggest problems on
campus. The UBA reforms and the SFHB
reforms that the group passed in the fall
have helped to improve the judicial pro-
cesses involved with gender relations is-
sues. But Centorino hopes to look at and
address the issues from different angles
during this semester.

“I want to take a step back and look at it
from the bigger picture. What becomes of
it, I’m not sure yet. But considering what
we’ve done so far, things a lot of people
didn’t think we could pull off, I’m excited
about the possibilities,” he said.

More directly affecting students will

be the EC’s work with Dining Services.

Sophomore representative Jack Apgar
has led the Coup de Co-op Committee to
regain co-op money for students who miss
dinner. The group has already won $5.85
for student-athletes who miss dinner be-
cause of practice and $125 extra food
debit for all students with a Marketplace
meal plan.

However, the EC hopes to regain the
co-op dinner option for the general stu-
dent body, believing it is not only the
athletes’ problem. Apgar will continue to
collect information to help their case for
when Dining Services reviews their bud-
get in March.

As a ﬁnal triumph, Centorino boasted a
lower-than-average number of honor cas-
es for the fall term. The EC nonnally sees
around eight to ten honor cases a term.

Centorino said he thinks that there isn’t
an underreporting problem and genuinely
believes students are taking the Honor
System more seriously.

'“It’s hard to say why it’s been a quiet
year. It’s promising, of course... that be-
ing said, we’re always looking to improve
the system and modernize it,” he said.

He indicated that a few higher-proﬁle
cases that happened last year might have
helped to keep the Honor System and the
EC on students’ minds.

More on the winter term agenda in-
cludes ensuring at least three more Chick-
ﬁl-A visits, purchasing a memorial bench
for the late Granvil George and running
successful elections and officer transi-
tions.

Coming home
from college

A nice remix to normal life

By Campbell Burr
c 0 L u M N l ST

Imagine being woken up with a kiss and a mug of coffee, walking into
your own clean bathroom without ﬁip-flops, and returning to ﬁnd your bed
already made. Picture trying on every piece of clothing in your wardrobe
before going out and coming home to ﬁnd them hung up and put away.
Imagine sitting in a well-decorated room by a crackling ﬁre and watching
your favorite football team with a big bowl of homemade popcorn. Home
sweet home.

Though living at home is more luxurious than living in a crowded
dorm room, it has its restrictions. Here are some frustrations I faced over
Christmas break: -

I. Where are the pizza and Oreos? Raiding my fridge at the end
of the night is nothing like wandering through Graham-Lees on a food
hunt... unless you keep baby carrots, pickles, and soymilk in your dorm
for late-night snacking. No wonder I was so skinny in high school.

2. “Comb your hair.” “Less eye make-up.” “That dress is too short.”
The commentary doesn’t stop. At a family brunch, I was scolded at least
ﬁve times by my parents and grandparents for wearing a skirt too short. I
can only imagine what they would say about my theme-party outﬁts...

3. “How’s school? Do you have a boyfriend? How’s your room-
mate? How are Mom and Dad holding up?” Literally the same conversa-
tion with every person I come across. And telling people you have a single
room is not as easy as you think. At most schools, singles are reserved for
socially-incompetent freaks, not half of the freshman class. Would saying
I have “lots of boyfriends” come across the wrong way? And considering
the empty nesters go out more than I do, I’d saying they’re holding upjust
ﬁne.

4. Where’s Traveller when I need it? Unreliable Mapquest direc-
tions, ﬁghts over whose turn it is to be the designated driver and speed
traps all become a headache. If only Traveller would extend its ﬁve-mile
radius and serve students over break. Well, that may be a bit more compli-
cated than learning to read a map.

5. My grandparents were out later than I_was on New Year’s Eve. I
wish I were kidding. Thank you, curfew.

6. You feel sorry for your friends when you hear about their college
experiences:

“All of our parties are really small.” “It’s hard because all of the up-
perclassmen have parties but I don’t know any of them.” “The boys are
so nerdy!”

And how am I supposed to comfort them? “College is only consid-
ered the best four years of your life—guess it’s seriously downhill from

'99

Over break I went to a party hosted by a Georgetown student. The

- boys were dressed in button-down shirts, pretty similar to what the typical

W&L student would wear out. On the way home, my friend who attends
another university couldn’t get over their outﬁts. “They all looked like
little Ken dolls!” I had forgotten that boys at other schools dress like slobs.
Yet another reason to love W&L.

7. The world no longer revolves around me. When I’m late, my
whole family is late. At school, I may press snooze a few too many times
and come to class ﬁve minutes late. Rude? Yes, but at least I’m not drag-
ging three other people late to class with me. At home, my parents expect
me to be punctual. Sometimes I fail to meet that expectation, like over
break when I arrived ten minutes late to a 35-minute church service and
missed my dad’s reading.

8. I’ve watched every episode of Real Housewives, read a few
trashy novels, shopped at every boutique and department store and am...
running out ofthings to do. I could always get more than 12 hours of sleep
a night and continue to make one errand take up the entire day. Maybe I
could straighten my hair for the ﬁfth time today? So little to do and so
much time.

9. Catching up with friends isn’t quite as entertaining as it used to
be. As much fun as it is to hear about John, Will and Jake, I’ll never know
these people! Why do I care that John blasts Enya from his dorm room and
thinks no one can tell when he is checking himselfout in store window re-
ﬁections? Hey, on second thought, let me meet this guy. We seem to have
more in common than I thought.

10. “You’re dressed like a mom.” Thanks, I’m actually wearing her
clothes. Fortunately and unfortunately, my mom and I are the same size
in clothes and shoes and share closets when I’m home. This is a blessing
because between the two of us, we have every color and style of sweater
and skirt which makes getting ready easy. The only negative? My mom
looks better in our clothes than I do—self-conﬁdence boost!

Now I’m back in Lexington re-teaching myself how to make a bed,
fold clothes and get a life.‘l get twice as much done with half as much
time. I feel twice as energetic with half as much sleep. And I’m having
twice as much fun going out half as many nights. Though living in a tiny
dorm cell and doing all of my own chores without allowance can be ex-
hausting, life is good.

Shooting sprouts from a gun

Opponents of the Second Amendment use fundamentally incorrect
reasoning to frame their arguments

By John Paul Beall
COLUMNIST

Before reading this article any fur-
ther, please take a moment of silence for
the victims of the tragic shooting in Tuc-
son on January 8.

In light of this incident, the topic of
gun control has once again emerged to
the forefront of political debate. People
cite this incident as the classic example
of the dangers of a

effective in that it is a republic with an
idea that the law reigns supreme: a great
generator of civic and social stability in
the United States. When a person com-
mits a crime, however, he or she is es-
sentially outside the law. The conclusion
then is that legality does not concern the
lawless. So ifa law is established to con-

control have misunderstood this idea as
for radicals, who wish to remain armed
should the government become tyranni-
cal. While some radicals do hold this po-
sition, this is not an overarching factor.
The Founding Fathers understood
what it meant to have self-deterrnina-
tion. The ability to act for oneself is
~ liberty; dependence on

gun. By extension,
they demand more
stringent regulations
for gun control.
There are many
reasons why calling
for more expansive
gun laws is the in-
correct answer to the

When a person commits a crime, however, he or she
is essentially outside the law. The conclusion then is

that legality does not concern the lawless.

another person or entity
is to be robbed of one’s
liberties and rights. Mur-
der is to be robbed of the
right to life; theft is to be
robbed of property; and to

be disarrned is to be robbed '

of the ability to guarantee
one’s rights for oneself, a

tragedy of murder   liberty all on its °Wn- 1”‘

and crime, but one
thing must be made perfectly clear: to
claim that a gun is the cause of violence
is to strip the murderer of responsibility
for his own actions and to dishonor those
who were robbed of irreplaceable life.

This seems to be a trend long in the
making where the Jeffersonian ideals in
government have since faded away. Self-
determination has given way to the belief
that if there is a problem that needs solv-
ing, one lobbies the government, who
will set up an extensive and inefﬁcient
bureaucracy to regulate the matter. This
is perhaps a residual effect from the era
of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s alphabet soup
of programs and bureaucracies during
the Great Depression, yet even he never
believed that all the programs would
ever be permanent.

But crime is the one major talking
point that advocates of gun control use
to persuade the public. America is very

trol the supply of guns, the only realm
in which this will work is in the realm
of the lawful citizen. The good are dis-
armed in a vain effort to disarm the bad,
an unintended but unfortunate result of
such policy.

Many World War II buffs know that
after the war ended and the Japanese
battle plans were discovered, it was
found that Japan had never intended a
full-on land invasion of the contiguous
forty-eight states. One reason why isthat
the Japanese tacticians knew that most
American households owned arms for
their own defense. This would have ren-
dered a land attack on the United States
nearly impossible to execute, because
the invasion would have needed to be
fought on a block by block basis.

This illustrates the crowning point for
those who favor the 2nd Amendment:
personal defense. Advocates of gun

stead of being able to act
in self-defense, people are forced to wait
for the police to arrive and act for them.

To describe the track record of the
I00-year lifespan of gun control policies
across the globe would make this article
insufferably long and dry, so‘ summary
will have to sufﬁce. It does not matter
which country is examined. The policy
is always the same, and so is the output.
If ever in a discussion or heated argu-
ment, the best question anyone can ask
to advocates of gun control is if they can
delineate their supposed answer to the
problem.

The bottom line is that if someone
attempts to establish the connection be-
tween guns and violence, there is an es-
sential logical error. Violence can come
around for a variety of reasons, from
poverty, to social unrest or even bad pol-
itics, but violence never grows from the
barrel of a gun.

Differences between men and

women in relationships

Without his target demographic as a base, Stockton Bullitt ventures

into unknown territory...

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

Writing opinion afticles this kind of
year is particularly difﬁcult. I like to think
that I cater to a certain demographic of
reader. This works relatively well for me
because as long as I pound out a weekly
article of the same bullshit metaphors
and references to ESPN and movies, I
know that I don’t have to try particularly
hard to write an effective column.

However, there is a stretch of about
two months or so where I have a feeling
a certain proportion of my target demo-
graphic does not exactly have the time
to read my column. I would say that for
the next... oh... seven or so weeks, this
certain portion of the target demographic
will have more important things to do
than read why I think Caleb Hanie is the
perfect mixture of two of the better mov-
ies of the late 1990s (in other words he
is the almost famous version of Willie
Beamon). If you didn’t understand that
reference, there’s a chance you are not

"among the demographic of very busy

people right now.
So since I can’t write bullshit articles

. about sports, I will write an article about

a subject that this certain absent demo-
graphic does not particularly care about:
relationships.

. There are certain aspects of relation-
ships that are hard to prepare for. I wasn’t
really sure of what these were, so I did a
little research at Leybum and found out
some interesting little nuances about re-
lationships at Washington and Lee that
frankly I did not see coming.

First and foremost, there is a whole
new world of television to encounter
once you enter into a relationship. Yes,
ladies, you have to watch way too many
sports and usually we hog the television
anyway, but you have been rolling your
eyes at the atrocious shows we watch
for quite a long time now. But, wow, it
is painful to watch Bravo, MTV, ABC
Family, and E! on an endless loop.

After all that pain and hardship how-

and sells out

ever, I got a deﬁnite feel for who I do and
don’t like in your world of television.
I do like Kim and Phaedra from “Real
Housewives of Atlanta.” Let’s be honest,
Kim is the perfect "comeback for all the
countless years of negatively portrayed
minorities on television. I don’t know

‘how she does it, but she overshadows

anything the Basketball Wives ever do.
I don’t like Chelsea Handler, but that’s
only because I have a penis. I do like
anyone on the “Millionaire Matchmaker”
who isn’t the Millionaire Matchmaker. I
mean, is it really that hard to ﬁnd boring
and shallow people in Los Angeles?

I don’t see how people pay her mon-
ey. I don’t like Aria from “Pretty Little
Liars.” Really? Ifl was hooking up with
a teacher while I was in high school, I
would ﬁnd a way to smile once in a
while. I do like Janelle from “Teen Mom
2.” She and Ray J are easily the two most
entertaining people in the world right
now. Why do a paper on Roe v. Wade
when you can just forward your teacher
clips ofher? Finally, I don’t like “Skins,”
but that’s because I’m not in the 13-16
age range. That show. gets a bad rap from
critics and anyone in college because
it so clearly panders to that target age
range. I guarantee you that every middle
school girl in America is thinking about
trading in her Twilight backpack for any-
thing that has to do with the new MTV
show that shamelessly gloriﬁes what pre-
teens imagine high school to be like and
what teens think they are actually going
through. '

Another little nuance of dating is all
the damn thought process that goes into
a dinner and a movie. Girls, you don’t
want to look fat when ordering, but you
also want to order something expensive
enough that he’ll know that he can’t be
cheap with you. That being said, you
can’t order something too expensive
because there’s always the off chance
that when the check comes, he’ll look at

you and raise an eyebrow. Guys, on the
other hand, have to worry about ordering
something that makes them look like a
man, meaning that the sorority rush date
diet of pasta and salad is not eligible. Un-
fortunately, pasta and salad also happen
to be two of the cheapest options on the
menu. Masculinity costs money, espe-

‘ ‘cially at The Bistro.

The movie also presents a problem, at
least for the guy. There’s no way the guy
ever talks the girl into seeing “The Ex-
pendables” or “The A-Team.” Usually,
the choices come down to whatever-Dis-
ney-is-throwing-out-there or the barely
watchable romantic comedy of the mo-
ment. Best case scenario, you get “Wall-
E” or Natalie Portman for 90 minutes.
Worst-case scenario, you get two hours
of Miley Cyrus.

Then there’s music. Ladies, I know
that maybe it’s a little weird that the pre-
dominantly suburban, Caucasian popula-
tion of W&L prefers to listen to the same
music that they do in Queensbridge and
Harlem, but that is no comparison to hav-
ing to listen to the horror that is Taylor
Swift. 1 know that most of Bruce Spring-
steen’s songs sound the same, but c’mon
- the only difference among any of Tay-
lor Swiﬁ’s songs is the name. Also, there
has to come a time when Taylor realizes
that all the problems that befall her in all
her relationships are clearly her fault, and
don’t try and retort that she realized it
with that guy who played the werewolf.
The only beneﬁt I received from any of
Taylor Swift’s music is it more ﬁrmly
entrenched my belief that John Mayer is
my role model. i

Okay, so there you have it: I origi-
nally and wholly summed up all the
differences between men and women. ‘I
would share the rest with the missing de-
mographic, but I have a feeling that they
will not be thinking about women until
late March.

Need a way to waste time while standing up? Pat Smith explains the glory of getting a workout playing video games

By Patrick Smith
COLU M N I ST

If you don’t count the eight hours of Call of
Duty Black Ops I play daily, one could hardly call
me a “gamer.” For those of you out there who
love video games but get a bunch of crap from
your parents about being a waste of space on the
couch, I have the solution: Xbox Kinect.

Over break, I had the pleasure of playing co-
pious amounts of Xbox Kinect, but I hate when
people call Xbox Kinect a video game. I like to
call it an “experience.” The reason it is not a video
game is because there are no controllers. You must
stand, and it’s exhausting as hell.

The ﬁrst time I played it with my friends from
Jersey, we played for like four hours straight. The
next morning I could barely get out of bed because
I was so sore.

Every parent out there should encourage his or
her children-to play Xbox Kinect. lt’s fun as the
dickens and is also a great work out. The amazing
thing about the “experience” is how accurately the

character on the screen mimics your movements.
For example, ifyou pick your nose in front ofthe

ly challenging game Kinect provides is the soccer
goalie game. It requires you to stay in the power

best part about the Xbox Kinect is the video re-
play they show you at the end of each game. The
console puts together a slideshow of everything
you did in that round of play. The things you will
see may haunt you.

your legs start to burn as well as your eyes, be-
cause blinking is not an ‘option.

The first time I played the soccer goalie game,
I made the mistake of wearing blue jeans and a
polo. Needless to say, I could not walk right for
a few days.

The Xbox Kinect is like the Wii on steroids
and the badass version of the PlayStation Move.
No stupid handsets or nun-chucks to mess around
with. Just a man and his thoughts... and a smart-
phone.

The Xbox Kinect is not for the shy or reserved
type of person. In order to excel in this experi-
ence, you must go all out and leave everything on
the table. It’s kind of like drinking a Four Loko
at noon.

All in all, get the Xbox Kinect. If you are wor-
ried about playing too many video games, start
playing the experience. Invest in the Xbox Kinect
and get your life moving.

On a side note, I hope everyone had a won-
derful tear-weekend and didn’t get arrested like
Snookie did for not being able to ﬁnd the beach
while she was on the beach.

Critterpants are ruining W&L

Ali Greenberg enlightens the student population of the fashion do is and don ’ts of cripper pants and cowboy boots

By Ali Greenberg
C0 LUM NIST

Last time I asked us to consider real pants, but I
must now ask us to stay away from a certain breed.
While I generally see both sides to every clothing
story, there really just isn’t an argument that can
be made in favor of so-called “critter pants.”

A hideous take on a perfectly normal pair of
khakis with repetitive embroidery of lobsters,
anchors, palm trees and yes, even tridents, these
pants exemplify all that is wrong with the south-
ern country club culture and boys who still rely on
their mothers to pick out their wardrobe.

While pants are the main casualty, other items
of clothing are not immune. Those critters spread
quicker on this campus than Tear Night hook-up
stories, leaving belts, shorts, blazers, skirts and
bags victims in their wake. But for the frat stars
with stock in Vineyard Vines, I grant you a free
pass for neckties.

However, if it is your blazer that, is covered
with these stupid animals, then you officially have
no excuse; I’m sorry, but life is not Foxﬁelds. I
know some who come to the critters’ defense,

saying that they are “kitsch” and therefore accept-
able. '

However, I’d be willing to put money down
that most who partake in this trend at our school
are not doing so ironically, because let’s face it,
Washington and Lee doesn’t really do irony.

But, is there ever a proper time to wear these
offensive pants? YES!

I’ll set the scene: our charismatic and hand-
some frat star wakes up. The sun is shining, and
he heads to his closet. It’s Memorial Day weekend
in the City, where he has been working a sick in-
ternship at a hedge fund that his dad hooked him
up with. He is about to catch the jitney out to the
Hamptons, where he has summered since he was
three and is going boating with a friend from prep
school for the day.

Pleased with his plans, he pulls the critter pants
off the hanger, throws them on with a polo and is
actually dressed appropriately for the day’s activi-
ties. Unfortunately, being the douchiest looking
guy on the water is a common and unavoidable

side effect.

If you want to look classy, classic and put to-
gether, try a monogram instead. There is really
nothing chicer, and it harks back to a time when
clothing actually represented your personal style
and when the type of hat you wore said a lot about
you. Not that any guy who would normally wear
critter pants has anything interesting to say about
himself.

Speaking of classics, let’s get on to the ladies.
There is nothing I love more than classic Ameri-
can style, and there is nothing more American
than embossed leather, waxed cotton and cozy
ﬂannel knits. -

I want to be clear that I have ‘no problem with
the concepts of cowboy boots and Barbour jack-
ets... but let’s get serious. You are from Jersey, and
the closest you have been to a ranch is when you
reach for the low-calorie dip at srat lunch.

My cowboy boots are vintage and fabulous and
I love them, but I am a blue-blooded Yankee, so
they don’t make much sense. Girls tend to come to

school here and suddenly transform into southern
belles, some even developing a twang.

As further evidence of this phenomenon, I am
wearing a camouﬂage duck-hunting jacket as I
write this, even though I am a vegetarian who has
never hunted a day in her life. i

We have all adopted- these styles as just that:
style. But when it comes to dressing the part all
I have to say is that if you are afraid to get your
Barbour jacket dirty, you don’t deserve to wear
itwand getting beer spilled on you at Hooterville
doesn’t count.

W&L is neither the English countryside nor the
Alamo (sorry, Tex-Lex), and I think that ifwejust
come to terms with the fact that the majority of us
are posers; then we can all still wear our boots and
look a little less pretentious.

Maybe the Derby Days Task Force can lend us
some legitimacy and substitute drunk powder-puff
for drunk mechanical bull riding, or make the girls
ﬁsh outside Pole 3 for the cooking contest.

We all certainly dress the part.

Unwanted Visitors?
Keep them out for good.

STAFF WRITER

Part I.

Their names were Harvey and Oswald.

I use past tense because our two resident mice met
their timely demise [1 la Megan Daily and organic peanut
butter about three days ago. Pests will inevitably reside
in our off-cainpus houses. Because let’s face it—while
brimming with charm, personality and history, these old
structures are the opportune places for nesting grounds.

Evidential support for a mouse problem:

1. Droppings. Feces. “Night soil.” More than you
can shake a stick at. Google the image ifthat helps.

2. Often they substitute your mug of tea for their
personal Hungarian bath.

3. Those “dust clumps” on your bed at night...

*The latter two only apply if you reside at 101 North
Randolph Street... and if you’re named Megan.

So what do you do? In the most scientiﬁc terms:

1. Deep Throat said to “follow the money.” I
say follow the droppings. You can identify their general
hangouts by the... errn. .. excrement clusters.

2. Once identiﬁed, place mousetraps in these
places. Now thanks to Walmart employee Bob, our house
could write a dissertation on mousetrap effectiveness.
The Sandbox recommends “No touch, no mess” as our
mousetrap of choice. Spread some peanut butter as the

Local competition encourages
household recyclin

Rockbridge County promotes sustaina le lifestyles for locals and students

By Holly Suthers
ARTS & LIFE EDITOR

Rockbridge County is hosting its ﬁrst Re-
cycling Challenge this month to encourage the
community to “go green." The Rockbridge
County Recycling Department is sponsoring a
contest to see improve household recycling.

The contest began on Jan. 9 and will end on
Feb. 19. The winner will be determined by the
household with the most trash bags ﬁlled with
sorted, recyclable material.

The county has made several attempts to
improve sustainability in the area. The parking
garage at the Rockbridge County Couit House
on Randolph Street contains premium parking
places for hybrid vehicles. and many ofthe lo-
cal schools have created student groups to pro-
mote a “greener” lifestyle.

Washington and Lee has contributed signif-
icantly to this movement, as well, especially by

using biodegradable paper products and add-
ing dozens of recycling bins around campus.

While Lexington, especially, has improved
its sustainability, local ofﬁcials believe that
there are many other ways to recycle that have
not yet been employed in the area. Old or no
longer operating televisions, computers and
cell phones are in fact recyclable and do not
need to be thrown out. Many companies, such
as Apple and Dell, have “buy back” programs
where the company will buy back an old elec-
tronic for a discounted price, while local shel-
ters willingly accept older, but still functional,
gadgets.

Electronics are especially important to re-
cycle because of the waste that the products re-
lease in landﬁlls. Electronic waste, also known
as “e-waste,” accounts for up to 70 percent of

the heavy metals in landﬁlls and 40 percent of
the total lead, which allows toxic substances to
leach into the soil and groundwater.

Many household cleaning products are also
recyclable. Plastic and paper containers may
be reused, while the excess substances are usu-
ally water—soluble and may be washed down
the drain. The Recycling Center is hoping to
inform and teach local residents and students
about the importance of maintaining an envi-
ronmentally friendly lifestyle.

In order to register for the challenge, please
see a Rockbridge County Recycling Center
employee at one of the local recycling center.
The winner will receive a $111 gift card to
Walmart.

Women’s b-ball has strong week

Head women is basketball coach Mandy King scores 100th career win at W&L with 76-56 triumph over S VU

By Alexander Maragos
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee women’s basketball head
coach Mandy King earned her 100th career win
with a 76-56 drubbing of Southern Virginia Uni-
versity last night at the Warner Center.

The Generals played stiﬁing defense and shot
52 percent from the ﬁeld against an overmatched
SVU squad.

King, the winningest coach in program his-
tory, led the Generals in a rout over the county ri-
val, denying the Knights their ﬁrst win in six tries
against W&L. The Generals gained an early lead
and rolled into a 38-18 advantage at halftime, fu-
elediby a 16-6 run over the last seven minutes.
The defending ODAC champions held a tight
grip on the game, leading by as much as 30 mid-

way through the second half.

The Generals were offensively and defensive-
ly dominant in the paint, earning many of their
points underneath the basket while forcing many
Knight 3-point attempts. The Generals’ zone de-
fense did a good job of contesting the Knights’
outside shots, allowing them to shoot only 34 per-
cent from the ﬁeld.

The Generals were led on both ends of the
floor by junior forward Becca Bolton, who scored
26 off the bench, and junior guard Meg Ingram,
who had 19 points, 4 assists and 5 steals. They
were joined in double ﬁgures by junior forward
Katy Wilson, who had 10 points and 7 rebounds.

The Knights, on the other hand, were plagued

by 16 turnovers, many of which were caused by
the full court press that the Generals employed
throughout much of the game. The Knights had
a lot of trouble bringing the ball up the floor, and
found themselves often hastily avoiding a shot-
clock violation. This marks the second game in a
row where the Generals played strong defense.

SVU was led by junior forward Nicole Tol-
man, who had 15 points on 5-of-9 shooting, in
addition to a game-high 9 rebounds. Much of the
Knights’ scoring was generated by second chance
points, as they rebounded very well—30 team re-
bounds to the Generals’ 31.

The mood was light on the Generals’ bench,
as the Knights were never down by less than 16

Coming off the S VU win, women is basketball rallies to beat Eastern Mennonite, 67- 71

By Kelsy Mccraw
STAFF WRITER

A second-half rally led the Washington and
Lee women’s basketball team to a 67-61 victory
over the Eastern Mennonite University Royals on
Saturday afternoon at the Warner Center.

Even though the Generals (10-4) outshot the
Royals (9-6) by 17 total attempts in the first half,
their 22.9 percent goals-per-shot—attempted left
the Generals trailing 33-21 at the halftime buzzer.
The Royals shot 15-for-29 on the ﬁoor.

Junior forward ‘Kari Ann Pfannenstein ex-
plained that the ﬁrst half did not live up to the
Generals’ expectations for themselves. A half-
time regrouping proved necessary.

“We all knew going into the locker room that

we needed to pick up the pace, get our defense on
track and play with more intensity,” she said.

The refreshed team emerged from the locker
room for the second half, making 56.7 percent of
their attempted shots and holding the Royalsto
just a 37.9 percent. /1

“We came out with a newfound vigor,”/l’fan-
nenstein said. ‘ 

W&L took its ﬁrst lead of the day with 15:14
left in the match.

A string of fouls late in the second half seemed
to slow their momentum, leading to W&L’s big-
gest deﬁcit ofthe half at 55-61. But the Generals
would not let up.

“We just kept our heads cool and decided to
control what we can control and not worry about
the other team or the refs,” Pfannenstein ex-
plained. ‘

With 2:48 ‘left, sophomore forward Katy Wil-
son dominated under the net, making six back-to-
back rebounds that propelled the team to a 63-61
lead in the last minutes of the game. According
to Pfannenstein, Wilson’s detennination helped
keep up their energy.

“She always crashes the board hard and of-
fensive rebounds give us added momentum,” she
said.

After a three-pointer by senior guard Allie

points in the second half.

Following her 100th win, Coach King, now
in her 8th season, received flowers and shared
hugs with her players. She also earned an ovation
from the crowd when her accomplishment was
announced. The Generals rode a 3-game winning
streak into their Jan. 22 match-up against confer-
ence opponent Eastern Mennonite.

Long at 1:03, the Royals failed to answer the next
seven points scored by W&L. The ﬁnal buzzer
declared triumph for the Generals.

The game marked the second meeting of the
two teams for the season. The Generals lost the
ﬁrst game 69-70 in overtime.

The Generals return to action on Tuesday
night at 7 p.m. against ODAC foe Virginia Wes-
leyan University.

Men is basketball struggles in a home loss to conference rival Hampclen-Sydney College, falling 11-5 in the season

By Mike Decembrino
STAFF WRITER

Rhythm was the name of the game on Wednes-
day evening, and the Washington and Lee men’s
basketball team could not ﬁnd it as they fell to
the Tigers of Hampden-Sydney College 72-66 at
the W&L Warner Center. Despite a high-energy
crowd and “Pack the Stands Night,” the Generals
could not take advantage of the Tigers. W&L held
the lead only once throughout the game and never
recovered from a slow start that led to only four
points in the ﬁrst 12 minutes. ‘

With 3:33 left to play in the first half, sopho-
more forward J .D. Ey completed an old-fashioned
three-point play to bring the Generals within ﬁve.
This started a 7-0 run that cut Sydney’s lead to one
point at 20-19. Neither team made a three-pointer
in the ﬁrst half with W&L blanking on seven at-
tempts and HSC missing ﬁve. When asked about

the ﬁrst half, Coach Adam Hutchinson said, “We
were moving about a half second too fast, a half
step too quick.” This lack of rhythm carried over
to the second half.

The Generals trailed 23-19 to begin the second
half, but the Tigers pulled ahead to make it 30-22
with 17:45 to play. The ﬁrst trifecta of the game
came 6:23 into the second half when Harrison
George of the Tigers connected from downtown
to put Sydney up 10 points. This three-pointer
began a 10-2 run capped oﬁ" by Andy Fox’s fast
break dunk to make it 44-29 with 12:32 to go.
George went 3-for-3 from downtown and 7-for-7
overall from the ﬁeld in the second half to ﬁnish
as the game’s leading scorer with 26 points.

Senior guard Jason Cimino hit W&L ﬁrst three-
pointer with 11:55 to go in the game. Although

W&L is second in the ODAC in three-point per-
centage at .343, they only shot .167 against the Ti-
gers. Coach Hutchinson attributed this decline in
three-point efﬁciency to the team’s lack of rhythm.
He said, “We were a half step off all night offen-
sively.” The theme of being a half step off carried
over to ﬁeld-goal percentage as W&L shot only
.365 compared to HSC’s .500 mark from the ﬁeld.
The Generals cut the Sydney lead to ﬁve points
with 25mseconds to play but could not squeeze out
the victory. Ey led the Generals with 13 points
going 6-for-9 from the ﬁeld and grabbing seven,
rebounds. Junior guard Jon Guest added 12
points, while ﬁrst-year forward John Rice ﬁnished
as the game’s leader in rebounds with eight.

The loss drops the Generals’ overall record to
11-5 and its conference record to an even 4-4. Af-

ter winning 10 of their ﬁrst 12 games, the team has
hit a rough patch, dropping three of their last four.
The Generals did not hit their magic number of
70 tonight, as they are 9-0 this year when scoring
70 or more points. “This hurts but I’m not disap-
pointed in the guys. I thought the effort was there
tonight,” Hutchinson said. The Generals return to
action on Jan. 26 at Emory and Henry and they
have a chance for redemption against Hampden-
Sydney on Feb. 14.

Wrestling ﬁnishes tough Week

The Generals competed in two meets in as many weeks, each one bringing tough competition for the young team

On Saturday, Jan. 15, the Washington and Lee
wrestling team ﬁnished ﬁfth out of seven teams
as it hosted the W&L Invitational at the Warner
Center. Senior Keith Jaworski was named the
toumament’s most outstanding wrestler.

Washington & Jefferson won the tournament
with 79.5 points and was followed by the Ap-
prentice School in second with 75.5 points, then
NYU (59), West Virginia Tech (52), W&L (43.5),
Scranton (33.5) and Southern Virginia (10).

Jaworksi won his MOP award after winning

thechampionship of the 157-pound weight class.
First-year Eric Fessel, 141 pounds, also won his
weight bracket. Junior David Dennis, 165 pounds,
ﬁnished third in his weight bracket.

The next Saturday, W&L wrestling fell to 1-6
overall and 0-4 overall in the Centennial Confer-
ence with losses to Stevens (49-3) and the 14th
ranked Merchant Marines (51-0) and host Mc-
Daniel (39-9).

The loss to Stevens began with a rough start as
the Generals forfeited the ﬁrst two weight classes

and fell behind 25-0. It wasn’t until junior David
Dennis got W&L on the board with a 5-0 win that
the Generals saw some promise. Unfortunately,
the Generals then had to forfeit three of the ﬁnal
four weight classes to end the competition against
Stevens.

The Generals were limited by four forfeits
against USMMA. The closest individual match

A was a 10-8 loss by ﬁrst-year Eric Fessel to James

Beshacla at 141 pounds. Senior Keith_Jaworski
followed with a 6-3 win over Torin Lehmann at

157 pounds and ﬁrst-year Daniel lgel added a 11-

5 win at 165 lbs to pull within a 15-9 score.
W&L travels to Johns Hopkins on Saturday,

Jan. 29 for a dual match against the Blue Jays.

First book

W&L English professor
celebrates book release

PHOTO COURTESY OF WASHINGTON AND LEE

The English department’s own Jasmin Darznik
celebrated the launch of her first book, “The Good
Daughter,” last Thursday with a reading for Wash-
ington and Lee faculty and students.

The‘ reading was the first on her book tour, which
includes 17 stops this month alone. The memoir will
be published in 12 countries. -

Darznik was born and spent the ﬁrst three years
of her life in Tehran, Iran, but left during the 1979
revolution. She settled in California with her Iranian
mother and German father.

Her mother’s life in Iran remained largely a mys-
tery to Darznik until one day when she discovered a
photograph that began a journey. “The Good Daugh-
ter” is a vital part of this journey, but perhaps not
the end.

“A photograph hidden, forgotten, and now
found,” read Darznik from her novel. She discovered
the photo by accident when visiting her mother. In it
a 13-year-old girl wore a beautiful gown, make-up,
and a wedding veil. This girl was her mother.

Darznik said that at ﬁrst her mother was angry
and would not speak of the photo. But in the next few
months, she started to receive cassettes that told the
story of her mother’s past life in Iran.

“it’s not a conversation we could have had‘ face-
to-face,” said Darznik, who explained the culture of
secrecy regarding family matters in Iran. She said
that most of her mother’s friends in America would
probably hear about her past marriage for the ﬁrst
time in the memoir. '

The second excerpt Darznik read described her
mother’s wedding day. Some of the words, she said,
were taken directly from her mother’s cassettes.

Lili, her mother’s name in the novel, was picked
by a man 15 years older than she to be his bride. The
event was a mixture of celebration on the part of her
family, but confusion and fear for Lili. She had her
ﬁrst child, a daughter, at 14. When she divorced, a
rare occurrence in l950’s Iran, she had to give up
the child.

“We were a world of two, my mother and I, until
I started turning into an American girl. That’s when
she began telling me about The Good Daughter.It be-
came a taunt, a warning, an omen,” reads the synop-
sis on the back cover. Until she discovered the photo
in her early 20’s, Darznik did not know that the other
daughter actually existed. _

In her memories of Iran, it is always a summer
afternoon for Darznik and she remembers a girl who
used to come to her grandmother’s hair salon. At the
time she did not know that this girl, Sara, was her
sister. .

She said she has not seen her sister since she was
a child, but they have been corresponding. Meeting
her again might be a matter for another memoir, Dar-
znik said.

But as of now, her next book will center on a poet
in l950’s Tehran and will be more autobiographical
than her ﬁrst novel.

Darznik teaches English and creative writing at

' W&L. She received her PhD from Princeton and

Washington and Lee’s EC of-
ﬁcially recognized the Community
for Financial Freedom as a student
organization in its weekly meeting
last Tuesday.

CF F Co-Executive Director Kate
Donnelly (’l 1) and Treasurer Cindy
Rivas (’ 14) presented the EC with a
breakdown of their new non-proﬁt
organization that plans on providing
personal ﬁnancial advice to the Lex-
ington community.

In an email, Vice President Bill
Larson explained why the EC be-
lieved the organization deserves of-
ficial recognition.

“C FF provides students an oppor-
tunity to use the ﬁnancial skills they
develop at W&L to help low-income
members of our community. The EC
supports students using their talents
to help those who are less fortunate,”
he said. ,

Donnelly said that “pay-day
lending” entraps many low-income
members of the local community in a
vicious cycle. Businesses with man-
tras like “Check Into Cash” provide
paycheck advances at astronomical
interest rates.

Those who use these businesses to
get quick cash to pay their bills can-
not afford the higher interest rates as-
sociated with these services. Rates of
18 percent fall at the low end of the
lending spectrum; some businesses
have been known to charge over 300
percent.

According to Donnelly, citizens
will then continue to borrow from
the businesses to pay back their ever-
increasing debt. She said that such
practices can crush personal credit

' scores, making it hard to rent apart-
ments, buy cars or get hired.

“It damages a lot oftheir potential

and capability to improve,” she said.

The CFF hopes to step in and help
correct the community’s personal ﬁ-
nancial problems by creating a coun-
seling group that will provide one-
on-one. advice, seminars and other
types of ‘ support. Local ﬁnancial

ing, providing‘ an outlet for students
to apply the knowledge _and skills
they learn on campus.

Unlike Student Consulting,
however, the CFF will be ﬁled as
a 50l(c)3, a state-recognized non-
proﬁt organization.

\

“The CFF’s commitment will give people a real

chance of success and make a diﬂerence in the

community. ”

DAVID emsr, President and CEO, Cornerstone Bank

agencies, like ComerStone Bank and
Wells Fargo, have already begun to
offer themselves as resources to the
group as they get started.

President and Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer of ComerStone Bank David
Grist said that the CFF will provide
an opportunity to help debtors stop
borrowing money that is more ex-
pensive than it’s worth. I

“The CFF’s commitment will
give people a real chance of success
and make a difference in the commu-
nity,” he said.

The organization is well on its
way to achieving its ﬁrst goal after
receiving $1287.30 from the EC’s
winter budget allocations. Donnelly
and Rivas estimate that the group
will need around $2000 to get start-
ed. Now, the group must look into
receiving the proper training and
certiﬁcation to become active in the
community. _

Once it does, the organization will
operate similarly to Student Consult-

  

 

I-'

This ﬁling will be important for
the future of the group as it plans
to eventually become a lending in-
stitution. Unlike other lending busi-
nesses, it will provide loans at lower
interest rates and issue the interest
rates into savings bonds to further
promote their customers’ ﬁnancial
freedoms.

In the EC meeting, Donnelly es-
timated that the CFF would need
around $37,400 to start a lending
business. She said they are currently
researching state and national grants
to ﬁnance the endeavor.

CFF Co-Executive Director Allie
Long (’1l) expressed interest in en-
couraging other universities in simi-
lar communities to do the same.

“There’s an opportunity to make
this a model for other universities,”
she said.

The organization began as a
collaboration of the efforts of two
separate independent studies. The

‘Credit Study 2010: A broad assess-
ment of ﬁnancial issues facing low-
income individuals in Rockbridge
County and recommendations for
new policies and practices.” Two
Virginia Military Institute cadets,
Tyler Brown and TD Hoover, under
the guidance of W&L Professor of
Economics Harlan R. Beckley, are
currently working on the second in-
dependent study. They are attempting
to quantify the extent of the problem
in the area.

Beckley said that the involve-
ment of both universities will only
strengthen the community’s view
of the group and is one of the CFF’s
main objectives.

“This is a rare opportunity where
the two universities are collaborating
onajoint effort,” he said.

The organization’s constitution
explains under their goals and ob-
jectives that they hope to “promote
positive community-student and
cross-campus involvement.”

Donnelly said the group has al-
ready made contact with other local
non-proﬁts to help advertise and pro-
mote their services to the communi-
ty. She says that Habitat for Human-
ity has been a key member in their
efforts.

“By using those resources in the
community, we will be able to reach
out to more people,” she said.

The CFF is currently recruiting
new members on an as-needed basis.
Anyone interested should contact
Donnelly.

“lt’s all in the beginning stages,
but it’s very exciting,” she said.

Falling out of love with the Lilly

Lilly Pulitzer is time in the spotlight has come and gone, so Ali Greenberg gives the clothing line a proper obituary

By All Greenberg
C 0 L U M N I S T

Before I dive into this undoubtedly controver-
sial topic, I must put forth my preemptive apology
to all my friends, sisters, classmates and any other
female on this campus.

What you are about to read may upset you; it
may hurt your feelings or cause you to hurt my
feelings, and for that I am sorry. It’s just that this
needs to be said.

Lilly Pulitzer used to be sold at Stein Mart.
Have you ever heard of Stein Mart? Exactly.

This brand was once inventive, then tacky, then

‘ defunct, and now wildly popular yet still. . .tacky.

I respect Lilly Pulitzer, the woman, who took
an idea (make a dress to hide the stains incurred
by selling juice in Palm Beach) and made it into
an empire.

It used to be, and arguably still is, the deﬁnitive
brand of Palm Beach, lending it some legitimacy.

But let’s think about that for a second and con-
sider who actually lives in Palm Beach. Exactly.

I’m not saying Lilly is necessarily ugly, al-
though some of those print—makers have got to be
fans of Hunter S. Thompson.

I’m just saying that the brand is kind of boring.

Not in the sense that the dresses aren’t bright or
fun, but they simply arejust too predictable.

Not convinced? Go into Lee Chapel during Ori-
entation Week. It looks like .Ioseph’s Technicolor
Dream Coat inthere.

What I do ﬁnd interesting though, is that some-
how no two girls are ever wearing the same dress at

you looked Christmas weekend? I haven’t forgot-
ten. I haven’t given up hope.

So here are some alternatives:

1. Buy a white Lilly dress. Generally better fab-
ric and construction-especially the eyelet, with the
added beneﬁt of not having to worry about getting
sick of the ﬂamboyant monkeys on your behind

the same (‘cause hon-
“"‘e'“’5 Not convinced? Go into Lee Chapel during Orienta- 65”” We get
like they . enough of
all ha“? tion Week. It looks like Joseph is Technicolor Dream 91056 0“ the

tectable . 2. Buy a
I-Ill)’ Fa‘   Lilly agendaf »
dar pre— coaster/mug/

venting them from ever matching.

Every girl that walks by during Spring Term
looks like an Easter Basket, which is great and ab-
solutely adorable, but only when it’s Easter, and
you are prepubescent.

These dresses are overpriced and they underper-
form, and I know we can do better than this. l’ve
seen us do better than this. Remember how cute

etc. PRECIOUS! Photo frames are like the natural
habitat of neon tigers. Like squirrels to sweaters.
(That last part was an inside joke.)

3. For those who absolutely must wear Lilly

‘ loud and proud, here is an idea. Buy a pair of box-

ers in your favorite print and have them cut into
your sorority letters. Look how creative and origi-
nal you have suddenly become!

I have a friend who owns no less than 16 Lil-
ly Pulitzer dresses, and let me tell you, she rocks
them. They look great, totally her style and very
ﬂattering.

But she buys Lilly with tact, and it doesn’t hurt
that she used to work at a Lilly store.

The key with Lilly is wearing the dress and not
letting it wear you. Those prints can be untamed,
and if you don’t have the moxie to pull them off,
you end up looking like you drank the Kool-Aid. . ..
and then threw it back up onto your dress.

So for those of you ladies who have yet to put
me on their Billy Madison “People to Kill” list,
remember what Coco Chanel said about the next
time you open your closet, “Look for the woman in
the dress. If there is no woman, there is no dress.”

The beneﬁts of joining ROTC

By Michael Bender
8 TA F F W R IT E R

Need money for tuition, books, or, just pizza and
video games? Army ROTC provides opportunities
for excellent ﬁnancial aid and beneﬁts.

In return for a dedication to serving their coun-
try, Cadets become eligible for scholarships and
other forms of ﬁnancial aid on top of receiving ba-
sic stipends and allowances. Washington and Lee
students have the opportunity to participate in the
AROTC program if signed up prior to the comple-
tion of their sophomore year.

AROTC Cadets can apply for 2, 3, or 4 year
scholarships which cover full tuition or room and

board in the case that tuition is already covered by
some other form of ﬁnancial aid. Eligibility re-
quires four years active and four years reserve duty
along with a short application process. Although
no scholarship is guaranteed, the at-

money for attending during their summers.

The Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP)
is another great opportunity for Cadets to earn extra
money and receive further training. SMP Cadets

' Alumnus Michael Bender reports on both the ﬁnancial and personal gains from joining the Army ROTC program

for tuition alone at W&L, the ﬁnancial beneﬁts
offered to ROTC Cadets provide a great deal of
breathing room to students and families paying for
college. I
Now, for many students, con-

tributes consistent with students ac-
cepted to W&L qualify most as great
candidates.

Regardless of whether Cadets
receive scholarship beneﬁts or not,
AROTC provides them with monthly
stipends and other allowances to cover

the Army offer career opportunities
in a variety of ﬁelds, it pays as well
as nearly any other starting position
for college graduates. For example,
a newly commissioned Second Lieu-
tenant, right out of ROTC, stationed
in the DC Metro area would earn
approximately $56,000 per year, ac-
counting for salary and allowances. Factoring in
average health care costs and other beneﬁts that all
military personnel receive adds several thousand
dollars more. '

These ﬁgures are similar to the base salaries for
highly competitive starting positions in that area,
such as ﬁrst-year ﬁnancial analysts or consultants.

  ' Defendingthe Knicks and Obama

Stockton Bullitt shares two embarassing personal facts: he secretly roots for the Knicks and still likes Barack Obama

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

I spend an inordinate amount of time defending
why I’m a fan of the Los Angeles Lakers.

Being that I’m not from Los Angeles and the
Lakers have had one of the best records of the last
ten years, my basketball fans are pretty dubious of
my relationship to the team.

I try to counter with statements like, “I defend-
ed Kobe through the rape trial” and “I was a fan
of the Lakers even when we (to properly show al-
legiance, one can always use the first person plural
pronoun when referring to the favorite team) were
so bad that our best hope was to blow a 3-1 lead to
Phoenix in the first round of the playoffs.” How-
ever, since I like equally successful and annoying
teams in other sports, mostly, my friends just scoff
and remind me of my inferior fan-hood.

I held on strong to the argument until this bas-
ketball season started. In my decade and a half long
marriage to the Lakers, I never thought that there
would be someone else. i I

And then Mike D’Antoni and his seven seconds
in heaven offense came into my life.

Since October, I have been a closeted Knicks
fan. I went to one of their games in Madison Square
Garden. I have a man crush on Danilo Gallinari. I
even bought a Raymond Felton jersey.

However, because I’m publicly a Laker fan, I
have to root for the Knicks from the fringes. I “ac-
cidentally” happen to catch all their highlights, and
I wear my Raymond F elton jersey only in private
so I do not attract too much attention.

See, even though I will still root for the Lak-
ers and always pledge allegiance to them, they are
simply not as fun to watch anymore.

Most of my life, even before they acquired
Shaq, there was something exciting about watching
the Lakers. They always drew me in, and I always
had a reason to use any means of access, including
Fox Sports Paciﬁc, to watch some of their games.
However, there’s this new team in my life (the
Knicks) that is far more attractive and fun to root
for, despite their inferior record.

So, even though .I will never tell my friends

.(who are too illiterate to read this article anyway)

about my secret love for the Knicks, I will watch
them from the shadows, enjoying the wonder that
is the Amare-led pick and go.
‘What did I learn about myself from this whole
ordeal? I am an incredibly shitty sports fan.
Although I undoubtedly know more about

sports than you (yep, I do, let’s just not argue about I

it), I do not qualify under any of the criteria that
makes for a quality sports fan.

If my team is doing badly, I do not wallow
in misery for months on end. Instead, I just start
watching another sport (in 2005, the teams I liked
were so bad that I watched countless hours of com-
petitive eating on ESPN2).

Although I know more about college football
players in the country as a whole, I couldn’t name
my favorite college football team’s entire offensive
line. .
By the way, ladies, the reason why your boy-

Sorry Mom, but

I have been putting this article off for quite some
time now, but before I say anymore, I would like all
of you to know that I am in fact 21 years of age,
which means that I am much cooler than you are.

So, if you have not already ﬁgured it out, my ti-
tle pretty much, speaks for itself. I love beer. Word
of advice for the millions of ladies who read my
columns: beer is a fantastic gift.

I love American style lagers, pilsners, ales,
brown ales, golden ales, Hefweizens, stouts, IPA’s,
malt beer, ice beer...you name it; I have tried it
and loved it.

A very wise man once told me that there hasn’t
been a beer he has tried and not liked. I embrace
this saying and try something new every whenever
I have the opportunity.

There is so much about beer that I love. I love
the taste, the look, the variety and, most important-
ly, the fact that it gets you drunk.

You are all probably thinking that I am an alco-
holic, but that is far from the truth. I always drink
responsibly and prepare for safe and sober trans-
portation (Editor’s Note: Empirical research has
shown that “always” is not technically correct for
this sentence). I just love the stuff.

The ﬁrst time I stepped foot into the Washing-

friend doesn’t remember your anniversary is
because at Washington and Lee, every SEC fan
spends all his long term memory on backup play-
ers for their favorite team. ,

Basically, when it comes to sports, everyone
else besides me seems to value loyalty and devo-
tion above entertainment and enjoyment. .

The opposite is true when it comes to politics.

I have been on the Obama bandwagon practical-

ton remains an insider, partisan government, and
all the invested hope and change seems to‘ have
been bought up by Goldman Sachs.

Nowadays, it certainly isn’t cool to be an Obama
fan. .
Republicans right now have either stopped read-

ing entirely because I_’m talking about Lenin 2.0 or.

are smirking to themselves and rereading the last
paragraph, squealing in delight at all of Obama’s
supposed failures.

Basically, when it comes to sports, everyone else be-
sides me seems to value loyalty and devotion above

entertainment and enjoyment. The opposite is true

when it comes to poltics.

Democrats, the six on
campus at least, are all
telling me to shut up
and keeping talking
about basketball.

Still, I will attempt
to do what no one out
there seems to " want

to do: defend Barack’ I

  ‘ Obama.

ly from the start. I was introduced to bipartisanship
during his 2004 keynote address at the Democratic
National Convention. I made him my “official dark
horse candidate of the future” after his 2004 speech
following his Senate victory in Illinois. »

I even started heavily campaigning for him afte
I dumped the whole “Bill Richardson for President”
ﬁasco around December 2007. I’m not an Obama
expert by any means, but I think you can call me a
season ticket holder.

I followed the guy through the height of his
popularity, when not only was it cool to follow
Obama, but you couldn’t be cool unless you had
some association with the hottest presidential can-
didate since John F. Kennedy.

During the good ole days, people gave you high
ﬁves for canvassing, and somehow getting the
“Hope” poster on your t-shirt was an almost guar-
antee to get you laid.

These were times when people said, “I’m not
Republican. I’m a libertarian.” Oh wait, they still
say that? Well, more of them did around mid-
2008.

During the election season, Democrats respond-
ed to Obama the same way Knicks fans responded
to their team’s winning streak in late November
and half of December:_after nearly a decade of out-
right incompetence, this was the dream; this was
the hope; the future could be nothing but consis-
tent, enjoyable victory.

And then January came.

For Knicks fans, it was the return to mediocrity
and the remembrance that D’Antoni doesn’t know
the Italian word for “defense."

For the nation of newly crowned Obama fans,
the bandwagon felt more cluttered than the Beijing
subway, so people started jumping ship like a keg
of Jamesonjust rolled off.

Mortgages were going under. People were los-
ingjobs. And Obama hasn’t ﬁxed anything. Worse,
for the last two years, he hasn’t gotten even a frac-
tion of his original agenda accomplished, Washing-

ton Street Purveyor I damn near collapsed. My
eyes shot open and I realized two key points about
my life: this is what heaven is supposed to look
like, and I’m getting drunk tonight.

This is college after all, right?

When talking to
friends about Obama...well, let’s be honest, no
one really talks about politics in a casual setting
at W&L, and if they do, it’s usually the good ole
“Let me ask you what you think about politics just
so I can pontiﬁcate for hours on what I really think
without you ever getting a word in edgewise” kind
of conversation, and as a dirty Liberal residing in
Lexington, Virginia, those really aren’t the best
talks.

So, when talking to professors, parents, other
adults or fellow students when I happen to notice
an adult watching our conversation about Barack
Obama, the question usually comes down to “Would
you vote for him again?” and “Do you think he can
win in 2012?” Every single non-granola eater who
I have had this conversation with repeatedly gives
me a resounding “No” as an answer for both ques-
tions. I can only mutter “Yes,” and here’s why.

Originally I was going to go with the “It’s all
Congress’s fault” argument, which is easy to do
once checks and balances and quotes from Madi-
son are applied. However, I do believe that Obama
still has a pretty powerful hand in the government
and is responsible for his tenure there. So, here
are a couple of reasons why Barack Obama hasn’t
done as poorly as you might think.

Let’s start with health care.

Remember that monstrosity of a bill that has ru-
ined our country and thrown it into debt?

It’s that bill that nobody wanted passed, yet
Congress jammed it down our throats. I get that. I
listened to rhetoric. I watched Fox News. I did the
research. I see the problems.

But, you have to remember two things: I) he
is the ﬁrst President to get t‘his passed (and unlike
other initiatives of his time, this was his brainchild
and baby) after numerous previous attempts have
failed miserably and 2) you wanted this. Don’t
believe me? Re-watch some of the Presidential
debates in 2008. McCain had to answer every
health care question with “I don’t want a compre-
hensive health care bill, but...” and would ramble

off many different govemment-led initiatives that
pretty much sounded like a health care bill. Talk
to anyone during that election, and they would tell
you that they probably wanted some kind of public
health care.

When addressing the lack of success in com-
pleting his agenda, one important point should be
brought up to defend Obama: since when did we
start actually expecting presidents to fully accom-
plish all the things they said they would do during
an election?

I didn’t hear this complaint during the Bush ad-
ministration, nor did I hear it during’the Clinton
years. Suddenly Obama is supposed to fulﬁll ev-
erything he promised to do during a freaking elec-
tion?

Try holding the EC representatives to their
promises and see what happens.

Besides health care, look at the F rank/Dodd bill,

, the new stimulus, the repeal of Don’t Ask/Don’t

Tell for at least some evidence of success in pass-
ing initiatives.

Don’t like those government initiatives? Well,
that’s what he said he wanted to do during the 2008
election, so I don’t see why Obama’s following
through with those bills is all that surprising.

Try and talk a voter from'2008 out of the F rank/
Dodd bill, which provides much more bureaucratic
oversight to Wall Street. Now, from what I have
heard, the bureaucratic oversight is. pretty much a
waste of everyone’s time. Nevertheless, that’s what
we voted him into ofﬁce to do. Why complain that
he did it?

That was my thought process when my hope in
him was once again restored during his State of the
Union last Tuesday. I didn’t vote for him because
he was going to ﬁx my mortgage or single hand-
edly get us out of the recession. I voted for him
because he can talk the shit out of a speech.

He makes politics worth watching for me.

'I don’t know if “Rise to the Top” is any better
than “No Child Left Behind,” and I’m sure that,just
like the health care bill, you could give me tons of
reasons why it won’t work, just like in 2007 when
I gave everyone who I could ﬁnd umpteen reasons
why the surge in Iraq wasn’t going to work.

With most of his policies, time will tell how
effective they are (I know, I know, I sound like
Bush). .

But this year’s State of the Union address, just
like most of the other ones he’s given, reminds me
why I feel pretty good about 2012. V

I know that Republicans will outspend him 12
to 1, and I know that right now America isn’t exact-
ly on his side. But, how quickly we forget that he

I can give one damn good speech and that he can run

one damn ﬁne election, and when it comes down
to it, he’s at least a smart enough and bipartisan
enough candidate that if we really need him, I’m
pretty sure he’ll make the enlightened decision.

That’s why I’m an Obama fan...and maybe a
Knicks fan, just make sure you don’t tell anyone
on this campus.

I love beer

undying love for oollegians ’drink of choice

plan on doing your Spanish homework after having
a few of these.

One aspect of beer that I have gained an ap-
preciation for, especially in the States, is the beer
gimmicks.

’ I buy into every beer

The Miller Lite Vortex bottle is probably the best

thing since opposable thumbs.

The Washington Street Purveyor has so many
delicious options to choose from it is hard to know
where to begin. Since most ofmy columns are cri-
tiques I thought I would leave you with some sug-
gestions when attempting to try a nice beer.

Just last week I tried the Brooklyn Pennant Ale,‘

and it was phenomenal. ,
The feeling I got from drinking this ale can be

‘closely related to the same feeling you get when

having exact change, itjust all fell into place.
Another brew I particularly fancied was the
Dogﬁsh Head 90 Minute IPA. This one is a bit

heavier and contains about 9 percent ABV. Don’t ‘

gimmick there is and
have no shame for doing
so. It all started with the
vented wide-mouth cans
that Coors Light offers.
That developed into the
“blue mountains” that
we all know and love.

Above all, Miller Lite has won the beer gim-
mick award for the year. The Miller Lite Vortex
bottle is probably the best thing since opposable
thumbs.

I can honestly say that my go-to beer bottle is
the Miller Lite Vortex bottle solely because it looks
sweet as hell. -

The haters try to tell me that the Vortex bottle
is stupid and that there is no scientiﬁc proof the
grooves do anything at all. .

Before writing this article, I personally ran a
scientiﬁc test. I ﬁlled one standard 12 ounce bottle

and one Miller Lite Vortex bottle full to the rim
with water. I proceeded to pour them both out at
the same time. The Vortex bottle consistently out-
performed the standard 12 ounce bottle, usually by
a full second or more.

Argument squashed.

The next development in the American beer
world was the home draught boxes.

Now, I can get fresh and cold beer on tap straight
from my fridge. I can whip out one of the many
sweet beer glasses I collect and ﬁll it with cold and
refreshing draught.

At this point I would like to apologize to my
mother, who has probably already had two heart
attacks and a mild stroke.

Don’t worry, Mother, you raised a good son, I
just happen to love beer. .

To all you beer lovers out there, raise your glass

Duo groups to -perform next Weekend

Ghostland Observatory and White Panda will play to W&L students Friday night at the Pavillion

By Mary Morgan Radcliff
STAFF WRITER

The word for this Friday night at Washington
and Lee is “duo.” W&L will host two acts, both
duos, The White Panda and Ghostland Observa-
tory, this upcoming Friday, Feb. 4 at Fechnay Pa-
vilion. Doors will open at 7 p.m. and the show will
begin at 7:30 p.m. Tickets for the show can be pur-
chased at the Commons all week, as well as at the
door and online at wandlmusictoday.com/Wash-
ingtonandLeeUniversity/calendar aspx.

Fresh on the remix scene is The White Panda,
a mashup duo, who will be opening for Ghostland
Observatory. The duo is made up of Tom Evans
(also known as Procrast) and Dan Grifﬁth (also
known as DJ Grifﬁ) based out of Chicago and Los
Angeles. The two got together in 2009 to combine
their previously solo efforts. The group releases
full song mashups and currently has two albums
out: Versus (2009) and Rematch (2010).

The White Panda has been playing their way
through Canada this past week and will cause quite
a stir by kicking off the show this Friday night in
Lexington. Upcoming shows for The White Panda
include a concert in Cancun at The Gran Melia in
March where they will rock the stage with other big
music names including Pretty Lights, Wiz Khalifa,
Sam Adams and Chiddy Bang.

As for Ghostland Observatory, there is abso-
lutely no other experience that comes close to the
euphoria of being part of one of their performances.
The lights, beats and dance groove blend together
simultaneously to make this band’s live shows an
aesthetically pleasing work of art. To prepare your-

, self for Friday, you must brace yourself and realize

what you are about to experience. Come ready. to
“move with your lover” and sport all things that
glow.

Ghostland Observatory is a blend of electro
and rock that is a distinctly unique and incred-
ibly funky Austin, Texas sound. The group blends
the personalities and talents of its two members,

Thomas Ross Turner and Aaron Behrens. Turner,
the producer, drummer and keyboardist of the duo,

takes a minimalist approach to his music; Behrens, ‘

who provides the vocals and guitar work, has inter-
ests that are formulated by his passion for psyche-
delia and rock. .

The music these two produce will allow you to
enter into a new realm of consciousness: an utter
state of the artistic sublime. Their music has been
commonly described as “syth-

funk” or “electro-dance rock.” ?

Behrens’s lively vocals and gui- -
tar will vibrate with the beats
and hooks generated by Turner
on Friday night. The duo’s mis-
sion is to take their listeners to
a new level of awareness that is
anchored in their own collective
consciousness. i »

I have been lucky enough
to see them perform at some
of the nation’s premier music
festivals, including Coachella
in Indio, California in 2009 and
Austin City Limits music festi-
val, also in 2009.

I awakened to the strength
and enthusiasm of this band’s
fan base when I saw them
perform at ACL. There were
thousands of people channeled
into Ghostland Observatory’s
performance amid a torrential
downpour, me included with
half of my body covered in mud
by the time the show was over.
In addition to this, the Universi-
ty of Texas marching band sud-
denly became an intricate part
of their showcase. The concert

was nearly over, when the back of the stage lit up
and, lo and behold, there stood the entire UT band,
performing “The Band Marches On” from this
funk-rock duo’s third album, Robotique Majes-
tique (2008).

While my past experiences have involved
grooving to the band’s sounds among many other
fans, I am amped about getting to encounter the
“Ghostland Observatory Experience” at W&L.

This time, instead of being surrounded by other
stranger lovers, I will be engulfed by a sea of my
friends in a personal setting that I know I will never
forget.

Fight off winter weather blues

There is no reason to be down this weather, follow these points to stay cool and put.a spring in your step

By Katy Stewart '
STAFF WRITER

This time of year can be tough. Recruitment is
over, thedays are still short, you don’t have Christ-
mas coming up anytime soon and classes are beat-
ing down your back. But don’t worry! Everyone
feels that way, and there are ways to beat the win-
ter blues. The most important thing is to keep your
chin up, but if that doesn’t work, try one of these
tried-and-true methods of boosting morale and en-
joying early February in Lexington.

Liven up your school supplies. When it feels

like all you do is work, work, work, you probably .

just need to spruce up your pencil pouch. The tools
you use should be as happy as they are functional.
For example, whenever possible, I use colorful

pens, fabric-"wrapped paper clips, toile-patterned .

binder clips and ﬂowery post-its. And I’m a big fan
of fun folders. Nowadays you can get pretty fold-

_ ers anywhere. Why not go for the double beneﬁt

of organization and cuteness? My mother regularly
sends me folders because she knows I adore them.
Also, shout-out to my friend Ali Greenberg for
suggesting Lilly in small doses. Homework ﬂies

when I’m using my Lilly highlighters. I promise
she and I are not endorsed by Lilly Pulitzer... al-
though I wish I were!

Get coffee and read a magazine in town. When

down. I call this kind of reading “mental popcorn”
because it’s yummy, light and gives you a little
break.

Do an arts and crafts project. My friend Tricia

is therapeutic. It feels good to stretch your legs and
get some crisp air running through your lungs.

Exfoliate. In the winter, everyone gets dry skin,
so it’s important to slough it away. What better
feeling than that cool tingle of freshly scrubbed
skin? Love it, and love that glow. Go to Walmart,
browse the beauty aisle and pick something that
smells good and comes in pretty packaging.

Invite a friend on a Non-Rush Date. Just be-

to go back to the same apple and sandwich at D-
Hall every day. In fact, post.-Recruitment “rush
dates” are even more fun because you don’t have
to wear your “rush face”— you know what I mean
by that. You can be a real person and complain or
curse if you want. Make a date with a friend in a
different sorority and catch up.

6 - THE RING-°TUM PHI

Tough opponent sinks swimming

T he fourth-ranked men and ﬁfth-ranked women of Johns Hopkins prove to be too much for the Generals to overcome

By Callie Clemons
STAFF WRITER

After three straight wins, the Washington and
Lee men’s and women’s swim teams both suffered
an away loss to the John Hopkins Blue Jays on
Saturday. The women’s team, which is now 8-3 on
the season, fell to the ﬁnal score of 167-89, while
the men’s team, now 8-4, ﬁnished with a score of
146.5-92.5.

“As the fourth-ranked team in the country, we
knew that Hopkins would be a tough opponent,”
said men’s coach Joel Shinoﬁeld. “They deﬁnitely
lived up to their ranking, winning the majority of
the events.”

This meet fell at an important time in the teams’
seasons. With only two weeks left until the con-
ference championships begin, it was one the last
chances for the swimmers to ﬁneytune their strate-
gies and techniques in a competitive atmosphere.

Aﬂer the past ﬁve months of intense training,
the swimmers are ﬁnally entering into a period of
rest. However, many of the swimmers were expe-
riencing fatigue after pushing their bodies for so
long.

“We showed up and had some very high-quality
swims despite the level of fatigue across the team,”

said men’s captain Ryan Hartman. “Hopkins sim-
ply outperformed us.”

The men’s team had four individual event victo-
ries, while the women’s team had three.

Junior Chris Washnock had two event wins: the
200 back (l:56.l6) and the 200 IM (2100.20). Se-
niorlteam captain Brandon Wilder took home the
500 free (4149.92) and junior Brian Stirling won
the 100 ﬂy (52.07).

For the women’s team, sophomore Brittany
Ross scored top place in the 200 ﬂy (2214.82). Ju-
nior and team captain Katie Salvati won the 200

IM (2:21 .49), and ﬁrst-year Lauren Kasoff ﬁnished g

top in the 100 ﬂy (1201.96).

‘ “Overall the teams swam solidly,” said Salvati.
“We know we have done all we can to prepare for
ODACs, and are excited to compete.”

The men’s team returns to action on Feb. 5 to
compete in the Virginia Tech Invitational at 11:00
a.m. in Blacksburg, while the women completed
their regular season with the Johns Hopkins meet.

Both teams will be back in the pool on February
1 1-13 to compete in the ODAC Championships.

Wrestling falls to Johns Hopkins

The Generals battle as injuries plague the young team, affecting their depth and limiting their options during meets

By Mike Decembrino
smrr wnnsn

The Washington and Lee Generals wrestling
team dropped a 45-3 decision to Johns Hopkins
Blue Jays in a Centennial Conference matchup on
Saturday in Baltimore, Md. The Generals only
won one of the ﬁve matches wrestled and lost an-
other ﬁve by forfeit.

Junior Sam Campbell notched the only win for
the Generals at 149 pounds with a 6-0 decision over
Hugh Barham Bahe ofthe Blue Jays.

First-year Dan Igel said of his teammate,
“Campbell wrestled great today; he was probably
our best wrestler of the day.”

Referring to the rest" of the team, Igel said,
“They put up a great effort but really struggled.
Hopkins is a great team; they spend a lot of time
in the weight room, and they’re a tough team to
wrestle.”

W&L forfeited at the 125, 133, 184, 197 and
285-pound weight classes.

The Generals have had signiﬁcant issues with

injuries this year. Two of the team’s key wrestlers,

senior captain Keith J aworski and junior Dave Den-

nis, have been sidelined for the past few weeks.
“We’ve had a ton of injuries, we started the sea-

ent feel for different styles,” Igel said. “But we still
have a lot of great guys left to work with‘ and get
better.”

The loss drops the Generals to 1-7 overall and

son with 17 0-5 in the

nial Conference, made up of teams mainly from the
Pennsylvania and Maryland region. This frequently
makes travelling diﬂicult for the Generals.

W&L, however, will play host to this year’s
Centennial Conference Championships on Feb. 26.
“A lot of people are going to be able to make it back
for conferences,” Igel said, referring to the team’s
lack of depth for much of the season.

As for how he thinks the tournament will go, he
said, “The outlook for conferences is pretty good;
we have a lot of good people we’re just lacking
in depth. So, as far as tournaments go we have a
pretty strong team.”

W&L basketball took
down Emory & Henry

78-6] despite slow start

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

Senior guard Allie Long’s historic
shooting night defused a hot start by Emory
and Henry and led the Washington and Lee
women’s basketball team to a resounding
78-61 win on Saturday at the Warner Cen-
ter.

The Generals are now 12-5 for the sea-
son and 8-4 in conference play.

Long lead the team in scoring with a
career high 22 points, including six three-
pointers. She was 6 for 10 in shots beyond
the are, good enough to tie the school re-
cord for triples in a game.

Long credited her stellar performance to '

her teammates.

“I think [my success] was a mix of both
receiving great passes from my teammates
who set up my shots really well, and also
just being on tonight,” Long said. “A lot of
times shootingjust comes down to whether
or not you are on a speciﬁc night.”

Long also managed to stuff the stat
sheet with four rebounds, three assists and
two steals. She also added a block, for good
measure.

While Long was on ﬁre Saturday, ju-
nior guards and All-ODAC performers
Meg Ingram and Becca Bolton struggled to
ﬁnd their shooting stroke. The two leading
scorers for the Generals average 17 and 13
points per game respectively, but combined
for only 13 versus the Wasps.

Despite the lopsided score, the game
was all E&H for much ofthe first half. I

The Wasps, who are 3-13 for the season
and 2-10 in ODAC play, jumped out to a
quick 5-0 lead and stretched it to 12-7 just
four minutes into the contest. Emory and
Henry senior guard Christina Howard’s 11
points in the ﬁrst 6 minutes of the game
gave the’ Wasps enough of a cushion to
maintain the lead with 8:07 to go in the ﬁrst
half. ‘

The defending ODAC champs never
panicked.

Ajumper by Bolton tied the game at 25-
25 with eight minutes to go in the halfnand
the Generals never looked back.

They proceeded to go on a 20-1 run to
end the ﬁrst period and’ sent the Wasps to
the locker room facing a 45-26 deﬁcit at the
break.

“We did a really good job keeping our
calm despite their quick lead,” Long said.

Junior guard Allison Sublett takes the ball down the court during
Saturday's game against Emory & Henry. Sublett put up 7 points.

“Sometimes we get really tight when
teams we are supposed to beat start off
with a lead, but today we kept our com-
posure and played like a team the rest of
the game.” '

An 8-0 run in favor of the Generals
started the second period, making matters
worse for Emory and Henry. The W&L
women would eventually stretch their lead

.to 31 points with just under nine minutes‘

to go.

The Wasps managed a 21-8 run to end
the game, helping to make the ﬁnal score
a little easier on the eyes, but W&L still
went home with a needed conference vic-
tory.

W&L‘s depth and rebounding tenacity
were key in defeating the undermanned
and undersized Wasps.

Nine different Generals scored in the

contest, and they dominated the boards,

outrebounding their opponents by a 44-29
margin.

In addition to Long’s 22 points, the
Generals were paced by sophomore for-
ward Katy Wilson’s 12 points and nine re-
bounds and senior center Felice Herman’s
10 points and 6 boards.

For Emory and Henry, freshman guard
Jalan McPherson led the team with 19
points, while Howard ﬁnished with 13
points and seven rebounds. Freshman
guard Jo Beth Wright also netted 13
points.

The Generals win erased the bad mem-
ories from their performance on Tuesday
as they lost to Virginia Wesleyan 59-47.

W&L only shot 37.5% from the ﬁoor en .

route to putting up a season low for to-

tal points and could not overcome a 20-2 ‘

Marlin run that ended the ﬁrst period and
stretched into the second. '

Junior forward Kari Ann Pfan-
nenstein led the Generals with 16
points in that game while Ingram
scored 13. Herman netted nine
and picked up six rebounds.

However, nobody could stop
Wesleyan’s junior forward Kris-
ten Blalock, who ﬁnished the
game with 27 points and nine re-
bounds.

The women have only eight
games left for the season before
they begin playing in the ODAC
tournament. Long was clear about
what the team wants to accom-
plish this year.

“Our goals are to win the

ODAC again and to make it to the
sweet sixteen of the NCAA play-
offs,” Long said. “We think this
is achievable if we play our best
every game and take it one game
at a time.”

Revisions
released

New policy would shrink
SFHB, add guidelines for
sexual assualt cases

By Paige Gance
STAFF WRITER

The Ofﬁce of Student Affairs released proposed
revisions to the Student-Faculty Hearing Board sec-
tion of the Student Handbook last Tuesday, the re-
sult of a review called for by President Ruscio over
a year ago.

The SFHB hears cases of student conduct that
include non—Greek hazing, harassment, discrimina-
tion, retaliation, and sexual misconduct. The most
signiﬁcant revisions have been made to the last cat-
egory.

Student groups like End It have pressured the ad-
ministration to make changes to the sexual assault
section of the handbook. End It originated from a
Women’s and Gender Studies seminar that focused
on the issue of sexual assault.

Eric Gehman, president of End It, believes that
the new proposal is an important step, but that more
could be done to improve the policy.

He said that the current proposal needs more
speciﬁc sanction guidelines and deﬁnitions of what
constitutes certain types of sexual assault. Currently,
the sanctions for almost every act range from con-
sultation of the board to dismissal, except for rape,
for which the only sanction is dismissal.

“Students need to know what is expected of
them,” said Gehman. End It had submitted a draft
to the Office of Student Affairs with speciﬁc ex-
amples of each offence and were told that it would
-be used as a template for the revisions. However,
Gehman said, “what they released for comment was
essentially based on the recommendation of an ad-
hoc committee commissioned by the president last
year.”

End It is promoting a meeting next Thursday
at 7 p.m. for all students and faculty to voice their
comments and concerns about the new policy. The
agenda will include a review of both the policy re-
leased for comment and the one recommended by
End It, with the goal of encouraging student support
for further changes. -

The revised policy released by the Ofﬁce of Stu-
dent Aﬂ°airs contains some key changes from the
original. The size of the SFHB is reduced from eight
faculty members and eight students to just four fac-
ulty members, four students and one administrator.

There is also a sizeable addition of text concern-
ing sexual assault. According to the proposal, “the
Executive Committee will, in its process of nomi-
nating students, elicit the participation ‘of stake-
holder groups on campus that may not be normally

represented on the EC, including sexual assault pre- g

vention and response groups.”

The revision also clariﬁes situations in which
both parties are under the influence of alcohol or
other drugs. It says, “it is the responsibilityof the
person initiating physical sexual contact to obtain
consent,” and also that the other person must have
the capacity to give consent.

The issue of sexual assault at W&L has been
pushed to the forefront in recent years by a combina-
tion of statistics and student initiative, including the
new Green Dot program for bystander intervention.
The administration is also considering adding a one-

_credit mandatory course for ﬁrst-years on matters of
honor and civility.

According to the ﬁnal report from the Women’s
and Gender Studies seminar, “At W&L, our Nation-
al College Health Assessment data show that among
undergraduates, in 2009 alone 25.4 percent of fe-
male students experienced sexual battery (touch-
ing against their will), more than twice the national
average; 7.4 percent experienced attempted rape,
at twice the national average; and 6.5 percent were
raped, more than three times the national average.”

Generals’ mental health
Fighting depression at Washington and Lee

By Lizz Dye
srnrr WRlTER

The emotional health of college
freshmen is lower than it has ever
been, according to the results of a
study published in the Wall Street
Journal. And according to the Health
Center, the numbers are no different
at Washington and Lee.

The study was administered by
UCLA’s Higher Education Research
Institute. More than 200,000 ﬁrst-
year, full-time students at nearly 280
U.S. colleges and universities are
surveyed. The response rate is usu-
ally above 90 percent.

According to the study, 52 percent
of ﬁrst-year college students rate their
emotional health as “above average”
or “in the highest 10 percent.” That
number is down from 55.3 percent in
the previous year’s survey. It is also
far below the nearly 64 percent of re-
spondents who gave themselves high
ratings in 1985, whichwas the year
this survey was established.

Conditions at W&L seem to
match up with the national statis-
tics. Christy Barongan from Student
Health and Counseling said that

W&L students reported greater dis-
tress in almost every category than
students at similar schools. She also
said that the counselors see a greater
number of students at the counseling
center than others schools.

Barongan said that W&L’s high
numbers could actually reﬂect posi-
tive change. “Students here may be
more proactive about seeking help,
Barongan said.

But the stress of going to college
can also create an environment that
leads to more difﬁculties for college
ﬁrst-years, Barongan said.

One male student, who asked to
remain anonymous, said he was not
surprised by the report. His mental
health issues began in high school
when he was diagnosed with depres-
sion and anxiety. He went to coun-
seling regularly then, but he had
hoped when he went to college that
his problems would either go away
or diminish. He found that this was
deﬁnitely not the case and his expe-
rience with depression and anxiety
may have gotten worse here.

This student said that his biggest
issue at W&L is the social experi-
ence of attending class. He feels ex-
treme anxiety when assigned a mul-
titude of work and fears being called
upon in the middle of class if he is
not completely prepared. He has also
struggled with class attendance and
always exceeds the limit of allowed
skips.

This student has been able to ﬁnd
some help at W&L. He said that

‘thankfully most professors under-

stand if he speaks with them early
in the term about his depression and
anxiety. But he also said there have
been times when his grades would
have been higher if he’d been able to
attend more frequently.

His advice to other students with
similar issues is to be proactive in
talking with professors and keep in
constant contact. Most are complete-
ly understanding and non-judgmen-
tal, he said.

Another problem for students

_ struggling, with anxiety and depres-

sion is the stigma, the student said.

He said many men on this campus
assume that men should be tough
and not have depression or anxiety.
He said he wants to emphasize that
men deal with these issues as well as
women. ~

W&l students have many re-
sources to help them in their struggle
with mental pressures. Active Minds
is a new organization on campus
whose goal is to raise awareness
about depression and anxiety, among
other things. Both University and
Peer Counseling provide a safe en-
vironment for students to talk about
their concerns and get any help they
need.

Students raise awareness of mental health

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

In light of the recent Tucson,
Ariz., shootings, discussions about
mental health and the ways it is ad-
dressed have become more preva-
lent in Washington, in the news and
among members of the general pub-
lic.

Mental health agencies across the
country saw an increase in phone
calls and website traffic following
the shootings and the constant media
speculation about the mental health
of suspected gunman Jared Lee
Loughner. According to an article
recently published in The Chronicle
of Philanthropy, “traffic increased 15
percent last month over January 2010
on the National Alliance on Mental
lllness’s website and 18 percent on
Mental Health America’s, with many
visitors seeking out the ‘how to get
help’ sections.”

Members of the Washington and
Lee community began an effort last
year, before the shootings occurred,
to raise awareness about mental
health issues on campus‘. These ef-
forts culminated in the creation of
a campus chapter of an organiza-
tion called Active Minds. This is a
national nonproﬁt organization that
works to educate college students
about mental health issues and the
resources that are available to help
them with such struggles. Active

Minds boasts chapters at 300 college V

campuses across the country and
continues to grow and expand.
Lauren Ashley Tipton, a junior,
is the president of W&L’s chapter of
Active Minds, which currently has
about 18 members. But the relatively
small size of the group has not kept
its members from thinking big. Ac-
tive Minds plans to sponsor an Eating
Disorders Awareness Week on cam-

pus the week of Feb./28. Students all,

over the country will be participating
in various events in honor of Nation-
al Eating Disorders Awareness Week
from Feb. 20-26, but W&L students

will be on break during that time.

Tipton said that disordered eat-
ing is a “pretty prevalent issue on
campus,” which is why the members
of Active Minds thought it was im-
portant and worthwhile to organize a
week to promote discussion and un-
derstanding of it. ‘

While the details have not yet
been completely ﬁnalized, Active
Minds will be organizing several
different events during the week in-
cluding Operation Beautiful, a post-
it note campaign to end negative
self-talk, and a discussion led by a
panel of students who have struggled
with eating disorders and are now in
recovery.

Besides working on putting to-
gether events for Eating Disorders
Awareness Week, Active Minds has
also organized several conﬁdential
support groups on campus for stu-
dents who are struggling with vari-
ous issues. There is a group for dis-
ordered eating, a group for dealing
with symptoms of depression and a
group for dealing with grief.

Survey results recently published
in The Wall Street Journal show that

'nationally, only 52 percent of fresh-

men college students rated their men-
tal health as “above average or in the
highest 10 percent.” This number has
been decreasing since 1985 when 64
percent of freshmen students polled
believed that their mental health was
within this healthy range.

The survey also concluded that
mental health problems tend to affect
freshmen women more frequently
than their male counterparts. How-
ever, Tipton said that the issues ad-
dressed by Active Minds are not, by
any means, exclusive to girls.

Active Minds member Madison
McCune, a sophomore, said that
there are lots of people on cam-
pus struggling with these issues, so
students should not feel nervous or
self-conscious about asking for help.

Registration riles up student body   -

After having his own registration nightmare, Stockton Bullitt vents... and has some suggestions for the registrar

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

I don’t want to write an article about
the registration process.

Honestly, I had about ﬁfteen other
topics I would rather ramble on incoher-
ently about.

For instance, I really wanted to do
a light hearted article on the protests in
Cairo. Up until last Friday, the article
was practically writing itself.

The Egyptians took the riot against
the government routine to rioting’s
greatest heights since at least 1968 and
maybe even 1789. The looting done in
Cairo with all the military and police in
Tehrir Square put those done after Ka-
trina and Watt to absolute shame. And
let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a good
ole “let’s kick out the old, military re-
gime” routine. Yes We Can!

But, that’s around the time when
things got ugly, and jokes didn’t seem
appropriate. Mubarak’s supporters
pulled a classic LexPo move and barged
in, ruining the party way before it was
over. A Google executive went missing
for a while, and everyone in Lexing-
ton hoped that one of our own students
would make it out of the situation intact.
Thankfully, he did. .

I could’ve written about the fan-
tastically lame Super Bowl half time
show, which oﬁicially beat The Who
for worst performance ever. Strangely
enough, though, half the people I talked
to seemed to actually like it even though
Usher’s microphone didn’t work. But I
couldn’t write about that either.

See, every student at this school has
had at least one registration nightmare
story. Every single student here has bro-
ken something or threatened someone
because of the process of signing up for
classes.

‘Up until last Thursday, I’d never had
that nightmare situation. I would always
patronizingly tell the angered students
that they should’ve just paid more atten-
tion to the process and ‘read the emails
more carefully. I was pretty damn smug
sitting on my high horse.

That lasted until last Thursday
around 7:45 am. There was no high

horse, no patronizing voice, just lots of
swears and sarcastic remarks. If regis-
tration had been done with an XBOX
controller, I would’ve thrown it against
the wall and shattered it. I was furious
and had anyone with a patronizing tone
been in the vicinity, I might now be in
the building with barbed wire next to the
recycling center.

But, even that personal bad experi-
ence isn’t why I’m writing the stereo-
typical “screw registration” article.

I’m writing this article to protect
you, Registrar. I’m writing this because
I know you tried really hard to make this
as good a registration process as human-
ly possible. Hell, you tried harder than
Roethlisberger in a night club bathroom.
You overthrew the previous method and
really focused on improving your short-
comings. I see that, and I respect it.

That being said, last Thursday, I saw

I

mom using Facebook in the right way,
there have to be glaring issues with the
process. ‘

, So here are some tips for you, Regis-
trar. These aren’t for my beneﬁt because
I’m going to be a senior next year, and
you’ll be catering to me almost as much
as the alumni ofﬁce.

I do this for your own‘ safety. If
moms are incensed enough to use Face-
book correctly, then students will be
incensed enough to do something rash,
like complain to the Board of Trustees.
I don’t want that; you don’t either, so
try and get these issues straightened out
for your sake.

First and foremost, what is up with
the registration order?

Seniors make sense because they
need certain classes to be able to gradu-
ate, and for spring registration, about
half of them are signing up anyway, so

something that should scare you, the
Registrar, quite a bit.

On my News Feed on Facebook,
there was the usual string of “screw reg-
istration” status updates. Nothing new
here, but under one of the status updates,
a mom commented, “And as your parent
funding this, not so happy either!”

Registrar, I hope you are reading this
and understanding the magnitutde of

-this sentence. Moms don’t know how

to use Facebook in general, much less
how to comment on status updates. For
a mom to commit that kind of murder
on her son’s social life, she must be in-
censed. ,

you have no complaints there. That be-
ing said, ﬁrst-years were the worst sec-‘
ond pick since Hasheem Thabeet.

Look, rush is over. This is about the
time when ﬁrst years need to realize that
they are as relevant and meaningful as
the other two members of the Black-
Eyed Peas.

I mean, seriously, what is the freak-
ing point of giving ﬁrst-years a pick
above both the sophomores and juniors?
Obviously the kiddies will get into the
ﬁrst-year-only seminars because they
are the only ones allowed to take them
anyway.

By the end of their ﬁrst year, they’ve
had two full semesters to take “the in-
teresting class that you advertise to
parents to get their tuition money.” Let
them wait in line, like they are going to
have to do for the next two damn years.

And if you are using the fact that
freshmen have an early registration time
to try and attract potential students, you
aren’t smart enough to work at an aca-
demic institution. The kind of students
who are only attracted to beneﬁts for
freshmen aren’t capable of thinking in
the long term and therefore don’t have
the intellectual capacity to attend this
school.

Also, giving juniors the same reg-
istration time as the sophomores is a

Adieu, Andy Pettitte  

crime in its own right.

Don’t try and speak up, sophomores
because this is going to be your problem
in two months or so when registration
for Fall 2011 starts up. Juniors are now
worrying about getting internships and
will be worrying about getting jobs next
fall. They are the ones who need classes
they can show companies. So of course
it makes sense to put them last.

I wish I could listen to all the poten-
tial I-Bankers tell their Goldman Sachs
interviewers why they took “A Year in
Jazz: l957” instead of. .. well, anything
to do with I-Banking. Career Services,
shouldn’t this be a higher priority for
you? How is this not more important
that what color tie to wear to the inter-
view?

A second major problem with regis-
tration is its timing.

I realize that 7 a.m. is the only time
that everyone is free to have registra-
tion, and, you know what, if you re-
ally want to stick with that, you can.
However, if we students have to wake
up obnoxiously early (well, by college
standards) to register before going back
to bed, couldn’t you maybe be in the of-
ﬁce to help with troubleshooting?

I think this could be the biggest
problem with registration if it’s not
ﬁxed soon.

Most of the stories I have heard
about registration are individual case
problems. Someone’s correct password
was not recognized. Someone wasn’t
cleared for registration by the Business

'/ Oﬁice when he or she should’ve been.

Something is wrong with the server.
And so on. These are all fundamentally
unavoidable problems that can all be
ﬁxed with a call to the Registrar’s ofﬁce
and some simple ﬁxes.

However, when us students are do-
ing the registering and having these
problems at seven in the morning, the
Registrar is freaking closed.

Are you serious? What would hap-
pen to the Deans, campus security or
the Health Center if they decided they
didn’t feel like showing up to Tear
Night?

What happens to students who don’t
put in the extra couple of hours studying
for exams?

It is absolutely inexcusable for the
Registrar to not be open during prime
registration times. By the time the Reg-
istrar is open, most of the classes have
already been ﬁlled up and the negative
effects of having these little technical
glitches are exponentially ampliﬁed.

If the Registrar is set on having seven
in the morning be a registration time, I
think they can spend three or four early
mornings dedicated to helping students
with registration. Isn’t that their job?

Those were my main two issues
with the process. However, after asking
around campus for some other sugges-
tions, here are some other issues that
came up.

There seemed to be a ton of prob-
lems with having to see professors be-
forehand. First, I have heard numerous
stories of students having -to change
their entire schedule just to chase down
a professor to getpermission to take a
class the professor isn’t even currently
teaching.

Also, there are instances where the
professor has given permission to take
the class, yet there were still problems
registering. Why not have the profes-
sor approval period after registration? If
someone signs up for a class that they
cannot take, won’t this problem solve
itself after registration? It seemed like
the whole professor approval system
was a needless hurdle. _

There seemed to be an overabundance
of information with registration without
there being the simple method to regis-
ter that we used to have. Even though
we tend to be sweet when it comes to
book smarts, we W&L students are not
the brightest when it comes to street
smarts. So when you don’t have one
clear button to go and register for class-
es, many problems will arise. Likewise,
we are college students: we have much
better things to do than read numerous
registration-based emails. So when you
have three or four different emails that
are each a page in length, broadly de-
scribing the registration process, all the
details simply won’t be read and you
will have problems. This is the time for
everyone’s favorite: bullet points.

Finally, pay close attention to what
kinds of classes are ﬁlling up quickly
and which classes never get registered
for. Overall, the availability of solid
classes is getting better year by year,
but that doesn’t mean when I brought
this subject up to friends that lack of
quality classes wasn’t one of the top
complaints.

So, Registrar, please remember that
I don’t hate you, and in no way do I
blame you for repeatedly giving me ri-
diculously bad sign-uptimes for every
registration period, just like I’m sure the
entire student population doesn’t blame
you for giving them equally unfair reg-
istration times.

But I would very much appreciate
it if you seriously thought about these
suggestions. Not for my sake, but for
yours.

Patronizing enough?

Pat Smith recaps the brilliant career of the New York Yankee pitcher

By Pat Smith
5 TA F F w R I T E R

This past Friday was a‘ sad day for all
Yankee fans. The beloved Andy Pettitte
retired from the sport of baseball after
16 major league seasons.

He played all but three of his seasons
with the New York Yankees and boasts
extremely respectable career statistics.
His 240-138 (3.88 ERA) overall record
is one of the most impressive among all
starting pitchers, not to mention his 64
percent winning percentage.

As Pettitte enters into retirement,
his Hall of Fame status becomes a big
question.

Certainly, 240 wins is borderline.
But let’s face it, the 300-win club is

I no longer an attainable feat for starting

pitchers. j
His post-season success speaks for

itself(l9-10, 3.83 ERA). He also has 5

championship rings to show for it.

He would certainly get my vote into
the Hall of Fame, but of course, my
opinion is as relevant as players trying
in the NFL Pro Bowl.

As I have developed into a collegiate
pitcher, it was always great to study
some of the game’s great pitchers.

Being a lefty, watching Andy Pettitte
command the pitcher’s mound is noth-
ing short of impressive.

What set Andy Pettitte apart from
other lefties was his presence on th
mound. ‘

At all times he looked completely

calm and collected. He pounded the,

strike zone with pitches that move to
both sides of the plate and has managed
to fool hitters throughout his career by
changing speeds and getting hitters to
swing at bad pitches.

Probably the most impressive aspect
of Andy Pettitte’s game is his ability
hold a runner on base. No one attempts
to steal off of Andy because his pick-off
move is deadly. He mixes up his looks
and scares the living hell out of some
of the best base—stea1ers the MLB has
to offer.

Andy Pettitte is what experienced
baseball players like to call “a crafty
lefty.” He makes batters think to them-
selves, “How the hell did he just get me
out?”

He just does.

Well, not actually. It takes a lot of
hard work and a lot of fooling around
with different pitches. You don’t get to
the majors (let alone the New York Yan-
kees) without some effort.

This past season was one of Andy’s
best, despite it being cut short. He went
11-3 with a 3.28 ERA.

With the exception of Ubaldo Ji-
menez, Pettitte had one of the best starts
out of the gate to the 2010 season.

This past season I had the pleasure of
watching this lefty in the Bronx against

the Cleveland Indians.

Pettitte pitched a exceptionally crafty
lefty performance. Over the course of
seven innings he struck out ﬁve, walked
none and gave up only four hits.

Watching Andy rule the mound at I

this game was the opposite of watch-
ing the Black-Eyed Peas at the halftime
show.

Little did I know that this would be
the last time I would see him pitch in
person. I’m not crying right now, trust
me. .

Andy Pettitte, you will surely be
missed by many. Even though I feel like
you left me a season too early, you’re
still my favorite pitcher.

Now, if only Cliff Lee weren’t such
a cotton-headed—ninny-muggins (Elf
reference) and joined the Bronx Bomb-
ers, things might look a little better for
us in the rotation. At least we’re not as
bad as the Orioles pitching rotation.

On a completely random note: Does
anyone know why spring training is
very important? Because it gives the
Dominican players a chance to learn the
word, “renegotiate.” ‘

The day I dropped my sister off at
college was one of the saddest days of
my life.

I sobbed in front of Lee Chapel, half-
upset that she was leaving me and half-
jealous that she was going to college
when I was beginning the hardest year
of high school.

I cried the entire car ride home,
bawled during dinner, wept onimy walk
around the neighborhood, read through
teary eyes and cried myself to sleep. I
was about to live the next two years as
an only child.

Between tissues, a realization hit
me. My friends without siblings weren’t

ing if I wanted one. Awesome.

2. Every meal/shopping trip revolved
around me: Ifl was in the mood for In-
dian food, we would have Indian food.
If we were going out to dinner, the only
question was, where did I want to eat?

Shopping trips that used to revolve
around my sister now consisted of my
mom watching metry on racks of dress-
es and skirts and telling me how cute I
looked. I could get

4. If I wanted a weekend escape, I
had the option of visiting my sister at
college.

I may have taken advantage of this a
bit too often, considering that some of
her classmates mistook me for a trans-
fer student. ..

5. What does
mean?

Only children tend to have a harder

out of school or get pregnant, I was
good to go.

6. 1 always rode shotgun.

Whenever my sister and I went out
with one of our parents, we raced to the
car to determine who would be riding in
the front passenger’s seat.

I no longer had to worry about
this—I had no competition. Dancing to
“Telephone” with my mom in the front

When my sister and I were in high
school together, we put on either the
exact same outﬁt or the same colors al-

As an only child, I no longer had to
worry about either looking like a twin
or having to change two minutes before
leaving the house.

  ‘ Getting to know the White Panda  

The men behind the masks and mash-ups talk about their roots, the music business and their future career plans
By Valaree Tang and Diandra Spicak .

STAFF WRITER & MANAGING EDITOR

with Gabrielle Espy

STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER, WHITE PANDA ENTHUSIAST

Phi: How did you get started,

I how did you guys meet and how

did you get to where you are
now?

Evans: We met in second
grade, probably on the play-
ground or something, I don’t
know, it was a long time ago. We
got started with this current proj-
ect, let’s see... For me, you know,
it was just a hobby in college.
I’ve always been into music.
We’re both classically trained in
piano and we produced a rock
album in high school. I was a
fan of things like Girl Talk, so
you know... I just wanted to see
if I could do it and [it] turned out
[Griffith] was doing the exact
same thing.

Phi: How did you guys come
up with the name White Panda?

Evans: It was his [Grifﬁth’s]
idea. It was random. We were

‘ just brainstorming different types
* of things, shooting back things.

We thought it was catchy, and
everyone likes pandas, so...

Grifﬁth: We came up with
the name just because it was
catchy and we started sending
our music to bloggers and it
started picking up really quickly.
All of a sudden all of these fra-
ternities in colleges were kind
of like, “How much does it cost
to book you guys for shows?”
Tom and I were still in school,
so it was like “Whoah, we could
potentially go out and do some
shows? Let’s go out and build
our live show performances
around the name.” We’re called
White Panda, so let’s wear some
cool masks and get on stage and
go crazy. It’s kind of how we
evolved into what we are now.

Phi: What’s it like being
compared to other mash-up art-
ists like Girl Talk and Super
Mash Bros.? Is it a compliment?
Is it an insult?

Evans: I would say, at this
point, it’s sort of neither. Early
on, if someone mentioned us in
the same group as Girl Talk, it
was pretty cool. Because he’s
like an artist that you’re a big fan
of, and if. suddenly someone’s
putting you in the same catego-
ry, it feels pretty cool. I feel like
we’ve done enough at this point,
it’s obviously still cool to get re-

   
    
     
    
   
    
 

spect from people like that, but
that being said, We’re doing our
own tour now. Basically, Super
Mash Bros. are competition
for shows and we like to set
ourselves apart by doing more
energetic, visually crazier per-.
formances.

Phi: How are you crazier?

Evans: Running around
stage, jumping up and down,
getting on the mic a lot instead
of just standing around. We sort
of make an effort to differenti-
ate ourselves.

Griffith: We’re pandas!

Phi: What do you say to
people who say you’re not real
musical artists, because you’re
using other people’s work, and
[are] saying that you’re basi-
cally a “gloriﬁed DJ?”

Evans: In terms of the con-
tent of a release, I wouldn’t call
myself a musical artist. I think
that’s a fair point. I mean, we cer-
tainly have a musical ear. These
things just don’t put themselves
together. You can’t just take two
random songs, put them together,
and it just works. You’ve got to
ﬁnd songs with similar rhythms,
cadences and melodies, and just
stuff that ﬁts together that no one
else has tried before. And it’s not
that easy to do. We’re not com-
posing anything. I don’t think
that we ever try to assert that
we are. So, I.wouldn’t label us
musical artists. As far as glori-
ﬁed DJs, I would label us more
of producers than DJs, because
DJ s are out there spinning on the
vinyls and most of what we do
is done beforehand, producing
these tracks.

Phi: How did you come up
with the name “Procrast”?

Evans: This is actually a
question I don’t get very often.
Long before I ever expected this
to turn into anything, one of my
main means of procrastination
was making mash-ups, like, if
I didn’t want to study for inter-
views or midterms or whatever.
And I just thought, “Oh Procrast,
that’s cool.” I was actually going
to name my ﬁrst album “the Na-
tion,” so it would be “Procrast:
the Nation.” [laughs] I never
made that one public.

You guys are relatively
new to the scene. What’s it like
getting used to the fame and the
celebrity?

Evans: For the starters, when
the suits are on, We’re not really
that well-known. We don’t get
recognized in the street, which
is actually kind of nice. As far
as the shows themselves, you
know, it’s ﬂattering that people
know who you are and want to
meet you and take your picture
and get autographs and stuff. It’s
all relative, though. The parts
that are cool and shock us are
when something new happens.
The ﬁrst [time] I heard a track
of ours come on at a bar, now
that was cool. The ﬁrst time 1
actually did get recognized on
the street I was like “Oh wow,
that’s crazy.” Like, the ﬁrst time
someone sent us an email saying
that, “all my boyfriend wants
for Christmas is your autograph,
please sign one!” That was like
over a year ago, it’s like wow,
it’s pretty cool. So every time
something new happens it’s like,
wow, that’s pretty sweet. Our
friends also keep us down to
earth. Our friends don’t give a
shit about how famous we are.
Yeah, it’s Very humbling.

Phi: How do you make a liv-
ing if all of your music is free to
download online?

Grifﬁth:

You guys. You guys
bringing us in to play shows.
That’s huge revenue. The music
industry is so ﬁip-ﬂopped right
now, with piracy and how easy
it is to get music. Artists really
make their money off of doing
shows and tours.

Phi: Do you ever run into
any legal issues?

Grifﬁth: No. Imean, that’s
a question that mash-up DJ s run
into all the time. But what we do
is sample, heavily. But, no, that
really hasn’t been a problem be-
cause we’re not trying to get it
on to iTunes. Like you said, you
can easily grab our music and
download it for free. For that
reason, no one has really come
down on us, yet. In fact, a lot
of artists have complimented us
for a lot of the stuff that we do.
And actually, a mash-up that we
did a couple months ago, their
manager approached us and ba-
sically complimented us on the
song and asked us to do an of-
ﬁcial produced remix that we’re
working on now.

Phi: What is your ultimate
goal? Where do you see your-

selves in the future?

Evans: I see us sort of seg-

ing into

more production-heavy
music, like more of original pro-
ductions. Mash-ups. are great,
obviously. We love doing it and
we’re going to continue to do
it, but there’s sort of a ceiling.
You can’t headline Coachella as
a mash-up DJ. That’s obviously
an exaggeration, I don’t picture
myself headlining Coachella
any time soon. You know, with
the funding we have and the
time that we have, our knowl-
edge of these programs and the
equipment, [producing music] is
something to explore, because
with producing, really, the sky is
the limit.

Phi: Where have you been in
this last tour? And where are you
going next?

Grifﬁth: Well, it just got
started really. We were in Can-

ada last weekend, did a couple,

of shows in Ontario. Before
that, we were in North Carolina.
We’re in Oklahoma tomorrow
[Saturday, Feb. 5], in Dallas next
week. I think in the spring, like
between now and May, there’s
probably about 25 shows on the
books, and that could potentially
double.

Phi:
_Are you guys booked
for mostly college campuses?

Evans: Probably for the ma-  if

jority, yeah.

Phi: So, in ﬁve to 10 years,
where do you see yourselves?

Evans: That’s the money
question. I would love to see
us producing, but the music in-
dustry is pretty cutthroat. We’ve
made it in this one particular,
you know, niche, and if we try to
move out of it, we may or may
not be successful. It would be
awesome if we were, but if not,
we both have degrees from de-
cent universities.

&Lwins,thenfa|ls W&L swims to_  
impress inlnvlte

. Wrestling comes out strong in ﬁrst match, then falters

By Mike Decembrino
STAFF WRITER

Injuries proved to be a factor
yet again as the Washington and
Lee wrestling team split a pair
of matches in Allentown, Pa. on

' Saturday afternoon. The Gener-

als defeated the host Muhlen-
berg Mules 24-21 and then lost
to Ursinus College 43-6.

Junior Sam Campbell and
ﬁrst-year Dan Igel led the way
for the Generals as both record-
ed pins in the win over Muhlen-
berg. _The two wrestlers also re-
corded W&L‘s only wins in the
Ursinus match.

Assistant Coach Mike Ben-

_ nett believed the Generals had a

strong chance against Muhlen-
berg. Earlier this week he said,

_ “Muhlenberg has as many inju-

ries as we do, so if there’s any
shot at winning another match,
this one is it.”

This prediction held true as

1 Campbell’s pin ofMatt Parker at

I41 pounds along with Igel’s pin

, of Patrick Gibson at 165 pounds
; were the deciding factors. Both
' teams picked up a pair of forfeit

wins in the four matches not

i wrestled due to injuries. In fact,

the I25-pound weight class was

3 not even contested because both

teams had injuries.
Had Igel and Campbell not

won by pin, the Generals would

have lost the match because
Muhlenberg won three out of
the ﬁve matches wrestled. The
win over the Mules is W&L’s
ﬁrst Centennial Conference win
since the 2008-2009 season.

In the loss to Ursinus, inju-
ries dealt the Generals another
blow as Ursinus picked up ﬁve
forfeit wins. Andrew Corbett
sealed the deal for Ursinus with
a pin of W&L’s Brian Ross
at 165 pounds. Although Igel
moved up from I65 pounds to
174 pounds‘, he still managed to
pull out a 7-3 win against Wil-
liam Reick. Campbell‘s 3-2 win
over Elisha Gaylor came at the
I41-pound weight class.

Preparation during the week
has been difficult for the Gener-
als. Bennett said, “We‘ve lost
seven of our ten starters and
two-thirds of our roster to in-
jury. With only four or ﬁve guys
practicing daily, we are limited
in what we can do. Mental prep-
aration has been difﬁcult and the
intensity and energy in the prac-
tice room has taken a big hit."

Much of that intensity comes
from senior captain Keith J awor-
ski who has been sidelined with
an injury since Jan. 22. Despite
all these injuries, the Generals
continue to work hard in the
wrestling room. “We continue
to focus on being disciplined,
fundamentally sound wrestlers
that will step on the mat ready
for a ﬁght,” Bennett said.

The Centennial Conference

tournament will be held at W&L

Men compete individually in Virginia Tech Invitational

By Tyler Tokarczyk
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee
men’s swim team had their last
tune up before Bluegrass Moun-
tain Conference ﬁnals as they
travelled to Christiansburg this
weekend to take part in the Vir-
ginia Tech Invitational.

The -Invitational included
W&L, Virginia Tech, Georgia
Tech, UNC-Wilmington, James
Madison and VMI.

The t\vo-day meet included
stiff competition for the Gener-
als, swimming against ﬁve Divi-
sion I teams.

Junior Brian Sterling and
ﬁrst-year Justin Meyers were
the only two men to record a top
threeﬁnish on Saturday, the ﬁrst
day of competition. Sterling ﬁn-
ished second in the 100 ﬂy with
a time of 51.21. Meyers took
home third place in the 200 free
with a time of I :5l :45.

First-years Matt Hesser, and
Mark Faubion, and sophomore
Rick Sykes were the only other
Generals to advance to the ﬁ-
nals. All three placed ﬁfth in
their respective events: Hesser
in the I00 back, Faubion in the
100 breast and Sykes in the 50
ﬁ‘ee.'

You don't build a 200-year history of excellence in financial services

without learning a few things. Like how to recognize and celebrate
colleagues with exceptional qualities. And the importance of training and
developing them throughout their careers. We are proud to welcome the five
Washington and Lee students who will be joining us full-time this summer.
Congratulations to them on all their success.

The importance of this meet
was not necessarily to earn top-
place ﬁnishes, according to ﬁrst-
year Brendan McGoldrick, but
to take advantage of this last
opportunity to impress coaches
before conferences. “It was re-
ally a tune-up for the conference
meet and to help the coaches
make some decisions on who

will be on the conference scor-.

ing team,” he said.

Not all members of the team
will be able to be a part of the
scoring team at ‘conferences, so
for ﬁrst-years like McGoldrick,
it was their last opportunity to
prove to coaches they should be
on the roster.

Since the Generals were
treating the meet as a tune-up,
each swimmer only competed in
the one or two events they will
compete in at conferences. This
is so they can begin to build con-
ﬁdence in their best event and
ultimately perform their best at
conferences.

The team has also begun ta-
pering for conferences. All sea-
son long the team trains as hard
as possible to build up strength
and endurance. Once nearing

the end of the season they be-
gin to prepare for conferences
by tapering. Tapering involves
less "intense practices, ultimate-
ly ﬁnding a healthy medium
between resting the body and
maintaining the strength and
endurance they have worked all
season to obtain.

The Generals hope to have
a strong showing in a couple
weeks at the BGMC ﬁnals, Feb.
17 to 19.

Senior guard Allie Long (Hastings-
on-Hudson, N.Y./Hastings) rained threes
against the Hollins women’s basketball

team Tuesday night, leading Washington '

and Lee to an 82-50 victory over Hollins
in the Warner Center.

Following an easy win over Emory
& Henry on Saturday, the Generals kept
their intensity up for a huge win,

“We came into the game knowing we
needed to make a great team effort with
multiple people scoring and team defense.
I think we did both of these things,” said
Long. ’

The Generals (13-5, 9-4) began their
lead with a three-point shot by Kari Ann
Pfannenstein (Littleton, Colo./Heritage)
and did not relinquish for the rest of the
game. Their largest lead was by 41 points
in the second halfwith 8:33 left to go.
At the end of the game, W&L shot
a remarkable 42.9 percent, while Hollins
only shot 35.4.percent and allowed.2l

bests. Adkins and sophomore forward JD
Ey also chipped in seven points apiece.
Although they had a much better ef-
fort last Tuesday, the Generals also lost
that contest by a score of 68-60 to Ran-
dolph. The WildCats, who have also
received votes for the national top—25
rankings, jumped out to a quick 16-2 lead
from which W&L could not recover.
Randolph did their best to let the Gen-
erals back in the game by missing 13 free
throws and getting outrebounded 37-29,

turnovers. The Generals scored 28 total
points off of turnovers while their oppo-
nent only achieved 6.

Allie Long shot a stand-out of 21
points for the Generals, but was only one
of the four Generals who shot over 10
digits for the team. Junior Becca Bolton
(Pittsboro, N.C./Chatham Central) shot
an impressive 15 points, while junior
Pfannenstein added 11 shots-made to the
score and senior center Felice Herman
(Fairﬁeld, Pa./Delone Catholic) contrib-
uted l0 points.

Tamara Phillips (Roanoke, Va./Lord
Botetourt) was the top scorer in this
game for Hollins, contributing 12 points.
Jasmine Greene (Hampton, Va./Tabb),
the team’s overall top scorer was held
to four points, and Krystie White (Princ-
eton, WV/Princeton Senior) tacked on
six points, but the team was ultimately
unsuccessful in their conquest.

Remarking on their opponents play,

W&L rolls Hollins, 82-50

Strong defense coupled with accurate shooting gives Generals boost

Allie Long said, “we were able to shut
down their two main scorers defensively
which really helped us because Hollins
doesn’t play as well without those two
players leading the team.”

This is the women’s basketball team’s
14th consecutive win against Hollins
University, and was no let-down for the
Generals’ fans. Long said she thinks that
their win will keep their momentum up
for their next two games this weekend.

The team will return to action on Fri-
day at 7 pm at Roanoke College.

Students turned out in droves to com-
pete in last Sunday’s dodgeball tourna-
ment and to show their support for their
classmates, Natalie Stier and Kevin
Dyer. The event raised over $2000 each
for the Stier and Dyer family to help pay
medical bills that resulted from the car
accident in December.

Before the teams hit the court to
unleash their completive spirit, Doug
Bealle and Sarah Monte, the event or-
ganizers, presented Dyer and Stier with
ceremonial super-sized $2000 checks.
But with t-shirt sales and donations yet
to be ﬁnalized, they said the ﬁnal amount
would deﬁnitely be higher.

Sixteen teams entered the competi-
tion, but only one could win could win
the tournament and Fancy Dress tickets
for the entire squad. The rounds in-

Wells appointed to Executive Commi

volved some impressive evasive maneu-
vers and more than a few painful look-
ing smacks of ball hitting skin.

if the ofﬁcials decided a match was
running too long, they would abolish
the boundary lines, allowing a mad dash
free-for-all as the remaining players
chased each other down.

Both Stier’s track and ﬁeld team-
mates and Dyer’s Phi Kappa Sigma
brothers battled their way through the
bracket to the ﬁnal match, and after a
close championship game, the track run-
ners ﬁnished ﬁrst.

Marissa Thompson, who helped or-
ganize the track team, said it was a great
bonding experience for a team that has
been missing its captain since the De-
cember accident.

After the accident, which involved

ﬁve Washington and Lee students, both
Stier and Dyer were in critical condi-
tion. They each remained in the hospital
for over a month.

But both have made stunning prog-
ress and they continue to improve with
physical therapy. Stier is expected to
make a full recovery.

Although Dyer is currently conﬁned
to a wheelchair, his outlook on life re-
mains resiliently positive.

“Since my accident, I have come to
realize that it is true that 10% of life is
what happens to you, and 90% is how
you deal with it,” reads one of his jour-
nal entries on Caringbridge.com, a site
that connects patients to their friends
and family.

The W&L community also needed to
recover after the accident. Bealle said

STUDENTS AND FOR THE STUDENTS SINCE 1897

the idea for the tournament came to him
over winter break because so many peo-
ple were asking how they could help.

He said the event was as much about
helping out the Dyer and Stier families
as it was about the student body coming
together to support their injured friends.
He called the event a “cathartic experi-
ence,” and said he thanks everyone for
the outpouring of support.

When Bealle told Monte about the
idea, she said she thought it would be
a great way to help both Dyer and Sti-
er, who she said is one of her closest
friends.

Monte, Bealle and other volunteers I

went door to door in downtown Lexing-
ton asking for donations for the raffle.
They designed t-shirts, reserved the
gym and even overcame a few problems

W&L students team up to support their injured classmates

with the swipe machines.

“l’m really proud of the student
body,” said Monte after the tournament.

Stier said she was also very excited
about the number of students that par-
ticipated. “The turnout was awesome,
more than I expected,” she said.

Overall, Stier said, the tournament
was a lot of fun and that dodgeball was
a good choice because it’s a sport every-
one can play.

Stier had one other reason to smile
after the tournament. ‘‘I’m very happy
the track team won,” Stier said.

After an intensive nomination and interview process, EC appoints new junior representative to ﬁll vacant spot

By Eleanor Kennedy
NEWS EDITOR

John Wells, a junior from Columbia,
S.C., is the newest member of Washing-
ton and Lee’s Executive Committee.

Wells was appointed to the EC to
replace junior Luke Anderson, who
resigned last Tuesday for personal rea-
sons. '

When a member steps down, the Stu-
dent Body Constitution requires the EC
to ﬁll the vacancy, but does not specify
how a new member should be selected.

Although special elections have been
held in the past, the EC decided not to
do so this time.

President Scott Centorino said that
since regular elections are only a month
and a half away, the EC felt “that to ap-
point someone would be the best thing
for the class.” ‘

Centorino asked all members of the
EC to nominate juniors whom they felt
could best represent their peers. About
30 names were suggested at ﬁrst, and
that list was eventually pared down to
six.
The EC tried to be as thorough as
possible in its selection of potential
members. “We didn’t want to leave any
stone unturned,” Centorino said. '

The six nominees were invited to
interview for the position last Sunday.
One student chose not to participate
because of other commitments. The EC
conducted 25 minute interviews with
the rest of nominees in order to make
their selection.

Centorino said subjects _covered
ranged from the honor system, to the

candidate’s personal temperament to
other activities they were involved in.
Every current member was allowed to
ask questions, and Centorino said that
made for some very interesting inter-
views. L

“Everybody on the EC is looking for
something different,” Centorino said,
“but we all want the best representa-
tive.”

One area which the EC paid special
attention to was nominees’ experience
in other governing bodies. Because the
new member must immediately begin
representing his peers and ruling on
EC business, current members wanted
someone who would be prepared to take
on that level of responsibility.

Centorino said that choosing the new

member was one of the most difﬁcult
decisions he has made in his time on the
EC.

“Once we got to theinterviews, it
was clear we were going to get a great
new member,” Centorino said.

That new member is Wells, a biology
major who currently serves as treasurer
of the IFC. .

Centorino said Wells was selected
because members believe that he can
represent his class effectively while still
keeping an open mind to others’ points
of view.

“His abilities are unquestionable,"
Centorino said. “Nobody had anything
bad to say about the guy.”

Wells said. he feels honored that he
was even considered for the position.

Although he has not beeninvolved with
student government before, he said he
thinks his time on IFC will give him a
strong perspective on Greek life and stu-
dent government.

Wells said he is not sure whether he
will run for EC in the upcoming elec-
tions, but he sees this time as a great
opportunity to see if he would like to
continue representing his class.

1‘:

“I look forward to representing the A

class of 2012,” Wells said. “l'hope peo-
ple will feel comfortable coming to me
if they have any questions about the EC
or about me.”

“The most polite, well-mannered,and
charming people I have ever met have
come from Washington and Lee," said
author, speechwriter, presidential advi-
sor, professor, actor and economist Ben
Stein.

Last Tuesday, Stein visited W&L as a
result ofpersistent efforts by the student-
run Contact Committee. Depending on
how you look at the Columbia under-
graduate and Yale Law School gradu-
ate, Stein is mostly known for his role
in the 1986 classic Ferris Bue/[er Is Day
Oﬂ, his Comedy Central show Win Ben
Stein 3 Money, and his role as a speech-
writer to Presidents Richard ‘Nixon and
subsequently Gerald Ford. But after lis-
tening to Stein’s lecture in Lee Chapel,
W&L community members will surely
remember Stein differently.

Stein began his lecture by telling
three brief anecdotes. Before the stories,

he said, “I have to tell you some sto-
ries, or else it’s not me!”

But after the stories, Stein spent
the rest of his lecture expressing an
intense sense of gratitude for every-
thing that our country has~from his
wife to our armed forces.

“I thank God every day for wak-
ing up with my wife,” Stein said.
“Getting married to the right person
is the biggest step you take in life

and ﬁnding the right life partner is V

the most challenoin step in life.”
D A
Stein referred to his wife as
a “literal saint” numerous times

throughout his lecture. Despite all I

he has accomplished and succeeded
in throughout his life, Stein said his
family has been the most impor-
tant,‘ along with those who serve
for our country. Stein said everyone
should be grateful for our military,

our nurses and doctors, our teachers
and professors, and for our military
wives.

Stein also said that he is not con-
cerned with recent challenges that
America may face with the increas-
ing economic stability of China.

“America has always been a great
country,” said Stein. “China is four
and half times the size of the United
States. It doesn’t bother me if we
don’t stay as the world’s most indus-
trial power.”

What worries Stein the most
about China’s increasing stability is
the education system in the United
States. Stein said he is concerned that
at other universities and especially at
high schools, most students cannot
handle basic-level work. According
to Stein, many college sophomores
know less about history and English

 

than theydid in high school.

“If people don’t know history or
basic things, how will they know to be
grateful for good in America?” asked
Stein. “How will they know how much
to sacriﬁce to keep America as [glori-
ous] as it is?”

When asked by an audience mem-
ber, Stein said that he has sacriﬁced
very few things, if any, throughout his

life. He thoroughly enjoys sharing his_

accomplishments and experiences with
other educated individuals throughout
the world. I

Stein will always have the utmost re-
spect for W&L. After all, he did say, “I
love, love, love Washington and Lee.”

THE RING-TUM PHI '3

 

opinions

‘ Enjoy

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

I’d like to thank Hallmark.
No, not for their channel. When
your programming makes Oxy-
gen seem masculine, WE seem
tolerable and Lifetime seem not
that melodramatic, you know
that you have the worst channel
since My9.

I’m not even a big fanof the
cards either. The Hallmark aisle
in CVS is probably the second
worst aisle in the whole store.
The worst, of course, is the femi-
nine hygiene aisle. That aisle is a
trail of tears in its own right.

But I digress: I want to thank
Hallmark for an action that has
gotten a good amount of ridicule
over the last few years: turning
Valentine’s Day into the con-
glomerated nightmare it is to-
day. I have heard many protests
against the company claiming
h'ow evil Valentine’s Day has be-
come.

I mean, the holiday origi-
nally was about an early Chris-
tian martyr who was not even
a big Cupid fan himself. How
could Hallmark turn such a holy
holiday into a movie that starred
Taylor Lautner and Taylor Swift
among other horrible actors?

After doing a little bit of light
research on the subject (see:
MLA’s favorite Wikipedia), I
found out that Hallmark wasn’t
even started as a company until
the.modem view of Valentine’s
was established. Nevertheless,
they still receive others’ blame
and my praise.

See, I want to thank Hallmark
for their piece in the destruction
of American society because I ac-
tually like the modern Valentine’s
Day. The cultural phenomenon it
has developed into has been an
annual adventure for me.

After numerous failures and
successes, I think I can now say
that I have conquered Valentine’s
Day, and as a true connoisseur
of the subject, I will do my best
to defend it and advise others on
how to conquer it.

The most common case made
against the modern Valentine’s
Day is its superﬁciality. As
America seems to get more and
more focused on surface appear-
ance as a result of its heavy re-
liance on the service industry,
Americans seem threatened by
the lack of depth that the upcom-
ing youth perceive in others.

They argue that because we
no longer rely on making things
as a country, the value of what
someone does is no longer as
important as what others think
he can do or what he looks like.
Also, with an economy of excess
wealth, we have more money to
spend on these unnecessary fri-
volities that heighten our surface
appearance without us having to
better our spirit or intellectual
determination. Valentine’s Day,
these others argue, is the epitome
of this problem. We buy pieces
folded pieces of paper, terrible
tasting candies with no nutrition-
al value, buy cotton stuffed fake
animals and purchase millions of
dollars worth of shiny things for
no real reason other than satisfy-
ing our temporary wants or bet-
ting the surface appearance of
those we are close to.

While these other people
might have somewhat of a point
(mostly because I made up their
argument), why does America’s
superﬁciality seem like a new
thing and why is Valentine’s
Day seeming embrace of excess
wealth and surface appearance
so bad in its own right?

Let’s not kid ourselves;
America has been superﬁcial
since about day one. Unfortu-
nately though, back in the days —
before Valentine’s Day, it was
just called racism and it was a
much less dapper form of super-
ﬁciality. Nowadays, superﬁcial-
ity just hurts people’s feelings.
Back then, it hurt their backs. I
say we made progress.

Furthermore, if we’re go-
ing to bunch the entire country
and compare it to other coun-
tries, then it’s probably safe to
say that we do have a little too
much excess wealth. So, what’s
so bad about using that wealth to

ing Valentine’s Day at W&L@

buy stuff that makes us happy? I
know that about 100 economics
majors just scoffed loudly (I’m
looking at you, freshman room-
mate), but it’s not like we’re
investing our money into smart
decisions anyway, so why not
gratify ourselves? Every civiliza-
tion has their certain things that
they spend capital on to make
themselves look pretty, so why
should we be any different?

Okay, I even bored myself
with all that mumbo-jumbo. I
know that you just want to get
to my lead—in about fraternities.
We’re getting there. Be patient.

So, now that we know Valen-
tine’s Day isn’t evil, what’s so
good about it?

Well, there are two answers
to that question, depending on
whether or not you have a Y
chromosome.

If you do, that means you are a
male, and you have a really hard
time seeing how Valentine’s Day
is anything other than a drain on
your wallet. Look, guys, by not
embracing Valentine’s Day you
are doing terrible things to your
reproductive organs. Don’t view
Valentine’s Day as a burden, but
rather as an opportunity. For 364
days out of the year, you have to
earn affection by spending time
with girls, pretending to pay at-
tention to their problems and
getting involved in drama. How-
ever, Hallmark and a little known
martyr have given you a valuable
gift: the ability for one night to
simply purchase affection.

Okay, KEWL, chill out, I’m
not that shallow. Well, maybe
a little, but that’s not the point
I’m trying to make. See, the pur-
chased affection does not neces-
sarily need to come in the form of
money. By putting in a little time
and effort, you V eally get far
with va1en;m'é‘*§‘b ‘ “

 
 

there also get you far with
Valegitiije’s Day, so don’t neces-
sarily discount that.

What5gI’m really trying to say
is that,ﬁVaIer1tine’s Day is the day
of the year when you literally get
the best/"bang=;~..for your buck. In
that respecll‘,-dtjtii‘-narrowly edges
out Tear Night"-fo'r.—i.tl'ie..‘night of
the year when  ‘results
in high dividends in theisédidom.
For you Econ majors, theiiiagvj
opportunity cost lets you break?
down those barriers to entry cre-
ating a night of high utility.

Plus, this year, Valentine’s
Day is on a Monday. C’mon,
have you ever tried to hook up on
a Monday without chocolate or a
teddy bear to back you up? It’s
hard. Girls here are usually hav-
ing a bad case of the Mondays
and are more focused on the TV
lineup for ABC Family than on
making some bad decisions. This
is the only real opportunity you
have for a quality Monday. hook-
up the entire year and all it costs
is a dinner at the Red Hen or a
thoughtfully put together “Roses
are Red” poem. Is that really so
difﬁcult?

And for you single guys with
seemingly no one to turn to on
Valentine’s Day, this is the only
day of the year when you can
make an ass out of yourself and
actually, maybe get positive re-
sults. If you tell a girl way hotter
than you that you have loved her
for the last six months at KA’s
Resurrection party, you will
probably be greeted with a nice
little restraining order or an SJC
hearing. But if you confess that
same love to the same girl on
Valentine’s Day and accompany
it with a cute song or poem and
a glass of champagne, there’s a
chance that you might actually
get lucky. In other words, Valen-
tine’s Day is the only day where
“Eww, creepy” becomes “Aww,
cute.”

Now for the ladies, I know
that you all probably love Valen-
tine’s Day, so I don’t need to do
that much convincing. However,
there are some single ones out
there who sadly will be without a
pursuer this Valentine’s Day, and
I’m guessing that this article is
making you reach for that box of
chocolates extra fast.

_ y':“weii.; also ~ 
putting little money here ait'tl'—

 

However, even for you guys,
there is an upside to Valentine’s
Day. You have a no holds barred
excuse to throw your very own
pity party for an entire day. No
self respecting ‘girl is going to
quell the complaints of the girl
who wasn’t sent ﬂowers on Val-
entine’s Day because every girl
isjust as afraid that that might be
her next year. Normally, buying
yourself ﬂowers, teddy bears and
boatloads of chocolate would be
enough for you-r friends to have
a little intervention about the re-
lationshipbetween you and your
sanity. However, it’s Valentine’s
Day, the only day when watching
“He’s Just Not That Into You”
seven times isn’t a committable
offense!

And for you girls in relation-
ships at Washington and Lee, be
warned. Make sure you know
what you are getting into when
you celebrate Valentine’s Day
with your W&L date. Each fra-
ternity has developed their men
in very speciﬁc ways, meaning
that each fraternity will give
you a unique experience when
it comes to your Valentine’s Day
date.

Now, if your date is a GDI or
an Independent if you will, there
are a whole slew of problems
you might confront. Mostly like-
ly, your Independent date is too
busy to take you out to dinner be-
cause he’s too busy in the library,
in the church or in his own room
being lame and playing video
games. Either that, or he’s bak-
ing you such a fantastic meal and
treating you so exquisitely that
you have no   est
of this ami_<;il§', 6 let’sjust_fdr’”",

 

big brother didn’t agree with me.
Let’s be honest, if an SAE is tak-
ing you out on a Valentine’s Day
date, you are probably a Kappa.
And because you are a Kappa,
you will need to rush to dinner.
You and your date are probably
not that famous of lovers, but
I’m sure ifyou rush to dinner fast
enough, you’ll get there in ﬁve or
six snaps. Still, your shrimp and
grits dinner will be delightful,
or maybe it was steak and grits.
Who knows? The details with
what happens with SAEs at night
are always so questionable.

Kappa Alpha - Don’t try
and wiggle your way out of it,
your KA date is taking you to a
buffet for Valentine’s Day. Yeah,
he will give you tons of presents
throughout your date, so you will
be plenty entertained, but most
likely they will all come from
Walmart. As you’re explaining to
your date that bigger does not al-
ways mean better, he will notice
some ofhis pledges eating dinner
at the table next to him. You will
see his face getting red as the
pledges obviously are not study-
ing as they should be. But have
no fear, because soon the anger
will subside when he realizes
that those are just KA’s “B” team
pledges, and as you leave, he’ll
wish them luck in the Kappa Sig
house next year.

Sigma Chi — Your Sigma
Chi date will pick you up early
for your wonderful night on the
town. You will think to yourself
that Niko’s probably isn’t the
most romantic place to ‘spend a
Valentine’s Day, but he’s a little

about _Ip§iependents and"‘their‘3§s;;broke from rush. That won’t

dates folifnow. I’m just goingto

focus  the fraternities and their,‘ g H
‘a, member of the Big 3. As he’s

respeétive dates for now.

 " fﬁliis is whatto expect from

lily  «date from each frater-
nity,;_and it is organized in the
most"logical way 1 could think
of: by the latest rankings in the
comment section of the W&L
fraternity section of the site
GreekRank.com. I’m guessing

these rankings were done using

a complicated statistical formula
based on community service and
GPA, so I’m going to trust that

      

 

3:‘

Phi Delta  (‘U ike
many of the subseqiientif ater-
nities on this list, you carfmeet
your Phi Delt at his house before
going out to dinner. Yeah, he
might wear a suit and tie out to
the Bistro, but you can bet that
the tie will be loosened and the
shirt unbuttoned. Make sure that
you have candles at your table
because I’m guessing that it’s
been a while since his last show-
er. After dinner, he’ll probably
take you out partying. So, either
you’ll end up in the basement
having a Helen Keller themed
party so security doesn’t hear,
or some freshmen from a sweet
Southern prep school will pick
you and take you ﬁfteen minutes
out to a party. Your cell phone is
not needed because there’s no
service.

Phi Kappa sigma — Unless
you want to meet him at Woods
Creek, you will be picked up in
(at worst) a 5 series BMW be-
cause lax bros simply don’t put
up with Lexus. Before getting in
the car, make sure you move his
mirror into the backseat. I know
you probably wanted a group date
with some friends, but Phi Kaps
are no longer Congregationalists.
Luckily, you will not even have
to reach for the check because
he’ll be signing the bill “Trust
- Fund.” After dinner, you’ll get
your group date with the armada
developing outside County Seat,
but I don’t think you’ll love the
atmosphere: they’re all too nosy.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon
— Well, I was going to give you
certain advice about going out on
a date with SAE, but the school
overrode my decision because

‘iiétgop him from picking you up
i111‘f;a limo for your night with a

merftioning to you how nice be-
ling? inthe Big 3 is, he’ll pour
‘.yoi1 some champagne. However,
Qthig I ink champagne tastes less
_-ililie  ose and more like Volt and

5 efcépt for the moment when he

.7’ r§a¥l‘izes that your table only re-
° tiejved eight rolls. Just put your

 down when he goes from
gitgble to table asking if anyone
 as any extra rolls,'but at least all

‘ lg‘; of his friends join the date after-
~ they are accurate‘ and whollyyfepsfﬂiii wards to giggle with each other
‘eaaegent fraternities at this schoogg’

i

and chat about how the night’s
going. You might wonder where
their dates are though.

Pi Kappa Phi —Your dinner
will be average with your date Pi
Phi Joe, but he’ll constantly be
lamenting the fact that he’s get-
ting shut down by Globo Gym.
The night will be pretty nonde-
script for the most part. Yeah,
you’ll get chocolates, but they
will be your run of the mill Rus-
sell Stover’s. He"ll almost get
you the teddy bear that you really
wanted for Valentine’s Day, but
he won’t. Finally, after having a
pretty good night spent mostly
in shaded areas, you will head
home to whoops from his pledge
brothers. That is, until you step
into the light...

Phi Kappa Psi — Speaking
of face issues, if you are the type
of girl-who likes giving her date
useful gifts for Valentine’s Day,
why not give the gift that keeps
on giving? Proactiv. You will
not ﬁnd a date who tries harder
to impress you than a Phi Psi
on Valentine’s Day. He will pull
out all the stops, just for you.
So what if the dinner is ined-
ible and whatever-that-thing-is
that he made you himself as a
gift will soon makes its way into
the dumpster, who are you to
take away that adorable shit eat-
ing grin? Just make sure that his
busy schedule doesn’t get in the
way of your date; it would be a
major downer if he skipped an-
other date to attend KA’s'class on
social climbing.

Beta Theta Pi — You are
going to have to remind your
Beta date that it is, in fact, Val-
entine’s Day, and that means he
does, in fact, have to take you
out on a date or at least buy you J

something. Finally realizing that
you’re serious, he’ll put on his
Monday best: an NBA jersey
that shows off his...well...are
those muscles? He’ll take you to
his version of a fancy restaurant:
Taco Bell, where you’ll probably
have to pay because he “forgot
his wallet at home.” Better use
the drive-thru though, because
if you eat inside, he’ll ﬁnd some
random dude looking at you the
wrong way and haymaker him

_ for no reason whatsoever. As

he’s kicking the guy while he’s
down, you’ll leave quietly. Later
on that night, he’ll either text you
numerous times or just call you
and mumble incoherently as he
attempts for a Hail Mary booty
call.

Lambda chi Alpha — You
are going to spend most of your
time trying to ﬁnd an amply
fancy enough dress for dinner. If
you assume that he will be wear-
ing anything other than interview
attire, you will be overshadowed
in dressiness on Valentine’s Day
and guys should never be the
center of attention today. This is
your day, but since no Lambda
owns a t-shirt, he won’t get that
memo. You’ll have to pick up
your date at the freshmen dorms
because he’ll be busy advising
his resident freshmen boys --
well, the ones that are still there
on a Monday evening in Febru-
ary. The most important thing to
remember is to never mention the
fact that you voted for Obama in
2008 or like any government in-
tervention whatsoever, because
if you do, he probably won’t pay
for the check.

Phi Gamma Delta — Do
not, I repeat, do not try and pick
your Fiji date up at his house.
GPS can’t even ﬁnd that house.
Also be sure to ask refrain from
replying, “No really what fra-
ternity did you pledge?” when
he tells you how great Fiji is. I
assure you that people are mem-
bers there.,Speaking of, if you
are tired of the small school
atmosphere and feel like meet-
ing l7 people who go to school
with you who I’m sure you have
never met, try hanging out with
the Fiji pledge class before going
on your date. They’re a blast. I’m
sure you’ll get adequate gifts and
have a ﬁne dinner with your Fiji,
date, but make sure you remem-
ber his name or the whole night
will be for naught.

Pi Kappa Alpha — Expect
vast bouquets of ﬂowers from
your PiKA date. In fact, expect
a fruitful accompaniment to your
vast bouquets of ﬂowers. You
will lose track oftime over dinner
because you and your date will
be chatting for such an extended
period of time that you will not
know what happened to your din-
ner. How can he be so focused on
the conversation at hand and yet
talk so fast and excitedly for the
three to ﬁve hours you will hang
out for the night? No idea; he
must just be a tangential thinker.
He will graciously pay for the
bill even though he didn’t even
touch his salad. However, the
night will end up on somewhat
of a sour note when you reach
for his endowment, and he looks
at his watch and exclaims, “Look
at the time! I have so much work
to ﬁnish”

Chi Psi — After dinner, your
date will take you back to the Chi
Psi house for an after dinner ren-
dezvous. You will be thoroughly
surprised to discover something
you haven’t seen since Roeth1is-
berger held the Lombardi Tro-
phy: freshmen running around
the house. After you wipe your

‘eyes in disbelief, you will start

heading upstairs with your date
when one of these mysterious
freshman will ﬁnally speak up.
Yeah, it’ll be a little bit ofa tum-
off when your date has to fetch
the freshman water and then do
pushups for not doing it with a
smile, but, hey, who are you to
complain? After you get upstairs,
be careful not to make out with

your date too «loudly or a kid
down the hall will call security
on you for distracting his study-
ing. Good news for you though:
if you actually do spend the late
night at Chi Psi, hanging out up-
stairs at that hour will end the
same way as hanging out in their
basement at the hour. . .with your
pants off.

Sigma Phi Epsilon - Try to
wear ear plugs on the drive over
to dinner, because your Sig Ep
date will probably be playing his
new CD in the car. If you don’t
bring the ear plugs, make sure
you zone out, and if he asks, say
his music sounds edgy and “kind
of like a revolution of your ears,”
and he’ll be appeased enough to
pay for the check. If you want
gifts to go with the check how-
ever, you’ll probably have to do
a little more appeasing during
dinner. Just keep nodding and
smiling whenever he tells you,
“No seriously, we’re getting cool
now. Have you seen our pledge
class? Have you been to our par-
ties? They are legit now. We’re
getting hot girls here all the time,
especially freshman bitties.” Try
and avoid adding sarcastic u’s
to your “Sure,” or you won’t be
getting the earrings he got from
Jared.

Kappa Sigma — Look, I
don’t know anything about Kap-
pa Sig. You don’t know anything
about Kappa Sig. And even if we
did know anything about,Kappa
Sig, I have a feeling that they are
more random than Lady Gaga
arriving inside of an egg at the
Grammy’s. Therefore, I’m go-
ing to talk about something else:
C0llegeACB. After traveling to
the site for the ﬁrst time in a year,
let me tell you how hilariously
awful this site has become. Not
only do people still say phrases
like “when was the last time any
respectable big 3 guy attended
a KA party? NEVER” (I must
be hanging out with the wrong
people if there are people who
actually think like that), but there
are other students who somehow
only seem to ﬁnd enjoyment in
going past the school’s encryp-
tion to a blocked website just
to question the validity of the
statements made on that site.
Really? You’re going to change
someone’s degrading comment
by going onto a blocked website
and patronizingly waxing po-
etic about how you shouldn’t be
mean on an anonymous site that’s
designed for people to say mean
things? Two questions: how did
you get into this school and have
you ever tried not reading these
postings? One last thing: I rarely
like to give the administration
credit, but you have to admit they
did a pretty good job with the
whole “Jdicy Campus” situation.
It was a legitimate problem two
years ago, and now that problem
is damn near close to extinction
at W&L. You really can’t say
that their initiatives weren’t as
successful as they could possibly
be in that respect. Parents, make
sure you read that last sentence,
and administration, I will now
gladly accept my get out of jail
free card now.

Sigma Nu — Hopefully on
Tuesday, there isn’t a math or
science test. If so, you will ba-
sically have the same problems
dating a Sigma Nu on Valentine’s
Day as you do dating an indepen-
dent on Valentine’s Day (not that
you don’t without the test). Your
dinner will be fantastic... as long
as you know Elvish. That’s re-
ally where the Sigma Nu knows
his best love poetry. Don’t be
worried on the walk over to the
Bistro: just because he’s follow-
ing you at a distance of 100 feet,
doesn’t mean he doesn’t like you.
That’sjust his MO. Unlike going
on a date with a Phi Delt, you are
deﬁnitely going to need your cell
phone with your date with a SNu.
If you need a ride home the next
day, you can’t borrow his phone
to call a friend: he used all his
minutes calling the cops on par-
ties and snowball ﬁghts.

Protecting the Chesapeake Bay

Doing your part to help protect the Chesapeake Bay Watershed is imperative in preserving the area 3 natural beauty

By Jackson Buttery
C 0 L U M N IS I

To the Students, Faculty, and
Members of the Washington and
Lee University Community:

There exists neither a simple
nor singular way to save the en-
vironment.

Neither Superman nor Cap-
tain Planet will appear from the
clouds; no solution no matter
how brilliant will eradicate the
unfathomable amounts of waste
from the surface of the earth; no
magic chemical will erase the
stains of human pollution.

While saving the environ-
ment is the ultimate and most
important goal, it is also terribly
impractical. The environment is
and isn’t the world around us.
I can best deﬁne it as a series
of interconnected, various and
unique natural systems whose
roots ,can each be traced deeply
and speciﬁcally. The most prac-
tical goal, then, is to save our
environment and hope and con-
vince others to save theirs.

Our school, Washington and
Lee University, belongs to one
of the most important and largest
bio-regions in the United States,
the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.

As Ned Tillman, the author
of The Chesapeake Watershed
writes:

“The Chesapeake Bay Wa-
tershed is large and diverse, col-
lecting waters that fall on parts of
six states. Rain falling on farms,
factories, and probably even on
your house,,lawn, and driveway
ﬂows along countless streams
and rivers that crisscross the
land and eventually mixes with
the saltier waters of the bay. The
water quality, biodiversity, and
health of the bay and its ﬁsher-
ies are all related to every part of

the habitat throughout this vast,
ﬁfty-million acre watershed. We
are all in this together” (91).

While many daunting issues
face the bay — including pollu-
tion, the rising level of sea water
and the declines of the popula-
tions of many native species, to
name a few — perhaps the big-
gest problem the bay must deal
with is its own reputation.

While I can not speak for the
rest of the country, for years the
only environmental rally cries I
heard (besides SAVE THE PO-
LAR BEARS! and SAVE THE
AMAZON!) were SAVE THE
BAY! and THE BAY IS DY-
ING!

As hard as it was to not hear
about the dying bay, it was just
as easy to believe that the en-
vironmentalists — who I then
imagined as scraggly ex-hippies
munching granola in some sort
ofenvironmental VW bus — were
already handling the issue.

The bay wasn’t my prob-
lem because I live in northeast
Philadelphia, far away from the
the Chesapeake Bay. My fam-
ily doesn’t even recycle. Most
nights we eat from cheap paper
plates. The Bay was at least a
couple of hours away and I had
only been there once, a long
time ago.

My brother says we went in
the water and crabbed with met-
al cages and raw chicken necks,
but all I can remember is eating
crabcakes sitting in a mostly-
wooden restaurant that was little
more than a shack.

I still haven’t been back and
the bay, for me, is a region I am
very unfamiliar with and a natu-
ral beauty that I truthfully can
not picture in my mind.

THE MEDIA BOARD

I can read books about it and
look at pictures and try to put
the pieces together but I still can
not grasp it completely. It is not
mine.

While I am not as well ac-
quainted with the landscape of
our university as well as I am
with the city grid of Philadelphia
or the trails of Pennypack Park,
I have gained a deep apprecia-
tion for the wonder this region
holds.

Upon first driving down
Interstate 81, the green roll-
ing hills and lush grass and the
mountains shading the sky in
the background brought vivid
memories ofthe summer before,
of a train ride through the tran-
quil Austrian countryside, from
Munich to Salzburg, with the
similar framing and colors ofthe
Shenandoah Valley.

There is something unde-
niably special about this area.
Maybe it’s the way the sun sets
over the Blue Ridge Mountains,
or the red brick paired with the
snow lying fresh on the ground,
or the bike trail along Woods
Creek in late fall when no one
else is around and the crisp air
cuts into your lungs but you feel
alive.

I traded skyscrapers, row-
homes and subways for Traveler
and the Colonnade and the bones
of Robert Edward Lee, and this
place is my homejust as well as
yours.

To preserve and maintain
our university and its surround-
ing environment, we -- all of us
-- must continue the “green” ef-
forts we have already began and
create others when possible, not
just practical.

The environment isn’t some

ambiguous form that can be
solved at once. It is a series of
systems and we are capable of
tracing our system to its root
and beginning our undertaking
there. While helping to clean the
Chesapeake Bay is the recogniz-
able opposite-endpoint of our
route, we are not going to save
the Chesapeake Bay by setting
out to do exactly that.

We are too small and too few
to accomplish such a feat. But our
area of Virginia is a part of the
Bay Watershed, and Rockbridge
County is a part ofthis Virginian
area, and this university is a part
of Rockbridge County, and each
member of this university com-
munity is a part ofthis university
and it is there that we must start
cleaning the bay: with each of
our individual efforts.

Our minute efforts arejointly
ampliﬁed just like a single rain-
drop or a single drop of acid
dropped into our little Woods
Creek will eventually ﬂow into
the Maury River, which will
eventually flow into the James,
which will eventually flow into
the Chesapeake itself.

. The university is already do-
ing its part: installing energy-ef-
ﬁcient light bulbs, keeping the
temperature in student dormito-
ries at moderate levels so as to
conserve energy, working with
local food sellers to distance
itself. from chemicals and the
inhumane treatment of animals,
using recycled paper cups and
offering the option of re—usable
to-go trays at all meals and reno-
vating each building ofthe icon-
ic Colonnade to make it more
energy-efﬁcient.

But our university’s efforts
should reflect our individual at-

Respected Editor,

1 am writing to you today
to take issue with a piece pub-
lished in the February 8, 2011 is-
sue of the Ring-Tum Phi. When
ﬂipping through this paper the
other evening, I, as well as those
around me, was appalled by the
article entitled “Take me out to-
night to a frat party”.

After reading the dismissive
and generalizing statements
written with a condescending
tone, I could not decide whether
to laugh or cry. The way that this
columnist portrayed freshmen
girls at W&L was diﬂicult to
read—after all of the initiatives
to change the way that women
in our community are treated,
things like this are a big step
in the wrong direction. The use
of .valley girl-isms like “totes
adorbs”, discussion of trying to
“DFM” and looking “‘edgy-’ but
not slutty” is simply embarrass-
ing. I can speak for most of the
population in saying that I love
some quality satire, but this
was just distasteful arid tactless.
W&L girls are more than willing
to poke fun at themselves,’ but

this article was demeaning in a
way that crossed many a bound-
ary.
My feelings about this ar-
ticle aside, I think in the future
it is imperative to consider the
circulation of this newspaper.
I am never one for censorship,
but were I to pick up a copy of
the Phi as a prospective student
in the admissions ofﬁce, this ar-
ticle alone would have deterred
me from applying to Washington
and Lee. With W&L’s desires to
retain tradition while diversify-
ing its population, how does it
look to have a female member
of the community deriding her
peers like this? It makes this
place seem unwelcoming and
shallow, which I don’t believe

_ it is.

I look forward to quality
journalism in the future~—speak
your mind, opinion writers, but
consider your audience as well.

Sincerely,
Noel Price

titudes and work towards better-
ing the environment: we must
begin with ourselves.

Simple acts that may have
been previously seen as mean-

ingless inconveniences can
eventually change the health of
the bay.

To “restore the bay’s water
quality and fisheries,” Tillman
writes that “individuals...can
replace aging septic systems
with new nitrogen-reducing sys-
tems. Garbage disposals in our
sinks should not be ‘used at all.
Nor should we dump medicines
or pharmaceuticals down the
drains” (68).

To ﬁx “erosion, siltation, and
legacy sediments,” we should
“start learning more about natu-
ral processes and how our every-
day activities affect the water-
ways and the bay. Right in our
back yards we can begin shifting
focus ﬁ‘om encouraging water to
run off our land and instead en-
courage it to ﬁlter into the soil”
(25).

To combat “sea level rise”
we “can help immediately by
changing our wasteful energy
practices; We can stop buying
things we don’t need, because
it takes energy to create, dis-
tribute, maintain, and dispose of
things. Each of us can also help
create and articulate a vision of
a healthier earth to our friends,
families, and representatives. If
people lead, politicians will fol-
low” (I3-I4).

These suggestions are good
places to start, for we must start
somewhere.

Every member of this com-
munity has the potential to be-
come an environmentalist.

It’s not left-wing to be an

it



   

Being previously lost for a
(topic for‘ this week, I was actu-
fgally slightly relieved to receive
,§an email from our “respected
'f'editor” (Stockton was also ex-
{tremely pleased to be respected
‘(for once in his life) giving me
}-something to respond to.

3? First, I would like to thank

,,,the reader for reading my article.
zgsecond, I would like to thank the
Ereader for having an opinion of
Eher own; I appreciate construc-
lfitive criticism and understand that‘
fiputting my name on something
 asking for it to be published
 opening the door for potential
ijdisagreement.

 I want to be clear that my in-
iitent has always been, and will

  

’ ""always be, to playfully poke fun

at this uniform we seem to have
on this campus. Malicious is not
a word that comes into my vo-
cabulary and I have never, ever,
targeted an individual. Except
for Stockton. And he deserves
it.

The outﬁt I described in
“Take me out to a frat party” was
the exact same one that I wore
to the White Panda/Ghostland
Observatory concert (except my
going-out boots are Cole Haan,
which is even worse). I was that

environmentalist; it’s not right-
wing. It’s not the hip thing to
do, it’s not a bunch of ex Dead
Heads, it’s not wrong and it is
not some hobby.

It is a duty that each of us
owes the earth.

It is a justified and rightful
cause that rests in not only bet-
tering the world but bettering
ourselves.

We are not going to save the
Chesapeake alone. But it’s not
only about saving the Chesa-
peake. It’s about starting small,
with ourselves, and nurturing
the root of a thick and compli-
cated system of environments,
eco-systems and bio-regions.

It’s because Rockbridge
County is an environment that
depends on the well-being of the
Chesapeake Bay Watershed.

Because if we don’t start
somewhere, if we as individuals
and parts of a larger group allow
the Chesapeake to die, then what
else but the same fate can we ex-
pect for our university?

If we lose the Chesapeake, if
it becomes more over-polluted
and overrun and undesirable and
unﬁt for natural species, if we
allow these things to pass, the
university we love will never be
the same.

I am the topic. I am my
audience. So if I can take
being “demean[ed]” and
“embarrass[ed]” in a “conde-

“unwelcoming” and “shallow,”
then I should hope that everyone
could be in on the joke as well.

I sincerely apologize if any-
one else was offended by what
has been published in any of
my previous articles. But at the
same time, this is the opinions
section of a school newspaper,
one to which anyone is encour-
aged to contribute. So I ask, why
so serious?

handle it when someone criti- ‘

cizes my clearly Pulitzer-worthy
“quality journalism”. However,
I do not believe thatquestioning
someone’s character is the cor-
rect approach in bringing about
this criticism.

Organization hosts talent show to raise money and awareness for displaced victims of violence and revolution

By Collins Rice
STAFF warren

Every year, the members of
the Student Association for Inter-
national Learning (SAIL) focus
on raising awareness on campus
about a particular country in
need. This year, the organization,
which addresses international is-
sues and promotes exchanges
between diverse cultures repre-
sented at Washington and Lee,
has chosen to shed light upon the
violence in Kyrgyzstan.

On Friday, March 4, the club‘

will present its Showcase for
Kyrgyzstan, a fund-raising event

in the form of a talent show.

“We invite students from the
university to perform and com-
pete with their talents,” said
Bermet Zhumakadyr kyzy, the
event’s organizer.

In the two decades since
the breakup of the former So-
viet Union, the small central
Asian country of Kyrgyzstan
has struggled to attain political
stability. Despite showing signs
of development in the form of
civil society and a free press, the

revolution in the nation’s capital,
Bishkek. The event left 85 peo-
ple dead, the capital was looted
and Bakiyev was removed from
power. The country fell into so-
cial chaos and the violence in the
city spread into southern Kyr-
gyzstan in the form of inter-eth-
nic clashes.

Currently, the death toll re-
mains unclear. The official num-
ber is over 400, but many claim
that it exceeds l,000. More than

Clover Archer Lyle receives $8, 000 from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts

from the W&L News Office

Clover Archer Lyle, artist and
director ofthe Staniar Gallery in
Wilson Hall at Washington and
Lee University, has been award-
ed a 2011-2012 Fellowship by
the Virginia Museum of Fine
Arts (VMFA). The 18 fellowship
recipients will be recognized by
the General Assembly in Rich-
mond on Feb. 18. A luncheon
will follow at the VMFA.

Archer Lyle received a pro-
fessional fellowship for $8,000
in the area of drawing. She will
use the funds to continue work-
ing on her current body of work
which takes the Samuel Beckett
play “Waiting for Godot” as a
point of departure. The drawings
and cast resin objects from that

    
  
 

series will be exhibited at Page
Bond Gallery in Richmond in
February 2012.

Two fellowships, _includ-
ing Archer Lyle’s, were given
for drawing this year. The juror
for the professional fellowship
awards was Alison de Lima
Greene, curator of contemporary
art and special projects at the
Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.

Started in 1940 by Fredericks-
burg, Va., resident and museum
benefactor John Lee Pratt, the
Virginia Museum of Fine Arts
Fellowship Program supports
Virginia’s professional artists

and art students. Since its incep-
tion, the program has awarded

Senior Night ends withvictory  

T he ﬁnal home game for two W&L seniors closes with a 67-58 win over conference rival Randolph-Macon

By Mike Decembrino
STAFF WRITER

The ﬁnal home game for Washington
and Lee seniors Allie Long and Felice
Herman could not have turned out any
better as the Generals women’s basket-
ball team snapped the Randolph-Macon
College Yellow Jackets’ 12-game win
streak with a 67-58 victory on Tuesday
evening at the Warner Center.

Long and Herman were honored be-
fore the game for “Senior Night,” which
recognized thetremendous four year ca-
reers of both players.

Long and junior forward Becca
Bolton led the attack for the Generals.
Bolton scored 26 points, going 7-for-
l0 from the ﬁeld and connecting on all
12 of her free throws. Long played the
entire 40 minutes for the Generals and
keyed a 21-4 game winning second half
run in which she knocked down three 3-

pointers to ﬁnish with 13 points.

Earlier this year, W&L lost to ﬁrst
place Randolph-Macon on the road 72-
55. That, combined with the Jackets’
12-game winning streak and the Gen-
erals’ two game losing streak heading
into this game, would lead many to pick
R-MC as the favorite for this contest.
W&L Head Coach Mandy King thought
otherwise.

“We really didn’t pay attention to
their winning streak or our losing streak.
We just focused on what we had to do

for these 40 minutes,” King said. “We '

actually had a lot of conﬁdence [heading
into this game]. We had a great practice
yesterday and we were just excited for
the opportunity today.”

After Maggie Roy of the Jackets
scored the game’s ﬁrst ﬁeld goal two

seconds into the game, W&L went on a
6-0 run keyed by Bolton. The Generals
held onto the lead until Jordan Cantrell
of R-MC hit a 3-pointer in the comer
with 6:56 to play in the ﬁrst half to bring
the score to a 16-16 tie. -
Down by two points with 30 seconds
to play in the ﬁrst half, Bolton connect-
ed on a short-range jump shot to tie the
score at 26 going into half time. Bolton
went 6-for-6 from the ﬁeld in the ﬁrst

' half.

“I thought we were terriﬁc on the
defensive side of the ball,” King said of
the Generals ﬁrst half defensive perfor-
mance. They held R-MC’s top scorer,
Maggie Roy, to only two points and
blocked six shots in the ﬁrst half. Three
of those blocks came from sophomore
Rachel Warrick. »

Trailing 35-33 with 15:38 to play
in the second half, Long hit a 3-pointer
to make the score 36-35 in favor of the
Generals. This began the 21-4 run that
buried the Jackets. Long made two
more consecutive 3’s and junior guard
Meg Ingram added another to cap off
the run.

At the end of this run, the Generals
led 54-39 and never looked back. R-
MC made a push in the ﬁnal six minutes
thanks to the sharpshooting of Roy, but
it was not enough as the Generals held
on fortthe 67-58 win.

King was happy with the defense in
the second half as well. “We knew we
needed to maintain the pressure against
them and keep them from scoring points
in transition,” she said. The Generals
did just that, as they held the Jackets to

just 27.1% shooting from the ﬁeld.
Ingram scored 12 points and picked

up seven rebounds while sophomore,

Katy Wilson led the team with nine re-
bounds. The Generals shot 42% from
the ﬁeld, just above their season mark of
40.6%. - V
The win improves the Generals’ re-
cord to 14-7 overall and 10-6 in Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference play. They
have won seven of their last ten games
and are on track to make the ODAC
Conference Tournament to try to repeat
as champions. The Generals ﬁnish off

the regular season with a four game road ‘

trip beginning on February 11 at Guil-
ford College.

many as 8 and led 27-22 going into the
half, played a strong defensive game,
but chose poor shots throughout .the
game. Both teams played a messy ﬁrst
half, each making less than 30% of their
ﬁeld goal attempts.

First-year Drew Kimberly had the V ,

ﬁrst score of the game on a free throw,
putting the Generals up 1-0 30 seconds
into the game. Bridgewater answered a

minute later, as Rick Maloney hit a la-
yup to give the Eagles their ﬁrst 2 points
of the half. '

With sloppy play as the most promi-

nent factor of the ﬁrst half, neither team
seemed to be able to make an impact on
the court. The Eagles shot 60% from the
free throw line, while the Generals shot
50%. Both teams struggled from outside
the arch, with Bridgewater shooting fail-
ing to make a single 3-pointer.
Generals sophomore Jeremy Atkins
lead the team in the ﬁrst half with 12
points, and Bridgewater senior Maloney
added 9 points for the Eagles.

The Generals entered the second
half up by 5, but the game soon became
more heated as the Eagles scored 5 un-
answered points in the ﬁrst 4 minutes to
bring them within 2 points of the lead.

By the halfway mark of the second
half, Bridgewater had cut W&L’s lead to
one, and took the lead 47-46 on another
layup by Maloney.

From there the game was a back-
and-forth battle between the two teams.
Bridgewater lead by as many as 7 with
3:28 left in the second half, and for a

I moment it looked at if the Generals were

about to give up without a ﬁght.

W&L didn’t quit, however, and
scored 7 unanswered points to tie the
game up 60-60 on a layup from Kim-
berly assisted by sophomore JD Ey with
just under 2 minutes left in the game.

The Generals suffered a setback as

‘Bridgewater senior Kyle Hammond hit

a triple with just over one minute left
in the game, but scored 4 unanswered
thanks to ajumper by Atkins after Kim-
berly stole the ball with 27 seconds left.

The ﬁnal shots in the game came on
two three throws made by Hammond
after being fouled by W&L junior Kyle
Bond, which brought the Eaglesup 65-

64 with 13 seconds left. The Generals
inbounded the ball, but were unable to
score on a missed jumper by Atkins with
2 seconds left. -

The Generals were unable to beat out
Bridgewater on‘ what was senior Jason
Cimino’s last home game. Having lost
5 of their last 6 games, W&L will take
on Hampden-Sydney away at 7 pm on
February 14.

Men’s lacrosse preview

An in-depth look at the upcoming season for this year ’s Generals

By Justin Donati
STA FF w R lTE R

The 2011 W&L men’s lacrosse
program looks to rebound this year
after a disappointing 2010 season
(1 1-6 overall). Despite being left
out of pre-season Top 25 polls, ﬁfth
year head coach Gene McCabe be-
lieves that his 2011 squad has all
the necessary tools and talent to
achieve its goal of returning to the
NCAA tournament. F

Looking ahead, the team will
undoubtedly face some challenges
along the way. The most discern-
able roadblock is their schedule.
In addition to the teams difﬁcult.in
conference schedule, the Generals
will continue to face top ranked
powers such as Middlebury, and
Ohio Wesleyan. McCabe has also
arranged match-ups against two
new Top 25 teams, Salisbury and
Denison.

McCabe admitted that “this
year’s schedule will prove the ulti-
matetest of skill and talent for my
men.” However, McCabe is quick
to say that every team has to make
choices about how they perceive
challenges and adversity. In his
opinion, “to be the best you have
to play the best,” he
said.

onship team, when multiple play-
ers have the potential to ﬁnish the
season in the double-digit points
category,” said McCabe.

On the other side of the ball, the
defense continues to remain a sta-
ple of the Washington and Lee pro-
gram. Last year, the defense con-
ceded only 6.71 goals per game.

Although the defense has im-
proved year after year statistically,
Coach McCabe still sees room for

improvement. From his "observa-

tions, “the defense has been very
strong statistically, but collectively
the group struggles to hold the top
teams under 10 goals per game.”
In large part, McCabe recognizes
that overall team defense, which
includes midﬁelders, must im-
prove in order to prevail in the big
games.

The loss of two-year defensive
coordinator Jason Archbell ap-
peared troublesome for the defense
earlier this fall as the group looked
for leader to ﬁll his void. How-
ever, McCabe said, ‘‘I have been
impressed so far with the work
accomplished by Michael Kruger

experience with the Generals, he
will undoubtedly have to improve
the team’s extra man offense from
last year. As a special teams group
in 2009, the W&L men’s team
posted a national best 51 percent
conversion ratio. However, last
year that number fell to roughly 31
percent on the season. A

The coaching staff attributed
this decline in efﬁciency last year
to new personnel and a lack of
chemistry between the players on
the man-up unit. On the contrary,
they see this year group as much
more experienced and cohesive.

“For the most part, last years
unit remains intact, minus Will
Kiegler,” McCabe said.

Another part of their game that
the team will have to improve on is
its ability to successfully clear the
ball. McCabe asserted, “our clear-
ing percentage was not where we
wanted it to be last year.” In fact,
the team only managed to success-
fully clear the ball out of its defen-
sive half at a rate of 75 percent in
2010. ’

The team’s adjustments to its
, stick-work pro-

grams during the

Beyond the dif-
ﬁculty of this year’s
schedule, the Gen-
erals also face the
task of replacing
nine graduated se-
niors. The big-
gest setback comes
from the loss of Will
Kiegler, who posted
212 points for the
Generals over his
career. To replicate
the offensive production provided
by Kiegler and other graduates, the
players and coaching staff have ap-
proached this year with increased
testing standards that have forced
each player hone their skills and
become more rounded players.

The coaching staff has also re-
vamped some of its offensive and ,
defensive tactics to align with the
team’s renovated roster and abili-
ties. With this new approach in
place, McCabe recognizes that
the team has grown by leaps and
bounds from the end of last year.

Already in pre-season practices,
the team has demonstrated a more
balanced offensive attack then it
had in previous years. At the helm
are “a core group of four to ﬁve at-
tackmen and around six midﬁelders
that are regularly‘ producing scor-
ing opportunities on the offensive
side of the ball,” said McCabe.

In previous years the Generals
relied on one or two players to win;
however, this year’s“ squad is ﬁnd-
ing increased production from all
over the ﬁeld.

“This is the mark of a champi-

strengths ”

  
 

“If you look at the way we played the Lee Jackson
game this fall, and the way we dominated on the
defensive end of the ﬁeld, I feel confident saying

that our defense will again be one of our team 3

GENE McCABE, headcoach

who took over the reins following
Archbell’s departure.”

McCabe went on to explain that
“Kruger’s addition of new defen-
sive schemes, and his focus on
teaching better defensive mechan-
ics has already proven invaluable

to keeping the defense on track to‘

become a nationally ranked unit.”

“If you look at the way we
played the Lee Jackson game this
fall, and the way we dominated on
the defensive end of the ﬁeld, I feel
conﬁdent saying that our defense
will again be one of our team’s
strengths,” said the Generals’ head
coach. _

Nat Saint Laurent also returns
to the Generals’ coaching staff this
year. As a member of the coaching
staff during the 2009 championship
season, Saint Laurent knows what
it takes to win. Now heading what
looks to be a new and rejuvenated
offense, “Coach Saint Laurent’s
continuity and familiarity with the
Generals is perfectly suited to this
year’s players and program,” said
McCabe.

Even with Coach Saint Laurent’s

  /as  

off-season targeted
this exact vulner-
ability. Now with
increased stick-han-
dling ability from
the defense down
to the attack, “as
a coaching staff, I
don’t think we have
any glaring weak-
nesses, but we need
to prove that on the
ﬁeld” said the ﬁfth-
year head coach.

With all of the modiﬁcations
made to the team during the off-
season, the biggest unknown head-
ing into 2011 remains the starting-
goalie position. After graduating
starting goalies in back,-to-back
years, the team must ﬁnd a man ca-
pable of commanding the defense,
and quickly dishing the ball to
midﬁelders who have been trained
to push transition opportunities.

McCabe has four players con-

tending for the starting role at

goalie. Two are veteran seniors that
have both seen time between the
pipes. Regardless of who takes the
starting nod, with a strong defense
behind them, McCabe feels conﬁ-
dent that whoever wins the job will
have an outstanding season.

Now the real question that re-
mains to be seen is whether or not
the Generals will get off to a hot
start in the beginning of their sea-
son. Playing three of its ﬁrst four
games against teams that were in
the NCAA tournament last year,
the Generals must come out of this
ﬁrst stretch rather unblemished if it

hopes to keep alive any dream
of reaching the Division III
playoffs.
The team begins its season
on Tuesday, February 15, as it
' takes on Ferrum College (5:00
PM) on Wilson Field. Fans
are strongly encouraged to at-
tend the game, as it marks the
ﬁrst time in national lacrosse
history that a men’s team will
sponsor the Green Dot Pro-
gram, an initiative that trains
individuals how to look for
and prevent sexual assault and
misconduct.

Meal Plan Equivalency system gives students who miss dinner in the Marketplace credit to eat in Cafe 77

By Kelsy Mccraw
STAFF WRITER

Students
who m1s.s
dmner will
once a a1n
get ere 1t to-

wards meals
at Cafe ‘7 7 .

As of 7 p.m. Sunday, students with
a Marketplace meal plan will receive
$5.85 worth of credit in Cafe ‘77 should
they miss the cut-off time in D-Hall.

Before this academic school year, this
Meal Plan Equivalency (MPE) system
was the norm. During the 2008-2009
school year, students received $5.25 of
credit if they missed D-Hall dinner, and
$5.50 for the 2009-2010_school year.

Beginning this fall, instead of the
MPE system, Dining Services increased
student’s food debit from the $50 of
2009-20l0 to $175.

Assistant Director of Cafe’ ’77, Den-
nis Fowler said that the decision was
based on student responses in their an-
nual Dining Services survey.

“We picked up that...[students]
would like to use their ﬂex dollars, you

know, have a choice where and when to
use them and at various units,” he said.

To reach the $ I 75 ﬁgure, Fowler says
that Auxiliary Services averaged the
amount of money each student account
had spent in the Co-Op/Cafe’ ’77 over a
previous term. _ 5

However, concerns from students to-
wards the end of fall term suggest that
this ﬁgure may not have been enough.
Fowler said the change, which mostly
affects ﬁrst-year students and RA’s, be-
gan to be an issue towards the end of fall
term when students began running out
of food debit.

Sophomore Executive Committee
Representative Jack Apgar set up an EC
taskforce at the beginning of the aca-
demic year to work with students and
Fowler to address any Dining Services
problems.

According to Apgar, student-athletes
brought this speciﬁc issue to light when
they ﬁequently missed D-Hall dinner
for sports practices. These students ran
out of food debit ﬁrst and were left with-
out any means for dinner.

Apgar worked with students, Fowl-
er, Associate Athletic Director Shana
Levine and Field Hockey Coach Wendy
Orrison to obtain the MPE system only
for athletes in the winter. However, Ap-
gar and Fowler said they think extend-
ing the MPE system to the entire student

body is a good idea.

Fowler said that the MPE system
should solve the issue of students run-
ning out offood debit and not being able
to get dinner. ~

“You won’t just run out of ﬂex dol-
lars, you can use them all because the
meal plans reset each week,” he said.

Students will be able to voice their
opiiiions about which dining plan they
like better in the Dining Services an-
nual survey in the ﬁrst week of April.
But even if students decide they like the
MPE best, Fowler said they should not
expect the same amount «of money for
the MPE.

Fowler set the $5.85 amount for
MPE in the fall for athletes, and admits
that the amount might ‘be a little high.
He says that, in the past, the ﬁgure was
calculated over the summer. However,
the time-crunch, larger athlete appetite
and smaller amount of student-athletes
versus the entire ﬁrst-year class inclined
him to give them a little more.

Fowler says he will keep the $5.85
for this year because the computer sys-
tem that allocates students’ meal plans
via their swipe card can only be set to
one dollar amount. '

“lt’s already in place, it’s set, and I
don’t want to change that. It is up there
a little bit. and we’ve already issued the
extra ﬂex dollars for this term,” he said.

“Now, next year, I really can’t tell you

for sure at this point what either would

be.”

Fowler says that calculating these
ﬁgures is a very intricate process that
looks at myriad of factors.

While a dinner in the Marketplace
costs $9.63, students receive less money
to spend in Cafe ’77 on the MPE.

Using last year’s $5.50 credit, there
is a $4.13 difference in the two amounts.
This is the amount of money that the
Marketplace needs to pay their ﬁxed
costs.

Fowler said the Marketplace’s ﬁxed
costs include the price of the ﬁxed
amount of food that they prepare each
night and the price of labor to prepare
and serve that food. The $5.50 that the
student receives in the MPE represents
the amount of money the Marketplace
needs to pay their variable costs (those
dependent on the number of students
who eat at each meal).

Ifa student opts to use his or her MPE
instead of meal in the Dining Hall, that
$5.50 is credited to Cafe’ ’77. This din-
ing unit has fewer ﬁxed costs because
they make their meals by the order. So,
the $5.50 covers their variable costs (the
price of the meal prepared), their ﬁxed
costs (the price of labor in Cafe ’77),
and their proﬁt margin. ‘

Fowler could not comment on the

amount of proﬁt made by Dining Ser-
vices on one meal.

The Marketplace and Cafe’ ’77 are
two different entities that operate sepa-
rately. The Marketplace operates as part
of the Room and Board of the Univer-
sity. Cafe’ ’77 operates as a for-proﬁt re-
tail unit. Since the W&L is a non-proﬁt
university, the Marketplace only needs
enough money to offset its costs.

To calculate the ﬁgure at which
Fowler sets the MPE, he must look at
the ﬁxed and variable costs of each din-
ing unit each year, and determine what
dollar amount is needed to keep both
operational.

According to Fowler, the MPE and
food debit plan cost the same amount.

“It doesn’t really make any differ-
ence to us one way or the other. I mean,
it wasn’t set up as a big ﬁnancial gap.
That wasn’t the issue we were trying to
answer,” he said.

The yearlong Marketplace meal plan
with the MPE cost $5125 in 2009-2010.
The same meal plan with increased food
debit cost $5250 for this academic year.
Fowler said the $I25 is not reﬂective of
the $125 increase in food debit, but is
reﬂective of the natural inﬂation of food
prices.

Stable comes to W&L computers

ITS says virtual desktop system has great potential but many students are still uncomfortable with the change

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

American Saddlebred, Morgan and
American Paint~these are the options
that students have to choose from after
they sign in to one ofthe lab computers
on the I00-level ofthe library.

These three horse-named options

represent three different virtual desktops-

that students can access through a soft-
ware program called The Stable that ITS
has been designing and testing for over
a year.

The Stable virtual desktop allows
faculty, staff and students access to soft-
ware programs, printers and the W&L
network storage drives, such as the L
drive and H drive, from anywhere on or
off campus. A connection is madevia
the Internet from any computer with The
Stable installed on it to a central data‘

hub located in the ITS ofﬁces.

According to an article published in a
recent employee newsletter, The Stable
includes three different virtual desk-
tops:

I. Adobe software, such as Pho-
toshop, Illustrator, Fireworks and In-
Design, running on Windows 7, on the
“American Paint” desktop.

2. Software most commonly used
at W&L, including Microsoft Office,
Outlook, as well as discipline-speciﬁc
software such as Stata, SPSS, ArtStor
and various politics-related software, all
running on Windows 7, on the “Ameri-
can Saddlebred” desktop.

3. Science and math-related soft-
ware, such as Maple, Matlab and Arc-
GIS, running on Windows XP, on the
“Morgan” desktop.

Students can access The Stable

through certain computers on
campus, but they

can also access it through their own
computers by going to thestable.wlu.edu
and signing in with their university login
information.

ITS Director Jeff Overholtzer said
that the software that students need to
complete their assignments in many
modern-day classes are costly, leaving
many students with no option but to do
their work in one ofthe computer labs
scattered about campus.

“I can’t think of a discipline that
doesn’t have discipline-speciﬁc soft-
ware,” said Overholtzer. “[And] people
don’t want to be tethered by physical de-
vices like labs" K

This is where The Stable comes into
play. This new software allows students
to access almost any program that they
would ﬁnd on a computer located in a
lab on campus from wherever they de-
sire.

There are some limitations to the soft-
ware, however. The speed of programs

that consume a lot ofdata resourc-
es, particularly those

or video, is not as
fast as it would be
on an on-campus
computer.

“It can be a little
not smooth,” said
Overholtzer as‘ he
watched a jerky You-

Tube video via an In-
ternet connection es-
tablished through the
American Paint virtual
desktop.

 .. that deal with audio

Every fall, members of ITS give a
presentation to the EC regarding any big
changes that were made to the technolo-
gy systems on campus over the summer.
Since this falls presentation, the EC has
been voicing concerns over the student-
friendliness ofThe Stable to ITS.

Steele Burrow_ is the EC liaison to
ITS, and he has been meeting regularly
with Overholtzer to discuss waysThe

‘Stable can be improved. Burrow said
that the EC understands that it is im-
portant for students to do their job and
do well in their classes, and he and the
other members do not want to have this
new computer system stand in the way
of that.

Burrow has proposed several chang-
es to The Stable’s interface that would
make it more intuitive for students, in-
cluding having instructions of how to
navigate The Stable right on the login
page, and making printing capabilities in
The Stable easier to access. In response
to student feedback, a “printers” folder
was recently added to The Stable’s desk-
tops.

Many students say they do not feel
comfortable using The Stable because
they have no idea what it is. One day
students had standard Windows desk-
tops, and the next day they had Ameri-
can Paints and Saddlebreds.

The sudden advent of The Stable is
a frustration for students who are look-
ing to just quickly perform some quick
task. Burrow said he feels that students
might not be as receptive to something
“when they feel like it is being forced
upon them too much.”

While this change to The Stable vir-
tual desktop seems to have a lot of po-
tential for students, it is a change that
will require a bit oflearning and research
on their part. There are easy-to-access

resources that students can use to help

them learn how to navigate The Stable’s
interface and effectively use this new
tool that is available to them.

Jina Park. who works at the help desk
in the library and frequently ﬁelds ques-
tions about The Stable from students,
said that she believes the most useful
tool available to students who want to
learn about The Stable is the video tu-
torial that can be accessed through the
ITS website. The ITS website is also
home to a Q&A style help guide called
the “Knowledge Base" that contains a
wealth ofinformation about The Stable.

Ifstudents still have further questions,
they also have the option of calling the
help desk and speaking with someone
who has received some training on how
to use The Stable, such as Park.

Even with the existence ofall ofthese
help resources, Burrow said the EC will
continue to voice its concerns, as well
as any concerns it hears from students,
related to The Stable.

nationwide search for a new provost.
Aprille jumped at the chance.

“I was so‘ impressed with the beauty
of the campus, the spirit of the campus
and the people there,” Aprille said of her
ﬁrst visit to Lexington.

According to Aprille, the provost of
a university is “the leader of the entire
academic mission.” In her four years at
W&L she has spearheaded several new
initiatives including the new undergrad-
uate spring term and revisions to the
third year program at the law school.

Aprille said that the helpful and sup-
portive staff and faculty at W&L made
these new programs much easier.

“I was so impressed with the cooper-

In addition to all her academic areas
of power, Aprille said there is one issue
that she likes to joke is the “most sig-

dents may remember from last year’s
snow-pocalyptic winter, the provost is
in charge of deciding whether or not to
cancel school.

“There’s a lot of factors that go in,”
Aprille said. The provost has to deter-

mine the best way to protect the safety
of students, faculty and staff without
compromising the school’s goals, she
said. ‘

In about three months, Aprille,won’t
have to worry about those tough deci-
sions anymore. She plans to move up
to New Hampshire after her retirement
where she will paint, ﬂy ﬁsh and “take a
breath and reflect.”

Aprille said her age is one factor in
her decision to retire. She’ll be turning
66 this year, and she said she wanted to

Letters author speaks at

“Letters are personal histories,” said
Pamela Newkirk, editor of Letters from
Black America. Newki,rk’s book is a
compilation of letters that address the
coverage of Black America in the me-

issue today.

Newkirk discussed the research for
the book with members of the W&L

letters in the book are letters from Abra-

opinions

  

totheeditor  

On a cold February day I walked from my office to the history department
of VMI, and along the way I encountered numerous cadets who must have been
en route to their classes. About 98 percent of them greeted me by saying: “Good
afternoon sir.” Most managed to smile as they said it. Not only did their greet-
ings make me feel good, they reassured me that there is a speaking tradition. It
is alive and well at VMI, but not on our own campus where we often boast about
our community and its tradition of civility. Whether members of our community
feel like greeting others or not, there is one very practical reason for speaking to
people you encounter on the campus: we are a private school, and the person you
choose to ignore might be a wealthy benefactor. You may not know this but your
tuition pays only about 52 percent of the cost of your college education. The
remainder comes from benevolent benefactors. Both white and black alumni are
often appalled upon returning to campus to ﬁnd that most students will neither
speak nor make eye contact. Unfortunately, this is not only a student problem.
Some faculty members refuse to speak as well. .

As an alumnus ‘of W&L whose affiliation with the college began in 1963, I
am often aghast at the fact that so many folks turn their heads or eyes as I ap-
proach. As a faculty member, who makes every attempt to be accommodating
to students, I am sometimes insulted when students enrolled in my classes avoid
speaking. Everyone has a bad day and sometimes do not want to be bothered.
Butcome on folks, speaking is no big inconvenience! Ironically some students
who do not speak are ‘clad in t—shirts with the word Speak plastered across their
chests. Another practical reason for speaking/is that it might uplift the spirits of
someone in our community is depressed or has low‘ self-esteem. ’

'I recently addressed the Birmingham, Alabama chapter of the W&L alumni
association, and one alumnus raised his hand to ask about the speaking tradition.

 

‘His name is Preston Sartelle, and he graduated in 1999. I initiallyencountered

him on campus during his ﬁrst year, and found him to be one of the friendliest
young men I have ever met. He was an SAE and a native of Mississippi. Preston
always enthusiastically greeted me but never took one of my classes. He was a
Spanish major. Now and then we would have brief conversations. As graduation
approached he invited me to join his family for lunch. We had a great time and
his parents wanted to know how we had gotten to know one another. We both
instinctively replied: “Through the Speaking Tradition.” , '

As much as we like to connect the speaking tradition with the gift of the
Doremus family-those New Yorkers of long ago who found the hospitality of an
anonymous student so impressive that they gave us a gym-I think the time has
come for us to write the epitaph for the speaking tradition; W&L needs to stop
boasting about something that so much of our community has rejected. When
I answered Preston’s question in Birmingham, I.took my cell phone out and
pretended that I was texting. So often students begin to text or at least pretend to
do so as I approach. Is this what our community has become? If so, I think that

is very sad.

It’s Formal Season & Ali Greenberg has a few tips for girls and boys

By Ali Greenberg
COLUMNIST

Although no one really knows.

whether we are in winter or spring,
there is one thing that I am sure of; it is
most deﬁnitely Formal Season.

Formal Season runs from February
Break to Spring Break and is character-
ized by two main issues: who to take
and what to wear?

First, getting a date. If you are a girl
you have, luckily, a few more choices.
You can take the best guy friend (gal-
pal), your visiting brother/cousin, a girl,
or if you are feeling adventurous-maybe
someone you actually like.

I give you major

to her formal. She told me she was sick
of taking dates she didn’t want to hook
up with and ended up running away
from. She invited me because she knew
I was a sure thing.

So after you actually land a date
regardless of gender/sexual orienta-
tion/familial relations, the battle is only
halfway over.

Remember, you still need an outﬁt.
You can’t just show up naked. (I had a
joke here but some people said it wasn’t
funny.)

To all the prospective male students

The same goes for a $30 Ameri-
can Apparel dress. Do not wear it on
a booze cruise around the Baltimore
Harbor. Learn from my mistakes, some
dresses are just too small. I now wear
it as a top.

One thing I have to give credit for is
that the girls at this school do clean up
well. This is probably due to our large
cocktail dress budget. I counted, and
on average we wear 10-15 semi-formal
dresses a year.

But, no matter what we are wearing,
girls see formals as the opportunity to
act ridiculous with-

props if you invite
your date yourself,
but my money is
on that most of you

chicken out and
make your friend set
you up.

While I generally
don’t hesitate to ask

Whatever route you take, we are all looking for the
same thing. Girls just want someone who is going to
stay by their side, be attentive, be capable of danc-

ing and be properly groomed prior to the event.

forrnals are also a
time where we feel
proud that, for once,
we are supplying the
beer for an event.

date showed up in jorts, a t-shirt and a
madras jacket. You have all been fairly
warned.

their side, be attentive, be capable of

to the event. »

Somehow, we keep forgetting that
we attend Washington & Lee.

_If you cant ﬁnd that in a guy, take a
girl. In the fall, I was a girIfriend’s date

who read my articles and hopefully
aren’t deterred from applying, I advise
you to invest in a tuxedo early, as you
will likely need to wear one at least
four times during your Washington &
Lee career.

For the ladies, when it comes to
picking a dress, it really isjust a simple
matter of taste, regardless of price. If a
Herve Leger dress is short, do not wear
it two nights in a row to get down on
the dance ﬁoor in Charlottesville. It will
ride up, and you will give a bus trip full
of freshman boys a show. '

that sucks.

Regardless of your date or outﬁt, just
have fun and be safe this formal season,
and above all be a good date.

A few things not to do would be to
fall asleep outside the tent, leave your
date to go to another party, have a ward-
robe malfunction, or accidently lock
your date out of the hotel room.

And a ﬁnal hint for the boys, we ac-
tually just want you to stand there and
look pretty as well. No seriously. Don’t
talk. Just dance. -

' Egypt an accident waitingto happen

After two months of revolutionary protests rock the Muslim world, John Paul Beall urges America to be cautious

By John Paul Beall
COLUMNIST

There is hardly a foreign policy is-
sue today that has received more atten-
tion than Egypt’s revolution and their
leaders, Hosni Mubarak, resignation.
Even in the immediate short term the
results have been powerful, as Tunisia’s
and Libya’s revolutionaries have begun
to take up arms. These arethe results of
over a century ofpolitical instability and
international interference in the Mus-
lim third world. There is one thing that
America needs to consider at this point:
caution.

The political climate in Egypt has
been tumultuous over the last one hun-
dred years. It began under British con-
trol, lumped in with Sudan for admin-
istrative purposes and underneath a
puppet monarch.y.

During World War II, Egypt was the
focus ofa German push to the Suez Ca-
nal and subject to some of the hardest
ﬁghting in the war at El-Alamein. After
the war, Egypt obtained independence

as a democracy, only to have their sys-
tem become the domain of the military,
which has selected most of its Presidents
for the duration of its independence, in-
cluding President Mubarak.

The Muslim world has had similar
strife. The Muslim world was remark-
ably stable before World War I., at least
compared to now. The Ottoman Empire
was a long ruling authority over a great
expanse of the Middle East. The reign
of the Sultan hearkened back to the time
of a pan-Islamic authority under the Ca-
liphs. But during World War I, the Ot-
toman Empire saw great military action
and was forced through the meat grinder
in the subsequent peace. ‘

The Empire was carved up into coun-
tries with artiﬁcial borders and then oc-
cupied by Great Britain and France. The
two major impetuses were oil for naval
power and position for the safety of the
Suez Canal. The tribal societies of these
areas did not respond well to being di-

vided and thrown into the mix with
other parts of tribes.Instability and tribal
warfare ensued. Evidence is everywhere
in the current region, including Somalia,
Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

These states eventually won inde-
pendence with the rest of the various
imperial holdings after World War II,
only after the areas in Northern and
Eastern Africa witnessed Axis advance
and Allied counter-attack. Similar con-
ditions arose as military dictatorships,
some with tribe backing, became the
norm. Then, the conﬂict between the
Soviets and NATO began, and the stage
on which the drama played out included
large parts of the Middle East. Oil com-
panies began to wield power in the re-
gion. America intervened in regions all
over this area, including Kuwait, Iraq,
Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Syr-
ia, Lebanon and Turkey. The develop-
ment of these countries has been stilted
in the face of continuous conﬁict.

The point of all this background is to
demonstrate that if America further in-
tervenes in the system, results will only
back-ﬁre. In the wake of the bad foreign
policy of interventionalism, the view of
the United States has become extremely
poor. Bear in mind that America sup-
ported the Egyptian regime on multiple
occasions.

America needs to watch what hap-
pens, to be sure, but that is all it should
be doing at this point. Granted, it is an
oily situation already, but America is still
involved in a war in the Islamic region.

The reaction will only be that America is .

only continuing to perpetuate the order
of Western interference.

Should things take an extreme turn
for the worse, it would be wise to recon-
sider the issue. But, the bottom line is
that America has too many problems at
home to consider, for the moment, delv-
ing deeper into affairs abroad.

At this point it would be wise to keep

in mind the words of Calvin Coolidge,
“nothing I never said ever did me any
harm,” and remain aloof. America can
not force freedom at gunpoint, or not
anymore at least. The inhabitants of
Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and the entire
Muslim world must create for them-
selves a goal to which they aspire as a
country before America can offer as-
sistance. Otherwise, severe legitimacy
issues will continue barragejthe most
war-tom region on Earth.

Need help with the internship hunt?

Mac Davis introduces the Internship Opportunity Intiative, a new student run program to ease the internship search

By Mac Davis
CONTRIBUTOR

- Don’t miss out on this first year
of the W&L IOI internship program.
- It‘s exciting. its simple to apply.
- Career Services staff is standing
by«.to assist you. V
- The odds are in YOUR favor!

Are you looking for an internship this

summer? Well 14 of your fellow stu-

dents have spent the last year working
with a new student run program called
the Internship Opportunity Initiative
(IOI) to make your internship a reality.
These students contacted members of
the W&L family including current and
former parents, alumni and their own
personal contacts to recruit great experi-

ential internships for you this summer. .

Emphasizing W&L student’s superi-
or academic reputation and social skills,
we were successful in getting exclusive
opportunities not available to the general
population. The program was designed
to make the internship process easy for
employers to hire and students to apply.

Many of the IOI’s internships are
available only to W&L students. This
means that you will be competing with
a smaller group of applicants signiﬁ-
cantly increasing your chance of being
selected. We think these internships are
a great opportunity for W&L students,

and all of us at IOI hope you will take.

advantage of the opportunities

We are very lucky to be working
with companies and agencies includ-
ing BB&T Scott and Stringfellow, the
Kentucky Court of Justice, the Salem
Red Sox, the Richmond SPCA, Walker
& Dunlop Real Estate, the Sierra Club,
Price Weber Mass Marketing and Com-
munications, the Boston Mayors Otﬁce,
Barton Barton & Plotkin LLP, Mead-
Westvaco and the highly successful ﬁ-_
nancial ﬁrm Copper Rock Capital. Other
internships are being added weekly.

All of these internships provide a
level of substantive work experience
and responsibility that is not typically
given to interns. Speciﬁcally students
will have the opportunity to write court

decisions, help create interactive web-
sites for fortune 500 companies, research
equity investments, engage directly in
sports management, do clinical work
under the oversight of a veterinarian, as
well as write press releases, and lead and
develop PR campaigns.

To view and apply for the internships
please go online to W&L JobLink from
the Career Services homepage (careers.
wlu.edu). 101 will also be holding a spe-
cial information session next Wednes-
day (March 16th) at 7pm in" the Career
Services Center for all those interested.

If you see Jimmy Pickle, Ben Oddo,
Olivia Burr, Elizabeth Ward, Maggie
Thomas, Katie Stewart, Ben Turnbull,

Katharine Price, Elizabeth Bean, Les-
lie Peard, Bobby Rutherford, Cantey
Hittink, or Tyler Grant around campus
please let them know their work is ap-
preciated.

After our pilot year IOI is proud of
what we have accomplished, and we are
looking’ forward to growing in the ﬁl-
ture. Please keep an eye out on Campus
Notices for leadership positions within
IOI in the coming weeks.

Smart phones: essenlial to life

Pat Smith endangers himself by living without his Droid smart phone for a day

By Patsmith
COLUMNIST

In this day and age, technology plays a
vital role in everyday life. Try and remem-
ber the last time you spent the day without
your cell phone. No, this does not mean the
time you fell in the river behind the pole
houses and forgot your cell phone was in
your pocket. You know who you are.

I am talking about legitimately being
without your cell phone for the entirety of
the day. For thepurpose of sound joumal-
ism, I decided to spend an entire day, in-
cluding going out, without the use of my
proid smart phone.

The ﬁrst few hours of my day without my

the cell phone industry trended into produc-
ing the smallest possible cell phones that it
could. Too bad it did not realize people ac-
tually like to read their text messages.

For today’s standards, one must always
have their smart phone. If you are one of
the few Americans out there that still does
not have a smart phone, congratulations,
you are now dumber than your stupid flip
phone.

Smart phones are incredible and can do
so many things that it should be illegal in
all’50 states, Puerto Rico, and Canada. Just

it was actually 270.

Another leap the world of technology has
been in the tablet computer industry. I can-
not even begin to describe how badly I want
an iPad. The iPad does so many different
things, and they are all completely useless.
Sounds like a perfect match for me.

Maybe one day I will nut up and turn my
dreams into a reality by purchasing an iPad.
But until then, I will have to make due with
my Droid and my $1500 MacBook. '

Droid went swimmingly.
I reconnected with nature,
volunteered at the soup

teen elderly people cross
the street.

By midday, I started
to feel the effects of with-
drawal. My speech began to slur, my ability
to operate heavy machinery went down the
tube, as did my ability to make sound deci-
sions. Or was I drunk?

When it was time to go out for the night,
I slightly resembled Golem from Lord of
the Rings. The only thing that kept me alive
was a Bruce Springsteen cover band... (I
had to mention New Jersey in some facet.)

I managed to survive this ordeal, de-
spite a sticky situation involving a clown,
barbed wire, and Kevin from Stop-in. Go-
ing through the day without a cell phone is
manageable, but not recommended.

Technology has taken huge leaps over
the past years. I remember way back when
during elementary school, my dad had a cell
phone the size of the Taco Bell dog. Then,

able to answer all of my emails, Google the

my mother - the only important things in
my life.

When choosing a smart phone, there are
several different routes you can take. The
classic Blackberry route is for beginners
and noobs. The iI’hone route is for posers
and Steve Jobs gal-pals. If you want to be
a professional, go with any Android phone.
When they say, “Droid Does,” they mean
it.

Brazilian dinner a hit for   students, staff I  

I-House hosts a cultural cooking lesson and dinner of regional fare, focuses on South America 3 largest country

By Jamie Kim
STAFF WRITER

Inside the International House on ‘

Friday, March 12, a group of 20 peo-
ple clustered around the stove in the
kitchen for the Brazilian cooking les-
son. Once stepping inside the kitchen,
the sizzling and boiling sound of the in-
gredients could be heard. The smell of
sweet olive oil surrounded everyone as
meat and rice were being cooked.

At the lesson, Gaby Sampaio,-a se-
nior exchange student from Manaus,
Brazil, explained the process of making
fried rice.

“Usually in Asia, to make fried rice,
we’ll ﬁrst cook the rice in water and
then fry it with oil. But in Brazil, they

reverse the process,” said ﬁrst year stu--

dent Christy Cui. “They fry raw rice

son and four-cheese pasta lesson held in
the same venue. This is also not her ﬁrst
time having Brazilian food.

“My ﬁrst year here I worked part
time in the Environmental Studies pro-
gram. Professor Kahn, who has a con-
sortium in Manaus, Brazil, had a little
party at his house for his students. So
he cooked traditional Brazilian food,”
said Karsch, “That’s the ﬁrst time I had
Brazilian food.”

Dan Boccio, a ﬁrst-year student, said
he came to the event to become famil-
iar with the Brazilian ‘food and culture

where he showed step-by-step how to
cook various kinds of food.”

The video was a greattutorial for
the Brazilian students who do not cook
very often. With the instructions person-
ally delivered by Femandez’s father, the
students had held‘ a “rehearsal” a week
earlier to make sure they knew how to
cook.

The cooking lesson was a great suc-
cess and satisﬁed many of the people
who attended the event. Sophomore
Haley Miller, who will also study
abroad in Manaus with the Environ-
mental Studies program, said this was
her ﬁrst time attending acooking lesson
on campus.

“I would deﬁnitely

cook the rice. That’s
why I think it’s interest-

jng » food. It makes people eat together, talk together

This was the start of
a lively exchange and
discussion on the dif-
ferent ways and styles
of cooking in different
cultures. From cooking
pasta with the ﬁre shut off to making
candy out of scratch and putting ketchup
and mustard on top of pizza, people en-
gaged in delightful conversations while
waiting for the food to get prepared.

After an hour of demonstrations and
preparations, the dinner of Picadinho
(ground beef with vegetable), fried rice,
beans, banana, and a dessert called Bri-
gadeiro, Brazilian chocolate bonbon,
was ready.

“Bananas with beans and rice are
something I never would have tried

- otherwise,” said junior Callie Hughes,

“It was so good.”

tistical Specialist at Leybum Library,

“The food was delicious,” said Boc-
cio. “[The Brazilian students] did a per-
fect job.” \

Guillermo Fernandez, another ex-
change student from Manaus and one
of the students who led the cooking les-
son, said they decided to cook Picadin-
ho, rice, and beans because it is simple,
everyday Brazilian food.

“I have been living in the I-House
for two months, and I have always
cooked frozen food for my meal. Ev-
eryone made fun of me that I couldn’t
cook, and I got tired of it,” said Feman-
dez. “I sent my dad an email and asked
him to teach me something that is rela-

tively easy and inexpensive to cook. My I

dad, the most amazing person I know,

come again for more
events like this,” said
Miller.

Others said they
especially enjoyed in-
teracting with the stu-
dents.

“I never would have
thought of having ba-
nanas with meat. But
they told me that’s how they eat, and
I just chopped off the banana and put
it on my plate,” said Mae Chandler, an
employee at the University Bookstore.
“What I enjoyed even more than the
food was talking to the students. I had
a wonderful time with them.”

“The most important thing is having
good food,” said Sampaio. “It makes
people eat together, talk together, and
have a good time. You can meet people
that you usually don’t meet elsewhere
on campus. You can share a little bit of
your own culture.”

lay for Life is coming to Washington
and Lee. It is an event that celebrates
cancer survivors and remembers loved
ones lost. It is also a chance for the
W&L community to join together and
raise money for the ﬁght against caner.

Participants take turns walking
around the track all night to raise money
for cancer research. Since the ﬁrst Relay
for Life, over 3.5 million people from
over twenty different countries have

joined together to raise awareness.
Relay for Life will kick offon March
18 at 7 p.m. on Cannan Green and will
last all night long. Ending at 7 a.m. the
next morning, there will be plenty of ac-

tivities in between to keep participants.

entertained. At the start of the event, as
tradition dictates, there will be a Survi-
vors Lap, where everyone can acknowl-
edge and help celebrate another victory
over cancer.

There will also be the customary
Luminaria Ceremony after dark and
participants can purchase a luminaria in

honor or memory of a survivor. The Lu-
minaria Ceremony takes time to remind
us of those touched by cancer and those
still battling.

Finally, the last Relay for Life tra-
dition is the Fight.Back Ceremony. At
the ceremony, participants can make a
personal commitment to save lives by
taking up the ﬁght against cancer. The
commitment can range from doing
something as simple as having a screen-
ing test to something as large as talking
to an elected official. Throughout the

night, there will be plenty of activities '

. Letters basis for
new play ;

Professors and students create a ploy from Lexington is

letters to the editors

By Collins Rice
STAFF WRITER

' Last week, the Theater de-
partment held auditions for its
spring presentation of “Letters
to the Editor,” a play born out of
over two hundred years of letters
to the editors of Lexington news-
papers. Sponsored by the The-
ater and Journalism departments,
the idea for the play was taken
from a production done by Penn-
sylvania’s Bloomsburg Theatre
Ensemble in the mid-nineties.
The auditions, which took place
last Tuesday and Thursday, were
open to both members of Spring
Term Theater 231 and the Lex-
ington community at large.

Although formal production
is just beginning, “Letters to the
Editor” has been in the works
for quite some time. In fact, the
play’s beginnings may be traced
back to I997, when Washington
and Lee’s own professor Pam
Luecke saw a performance of
the original Bloomsburg Theater
Ensemble’s script at a meeting of
the American Society of News-
paper Editors in Washington
D.C.

Afterenthusiastically relaying
the play’s plot to her colleagues
for several years, the desire for a

‘ Lexington speciﬁc version grew

within the Journalism and The-
ater departments, until Professor
Kimberly Jew decided to begin"
developing the project while on
sabbatical last winter term. By
summertime, the project hit full
swing when Professor Doug
Cumming of the Journalism
department along with Profes-
sor Jew and four Robert E. Lee
Scholars, senior Anna Hermes-
man, senior John McWilliams,
junior Eleanor Kennedy and
junior Zoe Yarborough. began
plowing through over two hun-
dred years of letters to the editor
sent to Lexington newspapers.
Although the idea of a play
centered around letters to the
editor has been done before-the-
ater group in Gainesville, Flori-

da wrote its own version inspired
by the Bloomsburg production
as well - Cumming believes
prior authors selected letters
to dramatize in a random way;
such was not the case for W&L’s

“Letters to the Editor.” As a me-

dia historian, it was paramount
to Cumming that the research
stage of the play be performed as
thoroughly and systematically as
possible.

Jew instructed the team to
look for theatrical elements
within the letters such as action,
a voice, character, personality
and elements that reﬁected lo-
cal color, as they combed let-
ters from the Lexington Gazette
(now known as The Lexington
News-Gazette), The Rockbridge
County News, The VMI Cadet
and the Ring-tum Phi for mate-
rial. A system was created in
which each team member was
assigned a time period each day
for which he or she was respon-
sible for reading and catego-
rizing the letters from a given
newspaper. Several months and
more than 8,300 letters later, the
task of creating a production out
of more than two hundred years
of history fell to Jew and the
students of her fall term Theater
class. '

Within the vast catalog, pro-
fessors Jew and Cumming un-
earthed letters concerning a bevy
of social and political issues
such as prohibition, women’s
suffrage, segregation and racism,
as well as simple matters oftown
concern and letters from those
who missed home.

“We, asjournalists, claim our
dedication to democracy,” Cum-
ming said. “And that’s what let-
ters to the editor are allsabout.”

In many cases, the editors of
Lexington newspapers printed
every letter they received which
enabled the research team to hear
the unfiltered voice ofthe people.
Such a fact, Cumming believes,

is a testament to his belief that
the whole history of democracy
is woven in the free press.

When it came time to adapt
the letters into a- working script,
a creative choice had to be made
whether to manipulate the letters
to tell a specific story or to pres-
ent them as independent entities.
Jew and her students solved the
problem by writing a script that
is, in many ways, a hybrid of
both. .

“Our script tried to maintain
the original intent of the letters,
but yet work with the letters cre-
atively so that we could create
some sense of scene work and
some sense of movement,” said

:Jew. What emerged was a col-
lection of independent sketches
tied together by the simple idea
of home.

In every stage of its develop-
ment the production of “Letters
to the Editor” has garnered inter-
est from the community.

“We have had so much sup-
port,” said Jew. “The Rockbridge
Historical Society has been very
supportive, the community has
been extremely supportive, [and
so has] the faculty. People are
very interested in this project.”

Cumming has also written
an academicrpaper on the expe-
rience, which he will present at
the University of South Carolina
this month. Additionally, he has
signed a deal with Manner Me-
dia in Buena Vista to publish a
book on the Lexington letters
to the editor, which he expects
will be available late this year or
early next year.

Short story inspires
students to create and
perform plays

Mindbending Productions presents three one-act plays in
“An Evening of Theatre ”

Bysage Um
STAFF WRITER

Mindbending
the student-run theater group on
campus, is putting together “An
Evening of Theatre” this week
starting Thursday, March 17,
featuring four plays of insanity,
love and passion. '

The evening is to showcase
three one-act plays written by
Mindbending Productions presi-
dent senior Dave Curran, open-
ing for the one-man play written
by vice president senior Johnny
Coyle.

The idea for the show initially
came from Coyle’s adaptation of
Nikolai Gogol’s short story, “Di-
ary ofa Madman,” which chron-
icles a man’s insanity through a
series ofjoumal entries. Based
on Coyle’s one-man show, Cur-
ran wrote three plays with similar
themes of madness, communica-
tion, and interpersonal relation-
ships: Medium and Matrix, 1 Am
You and Finding the Words.

Medium and Matrix, direct-
ed by junior Jeni Pritchett and
played by sophomores Jesse
Mozingo and. Sara Hardman,
follows a man and woman’s
desire to discover the meaning
of everything in the world. An
absurdist piece, quite like those
of Irish avant-garde playwright
Samuel Beckett, it delves into

Productions, ,_

the essence ofhumanity at an in-
tellectual level.

The second play, I Am You,
explores madness brought on
by man’s endless desire and in-
ability to become completely
satisﬁed. It is directed by junior
Thomas S. Meric Ill and features
senior Ellie Duvall and sopho-
mores Jay Stephens and George
Youmans. Finding the Words in-
vestigates man’s frustration with
the relationship between passion
and self-expression. Directed
by sophomore Mary Rodriguez
and played by senior Samantha
Copping and sophomore Drew
Martin, the play surveys one
man’s slightly delusional hope
to inspire Qthers without being
inspired himself.

Mindbending Productions is
an entirely student run group that
is able to put on shows that the
students really want to do.

“It is a way for students to
pursue their own works and
ideas without being part of the
departmental production," said
Curran. “Whatever the demand
is, we try to meet that. It’s about
the students and what they want
to do.”

Led by Curran and Coyle,
Mindbending Productions has
come a long way. Only two years

ago, the group was mostly inac-
tive until Curran and Coyle de-
cided to resurrect it.

“We did staged readings and
founded Wednesday Night Live,
the sketch comedy group, to give
more opportunities for students
to be involved and push them-
selves,” Curran said.

Wednesday Night Live is also
completely student-written and
student-acted.

More than 20 students are di-
rectly involved in the shows and
they have put on various shows
in the past like Ah, Wilderness!
and The Fantastics. With the
technical help from the theater
department, Mindbending Pro-
ductions allows students to use
what they have learned in class
and try to do it themselves.

“An Evening of Theatre” will
be performed for three nights
starting on Thursday, March 17,
at 7:30 p.m. at the Johnson The-
ater in Lenfest Hall.

Men’s lax opens strong, stumbles

Almost a month ago, W&L dominated, 18-4, against F errum, [beating the newly established Panthers lax team

By Doug Bealle
STAFF wmrrn

The Washington & Lee Men’s La-
crosse team got their 2011 season off
to a great start by beating the Ferrum
Panthers 18-4 on February 15. The win
gave Coach Gene McCabe his 100th ca-
reer victory, and his 46th at W&L.

The game was also the ﬁrst game
ever for the brand new Ferrum lacrosse
program. W&L assistant coach Nat St.
Laurent was previously hired as the head
lacrosse coach at Ferrum, and recruited
many of the players who were on the
ﬁeld for the Panthers.

The Generals jumped out to a 3-0
lead, but the Panthers answered back
with two quick goals. Another W&L
goal led to a 4-2 score at the end of one
quarter. Seconds into the second quar-
ter, the Panthers scored again, putting
the experienced Generals up by only
one goal on a team composed almost
entirely of ﬁrst-years.

Senior attackman Spence Daw said
that the team was expecting an easy vic-
tory when facing a brand new program,
but admitted that Ferrum was “more

. skilled ‘than any ﬁrst year program I
have ever seen, which can be attributed a

to coach St. Laurent’s solid recruiting
before he took the job at W&L this sea-
son.” .

Captain Gerard Savarese attributed
the early struggles to “ﬁrst game jitters”
and that it took’ about a quarter and a
half to settle in to their game plan, but
after the team got its offense and de-
fense going “the game went along much
smoother.”

Once the Generals overcame their

rough start, they began to play very well,
and rolled off 13 consecutive goals, a
run that went well into the fourth quar-
ter. In fact, the Panthers didn’t ﬁnd the
back of the net again until there was less
than eight minutes leﬁ in the game.

Washington & Lee was led in scor-
ing by junior attackman Scott Meehan,
who notched four goals. Sophomore
midﬁelder Cooper Brown tallied two
goals and one assist, while Daw added
one goal and two assists.

At the end of the day, it was a good

victory that the Generals can build on
moving forward. Savarese summed it
up with by saying, ,“Solid start, good
ﬁrst step, but deﬁnitely room for im-
provement.”

He of course added, “We were just
happy to get our coach his 100th win.”

A three-game losing streak for the Generals ends against Washington College with a strong performance by senior goalie

By Doug Bealle
STAFF wnmsn

The W&L Men’s Lacrosse team beat

"the Washington College Shoremen 5-

4 on Saturday behind a strong perfor-
mance in goal by senior goalie Jason
Lumpkin.

Lumpkin started the year off as a

- back-up to senior Ned Lundvall, but

was asked to step in as the starter af-
ter Lundvall broke his hand in a game
against Salisbury. Lumpkin had 10
saves against WAC, two of which came
in the last ﬁve minutes while protecting
a one-goal lead, including one while fac-
ing a two-man advantage for WAC due
to penalties by two Generals. .
Afterwards, Lumpkin said he was
“thankful to get the opportunity to play,

and had a really fun time out there.”-



Quickito thank those around him, he
added, “The defense played unbeliev-
able.” »

The Generals got production from‘

a variety of sources as ﬁve different
players scored the ﬁve Generals goals.
Junior attackman Sam Mott and sopho-
more attackman Mac Means scored the
ﬁrst two goals of the game in the ﬁrst 3
minutes of the second quarter.

After the Shoremen tied it up at
two apiece early in the third quarter,
the Generals rippedoff three goals in a
span of ten minutes. Senior midﬁelder
Drew Koeneman, senior midﬁelder
Drew Mancini, and sophomore attack-
man Jack Apgar scored during the span,
while sophomore attackamn Will Gar-

rett assisted on two of the goals.

The Shoremen scored two more goals
in the fourth quarter to cut their deﬁcit to
one, but Lumpkin and the defense held
tight and refused to let Washington Col-
lege tie it up. ’

Senior defenseman and captain JD
Englehart spoke to Lumpkin’s perfor-
mance, saying that “we have always had
confidence in him asa back up, and he
proved that yesterday by getting his ﬁrst
win as a starter.”

The win marks the second of the sea-
son for the Generals, and ends a tough
three-game losing streak, all three losses
coming against teams who made the
NCAA tournament last season.

The ﬁrst loss was at home on Febru-

ary 19th to Whittenberg, a 7-6 loss that
saw the visitors come back from a 6-3
deﬁcit with the ﬁnal four goals of the
game.

The Generals followed that up by‘

visiting the perennial powerhouse Salis-
bury on February 23rd and losing 7-
4. This was the game where Lundvall

i broke ‘his hand.

The Generals suffered another loss
due to injury in practice after the Salis-
bury game when senior midﬁelder and
captain Gerard Savarese tore his ACL.
The following Sunday, the Generals vis-
ited Denison, and fell 10-6.

The win on Saturday was the ﬁrst
step in getting back on the right track.
Englehart added that “although it wasn’t

pretty, we really just needed to put a
strong 60 minutes together and gut out
a tough win.”

The Generals were unable to get
back to back wins after they fell Frank-
lin & Marshall on Saturday, 7-6.

The team will try again on Tuesday
against Kenyon. The game will be in
Lexington at 7 p.m.

Chemistry on the courts gives men success

A 6-0 start, interrupted by a tough loss to Mary Washington, for men is tennis hints at a strong season for the team

By Alex Maragos
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee men’s ten-
nis team kept up its winning ways with
5-0 wins over ODAC opponents Emory
& Henry and Virginia Wesleyan Satur-
day at the Dtjchossois Tennis Center.

The Generals now hold a 6-0 season
record and are 4-0 in ODAC competi-
tion, enough to be ranked 29th nation-
ally.

“I think the biggest reason [for our
success] is our team chemistry. We’re a
very close group of guys that have been
playing with each other for a long time

U I’ IDATE:

Washington and Lee suffered its first team loss of the season as the Generals fell to

now. We know...how to best support
each individual on the team,” saidjunior
Mae Davis.

Sophomore Hayden White andjunior
Jeremy Becht played in the only two
singles matches against E&H. White

won his match 6-2, 6-0, and Becht took’

his 6-2, 6-3.

In doubles competition, Becht
matched up with junior Jonathan Gaff-

with junior Michael Freeman to shutout
E&H for an 8-0 victory. Davis and se-

, Ranked 25th nationally, the Generals had been riding a 5-game winning streak coming into Saturday's match. Mary Washington was only the second non-conference
opponent that W&L has faced so far this year. Against the-ODAC, the Generals are undefeated with a combined 36-1 record in singles and doubles competition.

' Though they are ranked higher than W&L, Mary Washington improves to a 4-6 record on the season as the Gener

nior Will Hall paired up to win 8-4.
“Will and l have great chemistry in
both style of play and the mental game.

" We tend to moderate each other’s emo- ' '

tions and the effects it has on our play,”
said Davis. _

Later that day against Virginia Wes-
leyan, Hall and Davis paired up again
for doubles to win 8-0, and Gaffney
and Becht followed suit by also shutting
out their opponent. Freeman and White
continued the pattern, taking their match
8-2.

“We...foeused on playing smart and
reducing stupid errors. We played much
better [than we did earlier] and won in
less than 30 minutes against a better

In‘ singles, White and Hall were
nearly ﬂawless as they took down their
opponents from Virginia Wesleyan 6-0,

Several of the teams the Generals
will be facing in the coming weeks are

0 THE RING-TUM PHI 0

The Generals fell a week
ago to Southern Virginia
and Lynchburg following a
sweep of conference-rival

Emory & Henry

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

  

Just as the weather begins to warm
up, the bats have gone cold for the W&L
baseball team.

Southern Virginia shut ‘the Generals
out last Wednesday by a score of 2-0 and
Lynchburg swept Saturday’s double-
header 5-0, 9-6.

W&L is now 4-6 overall, 2-2 in
ODAC play.

Coming off of an impressive double-
header sweep versus Emory & Henry
just three days prior, W&L was looking
forward to continuing the momentum

versus SVU at Cap’n Dick Smyth ‘Field .

on Wednesday. SVU senior pitcher Dar-
rell Brown had other ideas.

Sophomore ﬁrst baseman Josh Linn
singled in a run in the top of the ﬁrst for
SVU to put them ahead l-O. It was all
the lead Brown would need.

Brown went the distance for the
Knights, scattering a mere six hits, all

' singles, over nine innings. Five strike-

outs and six walks highlighted his com-
plete game shutout that gave him a 3-1
record for the year.

“Heithrew a lot of strikes and yet we
just weren’t putting good cuts onvthe
ball,” sophomore shortstop Jonathan
Stutts said.

“He would get ahead early with a
fastball and then lull us to sleep with
his off speed and we weren’t able to
adjust and wait on‘ the ball,” sophomore
outﬁelder Joe Scalzo said. “We need to
have the right mental approach going to
hit against pitchers like that.”

Jake Johnson went 3-4 at the plate

. in helping SVU to their ﬁrst win over

W&L since 2007. The 2-0 win also gave

 

the Knights their best start in program
history (8-1).

Senior starting pitcher Gregg Laswell
took the tough-luck loss for the Gener-
als, as he only allowed. two runs and
ﬁve hits amid his ﬁve innings of work.
Sophomores Alex Maragos and Stutts
each had two hits for the Generals, who
threatened, but couldn’t plate a run.

W&L looked to rebound on Saturday

with an afternoon ‘doubleheader versus.

Lynchburg, but found themselves in a
familiar situation. 3'

. Matt Morgan was the Hornets start-
ing pitcher in game one and much like
Brown for SVU, he shut down the Gen-
erals bats. He threw 8.] innings of shut-
out ball en route to a 5-0 LC victory.
Morgan only allowed two hits, walked
two, and struck out seven while improv-
ing to 3-0 on the season.

“Morgan did a good job of , using
counts to his advantage. He spotted up
well and was able to expand the strike
zone, “ Stutts said. “However, he was
more hittable than the box score indi-
cates. Lynchburg’s defense played.well
behind him and we just couldn’t seem to
get a ball to fall our___way.’’ ,  N ,_ _ W

A wild pitch and an RBI groundout
by LC sophomore Michael Kenah gave
the Hornets a 2-0 lead and they would
never look back, plating additional runs
in the third and fourth.

W&L junior Roger Strong got the
start for the Gennies but took the loss af-
ter surrendering ﬁve runs on seven hits
in 5.0 innings on the hill.

Once the ﬁnal out was recorded, the
Generals once again found themselves

 

  

looking at the scoreboard with a zero
staring back at them in the run column.
It would not be until the second inning
of the nightcap before the Generals ﬁ-
nally scored, ending a scoreless streak
that lasted 21 innings and stretched
across four games. A

“We are deﬁnitely a fastball hitting
team and opponents are starting to see
that and exploit our current inability to
hit off speed pitches,” Scalzo said of the
General’s current hitting‘ woes. “We just

need to be more consistent.”

The Generals almost pulled off the

‘comeback in the second game. of the

doubleheader, but ﬁve errors did them in
as W&L ultimately fell short by a score
of 9-6. I

W&L junior Jody Davis got the start
for the Generals but the Hornets had his
number and tagged him for six runs in
the ﬁrst three innings. They stretched
their lead to 8-2 after four innings, a

lead that would prove to be insurmount- .

able for the Generals. W&L clawed their
way back in the game thanks to a solo
home run by Scalzo in the bottom of the
fourth and a passed ball in the bottom of

 
 
  

W&L aﬁer they beat E&H 17-6 and 4-3
last Sunday to open up ODAC play. The
Generals will try to put the rough patch
behind them as they have a full slate of
games this upcoming week.

Stutts remained optimistic: “Our re-
cord so far doesn’t reﬂect the talent we
have this year - that’s what has made
these losses so frustrating. The bats will
come around. We just need to keep push-
ing and learning from each game.”

The Generals next face Stevenson
Tuesday in Lexington at 3:00 p.m.

the ﬁfth, The Generals would plate two_ , _ _

more in,the seventh inning to bring the
game to 8-6, but would get-no closer.

Stutts lamented the numerous ﬁeld-
ing errors: “We just handed them too
many extra runs.”

Sophomore Michael Del Buono led
LC at the plate, going 3-5 with two runs
scored and two RBIs. W&L senior‘An-
thony Cardona, juniorAlston James, and
sophomore Will Salley all ﬁnished 2-5.

Saturday. The Gennies trailed by three goals, losing to Salisbury with a score of 12-9.

The women’s lacrosse team started the
season with three big wins on the road fol-
lowed by a tough loss at home.

Over Washington Break, the team trav-
elled on the bus for more than 40 hours from
Virginia to Atlanta, to Tennessee, to Maryland
and ﬁnally home to Lexington. The Generals
racked up three wins on the road trip to be-
gin their Season 3-0, then suffered a loss to
Franklin and Marshall after returning home.

Senior leaders helped guide the Generals
(4-1) to their ﬁrst 2011 victory in a gripping
l8-l7 overtime win against the Mary Wash-
ington Eagles on February 20th in Freder-
icksburg, Va. Senior attacker Wilton Megar-
gel netted the game-winning goal in overtime
for a total of three goals. Senior midﬁelder
Emmy Matthews led with ﬁve goals, and
senior goalie Katharine Farrar had eleven
saves.

An easy match against Sewanee led the
team to their second win with a score of2l-

13. The Tigers could never catch up from the I

General’s l5-4 halftime lead. First-year Alex
Van Horn had four goals and Megargel had a
career-high of six goals.

Last week, W&L continued its streak at
Stevenson when Megargel hit the net with
eighteen seconds left in the game to win it
10-9. The Mustangs kept up with the"Gener-
als throughout the game, with help from at-
tacker Lisa Baker who had four goals. F arrar
led the Generals defense with twelve stops to
win the game.

in an interview with Lacrosse Magazine,
Coach'Brooke Diamond said ofthe victories:
“We have a laundry list of things to work
through, but positively it shows we can win
tight games. We didn’t panic. Again that goes

-back to our senior leadership.”

At the home opener at Watt Field on Sat-
urday, the No. 14 Generals couldn’t keep up
with the third-ranked Franklin and Marshall
team. The F&M Diplomats struck quickly,
scoring ﬁve goals in the ﬁrst ten minutes of
play. F&M juniors Katie Delaney had two
goals and Lauren Ehrhardt' had one goal and
an assist. '

The Generals responded with four un-
answered goals to end the ﬁrst half trailing
by one (5-4). But the Diplomats opened the
second half much like the ﬁrst, scoring three

times in the opening 3:08, to assume an 8-
4 lead with 26:52 remaining in the contest.
W&L rallied with goals by ﬁrst-year attack-
er Margaret Klein, junior attacker Maddie
McKaig, Mathews and sophomore midﬁelder
Ashley Barnes to bring the gap to one goal (9-
8). The Generals momentum wasn’t enough
to stop the aggressive F&M team. Although
they out show their opponent 22-19, W&L
suffered its ﬁrst loss ofthe season with a ﬁnal
of 1 1-8.

Senior captain Kate Donnelly called the
game a learning experience.

“We grew a lot as a team this game,”
she said. “We learned both that we can stay
with the number three team in the nation and
that we must rise in our competitive level of
play.”

The Generals faced their ﬁrst ODAC com-
petition on March 8th when they hosted Hol-
lins at 4:45 p.m. on Watt Field in Lexington.
The Gennies won, 21 - 0.

’ Residents lose everything, but remain unharmed
- Stockton Bullitt has eyewitness report

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR. EYEWITNESS

A student house at 232 Furrs Mill_

Road in Lexington burned down on
Sunday night, Mar. 20th. The house,
otherwise known as “Pole 2," housed
six Washington and Lee senior women.
No one was at the house when the ﬁre
started, and none were in the injured in
the ﬁre.

According to multiple sources, the
ﬁre started a little after 8 p.m. below
the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the house. Within min-
utes, the entire house was completely
engulfed in ﬂames. Flames extended t_o
twenty to thirty feet above the house.
The ﬂames could be seen from clearly
from the Route ll Bridge. The ﬂames
were even visible from campus.

The origin of the ﬁre is currently un-
known. However, the ﬂames appeared
very strong‘ and powerful. They were
so strong that they blew a power line
near to the house, cutting off power to
the rest of the pole houses. A student’s
car underneath the pole house was lost
to the ﬁre.

A neighbor to Pole 2, an eyewitness
to the ﬁre, did not notice the ﬁre until
approximately ten minutes after the ﬁre

started. After he and his roommates
evacuated their house, they called the
Lexington Fire Department, who had al-
ready been notiﬁed about the ﬁre.

Around 8:15, the Lexington and
Buena Vista Fire Department arrived at
the scene. The armada of ﬁre trucks then
spent the next hour putting out the rag-
ing ﬁre at the scene. After half an hour
of spraying water at the roaring ﬂames,
the ﬁre departments were ﬁnally able to
quell most of the ﬂames by around 8:45,
when the roof collapsed.

For most of the ﬁre’s duration, a
group of about ﬁfty W&L students gath-
ered on Furrs Mill Road to watch. Al-
though ambulances arrived quickly to
the scene, no students were injured by
the ﬁre or by any consequences of the
ﬁre. News sources were also quick on
the scene ﬁlming the situation at hand.

Students at the surrounding pole

’ W&L feels tremors from Japan’s quake  

Students, professors and alumni all aﬂected by the events halfway across the world; relief fund set up by organizations

By Emily Mosh
smrr WRITER

For more than a week, the world has

watched Japan ﬁght against the worst.

natural disaster in the country’s history.
Even Washington and Lee in Lexington,
Va. isn’t immune to its effects.

By now, everyone on campus likely
knows the approximate death toll after
the earthquake and tsunami hit the small
island country—8,000. Everyone has
heard about the ongoing nuclear crisis.
Everyone, however, might not know
about the personal effects the event has
had on members of the W&L commu-
nity. Not only do students and faculty
have familymembers and loved ones
in Japan, but two recent alumni are cur-
rently living and working there.

John Henzel, ‘I0, is in a teaching
program stationed in Japan. He is there
with his wife, Beth Valentine Henzel,
a member of the class of 20ll who
graduated early. Though he could not
be reached for an interview directly,
Henzel did post a note on his Facebook

I S ‘ page days after the earthquake struck. It

 

was his way of answering the hundreds

' of questions he knew he’d receive in the

upcoming weeks about his experience.

. “My experiences were relatively
mundane,” he wrote. “I never had to
evacuate or anything, and mostly just
had to put up with being without utili-
ties for a little while.”

In his note, Henzel said the hard-
est part now is that several of the local
stores are still closed and getting such
necessities asdrinking water is difﬁcult.
The school he’s been teaching at has
been particularly helpful, though, both
to the Henzels and to its students. It has
been serving as a shelter and has been
offering food and water to those who
need it.

The disaster has also affected stu-
dents and professors on campus.-

Sophomore Vera Higgs has family
in Japan. Her 97-year-old grandmother
lives in Tokyo, as do four of her aunts
and their families. One other aunt lives
even closer to the center of the disaster.

“I called my mother as soon as I
heard the news,” said Higgs. “[She]
was desperately trying to get a hold of
my family...l believe one of the worst
feelings in life is that of not knowing;
not only is it unbelievably frustrating,
but also overwhelmingly frightening.”

Higgs’s mother was able to make
contact with one of her sisters in Japan.
One of Higgs’s aunts was in a shelter,
and her grandmother’s house had caved
in. ‘Though shaken, they were all safe.

Mary Knighton, a visiting assistant

professor of Japanese, received news of
the earthquake and tsunami on Friday
morning through an email news alert.
Her husband, Scott Gold, is an archi-
tect who is currently running his ﬁrm’s
Japan ofﬁce in Tokyo. She was luckily
able to contact him by Skype that mom-
ing. '
“We looked together at the news
and terrifying images of the tsunami,”
she said. “Time and space just shrunk,
and the planet seemed very fragile and
small—my home here in Lexington si-
multaneously connected with my hus-
band at his worksite in Tokyo.”

Knighton made it to her 8 a.m. class,
though she said she was shaky the whole
day. She constantly checked for updates
and watched live streaming videos.

“Eerily enough, in disasters, the peo-
ple right there sometimes cannot see the
bigger picture that family and others are
seeing via television on the other side of
the country, even the world,” she said.

Knighton said she could see the de-
struction and devastation the tsunami
had left all over Japan on every channel

and website she visited, while her hus-
band and his colleagues had only their
small ofﬁce television set to receive in-
formation.

“By Saturday late afternoon, 1 was
thoroughly depressed and worried de-
spite having spoken to Scott,” Knighton
said. Her husband had assured herithat
he was ﬁne, facing only inconveniences.

Knighton said her husband has re-
ceived several emails from friends over-
seas concerned about the nuclear crisis
and asking him when he intended on
leaving.

“He had no intention or thought of
leaving at this stage,” she explained,
despite her husband noting that several
foreigners iniJapan had already started
ﬂeeing the area. “Panic can be danger-
ous and exacerbate an already crisis
situation.”

Knighton said she knew she had to
do something to distract herself from
worrying. She quickly contacted stu-
dent groups to ask for help in setting up
a relief fund for Tohoku.

“Within the hour, SAIL had started
organizing and even getting a poster
made,” she said, calling them “compas-
sionate about the cause and eager to be
part ofthe solution.” Soon, PAACE and
other organizations were helping too.

There is a table in Elrod Commons

with money going to the Japanese Red
Cross. Also, There will be a panel of

tory Department professors leading a
discussion about the crisis next Wednes-
day at noon.

Kickballfor
a cause

Philanthropy event
supports CASA

By Lizz Dye
STAFF wrmza

LIZZ DYE / staff writer

Ten teams from various organi-
zations participated in Theta’s
kickball tournament Saturday.

A Kappa Alpha Theta hosted their second
annual “Kicks for CASA” on Fuge Field
last Saturday. Ten teams participated with
participation from various fraternities and
sororities on campus.

CASA, which stands for “Court Ap-
pointed Special Advocates,” is a national
network of 1,000 program offices that are
recruiting, training and supporting volun-
teers to represent abused and neglected
children in the courtroom and other set-
tings.

Senior Lauren Bohdan is a certiﬁed
CASA. She said her experience has taught
her important lessons about both law and
social services.

“I feel like I understand the problems
with the foster care process and system
and can be useful in making it work more
effectively,” Bohdan said.

Emily Zankman, Theta’s philanthropy
chair, ran the event. According to Zank-
man, over $3000 were raised for CASA.

“It was the perfect day for a kickball
tournament, the competition was ﬁerce,
and the donations were plentiful. It was a
greatsuccess,” Zankman said.

The winning team, composed mostly of
Washington and Lee soccer players, won
a $100 gift certiﬁcate to Macado’s. Sweet
Things, Frank’s, and the Livery also do-
nated gift cards for rafﬁe prizes.

    

Registration redux: the new system’s big test "

Seniors begin registration this week while students wonder the new system will work

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

The new WebAdvisor registration
software will be tested this week as stu-
dents begin the first round of registra-
tion for the upcoming fall term.

Registration for seniors begins at
7:00 a.m. on Tuesday, March 22.

The new registration software that
will be used was implemented during
spring term registration of this year,
but now students will be registering for
four or ﬁve courses instead of just one.

Some students had a relatively
seamless spring term registration ex-
perience, but others were not so lucky.
Freshman Melissa Campion said she
thought spring term registration was
going to be easy. All she had to do was
register for her study abroad class in
Costa Rica.

But Campion said she had to try to
register on three different computers
before the new web registration pro-
gram would process her request.

Campion said she did not want to
have another stressful registration ex-
perience, so she attended last Friday’s
web registration information session,
led by University Registrar Scott Dit-
tman. A total of four students attended
the session.

Why the switch?

Dittman said that his office was re-

ceiving a lot of pressure from students
to switch to a system in which they
could pick their own course times.

The students’ requests and the fact
that the old web registration software
was 13 years old contributed to the
university’s decision to implement the
new registration software. The new
web registration software was studied
for about two and a half years, Ditt-
man said, and has been used at the law
school before.

Thanks to the new software, stu-
dents’ schedules will now be built
around speciﬁc sections of courses.
Gone are the days when the Registrar’s
Ofﬁce would sort students into sections
that would ﬁt their schedule—students
now have to decide on their own which
section of a course they want sign up
for.

The drop/add process will also
change. The new system makes it all
electronic. Students will no longer
need to run around with those blue
sheets of paper trying to get signatures.

Passwords have also been eliminat-
ed. Instead of having to get a password
from their adviser and keep it safe until
their registration window opens, stu-
dents will now receive an email from
their [adviser informing them that they
have been given permission to regis-
ter. Again, the paper component of this

 E

 

l\ Yb’li‘ll_..lil‘

process has been eliminated.
What could go wrong

One of the biggest problems that
Dittman sees with the new registration
process is that the software on WebAd-
visor does not provide all of the details
about the courses that it lists, such as
prerequisites required for the course.
In order to obtain full course informa-
tion, students need to go to the course
offerings section of the Registrar’s
website, making it even more impor-
tant that students plan for registration
in advance, Dittman said.

‘The new waiting list process, which
will actually begin after regular regis-
tration is complete, is another aspect
of registration that could potentially be
problematic, according to Dittman.

“We’re still kind of fooling with this
to ﬁnd the best way to do it,” said Dit-
tman.

Waiti-ng lists will now be ap-
proached on a student-by-student basis.
If a ‘spot in a course opens up, emails
will be sent out to one student at a time
offering them a chance to go online and
remove their name from a waiting list
and enroll in a course.

“That seat offer is. yours and yours
alone until the time runs out,” Dittman

. said.

     
 

  
 

H
r’

These emails will be time sensitive,
typically giving a student 24 hours to
take action and enroll in a class. But
the emails will only be sent out Monday
through Thursday, so students will not

have to worry about constantly check- _

ing their’ email over the weekends.
Dittman said that the new waiting list
process will stay open all summer long,
providing ample time for students to

change their mind about courses and/or

get off of waiting lists.

While the new registration software
offers beneﬁts to students, it also re-
quires that they take some time to get
acclimated to the system.

“It requires more work on our part,”
said current junior Frank Cullo as he
scrolled through the list of politics
courses available for him to take next
fall. Cullo said that he had already
tried to make a preferred course list
once, but the registration software gave
him nothing but error messages. He
had to wait a few days and try again.

WebAdvisor registration process, in-
cluding 'a schedule of registration
times, can be found on the Registrar’s

' These shoes ruIe...These shoes suck

W&L women are not creative when it comes to shoe fashion, but is fashion really the only reason to buy shoes?

By Ali Greenberg
C0 LU M N I ST

Girls like shoes,just like fat kids like
cake or Kobe Bryant likes hotel con-
cierges. (Allegedly.)

In fact, surveys show that Ameri-
_can women on average have 17 pairs of
shoes.

I personally own 13 pairs of TOMS
alone, but I did intern for them and am
a sucker for charity shopping. Well,
for shopping in general. And shoes. It
comes with being female middle class
and white.

So in my opinion, and this is an opin-
ions column after all, a shoe article has
been a long time coming. However, I
wasn’t sure how I wanted to approach
the topic until my deadline itself was
approaching, and I remembered a recent
Spanish class.

On a recent abnonnally warm spring
day, in between learning about la prim-
era y segunda republica, I was staring at
my feet overcome with the hazy feeling
of aftemoon sunshine and the chirping

’ of the birds far outside of DuPont’s as-

bestos riddled walls. (Allegedly.)

Soon I carried my gaze around the
classroom ﬂoor, and spotted the follow-
ing: Uggs, Cowboy Boots, Frye Boots,
Rainbows, Tory .

phenomenon in one of your classes,
chances are you have. Chances are you
are wearing one of those types of shoes

right now.

each type of shoe, I decided that I actu-
ally wanted to use the rest of this space
to talk about something that is actually,
well, important.

As mentioned

Burch’s. Clarks Wal-
labees, New Balanc-
es and Sperry’s.

Since it" wasn’t
raining, we were
missing Hunter’s and
Bean Boots, and giv-
en the calendar, Jack
Rogers would have
been about as aggres-
sive as the chick that
took off her pants at
Das Klub.

Honestly, thejokes write themselves.

here because every female in the class
was wearing one of the above varieties;
it was like a real life fun house where
every irony I have ever thought about
came true!

Maybe you have observed a similar

It is sometimes diﬁeult to remember how
lucky we are when our biggest issue is
which pair of overpriced ballet ﬂats go
better with our summer shift dress.

VI want to be clear that there is no
shame in this, not even in wearing Uggs,
which are really just bundles of warmth,
lambs and clouds enveloping your feet
with love. Shoes are a highly personal
choice and whatever you choose is ﬁne

by me.
But because it is boring to go through

previously, I own a
borderline obscene
amount of TOMS
shoes. However, I
did not become inter-
ested in these shoes
because they are
stylish, but because
they actually help the

world.
If you aren’t
familiar with the

TOMS model, their motto is very sim-
ple: One for One. This means that for
each pair of shoes a customer buys,
TOMS will donate a pair of shoes to a
child in need.

It is sometimes diﬁicult to remember
how lucky we are when our biggest is-
sue is which pair of overpriced ballet

ﬂats go better with our summer shift
dress. However, for much of the world,
whether or not they have shoes in gen-
eral is the real concern.

. If the world ‘were a village of 100
people, 40 of them would have no shoes
and in much of the third world, walking
is the primary mode of transportation,
often on unpaved and underdeveloped
streets.

And much like the dance ﬂoors on
Windfall, the water that covers these

' streets is infested with parasites. Being

barefoot in these conditions opens the
door for cuts, infection and disease.

I guess my point is, before you look
into your closet and think you have
nothing to wear, remember how privi-
leged you and your ugly shoes are.

New album does not live up to former glory

Jon Salm forgets that 2002 was nine years ago and reviews the album “Angles” by rock band The Strokes

ByJon Salm
COLUMNIST

Dear The Strokes,

Hey guys, how have you been? I’m
sure the ﬁve years you’ve spent since
First Impressions of Earth have served
you well. Albert, I really enjoyed your
two solo records. I couldn’t wait to hear
more of those jangly, simplistic pop
tunes. Julian, your own solo release left
something to be desired, but it was great
to ﬁnally hear that snarl again (even if
it sounded more like l980’s Miami than
tum-of-the-millennium Manhattan).

Nick, Nikolai, and Fabrizio - I know
you all spent the break working on the
guitar riff to the next “Last Nite,” the
bass line to the next “Reptillia,” and the
drum into to the next “The Way It Is.”

So, what the hell happened?

The Strokes were supposed to be
the saviors of Rock n’ Roll, for Christ’s
sake! You hit the stage with such ven-
geance, such swagger, such pure, un-
adulterated tenacity that you were im-
possible to ignore. You were the darlings
of the New York music scene. You were

the hippest of the hip, the coolest of the
cool. You were the kings of the lower
east side. Your songs were described as
a mix of“punky brevity and gnarly faux
simplicity.” But on

Is This It. However, this is clearly not
the case.

Angles is an unfocused mix ofvintage
garage rock and failed experimentation.

tunately, those are the only two tracks
on par with anything else in your back

catalog.
The rest of the album sounds like a
good band that has

your newest record,
Angles, it sounds like
you’re lost.

Angles is unlike
anything you have
done before, but is
unmistakably a re-
cord by The Strokes.
There are intricate-
ly linked guitars,
steady, pounding
bass lines, and Julian
Casablancas’ signa-
ture baritone. But at
the same time, this is not The Strokes
that I know.

After a mid-career misstep on your
last record, you promised a return to
form on Angles. “Rolling Stone” even
declared Angles your best record since
your slick and self-assured 2001 debut,

ignore.

The Strokes were supposed to be the
saviors of Rock n ’Roll, for Christis sake!
You hit the stage with such vengeance,
such swagger, such pure, unadulterated
tenacity that you were impossible to

When your return to your roots works, it
works well. Lead single “Under Cover
of Darkness” could ﬁt in seamlessly on
any ofyour releases, and “Life is Simple
in the Moonlight” has a surging chorus
that could ignite any crowd. Both are
sharp, catchy and charismatic. Unfor-

lost its way. “Gratis-
faction” has a saccha-
rine hook but quickly
falls into a repetitive
trap. The opening
guitar riff on “Me-
tabolism” echoes the
main riff of “Elec-
tricityscape,” one of
the weaker tracks on
First Impressions.
Don’t even get me
started on the Carib-
bean drumbeats of
“Games” or the failed Coldplay imita-
tion on “Call Me Back.” Were you even
trying?

On previous releases, your band op-
erated under a sort of advantageous dic-
tatorship under Casablancas’ leadership.
Despite this, you opted for a much more

democratic approach on Angles. Each
of you shares in the songwriting credits,
and it shows. The result is a distracted
album that tries to do too much. _

“I won’t just be a puppet on a string,”
Casablancas croons on “Under Cover of
Darkness,” but he appears to be wrong.
Angles is a record made by ﬁve individ-
uals with ﬁve distinct personalities and
approaches to songwriting. Such collab-
oration may work for some bands, but
for a group known for an iconic sound
and tightly coiled production, it does not
work here.

Angles_ is inherently ﬂawed. Al-
though it does have its moments, it is by

far your weakest offering. It does show .

a desire for growth and experimentation,
but remains a sad reminder of a band
that was once great.

Ra“ Sincerely,
Jon Salm

PatSmith explains the unnecessary necessities of a typical college male is vocabulary - complete with deﬁnitions

By Patrick Smith
c o L u M N I sr

After a conference sweep, a win over
a ranked opponent and countless bone-
less wings and tequila shots with the
baseball team, I decided to write my
ﬁrst article under the inﬂuence of alco-
hol. At least that’s what you all think...

Over February Break I had the pleas-
ant opportunity to frequent Atlanta for
.the second time in my life as a member
ofthe Generals’ baseball team. Many of

school actually read my articles. I don’t
even read my own articles, which is why
they suck. Finding out that all of these
mothers read the Phi was both exciting
and horrifying for me at the same time.
I was excited to see that I am not the
only one who laughs at my lamejokes. I
was horriﬁed to discover that a substan-
tial number of people know that I love
beer and am a closet Guido. True story;

I don ’t even read my own articles,_which is

why they suck.

my teammates’ parents, as well as mine,
were in attendance for this trip. The At-
lanta baseball trip is a great way to catch
up with the parental units and get some
free meals. I love pocketing my per
diem from the university.

While in Atlanta, I came to realize
from many of the mothers of the base-
ball team that people outside of this

my left ear is indeed pierced. ‘Twas a
game-time decision at the Jersey Shore.
Shit got real, and I was doing it live.
Knowing that such a wide demo-
graphic of individuals read what I have
to say, I thought I would put a bit more
thought into this one. In addition, know-
ing that so many mothers of W& L’s sons
read the Phi, I think it would be nice to

clue them in on some real shit.

What I would like to do is highlight
some of the key words apparent in the
average male’s vocabulary for today’s
standards. I have carefully picked ﬁve
words that men on this campus use far
too much, yet cannot refrain from using.
These words are vital to everyday com-
munication and have several different
meanings, depending on the context.

Let me start you off with a few ex-
amples:
“Dude...”
“Bro... Das Klub was so dank..”
“Damn, chill out, bro.”

If you were in any way able to de-
cipher the meanings of these phrases/
sentences: congratulations, you are not
a complete loser.

Without further ado, the ﬁve unnec-
essary necessities of a college male‘s
everyday vocabulary.

Dude:

Dude is a great word. In the afore-
mentioned phrase, “Dude. . .,” this could
mean several different things. For ex-

ample, this could be interpreted as,
“What the hell,” \“Check out this shit,”
“That chick is smokin’,” etc., etc.

Dude is an extremely flexible word.
That is perhaps the reason so many
males butcher it to death daily. It is a
fantastic conversation starter, conversa-
tion continuer, and conversation closer.
It is the triple threat of prose, ladies and
gentlemen.

Bro:

Bro is a word that has come to frui-
tion over the past couple ofyears. There
is a strong positive correlation between
saying the word bro and drinking beers.
One can imagine that at a sausage fest
this word is said quite often. Bro is a
great way to address a friend or acquain-
tancc.

Chill: Chill is a legitimate word.
This word encapsulates my lifestyle to
the nth degree. When someone or some-
thing is described as “chill,” than that
is something worth your time. For ex-
ample: Draco Malfoy : not chill. Mario
Kart 64 : Chill.

Damn: Damn is a word used to ex-
plain unfortunate situations. Student A
does poorly on a test: “damn..." Stu-
dent B sees Student A’s grade on that
test: “damn...” '

Dank: Dank can be used to describe
fortuitous situations. Hosting a great
party is something that is dank. Sweet
hair flowing out of the back of your lax
helmet is dank. Trying to fold a ﬁtted
sheet is not dank.

Freedom by force, not an option

John Paul Beall argues that America should not intervene and decide how a foreign government should govern itself

By John Paul Beall
COLUMNIST

A few days ago I was beset with the
question of whether or not America has
the right to impose republican govem-
ment on other countries. Does America
have the mandate to force choice upon
another nation?

The answer is a resounding no. While
in some cases intervention is justiﬁed
for various reasons, the overwhelming
majority of cases will not turn out as
planned, wasting America’s resources
and political capital, and only further
destabilizing the delicate societies in
which we intervene.

Where does this idea even origi-
nate? It is born from a national idea
called American Exceptionalism—a

kind of nationalism. This article is not
placing American Exceptionalism on
trial, as I am an Exceptionalist myself,
but complex phenomena have beneﬁts
and drawbacks. The resulting philoso-
phy is essentially a “mother knows best”

you that it is ugly, or that white socks

can impose freedom on anyone.

left, yet they are not the only perpetra-
tors. The resulting foreign policy is in-
herently hypocritical on multiple levels.
It is not America’s job to be the police-
man ofthe world.

Examine the following analogy. It
is not our job to choose what govern-

If your shirt does not ﬁt well and you
ask for someones help, that person can
help you go shopping for a new shirt and
help you remove it, but it is not anyone’s
job to dress people. Although ,with some
people, sometimes I wish it were.

Consider the French. They did not in-
tervene in our revolution until we asked
for help, and never did they impose upon
the thirteen colonies to construct an ab-
solute monarchy modeled on the French
government (and thank God, they did
not). Unless a country’s people ask for
assistance, it is nothing more than barg-
ing in; and often times when America
has barged in and toppled governments
it ﬁnds unsavory, it negotiated with an-
other unsavory government to be able to
get into this country in the ﬁrst place!
For every dictator we topple, we assist
another. Plus, there is something inher-

govemment and freedoms are not a one
size ﬁts all solution but cannot really be
true. The most important step in estab-
lishing a republic is investing popular
sovereignty in a country‘s people. As
long as they retain sovereignty over the
legislative process, they can literally
make the country whatever they want it
to be.

- This cuts both ways. If a country is
not ready for such a step, then the gov-
ernment will sink back into the abyss
of dictatorship, often times with more
strength than the last go-round, because
then it can possess the veneer of repub-
lican deliberation. Take Egypt, for ex-

ample. It was a puppet monarchy dur-

ing the time Great Britain occupied it.
After they relinquished control during
decolonization, the Western world as-
sisted the construction of a new Egyp-

tian govemment. After it was complete,
the military developed a powerful grip
on the country’s political system, and it
took ﬁfty years for the people to ﬁnally
rise up to cast off this organization. This
uprising was the populace deciding for
itselfthat it was ready to take its govem-
ment into its own hands~something it
was not ready to do during decoloniza-

_ tion. Americans see the bestowal ofour

political system as a gift, and indeed it
is, but it is a monumental gift that is ul-
timately the receivers’ to accept. There
are cases where people are so oppressed
and impoverished that they are unable to
revolt, and indeed it would be justiﬁed
to grant them assistance in some form.
but again, is it solely America’s burden
to help these people?

. America should not totally block it-
self out from foreign policy—that would
only be detrimental to America’s inter-
ests. Rather, America must cease mean-
ingless government toppling, because
it will almost always make conditions
in that country even worse than they
already are. Instead, let caution guide
American foreign policy. Intervention is
not always the answer.

Tennessee orchestra blings beloved musical to life

Two weeks ago, the Knoxville Jazz Orchestra performed the music from Sweeney Todd at Washington and Lee

By Holly Suthers
ARTS&L|FE EDITOR

The booming sounds of saxophones,
trombones and trumpets ﬁlled the con-
cert hall in Wilson Hall two weeks ago.
The Knoxville Jazz Orchestra performed
“Fleet Street: The Music of Sweeney
Todd” to a large audience. Led by com-
poser Terry Vosbein, the jazz orchestra
played two acts ﬁlled with memorable
music pieces from the musical.

The music of the play is emotional,
vehement and robust. The tone of each
piece captures the setting of the scene
and the mood of each character. Vos—
bein’s rendition ofthe music maintained

the same feelings and portrayed the
twisted and unusual plot ofthe play.

“Even though I hadn’t seen Sweeney
Todd, the music was both well-played
and well—written. l enjoyed the per-
formance and actually went home and
watched the musical afterward because
I wanted to know the story that went
with the music,” said senior Cameron
Dewing. V

The concert consisted of two acts
with a brief intermission between the
two. The Knoxville Jazz Orchestra had
a complete brass section, a percussion-

ist, pianist, bassist, and drummer. The
compilation of the diverse sections
united the music throughout the entire
performance.

Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber

' of Fleet Street was written by Stephen

Sondheim and performed for the ﬁrst
time in 1979. The musical is based on
the play under the same name and fol-
lows the tale of Benjamin Barker, also
known as Sweeny Todd, and his retum
to London. Todd returns l5 years af-
ter he was expelled from the city on
false charges. The plot follows the pro-

tagonist’s plan of revenge on the city’s
prominent judge whom forced him
to leave, raped his wife and kept his
daughter away from him.

“It lnade me feel like l was on Fleet
Street. It really conveyed a message.”
said junior Connor Danielowski.

Vosbein is a professor of music
at Washington and Lee and an active
composer. He and the Knoxville Jazz
Orchestra released l)l‘()gl'C.S'.\‘ll’€ Jazz in
2009. It has been praised as "a masterful
and rewarding tribute" and continlles to
receive high marks since its release. The

CD is a tribute to formerjazz bandleader
Stan Kenton, a model and inspiration for
Vosbein.

W&L will host several upcoming
concerts in the future. For a schedule

The Washington and Lee men’s ten-

win Friday aftemoon against Hampden-

Following an easy 9-0 away victory
over Randolph College on Tuesday af-

The match was a clash between the

Though W&L has hit a rough patch in

W&L had the upper hand against

Best basketball blockbusters

In honor of March Madness, an AP writer lists her favorite basketball movies...but where s “Love and Basketball”?

By Christy Lemire
AP MOVIE crmrc
LOS ANGELES (AP) — There are

a lot of basketball movies in the world, _

and most of them are pretty terrible.
They’re corny or too feel-good, they
feature awkward celebrity cameos or
they try to wedge in an uncomfortable
romance. But some of them get the sport
— and the people who play it — just
right.

With March Madness upon us, these
are ﬁve of my favorite basketball mov-
ies. Your bracket will probably look dif-
ferent. You will notice the omission of
“Hoosiers,” which is not an oversight.
Yes, it’s the standard for basketball
ﬁlms, but it’s too obvious, and has long
since felt like a manipulative underdog
cliche. Gene Hackman is always great,
but sorry, the slow clap doesn’t play
here; I cringe just thinking about it.

the highs and lows of Arthur Agee and
William Gates over about five years, en-
courages us to root for them by depicting
them exactly as they are, lets us get to
know their families, their playgrounds,
their neighborhoods. lt’s both inspiring
and heartbreaking without trying too
hard to be either, and it’s far more en-
thralling in its realistic twists than any
scripted melodrama. Not just one of the
best basketball ﬁlms ever, but one ofthe
best documentaries ever.

ics great Bob Cousy as the university’s
athletic director (who likes to shoot

A “The Basketball Diaries” (1995):
Leonardo DiCaprio is electrifying as
Jim Carroll, the late New York poet
and musician who chronicled his teen-
age descent into heroin addiction in his
memoir of the same name. Growing up
in Manhattan, Carroll played basketball
for his elite Catholic high school and
dreamed of athletic stardom. Instead,
he would follow a dangerous path of
sex and drugs, artistic inspiration and
self-destruction. (The ﬁlm moves the
time period from the 1960s to the pres-
ent.) This early DiCaprio performance,
along with his Oscar-nominated work in
“What’s Eating Gilbert Grape,” offer an
exciting glimpse at the fearless actor he
would become.

height of his “Family Ties” and “Back
to the Future” fame, Fox came out with
this comedy about a scrawny player on
a struggling high school basketball team
who discovers he’s a werewolf. It’s as
high-concept as you can get. Turning
into a werewolf turns him into a mon-
ster both on and off the court — and yes,
“Teen Wolf” turns into a very tradition-
ally ‘80s-style cautionary tale about the
perils of instant popularity. But there’s
something nostalgically comforting
about that, and Fox, with his endear-
ing sense of self-deprecation and natu-
ral comic timing, somehow makes it all
work better than it should.

After three straight wins, baseball is 9-8 on the season led

By Stephen Peck
5 TA F F W R IT E R
.,,,F,.  _ a  ,, 

Just ﬁve days ago, the Washington and
Lee baseball team found themselves at 6-8
after dropping both games of a doubleheader
to Southern Virginia University by scores of
l I-9 and 7-4. ‘

They now stand at 9-8 and above .500 for
the ﬁrst time since March 1, after rattling off
three straight wins thanks to three dazzling

' pitching performances: 8-3 and 5-0 wins over

Guilford and another 5-0 win versus Tufts.

The Generals welcomed the Knights of
SVU to Cap’n Dick Smyth Field on Wednes-
day and hoped to keep the momentum rolling
from their demolition of Roanoke the prior
Saturday. SVU had other ideas.

SVU, enjoying one of their best starts in
school history at l0-2,jumped on W&L early
in game one, tagging freshman pitcher Jake
Rudolph for two quick runs in the ﬁrst. W&L
would answer in the bottom of the frame with
three runs of its own, and the slugfest was on.

SVU’s Andrew Snider went deep in the
third to tie the game at three, and the Knights
wouldn’t stop there. They added two in the
fourth and three in the ﬁfth and extended their
lead to 8-3. The Generals clawed their way
back, thanks to a two-run bomb by sopho-
more ﬁrst baseman Alex Maragos and forced
extra innings when sophomore outﬁelder Joe
Scalzo tied the game at eight with a bases
clearing, three-run double. The late inning
heroics eventually ran out for the Generals, as

‘ they fell by a ﬁnal score of 1 1-9.

Snider had a career day for the Knights,
going 5-6 with two RBIs and four runs scored
as SVU continued the Generals out-of-con-
ference woes.

, Sophomore shortstop Jonathan Stutts says
there is a method behind the apparent non-
ODAC struggles.

“The true measure of the team should be
seen in our conference record,” he said. “We
don’t play enough games to earn an at-large
bid to the NCAAS, so we need to win the
ODAC and those are the games we get more
hyped up for.”

in game two, SVU had similar success,
this time against W&L’s ace, junior pitcher
Roger Strong. Strong was knocked out of the

/\
t 5

l 

  

game after giving up ﬁve runs in only l.l in-
nings of work, although no runs were earned.

' Freshman pitcher Britt Dalton picked up
the win for SVU, allowing only two runs and
ﬁve hits over six innings.

Stutts led all W&L hitters on the day,
going 4-9 with three doubles, a triple, three
RBIs, and four runs. Maragos ﬁnished both
games with three hits in six at bats with four
RBls.

To ﬁnd a measure of consistency, Strong
said they “need to ﬁnd our rhythm pitching
and ﬁelding." They did just that over the
weekend.

—After dropping ﬁve of their last seven
games, the Gennies were determined to right
the ship when they traveled to Guilford for
an ODAC doubleheader on Saturday. A bit of
redemption from Strong in game one wasjust
the spark W&L would need to go on a win-
ning streak of their own.

Strong scattered nine hits and only two
runs while striking out four in his 6.1 innings
of work. Despite his efforts, W&L still found
themselves down 2-] going into the bottom
of the eighth. Stutts’s double to lead off the
inning sent Guilford starter Zach Daw, who
was having a brilliant outing of his own, to
the showers and the Quakers turned to the
bullpen. It would be the worst mistake they
made all day.

The Generals batted around the order and
exploded for seven runs in the inning before
Maragos showed some mercy and popped out
to end the onslaught. A sacriﬁce fly was all
the offense Guilford could muster in the top
ofthe ninth, bringing the ﬁnal score to 8-3.

Strong seemed conﬁdent that this was
a big step to regaining his dominant 2010
form. “Until Saturday I was deﬁnitely pitch-
ing much less than my best,” he said. “Coach
Smith has been working with me the last
week to get my, mechanics back in order,
which likely was the reason why I pitched
better this last game.”

Senior pitcher Gregg Laswell outdid the
efforts of Strong in game two, as he twirled
a complete game shutout en route to a 5-0
W&L win. His masterful performance in-

  

by strong pitching

    

cluded seven strikeouts amid four hits, all of
which were singles.

“He simply overpowered every hitter four
times,” Stutts said of Laswell’s dominance.
“He used the same approach against every
individual guy.”

A double by Maragos in the top of the
ﬁrst that drove in senior outﬁelder Anthony
Cardona was all the scoring Laswell would

need. They would eventually bang out 15 hits"

in total though, with sophomore third base-
man Mike Savas going 3-4 with an RBI to
lead the way. ‘I

The way the season has gone for the
Generals, one wouldn”t be wrong to expect
the worst when W&L faced Tufts at home
on Sunday afternoon. W&L’s shoddy out of
conference record, coupled with Tufts being
ranked 17th in the nation and the fact that
W&L had yet to win three games in a row
this year, added up to impending disaster.
Jody Davis was having none ofthat.

— The junior right-hander got the start for
the Generals and did his best Gregg Laswell
impersonation. He went the distance, shutting
out the Jumbos and striking out ﬁve in lead-
ing the Generals to the 5-0 upset win.

“He threw out of his mind,” Stutts said of
Davis.

Much like the game before, a run by Car-
dona in the ﬁrst off of a Stutts sacriﬁce ﬁy
would be all the offense Davis needed to
work with. Cardona ﬁnished 3-5 with two
runs scored.

‘After an up and down season, the Generals

Secrets 
exposed

Post-Secret creator speaks
at W&L ,

By Jayna Johns
SPORTS EDITOR

Frank Warren, the founder ofthe weekly blog Post-
Secret.com and the author of ﬁve best-selling books,
shared his perspectives on life and secrets, and what he
has learned about the two, during his presentation in
Stackhouse Theater last Tuesday.

“I like how [the PostSecret project] demonstrates
the transformative power secrets have over us, and the
power that we also have over them,” Warren said dur-
ing an interview before his presentation.

The idea behind the project is simple: a person anon-
ymously writes down his or her secret, often along with
a related picture, and sends it to Warren. He reads every
card sent to him and, along with a team of other people,
selects 20 every week to post online and hundreds more
to put into books.

Warren said the idea came ‘out of his personal his-
tory. He grew up in a family that always kept secrets,
secrets that eventually drove his family apart. Warren
said his father and brother have not spoken to his moth-
er in years.

As an adult, Warren worked for Hopeline, an or-
ganization that helps with suicide prevention. While
there, he said he noticed that every person he met had a
rich interior life: inside jokes, taboo thoughts, hopeful
wishes. These experiences shaped him and spiked his
interest in the thoughts, emotions and experiences of
other people.

Warren said he’s always been fascinated by secrets,
but in 2004 he had a “crazy idea.”

He began by handing out 3,000 one-sided postcards
on the streets of Washington DC with his address al-
ready written "on them, encouraging people to write
their secrets down and mail them to him.

Warren said the most common response he got was
“I don’t have any secrets.” The results he gets from the
project suggest otherwise.

For the ﬁrst three months, the secrets slowly trickled
in, almost completely from the DC area. But when he
launched the online blog, the project’s popularity took
off. Warren estimates that he receives over 1,000 se-
crets every week from around the world.

“It just shows that we all have secrets...There’s not

ren said in an interview. “It was shocking to really un-
derstand how large the project was getting, the reach it
was getting.”

Warren said that while the project started as more
of a “creative prank,” it became a “joumey to discover
parts ofmy own life. I’ve been hiding from secrets, I’ve
been keeping [them] from myself.”

According to Warren, the most common secret is “I
pee in the shower.” '

The second most common is a little deeper: “I have
so many secrets; all I want is to ﬁnd that one person to
share them allwith.”

According to Warren, people are looking for that
one other person they can be themselves around.

Warren said he really saw the power of a secret in an
e-mail he received commenting on other secrets. The
original secret showed a broken door, and read that the
person’s mother had broken the door so she could get
into his room to continue beating him. Following that
secret, Warren said that pictures of broken doors, bro-
ken for the same reason, came ﬂooding in.

“Seeing all those pictures of broken doors; it didn’t
depress me,” the e-mail said. “It made me feel con-
nected.”

The e-mailer continued to say that he had blocked
out that part of his childhood, refusing to acknowledge
it.

With this information, Warren had an epiphany. “For
the ﬁrst time I realized there are two kinds of secrets:
the secrets we keep from others, and the secrets we
keep from ourselves.” '

“We keep secrets, but secrets also keep us,” he said.
“They could be undermining our relationships with
other people.”

One result of the project is the inside-look into the
world’s population. Warren said that most people, es-
pecially reporters, ask if many secrets are about crimes
that people have committed, believing that to be the
world’s biggest problem. But Warren said very few

many secrets are about loneliness, self-harm, eating dis-
orders and suicide. The project has become a window
into the darkest places of humanity’s heart, a way of
understanding the most universal parts of our lives.

Warren emphasized to Tuesday’s audience, just as
he does to all of his audiences, the importance of em-
bracing the good and bad in life equally and everything
that can be learned from those moments.

“If you can go through the light and the dark [of
life], at the end, you’ll have a story, one of healing and
redemption?’ ‘

“(President-elect) Scott McClintock sent

to individually recruit students we thought
would be good for thejob,” he said.

Centorino said the turnout seemed to be
skewed toward the younger students, but
noted that this was the norm for most elec-
tions. He said that there are typically around
four students running for thejunior and senior
classes and more than 10 for the freshman and

sophomore elections.

No incumbents are running for the two se-
nior, two junior and two sophomore represen-
tative spots. The SJC will have no incumbent
runners for the junior representative spot.

This is the second round of elections for

Last week, students elected SJC and EC of-

Scott McClintock beat out Austin Branstet-

had served as class representatives on the EC
since their sophomore years. McClintock also
served as secretary this past year.

Branstetter said he will not run for one of

Student leaders reﬂect on the low percentage of women in W&L student government

Bysage Um
STAFF WRITER

With EC and SJC elections
approaching, the lack of women
in student government has been
thrown into focus.

According to John Ehrhardt,
Chair of the Voting Regulations
Board, there have been at most two
undergraduate women serving on
the EC each year, out of 13 mem-
bers, for the last few years. The
SJC has not had any female repre-
sentatives for the last three years.

Current class of 2013 repre-
sentative Jack Apgar offered one
possible explanation for the lack
of women, “Women may be more
hesitant in running for a position
in an already male—dominated or-
ganization,” Apgar said.

Head Recruitment Counselor
and Panhellenic Council Member
Alexandra Frazier said she thinks
the relationship between women
and student government is a “vi-
cious cycle.”

“There’s no women on the
committees, which makes it difﬁ-
cult for other women to consider
running, and when they don’t run,
there’s no women on the commit-
tees,” Frazier said.

Sophomore Rachel Warrick is
running for class of 2013 repre-
sentative. She said there is a need
for an example of female leader-
ship on the EC and the SJC. By
having someone on the committee
actively representing the Washing-
ton and Lee women, other women
could be motivated to run for po-
sitions in the future, Warrick said.

Justice Mary Elizabeth Bush is
running for junior justice on the
SJC. She said it is strange to see
women under-represented in stu-
dent government because women
hold leadership positions in many
other organizations.

“I have plenty of friends who
have leadership positions on ser-
vice organizations and Mock Con-
vention,” Bush said, “Spreading
the word about the elections is
important. I'think the girls need
more encouragement to consider
running for a position.”

Jackie Smith, the current EC
class of 2011 representative and
the only undergraduate woman on
the EC, said she agrees with Bush
on the need for the extra encour-
agement for women.

“While running for a position
on the EC or the SJC is a personal
choice, I think the women need the
extra push," Smith said. '

Smith said she was pleased
with the interest from women at
the recent information session.

“The desire is there and it was
great to see so many women show-
ing interest,” Smith said. “Its al-
ways difﬁcult to put yourself out
there, especially when it’s not the
popular thing to do.”

Smith said her term on the EC
has been extremely rewarding.
“While the men on the EC are
perfectly capable of performing
their duties, I thought it was very
important to have a woman’s per-
spective.”

She is not the only person who
acknowledges the importance of
having women on these commit-
tees. Apgar said the committee
would really beneﬁt from having
more women. .

Sophomore representative
Steele Burrow also said, “The
EC’s role in student governance is
signiﬁcant and having a woman’s
different perspective would be

extremely helpful in making deci-
sions.”

Although she found the lack
of women in government surpris-
ing, Bush said it’s important that
women not have an unfair advan-
tage just because they are women.

“I want people to vote for me
not just because I’m a girl, but be-
cause I’m just as capable and de-
serving ofthe position as anyone,”

, said Bush.

All candidates will make short
speeches at a candidate forum on
Monday night and the voting will
occur on Sakai between 8 am and
5 pm, during which students cast
two votes for EC candidates and
one vote for SJC candidates. If
needed, a runoff will occur on Fri-
day with a third and ﬁnal runoffon
Monday.

Students bring water to Bolivia  

Washington and Lee and Virginia Military Institute students work togethe

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

Students and professors from Wash-
ington and Lee and the Virginia Military
Institute will be travelling to the small
village of Pampoyo, Bolivia, this sum-
mer to help bring clean water to the 70
families in the village.

Junior Dana Frederick met Major
Tim Moore at a lecture last term about
the recent natural disaster in ‘Haiti.
Moore, assistant professor of civil en-
gineering at VMI, told Fredericks about
an organization called Engineers With-
out Borders that works to improve the
health and quality of life of the people
in underprivileged areas of the world
through the construction of engineering
projects. _

According to the Engineers Without
Borders website, the projects that EWB
groups plan and build provide “necessi-
ties such as clean water, power, sanita-
tion’ and education.” Moore is the ‘ad-
viser for the recently established VMI
chapter of Engineers Without Borders,
and he encouraged Dana to get involved.

Fredericks is now the president ofthe
W&L EWB group, which works in col-
laboration with the VMI EWB chapter.
She said that she is excited about EWB
because the group’s work is “beneﬁcial
to both the people ofBolivia and the stu-
dents.”

According to a 2008 report from the
World Health Organization, 3.575 mil-
lion people die every year from water-
related diseases. Clean water is also

needed to irrigate crops.

Crop irrigation is a primary concern
for the people of Pampoyo and is the
focus of the VMI and W&L students’
efforts.

The river where the residents of Pam-
poyo get water to irrigate their farmland
has been contaminated by runoff from
old mines located upstream. The stu-
dents, in collaboration with the Blue
Ridge professional chapter of EWB, are
working to design a catchment/pipeline
system that will capture the water from
the river upstream from the mines, and
then divert this clean water through

pipes to the crop ﬁelds of the farmers of A

Pampoyo.

Carrie Wortham, a junior biology
major and president of the VMI EWB
chapter, said that this irrigation proj-
ect could have great and lasting effects
upon the village of Pampoyo.

“A remote, isolated village—you’re
not going to ﬁnd much opportunity
there. So what we’re doing will hope-
ﬁilly encourage the younger generations
to stick around,” she said.

Wortham said the group hopes the
catchment and irrigation system that
they are building will increase/the
amount of arable land available to ,,Pam—
poyan farmers by 400 percent. 

Fredericks said that this increase in
farmland could allow the people of the
village to grow enough food to sustain
themselves and have some cash crops
left over. She said that a major concern
for the area is the lack of work avail-

able—that younger generations are
moving away from Pampoyo -to seek
work in the nearby city of La Paz. The
increased availability of farmland could
help ensure the longevity of the village
by encouraging its younger members to
stay put.

Along with the difficulties of plan-

ning the catchment and irrigation proj-

ecf for Pampoyo,’ the groups must also
fundraise in order to pay for the tools
and materials that they will need and for
their travel costs. The EWB groups plan
to send two ‘waves of students, profes-
sors and professional engineers from
the Blue Ridge EWB chapter to Bolivia
this summer to work on the catchment
system.

The students must ﬁnd a way to raise
$30,000 before they can leave the coun-
try and break ground on this project.

Another challenge that the chapter
and group are currently facing is recruit-
ment. “We’re working on getting under-
classmen involved,” said Matt Brock,
vice president of VMI EWB chapter. As
of now, the VMI chapter is all juniors
and two sophomores.

The W&L group has generated a
slightly greater" interest amongst young-
er students, as four current sophomores
and four current ﬁrst-year students
showed up to the inaugural meeting of
the group that was held several weeks
ago. All of the students at this ﬁrst
meeting listed some form of physics or
engineering as one of their majors.

Professor Jonathan Erickson, assis-
tant professor of physics and engineer-
ing at W&L and adviser for the W&L
EWB group, said that while it was great
to see such a good turnout of engineers,
he hopes that students with interests
other than engineering will get involved
with the group as well.

“In some ways it’s kind of unfortu-
nate that it has ‘engineers’ in the title.
 Getting the message out that this is a
club not just for engineers but for any-
body who’s interested in these types of
community-service style projects, with
a purview especially towards the inter-
national developing world, that’s just a
challenge, I think, inherent with name
that comes with [the club].”

Those involved with EWB are eager
to see the both chapter and group grow
in terms of size and the range of interests
of their members. In early April, Fred-
ericks will be holding an information
session in which she will present EWB
and the Pampoyo project to some of the
students at W&L interested in poverty
studies.

“We want the poverty people in-
volved big time too,” said Fredericks.

In addtion to benefts the Pampoyo
project will bring to the people of this
small Bolivian village, the impact ofthe
project is already being felt right here in
Lexington.

Moore said he believes the collabora-
tion that has begun to occur between the
VMI EWB chapter and the W&L group

r on engineering project

has the potential to improve the relations
between the two campuses.

“lt bridges gaps that have existed for
years between VMI and W&L,” said
Moore. Members of the chapter and the
group say said that there have been no
problems, other than scheduling con-
ﬁicts, when it comes to the inter-campus

' collaboration. Brock said he thinks it’s

great that W&L students are getting in-
volved with the Pampoyo project and
that he appreciates the different way of
thinking that W&L students have.

“They have a different outlook on
things and that’s really nice. And an-
other thing, it’s just cool to be. able to
talk with somebody that’s not wearing
one of these things, you know,” Brock
said as he pointed at the VMI patch on
his jacket. “It’s a little outside contact
for once.”

Students interested in getting in-
volved with the W&L Engineers With-
out Borders group should email Dana

(I

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

You know those Sundays when you
wake and remind yourself that you nev-
er ever want to drink ever again?

Well, last Sunday. I had a bad one
of those. I woke up from a sleep, but I
didn’t really feel like I had slept at all.
Lifting myself out of bed and walking
over to the bathroom was a chore rare-
ly rivaled in difﬁculty. As I soothingly
massaged my head and stomach simul-
taneously, -I had a nice little conversa-
tion with myself about never drinking
again.

Then it came to me, why not force
myself not to drink again and then. write
a column about it? That way I could
force myself to actually abstain from
drinking for a week, and I could also
provide at least some quality commen-
tary on the age old Washington and Lee
perception that “you can’t have fun at
parties if you aren’t drinking.”

After my hangover died down, this
idea started to take the fruition that
most ideas take on Sundays. See, if you
aren’t'telling yourself“I’m screwed, I’m
screwed, I’m screwed” on Sunday, then
most likely you aren’t worrying about a
test or an essay due the next day. And
most of the time, Sunday actually turns
into the day of hope (again, this is after
the hangover has died down). I person-
ally spent most of Sunday imagining
how productive and wonderful my next
week would be without alcohol.

I was going to start working ahead
more in school. I was going to start call-
ing my family and ask them about how
they were doing more. I was going to hit
the gym more. And the best part about
this upcoming week was that I was now
going to be. much richer thanks to my

lack of beer runs.

Overall, my ﬁrst day without alcohol
was fantastic. That is, until the Pole 2
ﬁre, which is when I seized upon the
opportunity to exploit the situation
and report on ru-

the Vanderbilt basketball team of beer
pong (always hyped but never make it
past the ﬁrst round)_, that doesn’t mean
that I don’t thoroughly enjoy playing
beer pong. Sadly, I had to pass up the

mors. In my sober
state, I forgot to
RESPECT JOUR-
NALISM and re-
fused the chance
to interview cry-
ing girls who had
just lost everything
they owned within
an hour about the
minute details of
the tragedy they
had just experi-
enced. Maybe I did need alcohol...
Anyway, Monday and Tuesday flew
by with a breeze. Really, refusing the
temptation to casually drink helped the
most on these two days. I did catch up
on work, and I started to follow the news
much more closely. I attended more of
the school’s offered lectures and sym-
posiums. I started saying “Hmmm....
indeed” much more often. Basically, I
attributed my new temperance with a
new academic enlightenment.
Wednesday was the ﬁrst really difﬁ-
cult day of the week for me. After din-
ner, I was sitting around with friends,
and one of them raised his hand only to
follow throw like he was shooting a free
throw in basketball. In modern vernacu-
lar, this movement has two meanings: I)
swish and 2) beer pong. Since we were
sitting in couches and this guy wasn’t
holding a basketball, everyone took it to
mean beer pong. Now,just because I am

letter,   totheedilzor

I am writing to express my frustration with the recent article published by the
The Ring-tum Phi about the ﬁre at Pole 2. I am embarrassed by the unprofessional-

ism displayed by our s"chooI’s only newspaper.

In the first paragraph alone there are TWO FACT ERRORS, not to mention a
grammatical error. The least the Phi editors could have done was proofread the

article, even if they chose to completely disregard reporting the facts.

The correct address is 207 Furrs Mill Road, not 232 Furrs Mill as the article
last week stated.’ Second, the article said there was no one in the house when the
ﬁre started. This is also false. There were three people in the house when the ﬁre
started. Fortunately, they were all able to escape the house safely without injury.

In addition to the factual errors in ﬁrst paragraph, the article also claimed power
to the rest of the pole houses was cut off. This again is pure rumor, as I live at Pole '

3 and we never lost power.

The Phi exploited the situation at the mercy of the six girls who lived at Pole 2. It
put the ﬁre on the front page to attract other student’s attention with no regard to get-
ting the story right. If the Phi thought it was providing a valuable service to the rest
of the community, it failed. If the Phi wanted to inform the rest of the community"
about the ﬁre, it should have taken the time to accurately report the facts, instead of

forwarding rumors.

I understand the Phi’s desire to try and break the story, but the blatant disrespect
shown by publishing false rumors is an embarrassment to professional journalism.

Now more than ever it is important for newspapers to be trustworthy sources of
news. As the public continues to look to the Intemet for its news, newspapers need
to avoid the trap of sacriﬁcing fact for immediacy. Newspapers and other legitimate
news organizations will have no future if they stoop to the level of blogs and Twitter.

This is a prime example of why the American public is turning to Twitter and '
blogs for its news instead of reading newspapers. If the public can’t trust a news-
paper to be more reliable than social networking sites, they have no reason to read

the paper.

So, as a student reader, I ask the Ring-tum Phi to get the facts right before the
next time it publishes an article, especially one as delicate as tragic ﬁre at student

housing.

magical opportunity and go back to
work.

Later that night, I was at my girl-
friends house doing everything I could
do to forget that tonight was usually a
party night. However, fate had other
ideas when Southern Comfort; decided
to throw a party at that very ‘house. I
sulked. I pouted. I tried to distract my-
self. But nothing worked, and yet, I still
didn’t leave, but that’s mostly because
I’m whipped. After Wednesday, I was
ﬁrmly under the assumption that no one
at W&L can have fun at parties without
the help of alcohol.

Thursday was a nice bounce back day
because people rarely drink on Thurs-
days. I would’ve gone to see Tron in
the Commons, just so I could complete
my on campus activities checklist. But,
I have seen that movie before, and even
Da.ft Punk couldn’t save such a terrible
movie from being the most unwatchable

W

fﬁiir

sci-ﬁ movie since Battleﬁeld Earth.

Friday was the beginning of the
gauntlet. How was I going to be able
to get through Fancy Dress weekend
without alcohol? Not only can I not
dance whatsoever, but I deﬁnitely can-
not dance without the inebriated false
bravado that accompanies most of my
dancing. I was terriﬁed for my date.

I ﬁnally completed my on campus
activities checklist by visiting the senior
art show on Friday. With all due respect
to the Japan symposium, the senior art
show was by far the highlight of my

journey into on campus academic ex-

ploits. If you haven’t checked out the
fridge photographs or the painted train
stations and window reﬁections, you are
missing something quality that our cam-
pus has to offer.

On Saturday, once I ﬁnished my din-
ner and soberly survived the pre-dance
cocktail party, I made it to the dance.
Despite being able to complete all ofmy
sentences, I still got into the obligatory
huge ﬁght with my date and still had to
beg forgiveness for all the stupid trans-
gressions I made that initiated the ﬁght
in the ﬁrst place. I guess alcohol isn’t
responsible for everything.

Once we made up however, my
date and I had a fantastic time at Fancy
Dress. The ambiance was wonderful and
the band on the main dance ﬁoor was
great. I was lucky enough to have a date
that wasn’t too drunk to judge my ter-
rible dancing and also had enough ofa
sense ofa humor to simply laugh at my
futile attempts at rhythm.

aren’t alcoholics and while we make
some mistakes while drinking, most of
us are still dumb kids. We are going to
get into trouble and make bad decisions
with or without alcohol in the mix. I
still got into a ﬁght with my date, and I
still got into similar bad situations that
I would’ve gotten into with the help of
alcohol. However. there was one thing
missing: the edge. The ﬁght with my
date didn’t seem nearly as apocalyptic,
and it didn’t last nearly as long. I still
ended up being pretty lazy throughout
most of the week, and my temperance
did not persuade me to once call my
family just looking to chat. However, I
still got to wake up every morning with-
out a headache or muddy clothes.

Finally, I noticed one last thing to-
wards the end of Fancy Dress. At Fancy
Dress there were plenty of students who
don’t ever drink who were having a
fabulous time. But there were plenty of
somewhat inebriated students also look-
ing to have a fantastic experience on the
dance ﬁoor.‘So, that got me thinking. On
Wednesday, when I was so miserable
being sober at the Southern Comfort
party, was it really alcohol’s fault or was
it simply that I was separating myself
from the fun? After Fancy Dress, I think
I guess the latter.

So, whatever your current relation-
ship with alcohol is, make sure that you
aren’t waking up in the morning with
regrets and more problems than you
had the morning before, and I’m guess-
ing you’ll have less headaches to worry

' about.

I understand and‘, to an extent, share Mr. Tokarczyk’s frustration with errors in
last week’s7story about the Pole 2 ﬁre. I do not seek to excuse those errors, but I
do wish to defend the Phi staff and state that we did the best we could under the

About 9:30, just as I was about to enter the Phi otﬁce to copy-edit, I saw on Twit-
ter (yes, Twitter) that Pole 2 had burned. Diandra and a few other people were in
the ofﬁce, and I asked them if they had heard this rumor. Diandra informed‘ me that
the rumor was true and that Stockton Bullitt was on the scene and had submitted a

news of the week; unfortunately, the cover page I

layout had already been designed pre-ﬁre. The Pole 2 ﬁre forced us to redesign the

front page. Meanwhile, our early morning Monday deadline‘ steadily approached.
Time that ordinarily would have been spent working with words became time spent
working with layout. We had limited resources ~ both time and people — with which
to pull the paper together.

In the stress of getting the paper together, factual errors slipped through, as well ,

as a clunky sentence. The address error is something that clearly could have been

avoided. I suspect that Mr. Tokarczyk knew Pole 2’s address because he’s a neigh-

bor. While the rest of us have no reason to know Pole 2’s address, the bottom line is

that we assumed it was right and went forward. That was our mistake. And, while

I’m not sure that the grammar error to which Mr. Tokarczyk points is actually an
. error, it is certainly a stylistic failure that should have been ﬁxed.

We also reported that Pole 2 was empty at the time of the ﬁre, and that power had
been cut off to the other Pole Houses. These statements were inaccurate. Here, we
reported the best information we had at the time. The Phi does not magically appear
on Monday afternoons. Our ﬁnal draft has to be at the print shop late Sunday night

or very early Monday morning. We did not have the luxury of waiting. We had to

get something on the page that night, and unfortunately, the only information we had
turned out to be inaccurate.

Did we have to get somethinglon the page that night‘? Absolutely. While Mr.
Tokarczyk castigates us for our errors, how much more odd would the Phi have
looked if there were no mention of the ﬁre at all? I am even more ﬂabbergasted

by Mr. Tokarczyk’s assertion that we exploited the young women living at Pole 2.
Reporting the news is what we do; it’s not exploitative to run an- article about the

biggest news on campus. Neither did we run the article simply out of a desire to
break the news. Twitter and F acebook had done that long before any text went into
the Phi computers. We had to say something about the Pole 2 ﬁre, because reporting
the news is what we do. Inaccuracies in the report are unfortunate occurrences, but
they are not exploitations. '

I am not a professional joumalist — at least, I am not a J-school major. I copy-edit
because Diandra is a friend who cannot put together the entire paper by herself, and
apparently nobody who has class in Reid Hall is interested in doing copy-editing.
I’m learning about journalism on the ﬂy; this is, perhaps, one of those things that
only happen at small liberal-arts schools like Washington and Lee. The episode sur-
rounding the Pole 2 ﬁre has taught me that newspapers are not the medium for
breaking news. because newspapers have limitations. Unfortunately, we are the only
traditional news medium that is consumed by any amountof the W&L community.

Had we gotten other, corrected facts before press time, we would have run them.

The sum of the matter, dear readers, is this: we will strive to do better in the
future. But keep in mind our limitations. We publish once a week; our deadline is
early Monday morning. When news breaks on Sunday night, we do the best we can. I

We will continue to report the facts to the best of our knowledge. If any of you, _es-
pecially I-school majors, feel you can do a betterjob than I do on the copy-editing

front, I will be happy to yield and leave the journalism to_the journalists. Until then,
continue to call us out where we fall short. A

Cows can breathe a si

gh of relief  

Well, a few can... Columnist and pescatarian Ali Greenberg explains her decision for a “meat-lite ” diet

By Ali Greenberg
COLU M NIST

While I generally write about cloth-
ing, I honestly have nothing else to
write about until Spring Term when the
lax pennies and croakies come out, so I
present to you a privileged insight into
my life choices. Just in case you cared.

I have been a Pescatarian, also
known as a “fake-vegetarian” for nearly
six years and l’ve been ﬁne.

The only thing keeping me from be-
ing a full on vegetarian is the fact that I
was weaned on sushi as a baby and my
body has developed a necessity to main-
tain obscenely high levels of mercury at
all times. Everyone knows that no harm
can come from excessive consumption
of Tom; just ask Jeremy Piven if you
don’t believe me.

So besides my sushi addiction, for
nearly 1/3 of my life I haven’t con-
sumed meat. No, chicken, no steak, and
no bacon. (It should be noted that pork
is just about the only thing that Jews and
Muslims agree on, so there may be some
validity to those woes.)

It wasn’t very hard for me to adjust.
I never really cared much for meat to
begin with, or at least not “every day”

day that it wasn’t the

“Plus, wouldn ’t I totally regret
not eating Guinea Pig when I

had the chance? ”

meat. I

What I missed was a mixed bag: pork
BBQ, brisket, country ham, meatballs
and a really good Gyro. It’s like a hoagie
or a sub, but you are just calling it the
wrong name. But this stuff wasn’t my
everyday fare in northern suburbia, so I
wasn’t really giving anything up.

Then one day I watched Super Size
Me and stopped with fast food. And
then I watched some PETA videos and
felt like by consuming the product I was
supporting the mistreatment of animals
that suffered horrible conditions in the
slaughterhouses before they were killed.

I want to be clear that I believe eat-
ing meat is a natural and normal human
choice, and I don’t think anyone is bad
for choosing to do it. I just decided one

choice for me.

So I decided to
try being a vegetar-
ian for a month, and
I never stopped.

That is, until
about a two months
ago when I went to
The Homeplace. Not

the Homestead. And this is the point in
the article where the boys who ﬂipped to
the Sports page are going to regret their
decisions.

The Homeplace is a southern Vir-
ginia staple, located in an old farmhouse
on a sprawling estate 15 minutes outside
of Roanoke. It’s the kind of place where
reservations don’t exist and I have never
waited less than 30 minutes for a table.
One time when my brother tried to pay
with an Amex, they told us to just mail
them a check later.

How’s that for an honor system?

Only there can $l6 get you so much.

/ You don’t order, you just decide two
meats or three meats and then you are
brought heaping quantities of fried

chicken, roast beef, country ham, green
beans, pinto beans, biscuits, apple but-
ter, cole slaw, mashed ‘potatoes and gra-
vy. Plus the vegetable of the day, which
is sometimes macaroni and cheese, and
on Thursdays there is Pork BBQ.

Oh yeah, and then they end the meal
with fruit cobbler. There is a phrase
for this kind of stuff-it is called “Food
Porn”.

So after years of literally smelling
other people’s plates (you taste a lot
with your nose), I decided I would see if
I was still missing out.

I grabbed a drumstick and took a bite.
And it was gross. Like, disgusting. Meat
is nasty. I realized all I actually craved
was the breading and seasoning. Fried
chicken is such a tease.

And although I am positive that it
would be delicious to anyone else, Ijust
simply don’t like meat anymore. I reas-
sured myself that I had made the right
choice and didn’t worry about any car-
nivorous temptations.

However, two weeks ago I found out
that I was accepted to a summer intem-
ship _in Peru. This is when I realized I

was kind of screwed.

I had passed off chorizo in Spain,
schwarma in Israel and bisteq in Uru-
guay, but an 8-week stay in Peru would
require a change. Spending my summer
studying poverty in a third-world coun-
try means that I need to actually assimi-
late. And it would be culturally insensi-
tive, difficult and just plain stupid to not
eat meat during my stay.

Plus, wouldn’t I totally regret not eat-
ing guinea pig when I had the chance?

So now I am slowly incorporating
meat back into my diet, and it SUCKS.
Chicken is bland and I spend every day
worrying about getting sick. But if I
don’t reprogram my body to digest and
metabolize more complex proteins, then
I am going to be seriously screwed when
I land in Cuzco.

Oh yeah, and getting used to the alti-
tude sickness and water parasites won’t
be a walk in the park either.

“AKA”what‘? Q&A about new srat

Sally Platt answers some intriguing questions about the newest sorority to join ranks at Washington and Lee

By Sally Platt
c 0 L U M N I s T

So you may have noticed those girls
around campus all decked out in pearls
and pink and green (and if you _haven’t,
you will soon). Who are they, and why
are they always yelling “skee-wee” at
each other? This Q&A will hopefully
answer those questions and help you get
to know the newest addition to W&L
Greek life!

Q: What does AKA stand for?

A: Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority (In-
corporated). -

Q: Then what is all this “Tau Zeta”
business about?

A: “Tau Zeta” is the unique W&L
chapter name, given to the Sorors upon
their chartering.

Q: So what will the group be known
as --- Tau Zeta or AKA?

A: AKA, because it is the nationally
recognized name. I

Q: Will AKA ever have a house?

A; No. As part of NHPC (National

Pan-Hellenic Council), not NPC (Na-
tional Panhellenic Conference), it will
not have a house. (It’s a Divine Nine
thing.) But, as someone observed to me,
“We’re‘AKA’s. We don’t need a house to
make ourselves legit.”

Q: Why at W&L, and why now?

A: Plans to bring AKA to W&L have
actually been in the works for at least
ﬁve years. This year, with the tremen-
dous help of Dean Futrell, everything
just ﬁnally came together. (We love our
Dean Tammy!)

Q: When exactly did all this happen?

A: On March 20th twelve W&L
women were initiated into AKA and
ofﬁcially chartered the Tau Zeta Chap-
ten. This was followed by a luncheon in
Evans Dining Hall attended by over two
hundred people. Besides featured speak-
ers such as Dean Watkins and the AKA
Regional Director, the real attraction
was Michael McGuire ’l3 who sang a

special tribute song (to thunderous ap-
plause). The new Sorors also sang their

chapter song “Diamonds and Pearls”

(to the tune of the Prince version of the
same name). '

Q: Speaking of songs, I’ve heard lyr-
ics to an old AKA chant that go, “One
plus one is two, Two plus one is three,
You better watch your man, Because
your man is watching me". Any com-
ments?

A: --------- --

Q: l’ve heard that AKA is a multicul-
tural sorority. Is that true?

A: Yes. AKA is a traditionally black
greek organization. It is in fact the ﬁrst
black greek sorority in America (sorry
Deltas). It was founded on January l5th,
1908, on the campus of Howard Univer-
sity.

Q: How has it changed since it’s
founding?

A: Although still keeping true to it’s

I

purpose of “Service to all Mankind,”

AKA has grown tremendously. Intema-
tionally, there are 250,000 members in
over 900 chapters.

Q: So AKA is a service organization?

A: Yes. Through its undergraduate
and graduate chapters AKA provides as-
sistance to the community in a variety
of ways, including education, health,
and ﬁtness. (But trust me --- this doesn’t
mean we don’t like to have fun!)

Q: What does the Tau Zeta Chapter
hope to accomplish on our campus?

A: Well, I can’t conﬁrm any of this,
but I’ve,heard that programming possi-
bilities for the near future include “Zum-
ba on the Green," First-Aid Certiﬁca-
tion, and care packages sent to women
at Living Waters for Girls (an Atlanta
organization dedicated to providing
victims of commercial sexual trade a
new beginning). And who knows, a step
show would always be fantastic! (The

Tau Zeta women have also already spent
a morning helping out at Boxerwood
Gardens). ,

Q: So who exactly is in the sorority?

A: Tau Zeta consists of twelve W&L
women from all grade-levels. They are:
Devin Cooper, Joan Oguntimein, Adri-
ana Gonzales, Amber Cooper, Mica
Winchester, Lavisha Redmon, Jeanine
Bailey, Kahena (Kiki) J oubert, De-Anna
Clarke,‘ Kira Sedberiy, Sally Platt and
Nichelle Corbitt.

Q: Who is the President?

A: Amber Cooper.

Q: What’s with the pearls?

A: The sororities was founded by
twenty women who have become known
as the “twenty pearls.” (Plus, pearls are
classy!....just like AKA’s).

Q: So what DOES “skee-wee” actu-
ally mean???

A: Well I could tell you....but then I’d
have to kill you. “Skeeee-wee!!!”

Patrick Smith recounts the greatest nostalgic moments of our
generation is pop culture past

By Patrick Smith
C 0 L U M N l ST

I have been thinking about writing

this article for quite some time now.
Just kidding, I just Google searched
“article ideas,” and this popped up.
This is you judging me; this is my care
face...

I I was sitting at the fraternity house

one day talking about all the stupid,

stuff kids are into these days like Justin
Beiber and Silly Bandz, and it made me
think about all the things I used to love
as a kid.

Even though the Washington and
Lee community is extremely geograph-
ically diverse, I’m sure most of you
share an appreciation for the fads you
are about to read, (Of course you could
stop reading this article altogether; once
again, care face...).

Without further hesitation, the com-
plete list of the guilty pleasures of our
childhoods:

Power Rangers

Power Rangers meant to my child-
hood as winning means to Charlie
Sheen. Back when I was a stupid little
ginger kid, I wanted but two things. I
wanted to operate a Zord, and to marry
the pink ranger, Kimberly. Also, I was
the red ranger for Halloween-twice.

Old School Nickelodeon Shows-

I’m talking about Hey Dude, Double
Dare, Salute Your Shorts, Legends of
the Hidden Temple, Are You Afraid of
the Dark?, Pete and Pete, Rocko’s Mod-
ern Life and, of course, Doug. They just
don’t make shows like these anymore.
I was always so pissed that I couldn’t
apply to be on Double Dare because I
have ﬁve family members. Ifl ever did
get selected to be on that show, I’d just
tell my sister there’s a Dawson’s Creek
marathon on.

Disc Men

I remember when the Disc Man
came out; I had to have one. Wearing
a heavy circular object attached to my
belt just seemed like the right thing to
do. Listening to the only good Smash
Mouth CD was just the icing on the
cake.

Crazy Bones ,

This has to be the dumbest of all the
toys kids used to play with back in the
day. Does anyone even know that Cra-
zy Bones is actually a game with rules?
I collected the hell out of these until my
ﬁfth grade teacher conﬁscated ’my two
favorite ones after I “allegedly” ran an
underground prostitution ring out of the
boys’ bathroom.

Pokemon Cards  

These were a HUGE deal. Hav-
ing holographic Pokemon cards was a
symbol of status amongst men. This
was another thing people collected and
never played with. Did the creators of
Pokemon cards actually think us kids
were smart enough to "understand the
rules of that game? Pokemon cards
were cool until I left my whole binder
at the Jersey Shore and lost every single
card. I cried for days, got over it and
moved on to the next waste of my par-
ent’s money.

Pogs

Ok, I take back what ,I said about
Crazy Bones. Pogs were the dumb-
est toy ever created. Whoever thought
that circular pieces of cardboard with
pictures on them were a good idea is
an idiot-likely a very wealthy idiot. I
collected the hell out of these until my
sister decided to douse all my Pogs in
water because set one of her Barbies on
ﬁre. ‘

I have plenty more items on this list
but quite frankly, care face. ..

Ladies’ Club unites to fight exploitation

The W&L Ladies ’ Club performed choreo-poetry readings to illustrate the horriﬁc world of sexual traﬁicking

By Devin Cooper
STAFF WRITER

Until recently, the commercial sexual
exploitation of enslaved persons, espe-
cially children, has been characterized
as a non-American issue. However, that
is not the case. The organization Living
Water for Girls illustrates this American
issue more poignantly:

“Young American girls are being
raped daily for profit in communities
we call home. Why‘? Because there are
adults who demand to have sex with our
children. This physical, mental, emo-
tional and spiritual trauma often leaves

With the passing of Fancy Dress
comes Washington and Lee’s next big
spring event: Nabors Spring Service
Day. This year’s service day falls on
Saturday, April 2nd. Following lunch on
Cannan Green, participants will spend
their afternoons engaging in various
local service projects. Through Nabors

the opportunity to get involved in the
Lexington community and get an idea
of what Nabors Service League has to

Washington and Lee Repertory Dance
Company will showcase pieces from students
and alumni Thursday to Saturday

By Adriana Gonzalez
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee Repertory
Dance Company will be performing in
the Lenfest Center for the Arts Thurs-
day, March 31st through Saturday, April
3rd. Performances on Thursday and
Friday will be at 7:30pm and at 2:00pm
on Saturday. This season’s performance
features choreography not only from
current students and guest artists but
also from dance company alumni A’rese
Emokpae ’l0 and Rasaq Lawal ’l0.

The highlights of the show include
two student pieces by dance minors
Stephanie Brown ’II and Dana Fred-
ricks ‘I2. About her piece, “Pearls of
Self-Destructive Wisdom”, Brown
comments, “How do you find yourself
with so many different voices, opin-
ions, and inﬂuences explaining what a
person should be. “Pearls of Self-De-
structive Wisdom” is about the journey
that searching for yourself and your
{voice amongst the many other voices
that surround each of us daily.” Along
with choreographing the piece, Brown
also created the music that accompanies
it. The piece will be performed by Ra-
chel Alexander ’13, Sally Nexsen ’l4,
and Jennifer Ritter ’l3. Brown has been
dancing most of her life and is a mem-
ber of Nu Delta Alpha, a dance honor
society.

Fredricks’ piece, “Boundless”, is an
aerial fabric piece that she will be per-
forming herself. “Does the possibility of
falling 20 ft. offthe fabric and plummet-
ing to the ground scare me? Quite pos-
sibly... but I do it anyways,” says Fred-
rick. Her interest was piqued. when she
was a part of the first aerial dance class
Spring Term 2009 which performed on
the side of Wilson Hall. Fredrick then
went on to take private classes in aerial
dance. Fredrick is the first student in
W&L’s dance history to choreograph
and perform a piece using aerial dance
fabric.

The concert also features pieces by
Ohad Naharin from the Batsheva Dance

Company in Israel, Shaleigh Comerford
and W&L Repertory Dance Company
Creative Director and assistant dance
professor Ienefer Davies.

The piece by Naharin entitled “Mi-
nus I6” features traditional Hebrew
music and dynamic movement. The
New York Times describes Naharin’s
choreography as “distinguished by stun-
ningly ﬂexible limbs and spines, deeply
grounded movement, explosive bursts
and a vitality that grabs a viewer by the
collar.”

Davies choreographed two pieces
for the concert, “Leon” and “Tragedy
of the Commons”. Leon is a unique
collaboration between dancers and the
Washington and Lee Chamber Singers.
The piece tells the story of the “Way of
St. James” or Camino Santiago, a pil-
grimage trail through France and Spain
to the tomb of St. James the Apostle.
Her other piece, “Tragedy of the Com-
mons”, is an interactive piece that incor-
porates audience input, live feedback
and economic theory. The piece is a col-
laboration of Davies, W&L professorl
designer Shawn Paul Evans and econo-
mist Anthony Davies.

Comerford’s piece “Composition in
Retrospect” is a “group collective piece
overseen by guest artist, Shaleigh Com-
erford, who modeled the creation of this
piece on her work with Forsythe Im-

 The issues behind the NFL lockout

A player-sympathizer covers the problems facing the league, especially whether there will be action thisiseason or not

 

 

By Megan Shaw
STAFF WRITER

No matter what kind of sports fan
you are, the months of September
through J anuary would be bare without
the NFL. So when the decertiﬁcation of
the National Football League Players
Association, or NFLPA, led to a player
lockout, the nation was certainly taken
aback.

The decertiﬁcation of the NFLPA
simply means that the players are no
longer in any relationship or associa-
tion with the NFL itself. They have, in
a sense, been “locked out” of the league.

After negotiations with the NFL over
a new collective bargaining agreement
failed to resolve their labor argument,
decertiﬁcation . was the players’ only

choice.

On March 4, the collective bargain-
ing agreement between the NFL and
its players expired since a new contract
could not be agreed upon. The NFLPA
no longer wanted to participate in col-
lective bargaining due to a discrepancy
in revenue split between the owners and
the players.

Although the NFL claims that 70
percent of the extra revenues were go-
ing to the players, they had only been re-
ceiving 52.9 percent of the incremental
increases to all revenues in the original
collective bargaining contract.

The players want to be assured that
they are not only being paid fairly, but
that they will be protected as a member

of an NFL team.

On March 11, the players were of-
ﬁcially locked out of their facilities by
the owners.

US District Judge David Doty ruled
that the NFL had been actively and stra-
tegically planning to lock out the players
for over two years. The NFL had con-
tracted TV networks like\DirectTV to
provide over $4 billion in revenue even
if something like the lockout were to
happen. Even though the owners could
go an entire season without ticket or
memorabilia or snack sales, they will
still have the cushion of the billion dol-
lar television agreements. Doty ruled
that the NFL was advancingonly its
own interests, rather than the players’.

The players’ best chance of prevent-
ing a prolonged lockout would be to

consider the protections provided by‘

federal anti-trust laws that forbid any
illegal corporate behavior. To protect
themselves and to protect their families,
the players would completely disaf-
ﬁliate with the union to pursue any kind
anti-trust case. Ten players, including
Drew Brees and Peyton Manning, have
already ﬁled an anti-trust lawsuit against
the NFL to attempt to combat the lock-
out.

Doty withdrew his earlier ruling that
had given the owners the right to that $4
billion in television revenue during this
period. This is great news for the players
because the owners will no longer Lise

that huge fund as insurance during the
lockout. At a later date, Doty will con-
sider granting the players with equitable
support and ﬁscal damages, so now it
will be almost impossible for the owners
to pay off their debt if there is a lengthy
lockout. .

With this lockout, an estimated $160
million would be lost in each NFL city
and over 100,000 jobs would be lost.
The lockout could ultimately com-
pletely eradicate the 2011-2012 NFL
season, but there is certainly hope that
it will only slightly disrupt the players’
preparation for what could be a success-
ful season.

Generals split double header with ODAC rival

The W&L baseball team recovered from an 11-inning, 12-8 loss in the ﬁrst game to move to a 10-10 season record

By Gretchen Frltchie
smrr wanrn

Following a one-run loss against
#1 Shenandoah on Tuesday (5-4), the

' Washington and Lee baseball team split

an ODAC doubleheader with Hampden-
Sydney on Saturday afternoon at Cap’n
Dick Smith Field.

In a much anticipated rivalry match-
up, the Generals fell to the Tigers 12-8
in 11 innings in the opener, but came
-back to win at 3-2 in the 9 innings of
the second game. Of their loss against

Shenandoah, co-captain Anthony Car-
dona said, “It was deﬁnitely disappoint-
ing coming up short against number one
Shenandoah. However our coaches did
a great job of getting us refocused and
prepared for H-SC.”

Losing the opener against the Hamp-
den—Sydney Tigers was tough for W&L.
Sophomore Alex Maragos even said
that his team expected to get on the ﬁeld
and sweep the team, but a late rally by

the Tigers in the 11th inning took any
chance of sweeping the competition
away from the Generals. Hampden-
Sydney sent nine hitters to the plate in
the llth inning, adding another 4 runs to
their score to pull of the 12-8 win.

Despite the hard loss in the back of
their minds, senior pitcher and co-cap-
tain Gregg Laswell gave the Generals
the heat they needed in the second game
to pull out a win.

Laswell didn’t allow a 141-SC hit un-
til the sixth inning, giving his team a
boost of motivation to get the runs they
needed to win atpthe bottom of the ninth.
Rallying with two outs in the last inning,
the Generals were able to bring in 3 hits
to give Laswell the win he deserved.

_ “It’s a good thing we had Laswell
pitching for us,” said Maragois. “He kept
us in the game even though we were hit-
ting very poorly.”

The W&L baseball team is now 10-
10 and 7-3 in conference play, and will
return to action this Tuesday at Eastern
Mennonite for a 3pm matchup.

The Washington and Lee Gener-

Lejeune, N.C. last weekend to compete
in the Camp Lejeune Intercollegiate

The tournament included 32 teams play-

two days of competition.

The Generals struggled during the
ﬁrst day of competition on Friday, post-
ing a team score of 307. They played

the Gold course (Par 72), the more difﬁ-

F irst-year Jack Cottrill led the way post-

one. Senior Tom Bowden was the only
other General to break 80 and logged an

The Washington and Lee men’s lacrosse
team upended ODAC rival and 16th ranked
Lynchburg 4-3 on Saturday, improving their
conference record to 3-0. The win was their

4th in a row, a streak that included another’

one goal win at Hampden-Sydney a week
ago. i

The Generals‘ offense was powered by
the attack as four different attackmen scored.
Senior Spence Daw added one to his team-
high 14 goals in the first quarter. Junior Scott
Meehan tallied one in the second quarter.
Sophomore Mac Means added one in the
third, and [sophomore Jack Switala notched
the game winner with 12:31 left in the ﬁnal

‘period.

However, the Generals were able to win
on the strength of their defense, which held
Lynchburg scoreless for the opening and
closing quarters. They were especially mas-
terful as they held tight while short two men
due to penalties towards the end of the third
quarter. ‘

Men ’s lacrosse wins fourth straight game and remains undefeat

STAFF WRITER

Senior Jason Lumpkin continued his ex-
cellent play in goal with ten saves, including
turning back a shot from point blank range
with one minute left to play. lniaddition, he
picked up a team high seven ground balls.
Sophomore defenseman Joe LaSala was re-
sponsible for ﬁve of the 17 turnovers the
Generals’ defense caused on the day.

The four game run was started when the
Generals defeated Kenyon 13-7 at home.
They were led in that game by Daw and
Switala, who each had three goals and two
assists. ' ‘

They followed that up with a dramatic 9-8
win at Hampden-Sydney to open up ODAC
play. Means, Daw andjunior Sam Mott each
had two goals, Lumpkin notched 14 saves,
and junior Scott Meehan had the game-win-
ning goal with 5:4l left. H-SC was ranked
l3th in the country at the time.

The Generals kept the streak alive when
Guilford came to town with an ll-l victory.

Switala had a hat trick, but the rest ofthe of-

fense was very spread out as eight other play-
ers each had one goal.

The Generals took their win streak into
the Lynchburg game and defended their home
turf. In doing so, they started the ODAC sea-
son 3-0 for the first time in the careers of any
of the current players. T

“We are deﬁnitely sitting in the driver’s
seat this season, controlling our own destiny
for the ODAC tournament,” said captain JD
Englehart. “We have the opportunity to get a
few home games, which is huge.”

And the current winning streak? Daw said
it best: “Everybody loves a hot streak.”

The Generals will try to keep it alive on
Tuesday when they travel to Georgetown
University to play 7th-ranked Middlebury
College.

The Generals have a 3-0 confer-
ence record, including a 4-3 win
over #16 Lynchburg.

New spring
term addition

Alum is $50 millionfunds
creation of campus gorilla pit

By Samuel Adams
BREWER, PATRIOT

In a joint announcement Thursday, the University
Registrar, along with the Biology Department and
the Development Office, showcased the newest on-
campus Spring Term class. According to the syllabus,
Biology 369, Wildlife Management, will be exploring
gorillas in the wild — here in Lexington. Not even a
trip to the Natural Bridge Safari Park will be neces-
sary for the students, as the gorillas will be housed
in an enclosure between the Commons and Woods
Creek Apartments.

According to the Development Office, the ability
to .purc}fase and contain the apes was courtesy of a
$50 million gift from an anonymous alumnus, who
apparently thought that W&L had no other pressing
issues. "i,‘Certainly the relatively new concert hall is
supposed to have leaking pipes, and of course the
fence around Payne Hall will be taken down in time
for graduation,” said this nameless alum. “I think
what today’s students need is the ability to examine
gorillas in the wild in the morning and tube the Maury
in the aftemoon.”

Biology professors were ecstatic over the addition
of the ape enclosure. One said, “I will ﬁnally be able
to engage students in my research about the social
and mating habits of bipedal primates, ones closely
relatedito those found on Windfall Hill. My commute
time to my research ﬁeld will be cut in half.”

The’ gorillas will arrive in Lexington next week.
According to Dining Services, which has the new re-
sponsibility of helping produce the food to feed the
gorillas, sustainably-produced, fair-trade organic ba-
nanas will be the staple of choice for the apes.

Tour guides were excited about a new stop on their
route.

“It used to be that when we walked over the foot-
bridge into or out of the back of the Commons, we
just had to ramble about how great W&L is,” one
said. “Now we can stop and point out the gorillas.
This allows us to save all our bullshit for the rest of
the tour." Did you know that Washington and Lee is
the onlyliberal arts college with at Lee Chapel Vam-
pire, championship sports teams and a gorilla pit?
OH GOD IT’S A SIGN WITH OUR SEXUAL AS-
SAULT RATE! TAKE IT DOWN, TAKE IT DOWN,
TAKE IT DOWN.” V _

million oh a gorilla pit, but nobody was able to ﬁgure
out why.‘

F rea/it social climbing
A accident injures two ﬁrst-
year students

By Mercedes Benn
snxrr wmr-an

Reports have come in to the Ring-tum Phi regard-
ing a scare involving two ﬁrst-year students during
a freak social climbing accident this weekend. The
names of the students, one male and one female, are
being withheld in an attempt to protect their reputa-
tions. (But just ask around at srat lunch and you can
ﬁnd out.)

Both students are reported to be in good physical
health but,are allegedly seeking immediate transfer
applicationsilto similar small and southern private lib-
eral arts colleges like Sewanee.

We havereceived reports that this weekend’s inci-
dent was not the ﬁrst social climbing attempt by the
couple. Both allegedly attempted to secure early bids
during theirvisits to campus on Accepted Students
Day in 2010.

The only information we have regarding the stu-
dents is that the male attended a prestigious northern
prep school in a hotbed lacrosse area, and the female
hails from a nondescript and interchangeable southern
city where she was set to debut this coming winter.

While the details of the accident are still uncon-
ﬁrmed, sources say that a golden ladder, a fanny pack,
a Range Rover, Kenan & Kel and six cases of old-
school 4 Lokg were believed to have been involved.

Now that Karl Rove has been of-

However, as time wore on, Burr’s

had to ask for a favor from an old
family friend.

God and the Datzs have always
been on a ﬁrst name basis. “Burr

campus to get intimately acquainted
with. The cornerstone of the religion
boasts a heaven of beer volcanoes
and stripper factories. '

And, Wallingstinworth’s devo-
tion to this religion does not stop

there. He has taken to adhering to the
doctrine of the Church of the Flying
Spaghetti Monster by donning pirate
garments. He hopes that by dressing
like a buccaneer he can prevent the
extinction of the masters of the sea,
therefore combating recent natural
disasters associated with their disap-
pearance. Followers of the delicious
pasta monster believe that pirates are
divine beings which have been por-
trayed negatively by Christian propa-
gandists for centuries.

Wallingstinworth plans to hold
a charity spaghetti dinner to raise
funds for his new religious center. He
will be charging $50 per plate, which
can be swiped home.

Hudson
indicted  

W&L junior charged with

selling marijuana

Bysage Um
STAFF WRITER

Harrison Hudson, junior football player, has
been indicted on four felony counts for the sale of

marijuana.

Hudson was indicted by a Rockbridge County
Circuit Court grand jury on Feb. 7 for two charges
for distributing marijuana and two charges for dis-
tributing on school property last year in March and

April. He was arrested a few days ago.

I

Hudson, 2l, told the Roanoke Times last week
that he never sold marijuana. However, the paper

reported that Hudson sold to an undercover police _

informant. ,

Public defender Ross Haine was appointed to de-

fend Hudson at a hearing on March 14.

Hudson’s drug arrest is not the ﬁrst at Washing-
ton and Lee. Former W&L student Richard Hahn
is serving a three-year sentence for selling cocaine

after he did not deny the charges.

Hudson was recently elected to be a tri-captain
for the football team and led the team to winning the

ODACS last fall.

The Social

Animal

Author and columnist David

Brooks speaks at W&L

By Paige Gance
STAFF WRITER

Lee Chapel ,was packed beyond capacity by
the time Tom Wolfe, wearing his trademark white
suit, introduced New York Times columnist David
Brooks. Brooks was the keynote speaker for the
eighth annual Tom Wolfe weekend seminar, co-
sponsored by the 20I2 Mock Convention and the
Class of I95], in honor of their classmate Wolfe,
best-selling author and renownedjoumalist.

. The lecture, titled “Paradise Imagined: Political
and Social Values in the Facebook Era,” centered on
themes ofhow modern culture can have both an ob-
vious and subtle inﬂuence on social interaction and
what aspects of life we ﬁnd most important.

Brooks said that he always wanted to be a writer.
For that role he needed “to see the visible and the
invisible.” He described how in his early days of
journalism helused to people watch at shopping cen-
ters or observe the social skills of politicians.

A writer needs to see the surface and the under-
currents, said Brooks, “that’s what Tom [Wolfe] has

done, and what I try and do.”

Brooks said that many of the recent studies com-
ing out ofﬁelds like neuroscience and psychology
are placing more emphasis on factors that can’t be
measured. Terms like “mindsight,” the ability to
understand what is going on in another’s head, and
“metis,” being able to identify what matters, may be
more important in determining success in life than
traditional factors like SAT scores and GPA, said

Brooks.

According to Brooks, the three main insights
he "has gleaned from these scientiﬁc ﬁelds are that
most thinking is unconscious, emotion and reason
are not opposed, and what he calls interpenetration

ofminds.

“A lot of the smartest action is unconscious,”

said Brooks.

He then turned to the subject of American cul-
ture, both its praiseworthy aspects and troublesome
vices. Because of our “moral materialism,” our de-
sire to make it in life, Brooks said he will “never be
pessimistic about the future ofAmerica.’’ ‘

He said he has seen, however, a shift from hu-
mility to self-expression, narcissism and the rise the
“Me” culture. In a I950 Gallup poll, 12 percent of
high school seniors thought they were important. In
2005, that number ballooned to 80 percent. Another
study revealed that when asked to choose between
receiving a compliment or sex, more people chose

the former. _
“Wrong answer,” said Brooks.

Nevertheless, Brooks expressed a conﬁdence in
the youngest generation based on a number of social

indicators.

“Crimes are down, teenage pregnancies are
down, violence is down, suicides are down, drug

use is down," he said.

Brooks is the author of Bobos In Paradise.‘ The
New Upper Class and How T hey Got There and On

Paradise Drive." How We Live Now (And Always _

Have) in the Future Tense.

His latest book is The Socia/Aninzal: The Hidden
Sources ofLove, Character, and Achievement.

Student Body Hearing  

Editor ’s note.‘ Although the facts of this case are conﬁdential, the hearing chair and
seargant-at—arms support coverage of the hearing policies and procedures

By Eleanor Kennedy
N EW s E D IT 0 R

The Washington and Lee com-
munity will gather in Lee Chapel this
Thursday for the open hearing of a
student found guilty of an Honor Vi-
olation by the Executive Committee.

According to the White Book,
which contains the regulations of
the Honor System, a student who is
found guilty of an Honor Violation
may appeal the decision to a Student
Body Hearing.

If a student accepts the E.C.’s
initial decision, he may withdraw
from the university. But if the student
chooses to take "the case to an open
hearing and is found guilty, he will be
expelled and his transcript will read
“dismissed.”

The last open hearing on W&L’s
campus happened four years ago. At
that hearing the accused student was
found not guilty. Before that hearing,
there had not been one for 16 years.

Last week, the E.C. advocates and
honor advocates of the accused se-
lected a chair. Third year law student
Katharine Lester, president of the
Student Bar Association, is serving
as chair for the hearing.

Junior Chris Washnock was ap-
pointed sergeant-at-arms by the E.C.

last week as well.
According to the White Book,

open hearings are conducted in front ,

a jury of 12 students. In order to cre-
ate the jury, the registrar generated a
list of 75 potential jurors. Washnock
contacted all 75 and, following to the
procedures in the White Book, the
list is being narrowed to 14 jurors.
Twelve will sit asjurors and two will
serve as alternates.

The hearing will begin at 9 a.m.
Thursday morning. Doors will open
at 8 a.m.

Sergeant-at-arms Chris Washnock
said students will be able to enter and
leave the chapel after opening state-
ments and between witnesses.

The hearing will close for lunch
between noon and l :30 but doors will
reopen at 1:00 ‘pm.

Everyone must leave the chapel
during the lunch hour.

“If you come at 8 a.m. expecting
to stay through the whole hearing,
you will be ushered out at noon,”
Washnock said.

Depending on the number of wit-
nesses, Washnock said the trial may
end any time between 5 and 7 p.m.

After closing statements, the jury

will deliberate. The White Book
does not mandate a unanimous deci-
sion. Eight votes either way will be
enough to ﬁnd the accused guilty or
not guilty.

When a verdict has been reached,
the bells of Washington Hall will ring
and students will be readmitted. The
chair will announce the verdict 20
minutes after the bells ring.

Although all members of the
campus community are invited to the
hearing, entrance is not guaranteed.
Lee Chapel has 500 seats and no one
will be allowed to stand. Those who
do wish to attend must be dressed in
Lee Chapel attire and have a valid
current l.D. card.

Attendees may not bring back-
packs, purses, notebooks, pens,
phones, cameras or any other record-
ing devices into the chapel. Alcohol
is also forbidden and students who
choose to drink beforehand will be
turned away, Washnock said.

“We will also be actively check-
ing for visual signs of intoxication,”
Washnock said. .

As the two broadcast mailers
which have been sent to the com-
munity emphasized, the facts of the

hearing must be kept conﬁdential.
Washnock said he hopes students
will respect both the Honor System
and the accused student.

“If you’re showing up to Lee
Chapel looking for a spectacle, then
you have the wrong attitude,” Wash-
nock said. “And if you’re looking for
i_dle gossip then you have the wrong
frame of mind as well.”

The White Book is available in
PDF form on the E.C. web page. Stu-
dent who have questions about the
way the hearing will run can consult
the section titled “Procedure for the
Student Body Hearing.”

The hearing is entirely student
run. Washnock said it’s important to
remember that the Honor System is
decided on and administered by stu-
dents and students alone.

“This is our hearing,” Washnock
said. “This is not Kate [Lester]’s
hearing, this is not my hearing, this
is not the E.C.’s hearing. This is our
hearing.”

Armstrong wins Mr. W&L

Campus-widecontest raises money for former residents of Pole 2 by bidding onfrat men

By Emily Mosh
STAFF WRITER

And the title goes to...David
Armstrong!

Armstrong, a senior Sigma Chi, is
officially been the ﬁrst Mr. W&L.

Members of Kappa Alpha Theta,
Kappa Delta and the Peer Counsel-
ing Service came together this past
week to help the girls of Pole 2
whose home was destroyed in a ﬁre
last month.

Sophomores Caroline Schmidt
and Elizabeth Bucklee came up with
the idea ofthe Mr.‘ W&L contest.

“We talked to the peer counselors
about it," said Schmidt. “We really
wanted to get them in on the idea.
Doing that got the school involved
on a broader spectrum.”

Schmidt emailed each fraternity
on campus and explained the idea.
She asked them each to send her a
nominee for the contest and a wa-
ger fora funny activity
he would do if he won.

All 15 fraternities

 
   
 
 
   
  
  

responded to her with a nominee,
though one did have to back out of
the contest at the last minute. The

wagers ranged from hair dying to

fantasy dates, from the nominee
dancing in Commons to wearing full
spandex body suits on the hill.

Students from the organizations
involved manned a table in the Com-
mons from Tuesday until Friday
where people could donate toward
their favorite candidate.

Armstrong surpassed the runner
up at the last minute and ended up
winning by almost $1,400.

“I was chosen [as a nominee] by
the‘ executive committee of our fra-
ternity,” said Armstrong. “I’m pretty
pumped about the whole wager.”

Arrnstrong’s ofﬁcial wager read:
“David Armstrong will dye his hair
a color of the girls’ choosing, spend
the rest of his days at W&L rid-
ing around campus on a mini bike,
wearing a leather jacket, carrying

 

and worn denim‘ for a week.

a Super Soaker gun, acting like Ar-
nold Schwarzenegger in The Tenni-
nator, and saving people from harm
and whatnot. He will also Dougie in
front of the commons during the ﬁrst

week of Spring Term (Date TBA),

while his Super Soaker and Mini
Bike stand by.”

“Honestly, what guy doesn’t want
to roll around campus acting like the
Tenninator? 'l’m ordering the mini
bike today,” he said. “You can ex-
pect me to start rolling around when
Spring Term starts.”

Armstrong does plan on dying his
hair and insisted he won’t complain
about it, regardless of the girls’ color
choice.

According to the ofﬁcial event
page for the contest, “whoever wins
will live in infamy and get a Mr.
W&L banner in the commons next
week.”

Armstrong said he’d like to see
the Mr. W&L Contest be an annual

event, beneﬁtting local charities. He
also has a few other ideas for future
fundraising efforts by the W&L com-
munity.

“When is the Miss W&L compe-
tition going to start up? “ Armstrong
asked. ‘‘I mean, if we are going to
celebrate one male student, we prob-
ably need to celebrate one female
student, as well.”

All those involved in making this
year’s contest happen said they were
blown away by its success.

“It just really shows how kind
people are,” said Schmidt. “They
want to be involved, they want to
help.” .

So keep an eye out for a Termi-
nator look-alike during Spring Term,
and know that no matter what color
his hair is, he’s rolling around on his
mini bike for all the right reasons.

 The problemwit J-School majors

By not having more journalism students participate in the Ring-tum Phi, the Journalism School is hurting its image

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

I’d like you to imagine a couple of

scenarios before we get into the meatw

ofmy article. Imagine you are sitting in
the stands watching a Washington and
Lee football game. Even though it’s the
ﬁrst half (otherwise why would you be
watching?), the Generals are already
losing by quite a few points.

As you are contemplating which
party you will attend in the late after-
noon, you hear a bawling laugh in the
row in front of you. Sitting in front of
you is a 350 pound, 6’5” behemoth ofa
sophomore taking delight in the feeble

- efforts of the 200 pound General offen-

sive lineman.

Now tell me, wouldn’t you see
something wrong with this situation?

How about if you hear a business
major making fun of the historians who
are horribly running WlS’s portfolio
into the ground?

What would you think about the
politics department dissuading their

. * students to stay away from Mock Con?

Maybe it’s me, but doesn’t the suc-
cess of Mock Convention have at least
some reflection on the politics depart-
ment?

Thankfully, we don’t‘ have any of
these problems on campus. Our football
team is well sized enough to have the
most fearsome ground game since Jim
Brown’s Browns; WIS is ﬁlled with
ﬁnance nerds who are turned on by
spreadsheets and stress tests; and Mock
Con is fully staffed by hopeful politicos
so dedicated to the Republican cause,
they have started using Boehner’s self-
tanner.

However, we here at the Ring-tum
Phi ﬁnd ourselves the black sheep of
W&L’s journalism family. So I have
an opinion for you, what the hell is the
matter with a department that doesn’t
support its own student organization?

This brings me to my next point. I
freaking hate copy editors. They ruin
my jokes and usually take out most of
the material that would make my col-
umns a little too explicit. Worst of all,
they beat me to the punch.

Last week, copy editor Samuel
Gilleran had a wonderful response to
a letter to the editor about me. He did
a wonderful job pointing out that most
of the staff at the Ring Tum Phi aren’t
actually part of thejoumalism school.

The head editors mostly are J-
School students, but they do an inor-
dinate amount of work. If this were
Harvard, I would be totally cool with
my editor-in-chief staying up until four
or ﬁve in the morning every weekend
because I would know that there were
at least a hundred people vying for her
job. However, this is W&L, and she
is pulling those hours simply because
there simply aren’t enough people with
her expertise to help out her work load.

Now, I should explain a little about
me. To paraphrase The Hangover, I’m
no hero, I’m just a politics major. I have
been the opinions editor of the Ring-
tum Phi for the last two years for two
reasons: I) I have such a deﬂated ‘sense
of self worth that I feel that I need to

legitimize myself by seeing my name

in print (in other words, I’m cocky as
shit) and 2) nobody else wants the job.
I never have and never will take a jour-
nalism class at this school, meaning that
I probably shouldn’t be an editor, yet,
here I am. Honestly, if this were ﬁve
years ago and two seniors had realized
how to use goddamn pseudonyms when
writing a bracket referencing students
at this school, I would be writing for
The Trident right now.

Also, I am a huge hypocrite. I ac-
tively pursue reactions that come in the
form of letters to the editor, and when
my writers do receive criticism, I tell
them to not take it personally and to not
blow a gasket.

However, last week a journalism
student wrote a letter to the editor, and I
still can’t ﬁnd my gasket.

It wasn’t because he said that I was
exploiting the Pole 2 ﬁre by reporting
three incorrect facts. I fail to realize
how me writing down the wrong ad-
dress helps me selﬁshly utilize off of
the ﬁre, but I’m sure the writer of that

letter knew what exploitation actually
was.

Look, I didn’t even ﬁnd it that ironic
that he told me that I was disrespect-
ing journalism by reporting incorrect
facts when, later in the same issue, he
incorrectly reported that the next golf
tournament was on Friday ,April 1st
(according to the athletic website, it’s
on Monday, April 4th ). Okay, maybe
it was a little ironic (little advice, next
time you try and call to kettle black,
make sure you aren’t a pot). Still, the
main problem I have with this letter to
the editor wasn’t that I was getting criti-
cized because I got over that after a few
tears in the fetal position. The problem
I had was that this sentiment is emblem-
atic of the entire J-School.

I have had arguments with joumal-
ism students about working for the
Ring-tum Phi before. There are two
popular responses for why the Ring-
tum Phi isn’t chock full of journalism
students.

The ﬁrst argument at least makes
sense. Journalism students are far too
busy working on the Rockbridge Re-
port to make enough time in their days
to also work on the Phi. I get that. For
the ﬁrst time in my career here at W&L,
I checked out the Rockbridge Report
website. I gotta hand it to the producers
of that website, it’s well run and looks
fantastic. Although the site is well done
and the YouTube videos by “wlunews”
are also well produced, why do these
two mediums of information work at
such an expense to both the Ring Tum
Phi and the student body in general?
This is where I see more of a structural
issue within the J-School than simply
individual decisions by the students
themselves.

For the journalism school, the Rock-
bridge Report newscast and online edi-
tion are both superior and separate from
the Ring-tum Phi. This is because the
journalism school dare not feign inter-
est in lowly student issues in lowly pa-
per print media. That’s the past!

Also, I’m guessing that the Rock-

, WASHINGT ON AND LEE
‘ ‘&UNIVERSITY STORE

bridge Report isn’t serving as many
people as its wonderful production sug-
gests it does, because otherwise their
videos wouldn’t struggle to achieve 100
total views.

To quickly sum up that last point for
the alumni and parents who arereading
this article: your tuition and donation
money is going towards very serious
production that is not being watched by
the majority of residents in Rockbridge
County.

Likewise, your money is funding
classes such as Journalism 353: Opin-
ion Writing (thanks, Registrar!) that

cannot seem to produce a single student I

interested in writing a single opinion for
the school newspaper you are now read-
ing. Find a problem with that?

This brings me to my biggest prob-
lem with the entire structural conun-
drum of the journalism school and the
second argument I usually hear from
J-School majors. I .

They tell me, “Why should ljoin the
Phi when it’s already bad? It’s not like‘
I’m going to make more majors join or
make the paper better by myself.” May-
be it’s the dirty liberal in me. Maybe
it’s the optimist in me. Or maybe it’s
the fact that this argument is simply
bullshit. Regardless, I think that a few
more joumalsim students participating
in acutal student journalism would help
the Phi out tremendously. The mindset
these journalism majors have means
that there is a deeper problem with the
J-School.

To put it bluntly, the journalism
school at W&L looks down with dis-
dain at the Ring-tum Phi’s alternative
method of media the exact same way
that the journalism industry looked
down with disdain at the new media
wave a decade ago.

In this way, the journalism school
is perfectly setting up their students to
graduate with the same sense of elitism
that most of their dying industry shares.
I am pretty sure that W&L wouldn’t
hire former editors who refused to em-
brace new journalism during the onset

of the age of online media 10 years ago,
but given the way that they are refusing
to embrace our different form of jour-
nalism, I wouldn’t be that surprised.

The letter in response to my article
stated, “Newspapers and other legiti-
mate news organizations will have
no future if they stoop to the level of
blogs and Twitter.” Considering how
dearly newspapers are paying for only
recently resorting to the level of blogs
and Twitter (see: @nytimes and http://
www.nytimes.com/interactive/blogs/
directory.html), I think the biggest
problem newspapers are having isn’t
allying themselves with different forms
of content or reporting incorrect facts,
which I’m told newspapers also do
quite frequently. Rather, the main mis-
take newspapers made was being too
overconﬁdent in their own self worth
to ﬁnd viable income options for their
online content during the origination of
the intemet boom. But, hey, what do I
know? Why don’t you ask WIS because
they actually have business majors in
their organization?

We here at the Ring-tum Phi have
seen an editor quit because he or she
did not want his or her participation in
the Ring-tum Phi mentioned on his or
her resume. Perplexing as that logic is,
it is not uncommon among journalism
students at this school.

So, J-School, I have one last request
before you collectively write the letter
to the editor that will end all letters to
the editor: please keep making sure the
Ring-tum Phi stays off your resumes
and the unwatched YouTube videos
stay on them.

I want journalism to be RESPECT-
ED because it’s always important to re-
spect those who are quickly approach-

ing irrelevance. Enjoy your high status -

in the industry, and I’ll keep writing
about frats and Twitter.

Getting to know Various classmates on a new level .

Campbell Burr asks questions to random students and discovers much more about them than she thought she would

By Campbell Burr
STAFF WRITER

You sit with them in class. You greet
them on the Colonnade. You dance with
them at band parties. You sing with
them on Traveler. You hook up with
them. But do you really know them?
Here are some stories to get you better
acquainted with some of the faces you
see every day.

CB: Pat, if you could change one
quality that most girls have, what would
it be?

“The ﬁrst thing that comes to my
mind when I see girls is, ‘What would
my mom think?’ For this I have a very
critical way of looking at girls. I ﬁnd
myself preferring more conservatively
dressed girls. Around campus, I feel
embarrassed and ashamed at myself
for looking at a tight ﬁtting blouse or
a short skirt. I usually correct this mis-

 

take pretty quickly, but in most cases
what’s done is done. I follow these
episodes with a short video conference
with Mommy to purge these impure
thoughts. It’s a confession in a way. I
want to see girls in one-piece bathing
suits, skirts so long that they are frayed
from sweeping the ground and puffy
jackets year round. Cover up, honestly.
I don’t want to know ifthey have an in-
me or an outie until our wedding night.
Also ifa girl makes eye contact with me
before the third date, we’re dunzo. With

these standards in mind, my ideal girl in
terms of my favorite actresses has the
innocence of Bree Olson, a lower unit
similar to Tori Black’s and a top side
like a young Sophie Dee.”

CB: Jared, describe your ﬁrst kiss.

“My ﬁrst kiss was everything it was
hyped up to be, straight outof a movie.
I asked the certain someone to go for a
walk and then a short time after play-

    

ing on a playground, it happened. I did
not see it coming but it did. It was a
funny feeling that is hard to describe.
It’s that excitement where the rest of the
night you feel like a million bucks. The
only stipulation is that the girl never re-
sponded to me the next day. Girls are
lame.”

CB: Amanda, describe your most
embarrassing moment.

“This past fall I was fortunate
enough to study abroad at St Andrews
University for the W&L Organic Chem-

, istry Partnership. I learned all sorts of
things over there, some academic, while
others were more... life lessons, if you
will. One such life lesson involved the
holiday of Halloween, a Troll doll cos-
tume and a few too many Tesco brand
wine juice boxes. The next morning,
being the diligent student that I am, I
got out ofbed, looked at my wildly pink

hair and decided that going to organic
was more important than washing the
heinous pink dye out of my hair. This
‘was the wrong decision, and I should
have given up while I was behind, as,
due to my dehydrated state, I got sick
before I even left the dorm. I marched
on to chem with my pink hair, arms
covered in marker, and proceeded on
leaving the room twice to evacuate my
stomach. As if this wasn’t embarrass-
ing enough, I also needed to go to the
library to write the last 500 words for
my Scottish history paper. I had brought
water and an apple to attempt to ease
my throbbing head and turning stom-
ach. A few hundred words in, I decided
to nibble my apple. This was the worst
decision ofa long list of bad decisions.
Hardly had I swallowed the ﬁrst bite of
apple when my stomach rebelled, in-
spiring me to run to the bathroom that
was just around the comer. As luck

would have it, the janitors had decided
that this was the optimal time to clean,
and therefore, just as I was rounding the
corner, they locked the door. I looked
at the man sealing my fate and begged
him to open the door. He looked back
at me and shook his head. I looked him

in the trash can that he had emptied just
moments before. I then sprinted away in

disgust, embarrassment, but with a cer-
tain sense of pride. That pride soon van-
ished when one of my Scottish friends
came up to me and told me that one of
her friends had posted on his Facebook
that ‘Some American with pink hair had
just chundered in the library.’ Guilty as
charged.”

CB: Harper, what is the most roman-
tic thing you have ever_done for a girl?

“I’m truly not a very romantic per-
son, but I deﬁnitely know how to treat a

 

lady with respect. I guess one instance
would be when I took this girl with me
to play golflast summer. It was a really
nice evening spent walking 9 holes un-
til dusk, ending with a nice steak dinner
in the clubhouse. Afterwards we went
out and had an awesome night with the
rest of our friends. It wasn’t a special
night by any means, but we
both ended up having a blast.”

 

CB: Jay, if you were to be featured
on a reality TV show, what would it be?

“lfl were to be featured on a real-
ity TV show, it would be called ‘Living

live with a different species of animal

called ‘Living With Animals: Hangin’

“If I could have a superpower,
I would want the power of reading

While most of us will be packing our
bags and heading south to Gulf Shores for
a week of sun, sand, and. . .soda, not every-
one will be partaking in the stereotypical
college spring break this year.

While I am totally in support ofthis rite
of passage, it will be at least another year
till I subject myselfto sea lice and an I.V.
of strawberry daiquiris.

Instead I will be spending my break
with family, and it’s going to be awesome!
At least I keep telling myself

educational expenses.

So I managed to get my name on a free
10-day trip to Israel in December, and then
I convinced my dad to send me to stay with
family for Feb Break in New York. But
with my Spring Break fast approaching, I
didn’t know what I was going to do.

Despite being broke, I put my name
down for my sorority’s trip to Ft. Morgan.
However, immediately after sending the
email I remembered three things.

that.
I sometimes miss out on

started with senior year beach
week. Somehow spending it

Spring Break.

In 3 Myrtle B€8Cl'l IT10'E€l and  

drinking warm Natty was not
a very appealing proposal.

Instead, my cousin and fellow graduate
and I drove down to Florida for a “classy”
week at her family’s condo. Since the mean
age on the island is around 65, it was a wild
time to say the least.

Then came freshman year, and I was so
excited for my ﬁrst college spring break
with my sorority. Until I realized I was
broke from my February Break trip to
South America and my dad told me I had
to come home to walk the dogs in the after-
noons. It was as pathetic as it sounds.

Then I spent the summer in New York,
where I worked as an unpaid intern in a
fashion show room. Due to this, I entered
sophomore year broker than I left it and my
dad was no longer going to count my Sun-
day night Tong Dynasty dinners as cultural

Spring Break.

2. Our entire school will be there. This
is not a vacation. That is a ﬁeld trip.

And most importantly,

3. There is a reason I have never been
to Alabama.

But before I get another letter to the edi-
tor, the actual most important reason is that
my brother is joining the Peace Corps and
leaves for the former U.S.S.R. at the end
ofour Spring Break. (You don’t know how
lucky you are, boy!)

So more than anything, I realized I
wanted to spend time with my family. I
removed my name from the list, and I im-
mediately tried to organize some sort of
family vacation, a la Chevy Chase.

That’s when I remembered my family
is about as dysﬁinctional as the Aristocrats,
and this made planning a trip a lot more
difﬁcult than it sounds. (That joke was
disgusting, but I doubt anyone even under-
stood it.)

_Seeing as we are city folk, the idea of
renting a quaint cabin did not appeal to my
brother.

Instead, he suggested a destination
where we could all do our own thing during
the day and reconvene for dinner.

So where was this riveting place where
we would all be able to occupy and enter-
tain ourselves for three days?

Baltimore. I kid you not. That was his
genius suggestion. I cannot even make a
joke about how ridiculous that is.

I think we can all agree that Baltimore
was not happening. So, I kicked my broth-
er out of my family vacation and for three
days I became set on a father-daughter get-
away to an Ashram. How is that for Eat,
Pray, Love? Get at me, Julia Roberts.

But then my dad said he wanted to go
somewhere nicer, I remembered that I hat-
ed yoga, and now we have about two weeks
with nothing to do but walk the dog.

I may try again for my spring break ad-
venture next year, but for now I realized
that eating Chinese take out and watching
a marathon of Curb Your Enthusiasm with
my brother and my dad and my dogs is all I
really want. Baltimore, Gulf Shores and the
Yogaville Satchidananda Ashram can wait.

= Sorry, but Tartan is just not our style

W&L women defeated the Carnegie Mellon Tartans (apparently this is a type of dog) on Saturda, aided by strong singles play

Fans lined the railings of the view-

to cheer on Washington and Lee’s

erals alive, defeating Carnegie Mellon’s

women’s tennis team as they faced
Carnegie Mellon on Saturday.

The Generals fell to the Ti-
tans 2-l during doubles, but came
back to win ﬁve of the six singles
matches. The Generals topped
Carnegie Mellon 6-3 overall.

The match was moved to the
indoor courts after scattered show-
ers soaked the courts minutes be-
fore play was supposed to begin.

It was a rough start for the Gen-
erals, as they dropped two out of
the three doubles matches. The
number 2 combo of Jen Snyder and El-
len Yeatman managed to keep the Gen-

tory! ”

“It felt really great. I
think our excitement was
contagious and enabled the
team to then win ﬁve out
of the six of our singles
matches to secure a solid
6-3” win,” Yeatman said of
their win.

The Generals fought
back during the singles por-
tion of the contest to secure
a victory over their no. 9‘
seeded rivals. Three of the
six singles matches entered
into a third set, causing uncertainty for

the team.

However, all three girls were able to
pull out the win in their matches.

The third—seeded junior Jen Snyder
was the first General to leave the court
with a victory. She effortlessly crushed
her opponent 6-0, 6-0 in record time.

Yeatman said of the contest, “Jen
was on a mission Saturday. She had a
formal to get to so she got on the court
and smanged it to a 6-0, 6-0 victory!

Catherine Reed also easily defeated
her opponent 6-2, 6-0, while Yeatman,
the number one seed, fell to Lauren
Chen by the same score.

The overall win over the Tartans al-
lowed the Generals to end a three-match
losing streak as they head into the end of.
their regular season.

“Most of all, it felt great to ﬁnally

play on our home courts because we had
been travelling for the past four week-
ends,” Yeatman said. “The whole team,
all 18 of us, were able to be there and we
bonded together to take a much needed
win by being each others’ number one
fan.

The women currently post a 13-6
season record, including a perfect 8-0

ODAC record which puts them on top '

of the, conference.

The Generals will hit the court again
on Wednesday where they face Hollins
for their ﬁnal ODAC regular-season
match. Play will begin at 6 p.m.

Basketball team met with cheers during its homecoming to Richmond, aﬁer falling 8th-seeded Butler Bulldogs, 70-62, Sat. night

ASSOCIATED PRESS, 2011

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — About
100 fans welcomed the VCU men’s
basketball team back to Richmond Sun-
day after its Final Four loss to Butler
the night before, ending an unlikely but
magical run in the national tournament.

Fans chanted “VCU, VCU,’-’ as the
team arrived around 3:30 p.m. at the
campus’s Siegel Center near downtown
by police escort. The cheers quickly
turned to “We want Shaka,” referring
to coach Shaka Smart, who ﬂashed a
humble smile as he exited the bus before
the team.

The Virginia Commonwealth Uni-
versity coach and players took their
time going down the line giving high-
ﬁves, hugs and autographs to waiting
fans; who snapped pictures with their
cell phones and cameras.

Gabby and her 6-year-old sister

“I really admire the team,” she said.
Rodriguez said the Richmond

school’s run from a buy-in bid to the na-

Christina Willis, a senior homeland

VCU fans stood behind their team

Patrick Flores, a 2007 graduate, said
he and a group of friends wanted to be
there Sunday to show the team they sup-
ported them until the end. Flores said he
often went to the games, but the school’s
time in the national spotlight has brought
greater pride to the community.

“There’s a lot more pride on cam-
pus, throughout the city of Richmond,
probably in the state of Virginia just for

Joanna Acosta, a 21-year-old biol-

The Washington and Lee men’s lacrosse
team bounced back from last Tuesday’s heart-
breaking loss to Middlebury with a dominat-
ing win over Randolph College on..Saturday.
The Generals beat the'Wildcats by a convinc-
ing 13-4 score, building on their perfect con-
ference record.

The Generals were led on offense by se-
nior attackman Spence Daw, whose hat trick
brought his season total to a team-high 18
goals. He also had one assist, while fellow
attackmen Sam Mott (two goals) and Jack
Switala (two assists) contributed to the Gen-
erals’ productivity.

The rest of the W&L scoring was very
spread out, as eight players combined for the

rest of the eight goals. Four goalies for the

Generals saw action, with a combined four
saves and four goals against.
The win came on the heels of a 6-5 loss
to 7th ranked Middlebury on Tuesday night.
In that game, the Generals got off to a

5-3 lead early in the second quarter after two
goals by Switala, and one goal each by Daw
and sophomore Mac Means, as well as mid-
ﬁelder and captain Drew Koeneman.

However, they were held scoreless the en-
tire second half and Middlebury took the lead
with just over six minutes left.

Despite the ﬁnal score, senior Goalie Ja-
son Lumpkin had a stellar day in the goal,
notching 14 saves as the Panthers outshot the
Generals 42-26.

The biggest loss in the game was that of
sophomore defenseman Joe LaSala, who suf-
fered a knee injury in the ﬁrst quarter. Juniors
Jack Hurley and Jason Harden will be expect-
ed to step up in his absence for future games.

“We lost an important player when Joe
went down,” said fellow defenseman Austin
Wemecke. “We are all hoping that his recov-
ery goes well and we can see him back out
there on the field with us.”

Men 3 lacrosse continues its dominance over conference foes, moves to 4-0 in ODA Cs

winning streak, and the team came back to
Lexington looking to start another run as four
of their last ﬁve games are against ODAC
teams. They started off well against Ran-

to a conference best 4-0.

“Although the Middlebury game would
have been a great win for the program, win-

a step in the right direction.”

The next step for the Generals is against
ODAC rival Roanoke College in Salem on
Wednesday night in what may be the most
important game of the year.

Women continue conference dominance

By Megan Shaw

STAFF WRITER

An incredibly successful week at home for

the Washington and Lee University women’s

lacrosse team leaves them leading the confer-
ence with a perfect '4-0 ODAC record.
Wednesday’s game against Sweet Briar
College was not only marked by head coach
Brooke Diamond’s 50th career victory, but
also celebrated as a shut-out as the Gener-
als controlled the entire game all the way to a

21-0 ﬁnal score.

Approaching the close of her fourth sea-
son as the Generals’ head coach, Diamond is
now 5l-l7 overall and an amazing 27-1 in
ODAC play.

From the minute the clock started, the
Generals immediately dominated the Sweet
Briar Vixens.

F irst-year attackers Katie Hagen, Alex Van
Horn, Kelsey Cotter and Greta Witter took

the goal by storm, all scoring within the ﬁrst
l5 minutes. After an assist, sophomore Ash-g

ley Barnes found the net without fail, making
the score 14-0 with 5 minutes remaining in
the ﬁrst period. .

‘ With only one attempted shot from the
Vixens, senior goal keeper Katharine Farrar
was sure to make the save to keep the ﬁrst
period a shutout.

Though the ﬁnal period was not as goal
heavy, the Generals were more than able to
continue controlling the game. Margaret
Klein, another ﬁrst-year, had already scored
four times in the ﬁrs_t period and continued
her career-best play with two assists in the
ﬁnal period.

This victory was a great way for the
younger players to show their talent, proving
to fans the effect that the ﬁrst-years will have
in years to come.

A 19-10 win on Saturday against Virginia
Wesleyan added to the Generals’ ODAC re-
cord. Their possession ofthe game was not as

 

«.1

Lax records a second 21-0 win, outscoring ODAC opponents 78-20 this season

quick as their victory earlier in the week, and
the teams were battling as the minutes passed
in the ﬁrst period.

Both the Generals and the Virginia Wes-
leyan Marlins fought to keep up with each
other, but it was senior attackers Emmy Mat-
thews and Wilton Megargel who seemed to
push their team and keep control of the game
by each contributing several goals and assists.

After ﬁve uncontested goals, Junior Mad-
die McKaig ﬁnished the ﬁrst period by mak-
ing an unassisted goal with a second remain-
ing to put W&L ahead l0-4. ‘

Megargel opened the second period with a
goal off of a free position shot, but the Mar-
lins came back to score twice within the next
ﬁve minutes. They continued to try to gain
some kind of lead on the Generals, but with
the help of Farrar and her defense, it was im-
possible.

Though Virginia Wesleyan managed to
 score ﬁve goals throughout the ﬁnal
 period, players like Van Horn and
‘‘ Klein attacked the goal to ﬁnish the
game with a ﬁnal score of 19-10.

The No. 14 Generals will play
Bridgewater College on Wednesday at
home, and Farrar is hoping for another
focused victory.

“It will be important for us to stick
 to the fundamentals for the rest of our
' season so that we can ensure the num-
 ber one spot in the ODAC,” she said.
Along with the rest of the W&L com-
munity, Farrar said she has a ton of
conﬁdence in her team.

“I think we are on the right track to
becoming a strong competitor in the
', NCAA tournament later in the spring.”

Convention
kicks off

Former Bush advisor Karl
. Rove keynotes weekend of
events

By Leigh Dannhauser
STAFF WRlTER

The Washington and Lee Mock Convention, con-
sidered one of the most accurate in the United States,
is ﬁnally about to begin. V

This Wednesday marks the start of the kickoff to
the quadrennial event. Kickoff events continue each
evening through Saturday night.

Karl Rove, the event’s keynote speaker, served as
President George W. Bush’s deputy chief of staff. He
is currently a Fox News contributor and a Wall Street
Journal columnist.

Sophomore Juhi Amin is one of many looking for-

~ ward to the kickoff as a whole, but especially Karl
Rove.

“I’m looking forward to the fantastic speakers and
like most of the W&L student body, can’t wait to see
Karl Rove speak” Amin said. She’s additionally ex-
cited because Rove will be speaking on her birthday.

“The band party and BBQ will also be a great op-
portunity for the W&L community to interact and en-
joy spring term,” Amin said.

A lot of work went into bringing Rove to Lexing-
ton, along with the planning of the entire event as a
whole. Members of the steering committee have been
working on kick-off for months. They’ll continue
planning until the actual Mock Convention happens
in February 2012. _

A countdown to the Convention, along with more
information about the convention itself, can be found

Osama bin Laden killed by American forces, President Obama announces

By Eleanor Kennedy
N E w s E D 1 T 0 R «

Washington and Lee students cel-
ebrated with ﬁreworks, triumphant
runs through campus with American
ﬂags, and uniﬁed cheers of “USA!
USA! USA!” as word spread late
Sunday night of the death of Osama
bin Laden.

Bin Laden, the leader of the ji-
hadist al-Quaeda and the mastermind
behind the Sept. ll attacks, has been
a major target of the U.S. War on Ter-
ror for a decade.

Nine years, seven months, and
20 days after that attack, and exact-
ly eight years after’President Bush
declared “mission accomplished,”
President Obama told the nation that
a group of American soldiers had
killed bin Laden in a ﬁreﬁght.

Around 9:45 p.m. Sunday, the
White House announced Obama
would give a public statement. Al-
though the topic was initially un-
known, major news networks and
Twitter feeds reported that Bin Laden
was dead and the U.S. had his body.

By the time Obama’s speech be-
ganjust before i 1:40 p.m., W&L stu-
dents had been celebrating for over
an hour.

Fire-

who was raised on a military base in
Germany and is enrolled in ROTC at
VMI could hardly ﬁnd words to ex-
press her emotion.

“What I wouldn’t give to be back
on the military base with all my
friends and their dads who have been
hunting [bin Laden],” Lowry said.

Celebrations raged across wall at
the Virginia Military Institute, but
cadets declined to comment.

Although Macado’s had already
closed by the time celebrations be-
gan, its employees celebrated on the
bar’s porch.

Macado’s employee Marshall Ol-
szewski said everyone could partake
in the celebration with equal excite-
ment.

“We’ve got a white guy, an Asian
and a Mexican, and they’re all happy
that bin Laden is dead,” Olszewski
said.

While celebrations raged on the
streets, the online community lit up.
Facebook status after Facebook sta-
tus and tweet after tweet announced
the death of bin Laden and included
patriotic messages and song lyrics.

tary base with all my friends and their dads

CHRISTINA LOWRY, ﬁrst—year

Obama’s speech was streamed
live from the White House, as well
as on the Washington Post, the New
York Times and several other news
organizations’ websites.

In his speech, Obama said he
made the capture and/or killing of

    

bin Laden a “top
priority” when he

took ofﬁce two
years ago. _
Intelligence of-

ﬁcials briefed him
on a strong lead in
‘late August which
they continued
to investigate for
the past several
months, Obama
said.

Obama deter-
mined late last

_ week that there was
enough intelligence
to pursue the lead
and he authorized
a “targeted opera-
tion” to ﬁnd and
kill bin Laden.

Earlier in the
day on Sunday a
group ofAmericans
found Obama hiding in a compound
deep inside Pakistan. A ﬁreﬁght oc-
curred, but no Americans were hurt,
according to Obama.

Bin Laden was killed and the
Americans took possession of his
body.

Although Obama called bin
Laden’s death “the most signiﬁcant
achievement to date” in the War on
Terror, he emphasized that this con-
ﬁict is by no means over.

“We must, and will, remain vigi-
lant at home and abroad,” Obama
said.

Obama emphasized the impor-
tance of Pakistan’s assistance with
the operation, calling the event a
“good and historic day” for both
America and Pakistan. He added that
the War on Terror is not and has never
been a war on Islam. Bin Laden was

a mass murderer of many groups,
including Muslims, Pakistanis and
Americans, Obama said.

“His death should be welcomed
by all who believe in peace and hu-
man dignity,” Obama said.

' He also took the opportunity to
remember the victims of the Septem-
ber llth attacks and those who have
fought and died in the years since
then.

“On nights like this one,” Obama
said, “we can say to those families
who have lost loved ones to _al-Quae-
da’s terror, ‘Justice has been done.’”

Virginia have pushed water levels

Tonas tea through southern states

Alabama natives at Washington and Lee feel the eﬂects of massive tornadoes

By Eleanor Kennedy
NEWS EDITOR

Massive tornados and. wind-
storrns ripped through the seven
southeastern states last week, killing
at least 342 people, according to the
Associated Press. Although the dam-
age in Virginia was relatively low,
Washington and Lee students from
hard-hit Alabama have heard plen-
ty of stories of destruction in their
hometowns.

F irst-year Allison Swagler is
from Birmingham, Alabama. Swa-
gler’ said her parents found papers
from Tuscaloosa in their yard from a

ﬁling cabinet that made the 60 mile
journey between cities in the air.

“My parents also found a huge
chunk of a building with a pole
through it,” Swagler said. “It was
scary.”

As scary as the damage was,
Swageler’s family was luckier than
many Alabama residents. The latest
death toll from the storms, according
to the AP, is 250 in Alabama, 35 in
Mississippi, 34 in Tennessee, 15 in
Georgia, ﬁve in Virginia, and one in
Kentucky.

Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox
told the AP that he expects more fa-
talities. Four hundred and thirty-four
people are still unaccounted for in
his city.

The storms also wreaked havoc
on homes and businesses, destroying
5,700 in Tuscaloosa, 2,600 in Mis-
sissippi and 500 here in Virginia.

Although Lexington and Rock-
bridge County avoided direct con-
tact with any of the tornados, the
National Weather Service did issue
a tornado warning for both Rock-

bridge County and Lexington at 1:35
a.m. on Thursday.

According to the weather service,
Halifax County, Farmville, Gooch-
land and western Hanover counties
were all hit with tornadoes.

Bu||itt’s

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

Usually I don’t like to write stories
only about my life. I tried that in high
school, and now I am no longer allowed
back for reunions. Instead, I prefer to
broadly generalize something that re-
lates to my life. This writing process
allows me to utilize an ability I have:
I can say something that seems impor-
tant without really ever saying anything.
And let’s be honest, even when I do say
something important, the people I’m
talking about call it libelous and post my’
article in a computer lab with “Don’t re-
spond to the idiot” written next to it.

However, I had a pretty terrible
weekend, and I think that you the reader
can learn from the two important les-
sons that I learned from my weekend.
Because of these two valuable lessons,
I will rehash my weekend. Warning: if
you do not feeling like me talking about
myself more than usual, just re-read the
other articles in this opinion section,
they are much more quality. Anyway, the
two lessons you should learn from this
story are l) I am a dumbass, and there-
fore, you should not‘ emulate anything I
do, and 2) southern Alabama is one step
above Zimbabwe when it comes to reli-
ability and infrastructure.

This story starts during Spring Break,
when I participated in the annual “W&L
goes to the beach!” migration to Gulf
Shores, Alabama. Never having wit-
nessed that many W&L students outside
of Lexington, I was amused by the week
of events that ensued. By far the most
entertaining was seeing more forced
evictions than gentriﬁcation. By the end
of the week, I saw more homeless people
than the underside of the George Wash-
ington Bridge. But that’s irrelevant.

Towards the end of my stay in Gulf
Shores, my car’s engine decided not to
turn over. Now, at this point I was in no
mood to deal with a dead_ car. I was com-
ing back from the local grocery store,
where the crazy owner would refuse
to sell you alcohol (even at double the
price) if there was anyone below 21 in
a ﬁve mile radius. So, I decided that I
would deal with the problem of a dead
car the next morning.

Waking up with a hangover did not
help my analytical thinking, so instead‘
of calling my parents and asking them
for their AAA card _ number, which
would’ve made »more sense (but I’m

bu|I**itt weekend, in full  

Opinions editor Stockton Bullitt tells a story explaining his utter incompetence and why the South lost the Civil War

an idiot), I borrowed my friend’s card.
Since I am from Connecticut and my
certain friend is from California, I had
to put on my best California accent, so
I mispronounced words and talked like I
had a big nose. The AAA representative
told me that I had an expired card, and I
could only get towed from a service sta-
tion in a three mile radius. Since I was
in Gulf Shores (remember: Zimbabwe
2.0), there was no station remotely close
to where I was, so I ﬁbbed my location,
but only because I didn’t have to sign
any honor code. My ploy worked and
the tow truck came an hour later.

Instead of choosing to bring my
Honda to a Honda dealership 40 minutes
away (remember: I’m dumb), I trusted
the tow truck’s company: Gulf Shores
Auto Service. I met the owner of the re-
pair shop, a 300 pound man in overalls,
and since I am more naive thenHNewt’s
next girlfriend, I instantly trusted him. I
started to describe to him the problem
when my ﬁb came back to haunt me.
The tow truck driver, the owner’s broth-
er, started charging California me for the
towing at the same time as the Connecti-
cut me was giving the owner informa-
tion. Luckily, all I got was a raised eye-
brow following a hurried excuse.

After checking out the car for a day,
the owner called me back the next day to
tell me that my car’s engine was in ma-
jor trouble. The timing chain had been
messed up which disrupted a turning
belt which bent a couple of valves. In
other words, I had no idea what he was
talking about. All I knew.was that my
car was more abused than the San An-
tonio Spurs’ interior defense. The owner
told me that he would need to order parts
to get the car ﬁxed. I gave him the okay
as I left in another car to return home to
W&L. '

The next Monday, I got a call from
the secretary asking if they should order
the parts. I once again gave her the go-
ahead. She told me that there was $2000
in damages, which meant that I spent the
next two hours on the phones with each
of my parents pretending to be interest-
ed in their lives before quickly dropping
my little piece of news at the end of the
conversation. The secretary also told
me that once the parts were in, the re-
pair would be easy. She told me that ev-

"erything would be done by Wednesday,

obscenity.

Thursday latest. I told her that I would
come down that Saturday to pick up my
car and drive it back, and she said that
would be just ﬁne.

And then Spring Term came. I be-
came the latest victim of the adminis-
tration telling professors to make their
classes as hard as possible. Furthermore,
I had other things to worry about: girls
were playing football, Mock Con was

assigning actual work, and the Grizzlies -

were actually beating the Spurs. Re-
member, I am a dumbass, so of course, I
assumed that if there was a problem, the
Gulf Shores Auto Service would tell me.
I booked the plane tickets to Pensacola
without Traveler’s Insurance (Who
needs it?), and somehow I convinced my
girlfriend to join me on a ﬂight down to
beautiful Pensacola and an enticing 14
hour drive back to Lexington. In other
words, I am going to have to spend a lot
more money on her birthday present.

I was going to get a ride to the air-
port on Friday, and then I realized that I
scheduled my ﬂight at the end of Derby
Days, so no one was going to be able to
drive me to the airport if LexPo had any-
thing to say about it. As a result, we took
my girlfriend’s car, and I incurred a nice
parking fee to go along with hotel and
ﬂight plans. The ﬂights were pretty nice,
and the Homewood Suites in Pensacola
was a fantastic hotel, fantastic enough
in fact to mask the fact that Pensacola
is populated only by military personnel
and old people.

As punishment for bringing her on
this trip, my girlfriend made me spend
the next morning watching The Royal
Wedding on TLC no less. About as ex-
citing as a Tim Pawlenty speech,'I ﬁg-
ured that watching someone else’s wed-
ding would be the worst part of my day.
And then I called the Gulf Shores Auto
Service center for the ﬁrst time since the
secretary told me that everything would
be ﬁne by the previous Wednesday. Af-
ter multiple rings, a surly man picks up.
He tells me that the repair shop is closed
on Saturdays, and that he is only doing
service calls. This is news to me. How-
ever, I tell him that I’m only picking up
a car, and he says that I can come by and
he’ll do me a favor and let me get my
car.

Then came the problem of getting to
Gulf Shores. See, Pensacola is over an

hour away from Gulf Shores, and since
Gulf Shores isn’t even in the good part
of Alabama that gets hit by tornadoes,
there is no damn reasonable form of
transport to the city besides a $100 cab
ride. I call a cab and am lucky enough to
have a cabby that literally talks the en-
tire hour plus long drive. He explains to
me about the good old days of hitchhik-
ing, his divorce, his recurring visits to
the doctor over his painful leg and many
other fantastically interesting stories.
As I pass the border of ‘F lorida and Ala-
bama, there is about ﬁfteen minutes of
tralﬁc because, according to the cabby,
there is a yearly party on this weekend
when tens of thousands of people gather
to toss ﬁsh across the border. Apparently,
this is an excuse for a party in this part
of the country. God, I miss civilization.

I ﬁnally arrive at the Gulf Shores
Auto Service station to ﬁnd absolutely
nobody there. I call the guy making
service calls. No answer. I look around-
for a bit and ﬁnd a guy working in the
shop. He tells me that he can’t help me
at all because “he has no money.” Yep, I
was questioning why I was a Democrat
at that moment. I called the guy making
service calls again, and he picked up
only to tell me that he wouldn’t be there
for two hours. Now, I was stuck in a
scene from “Deliverance” for two more
hours. I ﬁnd the repairman who has no
money, point to my car and beg him to
just let me pay him and drive home. He
looks at my car in the lot and says, “Oh
that car. Oh, we haven’t even started
working on that one yet.”

Sorry, what? My heart starts beating
a little faster, and I ask for the owner’s
personal cell phone. I get it and give him
a little call. He tells me that they are still
missing a part because it hasn’t come
in yet, and this prevents them from do-
ing anything to the engine. He says that
once the part comes in the ﬁx should be
easy and asks if I could stick around un-
til Monday to get my car. Since that was
about as likely as Rihanna getting to-
gether with Chris Brown, I told him that
this was the only time I could pick up my
car myself. He said that he had no idea
that I was coming down this weekend.
This is where lessons come in handy for
the story. I was a dumbass for not being
more on top of this earlier and‘ talking to
the owner myself, and the South lost the

Civil War because secretaries don’t have
the wherewithal to either make correct
statements or communicate with their
bosses.

After talking to my girlfriend and my
parents, I ﬁnally turned down the options
of hiring another tow truck to bring my
car to another dealership and/or buying
a machine gun. I ﬁnallyjsettled down by
watching Rachel McAdams’ new movie
“Moming Glory.” Yeah, it’s about as
girly as they come, but I’ll be damned if
I can stay furious while watching Rachel
McAdams cutely struggle to handle her
demanding job and love life at the same
time. I went back to Pensacola with my
girlfriend, booked a 6 am ﬂight, and
drowned my sorrows at Chili’s.

All in all,'having to deal with incom-
petence in both the Deep South and your
own stupidity is pretty frustrating. But,
in the end of the day, that’s why we’re
in college. We are all old enough to have
actual consequences to our failures and
the failures of those around us, but we
still have a support structure around us
protecting us from the worst of these
consequences. I was an idiot for not
cussing out the repair shop earlier, but
I also was able to get a ﬂight home and
eat at a Chili’s that night, which was a
hidden gem in its own right. Still, we are
old enough that we have no excuses for
not learning from ours and others’ mis-
takes, so I hope that you can learn from
my stupidity and Gulf Shores’ lack ofre-
liability and not waste a weekend ﬂying
down to the middle of nowhere only to
not get your car back. Rachel McAdams
won’t always be there to comfort you.

Well, my weekend was pretty bad
until Osama bin Laden died. Let’s go
America!

Feminism and sportsmanship can exist in sorority competition during
Spring Term is Derby Days

By Noel Price
COLUMNIST

Ah, Derby_Days... In a mere week,
girls are pitted against each other to raise
money for the Make-a-Wish foundation
while also showing their fun-loving, do-
mestic, and ferocious natures.

Are these qualities at all contradic-
tory? Of course not! It’s all in good
competition.

But in the midst of the competition, a
few negatives arise which include con-
cussions, broken appendages, derogato-
ry slurs, and ﬁve days of discomfort rid-
ing on Traveller with girls in opposing
sororities. The sidelines of a powderpuff
football game are about the furthest cry
from the inside of a sorority house dur-
ing recruitment week (if you exclude
the inane chanting

how cute and fun we are and how we
currently spend an unbelievable amount
of time as current members displaying
the same to the “ﬁrst-years”. All that lost
in the midst of a hot day, in a dirty tank
top, looking at your former hallmates
and classmates alike with disdain.

In all ofthis lies one ofthe great dou-
ble standards of life as a female. Some
have called Derby Days a crime against
feminism, as we are encouraged to cook
and run around on a ﬁeld to be examined
and laughed at by men.

However, I argue it is a great week
in the life of a ﬁrst-year Greek girl and
a sort of rite of passage as well. It can,
and should, be a time to bond with your

walk away broadcasting their superior-
ity, and the losers walk away with bitter
mumbles about the winners.

Perhaps this word is antiquated, but I
feel a need to work on being much more
ladylike. If we are as internally divided
as we look during Derby Days, how will
unite for anything?

Complaints can be heard in every
part of the world by women trying to be
taken seriously by their male counter-
parts. Women don’t earn as much, they
are judged more on their appearances,
and just because of history, they have
something to prove.

What does aggressively beating an-
other sorority in football prove? Ath-

leticism, maybe, but

that occurs in both
places). But these are
the same exact girls,
underclassmen and
upperclassmen. Why
all the bad blood?
This is the one
time of the year that
girls get to be in
each other’s faces
about the fact that

they made the right

choice. However, playﬁil rivalries have
lost their place behind Pole 3. Somehow,
we have a tendency to turn savage upon
application of paint to faces and sorority
letters to chests.

I am as guilty as the next girl—in .the
heat of the moment, I forget the golden
rule immediately. I ﬁnd myself spewing
hateful things that I didn’t even mean
from the abyss of my subconscious. I
left the ﬁeld on Thursday pretty frustrat-
ed with myself and the things that had
been said by myself and others in the
name of our sororities. All I could think
about was the way we tirelessly worked
as “ﬁrst-years” to show the older girls

The double standard exists not in female partici-
pation in Derby Days, but rather in the manner in

which we have come to participate.

pledge class and waltz around in your
letters like they were branded into your
skin (but of course, they’re not. That’s
hazing and disgusting and‘ we’re not
cows).

The double standardlexists not in fe- —

male participation in Derby Days, but
rather in the manner in which we have
come to participate. Boys and men at
W&L (yes, two distinct categories ex-
ist) are called by our beloved Robert
E. Lee to be gentlemen in every part of
their lives. If they played out their fra-
ternity rivalries on a ﬁeld, I believe both
teams would walk away in good spirits.
When girls play football, the winners

aggressiveness could
be laughed at just as
hard as cowardice.
Neither is ladylike (or
whatever you deem
the female equivalent
of “gentlemanly” to
be). I believe Derby
Days can be a week
of sportsmanship and
camaraderie, and its
competition can be
fair. We must not fall back on the expec-
tation that only men must be gentle, but
as we are on this campus and not going
anywhere anytime soon, women should
be, too.

3 - THE R|NG~TUM PHI-

 

  |et:er*:otheedi:or

Ladies_and Gentlemen:

I am glad my friend Ted Delaney expressed eloquently his concern about the

‘-Speaking Tradition in the March 14 PHI. It has spawned some good conversations

which I hope will continue during Spring Term and beyond.
Some days when I walk around campus, my experience is like Professor Del-
aney’s. The Speaking Tradition seems to be on life support at best, and I am con-

, coined. The next day, more people are speaking, or at least nodding. It seems to

come and go.

Does it really matter? Should we be concerned? Why not realize that things
change and move on? Is it a relic of days gone by? People we speak to (or not) will
notice, but beyond that why should speaking matter to the current W&L generation?
Is it ok to be silent strangers in this small community? V

q Permit me to offer some observations based on my long affiliation with W&
as a student, law student, EC president, ac_tive alumnus, former trustee, and current
member of the administration. To be sure, simply saying hello or waving should not

’-be conﬂated into the singular measure of the strength of this place, or as the most

important barometer of what we do here. It is not the only indicator of civility, or a
Substitute for our genuine feelings and how we treat one another, but I respectfully
submit that the Speaking Tradition is notjust a relic of yesteryear. .

A wise and respected senior professor, who came to W&L years ago from a very
different geographic and cultural setting, once told me how he grew to revere our

» practice of acknowledging each other. This simple act means much more.to him

than saluting the past or just saying hello by rote. It is a valuable ﬁrst step in how
we treat each other, and it supports the core virtue of civility, about which we care
deeply. ‘

Especially when we do it without regard to age, job, appearance or title, it is a

J foundation stone for a broader culture of respect. Speaking says: ‘I acknowledge

you.’ Regardless of who you are, you matter, and I will not just ignore you and walk
on'by. Does this resonate? If so, perhaps it is easier to focus less on speaking as a
tradition and more on simply showing respect for the person right in front of you.

Late president John Elrod was fond of saying that the university community is all
about conversations in and out of the classrooms. The living room in Elrod Com-
mons honors that premise. In what kind of climate will we seek to converse about
important or challenging issues? Is it probable that we will fare better if we are ac-
customed to being civil and promoting a culture of respect? I believe so.

Looking externally, many families and visitors notice us speaking to each other
and to them. Speaking helps create a welcoming atmosphere which is appealing to
promising high school students. It is quite impressive and they say so, as a family
told me ten minutes before I began drafting this letter. Three separate families cited
it when I talked with them on Admitted Students Day. A good friend’s daughter fell
for W&L because a professor saw her walking around, said hello, and engaged her
about academic life at W&L. These stories abound. «

People interviewing for jobs, parents who have entrusted their most valuable as-
set to us, and alumni friends and donors who support W&L and help make it special
also embrace the Speaking Tradition. Exhibit A is the story of Doremus Gym, made
possible by a gift from two strangers to W&L, who were powerfully inﬂuenced by
the simple kindness shown them by a student when they visited our campus.

Alumni of other schools attend our Special Programs campus , symposia ‘and
travel with W&L alumni. Our solicitous attitude impresses and connects them to

' us. Similarly, I travel to various alumni gatherings across the country. Two things

happen pretty regularly. Alumni ask about the Speaking Tradition because they
cherish it. Non-W&L guests will frequently comment favorably on the warmth of
our culture, an attribute which develops during our time together on campus.

A few years ago, I conducted an informal experiment by visiting a peer college.
It had acquired an unfortunate descriptive label, so I wanted to see for myself. In
my 45 minutes walking around the small campus on a pretty day, one person spoke
to me because  asked for directions. No one else spoke or acknowledged me. The
students trudged along with grim faces and heads down; they weren’t talking to each
other either! The campus was without life or excitement, hence its characterization
as ‘a place where joy goes to die.’ Surely we don’t want that phrase to be applied to

. W&L. That is one reason why this fall we will welcome each member of the new

class of 2015 with a shirt which says simply: “Speak.”

These observations lead’ to some simple opinions. We don’t need to be silly or
robotic. No one can speak to 23 people in a row while changing classes. You do
not need to contort your head if you are on a cell,’ but often it is easy to wave or
say hello. It’s a simple and meaningful thing. We can do more of it, I hope we will,
W&L will be better for it, and thousands of alumni and friends who cherish our
Speaking Tradition will be glad to see it on display.

It's notT\/, its gold...

The wonderful shows featured on HBO will give you some much
needed rest from Spring Term

By All Greenberg
co LU M N I sr

I was going to talk about Spring
Term this week, and then I forgot to
write an article.

So after an eventful weekend
of “late nights” and getting “ship-
wrecked-face”, I found myself reliv-
ing my life as a freshman late Saturday
night and watching HBO reruns in the
dorms. This is because I may or may
not have eaten at

show was golden, like silence (take
that Ari Gold). It was as dry as the Sa-
hara and looked like your 6-year old
niece drew it, but it just worked, unlike
when Tim, our protagonist, tried to pay
Debbie the Hooker in meatloaf.

Or Summer Heights High: A “moc-
kumentary” mini-series about a high
school in Australia where it is totally

ed 360 degrees during a raunchy tryst
with a vampire, or see possessed towns
people eating a delicious gumbo made
from human heart. No seriously, this is
obscene stuﬂ° we are dealing with.

Yet, there is much to be praised
about True Blood. The society that is
developed is absolutely fascinating,
ripe with political and social com-

mentary about mis-

D-Hall six times
last week.

Despite the
ever-rising tu-
ition, our school
does not provide
HBO on campus,
so it had been
awhile since I
had watched my
shows. It should .
really be included with 1 room and
board, because without debate, HBO
has the best programming available on
your television set, and I refuse to en-
tertain any claims otherwise.

Past hits are numerous and iconic,
and current programs consistently
bring the awards and the ratings, with
millions ofpeople tuning in every Sun-
day for new episodes.

Even their ﬂops are fantastic when.

compared to cable, and many of the
shows on HBO never even go past one
season, not because they suck but be-
cause one season was enough.

From news shows like Real Time
with Bill Maher to award winning
miniseries like John Adams or Mildred
Pierce, HBO puts in work and produc-
es incredible programs that can appeal
to just about any audience.

I would be ecstatic if you have ever
heard of Life & Times of Tim, but I
won’t be surprised if you haven’t. This

It just worked... unlike when Tim, our protagonist,

tried to pay Debbie the Hooker in meatloaf

acceptable for you to take an entire epi-
sode to ﬁgure out whether it is real or
fake. While not actually an HBO origi-
nal, HBO was genius enough to bring it
to the states a few years ago.

Hilarity ensues when one actor
plays the schools overzealous and
ﬂamingly ﬂamboyant Drama teacher, a
13 year-old Samoan troublemaker and
the Queen Bee private-public school
exchange student Ja’mie. Just Google
“Mr. G” and thank me later.

On the other side of the spectrum
we have True Blood. Which while it
does have its comedic moments, main-
ly thanks to the well-meaning Jason
Stackhouse, it is most deﬁnitely not a
comedy. If you didn’t follow this show
from the very first episode, I beg you
not to try picking it up later. You will
be shocked, disturbed, dazed and con-
fused.

If you tune in at the wrong moment,
you may see a woman’s head be rotat-

understood facets of

humanity.
And then the
Vampire King of

Mississippi rips out
a newscaster’s spine
on live TV.

I could wax poetic
about Curb Your En-
thusiasm, Entourage,
The Wire, Boardwalk
Empire, The Sopranos, Rome, or Big
Love, but I cannot even come close to
doing justice to these programs.

So in conclusion; Sloane is hot,
we get it. Kenny Powers is more of a
man than you will ever be. That guy
on Hung gives it away for free. SATC
(editor’s note: for males, she is refer-
ring to the apparently popular program,
Sex and the City) will never get old, al-
though the women will. And, of course,
it’s not TV, its HBO.

What, exactly, is”lhe Boondocks”?

Sally Platt rationalizes the jokes behind the controversial cartoon

By Sally Platt
COLUMNIST

I had never heard of “The Boon-
docks” until a few weeks ago. I’m not
sure how I managed to miss out for so
long on such a sweet show, but there
you have it. I found out about the car-
toon when someone asked me to ﬁll
out a survey for a psych class about
race relations in The Boondocks.

I thought she was referring to The
Boondock Saints so I went ahead
and filled out the survey. I got a little
stumped when I got to the question
“How do you think the cartoon is por-
traying black people?” because there
are no black people in The Boondock
Saints, a movie about thelrish maﬁa.
But I went ahead and answered the
question anyway. Ofcourse I later re-
alized my mistake and decided I bet-
ter check out what the real show was
about. _

Wow. The Boondocks is just very
“wow” at ﬁrst. I mean if we’re talking
politically incorrect, the show has it
all. Stereotypes, cuss words, all those
things were not allowed to talk about
in normal society, all of these appear
in the show. It was actually sort of
refreshing. Mostly though it was just
horrifying.

I watched the ﬁrst episode by myself
and didn’t catch any of the humor. As
I sat back after it ended, I couldn’t be-
lieve that this was something allowed
to be aired on TV. Then I watched it
again with people and when they were

laughing at all the worst (best?) parts I
reassessed and started to see some of
the humor that has made this show one
of the most talked about cartoons since
it came out in 2005.

Really, the show is more contested
than talked about. Its three seasons

[have created quite a buzz. Rever-

end Al Sharpton said in response to
one episode, “Cartoon Network must
apologize and also commit to pulling

‘episodes that desecrate black historic

ﬁgures.” This particular episode had
satirized Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
The producer, Aaron McGruder, said
that this was done in a spirit of humor
and meant rather to satirize incor-
rect responses to the great civil rights
leader than criticize the man himself.
He said Sharpton had missed the joke.

That is the hard thing about The
Boondocks: it is so easy to miss the
joke. Everything is offensive and so
everything must be funny (and really
is). Occasionally, however, it can make
you feel kind of guilty to be laughing
at the jokes. Isn’t the show rather en-
forcing these stereotypes of African-
American culture?

As the producers tackle subjects
like Barack Obama’s presidency, BET,
gangsta rap, civil rights, R. Kelly, graf-
ﬁti art and beyond, are they taking it
too far? Perhaps, but what is important
is that the show is making people talk.

Contentious comedy can often have

this effect. For this reason, comedy has
for a long time been used to inﬂuence
politics. Through its veil of laughter,
comedy can say things that can’t be
said out in the open. After all, how
can people get mad when it’s all only
a joke?

The Boondocks may be a joke, but
what it is accomplishing is not. It is
making people face issues that other--
wise might be swept under the table.
Not just issues of African American
culture but problems in America as a
whole. The show is bringing these out
into the open where they can be dis-
cussed. And isn’t realizing that there is
a problem the ﬁrst step in solving it?

So while The Boondocks may anger
many people it serves an important so-
cial function. But more than that, the
show just makes us laugh. And couldn’t
we all do with a few more chuckles,
giggles and ho-ho’s? So here’s to hop-
ing there will be a Season 4. Oh and
while I’m here I’d like to apologize to
the person who’s psych survey I took.
Hope my response didn’t mess up your
results too much!

Dressed up in their preppiest sundresses and ﬂoppiest hats, Washington and Lee students bask in the spring day. Foxﬁelds, an annual horse race in Charlottesville, has become a
popular destination for members ofthe Greek community from UVA and other nearby schools.

Sundresses and bowties and more: students travel an hour away to the “biggest frat party ever” in Charlottesville

ByDaneDavis
STAFF WRITER

Most college students would be ap-
palled at even the idea of waking up be-
fore 8 a.m. on a Saturday. But it’s spring
term, so Washington and Lee students
are willing to invest a day to socialize
and experience an unique event. This
weekend, instead of spending the Satur-
day in the great LexVegas, some W&L
students decided to wake up much ear-
lier than usual to drive to Charlottesville

Rusted Root

Managing editor reviews the concert, gives

thumbs up to GAB

By Diandra Spicak
MANAGING EDITOR

Last Thursday, the Generals Activi-
ties Board hosted yet another musical
act ~ and this time for free. Headlining
the night, the Pittsburgh band Rusted
Root played to a sparsely ﬁlled Pavilion,
but that didn’t seem to stop the nineties

< band of “Send Me on my Way” fame

(think Matilda and Ice Age).

Unfortunately, I spent too much time
at Derby Days to make it in time to see
The New Mastersounds, but, let me tell
you, Rusted Root did not disappoint. I,
along with many in the audience (just
an assumption here), only knew of the
uplifting song about growing up. How-
ever, “Send Me on my Way” was not the
best ofthe set-list at all that evening.

Channeling a folk and bluesy sound,
with a fusion ofAfrican, Native Ameri-
can and Latin American percussive
inﬂuences, Rusted Root had nearly
everyone dancing, jumping and sway-
ing to their music. Using a multitude
of percussion instruments, including
bongos and (surprise!) a washboard,
the band kept the momentum and the
mood high. The show, overall, was high
energy — the audience could not stop
moving, from swing dancing to various
rave-inspired movements (someone had
what looked like, to me, light up yo-yos
and was spinning them behind the audi-
ence). ‘

While the audience called for Rusted
Root to “send them on their way,” the
highlights of the night included some
of their newer material. “Dance in the

to watch the F oxﬁeld horse races.
Students dedicated enough to this
adventure, woke up Saturday morning
and quickly changed into exceptionally
preppy attire consisting of sundresses,
Sunday-afternoon hats, button-down
shirts, and maybe a bowtie. The Lee stu-
dents drove for about an hour to this fes-
tival ioutside of Charlottesville. These
students found themselves in the middle

Middle,” a bluegrass jam song, featur-
ing the washboard, particularly stood
out for me — in fact, it was the single
from their newest album, Stereo Rodeo! .

And, those in attendance were able
to hear three unreleased songs. Chatting
with the band after the show, I found out
these few songs have yet to be recorded.
The members were affable and conge-
nial, speaking to everyone that came up
to the merch table (I even scored a photo
with two of my friends). Walking out, I
looked at my srat sister and we were un-
able to hold back our smiles (mind you,
we, even though attending Derby Days
merely hours before, were not intoxicat-
ed). The ride back was littered with ex-
clamations of “that was the best concert
l’ve ever been to on campus!”

“That was so much more fun than
Wale!”

“And no one left after the one song
everyone knew!”

So, a round of applause for Rusted
Root and for GAB’s hosting them. De-
spite a small audience turnout, I would
call this latest concert 21 success. The
biggest plus? It was free A but, after the
music I heard, I would’ve gladly paid
$10.

The band kept the energy of the
crowd up by playing fast~paced
music — with interesting instru-
ments (like the washboard on the
right).

of a circular track watching horses and
jockeys gallop around on an attractive
spring day.

University of Virginia students have
turned these horse races into a Greek af-
ﬁliated social event by setting up many
large tents with refreshments and food.
The few W&L students who did attend
the event had the opportunity to social-
ize with students from other universities.

Leaving the Lexington bubble to
go to what has been referred to as the
“biggest frat party ever” by Katie Jar-
rell via twitter, made the students of our
university feel at home. After watching
the races with the well dressed crowd,
the students had to make their trek back
to Lex. And, in order to leave the grass
ﬁeld, students had to get in a long line of

traffic leading to the picturesque high-

performs a Paon

way.

In short, the Foxﬁeld races provide
a nice, yet familiar, diversion to the ev-
eryday Lexington life. New friends are
made, and the spring weather is enjoyed
- all a short drive away from W&L.

tical path last weekend as they
both claimed a 5-0 victory over
Hampden—Sydney College in
Lexington on Saturday, earn-
ing the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference title.

This year marks the 30th
conference title W&L men
have won and their second con-
secutive title; the conference
has been recognizing a cham-
pion for only 35 years.

Similarly, the women have‘

now claimed 10 consecutive
ODAC titles, making this their
21st title in the 26 years that
W&L women have been com-
peting.

On Saturday, the team won
all three of their doubles match-
es. Juniors Jonathan Gaffney

and Mac Davis paired up at No.
1 doubles to win 8-4, while ju-

nior Brian Roberts and sopho-

more Hayden White combined
at No. 2 to also win with a score
of 8-4.

At the No. 3 position, ju-
niors Jeremy Becht and Mi-
chael Freeman teamed together
to win 8-2. '

For singles play, Becht,
playing at the No. 2 position,
defeated his opponent 6-1, 6-2,
and Roberts won his match

‘6-2, 6-2 while playing at the

No. 6 position. The rest of the
singles matches were called off
because W&L had already se-
cured victory by winning the
ﬁrst ﬁve matches.

'The win gives the men a
l5-3 overall record on their
season. » '

The men will receive an au-

tomatic bid into the NCAA Di-
vision III Tournament because
of their conference title. The
national tournament begins on
May 13, but the team will play
again on May 7 when they go
to 12th-ranked North Carolina
Wesleyan to end their regular
season. That match will begin
at 1:00 pm.

The eighth—ranked women,
who held the top seed in the
ODAC tournament, won in
similar fashion.

Juniors Trelsie Sadler and
Lauren Lukas won 8-2 play-
ing at the No. 1 doubles spot,
and fellow juniors Ellen Yeat-
man and Jen Snyder took their
match 8-3 at the No. 2 spot.

Junior Ann Morris teamed
with senior Catherine Reed
at the No. 3 team to win their
match 8-4.

In singles play, Sadler and
Reed each brought in a 6-0, 6-0
victory in their matches while
playing at the No. 4 spot and
the No. 6 spot, respectively.
The rest of the matches were
called off.

The women now have 18-6
overall record for their season.

Like the men, the women
have earned an automatic bid to
the NCAA Tournament which
starts on May 13. Unlike the
men, the victory over Hamp-
den-Sydney marked the end
of their regular season, so the
team will return to play at the
national tournament.

Lax defeats and destroys

W&L women Continue conference domination as they take down their ﬁnal opponents

By Jayna Johns
SPORTS EDITOR

Washington and Lee’s wom-
en’s lacrosse team ﬁnished con-
ference play this week in the
same fashion it had been play-
ing all seasonz complete domi-
nation.

The No. 15 Generals defeat-
ed Randolph—Macon College
last Saturday 18-8, and then
destroyed Randolph College on
Thursday with a score of 22-1
to notch a perfect 8-0 confer-
ence record. The team now has
an 11-4 overall record for the
season.

Senior Emmy Mathews led
the team in scoring against
Randolph-Macon, making six
goals and recording a new ca-
reer high. Mathews scored her
ﬁrst goal of the day just 17 sec-
onds after play had begun.

The women jumped out to
a 6-0 lead before R—MC got on
the board, aided by two more
goals from Mathews, two by
senior Wilton Megargel and a
score by junior Alli Shearin.

' ‘The Yellow Jackets man-
aged to put in two goals con-
secutively to get within four
points, but this was the clos-
est they would get for the resf

of the game. The Generals an-
swered with four more goals,
with two coming from Megar-
gel, and one from Mathews and
junior Maddie McKaig.

« R—MC managed one more
goal in the ﬁrst half, while the
Generals put in another four to
go into the break leading 14-3.

The Generals gave up two
consecutive goals to open the
second half, but responded by
netting three consecutive shots
and gaining a 12-point advan-
tage, their largest of the game.
First-years Alex Van Horn and
Meade Brewster each contrib-
uted one of the shots, and se-
nior Kate Donnelly added the
third.

The Yellow Jackets got
hot in the ﬁnal minutes of the
game, putting in three straight
shots, but there was no way for
them to overcome their deﬁcit.
The game marked the seventh
straight W&L victory over

Randolph-Macon.

Megargel ﬁnished the game
with a total of four goals, Van
Horn and Shearin each made
two, and McKaig, ‘Donnelly,
Brewster, and ﬁrst-year Mere-

W&L senior Emmyivlathews made eight goals throughout the week, includinlg
con, contributing to an 18-8 victory over R-MC and a 22-1 victory. over Rando ph College.

dith Lavin all added one. McK-
aig led the team with three as-
sists, while Van Horn had two
and Mathews had one.

Senior keeper Alex Flam-
mia played every minute of the
match in the net and recorded
10 saves for the day.

The following Thursday,
Randolph College never stood
much of a chance as 14 differ-
ent W&L players scored at least
one goal

Mathews again scored ﬁrst
for the Generals, netting an
assist from sophomore Eliza-
beth Bucklee. The WildCats,
who were unable to record a
conference victory this season,
responded with a goal of their
own a few minutes later to tie
the match.

Randolph’s quest to make
the game competitive was shut
down, however, as the Gener-
als proceeded to put in 13 more
goals before the end of the half.

The second half was more of
the same, but this time without
the WildCat goal. W&L net-
ted eight goals to ﬁnish with a
21-point victory. Amazingly,
this ties with two other games

for the team’s largest margin
of victory on the season, as
the women recorded 21-0 wins
over Hollins and Sweet Briar.
Senior Katharine Farrar and
sophomore Alex Hamill took
turns in the net, each recording
one save. Randolph’s lone goal
managed to get by Farrar.
McKaig led the team in
points, putting in four goals.

Bucklee, Mathews, Lavin,

sophomore Ashley Barnes, and
ﬁrst-year, Katie Hagen each
made two; Brewster, Donnelly,
Shearin, senior Kate Speare,
and ﬁrst—years Kerstin Hjelm,
Kelsey Cotter, Margaret Klein
and Greta Witter all contributed
one.

Bucklee led with three as-
sists while Brewster and Don-
nelly had two. Van, Horn, Klein,

.Mathews, Megargel and Shea-

rin each also had an assist. '
The Generals will play again
on Wednesday in Lexington as
they face Virginia Wesleyan in
the ﬁrst round of the" ODAC
championships.

_Bush_ advisor Karl Rove delivers keynote address F

, By Leigh Dannhauser

STAFF WRITER I

Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff

for President George W. Bush and now

a Fox News contributor, addressed the
VWashingt_on and Lee community last Sat-
urday evening as the keynote speaker for
the 2012 Mock Convention kickoff week-
"end." ‘ 1’

Students, faculty, alumni, parents and
other community members ﬁlled nearly all
the seats on Lee Chapel lawn for Rove’s
speech.

F Rove opened with advice on how to
Jimderstand the upcoming election.

'_ "To look at the coming election, you
need to look at the recent past” Rove said.
‘ Rove was alluding to the gains-that the
‘Republican Party made during the 2010
‘fmidterrn elections. He said that these gains
ﬁjwere‘ made because the independent voters
ijcaine out for Republicans over dynamic
‘-issues such'as the stimulusibill.

 Rove spent. much of his speech on
—.President Qbama’s stimulus bill. Rove
pointed out what he considers discrepan-

7'cies:jbetween the realities of the bill and
how it’s‘ beendescribed.

» V“Every single promise made about this
-bill is -turning‘-,‘out notto be true,” Rove
said. '   ”  A

",Rbve also cited. health care reform as
."‘,ax1‘a:rea where Obama has not delivered
bwhat hepromised.

According to Rove, although Obama

promised no taxes:-on health care for in-

: dividuals, taxihg health care companies
led them to jack up their prices. In the end,

 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 

Rove said, consumers were still hurt.

Audience members had differing view-
points on what Rove had to say, especially
about the stimulus plan.

At least one student said the speech felt
like “a rant against the stimulus bill.”

First-year Liz Olson disagreed.

“He made a good point in addressing
the unnecessary parts of the plan and how
the title is deceiving” Olson said, referring V
to Rove’s claim that the bill is actually a ‘
spending bill.

, Although most of his speech focused
on Obama’s policies, Rove did address the  
upcoming election. '

“Who will be the Republican nominee?
l have no idea” he said. J

Rove continued to say that this Repub-
lican nomination is going to be different
because, for the first time in decades, there
is no “front runner” among the Republi-
cans.

Whoever the Republican nominee will
be, Rove said, he (or she) has three main
challenges to face.

The nominee must prove why Obama
should no longer be president and why he
should be instead. He must both unify the
party and reach outside its ranks. Most im-{
portantly, Rove said, there must be some
moment where the future nominee proves
he can handle thepresidency.

No matter who the Republican nomi-
nee is, Rove said the 2012 election will be
“one of the most consequential in Ameri-
can history.”

How sweet it is.‘ famous cakemaker designs realistic Colonnade cake for students to enjoy at convention kickoﬂ BBQ -

By Valaree Tang
s TA F F w R I T E R

A cake created by the bakery fea-
tured in the Food Network show “Ace of
Cakes,” was one ofthe highlights oflast
weekend’s spring kickoff festivities.

The red velvet-ﬂavored cake was
molded in the shape of the Colonnade,
with ﬁve political ﬁgures on the Colon-
nade lawn, including Sarah Palin and
Donald Trump. The main cake was also
supplemented by one lemon-berry sheet
cake and one mudslide sheet cake.

Wanting to get publicity outside the
traditional newspaper, Mock Con Media
and Communications Chair Kali McFar-

 

land contacted Charm City Cakes.

“One of the approaches that my co-
chair, Katie Stewart, and l were looking
for this year is to take publicity outside
of the traditional political newspapers
and blogs so that they can focus on the
natural lifestyle aspect of the conven-
tion,” said McFarland.

McFarland’s interest in Southern Liv-
ing and the Cooking Channel were inspi-
rations for contacting Charm City Cakes
and working with the bakery to create a
special cake for Mock Con.

Though McFarland did not work

fl’
vim created by Gharm ﬂc-akes of "Ace of C-akes” fame. "

‘directly with Duff Goldman, the man

responsible for the success of “Ace of
Cakes,” she corresponded with general
manager Mary Alice over the phone and
email.

McFarland and Stewart decided on a
cake resembling the Colonnade because
they wanted something that was repre-
sentative of Washington and Lee.

“We wanted something that was
iconic ‘W&L, and we wanted something
that would be special to the convention,”
McFarland said. “The Mock Con logo
this year is the Colonnade with elephants

ﬂanking either side of it, so we thought
‘What’s more iconic than the Colon-
nade and the fact that it tied in with the
logo?”

The cake was served during the bar-
beque, which featured pulled pork sand-
wiches, veggie burgers, baked beans,
salad, coleslaw, watermelon and cook-
ies. . _

General Chair Tricia King, Political
Chair Zach Wilkes and Personnel Chair
Tucker Pribor participated in the cere-
monial cake cutting during the barbeque.

Student response to the cake was

mixed. Some barbeque attendees seemed
to be less than impressed with the cake.

“The cake features detailed work,'but
I thought that it was going to be bigger,”
said Lauren Laskowski.

Other students thought that the “Ace
of Cakes” cake was a “good use of
funds” and “money well spent.”

The barbeque in which the cake was
featured was part of a new revamped
spring kickoff event which included a
band party in Red Square that featured
two bands.

Stereotyping the W&L cultu re  

Our opinions editor examines the nuances tied to campus, singling out some of the unspoken, yet accepted, behaviors

By Stockton Bullitt

It’s notmuch of anopinion to say that Washington and Lee is a pretty unique school. I mean, just look at Spring Term. What other school has anApril Spring Break (in case you haven’t noticed, we have the same

a dead guy buried in our backyard, our courageous support of dodgeball in the face of tragedy and our unquestioned support for an annual Marchprorn that comes in thelform of Fancy Dres's.However, some of our
little nuances can comein-bad forms. For example, we are deﬁnitely the only liberal artsschool that can have empty seats at a Karl Rove speechfor apathy rather than protest. Hey,-at least we loved the cake from a

Food Network show that no longer exists!-_A.nyway, I documented some of these nuances that are unique to W&L culture. These are b_y’no_ means emblematic of the entire population of W&L students, but there g ‘
are distinct trends that Ighaverseen over my three years herein Lexington. If you don’t think that what I’m writing is entirely accurate, feel free towrite in and callme out on it. Since there isonly one more

this is empirical research. _ I . .

So without further ado, here are some nuances and types of people unique to W&L with elite phrases attached to them. Think of this as your own personal stereotyping of W&L, And yes, I know that I’m contribut-
ingto the degradation of our school’s culture, but let’s be honest, there’s‘a reason I save the nasty articles for the Spring Term issues: nobody bothers to read them because tubing is just too damn fun. :

Skull Givers

The name for the chasers of Phi Kap
men. Every fraternity has their respec-
tive fan club, but no fan club follows
their fraternity with the same dedication
and fervor as the Skull Givers. I don’t
know whether it’s the culture of the
school or simply these girls’ upbringing,
but there is something about the com-
bination of long hair, brightly colored
lacrosse shorts, no shirt, and the Pole 4
porch that makes these girls extremely
attracted to the Phi Kap men.

These girls come in two distinct
breeds. Both breeds blend together
during the few times when attention is
given to them by the Skulls. When they
are given the attention they deserve, the
Skull Givers get a rush of joy equal to
that of a kid on a Christmas morning.
To launch a water balloon off the Pole
4 porch is deﬁnitely a highlight of their
college careers.

However, these two distinct breeds
show their true nature when they are ig-
nored. The ﬁrst of these breeds chooses
to give all their love and attention to a
“lesser being.” This love is genuine and
wonderful when the breed is alone with
the lesser being. However, once they’re
at a party with the desired Skulls, the
lesser beings suddenly turn into fumi-
ture more ignored more than Dupont’s
study carrels. \

The other breed of Skull Givers are
the ones who, regardless of how ignored
they are, stick religiously by Phi Kap
through thick and thin. These girls are
willing to spend entire parties listen-
ing to the bros converse among them-
selves, happy to stand on the periphery .
of the conversation. These girls tap on
the shoulders of their prey and have
the same efficiency of getting their at-
tention as these boys do of hitting any-

thing substantial when they launch wa-
ter balloons. That is, the girls are often
ignored. But they always succeed in the
end because anyone who can stand to
watch ﬁst pumping while naked boys
ﬂaunt their business in the backyard de-
serves proper attention.

Mid-level Fantasy ,

This is the name for the group of
guys from mid-level fraternities (Beta,
Phi Psi, Pi Phi, Fiji, Sigma Chi, etc.)
who have a much higher opinion of
themselves than they probably should.
If you confront them about this fact,
they will smile and say, “Naw, we just
like to keep to ourselves and drink in
our own house.” They will say this like
it’s a good thing, when in fact, that is
just a nice way to say they’re into binge
drinking. These guys are the types of
frat stars who agree to socialize with a
certain sorority with whom they don’t
usually hang out. And instead of sim-
ply settling for a nice, little social, these
Fantasy Frat Stars take the reins and turn
the social into an all-day affair, located
at a sorority girl’s house but run by the
fraternity. This party is advertised as a
campus-wide affair, but in reality it’s a
chance for these Fantasy Frat Stars to
have a ﬁve keg party for themselves at
someone else’s house. The actual party
may not have that many people, but at
least these Fantasy Frat Stars can live in
their own little worlds of social success.

Sigma Chi Phase

This is more or less an extinct part
of W&L, so I feel free commentating
on it. For the last few years, every guy
would go through a Sigma Chi Phase
for at least two weeks during their ﬁrst
semester in Lexington. Now, obviously
most guys will never admit to being

completely infatuated with Sigma Chi
for at least a little part of their Freshman
Fall, but deep down, every guy reading
this remembers the time they told their
friends, “Hey, say what you want about
Sigma Chi, there is no better party than
Pole 3.” This was before they discov-
ered the wonder of Windfall and before
they realized that Sigma Chi was not the
center of the fraternal universe at W&L.

This is no longer the case with W&L.
Sigma Chi has joined the rest of the fra-
temity landscape and has appealed to
their speciﬁc niche of W&L student.
Now, contented with their lot, the Sigma
Chi Phase has vanished only to be re-
placed by the KA phase. This phase ap-
peals to the freshman girl more so than
a freshman boy, as an opinion writer so
beautifully illustrated with graphs and
data in an earlier article. KA has nioved

' away from epitomizing the Southern

fraternity, a title they left to SAE, in
favor of appealing to the broader base
of freshman girls and boys whose last
names sound like items on the Salemo’s
menu. Now, every freshman girl enters
their KA phase during Orientation Week
and leaves it...wait, have they gotten
over that phase yet? Note: I know that
KA will be extremely mad that I’m de-
scribing them in this sense. They will
probably try to pick a ﬁght with me the
next time I try and change the song at
a party they are not hosting. But, am I
really insulting you that much by say-
ing that freshman girls love you? Think
about it.

”Late Night”

Thanks to noise ordinances instituted
in Rockbridge County, the term “Late
Night” has a unique deﬁnition to W&L
students. For other schools and even

,in most cities, the term “Late Night”
means 2 in the morning or later. A few
years ago, “Chi Psi Late Night” was
understood to be a party attended once
the clock struck one. However, thanks to
LexPo, W&L’s version of “Late Night”
refers to 11:30. Personally, I don’t think
that the term “Late Night” should be
used while Wendy’s is still open, but
here we are. I know grandmothers that
are awake during our version of “Late
Night,” but with LexPo’s help, we’ll
soon be calling it “Late Night” once the
sun goes down.

W&L Relationship

Seen by many adults here as the de-
mise of modern society, the W&L rela-
tionship is evident all around campus.
The W&L relationship can easily be de-
ﬁned as a relationship in which both par-
ticipants do not see each other or inter-
act with each other during most hours of
the day. The interaction can start during
pre—games for parties, but usually ends
up with ﬁrst meetings during the actual
party and true affection only manifest-
ing itself drunkenly on the dance floor.
Once the party hits midnight, the rela-
tionship is in full swing, and the two
participants are truly intertwined in
love. If this is an experienced relation-
ship, a party will not be complete until
the ﬁrst loud ﬁght breaks out between
the two causing friends of both parties to
roll their eyes and attempt to diffuse the
situation. The night is ultimately spent
together and sometimes, maybe, morn-
ing brunch is shared, but by noon, these
two participants in the W&L relation-,
ship are alien to one another. The only’
reference to their nighttime lovers oc-
curs during gossip sessions with friends,
otherwise these couples do not interact
in any way while the sun is up and work
is to be done.

The W&L relationship usually works
ﬁne for both parties involved until it
comes time to break up. The boy usually
initiates the breakup by treating the girl
at night like he usually treats her during
the day. In other words, he completely
ignores her entire existence at parties
the same way he ignores her entire ex-
istence on the hill. The boy tends to act
clueless whenever this girl’s name is
mentioned, and the girl tends to take out

7,

her frustrations on some unsuspecting
dance floor victim. These speculative
relationships and subsequent breakups
are widespread enough to be described
thusly by one senior: “every single one
of my friends has gotten broken up with
without being in a relationship.”

Speculative Hatred

Admittedly, this is more of a general
college trend, rather than something
speciﬁc to W&L. Still, there is plenty of
speculative hatred that goes around. Ev-_
eryone has had this circumstance occur
in their own respective gossip circles.
One of your friends comes in to lunch
one day exasperated telling you how
much they hate a certain person for a
legitimate reason. Your friends, being
supportive of their ally, support that
person’s claim. Then, over the course of
the next few weeks, friends start trash-
ing the now hated person for acts that he
or she did or did not commit. Soon, the
gossip circle has a hatred bubble for this
person, and there is seething hatred for
a person who probably has only com-
mitted one or two social indiscretions.
The trend is completed when someone
in your circle begins the conversation
by saying, “You know, Hated Person re-
ally isn’t so bad.” And thus, the bubble
is burst when the entire group starts now
sharing anecdotes about how saintly the
formerly evil person is. The comical
part of this whole process is how oblivi-
ous ‘Hated Person is to the entire event.

On another note, it’s very interesting
to see how quickly the Terrorism Bubble
burst in 2011. With the death of Osama
bin Laden and the Arab Spring, it’s now
not a great time to be a terrorist. Back
in the mid-2000s, terrorism was so big
that even people from rural Alabama
were signing up (no, seriously, that
happened), and now the 2011 terrorist
sector looks a lot like the 2008 hous-
ing market. I’m so glad I shorted ter-
rorism in 2010, and I ﬁnd it incredibly
interesting that Pokemon would outlast
terrorism. Enough terrorism jokes? Yes?
Moving on...

Rabbhs

You know that guy in your frater-
nity who only eats salad and gasps at
the mere mention of fried food? Well,
he is your fratemity’s rabbit precisely
because he eats like one. This guy’s
idea of exercise is the Stairrnaster, and
his idea of pigging out is eating a hard-
boiled egg. Everyone has a friend who
abhors Taco Bell and is even resistant to
Subway. You can make fun of him all
you want, but he is usually more ripped
than the guy in the Real World who was
on Frat Pad, so just know that while you
call him a rabbit, he’ll be laughing all
the way to his next hookup.

Diamond in the Rough
Freshmen don’t know this yet, but
during the rush process, there is quite a
bit of judging that goes on in the frater-
nities and sororities. The Diamonds in
the Rough are those freshmen who are
at ﬁrst most debated and fought over.
Half of the Greek organization ﬁrmly
believes that if this person is admitted,
the world will most surely collapse and
the social standing of the respective
Greek organization will crumble in the
process. However, from Tear Night on,
these Diamonds in the Rough are the
coolest members of the Greek organiza-
tion. All their qualities that didn’t shine
during rush now come out in full bloom,
and they are respected and adored by
their peers. Every Greek organization
has one of these, and most likely they
each have their respective Enrons (the
members who were liked only for rush
and at no other points in their career),
but the Diamonds in the Rough are the
ones who are remembered and celebrat-
ed. They are the ones who represent the
best defense for Greek life at W&L: the
chance to befriend someone who you
normally would never befriend.

Wheel Friend

When relationships venture outside
the W&L relationship, friends inevita-
bly get dragged into the process. If you
are ‘single in the later years of your W&L
career, hanging out casually usually en-
tails being the odd numbered member of
a group. If you had three good friends
before, then you will inevitably ﬁnd
yourself serving as the seventh wheel to
your friends, who are now respectively
wife’d up. Every time you want to go
out to dinner or watch a movie, you need
to check with your friends ﬁrst to make
sure that their boyfriends or girlfriends
are available to join your group. This
provides pressure on you to get wife’d
up and can delay your plans mightily.

Drunk Alter Egos

After more than a couple of drinks
on a party night, many people at this
school lose their own personalities and
replace them with their drunken alter
egos. Many people have given speciﬁc
names to these alter egos (for example
if your name is Bill, calling your alter
ego Dan), some use a play of words on
their name (for example, if your name is
Autumn, calling your alter ego Winter)
and others simply just spell their names
backwards to describe their alter egos
(e.g., Haram). However, the most com-
mon way to describe the drunken alter
ego is simply to describe him or her as
“Drunk [insert name here].” The alter
ego tends to be a littlelworse at walk-
ing in a straight line and much worse at
making decisions regarding those of the
opposite sex.

Spring Term Fat Chicks/ Spring

Term Alcoholic

This was not an idea proposed by
me, so before you break out the Student-
Faculty Hearing Board, this is a term a
group of senior girls used to describe
themselves‘ at a certain birthday party.
Not looking to be libelous, I’m using
their description of this term as my deﬁ-
nition. See, these girls are free from the
bondage of academia and are celebrat-
ing by consuming either a lot of food or
a lot of booze and sometimes both.

The Spring Term Fat Chicks are
not Powderpuff linemen, but rather are
healthy girls who are venturing to places
like Frank’s for the ﬁrst time, and there-
fore think of themselves as incredibly
fat for trying a cheese—steak for the ﬁrst
time. Considering W&L’s ostensible
lack of an obesity problem, I guess eat-
ing your ﬁrst mozzarella stick in Spring
Term of your Senior Spring in this cul-
ture makes you a Spring Term Fat Chick,
but when I eat the other ﬁve mozzarella
sticks, I somehow am exempt from be-
ing called the Spring Term Fatass.

The Spring Term Alcoholic describes
the senior girl who has all but graduated
and now celebrates by going on a four
week hiatus from sobriety. This celebra-
tion does not make her resemble Nicho-
las Cage in “Leaving Las Vegas,” but
rather produces a socialite who lives by
a few select mantras. 1) “Every day is
either a bad day or an Occasion.” If the
day is a bad day, then you will need to
drink to cheer yourself up, and if the day
is an Occasion (i.e., someone’s birthday,
Osama’s death day, Star Wars Day, etc.),
then you have to drink to celebrate. 2)
“Everything revolves around the next
drink.” Although thinking like this for
longer than Spring Term will get you
into rehab, the Spring Term Alcoholic
does not worry about books or drama
or tests, but instead worries about what
kind of fruitjuice to mix with what kind
of alcohol. 3) “The sun and loss of ap-
petite [from too much drinking] are a
draining duo.” Tanning and drinking
are contact sports that can wipe you out.
Make sure that you eat even when you
are full and wear plenty of sunscreen.
4) “Stairs are HARD.” When you can
think like this, you know you are having
a pretty good Spring Term.

It’s Spring Term; it’s time forjerseys

Columnist Patrick Smith explains the warmer weather fashion choice, choosing the “dankest ” sports jerseys I

By Patrick Smith
c o L U M N I S T

I sit in my disgusting house recuper-
ating the moming after a Red Square
party while watching Armageddon on
TV. What sounds better than that? A
list of dank jerseys I have compiled, per-
haps? I made this list with many things
in mind, such as on-ﬁeld performance
and overall swag.

If you read one of my past articles
titled, “Brocabulary,” you would under-
stand what the word dank means.

The reason I decided to make this list
is because when I’m not spending my
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday classi-
fying the hell out of some plants in Field
Botany, -I’m wearing sweet jerseys and
trying to get sunbumed so I’m not white
as shit. I can’t help it; I’m a struggling
day-walker.

If you want an idea of what I’m go-
ing for before you read this list, I am
currently wearing a Penny Hardaway-
Warriors jersey. Get at my level. I lifted
this one from a friend who left it at my
house. However, I know for a fact that
he doesn’t read my “crappy” articles, so
I’m not worried at all. I’m just an ac-
counting major who can’t write, right?
Classic case of sucks-bro.

Without further crappy “journal-
ism,” here’s a short list of six, dank-ass
jerseys, two each from the major three
sports. Enjoy:

Wade Boggs, New York
Yankees #12:

I’ve been a Yankees fan my entire
life and I know this may seem like a bi-
zarre choice for my favorite team. First
of all, Wade Boggs got most ofhis 3,010
hits with the Red Sox, (ew) but he did
play ﬁve seasons with the Bronx Bomb-
ers and win a championship in ’96 with
them. I

The reason I love the Hall-of-Famer
Wade Boggs so much is because of one
story I read about him.

Back in the day, the Yankees played
a game in LA, (which they won) and
Wade Boggs decided to get a little ag-
gressive. He had a 6-pack of Budwieser
chillin’ in his locker, waiting for him at
the end of the game.

Another teammate saw Wade Boggs
pound all six of those brews before
leaving the locker room and proceed to
pick up a case of beer before the cross-
country ﬂight back to New York. In the
seven hours of downtime between the
end of the game, and Boggs returning
home, he drank 50 beers. -

What Wade did that day was a com-
mendable feat, and proper reason for
him making my list of dank-ass jerseys.

John Rocker, Atlanta Braves
#49

I remember watching John Rocker
close out games back in the day when the
Yankees always used play the Braves in
the World Series (and lose). He would
literally sprint from center ﬁeld to the
pitcher’s mound before he went into
the game. I always used to wish that he
would slide into the mound when he got
there, but he never did.

John Rocker was a player highly
linked to steroid use, which may explain
his visible insanity on the diamond. Not
only was he a lefty, but he did some le-
git things in the major leagues before
his testicles shrank too much due to the
unicorn blood he used to enhance his
performance.

His antics were unparalleled and he
meant a lot to the best game on earth,
therefore, I have no shame in putting
him on my list.

Larry Bird, Indiana State #33
Larry Bird had one of the sweetest
jump shots in all of basketball. I’m not,
and will never, claim to be, a huge bas-
ketball aﬁcionado, but it would take an
idiot to say Larry Bird wasn’t a special
player. He knew how to win ball games.
The reason I use Indiana State in-

ColumnistAli Greenberg explores the history that makes our campus unique

By All Greenberg
COLU M N I ST

During my week at home over Spring
Break, I had very few obligations or re-
sponsibilities. My days tended to follow
the schedule of wake up eventually, get
up eventually, ﬁnd food somewhere,
walk the dog, lie back down, ﬁnd more
food, watch TV, sleep.

So besides catching up on “3O Rock”
and “Family Guy” and potentially ﬁnd-

knowledge, and then I read about an
alum that was an absolute gem.

George William Crump, class of
1804, was the United States’ ﬁrst re-
corded streaker. Yes, streaker. He was
caught one night his senior year by Ye
Olde Lex Po running naked through the
streets of Lexington.

And while he was suspended for a

While I never got the opportunity
to experience the 6-week, two-course
term, I do know that the 4-week Spring
Term of today is where it’s at.

Yet, is four weeks really enough? By
the time we actually gq adjusted to the
course content and the professors’ ex-
pectations and grading, we are already
halfway through the course. Sometimes
it seems as pointless as

to root for in the
NBA, I really only
had time in my
busy schedule for
one thing: spend-
ing hours upon
hours on my com-
puter. I actually
had to recharge my
laptop three times
in one day. That’s
obscene.

I read blogs, watched Netflix and
generally wasted a lot of time. During
a moment of intellectual intrigue, I even
looked up our ﬁne institution on Wiki-
pedia. _

While scrolling through the article, I
learned a lot about our school. For in-
stance, did you know that Meriwether
Lewis, as in the Lewis in Lewis & Clark,
was class of 1793?

Or that our ﬁght song, “The Wash-
ington and Lee Swing,” was actually an
incredibly popular tune and has been ad-
opted by dozens of schools as well as re-
corded by just about every famous jazz
musician at the time, including Louis
Armstrong.

And in the spirit of Mock Conven-
tion, another alum, Mr. John W. Davis
(1892, l895L) was the 1924 Candidate

for the Presidency (we predicted cor-V

rectly that yearl). While he inevitably
lost to the incumbent, Coolidge, he still
went on to become a'very successful
lawyer, up until he picked the wrong
side on the whole Brown v. Board de-
bate. Awkward.

Up ‘till this point I was pleasantly
surprised and enlightened by my new

semester, he went on to graduate from
Princeton, UPenn Medical School, be-
come a U.S. Representative, and land
an ambassadorship in Chile. Essentially
making him the entire student body’s
new hero.

The fact that Washington & Lee pro-
duced the New World’s ﬁrst recorded
streaker is just an incredible testament
to the social structures and attitudes of
our illustrious university.

And now that Spring Term is ﬁnally
here, we shouldn’t expect any short-
age of undergrads streaking the Colon-
nade and then hoping to get hooked up
with a sweet job after graduation. Over
two hundred years later, so little has
changed.

We have many traditions at our
school, with one of the greatest being
the Spring Term. Started in 1970 and
born from the hippie and alternative ed-
ucational movements of the generation,
Spring Term was created in order to pro-
vide a unique and enriching academic
environment that gave students the op-
portunity to truly engage themselves in a
speciﬁc course and form better relation-
ships with their professors.

the Pacquiao/Mosley
ﬁght.

But it’s in the social
sense where the time
limit is both a gift and
a curse. We come back
from Spring Break re-
freshed and, well, ready
to party. And yet we are
greeted with only three
weekends. Three!

And two of them are
already gone, slipped away already from
right under us.

However, just as distance makes the
heart grow fonder, our limited time pro-
vides an extremely dense concentration
of events over the shortened term. So
while there are only four weeks, there is
so much room for activities!

I am not calling for a return to the
six-week term. I like things how they
are now and the administration has been
very clear that the switch back would
simply be infeasible.

I am really just writing this as a re-
minder that we are halfway through if
this paper actually comes out on Mon-
day like it is supposed to. So stop wast-
ing time reading the Ring-tum Phi, get
out your lax penny and go enjoy Spring

than day drinking and band parties, and
we are nothing without our traditions.

Reebok “Shaqnosis” shoes (Google that

be good at basketball. Besides his im-
pressive career statistics, he’s the man
and deserves to be on this list without
question.

Deion Sanders, Florida State

#2

”If you look good, you play good, if
you play good, they pay you good!” Too
bad I play Division 3 baseball...

Deion was not only an amazing
football player, but he was also a spec-
tacularly average baseball player. He
was an eccentric personality known as

“prime-time,” and if asked to rank the
ﬁve best comerbacks of all time, he
would respond with l. Deion 2. Deion
3. Deion 4. Deion 5. Deion.

Get his college jersey from Florida
State. The only thing that could make
this jersey cooler is if he went to the U
instead.

‘Nuff said.

Joe Namath, New York Jets
#] 2

I’m not sure what’s cooler, the super ~

bowl ring Namath guaranteed, or the
fur coats he used to wear: deﬁnitely the
ring.

Namath played nine strong seasons
in the NFL and has one notable ring to
show for it. He was a loud mouth and
Brut man; both very cool things. Joe
was a notorious New York party animal
and has one huge superbowl victory to
show for a remarkably sub-par career.

Whatever, this is a sweet jersey and
he was a major bad-ass. Well worth the
purchase.

This is the end of my list, and the end
of my story. Peace.

Capitol Steps kicks off Mock Con right

The Hill-based comedy troupe entertains students, faculty, community and provides satirical outlook on politics

By Sage Um
5 TA F F w R l T E R

Last Wednesday night, the satiri-
cal political comedy group The Capitol
Steps performed at Keller Theater as
part of Mock Conventi0n’s Spring Kick-
off.

The Steps did various skits about
Sarah Palin, the events in Egypt,
Obama’s health care efforts, and former
Presidents Bush and Clinton. One mem-

orable speech was at the very end of the
performances where the performer flip-
ﬁopped the ﬁrst and last syllables of all
his words.

Many students, faculty, and commu-
nity members showed up to the perfor-
mance and enjoyed their savvy parodies.

The Steps ﬁrst started as a group of
Senate staffers mocking their employ-

ers at a Christmas patty in 1981. Their
ﬁrst intentions were to stage a Con-
gressional nativity play, but when they
failed to ﬁnd three wise men or a virgin
in Congress, they chose headlines of the
day to parody and make songs for a new
type of satirical humor. And since then,
they have been famous for their unique
political comedy. Most ofthe cast mem-

bers have worked in Congress, for both
Democrats and Republicans.

The Capitol Steps have recorded
dozens of albums and appeared on
various TV shows like “Good Morning
America”. They have also done specials
for public radio (“Politics Takes a Holi-
day") and even performed for ﬁve US
Presidents.

Larry King said, “They’re the best.
There’s no one like them, no one in their
league.”

Thecurrent parody/ song on The Cap-
itol Steps website addresses Osama Bin
Laden’s death and President Obama’s
birth certiﬁcate, comparing the two.

The Capitol Steps was deﬁnitely a
great way to start Mock Convention’s

W&L ’s Outing Club journeyed to the Piney River for aﬂy-ﬁshing expedition

ByDane Davis
STAFF WRITER

Members of the Outing Club have been
busy rafting, hiking, and most recently, ﬂy
ﬁshing, as they take advantage of the warm
spring weather. Early last week, James
Dick, Outing Club director, and four Wash-
ington and" Lee students trekked out to the
Piney River to fly ﬁsh on the stocked pond
and two miles of creek that runs through a
100-acre property.

“It was a lot of fun,” said Steele Burrow.
This was his ﬁrst time ﬂy-ﬁshing in the East

out ofthe countryside.” '

’ According to the guys on the trip, the
biggest ﬁsh caught was about l2 inches, and
everyone hooked at least two ﬁsh. Dick,
however, managed to angle nine ﬁsh, tri-
pling everyone else’s catch. All of the fish
caught during the three-hour excursion were
Brook Trout, and all ﬁsh were released.

The Washington and Lee women’s lacrosse
team completed yet another successful week
by adding to its already impressive win streak
and clinching its l2th conference champion-
ship.

On Wednesday, the top-seeded Gener-
als defeated fourth-seeded Virginia Wesley-
an College 9-6 in the semifinal round of the
ODAC tournament, played in Lexington.

W&L started the game hot, attempting nine
shots in the first 10 minutes while the Marlins.
only managed one. Despite the bombardment
of W&L shots, Virginia Wesleyan found the
net first, taking a 2-0 advantage with just un-
dcr l7 minutes left in the ﬁrst half.

The Generals responded by putting in
three consecutive shots in the next three min-
Lites, taking a 3-2 lead. Senior attacker Wilton
Mcgargel made in the ﬁrst goal, andjunior at-
tacker‘ Alli Shearin followed 30 seconds later
with a goal of her own. Senior attacker Kate
Spearc kept up the pressure by scoring less
than two minutes later.

Unlike most of W&L’s previous confer-
ence opponents, VWC kept the match close,
answering with another goal to tie the game
with just over i I minutes left in the half.

Senior midfielders Kate Donnelly and
Emmy Mathews were able to each put in an-
other goal before the end of the half, allowing
W&L to go into the break with a 5-3 lead.

The Generals opened the second half in a
similar fashion to how they opened the game,
except this time the shots went in. The team
scored four unanswered goals to take a 9-3
lead, its largest ofthe game, with 12 and a half
minutes left in the game.

Mathews accounted for two of the addi-
tional goals. and Speare and Megargel each
also added another goal. Mathews scored
first, putting in an assist from Spcare, and then
Speare made in her goal. Mathews followed
and Megargel ﬁnished the run with her goal.
The last three goals came in a span ofjust over
two minutes.

The team managed to hold offa late surge
by the Marlins, who put in three goals in the
final l0 minutes, and were able to secure the
victory and move on to the tournament ﬁnals.

Mathews led the team with three goals
while Spearc was right behind with two goals
and an assist. Megargel also added two goals.
Senior Katharine Farrar spent the entire game
in the net and recorded l0 saves for the day.

The Gener-
als responded ‘~ .
with vigor, putting in ﬁve straight goals in
only four and a half minutes and taking a 5-2
lead with just under 18 minutes remaining in
the ﬁrst half. Shearin started the scoring run
after forcing a turnover and taking the ball di-
rectly to the net. Donnelly put one in less than
two minutes later, and Shearin added another
57 seconds after Donnelly. This gave the team
its first lead of the contest with just over 19
minutes left in the half, a lead that it would not
give up for the rest of the game.

Mathews and junior attacker Maddie McK-
aig ﬁnished the run by each scoring free posi-
tion goals.

The teams ﬁnished out the first half alter-
nating goals. Roanoke put in five goals before
the break, and the Generals put in six to go into
the halfwith an ll-7 lead. Three ofthose goals
came from Mathews, while Shearin put in two
and Donnelly added one.

Just a minute and a half into the second pe-
riod, Mathews put in her ﬁfth goal ofthe day
to give W&L a.live-score lead. The Maroons
stayed in the game, putting in two shots'back-
to-back and bringing the score to within three
with 27 minutes left in the game.

The Generals responded with two goals of

their own, one each by Mathews and McKaig.
Roanoke snuck in one, but W&L then took
off on a six-goal streak, taking a 20-10 lead
with just under eight minutes remaining in the
contest. First-year midﬁelder Meade Brews-

victory. Mathews accounted for the ﬁnal W&L
goal.

Mathews bested her previous career record
of six scores, which she set the week before
against Randolph-Macon, by putting in eight
goals. Shearin tied her career-high of ﬁve
goals and Megargel ﬁnished the day with four
scores. Farrar again spent the entire game in
the net and recorded ﬁve saves.

Senior Kathy Brown, Mathews, Shearin
and ﬁrst-year Alex Van Horn were all named
to the All-Tournament team for their perfor-
mances throughout the ODAC tournament.

Winning the ODAC title gave W&L an au-
tomatic bid to the NCAA Division III Wom-
en’s Lacrosse Tournament. The women will
play Christopher Newport in Lexington on
Wednesday for the ﬁrst round of the national
tournament. The time is yet to be determined.

The team played Christopher Newport last
year as part of its regular season, winning the
contest 16-7, but lost in the ﬁrst round of the
NCAA tournament 13-12 to Elizabethtown.

The Generals will go into the tournament
with a 14-4 overall record, including an unde-
feated conference record.

The Washington and Lee men’s and wom-
en’s track & ﬁeld teams competed last Thurs-
day afternoon in the Liberty Twilight Meet,
both trying to earn bids to the NCAA Divi-
sion Ill Championships. Those who competed
faced teams from across the South in the event,
including several NCAA Division I members.

For the men, sophomore Dylan Mills ﬁn-
ished third overall in thejavelin throw but was
ﬁrst among competing Division ill athletes
with a toss of 58.60 meters. His toss before
this meet was 60.99 meters.

First-year Kevin Sullivan also competed in
thejavelin throw, coming in right behind Mills
at ﬁfth overall and second among Division III
throwers with a 53.20 meter toss.

The women also had two strong perfor-
mances in the meet. Sophomore Lauren Schul-
tz ran in the steeplechase, recording a person-
al-best time of 1 1:32.08. Her time placed her
third overall and ﬁrst in Division Ill runners.

First-year runner Annelise Madison ran in
the 1500 meter race, finishing fourth overall
and ﬁrst among Division III competitors after

W&L students speciﬁcally asked to attend by the organization

By Steele Burrow
STA F F WRITE R

This past Thursday, a group of Wash-
ington and Lee students attended a lun-
cheon and speech by Anders Fogh Ras-
mussen, the Secretary General of NATO,
at Johns Hopkins’ School of Advanced
International Studies in Washington,
D.C. Rasmussen previously served as
the Prime Minister of Denmark and as
the leader of Venstre, Denmark’s largest
political party. The talk at S.A.l.S. was
the last stop in NATO’s recent “Allies in
America” tour that also included stops in
Atlanta, Austin, and Chicago.

Washington and Lee received a
special invitation to the talk as a result of
German Professor Dan Kramer’s Spring
Term 2010 class in Germany. Kramer’s
class spent a weekend in Brussels, where
they visited the European Commission
and NATO. The class made a power-
ful enough impression that N.A.T.O.’s
Oﬁice of Public Diplomacy requested
W&L’s attendance at the S.A.I.S. event.
While other schools attended, Washing-
ton and Lee was the only school to be
invited speciﬁcally at NATO’s request.

Several students from Profes-
sor Kramer’s class — Greg Franke ‘l 1,
Clark Caitlin Edgar ’12, and Clark Hil-
debrand ’ 13 — attended the talk in D.C.
“I found the Secretary General’s speech
to be very‘ interesting and informative,”

Franke said, “especially given NATO’s
public role in Libya and the death of
Osama bin Laden.”

The German department also
extended the invitation to other mem-
bers of the W&L community via Ger-
man students, as well as students already
in D.C. for Washington Term. Following
the talk, the W&L group had the oppor-
tunity to have a group photo with the
Secretary General.

A primary purpose of the U.S.
tour was for the Secretary General to
communicate with American students.
NATO’s 2012 summit will be held in the
U.S., so the tour helped to lay ground-
work for possible topics and issues that
will arise at that meeting.

At his D.C. event; Secretary
General Rasmussen began with an over-
view of NATO’s fundamental purpose
and outlined organizational goals for the
future prosperity of its member states.
NATO may have begun as a Cold War-
era institution, but the Secretary General
emphasized the expansion of its man-
date to a post-Cold War purpose. “As
the world changes,” Rasmussen said in
his rich Danish accent, “NATO needs to
change too.”

Rasmussen laid a three-point
framework for NATO’s future that con-

Retiring Provost June Aprille delivered
the keynote address.

The rest of the weekend was ﬁlled
with various receptions, panel discus-
sions, open houses and parties

Returning alums elected new mem-
bers of the Alumni Board and gave the

sisted of commitment,
capabilities, and con-
nectivity. This para-
digm will demand that
the allies ﬁnd what he
described as “new coin-
mon answers to new
common challenges.”
Fiscal responsibility
plays no small part in
this objective. For a
more uniﬁed and effi-
cient “smart defense,” n»
he emphasized, the or-
ganization must stress
cohesion and coopera-
tion that capitalizes on
joint investments for increased savings.
Rasmussen commented briefly
on the recent killing of Osama bin Lad-
en. He congratulated the US. on the suc-
cessful operation and noted the strategic
signiﬁcance of killing al-Qaeda’s long-
timeleader. “Bin Laden stood against all
those values that NATO has defended
for over six decades: freedom, democ-
racy, and humanity,” he said.
“It is now obvious that his evil
ideology is bankrupt."
During the question and an-
swer session following his speech, the
Secretary General delved into signiﬁ-

cant detail on current NATO operations
that can be more controversial. NATO
is currently involved in multiple armed
conﬁicts abroad, notably Afghanistan,
Iraq, and Libya, in addition to anti-pira-
cy efforts off the coast of Somalia and
peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo. By the
Secretary General’s count, 350,000 sol-
diers are currently committed to NATO
operations around the world.
Rasmussen also said that
NATO would continue to play a role
in supporting Afghanistan and assisting
Libya with a transition to democracy.
Afghanistan, he said, will “be able to
stand on its own feet, but will not stand

well. The classes of 1961 and 1986 con-
tributed $3.5 million.

This weekend also gave a chance for
current students to reunite with recent
graduates at a band party in Red Square

alone.” This statement was particularly
signiﬁcant, as NATO has a 2014 dead-
line for ending most control of combat
operations in Afghanistan.

Greg Franke, the senior and
veteran of Professor Kramer"s Spring
Term class, found the speech to be a
welcome opportunity before an upcom-
ing deadline of his own. “Attending the

Secretary General’s speech almost ex- ,

actly one year after our visit in Brussels
was a very appropriate way to end my
college career.”

W&L ’s three Fulbright recepients leave Lexington to teach and research in Europe and Caribbean

By Leigh Dannhauser
STAF F WRITE R

Three Washington and Lee University students
are recipients of the Fulbright Scholarship, a schol-
arship awarded through the Institute of Intemation-
al Education to 1,500 undergraduate and graduate
students throughout the nation.

The application process takes roughly seven
months to complete, from April to October. Each
year between thirteen to nineteen Washington and
Lee students apply, according to Washington and
Lee Professor George Bent..

This year seniors Hannah Muther, Yasmine Es-
pert and Christian Roden received the scholarship.

Bent, the adviser of the Fulbright Program at
W&L, said that it is “quite an honor to be a recipi-
ent” of the grant. -

   

“Odds for them to get the awards were extreme-
ly long” Bent said.

The Fulbright Scholarship includes two types
of grants. One is the English teaching assistantship
grant. This grant allows the winner to go to a for-
eign country and teach English to its natives.

Muther received an English teaching assistant-
ship grant. She will be heading to Saxony, a state in
Germany, to teach English to middle school or high
school students. _

“[Hannah will] be a terriﬁc teacher, students will
love her” Bent said in a telephone interview.

Applicants may also received a research grant.
The research grant sends students to engage in in-
dependent research in a foreign country.

Both Espert and Roden are recipients of the re-
search grant. Espert is researching and curating an
exhibit with the Barbados Art Council. While there,
she will be taking master’s level courses in the cul-
tural studies program at the University of the West
Indies.

Roden, who could not be reached, is researching
in France.

Applicants for both grants" apply to a speciﬁc
country. The competitiveness of the application
process depends on the country.

Bent said that the fact that these students got
their grants speaks to the quality of their work. He
said Roden’s success is particularly notable as it is
extremely difﬁcult for an undergraduate student to

receive the scholarship to France.

“Undergraduates don’t just get grants to
France” Bent explained. “It speaks to the quality of
[Roden’s] project.”

All three recipients are excited to receive the
grants and puruse their projects and studies.

“I was very excited, to say the least” Muther
said. “I have wanted to apply for Fulbright for a
long time, and I spent a long time waiting to hear
back, and it was a relief to ﬁnally hear the good
news.” V

Espert also felt relieved when she found out
she’d received the grant.

“I felt at peace when I got the letter in the mail"
Espert explained. “ltjust felt right.”

Frat’s food revolution

Fraternity cooking is changing for the better and helping members reﬁne their palates

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

In a school so deeply embedded in
tradition, ongoing revolutions are usu-
ally rare and not terribly emphasized.
Furthermore, we don’t tend to pay atten-
tion to things that aren’t that sexy.

If there is an ongoing revolution in
the registrar, say a controversial new
registration process, or a new revolution
in the way parties are conducted, say an
earlier shut down time due to a neighbor-
hood of families wanting to sleep, they
are covered ad nauseam. However, when
there is an actual revolution currently
happening in an area that the campus
usually takes for granted like food ser-
vice, we turn a blind eye.

Back in the day, food in fraternities
was considered to be the lowest of the
low. Achieving heights barely above the
cuisine served in Oliver’s Orphanage, the
food was supposed to provide some kind
of sustenance in between keg stands.

Nowadays, fraternities are in the pro-
cess of progressively switching to a new
kind of eating. By hiring new chefs with
a passion for their profession, food is not
only getting better but it is promoting a
more reﬁned overall lifestyle.

This new style of cooking fraternity
food has two new mantras driving the
process: food is fun and food is educa-
tional. Now, on the surface this sounds
pretty stupid. I could promote toilet pa-
per as being both potentially fun and
educational, and that doesn’t mean that

you will start looking at toilet paper in

a new way. However, these new frater-
nity chefs have the passion and ingenuity
to make fraternity cuisine both fun and
educational. They are driven by compli-
ments, not paychecks.

You will not see this revolution go-
ing on during the day. Let’s face it, when
guys eat lunch, they don’t want ingenu-
ity or originality; they want something
fried and something quick to eat on the

way to class. So don’t expect to see any-
thing change in fraternity dining while
the sun is up.

But when the sun goes down, you will
start seeing a change. Dinners at frater-
nity houses are no longer being dictated
by Pasta Wednesdays or Leftover Thurs-
days, but rather, this new breed of chef
treats dinner much more seriously.

Dinner is now suddenly turning into
French class. “Reheated frozen ﬁsh
with some orange stuff thrown on top”
is now turning into “Swordﬁsh Conﬁt
D’Oignon.” Cultures are moving from
the classroom to the stomach as Poly-
nesian ribs and Irish cabbages are in-
troduced into the equation. Suddenly,
eating dinner is becoming a class in and
of itself. These frat dinners are becom-
ing training grounds for succeeding in
the many foreign places where the frat
members will eventually end up.

Just because food is becoming more
educational doesn’t mean that it can’t be
fun. Without security having to worry,
handles of alcohol are making their way

into the kitchen, where they are now be-

ing used to cook the food.

The ingenuity of these new chefs is
being fully utilized in the form of theme
dinners that vary from Medieval Night,
where foot long carrots and turkey legs
are served without plates, to Titanic’s
Last Meal, where the last meal served on

the ﬁrst deck on the Titanic is replicated

for students.

By keeping dinner interesting and
fun, these chefs are breeding a sense
of camaraderie among the fraternities.
Rarely is the whole fraternity ever in the
same place, except for dinner, and din-
ner is one of the few times that you ac-
tually spend time with people other than
your inner circle of friends. By creating
a fun and exciting atmosphere around
dinner, these chefs are giving these rela-

tive strangers a shared experience to talk
about. I know this seems like it’s going a
little too far, but believe me, theme din-
ners can dissipate even the most conten-
tious of intra-fratemity rivalries.

There is still a leaming curve for
these new chefs. Coming from restau-
rants instead Of other fraternities, these
chefs are not akin to serving a large
quantity of food to be eaten buffet style.
This causes a change in the process, and
creates some bumps along the way, espe-
cially when serving gnocchi swordﬁsh...
not that I’m complaining.

Still, there is an essential element to
this revolution that is vital in saving the
fraternity process. It’s no secret that the
fraternity system is slowly dying here at
Washington and Lee. Whether we talk
about years or decades, the fraternity
system will be eventually phased out of
the W&L culture. ,

To stop this trend, there either needs
to be a huge event preventing fraternities
from ever leaving,‘ or a series of small
events that will prolong fraternity extinc-
tion or keep it living for a long period of
time. I don’t really ‘see how one big event
can permanently save fraternities, espe-
cially with such a big faction of Lexing-
ton vehemently opposing the tradition.

Although this little revolution won’t
save fraternities by itself, the emergence
of passionate fraternity chefs is absolute-
ly vital to saving the fraternity system
because their actions bring out the best
that fraternities have to offer. See, frater-
nities are all about cultivation. The idea
behind them is that these institutions
cultivate old boys into young men. Their
advertised product is a civilized, mature
young man who is both knowledgeable
of the world around him and the people
he interacts with.

By introducing them to proper cuisine
and proper dining habits, these chefs are

cultivating the old boy into
an erudite food consumer.
Business is not just done
in ofﬁces but on play-
ing ﬁelds and restaurants.
Parents hire golf, tennis
and squash coaches for
speciﬁc reasons; shOuldn’t
they also entrust their chil-
dren to a kind of teaching
that will let their kids learn
about what it means to or-
der the right food?

Furthermore, unlike the
vast educational institu-
tions which also advertise
cultivation of the demean-
or as much as cultivation
of the intellect (the Honor
Code’s roll in W&L re-
cruitment is a good ex-
ample), fraternities claim
to cultivate the man through close, per-
sonal interactions that the educational
institutions cannot provide. Fraternities
are supposed to aid you in becoming the
man you want to be. So if you are inter-
ested in the culinary arts as a fad, hobby,
or even a profession, how is micro-
waved General Tso’s Chicken enticing
you in any way to develop that interest?

By throwing themselves passionately
into their profession, these new chefs
are enticing their fraternity members to
unearth a hidden interest in the culinary
arts.

Finally, these chefs are creating the
cultivated man by serving as teachers.
When I came to college, my parents ad-
vised me to take at least one economics
and accounting class, not because they
wanted me to sell my soul and become
an accountant, but because they thought
it was important that I know how to
manage my money. Well, these fraternity
chefs are now teaching their profession

ing the frat food revolution.

to their students, the fraternity members,
not because there are aspiring cooks in
the audience but because every culti-
vated man needs to know how to cook
at least something for himself in order to
survive. ,

These three factors the new chefs
are bringing to the table are exclusive to
the Greek system. D-Hall has too many
students to feed to experiment and work
with students, and the Co-Op and Hillel
House grills don’t serve dinners the same
way.

The chefs are bringing with them a
new fraternity culture of camaraderie
and culinary appreciation. Maybe this
won’t block the sea of anti-fraternity
sentiment, but- it has helped slow the tide
and made fraternity life a much more
positive experience.

And even though we are not at the
promised land of fraternity cooking yet,
the future is smelling mighty delicious.

And while I may joke about the differ-

differences are very real. Similar divides
are persistent between those who come
from private or public schools, white and

These divides are generally unspo-

formal segregation, yet the social atti-

And one of the largest divides I ﬁnd

Freshmen, we’re almost done with the
ﬁrst year! Only one more week left of....D-
Hall and then on to frat, srat, etc. ‘food.

I know it’s the thing to hate on D-Hall try-
ing to be cool by saying, “Oh, I barely eat
there anymore.” I have to admit there are
those meals that make you think, “They to-
tally D-Halled this pizza.” But seriously, D-
Hall isn’t that bad. I mean, it’s certainly part
of the freshman experience. Plus, some of the
people who work there are easily the nicest
people in the world. So I just wanted to list
a few reasons why I think it’s pretty cool be-
fore we all leave for the summer and come
back as oh-so-cool-sophomores.

Sweet D-Hall facts:

1. We have practically unlimited swipes.
Seriously, if you wanted tolget obese this
would be the place to go.

2. The really weird pizzas that have been
around lately. PB&J and banana? Bacon and
peanut butter? Smores? I mean, it keeps life
interesting.

3. Ketchup! I love ketchup on literally
everything and there is just so much of it.
Makes. ‘Me. Happy.

4. Omelettes on Sunday! Is there a bet-
ter way to recuperate from the night before?
Plus, the thirty minute wait just makes you
enjoy them all the more. (And let’s be hon-
est, this is probably the only time all week
that you make it for breakfast food. I know
getting up early in the morning can be quite
a challenge.)

5. Whipped cream! There is this huge
glass bowl of it put out every brunch. My fa-
vorite thing to do isjust eat a whole plate full.
It’s the little things in life.

6. Seeing everyone you know all the time.
Or... ’

7. Not being able to avoid anyone, ever.
That guy you DFM’d with last night? Yeah,
he’ll be there.

8. Getting locked in by the grate during
O-week and making the interesting walk
through the kitchen. (This didn’t happen to
everyone but it was an experience.)

9. Foreign dinners! Yeah for having indi-
an, hawaiian and african food, then talking to
people from those countries. They might not
think so, but it tasted good to me.

10. Fro-yo machine! I mean, it’s frozen

yogurt, right? It has to be healthy. Yay for
guilt-free ice cream. (I won’t even say any-
thing about the Green Tea stuff.)

11. Unlimited Diet Coke: the perfect caf-
feine boost to get you through that ten page
paper you forgot to write until a few hours
before it was due.

12. Personal pasta! The equivalent of O1-
ive Garden in a basement. -

13. Finally, people watching. We know
we do it. Who is sitting with whom, watch-
ing frats and srats slowly congregate as the
year goes by, what everyone is wearing. Not
to sound like a stalker or anything; it’s just
fascinating.

So let’s live up this last week before free-
dom and summer and mom’s cooking! Be-
cause really, nothing can ever beat that. Well,
maybe Sunday Omelettes. But I’m cool,
right? So I’m never in D-Hall for those.

5’- THE RING-TUM PHI-

‘WLUR th

By Paige Gance
ARTS & LIFE EDITOR

WLUR, Washington and Lee’s radio
station, threw its ﬁrst Spring Fling cel-
ebration with performances by a student
group, a local band, and an indie folk
band called The Cotton Jones.

W&L senior Julie Slonecki played
guitar and sang with Scotty Groth on
bass and Scott Harisson on drums, appro-
priately calling themselves Julie and the
Scotts. Julie is no stranger to perform-
ing at W&L, having played on several of
WLUR’s live radio shows. .

After Julie and the Scotts concluded

what Scott Matarese called “the best-

performance I’ve seen from them yet,”
the Cinnamon Band took its place in the
commons. This two-person local band is
based out of Staunton, Va. and special-
izes in southern rock.

To conclude the evening, The Cotton
Jones performed a number of lively songs
to much applause from the crowd gath-

ered in Elrod Commons. Some know the
band by its previous name, Page France.

Planning for the event started shortly
after February Break, according to Mata-
rese, and WLUR station director Jeremy
Franklin and director of Elrod Com-
mons Kelsey Goodwin collaborated on
what acts to bring to campus and other
logistics. Originally, the concert was to
be held outside, but inclement weather
forced the location change.

Matarese said that WLUR hopes to
make Spring Fling an annual occurrence
and attract an even larger audience.

W&L’s own Julie and the Scotts performed alongside Staunton—based Cinnamon
Band at WLUR’s Spring Fling.

Play celebrates Lexington history

Theater and Journalism Professors collaborate on “Letters to the Editor ” theater production

By Michael Freeman
STA F F w RITE R

Washington and Lee will feature a
new theater production titled “Letters
to the Editor” that incorporates a com-
pilation of letters written to Lexington’s

News-Gazette over the course of nearly

200 years. The performances will take
place May 19th, 20th, and 21st, at 7:30
p.m. at Theater at Lime Kiln.‘

The idea was the brainchild of Gerald
Stropnicky a member of a Bloomsburg,
Pa. theater ensemble. W&L journalism
professor Pam Luecke suggested the
idea to theater professor Kimberly Jew

who immediately saw potential in the
project.

“It stayed in my mind for about a year
and a half or so,” says Jew. “When I had
sabbatical I wasn’t directing or doing
anything creative, and I was thinking, ‘I
want to do something, youpknow, really
do something.’ I miss it. So I contacted
her [Pam Luecke] and she was still in-
terested in trying to put the pieces to-
gether.”

Jew then contacted journalism pro-
fessor Doug Cumming, who was inter-

ested in collaborating on the project.

“What it came down to is, I had a
summer free; Kimberly Jew had a sum-
mer free,” says Cumming.” “My inter-
est, my academic scholarly specialty is
media history, so it was perfect. We both
applied for Lenfest grants and RE. Lee
Summer Scholar grants.”

The grants afforded Cumming with
numerous hands to sift through over
8,000 letters. Eventually 120 were se-
lected to be used in the performance.
Jew’s fall term theater class was then

responsible for transforming these let-
ters into a concrete, dramatic piece. The
selected letters seek to convey certain
universal themes.

“There are certainly themes of poli-
tics, self-governance, and themes of
daily life,” says Jew. “How do we all
live together in a rural, town-gown com-
munity? There is a lot of diversity here.
lt may not be ethically, but there are a
lot of people from difference parts ofthe
country, different social and economic
class, religious beliefs, and ages.”

Jew wants this play to acquaint stu-
dents with local issues and enhance their
knowledge of Lexington’s history. She
also hopes students develop a deeper re-
spect for humanity in general from this
performance.

“I hope they leave with a sense that
people are people. I think that’s one of
the funniest things. You can read from
people from the nineteenth century and
the language and the prose is different,
but the thought is the same.”

Track tries for national meet  

Three Washington and Lee‘ athletes Competed in track meets last week in effort to qualify for the NCAA tournament

By Angela Williams .
STAF F WRITE R

Despite the end of Washington and
Lee track’s regular season, a few ‘of the
W&L track stars still had one last meet
to compete in.

On Thursday, sophomore Dylan
Mills represented the men’s track team
at the Roanoke/Virginia Tech Last
Chance meet in his attempt to qualify for
the NCAA Division 111 Championship
Meet. Mills’s specialty ofjavelin helped

' him to set a new school record.

N HLer Boogaard’s brain donated fortr

By Dave Campbell
AP spoars WRITER

ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -— Derek
Boogaard’s relatives and fans shed tears
Sunday as they remembered the former
NHL tough guy as a “teddy bear” who
was as generous and kind as he was bur-
ly and tough, a somber end to a week-
end during which his distraught family
agreed to donate his brain to medical
researchers. 1

The 28-year-old Boogaard was found
dead in his Minneapolis apartment Fri-
day, ﬁve months after he sustained a
season-ending concussion with the New
York Rangers.

Boogaard’s agent and a spokeswom-

an for the Boston University School of
Medicine conﬁnned Sunday that his
brain will be examined for signs of a
degenerative disease often found in ath-
letes who sustain repeated hits to the
head. .
“lt’s an amazing thing he did and his
family did. Hopefully, that’ll bring some
information,” agent Ron Salcer said._
“We don’t know exactly the impact that
the concussions might have played.”

Salcer spent three days with Boogaard
in Los Angeles earlier in the week. Sal-
cer remarked about his client’s bright-
ened demeanor, after suffering through a
winter of not being able to play or even
be active while his head healed.

“He seemed very good, and that’s
what makes it more painful,” Salcer
said. “He was really starting to feel bet-
ter about everything. He was in great
shape.” J

Minneapolis police said there were
no outward signs of trauma, but results
of an autopsy are expected to take sev-
eral weeks. There is no known con-
cussion connection to his death, but at
Boogaard’s wish his family signed pa-
pers to donate his brain to the BU Center
for the Study ofTraumatic Encephalopa-

as breaking the current school record,
which he already held at 60.99 meters,
with his most recent throw of61.04 me-
ters. Mills is the only General to ever
throw the javelin farther than 60 meters.

Though his throws were long enough

to qualify for the national tournament, he

will not know if he will continue on for
a few more days, as only a select number
of athletes are chosen to compete.
Members of the W&L women’s track
team also had a good showing last week,
as they competed on Wednesday at

thy. The donation was ﬁrst reported by
the Star Tribune of Minneapolis.

Salcer said Boogaard was approached
by researchers after the death of former
NHL enforcer Bob Probert, who died
last year at the age of 45. The BU cen-
ter found evidence in Probert’s brain of
the chronic traumatic encephalopathy,
which is associated with cognitive and
behavioral problems and eventually
causes dementia. '

“He had had a concussion. They
played similar styles,” Salcer said.

The center also found previously that
Reggie Fleming, a 1960s tough guy who
played before helmets became manda-
tory, had CTE, as did Dave Duerson, an
NFL star whose brain was donated after
he committed suicide.

Boogaard’s parents, Len and Joanne,
sister, Kyrsten, and brothers, Aaron,
Ryan and Curtis, all attended the memo-
rial inside Xcel Energy Center, where
the 6-foot-7, 265-pound enforcer be-
came a fan favorite with the Minnesota
Wild for his ﬁghting prowess despite
scoring all of two goals in ﬁve seasons
with the team. They did not address the
cause of Boogaard‘s death or comment
on his decision to donate his brain to sci-
ence.

Ryan politely declined to be inter-
viewed in detail after the event. He said
he was already in town to visit his broth-
er, before they all planned to attend their
sister’s graduation ceremony at Kansas
University next weekend.

With a few hundred fans, many
wearing replicas of Boogaard‘s No. 24
jersey with the Wild, standing in the
arena lobby, general manager Chuck
Fletcher, former teammate Wes Walz
and Boogaard’s sister and brother took
turns telling stories and reading tributes.

The memorial sprouted from a Face-

The Washington and Lee women’s lacrosse
team ﬁnished it’s season last week, bringing in
one win on Wednesday and losing in the sec-
ond round of the NCAA Division 111 Touma-
ment.

The ﬁfteenth-ranked Generals took down
Christopher Newport University, 15-6, in the
ﬁrst round of the tournament in Lexington.

The game marked W&L’s ﬁrst NCAA tour-
nament win since the 2007 season.

The Generals jumped out to an early 3-1
lead; all three goals came from free position
shots. Senior Wilton Megargel put in the ﬁrst
goal a little over eight minutes into the con-
test, but 13-6 CNU answered two minutes
later with an unassisted goal. Junior Maddie
McKaig and senior Emmy Mathews each
made a free position shot in order to give the
team a 3-1 lead with a little under 14 minutes
remaining in the ﬁrst half.

CNU scored their only other goal of the
half to pull the team back to one goal’s separa-
tion, but the Generals ran four straight goals
to take a 7-2 lead at the end of the ﬁrst half.
Three of the Generals’ four goals were scored
by Mathews, andjunior Alli Shearin scored an
unassisted shot.

Just over half way into the second half,
W&L had taken a dominating 13-2 lead af-
ter they continued their ﬁrst half scoring run
by netting six unanswered goals. Shearin,
Mathews and senior Kate Speare opened the
half with hot shooting, instantly scoring three
goals in just over a minute and a half.

.On Friday, the eighth-ranked women trav-

After a slight delay due to lightning, the
Generals cleaned-up the doubles competition,
dropping only seven games in three matches
and bringing the score to 3-0.

The number 1 doubles pair of Lauren Lu-

T kas and Trelsie Sadler teamed up to defeat

als by quickly defeating the Colonels 6-1, 6-1,
and 6-1, 6-3, respectively. Ellen Yeatman and
Lauren Lukas also played, but they did not
need to complete their games as the Generals
had already secured the win by taking the ﬁrst
5 matches.

Saturday, the W&L women continued their
progress by defeating Carnegie Mellon 5-4 in
the toumament’s third round, coming back to
take the victory after being behind 4-2.

The match started rough as the number

Salisbury scored three unanswered goals
