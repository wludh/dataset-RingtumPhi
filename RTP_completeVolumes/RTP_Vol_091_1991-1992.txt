LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

SEPTEMBER 12, 1991

Religion professor Rogers dies of cancer at 61

By Sarah Drain and Courtney Hall
Of The Ring-tum Phi Staff

 

A memorial service for Washington and Lee
professor Minor Rogers will be held Sept. 17 at
noon in Lee Chapel.

Rogers, who taught religion and specialized
in East Asian studies, died August 25 at the
Columbia Medical Center in New York City.

He was 61.

neurologist at Columbia University.

Born in London, Rogers came to Lexington
in 1948 when he entered Virginia Military
Institute. During his Army service in the
Korean War, Rogers first encountered Japanese
culture, a subject which became the focus of
much of his later professional work.

In 1958, Rogers was ordained an Episcopal
priest at the Virginia Theological Seminary. He
served as a missionary in Kyushu, Japan, from
1961 to 1965.

Rogers received his doctorate from Harvard
University’s Center for the Study of World

the Washington and Lee faculty as an assistant
professor. He served as head of the religion
department from 1984 to 1989. :

Rogers helped develop W&L’s East Asian
department, which includes an exchange
program with Rikkyo University in Tokyo and
Kansai University of Foreign Studies in
Hirakata, Japan.

Rogers was the author of many journal
articles and papers on Japanese Buddhism; he
presented several of them at national and
international academic meetings. Fluent in
Japanese, Rogers translated many Japanese

Rogers’ wife, Ann Tutwiler Rogers, is an
instructor in Japanese at W&L.

“Those of us who studied Asian religion
with Professor Rogers were often impressed
with the eccentric reverence he always brought
to the conversations,’’ remernbers Jason
Robertson, a Rogers advisee.

‘*He would often stop thoughtfully when a
student made a_ particularly _ insightful
comment,’’ Robertson continued. ‘‘A smile
would come across his face and the realization
that the Buddha and Wheel of Samsara were
also real and alive in his students.

Rogers suffered complications from
widespread cancer that was diagnosed in early
July, said his son, John D. Rogers, a

Program
cut for
freshmen

By Jennifer Gibson

The class of 1995 ends its Ori-
entation Program Sunday, just one
week after international Asian stu-
dents completed a Preorientation
Program very different than in years
past.

“We didn’t have the program in
a traditional sense,’’ Associate Dean
of students Anece McCloud said.

In Preorientation, a group of
freshmen representing diverse geo-
graphic, ethnic and racial back-
grounds are brought together a week
before Freshman Orientation to help
them become accustomed to W&L
and Lexington, McCloud said.

‘We invited blacks and other
minorities, all international students,
both exchange and four-year, and
whites from areas not well-represen-
ted in the student body,’’ McCloud
said of the program in past years.

Minority Student Association
President Rita Poindexter _ap-
preciated béing included in Preorien-
tation her freshman year.

‘It’s not easy to be a minority
here,’’ Poindexter said. With Preori-
entation, “‘you have someone to
bond with. When the flock comes
in, it’s easier if you have someone
to share your experience.’’

But last year the program grew
to almost 40 freshmen.

“*Preorientation was getting too
big and causing a lack of continuity
in the freshman class,’’ Dean of
Students David Howison said,

With athletes included, ap-
proximately 60 freshmen arrived
early, creating logistical problems
for the university, McCloud said.

Howison proposed to discon-
tinue the program on a trial basis
this year. But Professor Harold Hill
of the East Asian studies department
still saw a need for Preorientation
for international Asian students.

 

“They have a greater language

and cultural problem in adjusting
here, both living in the U.S, and at
a university,’’ Hill said.
International Club President
Hui-chu Mou agreed with Hill on
the issue of Asian students, but has
reservations about the need for
Preorientation for black students,
“T think it’s good for the
Asian students, because they get
more attention,’’ Mou said. ‘‘The

black students, they are American. I
don't think they need any help in
opening bank accounts and getting
P.O. boxes.”’

The Asian students who at-
tended this year’s Preorientation
were glad for their early arrival. But
they said they would have liked
more interaction with American
students.

Diver
dies at
falls

By Jennifer Mayo
Staff Reporter

 

 

One last dive ended in a fatal
accident for a 21-year-old Falls
Church, Virginia woman at Panther
Falls last summer.

James Madison University student
Larkin Smith and her friends were
preparing to leave Panther Falls on
the afternoon of June 5 when Larkin
said she wanted to take one more
dive. Smith plunged into submerged
rock, cutting her head and breaking
her neck on impact. She died four
days later.

Smith and her friends had been
jumping and diving off the rocks all
afternoon, said Katrina Miller, another
JMU student and friend of Smith’s.
Bul when she dove from the rock to

ver's dark waters.

Washington and Lee graduate
John McManus, ‘91, and his family
were at the falls when Smith was
injured,

“T saw this one girl doing a lot
of dives," McManus said of Smith
‘*She tried to do a pike, and I guess
she didn’t get out far enough, be
cause she hit a rock and floated to
the top, She was tuming blue, and
we tried to give her CPR, but she
wasn't breathing.’

McManus’ brother Tim pulled

carried her a mile through the woods
and rocky terrain to the parking lot.

“Tim, a guy from JMU, and |
carried her up the trail over rocks
and roots,"’ McManus said. ‘‘It took
us about 10° minutes; we were
running as fast as we could.”’

From the parking lot, John drove
ten winding miles down the mountain
on U.S. Route 60 to Buena Vista,
because none of the JMU students
knew the way to Buena Vista or
Lexington.

“IT was really scared because the
cut on her head was so deep,”
McManus said. ‘‘We could see into
her head, but I concentrated on driv

 

Sigma Chi and Sigma Phi Epsilon
will move to two new fraternity
houses to be built in Davidson Park,
according to new university plans.

‘“We are serving everybody’s best
interests in building the new houses,”’
said Coordinator of Capital Planning
Frank Parsons.

While architects complete their
drawings for these two houses and
the rest of Fraternity Renaissance
Phase III, work on the program’s
Phase II houses is being completed.
Also, some minor work is being done
on the previously-completed Phase I
houses.

Parsons explained even if the
current house Sigma Chi occupies
were renovated, it would still not be
able to have a separate party facility,
meaning the dining room would have
to serve ‘‘double duty.’’

“IT think it’s unfortunate that
we're losing our prime location, but
it is in the best interest of the chap-
ter,’’ Sigma Chi President Charles
Edwards said.

Parsons also said that in the
course of renovating the current
house, the number of members able
to live in Sigma Chi would actually
drop from 15 to 12.

He said the cost of building a
new house in Davidson Park will
probably be equal to or less than the
cost that would have been incurred
attempting to renovate the current
house.

According to Parsons, the current
structure will be renovated and most
likely used by the university’s De-
velopment Office.

SPE will get a new house for a
number of reasons, Parsons said.

First, Parsons said, the estimated
cost of renovating the SPE house is
about one million dollars.

“The cost is far more than we
should spend on renovating one
house,’’ he said.

Another reason, according to
Parsons, is the opposition the univer-
sity would expect to encounter in
obtaining a zoning permit from the
city before any work could be done.

Because SPE is in a residential
area, it is one of the few houses on
campus that would need to obtain a
conditional use permit if it were to
be renovated.

Parsons said that since SPE has
had ‘‘problems with its neighbors on
both sides,’’ enough opposition might
be raised so that the request for a
permit would be denied by the city.

Parsons said the university might
sell the current SPE house or might
renovate it so it can be used as hous-
ing for visiting faculty.

Parsons said the university will
submit the site plan for the two new
Davidson Park houses to the city
planning commission this week. If all
goes well, he said, construction could
begin in January and members could
move into the houses in January
1993,

Meanwhile, work is almost com-
plete on some of the Phase II houses
and planning has begun for Phase III.

Parsons said workers are finishing
up the basement of Lambda Chi
Alpha and that members, who are
already living in the house, will be
able to use the basement in time for
Fraternity Rush.

“The university and the contrac-
tors have been extremely coopera-
tive,’’ Lambda Chi President Shane
Kimzey said. ‘‘They assure us the
basement will be done in time for
Rush, or they will work around our
schedule,”’

The house being renovated for
Kappa Sigma should be completed by
mid-September, Parsons said, and

Where’s the party?

Hollins students vote to curtail traditional fest

 

By Jason Kelley
Editor

 

 

“Last year, you couldn't even walk here,’ the fresh-
man heard the upperclassman say as he pointed to the
street between the second and third rows of apartments.
“This is nothing like it used to be.’’

The upperclassman was right. The traditional day
before-classes-party at the Hollins College Apartments
Tuesday night was nothing like it used to be

‘We used to get about 1500-1600 people at the
party,’’ said Hollins Director of Security Robert O. Wills.
“This year I'd estimate there were only about 400-450

people in the apartments.’

According to Christine Knight, Hollins Coordinator of
Special Events, the school’s student leadership last year
decided they wanted to diminish the size of the apartment
parties because of the risks involved with mass, public

drinking,

“Last spring,’’ Knight said, ‘‘the student leaders
proposed to the student body in a ‘town meeting’ that
they all try to downsize the parties, and the students

voted to approve it.”’

Knight said the possible loss of the school’s liquor
license was also a consideration for the students.

threatened the school with loss of its license. He added,
though, that a new agent had taken charge of the Roa-
noke office since the last apartment parties were held.

Wills said Hollins’ security had to intervene in only

a few incidents during the parties.

is for everyone

The arrival of the class of 1995 might mark the
beginning of a new era of cohesiveness in the Wash-
ington and Lee community. This step forward is
attributable not so much to the Freshman Orientation
Program as to the trial elimination of a program
called Preorientation.

Few people know about Preorientation, though it
has gone on for years. Minority students, including
black and international students, as well as American
students from areas infrequently represented in
W&L’s student body, all arrived in Lexington one
week prior to their freshman classmates. They par-
ticipated in activities like those of regular Orientation,
including icebreakers and academic prep seminars.
The students also received optional guidance in open-
ing bank accounts and getting post office boxes.

The immediate result of the program seemed posi-
tive. The students had fun. They got to know each
other better than they did the sea of freshmen who
arrived on move-in day. Amid the regular Orienta-
tion’s often chaotic constraints, the Preorientation
students were able to turn to each other for support.

But this year the administration cancelled Preorien-
tation, responding to the long-term effects of the
program, which were not as rosy as their short-term
counterparts. The problem was that Preorientation
worked too well.

You will never forget the first people you met at
school. If they are not your closest friends now, they
are at least people to whom you talk in the Co-op,
people with whom you like to keep in touch. So it
was for the Preorientation group; consequently, bar-
riers arose between the Preorientation students and
their freshman classmates at large. The bonding that
resulted when freshmen experienced the regular Or-
ientation Program together too often did not incor-

porate the earlier bonding of the Preorientation group.

Even more alarming is that the people who ex-
perienced that premature bonding were the same
people who needed the most help adjusting to W&L’s
conservative atmosphere. The president of the Minor-
ity Students Association said that being a minority on
this campus is not easy, and she is right. Why com-
plicate matters by isolating minorities from the start?

We applaud Dean Howison for his bold step in ex-
perimenting with a new approach to Preorientation.
Though we do agree that minorities who face the
barrier of language must be brought in early, there is
no need to divide the freshman class any further.
Preorientation, as it was handled before this year,
only contributed to the cultural and racial hurdles that
the W&L community must overcome in order to
carry our fine traditions into the 21st century.

Real diversity

True danger lies in refusing to listen to differing opinions

MY VIEW
By David Bernstein

 

‘Diversity’ is the new catch phrase of the
self-appointed campus race monitors. They demand
‘‘diversity’’ of almost every kind — race, gender,
sexual orientation, even physical ability. What these
folks won’t countenance, however, is diverse
opinions.

As a black college student at the University of
Maryland, I learned this truth the hard way. As a
black conservative, I was ostracized by the very
people who claimed to value difference because I
was, well, different. They didn’t mind that I was
black, of course, but College Park’s politically

tical to the idea of a uni-
versity education.

correct student leadership seemed to prefer ideo-
logical lockstep within their ‘‘diverse’’ student
body.

Fortunately, I was never subjected to the kind
of overt intolerance that many black conservatives
endure, but there was always a palpable disdain for
me and my views among other minority students.
One black sophomore, for example, explained to
me that ‘‘white people are putting those ideas in
your head.’’ Another of my peers wrote in the
student newspaper that black conservatives must be
‘*neutralized’’ (whatever that means). Still another
person once complained, ‘‘you just don’t under-

 

 

Wilson welcomes
students

To the Students of the University:

At the invitation of The Ring-tum Phi, I
happily take this special opportunity to welcome
you to the beginning of another academic year -
- the two hundred and forty-second in the life of
Washington and Lee University. I hope for us all
a successful year as we once again set about the
essential business of the University.

The year before us will unfold quickly and,
implausible though it may seem, will conclude all
too soon. I know you will use this precious time
well and will take up your studies with enthu-
siasm and in the confidence that your energy and
talents are sufficient to ensure the achievement
and satisfaction that surely await you.

In celebrating the beginning of a new year, I
hardly need remark that there is much here in
which to take great pleasure — not only chal-
lenging classes and demanding intellectual tasks,
but the fellowship of old friends and new ac-
quaintances, the camaraderie of a caring com-
munity, the thoughtful counsel and support of
faculty and staff, and ever so much more. Take
time in these early days of the term to appreciate
anew the beauty of this place in which you are
privileged to live and work, and give thought to
the stewardship of those whose benefactions have
made your stay here possible. This University
truly is a blessing, and gratitude forever becomes
us.

It is good to have you here. I wish for each
of you a wonderful and rewarding year.

President of the University

stand.’’ It came as no surprise then, when the
president of Maryland’s Black Student Union
refused to work with me and the other black
College Republican when we wanted to bring
conservative black speakers to campus.

Like many black college students, I found the
student leadership’s attempts to insulate me from
diverse opinions condescending and antithetical to
the idea of a university education. Black collegians
should learn to appreciate the rich heritage of
intellectual debate and dissent that has defined the
black American experience. Men like W.E.B.
DuBois, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Wash-
ington, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, Jr.,
did not share a single set of ideas. Each came to
his own conclusions through study and honest
reflection. If any of us hope to understand the
‘“‘black thing’’ referred to by those popular t-
shirts, we must try a little study and reflection of
our own.

In 1905, W.E.B. DuBois scolded a young black
girl when he explained that, ‘‘there are, in the U.S.
today, tens of thousands of colored girls who
would be happy beyond measure to have the
chance of educating themselves that you are
neglecting.’’ He further warned her that, ‘‘ignor-
ance is a cure for nothing... every time a colored
person neglects an opportunity, it makes it more
difficult for others of the race to get such an
opportunity. Do you want to cut off the chances of
the boys and girls of tomorrow?”’

The campus diversity mongers should ponder
DuBois’ words. Each time we refuse to consider
diverse opinions, we are ‘‘neglecting an oppor-
tunity’’ to leam. Each time a minority student
leader demands ‘‘solidarity’’ from his peers, he
makes it more difficult for others of the race to get
such an opportunity. And ignoring or extinguishing
“‘western culture’’ in the curriculum is truly a cure
for nothing.

versity community about a problem we are
having in the Snack Bar. Over the years, we
have had a policy in the Snack Bar that if any
member of our community ‘‘forgot’’ their money,
we have allowed them to make a purchase, so
long as they returned, no later than the next day,
with payment.

This liberal policy, based on the Honor
System, has gotten out of hand. Every day
members of our staff observe students taking
food — candy, ice cream, and beverages —
and walking away without making any effort to
pay.

In the past, students at least used to inform
the cashier that they had forgotten their money
and asked if they could come back and pay. I
now have the impression that students genuinely
believe they don’t need money when they come
into the Snack Bar. Because of our unique Honor
System, they believe they can come, take what
they want, not tell anyone, and come back to pay
at some time convenient to them. This is not the
policy.

The policy is as follows: any person wishing
to make a purchase at the Snack Bar must do so
with his/her University Card or cash. If a situ-
ation does arise when a member of the Univer-
sity community finds that, upon arriving at the
Snack Bar, they have forgotten their wallet, they
may get in the cashier line, and leave their name
and dollar amount of the purchase with the
cashier. That person should then come back and
pay within 24 hours. | stress that this must be
the exception, not the rule.

the average American did not believe that all

Similarly, I would rather not toss aside many of
the great works of science, philosophy, and lit-

GHQ Tavern.

The Student Activities Board will continue
their ‘‘Wednesdays in the Pit’’ program again
this year. Students are reminded that the GHQ,
unlike the Pavilion, which is not licensed by the
state, does hold an ABC license that allows us to
serve beer and wine in the restaurant. Unlike the
Pavilion, the GHQ stands to lose its license to
serve beer and wine if the laws are violated.

The following rules are in effect for the GHQ
on band nights:

1, Only those 21 years of age or over may
purchase and consume alcohol.

2. Non-W&L students under 18 years of age
will not be admitted.

3. All students will be required to show two
forms of identification; a valid driver’s license
and a college I.D.

4. No pitchers will be sold on band nights,
only glasses.

5. Everyone purchasing beer will be required
to show the bartender their ‘‘legal age’’ hand
stamp.

6. Any student caught giving beer to a minor,
or any minor caught consuming beer will have
his/her W&L I.D. confiscated, be ejected for the
evening, and banned from GHQ band nights for
a month. I.D.s may be picked up the following
morning in my office in Evans Hall. Second
violations will result in banishment from GHQ
band nights for the remainder of the year, in
addition to being reported to the Student Conduct
Committee.

Remember two things: using a false LD. is a
possible honor violation, and, secondly, you do
not want to be the one responsible for causing
the University to lose its privilege of offering the
sale of beer and wine on our restaurant menu.

The message is clear. Come on down, ‘‘get
down"’, have a good time. Enjoy our expanded
alternative beverage menu. If you are 21, you
may continue to purchase your favorite cold
beverage.

Bigger battle looms

VMI has won the opening battle
over single-sex admissions, but the
U.S. Justice Department will carry on
the war.

In June, lawyers for the Virginia
Military Institute won their fight in
U.S. District Court to maintain VMI's
single-sex status. But on August 13,
U.S. Attomey General Richard
Thornburgh announced the Justice
Department will appeal Federal Judge
Jackson L. Kiser’s decision.

Kiser ruled that single-sex edu-
cation benefits men and women.

*“VMI’s single-sex status and its
distinctive educational method rep-
resent legitimate contributions to
diversity in the Virginia higher educa-
tion system, and...excluding women is
substantially related to this mission,”’
Kiser wrote.

In addition to praising VMI’s
policy, Kiser, a graduate of the then
all-male Washington and Lee Law
School, condemned the state of Vir-
ginia for its lack of a state-supported
all female school.

“‘The criticism which might be
directed toward Virginia’s higher
educational policy is not that it main-
tains VMI as an all-male institution,
but rather that it fails to maintain at
least one all-female institution,’’ Kiser
wrote.

VMI lead attorney Robert H.
Patterson Jr. expressed confidence in
the school’s chances before the Rich-
mond appeals court.

“It is regrettable that VMI will
have to spend the time and resources
that an appeal will take,’’ Patterson
told the Lexington News-Gazette in
August. ‘‘But we intend to stay to
the end, and I am optimistic that we
will prevail.”’

VMI has spent more than one
million dollars defending its admis-
sions policy, a VMI spokesman told
The News-Gazette.

ministered CPR.”’

Smith's heart was beating, but she had stopped
breathing. Once in Buena Vista, they were able to flag
down a police officer who called an ambulance. Smith
was taken to Stonewall Jackson Hospital, where the
doctors told Miller that Smith’s neck had been instantly
broken. ’

Smith was transported to Charlottesville where she
remained in a coma for three days and died early Sunday
morning.

Miller said Smith was a good diver and enjoyed
Panther Falls several times before the fatal accident.

‘People have to learn that you cannot dive there, even
if you have done it before,’’ McManus said. ‘‘The water ,
level goes up and down, and you just can’t tell where the
rocks are.’’

Kathy Hall, an information officer from the Pedlar
District Ranger’s Office said that ‘‘NO DIVING”’ signs
have been posted there before, but are often dismantled *
and used for campfires. ‘

“Diving should be prohibited there. It’s so impera-
tive. As much as I love Panther Falls, I’ll never go »
back,’’ McManus said.

A sign at Panther Falls that used to read ‘‘DANGER

Parsons said work on both of those houses has gone

Lambda Chi ‘‘let things slide’ towards the end, hence the
continuing work on the basement.

But many students doubt the Phase II houses will be
ready on time. ‘‘For anyone [involved with Phase I] to
have truly believed they would have been living in their
house by last January would have been silly, and people
who believe they will be in on time for Phase II are
being unrealistic,’’ Phi Kappa Sigma President Marc Short

Knick convicted of murder

 

From The News-Gazette

Former Lexington Police Officer
Jerry Knick was found guilty Aug. 9
of second degree murder in the shoo-
ting death of his wife.

Knick had been charged with
first-degree murder after his wife,
Lisa Vincent Knick, died Sept. 30 of
a single bullet wound to the head.

Commonwealth’s Attorney Eric
Sisler had sought a first-degree mur-
der conviction, but the jury did not
agree that the murder was premedi-
tated.

Knick remains free on bond until
his sentencing hearing Sept. 25. The
sentence for second-degree murder
can range from five to twenty years.
In its verdict, the jury recommended
a prison sentence of 10 years.

During the four-day trial, Sisler
sought to prove that Knick had plot-
ted to kill his wife. He said Knick
was having an affair and wanted Lisa

, Oui of the way.

The defense attorneys, Bernard
Natkin and David Natkin, argued that

the gun had gone off by accident.

David Natkin tried to persuade the
jury in his opening arguments that
Knick was angry at his wife because
fellow Lexington Police Officer Sgt.
A.M. ‘‘Bucky’’ Miller was at their
Battery Lane home the night of the
shooting, Sept. 29.

Miller and Knick testified that
Miller and Lisa were not having an
affair, but Knick questioned Miller’s
intentions.

While on patrol Sept. 29, Knick
arrived at his home to find the door
locked and Miller with Lisa inside.
When Knick returned again about an
hour later, Miller was still there and
left at Knick’s request.

About a minute later, Lisa was
shot; she died the next day in a Roa-
noke hospital.

The defense attorneys tried to
prove that the accident had been
caused by Lisa Knick, who apparently
grabbed the gun before she was shot.

However, prosecuting attorney
Sisler argued that Knick’s jealousy
and rage prompted the shooting.

‘‘This man is no stranger to vio-

lence,’ Sisler said, referring to tes-
timony given by-Knick’s first wife,
Deborah Gibson. Gibson said Knick
had put a gun to her head on two
separate occasions while they were
separated and threatened to kill her
and himself.

Sisler said Knick wanted to kill
Lisa so he could be with his mistress,
Cecilia Grubb. Grubb is a Stonewall
Jackson Hospital employee and was
working the night Lisa Knick was
shot.

Knick testified that he has resu-
med his relationship with Grubb since
his wife’s death.

Experts testified that Knick’s
pistol can only be fired when the
squeeze cock mechanism on the gun
was activated. Lexington Police Sgt.
Torben Pederson said pulling in the
squeeze cock, which takes 25 pounds
of pressure to activate, has to be a
deliberate effort.

Physical evidence indicated that
Lisa Knick had probably grabbed the
gun, but did not prove conclusively
how the gun went off.

Two houses break Rush rules

 

By Maureen Levey
Staff Reporter

Two fraternities received rush
wamings this week for violating
Interfraternity Council contact rules,
bringing to question the meaning of
*‘casual contact.’’

The Judicial Board of the IFC
handled the infraction, which involved
fraternity members giving freshmen
rides, Associate Dean of Students
Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins said. He
did not say which fraternities were

* involved.

‘

¢

‘

‘

Casual contact means that chapter
members may extend greetings to
freshmen, but no conversation about
fraternities or Rush may take place,
Atkins said.

Associate Dean of Students Leroy
‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins reminded fraternity
members to refrain from talking to
the freshmen.

Rules for fraternity Rush are
written in the Student Handbook.
Between now and Saturday, the ca-
sual contact rule is in full force.

One fraternity’s rush chairman,
Frank Martien, said he finds the
casual contact rule difficult to follow
while welcoming freshmen to campus.

“I think it’s extremely awkward
to just say ‘hi’ and not talk about
anything of substance,’’ Martien said.

Beginning Saturday, the casual
contact confusion will end, but frater-
nity Rush will begin with a new set
of rules to follow. More rules often
mean more ‘‘dirty rush.’’

“Dirty rush’’ involves any infr-
ingement by a fraternity to the rules
during Rush, particularly houses talk-
ing about other fraternities.

He said another type of dirty rush
involves parties hosted by women.

A woman may invite anyone to
her residence, but rush rules still
apply if more than five members of
a particular fraternity are present,
Atkins said. Freshmen should un-
derstand that open contact with a
chapter member endangers the rush
privileges of a house, he said.

Fines chapters face are usually
proportional to the severity of the
rush violations, Atkins said. Three
Rush violations result in the loss of
Rush privileges which might per-
manently harm a fraternity’s status on
campus.

Freshmen Carrie Southgate and Rachel Smith are a little too close
for comfort in their room in Davis dormitory.

Freshmen feel
squeeze in dorms

 

By Leigh Allen
Staff Reporter

 

The freshman class is larger this
year and some students are feeling
the pinch.

Dorm rooms that served as singles
last year have been converted to
doubles. Also, some rooms that were
used as lounges have been turned
back into bedrooms.

Assistant Dean of Students for
Freshmen and Residence Life Dennis
G. Manning said that there has not
been an increase in the number of
complaints from freshmen regarding
the living arangements.

“If we put two freshmen in the
most capacious double available, and
two more in a shoe box, we'd get the
same amount of whining,’’ Manning
said.

Manning added _ that the
problem was further complicated by
what he calls the ‘‘inexact science of
admissions.’’

‘*We were told to expect 410 fresh-
men. 423 actually arrived,’’ Manning
said.

Associate Director of Admissions

Julia Kozak attributes the problem to
what she calls ‘‘summer melt.’’

‘Every year we have a number of
students who for whatever reason
decide not to attend Washington and
Lee,’’ Kozak said.

Students are obligated to inform
the university on May 1 as to wheth-
er they will attend W&L. According
to Kozak, 430 students accepted
admission by May 1.

The Admissions office estimated
that 20 students would not show up.
Admissions then informed the hous-
ing office to prepare for 410 fresh-
man.

‘*For whatever reasons, our ‘su-
mmer melt’ was small this year. I
think it was a national trend,’’ Kozak
said.

Freshmen Carrie Southgate and
Rachel Smith share a room the size
of many singles, but don’t seem to
mind the close quarters.

‘The room next door is bigger
than ours and it’s a single,’’ Smith
said, refering to her room on the
second floor of Davis dorm. ‘“‘It’s
worked out well so far. A little
more room might be nice....’’

One word sums up the first few
weeks of the freshman experience:
adjustment.

The class of 1995 has spent the
past five days adjusting to new sur-
roundings, new rules, new friends and
new freedoms. Today they had their
first taste of adjusting to new aca-
demic expectations.

Washington and Lee professors
who teach introductory level courses
have some time-tested opinions on
why freshmen often find the acade-
mic adjustment particularly difficult.

“I think the biggest adjustment I
see freshmen having to make is in
the work load,’’ Assistant Professor
of Chemistry Steven Desjardins said.
“I think there are very few high
schools, public or private, who really
prepare freshmen for a college work
load. It isn’t a matter of intelligence,
it’s a matter of time management.”

Gwyn Campbell, assistant profes-
sor of Romance Languages, also
believes freshmen struggle with the
increased work load and the added
responsibility of completing work
outside of class.

“In most of our beginning level
language classes, it is the student’s
responsibility to learn and complete
grammar exercises before they come
to class,’’ she said. ‘‘That’s quite
different from high school, where
most of the learning is done in
class.’’

Assistant Professor of English
Kary Smout pointed out that a big
part of the academic adjustment from
high school to college is mental.

“Freshmen come in feeling their
writing skills are very good,’’ he
said. ‘‘They have a false sense of
complacency in the beginning and are
usually surprised when their grades
aren’t very high right at first.”’

Campbell sees another major

Tips for academic

Survival at W&L

Keep in mind that this isn’t high school. You probably won't be able to
get by with the same amount of studying you did in high school.

        
   
 

‘Try to keep things in perspective if your grades aren't as high as they
have been in the past. Everyone who made it here is a good student, but
not everyone can be the best.

*Don’t panic if you are overwhelmed at first. There are 400 other
freshmen with anxieties similar to yours.

*Keep a smile on your face and a good sense of humor.

*Do your best not to miss any classes. Absences tend to have a snowball
effect.

*Don’t fall behind in your reading or assignments. Do some work every
day to keep from getting backed up. Cramming 12 weeks into one all-
nighter before exams isn’t much fun, and it doesn’t work very well
either.

*Get to know your professors and talk to them whenever you have
problems or questions. Take advantage of the fact that the faculty at
W&L tend to have an informal open-door policy.

*Don’t be afraid to ask upperclassmen for advice. They have been
through it all before.

*Be courageous. If you have a question to ask during or outside of class,
speak up. Class participation and extra help never hurt.

eLearn to discipline yourself and prioritize. Put your study time to good
use and don’t let anything drag you away from it.

 

‘‘Most freshmen are going to undergo
some sort of crisis of self-esteem.”

Professor Marshall Jarrett of the
history department finds that fresh-
men in his classes have difficulty
delving into a deeper understanding
of the subjects they are studying.

“It’s fairly easy for a freshman to
grasp the basic facts, but it’s a lot
harder to build those facts into inter-
pretations,’’ he observed. ‘‘It’s even

harder to understand and appreciate
and empathize with the idea of his-
tory as a foreign land one visits in a
time warp.”’

Jarrett said professors have to start
slowly and patiently with beginning
students while they develop discipline
and understanding.

Campbell agreed that self-dis-
cipline, patience and organization
skills are the key ingredients incom-
ing freshmen need to develop to be

successful in the college environment.

‘The social element of college is
a very important part of the learning
experience, and it’s very hard to
adjust, organize one’s time, and get a
sense of priority,’’ she said. ‘‘Fre-
shmen need to be aware that time
management and prioritizing are skills
that will need to be practiced, be-
cause they play an important role in
one’s success from the beginning.’’

eAvoid tuming in first draft papers. Take another look at what you've
written and think about how it could be revised and improved before you
turn it in for a grade.

*Don’t be too hard on yourself. Realize there is an adjustment period.

*Relax and have fun. But, don’t forget why you’re here.

Malapropism:
A ludicrous misuse of a word

These misguided quotes were col-
lected by Journalism Professor John
Jennings from papers written by for-
mer students in Journalism 338, Con-
temporary Motion Picture.

If one has to make mistakes, they
may as well be laughable...

“‘a close-up from the waste up.’’

“These years were one of the most
historical periods in our nation’s
history.”’

“An example of this jux of posi-
tions...’’

“He catches the eye of a buxom,
red-headed wrench.”’

** «heroine addiction...”’
** «her timid manor...”’
**...forced to flea the country...’’

‘All tolled, Leni Riefenstahl acted in
nine films.’’

‘*..Gallop pole...”’
“In the climatic scene...’’

' “People will accept only those facts
| which jive with their previous be-
liefs,’’

‘Death is not a new or innovative
concept.”’

“‘As his party travelled the length
and breath of Mexico...’’

‘“‘The lack of narrative in the pro-
logue is what makes the impact quiet
build up to intense action to zero let
down or consequence.”’

‘*...must be put in respective.”’
**...good-verse-evil...”’

‘* .he cuts to shots of wrenched

fists.’’
(on Hitchcock) ‘‘..to capture our
interest in his macabre tail.’’

On November 1, 1901, twelve young men at Richmond College in
Richmond, Virginia banded together to create a new organization that
offered a fraternal experience not available at any of the existing or-
ganizations. Based on the three cardinal principles of Virtue, Dili-
gence, and Brotherly Love, their new fraternity thrived and spread
across the nation. What started with those twelve men has grown to
the largest fraternity in the nation with over 16,000 undergraduates.

Now, almost ninety years later, seventeen men on the campus of
Washington and Lee have decided it’s time to re-create the true frater-
nity experience. Fueled by a new attitude and an internal _re-
organization, Sigma Phi Epsilon is looking to the future. And, our fu-
ture holds a fraternity with the right balance between social, philanth-
ropic, and academic pursuits.

Lofty yet attainable goals have been set that will move Sigma Phi
Epsilon into a position where we will set the pace for W&L’s greek
system in the Nineties. Our National Headquarters has focused great

energy on helping us in any project we desire, while other Virginia
chapters have agreed to lend a hand. Some of our goals have already
been met, such as ridding our pledge program of the degradation of
hazing.

Now, we need a group of men who want to join a fraternity where
they can make a difference from day one. We are looking for a group
of men who are not satisfied with a one-dimensional fraternity experi-
ence. We want men who would rather stand out than simply fit in.

What does all of this mean to you? As a member of the W&L com-
munity, look for Sig Ep to provide support and leadership for campus
activities. As a member of the Lexington area, look to Sig Ep to pro-
mote and support charitable causes.

Finally, as a male going through rush, look to Sig Ep as the only
alternative choice today... and the only real choice tomorrow.

Watch out for the new Sigma Phi Epsilon.

didates to set up the likes of monster
outside hitters Mena McGowin and
Leslie Hess. Senior McGowin and
junior Hess combined fu almost 60
percent of W&L’s kills last year, and
both are poised to be Dittman’s go-
to gals this fall.

Next to McGowin and Hess are
proven performers like sophomore
Tara Burns and senior Marcy Brown,
who were third and fourth respective-
ly in kills last year.

Those letterwinners give Dittman

plenty to feel good about, but not one
of them is the setter that the Generals
will need. That special person is a
mystery, although junior B.J. League
may be just the woman to solve it.
League got a chance to show her
stuff early last season when Jay was
sidelined with injury, and the feisty
Floridian didn’t disappoint. League
came off the bench to dish out 47
assists in 10 games at the Haverford
Tournament in September. League
only saw action in nine games after

that point, so her lack of experience
will be a concern.

The Generals will have to be
strong from the beginning if they
expect to contend again. An ODAC
semifinalist each of the last two
years, W&L will be pushed to the
limits with the addition of Guilford to
the ODAC. The Quakers, along with
perennial powers Bridgewater and
Eastem Mennonite, will make the
ODAC as tough as it’s ever been.

after scoring a school record 32 goals
last season, but there may be nothing
more secure than the W&L defense
this fall. Anchored by three-time All-
ODAC and 1990 All-South sweeper
Nancy Mitchell, the Generals set a
new school record for fewest goals
allowed in a season last year. Hat-
horn would like nothing better than
more of the same in 1991.

Mitchell is back for a fourth
season patrolling the W&L defensive
zone. She will be joined by three-
year letterwinner and 1990 All-ODAC
selection Ashley Hurt. Other defen-
sive key players include striker Aspen
Yawars and fullback Allison Lewis.
both of whom started nearly every
game last year. Multi-purpose player
Ann Shaughnessy gives the Generals
a whatever-it-takes-type of player to
patrol the midfield area.

‘‘Defense will have to be a strong
part of our game,’’ Hathorn says.
‘And that’s good because that’s
where we have the most experience.
Our defense should keep us in con-

tention in all of our games.”’

That’s especially true given the
emergence of sophomore Kate Stimel-
ing as one of the league’s best goal-
keepers. Stimeling, who recorded a
school-record tying eight shutouts,
played every minute of every game
for the Generals last year and set a
school record for best goals against
average at 0.89.

With a number of interregional
contests and the always brutal ODAC
slate, the Generals will be tested
tough in 1991. Two of the best teams
in the South in Methodist and Emory
will come to Liberty Hall Field, and
Hathorn says games like those are
challenges her team is ready for.

‘‘We will run up against some
tough competition this season,’’ the
W&L coach says. ‘But we’d like to
be respected in our region as one of
the best teams, and you have to play
those teams to get there.’’

The Generals open the season
Saturday on the road with a game
against regional power Denison.

the cormerbacks. Also back is pre-
season All-American punter Bob
Ehret.

‘*We knew our defense was going
to be our strong suit, and it has
been,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘The front seven
are playing pretty good football.
We've got some new faces in the
secondary, but we’re pleased with
what they’ve shown us.”’

Falion’s hope is that the team will
not beat itself. The opponents will be

tough enough to beat. ‘We can’t
give away chances against any of the
teams we play, especially not in the
opener.”’

The Generals open Saturday at
Emory and Henry, the pre-season
favorite to win the ODAC. ‘‘We’ll
have to play our best game coming
off the preseason. We’re as green as
we can be offensively, and we're
hoping the defense will keep us hang-
ing tough.”’

efense to lead football in 1991

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

In 1990, Washington and Lee
head football coach Gary Fallon came
into the preseason with a monster
hole to fill. He needed to find a
quarterback to replace two school
record setters on a team where the
only player to throw a pass in a
game was the tailback.

After going 5-5 last season, Fallon
has more, and bigger, holes to fill in
1991, most of them on offense. In
the season opener Saturday at Emory
and Henry, only four offensive play-
ers will be starting at a position they
played last year.

Senior Fred Renneker is back to
run the team at quarterback, and
classmates Jeff Kreis and Jim Henry
are back to catch passes and block,
respectively, and junior Mark Goglia
will again hold down the fullback
position.

To try and fill the void left by
All-American split end Craig Irons,
Fallon had senior George Sakin move
from quarterback, where he started
five games last year, to split end.
Junior Josh Levinson returns as the
tight end, where he was a part-time

starter last season.

After two years as the backup,
junior Wade Robinett will look to fill
the shoes of workhorse tailback
Mason Pope, who was the team’s
leading scorer for three straight years.

While there were big holes to fill
in the backfield and at split end, they
pale in comparison to the holes on
the offensive line. Henry is the only
returning player who saw significant
playing time.

Henry will be joined on the line
by sophomores Derek Boggs and
John Surface, juniors Sean Gatewood
and Evans Edwards, who played all
of last season as a hard-hitting line-
backer.

As many holes as there are offen-
sively, defensively, the Generals may
be as good as they have been in
Fallon’s 13 previous years.

From W&L Sports Information

 

After winning the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference title in 1989, the
Washington and Lee men’s soccer
team slipped in 1990, finishing below
500 and below just about every-
body’s expectations. But looking at
things from a 1991 perspective, last
year’s rough campaign may end up
being just as important if not more so
than the success of 1989.

‘I think we’re going to approach
this season as a team that has ma-
tured considerably from a _ season
where we performed below our ex-
pectations,’” says 1Sth-year head
coach Rolf Piranian, ‘‘I think we
have some mature upperclassmen, and
we'll be able to combine that with
real, solid freshman class. I’m look-

There wasn’t much to look for-

of last year’s 7-8-2 season. W&L
won just twice in its first eight out-
ings last season, and then, just when
things turned a corner, the Generals
suffered a pair of overtime conference
losses.

Of course, there are some posi-
tives that he won’t have to look too
hard to find. First of all, four all-
conference picks from last year return
to this year’s team. Juniors Reid
Murphy, W&L’s leading scorer last
year, and Greg Williams, the league’s
preeminent sweeperback, won first-
team All-ODAC honors last year.
They will be the foundations upon
which Piranian will build his offense
and defense, respectively.

Head coach Janine Hathorn played *
a young team last season, and this
may be the year she reaps the re-

Wilson plans
new bul

Expansion of Reeves Center
could begin in December

 

By Leigh Allen
Staff Reporter

 

Construction of a new front-cam-
pus building to house a collection of
historic porcelains could begin as
early as December.

The gallery is to be built west of
the Reeves Center and north of Tuck-
er Hall. It is to house a donated
collection of antique Chinese furni-
ture, jade pieces and porcelain worth
at least $6 million to $10 million,
said President John Wilson.

Those items and funding for the
building are to be donated by Mrs.
William Watson, said Wilson. Mrs.
Watson and her late husband, Wil-
liam Watson ’29, are longtime bene-
factors of Washington and Lee.

Plans for the gallery are being
handled by Wilson personally, with
little input from W&L’s capital plan-
ning director and faculty.

University spokesman Brian Shaw
said the lack of faculty involvement
in plans for the proposed gallery has
upset some professors. And some
students also are opposed to the idea
of a new addition to the Hill.

“T don’t know why they need
another building to house a ceramics
exhibit,’ said junior Erika Lee.
“‘With all the money that was spent
on the Lenfest Center, I thought they
could have put it over there. That’s

Iding

the arts center.’’

But university officials said dona-
tions will cover the cost of construc-
tion and maintenance. And Wilson
said there’s nothing unusual about the
way plans for the building are being
handled.

‘*‘Mrs. Watson is a dear friend of
the university,’’ Wilson said. ‘‘Be-
cause of the outstanding relationship
that exists between Jim Whitehead,
myself and Mrs. Watson, I thought
that we could handle this project here
rather than through Capital Plann-
ing.”’

Whitehead, director of the Reeves
Center, which houses W&L’s current
porcelain collection, said the center
will remain the same. The new build-
ing will not be directly attached, said
Whitehead.

The architect’s model on display at
the Reeves Center shows a brick wall
separating the center from the new
gallery.

‘‘The wall is a little formidable,
and that plan will be revised,” said
Wilson. ‘‘The wall will be reduced.’’

Twenty students face charges
of underage possession of alcohol
after Lexington police and under-
cover Alcohol and Beverage Con-
trol officers patrolled W&L frate-
mity parties last weekend.

According to police records,
officers charged 16 W&L stu-
dents and four women’s college
students between 10 p.m. Satur-
day and 2 a.m. Sunday.

Lexington Police Chief B. M.
Beard said most of the students
were stopped while the officers
were on a routine patrol around
the corner of Henry and Jefferson
streets, near Red Square.

‘(The officers} sighted one
subject for possession of alcohol

Avoiding the ABC is

W&L students wij} have to change the way they
party if they don’t want to be arrested or fined for
violating state drinking laws.

Generally ABC agents and police officers will only
ticket students who have alcohol outside fraternity
houses or on the street, ABC Special Agent Roger D.
Stevens said. Even students who are 21 may be
charged with drinking in public.

“You know the best way to stop all the viola-
tions? ’’ Stevens said. ‘‘Just stay in the [fraternity]
houses.

“We don’t go in without probable cause. If the
students stay in the houses, we have no need to go
in,’’

However, ABC agents are not prevented from
entering a party if they have reason to believe illegal
activity is taking place inside. Stevens said ABC agents
may legally enter a fraternity party if they either have
a search warrant or have seen a violation occur.

‘‘Remember, I don’t need a search warrant all the
time, and neither do the local police,’’ Stevens said.

ABC agents also may enter a fraternity party if

ABC agents ticket 20 minors

as easy as 1-2-3

they are invited in, Stevens said. For example, if an
undercover ABC agent goes to a party, and a frater-
nity member lets him in, the agent may enter and issue
tickets for drinking violations.

Undercover agents are not required to be honest
about their identities, even if they are asked, Stevens
said. If a fraternity has a guest list, then the agents
shouldn’t be allowed inside the party, even if they lie
about who they are.

‘*We want to give the fraternities the opportunity to
prove that their party is closed,’’ Stevens said.

Most of the students ticketed last weekend were
caught walking down the street with beer bottles or
cans. However, Stevens said agents may not stop a
student for carrying a cup.

“*But if I see a straw-colored liquid with a foamy
head in the cup, then I may have probable cause [to
stop the student],’’ Stevens said. -

Stevens said the best way for fraternities to avoid
problems with ABC agents and police is to follow the
Interfraternity Council guidelines: Keep all alcohol
inside, and have a guest list for each party.

Stevens said these guidelines were agreed upon by
ABC agents, Lexington police and the IFC.

‘‘We’re not requiring the fraternities to do anything
they haven’t been told to do before,’’ Stevens said.

 

 

SAC to study plan
for black fraternity

 

By Rick Peltz

Historically black fraternal or-
ganizations colonizing at W&L will
be a topic at the next Student Affairs
Committee meeting.

Dean of Students David Howison
said that SAC, in response to a re-
quest from students, will study the
feasibility of Alpha Phi Alpha frater-
nity and Delta Sigma Theta sorority
joining the Washington and Lee com-
munity.

‘The goals of historically black
fraternities and sororities are com-
patible with the aims and objectives
of Washington and Lee,’’ Howison
said in a statement of his personal
opinion,

Two students concerned with the
effort to bring a black fraternity to
W&L declined to comment until their
plans are more secure,

Howison said SAC ‘‘approved in
principle the establishment of an
historically black fraternity and/or

mittee must examine several issues to
determine if a new group could in
fact colonize here.

‘*There’s no way I would support
the creation of these fraternities or
sororities outside of our present sys-
tem,’’ Howison said.

At other schools, historically black
fraternities frequently solicit new

accord:

Panhel, Pi Beta Phi to debate
size of sorority’s first pledge class

 

By Jennifer Mayo
Staff Reporter

 

Move over Chi Omega, Kappa
Kappa Gamma, and Kappa Alpha
Theta, because if national panhellenic
and sorority officers can reach agree-
ment on a rush quota change by
October 1, Pi Beta Phi will be the
next sorority to colonize at W&L.

The national leaders of all sororities
presently on campus as well as those
of Pi Beta Phi have been discussing
possible quota adjustments to make
colonization for the new group both
attractive and successful, Washington
and Lee’s Panhellenic President Dale
Wyatt told sorority representatives
Tuesday night.

Quota, the predetermined number
of members that each sorority chapter
aims to gain through rush, can be the
major determinant in a colony’s suc-
cess or failure. As Panhellenic learn-
ed last year, the lack of an effective
quota adjustment contributed to Delta
Gamma’s struggle.

‘*We have realized the importance
of an effective quota change during
expansion,’’ Wyatt said. ‘‘The DG
quota change did not work; we won’t
even try it again.’’

Wyatt reminded Panhellenic mem-
bers that when W&L extended a bid
to Pi Beta Phi last spring, it was
accepted on conditional terms.

Pi Beta Phi National Extension
Vice President Caroline Lesh ex-
pressed the sorority’s concerns re-
garding the strength of a colony.

‘*Pi Phi would like to see a new
chapter at W&L, but we also need to
assure ourselves that it would be
successful in competing with the
existing groups.”’

Lesh said that Pi Beta Phi is
looking to be of equal strength with
the other chapters within two or three
years after colonization. The sorority
is requesting a colony 60 girls, which
could be well over half of all girls
rushing.

But the idea of a colony of that
size does not seem to threaten the
Panhellenic members at W&L, who

 

will welcome a fourth sorority with
open arms.

‘*Kappa, Chi-O, and Theta should
see smaller pledge classes as a
benefit this year, because those three
groups are presently encompassing
the majority of women on campus
and they are getting too big,’’ Wyatt
said.

Despite anticipation on campus,
Wyatt said that the possibility of a
quota cut for the three present soror-
ities is worrying their national of-
ficers.

‘Our nationals are trying to com-
pare our situation to expansions on
huge campuses, like SMU,’’ Wyatt
said. ‘‘They think that smaller
pledge classes this winter might doom
us, but they need to realize our uni-
que size and situation would benefit
from them.”’

The main concern now for all
groups involved is finding an adjust-
ment that will be agreeable to all of
our sororities on the campus and
national level. Wyatt has been in
close contact with all of the con-
cerned national officers and advisors,
and the quota change proposal is out
of Panhellenic’s hands until October
1, when W&L’s Panhellenic must
approve it and present it to Pi Beta
Phi.

‘‘We will try to give them what
they need to succeed,’’ Wyatt added.
‘‘For now, Pi Phi is still anxiously
planning on being here.’’

The new art

The seemingly never-ending expansion of the Washing-
ton and Lee campus marches on. President Wilson has
secured funding for an art gallery to be added to the front
campus. The building, to be built next to Tucker Hall, is to
house a collection of Oriental art that dates from as early as
the sixth century. It is to be called the Watson Gallery
— so named for the gallery’s benefactress Mrs. William
Watson and her late husband of the class of 1929 — and
will be an extension of the Reeves Center. The Reeves
Center currently houses a collection of porcelain artifacts
donated to W&L in the 1970s.

Our first reaction to the proposed building was, ‘“Why
don’t you use the money for something we need more, like
bigger dorm rooms or more parking spaces or maybe
another performing arts center.’’ We imagine that’s what
most students will think at first.

But one doesn’t look a gift horse in the mouth and
expect to get another gift anytime soon. The fact of the
matter is, the money for construction and upkeep of the
gallery was all donated by Mrs. Watson, and it is her
collection of art that the building will hold. According to
Wilson, none of the money for the gallery will come out of
the university’s current operating budget. That is to say,
this money could not have been used to build dorms or
parking lots.

We will reserve judgement on the architectural plan for
the gallery until drawings have been finalized, but we will
say that if the owner of an impressive collection of art
would like to see that collection permanently housed on the
W&L campus, we should all feel honored.

Mrs. Watson could have easily decided to give her
collection to the Smithsonian or the Met. Instead, she felt
W&L would be a fitting place forit to be housed. We believe
this donation, as well as the donation by Justice Lewis
Powell of his papers to Lewis Hall, the Reeves’ donation of
porcelain, and numerous other gifts of historical and cultural
importance, serve only to bolster the prestige of this
university.

Yes, we agree that there are many other things the
university also needs and that Wilson should work to get
those. But, we are also grateful for those unexpected gifts
which come our way and serve only to benefit our
university. The Watson Gallery is one of those gifts.

Maybe you’ve noticed, maybe you haven’t, but the Phi
looks different.

The most noticeable change is probably the appearance of
a sports front on the back. It was our hope that the sports
section, and thus sports in general at W&L would receive
more attention this way. You simply need to flip over the
Phi and you can make believe you’re reading the sports
section of a real newspaper.

Second, W&Life has moved to the center spread of the
paper. This new placement should allow its yet unnamed
editor a little more freedom to display feature stories in an
interesting and eye-catching way.

Also, the page headers are different on all inside pages
and we are making an effort to liven up the front page with
more art and graphics as well as photos and headlines that
tell the story.

If you like the new Phi or if you think it sucks, please
let us know. But please, write us a letter, don’t accost us
at a party or at dinner while we’re all trying very hard not
to let the Phi run our lives.

Hell, music, a

  

 

 

tion allows a
less traumatic
entrance for

international and black students into the W&L com-
/ munity, there have been concerns that the program cau-

ses divisions in the student body at large. It does so by
allowing, or even encouraging students to form cliques,
segregating themselves from the whole of their new
society.

That is a valid concern. Certainly, looking around
myself, I can perceive a degree of stratification in our
W&L society. But can we be sure that the Preorientation
program is a significant contributor to this situation?

Preorientation has laid the groundwork for in-
numerable close friendships. It has aided many students
in adiusting to Lexington and W&L. Is there really
sufficient evidence to warrant the suspension of the pro-
gram?

I trust that the administration weighed the evidence
thoroughly before taking action which might prove detri-
mental to the notion of Preorientation, with all its
potential values.

Perhaps the ‘‘logistics’’ of bringing the necessary
amount of people to W&L early played the largest part
in the decision to suspend Preorientation this year. It
seems the logistical problems outweighed the comfort and
well-being of our international and black students. If that
is the case, the W&L administration ought to rethink its
priorities.

LET IT RIDE
By Chris Swann

 

HELL: the state of standing in line for all
eternity, waiting for a beer you will never drink as
the keg dies right when you grab the tap.

I made up this rather silly definition at a party
before school started last week when, after standing
for fifteen minutes surrounded by smoke and
sweat, I got a cupful of beer suds for my troubles.

I read somewhere that mystics and oracles used
to look for meaning in the entrails of sacrificed
animals, so I stared into my cup for a while as
people shouted at me to get out of their way so
they could get to the now-empty keg. People make
no sense sometimes. Anyway, my suds held no
answers to life’s mysteries, and I was getting a
headache and adolescent flashbacks from Duran
Duran’s ‘‘Reflex’’ which some fool had put on the
stereo, so I wandered into the living room and saw
that the TV was on. Unfortunately, it was on
channel 26.

Whatever happened to MTV? You used to get
The Police and Springsteen and maybe even old
Led Zeppelin clips if you were lucky. Now it’s
guys who all sound alike and rip off lyrics and
music from older, better groups. They call it
‘‘artistic renovation.’’ Sounds sort of like the
renovation of the fraternity houses, and works just
as well. The best is the new Motley Crue video,
‘*Primal Scream.’’ After hearing this, put in a copy
of Whitesnake’s album Whitesnake. (Yeah, I own
one too, it’s OK.) The Crue is ripping off from
Whitesnake, who stole theirs from Led Zeppelin.

I guess it was inevitable; music went from
R&B to white rock to hard rock to heavy metal
to... pretty metal. You know what I mean; big

Orientation praised

To the Editor:

I would like to take this opportunity to thank
publicly the entire W&L community for provid-
ing such a warm and enthusiastic welcome to the
class of 1995 during the Freshman Orientation
program. Of particular importance to the collec-
tive effort was the work of the Freshman Orien-
tation Committee, and its chairman, Michael
Patrick, and the Dormitory Counselors, all of
whom gave unflaggingly of themselves. Planning
and organizing ‘‘ice breaker’’ events and staffing
virtually every orientation event — from place-
ment testing to airport shuttles ~— made for a
very smooth opening week.

Kudos also go to: Jim Arthur and Randolph
Hare and their staff who saw to it that all the
dormitories and other facilities were in immacu-
late condition for Check-in day; Jerry Darrell and
John Taffe and their staff who furnished the
prandial touches for several meetings and special
occasions, including the Friday evening program
in the GHQ; Jim Farrar, Rob Mish, Chris Bara-
del, Southern Comfort, JubiLee, and Gordon
Spice for providing a festive Alumni Association
BBQ and choral program.

 

    

hair, lipstick, glitzy outfits that look like an Elvis
Presley nightmare from the late ’70s. Now I tum
on MTV and get freaks.

On the other hand, we have the ‘‘artistic’’
music celebrities like... Sinead O’Connor. Excuse
me, but isn’t a woman who shaves her hair
because she feels its beauty creates an image that
detracts from her artistic integrity creating an even
bigger self-image by dancing around bald and
objecting to the violence found in our national
anthem? So what if she sang at The Wall concert

beer you will never drink as
the keg dies when you grab
the tap.

in Berlin? So did Bryan Adams, and nobody’s
nominating him for incredible artistic achievement
(although ‘‘Summer of °69’’ has got a catchy
beat...).

Then we have Madonna. I'll give her full
marks for business sense in manipulating 200
million people into buying her product, but I can
rent Debbie Does Dallas for $2.50 and get the
same pleasure as paying $19.95 for Madonna’s
video of her masturbating on stage with two guys
wearing brass bras. (NOTE: I do NOT watch
pornographic movies. My roommate does. I find
them degrading, personally. Sometimes I just
happen to be in the room when he’s watching
them. Purely coincidental. I’m kidding. My
roommate and I are pillars of society. All I know
is, he’s returning the video.)

Some old hands dubbed the Honor System
Orientation Tuesday evening the finest they had
ever witnessed. Stirring remarks by Professor
Sidney Coulling, as well as the urbane tone of
Executive Committee President Giles Perkins and
the rest of EC, insured that freshmen were not
only attentive but were also made more sensitive
to and appreciative of perhaps the most cherished
tradition at W&L.

Others too numerous to mention also con-
tributed to the Freshman Orientation program,
and this note must suffice as a thank you. I am
pleased that the Class of 1995 was the bene-
ficiary of such a community effort!

saddened to learn that Preorientation would not continue +
in its present form for the class of 1995. ‘

The Preorientation program was created chiefly for
incoming minority students and was intended to help
them adjust to the unique settings of Lexington and
Washington and Lee. Essentially, the program brought

You were probably one of the people who made
obscene comments about it to me while filling up

at that keg last week, then hid behind your Village °

Voice and cappuccino when I walked in Saturday
morning for some fruit salad and a baguette to go.

True, I was wearing sunglasses and a rather large ©

fedora, but nobody’s perfect. I mean, look at what
I’m doing with my time.

Then for those of you with a taste of the finer ~

things in life, such as drama, the Lenfest Center is

grand opening (this place held its grand opening
more times last year than the Lexington Police
Department hands out parking tickets). Our student
performances are usually outstanding, and I enjoy
a play right up there with good sex, but did we
really need to pay seven MILLION dollars for a
theater that holds no more people than Lee Chapel?
Isn’t that why we built it in the first place? I’m
getting kind of tired of sitting in the gym as if I
was back in high school in order to see people like
Oliver North and Hunter S. Thompson.

Not to forget the highlight of W&L culture...
Freshmen: don’t forget Fraternity Rush. (How
could you? After that much Coca-Cola you
probably had caffeine withdrawal.) Time to choose
the Greek house of your choice. And if you have
any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask our good
Dean of Fraternities, ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins. He’s the

missed, deeply, still.

Concerning numerous events that have oc-
curred in our profession last spring, Clark would
have been able to provide truly exceptional
insight and counsel.

In a profession noted for outstanding in-
dividuality, Clark was unique. Unlike so many
American news persons, Clark was no cry-baby.
And, for that reason — in addition to his career-
long pursuit of true excellence — he stood out.

Because our profession has been called —
understandably, at times ~ one of cry-babies,
Clark’s absence is painful. The kind of role
model that he created is needed, desperately, by
all today’s aspiring journalists.

Hirshon urges political action

 

Hirshon

 

By Pamela Kelley
Associate Editor

“I swear to God, I am going to
drive my point home, and actions
speak the loudest,’’ said Russell
Hirshon, candidate for the 1992 De-
mocratic presidential nomination.

Tomorrow Hirshon will spread his
word at Washington and Lee.

Hirshon has been touring college
campuses all over the state, wearing
loud suits and distributing outrageous
flyers. One ad features Hirshon sitt-
ing on a toilet in front of the White
House. The caption reads ‘‘Russell
Hirshon’s position on drugs.... Edu-
cate Don’t Dissipate.’’

The 31-year-old Washington, D.C.
native says he knows he cannot be
seriously considered for the Oval
Office, because viable candidates for
the office must be 35 years old.

Hirshon is a bartender and never
finished college.‘‘I don’t aspire to be
great,’’ he said.

marketing/membership for Alpha Phi
Alpha Fraternity, said Alpha Phi
Alpha has neither rushing nor pledg-
ing.

“It’s just qualifications, no rush,”’
Matthews said. ‘‘We outlawed pledg-
ing.”’

Instead, Matthews said Alpha Phi
Alpha has ‘‘information seminars’ to
choose new members on ‘‘just quali-
fications.’ He described the seminars
as ‘‘formal, solemn and rigidly struc-
tured.”’

Matthews also emphasized that
Alpha Phi Alpha, founded in 1906,
accepts member regardless of race. ©

“In 1945 we dropped all refer-
ence to race or color in our constitu-
tion,’’ he said. Non-blacks are ‘‘not
only eligible, but welcome.”’

Though Matthews said Alpha Phi
Alpha tries to meet a school’s re-
quirements, he said his fraternity in a
system like W&L’s regular Rush ‘‘is
like trying to make a round peg fit in
a square hole.

‘We try to comply, but our pur-
pose is different from the other IFC
fraternities,’’ Matthews said. ‘‘Go to
high school, go to college. We try to
influence African-American males and
others to pursue education.”’

Nevertheless, Matthews said Alpha
Phi Alpha will ‘‘without a doubt
provide any information short of the
ritual, even including membership
selection and up to the initiation
process’’ for W&L’s scrutiny.

Howison said SAC will study that
information from both Alpha Phi
Alpha and Delta Sigma Theta, paying

 

 

special attention to grade point re-
quirements, rush and pledging proce-
dures, and the fraternity-chapter rela-
tionship.

Interfraternity Council spokesman
Brad Peterson said a_ historically
black fraternity ‘‘is a great idea’’ for
WEL.

However, Peterson said that any
new men’s fraternity would be
expected to work in the Rush system.

“If you want to be a member of
the Greek system here, you have to
accept and join into the Rush pro-
gram,’’ Peterson said.

A chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha
opened at W&L once before, How- !
ison said, in 1974, but closed after
about three years.

Howison said he could find no
record of why the former chapter
closed, but he suspects ‘‘declining
membership’’ was a factor.

Matthews could not access the
fraternity’s records of the former
chapter by press time.

Despite Howison’s enthusiasm for
the students . interested in bringing a.

eon ye

historically black fraternity Or sorority. !

to W&L, he did assert personal reser-
vations.

“I am concerned with the broader
issue of race in America, and the
present trend that espouses race and
differences ahead of our common
traits as human beings,’’ he said.
‘We can emphasize our differences
too much.

“It would be very unfortunate if
these [organizations] were created and
became the exclusive option for our
minorities,’ he said.

Freshman Marilyn Baker, a black
student, said the presence of a
historically black sorority on campus
would not pressure her.

‘I would not go immediately to a
black sorority,’’ Baker said. ‘‘The
people here [at W&L] have been very
nice to me, and I don’t think there
should be a sorority to divide people
who are racially different.”’

Hirshon says the purpose of his
campaign is not to make fun of elec-
tions. Instead the pro-education, anti-
crime advocate says he is tired of
politicians skirting the issues, and
wants to jolt society’s attention to
issues that matter, like drugs and
schooling.

Hirshon describes his approach as
peculiar, but says, ‘‘It’s better than
sitting still and watching people not
act.’’

Operating on a $6,000 budget,
Hirshon doubts he will qualify for
campaign funds from the National
Election Committee, unlike other
candidates,

“Others started at a half-million
dollars,’ he said. ‘‘If I had that all
hell would break loose.”’

Still, he hopes to visit campuses
in other states and maybe even make
it to the Democratic National Con-
vention.

Hirshon is targeting his message
at college students and ‘‘every uni-
versity that will have me,’’ because

he says students ‘thave more open
minds and don’t know the meaning
of the word can’t.

“If I can make a difference, im-
agine what they can do,”’ he said.

This is not Hirshon’s first run for
public office. He made a bid for
mayor of Washington, D.C. almost
two years ago. That was when Mayor
Marion Barry was secretly videotaped
and charged with using crack cocaine,
then planned another to run for ano-
ther term.

Hirshon said of politics at that
point, ‘‘I was just pushed over the
edge.’’

Hirshon claims he doesn’t care if
people agree with his views, so long
as they become involved.

“If you’re mad at me, then act,’’
he said.

Hirshon will be in Fairfax Lounge
and around campus all day Friday to
talk to students. He will hold one
scheduled meeting for anyone inter-
ested at 2 p.m. in Fairfax.

Library goes

on-line this term

 

By Craig Burke
Assignment Editor

Finding a book at the Washington
and Lee University Library will soon
be as easy as pushing a button.

A new computerized catalog
system will replace the present card
catalog within the next few months,
University Librarian Barbara Brown
said.

“‘We’re phasing out the card
catalog, little by little,’’ Brown said.
“The new system should be on-line
in November.”’

The computerized catalog will
enable students to find library

holdings by typing in key words on
a subject, Brown said. With the card
catalog, students are only able to look
up author, subject, or title.

The new system will also hold a
listing of sources available at the
W&L Law Library, she said.

The Library is encouraging
students to name the new system.
Entry forms are due by Friday, Oct.
11 and are located in the University
Center, the library lobby, and the
Law library. The winner of this
contest will receive a $100 gift
certificate from the W&L Bookstore.

““We're definitely excited about the
new system and all that it can do for
the students,’’ Brown said.

Magazine honors
W&L community

Colonial Homes features Lexington’s
renovated houses and landmarks

 

By Carli Flippen
Staff Reporter

In 1824 the students and faculty of
Washington College gathered to cele-
brate the campus’ new central build-
ing at the laying of its cornerstone.

John Robinson, a wealthy Lex-
ington citizen who paid for a large
portion of the building, donated a 40-
gallon barrel of whiskey for the
event

Today Washington Hall, as_ the
building was later named, stands at
the center of Washington and Lee
University’s Colonnade. The Colon-
nade, overcoming its ignoble beginn-
ing, will receive the Heritage Presen-
tation Award from Colonial Homes
magazine Tuesday.

Colonial Homes is a national publi-
cation devoted to interior design and
architecture. The magazine gives the
award in appreciation of a com-
munity’s work in historic renovation
and preservation to restore buildings
to their original uses.

The city of Lexington, Virginia
Military Institute, the Historic Lex-
ington Foundation, Stonewall Jackson
House and the Willson-Walker House
will also receive similar awards next
week.

“Through our awards for historic
preservation, we are able to express
our appreciation and gratitude to
those who have helped maintain the
magazine's unique perspective on

America’s cultural design and
heritage,’’ Colonial Homes Publisher
E. Michael Peterson said.

**You’ll be struck with this com-
munity’s firm commitment to preserv-
ing the spirit and tangible reminders
of the history that gives their city its
special character,’’ Peterson said.

Colonial Homes dedicated a large
portion of its October issue to Lex-
ington. In addition to the Colonnade,
W&L’s Morris House, the Jackson
House downtown, and two private
homes in Lexington were featured in
the magazine.

The magazine describes the build-
ings’ histories and architectures, and
it includes extensive color photo
spreads.

Lexington Visitor Center Director
Martha Doss reported that visitors
from 14 states and Canada have come
to Lexington as a result of the maga-
zine’s story.

She said the Visitor Center con-
tinues to receive phone calls from
readers across the country who are
interested in visiting.

Lexington is the first Virginia
community to be honored with the
Historic Preservation Awards. In
1983, Colonial Homes saluted the city

Mrs. Lee’s recipes put to ae test

 

From the W&L News Office

 

Gumbo, stew dumplings, sweet-
meat pudding and Mrs. Maury’s
muffin bread.

These are just a few dishes
prepared for the Robert E. Lee family
when when Lee was president of,
what was then known as, Washington
College.

Today the foods are being
recreated in Lexington kitchens, using
recipes recorded in a 119-page cook-
book ledger which is part of the the

Virginia Historical Society’s Lee
Collection.
The ‘‘receipts,’’ as recipes were

called then, were collected by Lee’s
wife from friends and acquaintances
more than 135 years ago.

They were copied down, either in
her own hand or in the script of
friends and family members.

Anne Zimmer, a great-
granddaughter of the Lees, obtained a
photocopy of her great-grandmother’s
recipe book several years ago.

Since then, Zimmer, who is a

free-lance writer in Upperville, Vir-
ginia has been researching the origins
of the recipes and testing them so
they can be re-created with modern
cooking techniques.

Zimmer found that most of the
recipes were collected during the time
the Lee’s lived in Lexington.

She determined this by matching
names of women found in Mrs. Lee’s
journal and some examples of their
handwriting identified with the help
of Virginia Historical Society experts,
W&L librarians, the Federal Bureau
of Investigations and others
knowledgeable about the Lee family.

Zimmer says her book will
provide several glimpses into the
Lee’s domestic and social lives while
they lived in Lexington, as well as
information about the local ladies
who passed their favorite recipes to
Mrs. Lee.

For example, Zimmer said ‘‘After
the Civil War, those southern women
who had been brought up to run
plantations were having to take on
moré= of =the domestic
responsibilities.”’

‘Though the Lees still had ser-
vants when they lived in Lexington,
there was a shortage of trained help,
and even more critical, a shortage of
food,’’ she said.

Zimmer, who has used a wide
variety of material in the W&L ar-
chives to research the cookbook. She
says she’s found enthusiastic support
among Lexington residents, and that
the work seems to have become a
community project.

Lexingtonian Adelaide Simpso
recruited 25 local women to test
approximately 35 of Mrs. Lee’s
recipes. Simpson tried to ask ladies
who were descendents of or in some
way connected to those who were
consulted for Mrs, Lee’s book. Al-
most all of the test cooks are
parishioners of Robert E. Lee
Memorial Episcopal Church, where
the Lee’s worshipped.

Each cook has been instructed to
prepare one or two dishes, following
the recipes as closely as possible,
using modern equipment and
methods.

After sampling each dish, the

cooks freeze the remainder for further
testing. Then, after an honest evalua-
tion of the results, they may alter
each recipe slightly, to improve it or
make it easier to prepare, keeping a
careful record of any changes.

A sample of the second prepara-
tion is also frozen for further evalua-
tion. All procedures are to be careful-
ly recorded, so the ‘‘character’’ of
the dish may be preserved.

Next Friday, the women will hold
a “‘tasting party’’ will take place at
noon in the R. E. Lee Memorial
Episcopal Church Parish Hall.
Simpson and her crew of test cooks
will present dishes made as closely to
the original recipes as possible, for
all to sample.

Zimmer will also be on hand to
taste the concoctions.

“This project has been more of a

treasure hunt than a testing of
recipes,’ said Zimmer. ‘‘In compil-
ing the book of my _ great

grandmother’s recipes, I have learned
a lot about my family and what life
was like for them and other families
after the Civil War.’’

Lenfest Center starts first full season

 

By Jennifer Gladwell
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee’s Lenfest Center for the
Performing Arts will soon begin its first full
season.

The multi-million dollar facility has already
housed over 85 performances since officially
opening its doors in January.

Fine Arts Professor Al Gordon says the facility
has provided much needed expansion for his
department and has enabled the scheduling of more
and better performances.

‘The machine started its engine last year, and
now jt’s really running,’’ Gordon said.

Two Concert Guild performances will be held
at the center in the next three weeks. The Canadian
chamber ensemble will perform Tuesday. A faculty
recital arranged by the W&L music department is
scheduled for Oct. 8.

A newly organized string of performances
called The Lenfest Series, will begin in November.
Gordon described the set of shows as ‘‘an eclec-
tic performance series.’’

Featured in that series will be The San Francis-
co Opera Theatre’s La Traviata, sung in English on
November 17.

A show by The King’s Singers, an English

The Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble, an ethnic,
jazzy, dance group, will perform Feb. 27.

The series is funded by the Lenfest Endow-
ment, the Lenfest Center’s capital campaign, and
the class of 1964.

Also scheduled for the upcoming year are four
productions by W&L Theatre.

Saint Joan of the Stockyards by German
playwright Bertolt Brecht, is set in the bloody,
turn-of-the-century, Chicago stockyards. The play
focuses on the forces of religion and capitalism in
a corrupt society. It was inspired by Upton
Sinclair’s novel The Jungle. It will run at the
Lenfest from Oct. 31 to Nov. 9.

The Perfect Servants by Donald Richie
resembles a style of humorous Japanese plays,
called Kyogen. It will run Dec. 6-10.

True West by Sam Shepard will be staged Feb.
7-12. The slapstick musical A Funny Thing Hap-
pened on the Way to the Forum, by Stephen
Sondheim, will run May 22-28.

Productions by senior theater majors will be
featured in a Festival of One Acts later this
academic year.

MC finally gets
candidates

By Spain Brumby
Staff Reporter

With the Democratic presidential
campaign finally taking shape, Mock
Convention political chairman and
state chairmen are busy at work.

Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder
entered the race for the Democratic
nomination Friday, followed by Iowa
Sen. Tom Harkin on Sunday.

“I’m happy to see we finally
have a_ race,’’ Mock Covention
Political Chairman Jamie Tucker said.

Wilder’s decision to seek the
nomination makes the job of Vir-
ginia’s delegation easier and more ex-
citing, Virginia State Chairman John
Flippen said.

‘‘That will help fundraising efforts
because businesses in Virginia will be
more attuned to the race,’’ Flippen
said. ‘‘Also, it will give our delega-
tion direction in finding out how
Virginia will vote.’’

Harkin’s decision to enter the race
makes the Iowa delegation’s choice
much easier, Iowa State Chairman
Craig Lang said.

‘I’m pretty sure he’ll win the
Iowa Caucus,’’ Lang said. ‘‘Other
candidates won't get early support in
Iowa, so they’ll look toward the New
Hampshire Primary.’’

Tucker said that state chairmen
will contact Democratic leaders and
elected officials in their states this
fall to determine how the states will
receive each candidate.

Car tax hits
freshmen, too

 

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

This year’s freshmen were wel-
comed to life in Lexington this sum-
mer with a notice that they would
have to pay tax if they brought a car.

And indications are that the new-
est class at W&L don’t seem to be
any more willing to pay the tax than
the students already here.

A welcome packet sent out by
city officials included a notice that
students would be expected to pay
personal property tax on any vehicle
they brought with them.

‘The letter said we were required
to register our cars with the city,”’
said freshman Mike Witsil. He said
a card was included with the package
that would ailow students to register
their car by mail.

According to city Commissioner
of Revenue Courtney Baker, fresh-
men who sent the card back then
received a letter explaining that stu-
dents who pay the tax in their home
state or who plan to keep their car at
W&L less than six months might be
exempt from the. tax.

The tax also does not apply to
students who live in houses outside
of the city limits.

Baker said she was not sure how
many responses the city received
from the mailing.

The mailing is the latest move in
a dispute between city officials and
students over whether or not personal
property tax on automobiles should
be paid to Lexington.

The debate began last winter
when officials announced their inten-
tion to collect the 4.25 percent tax on
student cars. They maintain that since
a car used by a student is primarily
kept in Lexington for the majority of
the year, personal property tax should
be paid to the city.

Student leaders countered with the
argument that students contribute

enough to the city’s economy already
and thus should be exempt from the
tax.

Several meetings were held bet-
ween students and city officials last
winter in an attempt to mediate, but

na Wa&L

the meetings failed and _ students
threatened to boycott city businesses.

University officials remained
above the fray, on one hand refusing
to give the city a list of student cars
by citing student privacy rights, but
on the other hand refusing to de-
crease the voluntary monetary dona-
tion the university makes to the city
every year.

Last spring, city employees re-
corded license plate numbers of stu-
dent cars parked around town, traced
the owners, and then sent out tax
bills.

Many students tried to get exemp-
tions by counting vacations and
weekend trips as time away from the
city in order to get under the six-
month limit, a tactic Baker says is
not acceptable.

‘*There’s no sense in sending me
a list of weekends when you weren’t
here,’’ said Baker.

‘*As I read the law and as I un-
derstand the [state] attorney general’s
opinion, if you have your car for the
entire school year, then it can be
taxed,’’ she said.

As for last year’s collection ef-
forts, Lexington Mayor H.E. Derrick,
Jr. said that because the city began
its effort to collect the tax late in the
fiscal year, it ‘‘statistically didn’t
make the numbers’’ that officials
expected to collect.

City Manager Jon Ellestad said
the percent of students who paid the
tax last year was lower than the ratio
for residents and also chalked that up
to ‘‘getting a late start.’” He said he
hopes to ‘‘keep it [tax collecting] to
schedule this year.’’

Ellestad said the city estimates it
will collect $70,000 in student car tax
this year.

However, freshman don’t seem
anymore inclined to pay the tax than
their predecessors.

“I’m not going to pay it unless
they send me _ something,’’ said
Katherine Adams of Pembroke Pines,
Florida. ‘‘My dad said not to do it.’’

Jennifer Burdick said she did not
know if she paid a car tax in her
home state of Texas, but said her
mother told her ‘‘if someone came
after me we'd take care of it.”’

to the sixth century Tang Dynasty,’’
said Whitehead.

“The Watsons lived in China for
quite a while. Their collection is very
impressive,’’ Wilson said.

According to Wilson, the donation
includes over $800,000 to be used in
the construction of the gallery.

Parsons said
authorization
for the building
came directly
from Wilson.

“My office
had very little
to do with this
project. Presi-
dent Wilson
handled most
of it personal-
ly,” Parsons said.

Wilson said the Fraternity Renais-
sance program left Parsons with too
little time to handle the new project.

“Frank Parsons has very much on
his plate at the moment. We want to
focus Frank Parsons on Fraternity
Renaissance,’’ Wilson said.

Wilson said that because of the
timing and nature of the donation, the
Watson Gallery is separate from the
Master Plan normally used for univer-
sity development.

“We had been talking to Mrs.
Watson for a number of years about
making this donation. The three trusts
containing the Watson estate were to
have been donated to the university at

  

eee eee

the time of her death,’’ Wilson said.

Mrs. Watson asked that the money
be transferred to W&L early so that
she could be actively involved in the
new addition, Wilson explained.

Wilson said he hopes the plans can
be finalized for approval at the Oc-
tober meeting of the Board of Trus-
tees, so construction can begin in
December. If that’s not possible,
construction would probably be delay-
ed until next summer.

Construction would last a year,
said Whitehead. The William Hall
Partnership, a New York architectural
firm, is designing the new building.

The president said he sent the
faculty a memo outlining the gallery
proposal at the beginning of fall term.
He said he will make a formal pre-
sentation to the faculty at the next
faculty meeting in early October.

Wilson gave a number of reasons
for not revealing details of the project
to the faculty earlier.

‘‘We only consult with faculty
members who are directly affected by
the project,’’ Wilson said.

‘“‘There’s no conspiracy here. I
have not been trying to hide this
project by any means,’’ Wilson said.

No faculty members were involved
in the construction of Gaines Hall,
and only faculty members in the
drama department were consulted
when the university built the Lenfest
Center, Wilson said.

down the street with a group of
people when she felt a hand on her
shoulder.

“T thought it was one of my

friends, but it turned out to be an
ABC officer, and I had an open
Busch can in my hand,’’ Hardie said.
‘‘The others had beer in cups, so he
couldn’t do anything to them, but
gave us all a lecture about how we
shouldn’t drink.
(op {At, first’ he was kind of ob-
noxious, saying shame on you for
drinking. Then he was a little nicer,
probably because I got hysterical,’’
Hardie said.

“‘They said they were just doing
their job, and that if we were going
to drink, not to do it outside and not
with beer in cans.”’

The president of Phi Delta Theta,
Douglas Lindsay, said one ABC offi-
cer stayed in the Phi Delt yard most
of the night, handing out tickets. No
officers attempted to enter the house,
Lindsay said.

Both Hardie and Lindsay said the
ABC officers were dressed like stu-
dents.

“One was walking up and down
the street carrying a backpack and
looked just like a student. Then he’d
grab someone on the sidewalk and
give them a ticket,’’ Lindsay said.

ABC Special Agent Roger D.
Stevens said he and his partner were
only in plainclothes Saturday, but
wore badges and carried guns to

identify themselves as agents.

Hardie and the other students who
were stopped were not taken to the
police station, but were given a sum-
mons to appear in court in mid-
October. Hardie said the ABC of-
ficer told her the summons was like
a speeding ticket.

Lisa Dunlap, substitute court
clerk, said underage possession of
alcohol is treated as a class one mis-
demeanor, with the fines left up to a
judge. Dunlap said the fines would
probably be $15-25, but Hardie said
she was told her fine could be $50.

The students have the option of
waiving their right to a trial and
paying the fine after their court date,
but she said the fine cannot be pre-
paid, unlike most traffic tickets.

Some students thought the large
number of arrests were unusual.

‘This was the most arrests I’ve
seen since I’ve been here,’’ Lindsay
said. ‘‘It’s the biggest problem we’ve
ever had with people leaving the
party with beers.”’

Stevens said he and his partner
were on a routine visit last weekend
and were not in Lexington because it
was the first week of Rush.

“I didn’t realize it was Rush
week,’’ Stevens said. ‘‘It [the number
of arrests] came as a surprise to us
and to everyone involved.”’

Stevens denied that the arrests,
were a crackdown on students and at-
tributed the number of arrests to the
students’ carelessness.

Generals win F&M Invitational

 

By Sean O’Rourke
Staff Reporter

In 1990, the Washington and Lee
men’s soccer team opened the season
by winning the Franklin and Marshall
Soccer Tournament.

This year the Generals made it
two-for-two at F&M, winning the
season-opening toumament again,
beating host F&M in the final. Unlike
last year’s 2-0-0 start, the Generals
now stand at 1-0-1.

On Sunday, W&L beat F&M on

penalty kicks to win the tournament
for the second straight year. But
under NCAA regulations, since the
game was still tied after two
overtimes, it goes on the record as a
lie.

According to senior Bobby
Weisgerber, though, the team doesn’t
see things that way. ‘‘It was basically
a win,”’ he said. ‘‘We came away
{from the tournament] with two
wins.’’

Both Weisgerber and freshman
stopper Alan Christensen agreed that
the first game, a 2-1 win over York,

Cross country looks
for ODAC double

 

From W&L Sports Information

The Washington and Lee cross
_ country program asserted itself last
season by combining its first-ever
women’s Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championship with an
extremely strong men’s season that
saw the Generals just a few points
shy of a  never-been-done-before
ODAC double.

The success of last year’s seasons
make for high hopes in 1991, and
both men’s coach John Tucker and
women’s coach Jim Phemister enter
this year sporting a certain cautious
optimism.

“Obviously, we have high hopes
for the upcoming season,’’ says Tuc-
ker, who has a_ stable-full of
thoroughbreds ready to go the dis-
tance this season. ‘‘Our team is trem-
endously motivated to do well after
coming so close last year.”’

Phemister can speak from even
higher ground, as his women won the
league title by placing seven runners
in the top 18 spots at last year’s
ODAC Championships. But the
founding father of the women’s cross
country program has his share of
worries.

“‘We could be anything from an
embarrassment after last year’s season
to a team with the potential to be
even better than it was last year,’’ he
says. ‘‘The thing that really makes it
difficult is the paucity of proven
talent. We’ve lost four seniors. How
we do is going to depend on how
those spots are filled.’’

With four of his top five run-
ners back from last season, men’s
coach Tucker should have little
trouble filling the spots on his team.
Leading the way is senior tri-captain
Charles Edwards, W&L’s top runner
each of the last two years. Edwards
finished last season strong by earning
all-region honors. Challenging Ed-
wards at the top will be junior Bo
Hannah, a 1990 AIl-ODAC selection
and all-region selection like Edwards,
whose best time was just two seconds
slower than Edwards’ last year.

That twosome gives W&L a solid
one-two punch up front, but Tucker
has even more talent in reserve. Sen-
ior Lee Parker is a three-year letter-
man who’s run as fast as 27:38 in

his college career. Junior Keith Rinn
had a trio of top-three finishes last
season, and his best race was at the
ODAC Championships.

Aside from the fab four up front,
Tucker’s team will benefit from soph-
omore Jim Gilreath and senior David
Phillips, both returning lettermen and
both ready to step in should the
opportunity arise. A healthy stock of
new recruits is expected to arrive in
Lexington, as well, adding further
fuel to Tucker’s growing optimism.

‘‘We did a lot of work preparing
the summer training schedule,’’ says

the third-year W&L coach. “‘It’s the [J

most ambitious summer we’ve had. I
think that enthusiasm will carry over
into the season.’’

Phemister likewise is hoping for |_

some carryover for his women’s team

this year. Though some of it is un- |

tested, the talent is certainly there. In

fact, Phemister says it may be the |
Generals’ most talented squad ever. |

But there’s a big difference between
what’s on paper and what’s on the
course.

‘*We have some great talent com-
ing in,’’ Phemister says. ‘‘But my
rule is that until they’ve run in col-
lege, I’m hopeful but skeptical.’’

What Phemister does know is that
proven letterwinners Jodi Herring,
Kari May, and Susie Wootton do
return. Wootton, a junior who came

on the scene last year, leads the pack }

after finishing first for W&L five
times in 1990 and earning All-ODAC
honors. Senior Herring and soph-
omore May both were instrumental in
W&L’s victory at the ODAC Cham-
pionships. Behind that group of re-
turners is another group that is over-
due for an impressive debut. Seniors
Nicole Casteel and Jenny Nasser,
junior Betsy Kleiner and sophomore
Lisa Rosiello all ‘‘could be major
contributors,’’ Phemister says.

With a schedule that includes
meets with perennial regional power
Mary Washington, a stern early test
against a strong field at the Dickin-
son Invitational, and a first-ever
Washington and Lee Cross Country
Invitational, both the men’s and
women’s teams will not get a warm-
up lap in 1991. The Generals will
have to be ready, and while it may
not be easy to repeat or go beyond
the successes of 1990, both coaches

a dogfight.

Phemister says in words that Tucker
might echo. ‘‘We have the potential
to be even better than we were last
year. A lot of this comes back to
potential, and there’s a ways to go

an assist in the two games, said the
team showed a lot of character in
both games.

The Generals played shorthanded
in both games. Senior midfielder
David Hooker missed both games,
and against F&M, W&L played two
men down at the end due to ejections
to Murphy and junior Greg Williams.

Head coach Rolf Piranian said the
team showed a lot of character.
“This is a different team from last
year,’ he said. ‘‘The second game
showed that the kids really want to
win and that they have a great deal

of character.’’

Despite the win, though, Piranian
still saw some potential problems.
The team didn’t take good care of
the ball and needed to play better
overall soccer.

The Generals will take to the
home fields at Liberty Hall for the
first time this year on Friday and
Sunday against Carnegie-Mellon and
Johns Hopkins respectively. W&L
will play the Friday game without
Murphy and Williams, who will both
serve the one-game suspension for
being ejected.

Polo looking for most out
of every offensive chance

 

From W&L Sports Information

Washington and Lee water polo
coach Page Remillard likes to say
that he doesn’t have any superstars
on his 1991 team.

Never mind that the Generals can
boast of an all-Southern Water Polo
Conference selection and an All-State
pick, and a total of three Division III
All-Americans, too. No, forget those
guys. The Generals, who were state
champions and Southern conference
semifinalists and finished with a 14-
9 record, did it in 1990 as a team.

Well, come to think of it, that just
might be how Will Davis, Chris
Hagge and Alan Herrick earned All-
America honors in the first place.
And it’s certainly going to be the
way the Generals will have to get the
job done in 1991.

“I think we will continue to move
in the direction that we established
last year of team-oriented success,”’
says Remillard as he begins his 13th
season at the W&L aquatics helm.
‘‘We will be lacking in superstars. If
we do have a superstar, it will be
team defense.”’

Well, while Remillard isn’t calling
seniors Davis and Herrick and junior
Hagge superstars, their career
productivity is doing it for them. And
it is upon their broad shoulders that
the success of 1991 will depend.

Herrick, a defensive stalwart who
scores at will, was an All-Southen
pick in 1990 and has led W&L in
both shooting percentage and steals
each of the last two seasons.

Davis, a defensive stalwart who
scores at will (sound familiar?), was
an All-State pick in 1990 after
leading W&L in goals scored and
finishing second to Herrick in steals.

Hagge, meanwhile, has earned
Remillard’s praise as a bit of a
Michael Jordan for W&L water polo.
Hagge’s offensive skills make him a
bona fide scoring and passing threat.

Those three will play leading roles
in 1991, but their supporting cast is
much more than a_ handful of
Hollywood extras. Sophomore Greg
Golub had an impressive first season,
and he will be the W&L 2-meter
man. Golub forced a team-high 25
kickouts in 1990, and that guile will
need to be part of his game again
this season.

Remillard said he also expects big
things from previous backstage types

like the markedly improved senior
John Kannapell and junior speedster
Andrew Pearson, who showed his
flexibility last season by filling at
goal.

The other key to the W&L unit
will be goalie P.J. Waicus, who is
more than ready to rough up the
waters after sitting out the majority
of last season with an eye injury. The
junior’s 6-4 size and accompanying
wing span make him an almost
prototypical big-time goalie, and he
showed a flash of that brilliance
when he made 12 saves in a game
against Richmond last year.

As Remillard stressed, defense
will be the key for the Generals.
Herrick and Davis combined for over
100 steals last year, and they will
have to pick up where they left off.

And anyone who thinks all the
talk about defense is so much
coaching rhetoric need only look at
the numbers from 1990. W&L was
11-1 when it held opponents to 9
goals or less last season. For a team
that averaged less than 12 goals an
outing, that kind of defense is key.

‘We need to play low-scoring
affairs to be successful,’’ Remillard
says, indicating that controlled tempo
will place a premium on possessions.
‘‘We need to deny our opponents
opportunities and utilize our
possessions effectively.’’

Offensively, W&L will try to use
its speed to great effect. Pearson is
the fastest freestyler at W&L, and
Hagge’s quick moves will be integral
to the Generals’ offensive plans.

‘*We need to accentuate our speed
and conditioning, and we have to get
the most out of every possession,”
Remillard says. ‘‘We need to get as
many kick-outs as we can. This is a
bright team. I think they have the
potential to do that.’’

If the Generals can do that, they
will find themselves in the thick of
the conference championship race
with perennial arch-rival Richmond,
perennial league champion Arkansas-
Little Rock and new league rival
Dayton, host of this year’s Southern
Water Polo Conference
championships.

‘‘Any one of those four will have
a chance,’’ Remillard says. ‘‘To be
successful, we are going to have to
pull off some upsets. We need good
leadership and commitment from our
players. If we get that, the upsets will
follow.”’

W&L comes
back from
early losses

From Staff Reports

 

 

After a slow start, the Washington
and Lee volleyball team rebounded to
win two matches at Shenandoah
Tuesday night.

After losing four matches in the
Gettysburg Tournament over the
weekend, the Generals beat Shenan-
doah 15-12, 16-14 and Marymount
14-16, 16-14, 15-7.

‘We played really well Tuesday
night, especially against Marymount,’
said head coach Susan Dittman. ‘‘We
were match point down and came
back and won the third game de-
cisively. Hopefully, it will be a turn-
ing point for the season. We really
played together.’’

Senior Mena McGowin led the
team with 28 kills Tuesday night to
go with the 68 she registered over
the weekend. Freshman setter Michele
Ralston added 49 assists Tuesday in
five games. In eight games at Gettys-
burg, she had just 39. Junior Leslie
Hess also had a strong showing Tues-
day with 12 kills and 21 digs.

Dittman said the difference in the
turnaround was serve receiving. ‘‘We
made less than two errors per game
on Tuesday,’’ she said. ‘‘We made
twice that at Gettysburg.”’

The Generals host the W&L Tour-
nament this weekend. Matches start at
5 p.m. on Friday and 9 a.m. on Sat-
urday. The Generals play host to
Carnegie Mellon, Goucher, Meredith,
Washington and Jefferson, and Win-

Women’s soccer tops Lync

Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee women’s
soccer rebounded from a season-
opening loss with a solid 3-0 win
over Lynchburg Tuesday on Liberty
Hall Field.

The win came three days after a
2-1 loss at Denison to start the
season. Denison is ranked ninth in
Division II.

Head coach Janine Hathorn at-
tributes her team’s strong play to the
depth of the team. ‘‘The substitutes
and how well they played were really
the key,”’ she said.

Against Lynchburg, sophomore
Karen Stutzmann scored the lone goal
of the first half off an assist from
junior Andrea Cardamone.

In the second half, W&L wasted
little time putting the game away.
Stutzmann scored again off an assist
from junior Susan Moseley at the
41:03 mark, and classmate Corinda
Hankins scored 18 seconds later from
30-yards out to make it 3-0.

From that point on, the defense
took over, led by senior All-South
sweeper Nancy Mitchell and soph-
omore goalie Kate Stimeling, and
kept the Hornets off the board the
rest of the way.

“It was exciting — it’s always ex-

citing to win,’’ said Hathorn. ‘‘We
came very well-prepared to play a
tough Lynchburg team, and we
played a very good game.’’

Hathorn was pleased with Hankins
and Stutzmann, who will again be
looked upon to carry the offensive
burden.

Hathom was also pleased with
Stimeling’s play in the net. ‘‘It
could have changed the whole nature
of the game if she hadn’t made some
of the saves she did in the first
half,"’ she said.

“Tt was fun to see our potential
blossom,’’ she said. ‘‘I feel like
we’re that good, and it’s fun to see it
happen,’’ said Hathorn, who believes
her team’s success comes largely
from the fact that all her players put
in their best effort.

The team was mentioned in the

‘also receiving votes’’ category in
the latest rankings poll.
Against Denison, Cardamone

scored the only goal off an assist
from sophomore Angie Carrington
while Stimeling racked up 15 saves
in goal.

“‘T was really pleased with our
performance,’’ said Hathorn. ‘‘We
played a very tough team very well,
and I’m proud of our effort.’’

Stimeling kept the game even
with another strong performance, the
norm for her first two years.‘‘She

kept us in the game at some really
critical times,’’ Hathorn said. ‘‘I
thought Cardamone also played really
well.”’

The opening part of the schedule
was not an easy one, and Hathorn
was pleased with the way her team
responded to the challenge.

“‘T thought it was a great beginn-
ing,’’ the coach said. ‘‘It was a
tough one, but I thought we did
really well with it. It was the best
way to go.”’

The Generals are now 1-1, 1-0 in
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
play, and the outlook for the rest of
the season is good. Twenty-three of
25 lettermen return from a team
which came just one penalty kick
short of an ODAC title last season.

Despite the early success, Hathom
is not getting too excited too early.

‘*We are taking things like a one-
day-at-a-time team, just to keep
things in perspective. I’m very op-
timistic, but I don’t want to put the
cart before the horse,’’ she said.

Virginia Wesleyan will be the
next ODAC challenger for the
Generals at 2:00 p.m. Saturday at
Liberty Hall Field.

‘Every time we play Virginia Wes-
leyan, they’re always up for it and
very physical. We're expecting a
very tough game,”’ she said.

Wasps blank Generals in opener —

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

Washington and Lee head football
coach Gary Fallon knew that last
Saturday’s season opener against
Emory and Henry would key on his
defense.

“*T just hope that if the defense
bends,’’ he said, ‘‘they don’t break.’’

For 58 minutes, the defense held
strong, but in the 59th minute,
E&H’s Todd Lee scored his second
touchdown of the day, giving the
Wasps a 14-0 lead with 1:52 left.

The game was a defensive strug-
gle, and the E&H offense managed to
keep the W&L defense on the field
long enough to win the game. All
told, the W&L defense spent 36
minutes on the field, compared to just
24 for the E&H defense. E&H ran 77
plays, 64 running, to W&L’s SO.

“I think conditioning was sig-
nificantly in our favor,’’ said Fallon.
‘‘We were able to take the heat,
work hard and still play pretty cred-
ible defense.”’

It was junior Lyle Smith who
sparked the defense, making a career-
high 26 tackles. Senior John McCal-
lum showed his preseason All-Amer-
ica form, recording 15 tackles and a
sack. Seniors Trey Cox and Greg

Kiehl, sophomore Don Dempsey, and

in double figures in tackles.

“Kiehl and [sophomore Phil]

injured Thomas May, also made three
of his tackles in the backfield.

‘‘He made some freshman mis-
takes,’’ said Fallon, ‘‘but he is going
to be a good player.”’

It was the defense that provided
the offense with its best opportunity
of the game. Cox intercepted an E&H
pass late in the second quarter at the
E&H 38 with W&L trailing 6-0.

From there, the offense went on
its lone sustained drive of the after-
noon. W&L used the minning of
junior tailback Wade Robinett and
senior quarterback Fred Renneker to
reach the E&H 6 yard line.

On third down and one, Robinett
was stopped short of the first down,
and on fourth down, Renneker’s pass
was incomplete in the end zone.

E&H took over on their own six
but failed to get a first down, and
W&L almost got another break when

freshman Michael MacLane almost
blocked a punt but ran into the kick-
er, giving the Wasps a first down and
enabling thém to run out the clock.

On the day, the W&L offense
gained just 65 yards, 23 on the
ground and 42 through the air. Ren-
neker completed five of 17 passes
and was sacked four times. Robinett
led the ground attack with 30 yards
on 11 carries.

‘Offensively, we did some nice
things,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘We need to
get sharper on our pass routes and
getting open, but we did a pretty
decent job against a quick, big de-
fense. They were quicker than they
were last year.’’

On the whole, Fallon was pleased
with his team’s performance. ‘‘We
did a lot of nice things considering
they are picked to win the Old Dom-
inion Athletic Conference,’’ he said.
‘‘They are not a bad football team.
They were big, quick and deep. They
used three sets of running backs, and
they all were big strong runners.”’

Lee, who scored on runs of: two-
and 12-yards, was the second string
tailback.

Despite the loss, the team was not
discouraged with the loss. ‘‘We are
not discouraged at all,’’ he said. ‘‘We
prepared hard, and we are a little
disappointed because we went down

there to win and didn’t. But the first ’
thing the team wanted to know on,
Sunday was how could they get
better.”’

Next up for the Generals is the,
home opener against the University of
Alabama-Birmingham, in its first year ‘
of football. ;

W&L doesn’t know that much
about the Blazers except that they are /
big and deep and have a coaching .
staff on a par with many Division I
teams. ,

Former National Football League ,
running back Joe Cribbs and former
Canadian Football League quarterback '
Dieter Brock coach their respective ,
positions.

‘‘They have lost to two pretty’
good teams,’’ Fallon said. ‘‘They’ve ,
got speed, size and quickness and a
pro-style offensive attack where they ‘
throw to the backs. They’ve got 97 ,
kids who are all good athletes.

‘‘We’ll have to keep them from ‘
having success early,’’ Fallon said. ‘‘I ,
hope our defense can come up with
another strong performance, and we °
get our offensive performance ,
going.”’

Knick

gets 10
In pen

. By Cathy Lopiccolo
_ News Editor

 

 

Former Lexington Police Officer
Jerry Knick was sentenced Wednes-
day to serve 10 years in the state
penitentiary for his wife’s murder.

In its Aug. 9 verdict, the jury that
convicted Knick of second-degree
murder had recommended the 10-

year sentence.

During yesterday’s hearing, Rock-

: bridge County Circuit Court Judge

George E. Honts II, rejected defense

' lawyer David Natkin’s motion for a

new trial. Natkin argued that some
evidence in the trial was prejudicial.

“I am satisfied the case was well-
tried. You were well-represented by
your counsel,’’ Honts said.

Honts did agree to a defense
motion that Knick serve his sentence
in a protected environment, since he

, could serve time with people he had

arrested and testified against as a

' police officer.

The sentence comes two weeks
after Honts ordered a_ psychiatric

| examination for Knick. In the court

' indications of mental

order, Honts said Knick ‘‘displays
illness and

; poses a threat to himself.’’

The results of the tests are seal-
ed, but they apparently did not affect
Knick’s sentence.

In August, a jury convicted Knick
of the Sept. 29, 1990, shooting of his
wife, Lisa. Lisa Knick died the next

_ day of a bullet wound to the head.

During the trial, Commonwealth’s
Attorney Eric Sisler claimed Knick
had killed his wife so he could be
with his mistress.

Knick’s attorneys, however, ar-
gued that the shooting was an acci-
dent. The defense said Knick had
taken out his gun because he was
angry to find his wife at home alone
with another Lexington police officer.
They claimed the gun went off when
Lisa Knick grabbed it.

Physical evidence in the case did
not prove conclusively how the gun
went off, but experts said that shoot-

' ing the gun takes deliberate effort.

i

‘

‘

In finding Knick guilty of se-
cond-degree murder, the jury ruled
that the murder was not premedi-
tated, but was malicious.

Knick may now appeal the court’s
decision to the state Court of Ap-

peals.

Tear night:

Behold the sounds of brother-
hood, bonding and beer slides which
will echo all over campus this week-
end on the night all freshmen have
been waiting for, Tear Night.

Those who have experienced the
adventure in year’s past will remem-
ber to wear an old t-shirt and jeans
and expect a crazy time.

“Tear night is a lot of fun, a
little out of hand, but something you
have to live through at least once in

, your life,’’ said senior B.J. League.

Freshman men and women, how-
ever, might not know what awaits

, them. Tear Night traditionally means

that a young man tears his member-
ship bid at the fraternity house of his
choice, thus beginning in a lifetime

" of brotherhood.

Tear Night also connotes tom

EC hears petitions
for student money

Mock Convention request strains coffers

 

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

Campus organizations requesting
funding from the Executive Commit-
tee should not expect to receive any
more money than last year, according
to EC President Giles Perkins.

The EC is holding budget hear-
ings every day this week. They will
deliberate on the requests and pro-
duce a final budget next week.

“It’s not going to be a good year
for any increases,’’ Perkins said.

According to Perkins, the main
reason for the this year’s budget will
be so tight is because of Mock Con-
vention.

Perkins said that in years when
the MC is not held, the EC grants
$4,000 in order to build up for the
next MC,

However, this year’s MC request
is for $16,000, $12,000 more than
usual. Perkins says the EC budget
usually runs ‘‘about $185,000.”’

Perkins said the additional de-
mand on EC money, which is derived
from student activities fees, will mean
that other organizations can expect
the same or perhaps less of an alloca-
tion than last year.

MC is ‘‘an incredible experience
for this school and we’re obligated to
pay for it,’’ Perkins said.

The total budget for MC is pro-
jected to be about $192,000, accord-
ing to data given to the EC by MC

 

Perkins

Administrative Chairman John
Donaldson.
Two other organizations with

significant budget request increases,
insuring that pursestrings wil be tight,
are the Student Activities Board and
Contact.

The SAB is asking for $62,945,
over $14,000 more than the $48,450
it received last year. The additional
money is slated to fund two new
ventures; a series of comedians the
SAB wants to bring to W&L and a
program of showing twice-monthly
movies on campus.

SAB Special Events Chairman
John Flippen told EC members that
the comedian series is ‘‘a big project,
one that we’d really like to start.’’
Regarding the movies, he said that
the SAB would be showing ‘‘second-
run’’ movies, ones that are out of
most theaters but not yet available on
video.

Flippen said the new programs
would probably be cut if the SAB
does not get total funding.

Contact, the organization which
brings speakers to campus, is also
asking for more money than last year.
It is asking for $23,800, $5,800 more
than it got last year.

Chairman Tim Gallagher told the
EC Contact needs the money to make
up for the $10,000 a year previously
supplied by the Interfraternity Coun-
cil, which voted last spring to cease
support of Contact.

Gallagher said Contact is trying to
cut comers already by planning for
speakers to stay at the Morris House
instead of in a hotel and by having
pre-speech dinners catered by the
W&L Food Service instead of going
to a restaurant.

Another demand on the budget are
two new organizations which are
going through the EC budget process
for the first time. The Exhibitionists
Drama Club, a group which travels to
area cultural events and is planning to
sponsor a ‘‘Festival of Arts’’ in Oc-
tober, has requested $1,080.

Another new request has been
made by the W&L chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union for
$2,150. Requests by the chapter last
year for funding for specific events
sparked debates about whether the
ACLU had a political bias.

Past ECs have been reluctant to
fund organizations perceived as politi-

‘The CRC felt that they had an understanding
of the policy,’’ Shaughnessy said. ‘‘But there is
concern on the part of the student body on what
it covers.”’

Shaughnessy said the committee will actually be
continuing a process of review it began last spring
term.
“In the past, the CRC has discussed various
aspects, some of its procedures and the substance
of the [harassment] policy,’’ Shaughnessy said.

Howison and Shaughnessy stressed that the
student body will have a voice in the review.

Executive Committee President Giles Perkins

The Confidential Review Committee will soon
review its controversial policy on harassment.

Dean of Students David Howison said he will
“‘set in motion a formal review of the CRC and
the [harassment] policy’’ in about three weeks.

The current policy ‘‘is ambivalent,’’ Howison
said. ‘‘I hope [the CRC] can clarify it without any
ambiguity.’’

“I'd be very surprised if the CRC emerged
with a single, unanimous opinion,’’ Howison said.

CRC Chairwoman Joan M. Shaughnessy,

Perkins said that he hopes students on the CRC
will be directly accountable to the student body.

‘I would like to see them appointed by the EC,”’

Many faculty members support the idea of a new
building to house a collection of Oriental art but are
divided on where the building should be located.

The proposed Watson Gallery is to house a collection
of antique Oriental ceramics recently donated to the
university by long-time benefactress Mrs. William Watson.

Current plans call for the gallery will occupy a plot of
front-campus land behind the current Reeves Center next
to Tucker Hall.

Faculty members are praising the donation as an
important addition to the art department, but are
concerned over the destruction of the university’s natural
landscape.

“IT oppose the location of the building,’’ Professor of
History J. Holt Merchant said. ‘‘I have no objection to
the university expanding its holdings in art objects. I just
feel that it is important that we leave grass and trees on
this campus. That patch of grass adds a great deal to the
atmosphere of the campus.’’

Merchant added that there are several other things the
university needs more than the Watson Gallery. He cited
increased student aid, an updated student center, and a
science center annex as examples.

Other faculty members share Merchant’s concern.

“I have no objection to the university receiving this
collection. I would just prefer to maintain the open
space,’’ said geology Professor Edgar Spencer. ‘‘The
building would occupy a very prominent place on campus.
I object to its location.”’

University President John D. Wilson responded to
suggestions that the collection could be housed elsewhere.

“This gallery is part of the Reeves Center. It wouldn’t
do much good to have it 400 yards away. I feel that it’s
appropriately located,’’ Wilson said.

Associate Professor of Romance Languages Russell
Knudson believes that the Watson Gallery will be a trem-

Recycling is not
just for ‘e-halls’

Segregation is wrong. All segregation is wrong, and it
seems that the administration is finally waking up to that
fact. Their liberal experiments with dividing the freshman
classes by race and interest have been ended. We hope
they have been ended for good.

We have already praised the administration’s decision
to end the separation of the freshmen class through a
preorientation program which brought international and
minority students to campus early for the “‘special help”’
the administration felt they needed. We now find
ourselves again in agreement with the administration’s
decision to end segregation (albeit voluntary) of the
freshmen halls by interest groups.

Last year’s environmental halls gave incoming freshmen
the chance to voluntarily live on a hall with other people
concemed about environmental issues.

That idea makes you want to say, ‘‘Dean Ruscio, what
were you thinking?’’ Why not house together people who
like gardening? or people who like big trucks with KC
lights?

The freshmen who are concerned enough about en-
vironmental issues that they volunteered to live on the
specialty halls should be admired for their socially con-
scious views.

We should also give those folks some sympathy.

To outsiders, it appeared that the environmental hall
students were banning together for some noble but un-
popular cause. They were therefore segregated.

Students’ willingness to cooperate in the specialty hall
project in fact cost them a fair and equal shot at integra-
tion with the freshman class on the whole.

Moreover, other freshmen were deprived of the chance
to interact with their most environmentally conscious
classmates.

It is certainly possible to promote environmental aware-
ness without specialty halls. The presence of recycling
containers throughout the dorms this year is one way to
do that. Making students aware of activities by The Out-
ing Club’s environmental section is another.

 

 

Simply put, it was stupid for anyone to think they
would promote environmentalism by  cloistering
enviromentalists in a designated hall. We applaud the
elimination. of .‘‘segregated’’ halls and hope we never’ see
their return on this campus. ~a on

Some sort of time-space continuum exists
outside of Charlottesville to dump college stu-
dents at Foxfield, I’m sure of it. I just cruise
around on the backroads until I somehow end
up there (sort of the same experience as finding
yourself at Lee-Hi Truck Stop at 3 a.m. on
Sunday mornings). Just go north on I-81, go
east on I-64, get off at route 250, and head left.

Foxfield etiquette: make sure your fraternity
or sorority has a parking space on the infield,
where the five thousand plus people will be. If
you do not have a parking space, you are a
dweeb and should go home and watch football
on TV like you do every other Sunday.

Also, bring the correct liquor: bourbon and
vodka are key, gin is tolerated. Anyone carry-
ing a bottle that isn’t Beam, Absolut or Gor-
don’s will be loudly and immediately ridiculed.
(Tequila lovers have my sympathies.) You must
pour at least a cup of whatever you are drin-
king down both your shirt and someone else’s
(preferably not your date’s dress, although the
resulting fight would be highly amusing for
everybody else). Be prepared to eat a lot of
fried chicken and potato salad. Wear a really
ugly or individual tie (flowers are good, the
bigger and more garishly colored the better).
Boots are a good idea, unless you like getting
mud all over your nice loafers.

Most importantly, have fun: drink, dance,
talk, scam, whatever.

NOTE: somebody around here has to be
responsible. If you drive, don’t drink. Aside
from drunk driving being detrimental to your
health, and someone else’s, the Virginia High-
way Patrol camps out along the backroads and
I-81 after Foxfield. They have more of a field
day than you do. If no one is willing to drive,
hire a bus and shout at the driver for entertain-
ment. Makes for a really messy trip.

And, of course, the highlight: leaving. This
takes twice as long as getting in, and it almost
always seems to rain. Rule of thumb: make
sure someone in your car is wasted. He or she
will be happy to entertain you all the way back
to Lexington.

Ten years too
little for Knick

MY VIEW
By Rick Peltz

 

 

I went to the sentencing of former Lexington police
officer Jerry Knick yesterday.

Knick was found guilty on Aug. 9 of second degree
murder in the shooting death of his wife.

In Knick’s sentencing hearing, there were no tearful
pleas from family. There was just the account of the
crime, written from a transcript of the trial; a pre-sen-
tence report; and, of course, Knick himself. He looked
depressed — and introspective.

Knick was sentenced to the jury-recommended 10-
year term in the state penitentiary.

Though the Knick case was a rather different crime
by its domestic nature, it did remind me of a case in

Baltimore _last

I note, first,

a crime, then 20

should have gotten.

that I imply no
similarities _ bet-
ween Knick and
Tirado insofar as
whether or not
they regret their
crimes.

Eric Tirado was found guilty last summer of murder
in the shooting death of Maryland state trooper Ted
Wolfe.

With the death penalty a possible sentence and the
sentence mostly in the jury’s hands, Tirado’s family and
friends did testify. They tearfully begged the court’s
mercy, explaining the tragedy that they experienced, not
unlike the tragedy Wolfe’s family faced.

Tirado himself took the stand. He said he regretted
what he had done.

The court ruled that Tirado serve life imprisonment.

One thing the jury did not know was that when
Tirado was led out of the courtroom prior to the sentenc-
ing, he made an obscene gesture at the victim’s family.
It didn’t look then like he regretted the crime.

It’s so easy to look at a convicted criminal in the
courtroom, like Knick or Tirado, and not picture the
brutal crime he committed. It’s hard to give a stern
sentence to the pensive, reticent defendant.

Tirado should have gotten the maximum penalty for
his crime, the death penalty. Knick should have gotten
the 20 years allowed for his crime.

Maybe the jury had doubts about their decision, and
they thought they would make it up to Knick with a 10-
year, rather than 20-year, sentence.

That doesn’t make sense. Knick killed his wife. That
fact was established in a court of law beyond a
reasonable doubt. If the state of Virginia permits only 20
years for such a crime, then 20 years is what Knick
should have gotten. i S

Where is the
Speaking
Tradition?

Senior sees demise
of W&L institution

MY VIEW
By Read Folline

 

 

 

This ‘‘My View’’ was written after a conversation with
fellow senior Jim Cadranell.

Number one, this isn’t supposed to be a sermon.
Number two, this isn’t supposed to be a lecture. And
number three, I may be totally wrong about what I’m
about to say, but as a senior and having been here for
three years, I’ve seen a change take place.

Freshman year, I vividly remember a speech on the
Speaking Tradition. Along with the Honor System discus-
sion, this talk was the other one that really stuck in my
head during that amazingly fun Orientation Week (yes, I
am kidding about
how much fun it
was). Anyway, it
seems to me,
along with count-
less others I have
come in contact
with, that the
Speaking Tradi-
tion is heading
down the com-

 

One of the primary
reasons for my
attending W&L was
how friendly
everyone seemed
to be... | don't

mode, know why this has

a  . enenmed,

 

for my attending

W&L was how friendly everyone seemed to be. I can
recount numerous times of striking up conversations and
new friendships just by speaking to someone on the
Colonnade, in front of the Co-op, and even while walk-
ing around town. I don’t know why this has changed. |
realize the school is much more competitive now, but
that doesn’t mean people have to stop being friendly. We
are here for an education, but we are also here to devel-
op lasting friendships. Hell, how can you make friends
when people either won’t speak to you or have too much
of an attitude to respond to a cordial ‘‘hello’’ or ‘‘what’s
up’’?

The Speaking Tradition is exactly what it sounds like,
for those of you who have never heard this phrase. It’s
a tradition of everyone speaking, and thus being friendly,
to one another. How hard is it to say something while
passing by? I'll tell you one thing, it’s a hell of a lot
harder to not say anything. I just hope this isn’t another
one of W&L’s famous traditions not able to survive in
today’s society. It has lasted for over 150 years... and it
Should last 150 more.

John returns as full-time prof

 

Former dean spent last year in London, Seattle

By Joyce Batista
Staff Reporter

In 1969, outraged by the war in
Vietnam, Washington and Lee stu-
dents orchestrated and participated in
Political protests.

In that same year, Lewis John
began his career as dean of students.
He has had the unique opportunity of
witnessing over two decades worth of
W & L student development.

“Today’s students aren’t as ac-
tion oriented,’ John said. ‘‘They
prefer to work within the system.”’

In spring 1990 he gave up his
post of 21 years to go on a year’s
sabbatical.

Wilder’s
chances
uncertain

By Spain Brumby
Staff Reporter

 

 

Democrats, Viginians, and Wash-
ington and Lee Mock Convention
chairmen agree, it is too early to
determine if Virginia Gov. Douglas
Wilder has a shot at the Democratic

' nomination.

“‘We’ll have to wait and see how
he does in Iowa and New Hamp-
shire,’ Associate Dean of Law Ed-
ward O. Henneman said.

Henneman, who is the head of the
Democratic Party in Rockbridge Cou-
nty, said that although Wilder’s sup-
port is low in Virginia, he appeals to
many middle-of-the-road Democrats
nationally.

Wilder’s approval rating is at 30
percent in Virginia, according to the
latest Washington Post poll.

“‘He hasn’t spent much time in
the state,’’ junior Jeremy Carroll said.
“It doesn’t seem like he is ever in
Richmond being governor.’’

Carroll, a native of Danville, Va.,
also said Wilder’s low approval rating
stems from his cuts in education

‘People in the rural communities
are mad because they were hit the
hardest by the cuts,’’ Carroll said.

Despite Wilder’s low approval
rating in Virginia, Carroll agreed it
was too early to tell how Wilder will
do in his run for the Democratic
nomination.

‘He considers himself a long
shot,’’ Carroll said. ‘‘He is trying to
present himself as a vice-presidential
candidate.”

Virginia democratic office holders,
including the governor, have tradition-
ally spoken at Mock Convention,
according to MC Political Chairman
Jamie Tucker.

‘‘Wilder’s decision to run_in-
creases Mock Convention’s desire to
bring him to W&L for the conven-
tion,’’ Tucker said, ‘‘but it’s too soon
to tell if he’ll get the nomination.”’

‘*What I missed most about W&L
was the involvement with students,’’
John said. ‘‘I just like being here.’’

John spent nearly a year away on
study leave to develop additional
courses. He retumed this fall as a
full-time faculty member.

Professors at W&L are given the
opportunity every five years to go on
sabbatical, John said. They may take
either one term or one year off for
schooling or pursuing academic pro-
jects and interests,

““My wife and I enjoyed travel-
ing,’’ John said.

John spent the 1990 fall term at
the London School of Economics and
Political Science. His winter term
was spent at University College at

Oxford as part of the W&L faculty
exchange
University.

John spent his spring term at the
University of Washington in Seattle.

“‘My wife and I took advantage
of all the cultural opportunites the
cities had to offer,’’ John said. ‘‘We
went to a number of plays and con-
certs.”

John is now teaching a class on
the British political system this fall
and a comparative public policy class
in the spring. He is also serving as
pre-law adviser.

John said his future plans do not
include any more administrative
duties. ‘‘Twenty-one years in ad-
ministration is enough.’’

‘91 alum
added
to staff

By Stacy Bogert
Staff Reporter

 

 

W&L alumnus Christopher Bray,
91, has recently been appointed to
the new position of administrative
assistant for residence life.

As administrative assistant, Bray
will primarily be concerned with im-
proving the quality of student life in
the freshman and upperclass residence
halls.

Bray said his goals for the year
include promoting health education,
increasing opportunities for com-
munity service, enhancing student-
faculty relations, and strengthening
the Dorm League intramural events.

‘‘Basically, Chris is charged with
trying to promote and improve the
quality of residence life at W&L, and
to make it more appealing for stu-
dents, especially upperclassmen, to
live on campus,’’ Dennis Manning,
Assistant Dean of Students for Fresh-
man and Residence Life, said.

Bray éncourages students to sub-
mit their own ideas for activities and
‘said ‘he believes in the power of
students’ ideas.

‘Any ideas, concerns, issues that
arise, they [students] should feel they
can come to any of the dean of stu-
dents staff,’’ Bray said.

‘*When I was a freshman,’’ Bray
said, "I felt like I wasn’t going to
make a difference. I got together with
a couple of my friends and we
thought about what we could do
about drinking and driving. The ideas
formed into Live Drive, an organiza-
tion that provides sober rides on
weekends.”’

As an undergraduate, Bray was a
resident assistant in Gaines Hall and
a dorm counselor in the Summer
Scholars program, 1989-1991.

Of his newest position, Bray said,
‘I've been lucky enough to find a
job with something I love. I love it
here. It’s a special place.’’

Hirshon makes his point

Candidate encourages voter response during W&L visit

 

By Cathy Lopiccolo
News Editor

 

In his red, white and blue striped
suit and American flag shirt and tie,
Russell Hirshon doesn’t look like
your average candidate for president
of the United States.

During his campaign stop at W&L
last Friday, Hirshon didn’t sound like
a presidential candidate either.

“‘All I ask is that people vote.
I’m not trying to get elected,’’ Hir-
shon said. ‘‘I can’t be elected legal-
ly, and I don’t want to be elected.’’

Hirshon, who is too young to be
elected president, said he is running
to make people and candidates more
responsive to issues. The 31-year-old
Democratic candidate said he doesn’t
even care who people vote for.

*“‘Any candidate can make good
changes, and I think the voters can
make a candidate better,’’ Hirshon
said.

‘‘Bush is going to win, but if our
voter turnout is high, then maybe we
can make Bush more responsive.’
Hirshon said he was willing to do
anything and go anywhere during his
campaign to raise the consciousness
of voters.

“‘T'll put myself in debt. I want to
go completely beserk this once,’’
Hirshon said.

A former bartender with only a
high school education, Hirshon said
he doesn’t read books, but he
watches a lot of television and
movies.

He decided to run for president
after watching Rocky, Dead Poet's

reactions,’’ Hirshon said.

W&L students said they liked
Hirshon’s reasons for running, but
they were glad he wasn’t seriously
persuing the presidency.

‘He was really funny. I respect
his taking the time to run with noth-
ing to gain monetarily or otherwise,”’
junior Jimmy Walsh said. ‘‘But I'd
never vote for him.”’

RR RSE SHAG SE ES. SSA UAC OE ce Ft,
“Bush is going to win, but if our voter tur-
nout is high, then maybe we can make
Bush more responsive.”

Society, and Mr.Smith Goes to
Washington all on the same day.

Hirshon began his political career
as a write-in candidate for mayor of
Washington. As a politician, Hirshon
said he has learned a lot about the
American political system and him-
self.

“‘T think the mayoral race was the
first thing I’ve finished since high
school.’’ Hirshon said. ‘‘Now I know
I can finish things.’’

Hirshon commented on the way
W&L students reacted to him.

“IT had expected some negative

— Russell Hirshon

‘“‘He has a basic grasp of prob-
lems but not of how to solve them,”’
junior Andrew Roper said.

‘If he were really running, he might
take votes away from _ other
Democrats and split the vote,”’ said
Roper. ‘‘But he does put a sense of
humor in the race, and that’s someth-
ing we haven’t had a lot of.’’

W&L students might not have
heard the last of Hirshon. Hirshon
said the Mock Convention staff has
talked to him about appearing on the
Washington, D.C., float in the Mock
Convention parade next March.

Wilde comedy featured at VMI

 

From the VMI News Office

 

Oscar Wilde’s classic Victorian
comedy, The Importance of Being
Earnest, directed by Joellen Bland,
opens Thursday, October 3 at 8 p.m.
at the Virginia Military Institute in
Scott Shipp Hail.

A parody of the most revered
values and ideals of the Victorian era,
this delightful play treats trivial things
seriously with sincere triviality.

Family life, love, marriage, man-
ners, education, literature, business,
politiics and even names are parodied
in Wilde’s cleverly contrived comedy
which opened in London almost 100
years ago.

 

 

 

Heading the cast as Jack Wor-
thington and Algernon Moncrieff, two
fastidious young gentlemen of leisure,
are Cadets J. Michael Morris and
James Cherry, both making their
onstage debuts with the VMI theatre.

Specialty halls canceled

 

sy Fran Kefalas
staff Reporter

 

The voluntary experiment with specialty
ialls begun in the freshman dorms last year
vill not be tried again.

The decision to discontinue these types
f halls was made by Kenneth Ruscio,
ormer dean of freshmen and residence life.
it was the first time Washington and Lee
ad attempted such a project, and Ruscio
iid he was ‘‘skeptical of these kinds of
lings.”’

However, he did see it as a chance to
bring together people of different back-
rounds who had a common interest.

Ruscio said the very idea of specialty
alls ‘‘clearly went against the fundamental

yproach to freshman residence life’’ that
&L takes, but in this particular case ‘‘the
otential benefits outweighed the approach.

‘‘An awful lot of really good things came
out of the halls," Ruscio said.

Jody Herring, the women’s dorm
counselor for the environmental hall last
year emphasized the positive aspects of
specialty halls.

“Everybody got along great,’’ she said.

But Ruscio and Herring said that the
forum the halls provided for environmentally
conscious freshmen could easily be found
elsewhere.

‘‘Any freshman can get involved in The
Outing Club,’’ Herring said, which is deeply
concemed with the environment.

However, this was not the only reason for
discontinuing specialty halls.

Ruscio said many of the freshmen had
different expectations of what the
environmental hall would be.

“It was hard to convey to freshmen the
objectiveness of the hall,’’ Ruscio said.

Ruscio said he firmly believes that the
freshman year is not the time for a specialty
hall.

‘‘Freshmen don’t have a reference point
to judge whether this would be a good thing

for them or not,’’ Ruscio said.

Herring, who is a dorm counselor again
this year, said she felt it was important ‘‘to
have people with totally different interests
together.’”

Ruscio said he consulted dorm counselors
and students living on the halls at the time
the decision was made to discontinue the
halls.

However, he said the final decision was
completely his own.

Even so, Ruscio said this doesn’t mean
there isn’t a future for specialty halls at
WA&L.

“I think the ideal time for this is with
upperclassmen,’’ Ruscio said.

Dean of Freshmen and Residence Life
Dennis Manning said he believes in
‘integration rather than segregation,’’ but
would not rule out the possibility of future
specialty halls.

“It would depend on the group of stu-
dents’’ and on ‘‘what their endeavor would
be,’’ Manning said.

endous asset to the university.

“IT think it’s great,’’ Knudson
said. ‘‘These kinds of things do a
great deal for W&L. This gives the
campus an aspect of class that we
capitalize on. Nothing begets money
like money,"’ Knudson said.

Faculty members are not the only
ones who question the location of the
new gallery. Senior Ted Eades
thinks university expansion should be
concentrated away from the Hill.

‘We've got the Lenfest Center,”
Eades said. “I’m in favor of them
expanding the art department, but it’s
too crowded up there as it is.”’

Geology Professor Samuel Kozak
expressed his opinion on the loss of
space.

“It’s an open place at the end of ,,
the campus where there are few open
places,’’ Kozak said. res 8

‘There needs to be a little decen-
y, decorum, and a large amount of
maturity,’’said Atkins.

Atkins and Interfraternity Council
President Greg Hicks reminded the
fraternities at Tuesday night’s IFC
neeting that Tear Night can get out
f control with injuries. They said
hose are not the type of activities a
reshman should experience on the
rst night in his fraternity life.

“I don’t want to hear any horror
stories [about injuries] this year,”’
said Hicks.

“(The bidees] are supposed to
de celebrating their first night of their
\dulthood, without their parents,”’

iid Atkins. Instead, he said, police-
ien show up at fraternity houses
seing people acting like they are in
kindergarten, ‘half-naked, beating on
ots.’

Many upperclassmen remember
heir own tear nights.

Junior Jameson Leonardi re-
calls mantle diving, beer slides and a
lot of fun.

‘It’s probably one of the most
‘xciting nights of the year for
‘raternities,’’ said Leonardi.

Senior Bill Benson recalls his tear
night: he was out at the party, a
brother asked him to tear and then
everyone starting to scream, ‘‘Tear,
tear, tear.’’

Then everyone gathered around
him, and he tore off his shirt.
People poured beer and cups on him,
and soon he was up on someone’s
shoulders.

Benson also provides freshgnen
with some advice about tearing.

‘Don’t let anyone make your
decision for you, think over your
decision before the party,’’ said Ben-
son. ‘‘And if you don’t intend to tear
on Friday, don’t drink a lot.

Sometimes bidees tear at a house
where they did not desire member-
ship, he said.

One junior also provides a bit of
advice that he needed his freshman
year.

‘Don’t wear white boxers because
they cling,’’ he said.

Juniors P.J. Waicus and Fred
Haring suggest tearing between
midnight and 1 a.m.

‘‘Wait until there’s a lot of people
at the party before you tear,’’ said
Haring. He also reminds bidees that
the women at the parties always
notice the men who tear.

“IT had at least ten girls call me
the next day,’’ said Haring.

Freshman Roland Chase from
Idstein, said he’s Germany has heard
lots advice on what to expect this
weekend.

“I’ve heard to wear old clothes.
A girl said [the brothers] will
throw me down the stairs. If that is
what it’s like, fine,’’ said Chase.

One female counsels freshmen
men to try to stay in control and
remember what they’re doing at all
times.

‘Don’t ask someone to Foxfield
and then forget,’’ said the once-jilted
junior.

New weight room rules

 

From Staff Reports

The Washington and Lee Athletic
Department has administered a new
Policy for the weight rooms in both
Gaines Hall and the Doremus Gym-
nasium.

“The Athletic Department formed
a committee to evaluate both the
Gaines and Doremus weight rooms,’’
said Jim Stagnitta, who is in charge
of maintaining the weight rooms with
Gavin Colliton. ‘‘We evaluated the e-
quipment and the rules and regula-
tions to try to make them cleaner,
better organized areas. We wanted to
bring it up to Division III standards
both for students and athletes.’

The main area of adjustments
came through immediate changes.
There were minor changes in the
rules and supervision goveming the
weight room.

‘*The changes are minor,’’ Stag-
nitta said, ‘‘but we need cooperation
from everyone who uses the equip-
ment so the supervisors or work
studies aren’t put in awkward posi-
tions.’’

Most of the time, work study
students will be supervising the use
of the weights. ‘‘The work studies
are there to supervise, help people
with their training and to keep the
room clean. But they are not there to
clean up after others,’’ Stagnitta
stressed.

The new rules are as follows:

eShirts and athletic shoes must be
worn. (No sandals or flip-flops, etc.)

*No food or drinks allowed in the
room. Squirt bottles only.

eNo tobacco.

eBreak down weights and retumn
them to the racks after using them.

Those who don’t comply with
rules or suggestions from the super-
visors can lose their weight room
privileges.

Any problems or concerns can be
brought to either Stagnitta (463-
8678) or Colliton (463-8682).

out starters Reid Murphy and Greg
Williams as they served one game
suspensions for red cards.

Even without two offensive play-
ers, the Generals dominated this game
in terms of scoring opportunities, but
they still came away with only one
goal.

“The team did a great job of
creating opportunities, but they just
weren’t finishing them. It’s both a
mental and technical problem,’’ said
head coach Rolf Piranian about Fri-
day’s game.

The Generals took an early 1-0
lead when junior Kyle Fanning scored
off an assist from Mitchem. Carnegie
Mellon responded later with a goal
set up by their third corner kick of
the first half.

The real hero of Friday’s tie was
senior goalkeeper Lee Corbin. Corbin
made six saves, with the most impor-
tant one being on a one-on-one
breakaway with eight seconds to go
in regulation.

On Sunday against Johns Hopkins,
the Generals had Murphy and Wil-
liams back, but Mitchem was out
with his injury. Even without Mit-
chem, W&L came out flying. They

took the lead 1-0 on an individual
effort by Reid Murphy to keep con-
trol of the ball and get off the scor-
ing shot.

The game-clincher came a few
minutes later as freshman forward
Sam Drennan took a pass from class-
mate Britt Seal and put it past the
Johns Hopkins goalkeeper for a 2-0
lead.

JHU’s only goal came late in the
first half on a giveaway by the Gen-
erals in their own end.

‘‘We’re playing better, but we
could play even better,’ said Piranian
of the weekend. ‘‘We have to elim-
inate dangerous decisions, which
could have cost us both games.’

‘‘Our best soccer was the first 20
minutes of the first half in both
games,’’ said senior tri-captain David
Hooker. ‘‘The team let down after
the first goals. The defense was
good — good coverage and good
communication. But we need more
cohesiveness with the forwards.’’

Murphy explained why the for-
wards haven’t clicked yet. ‘We
haven’t played with our best 11 play-
ers, yet. Greg [Williams] and I were
out Friday, and then Mike [Mitchem]

was out Sunday. We haven't been
able to establish solid communication.
This also hurts because we haven't
been able to be more creative —
we've been just creative enough to
win.”’

In late action yesterday, the Gen-
erals opened their 1991 Old Dom-
inion Athletic Conference season with
a 2-0 win over Guilford.

Murphy opened the scoring with

a penalty kick midway through the
first half. The goal was Murphy’s
team-leading third of the season.
Sophomore Dan Rhodes added the
second goal off a feed from freshman
Eric Tracy. Corbin made four saves
to record his first shutout of the sea-
son.
The Generals’ record now stands
at 3-0-2, 1-0-0 in ODAC play. It is
the team’s best start since the 1964
season when the Generals went 6-0-
0 to open the season.

W&L’s next game will be Satur-
day at Bethany. The team’s next
home game will follow the Bethany
game on Tuesday in another ODAC
contest against Hampden-Sydney at
4:00 p.m.

day against Old Dominion Athletic
Conference opponent Randolph-Macon
Women’s College to try and get their
offense back on track.

Going into the game, Hathorn was
cautiously optimistic about her team’s
chances for a win.

‘*Because of Saturday’s game, we
want to come back and win, but
thinking that it’s going to be an easy
game is an easy trap to fall into,’
she said before the game.

   

‘*You can be the best team on the
field and still lose the game. We
need to prepare for a nameless, face-
less team and just assume that it’s
going to be a tough game.”’

The Generals took Hathorn’s

wariness into consideration. W&L
won the game 10-0, setting a school-
record for goals.

Sophomore Karen Stutzmann led
the offensive outburst, scoring three
times. Hankins added two, and Jeffer-

son had a goal and two assists. uve..
goalie Kate Stimeling got into the
act.

Out of the goal in the second
half, Stimeling scored a goal and
added an assist to cap the shutout
win. W&L out-shot R-MWC 46-3 on
the afternoon.

Next challenger for the Generals,
2-2, 2-1 in the ODAC, will be at
Guilford Saturday.

Volleyball
spikes MBC
in easy win

By Rob Robinson
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Washington and Lee vol-
leyball team opened its Old Dominion
Athletic Conference season with a
convincing win over Mary Baldwin
College Tuesday night.

The Generals took control early
and beat MBC in three straight
games, 15-3, 15-4, 15-11.

Senior outside hitter Mena Mc-
Gowin led the team with nine kills as
W&L improved to 5-7 and 1-0 in
ODAC play. Junior setter B.J. League
had seven assists and freshman Mich-
ele Ralston added six. Senior Marcy
Brown led the way with eight digs.

**We’re looking forward to many
more ODAC wins this year,’’ said
junior Leslie Hess, who added seven
digs.

Hess attributed the win to strong
practices and team unity.

Over the weekend, W&L hosted
its first ever tournament and finished
with a 2-3 record. McGowin had 32
kills in the tournament, and Hess
added 20. Ralston had 79 assists in
the tournament. W&L got its wins
against Meredith and Goucher and
extended both finalists. W&L took
runner-up Washington and Jefferson
to three games and lost a 16-14 game
to Carnegie Mellon.

The Generals will next play in a
tournament at Maryville College this
weekend.

 

Wa&L’s tennis
tournaments

From Staff Reports

 

 

The Washington and Lee
women’s tennis team opened its
1991-92 season with a strong
showing in the W&L Fall Tourna-
ment.

The Generals won two of
three matches, falling only to
Swarthmore 5-4 in the first match
of the tournament. W&L bounced
back to top Sweet Briar 7-2 and
Methodist 3-1. Sophomore Genia
Foster was a perfect 3-0 at No. 1
singles for W&L. W&L also got
a lift from freshman Marilyn
Baker, who went 3-0 at No. 3
singles and 3-0 at No. 3 doubles.
She teamed with senior Brannon
Aden and freshman Elizabeth
McCord in doubles.

The W&L men’s team will
open its season this weekend,
hosting the Rolex South Atlantic
Regional. The winner of the tour-
nament will advance to the na-
tional tournament on Nov. 1-3 in
Corpus Christi, Tex. W&L’s top

Polo drops three at Navy

 

By Andrew Fox
Staff Reporter

 

After an inconsistent start of the
1991 season, the Washington and Lee
water polo team is poised to return to
its mid-season form of a year ago.

After a convincing 14-5 victory
over Villanova in the first round of
the EWPA Varsity Invitational, the
Generals dropped their final three
matches to polo stalwarts Army,
Richmond (9-7), and Boston College.
Inconsistent play in each of the three
losses doomed the Generals’ chances
of bringing home the EWPA crown.

According to senior All-American
Will Davis, the team must play up to
its potential if it wants to experience
the success it achieved last year.

“‘At times we played well,’’ he
said. ‘‘However, we could not put
together a compiete game, especially
against Boston College.’’

For three of the four quarters the
Generals played the Golden Eagles
even, but let the match slip away in
the second quarter in the 9-4 loss.

Davis led the Generals in scoring
with eight goals, four assists and

seven steals. Sophomore Greg Golub
added six goals in the tournament,
and senior Alan Herrick added five.

Sophomore goalie P.J. Waicus re-
corded 35 saves in the tournament,
including 13 against Villanova. Davis
and Golub each scored four goals
against Villanova.

Both Davis and senior Stu Towns
agreed that the EWPA Invitational
showed the players what areas they
need to improve to be prepared for
the remainder of the season.

Said Towns, ‘‘We know what we
have to work on to become more
competitive. | am confident that we
will be ready to successfully face the
strength of our schedule in October
and November.”’

This weekend the Generals host
the Virginia State Championships.
Though arch-rival Richmond is not in
the field, W&L still faces a tough
task to win the tournament. Virginia
Tech, James Madison, Hampden-Syd-
ney, and Lynchburg form the field.

The Generals will play three
matches on Saturday followed by the
championship game on Sunday at
noon.

Cross country falls at
MWC to open season

 

By Jacob Kimball
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
cross country team gained some re-
spect in last Saturday’s meet with
Mary Washington College and also
emerged with an optimistic view of
the season ahead.

The Generals entered the contest
having never before placing a runner
in the top five against a MWC team
at full strength. Freshman Kim Herr-
ing took care of that.

In her first college meet, Herring
gave an astounding performance that
resulted in a third place overall finish
with a time of 20:04.5. Although the
team went down in defeat, there were
plenty of reasons for head coach Jim
Phemister to be pleased with the
Generals’ effort.

Kim Herring’s feat capped an
afternoon that saw the emergence of
a stellar freshman class. The second
and third place finishers were fresh-
men Teresa Lamey, with a time of
22:04.9, and Sue Deutsch, 22:32.9.

SERVICITAR.

The top freshman runners also in-
cluded Brandi Henderson who ran
well in her first ever cross country
meet.

Rounding out the W&L top five
were senior Jodi Herring, Kim’s older
sister, and Nicole Casteel with times
of 22:33.6 and 23:02.1, respectively.
Both runners return from last year’s
ODAC title team and showed Satur-
day that they are going to make
substantial contributions in W&L’s
quest to retain the title.

Another applaudable performance
was turned in by sophomore Kari
May. Her sixth place finish showed
that her work ethic continues to pay
off as she once again improves her
previous time, Phemister said. She
has run every college meet faster than
the one before.

Bolstered by the return of proven
competitors off last season’s team,
and a bevy of young talent, the team
should improve as the group meshes.
The array of accomplishments shown
in the opening meet bode well as this
group takes on the task of repeating ©
as ODAC champions.

For over three quarters on Satur-
day, the undermanned, undersized
Washington and Lee football team
kept the bigger, stronger and faster
Alabama-Birmingham Blazers at bay.

But in the fourth quarter, the size,
strength and speed took its toll on the
Generals. UAB exploded for 22
points in the fourth quarter to earn its
first ever NCAA win, 34-21.

“They were good athletes,’’ said
W&L head coach Gary Fallon. ‘‘You
can’t allow good, young athletes to
get momentum, and that’s what hap-
pened. They were much quicker and
more mobile, even with their size,
than we thought.’’

UAB’s quickness showed most on
defense, where they sacked W&L
quarterback Fred Renneker 10 times,
and at wide receiver, where Manuel
Philpott ran past the W&L secondary
for touchdowns of 32 and 30 yards.
Running back Pat Green also scored
twice while running for 113 yards on
25 carries.

‘Green is as fine a running back
as I hope we’ll see all year,’’ Fallon
said. ‘‘Their quarterback did what he
had to do to sting us.’’

Doug Gann keyed the air-attack
for the Blazers, completing 17 of 27
passes for 214 yards.

W&L took an early 7-0 lead when
junior Wade Robinett scored on a
two-yard run early in the second

quarter. It was W&L’s first score of
the year.

Philpott’s first score gave UAB a
12-7 lead, but W&L scored again
with five seconds left in the first half
to take a 14-12 lead at halftime.
Renneker engineered a five play, 61-
yard drive capped by a five-yard pass
to sophomore Wilson Moore for the
score. On the drive, Renneker hit
senior Jeff Kreis twice for gains of
29 and 26.

W&L got possession when fresh-
man cornerback Jon Wagner caused a
fumble at the W&L 39-yard line.

W&L extended the lead to 21-12
when Renneker hit Robinett with a
14 yard strike for a touchdown mid-
way through the third quarter. W&L
got possession of the ball after junior
Phil Spears recovered a UAB fumble.

UAB scored in the fourth quarter
on Philpott’s 30-yard touchdown
reception, a 10-yard run by Green,
and a 17-yard interception return by
Kevin Holden.

‘‘We scored some points,’’ said
Fallon. ‘‘We made some gains on
their mistakes, but we didn’t make
enough.”’

On the afternoon, Renneker com-
pleted 16 of 38 passes for 178 yards
and two touchdowns. Where the
Generals lost ground, though, was on
the ground. Through the 10 sacks, the
Generals ended up with a school-
record low of -37 yards rushing.

Defensively, W&L made some
mistakes in the secondary, but Fallon
was still pleased.

needs to play
wees than it perry ** Fallon said. ‘‘But
otherwise, John McCallum is playing
like an All-American. And Wagner
was a pleasant surprise.’’

McCallum, a senior defensive end,
made 12 tackles and registered a sack
for his second strong outing in a row.
Wagner made six tackles, caused a
fumble and broke up two passes
before breaking an arm.

“It was a physical game,’ Fallon
said. ‘‘They gang tackled and came
at us with reckless abandon, and it
took its toll. We lost a couple of
good players.’’

Along with Wagner, junior offen-
sive lineman Sean Gatewood damaged
a knee. He was replaced by senior
Steve Fugitte, who played well, said
Fallon, along with the other offensive
line players, despite the sacks.

“I can’t find fault with our ef-
fort,’’ Fallon said, ‘‘and that’s the
first thing we look at on the film.
We weren't discouraged with either
side of the ball. The mistakes we
made were correctable ones. I can see
us getting better each time out.’’

Next up for the Generals is
Centre College. Centre features one
of the best running backs in Division
Ill, Tim McDaniel. McDaniel was a

first-team All-American last year. _

Both teams are 0-2, and Fallon says
this game should resemble every
other game W&L has played against
Centre, a war.

“It’s going to be a real slugfest,
and we better be ready.”’

Cross country falls as

Eagles nip

By Jacob Kimball
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
cross country team got off on the
right foot for the 1991 season with
an impressive showing in a show-
down with powerhouse Mary Wash-
ington College last Saturday.

The Generals, in their first meet of
the season, gave last year’s South-
eastern Regional Champions a scare
as they captured the top two places.
Co-captains Bo Hannah and Charles
Edwards led the charge as they cap-
tured first and second, respectively.
The W&L twosome ran neck and
neck with each other as Hannah's
time of 27:09.3 just bested Edwards’
27:09.6.

Both ran away from the pack. The
next finisher was a lengthy eighteen
seconds behind. Both runners are
coming off strong seasons and left
head coach John Tucker the impres-
sion that they are both ready and
willing to shoulder the attack as the
Generals vie for the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference title.

With Hannah and Edwards leading
the way, the Generals closed the gap
between themselves and the Eagles.
Last year, MWC won by 13 points.
This year, though, the Generals
closed the gap to nine points, losing
25-34.

Tucker noted that this year’s total
of seventy-five miles of running per
week is a considerably more am-

Generals

bitious training schedule than the
teams of the seasons past had en-
dured. This rigorous workload was
reflected in the team’s showing at
their first meet and Coach Tucker is
glad to see that it is ‘‘paying off.”

The freshmen runners, led by
Matthew Brock, showed by their
performances Saturday that they will
be instrumental as the team prepares
to challenge for this year’s ODAC
title. Brock, who finished eighth
overall, was W&L’s third place fin-
isher with a time of 28:13. Based on
his first collegiate meet, Coach Tuck-
er expects him to be ‘‘up with our
top runners’’ as the season progres-
ses.

Tucker said another name to rem-
ember is freshman Doug Boyles who
registered a respectable time of 29:52,
placing him seventh for W&L.

Rounding out the top five finishers
were returning lettermen Lee Parker,
another co-captain, and Keith Rinn
with times of 28:56 and 29:15
respectively. These two join Hannah
and Edwards in forming a solid core
of returners whose experience will be
heavily relied upon as the Generals
make their way up to Carlisle, Pa.,
for the upcoming Dickinson Invita-
tional on Saturday, September 28.

Tucker says his team will be
ready. ‘‘We will be competitive.”’
The invitational consists of several
strong teams, among them Mary
Washington.

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Two women

report

By Cathy Lopiccolo

 

' News Editor

Two women from area colleges
said they were sexually assaulted on
or near the Washington and Lee
campus during the past two weeks.

Neither of the women goes to
W&L, Dean of Students David Howi-
son said, nor has either woman iden-
tified her assailant as being from
W&L.

The first assault occured on the
weekend of Sept. 20-21, Howison
said.

“Our security guards found a
disoriented woman outside Gaines
Hall,’’ Howison said. ‘‘After talking
to her further, the woman indicated
that she had been sexually assaulted
by a man.”’

* Director of Security Michael

, Young said it isn’t clear why the

woman was walking on the W&L

' campus.

The second assault took place
about 4 a.m. Sunday. Howison said

» a young woman was walking between

Sweet Things and Red Square —
where she had been attending a

; party — when she was attacked by

two men and was raped.

description of her assailant, but

assaulted near Gaines Hall knew her
attacker.

As of Wednesday, Lexington
Police Chief B. M. Beard would not
comment on whether his department
is investigating the incidents.

Beard said neither woman has
pressed criminal charges.

‘“‘T want students to know they
should definitely report any similar
incidents to the police,’’ Beard said.

Howison and Young emphasized
that women must be careful while
walking alone.

“Our students must understand
that as wonderful as W&L and Lexi-
ngton are, they need to use common
sense and be careful,’’ Howison said.

Students must be especially care-
ful during the evening and early
morning hours, Howison said. Walk-
ing around alone or intoxicated puts
a woman at added risk, he said.

“If a student for any reason is
uncomfortable, she shouldn’t hesitate
to call our security or the Lexington
police,’’ Howison said. ‘‘It’s better
to err by being over sensitive and
careful.”’

W&L security (463-8498) is
available 24 hours a day and will
drive students home if asked,
Howison said. The Lexington police
phone number is 463-2112.

While Howison said he is pleased
with W&L security, he said he would
like to know student opinions on
additional safety measures, like emer-
gency whistles or better lighting.

“I’m open to any ideas to make
W&L a safer place,’’ Howison said.
‘But awareness and common sense
are some of the most important ele-
ments of safety.’’

SCC follows |

simpler

By Thomas Eisenhauer
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Student Conduct Committee
will follow a simpler and more direct
constitution this year, according to
Dean of Students David Howison.

Howison said the revisions, writ-
ten by the Student Affairs Com-
mittee, were designed to make the
SCC more open and responsible to
the student body.

“*The assessment of SAC was that
overall, students did not understand
the student conduct procedures out-
side the Honor System,’’ Howison
said. This year ‘‘we’re giving the
SCC greater authority.”’

Under the new constitution, the
student body will choose the SCC
chairman in a ‘‘Big Four’’ election
during winter term. That election
will replace the usual ‘‘Big Three’’
election of the Executive Committee
president, vice president, and secre-
tary.

Also, the SCC will release the re-
sults of all its cases, though it will
not reveal names.

Additionally, the Student Affairs
Committee will no longer review
SCC decisions. Instead, a Board of
Appeals now has the power to review
but not overturn SCC decisions. The
board, if it chooses to accept an ap-
peal, can send a case back to the
SCC with commentary for recon-
sideration.

The board includes the dean of
students, Howison; the president of
the EC, Giles Perkins; and the senior
faculty member of the SAC, Profes-
sor Robert de Maria.

The new constitution eliminates
previous distinction between major
and minor offense categories. It also
does away with law school advocates
for the parties involved and replaces
them with advisors.

SCC Chairman Christopher Ha-
ley, 92, said the position of advocate
was abolished to make hearings less
antagonistic and more informal. Ad-
visors, who will be appointed by the
SCC, will counsel those involved in
a case but will not speak in SCC
hearings.

‘Advocates were third-year law
students who came in and turned the

   

rules

SCC into a court room,’’ Haley said.
‘I think we'll be able to get to the
truth a lot easier [now].’’

The review was triggered by the
SCC’s inadequate response to two
important cases last year, according
to Howison. He said SAC felt the
SCC did not effectively handle the
conflict last year between Sigma Phi
Epsilon and Phi Gamma Delta, and
the bottle-throwing exchange between
a Sigma Alpha Epsilon member and
two Phi Kappa Psi members.

‘The SCC’s relationship to those
issues gave us concern about their
effectiveness,’ Howison said. ‘‘It
was time to look at a system that
some felt was not responsive.’’

SAC drafted the new constitution
in May with input from the EC and

Haley

According to the Student Hand-
book, the SCC exists ‘‘to control
student conduct.’’ The body was
created by the faculty, which claims
responsibility for student conduct.

According to the Handbook, ‘‘The
SCC investigates and acts upon com-
plaints of alleged student misconduct
except for violations of the Honor
System or cases which fall under the
jurisdiction of the Confidential Re-
view Committee.

“Its jurisdiction extends to all
conduct in Lexington and Rockbridge
County, including nearby colleges,
and conduct while engaged in Uni-
versity-related activity,’’ says the
Handbook.

Tear Night
to change,
deans say

By Maureen Levey
Staff Reporter

 

Due to an increased number
of injured and intoxicated stu-
dents during the last weekend of
fraternity Rush, Tear Night will
change next year, Dean of Stu-
dents David Howison said.

‘*Many houses acted in an ir-
responsible and dangerous man-
ner,’’ Howison said. ‘I promise
there will be differences in Tear
Night next year.’’

Associate Dean of Students
Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins warn-
ed members of the IFC at its
Sept.. 24 meeting that previous
Tear Night behavior was juvenile
and unacceptable. He urged
students to behave decently be-
cause of the potential danger of
injuries.

Atkins found instead on Mon-
day morming that many injuries
occurred over the weekend despite
his warnings.

their own vomit, she said.

EC slashes requests by $55,000

 

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee tenta-
tively passed its budget Monday after
slashing close to $55,000 from the
requests it received from student

organizations.

Beginning with over $225,000 in
requests, EC members deliberated for
three hours and cut from almost
every organization’s request to pass a
budget of $166,385 plus a Mock
Convention allocation to be deter-
mined later.

The Student Activities Board and
the Student Bar Association took the
biggest cuts. Monday’s session pro-
duced allocations of $49,500 for SAB
and $41,500 for SBA, down from
requests of $62,945 and $47,999
respectively.

While Mock Convention came in
with a request for $20,000, it re-
ceived no money. EC Vice President
Bo Russell said the money for MC
will be allocated on Monday with
funds from last year’s student body
reserve and from the Publications
Board reserve. Russell said MC ‘‘will
possibly obtain $14,000 to $16,000.""

SAB might also get more money,
according to Russell.

‘They won’t get all of what they
asked for, but we want to give them
enough so that they can make a run
at the comedian and movie’’ series

the SAB has planned, Russell said.

Two organizations did not receive
any funding Monday. The EC tabled
a request by the Women’s Basketball
Club, pending an inquiry into whether
the Athletic Department should fund
the team.

Funding was denied to the W&L
chapter of the American Civil Liber-
ties Union. The chapter had re-
quested $2,150.

Looking at a budget proposal
which asked for funding for speakers,
open mike debates, stationery and
field trips for members and officers,
second-year law Rep. Jay Sterne said
that ‘‘only the Speak Outs really
benefit the campus.”’

EC President Giles Perkins said
he had a problem funding a group
affiliated with a national organization
and that the ACLU chapter ‘‘should
want our money as little as we want
to give it to them.’’

The question of funding national-
ly-affiliated organizations came up
again a few minutes later with a
debate over the request by Amnesty
International for $965.

The EC has traditionally given the
Amnesty chapter $100 per year to
cover dues to the national organiza-
tion. The chapter also requested $865
for postage and envelopes.

First-year law Rep. Bill Callahan
said the actions of the Amnesty chap-
ter were ‘‘externally focused’’ and
the W&L community did not benefit

from them. He said he did not think
EC money should be sent to a na-
tional organization.

Sterne said he did not think of the
money as being sent ‘‘out’’ to a
national organization since it would
be used to help students beco:ne
aware of ‘‘things outside the borders
of Rockbridge County.’’

EC Secretary Caroline Wight said
that each group requesting money
from the EC ‘‘should be considered
individually’’ and she supported giv-

ing the chapter $100 ‘‘so that they
can exist on this campus.”’

Though Callahan and Kelsey voted
against granting money to the Amnes-
ty chapter, the chapter was granted
$100.

The funds for the EC budget are
drawn from an account of about
$205,000. This year’s student activ-
ities fees contributed $185,000, with
$15,000 left over from last year and
$5,000 coming from the Pub Board
reserve.

No need for CRC

In case you haven’t heard, the Confidential Review
Committee is reviewing the university’s harassment policy
and, presumably, the committee’s own role in student affairs.
There are a lot of reasons you might have missed this news.

First, everyone has been talking about reviewing the
harassment policy for so long, it’s hard to tell when the
review is actually taking place and when it’s just being
talked about.

Second, the review is not actually taking place, at least
not right now. Officials promise the CRC will take up the
issue in two weeks. This is a review, by the way, that the
CRC chairwoman said started last year.

If all this sounds like a bureaucratic manipulation of
events, that’s because it is. In fact, despite all the agoniz-
ing over W&L’s harassment policy that has graced student
publications not to mention wet the appetites of Richmond
newspapers, nothing has been accomplished.

The CRC remains as mysterious and secretive today as
it was four years ago, despite promises from administrators
and student representatives. Moreover, the revisions to the
harassment policy, if they materialize at all, promise to be
a poor reflection of student opinion. The CRC and its
upcoming revisions are nothing but a slap in the face to stu-
dent autonomy.

The administration argues in error that because third-year
law EC Rep. Jeff Kelsey sits on the CRC, the students will
have a voice in the revision. Though we respect Kelsey’s
ability as an elected representative, his voice is far from
sufficient. The CRC members are faculty, administration
and students who are appointed by President Wilson. And
given the principle of student autonomy, the ultimate fate of
the CRC should be in the hands of students chosen by their
peers. An objective, accurate review of the CRC can only be
conducted by an outside group. The notion that the CRC
will review itself is ludicrous.

There is however, little question as to what that fate must
be. There is neither need nor justification for a trying body
like the CRC at Washington and Lee. There is no case the
CRC can try that cannot be properly handled by the Execu-
tive Committee, the Student Conduct Committee, or a court
of law.

The only bodies that currently have expulsion powers in
matters of student conduct are the EC, in instances of honor
violations, and the SCC, in severe cases of misconduct. Both
of these organizations have clearly defined jurisdictions and
procedures. Both operate with the endorsement of students:

For the’ CRC; in contrast, the rules ate much more vague.
The Catalogue says the CRC handles cases of sexual assault
and ethnic, religious or sexual harassment. Sexual assault
cases belong in courts of law. As for harassment, the
university policy in the Handbook defines that very general-
ly. The definition says harassment includes ‘‘any conduct of
an ethnic, racial, religious, or sexual nature... adversely
affecting an individual’s quality of life.’’ That’s broad
enough to easily violate the principle of free speech. Non-
elected officials behind closed doors should not be allowed
to make decisions about student expulsions with that
definition.

The time has come to do something about the CRC. The
university should turn over the review process to the EC, or
at least one student committee appointed by the EC. That
group’s findings should be heeded.

Much diversity but scant brain function:

 

MY VIEW
By Robert G. Holland

The following excerpts are taken from the August
14 edition of the Richmond Times-Dispatch and is
reprinted here with permission from the author.

Someone committed a dastardly deed when Vir-
ginians weren't looking... The saboteurs infiltrated
an army of surgeons into university communities
and performed lobotomies on many of the presi-
dents, deans, associate deans and special assistants
to the associate deans.

How else but by the implant of some insidious
electronic device in their noggins can one explain

 

dents exhibit scant intellectual diversity by un-
animously mouthing platitudes about the joy of
being ‘‘different.’’

For example, ‘‘I think diversity is just as

important a part of the preparation for practicing
law as learning substantive law.’’

That is an astounding sentence. It says that all

those who studied law at 242-year-old Washington
and Lee prior to its admitting blacks and women
in recent decades received an inferior education
because they studied entirely in the company of
white males. It also says that students who choose

Diversity has become a

 

the dearth of rational uuerances from. the -ggademi- : code word for the use: of 7s

cians’ lips, while instead comes the repetition at"5-
second intervals, 24 hours a day, of just one word:
‘‘diversity’’... ‘‘diversity’’... ‘‘diversity.”’...

Perhaps we should be grateful that the surrep-
titious surgery did not install a more complex syn-
onym for having many kinds or parts or differen-
ces — ‘‘multifariousness,’’ for example...

But then, multifariousness might be preferable
at that, because it sounds like ‘‘nefarious,’’ which
comes closer to the sinister connotation that be-
nign-sounding diversity has acquired in the politi-
cized academy. The average Joe needs no doctorate
in communications to understand that diversity has
become a code word for the use of racial or
gender preferences to gerrymander the composition
of student bodies or work forces.

A noteworthy invocation of the Magic Word
may be found in the annual ‘‘Dean’s Report’ from
the Washington and Lee University School of Law.

Tear Night story
discouraging

To the Editor:

I was more than mildly disappointed by the
tone of your article on Tear Night in the issue of
September 26. By characterizing drunkenness,
risky if not perilous activities, and ‘‘wreaking
havoc everywhere’ as something to be antici-
pated above all else by freshmen, you encourage
your friends and peers to break the law, to
endanger themselves, and to ignore all sense of
decency and consideration for others — students,
faculty and staff, and townspeople alike.

Just look at the language you use — “a
crazy time,’’ ‘‘a lot of fun,’’ (twice) ‘‘beginning
of a lifetime of brotherhood,’’ ‘‘exciting,’’ and
attracting the attention of lots of women who
‘talways notice the men who tear.’’ Is this the
current student generation’s understanding of
Lee’s standard of comportment to which you so
proudly subscribe?

It appears that President Wilson's convocation
plea to the seniors to take seriously their respon-
sibilities of introducing the freshmen to ‘‘us’’
was either missed or completely ignored, by the
seniors and by The Ring-tum Phi. In the future,
please take the high ground and leave the corrup-
tion of new community citizens to a less influen-
tial group.

Sincerely,
Scott Dittman

Defending E-halls,
Preorientation

To the Editor:
After reading your editorial in last week’s
Phi, | was offended by the suggestion that the

 

‘racial or gender preferences
to gerrymander the
composition of student
bodies.

to study at schools that remain basically homogen-
ous — predominantly black Howard University’s
law school, for instance — are being ill-prepared
to practice law.

It says that the ethnic background or sex of

one’s classmates is just as important as delving
deeply into Blackstone’s Commentaries or The
Federalist Papers. That is an idiotic premise...

Evidently, discriminating in law-school admis-

sions for diversity’s sake is peachy keen. The
diversity article concedes that it would be ‘‘naive’’
to think that ‘‘ethnic differences have nothing to
do with admissions decisions,’’ and the good dean
argues himself for the setting aside of Law School
Admission Tests when necessary for The Cause.

 

LETTERS

university’s experimentation with an environmen-
tal hall, or even that a preorientation program for
minorities and international students, was segrega-
tion.

In defense of the Preorientation program, it
does bring together traditionally segregated
groups for a few extra days to adjust to life at
W&L before everybody else gets here. Consider-
ing that a majority of these students have never
stepped foot on this campus before, and will be
the first trip to the U.S. for some, why not let
them have an extra day or two to learn their way
around before tossing them in with 400 other
freshmen where it’s easy for anyone to feel lost,
especially if English isn’t your native tongue.

The university’s brief experiment with an
environmental hall for the freshmen was a wel-
comed change, simply because it gave a few
freshmen a chance to live with people that shared
their same interests. Unlike most universities, all
W&L asks on the dorm application is if you
smoke or not. There is no opportunity to match
people with similar interests, leaving quite a few
freshmen feeling isolated by the time rush is
over. This experimentation at least allowed a few
freshmen an opportunity to meet people they
shared a common interest with, in a way like a
greek-letter organization. Both these programs
had good results and will be missed by many on
campus, especially in years to come.

editors of this paper and its readers that nothing
shady or underhanded transpired this summer.

Mrs. Elizabeth Watson, an elegant woman

who has more than once made Washington and
Lee the beneficiary of her gifts, offered to donate
to W&L her collection of Oriental art and to

alleys, or cloak and dagger schemes to ruin the
‘‘patch of grass’’ beside Tucker Hall.

I would also like to direct attention to the
comment in Mr. Chapman’s letter (issue of
September 26) that the Reeves Center and its
future addition are of ‘‘no educational value’ to
the university. Had Mr. Chapman ever been
inside the Reeves Center, or more closely ex-
amined the proposed usage of the new building,
he would have seen how grossly he has erred in
his judgement. The existing building is host to a
plethora of educational activities — weekly lec-
tures on the decorative and fine arts, various
student research projects, not to mention the
dozens of East Asian studies and fine arts stu-
dents who have attended classes in the center,
Perhaps this information will place the ‘‘educa-
tional value’ of the Reeves Center in proper
perspective.

Ultimately, the purpose of the addition of the
Watson Pavilion is not to needlessly spend
student dollars. As I've previously noted, the
money has been (extremely generously) provided.
Nor is it to depredate our beloved Hill. Rather,
it is to expand the university’s collection of fine
art and give to it the educational and cultural
diversity that it so desperately needs.

Sincerely,
Michelle L. Brien, '94

P.S. — I would like to extend an invitation to
the student body in general to visit the Reeves
Center. Tour hours are weekdays from 10:30 a.m.
to 2:30 p.m., or by appointment. Schedule per-
mitting, I will be more than happy to give you
a tour myself.

Low ranking ‘won’t hurt’ Plans for

W&L’s fall.

Washington and Lee's seven-posi-
‘tion drop in U.S. News and World
Report's colleges rankings will not
hurt W&L’s reputation, said Dan
Murphy, associate director of admis-
sions,

“I doubt that the slight drop we
\experienced will have  signifigant
|impact,”’ Murphy said. ‘As long as
we're appearing in the top 25 — as
lone of the elite liberal arts schools in
the country — we’re in good shape.”’

The magazine named W&L the
| 22nd-best national liberal arts college
jin its fifth annual guide to ‘‘Amer-
jica’s Best Colleges.’’ Last year W&L
was 15th.

Dr. Thomas Litzenburg Jr., '57,

assistant to the university president,
system and found nothing to explain

“It’s hard to see much of a pat-
the movement of schools
inside the top 25,’ Litzenburg said.
‘*Movement inside the group is of no
great statistical significance.”’

Despite the drop, W&L kept its
title as the ‘Best Buy’’ in its cate-
gory. W&L is the least expensive of
the top 25 liberal arts schools.

And this is the more significant
ranking, said Director of Communica-
tions Brian Shaw.

‘*We remain the ‘Best Buy’ in the
country, and that is very positive,”
Shaw said. ‘‘We’ve gotten a lot of
good press coverage out of it.’’

Dean of Students David Howison
agreed with Shaw.

“The important thing is staying
the ‘Best Buy’ among national liberal
arts colleges,’’ Howison said.

The overall rankings compare 140
national liberal arts colleges on the
basis of academic reputation, selec-
tivity, faculty-resources, total financial
resources and student satisfaction.

Many students were surprised by
W&L’s low student satisfaction rat-
ing. But University Registrar Scott
Dittman explained that the magazine’s
computation method, which used the
percentage of freshmen from 1983-
1985 graduating within five years,
does not fit W&L. He said W&L’s
graduation rate, which was about 90
percent last year, has improved stead-
ily since coeducation in 1985.

“I think student satisfaction at
W&L has improved steadily since we
went coeducational,’’ Dittman said.

IM Office says play by’the' rules.

 

By Rick Peltz
Editor

 

Fraternities playing intramural sports at Washington
and Lee will face penalties this year if they do not play
by the rules.

IM Student Director Courtney Penn said the IM office
is cracking down on rules violations it overlooked in the

ast.
r The most common offenses, Penn said, are late rosters
_ and forfeitures.

‘‘We were kind of slack,’’ Penn said. ‘‘If rosters

weren't in on time, well, that was okay. But this year we
_Teally don’t have time for all the goof-ups.’’

Penn said the office will not accept late rosters and
will impose penalties for forfeitures, which are automatic
if a team is not ready to play within 10 minutes of the
scheduled time.

The first forfeiture for a team will cost them eligibility
for the playoffs in that sport, according to the IM rules

‘ pamphlet. The second forfeiture brings a $10 fine, and

subsequent offenses cost $20 each.

Phi Kappa Sigma IM Chairman John McNeer said he
likes the new enforcement policy.

‘When we play small houses they don’t show up,”’
McNeer said. ‘‘It’ll be a lot more competitive if they
have to show.”

Monty Montcrief, IM chairman for Lambda Chi Alpha,
said he also likes the new policy, but he has some
reservations about how teams are grouped.

The new policy ‘‘is good, because it will make it a lot
fairer in some respects,’’ Montcrief said.

But the way houses are scheduled to play each other
seems to pit large houses against small houses early in
each season, he said.

Montcrief said the games would be more exciting if
smaller houses played smaller houses and larger played
larger in the first matches for each sport.

One advantage to rules enforcement, Montcrief said,
is that fraternities will not have an ‘‘anything-to-win
mentality,’’ because everyone will be governed by univer-
sally enforced rules.

houses
approved

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Lexington Planning Commis-
sion last Thursday approved Washing-
ton and Lee’s site plan to build two
fraternity houses in Davidson Park.

The plan will add Sigma Chi and
Sigma Phi Epsilon to the five houses
already occupying the park. The new
buildings are part of Phase Three of
the university’s Fraternity Renaissance
program.

‘We are serving everybody's best
interests in building the new houses,”’
University Coordinator of Capital
Planning Frank Parsons told The
Ring-tum Phi two weeks ago.

The sight plan must win final ap-
proval by the Lexington City Coun-
cil tonight, but Councilman Brian
Shaw has said they rarely overturn
Planning Commission decisions.

The university decided to build
the houses because it would cost
more to renovate the two current
fraternity houses. Renovating the
current houses also would not allow
for separate party facilities, one of
the Renaissance’s goals.

Renovation of SPE’s house would
also require a conditional use permit
from the city, and the fraternity’s past
problems with its neighbors may have
stood in the way of approval.

The two new houses will be built
on the empty field west of the newly

| renovated Kappa Sigma house on

Nelson Street between Estill and
Randolph Streets. A basketball court
will be built between the two new
houses for use by all the Davidson
Park fraternities.

“‘Washington and Lee is very
deficient in informal recreational
spaces,’ Atkins said. ‘‘Fraternity
students are perceived as they are
because they are only seen listening
to loud music and drinking beer. But
until now, there have been no open
spaces where they can do other thi-
ngs.”’

Commissioner Sidney Brown has
opposed the court in the past and ef-
fectively argued against such a pro-
posal last year when it was included
in the site plan for the Red Square
fraternity houses on Henry Street.

. “While I'd’ prefer a site plan.
‘without ‘a’ ‘basketball court; Pm will’
‘ing ‘to compromise,’’ Brown said.

When the university first brought
the plan to the commission last sum-
mer, the panel requested that Parsons
find a way to shield the court from
view and limit the noise traveling
across Nelson Street.

At the commission’s request, Par-
sons included deciduous trees lining
Nelson Street in the site plan, but
doubted if the trees would survive in
the area’s rocky terrain.

The Planning Commission agreed
to approve the plan unconditionally if
the university would voluntarily
retum with an update of its efforts in
about six months.

“If a problem evolves, W&L will
try to be responsible about it, as we
have on other issues. Our record is
quite good,’’ Parsons said after the
meeting.

Gone With the Wind sequel blows into town

 

By Jennifer Latham
Staff Reporter

 

** IU think of it all tomorrow...’

Those famous words uttered by
Gone With the Wind heroine Katie
Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy
Butler may have come to mind for
Alexandra Ripley, who penned the
epic’s recently released sequel.

The sequel to the story written by
Margaret Mitchell, is entitled Scarlett
and has been available in book stores
for more than a week. Despite high
sales, the book has been deemed a
disapointment at best by many critics
and loyal GWTW fans.

Most published critics have agreed
the sequel, which one Washington
Post writer called a ‘‘bodice ripper,”’
does not parallel the original work
and predicted buyers would net pur-
chase the book with great expec-
tations.

Lexington’s two main book stores
The Best Seller and The Bookery LTD
received the book September 25. So
far, the two stores combined have
sold more than 65 copies of the more
than 800-page book.

Shirley Scott, who works at The
Best Seller, said the store has already
receieved feed-back from two readers
who liked it a lot.

‘One customer said it was nice to
be reacquainted with with the charac-
ters,’’ Scott said.

W&L Senior Pamela Kelley
finished the book four days after its
release. Her impression was not as
favorable.

‘The first thing I wanted to do
was pick up the first one and read it
again, so I could wipe the sequel out
of my mind,’’she said.

Kelley said she mainly wanted to
find out if and how Scarlett got her
husband back. She said she disliked
the novel and many times was
tempted to skip most of it and read
the last few pages to find out if the
two reunite.

“I almost regret reading it,’’ she
said, ‘‘but the temptation is there,
and if your a fan of GWTW, you
can’t help being curious about its

sequel.”’
Jeanette Baggs of Lexington, who

has not yet finished the sequel, called
it ‘‘strictly a romance’.

Like Kelley, she recommended
GWITW enthusiasts read Scarlett, not
for its literary value, but to satisfy
curiosity.

Baggs said she thought a writer
other than Alexandra Ripley might
have done a better job.

Ripley was chosen by a commit-
tee of lawyers for Mitchell’s heirs.
The family reportedly decided to
allow a sequel before the patent on
the original expires in 2011, while
members could control its creation
and the profits it would generate.

According to Life magazine Ripley
was chosen from dozens of authors,
one of whom claimed she was Mar-
garet Mitchell incarnate. Ripley, a
Charleston native appealed to
publishers because of her successes
with southern historical novels like

One Leaving Charleston and New

Orleans Legacy.

The sequel where its predecessor
left off more than fifty years ago. The
year is 1873 and 28 year-old Scar-
lett, the novel’s manipulative, spirited
protagonist, and the tomorrow she
refused to think about has arrived.

Scarlett has just been abandoned
by her husband Rhett Butler, who
utters some of the most famous
words in literary history: ‘‘My dear,
I don’t give a damn.’’ (Frankly was
added in the movie.)

According to Kelley and Baggs,
the book centers on Scarlett’s day to
day activities and her obsession with
getting Rhett back. Scarlett retreats
briefly to her homeplace Tara, then
follows Rhett to his hometown, Char-
leston, South Carolina and a string of
misunderstandings and missed oppor-
tunities ensue.

The bulk of the novel takes place
in Charleston or Savannah, Georgia
and Ireland, where Scarlett journies to
meet her relatives.

According to published interviews
with Ripley, the authoress decided to
emulate Mitchell’s writing style and
further develop some of her charac-
ters through the first part of the
book.

The second half, which introduces
a slew of Scarlett’s relatives and
many new characters in Ireland, and
is more economically oriented, ‘‘is

In the same interview Ripley said
she did this in part because ‘‘it was

what was called the post-Civil War

her to set most of the story in
Ireland, where Scarlett’s family

Boswell published in Playboy

Visiting instructor's fiction article is published in magazine’s October issue

 

By Joyce Bautista
Staff Reporter

 

“‘What was the big deal?... It's
like I've been in restaurants or what-
ever and a woman will walk in, and
from out of nowhere thes little voice
will say, ‘| wonder what she looks
like naked.’ You know the voice I'm
talking about? It's the same one that
Says, ‘I wish I had a million dollars,’
or, ‘I'd like to punch this guy in the
leeth.’ "’

--from ‘‘Bottoms Up”’

Here’s another wish: Imagine you
are a finalist in a writing contest
sponsored by Playboy magazine.

Pictures that may come to mind
are those of scantily clad women
named Bambi hovering over you as
you relax with an alcoholic beverage
by Hugh’s (you and Mr. Hefner are
on a first name basis of course)
refreshing pool.

Marshall Boswell, a visiting in-
structor and 1988 Washington and
Lee alumnus, came closer than most
to that vision almost five years ago,
when he won third place in the
magazine's annual College Fiction
Contest. :

His story, entitled ‘‘Object Per-
manence’’ did not make it into

Playboy, although it was published i.
the 1987 issue of W&L’s literary
magazine, Ariel.

The piece deals with a teenager
named Michael Baker who has a
crush on a girl in his psychology
class, Boswell said. She takes him to
a new wave club and then she dumps
him for an old boyfriend.

Contrary to many of his fricnds’
expectations, Boswell’s reward for
“‘Object Permanence’’ didn’t involve
any string bikinis, but it probably
opened up at least one opportunity
the suits couldn’t.

Although that story never graced
the pages of Playboy, the magazine’s
November issue will feature another
piece by Boswell.

‘Bottoms Up,’’ according to
Playboy, is about a college graduate
who gets a new kind of education
from the street-wise strippers who
happen to be his next-door neighbors.

Boswell’s ‘‘appearance as a
‘regular’ contributor (rather than as a
student) marks our first buy from a
former contestant,’ said Playboy.

According to Boswell, his latest
published work from two real live
strippers who actually did live next
door to him.

‘They were hilarious," Boswell
said. ‘‘After going over and talking
to them, I would rush back to my

apartment and start typing what they
said."

Boswell is teaching two sections
of English 105 and a creative writing

‘course at W&L, as part of an inter-

nship for his doctorate. He is also
currently working on a novel en-
titled, ‘‘Falling and Ascending
Bodies.’’

“It’s a romantic comedy,’’ he
said.

‘‘The division between writing and
teaching is not so great,’’ Boswell
explained.

“Teaching freshmen writing
teaches me about writing. I constant-
ly leam new _ things in the
classroom,’’ he said.

Writing Center opens soon in Payne

 

By Ann Knop
Staff Reporter

 

The university will soon open a
new Writing’Center in Payne Hall.

The center, which opens October
15, will be available to students who
want to tighten up their penmanship,
as well as those who have real dif-
ficulties drafting their papers.

Tutors will be available in the
center 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesday
through Thursday.

According to Professor George
Ray, acting head of the English de-
partment, the center will be an
upgraded version of the university’s
existing writing lab with student

  

tutors.

Assistant Professor and Writing
Center Director Kary Smout, says its
tutors will no longer just proof-read
or edit papers for students, but try to
teach them how to improve thier
writing.

Smout hopes to bring in tutors
who enjoy writing and have a var-
iety of backgrounds.

‘‘We want people who are aware
of other kinds of writing outside of
English,’’ said Smout.

Tutors will attend weekly training
sessions to help them counsel stu-
dents more effectively.

The change in the tutoring
program is part of a new Writing
Across the Curriculum program,
designed to help professors teach

writing.

Ray said that the university over-
all is ‘‘doing a fairly decent job, but
could do better, in the amount, types
and quality of writing.’’

“This Writing Center will
gradually grow as we see how many
students are coming,’’ said Smout.

Senior Chris Swann, who tutored
at the Writing Center last year, said
‘“‘people in every department are
going to need help in writing. I just
hope that people come to use the
Writing Center. It’s a great asset to
the school.’’

Students may sign up for appoint-
ments on the bulletin board outside
of the center.

Professors may also refer students
to the lab with notes to specify the

Students will be expected to ac-

received help from the Writing Cen-
ter.

“Our policy is to have a friend

“drinking themselves and don’t want

; Students are often left for the
‘nurses in the Infirmary to monitor.

Asbury said that at one point Friday
night she was admitting two students,
working on one student, and taking
calls from Stonewall Jackson.

Associate Dean of Students Anne
Schroer-Lamont said drunks often
need medical help.

‘‘But what an awful burden to put

on one night nurse,”’ she said.

Dean of Students David L. Howi-
son agreed.

“The purpose of the Infirmary is
to care for those who need help,’’ he
said. ‘‘Certainly weekends like tear
weekend test the limits of the Infir-
mary personnel.’’

 

RUSH

from page 1

 

Howison said that last weekend’s
_activities are not something in which
» students can take pride.

IFC President Greg Hicks said
“Tear Night was ‘“‘ridiculous,’’ espe-
cially because of the complaints from
Stonewall Jackson Hospital's emer-

gency room.

“If a real emergency had come in
there with all those drunk people,
who knows what would have hap-
pened,’’ Hicks said.

Atkins told the IFC about the
situation with intoxicated students in
the emergency room.

“Think of how you're going to
feel if some local man dies of a heart
attack in the emergency room because
the staff is busy with a bunch of
drunks,’’ Atkins said. ‘‘There’s noth-
ing they can do at the hospital that
will cure immaturity, stupidness and
drunkenness.”’

Atkins said that fraternities should
feel responsibility for the students’

injuries this weekend.

“You ought to feel some respon-
sibility whether or not it occurred at
your house,’’ Atkins said.

Hicks said he is concerned about
the future of Tear Night if problems
continue.

‘‘We might have to go to a for-
mal Tear Night with a coat and tie,”’
Hicks said.

Student opinion of this year’s
Tear Night was generally positive,
but many students expressed concern
about the dangers and injuries.

“‘T thought it was cool, but that’s
only because | didn’t participate in
any of the things I could have gotten
hurt at,’’ freshman Megan Talbott
said.

Junior Susie Wootton said, ‘‘I
wish there was another way of having
Tear Night without anyone getting
injured.’’

Freshman Jamie Cann was one of
those injured.

‘“‘T had a concussion and blacked

sion.”’

Howison said, ‘‘Tear Night is be-

far as what we can lear for the
future. I hope we can do better next
year.”’

The IFC also reminded repre-
sentatives that pledgeship does not

Hicks said. ‘‘If we mess up, we'll

Hicks said in closing that deferred

Health Committee
plans programs

 

By Jennifer i“
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee’s Health
Education Committee plans to address
topics such as alcohol and drug
abuse, sexual decision-making and
healthy eating through a variety of

programs this year, according to
Associate Dean Anne _ Schorer-
Lamont.

“Tt is essentially a student or-
ganized program,’’ Schorer-Lamont
says. ‘‘Aside from the money that the
university provides as a budget, the
students make the decisions on which
programs and speakers that they will
pursue.”

The committee has used their
$11,000 budget in previous years for
programs such as Alcohol Awareness
week, Substance Abuse week, Sex
Education week, and a heart-related
health program.

Last year W&L hired Jan Kauf-
man, a health educator from Duke, to
work part-time with the committee.

According to Schorer-Lamont, this
year, committee members and peer
counselors will be trained to present
health programs in the freshmen
dorms.

The committee also plans to ex-
iend Alcohol Awareness to a one
month study. They will be sponsor-

Phi. Kapps aid
special olympians

 

From staff reports

 

Area Special Olympians got a
little practice help from members of
the Phi Kappa Sigma House Wednes-
day.

The Phi Kapps hosted nine play-
ers from the Buena Vista and Rock-
bridge County Special Olympic Vol-
leyball Team for a few games in the
Phi Kapp volleyball pit.

The leader of the Special Olympic

team said she called the Phi Kapps
and asked if they would play the
team because the team needed some
competition to prepare for the upcom-
ing state Special Olympics.

The team practices about two
hours a week and last year won a
gold medal at the state tournament.

She said the Special Olympics are
a non-profit organization providing a
forum for competition for mentally
handicapped people. The organization
is non-profit and ‘‘always looking for
volunteers to help,’’ she said.

 

ing a suicide teleconference in col-
laboration with 300 other campuses
later this month, which will include a
panel of doctors and students talking
about signs of suicide.

In November they plan to bring to
campus the Offstage Theatre from
Charlottesville to present ‘*But I Said
No,”’ a play about acquaintance rape,

Schorer-Lamont says that their
budget allows for some interesting
programs and well-known speakers,
but without more student interest and
participation, no amount of money
will be able to educate the com-
munity.

‘‘We can never have enough stu-
dents on the committee. I would like
to see representatives from every
group on campus — greek men and
women, law students, international
students, freshmen and _— upper-
classmen,”’ said Schorer-Lamont.

‘*Health education is available
here at W&L, and with the high
statistics of drinking, drugs, sexually
transmitted diseases and pregnancies
on college campuses, I would hope
that people want to learn the options
and the consequences of their be-
havior,’’ Schorer-Lamont said.

The committee meets every Thurs-
day at 3:00 p.m. in the Arlington
Women’s Center and the whole W&L
community is invited and encouraged
to attend, she said.

Russian
reflects on
coup

By Stacy Bogerty
Staff Reporter

 

 

In August, the world watched as
hard-line members of the Soviet com-
munist party attempted and failed to
overthrow President Mikhail Gor-
bachev.

A young Soviet who saw the coup
attempt is an exchange student at
Washington and Lee, and shared his
views on his nation’s time of uncer-
tainty.

‘‘The coup was like a bad

, parody of a coup ih a novel, but it,

wasn’t funny,’’ said Leo Morozov,
from Ulyanovsk, Russia.

“It was like everything stopped
in one day. I was sure there was
nothing good in our future,’’ said
Morozov.

By August 21, the waiting was
over as Gorbachev and Russian
Republic President Boris Yeltsin
regained control and Soviet republics
called for independence.

‘‘These changes should have been
done a long time ago,’’ Morozov
said.

However, Morozov said he is
optimistic about the future. When
asked about the direction the Soviet
Union is taking, he said, ‘‘The right
one.’’

Cross country gets
faster by the week

 

By Jacob Kimball
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
cross country team followed up last
weekend’s impressive opening act
with another respectable showing at
the Dickinson Invitational in Carlisle,
Pa.

The Generals finished sixth over-
all against an eight-team field stock-
piled with quality competition.

While the Generals made ‘‘Great
strides as a team,’’ head coach Jim
Phemister also noted that every run-
ner turned in improved personal.

The team was again led by fresh-
man Kim Herring, whose time of
20:61 was good enough to place her
18th overall. Herring improved her
previous week’s time, but she was
not the only one.

Every W&L runner in the meet

personal records.

**That’s our best individual perfor-
mance in two years,’’ said Phemister.

Nicole Casteel joined Herring in
the sub-21 club, finishing second on
the team in 20:59, a personal best.
Also finishing in the team’s top five
places were Teresa Lamey, 21:37;

Generals hard-luck losers AMEE oRHeMontH
Stimeling keeps |

foes out of goal ;

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

If the Washington and Lee foot-
ball team hadn’t had bad luck in
Saturday’s 24-7 loss to Centre Col-
lege, it wouldn’t have had any.

That would have satisfied head
coach Gary Fallon just fine.

In the first quarter, W&L’s Bob
Ehret hit a punt that appeared to roll
out of bounds inside the Centre 1-
yard line, but the officials ruled the
ball hit in the end zone.

In the second quarter, W&L
‘couldn’t field a kickoff because a
short kick took a bad bounce and
Centre recovered.

After gaining momentum in the
second half, a receiver is hit while
catching a pass and the ball ends up
in a Centre defenders arms for an
interception.

’ “The kickoff and the punt call
.were bad breaks, but we can’t make
excuses for the loss,’’ said Fallon.

It was the second quarter that did
the Generals in. Centre ran 30 plays
in the quarter to W&L’s 10, keeping
the W&L defense on the field for
‘6:33 in a row and 10:17 all told.

The Colonels scored on a 27-yard
pass from Jeff Ratanapool to Eric
Horstmeyer and then, after recovering
the bad-bounce kickoff, on a 1-yard

‘run by Tim McDaniel to take a 17-
0 lead into halftime.

‘‘We didn’t get much going in the
first half,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘We dropped
some passes that hurt us, and we
never threatened them.”

At the half, W&L had managed

 

 

 

Jon Orndorff
..9 tackles & fumble

just one first down and 19 yards of
total offense.

In the second half, W&L started
strong. After the defense forced the
Colonels to kick after three plays, the
offense took over.

Senior quarterback Fred Renneker
engineered the most impressive drive
of the season, taking the Generals 70
yards in 13 plays. Junior Wade Rob-
inett capped the drive with a touch-
down dive from two-yards out.

On the drive, junior Mark Goglia
carried for 23 yards on three carrie.,
and Renneker hit seniors George
Sakin and Jeff Kreis and freshman
William Probst with key completion
before Robinett scored the touch-
down to cut Centre’s lead to 17-7.

Given new life, the defense held
again, and the Generals got the ball
back after a punt on the Centre 49.

Then disaster struck. On second
down, Renneker’s pass was knocked
loose from Sakin and intercepted by

 

   

Lyle Smith

Centre.
‘We got things together early in
the second half,’’ said Fallon.

“Everything was clicking. Our offen-
sive line was firing out and moving
people off the line. We were getting
big completions, and then the air
came out after we tumed it over.”’

After the interception, W&L never
crossed midfield again, getting only
as far as its own 32.

Centre used a ball-control offense,
led by All-American tailback Tim
McDaniel, to run out the clock. In
the second half, McDaniel carried 17
times for 57 yards and a touchdown.
The touchdown came in the fourth
quarter with 2:19 remaining against a
defense that spend 36 minutes on the
field.

“If we had put another drive
together in the second half, we would
have gained confidence and made
them worry,”’ said Fallon. ‘‘It would
have made them wonder if they could

“It was the greatest team. perfor-
mance since I have been here.’’
That’s how Washington and Lee
men’s cross country coach John Tuc-
ker enthusiastically reflected upon the
Generals’ strong showing at the Dick-
inson Invitational last weekend.

Led by junior Bo Hannah, W&L
placed third out of five very tough
teams that included nationally-ranked
nemesis Mary Washington College.

Hannah stayed near the front of a
field of highly competitive runners
and finished second overall, only
fourteen seconds off the pace. He
finished in 26:10.

Hannah was not alone as a top
overall finisher. He was joined by
ever-consistent senior co-captain

Charles Edwards, who recorded a
personal best of 26:28 to place him
fifth overall and second on the team.

For the second straight meet,
Matthew Brock came in third for the
Generals. His personal best of 27:01
placed him eleventh overall. Brock
showed considerable improvement as
he finished ahead of three MWC run-
ners that finished ahead of him the
week before.

Senior David Phillips also posted
a personal record time of 27:47.
That put him just ahead of W&L’s
fifth finisher, junior Keith Rinn,
whose time was a career best of
28:02.

Eight of the 12 W&L runners
tumed in personal records as the
team showed it is solid from top to
bottom. Rounding out the top eight
are senior co-captain Lee Parker,
freshman Doug Boyles, senior Frank

Martien, sophomore Matthew McCol-
lum and freshman Larry Hautau.

Messiah ran away from the field
to win the Invitational, Messiah fin-
ished with 26 points, Mary Wash-
ington 55 and W&L 62.

The Generals continue to gain on
regional power Mary Washington.
The Eagles, ranked 18th in the nation
and defending regional champs, did
not have a runner finish ahead of
either Hannah or Edwards.

The Generals plan on continuing
to ride this wave of improvement as
they host Shepperd and Roanoke in
this Saturday’s 12:00 tri-meet. This
contest pits them against an Old
Dominion Athletic Conference rival in
Roanoke, and thus should be a bar-
ometer for the team as they ready
themselves for a run at the ODAC
title.

Depth, defense lifts women’s

soccer in two to

 

By Sarah Gilbert
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee women’s
soccer team earned two key Old
Dominion Athletic Conference wins
last week to run its record to an
impressive 4-2, 4-1 in the ODAC.

On Tuesday at Randolph-Macon,
the Generals went down to the wire,
winning 1-0 in overtime on a goal by
senior Morgan Warner.

“It was a really tough win,’’ said
head coach Janine Hathorn, ‘‘Ran-
dolph-Macon is always a very physi-
cal and hard-played game.”’

Not only was Warner a star, but
the entire bench got Hathorn’s atten-
tion with its effort.

“The bench is what makes us
good. They are really solid, and they
always play really well,’’ said
Hathom. ‘‘Any of the substitutes
could be a starter on other teams.
We have a lot of depth and — one
more time — this is the reason why
we won our game,”’

Though the Generals faltered in
the first half of Saturday’s game at
Guilford, they held on in the second
period to shut out the Quakers, 2-0.

Sophomores Angie Carrington and
Corinda Hankins provided the game’s
only goals. Hankins chalked up the
first off a corner kick and a goalie
error, and Carrington was successful
in a breakaway for the second.

“It was a really good game,”’
said Hathorn. ‘‘It wasn’t a really
great first half, but we pretty much
dominated from the beginning of the
second half, and were by far the best
team.”

She felt this game was a turning
point for her team.

‘It was a very pivotal game for

Senior Morgan Warner, In action last year, scored the lone goal in

us. We were involved in a very close
game, and finally were able to win
in that situation,’’ she said.

‘*We exhibited a lot of poise and
patience. We really did our best job
so far this year of playing a con-
trolled game.”’

Along with Warner and soph-
omore Aspen Yawars, Hathorn was
again pleased with the non-starters.

‘The bench was critical. That we
have so many players that can main-
tain a certain level of play is really
nice,’’ she said.

Having shut out their past three
opponents, the Generals are in good

form to meet a tough Gettysburg
team Saturday at 3:00 p.m.

‘After a big win we've got to
find a way to buckle down and get
back to work. It was a close game
last year, and playing away can add
to the difficulty, so we have a tough
game on our hands,’ Hathorn said.

“‘T just can’t say enough about the
way my team plays together and the
way they work hard and play hard
every minute of the game.”’

Saturday’s game will be played at
Gettysburg.

hang on, but we never got it going
again.”’

On the day, McDaniel gained 100
yards for the third straight time
against W&L, but he earned them,
rushing 37 times for 110 yards.

Goglia led the W&L rushing at-
tack with 43 yards on nine carries,
and freshman Michael MacLane
added 41 yards on eight carries.

Defensively, junior Lyle Smith led
the way with 18 tackles. Seniors Trey
Cox and Scott Williamson had 14
each, and Dave Frankhouser had 13.

Next up for the Generals, 0-3, 0-
1 in the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference, is a trip to take on ODAC
rival Randolph-Macon.

Fallon says his Generals should
have their hands full.

“Offensively, they're never out of
a game because of their passing
game. They throw it all over the
place. They live by the pass, and
they can use it as a ball-control of-
fense. Defensively, it’s like playing
King Kong and his quadruple
brothers. They’re fast and strong and
they flock to the ball.’’

King Kong is former ODAC
Player of the Year Jody Kane, who
missed last year with a knee injury.

Despite the early struggles, Fallon
is optimistic.

“We haven’t given up yet, and
we're not going to,’’ he said. ‘‘May-
be we'll have one of those days
where it all clicks for us. -

‘Nothing can beat the feeling of
a little success coming your way.
We’re hungry and we're hoping for
our first win.’’

W&L drubs
everyone in
state meet

The Washington and Lee water
polo team ran away with the title in
Virginia State Championships this
past weekend at Twombly Pool, but
the Generals are keeping their success
in perspective.

Despite resounding victories over
rivals James Madison, Lynchburg,
Virginia Tech and Hampden-Sydney,
the team must now face the toughest
part of their schedule,

According to W&L head coach
Page Remillard, ‘‘We played a dif-
ferent caliber of teams this past
weekend than we had at the Eastern
Water Polo Association [tournament]
in Annapolis two weekends ago.’’

Though the Generals were heavily
favored to run away with the VSC
title, overconfidence did not detract
from their play on Saturday. The
Generals opened the tournament with
an impressive 14-5 victory over JMU
and followed with victories over
Lynchburg, 19-5, and Va. Tech 22-
3,

“Overall the VSC was a good
tuming point to get back on track
after the EWPA,”’ said junior Chris
Hagge.

After a slow start Sunday in the
championship game against H-SC,
W&L rallied to clinch a 14-4 victory.

Winning aside, Remillard felt that
the player’s mental preparedness was
somewhat lacking. ‘‘After a terrible
warmup and first half against Hamp-
den-Sydney, we loosened up in the
second half to pull away,’’ Remillard
said.

He added, however, that because
of the Generals’ sub-par first half
effort, bench action was limited in
the H-SC game. Senior All-Amer-
icans Alan Herrick and Will Davis
carried the brunt of the scoring
against H-SC with 3 goals and 4
goals, respectively.

On the defensive end, junior
goalie P.J. Waicus had 33 blocks for
the tournament while only allowing
15 goals. Herrick, Waicus, and senior
John Kannapell were voted to the all-
tournament team.

This weekend the Generals will
face the toughest test of the season at
the Southern Polo Conference Tour-
nament to be held in Lexington at
Twombly Pool.

On Friday evening, W&L will
play a crucial match against Dayton
at 8 p.m. followed by matches
against arch-rival Richmond on Satur-
day at 3:30 p.m. and Arkansas-Little
Rock on Sunday at 10:30 a.m.

Remillard said he looks forward
to the challenge of playing stiff com-
petition to see if the players can rise
to the occasion.

Washington and Lee soph-
omore Kate Stimeling came a long
way to go to school at W&L. But
Stimeling has made the most of
her home-away-from-home...away-
from-home.

If her Lexington residence is
her home-away-from-home, then
anchoring the defense as goalie on
the women’s soccer team is her
home-away-from-home-away-from-
home. And she doesn’t like much
company at her home on the field.

Just six games into her soph-
omore season, Stimeling has al-
ready tied the school record for
shutouts in a career with 12 and
has four shutouts already this year.

In six games, Stimeling has
allowed just three goals and regist-
ered 51 saves for a .944 save
percentage in helping lead the
Generals to a 4-2 start.

For her accomplishments,
Stimeling is The Ring-tum Phi
Athlete of the Month for Septem-
ber.

“I’m just focusing on having a
consistent game,’’ she said. ‘‘I’m
getting mentally prepared, and
focusing on making game winning
saves and keeping things to-
gether.”’

Perhaps her greatest ac-
complishment this year was keep-
ing things together in Tuesday’s 1-
0 win over Randolph-Macon. She
turned away 19 shots in the over-
time win.

‘We really came on in the
second half against Macon,’’ she
said of the team’s performance.
“Everyone played their best, and
the adrenaline was there. It was a
sweet win for everyone, but the
seniors especially.”’

Stimeling has been at her best
all season. She has allowed just
one goal in ODAC play, to Vir-
ginia Wesleyan and has not al-
lowed a goal in 340 minutes,
including 120 minutes in the over-
time win against R-MC. Against

Denison in the season opener,
Stimeling recorded 15 saves.

While she stands out in the
goal, Stimeling also can play in
the field, as she showed against
Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege. After shutting out R-MWC in
the first half, Stimeling played in
the field and scored a goal and
handed out an assist.

“T love playing with my feet
[in the field],’’ she said. ‘‘I miss
it a lot. I got out on the field and
I loved it — but I like playing
keeper too. That’s where I'll play
until we win an ODAC title.’’

That should be a relief to head
coach Jan Hathorn, who looked
long and hard, and far, to find the
goalie that just might bring Hath-
orn’s first Old Dominion Athletic
Conference crown to Lexington.

Men’s soccer boucnes |
back in rout of H-SC

 

By Sean O’Rourke
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer team was handed its first loss
of the season this past Saturday, and
the Generals weren’t too happy about
it.

National power Bethany College
beat W&L soundly 4-0. The Generals
came back with a vengeance on
Tuesday, though, dominating Old
Dominion Athletic Conference rival
Hampden-Sydney, 3-0.

With the win, W&L’s record
stands at 4-1-2, 2-0-0 in the ODAC.

Head coach Rolf Piranian looked
at the Bethany game in a positive
light. ‘‘No one got hurt,’’ he said.

Still though, he was clearly un-
happy with the loss. ‘‘The kids have
to get back to doing the things
they’re capable of doing. They
didn’t execute, so they just have to
do things better,’’ he said.

Senior tri-captain Jeff Zeiger said
he saw one positive aspect. ‘Bethany
is a good team and they exploited
our weaknesses. We know now what
we have to work on.”’

The Generals obviously worked on
the right things preparing for H-SC.
They dominated play from beginning
to end.

W&L’s first score came 40 min-
utes into the contest as junior Kyle
Fanning took a pass from classmate
Reid Murphy and deposited his shot
into the upper left corner.

Fanning struck again early in the
second half. He took a perfect pass
from freshman Eric Tracy and guided
it into an open goal for a 2-0 lead.

Later in the half, Tracy scored an
unassisted goal from 30 yards out for
the Generals’ final score of the after-
noon.

‘I thought we started off well,’’
said Murphy. ‘‘Usually we need a
few minutes to get into the game."’

Murphy also said that Saturday's
loss helped lead to Tuesday’s win. ‘‘I
think we learned from Saturday's loss
and just went out and played better

today.”

Piranian had a mixed review,
though. ‘‘We played well, but some-
thing was missing. There wasn’t
enough intensity and it wasn’t a very
emotional effort. I saw some im-
provement from Saturday, but Bet-
hany and Hampden-Sydney are two
totally different teams. So we'll have
to see,”’

The H-SC game marked the half-
way point in the regular season for
the Generals, and Piranian likes that
his team is still improving.

“I'd like to have our 11 best
players out there, but we’re still
playing better soccer. However,
there’s still a lot of room for im-
provement. I don’t believe this
team’s played its best soccer yet.'’

 

 

 

 

 

Mike Mitchem

The Generals are still without
junior Mike Mitchem (knee). He con-
tinues to be on a day-to-day basis.
The team might also be without
senior goalie Lee Corbin, who hurt
his foot in the first half of the
Hampden-Sydney game and was
forced to sit out the rest.

The Generals would like both of
these players for Saturday as the
Generals take on ODAC rival Roa-
noke at Liberty Field at 2 p.m.

On Tuesday, the Generals hit the
road for another tough ODAC chal-
lenge at Randolph-Macon, A win in
either of these games would match
the team’s win total of three against
ODAC opponents last year.

Senior gets one year suspended sentence, fine

 

By Cathy Lopiccolo
News Editor

 

A Washington and Lee senior was sentenced
Sept. 24 to a one year suspended prison sen-
tence, a $500 fine and 50 hours of community
service after he pled guilty to trespassing.

Marcus Lamar Miller was arrested Aug. 6
and charged with breaking into a female W&L
student’s home in Lexington and attempting to
rape or sexually assault her, police records
show.

According to court records, the original
charge of breaking and entering with intent to
commit a felony, rape, was reduced in exchange
for Miller’s pleading guilty to trespassing.

Lexington Police Sgt. E. W. Straub said the
Commonwealth's Attorney Eric Sisler explained
the plea bargain to the victim, who agreed to

the bargain and to Miller’s sentence.

As part of his sentence, Miller must undergo
counselling and is forbidden from contacting the
woman he was charged with attempting to
assault.

Senior Stephanie McHaney said the victim
was having a party with McHaney, Miller and
other friends the night of Aug. 5. Straub said
the victim drank too much and passed out.

McHaney said a female friend took the
victim to her room and put her in bed. McHan-
ey then decided to take home one of the guests
and go to Lee-Hi Truck Stop with another girl.

McHaney said she locked the back door and
all the windows in the house before they left,
because she thought Miller had been ‘‘acting
strange’ and might try to come back that night.

McHaney said as she and her friends drove
away, they noticed Miller was sitting on the
porch of a neighboring house.

McHaney said she dropped off one of the
girls at her home and then she and the remain-
ing girl went back to the victim’s house.

At the house, McHaney said she and her
friend noticed that the victim's bedroom light
was off, although they had tumed the light on
before they left.

McHaney said they also found one of the
doors partially opened, but still locked by a
security chain.

When the women went to check on the
victim, McHaney said they found the victim
partially undressed and Miller in the bedroom.
McHaney said the woman was still asleep and
evidently had not moved while her friends were
gone.

Miller told the women he had come back to
the house to pick up his backpack, which had
beer in it, McHaney said. McHaney said the
backpack was downstairs, not upstairs where

the victim’s bedroom is.

Straub said he found a window with a
broken blind and footprints on the window sill,
which indicated someone used the window to
enter the house.

After Miller left the house, McHaney said

Miller could not be reached for comment.

The student who police say Miller tried to

Graffiti
defaces
poster

A threatening racial slur was writ-
ten on a poster in the Washington
and Lee Law School last week.

A female first-year law student
found the words ‘‘Kill the Niggers’’
scrawled on a poster in her carrel in
the law library Thursday. The ‘‘Free
South Africa’ poster depicted a pic-
ture of a black man and woman.

No evidence suggests the graffiti
was written by a W&L law student,
said Randall Bezanson, dean of the
Law School.

“I don’t have any reason specifi-
cally to think it was a law student,”’
Bezanson said.

He said this is the second piece
of anti-black graffiti the woman has
found in her -carrel in about three
weeks. She did not report the first
slur because she believed it was an
isolated incident, Bezanson said.

The woman plans to respond to
the graffiti in a letter to the student
body of the Law School, said Reggie
Aggarwal, president of the first-year
law class.

Inmediately after learning of the
graffiti, Bezanson sent a letter to law
students and faculty denouncing the
slur as an ‘‘act of moral and intellec-
tual cowardice.

“‘T think there is unanimous revul-
sion and moral condemnation of this
act within the student body,’’ Bezan-
son said. ‘‘I haven’t spoken to any-
one who wasn’t saddened, upset and
...surprised this would happen here.”’

Minority Students Association
President Rita Poindexter said the
MSA will not respond.

‘‘We feel there’s no need to pay
any attention to such ignorance,”
Poindexter said.

Monday the Student Bar Associa-
tion condemned the graffiti.

W&L Security and the dean of
students are investigating the inci-
dent, Bezanson said.

The introductory chapters in the typical

and as the lessons progress, the litile draw-
ings of Julio's sombrero or escargots on a
plate become fewer and fewer. Soon, the
professor is plunging into subjunctives and
pluperfect verb tenses, plural possessives and
inversion, while the students are still flound-

what she needs.

‘I’ve considered different approaches
- like using magazines, board games such as
Scrabble and visual association games like
Pictionary — to get down to the basics in
which we can actually communicate,’’ Smith
said.

Smith, a Romance languages major from
Greensboro, N.C., said he has taken one year

Spanish will be essential in his sessions with

is what she’s been able to pick up waiting

In return for Smith’s help, Cedillo will

dedicates Renaissance

Fraternity Renaissance at W&L
began in October, 1985 with a day-
long symposium sponsored by the
Alumni Fraternity Council.

At the fall 1988 board meeting, the
trustees announced the approval of a
$10 million plan for the renovation
phase of Renaissance. Under the
program, the university advanced
financing for renovation of the frater-
nity houses. The money was to be
returned to the school over a period
of time through alumni gifts, rental
payments, and Greek membership
fees.

By 1987, standards for all the
fraternities had been published. To
be eligible for renovation, each
fraternity had to implement various
policies, such as for the responsible

use of alcohol and the prohibition of

illegal drugs in the houses, and to en-
courage academic excellence and
intellectual growth among its mem-
bers.

The university's goal is to bring all
fraternity houses into compliance with
the Alumni Fraternity Council-set
standards by September, 1993.

86 percent pledge

 

By Maureen Levey
Staff Reporter

 

Eighty-six percent of freshmen who rushed this year
pledged a fraternity, said Associate Dean of Students
for Greek Affairs Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins at
Tuesday night's Interfraternity Council meeting.

“I’m very pleased with these numbers,’
said.

IFC President Greg Hicks reminded fraternities that
pledgeship does not begin until January.

“I want to keep fall Rush, so there shouldn't be
clean-ups or sober driving asked of freshmen that’s not
asked of the brothers,’’ said Hicks.

With Homecoming this weekend, Atkins also
reminds the fraternities to try to contain the drinking.

‘It is critical to use alcohol responsibly. If you
can't, don’t use alcohol at all,’’ said Atkins.

‘‘When I was a student here, guys were looked
down on who fell and got sick all over,’’ said Atkins.
‘*It was cool to be able to hold your alcohol.”’

Atkins reminded the fraternities that for just one
night, it could be easy and effective to tone down
drinking and abide by chapter constitutions.

SAB bills total
$9.000 deficit

 

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

The Student Activities Board had a deficit
of almost $10,000 last year, which was $6,000
more than SAB members told the Executive
Committee at the end of the year.

SAB Treasurer Susan Wooton said that
$6,339.52 of the $9,663.15 overrun came from
Fancy Dress, which runs on a separate budget.
The other $3,323.63 was from the regular SAB
budget.

In May, then-FD Chairman John Flippen
told the EC that the event had gone about
$6,300 over budget due to stolen equipment, a
second printing run of invitations, fireworks,
and an unexpectantly high clean-up cost.

However, then-SAB Chairwoman Kathleen
Duwel said the SAB had a surplus of about
$3,000 which could be used to cover part of
the FD deficit, leaving the total overrun at only
$3,000.

Wooton said when she took over the job
this year, she was told there had been about a
$3,000 deficit. Later, she found out from W&L
Assistant Controller Don Holt, who is in charge
of student organization accounts, that the deficit
had been much higher.

Wooton said that in addition to the $6,000
FD. deficit, the SAB general budget was also

$3,000 over buget. She said she thinks the
deficit was due to a poor showing at the Ne-
ville Brothers concert in the spring.

Duwel told the EC in May that the Neville
Brothers had cost about $18,000. She said the
SAB made $3,000 from the event, half of what
was expected.

“The Neville Brothers were supposed to
come earlier in the year, but they couldn’t and
were scheduled for spring term,’’ Wooton said.
‘“That’s a pretty expensive band for that time
of the year’? when many students are away
from campus.

Wooton said the deficit is ‘‘not the prob-
lem’’ of this year’s SAB since all organization
deficits are covered at the end of the year.

EC President Giles Perkins explained that at
the end of the year, the surplus money from all
student organization accounts is collected into
‘fone big pot.’’ Unpaid bills from any or-
ganization are then paid.

Had the SAB not run up the deficit, Perkins
added, the $9,000 would have been part of the
EC surplus and could have been used during
this year’s budgeting process.

Criticizing the SAB’s overrun at Monday’s
EC meeting, first-year law Rep. Bill Callahan
said such deficits ‘‘invalidate the whole budget
process.”’

Perkins said the EC will watch the SAB
more closely this year.

Non-smokers petition

 

By Craig Burke
Assignment Editor

 

About 60 first-year law students signed a
petition calling for a ban on smoking in all in-
door, public areas on the campus of Washing-
ton and Lee, law student Steve Brody said.

Brody said he took over the campaign when
president of the first-year law class Reggie
Aggarwal met with resistance in his efforts to
bring about a change in the current university
smoking policy.

‘*Reggie needed somebody to take over the
organization of this petition,’’ Brody said. ‘‘He
will still be involved in representing the petition
in front of the Student Bar Association.”’

Brody said he believes it is the university's
responsibility to create a policy that would
protect the rights and health of non-smokers.

‘Smokers shouldn't have the right to harm
non-smokers when it has been medically proven
that secondhand smoke is dangerous,’’ he said.

He said the Co-op in particular needs to
change its current smoking policy, moving the
smoking area from the main room to the back
room.

“T eat lunch at the Co-op,’’ Brody said.
‘I’m almost always nearly asphyxiated and
never able to find a seat in the little non-smok-
ing area,”’

The smoking area in the Co-op is limited to
the section farthest from the grill, Food Service
worker Nancy Hofstetter said.

Hofstetter said she believes most students
stick to these rules and should be allowed to
smoke.

‘T think it’s everyone's option to do what
they want to do,’’ Hofstetter said. ‘‘It’s wrong
to tell somebody they can’t do something.”’

Brody said he’s collecting signatures from
members of the first-year law class, because
it’s a small, yet diverse group.

‘*A group this size is manageable,’’ he said.
‘‘With a larger group, it would be too difficult
to get correct percentages.’’

The petition will be presented to the SBA,
Brody said. The SBA would then probably
present the findings to the Executive Commit
tee,

‘“‘T don’t agree with a total ban on smok
ing,’’ Aggarwal said. ‘‘But there is obviously
some concern out there, and the university
should be aware of it.’’

SAB... again

Look out everybody, comedy and big-screen entertain-
ment are coming your way soon, courtesy the Student Ac-
tivities Board. And at the modest price tag of $5,500, it’s a
veritable steal.

Or so the Executive Committee must have believed when
they allocated $6,000 additional to SAB Monday, giving the
board a budget of about $5,500 more than they had last
year.

This new allocation came simultaneously with SAB’s
realization that last year’s board left almost $10,000 in
unpaid bills for the student body surplus and reserve to pick
up.

This scenario might sound familiar to those of you with
good long-term recall. Just two years ago the SAB made
September headlines with some $20,000 in unpaid bills
which flooded the business office over the summer. After a
year of hand-slapping by the EC, the committee reinvested
its trust in SAB. Alas, only to be disappointed again.

But this time the EC did not seem dismayed by disap-
pointment, as they threw more money into an organization
which has proven its inability to handle it. Undoubtedly
there is an argument at work that this year’s SAB cannot be
held acountable for last year’s SAB’s screw-ups. Well that
argument works nicely in Utopia where the slate is cleared
annually, but W&L is not Utopia. In our reality, somebody
has to pay the bills. The EC should have withheld exactly
the amount of last year’s deficit in this year’s allocation to
SAB, rather than spreading the deficit over all the student
organizations.

SAB is the only student organization that has this
peculiar immunity to doing wrong. The EC is quick to
recognize mishandled money in the most small-time of
allocatees, who promptly throw themselves at the commit-
tee’s mercy. As well they should. The EC is also quick to
condemn for surplus by withholding that much money the
following year, a fact of life candidates have promised and
failed to circumvent for ages. All in all, small student
organizations have to walk a dangerous tightrope between
surplus and deficit, while SAB puts on a happy face and
promises that more money equals more entertainment.

Well, EC President Perkins said himself that times are
tough. Especially given the financial needs of Mock Con-
vention, everyone else, even the EC in its own reserves, is
having to do more with less, whether their predecessors
screwed up or not. SAB should be no exception.

 

A traditional time

It seems almost cliche to say it, but Homecoming is one
of the most traditional times of year. While living in
Lexington and studying at Washington and Lee means being
aware of the past every day, Homecoming is a physical link
with a past not easily forgotten. As the pace of change here
on campus proceeds, this year’s freshmen will not graduate
from the ‘‘same’’ school they began this fall, just as this
year’s graduates marvel at the changes since 1988. This
weekend reminds us that we are only the latest in an im-
mense, continuous chain that began nearly 250 years ago.

More importantly, we must realize that change has been
going on for those entire 250 years, and before we listen to
the doomsayers decrying the end of Washington and Lee as
we know it, let’s realize that the university has survived
countless waves of change, not to mention a few wars in its
time. Welcome back alums; observe and recognize what has
changed, as well as what has remained the same.

If my journalistic instincts are correct, some young,
Jonny-come-lately, humor-writing upstart has replaced me
at the Phi and I am nothing more than a dim memory in
the drug-riddled minds of a few campus outcasts, such as
my old editor Chris Baradel, who now works in the
Alumni Office, and is still trying to figure out what I
mean when | say ‘‘journalistic instincts.’’ Whew! (The
Phi’s new humor writer may be good, but I'll bet he
can’t write a sixty-seven word opening sentence that says
absolutely nothing.)

Okay, kids. Please excuse the ravings of a Phi has-
been, but it’s the time of year when recent alumni
swagger into metro Lex with their lectures about the
cold, cruel world and attempt to make you feel guilty for
not enjoying every single second of your time at college.

I hate to fall into that same trap, but the real world
is cold and cruel and disappointing and boring, and why
don’t I just stop here and put a bullet through my head?
I'll tell you why. Because I’m looking forward to
swaggering into town on Homecoming to lecture you
students about how tough it is in the real world. Of
course, while the real world is cold and cruel, it’s also
filled with wild women who don’t care if people in the
Co-op talk about what they did over the weekend. So
maybe the real world isn’t that bad after all.

But all joking aside, I really have felt older since
graduating last spring. My back aches every morning.
When I listen to the radio, I can’t differentiate between
the songs and the commercials. My teeth are falling out.
Lately, even my Dad seems to be making sense. And
worst of all, I recently picked up an attractive woman
and was unable to sustain an...just kidding.

The actual truth is that college, with its exams,

research papers, and snarling professors, sucks compared
‘ to my real world. Naturally, I am unemployed and living
at home. I am ‘‘working on my book,”’ which is a rice
way of saying that I sleep until noon.
9 Actually, my life isn’t that care-free. I do do (fore-
shadowing pun) a little work around the house. Every
Sunday, for example, I walk around the backyard with a
large grocery bag and my trusty double-pronged scooping
implement and pick up the dog droppings that have
accumulated over the week — damn good thing I have
a liberal arts degree.

Homecoming queens and old alums

 

LET IT RIDE
By Chris Swann

 

I had planned to write a rather satiric article on
our Homecoming weekend, poking fun at all the
alcohol the returning alumni seem to consume and
how highly amused we are by their antics, but then
my dad called about the credit card bill. My dad
graduated from here in '63 and could very possibly
see any ridicule of alumni as something next to
secession from the South. So, | decided that maybe
I'd better tone it down since dad is making my
four-year college career possible. So, the following

Homecoming gala and in no way reflects on any
actual W&L alumni. Sure, and the Homecoming
queen will be from Southern Sem...

As the autumn days slide by, and our grades
slide down proportionately, we dust off our nice
outfits from Foxfield and get ready for that most
mythical of our social events, Homecoming
weekend. Since our home is college (we live here
eight months out of the year), Homecoming for us
doesn’t mean a return to a familiar place but
another reason to drink and be merry. But for the
hundreds of alumni that come back to campus,
Homecoming revives memories of ‘‘When / was at
W&L...’” as men in their fifties disinter their old
fraternity boy lives, once more hanging in the halls
of their long-lost social order, showing off for the
students and their wives (who most likely went to

Dean condemns
racist vandal

To all students:

I have just been informed that a poster
belonging to a student and located in the stu-
dent’s carrel, which read ‘‘Free South Africa’’
and pictured a black woman and a black man,
has been defaced by someone who wrote across
the top of the poster ‘‘Kill the Niggers.’’ I
hesitate to so baldly describe the defacement
because of its thoroughly vile nature, but it is
important that everyone in this law school com-
munity know and recognize the shocking nature
of the act. I do not now know the identity of the
person or persons who defaced the poster, and
who may have participated, perhaps with others,
in other instances of racist expression recently
directed at specific students. If anyone has any
information about the person or persons respon-
sible for these acts, I would like to be informed.

My purpose in writing immediately to all
students is to call upon the collective conscience
of this community to condemn in no uncertain
terms the repugnance of what has been done. The
defacement is an act of force, not of reason; an
act of hate or of hopeless ignorance, not of intel-
lect. It is, most importantly, an act of moral and
intellectual cowardice.

I would have thought that in this community
of talented and thoughtful people, no act of this
nature could occur; that respect for each of us as
individuals was indelibly imprinted in the values
and traditions of Washington and Lee. I am,
therefore, saddened and deeply disappointed. I am
also confident that all — or almost all — of us
are. This is not a time for rage, rage would be to
respond in kind and thereby to validate an
unforgivable act of intellectual and moral cowar-

The Homecoming football game is the one
golden opportunity for the Generals to shine,
mostly because no one shows up for the games
anyway. But at Homecoming, if you mention
“tailgate party’’, football fans are born overnight
and suddenly descend on the playing field like
locusts. There’s something almost ritual about
sneaking a flask into the stadium and joining your
friends in a screaming diatribe against the opposing
team. You are joined to a thousand other souls,
smelling of bourbon and fried chicken and

EC erred in
not funding ACLU

To the Editor:

Due to the eagerness which W&L publica-
tions display for labeling people as liberal or,
even worse, Politically Correct, I begin this letter
with a disclaimer: I am not a member of the
ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union), and I
strongly disagree with almost everything it does.
However, the reasons for which the W&L chap-
ter was denied funding are weak and border on
hypocritical.

Executive Committee Member Jay Sterne is
quoted as saying that ‘‘only the Speak-Outs
really benefit the campus,’’ suggesting that the
various proposed speakers for the ACLU are not
worthy of funding. Yet, he later defends Amnes-
ty International because of its ability to build
awareness of ‘‘things outside Rockbridge Coun-
ty.’’ I don’t think that anyone would disagree
with the statement that speakers brought here by
the ACLU would present ideas very different
from the majority of things heard in Rockbridge
County. Anyone who attended Molly Irvins’
speech could testify that she presented a fresh
viewpoint and demonstrated an impressive aware-
ness of state and national politics.

The point of all this is to show that the EC
needs to look more closely at what they consider
worthwhile for this campus, and that the student

choice, tight-fitting clothes (just kidding, ladies).
The rivalry between various girls’ schools is
amusing to watch; just look at the sneers Hollins
girls carry for a female from Sweet Briar. After
all, the only reason the guys walk out with their
dates is to prevent them from physically assaulting
the other girls. Women can be so vicious.

The alumni, however, provide the real
entertainment. You hear snatches of old fraternity
songs; cheers you never bothered to learn being
shouted by guys old enough to be your grandfather
whom you know damn well didn’t memorize the
stupid things when they were in school...

The funny thing is, we love seeing these people
because they love seeing us. OK, maybe Sunday
morning after, to your profound embarrassment,
your Uncle Larry from the class of '66 drank a
fifth of Scotch and proceeded to dance like they
did twenty-five years ago, you want to disown
him, but he’s still family. Remember, these people
were just like you once. Maybe a different haircut,
maybe the social buzzwords were ‘‘cool’’ and
**groovy’’ instead of ‘‘key’’ and ‘‘sweet’’, but they
attended classes (sometimes with the same
professor, what a horrible thought), slept in the
library, agonized over exams, danced on the gym
floor at Fancy Dress, drove to Goshen in the
spring, went rope-swinging and skeet-shooting out
in the country, went ‘‘down the road,’’ and, yes,
probably went to Lee-Hi truck stop at 2 a.m. some
weekends. What goes around, comes around.

So, have fun, relax, enjoy visiting with alumni,
drink and be merry, for Monday we will all be
hungover.

In praise of
administrators

To the Editor:

A few weeks ago we filed a complaint with
the president’s office and the Dean of Residence
Life. We were incredibly impressed with the
prompt, sincere attention that our problem was
given. Assistant to the President Thomas Litzen-
burg spoke with us that same day. Within 30
hours of filing this complaint, we were sent a
letter of apology from the president’s office and
had received a personal call from Dennis Man-
ning, assistant dean of students for residence life.
Later that week we met with Dean Manning,
further explaining our problem. Less than one
business day after our meeting, the problem was
entirely rectified.

The administration of this university has often
been the recipient of bad publicity; we feel they
do not deserve such negative comments. We
believe the administrators, like Thomas Litzen-
burg and Dennis Manning, are why Washington
and Lee is one of the nation’s best liberal arts
colleges. As long as W&L possesses a caring and
attentive faculty, we will remain a high quality
university.

EC allocates $18,000 to MC

 

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee completed its budget
Process on Monday by allocating funds for Mock
Convention and adding to the previous allocations
for Contact and the Student Activities Board.

MC received $18,000, which is $2,000 less than
its $20,000 funding request. EC President Giles
Perkins said the cut will probably not harm MC
much since the 1988 MC ended with a budget
surplus of $10,000.

EC members added $6,000 to the $49,500
already allocated for SAB. The organization came
in with a request for $62,945, which is $13,000
more than it received last year.

The reason for the increase was the SAB’s
plans to begin a movie and comedian series this
year.

SAB Treasurer Susan Wooton said, in order to

cope with the cut, the group would probably
decrease the number of events instead of
eliminating any entire series.

‘‘We may have a few less Pit bands or one
less comedian,’ Wooton said, ‘‘but we really
would like to have some variety this year with the
movies and comedians.’’

Special Events Chairman John Flippen said the
SAB will now go ahead with its plans to book a
“‘big name comedian,’ an event Flippen said
would have been ‘‘the first thing to go’’ if the
budget cut had been more significant.

Contact also received additional funding. The
EC added $3,000 to its previous allocation of
$22,000. The $25,000 total brings the group closer
to its original request of $26,950.

Perkins said Contact members had approached
him about adding funds so the group can sponsor
another speaker during the year.

Also included in this year’s budget are

reer Development and Placement
meeting held at Lee Chapel three
waks ago.

The suprisingly low attendance at
this meeting presents a drastic con-
trast from the attendance at last
year’s meeting, which had 297
seniors present.

Rick Heatley, assistant dean of
students and the director of Career
Services, was upset by the low tur-
nout. He said that the economy was
so bad last year and job placement
was so scarce, that many students in
this year’s senior class have been
scared to face the employment issue.

He also said that ‘‘the pattern is
turning around and this year promises
to be better.’” Already 37 companies
have contacted him about interview-
ing Washington and Lee students for
employment positions. In the past,
Heatley said that no more than 28

used by the EC for honor related costs.

Monday night’s allocations were added to the
total EC budget and the entire package approved.
The budget must be approved once more on
Monday before becoming official.

The additional allocations were made out of
funds from last year’s student body reserve surplus
of $14,150 and $5,258 was taken from the
Publications Board reserve of $9,258.

In other business, the EC announced it will be
taking applications this week for appointed
positions. Interviews will be held Monday.
Information on what positions are available will be
posted around campus or can be obtained by
contacting EC Secretary Caroline Wight.

Also, the EC will hear student opinions about
the proposed location of the addition to the Reeves
Center at Monday’s regular meeting. Perkins said
an EC opinion on the proposal might be given to

Molly Ivins, political humorist and
columnist for the Dallas Times
Herald, spoke Oct. 3 in Lee Chapel
to commemorate the bicentennial of
the Bill of Rights.

Her speech, entitled ‘‘Freedom
Fighters In Our Time,’’ was a discus-
sion on her opinions of today’s politi-
cal status based on her experience as
a journalist over the past 20 years.

of the U.S. government were of
substantial dissatisfaction.

‘*The Declaration of Independence
is a heritage of enormous value that
is going down the tubes,’’ Ivins said.

She also expressed her disgust for
low voter turnout and some U.S.
leaders.

The United States ‘‘has had two
presidents in the past 20 years, Ri-
chard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, who
have treated the Constitution like a
box of kitty litter,’’ Ivins said.

Ivins said she believes the U.S.
government should be in a state of

‘‘perpetual reform,’’ where things are
constantly being changed and fixed.
‘‘Government is not a problem
or a solution. Government is a tool
like a hammer that can be used to
build or to destroy,’’ Ivins said.

In a_ follow-up question and
answer session Ivins voiced opinions
on prominent political figures.

When asked if she considered
President Bush to be a true Texan,
Ivins responded, ‘‘Real Texans don’t
wear blue slacks with little green
whales on them or describe trouble as
deep doo-doo.”’

D’Souza speaks

 

By LaKeisha Townes
Staff Reporter

 

‘In my book, I describe a silent
revolution that is occuring on Ameri-
can [college] campuses. There are
several names for this revolu-
tion...pluralism, multiculturalism,
diversity,’’ said Dinesh D'Souza,
author of the controversial book,
Illiberal Education: The Politics of
Sex and Race on Campus.

D’Souza spoke to Washington and
Lee students in Lee Chapel Tuesday
night. His lecture focused on his
book and public reaction to it.

D’Souza began by speaking about
what he called ‘‘a kind of new cul-
tural imperialism,’’ and ‘‘proportional
representation’ on college campuses.

D’Souza researched six institu-
tions: University of California at
Berkeley, Stanford University, Har-
vard University, Howard University,
Duke University, and the University
of Michigan.

During his study, D’Souza said
that he found admissions policies that
were preferential to minorities and
women, which he said might ‘‘mis-
place’ individuals in a curriculum
which may be too advanced.

While D’Souza agreed that there
are many valid arguments for affirma-
tive action, he said that this policy is
causing a ‘‘new segregation,’’ and is

creating even more racial tension.

This hurts those being given pref-
erential treatment, D’Souza said,
because they may be unable to com-
pete with other students, and will end
up feeling inferior.

D’Souza admitted that these prob-
lems can’t be solved overnight, but
said that ‘‘continual ignorance’’ of
the problems won’t make them go
away.

Hull’s continues the tradition

 

By Randy Devere
Staff Reporter

 

The local Drive-in. Moonlit summer
nights. Children playing on the grassy hill-
side, Teenage couples tucked away in the
back seat of a car. Families lounging in the
back of a flat-bed truck. Double features.
Popcorn for 80 cents; hamburgers for $1.40.

A scene straight out of ‘“‘Happy Days?’’
Perhaps, but in these days of the multi-
screen Enormoplex, a family-operated, neig-
hborhood drive-in still thrives. And it’s right
on Route 11 in Lexington.

Hull’s Drive-In, owned and operated by
Sebert and Effie Hull of Lexington, has
been a local landmark for over 40 years.
Bought in 1957 by Mr. Hull, the Drive-In is
now one of only two such establishments in
southwestern Virginia.

Hull’s closest competitor is the Starlite in
Christiansburg. In the state, scarcely two
dozen drive-ins continue to cater to those
who like some fresh air with their Cokes
and JuJu Bees.

Hull grew up on drive-ins, and worked

at one during his teenage-years. His love for
the business took him to Buena Vista, where
he helped run a theater for seven years.

Then, one night in 1957, Hull accom-
panied a friend to the old Lee-Hi Drive-In.
‘I don’t even remember how we got in,”
says Hull. ‘‘After we watched the movie for
about 20 minutes, my friend asked me if I
wanted to buy the Drive-In. It sounded like
a good idea, and 5 weeks later, I was runn-
ing the place.”’

Every kind of movie imaginable has
flashed across the big screen that backs up
to Route 11, from B-movie horror and
spaghetti westerns, to current features **Point
Break’’ and ‘‘Only The Lonely.’’ However,
it hasn’t always been easy. The drive-in
used to show movies all week, but has now
gone to a Friday-Saturday-Sunday schedule.
The Hulls even tried to run the theater year
round, but found that customers didn’t enjoy
snowstorms as much as warm breezes. They
now operate from March to November.

The Hull’s have watched the culture
change and generations pass, factors that
often turn drive-ins into nothing but wisps
of nostalgia.

blow to the drive-in business," says Hull.
"But the thing that hurt us the most was
probably day-light savings time."

Despite those unavoidable problems, the
Hull’s have only once in 35 years been
forced to cancel a show.

‘One time during the seventies a transfor-
mewr in the projector blew,’’ explains Hull.
‘We didn’t have an extra, so we had to
send everyone home.”’

Hull’s has proven so durable that even a
bolt of lightening couldn't prevent the show
from going on. ‘‘One night in the early
sixties, during a thunder storm, lightning hit
the screen and left a hole about 12 feet
wide,”’ Hull recalls with a laugh. ‘‘We still
finished the movie, though.”’

Hull said that business has been on the
upswing this year. The low prices ($3 for
adults, $1 for children) often attract as many
as 200 people a night.

Aside from the low prices, Hull remains
somewhat at a loss to describe the con-
tinuing appeal of the drive-in.

“I guess people like to be outside,’’ |
Hull says. ‘‘They like to be able to eat what
they want, smoke, and sit on the grass. I
guess that just doesn’t change.’’

 

Hull makes repairs around the drive-in he and his wife own.

The Ring-tum Phi, October 10, 1991

Cancer is a word we forget all
too often today.

I find it difficult to think about
myself, because my grandmother died
at a relatively young age, of cancer.

We all speak of her fondly, espe-
cially at holidays. For my own mot-
her, it is even harder because she
thinks of her mother each day.

We all wish she had more time.
All those years she deserved to live.

It is sad that so many of us have
a grandmother, uncle, or even a
member of our immediately family
who has cancer. Even here on the
campus, there are people we see
every day who have or had cancer.

Anne Zeigler, secretary to Dean
Peppers, suffered from malignant
melanoma 17 years ago.

She went to the doctor to have a
lump removed in her breast.

As an afterthought, she asked the
doctor to take out a three-year-old
black mole on the back of her left
leg.

The doctor ran a biopsy on both
areas. The lump was merely a cyst,
and ironically, the mole was malig-
nant.

“The Lord works in mysterious
ways,’’ Anne said.

The doctor also said that her leg
needed surgery to check the extent of
the cancer. He wasn’t sure if she

would have to lose her leg.

“‘The next two days after. the
news were the hardest. I left the
doctor’s office and the first thing I
did was take a drive. I drove to a
mountain in Buena Vista. I cried
and cried and cried,’’ Anne said.

After the initial shock, Anne

“‘The most important thing is to
get checked by the doctor regularly,’’
said Anne.

realized there wasn’t much she could
do. She would have to face the si-
tuation.

Fortunately, the doctors removed
her cancer without many problems,
but since the cancer had spread, she
was in bed for a month after surgery.

After that time Anne was able to
visit her doctor’s office. He said that
Anne would have to learn to walk all
over again.

“I hopped off the doctor’s table
and fell flat on my face,’’ Anne said
with a chuckle. She knew it would
take awhile.

After learning to use a walker,
and doing much therapy, Anne was
back to work in under four months.

Anne came out from her battle
with cancer. There are survivors like
her with determination and luck.

The doctor asks many of them,
who sent you?

And he knows it was Anne.

There’s nothing wrong with going
to a physician regularly. It is also
important to know that some people
aren’t as lucky as Anne.

There are ways to help and it is
SO easy.

A perfect opportunity for you
could be this Sunday:

On Oct. 13, the third annual Mak-
ing Strides event for the Rockbridge
Community Unit of the American
Cancer Society will take place at 1:30
pm.

Beginning at the Harris Teeter
parking lot on West Nelson Street,
cancer patients, family members,
friends, and the public will obtain
sponsors to walk, run, bike and even

roller blade across a set course.

This event combines a hopeful
mesage that cancer can be beaten
with a fun oppotunity to raise money
for the society’s programs of
research, education and patient ser-
vices.

Honorary Co-Chairmen are E.G.
‘*Buck”’ Leslie of W&L’s Athletic
Department, recovering from chronic
leukemia and recent spleen surgery,
and George Cunningham, still running
marathons despite the removal of his
larynx years ago.

Registration begins at 12:30 pm,
and will cost five dollars.

Pledge sheets are available at the
Co-op. The course is approximately
five miles, and winds from Harris
Teeter, through Lexington to VMI
Island, up the Chessie Trail, by Dore-
mus Gym and up Washington Street
back to Harris Teeter.

The are many prizes for the event
donated by local merchants as well as
the Grand Prize of a Romance Week-
end at the Massanutten
Resort west of Harrisonburg for the
participant raising the most money.

It sounds like fun and it will be.
Homecoming activities , will
be over, and this ‘‘Move-Along-A-
Thon’’ can be a success. I urge you
to participate because cancer patients
need your support.

Sef? Reporter

 

Alasdair McGowan, a 20-year-old Oxford
graduate, is here at Washington and Lee as part of
an exchange program. His most embarrassing
moment occured just a short time after he arrived
in Lexington.

‘“‘The second night here, I needed a
screwdriver to fix the plug in my stereo. I knocked
on [my roommate’s] door hoping that he’d have a
screwdriver and basically he was stark naked
standing behind the door with his girlfriend.’’

McGowan has found W&L to a be an interest-
ing, if sometimes strange, place to attend school.

He said that here there is more of an emphasis
on the social aspect of college, which he believes
is an ‘‘equally valid reason’ for going to a univer-
sity.

The differences between Oxford and W&L are
many. ‘‘Here you have a class-based system. In
Oxford the emphasis is upon a tutorial system.
You'll talk to the teacher with one or two other

  

students and you'll give him your essay and he
tells you what he thinks. You more or less teach
yourself at Oxford,’’he said.

McGowan enjoys America for several reasons,
but best of all are the women. ‘‘The girls are
absolutely gorgeous. They’re all so generally blon-
de and beautifully tanned and looking incredibly
fit. It’s very flattering for the men,’’ he said.

McGowan finds that the main difference bet-
ween the United States and Scotland are the
number of choices. ‘*You go to a grocery store
and you get 50 different brands of cereal. You get
like 5 or 10 at home. And cable TV is fantastic.
We have four stations. I love MTV.’’

He believes the traditions at W&L are interest-
ing. ‘‘The Honor System engenders a feeling of
mutual trust and you can generally be more relaxed
and a greater sense of community is fostered as a
result,’’ he said.

“I’m very stuck by the amount of tradition that
is here. There seems to be a tradition for every
social activity. Like when you go to a football
game and you wear a shirt and tie, that’s
ridiculous,’’McGowan said.”

‘*You should always make a conscious choice
to follow the tradition and not follow it blindly so
that tradition doesn’t become just a means to
conformity,’’he said.

McGowan also said that. ‘‘There’s a real
tendency towards conformity here. There’s not as
much individuality compared to home,’’he said.
He said Americans all tend to dress, talk, and act
the same.

He has noticed that Robert E. Lee is ‘‘getting
very close to being almost a deity.

‘‘He does serve as a role model and Lee’s
example and the way he led his life and the values
he held seem to run straight through the university.
It gives you some benchmark by which to set your
performance here.”’

Now that Rush is over he commented that ‘‘it
seems to me there is too much pressure put on
people here to join a fraternity and to become part
of this general male bonding experience.

‘*It seems they are more drinking buddies rather
than soulmates,’’ he said.

McGowan plans to go into politics in Scotland

Polo mentally

tough in

By Andrew Fox
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Washington and Lee water
polo team entered the Southem Con-
ference Tournament this past weekend
at Twombly Pool determined to im-
prove on its 5-3 record.

Though the Generals lost two of
their four matches, the team showed
extraordinary mental awareness in
each match.

‘The team has a very good men-
tal makeup which greatly pleases me
at this point in the season,’’ said
head coach Page Remillard. ‘‘Due to
this, we feel we will be considered a
very dangerous opponent by other
teams down the road.”’

The improved mental performance
by the Generals was apparent in wins
over Dayton, 7-4, and Hampden-Syd-
ney, 15-2. The Generals’ defense
combined for 25 steals while allowing
only 6 goals.

Much of the defensive success can
be attributed to sophomore goalie P.J.
Waicus, who had 20 blocks, and
senior All-American Alan Herrick
who had 10 steals.

Both Herrick and senior Will
Davis carried the offensive load. Both
scored eight goals apiece for the tour-
nament.

‘For going 2-2,’’ said Davis. ‘‘we
appear to be playing with poise and
confidence.’’

Remillard said the teams’ im-
proved play was a direct result of the
leadership put forth by the senior

tourney

players so far this season.

‘‘The leadership from the senior
class is excellent,’’ he said. ‘‘I hope
it will stay with the younger players
after they graduate.’’

The experience of veteran players
Herrick, Davis, Stu Towns, and John
Kannapell proved invaluable in the
Generals’ win over rival Dayton and
their hard fought loss to Arkansas-
Little Rock.

Against Dayton, W&L relied on
three goals from Herrick and two
from Kannapell to outscore their op-
ponent 5-0 in the final period to
ensure the win..

Offensive production continued
against UA-LR. W&L jumped out to
a 7-1 lead in the first half.

‘‘We caught a sleeping giant that
awoke in the fourth quarter,’’ said
Remillard.

Indeed the Trojans rallied to out-
score W&L 5-0 in the final period to
secure the comeback victory, includ-
ing the game-winner in the final 10
seconds.

Despite the setback, Remillard felt
the team played good, clean, and
aggressive polo.

Next week, the Generals travel to
Providence, Rhode Island to compete
in the EWPA Northern Tournament.

Unfortunately, the W&L Fall
Classic, which was to be held the
following weekend at Twombly Pool,
has been canceled due to withd-
rawals by Navy and Johns Hopkins.

Remillard said he hopes to
schedule a one game contest with
another Virginia team to fill the gap.

Volleyball struggles in ODAC play +) wo lead

 

By Rob Robinson
Staff Reporter

 

After winning two of three games
in the Maryville College Tournament
two weekends ago, the Washington
and Lee volleyball team struggled
against several Old Dominion Athletic
Conference opponents.

Guilford topped W&L in three
straight games to even the Generals’
ODAC record at 1-1. Senior Mena
McGowin led the W&L effort with
six kills. Freshman Michele Ralston
handed out 21 assists, and junior
Leslie Hess had eight digs.

‘‘We started well but fell apart,”’
said head coach Susan Dittman. ‘‘We
had several dumb errors on serve. We
basically didn’t show up.’’

The poor outing quelled the

momentum of a strong showing at
Maryville.
“The Generals won their tourna-
ment opener by beating Ashbury 15-
13 and 15-6. After the win, Maryville
proved to be a rude host, topping the
Generals 15-6, 15-7. W&L regrouped
to earn a tough win over Oglethorpe
15-12, 10-15, 15-11.

McGowin registered 20 kills for
the tournament, and Ralston added 45
assists in the three matches. Hess
finished with 18 kills, including a
team-high 14 against Oglethorpe, and
added 21 digs. Sophomore Tara
Burns added 11 kills and 20 digs for
the tournament.

‘‘Maryville was our first tourney
in the South,’’ Dittman said. ‘‘I felt
we made a good showing. We had

After a disappointing loss at Get-
tysburg Saturday, the Washington and
Lee women’s soccer team is looking
ahead to today’s game at Roanoke.

Senior Katie Seeman and soph-
omore Angie Carrington each scored
a goal to give the Generals a 2-1
first half lead, but they were held
scoreless in the second half and lost
3-2,

‘We played a team on Saturday
that was out to upset us, and they
ended up doing it,’’ said head coach
Janine Hathorm,

Though she felt that several play-

SERVIGTAR.

ers did not play their best, she said
that Seeman and sophomore Aspen
Yawars played well. ‘‘They both
stood out in my mind as having a
good game,’’ she said.

Hathorn says her team wasn’t
quite ready to play against Gettys-
burg. ‘I think we weren't ready,”’
she said. ‘‘The players just didn’t
realize that this non-conference game
was very critical to us.

‘We just had a bad day Saturday.
It’s a hard way to learn a lesson
sometimes. It’s just one of those
games that sort of gets you,’’ she
said.

Roanoke, a long-time W&L rival,
is the next opponent today at 4 p.m.

men past

The Washington and Lee men’s
cross country team, paced by junior
Bo Hannah, took top honors in Satur-
day’s first home meet of the year that
began with an extra competitor.

While W&L expected to run
against Roanoke and Shepherd, Eas-
tem Mennonite showed up unexpec-
tedly. W&L was quick to oblige all
three teams, running to a 20-40 win
over the competition.

Hannah established himself as
W&L’s top runner, leading the team
with his third straight week. Hannah
ran the course in 27:53 and was
alone as he crossed the finish line.

Teammate Charles Edwards was
next. The senior finished second
overall with a time of 28:34. W&L’s
one-two punch finished more than 31
seconds before the rest of the field as
the Generals won easily. Roanoke and
Shepherd did not have a runner in
the top sixteen.

Keith Rinn was the third finisher
for the team as he was fourth overall
with a time of 29:24. The W&L top
five also included David Phillips with
30:20, and Lee Parker at 30:33.

Head coach John Tucker continues
to see improvement in the team as
they prepare for their toughest com-
petition to date. Saturday’s meet at
Catholic will also feature Lynchburg,
the defending Old Dominion Athletic
Conference champions.

W&L will hope to show its depth
and send a message to Lynchburg
that a repeat in 1991 is not a given.

Herring, Generals
break in new course

 

By Jacob Kimball
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
cross country team finished ahead of
three other teams Saturday in the first
meet run on the newly re-designed
home course.

Eastern Mennonite was the overall
winner. The overall scores were EMC
19, W&L 48, Roanoke College 62,
and both Lynchburg and Shepherd
did not have complete team scores.
EMC was a surprise competitor, and
tumed out to be the class of the
field, although W&L picked up three
wins on the day.

The Generals top finisher was
Kim Herring, whose time of 22:06

was the second fastest recorded by a
General on a home course and good
enough for fifth overall. Nicole
Casteel also turned in a strong perfor-
mance, placing tenth overall and
second on the team with a time of
Zit,

Sue Duetsch was close behind in
24:26 and 12th overall. The top five
was rounded out by Teresa Lamey
and Brandi Henderson who fininshed
close together at 25:02 and 25:10,
respectively.

Feeling the effects of hard training
in the past few weeks, the Generals
welcome the chance for a breather.
W&L will not be in action on Home-
coming weekend. The Generals will
next run in the Virginia State Meet in
Williamsburg on October 19.

Men’s soccer fights
through two 1-0 losses

 

By Sean O’Rourke
Staff Reporter

 

Before their games with Roanoke
College and Randolph-Macon, the
Washington and Lee men’s soccer
team was poised to make a serious
run at the regular season Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference title.

But, after two heart-breaking 1-0
losses, the Generals are fighting for
team unity.

According to head coach Rolf
Piranian and a number of players,
there has been a lot of talking during
practices and games. Players are
getting on each other and it’s show-
ing on the field.

“*I considered last week a total
waste,’’ Piranian said. ‘‘I wasn’t hap-
py with the practices or with the
players’ attitudes, There was a lot of
talking and the Roanoke loss was the
result.”’

Junior Greg Williams saw things
the same way.

“Our problems aren’t physical.
There was a lot of griping during the
game. There's a lack of friendship on
this team, and there’s no respect
between players.”

However, the lack of unity had
nothing to do with the team’s offen-
sive drought. In both losses, the
offense had plenty of scoring chan-
ces, but they just couldn’t come
through with a score.

“It’s still a combination of mental

and technical problems,’’ said Pir-
anian. ‘‘We have the talent, we just
have to work it out.”’

But mental breakdowns aren’t an,
exclusive problem for the offense, the /
defense has been encountering short
lapses of concentration that have
resulted in opponents’ goals.

In both the Roanoke and Ran-
dolph-Macon games, the only goal
scored in each game was because of
a lapse in defensive play.

‘‘We dominated the first half,’’
said junior Winthrop Allen of the
Randolph-Macon game. ‘‘But with
five minutes to go in the half we
gave up a cheap goal because we lost
our concentration. Then in the sec-
ond half I think we just panicked and
went for too much too soon.”’

Piranian, despite the frustrating
losses, hasn’t given up.

“‘We still have what it takes to
win,’’ he said. ‘‘Now we just have to
put it all together and play better
soccer that we’ve been playing.”’

After a 3-0-2 start, W&L’s record
now stands at 4-3-2, 2-2-0 in ODAC
play. For the Generals to host a first
round game in the tournament they
must win their last two ODAC games

against Eastern Mennonite and
Lynchburg.
But up first is a tough Greensboro

team on Saturday at 12 p.m. at Liber-
ty Field, followed by a Wednesday
game against Eastern Mennonite, also
at home.

R-MC blanks W&L 27-0

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

The Washington and Lee football
team continues to have a rough time
of it in 1991.

W&L fell to Randolph-Macon 27-
0 on the road last Saturday to fall to
0-4 on the season and 0-2 in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference.

Randolph-Macon scored in the
game’s first minute to take control
early. Kerrell Bryant ran 46 yards to
the W&L three-yard line and scored
on the next play for a 7-0 Yellow
Jackets lead. Bryant ran for 107 yards
to lead the R-MC attack, which am-
massed 331 yards on the ground.

Steve Dodd had an 18-yard touch-
down catch and the Yellow Jackets
got a break when they recovered a
blocked punt in the end zone for a
third touchdown.

W&L caught one bad break on
the day and lost more than the game.
Senior linebacker Trey Cox broke a
bone in his foot and will miss at
least four weeks. Another injured

General, junior Sean Gatewood, is
expected to retum to action after
missing two games with a knee in-
jury.
The Generals did get a strong
defensive effort despite surrendering
27 points. Junior Lyle Smith led the
way with a career-high 27 tackles.
Sophomore linebacker Grant Rea,
who replaced Cox, also had a career-
high with 15 tackles. Senior John
McCallum added 14, including a
quarterback sack.

Junior punter Bob Ehret also had
a strong, but busy, afternoon. Ehret
punted 10 times for a 42.9-yard aver-
age, including a season-high 60 yard
effort.

W&L will look to rebound from
the tough loss this weekend against
Davidson College. The Wildcats are
1-3 on the season.

The game is the annual Home-
coming Game and will kickoff at 2
p.m. on Wilson Field. W&L has won
its last two Homecoming games and
is 19-15-2 in Homecoming games
since 1955.

Squeeze, Skins to start off

Homecoming

By Jason Kelley
Editor

 

 

For the second year in a row, Washington
and Lee’s Student Activities Board has been
able to book a nationally-known band for
homecoming.

This year, the English band Squeeze will
headline the Friday night concert at the Pav-
ilion. Last year, The Smithereens played for
homecoming.

‘Tt was really a coup to get Squeeze to
play here,’’ Dabney Collier, who is in charge
of booking bands for the SAB. ‘‘It’s really dif-
ficult to get nationally known bands to play at
small colleges.”’

Collier said
Squeeze will be
playing tonight in
Washington D.C.
where tickets will
be $24. Tomor-
row at W&L, the
SAB willonly be
charging $8.

Tomorrow’s
concert will be
only the second
time Squeeze has
played with its
new opening
band, The Candy Skins. According to Collier,
the members of the original opening band lost
their U.S. visas and had to return to Great
Britain.

Formed in South East London in 1974,
Squeeze was originally named U.K. Squeeze to
distinguish it from the disbanded American
Squeeze. The band broke up in 1982, but three
years later three of the original five members
of the band, Chris Difford, Gilson Lavis and

   

The Candy Skins

 

 

Weekend

Glenn Tilbrook, were joined by Keith Wil-
kinson to form the present Squeeze.

The band’s first hit ‘‘Take Me I’m
Yours,’’ came off their second album in 1978.
The cut was a top 20 hit in the U.K. that year.

Other early hits from the band include
‘*Up the Junction,” ‘‘Cool for Cats.’ Th
1981 they opened a series of concerts for Elvis
Costello’s U.S. tour. He in tum produced the
group’s fourth album, East Side Story, which
included their hits ‘‘Pulling Mussels from a
Shell’’ and ‘‘Tempted’’.

Later hits from the band include ‘‘La-
belled with Love,”’ ‘‘853-5937,’’ ‘‘Hourglass”’
and ‘‘Satisfied’’.

A compilation of their hits, Singles —
45’s and Under
reached number 3
on the English
charts in 1983.

Friday’s
opening _ band,
The Candy Skins,
released _ their
debut album,
Space I'm In, this
year in the U.K.
and the U.S.

Also from
Great Britain, the
band describes its
sound as ‘‘so-
mewhere between the lyricism of the Sixties
and the aggression of punk.”’

The Candy Skins songs display influences
ranging from Bob Dylan to the Sex Pistols to
the Beatles and the Byrds.

After W&L, Squeeze and The Candy
Skins will continue their U.S. tour in Philadel-
phia, Oswego, N.Y., Baltimore, New York
City, and 17 other cities. The tour will con-
clude in mid-November in Dallas.

Old football
rivalry up
for renewal

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

 

For the the first time in almost fifteen
years, Washington and Lee will carry its fierce
classroom rivalry with North Carolina’s David-
son College to the football field.

The two teams will collide Saturday at 2
p.m. on Wilson Field for the annual Homecom-
ing game.

While both colleges are strong academic
institutions which often compete for the same
students, this weekend's battle will call for the
clash of bodies and football pads, rather than
minds.

‘‘We put Davidson on the football sched-
ule because of the similarities between the
schools,’’ said W&L Athletic Director Mike
Walsh.

“TI know that both schools’ admission’s
offices cross-recruit,’’ he said, adding that the
two school’s traditionally attract top notch
students who are also quality athletes.

In a recent US News & World Reports
poll, Davidson and W&L were ranked together
in several categories. Davidson was ranked 21st
and W&L 22nd among the nation’s top liberal
arts colleges. W&L was ranked Ist and David-
son 2nd in the ‘‘Best Buy’’ category.

“T think you can underscore the sim-
ilarities of the schools with the US News &
World Report article,’ said Walsh. ‘‘We are
two schools with like-minded academic inter-
ests. The main difference though, is that while
we are strictly Division III, Davidson is
Division I with the exception of football.”’

Although students and alumni alike
participate in Washington and Lee’s
annual Homecoming activities, few are
aware of the rich history surrounding the
long-standing tradition.

Since its inception, Homecoming
has been observed and interpreted in
many different ways. This supplement is
dedicated to exploring several past and
present Homecoming activities that have
spurred its continuance.

For such spirit with which some
students view Homecoming also may
have inspired the creation many years
ago of a student publication named after
the following football song:

Each other's back ,boys, Has got a knack, boys,

For making gains, sir, Round the end.

And it's a sin, sir, For Oberlin a WerL player], sir,
To buck the V.M.I. boys’ line so awful hard.

Then join the yell, boys, And yell like hell, boys,
Sure enough.

To We&L U., boys, And football, too, boys,

Let's give a rousing, rumbling, roaring, football yell.
Ring-tum phi, stickeri bum!

Bonfires, pajamas distinguish
Homecomings through the years

 

From staff reports

 

1925. The first Homecoming.
On Saturday, November 7th,
1925, thousands of people filled
Wilson Field, bleachers erected on
both sides and both ends of the
field, and all standing space to
watch the Generals under a steady
drizzling rain beat UVa 12-0. Alt-
hough the Homecoming crowd no
longer fills the stands and tra-
ditions changed, W&L still holds
the spirit of that first
homecoming.

The Alumni Magazine for
October 1925 announced the
“First Official Annual Home-
coming Day.’’ Tickets were $2
and the seats were reserved. Alu-
mni were invited to attend a
meeting of the Alumni Associa-
tion, Inc. where they would be
addressed by G.H. Denny, a for-
mer W&L president who had
gone on to become president of
the University of Alabama (which
was sharply criticized elsewhere
in the same issue of the magazine
for stealing the W&L Swing and
calling it the Alabama Swing).
Alumni were also invited to at-
tend classes that morning. ‘‘That
morning’ was Saturday. Things
have changed.

Accommodations were made
for 10,000 people. Fraternity
house managers’ names were
listed in the Alumni Magazine so
alumni could contact them if they
wanted to stay in their fraternity
houses. The railroads offered
special rates from all over the
state to Lexington. Game tickets
were on sale in Roanoke, Lynch-
burg and Staunton.

The night before the game a
pep rally was held and a thousand
people attended. There were
cheers, speeches and a bonfire.

Local merchants were asked to
keep their stores closed during the
afternoon so that everyone in
town could attend the game. It
must have seemed like everyone
in the state was there to watch
the Generals beat UVa. A dance
was held on Saturday night. The
First Official Annual Homecoming
Day was such a success that they
decided to keep doing it.

Many of the traditions which
grew up over the years are now
gone: fraternity decorations, fresh-
man parades, the 13 Club, pep
rallies, the ‘‘Opening Dance.”’

On Friday night, the night
before the big game, the fresh-
men, wearing pajamas, and other
students would gather in the gym
for a pep rally. W&L’s cheer-
leaders would lead the students in
cheers and speeches would be
given by the coaches and players.
In 1955, RJ. Reynolds Tobacco
Company gave 1,000 megaphones
to the students for the pep rally.

The parade must have been a
sight. In 1955 the Phi ran a pic-
ture of the parade. In the picture
was group of students wearing
pajamas, one of them bearing a
placard reading, ‘‘Shove It Up. a
Turkey--Gobble, Gobble.’’

13 days before Homecoming,
the 13 Club would begin its in-
itiation period for 13 new pledges
from 13 different fraternities who
each had paid an initiation fee of
$13.13, At some point during
these 13 days the statue of Cyrus
McCormick, the one standing
guard on front campus, the one
most visitors think is Lee, was
tarred and feathered, and the base
covered with number 13s.

What a fine time it must have
been.

The dates of Homecoming
weekend skipped around through
the years. It was possible for

COURT

HOUSE

 

Homecoming to fall anywhere
between mid october and late
november before settling down to
its present position of early oc-
tober. Homecoming has occured
every year since 1925, except for
1954 when the festivities were
cancelled. Every so often Home-
coming and Openings were com-
bined, like in 1962 and ’65.
Saturday of Homecoming
would usually begin with a foot-
ball game, just as it does now,
but without the liquid pleasure of
recent years. In the 1955 Home-
coming issue of the Phi the EC
stated that its policy against

Saturday service
set for Lee Chapel

 

By Joyce Bautista
Staff Reporter

 

“‘In essential respects his spirit
beautifully lives before and with
the boys. The ultimate monument
to him is the University which has
now linked his name with that of
Washington in its title. There was
a university which was dead and
he made it alive. It is alive today
largely in the mold he formed for
it; it breathes the inspiration he
brought.”’

-Dr. Francis Pendelton Gaines,
former Washington and Lee Presi-
dent

This Saturday marks the 121st
aniversary of the death of General
Robert E. Lee, president of, then
Washington College, from 1865 to
1870. Capt. Robert C. Peniston,
director of Lee Chapel, will be
the featured speaker for the un-
viersity’s annual memorial service,
sponsored by the W&L Alumni
Association and two Civil War
reenactment groups, honoring Lee.

“I accepted the offer to speak

at the memorial service with
pleasure,’’ Peniston said. “‘It’s a
great honor for a non-alumnus to
be asked to do this.’’

Peniston’s speech will mark
the first time he has delivered
featured remarks at W&L,
although he has served as direc-
tor of Lee Chapel for more than
a decade.

According to Peniston, his
speech is based on the West Point
motto ‘‘Duty, Honor, Country.”’
“Lee grew up under this motto,’’
said Peniston, a ’46 alumnus of
the United States Naval Academy
in Annapolis, Md. ‘‘I think the
whole country should take heed
GE At”

Peniston, a retired Navy cap-
tain after 30 years, says since
becoming director of Lee Chapel
his admiration for the Lee family
has grown. ‘‘He saved the place,’’
Peniston said, ‘tand set a standard
that presidents have been trying to
match ever since.”’

Peniston, an avid teller of
tales, recalls a Lee remark he
stumbled across in his reading:

“‘When [Lee] asked what rules
were in effect at then Washington
College, the general replied, ‘We
have no rules here except that
every student be a gentleman.”

Peniston says he will stress in
his speech Lee’s contribution of
an Honor Code similar to that of
his Alma Mater, West Point.
‘Very simply, this is his legacy
to the school he rescued from the
ash heap of war.”’

He also cited tangible signs of
Lee’s influence on the college,
such as the chapel, the Commerce
school and the school of Jour-
nalism, which were established
to provide students with choice,

which he said was very important
to Lee.

And Peniston should know the
makings of a a great man, for he
has been in the presence of of
formidable gentlemen. Because of
his profession and rank, he has
met numerous presidents, such as
Truman, and international figures,
such as Winston Churchill.

His career at Washington and
Lee began 15 years ago when he
was asked to be the new director
of Lee Chapel. His ties to the
university run even deeper. His
son graduated from W&L in ‘75
and his son-in-law in ‘76.

According to Peniston, the

memorial service tradition began
five years ago when he was asked
if it could be held in Lee Chapel.

As part of the ceremony,
Peniston personally rings the
chapel’s bells 19 times, the e-
quivalent of a 19 gun salute.
“That is how many he would
have been entitled to as the com-
mander-in-chief of the
Confederate forces,’’ Peniston
said.

The service will begin Satur-
day at 9:30 a.m, the time of
Lee’s death in 1870. At that
time, the Liberty Hall Volunteers,

The Ring-tum Phi Homecoming Supplement, October 10, 1991

It takes more than beauty to be W&L's queen

 

By Smith Carlson
Staff Reporter

 

‘‘We're looking for someone
with a strong sense of values;
someone who is intelligent. We’re
looking for the girl who best
represents Washington and Lee,”’
explained Robert de Maria, chair-
man of this year’s Homecoming
Queen Selection Committee.

“It is very difficult,’’ he said.
‘‘Last year any of them would
have been a great representative.’’

The judges, who are faculty
members selected by the Alumni
Relations staff and the student
alumni-relations group Kathekon,
include: de Maria, University
Librarian Barbara Brown, Cam-
paign Events Coordinator Chris-
tine Davis, former Director of
Security Charles Murray and
Chemistry Prof. Michael Pleva.

They have the responsibility of
interviewing candidates and deter-
mining which nominee is best
suited for the title. They will
judge the contestants on poise,
appearance, and activities.

The process begins with the
announcement of candidates from
various campus organizations. To
be eligible, an organization must
be officially recognized by the
university.

Mostly fraternities and
sororities submit nominees, how-
ever representatives from the
Minority Students Association, the
Independent Students Union, the
International Club and the W&L
Law School’s Student Bar As-
sociation, 24 in all, have been
announced.

In choosing a candidate, many
groups take far more into con-
sideration than simply appearance.

Sigma Chi fraternity took
several factors into account.
‘She helped us out a lot last
year,”’ said sophomore Trevor
Norris of the group’s nominee.
‘She hangs out at the house and
is a good friend.”’

An organization’s representa-
tive does not necessarily have to
attend W&L either. The only
current requirement for nominees
is that they attend a college or
university, although in past years
several wives of W&L students
have been elected queen. Some
fraternities have even dolled up
their members and presented them
in drag.

didate this year is a student at

Mary Baldwin. ‘‘We all know her
and we get along really well,’’
said an SAE member. ‘‘It was a
unanimous vote.’’

The International Club, which
elected a new vice-president and
a Homecoming representative at
the same meeting, went so far as
to make up ballots for their
nominations.

Contest coordinators Rob Mish
and recent graduate Chris Baradel
described the type of female they
think organizations tend to chose
as their nominee.

‘*Fraternities want a girl who
comes to the house, who is
known by the fraternity, and who
is well-liked,’’ said Baradel, him-
self a graduated Pi Kappa Alpha
member.

Others however, said they
consider other criteria. One frater-
nity member said his house’s
nominee was friends with only a
few of its members and probably
had not set foot in the house, but
the group chose her because ‘‘We
wanted someone who could win,”’
he said candidly.

On Friday, the proffered can-
didates will assemble for inter-
views with the judges. Each inter-
view lasts approximately seven
minutes and consists of three pre-
agreed upon questions.

The questions, explained de
Maria, are thought provoking.
“It’s important that we get to
know her,’’ he said. ‘‘And seven
minutes is not long to do that
fart

 

Following the interviews, the
judges will compare notes and the
process of elimination begins.
After careful consideration, the
judges come up with two finalists
an the queen.

According to Associate Alumni
Relations Director Robert Mish,
no duties go along with the title,
and that winners typically return
the crown to a university official
after half-time.

The court will officially be
presented during half-time at the
Homecoming game on Saturday.

Student Body President Giles
Perkins will introduce the court,
and amidst much anticipation,
announce the name of W&L’s
Queen for a day.

W&L can’t evade
football spirit

By Jacob Kimball
Staff Reporter

 

For well over a century, foot-
ball has been a part of the
Washington and Lee tradition. At
times the small campus has even
received national attention for its
exploits on the gridiron, and was
considered a force on the national
college football scene. During this
time span the game of football
changed drastically, as did its role
on this campus.

The history of W&L football
goes back to the year 1873, as the
first contest occurred only eight
years after the inception of the
now well-entrenched honor code.
The program consisted of a series
of games with the nearby Virginia
Military Institute and a few other
schools.

The schedule gradually expand-
ed to include a broader set of
opponents, while games with VMI
developed into battles for bragg-
ing rights.

In the early 20th century, W&L
started producing some sensa-
tional team and individual perfor-
mances. The revered Cy Young,

who earned sixteen varsity letters
along the way, led the first of the
college’s truly dominating teams.
The teams of 1912 to 1915 relied
heavily on Young’s talent as they
amassed a total of 32 wins against
only 3 losses and one tie.

In 1954 two players were
caught turning in tests with exact-
ly the same responses. The whole
situation was turned over to the
Executive Committee, and when
the dust had settled, 14 football
players and one cheerleader, had
withdrawn from the school due to
incriminating evidence.

This cheating scandal, coupled
with the debt that had accumu-
lated due to athletic scholarships,
forced the Board of Trustees into
making a decision concerning the
future of football at W&L.

The Trustees decided to de-
emphasize the program amid fer-
vent protests from some alumni.
This decision was based on the
conclusion that the university
could no longer continue to strike
a balance between _ strong
academics and big-time football.

After this decision the program
started from scratch, because most

of the remaining scholarship play-

Trustees to terminate athietic scholarships.

ers left, and expected freshman
recruits went elsewhere. Things did
not start to look up until Lee Mc-
Laughlin was hired as head coach.

In a tribute to McLaughlin’s
coaching ability and enthusiastic
play of his players, the Generals
turned in back-to-back immaculate
seasons.

The 1961 team received recog-

nition as the best small team in the
nation after its undefeated season.
This designation was given by the
Washington Touchdown Club, and
again the spirit of college football
gripped the campus.

The Trustees stuck to their
policy of no more athletic
scholarships with conviction, while
still retaining its high academic

only at

standards for those on or off the
playing field.

According to Frank Parsons,
long-time university publicist, the
men who composed the teams of
this new era were quality individu-
als with a strong sense of camara-
derie, that would be upheld to the
present.

Cheerleaders once led rallys, game cheers

 

By Alisha Johnson
Staff Reporter

 

They just don’t make
Homecoming like they used to.

Male cheerleaders no longer
lead spirited students in the
‘Washington and Lee Swing’’ at
pep rallies, and parades featuring
pajama-clad freshmen carrying
traditional homecoming torches no
longer march through downtown
Lexington.

Many of the activities which

enhanced the homecoming
celebration have fallen by the
wayside.

According to a former W&L
head cheerleader, Leigh Allen,
60, the most important activities
during homecoming week were

—VARNER & POLE

the fraternity decorations competi-
tion and the pep rallies.

‘The fraternities used to have
decorations for their houses, and
an award would be given for the
best decorations made,’’ Allen
said. ‘‘We also always had a pep
rally where the cheerleaders
would lead the students in cheers.
None of our cheers were really
unique to the school except, of
course, the good ole ‘W&L
Swing’ which all the students
liked.”’

Allen said that tryouts and
practices for the cheerleading
squad were not very intense, but
entertaining nevertheless.

‘There were about eight or
nine of us on the team,’’ said
Allen, who was cheerleader for
three years. ‘‘Different frater-

nities encouraged people to try-
out, and the captain of the squad
picked who he thought was best.
There was really no intense com-
petition. We just liked to have a
lot of fun. The cheerleaders
didn’t really take it too serious-
ly.”

At one time W&L had a six
female cheerleaders, who were
recruited from nearby Southern
Seminary.

Allen added that a cheerlead-
ing squad would help current
students get back into the spirit of
homecoming.

“I think it would be a good
idea for W&L to have cheerlead-
ing again,’’ Allen said. ‘‘Having
women on campus now would
make the team even better...at
least they would be much cuter to

watch. With a little leadership, it
[cheerleading] would be an addi-
tional feature at the ball game.’’

Assistant Director of Alumni
Programs Rob Mish agreed that
steps should be taken to stir up
homecoming spirit.

‘I don’t remember there being
anything really special about
Homecoming while I was here,”’
said Mish, who graduated from
W&L in 1976.

According to Mish, many of
the homecoming activities
embraced by W&L’s student body
through the 50s and ’60s got
pushed aside by the apprehension
of the Vietnam War.

stopped in the early ’70s, around

Fa LaLa
‘W&L Swing’ is still popular

 

By Nicole Keeler
Staff Reporter

Though Washington and Lee
has long since deemphasized its
collegiate athletics department, the
‘‘Washington and Lee Swing’’
has remained for 80 years the
most popular and most widely
imitated fight song in collegiate
history.

According to a Washington
and Lee Alumni magazine article
written by Robert B. James Jr.
the ‘‘W&L Swing’’ has had ‘‘had
a history as stormy as it is fas-
cinating.”’

According to James, the
melody was originally composed
in 1905 by Mark Sheafe, a W&L
student from South Dakota.
Though he graduated the next
year the tune was kept alive by
members of the  university’s

Guitar Club with whom it re-
mained a favorite.

However, the song remained
without lyrics until 1909 when
two other W&L students, Thorn-
ton W. Allen and Clarence T.
Robbins heard the music and
composed its words, setting the
Swing apart as the first victory
song ever composed for a univer-
sity by its students.

The Swing was an immediate
success and was quickly adopted
by other universities. Many
adapted the lyrics with little
regard for copyright laws.

James related how both Tulane
and Alabama took the Swing as
their air. When they faced each
other in 1931, the clash caused a
great deal of confusion and anger,
he said.

The ‘‘W&L Swing” has also
been used as the theme song for

 

Cheerleaders on the 1960 squad practice for the next big game

A copy of it was even carried
into space on the Shuttle
Columbia by U.S. astronaut
and W&L graduate G. David Low
a few years ago. Low and other
Columbia . crew members were
later roused by strains of the
Swing from NASA headquarters.

In 1958, Louis ‘Satchmo’
Armstrong played at a W&L
Homecoming ‘‘and ended on a
screaming note with ‘Washington
and Lee Swing’,”’ according to
one publication.

__ Al this in addition to spurr-
ing on countless college and high
school athletic teams to victory.

James said that despite its age,
the ‘‘W&L Swing’ is, ‘‘ the
most popular football song ever
written,””

the time that Fancy Dress went
out,’’ he said. ‘‘When students
found out they had the Vietnam
War to deal with, the idea of
Homecoming spirit wasn’t a
priority. Fancy Dress started up
again in 1974, but a lot of the
homecoming activities never came
back.’’

Mish expressed interest in
seeing the ‘‘Torchless Torchlight
Parade’’ return to Washington and
Lee. According to a Ring-Tum
Phi article dated Nov. 6, 1959,
the fiery parade through town
followed a pep rally each year to
open the festivities for W&L’s
homecoming weekend.

“Freshmen will wear pajamas
to the pep rally and for the
parade which follows,’’ the article
stated. ‘‘Leading the parade will
be...members from the ROTC and
University band. Following the
band will be cars carrying the
various fraternities’ Homecoming
queen nominees, and then the
pajama-clad frosh.”’

On behalf of the univeristy,
Mish said ‘‘The Alumni Office is
very aware that [Homecoming
activities] have gone by the
wayside. For this reason we have
given Kathekon’ more
responsibility with Homecoming
this year. In talking to the group,

the students seem _ very
interested.’
Kathekon President Laura

Pilachowski said she would like
to see the organization bring spirit
back into Homecoming. For ex-
ample, she said Kathekon is
trying to get the ‘‘W&L Swing’
printed on cups which will be
passed out at the football game.

Pilachowski said she would
like to see such activities as
fraternity decorations and parades
begin again, as well.

a group of W&L students and
employees interested in Civil War
reenactment, will march from
Washington Hall on the W&L
campus to Lee Chapel for the
memorial service, according to a
campus press release.

The invocation and benediction
will be delivered by Louis W.
Hodges, professor of religion at
W&L.

Joan Brooks of the Virgina
chapter of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy will also
speak, along with W&L
sophomore Christian Keller who
will read from Douglas Southall
Freeman’s R.E. Lee , the passage
in which the general’s last words
are spoken.

The service will end with the
music selections by Southern
Comfort and JubiLee, and will
include General Lee’s favorite
hymn, ‘*How Firm a
Foundation.’

On Saturday night a dance,
would be held in a lavishly dec-
orated Doremus Gymnasium.
Beginning in 1957 with the first
Homecoming Queen, the Queen
would be crowned at the dance.
Until last year, Dr. Shillington
had kissed all of the Queens with
very few interuptions.

The last mention in the Phi of
a house winning a decorations
award was Lambda Chi in 1969,
and a writer in that same issue
wrote, ‘‘It seems that for the most
part, an alumnus returning to
campus is a lonely experience.’’
By 1970, the only mention
made in the Phi of Homecoming
was that it existed and there
would be a concert Friday night
and the game Saturday followed
by a grain party in Red Square
sponsored by the sophmore class.

To the dear old college

 

In 1971 Homecoming was noth-
ing but a small picture in the Phi,

in the lower left hand comer of
the front page, of Shillington
kissing the Queen.

But W&L was never a big
school. The teeming thousands
that once filled Wilson Field are
back to a scale more in line with
a small college. But some things
here will never change.

On that first Homecoming
Day, back in 1925, former W&L
President G.H.Denny praised
W&L with words that still hold
true. ‘Take away from many a
college its endowment and what
is left?”” asked Denny, ‘‘But strip
the Washington and Lee Campus
of every building and every dol-
lar, and there are left some things
more precious than silver and
gold.’ That hasn’t changed.

Come You Back to Washington and Lee

By the banks of Old North River,
Winding lazy ‘round the hill,

campus

My thoughts are turning still;
For the college bells are calling,

And I know they say to me,
Come you back you old Alumnus,

Back to Washington and Lee.
Ship me back to Old Virginia

Where the summer skies are blue;
‘Where the gods walk on the hill-tops

In the sunsets rosy hue;
For I've heard their voices calling,

And its there that I would be,
In the shadow of the mountains-

Back at Washington and Lee.

 

 

Davidson and W&L haven't
met on the football field since
1978, during Head Coach Gary
Fallon’s first season at W&L.
Davidson, then Division I, won
easily 34-7. But in the two col-
lege’s football history, a Davidson
win has been the exception rather
than the rule.

Both schools were members of
the Southern Conference in the
1940s and early 1950s and did
battle on the gridiron for 13
straight years. W&L dominated
the series, winning 11, losing one
and tying one. In overall games,
W&L holds a 13-8-1 edge,
Davidson has won in the college’s
last four football games since
W&L dropped athletic scholar-
ships in 1954.

“The rivalry has seen good
athletic competition in the past,
and we look forward to continu-
ing the tradition,’ Walsh said.

Walsh announced that Satur-
day’s football game will be the
first in a string of renewed com-
petitions with Davidson. Because
Davidson is Division I in other
sports, he said it will be difficult

for W&L to maintain a rivalry
with the Wildcats.

“It’s a decent rivalry,’’ said
Walsh. ‘‘They are a school that
we want to play, and enjoy play-
ing against, but that’s mostly in
individual sports. They have a
little bit of an upper hand because
they are Division I.”’

Walsh said he hopes that the
athletic competition will again
grow to the level it had reached
before the teams stopped playing
each other.

Both teams will enter Satur-
day’s game with _ struggling
records. Davidson is 1-3 while
W&L is 0-4. Davidson's strength
lies in its running game, led by
freshman fullback Bruce Bannister
and quarterback Richard
Howell. Bannister has run for 287
yards on just 36 carries, and
Davidson averages 192 yards
rushing per game.

W&L has struggled offensive-
ly, averaging just 98 yards per
game. Senior Jeff Kreis leads the
team with seven catches, and
senior George Sakin and junior
Wade Robinett each have six.

Petition
protests

gallery

By Leigh Allen
Staff Reporter

 

 

Student opposition to the location
of the proposed Reeves Center expan-
sion project is being expressed throu-
gh a petition aimed at preventing
construction of the front campus
building.

Junior Richard Chapman is or-
ganizing the petition drive to oppose
the location of the Watson Gallery.

“I’m not opposed to the Univer-
sity accepting the gift. I’m just
opposed to the location of the build-
ing. I don’t think we need another
building on the front campus,’” Chap-
man said.

The proposed Watson Gallery will
be built directly behind the current
Reeves Center and next to Tucker
Hall. It will house an Oriental arts
and ceramics exhibit donated to the
University by Mrs. William Watson
and her late husband William Watson,
a graduate of the University.

Funding for construction and
maintenance of the gallery will also
be donated by the Mrs. Watson, ac-
cording to University President John
D. Wilson.

Final approval for the gallery has
not been granted by the Board of
Trustees.

Chapman said he plans to submit
his petition to the Board when it
takes up the matter at its Board meet-
ing next Thursday.

‘I just want the Board to be
aware of the fact that there is student
opposition to the location of the
building,’’ Chapman said.

Chapman has been collecting
signatures in front of the Co-op duri-
ng the day and in Evans Dining Hall
in the evenings. Copies of the peti-
tion have ,also been distributed to
fraternity chapters.

According to Chapman, he has
collected between 700 and 800 signa-
tures to oppose the building and has
been pleased with the response.

‘I’m hoping to collect signatures
from at least a majority of the stu-
dents before going to the Board,”’
Chapman said.

A VMI cadet has been charged
with rape and sodomy in connection
with the sexual assault of a W&L
freshman in her Gilliam dorm room
Sunday morning.

Chad E. Hudnall, 18, of Newport
News, Va., is being held in Rock-
bridge Regional Jail in lieu of
$25,000 bond.

Hudnall, a sophomore at Virginia
Military Institute, entered the
woman’s unlocked room about 4 a.m.
and attacked her while she slept,
Lexington Chief of Police Bruce
Beard said.

There are conflicting reports of
how the woman escaped.

Beard said three Washington and

Lee men heard her scream and rushed
into the room. The men called W&L
Security and held Hudnall until they
arrived, Beard said.

Michael Young, W&L director of
security, said the woman awoke,
escaped Hudnall, and ran screaming
into the hall. Some W&L students
detained Hudnall there and called
security, Young said. Security then
called Lexington Police.

The woman said she did not know
Hudnall, according to Beard.

Police in Newport News are in-
vestigating a separate charge of a
sexual nature there involving Hudnall,
Beard said.

In addition, Hudnall was indicted
on one count of burglary and one
count of grand larceny in Newport
News _ Tuesday, said B.B. Under-
wood, deputy clerk of the Newport

News Circuit Court. An additional
burglary charge involving Hudnall is
now before a Newport News grand
jury, Underwood said.

Hudnall’s attorney, Anita Filson,
did not return three phone calls Wed-
nesday.

The Rev. Charles C. Caudill, VMI
chaplain, said he had spoken with
Hudnall, but could not reveal the
nature of their discussion.

This is the fourth reported inci-
dent of sexual assault at W&L since
August. In the first case, W&L senior
Marcus Miller was charged with
breaking into the home of a female
WA&L student’s home and attempting
to rape her after she had passed out.
In a plea bargain agreement, the
defendant pled guilty to trespassing.

The other two cases involved

Young and Beard said Hudnall
entered the hall through an unlocked
door.

Although W&L Security locks the
doors to every freshman hall every
night at 11 p.m. and checks them
periodically, Young said students
generally unlock them or prop them
open.

“‘The security patrol system is
adequate, and the checks are made
within a reasonable time,’’ Young
said. ‘‘It’s when the doors are
propped open that the system fails.’’

He stressed that students must
realize that Lexington and W&L are
not any safer than other communities
across the country.

‘*Times are changing and we need
to change with them,’’ Young said.

to determine senior Courtney Hall’s blood-alcohol concentration at
Wednesday night’s controlled drinking experiment in the GHQ.

Students test alcohol
tolerance at the GHQ

 

By Alisha Johnson
Staff Reporter

 

Sixteen students received free
drinks last night, compliments of
Washington and Lee's Health
Education Committee.

The committee, with the Student
Activities Board and Food Service,
sponsored its annual controlled
drinking experiment in the Generals
Headquarters.

Junior Dionne Blyden,  co-
chairwoman of Alcohol Awareness
Month activities, said the experiments
Wednesday night tested the body’s
alcohol tolerance, comparing three
categories of drinkers.

‘The categories consist of
drinkers who stop eating after 4 p.m.,

those who eat dinner before drinking,
and those who eat dinner and munch
high protein snacks while drinking,”’
Blyden said.

Males and females of various
weights participated in each category
and were encouraged to drink at their
own pace.

Throughout the night Lexington
police officers administered a
breathalizer test every 30 minutes to
participants and other curious
students. That test measured the time
it took for individuals to reach .10

percent blood-alcohol content,
Virginia's legal threshold of
intoxication.

Results showed that small-framed
individuals who had not eaten since 4

p.m. became intoxicated faster than
the other drinkers

Rally, sign-up ope

A women’s fraternity rally and
Rush sign-up will welcome Pi Beta
Phi sorority to Washington and Lee
Friday afternoon.

From 4 p.m. to 5:30 p.m., all
university women, including fresh-
men, upperclass students and present
sorority members, may attend a mixer
in the Baker-Davis-Gilliam quad.

Women may register for Rush and
hear a presentation given by Pi Beta

Phi.

‘*All of the present W&L soror-
ities will be there in support of Pi
{Beta] Phi and rush sign-ups,’’ Pan-
hellenic Council President Dale Wyatt
said.

‘“‘We want to encourage all
women to attend,’’ Wyatt said. ‘‘It is
important that everyone appreciates
and stresses the inclusiveness of our
system.”

Including Pi Beta Phi at W&L
has meant promising that its chapter
size will be comparable to that of the
other sororities in just a few years.

Wyatt said Pi Beta Phi’s pledge
class this year will be significantly
larger than that of the other three
sororities.

She declined to estimate how the
rushees will be divided among the
four groups.

Wyatt indicated that the new
pledge classes for the three es-
tablished sororities will be a lot smal-
ler than the 34-member groups they
received last year.

Wyatt says she hopes the
decreased chance of joining one of
the three existing groups will not

She said rush counselors are en-

Pi Beta  Phi’s national
representatives will arrive in Lexi-

the campus and city. They will also
meet with PHC to discuss January
rush plans.

If women are unable to attend the
sign-up Friday, the final deadline for
applications is Nov. 1, and rush
forms can be obtained from rush
counselors.

Campus in crisis

In the past two and a half months there have been three
rapes and one sexual assault reported on or near the
Washington and Lee campus. In a report released Monday,
five sophomores said they were raped during their freshman
year. Since school began, there have been reports of
burglaries in the dorms, beatings in the streets, mayhem at
fraternity parties.

Clearly, this university is in crisis.

Never before have we been assaulted with such shocking
evidence of the violent nature of life at W&L. Our veneer
of gentility and civility has been stripped away and the raw,
cold, heartless underside of our community has been
exposed for the whole world to see.

There are two problems that need attention in these
matters: first, the well-meaning but ineffective leadership of
the administration and the student government, and second,
the tolerance of the student body of clearly inappropriate
behavior.

Will those in leadership roles on this campus simply try
to cover the exposed ugliness and replace W&L’s mask of
perfection, or will they take this opportunity to repair the
decay underneath? Will students recognize the violent nature
of their actions or will they continue blindly, believing that
recent events are an exception and not the rule?

The first step toward healing has already been taken. The
victims who had the courage to report crimes against them
and to press charges against the accused have begun the
process of healing for the university. It is unfortunate, but
true, that they will be blamed by many people for being
trouble-makers. Rather, they are the heroes who have opened
up the wound so it can be cleaned.

In the coming weeks, we will offer suggestions to both
students and university leaders as we all, together, begin the
process of rebuilding what at one time must have been a
true code of gentlemanly behavior.

Still unaware

In this designated week and month of alcohol awareness,
it is clear that most of the effort expended on the program
is going to waste. The university’s approach to the subject

is so mundane that students are tuning out the message.

There are three basic flaws in the current approach to
alcohol awareness programming: public relations, overkill,
and outlook. These, flaws explain the. ‘programa’ s, limited
success. «4 3) oats

Most students: who went to hone! ‘guest inaiieer aad
recovering alcoholic Mike Green found his presentation both
entertaining and constructive. But not many students went,
mostly because the poster advertising the event was boring
with only a picture of Green’s face, his name, the topic of
the talk, and when and where. That is an example of bad
public relations.

Simply that the talk had to do with alcohol awareness
might have been enough to turn students away. The univer-
sity’s blitzkrieg approach to alcohol awareness generally
leaves students more sick of the topic than they get from
drinking too much. Alcohol awareness meets you at every
turn. That is overkill.

Among the leaflets available in the University Center is
a survey that asks the reader to answer 20 questions,
including, number one, ‘‘Do you lose time from classes due
to drinking?’’ Most of the questions ask for no account of
frequency or habit. If you answer yes to only three ques-
tions, the survey says you are problem drinker. That is
simply not definitively true by any realistic standard.

The goals of the Alcohol Awareness Program are noble
and justified, but there is tremendous room for improvement.
First, improve public relations, being aware of the audience
and competing interests. Second, overcome overkill; rather
than one week of overkill and 29 weeks of ignorance, the
program’s resources would best be spread over the year.
Third, have a realistic outlook; don’t promote resources that
insult a student’s ability to drink responsibly.

Judge Thomas: examining the jury

 

MY VIEW
By Richard E. Hill, Jr.

 

A few observations regarding the confirmation

hearings of Clarence Thomas:
The Winners

Clarence Thomas — By the time that this goes
to press, hopefully he will have already been
confirmed. If not, it is my feeling that the hearts
of the American people go out to him and his
family. He has experienced not the American
dream, but an American nightmare. He has been
dragged through the mud by the liberal
establishment and by the media and I am ashamed
as a fellow citizen of this nation that he has had to
endure such a thing.

Arlen Specter and Dennis DeConcini — Both
voted against Bork and both support Thomas.
Specter’s performance last weekend did justice to
his reputation as a vigorous and_ successful
prosecutor. DeConcini has earned my respect by
standing by Thomas, despite the fact that his
Democratic colleagues on the committee seem to
want to stop at nothing to derail his nomination.

Orrin Hatch — As usual, the senior Senator
from Utah has demonstrated his capacity as a
brilliant legal mind and as a pillar of honesty and
fairness. But, he can be a firebrand when he wants

to, and there were times, during. these , hearings _
when he showed. this. country what he is made of..

there will

Hopefully, be a Supreme Court

nomination in his future.:Let’s see! the liberals try |

Miller responds
to Phi article

To the Editor:

After reading last week’s headline story, I
was appalled and thoroughly disgusted in the
way that I was treated in that article. I was
shocked to discover that quite a few details of
the article were either misleading or not fact-
based. It seems to me that accurate reporting
means covering a story from both sides and not
choosing one. Last week’s article violated these
principles in the fact that only the person
pressing the charges was interviewed. My side of
the story was never told and, as a result, thou-
sands of people now only see me in the eyes of
my accusers. Several of the accusations against
me were biased and false. The term slander
comes to mind at a time like this. I feel my
character and rights as a person have also been
unjustly violated. I would point out that I was
charged with simple trespass, a very minor
offense. I would hope that my fellow students
would realize that if the allegations of my
accusers were true, then neither the judge nor the
prosecuting attorney would have agreed to reduce
the charge. I would also like to thank all those
who have been behind me in all this, and I think
it is now time to let this issue rest.

Sincerely,
Marcus L. Miller

EC President
urges caution

To the Editor:

I write to you in reaction to the troubling
events that have plagued our campus during the
last few weeks. I want to share my perspective
as to what has happened and how we should
react.

Primarily, 1 urge caution. We all enjoy the
benefits and freedoms that stem from living in
an environment of trust. However, this trust has
been violated, and we must now recognize that
all individuals on this campus must protect their
personal safety.

Furthermore, we have a duty to look after
one another. Do not let fellow students endanger
themselves. We also have a duty to send out our
support to those who have already been harmed.
Rape is a crime against our very society, and the
survivors should not be subject to rumors or
ridicule,

Finally, I want to ask you to join together in
dealing with the problems before us. We are
most effective as a community.

Sincerely,
Giles Perkins
Executive Committee President

 

with Robert Gates,
Constitution. The founding fathers would be
appalled if they saw what advice and consent has’

and dig up sleaze on him.

Allen Simpson — He told Nina Totenberg off!
What else needs to be said?

The Jury Is Still Out

Joseph Biden — I saw a rare side of Biden this
weekend, but it wasn’t always consistent. At one
moment he would come across as exceedingly fair
and impress the pants off me; yet, in the next, he
would do something that made him look rather
ridiculous. He did make a statement on polygraphs
that demonstrated to me that he is not simply a
partisan tool. It went something to the effect of
“‘our country has reached a sad state of affairs
when polygraph results become the deciding factor
in a dispute.’’ Hats off to you on that one, Joe!
(He even got commended by Thurmond and Hatch
on that statement.) He could really impress me by
changing his vote and supporting Thomas, but I
don’t think that is likely to happen.

Howell Heflin — He voted against Thomas, but
he has a sharp mind and strikes me as being fair
and honest.

The Losers

The Confirmation Process — When a Senate
confirmation hearing degenerates into an
inquisition, the likes of which this country hasn’t
seen since the days of McCarthy, the voters of this
nation and every member of the U.S. Senate have
some major soul searching to do. What this
country has witnessed, not only with Thomas, but
is a_ disgrace to the

become.

 

LETTERS

 

Cartoon biased,
ignores issue

To the Editor:

I am a resident of Massachusetts and as such
would be the first to admit that Senator Ted
Kennedy often displays a lack of common sense,
to say the least. For this, he deserves all the bad
press and criticism the media can muster. How-
ever, Tim Molloy’s recent cartoon concerning
Senator Kennedy and Ms. Anita Hill showed a
total lack of understanding as to the real issue at
hand. Molloy’s cartoon was totally lacking in
good sense and taste, not to mention fact!

The fact that you, the editors, allowed this
cartoon to be printed shows a lack of good
judgement on your part. I was under the im-
pression that the purpose of The Ring-tum Phi
was to produce as professional a newspaper as
possible. I seriously doubt if any professional
publication would print such a blatantly hostile
piece. Mr. Molloy’s cartoon certainly shows a
predisposed dislike for Senator Kennedy. This is
unfortunate as it serves only to belittle the
serious charges that have been placed before the
Judiciary Committee.

Rather than making baseless charges against
Senator Kennedy and Ms. Hill, would it not
have been more constructive to do an editorial
on sexual harassment, after all, that is the real
issue here. These hearings, whatever their out-
come, have raised very significant questions as
to the occupational ethics of many Americans.
These questions are not going to go away, no
matter how much people like Mr. Molloy ‘‘poke
fun’? at them. To me, Mr. Molloy’s cartoon
shows either a fear of this issue or a total lack
of understanding as to the severity of sexual
harassment. Either way, I would hope that in the
future the editors and staff of The Ring-tum Phi,
would consider more carefully the profes-
sionalism of that which they choose to print.

Sincerely yours,
Patrick McDermott, '94

(Ed. note: This letter and the next were written
before the Senate voted 52-48 Tuesday to confirm
Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.)

Ted Kennedy — i"!
I must laugh! When are the voters from
Massachusetts going to wise up? A man such as
this doesn’t deserve to sit in judgement of Attila
the Hun, let alone Clarence Thomas.

Howard Metzenbaum — I never knew that one
individual could be so cruel, so partisan, and so
downright nauseating. If it is proven that he or his
staff leaked the F.B.I. report to the press, than he
should have an ethics hearing that makes this one
look like a court date for a speeding ticket. I
apologize to Robert E. Lee for mentioning him and
Kennedy on this campus.

Herb Kohl, Patrick Leahy, and Paul Simon -
- Each is useless in their own right. I feel sorry
for the states that they represent.

Anita Hill — I feel sorry for her, because her
life will never be the same. It is difficult to pass
judgement on her. I have a feeling that she is
being used by people who couldn’t give a damn
about her feelings, and she just doesn’t realize it.
It is also conceivable, and, perhaps, even likely
that she honestly believes every word she told that
committee.

The allegations of sexual harassment had to be
addressed, I don’t question that. It is simply the
way that it was handled that infuriates me. To steal
an expression from the movie True Believer, only
three people know the truth of these allegations:
Anita hill, Clarence Thomas, and God. Thomas
and Hill are diametrically opposed on every
account. God isn’t talking. I believe Clarence
Thomas, ‘and I support him. He'll make a fine
addition to the Supreme Court.

 

cial branches. Thomas has stirred up debate
across the United States for two fundamental
reasons. First, he opposes abortion, and secondly,
he opposes affirmative action. For thes two
reasons, many special interest groups have fran-
tically sought for any way to block his entry
onto the Supreme Court. Their last, and final,
assault came with the claim that he sexually
harassed Anita Hill.

At a fundamental level, those in Congress
who oppose Thomas have done so all along on
political grounds, and not for reasons of his lack
of capability or integrity. If Thomas loses the
battle, this will prove that Congress now has
supreme power over the Judicial branch of
government, and that Congress will only confirm
those who pay homage to special groups, and to
liberal congressmen and congresswomen. Gone
are the days when a judge can think for himself
or herself.

A simple message for judges aspiring to
serve on the Supreme Court: Do not make
decisions based on what you really believe, but
on what will gain you the least harassment from
Congress.

Frank Martien, '92

Next week, the Lexington Planning Commission will debate granting Delta Tau Delta
a conditional use permit for renovations on their fraternity house, shown above. Delt
is the last fraternity house that must appear before the commission.

City to discuss Delt

 

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

 

The Lexington Planning Commission will
hold a public hearing next Thursday to discuss
granting a conditional use permit to the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity house.

Scheduled to undergo the Fraternity Renais-
sance program in January, Delt is the final
fraternity house that needs planning commission
approval.

Lexington Building and Zoning Ad-
ministrator Bill Blatter told the planning com-
mission last Thursday that he sees only benefits
from approving the permit application.

“Delta Tau Delta can continue to exist as it
is if we deny the application, and I see that the
proposed renovations will only make the house
better,’’ Blatter said. ‘‘The question is, how
will the public respond?”’

Delt currently has a non-conforming use
permit which allows the fraternity to remain
indefinitely in violation of Lexington zoning
laws. But, the complete renovation of the

house, called for by the Renaissance plan,
invalidates that permit.

University Coordinator of Capital Planning
Frank Parsons said that parking is bound to be
the most controversial issue before the plann-
ing commission.

Under the Renaissance plans, Delt residents
will park in the Chi Psi parking lot in order to
adhere to Lexington’s one bed, one space rule.
Delt currently has only six parking spaces.

The house’s proposed renovations to the
site include trees and a fence, both intended to
reduce noise coming from the house.

The public hearing, on Oct. 24 at 5 p.m. in
City Hall, will allow the public a chance to
address the planning commission before it
votes. If the planning commission approves the
plan, it must also win approval from the Lexi-
ngton City Council.

Parsons does not see any major roadblocks
in front of the petition.

“I think the Delts are pretty good ne-
ighbors for the people they live around,’
Parsons said. ‘‘There shouldn’t be a problem on
this, but I’ve misplaced my confidence before.’’

CDs missing
from dorm

By Summer Brown
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

Students in Graham-Lees dormitory lock their doors
since more than 70 compact discs were taken from an
unlocked room Oct. 5.

Whitney Bludworth, a freshman, left his room un-
locked and found his compact disc collection missing.

Robert Eison, a friend of Bludworth, returned a
borrowed CD around 11 p.m. and noticed the others
missing. Bludworth returned about 2 a.m. and informed
Washington and Lee Security and the Lexington Police
Department.

Eison said he had seen two unfamiliar men in the hall
three different times that night but didn’t think much of
it.

“I haven’t seen them on campus before. They would
leave every time I walked out into the hall,’’ Eison said.
“‘T wasn’t suspicious until I found out the CDs were
missing.”

The strangers were described as two white males age
18-22. One was 6 feet, 200 pounds with black hair, and
the other was 5 feet 10 inches, 150 pounds with a flat
top, Eison reported.

Mike Young, head of security, urges students to keep
their doors locked and report any suspicious people.

‘Students have got to be more aware of their own
security,’’ Young said.

Students often don’t lock doors because of the Honor
System, Young said, but other people enter W&L build-
ings all the time who have no concern for students’
property or the Honor System.

“The Honor System is wonderful for students who
live on campus, but people who don’t live here don’t
abide by it,’’ Young said.

Alex Cross, a freshman living in Baker Dorm said that
he never locked his door, but he said he will now.

‘Everyone is keeping their doors locked now,’’ Cross
said.

Bludworth said that no one on his hall locked their
doors because there was never any reason to.

‘“‘Now I lock my door every time I come out,’’ he
said.

The missing CDs have the letters ‘‘BLUD”’ written on
them, and some CDs were in a case.

Speaker urges ‘slow

Staff Reporter

This year marked the fifth year in a row
that a Washington and Lee woman captured
the Homecoming Honors.

On Oct. 12 senior Jodi Herring was
crowned Homecoming Queen. Herring
represented Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, and
was escorted by Joel Shinofield.

Herring is very involved in the W&L
community. She is captain of the cross-
country team, and is co-captain of the swim
team with Doug Brown. Herring is also a
second year dorm counselor. This year she
has the added responsibility of Assistant
Head Dorm Counselor.

It’s essentially ‘‘a 24-hour-a-day job”
said Herring. She also leads responsible
behavior seminars along with the crises that
occur on her 3rd floor Davis dormitory.

Herring said her job as assistant head
dorm counselor entails being a ‘‘link bet-
ween freshmen and the administration.”

When asked about winning the crown
Herring said she was ‘‘very surprised’’ and
was ‘‘really honored just to be nominated.”’

W&LiFE

_|Herring crowned queen |

After her nomination Herring received a
letter from Kathekon notifying her of a
‘*get-to-know-you”’ interview with the judg-
ing committee. Each nominee was inhter-
ge for approximately 5 minutes on Oct.

x

The judges were Charles F. Murray,
former director of Security; Robert J. de
Maria, Professor of Journalism and com-
munications; Barbara J. Brown, Professor
and University Librarian; Micheal A. Pleva,
professor of chemistry; and Christine L.
Davis, Campaign Events Coordinator,
Development.

Friday night each nominee and her escort
gathered at the alumni house for a reception
with alumni. Herring had the opportunity to
speak to many Five Star Generals as well as
hear stories of W&L days gone by.

Herring said she got the chance to tell
men who graduated before co-education
about ‘‘what it’s like to be a woman at
W&L.”’

After Saturday’s game there was another
alumni reception, which Herring attended as
Queen. The event capped off the official
festivities of what Herring called an ‘‘cxc
iting weekend.”’

Hunting season
will begin soon

Sophomore Jim Gilreath of

 

Last Wednesday, Mike Green, a former alcoholic who’s been sober for 14
years, delivered the keynote address in Lee Chapel for Washington and Lee's
annual Alcohol Awareness Week.

Green now tours college campuses lecturing on alcoholism. He urges
students to drink wisely so that they can continue to drink for the rest of their
lives.

Greenville, S.C. gets his shot-
gun ready for the quickly ap-
proaching season. Look for a
special feature on the opening
of fall hunting season in next
week's Phi.

“One of the biggest problems is that we don’t teach drinking,’ said Green.
He went on to list different types of drinkers: developed, controlled con-
sumption, social, negative, non-controlled, and dependent.

Green explained that developed drinkers never drink, and controlled con-
sumption drinkers get drunk only about five times a year. Green said that
social drinkers get drunk 6-25 times a year.

Green said that negative drinkers get drunk 26-100 times a year, and non-
controlled drinkers get drunk 100-150 times a year. Green said the most
abusive drinkers, or dependent drinkers, get drunk 200 or more times a year.

‘“‘Why would you want what I have? Would you really want to give up
your alcohol?’’ Green asked.

He said there is a happy medium between alcoholism and abstinence.
‘You can have your alcohol and not be an alcoholic,’’ Green said.
Green concluded, ‘‘Don’t stop [drinking], slow down!”

Students see by sea

 

From news release

 

Two Washington and Lee students
are traveling the world by sea this
fall.

Seniors Robert Chandler and Jeff
O’Brien left on their voyage from
Vancouver, British Columbia on Sept.
12;

Semester At Sea, administered by
the Institute for Shipboard Education
and academically sponsored by the
University of Pittsburgh, is a program
that takes about 500 students from
colleges and universities across the
Unites States and abroad, each fall
and spring semester. Students can
choose from 50 lower and upper
division courses in a variety of dis-
ciplines.

Courses offered are accredited by
the University of Pittsburgh and are
fully transferable to the students
home institution. Classes meet daily
while the ship is at sea. The faculty
consists of visiting professors from
‘nstitutions around the world.

When in port students can choose
from a wide range of structured tra-
vel opportunities that are developed
by the institute and the faculty. Stu-
dents can also travel independently.

Semester At Sea uses the S.S.
Universe, a ship equipped as a float-
ing university. It includes classrooms
with closed circuit television capabi-
lities, a library, theater, student union
and cafeteria. It also includes a
swimming pool, basketball and vol-
leyball court, and a weight room. A
student life staff provides activities
programming while the ship is at sea.

Chandler and O’Brien have recent-
ly visited Kobe, Japan and are cur-
rently sailing for Shanghai in the
People’s Republic of China.

They will also visit Taiwan, Ma-
laysia, India, Kenya, South Africa,
Brazil and Venezuela before they
dock in New Orleans on Dec. 22.

The University of Pittsburgh and
the Institute for Shipboard Education
provided the information for this

City to debate
zoning law

By Rick Peltz
Editor

 

 

A proposed change to city zoning laws might block
students from new housing opportunities and will be the
subject of an 8 p.m. public hearing at City Hall today.

Current law mandates that no more than four unrelated
people can live in a single family home. Exceptions to
the law are allowed with permits renewed annually.

One proposed amendment will forbid the issuing of
new permits, though owners with permits can continue
to apply for annual renewal.

Another proposal will reduce the number of unrelated
people allowed to live together from four to three.

On Nov. 1, 1990, the city council unanimously
imposed a one-year moratorium against issuing permits.

At that meeting, community leaders and Washington
and Lee students debated the issue.

Dorothy Cecil, president of the Rockbridge Area
Neighborhood League, urged passage of the moratorium
as well as a phase-out of existing large-capacity houses,
those protected by permits.

Cecil said there had been complaints about students in
all areas of Lexington.

A letter from Donald and Patricia M. Thomas of
Morningside Drive also supported the moratorium.

‘Each new student housing unit makes it increasingly
difficult for local residents to find affordable housing and
furthers the process of disruption and the eventual
destruction of this community,’’ the Thomases wrote.

Young discussed the access VMI
students have to W&L housing.

‘I was distressed to find that
VMI first-classmen are able to come
and go as they please on weekend
nights. If they are not legitimate
guests, however, they have no busi-
ness here,’’ said Young.

According to VMI Public Infor-
mation Officer Tom Joynes, junior
and sophomore cadets who are
granted weekend leave and do not
live in Rockbridge County are re-
quired to remain outside the county
until Sunday at 11 p.m. If the cadets
return early, they must to go to their
barracks.

VMI seniors may spend their
weekends in or outside of the county.

‘‘The problem, however, is that
these liberated students are trying to
stay overnight with our women in the
dorms,”’ said Young.

‘‘The cadets are welcome as long
as they are invited here, are in the
company of W&L students, if they
behave themselves and most impor-
tantly as long as they are within the
rules of VMI,’’ said Young.

Young stressed that W&L’s guest
policy applies to all visitors, not just

SURVEY

college women is raped annually,
according to an information sheet
provided by the dean of students
office.

According to the information
sheet, the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation projects that 25 percent of
college women will be the victim of
a rape of attempted rape during col-
lege.

More sexual assaults and rapes
occurred during the first months of
school than at other times during the
year, according to the survey results.

“It’s a combination of the early
Rush schedule; Homecoming and
freshmen not knowing their limits
with alcohof,’* Assdciate Dean of
Students and Counseling Psychologist
Anne Schroer-Lamont said.

Six women responding to the
survey reported being sexually as-
saulted by strangers before coming to
Washington and Lee, and eight said
they were raped before college. Three
reported being victims of incest.

Fifteen of the women who were
raped or sexually assaulted said al-
cohol was a factor in the incident.
Schroer-Lamont said when alcohol is
involved, people blame the victim and
the victim often blames herself.

‘‘Whenever alcohol is involved,
women become more judgmental of
each other,’’ Schroer-Lamont said.
‘*There’s not room for judgement in
these cases.”’

All together, 31 of last year’s
freshman woman reported being vic-
tims of sexual assault, rape or incest.

Schroer-Lamont said several women
were victims of more than one inci-
dent of sexual abuse.

Many women choose not to report
rapes or sexual assaults to the police
or W&L administration because they
are afraid they might be blamed for
the incident or they may be shunned
by friends, Schroer-Lamont said.

The Confidential Review Commit-
tee, which handles cases of sexual
assault or rape involving W&L stu-
dents, provides an alternative to re-
porting incidents to the police or not
reporting them at all.

However, Schroer-Lamont said the
CRC does not have a reputation for
confidentiality because of the way the
two cases they have adjudicated were
handled.

“With the first two cases, the
university was learning the system
through the cases,’’ Schroer-Lamont
said.

‘The first two were not very con-
fidential, because of people talking
about the cases. I think if there had
been more cases, then the CRC
would have a different reputation.”’

The worst thing a sexual assault
or rape victim can do is try to forget
the whole incident, Schroer-Lamont
said.

‘“T just want to put it behind me’
is one of the worst things a woman
can say,’’ Schroer-Lamont said.

“Until she deals with the incident
in counseling, it will just crop up in
some other way,’’ Schroer-Lamont
said.

with optimism.

“Our whole bench thought we
were going to win the game,”’ said
Fallon. ‘‘We got the onside kick, but
then we had a miss in communica-
tions.’’

Needing just over 25 yards and
out of timeouts, Fallon called for
Steiner to try to hit Kreis with a
deep pass. Kreis cut one way, and
Steiner’s pass went another and was
intercepted, and Davidson held on for
the win.

“T hadn’t worked with Jeff long
enough to know that if he saw his
route was covered that he’d break it
off,”’ said Steiner. ‘‘It was painful to
lose that way, but it was a good
feeling to play that tough anyway.”’

Steiner hit 10 of 16 passes for
153 yards and two touchdowns, the
, best day by a W&L quarterback this
year. Seven different Generals caught
at least one pass. Kreis led the way
with three catches for 54 yards and
one touchdown.

Defensively, the Generals were led

by senior John McCallum who regist-

ered 18 tackles and a sack on the
day. Senior Scott Williamson and
Smith each had 12 tackles. Smith
now has 93 tackles through five
games.

Though the loss dropped the Gen-
erals to 0-5 on the season, Fallon
said you wouldn’t know the team was
0-5 from looking at them.

‘I’m encouraged with the way we
came back,’’ he said. ‘‘I like the
style in which we did it. The kids are
playing their fannies off. They aren’t
playing like they are 0-5. They
weren’t off the field yet Saturday
before they were thinking about
Hampden-Sydney. They’re fired up
about the game, and that’s what it’s
all about.”’

The Generals will play the Tigers
at 1:30 Saturday in Hampden-
Sydney, Va. The Tigers are 2-2-1
overall and 1-2 in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference. They average 27
points a game offensively, but yield
almost 26.

It’s not if you win or
lose, but how you play...

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

It may be one of the biggest cliches in the book, and one I’m sure you
heard when you were growing up, but now more than ever, it can be
applied right here at Washington and Lee. It’s not whether you win or
lose, it’s how you play the game.

Washington and Lee is an NCAA Division III institution and is one
of the top academic schools in the nation. W&L does not offer athletic
scholarships, and it is a frequent — and almost required occurrence — to
see athletes miss practice and the occasional game due to academic
responsibilities.

This is not Southern Methodist University, where the alumni reward(ed)
football players with substantial amounts of money. This is not Ferrum,
where a student-athlete is more the athlete — especially during football
season — and almost not a student. This is Washington and Lee, where
it is an unchallenged truth that academics comes before athletics.

And at W&L this fall, our football team is struggling. It is winless in
its first five games. But, if ever there was an instance to apply the cliche,
this is it. Aside from the academic responsibilities of his players, head
coach Gary Fallon has had his work cut out for him.

He was perhaps the hardest hit coach by 1991's graduation. On
offense, seven starters did not return to the team, including four offensive
linemen, the school’s second all-time leading receiver, and the school’s
fifth leading rusher and third leading scorer. On this year’s offense, only
three players are starting where they started last year. One moved over
from defense, one changed positions on the line, and one moved from
quarterback to split end. This team may be the most inexperienced team
Fallon has coached.

Last week against Davidson, for various reasons, Fallon’s team had
nine freshmen play a majority of the minutes.

So look more at the way the team is handling itself on the field rather
than at the scoreboard. Last week’s game with Davidson showed that the
team has far from thrown in the towel. They continue to work hard, as
Fallon says, harder than you might expect an 0-5 team to work.

And remember one thing, they aren’t here to play football. They play
because they love the game. And despite the losing, they are still working
hard. ‘‘They are fired up about the game, and that’s what it’s all about.”’

Sooner or later, the hard work will pay off and the team will get that
first win. So don’t get down on them because they haven’t won. They’re
working hard and having fun, and at this level, while winning is nice, it’s
more about how you play the game.

 

 

 

 

 

Volleyball tops Macon
Hess nearing record

 

From Staff Reports

 

Junior Leslie Hess is approaching

The Washington and Lee volley-
ball team picked up a key Old Dom-
inion Athletic Conference win Friday
night, but lost two other matches
during the week.

W&L dropped Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College 15-9, 15-8, 15-12
on Friday night to earn its second
ODAC win of the season. On Satur-
day, W&L fell to Goshen of Indiana
in three games.

During the week, though, the Gen-
erals got off slowly against Roanoke
before losing in four games to the
Maroons in Salem. The loss left the
Generals 8-12 on the season and 2-
3 in the ODAC.

This week is a crucial one for the
Generals as they jockey for position
in the ODAC standings. W&L faced
Bridgewater Wednesday night and
will play Lynchburg tonight in the
Warner Center.

Over the weekend, the Generals

Lynchburg
in upset

“Sweet victory.”

That’s all that Washington and
Lee men’s cross country coach John
Tucker could say as he savored the
stunning upset his Generals pulled off
in Washington, D.C.

W&L faced host Catholic Univer-
sity at the meet, as well as Lynch-
burg College, the top team in the
Division III Southeast Region. Make
that the former top team in the
region.

Lynchburg came into the meet
undefeated and fully expected to
leave that way. But that was not to
be the case.

Carried by the outstanding perfor-
mance of W&L’s tandem of Bo
Hannah and Charles Edwards, the
Generals easily outdistanced Catholic
18-37, but barely out-pointed LC 27-
28.

Tucker said the race was “‘thri-
lling from a spectator’s perspective,’’
although for him it was a nail-biter.

 

 

 

 

Bo Hannah
..has led W&L In each race

Showing that his early season
success is no fluke, Hannah ran neck
and neck with LC’s all-american
Greg Cavaliere. In a personal duel
throughout the race, Hannah forged
ahead by the slightest margin as the
finish came into view, but he was
outsprinted to the line.

Hannah’s finish of 26:24 was just
four seconds off the pace. Edwards,
with a fourth place overall finish in
26:56, is beginning to approach peak
form as he ran his best race of the
season to date.

But, Tucker was quick to point
out that Hannah and Edwards are not
a two-man team. ‘We could not have
won without the tremendous showings
from our third, fourth , and fifth
runners,’’ he said.

Keith Rinn, Matthew Brock, and
Lee Parker, respectively, all finished
ahead of LC’s fourth runner. Rinn
led the trio with a personal record
time of 27:54. Close behind with the
finishes that insured the victory were
Brock at 28:05 and tri-captain Parker
at 28:21.

“Tt was a satisfying win and
confidence booster,’ said Tucker.
“The guys are pumped up and
focused [for next week’s meet]."’

On Saturday, the Generals run in
the Virginia State meet. W&L will
run against the Division II and III
schools in the state, including a re-
match with Lynchburg.

There comes a point in every
team’s season when they face a mo-
ment of truth: one play, one quarter,
one half that becomes a catapult to a
higher level of play.

For the Washington and Lee
men’s soccer team, that moment of
truth was the second half of Satur-
day’s 2-1 victory over Greensboro.
And by the look of the team during
Wednesday’s win over Old Dominion
Athletic Conference foe Eastern Men-
nonite, 4-1, the team has been cata-
pulted to a higher level of play.

Prior to the Greensboro game, the
Generals had lost three of their last
four games and it looked like their
impressive beginning was all for
naught. The first half of the Greens-
boro game lent itself to this thinking
as well.

A give-away on a goal kick led to
the first Greensboro score, and it was
the type of play that takes the wind

ghts ship

out of some teams’ sails.

However, after the goal the Gen-
erals began to play sharper soccer.
They put the clamps on Greensboro
and allowed them only one good
chance the rest of the game.

“It was pretty nice [the defensive
play],’’ said head coach Rolf Pir-
anian. ‘‘The first half was spotty and
sloppy. The second half, though, was
one of the best halves of soccer this
year.”’

The Generals came out in the
second half and played inspired soc-
cer. This type of play paid off mid-
way through when senior tri-captain
Jeff Zieger scored his first goal of
the season, It tied the score at one,
the goal also ended a scoring drought
which had reached five halves.

But the play of the game, the
game-winning goal, signaled a new
attitude for the Generals. Bobby
Weisgerber sprinted 20 yards to save
the ball from going out of bounds,
then turned down the sideline, beat
his defender, and laid a beautiful

On a day when many who had
played Washington and Lee football
in the past were in attendance, those
quite new to W&L football gave
them quite a show.

With former All-American split
end Craig Irons looking on, there was
freshman William Propst making a
diving catch at the Davidson five-
yard line with just over one minute
left.

With W&L’s leading rusher from
the past three seasons Mason Pope
looking on, there was freshman runn-
ing back Michael MacLane catching
a 12-yard touchdown pass for the
Generals first score.

And with all the former stars in
attendance, freshman quarterback
Geren Steiner stole the show.

Entering the game with W&L
trailing 16-0 late in the third quarter
when starting quarterback Fred Ren-
neker went down with an ankle in-
jury, Steiner rallied the Generals, with
a kick start from Davidson.

After sacking Steiner on his first
two plays to set up a fourth down
and 54 at the W&L 18, Davidson
committed the biggest faux-pas in
football. They ran into W&L punter

Bob Ehret, giving the Generals a first
down.

Given new life, Steiner took over.
He marched the Generals 67 yards in
12 plays, hitting tight end Wilson
Moore for a gain of 16, fullback
Mark Goglia for a gain of 12 and
then MacLane for the final 12 and
the score. The two-point conversion
failed, and Davidson led 16-6.

Steiner said he wasn’t that ner-
vous being forced into action. ‘‘I
didn’t know I was going to play.
Everything happened so quick that I
really didn’t have time to get ner-
vous,”’ he said.

“The roughing the kicker was a
big break for us,’’ said head coach
Gary Fallon. ‘‘It gave us some mo-
mentum back and got our defense
some valuable rest. The offense was
on the field for 26 straight plays and
came away with a score.”’

W&L’s well-rested defense then
gave the offense the ball back when
junior Lyle Smith recovered a David-
son fumble. Davidson got the ball
back, though, when the offense came
up short on fourth down.

“I have to admire our kids,’’ said
Fallon. ‘‘When we missed the first
two-point conversion, they could have
thrown in the towel, but they didn’t.
Then we give the ball back to them,
force a fourth down, and they fake a

with two wins

crossing pass in front of the goal,
where Reid Murphy deftly directed
the ball into the lower comer of the
goal for the winner.

“Emotionally, it [the Greensboro
win] was the turing point,’’ said
keeper Mike Steinbrook. ‘‘The at-
titude of the team has definitely
changed. Now we have to keep the
intensity level high.’’

“Tt was an inspiring half of soc-
cer,’ a pleased Piranian said.
‘*Things weren’t looking too good in
the first half. It was a good win.”’

However, the victory would have
been empty if the Generals hadn't
solidified it by beating Eastern Men-
nonite on Wednesday. And they won
emphatically.

Freshman Sam Drennan opened
the scoring late in the first half when
EMC’s goalie left a rebound out. in
front of the goal. The Royals came
back to tie the game early in the
second half, but that was it.

Junior Michael Hill scored the
next two goals within three minutes

of each other to give the Generals a
3-1 lead. Again, both goals came as
a result of the keeper leaving re-
bounds out in front of the goal. Mur-
phy closed out the scoring with his
team-leading fifth goal on a penalty
kick late in the game.

“It’s nice to have a big win with
a lot of goals,’’ said Weisgerber after
the Eastern Mennonite win. ‘‘We’re
having a good time now. Players and
coaches are in a good mood. We
have a new motto, every time we’re
out there it’s ‘a great college soccer
practice.’ It’s just fun to be out
there.’’

The two victories upped the Gen-
erals’ mark to 6-3-2, 3-2-0 in the
ODAC. The ODAC win total matches
that of last year’s team with two
games to go. Saturday, the Generals
take the trip to Va. Beach to play
powerhouse Virginia Wesleyan.

The following Saturday, the Gen-
erals play their final game before the
ODAC Tournament at Lynchburg.

The Washington and Lee water
polo team traveled to Rhode Island
this past weekend with revenge on its
mind,

Though W&L faced tough
matches against the University of
Massachusetts, Army, and Villanova
the Generals were determined to
avenge two early-season losses to
Richmond.

According to W&L head coach
Page Remillard, the EPWA allowed
the Generals strong bench play to
shine despite losses to UMass, 6-5
and Army 16-12.

In the opening match against
1Sth-ranked UMass, the W&L de-
fense was characteristically stingy as
sophomores Greg Golub and Jake
Berman contributed five steals apiece
while goalies P.J. Waicus and
Michael Flippen combined for six
blocks. The scoring load fell on the
shoulders of seniors Will Davis and

John Kannapell, who scored two
goals each. Alan Herrick, another
senior, added the other goal.

W&L had its chances offensively,
but could not capitalize on seven
man-up scoring opportunities doomed
their chances for victory and wasted
the defensive effort.

Against Villanova, the W&L
offense exploded in a 14-12 double
overtime win receiving five goals
apiece from Davis and Herrick. Des-
pite the high offensive production,
Remillard felt the close game with
U.Mass caused the Generals’ perfor-
mance to be lackluster at best.

‘*We were still feeling the effects
of the previous game,’’ he said, ‘‘but
we showed we have the ability to
come from behind to win a match.’’

After trailing early in the first
half, W&L rallied to take an 8-7
halftime lead. In the third and fourth
quarters both teams played even until
the second overtime when W&L
outscored their opponent 2-1 to se-
cure the victory.

tournament In Providence, R.I., Herrick scored eight goals in two
wins, Including the game-winner in overtime against Villanova.

Polo gets revenge against Richmond

Against Army, the emotional drain
of two close games appeared to have
caught up with the Generals, Similar
problems that plagued W&L in the
UMass game cropped up again in
their 16-12 loss. The Generals offense
was only able to take advantage of
four of seven man-up scoring oppor-
tunities, while Army hit on three
goals on four attempts. Though W&L
was clearly outplayed by Army, Rem-
illard felt that with work the team
could be just as good if not better
than Army.

Despite Remillard’s confidence
after the Army game, frustration
plagued the Generals in the first half
of their final game with Richmond.
After falling behind 5-0 in the first
half it appeared as if the Generals
were headed for their third straight
defeat at the hands of the Spiders,

‘After falling behind 5-0, we
called the team together and dis-
banded with any strategy and went
back to the basics,’’ Remillard said.

Apparently, the tactic worked as
the Generals outscored the Spiders

12-4 in the final three quarters to win
12-9. Though W&L suffered prob-
lems early, excellent play by the
bench was one of the main reasons
for the team’s come from behind
victory.

“Our bench players have im-
proved more than Richmond's bench
players and the starting lineup is
confident that they can come into a
game and preserve leads,’’ Remillard
said.

Though Remillard is pleased with
bench performance, he hopes that the
play of the goalies will become more
aggressive.

‘Our goalies must compete better
to deny opponents from scoring,’’ he
said. ‘*We still have the best goalies
in terms of talent but they need to
find the desire to be the best they
can be.”’

W&L, 9-7 on the season, will
take a break from game action. Next
up for the Generals is the Southern
Conference Tournament to be held at
Twombly Pool in three weeks.

punt and get a first down. And our,
kids still don’t throw the towel in.”

W&L didn’t give up, they buckled’
down and forced the Wildcats to punt,
again, this time getting the ball at
their own 25 with 2:32 left.

Immediately, W&L went on the,
attack. Steiner hit senior Jeff Kreis
for a gain of 32 on the second play.’

Steiner said that once the offense
got going, confidence just kept build-’
ing. ’
“The play to Jeff let everyone,
know that we were still in the
game,’’ he said. ‘‘But the biggest,
play was the one after that. William
made a great catch.”’

Two plays later, Steiner hit the,
diving Propst for 39 yards, setting up
a nine-yard scoring pass from Steiner ‘
to Kreis. On the play, Steiner bob- ,
bled the snap but was still able to
recover and hit Kreis for the touch- ;
down.

Down by four with 51 seconds’
left, Steiner took care of the two-,
point conversion himself, running for
the score after his receivers were '
covered. ;

covered an onside kick. When senior :

ball, the Generals were overflowing '

History unofficially repeated itself

last week when the Washington and ’
Lee women’s soccer team ended ,

regulation play with a 0-0 tie at

Roanoke Thursday, and then lost 1- ‘

0 in an off-the-record overtime. ;

Sunday’s home game against

national power Emory was also a tie, ‘

1-1 after two overtimes.
Head coach Janine Hathorn was

very pleased with the tumout. :

“To tie Emory is like a win for
us. They needed to beat us, and the
tie is a huge accomplishment for this
program that is only five years old,”
she said.

Hathorn was pleased with the
performance of sophomo-e goalie
Kate Stimeling, who had 13 saves in
the Emory contest.

She also commended the play of
senior Ashley Hurt and sophomore

Aspen Yawars, who scored the lone ,

goal against Emory, commenting that
they both have been ‘‘incredible’’ in
the past two games.

“‘We played a very good team in
Emory. What we needed for that
game was something I wasn’t sure
we had,’ Hathorn said. ‘‘But we
played a whole new level of soccer
that we have never been tmily able to
keep up with before.”’

,

’

‘

‘

She was also pleased with the *

team’s performance at Roanoke.

“The Roanoke game was the first
year that we just played even with
them the whole game,’ she said.
“*We were just as good as they were
in every respect, and that was a giant
step.”’

The Generals, now 4-1-1 in the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
and 4-3-2 overall, met Hollins Wed-
nesday in an away game.

“If we get complacent and think
that Hollins is not a tough team, and

play down to their level, we could ”
walk away with a scary near win or ,

even a loss,’’ the coach said.

She need not have worried. After
a scoreless first half, the Generals
scored twice in the second half for a
2-0 win. Sophomores Angie Car-
rington and Corinda Hankins scored
the goals, and Stimeling registered
her 14th career shutout. She made
just two saves as the Generals out-
shot Hollins 23-2.

Hathom, though, is still worried
about W&L’s lack of offense.

“Once we can start putting the
ball in the goal a little more often,
that’s really the last thing we need to
work on,”’ she said.

Offense is the expertise of first-
year assistant coach Shari Krasnoo.

‘The players need to fill the goal
with the ball in response to what she

has taught them,’’ Hathorn
“‘Shari’s done a great job.’’

tunity to score against Methodist

Rush begins
for women

_ 106 freshmen sign up Friday

 

By Jennifer Mayo
Staff Reporter

 

More than 200 women attended
the women’s Greek Rally Friday to
welcome Pi Beta Phi as W&L’s
fourth sorority.

Freshmen and upperclass women
were encouraged to attend the rally to
hear Pi Beta Phi’s presentation about
their national sorority and their hopes
for the colony here at Washington
and Lee.

Panhellenic Rush Chairman Bran-
non Aden told PHC that 109 women
signed up to rush in January, and 106
of the women were freshmen.

‘‘We would like to see more up-
perclass women register to rush,”
PHC President Dale Wyatt told the
council Tuesday night. ‘‘There is a
great opportunity for them even in a
new group to become leaders.’’

Pi Beta Phi will be rushing in
January with W&L’s three existing

sororities, Chi Omega, Kappa Kappa
Gamma, and Kappa Alpha Theta.
Active members of these groups also
attended the rally to show their sup-

W&L PHC has been helpful in incor-
porating the new group.

“Dale Wyatt and Panhellenic have
been helping us tremendously, and I
am happy with our working relation-
ship,’’ Lesh said.

Lesh also said the quota adjust-
ment, which will allow Pi Beta Phi
to get 50 percent of the rushees while
the other three groups each get 16
percent, will help to assure a strong
colony.

By Cathy Lopiccolo
News Editor

 

W&L administrators are searching for ways to
improve the campus security system and make
students more responsible for their personal safety.

Dean of Students David Howison said a review
of the campus security system has been going on
since August, when Michael Young took over as
the new director of security.

During the time Young has been conducting the
review, four women have reported being raped or
sexually assaulted near campus.

In the most recent incident, a Washington and
Lee freshman reported being raped by a Virginia
Military Institute cadet in her Gilliam dormitory
room. The cadet was able to enter the woman’s
room while she slept because she had left her door
unlocked, Lexington police said.

Young said he has begun evaluating the se-
curity systems in several buildings and that the

Computer
to help
collect tax

A computer system scheduled for
installation next month will allow
Lexington’s treasury to more easily
collect the car tax.

The City Council appropriated
about $5,000 at its Oct. 3 meeting to
bring the tax department on-line with
the computerized registration records
from the Virginia Department of
Motor Vehicles.

‘This is a very crucial tool for us
to levy a personal property tax,’’ City

Since he has begun his evaluation, Young said
he has recommended additional lighting between
the University Library and Woods Creek Apart-
ments, which has already been installed. He said
other lighting around campus is adequate, in his
opinion.

In addition, Young and Howison said they are
looking into installing more emergency phones on
campus. Young said there are already four emer-
gency phones on campus, but they are in remote
areas and are not well-marked. He said there are
phones at the Pavillion, near the football stadium,
by the Military Science Building, and in the
freshman parking lot. :

“Right now, it’s difficult for people to find [the
emergency phones], and students need to know
where they are,’’ Young said.

Students on campus are also finding ways to
protect each other. Howison said junior Andrew
Tucker and senior Jay Gabbard have proposed an
escort service in which students walk other students

 

Administrators stressed, however, that in order
for any security system to work, students must take
some personal responsibility for their safety.

‘‘There’s not enough money in the world to
hire a personal bodyguard for every student on
campus,’’ Associate Dean of Students Leroy C.
‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins said.

Associate Dean of Students for Freshmen and
Residence Life Dennis Manning and Howison said
the Honor System may be part of the reason
students don’t think they need to lock their doors.

‘The Honor System lulls us into a false sense
of security,’ Manning said. ‘You can still promote
the Honor System and be vigilant about your safety
and your other dormmates.”*”

Howison, Atkins and Young said they also
consider alcohol to be a major problem in safety.

‘‘People are not as likely to practice good
security when they’re intoxicated,’’ Young said.
“I’ve been surprised at the number of people who
walk around at night in a state of intoxication.’’

Rape suspect faces new
charge of grand larceny

 

By Thomas Eisenhauer
Staff Reporter

 

Chad Hudnall, the former VMI
cadet accused of raping a W&L
woman Oct. 13, has been charged
with stealing $354 from another
W&L woman the same night.

Hudnall, 18, who is being held in
Rockbridge Regional Jail, was charg-
ed with one count of grand larceny
and one count of breaking and enter-
ing with the intent to commit larceny.

He was also charged with one

count of felony breaking and entering
with the intent to commit rape and
one count of intent to commit rape.
He already faced charges of rape and
sodomy.

Lexington Chief of Police Bruce
Beard said Hudnall entered the room
of Christin Harvey, '93, and stole
about $600 from a purse in her
dresser. Police recovered $354.

At the time of the incident on
Oct. 13, Hudnall was free on $6,000
bond stemming from indictments in
Newport News, Va., on burglary and
grand larceny.

 

 

Manager T. Jon Ellestad said.
Lexington currently levies a per-
sonal property tax on cars of $4.25
per $100 of the vehicle’s assessed
value. The city’s attempts to collect
the tax from students at Washington
and Lee were met with outrage from

, students last year.

In response to the protests, the
city council agreed to ‘‘pro-rate’’ the
car tax, not requiring students to pay
for the months the car is not kept in
Lexington.

Commissioner of Revenue Court-
ney Baker said the new system was
necessary to pro-rate the tax,

‘We are entitled access to the
information,’’ Baker said. ‘‘l am now
studying ways to pro-rate the tax at
the request of the City Council.’’

Until recently, the city obtained
registration information from a similar
computer system used by police. But
the state police told Lexington in
August that sharing such information
was inappropriate, Ellestad said.

The DMV records also give the
social security numbers of tax of-
fenders, Ellestad said.

Lexington City Council approved
site plans for the new Sigma Chi and
Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity houses
in Davidson Park, despite debate over
the visibility of a basketball court.

University Coordinator of Capital

sured the city planning commission
that Washington and Lee will add
trees along Nelson Street if noise
becomes a problem.

But at the Oct. 17 council meet-
ing, the city was more concerned
about shielding from Nelson Street
the basketball court that will run
along the proposed houses’ courtyard.

Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins, as-
sociate dean of students for Greek

affairs, said he would like the court
to be visible so community residents
can see fraternity members playing
sports, rather than ‘‘standing around
with a beer.’’

Mayor H.E. ‘‘Buddy’’ Derrick
suggested W&L build a low, grassy
hill along the court to obscure it from
sight. Parsons agreed to consider that
option, but said he is not qualified to
say if it will work.

City amends zoning law to limit student housing

 

By Rick Peltz
Editor

 

Lexington City Council passed a measure on
Oct. 17 intended to discourage investors from
buying city housing to rent to students.

The city hopes the changes in law will leave
more housing on the market for low-income
families,

One of the zoning law amendments removes
the council’s power to issue permits allowing
more than three unrelated people to live toge-

ther in a single family home. Existing permits
can be renewed.

Another amendment reduces the number of
unrelated people who can live together from
four to three. Homes with four unrelated people
cohabitating now must register with the city
within six months.

At a public hearing before the council
meeting, The Rev. James Harris of First Baptist
Church on Main Street was the first citizen to
speak on the zoning amendments.

“With the completion of the fraternity
houses, there should now be enough room to

house students,’’ Harris said. ‘‘The citizens who
provide long-term support for Lexington should
be rewarded with affordable housing.”’

Lexington resident Paul Penick disagreed
with the amendments, questioning the council’s
legal ground to pass them.

Penick said since married people are con-
sidered related, the zoning law discriminates
against unmarried people living together.

City Manager T. Jon Ellestad said he had
never worked for a district without zoning laws
that did not distinguish unmarried from married
people.

No students spoke at the hearing.

Associate Dean of Student for Greek Affairs
Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins spoke at the hearing,
but said he represented himself, not Washing-
ton and Lee,

‘“My fear is that if you reduce the number
of people you keep pushing available housing
down and create economic competition for the
affordable, entry-level housing,’’ Atkins said,

Mayor H.E. ‘‘Buddy’’ Derrick said vacan
cies in the city are abundant, so he does not
believe the situation Atkins described will
occur,

Campus in crisis:
ideas for the Hill

As was noted here a week ago, action to stem the
rising tide of violence at our university must be taken.
The reports of rapes have shocked us all, and the violence
and dangerous mayhem at fraternity parties, while par for
the course, are still appalling.

There are three courses that can be taken at this point.
Students and administrators can take the attitude that
there’s nothing that can be done, that things will always
be the way they are. This option is unlikely. Another
option is for students to think it is up to the
administration to change their policies to protect everyone
while at the same time administrators decide it’s up to the
students to change their attitudes and habits. This option is
frightening, and it’s entirely too possible. Obviously the
best option is for students and administrators to work
together to solve the problems that have been displayed in
new and shocking ways in the past months.

We don’t profess to have all the answers to the
problems; it will take everyone working together to
change things. As reported elsewhere in this issue, certain
members of the administration have begun planning new
programs to try to educate and protect students. We
applaud their actions and call for others to join them. This
week, we have two suggestions of our own for the
administration:

First, the admissions office must stop lying to high
schoolers. They insist on telling prospective freshmen that
Lexington is a safe haven from the rest of the world.
This week we have heard tour guides telling parents that
their children won’t ever have to lock their doors in the
dorms because everyone trusts each other here. We
understand that the safety of little Lexington is one of the
major drawing points for the university, but crime does
happen here. The admissions office practice of showing
the community through rose-colored glasses only serves to
lower a student’s guard and make him or her more
susceptible to the crime that does occur.

Julia Kozak, associate director of admissions and
coordinator of the Student Recruitment Committee, said
there is no policy on what tour guides tell prospectives
about security at W&L. She said she’ll suggest that they
tone down the rhetoric about trust and safety, but she
won’t be able to do it until next term because that’s when
their next meeting is scheduled. It shouldn’t be too much
trouble for Mrs. Kozak to call a meeting now and stop
tour guides from misleading high school students and their
parents in order to stop next year’s freshmen’ from’ putting
themselves at risk.

Second, while a number of different deans have gone
to great pains to inform members of this staff that alcohol
is a primary factor in most cases of assault (sexual or
other) on this campus, we suggest that they expend their
energy on informing the rest of the students of their
findings. Alcohol was not mentioned as a factor in either
of the two memos that Dean Howison issued to the
student body after the three recent reports of sexual
assault on campus.

The fact is, alcohol was a factor in all three cases.
Unfortunately, if a woman who is sexually assaulted says
she was drunk at the time, many people will lose
sympathy for her and believe she got what she asked for.
If the reason behind the administration’s lack of full
disclosure is to protect the feelings of the victim, it is
understandable, but still a mistake. The greater good must
be looked to. Only if other students know that some
people will take advantage of them when their defenses
are down, will they think ahead and avoid such situations.
Warning freshmen during hall meeting circle sharing about
the dangers of alcohol is not nearly as effective as telling
them that students have been raped and injured and that
alcohol played a part in the violence.

Next week, at the risk of preaching a sermon, we will
end our three-part editorial with some suggestions for the
student body. Our aim, as always in this column, is to
encourage everyone to make Washington and Lee as good
as we all know it can be.

Wé&L’s problem.

MY VIEW
By Katherine Walther

 

 

It’s pretty easy to blame the administration for the
lack of enthusiasm concerning Alcohol Awareness Month.’
But, considering that I can’t remember the last time |,
saw Dean Howison doing a beer bong or President Wil-
son taking shots, I really don’t think the administration’
has a problem. I do, however, think that the student body,
has a problem.

What could the administration say or do that wouldn’t’
reach deaf ears? They can’t make speeches like Mr. Gre-,
en’s mandatory. They can’t force students to stop drink-
ing. Everything they do to try to ‘‘tone things down’’ is!
met with anger and resentment.

It is time the W&L community stopped blaming ev-
eryone else for its own problem. We are the ones who’

sit in the Co-op and brag about getting wasted. We leave,
tests and say ‘‘I’m going to go get hammered.’’ We are
the ones who choose not to party without alcohol. What’
has alcohol accomplished for our school? We have DUIs,

hospital injuries, alcoholism, incidents of rape, and even
deaths. What else do we need to force us to face our;
problem?

While it is a problem of the W&L community, it'
must be solved on a personal level. I ask that all people,
reading this article think about their own drinking habits.
You don’t need a survey to tell you if you have a drink-’
ing problem.

I personally sat down in a state of shock after the
events of the past few weeks as I realized that I was!
afraid to go out and drink because of what could happen |
to me. I began thinking about my own drinking habits. ‘
As a freshmen I thought I would never drink. Four years :
later, I find that do. Sometimes I drink responsibly, and
sometimes irresponsibly.

Here are some ideas which I began to ponder: Why ,
do we congratulate each other for getting ‘‘butt-wasted’’?
We should not brag; we should be embarrassed. Why do
we need to be nearly inebriated to enjoy a party? Are ,
our parties really that unbearable? Why can’t we have a.
good time being sober? Many of us don’t even try. ‘

_ Perhaps we don’t because many of us think that
parties like the freshmen icebreaker games and mixers’
were immature. ‘‘You aren’t cool unless you’re drink- :

”

was the implication. Well, I want to congratulate

the freshmen because they have a hell of a lot more’
courage than some of the upperclassmen. It does take ,
backbone to talk to people when you are sober. It does
take courage to kiss someone. It does take nerve to be’
answerable to your activities the next day rather than ,
saying ‘‘I was really drunk.’’

Freshmen year I wanted to cry out ‘‘What are we |
doing to ourselves and each other? People are being j
killed.’’ But I thought I was an oddball. I’m not. We do
have a problem. As a collective whole we have a‘
problem with alcohol, and it will take courage to solve it. -

Meaning depends on interpretation :

Cartoon did not show | a Tack of judgement, did not deal with harassment issue . . ’

 

MY VIEW
By J. MacGregor Tisdale

 

I am writing in response to a letter to the
Editor which appeared in your October 17 issue.
The subject in question is Timothy Molloy’s
political cartoon portraying Ms. Anita Hill, publish-
ed October 10. In the above mentioned letter, the
author questions the ‘‘good sense and taste, not to
mention fact’’ of the cartoon and accuses Mr.
Molloy of belittling the charges that were placed
before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The author
also believes that the editors of your paper demon-
strate a ‘‘lack of good judgement’’ for letting the
cartoon go to press. I would like to address the
author’s points separately.

The first issue of whether the cartoon represents
taste, good sense, and judgement is subjective, that
is, it is different depending on the individual.
Anyone who has studied Political Action Commit-
tees knows that their mere existence is controver-
sial both historically (James Madison expressed his
disapproval for such factions in The Federalist
Papers) and currently. The actions of PACs (some

Religious fundamentalism and the Braves:

of which opposed the nomination of Judge Clar-
ence Thomas on the basis of abortion and civil
rights) are also suspect. In my interpretation of
the cartoon in question, the suitcase full of money
represents possible foul play involving PACs. The

 

Little was accomplished in
determining Judge Thomas’
ability to interpret the law.
Personal lives and family
background have relatively
little to do with such ability.

inclusion of Senator Kennedy’s name simply ques-
tions the credibility of the Judiciary Committee
membership. Thank goodness Mr. Molloy had the
‘‘good sense’’ to bring out this point. The cartoon
might not be based on fact but it is the cartoonists
prerogative to speculate on issues if he so chooses.

The author believes that Mr. Molloy belittled
‘‘the serious charges’’ of sexual harassment. He
did not belittle the issue but instead placed this
delicate and difficult issue aside for others. The

 

main’ one being’ the process at which’ thé he,
mittee handled the nomination hearings. Little was’
accomplished i in determining Judge Thomas’ ability »
to interpret the law. Personal lives and family |
background have relatively little to do with such ’
ability. For example, Justice Oliver Wendell Hol- »
mes is considered by many to be the best ever to,
sit on the Supreme Court. His aristocratic back-’
ground and conservative idealogy had little to do
with his liberal voting record.

Finally, the author questioned The Ring-tum '
Phi’s professionalism and judgement i in publishing /
the cartoon. A political cartoon is a device used by |
the cartoonist to express his personal opinions. The '
opinion in the cartoon was that of Mr. Molloy’s, ;
not the newspaper. Any editorial page has several
instruments of political expression including edit- '
orials, cartoons, and letters to the editor. The,
author of the letter in question and Mr. Molloy |
each used one of these devices. Mr. Kelley and ’
Mr. Peltz have allowed all opinions to be voiced, ,
hereby maintaining their professionalism. My single |
hope is that the author, being a member of the’
American Civil Liberties Union, was not disputing ;
Mr. Molloy’s right to civil liberties,

?

LET IT RIDE
By Chris Swann

 

The religions of the world are the ejaculations
of a few imaginative men.

— Ralph Waldo Emerson

Ever wonder how people choose their religious
affectations? You know, why Catholic instead of
Protestant, Muslim instead of Jew, deist versus
atheist. I know all types, including a sect I call
‘‘Nature Buddhists’ (according to this religion,
we're all like flowers: we grow, and then we die),
and most people don’t know why they’re what they
are, except that their parents were ‘‘brand X’’ and
so they are, too. Kind of a random determination
on the state of your eternal soul, isn’t it?

Now a humor columnist doesn’t have the
authority to judge religious institutions that have
been in place for hundreds of years (then again,
Ted Kennedy has no place in being on an ethics
committee), but upon examining humans meddling
with the Divine, I get a queasy feeling in the pit
of my stomach. Man has severly botched religion,
Christianity especially. Popes have excommunicated
men for disagreeing with them on religious dogma.
Now that seems a touch severe, don’t you think?

Pope — ‘‘So, you don’t like our little
communion wafers, do you?’’ (As he applies
burning coals to a nonconformist’s feet.)

And how about the Inquisition? ‘‘Agree to our
lies so we can burn you in the name of God, or
suffer the rack.’’ How twisted is that? What would
you do if your teachers employed this little trick?

Unnamed English professor - ‘‘Say _ it!
*‘Milton’s Paradise Lost is the greatest poetic work
of English literature!’ ’’

Long-Suffering English major —
Never!”’

Malignant Man of Letters — ‘‘Have it your
way, fool.’’ (Three turns of the rack and howls of

‘No! No!

pain are heard emanating from Payne Hall.)

Didn’t these people ever hear of negative
reinforcement? I'd love to worship the god of a
sadistic torturer, honest.

While cruel and unusual punishment is not in
great evidence among the various denominations of
today’s Church, they sometimes seem little better.
Take televangelists. Remember when Pat Robertson

 

They all say that God rested
on the seventh day after
creating the universe. Does
the omnipotent God get
tired?

ran for President? He honestly believes God speaks
to him (not that Moses had an exclusive interview
with the Almighty, but give me a break), Could
you imagine what his administration would be like?

Financial Advisers — ‘‘Mr. President, the
homeless are asking for economic aid. They'll
starve next winter if they don’t get it. What should
we do?’’

President Robertson — ‘‘Gentlemen, God came
to me in a vision last night, yea and the waters of
Babylon flowed and the firmament shook, and, in
the most beautiful words I have ever heard uttered,
He said I should let the bastards hang.”’

Religion is a personal matter between me and
my God. It’s not something to have beamed into
my living room by some guy telling me how I’m
going to Hell if I don’t cough up twenty million
bucks for his new condo on Malibu.

The religious dogma that has been acquired
over the years just kills me, like predestination. As
far as I can understand it, God has already chosen
the path of your soul, and you cannot change it. |
like to be kissed before I’m screwed, thank you
very much. Does this mean Saddam Hussein might
end up in Paradise? Makes sense to me, I guess |

 

might as well go shoot up some heroin, and gee,
why not blow away my mailman for a change
since I’m already consigned to one of the two
options. Now there’s an idea that will promote
good deeds and helping one another throughout the
world. ‘

Then we have the fundamentalists. The Bible
becomes the most infallible object since the Ark. °
OK, boneheads, which version? Or, should we all
just learn Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek so we can
read the original manuscripts? They all say that '
God rested on the seventh day after creating the
universe, so does the omnipotent God get tired? A
man (or woman; see, I’m being politically correct) *
wrote the Bible, supposedly several men, and guess
what the Bible is about? Man screwing up and
making God angry. Even Christ gets mad and +
knocks down all the merchant stands.in the temple.
So couldn’t we be a touch off in this otherwise
great work of literature and faith? Nope, sorry, +
you’re going to Hell, forever and ever, amen.

I don’t mean to be bitter. Maybe I’m upset
because as I’m writing this the Braves are down 2-
0 in the World Series. But then I tum on Virginia
television and get this guy who beats his brow ©
with letters from Annie Kate in Blacksburg, who’s |
asking for God to heal her baby brother from
multiple sclerosis, and, in between commercials and ‘
pleas for money, this overly made-up televangelist |
wails up at the heavens for divine intervention. Do
we really have to go through this jerk to talk to
the Almighty?

Now don’t get me wrong. I like the idea of
God, redemption, and the afterlife because I sure
hope life has more meaning than screw others
before they do the same unto you, and I think
Jesus Christ is the greatest person to ever exist °
(Steve Avery of the Braves is second). But I agree ,
with Robin Williams: if Christ comes back, he’s
not going to be a carpenter, he’s going to be a
pissed-off sheet-metal worker asking for Jimmy
Swaggart’s telephone number.

Wilson calls for
new commitment

To the Editor:

Most of us believed it could not happen
here... that somehow our commitment to honor
and civility would shelter us from the violence
which has become all too common on other
campuses across the country. But now, in three
shattering acts of aggression, we have been made
brutally aware that no community in contem-
porary America is immune. Our support and
compassion go out to all who have been affected
by these attacks; students, parents, friends, and
acquaintances.

But the last thing we should do is resign
ourselves to the iniquity of contemporary life.
Instead, we must resolve to marshall all our
resources to put a resounding end to violence,
regardless of its source. We are anything but
powerless at this beginning stage. We have, first
and foremost, a wonderful community of young
men and women who share strength of character.
Together with faculty and staff, our students also
share with each other a deep sense of trust and
a commitment to look after one another. Let us
make sure that we all understand what this
distinctive W&L value entails. It means that we
will step in when strangers are found where they
do not belong, that we will make sure that the
abuse of alcohol is not fostered in our houses,
apartments, or halls, that we will do everything
we possibly can to create an environment in
which sexual exploitation is eliminated... in short,
that we will look after each other and keep each
other, as much as we possibly can, from falling
into harm’s way.

We can and will continue to improve our
formal security measures... modulating security
rounds, improving alarm systems, installing more
lighting where necessary, providing emergency
telephone stations, making sure that students who
feel the need for escort services can quickly and
easily make the necessary arrangements. But,
none of these formal steps will take us half the
way of a renewed, fresh decision to strengthen
our commitment to each other. Let us put an end
to propped doors; casual faith that visitors, much
less strangers, can always be trusted; drinking to
dangerous excess; and any other thoughtless acts
that serves to put ourselves or our friends in
jeopardy.

One of our own has suffered and we can do
nothing to reverse what happened to her. But we
can resolve that it will never happen again. I
hope and pray that all of us will do just that.

Sincerely,
John D. Wilson
President of the University

Hearings give
lessons for W&L

To the Editor:

I am writing in response to the recent events
that have plagued both Washington and Lee and
our nation in the past few weeks. Richard Hill,
in his My View last week, stated that Clarence
Thomas was a winner in the confirmation proc-
ess even though he was attacked by ‘‘the liberal
establishment and by the media’’ and that he
had suffered not the American dream, but the
American nightmare.

While I agree that the way the charge of
sexual harassment was made public was repre-
hensible, those charges did cast a doubt on
Judge Thomas’ ability to serve on the highest
court of this nation. Anita Hill would not have
put herself through that inquisition if she did not

LETTERS

feel there was a basis for the charges. Even if
the charges are not true, they did manage to
make millions wonder about his moral character
and his ability to serve on the Supreme Court.

The confirmation hearings and what both
Anita Hill and Judge Thomas went through were
disgusting and shameful. The entire process
served to illustrate why so many women fail to
report not just cases of sexual harassment, but
rape as well. The members of the W&L com-
munity who did decide to press charges recently
need all the support they can get. Those women
will face the same, if not worse, questions that
Ms. Hill faced. No woman asks to be raped or
sexually harassed, and the belief that any woman
would want a man to do something so horrible
to her is repulsive.

These incidents have served to illustrate the
state of decline that both W&L and the nation
have succumbed to. Something needs to be done
and it must start with ourselves and our atti-
tudes. We are the future leaders of this country
and it is horrible that our community has come
to this. We all must start thinking before we act
or even speak and realize that our actions affect
everyone around us. Hopefully we can rebuild
our community’s sense of trust before our cold,
heartless underside becomes permanent.

Lee A. Rorrer, '93

Student protection
should be W&L’s
first priority

To the Editor:

Marcus Miller is still on campus, and W&L
is looking away. It is as if every student here on
campus has been lied to; were we not promised
a society in which men will act like gentlemen
and women will act like ladies? Marcus Miller
is by no means a gentlemen — he is a con-
victed criminal.

After all, is not the crime that Marcus has
been accused of much more heinous than throw-
ing a brick through a window; a crime for which
the penalty seems to be one suspended semester?
It is a questionable administration that cares
more for its buildings than for its students.

I can’t imagine the anger that the victim
must be experiencing. W&L is not looking out
for her — instead it is sending out the message
that we cannot rely on the school to protect us
from such deviants of society. Somehow, I
expected more loyalty than that.

Sincerely, . bevel ped ic:
Rebecca K. Parkins, 94 :

CRC to review
harassment policy

To the Editor:

As your readers are well aware, the univer-
sity has a policy prohibiting harassment on the
basis of race, religion, national origin, or sex.
The Confidential Review Committee (CRC) is
the organization charged with enforcing the
university’s policy. The 1991-92 Student Hand-
book contains the policy and the procedures of
the CRC. I write to inform your readers that the
CRC is reviewing that policy and its procedures.

   

The CRC plans to complete its review by Feb.
14, 1992. The CRC’s report will be submitted to
the Student Affairs Committee (SAC), the com-
mittee charged with matters relating to student
life. SAC in turn will report to the university
faculty, with whom the decision rests, giving its
recommendations concerning the CRC’s policies
and the university’s policy on harassment.

I write now to invite the participation of
interested students and student organizations in
the review process. The CRC has established
three mechanisms for seeking student views on
this matter. First, we ask that interested students
and groups submit written comments on the
CRC concerning its policies and procedures.
Second, those individuals and organizations
wishing to address the CRC orally will be
invited to attend a public hearing which will be
scheduled for early January. Finally, those
student organizations who wish to present their
views and recommendations at greater length to
the committee are invited to request time for
such a presentation at a committee meeting this
term. Written submissions and requests to ad-
dress the committee prior to the public hearing
should be addressed to me. My office phone
number is 463-8512. Mail will reach me through
intra-campus mail addressed to Lewis Hall,
office 428.

Sincerely,

Phi unaware of
alcohol program

To the Editor:

I would like to direct the Phi’s awareness to
the efforts of W&L students in providing Al-
cohol Awareness programming throughout the
year — an end to the ‘‘overkill.’’

A select group of W&L Peer Counselors and
students on the Health Education Committee
have recently completed a training program on
alcohol education. The student-run program has
been in the works for some time. This group is
prepared to discuss alcohol-related issues on
campus. Their goal is to reach as many students
as possible with their program. Their message is
one of responsible consumption, not one of
abstinence. Their efforts are not to be limited to
one week.

Were you aware of this program last week
when you described Alcohol Awareness efforts
as ‘‘one week of overkill, 29 weeks of ignor-
ance’’?

I respect the Phi’s right to an opinion, but it
appears that a right and a responsibility have
been confused. You have a right to your opin-
ion. You have a responsibility to the students of
W&L to make that opinion an informed one.

The Phi says there is ‘tremendous room for |

improvement’’ in Alcohol Awareness programm-
ing. It’s unfortunate that you failed to recognize
a tremendous effort by W&L students to increase
awareness.

I encourage you to use me as a contact for
Health Education Committee matters in the
future. The committee meets every Thursday at
3 p.m. in the Arlington Women’s Center if
you’d like to send a reporter.

It would be great if you would do a story on
the new Alcohol Awareness program.

Sincerely,
Christopher J. Bray, °91

ial entitled ‘‘Still unaware’’ that appeared in The

Barry-Rec and the Modern Dance class incorporate breathing techniques while stretching.

Class works mind and body

Relax.

That’s essentially what teacher
Collette Barry-Rec wants to get acro-
ss to students enrolled in Physical
Education 178: Modem Dance, a
course unlike any other PE.

“I found the course relaxing but
at the same time invigorating,’’ said
Stacey Morrison, ’89 who took the
course her senior year. ‘‘It was a
completely refreshing change from the
PE curriculum.’

Junior Claudia Kirschhoch is
taking the course now. She described
it as ‘‘a definite break in the hectic
WA&L day.”’

Barry-Rec said the course com-
bines the studies of yoga, movement
consciousness and patterns, balance,
grace, efficiency, and stress reduction.

“I want to diminish the old
wive’s tale that as we get older we
get stiffer,’’ Barry-Rec said.

She begins the course by teaching
students to use their minds to control
their breathing and muscles to over-
ride stress that keeps muscles tense.
Students learn to relax sections of the

body at a time until the body is
entirely relaxed.

Barry-Rec then gradually intro-
duces series of movements and exer-
cises to stretch different muscle
groups.

In one exercise, students take tum
massaging and gently pulling one
another’s legs to relieve stress that
builds up at the hip joint.

Toward the end of the course,
movements are built into a light
dance and exercise routine.

But the course is directed at the
mind as much as the body. ‘‘I really
believe that you are your own best
teacher,’’ Barry-Rec said. ‘‘But we
get so trained to look outward that
we lose contact with our inner
voice.”’

Barry-Rec worked and practiced
dance in New York City until she
ruptured a disk in her spine and had
to have part of the disk removed. She
needed physical therapy before she
could dance again.

Barry-Rec described herself up to
that point as ‘‘performance oriented.

“The therapy not only on a phys-
ical level, but on a psychological
level, was a whole new beginning,”’
she said, ‘‘a re-patterning of move-

ment.’’

According to Barry-Rec, she and
her husband settled in Virginia be-
cause it has the most liberal laws for
parents to home-school their children.

As for her class at W&L,‘‘The
work we do is so new to people's
thinking,’’ Barry-Rec said. ‘‘By the
time the course is over, people think,
‘Can we have an advanced class?’’’

Morrison, who works for Mirabel-
la magazine in New York City, said
what she learncd from Barry-Rec
remains ‘‘completely and utterly
useful’ in her post-graduate life.

She also insisted Barry-Rec’s
interpretation of modern dance ‘‘is
not as non-real world as people
think,’’ and added, ‘‘I still do some
of the exercises she taught us.’’

W&L Assistant Athletic Director
Cinda Rankin said Modern Dance
was introduced to broaden the PE
options for women after the college
went coeducational.

Barry-Rec said, however, at least
one man takes her class almost every
term and she thinks dance can benefit
anyone with an open mind.

“I always just have this wonder-
ful sense of our being one, in spite
of our little differences,’’ she said.

Sloth grabs college readers

 

By Joyce Bautista
Staff Reporter

 

In Roanoke there exists a house.
A house in which five guys from the
"91 graduating class at Hampden-
Sydney reside in ‘‘joyful bliss’’ with
a four-and-a-half month old basset
hound named Thelonius Slothrop
Gammon, Theo for short. From this
house emerges, biweekly, a magazine
that describes itself as ‘‘the essential
guide to keeping life interesting,’’
better known as The Mojo Sloth.

*‘It was harder than we tho.
ught to find a name,’’ Rob-
ert Beverly, one of the y
five members of the editor\ _
ial staff. ‘‘‘Norman’ was the
first thing we seriously consid-\
ered,’’ Beverly said. But event-
ually they decided upon calling it ©
The Mojo Sloth.

According to Beverly, it’s the

sloth of the three-fingered lazy
variety. The adjective ‘‘mojo’’ was
once used to describe the Delta Blues
players. ‘In essence,’’ Beverly said,
“The Mojo Sloth is a free, laid-back
creature that likes blues music.”’

Beverly along with Mark Gam-
mon, Rick Koehler, Tripp Reynolds,
and Paul Scanniello began production
in August of this year. ‘‘Paul, Mark,
and I were wondering what to do
with the rest of our lives,’’ Beverly
said. They considered the fact that
there was nothing in common for all
the colleges in the area to read.
““We thought there was room for a
publication to bring the schools toget-
her,’” he said.

They currently distribute their
magazine to 11 colleges and several
stores in the Central Virginia area. It
arrives On campus every other Wed-
nesday.

After Reynolds and Koehler came
on board, The Mojo Sloth was com-
plete. Each editor contributed $800 to
buy much needed equipment, such as
a Xerox machine and a laser printer.

The biggest problem the staff has
encountered has been with advertis-
ing. ‘‘Advertisers have been slow to
get on the wagon,”’ Beverly said.

The second biggest problem facing
the staff, however, according to Bev-
erly, is getting Theo housetrained.

“All has been peaceful with the
five guys in the house,’’ Beverly
said. ‘‘We have been able to avoid 3

a.m. food fights and gun play.’’
Most importantly, the staff at The
Mojo Sloth pride themselves on the
freedom they encourage about the
subject matter of submitted pieces.
“I can’t say, unfortunately, that we
have received much from W&L stu-
dents,’’ he said. ‘‘We welcome con-
tributions of work from anyone who
cares to send them.”’

W&L junior
Scott Smith
said. ‘‘It

    
  
  
  
   
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  

Bev-
erly said
The Mojo :
hasn’t receiv- ed one bad
letter yet and has found an
unexpected audience in the young
adults just out of college, as well as
the collegiate crowd. ‘‘Students need
to read something other than
textbooks or a USA Today,’’ Beverly

saa freshman Bevan Ovens,
agrees. ‘‘I find The Mojo Sloth a
good release from school and an
escape from textbooks,’’ Ovens said.
‘*T read the last issue from cover to
cover.””

Administrative Assistant to Resi-
dence Life Chris Bray, looks to The
Mojo Sloth as a good guide to con-
certs. ‘‘I’ve found it handy in locat-
ing concerts in the Charlottesville and
D.C. area,’’ he said.

Scanniello, the entertainment edit-
or, said he especially likes the fact
that the magazine is unstructured.
‘*As a writer, I get to try different
things,”’ he said.

“The only guideline we really
have is length,’’ Beverly said. The
most recent issues have been using
the concept of the theme, the last one
being ‘‘decadence.’’ ‘‘It’s like an egg
that holds things together,’ he said.

Sloth

Regardless, of their use of theme,
Beverly encourages writers to submit
anything. ‘‘We keep content as open
as possible,’’ he said. ‘‘Relevance to
world events isn’t a pre-requisite.’’
Beverly said the editorial staff is
conservative but always tries to stay
apolitical.

Their most immediate goal is
making some money. ‘‘We also hope
to get established, expand to the rest
of the state and reach more stu-
dents,’’ Beverly: said. But his aspira-
tions go even higher. ‘‘Next we go
global, have a publishing empire, and
then world domination.’’

Scanniello also has great hopes for
the magazine. ‘‘I plan to stick with
the Sloth until world domination,’’ he
said. ‘‘That is unless I start scraping
the ocean floor for food, whichever

- acomes first.’’

“I want to be a writer for the rest
of my life,’’ Scanniello said,
,, He had just done his first
interview ever. According to
im, it was a phone interview
ith the legendary Lloyd Cole

who was in Scotland. ‘‘We talked
about his music and childhood bath-
ing habits,’ he said.

The ‘‘Rock and Roll’’ issue ar-
rived yesterday, but future themes are
not being released. ‘‘I could tell
you,’’ Beverly said, ‘‘but then I'd
have to kill you.”’

— Paul Scanniello

 

Beverly describes the staff as an
eclectic bunch. that run the gamut of
personalities, appearances, and ec-
centricities.

‘‘We've always got comments to
make about something,’ Reynolds
said.

Yet, according to Beverly, they do
have some important things in com-
mon. ‘‘We all have a twisted sense
of humor, a love of rock and roll
music and waffle houses, and pover-
ty,”’ he said. ‘‘Oh yeah, and Theo.”

Deer rate better than D-hall

 

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

The thrill of the chase has begun for hundreds
of sportsmen preparing for the fall hunting season.
Bow hunting season for deer is now well under

D-hall fare,’’ Van Os said.

But sophomore Jim Géilreath, of Greenville,
S.C., will wait until deer season for firearms begins
Nov. 18 before trying his luck in the wilds of

Rockbridge County.

“It’s the outdoor element that I enjoy. It’s good
chance to learn about nature,’’ Gilreath said.

“‘No real big deer have come
in yet this year,’’ Sandy Nye of
Kelly’s Corner said. Of the
twelve deer that had been
weighed at Kelly’s Comer as of
Wednesday, the largest was a
109 Ib. buck brought in by
Lexington resident Preston Wil-
liams.

One of more than a dozen
deer check-in points in Rock-
bridge County, Kelly’s Comer
on route 60 west is expecting to
weigh over 300 deer before the
season ends in early January.

While McDaniel is sidelined this
fall recovering from surgery, the
woods around Lexington will be
filled with sportsmen.

‘“‘There’s no doubt in my mind,
bow hunting definitely takes preced-
ence over school work,’’ Van Os
said.

 

 

Henry Van Os, a sophomore,
began his hunting career last year. But, this year
he has put down his rifle and taken up bow
hunting.

“It feels better than a gun,’’ Van Os said. ‘‘It’s
more native... like an Indian.”

 

“There is no doubt in my
mind, bow hunting definite-
ly takes precedence over
school.”’

— Henry Van Os

Van Os has been out combing the woods seven
times already this year, including once back home
in Georgia where he got his first bow-kill, a 110-
pound doe.

A hunter since junior high school, Gilreath Figg
worked in Canada this summer preserving the <.

wetlands for water fowl.

“It was my way of putting something back into

nature,’’ he said.

Besides deer, Gilreath has tried his luck with
different types of water fowl and turkeys as well.
Turkey hunting is a fascination of Anthropol-
ogy Professor John McDaniel. Besides being an

avid sportsman, McDaniel has written two

and several magazine articles on the art of hunting

turkeys are exceedingly clever with near-perfect

hunters in the Peruvian jungle, has a great respect Van Os takes aim at his tarcet.

Trustees to
discuss new art
gallery proposal

The Washington and Lee Board of Trus-

tees, including two new members, is sched-

uled to discuss the construction of the Wat-
son Gallery during its mnbing in Lexington
this weekend.

In its meeting Friday morning the Capital
Projects Committee will consider approving
the building, Communications Director and
Trustee Brian Shaw said.

Shaw said the Board is likely to reach a
decision this weekend either to approve or
disapprove the plans for the gallery, which
is being donated by Mrs. William Watson,
the widow of a W&L alumnus.

The gallery is being built to house the
Watsons’ $6 million to $10 million collec-
tion of Chinese art.

The construction of the Watson Gallery
has sparked protest from faculty and students

who think its planned site behind the Reeves

he had collected 700-800 signatures.

The Washington and Lee football
team came up short on the field
again last weekend at Hampden-Syd-
ney, but not before putting a scare
into the Tigers.

W&L trailed just 10-7 late in the
third quarter, but the Tigers capital-
ized on a missed tackle to reclaim
momentum and go on to a 24-7 win.

With 30 seconds left in the third
quarter, H-SC tried a reverse to Jay
Hicks. W&L junior Lyle Smith had a
chance to stop Hicks in the back

field, but Hicks was able to slip
away and scamper 35 yards for a
touchdown.

H-SC led 10-0 in the second
quarter before W&L got its offense
going. W&L sophomore linebacker
Grant Rea intercepted a H-SC pass
and retumed it to the Tigers’ 32 yard
line. On the next play, freshman
quarterback Geren Steiner hit fellow
freshman Hayne Hodges for a touch-
down and sent the Generals into the
locker room with momentum.

‘At halftime I thought we had an
outstanding chance to win the game,”’
said head coach Gary Fallon. ‘‘I was
impressed with our defense at times.

W&L managed just 49 total yards
on the day and managed just five
first downs. And that cost the Gen-
erals in the second half.

‘‘We came out and played a flat
second half,’’ Fallon said. ‘‘We pid-
dled away good field position, and
they just wore us down.”

H-SC ran 83 plays to W&L’s 38.
All told, the W&L defense was on
the field for 42:30. ‘‘It was fright-
ening how long our defense was on
the field.’’

Smith led the workhorse defense,
registering 19 tackles. Freshman
James Mayberry had 10 tackles and
an interception, and freshman Jason
Chartrand, junior Phil Spears and
senior John McCallum each had 10

tackles.

The General who had the best day
was junior punter Bob Ehret. Ehret
tied two school records. His 76-yard
punt equalled the longest in school-
history, and his 46.9 average equalled
the single-game highest average.

“I still have to admire our kids,”’
said Fallon. ‘‘We’re 0-6 and disap-
pointed that we lost, but we aren’t
down.

“I’ve been around teams that
have lost, and they lost more than
games. They lost respect for each
other and the coaches. This team isn’t
even close to that,’’ Fallon said.
‘‘Our attitude is that we’ve got four
more games to play, and we're going
to get after it in each one.”’

This week, the Generals will face
what Fallon calls the toughest test of
the season. W&L will make a nine-

hour bus trip into western Tennessee
to take on Sewanee.

The Tigers are unbeaten at 5-0-1
on the year and hoping to qualify for
the NCAA playoffs. Sewanee is rank-
ed in the top seven in the South
Region.

‘This is our biggest challenge of
the season,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘They’re
undefeated and ranked. The game is
at their place and it’s Homecoming.
But we’ve got to accept the challenge
and give a heck of an effort. If we
do that, I won’t be disappoint

late, and despite a sub-par showing in
a tournament at Western Maryland,
the Generals are on the road to re-
covery.

‘*Even though we didn’t do well at
the tournament, we came together as
a team,’’ said senior captain Mena
McGowin. ‘‘We had a meeting at the
end of the tournament which was
really positive.’’

Another positive despite the 1-3
showing was the play of junior Leslie
Hess. Hess set a single season record
for block points with 48 for the year.
Hess also helped McGowin out offen-
sively, registering 36 kills for the
week.

The Generals’ sole win came over
Notre Dame (Md.) 14-16, 15-7, 15-
12.

Earlier in the week, the Generals
dropped two tough Old Dominion
Athletic Conference games to Lynch-
burg and Bridgewater. Against BC,
the Generals got their first ever single
game win over the Eagles, 15-6.
Oddly enough, it was the reserves,
led by juniors B.J. League and Fran
Ascher who led the way.

McGowin said the bench play has

This week, the Generals have three

important ODAC matches against

Hollins. The Generals will look to
take some momentum into the ODAC
tournament with three wins.

“They are really important

Though the Washington and Lee
women’s soccer game Saturday was
a decided loss, 5-0 to nationally
ranked Methodist, head coach Janine
Hathorn was happy with her team’s
performance.

‘Methodist is a great team. A S-
0 win is a big score in soccer, but
it’s not a big score against a team
that’s as good as they are,’’ she said.

‘‘We were hoping to do well
against their team and I think we did.
I have no complaints against our
team at all.”’

Hathorn commended the perfor-
mance of senior Nancy Mitchell and
sophomores Corinda Hankins and
Karen Stutzmann. She was also
pleased with the play of the sub-
stitutes.

After this non-conference game,
the Generals are now 4-4-2 overall
and 4-1-1 in the Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference. Today’s game
against Sweet Briar, at 4:30 p.m. at
Liberty Hall Field, will be their final
regular season conference game.

A win would guarantee the Gen-
erals second seed in the tournament.
Roanoke has clinched the top seed.

‘‘We always seem to play down
to the level of the other team,’’ Hath-

om said. ‘‘Our major focus this
week is to keep our level of play and
score goals whether it is a Methodist
or a Sweet Briar or a Hollins or a
Roanoke.”’

As the Generals look ahead to the
ODAC tournament next weekend,
they are hoping for a win against
Sweet Briar.

“Our sights have been set all
year; we're just trying to do really
well in the conference. The game
against Methodist sort of put in per-
spective just how attainable winning
the conference championship really
is,’’ said Hathorn.

VWC leaves W&L thinking

With the first round of the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference Tour-
nament beginning next Tuesday, it is
the time of the year when the teams
want to be peaking.

Unfortunately for the Washington
and Lee men’s soccer team, last
Saturday was not a good indication
that the team is ready to play its best
soccer.

A 4-0 loss to Virginia Wesleyan
puts the Generals in a must-win
situation this Saturday as they play
their last regular season ODAC game
against Lynchburg. A win, and the
Generals host a first round game. A
loss, and the Generals might have to
travel and open the tournament on the
road.

The loss left the team with differ-

ing opinions about the way it played.
Head coach Rolf Piranian was notice-
ably dejected after the loss. ‘‘Va.
Wesleyan is good, but they aren’t
that good,’ he said. ‘‘Our team real-
ly didn’t play well at all.’’

Some of the players, though,
thought otherwise. Senior Bobby
Weisgerber and freshman Eric Tracy
thought that Va. Wesleyan was just a
very strong team.

“‘They were a very strong team
and they had a very potent offense.
They also had great speed up front,
and they beat us to thé ball.’’ said
Weisgerber.

‘‘T thought we played with them,”’
said Tracy. ‘‘We made some stupid
mistakes, but I think we played
well.’’

For right now, though, the Gen-
erals must be more concerned about
Lynchburg. Piranian said he’s not

worried about a let-down on Sat-
urday because of the Va. Wesleyan
loss.

‘*There won’t be a let-down after
this loss,’’ he said. ‘‘You don’t have
a letdown in this situation,”’

Ore positive thing to come out of
Satv.day’s loss was the retum of
M:ke Mitchem. The junior saw his
first action since injuring his knee in
the third game of the year. Mitchem
played well, and that should give the
Generals a boost going into the
Lynchburg game.

The final game will be played at
Lynchburg on Saturday at 2 p.m.
After that, the schedule is up in the
air. If the Generals win they will
stay home for a game on Tuesday.
But is they should lose, they would
open the tournament on the road, and
that is exactly what Piranian and the
Generals don’t want.

CC keeps on
running strong

 

By Jacob Kimball
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
cross country team gave its ‘‘best
showing in years’’ according to a
pleased head coach John Tucker.

The men finished third overall at
the Virginia State Championships
held in Williamsburg, Va. W&L has
never finished higher at this meet
since Tucker became coach four years
ago.

The two teams that finished ahead
of the Generals were Lynchburg and
Mary Washington, the top two teams
in the Southeast Region. The final
tally among the top three teams in a
field of ten was LC 24, MWC 67,
and W&L 81.

The finish was made even sweeter
because the team out-pointed Chris-
topher Newport for the first time
after narrowly losing twice last year.

Bo Hannah once again led the
‘team and finished second overall with
a personal record of 25:52.

Charles Edwards continues to tum
in solid performances as he finished
seventh overall at 26:45. Not far
behind the consistently strong Ed-
wards were junior Keith Rinn and
freshman Matthew Brock.

The team’s overall record is a
very respectable 5-1, and they have
registered an unblemished 3-0 mark
in Old Dominion Athletic Conference
competition. This puts the Generals
in the drivers seat for a season cham-
pionship. W&L has beaten its remain-
ing ODAC foes already this year.

Some of those teams will be
competing in the inaugural Washing-
ton and Lee Invitational this weekend.
The Generals will host seven other
teams as they strive to continue their
string of strong showings.

The women’s team staggered into
the state, yet still managed a respec-
table showing.

The team, depleted by injuries and
other various misfortunes, was up
against the top Division II and III
teams in the state. Formidable Mary
Washington College took the top
honors, yet Washington and Lee
placed sixth overall.

Although the team didn’t run
quite as well as it would have liked,
freshman Kim Herring once again
showed she is capable of running
with the best in the state. She

finished seventh overall, leading the
Generals with a time of 20:37.

This weekend, the Generals will
run in the W&L Invitational. As
many as six teams are expected to
compete.

with Halloween

 

By Craig Burke
Assignment Editor

In an effort to make Halloween
safer in Lexington, several
Washington and Lee students will
help Lexington children trick-or-treat
tonight.

Kappa Alpha Theta will sponsor
‘*Witch Watch’’ for the second year,
junior Jennifer Gladwell said. With
the aid of about 50 cadets from Vir-
ginia Military Institute, Theta mem-
bers will patrol Lexington streets that
children tend to visit on Halloween.

The students will help kids cross
the street and make sure older child-
ren don’t pick on the younger ones,
Gladwell said. She ‘said everyone

involved with ‘‘Witch Watch’’ will
wear reflector tape or reflector vests.

“Our program is a preventive
measure,’’ Gladwell said. ‘‘We hope
our presence on the street will keep
vandalism and harassment of little
kids to a minimum.”’

Senior Amy Beall said that mem-
bers of Chi Omega and Sigma Phi
Epsilon will escort children through
Gaines Hall and through residential
areas of Lexington as they trick-or-
treat.

Parents can bring their children to
the Fairfax Lounge in the W&L
University Center tonight between
5:00 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., she said.

“This might take the burden off
parents who don’t want to go trick-
or-treating,’’ Beall said.

 

 

 

Black fraternity visits

 

By Cathy Lopiccolo
News Editor

 

Alpha Phi Alpha, a historically
black fraternity, is aiming to re-es-
tablish a chapter on campus this
winter, a fraternity representative said.

Alpha Director for District 7 and
Virginia President Byron Bullock
called his Oct. 23 visit to Washington
and Lee ‘‘informative.”’

“It provided me an opportunity to
talk to people here about what alter-
natives were available and about the
logistics of a chapter,’’ Bullock said.
‘ W&L students interested in bring-
ing a historically black fraternity to
campus contacted Alpha in the spring,
Bullock said. W&L had an Alpha
¢hapter in the 1970s, but it folded.

Bullock spent his day meeting
with administrators, students and the
Student Affairs Committee.

Associate Dean of Students for
Greek Affairs Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’
Atkins said Bullock clarified some
issues for him.

‘ “It really had not been explained
how Alpha would mesh with our
Interfraternity Council,’’ Atkins said.
« Atkins said before an Alpha chap-
ler could colonize at W&L, SAC

must determine. if a chapter could
succeed. If SAC approves, inter-
ested students would petition the IFC
to invite Alpha onto campus.

Bullock said an Alpha chapter
would be an active member of the
existing IFC. He said Alpha’s
‘‘membership intake process’’ would
have to be approved by the IFC,
because it is slightly different from
W&L’s rush.

Alpha does not limit its member-
ship to black men, Bullock said, but
only men who have completed 12
credit hours are eligible. That means
Alpha would not accept freshmen for
membership during fall Rush.

Bullock said Alpha is most wor-
ried about the W&L chapter’s size.

‘*We would be interested in work-
ing with the chapter to make certain
it has the numbers and keeps them
up,’’ Bullock said. ‘‘It would be a
priority, since we know it may be a
problem.”’

He said other Alpha chapters have
from seven to 30 members.

Atkins said a small Alpha chapter
might not be able to pay the IFC
fees paid by other fraternities. He
said an exception coud be made for
Alpha since their programming would
be different.

Brice said his goal for the

supports the idea of freshmen join-
ing fraternities early in the year,
he would like freshmen to be able
to ‘“‘hang out with each other
sometimes."’

Stewart said he and Brice hope
to hold a freshman class mixer
‘*sometime before Christmas.’’

King said he is honored to be
able to ‘‘uphold the tradition of

“The great thing about the
Honor System is that it doesn’t put
fear in people, but instead people
respect it,’’ King said.

Trustees postpone
decision on gallery

Board asks for review of alternate sites

 

By Cathy Lopiccole
News Editor

 

Construction of the proposed Watson Gallery
will be delayed at least two months while the
Washington and Lee administration reviews
possible alternative sites for the building.

During its meeting Oct. 25-26, the W&L
Board of Trustees requested the review, partial-
ly in response to student concerns about the
building’s placement behind the Reeves Center
and the Colonnade.

“The board asked the administration to
make sure alternatives had been examined,”’
University President and Trustee John D. Wil-
son said.

Board members voted during their meetings
not to make individual statements about the
Watson Gallery and appointed Wilson as their
spokesman on the issue, W&L Communica-
tions Director Brian Shaw said.

Money to build the controversial gallery was
donated by Mrs. William Watson, the widow
of a W&L alumnus, to house her $6 to $10
million Chinese art collection.

The board had been scheduled to give its
final approval to the gallery last weekend, and
construction was tentatively scheduled to start
in December.

However, Wilson said now he must meet
with the board’s Capital Projects Committee in
late November to discuss alternative locations.
He said the building’s construction will not be
approved until the board’s next meeting in
February, and construction could not begin
before then.

Junior Richard Chapman circulated a petition
protesting the building’s location on what he
called the last natural area on the Colonnade.

He said he was pleased with the board’s deci-
sion.

‘In a perfect scenario, it would have been
great if they had just said, no, we definitely
won't build it here,’ Chapman said. ‘‘At least
they did go back to square one.”’

; icant Chapman met with
the Capital Projects
Committee chairman,
Beverly DuBose, dur-
ing the board’s meet-
ing, and spoke to him
once over the phone.
Chapman said DuBose
im explained the problems
involved with trying to
‘jchange the location of
the gallery.
Chapman said he
was told the trustees’
main concern is that
Wilson the Watson Gallery
and the Reeves Center stay together. If the
Watson Gallery is built in another location, the
university may have to spend its own money to
move the Reeves Center also.

In addition, Chapman said the trustees want
to place the gallery in a place where it will be
used by students.

Wilson said the board was pleased with the
architectural design for the building.

‘One trustee observed, in his time here, it
is the most exquisite architectural concept he’d
had a chance to see,’’ Wilson said.

In other business, the board discussed the
recent incidents of rape and sexual assault on
or near campus, but did not take any formal
action, Wilson said. He said the board is en-
couraged that W&L students have begun trying
to protect each other.

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

NEw Houses,
NEw RULES

No one ever said it would be perfect,
and at the midpoint of the Fraternity
Renaissance Program, that’s what mem-
bers of the renovated fraternity houses

have realized.

While most fraternity men concede that their houses look
better, they claim university rules hinder their ability to enjoy

themselves.

“The fraternity system at
W&L has changed from one
with almost no constraints to
one with the university par-

enting us,’’ Phi Kappa Sigma President Marc Short said.

The renaissance program, which began with Sigma Alpha
Epsilon in April 1990, has renovated eight of the 14 participat-
ing houses. The other finished houses include Sigma Nu, Phi
Delta Theta, Pi Kappa Alpha, Phi Kappa Sigma, Beta Theta Pi,
Lambda Chi Alpha, and Kappa Sigma.

Washington and Lee has spent about $7.6 million on the first
eight houses, Coordinator of Capital Planning Frank Parsons
said. He said the university expects the entire program to cost

about $13.1 million.

Despite the investment of time and money, several other
fraternity men agreed with Short’s assessment.

Sophomore Alex Cruikshank, a
member of Phi Delta Theta, said the
main drawback to living in the new
house is the complex system of rules
and regulations governing behavior in
and upkeep of the renovated houses.

‘And it’s probably not as much
fun as living in the old house,”’
Cruiskshank said.

Sigma Nu sophomore Jason Aiken
complained about university regula-
tions as well.

‘The way the university is crack-
ing down on fraternity behavior in
the new house is a real pain in the
butt,’’ Aiken said.

Campus in crisis:
ideas for us all

Three weeks have passed since the latest incident
of sexual violence at Washington and Lee, and in
many minds the shock has passed. For those
students involved in this and other recent, similar
incidents, things will not soon be forgotten, but for
the rest of us, these events are beginning to fade.

We, as a staff, have learned a number of things
from our close attention to these events. Through our
discussions with police, victims, the accused,
administrators and student leaders, we have seen
things from a number of viewpoints. We thought it
an appropriate closing to our three-part editorial to
Share some of the things we have learned.

There are the obvious warnings that we have all
heard time and time again; they deserve repetition:

We all need to have the common sense to lock our
doors at night. No one, especially a woman, should
walk around after dark alone, particularly while
drunk. You need to figure out how you’re going to
get home from a party before you go, and stick to
the plan. Never hesitate to call W&L Security or the
Lexington Police if you have been attacked or feel
threatened.

The most important point of all, and ironically the
one everyone already knows, is that abuse of alcohol
makes everyone more vulnerable.

From the woman who sends unclear signals about
what she is willing to do sexually, to the man who
can’t tell what she wants, everyone’s judgement is
hampered by overuse of alcohol. That is not to say
that women always send unclear signals, but it does
happen. Alcohol abuse is not something many people
want to address at W&L, but students should at least
recognize that it is the root cause of many other
serious problems.

For three weeks now, we have labeled this
university a campus in crisis. We know it’s hard to
believe there is a real crisis while classes go on as
usual for most everyone. But for a few of our
classmates, the past months have been traumatic
times that have changed their lives forever. For them,
it has been a crisis. Our. goal in our coverage of
these events and in our editorials has been to bring to
everyone’s attention that bad things do happen to
people in our usually honorable community. We hope
students have gained enough awareness to protect
themselves and each other in the future.

That said, we still believe that W&L is a special
place. We have seen some terrible things happen, but
we can be proud of the fact that ours is a relatively
safe, caring, honorable community where no one has
to endure their pain alone. That’s more than most
colleges can say.

No, things won’t be perfect here in the future.
They’ve never been that way. But if we know what
to expect, we'll be better prepared to avoid or deal

with the dangers.

As a community, we should move on and enjoy
our time here. We should not forget the lessons we
have learned.

Ever notice how there’s always that one person
in your class? You know who I’m talking about:
the guy (or girl, but I’ll stick with the generic guy;
feminists, too bad, read another column) that
always has his four pencils sharpened to a dagger
point, the guy that always reads ahead, the guy
that always has his hand up in class to answer the
most impossible of questions. Yes, we’re talking
about the Sycophant Student. No, he isn’t a sick
elephant; for all you non-English majors out there,
“*sycophant’’ means ‘‘bootlicker.’’ (I know, maybe

Steve Avery is God, amen.)

Thinking about types of students got me
wondering about every single person in my classes.
The English Department is nothing if not widely
varied in its students (joined by the occasional C-
school major who realizes he needs a lit
requirement to graduate; you recognize them
straight-off by their need to spout off flow charts
and supply-demand curves — the 20 pound Econ
textbook is a good signal, too. I confess, I took
two courses in the C-school, but only after severe
financial prodding by my father, the banker). So, .
let’s check out the typical W&L classroom (get out
your pens and turn to page 1 of Swann’s
Dichotomy of a Classroom). NOTE: I would

describe all of my professors, but supposedly one
of them took offense at a quotation about Paradise
Lost in last week’s column, so in order to preserve

Prof. demands
return of scanner

To the Editor:

Perhaps this will add a bit to the on-going
discussion of security, honor, crime, and some-
times punishment that has marked the beginning
of this school year.

As part of the equipping of a new electronic
news laboratory in Reid Hall, a new Uniden
public service radio scanner was installed. Just
sitting. on a desk, happily squawking out police,
fire, first aid, and, yes, even W&L security radio
messages, the little fellow called attention to
himself. After about a month on duty he disap-
peared, Stolen? Probably. By whom? Someone
knows.

Has someone suddenly shown up with a
Uniden Bearcat model BC-147XL radio scanner?
Here's a small opportunity to test our system of
trust. Maybe make a statement that things aren’t
as troubling as they have seemed lately. Are
they?

Recruitment chair
criticizes the Phi

To the Editor:

On behalf of the Admissions Office and the
Student Recruitment Committee, I would like to
respond to last week’s editorial. I believe the
editorial concerning the SRC was not only
misleading, but bordered on an outright lie.

First of all, I would like to clarify the SRC’s
purpose. The committee members are chosen for
their enthusiasm and love for Washington and
Lee. They tell prospective students about their
own experiences at W&L. Consequently, mem-
bers do not pull stories out of the blue and tell
them through ‘‘rose-colored glasses;’’ they simply
reiterate their own experiences at W&L.

As for the inaccurate quoting of Mrs. Kozak,
I would like to mention that the editor left off
part of what she told him in the interview.
Although Mrs. Kozak did say that the SRC
would not have another formal meeting until
January, she also said that she was spreading the
word through the committee’s chairmen that
members should not give the impression that
W&L is a ‘‘safe haven.’’ Letters have already
been sent out informing members of her mes-
sage.

Finally, I would like to add that the SRC also
tells prospective students about the superiority of
Washington and Lee’s journalism department.
One would hope that the school newspaper would
reflect the strength of Reid Hall; however, unsub-
stantiated editorials and bad interviewing techni-

 

  

whatever grade I may have left in his classes, I'll
hold off on that. Until next week.

The Sycophant — mentioned above. Usually
either somebody with an irritating voice who
babbles constantly, or, more rarely, a person of
lower intelligence attempting to ingratiate himself
with the teacher. Easily spotted by their arm
shooting up in the air before a professor’s question
is finished. Most teachers recognize these students
and use them for great amusement.

The Wit — this is usually the person who
forgot to do their homework and gets by with
making the teacher and the class laugh for five
minutes. Always engaged in a battle of words with
the professor, who either ignores the Wit or, more
fun, rolls up his sleeves and joins in a verbal
barrage and test of male ego to the delight of the
other people who didn’t do their homework either.
Almost never a girl; they all do their homework
anyway and get by with one or two caustic lines
to the teacher each semester.

The Individual — this is the guy who stands
out in a crowd, usually by what they’re wearing.
I know one who wears typical W&L attire: button-
down shirt, Duck Heads, and a baseball cap over
unwashed hair. Then he puts on bright green shoes.
Diverts the teacher’s attention long enough for you
to speed-read the assignment. Usually the most
interesting person in the class.

The Cynic — there’s always one of these, never
agreeing with the teacher’s reading of a poem or
translation of a line of French prose. Usually fills
the gap, of silence after a teacher's explanation of
a passage with ‘‘I don’t think he means that at
all.”’ Initially funny, eventually tiring because they
never seem to believe in anything whatsoever.

The Brooder — this is the Marlboro-smoking,
squinty-eye-looking, depressed- or bitter-sounding

LETTERS

ques certainly do not exemplify this. I suggest
that, in the future, the editor quotes people more
carefully so that Student Recruitment members
are not portraying W&L’s journalism department
‘‘through rose-colored glasses.”’

 

Sincerely,
Heather M. Midkiff
Student Recruitment Chairman

Problems call for
renewal of spirit

To the Editor:

The recent events of rape, theft, and general
craziness at Washington and Lee have left all of
us shocked. The Phi has labeled us a ‘‘Campus
in Crisis.’ Have you sensed, as I have, a great
sadness gripping the student body the past few
weeks? Why do we feel so confused and empty
at a place that has been so warm, friendly, and
secure for us? We sometimes feel so helpless in
solving our problems. With all the rapid changes
happening at W&L, we question whether the
sadness and coldness can be removed. Can we
reverse the bad trends and revive the honored
traditions?

As discouraged as I was reading Chris Sw-
ann’s article entitled ‘‘Religious Fundamentalism
and the Braves’’ in last week's Phi, I will say
that what W&L needs was answered, although
awkwardly and unintentionally, by his article. As
a Christian, I was disheartened by the main
points that Chris made. But there are two state-
ments that he made which I feel hold the key to
renewing the real W&L.

Chris made the point that ‘‘even Christ gets
mad and knocks down all the merchant stands in
the temple.’’ This story, found in John 2, tells
how Jesus found people selling animals and
exchanging money in the temple. Jesus showed
human anger as he demanded, ‘‘How dare you
turn my Father’s house into a market!’’ I feel the
same kind of anger as I look at my school.
‘‘How dare you tum my beloved campus into a
regular old college!’’ There are people, students,
and faculty who are selling out our university
and, just as Jesus got mad, I think we should be.
Each of us has a responsibility to uphold the
traditions and honor that brought us here.

The second statement that Chris made con-
taining real power came near the end of his
essay. After questioning the source of hope in
life, Chris says, ‘‘I think Jesus Christ is the
greatest person ever to exist.’’ Chris, thank you
for pointing out the real hope and meaning of
life and the best source of renewal for our
campus. God really is awesome, and He can do
great things on our campus ‘if we let him.

 
  

individual at the very back of the room. Never,
speaks and looks either downright pissed-off at the’
world or very melancholy. You either want to puti
your arm around this person and reassure them that.
the sun won’t implode for another five billion’
years, or sit five aisles away and hope they never,
look at you with that New Yorker stare.

The Popular One — typically Mr. or Mrs.'
W&L. Their hair is perfectly combed, teeth,
straight, dress impeccable, and they’re surrounded
by a number of other students, like lesser satellites!
around a gas giant. They always have their,
homework done and, while not the brightest one in’
the class, they can always say something. You end,
up wanting for this person to either include you in
his or her entourage or hope they die because they’
make you want to vomit. Sometimes, however,
they’re the nicest and most sincere people in m
class,

The Genius — here’s the one that iow
everything, studies five hours a night in between
filling out Rhodes Scholarship applications and
writing an honors thesis. Usually friendly but in a
big hurry to do their next thing —  type- A
personality in a big way. Sometimes can be one off
the above models (see Brooder, Individual, or even
Cynic). At times very superior, sometimes very’
nice, but always looking for something else oni
which to flex their synapses.

The Perfect Student — does homework all the
time, but not so much as to appear sycophanticy
Friendly to all students, regardless of category.
Likes. to. hassle the teacher once in a while, but
never insulting him or her openly (funny at times
but eventually degrading and in bad taste). Goes to
the Palms on occasion after writing a term paper:
Doesn’t exist anywhere near Lexington, at least in
my experience.

Would you say that our campus was moving
in a good direction when Robert E. Lee was
president of the college? When Lee became
president he made the following statement: ‘‘I
dread the thought of any student going away
from the college without becoming a sincere
Christian.’ Lee made clear that the spiritual
renewal and growth of the student body was
“the leading object that brought me here.’
[General Robert E. Lee After Appomattox, p.
193]. Lee did not force students to go to daily
devotions in the chapel of conform to Chris-
tianity. Yet, students were influenced and in-
spired by his character and faith.

It’s 1991, and I am further saddened because
I just finished watching the Braves lose the
World Series to the Minnesota Hankies. The
Braves lost, but W&L doesn’t have to. I believe
that today our campus is spiritually dry and is
crying our for renewal. The renewal calls for a
return to faith and trust in God. Won’t you give
God a chance to move our campus in the best
direction? Chris, I couldn’t have said it better:
‘Christ is the greatest.’’

Sincerely,
Nathan Dunn, ’94

Exchange student
Clarifies quotes.

To the Editor:

In a somewhat belated response to your recent
article about me, let me first say that its author, |
Brian McClung, fastidiously quoted me verbatim. |
Thus, the misunderstandings contained below
arise only from unintentional misinterpretation '
and from my sloppy use of the English language |
during our interview.

First, while the women at W&L are indeed |
‘tabsolutely gorgeous,’’ they are not what I like
best about the university. Call me old-fashioned
if you want, but intellectual inquiry just sneaks |
in.

Second, I do not think that all Americans tend
to act, look, and dress the same: however, | {
believe this can be said for most W&L students
(Duck Head is presumably laughing all the way
to the bank).

Please also note for the record that my room-
mate was not au naturel when I disturbed him
‘‘at play’’ with his girlfriend. He had, of course, |
the requisite good taste and sense of decorum to
wear a robe when he came to the door.

Yours etc.,

Counselors teach
alcohol awareness

By Maureen Levey
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee peer coun-
selors are expanding their roles from
hotline operators to alcohol awareness
educators.

Under the guidance of University
Counselor of Psychology Dr. James
W. Worth, the peer counselors are
promoting an outreach program in the
W&L dormitory halls on the effects
of irresponsible drinking.

“The outreach program is for
students to promote greater awareness
of the effects of alcohol and one’s
own values,’’ Worth said. ‘‘We want
to get more people talking about it.’’

Six groups of three students will
tour the dormitory halls with a twen-
ty minute video and follow with a
discussion period. The group is com-
prised of peer counselors

accompanied by a few Health
Education Committee members wha
will provide interested students with
health awareness information.

Head Peer Counselor Roger Sul-
livan, a senior, stresses ‘the
educational aspect of the program.

‘‘We’re = going to emphasize
responsible drinking because we all
realize that alcohol is an aspect of
the W&L social life,’’ Sullivan said.

‘*We are not here to tell people
what they can and cannot do, or
should and should not do with al-
cohol,’’ Worth said.

Associate Dean of Students Anne
Schroer-Lamont said she hopes
student leaders, especially those in
fraternities and sororities, will ask the
peer counselors to speak to their
organizations.

‘‘The best programs are the ones
developed by students,’’ Schroer-
Lamont said.

 

Two local youths were accused of shoplifting from the Ee
Washington and Lee Bookstore Tuesday, Lexington Police

Chief Bruce Beard said.

The juveniles, ages 14 and 15, walked out of the >
bookstore about 11 a.m. with three cassette tapes worth

about $30 in their jackets, Beard said.

Thomas A. ‘‘Baner’’ Bane, university traffic control };
officer, said he noticed the youths after they walked out |,
of the Alumni House and headed for the bookstore. Bane
said he and Director of Security Michael L. Young
followed them out of the bookstore to outside Lee

Chapel, where one boy dropped a tape.

The two have been charged with petty larceny, Beard

said.

Young said many items have been stolen on campus
this year. The school’s trusting nature,

an easy target for local thieves.

‘Everybody just assumes that everybody else will act
honorably,’ Young said. ‘‘Everyone in town does not

abide by an honor code.

SAB checks in
$9,000 ahead

 

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

The Student Activities Board is
running $9,000 under budget so far
this year, according to a report given
to the Executive Committee Monday.

SAB Treasurer Susan Wootton told
EC members that a ‘‘tremendous
showing’’ at the Homecoming concert
featuring Squeeze brought in $7,000
more than expected.

Wootton also said SAB saved
money on security for Homecoming
and gained additional revenues from
beverage sales.

Wootton also attributes the surplus
to good attendance at the two SAB-
sponsored bands that have performed
in the General Headquarters so far
this year.

She said the savings, along with a
cut in the number of movies and
comedians the SAB plans to bring to
campus this year, has allowed the
organization to cut its projected bud-
get for the year from $62,000 to
about $53,000. The EC granted the
SAB $55,500.

In other business, the EC granted
$1,020 to Women’s Club Basketball,
bringing the EC reserve under $400.

Also, the EC this week announced
appointments to Fancy Dress positons.
Elizabeth Vallotton, ’92 was ap-
pointed chairwoman. Lewis Perkins,
93, was appointed vice chairman,
and Lanie Merryweather, '92, auditor.

STU donates surplus

 

By Missy Curtis
Staff Reporter

 

Extra money that has built up over
the years will be donated by the
Student Telephone Union to or-
ganizations in the W&L community.

According to STU Tri-President
Jason Jenkins, STU is obligated by
contract with Centel and Virginia
Power to keep a certain amount of
funds available to cover fees if stu-
dents default on their phone bills.

Tri-President Jason Robinson ex-
plained that even if a student de-
faults on his or her bill, STU is only
liable for up to $100.

“‘But under the Honor System,’’
Robinson said, ‘‘students pay their

he said, makes it

Bane urged students to report any suspicious activity

they observe to security.

‘‘When you see a non-student who doesn’t look like
he should be here, call security so we can check him out

immediately,’ Bane said.

bills pretty diligently.’’

Jenkins agreed. ‘‘Over the course
of three or four years, money builds
up due to successful operation,’’ he
said.

Robinson said STU currently com-
mands a budget of about $24,000.
This year, STU has already donated
approximately $1,000 to WLUR-FM
to replace outdated equipment. Last
year, $12,000 was given to Live
Drive to purchase a new van.

“It has been decided in the past to
donate the extra money to a worthy
organization that will help out the
W&L community at large,’’ Jenkins
said.

So far this year, STU has received
requests for donations from Mock
Convention and the Outing Club.

The Reeves Center has been a hot topic in the news lately because of
possible endowment. Meanwhile the existing building has gone largely
unnoticed by students.

The Reeves Center for Research and Exhibition of Porcelain and Painting
houses over 2,000 pieces of Chinese and European ceramic pieces and decora-
tive art. The Center opened in the fall of 1982 and according to its director,
welcomes thousands of visitor each year.

“The Reeves Center is not a museum, it’s a research center,’ James
Whitehead, director of the center said. Whitehead has been the director since
it first opened and was greatly involved with initial acquisition of the 18th,
19th, and 20th century ceramics given to W&L in 1967 by Mr. and Mrs.
Euchlin D. Reeves of Providence, R.I., which makes up 98 percent of the
center’s collection.

“Interns and work-study students at the Reeves Center have a chance to
leam how to research pieces from scratch,’’ said inter Ulysses Hui.
According to Hui, work-study students and volunteers learn to research pieces
and apply those skills to a project.

‘‘The center gives people a chance to learn about art that you don’t get
anywhere else on campus,’’ junior Amanda Stewart said. According to
Stewart, though her intended major is politics, she chose the Reeves Center
as her work-study assignment because of her interest in art.

Whitehead said the majority of the work-study students are not art ma-

jors but have a strong interest in art.

Administrative Assistant Jeanna Chapman said Mr. and Mrs. Reeves
collected most of the ceramic pieces during their 25 years of marriage. The
center’s collection is especially rich in Chinese Export porcelain. Their most
spectacular piece is the ‘‘Hong’’ punch bowl which was made between 1785

‘‘Many contributors like to donate pieces to a center such as ours, be-
cause they would be used for research and not just looked at, as in a
museum,’’ Chapman said. ‘‘The students and volunteers learn the way
collectors would learn.’’

Whitehead said he has also spent many years trying to bring the art
world’s attention io the work of Mrs. Reeves, who as an artist is known
either by her maiden name, Louise Herreshoff, or Louise Eaton, after her first
husband. She stopped painting in 1927 after the death of her biggest
supporter, Aunt Lizzie. Chapman said Whitehead rediscovered Herreshoff’s
work accidentally, when the university first received the Reeves’ gift.

Chapman said her later paintings are reflective of her visits to Europe and
have won critical acclaim. ‘‘She has been called one of the leaders of post-
impressionism in America by renowned critic, William Gerdtz,’’ she said.

There are five major exhibition rooms in the two story center. These
include Chinese export porcelain for the American markets, Chinese export for
the English and continental markets, English ceramics, European ceramics, and
German porcelain. Herreshoff’s work is dispersed throughout the Reeves
Center. The armorial service that pictured the coat of arms of many
American patriots can be found in the center as well, including that of the
Lee family.

Tours and visits are available Monday through Friday between 10:30 a.m.
and 2:30 p.m. Please call 463-8744 for an appointment. There is no charge
for admission. For Parent’s Weekend the center will be open 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
friday and 9 a.m. to 12 p.m Saturday.

“Unless by word of mouth through students that work here, students
don’t ever know the Reeves Center exists,’"’ Chapman said.

ot. Joan helps the poor

 

By Jameson Leonardi
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee theater dep-
artment kicks off the 1991-92 season Thur-
Sday with Bertolt Brecht’s play St. Joan of
the Stockyards.

The play, which features a cast of 17
W&L students and one alumnus, presents a
case for simple, human values, said J.D.
Martinez, associate professor of drama at
W&L and the play’s director.

“I was getting tired of everything being
judged on economics,’’ Martinez said.
‘Money seems to be the only thing people
value. This play addresses the fact that
there are things of value other than money.”’

Martinez said that the play, which is set
in the Chicago stockyards, revolves around
a character similar to Joan of Arc. In the
process of attempting to help the poor, she
discovers the the inadequacy of religion and

then dies, Martinez said.

“It’s a play dealing with an immoral
economic system," Martinez said. ‘‘It can be
either communism or capitalism. It shows
that people in power are contemptuous of
those beneath them.”

Juniors Erin Walsh and Rich Cassone
will play the lead roles of Joan and Maul-
er.

The three- story set designed by senior
Macon Miles is the largest yet to be used in
a Lenfest Center production.

For additional effect, Larry Stene, as-
sociate professor of art, created 14 paintings
for the set.

“They are huge sculpted paintings of
slabs of meat and cows’ heads,”’
tinez. ‘‘They add a certain mood to the
set.”

The play will be presented in the Len-
fest Center’s Johnston Theatre on Nov. 1, 2

said Mar- §

7 and 9 at 8 p.m. and Nov. 3 at 2 p.m.

Dream comes true for Boreyko

 

By Jennifer Latham
Staff Reporter

 

Several local musicians will ex-
perience the Russian interpretation of
their music when Soviet conductor
Anderey Viktorovich Boreyko leads
the Washington and Lee University-
Rockbridge Symphony Orchestra in a
concert on Saturday at 8 p.m.

Dr. Barry Kolman, who is a
W&L music instructor and the con-
ductor of the URSO, said the visit
has been in the works for more than
a year and a half. A New York
agency that helps coordinate conduc-
tor exchange programs linked Kolman
with Boreyko. Kolman will conduct
Boreyko’s Ural State Philharmonic

Symphony in November.

Saturday’s concert will kick off
the orchestra’s fifth season. According
to Kolman, the URSO tries to get at
least one foreign conductor each year,
according to Kolman.

He said the group already has
guest conductors from Czechoslo-
vakia, Romania, Israel and Australia
lined up for the next several years.
He added that last year’s guest,
Brazilian conductor Florentino Dias,
is eager to return.

The URSO, which is comprised of
high school or college students and
local musicians and professionals, is
slightly smaller than Bereyko’s or-
chestra in Svedlovsk. Bereyko has
also. guest-conducted _— various
symphonies in his native country and

in Greece, and
Germany.

Kolman said securing Boreyko as
this year’s visiting conductor was
very exciting because such exchange
programs have not been possible in
the Iron Curtain countries before.

‘‘This is a brand new thing, not
just for musicians. Five years ago
many Soviets never thought they
would leave the country,’ Kolman
said,

Kolman said members of the
orchestra will not only experience
Bereyko’s interpretation of their
selected music, but gain a little
knowledge of soviet attitudes toward
the United States.

“Tl have a few students in the
orchestra who want to talk to him in

Italy, Turkey,

Russian,’’ he said.
He added that Bereyko’s ‘‘first

before Parents

For the kids:

1. DO hit your parents up for money. They're at their
most vulnerable this weekend.
2. DO get your hair cut before your parents arrive. If
they can recognize you as their offspring, they'll
probably give you more money.
3. DON’T forget to clean your room. Especially pick
up the month-old pizza boxes and hour-old beer

4. DON'T take your parents to class Friday morning.
Your parents will be the only ones there, and then
you'll all look like geeks.
5. DON'T let your parents pick you up for breakfast
on Saturday or Sunday morning. Tell them you'll
meet them there -- and make it brunch.
6. DON'T introduce your parents to any close friends
who don't have parents in town. Your friend will feel
free to embarrass you with stories about all the really
stupid things you've done in the past seven weeks.
7. DO ask your “(in)significant other’ about what's
okay to say around his or her parents.

Weekend do’s and don'ts
For the folks:

1. DON'T call your son “Binky” or other embarrassing
names in front of his friends.

2. DON'T tell the professors about how smart your
child is. Most of them won't believe you anyway.

3. DON'T bring back your son's favorite stuffed
animal or security blanket he left at home this fall.
4. DON'T call your son/daughter early Saturday or
Sunday morning. Chances are, he’s not in. (We'll let

them explain why.)

5. DON’T be nervous about your son's pledgeship.
It really is a growing experience.

6. DO stock the refrigerator for your kid. He/She
hasn't eaten a decent meal in weeks.

7. DON'T believe your child's room is always that

8. DON'T look in the closet.

9. DO give your child money. Lots and lots of money.

Parents converge
for 37th Weekend

 

By Jameson Leonardi
Staff Reporter

 

Parents from all over the country,
anxious to see their kids for the first
time in weeks, will converge on the
Washington and Lee campus this
weekend for the 37th annual Parents’
Weekend.

According to Chris Dieghan, assis-
tant director of development for infor-
mation services, 784 families have
pre-registered and 1,699 people are
expected to attend.

“A lot of families don’t register,
however,”’ Diegan said. ‘‘We really
expect more than 1,699 people to
attend,’’

A wide variety of activities have
been planned for the parents. Among
them are three concerts and one play
to be performed in the Lenfest Cen-
ter.

On Friday at 4 p.m., the Women’s
Chorus, Glee Club, Jubilee, and Sout-
hern Comfort will join with the Uni-
versity Wind Ensemble for a concert
in the Lenfest Center’s Keller The-
atre.

A second performance will be held
at 8:30 p.m. in the Keller Theatre
featuring the University Chorus,
Southern Comfort and Jubilee. They
will be joined by the University Wind
Ensemble.

According to music department
head Gordon Spice, this will be the
first year the choral groups and Wind
Ensemble will give two performan-
ces,

“All our concerts are now given in
the Lenfest Center, rather than Lee
Chapel,’’ said Spice. ‘‘The seating
capacity in the Lenfest Center is less
than it is in Lee Chapel, which cre-
ates the need for a second concert.”’

The University-Rockbridge Sym-
phony Orchestra will also perform in
the Keller Theatre on Saturday night.
Andrey Boreyko, the music director
of the Soviet Ural State Philharmonic
Orchestra, will be the guest conduc-
tor.

The Washington and Lee theatre
department will begin performances
of St. Joan of the Stockyards on
Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. and on
Sunday at 2 p.m. in Lenfest’s John-

son Theatre. The. play features 17 |

sentry my

W&L students and one alumnus.

Several athletic events are also
planned for the weekend, including
the annual Parents’ Weekend football
game. W&L, currently 0-7, will meet
Bridgewater College at 1:30 p.m.
Saturday on Wilson Field. Bridge-
water comes to Lexington 1-6,

Head Coach Gary Fallon said he is
expecting an exciting game.

‘Bridgewater is always tough,”’
Fallon said. ‘‘You can expect a very
rough game with lots of hitting.’’

The W&L Rugby Club also plans
a game for that afternoon. They will
play Longwood College at 12:30 p.m.
on the upper athletic fields.

In addition, several academic ac-
tivities are planned.

Many of the academic departments
will hold open houses on Friday
morning, and a special open house
for freshmen and their parents will be
held in the Lee House Friday after-
noon from 4-5:30.

University President John D. Wil-
son will deliver his annual report to
parents at 11:30 a.m. and again at
12:10 p.m. in Lee Chapel on Satur-
day.

Due to limited seating, those par-
ents whose names begin with A-M
are asked to attend the earlier session,
and the remainder are asked to come
at 12:10.

The Independent Union and Stu-
dent Activities Board will sponsor a
wine and cheese party for students
and their parents on Friday in Fairfax
Lounge from 7-10 p.m. The IU will
also sponsor a concert featuring Wild-
grass in Doremus Gym on Saturday
night.

The Minority Students Association
will sponsor an open house and rec-
eption at Chavis House on Friday at
7 p.m.

Freshmen expressed mixed feelings
about seeing their parents.

“‘Every day I forget a little more
just why I wanted to leave home,”
said Joyce Haynes from San Diego,
Calif.

Brent Avery from Marietta, Ga.
said he has mixed emotions.

‘*Parents’ Weekend will be inter-
esting,’ Avery said. ‘‘I’m sure
they’ll check my room in the middle
of the night to see if I’m drunk or
not.’’

Common Campus Colloquialisms

 

By Courtney Hall
Senior Copy Editor

 

Parents: you thought that the communication gap ended after puberty.

You assumed that as a mature, worldly college student, your son or
daughter would be able to communicate with you on an entirely new level.

But for the past seven weeks, your children have been busy either renew-
ing their mastery of or learning for the first time the intricacies of Wash-
ington and Lee lingo. (This may account for those low mid-term grades.)

In order to facilitate your weekend dialog, I’ve compiled the following
short list of commonly-heard campus colloquialisms:

* beat — an adjective that describes any unpleasant situation.
typically expressed in the phrase, ‘‘Awww, that’s beat.’’

« bummin’ hard — a passive verb that denotes serious distress; this phrase
is often heard resounding through the library late-night during mid-terms.

This is

"NS SORES GO ORE et
-* *
a! r é

vy Waals © ARES
ee ey 7 °3

¢ chafe — a noun referring to someone or something that rubs you the
wrong way. See road-cheese.

¢ did me wrong — this one is pretty self-explanatory, for example, ‘‘That
burrito at El Rodeo did me wrong.”’

¢ the Hill — refers informally to the main campus, but can also refer to
the administration; be careful to avoid ambiguous usage.

* maggot — this refers to your son if he is a freshman and a ‘‘new mem-
ber’’ of a fraternity.

¢ points — the absolute essential element to survival at W&L. These are
supposedly the equivalent of dollars; in effect, points allow students to eat
free. (This explains the survival of the menu at the Co-op.)

* road-cheese — refers to students from area women’s colleges. See chafe.

* score — action not restricted to the football team alone. (Ask your son.)

...That should be enough to get you through the weekend. Good luck,
and may your new knowledge serve you well.

Fraternity members confused by Renaissance regulations

Parsons said he understands the
students’ reactions.

“There are people living in the
[new] houses who are having to
adjust to a whole new level of expec-
tations,’’ Parsons said.

Many complaints from fraternity
members center around the univer-
sity’s inspections of their houses.

These inspections have resulted in
several fines for Phi Kapp, House
Manager Kevin Emerson said. He
said the infractions behind these fines
are often trivial.

‘*We’ve been charged a few times
for having ‘excess party dirt,’’” Emer-
son said. ‘‘What does the term excess
party dirt mean?’’

Lambda Chi junior Bill Donnelly
said the university has regulations for
every aspect in the house, no matter
how small.

‘*We actually had someone come
in and tell us our plants were in the
wrong place,’’ Donnelly said.

The university is simply protecting
its investment, Dean of Students
David Howison said.

‘The operational procedures were
designed to maintain the property in
a high standard and keep individual
houses responsible for [the houses],’’
Howison said. ‘‘We’re simply not
going to permit the houses to disin-
tegrate to the point they did 20 years
ago.”’

Emerson also said the fraternities
are supposed to be given 24 hours to
clean up after a party. However, Phi
Kapp has received fines the morning

after a party on two separate oc-
casions, he said.

W&L Assistant Construction Man-
ager Jim Boyd said he inspects each
house weekly.

“*My inspections are completely at
random,’’ Boyd said. ‘‘I don’t even
know when the parties are held.’’

Each fraternity does have 24
hours to clean its party room, said
Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins, associate
dean of students for Greek affairs.
However, the rest of the house must
remain clean regardless of the frater-
nity’s social schedule.

“The rest of the house is not
supposed to be messed up after a
party,’ Atkins said. ‘‘That’s why we
spent all this money to build such
nice party rooms.”’

Boyd said he sends a report
detailing the condition of each ren-
ovated house to Atkins, Howison, and
University President John D. Wilson.

Atkins explained that the univer-

stand,’’ Donnelly said. ‘‘{Boyd] will
just show up and tell you you broke
the rules.

“And the university, as far as the
administration goes, hasn’t been giv-
ing us any guidance at all,’’ he said.

Howison said the fraternities are
responsible for knowing the regula-
tions.

“It is a very systematic and regu-
lar system of accountability,’’ he said.
‘‘[The regulations] are there if people
want to take the time to understand
them.’’

Howison said fraternities can work
through their house mothers and the
Interfraternity Council to change any
regulations they dislike.

“We [the university] look to the
IFC for guidance,’’ Howison said.
“The IFC has real authority here.’’

Fraternity members living in the
renovated houses should be thankful
for their new houses, Sigma Nu
House Mother Beverly Coxey said.

 

‘And the university, as far as the ad-
ministration goes, hasn’t been giving us

sity does not actually levy fines.

“The university doesn’t fine any-
body for any infractions of university
regulations,’’ Atkins said. ‘‘The busi-
ness office sends bills to the house
corporations for any maintenance we
have to do beyond normal.’

Several fraternities also said the
system of regulations is complex and
bureaucratic.

Donnelly said the fraternity does
not know what it is allowed to do.

‘‘We don’t know where we

“Anyone can nitpick and find
problems,’’ Coxey said. ‘‘I don’t
think the boys realize the cost behind
renovating these houses.”’

But many fraternity men said they
find the problems with their new
houses to be more than trivial.

Paint started to bubble and cracks
began forming in the walls of Lamb-
da Chi only two days after members
moved back in, Donnelly said.

“We told the workers about the
cracks in the walls,’’ Donnelly said.

 

 

‘‘They said it was to be expected,
because everything was rushed for
completion.’’

Coxey said she thought hurried
construction led to several minor
problems in the Sigma Nu house.

Additionally, Phi Delt House Mot-
her Mata McGuire said that while she
is pleased with the way the house
looks, she thinks some of the sub-
contracting could have been better
supervised.

“It wasn’t our intent to accept
anything substandard,’’ Parsons said.
‘It is possible that something was
done substandardly. We depend on
the architects to tell us when all the
specifications have been met, and
sometimes they don’t catch everyth-

doors were kicked in or the posts

‘Any problem with the Phi Delt
bathroom resulted from misuse by the
brothers, not from faulty installation
or materials,’’ he said.

Parsons said work on some of the
houses didn’t meet specifications, but
these problems were promptly fixed.

“If the sinks [at Phi Delt] are
falling out now, it’s the Phi Delts’
fault,’’ Parsons said.

Several problems at the Sigma Nu
house have not been corrected, Presi-
dent Heath Dixon said.

He said the showers are clogged
about once every two months. Addi-
tionally, the toilets empty only after
they are flushed three times, and the
new fire-alarm goes off at least once
a week, Dixon said.

These problems can be easily
corrected with the replacement of
faulty parts, Boyd said.

Parsons said that problems with

eral contractor, have left some houses
with a few defects. But he said the

Hannah, Herring pace W&L in firs

 

By Jacob Kimball
Staff Reporter

 

The first-ever Washington and Lee
Invitational cross country meet was
marked by a solid team effort as the
Generals placed their top five runners
in the top nine overall to clinch a
first place team finish.

In the six-team field, W&L’s
overall score came to 25. The next
competitor was Eastern Mennonite
with 45 followed by Mercyhurst,
Bridgewater, Hampden-Sydney, and
Randolph-Macon.

The top four finishers for the
team all ran the course in personal
record time. Junior Bo Hannah's time
of 27:08 secured first place overall
for him. Senior Charles Edwards was
strong again, finishing second overall
in 27:34.

The team ran without junior Keith

Rinn, a consistent third-place finisher,
but the Generals did not lose a step.
Senior Lee Parker stepped up to
finish sixth overall and third for the
team with a time of 28:56.

The top five was rounded out by
Matthew Brock in 29:03 and David
Phillips who recorded a time of 29:51
as they finished seventh and ninth
overall, respectively.

Also turing in personal bests
were Frank Martien, Justin Peterson,
and Larry Hautau.

Coach John Tucker was thrilled
with the number of personal records.

‘‘We ran with greater intensity
this week than in any previous
meet,’’ he said.

However, he is hoping that the
team can tum up the intensity yet
another notch for the upcoming meet
with H-SC and EMC. The meet will
conclude the regular season as the
Generals hope to ride into the Old

Dominion Athletic Conference cham-
pionship meet at peak condition.

Although still hindered by injuries,
women’s cross country coach Jim
Phemister felt that the team gave its
best effort of the season in the W&L
Invitational.

Without four solid runners the
Generals finished third out of eight
teams, behind Dickinson and EMC.

The results were different from
the recent meets with different run-
ners filling out the top five, but the
team’s top runner remained the same.
Freshman Kim Herring paced the
Generals again, finishing sixth over-
all, but this time she did so in record
fashion. Her time of 21:23 surpassed
Paige Cason’s record time of 21:49
set in 1987 for the fastest run by a
General on the home course.

Helping lead the way was Nicole
Casteel, who finished at 22:06 and in

t Invitational

eighth place overall finish. Both
Casteel and Herring shaved over a
minute off of their previous times on
the course.

Despite the work of the regular
top finishers, the improvement came
from the runners who stepped up to
fill the shoes of those who were
sidelined. Brandi Henderson, Amy
French, and Deirdre Denechaud chop-
ped their times considerably as they
clinched the third place finish by
coming in third, fourth, and fifth,
respectively for W&L.

The Generals return to the course

this week against EMC in
Harrisonburg, Va. W&L hopes to get
everyone healthy for the Old

Dominion Athletic Conference meet
that is two weeks away. W&L is the
defending ODAC champion.

Run and shoot falls short vs. Sewanee

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

When you haven’t won a game
six weeks into the football season, it
doesn’t hurt to throw caution to the
wind. Or a lot of footballs.

In last Saturday’s game at
Sewanee, the Washington and Lee
football team scrapped its familiar I-
formation attack and went with its
own version of the run and shoot
offense.

‘*We hadn’t spent a whole lot of
time on it,’’ said head coach Gary
Fallon. ‘‘But it upset Sewanee’s
defensive rhythm and allowed us to
move the ball up the field and get a

Although the Generals effort came
up short on the day 21-13, the of-
fense showed an ability to control the
ball for extended periods of time for
the first time this season. That came
as a relief to the defense.

“It was a great confidence builder
for the defense,’’ said defensive end
John McCallum, who had a team-
high 16 tackles. ‘‘Watching the of-
fense move was worth its wait in
gold. Even though we didn’t get long
rests because the run and shoot
moves quickly, there’s nothing like
the good psychological lift watching
the offense move.’’

W&L went to the run and shoot
in the second quarter with freshman
quarterback Geren Steiner. At the end
of the game, Steiner had thrown 50

passes, completing 27 for 203 yards.
His favorite target was classmate
William Propst, who caught 12 passes
for 114 yards.

W&L trailed 14-0 before the
special teams got the Generals on the
board. Freshman Michael MacLane
returned a blocked punt for a touch-
down, cutting Sewanee’s lead to 14-
7 at the half.

After the Tigers scored to make it
21-7, Steiner tried to rally the Gen-
erals. He capped a long drive with a
14-yard scoring pass to Propst to
make it 21-13, but he could bring the
Generals no closer.

‘‘The offense caught fire and had
some success,”’ said Fallon, ‘‘and that

second half.’’

Next up for the Generals, 0-7 on
the season, is Old Dominion Athletic
Conference rival Bridgewater. The
Eagles come into the game 1-6 over-
all. Both teams are looking for their
first ODAC win.

Bridgewater is one of W&L’s
fiercest rivals, and some bad blood
exists between the schools.

McCallum said the rivalry goes
beyond bad blood.

“It’s pure hatred,’’ he said.
‘They hate us and we hate them.
And neither team wants to finish at
the bottom of the ODAC. It will be
a fight.’’

 

 

SPORTS NOTEBOOK

 

 

 

From W&L Sports Information

 

The Washington and Lee vol-
leyball team suffered a tough loss
in its final regular season match
on Wednesday.

Hollins topped W&L 15-13,
15-12, 16-14 to drop the Generals
to 10-20 on the year. W&L led in
each of the three games.

The loss drops W&L, 3-7 in
conference play, to eighth place in
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference. The Generals will host a
first round tournament game on
Nov. 5.

The loss soured W&L’s four-
game win over Sweet Briar on
Thursday. W&L topped the Vixens
15-6, 15-8, 9-15, 15-4.

W&L was led during the week
by senior Mena McGowin. Mc-
Gowin’s 19 kills put her over the
200 mark for the third straight
year.

Polo dunks H-SC twice

 

By Andrew Fox
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington & Lee water
polo team continued its domination
over Hampden-Sydney this past week-
end while tuning up for the Southern
Conference Championships.

Due to the cancellation of the Fall
Classic two weeks ago, the Generals
scheduled two matches against Hamp-
den-Sydney to prime themselves for
the remainder of the season.

In the first match, held at Hamp-
den-Sydney on Tuesday, senior Alan
Herrick and freshman Tony Diederich
combined for three goals apiece to
pace the Generals’ attack in an 11-6
victory.

As has been evident all season,
the reserves rose to the occasion and
preserved early leads in both games
against the Tigers. Freshman Derek
Devries contributed two goals in the
first game while reserve goalie
Michael Flippen looked strong in the

 

Twombly Pool on Friday, the Gen-
erals received two goals each from
Herrick, John Kannapell, Greg Golub
and Andrew Pearson to cruise to a
10-8 win.

In addition to the strong offen-
sive play, Remillard was encouraged
by the play of goalies Flippen and
PJ. Waicus.

“Our goalies’ confidence is re-
turning,’’ he said. ‘‘They have to
focus on blocking future goals instead
of worrying about goals that have
gotten by them.”’

Such confidence will be a must to
subdue the potent offenses the Gen-
erals will face at the Southern Con-
ference Championships.

Despite being ranked third in the
field of five teams, the Generals feel
they will be an aggressive underdog
when they match up against rivals
Arkansas-Little Rock and Richmond.

weekend,”’ said Kannapell. ‘‘We fecl

ATHLETIC CONFERENCE SOCCER TOURNAMENTS

Murphy-led men steal 3-1 win from H-SC

 

By Sean O’Rourke
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer team is off to the semifinals
of the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference tournament.

The Generals earned a four-hour
bus ride to Virginia Beach, Va.
where they will tangle with the na-
tion’s second ranked team, unbeaten
Virginia Wesleyan.

W&L will take the field with a
modest four-game winning streak.
The Generals’ most recent conquests
came over Lynchburg, 4-2, and
Hampden-Sydney, 3-1. The win over
Lynchburg clinched the Generals
home field advantage in the first
round of the ODAC tournament, and
the win over H-SC came in the first
round of the tournament.

The Lynchburg game was yet
another gutsy come-from-behind vic-
tory by the Generals in a season of
come-from-behind wins. The team
found themselves down 2-0 before
senior Winthrop Allen scored on a
pass from classmate David Hooker.
Allen’s goal cut the Hornets’ lead in
half and gave W&L some momentum
heading into halftime.

The offense exploded in the
second half and took the game away
from upset-minded Lynchburg. Soph-
omore Dan Rhodes tied the game
with an unassisted goal. He then
assisted on the game-winner scored
by junior Kyle Fanning a few min-
utes later. Reid Murphy closed out
the scoring barrage with his team-
leading sixth goal of the season.

‘“‘T saw a lot of character out
there,’’ said head coach Rolf Pir-
anian. ‘‘We hung tough, there was a
lot of fight in the kids, and it was a
great comeback.”’

The win gave the Generals a
home game in the first round of the
tournament, and the Generals didn’t
disappoint their fans.

Despite a scoreless first half, the
Generals dominated H-SC, controlling
the action throughout.

W&L’s offense got some help
from the H-SC defense. The Tigers
gave the ball away twice in the goal
box, and the ever-present Murphy

When the goalie misplayed a high

to reclaim the lead. W&L iced the
game a few minutes later when Mur-

feed from freshman Sam Drennan,

and knocking it home as he collided
with the goalie.

Piranian seemed pleased with his

team’s overall effort.

ODAC rematch vs.

 

By Sarah Gilbert
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee
women’s soccer team shut out
Sweet Briar 2-0 Wednesday in the
first round of the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference tournament,
setting up a rematch of last year’s
championship game.

This time, though, W&L and
Roanoke will play in the semi-
finals, Friday afternoon at Lynch-
burg. The Generals are this year’s
top seed, while Roanoke is the
defending champion. The teams
played to a 0-0 tie earlier this
year.

Senior Katie Seeman and
sophomore Corinda Hankins each
scored a goal early in the first
period to give the Generals the
lead, which they kept easily for
the remainder of the game.

‘We've had a good week,”’
said head coach Janine Hathorn.
“T felt like we were successful in
the ways we should have been.’’

With a 1-0 win over Messiah
Saturday and a 4-0 decision over
Sweet Briar last Thursday, the
Generals clinched the ODAC title
and brought their regular season
record to 7-4-2 overall and 6-1-1
in ODAC.

“IT was proud of our play,”’
said Hathorn. ‘‘It’s fun when you
execute well.’’

Against Messiah, sophomore
Aspen Yawars chalked up the
lone goal in the early minutes.

‘We played a strong team in
Messiah,’’ said Hathorn. ‘‘Some-
times when you work hard you
get lucky.”’

impressive 4-0 win over the Generals
two weeks ago.

Despite the tough challenge, Pir-
anian is very optimistic.

‘*We're excited for the rematch,”
he said. ‘‘I think it comes down to
us being prepared to play our game a
little bit better than last time. We
need to approach it as a team.”

2-0; earn
Roanoke

She commended senior Nancy
Mitchell and sophomores Allison
Lewis and Karen Stutzmann, who
“really played well.”’

Sweet Briar was overcome
easily with goals by senior Mor-
gan Warner, junior Andrea Car-
damone, Stutzmann and freshman
Amy Jefferson.

“The whole team is playing
very well,’’ Hathorn said. ‘*Some
of the fruits of our labor are
showing.”’

If the Generals are successful
against rival Roanoke on Friday,
they will return to Lynchburg on
Saturday to play the winner of
Randolph-Macon vs. Lynchburg
for the championship.

‘‘We feel deserving of our

security
to share
Safety info

By Pamela Kelley
Associate Editor

 

 

The Washington and Lee security
staff outlined two information-sharing
plans it hopes will make students and
other community members become
more safety-conscious.

According to a statement released
by W&L Security Director Mike
Young, information regarding crimes,
lost and found property, suspicious
persons, etc., will be posted on the
bulletin board in front of the Co-op.

Young said he also hopes to help
students become more familiar with
the security staff by having a security
guard on hand at the W&L library
for questions, concerns and com-
plaints at least once a week.

‘It will probably be me most of
the time,’’ said Young, who called
the library lobby his ‘‘Northern Out-
post,’ as opposed to Dean of
Students David Howison’s outdoor
“Auxiliary Office.’’

Young said the two programs
should begin some time next week.
Meanwhile, Young said students may

taken by security, like checking lock-

Young said he is looking into

Young said several Gaines resi-
dents have approached the university
about having all of the dormitory’s
doors locked at night. In the past few
weeks security has escorted an
average of six people home each
night. He also said lighting seems to
be a big concern among students.

Between 250 and 300 tickets have been sold
to couples for Saturday’s first-ever Mock
Democratic Convention Presidential Gala Ball,
according to MC Public Relations co-chairman
Talley Woolley.

“Everything is going really smoothly,’’ she

said. ‘‘There has been lots of student
enthusiasm.”’
According to senior David Bohigian,

coordinating chairman of the Gala, ‘‘The
purpose of the ball is to turn everyone’s
attention to Mock Convention. It’s an
awareness-raiser as well as a fund-raiser,’’

The Waller Family, a 50s motown band
that played at Fancy Dress in 1989, will be
playing at the Gala.

‘At Fancy Dress they played old good-
time stuff, everybody loved them,’’ he said.

The Gala is scheduled to be held in the
Warner Center from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. Bohigian
said the gym will be decorated to reflect a
presidential inaugural ball-type theme with red,
white and blue bunting, banners, flags of the 50
states, balloons and flowers. A live donkey will
greet dance-goers at the door, he said.

Tickets for the Gala will be on sale
Thursday evening in the MC office in the
University Center, and at the door Saturday
evening.

IFC adds new

publicity fee

By Maureen Levey
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Interfraternity Council passed a motion Tuesday
night to charge all members of fraternities a $10 fee to
pay for IFC publicity and to partially fund a speaker on
campus.

The money will be used to pay for a speaker to be
co-sponsored by Contact and for publicity such as
Springfest and the IFC newsletter.

Tuesday’s 8-7 vote confirmed the preliminary ap-
proval the board gave for the fee last week.

Also last week, Associate Dean of Students for Greek
Affairs Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins distributed to each
fraternity its freshmen’s midterm grades, but refused to
release a ranking of all houses.

He said sometimes midterm grades do not accurately
reflect students’ work and that there was no point in
comparing grades among fraternities.

NOVEMBER 7, 1991

Pub Board votes
for new magazine

 

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

The Publications Board Monday night voted
to create a new monthly news magazine for the
Washington and Lee campus.

The magazine will be funded by student
money, and its editors will be chosen each year
by the Pub Board. It will be ‘‘a magazine with
longer in-depth articles and a clearly defined
opinion section,’’ said Tonya Yoder, Ariel,
editor and Pub Board vice president.

The decision to create a new magazine arose
from an application by The Traveller magazine
to join the Pub Board and be recognized as an
official student publication. The board voted not
to recognize The Traveller, which published its
first two issues last spring as an independent
venture, and instead voted to create the new
magazine.

Debate over The Traveller's application
centered on whether the first two issues showed
a political bias. The Pub Board cannot recog-
nize publications with ‘‘a political or cultural
ideology,’’ according to its constitution.

The charter drawn up by editors of The
Traveller and presented to the board called for
“‘presenting the varied opinions and ideologies
of our community’’ in order to encourage ‘'‘li-
vely debate and tolerance of others’ views.’’

Matt Jackson, an editor of The Traveller,
pointed to the magazine’s ‘‘Point Counter
Point’’ section, which presented two opposing
views on an issue as evidence that the mag-
azine was ‘‘politically neutral.’’ However,
Executive Committee Rep. Josh MacFarland, an
observer at the meeting, said feature articles on

   

‘‘the biased media’’ and animal dissection made
The Traveller look like'‘the archenemy of the
Spectator,’’ an independent conservative mag-
azine.

Heidi Traulsen, Calyx business manager and
Pub Board member, said that regardless of the
editors’ intentions for this year with the new
charter, The Traveller was already ‘‘seen as
liberal by the campus’’ and thus should not be
recognized by the Pub Board. '

After the board voted not to recognize The
Traveller, discussion turned to whether or not
the campus needed a magazine to serve as a
forum for independent opinion or in-depth re-
porting articles. Yoder said she would like to
see a magazine with articles that ‘‘go into more
detail than The Ring-tum Phi’’ in reporting
campus events but which also features ‘‘int-
ellectual debate’’ on two sides of an issue, like
the ‘‘Point Counter Point’’ section of The
Traveller.

Phi editor and Pub Board member Jason
Kelley said that if the board was looking for a
publication with ‘‘a staff of reporters that goes
out to report the news and where people can
write in and express their opinions, then I
submit to you that we already have that in the
Pri

When brought to a vote, Ariel, Calyx, and
Journal of Science voted that there was a need
for a new publication, while the Phi voted no.
The Pub Board will accept proposals for the
format of the new magazine at its meeting
Monday.

The Traveller editor Jackson later said that
“‘what was accomplished was good’’ because
“the fundamental vision of The Traveller is
preserved.’’

Co-op extends hours

Washington and Lee students will soon
have an extra hour to buy late-night snacks.

Starting Nov, 10, the Co-op will close at
midnight Sunday through Thursday for the rest
of fall term, Night Manager Marcy Brown said.

Several students asked W&L Food Services
to keep the Co-op open, because students often
study late in the evening, she said.

The number of people working during the
last hour will be reduced from about six to

three, Brown said.

Many of the Co-op’s student employees
said they are unhappy about the new hours.

“‘T know working an extra hour will hurt
my studies,’’ student employee Nicole May-
field said.

While the grill will close at 11 p.m., cold
sandwiches and snack foods will remain avail-
able, Brown said.

After December break the new hours will
be reviewed, Brown said.

‘*We’ll have to see if we’re making enough
money to offset the extra hour people will have
to work,’’ she said.

New magazine
has no future

The Publications Board voted Monday to proceed with
plans for a news magazine to serve the Washington and
Lee community, despite a sole vote in opposition from the
Phi. We urge the Pub Board to turn back from this dead-
end course before pouring money into a hopeless cause.

There are several reasons why a new student magazine is
infeasible; notable among them are staff and money needs.

Without underrating our own coverage, it is true that
recruiting staff has been difficult for the Phi. We have the
corer market on journalism majors, and the bulk of our
writing is still done by editors. From our own experience
we know there are not enough students prepared to make a
commitment to regular, consistent, quality reporting. And
even though the proposed news magazine would come out
only monthly, the articles would be more in-depth, requir-
ing even more time each month from reporters than we do.

In fact, the only capable student reporters not working
for the Phi are working for publications with ideological
biases or not working for student publications. If the for-
mer group is recruited for the new magazine, ideological
biases will not be absent in the news coverage, and the
magazine will default in its obligation to ideological neu-
trality, mandated by the Pub Board constitution.

The second big obstacle facing a new publication is
money. The Executive Committee is in no way capable of
funding another publication, especially this year with less
than $400 remaining for allocations. While independent
publications receive a good portion of their money from
donations, an ethical news magazine could not accept dona-
tions. Moreover, since we are in the midst of an advertis-
ing slump, we can safely say the prospects for community
businesses paying for a new publication with their ads are
bleak. Instead, advertising dollars would only be diverted
from other publications, the Phi and sports brochures for
examples, thus putting greater strain on other money sour-
ces, such as the student activities fund.

These factors will become evident if the Pub Board
pursues its current course in attempting to develop a stu-
dent magazine. But we object to the magazine for an even
more fundamental reason: there is no need for it.

The board expects the proposed magazine to cover issues

in greater depth than the Phi. But the Phi devotes propor-
tionally more space to important issues, such as campus
security and Fraternity Renaissance. And these longer, issue
stories are rarely read in full by students, so the in-depth
articles in the proposed magazine will have low readership.
Moreover, there are simply not that many deep issues
facing the campus. Who would read a five-page report on
potentially harmful cleaning fluids used by campus janitors?

Another of the board’s expectations from the magazine is
an opinion section. But the Phi prints every legible opinion
it receives on any issue, and still there are weeks, most in
fact, when there is not enough unsolicited material to fill
the opinion page. Who does the Pub Board expect to write
for the issue-specific opinion forum of the proposed maga-
zine?

The Pub Board representatives of Calyx, Ariel, and Jour-
nal of Science voted in favor of a new publication because
it seemed the American thing to do, a battle for free speech
in any form at any time. What they do not realize is that
there is no need to battle here; free speech already exists.
We do not argue that this campus could benefit from more
independent, ideologically-grounded voices. But a news
magazine under the auspices of the Pub Board does not ac-
complish that goal, is redundant in its purpose, and ul-
timately serves to hurt the student body by spreading money
more thinly.

MY VIEW
By F. Trent Merchant

 

I applaud this year’s staff of The Ring-tum Phi
for taking definite stands on important issues, but
recently the paper has overstepped the bounds of
fairness and taste in its treatment of Marcus Miller.
This is not a letter from one of Mr. Miller’s close
friends; rather it is a call for an end to the repeat-
ed attempts to destroy the dignity of a member of
the Washington and Lee community.

I do not know what transpired on the night of
August 5, nor is it my place to speculate. I do
know that the police department conducted a hasty
investigation and charges were brought against Mr.
Miller. Subsequently Mr. Miller, the common-
wealth’s attorney and the victim all agreed to a
plea bargain and sentence. Marcus Miller was
convicted of trespassing. Had there been evidence
of attempted rape or sexual assault, surely the
commonwealth’s attorney would have pressed for
conviction on such serious charges. The legal
system has done it job. But, with the hysteria fol-
lowing the recent sexual violence on campus, sev-
eral parties have looked for a scapegoat, and they

Cadet addresses
issue of rape

To the students and faculty of W&L:

The subject which I am about to discuss is
very delicate, yet I feel it needs to be addressed.
It concerns the recent incident between a W&L
woman and a VMI cadet. As a first classman
(senior) at the Virginia Military Institute, I would
like to first and foremost apologize to your entire
student body for this incident. Please understand
that the cadets of VMI are very sensitive to the
subject of rape. We take this matter very serious-
ly and in no way support this violent and aggres-
sive behavior. Finally, please keep in mind that
entire corps can not be responsible for one
individual’s actions. I understand that relations
between our two schools are tense. If anyone has
any suggestions about how we can strengthen our
mutual trust, please contact me or any other
member of the corps of cadets at VMI. Your
advice will be well received.

Thomas’ abilities
are not superior

To the Editor:

I apologize for this untimely writing, how-
ever, as I am no longer a student at Washington
and Lee, it takes me just a little longer to receive
my editions of the Phi. 1 would like to comment
on a recent letter concerning Clarence Thomas by
Frank Martien, '92, in the October 17 issue of
The Ring-tum Phi.

Mr. Martien said that ‘‘at a fundamental
level, those in Congress who oppose Thomas
have done so all along on political grounds, and
not for reasons of his lack of capability or
integrity.’’ I strongly disagree that Congressional
opponents of Thomas do not question his capa-
bilities.

To begin with, Thomas is the second young-
est justice ever to sit on the United States Su-
preme Court. The youngest person to sit on the
bench was Justice Douglas. Thomas, to para-
phrase a famous Texan, ain’t no Douglas. In fact,
Thomas has had only three years of experience
in the United States court system, and just one
year sitting as a judge.

The American Bar Association gave Thomas
the minimal rating of ‘‘qualified’’ concerning his
professional ability to serve on the Supreme

have unjustly found one in Marcus Miller. I am
thoroughly enraged that The Ring-tum Phi, Miss
Rebecca K. Parkins and any others — however
silent — are trying to paint Mr. Miller as a rapist.

The October 17 edition of the Phi was a rag
designed to drag Mr. Miller’s name through the
mud. The inclusion of his name in the front page
article about campus rapes was irresponsible and
unnecessary. It offered nothing to the story; if

Miller was not convicted.
Since when is someone
charged with a crime
automatically guilty?

anything, it detracted from the story because Mr.
Miller did not rape anyone. The corrections section
of the edition, which were no doubt printed in
response to Mr. Miller’s letter in the Phi, was
childish. It was designed to discount Mr. Miller’s
credibility and served as nothing more than a jour-
nalistic ‘‘I got you last!’’

And what about students such as Miss Parkins,
who, not satisfied with the justice of the legal sys-
tem, subscribe instead to the lynch mod mentality.

Court. Each of the current justices, and 95
percent of all the justices to ever sit on the
Supreme Court, have received the ‘‘highest’’
rating from the ABA. Additionally, the NAACP
rejected Thomas as a suitable nominee; the
ACLU approved him be merely one vote.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Tho-
mas’ legal reasoning presents problems. A tho-
rough reading of the articles Thomas wrote about
‘natural law’’ show internal inconsistencies and
faulty logic, not to mention the clear lack of
precedential value these beliefs tender.

Therefore, Mr. Martien, your assertion that
those who oppose Thomas do so on strictly
political grounds is clearly erroneous. The truth
be told, many people still believe that a justice
of the Supreme Court should be a person of
independent intellectual substance, not a puppet
of ideology.

Phi should base
cartoons in fact

To the Editor:

J. MacGregor Tisdale, in his article (October
24), states the obvious: meaning depends on
interpretation and interpretation is indeed ‘‘subj-
ective.’’ However, Tisdale’s interpretation of Tim
Molloy’s recent cartoon is so tendentious and so
feebly argued as to lack all credibility.

For example, he claims that:

‘In my interpretation of the cartoon in ques-
tion, the suitcase full of money represents pos-
sible foul play involving PACs. The inclusion of
Senator Kennedy’s name simply questions the
credibility of the Judiciary Committee member-
ship.”’

Why then is there no mention of PACs any-
where in the cartoon? If the cartoon was truly
intended to be interpreted in this way, it would
have been but a simple matter for Mr. Molloy to
scribble ‘‘PAC $’’ on the suitcase. But Molloy
chose specifically to label it ‘‘package,’’ and
Senator Kennedy is depicted as asking Hill, ‘‘Did
you get my package?’’ Thus, can any reasonable
person doubt that Molloy intended we interpret
the package as being sent by Senator Kennedy
alone?

Further, Tisdale states that:

‘Little was accomplished in determining
Judge Thomas’ ability to interpret the law.
Personal lives and family background have

fairly

as Miss Parkins asserts in her letter of October 24,
then she is by no means a lady. It is people like
Miss Parkins who truly jeopardize the sense of
honor and trust at Washington and Lee by playing
the roles of both judge and jury when they do not
know all of the facts. It is true that Mr. Miller was
accused of a crime infinitely more terrible than
breaking a window. But the students accused of
breaking windows are window-breakers, God
forbid, and though Mr. Miller was initially charged
with attempted rape, he was not convicted. Since
when is someone charged with a crime automati-
cally guilty?

The recent violent acts on campus have shock-
ed most of us. Some terrible things have happened
here recently but we shouldn’t make it worse by
sensationalizing the story (‘‘Campus in Crisis’
— do you get it, Phi people?) or by destroying
another’s dignity by portraying him as a deviant
(are you listening, Miss Parkins?). It is very easy
to rant and rave when one is angry or afraid, I am
very good at it. But instead of ranting and raving,
and condemning a man for a crime that the legal
system says he did not commit, let us be reason-
able and leave our fellow student alone — he has
been on trial enough.

  

relatively little to do with such ability.”

This is true only up to a point. As the author
rightly claims, ‘‘Oliver Wendell Holmes’ aris-
tocratic background and conservative ideology’’
were indeed irrelevant to his abilities as a Su-
preme Court justice. However, I sincerely hope
that Tisdale is not implying that the charges of
sexual harassment levelled at Thomas were in
any way irrelevant: although I believe them to be
false, it was clearly incumbent upon the Senate
Judiciary Committee to investigate fully any
accusations of illegality raised at Thomas, who
was shortly to be entrusted with the maintenance
of the rule of law.

It is indeed the prerogative of the cartoonist
to speculate on the issues if he so chooses; and
he enjoys, along with all other Americans, the
right to freedom of speech and expression under
the First Amendment. However, no one questions
the prerogative of the newspaper editor to choose
which ‘‘speculations’’ are published and which
are not. Molloy has a right to freedom of ex-
pression, but not to have his views automatically
printed in The Ring-tum Phi. Thus, by question-
ing the judgement of the editors in publishing
Molloy’s cartoon, one does not question Mol-
loy’s right to civil liberties; one simply questions
why such groundless, prejudiced and heavy-
handed (not to mention ineptly-drawn) cartoons
constitute worthy and penetrating satire. Good
satire is always based in fact — Molloy’s cartoon
was not.

Yours etc.,

To the Editor:

Recently moving to Lexington, I have visited
the Reeves Center and found it to be outstand-
ing. It incorporates a fantastic collection housed
creatively while maintaining a cultural and
learning center.

Without exception, the proposed Watson
Center will compliment the Reeves Center as
well as be an outstanding addition to the W&L
campus.

I wonder if Mr. Chapman has ever taken the
opportunity to actually visit the Reeves Center to
tour the exhibits and talk to the dedicated staff.

It would be a vital loss to W&L, and the
Lexington community as a whole, if the proposed
Watson Center has to relocate elsewhere.

Subway
coming to
Lexington

By Jennifer Mayo

Lexington is getting a Subway,
but not the underground-train type
you'd find in New York City.

The Subway in Lexington will be
part of the nationwide Subway fast-
food chain specializing in submarine
sandwiches.

According to Tom Godwin, co-
owner of the store being built in
Lexington, Subway is currently the
fastest-growing fast-food franchise in
the country.

‘The reason we picked Lexington
to open a new location is that it is
one of the only areas with a, large
number of university students that has
no Subway,’’ Godwin said. ‘‘Subway
tends to be very successful with
college students...and we might even
run an exclusive delivery service to
W&L and VMI.”’

Godwin said even when the
schools are not in session, the tour-
ism in Lexington should aid in year-
round success for the restaurant.

Godwin’s family already owns one
Subway location in Stuarts Draft, just
southeast of Staunton. He said if the
Lexington store is successful, they
might consider opening another Sub-
way in Buena Vista.

The Lexington Subway, which
will be located between McDonald’s
and the ABC Store, has been under
construction for five weeks and
should be completed this month,
Godwin said.

‘We would like to open the store
the Friday after Thanksgiving if the
construction remains on schedule,’’ he
said.

The purpose of the summer opera-
tion was to stop his body from dest-
roying its red blood cells. But it was
not completely successful, Leslie said.
While he lost the blood cells at a
slower pace, he said he still felt tired.

“Tt felt like I was a car running
out of gas,’’ Leslie said.

Leslie said he is taking medicine
his doctors believe will solve the
immediate problem.

Chronic leukemia affects the bo-
dy’s production of both red and white
blood cells, leaving the person ex-
tremely susceptible to infection. The
disease is treatable with medication
and mild forms of chemotherapy.

“If you have to have leukemia,
that’s to one to have,’’ Leslie said.

Leslie said he hopes to back in
January, at which time he said he
hopes his leukemia will be in remis-
sion.

‘‘From time to time I may have
some recurring problems, but I’m
optimistic about it,’’ Leslie said. ‘My

Student housing shortage
expected, city realtors say

 

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

The market for student rentals in Lexington this year
is tight and is likely to get tighter due to new zoning
restrictions.

Some Lexington realtors say that, like last year, there
are very few vacancies and they expect that number to go
down as houses which can now hold four people must
reduce that number to three.

‘‘We have one vacancy now where as last year we
didn’t have any,”’ said Mike Flint, an agent at Mays Real
Estate.

Pat Randolph, who handles student rentals for Herring
Real Estate, said she has ‘‘just one building left’’ with
vacancies left for this year.

At Baker Real Estate, Scott Baker said he has ‘‘quite
a few vacancies’ compared with last year, a situation he
attributes to the. Fraternity Renaissance ‘‘pulling people
out of the rental market’’ since more. people can live in
the fraternity houses. :

Most of the realtors say they think a recently passed
zoning ordinance which reduces the number of unrelated
people who can live together from four to three will

 

 

create a housing crunch, filling up the vacancies that have
been created by Renaissance.

‘*Personally, I think it will have the reverse effect of
city council’s intention. It will make the housing shortage
more intense,’’ Baker said.

‘‘Where there are four people now there will have to
be three. One person is going to have to find somewhere
else to go,’’ Randolph said.

Lexington City Councilman Sidney Brown said the
effect of the new ordinances ‘‘upon actual student housing
will be minimal.’’

The main purpose of the ordinance is to restrict city
council from granting permits in the future to allow more
than three unrelated people from living together.

However, Brown said the new law would have an
effect on current student housing.

‘‘Houses which currently have four people are only
grandfathered for as long as there are actually four people
there,’ Brown said. He said that once fewer than four
people live in a house, there. can. never be more than
three people again.

At the Oct.. 17 city council meeting, Mayor H.E. *‘B-
uddy’’ Derrick responded to concerns that the the or-
dinance would cut down the number of available houses
saying that vacancies in the city are abundant.

The Student Activities Board has
named Elizabeth Vallotton, Lanie
Merryweather and Louis Perkins to
head the Fancy Dress Steering
Committee.

FD Chairman Elizabeth Vallotton
said Fancy Dress will be later this
year, on March 27, due to the date of
Mock Convention three weeks earlier.

Vallotton praised the previous FD
Chairman John Flippen for his

excellent job in organizing and
managing people.

‘‘My personal goal this year is
not to exceed John’s level of
organization, but to at least attain it,”’
Vallotton said. ‘‘If I can do that,
then the rest will take care of itself.”

According to FD Auditor Lanie
Merryweather, this year’s goal budget
is $55,000-$60,000, with the biggest
expense allotted for the bands.

Vice-Chairman Louis Perkins will
not only be assisting Vallotton, but is
also taking charge of all supply
orders.

Broomall said. ‘‘] had to devote more
time to the process and ask more
questions to make sure I could justify
everything we did.

“I’ve created an extra step just in
the last few months,’’ Broomall said.
“I felt it was necessary to insert
myself in the process to make the
determination that the plan fit with
the intent of the programs, that there
weren’t any unnecessary extras in
there.’’

Among the ‘‘extras’’ felled by
Broomall’s budget ax were planned
improvements to Delta Tau Delta’s
basement. Delt House Manager Pat-
rick McCabe said the university re-
versed itself three days after agreeing
to a ‘‘final plan’’ for the house on
Sept. 30.

The Sept. 30 blueprints called for
basement improvements such as an
expanded party room, a new bar and
a new television lounge.

On the main floor, the Sept. 30
plans called for a wall to be extended
and the fireplace moved to create a
separate living room.

The school’s revised plan cut out
all these additions.

“The university explained that
they would not do anything that’s not

 

 

Broomall

absolutely necessary,’’ McCabe said.

He said the fraternity voted to
disapprove the school’s changes, but
the university has kept its position.

‘Basically, they’re adding a bath-
room,’’ McCabe said.

Broomall said that after inspecting
the Delt house he decided that the
proposed alterations were not needed.

“Unfortunately, in the basement
they had — to me — one of the best-
defined party areas,’’ Broomall said.
‘‘Thinking about cost, I didn’t know
what we were gaining by altering a
space already so well defined. It was
agreed that it wasn’t the intent of the
program to change spaces that are
already functional.’’

‘It all comes down to the dol-
lar,’’ Parsons said. ‘‘We could meet
the standards without spending that
much money.

‘The first goal of Renaissance is
to try to bring each house up to the
standards set by the IFC,’’ Parsons
said. ‘‘Secondly, we try to maintain
the individual character of each
house.”’

But this change in the planning
process is unfair to the fraternities in
the later stage of Renaissance, Jen-
kins said.

‘If you walk through the Phase I
houses, it’s obvious their criteria
wasn’t only what was absolutely
necessary to bring them up to stan-
dard,’’ Jenkins said.

Broomall said the aims of Renais-
sance have not changed since Phase
I.

‘‘The action I’ve inserted is con-
sistent with the program’s intent,’’ he
said.

‘{The houses] weren’t equal to
begin with and we’re not trying to
make them equal,’’ Parsons said.
‘‘We’re just trying to bring them up
to standard.”’

Broomall agreed, and said the
university is only trying to avoid
mistakes made in Phase I.

‘*There were a number of deci-
sions made by the contractor [in
Phase I] without our consent,’’ Broo-
mall said. ‘‘We had to remind them
that quality had to be achieved, but

not at any price.

“The first couple of houses might
have gotten some extras out of the
contractor that might not have flown
now,’’ Broomall said.

But the president of one of those
Phase I houseslso questioned the way
the university implemented the frat-
ernity’s suggestions.

“It’s hard not to be satisfied [with
Renaissance] because the difference
between living in the new and the
old house is like night and day,”’
said Beta Theta Pi President Kevin
Bauer. ‘‘But at the same time we
would have liked to have certain
amenities.”’

For example, Beta had trouble
getting | furniture and decorations
which it felt fit the house, said
Bauer.

‘The interior decorators had vis-
ions of the house which weren't
exactly our\ vision, and _ things
generally went their way until the
house mother came in,’’ Bauer said.
‘*But alumni are now donating some
money, so slowly it is becoming the
house we want it to be.

‘Looking back, I'd, say probably
about 70 percent of the time the
university was just listening to us and
not following our advice,’’ Bauer
said,

Another fraternity president, Lam-
bda Chi Alpha’s Shane Kimzey, said
the university agreed to build a stor-
age room for ritual equipment but
didn’t.

“We specifically asked for a
space to store ritual equipment,’’
Kimzey said. ‘‘On our last copy of
the plans, there is a big space labeled
‘storage,’ and we were led to believe
we'd be able to use it.

‘‘When they finished the house we
found [the storage room] was for jan-
itorial supplies, and it's [now] emp-
ty".

Kimzey said the university is
building a space for ritual equipment
now but hasn’t addressed the house’s
lack of overall storage space.

Kimzey also said Lambda Chi has
not received a basketball court and
porch swings the school promised.

Pi Kappa Phi, presently under
construction, saw all its rooms, in-
cluding the president's suite, changed
to doubles to hold more brothers plus
the house mother, said Pi Phi Vice

Delta Tau Delta agreed with the university on these “final”

“The house mother’s apartment is
knocking out our favorite room, but
we couldn’t get around it,’’ Potts
said. He said the university was coo-
perative throughout the process.

And despite some complaints from
other houses, several fraternity men
agreed with Potts.

Sigma Chi President Charles Ed-
wards said the school has cooperated
completely with his fraternity.

“Throughout the whole process
we've been aware they’re under fin-
ancial constraint, so we didn’t ask for
anything they’d have reason to turn

questioned the power the university
gave them in designing their own
houses.

‘We were asked our opinion and

changes without our knowledge,”’ Bill
Donnelly, a Lambda Chi junior said.

Parsons said that while he sym-
pathizes with fraternities that believe
they got short-changed, the university
can financially only do so much to
the houses.

‘There has to be some point
where we say, ‘This is it, if you
want to change it, change it on your
own time and with your own mo-
ney,’ '’ Parsons said. ‘‘And those
changes have to be approved by the
university.’’

Theater group tackles a critical issue

 

By Fran Kefalas
Entertainment Editor

 

No.

That’s all it should take, but that’s not reality.
Acquaintance rape is an actuality that everyone
must face.

On Monday, Nov. 11 the Health Education
Committee is sponsoring a play about acquaintance
rape called But I Said No. The production will be
presented by Offstage Theatre, a non-profit
organization based in Charlottesville.

The play is the brain child of Margaret Baldwin
and Doug Grissom. The Charlottesville Sexual
Assault Resource Agency approached Grissom last
September about using one of his plays for their
Tape awareness week. Grissom felt that the
production they inquired about was not suitable and
contacted Baldwin to collaborate on a new
production,

Baldwin said ‘‘we didn’t really know what was
going to happen with the play.’’ She added that the
play evolved from its original form as stage
readings into a full production last May.

Baildwin said the play consists of a ‘‘series of
monologues and voices. It’s not your typical play.’’

Associate Dean of Students and Counselor of
Psychology Anne Schroer-Lamont said that the
Opportunity to present the play came at a very
appropriate time.

‘For every stranger rape there are 10-20
acquaintance rapes,’’ said Schroer-Lamont. She
added that this is a subject that people need to be

aware of.

Schroer-Lamont said she ‘‘hopes the production
will attract upperclassmen as well as freshmen,”’
but she is afraid the subject will keep male viewers
away.

‘It’s not about male-bashing,’’ said Schroer-
Lamont. She added that it’s important for men to
see this play to help them understand what a rape
victim goes through because ‘‘in the recovery
process for any assault or rape victim men play an
important role. The victims need to be held and
cared for by a man they can trust.’’

“twe’ve had reactions from men who came with
their guard up, expecting to be bashed, and left
feeling that it was fair,’’ said Baldwin.

‘It’s not just a woman’s issue it’s a man’s
issue as well,’’ she said. ‘‘It’s important to create
a dialogue between men and women.’’

But I Said No consists of six performers, each
playing many characters telling different stories. It
allows the viewer to hear the voices of the
survivors, the assailants, and family members and
friends of the survivors. Audience members are
encouraged to identify their own feelings, attitudes,
and cultural stereotypes regarding acquaintance
rape.
Baldwin said that acquaintance rape is not a
clear cut issue, and by presenting many different
stories more people can relate to what is being
said.

‘‘There’s one section that deals a lot with the
myths of rape,’’ said Baldwin. She added that
“‘some sections are real rapid fire.’’

The play will start at 8 p.m. in the Keller

»

Theater of the Lenfest Center and will last
approximately 45 minutes. After the presentation
the company, some of whom are volunteers or staff
members of SARA will hold a discussion.

The discussion will be lead by Bambi Chapin,
a SARA staff member. All of the performers have
gone through an intensive one week sexual assault
training program.

The Health Education Committee has also
invited the V.M.I cadets, Southern Seminary
students and Lexington High School students to
view the production.

Sophomore Matt Hansen, the student in charge
of coordinating the events for the play, said ‘‘the
health education committee sees the play as having
a lot of potential good.”’

Margaret Baldwin is a graduate of the
University of Virginia and has written for and
performed in regional, community, university, and
children’s theater. Doug Grissom is head of
playwriting in the drama department at the
University of Virginia and is co-founder and co-
artistic director of Offstage Theater.

But I Said No is directed by Richard Warner, a
member of the acting and directing faculty of UVa.

According to Schroer-Lamont the production
has been staged at campuses all over the country
and was recommended highly by students who
have seen it elsewhere.

The Offstage Theatre Company is a non-profit
organization base in Charlottesville. When asked if
the company would be dealing with any other
controversial issue, Baldwin said, ‘‘Offstage is
open to anything that comes up.”’

new publication, as provided for in the Pub Board constitution.

The following are the procedures for Pub Board recognition of a new
student publication, from the Pub Board constitution:

“2. A proposed publication must fulfill the following minimum criteria to the satisfaction of the Publications
Board in order to be considered for recognition:

“a. A written mission statement for proposed publication
“b. A demonstration of how the publication would fulfill a campus need which is not or cannot be

“c. A proposed operating budget for the first two issues, included wherein: proposed size (no. of

 

pages, frequency of publications), list of contracted advertisers and other financial contributors [here, a list of advertisers

The Washington & Lee water
polo team secured the eighth seed in
the Eastern Championships after an
impressive showing at the Southern
Conference Tournament this past
weekend at Dayton.

Despite having to play four
matches in two days, the Generals
were able to maintain a high level of
play in victories over Hampden-Syd-
ney, Richmond, and Dayton. The
only loss was to eventual champion
Arkansas-Little Rock.

The Washington and Lee men’s
and women’s cross country team
finished the regular season ready to
make their respective runs at the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference titles.

The men’s team notched three
ODAC wins in the meet held at
Easterm Mennonite, beating Hamp-
den-Sydney, Bridgewater, and host
EMC to finish an undefeated 6-0 in
conference and 8-1 overall.

The women split with EMC and
Mary Baldwin but got a moral vic-
tory when two injured runners re-
tured to action.

Junior Bo Hannah finished first
overall in a time of 26:36 followed
by senior Charles Edwards who
finished second overall in 27:22.

Leading the women were Kim
Herring and Nicole Casteel; both
surpassed W&L’s record time on the
EMC course as Herring finished
second overall in 20:17 and Casteel’s
21:02 placed her fourth overall.

Senior Jodi Herring was in action
for the first time since early in the
season. Her return should aid the
Generals in their attempt to repeat as
ODAC champions.

Heading into the ODAC meet, the
women hope to be healthy as they
defend their title, and Hannah said
the men will follow their seasonlong
philosophy.

‘We are not going to worry about
any other team, but rather concentrate
on running the best that we can,’’ he
said, ‘If we run how we are capable
of running, we will win.”

The Washington and Lee vol-
leyball ran off 33 consecutive points
over the course of three games to
rout Randolph-Macon Woman's Col-
lege in the first round of the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference tourna-
ment.

The Generals tamed the Wildcats
in three straight games 15-2, 15-0,
15-2 to advance to the next round on
Friday at Mary Baldwin.

‘*We played well as a team,”’ said
head coach Susan Dittman. ‘‘They’re
a poor team, but we played well and

for nine steals in the 10-8 win.

The final two matches of the
tournament against Arkansas-Little
Rock and Dayton posed the greatest
test for the Generals. Against Arkan-
sas, W&L squeaked to a 5-4 halftime
lead thanks to two goals by senior
Will Davis. Despite playing the Tro-
jans even in the third quarter, the
Generals failed to score in the fourth
quarter and lost 11-9.

However, the scoring drought did
not carry over to the Dayton match.
Davis and Chris Hagge each scored
three goals to outscore the Flyers 11-
9. On defense, Waicus frustrated the
Dayton offense with 19 blocks, eight
of which came on man up scoring
opportunities.

‘‘Throughout the season, we’ve
had one player carry us. Last night
everyone came together.”’

The Generals led 6-0 in the first
game before R-MWC scored. The
Generals didn’t allow another point
until it was 9-0 in the third game.

W&L closed out the second game
when senior Mena McGowin ham-
mered down a spike and senior Mar-
cy Brown served an ace and an un-
returnable serve. The 15-0 win was
W&L’s first ever shut out win.

W&L’s balanced team attack was
led by McGowin’s six kills. Brown
and junior Leslie Hess each had five
kills and four service aces. Junior

The field of teams includes Slippery

are considered the underdog, intimida-
tion will not be a factor.

‘*We are not making the trip with
the intention of losing a game,’’ said
Remillard. ‘‘We are not intimidated

W&l will need the killer instinct

What is it about the Roanoke
women’s soccer team?

For the third time in as many
meetings, the Washington and Lee
women’s soccer team lost to
Roanoke by one goal in post-
regulation play, this time in a
battle at Lynchburg for the right
to play in the Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference championship
game.

“The problem we had against
Roanoke was the same problem
we had all year,’’ said coach
Janine Hathorn of the '2-1 loss.
‘“‘We couldn’t put the ball in the
goal, and if you don’t score, you
can’t win.’’

 

Junior Susan Moseley scored
the lone goal, and sophomore
goalie Kate Stimeling came up
with 19 saves.

There is an old adage that
says close but no cigar. The
Washington and Lee men’s soccer
team will look back on the final
two games of the 1991 season
and think of that adage.

In the semifinals of the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
tournament, the took the third-
ranked team in Division III to the
limit, losing a 1-0 heartbreaker to
Virginia Wesleyan.

“We played a real tough
game,’’ said head coach Rolf

Piranian. ‘‘We played as hard as
we could and we had some great
chances.’’

The Generals had to regroup
quickly from the tough loss to
take on VMI. It was another
tough loss for the Generals as
they fell to the Keydets 2-0.

The team had, however, a
number of chances that they
couldn’t convert into goals.

Piranian hit on one major rea-
son for the lack of offense.

“We didn’t develop team
chemistry this year. Injuries were
that main factor. We just kept
shuffling the line-up. Plus, we
were missing two vital players in
Mike Mitchem and Chase Davis
for most of the year.”’

With the two losses, the Gen-
erals finished the season with an
8-6-2 record.

Bridgewater’s Tim Runion breaks up a pass in the end zone
intended for W&L’s William Propst. Runion’s three interceptions
helped the Eagles top the Generals 29-7 last Saturday.

In smokescreen, BC
tops Generals 29-7

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

Despite a large Parents’ Weekend
tumout at smoky Wilson Field, the
Washington and Lee football team
fell to Bridgewater 29-7 to remain
winless on the season.

In the smoke from forest fires in
the area, Bridgewater took the ball
away from W&L six times, including
three straight interceptions by Tim
Runion, and the Eagles controlled the
ball for over 36 minutes to earn the
win.
The Eagles led 14-0 in the second
quarter when the Generals’ run-and-
shoot offense kicked in. On a fourth
down from the Bridgewater 39-yard
line, freshman quarterback Geren
Steiner found freshman Hayne Hod-
ges behind the Eagles’ defense at the
four-yard line.

After the 35-yard gain, junior
Wade Robinett bulled his way into
the end zone for W&L’s lone touch-
down on the day.

Bridgewater scored on its first
possession of the third quarter after
former Lexington High star James
Cooper took a pass to the Generals’

12 yard line. Two plays later, Freddie
Williams scored to make it 20-7.

The Eagles iced the game later in
the quarter with a 26-yard pass from
Williams to Mike Whittle.

In the second half, W&L tumed
the ball over on its last six posses-
sions, four times inside the Bridge-
water 20-yard line.

W&L’s run and shoot offense
clicked in the second half. Steiner
completed 22 of 44 passes for 181
yards. Freshman William Propst again
led the Generals in receiving, catch-
ing 10 passes for 83 yards. All of his
catches came in the second half.

Defensively, junior Don Dempsey
was in on 11 tackles and had an
interception. Junior Lyle Smith led
the way with 13 tackles. Freshman
James Maberry had 11, as did senior
John McCallum. Seniors Greg Kiehl
and Scott Williamson added 10 each.

Next up for the Generals is the
final home game on the season
against Guilford. W&L upset Guil-
ford last season 28-22. A W&L win
would keep Guilford from winning a
share of the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference title.

Kickoff is set for 1:30 p.m. W&L
is still looking its their first win.

SAC votes to support
new black fraternity

 

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

 

The Student Affairs Committee
voted Nov. 1 to support the propo-
sed re-establishment of Washington
and Lee’s chapter of historically
black fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha.

SAC President and Dean of Stu-
dents David Howison announced the
decision to the presidents of W&L’s
16 existing fraternities Thursday,
Nov. 7.

Howison said the decision reflect-
ed the committee’s commitment to
student self-determination.

‘*The SAC believes the interested
students have the right to try and
make this thing work,’ Howison
said. ‘‘We did not want to stand in
their way.”’

W&L had a chapter of Alpha Phi
Alpha in the 1970s, but it dissolved.
About 10 students asked the uni-
versity to look into reviving the frat-
ermnity, Howison said.

SAC, made up of faculty mem-
bers and leaders of student govern-
ment, has been discussing the issue
since May.

According to the Interfraternity
Council constitution, after a propos-
ed fraternity gains approval from
SAC, it must also be accepted by a
three-fourths vote from IFC.

Howison said SAC approved the
fraternity only after they were sure it
would be able to conform to the
IFC’s rules.

“SAC only considered it as a
social fraternity,’’ Howison said. ‘‘I

Meese praises Supreme Court

Former U.S. Attorney General
Edwin Meese III came to Lee Chapel

a Supreme Court he sees beginning
to leave behind the recent tradition of
judicial legislation.

chip away at Roe v. Wade, the 1973
decision legalizing abortion, as it has
in recent decisions.

‘Once they get in the legislating
business, they find they have to keep
going,’’ he said. ‘‘I suspect they’ll
nibble at the edges of Roe v. Wade
until they have one of the more clear
cut cases where they will have to go
to the root and overturn it.

“‘T just get the impression that he
was some sort of a sneaky charac-
ter,’’ said one junior.

As Attorney General from 1985-
88, Meese met with considerable
criticism and charges of politicizing
his office. He was twice investigated
by special prosecutors of Congress’
independent counsel, once for alleged

 

financial misdoings and once for the
Wedtech scandal involving Meese

ments. Meese was cleared of any
wrongdoing in both cases.

In a question and answer’ session

Che Ring-tum Phi

Founded September 18, 1897

 

Vote no on
Alpha Phi Alpha

The Interfraternity Council faces a decision on Alpha Phi
Alpha next week; its members know that. What they might
not know is that a vote for Alpha Phi Alpha could set race
relations on this campus years behind.

The desire for a new fraternity on the part of the petition-
ers is understandable. Only 21 of W&L’s 996 undergraduate
men are black. In an era when racism is far from absent at
W&L, those 21 men have a lot in common. And their num-
ber is often too small to muster a collective voice in campus
politics.

The fraternity in question is a good choice. Alpha Phi
Alpha is admirable for its achievements in the education of
black youths, high academic standards for its members, and
networking in the professional world. In that regard, it would
offer the fraternity system something it now lacks.

But the most important point in this debate is that Alpha
Phi Alpha will stall this campus’ movement toward bridging
racial gaps.

Alpha Phi Alpha provides only a temporary fix to the
problems of integration by creating a separate but equal
social outlet for black students. In the long-term, the frater-
nity will serve only to draw a clear line between black and
white. As students struggle to overcome racial stereotypes
and integrate socially, Alpha Phi Alpha will stand as an
obstacle, a monument to racism.

The IFC president argues that an IFC ruling against Alpha
Phi Alpha would violate the principle of student autonomy
by going against the wishes of the student petitioners. That
is nonsense. Should IFC hesitate in issuing Rush fines for
fear of violating the autonomy of offenders? IFC is exercis-
ing student autonomy in making a decision. If 612 fraternity
men tum down the petition of 10 students, that is not un-
healthy autonomy.

Many IFC representatives favor Alpha Phi Alpha because
they are in fact indifferent and do not want to go to the
trouble of opposing the new fraternity; that opinion is in fact
an attack on student autonomy. The IFC holds the power of
decision on this matter because the university trusts the
council to know the issue and do what is best. A council-
man’s failure to make an educated vote is a failure to per-
form as an elected fraternity official.

It will not be easy for any chapter to vote against Alpha
Phi Alpha. It seems presumptuous to disappoint the fellow-
student petitioners based on an educated estimation of future
events. But the right course of action is frequently the most
difficult.

W&L fraternities and students on the. whole are gradually
taking to integration. It is the nature of evolution, even
social evolution, that the process is slow. We must all be
patient lest today’s quick remedy become tomorrow’s poison.

Magic’s lesson
is for us, too

Magic Johnson’s announcement that he is infected with
the AIDS virus saddened many of us. It was painful to see
him issued the death sentence that is an HIV-positive test
result.

Unfortunately, many of us at W&L seem to have missed
the point of Magic’s announcement. He contracted the AIDS
virus doing something almost all of us have done before: he
had intercourse with a member of the opposite sex and did
not wear a condom. We kind of doubt many people on
campus have changed their habits as a result.

Surely, if a W&L student became infected with the AIDS
virus, people here would begin to think about protecting
themselves. Let’s just hope it doesn’t have to come to that.

Quote of the Week

They're into a lot of service and high academic standards,
not what we’ re used to.

The Ring-tum Phi is published Thursdays during the undergraduate
school year at Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia.
Funding for The Ring-tum Phi comes primarily from advertising, but
also from a portion of the student activities fee. The Washington and
Lee Publications Board elects the chief editors and business manager,
but The Ring-tum Phi is otherwise independent.

Letters and other submissions must be in the Phi office, Room 208
of the University Center, by noon on Tuesday to appear in that
week’s edition. This newspaper observes current court definitions of

Law students
demand changes

To Dean Randall P. Bezanson:

Given the recent racially intolerant incidents
centered at the School of Law, measures, both
reactive and proactive, must be addressed.

In the August 1991 letter Executive Commit-
tee President Giles Perkins distributed to the
(Law) Class of 1994, he says, ‘‘You may live,
study and pursue your goals in an atmosphere of
unparalleled freedom that is available to the
Washington and Lee community only because of
the Honor System.’’ He goes on to say, “‘...the
students are those who exemplify the highest
standards of personal integrity.”’

After eight weeks here, even the First Year
Law students know this is definitely not the
reality. What Washington and Lee offered was
the (seemingly) ideal microcosm where students
could leave their personal property at their
carrels without the fear of it being pilfered or
destroyed. No longer will we, as students, be a
victim to this myth. Last month, an African-
American student found on his/her carrel, a
message. The message was written on a picture

representing Black art which was of both sen-’

timental and real value. The item of personal
property was defaced and devalued. Moreover,
the message it gave was one full of hate and
bigotry: ‘‘NIGGER’S (sic) MUST DIE.”

This is a clear message to law and under-
graduate students of African/African-American
decent. It should also impact upon other minority
students at this institution that prides itself on ‘‘a
community of honor.’’ Such a blatantly racist
statement not only shot terror in the heart of the
recipient, it struck a chord in all of us. One who
is not a member of a minority group can only
begin to understand exactly how deeply occur-
rences such as this hurt. It is enough to know
that in this world, there will be people who
despise you simply because of the color of your
skin. When in an undergraduate academic setting,
this remains the prevailing reality. By the time
we reached the professional academic environ-
ment, perhaps we let our guard down. Really
now, how could we think that in a rigorous,
nationally-heralded law school, the racial climate
would be any different? We realize that it takes
just a few to spoil it for all. But hopefully, one
day, the entire student body, faculty and staff
will feel the harm members of minority groups
feel when such senseless and immoral acts occur.

In a February 28, 1991 letter from you, you
write, ‘‘Washington and Lee is a school that
takes seriously its obligation to your educational
training.’’ We hope to broaden that interpretation
of the word ‘‘educational.’’ Because the School
of Law is unique in its scope, it has the poten-
tial to affect positive change. Unfortunately, in
this incident of late, the appropriate authorities
may not find the perpetrator of the offensive act.
But, this does not mean that some beneficial
outcome cannot result.

Now is the time! The university can seize
this moment to educate and further enlighten the
entire community. It will take a great deal of
one-on-one interaction at the small-scale level,
but the long-range outcome is guaranteed to be
well worth the effort. The School of Law needs
to let the students know, definitively, that such
acts are not honorable and not in keeping with
the guidelines as provided by the university
student body in the Honor System pamphlets.
This is an opportunity to prove to the student
body that ‘*...mutual trust and respect form the
bedrock of relationships within the community.”’
The university has already mandated that this
ugly circumstance be dealt with effectively and
with forthrightness, ‘‘No violation of this trust is
too small to be ignored, for we understand that
honor is not measured by degree.”’

To assist the university in taking the steps
necessary to develop a truly honorable com-
munity, a community in which students of
diverse backgrounds (along with majority stu-
dents) can feel comfortable and flourish both
personally and professionally, we offer these
options:

1. Promote the recruitment and retention of
racial minorities as students.

2. Creatively and earnestly retain racial
minorities as teacher and scholars. These first
two points serve as examples/role models to both
majority and minority students. Their contribu-
tions would afford the entire university com-
munity the ability to be more open and respect-
ful of those different from oneself. Of the high-
est priority is to keep the single African-Amer-

 

LETTERS

ican male professor at W&L and attract at least
one African-American female professor, in the
hope that she would eam tenure here.

3. Celebrate the national holiday of the great
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday.
Forty-eight other states have adopted the long-
awaited holiday, as well as the majority of top
institutions. Should not W&L set an example to
its students by conceding that this individual
played a monumental role in the advancement of
race relations?

4. Hold mandatory seminars on multi-cul-
turalism, especially for the undergraduate com-
munity’s awareness. Given that Washington and
Lee has grown from the date of its founding, it
is necessary to ensure that the student body
grows culturally along with it. Educate and
expose the community to ideas, cultures, eth-
nicities and lifestyles that may be different from
their own. It is an obligation for teachers and the
administration to provide the students with the
useful skills that will provide them with the
means to function positively and effectively in
this cultural mosaic we call our world.

5. Allow the Black Law Student Association
to contribute to pre-orientation for minority

‘students. Not only is it beneficial.to hear from-

faculty and staff ofthe university, it would
provide an even deeper view of student life if
the minority faculty/staff and BLSA introduced
themselves or even conducted a portion of the
orientation.

6. Support the claims of honesty and civility
regarding the academic environment by harshly
quashing infractions thereof (expulsion). As it
stands, a letter to each law student’s carrel is
simply not enough. Because the carrel mail
system is flooded with many handbills and
flyers, utilizing this medium does not effectively
reach the student body. Our hope is that your
letter was merely a preliminary measure that will
be followed by a more assertive stance.

7. Encourage a remedy though there is not
always a perpetrator. In the recent case, the

offender has not been identified. This should not
mean that the Executive Committee’s ‘‘hands are
tied’’ nor the Confidential Review Committee’s,
There are ways to deter acts of racial hatred
other than punishing the offender. Promote
awareness at the classroom level with the careful
selection of topics ranging from history to
biology. Require that resident assistants devise
programs to encourage interaction between their
residents, whoever they may be. Other univer-
sities have an established multicultural cur-
riculum that is required not only for incoming
students, but also for students before they grad-
uate. This applies to the undergraduate campus
in particular. There are many schools around the
country after which Washington and Lee can
model their program: University of North Car-
olina at Chapel Hill, Brown University, etc...

With the vast resources we know are avail-
able outside of Washington and Lee, as well as
the resources listed in many of the recruitment
catalogs/brochures, we feel that all such options
can be adopted within a reasonably short amount
of time (one calendar year).

We hope that you will take these ideas
seriously and would like to thank you in ad-
vance for your time that will be spent on making
these above suggestions a reality.

Spectator editor
points out error

The following is an excerpt from a letter ad-
dressed to Charles S. Rowe of The (Frederic-
ksburg) Free-Lance Star. The author writes to
Rowe after a recent meeting offering updated
information. The letter concerns a change in the
1991-92 Catalogue.
November 12, 1991
Dear Mr. Rowe:
..Of far greater consequence than whether or
not any legal proceedings occurred whatsoever,

   

 

surrounds the latter half of the Spectator article
concerned with the suspension. In the 1991-92
Catalogue, the President’s power of suspension
has been radically redefined. It now reads,
“‘Students may be required to sever their connec-
tion with the university for a specified period of
time for non-academic reasons by the President
or by other disciplinary action as outlined in the
Student Handbook.’’ | read this as stating that
the President may suspend at will, and my
discussions with both the President and Dean
Elrod have served to confirm that analysis as
being absolutely correct and valid.

In my discussion with both the President and
Dean Elrod, they informed me that they were
totally unaware of the catalogue change until I
had brought it to their attention. Unquestionably,

they appeared embarrassed by what they describ:
ed as ‘‘an unauthorized change’ and told me
that the existing policy followed the previous
catalogue. Finally, they both said that some form
of public correction would be issued in the Phi.
I want very much to believe and accept both
their promise and the sincerity of their embar-
rassment. Ten days have passed since I first
brought this to the administration’s attention. But
no letter has appeared in the Phi. No public —
correction has been offered. In fact, to the best

-of my knowledge, nothing other than a denial of

the court settlement has been made to the facul-

Nearly twice the time has elapsed that Presi-
dent Wilson required ‘‘to lose faith in student
government’’ before suspending three students
last year and still there has been no action; no
acknowledgement of the error in the catalogue.

I want very much to believe and accept both
their promise and the sincerity of their embar-
rassment, but I find that I can no longer do so.

Whether or not the catalogue change was a
mistake, whether or not President Wilson was
aware of the change, and whether or not he
authorized it is absolutely immaterial. It is on
the books. If the administration wishes to change
that fact, they must issue a public correction. Of
course, I am no lawyer. But common sense
would dictate that they should issue a statement
to every student and each of their parents.
Furthermore, someone needs to justify to the
Board of Trustees exactly how such a radical
change could be implemented without administra-
tion or Trustee knowledge, much less approval.
Finally, the current procedures by which the
catalogue is written and edited needs to be
changed, perhaps under Trustee auspices, to
insure that an unauthorized change of such
monumental proportions never occurs again.

The President’s and the university’s reputa-
tions are at stake...

Cameron Humphries

Bikers banned
on Chessie Trail

To the Editor:

Since the opening of the Chessie Nature Trail
in 1981, the usage regulations have prohibited
vehicular traffic along the route and signs at
each entrance to the trail have made that policy
clear.

Recently, many bikers have begun using the
Trail. The VMI Foundation, Inc., which owns
and manages the facility, has received a number
of complaints from pedestrian patrons. As a
result, we must more stringently enforce the
‘pedestrians only’’ regulation. We are contacting
a number of groups who regularly use the
Chessie Trail to ask for their cooperation on this
matter.

Bicycles may be legally and appropriately
ridden along many public roads. The Chessie
Nature Trail provides a rare special environment
for pedestrians — hikers, runners, bird-watchers,
fishermen, etc. It is our responsibility to keep it
safe and pleasant for them.

Thank you for your assistance and coopera-
tion.

Sincerely,
Louise K. Dooley
Chessie Nature Trail Committee Chair

EC dips into
reserve funds

Pub Board takes no action
on student magazine proposal

 

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee had to tap into an emer-
gency reserve fund Monday night in order to grant $1,700

to the men’s volleyball club.

The volleyball allocation used up the $1,202 left in
the EC working reserve and the $374 in the student body
working reserve, EC Vice President Bo Russell.

Russell said the EC will draw money from a student

body ‘‘historical reserve’’ to make up the difference.

The historical reserve is an interest-bearing account
which is made up of funds from the student activities fee
which are not used by the EC, Russell said.

He said the account was created ‘‘for years like this

when money is tight, and the EC has used most of it.’’
Russell said he will probably transfer around $4,000
from the emergency reserve for use by the EC ‘‘in case

any more clubs come in.”’

The volleyball team requested $2,890 in funding. EC
President Giles Perkins said because the team came in
late in the funding year and because the EC funds were
so low, he thought the team should only get $1,500.

However, the committee voted 7-4 to give the team

$1,700.

In other news, the Publications Board could not
choose a format for the proposed new campus magazine
Monday night because it did not have a quorum.

Representatives of The Ring-tum Phi and Political
Review attended the meeting, but Calyx, Ariel, and Jour-
nal of Science representatives were present.

Calyx, Ariel, and Journal of Science voted last week
to create the new magazine, while the Phi voted against
the motion. Political Review was absent last week.

The next meeting is scheduled for Monday, Nov. 18
at 8 p.m. in the Phi office. All students with proposals

are invited.

Men in Confederate uniforms and women in

chambers Thursday night to protest the absence
of Confederate flags at a ceremony honoring
Stonewall Jackson this past summer.

Rudy York, who spoke for the Sons of
Confederate Veterans, told the council that his
group was not allowed to carry Confederate
flags in a parade through Lexington. The July
21 parade commemorated the 100th anniversary
of the unveiling of a statue of Jackson in
Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery.

IFC to vote on fraternity

and Lee.

He said if IFC votes to allow
Alpha Phi Alpha, ‘‘philosophically,
we... [would be] going against the
greater view that we want an in-
tegrated campus.

“But this school is big on student
autonomy,’’ Hicks said. ‘‘to get [A-
Ipha Phi Alpha] turned down goes
against a lot of what this school
stands for.’’

IFC has the final word on wheth-
er the historically black fraternity re-
establishes a chapter at W&L. Three-
fourths of IFC must vote for re-es-
tablishment for it to pass.

 

Chi Psi President Trevor Hil-
debrand said he supports Alpha Phi
Alpha coming to W&L even though
some of the men soliciting the black
fraternity were Chi Psi members.

““We’ve had three black guys
deactivate,’ Hildebrand said, ‘‘but I
think these guys should be able to
get the most of their college ex-
perience.”’

Only one representative at the
meeting challenged approval of Alpha
Phi Alpha, and he would not give his
name.

“It won’t keep integration in
houses,’’ he said.

Chi Psi Brandon Neblett said he
expects approval for Alpha Phi Al-
pha.

“Everybody seems to be in favor
of it,’’ Neblett said.

Cameron Humpries, ’93, Dallas,

Texas — ‘‘Why not. It will be
nice not being the new kid on the
block any longer. And it’s cer-
tainly fun watching the Phi sweat
out the threat of new competi
tion,’’

 

 

 

Emily Greer, ’92, Marion, Va.
- ‘I don’t have time to read
another magazine unless it’s going
to present some new ideas.’’

‘‘There are some segments of our com-

munity that might not have felt comfortable

attending a ceremony where a symbol that has
suffered the abuse of misinterpretation was dis-
played,’’ Shaw said.

York said the misinterpretation of the
Confederate flag should not have stopped the
planners from displaying the flag.

‘*Because a large proportion of the popula-
tion cannot distinguish between history and
hate, we have been wronged,’ he said.

York asked Lexington Mayor H.E. Derrick
to send letters of apology to leaders of the Sons
of Confederate Veterans and the Jackson family.
Derrick said he did not think he owed any
apologies.

understand that the original chapter
was not a member of the IFC. This
is unacceptable.”’

Support for approving the frater-
nity was strong, but not unanimous.
Howison refused to release the actual
vote of the SAC members.

‘Everyone kept an open mind
throughout this. process,’’ Howison
said. ‘‘Many of us shifted opinions.’’

While the social goals of the
fraternity, as a bridge between W&L
and Lexington’s minorities, are ad-
mirable, Howison said the SAC de-
bated the chapter’s viability without
more students involved.

The possibility of failure con-
cerned SAC member Cinda Rankin.

“T realize that they need diversity
as much as the white students do,’’
Rankin said. ‘‘They need the avail-
ability of varying choices. Our system
as it stands now doesn’t give them
many options.’’

The committee also examined the
pressures that would be put on in-
coming black students, possibly de-
tracting from the fraternity system.

But Howison noted that Alpha Phi
Alpha’s policy of holding winter rush
would give interested freshmen a
chance to go through fall rush first,
exposing them to the standard frater-
nity system.

Senior John Harris, a spokesman
for the W&L students who petitioned

 

   

 

 

Howison

Alpha: Phi Alpha, found the vote
encouraging.

‘I’m very pleased that the SAC
approved it,’’ Harris said. ‘‘I’ve been
working on this for a year and a half
and I’m overwhelmed. I just hope the
IFC makes the same decision."’

Yet Harris realizes the battle will
not be easy.

“I think the IFC’s biggest ques-
tion is how Alpha Phi Alpha will fit
into the rush program here on cam-
pus,’’ Harris said.

Howison said the opinions of the
fraternity presidents were mixed. The
presidents favored giving an oppor-
tunity to those minority students not
interested in the existing fraternities
but thought inviting Alpha Phi Alpha
might encourage a segregated system.

Howison said he expects a de-
cision from the IFC before Thanks-
giving break.

“It was a heated and interesting
discussion, but now it’s out of my
hands,’’ Howison said.

Several Washington and Lee students say they think their participation as
student coaches in local recreation programs for children have improved the
college’s standing in the Lexington community.

The Rockbridge Area Recreational Organization brings the students
together with local children between ages eight and 13 to form, football, soc-
cer, basketball and lacrosse teams. According to RARO Program Coordinator
Chad Joyce, the student coaching has met with great success.

‘The kids intermingle really well with the students,’’ Joyce said, ‘‘kids
kind of look up to them.”

The student coaches say they enjoy the kids as well.'

‘Coaching is fun and the kids are cool,’’ said W&L junior Hobson Barnes,
who coached soccer.

When the program began three years ago however, many area parents were
so outraged at the idea that they took their children to other youth leagues,
according to Joyce.

“‘T think there was a lot of resentment when we first started letting stu-
dents coach,’’ Joyce said.

Parents gradually got used to seeing college kids coach their children,
Joyce said, and that now some parents even appreciate the advantages of
student coaching.

W&L seniors Will Jones and Spencer Patton, who have coached RARO
football for three years, agreed that the program’s popularity has increased.

‘It has become a lot more competitive since my sophomore year. This

| W&LIFE
Students and kids make RARO \ work

was the best team I've had,’’ Patton said.
‘The parents get a better view of W&L students,’ Jones added.
All the coaches urged other students to get involved.
“I think [RARO’s] a good thing,’’ Swift said.
“It’s really good for a positive relationship between the school and com-

munity,’’ he said.

Joyce said he thinks the kids react better with the students because they
are younger and can still remember when they were kids.

“It’s not another kid’s parent they have to listen to,’’

The absence of parental authority, however, can cause disciplinary pro-
blems, according to W&L junior Whit Swift, who coached soccer.

“*You have trouble with a few kids [who] don’t respond to you as well
Swift said.

Junior Key Foster, who coached 13- and 14-year-olds, said that his soccer
team had a few disciplinary problems also.

“*At that age they’re a little rebelious and a little hard to handle,’’ Foster

as they would to an adult,"

said.

“But generally they were really good,’’ he added.

W&L junior Walter Todd coached a football team that won only one
game, and he stressed that winning is not the focus of RARO.

‘You're just trying to instill in the kids good sportsmanship,”’

Swift agreed, saying the hardest part of coaching is balancing the kids’
desire to play with the coaches’ desire to win.

“It was hard keeping everyone happy as far as playing time is con-

He added ‘‘You really want to win, but you also want to make sure

everyone had a good time.’’

Several Washington and Lee
groups have planned projects to
aid local help agencies during
Thanksgiving.

The Washington and Lee Inter-
fraternity Council will conduct a
canned food drive to help the
Community Outreach Program of
Lexington, which encourages
neighborhood involvement in help
programs.

As part of the drive, various
W&L fraternities and _ sororities
will put grocery bags donated by
Harris Teeter on __ residents’
doorsteps.

A week later, more nonperish-
able foods will be collected and
distributed to families in need.

Similarly, Chi Omega sorority
will conduct a canned food drive
to supplement donations collected

by the R.E. Lee Episcopal Church.

‘*A lot of area citizens have
been hit hard by the recession,”’
said member Amy Beall, ‘‘so the
community will be appreciative.’’

Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity
members will collect food and
money for Habitat for Humanity
next week.

Other organizations sponsoring
food drives are Alpha Phi Omega
Service fraternity and Campus
Crusade for Christ. The contribu-
tions will go to needy Lexington
residents, as well as the Buena
Vista Food Bank.

‘*The students do what they
can to help, and we've had
tremendous response from _ the
community in the past, huge boxes
were filled at places like Kroger,”’
said an organizer of one of last
year’s drives.

Delta Tau Delta fraternity will
sponsor a skeet shoot for the
United Way. Teams of three may

 

 

Holidays are a time for help

participate for $30 on Saturday,
November 16 from 1 to 6 p.m.

Winners will receive dinner for
three at the Willson-Wa)ker House.

“You bring the shotgun, and
we’ll provide the shells,’’ said Delt
member Rob Wilson.

Kappa Alpha Theta sorority
will hold its annual Gong Show, a
singing/lin-synching competition
Wednesday night in the Pit.
Proceeds from the show will be
split among several charities.

Theta) members have also
begun working on Christmas dona-
tions for needy area children.

According to Theta Service
Chair Morgan Warner, the group
has obtained names of over 100
children its members will
anonymously donate gifts to.

Gladys House Director of
Volunteers Mac Crawford said
many local organizations like the
homeless shelter will need extra
help during the holidays season.

Cadets fight blazes for fun

 

By Babli Sinha
Staff Reporter

 

About sixty of Virginia Military Institute’s students
have been in the hot seat all year. The members of the
college’s volunteer Fire Squad have been called to
fight three nearby forest fires since August.

Most recently the cadets battled last month’s 1500-

acre Piney Mountain Fire near Buena Vista. Squad
members were called to fight the five- acre Mas-
sanutten Fires in Rapahannock Co., Virginia. They also
fought a twenty-five acre fire in Bridgewater, Virginia.

The group was trained by the United States
Forestry Department and the Virginia Forest Service.
The Forestry Department calls members to help area
fire departments fight blazes, and assigns them the part
of the fires they work on.

Senior fire squad member Alex Jackson described
the squad as ‘‘laborers.’” The group’s main respon-
sibility is to build firelines to stop the spread of the
ground fires, which burn through the root systems and
take longer to put out completely. This involves encir-
cling the fire with water hoses and five-gallon sacks of
water, called ‘‘Bladder Bags.”’

According to Senior Chris Bergstol, who heads the
fire squad, squad members are issued fireproof
clothing, helmets, and combat boots,.as; .wells-as

equipment like fire rakes and axes to combat the fires,
by the Forestry Department.

Senior fire squad member Clint Seybold said the
most tedious job come after the fire, when the cadets
perform ‘‘cleanup,’’ which involves searching out
patches of stray flames and putting them out.

The squad breaks into crews of twenty, which work
in twelve-hour shifts. They are escorted only by a
Forest Service worker who knows the terrain.

Sometimes the cadets may fight fires for days at a
time without sleep. When they must camp out at a site
or stay overnight to fight a fire, The Forestry Depart-
ment pays for all costs. Squad members are still ex-
pected to attend classes upon their arrival back at VMI.

The cadets must also be ready to leave VMI in a
hurry if they are called to a fire. Bergstol said he is
notified of the fire by the Forestry Department through
the college. He informs all of the other members of the
assignment.

Although fighting fires can be very dangerous, there
have been no major injuries among squad members in
the past years.

The cadets said fighting fires is grueling work.
They say they often work in the bitter cold and walk
for miles with burdensome equipment on their backs.
According to one, most get "excited about going’’.

Some, like Clint Seybold, plan to go in to the
forest. service. after waduaiion, 2

Late prof’s poetry published in book

 

By Jameson Leonardi
Staff Reporter

A book of poetry by Clark Mol-
lenhoff, the late Pulitzer-prize winn-
ing journalist and Washington and
Lee professor, has recently been
published.

Mollenhoff, who wrote 11 other
books, was famous for his inves-
tigations into government fraud and
corruption. He was a professor at
W&L from 1978 until his death last
March.

Ballad to an lowa Farmer and
Other Reflections, Mollenhoff’s only
book of poetry, contains almost fifty
poems expressing his feelings on
common subjects like childhood,
being a young man away from home
in the army, and being a good parent.

Several of Mollenhoff’s poems
found fame during his lifetime. The
poem ‘‘Teacher,’’ first published in
the Des Moines Sunday Register in
1957, gained national attention in
1982 when then-President Ronald
Reagan used it in a speech on educa-
tion.

Another poem, ‘‘Music Man,’’ was
used in Meredith Willson’s musical
of the same name. The poem focuses
on Mollenhoff’s brother, a high
school band director.

People might wonder why Mollen-
hoff, a journalist famous for objec-
tively pursuing the truth, would write
poetry. Hampden Smith, head of the
W&L journalism department, bel-
ieves that Mollenhoff wrote poetry in
order to keep his emotions out of his
reporting.

“‘Clark was big, blustery, and

worldly,’’ Smith said. ‘‘He was
driven by a great sense of right and
wrong. His humanity shows up in
his poetry.’’
The following is an excerpt from
Ballad to an lowa Farmer and Other
Reflections. Mollenhoff wrote the
poem as a tribute to John Atanasoff
who along with graduate student
Clifford Berry, designed the first
digital computer. Previous to a fed-
eral court decision in 1973 it was
commonly believed that John Mauch-
ly and Presper Eckert were the inven-
tors. They in fact derived their ideas
from Atanasoff.

Ballad To John V. Atanasoff

At lowa State
in thirty-eight
John turned our world around,
With vacuum tubes,
he theorized,
Swift answers could be found

For problems that

had stumped the world
Of science and of math.
John reasoned that

a base of two
Could guide him on his path.

It started with
a long cold drive,
A drink, a quiet thought.
In darkened bar,
John found the theme
To solve what Babbage sought.

At lowa-State

in thirty-nine
His theories met the test
Of prototype,

then desk-sized frame-
A stimulating quest.

With Berry's help,
John built the rig
To test his theories out.

Then as a team
they built the frame
To banish any doubt.

The job was done
when Mauchly came
To view the new machine.
Naive and proud,
they told him all.
John saw no need to screen.

What Mauchly saw-

what Mauchly read.
This scholar was no knave.
This man of letters

would not steal
Or soil the trust they gave.

Then John and Cliff
turned to the work

Of science in the war-

No draft deferments
to pursue

What could have mattered more.

John left the fate
of patent work

In hands he thought were sure
To follow through

in steady ways.
His right would then endure.

But Mauchly broke
his trust with John
And built the ENIAC.
The plans derived
from Cliff and John
Were clothed in secrets black.

And Mauchly took
the bows for years
For concepts that he stole.
He dodged and weaved
and outright lied
To hide John's rightful role.

For thirty years,
he pushed his lies
For profit and for power,
In deposition,
under oath,
Old Mauchly’s "truths" turned sour.

In trials in court,

the truth prevailed.
Judge Larson said it all:

Entitled to stand tall-

To take the bows
for concepts great
Derived from his machine
Through ENIAC
was steps beyond
What Mauchly’s eyes had seen.

In U.S. court
the record long
Proved that the concepts great
Were tested first

At Iowa State

John proved his right to fame.
The world around
Should know it’s time
To celebrate his name.

Genius too long forgot.

To end deceitful rot.

The Publications Board wants to form a monthly student
magazine that will include balanced, in-depth, journalistic |
reporting and a clearly labeled opinion section. The board |
will accept proposals for the proposed magazine at a special |
meeting on Monday, Nov. 18 at 8 p.m. in The Ring-tum Phi :
office, University Center 208. A proposal on Monday must
include a written mission statement and a proposed operat-
ing budget for two trial issues (see below); other require-
ments for formal recognition (see below) may be worked out
in detail after the board accepts a proposal for considera-
tion. Note, however, that the board will have full discretion
in choosing chief editors and, if necessary, a business
manager for the new publication, as provided for in the Pub
Board constitution.

The following are the procedures for Pub Board
recognition of a new student publication, from the Pub Board
constitution:

“4. The Publications Board will not recognize any proposed or
existing publication which states and/or demonstrates a political or cultural
ideology. Whether or not a publication has a particular ideology shall be
determined by a majority vote of the Publications Board members.

“2. A proposed publication must fulfill the following minimum
criteria to the satisfaction of the Publications Board in order to be

considered for recognition:

Mogk’s running spurs offensive surge

 

From page 8

 

‘‘We put our three receivers on
one side and brought Wilson under-
neath the coverage,’’ Fallon said.
‘Geren put the ball in the perfect
spot for the way Wilson had beaten
the defender.”’

Moore was able to make an over-
the-shoulder catch for his second
touchdown on the season.

After Moore’s score brought the
Generals to within 25-7, both defen-
ses took over, shutting the other team
down, and Guilford left Lexington
with the 25-7 win and a share of the
ODAC tile.

On the day, Mogk led the offense
with 89 yards rushing on just 12

carries, by far W&L’s best rushing
day of the season.

‘*Mogk has shown a lot of prom-
ise as a ball carrier,’’ said Fallon.

Mogk’s effort keyed W&L’s sea-
son-high 229 yards of total offense.

Despite the loss, Fallon takes
pride in the fact that his team hasn’t
been blown out.

‘‘No one has really blown us off
the field and embarrassed us,’’ he
said. ‘‘] look around and their are
other winless teams losing 55-0.
We're still fighting and playing
tough.

“Our kids are concerned about
play, of course, but not down,’’ Fal-
lon said. ‘‘I have to admire these
kids because they’re still working
hard.’’

The Generals get one more chance
to win a game this season Saturday
at Georgetown. The Hoyas’ feature
the best passing attack in Division
III, averaging 307 yards a game.

“Georgetown will be a chal-
lenge,’ Fallon said. ‘‘It’s been no
fluke because they’ve played some
good teams. If you compare scores,
then we shouldn’t even show up.”’

The Generals, though, are not in-
timidated by the Hoyas.

‘We're going up to get our first
win,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘Win, lose, or
draw, Georgetown will know they’ve
been in a game.”’

The Generals, who have been
allowing 131 yards passing, received
a defensive boost when senior Fred
Renneker moved back to defense

against Guilford.

‘‘We knew we had Guilford and
Georgetown coming up on the sched-
ule,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘Also, Geren has
had some success running our regular
I-formation offense. So we put Fred
back on defense, and that’s where
he’s practiced the last two weeks.”’

Renneker played defense for the
first time in 15 games and registered
four tackles and blocked two extra
points in limited action. Renneker
started at quarterback for the first
eight games of the season.

The Generals have not had a
winless season since 1957. W&L last
went into the last game of the season
winless in 1975. The Generals beat
Georgetown 28-26 to get their only
win of the year.

 

 

Freshman running back Matthew Mogk runs through a hole in the

Lynchburg tops

Polo pulls off Eastern upset

 

By Andrew Fox
Staff Reporter

 

Lynchburg College nipped Wash-
ington and Lee’s men’s cross country
team 28-36 in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference championship
meet held Saturday at Hampden-Syd-
ney College.

The Generals gave a solid team
performance, but it was not enough
to overtake LC.

“When you place five runners in
the top ten, you usually win,’ said
coach John Tucker. ‘‘But Lynchburg
ran a great race.”’

Lynchburg, paced by all-American
Greg Cavaliere, captured four of the
top five places. However, the race
was far from over after these four
finished.

The Hornets’ fifth runner lagged
far behind the Generals top five, all
of whom finished under 27:45.

‘‘This was the best race overall
for our top five since I have been
here,’’ Tucker said.

Yet, the strong effort fell just
short as the LC fifth runner finished
sixteenth, which was just good
enough to secure the victory.

Bo Hannah ran a personal best
time of 26:06, only eleven seconds
behind Cavaliere, to finish third over-
all and lead the Generals. Charles
Edwards also ran well as he finished
sixth overall and second for the team
with a time of 27:16.

Hannah and Edwards both earned
all-ODAC honors for their efforts.
The duo will look to extend their
excellent seasons by placing well in
next Saturday’s regional championship
meet.

‘“‘Bo and Charles are both strong
contenders to qualify for nationals,”’
Tucker said.

Also making a strong contribution
was Dave Martin, a heralded track
athlete, who volunteered to run for
the team and finished eighth overall
and third for the team in his only
meet of the year. Personal bests were
turned in by Lee Parker and Keith
Rinn, who finished fourth and fifth,
respectively, for the Generals.

W&L, ranked fifth in the region,
now head into the Southeastern cham-
pionships at Christopher Newport
College in Newport News, Va. The
Generals will look to even the season
series with the Hornets at two wins
each,

The experts predicted that the
Washington and Lee water polo team
would not win a game at the Eastem
Conference Championships.

Those predictions appeared ac-
curate at first when the Generals
dropped the opening match of the
tournament to top-ranked Slippery
Rock by a score of 13-3. However,
W&L rebounded in their second
match to stun 16th-ranked University
of Massachusetts 14-13 in triple over-
time.

After suffering a lackluster offen-
sive performance against Slippery
Rock, the Generals responded with a
courageous effort from senior All-
American Will Davis and sophomore
Greg Golub. Davis stymied the
UMASS defense with five goals to

keep the Generals close and Golub
added two goals, including the game
winner.

“Though we were clearly the
underdogs of the tournament, we
proved the critics wrong with our un-
intimidated and aggressive play,’’ said
Davis.

The Generals aggressive play car-
ried over to their third match against
20th-ranked Bucknell University.
Despite losing 9-6 in double over-
time, the team proved that their win
over UMASS was no fluke. Goalie
P.J. Waicus was impressive in the net
with 10 blocks, but the offense ran
out of gas in the second overtime,
dooming the Generals’ chances for
another upset victory.

Despite the heartbreaking loss to
Bucknell, W&L head coach Page
Remillard was exuberant with his
player’s performance all season.

‘‘While other teams wanted to

party in September and October, we
wanted to wait until November before
celebrating,’’ he said.

Apparently the success was worth
the wait. The Generals secured key
victories in November over the Univ-
ersity of Richmond and UMASS, the
runner up of the New England Con-
ference.

‘‘This was the best team I’ve had
here at W&L,”’ said Remillard. ‘‘We
had great leadership from the seniors
and great cooperation from the under-
classmen. From the seniors on down
to the freshmen, we showed class all
year.”’

It was this leadership and class
that allowed the Generals to improve
each game at a faster rate than their
opponents. After a few tough losses
early in the season, W&L rallied in
October and November to close with
a 15-11 record.

Juniors Andrew Pearson and Chris
Hagge concluded that ‘‘the team
really improved over the course of
the season, something that our op-
ponents didn’t do.”’

Next year the Generals will miss
the leadership and productivity of
seniors Davis and Alan Herrick. Both
players lead the team in scoring with
59 and 57 goals respectively, and
also were the steal and shooting
percentage leaders. Despite their
absence, Remillard feels that the team
has the depth needed to be successful
again next year.

The play of veterans Golub, Hag-
ge, and Jake Berman will be comple-
mented by the talents of freshmen
Derek Devries, Reuben Munger, and
Tony Diederich. In addition, if goalie
P.J. Waicus can improve on his 198
blocks this season, the Generals will
once again be tough to beat.

The Washington and Lee women’s
cross country team finished the sea-
son on a high note as the Generals
finished third in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference championship
meet and reaped individual post sea-
son honors.

Kim Herring and Nicole Casteel

were both named to the all-ODAC
team, and coach Jim Phemister re-
ceived coach of the year honors in a
repeat performance.

W&L battled Roanoke College for
second place, but wound up a close
third. Eastern Mennonite was first
with a score of 37, Roanoke’s 51
was second, followed by W&L’s 53.

Kim Herring finished off what has
been the best year ever by a fresh-
man runner to finish fourth overall

and first for the team. She posted the
third fastest time ever for a W&L
runner at 19:50. With her personal
record time on the collegiate level,
Herring completed a string of seven
straight first place finishes for the
team out of seven meets on the year.

Also running a personal best was
Nicole Casteel whose time of 20:15
placed her seventh overall. Her time
was the sixth fastest time ever for a
W&L runner.

 

 

Freshman quarterback Geren Steiner surveys the situation in
W&L’s 29-7 loss to Bridgewater two weeks ago. Steiner will start
for the second straight week against Georgetown Saturday In what

should be an aerial battle. Georgetown Is the nation’s best passing
team, and W&L has thrown the ball 144 times in its last three

Along with Herring and Casteel,
the other runners in W&L’s top five
also recorded personal records. Sue

GC keeps W&L winless

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

The Guilford Quakers had been
one of the hottest football teams in
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference up until two weeks ago.

That was when Randolph-Macon
toppled the team that beat mighty
Emory and Henry. That loss kept
Guilford from winning the ODAC
title.

So the Quakers came to Lexington
last weekend to take on the Generals
in a rather unhappy state of mind.
Add to that the fact that the Generals
had upset the Quakers from running
through the ODAC undefeated last
year. Guilford was mad, and wanted
especially to get after the Generals.

On Saturday, the Generals were
able to cool Guilford down for a
while, but it was a penalty on a hot-
headed General that aided Guilford’s
cause,

After Guilford received what he
thought was a favorable mark on a
fourth-down play allowing them to
get a first down and maintain a drive,
W&L head coach Gary Fallon pro-
tested too much and was hit with a
15-yard penalty.

“It is the first penalty I’ve had in
14 years,’’ he said. ‘*And that penal-
ty really turned out to hurt us.”’

The penalty put the ball on the
W&L 15-yard line, and two plays
later, Calvin Hunter scored to give
the Quakers the lead.

The Generals got another bad
break when, on their next possession,
a snap went over punter Bob Ehret’s

Volleyball fights
tough in loss
to Guilford

From Staff Reports

 

 

The Washington and Lee vol- |

leyball finished up its season with a
loss in the quarterfinals of the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference Tour-
nament.

After disposing of Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College in the first
round, the Generals ran into the
regular season ODAC champions in
Guilford College.

As expected, W&L had its hands
full. The Quakers quickly ran off the
first two games before W&L was
able to apply some pressure.

In the third game, the Generals
opened up leads of 2-0, 5-2 and 11
5 before the Quakers called time
and regrouped. After the break, Guili-
ford ran off the last 10 points to win
the game and the match.

The Generals’ season ended with
an 11-21 record. Guilford -vent on to
win the tournament, upping its mark
to 34-4,

W&L got outstanding seasons
from senior Mena McGowin, who
finished her career with over 800
kills, and Leslie Hess, who set a
school record with 52 blocks.

The Generals also found a nucleus
for the coming years in freshmen

ston. Garrigus led the team in digs,
and Ralston had W&L’s third-highest
assist total of all-time.

head into the end zone, where the
Quakers recovered for their second
touchdown and a 13-0 lead after one
quarter.

Early in the second quarter, the
Quakers added to their lead. Hunter
scored on a 12-yard run to make in
19-0 on Guilford’s first possession
and later in the quarter, Pat Tull.
scored from 14 yards out to close the
scoring in the half at 25-0,

“It could have gotten ugly,’’ Fal-
lon said. ‘‘But our kids shut them
down in the second half and we got
some confidence. We hung in
tough.’’

The Generals shut out the Quakers
in the second half, and the run-and-
shoot offense got untracked after
struggling against Guilford’s blitzing
defense in the first half.

Freshman = quarterback ~— Geren
Steiner led the team on an 88-yard
drive, getting unexpected help from
the running game.

With freshman Matthew Mogk
running for seven and eight yards a
carry, the Generals were able to
loosen the Quakers’ secondary. When
the defense keyed on Mogk, Steiner
was able to find freshman Michael
MacLane open down the field for a
44-yard gain.

Steiner completed the drive with a
perfect 10-yard touchdown pass to
sophomore Wilson Moore.

‘“Wilson’s catch was as pretty a
catch as I've seen all year,”’ said
Fallon.

The catch was a confidence builder
for Moore, who was wide open but
dropped a pass on the previous play.

a year.

+ He was suspended after being
tried by the Student Conduct Com-

Victory over Hoyas averts no-win record

The Publications Board Monday
approved a format for a new student
news magazine and began accepting
applications for editors and a business
manager.

The monthly news magazine will
include a ‘‘point/counterpoint’’ sec-
tion with opposing opinions about a
selected topic, an editorial section and
at least one in-depth news article,
according to sophomore Matt Jack-
son’s format proposal.

Jackson is a founder and editor of
The Traveller, an independent student
magazine.

Jackson said he does not know if
he will apply for the editorship of the
new magazine.

Jackson said he is also unsure of
The Traveller's future. He said this
week’s issue might be the last.

“I don’t think both [The Traveller
and the new magazine] can coexist,"
Jackson said. ‘‘It will be either the
staff of The Traveller and some peo-
ple from the W&L community work-
ing on the new magazine or everyone
will stay on The Traveller and the
new magazine will fail.’’

The format was approved by a 3-
2 vote. Ariel, Calyx and Journal of
Science voted to adopt the format,
while The Ring-tum Phi and Political
Review voted against it.

view, said a new magazine would be

Founded September 18, 1897

Think before you
vote tonight

In an attempt to sway IFC’s vote in favor of approving
Alpha Phi Alpha, Interfraternity Council President Greg
Hicks moved Tuesday’s vote to tonight.

He seems to hope that given more time to think about
the issue, and given more time to feel guilty about deny-
ing the petition of their fellow students, many fraternity
men might change their minds to the politically correct
opinion favoring Alpha Phi Alpha.

We expect the postponement to have the opposite
effect. Fraternity men will become more frustrated with
the unresolved issue and forget the practiced rhetoric of
Alpha Phi Alpha’s representative, who spoke Monday.

But the facts in the case have not changed. We main-
tain that a vote for Alpha Phi Alpha is a vote to stall
Washington and Lee’s movement toward integration, if not
reverse it.

Alpha Phi Alpha’s presentation Monday was more an
appeal to emotion than logic. There were no new facts.

The student petitioners for the new fraternity argued
two main points: Alpha Phi Alpha will fill an intangible
social need of black students the current fraternity system
does not; and Alpha Phi Alpha is fundamentally different
from other fraternities, primarily in its service orientation.

These arguments are contradictory. While the petitioners
tout Alpha Phi Alpha as different from a social fraternity,
they say they need it to upgrade their social lives.

Contradiction aside, however, the petitioners failed to
allay fears that the Alpha Phi Alpha chapter here will not
further segregate the community. While they began their
arguments by denouncing generalizations like “*black’’ and
‘‘white,’’ in the end they themselves used these terms like
everyone else.

The representative from the fraternity also failed to
shed any new light on the issue.

First of all, he has only visited campus two times since
September, and neither visit was a lengthy one. Accord-
ing to Hicks, he will not return to W&L prior to
Thursday. This lack of involvement raises some doubt
about Alpha Phi Alpha’s commitment to a W&L chapter.

More importantly, his contribution to the discussion
centered on Alpha Phi Alpha’s admirable work with the
Boy Scouts of America and high school students nation-
wide. It gave an impression that voting against Alpha Phi
Alpha would be un-American. Overall, he made a very
good sales pitch. That’s okay; that’s his job.

But while a W&L chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha might
contribute a great deal to the Lexington community, its
effects on the W&L community will not be constructive.
Yes, the IFC would become integrated. But when students
walked out the IFC doors, the black students would go
one way and the white students another.

Black student involvement in the fraternity system,
unheard of 20 years ago, is increasing today. National
fraternities that may be called historically white are na-
tionally overcoming racial separation. At most houses
today, the question is not how to keep black students out,
but how to change to make them feel welcome.

Many fraternity members are undoubtedly reading this
editorial as they sit together at dinner. We urge them to
take this time to consider the facts and let their IFC
representative know what they think. We believe their
consideration will lead them to the difficult decision to
deny the petition for Alpha Phi Alpha. But whatever
decision they make, they should take care to be certain of
their convictions, as there will likely be repercussions
from this vote for many years to come.

I tumed on Headline News the other day
(Cheers wasn’t on yet) and heard that Oral Roberts
has written a letter to one million of his ‘‘closest
followers’’ asking EACH for $500. There is
apparently a ‘‘satanic conspiracy’ against his
congregation: It’s bad enough he HAS one million
followers, but the sad thing is, those dumb saps
who inexplicably love him will probably fall for it
again.

Is the world going completely nuts or is it just
me? Forget evangelists; Judgment Day seems to be
coming. Fires have destroyed about five billion
acres of forest out West this year, playing a recent
engagement in Oakland’s backyard. A ‘‘former’’
Neo-Nazi KKK Grand Dragon nearly won the
governorship of Louisiana, and the guy who finally
did win that election is about as appealing as Ted
Kennedy. And the latest reports say David Duke
wants to run for PRESIDENT in 1992.

And let us not forget that the entire state of
West Virginia was recently on fire and sent a ton
of smoke and soot to good old Lexington. I got
asphyxiated each morning as I walked out of my
apartment. My roommate kept muttering about a
mass exodus of coal miners and inbreeds into the
Shenandoah Valley (actually, I said that, but it’s
more fun to blame my roommate; and West
Virginians, don’t get mad, I live in Georgia). The
ozone hole is expanding, the blue whales are
dying, the Democratic party seems to be getting
organized, and I can’t find my dress socks.

Face it, Armageddon is nigh. Michael Dukakis
is coming to speak for Mock Convention, and I
keep wondering if there is a lost verse in
Revelations about a short Greek presidential wanna-
be visiting Washington and Lee. If that isn’t a sign
of doom, what is? I’d rather see locusts on the
Colonnade.

And speaking of the Colonnade, we might be
getting an addition in the form of a new arts
building. Thanks, guys, why bother giving us
something we really need, like a new computer
room or an expanded research library... or a bar?
Next thing you know, when we all come back in

Spectator cover
insults staff

To the Editor:

Well, we've gotta hand it to the Spectator.
One always expects the worst of them, and they
never fail to deliver. Take the latest cover.
Remember it? The one with the cleaning-lady
bent over her task in some fraternity house, the
words ‘‘Just what are we paying them for any-
way?’’ emblazoned across her face? I know this
letter follows the event rather belatedly; I’m just
now getting over my disbelief. That cover was so
appallingly offensive, it was almost surreal.

At first glance, I was startled. ‘‘Did that lady
give her permission?’’ I instantly wondered. I
mean, it struck me as rather too powerful an
image for a story that was objecting to the
condition of these overworked, underpaid people.
But no. Silly, silly me. The Spectator was not
championing W&L’s dedicated and competent
maintenance staff. No, it was training upon them
its well-tried arsenal of smarmy, whining der-
ision. The cover photo was intended not to invite
sympathy for its subject, but to provoke contempt
for her ever-so-far-beneath-us function at this
university and, unbelievably, outrage at her
arrogantly-implied shiftlessness and greed.

The article to which this photo ‘‘relates’’
concerns the alleged mismanagement of contrac-
tual arrangements for the post-Renaissance main-
tenance of fraternity houses. Possible misdoings
on the administration’s part, and on the part of
upper-level staff at Stonewall Management Ser-
vices, are involved. The character of the latter
firm's lower-level employees is not involved.

 

twenty years, the Colonnade will be painted bright
green, the fraternities will all have become
administration filing cabinets or hold valuable
collections of extremely rare Mongolian silverware,
and John Wilson will still be university president.

On top of all of this chaos, I’ve got to try and
convince myself that Nostradamus was wrong; the
world won't self-destruct in 1997, and I have to
find a job.

Underclassmen, don’t think for a second that
any senior worth his or her GPA wouldn’t switch
with your seemingly-insignificant lives. You see,

being interviewed for responsible positions in
society after spending four years in a ‘‘country
club’’ (thanks, Dad) can be a mite stressful. Goals?
I'd be happy to work at East Lex after graduation,
or maybe open a bar (how many of you have has
that dream? Get in line and take a number, I’m
ahead of you).

Back to my roommate, the C-school major (yes,
I know, he must be insane). He tells me horror
stories of interviews by big businesses. They make
the Inquisition sound like a preliminary for the Girl
Scouts of America. Some people supposedly induce
stress into the interview to see how you handle it.
Sounds like some of my teachers.

Anonymous English prof.: ‘‘You really have
NO idea what Milton is saying, do you?”

Grovelling English major: ‘‘No,
Worshipfulness.’’

Abominable Academian: ‘‘I have a collection
of retarded children in my classroom. Western
civilization is doomed. Now why don’t you
paraphrase verses 1-10 for the entire class?’’

Try this on for size: You get in one of your
father’s old suits, even shave for a change, and
head for your first interview at Greedy
Corporation, Inc. The interviewer is the company’s
59-year-old CEO. The room has two chairs, a desk,
and a 1000-watt naked bulb over your chair. You
sit down to discover that the right front chair leg

LETTERS

They are just doing their job, and even the
Spectator, by a miracle of forbearance, does not
suggest that they’re doing it poorly. But it does
include unnecessary, condescending images (on
the cover and on pages 12-13) of these people
hard at work cleaning W&L’s opulent new rich
kids’ clubs. The gratuitous representation of these
images, in a clearly dispataging context, is a
profoundly obnoxious reflection of the Spectator’s
pervasive cheap-shot-taking snottiness. It is an
insult to everyone whose economic status has
them cleaning our halls, whether they work for
Stonewall Management, W&L, or anyone else. I
assure you, Spectator, any money we are being
overcharged for maintenance does not land in the
pockets of these ladies or their co-workers, to all
of whom you owe an apology.

We at Washington and Lee are privileged to
inhabit one of the most unutterably lovely and
impeccably well kept-up college environments in
the world. Don’t the snivelling, cossetted mama’s
boys behind the Spectator have anything better to
do than go out of their way to insult and demean
the hardworking men and women who keep it
that way?

says in between baleful stares, ‘‘I graduated susmma

my class at Harvard Law School. What can YOU
offer the company?’’

Is my finding a job, getting married, raising
two-point-seven kids, and slaving away for their
benefit worth all this? Hell no, I said. So, I’m
unemployed. My father also announced that on
June 4, the free ride is over. Swell. As Peter
Benchley said, the Western economy is about to
implode, and I’m broke. I suppose The Washington
Post could pick me up to do a bi-weekly column
(just look how well I’m doing now). Did college
prepare me for the big bad world? Well, my social
skills are certainly down pat. Wouldn’t that look
nice on a resume?

Maybe I'll stay around and work for W&L like
50 percent of last year’s class. Although,
considering who I’d be working for, maybe I
should just become a shoe salesman like Al Bundy
and raise a family of morons on my cwn TV

Delt plans pass commission, go to

Plans for the last house to go through Frater-
nity Renaissance passed the Lexington Planning
Commission Nov. 14 after arguments concerning
where residents would park their cars.

W&L will make its final request for the condi-
tional use permit to renovate Delta Tau Delta, at
106 Lee Avenue, to the Lexington City Council
lee. 2:

“I’m happy to move on to the city council,”’
W&L Coordinator of Capital Planning Frank
Parsons said. ‘‘While it’s always good to get past
the planning commission, the city council is likely
to address much the same issues.’’

Making Delt conform to the city’s one bed, one
parking spot rule brought the meeting’s most
intense discussion. Currently, Delt has room for
six parking places on the property, but the renova-
tion plans will lower that number to three.

Delt now holds a non-conforming use permit
exempting it from the parking rule, but the house
must give up that permit before renovations. It will
need 17 additional spaces within 500 feet of the
house to bring it up to code.

In its site plan, the university proposed renovat-
ing the parking lot behind the Chi Psi house, on
the corner of Lee Avenue and Nelson Street, to
accomodate both Delt and Chi Psi parking require-
ments.

However, commission members were concerned
that the proposed plan would require double-load-
ing eight cars into the lot.

In the end, the committee realized double-
loading was not a factor in the decision on Delt.

Vice-Chairman Robert Akins noted the Chi Psi
house, which was formerly an elementary school,
is in a ‘‘commercial’’ zone and is therefore exempt
from the parking rule.

While the university will still expand the Chi
Psi lot, the eight double-loaded spaces will not be
included. Chi Psi will offer all additional parking

¥ Gong
sounds
in GHQ

By Pamela Kelley
Associate Editor

 

 

Washington and Lee’s Kappa
Alpha Theta sorority struck a chord
on campus Wednesday night with its
second annual Gong Show.

More than 200 people crowded
into the General Headquarters for the
show, a fund raiser for Theta’s na-
tional philanthropy and the Rock-
bridge Area Recreation Organization.

The annual fund raiser is a spoof
of a popular 1970s game show with
the same name, in which celebrity
Judges scored acts and sounded a
gong to stop the worst ones.

Most of the Theta show’s 11 acts,
which included lip-synch numbers and
comedy routines, were performed by
fraternity and sorority members.

Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity’s
pledge class won the show’s $100
cash prize, with a rendition of Monty
Python’s ‘‘Lumberjack Song.”’

Seven Chi Psi pledges captured
second place with their portrayal of a
day in the life of Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’
Atkins, W&L associate dean of stu-
dents for Greek affairs.

Third place went to a group of
Phi Kappa Psi fraternity members,
who lip-synched the rap song ‘‘Good
Vibrations’? by Marky Mark and the
Funky Bunch.

Among the other acts, Phi Gam-
ma Delta fraternity members per-
formed a partial strip tease to Jimmy
Buffet’s ‘*Volcano.”’

History Prof. Taylor Sanders,
Assistant Politics Prof. Mark Rush
and Associate Prof. of Romance
Languages Gwen Campbell judged
the competition.

Sanders, who wore a tuxedo, also
performed ‘‘Rawhide’’ a capella for
the crowd.

The show was hosted by Univer-
sity Registrar Scott Dittman, who
posed as an unknown comic until he
was unmasked.

Gong Show Coordinator and Theta
member Denise Brainard said the

 

event raised more than $800 from
ticket sales and the show’s acts.

that Delt needs, and the university will allow Delt
residents to park in the Corral or other designated
student parking areas, Parsons said.

Chi Psi residents will be guaranteed eight
spaces in university parking areas.

In another discussion on Delt, the commission
rejected a Delt neighbor’s request for a brick wall
to separate him from the fraternity house. Instead,
the commission adopted the university’s plan to use
a six-foot cedar fence and hedges to shield the
fraternity house from its neighbor.

1992 FOC picks 25

 

By Rick Peltz
Editor

 

More than 60 students applied for
the 1992 Freshman Orientation Com-
mittee, largely because of this year’s
successful program, FOC Vice Chair-
man Teresa Williams said.

FOC named 25 to its ranks, 10
more than Williams and Chairman
Robert Wilson had planned to name,
Williams said.

‘‘We just had a tremendous inter-
est in FOC,’’ Williams said. ‘‘We
interviewed a lot of people who said,
‘Orientation didn’t seem as much fun
as what the freshmen did this year.’’’

Icebreaker games were the most
talked-about addition to this year’s
orientation program. Freshmen broke
down into small groups in the War-
ner Center, where they played games

‘The freshmen may have
complained a lot about the games,”’
Williams said, ‘‘but the [members of
the] class of ’95 know each other
better than classes ahead of them.’’

While icebreakers will be retained,
Williams said other aspects of the
orientation program will be changed,
such as the Freshman Record, or face
book.

She said the book will include
more candid photos and pictures of
deans and dorm counselors.

‘‘Our book is an embarrassment’’
compared to other schools’ books,
many of which are like ‘‘mini-year-

She said some FOC members
were chosen especially for their po-

A Washington and Lee theater major is
bringing 15th century Japan to W&L.

Senior Chris Smith’s one-act Kyogen
comedy, called ‘‘The Perfect Servants,’’ ex-
amines relationships between the nobility and
their servants.

The show opens in the Lenfest’s Johnson
Theater on December 6.

Kyogen, which means ‘‘a comic interlude,’’
is a type of Japanese dramatic performance,
which dates back to the 15th century, Smith
said. The one-act Kyogens were staged between
acts of a Noh drama, which is longer and more
complicated stylistically, he said.

Although the two dramas were traditionally
performed together, Smith said he is only
presenting the Kyogen.

*‘My view was to isolate the Kyogen from
that setting to heighten its appeal to the W&L
audience,’’ Smith said.

The play’s author, Donald Richie, is an
American authority on Japanese film who lived
in Japan for 45 years.

Smith said the play will mark his directing
debut, and according to Richie, the first perfor-
mance of the Kyogen in the United States.

Smith said Richie called the Lenfest per-
formance the ‘‘American premiere’’ of the
Kyogen.

Smith cast two males in female roles
because he said it would add authenticity to the
play. He added ‘‘It will add to the comic
element of the play and lead the audience to-
ward a different perspective, especially with the
suggested love scene.’’

W&L sophomore Jeff Mikita prepares for his upcoming role as a female maid.

Kyogen to debut at W&L

Smith said the Kyogen is especially
difficult for actors because very body movement
expresses an emotion in this acting style.

Sophomore Jeff Mikita, who plays a
female maid, agreed. He said he found it
difficult to imitate feminine vocal and body
movements.

‘*The most difficult aspect has been the
choreography and characterization,’’ Mikita said.

Senior Ben Worth said playing a woman
is challenging, but amusing. However, he said
he was most interested in introducing a new
theater expression to W&L.

In order to communicate these aspects of
the Kyogen technique and gestures in his show,
Smith said he asked senior Karen Halsell, who
has extensive dance experience, for assistance.

Halsell, who knew nothing about Japanese
choreography, said she picked up the style by
watching several hours of Noh and Kyogen
drama on video.

Halsell said it was difficult to make Mikita
and Worth appear feminine and complimented
the cast, who she said was ‘‘willing to experi-
ment.”’

‘*They all met with their tasks extremely
well,’’ Halsell, a biology major, said. ‘‘It was
such a wonderful experience to finally get out
of the science buildings and work in the
Lenfest.’’

All the cast members noted that Smith re-
acted well with them as a director, and ex-
pressed confidence in the results.

“It’s more of a relaxed atmosphere with a
student director,’’ junior David Phillips said. ‘‘It
allows for much freedom in communication.’’

‘*We’re more willing to voice our opinions
and experiment with Chris [Smith],’’ Mikita
said.

Thanksgiving

Students scatter for the holiday

 

By Joshua Manning

After ten weeks of school, most Wash-
ington and Lee undergraduates look forward
to the long-awaited start of Thanksgiving
vacation Friday.

Most of the W&L student body will be
scattered across the country during the
holiday.

While junior Keith Rinn, from New
York, joins his entire family in San Francis-
co to visit his brother in law school, senior
Pete Trammell questions the use of Thanks-
giving without a big football game.

Trammell will be in College Station,
Texas, Thanksgiving Day watching Texas
A&M play the University of Texas
in an annual intra-state rivalry.

Senior John Flippen will travel to
New York City with several friends
for the first part of vacation before
returning home to Florence, Ala. for
the holiday.

“They have tickets to see
Phantom of The Opera while
I’m at a job interview,’’
Flippen said. ‘‘One of the
guys has never been to New
York before, so I guess we’ll
do the touristy things.’’

Some students, like soph-
omore Mandy Keegan of
California, will be getting a
head start on winter.

reasons.”’

A food service official said Evans Din-
ing Hall will close Friday at noon. Students
remaining in Lexington will be responsible
for feeding themselves.

But, for some. students, the American
holiday of Thanksgiving doesn’t carry the
same meaning. Sophomore Miko Nyberg, of
Norway, and exchange student Masahiro
Yamashita, of Japan, will spend the time in
Georgetown, possibly traveling on to New
York. What will they be doing?

‘Dos Equis, Heineken and maybe a few
shots of tequila,’ said Nyberg. ‘‘It’s sort of
a Thanksgiving tradition where I’m from.’
How about some Coronas or Molsens, or
maybe a couple of Kamikaze shots.

Other international students will be

spending vacation very differently. Akino ©

Tsuchiya, of Japan, will be traveling to
South Carolina to spend the holiday with
friends. Junior Hui-Chu Mou and exchange
student Takato Yabusako will import friends

to Lexington from Boston and Ohio respec- °

tively.

Meanwhile at the W&L Law School, it -

will be business as usual until classes end
Nov. 26.

Reading days will continue until finals
begin on Dec. 5, most of the law students
will leave Lexington for a brief Thanksgiv-
ing, but a dedicated few will stick around to
study. <
“I’m in the minority,’ said Mike
Carlson, a third-year law student.
‘“‘But it doesn’t disturb me because
I'm expecting an invitation from

Dean Henneman for Thanks-
giving dinner.”’

Dinner invitation or not, vaca-
tion can’t arrive soon enough
for senior Susan Watkins.

‘I’m ready to be taken care
of again and not have to do my
laundry myself,’’ Watkins said.
Whether you're off to an island, going
home, maybe visiting a friends house, or
even staying right here in Lexington, don’t
forget to have a great vacation.

Also, remember even if it will be a
holiday filled with work for school, you
don’t have to get up for classes in the
morning.

Have a very happy Thanksgiving!

The Ring-tum Phi, November 21, 1991

Students push politics

 

By Joyce Bautista
Staff Reporter

Every Sunday evening two sets of students square off
for a broadcasted battle of political ideologies called ‘‘The
Shooting Gallery.’’

The show, which started a month ago, is sponsored by
the Washington and Lee Foreign Affairs Club.

During the hour-long program, which begins at 8:30
p.m., the pairs debate several timely political issues.
Sophomores Matt Jackson and Ben Eggleston argue as
representatives of the Democratic Party. Their opponents,
first-year law students Tom Kleine and Chris Kowalczuk,
represent the views of the Republican party.

“It’s basically a debate format in which we discuss
national politics and some local issues,’’ said Jackson.

The four agree upon sparring topics about half-an hour
before each show.

On earlier shows the group has debated over Oliver
North’s new book Under Fire, civil rights, and the
politicians vying to become the U.S. Democratic
Presidential candidate.

““We've handled a good amount of sensitive topics,”’
Jackson said.

The participants say the aim of the show is to make

Imagine working 3-hours away from home four
days a week, and spending weekends writing a
doctoral thesis. For Jarvis Hall, newly appointed
assistant professor of politics, it’s all in a week’s
work.

After teaching classes in the Commerce School
from Monday to Thursday, Professor Hall hops in
his car and drives to Durham, NC to work on his
dissertation at Duke University.

Hall’s wife is an associate dean of [7
student counseling at the nearby
University of North Carolina at Cha-
pel Hill. The choice of Durham as a
home base actually serves to simplify
logisitical matters.

“‘The arrangement has generally
worked out quite nicely,’’ says Hall,
who lives in a university-owned fac-
ulty apartment when in Lexington.
‘*Although I haven’t had much of a

  

here,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s an excellent environment, par-
ticularly for a younger teacher, because the stu-
dents push you to be better prepared as a teacher.’’

Last year, Hall traveled to Duke to begin his
thesis, which is titled ‘‘The Relative Autonomy of
the State in Black Interest Articulation.’’ While he
spends most of his time there at the computer
terminal, he has had some exposure to Duke
academics.

‘I was a teaching assistant in a class of 200,”’
Hall said with a smile, noting the difference in
class sizes among schools.

listeners think about what’s going on in U.S. politics.

One listener, W&L freshmen Andy Wright, said he
thought the show was a good idea ‘‘but it seems the
debaters have little respect for each other. Things got way
out of hand.”’

According to Kleine, the group hopes more people
will get involved so the show can feature a rotation of
different debaters.

“A different person from the four is chosen each
week to act as the mediator and break to commercials,”’
he said.

Usually at the end of each show the group chooses,
what they call, the ‘‘Goat’’ and the ‘‘Hero”’ of the week.

“The ‘Goat’ of the Week is the person each of us
feel has been most offensive that week,’’ Kleine said.
“The ‘Hero’ of the Week is someone who has done
something remarkable recently.”’ Jackson said the
four have learned about themselves from the debates.

“We've learned that we're not as liberal or
conservative as we think,’’ Jackson said. ‘‘You find out
that you can’t label people strictly liberal or conser-
vative.”’

Jackson added that he, Kleine, Kowalczuk and
Eggleston welcome callers and input from the audience.

“If you don’t become politically enlightened at
college,’’ Jackson said, ‘‘where will you?’’

Before coming to W&L in the fall of 1989,
Hall taught at Saint Lawrence University in New
York. Although he enjoyed his stay there, Hall said
he has found W&L to be more challenging in-
tellectually.

‘‘The students are more capable and engaging

‘There is still much room for diversity, both
nationally, and here at W&L,’’ Hall asserts. ‘‘The
only way for you to strengthen your perspective is
to be more aware of the opposing perspective.”’

Hall said one of the advantages of teaching
here is that he is allowed to pursue his interests
inside and outside of the classroom while enjoy-
ing a good deal of support.

‘“‘All of the teachers here are committed to
teaching, but they actively engage in research as
well,’’ Hall notes. ‘‘There is a reasonable balance

So while Hall continues to do both, he looks to
the end of the year, when his thesis will be com-
pleted. Will he continue his commute?

‘*As of now I plan to stay here.’’ Hall said.

He said he made up his mind
when the Alpha Phi Alpha represen-
tative told him that ‘‘few, if any’
black students pledge other than
historically black fraternities on cam-
puses where students have a choice.

‘The school, gradually, has been
moving in the right direction... The
establishment of a black house would
be a step backward,’’ Perkins said.

John Harris, one of three seniors
who spoke in favor of Alpha Phi
Alpha, disagreed.

“Try to relate to what we’re
going through [as black students],”’
Harris, a former member of Chi Psi,
said. ‘‘I gave it [the fraternity sys-
tem] a shot for two years. It was not
what I want in fraternity.’

Senior Courtney Penn said Alpha
Phi Alpha can meet needs for black
students that the current fraternity
system does not.

‘Blacks do not party in the same
kind of way whites [do]’’ he said.
Alpha Phi Alpha would ‘‘upgrade the
social life for blacks.

“This will make sure there is

Harris also echoed another point
Atkins made about integration at the

Administrators seek student help
in teaching responsible drinking

bers and pledges, extreme drunkenness, and behavior
resulting from alcohol abuse.

Howison mentioned physical violence, sexual assault,
driving under the influence and arrest as behavior re-
sulting from alcohol abuse.

Drinking among underage students and alcohol abuse
among faculty will not be addressed.

Howison identified fraternities as being major abusers
of alcohol and called on fraternity presidents and Inter-
fraternity Council members to suggest ways to use alcohol
more responsibly.

“We are especially targeting fraternities and sororities
to take an active role in solving this problem,’’ Howison
said.

Associate Dean of Students and Counseling Psycholog-
ist Anne Schroer-Lamont said that she would like to see
students suggest a plan similar to the one currently in
place at Dartmouth University.

According to Schroer-Lamont, students at Dartmouth
are assigned as ‘‘party monitors’’ and make sure that
guests do not get overly intoxicated.

‘‘We need to train student leaders to follow models on

how to party and not have physical or mental damage,”’
Schroer-Lamont said.

Howison said that much of the violent behavior that
often accompanies excessive alcohol use could be elimi-
nated if fraternities and sororities were more willing to
discipline their members.

“If someone knew that he would have to face
disciplinary action from the fraternity as well as the
Student Conduct Committee, that might be a sufficient
deterrent to breaking the rules,’’ Howison said.

Associate Dean of Students Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’
Atkins called on fraternity chapters to take a broader look
at alcohol problems in their chapters and not just focus
on violence and vandalism.

Atkins also emphasized that fraternities have a respon-
sibility to enforce laws in the IFC constitution.

‘‘The University is not going to move in and enforce
these laws unless the fraternities simply refuse to do it
themselves,’’ Atkins said.

Schroer-Lamont said students who are interested in

proposing ideas to combat alcohol abuse should attend a

meeting of the Student Health Education Committee. It
meets Thursdays in the Arlington Women Center.

‘Students need to learn how to drink without passing
out. That’s not healthy,’’ Schroer-Lamont said.

set up interviews, which will be held on Monday, Jan. 13, beginning at 8 p.m.
Contact Rick at 464-5518 with questions. This will be the mission of the new

 

 

magazine:

The magazine will present the
varied opinions and ideologies of
citizens of our community, nation,
and world. These pages, therefore,
will attempt to leap boundaries of
intellectual and social fragmentation
in the hope of encouraging lively,
educational debate and tolerance of
others’ views.

.A further mission will be to pub-
lish in depth, balanced essays of
interest to readers.

The magazine, under the au-
thority of the Washington and Lee
University Publications Board, is
published by students of Washington
and Lee University. The magazine
relies on financial support from ad-
vertisements and the university [st-
udent funds].

Since the magazine’s purpose is
to portray many varied opinions and
ideologies and to cover diverse is-
sues, it is independent from any
political party or special interest
group. Rather than push an ideologi-
cal or cultural agenda, the magazine

will aspire for a more general objec-

intelligent, interesting dicourse on
wide-ranging topics.

The views expressed in the opi-
nion section, including point/counter
point arguments, do not necessarily
reflect any opinion of the university,
the publications board, or the editors
of the magazine. The views presen-
ted in [staff] editorials represent the
general opinion of the editors.

The staff encourages students,
educators alumni, W&L staff mem-
bers and other readers to submit
inquiries, letters, articles, cartoons,
photographs, __political/social issue

will attempt to print all letters and
articles that it receives as long as
they are signed, intelligently written,
and in “good taste.” Final judgment
rests on the discretion of the editors.

The Ring-tum Phi, November 21, 1991

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

Over the past few years, the tradi-
tion has seemed to get away from the
Washington and Lee basketball pro-
gram. In 1991-92 head coach Verne
Canfield will try to put the tradition
back into W&L basketball.

‘‘We need to get back the neces-

sary pride and discipline that W&L
teams have had in the past,’’ said
Canfield, whose 429 career wins
place him among the all-time Di-
vision III leaders.
‘Ahead of him lies a formidable
task. Gone from last year’s 12-14
team are a group of seniors that
scored more points as a class than
any before it. Led by 1,000-point
scorers Chris Jacobs, Ed Hart and
Mike Holton, the senior class grad-
uated with 5,943 points.

Jacobs, Holton and Hart were all-
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
performers, and Jacobs was the
ODAC’s Player of the Year in 1989.
Craig Hatfield led the ODAC in
rebound in 1990. Pat Gallavan was
capable and did carry the team over
‘stretches with his three point shooting
yability. Jim Casey holds W&L’s
single-game record for three pointers
‘made with seven.

' While the task may not be easy,
‘Canfield is looking forward to mold-
‘ing a young team into one that will
exemplify what W&L basketball is all
about.

: ‘We've got a checklist of about
eight things that we want to do,”’
Canfield said. ‘‘All of them deal with
unselfish and hard, aggressive play.”’

' But more than just the statistics
‘ate gone. These players played the
majority of the minutes over the last
three seasons. That means the group
that will form this year’s nucleus will
be thrust into the limelight for the
first time.

‘When I say that we are young
and inexperienced, it’s not just a
cliche,’’ Canfield said. ‘‘Even our-
returning players haven’t had set
roles.”’

The leader will be captain Mark
Melton. The 6-foot-4 senior started
just four games last year, and will
have to adjust to a starting role. Last
year, he was Canfield’s ace in the
hole off the bench, playing as many
as four different positions.

‘*Mark is providing leadership we

haven’t had in a while,’’ said Can-
field. ‘‘He’s the type of player that
can sit on the bench and be a leader.
He’s a terrific team player.’

Senior Courtney Penn is the heir
apparent to Hatfield’s role of re-
bounder, defender and bruiser. At 6-
foot-4, Penn is a ferocious re-
bounder — he hauled in nine in just
19 minutes in last year’s 88-77 win
at Emory and Henry, and he just
might be the ODAC’s best defensive
forward.

‘*We won’t expect much from our
big men in terms of scoring,’’ said
Canfield. ‘‘We want our big men to
set screens, pass the ball back out to
our perimeter shooters, and rebound
and play post defense.’’

If this team has one strong area,
it should be the backcourt. The Gen-
erals return four guards, and Canfield
has found a couple of freshmen who
will blend into the rotation.

The point guard job belongs to
Bryan Brading. The 5-foot-8 junior
came on strong to close last season,
including back-to-back double figure
scoring games against Roanoke and
Eastern Mennonite.

‘‘He has developed in a short
period of time into one of the best
point guards we’ve ever had,’’ said
Canfield. ‘‘He will be called on to
set the table, and he can shoot the
three-pointer as well.”’

Along with Brading, sophomore
Paul Baker should see a lot of play-
ing time as the off-guard. Baker,
along with junior Bryan Watkins, was
a part-time starter at guard last year.

‘‘We've got some young guards
coming on,’’ said Canfield of the pre-
season workouts. ‘‘Baker is looking
good. We’ve got six people in the
backcourt, three at each position, who
could contribute this year.’’

The center position might be the
Generals’ biggest question mark. The
Generals return no one who has
played in the middle on the college
level. Sophomore Bryant Pless prac-
ticed at center last year, and he and
sophomore Robert Miggins will rotate
with two freshmen. Canfield says all
are unproven entities in the W&L
system.

‘There will be no stars in our
program,”’ said Canfield. ‘*Everyone
will have a set role, and it will be a
matter of meshing everyone’s roles
together. We’ve got eight or nine
players who will rotate. That has kept
everyone on their toes and ready to

Brading

play.’’

Canfield has been extremely
pleased with the way the team has
responded in the presesaon.

‘*This is my kind of team,’’ said
Canfield. ‘“‘They are very coachable,
and they are giving everything they
have on the court. I’m _ especially
pleased with our seniors. Mark and
Courtney have bent over backwards
to help the freshmen pick things up.’’

And the freshmen have picked
things up very well. After keeping six
freshmen on the roster, Canfield is
tossing around a Dean Smith-ian idea.

‘I’m thinking about playing five
freshman as a unit to go after it for
about a minute or two,’’ he said.
‘They definitely won’t embarrass
themselves out there.’’

Canfield has a young team, and
he knows that the team will make
mistakes. He can live with that.

‘‘We’ll make a ton of mistakes,”’
he said, ‘‘but they will be growth-
producing ones. I want to, see some
mistakes, because if we aren’t making
mistakes, that means we’re being too
cautious, and I want us to be aggres-
sive.”’

What he doesn’t know is how his
team will do in the won-loss depart-
ment, but Canfield won’t measure his
team’s success through just wins and
losses.

‘One thing is certain,’’ he said.
‘*We will go out and give it everyth-
ing we have each night, and after the
game we'll think about the next
game.”’

And it will be that effort that
eventually puts the tradition back in
W&L basketball.

‘*Sooner or later, the success will
develop,’’ Canfield said, ‘‘and people
will say W&L basketball is back.’’

Wrestlers look to veterans to
lead strong freshman class

 

From W&L Sports Information

 

Washington and Lee started the
wrestling season two weekends ago at
the VMI Keydet Invitational and will
return to action December 6-7 at the
Lebanon Valley Invitational, an event
that annually brings the top Division
III teams in the East together.

Head coach Gary Franke has
some talented upperclassmen this
year, but will also have to rely on
the youth of his team as five of the
10 weight classes will probably be
manned by freshmen.

The top returnee is senior co-
captain Peer Soderberg. The 177-
pounder has racked up three straight
winning seasons, including a 14-10
mark last year with a team-high nine
pins. Soderberg was injured at the
end of last year, but should make a
run at the Eastern Championships this
year.

The other co-captain is 126-
pounder Rich Paini. The junior had
three pins last year after posting a
team-high five as a freshman. He will
be making a move up from the 118-

pound weight class this year.

Three other returnees with ex-
perience include 190-pounder John
Conkling, heavyweight Stewart Green
and 134-pounder Doug Lamb. Con-
kling, a junior, has shown big im-
provement each year and finished
fourth at the VMI Keydet Invitational
in the heavyweight class.

Green, a junior, also plays football
for the Generals but had to sit out
this season with an injury. That lack
of activity should make him hungry
to return to the mat.

Lamb, also a junior, will battle
with freshman Adam Williams at the
134-pound class. Lamb wrestled at
both 134 and 142 last year and will
probably see action at both classes
again this year.

Franke has several talented fresh-
men, but expects the biggest damage
to come from Williams and 158-
pounder Lea Abercrombie. Williams
was a two-time district champion
wrestling at Cave Spring High School
in Roanoke and Abercrombie com-
piled a 35-9 record at George Wash-
ington High School in Danville.

The Generals early season lineup

should be as follows: freshman ohn
Cochran at 118 pounds, Paini at 126
pounds, either Lamb or Williams at
134 pounds, freshman John Cherry at
142 pounds, freshman Josh Helton at
150 pounds, Abercrombie at 158
pounds, freshman Beau King at 167
pounds, Soderberg at 177 pounds,
Conkling at 190 pounds and Green at
heavyweight.

After wrestling just three dual
matches last year (1-2 with a win
over Georgia Tech), the Generals will
have six duals this year: Davidson,
Greensboro, Anderson, Johns Hop-
kins, Western Maryland and cross-
state rival Longwood. In addition
W&L will take place in five in-sea-
son tournaments, including the 15th
annual Washington and Lee Invita-
tional in late January.

Another highlight of the schedule
will be the Virginia State II-III
Championships at Norfolk State in
early February.

The Generals had no state cham-
pions last year, but Peer Soderberg
finished in second place and three
Generals finished in third place, in-
cluding Conkling at heavyweight.

New sath
same results

From W&L Sports Information

 

 

Washington and Lee’s women’s
swimming season gets underway with
the dual meet challenge this weekend
at the Twombly Pool. It will be a big
early season test for the Generals as
Allegheny, Centre and Ithaca will all
come to Lexington.

The swimming program at W&L
has undergone a facelift this year,
with Kiki Jacobs taking over as the
women’s head coach. But you can
expect some of the same results from
W&L as you've seen in the past.

Jacobs inherits a women’s team
that has won four straight Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference titles and
last year won its first Atlantic States
tile. Two key returnees from last
year’s championship team are senior
captain Jodi Herring and junior Claire
Dudley, a national qualifier last year.

Herring was W&L’s freestyle
specialist, notching W&L’s season-
best times in the 200, 500, 1000 and
1650 free. The three-time All-ODAC
performer won the 200, 500 and 1650
free titles at last year’s Atlantic
States Championships and she is a
member of every one of W&L’s
school record relay event teams.

Dudley qualified for the nationals
in the 200 breaststroke last year after
earning All-America honors as a
freshman. She holds six school re-
cords, including individual records in
the 100 breast, 200 breast, 200 in-
dividual medley and 400 IM.

Three other returning letterwinners
that will aid the Generals’ cause are
senior Louise Adamson, and soph-
omores Jeanette Burgess and Kari
May.

Remillard’s expectations
high for young swimmers

 

By Sean O’Rourke
Staff Reporter

 

As most students head home for
Thanksgiving, the last thing on their
minds is hitting the water to swim.

But for some students who choose
to stay in Lexington, swimming is the
only thing on their minds.

The Washington and Lee men’s
swimming team will open its 1991-
92 season by taking on Allegheny,
Centre and Ithaca this coming week-
end.

The three meets at Twombly Pool
will mark the thirteenth year of
men’s swimming under the leadership
of coach Page Remillard. After a
tough season last year, the veteran
coach is excited about this year.

“T have a lot of optimism about
this year,’’ he said. ‘‘I can just tell
things are going to go well. We've
been working hard and everyone’s
goals are the same. Now we just
have to implement those goals.’’

Remillard also feels that this
season will be much different from
last season.

‘Last year was a struggle for
us,’’ explained the coach. ‘‘This
year it’s going to be a struggle for
the other teams.”’

The other teams will be facing a
very young Generals team. W&L
will field a team with 10 freshmen,
four sophomores, three juniors and
one senior.

The talented crop of freshmen
bring new blood and enthusiasm to
the team, but they also carry a degree
of inexperience with them. Even so,

Remillard is still expecting a great
deal out of them.

“I’m expecting a lot from the
freshmen group,’’ Remillard said. ‘‘I
need Doug Brown [the only senior]
to lead them because he’s been
through it all. There’s a big dif-
ference between collegiate swimming
and high school swimming.

‘‘The freshmen will be the nu-
cleus of this team, but right now,
they need to gain experience,’’ he
said.

Brown won't be the only one
Remillard will rely on. Juniors Chris
Hagge, Marc Lotano and Andrew
Pearson will have to carry some of
the burden throughout the season.
The sophomores won't be ignored
either.

Even if Remillard seems unsure
about the team’s experience, he’s not
unsure about his team’s speed.

“I think our kids will be sur-
prised at how fast they’re swimm-
ing,’’ he said. ‘‘They’ve been work-
ing hard and their times are good. I
feel we’re real strong in the freestyie
events, but we’re still untested in the
stroke events [breaststroke, backstroke
and butterfly].”’

With such a young group, Remil-
lard says his expectations are reason-
able.

“T want to have a_ winning
season, and I want to get guys to the
nationals,’’ he said. ‘‘I think, looking
at the team, that we have a great
chance to accomplish both.”’

The Dec. 4 meet against VMI will
be the student body’s first chance to
look at the team while school is in
session.

Defense leads way to year’s only win

WIN from page 8

 

the first eight games of the season
before moving back to defense, where
he played for his first two and a half
years.

‘“‘The move wasn’t that tough for
me,”’ he said. ‘‘The players and the
coaches were patient in teaching me
the system. It wasn’t that big of a
change since I had played before. I
just needed a refresher course.’’

Kiehl said the win to end the

season was as rewarding a win as he
could ever get.

“It doesn’t get much better than
this,’ he said. ‘‘But it’s tough to
play that well and realize that you
don’t have any more games to play.”’

“It was the perfect way to end up
a season like we had,’’ said Fallon.
“The seniors feel good because they
won their last game, and the younger
players are excited about next year.’’

Fallon said that the team never
gave up during the season.

‘*We never slacked off,’’ he said.

“They believed in preparing and they
gave everything they had. The Guil-
ford game indicated that. We were
down 25-0 at the half and could have
packed it in. But we didn’t. We came
out and hit hard and shut them out.
The kids hung tough all year, and
they deserve credit for that.

“‘We knew the last game was
going to be tough. They were a good
team. It was a challenge,’’ Fallon
said. ‘‘I guess it was a storybook
finish to our season.”’

Freshman William Propst breaks a tackle on his way to a 61-yard
gain in W&L’s 27-12 win over Georgetown.

 

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

The Georgetown University foot-
ball team must be sick of seeing the
Washington and Lee Generals line up
across from them — especially when
the Generals have extra incentive to
win the game.

In 1975, the Generals went into
the last game of the year looking for
their first win, and got it against the
Hoyas 28-26.

In each of the past two seasons,
the Generals have needed to beat the
Hoyas to keep from having a losing
season. Each time they succeeded.

And this season, the Generals
needed to beat the Hoyas to eam
their first win of the season.

‘‘T guess we have their number,”’
said a jubilant Greg Kiehl as the
Generals left Kehoe Field Saturday
after a 27-12 win to salvage the
season with a 1-9 record.

The Generals scored 21 points in
the last four minutes of the first half
and intercepted the nation’s best
passing offense seven times to eam
the win.

“It’s been a tough fall,’’ said
senior comerback-turned-quarterback-
turned-cornerback-again Fred Ren-
neker. ‘‘No one ever wanted to give
up during the season, and it finally
was our tum to win.”’

The defense dominated all day
long for the Generals, mostly because
of a new package that defensive
coordinator Frank Méiriello installed
especially for Georgetown.

‘‘We went with a dime package,”’
he said. ‘‘We thought we could
match-up better with two extra defen-
sive backs for two reasons. One, it
gave us better coverage, and two, it
gave us better speed coming off the
corner on a blitz. It was pretty effec-
tive.’’

The Generals blitzed the Hoyas
relentlessly and successfully all after-
noon, much to the delight of a sur-
prisingly pro-W&L crowd.

“It was wierd that we had more

fans at the game than they did,’’ said
Kiehl. ‘‘But it was great to see
everyone cheering and singing ‘The
Swing’ when we scored.”’

Led by senior defensive end John
McCallum, the Generals sacked Geor-
getown quarterbacks eight times, and
when they didn’t sack them, they
intercepted them a_ school-record
seven times.

‘*Sometimes the best pass defense
is a good rush,’’ said head coach
Gary Fallon. ‘‘We put all kinds of
pressure on them and forced them to
throw when they didn’t want to.”’

All of the interceptions came off
of backup quarterback Bill Jenkinson,
who took when Aley Demarest left
the game with a separated shoulder
late in the second quarter after he
was hit by freshman defensive tackle
Jason Chartrand.

Neither was effective on the day.
Demarest completed just three of 10
passes before he left, and Jenkinson
seemed like W&L’s best weapon,
completing just 12 passes to his own
teammates.

‘Once we got the interceptions,”’
Fallon said, ‘‘we really got rolling.’’

W&L trailed 3-0 when Demarest
left the game. After Jenkinson
couldn’t move the Hoyas on his first
try, the Generals took over on their
own 28-yard line.

Operating out of the run and
shoot offense, on third down at the
W&L 35, freshman quarterback Geren
Steiner hit freshman wide receiver
William Propst for a 61-yard gain to
the Georgetown four-yard line.

Two plays later, junior fullback
Mark Goglia blasted into the end
zone to give the Generals their first
lead since the second week of the
season against Alabama-Birmingham,
7-3 with 4:26 left in the half.

The Hoyas intercepted Steiner on
the Generals’ next possession but
immediatley returned the favor, open-
ing the floodgates for the Generals.

On the next play from scrimmage,
sophomore cornerback Bill Harker
picked off Jenkinson’s pass and re-
turned it to the Georgetown 35.

Hannah, Edwards qualify for national meet

 

By Jacob Kimball
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
and women’s cross country teams
emerged from the Southeastern Re-
gional meet with honors for their
respective top runners.

Bo Hannah and Charles Edwards
earned berths at the National Cham-
pionship meet by finishing fourth and
seventh respectively in a field of
eighty-five competitors. Kim Herring
became the first W&L female all-
region runner. She earned the honor
with her 13th-place finish.

‘Bo and I were both very close
to making it to nationals last year,’’
said Edwards. ‘‘We really wanted it
this year and getting so close [last
year] gave us extra momentum.”’

Edwards’ time of 26:22 along
with Hannah's time of 25:51 were the
best times each had ever recorded.

Also running personal best races
were Keith Rinn, who landed a 16th-
place finish in a time of 27:10, and

Lee Parker whose 27:28 time placed
him 20th overall.

Matthew Brock rounded out the
solid team performance which gave
the Generals a fourth place overall
finish out of twelve teams represent-
ing the competitive region that ex-
tends west to the Mississippi River
and north to the Virginia border.

W&L finished with 92 points,
trailing only Mary Washington Col-
lege, Emory University, and the stel-
lar Lynchburg team that recorded a
score of 35.

Head coach John Tucker said,
‘‘Considering that 67 points won it
last year, Lynchburg just ran an in-
credible race.”’

The women also ran against stiff
competition, yet managed an eighth
place finish out of seventeen schools.
Once again Kim Herring paced the
team, finishing with a time of 19:49.
Herring, W&L’s best first-year runner
ever, already has seven of W&L’s
top times ever, and has run all but
one of her races under 22:00 this
year.

Nicole Casteel capped an excel-
lent season with her seventh consecu-
tive second place finish on the team
with a time of 20:53. Diedre Dene-
chaud showed that she is the most
improved runner on the team by
placing third. She was only placed on
the traveling squad at mid-season.

Sue Deutsch and Brandi Hender-
son rounded out the top five. Cap-
tain Jodi Herring ran a competitive
race to culminate a season-long battle
with her health, said coach Jim
Phemister.

Her hard work and determination
inspired and led the young team that
improved steadily throughout the
year, and with all of the top five
runners returning, the Generals plan
on returning to the thick of the hunt
for the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference championship.

As the women lay designs on next
year, Hannah and Edwards prepare
themselves for the biggest race of
their lives.

Edwards, a senior co-captain, was
quick to acknowledge the role Tucker

played in their success.

‘We both improved a great deal
this year, and that can be attributed
to Coach’s intensity,’’ he said.

Tucker worked the team harder
than previous seasons, and the rig-
orous training is paying dividends for
the duo.

“TI could not be prouder,’’ he
said. ‘‘They did everything I asked of
them and more. It is quite an ac-
complishment just to make it to na-
tionals.”’

They each know that it will be a
tough NCAA field, but they are ready
to meet the challenge.

‘‘T know what I have to do and
who I have to stay with,’’ said Han-
nah, who has led W&L in every race
this year. ‘‘It is just a matter of
doing it.’’

Edwards is preparing to make his
last race his best one.

‘*The field will be so much more
competitive, but I am just going to
go out as fast as I can and give it
everything I have,’’ he said.

Given a reprieve, Steiner found
senior Jeff Kreis for a 27-yard gain
to the eight-yard line to start the
drive, and then capped it with a five-
yard scoring pass to sophomore Wil-
son Moore.

W&L took a commanding lead on
Georgetown’s first play after the
kickoff. Renneker intercepted Jenkin-
son’s pass and returned it 25 yards
for a touchdown, giving the Generals
a 21-3 halftime lead.

“The receiver just ran a stop
route, and the ball was supposed to
be there when the receiver got
there,’’ Renneker said. ‘‘I just hap-
pened to be there, and the ball hit me
in the chest. I looked up and there
was nothing in front of me but green
turf.”’

Renneker’s score had the Generals
celebrating as they left the field for
halftime, and that concerned Fallon.

‘‘Fred’s was a big, big play,’’
said Fallon. ‘‘All of our success came
so quickly, but we still had a whole
half to play. We hadn’t won anything
at that point.”’

Both teams struggled offensively
to start the second half. Georgetown
managed a third quarter field goal to
cut into the Generals’ lead, and then
struck again with their defense early
in the fourth quarter.

Jim Bolger intercepted Steiner’s
first down pass and returned it 34
yards for Georgetown’s only touch-
down, cutting the lead to 21-12. The
Hoyas went for the two-point conver-
sion, but McCallum hit Jenkinson as
he tried to pass and broke up the
play.

The Generals’ defense then took
over. W&L intercepted Jenkinson the
last three times Georgetown had the
ball. Freshman Jon Wagner’s inter-
ception helped set up the Generals’
final touchdown.

After the Generals abandoned the
run and shoot to eat up more time,
junior Wade Robinett carried for nine
yards to the Georgetown 28, and
Kreis carried for 26 more on a re-
verse to the two-yard line. On the
next play, freshman fullback Matthew

Mogk powered in for the touchdown
that iced the game, 27-12.

‘It was a nice victory for our
kids,”’ said Fallon. ‘‘Especially for
the seniors I’m tickled to death.”’

On the day, the W&L offense
registered a season-high 305 yards.
The offensive line anchored by sen-
iors Steve Fugitte and Jim Henry
gave Steiner enough time to pass for
235 yards, 134 of which went to
Propst, and the defense held Geor-
getown's passing attack to just 105
yards. The Hoyas entered the game
averaging 307 yards passing per
game.

Renneker and Harker each had
two interceptions, and Wagner, senior
Scott Williamson and freshman Marc
Newman each had one.

McCallum made seven tackles,
had four sacks, registered three tack-
les-for-losses and forced a fumble to
lead the way.

‘We had a hey day rushing the
quarterback,’ said Kiehl, W&L’s
senior nose guard. ‘‘It must have
been scary for their quarterbacks to
go back and pass. McCallum was all
over the place, and the rest of us
weren’t far behind him.’’

Of the Generals’ sacks, junior Phil
Spears and senior Scott Williamson
each had two and Kiehl and junior
Lyle Smith each added one of their
own,

‘The pressure our line put on
was the key,’’ said Renneker. ‘‘When
you can pressure the quarterback and
make him worry, it makes a tremen-
dous difference in the game.”’

Fallon said that the had a good
idea of how to stop the Hoyas’ pass-
ing attack.

“‘Since we were running the run
and shoot, we did a lot of things that
they did,’’ he said. ‘‘We knew what
would give us trouble, and that gave
them trouble too. And the defensive
coaches came up with a great game
plan.”’

Renneker should know what pres-
sure can do to a quarterback. He

THE ALPHA PHI ALPHA VOTE

  

IFC votes to OK colonization
of proposed black fraternity

Alpha Phi Alpha, the historically black
fraternity, has IFC endorsement to colonize
at Washington and Lee after an IFC vote
of 11-4 in favor, IFC President Greg Hicks
said at the council meeting tonight.

The 11-4 vote represents 73 and one-
third percent of the voting council mem-
bers, slightly short of the constitutionally
mandated three-quarters approval.

But under Robert's Rules of Orders,
which govern the IFC under the council’s
constitution, that difference may be roun-
ded, depending on precedents set by the
voting body, according to Lewis LaRue,
alumni professor of law.

Hicks could not be reached for com-
‘ment after he left the University Center
tonight and before 9 p.m. press time.

Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Kappa Sigma,
Pi Kappa Alpha and Sigma Chi voted
against the new chapter. Sigma Alpha
Epsilon was absent.

According to IFC Treasurer Thomas
Snedeker, SAE President Gene Pride was
late to the meeting and said he would have
voted in favor of Alpha.

Phi Kapp President Marc Short said
one argument against Alpha was that it
might segregate the campus. He also said
that any house voting against Alpha would
have to commit to improving the social
lives of W&L’s black students, if Alpha
did not pass.

Sigma Nu President Heath Dixon voted
in favor of Alpha, though he said he hopes
historically single-race fraternities will
become obsolete as all fraternities become
racially integrated.

opportunity for black students on campus

Freshman William Propst breaks a tackle on his way to a 61-yard
gain in W&L’s 27-12 win over Georgetown.

 

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

The Georgetown University foot-
ball team must be sick of seeing the
Washington and Lee Generals line up
across from them — especially when
the Generals have extra incentive to
win the game.

In 1975, the Generals went into
the last game of the year looking for
their first win, and got it against the
Hoyas 28-26.

In each of the past two seasons,
the Generals have needed to beat the
Hoyas to keep from having a losing
season. Each time they succeeded.

And this season, the Generals
needed to beat the Hoyas to eam
their first win of the season.

“*T guess we have their number,”’
said a jubilant Greg Kiehl as the
Generals left Kehoe Field Saturday
after a 27-12 win to salvage the
season with a 1-9 record.

The Generals scored 21 points in
the last four minutes of the first half
and intercepted the nation’s best
passing offense seven times to earn
the win.

“It’s been a tough fall,’’ said
senior cornerback-turned-quarterback-
turned-cornerback-again Fred Ren-
neker. ‘‘No one ever wanted to give
up during the season, and it finally
was our turn to win.’’

The defense dominated all day
long for the Generals, mostly because
of a new package that defensive
coordinator Frank Miriello installed
especially for Georgetown.

‘‘We went with a dime package,”’
he said. ‘‘We thought we could
match-up better with two extra defen-
sive backs for two reasons. One, it
gave us better coverage, and two, it
gave us better speed coming off the
comer on a blitz. It was pretty effec-
tive.’’

The Generals blitzed the Hoyas
relentlessly and successfully all after-
noon, much to the delight of a sur-
prisingly pro-W&L crowd.

“It was wierd that we had more

fans at the game than they did,’’ said
Kiehl. ‘‘But it was great to see
everyone cheering and singing ‘The
Swing’ when we scored.”’

Led by senior defensive end John
McCallum, the Generals sacked Geor-
getown quarterbacks eight times, and
when they didn’t sack them, they
intercepted them a_ school-record
seven times,

‘*Sometimes the best pass defense
is a good mush,’’ said head coach
Gary Fallon. ‘‘We put all kinds of
pressure on them and forced them to
throw when they didn’t want to.”’

All of the interceptions came off
of backup quarterback Bill Jenkinson,
who took when Aley Demarest left
the game with a separated shoulder
late in the second quarter after he
was hit by freshman defensive tackle
Jason Chartrand.

Neither was effective on the day.
Demarest completed just three of 10
passes before he left, and Jenkinson
seemed like W&L’s best weapon,
completing just 12 passes to his own
teammates.

*‘Once we got the interceptions,”’
Fallon said, ‘‘we really got rolling.’’

W&L trailed 3-0 when Demarest
left the game. After Jenkinson
couldn’t move the Hoyas on his first
try, the Generals took over on their
own 28-yard line.

Operating out of the run and
shoot offense, on third down at the
W&L 35, freshman quarterback Geren
Steiner hit freshman wide receiver
William Propst for a 61-yard gain to
the Georgetown four-yard line.

Two plays later, junior fullback
Mark Goglia blasted into the end
zone to give the Generals their first
lead since the second week of the
season against Alabama-Birmingham,
7-3 with 4:26 left in the half.

The Hoyas intercepted Steiner on
the Generals’ next possession but
immediatley returned the favor, open-
ing the floodgates for the Generals.

On the next play from scrimmage,
sophomore cornerback Bill Harker
picked off Jenkinson’s pass and re-
tumed it to the Georgetown 35,

Hannah, Edwards qualify for national meet

The Washington and Lee men’s
and women’s cross country teams
emerged from the Southeastern Re-
gional meet with honors for their
respective top runners.

Bo Hannah and Charles Edwards
earned berths at the National Cham-
pionship meet by finishing fourth and
seventh respectively in a field of
eighty-five competitors. Kim Herring
became the first W&L female all-
region runner. She earned the honor
with her 13th-place finish.

‘Bo and I were both very close
to making it to nationals last year,”’
said Edwards. ‘‘We really wanted it
this year and getting so close [last
year] gave us extra momentum.”’

Edwards’ time of 26:22 along
with Hannah’s time of 25:51 were the
best times each had ever recorded.

Also running personal best races
were Keith Rinn, who landed a 16th-
place finish in a time of 27:10, and

Lee Parker whose 27:28 time placed
him 20th overall.

Matthew Brock rounded out the
solid team performance which gave
the Generals a fourth place overall
finish out of twelve teams represent-
ing the competitive region that ex-
tends west to the Mississippi River
and north to the Virginia border.

W&L finished with 92 points,
trailing only Mary Washington Col-
lege, Emory University, and the stel-
lar Lynchburg team that recorded a
score of 35.

Head coach John Tucker said,
‘‘Considering that 67 points won it
last year, Lynchburg just ran an in-
credible race.’’

The women also ran against stiff
competition, yet managed an eighth
place finish out of seventeen schools.
Once again Kim Herring paced the
team, finishing with a time of 19:49.
Herring, W&L’s best first-year runner
ever, already has seven of W&L’s
top times ever, and has run all but
one of her races under 22:00 this
year.

Nicole Casteel capped an excel-
lent season with her seventh consecu-
tive second place finish on the team
with a time of 20:53. Diedre Dene-
chaud showed that she is the most
improved runner on the team by
placing third. She was only placed on
the traveling squad at mid-season.

Sue Deutsch and Brandi Hender-
son rounded out the top five. Cap-
tain Jodi Herring ran a competitive
race to culminate a season-long battle
with her health, said coach Jim
Phemister.

Her hard work and determination
inspired and led the young team that
improved steadily throughout the
year, and with all of the top five
runners returning, the Generals plan
on returning to the thick of the hunt
for the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference championship.

As the women lay designs on next
year, Hannah and Edwards prepare
themselves for the biggest race of
their lives.

Edwards, a senior co-captain, was
quick to acknowledge the role Tucker

played in their success.

‘‘We both improved a great deal
this year, and that can be attributed
to Coach’s intensity,’’ he said.

Tucker worked the team harder
than previous seasons, and the rig-
orous training is paying dividends for
the duo.

‘I could not be prouder,’’ he
said. ‘‘They did everything I asked of
them and more. It is quite an ac-
complishment just to make it to na-
tionals.”’ ;

They each know that it will be a
tough NCAA field, but they are ready
to meet the challenge.

‘I know what I have to do and
who I have to stay with,’’ said Han-
nah, who has led W&L in every race
this year. ‘‘It is just a matter of
doing it.’’

Edwards is preparing to make his
last race his best one.

‘*The field will be so much more
competitive, but I am just going to
go out as fast as I can and give it
everything I have,’’ he said.

Given a reprieve, Steiner found
senior Jeff Kreis for a 27-yard gain
to the eight-yard line to start the
drive, and then capped it with a five-
yard scoring pass to sophomore Wil-
son Moore.

W&L took a commanding lead on
Georgetown’s first play after the
kickoff. Renneker intercepted Jenkin-
son’s pass and returned it 25 yards
for a touchdown, giving the Generals
a 21-3 halftime lead.

“The receiver just ran a stop
route, and the ball was supposed to
be there when the receiver got
there,’’ Renneker said. ‘‘I just hap-
pened to be there, and the ball hit me
in the chest. I looked up and there
was nothing in front of me but green
turf.’’

Renneker’s score had the Generals
celebrating as they left the field for
halftime, and that concerned Fallon.

‘‘Fred’s was a big, big play,’’
said Fallon. ‘‘All of our success came
so quickly, but we still had a whole
half to play. We hadn’t won anything
at that point.”’

Both teams struggled offensively
to start the second half. Georgetown
managed a third quarter field goal to
cut into the Generals’ lead, and then
struck again with their defense early
in the fourth quarter.

Jim Bolger intercepted Steiner's
first down pass and returned it 34
yards for Georgetown’s only touch-
down, cutting the lead to 21-12. The
Hoyas went for the two-point conver-
sion, but McCallum hit Jenkinson as
he tried to pass and broke up the
play.

The Generals’ defense then took
over. W&L intercepted Jenkinson the
last three times Georgetown had the
ball. Freshman Jon Wagner’s inter-
ception helped set up the Generals’
final touchdown.

After the Generals abandoned the
run and shoot to eat up more time,
junior Wade Robinett carried for nine
yards to the Georgetown 28, and
Kreis carried for, 26 more on a. re-
verse to the two-yard ‘line. On the
next play, freshman fullback Matthew

Mogk powered in for the touchdown
that iced the game, 27-12.

“‘It_ was a nice victory for our
kids,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘Especially for
the seniors I’m tickled to death.’’

On the day, the W&L offense
registered a season-high 305 yards.
The offensive line anchored by sen-
iors Steve Fugitte and Jim Henry
gave Steiner enough time to pass for
235 yards, 134 of which went to
Propst, and the defense held Geor-
getown’s passing attack to just 105
yards. The Hoyas entered the game
averaging 307 yards passing per
game.

Renneker and Harker each had
two interceptions, and Wagner, senior
Scott Williamson and freshman Marc
Newman each had one.

McCallum made seven tackles, ¢

had four sacks, registered three tack-
les-for-losses and forced a fumble to
lead the way.

*‘We had a hey day rushing the y

quarterback,’’ said Kiehl, W&L’s
senior nose guard. ‘‘It must have
been scary for their quarterbacks to
go back and pass. McCallum was all
over the place, and the rest of us
weren’t far behind him.”’

Of the Generals’ sacks, junior Phil
Spears and senior Scott Williamson
each had two and Kiehl and junior
Lyle Smith each added one of their
own.

‘The pressure our line put on
was the key,’’ said Renneker. ‘‘When
you can pressure the quarterback and
make him worry, it makes a tremen-
dous difference in the game.’’

Fallon said that the had a good
idea of how to stop the Hoyas’ pass-
ing attack.

‘Since we were running the run
and shoot, we did a lot of things that
they did,’’ he said. ‘‘We knew what
would give us trouble, and that gave
them trouble too. And the defensive
coaches came up with a great game
plan.’’

sure can do to a quarterback. He

MC on

budget

Mock Convention remains in
stronger financial shape than its 1988
predecessor while providing more
speakers and other activities, said MC
Treasurer Jay Darden.

““We’re spending very well and
getting a lot more for our money,”’
Darden said.

He said MC’s mailings and
phone-a-thon bring in revenue daily,
and funds raised last spring term
have also increased revenue, giving
this MC greater financial resources
than the previous one.

 

‘*We have
access to a
great deal
more money
than the last
convention
had,’’ Darden
said.

While MC
spent about
$136,000 in
1988, this con-
vention expects
to spend bet-
ween $175,000 and $190,000, Darden
said. So far, MC has spent about
$30,000 to $35,000, he said. The
convention has about $95,000 remain-
ing and expects individual states to
raise the final $40,000, Darden said.

“Each state is responsible for
raising the money to supply its own
activities,’ Darden said. ‘‘If they
raise less than that, then they will
make do with less.’’

The convention's greatest expenses
have come from new offerings to the
student body, Darden said. He cited
events like the November Presidential
Gala and the Spring Kickoff.

‘‘For Spring Kickoff, we spent a
little less money [than the 1988 con-
vention] and provided more for stu-
dents,’’ Darden said.

Alpha awaits OK
from nationals

IFC votes 11-4

By Rick Peltz
Editor

 

 

Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity may
begin colonization at Washington and
Lee whenever it is ready, but that
will not be until 1992-93, if at all.

The Interfraternity Council voted
11-4 on Nov. 21 to approve re-es-
tablishment of the W&L chapter of
the historically black fraternity.

Now the proposed chapter must
receive approval from the national
fraternity at its next convention in the
summer of 1992, according to Karen
Sullivan, a spokesman in Alpha’s
membership department in Baltimore.

If Alpha does open here for 1992-
93, it still will not participate in fall
Rush, as its academic requirements
will bar freshmen until winter term.
So the soonest Alpha will solicit
freshman members is 1993.

Sullivan said Wednesday that
Alpha’s national Committee on Stan-
dards and Extension will review the
proposed W&L chapter to determine
“if there’s a need for it,’’ she said.

‘‘There’s no guarantee it'll be
approved,’’ Sullivan said.

Meanwhile, Alpha has met all the
requirements of the W&L fraternity
system.

The IFC vote in favor of Alpha
represents 73 and one-third percent
of the voting council members, just
short of the constitutionally-mandated
three-fourths.

Under Robert's Rules of Order,
which governs IFC under the coun-
cil’s constitution, the difference may
be rounded if a precedent of rounding
has been set, according to Lewis La-
Rue, alumni law professor.

IFC President Greg Hicks said
Tuesday he did not know at the time
of the vote that 11 out of 15 was
less than 75 percent. But he said he
is comfortable with setting the prece-
dent of rounding, because 11 out of
15 is closer to three-fourths than 12

out of 15 is.

Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Kappa
Sigma, Pi Kappa Alpha and Sigma
Chi voted against Alpha.

IFC Treasurer Thomas Snedeker
said SAE President Gene Pride was
late to the meeting but said when he
arrived he would have voted in favor
of Alpha.

Hicks announced his support for
Alpha at an IFC meeting on Nov. 12,
11 days after the Student Affairs
Committee approved Alpha.

‘*This school is big on student
autonomy,’’ Hicks told IFC. ‘‘To get
[Alpha] turned down goes against a
lot of what this school stands for,’’
because students are petitioning to
bring Alpha, he said.

Senior Courtney Penn, one of the
petitioners for Alpha, said Wednes-
day that the re-establishment of the
fraternity represents his most im-
portant contribution to W&L in his
four years here.

‘*We’ve worked hard,’’ Penn said.
“This will be a pretty big graduation
present.”’

Sophomore Maurice Cole, a black
student who attended the vote, said
that the vote on Alpha was a step
forward for W&L.

“It’s a positive statement being
sent out that the other houses and the
school in general will not neglect a

the latest possible start. So we were
left with shortening Christmas break
to two weeks,’’ Dittman said.

The committee, which is com-
prised of five appointed faculty mem-
bers, proposes the schedules several
years ahead of time. The university
faculty must approve the recommend-
ed calendars.

Over the past few years, several
proposed amendments to the current
system have been rejected by the
faculty, or were not supported by
student who were polled, Dittman
said.

Suggested changes have included
creating a three-day weekend in Oc-
tober and starting school earlier, he
said.

The schedule currently includes
two 12-week terms and a six-week
term in the spring. In addition to
December break, the calendar allows
for 10-day breaks before spring term,
during Thanksgiving and for Wash-
ington’s birthday in February.

Dittman said calendars have been
scheduled through the 1995-96 school
year, and those will remain un
changed unless some new ideas are
addressed by the committee.

Superdance 1992 will make a donation to MDA in the name
of Andrew Slay, son of Joe Slay, '72. The boy has spinal
muscular dystrophy.

 

 

dance will raise money for one of
W&L’s own this year, according to a
press release from Superdance Co-
Chairman Fred Renneker.

All proceeds from this year’s
event will go to the Muscular Dystro-
phy Association in the name of And-
rew Slay, the five-year-old son of Joe
Slay, ’72, Renneker said. Andrew is
confined to a wheelchair because he
suffers from spinal muscular dystrop-
hy, a neuromuscular disorder.

Superdance grossed more than
$30,000 last year. Renneker said the
goal is to raise even more money this
year.

Superdance Co-Chairman Laura
Hendrey said researchers are close to
finding the gene which causes MD.

‘‘They’ve narrowed it down from
three billion possible genes to just
two million, and that means it’s real-
ly within striking distance,”’ she said.

Superdance, which will be held
Feb. 8-9 in the pavilion, will feature
a ‘‘Battle of the Bands’’ and a dance
band Friday night. On Saturday night,
the winner of Friday’s contest will
open for The Truly Dangerous
Swamp Band.

 

 

Two top-level Soviet economists
will spend next Monday and Tuesday
lecturing at Washington and Lee.

Vladimir Koblov and Yuri Yare-
menko will give two public lectures
as part of the newly created William
Lyne Wilson II Symposium Series.

Koblov, acting chairman of the
State Military Industrial Commission,
is a member of the Soviet cabinet.
He is charged with changing the
Soviet economy from a military base
to civilian control.

Koblov will speak at 7:30 p.m.
Monday in Commerce School 327 on
“The Political Economy of Reform.’’

Yaremenko, chief economic ad-
visor to the State Council, is charged
with reorganizing the Soviet economy
from a command base to a competi-
tive free market.

Yaremenko will speak at 7:30
pm. Tuesday in C-School 327 on
‘The Political Economy of Crisis.’’
. Arriving Saturday, just ahead of a
threatened Soviet pilot’s strike, they
will spend until Wednesday meeting
with classes and having dinner with
faculty and students.

“It is very unusual for cabinet-
level officials to travel out of the
country for so long,’’ Program Direc-
tor Craig McCaughrin said. ‘‘They
will be traveling directly to Boston to
sign the latest Soviet aid package.”’

The two Russians will be accom-
panied by official interpreter Oksana
Kozhina. Kozhina was an exchange
student at W&L last year.

“*T think the credit for setting all
this up really goes to Oksana for
being our contact,’’ McCaughrin said.

William Lyne Wilson I, '27, the
grandson of the late University Presi-
dent William Lyne Wilson, was a
frequent W&L benefactor before his
death in November 1989.

Now you know
how it feels

Well now, it seems our fine hosts in this fair city have gotten
a little taste of their own medicine, and it doesn’t look like they
like it a bit.

The Lexington City Council and many area residents have
been in a tizzy of late over Adelphia Cable’s $3.00 rate hike.
Mayor H.E.‘‘Buddy’’ Derrick spent most of a recent council
meeting whining that the increase was unfair and unjustified,
and, darnit, he was mad.

‘The city is powerless,’’ he said. ‘‘We’ve scheduled a public
hearing to amass public opinion to show [Adelphia] that people
disagree with what I consider to be an excessive increase.”’

What we find funny is that he and his compatriots seem most
upset over the fact that they have no control over the cable
company’s rate schedule. Lexington’s contract with Adelphia is
not up for review until 2003, and short of suing the cable
operator, it looks like viewers can’t do a thing except sit back,
pay their three bucks, and enjoy the moder miracle of cable
television.

Let’s look into our scrapbook and see if we can’t remember
the last time people around here were upset that they were being
charged a fee they had no way of avoiding and no say in
implementing.

Here it is, just a few pages back. It seems the ol’ Lexington
City Council itself thought it would be a great solution to its
budget problems if it started charging W&L and VMI students
a tax on their personal property.

“Yeah, why don’t we tax their cars,’’ the council reasoned.
“Since students don’t have any say in city government, we can
force the students to pay anything we want. And the best part
of the plan is those rich little kids can’t do a thing about it.’’

Now we’re not so sure we’re on the side of Adelphia.
Unregulated monopolies do tend to do bad things, but somehow,
we’re just plum out of sympathy for our city council members
and their fearless leader, Buddy.

Dear Santa,

We know it’s still 20 days till Christmas, but since this is our
last issue until January, we figured we’d better get in our wish
list now. We’re not asking for much this year, things have been
going pretty well for us. However, there are a few other people
we know that could use a thing or two. They might not include
these things on their own. lists, but we know what they really
need: :

For President Wilson: a colonnade of his very own on which to
build as many art galleries as he wants.

*For Brian Shaw: a red-phone hotline to the Phi office so he can
alter or spike any story he feels might jeopardize the good
name of Washington and Lee.

*For the Generals: a one-game season, preferably only a last
game season.

*For the EC: a reserve reserve fund.

*For Pi Phi: a oor a .

*For the student body: magazines! magazines! magazines!

*For the IFC: a calculator.

*For Dean Elrod: a new schedule book so he won’t be able to
complain if he misses another deadline.

Quote of the Week

Imelda, Part Two:

She made a surprise farwell visit Saturday to her late husband's
shed-like wooden crypt outside Honolulu. After aides opened the
tomb and then the casket, she spent more than an hour with the
corpse. She wept, prayed, dabbed its shiny forehead, held its stiff
hand, ran her fingers through its black wig and whispered in its
waxen ear. She twice invited photographers up to the wooden
platform to record the ghoulish scene.

Jolly old Santa Claus in Lexington? Join in singing as Swann gets the perfect gift

 

LET IT RIDE
By Chris Swann

 

Contrary to popular belief, I am
not an alcoholic, but the following
piece probably won't dissuade you
from thinking that I am. Merry Christ-
mas and Happy New Year, and may
Santa visit you as well...

’Twas the night ‘fore exams
And all through the school

Not a student was studying,
As a general rule.

Our stockings were hung
By the coldbox with care,
In the hopes that beer bottles
Soon would chill there.

John Wilson was settled
All snug in his bed,

And visions of arts centers
Danced through his head.

(My roommate was snoring
And having a dream;

For him, Santa poured
Some vodka, it seemed.)

While all alone (sob)

I could not wait ‘till later;
I had just settled down

To write my term paper.

When out on Main Street
There arose such a clutter
I sprang from my desk
To pull tight the shutter.

 
   

Columnist objects

A full moon did shine
On the new-fallen snow,
Brightening the drab scene
With an ethereal glow. By the damn reindeer
When what did I see fly,
Like a bat out of hell,
But a miniature sleigh

I'd be glad to provide it
Pulled by eight tiny elves.

For a reasonable fee.’

And over the groans
Of the elves did I hear,
A deep gravelly voice
That was no reindeer.

He shook his head sadly,

‘On you dumb little sprites,
Or I'll fix you quick,”’
Yelled a voice that could only

Belong to St. Nick.

I sighed to lament this,

Like a cool mountain

To the end of the street
And not a bit more,

Cried the elves with one voice,
‘‘Our damn feet are sore.’’

I asked him to spare me

He said, ‘‘Excuse me,

Then I noticed with horror

That they sped toward my home,
Eight maniacal elves

And me, home alone.

So I told him my story,

The roof they did hit
With a shattering smash,

And all tumbled in quickly
Through the hole with a crash.

We're heavily in debt,
California’s on fire,

I won’t bore you with details
On how St. Nick looked;
You know well enough
If you read a Christmas book.

He gave me a lollipop,
Said, ‘‘Here you go!

Not a word did he say
But went straight to his task,
Grabbed a beer from the fridge
And chugged in a flash.

I yelled, ‘Stupid elf!
You fat, greasy slob!

I don’t want your gifts,
I just need a JOB!”’

LETTERS

NBC if he was to say on the air that Mike Dit-
ka’s errors in coaching the Chicago Bears led

 

I whispered, ‘‘What happened
To Donner and Vixen?’’
The elves muttered, ‘‘Strike

St. Nick winked and said,
‘‘Any item you need?

I said, ‘‘Nice five-four blonde,
Are there any around?’’

Said there’s none to be found.

Then pulled out some Beam;
Said, ‘‘Here, this goes down

The commercial palaver
But just what is the matter?’’
Said I was tired of the world;

How we've just had a war
And th’economy’s absurd.

And I’ll probably go bankrupt
‘Fore my parents retire.

This’ll help bring you out
From your miserable low.’’

   

Then I trembled and shook

At the deed I had done;
I had just screamed at Santa Claus,
union.”’ Our patron of fun! ‘
But Santa just chuckled

And said, ‘‘Is that it?
I think I’ll find something
: That you will find fit.’’

And out of his bag
He slowly withdrew
A small wrapped-up package
That read, ‘‘From Santa to you.”’

And when I had opened it
I shouted for joy;
In my hands lay a JOB,
stream.’’ Better than any toy.
I turned ‘round to thank him
For the heavenly gift,
But as I said thank you,
His spectacles slipped. ,

He looked not a whit
Like Santa Claus then:
To my utter astonishment,
It was SAINT BOB, our friend!

With a pull on his ear
And a sneeze through the nose,

He just disappeared; '
Through the roof-hole he rose.

The elves all did cheer
Upon leaving my room;

Yet Saint Bob said nothing,
Just flew up to the moon.

But I did hear him say,
‘Fore he passed out of sight:
God rest ye southern gentlemen
Y’all drink well and sleep tight!

Atkins recognizes

 

to Neurock firing

To the Editor:

Forget the fact that I am a humor columnist
whose every word leaves you quivering with
glee. I’m pissed off today.

Three weeks ago, WREL-FM radio in Lexing-
ton fired disc jockey Mitch Neurock. They fired
him for doing his job. While commenting upon
a Lexington High School football game against
Buena Vista, which the Lex High team severely
lost, Neurock said that he believed bad coaching
calls led to the defeat.

After the game, Coach Nola of the Scarlet
Hurricanes heard about Neurock’s commentary.
He subsequently called WREL and complained
about Neurock’s opinion. Consequently, WREL
fired Neurock.

Does this seem strange to any of you? That
a ‘‘sports commentator’’ (and the only thing
close to a professional disc jockey that WREL
had), commenting on a game’s coaching dec-
isions, got canned because the coach whined to
the radio station? I don’t know who to be more
mad at, the station or the coach.

Let me insert that Mitch Neurock is a friend
of mine, but he is also a third-year law student
at Washington and Lee. In other words, he’s a
member of our student body.

I’m not advocating anything as drastic as
marching on WREL or fire-bombing the owner’s
home. But the fact that someone got fired be-
cause of the fragile ego of a high school football
coach leaves me appalled. ‘‘Neurock at Night’’
may not have been the best radio show ever
produced, but it was the only one I listened to in
Lexington. Would Dan Dierdorf be fired from

them to lose a game? The whole affair is absurd.

I have not spoken to WREL or Coach Nola
because I’m in the middle of exams. But I would
definitely like to, and I plan to find out more.
Somebody ought to call or write the station and
tell them to get their best DJ back, or they'll be
awfully lonely broadcasting to radios switched to
‘off.’

Sincerely,
Chris Swann, ’92

Dean’s office
to conduct poll

To the Washington and Lee Student Body:

After hearing students talk about The Bat
Cave, Aqua Velva, Petticoat Junction, Disney-
land, etc., I have decided to write an article on
“The Top Ten Off-Campus Houses of Washing-
ton and Lee Students.”’

If you live in an off-campus house and would
like your house to be considered for my top ten
list, either stop by my office (in Payne Hall) and
give me some historical background or write me
a brief history of your house. I am especially
interested in how specific house names were
created and any interesting (and printable) anec-
dotal incidents that give character to your house.

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

some time again for a project. In the meantime,
please convey my gratitude to Josh, Will, Dana,

Peer counselors listen more than tr

 

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

Peer counselors are not ‘‘mini-
Ppsychiatrists,’’ but University Psych-
Ologist James W. Worth says that’s a
common misconception students have
about the group.

“They are not advice-givers, they
are not ‘Dear Abby.’ They are not
there to rescue people,’’ Worth said.
“They are only there to listen and
help people learn what is best for
themselves,"’

Worth said he began the peer

New group
will revive
old forum

By Nicole Keeler
Staff Reporter

 

 

A group of Washington and Lee
women are trying to revive the old
Women’s Forum, which was replaced
by Trident a couple years ago.

Sophomore Kate Stimeling is part
of a 13-woman ‘‘core group’’ she
said believes Trident lost its influence
when sororities came to W&L. The
new group wants to provide a place
for women to meet regardless of their
sorority affiliations, she said.

The group, which held its first
meeting on Nov. 21, is currently
writing a charter and making plans
for future activities.

Erika Lee, a member of the gro-
up, said Women’s Forum plans to
bring well-known female speakers
like U.S. Rep. Pat Schroeder and
television correspondent Diane Saw-
yer to W&L, as well as foster discus-
sion groups on topics like bulimia
and anorexia, date rape and nutrition.

Stimeling said the group also
wants to include W&L men in its
membership. She said the group will
try to increase men’s understanding
of women.

‘‘Men are the antithesis of
women,’’ Stimeling said. ‘‘They’ll
give [us] an opposing opinion.’’

SAB to feature
MTV comedian

By Missy Curtis
Staff Reporter

 

The Student Activities Board is
bringing actor and MTV comedian
Dan Wilson to the General Head-
quarters 8 p.m. tonight.

Wilson, who has performed on
MTV’s ‘‘1/2 Hour Comedy Hour,’’
in the movie Dog Fight with Keanu
Reeves and at more than 100 col-
leges, headlines Christmas activities
this week, said John Flippen, SAB
special events coordinator. Kevin
Jones, another comedian, will open
for Wilson.

The SAB will sponsor more com-
edians Wednesday nights in the GHQ
and bring a ‘‘really big comedian’ to
WA&L in the spring, Flippen said.

after seeing it work at other colleges.
He said the basic premise is that
‘sometimes students are not ready to
talk to a professional counselor be-
cause they don’t want to or because
it’s not that big of a deal.’’

He said the peer counselors are
mainly trained in listening skills
because ‘‘being listened to by some-
body can be a very nurturing ex-
perience.”’

Additionally, peer counselors are
taught problem-solving _ skills
‘because 90 percent of students have
the tools at their disposal to solve

their own problems,’’ Worth said.

Worth said that the majority of
problems counselors deal with are
“the common daily hassles of college
life that get you down,’’ such as time
management, or problems with room-
mates, friends or romances.

But Worth stressed that peer
counselors are trained to know their
limits and what types of situations
they can handle.

“Students who come to a coun-
selor with bigger problems such as
eating disorders, depression, sexual
assault or a desire to commit suicide
are to be referred to myself or Dean

[Anne] Schroer-Lamont, [associate
dean of students and counselling
psychologist],’’ Worth said.

“‘We are not trying to tum stu-
dents into mini-psychiatrists,"’ Worth
said. ‘‘That would be impossible and
irresponsible to try.’

Counselors said they mostly hear
from people they already know, rather
than people who call anonymously.

“Several times I’ve had people
come up to me and start talking to
me, and gradually I'll realize that
they’re talking to me as a peer coun-
selor and not just as a friend,’’ peer
counselor Mary Goetz said.

group of students who desire to par-
ticipate in the fraternity system,’’
Cole said.

Sigma Nu President Heath Dixon,
who voted for Alpha, said he opposes
historically single-race fraternities in
principle, but believes the current
W&L fraternity system does not meet
black students’ needs,

Phi Kapp President Marc Short
said Nov. 19 that one argument agai-
nst Alpha was that it might segregate
the campus. But he said any chapter
voting against Alpha would have to
commit to improving black students’
social lives if Alpha did not pass.

The IFC vote on Alpha was post-
poned from the regular Nov. 19 IFC
meeting to Nov. 21 by Hicks. He
wanted to give fraternities that did
not attend the Nov. 18 information
session more time to talk to the Al-
pha petitioners.

The information session was led
by Penn, seniors Jonathan Harris and
William Toles, and a representative
from Alpha.

In this season of final papers and exams,
what's your favorite way to reduce stress?

At that Nov. 18 information ses-
sion, Executive Committee President
Giles Perkins urged fraternity mem-
bers to vote against Alpha.

‘‘My... reservation about... Alpha
..is that it will promote segregation
on this campus,’’ Perkins. said.

Petitioners for Alpha at the Nov.
18 session objected to Perkins state-
ment, saying that the W&L fratemity
system does not meet their needs.

“Try to relate to what we’re
going through [as black students],’’
Harris, a former Chi Psi member,
said. ‘‘I gave it [the W&L fraternity
system] a shot for two years. It was
not what I want in fraternity.’’

IFC members on Nov. 18 also
asked petitioners why the Alpha
chapter at W&L in the 1970s closed.

Penn said that chapter closed due
to low membership, and Harris said
that will not be a problem with the
new chapter.

“All we're asking for is an
honest shot,’’ Harris said. ‘‘Let’s not
hypocrisize about numbers.’’

Drive promotes
registration

 

By Jennifer Mayo
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington. and Lee College
Republicans will sponsor a voter
registration drive after December
break to encourage students to par-
ticipate in their hometown elections.

Chairman of the College Repub-
licans Amanda Stewart said it is not
easy to get students politically in-
volved at home while they are at
school.

“We really can’t do much to
register students,’’ Stewart said.

But the drive should make it
easier for students to obtain absentee
ballots and participate in their home-
town elections that they might have
otherwise missed, Stewart said.

She said students should register
to vote during December break.

“They have to go to city court-
houses at home to register, but we
can obtain absentee ballots in Lex-
ington for those students who sign up
to receive them.’’

ces will be posted listing applica-
tion procedures and deadlines.

IU

The Independent Union will hold
a brief meeting for ‘‘A Winter

Lounge on Dec. 9 at 8 p.m. Any-
one interested should attend.

Film Society

The next presentation of the
W&L Film Society will be The

Nichetti. Showings will be at
8:05 p.m. on Dec. 6-7 in Lewis
Hall Classroom A. There is no
charge for admission. The film is
in Italian, with English subtitles.
The Icicle Thief starts out as a
parody of the neorealist classic
The Bicycle Thief, but then this
highly inventive film moves on to
satirize the pompous and slick
world of contemporary television
and movies, as commercials
which at first intrude later become
entangled in the plots of feature
films.

Get out your stockings and trim your trees! Christmas
is coming and Lexington is pulling out all the stops. For
the sixth year in a row the Lexington Downtown Dev-
elopment Association is coordinating ‘‘Merry Lexington’’
and ‘‘Holiday In Lexington.’’

One of the big events this weekend is the Community
Christmas parade. There will be floats, and marching
bands, and ribbons in six categories and prize money in
two.

The parade route will travel down Houston Street to
Main Street. It will travel down Main Street until
Washington Street where it will take a right and travel
down to Varner Street. The parade will begin at 11 a.m.

Senior Gabrey Croft is assisting LDDA with the
parade.

Croft, parade chairman for Mock Convention, said she
would be helping LDDA with the marching order and
placement of stakes where there will be a need for people
ready to help in case of problems on Friday night. On
Saturday, she will be at the parade early to help out.

“I’m trying to help the interaction between W&L and
the community,’’ Croft said.

The Christmas spirit is not confined to town. W&L
will be the sight of many holiday activities as well. The
fraternities will be hosting Christmas Weekend parties and
decorating for the holidays, and many students are
decorating their own rooms.

University President John Wilson and his wife Anne
Wilson are also preparing for the holidays. The pres-
idents house will be a feature of the ‘‘Historic Holiday
House Tour’’ on Saturday, and will be decorated for the
event. Mrs. Wilson said the LDDA requested that the
Wilsons allow the Jefferson Florist to decorate the house.

“IT usually do the decorating myself. We like to
decorate with a lot of greenery such as magnolia, and
wreaths along the staircase, which the Jefferson Florist
will be doing,’’ Mrs. Wilson said.

The large Christmas tree outside is a different story.
At press time Mrs. Wilson had not been able to find out
from Buildings and Grounds exactly when the tree would
be decorated and lit.

rated.

Mrs. Wilson said she believed it would be decorated
before the tour.

The Wilsons will be decorating the indoor tree
themselves.

Merry Lexington will begin on Sunday Dec. 8 and
will continue until Jan. 6 Merry Lexington is a com-
bination of open houses for 57 business, holiday concerts,
theater events and much more.

LDDA’s main role is to coordinate the open houses with
the other events and produce a calendar of events for the
month. The calendar may be found at many of the
participating stores.

‘Merry Lexington is a good combination of public
and private coming together,’’ said Herrick.

Most of the open houses will offer refreshments and
a discount of some kind, and many will be ready with
Christmas gift suggestions.

Beth Thompson of The Best Seller said ‘‘it benefits
the community, it’s fun and it makes Lexington look like
a fairy land.”’

Some merchants are working in conjunction with one
another to offer new gift ideas. Paula Cushman of
Postmarks and Pleasures said that they will be working
with Harbs’ to create gift baskets. Spanky’s is also

offering gift baskets.

Cushman said Merry Lexington ‘‘is wonderful. I’m
from a big, big city and there’s nothing like this. It’s a
feeling of unity and it restores your faith.’’

The final event of ‘‘Merry Lexington’’ is Twelfth
Night Bonfire, which will be held at Lime Kiln Theater.

LDDA along with Aldelphia Cable helped to dec-
orating the town. Adelphia has donated their basket truck
to help decorate the taller, private buildings in town. The
Lexington Public Works Department decorated all of the
public building and streets.

Starting this Friday will be ‘‘Holiday In Lexington,”’
a weekend event that begins with an open house at
Cambell House, and end with two performances of The
Nutcracker Ballet.

W&LIFE

in Lexington wy

WSL featured on tour

 

By Cathy Lopiccolo
News Editor

This weekend two Washington and Lee
fraternities are expecting a few guests -- about
1,000, to be exact.

The newly-renovated Beta Theta Pi and Pi
Kappa Alpha houses will be open to the public
Saturday afternoon as part of Lexington’s
Historic Holiday House Tour. The tour, spon-
sored by the Lexington Downtown Development
Association, features eight homes in the city
and on the W&L and Virginia Military Institute
campuses.

The tour, which will run from noon to 5
p.m. Saturday, is being presented as part of the
annual ‘‘Holiday in Lexington’’ weekend.

The LDDA included the fraternity houses on
the tour because of the public interest in the
recent renovations, LDDA Executive Director
Diane Herrick said.

“The public likes to see the changes that
have been made, especially with them being
decorated for Christmas,’’ Herrick said.

Beta Housemother Marnie Stewart said she
volunteered the Beta house for the tour at a
meeting of fraternity housemothers.

‘Our home is so nice and new, so I thoug-
ht we’d show people the big change,’’ Stewart
said. ‘‘I think all the people will be pleased.”’

The Beta house will be decorated outside
and on the first floor, including the house-
mother’s quarters. Stewart said Town and
Country Garden Club members will be trimm-
ing the house and will act as hostesses for the
afternoon.

“(The garden club members] thought deco-
rating a fraternity house would be a great
challenge,’’ Stewart said. ‘‘All the ladies have
been by to see the house and plan the decora-
tions.”’

Stewart said several fraternity members will

also be on hand to answer questions about the
house.

The PiKA house will be decorated simply,
but elegantly, Housemother Ann Davis said.

“*The feeling of the house was that less
was more,”’ Davis said. ‘‘The gentlemen didn’t
want the decorations to be fussy.”’

Davis said PiKA will be decorated with
greenery and garnet bows to complement the
house’s simple Shaker furniture.

The university provided both Beta and
PiKA with Christmas trees grown on the W&L
property at Skylark, Davis said.

In addition to the fraternity houses, homes
on the tour include the residence of Mayor H.E.
‘*Buddy”’ Derrick, Stonegate, the Pendleton-
Coles House, the VMI Superintendent’s Quart-
ers and George C. Marshall Library, and the
Lee House.

The first level of Lee House will be shown
on the tour, and will feature Lee family heir-
looms. Visitors will see an 18th century grand-
father clock in the central hall, and will visit
the drawing room, the dining room, the library,
which was originally Mrs. Lee’s bedroom, and
the music room which served as the Lee family
sitting room. Featured in the music room will
be the Lee piano, and photographs of the house
during the Lee years.

Twelve members of Chi Omega sorority
have also volunteered to sell tickets and con-
duct house tours on Saturday, Chi-O Service
Chairman Amy Beall said.

‘*All we have to do is go to certain loca-
tions and help guide tours through the houses,”’
Beall said.‘‘The LDDA really wants to make
the tours nice this year, and they appreciated
the help.”’

Tickets for the tours are $6 for adults and
will be available Saturday at tour locations and
at the tourist center on Washington Street.
Tickets can also be purchased in advance from
the Jefferson or University florists.

Generals top Sewanee to open year, fall to ranked teams

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

Despite losing three of its first
four games, the Washington and Lee
basketball has not pressed the panic
button as it heads towards exams.

‘“*We’ve got ten new players,’’
said head coach Verne Canfield. ‘‘We
have played a very difficult schedule
so far, and we’re struggling to get
everyone acquainted with themselves
and our system. But we’ll come
around.”’

The Generals won their first game
of the year, but since have dropped
three games in a row to teams ranked
nationally. Seventh-ranked Wooster,
11th-ranked Hampden-Sydney and the
preseason pick to finish fourth in the
South region Bridgewater represent
W&L’s three losses.

The Generals opened the season

with a 67-58 win over Sewanee in
the first round of the W&L Tip-off
Tournament. Sophomores Paul Baker
and Robert Miggins led a second-
half charge that erased a 19-6 first
half deficit.

Baker scored seven of the
Generals’ first 12 second half points,
and Miggins scored seven points in
the second half, including the basket
that gave W&L the lead for good.
Once W&L got the lead, Sewanee
never got closer than six.

Junior Bryan Watkins scored a
career-high 17 points to lead the way,
and Baker added a career-high 11.
Junior Bryan Brading was also in
double figures with 10 points, and
Miggins added nine points and nine
rebounds in the win.

Wooster dominated the champion-
ship game, using a balanced inside
attack. The Scots opened up a 34-12
first half lead behind tournament

MVP Stan Aukamp’s 11 first half
points: The Generals made a late run.
Miggins scored seven points late in
the half to cut the Wooster lead to
36-21 at the half.

Wooster pulled away in the sec-
ond half. The Scots 55-31 when
W&L made a run to make the score
respectable. Sophomore Matt Newton
scored seven straight points and
freshman John Rogers added four and
the Generals cut the lead to 63-47
before falling 76-53.

Miggins led W&L with 13 points
and a game-high nine rebounds and
was named to the all-tournament
team.

‘Robert has some nice tools that
will be useful,’’ said Canfield. ‘‘He
does some good things at both ends
of the floor.”’

After falling to Hampden-Sydney
84-55, the Generals looked to even
their record at 2-2 against Bridge-

water last Sunday.

Rogers scored 12 points in the
first half, and the Generals opened up
a 35-31 halftime lead despite playing
without starting point guard Brading.
Newton filled in with five first half
points.

The Generals went cold in the
second half, shooting a miserable 28
percent, and Bridgewater used a dunk
and blocked shot from Ashley Wat-
son to overtake the Generals and pull
away for a 74-61 win. Watson hit all
seven of his shots, and the Eagles
shot 59 percent for the game and 63
percent in the second half.

Watkins led the way for the Gen-
erals with 16 points. Rogers did not
score in the second half and finished
with a career-high 12.

“IT was disappointed with the
Bridgewater game,’’ Canfield said. ‘‘I
thought we should have won, but we
didn’t run our offenses and didn’t

execute on defense.”’

Despite the disappointing loss,
Canfield is pleased with his young
team’s early effort.

‘‘We’re playing hard,’’ he said.
‘I’m pleased with our attitude. We're
correcting our mistakes and making
progress every day.’’

The Generals will look to move
the progress from the practices into
the games this weekend. The Gene-
rals play Pomona-Pitzer in the first
round of the Washington University

Hannah saves best
race for last meet

 

By Jacob Kimball
Staff Reporter

 

After running a strong race in the
regional meet, Bo Hannah and Char-
les Edwars returned to Newport
News, Va. to run in the NCAA Di-
vision III Championship Meet on
Saturday, Nov. 23.

Just the week before, they had
recorded their respective fastest times
of the season, and they returned to
try to better their times, and to run in
the most competitive race of their
lives.

Hannah and Edwards found them-
selves among the mass of 177 run-
ners that earned a birth by either
being a member of one of the top 21
teams in the nation, or by finishing
in the top five of one of the eight
regions across the United States.

Hannah, a junior, ran with the
lead pack for,the first three miles and
finished the race 40th overall. He
bested his fastest time ever by 30
seconds as he finished in 25:22. With
that finale, Hannah had recorded a
personal record time in each of the
last three races of the year, each the
biggest of the year at the time: the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference,
regional, and national championships.

“Bo ran as well as I thought he
could in Regionals,’ said coach John
Tucker. ‘‘Then he took thirty seconds
off that time. It was incredible. He
ran a stronger middle and also looked
stronger coming across the finish
line.’’

Charles Edwards, a senior, also
finished very strong in the last race
of his collegiate career. Edwards’
finish brought him in 107th in a time
of 26:25. Edwards finished his stel-
lar career and season strongly. He
recorded the same personal record
time in his last two races.

The winning time was 24:26, and
the top 15 runners were all under 25

Editors and a Business Manager are wanted for the new
monthly news magazine sponsored by the Publications
Board. Applications for these jobs should consist of a letter of
interest, including qualifications. Applications are due to Rick
Peltz at P.O. Box 40 on Dec. 20. Applicants will be contacted
to set up interviews, which will be held on Monday, Jan. 13,

beginning at 8 p.m.

This will be the mission of the new magazine:

 

BASKETBALL, INDOOR TRACK, SWIMMING, WRESTLING

minutes. The 25 finishers receive all-
American designation, and Hannah
was only 15 seconds off that pace.

However, this was an exceptional-
ly competitive race according to
Tucker.

‘‘Bo’s time would have won
Regionals last week, and would have
brought him in the top 25 at Nation-
als last year.”’

Hannah’s performance was _ the
second best in W&L history. Only
Angus Mcbride and his 10th-place
finish at the 1984 National Cham-

pionships.
Edwards and Hannah turned in
remarkable individual accomplish-

ments throughout the year, but Tuck-
er was also pleased with the overall
team effort this season.

‘In all of the years I have
coached, this was the best team as
far as improvement and performance
level when you look at where we
began and where we finished.’’

The Generals finished 8-1 and
were the only team to defeat #1
ranked Lynchburg in a scored meet.
Tucker noted that the team really
came together at the end of the sea-
son. Eight out of the twelve team
members ran personal records in the
last or next to last race of the season.

The team is poised to have a-
nother strong season next year.

“We will lose both Charles and
Lee [Parker] out of our top five, but
I look to freshmen Matthew Brock
and Doug Boyles along with junior
Jim Gilreath to be strong contributors
and help fill the void,’’ said Tuck-
ee”

And don’t forget Hannah. He led
W&L in every race this season, and
will return next year to try and top
this year’s effort.

‘Coupled with Lynchburg losing
their top two runners, the prospects
for winning ODAC’s may be brighter
than ever.’’

Two weekends ago, the Wash-
ington & Lee men’s swimming team
opened its season with three suc-
cessive meets, two against Allegheny
and one against Centre in the W&L
Dual Meet Invitational.

The outcomes of those meets sent
out mixed signals as to the type of
season the Generals were going to
have. The team opened on Friday
against powerhouse Allegheny, losing
119-67. W&L returned on Saturday
to trounce Centre 134-42. The Gen-
erals then met Allegheny again on
Sunday losing again, but by a more
respectable score of 123-79.

Despite the roller coaster scores,
coach Page Remillard was upbeat
about his team’s performance.

“I was pleased with how we per-
formed. We swam well, and if this is
a starting point, it’s a great one.’’

The Washington and Lee women’s
swimming team had a promising
showing at their first official meet of
the 1991-92 season back on Nov. 23
and 24.

The Generals hosted the first
annual Dual Meet Challenge against
Allegheny and Ithaca, both of whom
are nationally ranked, and Centre,
who offered an evenly matched team
both in skill and numbers.

The Generals beat Centre 95-87
behind junior Claire Dudley. Dudley
won the 100-yard freestyle and the
200-yard breaststroke.

First year coach Kiki Jacobs was

Former cadet to

of the Phi Staff
The for-
mer VMI cadet W&L
charged with | freshman
the October | testifies
rape of a W&L_ | Hudnall raped

freshman will
face a Rock-
bridge County grand jury Feb. 3.

Chad Hudnall, 18, faces charges
of forcible sodomy, rape, breaking
and entering and grand larceny.

In a preliminary hearing Dec.
17, Judge Joseph E. Hess heard
testimony from an 18-year-old W&L
woman who said Hudnall raped her
and forced her to perform oral sex in
her room in Gilliam Dormitory.

The woman said she awoke at
about 4 a.m. on Oct. 13 and found
Hudnall naked and on top of her.

The woman testified that she
asked Hudnall to stop. She said when
he later released her and began
looking for his clothes, she demanded
to know his name. According to the
woman, Hudnall replied, ‘“That’s not
important.”’

The woman said she threw on a
sweatshirt, ran into the hallway and
screamed for help. Three male
students detained Hudnall in another
room until W&L security arrived.

The woman, who testified she
had been drinking earlier that
evening, said her bedroom door was
unlocked.

The woman said she did not
know Hudnall, but had seen him
visiting Christine Harvey, a dorm
counselor in Gilliam.

Hudnall, who did not testify

her

that he stole more than $300 from
Harvey’s room the same evening.

Harvey testified at the
preliminary hearing that she met
Hudnall at a W&L fraternity party
and he had visited her several times
in her room.

Harvey, who was not in her
room at the time of the alleged rape,
said she returned to her room later
that evening and discovered the
money was missing. Harvey said she
had left her door unlocked.

Harvey testified that someone
had also drawn on her mirror in
lipstick and burned part of a
photograph in her room.
r Lab tests
later identified

the scorched
photograph as
belonging to
Hudnall.
Police
officer Gary
i: Coleman
Pestitied
Hudnall Hudnall told
him he had been drinking the night of
the alleged rape and wanted to see
Harvey. Coleman said Hudnall later
asked if Harvey would drop the
charges if he got her money back.
Coleman said a_ search of
Hudnall’s room at VMI did not tun
up the money. He testified that the
$354 was turned over to police a few
days later after another cadet found
the money in one of Hudnall’s boots.
Hudnall, a resident of Newport
News, Va., withdrew from VMI
within days after the charges were
filed.
He is currently being held in the
Rockbridge County Regional Jail.

set of women’s formal Rush parties begin tomorrow night, with
over 160 rushees expected to attend.

Competitive Rush predicted this year

 

By JENNIFER MAYO
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Panhellenic Council members
say this year’s sorority Rush may be
the most competetive one yet for the
approximately 160 rushees who will
participate.

Washington and Lee’sororities
will kick off their fourth Rush Friday
night with Open House parties.
Rushees will meet members of the
three existing sororities — Kappa
Kappa Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta
and Chi Omega — and Pi Beta Phi,

which hopes to form a chapter on
campus this winter.

“‘Because so many girls are
going through, it will give sororities
themselves more choice because we
will be releasing girls earlier. If
they’re really interested in one they’ll
have to work to let its members
know,’’ said Panhellenic Delegate
Amanda Stewart.

This year’s Rush will differ
from those in the past because of a
new arrangement designed to guaran-
tee Pi Phi a large number of pledg-
es.

According to an agreement
between Pi Phi nationals and the
W&L sororities, almost half of the
women who complete Rush will
receive bids from Pi Phi. The
remaining rushees will be divided
among the three other sororities.

Sororities must release a large
number of women after the second
set of parties and will invite fewer
rushees back for their third and fourth
sets of parties this year.

Rushees must also drop one
sorority from their rush dates. After
the last parties on Wednesday night

rushees will rank their three favorite
sororities on preference cards.

The sororities will issue bids
Thursday afternoon.

Outside of the formal Rush
parties, no-contact rules for sorority
members and rushees remain in effect
until next Thursday.

‘“‘So far, there have been no
rush violations, but we have a week
to go,’’ said Panhellenic President
Dale Wyatt. ‘‘I hope every one can
keep a clean slate.”’

Washington and Lee is considering moving

| fraternity Rush from fall to winter term, but the
} move would leave male freshmen with nothing
| to do during their first semester at college,

university administration said.

“‘Right now, [winter rush] is not possible
because there is no tangible example of a [so-
cial] alternative,’’ said Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy”’
Atkins, associate dean of students for Greek af-
fairs. ‘“There have to be some other things for
freshmen to do.”’

Dean of Students David Howison said the
Student Affairs Committee, which has discussed
the move for about a month, is following a
recommendation in ‘‘The Washington and Lee
Institutional Long Range Plan 1990-2000,”
which was written by students, faculty and
administrators in 1989 following an extensive
study of the university.

“Beginning in January 1993, provided the
university introduces other changes, we recom-
mend that fraternities institute a winter rush,”’
the plan states.

Howison said the issue needs to be dis-
cussed.

 

'SAC urges discussion
of holding winter Rush

“I feel it is appropriate for SAC to consid-
er this issue because of the charge of the Long
Range Plan,’’ Howison said.

But Atkins said W&L has not made the
plan’s ‘‘other changes’’ upon which a move to
winter rush is conditioned.

“‘T agree with winter rush, but first we
need to meet certain conditions,’’ Atkins said.

Specifically, he said W&L has not met the
plan’s recommendation for a new and expanded
student center. Without one, Atkins said, either
male freshmen will have no social outlets, or
fraternities will be forced to unofficially rush
freshmen throughout the 12-week fall term,
placing an unreasonable financial burden on
them.

The plan also classifies construction of a
new Student center as ‘‘critically important.”’

Darren Braccia, president of Pi Kappa
Alpha agreed with Atkins.

**Winter rush would be really tough on
us,’’ Braccia said. ‘‘Everybody hates it [Rush]
now. Imagine if it lasted 12 weeks.’’

Professor Lewis John, who was dean of
students in 1989 and headed the committee that
reported on freshman life, agreed that a winter
rush would require the university to provide
more social opportunities for freshmen.

The Delt bar

Delt renovations on hold, SAC to punish chapter

 

 

 

 

Photo by Leigh Allen, The Ring-tun Phi
Vandalism left a hole in a wall at the end of a bedroom hallway
upstairs in Delt.

The Delta Tau Delta House Corporation tempo-
rarily suspended the fraternity’s participation in the
Fraternity Renaissance Program after vandalism to
the house, and the chapter faces at least critical
probation from the university.

According to Dean of Students David L. Howi-
son, the Interfraternity Council, Student Affairs
Committee and Student Conduct Committee are
looking into charges that Delt members broke win-
dows, destroyed walls, dismantled a brick bar and
removed ceiling tiles in the chapter house.

“The house was reduced to general mayhem,
but there was no serious damage,’’ Delt junior
Patrick McCabe said.

The Delt House Corporation had agreed to
transfer the title to the house and property at 106
Lee Avenue under the Rennaissance program.

Delt House Corporation President Taylor Cole
said he discovered damage to the house on Dec.
22. He then reported the damage in letters sent to
Howison and Associate Dean of Students for Greek
Affairs Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins.

In the letter, Cole said he was suspending the

transfer of the title until the situation is resolved.

Howison said, ‘‘I’m waiting on the official
report from the Delt president. Things are on hold
until then,’’

W&L Director of Capital Planning Frank
Parsons said he expects the delay in Delt’s Renais-
sance participation to be temporary.

‘*We’re ready to go ahead with bids to contrac-
tors once this situation is resolved,’’ Parsons said.

According to Atkins, Delt has been referred to
the Student Affairs Committee. SAC can vote to
terminate or suspend Delt, or put the chapter on
“‘critical probation,’’ he said.

Delt appeared for an IFC judicial meeting Tues-
day night. IFC referred the matter to SAC, recom-
mending critical probation.

IFC President Greg Hicks refused to comment
on the results of Tuesday’s meeting saying only,
“‘The IFC is handling the situation.’’

Delt President Chris Barker also refused to
comment Tuesday night.

Despite the investigation, Cole displayed
confidence in Delt’s future at W&L.

“In the past this has been one of the best
houses on campus,’’ Cole said. ‘‘The house will
have huge potential after Renaissance.”’

No justice in
judicial hearings

Just last month our nation celebrated the 200th
anniversary of the adoption of the Bill of Rights. These first
10 amendments to the Constitution guarantee the basic
liberties of speech, press and assembly, and they establish
rules of faimess in judicial proceedings. Over the years these
laws have been clarified and expounded by the United States
Supreme Court. The trend has been toward open
government, especially in matters that concern us all.

It is ironic that as we celebrated the Bill of Rights, two
major organs of justice at Washington and Lee were hiding
behind closed doors: the Interfraternity Council and the
Student Conduct Committee.

The bylaws of IFC give the body broad powers to close
its meetings. IFC’s Executive Committee can arbitrarily
decide what parts of the meeting shall be closed, and all
hearings before IFC Judicial Board are closed.

Decisions made by the Judicial Board affect the future
of W&L’s fraternity system. Such decisions are important
not only to the members of houses involved, but, in the long
run, to all men affiliated with the fraternity system (about 80
percent of W&L men). Moreover, there is no way to ensure
equitable punishments without the check of a free press. The
system can only benefit from opening these judicial hearings.

The judicial functions of SCC are even more deeply
shrouded behind a veil of secrecy. Students called before
SCC are students accused of disturbing our community’s
peaceful existence, possibly abusive behavior and certainly
behavior that warrants community attention. With all
hearings on the matter shielded from view, the community
can not give such hearings the attention they deserve.

But more importantly, the closed hearings afford SCC
the ability to abuse the power they have been granted by the
student body. While the judicial functions of the Executive
Committee deal with a single sanction, SCC may impose a
variety of sanctions that might or might not fit the crime.

Further, while those accused by the EC have the
undeniable right to an open trial, those accused before SCC
may appeal only to a closed session of the Student Affairs
Committee, a body dominated by faculty and administrative
interests. Nowhere, at no time will an SCC defendant be

given the right to plead his case to the public.

Clearly, SCC and IFC have to weigh the benefits to the
accused by maintaining secrecy against the benefits to both
the accused and the community through an open judicial
process. We maintain that the benefits to the accused are
marginal while benefits to the community, paired with
additional benefits to the accused, are great. At the very
least, an open judicial process should be an option for the
accused.

Secrecy is outdated. The accused, both individuals and
fraternities, wishing to hide behind the secrecy clauses will
be less inclined to break the rules if they know they will
face the public.

This week we were informed that SCC was punishing a
member of our community. Was the individual given a fair
hearing? Was the punishment reasonable relative to the
offense? We may never know the truth in that case or any
other.

The tale of the
lonely beer bottle

 

My VIEW

By Frederick Ryan

 

 

 

 

 

Be aware that

 

Once upon a time — along a windswept bay, a long- _
necked brown bottle blew buoyantly ashore. When the
waters receded, it was plain to see that this was no ordinary .
bottle. Inscribed upon the glass was this special message:

Caution: ‘‘The contents herein contain Alcohol, a
mood-altering drug. Consumption of small amounts has _
Proven to be a reliable source of good cheer; larger
amounts, conversely, have proven quite hazardous, and

. have resulted in loss of sobriety, consciousness, health and
life. Be aware that Alcohol is an addictive drug; excessive ’
consumption and its associated hazards can remain unchal-
lenged for a lifetime. Be especially aware that deception
remains a subtle but powerful characteristic of this drug; its - *
abuse has caused many to erroneously believe that the
associated destructive effects can be avoided by adopting

a personal attitude of apathy,
defiance or denial.”’
Brewer’s Recommen-

dation: ‘‘It is the sincere
alcohol is an hope of this brewery staff ¢
addictive drug... that the uncapping of our
Be especially bottle will add a cheerful

tragic one. If one of our

bottle capped, it was intend-
powertul ed for someone else. We
characteristic thank you for your coopera-
of this drug. tion.””

An old man slowly
lowered the bottle. With a

renewed sense of hope, he believed that somewhere,
perhaps ages ago, people young and old cared; cared
enough to read each bottle faithfully, and always drink in
moderation. The bottle slipped carefully into his coat
pocket as he started for home. While he walked, he
wondered. When? When would the generations of his
society be so blessed to understand that Alcohol is a drug
and fully realize that it is destructive?

Swann’s predictions for the new year

 

LET IT RIDE

By Chris Swann

 

I’m sure we all want to start off 1992 with a
big Happy New Year to the Athletic Department
for holding gym sign-up Monday moming at 8
a.m... NOT. I mean, do these guys want to make
it difficult for me to graduate, or what?

1991 was a fairly interesting year, all things
considered. Communism fell, unemployment rose;
the Braves almost won the World Series, a bona:
fide sign that God does exist; and, of course, we
can’t forget the little target practice session George
Bush held in the Middle East. I sometimes think
CNN staged the Gulf War so they could get all
those Nielsen rating points. The new year promises
to be just as interesting. I see it going something
like this:

January — January 21 will become National
Activists Day to celebrate all the wonderful rebels
out there. The date is chosen to coincide with
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day on the 20th (my
birthday, for all loyal fans who wish to send gifts)
so government workers get a four-day weekend.
(Not to ridicule one of the greatest peace activists
ever, but we need another national holiday like we
need more music from Skid Row and Cinderella.)

February — Yitzak Shamir, facing wavering
support in Israel, finishes the job and nukes Sad-
dam Hussein’s bunker in Iraq, thereby placing a
five-thousand-year moratorium on the world’s oil
supplies. Shamir becomes the Israeli answer to
George Washington... Medical experts discover
that red M&Ms really do give you cancer.

Hill out on St. Patrick’s Day... A California envi-
ronmental group creates a totally efficient solar

AIDS coverage

To the Editor:

shows media flaw

 

The now fading memory of our nation’s
outburst of concem with the AIDS virus in
response to Magic Johnson’s contraction of the
disease exposed the deplorable state of media
coverage in this nation and the perverted per-
spective it provides our society.

For years since the initial outbreak of AIDS,
with its attendant homophobic paranoia and
scorn for the sick, people have been dying.
And as they have been dying, the issue has
slipped to the back page or even disappeared
altogether. Like every other important issue, the
press forgot about AIDS until something sensa-
tional happened — something people would care
about. Somewhere along the line, the press ran
out of concern. But the people were still dying.

What does it say about our society when
one famous athlete’s contraction of AIDS
focuses more attention on the issue than the
miserable deaths of innocent thousands?

Maybe the best thing for our response to
AIDS in this country would be the contraction
of the disease by more of the only kind of
people that seem to provoke widespread inter-
est in the issue — celebrities. It made me
tremble to watch the swell of attention lavish-
ed upon AIDS in response to one man’s con-
traction of the disease. Where was the media
when the others were dying? Where were the
calls for more research when the people who
were not famous were suffering? Now Magic

energy plant, thus off-setting the loss of all that
nuclear-poisoned oil. Another California group
protests that the sun’s rights are being violated,
beginning a 19-month lawsuit.

April — The Democrats decide to nominate
Franklin D. Roosevelt as their presidential candi-
date. Bush’s popularity plunges even further... For
April Fool’s, Iraq invades Yugoslavia and declares
a cease-fire. Serbs and Croatians unite peacefully
for the first time in living memory to eradicate the

fools. ‘

 

A cure for AIDS? President
Quayle? a, Burgers? National
Activists Day? Canadian
annexation? What else will the
future bring?

 

May — Salman Rushdie, the famous author-in-
hiding of The Satanic Verses, is discovered to be
Jimmy Hoffa. Puzzled Moslem fanatics withdraw
their assassination requests as the Teamsters enter
their own... Germany retakes the former German
part of Poland and annexes the Baltic states just
for the hell of it.

June — The Commonwealth of Independent
States, formally the Soviet Union, attacks Japan as
a goodwill gesture toward the United States...
Doctors discover a cure for AIDS in an effort to
save Magic Johnson.

July — Just to join the warfare trend in the
world, and to give the military a reason to exist,
the United States annexes Canada. Mexican offi-
cials protest to the United Nations, citing that
America should have annexed them... Bush cuts
the income taxes, thus raising his popularity

Student arrests
drop last term

To the Editor:

Last year, in an effort to increase awareness
of student disciplinary issues and promote more
responsible behavior in our community, I
compiled the student arrest records in the City
of Lexington beginning fall 1988. One-hundred
Washington and Lee students were arrested
during fall term 1988 for alcohol-related be-
havior that included DUI, possession, drunken-
ness, noise and litter. During fall term 1989, 74
students were arrested.

In fall term 1990, with the cooperation of
the Interfraternity Council, the Lexington City
Police and the Lexington Community Council,
a coordinated effort was made to improve
communication between the University and the
Lexington community. Our goal was to address
issues before they became problems. The
periodic meetings between IFC leaders and
Bruce Beard, Chief of Police, were especially
productive.

Perhaps as a result of these efforts, the
number of Washington and Lee students arrest-
ed during fall term 1990 dropped to 45. For the
just concluded fall term 1991, 35 Washington
and Lee students were arrested for alcohol-

August — Reporters discover that Magic
Johnson never had AIDS, but merely said so in
order for the government to get off its collective
butt and give enough money to medical research-
ers to discover a cure... The NFL announces it is
disbanding due to a lack of coaching personnel.
Dan Dierdorf and John Madden offer their servic-
es, thereby dooming professional football for the
coming decades.

September —-+ Ina desperation move, the
Democratic party nominates Dan Quayle for
president, hoping to place all blame on him.
Quayle accepts the nomination on the grounds that
Pee-Wee Herman be his running mate... Steven
Spielberg films Bad Man in Baghdad, casting Burt
Reynolds as Saddam Hussein and Clint Eastwood
as Norman Schwarzkopf.

October — The Atlanta Braves win the World
Series... In related news, former Minnesota Twins
player Ron Hrbek joins the World Wrestling
Federation.

November — Dan Quayle wins the presiden-
tial election, forcing masses of Americans to flee
north and free Canada. George Bush is elected
Ultimate Monarch of the Northern Republic of
America... Mikhail Gorbachev, final president of
the former Soviet Union, opens a fast-food fran-
chise in Miami. ‘‘Gorby Burgers’? become the
rage, and the profitable restaurants inject masses of
dollars into the economy, thus ending the reces-
sion.

December — George Bush returns to the
United States after Americans depose Quayle and
beg for the former president to return... Millions of
children around the world are completely de-
pressed and disgusted when Santa Claus turns out
to be Rosanne Barr with a beard.

Happy New Year.

related violations of Lexington regulations, a 65
percent decline from fall term 1988. This
positive trend is significant and I would like to
acknowledge the many student leaders who
have worked hard to raise the level of student
behavior in our community. Your efforts are
appreciated.

To the Editor:

Please allow me to share with you a recent
experience. I have had health problems that
required daily trips to Roanoke for seven weeks
of treatment. I was physically unable to drive.
A staff member of the School of Commerce ar-
ranged and faculty, wives and students pro-
vided drivers for us each day.

My heart is too full to express adequately
my appreciation for these generous acts. I want
everyone to know how much my life has been
enriched by these caring friends.

In this time of conflict and uncertainty it is
an enduring comfort to know that, so long as
there are among us people with such love and
compassion, the future of the University and
our community is bright and secure. We are
forever in their debt.

Time out!

IFC, Contact book woh ooey
to speak after H-SC

 

etball game

By JENNIFER LATHAM
and JAMESON LEONARDI
Phi Staff Reporters

Dick Vitale of ESPN and
ABC Sports fame will speak in
Doremus Gymnasium on Jan. 29
after the Hampden-Sydney
basketball game.

Known for his unique
sportscasts and coaching career,
Vitale will address goals and
victories in his presentation.

Vitale has been recognized
for his talks on SportsCenter’s
‘Fast Breaks.’’ He also coached
the Detroit Pistons and recently
chronicled his 1990-91 season
in the book Time Out, Baby!

Vitale’s newspaper columns
and motivational ‘‘Say No To
Drugs’’ speech have also earned
national publicity.

Contact and the
Interfraternity Council are co-
sponsoring Vitale’s appearance.

‘Historically, the IFC has
provided one-third of our
budget,’’ said Contact
spokesman Marc Short. “‘Last
year, the IFC voted to
discontinue this and Contact lost
a big portion of its budget.

‘“‘This year, we asked the
IFC to fund one speaker. They
agreed to Dick Vitale,’’ Short
said.

While the IFC is providing
money for Vitale’s appearance,
IFC President Greg Hicks said,
*‘Contact is taking care of all
the details.’’

IFC is contributing to the
Vitale agreement from a fund
collected from chapters on a
per-head basis. Hicks would not
say how much the IFC
contribution is.

Tim Gallagher, chairman of
Contact, said Vitale’s speech
will be ‘‘great for the basketball
program, because he’s the best
in the business.’’

Shoplifting rise
irks mercnants

 

By ALISHA JOHNSON

 

Phi Staff Reporter

Holiday
wreaths and Some shop-
warning signs keepers
made their | suspect
appearances | students in
together in
many local recent thefts
store windows
last month,

Several local merchants placed
warnings that ‘‘ALL Shoplifters will
be prosecuted’’ on their shop
windows and doors, an action that
some owners had never considered
before.

“*(Shoplifting] has become a
reality and a concern, and it is what
we are addressing now,’’ said Diane
Herrick, executive director of the
Lexington Downtown Development
Association.

Herrick said that she suspects
that W&L students have been
involved in the thefts, but not
exclusively.

Linda Plogger, manager of
TGIF Outlet Stores at 30 S. Main St.,
said she experienced a couple of
instances with W&L students.

‘We have had an instance last
February where a couple of
Washington and Lee girls put on
bathing suits under their clothes and
left,’ Plogger said.

Plogger said the girls had left
the store before she had a chance to
stop them, and she didn’t file a police
report.

‘‘T know who they were, and if
they come back in here, I'll be
watching them,’’ she said.

But Plogger said that her
experience with W&L students has
been almost entirely favorable in the
past.

‘*Most of the [W&L] kids who
come in here are very good,’’ she
said. ‘“There is generally no problem
because they are on the Honor
System.”

W&L Dean of Students David
Howison said the fact that W&L

_ Under _ White’s . leadership,.. the __ library, [j

collection was cataloged, probably for the first. .. }

 

She is indispensible, she has the answers, she
stays up all night long and she is a computer.

The Washington and Lee library’s new
computerized catalog has been named ‘‘Annie’’ in
honor of Annie Jo White, founder of the Fancy
Dress Ball and former university librarian.

The committee chose the name because it is
‘‘short, easy to pronounce and spell, and one that
had a significant Washington and Lee connection,’’
said University Librarian Barbara Brown, who

headed the committee.

‘More importantly, it is appropriate that we
honor a woman who was such a friend to

students,’’ Brown added.

The committee came up with the name, rather
than choosing one from the about 150 entries in a
campus-wide contest it conducted last fall, Brown
said. The committee could not agree on any of the

entries, she said.

White, known as ‘‘Miss Annie Jo” to W&L
students, was appointed university librarian in
1895. She retired in 1928 and died in 1938.

time, Brown said. White also increased library
hours and supervised the move of the collection to
what is today the Commerce School.

White was known by students for raising
money for theater projects and athletic teams. A
crew boat in the 1890s was named Annie Jo.

White founded Fancy Dress as a costume ball
in 1907 with a $42 budget. She attended every FD
except one until she died.

Known for her spirited nature, White had an
encounter with the law during Prohibition when she
purchased bottles of Scotch and rum through the
mail. Then University President Henry L. Smith
intervened to prevent a grand jury indictment.

The 1908 Calyx said of White, ‘‘Admiration
of her is stamped forever on our minds; love for
her is seated deep in our hearts; respect for her is
impressed indelibly on our souls.”’

The library system, which went on line during
Thanksgiving break, cost about $600,000, including
the cost of bar-coding every book, Brown said. The
catalog allows students to search for books by
author, title, subject or keyword.

  

students were suspects in the
increased crime ‘“‘came as 4a
surprise.’’

‘It is an issue students should
be aware of,’ Howison said. ‘‘I
think we should consider the scope of
the problem and how [seldom] it
refers to W&L. But I also want to
remind students to honor the Honor
System. W&L is a partner with the
community.’’

Howison stressecd that the
Honor Code does apply to student
actions in the city of Lexington.

Herrick said the shoplifting
signs, made by the LDDA, were
distributed to approximately 30 local
business representatives who attended
the association’s shoplifting workshop
on Nov. 21.

The Lexington Chamber of
Commerce and the LDDA sponsored
the shoplifting workshop, where the
business representatives watched a
video produced by the Small Business
Advancement Institute.

‘“‘We heard that various
shopkeepers were starting to feel the
effects of shoplifting and we wanted
to find ways to prevent it from
happening,’’ Herrick said.

The video addressed several
issues, including how to prosecute a
shoplifting case and what to do to
make shoplifting more difficult.

‘The business owners] were
very receptive to the information,”
Herrick said. ‘‘Many felt it was very
helpful.

‘‘One of the points we feel is a
deterrent to crime is publicity, talking
to the media. We publicize when
good things are happening. We also
need to let people know when bad
things happen.”’

Herrick said she feels people
do not realize the effect stealing has
on business owners in a closely-knit
community.

‘*Some of the owners do take it
personally,’’ Herrick said. ‘“‘It does
hurt when someone takes something;
not only because the prices must go
up, but also because the owners care
a lot about their stores.”’

  

 

White

Brown said the circulation system will be
automated by March. Students will check books
out with the university card and be able to tell by
computer whether books are checked out.

Brown said the library also plans to add
periodical holdings and books on order to the
catalog in the summer.

W&L AT WAR!

 W&LIFE |

The Ring-tum Phi, January 9, 1992

 

50 years ago this week, students returned after break
to find their school and their lives turned upside down

 

By JASON KELLEY
Phi Editor

 

It is January 1942,

The United States has been at
war with the Empire of Japan and
Hitler’s Third Reich for one month.

The Ring-tum Phi reports, ‘‘after
23 years and eight months of uneasy
peace another generation of
Washington and Lee students — like
those of 1776, 1812, 1840, 1861,
1898, and 1917 — realize the historic
significance’’ of their own era.

As 895 men return to begin the
winter semester, there is a sense that
WA&L has changed and will never be
quite the same again.

Gone are the dances for which
the school was famed. Road trips
have been abolished to save gasoline
and tires. The football team will not
take the field again until the fall of
1946. Students are checking with
their draft boards to see what their
status with the armed forces is.

Today, fifty years later, there
are only a scant few men left in
Lexington who were part of that
group of 895 who returned to find
their world and their school tumed
upside down.

Ewing Humphreys, °44, is one
of them.

Humphreys came to W&L as a

freshman in the fall of 1940,
following in his father and
grandfather’s footsteps.

‘*When Pearl Harbor happened,
it changed all of our lives,’’ he said.
“‘T was riding to see my girlfriend at
Hollins and we stopped to get a Coke
and the news was being broadcast on
the radio. We were stunned.”’

Humphreys said in January of

1942 he went to Portsmouth to join
the Marines. The commanding officer
swore him into the reserves and told
him to go back to school.

‘*He said they’d call me when I
was needed, and he said they might
make me an officer,’’ Humphreys
said.

Humphreys spent about a year
back at W&L before he was called to
active duty.

Enrollment at the school
plummeted from 941 in February of
1941 to only 97 students by the fall
of 1944,

According to a 1943 Phi article,
WA&L lost a larger percentage of its
student body to the armed forced than
any other college in the United States.
In the eight months of the 1942-1943
academic year, fully two-thirds of the
students left to fight.

Humphreys said he was the only
one left to close up the Phi Delta
Theta house in 1943.

‘I was eating at the Beta house
and there were army officers living in
some of the other fraternities,’’ he
said.

 

‘Washington and Lee has
seen the disillusioning,
almost disastrous effects
of World War Il. She
reeled, she staggered,
but she kept on.’

 

Those army officers were on
campus to conduct the Army’s school
for personnel services which was run
at W&L from 1942 through 1946.

To make up some of the lost
tuition revenue, University trustees
rented Tucker Hall, the dining hall,

the student center and use of the gym
and athletic fields to the army to train
older enlistees to run athletic leagues
and other morale boosting programs
for troops overseas.

Humphreys said that in January
of 1943, the army ran a big recruiting
drive in Lexington, persuading about
150 W&L men to join up.

‘The army told them they could
be officers and they wouldn’t be
called up until after graduation,’’ he
said, ‘‘but they were all called up
about three weeks later and sent to
the Battle of the Bulge. A lot of those
boys were killed there.”’

The Marines called Humprheys
to active duty late in 1943, and since
he had enough credits to graduate at
the time, his diploma was sent to him
in the mail.

The few students who returned

to campus in the fall of 1944 were
welcomed by an editorial in The
Columns, a weekly publication that
stood in for the dormant Phi from
1943 through 1946:

“‘Today, Washington and Lee is
a far cry from the school in its
heyday. Little of the old life is left,
little of the social activities, little of
the sports, but the basic love of
learning and of fellowman is left.”’

Each week, The Columns’
headlines were grim reminders to
those left on campus:

“Alumni Office Reports
Koontz, Bagley Deaths”’
“Three Killed in Armed

Services Action in Germany and Iwo
Jima”’

The paper contained weekly
reports on regiments W&L men were
serving in, and recorded acts of

“Herbert Grooms Smith, Jr.,

After the Japanese Navy and Air
Force attacked the Pacific Fleet in
Pearl Harbor and the U.S. declared
war on the Axis powers, the Librarian
of Congress got nervous about the
safety of Washington D.C. and asked
that historic documents from the
national archives be moved out of the
city.

the Commerce School) was one of
five depositories that secretly held
original copies of the Declaration of
Independence, the Constitution, and
an original of the Magna Carta that
Britain had sent to the U.S. for
safekeeping. Four military guards
were on duty in the library 24 hours
a day to protect the documents.

Before Phi editor Ed Jackson
left for the service in 1943 he wrote
of the mood present at W&L at the
time:

“Washington and Lee has seen
the disillusioning, almost disastrous
effects of World War II. She reeled,
she staggered, but she kept on.”’

Humphreys went on to serve as
a second lieutenant in the Marines
and saw action in the Pacific Theater.

He said after the war, all those
who had received their degrees in
absentia like he had were invited back
to participate in the graduation
ceremony in June of 1946.

“That night we were all
together again singing and drinking,”’
he said. ‘‘In the moming everyone
went their own separate ways.’’

Humphreys said although the
war changed W&L in a lot of ways,
there is one thing he thinks nothing
can change about the school.

“The thing that has never
changed is the love the students have
for their school,’’ he said. ‘‘Even in
the face of all this PC stuff and after
the liberal decades, the students keep
their love for their school alive.

‘That distinction has belonged
to the student body. The faculty and
administration never had it. That

special mystique and honor, that
alone belongs to the students, just like
it always has.”’

Panati, author of Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things. Back then,
the ancient Babylonians swore they were going to start off the new year
right. They made resolutions such as these two most common: paying off
outstanding debts, and returning all borrowed farm equipment.

Nowadays, modern Americans still hold fast to this time honored
tradition, though what we hope to achieve at this new beginning varies
somewhat from our Babylonian forbearers. You may ask what the most
common contemporary resolutions are? To go on a diet and/or to quit
smoking.

On Campus some of the most common resolutions being made (and
most likely broken) are: to run every day, to lose ten pounds, to get
better grades, and to be more tolerant. No one was willing to go on the
record, however, in order to protect the privacy of their own bad habits.
Most students, are content with their lives as is, and have decided to pass
up resolution making for 1992.

From Payne

in search of the elusive A

 

By JOSHUA MANNING
Phi Staff Reporter

Continuing a Washington and Lee trend, last term’s
student grade point average rose to 2.93, almost a solid B,
but that’s only part of the story.

“We are awarding a greater percentage of A’s and
B’s,’’ University Registrar Scott Dittman said. ‘‘That is
reflected in the average student GPA.”’

The 1991-92 Registrar’s Report, released over break,
highlighted the fact that over 70 percent of the grades
awarded were either A’s or B’s. Failing grades dropped to
a 28-year low of 1.6 percent.

In the grade distribution breakdown for the 1990-91
academic year, the music and theater departments topped
the list of most A-range grades — A-plus, A, or A-minus

— awarded with 67 and 55 percent, respectively. Other
disciplines with top-heavy grade distributions included
military science, physical education, Greek, Chinese, art
and biology.

Greek also lead the list of most failing grades with
5.9 percent. Other disciplines with high failure rates
include mathematics and Latin.

While the distribution of grades by department
remains generally constant over the years, Dittman said
larger departments, such as English, would tend to have
more median grades, while smaller departments, such as
Greek, Latin and Chinese, would show a more erratic
distribution.

The numbers agreed. The English department
awarded the fewest A-range grades — 18 percent. The
Commerce School trio of administration, economics and
politics followed suit.

English Professor James Warren was surprised by
the distribution.

“*T would have thought that some of the departments
known for being difficult would have been lowest,’
Warren said. ‘‘One interpretation of this could be because
the English department places so much of an emphasis on
writing. Getting a superior grade on an essay is more dif-
ficult than on a mathematics or economics exam, for ex-
ample.”’

Warren, who has never given a final grade of A-
plus, believes his personal grade distribution of just below
3.0 is pretty close to the overall department average.

““It’s not easy to get an A, but anyone ought to be
able to get a B,’’ Warren said.

While the music department’s top-heavy grade dis-
tribution may have been affected by the large number of
students in the music ensembles, Music Professor

to duPont

Where the A’s are

Departments you’re most likely to get an A In:

Music: 68.5%

 

Theatre: 55.2%

Chinese: 51.7%

Departments you’re least likely to get an A in:

English: 18.6%

Economics: 20.3%

Administration: 20.4%

Figures are percentage of total grades given
that were in the A-plus to A-minus range.

Margaret Brouwer said it’s pretty hard to get an A in the
academic courses.

Brouwer, who grades most of her courses on a
straight curve, does not remember ever giving an A-plus
in an academic course.

The current grading system has been in place since
1983 when the plus and minus system was introduced,
Dittman said. Despite questions about the viability of the
A-plus grade, a survey a few years ago failed to find a
strong faculty preference either way.

“There are still people who don’t like to use it,”’
Dittman said. ‘‘As far as I’m concerned, A-plus should
only be given out in extremely unusual circumstances.”’

Theater Professor Albert Gordon said many of the
high grades in that department come in practical and
studio performance courses. Grades in these courses are
based on improvement and commitment, Gordon said.

Although Gordon hesitates to give out an A-plus
grade, his department leads the university in the category
with 12.8 percent.

Twelve o’clock and all is well
with the Co-op’s extended hours.

The Co-op remained open an
extra hour during weeknights for a
trial period during fall term.

‘The students are satisfied with
the hours so we are keeping them,”’
said Snack Bar Manager Donald
Burch.

Co-op Student Manager Marcy
Brown said that between 11 p.m. and
12 midnight only bagels and grilled
cheese sandwiches will be offered
from the grill.

A survey of Co-op customers
showed the grilled cheese to be the
most popular item after 8 p.m.

“‘Because of its popularity, we
will have a grill on the sandwich bar
that will make four sandwiches at
once,” Burch said.

Sophomore Aimee Wood said
the extra hour each night provides
motivation to study.

“I can get a boost of energy by
taking a Co-op break,’’ Wood said.

v RUSH continued from page 1
~~Stewart said sorority. members
will be looking for violations more
carefully during Rush week, and
rushees must share the responsibility
for obeying no-contact rules.

“‘T think all sororities have done
a good, job trying to protect
themselves and freshmen from rush
violations,” Stewart said. ‘‘The
burden is really going to be falling on
the freshmen women. If they go out,
they'll be putting themselves in
jeopardy.”

Meanwhile, some of Pi Phi’s
national officers and women from
their William and Mary chapter will
be on campus preparing for Rush.

“‘We feel that if we can get a
group of girls comparable in size to
the chapters existing here, we will be
successful and strong fairly quickly,”’
Caroline Lesh, Pi Phi’s Grand Vice
President of Membership, said at
W&L’s Panhellenic rally last semes-
ter.

W&L’s Panhellenic Council first
attempted to add a fourth sorority in
1990. That winter, Delta Gamma
Women’s Fraternity rushed women a

Rush, but the colonization attempt ©
failed because too few women attend-
ed DG’s parties.

In the fall of 1990, DG agreed to

participate in the next winter’s Rush. »

Eleven W&L women pledged DG in
September and prepared to rush at the
same time as the other sororities. This
second attempt also failed because too
few women selected DG as their first
choice, and the sorority left campus. ~

Of the 11 DG pledges at W&L,
nine were initiated into the DG
chapter at Roanoke College.

After DG’s failure, Panhellenic _
invited Pi Phi to the W&L campus.

“There’s really no danger [that Pi
Phi’s colonization will fail],’’ said
Panhellenic Secretary/Treasurer
Caroline Clarke
assured that they aren’t just going to
leave if they don’t get the numbers
they want.

“Our main concem is that we
don’t want what happened to DG to
be repeated.””

Slow W&L’s Brown

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE
Phi Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
men’s swimming team opened up the
Second part of their season last
Saturday with a 123-82 loss to a
tough College of Charleston team.

The meet was W&L’s first
since their triumph over VMI prior to
Christmas break. Despite the loss,
Coach Page Remillard was pleased
with his team’s performance.

 

 

Soderberg
paces W&L

By JACOB KIMBALL
Phi Staff Reporter

On December 6, 1991, in
only their second tournament of
the season, the Washington and
Lee wrestlers competed in the
Lebanon Valley Tournament.

The field consisted 20
teams and included some of the
top Division II wrestling
programs on the East Coast.
W&L finished 18th overall and
had some strong individual
performances.

Senior co-captain Peer
Soderberg won his first two
matches in the 167-pound
weight class. He advanced to
the quarterfinals, only to fall 4-0
to Anthony Spagnola of
Moravian.

Joining Soderberg in the
quarterfinals were freshman
Adam Williams and junior 190-
pounder John Conkling.
Williams advanced by upsetting
fourth seeded Todd Rupp of
Lebanon Valley 11-7 but fell in
the quarterfinals as did Conkling
after he recorded his team high
second pin of the season against
Tim Ayers of Albright.

The Generals return to
the mat after a long layoff on
January 11 in the Davidson
Quadrangular against Davidson,
Greensboro, and Anderson.

 

 

 

 

 

‘“‘We swam real well,’’
Remillard said. ‘‘In essence, we
equaled first term times, which is a
significant accomplishment
considering how hard we worked over
the last 10 days or so.”’

The hard work will pay off,
Remillard said.

“You'll see times improve
because we have the kids following a
system that will help them peak at the
right time.”’

The right time for senior Doug
Brown seems to be every time he
dives in the pool. He posted another
three win-meet against Charleston, the
only General to post a win. It was the
third straight meet in which Brown
has won three times. He captured the
500-yard freestyle, the 200-yard
freestyle and the 200-yard butterfly.

‘Doug swam real well,’’ said
Remillard. ‘“The team as a whole,
though, is in good shape. The
disruption in the season is a little

hard, but we used the break well and
I believe the kids will hit their peaks
at the end of the season in the
championship meets.”’

The layoff wasn’t long enough
to cool Brown down.

‘‘The layoff wasn’t that long.
We’ve been back training pretty hard
and we’re in good shape,’’ said
Brown. ‘‘We expect to peak just
before the championship meets and in
the past we've had over 90 percent of
our guys swim there best times,’’ he
added.

Remillard, despite the loss, is
confident in his team’s attitude.

“Our kids have what every
championship team has, an upbeat
and focused attitude. They believe in
themselves and each other. Once they
get into the competitive phase of our
plan, they will definitely see times
getting consistently better,’’ Remillard

Marlins end Generals’ streak

 

By JAY PLOTKIN
Phi Sports Editor

 

After shooting well over 50
percent in winning the Washington
and Lee Invitational over the
weekend, the W&L basketball team
found out what life is like when the
ball doesn’t bounce the right way.

The Generals led Virginia
Wesleyan 27-26 at halftime in
Wednesday night’s game in the
Warner Center after shooting 52
percent in the first half. But W&L
went cold in the second half,
shooting just 35 percent, and the
Marlins were able to come back for
a 64-56 win. W&L shot 42 percent
for the game.

The loss was frustrating for
head coach Verne Canfield.

‘‘We didn’t get beat, we
lost,’’ he said. ‘‘We didn’t shoot
well because we didn’t work our
offense and we didn’t establish an
inside game.”’

Without an inside game, the
Generals were forced to rely on
outside shooting. Junior Bryan
Watkins’ hot hand turned cold in the
second half. Watkins led the way for
W&L with 16 points, but scored just
four after intermission on two of 11
shooting.

Freshman John Rogers
showed the hot hand, scoring 13
points (a career high) on five of
seven shooting and two three point
shots.

Rogers scored four straight
points midway through the second
half to give the Generals a 42-41
lead, but that was the last time the
Generals led. Rick Chalk scored 14
of his game-high 18 points and
grabbed 11 of his game-high 13
rebounds in the second half to lead

the Marlins to the win.

“‘We had a great first half,
and we were nip and tuck with them
in the second half,’’ said Canfield.
“‘Then we missed some shots and
had to go for the bali at the end.”’

W&L rallied late and forced
some turnovers (18 on the night),
but couldn’t make the shots fall to
catch the Marlins. A Rogers three-
point shot brought the Generals
within four at 56-52 with 1:11 left,
but Chalk made six free throws in
the final minute to ice the win.

“‘I can remember three times
where three-point shots went around
the rim and came back out,”’ said
Canfield. ‘‘That will happen. We
got disheartened when it happened,
and we can’t do that. When that
happens, we need to really work the

Watkins leads

General
tourney

By JAY PLOTKIN
Phi Sports Editor

One game does not a career
make, but that one game sure can
help turn a season around.

Last weekend in the Washington
and Lee Invitational, the Generals got
career highs from two players on
back-to-back nights and won the
tournament, beating Bowdoin on
Friday and Colorado College on
Saturday.

“We finally put some things
together,”’ said head coach Verne
Canfield. ‘‘We’ve been urging the
kids to succeed, and we did.”’

On Friday, junior guard Bryan
Watkins emerged from a season-long
shooting slump to score a career-high
25 points on nine-of-14 shooting,
including four three-point goals and
sophomore Robert Miggins added
career-highs in points (14) and
rebounds (13) as the Generals topped
Bowdoin’s Polar Bears 77-67.

 

 

   

 

 

Bowdoin led 22-21 with 7:51 left
in the first half, but Watkins scored
eight of his 17 first-half points in a
row and found Miggins for a basket
as the Generals reeled off an

11-2 run to take control of the game
and lead 39-32 at the half.

In the second half, W&L opened
up a 15-point lead on_ several
occasions and held off a late Bowdoin
rally for the win.

W&L shot 56.8 percent for the
game, the first time all season the
Generals had shot better than 43
percent.

““We worked on our shooting
more during the break,’’ said
Canfield, ‘‘and it paid off. It is
something we will continue to work
hard on it.”’

On Saturday, the Generals
continued their hot streak from the
field against a Colorado College team
that brought a nine-game winning
streak onto the floor. The Generals
also got career-high performances
from two other players to aid the
cause.

The Generals quickly jumped out
to a 7-0 lead on baskets by senior
Mark Melton, a three-pointer from
Watkins and sophomore Paul Baker.
Colorado came back to take a brief
lead at 19-18, but the Generals
opened up a seven-point halftime

lead. Watkins was the leader again,
scoring 14 points in the half, and the
Generals shot 64 percent.

 

 

 

 

Miggins

In the second half, Melton took
over the game. His basket started the
Generals on a 14-6 mn_ before
Colorado began bombing away at the
lead. The Tigers hit seven second half
three-pointers forcing head coach
Verne Canfield to use four time outs.

But each time Canfield called a
time out, W&L responded with a
basket. After one time out sophomore
Bryant Pless hit two free throws to
start a 6-0 run to force a Colorado
time out. Melton scored immediately
after another time out to push the lead
back up to 55-45.

Colorado got within one point at
79-78, but junior Bryan Brading
rebounded a missed three point shot
and made both free throws after being
fouled with 16 seconds left, and
Baker iced the game with two more
foul shots with three seconds left to
preserve the 83-78 win.

““We beat a team that was clearly
better than we were,”’ said Canfield.
“Everyone did his part. Mark
[Melton] took the ball to the hole and
scored. Watkins penetrated well and
hit his three point shots. Our two
point guards [Brading and sophomore
Matt Newton] had just two turnovers
between them. That’s terrific.”’

Melton scored 14 second half
points on six-of-six shooting and a
career-high 20 on the night on nine-
of-10 shooting and Baker added 12
points and eight rebounds, both career
highs in the win. Watkins finished
with 18 points.

While Melton and Watkins led the
way, everyone contributed.

“‘Miggins is coming on,’’ said
Canfield. ‘‘He’s getting a lot of
deflections. [Sophomore Bryant] Pless
(nine points vs. Colorado) and
Newton didn’t dress last year, but
they stuck it out and both contributed
some big plays down the stretch.”’

The two wins upped the Generals’
record to 3-6 on the season.

Watkins scored 43 points on 17 of
27 (63 percent) shooting to earn
tournament Most Valuable Player
honors. He came into the tournament
shooting a paltry 34.6 percent from
the field. Melton was also named to
the All-Tournament team.

The Washington and Lee
women’s swimming team returned to

rudely splashed in the face.

The Generals got a taste of the
difference between Division III

swimming and Division I swimming
when the College of Charleston

Saturday.

Coach Kiki Jacobs thought her
team swam well, all things
considered. The team entered the
meet fresh off a week of intense

training.

“‘The team swam really well,”’
Jacobs said. ‘‘Most of the team
remained at their [early-season] times
or were a little bit better.’’

Junior Claire Dudley won top
honors for the Generals. She came in
second in both the 200-yard
individual medley and the 500-yard

freestyle. Against the Division I
opponent, Dudley’s season best times
weren’t enough to win.

Sophomore Kari May swam
her season’s best time in the 1000-
yard freesytle, the 200-yard individual
medley and the 200-yard backstroke.

Women wrap up
fourth Rush

 

By PAMELA KELLEY
Phi Associate Editor

‘

 

More than 100 women are ex-
‘pected to accept bids this evening
, from one of Washington and Lee’s

three established sororities or its Pi
* Beta Phi colony.
, _W&L’s fourth sorority Rush
ended last night. Rushees gathered in
» the university Dining Hall after the
, last set of parties to rank the sorori-
ties in order of preference.

According to Panhellenic Presi-
dent Dale Wyatt, 160 women attend-
ed the opening Rush parties on Fri-
day. Wyatt declined to release the
number of women who signed prefer-
ence cards last night.

Bid matching, the process by
which sorority representatives choose
new members, began this morning
and lasted into the early afternoon.

While Wyatt said she thought the
Rush was successful, PHC Rush
Chairman Brannon Aden said the
degree of its success depends on how*”
many girls pledge the new colony.

‘*We won’t know how successful,
until we find out what happened with
Pi Phi,’’ Aden said.

‘We knew this would be chal-
lenging,’’ Pi Phi Grand Vice Presi-
dent of Membership Carolyn Lesh
commented on the sorority’s first
Rush at W&L. ‘‘We feel very posi-
tive. We have put our best foot for-
ward.”’ :

Pi Phi is the second sorority
invited by the PHC to open a chapter
at W&L. Delta Gamma sorority left

ful colonization attempts.

In 1990 DG put off colonization
when too few women attended its
first Rush party. After last year’s
Rush, the sorority refused to colonize
because it said too few women select-
ed it as their first choice.

However, Lesh, who has worked
on the colonization for several months
said she is confident Pi Phi will suc-
ceed.

‘*We were very pleased with the
way the parties went. I feel like the
rushees responded,’’ she said.

Lesh said Pi Phi is committed to
do whatever will make the colony a
successful one.

“It is our number one priority,
extension-wise, for the year,’’ she
said.

According to an agreement be-
tween the Pi Phi national leadership
and PHC, Pi Phi may extend bids to
almost half the rushees. As a result,
the other three sororities were allowed
to extend bids to up to twenty girls
“wach: ier oe +

Lesh said she was hesitant to
discuss numbers. She said Pi Phi
hopes to gain around 60 pledges from
Rush week, and may later extend bids
to more rushees.

‘‘We are committed. If we don’t
reach that [number] we will not
leave,’’ she said.

This Rush also marked the last
for founding members of the first
three sororities. Sororities came to
WAL in 1989. The last set of charter
members of Kappa, Theta and Chi
Omega pledged the sororities as fres-
hmen and will graduate this year.

Perkins: Delt could be gone

SAC to render decision
on chapter’s fate Friday

 

By THOMAS EISENHAUER
Phi Senior Copy Editor

 

Executive Committee President
Giles Perkins said he ‘‘would not be
surprised’ if the Student Affairs
Committee kicked Delta Tau Delta
off campus Friday for vandalizing
much of the interior of its house.

“I would not be surprised if Delt
were expelled or suspended,’’ Perkins
said,

Delt President Chris Barker and
House Corporation President Taylor
Cole will report to SAC on the
damage to the house at 2 p.m. Friday,
Dean of Students David Howison
said. SAC will then either do nothing,
expel the chapter, suspend it for any
number of years or place it on
“critical probation,’ SAC’s strongest
waming, Howison said.

Cole said he discovered the
damage to the house on Dec. 22,
Windows were broken, walls
destroyed, ceiling tiles removed and a
brick bar dismantled sometime before
members moved out to make way for
the January renovation of the house.

Perkins said he hopes Delt can
explain its actions, but that the
damage appears to have been
intentional.

“I hope they can tell us that it’s
not as bad as it looks, but from the
pictures I’ve seen this is a very
serious breach of both the Standards
for Fraternities and the conduct we
expect from our students,’’ he said.

Perkins said he saw about 40
photographs of the interior of the Delt
house that suggest that members of

the chapter purposefully vandalized

their house.

 
   

  
  

“It looks like it was systematic
destruction of property,”’ Perkins said.
“‘It was more than someone putting
his hand through a window,”’ Perkins
said.

The Delt House Corporation
responded to the destruction by
suspending Delt’s participation in the
Fraternity Renaissance program
pending an investigation of the
damage. Additionally, the national
fraternity and the house corporation
have placed the chapter on probation,
according to Howison.

Howison
said SAC will
judge Delt in
the context of
the Standards
for Fraterni-
ties, which
regulate all
fraternity ac-
tions. He said
i SAC discussed
aie the issue initial-
Perkins ly last Friday.

“After last Friday’s meeting,
there was definitely cause for con-
cern,”’ he said.

Cole agreed that the house was
damaged seriously, but said the chap-
ter can overcome the episode.

‘‘The thing happened, and there’s
no excuse,’’ Cole said. ‘“The matter
now is to make sure it doesn’t happen
again here or anywhere else on cam-
pus.”’
He said critical probation would
be the most constructive measure for
Delt and the entire fraternity system.

“Critical probation gives the
fraternity and the house corporation
and the system as a whole a chance

said. ‘‘I hope it goes that way.”’
Despite the incident, Delt still has
a future at W&L, Cole said.

The largest fundraising
campaign in Washington and

next month, even though nearly
half of its $127 million goal has
been raised already.

About $54 million has

He’s running six months late,
but Old George is finally coming
back to Washington and Lee — and
he’s bringing friends.

The old wooden statue of
George Washington that stood atop
Washington Hall for 150 years could
be back in Lexington as early as
March, according to Branko
Medenika, the sculptor from
Birmingham, Ala., who is restoring
the statue.

Accompanying Old George will
be two new statues, one made of
bronze and the other of fiberglass.

Although university officials
originally considered unveiling the
new bronze figure during Mock
Convention in March, — students
probably will not see the figure until
May.

According to Assistant Alumni
Director Robert Mish, the unveiling
of the statue will probably occur on
Alumni Weekend after the Friday
evening cocktail party on the Front
Lawn.

Mish said the Alumni Office has
contacted spotlight engineers and a
company to give a fireworks display
at the unveiling.

However, Director of
Communications Brian Shaw said
plans have not been finalized for the
unveiling ceremony. Shaw said the

It’s not easy keeping such
a gigantic campaign a secret

Nobel Peace Prize winner and
former Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias will speak at Washington and
Lee on Jan. 23 on ‘‘Lasting Security
in the Post-Cold War Era.”’

Arias is the latest achievement for
the Telford Distinguished Lecture
Series, which also booked former
U.S. President Jimmy Carter to speak
in April.

The series was endowed by the
late Robert Lee Telford, °22, and
Arias will be its first guest.

A native of Costa Rica, Arias
holds a master’s degree in economics
and political science from the London
School of Economics and a Ph.D. in
political science he attained in 1974

 

from the University of Essex.
He was elected president of Costa

Rica in 1986. As president, Arias pro- }

moted development and democracy in

Costa Rica, propelling the small na- |

tion to notoriety as one of the most
peaceable, democratic and economi-
cally advanced nations in Central
America.

Arias’ efforts for Central Ameri-
can peace culminated with the Central
American Peace Plan in August 1987,
under which regional presidents com-
mitted to dialogue and consensus to
solve problems.

In 1988, Arias used the money
from his Nobel Prize to create the
Arias Foundation for Peace and Hu-
man Progress, which promotes the
welfare of the needy in society.

Michael Dukakis, the 1988
Democratic presidential candidate, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson and former Speak-
er of the House Thomas ». ‘‘Tip’’
O’Neill are slated to speak at this
year’s Mock Convention.

MC has also invited Virginia
Gov. Douglas Wilder and the six
remaining major Democratic candi-
dates, said MC Political Chairman
Jamie Tucker.

Wilder recently ended his bid
for the Democratic nomination, say-
ing that Virginia’s current budget
crisis took precedence over his na-
tional campaign.

Tucker said the candidates will
not commit to MC appearance until
after the Feb. 18 New Hampshire
primary.

‘‘We’re right before Super
Tuesday, and Virginia is not partici-
pating,’’ Tucker said. ‘“That’s kind of
a drawback, so we’re trying to plug
our Southerness.”’

MC Speakers Chairman Ted
Elliott said most candidates will be
campaigning in states holding prima-
ries on Super Tuesday during the
convention, but he remains hopeful.

‘*They’ve never had an actual
candidate at Mock Convention,”’
Elliott said. ‘But I have my fingers
crossed.”’

The national media will most

Bring back
Old George

For 150 years he graced the top of Washington Hall,
standing guard over our university through good and bad,
through the dark days of the Civil War, through the
presidency of General Lee, through two world wars, and
through the coming of co-education. But two years ago he
disappeared.

Old George is almost ready to come back, but the
tendency for our administration to make a special occasion
out of everything that might possibly generate some hype
will probably delay his return a few more months.

The university wants to plan an event for Alumni
Weekend, a great unveiling ceremony that will show off
George’s facelift and, no doubt, impress a few alums. But
that implies Old George is there for the alums, and he is
not. Old George represents Washington and Lee. He is
tradition; he is here for us.

Whether standing guard over the Colonnade during the
Battle of Lexington, dressed in a tuxedo for Fancy Dress, or
calmly enduring another whitewash, George has been there
in good times and bad. We, the current students, are the
heart and soul of this university. We want George back as
soon as possible. Don’t play politics with Old George. He
deserves to be back home. His empty pedestal serves only
as a constant reminder that someone is missing.

It is said George will be ready before Mock Convention.
Why wait three more months? What more fitting an
occasion can there be for George’s return than having the
first president of the United States watch the university he
saved do its small part in the presidential election process?

Our advice to the administration: don’t wait any longer.
Many of us have never even seen Old George, but everyone
knows where he belongs. It’s never a bad idea to celebrate
Old George, but don’t stall his return. Bring him back as
soon as possible, but throw a party over Alumni Weekend
anyway.

Don’t rush
winter Rush

The current Long Range Plan, written in 1989, calls for
the institution of fraternity winter Rush by January 1993.
While it is a foregone conclusion that the administration has
missed that deadline, the Student Affairs Committee has
been discussing the logistics of the move for about a month.

But let’s not forget the danger in such a move.
Washington and Lee is not ready for winter Rush, nor will
it be in the foreseeable future. Besides causing mass
confusion, the move would completely disrupt our carefully
balanced social system and financially destabilize several
fraternities by forcing each to host a full term of Rush-like
parties.

Winter Rush stands only in the very distant future, if at
all. It must be the last step in a redesigned social system.
The university is only in the planning phases of the first
step: the new student center. We should only begin serious
discussion of winter Rush after this phantom student center
is built, fully operational and serving the purpose its
supporters seem to think it will. Only then will freshmen
have another viable social alternative.

Rarely does one encounter an event which justifies the ,
use of cliches; listening to either football commentators or
Spectator columnists will quickly prove my point. Yet the *
induction of Professor John Gunn into Omicron Delta ,
Kappa — in recognition of his invaluable service to Mr.
Lee’s College — permits me to utter the hackneyed phrase :
“better late than never.”’ I would like to publicly offer my
congratulations and to briefly introduce the ‘‘Tailgunner’’
to those Washington and Lee students who have not had ,
the opportunity to take any of his educational and highly
entertaining courses.

Professor Gunn symbolizes the uniqueness of Wash-
ington and Lee. One can wax poetic about the grandeur of
the Colonnade and the majestic stillness of Lee Chapel, but .

Statistics say that one out of every six college
women is the victim of rape, and surveys of the
freshman class each year back the fact up here at
WAL. Statistics, one way of looking at such a
terrible problem, allows us the luxury of non-
involvement. Unfortunately, this is an issue that we
must become involved in, because it does affect
each and every one of us. Name six women that
you know and try to figure out which one has been
through that horrible experience. I’m one of the one
of six women.

When I started my freshman year at W&L, I
was scared, like most freshmen. I was alone and in
a totally new situation with very little supervision.
I met quite a few people quickly and soon had a
circle of friends to eat with in the D-hall. One of
the guys in the group caught my attention, and
soon we were becoming close. It was nice to have
someone that I felt close to. I had been slightly
homesick before that.

We saw each other for a while and even went
on a few dates. One Friday night, about a month
into term, we went out on a date, dinner and a
movie. Then we went back to his place for a while,
since his roommate was out of town. We lay on his
bed for a while, the only piece of furniture in his
room other than the two desks, talking, laughing
and having a good time, when he decided to kiss
me heatedly. I told him before any clothes were re-
moved that I didn’t want to have sex with him.
Apparently, he didn’t hear me, because he pinned

SCC officer
defends methods

To the Editor:

On the heels of the appalling wreckage of
the reputations of both William Kennedy Smith
and Justice Clarence Thomas, I am quite sur-
prised that any responsible person would not see
that publicity given to accusations is indeed a
questionable aspect of our society. In both of
these notorious cases, the innocent parties, whom-
ever you may perceive them to be, were consider-
ably damaged by the extensive press exposure.
And yet in last week’s issue of The Ring-tum Phi,
the Editor calls for the same type of publicity for
any individual in our community accused of even
the smallest discipline infraction.

No one doubts that the American press is an
invaluable asset in keeping government honest,
but here at Washington and Lee our obligation on
the Student Conduct Committee is to deal with
issues of discipline which, especially in such a
small world, can permanently affect the com-
munity’s perception of one of its members. As
everyone knows, denials and vindications rarely,
if ever, receive publicity equal to that given
accusations.

 

me on the bed, pulled my clothes off and raped me,
all the while I was trying to push him off me and
get away while repeatedly saying, ‘‘No!’’

This was a guy I trusted; a friend and some-
one I had been seeing for a month. This wasn’t the
first time that he had kissed me like that, and it
wasn’t even the first time that we had been alone
together. I thought that I could trust him, and I
learned the hard way how wrong I was.

 

Our system leaves millions of
women in the same position that !
was in; alone, afraid and with very
few options. Something must be
done to stop this.

 

So what was I supposed to do? He was just
as much a part of my circle of friends as I was. I
couldn’t ask my very new friends to take a side. I
was afraid that they would believe him, and I
would have lost my only friends at W&L. So I kept
my mouth shut and tried to deal with it without
telling anyone.

By the beginning of my sophomore year, I
had still told no one, and I came very close to a
nervous breakdown from all the guilt and shame of
blaming myself for something that was most
definitely not my fault. When I finally told one of
my friends, I discovered that she has been through
much the same thing. The more friends I told, the
more I realized that I wasn’t alone. With their help,
I started to put my life back together.

Today things are much better, but occasional-

LETTERS

A sharp distinction needs to be made be-
tween an investigative body, such as the SCC,
and an adversarial criminal system, such as in
American courts of law. Our commission is to
keep the community functioning smoothly and
uphold the norms of gentlemanly and lady-like
conduct. For this reason, we have as much re-
sponsibility to the accuser as to the accused.
After all, the real purpose that this committee
serves is to leave all parties involved in a happy
and productive relation with the university com-
munity, rather than crushing one side or the other
in the dispute.

The Editor attacks the $CC’s investigative
process because it lacks a process of appeal
equivalent to the Executive Committee’s open
trial. This analogy is imprecise. Honor violations
deal primarily with a student’s contract with the
community as a whole. Therefore, he has the
right to adjudicate his dispute in front of the
entire student body. In short, the EC keeps its
actions confidential until the individual accused
finds it in his best interest to do otherwise. By
contrast, the SCC, in most cases, deals with
infractions of the discipline code by an individual
or individuals, ranging from personal quarrels and
fights to violations of dormitory rules, which do
not, as a rule, involve the community and will

 

not merely concem |

economics, mathematics, philosophy or physics. From my
discussions and arguments with Professor Gunn, I learned :
that honorable behavior goes beyond the classroom and that |
Mozart is sometimes superior to Billy Joel. He showed me -
that unexamined political beliefs (including my unhealthy «
attachment to ‘‘supply-side’’ economics) are actually more _
dangerous than a lack of political conviction, that perhaps
the academic world has a little more to offer than the sterile «
but wealthy life of a commercial litigator, and that the
Socratic method is a valuable tool and not simply the °
weapon of choice for fascist-like professors. Finally, he «
demonstrated that friendship plays an indispensable role in _
the bond between teacher and student.

I believe that induction into Omicron Delta Kappa is ,
the highest honor that Washington and Lee can bestow,
since the society stands for the university’s core values: ©
preservation of honor, commitment to tradition, dedication .
to service and pursuit of intellectual inquiry. When one
considers the almost five decades of service that Professor ©
Gunn has given to Washington and Lee, he or she would ,
be hard-pressed to name another individual who more
reflects the principles of ODK. Congratulations, Professor '

Todd C. Peppers graduated in 1990.

ly I still get extremely depressed. I have trouble’
trusting men, but I’ve met a few that have con-,
vinced me that all men aren’t like that. I still panic
when I see him on the Hill or at a party. Just’
seeing him brings back some painful memories. ,

Our circle of friends drifted apart as the year
progressed, and last year I even told one of them’
what had happened. He said that, having heard both,
sides of the story, the guy didn’t look at what
happened in nearly the same way I did. He saw it’
as a mutually agreed upon action and couldn’t,
figure out why I was so hostile toward him when
he tried to take me out again.

So you see, date rape does happen at WAL,
I’m not road cheese, we were both sober and I
didn’t lead him on and then change my mind. Now'
think, out of every six women that you know, one,
may have a story similar to mine. Actually, the
figure is probably much higher because most’
women don’t report things like this, even in sur-,
veys. I didn’t when I filled out my questionnaire
freshman year because I didn’t see a purpose in it.’
I didn’t think anyone would believe me if I said,
anything, and it was all my fault anyway for having
been alone with him.

Our system leaves millions of women in the,
same position that I was in; alone, afraid and with
very few options. Something must be done to stop’
this, and it has to start with the potential rapists out,
there. Think before you act, because what you
perceive to be an agreed upon act may not be. I’
now realize that there were things that I could have.
done to protect myself, but I’m not the one who
forced someone to have sex with him. :

not affect the community as a whole. Therefore,
these issues are investigated and, if necessary,
adjudicated confidentially by the SCC,

More troubling than any of the above issues
is the Phi's serious misunderstanding of the
delegation of authority. The SCC operates as the
delegated authority of the W&L student body. It
does not operate as a body with an individual
agenda. This delegation self-evidently was made
precisely to spare all the parties involved of the
embarrassment of publicity over issues which
vary from unfounded charges to those of a more
serious nature, The whole point of delegating this
authority to a confidential committee is to keep
these issues out of casual Co-op chatter. Does the
Phi really want the reputation of every student at
W&L to be subject to the judgement of people
hearing complicated and sensitive matters in a
fragmented or second-hand way?

Everyone is familiar with the old joke that
a liberal is a conservative who has been arrested,
and a conservative is a liberal who has been
mugged. In our case, I think that The Ring-tum
Phi's argument for publicity is the argument of a
student that has never been threatened by the
destructive powers of a frivolous accusation,

Pub Board appoints Walsh magazine

 

By JASON KELLEY
Phi Editor

The Publications Board Monday
night appointed junior Jimmy Walsh
sole editor of the new magazine it
voted to create in November.

Three applicants for the position
were interviewed by the board. Senior
Paul Mazyck, one of the three, was
asked and agreed to serve as business
manager for the magazine.

Amid Pub Board anxiety that the

new magazine would become a
Traveller with student funding, Walsh
said he is committed to presenting
differing viewpoints in his
publication.

“I'd like to make it perfectly
clear that I’d like articles from
students with different ideals. The
Spectator staff can send in articles if
they want,’’ Walsh said. ‘‘The only
criterion the articles will be judged on
will be the quality of the writing, not
the political viewpoint.’’

Walsh is the former business
manager of the Traveller. He said
with the formation of the Pub Board’s
new magazine, the Traveller has
ceased to exist.

He said he hopes to publish the
new magazine once every six weeks.
Before the first issue, he will present
a tentative budget and plans for the
magazine’s layout to the Pub Board,
which will pay only the costs of the
first issue. A name for the publication
will be chosen by its staff.

The sounds of music at W&L
Prof. hits the big time!

 

By FRANCESCA KEFALAS
Phi Entertainment Editor

 

The song *“‘New York New York’’ says ‘‘if you can
make it there, you’ll make it anywhere.’ A Washington
and Lee professor is about to find out.

Margaret Brouwer, assistant professor of music and
composer in residence, will be in the spotlight on Jan. 31,
in New York City. Her composition Third From The Sun
will be played at 8 p.m. in the Alice Tully Hall of Lincoln
Center.

The Juliard Orchestra, one of the nation’s best
college orchestras according to Brouwer, will play Third
From The Sun, as part of the week long Focus Festival of
contemporary music. Brouwer said she believes her
composition will be the only orchestral piece featured.

Brouwer will also be one of several composers
featured at a round table panel discussion.

The St. Louis Symphony Orchestra played Third

 

 

 

 

 

Brouwer

From The Sun a few years ago, according to Brouwer.
After hearing the piece she decided to revise the first
movement citing that it was too long and just didn’t work
the way she had planned.

Brouwer said she completed the revisions in early
1991. The New York performance will be the first time
the piece has been performed in its current form.

“It will be very gratifying to finally hear it,’’
Brouwer said.

Seattle Orchestra will be guest conductor of the Juliard
Orchestra. Kendell approached Brouwer about performing

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Third From The Sun, after hearing a taped recording of
the piece.

“It’s very difficult for contemporary composers to
get their music played. This was just one of those things,”’
she said.

Most pieces are commissioned, according to
Brouwer, which sets guidelines and restrictions on the
composer. Sometimes, however, a composer will be able
to write freely from their own ideas, which is the nicest
experience, according to Brouwer.

She will have such an opportunity soon. Victoria
Bond of the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra asked Brouwer
to compose a piece for the orchestra. Brouwer said she
had ideas for an orchestra piece last summer, but was
reluctant to spend too much time on it because she had no
idea if it would ever be played. Now she has a forum for
the piece

Brouwer has also had her compositions recorded. In
1987 Aurolucent Echo’ s, a piece for solo harp, percussion,
strings and what Brouwer calls echo harp was recorded.
The New Mexico Brass Quintet has also recorded her
piece Timespan.

Brouwer expects two more of her compositions,
titled Two Pieces For Viola and SCHerZOide to be
released in this summer.

Brouwer began her career as a violinist, before
choosing to devote more of her time to composing. She

| said she loves playing the violin, but has always done
various creative things such as writing poetry and music.

“I seem to be the type of person who needs an
outlet of creative expression,’”’ Brouwer said.

In order to make room for the time demands of
composing, Brouwer decided to teach college level music
courses, Teaching at W&L allows her to pursue both her
interests in the violin and composition.

“It is the job for me.’ Brouwer said.

Brouwer also founded, and is acting director, otf
Sonoklect, a new music festival held annually at W&L
during spring term. The festival features compositions
from well known contemporary composers, and students
from other schools who won the right to attend through a
competition. This will be the third year of existence for
Sonoklect.

Auditions were held last week
for four openings in Jubilee, W&L’s
most exclusive women’s singing
group.

The new members will help
continue the six-year-old Jubilee style
and manner of bringing music to
Washington and Lee.

Kristin Barnes and Christie
Davis founded the group in 1987.
Jubilee sings mainly pop songs from
the 30’s, 40’s and 60’s in addition to
occasional folk songs. Their
performances are usually scheduled
by the Alumni House. In the past
they have sung for local civic groups,

senior receptions, and of course at
choral concerts as often as three times
a month.

Jubilee is self-governed and
entirely self-sufficient financially.
Business manager Sarah Briggs
explained that decisions are a group
effort. This includes the choosing of
the music which the women vote on
before purchasing.

“Everyone is involved in
making decisions,’’ said Briggs.
Professor Alexandra R.

Brown is the group’s faculty adviser.
She assists with auditions and is
always present before a tour.
According to new member and
freshman Melissa Wolf, there is a
spirit of professionalism, friendship,

Some of the 1990-91 members of Jubilee may be gone, but there are new members waiting in the wings.

Jubilee makes the music sing

and fun that is diffused throughout
Jubilee, which was as equally
attractive as the types of music they
sing.

She and the other new
members, sophomore Ellen Dean, and
freshmen Lucy Cavett and Mandy
Irons will join the eleven previous
members of the group. Jubilee
contains a fairly equal distribution of
altos, second sopranos, and first
sopranos.

Many of the Jubilee singers
are in the Women’s Chorus or the
University Chorus as well. Jubilee’s
next performance will be January 18
at the Independent Union’s ‘‘Winter
Picnic in Lex Vegas”’ in the Warner
Center.

The Ring-tum Phi, January 16, 1992

By RANDY DEVERE
Phi Staff Reporter

For those student broadcasters who got
cricks in their necks during Channel 9 newscasts,
and the sportscasters who lugged tons of equipment
to Generals’ games, the Journalism Department’s
latest acquisitions are indeed manna from heaven.

With a new computer system that includes
teleprompters, and a portable Telephone Interface
System for WLUR, Reid Hall has been transformed
into a broadcast center that would be the envy of
many professional stations.

The new ‘‘Electronic News Room’’ system,
with a price tab of between twenty and thirty
thousand dollars, was installed at the beginning of
the school year. There were several reasons for the
purchase, according to Professor of Journalism
Ronald H. MacDonald, who along with Professor
of Journalism and head of the department Hampden
H. Smith initially researched the system.

“There has been a sizable increase in the
number of journalism majors over the last four
years or so, and that was putting too much pressure

J-School moves into the 21st century

The system has now been fully implement-
ed, and has permitted a greater degree of coopera-
tion between the various upper-level broadcasting
courses.

‘*We can now integrate at least three classes
at once,’’ said MacDonald. ‘‘We can have students
from the Advanced Broadcast News, Broadcast
Newswriting, and TV Production classes in the lab
working together.’’

In addition to making the Channel 9 news-
casts sharper in appearance, the ENR has had
another effect.

 

The ENR, used by many small
professionals, is a boon for both
students and faculty.

 

‘‘T have actually seen improved writing
for the newscasts, which is something that I
didn’t expect,’’ MacDonald said.

The other new addition to the J-School

has benefitted the radio station. According to de

Maria, the new Telephone Interface is the result
of conversations between the department and
Richard Spence ’91 and Franklin Daniels ’91,
who were the chairmen of the Student Telephone
Union last year. Seeing the need for a new phone
system, STU donated the $900 system to WLUR,
a gift that primarily will effect sports broadcasts.

The Interface allows a student to broadcast
from anywhere in the country where the Generals
play sports, without the aid of others. While this
might suggest images of ‘‘Saturday Night
Live’s’’ Al Franken carrying a satellite on his
back, the Interface is actually no bigger than a
laptop computer. It can hold up to four microp-
hones, and it contains two phone hookups, which
allow for clear and easy transmission of athletic
events directly to WLUR. According to de Maria,
this new system not only benefits the J-School
and the university as a whole, but one student in
particular.

“‘Now Jay Plotkin has job security be-
cause he’s the only person who knows how to
use the thing,’’ de Maria said. ‘‘At least, he
thinks he is.’’

 

on a lab that was designed for a
newspaper,”’ said MacDonald.
““We knew that we needed a dis-
tinct broadcasting lab.”’

But there was a more read-
ily apparent motivation that prom-
pted the department to act.

‘When we saw the way
our newscasts looked, well, we
desperately needed telepromp-
ters,’’ MacDonald concluded with
a smile.

This facilitated the pur-
chase of the ENR, which, accord-
ing to Professor Robert de Maria,
"brings the newscast to a new
dimension." The system eliminates
the need for hard copy, as all
writing and teleprompting takes
place electronically. In addition,
the system receives the latest
Associated Press and UPI reports,
and allows for the cataloguing of
all broadcast tapes.

The ENR, used by many
small professional stations, is a
boon for both students and faculty,
according to de Maria.

“Tt provides a_ greater
opportunity for the faculty to work
closely with the kids, and it makes
the students more marketable as
they look for jobs in broadcast-
ing,’’ de Maria said. ‘‘It also

W&L students won't buy
Cheating at Bookstore

 

By JOYCE BAUTISTA
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Cheating just doesn’t sell at Washington
and Lee.

Although Cheating 101: The Benefits and
Fundamentals of Earning the Easy ‘A,’ a satiric
book on cheating written by a student at Rutgers
University, has sold well at other schools, the
W&L Bookstore would probably not carry it,
according to Helena Roller, manager of the
bookstore.

“The title is enough to repel me,’’ Roller
said. *“We don’t think a book of that sort would
interest the students of W&L.

“Our kids are a little scornful about the
cheating business,’’ Roller said. ‘‘Some may not
do all the work but they are ready to take the
lumps.”’

Using his Macintosh computer, Michael
Moore has published the 86-page book, which
has already sold 1,000 copies through mail order
ads in student newspapers at Rutgers, the
University of Maryland and Ohio State
University.

Moore has compiled cheating methods
from teachers and students at Rutgers and
several other colleges as evidence that most stu-

dents cheat. For example, he says students cheat
by hiding crib notes inside the holes of ripped
jeans.

Despite its popularity, the book has caused
such an outrage that most bookstores in and
around Rutgers have refused to carry the book,
according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.
Moore said he feels that professors are upset
because the book points out their shortcomings.

“‘Cheating has become the American
way,’’ Moore writes. ‘“‘There are so many
different cheaters to emulate that it is actually
hard to choose a role model.”’

But the concept of Moore’s ‘step-by-step
stroll along academic Easy Street,’’ does not
appeal to some W&L students.

*‘Cheating is such a non-issue here, it’s not
even on people’s minds,’’ freshman Megan
McCloskey said. ‘‘People don’t think about it.
People don’t care about it. It’s not a part of
people’s lives at W&L.”’

“I would be shocked if I came across the
book in the bookstore,”’ junior dorm counselor
Heather Cooke said. ‘‘Cheating is just not a part
of the university.”’

Moore has no regrets about the book.

“I wrote it to make money,’’ Moore said.
“‘That’s the bottom line.’’

Money talks not of W&L;
Admissions says, ‘So?’

 

By MICHELLE BRIEN
Phi Staff Reponer

Washington and Lee didn’t make it onto
Money magazine’s recently released compilation
of top-ranked U.S. colleges, but Associate
Director of Admissions Julia Kozak said that
does not necessarily reflect poorly on the school.

“Different magazines use different
criteria,’ said Kozak. ‘‘They use subjective data
varying from one survey to the next. Some
surveys might compare SAT scores, others
students’ liking of their courses.’’

Kozak said she dislikes these surveys for
just those reasons.

“Prospective students read magazines
ranking the ‘best’ colleges. But for whom?
Students shouldn’t compare colleges based on
SAT scores or magazine articles,’ she said.

Kozak said she also feels that college
ranking lists are simply money makers for the

magazines. She said often college issues of
major magazines are among the largest selling
issues annually.

“‘Colleges and universities do all the work
for the magazines. Then the magazine makes all
the profit,’’ she said.

W&L’s ranking dropped seven places from
15th to 22nd place in U.S. News and World
Report's September ranking of America’s best
liberal arts colleges. However, the magazine
ranked W&L first in its best buy category.

After the drop in U.S. News, Associate
Director of Admissions Dan Murphy said that
ranking would not hurt W&L’s reputation.

“‘As long as we’re appearing in the top 25
— as one of the elite liberal arts schools in the
country — we’re in good shape,’’ Murphy said
in October.

Dean of Students David Howison agreed.

“‘The important thing is staying ‘Best
Buy,’ ’’ Howison said in October.

IU to host
Superdance
fundraiser

By ERIN MCKINNEY
Phi Staff Reporter

 

 

The Independent Union will
host a ‘‘Winter Picnic in Lex Vegas’’
fundraiser Saturday in the Warmer
Center.

The festivities will start with a
Picnic dinner at 5:30. Casino games
and live music will follow at 8 p.m.

The Boneshakers and Lost in
the Supermarket will provide the
entertaiment along with Southern
Comfort and Jubilee.

All proceeds from the event will
go toward Superdance, W&L’s
traditional Muscular Dystrophy
Association fundraiser which is
scheduled for early February.

‘“‘Any money we make after
breaking even goes to Superdance.
None of the benefits will go to IU,”’
said IU President Erica Ingersoll.

Ingersoll said she is not sure
what to expect Saturday.

“Everything is last minute for
Students here,’’ she said. ‘‘It’s hard to
plan on numbers.”’

There are a number of
volunteers who are lending their time
and talent to the cause. Most of the
fraternities and sororities will be
represented, ‘‘which is nice to see,”’
said Ingersoll.

“I just came up with the idea
{of a picnic]. I thought it would be
fun,’’ she said.

 

 

New law forces change in security policy

 

By ERIKA BOLSTAD

Beginning Sept. 1, prospective
freshmen will be able to compare crime
rates at Washington and Lee to other
schools when choosing a college.

The Campus Security Act, which was
passed by Congress in November 1990,
requires any college or university receiving
federal funds to prepare an annual report
outlining the institution’s goals for crime
prevention and reporting statistics on
several specific campus crimes.

campus,’’ Dean of Students David L.
Howison said.

The law is intended to make college
campuses safer, Howison said. Eventually,
the crime statistics gathered by the U.S.
Department of Education will be another
criteria for prospective students to use
when choosing a college, he said.

The report must include statistics on
murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault,
burglary and motor vehicle _ theft.
Universities must also release information
regarding the number of arrests on campus
for liquor law violations, drug abuse
violations and weapons possessions.

To comply with this legislation, W&L

plans to publish an annual brochure with
these statistics, compiled following the FBI
Uniform Crime Report, Howison said. He
said it will include specific university
measures to prevent campus crime.

The Campus Security Act was pushed
through Congress by the parents of a
student murdered at Lehigh University in
Pennsylvania. The family sued the uni-
versity for negligence and then lobbied
Congress to make the release of campus
crime information mandatory.

W&L will not release the names
of individuals involved in campus crimes,
Howison said. He said releasing names
would violate student privacy.

on, faculty and students.

After examining the plan, the
board, along with the development
Office, determined how much money
would be needed for implementation
and the amount of time needed to
Taise that money.

Once these goals had been
established, the university embarked
on a leadership drive to give the
Campaign the needed momentum
before taking it to the general public.

“First we took our needs to
those who know us best: professors,
parents, friends, alumni and a select
list of people who we knew would
Support the campaign,’’ McMillan
Said.

Besides momentum, McMillan
said this approach will give the cam-
Paign more credibility when taken
public next month.

The largest proportion of the
$127 million, $77 million, will be
used to greatly expand the univer-
sity’s endowment.

Endowment, money held by the
university in investments, produces an
interest yield each year that is used to
support scholarships, reward profes-
sors for achievement, aid in the up-
keep of the grounds, and keep tuition

costs down.

W&L currently stands in the
lower third of the nation’s top 25
liberal arts colleges ranked by endow-
ment per student. The Capital Cam-
paign aims to raise the university
above the median.

University Treasurer Lawrence
Broomall said this disparity exists
because W&L, unlike before, can
now be rated among this group.

“If we want to compete with
institutions that have been [raising
their endowment] in a more concerted
way for a number of years, we have
a lot of catching up to do,’” Broomall
said.

About $39 million raised in the
campaign will be used to fund several
well-known projects like the Lenfest
Center, the Fraternity Renaissance
program, the Lewis Hall addition,
updating science facilities and the
proposed student center.

Included in the money already
raised are the early contributions that
paid for the construction of the re-
cently-completed Lenfest Center for
the Performing Arts.

Also included in the early con-
tributions are $5 million of the money
used to pay for Fraternity Renais-
sance. The rest of the estimated $12

Capital Campaign plans for W&L’s future

be raised from other sources.

‘‘We thought that a fairly even-
handed way of raising the money
would be to collect about half from
the alums who used and degenerated
the houses,’’ McMillan said.

While plans for the student
center have yet to take a definitive
shape, the problems with the current
science facilities have been clearly
pinpointed.

“‘Howe Hall is in a deplorable
condition and, with the advent of
computer science, we need to greatly
expand that area’s facilities,’’ Mc-
Millan said.

The university plans to spend
about $8 million on the science wing.

The other $11 million represents
five-years’-worth of contributions to
the Annual Fund, gifts from predomi-
nately parents and alumni that go into
the university’s operating budget.
This category is included as part of

Mount Vernon on Feb. 12.

Mount Vernon, George Wash-
ington’s northern Virginia home, was
chosen because of the historical con-
nection between Washington and the
university, McMillan said.

“‘Washington’s gift to Liberty
Hall Academy was the first of its
kind to the school and the very begin-
ning of American philanthropy,”’
McMillan said.

At the campaign kick-off, the
results of the leadership portion of the
campaign will be announced. From
there, the university will take the
Capital Campaign to potential contri-
butors across the nation.

“While all fundraising cam-
paigns are educated guesswork and a
leap of faith, I’m continuously opti-
mistic that we can raise the $127
million and maybe even more,”’
McMillan said.

Instead, Mish said a fiberglass

“‘Good things come to those who
wait...and we've waited a long time.’’

That’s how head coach Verne
Canfield expressed his relief after last
night’s basketball game at Lynchburg.

The Generals waited 39:58 while
Lynchburg jumped out to a 15-point
second-half lead before junior Bob
Ehret tipped in a miss at the buzzer to
give the Generals a come-from-
behind 74-72 upset win.

Ehret was forced into extended
action when sophomore _ starting
center Robert Miggins, who had 14
points and 10 rebounds in a 76-67
loss to Guilford Saturday, sprained an
ankle in practice Tuesday.

The Generals watched while
Lynchburg opened up a 12-2 lead
early and a 26-11 lead midway
through the first half. W&L chipped
away and had a chance to go into the
locker room down by just six, but
Brian Coleman made a steal and hit a
three-pointer at the buzzer to send the
Homets to the locker room up 40-29.

Lynchburg scored the first four
points of the second half to go up 44-
29 before the Generals finally began
to get back in the game.

Struggling offensively,
W&Llooked to the defense to get
them going.

 

 

 

Ehret

“We played some great team
defense in the second half,’’ said
Canfield.

W&L forced 21 turnovers for the
game and stole the ball 14 times in
erasing the lead. W&L’s two seniors,
Mark Melton and Courtney Penn, led
the defensive effort.

The duo combined to shut down
Lynchburg’s Daryle Dooms. Dooms
scored 18 points in the first half on
seven of eight shooting, but scored
just two points in the second 20
minutes.

**Mark Melton played half of the
first half with two fouls and stayed in
the game,’’ said Canfield. ‘‘He and

Wrestling grapples with lack of depth
problem due to injuries to key performers

 

By JACOB KIMBALL
Phi Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team went into its tri-match
at Davidson undermanned, but still
wrestled two tough matches.

In the first match, the Generals
used a combination of youth and
experience to take a lead over host
Davidson. After freshmen John
Cochran at 118 pounds, Adam
Williams at 134 and Beau King at
150 earned wins, senior co-captain
Peer Soderberg won at 177 to give
the Generals an 18-17 lead.

Williams and King each won
by technical falls [more than 15

 

points], and Soderberg by decision.

The four wins put W&L ina
position to win, but Davidson came
back to win the last two matches by
forfeit. W&L’s John Conkling and
Stewart Green were both unable to
wrestle due to injury and Davidson
captured a 29-18 win.

Conkling, W&L’s 190-
pounder, is out with a separated
shoulder. Green, W&L's
heavyweight, will miss the rest of
the season with a knee injury.

Head coach Gary Franke said
depth is this team’s problem.

“Our team has very little
depth,”’ he said, ‘‘so injuries severely
hamper our chances of winning,

because it is very difficult to be
successful as a team without being
represented in every class.”’

The Generals didn’t fare well
against Anderson, yet there were two
strong individual showings. Although
the team was defeated 42-9, the
bright spots were Soderberg, who
earned his second pin of the season,
and Williams, who decisioned Chad
Singleton 9-4. Both won twice and
evened their season records at 4-4,

With six of his 10 wrestlers
freshmen, Franke heads a young team
with little experience. As he waits for
Conkling to retum, the coach hopes
his team can start to show some
improvement.

The Institute for International
Sport and Merrill Lynch, Inc. & Co.
have recently announced the 1991-

92 Sports Ethics Fellows.
Washington and Lee Athletic
Director Mike Walsh was one of 23
Fellows named.

The Fellows will conduct
research and write on the

contemporary issues of ethics, fair
play and sportsmanship, with a
specific emphasis on the influential
role of the coach within today’s
athletics.

Fellow Dr. Robert Coles, a
professor at the Harvard Medical
School will spearhead this research.

Other Fellows selected by the
Institute’s Advisory Committee
include: Vince Dooley, the athletic
director at the University of Georgia
and former football coach; Sonja
Henning, a former All-American
basketball player at Stanford; Steve
Palermo, an American League
umpire who was shot while trying
to thwart a robbery last summer;
Meredith Rainey, a member of the
1988 U.S. Olympic Team and a

 

Walsh named Sports Ethics Fellow

1990 graduate of Harvard; and
Judith Sweet, athletic director at the
University of California at San
Diego and the first woman president
of the NCAA.

 

 

 

   

Walsh

This marks the second
consecutive year that the Institute
for International Sport has selected
a group of Sports Ethics Fellows
from diverse fields in the sports
world to conduct research relating
to ethics and sportsmanship.

Work done by the Ethics
Fellows will be linked to the
Institute’s second annual National

Sportsmanship Day, which will be
held on March 3, 1992. All
participants will engage in debate
and discussion with the assistance
of a ‘‘how-to’’ packet and
introductory video tape.

More than 1,600 high schools,
colleges and universities took part
in last year’s program. Well over
1,000 schools, ranging from
elementary schools to universities,
have already registered for this
year’s Day, including schools from
every state.

In an era when substance abuse
and illegal practices, both on the
college and professional level, have
proliferated in recent years.
National Sportsmanship Day is
intended to stress the importance
and long-term benefits of fair play
and good sportsmanship.

This year’s nationwide program

will again provide school
administrators, coaches, student-
athletes, parents and fans an

opportunity to discuss contemporary
issues of ethics with a view towards
establishing a _ national
consciousness of sportsmanship.

he called the time out.”’

The Generals spread the floor
and went for one shot.

‘““We went into our spread
offense where the guards are
supposed to penetrate and dish to one
of the big men,’’ said Ehret, whose
nine points and nine rebounds were
both career-highs. ‘“‘But we didn’t
start the play until nine seconds were
left.”’

Baker got the ball and took the
shot, a three-pointer, but it rimmed
out.

“I just tumed, and nobody
blocked me out,’’ said Ehret. ‘‘The
ball came right to me, and I just put
it back in. It was pretty easy,
actually.’’

Ehret also blocked three shots
and played 30 minutes, his longest
stint of the season.

Baker led W&L with 20 points.
Watkins added 14 and junior Bryan
Brading chipped in 12. W&L shot 50
percent in the second half and made
nine three pointers on the night.
Watkins made four, and Baker and
Brading made two each.

The win ended a two-game
losing skid and gave the Generals
their first Old Dominion Athletic
Conference win of the season. The
Generals are now 4-8 and 1-5 on the
season.

ODAC win

By ERIN MCKINNEY
Phi Staff Reporter

If you get knocked off the
mountain, pick yourself up and climb
back up.

After being beaten twice last
week, the Washington and Lee
women’s swimming team rebounded
in a big way, winning 116-65 over
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
rival Mary Baldwin.

After last week’s loss to
Charleston, the Generals, depleted by
sickness hung tough but lost to
Catholic 116-77.

With only eight swimmers in
action, coach Kiki Jacobs was pleased
with her team’s performance against
Catholic.

‘All of the girls swam really
well,”’ she said. ““The meet was
close, but if we were evenly matched
[in size], it would have been closer.”’

Junior Claire Dudley won the
100- and 200-yard freestyles and took
second in the 200-yard breaststroke.
Senior Jodi Herring won the 500- and
1,000-yard freestyle and was second
in the 200-yard butterfly.

Freshman Susan Fisher had her
best meet of the year, finishing
second in the 200-yard individual
medley and the 1,000-yard freestyle.

On Wednesday, the Generals
got revenge for the two losses against
Mary Baldwin.

Fisher continued her hot streak
and got two wins, She won the 50-
and 100-yard freestyles, the first and
second events of the meet, to get the
Generals off on the right track.

Dudley also won twice, winning
the 1,000-yard freestyle and the 100-
yard backstroke.

Trio leads W&L men
past Buffalo State

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE
Phi Staff Reporter

One of the most important
elements of a championship team is
the ability to rebound after a tough
defeat. The Washington and Lee
men’s swimming team showed that
kind of character this past week.

Last Saturday, the Generals
lost a heartbreaker to Catholic
University 106-91. Coach Page
Remillard thought the team should
have won.

“The times were too similar to
the last meet [Charleston]. We were
swimming against a challenging
opponent and we didn’t get the job
done,”’ said Remillard.

However, Remillard didn’t let
the loss change his outlook on the
team. ‘‘Catholic really wanted to beat
us. They did some things we save
until the championship season,”’
explained Remillard. ‘‘We don’t want
to win dual meets at the expense of
our athletes.”

Junior Andrew Pearson led the
Generals with 24 points, with another
first place finish in the 50-yard
freestyle. Freshman John Rowe
followed Pearson with 17 points and
a win in the 200-yard butterfly, while
senior Doug Brown rounded out the

double-figure scoring with 12 points.

“*We swam well,’’ said Coach
Remillard, ‘‘but our character is going
to be tested.’’

That test came Wednesday
night against Buffalo State, and the
Generals had a resounding answer to
the questions about their character.
W&L dominated the meet from start
to finish, posting a convincing 132-74
win, upping their season mark to 3-4.

The Generals’ swimmers
recorded first place finishes in 10 of
the 11 events, finishing second in the
opening race, the 400-yard medley
relay. The outcome was never in
doubt from the third race on.

Brown, Pearson and Rowe
each recorded two victories, while
freshmen Tony Diederich, Derek
DeVries and Grant Holicky all
registered one victory each. The
Generals old winners were
accompanied by three newcomers.
The Generals will need the newfound
depth ‘as the championship season
draws closer.

The Generals close out their
home season this Saturday with a
meet against Georgetown at 2 p.m.
This is the last home meet for the
Generals. After Saturday, the
Generals spend the rest of the season
on the road.

Delts dispute suspension, appeal to Wilson

 

By THOMAS EISENHAUER

due Jan. 27, but Tuesday President Wilson
granted Delt two additional weeks to prepare its

 

Delta Tau Delta
Officials say they
will appeal the chap-
ter’s five-year sus-
pension from Wash-
ington and Lee, dis-
puting the Student
Affairs Committee’s
conclusion that the

harsh for
the crime

chapter systematically destroyed its fraternity

house.

‘* “Systematic destruction’ — that’s a term
the chapter is very upset about,’’ said Delt
President Robert Wilson, who was appointed last
week, ‘‘None of the damage was planned or
premeditated; none of it was officially sanc-

tioned.”’

On Friday, SAC suspended Delt from cam-
pus for five years, pending an appeal, for van-
dalizing its house over a 10-week period. Delt
has until Feb. 10 to appeal to university Presi-
dent John D. Wilson in writing. It was originally

Job search
tougher for
‘91 grads

By LEIGH ALLEN
Phi Staff Reporter

Members of the class of '91
aren’t faring as well in the job market
as other recent graduates have, ac-
cording to a new survey from the
Career Development and Placement
Office.

According to a survey conduct-
ed by Rick Heatley, director of
CD&P, 18 percent of the members of
the class of 91 were still ‘‘seeking’’
employment six months after gradua-
tion. That’s twice as many un-
employed graduates as the three pre-
vious classes had six months after
their graduations.

Heatley said he blames the
national economy.

“The bottom really dropped out
between November and January last
year,’’ Heatley said. ‘“There was
significant reduction in recruitment
because of the recession.”’

Heatley said that although last
year was bad, W&L students still had
a higher placement rate than students
at most other colleges.

Success or failure in finding a
job depended on a student’s major,
according to the survey:
¢ 25 percent of English majors were
unemployed six months after gradua-
tion, while only 4 percent of biology
majors were without work.

History, politics, accounting and
business administration majors all had
higher unemployment rates than the
class average.

*100 percent of math and computer
science graduates were either em-
ployed or enrolled in graduate school.

Heatley encouraged students to
search for jobs outside their majors.

“Only 29 percent of the stu-
dents who accepted jobs in the busi-
ness sector were business, accounting
or economics majors,’’ he said.

 

 

ODK inducts 29

 

From the W&L News Office

 

Washington and Lee’s chapter
of Omicron Delta Kappa initiated 29
students during the university’s Foun-
der’s Day Convocation Monday and
observed the 100th birthday of its
only living founder.

Four honorary initiates, 24 un-
dergraduates and five W&L Law
School students were tapped into the
honorary frater-
nity, which
recognizes
leadership in all
areas of campus
life.

ODK was
established at
W&L by Ru-
pert Latture,
aoe te Se
along with 11 other students. Latture,
who resides in High Point, N.C.,
turned 100 years old Saturday.

University Historian Taylor
Sanders delivered a speech on ‘“The
Last Gentlemen: General Lee’s Lega-
cy and the Matter of Moral Thought-
fulness,”’ as part of the service, which
was conducted in Lee Chapel.

The four honorary _ initiates
were: Economics Professor John M.
Gunn Jr., °45; Robert C. Dyer, °35;
Giddy Erwin Dyer and Edward A.
Turville, '36.

case.

Taylor Cole, ’75, president of the Delt House
Corporation, said SAC’s sentence is too severe
considering the amount of damage the house
sustained.

“Tl thought I had a good case going in Friday
{to the SAC hearing],’’ Cole said, ‘‘and I was
completely shocked at the outcome then, given
the fact that we’re only talking about $500 worth
of damage.”’

According to pictures of the house and
interviews with Cole, Robert Wilson and How-
ison, members of the chapter broke windows,
knocked down walls, removed ceiling tiles,
disassembled lofts and destroyed a brick bar be-
fore moving out on Dec, 22.

“This was a serious violation,’’ Howison
said Friday after the hearing. ‘“This damage was
systematic and not an isolated act of violen-
cé."

Junior Rick Peltz, one of the two edi-
tors of The Ring-tum Phi, edited and added
information to a news story conceming the
suspension of Delta Tau Delta even though
he had taken part in the vandalism himself,

and had resigned from the chapter.

These facts, Peltz said, create, at the
very least, ‘‘the perception of a conflict of

interest.’’

“If I'd known how big the story was

leave of absence from the paper,’’ Peltz
said. ‘‘If something big happens in the

Several days later, Delt voted to expel
Peltz from the chapter.

McCabe said that among the reasons
for the expulsion were Peltz’s participation

Lip-synchers vie for MTV trip

Phi Staff Reporter

On Friday, air-guitar bands from around the Wash-
ington and Lee will compete for a trip to Daytona Beach,
Fla., in the 6th annual SAM’S (Students Against Multiple
Sclerosis) Lip-Sync Contest.

The purpose of the contest is to raise money for
Multiple Sclerosis in a recreational way, said Gerald
Darrell, SAM’S advisor and director of W&L Food
Services.

Videos of first- and second-place winners from
Friday’s contest will be sent to MTV to be judged along
with other acts from schools nationwide. MTV will
choose five groups to send to Daytona during MTV’s
Spring Break weekend in March where they will perform
live on MTV and be judged by call in votes.

Epsilon and Beta Theta Pi.

The contest, to be held in the pavilion, will be

des. A $3 admission charge will go to MS.

About 20 groups have registered, Patrick said.

Dean of Students David Howison
asked fraternity presidents and pledge
educators to sign an agreement deter-
ring members from hazing pledges.

In signing the contract, fraternity
officers acknowledge that if a pledge
is seriously injured in a hazing inci-
dent, the chapter will immediately be
considered for suspension by the
Student Affairs Committee.

Howison said the ‘‘anti-hazing
agreement’ requires that presidents
and educators ‘‘will attempt to
prohibit’’ systematic physical hazing
and forced drinking of alcohol.

The contract, discussed at Tues-
day’s Interfraternity Council meeting,
has not yet been signed, said Sam
Rock, junior justice and IFC presi-
dent-elect.

‘‘None [of the fraternities] have
signed it, yet,’’ Rock said. ‘‘The IFC
is still discussing the agreement with
Dean Howison.”’

The agreement also reminds the
fraternities that hazing is illegal in
Virginia and is prohibited by both the
university and the national organi-
zation of every Greek organization on
campus.

Howison said that if a serious
injury did result from a hazing inci-
dent, SAC would first determine whe-
ther or not physical or alcoholic haz-
ing was common in the fraternity.

He said that if SAC found that
such hazing was not discouraged by
the fraternity, the chapter could be
suspended or expelled.

The agreement is a way to in-
volve chapter officers in hazing pre-
vention. ‘‘It is up to students to make
this work,”’ he said.

Howison said the agreement is
the result not of a specific incident,
but of discussions with fraternity
members. He said hazing emerged as

one of the major problems facing
fraternities in talks with senior men
last spring.

But some fraternity officers said
such a contract is not necessary.

“It’s basically personal protec-
tion for the university,” Sigma Alpha
Epsilon President Gene Pride said.
“It’s so they can give us an ‘I told
you so’ if something happens.”’

With the university’s $127 million Capital
Campaign nearly ready for its February kick-off at
Mount Vernon,
three years of nationwide, high-visibility fundraising.

The Capital Campaign, an effort to raise the
money needed to expand the university’s endowment
and complete several well-known projects like the
Lenfest Center, Fraternity Renaissance and the pro-
posed student center, is the largest fundraising effort in
Washington and Lee history. Begun in July 1990, the

plans are well underway for the next

university hopes to
break the campaign’s
goal by June 1995.

The University
Development Office has
divided the Capital
Campaign into several
phases, In the nearly-
completed Leadership
Phase, big-money contri-
butors and volunteers
were asked to set an
example for others. In

February, the campaign will begin a Major Gifts phase,
taking the campaign on the road to each of the 84
alumni chapters across the country,

Once all the chapter campaigns have been com

Raising money on the road

pleted, the Capital Campaign will conclude with a
Victory Phase beginning Sept. 1994 to solicit money
from alumni and friends not yet contacted during the
heart of the campaign.

While $54 million already has been raised in
leadership gifts, Richard Sessoms, one of the cam-
paign’s organizers, hopes at least to match that number
through the chapter campaigns. By the beginning of the
Victory Phase, Sessoms estimates that only $10-15
million will be needed to break the $127 million goal.

“The goal is totally realistic,’’ Sessoms said.
“*We have a constituency that loves this university and
understands its role. Each generation is obligated to
educate the next.”’

Raising the money is a volunteer-driven effort,
said Lex McMillan III, director of university develop-
ment.

The campaign will be run nationally through a
central committee composed of the University Develop-
ment staff and members of the Board of Trustees. This
committee will be chaired by Trustee H.F, ‘‘Gerry’’
Lenfest, ’53,

‘Gerry was the obvious choice because of his
leadership example,’’ Sessoms said. ‘‘He made the lead

gift to name the Lenfest Center, and he is a man with

great love for this university. He is not merely a

figurehead, he is the true leader of the campaign.’’

The Ring-tum Phi, January 23, 1992

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Founded September 18, 1897

Conflicts hurt all
our interests

We live on a small campus, attending a small school.
Although most of us would not trade our Washington and
Lee experiences for anything, the very situation that makes
our school so wonderful can create a journalist’s nightmare.
Some members of our staff are living that nightmare right
now.

Reporting the happenings of a small school forces us
weekly to report on our friends and classmates. While we
strive to provide objectivity, accuracy and balance in the
stories we write, we also must combat our feelings for the
subjects of these same stories. And it isn’t always easy.

Our staff includes members of many of W&L’s
fraternities and sororities, as well as athletes, members of
our student government and other special interest groups.
Simply put, there’s just a great deal of overlap.

Our involvement in the newspaper, however, represents a
commitment we have made to the W&L community — to
be a trustworthy and timely source of knowledge concerning
our campus’s latest developments. Often this commitment
has been tested by the sensitivity of issues that have arisen;
sexual assaults, the possible colonization of an historically
black fraternity and now the suspension of one of the oldest
established fraternities on our campus.

To cast a blind eye on such issues and avoid the
controversy that might result from delving into them, or to
down-play an event’s importance because of the association
one or a few of the members of our staff may have with it
would be cowardly. And then you, our readers, would not
be able to respect our publication.

Recent developments have again landed us in a tight
situation. Initially, we underestimated the scope of the issues
involved as they unfolded. Also, we were unsure of how to
handle them. In the end, both our chief editors decided to
step back for time to better preserve the staff’s objectivity.

While we might have erred in judgement, we did not do
so with malicious intent. Thankfully, life goes on.

 

Hazing contract is
simply to scare

Yet again the Dean of Students has placed another
restriction on W&L’s fraternities, but finally one that the
fraternities should be able to accept.

While we recognize that pledge activities build pledge
unity, there is really no reason for fraternities to seriously
injure them. If your pledge education program includes such
extreme forms of training, may we humbly recommend that
you change it?

But Dean Howison also deserves an award for inane
contracting in this affair. It seems a tad ridiculous that you
have to tell the fraternities not to kill or maim their pledges.
We hardly think that is an intention of any pledge program.
Besides, we do not know of any fraternity on campus whose
nationals have not already outlawed such serious forms of
hazing. The contract does not give SAC any additional
powers, nor does it bind the fraternities to any new
standards. Therefore, this is simply a blatant scare tactic
against the entire Greek system.

Quote of the week

1 am not the editor of a newspaper and shall always do right
and be good, so that God will not make me one.

LET IT RIDE

By Chris Swann

 

There is a barbaric ritual pervading this
campus. Its effects are as horrific as the fact that 90
percent of the student body participates in this
bizarre act. It involves several chemical com-
pounds, bodily harm and a toilet. I’m talking about
the Palms.

What? That place with the dying palm fronds
in the comers? The pleasant smell of Lysol mixed
with beer and Alabama Slammas? The funny
machine with cheesy videos and a microphone
every Thursday night? Yeah, that place. That... bar.
Norm Peterson would run (if that’s possible) from
the hideous activities that take place in that estab-
lishment.

On your birthday, you expect a few simple
things: a cake or sugary substitute, a kiss from your
boy/girlfriend (maybe I’d say more, but it would be
rude... and I’d probably get fired) and a check from
your grandmother. You do not expect to have your
friends gather around you like a pack of crazed

So I hear Old George is held up in traffic,
or as the Phi might refer to it, political traffic.
Last week, the Phi reported that Old George
would be ready by Mock Convention, but his
return would likely be delayed until Alumni
Weekend. Your editorial stated: ‘‘But that implies
Old George is there for the alums, and he is not.
Old George represents Washington and Lee. He
is tradition.’’ Aren’t the alums a part of Washing-
ton and Lee tradition? He was there for them, and
they should be there for him. The alums should
have as much of an opportunity to participate in
the unveiling celebration as the present students.

This isn’t just a celebration to ‘‘generate
some hype.’’ Old George has been a part of the
school for 150 years and everyone associated
with Washington and Lee ought to be able to
celebrate his long-awaited return, even if it means
that the students must wait another two months.
Besides, he was originally supposed to be back
last spring!

Keith E. Grant, 94

World War did not

stop FD, football

To the Editor:

As a member of the Washington Society
and class agent for the Class of 1943, I am sent
copies of The Ring-tum Phi from time to time.
The issue of January 9, which I received yester-

day, caused mixed reactions.

I commend Mr. Kelley for his efforts to
capture the feelings on the campus after Pearl

Harbor.

Football did continue in the fall of 1942,
my senior year. Although I was born in Martins-
burg, I had never been to the state capitol of
West Virginia in Charleston until the fall of 1942
when I went there to see the annual game be-

tween W&L and West Virginia University.

I recall attending a night club where there
was sawdust on the floor the night before the
game. | was not in very good shape on the day of

cannibals, forcing various liquid concoctions down
your throat until the room begins to spin like a
roulette wheel and you place your bets for living
until tomorrow at 60-1.

And let’s look at the diverse ‘‘drinks’’ avail-
able at this den of Satan: Mind Eraser, Bloody
Mary, Gorilla Fart. Need I go on? This looks about
as much fun as a vasectomy, minus the anesthesia.

I have a proposal. We must rise in force
against this vile business. We shall band together
and burn the Palms in its own alcoholic juices. We
WILL overcome...

..Anybody own a Tetris machine? The elec-
tronic mechanism of demonic possession? I got a
computer for Christmas with Tetris on it — for free.
Sort of eerie, isn’t it? Like someone’s trying to get
everybody to play? Not Nintendo — they just have
a marketing license, and anyway, the people that
created Mario Bros. can’t be anything bad, except
maybe habitual drug users (a game where you eat
a mushroom and get bigger; eat a flower and be
able to fly? Gimme a break...) No, Tetris was
created by a Russian. And they say communism is

 

    

the game but was offered the opportunity to serve
as a spotter for the radio broadcast of the game.
West Virginia won, but I’m not sure of the score.

Also, they did continue to have dances at
W&L, although they had fewer big names. I
clearly remember the 1943 Fancy Dress Ball. The
theme was ‘‘Military Heroes,’’ appropriate for the
war...

I was editor of the 1943 Calyx, and I clearly
remember that the Army School for Special
Services arrived on the campus on Dec. 7, 1942,
one year after Pearl Harbor.

My class is busy planning a major gift to
W&L on the occasion of our 50th anniversary
reunion in May 1993. It was a pleasure for me to
read that Mr. Kelley did include in his article a
paragraph about the death of my classmate Herby
Smith. We are planning our gift as a memorial to
the 19 members of our class who gave their lives
in World War II.

Albert D, Darby Jr.

SCC member
bashes editorial

To the Editor:

I am writing in regard to the January 9
editorial ‘‘No justice in judicial hearings’’ in The
Ring-tum Phi. Once again the Phi has acted like
an insecure little child lashing out at something it
doesn’t understand. Though I can not speak for
the IFC, I have been a member of the Student
Conduct Committee for almost two years, and |
am proud of the work we have done. In your
editorial you said that the SCC punishes ‘‘possi-
bly abusive and certainly behavior that warrants
community attention.’’ The assumption that the
student body needs to know all the processes of
the SCC is idiotic. No one ‘‘needs’’ to know
about freshman dorm violations. As for exposing
more serious cases, the SCC does not believe that
humiliation should be part of the punishment. The

members of the SCC do not need an audience to
coerce their decision-making process. There is
enough pressure in punishing one’s peers without
the entire school looking over your shoulder, No
one would be helped by open trials or public
hearings. The obvious motive behind this claim

dead. Everyone who plays this game becomes
fixated on the little blocks for hours. I have a
friend who spent her entire summer as a recep-
tionist playing Tetris all the time. I know people

who would skip class for that one last block they
need to wipe out four whole lines (called a ‘‘Tet-
ris,’’ for the uninitiated). I walk the Colonnade and
try to fit blocks in-between the spaces between
buildings... a giant video-game nightmare. Every-
one in America owns or plays this game.

comes from The Ring-tum Phi’s yearn to drag a
student’s name through its front pages. The SCC
is definitely not interested in supporting the Phi’s
tabloid-like reporting.

The Phi even had the gall to claim that the
SCC ‘‘has the ability to abuse the power it has
been granted by the student body.’’ The SCC
goes through each case with detail and decides
punishments with a majority vote. In the editorial,
the Phi bases its arguments on the Bill of Rights
but seemed to overlook the 15th amendment
which allows everyone the right to vote. All of
the members of the SCC are elected by the
students. Hopefully they are elected because the
students have trust in them. If one thinks his class
officers are abusing their power, they are free to
discuss the matter with the officers or vote for
someone else at the next election. The SCC does
not claim that they are perfect, but we do our
jobs to the best of our abilities.

The Ring-tum Phi only wants open trials so
it can fill its headlines with student violators. The
charges against the Student Conduct Committee
were uncalled for. It is a shame that the Phi
continues to write about things they know noth-
ing about. I am sure any member of the SCC will
gladly try to correct the Phi’s ignorance. I hope
in the future The Ring-tum Phi will actually think
before writing.

Sincerely,
Bill Chappell, ’94
Member of the Student Conduct Committee

Stereotype hurts
victim’s message

To the Editor:

The My View entitled ‘‘Victim Recounts
Rape”’ in last week’s Phi raises a cruel stereotype
that we find offensive. The alleged victim directly
implies that because she was not “road cheese”’
she suffered more than if she had been a student
at a nearby women’s college. This attitude is
biased and ignorant. By insulting ladies who have
been respected members of W&L’s community
for many years, the author undermines the true
issue. Rape is serious regardless of where the
victim attends school.

Sincerely,
Billy Guice, Ben Brown and Justin Winslow

New colony looks to future

 

By JENNIFER MAYO
Phi Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee’s 1992
Panhellenic Rush may be officially
over, but the newest sorority that it
brought to campus is just getting
started.

Last Thursday Pi Beta Phi
pledged 72 women, making it the
fourth sorority to colonize at W&L in
the last three years. PHC President
Dale Wyatt said Chi Omega, Kappa
Alpha Theta and Kappa Kappa Gam-
ma each gained 20 new members.

‘‘We tried so hard to make this
extension successful, and it has all
paid off, finally, Wyatt said.

Pi Phi nationals and consul-
tants said they are proud of their
numbers.

“This rush far exceeded our
expectations,” said Kelle Caldwell, a
Pi Beta Phi graduate consultant for
the new colony. ‘‘It makes every-
thing seem more real. Now we are
here to stay.’’

Caldwell is one of two gradu-
ate consultants living in Lexington to
aid and educate the colony during its
pledgeship. She and Denise Reed are
running weekly pledge meetings.

Contrary to popular belief, stu-
dents interested in establishing a his-
torically black sorority at W&L have
not given up on their efforts.

Junior Rita Poindexter, who is
also president of the Minority Stu-
dents Association, said that the wom-
en interested in joining Delta Sigma
Theta, are ‘‘continually exploring all
possible opportunities.

“The students involved are just
as dedicated as ever, but due to the
amount of time involved... interests in
the group have diversified,’’ Poin-
dexter said.

According to senior Karen Pope,
many of the girls interested in the
colonization of the historically black
sorority, have graduated or will be
graduating this year. Students are now
considering another sorority, Alpha
Kappa Alpha, as well as Delta.

Delta Policy Specialist Barbara
Faine said students unable to pledge
at W&L have two options. Delta,
whose national office is Washington,
D.C.,, holds a regional initiation every
other year, and larger cities have a
city-wide undergraduate chapter.

But Pope said the women ‘‘have
not given up and will not give up’’
until a historically black sorority is
established at W&L, and Poindexter
agreed.

“‘We have experienced minor
setbacks but there will be a historical-
ly black greek-letter sorority on cam-
pus in the near future,’’ Poindexter
said. ‘The group is just as dedicated
to seeing a sorority here. We’re on
the onset of a movement.”’

colony, and Pi Phi will not remove
consultants from Lexington until the
chapter is well established and strong
enough to stand on its own,’’ Reed
said.

The two women said that
W&L’s colony will have a consultant
living in Lexington for at least two
years. Reed will be living in Woods
Creek until March, and Caldwell will
stay until the end of the academic
year.

Both of them agreed that the
job is exciting and said they are not
discouraged by the diversity among
the 72 women.

“It would be boring if they
were all alike,’’ Caldwell said. ‘‘We
love the diversity because it gives the
group depth.”’

Members of the colony also
expressed equal optimism for its suc-
cess.

“‘There is no problem with
unity,”” junior pledge Meredith Cook
said Wednesday. ‘‘Right now we are
getting to know each other, and every
day the optimism and enthusiasm
seems to grow.”’

Cook said that Pi Phi was
attractive to her during rush because
there is more potential for leadership.

In two weeks, the group will

 

elect officers to run the meetings, and
they are already planning their instal-
lation in late April.

Wyatt said PHC couldn’t be
happier about the fourth sorority.

“‘The extension is just what
we all needed, because now our so-
rorities will not grow to inordinate
sizes,’’ Wyatt said.

“‘Next year we will all be
getting the same number of pledges,
and in several years we might want to
extend again,’’ Wyatt said. ‘‘But let’s
not think about that just yet.’’

Students to
spend spring
in Russia

By ERIKA BOLSTAD
Phi Staff Reporter

Ten Washington and Lee students
will spend this spring term at Herzen
University in St. Petersburg, Russia.

The trip to St. Petersburg includes
day trips to famous sites such as The
Hermitage, St. Isaac’s Cathedral and the
palace of Catherine the Great, according
to a press release from W&L Assistant
Professor of Russian Zhana Dolgopolova.

On overnight trips, students may
visit Moscow, Pskov and Novgorod.

. Led by
Dolgopolova,
W&L _ students
will spend six
hours a day in
intensive Russian
studies. In addi-
tion to studying
the Russian lan-
guage, students
will participate in
seminars on Rus-
sian literature and culture.

One of the most important aspects
of the trip is the cultural experience
gained by the students, Dolgopolova said.
Student grades from the trip will be based
on language skills as well as the approach
made toward experiencing Russian cul-
ture,

W&L students will be housed in
dormitories on the Herzen University
campus. Dolgopolova said the accom-
modations are nothing like dormitories in
the United States.

For example, if the hot water isn’t
working, the students might have to visit
the public baths to get a shower or do
without one altogether, said sophomore
Alex Ruskell, who is participating in the
trip.

The food in Russia is just as unpre-
dictable, but cheap, Dolgopolova said.
Cafeteria dinners cost one ruble and res-
taurant dinners five, both less than a
dollar.

Dolgopolova warned students with
picky eating habits to be prepared.

“If cafeteria food should not please
may be bought with dollars elsewhere, or
you might bring along a peanut butter
jar,” Dolgopolova said.

“‘T guess it’s about a nickel to eat in
the Russian D-Hall, though God only
knows what you'll be eating,”’ Ruskell
said

 

  

Ruskell

Students participating in the pro-
gram must all have had at least one year
of Russian, since classes at Herzen Uni-
versity are all taught in Russian.

Play will surprise you

 

By RANDY DEVERE
Phi Staff Reporter

 

The Lenfest Center stage will be
the site of choreographed popping
toasters, dying plants and a fire, be-
ginning Feb. 7.

This ‘‘prop-show from hell,’’
director and Professor of Theatre Al
Gordon calls it, is the presentation of
the Sam Shepard play True West.

The play, Shepard’s best accord-
ing to Ryan Kull, who plays a pro-
ducer named Saul, centers around a

pair of brothers, Austin and Lee, who
mvet at their mother’s Southern Cali-
fornia home after a long period of
Seperation. Lee, played by senior
Mason Petit, is an aspiring screen-
writer, while Austin, junior Rich Cas-
sone, is a drifter and con man.

The emotional heart of the play
is the relationship and antagonism
between the two brothers.

“The brothers really represent
two sides of one person,’’ said Gor-

 

don. ‘‘Lee is a very conservative,
conventional person, while Austin is
much more wild and unpredictable.
The conflict between them is the
conflict between security and adven-
ture in all of us.”’

Gordon said that much of the
play’s drama comes from a gradual
blurring of the distinctions separating
the brothers.

“*As the story unfolds, we see
the brothers switch places,”’ he said.
“It’s Austin who actually gets a
screenplay published, while Lee de-
cides he wants to travel around the
country like his brother.’’

While Gordon describes the
play as ‘‘realistic, with metaphysical
undertones,’’ he emphasizes that it is
far from somber.

“It’s definitly different from
most of Shepard’s work. There’s a
great deal of humor in it,’? Gordon
said. ‘“The stage really gets trashed.
There’s a lot of debris.’’

Throughout the production of

True West, there has been student
input, Gordon said.

“The idea for the play came
from Mason, because he wanted to
use it for his senior thesis,’’ Gordon
said.

The additional casting of Kull
and Cassone only eased the produc-
tion pressure.

“Since the three of them are
were already good friends, we’ve all
had a great time putting this on,”’
Gordon says.

Kull agreed, adding that there
was little problem conveying the
story’s pivotal relationship between
Austin and Lee.

“The most important part of the
play is the chemistry between the
brothers, and Mason and Rich can
certainly communicate that,’’ he said.

The play will be staged Feb. 7-
12 at 8 p.m. each day, with a 2 p.m.
performance on Sunday, Feb. 9.
Tickets are still available for the Feb,
8-12 performances.

The cast of Dracula, The Vampire Play rehearse an important moment in the play.

 

 

By JAMESON LEONARDI
Phi Staff Reporter

Three Washington and Lee freshmen have major
roles in Virginia Military Institute’s production of Dracu-
la, The Vampire Play.

W&L freshman James Durbin has the lead role of
Dracula. He said he was encouraged by friends to try out.

“‘[Freshmen] Melissa Wolf and Stefani Shepherd,
who are also in the play, encouraged me to try out,’’
Durbin said. ‘‘I really liked acting, so I gave it a shot.”’

Wolf plays the role of Lucy Seward, Dracula’s
victim, and Shepherd plays her maid Miss Wells.

“We saw the an ad in the local paper,’’ Wolf said.
“‘We thought it would be fun, so we gave it a shot.”’

Durbin said a beginning actor can get a role more
easily at VMI than at W&L.

“It’s more relaxed down at VMI,”’ Durbin said. ‘‘I
would have needed more experience before breaking into
the W&L Theater.”’

Director Joellen Bland had a small problem after

casting Durbin in the lead role.

“{Durbin’s] youth caused me to do something
different with the Dracula character,’’ Bland said. ‘‘Most
people think Dracula is old and scary. We tried to make
him younger and more romantic. We went for a more
seductive Dracula.’’

Durbin agrees with the character interpretation.

“We're trying to break the B-movie monster mold
with a younger, more cultured Dracula,’’ Durbin said.

Dracula, the Vampire Play, is based on Bram
Stoker’s famous horror novel, which was written in 1897.
Thirty years later, Hamilton Deane, the son of one of
Stoker’s childhood friends, adapted the novel for the
English stage. The play premiered in February 1927 in
London at the Little Theatre and ran for 391 performanc-
es. Today, it is considered the foundation for all vampire
plays and movies that have since followed.

The play will open on Jan. 23 and run Jan. 25, 29-
31, and Feb. 1, at 8:00 p.m. in the Scott Shipp Hall
Theatre at VMI.

For reservations, call the VMI Theatre at 464-7389.

APO completes project

 

By ERIN MCKINNEY
Phi Staff Reporter

There was no ‘‘tear night’’ for the new
members of the Alpha Phi Omega service
fraternity, but pledges were recently initiated into
the organization.

The pledge class of six, headed by Pledge
Class President Elizabeth Dettmar, was required
to conceive and plan an original service project
prior to initiation.

The class involved themselves in a local
community service project called ‘‘Safe and
Sound.”’

Safe and Sound is part of the City of
Lexington’s housing renewal program called
“*Threshold,’’ which
is funded by state and local grants.

“Threshold concentrates on remodeling or
constructing homes for those in the area with
special needs,’’ Dettmar said.

Safe and Sound was established to
accomplish ‘‘the little things,’’ such as painting
and moving furniture, she said.

Safe and Sound offered Washington and Lee
students the opportunity to work with and to
help the poor in the Lexington community.

“‘l was very happy to be able to help those
families in our community,’’ Dettmar said.

‘Safe and Sound gave us the opportunity to be

One project required the class to move loads

The class also prepared a porch to be con-
verted into a bathroom for a woman restricted to
the first floor of her house.

Campaigning ‘on the shoulders of giants

affairs until July 1990, said the alum-
ni chapters have been preparing a
long time for this campaign.

“I personally have been getting
ready for the campaign for nine years,
Strengthening the alumni organiza-
tions and building a foundation from
which to launch this campaign,’’ Ses-
soms said.

Each chapter campaign will be
led by a committee chairman respon-
sible for training a core of volunteers,
preparing a list of alumni likely to
make capital contributions and then
getting them to give to the campaign.

Campaign organizations in each
of the larger alumni chapters, such as
Washington, Richmond, Baltimore,
New York, Philadelphia, Houston and
Boston, are expected to have close to
40 volunteers on staff. But smaller
alumni chapters might only have two
or three people serving on the chap-
ter’s committee, Sessoms said.

““My job was to organize a com-
mittee of about 35 people,’’ said
Vernon Holleman, '58, chairman of
the Washington, D.C. campaign. “‘l

 

took the position because they asked
me to. Going to W&L is one of the
most important things that ever hap-
pened to me.”’

While the Washington area boasts
about 1,500 active alumni, Holleman
has prepared a list of about 125 pos-
sible major contributors.

“We want to get each of them to
match George Washington’s gift,”’
Holleman said.

Holleman will not have long to
wait before his committee goes into
active solicitation. The Washington,
D.C. drive will be the first chapter to
kick-off its efforts, just one day after
the entire Capital Campaign is an-

nounced at Mount Vernon next
month.
Washington, D.C., by far the

largest of the alummi chapters. was
chosen for its historic ties to the
university.

“It is spiritually the right place to
begin because of our namesakes,”’
Sessoms said. ‘‘Besides Mount Vern-
on, Alexandria was the boyhood
home of Robert E. Lee. Moreover,
Washington is a challenge because it
is the biggest chapter, and I like to

have a challenge up front.’’

The D.C. chapter will begin its
drive toward a goal of nearly $4 mil-
lion with a celebration at the May-
flower Hotel in downtown Washing-
ton on Feb. 14. Noted author and
Trustee Tom Wolfe, ’51, will host the
evening.

Since each alumni chapter along
the campaign trail is designed like a
mini-campaign, each will have a kick-
off event or party similar to Washing-
ton’s. Development office _ staffer

Christine Davis is in charge of plan-
ning these events.

“*The idea is to try to get as many
people as possible to come to the
city’s kick-off,’’ Davis said.

Featured in each gala will be a
12-minute video presentation fol-
lowed by a description of the Capital
Campaign.

Narrated by Journalism Professor
John Jennings, the video is a nostal-
gic look at the history and traditions
of W&L.

‘“‘The video is there to make
people feel good about Washington
and Lee,’’ Davis said. ‘“‘It has a defi-
nite purpose: to show about what is
going on at W&L today.”’

And since W&L today stands On
the Shoulders of Giants, the point of
the campaign is to insure that the
university always remains there.

“The campaign is important to
secure and strengthen the most unique
and special university in America,”
Sessoms said.

dows, walls and graffiti will only cost about
$500. He said he does not know how much
repairing the bar will cost.

Howison said SAC had two reasons for
suspending Delt rather than placing it on “‘criti-
cal probation:’’ the scope of the damage was
extensive; and during the period of the destruc-
tion, Delt was on house corporation probation
and had been given Interfraternity Council
probation that would have taken effect at the
beginning of winter term.

‘*From SAC’s perspective, after the frater-
nity was placed on probation — not by an
adversary, but by an ally [the house corp.] —
they continued to abuse the property,’’ he said.

Robert Wilson disagreed with SAC’s
ruling that the damage was systematic.

For instance, he said, Delt decided at a
chapter meeting in November that the bar would
not be destroyed. The house was damaged
‘‘randomly and by various individuals,’’ he
said.

But Howison said SAC concluded that
members had painted graffiti, broke windows

3 ae

 

and put holes in walls ‘‘over a period of time.”’

“‘We certainly believed that [the damage
to the house] involved several [members of the
chapter],’’ he said. ‘‘We believed that a climate
had been created in Delt that made vandalism
likely.’’

But suspension was unnecessary, Cole
said, because the chapter and the house corpora-
tion had responded properly to the actions of
chapter members.

““My response to what happened at the
house was in keeping with what I understood
the university wanted the house corporation’s
role to be in the Renaissance program,”’ he said.
In January, Delt was scheduled to begin renova-
tion under W&L’s $13 million Fratemity Re-
naissance program.

Robert Wilson said three members of the
chapter were disciplined for their involvement
in the vandalism. He agreed with Cole that the
damage to the house did not merit a five-year
suspension.

“I don’t believe [SAC’s decision] was fair
relative to the damage that has occurred in other
fraternity houses,’’ he said. ‘“There were far
more flagrant acts of disregard that weren’t
punished [similarly].’’

He pointed out that Sigma Phi Epsilon
was placed on critical probation in November
1990 after Peer Soderberg, then vice president
of SPE, fired a shotgun into the ceiling of the
SPE house to break up a fight between mem-
bers of Phi Gamma Delta and SPE. And in
January 1991, then SPE member Ulysses Shiu-
Ting Hui was arrested at the fraternity house for
smuggling hashish and possessing marijuana.
Although the presence of drugs in the house
violated SPE’s critical probation, SAC followed
IFC’s recommendation and did not suspend the
chapter.

Howison said Friday that he was not
ambivalent about the decision to suspend Delt.

““Every member of SAC would have voted
exactly the same way regardless of what house
this was,’’ Howison said.

If President Wilson upholds SAC’s deci-
sion, Robert Wilson said, ‘‘it’s possible’ that
Delt might attempt to exist as an unofficial
fraternity at W&L.

““We have considered that option,’’ Robert
Wilson said, ‘‘[of existing] as what Delt nation-
al would call on ‘colony status,’ having some
focus, like responsible drinking, and always

working toward one day core’ (offi-

cially).’’

Although no power structure exists to
control a chapter that has been suspended,
Howison said, the university would not accept
an unofficial chapter.

‘They would cease to exist and could not
function as an organization,’’ he said. ‘‘We
would not permit Delta Tau Delta to live in
their [present] house.”’

Kenneth File, executive vice president of
the national Delta Tau Delta, said it would be
“highly unusual”’ for the fraternity to allow the
W&L chapter to keep its charter if its appeal
failed.

“We have never recognized a chapter that
a university has ceased to recognize,”’ File said.

Although the fraternity fully supports the
appeal, File said, it would like to recolonize at
W&L if President Wilson upholds the suspen-
sion. But he echoed Robert Wilson’s sentiments
that a five-year suspension would be a ‘‘death
sentence’’ for Delt.

‘Everyone is painfully aware that the
number of men [at W&L] is declining relative
to the number of overall students,’’ File said. ‘‘I
truly believe that if we leave, the tradition of
Delta Tau Delta will not retum to W&L.”’

Editors grapple
with conflicts

Wilson also said, however, that
he personally did not believe Peltz
acted in bad faith.

Peltz said he had in fact caused
some of the damage in the house,
and that he had informed Dean of
Students David Howison.

According to Peltz, ‘‘almost
everyone in the house’’ had taken
part in the vandalism.

‘*T was unaware of the extent of
Rick’s involvement with the
incidents at Delt,’’ said the Phi’s
other Editor, senior Jason Kelley. *
don’t think our coverage of the
incidents in any way affected SAC’s
decision to suspend Delt. What we
want to do is avoid any possible
appearance that we did anything
wrong.”

According to the Phi’s News
Editor, junior Cathy Lopiccolo,
these new developments should not
be taken out of proportion.

“*We don’t think anyone

‘ involved in the story, or the student
body, were hurt in any way by our
reporting,’ she said. ‘‘Everything
was accurate, and that’s our job.”’

‘*After the first story, I did not
allow Rick to influence our Delt
stories in any way,’’ said Kelley.

According to Kelley, the Phi
often faces questions of conflict of
interest because of the smallness of
the campus.

Howison commended the Phi’s
“Special Edition,’’ which was
published Jan. 18.

“*Tom Eisenhauer [the Phi staff
member who wrote the story fea-
tured in the edition] and the rest of
the staff did an outstanding job at
presenting both sides of a difficult
issue’’ he said.

However, Howison refused to
comment on both the original story
and the story ‘‘Perkins: Delt could
be gone,’’ which appeared in the
Jan. 16 regular edition of the
newspaper.

 

 

According to Howison, the
Student Conduct Committee will
hold more disciplinary proceedings
concerning the damagé to the house.

the second half of W&L’s 71-58 win over Eastern points in the decisive second half.

Brown, W&L men
top Hoyas 119-87

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE
Phi Staff Reporter

Obscured by Doug Brown’s
last home meet and Claire Dudley’s
new school record, people might have
forgotten that the Washington and
Lee men’s swimming team routed
another tough opponent.

Brown had another three-win
meet, the fourth time he has won
three races, and the Generals
manhandled the Georgetown Hoyas,
119-87. The win evened W&L’s
season mark at 4-4.

It was the second big win in a
row for the Generals, and for coach
Page Remillard, it wasn’t an
unexpected sight.

**I wasn’t surprised at all by
either win,’’ said Remillard. ‘‘We
missed the challenge at Catholic and
lost. Afterwards, we talked about it
and the kids just decided to show
their pride on their own.’’

Like the meet against Buffalo
State, the Generals dominated from
start to finish, taking first place in
eight of the eleven events. The
biggest event was the second one, the
1000-yard freestyle, and not for the
race itself.

Brown won the race easily.
But before it, Remillard and the team
congratulated Brown on a terrific four
years at W&L, while the fans gave
him a standing ovation.

Brown was definitely moved.
He posted another three-win meet,
capturing the 1000-yard freestyle, the

 

200-yard butterfly, and the 500-yard
freestyle. Andrew Pearson took home
two victories in the 50-yard freestyle
and the 100-yard freestyle. While
John Rowe rounded out the individual
first-place finishes with victories in
the 400-yard individual medley and
the 200-yard breaststroke.

‘‘After the Catholic meet the
team had a talk,’’ said Pearson. ‘‘We
decided to work harder and it paid off
this past week.”’

Brown also sees this past week
as a prelude of things to come.

‘*After Buffalo State | thought
it was the adrenaline, but the
Georgetown meets shows that we are
where we want to be. A few more
hard workouts and then we’ll start to
get into our specific events.”’

The way the team swam their
last two races you'd think the
championships were this week. But
the Generals still have three dual
meets to go, and Remillard is looking
to those as tuneups for the
championship season.

“It would be nice to win our
last three meets,’ said Remillard.

“‘We have three tough ones,
especially the one against Mary
Washington. But I think we’re
looking good.”’

The Generals are on the road
from here on out, and their first stop
is Swarthmore this Saturday at 1 p.m.
The team is then off until the Mary
Washington meet on Feb. 8.

Physics sparks W&L win

 

By JAY PLOTKIN
Phi Sports Editor

 

What goes up must come down.

} It’s one of the basic theories of

physics.

The Washington and _ Lee
basketball team got a quick physics
lesson at halftime Tuesday night and
promptly applied that learning into a
win.

In trailing Old Dominion Athletic
Conference foe Eastern Mennonite
35-28 at halftime, the Generals
watched in awe as the Royals shot 58
percent from the floor including 100
percent from three-point land while
the Generals shot just 32 percent.

‘*We got a little disheartened that
they were so hot,’’ said W&L head
coach Verne Canfield. ‘‘We were

1 lucky to be within shouting distance
| at halftime.”

Canfield has been around long
enough, 28 years, to know the Royals
would cool off in the second half.

“‘T just reassured the guys that
their shots would start to miss and
some of ours would start to fall,’’
Canfield said. ‘‘And that’s what
happened.”’

The Generals

turned up the

Lack of numbers hurts women's
swimming against Georgetown

 

By ERIN MCKINNEY
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Despite a strong team effort, the
Washington and Lee women’s
swimming team couldn’t overcome a
numbers difference and lost to
Georgetown last week 110-93.

Junior Claire Dudley led the
Generals’ effort by setting a school
record in the 400-yard individual
medley with a time of 4:51:49.

Dudley won the 400 IM as well
as the 100-yard breaststroke and 100-
yard freestyle races.

Coach Kiki Jacobs said Dudley
wasn’t the only standout swimmer for
her Generals.

‘Most everybody had season-
best times,’’ the coach said.

Senior captain Jodi Herring

contributed two wins. She won the

   

1,650-yard freestyle and the 100-yard
butterfly.

Jacobs was also impressed with
the relay team, who came from
behind to win the last race of the
meet.

“‘They knew at that point that
we were going to lose the meet, but
they swam gutsy anyway,”’ she said.

“‘Last year, Georgetown just
killed us,’’ Jacobs said. ‘‘I think they
were really surprised with our
performance.”’

The Generals won eight of the
11 events, but Georgetown’s size
negated W&L’s wins.

“‘The only reason Georgetown
won was because they had 18
people,”’ Jacobs said. ‘‘Our swimmers
are great — it’s our size [nine
swimmers] that’s going to kill us.”’

defensive pressure, harrassing the
Royals into shooting an anemic 29
percent from the floor and eight
percent from three-point range.

Junior Bryan Watkins led the
second-half effort. Defensively, he
shut down EMC guard Rodney
Shields, who scored 15 first-half
points. Shields scored just two points
in the second half.

Offensively, Watkins hit three of
five second half shots, all three-

pointers, and scored 12 points,
including six in the run that put the
game away.

Watkins broke a 51-51 tie with
two free throws and then buried a
three-pointer to start an 11-0 run that
lasted over five minutes. Sophomore
Matt Newton added a three-pointer
during the run and scored all of his
career-high 11 points in the second
half.

Newton came into the game and
lifted W&L’s intensity level.

“Every game we stand around
and wait for someone to lead the
way,’’ Canfield said. ‘‘Matt provided
the lead Tuesday. He was the
inspiration.”’

Newton was one of four Generals
in double figures in the 71-58 win.

Watkins led the way with 21 points.
Senior Mark Melton had 13 points
and 10 rebounds. Sophomore Paul
Baker was also in double figures with
12.

The win came after the Generals,
5-9 overall and 2-6 in the ODAC,
were beaten 79-46 by Randolph-
Macon.

‘‘Macon was more motivated
than we were,’ said Canfield. ‘‘We
totally lacked intensity — hand we
will work on our intensity.”’

Newton provided enough
intensity to overcome Eastern
Mennonite. Canfield hopes the

intensity will carry over to Friday
night’s game with ODAC leader
Bridgewater, a 74-61 winner over
W&L earlier this season.

“‘What can you say about
Bridgewater?’’ said Canfield.
“They’ve got one of the two best, if
not the best, players in the league in
Todd Rush, and they have more depth
than anyone.

“We're the underdog, just like
we are in every game we play, but
we’re at home,”’ said Canfield. ‘‘We
can go for it with everything we’ve
got. If we play both halves with
intensity, then we have a chance.”’

Wrestlers earn first victory

 

By JACOB KIMBALL
Phi Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team picked up their first
win of the year in the Johns Hopkins
Tri-Match. The Generals defeated the
host team 24-19, but fell to Western
Maryland, 27-22.

The Generals started quickly
against Johns Hopkins as Eric
Shirley, who dropped down to the
118-pound weight class for the match,
recorded a 5-4 decision, and that
started W&L in the right direction.

Next up was an exciting match
in the 126-pound class. Rich Paini
found himself in a tough match, yet
produced a takedown and near fall in
the final seconds to tally a 6-4
decision.

Adam Williams showed his
consistency with another top
performance this week in his 4-1
decision, and John Cherry notched a
10-5 decision for his first win of the
season. Beau King then recorded a
pin that capped off the tremendous
start and put the high-flying Generals
up 18-0,

Head coach Gary Franke said,
“These early matches were the key
for us because we needed a solid lead
on points to endure our problems in
the two heavy divisions.”’

However, Johns Hopkins was
not daunted by the lead and began to
creep back into the match. Kevin
Batteh and Lea Ambercrombie both
battled hard, but were beaten. With
the score now at 18-10, the Generals
relied on team leader Peer Soderberg
to once again give them a
commanding lead.

Soderberg obliged quickly,
recording a near-fall in the first
period of his match. He maintained
this lead and withstood a closing
flurry by his Johns Hopkins
challenger to win a_ hard-fought
match.

After W&L forfeited the 190-
pound match, heavyweight John
Conkling, still suffering from a
shoulder injury, lost a close match.
The Generals were able to withstand
this loss and secure their first win of
the season.

Franke said of the victory, ‘‘It
was a very close match. All of the
individual matches were even, and we
managed to come out on top.’’

Against Western Maryland, the
Generals once again started out fast,
going up 6-0 on a pin by Shirley.
W&L also benefitted from decisions
by double-winners on the day
Williams, Cherry, Soderberg, and a
forfeit win for King.

The early wins gave W&L a 22-
15 lead entering the final two
matches, but with two forfeits due to
the injuries, Western Maryland was
able to steal a 27-22 victory.

The Generals will next host the
15th annual Washington and Lee
Invitational this Saturday in Warner
Center,

Despite the setback to Western
Maryland, the win over Johns
Hopkins should provide momentum
as the Generals prepare for this next
meet.

““We gained some confidence,
and now the team knows what it is
capable of doing,’’ said Franke.

PHC may
get vote
on SAC

By LEIGH ALLEN
Phi Staff Reporter

 

 

Students could have majority
voting power on the Student Affairs
Committee if the faculty approves a
proposal to give the Panhellenic
Council a vote on SAC.

Friday, SAC unanimously
adopted the proposal, which will go
to a faculty vote Monday, Dean of
Students David Howison said. The
faculty must approve the proposal by
a majority vote.

‘I’m optimistic the faculty
will be perfectly supportive of this,’’
Howison said. ‘‘It’s a logical step.”’

Five students, three staff mem-
bers and two administrators currently
sit on SAC.

A PHC representative now
attends SAC meetings but cannot
vote, outgoing PHC President Dale
Wyatt said.

The new proposal would give
students a 6-5 majority during the
committee votes, Howison said.

Kathy Jo Koberstein, a French
professor and fomer SAC member,
said SAC approved a similar proposal
8-1 two years ago, but the faculty
rejected it.

Koberstein said she was the
member of SAC who voted against
the proposal at that time and argued
against it before the faculty vote.

She said she expects the
faculty to reject the new proposal
because it would create an imbalance
between students and faculty.

She said students should not
be burdened with holding a majority
on SAC because of the sensitive
nature of the cases it hears.

SAC member and SCC Presi-
dent Chris Haley said having a
student majority on the committee is
not a concern because SAC rarely
votes along student/faculty lines.

Wyatt agreed with Haley’s
assesment.

‘In my experience, students
always act in the best interest of the
university. They don’t even really
represent their various organizations,”’
Wyatt said.

Delts fix up house,
hope for reversal

 

By THOMAS EISENHAUER
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Delta Tau Delta has cleaned up
its house and is drafting the appeal of
its five-year suspension.

Delt President Robert Wilson
said the chapter repaired some of the
damage done to the house by chapter
members before Christmas break. He
said the chapter worked on the house
last week and weekend.

He and i
Delt Vice Presi- 9
dent Pat Mc-
Cabe declined
to comment on
the nature of
the repairs.

‘ ‘ W e
would like to
wait until an Bs,

en
To es eee Robert Wilson
letting the campus know about that,”’
McCabe said.

Delt has until Feb. 10 to appeal
its five-year suspension in writing to
university President John D. Wilson.

On Jan. 17, the Student Affairs
Committee suspended Delt for five
years for the ‘“‘systematic destruc-
tion’’ of its house over a 10-week
period.

According to pictures of the
house and interviews with Delt House
Corporation President Taylor Cole,
Robert Wilson and Dean of Students
David Howison, members of the
chapter broke windows, knocked
down walls, removed ceiling tiles,
disassembled lofts and destroyed a
brick bar before moving out of the
house on Dec, 22.

 

   
   

President Wilson can reject the
appeal or send the case back to SAC
with commentary for reconsideration.
If the case were retumed to SAC,
Howison said, the committee would
do whatever is necessary to reconsid-
er the case fairly.

“The president doesn’t have the
arbitrary right to make the decision
on his own,’’ Howison said. ‘‘But
obviously SAC will listen to the
opinion of the president.”

Delt officials have disputed
SAC’s conclusion that the chapter
systematically destroyed its house.
Cole has said he estimates that fixing
the windows, walls and graffiti will
cost about $500. He has said he does
not know how much repairing the bar
will cost.

If Delt’s suspension is not re-
versed, Howison said, the chapter’s
seven pledges could try to join other
fraternities.

But pledge Doug Watson said
he will remain with the Delt group
whether or not the chapter is forced
to leave campus.

“I’m going to stay definitely in
Delta Tau Delta,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s the
only place I want to be right now.”’

Another pledge, Ray Mees, said
he would not comment on whether or
not he would stay with the house.

‘I can’t say anything right now.
I'll tell you after the decision [on the
appeal] has been made,”’ Mees said.

Watson declined to comment on
the intentions of the other pledges.

“There are certain people who
haven’t made up their minds yet,”’ he
said.

No one has depledged from the
chapter, McCabe said.

FD fireworks cut

 

By GREG PATTERSON
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Fireworks and the ‘‘playbill’’
brochure have been cut from this
year’s Fancy Dress, in part to create
a financial cushion for unexpected ex-
penses like those that left last year’s
gala in the red.

The theft of rented decorations,
at a cost of about $8,000, and unex-
pected cleanup costs were among the
reasons the 1991 event ran $6,300
over budget, according to 1992 FD
Chairman Elizabeth Vallotton.

Vallotton presented the first-
draft 1992 FD budget of $75,900 to
the Executive Committee Monday.
That budget did not include fireworks
or a brochure.

‘‘Not enough people see the
fireworks show’’ to justify the
expense, she said.

1991 FD Chairman John Flippen
said last year’s fireworks cost about
$2,000. Vallotton said the final cost

CRC examines assault jurisdiction

 

By JOSHUA MANNING
Phi Staff Reponer

 

The jurisdictions of the Confi-
dential Review Committee and the
Student Conduct Committee in sexual
assault cases were among the topics
discussed when 50 students met with
the CRC in Lee Chapel Wednesday.

Sophomore Kate Stimeling, of
the W&L Women’s Forum, talked
about the sexual harassment issue.

‘*A woman is going to be more
reluctant to bring such cases to the
Student Conduct Committee,’’
Stimeling said, especially when only
one woman currently sits on the SCC.

SCC member Rajeev Aggarwal,
’94L, defended the SCC’s ability to
hear harassment cases.

“‘While the CRC is necessary
for sexual assault cases, | think we
are sensitive enough and know
enough to judge other cases under the
harassment policy,’’ Aggarwal said.

SCC member Walter Godlewski,
’93L, called for greater cooperation
between the SCC and the CRC, rec-
ommending that a member of each
observe the other’s hearings.

‘This will deal with the whole
idea of consistency, given an obvious
overlap in jurisdiction,’’ Godlewski
said.

The CRC, which enforces uni-
versity harassment policy and deals
with ethnic, racial, religious and sex-
ual matters, is in the midst of a com-
prehensive self-study.

CRC Chairman Joan Shaughnes-

sy said the CRC’s largest task is to
increase awareness of its services.

‘“We have the responsibility for
letting the university community
know who we are and what we do,”’
Shaughnessy said. ‘‘More needs to be
done in the way of education.”

Mostly a counseling service, the
CRC itself has made only three case
decisions. Most complaints are han-
dled by the Dean of Students staff be-
fore they get to the CRC.

‘There is work to be done on
this campus to make sure that any
sexual activities between two people
are wholly voluntary,’’ Shaughnessy
said. “I’m not sure what will happen
with the committee, but there are
people out there who are hurting, and
that is the bottom line.”’

of last year’s brochure is disputed,
but it was budgeted at $1,500. Flip-
pen said it cost about $2,000.

Vallotton at first said the bro-
chure was cut because The Ring-tum
Phi’s supplement did a similar job.
She said Tuesday the FD committee
might reconsider that decision after
learning that the Phi is not planning a
regular supplement this year. But she
said Wednesday the decision not to
have a brochure will stand for now.

Phi Editor Jason Kelley said the
newspaper staff does not have time to
produce a regular FD supplement this
year because Mock Convention, FD
and exams follow so closely.

FD is expecting $79,350 in
revenue this year, Vallotton said, and
should therefore pay for itself. The
$3,450 cushion will be used for last-
minute expenses, Vallotton said.

“‘We overestimated all of our
cost to make sure we don’t have
problems,”’ she said. ‘‘I’ll die before
we go over budget.”’

EC ups
activities
fee by $15

By GREG PATTERSON
Phi Staff Reporter

 

 

The Executive Committee raised
next year’s Student Activities Fee to
$135 per person, a $15 increase.

The increase will mean an extra
$30,000 per year in the EC coffers.

Such an increase should avoid a
budget crisis like this year’s, said Bo
Russell, the EC vice president. He
said that while the EC allocated about
$222,000 this year to organizations, it
had $250,000 in requests.

Sophomore Rep. Nathan Dunn
said the increase is needed so the EC
can give more money to student
organizations.

“‘We weren’t able to give any
group as much as they needed this
year,’” Dunn said

The $15 increase was approved
after a motion for a $10 increase
failed.

Dunn proposed the motion for
$10.

**$15 is too much without hav-
ing a clear idea of what we are going
to spend it on,’’ Dunn said.

The activities fee was last raised
in 1989 by $5, according to EC Se-
nior Rep. Clayton Kennington.

According to the university
catalog, the fee is used to provide
financial support for the yearbook, the
campus newspaper, the student liter-
ary magazine, programs of the Stu-
dent Activities Board and other stu-
dent body activities.

In other business Monday, the
EC approved an $1,800 donation to
Superdance and preliminarily allotted
$220 to the women’s softball club.

Stop lying about
the honor system

In the past two weeks, the Executive Committee has found
two Washington and Lee students guilty of honor violations
for plagiarism. While we are not allowed to know anything
about the cases themselves, if the two were guilty, the EC
should be commended for enforcing the code of honor
embraced by the current generation of students.

W&L does a wonderful job handling the big three honor
sins: lying, cheating and stealing. But in the last three years,
no one has even turned in a possible honor violation that
didn’t involve one of those three oft-touted measures of honor.
EC President Giles Perkins said the committee uses the
designations lying, cheating and stealing as ‘‘a mode of
analysis,’ trying to fit possible violations into one of those
categories.

Last year the White Book Revisions Committee concluded
that originally the White Book intended lying, cheating and
stealing only as examples of dishonorable conduct. The crux
of the honor system, the committee said, is that ‘‘although
honorable conduct cannot be codified, lying, cheating and
stealing are clear examples of breaches of the honor system.”’
The committee recommended that ‘‘or act dishonorably’’ be
added to the references of lying, cheating and stealing.

The EC disagreed, and in doing so accurately reflected the
feelings of the majority of students. The EC’s excuse was that
the addition of this new language would be too widely
interpreted by students and would lead to many unnecessary
and absurd complaints. The real reason, however, is that we,
the student body, do not believe we can hold ourselves
accountable to General Lee’s standard of honor.

As bad as that sounds, the White Book itself allows us the
privilege to determine how far we are willing to extend our
code of honor. The White Book clearly defines dishonorable
conduct as that which is ‘‘considered dishonorable by the
student generation involved.’’ And we have defined it as
lying, cheating and stealing.

Unfortunately, we have not openly recognized what we
have done. We have taken the opportunities afforded us by
the White Book and narrowed the honor system to fit our
conveniences, But at the same time, we continue to proclaim
to the world that we hold ourselves to the standard once
embraced by Lee. This is hypocrisy.

If we are comfortable with how we have defined honor, we
should not be hiding what we have done. Instead, it seems we
are ashamed of our interpretation of honor.

Our hypocrisy tells us what we have done is wrong. But
more than that, we can see that our version of the honor
system has lost the very spirit embodied in Lee’s vision of
honor.

Students think of the honor system today as something to
avoid, something to fear. That is the unfortunate outcome of
our interpretation. Instead, the honor system should be
something the student body embraces daily. Lee sought a
system in which students strove to incorporate honorable
ideals into their every action, not a system under which
students were constantly looking over their shoulders in fear.

To reverse our hypocrisy and to realign ourselves with
Lee’s vision, we should extend the parameters of our honor
system to include the dishonorable conduct we purport that it
does. Certainly, an ‘‘or act dishonorably’’ clause would do
just that.

The current system puts
houses above students

 

My VIEW

By William C. “Burr” Datz, °75

 

Although the five-year suspension of Phi
Chapter (Delta Tau Delta) is welcomed by
some and lamented by others, my concern is
not whether or not this retributive action by
the student government is just and reasonable.
My concern is whether or not it places a
higher value on the preservation of physical
property than previous judgements handed
down, which sought to protect the physical
health of individual lives.

In our recent past, individuals’ lives have
been placed in great risk by behavior at least
indirectly associated with Greek life. For
example, there was a shotgun blast inside an
occupied house, there have been annual
hospitalizations during Tear Night, four re-
ported cases of sexual assault during last
fall’s Rush and a hit and run accident at 2
a.m., resulting in the death of a freshman in
March 1989. In most of these cases, the
individuals responsible were held accountable
for their transgressions and received an assort-
ment of social and conduct probations. Frater-
nity chapters were not held accountable for
individual behavior in these cases.

Last year, three individuals engaged in an
evening ‘‘scudweiser’’ bottle throwing exer-
cise, destroying windowpanes and endanger-
ing the safety of a sleeping housemother,
When the student government agencies did
not take immediate action to reprimand and
punish these students, President Wilson sus-
pended them for the remainder of winter term.
That action resulted in some student unrest,
and angry voices of protest rang out in Lee
Chapel and on the pages of the Spectator.
Since this wanton destruction of property
threatened the overall success of the Renais-
sance Program, these suspensions were
deemed appropriate by the powers that govern

‘Cheating 101’

To the Editor:

this university and by a general cross-section
of the student body.

In this recent Delt incident, it appears that
individuals are again responsible for approxi-
mately $500 of damage to the property, based
in reports in The Ring-tum Phi. This time, the
Chapter received the suspension.

I’m not denying the troubled nature of Phi
Chapter — as an active member in the early
‘70s and Chapter advisor in the mid-’80s, |
am well aware of the many difficulties sur-
rounding its history. But there are two issues
involved: (1) When does improper behavior
of individuals result in punishment for the
entire chapter? and (2) By increasing the
severity of the penalties imposed, have the
governing bodies of this university — both
student and administrative — begun placing a
higher value on the protection of their physi-
cal assets than on the protection of students?

It is simply not right to intentionally
destroy other people’s property. But it is also
wrong to destroy other people’s lives. Houses,
windows, walls and bars can all be replaced,
at great cumulative cost. Ashley Scarborough,
however, can never be replaced, and the scars
and erosion of trust left by the alleged sexual
assaults and rapes may never completely heal.
Is it the duty of fraternal organizations to
safeguard its members and prevent similar
transgressions?

The renovated houses are an important
part of beginning our Renaissance Program.
They deserve the care of all involved. But the
most important part of this, or any other
Greek system, is the people who compromise
it. When student and administrative governing
bodies zealously protect their human constitu-
ency with similar legislation and consistent
judgements which have been established as
precedents for the protection of the physical
buildings, then and only then will W&L’s
Renaissance Program have any real chance of
success.

Arias shatters
misconceptions

My VIEW

 

By Rick J. Peltz

 

The first thing that struck me about Oscar Arias
Sanchez when I found him looking at a display case in the
library was that he is not very tall.

I held the mistaken stereotype that a man of his
renown, about whom tall tales are told, would in fact be
tall. It was just one of the misconceptions I had of him that
were dispelled after an hour.

He is soft-spoken in both Spanish and English. He’ll
speak whichever you prefer, unless he needs an expression
that does not translate.

He did not seize the ends of my questions with
zealous, rehearsed answers like many politicians of our day
might. He takes his time. He answers a question as fully
as he believes it needs to be answered, sometimes with
several minutes of monologue and sometimes in a word or
two. Often he sits in content silence until he can choose
just the words he wants to use.

Arias was the chief

rican Peace of August

American hotbeds Peace Prize for it two

Rica is a tough peace foundation. His cur-
place to serve rent project is demilitariza-
as president. tion in Central America,

 

especially Panama. He
smiles when he talks about
his fledgling successes there, but he said the people are
listening.

He flew into Roanoke alone last week; he does not
travel with an escort. He seems to think that would be an
excessive recognition of his self-importance. Beside which,
he claims never to have had any trouble traveling alone in
Costa Rica.

Arias was president of Costa Rica, a democratic
republic with three branches of government, from 1986 to
1990. Sandwiched between Central American hotbeds
Nicaragua and Panama and stricken with the regional
problem of poor communication in rural areas, Costa Rica
is a tough place to serve as president.

But Arias believes the Costa Ricans like politics, and
he estimates that about 90 percent of those eligible to vote
do so. The presidential elections occur every four years,
and campaigning starts a good two years in advance.

Arias was not always as popular at home as he is
today. Despite the Central American Peace, a 25 percent
inflation rate in 1988 drew criticism from the Costa Rican
people and the press that Arias was too concerned with
issues abroad and not at home.

They might well have been right about their domestic
situation, though Arias produces figures to defend himself.
He insisted that at year-end 1988 things were in the process
of improving, and that they did improve. By the end of his
term, he said inflation had dropped to under ,10 percent.

Arias is regarded negatively from the popular First
World perspective as a leader in the Third World's eco-
nomic cry (perhaps whine) for help from United Nations
agencies. He is a critic of the ‘‘wealthy North.’’

He seems reluctant to criticize Costa Rica’s current
government, but he admits he doesn’t approve of the
opposition party’s president. He thinks the national econo-
my is again faltering and that the president does not know
how to handle it.

He shakes his head with regret when he says he
cannot again run for president due to a constitutional man-
date limiting heads of state to one term per lifetime.

But Arias is proud of Costa Rica and proud of the
freedom afforded the people there. He seems to want for-
eigners to know it is ‘‘the most open’’ nation in Latin
America.

He also wants us to come to Costa Rica, not just to
visit the tourist attractions but to see the poor areas, too. He
seems to think that everyone in the First World could learn
something from visiting the Third.

Come in the spring, he recommends, and bring an
umbrella for the rainy season. The tourist traffic is minimal
then.

If your timing is right, Arias said you might get to see
how well his wife is doing in the presidential primaries.

Rick J. Peltz, a junior, is an editor of The Ring-tum
Phi and co-recipient of the 1992 Todd C. Smith Memorial
Fellowship. This spring, he will travel to Costa Rica to
study the state of free press in that nation.

World leaders differ on national defense

Thatcher
Says, ‘be

By RICK PELTZ
Phi Editor

 

 

A sustained strong defense in
the First World and the reconciliation
of political and military decisions
were the themes of former British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s
address at Virginia Military Institute
Friday.

“The unexpected won’t stop
happening,’’ she said. ‘Tyrants will
not stop being born.”’

Thatcher gave a chronology of
crises she faced during her term in
office, all of which she said were
unexpected. She started with the 1979
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and
ended with the Iraqi invasion of Ku-
wait, along the way covering the war
between Great Britain and Argentina
over the Falkland Islands.

In each emergency, Thatcher
said NATO’s readiness allowed West-
em military forces to mobilize quick-
ly.

“In no stage in that 11 to 12
year period could we have defended
liberty... unless we had made the right
decisions in defense,’’ she said. ‘“The
assurance that liberty will triumph is
to retain your defense in peak condi-
uion.”’

Thatcher stressed the importance
of mutual understanding between
political and military forces.

chiefs met together every Sunday.

The military ‘‘should never be
wanting a political decision as to
what their objective is,’’ she said.

‘‘When the objective is to re-
cover the liberty of the people, that is
your first objective.”’

Thatcher also praised the way
Western nations countered commu-
nism during her term. She lauded
NATO’s containment policy as well

 

   

 

as Western propaganda machines like
Radio Liberty.

“We took our technology
ahead,”’ she said, ‘‘and this was say-
ing, ‘We will not tolerate the exten-
sion of your wicked creed. You might
as well drop it.” ’’

She also praised former Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev as a
visionary in the Soviet Union, saying
she helped show him the merits of a

free society when he visited Britain.

Thatcher said, given the rapid
breakup of the Soviet Union and the
uneasy alliance that has replaced it,
looking ahead can be frightening.

She said not to worry, though,
as things worked out all right after
another great empire once crumbled
— the British Empire.

“And that would’ve been han-
dled better if I’d been there.”’

Arias calls on First World
to ease debt, demilitarize

 

By RICK PELTZ
Phi Editor

 

The time has come for the First
World to face the Third, according to
Nobel Peace Prize winner Oscar
Arias, who spoke at Lee Chapel on
Jan. 23.

‘For nearly 40 years the world
endured a confrontation of two mili-

tary blocks ‘with*an insafiely déstruc-’'’

‘tive capacity,”’ Arids'said. ‘‘[By con-
centrating on the Cold War,] the pow-
ers of the North have postponed the
solution of humanity’s problems.”’

Arias, former president of Costa
Rica, won the Nobel Prize in 1987
for his Central American Peace plan.

He said that since the Cold War
is over, world leaders’ next priority
should be the Third World.

“‘No nation can advance solu-
tions to contemporary problems until
the problems in the Third World are
resolved,’’ he said.

“Since 1982, Third World gov-
ernments have encountered crises that
have impeded them ... from a reason-
able level of human development in
the foreseeable future. Banks are
more concerned with collecting debts
than human development.”

Arias cited debt, drugs, poverty
and deforestation as the most impor-

tant Third World problems to be
solved. They are all related, he said.
Thousands of people dedicate
their lives to drug production because
it is so profitable and gives them eco-
nomic power, their best weapon
against poverty, he said. Natural
resources such as forests are thus
destroyed to make more room for
drug production.
“He said the Third World nations

cannot break this cycle because they '

spend their resources servicing debt.

“The ball is in the court of the
industrialized nations,’’ Arias said.
“We [in the Third World] no longer
talk about external but eternal debt.’’

Arias also said armed conflict
must be eradicated from the Third
World. He said the five permanent
member nations of the United Nations
Security Council supply 85 percent of
the world’s arms, and thus must take
the lead in global demilitarization.

Arias pointed to Costa Rica,
which does not have an army, as an
example of successful demilitariza-
tion.

‘| don’t see any need for a
small country like ... Guatemala to
have an army of 60,000 men,”’ he
said. ‘‘Costa Rica ... has been the
only country ... with the courage to
declare peace to the world.”’

Coeducation in Retrospect

The Ring-tum Phi, January 30, 1992

 

 

100 year debate preceded the school’s ‘big leap

 

By JOYCE BAUTISTA
Phi Staff Reporter

 

“You calic men will say that life will be too prosy
without flirtation, — if girls get serious, and that boys
will be boys and girls will be girls. We doubt if life
should be any less poetic if you should understand the
real poetry of life; ... And you need never fear that boys
will be girls and girls will be boys under co-education"’

--The Ring-tum Phi, March 1, 1902

The debate over whether to admit women to
Washington and Lee goes back much further than its in-
ception in the fall of 1985.

The earliest co-education debate on record in-
volved the faculty and Board of Trustees in the spring of
1896. The reason for the debate was a drastic drop in
student enrollment in 1895, which may be seen as an
event to foreshadow later discussions involving the same
dilemma of enrollment from the late 1960s to the early
1980s.

The final faculty vote in 1896 was three ayes and
, seven nays. According to Ollinger Crenshaw’s General
oo a Lee's College, the reverend trustee, Dr. E.C. Gordon,
a =e" Fa | moved on June 17, 1896, for the appointment of a board

: elf committee to inquire into the expediency of ‘‘opening the
aut rae eae eee doors of this University” to women. Yet, the next day the
resolution was voted on and not discussed again until

1902.

‘‘Shall we perpetuate the old prejudice which has
existed for ages, and has only succumbed to some extent
to the liberalism of the twentieth century? Shall we resign
our place as the most progressive institution in the South,
as the leader in the march of civilization, as well as in
scholarship?’’ The Southern Collegian was on top of the
co-education issue. In 1902 the publication declared that
the ‘‘big’’ question, the ‘‘burning’’ issue of the day was
admitting women at Washington and Lee. A faculty com-
mittee was again put to work investigating the feasibility
of coeducation and, according to Crenshaw, stated that if
the committee report should be favorable, the faculty
would recommend coeducation to the trustee’s meeting in
June.

The Ring-tum Phi was also in support of admitting
women to W&L, yet again the issue was dealt a heavy
handed defeat. One student wrote to the Phi urging Wash-
ington and Lee to ‘‘resist the ‘New Woman,’ who was far
too ‘strenuous’ for the young man’s taste.”’

Except for the admission of women students during
the wartime summers of 1942-1944, when the university
was practically devoid of male students, and in 1969 and

eralism that began sweeping the country in the late 1960s.

In 1970, women began to take undergraduate
courses through an exchange program with area colleges.

In 1972, the Law School admitted women, bowing §
to pressure from the American Bar Association, who
would not continue to accredit schools and colleges not
open to talent regardless of race, religion, or sex.

“I guess I should not have been surprised to have
it [coeducation] become the focal point of my first 10
months in office — though clearly I was surprised,”’
University President John Wilson said in 1983 in his,
“Reflections on the Question of Undergraduate Coeduca-
tion at Washington and Lee.”’

According to an Oct. 1984 Newsweek article Presi-
dent Wilson had come from all-female Wells College,
where he had supported single-sex education. Wilson cited
the fact that an increasing number of qualified applicants
had decided not to go to W&L because it was all-male.

According to Professor of History and University
Historian Taylor Sanders, single-sex Washington and Lee
was once the norm, along with such prestigous univer
sities as Harvard, Princeton, and Vassar. After they and
many other universities and colleges across the nation
decided to admit women, W&L became isolated. Single-
sex schools were no longer the norm, but an oddity.

**Coeducation has been the essential factor in
making Princeton the most attractive place in the country,
not only for students but for faculty...’’ Princeton’s Pro-
fessor Albert Sonnenfeld said shortly after Princeton’s Lem Tucker of CBS News interviewed President
admission of women. Wilson about coeducation in 1983.

The steady drop in student enrollment seemed to
also support the reasoning that single-sex universities were
no longer attractive to potential college students.

‘*In short we are not dealing with a fad but with a
significant permanent change in American Society,”

President Wilson said in his 1983 report. E

In 1983, W&L accepted
slightly over half of it’s appli-
cants, according to the co-edu-
cation report. Expectations were
that enrollment would drop 25 i
percent all across the nation in sity N
the next year, forcing the uni-
versity to lower admission stan-
dards to keep enrollment of the
freshman class steady.

Supporters of coeduca- t.
tion believed that the addition
of women students in the class-
room would produce higher
quality work, because the report
assumed that at 18 women are

assumed that at 18 women are more mature than men.
Faculty also said a valuable point of view would be
gained by the continuous presence of women in class
discussion.

Opponents of coeducation cited what they called,
“doctrine of distraction,’’ causing nervousness between
the sexes that could affect academic performance.

Associate Professor of Sociology David Novak
released a report of the poll results conducted by students
in the department entitled ‘‘Coeducation at Washington
and Lee University: Student and Faculty Perspectives.”’

The results of the 1984 survey revealed that 42.4
percent of the student body polled believed that W&L
should go co-ed and 52.9 percent should not. A total of
1,084 students, or 84 percent participated in the survey.

Among the faculty the results were much more lop-
sided in favor of coeducation. Of those faculty members
polled, 82.3 percent believed that W&L should admit
women and 14.3 percent opposed admission of women. A
total of 120 faculty members, or 84 percent participated in
the survey.

Both groups surveyed, according to the 1984 report,
were concerned with ‘‘potential loss of tradition and dis-
tinctiveness coupled with cost of converting to coedu-
cation.”’

In 1984, after 235 years of only admitting men,
W&L’s Board of Trustees voted 17 to 7 to admit women
in the fall of 1985.

‘*An all-male school doesn’t seem to be a product that

sells,’’ Board Chairman James Ballengee said to News-

week in 1984.

In 1985, W&L admitted 107 women as part of the 423 [-

member class of ‘89. The campus swarmed with reporters

to record the memorable moment of Washington and Lee | 4

University history that ended 235 years of single-sex ad-
mission.

But, there were still those who strongly opposed |

coeducation.

“‘The education of women is a trivial matter,’’ one
veteran professor told a Newsweek reporter. ‘‘The edu-
cation of men is a serious matter. I don’t think the frivo-
lous and serious should mix.”’

Jon Missert, a graduate of the last all-male class, 1988,
noted that he along with most of his class were initially
opposed to coeducation.

‘“Many of the alumni felt that the issue was railroaded
through the Board of Trustees,’’ Missert said. ‘“The deci-

sion wasn’t made in a good way. It seemed they voted |;

when school was out of session to purposely avoid student
protest.’’

Though initially opposed to coeducation, Missert along
with a majority of his class had learned to accept the new
women on the Hill as fellow W&L students.

“‘W&L being a single-sex school fostered dealing with
women on a strictly social level only,’’ Missert said.
“‘Women should be dealt with on an academic level, not
' just as girls coming down the road.”’

 

Though Missert said it felt good to graduate from a
university that had higher academic standards than before
coeducation, he believes that W&L did not need to admit
women because of the falling student enrollment. Instead,
he blames poor recruiting not the W&L’s supposed loss
of appeal to perspective freshmen.

“‘If they really wanted more and better applicants,’’ he
said, ‘‘they could have gotten them.’’

The notion that there were some professors still
strongly opposed to admitting women after coeducation,
Missert said, was not their opposition of female W&L
students but the fear of losing tradition.

However, by 1988 women had their own social
organizations and sports. Women had been elected to the
Executive Committee and held offices in class government
and positions in the school newspaper and other groups.

The adjustment had been awkward for the first class
of women, Professor Sanders said, but conditions for
women have greatly improved. The colonization of
sororities and the availability of support groups for women
are firm pillars of support for the growing female popula-
tion.

Sanders, a professor at W&L since 1969, was one of
the 90 percent of the faculty that finally agreed on
coeducation. He feels that the first few classes of grad-
uating women had it the worst but noticed that their
outlook on life was more optimistic, toughened by a male-
dominated social and academic environment.

‘In order to survive here,’’ he said, ‘‘a kid has to be
tough. That’s the way it always has been.”’

Speaker addresses disorders

 

By MAUREEN LEVEY
Phi Staff Reponer

 

Studies show one in four col-
lege women in the United States
suffers from an eating disorder, and
the figures are not much different at
Washington and Lee. In fact, they
might be higher.

Marlene Boskind-White, a
national authority on eating disorders,
will talk to a W&L audience in
Northen Auditorium tonight about
““bulimarexia,’’ a combination of
anorexia and bulimia, which are char-
acterized starvation and binging and
purging.

According to studies Boskind-
White began at Cornell University in
the mid 1970s, many driven young
women can develop the compulsive
behavioral disorders as a way of
coping with other pressures.

They lose or control their
weight through unhealthy methods
like starvation, binging and purging,
abuse of laxatives or diuretics, and
compulsive exercise.

“*High achieving women, like
those at W&L, find themselves often
with a problem [with eating],’’ said
Associate Dean of Students and
Counseling Psychologist Anne Schro-
er-Lamont. ‘‘Achievers strive for
perfectionism.”’

According to Schroer-Lamont,

 

   

WT]
Boskind-White

more W&L women have come for
counseling this year for eating disor-
ders than in other years, and some
men have come as well. National
studies indicate one person in 10 with
the eating disorders is a man.

‘Even athletes have ‘bulimar-
exic’ tendencies because of their
discipline to stay in shape,’’ Schroer-
Lamont said, ‘‘especially male wres-
tlers who have strict weight guide-
lines.’’

Schroer-Lamont added that
one-third of women nationally with
eating disorders have also been sexu-
ally assaulted or raped.

Bulimarexia is the most com-
mon form of eating disorders, accord-
ing to Schroer-Lamont. She said some
anorexics lose up to 30 percent of

their body weight, cease to menstru-
ate, suffer anemia and even die. Buli-
mics usually remain closer to a nor-
mal body size, but may develop dys-
rhythmia or a ruptured esophagus
among other problems.

‘I’m not sure people engaged
in such behaviors are even aware of
their condition,’’ she said. ‘‘Many are
striving to be perfect. That can trigger
it.”” The Health Education Com-
mittee invited Boskind-White, who is
a professional counselor in Roanoke,
Va. Her staff includes a nutritionist
and an exercise physiologist.

Schroer-Lamont said Boskind-
White has treated thousands of wom-
en, some from as far away as Canada
and Europe, with eating disorders.

Boskind-White is presently a
consultant to the National Collegiate
Athletic Association. She is also a
senior consultant at St. Albans Psy-
chiatric Hospital in Radford, Va., and
serves as adjunct associate professor
at Virginia Tech.

She and her husband William
C. White, Jr. have authored numerous
publications, including the best selling
book Bulimarexia: The Binge/Purge
Cycle, and articles in national maga-
zines on eating disorders.

Who is more competent to lead
the United States, the Democrats or
Republicans?

The College Democrats and
College Republicans will sponsor a
debate to answer that question on
Feb. 4 at 7:30 p.m. in Commerce
School Room 227.

College Democrats President
Matt Jackson said debate is not meant
to be competitive but educational.

“It’s something that has never
been done before, the bringing togeth-

discuss issues,’’ Jackson said. ‘‘We
can leam a lot from each other by
debating the issues.”’

Jackson said he sees some of
the debate focusing on the Democrat-
ic plans to reclaim the middle class
and on their view of the Gulf War.

“The hypocrisy of foreign af-
fairs will also be an issue,’’ Jackson
said. ‘‘The Gulf War started out as a
war for jobs and oil and ended up as
an ideological war.”’

Amanda Stewart, chairman of
the College Republicans, agrees with
Jackson’s opinion as to the reasons
for the debate.

But Stewart said economic and

Stewart said. ‘‘We want more choices

A new recycling program is being planned for
Washington and Lee and Virginia Military Institute in co-
operation with the city of Lexington, and some of the re-
sults can already be seen on campus.

At present, recycling receptacles for mixed paper and
cardboard are found throughout W&L’s undergraduate
campus. According to Buildings and Grounds Superin-
tendent James Arthur, mixed paper bins will soon be at
the law school, as well.

Collections from these bins are taken to the larger
recycling collection center, located next to the Kroger gro-
cery store on Rt. 11. Drop-off centers and storage spaces
may eventually exist in Augusta County and areas north
of Rockbridge County, as well.

Lexington City Manager Jon Ellestad said he hopes to

will also be emphasized because it is very cost effective,
according to Ellestad.

‘The city is under a mandate. Ten percent of its land-
fill tonnage must be recycled,’’ said Arthur.

Curbside collection of recyclable materials and the
addition of a county landfill for bailed paper and card-
board should increase the percentage of used items that
are recycled.

Ellestad said Lexington already may be ahead of its
goal because summary figures for 1991 indicate 13 per-
cent of the city’s total waste stream was recycled.

Ellestad added that the city will still need federal
funding to help it buy a place for the landfill and market
the project.

While a processing center for recyclable materials has
not been established, W&L and VMI are encouraging
students to get involved with campus recycling programs.

Women’s swimming fights flu at Swarthmore

 

By ERIN MCKINNEY
Phi Staff Reporter

 

A depleted Washington and Lee
women’s swimming team lost to
Swarthmore last Saturday, 123-72.

The team has been hit by the flu
epidemic that has swept the country
and is having trouble keeping

everyone healthy.
The lack of healthy swimmers

 

has hurt the team in the last couple of
meets.

The Generals only had seven of
their regular nine swimmers against
Swarthmore, but coach Kiki Jacobs
didn’t try to use it as an excuse for
the loss.

“I’m not certain that we would
have won if we had had all of our
swimmers,’’ said Jacobs, ‘‘but the
meet would have been much more

competitive.”

Despite the low numbers, Jacobs
was pleased with her team’s
performance.

“Considering the long road trip
we made, we swam really well,’’
Jacobs said.

Senior Jodi Herring led the
W&L effort. She took first place in
the 1000-yard freestyle and the 500-
yard freestyle, plus second in the 200-

yard butterfly.

Junior Claire Dudley had yet
another strong meet. She captured
first place in the 100-yard freestyle
and took second in the 200-yard
freestyle and the 200-yard breastroke.

Freshman Susan Fisher also had
a very good meet. She won the 100-
yard backstroke and claimed second
in the 200-yard individual medley.

ODAC’s top three teams
top struggling Generals

 

By JAY PLOTKIN
Phi Sports Editor

ESPN college basketball analyst
Dick Vitale came to Lexington on
Wednesday and brought his sense of
the big-time with him.

The Washington and Lee
basketball team has gotten a good
look at the big time of the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference this
past week, and the Generals found the
going rough.

The league’s top three teams,
Bridgewater, Emory and Henry and
Hampden-Sydney ll sent the
Generals home empty-handed and
dropped W&L’s record to 5-12 and 2-
9,

 

But the losses weren’t all bad,
said head coach Verne Canfield.

“I just wish we could put two
halves together,’’ he said. ‘‘We’ll
play one good half and then have a
lapse that takes us out of the game.’’

Against Bridgewater Friday
night, the Generals trailed by 11 at
the half, but rallied to cut the lead to
six before finally falling 78-71. At
E&H on Monday, W&L trailed 35-31
at the half but went cold in the
second half and lost 83-69. And last
night at the Warner Center, the
Generals trailed just 36-30 to start the
second half, but again went cold, and

H-SC went on to an 84-63 win.

“‘We can play with anybody,”’
said Canfield. ‘‘But we think about
playing with the top teams too much
and that causes the lapses.’’

Against the Tigers, senior Mark
Melton and sophomore Robert
Miggins scored to start the second
half, but Russell Turner led an 11-2
H-SC run that opened up a 47-32
lead.

After W&L cut the lead back to
10 at 59-49, the Tigers sent on an 8-2
run to ice the game.

Freshman John Rogers provided
the highlight of the second half with
his breakaway dunk at the final
buzzer. Rogers led W&L with a
career-high 14 points. Junior Bryan
Watkins, the team’s leading scorer on
the season, scored 12 points, 11 in the
second half.

Watkins scored 23 points in the
loss to Bridgewater and 19 in the loss
at Emory and Henry.

Despite the losses, Canfield is
pleased with the effort his team has
put out.

“We are going through an on-
going learning process, and I’m
pleased we’ve maintained our work
ethic,’’ he said. ‘‘We haven’t quit or
given up. We’re still working hard to
improve.”’

Jacobs is optimistic about the
team’s upcoming schedule although
she admits that it will be tough.

“Trying to keep everybody
healthy is the key,’’ Jacobs said.

The Generals next meet is
against Bridgewater this Saturday at
10 a.m. in Twombly Pool.

The Generals are also starting to
look ahead to the Old Dominion
Athleitic Conference Championships

beginning Feb. 21.
“*Soon we’ ll be concentrating on
resting for ODACs,’’ Jacobs said.

This year’s women’s team will
be the smallest one to ever compete
in the championships.

“Tt will be a good win if we
can pull it off,’’ said Jacobs.

Vitale calls a
T.O. at W&L

By STEVE FUGITTE
Phi Staff Reporter

 

 

Dick Vitale had a capacity crowd
at Washington and Lee’s Warner
Center gasping for breath Wednesday
night.

ESPN’s top college basketball
analyst spoke on topics ranging from
hoops to happiness in his usual
machine gun style.

Vitale is speaking in support of
his new book, Time Out, Baby. The
book recounts the 1990-1991
basketball season from  Vitale’s
unique perspective.

Used to crowds upwards of
22,500 in the Rupp Arena and Smith
Centers of America, W&L’s Warner
Center was a change of venue for the
analyst who usually attends the
biggest games in the country.

Although not the big-time, Vitale
had nothing but good things to say
about Generals’ basketball.

“‘They don’t have a lot of size or
bulk, but they got heart, baby,”’
Vitale said after viewing W&L’s 21-
point loss to Hampden-Sydney.

Vitale admitted being in W&L’s
high school-sized gym brought back
memories of coaching high school

boost to his team’s confidence.

““We have a young team and
they’re beginning to catch up,’’ said
Remillard. ‘“They now know they can
win on the road, and that’s going to
be a big help the rest of the way.’’

The young members of the
team stepped up again at Swarthmore.
Freshman Roland Chase won the 100-

yard freestyle, classmate Grant
Holicky won the 200-yard
breaststroke, and rounding out the trio
of first-year swimmers, Tony
Diederich won the 200-yard
backstroke.

However, W&L’s more

experienced trio wasn’t to be outdone.

Men’s swimming wins big, again

Pearson and freshman John Rowe
have been the team’s most consistent
swimmers all year.

Brown picked up two more

freestyle and the 500-yard freestyle,
Pearson won the 50-yard freestyle,
and Rowe continued his impressive
season with victories in the 200-yard
izm, and the 200-yard butterfly.

W&L won’t swim again until
Feb. 8 at Mary Washington. While
the team will maintain its practice

schedule, not having a meet for a

while is a welcome break for the
swimmers.
‘It’s nice to have a weekend

Senior Peer Soderberg gains the upper hand on an co-captain won twice en route to a second- -place
opponent in Saturday's W&L Invitational. W&L’s finish in the 177-pound weight class.

Soderberg places second in Invitational

 

By JACOB KIMBALL
Phi Staff Reporter

In the 15th annual Washington
and Lee Invitational, the Generals as
a team had an off day, but co-captain
Peer Soderberg continued to wrestle
impressively.

Longwood captured the team
championship with 81 points, La
Salle’s  Vinne Ermst was the
tournament’s Outstanding Wrestler,
and Soderberg was by far W&L’s
best wrestler.

Soderberg extending his match
winning streak to six by handily
defeating his first two opponents,

In the first round, Soderberg
opened a 14-0 lead against Daniel
Roadcap of Newport News
Apprentice before pinning him. He

 

: shut out Bryan Hartley of Longwood

in the second round to earn a shot at
the 177-pound championship,
something he desparately wanted.

“I came close in the three
previous years, so I really wanted to
win it,’’ said Soderberg.

Soderberg’s obstacle to the
championship was NNA fifth-year
senior Art Whitaker. Soderberg was
shaken by his more experienced
opponent.

“I was not intimidated by him
because we were physically even,”’
he said. ‘‘But, even though we were
equal in terms of strength, his
experience gave him the edge.’’

Whitaker defeated Soderberg
and ended his six-match winning
streak.

Despite the defeat, Soderberg
has been content with his
performance of late.

From The Associated Press

 

LIMA, Peru — More details have been
reported in the murder of journalist Todd C.
Smith, ’83, who was tortured and killed in
Peru in 1989 while investigating drug trading.

According to the daily newspaper Ulti-
ma Hora, Smith had discovered a drug pro-
cessing laboratory and learned when a ship-
ment of coca paste was leaving an airport in

Peru’s jungle.

northeast of Lima.

Ultima Hora claimed to have identified
Smith’s murderers. Smith was found tortured
to death in November 1989 near Uchiza, Peru
in the Upper Huallaga Valley, some 250 miles

The 28-year-old Tampa Tribune reporter
had come to Peru on a working vacation to
look into drug trade in the valley, the source
of about a third of the world’s coca leaf. The
leaf is processed into a paste and shipped to
Colombia to be refined into cocaine.

a $30,000 bounty.

But Ultima Hora said the Shining Path
had nothing to do with Smith’s death and that
he was killed for information he had uncov-
ered about the drug trade.

The newspaper said Saturday that Smith
had unwittingly flown to Uchiza with an air-
taxi company owned by a man suspected of

had discovered a lab belonging to other drug
traffickers as well as their plans for an up-
coming shipment.

Ultima Hora said Smith was waiting for
his flight out of Uchiza when he was abduc-
ted by armed men. The paper said he died
after three days of torture in a hotel owned by
the traffickers.

EC President Giles Perkins moderates Tuesday's debate between the College Republicans and the College Democrats.

 

GOP, Dems debate which party should lead

 

By ALISHA JOHNSON
Phi Staff Reporter

 

College Republicans and College Democrats
clashed Tuesday in a debate over which party is
most competent to lead the United States in foreign
and domestic affairs.

Sophomore MacGregor Tisdale defended
President George Bush’s past record in foreign
policy, noting what he called successes, like the
liberation of Kuwait, the removal of drug lord
Manuel Noriega from power in Panama, the remov-
al of the Berlin Wall, and the move of eastern bloc
countries toward new. systems.of government.

But the Democrats held that, despite Bush’s
accomplishments, the president’s views have
shifted to match public opinion.

“The problem with Bush is that he presents
himself as one for human rights, economic well-be-

ing and making the world safe for democracy,”’
sophomore Ben Eggleston said.

“Then he backs down for the sake of eco-
nomics and expediency.”’

Eggleston criticized the Republican’s handling
of the Gulf War and quoted Secretary of State
James Baker, who he said called the Gulf War
“*fundamentally about jobs.’

Sophomore Richard Houston supported the
Republican party.

“Pragmatism is the nature of American poli-
tics,’’ Houston said. ‘‘It is unfortunate, but it is the
case, and George Bush has to work within the
parameters of that.’’ “

Houston lauded Bush, saying that ‘‘commu-
nism, as a principle, is dead in the world. We can
see now in places like North Korea and China ...
there is talk all over about a free market society.”’

Sophomore Democrat Cottie Miles opened the

discussion on domestic policies, asking the audi-
ence, ‘‘Are you any better off now than you were
in 1988?”

Miles evoked the image of an impoverished
family behind a closed curtain and maintained that
Bush has ‘‘closed the curtain on America for four
years. The curtain is bulging.... The Democrats ask
for fairness, that the rich pay their fair share of
taxes. We propose a 10 percent tax cut for the
middle class ... and reform in education.’’

Sophomore Ryan Dennard rebutted Miles’
argument. He said Democrats want to spend more
on health and education while taxes decrease.

‘*The only difference with the Republicans is
that we realize we have to pay for what we get,”’
he said. ‘“‘The idea of ‘playing now and paying
later’ is a problem. The Republicans are offering
prudent solutions to solid problems, long-term in-
vestment to long-term growth.”’

Sr. class
president
faces DUI

By JASON KELLEY
Phi Editor

 

 

Senior Class President and
Student Conduct Committee Member
Read Folline was charged with
driving under the influence early
Sunday morning.

According to police records,
Folline was arrested by Lexington
Police Officer M.J. Bennett at 2:20
a.m. after failing roadside sobriety
checks.

Folline said while he made a
mistake, he feels his ability to judge

cases on the SCC will not be
impaired.
“It’s a personal problem,’’

Folline said. ‘‘I realize that I made a
mistake, but I’m still the same person
that went to the Student Conduct
Committee last week.

“I’m going to talk to Dean
Howison Thursday morning and if he
feels like it’ll be a problem for me to
stay on the SCC, I'll withdraw
myself,”’ he said Wednesday evening.

SCC Chairman Chris Haley, a
senior, agreed that the charge against
Folline would not hamper Folline’s
judgement on SCC cases.

“*Sure, [SCC members] are held
to a higher standard, but the fact that
Read got a DUI has no relevance to

his sitting on the SCC,”’ Haley said. ,

“It’s a personal mistake. He knows
he made a mistake and it’s not going
to affect his judgement on any of our
cases.”’

Haley said the SCC would not
be involved in Folline’s case.

““We don’t hear cases involving
students driving drunk. That’s not a
school matter,’’ Haley said.

Folline’s advisement hearing has
been set for Feb. 25 in the Lexington
Rockbridge General District Court.

Beginning Monday, Washington
and Lee will join other colleges and
universities across the nation in ob-
serving ‘‘Safer Sex Week.”’

The highlight of the week is a
program entitled ‘‘Frisky Business,’’
which will deal with the prevention of
sexually transmitted diseases.

In order to reach a broader
audience, the Health Education Com-
mittee, which is sponsoring the we-
ek’s activities, has invited student
leaders to attend the program, said
Health Educator Jan Kaufman. Kauf-
man said the committee hopes these
leaders will pass on what they learn
to their respective groups.

“We want to highlight commu-
nication techniques,’’ Kaufman said.

 

Frisky’ week emphasizes
communication and safety

“Getting partners to talk before sex is
equally as important as condom use.”’

Chris Bray, administrative assis-
tant for residence life, said he hopes
students will ask questions.

‘*We need to be there to pro-
vide the information so anyone with
questions about sex issues and STD’s
can learn about solutions.”’

The program will be shown at 7
p.m. Thursday in duPont Hall. As an
additional part of ‘‘Safer Sex Week,”’
a basket of free condoms will be
available outside the infirmary.

Associate Dean of Students
Anne Schroer-Lamont said she hopes
students will realize that W&L is just
a small part of the national problem
of sexually transmitted diseases.

“It is important work because
students need a higher level of aware-
ness,”’ she said.

ig Four

Tuesday’s

officers to take their messages on the
road.

“Hi guys, sorry to disturb you

said the candidate to the Sigma Chi

Sophomore Blair Hixson, a can-

appearances before Monday’s election
are the key to having name recogni-

“It’s really difficult to get in

“With the turnout so low [at the
candidates’ forum], it’s important to

The candidates are taking varying

student voters this week.

Hixson said she was mainly

rather than going to group meetings.

“I think by going door-to-door,

“T hit a couple sorority meetings

|on five charges

Cadet to be tried in March, April

 

By CATHY LOPICCOLO
Phi News Editor

 

The former VMI cadet accused
of raping one W&L student and rob-
bing another will face two separate
trials this spring on a total of five
criminal charges, including a breaking
and entering charge added by the
Rockbridge County grand jury Mon-
day.

The grand jury indicted Monday
Chad Edward Hudnall, 18, of New-
port News, on charges of rape, sod-
omy, grand larceny and two counts of
breaking and entering.

Police originally charged Hud-
nall with breaking and entering only
in connection with the larceny. How-
ever, on Monday the grand jury add-
ed an additional breaking and entering
charge to the rape and sodomy charg-
es.

Hudnall, who withdrew from
Virginia Military Institute in October,
is scheduled to be tried March 11 for
rape and sodomy, according to a
county Circuit Court clerk. She said
the grand jury’s second breaking and
entering charge will probably be tried
at the same time.

Hudnall will go to trial April 3
for breaking and entering, and grand
larceny, according to the clerk.

He is currently being held at
Rockbridge County Regional Jail.

Hudnall is accused of raping and
sodomizing a W&L freshman in her
Gilliam Dormitory room on Oct. 13.
Junior Christin Harvey also alleges
that Hudnall broke into her room in
the same building and stole $354.

In a preliminary hearing Dec. 17,
an 18-year-old W&L freshman testi-
fied that she awoke about 4 a.m. on
Oct. 13 to find Hudnall naked and on
top of her. She said Hudnall forced
her to perform oral sex and raped her.

The woman said that when Hud-
nall released her, she ran into the hall
and screamed for help. Three male
WA&L students detained Hudnall until
W&L Security arrived.

Harvey testified that she was not
in her room on the morning of Oct.
13, but that when she returned that
night, over $300 was missing. Harvey
said she had left her door unlocked
while she was away.

Harvey also said someone had
drawn in lipstick on her mirror and
had burned part of a photograph in
her room.

Lab tests later identified a finger-
print on the scorched picture as be-
longing to Hudnall.

Police did not find the missing
money during a search of Hudnall’s
room at VMI. However, another cadet
turned over $354 to police a few days
later. He said he found the cash in
one of Hudnall’s boots.

Media marred by
Flowers frenzy

This week’s Time magazine claims the mainstream media
in America ‘‘reacted with unusual restraint’’ in its coverage
of the allegations by Gennifer Flowers that she had a 12-
year affair with Democratic presidential candidate Bill
Clinton. Wrong. The press’s most recent feeding frenzy was
marked by anything but restraint.

After the supermarket tabloid the Star paid Flowers an
estimated $130,000 to $175,000 to tell her story, members
of the mainstream press figured they’d better cover the story
lest their competitors scoop them. Heaven forbid someone
else might exercise bad taste before they did.

The best excuse the managing editor of The Washington
Post could come up with for running the story was that if
the Post didn’t tell its readers about the Flowers allegations,
readers might get the idea that the Post made a habit of not
reporting everything it found out about. Is this man looking
to have his job eliminated? If the Post really printed
everything it found out about, it would not need a managing
editor, whose job we thought it was to decide which stories
should be printed. Editors are the human filter built into the
media machine.

Similarly, television executives argue that allowing
cameras to cover trials live (like CNN’s coverage of the
Palm Beach rape case) is the same as allowing reporters to
cover the trials with a pencil and pad. ‘“‘It’s only allowing
the freedom of the press to keep up with technology,’’ they
say. Wrong again. A live camera shows everything, while a
reporter can balance the pros and cons of describing a
particular scene or using a particular quote. The element of
human understanding and compassion in reporting (while
often times hard to distinguish) is one of the essential
ingredients that makes the press an asset to society. Without
it, the press would be simply a babbling nuisance that
harmed many and aided few.

Where do we place the blame for the media’s behavior
in the Flowers’ story? It could be argued that the press, like
everyone else, is just out to make a buck. The press
couldn’t make a living supplying such stories if there wasn’t
a demand from the public. But that doesn’t make it right.
Crack dealers couldn’t make a living either if there wasn’t
a demand for their product.

It’s obvious that tabloid joumalism hurts _ those
scandalized in the stories. But it also hurts the readers by
sending the false message that the people have the right to
know everything about everyone, that nothing is too personal
to be aired in public. The press as a lookout for the ills of
our society is the enlightened inheritance from’ our
forefathers. The press as a prying, gossipy tell-all is the evil
invention of our own time.

And the winner
is... NO Surprise

Apathy on this campus has struck again. But this time it
has struck at the very core of campus leadership and
tradition. The president of the Executive Committee, the
chief spokesman of our cherished Honor System, will be
elected Monday from a slate of one. No offense to Josh
MacFarland, but we hardly believe that he is the only person
qualified to run for this important position.

But in this case apathy might not be the only problem.
The responsibility for informing potential candidates falls to
the Voting Regulations Board. The VRB not only oversees
elections, but gets the voters informed and out to vote. They
failed at announcing the upcoming elections. Signs should
have been everywhere, but there were very few. The notices
that were up to solicit candidates were complicated and dull;
they lacked creativity. Now the VRB is failing at informing
the public about the candidates that are running. The
candidate’s forum held yesterday afternoon seemed like a
spur-of-the-moment affair with publicity to match. As can
be expected, only about 30 people showed up. What’s next?
Dare we assume the voting boxes will be out?

Spectator fake ad
continues attack

To the Editor:

Like the proverbial dog returning to its
vomit, the Spectator just had to renew its disgust-
ing attack upon the people who clean fraternity
halls and bathrooms. I refer to the satirical ad
appearing on page 11 of the campus rag’s latest
issue (February 1992). The Spectator babies seem
to think that the maintenance staff are lucky to be
scrubbing their floors. The sight of ‘‘young bare-
chested college men in their boxers when you
wake them up at ungodly hours of the morning,’
according to the Spectator, is ample motivation
for grown men and women to get up even earlier
in order to clean up the ‘‘men’s’’ messes.

I won’t speculate on the extent to which
visions of boxer-clad youths excite the Spectator
babies; but I do have two suggestions for them.
First, think about how your purported icon,
General Lee, would look upon the mean-spirited,
sneering joy you take in degrading people less
economically fortunate than you. And then, you
pampered scum, you might try doing some real
work yourselves and see how you like it.

As ever,
Niall MacKenzie, ’93

Please control
Colonnade pets

To the Editor:

The University Security Department has
received several complaints recently concerning
dogs on campus grounds. These complaints range
from dogs running loose, to dogs barking and
disturbing classes and work areas, to dogs fight-
ing and frightening people who are walking in
the area. The number of dogs on campus during
the school day seems to be increasing, and direct
control over the animals is decreasing. Lexington
city ordinances require that dogs be on leashes.

In the interest of being good neighbors and
community members, anyone bringing a dog to
campus should be more responsible in the care
and handling of their dogs. It seems unfair to the
dog that it be tied to a bench or tree all day. We
are asking that persons who are doing this please
consider leaving their pets at home. Dogs are
wonderful companions, but they require responsi-
ble care. Questions and comments can be directed
to the Security Department at 463-8427.

Sincerely,
Michael L. Young
Director of Security

Lip synch contest
a great success

To the Editor:

The sixth annual Students Against Multiple
Sclerosis (SAMS) Rock Alike Contest is history.
Although the rumor that Mrs. Thatcher was to
perform the opening act was unfounded, everyone
who is anyone in the W&L community was there.
How about 19 acts, 728 paid admissions and
gross proceeds of $3,215 toward the fight against
Multiple Sclerosis, the crippler of predominantly
young adults?

How do we begin to thank all of the volun-
teers who gave their time and energy to make the
evening such a smashing success? To our es-
teemed judging panel — Professors Campbell,
Spice, Sanders, Rush, Goldsmith and Boswell —
it was evident that the crowd totally agreed with
your selections. To MCs Andrew Keller and Billy
Brinkman, Bob Dunlap, Chris Smith and Hunter
Catlett, security managers John Hufnagel, Gordon
Wilkens and their staffs. To Tidge Roller, Scott
Dittman and Baner, the first members of the
W&L staff to perform at Lip Synch (and the
crowd loved it — we are looking for faculty
involvement on stage next year). Thanks to the
Student Activities Board and Buildings and

 

LETTERS

Grounds for their usual fine cooperation. Thanks
also to all the acts who did such a great job in
their support for this worthy cause. To all the
other volunteers and to all the spectators who
came out and paid three dollars for a night of
total enjoyment — they certainly got their mon-
ey’s worth.

And certainly, we must congratulate our
winners: 1st place — Cheeze Whiz who wowed
the crowd with their version of ‘‘Copacabana,”’
2nd place — Stickman and the Cat Walks who
brought the house down with ‘I’m Too Sexy”’
and 3rd place — The Bozaks who had the judges
on their feet dancing to ‘‘Motown Philly.’’ The
taped performance of the top two acts will be
sent to New York to compete in the national
contest. Twelve finalists will be selected to
perform live on MTV at Daytona Beach in March

“(remember, the FIJIs won the national contest in

1990 and took home a new Ford Thunderbird).

But the biggest thanks and ovation is saved
for the event organizers, our SAMS committee:
Clayton Kennington, Karen Halsell, Michael
Patrick and Morgan Warmer. These four began
organizing the ’92 event last January, immediate-
iy following the ’91 event. Many hours were
spent last spring, this past fall and then, following
Christmas break, it became full-time work. With
the help of their friends, they organized the event,
physically did all the magnificent decorating,
physically set up the Pavilion, had their specific
roles during the Friday evening show and finally,
with the help of Scott Dittman and Bob Dunlap,
stayed until 1 a.m. Saturday cleaning up. Guys,
you four were the best, you couldn’t have given
more of yourselves. You have my respect and
admiration for a job well done. As they say in the
United Way campaign: Thanks to all of you, it
works, the W&L way!

Sincerely,
Jerry Darrell
SAMS Advisor

Student defends
Phi coverage

To the Editor:

In response to the letter last week from
Niall MacKenzie (‘‘Student protests Thatcher
Coverage’’), I would like to say that I considered
it to be quite unfair. The purpose of the Phi is to
bring recent, unbiased news to the student body.
In its third page coverage of Thatcher’s lecture,
I'd say the staff did just that. Though we may not
all like Margaret Thatcher or everything she has
ever done, it was cruel to accuse the Phi of
political bias, which it clearly avoided. I am
looking forward to Mr. MacKenzie’s opinion on
her lecture, but let’s not ‘‘protest’’ objective
reporting that might be interesting to some stu-
dents.

Sincerely,
Finbar B. Burke, 95

SAC: Vote and
vote wisely

To the Editor:

Last year, the Student Affairs Committee
worked hard to redesign the Student Conduct
Committee. One of our primary goals was to
make the SCC more responsive to student disci-
plinary issues. In addition to granting the SCC
autonomy from SAC, we developed, in coopera-
tion with the Executive Committee, the election
of the Student Conduct Committee chairman into
a ‘‘Big Four’’ election.

This month, for the first time in Washington
and Lee history, the chairman of the Student
Conduct Committee will be directly elected by

   

the student body. In the past, the chairman has
been appointed by the EC. We urge all students
to give this election special attention... When it
comes time to vote, support the candidate who
best represents the qualities of integrity, maturity
and honor that make Washington and Lee a
special place.

 

Sincerely,

The Members of the Student Affairs Committee:
David Howison, Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins, Cinda
Rankin, Robert de Maria, Alexandra Brown,
Giles Perkins, Gregory Hicks, Robert Weisgerber,
Christopher Haley and M. Peebles Harrison.

Junior president
discusses election

Members of the Student Body:

The season of school elections is once again
upon us. The familiar Big Three offices remain
for your approval, but they have been joined this
year by the president of the Student Conduct
Committee. Formerly, the president of the SCC
was appointed by the Executive Committee from
a pool of interested parties, usually existing class
officers. But last year, in an attempt to foster
greater student involvement in the SCC, the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee voted to alter the format
of selection to a school-wide election of SCC
president. This election would occur in conjunc-
tion with the existing Big Three, but would
require a devilishly clever new appellation: the
Big Four.

All levity aside, this is the first time that the
students have had direct control over the leader-
ship of the SCC, and this responsibility warrants
deliberate consideration. The president of the
SCC plays a very important role in student affairs
at Washington and Lee. The SCC president is
responsible for receiving complaints of alleged
misconduct, conducting a preliminary investiga-
tion and then presiding over hearings, for starters.
The new SCC constitution, approved last year by
SAC, is somewhat vague on procedure. This
allows for a myriad of interpretations by the
president. A candidate without experience in
previous SCC matters would have a more diffi-
cult time constructing a judicial environment that
is fair to all parties involved than someone with
practical experience and an historical perspective
on procedure. The SCC is not a dog-and-pony
show; it has dealt with in the past, and will
continue to deal with issues of gravity for those
involved and the entire W&L community. The
SCC president provides the third of the four
voting members of SAC elected by the students.
As everyone should know, SAC is by far the
most powerful committee at W&L in terms of
influence on far-reaching aspects of student life,
and its membership should be of great concern to
us all.

The aforementioned are some of the factors
at stake in the election of the president of the
SCC... I would just like to encourage all members
of the student body to make themselves more
aware of the issues and candidates involved in
Monday’s Big Four elections, and, most impor-
tantly, vote accordingly.

Sincerely,
Richard Burke
President, Class of '93

_ Magazine

receives half

its budget

By CATHY LOPICCOLO
Phi News Editor

The W&L Publications Board
Monday allocated one-half the money
requested for the new student news
magazine and said it would transfer
the rest after the magazine’s editor
revises his list of story ideas.

Jimmy Walsh, editor of the new
magazine, The Footbridge, presented

 

 

the first issue’s budget and list of

stories at Monday’s board meeting.

Walsh requested $397 for a 24-
page magazine or $344 for 20 pages.
Story ideas included interviews with
alumni, play reviews and columns.

The board members expressed
concern because Walsh did not pro-
pose news articles or news-features.

‘‘When we first talked about
starting the new magazine, my motion
was to create a news magazine,”’ said
Tonya Yoder, Pub Board vice presi-
dent and Ariel editor. ‘‘Jimmy had
good ideas and interesting opinion
articles, but I wish there had been
more news.’

Walsh said he was happy, with —

the’ original story ideas, but'that add-
ing news would not be a problem.
‘*People were just more interest-
ed in writing features and opinion,”’
Walsh said. ‘‘We’ll just have to make
a conscious decision to balance it.’’
Walsh wanted to publish the
first issue of The Footbridge in late

February or early March, but the Pub

Board recommended he wait until
mid-March so he has time to plan
more news stories.

The board voted to give the

magazine $175 immediately, one-half
of the amount Walsh said he needed

for a 20-page issue. The Pub Board

_ said it will transfer the other $175
after it approves a revised story list.
The first issue of The Foot-
bridge will be funded by the board.

Board President and Ring-tum Phi
Editor Rick Peltz said the second
issue must show that the magazine
can support itself with advertising

revenues.

Dance aids grad’ s son

 

By JENNIFER MAYO
Phi Staff Reporter

 

The 14th annual Muscular Dys-
trophy Superdance will be for some-
one close to Washington and Lee’s
heart.

Proceeds from this weekend’s
fundraiser will go to: research for
Andrew Slay, the son of Joe Slay,
72. Andrew was born with Spinal
Muscular Atrophy, the number one
killer of children under two years old.

“This year is exciting because
it’s the first year that we have target-
ed the money to a specific case of
Muscular Dystrophy,’’ said Laura
Hendrey, Superdance co-chairman.

Last year the event raised
$27,000, and this year’s goal is to
match or surpass that total.

“So far we are ahead of last
year’s totals,’” said Co-Chairman Fred
Renneker, ‘‘and we still have to col-
lect admissions to the bands [for]
both nights, which last year totaled
$9,000.’

Students who pledged to dance
have each collected donations of at
least $100, promising to dance for 14
hours on Friday and Saturday. Each

fundraiser

 

of the fraternities and sororities has
members participating in the dance.

Several W&L_ organizations
have also donated money to the
cause, including the Executive Com-
mittee, the Student Telephone Union
and the Student Bar Association.

A total of eight bands will per-
form during the weekend. Friday
night features the ‘Battle of the
Bands,”’ with six local bands compet-
ing and opening for Boy-O-Boy, the
main attraction. Saturday night will
feature Friday night’s first- and sec-
ond-place winners opening for The
Truly Dangerous Swamp Band.

Admission for both Friday and
Saturday nights is $7. If tickets are
bought separately, Friday costs $3
and Saturday costs $5.

|PHC may
get vote
in March

By LEIGH ALLEN
Phi Staff Reporter

The faculty will decide March 3
if the Panhellenic Council will get a
vote on the Student Affairs Commit-
tee.

Dean of Students David Howi-
son said he expects the faculty to
approve the proposal to give PHC a
vote on SAC, even though the faculty
defeated a similar proposal two years
ago.

“I feel very confident that the
faculty will support this measure,”’
Howison said.

Howison and Executive Com-
mittee President Giles Perkins, who
sits on SAC, introduced the proposal
Monday at the faculty’s monthly
meeting. The faculty has 30 days to
consider the idea before voting on it
March 3.

The proposal would make the
PHC president a voting member of
SAC, giving students a 6-5 majority
on the committee. Currently, five stu-
dents, three faculty members and two
administrators sit on SAC.

Associate Professor of Romance
Languages Kathy Jo Koberstein, who
led the opposition to a similar propos-
al two years ago, said the faculty is
likely to oppose SAC’s proposal be-
cause of the numerical imbalance that
it would create between students and
faculty on the committee.

‘I’m not opposed to Panhel
having a vote on SAC,’’ Koberstein
said. ‘‘The addition of a student
needs to come in a way that won’t
give the students a majority on the
committee.’

J. Holt Merchant, professor of
history, said he favors giving PHC a
vote on SAC, provided that a sixth
faculty member is also added to the
committee.

Howison said SAC would con-
sider that option if the present propos-
al were defeated.

‘‘T respect faculty caution in this
matter,’” Howison said.

 

Wanted: Religion, Japanese, French profs

 

By ERIN MCKINNEY
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Come September, students will
have to start new cold-test files for
three departments.

The religion, Japanese and ro-
mance language departments are
searching for new faculty members.

Professor Harlan Beckley, head of
the religion department, said the de-
partment needs someone to teach East
Asian religion. Professor Minor Rog-
ers, who died in August, previously
taught the classes.

Graduate students from the Uni-
versity of Virginia were hired to teach
the classes this year, but the depart-
ment wants a professor who can take
over permanently, Beckley said.

‘‘We have been advertising and
have contacted numerous graduate
schools,’’ he said, and the department
has received many applications.

‘‘We are considering [a range of
candidates from] those who are senior

What is your

“professors to those who have just

completed their doctorates,’ he said.

The . Japanese department is
searching for a teaching assistant to
help handle the increasing number of
students taking Japanese classes, said
Ken’ichi Ujie, assistant professor of
Japanese. The department now has
two full-time professors and one
teaching assistant.

‘*(A] qualified candidate from a
private school in Tokyo was recom-
mended,’’ Ujie said. ‘‘We are im-
pressed with both the candidate and
his resume.”’

The romance languages depart-
ment is planning ahead to meet its
upcoming need for a French teacher.
Edward Hamer, professor of romance
languages, is in ‘‘phased retirement’
and his responsibilities will decrease
gradually, said Russell Knudson,
associate professor of romance lan-
guages. He said the department is
searching for someone to ‘‘phase in.”’

‘*This ‘changeover’ method will

 

Beckley

be very advantageous to everyone
involved,’’ Knudson said. He said the
new job will be a permanent one.

According to Knudson, the de-
partment originally received almost
100 applications for the position.

‘*One of the most important ques-
tions to be considered during the
selection process,’’ Knudson said,
‘tis, ‘How comfortable will everyone
be working together?’ ”’

HIV-infected alumnus
pushes playing it safe

 

By JOYCE BAUTISTA
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee alumnus
Edwin Wright is one of the one mil-
lion people in the United States in-
fected with the AIDS virus.

Wright, °78, said he knows of at
least six W&L alumni who have died
from the human immunodeficiency
virus.

‘“T’m not the first W&L grad
who has been stricken with HIV,”’ he
said, ‘‘and I will not be the last.’’

Wright said he stopped hiding
his homosexuality in 1982, and he
suspected for over five years that he
may have been exposed to the virus.

‘“‘Because I was in a risk
group,”’ he said, ‘‘the possibility was
always hanging over my head. I don’t
know who, I don’t know when. I just
hope it was a good time.”’

But Wright said he looked and
felt healthy, so he resisted his doc-
tor’s attempts to make him take an
AIDS test until 1985.

‘I was asymptomatic,”’ he said.
‘“‘[My doctor] had to pretty much
bludgeon me into taking the test.

“I was devastated,” Wright
said. ‘‘When I heard that I had tested
positive, it felt like a trap had fallen
from beneath my feet.’

Later that year, Wright became
interested in helping those afflicted
with the disease when he read a se-
ries of articles in a Philadelphia news-
paper about a 22-year-old man who
was dying of AIDS.

‘I was afraid I could be one of
those people,’’ he said, ‘‘someone
who lost his job and lost touch with
his friends and family.”’

So since late 1985, Wright, who
is a paralegal for Aetna Life and
Casualty, has served as a volunteer
‘buddy,’ or friend and confidant for
people who have tested HIV-positive.
Additionally, he has chaired the
buddy program at AIDS Project Hart-
ford for the last three years.

During his time as a buddy,
Wright always knew that one day he
might himself be the recipient of the
program’s generosity, according to

Aetna Sphere, an Aetna publication.

“‘That’s one of the reasons I
went into it,’’ Wright said. *‘I thought
that I’d sure want someone to be
there for me. And how could I expect
that to happen if I was never willing
to do it for someone else?’’

He said he decided not to run
for an office in last week’s AIDS
Project Hartford election.

“*T just want to be a client for
awhile,’’ Wright said.

AIDS was not even the known
in 1978, Wright said. Fortunately for
him, he said, he has a strong support
system.

“I’ve been lucky in that re-
gard,’’ he said. ‘‘I have the complete
support of everyone I work with, my
family and my friends.”’

Of course, some people still fear
the disease and his imminent death.

‘*Fear has only come from those
who care,’’ he said. ‘‘Most people
don’t want to talk about it, but I don’t
want to dismiss reality.”’

Wright said combatting the
disease requires a national, rational
focus. Instead, he said, it is often
treated as a social stigma, perpetuat-
ing the fear and revulsion many peo-
ple feel toward AIDS.

‘*AIDS is not caused by [intra-
venous] drug use or homosexual sex,
it is a virus,’’ Wright said. ‘‘It is
simply passed by these and other
activities.”

According to the Centers for
Disease Control, AIDS is transmitted
through shared intravenous drug
needles and unprotected sexual con-
tact. A very small number of people
have contracted AIDS through blood
transfusions.

Wright said education is the
best way to alleviate the ignorance
and fear surrounding AIDS.

“*Until the subject is dealt with
on an intelligent level,’’ he said,
‘‘nothing is going to happen to stop
it”

Citing the fact that AIDS has
not changed his appearance, Wright
stressed the importance of ‘‘playing it
safe’’ when it comes to unprotected

Sex.

Wright tested HIV positive in 1985 and has been working to help
others afflicted with AIDS ever since.

“If someone is going to indulge
in high-risk behavior,’’ he said,
“‘there are ways to make the risk low
or none at all. Don’t be fooled by
appearances. If [you are] worried
about the risk, don’t be talked out of
that risk.”’

Wright said he still shows no
symptoms of AIDS and hopes to live
five to seven more years. But he said
he realizes there is no immediate
hope for a cure to the disease.

“*I know what’s going to hap-
pen,’’ he said. ‘‘I just don’t know
when.”’

As a buddy, Wright has watched
four people die from the symptoms of
AIDS and knows of many others, but
he said knowing what to expect does-
n’t make facing death easier.

“‘T know exactly what I’m in
for,’’ he said. ‘“That takes away a lot
of the hope that comes with being
ignorant. You know what they say,
‘Ignorance is bliss.’

“I’m just wondering when the

.use is going to go off and I'll be-
come ill,”’ he said.

Wright said people say they are
amazed to find him the same funny
“‘character’’ he has always been,
““but I can’t say that I am.”’

Still, he said he has no ‘‘big
trip’’ to take or ‘‘big goal’’ to accom-
plish before he dies.

“If I died tomorrow,”’ he said,
“IT wouldn’t be cheated out of any
specific dream.”’

Wright said he just wants to live
as he always has. He wants to keep
working and seeing his friends, he
said.

Wright currently works with
AIDS Project Hartford in a support
group for those infected with and
affected by the virus. Recently, he
spoke at the University of Hartford to
help educate others on the disease.

“‘T just want to help prevent it
from happening [to others] so some-
one can live,’’ he said. ‘‘There isn’t
any reason for anyone else to die.’’

Who’s older than 22, sits in the
back row of a classroom and never
takes exams?

Well, he’s probably a professor,
and maybe someone like Arthur Gol-
dsmith, associate prof. of economics.

Since his arrival at Washington
and Lee last year, Goldsmith has
taken two undergraduate classes in
the psychology department and is
currently enrolled in Psychology 113:
Principles of Development. He man-
ages to do all this despite a heavy
teaching and research schedule.

‘“Education and learning is a life-
long opportunity,’’ he said.

Goldsmith said taking classes
allows him to continue the learning
process, to identify more with ‘‘the
undergraduate experience,’’ to see
“‘other teachers in action,’’ and to
contribute insights into his research.

He said it is vital to ‘‘be exposed
to different people with different
talents and scholarly interests.”’

In fact, Goldsmith’s study of psy-
chology has contributed ‘‘a certain
richness’’ to his research, he said.

 

 

Prof turns student

One of his current projects is ‘‘to
expand conventional macroeconomic
models to account for relevant theo-
ries developed by psychologists.”’

The project focuses on introduc-
ing the cognitive, motivational and
emotional _ ef-
fects of prior
exposure to un-
employment
into economic
models intend-
ed to explain
current wages,
and job status.

Goldsmith
and Assistant
Prof. of Eco-
nomics Michael
Anderson have
produced and
are now testing a theory that execu-
tive optimism about the future of their
industries and the accuracy of their
previous predictions affect how much
money is invested in plants and
equipment for the industry.

Apart from psychology’s impor-
tance to his research, Goldsmith said
he takes classes to experience the joy
of learning.

March will be busy

 

By NICOLE KEELER
Phi Staff Reporter

Fancy Dress, which is March 27, will have plenty of help in adding
stress to the lives of W&L students in March. Mock Convention is three weeks
before the ball, and finals begin the week following FD. Most professors
anticipate a decline in student productivity during the month of March, and
some are adjusting their syllabuses accordingly.

Prof. of History John Parker laughed heartily when asked if he expects
students’ academic work to suffer during March.

“‘Of course I do,’’ Parker said. ‘I don’t get mad about it. I don’t in-
crease the workload. I go on about my business.

Roger Crockett, a prof. of German, is new to W&L and has not

experienced the FD week.

‘*There has been some talk among my colleagues of concem, but I’m not

concerned,’’ he said. ‘“The students here are serious. They can handle it.

‘*The syllabus has not been decreased. It will be business as usual, but

I’ll understand if problems arise,’’ Crockett said.

FD Chairman Elizabeth Vallotton said she doesn’t think MC and finals

will dampen the ball’s festivities.

‘*What in the past has ever stopped a W&L student from going to a par-

ty?’’ Vallotton asked.

The Ring-tum Phi, February 6, 1992

‘Big Four’ candidates speak out on Campus issues ©

Questions for the EC officer candidates:
1. What is your opinion of the Confidential Review Committee?

2. What do you think of the proposals to move Fraternity Rush to Winter Term?
3. What do you think the role of the EC should be in administering the Honor

System?

Answers from the candidates:

 

Presidential
Candidate

Josh
MacFarland

Class of ’93

 

1 « “The CRC should retain its role
in handling cases of sexual assault.
Having served as an ad hoc member,
I believe the SCC can handle all other
forms of harassment.’’

2. “It’s a bad idea. The current

system runs extremely well and ‘If it
ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’ ”’

a “It is important for the EC to
make sure honor system remains a
student honor system. Students are
invested with the difficult task of
turning in honor violations. They are
the ones who must make it work.”’

Vice-presidential Candidates

  

4 A Class of ’93

1 . ‘The CRC is not going along
with the standards of the university.
The SCC should be able to handle all
matters involving harassment.’’

2. “There is no need for winter
rush. I don’t see how fall rush hurts
anybody now or needs to be changed.
Winter rush will hurt more houses
than it would help.”’

3. “The job of the EC is to uphold
the honor and integrity of the
institution and to maintain the
autonomy of the student
government.”’

Ames
Hutton

Class of ’94

 

1 » “‘T think the student body as a
whole does not understand the CRC,
and therefore, it is not an effective
judiciary body. With a clarification
and explanation of its rules and
processes, it has the potential to be a
positive force at W&L.”’

2. “‘Moving rush would create a
six-month rush period, during which
houses would spend an excessive
amount of money on rushees. If this
proposal is to be accepted, the
university would have to provide a
Student Center where students could
partake of the
same activities offered at fraternity
parties.”’

3 “‘The EC must not only enforce
the honor system and defend it
against offenders, but also set the
example for the W&L community in
interpreting and living under this
code.”’

i} Andrew
| Schneider

pe
7 “The speech code should be
abolished. It is a violation of the First
Amendment. The CRC itself is a
good thing as long as it would be
accountable to the student body.

Members should be appointed by the
faculty and approved by the EC.’’

Class of ’94

 

2. **T think it’s a good proposal. It
would take a lot of pressure off
freshmen and give them time to
adjust [to college life] before they
choose a fraternity.”’

2. “‘T think their role entails both
education of incoming freshman and
faculty as well as administering the
honor system.”’

 

Election a first
for SCC chairman

Questions:

1. What kind of cases should the SCC

handle?

2. What should be the relationship
between the SCC and the CRC?

Answers:

Betsy Kleiner, ‘93

1. “‘The SCC should handle all
offenses outside the honor system,
such as student misconduct. It may
start dealing with cases of racial and
sexual abuse.”’

2. ‘It’s hard to divide where
the SCC should stop and the CRC
should take up. But we definitely
need the CRC.”’

Richard Burke, ‘93

1. “* I can better answer that
by saying what the SCC should not
handle. It should stay out of the
matters in the dorms, such as
alcohol violations. But, I am in
favor of handling matters in the
fraternity houses. Now that they are
owned by the university, it is no
longer just an internal matter.’’

2 "We feel: were 4
responsible, mature body and can
rule in most harassment cases.
Sexual assault cases belong in the
courts, but with the university
providing counseling at the very
least. We’re not trained to handle
sexual assault, but neither is the
CRE

 

Chase Davis, ‘93

1. ‘‘The SCC should handle
any conduct cases--drinking in the
dorms, conduct in the fraternities, on
the hill or in the community. It
should be all inclusive.”’

2. ‘*The SCC is fully qualified
and well enough informed to handle
verbal harassment--sexual, ethnic or
racial. Unless an action is
completely malicious and flagrant,
the SCC can handle it.”’

Reggie Aggarwal, ‘94L

1. ‘‘The SCC should handle
anything not under the EC’s
jurisdiction, [like] getting drunk and
breaking a window. If a house
gives a member 10 hours of
community service, the SCC will
probably give them the same
thing.’’

2. ‘‘Sexual assault should be
handled by the CRC. It’s a personal
and sensitive issue for females and
males. In regards to _ verbal
harassment, the students should be
deciding what we _ consider
acceptable in our community, not
President Wilson.’’

 

 

 

Secretarial Candidates

Ashby Hackney, ‘94

1. ‘‘The CRC is ineffective now
but the concept is important. Matters
like the CRC handles do not belong
in front of an imposing body like the
EC. They are best handled by
someone who is experienced.”’

2. ‘‘The tradition of fall rush is
easier on fraternities and on freshmen.
It gives freshmen something to
identify with and gives them a base.
And in meeting people, you learn a
lot about the university.”

3. ‘‘The EC should operate
exactly as outlined in the White Book
to protect the integrity and the honor
code of the university. It should make
sure the sense of honor of General
Lee’s time continues today.”’

Robyn McCord, ‘93
1. ‘‘The CRC is a valid and

necessary committee, though its
borders have yet to be defined.
Verbal harassment and sexual assault
are two very different issues and they
should be treated as such.”’

2. ‘Winter rush obviously takes
a lot of controversy and problems that
arise in fall term out of the way. But,
not being a guy, I can’t speak from
personal experience as to which is
better.”’

3. “‘The EC should offer as much
guidance as possible about the honor
system without being an iron hand of
the law.”’

Bob Tompkins, ‘90, ‘94L
1. ‘‘The lack of cases brought in
front of the CRC raises serious
questions about its validity and
necessity. But, charges of sexual
misconduct need to be handled

confidentially so as not to discourage
people from bringing charges
forward. The SCC should have an
expanded role, including some things
which are currently under the
jurisdiction of the CRC. Things like
racial incidents should be handled by
a body of students who are elected,
not appointed.”’

2. ‘Freshmen need something to
do in the fall. Fraternities are the
social outlet here. It is unrealistic to
expect them not to associate with
three-quarters of the [men at W&L].
I would also be hard to enforce no
contact rules for that long. It would
essentially be rush for four months.
But, some compromise might be
possible.”’

3. “The EC is principally
charged with the administration of the
honor system, which includes the
education of students and faculty

 

about how the system works and
confronting those who are accused of
violating the system. People on the
EC need to understand what members
of the W&L community think honor
is. As a student at W&L for six years,
I think I understand what the
community believes honor is.’’

Ted Elliott, 94

1. “‘It’s a pile. It’s a way for the
university to cover itself when a
controversial issue comes up. The
CRC should be abolished. It is
against the school’s tradition of
student government.”’

2. ‘‘Winter rush is mainly an IFC
issue, but it’s not a good idea. The
EC should work with the IFC when
students’ interests conflict with the
administration.’’

3. ‘‘The EC should enforce it, but

also keep in mind the human factor.
They should be able to balance
justice and personal service.”’

Nathan Dunn, ‘94

1. ‘‘They need to turn a lot more
responsibility over to the elected
student government, such as the SCC.
We need more student decisions in
the harassment policy, rather than in
the faculty-dominated CRC.”’

2. ‘Based on where the
university is in reshaping the social
life, it is not time for winter rush.
Maybe a few years down the road it
will be beneficial, but now we are not
ready.”

3. ‘The EC _ investigates
violations of the honor code.
Sometimes in investigations in EC,
I’ve thought about how ironic it is
that we must carry out the honor

Generals hang tough at
Virginia Wesleyan, 86-74

 

By JAY PLOTKIN
Phi Sports Editor

On Wednesday, the Washington
and Lee basketball team travelled to
Norfolk to take on the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference’s top team.

The Generals, battling for the
final ODAC Tournament spot with
two other teams, gave Virginia
Wesleyan as much as it wanted
before finally succumbing 86-74.

W&L scored the first seven
points of the game sparked by senior
Mark Melton’s three-point shot, but
VWC responded with 15 straight
points, Walt Lassiter and Scott Spruill
did all the scoring and put the
Marlins ahead for good.

After holding the Generals to 33
percent shooting in the first half, the
Marlins opened up a 50-35 lead in
the second half before the Generals
made the first of two second half
runs.

The Generals cut the lead to just
five at 54-49 when a variety of
different players scored, but the
Marlins opened the lead back out to
71-55 with six minutes left.

But sophomore Paul Baker
sparked another W&L run with back-
to-back three-pointers and _ the
Generals went on a 16-4 run to cut
the lead to 75-71 with 2:40 left.

The Marlins, though, didn’t
break and made their free throws

down the stretch to hold on for the
win. The loss drops W&L to 5-14
and 2-11 in ODAC play for the
season.

Baker matched his career-high
to lead W&L with 20 points.
Sophomore Robert Miggins also
added a career-high. He finished with
16. Junior Bryan Watkins was also in
double figures with 14, including 12
in the second half.

Lassiter had 24 and Rick Chalk
had 20 for the Marlins, who beat the
Generals for the first time in three
years in Va. Beach.

W&L will next travel to play
Guilford Saturday night in
Greensboro, N.C.

 

 

From staff reports

 

Washington and Lee’s women’s
swimming team kept its ODAC
winning streak alive with a 137-25
win over Bridgewater as they gear
up for this week’s meet with
Hollins.

The Generals, who have won
13 straight ODAC dual meets since
December of 1987, host Hollins on
Friday night in a key meet.

Against the Eagles, the
Generals won every race to coast to
the win. Senior Jodi Herring, junior
Claire Dudley and freshman Susan
Fisher each won twice and swam
legs on winning relay races as well.

Solo winners in individual
competition included freshmen
Brandi Henderson, Stacy Cofield
and Marina Vasilara.

Washington and Lee’s women’s
track team competed at Virginia
Tech against some of the top teams
in the state last weekend and saw

some solid performances.
Freshman Kim Herring ran a

just seven seconds off the school
record. Sophomore Stefanie Brown
ran the 400-meter dash in 1:08, the
best time indoors for a W&L
runner,

This was the last full meet for

the Generals before the unofficial
ODAC Championships, which will
be held on Feb. 29 at VMI.

The men’s track got some good
indivudual performances in the
largely Division I field at the VMI
Relays.

Senior Jim Henry finished
fourth in the shot put with a heave
of 45-6. Junior Bo Hannah ran a
season-best 8:55.6 in the 3,000-
meters and freshman Grant Cowell
ran a 2:02.4 in the 800-meters. That
time is the best in the ODAC this
winter. W&L is getting ready for
the ODAC Championships to be
held at VMI on Feb, 29.

Senior Doug Brown swims his way to another win in a meet
earlier this year.

Brown caps winning month with Phi honor

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE
Phi Staff Reporter

 

It has been quite a month for
senior swimmer Doug Brown.

He was honored by his
teammates and coaches in the last
home meet of his career against
Georgetown. He has been the
catalyst behind the Generals’ 3-2
mark for the month.

He can add one more feather
in his cap. He is The Ring-tum Phi
Athlete of the Month for January.

“*It caught me by surprise,”’
said Brown.

But not much has been surpris-
ing for Brown this month. He’s been
the model of consistency for the
Generals. He had three-win meets
against the College of Charleston
and Georgetown.

He also had two-win meets
against Buffalo State and Swarth-
more. Brown will admit that this has
his best year.

“I’m swimming consistently
faster in the dual meets this year,’’
he said. ‘‘I think it’s going to help
me swim faster and score better at
nationals.”’

Coach Page Remillard is just

as confident in Brown.

“It will be [his best year],”’
said Remillard. ‘‘A swimmer
doesn’t have his best year until his
last year, and this is Doug’s last
year.”’

However, Brown’s been work-
ing up to this year for the past three
years. He made a commitment to
himself to succeed and has stuck to
it.

It’s determination that keys
Brown’s success.

““My strongest attribute as a
swimmer is that I’m determined,”’
said Brown. ‘‘I do what it takes to
win. You can’t beat me in the first
few laps, you have to beat me in the
last lap.”’

This determination has made
Brown the team leader. It’s a role he
doesn’t shy away from, but one he
believes where mere words can’t do
the job.

“I’m not very outspoken. Talk
is cheap,”’ he said. ‘‘I like to lead
with my efforts and results. I also
like to find motivational material
that will inspire the guys. Little
phrases or speeches that will add to
what I’m trying to show them.”’

There is a price to pay for

being so focused, though, and
Remillard says that he hopes Brown
doesn’t pay that price for being so
focused on swimming.

““Doug’s the type of guy you
don’t tell ‘you can’t do it’ because
he’ll go out and do it. For me as a
coach, it’s a pleasure to work with
an athlete like that, but there are
other things at college that you miss
out on with that kind of drive.

“I think Doug could have
been a little less focused on
swimming and still done a great job.
But like I said, he has that drive to
do everything he sets his mind to.
That is an honorable trait that will
probably work for Doug, but it may
not work for everyone else.”’

The year isn’t over for Brown
and his teammates. There are still
two dual meets to go and then the
championships and nationals. This
is the time where Brown believes
the team will start to peak.

““Coach times everything per-
fectly here. The entire team will
start to swim much faster and will
be at peak performance come the
championships,’’ said Brown.

However, there is also one
personal goal Brown has yet to

achieve. John Hudson has two long-
standing records in the 500-yard and
1,000-yard freestyles. Brown
believes that they will be his by the
end of the year.

‘*Yes, I can break them, and
yes, I will break them,”’ he said
emphatically.

Remillard believes Brown can
do it, but the records are not a main
goal.

“It’s not even a conscious
thought. I believe he can do it, but
he has to understand that wanting it
has nothing to do with breaking it,’’
he said.

For right now, though, Brown
and the Generals must get ready for
a very tough dual meet at Mary
Washington this Saturday. Remillard
sees this as the meet that either
brings W&L out of the shadows of
other teams, or leave them behind.

“It’s not a must-win, but it
would help to solidify our program’s
reputation among other Division III
teams. The loser will have to wait a
year for another opportunity,”’ said
Remillard.

And if Brown maintains his
Athlete of the Month numbers, the
Generals won’t have long to wait.

More and more, the 1991-92
basketball season looks like it holds a
stacked deck against the Washington
and Lee Generals.

Every team the Generals play
has a player or group of players who
have their best games of the year —
against the Generals.

In Bridgewater's 78-71 win, Jeff
Berry had a career-day. Early in the
year, Emory & Henry’s Ross Kirtley
scored a career-high 32 points. The
latest addition to the list is the entire
Roanoke College team.

In the Maroons’ 98-76 win over
the Generals Saturday, Michael
Thorton scored a career-best 21
points, and the Maroons shot an
incredible 73 percent for the game.

The Generals watched in
amazement as the Maroons missed
just five first half shots, shooting 78
percent. Hillary Scott made all six of
his shots and Roanoke led 43-27 at
halftime. In contrast, the Generals
shot 36 percent in the half.

WA&L started strong, getting out
to a 12-6 lead on the strength of two
Bryan Watkins three-point shots and
four points from Mark Melton, but
Roanoke responded with a 23-3 run,
keyed by seven points from Joe
Schrantz.

The Generals got within 10
points in the final minute, but

Junior Bryan Watkins knocks down one of his team-leading 49 three-pointers against Hampden-
Sydney last week. The Generals are the leading three-point bombers in the ODAC.

Thorton hit two three-pointers to send
the Maroons into the locker room
with momentum.

W&L got as close as 14 points
in the second half, but the Maroons
controlled things and coasted to the
98-76 win. Paul Baker led W&L with
17 points, all in the second half.
Watkins finished with 16, Bryan
Brading had 13 and Melton 11.

The loss caused head coach
Verne Canfield to make some
changes in the offense.

Watkins is W&L’s top gun. He
has made 49 three-pointers. Freshman
John Rogers has made 27, and
Brading has made 21.

The Generals are 5-13 and 2-10
in the ODAC, and Canfield thinks the
team still has a good shot at making
the ODAC tournament. The top eight
teams qualify.

two teams we’re competing with,”’ he
said. “‘We need to keep working hard

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team did not take a full
team to the Mid-South tournament in
Jefferson City, Tennessee, but the
Generals still had a strong showing.

Findlay College of Ohio
captured the team championship, and
W&L finished 5th.

For the second consecutive
tournament, senior Peer Soderberg
swept through his first two matches to
reach the finals in his 177-pound
weight class.

In the final, he led Steve Donat
of Finlay 3-2 heading into the second
period, yet found the match knotted at
three before the final period.
Soderberg took the lead by one and
looked to finish first, yet in the final
seconds, Donat scored the crucial
points that led to his 5-4 victory.

Soderberg hopes to break his
string of bad luck in the next
tournament, but his opponent from
the W&L championships two weeks
ago will be present.

“‘He has been very close to
winning, so He is a little
disappointed,’’ said head coach Gary
Franke. ‘‘But that will just make him
work harder because he has another
challenge this week.”’

Also placing for the Generals
was Eric Shirley, a member of the
promising freshman crop. Shirley
started the day with a loss, but turned
things around in the consolation

MC nabs New York’s Cuomo for keynote address

 

From staff reports

New York Gov. Mario Cuomo will speak
Saturday March 7 at Washington and Lee’s 1992
Mock Democratic Convention.

Cuomo, the perennially sought-after
Democratic presidential candidate who recently
has been mentioned as a write-in candidate in
the New Hampshire Democratic primary, will
deliver the keynote speech at the convention,
according to MC Speakers Chairman Ted Elliott.

‘*His [Cuomo’s] entrance into Mock Con-
vention has raised our expectations for success
to the highest possible level,’’ Elliott said.

Cuomo agreed over the phone last Wednes-
day to appear at MC, Elliott said.

 

 

Cuomo

Cuomo replaces former presidential candi-
date and District of Columbia Shadow Senator
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who pulled out of a
verbal agreement to deliver the keynote speech
two weeks ago. Although Jackson’s decision
came at a late date, Elliott said MC officers were
never worried about finding a replacement.

‘After Jackson backed out, Cuomo was the
obvious choice,’’ Elliott said. ‘“The only reason
we didn’t ask him before was that we thought he

would be a candidate.”’

Cuomo was elected to the New York state-
house in 1984. Although he received national
media attention as a possible presidential candi-
date in both the 1988 and 1992 elections, he has

never formally entered a race.

If adopted, the bill would have
cost the city about $70,000 a year in
lost property-tax revenues, City Man-
ager T. Jon Ellestad said.

“‘The new bill was designed to
protect students from being taxed
twice,’’ he said.

Currently, owners can be taxed
by the city if their cars are garaged in
the city for the majority of the year,
regardless of the state of registration.

Ellestad said the new law would
have allowed Lexington to assess
only cars registered in students’
names. That would have eliminated

Students responded to the impo-
sition of the tax in 1991 by threaten-
ing a boycott of local merchants.

The boycott was called off when
1990-91 EC President Tom Hatcher
stepped in to mediate.

In March 1991, Hatcher told the
City Council students already pay
their fair share of city expenses
through donations by the university.

“This is a blatant attempt to
increase revenue at the expense of
non-constituents,’’ Hatcher said.

But the city proceeded with its
efforts to collect the tax.

passed, the city would have consid-
ered raising the property tax rate to
make up for the lost revenue.

Wilson promises Delt decision during break

IFC votes to support Delt appeal

 

By JASON KELLEY
Phi Editor

 

The  Interfraternity Council
voted overwhelmingly Tuesday night
to support a resolution calling for
Washington and Lee President John
Wilson and the Student Affairs Com-
mittee to reconsider Delta Tau Delta’s
five-year suspension from campus.

The council’s vote came after
Delt President Robert Wilson appeal-
ed to the IFC for help in Delt’s ap-
peal to President Wilson.

Robert Wilson argued that all
the fraternities should be concerned
because SAC’s decision set a bad
precedent for the autonomy of fra-
ternities in the future.

“‘This concerns the sovereignty

of each one of your houses,”’ he said.

IFC President Greg Hicks said
he supports the resolution, in part
because he said SAC did not even
consider the IFC’s recommendation
that Delt be placed on critical proba-
tion after chapter members destroyed
walls and a brick bar in the house.

Three fraternity presidents vol-
unteered to draft the final wording of
the resolution after February break.
The IFC plans to present it to Presi-
dent Wilson and SAC Wednesday
Feb. 26, but President Wilson said
Monday he expects to rule on the
appeal next week.

President Wilson can either
uphold SAC’s decision or send the
case back to SAC with a recommen-
dation to reduce the penalty.

So far, no Washington and Lee
students have tested or reported test-
ing positive for the AIDS virus, but
administrators say it’s just a matter of
time.

““My only concern is that stu-
dents not have a false sense of reas-
surance that it is not a problem
here,”’ said Dr. Jane Horton, universi-
ty physician. ‘‘It is a potential prob-
lem, even without the positive test re-
sults.”’

“I do expect to see a student
with HIV at W&L.”’

According to recent information
from the national Centers for Disease

Control, about 30,000, or one in 400,
American college students have tested
positive for HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS. At that rate, W&L could ex-
pect to have as many as five HIV-
positive students on campus.

Since the university began offer-
ing confidential HIV-antibody testing
in 1988, the Student Health Center
has administered 57 tests, Horton
said. More students requested testing
from the infirmary this fall than have
been tested in any other single year.

Horton said all of the tests have
had negative results.

Horton emphasized that the
health center’s negative results do not
mean that no W&L students are HIV-
positive. She said some students may

not know they are infected and others
may have been tested elsewhere.

According to the ‘‘University
Policy on AIDS,’’ any student or
employee who knows or suspects he
is HIV-positive should notify a uni-
versity physician, counselor or a
member of the Dean of Students
office.

However, Horton said there is
“no guarantee’’ that an HIV-positive
student or employee would reveal his
condition.

The policy also says that HIV-
positive individuals are obligated
“ethically and legally’’ to conduct
themselves responsibly in order to
protect other members of the W&L
community.

According to the policy, infor-
mation about HIV-positive individuals
must be kept confidential. Horton said
the names of HIV-positive individuals
would be revealed to the administra-
tion only if it became necessary for
the health of the infected individuals
or other members of the community.

Although she cannot disclose
the names of infected students, Hor-
ton said she would inform administra-
tors and the student body about the
number of HIV cases on campus.

“‘T would find it reasonable to
report that we have had positive test
results, if we have,’’ Horton said. ‘‘I
would use the opportunity to let peo-
ple know that better prevention and
education were necessary.”’

Che KRing-tum Phi

Founded September 18, 1897

The EC forgot
to follow the rules

The handling of ‘‘Big Four’’ elections this year by the
Executive Committee and Voting Regulations Board has been
slipshod and unconstitutional at best, but lacking practical
accountability to students, not much can be done.

Last week we commented on the sparse notices placed on
campus by the VRB to make students aware of election
deadlines. The VRB made an effort to correct that mistake by
putting up posters reminding students to vote on Monday, but
the damage, after all, was done. The posters essentially
reminded students to vote for Josh MacFarland or Josh
MacFarland for EC president.

MacFarland was elected EC president by 792 of the 1,412
voting students, a majority, but only 56 percent. Of course,
leaders have been elected by narrower margins. But who did
MacFarland narrowly beat? Mickey Mouse?

No, actually the official runner-up was senior B.J. League,
whose name 260 students wrote in. League ran against
MacFarland because no one else did.

Maybe one of the other almost 2,000 students might have
filed a petition to run, but did not know about the deadline.
How could just anyone have known? Unlike MacFarland,
most students do not sit on the EC.

There is an answer to this problem. The student
Constitution demands that any variance from the usual election
dates be published in every Phi in February. But EC President
Giles Perkins said he saw that mandate as more of a guideline
than a requirement.

The constitution does not say anything about guidelines.
All students should be informed, and the writers of the
constitution recognized the Phi as an efficient means of
notification.

Obviously, the constitution intends that elections be held
after February. If scheduling absolutely necessitates a
February election, early publicity is even more important. But
neither the EC nor the VRB published adequate notice of
election dates in the Phi.

The constitution was shrugged off as an inconvenient set
of guidelines, and as a result, a presidential hopeful was kept
out of the race. Consider: 260 students wrote ‘‘B.J. League”’
on their ballots. Not bad for a last-minute word-of-mouth and
poster blitz. How many would have voted for League if her
name had been on the ballot? Two hundred sixty votes for

 

League and 318 ‘‘invalid’’ votes for president indicate not a.
radical, anti-MacFarland movement, but a reasonable cross- |

section of students who would at least like a choice.

Washington and Lee students are not known for their
tendency to rally to a cause. If EC members are waiting for
disgruntled students to storm the University Center demanding
a new election, they had best not wait long. W&L students, on
the other hand, express themselves best when they do not
express themselves, and that is exactly what happened
Monday. About 44 percent of voting students did not vote for
MacFarland. That’s a W&L statement.

The EC is now sailing on the smooth waters of silent
dissent. It will not act, as elected officials do not respond well
to silent criticism.

We do not claim that MacFarland will not make a good EC
president or that he is not qualified for the job. Our objection
is to a student government that has become so distant from its
constituency and so insensitive to student apathy, that it no
longer fears being held accountable by students. The student
government believes it can go about its business, interpreting
the constitution in whatever way is convenient, and no one,
except sometimes the Phi, will raise a fuss.

And maybe they are right.

Don’t vote! Our

By Niall MacKenzie, ’93

 

Because the people who own the United States have
never much liked the idea of democracy, we have no such
thing. Our political apparatus and its obedient servant, the
media, are tailored to keep the American people as ignorant
of and unengaged in public decision-making as the people
possibly can be. For the most part, they succeed. But every
once in a while some issue comes up that cannot be skirted;
much to the irritation of our corporate owners and their
lackeys in politics and journalism, the people do have to be
made aware of a few issues of national concen. Supreme
Court nominations are one example. Presidential elections

are another,

LET IT RIDE

By Chris Swann

 

Being the English scholar that I am, I’ve
been pondering the mysteries of life over the
past few weeks. Like, what is the mystical force
that removes an article of clothing from my
possession every time I do my laundry? The
keys to the universe, as Bruce Springsteen says,
can be found in the engine of an old parked car,
so maybe I’ll find something in these musings.

A friend of mine was asked to describe
a Jewish nose, and he pointed at mine. Gee,
wouldn’t my old-fashioned Protestant grandpar-
ents be thrilled. ‘‘All right, where did your nose
come from? Who did it? It was Uncle Bernie,
wasn’t it? I knew he was Jewish!’’ Perhaps I’ll
touch off a minor religious war amidst my
family. And what exactly is a Jewish nose? Call
me meshugenah, but I thought it was a mean
stereotype directed at Barbara Striesand.

I want to print something from the ‘‘greatest
writer of English literature,’’ John Milton:

They who.to states and governors of the

that?

Are the Star Trek guys getting older, or is it
just me? In the last movie I kept waiting for
Spock’s ears to fall off or McCoy’s dentures to

body please give him an acting lesson! ‘‘Bones,
this... man is (head jerk) DEAD. Givemearead-
ing. Spock, is there... anythingsuspiciousonthe-

like an accomplished Shakespearian.

 

I’ve been pondering the great
mysteries of life over the past
few weeks... Why can’t we all be
sophomores and live in a
pre-CRC world?

 

I think cartoonists are the sickest people on
the planet. Charlie Brown has this obsession
with a red-headed girl we never see. It’s proba-
bly mom, who, incidentally, never appears
either. Are there no adults inthis world? There

are none except those voices that sound like Jimi °

with doubt of what will be the success, others
with fear of what will be the censure; some with
hope, others with confidence of what they have

And that is the opening sentence. What
would your teachers do if you wrote this? Run
it through a grammar checker: ‘‘extremely
lengthy, sentence fragments,’’ perhaps? My

Kevlar? Sure, every time you asked that in grade
school, some fat kid with glasses said it was
because Vader fell into a volcano and needed it

megaphone. And have you seen those people
DANCE? Take a look at Garfield — does Jon
have a life outside of this fat, lasagna-eating cat?
And nobody can tell me that Odie doesn’t have
serious problems. How about Calvin — he’s
been six years old for the past decade. He makes
Dennis the Menace look well-adjusted. I’m not
even going to mention Gary Larson.

Would somebody explain to me why there
are no caramel Twix candy bars in the Co-op
anymore? Oh sure, I can have Oreo Cookie,
Peanut Butter, or (shudder) Chocolate Fudge.
What are they trying to do, get me to buy anoth-
er brand of candy bar? My snack of choice,
vanished. Life is so unfair.

Why do freshmen always look completely
lost? Why do seniors always look anxious
around May? Why do both envy the other?

Why, oh why, do I go to the Palms? Let’s
examine this alcohol concept. About 10,000
years ago, some prehistoric neanderthal grew
some wheat, stomped on it with his muddy feet,
boiled it in water for days with some yeast and
drank it. Anybody want a beer?

Why can’t we all just be sophomores and
live in a pre-CRC world?

dent time, and the lurid
daytime-drama-like preoc-
cupations which will crowd out all meaningful discussion
in the coming months are already being whipped-up by the
media.

A supermarket tabloid called The Star got the fun off
to a start, weighing-in recently with a rivetting story about
Bill Clinton’s alleged colorful history of extramarital
amusements, Outwardly indignant but inwardly grateful, the
mainstream press was quick to lap up this gift from its ma-
ligned colleague. There ensued a general flurry of excited
chatter about propriety and privacy and the rest of it —

with a good deal of, ‘‘Do you think he really, you know,

Miss America?”’ thrown in.

It is hypocritical for mainstream media organizations
to condemn rags like The Star for their contemptible sleaze-
mongering. For these rags are only taking to its logical
extreme the very tone of public discourse which the
mainstream media has set. The race for nominations has, to
date, been characterized by a general swapping of brainless
catch-phrases (‘‘twinkie economics’’) and childish outbursts
(‘jumping all over my you-know-what’’). This insults both
the people’s intelligence and the lofty tradition of American
political discourse. Sadly, as competition for the presidency
heats up, we can only expect this trend to intensify, with
the added spice of some more irrelevant personal innuen-
does, All this is part of a general scramble by the manufac-
turers and dispensers of opinion to divert attention away
from the reality of our political life. U.S. politics has
degenerated into a mephitic kindergarten, completely empty
of meaning or dignity. Se as carnin |
__ What to do? Electronic media have certainly abetted
the forces of diversion in public discourse. America’s
attention span is presently something like 9.8 seconds, just
the length of an average campaign-trail ‘‘sound-bite.’’ We
might try to control the damage by banning all paid
political ads and giving all candidates equal time to express
their views on radio and TV. This might force them to
convey some impression of what and how well — and if —
they actually think. We might also join the civilized world
in limiting election campaigns to eight weeks, in hopes of
preventing the worst excesses of smearing and trivia-hyping
which currently prevail in our camival-like presidential
lotteries.

These suggestions are insanely optimistic and, even if
they were not, they are limited in their potential to actually
affect so decadent a state of affairs as this one. If you really
want to do something, don’t vote. Voting in American
elections is no longer merely a waste of time, it is immoral.
It lends an aura of legitimacy to a totally corrupt and
undemocratic system.

Half the people currently eligible to vote have clued
in... and don’t. If that proportion can be swelled to 75 or 80
or 90 percent, then the collapse of the American state’s
legitimacy will be ostentatious and undeniable. Its imperial
directives can be ignored, as they should be, and its
political officers can be dismissed, as they should be. And
then maybe, just maybe, the American people can come
together to rethink and re-order a government which has
never, in recent memory, been by or for them, but only of.

My VIEW

By James Lake

 

You know the PC-types have gone too far
when Time starts busting on ’em.

A cover story in the Feb. 3 issue of that
magazine brought home how far the forces of polit-
ical correctness have taken this country.

“The Fraying of America,’’ moaned Time as
it launched a self-proclaimed ‘‘scorching look at
political correctness, social breakdown and the
culture of complaint.’’ Readers more accustomed to
Time’s customary not-quite-conservative views no
doubt were shocked to read gems such as this:

Americans are obsessed with the recognition,
praise and, when necessary, the manufacture of
victims. ... The range of victims available 10 years
ago — blacks, Chicanos, Indians, women, homosex-
uals — has now expanded to include every permu-
tation of the halt, the blind and the short, or, to put
it correctly, the vertically challenged.

Wow! Is Ayn Rand really dead? Or is she
hiding out somewhere with a modem, using it to
sneak stuff into Time’s computers?

No, probably not. What is happening, one can
only hope, is that PC-stormtroopers are waking up
to the evil they have wrought. Even those with a
permanent tilt to port must see something ridicu-
lous in a banner recently unfurled at the University
of Michigan: ‘‘I used to be a white American but
I gave it up in the interest of humanity.’’

Hopefully, whatever good sense flowed into
Time’s editorial offices this month will soon waft
its way to the Valley of Virginia. With W&L’s
harassment policy under review by the Student
Affairs Committee and the Confidential Review
Committee, this would be an ideal time for our
school to break away from the PC pack.

There’s a lot wrong with the current harass-
ment policy, but Time’s article points to one partic-

ular flaw: its glorification of ‘‘victim’’ groups.
W&L’s policy lashes out at, among other things,
conduct of a ‘‘racial, ethnic, religious or sexual na-
ture’’ that has the ‘‘purpose or effect’’ of ‘‘ad-
versely affecting an individual’s quality of life.”’

I’ve never understood why W&L adopted this
bureaucratic-sounding, group-based code, particu-
larly since it supplanted a far simpler rule — a rule
adopted by one of our founders and thus far more
respected by students than something that reads like
an import from the University of Michigan.

I’m referring, of course, to President Lee’s
simple rule that every student must be a gentleman.

How novel! How simple! But, oh, how incor-
rect!

Well, if we could — for a moment — forgive
Lee for being a dead, white male, maybe we could
see the virtue in his policy and why it should be
restored as the standard for student conduct.

More than a century after Lee’s presidency
ended, W&L retains a commitment to courtesy. Of
course this is not the school’s only mission; W&L
recognizes the importance of conveying information
from faculty to students, and our school, like many
others, performs that task ably.

But Lee’s maxim reminds us of another W&L
goal: teaching civility, a virtue valuable both for its
own sake and because it makes life easier and, con-
sequently, nourishes scholarship. For those reasons,
W&L would be a far better place if we shelved the
current policy in favor of a coeducational version
of the instruction Lee gave nearly 13 decades ago:
“*Students, behave as ladies and gentlemen,”’

Among the greatest strengths of Lee’s stan-
dard is that it doesn’t list attributes, such as race or
religion, that are protected. Such lists, though well
intended, are laden with liabilities.

* First, such lists stigmatize women and listed
minorities by implying those persons are in need of
special protection and are thus inferior to a benevo-
lent, coddling majority.

* Second, such lists deflect attention away
from individuals and toward particular groups; this
focus on groups implies the policy is designed to
protect only members of those groups, not anyone
who is harassed.

* Third, such lists necessarily incite debate
over who merits protection; the more important
question — whether W&L students should behave
like jerks — is neglected.

¢ And, finally, such lists direct attention
toward a symptom and away from the problem —
ungentlemanly conduct. Remember, teaching
civility is one of our school’s central missions, In
Striving for that goal, Lee was telling his students
to behave as gentlemen in all circumstances, not
just when they might get caught ‘‘adversely affect-
ing an individual’s quality of life.’’

WA&L students and employees must have the
Opportunity to express bold ideas without fear of
reprisal. But that is not the only fear W&L must
prevent: the school also cannot allow its students to
live in fear of emotional harm. It is the university’ s

A
'

duty to provide an academic setting free from '

harassment. Fortunately, free speech and freedom
from fear can be protected without stigmatizing

individuals, without bureaucratic codes and without.’

trampling student autonomy.

And the restoration of Lee’s maxim to a place

of prominence would do more than that, Frequent
reference to his advice would further one of this
school’s central missions — producing civil, courte-
Ous men and women.

Because requiring gentlemanly conduct would °

both protect current students from harassment and
perpetuate W&L’s legacy of honor and Civility, I
hope those reviewing the harassment policy will
find a minute or two to consider Lee’s simple
advice — even though he is a dead, white male.

Election breaks
the constitution

Members of the Student Body:

I am writing to express my concern regard-
ing the Executive Committee elections held this
past Monday, Feb. 10, 1992. I believe that the
date of this election has been changed in a man-
ner that is unacceptable in regards the student
body constitution. The constitution, in reference
to elections, states:

By the ninth Monday after January 1 of
each year, a petition with the signatures of 150
students shall be required from every candidate
for President, Vice President and Secretary of the
Student Body. The election shall be held on the
tenth Monday, and the runoff election on the
Thursday of that week.

However, the constitution does provide for
a change in election dates:

In January of each year, if the Executive
Committee determines that the school schedule
will interfere with winter or spring elections, on
a two-thirds vote, the voting dates may be altered
from that contained in this Constitution. Notice of
such change shall be posted in February, and
shall be published in every Ring-tum Phi issued
during February that year.

Eminently obvious is that if the date of the
election is changed, than ample notice, i.e., all
four issues of The Ring-tum Phi issued in Febru-
ary, will announce this change. Again, the obvi-
ous conclusion is that the new date must be after
February. This is certainly not what happened this
year and why I therefore think that the election
this past Monday was unconstitutional.

Given this irregularity in constitutional
governance, I hereby ask the Executive Commit-
tee of Washington and Lee University to forfeit
the results of this week’s election and to resched-
ule a new election in accordance with the student
body constitution. I also ask the students on the
campus in Lexington to join me in this request. I
ask this because I believe that nothing less than
the self-governance of the W&L student, body is
at stake. We have a wonderful heritage of inde-
pendence and self-rule. We take that upon our-
selves by living with a certain set of rules, both
in the constitution and the Honor Code.If we fail
to live by the rules we set for ourselves, how can
we possibly live in the rules imposed by society?
How can we possibly ask others to believe in our
word, which is, after all, only bound by the rules
of honor we each individually provide for our-
selves? So again, I ask you, A NEW ELECTION,
PLEASE!

Ladies and gentlemen, one more word of
warning, if you will permit me. Do not let this
test of our student community relinquish your
commitment to Washington and Lee. Rather, let
it redouble your efforts to make W&L the best
place it can be... the best place to be. Let this be
your inspiration to make Washington and Lee the
most wonderful place anybody associated with it
can possibly think of.

With that, I leave you with thoughts of
rectification, reconciliation and, next fall, matric-
ulation.

Sincerely,
Niv Goldberg, ’93

MacKenzie tires
irate law student

To the Editor:

I, for one, am sick and tired of reading Mr.
Niall MacKenzie’s smug, left-wing potshots in
this space. While the Phi is indeed.a forum for
the expression of student views, it is assuredly
not a bulletin board for gratuitous personal
attacks, such as those which appeared in the two

. most recent issues of this publication.
Mr. MacKenzie evidently revels in his self-

 

- OPINION

LETTERS

proclaimed glory as the liberal ‘‘campus wit.’’
(Unfortunately, he has a lot of competition.)
What self-deluded arrogance he showed in attack-
ing a Phi story before it was published! His
deficient omniscience was happily exposed by the
Phi’s objective coverage of Mrs. Thatcher’s
speech, which appeared the same day as his
cocksure prediction. Mr. MacKenzie must, no
doubt, be red-faced at such a glaring demonstra-
tion of his lack of insight.

As for the merits (if any) of Mr. Mac-
Kenzie’s latest diatribe: the Spectator is merely
engaging in something which is apparently
foreign to Mr. MacKenzie; humor. Mr. Mac-
Kenzie’s feeble sense of humor seems to be
confined to shrill attacks on ‘‘the way things
are.”’ Like a frustrated child who cannot have his
way, he tilts at windmills, hoping the world will
turn in his direction instead of that which the rest
of us have chosen.

Mr. MacKenzie takes perverse pleasure in
using strident language to further his marginal
viewpoints. He hopes to ‘‘prick our conscience”’
by reminding us of the alleged misery of the
fraternity maintenance staffs. I am certain that his
condescending words have done little to invoke
a sense of remorse in anyone. Certainly the
maintenance staffs work hard at their jobs; at the
same time, fraternity members are entitled to
receive full value for what they spend.

Let us not forget, Mr. MacKenzie, that
limousine liberals like you are constantly shriek-
ing about economic inequality. At the same time,
you enjoy a significantly higher standard of living
than those you claim to care about. It is the
height of hypocrisy to demand that the Spectator
check its sense of humor at the door, while you
reap the benefits of the fraternity system yourself.

The Spectator is a harmless and humorous
magazine. Recognize it as such, lighten up and
enjoy it.

Yours, etc.,
Mitch Neurock, ’92L

YAWP article
bashes Sig Ep

The following letter was sent to the Phi in re-
sponse to an article in YAWP magazine.

To Bill Alberque:

I have read your article ‘‘Fraternity ‘Ren-
aissance’ or ‘Swan Song’’’ that was printed in a
recent issue of the YAWP that is periodically
distributed on our campus. I enjoyed having
Democratic and liberal views in print until. your
story unpleasantly crossed my path. _

First of all, many houses on campus may
seem as if they were ‘‘in trouble’’ of closing.
One of the factors that you seemed to be refer-
ring to that could lead to the end of a chapter
was pledge class size. I agree that it can influence
whether or not a house will ‘‘fold,’’ but I think
that quality also plays an important role. Many
fraternities on campus have gotten quality pledge
classes while receiving quantity at the same time,
and they have remained one of your ‘‘thirteen
hot-spots.’’ Of the three houses you named in
your article, Sigma Phi Epsilon needed a large,
strong pledge class most of all. Well, sir, they
succeeded. However, we are still hearing deroga-
tory remarks made toward us. For insiance, our
pledge class act was booed at Lip Synch; some of
the people that didn’t think Sig Ep would or
should be around much longer are thinking again.

As you have probably noticed, I have a lot
of pride in my fraternity; the rest of the pledges
and brothers do, too. I think that we have reason
to be proud, but you are entitled to your own
opinion. Let me ask you how you formed your
opinions. Do you know any other Sig Eps besides

  

 

John Flippen? Do you know any of the pledges?
My pledge brothers were not thrilled upon read-
ing your article, as I am sure my friends in the
other two houses you mentioned were not.

I, sir, also consider myself a Democrat, and
a liberal. However, I consider myself to be open-
minded, and I try not to prejudge others. It is a
fault that everyone has, but some do not publish
such views for all W&L to see. Be careful, you
may even be friends with someone that you not
only get along with, but even respect; he may be
a Sig Ep.

Concerned,

John W. Cox

YAWP writer
clarifies position

To the Editor:

Several weeks ago, an article of mine was
published in the new magazine, YAWP. This
article has caused a good deal of confusion and
consternation. I wish to clarify several points.

1. Regarding Sig Ep, my remarks were
meant to highlight two things:

a. Sig Ep’s class of 1992 has shown |
remarkable leadership qualities for the past four
years. Now it’s graduating. Where do they go
from here?

b. Over the past two years, justice has
come down hard upon bottle throwers and bar
disassemblers. I still find it remarkable that the
administration’s own ‘‘angel of death’’ passed
over Sig Ep after last year’s shotgun and interna-
tional drug trafficking incidents. Is it really so
outlandish to suggest that the class of ’92’s
leadership quotient had something to do with it?
You make the call.

2. Regarding Phi Delt, sorry, fellas, but the
stain of the Scarborough incident has yet to wash
off. We’re the last class that will remember the
incident itself, and, quite frankly, it has yet to be
fully exorcised. Perhaps nobody noticed Comer’s
disappearance that night, I really don’t know. I
don’t think that new, extraordinary action needs
to be taken, but I would like to hear what the
senior Phi Delts think of the whole thing; after
all, it is they who have been cheated of her
company for the past four years. Her memory
may go with us, but the stain remains firmly on
Phi Delt.

3. Several houses have started with the
closed party business. I didn’t name a particular
name so that everyone would have a different
idea as to what particular fraternity I meant.
Judging from the reactions, it worked. Now let’s
open up those damn parties again. s

’ 4, I consider myself neither a Democrat nor
a liberal. While I am grateful to YAWP for pub-
lishing my (I thought complementary) views on
fraternities, I must reiterate my ideological dis-
tance. I remain, as I’ve always been, a political
and economic hard-line conservative.

Sincerely,
William P. Alberque

Honor wears a changing face

 

By FRANCESCA KEFALAS
Phi Entertainment Editor

“The Honor System is not ours to do
with as we please; it is ours only to pre-
serve,”’

— Sidney M. B. Coulling, ’46, in the
1961 Alumni Magazine

The idea of honor has been around a
long time at Washington and Lee, in fact
since before Lee came here. But the meaning
of honor has not always been the same.

Honor in the pre-Lee years was more
like an honor among thieves, according to
Professor of History and University Historian
Taylor Sanders.

Sanders said there was basically a war
between the faculty and the students, and the
only way for the faculty to exercise control
of student conduct was with pages and pages
of rules. Those rules included no dancing, no
nicknames and no leaving the campus with-
out permission.

According to Ollinger Crenshaw’s
General Lee’s College, the Washington
College faculty in 1853 decided that conduct
would count as one-sixth of a student’s
standing.

When Lee arrived in 1865, he ended
the student-faculty battles.

Crenshaw said the once strict discipline
of the college was replaced by ‘‘a gentle-
manly, lofty code of conduct.’’ Lee stressed
the importance of acting honorably and hav-
ing self-respect.

“The main thing that stops students
from cheating,’’ Sanders said, ‘‘is the mutu-
ality of respect between the faculty and
students, and the Honor System supports
that.’” But even Lee had some disciplinary
problems with students. In 1870, two stu-
dents were suspended for disorderly conduct
and intoxication in a Lexington hotel. The
students were not readmitted until they

LOW PRICES!

 

 

Whole Smoked
Picnic

signed a pledge stating they would avoid vio-
lating school law. The practice of the honor
pledge had begun.

Sanders said that generally, the Honor
System of Lee’s time was very informal, and
could be because of the small size of the
student body. If a student was suspected of
an honor violation, a student body meeting
would be called in the chapel. If the students
agreed he was guilty, he was forced to with-
draw.

Sanders said the student body started
electing officials about 1906 or 1907. As the
school grew in size, the need for a more
formal student government grew, and the
Executive Committee came to be. By the
1920s, the EC as we know it existed.

Sanders said he once heard a story he
believes set the tone for the Honor System.

Soon after Robert P. Doremus donated
a large sum of money to W&L, Sanders
says, Doremus found himself riding home on
a train with a W&L student who had just
been forced to withdraw for an honor vio-
lation. The young man expressed his regret
to Doremus, who wrote a letter to the univer-
sity president.

Doremus asked the president to accept
the young man back at W&L, Sanders says.
The president responded that he could not
possibly do that, as the student body made
its decision.

The codification of the Honor system is
harder pin point. The Ring-tum Phi consulted
numerous sources and none could give a date
for the writing of the first White Book.

The strength of the Honor System has
always surprised many visitors.

According to a January, 1925 Alumni
Magazine, the Citadel football team was
shocked to see the boxes of apples left unat-
tended in the hallway of the gymnasium. The
price of the apples was on a card and next to
the card was a box in which to leave the
money, and sure enough there wasymoney in

  

   

 

 

the box.

Chavis was first

 

By JOYCE BAUTISTA
Phi Staff Reporter

 

In winter term 1795, John Chavis became

| Liberty Hall Academy’s first black student. But

there wouldn’t be another until 1966.

“‘Legend has it that Chavis was the object
of [a bet between] two planters on whether or
not an African could be educated, and the one
who thought Chavis couldn’t [be educated]
lost,’’ visiting Proiessor of History Ted DeLaney
said Monday at a lecture honoring Black History
Month.

After leaving the academy, Chavis became
a widely respected Presbyterian minister, teach-
ing at his own private school in North Carolina,

In 1988, Michael J. McManus, father of DeLaney said.

a W&L student and a syndicated columnist,
was pleasantly surprised to find that his son’s
lost wallet was retuned to him with $15
dollars in it, according to a February 1988
Alumni Magazine. McManus subsequently
wrote about the honor and integrity of W&L
in a column.

Sometimes belief in the Honor System
spread to those who didn’t attend W&L. The
Alumni Magazine of September 1974 report-
ed that the widow of a 1923 graduate had
found and sent back a book her husband had
checked out of the W&L library and subse-
quently lost — 50 years before.

However, apparent disregard for the
Honor System by students does happen.

A June 1954 Alumni Magazine in 1954,
15 students were brought before the Execu-
tive Committee for involvement in a cheating
ring.

The students had in their possession
pass keys to all the offices in Newcomb,
Payne, Washington, Robinson and Reid halls.
They also had a key to the Buildings and
Grounds Superintendent’s office where all
the university keys were kept, including the
key to the file cabinet where tests were kept
until professors picked them up.

Almost all of the students involved
withdrew voluntarily rather than stand trial,
and all signed statements indicating their part
in the cheating ring. A night watchman was
also involved in the cheating ring and was
immediately fired.

Throughout the years the Honor System
has been tested and re-examined again and
again.

“It might be that such an atmosphere
of trust and honor is rarer in the world today
than ever before,” former university Presi-
dent Robert E.R. Huntley said. ‘‘If so, it is
even more to be cherished and coveted
among us here.’’

DeLaney, who was a lab assistant in the
W&L biology department from 1963 to 1983,
spoke on ‘‘John Chavis: A Man Caught Between
Freedom and Slavery.”’

In 1964, when the issue of integration was
sweeping across the country, W&L remained an
all-white university. The issue of desegregation
was the hottest topic for debate in The Ring-tum
Phi.

Dr. Edward L. Pinney, then associate pro-
fessor of political science, said in a February
1964 issue of the Phi that ‘‘according to an
official in the W&L administration, a Negro has
never applied to the college.’’ Pinney suggested
that ‘‘were such an application made, it might
serve as a catalyst to decision on the part of the
Board of Trustees.”’

Some readers of the Phi claimed that since
no black students ever applied to W&L, that
there was no policy of segregation.

Ed Rodman, president of the student body
at the all-black school Hampton, told the Phi in
1964 that ‘‘no high school graduate who is a
Negro particularly wants to be a ‘firster’ at a
formerly all-white college.’’

Rodman said if he wanted to attend an
integrated university his first choice would be a
one that has already addressed the ‘integration
issue problem.

“Intelligent Negroes from any high school
can gain admission to Dartmouth, Princeton,
Bowdoin or Amherst, where they can pursue
their academic interest without the pressure of
white racists,’’ he said.

DeLaney said many of the arguments used
by the advocates of segregation were similar to
those used to fight W&L’s 1985 shift to coedu-
cation. For example, he said, one argument
against integration asked the question, ‘‘Where
are they going to go to the bathroom?’’

“They didn’t know what to do,’” DeLaney
said, “‘because at the time the South was still
full of separate bathrooms for blacks and
whites,”’

Finally, in 1966 two black students, the
first since Chavis, enrolled at W&L.

But the fifteen black students of the class
of 1974 were the first sizable class of black
graduates.

“‘They were a very impressive group of
students,’’ Professor of Politics Lewis John, who
was dean of students from 1969 to 1990 said.
“They were determined to succeed.”’

John said the black students had some
“‘initial social difficulties because of the relative-
ly small black community in Lexington and the
surrounding women’s colleges.’’

Because black students were coming into
a traditionally white-upper-middle-class universi-
ty from historically black high schools, they had
to struggle academically early on, according to
John. He said that through extra studying they
caught up with their white peers.

**All the students were admitted for their
potential and ability,’’ John said. ‘‘The addition
of black students to W&L went fairly smooth-
ly.”

Today there are several organized opportu-
nities for blacks, other ethnic minorities and
whites to interact with one another, Associate
Dean of Students Anece McCloud said. She
cited Una Vox as one example.

“‘T and several others thought we needed a
paper on campus that filled the gap of bringing
together news of diverse groups on campus,”’
McCloud said, ‘‘especially those groups that
may not be covered by other campus publica-
tions,”’

The Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble will bring a new kind of
performance to the Lenfest Center

Dance ensemble
appeals to many

 

By LAKEISHA TOWNES
Phi Staff Reporter

 

If you’ve been hungering for a
different kind of cultural excitement,
check out the Alvin Ailey Repertory
Ensemble, a modern dance group per-
forming at the Lenfest Center on
February 27.

Lenfest Theatre Director Mi-
chael Gorman said he is ‘‘very
pleased that this group is coming.”’
He said he feels the performance will
appeal to a variety of interests. As
evidence, he cited the speed with
which the performance has sold out.

The dancers in the ensemble are
students picked from New York Ci-
ty’s Alvin Ailey American Dance
Center, which was established in
1974. The center and the dance group

are named for their creator and ren-

owned «choreographer, “Alvin Ailey, ©

‘who died in December 1989.
After Ailey’s death, the group

Have a happy and safe

Was

hington's break!

looked to Sylvia Waters for direction.
Ms. Waters, a former principal dancer
for the company, has been the Artistic
Director of the esemble since its for-
mation.

Although the company has been
predominately black, Waters stands
behind Ailey’s goal of having an
integrated company. Ailey wanted to
avoid categorizing ‘‘any one kind of
person,’’ he said, because there is
only ‘‘good dance and bad dance.”’
And the ensemble exemplifies good
dance.

The group may perform ‘*Work-
out,’’ an athletic ballet choreagraphed
by Louis Johnson and performed to
contemporary music. Other pieces
include ‘‘Isba,’’ choreographed by
Alvin Ailey, and ‘Hunger and
Thirst,’’ which was choreographed by
Kathryn Posin.

* Gortnan said he hopes this’ per-
formance ‘‘will be the beginning of
more dance programs.”’

Cupid is coming

 

By NICOLE KEELER
Phi Staff Reporter

Contrary to popular marketing myth, Valentine’s Day was not created by
Hallmark in order to increase greeting card sales. Even die-hard romantics are
often ignorant about the rich history of St. Valentine’s Day.

The holiday harks back to ancient Rome, where teenage boys paid homage
to the lusty god Lupercus by drawing the names of single girls from a box,
according to Charles Panati’s Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things. The
boy and girl were then considered a couple for the rest of the year, until the
next drawing.

But when Christianity spread across the Roman Empire, the Catholic
Church found that its newly converted populace wanted to hang onto its pagan
ritual, Panati says. So the Pope decided to offer people a Christian substitute:
the story of St. Valentine.

According to the church, Valentine was a young priest during the reign
of the mad Roman Emperor Claudius, Panati says. Claudius believed that
marriage and love weakened the fighting spirit of the people. And since he
couldn’t outlaw love, Claudius outlawed marriage.

Panati says that in response, the heartbroken Valentine secretly invited

-young lovers to his home, where he married them. When Claudius discovered

this, he had Valentine arrested. While he was in jail, Valentine fell in love
with the prison keeper’s daughter, Asterius. Knowing that his martyrdom was
inevitable, the young priest wrote his love a letter, signing it, ‘‘From Your
Valentine.”’

Variations on this legend have come down to the present day. And now
couples celebrate the holiday of love by exchanging gifts like flowers, choco-
lates and a card or ‘‘Valentine.”’

The Superdance Committee takes a moment out of Superdance clean-up to pose for the camera.

MD Superdance tops last year by $3,000

 

By SEBASTIAN CROSS
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee’s 14th
annual Superdance raised $30,240 for
the Muscular Dystrophy Administra-
tion, surpassing last year’s take of
$27,000.

This year the money was raised
in the name of name of five-year-old
Andrew Slay, the son of Richmond

alumnus Joe Slay, ’72. Andrew suf-
fers from Spinal Muscular Atrophy,
one of the 40 strains of Muscular
Dystrophy and the leading killer of
children under two-years-old.

Fred Renneker, Superdance co-
chairman, said he was pleased with
the results.

‘‘All organizations involved
were extremely helpful and
supportive of the cause,’’ he said.

Mock Con students target
local businesses for blitz

 

By JAMESON LEONARDI
Phi Staff Reporter

The 1992 Washington and Lee
Mock Convention launched a public
relations blitz on the downtown mer-
chants last week.

MC Public Relations Co-Chair-
man Courtney Hall said the PR Blitz
was suggested by Dianne Herrick,
chairman of the Lexington Downtown
Development Association.

‘*We thought that students going
around to the local merchants and
explaining what MC was would be a

 

good idea,’’ Herrick said.

The original plan was to leave
brochures at the Visitor’s Center for
people to pick up, Hall said.

But Herrick had a better idea.

‘*Mrs. Herrick thought it would
be a nice touch for students to go to
each store individually and give them
the brochures,’’ Hall said.

“‘We wanted to be noticeable, so
everyone wore red, white, and blue,”’
Hall said.

‘IT think it was a huge success,”’
Hall said. ‘“The local merchants were
very responsive and very supportive.”’

‘‘We wanted to initiate those

“*We didn’t make any rules that

Atkins said Robert Wilson told

Pavilion Manager Taylor Crot-

Bill Meadows, the lead singer of

been a major reason for low turnout.

Publications Board
removes Calyx editor

 

By CATHY LOPICCOLO
Phi News Editor

 

Senior Pete Trammell was re-
moved from his positions as Calyx
co-editor and Publications Board
member after the Pub Board voted 4-
0 Monday night that he had not ful-
filled his duties.

The board recommended that
Trammell hold a lesser position on
the Calyx staff, such as assistant edi-
tor. Board President Rick Peltz would
not comment on the specific reasons
behind the Pub Board vote, he said,
because all board discussions about
personnel are closed.

Neither Trammell nor Calyx
Editor Kelli Klick were present at
Monday’s meeting, and no Calyx
representative voted.

Peltz said he and Vice President
Tonya Yoder, Ariel editor, were ap-
pointed to talk to Trammell and Klick
about the board’s vote and to decide
if the recommendation should stand.

“‘We were concerned because
Kelli [Klick] was not able to be at the
meeting and expressed a desire to talk
to us about it,’’ Peltz said. ‘‘The

board wanted to hear if she had a
compelling reason not to remove
Trammell.”’

After talking to Trammell and
Klick, Peltz said he and Yoder decid-
ed the board’ s

ice
™ should be
carried out.

Klick
said she
will not
appoint a
new co-
editor and
that Tram-
mell will
remain ‘‘an
integral
member’’

 

Trammell

of the staff.

‘‘Right now, I’m still working
with Pete as a co-editor,’’ Klick said.
“*Pete has my full support.’’

Trammell declined to comment.

In other business, the Pub Board
is now accepting applications for
1992-93 editors and business manag-
ers for Calyx, The Ring-tum Phi,

cal Review.

Perkins defends EC actions,
election’s constitutionality

 

v ELECT continued from page 1

 

February.”

A student who believed that sec-
tion of the constitution would prohibit
a February election called the matter
to the attention of EC President Giles
Perkins.

“That’s clearly not what the
constitution says to me,’’ Perkins
said. ‘‘It says that we have to have
the elections ‘by’ the 10th week of
term, and that we can alter the dates.
That’s the way we chose to interpret
it, and it is a valid interpretation.”’

Perkins said the election. dates
were changed due to conflicts with
both Mock Convention and Fancy
Dress.

“‘We were faced with a situation
this year when there was no other
block of three weeks in which to hold
the election,’’ Perkins said.

Dean of Students David Howison,
chairman of the Student Affairs
Committee, said he reads that section
of the constitution as a guideline,
rather than as a prohibition.

“IT do not think [the constitution]
bans a February election; they just
need to make notice of it in the Phi,”’
Howison said.

Howison said he assumes the EC
approved the dates by a two-thirds

vote. But EC Secretary Caroline |

Wight said she was not sure that such
a vote was taken.

During the Jan. 20 EC meeting,
the committee discussed the election
dates, Wight said. At that time, Per-

kins gave the tentative dates, subject
to approval from the Voting Regula-
tions Board, she said.

““Even if we didn’t vote officially,
I can honestly say there was a unani-
mous agreement on the date,’’ Wight
said. ‘‘There was no dissent at all.
We all sat there with calendars to
work it out.’’

The EC submitted a ‘General
Note’’ on the Big 4 election to the
Phi in January, and that note ap-
peared on Jan. 23. There was no
mention of elections in the Jan. 30
Phi. In the Feb. 6 Phi, elections were
covered as news, and a General Note
reminding students to vote was added
by a Phi editor. There was no sub-
mission of notice of elections by the
EC or the VRB for the Feb. 6 Phi.

Perkins said the constitutional
questions would not affect the elec-
tion’s results.

Senior B.J. League, who began a
write-in campaign for EC president
after she found out that only one
candidate was running, said she will
not protest the election.

**‘Josh [MacFarland] won fair and
square,’’ League said. ‘‘But I hope
future elections are taken a little more
seriously and run properly. I was ...
[disappointed] to learn that there was
even a question as to the constitution-
ality of this election.”’

While MacFarland sau! he was
upset by the early election dates, he
agreed with the EC’s reasoning.

“*March being such a busy month,
I don’t know when else it could have
been held,’’ MacFarland said.

Local woman arrested at pavilion, later charged with arson

 

 

dent gave him the impression that it
was some ‘‘silly kind of stuff.”’

Robert Wilson said the initiation
ceremony is confidential, but nothing
harmful or dangerous occurred.

**There was never any question
of risk,’’ he said. ‘‘Nothing happened
that risked life or limb. . . [or] that
compromised anyone’s morals or
values.”

woman was brought there to be held until she
sobered up and could be released.

Yeager said the woman put a mattress on the
floor, stuffed toilet paper around it, and lit it with
matches.

She was then charged with arson, he said.

No W&L security officers were assigned to
the pavilion that night, but officer Joseph Pelter
said he was called to go there at about 12:45 a.m.
because the woman refused to leave after being

asked to by the people in charge of the party.

Pelter said he called the Lexington Police for
backup before he went to the pavilion.

The pavilion was rented out for that night to
an individual by Assistant Dean of Students Leroy
C. ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins. Atkins would not give the
person’s name and said he did not know the nature
of the event. He said the pavilion is rented for
private events whenever possible ‘‘in order to keep
the cost of student events down.”’

to initate anyone.’’The chapter gave Phi Staff Reporter

the pledges the choice to initiate,
Robert Wilson said, and only two
decided to remain pledges while awa-
iting the appeal.

Delt did not break any rules by

second-half surge pulls Generals past Hornets

Rogers followed Watkins with a
three-pointer of his own, and
Lynchburg was forced to take another
time-out.

“If those shots don’t fall, it’s a
completely different game,’’ Watkins
said. ‘‘Luckily, they went in.’’

After Dooms scored, W&L
spread the floor and Newton went
back-door for a lay-up, and the
Generals hit their free throws down
the stretch to hold on for the win.

In the second half, W&L forced
Lynchburg into just 29 percent
shooting and held their own on the
boards.

NOTEBOOK

 

Washington and Lee sent
some of its top track and field
performers to New England and
saw three individuals place in
the meet at Williams College.

On the men’s side, junior
Bo Hannah won the 3,000-
meters and freshman Grant
Cowell finished third in the 800-
meters.

On the women’s side,
freshman Sarah Gilbert scored
enough points by herself to
finish ahead of one school.
Gilbert placed third in the high
jump with a jump of five feet,
seventh in the long jump and
eighth in the triple jump. She
also competed in the 55-meter
hurdles and the 200-meter dash.

Former Washington and Lee
lacrosse stand-out Ted Bauer
was inducted into the Lacrosse
Hall of Fame in ceremonies on
Feb. 8 at the Sheraton Towson

good job of shutting down Dooms,
and he looked for his shot and he hit
them tonight.’’

Dooms finished with 20
rebounds, but had just 12 points. Roy
Roberson led LC with 24 points.

Watkins led the Generals with
19 points, and Melton added 15, but
the Generals’ biggest contributions
may have come from two players
who combined for just six points.

Pless and Ehret combined to
anchor W&L’s inside effort in the
second half and combined for 11
defensive rebounds, most coming in
the deciding moments of the game.

engulfs Mary Washington 110-95

 

By SEAN O'ROURKE
Phi Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee men’s
swimming team is on a roll.

The team has won four meets in
a row with the latest coming Saturday
against a tough Mary Washington
squad. The visiting Generals came
from behind to post a 110-95 victory
and up their season mark to 6-4.

“‘We are very happy with how
we swam,’’ said coach Page
Remillard. ‘‘It was a tough meet and
we handled it extremely well.”’

After the first four events the
Generals trailed 38-35. But in the
fifth race, the 200-yard individual
medley, W&L took the top two spots
to take a 49-43 lead that they never
relinquished.

However, MWC was always in
striking distance and Remillard was
proud of his team’s character under
that kind of pressure.

“It was a pressure-filled meet.
The guys stayed keyed and looked
forward to their events because they
wanted to be the one to clinch the
meet for us,’’ said Remillard.

W&L had a swimmer place first

 

playing well. So is Bob. He gives us
an element we need — physical
play.’’

The two split time in the second
half after Miggins left with the
technical foul.

Despite the strong inside play
on the defensive boards, Canfield
wasn’t pleased with the inside game
on offense.

“‘We passed the ball inside
exactly six times tonight. That’s
pathetic,’’ he said. ‘‘All six times
resulted in scores — five on ball
reversals to outside shots, and one on
Pless’ basket. And when we go
inside, it helps the outside players.”’

Watkins agreed that the
Generals need to go inside more
often.

“*We need to get the ball inside,
because that opens things up on the
outside,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s so much
easier to shoot when the defender has
to go down and help out than when
he is running at you.”’

Watkins hit two of his three
second-half three-point attempts. They
came off passes from inside players.

W&L, not 6-15 on the year and
3-12 in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference, play Roanoke Saturday
night. The Generals are still trying to
lock up the eighth and final spot in
the ODAC Tournament.

**We haven’t given up yet, and
we’re still working hard,”’ said
Canfield. ‘‘Getting into the
tournament is still our goal, and it is
an attainable one.

The Washington and Lee
wrestling season sounds very much
like a broken record. ‘‘Senior Peer
Soderberg finished second...
second...second...’’

Well Soderberg finished
second again, but he wasn’t the only
one to do well.

Eight W&L wrestlers placed in
the Virginia College Division State
Championships, yet the team still
finished fifth. Longwood College,
winners of the W&L Invitational,
took the team championship.

Senior co-captain Peer
Soderberg led the team by finishing
second in the 177-pound division. In
his third consecutive appearance in a
final, Soderberg went up against Art
Whitaker, his foe in the W&L
Invitational finals. Again Whitaker
proved too experienced, and
Soderberg had to settle for second.
The victories at the meet helped

However, it was the consistent

Freshmen Adam Williams and
John Cochran both captured third
place finishes by winning their
consolation matches. Williams came
back from a broken nose, and
wrestled with a facemask, to defeat
Harold Babetto and up his record to
10-9 on the year. Cochran secured
his third place finish by pinning John
Gerlis late in the third period of their
consolation match.

The Generals had a quartet
finish fourth as John Cherry, Beau
King, Kevin Batteh, and John
Conkling rounded out the scoring for
the team.

The Generals head _ to
Longwood College for a dual meet
tonight, which should be good news
to Soderberg. He is 4-0 in dual
matches this season and he will try to
post his third consecutive victory over
Longwood’s Bryan Hartley.
Soderberg also has added incentive in
this match as his career record stands
at 49-34. He is looking to become the
first W&L wrestler since All-
American Rich Redfoot to win 50
matches in a career.

 

finishes by the rest of the Generals’
swimmers that solidified the victory.
Freshman Grant Holicky posted two
second-place finishes, classmate
Derek DeVries finished in the top
three twice. Chris Hagge, Larry
Brown, Roland Chase and Joe Tison
all posted third-place finishes.

“If our kids didn’t win,”’
Remillard said, ‘‘they finished in the
top three. And that’s what solidified
the win.

The Generals will wind up their
regular season Feb. 16 with a meet at
Radford. After that, it’s on to the
championship season.

However, Remillard isn’t
looking ahead yet. He says the team
is still preparing for the post-season.

Generals rally to top Lynchburg

 

By JAY PLOTKIN
Phi Sports Editor

 

When a team is 5-15, it really
doesn’t care how aesthetically
pleasing a winning performance is.
Just ask Washington and Lee head
basketball coach Verne Canfield.

“I was satisfied only with the
fact that we won,’’ he said after
W&L’s 71-65 win over Lynchburg
last night. ‘I was upset with our lack
of execution, but I was pleased that
we won.”’

After senior Mark Melton hit a
three-pointer to start the game,
Lynchburg scored seven straight
points and Canfield called an early
time-out.

‘‘We weren’t running the
offense and were missing long jump
shots,’ said junior Bryan Watkins.

Women's swimming extends streak

The Washington and Lee
women’s swimming team won their
14th consecutive Old Dominion
Athletic Conference meet Friday with
a win over Hollins College, 139-123.

“There is usually a pretty good
rivalry with Hollins,’’ said coach Kiki
Jacobs.*‘Everyone was pretty excited
(about the win) because it was a
conference meet.’’

Jacobs felt that the Generals
swam well in all of the individual
events. Three members of the team
each won three races.

Junior Claire Dudley dominated
the breaststroke events. She won first
place in both the 100-yard and 200-
yard races, and she also captured a
first place in the 200-yard freestyle.

Captain Jodi Herring also had
an impressive outing. She claimed
both the 500-yard and 1000-yard
freestyles. Herring finished first in the
200-yard butterfly.

Freshman Susan Fisher had an
impressive showing as well. She took
first place in the 100-yard and 200-

 

yard backstroke. She also claimed top
honors in the 200-yard individual
medley.

Saturday, W&L swam against a

“They were getting the long
rebounds and running. Coach told us
if we didn’t start running the offense,
they were going to blow us out of the
gym.””

The Generals responded by
taking an 18-17 lead on a Watkins
three-pointer, but the Homets
bounced back using their rebounding
strength. Daryle Dooms had 11 first-
half rebounds, including six offensive,
and the Hornets regained the lead 32-
30 with 1:27 left.

At halftime, the Generals trailed
36-32, and Canfield was not thrilled.
The Generals were out-rebounded 28-
12 by the Homets, who had 15
offensive rebounds alone. Canfield let
his team know about his displeasure.

“‘Coach gave us the business at
halftime,’’ said Watkins. ‘‘That really
woke us up for the second half.’’

It was a delayed wake-up,
though, because the Hornets opened
up a 46-38 lead after sophomore
Robert Miggins was hit with a
technical foul. It was then the
Generals woke up.

Melton hit a three-pointer, and
sophomore Bryant Pless hit a jump-
hook to cut the lead to 46-43. After
Dooms hit a free throw, Melton
scored again, freshman John Rogers
hit an eight-footer, and sophomore
Matt Newton found a wide-open Bob
Ehret for a lay-up to give the
Generals a 49-48 lead.

While the technical seemed to
spark the team, truth-be-told it was
the defense that got the Generals back

into the game.
“‘We came out and tumed up
the defensive pressure,’’ said

Canfield. ‘‘We trapped and played

aggressively, and that got us going.”’

The Generals forced 10 second-
half tumovers and held the Homets
without a field goal for over six
minutes in the second half. W&L

ar

went on an 11-2 run during that ,

stretch.

Lynchburg weathered W&L’s
first rally to regain the lead at 58-55,
but couldn’t withstand W&L’s final
push.

Senior Courtney Penn followed
a Paul Baker basket with one of his
own to tie the game at 59, and after a
Lynchburg time-out, Watkins gave
the Generals the lead for good with a
three-pointer.

‘*At the time-out, Coach said if
we had an open shot that we needed
to step up and take it,’ Watkins said.

Trustees up
tuition by
6.5 percent

By JASON KELLEY
Phi Editor

 

 

The Board of Trustees approved a tuition hike of six
and a half percent for next year, an increase that outpaces
inflation by more than two percent.

Undergraduate tuition for 1992-93 will be $12,330, up
from this year’s $11,575 fee. Law students will pay
$12,830 next year instead of this year’s $12,050.

The board, acting at its Feb. 15 meeting in
Washington, D.C., also approved room and board rate
increases. University housing will cost from $1500 to
$2300 next year and full board at the Evans Dining Hall
will run $2400.

For example, a single room in a suite in Gaines Hall
that costs $2130 this year will run $2200 next year.

University Treasurer Lawrence Broomall said his
office requested the increases based on projected expenses
and revenues for next year.

Broomall said increased staff compensation and other
outlays led to a projected expense increase, while certain
factors in the economy will slow down the growth of non-
tuition revenues.

The increase ‘‘is nothing we have to apologize for,”’
he said. ‘‘Our tuition level is still lower than that of similar
universities.”’

Broomall said faculty and administration salaties and
benefits are increasing.

“Fringe benefits have gone up substantially. Our
medical plan has faced 20 and 30 percent increases in
premiums in the last two years,’’ Broomall said.

He said the university must continue to increase
faculty salaries despite the weak economy to remain
competitive with other comparable schools.

According to John DeCourcey, W&L’s financial aid
director, the trustees also increased the total financial aid
available to students by about 14 percent. He noted that no
tuition money goes toward financial aid. Instead aid comes
from endowed scholarships and a special fund specifically
for financial aid.

DeCourcey said his office has seen an increase in
requests for aid recently, and with the tuition hike, they
expect even more.

‘You've got a lousy economy and people who
weren’t on financial aid before are coming in to see me
now about it,’’ DeCourcey said.

__He. said his office had requested that the board
approve close to $3 million for aid next year. The board
approved $2.7 million.

Looking ahead

 

By THOMAS EISENHAUER
Phi Senior Copy Editor

 

The Student Affairs Committee
reduced Delta Tau Delta’s punishment
for vandalizing its house to a one-
year suspension and three subsequent
years of critical probation Tuesday,
following university President John
Wilson’s recommendation.

Last month SAC suspended Delt
for five years after members of the
chapter broke windows, knocked
down walls, removed ceiling tiles,
disassemble lofts and destroyed a
brick bar before moving out of the
house on Dec. 22.

But President Wilson recommen-
ded that the penalty be reduced after
he investigated the situation in res-
ponse to Delt’s appeal.

“The penalty needed to be re-
thought,’” he said. ‘‘At the hearing
SAC held with chapter leaders and
the house corporation, SAC wasn’t
able to get to all of the circumstances
surrounding the last few weeks of fall
term [when the damage occurred].””

“T think the penalty ... should
punish the current chapter without
jeopardizing the prospect of a re-
newed and strengthened presence of
the fraternity at Washington and
Lee,’’ the president wrote in his rec-
ommendation to SAC.

President Wilson said SAC was
unable to completely understand
Delt’s situation during the original
hearing because SAC was investigat-
ing the nature of the destruction while
the chapter wanted to focus on its
plan for correcting the situation.

 

 

Sophomore Angie Carrington works against senior Whitney Hopkins in a
women’s lacrosse practice. Carrington and the Generals will open their season
March 7 on the Liberty Hall Field against Guilford.

He said he spoke extensively with
Delt President Robert Wilson, Vice
President Pat McCabe and House
Corporation President Taylor Cole,
°75, in order to determine the motiva-
tion for the damage.

*

 

 

SAC slices
Delt sentence

Panel follows Wilson’s advice

“There were elements I thought
were intentional and malicious [like
the destruction of the bar], and others
reflected a dissatisfaction with the
way their renovation plan had been
drawn up,”’ President Wilson said.

But the graffiti on the walls was
not malicious or vulgar, he said. The
broken furniture and other trash was
not cleaned up because the members
were moving out for renovation, the
president said, and they expected the
construction company would tear the
house apart anyway.

The new penalty, which takes
effect immediately, suspends the cha-
pter until July 1, 1993, but invites
Delt to apply for renovation by Aug.
15, 1992. If the application is ap-
proved, renovation would begin in
September on the Delt house and be
completed by Sept. 1, 1993.

SAC also asked Delt’s interna-
tional fraternity to turn over the chap-
ter’s charter to an ad hoc alumni
committee. The alumni committee
and the Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent would review the chapter’s cur-
rent members and remove those who
do not support the fraternity’s ideals
and the university’s ‘‘Standards for
Fraternities,’” according to a memo
detailing SAC’s decision.

Cole said that Delt would want to
participate in Renaissance.

“I’m very grateful that the presi-
dent decided to review the situation
and make a recommendation to the
Student Affairs Committee that I
believe helped with the penalty reduc-
tion,’’ Cole said. ‘‘I know the alumni
will be thankful that he interceded.”’

Robert Wilson said he thinks the
revised penalty is fair and Delt will
be able to rush successfully in 1993.

“More or less [the five-year
suspension] would have been a death
penalty,’’ he said.

Construction of an $800,000 art gallery on
Washington and Lee’s front campus will begin as
early as April.

Final approval of the project was granted by
the Board of Trustees at its meeting Feb. 15,
despite strong opposition to the location of the
gallery by students and faculty.

““Student concems were very strongly
considered,’’ said Brian Shaw, W&L director of
communications. ‘‘In the end, the board decided
that this was the best location for the building.”’

The gallery will house a collection of
Oriental ceramics, jades, and furnishings donated to
the university by Mrs. William Watson of Lynch-
burg. Watson, whose husband graduated from
W&L in 1929, is also donating $800,000 for con-
struction of the gallery.

Students circulated a petition in October to
oppose the location of the gallery, which will be lo-

Jim Olin (D-Va.) and Buddy Darden (D-

The second session is at 7:30 p.m.
Friday. Former Speaker of the House
Thomas ‘‘Tip’’ O’Neill and former Mas-
sachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis will

will have their own passes to get onto the
convention floor.

Donaldson said free passes for ses-
sions will be available to students and
their guests through the MC office in the
University Center. Passes will also be
handed out at the MC memorabilia sales
next week, also in the University Center.

Remaining passes will be available

cated between Tucker Hall and the Reeves Center.
Shaw said many faculty members also sent
letters to the Board of Trustees and the administra-
tion in opposition to the location of the gallery.
The board then delayed making a decision
on the gallery until they considered other locations.
Shaw said the board considered three
alternative sites, two in the gully across from the
Alumni House and one behind the Lenfest Center.
All three sights were rejected by the board.
Beverly M. DuBose, chairman of the bo-
ard’s capital planning committee, said the board
determined that the architecture and location of the
gallery were compatible with the front campus.
According to the architect’s model, the
gallery will be constructed of red brick with white
columns to conform to the surrounding buildings.
Shaw said the board voted unanimously to
approve the location and style of the gallery.
“They felt that the Watson Gallery needed
to be in close proximity to the Reeves Center for
them to complement each other,’’ Shaw said. ‘“The

other locations were just not close enough.”’

Construction of the gallery is being delayed
while architects decide whether the new gallery can
be connected to the Reeves Center by an under-
ground tunnel.

Shaw said the tunnel from the Reeves
Center will probably be the only entrance or exit so
that access to the gallery can be more easily con-
trolled.

Shaw said that when the Watson Gallery is
completed, he expects to see more students use the
Reeves Center.

Shaw said students will be able to research
the origins of Chinese porcelain and jade back to
the 10th century using the Watson collection.

‘*T think that the Reeves Center will become
a more viable part of the university with the addi-
tion of the Watson Gallery,’’ Shaw said. ‘‘It will
add tremendously to East Asian arts studies.’’

Shaw said Watson will bequeath money for
a professorship in East Asian studies to the univer-
sity at the time of her death.

Young said the passes are a good
idea so the gym is not overcrowded.

The university’s alcohol policy will
apply to all MC events, including the
Friday morning parade, Young said. ‘‘In
the past it’s been a problem.”

Young said ABC officers will be on
hand at the parade, as will Lexington
police officers.

Young said security members will
be watching for alcohol at float construc-
tion.

““We’re concerned about the safety
of people on the floats,’’ he said.

The Confidential Review Committee’s self-evalua-
tion is complete, but will not be released to the university
community until next week.

Dean of Students David L. Howison said he has
received the results of the CRC’s six-month long investi-
gation into possible procedural reforms. He will present
the report to the Student Affairs Committee Friday, after
which it will become a public document.

‘‘From the beginning, the report was supposed to be

a report to the SAC,’” CRC Chairman and Associate
Professor of Law Joan M. Shaughnessy said. “‘I have left
the decision of when it will be spread beyond that
committee to Dean Howison.”’

Howison said he wanted SAC to see the report
before it is released.

He said the report will be considered by SAC until
early April, when it will be presented along with SAC
recommendations to the faculty. He said the faculty will
vote on any changes to the CRC in May.

‘*We will have a enough time to look at the review
very carefully,’’ Howison said

Meanwhile, students are being asked to fill out a
survey about the CRC by members of a research class
taught by Professor of Sociology David R. Novack.

Novack said the survey is a class project, but the
results will be made available to anybody who is interest-
ed. He said the project should be finished in three to four
weeks.

Howison said SAC would welcome any input from
the survey, if it is completed on time, but SAC will
concentrate on the CRC report.

survey,’’ Howison said

That’s the home phone number of Lexington Mayor
Homer E. Derrick Jr.

We bring Homer’s phone number to your attention this
week because it’s the best way we can think of for
Washington and Lee students to voice their disapproval
of the car tax, the latest bills for which were recently
mailed out.

The way we see it, if the mayor is willing to put his
home number in the phone book, then he’s got to figure
that someone might call. So we suggest you take Homer
up on it.

If he answers, we'd like you to tell him that the car
tax is an unfair infringement on people who live here
nine months a year yet have no voice in city government.

If Homer doesn’t hang up after that, you might
mention that W&L students and their families constitute
a large percentage of the city’s income through such
means as shopping in town and paying the inevitable
parking tickets.

At this point in the conversation, Homer may become
somewhat hostile. But don’t worry; just keep talking. Tell
him that, although the university is exempt from local
property taxes, W&L gives the city large amounts of
money each year so that the city might recover some of
that lost income.

If that doesn’t work, try reminding Homer that the
university, as part of the Master Plan, donated over
$100,000 to the city so that it could build the Rockbridge
Consolidated High School. Or perhaps you should
mention that the city will net littlke money from what
amounts to little more than an attempt to harass students
who are not as well off as many city residents think.

Homer is by nature a very understanding man. We’re
sure he won’t mind taking time out from his day to hear
your concerns. So go ahead — give him a call.

 

Hooray for
progress

Guess what boys and girls! Starting next year, on
your way from the language lab to clapping for credit,
you can stop by and research some tenth century mugs
and saucers. And if those crazy W&L architects have
their way, you will even be able to take the secret tunnel
eastward toward the Reeves Center where you can
research some 18th century dinnerware. And that’s not
the best part of the deal the trustees have cooked up for
us. You know that dreadful grassy area by Tucker Hall?
Yeah, the one with the shade trees and squirrels. That'll
be bulldozed in April to make way for more bricks and
mortar.

All sarcasm aside, while we understand how dishes do
add to the prestige of any institution, we just can’t for
the life of us figure why they gotta be put in one of the
last green areas on the Hill. It’s probably too late to
change things, but if we had our way, those dishes would
be put in the Lenfest Center where people who like
delicate things hang out.

Oh, by the way, if the trustees are interested, we got
a great deal on 23,462 place settings of very small, late
20th century silverware at a Pan Am liquidation sale.
We’d be glad to donate them to the university if they can
promise they’ll build an adobe museum on that terrible
grassy patch between Washington Hall and Lee Chapel.

College cheats start
on a slippery slope

 

My VIEW

By Erma Bombeck

 

Michael Moore, a 24-year-old junior at
Rutgers State University, thinks he is breaking
new ground with his paperback, “‘Cheating
101: The Benefits and Fundamentals of Eam-
ing the Easy A.”’

His dream of elevating cheating to an art
form offers such i as wearing a
Walkman, using the stick-shift method (which
indicates multiple choice directions) and being
paged by a beeper during a test and getting
answers from friends on an outside phone.

You call that creative? I knew people in
college who cheated 30 years ago. They
wrote answers on breath mints and ate the
evidence, recorded answers on the ends of
their fingernails and then bit them off. A few
put notes on the soles of their shoes, and
several rummaged through wastebaskets in the
mimeograph room looking for master sheets.

But there is one glaring difference. The
“‘they’’ were scum who were dishonest and
brought shame and embarrassment to a uni-
versity. Without integrity, they missed what
education was all about. They were neither
admired, accepted or the stuff of which books
were written.

According to Moore: ‘‘It’s understood
between students that cheating is a reality.
You take it for granted that they have [cheat-
ed] in the past and will in the future.”’

I want to be disgusted with Michael Mo-

ore, but he has to wait his turn, First, I have
to show my real contempt for politicians who
lie and captains of industry who are con-
sumed with greed, for plumbers who over-
charge and lawyers dedicated to exploitation,
for law enforcement officers who take advan-
tage of people’s trust and writers who accept
Pulitzer Prizes for stories they invented.

They are the ones who paved the way for
Michael Moore’s book. Before any of us is
too complacent about putting the blame on
those mentioned above, look into your own
lives. What kind of message are you sending
to your children?

You can’t break into a car, but it’s OK to
fish without a license.

You can’t steal a bicycle, but it’s all right
to filch a few office supplies.

Don’t lie to your mother, but you can’tell
the person at the box office you’re big for 1!.

The. fall from integrity doesn’t happen
when you stub your toe over a large lie in
your path. It’s stumbling along a rough road
mined with one decision after another of what
is right and what is wrong.

The important thing to remember is that a
lot of books have been and will continue to
be written on ‘‘cheating.’”’ Most of the au-
thors, however, are serving time.

LET IT RIDE

 

By Chris Swann

Mock Convention: booze, ticker tape and Democrats.
Who would’ve pictured it at W&L (the booze, not the
Democrats, that is)? This is an event so famous (or infa-
mous) that the Virginia ABC board has bottles of Jim
Beam made with Mock Con labels.

Being like most of you, and deeply concerned with
politics, the Democratic party and Election Day, I have
volunteered my time and effort to lend whatever help I
could to Mock Convention. The Steering Committee,
however, found little use in a somewhat-humorous colum-
nist, so I gritted my teeth and joined a state delegation. As
a result, I have spent hours fretting about the political
makeup of Texas, a large and somewhat dubious area to the
Southwest.

Politics is a strange
animal, like a cat: you

‘Who all’s in have to stroke it just the
the parade? right way to get any reac-

; tion. This is especially
Well, we've got true of Democratic state
Dukakis, Tip chairmen or, more specifi-

cally, of their secretaries.
How many times can one
be put on that awful limbo
of the business world,
“‘hold?’’ It boggles the
imagination. I am a mem-
ber of the Texas political
committee, and as such I have spent innumerable hours
(three) on the phone to a state in which I have never set
foot so I can ask the executive director of the Texas
Democratic Party exactly what he thinks of Paul Tsongas.
Since that particular candidate has all the personality of a
dead mouse, I can guess his answer, but state delegations
need official comments.

Behind the calm facade of the Mock Convention
office room lies confusion, panic and punchy humor. The
Steering Committee deserves either a large amount of cash,
or alcohol (preferably both), for their efforts in managing
this mess. To fully appreciate what this is like, here are
some excerpts from genuine conversations:

‘Donkeys? Hell yeah, we got donkeys. They’re
coming in from Natural Bridge.”’

“OK, Dukakis comes in at 11:45. At 12:37 he has to
be in the press conference room, you'll say ‘Hello, wel-
come to Mock Convention,’ all that BS, then get him in the
car by 1:14...””

“Hello, my name is Chris Swann and I’m calling
from Washington and Lee University. I'd like to talk to Mr.
Slagle about the Democratic — yes, I'll hold.”

‘‘And he said L.L. Bean won’t support Maine ‘cause
they only contribute to certain people, so I said, ‘Really,
well I only shop at certain stores, screw you.””’

“‘He’s not there? Well, when-do you expect him in?
Well, can I leave a message? How about a phone number?
Excuse me, but do you speak any English whatsoever?’’

‘‘Who all’s in the parade? Well, we’ve got Dukakis,
Tip O'Neill, Mario Cuomo and Miss Teen Rockbridge.”

“‘Tsongas’ secretary is more boring than he is.”’

“Hello, this is Edward Blake from the National
Enquirer, we have a rumor that Bill Clinton was seen
dancing naked on stage at the 1988 Mock Convention,
could you confirm or deny that, please?’ — actual phone
call, I swear to God.

‘*Tucker’s not here. You want to talk to John Donald-
son? How about Jay? Well, who the hell am I supposed to
pass the ball to?’’

“The Lexington police? Oh, they love us. We’re
giving them a reason to exist.”’

“So what is Dukakis riding in, a convertible, a limo,
what? Oh hell, just put him in a tank.””

‘‘Hello, this is — yes, I'll hold.”’

O’Neill, Mario
Cuomo and Miss
Teen Rockbridge.’

Exercise your
right to vote

To the Editor:
I must disagree with Mr. MacKenzie’s

to the corrupt nature of our democratic system
and government. Although I am not enamored

not, I truly believe that voting is necessary and
simply one of the greatest rights in our Constitu-
tion.

When I was a lofty 18-year-old undergradu-
ate, I voted for issues: legislation against land-
fills, legislation against gambling, legislation for
the appropriation of lands as animal reserves and
occasionally I had the pleasure of voting for a
candidate who best represented views similar to
mine. Not all I wanted became law — most
notably, gambling was not legalized in my home
state — but believe it or not, many issues I did
want became law.

After putting myself through college, I
entered the work force and, subsequently, paid
more taxes, health and car insurance, and rent —
just to name a few of the more mundane aspects
of life after college. Then, as an inspired, idealis-
tic 23-year-old, I decided I wanted to travel, so I
sold my car and hit Europe, then moved to Japan
for a year. It was the only year I did not vote.
But, trite as it may sound, if you have ever
traveled extensively and studied a foreign coun-
try, you will realize just how powerful the Ameri-
can voting right is... but I do not presume to
know if Mr. MacKenzie has ever had the oppor-
tunity to broaden his visions outside the continen-
tal United States.

Lastly, as a practical 31-year-old, with a
child, mortgage, more health and car insurance
and a third-year law husband, I not only vote to
express my ideology, but also because of tax
legislation, school boards, sheriffs, health insur-
ance and senatorial wage increases.

Although the motivations for voting and the
reasons for casting your votes in particular ways
may change, there is always a good reason to
vote. If you abdicate your responsibility to vote,
you guarantee your voice on the issues will never
be heard in any meaningful way. Even one whose
views are as misguided as Mr. MacKenzie’s
sound should avail himself of the right to vote.

 

 
   

recent opinion regarding the evils of voting due

with the way the government operates, or does

 

LETTERS

Again, I haven’t ‘‘won’’ on all the issues,
but voting is one of the most painless and cheap-
est ways of getting my point across.

Simply, Mr. MacKenzie, when you no
longer get tax rebates, when you have to pay for
your own car and health insurance, when a
cogeneration plant puts a bid in your community,
when your child goes to public school, when
your park’s 100-year-lease expires, you may just
want to vote — that is, if you have an opinion or
care.

But I must admit, if Mr. MacKenzie aspires
to run for a political office, he would inspire me
NOT TO VOTE for him.

Registered-to-votely yours,
Martha Miller, Law Wife ’92

Leap babies have
reasons to party

To the Editor:

Finally, I must admit the truth. I am 5, and
I am Washington and Lee student. I can’t hide
any longer. It is time I came out of the closet and
faced reality — I am a leap baby. I’m birth-
dicapped. A leap-er. The world’s youngest Re-
publican. I need help, counseling. I need a birth-
day!

Well, it’s not quite that bad. The “‘Happy
Fifth Birthday”’ cards are already pouring in. It’s
always been fun having the rarest of birthdays.
However, it was quite frustrating trying to explain
to my elementary school classmates that I wasn’t
really only two years old, Equally so, arguing in
junior high school that I was allowed to have a
party on another day. Being a leap baby has
certainly had its advantages — I’ve gotten out of
a heck of a lot of birthday punches!

True, I technically can’t vote until 2044,
drink until 2056 or run for president until the
year 2112. And in 2232, retirement!

But, hey, it’s not a birth-defect. So, come
this Saturday, leap-ers of the world unite, it’s
your birthday!!

Sincerely,
Keith E. Grant, Leap Class °72, W&L °94

 
   

MDA Superdance
breaks its goal

To the Editor:

We along with Joe Slay, 72, would like to
give our thanks to all of those that helped contri-
bute to MDA Superdance this year. Not only did
Superdance reach its goal but surpassed it. The
total amount raised was $30,024! This money is
earmarked for research in the area of Spinal
Muscular Atrophy, Andrew Slay’s particular
disease. Speeding up the research, the money
raised will also help buy additional technology
and equipment needed in the gene decoding pro-
cess. Many people and organizations devoted
time and energy into helping make this event
possible and successful. Committee members,
pledges, faculty, administration, parents, citizens
of Lexington and especially our advisor, Font-
anne Bostic, gave unselfishly in both time and
money. We would like to congratulate Pi Kappa
Alpha and Chi Omega for raising $2,400 and
$1,500, respectively! Once again, thank you for
helping Superdance in the fight against Muscular
Dystrophy.

Laura Hendrey and Fred Renneker,
Co-Chairmen, MDA Superdance Committee

Candidate clarifies
SCC comments

To the Editor:

I wish to correct a statement in your Febru-
ary 6, 1992 issue of The Ring-tum Phi. | did not
say that the SCC ‘‘is not the right place for
sensitive matters.’’ I believe that the SCC is
completely capable of handling issues of verbal
harassment. I also believe that the SCC is not the
appropriate avenue for matters of a sexual nature.
Obviously, an elected group of students with the
power to ask someone to leave the university is
capable of handling a sensitive issue. I have
confidence in the class officers and in the SCC as
a whole.

Kirkland jazzes u

    

 

By Basui SINHA
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Kenny Kirkland, one of the
most acclaimed young pianists in jazz
today, will play at the Lenfest Center
at 8 p.m. Feb. 28.

As a musician equally at
home playing European classical, jazz,
Afro-Cuban, rock, fusion and rhythm
and blues, Kirkland promises to be an
exciting performance.

Kirkland said the program
will feature music from his latest al-
bum, Kenny Kirkland, which spent 13
weeks in the top ten on Billboard
magazine’s Traditional Jazz Album
chart and was hailed as a “Best of
1991” pick by USA Today and the
L.A. Daily News.

The L.A. Daily News also
praised a performance by Kirkland’s
quintet.

“In one of the most fiery and
involving acoustic jazz performances
seen in some time, pianist Kirkland
led asuperb group ... through a set of
futuristic music that was nothing but
arcane,” the newspaper article said.

Most of the album consists
of Kirkland’s original contemporary
jazz compositions, he said, although
he does interpret the works of great
jazz artists like Bud Powell, Wayne
Shorter, Ornette Coleman and
Thelonious Monk.

Kirkland is currently
interested in Afro-Cuban music and
Latin rhythms. He spent several years
working with the Afro-Cuban jazz
ensemble The Fort Apache Band.

“Jerry Gonzales from Fort
Apache and the percussionist Don
Allias, they are my teachers, they’ve
hooked me up with Afro-Cuban
music,” he said in an interview in The

   

|
MH

INNS

New York Times.

Kirkland said his mother is
Puerto Rican, and he grew up listening
to Afro-Cuban music so it is natural to
him.

“I feel I can be more
rhythmically exploratory with Latin
rhythms than I can be with mainstream
jazz,” he said.

Kirkland, who is from
Brooklyn, N.Y., said he began playing
piano atthe age of six, after convincing
his father to buy one.

“T lost interest after a few
lessons and wanted to quit, but my
i wasn’t going for that,” Kirkland
said.

Kirkland said he did not
develop his passion for jazz until he
began studying at the prestigious
Manhattan School of Music, where
he was influenced by Herbie
Hancock’s album Headhunters. He
said he then switched his major from
classical performance to theory and
composition.

Nonetheless, Kirkland said
he remains partial to the piano.

“T play electric keyboards
for certain effects, but the acoustic
piano is my first love,” he said.

After touring with the likes
of Branford and Wynton Marsalis and
Sting, Kirkland said, he is just
beginning his solo career. His “special
projects” for the future include playing
with Wynton Marsalis on the Jay Leno
Show in May, he said.

The concert is sponsored by
the Student Activities Board, and will
feature Kirkland andhis quintet, which
includes Charnett Moffett on bass,
Jeff “Tain” Watts on drums, Joe Ford
on saxophone and Milto Cardona on
percussion. Tickets are on sale for $5
in front of the Co-op this week.

Seniors lead W&L
scoring explosion

 

By JAY PLOTKIN
Phi Sports Editor

 

Seniors Jeff Roberts scored four
goals and had four assists to lead the
Washington and Lee men’s lacrosse
team to a season-opening 25-8 win
over Greensboro Wednesday.

“It’s a good start to the season,”
said head coach Jim Stagnitta.

Senior Drew Anton scored four
first-half goals as the Generals
jumped out to an 114 lead.
Greensboro had tied the score at 2-2,
but Anton sparked a W&L run that
pushed the lead out to 9-2.

The run included five goals in the
first 3:18 of the second quarter.
Junior Wiemi Douoguih, Roberts,
Anton, sophomore Colin Higgins and
junior John Hunter did the scoring.

W&L then got three goals each
from Roberts and Higgins as part of

a 9-0 third quarter run to nail the
door shut on the Hornets.

“Our seniors stepped up like
we've waited for them to do,”’ said
Stagnitta. ‘“Drew [Anton] and Jeff
[Roberts] had an opportunity to take
charge, and they took control early.””

Eleven different Generals scored
goals, Juniors John Hunter, Douoguih
and David Lefkowitz each scored
twice, as did freshmen Andy Dutton
and Matt Willis. Junior David
Schiminger had a goal and dished out
three assists. Freshmen Michael
Alessi and Ty Tydings also scored.

‘We played a lot of people, and
they responded,’’ Stagnitta said.
‘*Schiminger has come into his own
and has gotten a lot accomplished.
The freshmen — [Andy] Dutton,
[Shawn] McKenzie, [Ty] Tydings and
[Michael] Alessi — did a nice job.
They'll be a big part of what we'll do

this year.”’

Defensivley, the Generals held
Greensboro to just four goals in the
first three quarters. Senior Coleman
Devlin and junior David Hunter
anchored the defense, which held
Greensboro to just 14 second-half
shots. W&L got off 56 shots on the
day, 29 in the second half.

‘I believe the kids will hit their
peaks at the end of the season at the
championship meets.”’

Washington and Lee men’s
swimming coach Page Remillard
made that comment in the beginning
of January. It is now the
championship season for the
Generals, and by the looks of things,
Remillard’s prediction was right on
the money.

But before the Generals could
worry about their championship meet,
they had to finish up their dual meet
season. The Generals ended their
season with a convincing 133-49 win
over Radford. It was the team’s fifth
victory in a row and upped their
record to 7-4, a major improvement

 

over last year’s 1-5 finish.

The Generals won eight of the
ten events against Radford despite
most swimmers not swimming in
their regular events. Still, Remillard
said, the team looked good.

‘We're definitely happy with
the Radford times,”’ he said. ‘“They
swam off events to help fine tune for
the invitational, but they showed that
they are ready to swim their season-
best times.”’

Senior captain Doug Brown and
freshman John Rowe each won twice.
Brown took the 200-yard and 500-
yard freestyles. Rowe won the 400-
yard individual medley and the 100-
yard backstroke.

Junior Andrew Pearson swam
off with 50-yard freestyle, and

freshman Derek DeVries rounded out
the first-place finishers by winning

100-yard butterfly.

The 7-4 record is the best since
the 1989-90 season, but that is not the
goal the team set for themselves at
the beginning of the season. The team
wanted to show that they belonged
with the major Division III schools
like Wabash and DePauw, Remillard
said.

They get their chance today at
DePauw University in Indiana, where
the Generals begin swimming in the
three-day Liberal Arts Invitational.

“This team is anxious to show
what they can do with the big guys of
Division III swimming,’’ said Coach
Remillard. ‘There is really no outside
pressure on them, just their drive to
do well, and I believe they are going
to do well.”’

Dudley reaches NCAAs

 

By ERIN MCKINNEY
Phi Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
women’s swim team walked away
from the Atlantic States
Championships and the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference Championships
with two second place finishes last
weekend, thanks largely in part to a
different scoring system.

In the ODAC portion of the
meet at Radford, a new scoring
method gave higher scores to lower
finishers. This helped Hollins College
end W&L’s streak of four ODAC
Championships, 660 to 609 although
WA&L actually won more races.

In the Atlantic States portion of

did everything she could to avoid that
result, though. She qualified for the

return to action Saturday against NCAA Championship meet by
traditional state rival Virginia in Winning the 200-yard breaststroke

ranked sixth in Division I.

Dudley also took first place in
the 200-yard individual medley and

the 100-yard breaststroke. Her three
wins earned her Swimmer of the
Meet honors for the Atlantic States
meet.

Senior Jodi Herring shined in
the ODAC meet. She captured first
place in both the 100-yard and in the
200-yard butterfly. She also finished
second in the 500-yard freestyle race.
Herring’s performance won _ her
Swimmer of the Meet honors for the
ODAC meet.

Coach Kiki Jacobs was
impressed with the Generals relay
teams, who won all four races.

“They won all of the relay
races in the ODAC meet and 3 out of
the 5 in the Atlantic States,’’ she said.

Every W&L swimmer claimed
a season-best time last weekend.

Jacobs stressed that the Generals
lost once again strictly because they
only have nine swimmers.

“*We lost because of numbers,
not because of our swimming,’’ she
said.

The Washington and Lee
basketball team saw its season end
one game shy of the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference tournament.

A loss at Eastern Mennonite
over Washington Holiday dashed
W&L’s tourney hopes, but the
Generals still finished with a hope
for a strong 1992-92.

After beating Mary
Washington Feb. 17 78-62 behind
19 points from senior captain Mark
Melton and 15 from junior Bryan
Watkins, the Generals fell behind
early at EMC before having to foul

 

 

Generals’ season ends with loss

to catch up.

The Royals thwarted W&L’s
effort by making 30 of 39 free
throws for the game. Vaughn
Troyer hit all 13 of his foul shots
and scored 30 points to lead EMC
to an 80-74 win.

Sophomore Paul Baker scored
a career-high 24 points to lead the
Generals, and sophomore Robert
Miggins added 12 points and 11
rebounds. W&L went to the foul
line just six times on the night.

The loss eliminated W&L
from the ODAC tournament picture,
but W&L still needed a win against
Randolph-Macon to close out the
season on a high note.

The Yellow Jackets, though,
got 20 points from Jeff Taylor and
scored 29 of their 66 points from
the foul line in stopping W&L 66-
53.

Miggins scored two quick
baskets to cut R-MC’s halftime lead
to just 34-31 to start the second
half, but W&L could get no closer
despite a career-best 22 points from
freshman John Rogers.

WA&L ends the season with a
7-18 record, 3-15 in the ODAC.
Next year, the Generals return five
of their top six scorers from this
year’s team, including Watkins
(14.4) and Baker (10.2). a

Panhel
gets
in SAC

By LEIGH ALLEN
Phi Staff Reporter

 

 

The Washington and Lee faculty
gave the Panhellenic Council a vote
on the Student Affairs Committee
Monday night but prevented students
from getting majority control of the
committee by adding another faculty
member.

Previously, the PHC president
was a non-voting member of SAC. A
sixth faculty member will be added to
the committee in order to maintain a
balance between student and faculty
votes,

“‘Our goal was to get Panhel on
SAC, with or without another faculty
member,’’ said Dean of Students
David Howison.

Howison said SAC had recom-
mended that the PHC president get a
vote without adding an another facul-
ty member, a proposal that would
have given students a 6-5 majority on
the committee.

The faculty amended SAC’s
proposal to include the additional
faculty member.

History Professor Holt Merchant
said he proposed the amendment in
order to keep SAC balanced.

Merchant said that although the
relationship between the administra-
tion and students has improved over
the last several years, the faculty
should not relinquish control of SAC.

““SAC was not a fun place a
few years ago,’’ Merchant said. ‘‘I
can’t say that some issue won’t come
up ... to divide faculty and students.’’

Howison said he would have
preferred a student majority on SAC
because the committee reports to the
faculty on student life.

Howison said the committee
thought a student majority would
create a positive image for SAC.

The faculty has the final author-
ity to determine SAC’s membership,
Howison said, regardless of its own
recommendations.

“It was ultimately the faculty’s
decision, and we will support them.
We're happy with the way it worked
out,’’ Howison said.

The new faculty member will be
elected at the faculty meeting in April
and will have a seat on SAC by
spring term, according to Professor of
Politics Lewis John.

John said that the faculty has
not decided _—_ who will be the new
SAC member.

 

Two students hurt in Domino’

From Staff Reports

 

Two Washington and Lee stu-
dents, a Lexington firefighter and
three restaurant employees were treat-
ed at Stonewall Jackson Hospital last
night after chloramine gas was re-
leased into the Domino’s Pizza on
South Jefferson Street.

Sophomores Maura McMahon
and Wendy Neel suffered from respi-
ratory irritation after inhaling the gas
and were released after emergency
room treatment, a hospital spokesman
said. The two women live in an apart-
ment above Domino’s.

Firefighter Trent Roberts said
Domino’s employees created the
chloramine gas about 8:20 p.m. Thur-
sday when they mixed ammonia and
chlorine bleach for cleaning. The

Viruses infect computers;
experts say W&L is clean

 

From University Computing

Computer virus detection and
disinfection programs have not yet
found here any of the viruses sweep-
ing the nation, including the ‘Michel-
angelo’ virus experts expect to do its
damage on March 6, the birthday of
the namesake artist.

Michelangelo is a ‘‘boot-sector’’
virus, meaning it infects the part of a
disk where start-up instructions are
stored. It enters a computer when the
computer starts up with an infected
disk in the drive, and it can infect a
computer’s hard drive, replicating
from there onto other disks, Michel-
angelo affects IBMs and compatibles.

Though University Computing
staff have not found any viral infec-
tions in the W&L computer system,
they recommend users take precau-
tions against viruses.

The best precaution is to backup

all programs and data.

Users can also run anti-viral
programs, available for university PCs
from University Computing, and from
retail stores.

A precaution against programs
like Michelangelo is to use the
*‘date’’ command to circumvent the
virus’ trigger date. For example, to
avoid a March 6 activation, change
the date on March 5 to March 7, and
on March 7 correct the date.

Network computers receive their
date from the network, and Ruley
said the threat of infection is not
serious enough to warrant changing
the network date.

Other viruses currently
threatening U.S. MS-DOS users are
the ‘‘Friday the 13th’’ virus set to
activate March 13, and the Maltese
Amoeba virus, or Irish Virus, intro-
duced to the United States from Ire-
land and set to activate March 15.

result in serious lung damage.
Firefighters dumped the ammo-
nia-bleach mixture onto Jefferson
Street and diluted it with water. They
also evacuated the Domino’s building
until the gases escaped.
Jefferson Street was temporarily

The Emergency Medical Service
treated one Domino’s employee at the
scene and took three other employees
to the hospital.

Most of the firefighters left the

“building, but retumed about 11:15

p.m. when a firefighter inspecting the
restaurant became sick and also had
to be treated at Stonewall Jackson
Hospital. Fire Chief Kenneth Hall
said his crew called the Virginia De-
partment of Emergency Services to
help remove the remaining chemicals.

Hall said th. upstairs apartment
was apparently free from chloramine
gas last night. But, Hall said, all the
Domino’s food supplies in the build-
ing might have to be destroyed.

“‘We may not let them salvage
anything,’” Hall said. ‘‘They may
have to take a total loss.”’

CRC proposes

rules and result |Decency’ to

under a policy |attitudes

proposed by the
Confidential Review Committee.

The proposed plan, made public
this week after a six-month self-eval-
uation by the CRC, also says W&L
isn’t bound by the First Amendment
and may legally suppress student
speech.

‘*While our discussion is appro-
priately informed by the Constitution-
al and legal requirements placed on
government regulation of speech, we
are not bound by such constraints,”’
the 46-page document states.

The report includes a broad
statement of conduct standards that
the CRC says should be the basis for
complaints. It also includes sharp
criticism of its own recommendations
by two CRC members.

The CRC report recommends
the panel continue to hear cases in-
volving sexual misconduct and sexu-
al, racial, ethnic and religious harass-
ment and discrimination, It allows for
any case to be tried by the Student
Conduct Committee instead of the
CRC if the accuser and the accused
agree.

The self-evaluation also propos-
es that student representatives be
given a 4-3 majority over faculty on
the CRC, and that the students be
appointed by the Executive Commit-
tee. The current makeup is four facul-
ty members and three students, with
the students appointed by the univer-
sity president.

The basis for all complaints
would be a ‘‘Principle of Civility and

Decency,’ described in the report as

‘*a general policy, not a detailed code
of conduct.’’

The Principle does not outline
exactly what would be considered a
violation, but instead states that its
basic tenet is mutual respect.

“Students, faculty, administra-
tors, guests and townspeople will not
be subjected to disrespectful or im-
proper conduct on the part of mem-
bers of the Washington and Lee com-
munity,’’ according to the introduc-
tion to the Principle.

The Principle does give sugges-
tions as to what could be considered
a violation. Examples include using a
position such as dorm counsellor to
force someone to have sex, having
sex with someone while he is drunk,
making fun of someone for being
“‘awkward or unattractive ’’ and dis-
rupting the speech of a person whose
political views differ from one’s own.

The Principle states that prose-
cuting students for such acts would
not be a violation of their First Ame-
ndment right to freedom of speech
because W&L is a private school
rather than a state university.

The report proposes that both
the accused and the accuser have
student advocates who may question
witnesses during hearings. No such
advocates are currently used. Five of
the seven CRC votes will still be
needed to convict or sentence a stu-
dent.

Two of the appendices to the
report offer dissenting opinions by
CRC members Allan Ides, professor
of law, and third-year law student and
EC Rep. Jeffery Kelsey.

Ides’ statement criticizes the
report as ‘‘a proposal that is marked
by a stunning lack of definition.’’ He
states that while the Principle seems
to apply to all students equally, it is
intended only for the protection of
minorities.

“It insults women and minori-
ties by telling the they are not capable
of survival in a neutral system; they
don’t have what it takes,’ Ides
writes.

Ides also says the policy is con-
trary to W&L’s educational objective.

““‘We are educating young peo-
ple who live both private and public
lives in a democratic society, a cen-
tral tenet of which is freedom of
speech. The message of any campaign
to curtail offensive speech, no matter
how well intentioned, is antithetical to

On Delt, SAC made
Its Own decision

 

By THOMAS EISENHAUER
Phi Senior Copy Editor

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee’s reduction of Delta Tau Delta’s
penalty for its December house-trash-
ing was not the same reduction rec-
ommended by university President
John Wilson.

In response to Delt’s appeal of
its five-year suspension, Wilson rec-
ommended on Feb, 24 that the penal-
ty be reduced to a one-year suspen-
sion, ending Jan. 1, 1993, plus four
years of ‘‘critical probation,”’

The next day SAC considered
Wilson’s recommendation and voted
7-3 to reduce its Jan. 20 penalty to a
suspension ending July 1, 1993, and
three years of critical probation. SAC
also stipulated that the Interfraternity
Council president would participate in
the Delt alumni committee’s review
of current chapter members.

SAC member Peebles Harrison
said Wilson ‘‘clarified some of the

facts for us.”’

Excutive Committee President
Giles Perkins agreed, ‘‘President
Wilson only made a recommendation.
The decision was ours.”’

Wilson found that the vandalism
was less extensive and over a shorter
time period than the 10 weeks SAC
originally believed, Dean of Students
David Howison said.

Perkins said, ‘‘The president’s
version had fewer individuals invol-
ved and less damage. If we'd had that
information before, I think we wou-
Id’ve come to about the same thing.’’

Howison said Delt’s presenta-
tion at the hearing was not ‘‘purpose-
fully vague,’’ but didn’t present a
detailed picture of the destruction.

Perkins agreed, ‘‘My opinion is
they were extremely intimidated by
the hearing process. I still don’t know
what exactly happened. The damage
was there, and they didn’t give me
personally a pattern of what happened
so I had to go on what I saw.’

 

On Republican side, Bush battles populists

 

By AMANDA STEWART
Special to The Ring-tum Phi

 

With U.S. President George Bush basing his
re-election campaign on the status-quo, the can-
didacies of conservative commentator Patrick
Buchanan, and to a lesser extent, David Duke,
have been touted as attempts to return the Repub-
lican Party platform to the control of the party’s

conservatives. A more
thorough review of the
Republican  presiden-
tial candidates reveals
the true populist nature
of the Buchanan and
Duke campaigns.

Buchanan is a great supporter of isolationist
and nativist policies. Buchanan seeks the repeal
of affirmative action legislation, a stance which
sits well with both conservatives and blue-collar
workers. With his call for ‘‘fair trade,
also reaches out to the industrial magnates and
workers. This self-proclaimed trade hawk wants
nationalistic economic policies aimed at keeping
U.S. aid from foreign countries as well as a more

hard-line stance with trading partners who fail to
provide open markets for U.S. goods. Buchanan
also advocates strong anti-immigration legislation,
beefing up border security to protect American
workers from unfair labor competition, and
protecting American society from unwanted

David Duke takes all of these populist
positions one step further. The power of Duke’s
message lies in his past and present persona. The
former Klansman and author has based his cam-
paign on anti-affirmative action policies and the
need for anti-immigration legislation. Duke also
represents himself as an “‘outsider’’ of national
politics and has gained anti-establishment votes.

It is not surprising that this populist rhetoric
is doing well in a nation afflicted with recession,
especially when the incumbent Republican pres-
ident is running on the continuation of present
policies, Bush, a moderate, seems to be regaining
much of the conservative support he lost in the
early days of Buchanan’s campaign. Not only are
conservatives acting pragmatically, but there
seems to be a growing disenchantment with this
new populism among free market Republicans.

 

Despite the contrasts between Bush and his
challengers, all three agree on some basic poli-
cies. All of the Republican candidates maintain
that it is Congress which has hamstrung ‘‘free-
market’’ economic reforms. They also continue to
call for a strong defense, though all realize the
efficacy in cutting the defense budget. On social
issues the Republican candidates have reaffirmed
the 1988 platform of choice in public education,
school prayer, and a desire to stop abortion.

Amanda Stewart is the president of the
W&L chapter of College Republicans.

Wa&L is PC too

You are now entering Washington and Lee. Please leave
your Constitutional rights at the border. You may pick them up
when you leave.

Following a resounding endorsement of free speech in the
Confidential Review Committee’s self-review, published just
this week, the committee proceeds to explain why free speech
may be forbidden at W&L. The committee has the audacity to
claim that the principle of freedom is what gives the university
the right to suppress speech:

““[W]e are free as a private university to meet our
educational mission in ways not open to state schools, and...
historically we have exercised that freedom.”’

Their proposal, misleadingly titled the ‘‘Principle of Civility
and Decency,”’ is nothing more than a second, multi-sanction
Honor System under administration control. Moreover, the
Principle flies in the face of free speech and the concept of the
university as a marketplace of ideas.

To borrow one of the CRC’s own examples, students may
under the Principle be expelled for ‘‘prolonged: public ridicule
of an individual because one finds him to be awkward or unat-
tractive.’’ So those of you with ugly roommates, pretend you
don’t notice, and for God’s sake don’t tell anyone.

The CRC admits their policy is ‘‘broad’’ and ‘‘sweeping.”’
Any speech or action that could be construed as disrespectful,
by any W&L student to anyone, townsperson, professor or
another student, warrants a CRC hearing and puts the student
in danger of expulsion. That’s all there is to it.

The Principle purports to encompass all members of the
W&L community, but the CRC may only handle student offen-
ders. Though the revised CRC would consist of four Executive
Committee-appointed students and three non-students, appeals
would go to the dean of students, the senior faculty member on
the Student Affairs Committee, and the Executive Committee
president. At no time does the accused have the right to an
open hearing, not even in cases unrelated to sexual misconduct.

The CRC’s rationale for this re-structuring is an affront to
student dignity. The committee claims on one page of its study
to exist ‘‘for the benefit of women and minority students,’’
while claiming on another page that it ‘‘operates on behalf of
all members of the university community.’’ We agree with Law
Professor Alan Ides, who wrote a criticism of the CRC self-
review.

The Principle ‘‘insults women and minorities by telling them
they are not capable of survival in a neutral system; they don’t
have what it takes,’’ Ides says. ‘‘It tells men, particularly white
men, that they are incapable of seeing beyond their sex and
race. The more often this message is emphasized the more
often it will be acted upon.”

We join Professor Ides in calling on the Student. Affairs
Committee to outrightly reject this proposal.

Moreover, we renew our call to the Executive Committee
for a clarification of the White Book wherein dishonorable
conduct might be an honor violation. It is not unreasonable to
expect that W&L students act civilly and decently. But
questions of such conduct should be handled by a student com-
mittee with an open appeals process. The structure for this is
already set up in the EC, and would eliminate the necessity for
any CRC at all.

One final note of reproach to the Student Conduct
Committee for its reference, in a letter to CRC Chairman Joan
Shaughnessy, to the CRC self-evaluation as ‘‘an unenviable
task.’ To the contrary, self-evaluation is a task every
superfluous governmental organization craves.

Thank you for visiting Washington and Lee. You may pick
up your Constitutional rights at the border. Women, minorities,
and especially ugly people, be careful out there.

More on the lighter side

of MC ’92: the parade

 

LET IT RIDE

By Chris Swann

 

I have concluded that it is the wrong
time of the month to speak to any political
secretary in Texas. Never in my life have I
attempted to speak with a more stressed-out
group of individuals, except perhaps a group
of female friends one week before Fancy
Dress. (By the way guys, FD is Mar. 27-28,
in case you've forgotten. Not addressed to
you, ladies, who have probably had the date
fixed on your calendars for the past month.)

Now that I’ve given up on the politi-
cians and analysts in Texas, I’ve taken to
calling Delta Airlines. See, the Texas float
planned to have ‘‘two members of the Dallas
Cowboys’ football organization’ on it for the
parade Friday. That was how I worded the
letter I faxed to some Delta rep in Wash-
ington, asking for what legalese-speaking
businessmen call ‘‘gratis transportation’’ and
I call ‘‘free tickets in exchange for free adver-
tising.’’ The two ‘‘members’’ told us they

_ would show up for an appearance fee and free

tickets. The two members were also Dallas
Cowboys cheerleaders.

Hey, come on, I couldn’t write Delta
and ask them to fly up the next best girls to
Sports Illustrated swimsuit models. According
to rumor in various business circles, certain
Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders shake more than
their pom-poms. But that’s just a rumor.

Anyway, I got a very pleasantl y-worded
refusal, probably because Delta is the only
airline left in America that’s worth a damn
and doesn’t need advertising. We tried to get
Lloyd ‘‘You’re no Jack Kennedy’’ Bentsen.
Failing that, we got all sorts of suggestions:
Tom Landry, Nolan Ryan, Lyndon Johnson’s

 

cousin... The way things are going now, we
might just exhume Sam Houston who’s buried
up the road on Route 11 and put him on the
damn float.

Texans being Texans, the delegation
plans to have the biggest and best float. If
most people I’ve talked to don’t get around to
starting theirs (they’re due today), we may
have the only one. I sometimes feel like
Boone in Animal House: ‘‘Some guys get to
ride down Main Street on a roll of toilet
paper? Big f----- deal.” But it’s impressive
that we busy college students took the time
and effort to actually rent trucks, get flatbeds
and build a float in our spare time between
ordering kegs and organizing the various
parties for Friday night. Hey, don’t give me
any of that, ‘‘Parties! Is that all you think
about?’’ I mean, would you plan to spend five
hours on the Mock Convention floor Friday
evening with your delegation if you couldn’t
dance and drink like rock stars afterwards?

This is getting to be like the real world:
perpetual ‘‘hold’’ buttons (I’m never using a
telephone again), hassling with Jim Bob out
in BV to rent a flatbed, signing waivers
allowing the company to sue if any paint is
scratched off the rented truck and organizing
a parade including some impressive political
personalities, local law-enforcement officials
and 1,600 inebriated college students. Maybe
I can get some career mileage out of this:
‘‘political analyst’’ would look great on my
much-adjusted resume. Nah, ‘‘humor column-
ist’’ still sounds better: someday a group of
Republicans will dust off old copies of The
Ring-tum Phi, read my articles, and laugh at
my stunningly-accurate portrayals of Demo-
cratic presidential candidates and in-depth
perception of the American college psyche.

Oh well, we’ll do anything for a party.

By Christopher F. Tricarick, ’95

 

I will not discuss the objections which I and, unless |
am greatly mistaken, most of my fellow students and a
considerable part of the faculty have to the proposed site of
the Watson Gallery. These objections have been adequately
explained by previous writers on these pages; their wide
prevalence has been demonstrated by the many people who
signed Mr. Chapman’s petition in October. Yet there are
some very serious implications in this choice of sites.

One of Washington and Lee’s principle assets is our
sense of community: those who teach and learn and work

=

here are united by similar concerns and ideals. We, the .

resident community, will be most affected by the gallery,
but the decision concern-
ing it has been made,
contrary to our almost
unanimous wishes, by the
Board of Trustees — a
remote power with con-

from ours. This is a depar-
ture from the very nature
of community as we at

understood it.

It would, perhaps, be
ungrateful to accuse the Board of Trustees of having
disregarded our feelings; after all, it postponed its decision
for four months on account of Mr. Chapman’s petition. But
there is no evidence that it ever considered the essence of
our objections to the gallery. Three alternative locations
were successively dismissed, according to University
Communications Director Brian Shaw, because they were
not sufficiently near the Reeves Center. We do not want the
gallery near the Reeves Center; we do not want it on the
front campus! The question whether any real need exists for
a close physical proximity between the Watson gallery and
the Reeves Center — a question to which, I believe, most
of us would answer no — was never discussed.

 

~

cems entirely dissimilar ,

Washington and Lee have *

~

Concerning the gallery itself, 1 am intensely enthusias-

tic. A philistine objection to art and culture can be imputed

to very few of us, who oppose the construction of this ¢

gallery on its present site. It is a mockery to the very nature
of art that it be used to destroy a spot of natural beauty,
and, profoundly, to alter the beauty for the Colonnade —
itself an architectural work of art.

No member of the Washington and Lee community
ever forms an opinion, or makes a decision, on a matter of
vital importance to the university without first considering
the position Lee would probably have taken on that matter.
Since the appearance of our campus is largely the result of
Lee’s work repairing it after the destructions of war, we
have ample evidence of his aesthetic feelings. Lee would
not have trees planted in rows, because ‘‘nature never
plants things in rows.’’ Lee did not like the appearance of
a fence, which he said was ‘‘a blot on any lawn.’’ Can we
doubt how he would have felt about the appearance of
many buildings crowded one upon the other?

A crowded appearance is not unaesthetic in itself. No
one will complain because the buildings of the Acropolis or
of the Forum are crowded together. But though Athens and
Rome are to our eyes hallowed symbols of beauty and
civilization, they were, in their day, commercial, cosmopoli-
tan centers. The great building projects for which Pericles
and Augustus are so renowned had as much to do with
personal pride and ambition as those of Donald Trump.
This spirit has no place at Washington and Lee; it is the
farthest thing from Lee’s ideals. Our campus’s appearance
bears the indelible mark of Lee’s love of simplicity and
natural beauty, and has exerted an inestimable influence
upon our character as a community. Thus, bu‘lding the

gallery beside the Colonnade will affect a radical departure :

from the standards which through generations has remained
the nature of this institution.

Decades of history
at the old theater

To the Editor:

I read with interest a recent article in The
Ring-tum Phi dealing with the University Theater.
But I do believe that Lee Kahn was not the first
to lead an organized theater group. When I
arrived here in 1960, the director was a fine
actor, director, stagehand, set- and light-designer
Dr. Cecil Jones. I, and many others, had the
privilege of working with him in the original
theater on Henry Street. In fact, there are several
of us still here in the community. Before, Dr.
Jones, I believe Carlsson Thomas (who is back in
town as a builder) worked with the theater group.

All of us who had the pleasure of working
with Dr. Jones remember such fine plays as
Enemy of the People, The Lady's Not for Burn-
ing, Boy Meets Girl, and Tartuffe. These are only
a few of the plays produced in those early years
when such a splendid theater as the Lenfest
Center for the Performing Arts was only a dream.
All of us would, I am sure, like to see the former
theater directors remembered.

Please see that this corrected. Thank you very
much. After all, ‘“The play’s the thing!”’

Yours truly,
Yvonne S. Emerson

Student demands
computer upkeep

To those in charge of university computers:

The proper maintenance of our computer
hardware is crucial for students who wish to
spend their time efficiently and productively. The
computer lab in the library works against this
reasonable goal. Often, one or two of the three
computers which operate through the laser printer
are broken. Paper is out, and, at times, printers
are as well. Quattro-Pro is only available on one
of the three computers, and, unfortunately for me
and other students wanting a professional looking
spreadsheet, the computer it is available on has
been broken for some time. Even when all three
computers are working, they are still slower in

spell check and other computer operations. Long
lines form toward the end of each term exacerbat-
ing these unacceptable problems and making
students feel rushed once they get onto a working
computer. Enough said, please fix the problems.

Sincerely,

Eight Minks prove
ROTC is still alive

To the Editor:

Despite the fact that ROTC has been closed
at Washington and Lee, the program is far from
defunct. There are presently 13 active cadets on
campus. This past summer, eight of the 13 at-
tended, and successfully completed, Camp Ad-
venture. The training site was Fort Lewis, Wash-
ington ... yes, on the other side of the country. If
you ask any of the cadets, they will tell you that
it was truly a unique experience. Camp Adven-
ture was the only national advanced camp in the
history of the United States. That is to say, every
third-year cadet in the U.S. went to Fort Lewis
last summer.

Camp Adventure was the training pinnacle for
those eight cadets. Now the same eight are faced
with new challenges and more demanding respon-
sibilities. Upon return to W&L, each of the senior
cadets received a mission. As a class, the mission
is to aid in the preparation of the five other
cadets for their time at the advanced camp.
However, this year there is an extra task ... to
work as an integral part of the Marshall New
Market Battalion of VMI. Once again, the eight
have been successful. The fall field training
exercise which the Minks took part in with VMI
went well and Col. Joyner’s staff commended the
Minks on the part they played.

You may be asking just who these eight
minks are. The truth be told, you see them every
day on campus, as they quietly go about being
students just as the majority of W&L does.
However, there is one significant difference ... the
eight minks go into service for the U.S. Army
very soon, In the middle part of January, each of
the eight received their duty status and branch

Bill Benson will go on active duty after
graduation as an armor officer. Kevin Carl was
branched field artillery and also received active
duty. Joe Milcoff received a regular army com-
mission for active duty in ordinance, but will
serve two to four years as an officer in air de-
fense artillery first. Toby McCoy was granted an
education delay in order to pursue studies in law
school. Toby will be commissioned as a field
artillery officer, but will serve in the judge advo-
cate general corps after completing his legal
studies. Doug Lefevre received a reserve duty
commission in ordinance. He will pursue a career
in the private sector while serving in the reserves.
Cecil Garrett also received a reserve duty com-
mission and will pursue a career in the private
sector while serving in a field artillery national
guard unit. Trevor Hildebrand was commissioned
regular army in ordinance, but will serve two to
four years as an infantry officer. Greg Evans
received a reserve duty commission in armor.
Greg is planning to serve in the national guard
while continuing his education in law school.

Congratulations to the eight Minks. Best of
luck in your assignments. God bless.

SPE pledges not too sexy for MTV

 

By ERIN MCKINNEY
Phi Staff Reporter

 

If you weren’t in
the dining hall Friday
morming when Mi-
chael Neal, a Sigma
Phi Epsilon pledge,
jumped up = and
screamed his good
news, you might not
be aware that the SPE
Lip Sync group is
headed for Daytona
Beach, Fla., to compete on MTV.

The five SPE members, Neal, Robert Stewart,
Drew Hammond, Phillip Harries and Kris Fegen-
bush, won second place in the W&L SAMS Rock
Alike Contest last month with their rendition of
“I’m too sexy,’’ by Right Said Fred.

The group of freshmen, also known as Stick-
man and the Catwalks, and the first place winners

Lip sync group
Stickman and the
Catwalks head to
Daytona Beach
to perform ‘I’m
too sexy’ on MTV

of the contest, Cheez Whiz, both sent their video-
taped performances to New York City to compete
in the national contest.

Stickman and the Catwalks was chosen as one
of eight national finalists, earning the opportunity
to go to Daytona Beach to compete against other
acts from across the nation while being taped by
MTV.

Why did the second-place group win over the
first place act, which performed Barry Mannilow’s
“‘Copacabana?’’ The SPE group said that Jerry
Darrell, W&L’s SAMS advisor, told them that
MTV was looking for current and popular songs.

“It was kind of ironic that the song went
number one the week after we did it,’’ said Fegen-
bush.

The group said they put a lot of hours into
the act and ‘‘fought, screamed, argued — then
worked everything out.’’

But after a while, they said, winning ceased
to matter to them.

‘We just wanted to have fun,’’ Neal said. ‘‘I

think that came across in the end.”’

‘‘Actually,’’ Hammond said, ‘‘We were
inspired by Margaret Thatcher.’’

Thatcher, the former British prime minister,
spoke at the Virginia Military Institute on Jan. 24,
the night of W&L’s Rock Alike Contest.

The national competition will take place on
Sunday, March 15 at 10 a.m. It will be taped and
aired three times the following weekend.

“It will be judged like a ‘Star Search’ kind of
thing,’’ Neal said.

The eight finalists will compete in two groups
of four. Finally, the winner from each group will
compete on MT V’s ‘‘Lip Service,’’ where they will
lip sync to random songs.

The group said they are excited and, of
course, nervous.

“But being nervous is, in a way, the best
part,’’ Stewart said.

In 1990, a group of W&L Phi Gamma Deltas
won the national contest and came home with a
new Ford Thunderbird.

Rare infection kills at Radford

W&L Health Center doctor warns students to take precautions

 

By BRIAN ROOT
Phi Staff Reporter

 

A rare bacterial infection. that
killed a Radford University freshman.
last week appears. in. almost
unrecognizable patterns, but does
seem to arise more often among stu-
dents, said a Washington and Lee
Student Health Center doctor.

Thomas Hamlett, 17, was admit-
ted to the Radford Community Hospi-
tal Feb. 24, complaining of severe
headaches and an upset stomach. At
the hospital, he was diagnosed as
having septicimial meningitis. Altho-
ugh he was given treatment for the
infection, Hamlett died Feb. 26.

The infection attacks the mem-
brane that surrounds the brain and the
spinal cord, and is fatal in about 10
percent of all cases.

‘*(Septicimial meningitis] is a
very difficult diagnosis,’’ Dr. Jane
Horton, W&L university physician.
‘It’s very important to discover the
bacteria early on, or the infection can
be fatal.””

Patsy Crouch, Sigma Alpha

Epsilon _ "To keep
everything with the fraternity
and the university on an even
keel — trying to satisfy all
concerned.”’

 

According to Horton, the bacte-
ria is very contagious.

“It can be passed by almost any
sort of contact,’’ she said. “!That’s
why. outbreaks most often ,, occur
among students or military recruits.”’

If the bacteria’s presence is
detected early, treatment with antibi-
otics will very likely prevent life-
threatening
illness, Horton
said.

‘“Howev-
er, the student
at Radford was
diagnosed fairly |.
quickly and
given the prop-
er treatment, Horton
and he died anyway, That just shows
that this is a very dangerous infec-
tion,’’ Horton said.

Horton said the infection is
caused by the bacteria meningococ-
cus, which can only be discovered by
a spinal tap. She said it is not current-
ly known how the bacteria enters a
person, but she speculated that some

people may be more susceptible to its
effects that others.
“It’s possible that some people
contract the bacteria, but have only a
very, mild reaction, and then: pass. it
on to:someone else,”’ she said: “‘That
would explain why it seems to appear
at random.”’

Horton said Lexington and sev-
eral other cities in this area experi-
enced an outbreak of meningitis
among elementary and middle school
students in 1986.

She said the early symptoms of
the infection resemble those of the
flu: fever, aches and pains, a head-
ache and stiff neck. The infection
may also cause a patient’s blood
pressure to drop drastically, causing
chronic drowsiness or even a coma.
Patients may also develop a skin rash
that is characteristic of the infection.

“It is very important that any-
one who develops these symptoms
seek immediate attention through the
W&L Health Center or through the
emergency room at Stonewall Jackson
Hospital,’’ Horton said.

Board
appoints
editors

By NICOLE KEELER
Phi Staff Reporter

 

 

The Publications Board appoint-
ed the editors and business managers
for next year’s campus publications at
its Monday meeting.

Those appointed and their posi-
tions are as follows:

The Ring-tum Phi: juniors Tho-
mas Eisenhauer and Cathy Lopiccolo
will serve as editors; junior Whitney
Swift will be Business Manager.

Calyx: sophomore Anthony
Catalano will serve as editor and
sophomore Miriam Neel will be busi-
ness manager.

Ariel: sophomore Brian Carpen-
ter will serve as editor.

Political Review: sophomores
Cottie Miles Ryan Dennard will serve
as editors.

Journal of Science: senior Jenn-
ifer Zambone will serve as editor.

Pub Board President Rick Peltz
said it was unusual for Calyx to have
just one editor, but ‘‘in light of the
dismissal of one of the Calyx editors
earlier this year,’’ the Publications
Board felt one editor might be a
better choice.

Nineteen people applied for the
positions. Peltz said positions were
given based on the candidates’ ‘‘inter-
view, professional skill, experience,
management skill and, to some extent,
other activities.”’

Most of the new editors have
goals in mind for the upcoming year.

Political Review Editor Miles
said he wants to ‘‘relate [Politics
Professor Delos] Hughes’ Politics 265
class to contemporary issues and to
focus on political thought.”

Miles’ co-editor, Dennard, said
he would like to ‘‘take a more active
approach to getting pieces, maybe
soliciting articles.””

Ariel Editor Carpenter said his
goal is ‘‘to make Ariel the highest
quality, most diverse expression of
talent that exists on our campus.”’

The job hunt stinks

 

By LAKEISHA TOWNES
Phi Staff Reporter

 

With graduation approaching
rapidly, Washington and Lee seniors
are feeling the heat of the recession
that is affecting people across the
country. Jobs are always hard to find,
but the recession is further hindering
seniors’ chances of breaking into the
job market.

“It’s really tough — the tough-
est it’s been in a long time,’’ senior
Tim Gallagher said. Although an
interviewer may state that he would
like to hire him, Gallagher said, the
interviewer often also says that the
company is hiring fewer people than
usual. This can get discouraging,
Gallagher said, but if you put forth
enough effort, you can find ‘‘some
success.”’

Gallagher is not alone in his
difficulties. Beth Talkington said she

hates the job hunt and ‘‘considers it a
chore.’’ She added, however, that she
is unsure of her specific job field,
which makes the hunt more difficult.

So how do seniors go about
finding a job? In addition to the regu-
lar application-and-interview method,
many seniors use W&L alumni, con-
tacts their parents may have and just
talking to people to get any job infor-
mation available.

On the more positive side, some
good can come out of the job hunt
process. The interview process pro-
vides a chance to express and sell
yourself and to leam more about the
company. And a new job gives you
the chance to meet new people and
work in a new environment.

These benefits, however, are
possible only if a job is found. Good
luck to all the job-hunting seniors. It
sounds like plenty of luck, plus an
economic recovery, may be needed.

Meditate on a logically impossible question, and
then paint. That’s the general process behind Zen painting,
according to a Zen artist whose work is on display in the
duPont Gallery.

Artist and calligrapher Stephen Addiss, who gave
the Mar. 2 Glasgow Endowment Lecture, headlines an
exhibit that also displays traditional Zen art from the Shoka
Collection until March 20.

Addiss said his art is inspired by two art forms.

“My work comes from two sources --- the nude,
which has been the basis of much visual art of the westem
world, and calligraphy, the foundation of Far Eastern brush-
work,” he said.

In a lecture to a 20th century music class at
Washington and Lee, Addiss said Zen painting is a direct and
exciting art form.

Addiss’ art has appeared in over a dozen exhibitions
across the United States, Europe, Japan and China.

However, Addiss’ talents extend beyond the visual
arts. His first love was music.

The Ring-tum Phi, March 5, 1992

’

Zen meditation causes
some amazing results

*

Addiss studied composition in college, he said,
but his greatest influence was meeting the famous composer
John Cage.

After graduation, Addiss was living in New York
City when he heard about Cage, who was teaching at The
New School For Social Research. Addiss decided to take a
class with Cage. i

The concepts Cage was teaching were so different
from anything he had learned previously, Addiss said, that
he either had to drop the class or open up his mind. He
managed to do the latter, he said, and it changed his life.

“Cage teaches how to get beyond the limits of »
your own self,” Addiss said. “We all have limitations of
what we can imagine and do.”

Addiss also has performed folk music throughout
Southeast Asia for a year and a half on a government
sponsored cultural exchange.

“The most fun thing [of the trip] for me was to
meet musicians and share things,” said Addiss. ;

Addiss received his bachelor’s degree in
musicology from Harvard University and his master’s and
doctorate in both musicology and art history from the ‘
University of Michigan. He has taught Japanese art history
at the University of Kansas in Lawrence since 1977. '

Suicide isn’t the only option

 

By JOYCE BAUTISTA
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Although February was National Suicide
Prevention Month, the Washington and Lee counsel-
ing center decided not to highlight the suicide symp-
toms or steps in preventing it.

“There are certainly no more suicides at
Washington and Lee than at other comparable uni-
versities,” University Psychologist Dr. James Worth
Said.

Two or three W&L students have attempted
suicide this year, which is about average for similar
schools, according to Worth.

“Although [itis] academically chal-
lenging, W&L has a caring, responsive fac-
ulty and administration,” he said.

W&L’s schedule of vacations also
sets the university apart from other
comparable colleges, making students less
susceptible to suicidal tendencies.

“Since [February] break was added
there has been only one suicide,” Worth said.
“Winter term always sees the most suicide
attempts.”

During Worth’s 20 years at W&L,
the counseling center has never sponsored a
program connected to a specific month
concerning suicide, he said.

Instead, Worth said, the counseling
center tries to tackle problems like eating
disorders and alcoholism that may eventually
lead to suicide attempts.

“Very often suicide attempts will
occur when the student is drunk,” he said.

Worth said it is a mistake to get
“wrapped up with the numbers” concerning
suicide. ‘“One is too many,” he said. “No
suicide attempt is acceptable.”

Students must realize that there is a
qualitative difference between attempting to
kill oneself and seeking counselling for
suicidal tendencies, he said.

Worth said he and Associate Dean
of Students Anne Schroer-Lamont,
university psychologist, treat all counselling
sessions as confidential.

“T have literally counseled thousands of
students,” Worth said, “and only two or three were
serious enough to get others involved against the
student’s will.”

By Virginia state law and professional ethics,
Worth said, he is required to take some action to
prevent a student with overt suicidal tendencies from
hurting himself --- even to the extent of informing the
authorities.

“If someone comes to me depressed and
just wants to talk,” Worth said, “he or she shouldn’t
be afraid that I’m going to freak-out and call their
parents.”

Worth said he hopes that people who need
to talk will consider the counselling center.

“We’re not just going to tum them in,” he
said.

A student who is apprehensive about
speaking to one of the counselors should seek help
from the university’s peer counselors, dorm
counselors, residence assistants or his family and
friends, Worth said.

“We [peer counselors] deal with the more
superficial side of suicide,” said Robert Wilson, a
dorm counselor and peer counselor. “Dealing directly
with suicide is not a large part of our training. If the
case is serious we refer them to someone who has had
training.”

 

Wilson said student counselors do not try to
solve other students’ problems, but “to help [them]
find the ability within themselves to improve their
situation.”

There are certain keys to detecting a potential
suicide, Worth said. These include depression,
previous suicide attempts, suicides of family or friends
and threats of suicide.

“Not all threats result in suicide, but suicide
attempts were all preceded by threats,” Worth said.
“Take a threat seriously.”

Worth said he understands that many people
have thought of suicide. But he said there is a
difference between “suicidal ideation,” a fleeting
thought about what suicide would be like, and

Washington and Lee se-
nior Peer Soderberg and fresh-
man Adam Williams wrapped
up the 1991-92 wrestling season
at the NCAA Qualifier held at
Wabash College last weekend.

Soderberg, a 177-pounder,
won his first round match 8-7
over Ballo Marchan before
getting pinned by defending
NCAA champion Peter Wang.

Soderberg won two more
matches in the  consolatoin
bracket before falling to Mike
O’Conner. Soderberg finished
his career with a 52-36 record
and set a personal mark with his
15-9 record this year.

Williams lost both of his
matches at the qualifier to finish
his season with a 9-11 mark.

Earlier start doesn’t bother men’s tennis

 

By SEAN O’ ROURKE
Phi Staff Reporter

February is not the most ideal
month to play tennis outdoors. Most
of the time it’s cold, windy and
miserable.

However, to complete the
Division III schedule before June, the
Washington & Lee men’s tennis team
had to open their season in February.

They began on Friday with a
convincing 8-1 win over Christopher
Newport College. The Generals only
loss was an upset of No. 1 singles
player Richard Yates. But Yates
didn’t have to worry about the team
on this day.

Robbie MacNaughton, Tom
Mazziotti, Talmedge Trammell, Wes
Ruggles and David Schweppe swept
‘the other five singles matches from
‘second through sixth, respectively.

 

Then Yates turned around to
team-up with Macnaughton to cruise
to an easy win at No. 1 doubles. The
teams of Mazziotti/Schweppe and
Ruggles/Trammell rounded out
W&L’s scoring.

“Tt was a pretty good weekend,”’
said assistant coach Gavin Colliton,
filling in for head coach Gary Franke.
“The guys played well.”’

The Generals continued their
opening weekend with two Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference matches
on Saturday.

The Generals faced Roanoke at
9:30 a.m. It was 43 degrees with a
windchill of 18, and the wind was
gusting up to 45 mph. Not ideal ten-
nis weather.

It didn’t have any effect on the
Generals. They rudely dismissed the
Maroons 9-0. Yates rebounded from
his loss and dominated his match

from start to finish. The other five
singles and three doubles teams kept
their records spotless with easy wins.

The Generals then had to brave
the elements again Saturday afternoon
as they took on Guilford. The Gener-
als stayed warm despite the elements,
winning 7-2.

All six singles won and the dou-
bles team of Yates/MacNaughton
polished off their opponents to com-
plete W&L’s scoring.

Colliton said the team isn’t match
tough yet and that caused some lapses
in concentration during Friday and
Saturday’s matches.

Franke echoed those thoughts
when he talked about the keys to a
successful season,

“They haven't played a lot of
matches,’’ he said. ‘‘They need the
matches to gain experience and the
intensity needed to win. We have a

The Generals were expecting a
great indicator of where they are to
be last Tuesday’s scheduled match
against Kenyon. However, many of
the Kenyon players fell ill and the
match was officially canceled. The
two teams played four singles and
two doubles and came up even, 3-3.
It will not count as a team match, but
the scores will count for the players’
personal records.

As it stands now, the Generals
are 3-0, 2-0 in the ODAC. The Gen-
erals travel to Hampden-Sydney today
for another ODAC match, and they
return home for James Madison on
Wednesday.

Washington and Lee head base-
ball coach Jeff Stickley knew going
into the 1992 season that he would
have to get contributions from his
freshman class if the Generals were
going to have any kind of a season.

While he had hoped for the con-
tributions, he didn’t know that they’d
come so soon in the season. Fresh-
men played key roles in two wins as
the Generals split their first four
games of the season.

On Friday against West Virginia
Tech, freshman Duane Van Arsdale
was the offensive hero. With two outs
in the first inning, Van Arsdale deliv-
ered a bases-loaded double in his first
college at bat, giving the Generals a
3-0 lead they would never relinquish.

Senior T. J. Daly pitched into the
seventh inning allowing just three
runs, and senior Toby McCoy pitched
the ninth to record the save in a 9-8
season-opening win. Freshman catch-
er Todd Stanton had three hits and
drove in two run, and junior Jon

W&L women’s
swimmers take
5th at DePauw

By ERIN MCKINNEY
Phi Staff Reporter

 

 

The Washington and Lee

women’s swimming team ended their |}

season last weekend with a respect-
able fifth-place finish at the Liberal
Arts Invitational at DePauw Universi-
ty.

“The girls finished in the mid-
dle of the pack,’’ said head coach
Kiki Jacobs.

Jacobs felt that the intensity that
the girls had during the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference Champion-
ships was missing from this meet.

“It was tough to swim (at Lib-
eral Arts) coming off of ODACs,”’
said Jacobs.

Jacobs said that it was a tough
meet because a number of girls who
will compete at the NCAA meet
swam at DePauw.

Junior Claire Dudley, who will
represent W&L at Nationals, ran up
against some of next week’s competi-
tion. In the 100-yard breaststroke,

Hesse also drove in two runs,

“‘T.J. pitched about as good a
first game as he has thrown in four
years,’’ said Stickley. ‘‘He went
longer than we expected him to.”’

On Saturday, the Generals split a
double header with the Bears, losing
the opener 12-9 before claiming the
second game 9-6. Again, Van Arsdale
was the offensive star.

In the first inning of the first
game, he hit a two-run homer and
then hit another two-run blast in the
fourth inning. Daly also drove in two
runs in the first-game loss.

The Generals earned a split when
Van Arsdale hit another first inning
home run, this a three-run shot, and
freshman Bates Brown pitched five
innings and allowed just two earned
runs while striking out five. Daly
provided the game-winning hit with a
two-run double in the second inning.

“‘Van Arsdale had a pretty good
weekend,’’ said Stickley. ‘‘He’s a
good player and we expect him to
contribute.”

Van Arsdale’s three home runs
are more than the team leader had on

BASEBALL, GOLF, LACROSSE, TENNIS, TRACK

Freshmen respond to early season challenges

last year’s team, and his 10 RBI are
just five away from last year’s
leader’s total.

“‘Any time we get three home
runs, it surprises me,’’ said Stickley.
“It'll be tough for him to keep up
that type of hitting, but we sure hope
he does.’’

Van Arsdale led W&L’s offensive
attack, going six for 10. Senior lead-
off hitter Brian Harper was six for 12
and scored six runs. He had two hits
in each game. Daly went four for 10

and drove in four runs as the desig- | 5

nated hitter.

On Wednesday, the Generals’ ==

bats were cooled a bit by Division I
Holy Cross. Craig Johnson held the
Generals to just three hits on the
afternoon as the Crusaders rolled to a
15-0 win on Smith Field. Van Ars-
dale, sophomore Chad Loizeaux and
junior Keith Camp had the W&L hits.

““They’re one of the best teams

 

we'll play all year,’’ said Stickley. a"

“‘We also play Mary Washington on
Sunday. Those are our two toughest
games. It’s good experience for our
guys to play them.”’

 

 

The Washington and Lee
men’s lacrosse team began the de-
fense of its 1991 Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference title with a 19-9 win
at Randolph-Macon.

Senior Drew Anton scored three
of the game’s first four goals and five
of W&L’s first six, and the Generals
jumped out to a 7-3 halftime lead.

“I moved back to midfield this
year,’’ said Anton, who has scored 12
goals in three games, of his scoring
spree. “‘I’m able to use my size to get
in position to get off good shots, and
I’m getting a little lucky right now.”’

Phi Staff Reporter

Their months of hard work and discipline came
down to one three-day meet in Indiana.

The Washington & Lee men’s swimming team
faced some of the best in Division IIJ swimming last
weekend and proved they belonged.

The Generals gained some well-deserved respect
by placing third at the Liberal Arts Invitational, behind
Wabash and DePauw.

‘‘Happy is an understatement,’’ said coach Page
Remillard. ‘“When it was all over, the other teams were
in shock at how well we did.’’

The Generals came within 20 points of finishing
ahead of DePauw. But, DePauw competed in the diving
competition and had their score augmented by those
points,

“I don’t consider it a third-place finish,’’ said
senior captain Doug Brown. ‘‘Swimming and diving
are two separate events and they should be scored that
way. So really, we beat DePauw by two points.”’

The Generals started strong, winning the first
morning session on Friday, However, they lost their
edge at the night session and were shutout.

‘‘We came out flying,”’ said Remillard. ‘“The guys
saw Doug[Brown] trim 15 seconds off his season-best
time and they knew it was going to be a good week-
end. However, they got lost in that feeling a bit that

 

Rowe, Brown qualify for NCAA meet

night.”’

Nevertheless, the Generals regained their compo-
sure and swam well the last two days. Remillard
attributes the rebound to the experience the team gained
on Friday.

‘*The guys saw that the other teams weren’t going
away. Saturday and Sunday they knew they’d have to
concentrate the whole time and not get wrapped up in
the good feelings of winning.’’

Remillard also said the third-place finish justified
their invitation to the meet.

‘*When DePauw invited us they were hoping we'd
just be competitive and do better than were at the time.
When we left, their coach gave us the ultimate compli-
ment. He said, ‘You don’t have our respect, you have
everyone’s respect.’ That was a tremendous feeling,’’

Two swimmers that also gained everyone’s respect
were Doug Brown and freshman stand-out John Rowe.
Both Brown and Rowe qualified for Nationals with
season-best times in five events.

Brown will compete next weekend in the 500-yard
and the 1,650-yard freestyle. Rowe will vie for top
honors in the 200-yard and 400-yard individual medley
and the 200-yard breaststroke. Their efforts earned
them Co-Swimmers of the Meet honors.

‘‘Our goal is swim better times than we did this
past weekend,” said Brown, ‘‘We want to go much
faster and be competitive in all our events.”’

 

 

W&L 59-19 and held the Generals
shotless in the third quarter.

“Coleman showed everyone
that he is capable of playing at a
higher level,’’ Anton said, ‘‘That
gives us more confidence.”’

The Generals, 2-1 and ranked
seventh in Division III, travel to
Franklin & Marshall for a game Sat-
urday. The Diplomats are ranked
13th.

‘*A lot of people will be looking
at Saturday’s game to judge how
good both teams are,’’ Anton said.
“‘We need to send people a message
that we are as good as last year’s
team, or maybe a little bit better than
last year’s team.”’

Hudnall cleared of rape and sodomy charges

 

By CATHY LOPICCOLO
Phi News Editor

Chad Edward Hudnall, a former Virginia
Military Institute cadet, was acquitted Wed-
nesday of raping and sodomizing a W&L
freshman in her dormitory room Oct. 13.

After the trial, one juror said the jury
didn’t have enough evidence to prove Hudnall
was guilty beyond reasonable doubt, as the
law requires.

‘*We had to go on the evidence,’’ the
juror said. ‘‘We could not just look at her [the
freshman] weeping and convict him.”’

On hearing the not-guilty verdict, Hud-
nall was visibly relieved, slumping over the
table where he sat with his lawyers. His
mother, seated behind him, burst into tears.

On the other side of the room, the
woman who charged Hudnall with sodomy
and rape began sobbing and ran from the
courtroom, with her mother and friends fol-
lowing to console her.

According to a Rockbridge Regional Jail
spokesman, Hudnall was released Wednesday
night on bond. One of Hudnall’s attorneys,
William Bobbitt Jr., of Waynesboro, said

 

Hudnall’s original $25,000 bond was reduced
after he was acquitted.

The 5-man, 7-woman jury deliberated
over two and a half hours before reaching the
not-guilty verdicts. After two hours, the jury
had reported it was unable to reach a unani-
mous verdict after three ballots. A juror said
after the trial that 10 jurors favored acquittal
while two favored conviction.

Rockbridge County Circuit Court Judge
George E. Honts III ordered the jury to con-
tinue deliberations and take another vote. The
verdict came 30 minutes later.

Commonwealth’s Attorney Eric Sisler
presented almost three hours of testimony,
but no physical evidence or medical reports.
He would not comment after the trial on why
no medical reports were entered as evidence.

The 19-year-old complainant testified
first, repeating her claim that Hudnall un-
dressed her while she slept in her Gilliam
Dormitory room, and that he put his penis
into her mouth. She said Hudnall then with-
drew and proceeded to rape her vaginally.

‘‘There was a man at the end of my bed
with no clothes on, lifting my body [to take
off my underwear],’’ the woman said. ‘‘He

climbed on top of me and started kissing my
breasts.”’

The woman, who cried during much of
her testimony, said Hudnall jumped off her
bed when she told him to stop and asked his
name. She testified that she put on a shirt and
ran to a friend’s room.

Several of the woman’s hallmates and

‘The Principle’

The revised CRC, according to
the proposal, would have jurisdiction
over all breaches of ‘‘The Principle of
Civility and Decency.”’ According to
the commentary section of the report,
the Principle is in the W&L tradition
of ‘‘measuring actions against [a]
general standard, not a code of specif-
ic rules,”’

The report says that the EC and
the Student Conduct Committee are
within this tradition. However, the

Aggarwal considers open SCC trials

 

By JOYCE BAUTISTA
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Newly-elected Student Conduct Com-
mittee Chairman Reggie Aggarwal is consid-
ering opening the doors on SCC trials.

Aggarwal said he hopes to educate
students about the SCC’s function.

‘*T don’t want the students to view the
committee as some surreptitious, elite
group,’’ Aggarwal said. ‘‘I want to get stu-
dents familiar with the process while guard-
ing confidentiality.’’

An SCC trial would be opened only
upon the request of the defendant, he said.

His proposal comes in the first year the
SCC has conducted business under its new
constitution. The Student Affairs Committee
revised the SCC constitution last year, in-
creasing SCC autonomy and allowing it to
release the results of — but not the names of
those involved in — the cases it hears.

‘“‘The newly autonomous SCC reflects

the trend of student government,’’ he said.
‘*It shows that the university has faith in its
students.”’

If the SCC decides to recommend to
the Students Affairs Committee that defen-
dants be given the option of an open trial,
the recommendation would then have to get
faculty approval.

Dean of Students David Howison,
chairman of SAC, said, ‘‘At this point we
[SAC] have to wait for what the SCC has to
say.”’

Howison said he likes the idea of
educating students about the committee, but
refused to comment on the possibility of
open trials before receiving an SCC recom-
mendation.

Aggarwal said there are ramifications to
having open SCC trials.

‘*Many defendants who choose to have
open trials may play the public,” he said.

Current SCC Chairman Chris Haley
agreed.

policy within the tradition of the Hon-
or System as a general standard.

Ides, however, calls the Princi-
ple ‘‘a cloak designed to cover the
proposal with an appearance of tradi-
tion and legitimacy.’’ He points to the
procedural section of the proposal
which states that violations ‘‘relating
to sexual misconduct, or harassment
or discrimination based on the basis
of race, ethnicity religion, or sex’’ are
to be reported to the CRC. Ides cites
this statement as proof that the CRC
will not operate in a context beyond
these violations.

‘*This strikes me as a peculiarly
circumlocutious manner to get at the
problem,” he says.*‘if the ERC is
going to police sexual assault and
specified categories of harassment,
let’s just say so,”’

Constitutional questions

The Principle states that since
WA&L is a private school, ‘‘while our
discussion is appropriately informed
by the constitutional and legal requir-
ements placed on government regula-
tion of speech,
we are not
bound by such
j constraints.’’

The proposal’s
commentary
elaborates on
this point,
stating that
many facets of
W&L might be
considered
unconstitution-
al.

“‘Cardinal elements of this insti-
tution, such as the honor code, the
fraternity system and the workings of
the Student Conduct Committee, have
historically operated in ways which

“I’m against it for a number of rea-
sons,”’ Haley said. He cited the possibility of
trials becoming a media circus and of stu-
dents becoming afraid to bring up cases.

“The cases we hear are sometimes
sensitive,”’ he said. ‘“There is no reason to
bring up people’s mistakes into the spotlight.

“{ don’t think any of this in the near
future will be brought up... [to] SAC,’’ Haley
said. “I’ve talked to a few people on the
committee, and they’re not in favor of it.’’

After Tuesday’s SCC meeting, Haley
said he concluded that the members of SCC
are against open trials.

“Everyone was pretty adamant about
keeping them [the trials] closed,’’ he said.

However, the idea of a mock trial was
brought up at the meeting as another possible
tool to educate the student body about the
SCC, Haley said.

“The only reason Reggie [Aggarwal]
wanted to look into the possibility of open

 

SCC trials was to educate,”’ he said.

Che Ring-tum Phi

Founded September 18, 1897

Clinton in ’92?

So, we had a first ballot surprise. Only two other times
since 1908 has Mock Convention nominated a presidential
candidate on the first ballot: William Jennings Bryan in
1908 and Ronald Reagan in 1980, one known as ‘‘The
Great Orator’’ and the other ‘‘The Great Communicator.”
Both faced very little opposition as the convention met.
Does Bill Clinton deserve such undisputed recognition?

Questions of military service, questions of sexual
impropriety, questions of financial mismanagement. Any one
of these have been known to kill political careers. Clinton
is plagued by all three. Many say Clinton is a damaged
candidate who will be slowly crucified during the general
election this fall. If this is true, the Democrats cannot afford
to nominate a candidate with such an uncertain background.

If a more pressing issue had not come up last week, we
would have run an editorial last week endorsing Paul
Tsongas for Mock Convention’s nomination. Pro-business,
with a clear, long-range economic plan, Tsongas does not
follow ideological lines. This could make him popular
among moderate, dissatisfied Republicans in November.
Tsongas, quickly developing a charisma of his own, also has
his impeccable reputation going for him. As Tip O’Neill
said this weekend, ‘‘Paul ... portrays decency and honesty to
the American people.”’

Yet Tsongas is another Greek Democrat from Massachu-
setts. His campaign is very unorganized (as his campaign
chairman explains, they never really expected to get this
far) and terribly underfinanced. Clinton has a strong political
machine, well-financed and boosted by the schedule of the
primaries. Despite his background, Clinton is clearly the
frontrunner, especially after the Super Tuesday returns. He
might very well take the nomination on momentum alone.
In this way, Clinton was an understandable choice for MC.

But don’t give him the nomination yet. Clinton controls
only about 780 pledged delegates of the 2,145 needed to
win. Tsongas, while holding only about 400 pledged
delegates, can easily catch up with strong showings in the
upcoming contests in Illinois, Michigan and Connecticut. The
contest is far from over. Super Tuesday did exactly what it
was supposed to: it gave a giant boost to a native son.
Clinton has yet to win a primary not in the South. He may
prove to be just as regional as Tsongas. Despite pleas from
Mario Cuomo for an early decision, followed by a
concentrated attack on the president, this race is likely to
remain in question until the real convention this summer.

snorkel, Homer

In the spirit of Mock Democratic Convention, the
university is taking a new approach to solving the car tax
problem. They’re throwing money at it.

In a memo recently circulated among Lexington City
Council members, City Manager T. Jon Ellestad thoughtfully
thanked university Treasurer Larry Broomall for W&L’s
allotment of $50,000 to the city for, what else? A snorkel
fire truck, of course.

We don’t know exactly what sets a snorkel fire truck
apart from other kinds of fire trucks, but we can already
imagine its sleek, red beauty gliding gracefully down the
streets of Lexington, which are themselves freshly paved,
thanks to car tax revenue. That’s student dollars at work.

Meanwhile Broomall maintains that the university
supports the students’ fight against the car tax. This latest
allotment, which adds to the $40,000 Broomall says has
been donated to the city so far this academic year, only
strengthens our case, he says. One of the best arguments
against the car tax is that we already give money to the city
via university gifts. Well, Broomall reasons, now we can
make that argument even more forcefully.

‘*Mayor Derrick, if you don’t do something about this car
tax, no more snorkel fire trucks for you!’ ‘

It’s time for the university to take a stand on the car tax
issue and opénly back student concerns. Not handing over
the student car list because of the Buckley Amendment was
a weak endorsement of the student position, but turning
around and handing more money over to the city is just a
stab in the student-body back.

know if I’m the only student whose imaginary car has been
singled out for taxation, but somehow I doubt it. So, warn «
your parents that tax bills may be coming, whether or not
you own a car.

This case raises some important questions about the «
city’s tax policy and the methods it is using to carry it out.

‘

Student chides President Wilson, administration on gallery placement and Delt decision’

 

My VIEW

By Colin J. Wynne, ’94

I have been at Washington and Lee for fifty
weeks, and there have been times at which I felt a
certain indefinable dissatisfaction with, for want of
a better term, ‘‘the way things are done.”’ I have
finally pinpointed the source of this angst, thanks
to a comment made by Prof. Wayne Dymacek.
Recently, in a conversation, he said the following:

 

“Before it makes a decision, the administration

1

should ask itself ‘How will this improve the ‘inter-
action between the ‘faculty and students?’ If their
answer is ‘It will not,’ then the action in question
should not be taken.”’

I came to W&L, as I believe most students
do, because of the particular atmosphere of aca-
demic camaraderie between a student and his
professor that encourages the passing on of knowl-
edge, which is the true strongpoint of the universi-
ty; and the aforementioned interaction is paramount
toward maintaining such a state.

And I feel the administration has done several
things to damage that interaction. Certainly, the
controversy over the Watson Gallery deserves
mention as such. Despite hundreds of signatures

Student strikes
back at critic

To the Editor:

“‘How we infuriate people when we speak
of the things which belong to their peace!’’ The
long-of-memory out there will recall all the
flattering attention I’ve been receiving on these
pages of late. Oddly enough, there have been
sounded amid the babble of imbecilic voices a
few notes worth commenting upon; when the
number of better things I have to do declines, I
may address them. For the moment, though, I
shall take up only one point, raised in the Feb. 27
letter from ‘‘Martha Miller, Law Wife.’’ Since
Martha held us all rapt with her rivetting life
story, I feel justified in answering her on whether
I have ‘‘ever had the opportunity to broaden [my]
visions outside the continental United States.’’

As a matter of fact, Law Wife, I spent the
first 19 years of my life (I am happy to say)
“‘outside the continental United States.’’ I have
drifted through Scotland, England, France, Spain,
Germany, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia,
Greece and spent an entire summer working in
Italy. And in all my travels, I have joined the
intelligent and informed people I have met in
howling with laughter at modern American
“‘democracy.”’

Contrary to my experience of the wide
world, Martha’s convinced of ‘‘just how powerful
the American voting right is...”’ Oh, Martha. Poor
Martha. Don’t you get it? It costs $30 million
even to be considered presidential in contempo-
rary America. No human being who can raise that
kind of money is going to represent the people at
large. He or she (let’s be realistic and say ‘‘he’’)
will represent oil, or aerospace, or banking, or
this-time-I-won’t-take-no-for-an-answer-cut-the-
capital-gains, Above all, he will work for some
sector or sectors of the corporate wealth of the
country, which all reap immense profit — directly
or indirectly — from obscenely inflated ‘‘de-
fense’’ spending. He will be of very little use to
the people who are suffering from the deteriora-
tion of American society. And the people, in
larger and larger numbers, are coming to realize
this.

But all this truth threatens to mar the
sweetly naive afterglow of MC, so I leave off by
noting one final irony. When the proud Law

 

    

protesting the addition of a building to the Colon-
nade, even by several East Asian Studies majors
who feel a strong need for the purpose of the
gallery, the construction goes on as intended by
President Wilson. The faculty, to the best of my
knowledge, had no say in the matter because it was
“not an academic decision,’’ yet the offensive
location was chosen because of the academic
impact it would have on the East Asian Studies
Department. How can a decision which is opposed
by both the faculty and the students be for the

‘benefit of either?
“Also, I was disappointed with the finagling

that occurred after the Student Affairs Committee’s
initial decision concerning Delta Tau Delta fraterni-
ty. I do not have enough knowledge of the situation
personally to claim whether the original decision
was justified or not, nor would I wish to do so.
However, I do understand that, after reviewing the
information of the case, SAC decided on a five-
year suspension of the fraternity in question. Then,
after President Wilson ‘‘interceded,’’ according to
Delt House Corporation President Taylor Cole (in
a quote on the front page of the Feb. 27 issue of
the Phi), the sentence was reduced. The last I
checked, the ‘‘S’’ in SAC stood for ‘‘Student.’’

Delts thank W&L
for support

To the Editor:

The Brothers of Phi chapter of Delta Tau
Delta would like to extend our sincere thanks to
the many individuals involved in the recent
mitigation of our suspension. Without their
efforts, the 100-year history of Delta Tau Delta at
Washington and Lee would surely be drawing to
a close.

We owe our greatest debt to President
Wilson. Were it not for his time, consideration
and insight, our appeal would not have traveled
beyond his desk. His recommendation, in light of
a difficult situation, is greatly appreciated. Fur-
ther, we wish to acknowledge the careful work of
the Student Affairs Committee. SAC’s choice to
reconsider the case and act on President Wilson’s
recommendation was quite honorable. At no time
did the Delt brotherhood feel it would be appro-
priate for SAC to permit the chapter to go with-
Out penalty. We are pleased with the current
decision — both for its fairness and the message
it carries.

Without the support of the IFC, we would
never have chosen to appeal the original SAC
decision. The support of our fellow Greeks was
very important to us and those deciding our
future. We were flattered to receive it.

Enough cannot be said about the selfless
dedication of Phi chapter House Corporation
President Taylor M. Cole, '75. Taylor’s under-
standing, perseverance and diligence have not
gone unnoticed by the chapter. He is deserving of
special pride in the fact that the continued pres-
ence of Delt at Washington and Lee is a direct
result of his hard work. The letters and telephone
calls of our other alumni must also be recognized.
It appears that President Wilson considered the
concern of these men to be a positive force in
shaping the future of Delt. For this concern, we

whose scope are limited thereto should be handled
as such: by students. If Delt had evidence or
circumstances that would have warranted a lesser’
sentence, they should have presented them to SAC,
not President Wilson. Wilson himself adds to the
muddle by claiming ‘‘... the penalty... should’
punish the current chapter without jeopardizing... ,
the fraternity.”” That being the case, he ought to
have kept in mind that the five-year sentence exists’
because that is the length of time in which it can.
reasonably be expected that all current chapter
members will have graduated or otherwise departed ’
from W&L. By his own reasoning, the initial ,
decision should have stood. (Then, with the renova-
tion of the Delt house postponed for some five '
years, the half million or so dollars could be used
to reduce the planned tuition increase...)

All in all, I would hope for President Wilson,

or some of the trustees, to read this and take note.

of one thing: Washington and Lee is an educational
community, a place for professors to teach and
students to learn. Inasmuch as the administration ,
allows that to happen more smoothly, they are
necessary and welcome. But in the end, Washing- '
ton and Lee is for us, the studentc, and not a,

are deeply indebted.

We are quite thankful that at no time
during the past two months were we ever placed
in doubt as to whether we would have the back-
ing of Delta Tau Delta International. They quick-
ly rallied behind us and showed the chapter what
true brotherhood is. We thank them for opening
our eyes.

Lastly, we wish to thank the University
community as a whole. Without the casual posi-
tive comments from our professors, administrators
and fellow students, our morale would have been
instantly defeated. These people showed us that
Delta Tau Delta does occupy a special place at
Washington and Lee.

We appreciate the support and trust that it
will greet the return of Delta Tau Delta in 1993.

Sincerely,

Civility principle
shows CRC’s flaw

To the Editor:

Any member of the W&L community so
naive as to still believe that an administration-
appointed committee can effectively represent his
interests should take a discerning look at the
embarrassingly nonsensical ‘‘Principle of Civility
and Decency’’ recently proposed by the berserk
authoritarian kooks that rule the CRC. Flying in
the face of student opinion and the wishes of the
Board of Trustees, not to mention common sense,
the proposal openly embraces the concept of
political correctness in its lewd and vulgar entire-
ty while offering nothing more than an awkward
machinery for legislating as to the proper expres-
sions of interpersonal respect, something best left
to Emily Post's Book of Etiquette. If Washington
and Lee plans to continue luring prospective
students with grandiose tales of student self-
government, then the principle of honesty dictates
that it should immediately disband the obviously
unrepresentative CRC and return matters of
student discipline to the appropriately-elected
bodies.

speech, Cuomo told reporters he
would ‘‘absolutely not’’ accept a vice
presidential nomination, but New

Mario Cuomo, New York
Gov. — ‘‘Abraham Lincoln.”’

 

York Chairman Jason Robinson said
he nominated Cuomo ‘‘as a gesture of
respect and appreciation.’’

After the balloting for both nomi-
nations was finished, MC Speakers
Chairman Ted Elliott asked journalist
Roger Mudd, a 1950 W&L graduate
who was covering the convention for
PBS, what he had thought of the
proceedings.

‘‘This was a joke,’’ Mudd said.
“‘The national media is calling this a
disgrace. The whole thing was run
rather sloppily, and it’s a big embar-
rassment for W&L.”’

As Mudd spoke, Elliott’s face
turned red and his lips began to quiv-
er. Mudd smiled.

‘‘Just kidding,’’ Mudd and the
other reporters at the press table
laughed. ‘‘This was a fine convention
and a great day.”’

Elliott looked relieved.

mall, the hike in tuition expenses pay for faculty
and staff increased salaries and fringe benefits.

Broomall said the increase will also go to
departmental operating budgets which cover materi-

and travel to conferences.

‘Broomall said that on occasion the tuition
subsidizes other projected expenditures, such as the
Jesse Jackson lecture in 1989. But tuition does not
build galleries or fraternity houses, he said.

In spite of some students’ disapproval of the
tuition increase, some say the hike is necessary.

“The tuition increase is something inevitable in

sophomore Laina Ewan said.

Sara Deutsch seemed pleased with

W&L’s low tuition.

Gallery approval sparks
student jeers and cheers

Many Washington and Lee stu-
dents say they wish the Board of
Trustees had decided to move the
Watson Gallery from its proposed
position on the Colonnade, which the
board approved last month.

Petitions from Sigma Nu, Pi
Kappa Alpha and other student orga-
nizations were signed in protest of the
placement of the building, which
would house an Oriental art collec-
tion.

‘The gallery would be a fine
thing to have if it were somewhere in
the back [of the campus],’’ said Sig-
ma Nu member Tim Wolff, who
signed the petition.

‘I’m not real fond of it,’’ junior
Elizabeth Miller said. ‘‘It would ruin
the look of the Hill.’’

Other students say they like the

idea of an Oriental art gallery, but
agree that the Colonnade would be
too crowded with another addition.
After seeing the building’s architec-
tural design, one student dubbed it
‘*Gaines on the Colonnade.”’

‘*T think it’s a shame to have it
crammed in when there are enough
buildings on the Colonnade already,”’
freshman Chris Albert said. ‘‘While it
might get more use on the Hill, the
collection should be put in or by the
Lenfest Center.’’

Other students, _ particularly
those involved in work-study at the
Reeves Center, approved of the new
addition to the Colonnade.

Landscaping, a sculpture garden
and the art itself ‘‘will enhance the
campus,”’’ freshman Jon Van Dyke
said. ‘‘It should be a good center of
attention around the admissions, sci-
ence, and art buildings; when it’s
built, people will appreciate it more.”’

Ides, CRC clash over report

speech, equal protection or due pro-
cess grounds,’’ the report says.

-» ew 'This does not mean that these,
features of this institution are inappro-

priate,’ the report says. ‘‘Exactly the
opposite, it means that we are free as
a private university to act to meet our
educational mission in ways which
are not open to state schools....”’

Ides says a university should
protect free speech.

‘‘We are educating young peo-
ple who will live both private and
public lives in a democratic society, a
central tenet of which is freedom of
speech,’’ Ides says. ‘‘If speech can be
curbed on campus, why not in more
general contexts?’’

Discriminatory or not?

The report’s commentary refers
to the Principle as ‘‘equally applica-
ble to all students.’’ The report goes
on to explain that if both parties
agree, any case may be tried by the
SCC. But if either the accuser or the
accused wants to keep the matter

private, the CRC must hear the case.

The latter provision is neces-
sary, the report says, because minori-
ties and women have recently become

Mainstream. members at W&L...

“Until we have made substan-

tially more progress on truly integrat- ©

ing all of our students into all facets
of the life of this University, we
ought not dismantle the single Uni-
versity enforcement mechanism that
was identifiably established for the
benefit of women and minority stu-
dents,”’ the report says.

Kelsey, in his dissent, calls this
statement proof that ‘‘a major moti-
vating force behind the policy is the
perception that white, southern males
cannot act responsibly toward any
minority group on this campus.”’

He says of such a targeted poli-
cy, “‘To say that one person’s pain is
any less real because he lacks a histo-
ry of oppression is to ignore the reali-
ties of life.’’

Ides concludes, ‘‘The Principle
is not meant as an invitation to im-
prove oneself, but as a threat to be
enforced through a specified and
organized adversarial process.”’

Frenzied fun.

Washington and Leé’s 20th Mock
Convention was just that, and much more.

The convention kicked off with a bit
of luck on it’s shoulder. The Friday-morning
skies looked like they literally wanted to rain
on the parade.

“Its like
someone was looking
down on us,” said
Dean of Students
David Howison.

Sophomore
Nathan Dunn, a del-
egate from Alabama,
said the parade was a
huge success.

“Everyone’s
having so much fun,”
Dunn said, “that’s
what it’s all about.”

For most
students this was the
first and last MC they
will experience. Many
said they believed that
this contributed to the
anticipation and ex-
citement of the event.

“The excit-
ing thing is that it’s
new toeveryone,” said
Roger Sullivan, a Vir-
ginia delegate.

Another
Virginia delegate,
Caroline Tsuji, said
she thought a good aspect of the convention
was that it was one of the few Washington and
Lee events that did not revolve around the
fraternity system.

“T like it because there are no barri-
ers,” Tsuji said. “It’s been a positive atmo-
sphere everywhere I’ve been.”

The prevalent opinion of students
and faculty was that the convention surpassed

any of their expectations.

“T was really surprised everything
went off,” said Illinois delegate Muriel Neel.
“It’s one of the best times I’ve ever had at
W&L.”

Robert Wilson, a delegate from
Texas, said that the massive event was well-
executed and that he was astonished at the
media coverage.

“It’s more far-reaching than I ever
thought,” he said.

said he received calls from several friends
around the country saying they had heard
about MC on television.

In keeping with what Director of

“strong commitment to having a good time,”
the feeling of the convention floor was elec-
tric. However, some delegates had hangovers

playing the proper convention enthusiasm.

“It’s like Fancy Dress only political,”
Michigan delegate Krista Taurins said.

Others said MC was more of aconve-
nient precursor to FD,

“Mock Convention makes scamming
for FD dates a lot easier,” said one female
student.

Another student, however, said he
hopes delegates at real conventions are more
sober than W&L students were.

“Tf this is the
way the real con-
vention runs, we're

Ohio delegate
Andy Barrick said.

Morrison (right) and his sparring partner during a workout at VMI.

Boxer trains at VMI

 

By JAMESON LEONARDI
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Heavyweight boxer and actor Tommy
“The Duke” Morrison is currently training at
Virginia Military Institute for a March 20 fight
against Wimpy Halstead on ESPN.

The 23-year-old fighter has amassed
a 29-1 record and is a contender for a champi-
onship fight as early as 1993. Morrison had
been ranked as high as eighth by the World
Boxing Council, but after his loss to Ray
Mercer, his WBC ranking dropped to 18th.

Ring Magazine editor Steve Farhood
said he believes that Morrison is a good fighter
with a lot of talent.

“Morrison is very strong and has an
excellent left hook,” Farhood said. “He also
has good size and good punching ability.”

However, Farhood also quickly
pointed out that Morrison needs to do a lot of
work before he gets a championship fight.

“Heneeds to work on his stamina and
defense,” he said. “He also needs to learn to
relax in the ring.”

Morrison’s trainer is Dr. Tom
Virgetts, a former assistant professor at VMI.
The boxer said Virgetts is responsible for
bringing him to VMI.

“{Virgetts] used to coach here from
1979 to 1985,” Morrison said. “It’s a great
atmosphere to be in if you want to totally get
away from everything. It’s almost like being in
prison.”

While at VMI, Morrison said he is
working to improve his defense and add more
weapons to his boxing arsenal.

“My left hook is something I’ve been
noted for for along time” he said. “As you rise
in competition, your opponents get tougher
and you have to learn to rely on other parts of
your arsenal.”

Morrison said he sees a weakness in

“Several young fighters haven’t blos-

“The weakness opens the door for
{Foreman and Holmes] to come back in make

said. “It’s something that isn’t going to last

Morrison said. “He has expressed an interest in

maybe a small percentage of my contract that
would go to the charity of my choice.”

Morrison said he sees himself going

Wynton Marsalis and his band will be bringing their form of traditional Jazz to the Lenfest Center on Sunday March 15.

Marsalis grooves into Lenfest

 

By DAVID WILMINGTON
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Wynton Marsalis once said of Duke Ellington’s devotion to jazz and
the blues, “Somewhere out there are the kind of people who will not accept the
premature autopsy of a noble art form.” Marsalis, who will play two shows at
the Lenfest Center March 15, might as well have been describing himself.

With the release of his latest project, a three-part blues cycle collectively
entitled Soul Gestures in Southern Blue, Marsalis has solidified and epitomized
his personal approach to jazz.

He sums up this development as “‘comprehensive and always dealing
with the fundamentals of the music.” For him, the fundamental is, of course, the
blues.

Marsalis says that the “high usage” of the blues is what ties all great
jazz musicians together. The term “high usage” refers to the manipulation and
mastery of all aspects of the blues: the chord changes themselves, the instrumental
technique, the emotional expression and the “groove.”

Despite its disco connotation, the groove is a complex rhythmic
accompaniment to the melodies and harmonies supplied by the horns, piano and
bass.

The man responsible for providing this groove since 1988 is Herlin
“Homey” Riley, the drummer in Marsalis’ band.

During an interview Monday, Riley described Marsalis’ approach to
music as “meticulous,” noting that he considers this the mark of a professional
musician.

He said that playing Marsalis’ music requires great sensitivity to the
subtle changes and definite forms involved.

“It’s not just a bunch of guys getting together to play a gig,” Riley said.

However, Riley said that Marsalis’ clearly delineated forms still allow
plenty of room for expressive soloing.

Riley said his own theory of playing drums consists of “keeping good
time and laying down a cushion of rhythm for the rest of the band.”

His ultimate goal in 2reating music, Riley said, is toreach acompromise
between satisfying himself, the other members of the band, musicians in the
house and the audience.

Riley said that the “instrumental pop music” that masquerades as jazz
is making it difficult for serious young musicians to learn the traditions
necessary to treat jazz as an art. This is an opinion that Marsalis has been known
to express frequently as well, much to the chagrin of the producers of commercial
jazz impostors.

Despite early pressures from the recording industry to produce such
instrumental pop music, Mar salis stuck to the traditions taught by his father and
the legendary drummer and alent scout Art Blakey. The result of his ongoing
history lessons is a startling new style that earns the right to be called new by the
very fact that it encompasses and utilizes so much of the old.

Cuomo
impressed
by MC

By JOSHUA MANNING
Phi Staff Reporter

 

 

Arriving on the Mock Conven-
tion platform 15 minutes late as hun-
dreds of delegates cheered ‘‘draft
Cuomo,”’ perennial presidential possi-
bility and three-term New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo delivered a keynote
address Saturday which catapulted
him into a mock vice-presidential
nomination.

“I’m extremely impressed with
how they do it here,’’ Cuomo said
during a brief press conference after
the speech. ‘‘I went on stage assum-
ing that this was the real Democratic
convention,”’

Rumors that Cuomo might use
the appearance to enter the presiden-
tial race just in time for Super Tues-
day did not come true. The gover-
nor’s speech focused on the failures
of twelve years of Republican presi-
dents.

The Republicans, he said, took
a ‘‘radical theory that failed 65 years
ago’’ called trickle-down, or supply-
side, economics and put it into use.
The current recession is the result of
that failure, Cuomo said.

“*Supply-side wound up supply-
ing the wealthy with bread from the
poor and middle class,’’ Cuomo said.

Accompanying this economic
policy, he continued, were failed at-
tempts at reform, the destruction of
the welfare system, the abandoning of
American cities and the Supreme
Court’s intrusion into personal liber-
ties.

‘*The American dream is gradu-
ally fading as the president seems less
and less capable of leading us to
higher ground,’’ cried Cuomo. ‘‘Even
now, in this winter of our economic
discontent, he has held his course:
straight for the cliff.’’

Cuomo said Bush’s greatest
problem is that he has been unable to
admit that problems exist. Instead he
said the president has been blaming
the powerless for the problems his
administration has created.

“‘Let’s do less blaming and
more building.’’ Cuomo said. ‘‘We
need a whole plan, a real, effective
economic growth strategy based on
inclusion, not exclusion.’’

Cuomo called for a Democratic
agenda based on health care, job
training, family leave for women.

other economic superpowers, a focus
on rebuilding the infrastructure of
American cities and a variety of plans
to help children and students.

““This is not just a handout,’’
Cuomo said. ‘‘We do this as an in-
vestment in our human resources.”’

Cuomo said the money to fund
these programs already exists, it just
needs to be discovered.

said. ‘““How can you say that we have
not the wealth to deal with these
problems? It’s simply a matter of
priorities.”’

The next president of the United
States will have to make many hard
choices, Cuomo said.

‘The Republicans have pro-
duced a calamity,’’ Cuomo said. ‘‘As
in 1932, the Democrats will lead us
out of it, away from the cliff.

What if the Democrats threw a
convention, passed a Republican
platform, and nobody came?

By the time the Mock Conven-
tion platform debate ended Friday
night, two things were clear. First,
that the majority of students believe
that the Democrats should adopt more
conservative positions. Second, the
majority of delegates didn’t care to
discuss the platform in the first place.

There were 869 delegate ballots
cast on the first contested plank, but
fewer than 300 on the third.

“‘L_was pleasantly surprised with
how the debate went, and that a lot of
people stayed around,’’ said Platform
Committee Chairman Heath Dixon.
“It wasn’t of the highest academic
quality, but some relevant things were
said. After all, it was Friday night and
people had been drinking.”’

“The platform is necessary to
the convention,”’ said Virginia Chair-
man John Flippen. ‘‘But I think ev-
erybody was ready to go to their keg
parties.’’

All the speakers at the conven-
tion proposed what they called a
‘New Vision’’ for the Democratic
party: a breaking away from the tra-
ditional, liberal moorings that have
characterized the party since the time
of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

And the platform drafted and
passed by the convention reflects this
new, more moderate stance.

Although it contained some
traditional Democratic planks, such as
support for ‘‘reproductive freedom’”’
and reduced defense spending, the
platform’s positions on such issues as
tax credits for industry to encourage
research and development and the
possible elimination of some affir-
mative action programs are much
more conservative than those of past
Democratic platforms.

“It think it’s clear that you can
look around the country and see
things that aren’t going the way they

 

should, even if you’re a Republican,”’ .

Dixon said before the convention.
‘*We tried to propose things that are
different from the traditional, liberal,
interest group platforms that the Dem-
ocrats have put out before.’’

During most of the convention,
delegates were supposed to act like
their real-life counterparts, even if

pass.

a

they had to fake it. But the platform °
debate gave students the chance to «
support their own conservative views.

The platform committee spon- —
sored debate on three of the many
issues addressed in the 12-page docu-
ment. On each of these issues, the —
traditionally-Republican student body
voted overwhelming for the more
conservative of their options.

The first contested issue was
gun control. The platform stated,
““We are opposed to the ease with
which guns may be purchased, ...we »
support federal control of the pur-
chasing process.”

Senior Will Thomas, a member »
of the MC Steering Committee, pre- _
sented the.convention with another,
more conservative option, which ,
eventually was passed 516-353.

“‘Gun control has to be handled
by the states, not the federal govern-
ment,’’ Thomas said. ‘‘Why spend
millions of dollars on a program we
know won’t work?”

The second contested issue
concerned health care. Midwest Re-
gional Coordinator Cottie Miles «
presented a more liberal position than ,
that of the platform: that medical
care, like legal representation, should »
be given freely to those who can’t |
afford it. The minority report was
rejected easily by the convention.

“Health care is already supplied
in an adequate way,’’ Mississippi
Delegation Chairman Richard Yates °
said in response to Miles. ‘“‘To na- |
tionalize it would threaten our right to
the best health care possible.’’

The final issue was tax reform.
Platform Committee member Todd
Ammermann proposed in his minority °
report, which also passed easily, the
same 13-percent flat tax espoused by
Democratic candidate Jerry Brown.

“For too long, we have thought
that to raise taxes was the only solu-
tion,’” Ammermann said. ‘‘What we
need is tax simplicity and fairness.”’

But perhaps the most attention-
getting issue on the convention floor
was on a sign in the California dele-
gation that read ‘‘The Right To Bear
All Full Frontal Nudity.”’

“‘If you’ve got the right to bear
arms, then you’ve got the right to
bare anything else,’’ said Melton, one
of the two delegates holding the sign.
“‘All these issues should be up to the
states. This is just a way to grab .
people’s attention.”’

Although the focus was sup-
posed to be on national issues, it was
the local car tax issue that drew the
attention of speakers in the opening
session of Mock Convention.

Washington and Lee President
John Wilson made the first reference
to the tax in an address welcoming
the convention to W&L. The speech
poked fun at university food, the city
and even the president himself,

“‘While you are here, we invite
you to dine at our four-star restaurant,
visit Old George guarding our cups
and saucers in the Reeves Center and
make sure you register your automo-
bile with the grand assessor of tax-
es,’’ Wilson said.

U.S. Representative Buddy
Darden, D-Ga., told students they
should register to vote in the city if
they wanted to abolish the tax and
pointed to the tax as an example of
why people should vote.

“They are going to do it to you
like this your whole life unless you
vote,’’ Darden said.

Virginia. Democratic Party
Chairman Paul Goldman even invited
students to ‘‘come down and talk to

U.S. Representative Jim Olin (D-Va.) addresses the Mock Convention’s first session.

later said about the offer. ‘‘It sounds
like taxation without representation to
me. I'd be happy to share my experi-
ence and help you talk to people [in
State government].’’

through the afternoon session was the
irony of a largely conservative student
body pretending to be Democrats.

U.S. Representative Jim Olin,
D-Va., got a laugh when he beg2n his
speech by addressing the crowd as
“Fellow Democrats....’’

“When you're older and

The Washington and Lee
men’s lacrosse team has yet to gel
completely this year. The Generals
can play one strong quarter and
follow it with a not-so-strong quarter.

Just take Saturday's game at
Franklin & Marshall.

In the second quarter, the
Generals erased a 3-0 Diplomats lead
to take a 4-3 halftime lead. The
Generals led 6-4, but were shut out in
the fourth quarter as the Diplomats
rallied for a 9-6 win.

“I thought we did a good job
coming back from the early hole,”’
said head coach Jim Stagnitta. ‘‘But
we didn’t play very well, and that put
us in a position where anything could
happen in the fourth quarter, and it
did.”’

The Generals had to kill off
five fourth quarter penalties and never
had a legitimate opportunity mount an
offensive threat. But it wasn’t the
fourth quarter penalties that did W&L

in.

‘*We didn’t shoot the ball well
early,’ Stagnitta said. ‘““We had
opportunities in the second quarter to
put the game away, and we didn’t.
We got stuffed a couple of times, and
we need to convert those shots.”’

W&L scored just six goals on
their 32 shots. Juniors John Hunter
and Wiemi Douoguih each scored
twice to lead the Generals.

The loss to the 13th-ranked
Diplomats served as a wake-up call
for the Generals, ranked seventh in
Division III.

““You never like to lose a
game,’’ said Stagnitta, ‘‘but maybe
we can learn from this loss.”’

The Generals showed some
improvement on Wednesday against
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
foe Lynchburg, but still followed a
good quarter with a not-so-good one.

Stagnitta knew going into the
game that Lynchburg would be a
challenge for his team.

‘“‘Every single time we walk
out on the field, it’s a challenge,’’ he

said. ‘‘We need to play well and
hard, because if we don’t, we’re not
good enough to win.”’

WA&L jumped out to a 5-1 lead
after the first quarter sparked by two
goals from sophomore Colin Higgins,
but watched as Lynchburg took a 6-5
lead late in the second quarter.

The Hornets’ run woke the
Generals up. Douoguih scored to tie
the game at 6-6, senior Drew Anton
scored just 16 seconds before
halftime, and Douoguih scored early
in the second half to give the
Generals an 8-6 lead on the way to a
16-9 win.

Lynchburg made the score 8-7,
but Hunter started W&L on an 8-2
run to finish the game. Hunter’s goal,
his second of the day, was followed
by goals from senior Jeff Roberts and
Anton before the Hornets scored
again to make it 11-8.

The Generals broke the game
open with two straight goals from
junior David Schiminger, the second

coming off an alley-oop feed from
Douoguih.

Douoguih and Anton led
W&L with four goals and an assist
each. Hunter, sophomore Colin
Higgins and Schiminger each added
two goals.

Senior goalie Coleman Devlin
anchored the defense. Devlin saved
12 of the 29 shots he saw. Lynchburg
managed just 11 second-half shots.

W&L improved to 3-2 on the
season, 2-0 in the ODAC. The
Generals will put their 10-game
ODAC winning streak on the line
against 1lth-ranked arch-rival
Roanoke in a game that is important
if W&L wants to return to the NCAA
Division III tournament.

“*TWith the loss to F&M], we
get to see what this team is made
of,’’ said Stagnitta. ‘‘If its goal is to
make it to the tournament, then we’ve
got our work cut out for us.”’

W&L begins its home
schedule on Wednesday. The
Generals host Virginia Wesleyan.

Baseball drops tough double-dip

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE
Phi Staff Reporter

One of the most difficult tasks
for a coach is to keep a team’s
confidence level up after a loss.

Washington and Lee baseball
coach Jeff Stickley has the unenviable
task of trying to keep his young
team’s confidence high after a
double-header loss to Mary
Washington College on Sunday.

However, Coach  Stickley
doesn’t think it will be that difficult.

‘*They’re [MWC] a good
team, a legit tournament team,”” said
Stickley. ‘“‘I think that type of
competition is good for us, it helps
gain experience. I don’t think the
guys are down, we had some decent
opportunities against a very good
team.”’

The Generals did have some
good opportunities in the first game,
but they just couldn’t seem to

 

Senior Richard Yates hammers a forehand in a recent match. Yates
helped lead W&L to a 5-4 win over Hampden-Sydney.

capitalize. Their best chance came in
the second inning of the first game.

With the Eagles up 2-0, senior
T.J. Daly lead off the inning with a
walk, freshman Bates Brown followed
with a single and junior Pete
Klinglehofer followed that with
another single, but Daly couldn’t
score. A double-play and a ground
out killed the rally, though.

‘*We had bases loaded and no
outs, but we just couldn’t get any
runs across,” said Stickley. ‘It was a
good opportunity for us, but it wasn’t
totally disheartening.”’

The Generals held their own
until the bottom of the fourth, when
the Eagles exploded for five runs.
They followed that up with a six-run
fifth to put the game out of reach.

The Generals did make a mini-
comeback in the seventh when they
scored five runs on four hits, but
couldn’t get any closer. The Eagles
claimed the first game 13-5.

The Generals had a chance to
redeem themselves in the unscheduled
night-cap, but it wasn’t to be. Mary
Washington picked up right where
they left off in game one. Six players
crossed home plate in the bottom of
the first and two more in the bottom
of the second.

MWC held the Generals to
just two hits and no runs, and swept
the Generals by winning the second
game 8-0.

Brown had an excellent day
for the Generals going 4-for-6 and
raising his season average to .313.
Klinglehofer also had a good double-
header by going 2-for-6.

off to a disappointing start with a

for.

Tennis extends streak

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE
Phi Staff Reporter

 

It’s been ten years since the
Washington and Lee men’s tennis
team lost an Old Dominion Athletic
Conference match. The last team to
top the Generals was Hampden-
Sydney.

Last Thursday the Tigers came
close to ending the Generals decade-
long hold over ODAC opponents. But
W&L squeaked by, 5-4, to extend its
ODAC winning streak to 29,

“Tt ended up being a good

el match for us,” said head coach Gary

Franke.

The Generals took the match
with their singles line-up. Richard
Yates, Robby MacNaughton, Tom
Mazziotti, Wes Ruggles and David
Schweppe all recorded victories. It
took a three-set victory by Mazziotti
at No. 3 singles to clinch it for the
Generals. Mazziotti won the nail-biter

way they’re going to get better is to
face better hitters. I believe they’ll
start to come around and get things
together,’’said Stickley.

“Scoring runs was a problem.
Bates Brown had a good day, but we
weren’t hitting well as a team, and
that’s the only way we're going to
win.”’

The Generals dropped to 2-4
on the season and they were supposed
to start their 1992 Old Dominion
Athletic Conference season at home
Tuesday against Bridgewater but the
game was rained out. It is
rescheduled for Monday at 3 p.m.

So, instead of Bridgewater the
Generals will open the ODAC season
at home against Eastern Mennonite
today. They will stay home for a
double-header on Saturday against
another ODAC rival, Randolph-
Macon.

6-4, 4-6, 6-3. He was the last singles
player to finish, and his win insured
the team win for W&L, regardless of
doubles.

‘*‘We won third singles, so we
had them beaten,’’ said Franke. ‘‘I
believe we just let up a little too
much in the doubles and lost them.”’

The win upped the Generals
season mark to 4-0, 3-0 in the
ODAC. However, Franke still isn’t
sure if his team is where it should be.

‘It’s kind of hard to tell if the
kids are match-tough yet,’’ he said.

The Generals played James
Madison today. It is the first of three
tough matches for the Generals. After
hosting JMU, W&L hits the road for
matches at Emory and Davidson on
Saturday and Sunday, respectively.
Both are ranked natioanlly.

“‘They’re going to be tough
matches, and either way it turns out
it’ll tell me where the team stands.”’

Generals win three straight

 

By JACOB KIMBALL
Phi Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee
women’s lacrosse team opened the
1992 season with three straight wins
against conference opponents.

In the best start in school
history, W&L ran off impressive
victories against Old Dominion
Athletic Conference foes Guilford,
Sweet Briar, and Bridgewater.

The Generals have done it
with offense and defense alike. That
control was most apparent in a re-
cord-breaking performance against
SBC.

The Generals poured in 19
goals, the highest total in W&L histo-
ry, and also recorded the first shutout
ever in the 19-0 win over the Vixens.

In a game filled with individu-

al stars, Annie Salisbury led the way
with five goals and three assists for a
school-record eight points. Lisa
Dowling had four goals and an assist,
and both Paige Henke and Nicole
Ripken netted three goals each.

The team showed the potential
to improve on last year’s record in
the first game of the season, as they
easily handled Guilford 15-2.

W&L was led offensively by
Dowling and Angie Carrington. Each
had four goals and two assists. Kim
Bishop also contributed four goais.

On Wednesday, Bridgewater
gave the Generals a closer game, but
the Generals still were able to control
the game, winning 8-4.

The Generals will attempt to
continue their winning ways at Ran-
dolph-Macon on Saturday.

water at the NCAA Championship
meet at the University of Buffalo.

It is Dudley’s third straight
trip to the NCAA meet. She will
swim in the 200-yard individual
medley, the 50-yard freestyle, the
100-yard breaststroke and the 200-
yard breaststroke.

Dudley earned All-America
honors as a freshman. She is the
lone W&L women’s swimmer at
the championships. Senior Doug
Brown and freshman John Rowe
will represent the men’s team next
weekend.

 

Washington and Lee’s golf
team, a top 10 finisher at the last
two NCAA Division III Champion-
ships, tees it up for the first time in
1992 this weekend at the Gordin
Collegiate Classic in Surfside
Beach, S.C.

 

The event is one of the
most prestigious in any division of
collegiate golf and draws the best
teams in Division II]. W&L fin-
ished seventh in last year’s event.

The Generals will be led by
All-American seniors Brad Tho-
burn, Jay McKnight and Clay
Thomas. Cliff Burrow and Pearce
Smithwick will also make the trip
to the Gordin Classic.

The Washington and Lee
Athletics Promotions Committee is
sponsoring ‘‘Varsity Days’’ this
spring. The goal is to get athletes
from each out-of-season team to
come out and support in-season
athletes. Other students are wel-
come to support teams as well.

On Friday, there will be
two events sponsored. At the track
meet against Bridgewater, the
W&L Food Services will be giving
away free food and drinks for
everyone who attends. At the
women’s tennis match against
Denison, free Domino’s Pizza will
be given away.

Folline
fined in
DUI case

By RICK PELTZ
Phi Editor

 

 

Senior Class President and
Student Conduct Committee mem-
ber Joseph Read Folline was found
guilty Tuesday of driving with a
blood-alcohol level greater’ than .1
percent, a misdemeanor.

“Tt didn’t get a raw deal,”
Folline said Wednesday. “I was above
the legal limit and should not have
been driving.”

Folline also reaffirmed his
Feb. 5 statement that the incident
would have no effect on his judgment
as an SCC member.

“I’ve already been ques-
tioned about this,” Folline said. “I
don’t think you [The Ring-tum Phi]
have to bring it up again.”

Folline pled not guilty in
Lexington-Rockbridge Combined
General District Court.

Judge Joseph E. Hess fined
Folline $200 and restricted his driv-
ing to work- and school-related ac-
tivities. The fine may be suspended,
the judge ordered, if Folline partici-
pates in an alcohol awareness pro-
gram.

Folline’s defense was in part
based on his leadership at W&L and
his character. Folline’s attorney, Gor-
don F. Saunders, noted Folline’s sta-
tus as class president and presented a

letter from Dean of Students David

L. Howison. attesting to Folline’s
character.

“[When I met Folline,] 1 was
immediately impressed with his good
temperament, his intellectual insight,
and the good-natured manner he dem-
onstrated in dealing with people,”
Howison wrote.

Lexington Police Officer
Matthew J. Bennett said after he pulled
Folline over, Folline performed
poorly in roadside sobriety tests and
then failed a breathalizer field test.
Bennett arrested him and took him to
the police station for a breathalizer
test, where he blew a .15 blood-alco-
hol level.

FD returns to the age of explorers

 

 

By Joyce BAUTISTA
Phi Staff Reporter

This year Fancy Dress goers will
embark on “A Return Voyage to the Age of

Exploration,” which will focus on the famed -

and fabled voyages of Christopher oe

i which began in 1492.

In 1992, vast amounts of money will
be expended all over the world on
quincentennial parades, statues and festivals
commemorating Columbus’ voyages. Yet some
people will splash blood-red paint on Colum-
bus statues and others have said they will hang
Columbus in effigy and try him in planned
tribunals.

Fancy Dress Vice-Chairman Lewis
Perkins said he hoped no controversy would
result from this year's theme.

“T don't see why it [the theme] needs
to be controversial,” he said. “This is a party.”

Most of the modern Columbus con-
troversy centers on his treatment of the natives
he encountered during his journeys. Some

critics say Columbus readily took advantage of the
natives, asking them where he could find the hordes
of gold that would make his mission worthwhile to
his Spanish sponsors. The critics say Columbus took
natives to Spain as slaves, and that he wrote about
what good servants the “Indians” would make.

 

~ Conversely, others say Columbus respected
the natives, that he used them as guides and transla-
tors. Such critics point out that he ultimately forbade
unfair trading between sailors and natives. Colum-
bus reported to the Spanish monarchs that the na-

tives could be converted to Christianity eas-
ily; he initially thought, incorrectly, that they
had no religion at all.

The critics also say Columbus’ po-
etic musings on the magnificence of the land
and the ignorance of the people probably
served as well to impress the king and queen
as to reflect Columbus’ own impressions. His
letters to the Spanish monarchs, critics argue,
are unreliable sources in determining Colum-
bus’ true thoughts and intentions, because his
audience was anticipating tales of gold and
opportunity.

According to Newsweek writer
David Gates, “Like heroes from Julius Cae-
sar to John Kennedy, Christopher Columbus
has mostly been who people want him to be.”

“Columbus sometimes exaggerated,
misinterpreted and just plain lied, particularly
in overselling the islands he discovered,” ac-
cording to Gates. For example, during his
first voyage Columbus reportedly kept two

Students
denied
voting

By THOMAS EISENHAUER
Phi Senior Copy Editor

 

 

Sophomore Ryan Dennard
Monday appealed to a Rockbridge
County Circuit Court judge to re-
verse a decision by the Lexington
registrar that prevents him from reg-
istering to vote here.

Dennard said he tried to reg-
ister last Tuesday but was rejected by
the registrar, Lucille Joyce, who deter-
mined that he was not a Lexington
resident. He said he wants to partici-
pate in local party politics.

Joyce also would not allow
sophomore Matt Jackson or first-year
law student Chris Kowalczuk to regis-
ter Monday. Kowalczuk said he will
try to register today and file suit in
federal court if he is refused.

“I do live here for nine
months, and they are taxing me,” he
said. “I have no intention of paying
the car tax until this is resolved.”

The Virginia Constitution
says that a person can vote in the area
of his “domicile and place of abode.”

Normally, Joyce said, a per-
son can register if he claims to live in
Lexington and gives a street address.

But Joyce played “word ga-
mes” with Dennard in order to deter-
mine that he does not fit the require-
ments, he said. When he argued that
he claims Lexington as his place of
residence, Dennard said, Joyce threat-
ened to charge him with perjury.

In January 1990, the Lex-
ington Electoral Board ruled that stu-
dents can vote in Lexington , and that
the registrar cannot discriminate
against them.

Dennard’s appeal will be
decided by Judge George E. Honts
III. Joyce said, “Judge Honts ruled
before that students are transients.”

All three students said they
believe Joyce is trying to prevent stu-
dents from voting.

“She said, ‘I am the law in
Lexington when it comes to voting,’”
Kowalczuk said.

Washington and Lee spokesmen say
auniversity donation of $50,000 to the city of
Lexington to replace an outdated fire truck is
unrelated to the car tax issue, but many stu-
dents disagree.

WA&L Director of Communications
Brian Shaw said that replacing the city’s 35-
year-old snorkel fire truck is necessary be-
cause the truck is designed to fight fires in
multi-story buildings like Gaines Hall, Gra-
ham-Lees, and the barracks at Virginia Mili-
tary Institute.

“Student lives would be put at risk if
the city did not have this truck,” Shaw said.
“Tying the car tax issue in with the money for
this fire truck is bullshit.”

Sophomore David McDannald dis-
agreed. He said he would support giving the
city money if it would drop the car tax.

“‘We shouldn’t be giving both ways,”
McDannald said.

City Manager T. Jon Ellestad said
the city also asked VMI, the city of Buena
Vista, and Rockbridge County to help pay for
the truck, which could be sent to fight fires
anywhere in Rockbridge County. But only

 

W&L will allot $10,000 annually
for the next five years for the $50,000 dona-
tion, according to W&L Treasurer Larry
Broomall.

Broomall said that W&L gives the
city about $55,000 a year, not including the
fire truck donation,
because W&L is ex-
empt from property
taxes, but uses many
city services.

According to
Ellestad, W&L stu-
dents pay about
$70,000 per year in
car taxes,

—~ Ellestad
Shaw said the city had
saved $200,000 toward the purchase of the
$600,000 truck, but the money had to be
spent when another fire truck broke down.

Ellestad said the city will save money
for 5 or 6 years before buying the new truck.

Sophomore Jason Dunn said that
students already share an unfair tax burden in
Lexington.

“They should be catering to us. We
already give them enough money by support-

Broomall said the city has made spe-
cial requests for money from the university
before.

Three years ago W&L donated
$100,000 to help the city build a new high
school because many faculty members have
children in public school here.

Broomall said the two requests are
similar because they both go to projects that
benefit the university.

In other news pertaining to the car
tax, Executive Committee President Giles
Perkins said on March 9 that he might support
some action to shield students from the car
tax.

Perkins said on March 9 he would
consider endorsing a boycott of city busi-
nesses like the one that was called off last
winter by then-EC President Tom Hatcher.

Hatcher preferred to try further me-
diation with the city, saying the boycott would
injure merchants who are not responsible for
levying the tax.

Perkins asked first-year law EC Rep.
Bill Callahan and second-year law EC Rep.
Jay Sterne to evaluate student options under
Virginia law and report to the EC Monday.

Sexy enough to win MTV’s Lip
Service contest in Daytona Beach, Fla., on
Sunday, giving Washington and Lee its sec-
ond Lip Service win in three years,

After winning second place in the
W&L SAMS Rock-Alike contest, Stickboy
and the Catwalks were chosen to compete at
the MTV contest, performing “I’m Too Sexy.”

The competitions pitted the group

of Drew Hammond, Phil Harries, Michael

against other college competitors.

In addition to winning a trophy and
various gifts from Coca-Cola for themselves,
a check for $5,000 will be given to Students
Against Multiple Sclerosis in SPE’s name.

“The most exciting part was com-
peting and just being there with all those
celebrities,” Neal said.

The group can be seen on MTV’s

Che Ring-tum Phi

Founded September 18, 1897

Don’t confuse
freedom and libel

In a true act of cowardice, someone last weekend
covered the campus with fliers accusing some members of
Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity of committing sex crimes and
others of allowing sex crimes to go unreported. The
posters were signed only with a pen name.

If the distributors of the fliers have evidence of a
crime, they should report it to authorities. The First
Amendment protects free expression, even anonymous
expression, but never libel.

The only purpose one-sided accusations like the fliers
serves is to make unfounded accusations without fear of
reprisal and free debate. That seems to idicate that the
accusor has something to hide.

Let’s set the
record straight

Throughout this year we have faced accusations of
insensitivity and sensationalism in our coverage. Many
students have accused us of using the power of the press
to undermine the community of trust at Washington and
Lee. Without addressing any single instance from the year,
we want to clarify our position.

The Ring-tum Phi is a newspaper. It is run by students,
it serves the W&L community, and it receives funding
from student government. But in the end, it is still a
newspaper. As such, it shares standards of professionalism
and ethics with every other respectable newspaper, from
The News-Gazette and The Rockbridge Weekly to The New
York Times, and yes, even USA Today. To some extent,
every newspaper must take into consideration the needs
and desires of the community it serves. And to some
extent, every newspaper has a responsibility to inform,
even when the published product is not palatable to the
community. So we walk a fine line.

Many students have told us that we should compromise
our professional standards because we are not a ‘‘real’’
newspaper. What they fail to understand is that no matter
what our standards are, no matter what we publish or do
not publish, facts will not change. Students have two
choices: to be ignorant of the facts or to be informed. The
role of journalists has always been, and will always be, to
create an informed public, a public well-equipped to make
decisions. As journalists, we cannot abdicate that
responsibilty. We would do everyone a disservice by
pretending that W&L is enclosed in a glass bubble, safe
from the unpleasantness of the outside world.

In order to fulfill our responsibilities, we have to do
the same things ‘‘real’’ journalists do. We make editorial
decisions about what stories are newsworthy, how they
should play in the paper, what the angle of coverage
should be, and so on. That is our job. That is what we
are here at W&L to learn to do more effectively. We do
not object to criticism; to the contrary, we invite it.

But we are disappointed when criticism reflects an
ignorance of what print journalism is. It is absurd to say
that the Phi covers something poorly because, to take a
common example, the university administration is offended
by the story. We are not in the business of making people
happy or sad. We are in the business of communication
and information.

We are also disappointed when critics attack members
of our staff personally and accuse them of malice and
intentional bias. We do not tolerate malice or intentional
bias of staff members in the performance of their duties.
And like any respectable newspaper, we do our very best
to filter out all bias. We always strive for objectivity.

The Ring-tum Phi is a newspaper. It observes. It
informs. It plays the role of watchdog. We do not ask that

you like what we print. We do ask that you understand
why we do it.

with speech?

LET IT RIDE

 

By Chris Swann

 

Last week, I read about the new CRC idea for protect-
ing those molested by language deemed unsuitable for ,
public hearing. Just what I need in college, a babysitter.
Two weeks ago, we conducted a major political experiment '
involving the presidential race. I believe now it is time to ,
examine our own campus government before it turns nasty.

According to the new proposal, free speech doesn’t
apply to Washington and Lee students. Anybody remember
signing a statement to that effect upon entering our school? °
Maybe it was somewhere
between the descriptions
of the Honor System and’
fraternity Rush, ‘‘Oh, and ,
by the way, no cursing or
it’s sayonara!’’ I’d like to’
examine the possible cir-,
cumstances of this little
codicil, if I may (of course’
I can, it’s my column). —_,

First off, all works of literature in our student library
containing any obscene or racial language must be bumed.”
I’ve always had a burning desire to torch The Confessions ,
of Nat Turner or The Catcher in the Rye. And forget great
works by black authors, like Native Son, because it has the’
word “‘nigger’’ in it. Gather round the bonfire, boys and,
girls, I’m just getting warmed up.

Next, let’s forget the theme parties on campus. Old*
South will definitely have to go because non-Southermers
might feel left out, and those attending obviously think

 

Gather round the
bonfire, boys and
girls, it’s time

to take the CRC’s
new idea to its
logical extreme.

My VIEW

By Donald E. Jeffrey, 84, °92L

 

It is interesting that a majority of the CRC
has so summarily discarded the Constitutional
protection of free speech. The majority notes
that there are aspects of our Honor, fraternity
and student conduct systems which would
also violate the Constitution but that a private
school may do so to advance an ‘‘educational
mission.”’

How convenient to ignore that the CRC
stands alone in this group, because of its
embryonic nature. If we discard the Consti-
tution on the issue of free speech, what’s
next? Compulsory chapel services?

Part of W&L’s educational mission is to
expose people to diverse viewpoints. Mére- “'

over, the univérsity has been committed to
student self-government. This is why the
school can operate the Honor System so well.
Should we eschew all of this just to make
sure that no one ever gets his feelings hurt?

Faculty or deans should be involved in
rape cases. However, I remain opposed to the
CRC’s ‘‘offensive speech’’ role. Several of
the assumptions underlying the CRC’s role
here are repugnant. First, the CRC implies
that white male students are incapable of
adjudicating cases of conduct with racist or
sexist overtones. Yet, as I was writing this
letter, I read an article in the school newspa-
per from the predominantly white, predomi-
nantly Virginian, all-male, Hampden-Sydney
about a three-semester suspension meted out
to a white student who apparently left a
threatening message on the machine of a
black student there.

Second, there is a presumption that white
males will treat women and minorities differ-
ently. In my 30 years, I have had the opportu-
nity to attend W&L for seven years, a high
school with a significantly black student body
for three years and work for a federal agency
for over four years, and one thing has become

Student scolds

 
   

painfully clear to me: Decent people judge
others not on their color or gender, but on
their honesty, diligence, sense of humor,
coolness under fire, intelligence and ability to
stand on their own two feet. To send any
other message to students is antithetical to the
-educational mission of this school.

Indeed, one of our missions ought to be to
teach people to stand up for themselves. I am
reminded of Nat Hentoff’s story about a black
student at an Ivy League law school who
stood up and told one of the white students
arguing for a speech code that the white
student’s patronizing attitude toward him was
more harmful than the word ‘‘nigger.’’

Third, university disciplinary committees

_Should be looking at conduct and not speech,
‘per se. For example, if a person continues to
maké ‘‘ugly’’ jokes about someone who has
asked him to stop, the'SCC should examine
the conduct of harassment as opposed to the
content of the speech.

The very existence of the CRC implies
that we will sanction speech even if no pat-
tern of offensive conduct is present. The
chilling effect that this will have on speech
could be astonishing. Consider the likelihood
of being able to discuss fully the range of
opinions on welfare or abortion without
offending someone on racial or gender
grounds. Moreover, consider how easy it is to
offend someone inadvertently. Should some-
one be subject to discipline for a comment
laden with ‘‘subtle’’ racism or sexism?

One of the strongest arguments of those in
favor of co-education here was that it would
enhance the intellectual life of this campus
because of the woman’s viewpoint being
added. Wouldn’t it be interesting if the CRC,
a body designed to facilitate co-education,
silenced debate where the divergent views of
men and women could come to the surface?

The CRC should be relieved of its juris-
diction over speech issues. If students are
seeking such paternalism, they need only
apply to Ann Arbor.

slavery should be re-instituted. The Headbanger’s Ball is*
Out since it takes advantage of rebellious leather-wearing,
rebels by making fun of them. Sherman’s March to the Sea
takes a hike because it obviously condones raping, pillaging’
and arson. Ask any Georgian. Why, we’ll have to cancel,
Chi Omega’s White Camation Ball because it singles out

because it connotes an idea of fancy, i.e. rich, costumes or
outfits. Why not ‘‘Poor Dress’’ or ‘“The Unemployed’
Ball?’’ Anybody getting hot yet? Flames too high? Tough,
I’m not finished.

Now we turn to the fraternities. Alpha Phi Alpha wil
have to leave because it is a nationally black fraternity,
White males might feel intimidated. Kappa Alpha kicks the
bucket because of the reverse. The Fiji house will sign out;
too, because certain people might think Northerners are all
loud-mouthed Italians, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon is history

- because others might think they’re all drunk rednecks. °

Heck, we might just have to change the name of the
school. Both Washington and Lee owned slaves, a concept
that insults all intelligent people. So, let’s just rename out
‘university, because those people offend me for buying
people like mules. Doesn’t Wilson College has a nice ring.

I have to stop because this little fire I have started has
grown out of bounds and is consuming things beyond i
initial scope. Things like the Bill of Rights and the Consti-
tution, which the CRC didn’t intend to destroy. But theif
proposal, taken to logical extremes (and Americans have 4
knack for taking things to extremes), threatens to char and
incinerate those very documents. '

I have the right to say what I want, within certain laws
on obscenity. With that right comes the responsibility for
my words. If I call somebody ‘‘nigger,’’ a word I abhor, I
accept anger and any resulting action due to my saying that
word. I do not want a group such as the CRC judgin
whether or not I can graduate with my class after fighting
for a place at this special university because I call a girl a
“‘bitch.’’ I would hope we are all mature enough to realize
that such talk is absurd and that we will handle such
discourtesy ourselves without a watchdog enforcing polite
manners, True, good manners comes from within, not from
a law etched in stone. That is following orders, and I’m not
enlisted in any army. I would hope we are all strong
enough to speak our minds, whether or not somebod
agrees with us, and socially punish classmates who oan
outside the bounds of common courtesy and decency. »

But, alas, the politically correct have made inroads
even here. Line up outside Washington Hall, ladies and
gentlemen (excuse me, I mean, ‘‘persons with differing
sexual organs’’). Baby pacifiers will be distributed on the
left, and please drop off your constitutional rights in the
box on the left. Welcome to Generic Institute of Learning,
where your future rides on the shoulders of the meek and
inoffensive. By the way, no smoking — I hate cigarettes.’

Phi reporter, story

To the Editor:

I am writing to express my disgust and
offense at the recent Phi article, ‘‘Hudnall
cleared of rape and sodomy charges’’ (March
12). 1am embarrassed that such tabloid journal-
ism should be associated with the university and
supported by our student activities fee. Ms.
Lopiccolo must know that a sensitive issue like
rape needs to be handled with tact — not with
names needlessly dragged through the mud. I
only hope this article does not reflect a new,
lurid trend for The Ring-tum Phi. Will the
letterhead soon read The WAL Inquirer?

Sincerely,

Phirape coverage
is not sensational

To the Editor:

{ would like to address the dissatisfaction
concerning the Phi’s recent article about the
Hudnall case. There are many people who
believe that the article should not have been
printed. They believe the issue is too sensitive
and has been sensationalized in the Phi. But I
think the Phi should be commended. Cathy
Lopiccolo wrote an accurate, professional jour-
nalistic account of the event. Our student paper
is about reporting real, relevant news, and rape
on the W&L campus is all too real and relevant.
All major media sources report on rape cases,
and the Phi never disclosed the victim’s name.

Rape is a subject that has been too often
ignored in the past. I know people on this
campus who have endured this trauma — noth-
ing was said or done. The situation has never
received adequate attention.

The student who came forward has done a
great thing for the women of Washington and
Lee. She has shown great courage in confront-
ing Hudnall in court. The Phi has also done a
service to all W&L women by printing the
story. We can only put an end to rape by stay-
ing aware and talking about it.

The Phi is not some school project meant to
entertain the students of W&L, it is a media
device meant to keep this community informed,
run by real, aspiring journalists.

Sincerely,
Kelli Klick, ’93

EC warns thieves:
stealing is an HV

To the Student Body:

All of us enjoy the opportunity to purchase
food everyday at our Co-op. We have a unique
privilege to be able to place an order and then
pay for it while we wait. We are trusted by the
cashiers to tell them what we ordered, even
down to lettuce and tomatoes. They require no
proof of what we order, simply our word of

some students may be abusing this privilege.
The management feels that some students may
be taking food that they do not pay for. This
would obviously be stealing and a violation of
trust in the university community. This letter
serves as a warning that the Co-op will turn in
students to the EC who do not pay for their
food.

Thank you,

fellow Canadians could no longer bear your
insufferable bellyaching and encouraged you to
spread the misery around. You, the disaffected
rich boy, have done just that. Instead of spread-
ing prosperity and goodwill, you spread pessi-
mism and bitterness. You are the quintessential
tapeworm in the stomach that is the American
system.

Despite your prolific writings on the subject,
you appear to need a lesson in democracy.
While you have exercised your right to free
speech (often), you have not exercised your
brain in the bargain. We all know that democra-
cy can permit unfortunate results for a few
individuals; yet Americans do not stampede to
abolish our system wholesale. And citizens of
undemocratic countries, when given the choice,
invariably choose democracy. Witness: Nicara-
gua, Estonia, Czechoslovakia, Russia, Poland,
Chile, Hungary, Turkey... And the essence of
democracy: the right to vote.

We are hardly surprised at your cynicism in
rejecting the power of the ballot box. You,
young Mr. MacKenzie, have been given every-
thing and have sacrificed nothing. By your
ungrateful behavior, you have demonstrated to
all of us that you do not deserve freedom as
much as those less fortunate persons in other
lands, who risk life and limb for the chance to
taste liberty.

Since you are so well-travelled, maybe you
ought to take your show on the road once again:
we hear the communist Chinese are looking for
a few volunteers for their PR department. You
ought to fit right in. And until that blessed day,
remember that you are not part of the solution,
you are part of the problem.

Criticism avoids
finding a solution

To the Editor: {

Heaven knows I wouldn’t want to add to the
growing ego of Mr. MacKenzie, but I felt it
necessary to truly set the record straight and
save us all from his continuing barrage of
truisms.

It is apparent from his letter to the Phi on
March 12 that Mr. MacKenzie has no personal
affection for the United States and her system of
government. Fine. It’s probably fair to say that
everyone has, at some point, criticized our
government. It is one of the rights given us by
the Constitution. However, I fail to see the
utility of tearing down the entire infrastructure
of our society without offering a single tenable
solution to its problems. Yes, our system is
flawed, but has Mr. MacKenzie provided us
with any answers to the faults he has so easily
found? Has the ever-so-worldly Mr. MacKenzie
encountered a system so far superior to ours that
we should scrap 216 years of work? I doubt it.

It seems unlikely that we’ve heard the last of
Mr. MacKenzie, but I would just like to say that

if all he has to offer are a lot of unsubstantiated

Principle destroys
what it ‘protects’

To the Editor:

The Confidential Review Committee’s new
conduct creed considers it Washington and
Lee’s privilege to deny us our First Amendment
rights because W&L is a private institution.
Does this mean that all of our Constitutional
rights will be denied by the university? What’s
next? Will women not be allowed to vote? Will
students be denied habeas corpus? Will we be
denied the freedom to practice our own religion?

According to Amendment X of the Constitu-
tion, ‘‘the powers not delegated to the United
States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it,
to the states, are reserved to the states respec-
tively, or to the people.’’ As a student-run
government, doesn’t that mean that we, as the
students, have the right to determine whether or
not the administration can censor our opinions
and publications?

By denying our Constitutional rights, the
CRC is undermining its own position, since it is
the Constitution that gives us that equal oppor-
tunity. By denying us our Constitutional rights,
the CRC is rejecting one of the fundamental
ideas they are trying to uphold.

Sincerely,
Heather Leonard, ’94

Class of 92 urged
to give annually

To the Class of 1992:

As the Young Alumni Vice Chairman of the
Washington and Lee Annual Fund, I am respon-
sible for encouraging greater participation in the
Annual Fund among young alumni.

For those who are not familiar with the
Annual Fund, it is the primary means of solicit-
ing alumni contributions to the university.
Unlike contributions to the university’s endow-

ment, contributions to the Annual Fund are used .,
to, buy, library, books,, pay faculty, salaries,and ,

otherwise finance. the same costs, covered by.
tuition. In fact, a strong Annual Fund is what
allows W&L to maintain tuition at a relatively
low level, especially in comparison to other
selective schools across the country.

Although W&L alumni take great pride in
the university, W&L continually ranks well
below most schools with which we compete in
terms of the percentage of alumni contributing
to the Annual Fund. Because improving Alumni
participation is a continuing priority, we are
making a special effort to encourage alumni
who have graduated since 1981 to contribute to
the Annual Fund.

Part of this effort is to emphasize to current
W&L students the importance of the Annual
Fund, continuing a tradition with the Class of
1992, who will soon be the youngest of the
university’s alumni. In the next several weeks,
members of the class will be contacted by a
classmate about participating in the 1992-93
Annual Fund through the Senior Class Pledge
Project. I hope that students, when contacted

  

about the Annual Fund, will make a pledge and
participate fully in the success of the university.

Sincerely,
Bennett Ross, ’83

Live Drive thanks
MC volunteers

To the W&L Community,

I want to recognize the people who volun-
teered their time to Live Drive for Mock
Convention weekend, and I wish to share last
weekend’s statistics with the community.

Thanks to Amy Roberson, Jess Graff,
Melissa McNaull, Dionne Blyden, Sara Morgan,
B.J. League, R.H. Powell, Alan Hamrick, Chris
Barlow, Whitney Bludworth, Doug Burns, Ros-
anne Cornbrooks and Bill Gregg for Live Dri-
ve’s 45 man-hours logged last weekend. Special
thanks to everyone who worked until 2:30 and
3 a.m. until Zollman’s was cleared. Live Drive
carried about 575 people MC weekend.

To all those callers who found another route
before we got to you, we can only say, we did
our best. Thank you for your courtesy and
understanding.

Finally, we appreciate the many thank you’s
we get when picking people up. But the best
way you can show your gratitude is to get
involved. If each person who used Live Drive
this weekend signed up to work just once, it
would keep us rolling the year round. So we
hope to see many of you in the driver’s seat in
the future.

On Behalf of Live Drive,
Rick Peltz, 93

Freshmen pay tax
and get nothing

To the Editor:

I am writing in response to an incident that I
witnessed on Monday, March 16. About 1:45
p.m. I saw a sight we are all too familiar with -
a W&L security guard towing a car. What made
this unusual was where the car was parked —
not on W&L property, but on the street in front
of Sigma Chi. When I asked why, I was told
that freshmen weren’t allowed to park anywhere
except the freshmen lot. I was amazed to leam
this, especially since they are subject to the
same car tax that we are.

So basically, they have to pay the tax and
then are not allowed by W&L, not Lexington, to
even use the streets that they pay for. What

_gives W&L security the right to decide where

anyone can park as long as it’s not on campus?
In the fall of 1988, there were around 1,100
spaces for 1,200 stickers. Of course, that was
before both Gaines and Lenfest took over prime
parking areas. Don’t get me wrong, I love not
being able to find a space in the Corral at 8:45
on a Tuesday morning or, for that matter, any
evening. It seems that the majority of cars in the
corral are permanently parked there, leaving no
room for anyone else. Maybe W&L should
spend more time and money trying to come up
with more parking spaces and less on supplying
the city with a new fire-fighting truck.

Sincerely,
Lee A. Rorrer, ’93

Senior

 

I’m not really sure why the Phi asked me to write a
perspective on Fancy Dress. If the editors had followed
me around on any of my past three FD’s, I’m pretty sure
they would have asked someone else. I have an uncanny
ability to ask the wrong person, and the choice of date is
theoretically one of the keys to having a successful
weekend.

I say theoretically because that’s the beauty of FD.
You can take the female equivalent of the Antichrist and
still have a good time. I know, I’ve done it. Yet even
taking into account my track record of female compan-
ions, the three FD’s I’ve attended still rank up there as
three of the best weekends I’ve had at W&L.

Now, I’m not going to go off and tell a bunch of
obscure stories about FD that involve people only myself
and my friends know. I'll let the junior and sophomore
perspectives do that, and everyone except for the freshmen
can skip over them like always. What I thought was best
to do was to formulate my own warped version of a FD
guideline. The following criteria are only suggestions,
ignore them at your benefit or peril.

1. Take someone fun. FD is expensive, and you
don’t want to waste your money on someone who’s going
to sit there and watch while you have a great time. A
corollary to this rule is that high school girlfriends or
boyfriends who are still in high school are usually a bad
choice. They’re not in college yet, and they have no idea
what you've been doing for the past seven months. Keep
it that way. They'll find out soon enough when they get
to college.

2. Plan to spend a lot more money than you antici-

pate. I guarantee you’ll spend it. Take your most liberal
estimate on what you think you'll need and add at least
$50, depending on your spending habits.

3. Learn at least one ballroom dance. This sounds
stupid, but dancing to the orchestra or swing band is a
blast.

4. When you first get to the ball, walk around and
look at the decorations. You won’t recognize the gym,
and the FD committees do a great job decorating. This is
not a prom with cheap crepe paper and cardboard stars.

5. The week of FD, get your work done early. You
won't get any work done during the weekend.

6. Buy good beer for the weekend. Don’t let your
date think you’re cheap unless he or she already knows it.

7. Don’t take your FD cups to any of the weekend
parties if you plan on keeping them.

8. If you lose your date, don’t spend all weekend
chasing after him or her. If you get ditched, find someone
else who has been ditched. There will be plenty. For some
reason, FD is conducive to date-swapping, and it makes
for great stories you can tell all of your friends on Sun-
day.

9. Don’t tell your date, ‘Well, I was going to take
him or her, but he or she already had a date.”’ This is
common sense, but you’d be surprised at the number of
times it happens. If you do make this mistake, refer to
guideline #8 for help in coping with the aftermath.

10. Have fun, and don’t stress out about finals
coming up. You can take a class over again, but you only
have four FD’s.

Well, there it is. I’m sure some others will come to
mind, but that should give you a pretty good idea. Num-
ber 10 is the most important; FD is a great tradition and
a lot of fun, so just relax and enjoy the ride.

By JENNY MITCHELL
Sophomore

 

Fancy Dress, the biggest and best party at
WAL, brings to campus a spirit of exuberance and
fun that we look forward to experiencing all year.

Girls start worrying and wondering who their
FD dates are going to be months in advance. After
Christmas break, the ‘‘FD date’’ becomes #1 on
the agenda. FD’s imminent arrival is marked by a
noticeable increase in the number of party par-
ticipants between the months of January and
March. Even the academicians of W&L who never
set foot outside the library, except to make a
disciplined two-and-a-quarter-minute trek to the co-
op and back, break “‘tradition’’ and go to parties in
their effort to get a date.

As further evidence of FD’s importance, most
guys actually ask their chosen girl a week and a
half or more in advance of the great occasion.
These facts alone make FD an extremely signifi-
cant event. Why is it so significant?

It is three days chock full of fun. You get to
eat at a nice restaurant (if you’re lucky), dance to

good music without bumping into people (because
there is enough room, unlike at most fraternity
parties), look like you spent more than ten minutes
getting dressed and party as hard as you like.
Another great part of FD is watching what every-
body else is doing.

Basically, you see a bunch of people maneu-
vering around the dance floor and either acting like
Or not even pretending to know what they’re doing.

Once in awhile there will be a couple looking
dreamily into one another’s eyes moving in an ever
slower circle over the same spot.

Then, of course, you run into the Hollywood
wannabes who collide into, run over and trample
people in a frenzied attempt to catch the photog-
raphers.

It must be noted, however, that at least half
the people have no clue that they have been
knocked into because they are so faint from their
recent decision to put themselves on a liquid diet.

Another interesting phenomenon you will
observe is the single female or male furtively dart-
ing from one part of the gym to the other talking to
different people and sort of blending in with the

Fancy Dress? I have no idea what is in
store for me, but the stories I have heard from
past years leave me with great expectations.

Actually, the majority of the people who
shared their experiences with me commented on
how many people got Minor-in-Possession tick-
ets or were picked up for public intoxication. At
least I’ll know what to avoid! I was advised to
look at the decorations before the dance because
they are so magnificent, but supposedly no one

The FD from Hell

 

By EMILY GREER
Senior

I guess I’ve had my share of
Fancy Dress nightmares. I have been,
since freshman year, one of the first
to say, ‘‘FD is overrated,’’ but last
year I had such a good time with one
of my best friends, that my whole
idea of messy FD’s was confounded,
and I can no longer claim to have a
perfect running score of FD disasters.

Freshman year, I panicked and
invited an ex-boyfriend from Georgia
Tech, who proceeded to do water-
bongs all weekend in my dorm room,
and was so far gone at the ball, in the
tux / rented, after eating the Dom-
ino’s pizza(s?) / paid for, with the FD
tickets I also paid for, that he was
unable to appreciate the extensive
decorations in the Warner Center. |
owe much to my dorm counselor for
her subtle response to the odd smell
permeating our hall. She could have
made my life rather difficult post-weekend.

By MEREDITH GRONROOS
Junior

 

     

   

There is nothing else like Fancy
Dress, ‘‘THE collegiate event of the
South,” a phrase that I read in the
Phi my freshman year and that has
stayed with me ever since.

The best party of the year, at a
school which excels at both education
and recreation, is obviously a function
of epic proportions. An entire week-
end of new clothes, or nonstop drink-
ing, depending on your priorities.
Junior women, only for whom can I
speak, are armed with the experiences
of prior years and are ready for the
weekend, and most importantly, the
ball.

There are certain precautions to
take and preparations to make that
will ensure a pleasurable FD experi-
ence for all concerned. First and fore-
most — and I cannot stress this
enough — do not, and I'll repeat it,
do not let anyone persuade you to try
a new and unusual cocktail or mixed
drink in honor of FD. This is the
worst thing you can do. Stay with
what you know, because I guarantee
you, in the excitement of the occa-
sion, you will not even notice how
much you are ‘“‘trying.’’ And before
you know it, FD will be just a memo-
ry for you — and your date, by whom
you will henceforth be remembered
as “‘you know, the one I took to FD.

WHY YOU SHOULD START PLANNING FOR

 

 

‘RETIREMENT WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED.

or retirement to be the time of your life, you
have to dream a little—about the things
you've always wanted to do: travel, explore,

+ ‘start a business. Just imagine...

With a dream and a plan, you can make it
happen. Your pension and Social Security
should provide a good
basic retirement income,
but what about all those
extras that make your
dreams possible? You'll
probably need some
additional savings.

THE DREAM IS YOUR OWN.
WE CAN HELP YOU WITH THE PLAN.

it is: the biggest and best dressed
party you’ve ever been to.

Speaking of best dressed, there
are a few things to think of when
purchasing and planning the FD en-
semble besides, ‘‘When he sees me in
this. dress, he’s gonna wish he never
laid eyes on that sorry hag by his
side,”’

Having fun will high on your list
of priorities. First, | will not buy a
dress which restricts my movement in
any way. If I cannot simultaneously
hold my drink out to the side, shag
and/or jitterbug, make my way
through crowds, pose for pictures and
support my stumbling date in this
dress, then I am hating it.

I will not wear shoes that look
good, but that don’t have traction on
the floor covered in spilled drinks, or
won’t let me walk many miles from
the pre-party to the gym. (It always
seems like miles, even if it’s right
down the street.)

I will not burden myself with a
high-maintenance hairdo. Having to
fight my way into the bathroom every
ten minutes through the hordes of
other insecure and unsteady women
will cut down on my dance-floor
time. (And I wouldn’t want to deprive
all my fans of that graceful sight.)

I won’t wear long, dangly or
heavy jewelry that requires constant
readjustment because that’s just a
pain in the butt, and I only have two
hands after all.

Most men don’t notice that FD
provides other amusements besides
the bands and the decorations. The-
re’s the perennial favorite, ‘‘Would
You Look What She’s Wearing!’’

This game can be played for hours at
a time, with one or ten of your clos-
est girlfriends, some of whom you
may have just met in the bathroom.

The object of this game is to find
fellow party-goers who fit into one or
more of the following categories:
“‘What A Gorgeous Dress!;’’ ‘‘That
Dress Has S-E-M Written All Over
ltl; ==My Last Year &
FD/Christmas/New Year’s Dress
Looks Just Like That Except...;’’
‘“‘BIG HAIR! BIG HAIR!;”’ ‘‘Who Is
She With?;’’ and my personal favor-
ite, “Those Shoes Do not Go With
That Dress.’’

This is a good game to play if
you did not suit up for this ‘‘athletic”’
event as carefully as I suggested, and
find that your feet are hurting you
big-time. One warning however: dates
who do not bring to people-watching
the same vigor that you do can get a
little ornery if you seem to be enjoy-
ing the game more than their compa-
ny.

However, before I even arrive this
year, there are a couple of things
which I am determined to do. I am
going to go to those Arthur Murray
dance lessons offered way-cheap right
before FD if it kills me.

Also, before I graduate I am
going to attend FD in costume, be-
cause that is the only way to adhere
to the true spirit of the ball, and the
only sure way to have the eyes of
everyone in the gym upon you.
Which really is the goal after all, no
matter which category you fit into,
right?

So in the immortal words of
Wayne and Garth, Party on.

Changes won't expand CRC's jurisdiction

 

By GREG PATTERSON
Phi Staff Reporter

 

The Confidential Review Committee’s 46-page pro-
posal to restructure itself would not change the CRC’s jurisdic-
tion, said CRC Chairman Joan Shaughnessy.

If the present proposal is accepted, Shaughnessy said,
the revised CRC would maintain its current jurisdiction over
verbal harassment and sexual harassment and assault. She said
the CRC would not enforce the proposed “Principle of Civility
and Decency” beyond those categories.

Shaughnessy said the only substantial changes would
be that the CRC would have a student majority and that student
representatives would be appointed by the Executive Com-
mittee, instead of by the university president.

Another major change is that if both the accused and
accuser in a case consent, the case may be heard in front of the
SCC instead of the CRC.

“The CRC hopes that with time the SCC will be able to

take over all these areas completely,” Shaughnessy said. “But
the majority of the committee feels that time has not yet arrived.

The proposal is being reviewed by the Student Affairs
Committee, which will make a recommendation to the faculty.
The faculty will vote on SAC’s recommendation in May. The
revisions do not have to be approved by the student body.

An overwhelming majority of students who were asked
for their opinions on the proposal said they did not know enough
about it to make a decision.

“I can’t comment on something I haven’t seen,” junior
Jennifer Gibson said. Gibson said she thinks the proposal should
be available to students.

EC Secretary Caroline Wight said she tried to help a
student find a copy of the report, but couldn’t.

“It hasn’t been really publicized. It would be hard for
people to know about it,” Wight said. “If students want to read
{the report] they really have to search for it.”

Dean of Students and SAC Chairman David Howison
said copies of the report are on reserve at the library for students.

Many decry Columbus' treatment of native groups

 

v COLUMBUS continued from page 1

 

logs, one in which he underreported the dis-
tance the ships made each day so as not to alarm
the sailors and to keep the real route a secret.

Writer Hans Koning accuses Colum-
bus of the genocide of the New World Indians
and their environment, saying Columbus cre-
ated a cruel slave trade of Indians between
Spain and the island of Hispaniola. In Colum-
bus: His Enterprise, Koning cites instances in
which Indians had their hands chopped off if
they failed to meet the gold dust quota. The
Spaniards had so totally pacified the Indians,
he said, that one could take any Indian woman
and do with her as he pleased.

Gates contends, “It’s safe to say he
never saw it that way,” citing Columbus role as
a crusader as well as a seeker of honor and
wealth.

Regardless, Columbus became and
embarrassment to the crown as detailas of the
Spaniard atrocities reached Spain, according

to writer David Gelman.

“Under his stewardship, the first per-
manent Spanish settlement in the New World
became so cruel and chaotic that he was re-
turned to Europe in chains,” Gates elaborated.

Although King Ferdinand pardoned
Columbus more than 500 years ago, some dis-
pute the legitimacy of his actions more vehe-
mently than ever. Koning and many others
plead for a less “Eurocentric” world history
than what is currently taught in classrooms.

Some fear that the controversy cur-
rently surrounding the passing quincentennial
and a demand for retribution by those whose
ancestors may have been wronged by the Span-
iards will create a backlash in our historical
perceptions.

“So now, in reaction to it, comes the
manufacture of its opposite myth,” Time writer
Robert Hughes said. “European man, once the
hero of the conquest of Americas, now be-
comes its demon; and the victims, who cannot
be brought back to life, are sanctified.”

Molloy pitches Generals to split

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE
Phi Staff Reponer

 

It was a Jekyll and Hyde week
for the Washington and Lee baseball
team.

On Saturday, the Generals split
a double-header with Randolph-
Macon. They lost the opener 14-5,
and then rebounded in the finale, 3-1.
The team then took on the Bridge-
water Eagles Monday and were
soundly defeated 13-5.

Head Coach Jeff Stickley said
he wasn’t disappointed with the up-
and-down play.

‘We're not down or disap-
pointed with the losses. We were
close in the first game against Rand-
olph-Macon and we played very well
in the second,” said Stickley.

In the first game, the Generals
fell behind 6-0 after three innings.
The Generals scored five runs in the
fifth to close the gap to one.

115 S. Main St., Lexington

However, R-MC exploded in the
seventh for eight runs and won 14-5,

In the night-cap, sophomore
Tim Molloy pitched a seven-hit, one
run game, and powered the Generals
to a 3-1 win.

Molloy limited the Yellow
Jackets to all singles, while striking
out six. It was the best pitching per-
formance by a Generals pitcher this
year.

‘I pitched really well from start
to finish,’’ said Molloy. ‘‘Plus, the
defense played great and that made it
much easier.’’

Senior T.J. Daly homered in the
second to open the scoring. Junior
John Hesse had the game-winner with
an RBI single in the fourth. Freshman
Duane Van Arsdale closed out the
scoring with a round-tripper in the
sixth,

Van Arsdale’s homer was his
fourth this year, the most by a Gener-
al since 1989. He upped his slugging

percentage to .913. Daly’s 5-for-6
performance raised his average to
.400 on the season.

’ The Generals’ roller coaster
week closed with a 13-5 loss to the
Eagles. Again, the Generals fell
behind early and couldn’t catch up.

BC pounded out seven runs on
seven hits in the first two innings and
never looked back. They added six
more runs in the later innings and
won comfortably. The loss highlight-
ed the Generals’ biggest concern thus
far.

“‘Our biggest problem is getting
out of the first inning without being
behind,”’ said Stickley. ‘‘It’s a totally
different ball game when we're
behind. We can’t be aggressive and
play our game.”’

“However, by playing these
good teams our young pitchers are
learning to pitch. I think they’ll come
around soon and pitch steady from
the first inning on,”’ he said.

Golfers start season strong; rally
to finish seventh in S.C. Classic

 

By JAY PLOTKIN
Phi Sports Editor

 

The Washington and Lee golf
team took to the links for the first
time this season and picked up right
where they left off last year.

At the Gordin Collegiate Clas-
sic, W&L rallied on the final day of
competition to finish seventh.

‘I’m happy with the finish,”’
said Coach Buck Leslie. ‘‘We were
ninth after two days and thought we
could pick up three or four spots. We
managed to pick up two, and I felt
better after that.’’

W&L was led by senior all-
american Jay McKnight. McKnight
shot a three-round total of 239.

Senior Cliff Burrow had a
strong weekend as well, finishing
second for W&L.

pressure he was under, and he didn’t
play that much last year,”’ said Leslie.
‘*He hasn’t had that much experience.
He played well to say the least.”

Leslie feels that despite the
strong showing, W&L still has some
work to do to defend their Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference title and
retum to nationals for the third
straight year. :

“The ODAC is going to be
tough,’” he said. ‘‘We’ve definitely
got our work cut out for us. Guiford
is a tough team, and everyone in the
ODAC is improved. Greensboro is
also tough in our region if we have
tournament hopes.”’

Leslie says the team has simple
goals, and if they stick to the basics,
everything should fall into place.
“We can’t think nationals first,”’
Leslie said. ‘‘That will get you in
trouble. You can never forget what’s
immediately in front of you.”’

Wa&L lacrosse teams reach crucial stretch

Streaking Generals look to
overcome Roanoke’s mystique

 

By JACOB KIMBALL
Phi Staff Reporter

 

“It’s exciting, Everybody likes
to win, and we are having fun win-
ning.”’

Coach Jan Hathorn said that is
how Washington and Lee’s women’s
lacrosse team is feeling as they con-
tinue the best start in school history.
Randolph-Macon was the latest vic-
tim. W&L won 13-3 Saturday to raise
its record to 4-0.

Angie Carrington led the fun
this time. She scored four goals and
handed out two assists. Lisa Dowling
netted three goals and added two
assists, Kim Bishop scored two goals
and dished out four assists and
Whitney Hopkins finished with two
goals and an assist.

Jennifer Donaldson anchored a
tenacious defense. She had six saves.

‘They are strong skill wise,
they show good spirit, and they work
really hard,’’ Hathorn said.

The hard work has paid off
early for three freshmen who start.
Carrie Niederer has played a key role
for the stingy defense, while Nicole
Ripken and Lindsay Coleman have
been a force offensively.

‘All the freshmen show great
potential, and I look forward to us
improving as a group over the next
four years,’ said Coleman, who starts
and scored two goals on Saturday.

The next test for the Generals’
spotless record is defending Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference champion
Roanoke, which has also opened the
season undefeated at 2-0.

“There is a lot of emotion
surrounding this game,’’ Hathorn
said. ‘‘There is a certain mystique

For the Washington and Lee track teams, the first
outdoor meet of the season brought home high marks
from the respective coaches.

The women’s team defeated both Eastern
Mennonite and Bridgewater, and the men’s team came
in second to Bridgewater while beating Eastern
Mennonite.

‘I thought we had a chance to win the meet,”’
said men’s coach Norris Aldridge, ‘‘but I’m pleased
with the way we performed.”

‘The meet was what I expected,’’ said women’s
coach John Tucker. ‘‘I saw competitiveness and good
performances. I was real pleased.”’

The best performance of the day came from
freshman Kim Herring in the 4-by-400 relay team.

‘She ran the third leg, and by the time she got
the baton, we trailed by 30 to 40 yards,’’ Tucker said.
‘‘Not only did she make up all the ground, she opened

 

Herring stars in first outdoor meet

up a 20 yard lead, and we were able to hold on to win
the race.”’

Herring also won the 400-meter, the 1500-meter
and the 5,000-meter runs.

‘*What it all boiled down to,’’ said Tucker, ‘
that Kim Herring put on a show.”’

Freshman Sarah Gilbert also was a triple winner
for the Generals. She won the high jump, the triple
jump and the long jump.

Herring’s performance overshadowed sophomore
Wendy Neel’s run in the 100-meter dash. She set a
school-record of 13.1 seconds despite finishing second.

On the men’s side, sophomore Robert Miggins
walked off the basketball court and won the high jump
with a leap of 6-feet-4.

‘*Miggins has a lot of ability to be a good high
jumper,”’ Aldridge said. ‘‘He needs to get the form
down.”’

Junior Bo Hannah won twice, winning the 1500-
and 5000-meter runs. Jim Henry, David Martin and
Scott Covey also won events for W&L.

Men’s comeback attempt falls
just short against Roanoke

The W&L men’s lacrosse team
had one of those games Saturday.

The Generals played about as
well as they could play against Roa-
noke College, but that wasn’t quite
good enough.

“‘We played one hell of a
game,”’ said coach Jim Stagnitta after
Roanoke topped W&L 14-11. ‘‘They
are definitely one of the best three or
four teams in the nation.”’

WA&L trailed 10-6 in the fourth
quarter before mounting a furious
rally.

John Hunter, Wiemi Douoguih,
Colin Higgins and Jeff Roberts scored
to cut the lead to 11-10 with three
minutes left, but Roanoke scored
twice to kill the W&L’s rally.

““The bottom line was they were
deeper and more athletic, and we still
could have won the game,”’ said

At the beginning of the season,
the ultimate goal for the Washington
and Lee men’s tennis team was to
make the Division III national tourna-
ment.

This past week the Generals got a
taste of what tournament competition
will be like.

After jumping out to a 4-0 record,
the Generals went 1-3 this week and
dropped to 5-3 on the season, 4-0 in
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference. The three losses were at the
hands of Division I schools James
Madison and Davidson, and Emory,

FLORIST

the ranked 6th-ranked team in Div-
ision III.

“‘We played well against all
three,’’ said senior Richard Yates.
“*However, we just couldn’t come up
with the big points to win.”’

Thursday the Generals entertained
JMU and came out on the short end
of a 6-3 score. It was the first loss for
the Generals and their first against a
Division I opponent.

W&L didn’t get any reprieve as
they went on a weekend road trip to
Emory and Davidson. The Generals
lost the opener on Saturday to Emory,
7-2. Wes Ruggles got one of the
points by upsetting 24th-ranked Col-
lin White at fourth singles 6-4, 6-4.

Stagnitta. ‘‘If we had shot well, we
would have won the game.”’

W&L got three goals from
Roberts, Higgins and Douoguih,
Roberts also had three assists. Senior
Coleman Devlin made 19 saves in
goal for the Generals.

One thing Stagnitta was ex-
tremely proud of was the fan support.

‘*That was the biggest thing for
us,’’ he said. ‘‘To get that kind of
support on the road meansa lot to the
kids.”’

Wednesday, the Generals routed
Virginia Wesleyan 19-3. Roberts had
three goals and three assists to lead a
balanced attack. David Schimingey
and Andy Dutton each scored three
goals.

““We were happy with our play
against Emory,”’ said assistant coach
Gavin Colliton. ‘‘We just couldn’t
win the big points, and that’s the key.
factor in any match.”’

The Generals got a break Tuesday:
as they made a short trip over the
mountain to Lynchburg. They took
out their frustrations, blanking the:
Hornets 9-0.

The Generals will be challenged
again Saturday when nationally-ran-
ked Wooster pays a visit. Colliton,
says this is going to be a key test for’
the Generals. ‘

““We want to prove how good we
are, and if we want to make the tour-
nament we need to beat them.”’

The moment of discovery is

‘announcement of 85th annual Fancy
Dress Ball theme: ‘‘A Return Voy-
age to the Age of Exploration.”’
‘This year’s theme reflects a
world-wide celebration of the dawn-

‘technology and culture, which his-

By the time the expected 2500
guests enter the Warner Center
March 27th, more than 200 people
will have contributed to FD’s organi-
zation. Almost $80,000 and hundreds
of man-hours will have been expend-
ed to retrace the journeys of the
most famous mariner of the millenni-
um, Christopher Columbus.

The travels of Columbus provid-
ed the link that joined forever two
worlds previously separated both

The age of Everyman
‘Columbus was just one slice of life in 1492

 

By JENNIFER ZAMBONE
Special to the Phi

 

Columbus’ voyage wasn’t all
‘that happened in 1492.
t ¢ Lorenzo de Medici died at age
43 in his city of Florence. His grand-
‘son, the prince of Machiavelli’s The
,Prince, was bor later in the year.
Niccold Machiavelli himself was 23.
¢ Leonardo da Vinci was living
in Milan, engaged mostly in writing
on scientific topics, unaware that in
‘three years he would be asked to
paint a fresco in a nearby convent on
a suitably religious subject.

¢ Ferdinand and Isabella of
Spain had better things to do than
worry about a Genoese sailor. Per-
‘suaded by the Inquisition leader, they
.expelled all Jews from Spain. Their
determined campaign to expel the
‘Moors from Spain triumphed when

they captured Granada.

¢ Charles VIII of France paid
the price of peace with England’s
Henry VII and two years later started
war by invading Italy.

* English theater crowds were
being wowed by a new upbeat play,
Everyman. The literate were delving
into works more or less hot off the
press, including Le Morte D’ Arthur,
published just seven years before.

¢ Italy topped France in fashion,
as the Spanish chose Italian comfort
over French design.

* Genoese-turned-Englishman
John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto) was
looking for funds to finance a trans-
Atlantic expedition. Two years later
Caboto landed in Newfoundland,
which he determined to be the north-
ern coast of China.

Jennifer Zambone is editor of
the Journal of Science.

Columbus did not set out to
locate a ‘‘New World.”’ Instead, he
sought a quick route to China and
the Spice Islands which would yield
gold and treasures untold, as well as
ready converts to Christianity. Yet in
1492 he stumbled into the Caribbean
Islands of Cuba and Hispaniola
while in search of a route from
Spain to Asia by way of the Atlantic
Ocean

Washington and Lee’s celebra-
tion will reconstruct much of the fact

 

 

 

 

 

 

and ‘‘fancy’’ that has created the
legend of Christopher Columbus.

Perhaps Newsweek, in its own
special Columbus edition, expressed
the spirit with which W&L’s event
will be held:

“Only imagination can bring us
close to him: So put yourself in his
shoes.... at last your dream comes
true. They’ve given you your ships,
the winds are favorable, you reach
the land you always knew would be
there...

In 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue, but
historians agree on little else, as tall tales have
mixed fact with fancy over the last five centuries.

Genoese Cristoforo Colombo was probably
born in the fall of 1451 to Spanish-Jewish parents.
As a young man he took to the sea in commercial
ventures by age 14.

By age 30 Columbus was an accomplished sail-
or, and images of China’s splendor, the fame of
Marco Polo, Ptolemy’s exaggerated geographical
assertions, and the Scriptures soon spurred him to
sail westward. He deduced that China lay about
west, about a third the actual to the New World.

Rejected in Portugal, Columbus made an explo-
ration proposal to Spain in 1486, but a war against
the Moors persisted in draining royal coffers. When
the war ended in January, 1492, Columbus’ follow-
ing at court swayed Queen Isabella to his cause.

Educated people in 1492 already guessed the
earth to be round, so Columbus probably did not
need to convince the Spanish monarchs. Columbus
was given the rough equivalent to $14,000 for the
voyage, a relatively low budget operation.

In September, 1492, three ships, the Nifia,
Pinta and Santa Maria, the latter carrying Colum-
bus, weighed anchor from the Canary Islands.
Within one month, sailors on the Santa Maria,

 

 

Columbus, by the 16th-century artist Lotto

frustrated by repeated false sightings of land,
demanded that Columbus turn back.

Two days later, a lookout on the Pinta sighted
land by night, probably Watling Island in today’s
Bahamas. When day broke, he and a party went
ashore and planted the Spanish flag on the coast.

There is little doubt Columbus believed during

 

his first voyage that he was in the East. His writ-
ings make mention of sending a delegation to meet
China’s Great Khan.

On return to Spain, Columbus was showered
with attention and promised another voyage.

Columbus again traveled westward in 1493,
1498 and 1502. In the summer of 1498, Columbus
landed on the South American mainland. That
voyage seemed to give him his first indication that
he was in a new world.

“T believe that this is a very large mainland, of
which, until today, we have had no knowledge,”’
Columbus wrote, according to Lorenzo Camusso.

Columbus’ latter voyages did not give him as
much fame as the first. He carried the first mass of
colonists to the West with his second voyage,
bringing with them the plants, domesticated ani-
mals, food, and of course diseases of Europe that
would forever change the face of the West. But he
was not an exceptional governor, and fighting
among colonists and New World natives, and
general lawlessness were rampant problems. As the
result of one insurrection, he was returned to Spain
in chains, humiliated and frustrated.

With failing health in the first years of the 16th
century, Columbus negotiated with Spain’s King
Ferdinand for the explorer’s share of trade profits,
according to Camusso. In 1504, a rich but arthritic
and embittered Columbus died in Spain, not fully
cognizant of the scope of his accomplishments.

A Phi interview with FD Chairman Vallotton

Q: Why do you think this theme trans-
lates well for Fancy Dress?

A: This theme was chosen in order to
celebrate the centennial celebration
of Christopher Columbus’ discovery
of the New World. Because it has
never been done before, we thought
it was particularly appropriate to
choose it as this year’s theme.

Q: How much money is being spent?
Explain the budget...

A: The budget for this year’s ball is
$75,900, the majority of which is
spent on the bands and the decora-
tions. All of the money comes from
the memorabilia sales the week be-
fore the ball.

Q: What other themes were consid-
ered?

A: The other top choices were
Casablanca, Mardi Gras, Graceland,

Wild West, Dr. Suess and Alice in
Wonderland.

Q: What’s you most difficult duty?
A: My most difficult duty is trying to
please every- fF .
one. I have to
make ex-
tremely diffi-
cult decisions
sometimes and
people are not
always happy
with what 1 de- Us
cide. However, Vallotton
I think through my decisions very
carefully, and in the end, hopefully
everything will turn out all right.

Q: What are your responsibilities?
A: My responsibilities are to oversee
the whole process. I have to manage
200 people, make sure we keep under

   

budget on everything, follow through
on all the decoration orders, etc.

Q: What will be done differently this
year?

A: This year we hired a contractor to
construct most of the difficult deco-
rations. Also, as has been publicized,
cut the playbill, as well as the fire
works,

Q: Did you have any goals for FD?
A: I have had lots of goals this year
for Fancy Dress, such as maintaining
organization, keeping under budget
and managing my time wisely. My
most important goal, however, is to
have fun. If I have fun,then it is con-
veyed to everyone else on the com-
mittee. It has a sort of snowball ef-
fect, in that they also seen to enjoy
what they are doing, and the entire
process runs more smoothly.

 

   

 

FD Ball’s status
has traveled full
circle since 1907

Phi Associate Editor

night concert boasted a separate theme from the stodgy
Inauguration: ““Love-In 69.”

 

Washington and Lee’s first official Fancy Dress
Ball wasn’t as elaborate as some over the last 85 years,
which have featured camels, elephants, train cars, and
spotlights. In contrast to the thousands of dollars spent

on Fancy Dress today,
$42 left over from a the-
ater production proceeds
funded the first gala, held
in 1907.

Annie Jo Rob-
ertson White, the college
librarian and drama club
president, used the
money to decorate the
old gymnasium for a
masked ball. Admission
price for the ball was free,
although costumes cost
about $2. An orchestra
from VMI played all the
latest two-steps.

According to
thenext week's Ring-tum
Phi, “About 40 couples
and 50 stags partici-
pated.”

The 20s and 30s
marked the ball’s hey-
day, with thousands of
people in attendance. The
Ball was professionally
decorated and received
national attention. The
band made its national
debut when it was broad-
cast live via Walter
Winchell and the Lucky

Library file
Annie Jo White, the founder of Fancy Dress
Strike Radio Network hookup. Newspapers from New
York to Texarcana reported on it. The biggest jazz
bands and orchestras of the day, such as Count Basie,
Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman played at the Ball.
The 1969 bali boasted “psychedelic
music anda professional light show.” The Fancy Dress
Committee offered the languid theme of “‘An Inaugu-
ration Ball,” not in honor of a United States president, or
a mythical Egyptian tyrant, but rather for new Wash-
ington and Lee President Robert Huntley. The Saturday

  

VMI cadets wait in the stag line at an early FD. '

For the next four years FD was replaced by
similar concerts put on by the Allman Brothers, Sha-
Na-Naand Billy Preston. The 1971 Dance Board chair-
man informed the EC that there would not be a ball
“because of a greatly reduced budget and past history of

Pavilion.” Similar parties that weekend might have
given birth to the headline that graced the 1976 Fancy
Dress edition of The Ring-tumPhi, “Fancy Dress Week-
end arrives; University braces for hangover.” ,

Although similar sentiments about the spirit |,
of the ball have pervaded through the 80’s, into the
90’s, its proportions have once again exceeded any
expectation “Miss Annie” might have had, withthemes_ | *
such as A Diamond Jubilee on its 75th anniversary and | ,

The Wamer Center and Dore-
mus Gymnasium will be elaborately
decorated to transport FD- goers back
to the age of Columbus and the na-
tives he encountered. Each comer will
be transformed to recreate an impor-
tant scene in either the Old World or
the New.

This year’s nine FD decorations
chairmen have researched their pro-
jects thoroughly to create scenes that
are as authentic and beautiful as pos-
sible.

Upon approaching the Ball
along a torch-lined walkway, one will
see a large tapestry of copper, teal
and plum, this year’s FD colors,
adorning the entranceway.

The center’s hallway will entice
all to chose to enter either the Old
World or the New. On the right, will
be ten-foot columns reminiscent of
15th century Italian architecture,
while parallel to them on the left wall
of the hallway will be palm trees
signalling the close proximity of the
tropics, where Columbus landed.

To the right, the columns will
lead into Doremus Gymnasium,
which will be decorated as Ferdi-
nand’s and Isabella’s throne room in
which Columbus’ voyages were com-
missioned and where he told them of

the new lands he had captured for the’
crown. Costumed mannequins will be
placed in the thrones.

Across the way, in the New
World will lie examples of what,
Columbus must have seen as he land-
ed. An Indian village, with grass and’
mud huts and totem poles, which,
were characteristic of area tribes of
the period, will rest on the Warner’
Center balcony. Perhaps inhabitants,
of such dwellings gave Columbus
some of the new plants and animals’
he eventually took back to Spain.

To the left will be a crumbling
Indian temple draped with moss. On’
each side of the temple, will be mu-
rals, as well as palm trees and plants.

One of the largest attractions of
the ball is sure to be the ceiling-high
replica of Columbus’ ship Santa
Maria in the far right corner of the:
Warner Center. The ship was blue-
printed and constructed by members
of the W&L theater department.

In the Warner Center’s far left,
comer will be a recreation of Colum-
bus’ study, as well as instruments
such as maps and an astrolabe, which
he might have used to chart his
course.

Meanwhile, the modern-day
strains of a swing band as well as
reggae and classic rock will entertain
as the ceiling above poses as a twin-
kling Caribbean sky.

Dr. Jefferson Davis Futch's office be-
fore it, too, was taken by the CRC.
After his capture, Futch was beaten
senseless by CRC henchwoman Anice
McCloud and left for dead on the front
lawn.

Moments after the takeover
was complete, CRC Chairwoman Joan
Shaughnessy had herself crowned
Empress of W&L. She allowed CRC
member Allan Vestal to be crowned
emperor, but said Vestal agreed to be
under her control at all times.

“Vestal is an enlightened man
and he realizes he needs to be opressed
by me a little to make up for what his
ancestors did before he was even con-
ceived,” Shaughnessy said. -

By noon, with her CRC
troops firmly in control of the school,
Shaunessy was able to begin her “‘pro-
gram of enlightenment” which in-
cluded mass executions, public cas-
trations and mandatory multi-cultural
slideshows and lectures.

A group of 13 alumni was
executed by firing squad on the prac-
tice football field at 1 om.
Shaughnessy explained her reasons
for ordering their deaths.

“They were white men, that's
all the reason I needed,” she said.

Next, Shaughnessy turned
her wrath on sophomore Billy John
Baker.

“I was in the bathroom and I

overheard two girls in the next stall
say Billy John had whistled at one of
them,” Shaughnessy said. “The boy
needed to be taught a lesson.”

Baker was taken to arally in
the gym and castrated, without
anasthetic, in front of hundreds of
cheering, bra-waving W&L women.

Later that afternoon, the CRC
voted 5-2 to execute EC President
Giles Perkins. He was burned at the
stake.

On Tuesday, Shaughnessy
held a press conference before her
first full day of work as Empress of
W&L.

Shaughnessy said she
recieved had calls of support from the
deans of seven, well-respected north-
eastern schools. She plans toremain in
control of W&L indefinetly.

“My committee's continued
control is necessary to set things
straight, uh, ' mean right, uh, no, I
mean correct,” * she said.

Who survived the coup?

University President John Wilson: dismissed from post but.

jithout injury, “He's never around anyways,” CRC said. -
Dean of Students D d Howison: remains Dean, butno
longer allowed to attend SAC meetings. “Maybe we'll get dut of ©
meetings faster since we won't have to ‘chat’,” said one member,
EC President Giles Perkins: Burned at the stake. Shaughnessy |
herself lit the copies of the U.S. Constitution used as fuel.
IFC President Greg Hicks: left in post, but forced to go on a
date with 6'5" woman lacrosse player who rapes him since ‘she
paid for dinner.” CRC hopes iFC will now help curd date rape.
PHC President Carrie Eubanks: Promoted to under-empress of
W&L. PHC also given de facto control over fraternities,
University Infirmary: now must perform abortions on demand. —

 

 

Delts get none

By Noruinc B.T. Do
Phi Who-Gives-A-Damn Reporter

 

 

University President John D. Wilson announced
today that he is overriding the Student Affairs Committee
and lowering Delta Tau Delta’s penalty for its December
house-trashing to nothing.

“T really didn’t understand what happened at
Delt because SAC screwed up so bad,” Wilson said. “The
Delt president and v p showed me the light.”

“Basically we told John that one of the Phi
editors was solely responsible for all the damage to the
house, and the whole Phi staff collaborated in a con-
spiracy to make Delt look bad,” said the Delt vp “Really,
it’s true. That’s why we expelled him. He would do
anything within his power to hurt us, even witchcraft. We
think there’s been witchcraft.”

Wilson said it was clear to him that SAC asked
all the wrong questions of the Delts.

“SAC asked questions like, ‘what happened?,’
‘what did you do about it?,’ etc.,” Wilson said. “That was
all wrong. I wanted to talk about the future.”

“Talking Jeger the past is always so difficult,” ¢
Delt spokesman said, “Then you might really have oe
responsibility for your actions. Talking about the future
is easier, because since it is hasn’t happened yet, nobody
knows what’s true and what’s not.”

SPECIAL PHI INVESTIGATIVE REPORT

Hoping to cash in on the
wave of sensitivity sweeping the cam-
pus since the CRC's takeover, mem-
bers of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity
announced this morning that mem-
bers are offended by the term “SPE.”

SPE President Ivan Attitude
said SPE has not always minded be-
ing called SPE, but since SPE nation-
als said SPE nationally is broken up
about the SPE term, SPE should go.

Attitude said SPE members
would rather be known as “that sen
sitive bunch of guys at the end of Lee
Avenue,” or “TSBOGATELA,” pro-
nounced, “SBOGATELA,” just like
“Tsongas,” who is not a SPE.

W&L Empress Joan
Shaughnessy said even though the
SPES were abunch of men, she would
issue a decree than anyone calling the
SPES SPES would be shot on site
(unless they were women, minorities
or ugly).

The Ring-tum Phi of course
offered its full cooperation to SPE,
saying the newspaper would hence
forth call all SPEs something differ-
ent than SPEs, so that the newspaper
could affect and alter people’s opin
ions and vocabularies, just like every
one knows they try to do.

“We're really excited about
changing SPEs to somet
than SPEs,” a Phis Sf ag in, who is
not a SPE, said. “The SPEs will be
eSPEcially happy with us.’

Composite Q. Reporter did not turn
in a story this week because s/he
wasn't feeling well, and s/he had

trouble getting in touch with
people. Oh yeah, s/he also can't
write the story, because Dean
Howison asked that we not write
anything about that

 

 

Did Mock Convention's
nomination of Bill Clinton
influence Paul Tsongas
decision to quit?

 

So at first we were going to just
stay up ‘til 3 a.m. and write the
story ourselves like we usually do
Then we decided to just stop the
presses and not come out this
week at all. Finally we decided, oh
well, it's not the reporter's fault,
after all. Let's just put a nice box
there instead

Found September 18, 1897
Lost March 26, 1992

R.T. ‘Smiley’ or
Weekly World?

This week we present you with two views of the Phi
of the future. The choice is yours. Which one do you
want?

R.T. ‘Smiley’ Phi — This is the official ‘‘news’’paper
of the idyllic Washington and Lee that the administration
and most students dream about. Nothing bad ever happens.
Everybody knows and respects one another. Students,
faculty and staff walk around 24 hours a day with a smile
securely painted on their faces. Too bad such a place
doesn’t exist, but this is the Phi everyone seems to think
they want ...

The Weekly World Phi — So you thought you could
compare The Ring-tum Phi to a supermarket tabloid? We
don’t think so. This paper leads with an exclusive expose
on Dean Atkins’ genitalia and goes down from there. It
truly lives up to its ever present motto: ‘‘We’re Gonna
Get Ya!”

That’s all folks,
we're outta here!

OK ... on a more serious note ... take a deep breath
and relax. As you’ve probably guessed, this is the Phi’s
annual parody issue. None of the news stories this week
are either real or serious. In fact, any resemblance to
persons either living or dead are purely intentional.
Particularly to those who are living.

By this time every year, the paper has usually pissed
off so many people that we take this opportunity to
shamelessly pander for your affection by trying to make
you laugh. But if that doesn’t work, we really don’t care.
It’s our last issue! Today we begin a futile attempt to
make up a semester of work in just eight days. In the
spring, the new Editorial Board will take over ... and if
you think you’re happy to see us go, you can’t possibly
comprehend what it means to us.

Have a nice day.

The Ring-tum Phi is published Thursdays during the undergraduate
school year at Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia.
Funding for The Ring-tum Phi comes primarily from advertising, but,
sadly, also from a portion of the student activities fee. The Washington and
Lee Publications Board elects the chief editors and business manager, but
The Ring-tum Phi is otherwise independent and likes it that way.
Letters, submissions and dirty pictures must be in the Phi office, Room
208 of the University Center, by noon Tuesday to appear in that week’s
edition. We observe current court definitions of libel and
obscenity from afar, but we observe Hustler v. Falwell up close.

I’VE CHANGED

By Nile “The River” Macado

 

  

Those of you who know me realize that I am rarely
aman without words (that is, rarely a man). But here I am
speechless. I am so ashamed of the things I have said on
these pages during the past months. It is now the time for
true confessions.

I’ve changed. While reading the Law Wives’ calm
and polite response to my last diatribe, I realized that they
are correct. They are not the ones that misunderstand, I am.
It’s not the values of this fine country that are warped and
twisted, I am. It is not the Spectator that is vomit, I am. I
am, in fact, not part of the solution, I am part of the
problem.

The good Law Wives were quite correct at pointing
out that I am Canadian. I would like to apologize to my
fellow countrymen remaining north of the border for the
embarrassment I have wrought. I am a hypocrite. Every-

s thing has been handed to me, and I have given’ back

 

 

nothing but trouble. That settles it, from now on I’m a
Republican. No more letters from me. I feel right at home
here at W&L.

Ed. note: Yeah, right. Nile, oh Nile, you are puerile, vile
and make me smile, Get back to your Parisian memoirs.

Administrators plan CRC takeover

 

My BRAIN’S FRIED

By John ‘‘Zero-Point-Zero’’ Blutarski

 

A member of The Ring-tum Phi’s intrepid
investigative reporting team sneaks a microphone
into an executive meeting in the President of the
University’s inner sanctum. Names have been
altered to protect the not-so-innocent. The evil
plotters are: University President Johnny Stilson,
Dean of Students Davey Howler and Dean for Co-
educational Affairs Mrs. Scheer-LaRoue.

ek
Stilson: This meeting will come to order, with me
in charge, of course (ha, ha, I love power).
Howler: Oh, yes sir, that sounds quite good to me.
Scheer-LaRoue: Why does he get to be in charge
all the time, hmm? Sounds like male chauvinism,
if you ask me!
Stilson: We didn’t. (Bangs gavel) We are here to
discuss that muckraking, back-stabbing rag, that
filthy piece of yellow journalism, that ... student
publication.
Howler: The Spectator?
Stilson: No, you idiot, the Phi!
Howler: (Fawning) Oh yes, quite right, sir!
Stilson: And that sneaky little columnist of their’s,
Sparrow —
Scheer-LaRoue: Swann.
Stilson: Sparrow, swan, parakeet... who cares? This
libelist should be strung by his ...
Scheer-LaRoue: Go ahead, say it, sir! Go ahead,
you can do it!
Stilson: Vulgarity doesn’t fit my new urbane
image. By the way, Davey, are the students going
for it?
Howler: Oh, sir, yes sir, they love it. Your popu-

Cramps bother
depressed dean

Dear Phi Guys:

I have this little problem, and I hope you can
help me. Upon returning from a relaxing Christ-
mas break, I sat down at my desk with about
1,200 upperclassmen fall term grade reports.
You know, parents love to see their little kid
complemented on his report card ...

I was in the middle of writing my little
messages ... you know the type: ‘‘Your son is a
really nice kid. I see him in my office all the
time.’’ ‘‘Don’t worry Chris has a full year to get
his grade-point-average above a 2.0.’’ and the
ever popular, ‘‘I failed calculus, too!’’ When
just then I began developing this sharp pain in
my arm which eventually spread to my neck and
the rest of my body.

So, I began consulting with doctors and
chiropractors. I took medication and attempted
neck-extension therapy with Tom Jones in the
Training Room. When all else failed, I resorted
to acu-puncture treatment. I was finally told to
sleep on my side instead of my stomach. BUT
1 ALWAYS SLEEP ON MY STOMACH! I
CAN’T SLEEP! I AM BECOMING UNSTA-
BLE! This has been going on for 11 weeks
now. What should I do? I’ve considered filing
law suits against W&L for on-the-job-abuse,
against the students for getting grades and
against the doctor who told me to sleep on my
side. Please give me some advice. I have to do
the grade reports again in just two weeks!

Eagerly awaiting your reply,
Davey Howison
Dean of Students

Ed. note — Listen Davey, sue the university,
they'll just raise tuition to cover it. But don’t
sign the agreement until you get your own
building on the Colonnade. Just think of it:
Howison Hall ... your name in lights. No more
being forced to sit in front of the Co-op for you!
Next, make up a stamp that says ‘‘Your doing a
great job. — DH’’ and see to it that everyone
gets straight A’s ... Oh, yeah ... don’t forget to
sleep on your side.

 

 

Listen in as the university
president and his crack team of
barracudas destroy civil liberties
on this campus forever!

 

larity is catching up to the President’s!
Stilson: Excellent ... now about this Swann charac-
ter.
Scheer-LaRoue: Obviously a sexually-deviant
male, or highly repressed. Needs a mother figure.
Stilson: All I know is the sneaky little bastard
verbally assaulted Leroy last fall.
Howler: Oh, that wasn’t nice, sir. Certainly not
good at all to attack the Dean of Social Affairs and
Promiscuity.
Scheer-LaRoue: Called him a toad, didn’t he?
Obviously referring subconsciously to himself.
Definite sexual problems.
Stilson: And that entire staff! Who do they think
they are, mucking about with the Delt decision?
Howler: That’s right, sir, if they hadn’t blabbed
we'd have kicked those punks right off campus.
Stilson: And who the hell leaked the car tax bit?
Bettcha it that do-gooder Brian Shaw had some-
thing to do with it. Everything he says is bullshit!
Scheer-LaRoue: Too bad Homer’s deal with the
University fell through, isn’t it? I would have
gotten a whole new Womyn’s Center, too.
Howler: Uh, sir? You don’t think there’s ... well,
a microphone hidden somewhere in here, do you?
**Tense silence**
Stilson: (Guffawing) You mean The Spectator?
I’ve got those fools in my back pocket. Next week
they’ll attack the Buildings and Grounds people

LETTERS

A message from
Her Majesty

To the Editors:

There have been many false and truly
harassing reports of what precipitated my recent
ascension as “The Almighty Empress of
Washington and Lee, Protector of the
Everlasting Honor.’’ This letter is to set the
record straight. I don’t expect ya'll to
understand, after all you’re both white males
(and soon to be dead).

The tension on this campus has been growing
steadily for about the past 250 years: fraternities
are bad, this school is named after two dead
slave-owners, the white male-dominated elector-
ate continues to vote for other white males and
just yesterday somebody implied that I was
ugly. Obviously something had to change.

But the changes will be minimal. The school
will remain where it is, we will just be changing
the name to Homerville Community College.
The Honor System and other vestiges of student
government will remain intact, they will just be
carefully overseen by members of the CRC.
Free elections will continue, as usual, just we
will screen the candidates and implement a
proportional voting system to benefit the under-
represented minorities. Finally, we will not
tamper with the civil liberties of the students
here unless they do not know when to censor
themselves.

The current 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. curfew should
only be necessary for a few years. So, sit back
and relax ... there’s nothing you can do. Have
fun with you issue this week — it’s your last.

 

Regally yours,
Her Royal Majesty
Queen Joan |

Ed. Note: To all you who wrote
to us this past year ... | hope |
never see another letter again!

instead of me... AGAIN.
Scheer-LaRoue: When you say ‘‘back pocket,’’ do
you mean anything inherently sexual about —
Stilson: Oh shut up. To continue ... what do we do
about this deranged columnist?
Scheer-LaRoue: I suggest extensive psycho-thera-
py. Put him ... I mean, the case, into my hands.
Howler: I don’t know, sir, he’s got a cult follow-
ing among the students. It could backlash.
Stilson: A following?
Howler: Sick people, sir, but extremely loyal.
Stilson;: How come / don’t have a following?
Check on it! Can’t the CRC do anything about
him?

** Pquse**
Howler: My sources say he was seen drinking at
the Palms last weekend. And he was seen dancing
at the Fiji house.
Scheer-LaRoue: Definitely sexually-deprived.
Stilson: No, the entire student body drinks at the
Palms, so do the profs... So do I. And the Fiji thing
won't wash, either — that might make him desper-
ate, but not immoral.
Scheer-LaRoue: Maybe I could persuade some of ‘
my female disciples to —
Stilson: No, the man’s an English major. Moral
character’s too strong.

** Pquse**
Howler: I’ve got it! (murmured whispers...our
intrepid reporter can’t catch the words)
Stilson: By God, Davey, that just might work!
Now nobody on this campus will be subject to
ridicule or harassment ever again ...

CRC takes control;
reign of terror begins

Lawyers thankful
for building sale

To the Editor:

As a law-firm having recently moved to
Lexington, we would like to take this opportuni-
ty to publicly thank the Washington and Lee
University administration for the warm welcome
they have extended to us. Specifically, we refer
to the brochure we received detailing the scho-
ol’s excellent opportunities to express monetary
generosity.

Since, having originated our firm in Houston,
we have gobs of liquid assets with which to
paper this municipality, the aforementioned
brochure was particularly helpful. Our original
intent of giving the city a fleet of brand-spank-
in’ new parking scooters was clearly upstaged
by the recently donated snorkel fire truck. So,
instead we have decided upon item C in the
brochure: ‘‘prominent Colonnade building
named for donor, with endowed professorship.”’

Frankly, we were at first concerned with
defacing the natural greenery and beauty of the
Colonnade, but the information packet from
President Wilson and the Board of Trustees
quelled any such fears. The Faculty/Student
Opinion Cross-Section was what really did the
trick. We found the comments of a Dr. Satz in
the mathematics department most moving:
‘There just aren’t enough buildings around here
to piddle on!’’ Satz said. ‘Besides, each new
slab of concrete means one or two less trees for
cats to climb up.’’ Even now, we stifle tears at
the beauty of that sentiment.

One again, thank you.

Sincerely,
Dewey, Skrewum and Howe
Attorneys at Law

Theater men
dress up and
get down

By Homo Puosic
Archie Bunker Wanna Be

 

 

After a long year of thought provoking
drama, three senior theater majors dress up in their
most stunning outfits and dance the night away to
their favorite Village People tunes. Theirimpromptu
performance of "Kick Me There, I'll Kick Your Ass"
received a standing ovation from students assembled
in front of the co-op.

Butch Browning, donning a pink tutu and
stunning pink toe shoes, felt the performance was a
success.

"The woman inside me has finally had the |) > Jigaly set

said. "I represent women and their role as thé op-
pressed insignificant other, tightly bound by society's
tutu."

Blaine Dixon, sporting an oh-so stylish
umbrella, agrees with Browning.

"It was great fun," said Dixon, "and Butch
will make a great FD date."

According to Dixon, he represents the hope
of a future free from racial and sexual tension getting
shafted by the oppresive white male of contemporary
society. "It's deep," Dixon said. "It really is."

Paul Tsmith, says the oppresive male char-
acter he portrays is the complete antithesis of what a
truly sensitive guy he is. "I am a sensitive kind of
guy," Tsmith said. "I really am."

Members of the audience also believed the
performance to be a success.

"It was great," one student said. "It was
better than Cats."

Homer vacations with
YOUR tax money

After more than 12 months of
saying that he had nothing to do with
the car tax, Lexington Mayor HE.
“Homer” Derrick admitted Wednes-
day that the tax has paid for his re-
peated trips to the Bahamas.

“Look, my trips to the Baha-
mas are my own business,” Homer
said. “Just because the city collects
money from students and then pays for
meto have alittle fun in the sun doesn’t
mean that the two are connected.

“The trips have nothing to do
with W&L or the car tax,” Homer said.
“Bryan Shaw [W&L’s public relations
man, who is not a SPE] is right, tying
the car tax to anything is bullshit.”

Homer, who is not a SPE,
rejected the idea that a flat tax on all
cars, regardless of their value, is fair.
He said that the 4.25 percent tax rate is
needed to cover the increased road and
sidewalk maintenance costs that ex-
pensive cars incur.

“The more expensive the car,
the more damage it does to the road,”
Homer said. “Look, kids with more
expensive cars are richer. Richer kids
have less regard for nature. And Kids
with less regard for nature litter more.
Therefore, expensive cars damage
roads more than cheap cars.”

Besides, if those W&L
babies don’t like it,
they can just vote me out
of office next time!

— Homer

 

 

Additionally, Homer said, the
tax is justified by the income hehas lost
at the College Town Shop, which Mrs.
Homer runs.

“Ever since the Phi printed
my phone number, students have
stopped coming into the little woman’s
store,” Homer said. “I figure the bas-
tards owe me.

“Besides, if those W&L ba-
bies don’t like it, they can just vote me

out of office next time,” the mayor
said.

Homer said that students sim-
ply must register to vote with the city
registrar, Lucille “I am the Law” Joyce.

The registrar, the mother of
Assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney
Robert Joyce Jr., said students are wel-
come to try to register.

“I dare them to come down
and try it,” the Law said. “When stu-
dents grow up and get out in the real
world, then they can vote.”

While students do have
certain rights, Joyce said, voting is not
necessarily one of them.

“Here in Lexington, no one
votes unless I say so,” the Law said,
“and I don’t like students --- or their
fancy cars.

“If anyone has a problem with
that they can file a lawsuit. What, is my
son gonna prosecute me?”

On perhaps the only bright
side of this whole issue, Homer did get
a serious sunburn on the top of his bald
head during his last trip to the bahamas

funded its bid to host the Games with
drug money and elected to move the
games. Although W&L did not make
a bid, they were awarded the games
for free because of its history of
honor.

“*For nearly a month, W&L will
become the focal point of the world,”’

said University President John
Wilson. ‘‘That can do nothing but
bolster the University’s already

perfect image. And we're getting it
for free.”’

Olympic officials said that despite
the small size of both Lexington and
W&L, ‘‘the games must go on. We’re
positive that W&L will prove to be
both an adequate and an outstanding
host to the countries of the world.”’

The Games will be held begin
July 26 and end August 15.

There had been some question as
to W&L’s ability to run the Games
smoothly because of its size and the
lack of a large city in the immediate

Washington and Lee coaches
must now be wary of the way they
treat players or even the way they
criticize their performances.

The Confidential Review
Committee released an amendment to
their conduct code recommendation,
calling for coaches to be put under its
umbrella of influence. The
amendment states that coaches may
no longer ‘‘single out, punish or
demean players because of their
physical or mental shortcomings on

vicinity.

“‘That’s bullshit,’ said W&L
spokesman Brian Shaw. ‘‘There are
two cities within an hour that are
more than capable of handling the
consumer rush the Olympic Games
will bring. And as far as the athletics
goes, we have more than enough
fields, stadiums and gymnasiums. We
have no doubts that the Games will
go smoothly.’’

Staunton, to the north, and
Roanoke, to the south, will be the
primary distribution points for Olym-
pic merchandise. There will also be
stores in downtown Lexington.

“We see this as a great oppor-
tunity to put a lot of money we had-
n’t counted on into the economy,”’
said Lexington mayor H. E. ‘‘Buddy’”’
Derrick.

The opening ceremony will be
held July 26. For its final leg, the
Olympic torch will be run from Fair-
field down U.S. route 11, past the
Lee-Hi Truck Stop and Restaurant —
caterers to the Olympic Games — into
town, past VMI, across the foot-
bridge and onto Wilson Field, where
the teams will enter.

W&L history professor Taylor
Sanders will carry the torch on its
final leg.

“This is a fine opportunity,’
Sanders. *‘

’ said
Just as the Greeks consider

it an honor, I do as well.’’

To honor the ancient olympians,
Sanders will jog the final leg naked,
as the Greeks did.

The venues for the sporting
events will be spread out across cam-
pus. The track and field events will
take place on Wilson Field and the
football practice field. The basketball
competition will take place in the
Warner Center. The gymnastics com-
petition will take place in the Dor-
emus Gym, adjacent to the 2,500 seat
Warner Center.

Soccer will be held on the Liberty
Hall Field, and baseball will be
played at Smith Field. Swimming and
water polo will be held in the Cy
Twombly Pool, and the weightlifting
competition will be held in the War-
ner Center weight room. Tennis will
be played on the Varsity Courts.

Boxing and wrestling will be held
at the Pavilion.

“*The athletic facilities will be in
tip-top shape,’’ said W&L Athletic
Director Mike Walsh. ‘‘They are
some of the finest fields in America,
and we are proud and ready for the
world to take to them.”’

American athletes didn’t seem
concerned with the lack of size of the
arenas.

“*T’ve never played in a gym with

less than 10,000 seats,’’ said

basketball player Michael Jordan. ‘‘I
think it will be neat. Plus, they have
a McDonald’s so I’ll be able to do
some endorsements. Don’t they?’’

Swimmers expressed some
concern about W&L’s shorter-than
Olympic length Twombly Pool
(capacity 500). The pool is 25 yards
long and only 12 feet deep. Standard
olympic pools are 50 meters by 15
feet.

“I’ve never had to do a flip-turn °

in the 50-meters,’’ said Matt Biondi,
who stands six feet, seven inches. ‘‘It
should be really interesting, also.”’

Walsh insisted that the facilities
would pose no problems for the
athletes.

“They are the world’s greatest
athletes, excepting of course the
athletes of Major League baseball,”’
he said. ‘“‘They should be able to
adjust to their surroundings without
complaining.”’

The Olympic Village for athletes
will be comprised of W&L’s student
housing facilities. Athletes will reside
in the four dormitories, Gaines Hall,
Woods Creek and the dormitories in
the lower levels of the Warner
Center.

“‘As always, the women will
reside on the third floor of the fresh-
men dorms,’ said W&L_ security
officer Baner. ‘‘Even though the

Olympics. They are modeling what they will wear at the Games. —

students aren’t here, we can’t have
any trouble now — buddy.”’

The University, however, will not
open the newly renovated fraternity
houses to the Olympic athletes.

““We have spent too much time
and effort renovating them,’’ said
Wilson. ‘‘We can’t run the risk of
these strangers to our community
coming in and doing damage to
them.”’

The Olympic committee spoke
with W&L about using some of
VMI’s athletic facilities, but decided
not to press the ‘issue when both
Wilson and Walsh said W&L’s
facilities were more than sufficient.

‘Really, we saw no need to bring
VMI into this,”’ said Wilson.

“This is our project and we are

more than capable of handling it,’’
said Walsh. ‘‘We have worked long
and hard and we don’t need to give
VMI some free notoriety after all our
hard work.”’

Despite the unexpected and untold
amounts of money that the Games
should bring into the city, Derrick
said he would not consider changing
any of the city’s tax structures, most
notably the taxing of W&L student
automobiles.

““We’ve gone around and around
about this in Council,’’ said Derrick.
“The bottom line is, that no matter
how much money we make from the
Olympics being here — and it is sure
to be a lot — the students will return
after the Games. And if they have
cars, then they’ll have a tax.”’

reign; W&L coaches join the growing list of CRC victims

the playing field.”’

According to the CRC, this
amendment will secure a player
against the obvious abuses of any
athletic coach.

‘‘What are ‘shortcomings’?
This is going to cause major
problems for us,”’ said one coach.

This doesn’t bode well for
W&L coaches trying to discipline
their players and get them ready for a
season. This amendment will produce
repercussions on every team at W&L.

Head football coach Gary
Fallon can no_ longer criticize
offensive linemen for missing blocks

which result in the massacring of the
quarterback.

Head basketball coach Verne
Canfield can no longer make a player
run extra suicides for refusing to play
because an opposing player said he
needed to use deodorant before
games.

Men’s swimming coach Page
Remillard can no longer make a
swimmer swim extra laps for deciding
during a race to take a break and
walk the rest of the way.

Women’s lacrosse coach Jan
Hathom can no longer bench a player
for refusing to remove her pink

 

spandex and replace them with the

Head soccer coach Rolf
Piranian can no longer bench a player
for scoring a goal in his own net
because he was mad at the keeper for
stealing his date at a frat party.

Head baseball coach Jeff
Stickley can no longer yell at a player
for missing a fly ball because he was
checking out the girls lacrosse team
practicing on Liberty Field.

Women’s tennis coach Cinda
Rankin can no longer make a player
Tun extra sprints for smashing tennis
balls over the fence because she

wants to protest the lack of a
women’s mud wrestling team.

I could go on, but I think you
get my drift. This new amendment is
a travesty. f

“It will probably cause total
anarchy for a while,’ said one
anonimous CRC representative, ‘“but
after some time, the coaches will get
used to the change.”’

An even bigger travesty is the
fact this amendment doesn’t include
some of the professors who level
students with unnecessary
punishments, such as grades.

A woman who says she

cision to take steroids was wrong.

“Men justdon’tunderstand

doesn’t matter if you’re four-foot-
nothing and 102 pounds, so long as
you’re hung like a bull.”

So why did he take the
plunge into drugs? CRC Chairman
Joan Shaughnessy, a self-proclaimed
.experton the male psyche, said Bud-
dy’s problem was self-esteem.

“Like most vertically chal-
lenged men, Buddy did not think he

Senior dorm
counselor Nancy Noname
and Ring-tum Phi yellow
sensationalist Molly
Muckraker disemboweled
each other yesterday in
front of the Co-op, to the
horror of 25 students who
witnessed the event.

Witnesses said
Muckraker, 20, was
emerging from Reid Hall at
the same moment Noname,
21, left the C-School.

They spotted each
other across the expanse of
juniper bushes and the
battle was on.

Muckraker, who
was carrying a 3-foot brass
anchor used for the annual
‘Revive Delta Gamma”
benefit, struck first, blud-
geoning Noname_ and
wounding her severely.

Noname produced a
sword she said had been
given to her by a former
Marine, with whom she
denied sleeping.

Noname drove the
sword into Muckraker,

penetrating her and
partially disembowel-
ing her.

From there, the
battle raged on as the wom-
en, interlocked in a bloody
tangle, circled the C-School
seven times, leaving a trail
of intestines.

Politics Professor
Lewis John, who happened
to be looking out his office

during the encounter said
he saw nothing.

agreed.

“TY can’t believe

MacFarland said. ‘‘This

incident was not an asset to
the University.’’

Noname finally got
the upper hand in the bat-
tle when she caught Muck-
raker around the neck and
smashed her brains out
against the ODK benches.

Victorious, Noname
attempted to drag Muck-
raker’s body off to show
the girls on her hall in
Gilliam Dormitory. How-
ever, Noname got only as
far as the steps to the Co-
op before she died from her
wounds.

Student Conduct
Committee President Chris
Haley said the incident was
a ‘personal dispute’’ be-
tween the two women and
that the SCC would not get
involved.

Will she croak? Bagenris

 

By DASTARDLY DAMIEN
Phi Evil Doer

Mrs. Betty Bucks, donator
of fine pottery, spiked a 102 degree
fever and was admitted to the hospital
yesterday,

Bucks, whose life has lin-
gered longer than university officials
expected, is supposed to croak this
time, according to her doctor Elmer
“Buddy” Fudd.

“She’s old,” said Dr. Fudd.
“Old folks don’t fight off fevers too
well. This is it.”

According to Fudd it’s dif-
ficult to nail down just how much
longer Bucks will continue to breath.

“Tt could be an hour, or it
could be a week, but it can’t be too
long ‘cause we need the extra beds,”
Fudd said.

When told about Bucks’
recenthealth scare, W&L’s greatcom-
municator Brian Shaw said “No shit!”

“The university has been
looking forward to the day we would
get all the Bucks stuff with bated
breath,” said Shaw. “I’m so thrilled I
could weep.”

President John D. Wilson
also expressed positive feelings to-
wards Bucks fastapproaching doom.

“AssoonasI heard, I called
dining services and had them put 80
cases of champagne on ice,” Wilson
said. “As soon as the old girl drops
dead I’m popping the first cork.

Wilson asserted that the
champagne would be for everyone
who has supported the plans for the
Bucks estate.

“You think I’m going to
share the champagne with all you
scum who opposed my plans for the
estate? No way,” Wilson said. “Buy
your own damn champagne, this is
my party and I'll invite who I want
to.”

Wilson did pause a mo-
ment in his reverie to ponder how
Bucks was holding up emotionally
during the final ticks of her biological
clock.

“The reaper will be knock-
ing at Bucks’ door any day now, I
wonder if she’s scared,” Wilson asked.
“Aww, what does it matter, I bet she
thinks her old man’ll be waiting for
her on the other-side anyway.”

Both Shaw and Wilson
agree that Bucks’ donation will do
good things for W&L’s reputation.

“U.S. News and World
Reports can’t ignore us now,” Shaw
said.

Wilson seems to think that

Bucks’ death will raise even more
money for W&L than she has do-
nated.

“After she agreed to give
us all her stuff, the faculty and admin-
istrators took out a betting pool for
the day she would die,” he said. “No
one placed bets for the next three
days, so if she goes soon W&L gets
the money, and it’s a fair sum of
dough.”

One professor seems to
think she has a good chance at win-
ning the money. French Professor
Kathy Jo Koberstein put money on
everyday of next week.

“Tjusthad this really strong
feeling,” Koberstein said. “I’m sure if
Mrs. Bucks knew a woman had a
chance of winning a lot of money if
she would just live a few more days,
she would hang on.”

Koberstein, however does
not know where she stands with Wil-
son.

“T was against this whole
Bucks Estate Plan in the beginning,
but the trustees made me see the light,
and then again I didn’t really have a
choice,” she said. “I just hope Pres.
Wilson knows I’m all for itnow, and
lets me have some of that champagne
I’ve been hearing about. I’m sure it’s
better than that stuff they serve at the
moose lodge.”

W&L NAILED WITH VEGAS VIOLATIONS!

 

By RICHARD F. PERRY
Phi Las Vegas Gambler

 

A Nevada grand jury
today indicted the Washington
and Lee athletic department in
connection with numerous NCAA
violations at U.N.L.V.

“‘T said all along that we
ran a clean program and that the
NCAA was out to get us,’’ said
relieved and reinstated U.N.L.V.
basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian.
“Now maybe the NCAA will get

off my back and let me get back
to coaching these fine people.’’

W&L president John
Wilson was shocked at the news
of the indictment, but kept his
composure about the matter.

‘This is a delicate mat-
ter,’” he said, ‘‘and I’d rather not
talk about it until I get in touch
with our lawyers.”’

The NCAA has yet to
state what action it will take
against the tiny Division III
school, since the normal penalty

includes limiting of scholarships
and W&L doesn’t give scholar-
ships.

W&L head basketball
coach Verne Canfield denied that
he had anything to do with sabo-
taging UNLV.

“Why on earth would I
want to do that?’’ he said. ‘‘It’s
been years since I had my heart
set on getting a Division I job.’’

W&L Athletic Director
Mike Walsh, who is in just his
third year at the helm, denied

said. ‘‘I think that one of the

Infirmary scraps
AIDS teaching

Students just don't need it

By Lone D. SILVER
Phi Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee Infir-
mary has scrapped all plans to educate
students about AIDS, because everyone
knows that those kinds of things just
don’t happen here.

“I confess that, when AIDS hys-
teria first came about, I was a bit ner-
vous,” said Dr. Jane Horton of the Infir-
mary. “Now, I realize W&L is too good to
allow that kind of low-class disease. Why,
if the virus were to attack someone here,
it would just be thrown right out of the
body.”

Horton attributes this incredible
ability to repel the HIV-virus to a rare
antibody known as amazingus
arrogantus. It is believed that the anti-
body is passed on to freshmen when they
go through matriculation in September.

“For some reason, God has
blesses these wonderful students with the
superhuman power to defy all the laws of
nature,” Horton said.

Horton said that she was con-
tinuing herresearch, and that itis possible
that W&L students are also immune from
other common problems as well.

“It’s possible that this is the be-
ginning of some sort of master race. You
lucky men and women may never have to
face such ailments as heart disease, male
pattern baldness or the heartbreak of pso-
riasis,” Horton said. “Wouldn’t that be
wonderful?”

Jury lies, says EC member stole

 

By H.V. TRULY
Phi Staff Reporter

A member of the Executive
Committee was convicted Friday of break-
ing and entering and grand larceny, but
since all W&L students are honest, moral
people, it’s obvious the Rockbridge
County Circuit Court jury was wrong.

The sophomore EC member was

sentenced to one year in the state peniten-

tiary, but is eligible for parole in early
August. The Phi is withholding his name
in case he wants to run for EC again after
his release.

The sophomore denied that his
conviction would affect his ability to judge
honor trials in the future.

“T just don’t think it’s relevant,”
he said. “In fact, it’s none of anyone’s
business. How dare the Phi go snooping
in public records like this!”

The jury found the EC member
guilty of breaking into another W&L
student’s room and stealing a television
and stereo. The victim, a junior, refused
to comment on the crime.

“T really don’t want anyone to
know that I am a crime victim,” said the
junior. “I mean, what would people think
if they knew my life wasn’t perfect? It

As a result of a generous
promise of a $10 donation from the
conglomeration Pepsico, Washington and
Lee officials say they will slightly
restructure Lee Chapel to honor the gift.

A Pepsico spokesman presented
a giant, mock check, along with a bucket
of Hot Wings, to highly esteemed W&L
President John D. Wilson, at one of the

Wilson said Pepsico hinted
there might be more where that came
from, but they didn’t specify whether
they meant money or Hot Wings.

“‘Regardless, we’ve decided to
move the clock on top of Lee Chapel
and replace it with that jaunty red and
white Kentucky Fried Chicken roof.”’

Wilson said the gift actually

Students

virgins,

new survey says

 

By U.B. KIDDING
Phi Staff Reporter

 

A very bored Dean of
Student Sexuality and other
Moral Dangers Mrs. Larry La-
mont announced today that a
new survey on student sexuality
revealed that all W&L students
are virgins saving themselves for
their marriage night.

““My hard work all
these years has finally paid off,”’
said Mrs. Lamont. ‘‘Students
have seen the light and are ab-
staining.”’

Mrs. Lamont said most
students said they hardly ever
think about sex, never watch or
read pomography, and report
living very fulfilled lives.

Lamont also said, how-
ever, that 20 percent of the stu-
dents said they had kissed some-
one on the first date and a hand-
ful said they had seen a member

of the opposite sex in the nude.

‘“‘Hopefully these few
students will understand the
danger of being tempted into the
pit of carnal desires, a life of
hellfire and sexually-transmitted
diseases,’’ Mrs. Lamont said. ‘‘]
just hope these at-risk students
will come in for counselling.’’

Similar surveys at area
women’s colleges show that their
students are sexually frustrated,
and that some have resorted to
travelling to Hampden-Sydney
for the one-night stands they
used to enjoy at W&L.

“‘T don’t know when the
W&L guys got so frigid, but
they just don’t want to do the
wild thing any more,”’ said Ima
Slut, who attends a Buena Vista
finishing school.

When told about the
survey results, Pretty Boy Brian
Shaw had just one comment.

“*Bullshit.”’

would ruin my reputation as a
normal W&L student.”’

The - prosecution
presented several hours of
testimony and evidence linking
the EC member to the theft, but
obviously it was all lies.

Dean of All the Perfect
Students David L. Howison
testified on behalf of the EC
member during the trial.

“T’ve known _ [this
student] since he came to W&L,
and he has always seemed to be
a fine, upstanding citizen,’’ said

Howison. ‘‘I just don’t see why
should convict him solely on

travesty of justice.”’

To avoid any confusion,
the Phi staff would like to make
it perfectly clear that we all

no faith whatsoever in the
United States criminal justice
system. Students can all trust
each other and leave their doors
unlocked all day and night,
because everyone knows that
bad things just don’t happen at

structure like Lee Chapel.
“*Since the Colonnade is

God knows, the president of
W&L can do no wrong.

“That old chapel has
needed a little ‘spicing up’ for a
long time anyway,’’ chortled
Wilson. He’s so clever.

Wilson said the chapel’s
interior might be redesigned as
well. For example, the first 100-
gallon deep fryer Sanders ever
used will be displayed in Lee’s
office, as will a shrine detailing
the evolution of KFC’s “‘Original
Recipe,”’ and a lock of Sanders’
hair.

W&L Director of Truth-
ful and Complete Information
Brian Shaw said the modification
to Lee Chapel is in no way a
kickback to Pepsico.

“Tying together the
issue of the red-and-white roof
on Lee Chapel and the Pepsico
donation is bullshit,’’ Shaw said.

But of course no stu-
dents made that connection any-
way, because nothing ever hap-
pens behind closed doors at
WAL. We all trust each other.

Shaw said the KFC lead
may have sparked a rash of Pep-
sico donations, sighting discus-
sion of a Taco Bell mezzanine in
the Lenfest Center.

““We’re just not sure
theater crowds can handle the hot
taco sauce,’’ Shaw said. ‘‘Bull-
shit.”’

A truly

By Wenpy O’Micop
Phi Woman At Large

 

Mrs. Betty Bucks, kind and generous
benefactor of the Bucks Estate and all that neat
pottery, has come down with a 102 degree
fever.

Bucks’ doctor Elmer“Buddy” Fudd
said he expects Buck to be fine in a few days.

“It’s just a fever. Don’t ya'll at that
university get fevers,” Fudd asked. “Don’t
worry, she’s not going anywhere just yet.”

Bucks condition has caused great
concern throughout the university community.

“We're quite concerned with Mrs.
Bucks health,” President John D. Wilson said.
“She’s such a fine old gal, we’re going to see
what we can do for her.”

Brain Shaw, W&L’s great commu-
nicator said every effort is being made to let
Mrs. Bucks know W&L is pulling for her.

“Several students have come to me
saying we should start a massive letter writing
campaign, and by gosh that is just what we’ve
done,” Shaw said.

According to Shaw, the first truck-

day morning. Mrs. Buck’s butler Buford T.
Winthrop confirmed the delivery of the get well
letters and cards.

“Oh! Mrs. Bucksis so thrilled! youre
nice Mr. Wilson sent her flowers,” Winthrop
said.

Mrs. Bucks herself telephoned this
reporter because she wanted to express her
extreme gratitude to the W&L community.

“T never thought that many strangers
could care,” she said. “I’ve decided that I need
to do something more for the kids.”

So Mrs. Bucks has decided to make
yet another donnation of the porcelin kind.

“T’ve decided to give the dining hall
my everyday dinner dishes,” Bucks said. “I
hear they are in desperate need of clean dishes
over there.”

Director of food services Gerald
Darrell is ecstatic about the donnation.

“T hear they have a lovely light blue
floral pattern on them,” Darrell said. “They
should match very well with our existing dinner
ware.”

“T’ll just use my good china,” she
said.

Many students on campus are very
pleased with the new donation.

“She’s such a sweet woman,” said
student Kirsti Krunch, “I’m looking so forward
to gazing at pretty dishes while I eat.

Student Joey-Rob Doogin also had
an interesting perspective on the new dishes.

“Tt’s cool, but what happens when
we use them all? They'll be just as bad as the
rest,” Doogin said. “I guess it doesn’t matter
though, ‘cause this Bucks chick is alright.”

Student Tammy Tootin summed up
the whole issue perfectly.

“Wow, I wrote heraletter, but never
dreamed she would be this generous,” Tootin
said. “It just goes to show how fara little human
kindess will go.”

However, there was at least one stu-
dent who does not understand the meaning of
generosity and kindness.

“What do I care? I don’t eat in the
damn dining hall anyway,” said Bad Attitude

Duke’s Parks says hello W&L

By MULDOON
Phi WHO?

 

For all those fanatical
Duke fans that I know, and I
know of only one, I have some
good and bad news for you.

The good news is that
your team survived to the Sweet
Sixteen, how I will never know.

The bad news is that
Cherokee Parks will be leaving
Duke next year to attend, and
play basketball, at our humble
institution, Washington and Lee
University.

Pretty neat, ain’t it?

I know your probably

pulling your hair out over this,
but just think, you'll be able to
see him up close(not with Roy
Firestone) and personal. That’s
got to be some consolation to
you.

The reasons Parks gave
for his sudden decision was the
lack of playing time he was
receiving behind All-American
Christian Laettner.

Parks said he felt left
out by Coach K.(I’m not even
going to attempt to spell it), and
that he wanted to be a bigger part
of a team. He also said that
Laettner was the biggest ball-hog
he’d ever played with.

Despite Parks

impressive credentials, head
basketball coach Verne Canfield
says Parks may need a little time
to adjust to the Generals system.

“I’m not sure he’ll start
right away,’’ said Canfield after
he heard the news.

“Parks is a great talent,
but there are others in front of
him that know the system better.
I figure he’ll have it down by the
third or fourth second of
tryouts.”’

Law student
drops civil suit
against W&L

By GREG PATTERSON
Phi Assistant News Editor

 

A Washington and Lee law student who sued the
university because he couldn’t sleep dropped the suit
Wednesday.

Woods Creek East resident Christopher Rau, a third-
year law student, had claimed that noise froma construction
generator at the university heating and cooling plant woke
him at 7 a.m. for five consecutive weeks.

Rau had asked university officials to begin the construc-
tion later in the day or to buffer the sound, he said, but W&L
would only offer to let him sleep in an empty room in an
occupied apartment in Woods Creek Central. Rau refused.

In response the university filed a motion calling him
“irresponsible and reckless” for filing the suit and asking
the court to dismiss it and make Rau pay W&L’s legal fees
for the case.

The university argued that the generator did not violate
city law. Rau claimed that W&L violated a “covenant of
quiet enjoyment” that every lease in Virginia implies.

In the first hearing of the case before Lexington Gen-
eral District Court, Judge Joseph E. Hess asked Rau to
present more evidence before Hess heard the case.

At the April 7 second hearing, Hess excused himself
from the case, saying he was doing fundraising for W&L.
However, Hess said he had been leaning toward granting
W&L’s motion for Rau to pay the school’s fees.

After the hearing Rau told W&L’s attorney, Leanne
Shank, that he would drop the suit if W&L would drop its
motion for sanctions and give him a letter of apology, he
said. She refused.

Rau said the university later offered to drop its motion
if he would agree to pay the costs, which Rau was told
totaled $1,200. He refused.

On Wednesday, Rau said, he agreed to the university’s
offer that it drop the motion and not ask him to pay any fees
if he would drop his suit.

University Treasurer Lawrence Broomall said he saw
no reason “to continue to accrue costs that [Rau] couldn’t
possibly pay if we pressed him.”

Broomall dismissed Rau’s claim thata university should
accomodate student sleeping habits. “It was a frivolous
claim, certainly not worthy of a third-year law student.”

restructuring of W&L's choral groups.

Single-sex choruses to be axed

New group, the Chamber Singers, to be created next fall

 

By Tom HEspos
Phi Staff Reporter

The Women’s Chorus and Glee Club will cease to exist
at Washington and Lee after this year.

According to Dr. Gordon Spice, head of the music
department, the current arrangement of choruses will un-
dergo a “restructuring” that calls for the end of the two
groups.

“The Women’s Chorus and Glee Club will be replaced
by a new group,” said Spice. “We're getting rid of the
single-sex choruses.”

The new group, called the Chamber Singers, will be
composed of 12 male and 12 female students. Spice will

conduct the new group. Singers who do not get into the new
ensemble will be able to sing for the University Chorus,
which will be expanded to take on more members.

Spice currently conducts the University Chorus, but
will shift those conducting responsibilities to music lecturer
Courtney Birch next year.

Spice said the restructuring will not affect Southern
Comfort or JubiLee in any way.

Ray Peeler, a freshman Glee Club member, said the
restructuring is due to the fact that Spice “can’t handle the
workload with classes and rehearsals all day.”

Peeler also said that with a small group of students in
the Chamber Singers, competition for spots in the group
could arise.

From staff reports

 

 

Former President Jimmy Carter
will speak Monday at 7:30 p.m. in the
Warner Center.

Carter will also speak to a group
of students Monday afternoon.

Associate Professor of Politics
Robert A. Strong said Carter asked to
speak to a small group in a personal
atmosphere because he enjoys close
contact with students.

Strong said Carter encourages stu-
dents to ask about topics ranging from
his presidency to peanut farming.

Carter served as president from
1977 to 1981. His foreign policy ac-
complishments included a peace treaty
between Egypt and Israel, the SALT II
treaty with the Soviet Union and estab-
lishment of diplomatic relations with
China.

On the domestic side, Carter’s
administration presided over deregu-
lation in energy, transportation, com-
munications, and finance and saw pas-
sage of environmental protection laws,
including the Alaska Lands Act.

After his term as president, Carter
became a professor at Emory Univer-
sity in Atlanta and founded The Carter
Center of Emory University, which
addresses national and international
policy issues.

Born in Plains in 1924, Carter

vote

could kill CRC

 

By LEIGH ALLEN
Phi News Editor

Students accused of sexual ha-
rassment will no longer face the Con-
fidential Review Committee if the fac-
ulty votes to kill the CRC May 4.

“The CRC is no longer a viable
option for student discipline at Wash-
ington and Lee,” said Dean of Stu-
dents David Howison.

The Student Affairs Committee
submitted a proposal to the faculty that
would create separate disciplinary sys-
tems for sexual assault and verbal ha-
rassment.

Howison said that SAC voted 9-1
on March 27 to recommend that the
faculty replace the CRC with a Stu-
dent-Faculty Hearing Board to hear
complaints of physical sexual assault.

If a student complains of verbal
harassment, Howison said that he will
appoint a mediator to attempt to re-
solve the complaint. If that fails, then
the student who complains has the
right to take the case the Student Con-
duct Committee.

Howison said that some faculty
members do not think that the SCC can
responsibly handle cases of harass-
ment.

However, SCC President Chris
Haley has confidence in the system.

“People have to give the SCC a
chance to prove that this will work,”
Haley said.

Howison said that confusion
among students about how the CRC
operated and the possibility of over-
lapping jursidiction between the CRC
and the SCC were major reasons for
SAC’s decision.

The faculty must approve the pro-
posal by a majority vote at the next
faculty meeting May 4.

In March, the CRC made public a
six-month self-evaluation that outlined
a plan for prosecuting students who
break a “Principle of Civility and De-
cency.”

According to the 46-page report,
students could be expelled for calling
someone ugly or using racist language.

The report said that W&L stu-
dents are not protected by the First
Amendmentrightto freedom of speech
because W&L is a private school rather
than a state university.

In an October 8 speech in Lee
Chapel, author Dinesh D’Souza said
that university speech codes similar to
the one adopted by the CRC infringe
on students’ freedom of speech and are
too vague to be effective.

A recent editorial in the Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch called the
CRC’s speech code one of the worst in
the nation.

Howison acknowledged that most
students did not support the CRC, but
said that this was because they were
confused as to how the CRC operates.

Howison said the Student-Faculty
Hearing Board will be composed of
four students and three faculty mem-
bers. The student members will be
chosen by the Excecutive Committee,
and the faculty by the Dean of the
College.

In other news related to SAC,
Howison said there are three new mem-
bers to the committee.

Panhellinic Council President
Carrie Eubanks will have a voting seat
on SAC starting this spring.

Professor DeMaria is leaving SAC
and will be replaced by Professors
Robert Ailius and Phillip Kline.

The extra faculty member is to
maintain the balance of faculty to stu-
dents on SAC, Howison said.

2.944 received credit for the five months he spent awaiting

2,902 good behavior, and served no jail time after the April

Judge George E. Honts III instructed the jurors
to deliberate again and take another vote or he would
be forced to call a mistrial. Ten minutes later, the
jurors emerged with what appeared to be a compro-
mise: one guilty verdict, one not guilty verdict.

Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Robert
Joyce acknowledged in his opening statement that
the case against Hudnall was purely circumstantial,
since no one saw Hudnall take the money and the
money was never found in Hudnall’s possession.
The prosecution relied mainly on three pieces of
evidence: a partially burned photograph with
Hudnall’s fingerprint on it, statements Hudnall made
saying “it was possible” that he had the missing
money, and a wad of money found in Hudnall’s
roommate’s boot

Hudnall’s defense attorneys, Anita Filson and
Thomas Simons, argued that the evidence did not
prove Hudnall’s guilt. They argued that Hudnall
could have left the fingerprint on the picture during
one of his earlier visits to Harvey’s room, and that
anyone could have hidden the money in Hudnall’s
dorm room, since rooms at VMI are left unlocked
Hudnall did not take the stand

Sneaking around

Our bronze Old George came back a sneak!
My God, the Hill won't even let us peek.

So let the alumni climb up to see

That behind such shrouds lies the CRC!!

The preceding poem was submitted to us anonymously
this week. Old George has returned to his perch. He came
back as he left, during Spring Break.

Some might be angry about his unexpected return.
Some might be confused about who the hooded figure is.
Some have even commented that he looks a little small
and that perhaps he’s been on a diet. But what’s certain is
that the trickery behind his return is just a symptom of a
larger problem at this university.

It just so happens that the reason the university chose
Spring Break for their statue raising was fairly logical —
they needed a time when they could close the Colonnade
for six hours, lest George fall and squash a student.

But why didn’t they tell us that in the first place? We
are not children. If they had told us their reasons, we
probably would have agreed. Instead, they made up
excuses for not putting him up during Mock Convention.
Their big excuse was ‘‘the crane that we use to lift him is
enormous and it would really tear up the front lawn to
raise him on a wet March day. Alumni Weekend would
be better.’ So, what did they do? They raised him on a
wet April day and destroyed the front lawn.

But the front lawn is not our main concern; we care
about administrators withholding the truth from students.
This subterfuge is not an isolated occurrence. Time and
again, the Hill says one thing and does another. Whether
it be the Watson Gallery, winter Rush, the car tax, the
CRC or Fraternity Renaissance, the Hill does not care
enough to deal straight with us. They would rather skirt
the truth. We deserve better.

Welcome back, George. Perhaps you can set them
straight.

No, not more of Homer Derrick’s home phone numbers.
Those are the new numbers to call if — OK, when — you
have a problem with the Phi.

Yes, Spring Break has come and gone, and the old Phi
staff has gone with it. Each year as we approach the end of
winter term, outgoing editors begin to count the days until
spring, and we, the incoming editors, realize that we won’t see
a Wednesday night party for at least another year.

The Phi will look pretty much .the same as it did
throughout the year. Still, we need to announce a couple of
policy changes. First, at Sigma Phi Epsilon’s request we’ll
refer to them as ‘‘Sig Ep’’ instead of ‘‘SPE.’’ We realize that
the old nickname is still used by many students, but fairness
dictates that we allow them to choose their own name.

Additionally, after they are released, EC and SCC decisions
will be listed — without names — below the General Notes on
page three. We just figure everyone will benefit from this
central, convenient notice.

And in the adventuresome spirit of spring term, next week
begins a trial advice column written by Dr. James Worth, the
university counseling psychologist. Feel free to send questions
(anonymously, of course,) to Dr. Worth at the Phi office.
Make them deathly serious, casual or anywhere in-between.

Again, remember that we like to call this the ‘‘student
newspaper of W&L.’’ So don’t hesitate to contact us — or
any of our colleagues in the staff box below. We can’t
promise we’ll be able to cure everything that ails you, but we
will listen and do our best to take your opinion into account.

Oh yeah. Some of you may have wondered about the
discreetly placed single-digit numerals that appeared in the ads
toward the end of winter term. The former editors were
counting the number of issues until their glorious departure.
Us? We’ve got 29 to go. TEE. CJL.

A sinner repents

 

My VIEW

By Peter T. Hansen VMI'87, W&L '92L

Your article about the Confidential Review
Committee concerned me. As a student of Wash-
ington and Lee, I strive to fulfill my duty to the
punctilio of honor. General Lee, who steered this
institution during troubled times, would exhort this
were he living. Alas, (and it is a personal wound) I
have failed to uphold the duties which fall upon the
members of this academy.

Please forgive the confessional nature of what
follows. Embarrassing though it is, I find no other
remedy than open honesty with my colleagues.
Although none will approve of the acts I will relate,
will not the readers accept this humble apology in
the spirit in which it is offered, and approve my
rededication to the lofty ideals we cherish?

I was dismayed that the CRC hold up as exem-
plary of a breach of social balance having sex with
someone whilst he is intoxicated (I extrapolate
“she” by logical inference, grammar, and egalitari-
anism). Being a student and a husband, I have
violated this more times than I can recite without
blushing in shame. I grieve the disorder I wrought,
but do not regret the proximate cause of my son’s
birth. Insofar as the event exceeded decent and civil
conduct however, I wish it had been otherwise; the
sacrifice of my family continuation is paltry com-
pared with the evil perpetrated by my perfidious
act. On second thought, perhaps I do regret my
son’s conception. Nor can I recall our matrimonial
celebrations without remorse. The entire wedding
led me inexorably away from righteous principles.

I naively thought conforming my marital be-

Phi reaches new
journalistic plateau

To Ms. Lopiccolo:

Have you been sleeping in your journalism
ethics class? Do you have any journalistic ethics?
How about if I sent this article to every major
newspaper, before you apply for a job? I’m sure
the Enquirer pays handsomely, or maybe you and
Jason Kelley can help Niall MacKenzie with his
upcoming masterpiece. Add a little bit of spice to
the plot, and a dash of sensationalism The Ring-
tum Phi style.

I realize that the recent rape trial is an impor-
tant issue on campus. And as the school newspa-
per it is your job to inform the W&L community
of recent developments. However, there is a line
between objective reporting and brutal insensitiv-
ity. You have notonly crossed it, you have reached
a new plateau in contemptible journalism. Any
merit this article might have contained is de-
stroyed once the complainant’s testimony is so
graphically described. It is not necessary to repeat
the intimate details of the crime with every new
development in the case. Don’t you realize that all
the women on this campus are vulnerable to rape?
As a potential victim, Ms Lopiccolo, do you not
realize how damaging and demoralizing the Phi’ s
coverage of this freshman’s experience has been?
Have you considered this girl’s feelings at all?

You have shown no consideration whatso-
ever for the two women mentioned in this article.
What exactly was the purpose of the passages

 

 
   

havior to the applicable laws of the Commonwealth
would be enough. Our native state had no such
prohibitions, and though abandoning the crimes
against nature (to use the parlance of the Virginia
Code) in which my wife and I indulged was a
sacrifice, I made it willingly, because the abstention
from carnal perversity is insignificant ‘compared
with the honor of being a law student. The CRC’s
added requirement has limited our conjugality to
the vanishing point, but as conforming to the laws
of the Old Dominion made me a better law student,
so conforming to the “Principles” will make me
better morally. What profits getting a J.D., or any
other degree, if we lose our souls in the process?

My initial trepidation has abated. I know who
the authors of this considered, noble document are,
and also know that professors here lead by ex-
ample, as Lee inculcated the honor system by first
living honorably himself. I am certain
the members of the CRC and faculty are already in
absolute harmony with the Principles of Civility
and Decency they wrote. (This would explain why
deans’ houses are so large; after all that famous
W&Lconviviality, they need domiciles large enough
for two master bedrooms, in order to avoid “the
near occasion of sin”.) I digress, I simply meant to
say that with a light heart and cheerful countenance
laffirm the circumscription of my marital relations,
and say “if they can, I can!”

Lastly, I draw resolve knowing W&L will
never abandon me without proper guidance. The
professors have been so vigilant over my ethical
welfare (dare I say, in this agnostic, cynical age, my
spirit?), I am convinced I will not even have to
request legal and psychiatric assistance when my
wife sues me for divorce, based on constructive
abandonment and infliction of emotional cruelty.

containing Hudnall’s justification for being in the
freshman dorm? The Phi has repeatedly men-
tioned his insinuations concerning Ms. Harvey.
Why was it necessary to quotethe unsubstantiated,
irrelevant hearsay (fifth paragraph, third column)?
All of the events leading to the trial have been
rehashed in order to squeeze every drop of sensa-
tionalism out of the story.

Have you forgotten that the entire W&L com-
munity reads this rag --- every professor, every
student, and every parent that receives an issue at
home? Clearly I do not expect every Phi article to
contain only the bare boned facts. Newspaper
articles should include some analysis and interpre-
tations for the reader. However, with this comes
the responsibility of treating your subjects, espe-
cially a W&L student who has been victimized,
with respect and sensitivity.

Phi article was
insensitive

To the Editor:

On March 12th, I picked up a copy of the Phi

university publication. However, instead of the
usual disappointment, I felt disbelief and disgust.
First of all, the fact that Mr. Hudnall managed to

Let IT RIDE

By Chris Swann

You can’t hide from it. You too get bored late
nights and turn on the television, hoping for some sort
of entertainment. And then you get sucked into Movie
Hell. You know what I’m talking about: after midnight
on HBO and Cinemax. These are the movies that would
make you want to nominate soaps for Oscars, movies
like “Howling VI: The Freaks” and “Big Busts.” To
save you from wasting your college years on bad
movies, I’ll give you a little taste of what to avoid.

Don’t ever see a movie that only has a few copies
in the largest movie rental store in your area. I saw
Flight of the Intruder over break, and it only had three
copies available ina 17,000-square-foot store. I should
have left it on the shelf to rot. Rosanna Arquette gets
perhaps ten minutes of

screentime, ten minutes  ‘ff’g Jike
too much.

Unless youareavery masturbating
violentperson, or wantto With a cheese
play the “let’s-drink- grater...’
everytime-somebody- __ Ford Fairlane

breaks-an-arm” game,
don’t rent Steven Seagal
or Jean-Claude Van Damme movies. If you want cult *
classics or a good laugh, rent really old martial arts .
movies with the awful sound effects and dubbing done
by a very slow and incompetent member of the Zulu
tribe who, by the way, speaks no English.

And then there’s the old standby, the cop-buddy
movies. This genre is more worn out than my first J.
Geils Band record. They have now taken it to sci-fi
territory, like 1] Come In Peace and Suburban Com-
mando. Rent a Dirty Harry flick and bag the rest.

Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors--while ~
not perhaps Academy award-winning material, his ,
James Bond is great. Just don’t watch anything he
made in the Seventies and Eighties beforeThe Un-
touchables.

Oh yeah--nothing starring a rock musician either,
beyond concept album films like The Wall” and Tommy.
This is like all those actors who want to sing, like Don
Johnson, for example (shudder). Like Ford Fairlane
said, “It’s like masturbating with a cheese grater--
mildly amusing, but ultimately painful.”

Science fiction movies without a multi-million
dollar budget aren’t worth the film they ruin. Without
special effects by somebody like Stephen Spielberg,
you’re wasting your time. I get turned off when I can
see the wire holding the spaceship in orbit over the
planet Zircon. Give me “Star Wars” or 2001 any day
over Moon 44 or Ice Pirates.

And now for some good movies...

Top Ten Movies Of All Time

10. Gone With the Wind. Ok, atear-jerker, but girls read
my column too (I think).

9, Animal House.

8. Dangerous Liaisons Talk about self-destructive
people. Best line: “What I’m trying to tell you, you
stupid little girl, is that you can do it as often as you like,
with as many people as you like, in as many ways as
you like.”

7. The Princess Bride. If you can watch this with
somebody who will not say every line along with the
characters, it’s hilarious. Best line: “Inconceivable!”
6. Casablanca. Bogie and the most gorveous woman
in Hollywood. ‘Nuff said.

5. The Searchers. John Wayne western that goes
beyond the stereotypical shoot-the-evil-Indians theme.
But you're probably too cool to watch a western, aren’t
you?

4. Raiders of the Lost Ark.. Kids in my neighborhood
were flaying their dogs and everybody else with
bullwhips for weeks.

3. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Clint Eastwood,
a half-million in gold, 4 bad guy named Angel Eyes,
and a vehemently nasty Mexican gentleman named
Tuco.

2.9 1/2 Weeks. Just kidding.

2. Wild Orchid. Sorry, my computer’s being per-
verted, possibly by my roommate.

2.(again) Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This is the
“drink-everytime-somebody-loses-a-kneecap” movie.
Gotta love Ahnold. Oh yeah, Linda Hamilton’s a babe.

1. StarWars trilogy. Adventure, romance, spaceships,
Wookies, annoying droids, Yoda, Darth Vader, Prin-
cess Leia in slinky clothing and Han Solo’s smirk.

wriggle through the judicial system was enough to
induce vomiting. Although, this is beyond the
control of the W&L community, we can prevent
our university paper from printing malicious hear-
say about one of our own.

Miss Lopiccolo, who wrote the feature on Mr.
Hudnall’s case, seems to have overlooked one
small detail. The supposed physical relationship
between Hudnall and dorm counselor Christin
Harvey is most certainly NOT the issue in this case.
Miss Lopiccolo, however, chose to repeatedly
mention the alleged relationship in her news ar-
ticle. What did Miss Lopiccolo hope to gain by
printing these accusations? I know sensationalism
sells a lot of newspapers, but perhaps someone
should remind Miss Lopiccolo that the Phi is free.

Miss Lopiccolo has displayed a lack of integ-
rity and sensitivity by printing these allegations
against Christen Harvey. I fail to see the reason for
involving Miss Harvey in anews feature regarding
the verdict in the Hudnall case. I also fail to see how
a university which thrives on the honor of its
students can allow a journalist like Miss Lopiccolo
to write for one of its publications.

Phi causes pain

To the Editor:

I was extremely disappointed to read the Phi’ s
sensational treatment of the recent rape case in-
volving a W&L freshman woman (Mar. 12, 1992
issue).

LETTERS continued from page 2

   

 

During this time in which many joumalists are
testing the bounds of ethical reporting, it seems
that a school newspaper with a small, defined
circulation would be extra careful with an issue as
sensitive as rape. However, the Phi succeeded in
humiliating the accuser, and probably scaring off
other women who would have considered coming
forward in the future. No woman wants to read the
accused’s account of her trauma in full detail on
the front page of a paper. Her name (thankfully)
was kept private for a reason. The details of her
ordeal ought to be kept private for the same reason.

In short, the article was simply irresponsible
and the names and details were unnecessary for
reporting the acquittal of Chad Hudnall. The Phi
Ought to remember in the future that what it reports
affects real people here on the W&L campus. It
should show some respect fora courageous woman
instead of causing her more pain.

Shelby Kerr, '95

Journalists make
difficult decisions

To the Editor:

As members of the faculty of the department
of Journalism and Mass Communications, we
wish to express our support of the staff of The
Ring-tum Phi.

We do so not necessarily because we agree
with every decision made by every reporter and
editor, but because the staff’s guiding philosophy
is clearly appropriate. The editorial in the March
19 issue is an eloquent statement of the principles
that should guide journalists. We believe the re-
porters and editors strive mightily to uphold those
principles, nearly always with complete success.

As a journalist, each of us has made decisions
that have caused deep distress and harsh criticism.
Thankfully, in most cases we were correct. Sadly,
in some case we erred. But it was absolutely
necessary for us, rather than some governmental
tribunal or arbiter of social graces, to have made
those decisions.

A press that is free from instant governmental
or social control is a requisite of a free society. We
must never forget that fact, especially when the
press’ mirror indicates all is not ideal in our world.
As the Phi editorial noted, the events reported on
did in fact occur; not chronicling those events
performs little service and has the potential for
great harm.

No one is more conscious of the audience’s
response than the people who regularly put their
work before an audience. No one knows better
., that a story can harm people and institutions,
regardless of how sensitively a’story is written or
displayed. No one is more aware of the compelling
good and evil a story may cause. for that reason, it
is usually incorrect to assume that thoughtlessness
or wrongheadedness is the cause of a story being
handled in a way we dislike. We can disagree with
how a story is playede== and if we do, we should
let our opinions be known. But it is equally impor-
tant torecognize that a state-controlled press serves
the state, not the public. In other words, the issue
is not protection of the public but control informa-
tion.

The university is in the process of considering
achange in the mission of the Confidential Review
Committee. At question is whether harassing
speech should be subject to censure, including
expulsion. Those of us who are uncomfortable
with restricting speech must likewise be discom-
fited with proposals to impose student-govern-
ment oversight over the stories in The Ring-tum
Phi. Those of us comfortable with student-gov-
ernment control of the Phi must wonder whether

control of the Phi by Washington Hall would be
equally praiseworthy.

Sexual assault will not go away if it is not
reported. Financial mismanagement will not cease
if it is not reported. Tuition increases will not stop
if they are not reported. Parking spaces will not
become available if their absence is no longer
reported. Athletic teams will not become confer-
ence champions overnight if their losses are not
reported. Watson Galleries will be built regardless
of whether opposition to them goes unreported,

Let us freely, openly <= and vehemently, if
we wish — discuss the Phi’ s news coverage. Let
us be critical of the Phi editorials and write out-
raged letters to the editor if we disagree with them.
But let us also remember that in totalitarian states
the press is controlled as an organ of government
and that in democratic societies the press is free so
it may serve the public.

It is our belief that an untrammeled Ring-tum
Phi, by trusting its readers with information, serves
them far better than would a Phi controlled by a
handful of Executive Committee officers.

W&L students
have earned trust

To the Editor:

I read with dismay a recent account in the
Richmond newspapers of the Confidential Re-
view Committee’s recommendation that the First
Amendment rights be trampled in the name of
“civility” and “decency,” PC buzzwords as dan-
gerous to a serious institution of higher learning as
they are reprehensible. The reports of the proposal
only serve to make the panel, and the administra-
tion that sanctions it, look foolish as well as grossly
irresponsible.

When did the honor system fail to be ad-
equate? Why does the administration feel it’s
necessary to protect the gentle sensitivities of the
certain students at the expense of the freedom of
expression, and the University’s good name? Are
students now so incapable of policing themselves
in the realm of proper conduct and serious deco-
rum that the administration is stepping forward in
an Orwellian fashion to promote its obvious goal
of diversity, victims studies, and hypersensitivity?
I give W&L students more credit than that, ‘but
hope itis not wishful thinking.

All students should be insulted by this far-
left, “thought police” type of tampering with basic
rights, and the open world of free expression
WA&L once was.

MayorH.E. Derrick
defends car tax

To the Editor:

Your editorial in the February 27 issue of the
Phi has been brought to my attention. Unfortu-
nately I was not in town at the time, so those who

  

tried to call me only got my answering machine.
Surprisingly, there was only one message left, and
that one not very effective.

I suppose that whenever tax tickets go out this
issue will be revisited. No one actually likes to pay
taxes and a negative reaction is almost inevitable.
But I would like to refer you to the enclosed
“Personal Property White Paper” which was sent
to your publication last year. While it was pre-
sented in response to a proposed boycott of down-
town businesses, the basic facts remain the same.

The whole issue of taxes and revenues neces-
sary to support the services provided our commu-
nity are of course far too complex to cover in a
single page summary and I would invite the editors
of the Phi to meet with me to discuss the personal
property tax in particular, and the city’s finances in
general. I would appreciate the opportunity to give
you the whole picture, rather than have you edito-
rialize from a very narrow perspective.

Incidentally, I work very long hours six days
a week, so I’m notat that home number very much.

Imaginary car was
real at some point

To the Editor:

In response to Heather Olsen’s letter and her
tale of the “imaginary car,” there are several facts
that should be presented. There is a“‘REAL CAR.”
This genuine vehicle was assessed to her father
who is the registered owner. Contrary to the state-
ment in the letter, we know the license plate num-
ber and the tax assessment was based on the make
model, and identification number of this vehicle.
Miss Olsen might not keep this vehicle in Lexing-
ton but it was here at some point or we would not
have had this information. Our abilities in this
office do not extend to imagining the exact license
number, registration and other information spe-
cific to this auto.

Virginia law states that vehicles should be
assessed for taxation where they are usually ga-
raged. It has been ruled that vehicles operated by
students during the school year become part of the
property of the jurisdiction where they are attend-
ing school. The law requires taxpayers to report
property subject to the local tax commissioner and
provides for a penalty when it is not reported.
Finally the law vbligates the tax commissioner to
assess the property, based upon the best informa-
tion he can obtain, when it is not reported. There is
no reference to an exception or exemption for
vehicles operated by students.

I don’t claim that errors are not made in the
assessment office. We do make mistakes but when
they are called to our attention, we correct them.
Obviously, in the area of vehicle assessment, more
errors are made when property is not reported. In
this particular case, Mr. Olsen notified us that his
vehicle was not garaged in Lexington and his tax
bill was abated.

Most will agree that there are enough real
vehicles in Lexington to make it unnecessary to
assess imaginary ones. Since I am obligated to
assess property in Lexington, and since most stu-
dents do not report the vehicles that they have at
school, perhaps Heather Olsen can offer sugges-
tion for a more efficient strategy to complete this
assignment. I am very open to new and better
ideas.

Lexington Commissioner of Revenue

Music festival comes to W&L

 

DaviID WILMINGTON
Phi Staff Reporter

On May 3 and 4, Washington and
Lee will again host some of America’s
finest composers and instrumentalists.

The Sonoklect New Music Festi-
val enters its third year with concerts in
the Lenfest Center featuring music by
Nicholas Maw, Margaret Brouwer,
Gary Lee Nelson, and Pulitzer Prize -
winner Stephen Albert.

Assistant Professor of Music Mar-
garet Brouwer created the festival.
According to her, it provides opportu-
nities for the public to attend lectures
and panel discussions staffed by com-
posers and performers.

Brouwer said the purpose of
Sonoklect is “to provide W&L stu-
dents and the Lexington community
with exposure to New Music per-

formed by fine musicians”.

Although most people assume that
contemporary music is dissonant, the
works being performed at this year’s
festival show that composers have not
abandoned the tonal traditions of clas-
sical music.

Nicholas Maw’s “Ghost Dances”
shows great respect for tradition while
utilizing native African, Pakistani, and
American instruments to create unique,
expressive music.

Stephen Albert’s “To Wake the
Dead” uses thoroughly tonal harmo-
nies to portray the dream-like text of
James Joyce’s Finnegan's Wake.
Brouwer’s “Skydiving” is a piece for
flute, violin, cello, and piano that main-
tains a consonant sound while using
atonal harmonies.

The performing ensemble for this
year is the nationally reknowned 20th

Century Consort from Washington
De.

The group is the resident ensemble
at the Smithsonian Institution’s
Hirshorn Museum and includes prin-
cipal players from the National Sym-
phony Orchestra as well as chamber
musicians from Washington D.C. and
New York.

The Artistic Director and Con-
ductor of the Consort is Christopher
Kendall - Associate Conductor of the
Seattle Symphony Orchestra, founder
of the Folger Consort, and guest con-
ductor with the San Francisco Cham-
ber Symphony and the Chamber Mu-
sic Society of Lincoln Center.

In past years, students from other
universities have entered their own
compositions in a contest sponsored
by Brouwer.

The winners’ pieces are performed
by the professional Sonoklect en-
semble. This year, however, the 20th
Century Consort will be making a pri-
vate recording of two Washington and
Lee students’ works.

“The Consort is a very famous
ensemble. Most composers would kill
to get arecording done by them. These
students should feel very lucky to have
this opportunity," Brouwer said.

The second Sonoklect concert will
be a concert/lecture on May 18 by
Oberlin College Conservatory’s Pro-
fessor of Electronic and Computer
Music Gary Lee Nelson.

Nelson will make use of synthe-
sizers and various computer generated
sounds as well as a new invention
called the MIDI horn.

The MIDI horn is similar to the
traditional horn as far as the sound it
makes and the way it is used by the
musician. However, the MIDI horn is
totally computerized. The musician, in
essence, is the programmer of the MIDI
horn.

On May 20, the math and music
departments will be attending a work-
shop/demonstration called “Math-
ematical Models for Musical Compo-
sition,”

This presentation will involve the
use of fractals and probability in music
and is open to the general public.

Student rubs elbows with stars

Freshman works on set of Jodie Foster/Richard Gere movie

 

By NICOLE KEELER
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Freshman Chris Albert’s Spring Term Internship has
him working an exhausting 18-hour day. But Albert says
he wouldn’t want it any other way.

Albert is the location intern on the Richard Gere/Jodie
Foster movie Sommersby which is being filmed at the
Warwickton mansion in Bath County’s Hidden Valley.

According to Albert, Sommersby is post-Civil War
love story about a Confederate soldier (Gere) who returns
to his Southern plantation to be reunited with his wife
(Foster) and children.

As location intern, Albert works under the direction of
Locations Manager Scott Elias and On Set Manager Anna
Craven.

Elias has worked on the TV show In the Heat of the
Night and the current box office flick, My Cousin Vinny.
Craven worked on In the Heat of the Night and several
episodes of Miami Vice.

“ They're really cool and great people, I love working
for them,” Albert said.

As locations intern, Albert sees that things run smoothly
on the set.

According to Albert, due to the unique location of the
movie (in George Washington National Forest) his job is to
ensure that production goes well.

“We also work with the family that lives in the
Warwickton Mansion to see that they are not inordinately
inconvenienced, and with the National Park Service,” he

‘ 464-6666

 

said.

Albert’s duties include: setting up catering services,
guarding the set from unauthorized press members, and
other general tasks

“The other day I had to stake off sections of the lawn
because people were driving over it, and the director was
getting angry,” Albert said.

Albert says he’s met both of the stars, but only briefly.

“T was introduced to Richard Gere the other day, but
that morning ithad taken four hours to filma ninety second
scene,” he said. “He had had to repeat the same lines over
and over again, he was exhausted.”

According to Albert, the multitude of camera angles
makes a few seconds of film a full day’s work.

Albert says an entire period town, complete with
doctor’s office, general store, corral and mill, was built
specifically for Sommersby. The set designer is Bruno
Rubeo, who has worked on Driving Miss Daisy, Albert
said.

Albert says he was impressed by all aspects of the
film’s production. “The costumes are fantastic and our
sound mixer (Christopher Newman) was just nominated
for an Oscar for his work on Silence of the Lambs,” Albert
said.

Despite the long, hard hours Albert says the time
spent on the set has been great.

“It’s an incredible experience. I’m learning a lot
about the movie business and movie making, I’m on the
crew sheets and really feel part of the team,” Albert said.
“Basically, I’m having an awesome time.”

Voting conflict

taken to

By THOMAS EISENHAUER
Phi Executive Editor

 

 

A Washington and Lee law
student is going to court in his quest
to register to vote in Lexington, but
the city registrar has told two under-
graduates that she will allow them to
register.

First-year law student Chris
Kowalczuk has appealed to Chief
Judge Rudolph Bumgardner of the
25th Circuit Court to overturn Lex-
ington Registrar Lucille Joyce’s refus-
al of his voter registration application.
Normally, Judge George E. Honts III
hears such appeals, but he withdrew
from the case after Kowalczuk pro-
tested that Honts had conferred with
Joyce before her original refusal.
Kowalczuk’s trial is set for next
Thursday.

Last month, Joyce refused to
register Kowalczuk and sophomores
Matt Jackson and Ryan Dennard,
saying that they did not qualify as
Lexington residents because they
have only nine-month apartment leas-
es. Dennard appealed to Honts, who
upheld Joyce’s decision.

According to the Virginia Con-
stitution, citizens can vote only in
their places of residence, which in-
cludes ‘‘both domicile and place of
abode.”’

One week later Joyce reversed

court

her earlier position and told Jackson
and Dennard that she will allow them
to register. Jackson said that Joyce
changed her mind after he wrote her
a letter stating his intent to make
Lexington his place of residency.

The Code of Virginia says do-
micile may be determined by ‘‘intent,
conduct and all attendant circumstanc-
es,’’ such as financial independence,
leasehold and sites of personal and
real property.

However, Kowalczuk said Joyce
didn’t believe him when he stated his
intent. He said he has not lived in his
native Ohio since 1987.

“It’s a little bit of a mystery to
me why she refused my application,”’
Kowalczuk said. “‘She seemed more
hung up on our previous conversa-
tion.”’

If he loses this case, Kowalczuk
said, he will appeal to the Virginia
Supreme Court, the subsequent appel-
late court for voter registration cases.

The problem facing students
attempting to register, Jackson said, is
that the statute is so ambiguous that
each registrar must define residency
for himself.

“We're working with Mrs.
Joyce on this,’’ he said. ‘‘In the long
run we hope to establish a mutual
understanding so that other students
will understand how to register to
vote in Lexington.”’

Alumni Weekend Already?

A custodian polishes Old George one last time before he is lifted
to his pedestal above Washington Hall April 13. Earlier this year,
the university said Old George would be placed back on his
perch Alumni Weekend. The statue, which was removed for

repairs two years ago, returns

a new man, literally. The statue

 

that stands shrouded on the cupola pending a rededication next
month is actually a bronze replica of the original wooden statue
carved 150 years ago by Mathew Kahle. The original statue, fully
restored by Alabama sculptor Branko Medenica, is on display in
the University Library's Boatwright Room.

Law School Dean Randall Bezanson offers a
champagne toast to former Supreme Court

Photo by Claudia Schwab, The News-Gazerte
Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. at the opening of
the Powell Collection earlier this month.

Powell honored at dedication

 

By JOSHUA MANNING
Phi Managing Editor

On a snowy Saturday morning three weeks ago,
U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist
rose to deliver the keynote address at a law forum in
the Lenfest Center. But all eyes seemed to be on the
guest of honor, former Justice and W&L alumus Lewis
F, Powell Jr.

The forum, discussing contemporary challenges to
judging, was part of a symposium held to mark the
dedication of the Powell Collection annex to Lewis
Hall.

Powell, who served on the Supreme Court for 15
years, donated the archives of his distinguished 55-year
legal career in 1990.

‘Powell recognized that judging was not just a
process, but a deliberative process,’’ Rehnquist said.
“*He wrote more than his share of opinions, but never
lost sight of the fact that the court should function as a
body.”’

In his speech, Rehnquist attacked the common
belief that judges make up their minds before hearing
a case.

‘Judges read, listen and discuss — then they
form an opinion and vote,’’ Rehnquist said. ‘*And
votes are not always the same as their original indica-

tions; they change throughout the process.”’

Above all, courts need to give clear legal opin-
ions, unaffected by outside political pressures, Rehn-
quist said, and Powell understood this better than most.

Another panelist, U.S. Court of Appeals Justice J.
Harvie Wilkinson, served as Powell’s assistant in the
early ’70s.

He said Powell’s greatest virtue was to resist the
trivialization and polarization of the judicial process. In
this way Powell worked to overcome one of the
greatest challenges to judging today, Wilkinson said.

‘*Powell wanted to ease rather than exacerbate
conflicts on the bench,’’ Wilkinson said. ‘‘He had the
nicest way of telling you that you’re wrong.”’

Wilkinson said Powell called on lawyers and
judges to seek common ground and find solutions
rather than vie for dominance.

Powell, who sat quietly but smiling in the fourth
row of the Keller Auditorium during the forum, re-
ceived a standing ovation at the podium during the
formal dedication of the Powell Collection that after-
noon.

‘*T’ve witnessed and happily taken part in some
of the vast changes that have taken place in this great
country,’’ Powell said. ‘‘Standing here today, I have
more feeling, appreciation and affection than I can
possibly express.”

ABC ups patrols at Goshen

 

By KATIE YDEL
Phi Staff Reporter

 

State officials have a warning
for students who want to drink while
visiting Goshen or Panther Falls this
spring: Don’t do it unless you’re pre-
pared to get caught.

National Forest Service official
Jack Bowen said that Alcohol Bever-
age Control and NFS officers will
target students drinking and camping
illegally at the popular spots.

‘Many young people don’t
know how to behave themselves,”’
Bowen said.

Bowen said that in the past
there have been many incidents at
these areas involving students from
Washington and Lee and nearby col-
leges,

ABC agent R.D. Stevens said
the Board will work with the Forest
Service and the Sheriff’s office to try
to keep these areas alcohol-free.

Stevens said that although this
action is not aimed solely at students,
they have been a big part of the prob-
lem in the past.

Panther Falls, in the National
Forest, is located near Lynchburg on
the Pedlar River. Although alcohol is
allowed in most of the National For-
est for those over 21, it is not permit-
ted in the Panther Falls area under
any circumstances.

According to Bowen, this regu-
lation was made about two years ago

Alcohol and Goshen will not be companions this spring. Officials are
cracking down on alcohol consumption in the area in order to
promote a family atmosphere and reduce accidents.

by the Forest Supervisor. Bowen said
the area was notorious for being a
party place.

“*We’re trying to make it a
decent place for a person to go and
take their family,’’ Bowen said.

There have also been several
accidental deaths in the area.

Last summer Larkin Smith, a
James Madison University student,
dove into the river at Panther Falls
and hit her head on a rock. She broke
her neck on impact and died four
days later.

Although Smith’s death was not

a result of drinking, Bowen said that
there have been alcohol related deaths
in the past.

There is also a regulation at
Panther Falls prohibiting camping
within 150 feet of the water. The
regulation was enacted to prevent
campers from accidentally polluting
the river, which provides drinking
water for the city of Lynchburg.

People caught drinking beer at
Goshen or Panther Falls can be cited
for either minor in possession or
drinking in public. Those caught
camping too close can be fined.

Fraternities can no_ longer
sponsor summer parties to rush
incoming freshmen.

At its March 31 meeting, the
Interfraternity Council voted 11-3 to
abolish house-sponsored summer rush
parties, but said open contact rules
are still in effect during the summer.

IFC President Greg Hicks also
said fraternities will still receive the
names and addresses of incoming
freshmen and can send rush material
during the summer.

Hicks told IFC members he
thought the university would probably
have stopped giving freshmen
addresses to houses if summer parties
were not abolished.

Associate Dean of Students for
Greek Affairs Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins
said that although sun:mer rush
parties were unpopular arnong the
faculty, there was never a threat of
not giving the freshman lists to
fraternities.

‘*The faculty would rather that
a freshman’s first W&L experience
would have been coming to
Lexington and meeting with
professors, not going to fraternity
parties in the summer,’’ Atkins said.
‘*But there was never any threat of
blackmail.”

Atkins said he believed the IFC
abolished the parties because ‘‘it
wasn’t a manageable _ situation.
There’s no way to exercise any kind
of jurisdiction.”’

Burke finally wins in
second run-off election

 

By FRANCESCA KEFALAS
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Richard Burke won the election
for senior class president March 30
after finishing in a tie with Betsy
Kleiner in the first run-off on March
26.

Less than half as many votes
were cast in the first run-off, which
ended in a 123-123 tie, as in, the
initial election. The Voting Regula-
tions Board then scheduled a second
run-off for March 30, the Monday
after Fancy Dress.

Burke, who was elected class
president for the fourth time, received
121 votes to Kleiner’s 108.

According to VRB Chairman
Ward Maedgen, the ballots from the
first run-off were counted at least four
times to ensure that there was a tie.

““Once we realized there was a
tie, we knew there had to be another
run-off,’’ Maedgen said.

Maedgen said he then told Ex-
ecutive Committee President Giles
Perkins about the tie and that Perkins
agreed that there should be another
run-off.

Burke said he was dissatisfied
with the process as a whole.

“IT was amazed they held the
elections near Fancy Dress week-
end,”’ Burke said. ‘‘The timing of
both votes was bad. It wasn’t fair to

Betsy or myself.”’

Neither candidate campaigned
before the second run-off and Burke
and Kleiner both believe that most
people didn’t know about the run-
offs.

‘*A lot of my fraternity brothers
didn’t vote on Thursday (the first run-
off) because they didn’t know there
was a run-off,”’ said Burke.

Kleiner
onic i226
thought the
entire situation
with the run-
offs was unusu-
al, but com-
mended the
VRB’s efforts.

fF he
longer you drag
things out the
less interested Burke
people are,’’ Kleiner said. ‘‘I think
the VRB did a really good job with a
weird situation.”’

Burke, however, was more dis-
satisfied with the process and the
timing.

Burke said he was satisfied with
the results of the election but was
concerned by his slim margin of vic-
tory.

 

 

 

 

 

‘Betsy did really well,’’ he
said. ‘‘I wish people who are dissatis-
fied would come and talk to me.”’

Golf continues roll

 

By JAY PLOTKIN
Phi Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee golf
team continued its roll through the
regular season in impressive fashion
last week, winning a dual match and
two tournaments.

The win achieved a milestone
for their long-time coach and
increased the team’s chances for a
third straight trip to the NCAA
Championship meet.

The Generals beat Shenandoah
by over 70 strokes and then won the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference-
Virginia Wesleyan Invitational and
the Shipbuilder’s Invitational, both by
convincing margins.

Senior Clay Thomas was the
medalist in each of the three meets,
shooting a 73 against Shenandoah and
in the Shipbuilder’s Invitational, and
a 72 in the ODAC-VWC meet.
Thomas has shot six straight rounds
of 77 or better, and has not shot
higher than 73 in his last four
Outings.

“Clay is playing well,’’ coach
Buck Leslie said. ‘‘He was in a
slump at the beginning of the season,
but he has worked his way out of it
pretty well. In fact, this is the best

streak Clay’s had since he’s been
here."’

Fellow senior Jay McKnight
has also been playing well. McKnight
has shot seven straight sub-80 rounds
to help carry the load.

The Generals got a pleasant
surprise over break when Scott
Thompson shot back-to-back 78s
against Shenandoah and at VWC.

‘‘We moved Scott up to the
sixth spot and he contributed right
away,” said Leslie. ‘‘He picked up
our bad rounds. That helps, because
early we weren’t picking them up.
But Scott has taken care of that in the
last few meets.”’

The victory at the ODAC-
VWC meet gave Leslie his 200th
career win. He now has a career
record of 220-31-2.

‘[Getting 200 wins] is
gratifying to say the least,’’ the 18-
year Generals’ coach said.

Leslie was also happy that his
Generals improved their national
standing.

‘*We moved up to third in the
district, behind Methodist and
Greensboro, and we’ve kept our
national ranking at 14th,’’ he said.
‘*We’re in a position where we think
the NCAA will give us a long look.’’

Women’s tennis hitting
Stride for ODAC tourney

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE
Phi Sports Editor

The Washington and Lee wo-
men’s tennis team is on fire!

The team completed another
undefeated week and upped their
overall record to 13-3. The Generals
are currently on a 10-match winning
streak. The 10th win came over
ODAC rival Guilford last Friday. The
win secured the ODAC regular season
title for the team.

The team started last week by
beating Armstrong State 5-4. They
then took on Cabrini and just blew
them off the courts, 9-0. Their third
victim was Guilford, 5-4.

The third doubles team of soph-
omore Kim Dickinson and freshman

Liz McCord went 3-0 on the week
and secured the victory over Guilford
with a hard-fought 5-7, 7-5, 6-2 win.
Freshman Cathy Gartin also
finished the week undefeated at sixth
singles, upping her record to 9-1.
Another freshman is leading the
Generals this year. Marilyn Baker is
17-2 in matches this year, and 14-1 in
dual meets. She lost her first dual
match of the year against Armstrong.

The Generals travel to Ran-
dolph-Macon Women’s College this
weekend for the ODAC tournament.
They enter the contest with a team
that has three sophomores and three
freshmen. But with the way the team
is playing, youth, or inexperience,
should play no part in the outcome.

Men’s team survives road trip

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE
Phi Sports Editor

While most of us were
soaking up rays and sipping
margaritas, the Washington and
Lee men’s tennis team was
enduring a long five-day road
trip.

In those five short days
they played three Division I
schools, last year’s Division II
champs, and one of the top
NAIA schools in the nation.
Makes you glad you were
tanning, right?

April 13: The Generals
take on the University of
Central Florida, Division I. They
lose 5-4. Robby MacNaughton
wins at second singles and the
Generals take all three doubles,
including a thriller at third
doubles. Wes Ruggles and Kelly
Vandever tum in a_ gutsy
performance, winning 5-7, 6-3,
7-6(7-4).

April 14: W&L travels to
Division I Stetson and walks
away with a 5-4 victory.
Richard Yates wins at first
singles, MacNaughton at
second, David Schweppe at fifth
and Vandever at sixth. Vandever
turns around and teams up with
Ruggles to take the deciding
third doubles match.

April 15: The Generals
earn more frequent flyer mileage
as they take a trip to Rollins,
last season’s Division II national
champions. The Generals are
handled easily, 8-1. The
highlight of the match was
impressive play of the third
doubles team of Ruggles and
Vandever, as they take the only
match for W&L.

April 16: The Generals
visit Division I Jacksonville
University. The road-warriors
end up on the short end of a 7-1
final. But the team of Ruggles
and Vandever continue to
impress. They rack up their
fourth consecutive win at third
doubles.

 

 

 

Senior Richard Yates, seen above serving
Rolex Invitational, won the first singles match at

April 17: Even on Good
Friday the Generals can’t
catch a break. They make their
final stop at North Florida, a
NAIA powerhouse. The
Generals are handed their third
straight defeat, 8-1. This time
it’s singles that supplies the
victory. Yates finishes his trip
with a 6-2, 7-6(7-2) win.

With this, the Generals are

finally able to go home.

In the

“You get much
reenforcement playing such
tough competition,’’ said head
coach Gary Franke. ‘‘We got
some great performances, third

we’re ready for the ODACs,
though.”’

That’s next up for the
Generals. They are the heavy

a strong showing to help them
make the Division III national
tournament.

“‘How well we do in the
ODACs and against Swarthmore
will determine if we make it,’’

said Franke. ‘‘We lost to
Wooster this year so the
Swarthmore match is very
critical.’’

For one it was the grand
finale.
For the other it was the first

| trip to the big show.

The end of the Washington
and Lee men’s swimming season
came with the Division III Nationals
meet four weeks ago. What makes it
newsworthy a month later is the fact

.| that the Generals were represented by

their two top swimmers this year.

Senior Doug Brown and
freshman John Rowe competed in a
combined five events at the meet in
Buffalo, New York. For Brown, the
meet marked the end of a brilliant
career. In stark contrast, the meet
marked the beginning of what could
be a brilliant career for Rowe.

You’d expect the veteran to be
calm, cool and collected, while the
rookie did the nervous pacing. It was
the exact opposite.

**T was nervous as hell,”’ said
Brown. ‘‘I was concerned about how
well I was going to do, and this was

“I was excited,’’ said Rowe.
‘Tl didn’t know what to expect with
this being my first time.’’

Brown competed in the 500-
yard and 1,650-yard freestyle events.
Unfortunately, he fell less than a
second short of his goal of all-
America status in both events. He
finished 18th in the 1,650-yard and
19th in the 500-yard; 16th place was

after the race,’’ said Brown. ‘‘It was

moved up from my pre-race seeds,

The Washington and Lee
women’s lacrosse team righted their
ship Wednesday with a convincing
17-6 victory over Hollins.

The victory came at just the
right time for the Generals. After two
tough one-goal losses, the team
needed a confidence booster before
the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference tournament.

The team was voted 12th in the
nation just prior to a three-game road
trip in Pennsylvania. The Generals
dropped two of the three games.

They opened with an impressive
victory over Gettysburg, 12-6. But
they went on to lose two
heartbreakers.

The first was a 8-7 loss to
Division II power Lock Haven. The

After a frustrating loss to a
nationally-ranked rival, the
Washington and Lee men’s lacrosse
team rebounded with a convincing
15-6 win over Limestone yesterday.

The Generals dominated the
Saints in every statistical category,
getting three goals from junior David
Lefkowitz and two each from seniors
Jeff Roberts and Drew Anton, junior
Wiemi Douoguih, sophomore Colin
Higgins and freshman Andy Dutton.

W&L outshot Limestone 49-
16, picked up 77 ground balls to
Limestone’s 35, won 18 of 24
faceoffs and forced Limestone into 22
failed clears in 38 attempts.

The effort came after head
coach Jim Stagnitta turned up the
intensity level in practice after eighth-
ranked Washington College scored
the last six goals of the game to down
the Generals 16-10 on Saturday.

““We played poorly Saturday,’’
Stagnitta said, ‘‘so we got after the
players a bit in practice, and they
responded.’

The Generals led 8-1 at the
half against Limestone, but the Saints
scored five third-quarter goals to get
back in the game at 9-6 at the end of
three quarters. Lefkowitz answered
with two straight goals, and the
Generals ran off the last six goals of
the game.

““We didn’t shoot well, and
that kept the game close,” said
Stagnitta. ‘‘We banged them around
pretty well and did what we wanted
10."

Limestone goalie Brian Shaver
made 21 saves to keep the Saints
close.

Against Washington College,
the Generals jumped out to a 3-1 lead
before the Shoremen took a 9-6 lead
in third quarter. W&L rallied behind

second was another one-goal loss to
Haverford, 9-8. The two losses
dropped the Generals to 9-3 on the
season.

In the victory over Hollins
yesterday, the Generals were led by a
freshman and a_ senior. Senior
Kimberly Bishop and freshman
Nicole Ripken each scored four goals
to pace the Generals. Bishop now has
39 on the season and Ripken has 17.
Bishop is four goals away from
breaking her own school record for
goals in a single season.

The Generals enter the ODAC
tournament with a record of 10-3.
They are seeded No. 2 and received a
bye in the first round. Their first
game will be a second round contest
against the winner of the
Bridgewater-Sweet Briar game. The
game will be played at Liberty Field
on Saturday at 12:30 p.m.

said Stagnitta. ‘‘We’re lucky we had
guys like Josh Levinson, Dave
Schiminger and Jeff Roberts to keep
us in the game. They out-hustled and
out-played us and just wanted it more
than we did. It was 10-10 late in the
third quarter and we weren't playing
well.”’

“On the film, it looked like
we didn’t try,’’ said Roberts. ‘‘That
hurt more than losing the game.”’

Roberts, Schiminger and
Douoguih each scored twice for the
Generals, and senior Coleman Devlin
made 17 saves.

The loss to WC was W&L’s
fifth of the season, all to ranked
teams. It also dropped the Generals to
16th in Division III.

Roberts’ second goal gave him
50 points on the season, making him
only the fifth player in school history
to record back-to-back 50 point
seasons. Roberts has 55 points (31
goals and 24 assists) on the season.

While Roberts has been
consistent all year, the Generals have
gotten strong performances recently
from Lefkowitz and junior Derek
Hutton, a face-off and defensive
specialist.

“Lefkowitz is starting to
realize that he can’t run with the ball,
that he has to be an off-the-ball
player,’’ said Stagnitta, ‘‘and he’s
Starting to stick it in the net.’’

Lefkowitz has four goals in
the last two games and has 13 goals
on the season. Hutton has 18 ground
balls in the last two games and won
five of the seven faceoffs he took
against Limestone.

“‘Hutton, along’ with
[freshman] Ty Powers, is starting to
come around,”’ said Stagnitta. ‘‘He’s
had a couple of great games in a row,
and he’s one of the few players who
played hard the full 60 minutes
against Washington.”’

It has been a baptism of fire for
the young Washington and Lee
baseball team.

Despite facing the best teams in
the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference and the nation day-in-and-
day-out, the Generals have played
every game as hard as possible.

Over break the Generals faced
three of the top ODAC teams and
another tough opponent in the form of
St. Mary’s (Md.). Again the Generals
gave it their best, but could only
manage to salvage a 1-6 record.

“‘We’re hanging in there,’’ said
head coach Jeff Stickley. ‘‘I can see
us getting better with each game. A
win always helps that, but the guys
are in a good frame of mind.”’

The Generals began their break
with a doubleheader against ODAC
power Guilford. The Generals led in
both games but couldn’t hold them
and they lost both, 8-4, 10-8.

“‘We had a chance to win both
those games,”’ said Stickley. ‘‘We
just couldn’t hold it at the end.’’

The Generals got to take on one
of the top two teams in the ODAC
next. Lynchburg paid a visit to Smith
Field and left with 15-3 win. Howev-
er, the score is somewhat misleading.
At the end of five innings the Gener-
als were only down 5-3. But Lynch-
burg exploded for two in the sixth,
four in the seventh and four in the
eighth to round out their scoring.

 

_ | Even with the collapse in the late

innings, the Generals looked good.

W&L then traveled to Eastern
Mennonite College for another dou-
bleheader. EMC dominated the open-
er winning 5-1. But the second game
typified the Generals season.

At the end of four innings, the
Generals only trailed 7-4 and they
looked like they were going to make
this one count. But they ran out of

gas at the end, being shutout the last
three innings and giving up a final
three runs in the bottom of the fifth.
They lost 10-4.

Generals fans were able to cheer
a victory against St. Mary’s (Md.).
The Generals took the opening game
of their third doubleheader in four
games, 2-1. Toby McCoy pitched a
complete game allowing only one run
on three hits. Duane Van Arsdale and
Brian Harper drove in the two runs as
the Generals snapped an 11-game
losing streak.

However, St. Mary’s came back
and took the night cap 9-8. The Gen-
erals made a furious comeback in the
last two innings but fell one run short.

The loss dropped the Generals
to 4-17-0, 1-110 in the ODAC. De-
spite the record, Stickley sees his
team improving.

““We were in every game last
week. The young players are getting
more experience and they’re getting
better. As long as we keep improving
and giving ourselves chances to win,
we'll be alright.”

The Generals challenged Lynch-
burg again yesterday and it was under
some extraordinary circumstances.

Starting pitcher TJ. Daly was
involved in the accident on Interstate
64. After his accident he helped pull
people from cars until rescuers ar-
rived.

Whether it matters or not, the
Generals lost to Lynchburg 5-1. Daly
pitched seven innings allowing only
six hits, but giving up all five runs.

The Generals scored their only
run in the top of the first, but allowed
five runs in the bottom of the third,
and that was all she wrote.

The Generals have a make-up
game against Hampden-Sydney today
and then they play a doubleheader
against Virginia Wesleyan on Satur-
day to end their season.

 

Sophomore Scott Covey
posted the fastest ODAC time in
the 400-meter hurdles at the
Catholic Invitational. Covey ran
the race in 56.1 seconds.

Covey also finished fourth in
the 100-meter high hurdles, and he
ran legs on the 400-meter relay
and the 1,600-meter relay teams.

Senior Charles Edwards
finished second in the 5,000-meter
run, and junior Bo Hannah finished
third.

On the women’s side,
freshman Sarah Gilbert led the
Generals by winning the long jump
and the triple jump. Gilbert also
ran one of the legs on the 4 x 100
relay team that finished fourth.

SPORTS NOTEBOOK

 

Saturday, the women’s
lacrosse team competes in the
second round of their ODAC
tournament against the winner of
the Bridgewater-Sweet Briar
contest.

RFK's son
rescues
freshman

By Tom EISENHAUER
Phi Executive Editor

 

Last Thursday freshman Rob
Robinson and two friends decided to
spend the sunny spring afternoon tub-
ing down the Maury River --- like
most W&L students would have.

This particular spring afternoon,
however, the Maury’s high waters al-
most drowned Robinson. He was res-
cued by Matthew Maxwell Taylor
“Max” Kennedy, a University of Vir-
ginia third-year law student and the
son of the late Robert F. Kennedy.

On the second day after Western
Virginia’s biggest flood since 1985,
the Maury at Goshen Pass was still at
flood stage, almost eight feet above
normal, according to lst Lt. Barry
Arnold of the Goshen First Aid Crew.

After 15. uneventful minutes in
the river, Robinson was leading two
friends as they floated down the river.

Robinson rounded a bend and
found himself being pulled toward the
heart of Devil’s Kitchen, the wildest
stretch of rapids on the river.

He went over a large rock, drop-
ping down into an eddy that immedi-
ately yanked his tube out from under
him. By the time he stuck his head
above water, the tube was beyond
reach, and Devil’s Kitchen was toss-
ing him from eddy to rock to eddy.

“Half of me was thinking that I
had to stay above water, and half was
thinking about some deep stuff,”
Robinson said. “I had a pretty good
philosophical discussion about death
and that this was as close to it as I
wanted to get.

“T was almost angry because I was
convinced I was going to die and an-
gry with myself for being ignorant.”

The rapids thrashed him for about
100 yards further downstream before
he could grab an underwater rock and
climb onto~a larger boulder above

water. d
There he sat for 35 minutes,

stranded 40 feet from shore.

Jumper and Miller had avoided
the worst of the rapids, while others
had driven to Goshen to get help, re-
turning with the rescue squad. But with
Robinson so far away, therescue squad
was unsure how best to reach him.

Luckily, Kennedy and classmate
Roger Freeman, both experienced
kayakers, were inatwo-man inflatable
kayak trying out the flood-swollen
river, which Kennedy said is “sup-
posed to be one of the best in the state
... when it has water in it.”

While Freeman waited on shore,
Kennedy picked his way through the
rapids to a spot upstream from Robin-
son. Kennedy then floated down to
him, hesitating just long enough for
Robinson to clamber in.

“He was kind of in shock and
bleeding,” Kennedy said. “He looked
kind of like a puppy thrown in the
water for the first time.”

Kennedy paddled the kayak down
to a calmer stretch of the river.

“T got out myself, bent down and
kissed the ground, and just sat down
and waited for rescue to come to get
me,” Robinson said. “At the time, I
pretty much didn’t care who [the
kayaker] was.”

Robinson escaped with mild hy-
pothermia, numerous cuts and bruises
from his chin to knees,

When Freeman and Kennedy re-
turned to Goshen Pass Saturday, they
realized how lucky Robinson had been.

“Things that on Saturday were
just little ripples had been 6-foot waves
on Thursday when we were out,” Free-
man said. “I was scared in the kayak.”

Students acknowledge campus harassment,
but question CRC's role, effectiveness

 

By LEIGH ALLEN
Phi News Editor

Most Washington and Lee students believe that ha-
rassment is a serious problem on campus, but don’t support
the Confidential Review Committee’s authority to hear
harassment charges.

That is according to a survey compiled by students in
Professor of Sociology David Novack’s research class. The
survey asked students how they feel about the CRC.

The vast majority of the 609 undergraduate students
who responded to the survey said that sexual, racial and
religious harassment are serious problems at W&L.

Only 25 percent of those students said they support the
CRC in its current form.

This lack of support, Novack said, could come from
students who don’t know what the CRC does.

The CRC is a committee of four faculty members and
three students that hears cases of harassment or assault that
the accusers feel are too sensitive to bring before the
Student Conduct Committee.

Less than half of the students responding to the survey
claimed to know the CRC’s function.

Even among students who say they are familiar with
the committee’s function, some question its effectiveness.

Renovations on the Kappa Alpha fraternity house, shown above, will
be complete by late August, according to University Coordinator of
Capital Planning Frank Parsons. However, he sald students will not

move back into the house until January 1993.

 

 

Sophomore Conshetta Brown said the CRC is not
effective in preventing harassment because most students
don’t know about it.

“I don’t see any evidence of deterrence” by the CRC,
Brown said.

Junior John Cross said date rape is a serious issue at
W&L, but that the SCC should have responsibility for
hearing such cases.

Some students disagreed.

Senior Denise Brainard said the CRC is necessary to
hear cases of sexual assault.

“Something like the CRC is needed on campus,”
Brainard said.

The survey found that support for the CRC is highest
among women.

Only 2 percent of men surveyed--- in contrast to 16
percent of women --- said they “strongly supported” the
CRC.

Novack said the students who conducted the survey
expected men’s and women’s responses to differ because
women are more often victims of harassment.

The most surprising result of the survey, Novack said,
is what little information students have about the CRC.

“If people don’t know about the committee, then what
kind of impact could it have?”

With spring term 1992 well under
way, the Pi Kappa Phi, Phi Kappa Psi
and Kappa Alpha houses remain un-
der construction; the future of the Delta
Tau Delta house remains in question;
and the new houses in Davidson Park
are yet to be started.

But University Coordinator of
Capital Planning Frank Parsons re-
mains optimistic that all 14 fraternity
houses undergoing Renaissance will
be completed by Sept. 1993.

The university stands ready to
break ground on the two Davidson
Park houses next week, Parsons said,
but both Sigma Chi and Sigma Phi
Epsilon will stay in their current houses
until fall term 1993,

The administration had hoped to
complete the new houses for $1.6 mil-
lion, But Parsons said that was unreal-
istic. Construction costs alone will run
$1.75 million.

“Tt all depends on what you call
the budget,” Parsons said. “In almost
every instance, meeting our standards
have caused us to spend more than the
original projections. But the difference
has been unreasonable expectations
versus reality.”

While the university would prefer
to sell the current Sig Ep house, the
future use of the Sigma Chi house, on
the corner of Washington and Lee
Avenues, is undecided.

“We could put a couple of aca-
demic departments in there, or possi-
bly [the office of] development,” Par-

Faculty members are divided over
a Student Affairs Committee proposal
to eliminate the Confidential Review
Committee and replace it with a judi-
cial board that would not hear cases of
verbal harassment.

The faculty is scheduled to vote
Monday on the proposal, which would
establish a Student-Faculty Hearing
Board to handle sexual assault.

If a student complained of verbal
harassment under the new system, the
Dean of Students would appoint a
mediator to attempt to resolve the situ-
ation. If the accuser were still not sat-
isfied, then the case would go before
the Student Conduct Committee.

Associate Professor of Journalism
Brian Richardson said the proposal
does not do enough to give students
full First Amendment protection.

“There’s still the possibility for
some bad things to happen on freedom
of speech,” Richardson said.

Law Professor Alan Ides, an alter-
nate member of the CRC, said the SAC
proposal is a fair compromise. Still, he
said, private universities should not
have speech codes.

“The best solution to a speech
code is not to have one,” Ides said.

Ides said he believes the SCC can
responsibly handle harassment cases.

Other faculty members disagree.

CRC member and Professor of
Religion Alexandra Brown said she
supports leaving the CRC in its current
form because she believes that the
mediation process suggested by SAC
would not be effective.

Students will be reluctant to

sons said. “Another possibility would
be Career Development and Placement,
freeing up space in the existing Uni-
versity Center for other purposes.”

As for houses currently under
construction, Parsons said Pi Phi and
Phi Psi are scheduled to be completed
by the end of June and will be ready for
occupancy in September. But while
the KA house might be completed by
the end of August, Parsons said KA
will not move back in until January.

“Wearenotanticipating that [KA]
will be able to re-occupy the house
until second semester next year,” Par-
sons said. “We are not digging our-
selves into any more holes like we did
in Red Square.”

This will make KA the only fra-
ternity that will go through Rush next
fall without a house, a fact that is not
lost on KA President Hank Huff.

“T think it might hurt us during
Rush, but we’ll just have to deal with
it,” Huff said. “It’s definitely been a
hassle not having a house, everyone
just tends to drift their own way.”

Although not participating in the
Renaissance program, Chi Psi moved
out of its house on Lee Avenue this
month to bring the house in line with
the new fraternity standards.

“We're renovating the middle
floor to include a house mother’s suit,
a president’s suit and five singles,”
said Chris Crenshaw, Chi Psi’s former
treasurer.

Other work includes adding an
additional fire exit, renovating upstairs
bathrooms, removing asbestos, add-
ing additional bathrooms in the party

to divide faculty

partcipate in mediation, Brown said, if
they know that the SCC would be their
only alternative if the mediation failed.

“[Students] need a body designed
specifically to handle more sensitives
issues,” Brown said.

She said she was the only SAC
member not voting in favor of the
current proposal.

In March, the CRC released a pro-
posal that outlined a “Principle of Ci-
vility and Decency” that defines what
the CRC considers unacceptable stu-
dent harassment.

The CRC’s proposal established
broad guidelines for student behavior.
In the extreme, it suggested that stu-
dents could be expelled for calling
someone ugly or using racist language.

According to Professor of Geol-
ogy Samuel Kozak, who chaired the
faculty committee that founded the
CRC in 1987, the committee sparked
controversy from its inception.

The committee was formed to
evaluate and suggest modifications to
the student judicial system, but did not
intend to create the CRC, Kozak said.

“The farthest thing from my mind
was that a committee to handle racial
and sexual stuff would evolve.”

Students on the committee sug-
gested forming the CRC, Kozak said,
because they felt uncomfortable han-
dling issues like rape and racial slurs.

The students also suggested hav-
ing a faculty majority on the commit-
tee so that the committee would appear
to be more responsible than the SCC.

Kozak said he was surprised when
the faculty adopted the CRC in its
original form.

“T thought, they don’t really want
to do this, do they?”

Renaissance enters last phase

room and adding a porch.

Crenshaw said the latest estimate
for the renovations is $250,000. To
pay for it, the fraternity took out aloan
to be paid from the brothers’ contribu-
tions toward the Greek Fee. The uni-
versity will act as subcontractor,
Crenshaw said.

The only house that may pose a
problem to the 1993 deadline is Delt.

After months of hearings, the City
of Lexington issued a conditional use
permit to the university in December,
right before the chapter was suspended
for 18 months. Under the terms of the
permit, construction must begin be-
fore December 1992.

Parsons expects the Delt House
Corporation to re-apply for Renais-
sance this summer.

“They will do so assuming there
will be a viable chapter ready to oc-
cupy the house in September. 1993,”
Parsons said. “If they pass the property
to the university, the house will be
ready by then.”

Besides the current projects, Par-
sons has his hands full solving prob-
lems, including questionable work-
manship, cropping up at the houses
already completed in Red Square.

But rather than workmanship,
Parsons said, the major problem was
in underestimating the amount of dam-
age the houses would suffer.

“At some times the architects have
been astonished at the ability of frater-
nity members to destroy things,” Par-
sons said.

“If we could start over, we would
do better. But we can’t.”

Washington and Lee law students are protesting one
professor’s insistence on the use of gender-neutral lan-
guage.

Law Professor Gwen Handelman has asked her Tax
Ethics class to use gender-neutral language in papers. If
necessary, students should use both genders. Students who
fail to follow these rules can have their grades lowered.

Law students have written letters to Dean Bezanson
and to the W&L Law News, protesting the requirement.

One letter, which appeared in the Law News last week,
was written by second-year law student Mitch Neurock and
Karen Orr, vice-president-elect of the Student Bar Associa-
tion and vice-president of the Federalist Society.

They believe Handleman is trying to impose her own
ideology, rather than a simple grammar rule.

Their letter called the use of gender-neutral language

“an outrageous instance of political correctness in our
classrooms” and said that these rules were created to “muddy
the intellectual waters of academia.”

Orr and Neurock said Handleman waited until she got
tenure to begin insisting on gender-neutral language.

In response, Handleman said that gender-neutral lan-
guage has been adopted by the American Bar Association’s
Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility. Since
these rules are used by the ABA, it is not unreasonable for
her class to use them too, she said.

Handleman does not demand that students use changed
spellings, such as using “womyn” for “women.”

Handleman said that she has been misrepresented in
the letters as a radical feminist and that the students may still
hold a grudge against her for opposing on-campus recruit-
ment by the U.S. Military, which refuses to admit homo-
sexuals,

Handleman denied trying to be politically correct.

“They've got me pegged as a radical,” she said.

she prefers ‘It

There’s a new regulation in the law school, courtesy of
Prof. Gwen Handelman. ‘‘She’’ — whoops, sorry — ‘‘it”’
requires that student papers use only gender-neutral pronouns.

Prof. Handelperson has mistaken the most recent dictum
of political correctness for grammatical law. Look it up. If a
subject’s gender is ambiguous, the masculine pronoun is used.

Prof. Handelperson might not agree with this rule, and
perhaps its gripe is a legitimate one, but that is not the issue
here. The issue is that here we have another example of the
Tenured Left doing it’s (their? his? Now we’re completely
confused.) best to regulate how we think and act. It is ironic
that those who claim the left side of the political spectrum are
so willing to use authoritarian methods to get their way.

By the way, Prof. Handelperson says this requirement
comes to us courtesy of the American Bar Association. Last
we checked, the ABA didn’t get to decide questions of
grammar. A lawyers is the last person we’d ask about proper
speech. Ever read a legal document? Whatever that gibberish
might be, it ain’t English.

Coming on the heels of last year’s debate about allowing
the military, which has banned homosexuals, to recruit on law
campuses, this new incident raises questions about the people
who oversee law schools. With what are they more concerned,
ensuring a strong education or political correctness?

In this case, once again education has been overshadowed
by political agendas, both Left and Right. There’s been
enough of that lately. It’s time to grow up.

Reviving a W&L
literary society

Thanks to the vision and sense of tradition of Matt Jackson
and Cameron Humphries, two of the most active members of
our student intelligensia, on May 20 W&L will get another
connection to its tradition-steeped past.

Jackson, Humphries and a group of students and faculty
they recruited have formed the Graham-Lee-Washington
Society, a literary and social society that aims to continue the
rich heritage of debating societies at W&L.

Once every six weeks, the Society will sponsor a semi-
formal ‘‘dinner debate,’ open to the first 80 people who buy
a $5 ticket. It will include dinner and ringside seats to see two
students debate each other, face cross-examination from a
student-faculy panel, and receive questions from the audience.
The first topic will be ‘“The Media and Private Lives.’’ ’

It sounds great. We only wish they hadn’t chosen a
Wednesday night; we usually have another commitment.

A word of caution, however. The Society’s goal of
“‘vigorous yet civil discourse’’ is admirable, but we’d like
more. Debate is not an end in itself — fireworks for the sake
of fireworks — but a means toward an end of understanding.

In the past few years, W&L has witnessed much of this
type of public debate in our campus publications. It was
entertaining, but too often it got us nowhere.

Instead of a reasoned argument that attempted to use its
Opposition’s ideas to arrive at some truth, too often we saw
impassioned and deafly dogmatic skirmishes, which are as
intellectually enriching as a well-played game of paddleball.
Someone wins the contest, but no one really gains anything.

We hope the Society’s debates will not sink into this less
glorious vein of simple ideological contradiction. W&L — and
its tradition of literary societies — deserves more than that.

PC language reigns at the law school .

 

My View

By Karen Orr, '93L and
Mitch Neurock, '92L

 

Well, we almost made it! We al-
most made it through an entire year
here at the law school without an out-
rageous instance of political correct-
ness in our classrooms. But it turns out
that our hope for a quiet year has been
dashed. And this is a big one...

This year's culprit, once again, is
Professor Gwen Handelman. You may
remember her from last year as one of
the professors who spearheaded the
law school’s ill-fated placement policy,
which attempted to ban the military
from recruiting on campus. This time
around, Mrs. Handelman has decided
to require that students in her tax ethics
class use “gender-neutral” language in
all written work. She (and we do mean
“she;” there’s no substitute for accu-
racy) has announced that she will fac-
tor in the use of gender-neutral lan-
guage in determining grades for her
course.

According to Mrs. Handelman,
this requirement is intended to pro-
mote goodwill in the legal profession
and to avoid offending female lawyers
in senior positions, namely herself.

Last week we interviewed Mrs.
Handelman in her office, to ascertain
her policy and the reasons underlying

it. While admitting that “gender-spe-
cific” language is not grammatically
incorrect, Mrs. Handelman told us that

grammar is not the issue. Imagine that!
Grammar is irrelevant in a writing
course! How about speling?

Mrs. Handelman also told us that
the “gender-neutrality” requirement is
no different from any other require-
ment set by professors for the routine
management of their classes. No dif-
ferent from, say, a deadline, or a page
limit. The fact is, this is not a purely
mechanical requirement; instead, itis a
demand for ideological conformity.

Realistically, “gender-neutral”
language is not “neutral” at all. It is a
perversion of accepted grammatical
usage and has been created by radical
feminists like Mrs. Handelman in an
attempt to further muddy the intellec-
tual waters of academia. “Gender-neu-
tral” language dictates favoritism to-
wards women under the guise of equal-
ity.

é Mrs. Handelman went to great
lengths to persuade us that her new
requirement was not ideologically mo-
tivated. Rather, she said, it is merely a
reflection of a perceived trend towards
this form of usage in professional legal
circles. This so-called trend, however,
is by no means universally recognized
or accepted in the profession. In fact, it
is easy to find female lawyers who
believe there are more important things
to worry about than pronoun usage.

On the contrary, Mrs.
Handelman’s action cannot help but
be ideologically based. Regardless of
Mrs. Handelman’s claimed motivation,
her students are being forced to submit

to her warped feminist conception re-
garding proper use of the English lan-
guage. Students with differing view-
points, such as those who prefer to use
grammar correctly, are to be dismissed
(and graded down) as old-fashioned
sexists. These cretins, after all, have
little respect for Mrs. Handelman’s
dizzy utopia.

 

‘Gender-neutral’ language
dictates favoritism
towards women under the
guise of equality.

 

To further illustrate our point, con-
sider the following: suppose a profes-
sor were to announce that he would
grade students down if they did use
“gender-neutral” language. Said pro-
fessor would instantly be denounced
as a sexist and an impediment to free
thought and expression. When Mrs.
Handelman does the same thing, she is
a heroine of the feminist cause, strik-
ing a blow for women everywhere.

Mrs. Handelman revealed to us
the astonishing fact that it is very diffi-
cult to remove a tenured professor for
cause. And indeed, it does not surprise
us that Mrs. Handelman waited until
she was granted tenure before she in-
stituted this farcical requirement.

Mrs, Handelman is not teaching
here as a free agent: she is part of a «
larger faculty community. As such,

other faculty members recognize the
ridicule they all receive when one of
their number embarks on such fool-
hardy expedition as this. In private,
several have expressed their discomfi-
ture to us. Every instance such as this
not only cheapens students’ degrees
(both law and undergraduate), but also
degrades the prestige of the faculty as
a whole.

Mrs. Handelman reminded us that
deans and administrators are respon-
sible for decisions regarding tenured
professors. Not surprisingly, an already
browbeaten and gun-shy Dean
Bezanson has expressed deference to-
wards Mrs. Handelman’s wishes. The
matter then, is left to us; we might not
be able to undo what Mrs. Handelman
has done, but we feel compelled to
raise our voices in protest.

It is unfortunate that the teaching
of law at Washington & Lee no longer
focuses on substantive material, but
instead centers on radical hi-jinx and
ridiculous points of order. In an effort
to score points with its highbrow lib-
eral counterparts, the law school has
abandoned its mission of solid teach-
ing of substantive fundamentals,

Instances such as this go a long
way towards explaining our school’s
fall from grace in the eyes of our pro-
fession, our alumni and our commu-
nity. Our school (and it is our school)
appears hell-bent on destroying any
reminder of its former glory, in favor

of the New Conformity. Correct gram-
mar is out, correct politics is in.

Wé&L student
saves a life

To the Editor:

On March 17, 1992, I attended a committee
meeting of local business people, City of Lexing-
ton officials, and three Washington and Lee stu-
dents who represented the volunteer student con-
sulting group (Commerce School).

During the working-lunch meeting, one of
our committee members became severely choked
and was aided by Daniel Spinosa, class of ‘93. His
quick response and successful use of the Heimlich
Maneuver brought about a positive result in a
possibly life-threatening situation.

I would like to commend Daniel --- and all
students at W&L --- for his actions. This was
certainly a good example of how our local com-
munity benefits from our student population.

Justice system is
the true outrage

To the Editors:

In all truth, this letter is not meant for the
editors themselves, but rather is intended to be a
show of support for the editors, and more specifi-
cally for Cathy Lopiccolo, targeted at those who
have recently taken it upon themselves to lambast
her for her reporting of the Hudnall rape trial.

Miss Lopiccolo’s article has been referred to
as “brutally insensitive,” “damaging and demoral-
izing,” “sensationalist,” “humiliating,” and “irre-
sponsible.” The narrow minded scope of these
accusations, and the letter “Phi reaches new jour-
nalistic plateau,” presented in at least as tawdry a
manner as it accused Miss Lopiccolo of using,
frankly piqued me quite a bit.

Brutally insensitive? Certainly these words
apply to Chad Hudnall, even if his testimony is
absolutely true (which I, and, I’m sure, many
others doubt). These words apply to rape, and they
apply to someone who initiates sex without first
making sure whether or not his partner is who he
thinks she is. And I’ m afraid I have to inform all of
those who complained, that an article on a “brutal”
subject must contain some brutality of it’s own if
the article is to be at all informative. Perhaps the
Phishould have just run the headline “HUDNALL
CLEARED OF CHARGES,” and no story. Would
that have been better?

Personally, when I saw that an outrage like
Hudnall’s acquittal had taken place, the first ques-
tions I had were how this could have happened,
what testimonies and deliberations led to that
decision, etc. And that is what I read. I found no
sensationalist additions on the part of the author,
There was no suggestion or innuendo in one
direction or the other. I will admit that I, too, was
disgusted by what I read. However, I attribute that

 

LETTERS

disgust to the proper party: Chad Hudnall and the
judicial system that allowed him to get away. I do
not see that by reporting such events that the guilt

‘ anddeplorability transfers itself to Miss Lopiccolo.

It also pains me to have to point out that,
despite what is claimed in the “Phi article was
insensitive” letter, “the supposed physical rela-
tionship between Hudnall and... Christin Harvey”
IS MOST CERTAINLY “the issue in this case.”
That was the linchpin of Hudnall’s entire shabby,
and unfortunately, successful, defense! “What
Miss Lopiccolo hoped to gain” by reporting this
was to explain how the accused managed to be
acquitted.

Yes, this event was damaging to the respec-
tive institutions of VMI and W&L. It is demoral-
izing to the sense of security which is prevalent in
this community. And do you think it was sensa-
tionalist, because it startled and outraged you?
Well, Washington and Lee you should bee out-
raged! You should be outraged at the mockery it
makes of our justice system when a man can be
found innocent of rape because he thought he was
having sex with someone with whom he claimed
to have had sex before. That is the outrage.

Therefore, in conclusion, let me say to Miss
Lopiccolo, that I, no matter how distasteful I
found the subject matter, appreciated your article
of March 12th. After all, if I’m going to be
ashamed of our legal system, I ought at least be
well-informed about why it is so.

Sincerely,
Colin J. Wynne, ‘94

Arrogance does
not serve students

Dear Dr. Hampden H. Smith:

I read with no small disappointment your
defense of the Phi editor’s coverage of the Chad
Hudnall trial. What is disappointing here is not so
much the Phi’s errors in judgement (as mere
college journalists, we all make them, myself and
the Spectator being quite certainly no exception)
as the self-righteousness and raw hubris with
which the affront to the student body has been
denied, Turning the traditionally light-hearted April
Fools Phi into a bitter outlash against the EC and
the student body constituted a new low for the
newspaper. Not to be outdone by your esteemed
pupils, the journalism department sided with the
Phi, Gentlemen, the surest way to allow a small
fire todevelop into an all consuming conflagration
is to deny the fire exists. But instead, you fanned
the flames.

The Ring-tum Phi is not the W&L Free Press.
It is not the independent publication your letter
described it. Student funds support the Phi, and
University facilities house it. That none of the
“alternative” publications receive either indicates

 
  

that both the University and the student body alike
have a vested interest in maintaining the Phi. As
financial supporters, then, they certainly may hold
it to certain standards. One hopes that any student
in your department, much less the rising editor of
the Phi, would naturally adhere to certain stan-
dards, call them ethics if you will, but if not, the EC
has not only the right, but the responsibility to
intervene. No other student group enjoys carte
blanche with student funding and neither should
the Phi.

It is one thing to make a mistake, quite another
to deny having made it. The professional integrity
of your department and your students would be far
better served with an apology than it has thus far
been with your arrogance.

Cameron Humphries, Spectator Editor

MacKenzie returns

To the Editor:

One of my recently heard-from attackers tells
us that since I fail to suggest “a single tenable
solution to [the] problems” I discuss, I am conse-
quently “no better than those [I] so adamantly
(criticize].” (Mar. 19, 1992) That’s an eyebrow-
raiser isn’t it? Let’s project this logic back upon
Germany in the late ’30s, where those too-familiar
dark Forces held sway (the same Forces which
have gone on to give us at W&L the Spectator and
the law school's Federalist Society). “Y’ know,”
says Joe Kraut in his Munich living room in 1939,
“these Nazis really suck.” Because he has not
elaborated on that statement with any substantive
solutions to the problem, Joe Kraut is now, by my
critic’s reasoning, every bit as evil as Hitler.

Interesting though it is to take note of, this
reasoning is not in fact relevant to my situation. If
my logician-critic had bothered to read the piece
which gave rise to all this “to vote or not to vote”
controversy (Feb 13, 1992), she would learn that I
did offer solutions. Three of them; two specific,
one general. And given the Phi’s spatial con-
straints and that I had other matters to discuss in the
piece, I think that’s pretty good. (Q: “What are
these suggestions?” A: Go back and look.) Still,
implicit in this criticism is an invitation which,
being a magnanimous person, I will soon take up.

The Law Wives’ latest scud indicates that
those redoubtable ladies may at least have read
some of my work. I give them high marks for that.
And in a way that obviously passeth their under-
standing, calling me “the quintessential tapeworm
in the stomach that is the American system”’ actu-
ally evokes something of an effective metaphor.
You see, the American political system can be
viewed as a big, slimy, involuted, foul-smelling
viscera, churning and gurgling with noxious juices
and reeking of putrefaction and decay.

But the Law Wives are wrong to suggest that
the Chinese Communists need any help from me.
After all, they have the full economic endorsement
of America’s democracy-loving government.

Cheerfully,
Niall MacKenzie, ‘93

Mailboxes
to leave
annex

By Amy YARCICH
Phi Staff Reporter

 

 

Students who get their mail at the
postal annex on Jefferson Street will
have to travel to the Lexington Post
Office on Lee Avenue next year.

While the annex has housed mail
boxes for nearly ten years, Postmaster
Larry Creamer said the post office rece-
ntly decided to centralize Lexington’s
mail delivery.

The more than 2,000 boxes at the
annex will be moved to central post
office’s empty basement over the the
summer, said Creamer.

Creamer said box numbers will
remain the same and the move will
mean that mail will be in the boxes
earlier in the day.

Creamer suggested to his super-
visor that the boxes be moved shortly
after he became postmaster last fall.
The U.S. Postal Service agreed to fund
the project.

Creamer said the move should
save enough money in rent on the
building to cover the basement’s re-
modeling costs in just two years.

According to J. French, co-owner
of the annex, the decision to move the
boxes came as a complete surprise.
While he said he’s sorry to lose his
quiet tenants, French hopes he will
rent the space soon because of the
annex’s good location.

The move to the main post office
could mean that fewer students pass by
the shops, which are on the way to the
Jefferson Street annex.

While Sandwich Shoppe owner
Frank Stinson said he “anticipates a
small decline in business,” owners of
Sweet Things, Alvin-Dennis, and
Wendell’s Barber Shop do not forsee a
fall-off in business.

“People will still want ice cream,”
Sweet Things Manager Rogo Koehler
said.

Former President Jimmy Carter addresses a packed Warner Center Monday night. In his speech, Carter
described his vision of a new world order.

Carter preaches charity, peace

 

By JAMESON LEONARDI
AND GREG PATTERSON
Phi Staff Reporters

 

Former President Jimmy Carter
said Monday the time has come to
build a world based on helping others

Speaking to a packed Warner
Center crowd, Carter said the fall of
the Soviet Union means it is time to
rethink the role of the United States as
the last superpower on Earth.

“We have, in effect, a blank piece
of paper on which we can write down
what we want to achieve in the future,”
Carter said.

Carter said the U.S. should work
to end wars in all corners of the globe,
not get involved in them. He also said
America should be a champion, not an
opponent of civil and human rights.

“Oppressed people shouldreceive
solace, not silence, from Washington,”
he said.

Carter cited nuclear arms reduc-
tion and environmental protection as
other qualities a great nation should
have. Sharing was his final point.

“We’re rich, butreluctant to share
with the poor,’’Carter said. “We only
use a small portion of the [gross na-
tional product] to help the poor.”

Carter pointed out the role of the
common man in the new order.

“Tt’s not just our leaders who have
a responsibility in the new world or-
der,” Carter said. “We have an impact,
too.”

Carter cited an undertaking of his
Carter Center at Emory University as
one way people can help make a dif-
ference.

The Center’s “Atlanta Project” is
an attempt to coordinate state, federal,
church,and business efforts to help the
poorest residents of Atlanta.

Carter said the targeted group, one-
parent families and teenage mothers, is
500,000 people, or 15 percent of the
city’s population.

In addition to coordinating the
relief effort, Carter said the Center is
also training volunteers to go into the
poor neighborhoods to help residents.

Carter said the main job of the
volunteers will be to help poor fami-

lies help themselves. The idea, he said,
is to make people feel they have some
control of their lives.

“There is a feeling of hopeless-
ness,” Carter said. “Poor people don’t
believe their lives can get better be-
cause no one does anything to help
them.”

Carter said he is optimistic about
the Atlanta Project and hopes that, if
successful, it would be duplicated in
other cities.

“The only guaranteed failure is
not to try,” he said.

Carter ended his speech by urging
the audience to help others.

“America has an opportunity for
greatness,” Carter said. “But greatness
begins with neighbors reaching out
and saying, ‘I care about you.”

“Giving people hope is the idea of
a new world order,” he said.

Carter’s lecture was sponsored by
the Robert L. Telford Distinguished
Lecture Series, an endowment estab-
lished by a 1922 W&L graduate to
support the visit of men and women of
national and international stature.

Ask Dr. WortTH
By Dr. James Worth

 

eae Thanks to Tom
a Eisenhauer and Cathy
Lalla SS Lopiccolo I have a

chance to write a col-

umn for the Phi which
deals with various kinds of mental
health issues and even controver-
sies.

Whether it continues beyond
this spring will depend on student
reaction. I really have no idea how
it will turn out.

I’ve decided to do it as a ques-
tion and answer piece. Hey, it
worked for Abby and Ann.

I’ve selected a question students
have asked me many times in the
past. But I’m hoping to get current
questions from the student body.
Bring your questions to me or Mrs.
Carol Calkins in the University Cen-
ter.

If you prefer, this can be done
anonymously by a letter stuck under
either of our doors or through a
phone call. My extension is 8592,
and my office at the University Cen-
ter is Room 128.

So here is the first question, one
which has come up a number of
times, especially during programs
on acquaintance rape and sexual as-
sault:

Can a man be raped by a
woman?

As a matter of fact this may
be happening far more fre-
quently than anyone
dreamed of.

A recent study, no doubt a spin
off from queries about sexual as-
saults on women, suggested that per-
haps one male in seven has been
exposed to some form of sexual as-
sault. Forty percent of these are fe-
male to male.

Now this does not mean that

 

male students at W&L are in danger
(in hopes?) of having a female stu-
dent jump out of the bushes one
evening and perform sexual perver-
sions on him.

This form of assault is exceed-
ingly rare.

What is surprisingly common
is for younger males, usually prepu-
bescent, to be fondled by or in other
ways sexually assaulted by an older
female, such as a baby-sitter.

The effect on the male has some
of the same characteristics as any
child molestation. That is to say,
shame, confusion, fearfulness, and
insecurity.

Most males never talk about
these experiences and, consequently,
they are greatly under-reported.

Later this spring a sexual as-
sault survey will be given to W&L
students and this year, for the first
time, will include data on men as
well as women,

In my practice here at W&L,
which by now includes over 2500
cases, I have had one instance of a
forcible sexual assault committed
by an adult female (a non-student)
on a W&L male.

He had picked up a woman
hitchhiker, who forced him at knife
point to perform oral sex. He was
not at all sexually attracted to nor
sexually excited by the woman, but
he did what he was told.

The point at which he felt actu-
ally “assaulted”, however, was im-
mediately afterwards when she
laughed at him and ridiculed him.

In my office several days later
he showed many of the classical
features of post-assault victimiza-
tion.

He felt a loss of self-esteem,
shame, anger, asense of lost control,
anxiety, depression, and difficulty
concentrating on his courses.

His counseling consisted of
having an opportunity to express his
feelings, to see that his post-trau-
matic stress was anormal reaction to

an abnormal circumstance.

He was a graduating senior who
could only see me a few times but I
think he was able to go a long way
toward getting past the symptoms he
presented initially.

with legs”, who
always want sex
anytime, anywhere, with any willing
woman.

So prevalent is this myth that men
often do not feel able to say no to a
sexually aggressive female, even when
they are not interested.

To say no would, in their minds,
be unmasculine and unacceptable.

While this is not a sexual assault,
it is a regretted sexual experience that
can have a negative psychological im-
pact on the male.

I have counseled a number of
men who confided in me their regret
about their sexual behavior, which they
engaged in not out of passion but be-
cause it was a role they felt they had to
play.

Most sexual assaults between
adults are males against females. The
overwhelming majority in fact.

But when boys and men are vic-
tims, whether it be heterosexual or
homosexual assaults, their reactions
are quite similar to female victims.

We are just beginning to see that
there may be a much larger number of
unreported cases than we had ever
imagined.

Hopefully in future columns I can
respond to questions you pose to me in
the coming weeks.

By all means, ask Dr. Worth!

Ben Worth, left, and Broderick Grady rehearse for Worth’s senior thesis adapts a Greek play to

E.C. Womyn, which will be performed May 25.

modern-day W&L.

Free love, communism and the EC

Senior's thesis satirizes W&L's institutions and traditions

 

NICOLE KEELER
Phi Staff Reporter

Ben Worth’s senior thesis, or at least part of it, is going
to be a little more public than most.

On May 25 part of Worth’s thesis, a play titled E.C.
Womyn will be acted out in front of Lee Chapel. E.C.
Womyn is Worth’s own adaptation of the Greek playwright
Aristophanes’ Ecclesiazusae.

“Tt was one of Aristophanes final plays” said Worth
“I’ve taken it and adapted it to Washington and Lee.”

For those who know what the play is about, it appears
that the adaptation is going to be a little controversial.

“Yes,” said Worth, “Youcould kind of say I’m digging
my own pit to throw myself into.”

In the Aristophanes original, the women of the city
become so frustrated with their government that they over-
throw it.

Leanne Jones plays the female lead character of
"Peyton."

"I play a very strong, focused woman,” Jones said.
"She feels the best way to get over her problems is to put
women in charge of everything.”

“In E.C. Womyn," Worth said, “Washington and Lee
women become so fed up with W&L policies that they take

over the Executive Commitee.”

They then tum the campus into a communist state and
communize everything, including sex, instituting a free
love policy.

“The women feel that it’s unfair for the handsome men
and women of the campus to monopoloize sex so, if you
want to sleep with somebody ‘handsome’ you must also
sleep with somebody ‘ugly’," Worth said.

Worth said he thinks E.C. Womyn is going to cause a
stir when it's finally put on.

“There is adult language and situations, but I’ve toned
it down alot from the original, those four Greeks - what they
were up to was pretty awful.”

One student felt that many students may get offended
by some of the potrayals in the play. "There are many
people at W&L who get easily offended," freshman Re-
becca Crow said. "Those who misunderstand the play will
probably take offense."

Aside from the language and the situations, the play is
also an open satire of many W&L institutions and tradi-
tions, some mentioned by name.

“Everyone should come out and see it and see them-
selves mocked and things they hold near and dear about
W&L mocked," Worth said. "Get angry, you’re supposed
to.”

Greeks address

By NIKKI MAGAZINER
Phi Staff Reporter

 

 

The first phrase that flashes through the mind when
you hear the word ‘fraternity’ is probably not social con-
sciousness.

But at W&L, where mandatory seminars on social
issues for Greeks are the exception rather than the rule,
this may not be far from the mark.

Almost all of the 16 fraternities and 4 sororities have
annual educational seminars on topics ranging from date
rape to career development.

Although the goal is education, many fraternities are
nudged by their national organizations to have seminars in
order to lower their liability insurance.

According to Lambda Chi Alpha President Shane
Kinzey, their nationals require them to have a certain
number of seminars in order to decrease their insurance
rates.

Kimzey said Lambda Chi has watched a video on
date rape and has invited police officers to talk about
different issues.

But Pi Kappa Alpha President Darren Braccia said
his chapter holds seminars on its own.

““Our nationals don’t make us,’’ Braccia said. ‘‘We
have them because there is a great liability with having a

social issues

fraternity these days. We hope we can combat problems
by making people more aware.”’

Braccia said PiKA has held seminars on first aid,
alcohol and drugs.

Lauren Hartman, educational director for Kappa
Alpha Theta, said educating members on real-life issues
is part of the purpose of Greek organizations.

“We look at our sorority as a forum for doing these
things,’’ Hartman said.

Sophomore Chi Omega Linda Stratton thinks it’s ef-
fective to have speakers talk about topics.

“‘They help familiarize you with a topic that you
might not otherwise go out and seek information about,”’
Stratton said.

Sigma Chi President Charles Edwards said his house
makes a risk management seminar mandatory for officers,
but holds seminars on alcohol and date rape for brothers
and pledges.

The date rape seminar was especially informative in
light of the events at the beginning of the year, Edwards
said.

Edwards said members feel the seminars are worth-
while.

“‘Some guys may be apprehensive,’’ Edwards said.
““But they’re usually glad they went and they do get
something out of it.”’

The Ring-tum Phi, April 30, 1992

New sorority is launched

Pi Beta Phi initiates 71, establishes Virginia Theta chapter

 

By JENNY MITCHELL
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Pi Beta Phi initiated 71 W&L
women Saturday into the newest
chapter of the oldest national wom-
en’s fraternity in the country.

The Virginia Theta chapter
was installed in ceremonies coincid-
ing with the 125th anniversary of the
sorority. Two juniors, 10 sophomores, «
and 58 freshmen and one alumna
were inducted by the Grand Council
of Pi Phi, the highest body in the
national organization.

The new chapter brings the
number of active W&L sororities to
four. Chi Omega, Kappa Alpha
Theta and Kappa Kappa Gamma

colonized in 1989 as the first sorori-
ties in W&L history. Delta Gamma
attempted to colonize here last year,
but was unsuccessful.

Pi Phi initiate and Panhellenic
Council member Joanna Love, said
one of the keys to her sorority’s
success was support from the other
three sororities.

“The idea that the other three
sororities were too big, and the cam-
pus needed another sorority was
really stressed,’’ freshman Love said.

Many members said they were
excited about the opportunity to be
charter members of the new chapter.
Among other things, members will be
responsible for writing the chapter’s
bylaws based on general guidelines

provided by the national sorority.

““We are setting our own tradi-
tions. It’s a neat feeling. The chance
to do this doesn’t happen to many
people,’’ sophomore Laina Ewan
said.

Pi Phi will hold a semi-formal
dance May 16, and will co-host a

“Spring Fling” dance with Kappa
Alpha Theta on May 22.

Freshman initiate Eleanor Roy
said she has high hopes for the new
chapter she helped found.

“It’s been fun to be able to
Start a new sorority and be able to
shape it,’’ Roy said. ‘‘I’d like to
come back in awhile and see what's
happened to it, if it’s what we intend-
ed it to be.”’

 

Get Set, Go!

 

Senior Martin Malloy
passes the batton to
freshman Kevin Batteh in

event raised almost $200
for Court-Appointed Special
Advocates, which places
abused children in state
care.

Baseball ends on down note;
_ Stickley looks towards next year

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE
Phi Sports Editor

 

So close, yet so far.

That would be a good way to describe the
Washington and Lee baseball team’s final week of the
season.

The Generals held leads in all four contests but
were unable to hold them. With the four losses, the
Generals finished the season with a 4-21 record. This was
the most losses since the 1985 squad went 6-21.

The Generals started the week by taking on the
Lynchburg Hornets. The Generals held their own
throughout most of the game, before finally falling 5-1. A
big improvement over their 15-3 loss to Lynchburg less
than two weeks ago.

W&L then faced the Hampden-Sydney Tigers. The
Generals led the Tigers early on and appeared to have a
solid grip on the game. However, the Tigers rallied and
took the contest 9-6. Again, the Generals played much
better but just couldn’t come up with the victory.

On Saturday, the Generals ended their season with
a doubleheader against Virginia Wesleyan. W&L jumped
Out to a 3-1 advantage in the first game, but gave it back
in the middle innings and lost 5-3. Senior TJ. Daly
started after throwing 90 pitches two days before. He
pitched well but was still saddled with the loss.

In the second game, the Generals led VWC 1-0.
However, the Generals were shut down the rest of the
way and lost their season finale 5-1.

The strong effort put forth the last week of the
season pleased head coach Jeff Stickley.

‘‘We were playing 100 percent better at the end,”
said Stickley. ‘‘The last week of the season was the best
we played.”’

‘‘We weren’t out of any of the games. We had a
chance to win them all, but we just didn’t put it together
in the end.’’

Despite the rough season, Stickley said there are
plenty of positive aspects to look forward to next season.

‘*All the guys are coming back. We’re only losing
four guys,’’ he said. ‘‘All the freshmen and sophomore
pitchers will be back, and that’s great plus.”’

‘‘Our strongest point.next year will be the infield
and catchers. Everyone's returning except T.J.[Daly]. So
we should be solid.’’

The returning players mark a bright future for the
Generals. Three freshmen led the team in four different
categories.

Catcher Todd Stanton led the team in hitting with
a .328 average; third baseman Duane Van Arsdale led the
team with four home runs and a .520 slugging percentage;
pitcher Brett Hartman posted a team-best 4.09 ERA.

Other team leaders included Daly, who led the
team with 17 RBIs and fellow classmate Brian Harper,
who posted a team-best eight doubles.

The song says, ‘“The future’s so bright, I gotta

wear shades.’’ It remains to be seen if the Generals future
is that bright, but it does show a great deal of promise.

Generals prepare for VMI

 

By JAY PLOTKIN
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee men’s la-
crosse coach Jim Stagnitta has seen it
before.

“It seems that whoever we
play seems to have their best game
against us,’’ he said. ‘‘I thought
Hampden-Sydney played as well as
they could in the first half.”’

But the Tigers were cooled off
after halftime, and W&L erased an 8-
6 deficit with seven straight goals and
won going away, 18-10. Senior Drew
Anton and junior David Lefkowitz
each scored twice during the run.

The key to the offensive
explosion was junior Derek Hutton’s
ability to win the majority of the
second half faceoffs. The Tigers won
nine of the 13 first half draws, but
Hutton tumed things around in the
second half, helping the Generals win
13 of 19 after intermission.

“Derek started to pick the ball
up and protect it,’ said Stagnitta.
“‘{Senior] Jeff O’Brien won a couple,
and that helped. And [freshman]
Michael Alessi kept the ball in the
middle of the field.’’

Hutton won 14 of the 23
faceoffs he took, and that allowed the
Generals to get into their offensive
patterns and put pressure on H-SC
freshman goalie Ray Lockard.

The Generals scored 13
second half goals, including two each
from juniors Wiemi Douoguih, John
Hunter, Lefkowitz and Anton,
sophomore Colin Higgins and
freshman Andy Dutton.

On the afternoon, senior Jeff
Roberts continued his consistent play.
Roberts collected seven points on
three goals and four assists. Hunter
had two goals and four assists, and
Lefkowitz had three goals and two
assists. Douoguih also scored three
goals. Junior David Schiminger added
a goal and two assists as well.

The defense allowed just one
third quarter shot for Hampden-Syd-
ney and 10 in the second half. The
Generals also won the battle of the
loose balls, picking up 70 ground
balls to just 45 for the Tigers. Over-
all, Stagnitta was pleased with the
team effort.

“Our defense adjusted and
stopped chasing the ball,’’ he said.
“‘We played with a lot of intensity.
We were all over them. We hustled
and played real hard. In the second
half we moved the ball better and
shot better.’’

Stagnitta’ was especially
pleased with Hunter’s and Anton’s
ability to score.

“Jeff Roberts and [junior]
Josh Levinson have been our con-
stants all year,’’ he said. ‘‘Dave Schi-
minger and Colin Higgins have been
there as well. But when Hunter and
Anton score, we win.”’

Lefkowitz scored three goals
for the second straight game and has
scored seven in his last three games.

‘‘David’s doing what he’s
supposed to do. He’s concentrating.
He’s got good stick work and good
eyes on the field,’’ said Stagnitta. ‘‘I
haven’t been real easy on him this
year, but he’s gaining confidence.”’

Lefkowitz has more than dou-
bled his previous two years’ goal
total. He has 16 on the season. He
had just 12 in his first two seasons.

The win improved W&L’s
record to 8-5 and 5-1 in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference. The
Generals finished second in the
ODAC and have been either first or
second in each of Stagnitta’s three
seasons as coach.

The Generals finish the season
Saturday with the fifth annual Lee-
Jackson Classic against Virginia
Military on Wilson Field. The Gener-
als have won the last three Lee-Jack-
son games, including 18-7 and 12-4
wins in the last two meetings.

VMI enters this year’s contest
with a 9-4 record and an impressive
win over Maryland-Baltimore County.
VMI’s strength is its defense, an-
chored by senior goalie Matt Ott. Ott
is ranked fifth in Division I with a
.688 save percentage on the year.

**VMI is better than they have
been,’’ said Stagnitta. ‘‘They play
hard and they shoot well. It takes
good shots to beat their goalie, and
it’s no secret that we don’t shoot
well,”

Roberts will be looking to
achieve a milestone in his career. He
needs six goals to reach 100 in his
career. He has scored six goals twice
in his career -- last year against H-SC
and earlier this year against Gettys-
burg. He would become only the fifth
player in W&L history to reach that
plateau.

 

 

From Staff Reports

 

The W&L golf team finished
second to Guilford in the ODAC
tournament earlier this week at the
Crossings in Richmond, Va.

The Generals fell 14 strokes
behind Guilford after the first day
and weren’t able to overcome the
deficit. It was Guilford’s first
ODAC Championship and stopped
the Generals two-year hold on the
title.

The Generals tried to rally on
the second day behind senior Jay
McKnight’s round of 72. The Gen-
erals finished the day at 308, but
Guilford hung tough and ended
their round with a 309.

McKnight and fellow class-
mate Clay Thomas led the Generals.
McKnight shot a two-day total of
152, while Thomas was two strokes
behind him at 154, Both players
were named to the all-tournament
team.

Guilford’s Cannon Morgan
was the medalist, by shooting a
149, beating McKnight by three
strokes,

McKnight’s 72 on the second
day the low round of the tourna-
ment.

 

~~ [SPORTS NOTEBOOK

Thomas was named the
ODAC Golfer of the Year for the
second time in three years. His
average this year was 77.7 strokes
per round.

The Generals, 33-2 on the
season, will now have to wait for
an invitation to the NCAA Division
III tournament. If invited, the Gen-
erals will try to finish in the top 10
for the third consecutive year.

The Washington and Lee men
and women’s track teams both
finished second at their respective
ODAC tournaments.

. The men finished a distant
second to ODAC power Lynchburg,
241-118. An injury-depleted
women’s team finished 19 points
behind winner Eastern Mennonite
College, 140-129.

The men were led by sopho-
more Scott Covey. Covey won the
400 hurdles in :55.6. He finished
second in the 110-meter hurdles,
and helped propel the 400-meter
relay team to a second-place finish.

Senior David Martin also had
an outstanding meet. He had sec-
ond-place finishes in the 800 and
1,500-meter runs. Fellow senior,
Charles Edwards finished second in

jump and the discuss throw, respec-

the 5,000, and junior Bo Hannah
finished fourth. Hannah also fin-
ished third in the 1,500.

Senior captain Jim Henry took
second in the shot put, while fresh-
men Robert Miggins and James
Mayberry finished third in the high

tively.

For the women, it was the
Sarah Gilbert show. The freshman
standout earned 41 of the 129
points by herself. Gilbert won the
long jump with an ODAC and
school-record leap of 16’-3’’. She
finished second in the 400 hurdles,
setting another school record of
1:16.9. She also finished second in
the high jump.

Sophomore captain Wendy
Neel had to compete with a bad leg,
but still set a school record. Neel
ran the 100-meter dash in 13.09. It
was a school record and earned her
third place.

Freshman Kim Herring set an
ODAC record in the 400-meter run.
She finished first with a time of
1:03.9. She also ran a leg of the :
winning 1,600-meter relay team.

Gilbert and Neel also helped
the 400-meter relay team set a
school record :53.03. It earned them
second place

Women’s tennis rolls
to second ODAC title

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE
Phi Sports Editor

 

Break up the women’s tennis
team!

It has been a spring to
remember for the Washington and
Lee women’s tennis team.

They are 10-0 since beginning
their spring season on March 11. This
weekend they captured their second
straight Old Dominion Athletic
Conference title.

The Generals won six of the
nine flights, four of the six singles
and two of the three doubles.

“‘I was very impressed,” said
head coach Cinda Rankin. ‘‘I was
extremely pleased. I think we did as
well as we could do.”’

Sophomore Genia Foster
started the ball rolling by taking No.
2 singles, classmate Kim Dickinson
won at No. 4, freshman Liz McCord
took No. 5, and fellow freshman
Cathy Gartin won at No. 6. At No. 1,
freshman Marilyn Baker took third,
and at No. 3, sophomore Mary
Nabers finished second.

In doubles, the No. 1 team of
Foster/Nabers took first, the No. 2
team of Dickinson/McCord finished
third, and at No. 3, the team of
Baker/Gartin took home first.

Even with the large number of
wins, the tournament was not that
easy.

‘We really didn’t win that
easily,’’ said Gartin. ‘‘Genia[Foster]
beat a girl from Guilford that she had
lost to last week. Kim[Dickinson]
won in three sets in the semis. I think
we just played really well.’’

Coach Rankin credits the great
play of her team with her selection as

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ODAC Coach of the Year.

*‘It’s all a result of the players.
If they play well it’s good for them.
Everything depends on the players.’’

‘‘T want the players to have
fun. In this ODAC tournament, it
looked like they were having fun and
they were loose. Yet, I’ve never seen
them play better.’’

It is the third ODAC title in
four years for Rankin. She also
coached the Generals to 12th at the
NCAA Division III Championships
last year.

The Generals now stand at 13-
3, 7-0 in the ODAC. They have a
chance to return to the Division III
post season tournament, but they
won't find that out until early Mon-
day.

Even if the Generals don’t
make the tournament, they’ve had an
impressive year. For such a young
team, the individual records are im-
posing.

Marilyn Baker finished the
year with a record of 19-3, Genia
Foster finished 18-6, Mary Nabers
ended at 15-9, Kim Dickinson was
16-7, Liz McCord was 17-6, and
Cathy Gartin ended with a 12-1 re-
cord.

What makes this all the more
amazing is the fact that none of the
six are above a sophomore.

That means the team is set for
next year. Even so, Rankin wants to
go to the tournament this year.

‘‘We’d love to go,”’ said Ran-

kin. ‘‘We’re ranked fourth in the

south, and it’s a 12 team tournament
taken from four regions. I’m not
terribly optimistic, but the door is not
closed yet.”’

MacNaughton and Yates no longer play doubles together, but they
will be counted on to lead the Generals past Swarthmore. That game
could determine if W&L goes to the national tournament.

10-9, on Roanoke’s own field,

The Generals had never

goals in her four years, said the
team was prepared for Roanoke.

“We had lost to them 3 halftime lead.

we were confident, we knew what
we had to do, and we came ready
to play.”’

Roanoke overcame an 8-6

goals to knot it at 8 all.

The Generals reached the
conference final by defeating
Bridgewater College 8-7 on Sat-

led the team with five goals.

In Monday aftemoon’s
final, Roanoke jumped out to a 6-

““If we were winning we

Men’s tennis wins eighth straight ODAC

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE
Phi Sports Editor

It’s becoming a routine for the Washington
and Lee men’s tennis team that they are not plan-
ning on breaking anytime soon.

For the eighth consecutive year, the Gener-
als took the Old Dominion Athletic Conference
title. W&L won seven of the nine flights during the
two-day event. They posted wins in five of the six
singles positions, and two of the three doubles.

Picking up victories in the singles were
senior Richard Yates at No. 1, sophomore Robby
MacNaughton at No. 2, senior Tom Mazziotti at
No. 3, sophomore David Schweppe at No. 5, and
sophomore Jon Ingram at No. 6. Junior Wes
Ruggles finished fourth at No. 4.

In the doubles bracket, Yates and Mazziotti
took No. 2, and Ruggles and senior Kelly Vandever
took No. 3. MacNaughton and Schweppe finished
second at No. 1.

“I think we played up to our potential,”’
said head coach Gary Franke. ‘‘I was pleasantly
surprised by our success because I did have some
doubts going in.”’

With his win in the tournament, Yates was
named the ODAC Player of the Year, and claimed
the number one spot in the south region. He also
received a national ranking of 39th. MacNaughton
was ranked 6th in the region and 51st in the nation.

The team is now ranked second in the
region behind Washington College, but they have
fallen to 22nd in the nation.

The last dual match of the season is Satur-
day against 7th-ranked Swarthmore. It provides the
Generals with two goals to pursue.

One, a win will give the Generals their first
.500 season since 1990. Two, and more important-
ly, this match will determine if the Generals will be
given a chance of repeating their performance of
1988 at the Division III tournament.

‘“‘We have to beat Swarthmore,’’ said
Franke. ‘‘We just have to successful. If we don’t
beat them, it would be very hard to move on to the *
tournament.”’

“It’s up for grabs right now,’’ said Mac-
Naughton. ‘‘If we win convincingly we have a °
good chance of going.’’

Another interest for the some of the players
is the individual invites to the Division III Champi-
onships. i

There are four automatic bids from each
region. That means Yates is assured of a bid.
MacNaughton’s sixth-place ranking in the region,
and fifth-place ranking in doubles with Schweppe,
puts him on the bubble in both cases. '

‘“‘With the four automatic bids from each
region it will be very tough for MacNaughton,”’
said Franke. :

‘The first doubles lost in the ODAC finals ,
hurt, and they’re ranked Sth. It would be very
tough for them to make it too.’’ :

SAN JOSE, Costa Rica --- Just south of
civil-war torn Nicaragua and northwest of po-
litically volatile Panama, between Pacific and
Caribbean coasts where lush green jungle cloaks

 

lies a political oasis, anation seated on a moun-
tain chain jutting from the sea, a home to some
3 million people governed not by a dictator,
and not by a crown, but by their peers.

Costa Rica boasts a shirt-sleeve democ-

beer.

At sodas, or cafes, politics dominates popu-
lar conversation, at least among the older clien-
tele. Legend has it that the last revolution, in
1948, was planned at the Soda Palace, a single,
large, high-ceilinged room just off the street in
downtown San Jose, where still today, mostly
men sit a formica tables scattered across a
concrete floor and drink Costa Rican coffee,

far fewer material conveniences than most
Americans, and far more repetition in their
meals: a lot of rice and beans.

Costa Ricans live in the shadow of the
First World. The best movies and t.v. shows are
in English, either subtitled or dubbed. The best
music is sung in English, and the best videos
are on MTV. The best clothes are “Made in the
U.S.A.”; they are also the most expensive.
Costa Ricans learn early that knowing English
is a prerequisite for affluence.

Nevertheless, Costa Ricans, or Ticos, are
intensely proud of their country. They were
saddened by the race violence that followed the
Rodney King trial in the United States, and

When Tico columnists write about Costa
Rica, they usually begin with some statement
like, “If we want our country to remain great.”
The Costa Ricans, unlike their U.S. neighbors,
seem secure in their national identity.

But if you ask the Tico if he is happy with
his government, the answer is often a reluctant
“no.” Reluctant, perhaps, so as not to give the
impression that he is not proud to be Costa
Rican, but “no” because, well, one need only
look around.

Alumni
return...

By JOSHUA MANNING
Phi Managing Editor

More than 650 alumni will return to Lexington
this evening for a weekend of activities including the
long-awaited unveiling of Old George.

There are fewer alumni returning this year than
last, but Assistant Director of Alumni Programs
Robert Mish, attributes that to both smaller classes
and the economy.

“They do pay a reunion fee tocome back,” Mish
said. “But that’s just a drop in the bucket with what
they might have to pay for plane fare.”

This weekend’s festivities will feature the class
of 1942, celebrating its 50th anniversary, and the
class of 1967, celebrating its 25th.

 

Mish said the most part of the week-
end will be watching and being with the 57 members
returning from the class of '42.

“They really are the stars of the weekend,” Mish
said. “In fall of their senior year they had Pearl
Harbor, and upon graduation they all went into the
war. The weekend will revolve around that theme.”

For the first time, Alumni Weekend will feature
| amiemorial service Friday morning, in honor of the

IL.

‘Following the service, a special lecture by Pro-
fessor Barry Machado on “The Irony of World War
II” will be held for the new Five-Star Generals, The
lecture will be specifically designed to replicate the
feel of a W&L class in the 1940s, It will be held in
Robinson 6, a classroom that has not changed much
over the past 50 years.

A series of reunion seminars will be held all day
Friday, including a special discussion on Vietnam
requested by the class of '67.

“Like the class of ’42, the class of ’67 wentright
out of here to war,” Mish said. “But their situation
was very, very different.”

The seminar panelists, which will include sev-
eral Vietnam veterans and a conscientious objector,
will address the topic “Vietnam: An Oral History” at
2:45 p.m. Friday in Commerce School 327.

After a two-year absence, Old George will be
unveiled Friday evening in a ceremony on the front
lawn.

At 8:30 p.m., the Lee Chapel bells will ring,

_.to welcome Old George

 

By Amy YARCICH
Phi Staff Reporter

The unveiling of Old George this Friday
evening amidst a three-minute fireworks display
will coincide with the return of over 650 alumni
and their families.

“We thought alumni weekend was a time
when both alumni and students could j participate
in the ceremony,” said Director of Communica-
tions Brian Shaw.

The ceremony, which begins at 8:30 onthe
lawn in front of Washington Hall, will feature
various speakers as well as entertainment from
the Johnny McClenon Big Band.

University President John D. Wilson will
make the opening remarks followed by a few
words from Branko Medenica, the Birmingham,
Ala. sculptor who restored Old George.

James Whitehead and John Warner, '40, the
two men primarily responsible for the restora-
tion of Old George, will also speak.

Shaw said Warner proposed Medenica as
the sculptor for the project and also helped se-
cure funding for the restoration.

Whitehead, who has been the Director of the
Reeves Center for the past ten years, “oversaw
the project and was the force behind it,” Shaw
said.

The original wooden statue of George Wash-
ington was carved from a piece of driftwood in
1840 at a cost of $100.

The statue sat on top of Washington Hall
until two years ago when it was removed to be
renovated.

The original Old George will be on display
Friday in the University Library's Boatwright
Room.

 

 

Five students guilty

Perkins said there was similar con-

 

By FRANCESCA KEFALAS

First-year law student Chris
Kowalczuk is appealing to the Virgin-
ia Supreme Court for the right to vote
in Virginia, after being rejected by
officials in Lexington three times.

Last Thursday, 25th Circuit Court
Judge Rudolph Bumgardner III up-
held Lexington Registrar Lucille
Joyce’s two refusals of Kowalczuk’s
voter registration applications.

Bumgardner's decision confirms
Joyce’s judgment that Kowalczuk is
not domiciled in Lexington
and thus cannot vote here.

Kowalczuk expects the
Supreme Court to be more
receptive than Lexington of-
ficials have been.

“This is a local issue
and there has been such an
aversion to studetns voting
for such a long time. Once
you're out from under that
kind of ‘pervasive attitude ...,”
Kowalczuk trailed off.

When Kowalczuk first tried to
register in March, Joyce rejected his
application because he listed Ohio, as
his permanent address. Two days later
he returned and declared his intent to
make Lexington his permanent home.

But Joyce maintained that Lex-
ington is not Kowalczuk’s domicile.

“T asked what had changed in two
days, and [Kowalczuk] said he had
changed his mind,” Joyce said. “I said,
‘Changing your mind doesn’t neces-
sarily change your domicile.’ ”

Additionally, Kowalczuk had not
paid state taxes or registered his car in
Virginia, two of the actions that would
show that he wanted to make Lexing-
ton his domicile, Joyce said.

Kowalczuk has said that Joyce
was correct in refusing to register him
the first time — when he listed Ohio as
his permanent address.

 

 

Jackson

But he argues that since then he
has stated his intent to make Lexington
his domicile. He said he is financially
independent, has a Virginia driver’s
license and last lived in Ohio in 1980.

“Everything I own is in Lexing-
ton,” he said. “When I leave Lexington
inthe summer, it’s for visiting people.”

One thing that puzzles Kowalczuk
about the controversy, he said, is that
Joyce allowed sophomores Matt Jack-
son and Ryan Dennard to register.

“Their situation is far more tenu-
ous than mine,” Kowalczuk said. He
said Jackson still lives in Pennsylva-
niaandhis parents claim him
as a tax deduction.

“Tf I’m not eligible
to vote, there’s no way in
hell that Matt Jackson is,”
Kowalczuk said.

Originally, Jackson
and Kowalczuk applied to-
gether. Like Kowalczuk,
Jackson listed his parents’
home as his domicile.

But when Jackson and Dennard
tried to register the second time, Joyce
said, Jackson told her that he misun-
derstood what she had asked him the
first time he applied. The sophomores
gave her a letter explaining why they
wanted to make Lexington their home
and detailing ties they have to the city.

“{Jackson] didn’t know exactly
what he was doing [the first time],”
Joyce said. “Mr. K [Kowalczuk] in-
structed Mr. Jackson, and this little
second-year [Jackson] followed him."

But Kowalczuk should have
known what he was doing the first
time he tried to register, Joyce said.

“T thought that anyone who was
just about finished with his first year of
law school would know what ‘domi-
cile’ means,” she said.

Kowalczuk said he expects the
state Supreme Court to hear his case
this summer.

“It is far from over.”

Five Washington and Lee students
have been forced to withdraw so far
this year after being found guilty of
honor violations.

The violations stemmed from 21
honor violation investigations and 10
closed hearings as of May 4, according
to figures from the Executive Com-
mittee.

EC President Giles Perkins, Sec-
retary Caroline Wight and Third- Year
Law Representative Jeff Kelsey said
there have been more investigations
this year than in the past, but the num-
ber of closed hearings and guilty ver-
dicts is about average.

Perkins said the EC has averaged
three or four convictions over the last
10 years.

Both Perkins and Kelsey said the
1990-91 year was abnormal with just
two closed trials ending in guilty ver-
dicts.

“The number of investigations
[this year] is real indicative of how
well the system works,” Perkins said.

Both Wight and Perkins said there
was abacklog of investigations in Janu-
ary, some of which were holdovers
from fall-term exams.

“Usually around exam time is
when you'll see someone looking off
into space, and wonder if they are
committing an honor violation,” Wight
said.

gestion last year at this time due to
winter-term exams.

Suspected violations reported dur-
ing spring-term exams will be tried the
following fall in the case of under-
classmen, and before graduation in the
case of seniors, Perkins said.

Forking and Wight said most of

Z the cases this year
have been re-
ported by stu-
dents, but Wight
said there is usu-
ally a professor
involved.

Perkins
said Lexington
community mem-
bers have also re-
ported suspected honor violations.

“T think it’s good — it shows
people outside the school respect the
system,”said Perkins.

Perkins said respect for the honor
system within the school comes and
goes.

“T’ve had indications that the fresh-
man class takes it [the honor system]
very seriously,” Perkins said. “It’s
much harder to convince the law stu-
dents to take it seriously.”

According to Perkins, the current
EC’s interpretation of the White Book
has been neither loose nor strict.

“Things are never cut and dry, but

CRC revisions

Drinks for everyone!

 

 

University President John Wilson welcomes senior Ellen Lewis to Lee House for
his annual cocktail party. Seniors ate, drank and made merry with Wilson
Monday and Tuesday nights in celebration of their approaching graduation.

 

 

Faculty members delayed making a decision on whether
to revise Washington and Lee’s student judicial system
Monday.

Professor of Politics Lewis John said the faculty de-
layed the decision on a Student Affairs Committee proposal
that would kill the controversial Confidential Review Com-
mittee because the issue was too complex for the them to
handle in one meeting.

“There wasn’t time to resolve all the different issues
that came up,” John said.

University President John Wilson called a special
faculty meeting for Tuesday and said that he hoped the
faculty would settle the issue then, according to John.

The SAC proposal would eliminate the CRC and
replace it with a Student-Faculty Hearing Board to hear
cases of physical sexual misconduct.

Cases of racial or religious slurs would first be handled
by a mediator with final authority given to the Student
Conduct Committee if the mediation process failed.

John said criticism of the SAC proposal came from
faculty with a variety of opinions, including some who felt
the proposal did not go far enough to protect a student’s
right to free speech.

Other faculty members expressed support for the revi-
sions proposed by the CRC in its self-evaluation study
released in March, John said.

In its extreme, that proposal said that students could be
expelled by the CRC for calling someone ugly or using
racist language.

John said that despite the hope of settling the issue
Tuesday, it is possible that a decision could be delayed until
next fall.

SAN JOSE, Costa Rica --- Just south of
civil-war tom Nicaragua and northwest of po-
litically volatile Panama, between Pacific and
Caribbean coasts where lush green jungle cloaks
the vibrant reds and yellows of rain-forest life,
lies a political oasis, anation seated on a moun-

’ tain chain jutting from the sea, a home to some

3 million people governed not by a dictator,
and not by a crown, but by their peers.
Costa Rica boasts a shirt-sleeve democ-

. racy. Here, the president walks the streets and

buys his own groceries.

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Atsodas, or cafes, politics dominates popu-
lar conversation, at least among the older clien-
tele. Legend has it that the last revolution, in
1948, was planned at the Soda Palace, a single,
large, high-ceilinged room just off the street in
downtown San Jose, where still today, mostly
men sit a formica tables scattered across a
concrete floor and drink Costa Rican coffee,
“lo mejor del mundo,” or Imperial, the local
beer.

The people here are generally happy, or so
they will say, even though most make do with
far fewer material conveniences than most
Americans, and far more repetition in their
meals: a lot of rice and beans.

Costa Ricans live in the shadow of the
First World. The best movies and t.v. shows are
in English, either subtitled or dubbed. The best
music is sung in English, and the best videos
are on MTV. The best clothes are “Made in the
U.S.A.”; they are also the most expensive.
Costa Ricans learn early that knowing English
is a prerequisite for affluence.

Nevertheless, Costa Ricans, or Ticos, are
intensely proud of their country. They were
saddened by the race violence that followed the
Rodney King trial in the United States, and
newspaper editorials here called on the United
States to look south for an example --- to Costa
Rica, where by necessity of space and re-

sources, racial and socioeconomic integration
prevails.

When Tico columnists write about Costa
Rica, they usually begin with some statement
like, “If we want our country to remain great.”
The Costa Ricans, unlike their U.S. neighbors,
seem secure in their national identity.

But if you ask the Tico if he is happy with
his government, the answer is often a reluctant
“no.” Reluctant, perhaps, so as not to give the
impression that he is not proud to be Costa
Rican, but “no” because, well, one need only
look around.

In a country famed for its bureaucracy,
government agencies are the newspapers’ big-

announcing a public auction. It was placed by
the “Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock,

Development and Animal Health.” Just one
mole hill in a range of government mountains.
Dealing with government for Costa Ricans
means lots of lines, lots of paperwork and lots
of time.

And many here say freedom and democ-

Alumni
| return...

‘ More than 650 alumni will return to Lexington
this evening for a weekend of activities including the
long-awaited unveiling of Old George.
. There are fewer alumni returning this year than
. last, but Assistant Director of Alumni Programs
Robert Mish, attributes that to both smaller classes
‘ and the economy.
; “They do pay areunion fee tocome back,” Mish
said. “But that’s just a drop in the bucket with what
they might have to pay for plane fare.”
‘ This weekend’s festivities will feature the class
of 1942, celebrating its 50th anniversary, and the
class of 1967, celebrating its 25th.
‘ Mish said the most fascinating part of the week-
end will be watching and being with the 57 members
returning from the class of 42.
‘ “They really are the stars of the weekend,” Mish
said. “In fall of their senior year they had Pearl
Harbor, and upon graduation they all went into the
‘ war. The weekend will revolve around that theme.”

For the first time, Alumni Weekend will feature
a memorial service Friday morning, in honor of the
' 16 members of the class of ’42 killed in World War
Il.

Following the service, a special lecture by Pro-
’ fessor Barry Machado on “The Irony of World War
¢ II” will be held for the new Five-Star Generals. The
lecture will be specifically designed to replicate the
: feel of a W&L class in the 1940s. It will be held in
‘ Robinson 6, a classroom that has not changed much
over the past 50 years.

A series of reunion seminars will be held all day
‘ Friday, including a special discussion on Vietnam

? requested by the class of ’67.

“Like the class of ’42, the class of ’67 went right
: out of here to war,” Mish said. “But their situation
A was very, very different.”

The seminar panelists, which will include sev-
eral Vietnam veterans and a conscientious objector,
‘ will address the topic “Vietnam: An Oral History” at
2:45 p.m. Friday in Commerce School 327.

After a two-year absence, Old George will be
‘ unveiled Friday evening in a ceremony on the front
lawn.

At 8:30 p.m., the Lee Chapel bells will ring,

The unveiling of Old George this Friday
evening amidsta three-minute fireworks display
will coincide with the return of over 650 alumni
and their families.

“We thought alumni weekend was a time
when both alumni and students could participate
in the ceremony,” said Director of Communica-
tions Brian Shaw.

The ceremony, which begins at 8:30 on the
lawn in front of Washington Hall, will feature
various speakers as well as entertainment from
the Johnny McClenon Big Band.

University President John D. Wilson will
make the opening remarks followed by a few
words from Branko Medenica, the Birmingham,
Ala. sculptor who restored Old George.

James Whitehead and John Warner, '40, the

two men primarily responsible for the restora-
tion of Old George, will also speak.

Shaw said Warner proposed Medenica as

the sculptor for the project and also helped se-
cure funding for the restoration.

Whitehead, who has been the Director of the

Reeves Center for the past ten years, “oversaw
the project and was the force behind it,” Shaw
said

The original wooden statue of George Wash-

ington was carved from a piece of driftwood in

1840 at a cost of $100.
The statue sat on top of Washington Hall

until two years ago when it was removed to be
renovated.

The original Old George will be on display

Friday in the University Library's Boatwright
Room.

Va. polls closed
to law student

 

By THOMAS EISENHAUER
Phi Executive Editor

First-year law student Chris
Kowalczuk is appealing to the Virgin-
ia Supreme Court for the right to vote
in Virginia, after being rejected by
officials in Lexington three times.

Last Thursday, 25th Circuit Court
Judge Rudolph Bumgardner III up-
held Lexington Registrar Lucille
Joyce’s two refusals of Kowalczuk’s
voter registration applications.

Bumgardner's decision confirms
Joyce’s judgment that Kowalczuk is
not domiciled in Lexington
and thus cannot vote here.

Kowalczuk expects the
Supreme Court to be more
receptive than Lexington of-
ficials have been.

“This is a local issue
and there has been such an
aversion to studetns voting
for such a long time. Once
you’re out from under that
kind of pervasive attitude ...,”
Kowalczuk trailed off.

When Kowalczuk first tried to
register in March, Joyce rejected his
application because he listed Ohio, as
his permanent address. Two days later
he returned and declared his intent to
make Lexington his permanent home.

But Joyce maintained that Lex-
ington is not Kowalczuk’s domicile.

“T asked what had changed in two
days, and [Kowalczuk] said he had
changed his mind,” Joyce said. “I said,
‘Changing your mind doesn’t neces-
sarily change your domicile.’ ”

Additionally, Kowalczuk had not
paid state taxes or registered his car in
Virginia, two of the actions that would
show that he wanted to make Lexing-
ton his domicile, Joyce said.

Kowalczuk has said that Joyce
was correct in refusing to register him
the first time — when he listed Ohio as
his permanent address.

 

 

 

Jackson

But he argues that since then he
has stated his intent to make Lexington
his domicile. He said he is financially
independent, has a Virginia driver’s
license and last lived in Ohio in 1980.

“Everything I own is in Lexing-
ton,” he said. “When I leave Lexington
in the summer, it’s for visiting people.”

One thing that puzzles Kowalczuk
about the controversy, he said, is that
Joyce allowed sophomores Matt Jack-
son and Ryan Dennard to register.

“Their situation is far more tenu-
ous than mine,” Kowalczuk said. He
said Jackson still lives in Pennsylva-

seq niiaandhis parents claim him
as a tax deduction.

“If I’m not eligible
to vote, there’s no way in
hell that Matt Jackson is,”
Kowalczuk said.

Originally, Jackson
and Kowalczuk applied to-
gether. Like Kowalczuk,
Jackson listed his parents’
home as his domicile.

But when Jackson and Dennard
tried to register the second time, Joyce
said, Jackson told her that he misun-
derstood what she had asked him the
first time he applied. The sophomores
gave her a letter explaining why they
wanted to make Lexington their home
and detailing ties they have to the city.

“fJackson] didn’t know exactly
what he was doing [the first time],”
Joyce said. “Mr. K [Kowalczuk] in-
structed Mr. Jackson, and ‘his little
second-year [Jackson] followed him."

But Kowalczuk should have
known what he was doing the first
time he tried to register, Joyce said.

“T thought that anyone who was
just about finished with his first year of
law school would know what ‘domi-
cile’ means,” she said.

Kowalczuk said he expects the
state Supreme Court to hear his case
this summer.

“Tt is far from over.”

Faculty delays
decision on

By FRANCESCA KEFALAS
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Five Washington and Lee students
have been forced to withdraw so far
this year after being found guilty of
honor violations.

The violations stemmed from 21
honor violation investigations and 10
closed hearings as of May 4, according
to figures from the Executive Com-
mittee.

EC President Giles Perkins, Sec-
retary Caroline Wight and Third-Y ear
Law Representative Jeff Kelsey said
there have been more investigations
this year than in the past, but the num-
ber of closed hearings and guilty ver-
dicts is about average.

Perkins said the EC has averaged
three or four convictions over the last
10 years.

Both Perkins and Kelsey said the
1990-91 year was abnormal with just
two closed trials ending in guilty ver-
dicts.

“The number of investigations
{this year] is real indicative of how
well the system works,” Perkins said.

Both Wight and Perkins said there
was abacklog of investigations in Janu-
ary, some of which were holdovers
from fall-term exams.

“Usually around exam time is
when you'll see someone looking off
into space, and wonder if they are
committing an honor violation,” Wight
said.

Perkins said there was similar con-
gestion last year at this time due to
winter-term exams.

Suspected violations reported dur-
ing spring-term exams will be tried the
following fall in the case of under-
classmen, and before graduation in the
case of seniors, Perkins said.

Perkins and Wight said most of
| thecases this year
have been re-
ported by stu-
dents, but Wight
said there is usu-
ally a professor
involved.
Perkins
said Lexington
community mem-
bers have also re-
ported suspected honor violations.

“I think it’s good — it shows
people outside the school respect the
system,”said Perkins.

Perkins said respect for the honor
system within the school comes and
goes.

“T’ve had indications that the fresh-
man class takes it [the honor system]
very seriously,” Perkins said. “It’s
much harder to convince the law stu-
dents to take it seriously.”

According to Perkins, the current
EC’s interpretation of the White Book
has been neither loose nor strict.

“Things are never cut and dry, but

Faculty members delayed making a decision on whether
to revise Washington and Lee’s student judicial system

Professor of Politics Lewis John said the faculty de-
layed the decision ona Student Affairs Committee proposal
that would kill the controversial Confidential Review Com-
mittee because the issue was too complex for the them to
handle in one meeting.

“There wasn’t time to resolve all the different issues
that came up,” John said.

University President John Wilson called a special
faculty meeting for Tuesday and said that he hoped the
faculty would settle the issue then, according to John,

The SAC proposal would eliminate the CRC and
replace it with a Student-Faculty Hearing Board to hear
cases of physical sexual misconduct.

Cases of racial or religious slurs would first be handled
by a mediator with final authority given to the Student
Conduct Committee if the mediation process failed.

John said criticism of the SAC proposal came from
faculty with a variety of opinions, including some who felt
the proposal did not go far enough to protect a student’s
right to free speech.

Other faculty members expressed support for the revi-
sions proposed by the CRC in its self-evaluation study
released in March, John said.

In its extreme, that proposal said that students could be
expelled by the CRC for calling someone ugly or using
racist language.

John said that despite the hope of settling the issue
Tuesday, it is possible that a decision could be delayed until

It’s time for action

The menacing issue of the Confidential Review
Committee continues to haunt this campus. As you can see
from page one, the CRC’s future was NOT decided Mon-
day, as our banner headline last week assured. Instead, the
faculty stalled the process once again.

Was it William F. Buckley who said he would rather be
governed by the first 100 names in the Manhattan telephone
directory than by the faculty of Harvard University? Perhaps
we can say the same about our governing faculty — if they
ever decide to govern.

During the recent debate on adding an additional student
to the Student Affairs Committee, Professor Kathy
Koberstein said that students should not be ‘‘burdened’’ with
majority representation on SAC because we are not capable
of making decisions on sensitive issues. Yet now it’s the
faculty that seems unable to make such decisions.

We are very disappointed in our faculty. Not only have
many of them proven that they have lost touch with the
student body, but this most recent failure shows that either
they are hopelessly divided on the issue, or are pleased
enough with the status quo to avoid making the difficult
decisions. Either way, like a courtroom jury, they must
continue until the decisions are made.

No one ever said the job of enlightening the minds of
2,000 young men and women is easy. We understand it’s
difficult. But we think this decision should be a easier than
most. After all, the choice is between a system that works
against enlightening minds and causes nothing but dissention
among all involved, and one that might cure this problem.

While we would certainly prefer a system without any
regulations on speech, one that is sustained by the ‘“‘decency
and civility’? within each of us as W&L students, we
recognize SAC’s efforts in hammering out a compromise.
It’s a compromise that makes a change for the better. A
system dealing with physical harassment (the Faculty-
Student Hearing Board), but leaving all speech matters to
ultimate student control (the Student Conduct Committee).

President Wilson has called the faculty into special
session Tuesday, and he has the authority to continue calling
special session faculty meetings — daily, if necessary —
until this issue is resolved. We urge him to continue to do
so until the faculty has made a decision. Do not allow this
albatross to remain around our necks until next fall.

Consider real life

As you probably know (or should know), a California
jury last week acquitted four Los Angeles police officers
of charges of brutality in the beating of Rodney King. As
we hope you also know, Los Angeles and other major
cities erupted into blood and chaos as citizens protested
what they viewed as a travesty of justice by a racist jury.

And in Lexington? Students frolicked in the Maury,
studied a little, drank a lot and enjoyed spring term.

Our point isn’t that students should have protested the
verdict by setting fires or stealing a few TV sets. And
we’re not trying to argue for or against the verdict. But in
a place where we’re supposed to be preparing for the Real
World, we think about reality far too rarely.

As W&L students, we are told from the moment we
set foot on campus that we are the ‘‘cream of the crop”’
and America’s future leaders. Invariably, however,
students — like the rest of the world — end up focused
upon their own immediate situations. And because life at
W&L is in many ways so idyllic and secluded, the
problems of the Real World often pass us by. We forget
about the America out there that we are supposed to one
day be leading into — and through — the future.

America needs leadership, someone’s leadership; that’s
obvious. W&L likes to say that its students can provide
that leadership. And we wholeheartedly believe that. But
unless W&L students make the effort — and in our
pleasant environment it is an effort — to plug ourselves
into the outside world, then each year commencement will
only release into the world 400 educated but
fundamentally ignorant future leaders. And that’s hardly
what this country needs.

and R. Scott Bell, '91

 

A tradition died at Washington
and Lee this spring, and we fear that its
passing is final and irrevocable. There-
fore, we are writing to give the Wash-
ington and Lee Men’s Glee Club a
proper obituary.

It is necessary to start off by not-
ing our admiration for and our loyalty
to, Dr. Gordon Spice (“Doc”), the head
of the music department. We do not
intend our remarks to be an attack that
calls into question Doc’s professional
capabilities or his personal attributes;
we consider him a good friend and an
outstanding instructor. However, we
do strongly disagree with his decision
to disband the Glee Club. We under-
stand that this year’s Glee Club per-
haps, at times, didn’t produce the same
quality of music that had become the
groups’s trademark. Neither of us
wants to see the Glee Club become a
mediocre group, but we are disturbed
by what we perceive as nary a struggle
to preserve what was, only two years
ago, a vibrant and talented singing
group. Maybe the group needed a bit
of surgery, but it didn’t need to be
killed.

The first explanation for the dis-
banding of the Glee Club is that the
music department didn’t have the nec-

- essary resources to adequately support

its myriad of singing groups. If this is
true, then we think that some of the
blame should be directed toward Wash-
ington Hall; this grave error might
have been avoided with the hiring of,
at the very least, a part-time musical

instructor. (Please note that our opin-
ions about the staffing of the music
department are ours alone; our state-
ments have not been encouraged by
any faculty member.) A case in point -
-- during the 1989-90 school year ---
“Doc” was doing his best imperson-
ation of Superman. Besides fulfilling
his duties as head of the music depart-
ment, he was conducting both the Glee

were no longer getting students who
were interested in singing in an all-
male group. If this is the true, then we
again note that this does not reflect any
personal agenda by “Doc” --- he is
passionate about the sound of an all-
male group, and he enjoyed his time
with the Glee Club. However, we do
think the demise of the Glee Club can
be attributed to the decision to make

resources were quite strained.

However, if the current budget-
ary reality is that the music department
couldn’tadequately support all its sing-
ing groups, then the Glee Club should
have been the last group before the
firing squad. After decades of produc-
ing damn good music and represent-
ing Washington and Lee as it toured
the East Coast, we think that the Glee
Club deserved special consideration.
Was the solution the cancellation of
the Glee Club, the oldest singing group
on campus, and the creation of another
mixed singing ensemble? Couldn’t the
Glee Club and the University Chorus
have been the two main groups on
campus?

The second explanation for the
demise of the Glee Club is that they

A decision was made that the Univer-
sity Chorus would become the touring
chorus at Washington and Lee, and
that it would represent our school
abroad and in its own series of con-
certs. Therefore, an effort was made to
attract the best talent to this group. The
Glee Club became the odd-man out,
and we believe that the available male
singers received the impression that
the Glee Club was no longer a unique
organization that represented our uni-
versity.

Some have suggested that the de-
cision to emphasize a mixed singing
group which directly contributed to
the death of the Glee Club, was afunc-
tion of co-education. We disagree. We
are both avid supporters of co-educa-
tion at Washington and Lee, but we do

&L's oldest singing group

think that some traditions of the “old”
Washington and Lee have a rightful
place in university life. The Glee Club
was one of those traditions. Co-educa-
tion didn’t bring about the destruction
of fraternities, but instead the univer-
sity made a concerted effort to save
them via Fraternity Renaissance. If our
university could spend millions and
millions of dollars to preserve one
unique aspect of the “old” Washington
and Lee, then couldn’t the administra-
tion have allotted funds for an addi-
tional faculty member in the music
department? And couldn’t Washing-
ton and Lee allow the Glee Club its
earned and deserved spot as a repre-

_ Sentative of our school? Not only was

the group a wonderful ambassador to
other schools via our touring, but count-
less life-long friendships were spawned
during practices, tours and joint con-
certs with other schools,

The Glee Club is gone; we fear
that no amount of alumni outrage and
protest will result in Lazarus-like
miracle. Therefore, in closing, we urge
the music department to cease their
alumni Glee Club concert. During our
four years at Washington and Lee, we
were involved in those concerts and
enjoyed them immensely. However,
we feel that the alumni concerts served
primarily to link the past members of
the Glee Club with a current Glee Club
that was alive and well. Since the stu-
dents and faculty have decided that the
Glee Club no longer has a place at our
institution, then let the group rest in
peace. If this year the alumni Glee
Club does perform, then please bill it
as the final concert of the organization
--- the group at least deserves a proper
and public funeral.

Sex confuses Swann

 

Let It RIDE

By Chris Swan

 

My roommate is watching Everything You
Wanted To Know About Sex, But Were Afraid To Ask,
another one of those movies that should have been on
my list in the last cloumn. I don’t know if you’ve seen
it, but Ienjoy the last scene the most. In it, the brain is
ordering various organs to perform their duties ---
Tony Randall from The Odd Couple is Mission Con-
trol, Burt Reynolds the Operator, and the various
organ groups such as Stomach, Eyes, Ears, and...
ahem... Privates are doing their best to function prop-
erly. It sounded like the bridge of a submarine: Dive,
Dive, Dive! Blow all tanks!

Woody Allen as the paranoid sperm is classic.
He doesn’t trust what the slides in Sperm class told
him about ovum and eggs; he wonders what’s out in
the dark void and fears it. His earlier fears about
“ending up on the ceiling” are replaced by, “What if
I get lost?” or moralizing over the appropriateness of
doing this to this girl at this particular time. With Tony
Randall screaming for Memory to start listing base-
ball stats so the Body can perform, I can’t help dying
of laughter.

Sex is one of those funny topics you’re not
supposed to talk about with your parents due to
reasons of sheer embarrassment. When my mother
was pregnant with my younger brother, my father
called me into his den, cleared his throat a little, said
something about bees, and handed me a book entitled
The Wonderful Origin Of Life. 1 learned that sperm
and eggs made a baby, even though Dad kept talking
about some bird looking for our house.

I learned nothing whatsoever about the process
itself, That was for my eighth-grade PE teacher, who
tried to instruct us on the mysteries of sex with apiece
of cinema we called The Film. The fact that the
teacher had just had a vasectomy sort of deflated his
facade of being “one of the guys.” The girls got to go
into aroom with a nurse, and came out one hour later
with very puzzled looks on their faces. They saw The
Film too, and as a result became feminist male-
bashers.

So high school inherited this mass of untutored
and inexperienced children who wished to stride onto
the field of sexual encounters like a bunch of Clint

Eastwoods --- say little, get the job done, and leave
with your gun in its holster and a whistle on your lips.
Going to single-sex boarding school in rural Virginia
put a damper on that idea. During mixers, teachers
would wander the grounds outside the gym and poke
into bushes and ditches with thousand-watt flash-
lights. “Necking” became exceedingly difficult to do
safely. One couple got caught in a dorm room, a
Cardinal Sin. I had a resident priest in my head who
looked like the Catholic priest on Cheers and shouted
about purgatory and burning fire. His counterpart, a
sly gentleman with a goatee, tail, and pitchfork, often
shut the priest up in a box and created erotic visions
of female dancers in my brain. Neither side won that
strange war. I felt like a battleground for the damned.

This environment created a number of very
frustrated young men who entered college, that won-
derful institution of knowledge that consists of en-
gaging teachers, challenging courses and absolutely
no rules whatsoever. At my boarding school, you
went to bed, ate dinner, attended class, rose from bed,
and performed in athletic events, all at a prescribed
time. In college, you can often sleep till noon, find
alcohol anywhere, and meet girls every single night.
Needless to say, I was a bit confused that these
creatures I had considered as incomprehensible sexual
tormentors were now sharing the classroom with me
and were often smarter than I was. A very liberating
and chaotic situation.

And the topic of sex became wildly different.
While I had once had a girlfriend at boarding school
whom I saw once every two months for five hours at
atime, I could now see girls twenty-four hours a day
and possess a real relationship if I so desired. I was
more confused than ever. I felt like Woody Allen,
fretting over the mysteries of what lay beyond.

eventually ended up witha girlfriend and doing
fine. I even became good friends with a few girls, an
unfathomable idea in high school since all relation-
ships with females were considered preludes to do-
ing the wild thing. The conflicting devil and priest

Individuality
is irrelevant

My VIEw

 

By Brian Carpenter

 

Hostility to the welfare state, belief in laissez-
faire capitalism, or the attitude that government is

- the problem, are a few of the basic tenets of the »

Republican party. While most people who de-
scribe themselves today as “Republicans” would
agree with these positions, how many of them are
aware of the underlying concept: the individual,
and his actions, free of interference, are the best
way to the goal of a “good” society?

The individual is considered to be of the ut-
most importance. Operating on the fairly safe be-
lief that this is the ideological underpinning of the
Republican party’s policies, a simple look at the
world in 1992 reveals that the Republican party
ideology, or the “cult of the individual” is no
longer tenable --- individualism as envisioned by
the Republicans is dead.

Developments world-wide are slowly destroy-
ing the peculiarly American belief in the “‘cult of
the individual.” Population is increasing, and the
earth is not expanding. More and more people
must share an increasingly smaller pie. Asa whole,
societies world-wide are becoming more drawn
together, connected by electronics, trade, and tour-
ism. No longer can a
nation act without
considering theeffects
its actions will have
on other countries.

What does this
mean for the “cult of
the individual?” It
means that people can
no longer live and go about their lives in an isolated
bubble. One hundred years ago, any hardworking
American could move west, and given the small
population, live essentially on his own, his actions
affecting no one else's. As people are forced to live
closer and closer together, it becomes harder and
harder to cling to one’s individualism. We become
inextricably bound up in a world community that
is interconnected in a myriad of ways.

The United States is the only country in the
world that still clings to the “cult of the individual.”
This has been obvious in our society for time
immemorial. Our heroes are all individuals: Super-
man, the Lone Ranger and Rambo. The individual
is not worshipped, but idolized.

Our society is becoming increasingly
communitarian. We no longer hear of the
Rockefellers, the Vanderbilts and Co. Why? Be-
cause today the individual cannot master the in-
credibly large amount of information necessary to
run a large company. The result is the increasing
power of the middle management, those who con-
trol the technical information. The business world
is becoming communitarian, not just in the diver-
sified power of most large American companies,
but in such organizations as the World Bank, the
International Monetary fund and the European
Community. The Republican party clings to a
business philosophy that is irrelevant.

Continuing to believe that the individual is of
utmost importance in a world that puts increas-
ingly less power in the hands of the individual is
illogical. Promoting the individual’s actions as
noble and good, whatever they may be, isno longer
possible in a world where our actions affect the
entire world, America is the only place in the world
where individualism has been carried to such
lengths, Individualism may have been workable in
a world where one’s actions affected only one’s
self, but such a world no longer exists, and never
will again. Why does the Republican party cling to
an ideal that is rapidly becoming irrelevant?

Our society is
becoming
increasingly
commuitarian.

Phi staffers win
regional awards

To the Editor:

Ithought your readers might like to know that
Phi staffers won two awards in this year’s Society
of Professional Journalists Region II Mark of
Excellence competition. Former co-editor Rick
Peltz won the Spot News reporting category, and
Craig Burke and co-editor Tom Eisenhauer fin-
ished second in the In-Depth Reporting category.
Those were the only two entries the Phi submitted,
so Messrs. Peltz, Eisenhauer and Burke are batting
1.000.

Among the Phi’s competitors were campus
papers from the University of North Carolina and
the University of Maryland, with staffs several
times as large as the Phi’s.

Congratulations gentlemen, and may the Phi
submit many more entries next year.

Petowners should
be responsible

To the Editor:

Several months ago a big, beautiful, gentle
Tennessee Walker Coon Hound came to myhome.
He had an out-of-state phone number, which I
called thinking some hunter had lost his dog. I was
given the name and phone number of a W&L
student.

I have since then called Rick a number of
times to come after Beau. Let me stress that at no
time was Beau any trouble to me. I was afraid he
would get hit by a car, hurt by another dog or even
shot by a local farmer.

At this time Rick has never called me or come

. after his dog..Always.one.of his housemates has
-come afteyBeauss- 6+ + nen
Today my fear became real. Beau came to my
home dripping blood from some type of injury to
his neck, ear, and jaw. I secured him by a chain,
called Rick at about 4:00 pm, and told him Beau
was badly hurt and needed medical care. I do not
drive, so I could not take him to a veterinarian.

There was no use to call Animal Control or
the Sheriff, because when I have called before
they said it was a weekend, either tie the dog up, or
let him go. “Too bad if the dog gets hurt,” I guess.

After several hours Rick's housemate came
after Beau. I asked him to tell Rick that I was very,
very angry at him for the neglect of this big,
beautiful, gentle dog.

My point is this: please write (as if it would do
any good) and ask the students to please secure
their pets by chain or pen so they will not be hurt.

I cry thinking about this animal in pain, be-
cause his master was too lazy to secure him by

chain or pen.

Rick, if you can’t or won’t take care of Beau,
please find a good home for him. Give him to me

Catholics must
vote pro-life

To the Editor: ‘

All the Democratic presidential candidates
are pro-abortion, including Catholic Jerry Brown.
Speaking as a Roman Catholic who participates in
the holy sacrifice of the Mass each day and prays
the Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary daily, it is
my discernment that no Catholic may vote for a
man who will facilitate abortions by appropriation
and legislation if elected. A Catholic is morally
bound to abstain from supporting those who ac-
cept the murder of fetal human beings.

If a Catholic votes for a pro-abortion presi-
dential candidate, this individual commits a sin as
he or she becomes a voluntary participant in a
process which ultimately leads to murder. The sin
of murder is a serious manner and, therefore, a
mortal sin. Those who die unrepentant with mortal
sins on their souls go to Hell, instructs the Catholic
Church.

Catholic Canon Law asserts that the woman
who aborts her child and those who perform the
abortion as well as well as those who pay for the
abortion are automatically excommunicated. It
would appear that this excommunication applies
to the willful pro-abortion voter also. Academic
theologians and American bishops have not wanted
to make this assertion. The episcopates are main-
taining a strange silence about the moral implica-
tions of voting for a pro-abortion candidate.

If a Catholic does not wish to vote for the
Republican candidate, he may refrain from vot-
ing. There are no circumstances in which a Catho-
lic may vote for a pro-abortion candidate. Confes-
sion is required for absolution of this sin, a mortal
sin!

AIDS does not
differentiate

To the Editor:

I am writing about the article, “AIDS & the
Heterosexual,” by Marc Short, that appeared in the
March 1992 issue of the W&L Spectator. Mr.
Short confidently states, “But what students should
know is that if they enjoy healthy monogamous
relationships, then they are not at risk of contract-
ing AIDS.” (p.13) Unfortunately, many of the
students who are involved in “monogamous rela-
tionships” while in college had put themselves at
risk for AIDS even before they entered college.

 

According to the Department of Health and
Human Services, more than 40% of high school
students say they have had multiple partners. There-
fore, one’s college partner may not be as pristine
as one had hoped. While I agree that the use of
condoms does not guarantee immunity from the
disease, itis not “absurd,” as Mr. Short believes, to
strongly suggest the use of a latex condom. While
I agree that there is no easy solution, I do not
believe that Mr. Short should assume that the
disease only affects homosexuals, drug users and
people not as “intelligent” as W&L students.

My mother is a nurse on a hospital floor that
treats AIDS patients. Every day, she sees more and
more bright, young, heterosexual people walk
through the door to receive treatment for AIDS.
AIDS does not differentiate by one’s sexual pref-
erence, educational level or class. Let us not na-
ively believe that we are always “safe” here in our
W&L world.

Sincerely,
Sarah Drain, ‘94

Alternate PC will
stop the clock

To the Editor:
I am writing in response to Karen Orr and
Mitch Neurock’s recent “My View” article. You
would think that college graduates who had shown
enough intelligence in terms of GPAs and LSATs
to get into law school would also be able to know
the difference between grammar and style, but
alas, such is not the case. In their complaint against
Professor Handelman for asking her class to fol-
low the American Bar Association: style guide-
lines for using gender-neutral language, they claim
that their desire to use “men” when they mean
“people” and “he” when they mean “someone” is
“good grammar.” No it is not. It has nothing to do
with grammar. Take for example, a sentence such
as this: “A law student recently attacked a faculty
member for violating his rights to use the pronoun
of his political choice.” Grammar would dictate
only that the pronoun (here, “his”) be third person
possessive. Style, however, would be a matter of
deciding, do we want the reader to assume that the
law student in question is male? If not, if we want
to suggest that a woman might be a law student,
and that a woman might hold such views, then we
would search for a pronoun that would not elimi-
nate the possibility. The sentence might be plural-
ized: “Two law students recently attacked...etc.”
The point is that the problem is not grammar.
Some claim that they use the male pronouns be-
cause it is so difficult to find substitutes, but all it
takes is a little imagination and skill-qualities we
hope our students might possess, or at least attain.

In the real world, the world of professional
writing, Ms. Orr and Mr. Neurock will find that
most. professional organizations have published
style guidelines that ask that people use non-sexist
language. The ABA is not alone. It would be a
failure in our educational mission for us not to
prepare our students for what is going to be ex-
pected of them when they are called updn to be
professionals.

Asto the mind-boggling suggestion that “gen-
der-neutral language dictates favoritism toward
women,” how in the world does the use of such
words as “people,” “their,” or “his or her” do
anything except suggest that women are a fully
participating part of the human race? For someone
to try to perpetuate language forms that are out
dated and exclusive is not a matter of “good
grammar,” it is an example of an alternate version
of our political correctness that attempts to stop the
clock or turn back. Wake up and welcome to the
real world. There are now both men and women in
it, even in law school, even at W&L.

Sincerely,
Pamela H. Simpson, Professor of Art History

Leary, Bensinger argue drug legalization, rights

By FRANCESCA KEFALAS
Phi Staff Reporter

The debate on drugs came to
Washington and Lee last Thursday
night when former Harvard psy-
chology professor Timothy Leary and
former Drug Enforcement Agency
Director Peter Bensinger argued over
legalization and individual rights.

Each speaker had 20 minutes to
make his point and five minutes for
rebuttal. They then took questions
from the audience.

Leary, an admitted LSD user for
30 years, argued that the federal gov-
ernment interfered in private lives
when it made drugs illegal.

Leary said the war on drugs is a
second civil war with the potential to
be as devastating as the first.

“How can you possibly use a |

metaphor for warfare when you're
talking about the private lives of the
citizens of our nation,” Leary asked.

Leary went on to compare
today’s federal government with the
U.S.S.R.’s under Stalin.

Bensinger disputed Leary’s pic-
ture of a tyrannical government im-
posing its laws on the private lives of
the people.

“When I was head of the DEA I
didn’t think I made the laws, the
federal government doesn’t make the
laws, the people do at county levels,”
Bensinger said. “No one has the civil
right to break the laws.”

Leary said he testified before a
U.S. Senate committee in 1964 about
classifying and legalizing drugs.

“We should educate people how
to avoid drug abuse, and the govern-
ment should license drugs just the
way you license the right to use a
car,” Leary said.

Leary said a person would have
to complete a training session on
how to use the drug before being
licensed. Leary’s plan would require
the person to pay for the training and
license, which would raise revenue
for the states.

Bensinger believes the police
need to get closer to people and es-
tablish trust in order to halt drug

Former Harvard psychology professor Timothy a Lee Chapel audience. Leary argued that U.S.
Leary states his case for drug legalization before drug laws interfere in people's private lives.

abuse. He also said education is vital
in keeping people from trying drugs.

“Tt’s more important to prevent
crimes than make arrests,” Bensinger
said.

However, Bensinger did say the
federal government should spend as
much on treatment of addicts as it
does on enforcement.

“There should be more money
for treatment,” he said. “The DEA
budget is $400 million -- treatment
dollars should equal that budget..”

W&L Professor of Psychology
Leonard Jarrard, who teaches a class
on psychoactive drugs, agreed with
both Leary and Bensinger.

“Most people in academia feel
that the real emphasis should be on
education,” said Jarrard.

Bensinger said that drug use does
not only affect the users, but the
people around them as well. He cited
an example where the post office in
Boston tested all new employees for
drugs. Those who tested positive for

illegal drugs eventually had more
accidents, were absent from work

more often and had more discipline
problems than those who tested nega-
tive,

“People that use drugs are less
safe and less predictable,” Bensinger
said.

Bensinger said England tried to
legalize heroin and found that ad-
dicts still bought street heroin, which
was stronger than the legal heroin.

Jarrard said from the data he has
seen that the English experiment was
not as great a disaster as Bensinger
portrayed, nor as much of a success
as Leary said.

Leary argued that legal drugs,
not illegal drugs, are the problem. He
said 600,000-700,000 Americans die
from using legal drugs every year.

“How does anyone die from an
overdose of cocaine, considering the

| expense and inflation,” he said.

According to Jarrard, Leary’s
statistics are inaccurate.

Leary said that making drugs
illegal is actually harming the public.

“Once you illegalize something
that people are going to do anyway,

you take away consumer protection,”
he said. “If the DEA is so worried
about the health of the people, why
don’t they put some money into the
environment?”

Leary said that, as a scientist, he
would love to have his theories
proven wrong, but said that bureau-
crats like the DEA would not allow
their theories to be similarly scruti-
nized.

Jarrard, whose specialty is physi-
ological psychology, was disturbed
by Leary calling himself a scientist.
Jarrard said Leary received his de-
grees and training in social psychol-
ogy, a field closer to sociology than
biology.

“He’s never had the training to
justify the kinds of statements he was
making,” Jarrard said.

Leary’s unorganized speech
prompted speculations from many
people including Jarrard.

“Either he is in the preliminary
stages of Alzheimer’s or he has taken
too many of the wrong kinds of
drugs,” Jarrard said. “Or both.”

Open Mon. thru Sat. 10-5:30

 

 

 

Q: What will happen if you don’t
pay the infamous Lexington car tax?

A: You, or your parents, might be
called into court, have the amount taken
out of your paycheck, or have your
credit affected.

The city treasurer has filed “‘war-
rants in debt” against students and par-
ents who have received bills and not
paid the tax, asking them to appear in
court on May 13,

City Treasurer Pat DeLaney said
this is not the first time she has filed the
warrants and that it is a common pro-
cess when bills are not paid.

“We send these to anyone who
doesn’t pay their taxes,” DeLaney said.

DeLaney said that people usually
pay the bill once they receive notices to
appear in court.

“Of those that go to court, a fair
number will get a judgement against
them,” DeLaney said.

DeLaney said that if people do not
pay the tax after such a judgement, she
can have their wages garnished or have
their assets seized.

DeLaney also said a notice that

the tax has not been paid will appear on
the person’s credit record.

“Six months or a year down the
road, a person might find their credit
has been affected,” DeLaney said. “It
comes back to haunt you.”

Some students who were called
into court said they might pay the tax
now, but they won’t like it.

“T’m sure the judge will say ‘Pay

 

up’ and I suppose
I will,” second-
year law student
Maury Kroontje
said. “It’s a high
price for the small
privilege of driv-

 

ingoncity streets.”

“I’m not
planning on pay-
ing it,” junior Christopher Lee said.
“Tt’s ridiculous.”

Junior Sam Rock thinks more stu-
dents should go to court instead of
writing a check as soon as they see a
court summons.

“Only one person I know of has
taken it to court and he won,” Rock
said. “If more people would do that,
maybe the city would have to retract
the tax.”

W&L alumnus elected Tuesday
to Lexington City Council

 

By KATIE YDEL
Phi Staff Reporter

 

A Washington and Lee alumnus was one of the three
new Lexington City Council members elected Tuesday.

Greg Raetz, ’71, finished third among four candidates,
with 23 percent of the vote. Other winners were Reverend
J.B. Harris, with 26 percent, and Jane Ellington, with 32
percent.

Executive Director of Development at W&L Lex
McMillan came in fourth with 19 percent of the vote.

Mayor H.E. “Buddy” Derrick ran unopposed in the
election.

Raetz, alocal accountant, has lived in Lexington for all
but five years since coming to W&L as a freshman. He said
he thinks it will be helpful to have someone on the council
who has a good understanding of Washington and Lee.

Having been both a student of W&L and a resident of
Lexington, Raetz said he is in a good position to help
relations between the colleges and the community.

Raetz said the city needs to keep students at W&L and
VMI better informed on issues like the car tax and student
voter registration.

Raetz told The Rockbridge Weekly that the major issue
facing the city is upgrading the sewage treatment plant.

Harris, a five year resident of Lexington, is a pastor of
the First Baptist Church. Lexington native Jane Ellington is
currently a member of the Lexington School Board and is
a strong proponent of a plan to merge the city and county
school systems.

Ellington also said that encouraging area residents to
recycle will be one of her goals while a member of the
council.

Harris believes that a lack of affordable housing for
low and moderate income families and a lack of recreational
opportunities for local youths are major problems facing
Lexington.

The open seats on the Council were vacated be Sidney
Brown, Louise Moore, and W&L Director of Com-
munications Brian Shaw.

Shaw said that he did not run for re-election because
the Council required too much of a time commitment.

Shaw also said he became involved in conflicts of
interest with some issues involving the community and the
university, and that he often abstained from issues dealing
with the university.

Grad earns rice and beans

Recent alum teaches English in Costa Rican village

 

By RICK PELTz
Phi Central American Correspondant

SAN JOSE, Costa Rica - Amanda
Hughen, '91, is earning her rice and
beans in Costa Rica.

Hughen, a volunteer for the
Harvard Institute for International
Development World Teach program,
has been teaching English in the Pa-
cific-coast community of Quepos for
two months. She will continue there
until December, she said.

“I knew I was interested in travel-
ling after gradua-

 

yelling over other voices to be heard.”

Because Quepos is a popular des-
tination for North American tourists,
Hughen said the students are “very
open” to learning English.

She said her teaching style also
helps capture their interest.

“A lot of teachers here are still
using rote, repetition,” Hughen said. “I
teach .. . [with] the communicative
approach. We do a lot more talking in
Class, a lot less memorization, using
material rather than regurgitating.”

Because Costa Rica offers little

Quepos, Hughen said, is a three-day-
old international newspaper, or infor-
mation from the community’s one sat-
ellite dish, installed by the United Fruit
Company.

Hughen lives with a local family,
and said she had grown accustomed to
the culture, even “rice and beans, three
meals a day, every single day.”

But culture-shock works both
ways, and Hughen said her presence in
Quepos has unsettled the natives’ ste-

 

tion,” said Hughen, an
English major who
also took Spanish.
“But I didn’t want to

just travel city to city. pa
I wanted to stay in one -
country.”

In February,
Hughen and eight
other North American
volunteers travelled

 

to Puriscal, Costa 4 Queros
Rica, less than 20 5 Ista Dei Coco
miles from Quepos | © G0FO0€ Nicova
for three weeks of ori-
entation.

reotypes.
“People here see North Ameri-
cans as
‘Dynasty,’ ‘Cosby
Show,’ ‘Simpsons,’
movies and tourists,”

she said. “But some-
one living in their
community” gives a
more realistic image.
World Teach costs
about $6,000 per vol-
unteer, Hughen said.
Of that, each volun-
teer is expected to
raise about $2,300.
Costs cover room and
board, plane fare and
health insurance.

PANAMA

 

 

ground in Costa Rican schools, cul-
ture, history and environmental edu-
cation, plus “very intensive” lessons in
Spanish, Hughen said the volunteers
dispersed to assignments all over Costa
Rica, “mostly in rural towns.”

In Quepos, with a population of
about 13,000, Hughen said she teaches
fifth and sixth grades.

Her students range in age from 10
to 15.

She is the only English teacher for
two separate grade schools.

She said she also teaches adults at
night.

“So far, it’s been great,” she said.
“The kids are incredible, really happy.
They have a lot of energy.”

But teaching amid a foreign cul- °

ture took some getting used to, Hughen
said.
“Thekids are totally undisciplined.
You have to have a sense of humor,"
Hughen said. **I had get to used to

alternative to public school education,
Hughen said the schools are “incred-
ibly homogeneous, socioeconomi-
cally.” And the people that are all in
one society are not "snobs," she said.

World Teach, which also places
volunteers in China, Ecuador, Namibia,
Poland, South Africa and Thailand,
prepares its teachers for culture shock
and homesickness.

“In orientation, they gave us a
culture-shock chart,” Hughen said.

It said to expect “moments of ela-
tion” at first, then to hit “rock bottom
anywhere between the first month and
first six months we’re here . . . to be
frustrated with the culture and lan-
guage. They told us to call each other
and see other volunteers. We’ve al-
ready used that.”

Hughen said she has not yet hit
“rock bottom,” despite being “‘cut off
from North America.”

The most timely news available in

Hughen said volun-
teers are supposed to get a stipend
from the Costa Rican government of
about $38 per month, but that has not
yet arrived.

“The Costa Rican people are so
open and friendly,” Hughen said.
“They know we are volunteers ....
They’ll give you the shirts off their
backs.”

Hughen said she recommends
World Teach, which is “very competi-
tive,” to people “comfortable with be-
ing uncomfortable... . Someone inter-
ested in travelling, but seeing another
country from the grassroots.”

After her teaching job is over,
Hughen said she would like to bus
through Central America.

“Central America seemed like this
dangerous place” before she came,
Hughen said, “but in reality right now
it’s really peaceful, with the right pre-
cautions, not as dangerous as on the
nightly news.”

Looking for signs of suicide,
dealing with parents this summer

the most obvious is a threat, which could be
fairly direct or could be implicit. Most people who
threaten suicide do not actually kill themselves, but
most people who do kill themselves have made threats.

old status quo, it's like going on automatic pilot.

Perhaps the most important thing you can do is to
be aware that this may happen and make some deci-
sions in advance that will either avoid the difficulty
before it occurs or, if confrontation is unavoidable,
enable you to make the most of it.

suicidal person a chance to be heard and even to ask for
help. You could save a life.

Almost everyone who is suicidal is also seriously
depressed.

If you have a friend you know to be very de-
pressed, they are more at risk for suicidal behavior.

Depression is not always easy to recognize. It’s
not just being sad or blue.

Clinical depression is characterized by apathy,
lower energy, tension and anxiety, irritability, mood
swings and/or changes in a person’s appetite or sleep-
ing patterns.

Anyone who is depressed and has a close friend or
family member who committed suicide is at even
greater risk.

Your parents may need more time to accept your
growing maturity and independence from them.

By your not challenging them too energetically at
first, they may be able to relax and lighten up later on.

If you are lucky enough to have parents (or even
just one parent) who are open to communication, sit
down and talk the matter over with them.

Bring up the idea that you are now used to making
a lot more of your own rules.

Tell them you don’t want to be disrespectful of
their values and attitudes but some compromises may
need to be worked out for everyone to be comfortable.

The most difficult part is handling your anger. If
you blow up at them, you appear to be the very child
you are claiming to have grown past.

But if you do nothing, you probably will feel
demeaned and unhappy. Be patient but direct. Point
out that all relationships involve compromise.

If you live under their roof they have a right to set
reasonable ground rules, and you need to acknowledge
that. At the same time it is not reasonable for them to
ignore your growth and development. As an adult, you
will relate to them mainly out of your enjoyment of
them, not dependence on them.

Let them know you look forward to a successful
adult relationship with them, one that will take patience
and understanding on both sides.

91 grad's new nels satirizes wal via Herman the Cockroach

 

By DAvip WILMINGTON
Phi Staff Reporter

 

“T subscribe to the nonsectarian

summer vacation is a time for college
Students to sit around the house all day
drinking beer in their underwear.”

Thus begins W&L graduate Jon
Sbar’s new, and first, book to be pub-

lished.

dergraduate Al-

manac: A Low -Life guide to higher }

through college life, including many |
examples from Sbar’s experience at |

W&L.

Referred toas “Exclusive Univer- |

sity nestled in the mountains of Tradi-
tional, Virginia,” W&L is depicted
through various satiric episodes.

Former Ring-tum Phi humor col-
umnist Sbar applies his familiar irrev-
erent treatment to everything from fra-
ternity Rush to Fancy Dress and ex-
ams,

Although most of the names have
been changed (to protect Sbar, not the
innocent), most W&L students will be
able to identify certain English profes-
sors, fraternity events, coaches and
local women’s colleges.

The book is loosely tied together
by the college adventures of Joe
“Black” Smith and his various friends.

Early on, Sbar mentions his ob-
session with a girl named Cassandra,
and the subsequent recurrence of vari-
ous characters with this name makes a
good running joke.

Other recurring themes include a
lovesick, philosophizing cockroach,
who writes entire pages of the book
while Jon is away from his computer,
and various references to Ernest
Hemingway, who writes a chapter him-
self (after being discovered alive on an
island with JFK, Jim Morrison and
Elvis).

The Hemingway chapter, in which
“Papa” narrates a Fancy Dress week-
end, is particularly hilarious because
characters from his own books keep
popping up and talking about how

in lieu of actual works, I would spend
my summer writing a book.”

Sbar, who graduated magna cum
laude in 1991 with an English/Com-
munications double major, is currently
employed at The Sun, a newspaper
located in “some of the few places in
Florida where it's legal to drive a golf

cart on the roa

During an interview from a pay
phone in a Winn-Dixie parking lot,
Sbar discussed his general opinions on
editors.

“Thate editors, they ruin my life,”
he said.

His current news writing assign-
ments are stories he likes to do. “I like
crime,” Sbar said.

He said the reason why he didn’t
geta full journalism major was becuase
he was too lazy to take the hard editing
class. He also said that most of the
professors he had at W&L are either
no longer living or out of the country.

“That could have something
to do with me,” Sbar said.

Sbar cites former Journalism Pro-
fessor Clark Mollenhoff as a major
influence during his time at W&L,
while crediting the entire English de-
partment with teaching him “a hell of a
lot.”

Sbar cites cockroaches as a major
influence on the actual act of writing.

As a self-proclaimed nocturnal
writer, he became obsessed with kill-
ing the hordes of cockroaches that en-
tered his home at night.

He does want to make it clear that
Herman, the cockroach who writes in
the book, “‘is real ... [maintain that that
is completely true.”

As to the allusions to W&L, Sbar
agrees that several incidents in the book
are based on some private W&L jokes.

He stresses that he hopes nobody
will take the jokes too seriously.

"The truth is, I love Washington
and Lee," Sbar said. " I hope that no
one thinks I meant anything even re-
motely negative."

As to descriptions of some of the
more earthly events in W&L life, he
says ,“Reality is my defense.”

Sbar defends his writing style and
the possibility of offending people. “If
someone is sensitive or offended, I
don’t care. But I don’t write to be
offensive, I just write to make people
laugh.”

Sbar’s book comes out this July at
the retail price of $9.95.

There is talk of a special price for
W&L students and a special mail order
for graduating seniors.

to teach at Moscow State University
in Russia
this fall.

Smith
said.

 

He
will teach

s hics at the
Smith Russian
universtiy. Smith said he will take his
wife and family with him. He said he
plans to leave a little earlier than
necessary so he can visit former stu-
dents in England and Germany.

Although Smith will not lec-
ture in Russian, more than half of all
Russian youth understand English.

The Fulbright Scholarship is a
competitive program that gives scho-
lars the opportunity to do research or
teach anywhere in the world.

In other EC business, the
committee on Monday voted to
reduce the waiting period between the
end of an investigation and the closed
hearing from 72 to 48 hours.

According to Wight, both the
accused and EC members felt that 72
hours was too long to wait, but that
extensions would be granted.

“If I were accused I would
want to get it over with as soon as
possible,’’ said Wight.

The EC will vote again May 11
to ratify the proposal, which would
take effect in September.

rty-one students:

get research grants’

Recipients will work with professors

 

By KEITH GRANT
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Thirty-one Washington and Lee
students have been selected for this
year’s Robert E. Lee Undergraduate
Research Program.

The students will work full time
this summer on either a_student-
planned project with the supervision
of a university professor or assist a
professor in research.

Associate Dean of the Com-
merce School Kenneth Ruscio be-
lieves that one prime benefits of the
program is that students and teachers
work together outside the classroom.

“It’s a learning exercise much
different from the classroom,” said
Ruscio, who will be working with
junior Jay Darden. ‘‘In this project,
we're like peers.”’

Ruscio and Darden will spend
the summer on campus investigating
the legality of funding inequities
among Virginia secondary school
districts.

Ruscio said schools in Northern
Virginia receive more money from
the state per student than schools in
Southwestern Virginia, a trend that
has prompted some school districts to
take the issue to court because it may
be illegal.

consultant to Democratic party lead-
ers, he is now a visiting professor at
Georgetown University.

Nelson’s speech will focus on the
violence that has developed in the
“arc of crisis’’ from the Adriatic Sea
to the Caucasus Mountains.

“It’s finally clear that what we
see emerging from communism, is
not a free Europe, but a Europe divid-
ed and weak,’’ Nelson said.

He said that recent violence in
central Asia makes him unsure of
exactly what the most up-to-date
examples will be next week. Regard-
less, the lecture will center on Ameri-
can foreign policy in Eurasia.

Moreover, the constitution goes to

Generals drop finale; miss tourney

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE
Phi Sports Editor

For any athlete, there’s no tougher time of
the season than the off-season.

It is the time when all the bad plays creep
into your dreams and all the good ones are
remembered with a sigh.

The Washington and Lee men’s tennis team
‘ must now face that time, but they can do it with
, their heads held high.

The Generals faced a ‘‘do-or-don’t go”’
situation last weekend when they traveled to 8th-
ranked Swarthmore. If they won, in all likelihood
they go to the Division III tournament. If they lost,

‘ it was over.

Swarthmore 7, W&L 2.

The score is somewhat deceptive. Four of

' the matches were decided in the third set. The
_ Generals took one of the four.

Man-for-man we played very well,’’ said

: head coach Gary Franke. ‘‘It all came down to
losing the three three-setters.”’

The two most important came in the singles
competition. Junior Wes Ruggles lost at No. 4, 6-2,
3-6, 6-3; and sophomore David Schweppe fell 3-6,
6-4, 6-4, Added to Swarthmore’s three other singles
victories, the match was over.

‘‘The scores were indicative of a close

' match,’’ said senior Richard Yates. ‘‘If some things
went our way, we would have won.”’

Yates lost his No. 1 singles match 6-2, 6-2.
His doubles partner, senior Tom Mazziotti, also lost

at No. 3 singles, 6-1, 6-1. Nevertheless, the two
rebounded to post the Generals second win of the
day at No. 2 doubles, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3. It was the only
three-set match the Generals won.

WA&L picked up its only singles win at No.
2, as sophomore Robby MacNaughton continued
his impressive play by polishing off his opponent,
6-4, 6-1.

The Generals other three defeats came at
No. 6 singles, where sophomore Jon Ingram lost 6-
2, 6-3. The No. 1 doubles team of MacNaughton
and Schweppe lost the third three-setter of the
afternoon, 2-6, 6-3, 6-3; finally, the team of
Ruggles and senior Kelly Vandever lost at No. 3
doubles 7-6(7-3), 6-2.

“The four and five[singles] matches were
really close,’’ said Mazziotti. ‘‘If one of them won,
it could have turned out different. We played well,
but just came up short.”’

The Generals ended their season at 8-10.
Despite the sub-.500 season, the Generals had a lot
to be proud of.

They were ODAC champions for the eighth
consecutive year, and their ODAC dual-match
winning steak was extended to 40. Plus, they had
very good showings against some of the top teams
in all the college divisions.

‘*Overall we had a great year,”’ said Franke.
‘The only setback was the lost to Wooster.’’

Vandever, a W&L Scholar-Athlete, said not
achieving their preseason goal was the biggest
disappointment of the season.

“‘The season is a little The We

‘Derek had a big part in the
win,” said Stagnitta. ‘‘The eighth
goal took a lot out of them. He
won the draw and ran by
everyone.”’

‘*Both [Head] Coach [Doug]
Bartlett and I thought Hutton was
a big key in the game,”’ said Hope.
“He exploited our weakness,
facing off, and had a big goal. He
also came up big picking up a lot
of contested ground balls.’’

outshot VMI 29-9 in the second
half and picked up 31 ground balls
to VMI’s 17. The Generals also
forced the Keydets into 23 unsuc-
cessful clear attempts in 35 chanc-
es on the day.

‘Depth was the key to the
game,’’ said Hope. ‘‘It’s no secret
that we haven’t been able to play a

lot of people this year because we
just don’t have the numbers, and
on a hot day we just wore down
late in the game.”’

W&L senior goalie Coleman
Devlin didn’t allow a goal in the
game’s final 20 minutes while
making 14 saves on the day.

“Coleman was the first per-
son that Coach Bartlett went and
congratulated after the game,”’ said
Hope. ‘‘He’s an excellent low-ball
goalie, and we shot at his feet all
day. He came up really big.”’

Sophomore midfielder Colin
Higgins and junior attackman
David Lefkowitz added two goals
each for W&L.

Ott made 16 saves for VMI
to finish with 316 on the season.

W&L is ranked 16th in the
final Division III poll, improves to
9-5 on the season. The win was

Jackson Classic.

expected to go to nationals, but we didn’t because
we had some tough defeats early in the season.”’

This is only the second time in the last eight
years the Generals didn’t receive a team bid to the
Division II tournament. The last time was in 1990.

Even with the tough defeats throughout the
season, all the Generals managed to post impres-
sive records.

Yates finished at 20-11, MacNaughton
ended at 18-8, while Mazziotti had a 10-16 record.
The bottom three singles also carried their load.
Ruggles finished 9-16, Schweppe ended at 14-10,
and Ingram went 8-8. Overall, the Generals singles
record was 85-80. The doubles teams posted a
record of 43-38.

The focus now shifts to the individual
Division III tournament. Yates has already qualified
for the event at Emory University in Atlanta, while
MacNaughton must now wait and see if someone
withdrawals because he is the first national alter-
nate.

Yates says his principal concern before the
tournament is being physically ready.

“‘The key is to stay in good physical shape
this next week-and-a-half, and to go in ready.
Anybody has a chance to win. There’s not anybody
head-and-shoulders above the rest.”’

For Richard Yates, Tom Mazziotti and Kelly §

Vandever, this is all she wrote. All three say the
things they will miss the most is the camaraderie
and the competitiveness.

W&L students have a chance to

see cycling’s best, including
America’s Greg LeMond, as the Tour
Du Pont passes through Goshen next
<= Thursday.
f The Tour, a 1,000-mile, 11-day
race, will bring almost 100
professional and amateur riders near
Lexington as they race from Hot
Springs to the Wintergreen Resort.

As part of the race’s eighth
Stage, cyclists will bike through
Goshen on Route 39 between 10 and
10:30 a.m. Spectators will be able to
watch the race anywhere along Route
39 between Goshen and _ the
intersection with Route 252.

Race officials said that anyone
who wants to watch the cyclists

Thursday’s 98-mile race is
considered the most challenging stage
of this year’s event. Racers will have
to climb three mountains--up Warm
Springs Mountain, over the Blue
Ridge Parkway and up Wintergreen
Mountain--during this leg of the race.

The 1992 Tour begins in Dover,
Delaware on May 8 and will wind
through the Pennsylvania’s Pocono

Hagerstown, Maryland and through
Harrisonburg before Thursday’s run
through Goshen.

Organizers say that the event

Devlin said it was tough at

sometimes get overlooked because
it’s such an individual position in a

The forgotten senior was Tom
Snedeker. He didn’t play his sopho-

back from a knee injury early this
year, but appeared in the last four

This year’s race will feature 14
teams with seven riders each. Ten of
the teams are corporate-sponsored,
while four of the teams are amateur
national teams from Russia, Germany,
Belgium and the U.S.

Greg LeMond, the first
American ever to win the grueling
Tour de France, will be racing for
the “‘Z’’ team from France. He will
be wearing a light blue jersey with a
yellow and red Z on it. LeMond
finished 12th in last year’s race.

Defending Tour de France
winner, Laurent Fignon, will be
wearing Gatorade’s green, black and
orange jersey.

Spectators should look for the
rider with a yellow jersey, this
indicates the leader of the race up to
that stage.

But not this year. The seniors
will walk away from their lacrosse
careers with an overall record of 33-
22 and the knowledge that they
helped rebuild a once-proud lacrosse
tradition, Stagnitta is thankful for that.

“This is a class that achieved
because they worked real hard,”” he
said. ‘‘Huke couldn’t catch when he
was a freshman. Roberts and O’Brien
didn’t come from established lacrosse
programs. They all had to spend a lot
of time working on their own, and
hopefully the younger kids will real-
ize how hard they worked.”’

And they can also remember
that the last time they took the field,
they came away winners.

Seniors leave mark on men’s lax program

 

By JAY PLOTKIN
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Over the last four years, the
Washington and Lee men’s lacrosse
team has come a long way.

In 1989, the Generals finished
just 4-9, and just three years later, the
Generals had put together three
straight winning seasons, finishing
this season with a 9-5 clip.

As the team improved over the
years, so did its players, six of whom
will graduate in June. As freshmen,
only Drew Anton played significantly
for then-coach Dennis Daly.

Anton scored four goals as a
freshman playing both midfield and
attack, and was the team’s top fresh-
man, winning the C. W. Pacy award.
Goalie Coleman Devlin made one
start in 1989 and made 12 saves in a

loss to Roanoke.

Jeff Roberts and Tom Sned-
eker played as a defensive attackmen
and were used only on riding situa-
tions. Jeff O’Brien and Robert Huke
both didn’t see enough action to earn
a letter.

After winning their final game
of 1989, 10-9 in overtime against
Virginia Military in the Lee-Jackson
Classic, the W&L lacrosse program
underwent a changing of the guard.

Jim Stagnitta replaced Daly as
coach, and the program turned
around. The Generals went a remark-
able 9-4, earned a national ranking of
11th and were seemingly one game
away from an NCAA Tournament
berth. The sophomores, after sitting
for one year, played some significant
roles.

Devlin served as Tom Cost-

ello’s able bodied back-up, and Huke
was ready if W&L’s solid defense of
All-Americans Reid Campbell and
Mike Nunan and David Farace need-
ed a break. O’Brien played significant
minutes as the defensive midfielder,
and both Huke and O’Brien earned
their first letters.

But it was on the offense
where the sophomores made their
presence felt. Roberts was inserted as
an offensive attackman and played
consistently as the third attackman.
He scored 19 goals, the second high-
est on the team, and added nine as-
sists.

Devlin said the difference
between the two seasons was one
he’ll never forget.

“I remember the transition
that the program has gone through,
both in coaching and the results,’” he

W&L wins fourth Classic

 

By JAY PLOTKIN
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee is making
it a habit in the Lee-Jackson Lacrosse
Classic of starting slowly and rallying
for a win.

Twice in the previous three
meetings, the Virginia Military Insti-
tute held W&L in check before the
Generals mounted a late charge that
caught the Keydets.

In 1989, VMI led 9-8 before
WA&L rallied for a 10-9 overtime win.
In 1990, W&L led 6-5 at halftime
and exploded for 11 goals and a 18-7
victory.

The 1992 Classic was no
different. VMI led 3-2 at halftime and
5-4 in the third quarter only to watch
WA&L score the last nine goals to run
away with a 13-5 win.

Senior attackman Jeff Roberts
scored three of his four goals in the
second half to lead the explosion.

‘In the first half, their defend-
ers were trying to shut our attackmen

said. ‘‘I didn’t play much, and I never
expected we'd be playing as well as
we have over the four years.”’

Roberts was named the team’s
most improved player as a sopho-
more, but another improvement went
unseen.

The change came in the work
ethic of the group, something that
Stagnitta says the group passed on to
its younger teammates.

“‘T think the younger guys got .

an idea of what a great work ethic is

and what it takes to achieve what the ba

seniors did,’’ he said.
As juniors, they had their best
campaign, going 11-4 and reaching

off the ball,’’ said Roberts, who fin-
ished his career with 98 goals. ‘“That
made it tough for us to get the ball
and work it around. They lost their
legs in the second half, though, and
we were able to run by them.”’

VMI’s first half defense was
anchored by senior goalie Matt Ott,
who entered the game ranked fifth in
Division I with a .688 save percent-
age. Ott made six first half saves and
shut W&L out for the first 17 minutes
while his Keydets held the first half
lead.

“All year long, our strength
has been our goal tending,’’ said VMI
assistant coach David Hope. ‘‘Matt
Ott came up big like he has all sea-
son.”’

“Ott came out hot,’’ said

W&L head coach Jim Stagnitta, who
has never lost to VMI. ‘‘He made us
change some shots, but we also
missed some pretty easy shots. We
had our opportunities, but we were a
little nervous.”’

The Generals settled down at

halftime and claimed a brief lead on
back-to-back goals by freshman
attackman Andy Dutton and senior
midfielder Drew Anton. The Keydets,
though, answered the W&L charge
with back-to-back goals of their own
from junior midfielder Spencer Gill
and senior midfielder Richard Owens
to take a 5-4 lead, their last lead of
the game.

Junior midfielder David
Schiminger scored just 20 seconds
after Owens’ goal to tie the game at
5-5, and junior midfielder John Hunt-
er scored 18 seconds later to give
WAL the lead for good with 4:43 left
in the third quarter.

The Generals were able to
keep their momentum because faceoff
specialist Derek Hutton, a junior, kept
winning faceoffs. He won 13 of the
18 he took, including seven of eight
at one point, and scored just 12 sec-
onds into the fourth quarter after
winning the draw.

Faculty vote kills CRC, speech code

 

By LEIGH ALLEN
Phi News Editor

The Washington and Lee faculty late Tues-
day voted to eliminate the controversial
Confidential Review Committee in favor of a
judicial system that could not punish students
for verbal harassment.

Under an amended proposal submitted by
the Student Affairs Committee in April, mat-
ters of physical sexual misconduct will be
heard by a Student-Faculty Hearing Board
whose procedures will be similar to the CRC.

But complaints of verbal harassment would
be handled “in personal and informal ways, not
by formal and judicial procedures,” according
to the amendment approved Tuesday.

Religion Professor Louis Hodges, who
suggested that amendment, said the CRC’s

previous policy had the potential for creating
an undesirable speech code.

“There is no need for the university to
have a disciplinary body to sit in a position of
punishing speech,” Hodges said. “It’s better to
risk injurious speech than it is to curtail free-
dom of inquiry.”

According to the new proposal, Dean of
Students David Howison will have broad
discretion in handling verbal harassment.

For example, Howison said he would con-
sider taking extreme cases of harassment to the
Student Conduct Committee if they could not
be handled informally.

Howison said in less serious cases he would
consider other options, such as counseling or
referring the case to a faculty member to help
resolve the dispute. But Howison said he can-
not suspend or expel a student.

“My primary concern was that the faculty
approve a policy that students respect and feel
is reasonable,” Howison said. “I think we’ ve
achieved that.”

A new Student-Faculty Hearing Board
will include four students appointed by the
Executive Committee and four faculty mem-
bers appointed by the Dean of the College,
according to the new policy. Like the CRC, the
board will hear confidential cases of physical
sexual misconduct that occur between students.

Six of the eight members of the board
must vote to convict, and punishment can range
from counseling to dismissal.

Howison said about 60 percent of the
faculty members voting Tuesday supported
the amended SAC proposal.

after the CRC's self-study in March. In that

study, the CRC claimed the authority to sus-
pend or dismiss students who verbally ha-
rassed members of the W&L community.

Religion Profes-
sor Alexandra Brown,
who served on the
CRC for two years and
participated in the self-
study, said she believes
the CRC served an
important role in stu-
dent discipline.

Students who
have been veroally ha-
rassed may be reluc-
tantto participate in informal mediation, Brown
said, if they know there is no committee to
hear their case if mediation fails.

Students “need a body designed specifi-

Hodges

cally to handle more sensitive cases,” she said.

A recent survey indicated less than one-
third of undergraduates knew what the role of
the CRC was. That lack of understanding was
partly responsible for the faculty’s decision,
Hodges said.

“The administration did a very poor job
explaining to the student body what the com-
mittee was about and how it proceeded,”
Hodges said. “Students feared the unknown.”

Geology Professor Samuel Kozak, who
chaired the committee that formed the CRC in
1987, said only two cases were ever heard by
the CRC. That small number also indicates
many students didn’t understand the purpose
of the committee, he said.

“The CRC was controversial from the
beginning,” Kozak said. “People were criticiz-
ing it before it even met for the first time.”

The Executive Committee
would investigate cases of rape as
possible honor violations, EC mem-
bers said.

EC Junior Rep. and President-
elect Josh MacFarland said a report
of rape would be handled like any
other alleged honor violation.

“The most discussion would
occur after the investigation.” Mac-
Farland said. “If a majority of the
EC felt it needed to be brought to
closed trial it would be.”

MacFarland, however, said he
doesn’ t think most students are will-
ing to deal with rape cases.

“I don’t think Pm qualified to
handle cases of sexual assault.”
MacFarland said. “But if someone
thought their honor was violated
and someone was being dishonor-
able we would certainly hear the
case.”

Senior EC Rep. Nancy Mitchell
said the White Book is not specific
in its statement of what constitutes
an honor violation.

“One of the reasons we don’t
have anything more specific other
than lie, cheat or steal is because
honor is hard to define,” she said.

EC Sophomore Rep. and Vice
President-elect Ames Hutton said
he had not thought about the

tion of an honor violation is lying,
cheating and stealing,” Hutton said,
“Tbut] the White Book holds stu-
dents to honorable conduct.”

Hutton believes rape could be
considered a form of stealing.

“It’s a theft of someone else’s
body,” he said.

The bottom line, Mitchell said,
is that all reports of dishonorable
conduct given to the EC will be
investigated.

“Rape certainly isn’t honor-
able,” Mitchell said. “Dishonor is
dishonor.

“People know what it means to
be dishonorable. Or at least they
should.”

Nevertheless, Mitchell and
MacFarlaiid said a different group
should handle sexual assault cases.
The faculty on Tuesday approved
the creation of such a committee , to
consist of students and faculty,

“Older people’s input is valu-
able in these situations,”
MacFarland said.

“There are women on this cam-
pus who would not be comfortable
going to their peers, even elected
peers [with a rape case],’” Mitchell
said. “But if a woman felt the EC
was the appropriate body, then we
would investigate.”

said. “More on production, bigger name speakers

Darden said the university’s Business Office led
him to believe the 1992 convention had a net excess

greater than any past convention.

$32,000. Darden gave the EC $14,000 to reimburse

Cadets heckle police after fight at Beta

 

By GREG PATTERSON
Phi Assistant News Editor

 

Virginia Military Institute cadets yelled at
and spit on police and Washington and Lee
security officers when they went to question a
cadet about a fight at Beta Theta Pi.

Three cadets were arrested --- two for
failure to obey a police officer and one for
being drunk in public --- following the fight.

The fight broke out at Beta around mid-
night when about a dozen cadets began
slamdancing in the middle of a band party,
running into other party guests.

Some members of Beta asked the cadets
to leave. The cadets agreed and were led to the
door opening onto Jefferson Street.

But as they reached the door, one cadet
turned around, said “Fuck this” and punched a
Beta walking beside him.

As the fight intensified, the cadets ringed

the outside door. The cadets facing out the
door fought people on the outside while cadets
inside the door fought people inside.

Soon the fight moved to the middle of
Jefferson Street, where pushing occurred, but
not many punches were thrown.

WA&L Security Officer Thomas “Baner”
Bane said he was working at Phi Delta Theta
when a Beta told him about the fight.

Bane said the fight was already in the
street when he arrived.

“I came up and asked what was going on
and they all ran [toward VMI],” he said.

Bane and Lexington police, who had ar-
rived, chased the cadets up Letcher Street
Bane said the police caught two cadets, David
Youngclus and Brian Darin, before they
reached the VMI barracks

Bane said he and police then went into the
barracks to arrest a cadet he had recognized

As Bane and the officers left the barracks

with Cadet William Butler, Bane said, about
300 cadets lined the second-floor walkway,
called “the stoop,” around the building.

Lexington Police Lt. $.E. Crowder said
cadets began to chant “Hell no, we won't go”
as police brought Butler out. Cadets spat on
police and threw fruit, cans, smoke bombs and
firecrackers at them.

VMI Public Information Officer Thomas
Joynes said the cadets were provoked when a
officer who entered the barracks drew his gun
after being surrounded by angry cadets.

Joynes said another officer ordered the
first officer to put his gun away.

Beard said the officer's action was justi-
fied. “They were scared of the mob that was
developing,” he said.

Police said two Beta members were treated
at Stonewall Jackson Hospital and released

Che Ring-tum Phi

Founded September 18, 1897

What's happened
to the old VMI?

Back in the 50s and 60s, VMI cadets would march down
Jefferson Street on their way to church every Sunday morning.

Inevitably, they would pass in front of Red Square, where
fraternity men were waking up, shaking off the effects of the
previous night and wandering out to meet the day.

And what happened? Unlike at Beta Sunday, no one had to
call the police.

Instead, as the line of cadets passed the fraternity houses,
the less-religious cadets would dart inside to spend their day
of rest drinking with their Mink friends.

Yes, according to most alumni from that periodmany W&L
and VMI students were actually friends.

How things have changed.

What has happened since then? Maybe Washington and
Lee has changed. Obviously, W&L has gone co-ed and now
attracts a more diverse student body. Some critics say General
Lee’s legacy has been forgotten. And while the social scene
is still dominated by fraternities, they have evolved with the
fraternity system nationally.

Nonetheless, W&L students are still dedicated to the same
standards of conduct that our predecessors maintained,

And our neighbors along the hill? Externally VMI doesn’t
seem much different: same impressive history, same
forbidding walls, same stuffy uniforms and same group of
clean-cut, perfectly postured young Virginia men.

All those young Virginians may look the same, but their
attitudes toward their W&L neighbors seem to have changed.

Recently, a Lexington defense attorney noted that he has
seen more VMI cadets in trouble with the law in the past
three years than in the previous 27.

No one ever accused W&L students of being model
Lexingtonians. However, we don’t recall W&L students
spitting on police officers any time recently.

Baner has suggested that fraternities either keep guest lists
or bar cadets from their parties. Guest lists are unwieldy and
antithetical to the sense of community W&L tries to maintain.

On the other hand, this isn’t the 50s or the 60s; cadets are
no longer part of the W&L community. They seem to like
getting drunk, trying to pick up women and starting fights, but
they don’t seem to enjoy being friendly.

We hate to judge any group on the actions of a few of its
members, but considering W&L’s experiences with cadets this
year, you have to ask how much their company is worth.

Thanks, faculty

The faculty’s elimination of the CRC comes as a welcome
relief to those of us who have regretted the general trend of
faculty and administration encroachment upon student affairs.

At the least, its action was a realistic way to rid W&L of
a dangerous and embarrassing institution. But more
importantly, it shows that the faculty has confidence in
students to exhibit proper behavior while at W&L — and to
face our mistakes when we do not.

As Dean Howison said, this is a student proposal, and it is
one of which we can be proud. But we cannot forget that with
the privilege of being W&L students comes a responsibility
that goes beyond speech codes and explicitly defined rules.

The faculty says it believes we can live up to the promise
of civil and decent behavior that we made by choosing W&L.

It is up to us to prove them right.

Quote of the Week

What we need is a community where everyone is happy ...
and flourishes.

— Associate Professor of Law Joan Shaughnessy on the
faculty’s vote to kill the CRC. (Go figure.)

Let IT Ripe

By Chris Swann

I just wrenched my ankle nearly off my foot, and my
girlfriend supplied me with a number of painkillers, which
I gratefully ingested, so if I ramble a bit, forgive me. I’m in
a sort of hazy twilight right now --- I’m not sure if it’s
actually dark outside (it’s 9 pm) or if my brain just wants it
to be so. I could talk about anything in this state. I think I'll
talk about spiders.

There was a large orange spider in my girlfriend’s
bathroom today. She picked up my docksider shoe and
marched into the bathroom, ending its small, hairy life with
a brutal smack. Only it disappeared --- the smushed arachnid
was not on the floor where she had killed it five minutes
later. I’d like to think it underwent a kind of material
conversion into spiritual matter before it took off for the
great big web in the sky. My girlfriend is convinced it was
resurrected and is now lurking somewhere above the shower.

Spiders are such benevolent creatures. Oh sure, black
widows suck, but really --- they eat annoying bugs, spin
pretty little webs which inspired lots of neat metaphysical
poetry in England, and gave us Spiderman. (Excuse me, I
need another ibuprofen --- 600mg. Gulp. Much better.)

Where would our children be without Spiderman?
He’s such a nice, witty, caring superhero. Thank God for
spiders and radiation --- why, we'd have to deal with stupid
evil people like Doctor Octopus. For the record, I’d like to
clarify just what kind of a doctor old Ock really is. I doubt
he’s a pediatrician,

My VIEw

By John Ryle Lawson ITI, '89

U.S.A; March 12, 2009

CHARLES: Honey, I think we
should have another kid.

ZITA: Well, I'd like to, but pro-
viding for a child is expensive. Be-
sides, we already have 17 kids as it is.

CHARLES: But Zita, you know
that money is no concern. The
Children’s Nutrition Act insures that
every child whose parents are unable
to comfortably provide for him shall
receive a food stipend from the gov-
ernment.

ZITA: How could I forget!

CHARLES: I haven’t forgotten
the Childcare At Taxpayers’ Expense
Act. With it, we don’t need to worry
about raising an additional child.

ZITA: Well, if we have another
kid, it will be nice to know that wehave
the option of free childcare. However,
I might want to take advantage of the
Family Leave Act. I'd like to spend
some time with the kids, andthe Leave
Act guarantees me thirty-six months.

CHARLES: Honey, I don’t think
your boss can afford to lose you for
thirty-six days. Do you think he’ ll want
you out for three years?

ZITA: What my boss has to say
about all of this is neither here nor
there. I have a legal right to keep my

 

job and spend time with my family,
and, dammit, I’m going to take advan-
tage of it.

CHARLES: Well, we know we
won’t have to worry about school.
Now that higher education is com-

pletely paid for by the government, we :

don’t have to shell out a cent to get a
complete education for our small army
of children.

ZITA: What are we waiting for -
-- let’s head for the bedroom. We’ve
got a baby to make!

CHARLES: Before we go, I'd
like to talk about what we’re going to
do about your mother. She’s gotten to
the point where she really needs some-
one to look after her. Also, she doesn’t
have enough money for all her health
bills.

ZITA: Well, I think we would be
wise to postpone this discussion until
we know what Congress does with the
president’s AARP bill. If the bill passes,
Mom will get enough money to hire a
nurse and pay her doctor bills.

CHARLES: That would be great.
With all the money we’d save, I could
buy some jet skis. I’d also be able to
buy those $750 running shoes I’ve had
my eye on.

ZITA: Yeah, and we could also
buy self-discipline counseling for all
of the kids. The counselors usually
charge $550 per child, but, because we

have so many, they’Il give us a group
rate of $525 per child.

CHARLES: Then it’s agreed ---
if the AARP bill passes, we won’t take
care of your mom or have her live with
us.

ZITA: Well, withallof this settled,
I think it’s time to hit the sack.

(Child #11 runs into the room)

OTTO: Mon, Dad, the president
just came on TV and said that the
budget is really messed up and the
government doesn’t have any money.
Then he said that people are going to
have to start paying for things them-
selves.

CHARLES: Pay for things your-
self! That’s ridiculous! The president
must be drunk!

ZITA: It’s not only ridiculous,
it’s unfair! What if you need money?
What about a family like us? How are
we going to feed nearly twenty chil-
dren?

CHARLES: What about the
farmers and the homeless? What about
the social workers and those work-
horses at the United States Postal Ser-
vice? What about the needy, the handi-
capped and our nation’s children?
What about the panhandlers and the
people who'd like to have socialized
health care? What about the old people?
What about space telescopes and the
IRS? What about education for the

 

LETTERS

rapists and murderers? What about the
people who do drugs all the time? The
government must cover these ex-
penses!

There’s only one solution. The
government should call out the army
and send troops tocollect lots of money
from people-who have more than they
need

ZITA: I agree. Especially when
there are people like Hank Bryant
around. He makes more than $100,000
ayear, and he has no family. He doesn’t
need all the money he earns. Plenty of
people need his money more than he
does. Why don’t they put a great big
tax on people like him?

CHARLES: Really. It would only
be fair. There are so many people who
need that money more thin a person
like Hank needs it.

ZITA: It would make much more
sense. Hank works about 60 hours a
week. He doesn’t have time to spend
that much money.

CHARLES: It’s more logical. It’s
amatter of social responsibility. When
you’re someone who makes what Hank
Bryant makes, you owe it to society to
put in your fair share during a time of
economic crisis.

Law dean sets
facts straight

To the Editor:

I have no doubt that the issue of gender-
neutral language, upon which you recently edi-
torialized, is a legitimate question for public
dialogue. But when we indulge in our increas-
ingly common habit of making individuals the
instruments of debate, as you did with my col-
league, Professor Gwen Handelman, it is incum-
bent upon us all to get the facts straight.

In the interest of doing so, and innot making
the facts stand in the way of a good argument, let
me explain precisely what Professor Handelman
did, In the course of her tax ethics seminar, she
required the students to undertake a series of
drafting assignments, drawing on regulatory lan-
guage dealing with Department of the Treasury
rules and the American Bar Association’s Model
Rules of Professional Conduct (both of which
now employ gender-neutral language). It is the
common, if not the unanimous, convention of
state governments, the federal government, and
other major drafting organizations, as well as the
American Bar Association, that statutory and
regulatory materials be drafted with gender-
neutral terminology. Doing so does not require
linguistic gymnastics, rejection of the rules of
grammar, or silly word constructions; neither
did Professor Handelman. Instead, she insisted
that the students follow the very conventions that
are widely accepted and required in the legisla-
tive and regulatory drafting context.

Sadly for those who would wish to use her
example as evidence in their own ideological

 

struggle, this is the long and short of it. There is no
ideology here, other than the ideology of following
the standard conventions of the legal system in the
training we give to students.

The characterization of Professor Handelman’s
conduct as a teacher, which your editorial rein-
forced, was quite frankly distorted. Disturbingly so
in fact. Indeed, I use that term with some care, and
in doing so indulge a presumption in favor of those
who characterized her conduct'and motives, just as
I would have hoped that they would have indulged
a similar presumption of regularity on Professor
Handelman’s part. As I said in my written response
to the (few) law students who sent mea letter raising
the issue, “You should exercise great caution before
attributing ideological or political motives to others,
and before using such words as ‘manipulated’ and
‘indoctrinate,’ when those quite serious allegations
are being directed at an identified individual in a
factual setting that clearly admits of another, much
more likely, and educationally reasonable interpre-
tation.”

Sincerely,

Randall P. Bezanson
Dean and Professor of Law

America's races
remain divided

To the Editor:
As Washington and Lee slept, wrapped in its

seemingly eternal spell of blissful harmony, the
nation’s cities erupted in a disturbing outbreak of
chaotic and brutal rioting.

We have all been forced by the shocking
footage of this exercise in mayhem to ask our-
selves what could have caused this unrest; specu-
lation abounds, answers do not.

The lesson we all ought to learn from this
tragedy is how little we really have progressed in
the last decades in resolving the racial obsession
that has always haunted our nation. We ought to
take a sober look at the reality we face as Ameri-
cans,

The sad truth is that despite superficial im-
provements in the American black’s position, he
fares little better today than he did before this
country resolved to rescue him from the predica-
ment its institutionalized racism placed him in.
Although white attitudes have changed so that
racism is no longer acceptable in the way it once
was, and the number of prominent American blacks
has risen, and other cosmetic improvements have
taken place, the American reality is that blacks still
largely languish in city ghettos scourged by crime,
drugs, broken families and poverty where the indi-
vidual is economically, mentally and spiritually
raped by the misery of hisenvironment. The Ameri-
can reality is a nation divided by race: rich and
poor, powerful and powerless. The American real-
ity is ugly. We still have a vast racial divide in this
country that, after a brief outpouring of concern,
Our government and society seem to have aban-
doned hope in closing. The recent tragedy is about
far more than a suspicious verdict; it's about an
America that is racially sick, and without sight of a
cure.

Missin

keyboard

costs Sigma Nu $750

 

By GREG PATTERSON
Phi Assistant News Editor

 

Sigma Nu must pay $750 to
replace a band’s keyboard and case
that were stolen at a February party,

In a trial last Thursday, Lex-
ington General District Court Judge
Joseph Savage said it was more likely
that a party guest took the equipment
than someone off the _ street.
Therefore, he said, Sigma Nu was
responsible for the loss.

“The fraternity has an obliga-
tion to control its members and
guests,’’ Savage said.

Members of the band Leggz
filed a warrant to have Sigma Nu
replace the Korg 600 keyboard and
case after it disappeared at a Feb. 14
party at the fraternity’s house.

Leggz leader Doug Settles told
the judge that after the party, fraterni-
ty members helped carry band equip-
ment from the basement of the house
to the front foyer and front porch so
it could be loaded on a truck.

Road crew members testified
that the keyboard was in the
basement, but could not be found

when the truck was loaded.

Former Sigma Nu president
Heath Dixon told the judge that the
band could not be sure the keyboard
was ever at the house. But the Leggz
keyboardist said he played it that
night.

Dixon said he interpreted the
band’s contract to mean the fraternity
was only responsible for the
equipment during the show and not
once the show was over.

Settles said the band’s contract
covers ‘‘from the time the door on
the truck goes up and we begin to
unload to when that door is closed.”’

He said Sigma Nu members did
not allow the road crew to search the
second floor of the fraternity house.

Dixon said the crew was not
allowed upstairs because people were
already asleep. However, he said,
officers searched the rooms the next
day and found nothing.

Judge Savage said Sigma Nu
would have 10 more days to find the
keyboard, but Dixon is not hopeful.

“‘We’ve looked and we don’t
have it,’’ Dixon said. ‘‘I guess we’ll

have to pay it.”’

Students resurrect literary society

 

By CRAIG BURKE
Phi Staff Reporter

On Wednesday, May 20, a long-dead tradition
at Washington and Lee University will be revived.
The Graham-Lee-Washington Society, the
only literary society to emerge at W&L in several
decades, will kick off with a dinner-debate at 7:30

, p.m. in Evan’s Dining Hall,

Sophomore Matt Jackson, founder of the new
society, said it will be a literary society much like
those that thrived at W&L in the 1800s.

The history of W&L includes several literary
societies, two of which were the Graham-Lee
Society and the Washington Society.

Both were established in the early 19th
century and were crucial aspects of the social and
intellectual scene at W&L before the arrival of
fraternities.

Jackson and . ior Cameron Humphries are

 

Law graduation Sunday

the co-heads of the Society’s Student Executive
Board.

Once he decided to proceed with his plan for
a literary society, Jackson said the decision to
include Humphries was an easy one.

“I wanted to be open to all ideologies,’’
Jackson said. ‘‘Cameron was the natural choice,
because his views are often perceived as the an-
tithesis of mine.’’

With the help of Dean of Students David
Howison, Jackson and Humphries asked several
students to become members of the Society’s
Executive Board.

The idea was to choose people who represent-
ed many facets of student life, Jackson said.

“We wanted outspoken students who could
cultivate an interest in the Graham-Lee-Washington
Society,’ he said.

Members include students involved in the
Women’s Forum, the Minority Students Associa-

tion, University Theater and several other activities.

Freshman Kim Herring said she was interest-
ed in reviving something that used to be important
to W&L students.

“‘The Society will be an intellectual outlet for
the W&L community,’’ she said. ‘‘I hope it can
become a prominent part of the University.”’

Wednesday’s debate will focus on the issue of
public figures and their right to privacy.

That idea came after Arthur Ashe’s admission
that he has AIDS and after the uproar over an
article on the Hudnall rape trial that ran in The
Ring-tum Phi, Jackson said.

If the debate is successful, Jackson said he
hopes the Society will sponsor events every six
to eight weeks next year.

“‘We’d like to sponsor a variety of activi-
ties,’’ Jackson said. ‘‘Maybe a symposium or a
show on Channel Nine; anything that will foster
aggressive discussion.”’

After disappearing for a year,
Spring Fest will return to Washington

the Maury and a reggae concert.

The Interfraternity Council,
Panhellenic Council, Minority Stu-

“It’s a good chance for the
whole school to get together,”’ said

IFC President Sam Rock.

The IFC obtained permission
from the city to use the river for the

race, a new Spring Fest event. Each
home-made raft will carry four peo-
ple. Rafts will be placed in the water
3/4 of a mile upstream from the sew-
age treatment plant and taken out at
the alcove next to the plant, according
to Rock.

There is a $20 entry fee for
each raft. Proceeds will be donated to

most creatively decorated raft.

At about 2 p.m. the reggae band
New Determination will begin playing

‘Fraternity presidents voted for

Cross said Spring Fest was not

organizational difficulties.

‘“Everyone started working on it

Marijuana and alcohol use
pose equally serious risks

hol? If marijuana is not any more dangerous
than alcohol, why not make it legal?

AF Surprisingly, although marijuana has been
* known as a recreational substance virtually
throughout history there is little good data-

based knowledge on this drug.

Research has been mostly shut down for at least a
decade due to public attitudes.

The research done in the 60s and 70s on pot may be
obsolete now because the marijuana of today is about 30
times stronger than what folks were using back when
the Beatles were sing-

unexpectedly.
A good job could go down the tubes.
Marijuana usage has been demonstrated to lower

count in men by up to 70 percent, reduce testosterone
levels in men (but raise them in women) and negatively
affect the ability to store and process information.

A joint has about 10 times the tar of a tobacco
cigarette.

On the other hand, heavy alcohol consumption
(and not necessarily alcoholism) is associated with a
whole lot of bad stuff including brain and liver damage,
strokes, increased blood pressure and cancer.

However, light to moderate use of alcohol may
actually reduce heart disease to some extent.

About 90 percent of the people who use alcohol

will enjoy the experi-

 

ing about Lucy in the
sky.

A 1967 joint con-
tained about .05 percent

tive consequences, but
10 percent will have
problems.

The truth is that if
you have smoked a few
joints, aside from the
major legal hassles you
could have become em-

 

much higher levels of
THC haven’t been care-
fully evaluated scientifically.

Neither alcohol nor pot are benign drugs.

Each has its risks.

To my knowledge, no one has died directly from an
overdose of marijuana, whereas about 50 percent of the
adult population will die if they achieve a blood-alcohol
level of 0.45 percent.

On the other hand, a study using a road-side sobri-
ety test showed that 94 percent of those who had smoked
pot 1 1/2 hours earlier failed.

The testers waited until 2 1/2 hours had
passed and 61 percent still failed, indicating
that grass can significantly impair your abil-
ity to drive and will definitely increase your
likelihood of a fatal accident if you drive
while stoned.

Alcohol is water-soluble and leaves
the body relatively quickly, usually within a
period of hours.

Pot is not water soluble and is stored in fat
cells for a considerably longer period of time, possibly
indefinitely.

As drug testing becomes more sophisticated, these
residual traces of pot-smoking could come back on you

  

broiled in if caught, you
probably have not done
yourself any serious damage.

I’m obviously not advocating pot use, I’m simply
saying that a few experimental hits from a bong is not
going to shrivel your brain and automatically tum you
into a crack addict.

Having said that, I will also say there is strong
justification for not legalizing marijuana, and anyone
contemplating experimentation should consider not only
the legal risks.

They should also be aware that it is not a benign
drug.
It can cause dependency; it can sap
your motivational resources; it has medical
risks; and it can be a gateway drug to other
more harmful substances.
The question of whether it is no more
dangerous than alcohol misses the point.
Both have dangers - medical, psy-
chological and legal.

It is in your best interest to know the risks
before you make a decision about whether or not to use
(or continue using).

Freshman Marilyn Baker uncorks another backhand during practice
this week. Baker is preparing for the Divison Ill individual tournament
beginning this weekend. Baker Is only the second W&L women’s
tennis player to make the tournament her freshman year. The first
was Jean Stroman, '91.

Phi Sports Editor

 

She is having the best spring
season that no one knows about.

Marilyn Baker is a freshman
from Baldwin, N.Y. She’s been play-
ing tennis for six years, a relatively
short time for this sport. She joined
the W&L women’s tennis team this
past fall and started at number three
singles.

She worked hard during the
winter months and took over the
number one spot this spring.

She lost one dual match all year
and finished third at the ODAC tour-
nament. Her overall record stands at
19-3, and this Friday she will join
Jean Stroman as the only two W&L
women’s tennis players to e the
Division III individual tournament as
freshmen.

Baker will travel to Kalamazoo,
Michigan and begin play on Saturday,
May 16. Baker joins senior Richard
Yates as the only two W&L players
to make the postseason tournaments.

Baker’s success has also paid

off for her on the national tennis
scene.

“This is the first time I’ve ever
been a nationally ranked player,’’ said
Baker. She currently stands at 138th
in the nation in the 18 and under divi-
sion. Not bad for only six years on
the job.

Nevertheless, Baker says this
doesn’t mean she’ll put undue pres-
sure on herself to win the Division III
tournament.

‘“‘My goal is to play the best
that I can. If I give one hundred per-
cent I’ll be happy, with whatever
happens.”’

Women’s tennis head coach
Cinda Rankin is optimistic about
Baker’s chances, but says she has
already fulfilled all her expectations.

‘Just the fact that a freshman
makes it meets all expectations. I’d
love to see her win, but it’s not ex-
pected of her.’’

Baker feels the lack of expec-
tations takes some of the pressure off
and makes her feel more excited than
nervous,

“I’m excited not nervous. I

Women’s lax loses five talented seniors

think it’s because it’s the first time
and there are no expectations.”’

No matter how Baker does this
weekend, she’s had a season to re-
member. Rankin attributes Baker’s
success to the adjustments she made
over the winter to college tennis.

‘*She’s improved a lot since last
fall. She lost some early challenge
matches to [Mary] Nabers and
{Genia] Foster. She had to make
adjustments. I don’t think she knew
what to expect from college tennis.
She wasn’t challenged in high school
like she is here.”

Rankin also feels Baker’s dedi-
cation to the sport has been key to
her success. This dedication, she says,
has earned Baker the respect of her
teammates and a leadership role on
the team.

“*She is now a definite leader by
example. She has the respect of her
teammates because they know how
dedicated she is. In fact, the team
voted her the Most Dedicated.’’ Bak-
er received the honor Wednesday
night.

Baker doesn’t shy away from

the role of leader. In fact, she enjoys
the position.

“T think I’m a leader. I like to
help the other girls out with their
games, and I think they like to hear
my advice.’’

Baker gained the respect of
teammates and the number one posi-
tion by playing a solid, all-around
game. But she feels that her two-
fisted backhand and her speed are the
two weapons she relies on most.

Rankin says another strong
quality is Baker’s ability to change
her game during a match.

‘*She has the ability to adapt her
game in the middle of a match. She’s
able to analyze her opponent and
change her game to exploit their
weaknesses.”’

Baker’s going to need all her
skills to be in fine working order this
weekend as she takes on the best
Division III has to offer. But no mat-
ter what the results are, she’s had a
successful first year, and will con-
tinue to have success because she has
a zest for the game. As she put it:

“T love tennis!”’

It was a bitter-sweet ending for the Washington
and Lee women’s lacrosse team.

A little more than two weeks ago, the women
captured their first Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championship. In the process, they
shattered the jinx of the Roanoke Maroons.

The game marked the end of an era for the
program, though.

The Generals will lose five top players this
June as: Kimberly Bishop, Jennifer Donaldson,
Whitney Hopkins, Melissa Manko and Julie Vennes
all graduate. They leave a void that head coach
Janine Hathorn feels is going to be hard to fill.

‘“‘They were the first class of so much talent
that they changed the program,”’ said Hathorn.
‘Their dedication level set them apart; and their
leadership is going to be hard to replace.”’

For the five seniors, this last year was the most
successful, with the ultimate highlight being the
win over Roanoke in the ODAC finals.

“It was the highlight of all four years,”’ said
Manko. ‘‘The win made it all worth it.”’

‘After playing for five months, it all paid off,”’
said Bishop. ‘‘We finally did it. It was definitely
the climax.”’

When the five came in four years ago the
program was in its infancy. Hathorn said they

helped the program grow and just got better doing
it.

“‘As a whole, they caught on quickly to the
idea that with a certain amount of concentrated
hard work the program could grow quickly. Over
the years, the program did, and they grew a lot as
players. They’ve come a long way.”’

This year it all came together, and Vennes
believes that’s because the team had the right
combination of players.

‘We had better chemistry this year,”’ she said,
“‘we were more together as a team. A lot of good
freshmen helped us skill wise.’’

Experience also played a major part in the
team’s success.

““Experience,’’ said Donaldson. ‘‘We were
getting better each year, but experience teaches you
more than anything.”’

All five agreed, not surprisingly, that the
winning helped make this year fun.

“‘We had fun this year,’’ said Hopkins. ‘‘we
were winning more, and when you’re winning,
you’re always having a good time.”’

Hathorn said the success came because the girls
improved in all areas since freshman year. She said
each one got better year-to-year.

‘‘Whitney[Hopkins] came in with the best
experience level. She’s a very intense competitor,
and she’s grown in the finer points of the game.

“‘Kim[Bishop] came on strongest right from

freshman year. She has grown into a very advanced
lacrosse player.

“‘When I saw Melissa[Manko] and
Julie[Vennes], I knew they were going to be good
players. They had good skills and were very
competitive. they were great role players.

“‘Jen{Donaldson] improved the most. When she
came in she had never played before, and she
stepped right into goal. I have a lot of respect for
her because she stepped into goal.”’

Hathorn said the team might not have
accomplished all it did if not for the consistent play
of these five.

Bishop, who finishes as the Generals all-time
leader in goals (122) and points (156), summed it
up for all five when she said the friendships will be
the toughest part to leave.

“I’ve been together with a great group of girls,
it’s like having 20 big and little sisters. So, leaving
the friendships will be the most depressing thing.”’

Hathorn said she will miss the group’s intensity
and thanked them for their contributions to the

program.

“They have this incredible knack for being fun
to coach. But get them on the field, I wouldn’t
want to play against them. They were all intense
competitors.”

“This was their team. I thank them a lot for
all the things they’ve done for us.’’

Statons Falls accident

A W&L freshman died Monday after-
noon after falling over the edge of Statons
Falls in Amherst County.

Lisa Anne
Corwin, 19, of
Olympia,
Wash., was pro-
nounced dead at
the scene about
5:30 p.m. Mon-
day. She had
spent the after-
noon swim-
ming and pic-
nicking at the
falls with three
friends.

Freshmen
R.H. Powell, Heather Loveland and Dou-
glas Boyles were at the falls with Corwin
preparing to leave when they noticed Corwin
was missing.

Powell said the three students then
looked over the edge of the falls and saw
Corwin sliding down the falls into a pool at
the bottom.

Powell said none of the group saw or
heard Corwin fall over the edge.

Powell said he ran to the nearest house
to get help while Boyles and Loveland
climbed down to the pool and tried to find
Corwin, who was trapped under the water.

The Pedlar Rescue Squad arrived first
and pulled Corwin’s body from the water at
5:30 p.m.

The body was taken to Virginia Bap-
tist Hospital in Lynchburg. An autopsy is
being performed to determine the cause of
death,

Statons Falls is 17 miles east of Lexing-
ton in the George Washington National For-
est, A large flat rock at the top of the falls
looks over a 50 foot almost-vertical drop
down to a series of shallow pools.

“The falls are really quite dangerous,”
said Duval Doss, investi-
gator for the Amherst
County Sheriff's Depart-
ment.

“With all the rain
we've had, there is a lot
more water moving over
them, It’s just a tragic ac-
cident,”

Doss said an investi-
gation of the death is con-
tinuing, but that it has al-
ready been ruled an acci-

“We have no reason
to believe this is anything
other than a tragic acci-
dent,” he said.

The university is
planning a memorial ser-
vice for Corwin before the
end of the year.

“The university com-
munity is saddened by this
terrible tragedy,” Univer-
sity President John Wil-
son said Tuesday.

“Lisa Corwin was a
fine young woman and we
truly grieve for her family
and friends.”

Corwin was the
daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

 

Alan Corwin of Olympia, Wash. Her father
is a member of the Washington and Lee
class of 1962.

W&Lcommunity mourns loss of Lisa Corwin

Friends and professors say that her en-
thusiasm and sincere dedication to W&L
will be missed.

Despite only being a freshman, Corwin
was involved in Young Democrats, the
Washington State Mock Convention Dele-
gation and Hillel, the
Jewish students’ organi-
zation. She also played
clarinet in the University
Wind Ensemble and was
a member of the club
softball team.

Jones said he and Corwin enjoyed tak-
ing walks and sitting together on the roof of
his fraternity house, Lambda Chi Alpha.

Jones said she was close to both of her
parents, who kept up with her progress at
school.

Jones said Associate Director of Pro-
grams Mimi Elrod even noticed that Corwin
was involved in many activities and wrote
Corwin’s parents to tell them how well she
was doing.

Jones said she was part of a tight-knit
group of friends that included the girls she
planned to room with next year.

“She was never without her room-
mates,” Jones said. “They always came [to
Lambda Chi] together.”

Crockett, one of Corwin’s professors,
said she was an outstanding student.

“She was always prepared and never
missed a class,” Crockett said. “She was the
kind of student a professor dreams about.”

This year Corwin won the Jim Stump
Prize, an award given to an outstanding
freshman or sophomore in the German de-
partment

“Lisa came to W&L with so much tal-
ent in German that she tested into the 300-
level literature classes,” Crockett said. He

Next year, Tear Night will no longer be the drunken
orgiastic celebration that traditionally caps fraternity Rush.
Or at least not if the Interfraternity Council has its way.

A proposal for an alcohol-free Tear period was ap-
proved 8-6 at Wednesday night’s IFC meeting. It would
require that all bids be accepted from 5 to 8 p.m. during the
last Friday of Rush.

“Instead of letting people have the option of tearing
from 8 p.m. until the party ends, all bids will be accepted at
the same time,” IFC Vice-President Tom Washmon said.

He said the new format will separate the act of tearing
from drinking and will also allow varsity athletes to tear
with everyone else.

Washmon said the way each fraternity handles the Tear
period may differ.

“Tt will be up to each house to decide on a Tear Night
format,” he said, “That could be a sit-down dinner, a formal
or whatever.”

The goal of the new format is to take the focus off
drinking, Washmon said.

He also said there has been increasing concern from the
Hill over Tear Night-related injuries.

“There are consistently more injuries on Tear week-
ends,” Washmon said. “Obviously that points to Tear Night
as being a little overly rambunctious.”

Dean of Students David Howison said the number of
injuries during the last Tear Night made it necessary to
improve next year’s ceremonies.

“Some of the activities during the last Tear Night were
clearly dangerous,” Howison said. “I made a statement at

 

 

Class of '96 filled

with brains and brawn

the time that much of Tear Night was unacceptable and

to curtail Tear Night

didn’t contribute to the fraternity system.”

Though Howison made his opinion of Tear Night
clear, he said it was up to the IFC and other fraternity leaders
to initiate the changes.

Associate Dean of Students for Greek Affairs Leroy C.
“Buddy” Atkins said Tear Night was one of the priority
items for consideration on a list composed by former IFC
President Greg Hicks.

“Since the new IFC Board would be the ones dealing
with Rush, Hicks left Tear Night to them,” Atkins said.

The process of creating new Tear Night procedures
fell to Washmon, Atkins said.

Ideas were gathered from the IFC, the presidents of
fraternities and Rush chairmen.

“Tt’s always been up to the students to pull this off,”
Howison said.

But some think changing Tear Night is a mistake.

Sigma Nu President Mark VanDeusen said the new
format will. have little effect on Tear Night injuries.

“T think students will drink in the afternoon before they
tear, or they'll drink even more that night,” he said.

Kappa Alpha President Hank Huff disagrees.

“Something needed to be done to diminish the number
of Tear Night injuries,” Huff said.

The proposal is also likely to include a provision for
moving band parties to the last Friday of Rush, instead of
the last Saturday.

Several students suggested an IFC-sponsored event on
Saturday night in which all fraternities would participate.

Fraternities must vote again at next week’s IFC meet-
ing for the proposal to pass.

“The members of fraternities need to ask themselves if
the kind of dangerous activities at previous Tear Nights are
something they want to be involved in,” Howison said.

According to

48 were presidents of

The one considerable change from
last year’s applicant pool seems to be
in athletics: 149 members of the class
of 1996 were team captains in high
school, up from 91 last year.

While each incoming class over
the past five years has been strong,
Kozak said, the quality of the best
students who choose W&L has been
improving.

“We’re definitely improving at
the top,” she said, citing an increase in
the number of applicants for Honor
Scholarships. Overall, the admissions
office received 3,433 applications this
year,

Some administrators and faculty
members agree that there is an upward
trend in the academic quality of the
students coming to W&L.

“The trend is definitely upward in
terms of both academic qualities and

personal qualities,” said Mimi Elrod,
associate director of special programs
and former associate director of admis-
sions. “The students are not just get-
ting brighter, but are also more in-
volved.”

Professor of Journalism John
Jennings said students are coming bet-
ter prepared for college work. Ac-
cording to Jennings, the average grade
in his Journalism 301 course, Law and
Communications, has gradually im-
proved from a C+ in 1986 to a B- last

“The quality of written work is

A Funny Thing’s happening at Lenfest

Modern musical farce borrows from Plautus

 

By NICOLE KEELER
Phi Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee theatre will
present A Funny Thing Happened on
the Way to the Forum, a Steven
Sondheim musical and winner of the
1962 Tony Award, from May 22 until
May 27 in the Lenfest Center.

The play is amodern musical farce
adapted from the popular comedies of
the ancient Roman playwright, Titus
Maccius Plautus, director Al Gordon
said.

“Forum borrows most heavily, but
by no means exclusively, from the
Plautus play Pseudolus,” Gordon said.

He said the plot of Pseudolus was
a common one in Plautus’ time be-
cause it was one the rowdy Roman
audiences always enjoyed. The story
follows a young and inexperienced boy
from a good family who falls in love
with a naive, yet socially unacceptable

girl. Confused, the boy tums to one of
his family’s crafty slaves to help trick
his parents into giving their consent to
the match.

just singing, [Forum] is a lot lighter,

Gordon said he decided to bring
Forum to the Lenfest Center because
“we try to do different types of theatre-
like a Roman-style musical.”

He also pointed out that Forum is
a nice contrast to last year’s popular
production of Evita.

“It was very serious, almost an
opera. There was no speaking in Evita,

   

funnier,” Gordon said. 4

Gordon said, he tried to emphasize the
Roman quality first and then introduce
color and anachronistic touches that he
said associates them with the continu-

efforts.

“They’re responsible for all ele-
ments of production except costume.
Two or three of them are in the show
itself,” Gordon said. “The cast is made
entirely of students, with the exception
of one alum.”

According to Gordon, production
is going smoothly and “the crew is
having a blast.”

Gordon said the first two nights of
Forum are virtually sold out and tick-

ets are going fast for the other four
shows.

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, May 21, 1992

 

 

 

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Founded September 18, 1897

To the trustees:
You can trust us

The Board of Trustees is meeting this weekend to approve
the budget for the coming year. We planned to preview the
meeting, but the story was only about five inches long. We
would have headlined it, ‘“Trustees to meet.’’ Not very
exciting.

In other words, they wouldn’t tell us anything.

As a private university, Washington and Lee is not required
to release its budget. But considering that W&L students pay
more than $11,000 each in tuition every year, it does not seem
too much to ask that the Board make its budget open to
parents and students.

Students have a stake in how the university spends its
money. They deserve to know what they’re getting.

Don’t get us wrong. We are not trying to raise the question
of whether the Board is handling our money properly. We
simply don’t know why they are reluctant to share such
information with us. We imagine that if any alum who
donates money to the university requested a copy of the
budget, he would get one. Why not give one to interested
students?

W&L tries to maintain a community of trust. Both the
Board and students are members of that community. Hiding
something as innocuous as a budget from students is
antithetical to that sense of trust.

Why all the secrecy?

So

I was not a good friend of yours, just a casual friend.
I didn’t share your intimate secrets, only those you cared to
make known in casual conversation. Sitting here late into
the night, thoughts of you come back, and I begin to realize
what we all have lost through a tragic accident. 7

I remember how I met you. When I returned to town
last September, the very same day the freshmen arrived, I ‘
checked in with Professor Marks to see about contacting
Jewish freshmen, He gave me some names and sent me to
you — you were the one freshman that had already sought
him out. You had volunteered to help contact other Jewish
freshmen in time for Rosh Hashanah ... and so had I.

I remember waking you up from a nap that afternoon. |
You were tired and grumpy, but immediately put on a smile
when you found out why I was there. :

I remember Homecoming Weekend. I’m not sure if I .
saw you ... but I know I met your father. He had traveled
over 3,000 miles to visit you and his alma mater. I only ‘
spoke to him for maybe five minutes. We literally bumped ,
into each other at the dorm room of the Hillel president.
We were both looking for him, and your dad mistook me *
for him. Once we settled who was who, we began chatting ,
... mostly about you. He was a very proud father.

I also remember four sabbath dinners, two outings to ’
teach the little kids at the Lexington Jewish Sunday School,
about a dozen Hillel meetings and, strangely enough, —
bumping into you even more often through mutual friends. *
You were just always there. But now you are not. :
And I remember last week. Just six days before you
died, we were sitting around a dinner table along with some +
‘ | other Jewish students planning Hillel’s calendar for next

year. Many of the ideas came from you. Ideas that are now
irrevocably written into the future of that organization, and »
through it, the history of this school. ;
The enormity of what I, your friends, Hillel and W&L
have lost has not yet set in. I’ve been too busy running °
around, working on this newspaper, writing papers and |
helping to plan your memorial service (the very least I can
do) to weigh the cosmic implications. There is so much <
more I can say in this column, but I won’t. Like your life,
it will remain unfinished ...

IFC tears into :
Tear Night

The Interfraternity Council significantly altered the

 

 

 

 

 

 

format of Tear Night this week. No longer, it seems, will
fraternities be able to put a wild, hedonistic cap of
camaraderie on the worst two weeks of a fraternity’s year.

Too bad. In many ways, we'll miss the old Tear Night.
It holds some of our fondest memories.

Fun aside, however, Tear Night was dangerous. Each
year, Tear Night sent many more students to Stonewall
Jackson Hospital than could possibly be healthy for W&L.

growing less fun. Everywhere you look, the problems of
our society are forcing individuals to sacrifice short-term
happiness for long-term well being.

In this age of increased responsibility — and, in all
honesty, liability — the tradition of Tear Night simply
costs too much in both human and economic terms.
Without gutting Tear Night, the IFC has produced a

plan that should eliminate injuries. We urge fraternities to
follow it.

Quotes of the Week

But they're so much happier half-nude and really drunk.

for the old, traditional Tear Night.

Let IT RIDE
By Chris Swann

I have a very strange job. I write
about eight hundred words and try to
make people laugh. Sounds like a great
occupation: work for about an hour,
then kick back with a Busch. Or, if I’m
feeling daring, a shot of Jack: Some-
times both. But, like most things, my
life is a little more complicated than
that. First, writing is like giving birth to
a very large child. And that child can
become nearly anything, from a Nobel
Prize physicist to a drive-thru operator
at McDonald’s. I look back on my
columns and sometimes feel like I fa-
thered a few odd and perhaps demented
offspring. At least they can’t grow up
and quit college on me, or wreck my
car.

And I do a little more than write

for a newspaper. Like, go to class,
contrary to my father’s beliefs. He’s
not a big advocate of Spring Term--
“You're taking one class and I’m pay-

erature (the new’ Tom Clancy, and

Stephen King novels, along with the
occasional Batman graphic novel), and
work in a distinguished restaurant (peel
cold, half-eaten lasagna off plates in
the Pit). I’m a busy guy.

Of course, graduation will change
all of this. I won’t be able to make fun

What does this resurgent tide of spiritualism mean

bound to traditional beliefs, he was capable of
doing anything. Man, not God, was considered to

impose limits upon themselves, for that is what
spirituality is about: imposing limits upon one’s
actions. Why do we willingly submit ourselves to
limits? It may in part be simple self-preservation.

As we face the rapid destruction of our earth,
spirituality provides an answer. If we view the
earth as superior to us, or as sacred, we are less
likely to pollute it. This simple belief, enshrined in
many religions, serves to preserve the earth for the
generations to come. We need to rediscover the
limits imposed on us by spirituality, for only then
can we save ourselves from destruction.

Reality has shown us man cannot do what-
ever he wants, for he will destroy himself. Man is
a social animal, he feels a need to belong to a
group, and in many cases it is this group that
provides the limits for his action.

Don't forget to watch your fly

Fly fishing requires a sportsman's full attention and complete concentration

 

By Joyce BAUTISTA
Phi Features Editor

The unusually wet spring has not kept some
avid fly-fishermen from pursuing the sport they
enjoy.

“The recent rains make the water muddy and the
fish don’t bite,” junior Holt Crews said.

The lures used in fly fishing are scentless, so the
fisherman depends on the “look” of the lure, he said.

“Besides that, the only adverse effect the rain
has is getting wet,” Crews said.

Junior Garrett Lischer calls Crews a “fanatic.”

While Crews would continue to fish, Lischer
said he would rather stay indoors when it rains and
gets cold.

: Philosophy Professor Charles Boggs finds the
recent wet weather a plus for fly-fishermen because
of the added nutrients the mud brings into the rivers
and streams.

“The fish are enjoying a bounty right now,”
Boggs said. “A wet spring is ideal for fishermen.”

- “It’sagreat escape,” Lischer said. “It helps you
forget about everything else.”

According to Lischer, he prefers to fly-fish in
the Shenandoah National Forest, which is about a
two-hour drive from Lexington. Though the rain-
bow and native brook trout are smaller, he said they
aye “wilder” and make for more challenging sport.

- “You can tell the difference between stocked
and wild fish by the amazing color of the smaller,
unstocked fish,” he said.

* The South River, which is near Lexington, is
stocked by local game officials, Lischer said.

“Stocked fish are more lethargic,” he said.

According to Crews, most rivers around the
Lexington area are stocked. Crews said in addition
to the Shenandoah National Forest, he likes to fish
the Jackson River for rainbow trout.

According to him, a great stretch of the Jackson
ig “catch-and-release,” where fish are put back after
being caught.

“This allows the fish to get bigger,” Crews said.

The Jackson is an experimental river, Crews
said. It was stocked heavily for a year in the hopes of
spurring natural reproduction.

Fly-fishermen can fish for trout during almost
every month of the year, Boggs said. He fishes the

gamut of locations, “from nameless mountain brooks
to the James River.”

Boggs said he fishes alone 99 percent of the
time.

“(Fly fishing] leads you to a deeper understand-
ing of aquatic eco-systems,” he said. “You have a
better understanding of the insect life of the stream
in relation to the other life in the river as well as the
cycle of the seasons.”

Anthropology Professor John McDaniel said
the number of fly-anglers is growing.

“Casting doesn’t take strength,” he said. “It
requires wonderful athletic ability, grace and coor-
dination.”

Fly fishing is one of the few sports where men

and women compete together, he said. McDaniel
has worked for Mel Krieger, who he calls “the most
prominent instructor in the world.”

“Many fly-fishermen are attracted to the aes-
thetic appeal of casting,” McDaniel said. “It’s a
beautiful art form.”

According to Lischer, unlike fishing with a
spinning reel, where one cast sends the weight into
the water, fly fishing requires casting the line back
and forth until enough line is out. The rods are also
lighter and longer than other fishing rods.

“It’s more fun to catch on a fly-rod,” Crews
said. “Lots of time is spent not using the reel at all.
Instead of rod and reel, it’s you fighting the fish.”

According to Boggs, in the last 10 years fly
fishing has become immensely popular.

Lischer agrees, adding that fly fishing has be-
come one of the “yuppie sports of choice” in the last
few years.

“Most of those people think you need a credit
check before buying anything,” he said.

According to Boggs, fly fishing equipment
needn’t be expensive.

“It’s a matter of understanding the animal and
its habitat,” Boggs said. “It’s a matter of knowing
how to take care of yourself. Experience has to be
earned and learned, not bought.”

Boggs, Crew and Lischer all agree that the most
important thing to do if one wants to learn how to fly-
fish is to be taught by a competent, experienced
fisherman.

According to McDaniel, important factors in
the future of fly fishing are environmental problems
such as acid rain and excessive timbering.

Regardless of the pressing problems of envi-
ronment, fly-fishermen still enjoy the time spent
outdoors.

"After I caught my first fish," Lischer said, "I
was hooked."

“Everytime I go out I learn more about nature,”
Boggs said. “After 30 years there are alot of legends,
rituals, stories and running jokes among friends.”

Coping with grief and death

Remembrance helps soothe the pain of loss

 

ASK Dr. WORTH
By Dr. James Worth

Given the tragedy that befell
our campus last Monday I am de-
parting from my usual “Ask Dr.
Worth” format to say some things
about shock and grief and death. |
do this with full awareness that noth-
ing I could write will in any way
soften the impact of this loss
nor shield us from the pain
of the mourning that needs
to be done.

Reactions to a sud-
denandunexpecteddeath \\\
are highly individual with
no two people responding in
exactly the same way. Still, there
is a general pattern into which many,
if not most people fall.

The usual first reaction is shock
and disbelief. This cannot be true; it
could not have happened. The de-
nial might be amomentary flicker of
doubt or a complete non-acceptance
that lasts for minutes or hours.

Following the first wave of
shock and disbelief can come a pe-
riod of uncertainty, confusion and
disorganization. Some will cry, oth-
ers will seek privacy and withdraw
into themselves.

Others still will seek shelter in
contact with someone they trust, such
as a close friend or relative.

There is a strong sense of want-
ing to do something but feeling that
there really is nothing anyone can
do.

ass
Ss
ce : i

‘

Out of this can emerge feelings
of helplessness and anger. The an-
ger often is diffused, directed at no

 
   

person in particular. But sometimes
a target is found.

A person might blame someone
else or they might even find a reason
to blame themselves and feel guilty.
In most cases, the anger is a product
of the helplessness and pain one feels
when through death one is separated
permanently from another. It can

also be outrage at the apparent
meaninglessness of the death.
For most people these
symptoms will pass into a
stage of resolution and true
acceptance,
Obviously the re-
lationship the individual has
had with the one who died
will determine to a great extent
how intense and how long the griev-
ing process will be.

I suspect for many of us here at
W&L the next few weeks are not
going to be easy.

We can help one another by
listening, by caring, by nurturing and
by accepting the grief we feel, col-
lectively and individually.

Many people are available to
listen. By all means, talk through
your feelings with someone else.

When someone I know dies, I
try to set aside some time for reflec-
tion. What was this person’s mes-
sage to me in the sense of what they
stood for and what kind of life they
lived? What did they teach me and
what in them will live on in me?

As we grieve Lisa Corwin's
death, let us also celebrate her life
and resolve to carry on the warmth,
compassion and joyfulness she
brought into our midst.

Crockett said Corwin’ was
friends with other German students.

‘‘The German students are a
tight-knit group who socialize out of
class,”’ he said. ‘‘Lisa was very much
a part of that group and very much a
part of German here.”’

Corwin played outfield for the
club softball team, where captain Jill
Jacques will remember her as a dedi-
cated player.

“‘She was one of the backbones
of the team, always there and always
enthusiastic,’’ Jacques said. ‘“*She was
very supportive whether she was
playing or not.”’

Junior Shannon Smith, one of
Corwin’s friends, said she was in-
volved with so many aspects of cam-
pus life that she is certain to be
missed.

Kozak said the state of the eco-

concentrate more on their futures.

‘*‘We’re seeing students who are
more focused on what they'll be
doing in four years,’’ she said.

Kenneth Ruscio, associate dean
of the Commerce School and former
associate dean of students for fresh-
men, believes W&L has been consis-
tently drawing a high caliber student
body and that the trend is more
steady than sharply upward.

“The academic quality of the
students has been uniformly high
since I’ve been here,’’ Ruscio said,
who became an assistant professor of
politics in 1987. ‘‘I’ve seen a high
level of work here, and that hasn’t:

From Staff Reports here. So I have to work for that.’’

All-in-all, Baker said it was a
successful year and she was happy
with everything.

“Tl played well, up to my
ability. I was happy with the year.”

This year will be a tough one
to top, but Baker says she’s not even
worried about that.

“I’m not even worried about
next season. I’m going to practice at
home during the summer and worry
about winning or losing. With tennis,
you have to go out and play your
game.”’

Baker also realizes she will

“‘On that particular day he was
just better than I was,’’ said Yates.

“At this level, it just depends
on how you’re playing on that day.”’

Yates, a transfer from the
United States Naval Academy, was a
three-time ODAC champion, one for
singles, two for doubles. His singles
title came this year as well as the
honor of ODAC Player of the Year.

 

Postseason honors have been
bestowed on eight Washington and
Lee athletes from three different
sports.

First off, the W&L women’s
lacrosse team placed three players
on the Brine/IWLCA South Region
All-America squad. Sophomore

 

Marilyn Baker has achieved
another milestone in the first year of
her Washington and Lee career.

Baker became the first Wash-
ington and Lee women’s tennis player
to win a match at the Division III
Individual Championships.

Senior Richard Yates ended an
excellent tennis career on Monday
after losing in the first round of the

 

midfielder Angie Carrington and
senior defender Whitney Hopkins
were both voted to the first team.

Ironically, Carrington was not
selected to the All-ODAC team
after ending the year with 19 goals
and 10 assists in just 11 games,

Hopkins helped anchor the
Generals defense, which allowed
just 81 goals in 15 games. She also
scored an important goal in the
overtime victory over Roanoke in
the ODAC finals.

Senior Kimberly Bishop was
an honorable mention selection at
the attack position. She ended her
career as W&L’s leading scorer
with 122 goals, 34 assists and 156
total points.

Senior Clay Thomas was the
only member of a solid W&L golf
team to make the NCAA Division
Ill golf championship at the
Wooster Country Club in Wooster,
Ohio. Play began Tuesday for the
ODAC Player of the Year, whose
stroke average this year is 77.7.

The Generals were not se-
lected to the team competition for
the first time since 1989. W&L
finished 7th at the distinguished
Gordin Collegiate Classic and was
the only team from that tournament
not to make the national competi-
tion. The Generals also disposed of
two other tournament teams during

just announced this week. The
Generals placed four players on the
squad. Senior Alan Herrick and
junior P.J. Waicus received first
team honors. Senior Will Davis
was a second team selection and
junior Chris Hagge was an honor-
able mention recipient.

The Generals finished their
season with a 15-10 record, their
fourth consecutive state champion-
ship and they placed seventh at the
Eastern Regionals.

The Washington and Lee
men’s and women’s track team fin-
ished up their seasons at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina Invita-
tional at Chapel Hill. Senior
Charles Edwards broke his own
school record in the 10,000-meter
race with a time of 31:59.6. The
new school-record time earned
Edwards a second-place finish. Bo
Hannah finished fourth in the
event. While senior tri-captain Jim
Henry earned sixth place in the
shot put.

In the women’s meet, fresh-
man Sarah Gilbert set her fourth
school record, this time in the
triple jump. Her leap covered 33’-4
1/4’’. Gilbert closed out her first
season with records in the triple
jump, the long jump, the 400 hur-
dles and the 400-meter relay.

“The win gives me a positive
look towards the future, as to what I
can accomplish here.’’ said Baker.

By receiving an invitation to
the Championships, Baker became
only the second W&L freshman
woman to make the tournament.

Baker drew Cathy Biros from
St. Thomas of Minnesota in the first
round. Baker took the match, 6-4, 6-
7(4-7), 6-1. She said she stumbled a
bit in the second before regaining her
form in the third.

“T was up 4-0 in the second
and I didn’t start playing bad. It’s just
the girl changed her game and got on
a role. In the third set I played like I
should have in the second.”’

In the second round, the round
of 16, the 17th-seeded Baker had the
unenviable task of trying to defeat
7th-seeded Katja Zarek from Kenyon.
On this day, it wasn’t meant to be.

Baker fell to Zarek in straight
sets, 6-3, 6-1, ending her stint at the
Championships. Baker said she was
beaten by a better player and feels
she learned from the defeat.

“I definitely learned some key
points in my game that I have to
work on,’” she said.

“TI need experience and a
powerful weapon. Tennis is a sport

face stern competition from her own
teammates next year.

“‘T know the number one spot
isn’t guaranteed. I have some tough
