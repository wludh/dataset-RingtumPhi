President Addresses Opening Assembly

Huntley Calls For New Trust

Washingten ant Lee began its
224th academic year last Wednes-
day with the official noon opening
convocation held in the New Dore-
mus gymnasium. President R. E. R.
Huntley, by tradition, delivered the
opening address, challenging W&L
to maintain its “community of trust
and simultaneously to pursue acade-
mic excellence” in the stead of ex-

tensive physical improvements on
the campus.
Huntley acknowledged the fact

that Washington and Lee begins the
year with a record enrollment of
approximately 1,700 students in the
School of Law and the undergradu-
ate schools. Among the “firsts” of
the year will be six women in the
law school—the first female students
ever admitted to pursue a W&L de-
gree.

Although actual coeducation is
still limited to the law school, one
Hampden-Sydney man and 21 wom-
en (predominantly from Hollins
College) will attend W&L this year
in the undergraduate schools as part
of the Eight-College transfer pro-
gram, either for the full year or for
one or two terms,

The record enroliment includes
393 freshmen, by far the largest ever
at W&L.

Huntley applauded the fact that
not only was the goal for alumni
funds exceeded last year, but the
goal for parental funds aws ex-
ceeded as well. He announced that
the preparation of the site for the
new law facility was already under
way; also, he said, the contract for
the new law building (made possible
by the $9-million gift by Frances
and Sydney Lewis of Richmond)
would be drawn up this winter.

On the financial front Huntley
pointed confidently to the fact that

Says Rush Chairman—

interest on student loans is diminish-
ing, allowing for the allocation of
more student aid in the future. The
project annual budget, he added, is
projected at $6,8-million.

“Planning on the undergraduate
library is well under way,” Huntley
said, and continued that housing for
married students and other addi-
tional undergraduate dormitories are
scheduled to see construction within
the next year or two.

Having established the financial
blessings which have been recently

bestowed on the university, Huntley
called on students and facully to
make a new commitment to acade-
mic progress at the university. He
recalled several past speeches of Dr.
James G. Leyburn, who, as a past
dean of the university, had helped
set the academic goals of Washing
ton and Lee for the “60's and 70's
Huntley said that the major aims

faculty and student body, a striving

A pplications Currently Bein g Accepted
For 2 Graduate Program Study Grants

Applications are currently being
accepted for two graduate study
opportunities, the Danforth Fellow-
ships and the Fulbright-Hays Pro-
gram for Study abroad.

The Danforth Fellowship program
was begun in 1952 by the Danforth
Foundation. The fellowships are
open to all qualified persons who are
planning to enter an accredited U.S.
graduate school in the fall of 1973.
The program is designed for stu-
dents planning careers in teaching
and/or administration at the college
level,

Applicants must also be under 30
years of age, and they must not yet
have undertaken any graduate or
professional study beyond the bac-
calaureate.

Grants under the Danforth pro-
gram are awarded for one year, and
are normally renewable until com-
pletion of the degree up to a maxi-
mum of four years. Fellowship sti-

Rush Proceeding

Even with an inundation of books,
homework, adjusting to college life,
and just “getting into the swing of
things,” 320 of the 393 members of
the class of 1976 are currently par-
ticipating in Rush activities.

In fact, freshmen are taking to
fraternities more this year than was
the case last fall, or at least that’s
what early trends seem to say.

“From all indications. it's going
extremely well this year.” states
Rush Chairman John Syvertsen.

UTLOOK and REVIEW

September 20, 1972

September Song

Like it or not, the month of September is back for a return
engagement. That great summer party is over, and a whole new
party (or whatever) is about to begin.

As President Huntley stressed in his opening address, we
embark on what is, at least in terms of pure growth, one of the
most exciting years in the university's history. The bulldozers
have already moved in to clear land for the new law. school
buildings. Upperclass dormitories and the new library are
passing from the drawing board stage. This year’s freshman
class is the largest ever, and significantly enough, was drawn
on a more selective basis than those of Johns Hopkins or Cor-
nell, among others,

Not to mention our sheer joy at welcoming the 20 some-odd
exchange coeds to the undergraduate schools and the six femin-
ine lawyers-to-be, who are new to the campus this year.

We trust this means growth for Washington and Lee, not
just in terms of physical expansion, but in educational quality
and achievement as well. The opportunities are there.

Whatever hapens during the course of the year, we at the
Ring-tum Phi will do our best to keep you abreast of events and,

For Tennis Freaks Only

Its a warm, sunny day during the first few weeks of school,
the work load isn’t too strenuous yet, so what do you do while
waiting for that inevitable mid-October crunch? Play tennis,
of course, So you grab a partner and bop on down to the tennis

six other people waiting on the benches to play.

with an untouched sandwich and an
unwanted orange, I walk over to his

He looks up at me with eyes as blue

Upon the railing that lines the

old men of Lexington, weary sold-

glacier, leaving furrous and scars of
events. They look like the backwash
of any city, any size: the
deadman’s clothes, the same broken
posture, the same hollow eyes. Rest-
ing hands like hunks of rotting
stumps on the mental railing, they
reminisce the days away. Main
Street bustles by, but that railing is
a time machine, a tube into the past,

‘Modern’ Boulez Revives Past !

With this column we inaugurate
a new series of reviews and articles
on music—all kinds of music, in
fact, including classical, rock, jazz,
and blues, Highlighted will be criti-
ques from Pat Hinely and Richard
Johnson, though anyone interested
in writing for this series is invited to
submit an sample column to us in
the Ring-tum Phi office. Most of the
records reviewed will be obtained
in the Co-op’s record store. This
week Johnson provides some
thoughts on New York Philharmonic
director Pierre Boulez and the emer-
gence of contemporary music,

—Ed,
By RICH JOHNSON
The music of the first two de-
cades of our century, now more

than years old, made a break with
its antecedents unprecedented in
previous musical revolutions from
Philippe de Vitry to Monteverdi to
Chopin, Liszt, and Wagner. For the
first time melody, rhythm, and har-
mony were simultaneously rethought
and recreated by the imagination of
a few men.

Debussy and Scriabin, who failed
to survive those two decades, initiat-
ed a harmonic revolution whose
consequences are to be heard in al-
most any popular song today. Un-
resolved dissonances gave harmony,
that uniquely western musical idea,
an eastern freedom from sequential-
ity.
Stravinsky wrought the change in
rhythm all by himself in three great
ballets: The Firebird, Petrushka, and
The Rite of Spring. He was followed
by Bartok in The Miraculous Man-

Summer of ’72:
Did Lexington
Change At All?

By BRYAN HATCHETT

lt may be a source of personal
security for some of us, to know
that upon returning to Lexington in
the fall, we will find it nearly indis-
tinguishable from the Lexington he
left in the spring.

But even in this haven for the
Daughters of the Confederacy time-
pinning for the ante-bellum
past, we have noted the following
modifications.

Was it only last spring when we
learned that 10 million tax exempt
dollars, donated by Sidney Lewis,
would be building a new law school.
Already part of the rewards of his
highly successful catalogue sales
firm is paying for those yellow cater-
pillars and dump trucks churning
up dust near the football field.

And inside the present law build-
ing, there is an innovation that our
future barristers seem to be taking
in stride, Girls, real live, honest to

darin and by his later American self
and most other Americans from the
forties on.

Under the scrutiny of Schoen
berg, melody, which in the guise of
theme had been a means of unify-
ing large musical statements, broke
down into sequences of intervals not
necessarily linked with particular
rhythmic expressions and emphases.
The tone row became a new basis
for musical construction, both melo-
dic and harmonic, and even today
opinion is divided: what has been
for some composers and listeners a
liberation from the rhetoric of past
musical forms seems for others only
a straitjacketing of personal expres-
sion,

The fate of Schoenberg's revolu-
tion is thus yet undecided, though we

have the subsequent developments
of Berg, Webern, Boulez, Nono,

and Stravinsky as evidence of its fer-
tility. But the revolutions in har-
mony and rhythm, though partially
recanted by their creators and used

as spice in generally more conserva-
tive frameworks (Stravinskyan and
French neo-classicism, or the neo-
romantic later works of Prokofiev
and Bartok), have undoubtedly suc-
ceeded, not only in composed music
since World War Two, which gen-
erally lies somewhere between We-
bern and Stravinsky, but in the most
innovative rock and jazz. Herbie
Hancock and Frank Zappa listen to
Stravinsky. Paradoxically, only the
most unstructured jazz sounds any-
thing like Schoenberg or Webern or

the even more highly structured
postwar serialism.
Now that Debussy’s harmonies

and Stravinsky’s rhythms surround
us from movie scores to Muzak, a
trip back to the roots is refreshing.
Pierre Boulez, in an excellently en-
gineered series of Columbia record-
ings. proves that the revolution in
music of half a century ago was
sensual as much as_ intellectual,
pleasure for the ear as well as the
mind,

University Center Plans
Open House Festivities

An activities fair, a coed party in
the Cockpit, Sunday films, a faculty-
student discussion series, and im-
proved service in the Cockpit.

These were some of the items of
business at the University Center
Committee’s first meeting of the
year last Monday.

An activities fair, complete with
combo party and a number of tour-
naments, is planned for this Satur-
day night in the University Center.
The combo “Voyce” will play in the
Cockpit beginning at 8:30 p.m. Ad-
mission is free. The film, The Bed-
ford Incident, originally scheduled
for Saturday night as part of the
activities fair, has been moved to
Sunday night in the Cockpit. The
tournaments include events in chess,
bridge, pinball and pool, with cash
prizes in each event. They will be-
gin at & p.m. Sign-up sheets are
available at the Bookstore and Uni-
veristy Center, with the entry dead-
line Thursday at 5 p.m.

The Committee is also planning a
coed party a week from Saturday,
on September 30, with Sweet Briat
College. With Sweet Briar girls as
special guests, the party will take
place in the Cockpit, with a live
combo. Bob Bruyere, co-chairman
of the committee, stated that “Sweet
Briar estimates that over 100 girls
will attend the event, and several
busses have been reserved to bring
them to the campus that night.”

Beginning tonight, at 8 p.m., a
weekly faculty-student discussion
series begins in the University Cen-
ter Library, according to Ken Lane,
the University Center Committee's
advisor. Tonight's guest is Professor
Harry Pemberton, chairman of the
Philosophy Department. The topic
is “The Achievement of the Living
and the Dead.” The program is open

WGL Intramurals:

What's Their Purpose?

By PALMER TRICE

What is the purpose of the In
ramural program? Is it a competi

m between houses to which
has the superior group of athletes,
or is it a program designed so that
even the most frustrated athletes
can participate and have fun? It is

very easy to say that should be

both—that the two goals can be
harmonized, But that is not to say
what it is now. In most houses, es

pecially the more athletic ones, the
competition is stiff, and the desire to
win is not just the primary goal, but
the only goal, Is this right? If it
isn’t, can we do something about it?
Should this be a matter of Univer-
sity policy, or is it something that
each house must determine on its
own?

Whatever the case
the football Generals open the 1972
season, hundreds of Wash
ington and Lee athletes will take
to the gridiron, as the 1972-73 In-
tramural season opens. Monday will
also see the commencement of com
petition in tennis and golf. Intra
mural manager John Runge says
that the I-M set-up will basically be

two days after

olnel

Navy vs

the same as last year's, with special
emphasis being put on development
of programs already begun.

Dut to a shortened rush, there
will be no programs set up specifi-
cally for freshmen. Rush ends two
weeks after the I-M season begins.

Tennis has been changed a bit
since last year. Matches will con-
sist of two singles contests and one
doubles, this being a cutback of two
singles contests from last year. This
was necessitated by the loss of the
hard courts, which were obliterated
in the early construction phases of
the law school, Construction has also
forced all football agmes to be play-
ed on the middle field,

Eligibility regulations have chang-
ed slightly. The Intramural Man-
ager has determined that inactive
members of a fraternity may not
participate in behalf of that frater-
nity. They can play only for the In-
dependent Union. Eating and/or
Social members of a house may
play for that house, if they are pay-
ng dues of at least $10.00 a month.

Aside from the forementioned
modification, John Runge says steps

Good Season Predicted

For Cross-Country, Soccer ©

By PAUL CAVALIERE, JR.
and TOM ANGELLO

“This could ‘be the best soccer
team in the school’s history, even
better than the team that went to
the Eastern Regionals four years
ago,” said head soccer coach Joe
Lyles. This team is loaded with ex-
perience, led by tri-captains Meade
Kempfmueller, Brandon Herbert,
and John Buckley, all seniors, The
team also has an excellent group of
sophomores, and a fine group of
freshmen, headed up by Bob Sillers,
Billy Cogar, and a very impressive
goalie in Jeff Baum. In total, there
are about fifty candidates out for
soccer,

Coach Lyles has stated that he
would go basically with the same
players as last year, since the team
lost no one to graduation. The
coach did say that he would add
many new formations and substitute
quite frequently.

Practices are running quite smooth-
ly. They consist of a lot of running
and scrimmages. During these scrim-
mages, players are urged to change
positions to get accustomed to play-
ing several positions,

The 1972 schedule will be a tough
one. With six games on the road,
the team must be mentally prepared
for all of its games. None of the
teams on the schedule are push-
overs, This rough away schedule is
headed up by the U.S. Naval Aca-
demy. The team does have four
home games, which should prove to
be thrillers,

Last Friday afternoon W&L
scrimmaged VMI and beat the
Cadets 7-2. Washington and Lee
was very aggressive. They had some
excellent line play, headed up by
Jimmy Fox and Billy Spofford, and
a fairly strong edfense anchored by

Rolf Piranian. The scrimmage show-
ed that we need to work a lot more
on our defense and on team passing.
The squad is looking forward to a
scrimmage this Sunday against the
University of Virginia at Charlottes-
ville. Game time is 2:00 p.m.

All in all, the Washington and
Lee University soccer team is very
enthusiastic, and they realize that
they have a combination that can
take them all the way to the Eas-
tern Regionals again, This team has
a vast amount of experience and
plenty of depth to carry it through
its tough schedule. Coach Lyles
couldn't have said it better, “This
could be the best soccer team in the
school’s history.”

Coach Dick Miller’s harriers open
the cross country season at Centre
College on September 30. This sea-
son promises to be an exciting one
with marked improvement over last
year’s 3-7 record, Despite the loss of
standout Carter Glass, co-captains
Bill Kalal and Bob Sherwood return
to lead the Generals.

Much of the favor over the new
year is over sophomore Stu Nibley,
who has taken over the No. 1 spot.
Although pre-season workouts have
just begun, it is evident that Nibley
will be the premier runner. Coach
Miller anticipates that he will be
one of the best runners in Washing-
ton and Lee history.

For 1972-73 the Generals will
field a great deal more depth than
last year, The ranks are beefed up
by twelve promising freshmen. Dur-
ing time trials this past Saturday,
Tem Washington, Doug McNeel,
Mike Burns, and Bill Garrison all
ran with varsity potential.

The toughest dual meet of the
year is expected to come from

Football Season
Blue Takes On Titans,

pens:

Winners of Last 22

By LEWIS HIXSON

The 1972 season looks a great
leal more promising than it did a
year ago at this time. Last year
coach Buck Leslie started the sea-
ion with a relatively young and in-
‘xperienced team and it showed as
hey dropped their first four games
while averaging only 4 points per
zontest. However, those four games
were very valuable in terms of ex-
perience and the team came back to
lake 4 of 5. It was a complete re-
versal as the Generals averaged 25
points while holding their opponents
0 12 points per game ,during the
ast half of the season.

This year Coach Leslie has 31
‘eturning lettermen from that squad
hat finished so well last year, Strong
points remain at almost all positions
on offense while some patchwork
will be needed on defense, The back-
lield should be a good one as it in-
cludes Steve Fluharty at the helm
giving out instructions to Tom Van
Amburgh and Jim Farrar at Tail-
back and Fullback respectively. Van
Amburgh came on strong at the
tnd of last season and from all in-
ications, he should be ready to
pick up where he left off. Jim Far-
rar is the man who likes to run into
and over people and seems to ad-
here to the theory that the shortest
distance to the goal line is a straight
line.

Steve Fluharty is back for his sen-
ior year and seems ready to make it
his best one, although that may be
hard to do. He was ranked 7th in
the country his sophomore year and
last year was first team All-State and
All-Conference. He'll be throwing
lo the same receivers as he did last
year and that can’t hurt. Chappy
Conrad, who shared All-State and
All-Conference honors with Flu-
harty, should be on the receiving
end of many passes and although
he’s recovering from a bruised knee,
he is slated to be starting on Sat-
urday. Conrad also punted for a
40.6 yard average, which placed him
13th in the nation in that specialty.
Besides Conrad, Bill Baldwin and
Mark Lane will be returning to their
old positions at end and flanker re-

spectively. Lewis Powell is the best
back-up quarterback around, Coach
Leslie has complete confidence in
his ability to move the team,

Although this looks very promis-
ing, the strongest point on offense
this year could well be the line. The
entire offensive line that worked so
well together by the end of last sea-
son returns, Bob Brand and Buz
Walters will be at the tackles, while
Archer Frierson, Don Eavenson, and
Lanny Rainey are well experienced
at the guard position and Ed Ko-
wal is back at center.

Coach Leslie is hoping that this
group will hold up well during the
first part of the season, allowing
some other players to get some gra-
dual and unhurried experience, Over-
all, the chances look very good that
the offense can pick up where it left
off last year.

If problems are going to occur at
the start of the season, it is likely
that they will be found on defense.
Despite the loss to graduation, there
is still good leadership in the de-
fensive areas of the line, linebackers,
and secondary, Tim Haley is tough
as linebacker and was one of the
team leaders in tackles last season.

Marshall Washburn should add
the leadership needed to the second-
ary, and he'll be calling the signals

for the pass defense. John Mark
ley and Ed McLaughlin are expect
ed to hold down their positions in
the line very solidly and should get
yme help from Bucky Leslie and
Johnny Sorrels. Linebackers Jim
Nolan, Jay Fulcher, and David
Turk, and Backs Mark  Diverio,
Jack Davidson and Bill Wallace
will make up the rest of the de-
fense,

The first game of the season
should test the defense quickly
enough, Westminister is a tough
opener for the Generals as they'll
try to make it 23 straight on Satur-
day. That's right, they’ve won 22 in
a row, after taking their opener last
week against Lockhaven by a 28-6
score. Coach Leslie says that,
“They're not unbeatable,” but
“they'll outweigh us and throw quite
a bit.” It should be a hard fought
game and the beginning of a sched-
ule that will be every bit as diffi-
cult as last year. Although we don’t
play Bucknell or the Coast Guard
this year, the Blue will face Deni-
son along with Westminister, and
Leslie feels that it may not be a
change for the better. Without a
doubt, there will be a wide open
game at Wilson Field this Saturday

as the Generals open a new season.

Summer of ’72
In Lexington

(Continued from page 3)
God, “nothin’ like a dame,” girls
are enrolled at Washington and Lee
for the first time.

Recent exchange programs have
briefly brought to our classrooms
that combination of lace, ruffles, and
denim which is the modern col-
lege girl, but these are the first fe-
males in line to receive a W&L de-
gree.

Conspicious by their absence this
semester will be Henry Sloss and
Dr. James Leyburn (though the lat-
ter showed up for a nostalgic even-
ing last week). In no way related
to the loss of either of these gentle-
men, but for what it’s worth, Bob
Keefe is donning the academic garb
again this year. The Director of the
University’s Office of Public In-
formation will teach an introductory
course to journalism,

Enough for the additions and
losses on campus. Downtown, the
free enterprise system suffered a
notable setback with the demise of
the Band Box Record Store. ....
It is rumored that a neighboring
greasy spoon will turn off the grill
for the last time within the near
ae and Ma Bell is ex-
panding her Lexington facilities, no
doubt in part, because of her ill
gotten dimes, lost by freshman, fail-
ing to read the directions on the
local pay phones,

Politically, Lexington has been
relocated into the Sixth Congres-
sional District of Virginia. In previ-
ous elections, Rockbridge County
has been included in the Seventh
District now represented by Con-
gressman Kenneth Robinson.

Students registered to vote in
Lexington as well as the good bur-
ghers themselves will choose among
three candidates for the House of
Representatives. The  incumbant
sixth district representative, Richard
Poff, will not seek re-election, choos-
ing to end his long career in Wash-
ington so he might serve as a justice
on the bench of the State Supreme
Court of Appeals.

And finally in this time of truth
in advertising. informed sources tell
us that WREL, the local radio sta-
tion, has spent a bundle on “jingles”
that will musically tell its listeners
that "WREL is Love.”.....

a 14-2 record, including victories

over major powers Army, Navy,

and Cornell, and advanced to the

semi-finals of the NCAA. national

championship tournament.

Besides his lacrosse duties, Em-
mer will assist W&L head football
coach Graham (Buck) Leslie and
serve as an instructor in physical
education. His primary responsibil-
ity in football will be the Generals’
defensive unit.

Emmer was an outstanding col-
lege athlete at Rutgers, where he
captained both the 1966 football
team and the 1967 lacrosse squad,
and was named Most Valuable
Player of both. He holds the all-
time Rutgers records for  pass-re-
ceiving in a game, season and ca-
reer. He was an all-East and hon-
orable mention All-American selec-
tion and was a 13th round draft
choice of the New York Jets,

In lacrosse, Emmer was voted
Rutgers’ most valuable player and
was a second team All-American
selection. He played in the 1967
North-South All-Star Game. After
graduation from college, he played
two years of professional football
with the Westchester Bulls of the
Atlantic Coast League and several
years of club lacrosse wtih the na-
tional champion Long Island Ath-
letic Club,

A native of Mineola, N.Y., Em-
mer coached for two years in New
York high schools before moving to
Cortland in 1969, He holds a B.S.
degree in physical education from
Rutgers and his master’s from Cort-
land,

“We are very pleased to have
someone of Jack Emmer’s ability at
Washington and Lee.” said Me-
Henry. “I'm confident he will carry
on the high level of lacrosse W&L
has enjoyed the past several years
under Coach Szlasa.”

In the past three years, W&L
teams have posted an overall mark
of 31-8. won or shared two division
championships and advanced to the
quarterfinals of the NCAA cham-
pionship tourney, Szlasa was named
1971 national “Coach-of-the-Year.”

“We are of course sorry to lose an
excellent coach such as Szlasa,” Me-
Henry said. “We wish him well in
his new poistion at Navy.”

‘Who’s Who’ Nominations Are Being Accepted

EC Discusses Financing Of Publications

By JOHN F. ZINK

Ihe Executive Committee, meet-
ing in a marathon session Monday
night, tackled the problem of allo-
cating the student tax among the
various publications; the committee
also heard from the various standing
committees and discussed the proce-
dure for nominating students to the
“Who's Who.”

Jim Beaty, chairman of Contact,
presented the financial status of his
committee by reporting that about
$3,700 was collected during registra-
tion. Bill Merrill, EC vice-president,
pointed out that this money must
be used to pay off last year’s Con-
tact debt. Beaty explained the need
for funds from the EC saying, “We
have planned our budget by assum-
ing that we would get money from
you.” He predicted a possible ex-

penditure of between $8,000 to
$9,000 this year.

The Calyx editor Pat Hinely, es-
timated this year’s budget at about
$14,660; he stated that the Calyx
would make about $5,000 and re-
quested $8,856 from the student tax.
Drew Staniar, Calyx business edi-
tor, promised a return to the style
of yearbook that will tell the story
of the school year. Bob Wilson,
Ariel editor, requested a budget of
about $3,600. Wilson explained the
additional $2,000 was needed for
the expanded efforts in the areas of
music, black culture, art, and the
theatre. Skip Paukert, editor-in-
chief of the Ring-tum Phi, predicted
a good year for the paper with an
upswing in advertising.

Bob Brennan, EC President, an-
nounced that the EC was accept-

Giammitorio says that the local
registrar has been somewhat hostile
to college students wishing to regi-
But, he added, students who
really want to register for the up-
coming election should not be “in-
timidated” by the local registration
procedure and should make a con-
crete effort to register.

Married students of W&L have
perhaps the best chance to register
locally, according to Giammitorio.
Those married men who are financi-
ally independent and who are from
within the state are more likely to
fall within the boundaries of the
elastic Virginia law to be able to
register,

The schedule for registration in
the Lexington and Rockbridge
County area is as follows:

Lexington: Sept. 28 and Oct. 7.

Rockbridge County: Sept. 28-29,

ed that the names of seniors must

day, Oct, 2nd; students and faculty
members may submit the names for
nomination,

The EC also heard from its stand-
ing committees, Larry Evans, Re-
cruiting Committee Chairman, an-
nounced plans to recruit Virginia
area high school students in the
next few weeks. Bob Bruyere of the
University Center Committee said

“We are trying to coordinate student
activities around the University

The entire marathon EC meeting
lasted approximately three hours.
The Calyx, the Ariel, and the Ring-
tum Phi are all part of the Wash-
ington and Lee University Publica-
tions Board, which is allocated

the omens of the public’s entrails
with fear, the quixotic crusader,
with followers in dusty jeans and

The real sadness of the campaign

Editor Of ‘Calyx’ Explains Fee

To the Student Body
As you may already know,
today was the first day to have
your portrait shot for the 1973
Calyx. The posters around cam-
pus contain full information as
to time and place. On the bot-
tom of the posters you will no-
tice that there is a $3.50 charge
In the past, this matter has
always been left to solve itself,
and until year, always did
Last year, though, someone no-
ticed the discrepancy between the

My main worry is that many
of you will pre-judge the 1973
book on the basis of what the
1972 book was like. Don't do
that, It's a mistake, Last year's
Calyx was a work of art; that
cannot and should not be denied.
However, that book didn't really
have enough bearing on WAL,
the subject matter wandered too
widely

My goal is to create the 1973
Calyx with as much pure visual
uppeal, if not more, than the
1972 book, but also to bring the
subject matter much closer to
the school. YOU are the subjects

If you don't have your por

Perry Mason Bites The Dust

W hile io ol the

l'reshman Cam

sessions at this year’s Natural Bridge
ere pretty familiar to those who had gone

throug! il

before, one element was decidedly different. The

purpose, essentially, of returning to the off-campus orientation

was to render our peculiar honor system comprehensible to

who had

tudents never had experience with it before.

The Executive Committee took charge of this effort, and,
by all accounts, performed it well, If they can be criticized at
all, it would be for approaching overkill with their message.
the fre

sut limen themselves made the task all the easier by

being unusually attentive throughout the numerous and some-

times boring sessions.

Phe question is: Do upperclassmen really understand their
honor system?
Several revisions resulted from last year’s troubles with

the honot tem, the first being the return of the “lying,
phrase to the White Book, a second

Public

cheating, and stealing”
being the right of Freshmen to serve as jurors in a

hearing

The major change, however, occurred in the procedure ol
the Public Honor hearing. With the increased number of
these hearings during the last two years, it became clear that

what had dev loped Was an advet sary, courtroom-type proce

dure, inimical to the purposes of the honor system itself.
To quote from the EC directly: “Essentially the procedure
been changed from that of an adversary system to one in
vhich a body similar to the EC is selected at random from the
tudent body a list of fifteen students (as compared to the

previous list of fifty) obtained from the registrar. At the public

hearng this group of twelve is presented with the same set of

acts as was the EC at the initial hearing. From that point on
the ‘new EC’ investigates the case in any way they deem

ppropriate, e.g., calling any witnesses they choose, question

ing the accused, and reviewing any of the evidence gathered at
the first hearing, When this group has completed its investiga
tion, they adjourn to deliberate and reach a verdict, As in the

| Public

t, the decision of the Hearing is final,”

o Perry Mason bites the dust, and a new emphasis on
retting at the facts of a case has been established. In addition
he me cedure goes a long way toward bringing the ac
cused directly to his peers; though he may retain an advisor

vho can help him present his case in the best possible manner,

| \ ‘ Hay n lress the ILC, or surrogate 1n( . directly

Co lering the increased incidence of the public trial at
W&l and with increased emphasis on the judgment of “the
tudes eneration involved,” we call on all students to make
ure they are clear as can be on these important changes

An Opposing Viewpoint

The ‘Pathetic’

Skip Paukert’s editorial in last
week’s paper, “For Tennis Freaks
Only,” came as a bit of a surprise
to me, at least in one respect. For
someone who has spent a consider-
able amount of time working in the
theatre especially in student
productions, | was surprised that
he could, in his initial editorial, be-
moan the lack of tennis facilities.
However, this article is not intend
ed as a poison-pen missive against

here,

Skip.

It is, rather, intended as a rebut-
tal of sorts to an editorial which
somehow, without even intending

to do so (L hope), expressed almost
perfectly a very depressing attitude
which seems to pervade this cam-
pus, or at least certain parts of it:
the almost total relegation of the
fine arts to a secondary status, with
little or no immediate value in a
student’s education, let alone as a
career possibility.

This attitude takes on a startling
physical form for anyone who has
taken a course in the arts. Over-
crowded art studios and slide view-
ing rooms, inadequate listening fac-
ilities and almost non-existent drama
rehearsal space,

No one can deny that tennis
courts are also needed, as are, I
suppose, new practice fields. But it
seems to me that in a_ university
those needs granted first priority
should be curricular needs. It has

become obvious to me that this uni-
versity’s administration has a very
different opinion of its priorities, al
least in the area of fine arts.

Plea For Studio S pace

Last winter, | had the privilege
of engaging in a series of rather long
conversations with a high admini-
stration official, concerning the acqui-
sition of a garage on Main Street
for studio theatre. The
theatre had been trying to acquire
this garage for at least three years
with either negative responses or
no response at all from the admini-
strauion.

This official began by confessing
that chances were again rather bleak
for acquiring the garage, which
prompted me to ask why, being the
inquisitive sort. Was it a matter of
money? No, he assured me that
money wasn't the problem, which
was nice to hear, since the rent was
only $260 per month. Well then,
what was the reason?

It turned out that this
didn’t to get tied
long-term lease as space could, mind
you, could become available within
the lease period, in which case the
university would be saddled with a
worthless building. Fine reasoning,
except that the lease requested by
for a mere three
years, which didn't seem very long-
term to me as one-third of it would
be up by this June. Especially con-
the dislocation which
come about when the various
annexes are torn down to make way
for the library, I didn't then
and still don't see were additional
space will become available for the

The Primary Needs

SPaece

asked him an easier question, the
one asked at the beginning of this
essay

State of W&L Arts

 

Students enrolled in one of W&L’s studio art courses are forced to work in crowded conditions with little el-
bow room,

What, | asked, did he see as the

primary needs of this university,
curricular or non-curricular needs?
Curricular, definitely — curricular.

And are there enough facilities now
for curricular P.E, needs? Yes, he
thought that there were.

Then just how in_ perdition
covld this University defend
spending over a half-million dol-
lars for athletic facilities un-
needed by the curriculum in a
department which doesn’t even
eff'r a major and yet turn
around and refuse to spend
$209 per month for desperately
needed facilities in a depart-
ment which is struggling to offer
a half-way decent major?

Well, did I ever stop to think of
the number of people the P.E. de-

partment serves? Yes, | had, also
taking into account the fact that
P.E. is required. And had he, or

anyone for that matter, stopped to
think of just how many people the
fine arts could serve if they were
given half a chance? The argument
was lost upon him . . . | doubt that
it even had occurred to anyone else.

Howling In The Wind

At any rate, the garage is now
the Country Store and I realize now
hat all my seemingly solid argu
ments were to no avail. Citing large
enrollment increases in the arts

(check it out sometime), proposing
that lack of studio and rehearsal
space was analagous to studying

science without lab space (think
about it), everything | could think
of seemed to land on deaf ears,

This became all the more obvious
when the ten-year plan was announc-
ed without a single mention of the
arts, The relegation seems complete.

| realize, of course, that all this
is merely howling into the wind as
it would take something in the area
of an act of God to change the
ten-year plan. And it is howling
which | don’t have to be doing, as
| wouldn't be around to reap any of
the benefits were it successful.

It just seems to me that this uni-
versity, through its adherance to a
frame of mind which refuses to ad-
mit the arts into their rightful place
in a liberal arts education is not only
depriving many of its most talented
students of the chance to develop
fully their talents, but it is, in the
longer run, making a mockery of its
pledge to provide the best education
possible for all its students.

Need For Student Action

I realize tiat this university has
probably never even dreamed of de-
veloping a regional center for the
arts, (such as it plans to do with the
law school) even though the faculty
is capable of such an undertaking
But the least it can do is put the
fine arts on a level comparable to
the other departments and stop
treating them as an extra-curricular
area (there are careers in the arts).

It was once said, by a student
during the more radical 60's, that
substantive change would only come

Continuing through Sept

about when students stopped relying
on the arbitrary good will of the ad-
ministration. I'm beginning to think
that this student was correct, The
arts are in rather pathetic shape
around here and I suppose that one
of two things will happen. Either
the talented students and faculty in
the arts will leave for greener pas-
tures, thus eliminating any chance
for development in the arts. Or else
these people will get off their asses
and start letting their will be known.

It will be up to the students, as
there are no alumni in the arts, I
just hope that the depressing attitude

which pervades the administration
isn't pervasive among the student

body.

Sabbath Showdown.

By BILL CHRIST

Baltimore’s Memoiral Stadium
encloses its rough-as-a-cat’s-tongue
turf like a lower jaw of rotten
teeth, thick-tartared, grey, and ugly.
It is the worst of fields, but it is the
best, for it is truly a ground of
battle. Primitive, elemental forces

meet here. man-thunder on the ter-
rain as jagged as a lightning bolt
and adamantine-hard, riddled with

malicious stones, packed with ankle-
popping potholes,

football should be
played, not upon some patchwork
of miniature golf course greens,
pool table slick, where at halftime,
heavy-thighed hillbilly women do
their porcine prancing, their leg
lifiing like so many mutts at a fire
hydrant, where football players spin
and click like billiard balls, and do
not bleed,

This is where

This cave of carnivores, of foot-
ball at its rawest, could be the only
setting for last Sunday's old time
cockfight, the Baltimore Colts
against the New York Jets, old men-
tor against new master, Johnny Uni-
tas and Joe Namath laying it all on
the line. | could not ride with that
Mongolian tube to the stadium, My
howling heart and | were stifled in
the Student Center TV room by the
jejunery of the Jurgensenless Red-
skins and their bureaucratic fol-
lowers,

Finally, the
ed the ¢

Red-tapeskins Kilmer-
ardinals into sleep and sub-
mission, and someone passed the
buck among those wild Washington
fans, who were frightened and fled.
Washington and Lee's star defensive
back, Jack Davidson, intercepted
the television set, changed its chan-
nel, and brought real football to the
sereen,

I missed the first half of the game,
but within it, the neon-eyed Namath
bullwhipped the Colts with three
linging touchdown passes in the
time of a 42nd St. wink (1 min., 29

negating a marathon kick-off
return for a touchdown by Don Me-

Cauley, and lifting the Jets to a 27
to 20 lead.
Ihe second half was a womb

teeming with legends, procreation of

space, the third quarter's

silence was broken only by

greal

passers.

the buzzing of importunate, gnat-
like receiver Eddie Bell, who bit the
soft, exposed flesh of Baltimore’s
zone defense for sore gains, and by
a short field goal by the Jet's Bobby
Howfield, But the frantic fourth!

John Unitas, Slavic mountebank,
wilded all his tools of dark craft with
grey-haired cunning, casting the
gristle-grinding spell of running
backs Don Nottingham and Tom
Matte upon the Jets, forcing them
back as if from fire to their own
end zone, to acquiescence, and a
Colt touchdown, Baltimore now
trailed by only three points, and the
stadium seemed to quiver with ex-
pectation, But the swarthy, slump-
ing Namath, unkind iconoclast, shat-
tered the shining workings of his
boyhood idol with instantaneous re-
prisal, a pass that landed soft as a
dream into the mythic stone fingers
of end Rich Caster, who carried it,
the Colt’s night mare, for a 79 yard
touchdown,

Baltimoer trailed by 10 points,
but cool John, ice-wizard with crab-
bed walk and atavistic high-topped
shoes, mixing images of run, sym-
bols of pass like an opium poet, de-
vised an epic drive to a rebuttal
touchdown. Once again the Colts
pull up close enough to peek over
the edge of the Jet's lead, The score
stands at 37 to 34, and those good,
hard Ballimoreans in the stands
chant the litany of comeback.

Oleaginous Joe slinks on the field
with the offensive platoon, huddles
his men in deep planning, lines up
at scrimmage and signals the snap
of the ball. Then, as peremptory as
a call girl, speeds defeat Baltimore-
way with that cable-strong arm, a
pass incredibly once more into the
uncertain hands of Rich Caster,
who outlegged Rex Kern, the pray-
ing cornerback for the touchdown
and deathblow. Colt players and
fans were aghast with the sudden-
ness of loss.

After the game, both men met on
the field for the rump-patting ritual
of football affection. Joe Namath
completed 15 of 28 passes for 497
yards, six touchdowns, and victory.
John Unitas completed 26 of 45 at-
tempts for two touchdowns and de-
feat, But the teams, and those grand
gunslingers, will meet again.

Gasca, Santana-Miles Combo
Produce New Jazz Albums

By W. PAT HINELY
FOR THOSE WHO CHANT
Luis Gasca Blue Thumb BTS 37
CARLOS SANTANA AND

BUDDY MILES! LIVE!
Columbia KC-31308
Here are two new facets of the San
Francisco Chicano musician's fam-
ily. Luis Gasea is the man who
comes out most ahead from these al-
bums. For Those Who Chant was
recorded in two days in a studio, and
the Santana-Miles album was all
taped in the course of one afternoon.
So here is something new from
these folks: jazz. The musicians on
both albums are an amalgamation
from several groups around the Bay
area, and the new combinations
prove they're still improving and
expanding their styles.

A trumpeting duel between Gasca
and Miles Davis would end in a
standoff, Carlos Santana proves be-
yond doubt, with help from Neal
Schon, that pure acid rock didn’t die
with Hendrix. The Gasca album pro-
bably won't make it big in anything
but jazz, if there. It’s not rockish
enough for the average Santana lis-
tener, but probably too rickish for
the average jazz litsener, This is a
shame, because the album is a fu-
sion of two heretofore unfused types
of music, One can only hope it will
be recognized as the landmark it is.

The Santana-Miles album, on the
other hand, can’t lose, With Buddy's
soul and Carlos’ licks, there's some
thing here for everyone, Side 2,

 

“Free From Funkafide Filth,” with
Lyrics by Leon Thomas, is the best
full-side cut to come along since the
Dead's “Dark Star.”

Though Buddy Mile’s style actu-
ally hinders the rest of the percus-
sion more than helping it,
Escovedo and his timbales salvage
the overall sound of the band quite
effectively. If you listen hard, you
can forget the steady thump-thump-
thump behind some of the best live
music ever recorded. The main
drawback of the album is excessive
audience noise, but in a volcanic
crater, | guess it’s unavoidable,

Tune out the screams of the
crowd and Buddy's beatings, and
you'll hear why Santana is the most
dynamic group on the West Coast
these days.

Kenneth Clark's Civilisation
Continues Into~ December

If W&L is today what its prede
cessor was 150 years ago, a “focus
of elegant learning,” then it is en-
tirely fitting that we should be
treated during the next eleven weeks
to the now famous film — series
Civisliation, Sir Kenneth Clark’s
masterpiece of cultural — history,
which will be presented each Tues-
day night at 8 o'clock in duPont
auditorium, with admission free for
students, faculty, and (as they used
to put it) Lexington’s “miscellaneous
population.”

This unique film cycle unites bril-
liant and imaginative photography
with Sir Kenneth’s able narration,
sometimes moving, sometimes witty,

which manages to appeal to and
satisfy both intellectuals and peo-
ple. A delicate balance, that! The

audience is offered what must be the
most skillful and wide-ranging tour
of post-classical Western cultural
monuments ever put together. Such
an array of palaces, villas, churches,
libraries, galleries, and much more
-such a wealth of painting and
sculptures—such dazzling musical
accompaniment—surely no one is
entitled to so splendid a command

Settee ett tebeheteteettes

THE

of these riches as Sir Kenneth has
acquired, even in an art historian’s
career so distinguished as his!
Much of Civilisation’s enormous
merit arises from Sir Kenneth’s de
lightful performance on camera
Lord Clark of Saltwood, as he
should be properly styled, is a pro
tege of Bernard Berenson, the sage
of Florence, probably the most
civilized man of our century—and
Berenson’s pupil is as erudite and
cultivated as “B.B.” would have
wished him to be. Beyond that he,

is undoubtedly “a character,” as the
British so often are, certainly the
British elite. His turns of phrase and

his quirks and idiosyncrasies will
arrest an American's atiention, and
perhaps make Americans smile. Ad-
miringly, however,

One is often caught off guard, too,
by Lord Clark’s abrupt appearance
time and again ,on the screen, in the
unlikeliest places—at a lonely river's
edge, on a mountain crag (like Vic
ior Hugo), in a gaudy rococo Ger-
man opera house, or strolling very

possessively through Voliaire’s man-
sion. His impeccable dress, his in

Soccer Team Ties U.Va.,
Ready For Big Season

By PAUL CAVALIERE

The Washington and Lee Univer-
sity soccer team traveled to Char-
lottesville this past Sunday to serim-
mage the University of Virginia,
Washington and Lee came away
with a 3-3 tie against a team that
would not even put W&L on their
schedule for fear of an unimpres-
sively easy victory. The teams play-
ed three 45 minute periods. It was
evident that the W&L attack at
times lacked consistency. The Blue
started out slowly but improved as
the game progressed.

In the first period, Virginia, putt-
ing tremendous pressure on W&L
goalie Paul Devine with a fine at-
tack, scored on a shot by their right
inside. Washington and Lee could
only manage two unsuccessful shots
on the Virginia goal.

Coach Joe Lyles’s pep talk at in-
termission was effective as the Blue
stormed into the lead on two ex-
ceptionally fine goals by Jimmy
Foxx. W&L’s lead, however, was
shortlived as Virginia came right
back with two goals to snatch the
lead, 3-2, as the second period end-

ed, The third period saw Jim Foxx
score his third goal to knot the final
score at 3-3.

Physically the scrimmage was a
costly one for the Generals. Tri-
captain John Buckley © seriously
sprained his wrist, which must re-
main in a cast for two to three
weeks. Despite this John will be able
to work out with the team next
week. Peter Groover suffered a torn
cartilage in his right knee, an in-
jury that might possibly — sideline
him for the entire season. Several
other Generals sustained minor in-
juries.

The exhibition game did provide
our team with the opportunity to
match their talents with those of a
highly touted Wahoo squad. The
Generals found that they need more
drilling in soccer fundamentals. At
times the team was guilty of poor
passing, bad traps, and a lack of
communication among the players.
But at other times, Washington and
Lee displayed the characteristics of
a topnotch soccer team. “Right now
WAL is one of the best, if not the

(Continued on Page 6)

 

 

By PALMER TRICE

“When Washington and Lee’s men
fall in line,

We're going to win again another
time.

For W&L I yell, I yell, I yell,

And for the University | yell, I yell.

We will fight, fight, fight for every
yard,

Circle the end and hit that line
right hard,

And we will roll old Sweetbriar on
the side,

Yes, by God! Rah! Rah! Rah!”

Many people aren't aware of the
fact that the Washington and Lee
Swing is one of the most famous
“spirit” songs in the world. High
schools and colleges across the na-
tion have taken this famous tune and
all that it stands for, changed the
words, and claimed it as their own,

But the Swing did not become
famous just because of its booming
sound, There was an intense athletic
spirit that made it what it was.
Where that spirit is today, I'm not
sure,

College athletic spirit, as have so
many of this school’s traditions, has
been questioned, and apparently
thrown out, Change has been the
password for the past decade, and
it seems that this means that every-
thing old is invalid. Giving it the
“old college try” is no longer in
vogue at Washington and Lee, par-
ticularly in cheering your team on

Last Saturday saw one of the
Generals’ greatest victories in the
last few years, You'd never know it
from the crowd, Wilson Field looked
like a morgue. What has happened
to enthusiasm for one’s school? For
years, people have said that all the
school needed to regain this lost
spirit was a winner, Now we've got
two.

Why do people feel embarrassed

WEL's Spirit Is Missing

 

vy

when they want to cheer for their
school teams? I can understand why
you wouldn't want to start a cheer,
but why not join in? It can be real
fun. I've heard so many students
say “No, I don’t want to cheer.
That's so high school.” When you
grow up, do you abandon everything
that was yours in the past?

What has happened to the great
emphasis put on individualism? In-
dividualism means going your own
way. It doesn’t necessarily mean
that one has to avoid doing some-
thing that others are doing. Spirit
has its greatest impact when it is a
group effort, But this effort is only
so spirited as the individuals allow,
At the root, spirit is a personal
issue,

From the way it has been treated,
it would seem that school spirit, i.e.
cheering at a football game, is a
real chore. It isn't. Some of the
greatest moments in a college career
can be found in the stands on a
Saturday afternoon, Picture this: A
crisp fall afternoon. You have a
beautiful, good, decent date. Flask
is in the hip pocket. You are sur-
rounded by friends, and by people
who share the same “spirit” as you.
Down front, there’s a good ball
game. It may be old fashioned, but
this can be the scene for some great
times.

Many things can be done to create
a situation more condusive to school
spirit, The school could definitely
use a respectable recording of the
Washington and Lee Swing. Cheer
leaders and maybe a Spirit Club
might be beneficial additions.

But none of these will help, un-
less we have a change of heart. The
change must be one that takes place
in individual students. Only then,
can it become a trait of the school
as a whole.

Generals Win In Upset;
Grab 21-14 Victory From
Surprised Westminster

By LEWIS HIXSON

IUs going to be a good season for
Washington and Lee this year if
last Saturday's performance was any
indication of things to come. A 21-
14 victory over a nationally ranked
small college team is always a hard
act to follow, but that’s what the
Blue have looked forward to after
their comeback victory over the
Westminster ‘Titans last Saturday
here at Wilson Field.

After a rather sluggish first quar-
ter, the rest of the game belonged
completely to the Blue, It started
out with Westminster winning the
toss and after each team had ex-
changed punts, McNamera went to
work for the Titans. He drove his
team 78 yards in 9 plays with the
big gainer coming on a 45 yard pass
to Cole. The touchdown came on a
four yard burst up the middle by
Griffiths. McNamera added the
point after and with 6:51 left in the
first quarter the Generals had drop-
ped behind 7-0,

That wasn’t all the action in the
first quarter. After returning the
kickoff to their own 39, the Gen-
erals once again tried to get rolling.
However, they barely got going be-
fore misfortune struck as Bill Bald-
win fumbled a Fluharty pass and
Pontius recovered on the W&L 46,

This time it took the Titans just 6
plays to score as Fitts got behind
the Blue secondary to pull in a 34
yard scoring toss. McNamera once
again added the extra point, and with
4:13 still left in the quarter the Blue
were down 14-0, and the Titans
were looking very strong.

However, the Generals took the
kickoff determined to prove they
weren't out of it yet. Fluharty set
up shop at his own 25 and proceed-
ed to lead the Generals to the Titans
9 in eight plays. Following a 4 yard
loss, Fluharty elected to pass on
second and goal from. the 13, but
the bid fell short as the pass was in-
tercepted in the end zone.

Nevertheless, the Blue refused to
quit and Mark Diverio gave them
new life when he intercepted a Mc-
Namera pass and returned it to the
Titan 38 to open the second quar-
ter’s action. On second and 11 from
the 39, Fluharty flipped a short pass
to Jim Farrar, who broke three
tackles in route to the Westminster
3. Two plays later Fluharty sneaked
it over from the two. Doug Chase
blew the extra point, but the score
had been cut to a 14-6 margin. The
rest of the half was played between
the two 20's, with neither team be-
ing able to mount any sort of a
threat,

1972 Football Schedule

The second half began with the
Generals receiving the kickoff and
then losing the ball on a fumble at
the Titan 45, However, Westminster
was kind enough to reciprocate as
they gave it back at the W&L 25 on
a fumble of their own, Fluharty
then put the pieces together and
took the Generals on a 76 yard
scoring drive. He mixed passes with
runs by Van Amburgh and himself
to get to the Westminster 3, where
Van Amburgh plunged over. Coach
Leslie then elected to go for the two
point conversion to try and tie it up.
The Blue were successful as Conrad
took the 3 yard roll out pass from
Fluharty needed to knot the score
at 14-14 apiece. That's the way the
quarter ended as the W&L defense
continued to keep the Titans out of
scoring range.

In the fourth quarter the Titans
were the first to make a serious
threat, as they drove to the General
21 in 13 plays, before stalling with
a 4th and 11 situation. In came their
place kicker but his attempt at a
37 yard field goal fell short and the
Generals were able to breath a little
easier, It seemed like neither team
could gain an advantage until W&L
got a break late in the game. David
Turk intercepted a McNamera pass
and returned it to the General 49.
Fluharty then called three running
plays which netted only 7 yards.
This brought up a 4th and _ three
situation, at the Westminster 44, At
this point, Chappy Conrad told Flu-
harty that he thought he could beat
his man deep. With time out, QB
Fluharty went to the bench to con-

TeSys

 

First of all, Army ROTC only takes up about
three to five hours a week of your time while you're in college.
No big thing.

Second, it gives you an edge on the other
guys. In areas like management, organization and leadership.
No big thing.

Third, it pays $100 a month during your junior
and senior years. No big thing.

Fourth, it lets you serve your country as an
Army Officer. No big thing.

But the big thing is that little things add up. The
education, the background,
the experience.

Right now you may
think Army ROTC will look
small on your resume, But a
lot of employers don’t think so,
And with jobs getting tougher
to come by, a little thing like
ROTC can start to look
pretty big.

fer with Head Coach Buck Leslie.
The play that followed can only be
described as possibly the most ex-
citing play in W&L history. Flu-
harty took the snap and faked into
the line drawing most of the Titans
defense to that spot, and then drop-
ped back and found Conrad all
alone downfield with a 44 yard
scoring pass, The play was remini-
cent of a similar call that occurred
in the October 15, 1969 Texas-Ar-
kansas game, which gave Texas the
national championship, Doug Chase
added the extra point and with only
1:59 left in the game, W&L was on
its way to a major small college up-
set. Two hurried attempts by the
Titans were laid to waste as Mar-
shall Washburn and Diverio inter-
cepted desperate passes.

Although the big plays always
seem to involve just a couple of
players, it must be remembered that
there are 11 men on the field. The
offensive line did an excellent job of
blocking for the backs as well as
giving Fluharty excellent protection.
Special commendation in this area
goes to Tackle Bob Brand. The de-
fense also must be congratulated as
they held the Titans scoreless in the

‘Civilisation’ Film Series
Is Clark’s Masterpiece

(Continued from page 3)
vincible aplomb, his knowing smile
which never quite turns patroniz-
ing: these are with him always and
everywhere, and many will ask at
the end of each film, ‘why can't I
be more like him?’

It seems today especially impor-
tant for students to absorb as thor-
oughly as possible and as_ intelli-
gently as possible some of the spirit,
and not just the barebones ‘history,’
of the West's cultural traditions,
This is so, partly because the techno-
logical revolution of the past 25
years dominates more and more
contemporary programs of education
—and the many comforts of modern
life will bring only faint joy to those
who do not know and cherish the
arts.

And partly because the cultural
relativism in vogue these days has
led to the deliberate discounting of
Western canons of traditional cul-
ture, in every field, among the in-
telligentsia on both sides of the At-
lantic. “Cultural chauvinism” is per-
haps the gravest of crimes in the
modern academy, and Lord Clark,
conservative that he is in matters of
taste and in many of his views,
would nevertheless be embarrassed,
very likely, to find his Civilisation’
defended on chauvinist grounds.

Let that be as it may; even so,
Zen Buddhism Hindu epics, and
(surely!) sub-Saharan sculpture will
never seem quite the same again
after Lord Clark's stirring portrayal
of our culture’s greatest moments.
Pride may be a sin indeed; if it is,
it is the most tempting one of all;
and the sons of Western civilization
can be pardoned for yielding to it.

tobacco-chewing marine, have per-
formed creditable deeds in keeping
their teams in contention, with the
Yankee’s restoration a very welcome
surprise,

Through a humid east coast sum-
mer and into the late days of Sep-
tember, these clubs surged and
slumped at a bewildering rate. With
only a handful of games remaining,
no one team appears capable of
capitalizing on the weaknesses of
the other three.

Due to the lingering players’
strike, an uneven number of games
further clouds the eventual outcome.
There exists a distinct possibility

that no legitimate champion will
hack its way through the clutter
without incurring a stigma resulting
from the disrupted schedule.

Yet the much-maligned aspirants
plod onward to the accompaniment
of lusty cheers and embarrassing
jeers from their confused followers.
The season will soon stumble to a
close, leaving players and fans to
dream of a next year, mystical im-

petus of the summer game which
aging boys undertake with fond
passion,

Defeat finds comfort in the vic-
tories that have been enjoyed and
in those to come. Mediocrity of per-
formance can be forgotten, inept-
ness playfully heckled. Sadly enough,
the costly games of November,
waged by men of a difficult uniform
and skill, looms before the shaken
American public as a painfully simi-

September 27, 1972

lar spectacle of violated principles
and fallen causes.

People will forget the mediocrity,
or at least try, unless trapped by its
treacherously sublime impact; heck-
lers will raise cries in the direction
of the stone-eared, The President's
glorious mandate will deservedly
inspire four more years of direction-
less politics, following a credo strip-
ped of idealism, Cynics shall pros-
per, haunted not only by this year’s
mismatch, but by the upcoming
nightmare which proposes to pit an
outspoken vice president and a solid
aristocrat in ignoble struggle.

And I, with a mind battered into
retreat from reality’s stage, cast a
glance toward another summer, an-
other season, with hope, And de-
spair. The two are sweet com-
panions in an age which holds them
so cheaply.

Coach Lyles. “Every other ball club
has lost many players due to gradua-
tion, but we have lost no one. This
is the year for a championship soc-

Soccer opens its season this Sat
urday at Eastern Mennonite. The
following Wednesday the team has
its home opener with Madison Col-
lege. As was said of the W&L foot
ball team last week, this team will
be tested early, Championship cali-

Honor System Taken for Granted

By WATSON TEBO

In the opening convocation, Presi-
dent Huntley challenged W&L to
maintain its “community of trust.”
The Honor System, or our “com-
munity of mutual trust,” is some-
thing entirely unique to W&L. The
point of my article will be to show
freshmen (and some upperclassmen)
that what we often take for granted
here is something which no other
college campus | know of can offer.

This summer | attended Tulane
University in New Orleans. Nothing
special in itself, but the lack of any
honor system and the complete lack
of any sense of mutual trust among
students, professors, and campus
officials annoyed me. Tulane is, of
course, a much larger school in a
large metropolitan area, but I feel
there could be more mutual trust
than there is.

| shall point out some specifics
such as our library checkout system.
WA&L students can carry in parcels,
knapsacks, and briefcases and carry
them out without fear of being ac-
cused of sneaking out books. At Tu-
lane, there is a guard at the only
exit from the library. He not only
checks all packages and briefcases,

but inspects each individual text to
make sure it is checked out properly.

Many people never give a second
thought to the fact that tests are
never proctored at W&L. In fact,
during final exams I have often left
the room at my leisure to get a Coke
or some fresh air. For many of our
exams, the student is allowed to
choose where he would like to take
it, and he can schedule the time of
the exam himself. Tests at Tulane
are proctored and scheduled for you.
It’s just, too damn bad if the univer-
sity schedules four exams in two
days for you. And don't think it
never happens that way. I heard too
many students at Tulane this sum-
mer bitching about it.

It is a real pleasure to know that
you can browse around the W&L
co-op without automatically being
suspected of shoplifting. At Tulane,
all books and packages must be left
outside the bookstore/co-op. And
if you make the mistake of carrying
a briefcase in with you, the manage-
ment will apprehend you faster than
they would a rapist or murderer.

Something I have noticed in our
co-op has impressed me greatly—of-
ten the crowd gets quite large dur-
ing peak hours, particularly lunch,
and the cash register will not ring
fast enough to handle all the incom-
ing change. | have seen many stu-
simply leave the correct
amount of change for an item they
purchase on the counter and leave
After the crowd clears, you can see
little stacks of coins spread over the

dents

counter being collected by the
cashiers.

At Tulane, it's strictly one-way
toll booths; once you are in, you

cannot leave until you pay, no mat-
ter how busy the co-op might be.

As I have said, our community
at W&L is blessed with a mutual
trust among students and faculty.
Not only are your actions respected,
but your word is honored.

At Tulane, for example, there is
no pledge for a test on paper; they
simply do not trust you. They watch
you while you take a test instead of
taking your word as a gentleman.

This summer. | found what it was
like to not have your word honored.
A special Saturday session for my
class at Tulane was called, so my
friend and | showed up at 7:45 a.m.
dressed in the usual college attire for
summer classes, carrying physics
books, notebooks, and slide rules.
As we entered the science building,
a campus policeman (armed) was
stationed at the security desk. He
requested to see our identification
cards, We explained that we were
attending our physics class, as usual,
except that the professor had called
for a special class that morning. The
guard did not take our word for it,
and again he requested to see our
picture ID cards in order to prove
we were summer students at Tulane.
Again, we attempted to explain that
we were not vandals or arsonists,
and that we only wanted to go to
He still refused to believe us.
We produced our ID cards which

Petitions
Freshman

By JOHN F, ZINK

The Executive Committee covered
a variety of subjects in its regular
meeting on Monday ranging from
reports by the standing committees
and final budget proposals to the
announcement of the up-coming
freshman class elections.

Stan Taylor, Cold Check Com-
mittee chairman, reported that he
had thoroughly explained the pur-
pose of the committee to freshman
during orientation. Ted Blain, also
of the committee, stated that the
committee mow has a reserve of
$460. Taylor said, “We are plann-
ing to visit merchants in town this
week to begin picking up bad
checks.” The EC then heard from
Mark McMinn of the Film Com-
mittee.

McMinn presented a list of about
25 films to be shown during the
year. “This list has been compiled
from the many requests submitted
by students,” McMinn explained.
The list includes old American
classics as well as international pic-
tures. McMinn stated that the film
program cost about 6.2 cents per
student per film.

Dick Marsh of the Curriculum
Committee reported the recent acti-
vities of his group. Marsh explained
that his committee is attempting to
have the Sociology and Music de-
expanded, extend the

nasium, and hopefully the over-
crowding which occurred at con-
certs in the old gym will be a thing
of the past.

Richard Middleton is the presi-
dent of this year’s Dance Board,
while Jay Taylor serves as the vice-
president of the organization.

drop/add period, and change the
procedure for obtaining a double

The EC then moved to the final
arguments on the budget proposals
for the '72-'73 year. The committee
finally divided up the $17 campus
tax as follows: Calyx, $5.50; Ring-
tum Phi, $3.18; Expense of Fund,
$.30; EC, $.65; Student Bar, $.45;
Ariel, $1.00; Film Committee $.90;
Reserve Fund, $.3778; Publications
Board Reserve Fund, $.7967; Con-
tact, $3.00; and Law Newspaper,
$.9455,

Lewis Powell, EC secretary, com-
menting on the upcoming freshman
class elections, suggested that pos-

University Psychologist
Begins His First Year

“My role is to provide an ave-
nue for students to get professional
psychological advice in working out
their personal problems, both the
serious hang-ups and the not so
serious ones.” With this outlook, Dr.
James Worth begins the year as
Washington and Lee's first full-time
psychologist.

Dr. Worth, a native of Dayton,
Ohio, has had intense but broad ex-
perience in the area of mental
health. His arrival on campus this
fall was the culmination of efforts
by the university faculty and admini-
stration to provide a better coun-
seling service for members of the
university community

“| want to stress that the people
who will be coming to see me are
not necessarily those who we de-
fine as ‘mentally ill." Worth insist
ed. In fact, he expects the vast ma-
jority of cases to be students who
have relatively normal types of prob
lems.

“TH be talking with guys about
everything from sexual problems of
anxieties to family pressures from
home. Some may simply want some
advice on making their career
choice.” Worth emphasized he would
be available to
with WAL. including perhaps a stu
dems wife or girlfriend, or a mem-
ber of the faculty or staff

Dr. Worth’s office is located in

he said, an appointment can be made
with Mrs. Addie Payne, the recep-
tionist behind the University Center
lobby window, or by calling Ext.
299. “In an emergency, I'll be avail-
able day and night.”

Dr. Worth has spent the last three
and a half years as a clinical psy-
chologist in a comprehensive mental
health center at South Bend, In-
diana. There he worked with stu-
dents from Notre Dame and Si

Worth added. He anticipates that he
will be teaching at least one, poss-
ibly two, courses here at WA&L.

He received his degrees at Ohio
State, University of Missouri, and
the University of Northern Colo-
rado, where he was trained in school

OUTLOOK andREVIEW|
The Battle For The Arts (Part IT)

Little did we know, when we spied a certain deficiency
of tennis facilities a couple weeks back, that we would thereby
provoke the W&L Muse to rear her head and to proclaim the
neglect of the arts here. Mr. Buch’s well-argued and impas-
sioned article has now been followed by a similar plea from
freshman Ron Harr, who makes the claim (in a letter which
appears elsewhere on the page) that there has been curricular
neglect in the journalism department as well.

The sentiments of both these men obviously are shared by
many other students in their respective fields; both raise im-
portant questions about university priorities. And we endorse
their contention that present facilities are terribly inadequate
to meet present and future student demands.

But we are not convinced that, as was implied in Mr.
Buch’s essay, these inadequacies are due to a pro-jock, anti-
art bias in Washington Hall. As he himself observed, enroll-
ment in these courses of study has increased phenomenally
over the last few years. For this very reason, it is understand-
able why university planners were caught so completely off-
guard.

A major has been conferred in Drama only since 1970. It
is true that the University Theatre cannot provide the class-
room or the workshop space necessary for the present num-
bers. But enrollment in drama courses in 1969-1970 merely
totalled 148 students; it shot up to 205 the following year, and
to 249 last year,

[t is true that classes are grossly overcrowded and listen-
ing facilities overtaxed for the Music curriculum, Yet there
were only 138 men taking music courses in 1969-1970; last
year there were 301, The same, of course, is true for classes in
studio art and art history.

The point of all this is to demonstrate that the need for
a major arts expansion has not been so compelling until quite
recently. When the university determined to fulfill the long-
standing requests for a gymnasium, a new law school facility,
a new undergraduate library and new upperclass dormitories,
they could not have anticipated so fervent an influx of in-
terested students into the arts.

By the same token, numerous journalism students have
complained that their department is understaffed and under-
equipped. Washington and Lee has boasted that it sports the
nation’s only accredited journalism school in a small univer-
sity, they argue, so why is there a strain? Well, perhaps part
of the reason is that there were but seven J-School majors two
years ago. Last year the figure rose to 16, This year there
are 70,

Now Mr. Harr suggests, as well, that, as a prospective
freshman, he was sold on W&L with misleading information,
and this is a different matter entirely. If the administration's
PR apparatus were used to attract music, drama, or journa-
lism students by claiming facilities in these areas which don’t
exist, they would be no better than the gladhanding fraternity
which cannot deliver on the grandiose promises made to fresh-
men during rush, The inevitable result: disillusionment.

The only material, however, that we can find which might
paint an over-rosy picture of what W&L has to offer in these
areas comes in the form of a booklet on Music and Drama
sent out to prospective applicants last year on request, It was
compiled and presented by the department of Music and
Drama itself to recruit interested students.

Finally, we don't mean to pass over the main thrust of
Mr, Buch’s essay, ie., that what we need is a university com-
mitment to the arts if only to justify W&L’s claim to offer a
“liberal arts” education. He calls for a major arts complex to
focus creative endeavors in one physical area,

It is certainly true that, in order to attract good faculty
and good students in the arts, a creditable major must first be
offered, But what he is talking about is integral to the univer-
sity’s conception of what it wants to offer.

Many faculty members lobby just as vigorously that W&L
needs a graduate program in a variety of fields, others say we
need a school of engineering or an architectural program
These involve major changes in the nature of the university
and have been resisted for that reason,

Mr. Buch says we cannot rely on the arbitrary good will
of the administration. We say that we not only cannot but
should not rely on the administartion to abritrarily decide
what W&L is to be

come an arts center, or a graduate school, or a coed institution

whether it is arbitrarily decided to be

These major questions of direction must remain for the whole
university—its students, faculty, administration, and alumni
to determine.

We agree with Mr

strong in the arts, These subjects can no longer be treated as

Buch that W&L can and must become

extra-curricular activities. But just how much emphasis shall

he placed on this is not up to Mi Buch, or to us, but rather to

Letters
To the Editor

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

I was recently impressed by an
article in the last edition entitled
“The Pathetic State of W&L Arts”
by Gregory Buch. What Mr. Buch
had to say about space for the study
of dramatics did not directly bother
me because | have never pursued
the art of drama, but his statements
about the overall attitude towards
creativity and the arts has bothered
me since my arrival here this fall.

One of the primary reasons that
I came to W&L was the fact that it
was one of the only small, private
universities in the South with a
journalism school of some renown,
| was particularly interested in
photo-journalism because I have de-
cided that my career will be some
type of photographic endeavor. I
was told during interviews, conversa-
tions, etc. that there was ample op-
portunity for me to follow my
photographic interest at W&L.

Upon my arrival here I sought
asylum from the initial confusion
by enrolling in the ranks of the
Calyx photographers. | hoped that
| would be assigned to one of the
several darkrooms that | had been
told about before I arrived here.
Little did I know that the Calyx,
Ring-tum Phi, and Law paper all
share the same darkroom in the
basement of the old dorm.

My high hopes were immediately
shot down by a trip to the “publi-
cations darkroom.” It looked ex-
actly like what it was—a converted
trunk room in the basement of the
old dorm behind the janitor’s closet.
Dust, disrepair, and rust were pre-
valent everywhere. Dust, the great-
est enemy of the modern photo-
grapher, was billowing forth from
every nook and cranny, including
the over-head sewage and heating
pipes.

The disrepair of the equipment
such as enlargers and dryers was to
me incredible, Rust was either form-
ing or had formed on virtually every
piece of metal in the room.

My only encouragement was that
the other photographers were almost
as displeased as | was, After leav-
ing my Sociology class in the new
science building, which looks and
even smells like the most antiseptic
of hospitals, | would never have
believed that such a place as the
“publications darkroom” existed.

To the list of deficiencies that Mr.
Buch found in the Art and Drama
departments, let me add the need
for several student darkrooms.

| will be the first to agree that
the education of a photographer, or
any other man, should include many
of the academic pursuits, from aero-
bics to Aristotle, that W&L has to
offer, but I do not think that he
should be forced to forget about f-
stops, shutter speeds, and exposure
values for four years while he pur-
sues his academic material, | also
do not think that he should be fore-
ed to “mark time” in his photograp-

hic achievement because the Uni-
versity lacks the proper facilities

Reach-Out was suggested two
years ago by students concerned
about drugs on campus and the ab-
sence of a 24-hour counseling serv-
ice, VMI donated the present facil-
ity known now as the Rockbridge
Area Problem Center.

The drug scene in Lexington is
thought to be heavy by the R. O.
staff althofgh calls concerning
drugs are not numerous, “People
who are into drugs usually take care
of themselves,” I was told by a
staffer who identified himself as
“Max.”

Today the majority of the staff
is nonstudent; the majority of the
calls come from the  nonstudent
population and concern not drugs
but poverty. Among other things the
staff secures transportation for low
income residents of the county.

For an organization that claims
to be desparately understaffed,
Reach-Out requirements are high.
Applicants are first screened to find
out if they can make a caller com-
fortable and obtain his confidence.
lhey must then complete a 36-hour
course on community and interper-
sonal problems, the physiology and
psychology of drug and alcohol
abuse, first aid and counselling tech-
nique.

Until more persons are trained,
Reach-Out will operate on a 12-hour
basis. Calls after 10 p.m. receive a
taped reply at the end of which the
caller may leave his own message.

Ken Lane describes Reach-Out as
a means of tearing down the “walls”
between the university and the
town. These “town vs. gown” ten-
sions have been historically appar-
ent, ever since a three-day riot be-
tween students and villagers rocked
Oxford in 1355, That particular epi-
sode resulted in a penance required
from the city to the university until
1825.

Perhaps the situation in Lexington
is not quite so severe, yet Reach-
Out's purpose stands as a less vio-
lent form of community interactions.

‘Vinegar Joe’ Is Sweet Music

By W. PATRICK HINELY

Vinegar Joe
Atco SD 7007

It's not often a new band comes
out with a first album which con-
tains more than about 25% worth-
while music, Such records, though,
are worth looking for, and it was
with great pleasure that I found
Vinegar Joe.

The album was recorded in Lon-
don, so I assume these people are
English, though they don’t have ac-
cents in their vocals, If they are Eng-
lish, they're the best thing to come
out of the U. K. since Emerson,
Lake & Palmer got together.

They're not entirely original in
style on a couple of cuts, but they
are competent musicians who recog-
nize their own bimitations and work
within them quite well. “Rusty Red
Armour” derives much from High-
way 61 period Dylan, both in writ-
ing and singing. With its funky-
greasy instrumental backup, it falls
together quite nicely,

Elkie Brooks is the best female
vocalist to surface in England since
Sandy Denny. She might think she’s
a limey Janis Joplin, and with a
couple of more albums, she very
well could be, Tim Hinkley’s key-
boards are the most outstanding in-
strumental element of the band,
though Pete Gage's bottleneck gui-
tar, especially in “See the World,” is
also worth mentioning. Hinkley’s
opening run on the same cut is as
good as I've heard. The added-on
horns are used just sparingly enough
to add to the music without clutter-
ing the overall sound of the band.

These people play well, have good
lyrics, and blend it all togeather in
such a fashion as to make me say
Vinegar Joe is the best new band
of 1972, though the year isn't over
yet.

By LARRY CAHOON

Six weeks from now, the Ameri-
can people will elect a President.
Perhaps that should read “reelect
a President,” for if the polls are
accurate, Richard Nixon will be
swept back into office with the larg.
est plurality a Republican has ever
achieved, and possibly with a Re-
publican Congress as well, In any
event, it is probably safe to say that
George McGovern is going to be
soundly beaten,

This election, then, being more a
matter of “by how much?” than of,
“who?", it might be interesting to
speculate about the future, specific
ally, the election of 1976. No one
will have incumbency as an advan
tage, and control of at least one of
the major parties will be in some
what different hands, or at
hotly contested

The Republicans, with
Nixon retiring, will see a
struggle between two factions
liberal faction of the Rockefellers
Percy, and others vs, the conserva
tive wing of Buckley, Agnew, and a
host of young legislators now reach
ing power, Both of these wings will
benefit from a massive Republican
victory in 1972, the liberals receiv
ing the support of who, al
though left to Richard Nixon, were
driven into the Republican ranks by
McGovern's extremism, the

the best chance for the nomina

probably depend on what side Nixon
takes during his second term, but
Agnew is still the best bet.

The Democrats face a different
future, George McGovern has made
them the party of the left, with little
room for substantially different view-
points. They will probably face again
the challenge of the right, led by
Connally and Wallace, and made
stronger by McGovern’s loss in this
election, but that challenge will be
thwarted, for the

lead in the third quarter and looked
strong, but fumbles and the inability
to get the ball into the end zone re-
versed the momentum to Centre.
What resulted were two touchdowns
in the final two periods as the Gen-
erals saw their record drop to 1 and
iF

The Blue lost the toss for the
second week in a row, and follow-
ing the kick-off, Centre set up shop
at their own 23. They were unable
to move and punted down to the
General’s 33. The Blue were also
stalled after three plays were un-
successful, and Conrad punted it
down to the Centre 25. The same
procedure occured four more times
for Centre and three for W&L be-
fore the Blue broke out of it near
the middle of the second quarter.
Mike Brittin returned a Centre
punt to their 46 where Fluharty
went to work. After Van Amburgh
hit for 4 on the first play, Fluharty
went to the air. He found Lane on
a 14 yard gain to move the ball to
the Centre 28. Jim Farrar was drop-
ped for a one yard loss but made
up for it on the next play by taking
a pass from Fluharty in for the
score, The pass and run covered 29
yards and gave the Generals a 6-0
lead after Chase’s conversion at-
tempt was blocked.

The second half opened with Cen-
tre setting up at their own 15 fol-
lowing the kickoff. Once again the
Blue defense held strong as Centre
gained only two yards in their first
three plays. Centre tried to punt
out of trouble but failed as Me-
Laughlin broke through to block it
and the Generals gained possession
at the Centre 6. Fluharty then lost
five as he slipped down trying to
pass. However, Van Amburgh am-
ply made up for the loss by slant-
ing the eleven yards needed for the
score. This time Fluharty ran over
for a two-point conversion and the
Generals held a 14-0 lead.

Following the kickoff Centre made

a bid of its own as they drove down
to the Blue 29 in ten plays, but
were stopped at that point follow-
ing a fumble recovery by Nolan.
Two plays later the Generals gave it
back as Van Amburgh fumbled
after a gain of seven on his own 38.
Centre wasted no time as Sykes hit
Ely with a 38 yard touchdown pass
on the first play from scrimmage.
Centre elected to go for two and
were successful as Sykes hit Beck
in the end zone. The Generals mar-
gin was cut to a 14-8 count.

Sykes drove his team down to the
Blue 20 where he ran into a fourth
and 1 situation. The General's de-
fense rose to the occasion and stop-
ped Centre just short of the needed
yardage. At this point, there was
4:36 left in the game and the Gen-
erals had the ball first and 10 on
their own 19, On the first play, Van
Amburgh broke up the middle and
into the open. He traveled 37 yards
before being caught from behind at
the Centre 44. It looked at this
point like the Blue had it made. Flu-
harty sent Farrar into the line twice
netting only two yards. On third and
8 he hit Lane for six yards bringing
up a fourth and 2 with 2:21 left at
the Centre 36. Coach Leslie then
elected to have Conrad try and put
Centre deep in its own territory.
However, Conrad's punt landed in
the end zone and Centre had one
more shot with 2:14 left on the
clock.

Sykes drove Centre to the Gen-
eral 48 where he was put in a fourth
and 6 situation. This time the Blue
defense failed to meet the challenge
and Sykes hit Ely with a 43 yard
pass down to the W&L 5 where
Wallace stopped him. On the next
play Sykes went around end for the
score and the game was tied at 14
apiece with just 38 seconds left.
Berggren came in to try and kick the
extra point to put Centre ahead. He
made it good and Centre had com-
pleted its comeback and held the
lead for the first time in the game.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Booters Win Opener
Ready For Big Year

By PAUL G. CAVALIERE, JR.

This past Saturday, the W&L
Soccer team opened its 1972 season
with a very impressive victory over
Eastern Mennonite College by the
score of 3-0. This was a very big
win for the Generals. They had not
beaten this club in the past three
years. Also, as in any sport, early
victories are a necessary commodity
in so far as they inspire confidence
and team spiirt.

Mike’s best game as far as effort
and skills are concerned,” said
Coach Lyles. Schaeffer's goal made
it 3-0, and virtually put the game
out of reach,

The whole Blue team played an
excellent game. Besides the players
already mentioned, Bob Crawford
played an excellent game at center
half-back. He had very quick feet
and his traps and passes were su-
perb,

From start to finish the Generals All three fullbacks, John Gal-
controlled the game. They lost only yon, Rolf “Aggie” Piranian, and
two things all afternoon—the coin Barclay Armstrong, played  out-

toss and the First Aid Kit. Accord-
ing to Coach Joe Lyles, “the team
played outstanding soccer 85% of
the time. It was a great team effort.”
The first goal was scored early,
with only ten minutes gone in the
first half. Jim Fox booted it in, with
an assist from Bill Spofford. The
other goal in this half was scored
on a direct kick, also by Jim Fox.
This situation developed when a
shot was taken on the goal, which
got by the goalie. As a last ditch
effort one of the Royal Knights de-
fensivemen caught the ball with his
hands and stopped the goal. A pen-
alty kick ensued, and W&L grab-
bed the second of its three goals,

At half-time, Coach Lyles urged
his players not to let the opposition
score even one goal, because with

18 Freshmen
In Monday’s

The first major student elections
will be held next Monday, as fresh-
men will elect representatives for
the Executive Committee, and the
University Council, plus their class
officers.

Candidates filing petitions includ-
ed: for the EC—Jim Davis, Rob
Lindsey, Mike Luttig, Paul Still-
wagon; for President— Ben Barton,
Jay DuRivage, Mark George, Ray

Jones, Leland McCullogh, Robert
Lecky Stone; for Vice-President—
Ronald Harr, Mike Moore, Doug
Muir, Bobby Orkin; for University

Council—Robert Baxley, Alex Bour-
drez, Malcolm Hastings, Bob Kelly.

The election procedure was dis-
cussed in Monday’s regular EC ses-
sion.

Bob Keith, sophomore EC repre-
sentative, moved to raise the ex-
pense ceiling for the freshmen can-
didates from $5 to $7.50; the mo-
tion was carried by the EC and was
further amended to allow an addi-
tional $2.50 in expenditures for any

run-off contests, The $5 limit had
been established by the EC last
week.

Lewis Powell, EC secretary, told

the candidates of the EC’s regula-
tions regarding the elections, Be-

has set several other rules for the
election: a candidate may post a
maximum of 25 posters, he may
only post these in the area of the
frshmen dorms, and he must re-
port will campaign expenditures to
the EC by next Sunday night.

The move this year to limit the
number of posters which a candi-
date may distribute came about as
a result of last year’s EC and class
elections, During these spring elec-
tions, as well as in the fall freshmen
elections, candidates were free to

print up and distribute as many pos-
ters as they wished (while not
spending over $20 for the posters),
The result was that campus columns,
walls, and doors were covered with
well over 1000 posters last spring,
a sight against which many students
and faculty protested.

Bob Brennan, EC president, warn-
ed students after the meeting not to
destroy the campaign posters of the
candidates, Brennan stated, “If you
disapprove of a candidate, don’t tear
down his poster; show your prefer-
ence by voting.”

WGL Law News Begins
First Year Of Publication

Operating from a tiny 5 by 15
foot room in the bowels of Tucker

Hall, The W&L Law News has be-
gun its first year as the law school’s
first official newspaper.

Headed by Editor-in-Chief Toby
Harder, the News will be published
twice a month and distributed free
to students and faculty members in
Tucker Hall.

“Most law schools have a news-
paper,” Harder says. “Il was chag-
rined that we had nothing.”

The idea for a law paper first
developed last year among several
students, headed by Harder. The
students procured money from the
law school’s Student Bar Associa-
tion to begin the paper, and now
the News is being operated on a
budget of approximately $1500 per
year,

The goal of the News, according
to Harder, is to “have an indepen-
dent newspaper with an _ indepen-
dent editorial policy.” The editor
says that the paper will serve to
tell the faculty and administration
of the school what the students
think,

Besides Harder, a third-year law
student, three other law students

Film as art demands knowledge
of the technology that is its back-

editor; Ken Wernick, managing edi-
tor; and Dick Mandelson, business

manager. All are third-year stu-
dents.
The paper itself is published in

a tabloid form. According to Har-
der, the staff has designed the News
to differ, physically, as such as pos-
sible from the Ring-tum Phi. Har-
der wants to emphasize the law
paper as being completely indepen-
dent from the Phi. Besides the dif-
ferent size of the paper, a differ-
ent headline schedule and a differ-
ent type of masthead are employed
by the staff,

The editor-in-chief points out that
the News is definitely the first paper
for the law school. He says The
Lawyer, a magazine-type print
which resembles the W&L Alumni
Magazine, is the only precedent to
the paper. Harder states The Law-
yer is more of a public relations
sheet for the law school, which is
“great for the alumni but not for
the students,”

Harder hopes that the News will
attract interest on the part of stu-
dens, faculty, administration, and
alumni alike, but the paper's main
objective is to serve the student
body. “If it (the paper) enhances
alumni support, fine,” Harder com-
ments, “If not, well, too bad.”

October 11, 1972

Clogging Up The Process

It’s been two years now since Congress and the President
rushed through the bill authorizing the 18-year-old to vote in
elections nationwide, After all the rhetoric and all the argu-
ments (“If you’re old enough to fight for your country .. .,”
etc.) the Kids were finally enfranchised, And now, as Novem-
ber approaches and the candidates trade barbs and accusa-
tions, we college students are ready to be handed the ballot
for our first momentous vote. Right?

Well, not exactly—at least, not here in Lexington or many
other college communities throughout Virginia.

You see, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that
the one-year residency requirement held by many states was
unconstitutional, they also said that individual states still re-
tained the right to decide who is and who is not a resident.

And our dear Commonwealth, friends, is using this loop-
hole to the hilt. All over the state, university students are
meeting up with recalcitrant registrars who bombard them
with questions and then tell them to forget it.

Lexington, needless to say, is hardly an enlightened excep-
tion to the rule. The local registrar, who has been available to
prospective voters but once a week, has succeeded in making
it extremely difficult for W&L men to register, law students
included.

The case of undergraduate senior Pete Howe, whose let
ter to us appears elsewhere on this pages seems pretty typical
of Those Who Tried. First, you're asked if you are a student.
Then, if you answer yes, you're asked about your financial re-
lation with your the
months spent in Lexington. Unless you can prove independ

parents, your insurance, number of
ence from your family and meet other specifications, you go
out the door as politically impotent as when you entered,

Now, the local registrar, of course, has every right to ask
these questions. But the ruling of the State Attorney-Gen-
eral, which allows for these queries, doesn’t specify how the
registrar must act upon that information.

We do understand the view that a student should register
in his home town, where his parents pay taxes and where he,
presumably, would be more affected by local issues, But as
Howe points out, W&L men do often pay rent on a local
dwelling year-round, they do pay a local tax on their automo-
biles, not to mention local sales taxes and a brand-new re-
staurant tax (and, by the way, just who is that one aimed at?).
And in terms of sheer voter awareness, does it follow that a
student should be more familiar with the issues and candidates
in Hoboken, where his parents live, or in Lexington, where he
spends nine months of the year?

The most appalling fact has been the treatment of the
married law students. One senior law student, along with his
wife, was told they could not register, evidently because of
student status. Only after persuading the registrar that he had
been independent from his parents for nine years and intended
to stay in Virginia after graduation, were they granted full
registration. “You've got to be extremely persistant,” he said
later. “What they're doing is effectively dissuading people
from voting.”

Much of the fault lies, however, with students themselves.
If W&L men were really determined to register, they could
perhaps have forseen the local difficulties and registered at
home. But, in many states, application for absentee ballots
cannot be arranged through the mail; often, the absentee pro-
cedure is complicated and wrapped up in red tape itsef,

It's too late for this election. But something must be done
before the next to rectify these unfair obstacles. How can
young people be convinced to “work within the system” when
doing just that is made as difficult as possible?

N.E.P.

Alive And Multiplying

We have a little story that should instill some hope back
into the hearts of those despairing friends of the W&L Honor
System. The other day, the manager of the Bookstore decided
to try to attract some of the Commerce School jocks (“We
usually'don't get too many of them in here,” Bettty Munger
confides ).

Well, what better way to attract young businessmen other
than to shower the display table So
copies of The Wall Street Jungle and Up the Organization,
Mrs. Munger arranged a dollar's worth of pennies

with money. amidst

Several days later, just for fun, the coins were counted, It
turned out that the total had become $1.30

So, Watchdogs of the Honor system, take heart; your
baby is not only alive and kicking in the Bookstore, but
it's accruing interest as well

McGovern vs. Nixon: No Alternative

In our continuing series of articles
on the upcoming election, Bill Me-
Ihaney, head of W&L’s John Birch
Society, explains his support for the
American Party ticket. The views
are those of the writer and not of
the Ring-tum Phi. —Kd.

By BILL McILHANEY

After most Americans return
home from the voting booths next
month, filled with the feeling that
they have taken part in the process
by which they help shape their fu-
tures; there appears to be little
prospect of any interruption in the
plans and programs of those elite
personalities who rule us through
the agency of government. The pre-
tense of a national election will no
more change the leadership and
policies of the Establishment than
could a presidential campaign pro-
mote the discussion of real and re-
levant ideological issues at stake
when its two major contenders
dodge such a public discussion by
the distractions of bugged campaign
offices and running mates with re-
grettable medical backgrounds.

The reason why this year’s elec-
tion cannot produce a real change

of leadership or direction of na-
tional policy is the same reason
why those Americans who most
eagerly seck such a change—and

that comprises most all Americans
are not being presented with any

genuine allernative or even al
lowed to know that such an alter
native exists. Tt would be well to

examine the two categories of vie-
tim into which most Americans will
be forced by the performance in
November

First, there is that large mass of
educated” young people, many of
whom voting for the first time this
year, who have an emotional, amor
phous and largely undefined sub
stitute for a reasoned rejection of
the policies of the Nixon Admini
stration—particularly the frighten
ing and increasingly repressive tot
alitarian power which Congress has
allowed the Executive Department
to assume and which has manifested
itself during the past four years in
the forms of massive increases in
spending Q59% of the en
national debt accumulated by
one administration) with the
skyrocketing inflation;
fuscistic wage and price controls al

deficit
tire
just

consequent

legedly to solve a problem caused
by unconstitutional usurpation of
power by the same government; a
seemingly endless but bloody stale
mate in Vietnam which Nixon has
perpetuated in many ways the in
fringement of basic constitutional

rights through the promotion of the
noknock” provisions of the Om
nibus Crime Act, the fed
eral gestapo now being formed un

incipient

der the name of the Law Enforce-
ment Assistance Administration,
and abortion-on-demand in all mili-
tary hospitals.

Phese signposts of growing totali-
tarian fascism in American have
made Richard Nixon justifiably
feared by many young Americans
And to these frustrated young idea-
lists is presented as an alternative
the Democrat candidate, George
McGovern, The mass media has
painted McGovern as an enlighten-
ed and passionate critic of the
Nixon Administration, and yet, all
he has said he would do if elected
is what Nixon is doing—only pro-
mised to do everything that Nixon
has done while Nixon tried to sound
like Wallace (would Nixon carry
out MeGovern’s promises as well?)

Anyone familiar with George
McGovern’s long record of associa-
tion with Communist fronts and
causes, his long record of histori-
cal ignorance inherent and obvious

in his statements about Commun-
ism, and many other items so juicy
that they strongly tempt mention-

ing, could only conclude that if the
Senator from South Dakota is not
actually a member of the Commun-

ist Party, he must have felt he could
be more effective on the outside!
(For the details, see the opening
article by Alan Stang in the Septem-
ber American Opinion.)

George McGovern's promises of
socialism are just as dangerous as
what Mr. Nixon recently threaten-
ed: that his next four years would
rival even the excesses of usurpa-
tion committed during Franklin
Roosevelt's New Steal. McGovern
being presented to the young as an
alternative to Nixon is as cruel a
fraud as would be committed by a
doctor who asks a patient to ac-
cept leukemia in return for relief
from lung cancer,

However, because McGovern and
his supporters, both academic and
troglodyte, sound so threatening (be-
cause they talk about doing what
Nixon doesn't talk about but does),
many average American adults and
both young and old “conservatives”
will vote for Nixon, if not without
regret, believing that any compro-
mise is acceptable to save America
from George McGovern the Ter-
rible and his comypany of creatures

Well, if Nixon is what he
very smart politician), it might be

‘Malo’ Scores Big In

By W. PATRICK HINELY

It seems like a lot of people have
been down on the Dance Board ever
since I’ve been at this school, It’s
just a mater of pleasing everyone,
a near impossible task. Saturday
night, though, I didn’t see anybody
in Doremus who looked unhappy.

Any doubts one might have had
about this year’s Board were cer-
tainly dispelled by Malo, Those are
real live Chicanos from the Frisco
burrio ,and they sound like it, too,
That fire in the blood, as the bass
player from Eggs over Easy put it,
is something they're born with and
other musicians work for years to
get.

Sound system troubles were the
only real problems that interfered
with the show. Eggs over Easy man-
aged to get around them all right,
and their opening sets were smooth.
We're very lucky that the obnoxi-
ous loudmouths didn’t phase the
musicians; I’ve seen groups walk
off stage from much less harass-
ment,

Eggs is a fairly new band, and
they sound like it, too, They do
have an album out, on the A&M
label, called Good and Cheap, in
case you're interested .

They sing real music. “Snakeskin
Boots” and “I'm Funky” came off
quite well; Eggs has found a good
combination of funk, grease, and
just a litthe of that old-time jukin’
that Dan Hicks uses so well. In fact,
that short-haired feller was playin’ a
guitar like Hicks used to use.

The drummer, known as Dewey
deGrease, used to be with a now
defunct Bay area band called Groot-
na, whose album of the same name

(on Columbia, No. C 31033) has a
much better version of “I’m Funky.”

Eggs over Easy was followed by
a 40-minute break to set up for
Malo and to try to repair the sound
system, Once Malo got going, there
was no stopping them. Hadley Cali-
man, the sax player, had a lot of
trouble with his mike, which was

too bad, because he’s really a pretty
good musician.

Without a doubt, though, the per-
cussion men carried the sound of
the band, Bill Rosales, the tim-
bales player, has some kind of ener-
gy inside him that just flows from
his head, by way of his drums, right
into the heads of the audience. The

the regular 9 minutes of that song
instead of the 344 they managed to

have been chaosed much sooner-—
and probably better.

But they made up for it. Twenty
minutes worth of conga tradeoffs be-
tween Rosales and the black dude of
(whose name | never got) got the
players off, along with the audience.
It was the best spontaneous reaction
between musicians and between
musicians and audience this school
has ever seen,

Harriers Can’t Lose

By PALMER TRICE

While all three fall teams started
their seasons auspiciously, only
the General Cross-Country team has
managed to stay on the winning
track, The Harriers pushed their
record up to 5-0, with a big triple
triumph on Saturday. Coach Dick
Miller's “high hopes” for this club
are slowly but surely being realized.

The Blue opened their season on
the last day of September at Centre
College. In his first collegiate cross-
country meet, Stu Nibley set a new
course record, and led his team to a
23-37 victory. Centre captured the
second and third places, but the
Blue grabbed the next five, as Bill
Kalal, Mike Burns, Jim McMena-
min, Tem Washington, and Bill
Garrison crossed the line. Bob
Sherwood captured tenth for the
Generals.

In their second meet, Nibley led
the Blue over Lynchburg College by
a score of 27-32. The meet was
much closer than expected, as the
W&L striders might have taken
their opponents a bit too lightly.
General runner Mike Burns was ad-
mittedly surprised at the narrow
margin, The meet was at home, and
the win should have been a more

convincing one.

 

But the Blue made up for the
Lynchburg showing in their next
meet. This past Saturday, the Blue
travelled to Roanoke for a big four
team meet against three of their
tougher opponents, The contest was
held at Roanoke’s home course, one
that measures 5.6 miles, and is one
of the longest on which the Gen-
erals will compete this year, Aside
from Roanoke College, the other
teams competing were Christopher-
Newport and a tough Old Dominion
squad,

Roanoke’s Bill Warner took the
lead early, and opened a good sized
lead over the highly-touted Nibley.
Nibley closed fast as the arce ap-
proached its conclusion, Warner's
lead, however, proved insurmount-
able, and he finished the course in
30:05.7, a littke over 15 seconds be-
fore Stu Nibley.

It would be a more than interest-
ing race if these two could meet
again. One W&L harrier commented
that Nibley was not nearly as tired
as the winner was at the finish of
the meet.

Bill Kalal followed Nibley over
the finish line for third place. After
Kalal came Mike Burns in tenth
place overall, Bill Garrison in four-

Junior quarterback Lewis Powell has been named Player of the Week
for his outstanding performance in Saturday’s game, He came off the
bench to hit his first five passes of the game, and of the season.
Powell's performance has prompted much talk that he should and
might well be the Generals’ number one quarterback, This week’s
game against Towson should see No. 15 getting much more action,

Generals Fall To Tigers:

Face Towson

By LEWIS HIXSON

The most evident aspect of last
Saturday's loss to Hampden-Sydney
was that the Generals were out-
manned, It was not mistakes that
cost W&L the game, as had been
the case the previous week at Cen-
tre, but purely the fact that the
Generals met a better team. Coach
Leslie felt that his team had been
up for the game, but not even that
could prevent the Generals’ second
loss of the season by a 34 to 6
count.

It was a tough day all around for
the Blue team, as a strong, hard-hit-
ting Hampden-Sydney defense never
allowed them to get untracted on
offense, This meant that the Gen-
erals’ defense was under the guns
most of the day as the Tigers racked
up 437 yards in total offense, com-
pared with the Blue’s 139,

Steve Fluharty had an off day at
quarterback, completing only 2 of
10 passes. The only bright spot of
the day came when Lewis Powell
replaced Fluharty at the helm late
in the third quarter with the ball at
the W&L 19. On the first play from
scrimmage, he hit Bill Baldwin on
a 16 yard pass play for a first down.

This was quite an accomplish-
ment as it was only W&L’s third
first down of the game, and also the
longest gain in the game for the
Generals. Powell went on to com-
plete his first five passes and guide
the Generals to their only score.
The drive covered 81 yards and took
12 plays, with the touchdown com-
ing on a 29 yard pass to Baldwin.
The extra point was blocked and
at this point Hampden-Sydney led by
a 20 to 6 margin.

The Tigers came right back to
put the game out of reach as Nel-
son took them 62 yards in seven

State Next

plays for the score. After the con-
version, the score was 27-6 and
Hampden-Sydney had it all wrap-
ped up. Jack Berry made an ap-
pearance at quarterback after Po-
well was shaken up on an end
sweep. He did a satisfactory job, as
he completed 3 of 6 for 35 yards,
but had one pass intercepted and
was unable to lead the Blue in for
a score.

There weren't many bright spots
for the Generals but a couple of
players deserve mention. Chappy
Conrad continued to remain among
the national leaders in punting, as
he kicked 8 for an average of 42.4
yards. Bill Baldwin caught three
passes for 54 yards, for the Gen-
erals’ only score,

Lewis Powell should certainly be
considered for the starting quarter-
back, as he completed 5 of 7 passes
for 72 yards and a touchdown, The
offense also seems to exhibit con-
fidence in his ability to move them.
Fluharty was rushed very hard as
he was only dropping back about 4
or 5 yards before attempting to pass.

One reason offered by Coach Les-
lie for Powell’s success and for
“Flu’s” dismal showing was_ that
Powell put more pressure on the
Tiger cornerbacks. His roll-outs
forced them to decide quickly
whether it was run or pass,

The General ground attack man-
aged only 26 yards in 35 carries,
which says quite a lot for the Tigers’
defensive line. Overall, it was a
frustrating day for W&L and one
that should be considered as in the
past so as not to affect the rest of
the season,

Coach “Buck” Leslie said that
even though his squad was psycho-
logically prepared for the ballgame,

New Conference Forms:
W&L Is Charter Member

By RICH KOCH AND
JAMES BAIRD

Washington and Lee University is
a charter member of the new Vir-
ginia College Athletic Association,
an organization designed to promote
more in-state competition among
colleges with an undergraduate male
enrollment of 2,000 or less. The
VCAA, formed earlier this year, is
the result of proopsals for such an
organization by William D. Mce-
Henry, Director of Athletics at
Washington and Lee; Bill Shellen-
berger, Athletic Director of Lynch-
burg College; and Thomas Martin,
Director of Athletics at Roanoke
College. These men felt the need
for an association that would, in
the words of Coach McHenry, “give
an identity to the smaller schools
within the state.”

The question arises now: what
about the College Athletic Confer-
ence? Does the VCAA conflict with
the goals and purposes of the CAC?
According to McHenry, president of
the CAC, there is no such problem
whatsoever. Despite the fact that
the decision of Washington Univer-
sity to quit the conference has re-
duced the membership to four
schools, the CAC is by no means
defunct. Washington and Lee will
continue to participate in all the ath-
letic activities of the conference
while in the meantime overtures are
being made to other colleges simi-
lar in standards to W&L to join the
CAC. A formal invitation has al-
ready been extended to Hampden-
Sydney

Coach McHenry took care to
point out that the idea behind the
VCAA was not an athletic confer-
ence per se, but more a confedera-
tion which would allow member-

schools the chance to participate if
they choose to. The rules state that
each school has the option to se-
lect which sports it wants to com-
pete in so long as it is decided be-
fore September | of that academic
year. Therefore, the VCAA actu-
ally serves as a forum for the
schools, making scheduling of inter-
member contests convenient and or-
ganizing championship events in
each sport. The membership of the
VCAA includes Washington and
Lee, Bridgewater, Clinch Valley,
Christopher Newport, Emory and
Henry, George Mason, Hampton In-
stitute, Hampden-Sydney, Lynch-
burg, Madison, Randolph-Macon,
Roanoke, St. Paul, Virginia State,
and Virginia Wesleyan.

rhe association provides for com-
petition in eleven sports: football,
cross-country, soccer, basketball,
wrestling, swimming, indoor and
outdoor track, baseball, golf, and
tennis. Washington and Lee plans
to participate in all eleven—the
number being left up to the discre-
tion of the individual schools,
Championships will be decided in
each sport by way of a one or two-
day tournament. A unique excep-
tion to this procedure is football, for
which a tournament is impractical.
lo compensate for this the associa-
tion coaches decided to meet at the
each season and on the

schedules and records
choose the outstanding team for the
year, an all-association squad, and
a coach of the year.

The VCAA offers many advan-
tages to its member colleges. Be
sides the convenience in scheduling
athletic events and sponsoring tour
naments, there is the additional ad
vantage of extended publicity in the

close of
basis of

vain on their own. The cost of these

benefits is perhaps the greatest plus
for the new association. The basic
membership price is $100 but a
small participation fee is charged
for each sport with the total yearly
cost not to exceed $175, Team tra-
vel expenses are minimal since the
schools are all located in the Domi-
nion. This last asset is particularly
attractive to the small colleges with
a limited athletic budget, such as
WAL,

Despite the numerous advantages,
the VCAA does not have all open
field ahead of it. In fact, one of its
major strongpoints could become a
fatal weakness. The emphasis on
voluntary participation by the mem-
bers in time could result in disin-
terest and withdrawal from the as-
sociation. But as it stands now, con-
siderable enthusiasm is being shown
throughout the VCAA. If this feel-
ing is continued and transmitted to
the general public, the Virginia Col-
lege Athletic Association will grow
into an impressively competitive or-

ganization.

OAS Plans Sta ged Crisis

Preparations for the W&L Model
Organization of American States
have moved into high gear as “OAS
Weekend”, November 17, 18, draws
near. Held annually since 1968,
Secretary-General Nick Grant ex-
pects the best model simulation in
recent years. He cites high interest
among freshmen and the return of
experienced upperclassmen as_ the
reason for his optimism.

Grant and five committee chair-
men have met each week to lay
plans for the event which expects to
draw participants from such schools
as Georgetown University and the
University of Pennsylvania as well
as Virginia area colleges. A total of
125 people will take part.

During OAS Weekend
send delegations of

schools
two to four

people to represent one of the

twenty-three member nations. Un-
der direction of the Secretary-Gen-
eral, the simulation proceeds, Agen-
das are set, resolutions are proposed
and debate follows. Careful prepara-
tion by each delegation and their
research advisor ensures accuracy,
To test the knowledge of all and to
add excitment, an international
crisis is manufactured while the
OAS is in session.

Delegates, advisors and research-
ers are still needed, Anyone inter-
ested should contact Nick Grant at
463-2773 or attend the next dele-
gates meeting on October 19 in the
WA&L Student Center, room 114.

For those interested in observing
the proceedings, the floor will be
open during the entire simulation.

All three meets proved to be very
close. Washington and Lee edged
Old Dominion 27-28, beat Christo-

to say, the Blue have proved their
mettle.

Looking to the future, the Blue
take on VMI and Davidson on the
sixteenth of this month, at David-

one. VMI, especially, has had very
good teams for the last two years,
and is reputed to have another.

tresses so impenetrable to the les-
sons of history as National F. Re-
view, Jr. Only a “conservative” who
is unable to apply his abstractions
to concrete particulars could vote
for more Nixon dictatorship to avoid
the police state McGovern would
also make inevitable.

He would have to blank out such
matters as the Nixon Administra-
tion’s continuing aid and trade poli-
cies with the Soviet arsenal of the
Viet Cong; the betrayal of Ameri-
ca’s staunchest friend, the Republic
of China, for the purpose of bow-
ing down in utter disgrace to a re-
gime of criminals now controlling
Mainland China, who boast of the
tens of millions of Chinese they
have murdered to hold their power
and who officially harvest and ex-
port most of the heroin now de-
stroying American youth within our
borders; the reduction of our mili-
tary posture to a position finally in-
ferior to the Soviet empire which
our exported western technology so
graciously built over the years; and
on and on,

I do not think I need to add it,
but, for any late arrivals who doubt
my statements—just give me a
chance to show you the evidence!
Those middle Americans and “con-
servatives” who vote for Nixon,
with the best of intentions for elect-
ing the lesser of two evils, will still
be voting for the same evil and
they constitute the second class of
the potential victims of that evil. It
all sounds like what Ayn Rand call-
ed “the sanction of the victim”,
which that he is a victim and the
means by which he could save him-
self,

There is nevertheless a real alter-
native being offered Americans next
month: the candidacy of Congress-
man John G. Schmitz and Thomas
J. Anderson on the American Party
ticket—a_ genuine alternative for
all potential American victims to
the disaster represented by King
Richard and his partner with the
Phd., the nature of which alterna-
tive will be discussed in the second
part of this article.

Soccer Team Loses First Match

(Continued from page 5)
the shots were successful, due to the
outstanding goal-kKeeping of Paul
Devine,

The Blue looked relatively better
in the second half. Their traps and
passes improved, and they seemed
to put the Madison squad on the de-
fensive. Twice the Madison goalie
was beaten, only to have one of
their fullbacks step in to block the
attempted goal. This fine defensive
work seemed to inspire the Dukes,
and with six minutes remaining in
the game Madison penetrated the
tough General defense with a beau-
tifully executed scoring play, W&L
started to lose the initiative when
Rolf Piranian was ejected from the
game for losing his temper when
fouled by an opponent, A series of
unsuccessful goal attempts also frus-
trated the Blue. Time ran out be-
fore the team could piece together a
scoring drive,

After each game Coach Lyles
presents an award to the most valu-
able player in the game. This award,
culled the 110% Award, went to
Barclay Armstrong for his hustle at
the center fullback position in the
Mennonite game. The recipient of
the award for the Madison game was
goalie Paul Devine, who displayed
leadership and finesse at his posi-
tion,

Coach Lyles said of the game,
“Madison has not proven to me to
be the best team in our division,
They should not have won the
game. WAL still has a shot at the
division championship, so we're go-

ing oul to get it.”

In the run-off for Freshman EC representatives are: (seated) Mike Luttig
and Rob Lindsey. In the University Council race are: (standing) Bob

Kelly and Malcolm Hastings.

By PAUL SIMPSON

Iwo candidates for each of the
four freshman class offices will face
each other Thursday in run-off con-
tests,

The failure of any candidate to
obtain a majority of the vote in
Monday’s elections prompted the
run-offs, in which the top vote-
getters in Monday’s elections will
square off for each post.

Out of the original field of six
candidates for president, Ben Barton
and Jay DuRivage will compete in
the primaries, In the other three

posts, where originally four con-
tenders ran for each office, Ron
Harr will oppose Bob Orkin for

vice-president, Mike Luttig and Rob
Lindsey will face off in the Execu-
tive Committee representative run-
off, and Malcolm Hastings will
battle Bob Kelly to represent the
Freshmen in the University Council,

Voting is set for tomorrow and
will be held in the quad from 8:30
a.m.-12:15 p.m, and 1-4 p.m. Special
provision has been made to set up
a voting table in Evans Dining Hall
from 12:15-1 p.m.

Candidates are limited to $2.50 in
expenditures for the run-off cam-
paign in addition to money they
have left over from the allotted
$7.50 for the initial campaign.

In other EC business, it was an-
nounced that the W&L Board of

Trustees unanimously approved the
motion that the President of the
student body shall be invited to at-
tend all three regularly scheduled
meetings of the Board,

Other items discussed were fresh-
man Mike Okin’s proposal for the
buying and selling of new and used
books. He suggested an index filing
system of books for sale. To quote
from Nis letter to the EC”... |
find it increasingly apparent that
this school needs some sort of center
to facilitate the circulation of used
text books,”

Also, the way in which upper-
classmen are to be oriented to the
new public honor trial system was
discussed. After an initial doubt was
expressed by many of the EC mem-
bers concerning the effectiveness of
this measure, it was agreed that
the president, vice president and
secretary would spend a few minutes
in each fraternity house sometime
within the next three weeks to ex-
plain the new procedure and answer
any questions,

In a report given by Bill Merrill
concerning the Publications Board,
it was discovered that both the Ariel
and the Calyx will face financial
difficulties if they expect to carry
out their planned projects. In the
case of the latter, this comes from
the fact that the Calyx came up
several hundred dollars short in their
projected estimate for sitting fees.

Vol. LXXII

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, OCTOBER 18,

1972

W&L Student To Join Trustees

In their meeting on campus this
past weekend the Board of Trustees
voted to invite the student body
president to all future regularly
scheduled meetings, The decision to
include a student in Board pro-
ceedings was unanimous,

According to a statement released
by the Executive Committee, the
president will be permitted to “par-
ticipate in all deliberations and dis-
cussions of the Board, except on
agenda items to be specified by the
Board for each meeting.”

This restriction will effectively
translate into having the student
body representative present for the

vast majority of discussions by the
Board; the Board however reserves
the right to exclude him from some
portion of a meeting in extraordi-
nary circumstances,

hough this safety clause remains,

the current student body president,

Bob Brennan, stated that none of
the Board members this weekend
could conceive of an instance in
which he might be asked to leave.
If such a question arises, the student
president himself would be advised
fully on the nature of the circum-
stance and would also be allowed to
state his objections to President
Huntley and the Rector of the
Board.

Ihe original proposal set before
the Board by the EC was to place a
student as a voting member on the
Board. “We came to understand the

difficulties that would arise from
such an arrangement,” Brennan
said,

Brennan went on to emphasize
that he and future EC presidents

will have “full floor privileges” with
no restraints on vocalizing student
sentiments, even if he has no actual
vole,

The proposal for a student Trus-

by EC Vice President Bill Merrill
last year. It was then taken before
the board at their spring meeting
by Brennan and former President
Steve Robinson; then it went to a

subcommittee for study,

The Board holds three regular
meetings annually, usually two on
campus and one in a city elsewhere.

Brennan applauded the fact that
this action now “gives the Board a
direct source to the student body.”

Exactly What Are They Hiding
Down In The Saunas, Anyway

Who knows what evil lurks in the
heart of W&L’s saunas? Athletic
department officials do, or so they
say.

According to these officials, the
opening of the saunas has been de-
layed, since September, by a faulty
mechanism in the sauna electrical

system,
A WAL electrician apparently
was unable to repair the mech-

anism, so the university had to send

away to the company which built
the saunas for a new part,

Wherever that company is locat-
ed, it must be well off the beaten
paths of the post office. For well
over a month has elapsed since the
opening of school, and since the
discovery of the faulty mechanism.
And still the part has not arrived.

But the continued inoperative
state of the saunas has prompted

| Walk For Hunger Nets
| $2,700 For Proverty Aid |

“Walk for Hunger and keep on
Trucking.” And 38 W&L students,
30 VMI cadets and over 300 towns-
people did just that Saturday to
raise money for CROP, a hunger
program of the Church World Ser-
vice. The Reverend Renwick Ken-
nedy of the Ministeral Association
of Buena Vista was the ostensible
organizer of the march.

The idea was that the walkers
would be paid a certain amount for
each mile by a sponsor, For those
walking for a nickel a mile, it was
a true labor of love.

Frank Porter, the leader of the
student march Saturday, which pre-
ceded the march of the townspeople,
said that combined efforts yielded
over $2,700. Twenty-five per cent of
the money will stay in Rockbridge
County; the rest will go to hunger
programs all over the world.

“it's really the best way to raise
money because it’s so obvious to
people what you are doing,” Porter

Number 5

  
  
 

said, “At the same time you are
letting people know you're concern-
ed.” Although there were no real
spectators, many students were more
than willing to pay to see their
fellow students harrangued into
walking ten miles

CROP is only one of many func-
tions of The Church World Service,
which acts as a clearing house for
anti-poverty programs, It primarily
collects clothing and distributes it
in needy areas whether they are
“poverty” areas or disaster areas like
Biafra or Bangladesh where CWS
has been quite active, in recent
months,

With the exception of Sigma Chi,
which contributed $20 and partici-
pants, fraternity houses did not turn
out in force. Pi Kappa Phi contri-
buted $20 to the cause of the hikers,
most of whom were freshmen.

A similar Hike for Hunger is
planned in Lynchburg this coming
Saturday.

New Student Influence

We rejoice at the announcement of an action taken by the
Board of Trustees last weekend to allow a student to sit on
the Board as a non-voting participant. This comes as the

October 18,

result of a long-standing effort headed by last year’s student
body president, Steve Robinson, and the current one, Bob
Brennan. Henceforth, the student president will be allowed
to attend board meetings and to exercise full floor rights.

What this means is that a student voice will be heard on
crucial issues which has never been heard before. Although
the request originally suggested the student be a voting mem-
ber, we acknowledge the complications that could arise in
such a case and we support the current arrangement.

Previously, the student body president has been merely
permitted to give a brief report to the Trustees on student
affairs; the importance of this change, therefore, should be
obvious. While it may not translate into real student power
in determining university policy, it does go a long way in
providing considerable student influence.

Registering To Vote (Cont.)

One day last week, a third-year W&L law student was
humming down the road on his way into campus from his
country apartment. Suddenly, a roadblock loomed ahead. He
pulled over, and a policeman sauntered over to his window.

“We're checking for county tags,” the cop said; he then
proceeded to write out a ticket for the deinquent student,

“But look,” said the student. “I've just been down to the
voting registrar. They say I’m not eligible to vote because
I'm not a resident. But then they turn around and say, since
I'm a resident nine months out of the year, I have to pay a
tax for use of the roads. Is that fair?”

The policeman thought a moment, “You've got a point,”
he said, “Why don’t you take it to court?” And that’s pre-
cisely what the student intends to do.

Now, this local double standard may, in fact, be technically
legal. But still, the big question remains as to whether or not
this is fair.

On the final day for registration of new voters in Lexing-
ton, between 50 and 100 students were turned away by the
city registrar. Meanwhile, the county registrar was granting
students a temporary registration, which allows them to vote
in the Presidential contest only.

But the very fact that the city and county registrars were
acting in an entirely different manner toward student appli-
cants points to the acute problem students in Virginia are
faced with. That is: the ruling of State Attorney-General
Miller perverts the intentions of the extended franchise by
placing too much control in the hands of individual local
registrars. They may, in essense, set their own criteria for
determining what constitutes “residency.”

Two Washington and Lee law students, Doug Schwartz
and Dave Shapiro, are attempting to file a suit with the fed-
eral courts which would force the local registrar to open up
for another week before the election to allow for the issuance
of temporary registrations. If they succeed. W&L and VMI
students who have not already registered would have the
chance to vote, even if only for the presidential ticket.

Schwartz and Shapiro claim that the city registrar has
acted in violation of the 1965 Voter Rights Act by delivering
a “special line of inquiry” to students here. But to file a group
action, they need fifty students to identify themselves as hav-
ing been refused by the registrar; at last count, they were con-
siderably short of that number.

What we don't understand is what Lexington is afraid
of. Certainly in some university communities, like Berkeley,
Cambridge, or Chapel Hill, massive student enfranchisement
could have considerable effect on local politics, But can you
imagine students taking over in Lexington?

As we stated in these columns last week, absentee voting
by mail is a difficult and bureaucratized process. While there
still may be time for students to apply for absentee ballots in
most states (and we urge them to do so), we think it is sad
that Lexington has chosen effectively to keep the vote from
student hands.

Joe Character was what many
would call a typical W&L student.
He had graduated from high school
blending a high level of academics
with a fair amount of athletic
prowess. Although Joe was mod-
estly quiet and from a small north-
ern town which did not focus on a
big social life, he still was an ami-
able fellow, with a good personality
once you got to know him.

Joe followed the majority of his
freshmen counterparts in signing up
for Rush and appeared enthusiastic
at the chance of meeting upperclass-
men, who were involved in the fra-
ternity circle.

After receiving some sound advice
from a friendly upperclassmen, Joe
was able to ease through the open
house registration by eliminating
three fraternities that were avidly
called “aquariums” by many upper-
classmen on campus, When starting
day had arrived Joe followed the
parade of fraternity prospectives
into the quad and waited unassur-
edly for his name to be called for
the first open house date.

Finally the whistle blew and
people began scurrying toward their
particular open house choice, fore-
ing Joe to note the likeness of
Kansas City cattleyards to the mass
herdes wandering in the quad
searching for their fraternity guide.

Upon arrival at his first open
house Joe was greeted by a wel-
coming committee consisting of the
President, Rush-Chairman, an d
housemother of the fraternity. Joe
noted immediately that their were
many smiling girls wandering around
the house with no particular pur-
pose.

At this point Joe received a name
card with his name and his home-
town on it, but felt a twinge of
insecurity as almost nobody had

Matthews Blasts Malo

My Most Esteemed Sir:

With regards to Mr. Hinely’s
glowing recommendation of the con-
cert last Saturday which featured
Malo [| say Poppycock! Despite
Malo’s obviously apparent advant-
age of being “real live chicanos
from the ‘burrio’” (which means
donkey—barrio means neighbor-
hood), I felt that the concert was
at best tolerable—the wait at best,
annoying—and the music at the very
best, dated,

The concert, slaied to begin at
eight, was grotesquely marred by
the group called Eggs Over Easy
who did, indeed, (as Mr, Hinley
suggests) have sound system difficul-
ties. | take singular pride in being
one of the “obnoxious loundmouths”
who demanded their exit and the
appearance of Malo,

However, had | known exactly
what | was clamoring for, I would
have kept my mouth shut, In any
case, a “good combination of funk,
grease, and a little of that old time
jukin’” is, to my mind, exactly
what their problem was; and that is
exactly why Eggs Over Easy is
comprised of members of defunct
groups.

But on to Malo! Hinley's refer-
ence to the “energy that flows from
Bill Rosales’ head into the audi-
ence by way of his drums” must be
a fancy way of saying headache. |
don't know where Hinely was sil-
ting, but on my side of the whole
bleacher was not really getting into

 

the “contact high” pouring from
those drums,
| do know that when they cut

their “Pana” number short, | heard
a sigh of relief from about thirty
people which sounded like a late
October nor'easter off Cape Cod

If Malo did in any way “chaos”
people, ‘chaos I presume to be a
state of mind), it was tantamount
to sending them on the blackest
bummer that ever stomped into
their heads, man.

Finally. Mr. Hinely refers the

Joe wondered if this “pick by first
appearance” was actually prejudice
to the section of the country he
came from. Unfortunately in many
cases the answer was yes, After two
weeks of no bids, Joe surmised that

philosophical qustions as: What do
you think of Rush?, How was Na-

official of the School. So we did
a statistical study of the charge ac-
counts in the Bookstore for the pres-

of our accounts were used by Com-

The Commerce majors compose
25.05 percent of the student body,
again excluding freshmen.

Can one draw the conclusion from
these figures that the Commerce ma-

The packed Madison audience
gave Trostle a resounding ovation

remarked,

the most feared experi-
ence is none of these things, In-
stead, it is the dreaded (ta-ta!)
laundramat! Yes friends. the fresh-
man landramat, located in the base-
ment of Freshman Dorm I. If you
have never been down there, it may
be difficult for you to comprehend
the dread and disgust by its in-
fernal presence.

The laundramat looks, at first
glance, like any other laundramat,
except that it is dingier than most
and usually has water running over
the floor. But there are the same
washers, and the same dryers. There
is a machine for detergent, and there
is even a drink machine.

1 remember my first visit. Two
friends and | innocently descended
into the bowels of the so-called
“Jaudramat.” Obviously, the _ first
thing to do was buy the detergent,
Fortunately (we thought) a machine
that screamed “All Your Favorite
Detergents!” drew our attention.
Finding out that “All Your Favorite
Detergents!” meant three different
levers to choose from to get a box
of “Tide” did not phase us in the
least.

So one of my friends put a dime
into the machine and pulled a lever.
Nothing happened. One dime had
been sacrificed to the laundramat.
Would he dare chance the sacrifice
of another? He would.

rhis time, he pulled a different
lever. He got the same result.
Twenty cents were gone, never to
return, One of us went out to the
grocery store on his bike to buy
some detergent. While he was gone,
my other friend began to get thirsty.

His eyes lit on the drink machine.
Ah! Respite for the weary student!
He put 20 cents into the machine.
He pressed a button, As you have
already guessesd, again nothing hap-

didn’t help. By now he had sacri-
ficed 40 cents to the infernal ma-

results. He hadn't even had a chance

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

  

By TOM RADIGAN

Phe goals of an educational com-
munity should not be formed with
ideas of compulsion and _ pressure,
The knowledge that one is hoped
to attain at the university can only
be obtained, finally, through a
dedication to learning and personal
growth.

I have been asked to write con-
cerning the elimination of compuls-
ory physical education within the
context of a school maintaining high
grading pressures, unquestioned pri-
orities, administrative bureaucracy,
and the like. I will try; but what
1 am to say cannot be effectively
isolated from all the events going
on in our university.

We have come to Washington and
Lee adults, in the eyes of our parents
sending us here, in the eyes of our
legal relationship with the nation.
We come here to seek truth, with
a responsibility of conduct to our
fellows. Yet, it would seem in the
eyes of the administrators (specifi-
cally in this case-concerning P.E.)
we are still children, to be guided
and prodded along in an educa-
tonal endeavor.

1 believe that the maintaining of
a healthy physical condition is the
responsibility of every student at
Washington and Lee, as it is for
every teacher and administrator—
every person in all sectors of so-
ciety. The point is, however, that
it is one’s personal responsibility,
in the same way that it is one’s
personal responsibility to pursue a
course of study and obtain a suf-
ficient knowledge of that subject
during his stay at the university.

Certainly one cannot justify the

gages

Sabineen wis Fa
Should It Be Required?

and the tremendous assortment of
faculty from the point of view of
mandatory P.E, courses; one should
not even try. The coaches are there
for the various teams fielded by
W&L; the complex primarily exists
for these same atheletes. Making
P.E. courses optional should not
make the courses more lifeless than
they are now. What it would seem
to me to do would be to open up
the resources of the P.E. department
to groups of students interested in
specific areas of physical education.
It would force the department to
offer courses of interest to the stu-
dents, so that students would sign
up, and so the numbers of gym
instructors would be justified. It
would insure that the students tak-
ing the courses were really interest-
ed in them and not just in class to
fulfill requirements. And it would
give students freedom to make their
own decisions as to whether or
not to exercise, and exactly (in
choosing a program of exercise)
what kind of exercise they wish to
explore. Students taking these
courses would have motivation. The
students would be able to choose
the type of exercise they want,
organized with others, and get pro-
fessional guidance from the depart-
ment, The department would have
to be more open to student sugges-
tions and student inspired courses.
The resources of the gym could be
more effectively utilized to meet the
needs of the university community.

The elimination of mandatory
physical education could set a prece-
dent of freedom of choice coupled
with personal responsibility. And it
is because of this, it seems a crucial
issue.

this reasoning proved faulty.

The W&L’s harriers’ next test
will be a tough one. Bridgewater
comes to Lexington for what
promises to be a close meet. Bridge-
water, early in the season, beat
Lynchburg by more than W&L did
at a later date; however, W&L
defeated VMI by much more than
Bridgewater did.

Coach Miller has professed to
only look at one meet at time. It
is obvious that he and his runners
can’t afford to look past this Satur-
day. But if they do make it past
Bridgewater, what's next?

Tom Van Amburgh set a school rushing record this week in the Towson
State game. He chalked up 202 yards in 35 carries,

Generals Turn Tables
On Towson: Win 38-0

By LEWIS HIXSON

Ihe Towson State contest was
just the kind of game the Generals
needed after two losses in a row,
A 38-0 win was just what the doc-
tor ordered to get the Blue back on
the tract to a winning season, The
offense was poised and efficient as
it ground out 493 yards total offense
and the defense was the perfect
compliment as they limited Towson
to only 108 yards.

Tom Van Amburgh had a great
game as he rushed for 202 yards
and accounted for two touchdowns.
One came on a 54 yard run up the
middle and another when he threw a
30 yard halfback option to Chappy
Conrad for the score. Conrad also
had an exceptional game as he was
on the receiving end of 9 passes for
total of 126 yds. and 2 touchdowns.
His punting, although he didn’t do
it but two times, was very satis-
factory as he had a 43 yard aver-
age.

Steve Fluharty came back from
a dismal performance last week to
a rather good one as he completed
il of 19 for 127 yeards and a touch-
down, Lewis Powell has now pass-
ed for a 73 percent completion
percentage in the last two games as
he hit on 3 for 4 in this game.

The scoring began in the first
quarter when Fluharty led the Gen-
erals on a 43 yard drive in 12 plays.
Van Amburgh bore most of the
burden as he carried 8 times for
29 yards. Fluharty displayed the
Blue's game plan early, as he re-
peatedly sent his runners at the
Towson front wall. The score came
on a one yard sneak by Fluharty.
Chase added the extra point to put
the Generals up 7-0.

The next score came early in the
second period on another long drive.

This one consumed 14 plays. The
touchdown came on an 18 yard
pass from Fluharty to Conrad,

Chase added the extra point to put
the Generals up 7-0.

The next score came early in the
second period on another long drive.

~ The next

This one consumed 14 plays. The
touchdown came on an 18 yard
pass from Fluharty to Conrad.
Chase added his second point of
the afternoon to give Coach Leslie’s
squad a 14-0 lead,

touchdown didn’t take
long at all. Following a Towson
State punt, the Generals set up shop
at their own 31. Van Amburgh car-
ried three times, the first two going
for a total of 15 yards. Then on his
third carry, he went up the middle,
broke to the left sideline, and out-
ran everybody for a 54 yard scor-
ing jaunt. Once again, the extra
point was successful and at the half,
the Blue had a comfortable lead of
21 to 0.

The Blue scored twice in the third
quarter ,the first coming on a 29
yard field goal by Doug Chase, who
had his best afternoon of the sea-
son. The next score was quite a
play. Van Amburgh took a pitchout
and headed around right end. How-
ever, instead of running he pulled
up short and let fly a high pass that
Conrad grabbed, and took in fot
the score. The play covered thirty
yards, and brought back memories
of the old Reeves to Rentzel com-
bination of the Dallas Cowboys.
The extra point gave W&L a 31-0
lead,

The final touchdown came in the
last quarter on a drive engineered
by Lewis Powell. The drive covered
50 yards in 9 plays, with the score
coming on a 4 yard run by Lindsay,
The point after was good, and that
brought the count to 38 to Zip,
which was how the contest ended.

It was a well-played game by the
Generals who needed such a come-
back after their setback to Hamp-
den-Sydney., The defensive line did
a fine job, as they put tremendous
pressure on the Towson QB all day
The defensive secondary did a fine
job, allowing only 4 completed
passes for a total of 17 yards.

Senior Steve Fluharty turned in a
fine performance, one that will cer-
tainly earn him the starting job this

week, But Lewis Powell also per-
formed well, Coach Buck Leslie
seems to be caught in a George
Allen predicament. But as Jimmy
the Greek said this week, “It’s a
nice situation to be in.” Either way
he goes, Coach Leslie will have
fine signal caller,

This week the Blue will be at
Western Maryland in a game which
promises to be a fairly even match-
up. Western Maryland played
Hampden-Sydney last week and lost
by a score very comparable to
W&L’s, 28-6. One observer, a
Hampden-Sydney fan who saw both
Hampden-Sydney games, said that
this one promises to be a real
thriller. Western Maryland did man-
age one score off the Tiger defense.

Saturday's game at Westminster,
Md. is another must game for the
Generals. The losses to Centre and
Hampden-Sydney definitely put an
early damper on the season. This
was to be, and still could be a big
year for the Generals. This Satur-
day could tell the tale.

The Blue Soccer team will pursue a berth in the College Division Tournament when they take on Roanoke
today. The Generals will carry a 2-1-1 record into the game.

Blue Booters Caught By Indiana U.

By PAUL CAVALIERE

The Washington and Lee soccer
team, after a heart-breaking loss to
Madison College, found its winning
ways again with a very exciting 2-1
victory over past state champ Lynch-
burg College. It took W&L until
the first overtime period to hammer
out the win. There was an excep-
tionally large crowd to watch these
two skilled teams play.

The Generals only score during
the regular time period was by Jim
Fox in the first period with only
nine minutes gone in the half. He
was assisted on the play by Bill
Spofford. The entire game was
marked by excellent play on the
part of the Generals.

Lynchburg scored
with fifteen minutes
second half on a shot by their
center forward. Consequently the
regular time period ended in a 1-1
tie. When the two halfs end in a
tie the teams play two five minute
overtimes, Even if a team scores in
the first of the two overtime periods
both must be played. If the game
is still tied after the overtimes it
is written into the books as a tie.

Washington and Lee did manage
to score in the first overtime period,
The score was a beautiful shot by
right winger Mike Schaeffer with an
assist from right inside Jim Fox.
With this goal W&L still had to
stop Lynchburg from scoring dur-
ing the second overtime period,
Once this was done the Generals
walked away with a very rewarding
2-1 victory. The 110% Awards for
the Lynchburg game went to full-
backs Rolf Pirinian and John Gay-
lon for their tremendous defensive
efforts and Mike Schaeffer for his
outstanding work up front.

an entirely different story for the
Generals. Their opposition was
Indiana University from Pennsyl-
vania which has an enrollment of
9,000. Indiana's record was 1-4 be-
fore the Washington and Lee game.
The best the Blue could do was
come away with a 2-2 tie. The
game began under very poor play-
ing conditions because of tis early
starting time. As the game progress-
ed the conditions improved and it
turned out to be a good day for
football, but not for soccer. W&L
led at half-time by the score of 2-0
on two excellently executed goals

Mark Twain

(Continued from Page 3)
Twain. He travels around the coun-
try and to such exotic places as
Europe and South America giving
his impressions of Mark Twain
much as Hal Holbrook does from
time to time on television.”

Trostle, who has had extensive
acting experience, has memorized
some four hours of vintage Mark
Twain and draws from this material
for his ninety minute monologue,
spontaneously adapting his material
to his particular audience.

Besides Twain’s unique sense of
humor and understanding of human
nature, much of the appeal is the
contemporary relevance of the fam-
ous writer’s thoughts and ideas.
Many of Twain’s remarks regarding
politics, man and society seem cur-
rent enough to have been written
today.

Reports columnist Ives: “Twain's
ideas concerning the importance of
man tend to punch holes in the

theory that man is some kind of
sacred being. ‘Man is the only
animal that blushes . .. or needs

to,’ Twain noted, and then added,
‘but you've got to remember that
he was made at the end of the
week's work.”

Wednesday's production is open
to the public, according to Ken
Lane, University Center Director,
“We are putting up publicity in
town and are trying to get the word
to area public schools as well,” he
added. Questions may be addressed
to Mr. Lane, at the University
Center, 463-9111, ext, 299.

Indiana U. Scores Tie
With W@L Generals, 2-2

(Continued from page 5)

was put in the game mid-way in
the first half and immediately scored
on an assist from Branden Herbert.
Later in the same half Embree
scored on an unassisted shot which
caught the upper right hand corner
of the goal. After this goal W&L
seemed to let down and just be con-
tent with a 2-0 lead.

Indiana came back in the second

half for two goals and sent the
game into overtime. Neither team
was able to score during these

periods and the game ended in a
tie. Emotionally it was just as good as
a loss because of the previous record
of Indiana. However it doesn’t hurt
the Generals standing since Indiana
is not in its league. The game was
very frustrating for the Blue since
they took thirty shots on the Indiana
goal as compared to only twelve
taken on the W&L goal. Late in
the game the ball just wouldn't go
in and when it did the refree called
the play back. | am referring to a
goal by Mike Schaeffer which was
called back because of an offsides
penalty.

The Generals record now stands
at 2-1-1. We have two games this
week, both away. Today the team is
at Roanoke College and next Wed-
nesday, October 25, the Generals
are at Randolph-Macon, Both of
these games are going to be tough,
especially the later. Washington and
Lee must win the rest its games with
Virginia Colleges in order to make
the small college tournament.

Mickey Hart left the Dead to go
in a different musical direction after
they did Workingman’s Dead and
part of American Beauty. Since he
left, the Dead have been much more
country-oriented, This is good and
fine, but any competent musician
can do country music. The Dead
are capable of much more.

It's the sort of pure energy-force-
interreaction music that start off
high and gets higher as it goes. No
one but the Dead have really play-
ed that kind of music. Until now.
Cuts like “The Chase” and “Deep,
Wide, and Frequent” are the first
to come along for a while. It's
good to know that kind of music
is still happening.

Hart has all the big-names from
Frisco on one cut or another, Gar-
cia, Weir, and Lesh, as usual, are
themselves, which is the best thing
that can be said for a musician.
The horn section, from Tower of
Power, are becoming the best added-
on brass men available for studio
jobs like this one. John Cippolina,
late of Quicksilver, sounds as good,
if not better, than he did way back
when on Happy Trails,

The other Bay-area luminaries
come off well for the most part.
Grace Slick’s vocal on “Blind John”
is her best since the Starship album.
It may be the last thing she record-
ed before she started losing her
voice. David Freiberg proves once
and for all, on “Fletcher Carnaby”
that he will never be a good vocalist.
Without a doubt, it’s the worst cut
on the album,

the heat rose to hellish levels of

Now that we had washed the clothes,
though, we had to go through
another ordeal: Drying the clothes.

After waiting 15 more minutes
for a dryer, we fed a dime into the
machine, and it began churning
away. We secured another machine
for the rest of the clothes. We wait-

the machines stopped. The clothes
were dry. Or were they? No, they
were still wet! We looked at each
other in grim silence. “Put two more
dimes in, boys,” I muttered through
clenched teeth, “It’s all we can do.”
Whimpering quietly we put in two
more dimes. And waited.

Finally, the thirty minutes was up!
So the clothes were finally dry,

Stop the World has been called
“a new type of musical.” “It’s not
a funny musical,” said Mrs, Barnes.
“It's about the modern everyman

Approximately 200 alumni will
return to the Washington and Lee
campus this weekend for W&L’s
annual Homecoming festivities.

A variety of activities for both
students and faculty alike have been
scheduled for the weekend.

The J. Geils Band will perform
in Doremus Gym Saturday night.
The band, which was the hit at-
traction at the Pocono Festival this
summer, features music which its
lead vocalist, Peter Wolf, describes
as “primitive Funk.”

Jody ROCK, said of
the J. Geils Band, “No desription
does full justice to what they've
accomplished: a unique synthesis of
the most powerful sounds of the
lasi 20 from R&B to high-
period rock and roll to Chicago
blues to Motown to Memphis to
mid-60's rock.”

The J. Geils Band
albums, “The J. Geils
“The Morning After.”

The concert will begin at 8 p.m.
Saturday. Dance Plan subscribers
and their dates will be admitted free
to the concert. Tickets will be five
dollars per person, Alumni couples
will be admitted for five dollars per
couple.

On Saturday afternoon, the Wash-
ington and Lee football Generals
will host Sewanee in a contest at
Wilson Field, beginning at 2 p.m.
A homecoming queen will be crown-
ed at halftime, and will be chosen
from candidates representing vari-
ous fraternities and other campus
organizations. In other weekend
sports activities, W&L will face VMI
Friday at 3 p.m. in a soccer match
on VMI's field.

Alumni are invited to participate
in a discussion Saturday beginning
at 11 am. in Lee Chapel on “The
University’s Future.” Participating
in the discussion will be President
Robert E. R. Huntley, the three
academic deans of the university,
Drs. William Watt and Edward At-
wood and Dean Roy Steinheimer
of the School of Law, Robert
Brennan, president of the EC, and
Dr. Sidney Coulling, chairman of
the faculty commitiee on alumni

Poetry Readings

Are Started As
Weekly Series

A new series of weekly poetry
reading has begun under the auspices
of Ariel, the student literary maga-
zine. They are scheduled to take
place every Thursday at 8 p.m. in
the library of the University Center
library.

According to senior Scott Rieger,
who heads up the program, anyone
interested in reading is invited to
participate, including W&L and VMI
students, faculty members, girls
from other schools, or townspeople.

“We're hoping the program will
become self-generating,” said Rieger,
We don't plan to be particularly
structured, and we want people to

feel free either to read their own
work of present poetry by some
other artist which they'd like to
share.”

Those who want to read are asked
to call either Rieger or Ariel editor
Bob Wilson at 463-5727 or to leave
a message in the Ariel mailbox in
Payne Hall.

The “Poems” series is part of a
projected expansion in artistic offer-
ings to be generated this year by
Ariel. Editor Bob Wilson is cur-
rently working on plans for a pro-
jected art sketchbook, a phonograph

record, and various exhibits and
lectures, to be produced by W&L
students and sponsored by Ariel.

“Our purpose is to provide as many
outlets as possible for students to
express their creative talents and
imaginations,” he said,

Wilson also announced that Eng-
lish professor Steve Goodwin and
recent graduate David Olson will
read from their novels in the WA&l
bookstore at & p.m. on November
9. The event had been postponed
from earlier in the yeat

OUTLOOK and REVIEW

October 25, 1972

Once And Future Rotc

Only God and maybe Richard Nixon know where Henry
Kissinger is at this moment, though, to be sure, he is some-
where busily taking all the wind out of George MeGovern’s
Presidential sails. The ubiquitous Mr. Kissinger, straight
from an absolutely stunning fold-out in this month’s National
Lampoon, was last heard fulminating over his frustrations
at the hands of Nguyen Van Thieu: “I have succeeded in
Peking, in Moscow, and in Paris—I’m certainly not going to be
stopped in Saigon.” True grit.

 

So, the name of the game is: preemption, And Senator Me-
Govern, the man who made his name by constantly reintro-
ducing the same anti-war amendment year after year (only to
have it shot down by Congressional anti-aircraft fire) has lost
his issue, He can no longer get anyone excited over Vietnam,

McGovern has, therefore, been preempted, i.e., had the rug
pulled out from under him, The draft is no longer a threat to
Our Best Young Men; except for a few sharp exchanges on
the amnesty issue, all’s quiet on the protest front.

Nevertheless, the remembrance of Cambodia and Kent
State seems all too vivid. It was but a mere two years ago
when we experienced our own campus conniptions. And with
this in mind, it seems so curious to note that, last week,

Washington and Lee decided to expand its ROTC program,

Now, in essence, the change is not all that alarming. The
faculty merely okayed a request from the military science de-
partment to allow any student from any other college or uni-
versity in the region that has no ROTC program of its own to
take courses here in military science.

Credits earned here would be transferred to the student's
“home college,” as under the Eight-College Exchange pro-
gram, and he would be eligible for the full range of benefits
concomitant with ROTC enrollment (allowances, scholar-
ships, ete.).

We don't see anything particularly wrong in inviting out-
siders to come join us in our soldiering. But it does strike us
as somewhat odd, when it seems that only yesterday ROTC
was the target of vilification all over the country and student
arsonists were razing ROTC buildings here, there and
everywhere.

But as Holmes said to Watson, “Now it’s all beginning to
make sense.” The tremendous nationwide army ad campaign
and the anxiety on the part of ROTC officials to expand their
rolls spells real trouble for ROTC,

One of the President's selling points, when fighting for
an all-volunteer force, was that intelligent, well-educated of-
ficers could be recruited through campus ROTC programs,
when lured by sufficient pay and benefits. But can they?

Most campuses who lost their ROTC unit in 1970 haven't
restored them ; those that still have them seem to be suffering
from dwindling interest. The irony of it is that, if indeed
ROTC is slowly dying, it is meeting, not a violent death at the
hands of activists, but a whimpering death at the hands of the
President's own policies,

N.E.P.

Campaign Spending

\ brief word of thanks is due the Executive Committee for
sparing us all from a barrage of those hideous campaign pos-
ters during the recent Freshman elections. We congratulate
the winners as well, and sincerely hope the class president and
vice-president find something to do during the coming year.

The EC managed to squelch effectively the widespread
use of such posters by imposing a strict spending limit on the
candidates, In a university our size, the need for this type of
political publicity has always been questionable, There most
certainly is never anything more unsightly than to have the
Apollonian serenity of our Colonnade obliterated by hundreds
of rainbow flyers,

Now, if only the same could be done for spending in the
current Presidential campaign. What if Poor Richard and Sir
George could be limited to only $8.50 each? Sheer bliss.

Films In Review

‘Macbeth’ Is Stark And Cruel

By JESS REEVES
Macheth
A Playboy Production
Directed by Roman Polanski

In the last few years the current
cinema has seen a wealth of Shake-
speare remakes, some of which could
easily give the playwright a bad
name. Scofield’s “King Lear” and
Williamson's “Hamlet” are, in turn,
unforgivably desolate and tiringly
gimmicky.

Roman Polanski’s “Macbeth” re-
marakably avoids both these pit-
falls and shows that an old classic
can be brought back to the screen
without being degraded. For those
who need to be convinced of this
fact the Lyric Cinema will present
Macbeth tonight and Thursday
night, October 25-26.

Although Macbeth played by
newcomer Jon Finch and his Lady
turn in acceptable and mechanical
performances respectively, the view-
er’s attention should be directed to-
ward Polanski’s treatment of the
play rather than the acting. The
setting is a barbarous, brutal Scot-
land in an age in which savagery
and harshness were the rule.

Polanski certainly makes the most
of this scene. Blood and gore abound
in gross quantities; the cruelty of
Macbeth’s Scotland is brought to
the screen in all its depravity. Mac-
beth slaughters the king's attendents
as one would slaughter a pig and
meets his end in being drawn and
quartered, The usurper’s head is then

Atlantic SD 7241

Having been exposed to The
Morning After a few months ago,
| approached this album by turn-
ing down the volume control before
actually listening to the record, It
doesn't make much of a difference,
though; these people are LOUD and
that’s the way you've gotta listen
to them. Like the Stones,

Well, they want to be like the
Stones, They've got just as much
raunch as any Jagger could, and
they whip up the audience on this
album enough to make me censure
speculation that if Doremus Gym
Was ever going to be blown out,
Saturday night is a likely time.

These people do have a
chance of becoming

Amerika’s

mounted on a pike and raised above
a cheering crowd,

Polanski’s weird sisters, in all their
grossness, have a hypnotic effect
upon Macbeth. The scene of his
return to the lair of the witches is
strange and frightening. He discov-
ers there a multitude of ancient

 

hags, stripped naked, sitting around a
fire in an underground chamber.
This macabre spectacle ends with
the cooing witches forcing a potion
on Maebeth which brings unconsei-
ousness and bizarre visions,
Polanski’s visual effects show
Macbeth's world as a sordid place

ang ‘Live’
answer to the Rolling Stones; they
just need a couple of more years
to build a mystique, Like the Stones,
their albums show little progession
of musical technique, They have a
style—loud and raunchy—and they
stick with it. Within this frame-
work, they are masters,

“Pack Fair and Square” is the
outstanding cut on the first side;
it's introduced on the album as
“Take out your False Tooth Baby
‘cause | want to suck on your Gum.”
and they'd probably do it, too.
“Serves you right to Suffer,” a John
Lee Hooker song, receives a rip-up
rendition on side 2. It's followed by
an unfortunately short “Cruisin’ for
a Love,” which has one of the best
boogie-style breaks I've heard,

If you like your rock loud and
hard, these are the kind of people
you want to listen to, They deliver.
Fven J. J, Matthews might like this
filisky,

out of which very little good could
possibly come. Landscapes are often
bleak wastelands where bright spring
days must be unheard-of,

The ghost at the banquet, far
from being an ephemeral shade of
the night, is all to realistic. At first,
appearing as Banquo looked before
his death, it is quickly transformed
into something half decayed, hav-
ing emerged from the earth, a vision
in which Poe would have revealed.
From this point in the film a once

depressing landscape becomes a
fantastic, horrible nightmare for
Macbeth.

All this may sound as though the
film is simply a study in the grotes-
que and that outside of this there

LETTERS TQ

The Sauna Situation

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

lt seems rather obvious, at this
time, that there never was much
wrong with the W&L sauna baths
and that their closing was nothing
more than an act of fraud by those
gentlemen, who are the ringmasters,
in that well-known side-show called
Doremus Gymnasium, The Ring-
tum Phi published an article con-
cerning the saunas last Thursday
and seven a.m, Tuesday morning,
the heat was flowing in saunas no,
2, 3, and 4 for the first time since
last May. Someone must have read
the article and told Coach Miller
about it,

There are a few changes that
you will notice if you happen to
wander down towards the sauna
facility, Sauna no. | has an out of
order sign on it (probably what
kept the saunas closed so far)—also,
there are copies of new rules for
sauna use posted everywhere you
might turn your head, These new
rules are quite interesting — the
saunas now close at 6 p.m, (11 p.m.
last year seven days a week). On
Saturdays they open at 9 a.m, and
close at noon (noon is the time
when the gym itself usually opens
on Saturday). On Sundays the saunas
are not open at all (the only day
you really need them).

What is the reason for these rule
changes? Why are the saunas open
less than 60 hours a week when
they were open 112 hours a week
last year? Why were the saunas
opened again when the repairs that
supposedly forced their closing are
still not completed?

| am left with only despair and
hope. Despair over the needless
overmunagement of our saunas and

is litthke of interest. Were it not
for the character of Macbeth this
would possibly be true. However,
by the time one witnesses his death
one realizes that the weak political
animal that is Macbeth has been
ensnared by forces he can neither
understand nor control. His consci-
ence and revulsion at his own deed
show that he is not insensitive,

As soldiers cheer while his corpse
is butchered one feels regret at the
death of a man who was entirely
human, realizing that his bloody
crown makes his death inevitable.
The film ends with another young
man being drawn to the lair of the
weird sisters. Thus Macbeth closes,
appropriately enough, not with a
bang but a whimper.

THE EDITOR

hope that this letter will evoke a
response that will free the saunas,

Rules For Laundering

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Mr. Darryl Carlton in the last
issue introduced us to one of the
greatest pleasures at WAL: “the
laundry run,”

To many of us, this ranks high on
the list alongside of “Roaatripping”
and “All-Nighters,”

Your first mistake, Mr. Carlton,
was that you attempted to do your
laundry at a decent hour, Rule No,
| of the College Students Laundry
Code states: No student shall be
seen doing his laundry between the
hours of 6 am, and 12 midnight,

Secondly, one does net use the
school laundry, More, importantly,
though, one does not even use a
laundry in Lexington,

Rule No, 2 states: No laundering
is to be done within a five-mile
radius of the student's domicile,

Now, you ask, where can | do
my laundry?

A favorite among many WA&L
students is the B-V Coin-Op Laun-
dromat on Magnolia Avenue, just
a short hop from Sem, At 2 a.m. it
offers al the washers and driers a
student could ever desire. There is
also a machine offering five differ-
ent kinds of detergent (all of which
are always available),

Okay, so much for your basic
laundry run. Now for Rule No, 3
Once you get the hang of it, don't
be afraid of making your own varia-
bons,

One tried and true method is to
arrange for a date at Mary Baldwin,
pick her up at 11:59 pm. and,

McGovern-Nixon: Final Battle A [pproaches

Democrats, and the accompany-

The Case
For McGovern

By BILL CUNNINGHAM

Contrary to what Mr. Mcllhaney
would have us believe, the Ameri-
can people really do have a choice
on November 7. The difference be-
tween the two presidential candidates
is like night and day,

and honesty. Manipulation, secrecy,
and deceitfulness have become such
an inherent part of the White House,
that it is littke wonder that obvious
corruption involved in the Water-
gate bugging affair has not alarmed
the people.

Until we have as President a man

Senator McGovern’s openness
and sincereity, we can no longer
expect our democratic process to be
taken with much respect. It is
essential for the sake of the country
that credibility be restored to the
White House.

Secondly, our next President
should have an humanitarian con-
cern for the domestic welfare of the
nation, President Nixon said in cam-
paigning in 1968, “I've always
thought this country could run. it-
self domestically, without a Presi-
dent... You need a President for
foreign policy.” It appears obvious

First and most important, our next
President must be a man of decency

“When my cup is empty I
resign myself to its emptiness;
but when it is half full I resent
its half-fulness.”

—Gibran

Look
where we're going.

We cover the South, touch base in the Midwest, and swin:

that this is one campaign pledge
President Nixon has kept!

Until we have as President a man
who has shown the boldness and
initiative that Senator McGovern
has on the domestic issues, i.e., tax
reform, farm problems, unemploy-
ment, etc., we can expect no real
solution in sight to the internal
problems which plague our country.

A third quality which our next
President should have is an instinct
for foreign policy—which comes,
not from experience or knowledge,
but from a “sense of the way the
world is moving.” It has been obvi-
ous in recent years that without
this instinct, a President tends to
become a tool of his military ad-
visors, who supposedly have a bet-
ter insight into foreign affairs.

In contrast to Presidents of re-
cent times, Senator McGovern has
been a public critic of U.S. invol-
ment in Viet Nam since 1963. Until
we have as President a man of
Senator McGovern’s foresight and
frankness in foreign policy, the
United States cannot expect its Chief
Executive to execute foreign policy

 

decisions with a true grasp of in-

ternational realities.

It’s due to these basic qualities of
frankness, sincerity, openness, initi-
ative, and, above all, of decency and
honesty, that George McGocern’s
election is a necessity.

The Case

For Nixon

By PHILIP SPIVEY

Why Nixon? This question never
fails to evoke passionate and em-
bittered responses from both left
and right-wing extremists in America
today. To the Left, the President is
a man of no sincerity who really
isn't interested in the plight of the
American people. To the Right, he
is a man without principle—a man
who has deserted his cause, Both
sides view him as a symbol of
bland mediocrity and shifty poli-
tics,

Yet the President is far ahead of

his Democratic opponent in the

polls, while his American Indepen-
dent opponent shows very little ap-
preciable strength at all. The polls
show more than just the fact that
Nixon is just a choice between three
candidates. They also demonstrate
the belief of most Americans that
he has done a good job as President.

How can this be? The radicals
and reactionaries find it totally il-
logical. Yet, in a sense, this failure
of the people to conform to their
ideas only confirms the extremists’
belief that masses are incapable of
understanding issues or recognizing
qualities of leadership in a candidate.

This elitist view of the American
voter is convenient when applied to
their rationalization that since Nixon
is so blatantly insincere and unprin-
cipled, Americans support him
either because they don't really
understand what George McGovern
or John Schmitz are offering them
or because they are simply too
stupid to realize that Nixon is their
natural enemy.

news media, it is inconceivable that
most Americans are unaware of the
positions and ideologies of McGov-

quire self-rightousness on a mam-
moth scale to accuse sixty million
Americans of blanket stupidity.
Why Nixon? The majority of
voters answer this question on the
basis of observation—not ignorance,
For the past four years, they have
watched the President and felt the
effects of his policies. They have
seen him make mistakes. They have
seen him reject those policies that
caused the mistakes. They have
noted his lack of charisma and have
had the perspicacity to know that

what the extremists call “bland
mediocrity” is really cool, practical
intelligence.

While the Left flails the President
for having allowed the Vietnam
War to continue, the majority of
voters in America are relieved that

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Blue Drops Ist

By TOM ANGELILLO
Washington and Lee’s
Country team was handed its first
defeat of the season this past Satur-
day by Bridgewater College, 22-33.
The loss to the perennially tough
Bridgewater club lowered the Har-
riers record to a fine 7-1.

Cross-

It was an extremely tough loss
for the Blue, as most of the runners
improved dramatically on their pre-
vious best times. As usual, Stu
Nibley finished first in the meet with
a fine time of 26:25 over the five
mile course. Having established a
new school record against Lynch-
burg in the beginning of the month,
Nibley is only 23 seconds away
from the course record.

Jim McMenamin and Mike Burns
finished fifth and eighth respectively,
while Bill Kalal and Tem Washing-
ton closed out W&L’s top five by
placing 9th and 10th.

The Generals next test will be
the VCAA state college meet, held
at Bridgewater's home course. This
meet figures to be a dual between
W&L and Bridgewater once again
for the top honors. Although it will
be tough running on the top op-
ponent’s home course, Coach Miller
feels that Bridgewater will not be
able to concentrate solely on W&L
runners and therefore might be able
to defeat Bridgewater in this return
match,

Success in this return meet will
depend on the Blue’s 2-5 men run-
ning closer to the leaders. Bridge-
water has only five good runners
and the Generals must give those
five a better race.

Psychologically, it may be easier
for the Generals to get “up” than
for Bridgewater.

Friday’s meet will be a big one,
not just because of the recent loss,
but because of the overall high
standard of competition.

 
   

Wahoos Sink Generals:
Water Polo Finishes 2nd

This weekend, Washington and
Lee travelled to Charlottesville for
their second State Water Polo Tour-
nament. In spite of their lack of
publicity, the Blue do have a Water
Polo team, and a very good one.

Led by sophomore captain Dick
Barber, the Blue swimmers went
into the contest as one of the fav-
orites. Starting for the Generals at
tipoff time were Dick Barber, Jim
Howard (Soph.), Alan Corwith (Sr.),
Steve Johnston (Soph.), Bill Tiers
(Fr.), Gary Seldemridge (Fr.), and
Bill Brotherton (Soph.).

WAL, due to their second place
finish last year, drew a bye in the
first round, In most tournaments
this would be a blessing, but in this
case it hurt the Generals in several
ways. First of all, the Blue had but
one game in which to warm up for
the championship. In the second
round, they polished off Virginia
Commonwealth University 28-5. The
game was never close, as the Blue
were obviously the superior team.
VCU, needless to say provided little
preparation for the finale.

WAL met the homestanding Wa-

 

RING-TUM PHI

hoos in the finals, It was a rematch
of last year, and proved to be a
very exciting one indeed. U.Va. won
it with a late, disputed goal by a
score of 8-7,

Dick Barber was the only Gen-
eral to make All-State, his second
year in a row, He was also named
the outstanding player of the Tour-
nament. One reason that W&L had
so few on the All-State squad was
that the judges who determined that
team saw less of the W&L players
than they did of the other teams
competing in the Tournament. U.Va.
put four men on the All-State team.

After Virginia and Washington
and Lee, VMI finished third, VCU
fourth, University of Richmond Sth,
and William and Mary 6th.

Water Polo, a new Olympic sport,
is not an intercollegiate sport. In
spite of this, Coach Stearns has man-
aged to come up with two consecu-
tive winners. Especially since this is
one of the least publicized, and least
understood sports on campus, much
credit must be given to Coach
Stearns, and especially to his swim-
mers for giving W&L one more win-
ning season,

By PAUL CAVALIERE

Wednesday, October 18th, the
Washington and Lee University
Soccer Team played Roanoke Col-
lege to a 2-2 tie. The soccer team
has been without the services of one
of its Tri-Captains, John Buckley,
since the Lynchburg game. John is,
unfortunately, out for the rest of
the season. During a_ pre-season
scrimmage against the University of
Virginia Buckley dislocated his
wrist which refractured a previous
injury. He was in a cast for three
weeks, but, during this time, he
came out to practice and even play-
ed for a short time in a game,

After the cast was taken off and
his wrist X-rayed, it was found that
the navicular bone was broken and
that he would have to have another
cast put on. Consequently, Captain
Buckley, as Coach Joe refers to
him, voluntarily quit the team, John
loves to play soccer but he thought
it would be best for the team and
himself if he quit. As usual grades
are always in the background, and
being a pre-med student, he needs
to spend a lot of time with the
books,

Back to the Roanoke game, Dur-
ing the first half Washington and
Lee played like it was the first day
of practice. The passes were poor,
there was no consistency, and no
anticipation. The field conditions
did not help matters either, It was a
rainy, foggy day and both the field
and the ball were very slippery.
Even though W&L was playing ter-
ribly Roanoke was not playing much
better. They did score with twelve

seconds left in the half,

There was silence at half time,
at the Blue end of the field any-
way and the second half began with
another Roanoke goal. From then
on it was the Generals ballgame.
The Blue kept constant pressure on
the Roanoke goal. Coach Lyles yell-
ed from the sidelines, “Anyone that
doesn’t hustle will sit their can on
the bench for the rest of the game.”
The tide had turned and the Gen-
erals finally had the upper hand,
After this constant pressure the
Roanoke goal was dented not once,
but twice, by the Generals. Both
scores were made by sophomore,
and chief hustler, John Embree.

The game went into overtime
and the result was the same as the
Indiana University game, a frustrat-
ing, heartbreaking tie. This tie did
hurt us and put the Generals virtu-
ally out of the race for the V.LS.A.
(Virginia Intercollegiate Soccer As-
sociation), now trailing Madison
College by a game and a half.

The whole season now boils down
to the Randolph-Macon game this
Wednesday, October 25. Randolph-
Macon is presently rated as the best
team in Virginia, even higher than
U.Va. If the Generals should some-
how knock off the Hornets, the Blue
will be able to go to a State tourna-
ment which pits the best two small
college teams against each other,

According to John Buckley the
season shapes up to be a fairly
good one. “The Generals should
have a 5-3-2 record,” said Captain
John,

Green Terrors Spook Generals

By BILL FLESHER

Washington and Lee’s Generals
saw Western Maryland’s version of
the Frick and Frack act—only the
names were Bricker and Brock-
meyer. The running of Joe Brock-
meyer and the leadership of quarter-
back Mike Bricker combined with
W&L mistakes added up to a 29-7
defeat for the Generals last Satur-
day.

If one had left after the first
quarter he’s have assumed the game
would have been fairly even. Period
number one saw both defenses stop
possible scoring drives. The Generals
drove from their own 20 to Western
Maryland’s 30, but the drive stalled
after a holding penalty, Western
Maryland's lone threat ended when
an Ode Haugan field goal attempt
fell short. The score after one
quarter was 0-0,

The Terrors got the first break
early in the second quarter. They
got the ball on their 48 after a
fine return of a Chappy Conrad
punt. Western Maryland, with
Bricker and Brockmeyer doing most
of the work, then drove fifty-two
yards in 13 plays, with Bricker scor-
ing from the one. Haugan’s kick

gave the Terrors a 7-0 lead with
6:50 left in the half,

Break number two occured five
plays after the enusing kickoff.
W&L’s Tom Van Amburgh fumbl-
ed, and Western Maryland recovered
on the Generals’ 25. They then
drove to the one-foot line, but were
unable to score. They settled for a
Haugan 20-yard field goal, which
gave Western Maryland a 10-0 lead.

Whatever Coach Buck Leslie said
at halftime had an immediate but
not long-lasting effect on the Gen-
erals. After receiving the second-
half kickoff W&L marched sixty-five
yards in 11 plays, with Tom Van
Amburgh going the last two for the
touchdown, The big play in the
drive was a 24 yard pass from Steve
Fluharty to Mark Lane which moved
the ball to the Western Maryland
four, Doug Chase added the point
after, and it was Western Mary-
land 10, W&L 7,

Those were to be all of W&L’s
points, however, as Western Mary-
land took over. A short punt by
Conrad gave Western Maryland the
ball on the Generals’ 31, Four plays
later, Brockmeyer crashed over
from the twelve for a touchdown.

The snap from center on the PAT
attempt was bad, the desperation
pass fell short, and the score was
16-7,

Two plays after the Western
Maryland kickoff, Fluharty had a
pass intercepted on the Generals’
39. Two plays after the pickoff,
Brockmeyer stormed 34 yards for
another score, breaking several
tackles on his way to the end zone.
Only 1:05 had elapsed since Brock-
meyer’s first score. Haugan added
the extra point, and the Generals
suddenly found themselves trailing
23-7.

Leslie then inserted Lewis Powell
at quarterback in an attempt to
get the offensive moving. But it just
wasn't the Generals’ day. Powell had
a pass intercepted early in the fourth
quarter, and the door was shut on
the Generals, Western Maryland
added another touchdown late in the
game on a pass from Bricker to
Mike Yurek, making the final score
Western Maryland 29, Washington
and Lee 7.

Looking back, now, at the first
five games, we see two different
teams have played wearing the same
jerseys. First there is the W&L

 

 

which played Westminster and
Towson State — crisp attack, good
execution, few mistakes, Then there
is the W&L team which played
Centre, Hampden-Sydney, and West-
ern Maryland emotionally down,
sloppy, lethargic. No one can ex-
plain this difference — is it the
pressure of school? The factor of
playing on the road? Fear of the
opponents? No one knows for sure.

 

This week is Homecoming, and
W&L takes on the University of the
South, better known as Sewanee.
Game time is 2:00.

CONTEST WINNERS!!
Steve Greene has won the foot-
ball contest and will receive first
prize of $5.00. The runner-up was

ball contest are Berry Long, $5.00,

The Case For Nixon
(Continued from page 3)

dent has succeeded in meeting our
potential enemies face-to-face and
that a third world war has never
been more remote.

While the Left attacks the Presi-
dent for ignoring the human needs
of poor Americans, the voters notice
that for the first time in twenty
years the government is spending
more on these needs than on de-
fense.

Why Nixon? Perhaps if for no
other reason, Americans support
the President because he has re-

duced the crisis atmosphere of the
60's and has allowed them to re-
gain a sense of control over society
and their own lives. The campaign
charges of corruption have not alt-
ered the fact that Richard Nixon
has restored the people's trust in the
presidency because, unlike the elit-
ists, he trusts the people and their
ability to understand the issues con-
fronting America.

Troilus and Cressida wind their way between the bars of the “jungle-jim” set designed for W&L’s production of
Shakespeare’s drama.

‘Troilus And Cressida’
Premieres Next Tuesday

On Tuesday night, November 7
the University Theatre will open
with a production of one of Shake-
speare’s most difficult plays, “Troi-
lus and Cressida.” Lee Kahn has di-
rected a predominately young cast,
and Ken Barnes has described an
innovative “jungle-jim” set.

Of course, this play has been
produced in other ways, and Dr.
G. W. Ray of the English depart-
ment provides a background story
on stage history below. Junior Bill
Austin treats the thematic aspects
on page 2.

Nixon Sweeps Student Poll

President Richard Nixon, capturing 53% of the 733 stu-

dent votes, won overwhelmingly in last Friday's mock elec-
tion, sponsored by the Ring-tum Phi and the Political Science
Club. George MeGovern polled 38% of the student vote. 8%,

either expressed no opinion or wrote in a candidate (eight

students voted for John Schmitz for President).

But, among the Washington and Lee faculty, the trend was

almost reversed, with MeGovern capturing 53% of the fac-
ulty votes. Nixon won 35% of the 106 faculty ballots.

In the student balloting,

the race for vice-president was

much closer than it was for president. Here, Vice-President

Spiro Agnew took 49% of the vote, while R.

‘

won out:

alliterative aptitude, “this hybrid

mounted Shakespeare's version at

and hundred-faced and hydra-head-}} the Great Queen Street Theatre in

ed prodigy at once defies and de-
rides all definitive comment.” Yet in
this complex mixture of comic, sa-
tiric, historic, romantic, tragic, and
epic matter Shakespeare, has used
his brilliant intellectual powers and
dramaturgic skills, to create inter-
locking ironic parallels and con-
trasts which ultimately test the many
verbalized abstractions of Love,
War, Value, Time, and Honor on
the bedrock battlefield of Reality.

Stage History

The toughest problems and pit-
falls, however, are faced not by
critics or scholars, but by those few
directors and companies courageous
(foolish?) enough to stage such a
demanding drama. This play about

heroes of yesteryear requires ap-
propriate heroic measures from
those who seek to enact it. For

openers, the would-be director con-
fronts a massive text of some 3300
lines; in the canon only Richard Hl
and Hamlet (written just prior to
Troilus) are longer. Besides sheer
Mass, there are problems of Energy.
Troilus is short on action and fast-
paced dialogue, but long on inertia
and self-consciously rhetorical and
interminable set speeches, taxing
enough for sophisticated actors. No
wonder actor-manager John Philip
Kemble never produced the play
though he did manage to cut and
cast it!

Thus it will come as no surprise
to learn that performances of Troi-
lus and Cressida have been extreme-
ly cut and conceived ones the rear-
est of all. The ensuing short stage
history of Troilus also suggests a
relationship between the increasing
frequency of Troilus performances
in modern time and the prolifera-
tion of Shakespeare festivals, uni-
versity theatres and various perman-
ent Shakespeare companies in Eng-
land, Canada, and America. The
sudden recent popularity of Troilus,
however, can only be attributed to
the timeliness and profound engage-
ment of its central themes.

During the Restoration, the great
age of Shakespeare's “improvers’”,
Troilus trod the boards in John
Dryden's infamous alteration, Troi-
lus and Cressida or Truth Found
Out Too Late (1679). This perver-
sion, replete with numerous addi-
tions do and abridgments of the ori-
ginal, is most notable for a Cressida
who remains faithful to Troilus
throughout. After the final Covent
Garden revival of Dryden's revision
in 1734, Troilus retired to the “clo-
1907 when Charles Fry

set” until

In a Curriculum Committee re-
port given by Dick Marsh, he said
his commitiee was looking into why
the teacher of a course has to know

Pass-Fail. Marsh said he was look-
ing into the possibility of all stu
dents being given marks and to have
them changed in the Registrar's of-
fice to Pass-Fail if need be.

London. Soon after, William Poel’s
Elizabethan Stage Society produced
an unusually pictorial, but severely-
cut Troilus. Poel’s characteristically
bare stage was draped with black
and purple curtains. Thersites, Aene-
as, and Paris were played by ac-
tresses, Poel himself played the sy-
philitic Pandarus, but the occasion
was memorable mainly for the elo-
quent wantonness of Edith Evans’
Cressida. In 1922 a vigorous ver-
sion done by the Marlowe Society
with an all-male cast (paying back
Poel?) initiated the custom of black-
clad Myrmidons who surround the
unarmed Hector like vampires.
The first of many “modern dress”
experiments was Michael MacOwen’s

when cormorant war” threatened.
The Trojans wore khaki, the Greeks
pale blue uniforms, Ulysses was a
diplomat with gold eyeglasses, Ther-
sites a bedraggled left-wing reporter,
and Pandarus a passe roue. Tyrone
Gutherie also essayed modern dress

in his uncut but otherwise icono-
clastic revival at the Old Vic in
1956. Audiences gazed upon the

antics of pre-World War I militar-
ists, the Trojan War translated into
a struggle between Ruritania and a
coalition of Central European
Powers. The frivolous Trojans, stage
historians tell us, were “resplendent
in yellow with plumed brass helmets
and heliograph-winking __ breast-
plates” whereas the factious Greeks,
given to much Nazi heel-clicking of
their jackboots, sported spiked hel-
mets and bristly mustaches. Cres-
sida wore a_ hobble-skirted riding
habit, Thersites was a seedy war
correspondent with sketchbook and
camera, and Helen seductively tickl-
ed the ivories of her grand piano,

rhersites, Eric Porter's Ulysses, and
Max Adrian's Pandarus. In the
strongly homosexualized 1968 Royal
Shakespeare production, however,
any earlier thematic imbalance is
more than redressed by Barton, now
the sole director. He gives us lechery
enough with such business as naked

OUTLOOK and REVIEW!
Election 72

There is one, final, rip-roaring week in this Presidential
campaign, and the suspense is simply killing us. President
Nixon attempts to fight off embarrassment launched from two

fronts—one from Hanoi, over the Halloween Peace Pact that
never got signed; the second from the media, with the Wash-
ington Post in the vanguard, concerning the espionage appar-
ently perpetrated by the someone in the White House.

Meanwhile, Senator McGovern criss-crosses the country,
lashing out... over Watergate, President Thieu, and Nixon’s
recent veto of a whole slate of social legislation,

Yet, outside of the candidates themselves, no one seems to
be particularly enthralled by this performance. This was to be
the first election in quite awhile where the differences on the
issues would be clear-cut; the choice, well-defined.

But while Nixon manages to cling to a commanding lead
over his opponent, his coattails seem surprisingly short—he
will, by every estimate, fail to pull enough Republican can-
didates with him to gain control of either House in Congress.

Faced with this picture of Election ‘72, the staff of the
Ring-tum Phi has decided not to lend our coveted endorse-
ment to either candidate, Our reasons are these: (a) we were
pretty much split down the middle, as to our individual Presi-
dential preferences, and (b) even if we did endorse someone,
who'd really care anyway?

We thought a much more constructive contribution would
be to conduct a poll to find out what Washington and Lee stu-
dents thought about the race. So, joining hands with our
friends in the Political Science Club, we set to work.

Unfortunately, our effort was somewhat sabotaged, not
by the Committee to Re-Elect the President, but by our own
errors. First, we neglected to put the American Party ticket
of Schmitz-Anderson on the ballot. We did this, not because
of any insidious motive to supress right-wing sentiments, but
rather to restrict our survey to a major party poll. Neverthe-
less, Schmitz and his running mate received several write-ins
and probably would have grabbed more votes had their names
been on the sheet.

Secondly, our question about amnesty for draft resisters
was admittedly unclear. We should have offered an alterna-
tive to a straight yes-or-no answer, e.g., “yes, if they agree to
two year's of public service.” Many people, again, penned in
their own qualifications for amnesty.

So the results, as printed on our front page this week,
show Mr. Nixon as the winner, 54% to 38% for McGovern,
The really interesting statistic was Sargent Shriver’s victory
over Spiro Agnew as the Vice-Presidential choice. And what
about the generally far-from-poor W&L students rating the
economy as Issue Number One?

\s we head into the final stretch, W&L students have,
rather astoundingly, chosen Nixon with almost the same
percentages now predicted by Messrs, Gallup and Harris for
November 7, We may have messed up the Mock Convention,
but this, folks, is the Big Time. Could it really be true after
all: as W&L goes, so goes the nation?

The University Council

We get the distinct impression that freshmen, and many
upperclassmen, really don't know what or who the Univer-
sity Council is. So here's a chance to find out.

The UC consists of 12 students and 12 faculty members,
alternately chaired by the student body president and the uni-
versity president. Its primary power lies in the administration
of student affairs. In other words, the University Council has
the last say on most non-academic questions,

It was in its function as social regulator that the Univer
sity Council two years ago passed the elimination of uniform
parietal hours in the dormitories and fraternities

Further, the group serves as a general forum and advisor
on policy matters. It provides the most amenable way for
faculty, administration, and students to exchange views on
the issues concerning the university as a whole,

Tonight the UC holds its November meeting, at 7:30 in
the EC room, On the agenda is one issue which sparked con
siderable response in these pages during the first weeks of

Shakespeare As Cynic

A Look At “Troilus and Cressida’

Play’s Themes

By BILL AUSTIN

A powerful dose of Shakespeare's
cynicism invades Lexington next
week with the presentation of Troi-
lus and Cressida by the University
Theatre. Set in the seventh year of
Troy’s ten-year siege, the work calls
upon humanity’s noble ones, its my-
thological heroes, to display woeful
inadequacy when faced with man-
hood’s primary tests of love and
war.

Troilus’ beloved Cressida betrays
him by lusting for another, evidence
of passion’s folly in creatures over-
stuffed with the hot juices of desire.
In a similar fashion, Hector’s fon-
dest love, honorable combat, lures
him to disaster with the treacherous
Achilles, man-child who pays no
such homage to virtue. These trag-
edies gain a certain element of

Letters
To the Editor

Are Saunas Important?

lo the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

The 1972 Presidential election is
nigh, right? An interesting commen-
tary on campus concern is last
week’s letter concerning the Dore-
mus bureaucracy’s nasty rulings on
sauna usage. Shall we write a letter
to our new president and ask him
what a purely democratic ruling
would be on such an issue?

Perhaps there are no more impor-
tant topics of conversation on the
hill than who is permitted to use the
saunas and when. Certainly there is
a wider-ranging principle involved.
However, it seems to me that a
senior might have better things to
think about. The issues at W&L
should be raised, but what, really,
are the issues?

Brian Richardson, °73

Only One Applicant
To the Editor of the Ring-tom Phi:

Some time ago the Executive
Committee announced the opening
of positions for freshmen on the
four standing subcommittees of the
EC, Along with Dennis Michaud, |
am co-chairman of the University
Center Committee, and we were
somewhat dismayed and disappoint-
ed by the level of response we got—
there was one freshman who applied.

At one time W&L was proud of
its concept of student government—
students actually decided many
major policy decisions. If such pride
exists, where is it? If such students
exist, where are they? You tell me.

Our committee has planned and
carried out many ideas—some new
and some old—ranging from Sweet-
briar mixers to happy hours to art
exhibits The list goes on and on.
We have a substantial budget from
which to draw, and we seek stu-
dents, like ourselves, who would
like to be an integral part in trying
to turn W&L into a more cohesive
and united community.

li’s not that hard to do, If you
are interested in helping us—and
this plea is not limited to freshmen
but to any student—please contact
either myself or Dennis or Ken
Lane, the University Center director.

comedy’s relief in the deformed per-
sonage of Thersites, garrulous Greek
whose scathing remarks expose the
entire affair as mere bickering over
a cuckold and whore,

In effect, Shakespeare takes a
world of the idealized past and ex-
poses it for its true nature. Men
who speak of acting with the wisdom
of reason cavort in the wasteland of
foolish sensuality. Rhetoric flows
without limit or scruple as the gods’
favorites scramble for personal ful-
fillment, oblivious to finer impulses,

Before Shakespeare's perceptive

eye, mighty Achilles proves to be
cowardly and selfish. Hector, Troy’s
champion, meets death as a slaugh-

 

tered animal. Helen and Cressida,
women of great physical beauty,
emerge morally repulsive as infidel-
ity’s pawns,

Even Troilus, the wronged lover
whose heart demands bloody re-
venge, is little more than an infatu-
ated romantic with a core of lust.
Passion rules his eyes, as it does all
whose supposed idealism finds its
base in vengeance and violence.

Shakespeare's view is a particular-
ly disturbing one, for in the play’s
final moments, it focuses on the cele-
bration of wanton destruction, Rea-
son's sole voice appears in the rav-
ings of mad Cassandra and is not
heeded. Men will die, and Troy will

fall before Greek deception, all for
an honor which does not exist out-
side the wagging tongues of the de-
bacles’ fools.

The tone of the work gains much
strength in the abundance of eating
imagery. This world is populated by
animals of gross appetites, beings
that sacrifice their glimpse of the
heavens for the lure of physical sat-
isfaction.

Shakespeare expects no saints on
a globe that holds little room for
the noble, the vulnerable. Yet he
despairs over the decline of love's
truth, and debases the glorification
of war, Indeed, “we go wrong, we

go wrong.” (V, i.)

Troilus and Cressida, rich in dia-
logue and, therefore, difficult to
grasp and judge quickly, presents an
intriguing challenge for both the pre-
senter and the audience, Sources
close to the heart of this univer-
sity’s production speak of a novel
approach to the work which will
hopefully accentuate the fine sub-
tlety of the language while updating
its impact.

Certainly, the play deserves at-
tention, Sadly enough, its themes are

timeless, and the artistic force which

iHuminated it is well worth thought-
ful observance. View the spectacle

We have had several letters

and comments directed to us
concerning a paragraph in last
week's EC article. It stated: “A
laundry service for students is
being set up by Archer Frierson
and Mike Brittin to enable stu-
dents to have their gym uniforms
washed three times weekly at a
cost of one dollar per week, The
plan will go into effect in Janu-
ary but the EC urged students to
sign up now.” This was taken by
many students as a solicitation
by the members of the EC for a
profit-making venture,

This is not the case at all and
we apologize to Brittin and Frier-
son for the misleading nature of
the article. The laundry is in-
tended purely as a non-profit
service for students run by the
Doremus Gym crew; no EC
member or any other student
will receive any benefit from the
enterprise,

 

 

 

Bands Highlight Weekend

By W. PATRICK HINELY

It's not often that there are two
consecutive nights of good live
music here in beautiful Lexington.
The past weekend was a pleasant
exception,

Friday night, a Lexington-based
band, “Home,” played in the Cock-
pit, which | was told was standing
room only at one point, And, of
course, the price was right.

The members of “Home” are the
only local residents I've met who
are primarily interested in the music
they're making as well as the money.
(We've all gotta eat.) “Home” will
make it big one of these days; they
play well, and most important, they
play together Especially on their
own numbers, and they've written

 

some nice ones, the sum is greater
than its constituent parts “Now I’m
Free,” one of their originals, is so
far superior to the trash played on
commercial radio that I laugh when
I listen to WLLL these days.

At the same time “Home” was
working it out in the Cockpit, two
acoustic musicians were doing some
stuff out at Buffalo Creek Restaur-
ant, a place well-suited to this kind
of entertainment. It's not the Cellar
Door or anything like that—yet. It
will be. Small clubs are nice.

Bill Haymes and Steve Askins
were the musicians; Haymes plays
guitar and piano, Askins plays gui-
tar and mandolin. They're from the
Baltimore area; Askins is “house
musician” at the Fifteen Beloved in

The J, Geils Band “raunch” in Doremus, Picture by Robinson,

Timonium,

They have a versatility most per-
formers don't, at least around here,
in that they can play together ot
individually and sound good either
way,

Haymes played a nice medley of
Beatles songs on the piano, with
some very smooth bridging. He's
easy-going when he plays, and there
Was & Nice rapport established with
the audience very quickly. He and
Askins did a superb set of Dylan
songs on Saturday night, including
a really fine rendition of “You Ain't
Goin’ Nowhere,” the best version
I've heard since the Byrds did it on
Sweetheart of the Radio. They fol-
lowed it with another song which
also happens to be on the Redeo al-
bum, “I am a Pilgrim,” in which
Askins strummed his mandolin as
well as Chris Hillman ever has, and
that’s pretty good,

Blue Gridders Score Quickly,
Hold On For Homecoming Win

By LEWIS HIXSON

An emotionally high General
team jumped into an early 21 to 0
first quarter lead, and then coasted
the rest of the way to upend Se-
wanee in last Saturday’s homecom-
ing game. They used the one-two
punch of Tom Van Ambungh and
Jim Farrar in a devastating first half
ground game which almost blew
the opponents out of the stadium.

The offensive line was splendid as
they opened holes that you could
have driven trucks through, With
this type of blocking, Van Am-
burgh and Farrar had no problem
picking up as much as 10 to 20
yards a shot during the first half.

The Generals scored the first
three times they touched the ball.
Their first came following the open-
ing kickoff with a 70 yard drive that
consumed 9 plays. The score came
when Van Amburgh broke into the
open after a quick hitter off left
tackle for 20 yards and the touch-
down. Chase made the point after
good and the Blue had jumped into
an early 7-0 lead.

Unable to move, Sewanee was
forced to punt to the Generals, who
set up shop at their own 33, This
time, it was almost a total replay
of the first series. Fluharty drove
the team 67 yards completely on
the ground. Once again, the drive
took nine plays. Once again, Van
Amburgh hit the left side of the
line, and went in from the 25,
Chase’s PAT was good, and the
scoreboard showed a 14 point Blue
lead,

However, there were still six
minutes left in the quarter and the
Generals were to make the most of
them. On the second play from

scrimmage, Perry Sowell stepped in
front of a Tipps pass and made
the interception at the Sewanee
41 yard line.

Once again, it took nine plays to
get into the end zone. The touch-
down came on a 7 yard blast up
the middle by Jim Farrar. Chase
once aagin converted to make it 21
to 0 at the end of the first quarter.
In the second quarter both teams
exchanged touchdowns. The Gen-
erals’ came on a 12 yard pass from
Fluharty to Mark Lane, and Se-
wanee’s on a 58 yard pass from
Tipps to Watson, Both teams made
their conversions good, and the half-
time score was W&L 28, Sewanee
7

The Generals’ performance in the
first half was by no means an in-
dication of how they were to do in
the second half. Sewanee stormed
back on the passing of Tipps. That
was accompanied by a_ noticable
W&L letdown, which made a game
of it. Had it not been for a brilliant
run by Jim Farrar of 56 yards in
the third quarter for a T.D., it
would have been too cose for com-
fort. Sewanee scored three times in
the second half, but failed to con-
vert on any of their conversions,
Tipps threw for one and ran for
one, as he grabbed the momentum
for his own team, The other Se-
wanee score came on a I yard
plunge by Sims,

To really see just how close the
game ended, one must look at two
things. First of all, Sewanee failed
to convert on any of their extra
points during the second half. Also,
in the last drive of the game, they
reached the General 3 yard line,
before Tipps fumbled and Bill Wal-

lace recovered for the Blue.

In looking back over the season,
one must wonder at the consistency
of the Blue. This game seemed very
simlar to the way they’ve played the
whole season, Like in the first half,
the Blue looked unbeatable as they
did against Westminster and Tow-
son State. Then again, the second
half is representative of their games
against Centre and Western Mary-
land, in which emotional letdowns
occurred,

Van Amburgh and Farrar both
had excellent games as they rushed
for 187 and 140 yards respectvely,
with two touchdowns apiece, Conrad
punted for a 45.8 yard average and
kept Sewanee out of good field posi-
tion,

Aside from individual standouts,
the defense played a very sound
football game in the first half, but
seemed to lack enthusiasm during
the second half. Next week the Blue
have an important conference game
with Southwestern in Memphis, and
will need all the consistency they
can get.

Booters Slip By Randolph-Macon, 3-2,
Kick VMI 9-1; Hope For Tourney Bid

By PAUL CAVALIERE
AND RICH KOCH

This past week was a most re-
warding one for the Washington and
Lee soccer team, which edged Ran-
dolph-Macon 3-2 and stomped VMI
9-1. The victory over Randolph-
Macon was especially satisfying to
the Blue, for the Hornets were rank-
ed second in the state behind Madi-
son College.

Having anxiously awaited this
chance to play Randolph-Macon,
the Generals were really psyched
by gametime, and jumped out to a
two goal lead in the first half. W&L
captain Meade Kampfmueller al-
lied the first score on a fine shot
from directly in front of the Hor-
net goal. With just seconds remain-
ing in the half, right-inside Jim Fox
scored with an assist by right-wing
Mike Schaeffer.

In the second half it appeared
that the soccer jinx had come once
again to haunt the Generals, This
contest marked the third time al-
ready in the 1972 soccer season that
Washington and Lee had registered
a two goal lead, only to see the op-
posing team tie the game. The sec-
ond half surge by Randolph-Macon
sent the game into overtime.

With thirty seconds left in the
first of two required overtime per-
iods, W&L’s Mike Schaeffer blasted
the deciding shot into the Hornet
net. The Blue wasted the second
five minute period in a kicking duel
with the frustrated Hornet squad.

The team virtually exploded with
happiness at game's end. A very
proud Coach Lyles termed the vic-
tory “the best team effort I have
seen in my entire fourteen years at
Washington and Lee.” The 110%
Award, normally given to outstand-
ing individuals after a game, was
conferred on the entire team, for the
exceptional group effort it displayed.

In W&L’s version of the Virginia
Campaign, the next battle was with
VMI, and when the rout was com-
plete, the Keydets left the field
thinking New Market was a picnic
when compared with this encounter
with the Washington and Lee Blue.
The Generals wasted no time. Jun-
ior Bill Spofford was the big gun,
scoring two of his three goals early
in the first half. Schaeffer added an-
other before VMI made their charge.
The rally was repulsed after the
Keydets had gained but one score,
and Kampfmueller sealed VMI's

fate with another goal shortly be-
fore the period ended,

Jim Fox opened the scoring bar-
rage in the second half with two
very quick goals. After that, with
the score at 6-1, Coach Lyles un-
loaded the bench, with everyone
getting a chance to play. For near-
ly twenty-five minutes the Blue sub-
stitutes skirmished with the Keydets,
until the varsity re-entered the game
with ten minutes remaining. Again
the Generals seized the initiative.
Spofford, Kampfmueller, and Chip
Tompkins each collected goals be-
fore the match ended. After the
game, Coach Lyles presented the
110% Award to Bill Spofford, who
did an outstanding job tending the
VMI goal.

The Generals are now ranked
fifth in the East Coast circuit of
the NCAA College Division stand-
ings. To qualify for the NCAA tour-
nament, W&L must move up to the
fourth spot or better. The Blue get
a chance to improve their position
on November 4th as they take on
nationally-ranked Navy. Hopefully
the Generals will not let the Mid-
shipmen stand between them and a
coveted berth in the NCAA tourna-
ment.

At any rate, J. Geils and his band
have a reputation for rocking, and
they do. To pick out particular songs
and talk about them in this case
would be silly, because everything
they play is equally explosive.

Their repertoire, like their style,
is somewhat limited from a musical
standpoint, but they have never
claimed to be anything more than a
shitkicking rock'n'roll band. They
haev full right to make that claim.
J. Geils and his work on that guitar
left litthke doubt as to his source of
inspiration,

Magic Dick, the harmonica play-
er, is an equally insane maniac with
perma-durable lips. Peter Wolf, the

modern dress as the War Between
the States rather than city-states, At
least these Myrmidons appeared in
Union suits! The 1963 Stratford
(Ontario) rendition effectively con-
trasted the two camps through cos-
tume: the more warlike Greeks were
clad in sombre grays and browns
whereas the sybaritic Trojans don-
ned “salacioussly-cut tunics of hot
orange and white in feminine
pleats.” Finally, in 1965, Joseph

KL CAUT UY,

 

Vol. LXXII

By PAUL LANCASTER

Iwo EC law representatives have
set up a committee through the
Executive Committee to investigate
the feasibility and possibility of
establishing two separate administra-
tion systems involving the Honor
System, one within the undergradu-
ate school and one within the Law
School.

[he proposal to set up these
separate administrations systems was
presented to the EC in their regular
Monday night meeting by Law
School Representatives Jeff Twardy
and Henry Jernigan. Twardy said
at the meeting that, according to a
poll taken by the two students, “the
Law School is overwhelmingly in
favor of some kind of autonomy
from the undergraduate school,” at
least in regards to the Honor Sys-
tem.

I'wardy stated that the desire for
this autonomy is felt by all three
classes in the graduate school. He
said, “the law school student body
does not wish to affiliate itself with
the undergraduate school as it now
stands,”

The move by Twardy and Jerni-
gan to ask the EC for a comprehen-
sive study of the situation may be
indicative of growing Law School
sentiment for a complete split from
the undergraduate school. A com-
plete break between the two major
divisions of the university, at least
in the respect of student govern-
ment, might be a move which
would correspond to the transfer
of the Law School students from
lucker Hall to Lewis Hall when the
latter is ready for use.

Ihe committee to study the prob-
lem will consist of eight members.
lwardy and Jernigan will chair the
group, Other members will include
two senior EC members, two under-
class Law School students, and two
underclass of the undergraduate
school. The committee will issue a
report later in the year with sev-
eral recommendations and proced-
ures, basing these on interviews
with members of the student body,
faculty, and administration. Any
conclusions drawn by the commit-

ice recommending a change in the

present administrative system of the
Honor System will then be brought
before the EC for consideration,

One proposal mentioned by
Pwardy and Jarnigan in their pre-
sentation to the EC was the estab-
lishment of a “Hearing Panel” in
the Law School for matters regard-
ing the Honor System. The panel
would consist of five members: two
EC law. representatives, and the
president, vice-president, and sec-
retary of the Law School student
body. Twardy warned, though, that
this proposal for such a hearing
panel was only a suggestion.

The poll, according to Twardy

Law School Proposes
Separate Honor System

and Jernigan, asked for a definite
stand by the law students whether
they were for or against the exist-
ing structure of administering the
Honor System. The two students
said that the student body respond-
ed overwhelmingly against the pre-
sent system.

Jernigan said that most law stu
dents “are unsure as to their posi-
tion regarding the Honor System.”
He stated that “the present system
poses some threats or ambiguity
towards law school students.” The
first-year law student also indicated
that law student sentiment was “not
so much a feeling of alienation as
it is of apprehension,”

T'wardy emphasized that the pro-
posals called for a change in the
administration of the Honor System,
not in the Honor System itself, He

said, “it may be just a big ego
trip, but they (the law’ students)
want to govern themselves. The

undergraduates are not peers of the
law students.”

Twardy and Jernigan also men-
tioned in their proposals the pos-
sibility of altering the present, new-
ly-initiated method of Honor trials,
They offered as possible changes the
introduction of a more active
counseling role in both the EC hear-
ing and the public trial, and the
liberalization of the jury selection
method which, the two Law School
representatives said, “at present is
almost inequitable.”

The two felt that, by the present
method of selecting a jury from 15

the University Council last Wednes-

Although the UC did not resolve
the question with any particular

lively and a subcommittee was form
ed to investigate what action
should be taken regard to
drama, art, and music at W&l

The topic was formally proposed
for discussion at the request of UC

Huntley also said that the new

have new facilities for music class-

As to a new theatre, Huntley said
that there were no present plans to
add one; but, he emphasized, the
$56 million figure is a “minimum”
one to bear the projected endow

theatre could possibly be considered
for expansion beyond that phase,

Parents’ Weekend Begins

Approximately 1200 parents and
other relatives of students will in-
vade the Washington and Lee cam-
pus this weekend for the 18th an-
nual Parents’ Weekend.

Planned activities for the upcom-

The weekend will kick off Friday
afternoon with several activities be-

bleached trellis, a ghastly, glowing
skeleton, a jungle gym upon which
the performers swing and _ slither,
scrambling like monkeys to in-
creased elevation, but not to higher

is wrapped in this chameleon-con-
duit, which becomes a battleground
and a boudoir, a jail for fuming
Ajax, a tunnel of escape for rant-
ing Thersites. The set is worked
to excellent effect. It is a practical
necessity, for without its outlet for
motion, the diffuseness of the dia-
would stand speakers in
perilous stillness. The gridmatrix is
also a foundation of theme. Brittle

When queried as to how such a colossal failure could have
been perpetrated in the first place, one Christ’s College tutor
could only say: we didn't watch our architects close enough.

Well, if this can happen in Cambridge, England, it can
also happen in Lexington, Virginia. Washington and Lee
has proudly launched one of the most ambitious building
programs in its history. Not only is new housing for under-
graduates and married students in the works, but also a new
law center and a new library are scheduled to appear under
the ten-year program. Those men in the administration re-
sponsible for this planning are faced with a truly unenviable
task; that of providing buildings which are not only practically
suitable but aesthetically suitable as well.

Looking back on our campus’ growth, we have to admit
that their administrative predecessors, by and large, botched
it. John Jordan, the architect of the original collonade build-
ings, obviously had a good thing going with his design of
colonial grace and serenity.

So, everything post-Jordan turned out to be some varia-
tion on a theme of red brick and white columns. Just
the turn of the century, Reid Hall was constructed
Victorian version, bigger than a breadbox but hardly more
attractive. The Science buildings followed suit, until we
attained Mock Collonade at its very worst, duPont Hall.

So there is reason to worry just a little as to what these

Preparation for law shoal site is now ‘ts progress.

&L Expands Into The Future

By JESS REEVES

Washington and Lee is becoming
an institution in the front ranks of
progress—as of last February, that
is. At that time President Huntley
announced that the school would
seek $56 million to launch a deve-
lopment program which will change
the face of the school. Buildings
will be thrown up like tepees in the
next few years, and they could turn
out to be as aesthetically pleasing
as the VMI barracks,

Law School

Among the structures to be erect-
ed are a new law school, (Lewis
Hall), a new undergraduate library,
and a little student housing here
and there.

If plans for the Lewis Hall are
any indication one could say that
buildings will be popping up around
here like weeds, rather than flowers.
It belongs to some time beyond
2001,

But the alumni magazine's special
report last May states that the new
building will be a “compatible archi-
tectural expression.” One should ask,
“compatible with what?” The archi-
tects probably had a city on Mars
in mind. The firm responsible for
Lewis Hall is Marcellus Wright,
Cox and Cilimberg of Richmond.
Perhaps a comparison between
Washington College and the new
law school is to be found in that
both contain bricks of some kind,
although the latter is mainly sand-
blasted concrete.

This monster should be functional
on the inside; that is the least one
expects from a seven-million dollar
building. It will house five major
classrooms, a moot court, and a
large library containing three times
as many volumes as the Tucker Hall
library. There will also be space
for 350 carrels, faculty offices, a
faculty library, and student activi-
ties’ rooms. The main level will en-
joy concrete panel ceilings with
much plaster, glass, and brick sub-
stituting for walls. This superstruc-
ture will enclose two courtyards in
which one would expect to find
concrete flowers.

The nine million dollar gift of
Sidney and Frances Lewis of Rich-
mond is more than generous and
is deeply appreciated by the school.
The new facility will allow the law
school to expand to 350 students.
The space Lewis Hail will provide
has been desperately needed since
Tucker Hall outgrew the 76 person
capacily it was built for in 1936,

if this building is to provide the
quantity of space needed perhaps
the education received there will
supply the quality the architects left
out, Let us hope that landscape
architects Griswold, Winter and

Swain of Pittsburgh will add many
trees and schrubs to hide the facade
from view.

The building program also in-
housing for undergraduate

cludes

 

Foreign Study Meeting

There will be a meeting of all
students interested in study abroad
on Thursday, November 9 at 7 p.m.
in University Center Room 114, This
will include those students who
either want to go on WAL’'s own
six-week program or wish to spend
a term of year as a participant in
another institution's program.

The meeting will be sponsored by
the Washington and Lee Foreign
Study Committee. After general in-
formation session, leaders of the
1973 six-week programs in France,
Germany, and Spain will talk with
students specifically interested in
those programs.

students. The project's proposed
budget is one million dollars, At
one point this domicile was to take
the form of modular student apart-
ments, a la Habitat, Concrete cubes
(the rooms) would have been built
in factories, moved to the site and
assembled like a child’s building
blocks, This would be a quick, easy
process, but as bizarre-looking as
it is conceivable. Fortunately, the
“Habitat of Woods Creek Valley”

scheme fell through when the Char-
lottesville company to supply the
modular units declared bankruptcy.

Student Housing Projects

Plans for this project are still
being drawn up. The structures are
planned to provide forty student
apartments, 24 with four bedrooms,
the remainder in three bedroom
units. Each will contain a kitche-
nette and living room for the three
to six occupants of each apartment.
This facility is expected to provide
168 students with living quarters,
designed to meet student needs and
preferences.

While giving undergraduates an
alternative to substandard local liv-

ing conditions the university also
feels compelled to clean up its own
backyard. Apartments are to be
built for married students to replace
the Hillside Terrace ghetto. Thirty
apartments divided among five build-
ings will be erected near the Liberty
Hall ruins. The cost of the under-
taking is estimated at $500,000 with
HUD lending funds on a debt-service
grant,

In contrast to some of the pro-

approximately five million to build
and equip. It will be 130,000 square
feet or four times as large as
McCormick.

A new library is unquestionably
needed but its location, where Wash-
ington Annex I now stands, could
present problems. If the administra-
tion’s taste in architecture is indi-
cated by plans for Lewis Hall a
monstrosity equal to the new law
school will be directly behind the

 

posed new buildings of Washington
and Lee, these should not be too
much of an eyesore. The only un-
fortunate aspect of the project will
be the cost of the rental units. Hill-
side Terrace saves the pockethbaak
of married students by offering
living quarters at $50 a month, but
the new apartments should rent for
at least $110-120 monthly,

Undergraduate Library

McCormick Library is fated for
a change of function and a face-
lift. A new undergraduate library
will be built behind Washington
Hall while McCormick is remodeled
to house the School of Commerce.
The undergraduate library will cost

Colonnade.

Perhaps it will not be over ten
stories high and thus not visible
rising above the Colonnade as one
approaches Washington Hall. One
can not be sure until the plans come
off the drawing board. Even if the
architects try to make it comple-
mentary to Washington College
problems will arise as the library's
floor space will be greater than that
of all Colonnade buildings com-
bined,

DISCussions

Santana's Newest

By W. PATRICK HINELY
CARAVANSERAI
Santana
Columbia KC 31610

Every Autumn since I’ve been at
this school I have watched the leaves
turn and fall, enjoying it with a
bit of solicitude about the coming
Winter, which always seems cold
and endless.

Besides knowing for sure that
Spring will be happening, one of the
things that make it all worthwhile
is a new Santana album every Fall.

When I was a freshman, one of
my beer-guzzling frat brothers in-
vited me over one day to party
with him. We downed a few and
he put Santana (Columbia CS 9781)
on the stereo and sat three playing
along with the congas on his Nor-
ton Anthology of English Literature,
That didn’t get me off, but the
album did; I bought one

At the beginning of my Sopho-
more year, | walked into the Band
Box (remember the Band Box?) and
saw Abraxas (Columbia KC 30130)
in the new albums rack. Within 30
seconds, | was running back to
my room to listen to the copy tuck-
ed securely under my arm. This
was followed by a similar occurrence
early in my junior year with San-
tana 3 (Columbia KC 30595). In-
evitable.

So when | walked into the base-
ment of the Co-op on November
1 and saw Caravanserai, it didn’t
take long to decide whether or not
to buy the album. And I’m glad I
did,

After all those rumors: Santana
broke up, he fired his band, they
left the country, they’re all in the
hospital, and all the dejected sour
grapes—‘“gee, that’s too bad, but
they couldn't have gotten much bet-
ter anyway,” and so on, HA!

The first album was a good
rocker; the second album was a
beautiful good rocker. The third
album was an energetic beautiful
good rocker. So now we come to
Caravanserai. The only label | can

yee) i.

put on it is a progressive cnergetic
beautiful good rocker,

That puts it closer to Jazz, But
that’s where Rock music is headed
these days, It’s not a bad place to
be.

There are some new _ influences
present: Pharoah Sanders, Leon
Thomas, Weather Report, the Ma-
havishnu Orchestra, If there is one
element added to this album which
was not in the previous ones, it
is spaciness. Perhaps  sparseness
would be a better term, though it
isn’t anywhere near as sparse as
something like “Dark Star” from
Live Dead.

In the earlier albums, though,
most everyone was cranking away
at a constantly full speed, while in

Booters Meet VPI
After Loss To Navy

CAVALIERE and the Generals needed a win to
make the national tourney. At the
outset, the game seemed to shape
up as an even encounter. The Mid-
shipmen were the first to score, but
WAL stormed right back on a goal
by Brandon Herbert. The 1-1 score
was a close as the Generals were to
get, as the Middies added another
goal before the half to take the lead,
and iced the cake with one more

The Tiger contest was played at
Death Valley on what could be

and sandy, It was built on an in-

TAR ty

  

By JIMMY BAIRD
and RICH KOCH

Outstanding performances last
year in basketball, track, and cross-
country resulted in Stu Nibley being
named Freshman Athlete of the
Year. Hopes for a repeat showing
as a sophomore ended, however,
when Stu decided to forego the
glamourous sport of basketball for
relatively obscure cross-country,

Why he did it is difficult to
answer. Stu realized that it would
be impossible to achieve excellence
by dividing his time between two
sports, but which should he enter
fulltime? Stu admits that most of
the pressure on him was directed to
choosing basketball, and even though
the decision was a tough one to
make, he knew that running was
what he wanted to do,

So far Stu has proceeded to
demonstrate that the decision was
the correct one. Second place in the
state cross-country meet, and most
recently, first in the CAC meet,
show that this dedicated runner is
anything but ordinary.

Nibley possesses two keys with
which he has unlocked the door to
his current success: self-discipline
and proper training. He commented,
“Most people do not have the dis-
cipline to work at the solitary sport
of running.” Stu himself runs year-
round, averaging seventeen miles
per day. He abstains from drinking
and smoking, and maintains a special
diet.

In addition, he sets aside almost
nine hours every night as required
sleeping time, claiming that “the
proper amount of rest is the most
important part of running.” Adher-
ing to such rigorous self-imposed
rules would seem to be all work

 

| ‘Stu Nibley: Sees Long
| Road To Success Ahead

 

and no play, but Stu loves to run,
and furthermore, he wants to be
good at it.

Besides running cross-country in
the fall, Nibley plans to participate
in the intercollegiate track program
in the spring. Although he likes the
variation of scenery and course pat-
terns characteristic of cross-country,
Stu. prefers track, because “it is
more psychologically demanding.”

He favors the pressure of close,
visible competition and the atmo-
sphere of excitment generated by
an onlooking crowd in a_ meet.
“However, in just day-to-day prac-
tice, track is boring and tedious,”
he says.

A  cross-counutry runner has
plenty of time to think as he jogs
through the counrtyside every day.
It is not unusual, therefore, when
a runner like Stu Nibley turns his
thoughts to the future, He thinks of
beating the best runners in the
schools Washington and Lee com-
petes against, He thinks of cutting
seconds off his time and going to
the NCAA college meet, and per-
haps to the Penn State Relays.

But ultimately his thoughts go
further. A cross-country runner
normally does not reach his peak
until he is twenty-five years old, It
is not unlikely that the Olympics
looms somewhere in his mind,

Right now Stu’s two-mile time of
9:20.0 is only one minute off
world class, but according to Nib-
ley, he is only a beginner at the
sport, Even so, that minute will only
come down slowly. What is to hap-
pen in the next few years is any-
one’s guess, but if Stu’s enthusiasm
and dedication continue, Washing-
ton and Lee cross-country will never
be the same.

“Most panning don't have the discipline to wah at aii sport of run-

ning.” But Stu Nibley has shown both the self-discipline and the dedica-
tion to earn a very bright future in the field of cross-country.

See-saw Football Fight
Finds Generals Behind

By LEWIS HIXSON

Last Saturday saw the Generals
once again show the kind of see-
saw season they're having as they
dropped a 14 to 0 decision to South-
western, Once again the Generals
found it hard to get up for a game
following a big victory the previous
week. Both teams showed a strong
defense throughout the game as both
scores by Southwestern did not come
from any offensive output,

In the first half the Generals
moved the ball fairly well behind
the balanced running attack of Tom
Van Amburgh and Jim Farrar, This
combination drove the Blue inside
the Lynx 20 yard line twice but
both times they were repulsed as
the Southwestern defense would
stiffen. The only score in the first
half came on a 74 yard punt re-
turn by Jones for the Lynx. The
halftime score showed the Generals
down 7 to 0 in a game that was
truly a defensive struggle.

Early in the second half the
chances of a Blue comeback were
dealt a severe blow. Jim Farrar was
forced to leave the game with a
badly jammed thumb, Not only had
he been running well, but he com-
plimented Van Amburgh greatly
with his excellent blocking. This also
weakened the pass blocking as he
was important to picking up any-
one who got through the line. The
Farrar nullified the Gen
erals’ otherwise strong ground game
forcing Fluharty to put the ball in
ihe air.

However, he only managed to
complete 10 passes in 29 attempts

and two interceptions, both coming
in the second half. One of those
went for a 36 yard touchdown for
the final scoring effort of the game.
The Blue never really made any
kind of a scoring effort during the
entire second half and the game
ended with the score 14 to 0.

If a highlight can be found in a
game such as this, it would have
to be the Generals defense. They
did an excellent job throughout the

game in holding Southwestern to
only 221 yards total offense. The
Blue’s offense must improve this

week for they only totaled 232 yards
for the game.

Next week W&L will meet Deni-
son in a home game and they'd
better be emotionally high, or they
will be blown out of the stadium.
Denison carries a 6-1-1 record and
a good offense into the big Parents’
Weekend contest. They have aver-
aged almost 30 points a game. They
will be bigger than the Blue, and
also very quick on both offense and
defense. Last year the Generals up-
set a strong Coast Guard team with

a superb team effort and they'd need
a similar output if they’re to over-
come Denison.

Win CAC Title

Washington and Lee's — strong
cross-country team, fresh from win-
ning the College Athletic Confer-
ence championship last Saturday,
will close out its season Friday at
home against Madison and Eastern
Mennonite.

The Generals are 7-1 in dual
meets this year and will be favored
to defeat both visiting teams on
W&L’s 5-mile course. The interest-
ing competition is the head-to-head
meeting of W&L’s Stu Nibley and
Madison’s no, 1 runner, Greg
Gerlach.

Gerlach recently broke a course
record in winning the Virginia Col-
lege Athletic Association (VCAA)
meet at Bridgewater, beating Nibley
by 12.5 seconds. But Nibley broke
the W&L course record last Satur-
day to lead W&L to its conference
chamionship,

The W&L sophomore shaved 18
seconds off the old mark, running
the 4.1 miles in 22:07, W&L won
the conference championship with
a team total of 35 points, edging
strong Sewanee which had 41.
Centre College was a close third
with 52 points, while Southwestern
trailed with 106.

The CAC meet was a close one.
After the first four runners for both
W&L and Sewanee had finished,
the two teams were tied with 23
points each. W&L’s fifth man, Bill
Garrison, placed 12th ahead of
Sewanee’s Clark Scott, who was
18th, to win it.

Scoring for W&L were Nibley
first; freshman Jim McMenamin
fourth, Bill Kalal eighth, Mike Burns
10th, and Garrison. Others who
finished high were Jim Ruth 13th
behind Garrison, Tim Washington
14th, and Bob Sherwood 15th.

nation with a half-season of  pig-
skin ‘heroics.

Indeed, these finely tuned Red-
skins have devoured the NFC’s
Eastern division with surprising ease
in compiling an enviable 7-1 won-
lost record, the latest triumph a
35-17 crushing of Joe Namath’s
illustrious crew. In Larry Brown,
they hold football's most proficient
runner, while Bill Kilmer’s wobbly
passes effectively soothe recent
memories of a hard-drinking red-
head’s picturebook tosses, The team
appears headed for post-season
grandeur and abundant wealth,
though haunted by fears of an age-
induced slump when December's
critical games arrive.

Certainly, these football Redskins
have aroused the ungodly cackles of
long-silent supporters, basking in the
glow of success so long denied them.
so long denied them. For years, the
ardent fans of a hapless franchise
cowered in dark corners on Sunday
afternoon, fearful of the maimings
t be inflicted upon their less than
heroic bunch by the titans of a
finer, now distant era: the Packers,
Giants, Colts.

But no longer, to be a Redskin
fan is to own the University Cen-
ter’s TV set at that blessed time
when Washington’s blessed ones take
to the turf for their weekly lessons
in excellence. Harried Colt patrons
flee, with the embarrassment of a
2-6 season firmly imprinted in their
minds.

Even Dallas’ stubborn  rooters
quiet their crowings in the presence
of their strutting foes. It is indeed
a strange, disquieting year.

At any rate, our capital rumbles
with the noises of rare football
affluence and Indian woes. Sadly, |
find myself believing that George
Allen’s brutes will capture greater
attention in this elequent autumn
than will maligned humanity in its
efforts to secure a bit of justice for
a proud race and | wonder why.

The pouting lap dog of lust,

candescence stoked by his hovering
over the sexuality of Troilus and
Cressida. DeCristopher also possess-

they do have, but I’m not griping
about having to put up with them.
What the music is about needs no

My only quarrel with the pro-

anticlimax that duped the audience
into early applause. The battle
scene is terminated, then brought
back for Troilus’ lamentation.
Pandarus’ final address to “Good

a lessening of ultimate impact. This
last speech infects eternity with the

maintenance building. The older
buildings of the front campus, e.g.
Washington Hall and the Lee-Jack-
son House, are in great need of
restorative work.

Perhaps the facades of these build-
ings could be changed to match
the newer structures, Sand-blasted
concrete and black-tinted glass might
improve the looks of the Colonnade
buildings but probably not. Some-
one suggested that parking facilities
be built somewhere between campus
and Buena Vista. This plan was re-
jected as parking space is obvi-
ously too extensive at present. If
the campus is doomed to become a
gross mixture of the early nineteenth
century and 2001 let us hope that
prospective applicants and visitors
do not judge books by cover or
schools by appearance.

Recruiting Funds Denied

By JOHN ZINK
The Student Recruitment Com-
mittee failed Monday night to pro-
cure funds from the Executive Com-

mittee to establish a “scholarship
weekend” for select high school
students applying to Washington

and Lee.

Larry Evans, chairman of the Stu-
dent Recruitment Committee, pres-
ented a plan to establish a scholar-
ship weekend aimed at a limited and
select group of applicants in an at-
tempt to have them enter Washing-
ton and Lee. Evans stated that these
students represent “a special inter
est group” to which the University
itself can not pay special attention
in recruiting.

Bill Merrill, EC vice-president,
pointed out to the EC members that
the Evans proposal would eat up
about one-half of the present bud-
get and that the money would have
io come out of the reserve fund
Bob Brennan, EC president, express-
ed his approval of the project. Bren-
nan “This project should be
tried on an experimental basis, not
to set a precedent.”

Law School representatives Henry
Jernigan said that the proposal was
a good idea but that this was the

said,

responsibility of the University and
no that of the students through
tie EC, Junior Mike Brittin voiced

his support of Evan's proposal and
suid, “This is a good time to have

more responsibility in getting a
more diverse student body.”

Rick Gray, disagreed, saying that
the students should not be required
to shoulder the responsibility. Ar-
cher Frierson said, “I think it is a
special interest and that is why I am
against it.” The EC voted six in
favor and five against; the motion
failed, needing a two-thirds major-
ity in order to carry.

In other business, Frank Porter,
president of the University Federa-
tion, was able to gain access to the
EC's funds for the support of his

organizations community — service
projects of the Winter Clothing

Drive and the Food for Needy Pro-
gram. Porter pointed out the great
need which exists in the surround-
ing community for group action such
as this. He explained that W&L stu
dents will give about $850 to the
clothing program while the IFC will
give $100 to the food program.
Porter requested that the EC give
$50 to be divided between these pro
The EC passed this request in
a resolution, Porter told the mem
bers that his group would be col
lecting from students in order to
buy clothes for the needy children
of Rockbridge County and to pay
for Thanksgiving baskets for area
families, Strong support was voiced
for these programs and it was urged
that the students do all that is pos
sible to help the successful comple

Drug Charges

Arrests were made during the af-
ternoon by a squad comprised of
State, County, and City police.

Sisler said that undercover work
had been in progress for over a
year and acknowledged that the
Lexington arrests were “pretty much
the end of it.”

He said that at least two more
arrests had yet to be made. Bond
was set at $10,000 for the first
count and $1,000 for every addi-
tional account for each of those
arrested. The pre-trial hearing has
been set for December 6, at which

time the trial date will be deter-
mined,
Four state troopers posed as

“customers and friends” of the ac-
cused, The troopers were: T. S.
Savard, W. B. Taylor, T. J. Rose-
berry, and W. H. Fowle,

Penalties for drug convictions in
Virginia range from five to forty
years per count. Sisler said that simi-
lar charges in Roanoke led to “some
pretty steep sentences.”

Information on the arrests was
withheld throughout the night, and
the local sheriff's office denied ac-
cess to police records.

All the arrests were made in off-
campus apartments, and no univer-
sity buildings were entered by the
authorities. There were no indica-
tions that any students were involv-
ed in the undercover work,

University officials said that they
were not notified in advance of the
indictments and had no previous
knowledge of the operation. Lewis
G. John, Dean of Students, said the
university would “be of assistance
in any way we can,” but could not
provide either bond or counsel for
the arrested students.

THE RING-TUM PHI

   

OUTLOOK and REVIEW
Autonomy for the Law School

As was reported in our last issue, many law students be-
lieve they don’t have enough control over their own affairs.
This was the message carried to the Executive Committee
by law school representatives Jeff Twardy and Henry Jerni-
gan, and an investigation was set into motion to determine the
feasibility of granting the Law School greater autonomy.
While no specific demands were set forth, it is generally
thought that the eventual goal is separate administration by
the law students of their honor system and their student
government.

While the implications of this proposal are obviously mom-
entous, it surely must not come as a surprise to anyone who
has been around W&L for any length of time. The ties be-
tween the undergraduate students and the law students have
become fewer and fewer over the years; if complete autonomy
for the law school were to come in the near future, it would
be a mere formalization of a break which has been developing
for some time now.

With Dean Roy Steinheimer presiding, the character and
composition of the Washington and Lee School of Law has
been altered radically. No longer was Tucker Hall to be the
refuge of would-be lawyers straight from W&L and VMI.
Courses have become tougher, and admissions requirements
have become more stringent. The policy was deliberately aim-
ed to attract more students from other undergraduate in-
stitutions and to place Washington and Lee among the most
competitive law schools in the South.

While this may mean real progress for the Law School’s
reputation, it certainly has not brought the undergraduates and
law students closer together. On the contrary, since most of
the current law students are products of other colleges, they
cannot relate to the W&L experience—be it the social life or,
more important, the honor system.

In addition, several other factors have contributed to mak-
ing the alienation more acute: (a) an increasing percentage of
law students are married, (b) their average age seems to have
increased, widening the gap of years between the undergradu-
ates and the law students, and (c) there is a natural tendency
for students to consort with those in their own discipline.

The completion of the new Lewis complex, then, should
be icing on the cake. The law students will at that time become
physically isolated as well.

We are not assigning blame for this situation, Let’s face
it: plenty of law students are downright condescending toward
undergraduates and wouldn't have anything to do with them
under any circumstances. But, all things considered, their de-
sire to detach themselves from undergraduate affiliations in
understandable.

The question, therefore, is this: precisely how and to what
extent should this be accomplished? While redistribution of
student governmental powers would be essentially a proce-
dural matter, a transferal of honor system authority would
have crucial implications for the whole university.

‘To consider the first aspect, it is conceded that the operat-
ing budgets for both the undergraduate schools and the law
school are under the same umbrella. Also, the student body
tax, paid by law students and undergraduates alike, is handled
and distributed by the EC.

The claim has been made that the law students are getting
a bad deal for their money. It is true that out of the $17 tax,
only $1.40 goes specifically to law school projects (namely,
the Law News and the Student Bar Association). The re-
mainder, however, goes in large part to funding programs
which do, either directly or indirectly, benefit law students
(i.e., the Contact speaker symposium, the campus film pro-
uram, the University Theater productions—all free of admis-
sion for law students). The advantages of the undergraduates
and the law students being able to pool their resources for
these programs are clear, Considering, in addition, the por-
tion of the assessments that must go toward maintaining
several reserve funds, we are not persuaded that law students
are paying more than their fair share.

When we enter the realm of the honor system, we face a
stickier question, This has, after all, been the primary con-
cern of the current law student body. Polled by the EC a
few weeks ago, a whopping 75% believed the law school
should be able to administrate its own honor system; 62%
favored a graduated penalty for convictions.

And what has perhaps bothered the law students most of
all are the recent EC revisions aimed at eliminating the ad-
versary system from honor trials, 84% said they favored a
formal guarantee of due process.

Mr. Jernigan stated before the EC that the present system
“noses threats or ambiguity” towards law school students.
They are apprehensive about being judged before a pri
marily undergraduate body.

While we cannot see why a law student should feel “threat
ened” by an undergraduate’s decision in an honor trial, we do
acknowledge that there is some question as to whether or not
he is being tried before his peers, But in contemplating any
changes touching on the honor system, the EC must tread
very, very carefully,

There can never be two different stanadrds of honor on
this campus, Believe it or not, undergraduates do look to the
law students for an example of proper judgment. Were the
latter to abandon the present honor system for a weaker, dis
tilled version, the consequences could be disastrous for the
whole tradition of a trustful community at Washington and
Lee

Fillmore Z3X 31390

W. PAT HINELY

Hot on the heels of the film
shown at the Lyric this past week,
entitled Fillmore, we have the album
of the same name, giving us the
music,

Here, at last, is what the average
East-coast rock fan has needed for
quite some time: an anthology, or
a better word would be sampler—
at any rate, contained within this
3-record set, along with all the Bill

Graham sentimental and _ historical
mush and jabbering, along with
some very nice packaging, is an

honest, thorough, and excellent as-

sortment of music that serves quite
well as an introduction and survey
to the music of San Francisco .

Al the big-name bands deliver
what they’re known for: first-class,
if not inspired music. Good enough
to get people dancing or else im-
mobilized in assorted states of con-
sciousness, The lesser-known “local”
Bay-area bands, such as Lamb,
Tower of Power, and Stoneguard,
also come off quite well.

The arrangement and sequencing
of the sides and inclusion of so much
talking detract from the album as a
musical work, but add to its histori-
cal perspective. This perspective, un-
fortunately, is pretty useless and
meaningless “back East,” unless you
hapened to be part of the Fillmore
West experience.

A Professor’s View Of The Arts

It was very pletasing to see so
much space given to the arts in last
Wednesday's edition—notice of a
Theater production, an editorial cri-
tical of architectural disasters on the
campus, and a report on the discus-
sion of art needs by the University
Council. | would like to make a few
comments on the editorial and the
University Council discussion.

The “neglect of the arts at Wash-
ington and Lee” was the subject dis-

cussed by the Council. There have
been pressing needs in art, music and
theater for some time but I do not
believe that “neglect” is he right
word, benign or otherwise. I feel
confident that the administration is
well aware of our “growing pains.”

I can remember that in 1948, the
year before art became a part of
the university program, the student
editor of the humor magazine (now
defunct) wrote an article ridiculing
the introduction of art to the cur-
riculum in an all-male college. He
predicted that students would be
swishing over the campus in smocks
and that students in the dormitories
would have model-mistresses in
every room. (I have not checked on
the dorms lately.)

He was expressing student and
perhaps even some faculty opposi-
tion to this new department which

 

 

 

Is P.E. Necessary?

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

There is one aspect of our great
institution that I was appalled at
1 first arrived here. Now, three
years later, it seems more ridicul-
ous than ever, | am referring to re-
quired Physical Education.

When people ask about WAL—
most are surprised to hear that we
are not coed, But when they hear
that | am taking volleyball or bad-
miton, they laugh, then ask, “What
university would still have required
P.E.!" The only answer that I can
give them is “a very backward,
conservative, Southern institution.”

As I understand it, this subject
has been raised about once a year
for the past few years in the Exe-
cutive Committee and University
Council meetings. What | cannot
understand is why these commit-
tees, Which are supposed to repre-
sent the student body, do not do
something about this matter.

Do these committees feel that the
majority of the students want re-
quired P. E.? | sincerely doubt it,
In fact, | predict that if a poll was
taken of the student body stating:
“Do you approve of required P, E.?"
over 3/4 o fthe students would vote
“NO.”

Again | ask why hasn't our stu-
dent government done something
about it? Of course there will be
“red tape” to go through—but if
our great E C did act on this issue,
I feel that it would gain more sup-
port and respect from the student
body because they finally did some-
thing worthwhile.

Now please do not misunderstand
me. I'm not complaining because
my coach is making me run a “burn
out” for my bowling class—or even
that he's telling us we must do
“homework” during ‘Thanksgiving

vacation—which most of his pupils
will not do, then lie about when
asked (thus hurting the honor sys-
tem).

I'm just trying to point out that,
as far as I can tell, the only reasons
we still have required P. EB. are:
1) The administration (who does not
have to go through this “Mickey
Mouse”) is behind it—and they just
built us a new gym, 2) the coaching
staff is numerous and wants to stay
powerful in the school bureaucracy,
and 3) our student government has
done little about this annoying
matter,

I honestly feel that nobody at the
age of 17 or older should be told
that he must take five P. BE, courses
for one credit or he will not gradu-
ate, What possible reason is there to
support required P. E.? It is as
dumb as freshman beanies.

Mr. Richardson's letter of two
weeks ago lacks sufficient ground
in its protest of Mr. Faillace’s let-
ter for the following reasons: This
past Sunday, I worked at the Cock-
pit for seven and a half hours. When
I finished, I strolled up to the gym
and played two games of handball;
then I ran a mile and a few sprints.
Weary from the day's toils and
games, | descended four stories, only
to find that the saunas were closed,

Due to the fact that humans, by
their nature, consider themselves to
be above all else I find the issue of
the regulations on sauna use to be
very pertinent to the individuals of
the Washington and Lee community,
Finally, | view Mr. Richardson's
ideas as being high-flown and as
representative of overkill on the en-
fife meatier

he deemed trivial. Now we have
students demanding more art and
professors of Law and English urg-
ing that our needs be met. This is
quite a change but it did not happen
“overnight.” Twenty-three years of
hard work are involved. One might
as well say that the rocket to the
moon happened instantly.

As far as neglect is concerned I
can remember when art history lec-
tures were given in a cement-walled
room in the library basement. This
room was nicknamed “The Egyp-
tian Tea Room” due to the old
drapes hung from the ceiling to re-
duce the third echo. The studio was
a small room on the third floor of
Reid Hall.

We had 600 slides to work with
instead of our present collection of
15,500, There was no budget and
exhibitions had to be borrowed from
friends—called for and returned.
Except for one course taught by a
former professor it was a one man
department and that man taught
three lecture courses in the morn-
ing, studio in the afternoons, did all
the exhibitions and all the office
work with no secretary.

Then came duPont Hall—that
“Mock Colonade at it’s very worst.”
DuPont Hall was made possible by
an initial gift from the family of a
student who wanted to help improve
the art situation. With this initial
gift the Board of Trustees decided
to add to the gift and build a $350,-
000 Fine Arts Building.

This decision was an embarrass-
ment as many older departments
had been waiting years for better
space, and the 60 or so art students
would have rattled around in sur-
plus space. The dean and I agreed
that the best solution was to “give”
part of the building to other acade-
mic classes and retain the rear half
for art. This made it possible to
hide the “modern” building, which
art needed, with a conventional fac-
ade facing the campus as a truly
modern structure was not visably
acceptable.

This generosity almost resulted in
disaster as a new building commit-
tee, without our representation, was
appointed and this committee came
up with the lovely idea of a square
“collegiate colonial” structure and
relegated art to the attic and base-
ment. Needless to say this was not
acceptable to art and there were
some heated words,

The final result was duPont Hall,
a bastard building but functional in
it’s studio, gallery and auditorium.
(Poor man’s Frank Lloyd Wright in
the back and just plain Mary Ann
in front.) It was not long before the
influx of students made us question
our wisdom in “giving away” need-
ed space,

Returning to the idea of “over-
night” growth of the Art Depart-
ment, this seems like a logical con-
clusion until it is recognized that
for some years a strict limit had

“Apathy” has been a common
charge leveled at Washington and
Lee students, particularly in the
realm of their own campus affairs.
Bob Wilson, thinks that many stu-
dents with the most potential are re-
maining, sadly, uninvolved. Many
of them, he says, were those disil-
lusioned with W&L in part when
English instructor Henry Sloss was
denied tenure last year. Below, he
offers an outlook on this dilemma.

—Fd.

By BOB WILSON

Henry Sloss is gone, And most
people around W&L are probably
glad of it. This essay is not so much
for them as for those who believed
in him and miss him as I do, For
although it was not you who believ-
ed in him that felt threatened by
him, it was to you, to us, that he
directed his most severe criticism,
and it is about this that I write.

Although Mr, Sloss used to, |
think, always try to see the best in
any person or situation, he had
harsh words for what he described
as the ‘Great American Voyeur’
who is pleased to consider himself
somehow removed from some situa-
tion in which he is really involved.
You cannot be in a situation and not
in a situation, he'd say.

For example, you cannot be at
Washington and Lee and not be at
Washington and Lee. You cannot,
not merely because it is logically
impossible, but because you and
your life and what you can do for
those around you is too important
for you to sit back and detachedly
observe it, Even if what is going on
at W&L or wherever you find your-
self does not seem important to you,
you cannot merely observe a com-
munity of which you are a part,
but must make something of it.

What does that have to do with
us, me and those of you that cared
about what Mr. Sloss had to say?
He would never come right out and
tell us, would he? No, and the rea-
son he would not is he thought it
wrong to tell others how to live

their lives, to give them an ‘action
program’ as he would call it. In-
stead he objectively presented us
with a sketch of what he thought
was true, Mr. Sloss would never try
to make a story out of the truth.
This, he thought, would be using
knowledge as a source of power
over others, and that he would not
do,

Knowing less, | am not nearly as
humble as Mr. Sloss. I hate to show
that I learned poorly, but I think 1
see what the ‘Voyeur’ had (has) to
do with us, and I’m going to tell
you about it. First, a short sketch of
my own:

—a group of people at W&L,
hundreds maybe, who feel terribly
out of place here, who think there
might be something wrong not only
with the average W&L stud, but
with much about campus life; they
want to dissociate themselves from
the studs and this environment; they
live ‘in the country’ or an apart-
ment in town and speak contemptu-
ously of ‘the others’ with whom they
sce themselves as having no rela-
tion—

Familiar? It is to me. It is of
us that I think Mr, Sloss was think-
ing when he spoke. We are wrong.
We cannot be at Washington and
Lee and not be at Washington and
Lee. If we think we can sit back
and smoke dope and say how screw-
ed up this campus is without say-
ing also how screwed up we are,
we are quite wrong.

It is sad, too, Sad for W&L and
sad for us, Among us are, I think,
the most imaginative people at
W&L. We are the people who have
the most potential for making this a
good place to be.

And what do we do but sit back
and let ‘the others’ run the place?
You may not think so, but the fac-
ulty and administration have done a
lot to let students control their lives
here, not only socially but acade-
mically and aristically, They have
set up ways for students to work for
what they want. For example, stu-
dents are members of faculty com-
mittees now, like the curriculum
committee which decides which
courses will be offered to you. Do
you know what happens? Invari-
ably the student on the committee
turns out to be more conservative
than the faculty members. That is
because most of the really enlight-
ened students are too haughty to
get involved,

Last year there was a_ student
here named Don Marshall, who had
a rather low opinion of W&L, For
a while he muttered under his
breath and thought about transfer-
ing, but then he hit upon an idea
which would make his life here and
life in general at W&L a little more
bearable, He decided to become edi-
tor of the Calyx and create the first
artistic and interesting yearbook
that we have ever had. And he did.
He was just one person though, and
already what he has done has been
discredited by ‘the others’ who are
using their influence to see that it
doesn’t happen again. It probably
won't unless someone else steps
forward,

Everyone can't be editor of the
Calyx of course, but almost anyone
can. | am editor of the Ariel this
year, and do you know why? (Be-
cause the publications board decided
that | would be the most brilliant

editor of all those who asked for
the job? Hardly.) Because | was the
only one to apply. Surprising? Well
only one person applied for every
position on any of the publications
and they became this year’s editors.
This is not to say that they were
not the most qualified people for
the job,

You only need to look and it will
be clear that there is a lot that can
be done, and you can do it as well
or better than it is being done now.

what you can do. They have lots of
good ideas,

Everyone knows that you have
another choice besides loving or
leaving a place where you find your-
self. You can also fix it. Washington
and Lee needs fixing. If you are
here at W&L, you cannot not be
here. Mr. Sloss knew it. He told us,
Now we should act.

The Supreme Tortures
Of The 8:00 a.m. Class

By CHIP MARTIN

Washington and Lee's formal
statement of institutional philosophy
is: “Fundamental to all other as-
pirations of Washington and Lee
University is the pursuit of its edu-
cational purpose in a climate of
learning that stresses the importance
of the individual, his personal honor
and integrity, his harmonious rela-
tionship with his fellowman, and his
responsibility to serve society
through the productivity of his
training and his talent.”

True, the University does stress
the importance of the individual,
his personal honor and so on, but
does it always provide “a climate of
learning?” No, it does not. The
notorious Period A, beginning at
8:00 a.m., is far from this “climate
of learning.”

During his four year stay at the
University, the average student is
more than likely—unless he is ex-
tremely lucky—to encounter the in-
humane experience of the 8:00 a.m.
class. He will get up as late as pos-
sible, eat whatever he can in the
five minutes before class, and pull
himself up the hill.

Once in class, the typical student
will be alert and attentive, right?
Wrong. The typical student, we
shall call him Joe Typical for lack
of a better name, is awake, but not
really. Joe’s body is in class, but his
mind is back in bed. He can see the
professor's lips move, but he doesn't
hear them.

Soon Joe is completely gone.
After Joe's name has been called a
number of times, he realizes that
the question is being directed toward
him. The heat is on, Fumbling,
coughing and stalling for time, Joe

 

searches his numbed mind for an
answer,

Sometimes he gets lucky and an-
swers correctly. The heat is off and
so is Joe’s mind. If he answers in-
correctly, Joe gets nervous and at-
tempts to “tune in” to the discus-
sion, But it is all futile. Joe emerges
at 8:50 a.m. having learned very
little.

Not only does Joe learn very lit-
tle in Period A, but he has to pay
just as much for it as a later class in
which he learns much more, Joe
shells out $1,150.00 per semester
for his tuition, Each academic course
costs him approximately $287.00.
Can a course given to a sleepy stu-
dent at 8:00 a.m. be worth as much
as a course taught in the late morn-
ing or afternoon when he is more
attentive?

If 8:00 a.m. clases are so unpro-
ductive, why, then, do they exist?
William Watt, the Dean of the Col-
lege, gives one good reason: There
is a limited amount of classroom
space which necessitates an extra
period to accommodate all students.
According to Dean Watt, the faculty
voted a few years back to have
classes at 8:00 am. He further
states that as far as he can see,
there is no dissent among the fac-
ulty concerning 8:00 a.m. classes
and if there is, he would be happy
to hear from them.

Ah, but there is dissent. In a ran-
dom survey of ten professors, seven
voiced displeasure over Period A.
The words of one dissenting profes-
sor aptly sum up the whole: “I dis-
like them not necessarily for my-

self, but because students are at
about 65% capacity.”

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

Steve Fluharty was under great pressure from the Denison Redmen. Coach Leslie thought that the Blue’s
last two games would be their toughest. “After last Saturday, it loks like I was right.”

    
 

RING-TUM PHI

The combination of the number
52 and the color red meant victory
for two football teams in Lexington
this past weekend. On Friday the
Lexington High beat  arch-rival
Parry McClure 52-0. On Saturday
the Big RED from Denison Univer-
sity invaded Big Lex and beat the
Washington and Lee Generals in a
BIG way, the final score being 52-

The game was a case of one team
simply outclassing the other. Deni-
son was bigger, faster, stronger, and
on the whole better than the Gen-
erals. Led by senior running back
Ed Exler, Denison’s offense picked
up 419 yards in total offense to the
Generals 255 yards. Another statistic
that tells the story of the game is
that Denison had 173 return yards
(runbacks of punts, interceptions,
and fumbles) to W&L’s 29, Many of
Denison’s yards were picked up by
Fed Guylas. All he did was return
three punts for 111 yards and inter-
cept two passes for another 56 yards.
His play alone helped set up 23 of
Denison’s points,

The only thing W&L won all day
was the coin toss. After taking the
opening kickoff the Generals were
forced to punt. Enter Mr. Guylas,
He took Chappy Conrad's punt at
his own 10 and returned it 60 yards
to the W&L 30. Six plays later Jim
Bailey kicked a 32 yard field goal to
give Denison the lead for good.

The Generals got the ball back
but were again forced to punt....
Guylas again gave the Big Red ex-
cellent field position, returning this
punt 44 yards to the W&L 15. Exler
then scored from the one, and the

conversion made it 10-0. He later
added three more scores, and in the
process upped his career rushing
total to 3954 yards, a new Ohio
Conference Record.

For the Generals it was simply a
day where nothing went right. Ear-
lier in the week fullback Jim Far-
rar, Who was doubtful anyhow due
to a jammed thumb, suffered a rup-
tured appendix. Also missing was de-
fensive lineman Arch Christian, who
had an ankle injury, Enough said
for the injury list. Back to the game,

It just wasn’t the Generals’ day.
Steve Fluharty did throw a_ touch-
down pass to Chappy Conrad, but it
was obvious that Flu didn’t have it
as he had four aerials picked off.

Coach Buck Leslie inserted Lewis
Powell in the third quarter, Powell
moved the team well, but it was too
late, Under his direction W&L scor-
ed twice, on a 37 yard run by Mer-
cer West and a 6 yard scoring pass
from Powell to Conrad.

This week the Generals play their
season finale against Washington
University. Gametime is 2:00 P.M.

Football Cards Draw
Local Betting Money

By TOM HONAKER

Wednesday afternoons in the Fall
wing a diverse string of emotions
rom many Washington and Lee
tudents and Lexington residents. At
his time, some are receiving their
‘ightful remuneration for a job well
lone; while others sit in utter self-
lisdain, realizing the sloppy per-
‘ormance turned in the week be-
‘ore. All who aren't utterly discour-
iged look forward to the weekend
ind the moment the scores come
across the air.

On Wednesday afternoon the
‘runners” come to Lexington. These
semi-delivery boys bring the money
‘or the previous week’s winners and
cards for the coming week's specu-
ator,

You would be surprised at the
number of people playing these “for
amusement only” cards—not only in
college towns, but in thriving met-
ropolitan areas, cards can be pro-
cured. The usual places to find
these cards are in country clubs,
bars, and general places of pleasure.
However, in many cases, they are
brought around to laborers at work,
Cards aren't only for the executive
type. At home, | played my cards
at a used miner’s clothing shop with
a toothless wonder named Nick.
Nick would bet his welfare money in
hopes of receiving some extra booze
money. He would hit at least 80%
of the time.

In case you're wondering about
the legality of these little gems, you
might be interested to know that it
is the location of the printing and
the consequent distribution of the
cards that determine their relative
acceptability by the legal authority.

If the card is printed in Virginia,
and doesn’t leave the state, it will
be a rarity for the state to do any-
thing more than frown on_ this.
However, an immediate crackdown
can be expected for cards becoming
interstate commerce. These cards
are bought relatively out in the
open, and it’s not unusual to see
many people of high legal and poli-
tical office with three hot bets for
Saturday. In fact the Washington
Post carried two articles on foot-
ball cards and bookies in their previ-
ous issues this fall.

There is no iron-clad rule that
can help you pick a winner on a
card, The minimum amount of
teams that can be picked is three,
and the maximum is ten, There are
a few pointers that seem to hold
favor with all successful prognosti-
cators. The first and by far the most
important of these is to be well in-
formed on your subject. Know which
team is home, look up last year’s
score, and see what each team did
the previous week. You can sub-
scribe to a publication that will not
only itemize scores and home teams,

but go into minute details of ex-
pected weather, team injuries, team
morale and unbelievable miscellane-
ous items. One such item was print-
ed before this year’s U.Va.-W.Va.
game, The publication stated “West
Virginia is definitely not a good
choice this week due to the brain
surgery of Quarterback Bernie Ga-
liffa’s wife. The mental condition of
Galiffa is at best unstable due to his
wife’s condition. When he’s hot, so
are the Mountaineers. He’s not, so
take U.Va.” The following Satur-
day in Charlottesville, Galiffa threw
for 377 yards as W.Va. romped
over U.Va, 48-10.

Secondly, never bet against your-
self on two or more different cards.
In the same light, don’t bet on the
same team too many times on diff-
erent cards, Finally, remember that
it is highly dangerous to bet on a
team about which you feel any
strong emotions. These feelings can
distort your objective view of the
game and you will pay in dollars.

It is hard to generalize about
which teams to take, and they do
differ from year to year. This year
the pros seem to be erratic and hard
to pick, Colleges seem to be easier,
but there are surprises in those
ranks, too, Usually anyone well-in-
formed could come out a big win-
ner from the Ivies, but that is not so
this year. My father used to play
Dartmouth every week and he very
rarely lost—they constantly beat
their point spread. But the bettor’s
perrenial favorites Dartmouth and
Yale lost on the card this week, and
other teams in other sections must
be found. It seems the best picks are
the big point spreads from the Mid-
west and West. Iowa State may re-
place Dartmouth as the prognosti-
cator’s favorite. It's a rare occasion
that a team like Nebraska will make
the card because they will casily
beat the point spread, but in the
same light, I've never seen V.M.1.
on a card either.

Football cards can be most en-
joyable and very profitable. If you're
not too tense and can wait for Sat-
urday’s score, it can be a gratifying
experience to see how well you've
done. Your performance will be a
mixture of luck and skill. Some
hunches win and some of the most
well planned and researched picks
fail. Only Wednesday afternoon and
the “runner” will tell.

Soccer Season Ends In Win

By PAUL CAVALIERE

The Washington and Lee soccer
team closed its 1972 season Thurs-
day with a 4-1 victory over VPI.
The win boosted the team’s final re-
cord to 6-2-2, but was small con-
solation for the generally disappoint-
ing year the Blue felt they had. In
the words of Coach Lyles, “This
year is our year. All we have to do
is just put it together,”

W&L just could not “put it to-
gether” when it most counted, The
1-0 loss to Madison College was the
Generals’ crucial set-back; it en-
abled Madison to qualify for three
post-season tournaments.

Although dissatisfied with their ex-
clusion from the post-season con-
tests, the Blue can be justifiably
proud of their respectable and hard-
earned winning season. Many times
during the season the Generals ex-
hibited the traits of a true cham-
pionship team, At these times the
Generals would have been more
than a match for any soccer squad
in the region.

In the Virginia Tech game, W&L
displayed these characteristics, but
not until after they had played over
an hour of mediocre soccer, VPI

was leading 1-0 when the Generals
finally caught up with their poten-
tial and started really playing soccer,
In a span of four minutes the Blue
erupted for four goals, while their
goalie Jeff Baum checked the Gob-
blers with excellent goal-tending.
Mike Schaeffer, John Buckley, Jim
Fox, and Cleve McGee each tallied
a score, as the Generals finished the
season in a small blaze of glory.
Five Generals have been nomi-
nated for All-Conference honors:
linemen Meade Kampfmueller, Mike
Schaeffer, Jim Fox, and backs Rolf
Piranian and Barclay Armstrong.

Already the Generals are looking
forward to the 1973 season, and all
the present indications point to a
bright future for W&L soccer. Next
year’s captains have already been
selected, The new team leaders are
Rolf Piranian and Bill Spofford.
The team will lose only three start-
ers to graduation, and there is a
wealth of freshman and sophomores
ready to fill the vacated positions,
If the Blue can reap a rich harvest
of entering freshmen, and more im-
portantly, coordinate their talents
and resources into a powerful soc-
cer unit, the 1973 season could well
be the Generals’ year to shine.

been placed on the number of stu-
dents admitted. Five years ago all
but one art course was closed be-
fore the end of the spring registra-
tion. The last two years the courses
have been open to all so it looks
like a sudden explosion.

Neither plan is very fair. Closing
the course means many students are
turned away. Opening the course is
often unfair to the teacher. To have
47 students in a sculpture studio
suitable for about 17 is not satisfac-
tory, Adding another studio section
means adding 9 hours, not 3, to the
teaching load.

Yes, there are pressing needs.

Cheater, or a new Theater and other
expansion. This needed space is pe-

culiar space in that studios need
light, accoustics need to be consider-
ed in areas for music and the theat-
er.

Being optimistic | believe these
needs will be met, but I do not ad-
vise Washington and Lee to have a
single large art center building, as
suggested at the Council meeting,
for several reasons. First, it might
be a long time in coming as it would
cost several million dollars. Sec-
ondly, there would be a_ conflict
over space between art, music and
theater. The history of most com-
bined buildings is for much com-
promise in space with the strongest
department taking over,

Thirdly, it is good to have the arts
scattered over the campus as in this
way more students will make con-
tact. An off-campus Fine Arts Cen-
ter in isolated splendor sounds good
but would not be as effective as du-
Pont where students from other de-
partments come in contact with the
art exhibitions and become interest-
ed,

In conclusion | firmly believe that
the needs of Art, if not the Theater,
can be met in the near future at a
reasonable cost and I expect some
thinking has been done along these
lines,

not getting enough sleep”? At W&L
it is very difficult to get to bed be-
fore 1:00 a.m. Road trips, pinball,
and, believe it or not, studies have
a way of keeping Joe up. Yes, this is
a fault, but it is not going to change
Joe.

The 8:00 a.m. class is unpopular
with students and faculty alike;
hence, a call for action. The faculty
should be well aware that the stu-
dents will stand behind them if they
choose to abolish the 8:00 a.m.
class. And, faculty, your superior,
Dean Watt, has even stated that he
would be receptive to your views.
The next regular faculty meeting is
scheduled for December 4. There is
sufficient time for you faculty mem-
bers to talk among yourselves, and
if you now find yourselves against
8:00 awm. classes, then move to
abolish them.

Meanwhile, all Joe Typical can
do is continue to endure the bar-
barity of the 8:00 a.m. class and to

voice his dissent.

doubt, this is the best 9 minutes on
the album,

Side 6 (welcome to side 6) is the
final night jam with Taj Mahal, El-
vin Bishop, and Boz Scaggs, along
with various members of several
bands playing and “splitting” as they
wished. The whole side is some of
the best spontaneous music ever
captured on recording tape. Taj
Mahal shows himself to be refined,
even in his raspy technique. Scaggs
and Bishop are both first-rate gui-
tarists in their own right, and like
the old saying goes, two heads are
better than one, It’s true.

The only major Bay-area band
not included in this set is the Jeffer-
son Airplane, but the Hot Tuna
rendition of “Keep Your Lamps
Trimmed and Burning” represents
those musicians and their general di-
rection quite well. The Chicano
bands, Santana and Malo, are al-
most explosive. The Grateful Dead,
well, they're the Grateful Dead.

Despite the commercialization in-
herent in any Bill Graham enter-
prise, the music makes this set a
worthwhile investment for anyone
who wants to get a good picture of
the overall Amerikan musical scene.
It’s worth listening to.

Last Saturday, W&L’s most suc
cessful Cross-Country team ever tra-
veled to Wheaton, Ill. to participate
in the national college division
chamionship meet. The Generals, to
say the least, found the calibre of
competition high. Super-soph Stu
Nibley finished only 125th in the
field of 450 runners. Other finishers
for the Blue were freshman Jim
McMenamin 214th, Bill Kalal 280th,
Mike Burns 307th, and Bill Garri-
son 311th. The Generals placed 47th
among 72 teams.

This season was a great one, Be
sides the 9-1 record, the Blue also
brought a College Athletic Confer-
ence Championship to Lexington,
and garnered a second place finish in
the state meet. Led by captains Bill
Kalal and Bob Sherwood, and paced
by Stu Nibley, the Generals were a
good combination of youth and ex-

perience. Much of their success was
attributable to the fine crop. of
freshmen, who were led by Jim

McMenamin, Bike Burns, and Bill
Garrison. The future looks bright,
says Coach Miller. Most of this
year’s squad will be returning.

EC Makes Loan

For New Journal

By MIKE

The Executive Committee, meet-
ing in a two hour session Monday,
tackled such varied problems as al-
locating money for a new Com-
merce newspaper, organizing — the
Plan and Development Committee,
and determining their view of dis-
cussing exams during the examina-
tion period,

Bill Merrill, EC vice-president
presented his proposal for a Com-
merce school newspaper that would
be chiefly composed of articles writ-
ten by prominent businessmen, poli-
ticians and commercial executives.
The purpose of the paper Merrill
noted, would be to fulfill the need
for communication between students
and the businessmen and _ politicians
on important topics of the present
and prospective solutions for the
future. Merrill proposed that the
paper would monetarily self-suffici-
ent, but like many other projects
needed money to get off the ground.
Afier an hour of heated debate,

A New Part of Foreign Studies Program

Seminar In England Offered

In addition to the already ¢s-
tablished programs in France,
Spain, Germany, and Africa, two
new foreign study courses are ap-
pearing in the curriculum this year
—one in England, the other in Ja-
pan. This week, we report on the
plans for the trip to Great Britain;
the plans for the Japan study will
be discussed here next week, —Ed.

Great Britain will be the site of
a new foreign study program to be

much of their time attending Eng-

of seven students must enroll in the
course if it is to be offered. Applica-
tion for enrollment in this year's
program should be made by Jan. 1,

Estimated cost of the course is
$750, according to Dr. Ray. The
estimate includes transportation,
food, lodging, and tickets to attend
productions. The Financial Aid

The addition of the two Spring

with the new Japan study program.
brings the total of foreign study
programs offered by Washington
and Lee to six. Programs are also
offered for study in France, Spain,
Germany, and East Africa.

The growth of the university's
foreign studies program in recent
years is a product of the university's
decision to follow a 12-12-6 semes-
ter plan. One of the expressed pur-
poses of the switch to such a semes
ter plan was to develop an exten-
sive program in foreign studies,

basically involve both indepedent re-
search and intensive contact with

country.

All three programs are open to

be eligible. Students in the programs

' Pre-Trial Hearing

Is Set

For Indicted Students

All ten students arrested two
weeks ago on charges of distribut-
ing various drugs have been released
on bond. The fourteen defendants,
students and locals, arrested as a
result of the year-and-a-half long
investigation must now wait until a
December 6 hearing at which a trial
date will be set.

The Washington and Lee students
have returned to classes, and, ac-
cording to Dean of Students Lewis
John, it is uncertain when (if any)
disciplinary action will be taken
against them by the university.

“Assuming the trial comes during
the academic year,” Dean John
said, “the Student Control Com-
mittee will, in all likelihood, con-
sider the cases after that time.”

John said that the reason for the
delay of disciplinary action was pri-
marily a practical one, It would be
impossible, he emphasized, for the
Student Control Committee to com-
pile evidence while the civil cases
were pending in the courts.

Several local lawyers have been
preparing for the defense of the
students. One group of five or six
students was successful in getting
their bond reduced to $5,000 cash
and $10,000 in property, for the

The East African study program,
sponsored by the Politics Depart-
ment, was instituted last year. The
program is offered in alternate
years, and any student who has
taken Politics 101 is eligible. Stu-
dents in the program will investi-
gate political, economic, and cul-
tural aspects of the young African
nations.

Christmas Party, Combo
Planned For The Cockpit

As a final fling before exams, the
University Center Committee has
planned a number of programs and
activities for the week ahead.

The traveling pair, Lenny and
Joelle, have been engaged for a live
concert in the Cockpit tomorrow
night, beginning at 9 p.m. On tour
along the Eastern Seaboard, the cou-
ple sings a mixture of folk music,
ballads, and mountain music. “They
appeared on campus last winter to
a large audience in the Cockpit,”
stated Ken Lane, “and we are look-
ing forward to their return.” Ad-
mission is free, Lane added.

On Tuesday, December 5, the
“Traveling Rainbow” jug band will
be in the Cockpit for a repeat en-
gagement. Led by student Al Tharpe
and by David Pelliciaro, son of Pro-
fessor Pelliciaro, the group will be-
gin at 7:30 p.m.

remarked Bob Bruyere, chairman of
the University Center Committee.

A Christmas tree will be placed in
the Cockpit and the party will be-
gin with a free-for-all tree trimming.
Egg nog (non-alcoholic) will be serv-

The University Center Committee
is making arrangements to see if the
Sazeracs will sing at the party. Re-

|OUTLOOK and REVIEW

November 29, 1972

The Drug Bust

By now, Everyone knows about the Bust—the
never really expected would come. While it didn't exactly
clean out the drug traffic in Lexington, it certainly did result
in a traumatic experience for ten Washington and Lee stu-

one we

dents and their friends,

Since the trial date for those indicted has not even been
set, it would be most presumptuous for us to toss off our opi-
nions on the case.

Suffice it to say the arrests did not exactly do wonders for
our suffering “Town and Gown” relations. The fact is that the
four state troopers who acted as undercover agents would not
have brought their operation here without the enthusiastic
invitation from local officials.

It is generally conceded that a couple of other students
have made quite a lot of money off drug exchange, but the
counts gathered against the current defendants over the fil-
teen-month investigation do not reveal any “big-time” opera-
tors among them. And, the story that the troopers purchased
from and smoked pot with the students has left a sour taste in
more than one mouth on this campus.

If any message can be culled from this experience, it is
this: the days of in loco parentis are truly and finally over, A
student cannot feel himself cloistered and immune from out-
side prosecution. And finally, every effort must be continued
to keep drugs out of university housing, to avoid an even more
frightening invasion.

On Milking The Alumni

Just before we all took for the Thanksgiving holidays, the
University sponsored its fifth annual conference for what was
termed as a “select group of alumni.” The lofty purpose, as
stated in the program brochure, was “to provide better com-
iunication and understanding between alumni and members
of the University family—faculty, students, and administra-
tion,”

Of course, most W&L students, being the cynical rascals
that they are, probably thought this was nothing but a ploy to
milk the alumni for some development cash, Crotehety, old
alumni would be herded around by a carefully-picked cadre
of conventionally-dressed student leaders—all the right an-
swers would be given to all those silly alumni-type questions.
And after they had been humored and reassured, the alumni
would go back home and send checks flowing back to campus.

But, lo and behold, this conference was different. To be
sure, a primary goal of the administration during this gather-
ing was to impress the alumni with what we were doing here,
so that they would leave Lexington feeling generous toward
our ambitious fund-raising campaigns. These alumni, not be-
ing a particularly stupid lot, realized this.

Yet there were many aspects of this conference which
demonstrated a sincere effort to avoid the hideous scenario
outlined above. First, the alumni came from all parts of the
country, from all sorts of professions—in short, were any-
thing but a purely upper-crust source for contributions, Sec-
ondly, many of the students invited to meet with the alumni
had no special excuse (i.¢., campus officer, editor, ete.) but
were there to participate as students.

What was really astonishing about this particular confer-
ence was the attentiveness and interest shown by the alumni
involved. Of course, since they arrived hot on the heels of a
drug bust and since many of these men had not been back to
Lexington since coats and ties disappeared, many of the ex-
pected questions got asked,

But, by and large, the seminars and discussions did not
dwell on these issues, but focused on a whole variety of prob-
lems, from black recruitment to upperclass housing.

lf any major conclusion could be drawn from these ses
sions, it was that the administration is failing to utilize these
energetic graduates to anywhere near their potential. For
example, during one discussion a couple of students were com-
plaining that lack of funds precluded any real progress in the
black recruitment program, One alumnus spoke up and asked,
why not contact the area alumni, and have them bring the pro
pectiv e student to campus? Several other alumni, one after
another, proceeded to offer his help in working in their local
ties with recruitment and admissions projects,

Certainly, we should not be seared of our alumni, They are

Dining Out In Greater Lexington

Good Times Await At “The Quid’

Many new students and townies
have begged us to provide an hon-
est survey of the culinary delights
to be found in the area. To answer
this plea, we begin a series of col-
umns on “Dining Out In Greater
Lexington.” Staff writer Jess Reeves
visited the Central Lunch (affec-
tionately known as “the Quid”) just
before Turkey Day and files our
inaugural report. —Ed.

By J. REEVES

You enter the door to the noise
and flashing lights of the pinball
machines that flank the entrance.
The place is filled with Pikas, mis-
cellaneous students, a few cadets and
fewer townies. Behind the counter
are cases upon cases of Old Mil
selling at $1.60 a six, Over the milk
cooler stands a white plastic duck.
All this tells you that you're in the
right place, This, in all its typical
Lexington splendor, is the Quid.

The early Rockbridge decor might
lead one to believe that the Quid
is just like any other townie hang-
out but this is far from true, As the
proprietor, Duck, will readily tell
you, Central Lunch caters to the
students of Washington and Lee
University rather than to the local-
yokel population.

This makes for a singularly high-
type clientel consisting primarily of
Red Square residents. The intimate
atmosphere and familiar patrons
make the visitor feel right at home,
assuming that he has lived in Lex-
ington or an equivalent Hillbilly
haven all his life.

If the homey atmosphere is not
appealing in itself, there are always
Mr. and Mrs. Duck to make you
comfortable, Isn't that reassuring!
Mr. Duck is truly a friend to any
student who will dare walk through
his door. This man of the people is
always ready to go to bat for a stu-
dent.

In fact, he will do anything for a
patron (short of going into that

kitchen.) In any event, he is usually
there with a beaming smile, willing
and eager to sell somebody a keg
or a case,

Duck and his establishment's de-
cor are sufficient reason for a visit
to the Quid, but if you need more
convincing, consider the well planned
menu, Anything you might order
can be served to your booth in the
twinkling of an eye (and with a
minimum of effort to the staff.) The
service is all that you could hope
for—if you're ravenous, that is.

The best that can be said of the
Central Lunch cuisine is that it is
never monotonous, A Swiss cheese-

burger never tastes the same twice.
It is debatable as to wether the odds
are in your favor when you order,
but the food is always filling, just
like normal food, and occasionally
hot.

Perhaps the Quid’s greatest virtue
is to be found in its moderate prices.
One can comfortably enter its por-
tal with $1.50 and be assured of
dining as well as is possible there.
The steaks are among the cheapest
Lexington has to offer and afford
the best in incisor exercise.

One would be wise to avoid the
chili if the Quid has a rank odor.
Otherwise, one item listed on the

menu is as safe as the next.

All things considered the Quid is
a pretty safe bet when the pocket-
book allows such extravagance. A
cold brew and a smiling Duck as-
sure the visitor the kind of experi-
ence worth writing home about,

Before graduation each and every
student should make a_ point of
dropping in Central Lunch where
good home cooking (providing you
live in a place like Buena Vista) and
hospitality blend in a mixture which
reflects the old charm of Lexington.
Try it any night before twelve and
see what the good life in Lexington
is all about,

 

Duck and Mrs. Duck stand behind the familiar counter as reporter Reeves prepares to dive into a_ typical

“Quid” meal. The Central Lunch is located on Main Street.

Letters To The Editor...

On The Lexington Drug Scare

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Now that the long threatened
drug bust has finally come, | find
myself writing a letter I hoped |
would never write.

About two years ago we found
out that Lexington would be our
new home. We immediately began
receiving the local newspaper. Since
| was working in drug addict re-
habilitation in New Jersey, | was in-
terested in the news on drugs. The
impression | received was of a
community that for some unfathom-
able reason was trying to convince
myself it had a drug problem.

After our arrival this impression

DISCussion

was strengthened. | observed little
evidence of drug use and no evi-
dence of a drug problem. | feel that
a community has a drug problem
when drug users are committing
crimes under the influence of drugs
or to support their drug purchases,
or when medical problems result
from drug use (¢.g., hepatitis).

Yet everyone in the community
(outside the University, | should
add) seemed to be working them-
selves into hysteria over their “hor-
rible,” “severe,” “growing” drug
problem.

Why? I feel there are two basic
reasons: ignorance and fear. The

problem of ignorance about drugs is
overworked, I agree. Yet a local
pharmacy distributes a drug fact
sheet filled with what can most
charitably be called inaccuracies.

People make little or no differen-
tiation between marajuana and her-
oin. Marijuana is blamed for a large
variety of social ills, like school fai-
lure. When I was in school (not all
that long ago), smoking cigarettes
and drinking alcohol were blamed
for the same social ills. Smoking
cigarettes can give you cancer or
heart disease, alcohol ruins your
liver and marijuana has no proven
adverse effects, Yet only marajuana
is illegal.

When one points this out, one is
told that it’s against the law and,
therefore, it must be bad. Thus ig-

Grateful Dead
Warner Bros. 3WX 2668

The Dead are still on their way
up, and they're determined to take
us with them. This is the best music
they've made since the first Live
Dead. This 3-record set combines
the best of their loose, almost jazz-
like manner from that original live
album with the cosmic-country sound
they had been into since. The re-
cording is also excellent. No
screams, actually litthe applause. But
if | had heard them play this music
live, | wouldn't have been making
much noise, either, They're a hard
act to follow

The album abounds with excellent
cuts, such as a 13-minute version of
“Truckin which turns into an
open-ended “Epilog” that adds 44%
more minutes to the side. Well worth
it, Santana had the album
of the year, but this is definitely the

The people of Lexington have a
terrific fear of the drug pusher who
is going to seduce their children.
People cannot believe that the
“pusher” might well be their child's
best friend. For what it is worth, |
knew over 300 heroin addicts well
and every one had been introduced
to the drug by one of his good
friends. In addition, most heroin
addicts begin their addiction history
by abusing alcohol. We all know
how well the liquor laws are en-
forced in Lexington,

And so the big bust has come
and Lexington’s “terrible” drug prob-
lem turns out to be primarily mari-
juana and hashish. Laws against
these drugs are ignored by the au-
thorities in almost every college
community. To those students un-
fortunate enough to be arrested, I,
as a Lexington resident can only of-
fer an apology. I'm sorry your lives
are being disjointed and maybe ruin-
ed by this state’s unreasonable drug
laws. I'm sorry this community
wants your hides for something as
trivial as selling marijuana to an

Basketball Hopes Are High;
Look Toward U.Va. Saturday

By JIM MOZINGO

Washington and Lee opened up
the 1972-73 basketball season on a
winning note last night as the Gen-
erals nipped University of Pitts-
burgh at Johnstown, 64-61. Skip
Lichtfuss paced the winners with 17
points, while Guy Kerr added 12
and Paul McClure tallied 11,

The Generals will host Randolph-
Macon Thursday night, and will tra-
vel to Charlottesville Saturday to
take on powerful University of Vir-
ginia, Last year U.Va. was ranked
number seven in the nation.

Virginia will start a line-up that
may not be as tough as last years
due to the graduation of four of
last years best. Look for Virginia to
start the 6 ft. 4 in, Parkhill along
with 6 ft. 4 in. Jim Hobgood, 6 ft.
7 in. Dan Gerard, 6 ft. 10 in, Lanny
Stahurski, and 6 ft. 3 in. Andy
Boninti. This team has experience,
but you can expect some useless er-
rors that plague all teams this time
of the year, This could be fairly
close, but look for Virginia to try to
show off in their home opener.

The schedule is tough all season
long, and Coach Verne Canfield
purports to be working toward the
toughest small college schedule in
the country. So here is what W&L
faces the coming season with,

Coach Canfield expects to produce
another winning season, and he pro-
bably will if the team jells; if not
this could be a tough season. Odds
are they'll win more than they lose,
but to do so they must find a man
who can make the key play a la
Daniel, Cartwright, Neer, or they
must establish tremendous team
unity and coordination.

Hoping to fill this gap should be

Weekly Football Contest

returning lettermen Skip Lichtfuss
and Paul McClure. These two will
be looked toward for the leadership
this year. Liohtfuss was second to
Daniel in scoring last year and a
very close third to him in rebound-
ing. MeClure was third in scoring
and first in rebounding,

Both McClure and Lichtfuss should
get help from a promising 6 ft. 9
in, freshman, Norm Kristoff. Since
Lichtfuss moves across court to play
Daniel’s vacated forward, Guy Kerr
will fill Skip’s old forward spot.

Coach Canfield says this team
has the mobility and versatility to
do more on offense and defense
than any other W&L team since he
has been here. Canfield further says
that he can play a tall lineup with
McClure and Kristoff on the base-
line or he can play a faster de-
fensive lineup primarily replacing
Kristoff and going to a single post.
The student of the game can also
look for at least five defenses or
variations, though W&L is. still
basically a man-to-man team, Ex-
pect this team to run and run and
run... They've got experienced
guards in Hatton Smith, Doug Mlel-
lan, and Charlie Strain, and the men
to get it out in McClure and Kris-

The W&L Generals closed out
their season last Saturday in a man-

tire season. It was a game of ups
and downs for the Blue, but mostly
downs, as Washington turned on
the offense in the second half to
come from behind and grab a 27 to

toff, Also watch for Jerry Porath to
be a part of this combination in
some way.

The bench looks to be reasonably
strong with: Canfield declaring that
even the eleventh and twelfth man
are capable of spot duty. Part of
this bench are two freshmen, Gary
Fitzgerald and John Podgajny, in
addition to Kristoff, These three
you'll get to watch for four varsity
years, so. start recognizing them
now,

Other men to see action this year
should be guards Eugene Perry,
Mike Buchanan, forwards Bo Wil-
liams, and Greg Croghan, and
center Randy Taylor.

This years team should provide
W&L fans with an interesting sea-
son. Will a new talent such as
Daniel, etc. blossom? Will W&L be
able to get it together with so many
men playing new positions? Can the
newcomers fill the gaps that have
been created, as well as overcome
old shortcomings? For the answers
to these questions and many others
check out the 1972-73 W&L basket-
ball program. Maybe you'll get to
tell a friend how you used to make
the play in high school,

On the Saturday before Thanksgiving the varsity hoopers took on a
motley crew of alums, It was an exciting contest as the alumni included
former stars such as Mike Neer and Mike Danicl, The scrimmage prov-
ed to be a real test for the 1972 Generals, who edged their older
opponents 87-76, The season will be a tough one, and the Blue will
find out early.

 

Wrestlers Open;
Host M-Harvey

Washington and Lee University
embarks on an ambitious wrestling
program, beginning Wednesday
night when the Generals entertain
Morris Harvey.

The Generals under second-year
coach John Piper have momentum
from last year’s 6-6-1 record, the
first non-losing year in some time.
However, the improved team is off-
set somewhat by a toughened sche-
dule which includes eight University
Division opponents: Duke, Davidson,
North Carolina State, Virginia Mili-
tary, North Carolina, Furman, Vir-
ginia Commonwealth and Bucknell.

Seven lettermen form the nucleus
of the 22-man squad, led by Captain
Jim Stieff, a 150-pound junior from
Baltimore, Md, (Boys Latin). Stieff
was College Athletic Conference
champion at 142 as a freshman and
last year finished third in the CAC
at 150 pounds, posting an overall
7-4-1 mark,

Other top lettermen include 134-
pound Rolf Piranian of Oreland,
Pa. (Germantown Academy), the
CAC champ last year at 126 with
a 9-6 record; 142-pound Bill Mel-
ton of Virginia Beach (Kempsville),
the 134-pound CAC champ and
Outstanding W&L Wrestler as a
freshman; Doug Ford of East Islip,
N.Y. (East Islip) who posted a 10-4-
| mark, reigned as 177-pound CAC
champ last as a freshman and will
wrestle this year at 158. He was the
1971-72 “Outstanding Freshman
Wrestler,”

Three other returning veterans

Football Ends Long Year

(Continued from page 3)

the Washington 31, following a
blocked punt by Tim Haley, Van
Amburgh gained one up the middle
and then Fluharty passed incom-
plete to Baldwin. This brought up
a 3rd and 9. A Washington offsides
infraction moved the ball to the 25.
Fluharty then dropped back and hit
Conrad on a fly pattern for the
touchdown, Doug Chase’s extra
point was good, and the Generals
led 7-0. That was the extent of the
scoring in the first half. The Gen-
eral defense looked better than it
had all season, and consistently got
the ball for the offense. The Blue
just couldn’t score.

In the second half, the Blue lost
any momentum they might have
had, and practically got blown out
of the staduim. The defense that
looked so strong in the first half
must have gotten tired of giving the
ball to an offense that did nothing,
so they let Washington keep it for
most of the second half. And keep
it they did, as they scored 27 points
on four touchdowns, Two of the
scores came on long bombs that the
Blue secondary had found no trou-
ble in knocking down in the first
half.

Lewis Powell came in to run the
team for most of the second half,
but he also was unable to get the
offense clicking. The main problem
seemed to be the inability of the
Generals to manufacture any kind

of a ground attack. Van Amburgh
was unable to break through for
any sizable gains as he obviously
missed the blocking of counterpart
Jim Farrar, who did not even suit
up. Steve Fluharty had a disappoint-
ing performance in his last game in
a General uniform, He was unable
to move the team despite the many
opportunities offered in the first half
by the defense.

Tim Haley finished out his career
with a fine game as he intercepted a
pass, blocked a punt, and was in on
10 tackles. Marshall Washburn also
intercepted a pass in his final game.
Overall, the game was another dis-
appointment for W&L and can be
added to the list that has made it
a rather poor season. The best game
the Blue played was their first
against Westminster. After that they
never really showed improvement.
They ended with a 3-6 record, losing
their last three encounters.

In looking forward to next year,
a lot will depend on Lewis Powell,
the heir apparent to _ the
Fluharty throne. W&L must be able
to take advantage of breaks like
they received in the first half of
their last contest. Offensively, the
Blue seemed to have all the tools,
but lacked the spirit to blend them
into any kind of an offensive ma-
chine. That winning spirit could
have been the only thing that kept
the Blue from a winning season,
Maybe they can find it next year,

order to arrive on time.

Next, consider a special case—the
physician. It seems that the Pre-
Meds (of which I am one) at W&L
have the most A-hour classes, But
that’s only for starters, This summer
at the hospital, most doctors arriv-
ed before 7 a.m. to make rounds;
only to return at 6 p.m. to do the
same again.

One doctor in particular I no-
ticed, would spend till midnight at
the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) with
his dying patient, only to return
promptly at 6 a.m. the next morn-
ing to attend his patient.

My point here is, not necessarily
devotion or heroism, but that the
world starts early in the day and
one has to do the same to be part
of it. Consequently, one might as
well get in the habit now of getting
up with the world.

Two more aspects that Mr. Mar-
tin proposes need attention. First,
Mr. Martin states that “He (the
student) will get up as late as pos-
sible.”

True. That's human nature. Yet,
if all classes started at 9 a.m., stu-
dents would still be up at 8:45, com-
plaining that classes should start at
10 a.m.

Next, Mr. Martin suggests more
afternoon classes. People here al-
ready bitch about the fact that
weekends should start on Thurs-
day afternoon. Do you really be-
lieve that more afternoon classes on
Friday will draw more attentive
students?

EC Discusses
Final Exams

By JOHN ZINK

At their meeting Monday night
the Executive Committee discussed
the operation of the honor code
during the final exam period, EC
President Bob Brennan said that
any discussion of an exam during
the examination period will be con-
sidered as a possible honor viola-
tion, The statement issued by the
body emphasizes that the Indepen-
dent exam schedule “is a privilege
that is still on a temporary basis.
There's a simple way to insure that
this privilege becomes permanent—
Don't talk about exams.”

Junior representative Mike Brittin
announced that the Athletic Depart-
ment has created a laundry service
for students as part of the gym
facilities. The service is “for the
student’s benefit,” according to Brit-
tin and will cost each subscriber
$22. Anyone interested should con-
tact Coach Miller in Doremus.

Four dollars of the fee is a de-
posit for a laundry bag and will be
returned at the end of the year.
The charge is based on a maximum
of three launderings per week; Brit-
tin said only socks, jocks, towels,
shorts, T-shirts, etc. will be washed,
since sweats triple the drying time.

Clothing will be placed in the
student’s locker after laundering;
checks should be made payable to
the Washington and Lee Athletic
Department.

Suggestions regarding this service
are welcomed,

An envoy from the curriculum
committee, Steve Hilsen, reported
that his group was attempting to
get the faculty to provide more in-
formation on courses than is now
provided in the bulletin. Action is
also being taken to change the
“Pass/Fail” system so that a pro-
fessor would not know which stu-
dents in his class were taking the
P’F option; another reform would
enable students to add or drop the
pass/fail designation later on in the
term. As it now operates, a student
cannot make changes in his P/F
status beyond the first week of the
course,

The EC spent the remainder of
the session answering questions for
a field representative from the Bar-
ron’s Publishing Company, which
puts out a college guidebook.

U.C. Discusses The Arts

The University Council met last
Wednesday night with a report from
an ad hoe fine arts committee and
a discussion about housing for mar-
ried law students. The main issue
on the agenda, proposed autonomy
for the law school was postponed
until next’s month’s meeting.

Dr. George W. Ray, a professor
of English and head of the fine
arts study group, delivered a pre-
liminary report to the Council.
Since the last meeting, he said, the
group had conducted interviews
with Dr, Robert Stewart (Music),
Dr. Gerard Doyon (Art), and Mr.
Lee Kahn (Drama).

Ray said that their study showed
certain inequity in the area of fac-
ulty workload, with the three fine
arts departments coming in third,
fourth, and fifth in the number of
students taught per instructor, He
also read a series of passages
extracted from the 1966 self-study
report, which called for a replace-
ment for the Troubadour Theatre

and more laboratory space for
dramatics,

Professor Doyon said that the
space available to the art depart-
ment was “adequate but poorly
used.” He lamented the fact that

the university's art collection, valued
at some $3 million, was largely
stored in a bank vault; Doyon urged
that a place with suitable parking
facilities be located to display this

in the
Religion
Abroad. The
initiator of the six-
course is Dr, Minor Lee

Phe course will involve supervised
academic projects, lectures by vari-
ous authorities on the island country,
and field trips to cultural points
of interest in Japan.

Dr. Rogers expects an enrollment
of about nine students in the course.

According to the professor of re-
ligion, the group will be situated
during most of the Spring Term
either in Kyoto, the ancient capital
of Japan, or on the island of
Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's
four main islands.

Cost is the prohibitive factor for
the course, The estimated cost of
the course is $1500. Of this. says
Dr. Rogers, over $1000 goes to air
fare alone. The professor is cur-
rently investigating methods of re-
ducing air fare cost to the country.

The prerequisite for the course

course. He is, however, considering
the establishment of a non-credit
“seif-study” program in spoken
Japanese in the university language
lab. The program would allow stu-
dents in the course to learn funda-
mentals of the language at their
leisure before departing to Japan.

Dr. Rogers encourages students
of all majors to enroll in the course.
“The course can relate to other fields
such as drama, history, and busi-
ness. It's exciting to find such a
diversity of interests in a program
of this kind.”

Dr. Rogers lived in Japan for

four years. He studied at a uni-
versity there for two years and
served as a missionary for two
years. “The experience of living

there has given me a deep com-
mitment to getting people acquaint-
ed with such a different culture, The
experience of living there is the
kind of exposure to a culture that
raises a lot of questions.”

If the group locates itself in Kyoto
during the six weeks, students will
live with Japanese families at one
of three major universities located
in the ancient capital. Dr. Rogers
says that his alternative choice of

wealth of artifacts. He added that
the present duPont gallery was es-
sentially a “glorified hallway which
cannot guarantee security,” a fact
which deterred many fine art ex-
hibits from coming here.

Ray said that the situation with
music and drama was somewhat
more dire. The drama department
stated their needs as (1) a course
in basic scene design, (2) a theater
history course offered every year
(instead of every other year), (3) a
new man in directing with an
M.F.A., plus (4) one large class-
room.

Music needs were termed as
“critical.” Professor Stewart said
that he and his colleague in the
department were forced to cut down
listening assignments by 20% be-
cause of lack of facilities. He said
at least 250 records in the university
collection needed replacement and
that thievery of records and equip-
ment point up need for some kind
of monitoring system.

Stewart said they would like to
offer the Renaissance and Baroque
courses annually, more in theory
and composition, more in voice in-
struction, more instruments which
students could rent, and a new
faculty member in musicology and
voice.

Dr. Ray said his committee's
initial recommendations are:

(1) a space study of duPont Hall,
to make it a more efficient building.

(2) a home for the university's
art collection, perhaps in Col Alto.

In the other major topic of dis-
cussion, a student from the law
school presented the objections of
the SBA against the occupation of
four units in the Davidson Park
apartments complex by staff and
faculty.

President R. E. R. Huntley said
that no new faculty had been allow-
ed to move into Davidson Park for
the last several years and that most
of the holdovers have moved out
since.

The law student’s proposal was
that the two faculty members and
one staff member who presently live

Group Revives
Yuletide Service

The University Christmas Candle-
light Service used to be a regular
feature here in Lexington around
Christmas time. Given right before
the Christmas break at Washing-
ton and Lee, it combined a concert
of Christmas carols along with the
reading of the Christmas story by
W&L faculty.

When exams were switched to be-
fore Christmas in 1970, the schedule
prohibited a concert, since the last
few weeks were now to be spent
finishing up the semester and tak-
ing exams.

This year the University Federa-
tion is reviving the concert. It will
be held Wednesday, Dec. 6, at 8:00
p.m. in Robert E. Lee Memorial
Episcopal Church. It is open to the
public and is free. Collection plates
will be passed for donations. All
proceeds will go to the Childrens
Winter Clothing Drive.

According to Rick Anderson,
one of the co-ordinators of the pro-
gram, singing will be provided by
the Washington and Lee University

OUTLOOK andREVIEW!
The Universal Side of Education

‘The recent addition of two study abroad courses in Eng-
land and Japan, and the addition last year of a similar program
to East Africa, to Washington and Lee’s meager list of foreign
studies programs may be indicative of a growing change of at-
titude, not only among the hierarchial elements of this univer-
sity, but among Americans in general.

Granted, when Washington and Lee first switched to the
12-12-6 week semester plan in 1970, the idea of a foreign studies
program was probably deeply etched in the minds of propon-
ents of this switch.

We suspect, however, that these people were primarily con-
cerned with the initiation of an extensive foreign language
studies program. After all, what else is there to study in foreign
countries? Doesn't America offer enough educational opportuni-
ties for the individual? Besides a new language, what can a stu-
dent learn abroad that he can’t learn at home?

And, in accordance with this probable train of thought, the
first moves on campus in the area of foreign studies were made
by the foreign language departments. The German Department
responded with German 263, a supervised study in West Ger-
many constructed to give the student an insight into the culture
of the country. Of primary concern in the course, however, was
direct contact with the German language. Certainly the es-
tablishment of such a course was an anomaly to Washington
and Lee’s great tradition of not setting precedents, but it was a
calculated one.

The following year saw the establishment of courses in Spain
and France, both sponsored by the Department of Romance
Languages, and both structured in a manner remarkably simi-
lar to the course in West Germany.

The growth of W&L’s foreign studies program, then, was
developing as probably had been expected. ‘Three courses had
been established in two years, all in the language department.

But now, where was W&L heading in this field of foreign
studies?

The foreign studies program could have followed the course
of some other programs at W&L and reached a standstill in re-
guards to expansion. The situation was ideal. ‘The German,
French, and Spanish programs were all quite predictable. All
these languages offer majors at W&L, and their curricula were
fairly extensive.

But the same could not be said true for Greek, Russian, and
Italian. None of them offered majors in its own right, and none
was extensive, save perhaps for Greek. Study abroad courses in
these language departments were not feasible at all.

‘Thus, with nowhere eles to turn in the language area, W&L
could have stopped expansion of its foreign studies program al-
together. But it did not. Instead, last year, a study abroad pro-
gram sponsored by the Politics Department was approved, and
a course in East Africa was established,

With the establishment of this course in the W&L, curri-
culum, a precedent was set. No longer did the university look to
foreign study as a means only of studying language. A door was
opened to studying all of the components of civilization itself.
Politics, sociology, culture, religion, and many other curricula—
were now possible subjects in which foreign studies courses
could be established.

And so the East African course marked a beginning of a new
attitude at this university, that America is not the only source
of education. Foreign studies courses can direct us from this
American bias to a truer view of our world, And that is what
education is about: not just one side of the story, but all the

 

sides.

The courses to East Africa, England, and Japan, then, mark
a change of attitude both in this university and in’ America,
We hope that this attitude continues to change, and we hope
that the adjective “universal” may soon be substituted for
“American” in describing Washington and Lee's concept ol
education,

And when that happens, this institution will be a university
in a much truer sense of the word,

“It’s a sad, sad case. Our diagnosis shows that this turkey died from being overstuffed with shredded

examinations.”

By SKIP PAUKERT
Editor-in-Chief

These days, when student involve-
ment both in protest and in campus
affairs seems to be ebbing, many
student organizations and commit-
tees are struggling to staff their pro-
jects. We had a letter in these pages
not long ago, for example, from the
chairman of the University Center
Committee, lamenting the fact that
only one student among W&L’'s
1350 undergraduates was interest-
ed enough to apply for a position on
his committee.

What used to be a very prestigious
accomplishment, appointment to a
sub-committee of the EC, is now
largely ignored. Students are turning
inward, to their studies and to their
own off-campus routines, and that
great institution, the extra-curricu-
lar activity, is suffering.

That's why it’s refreshing to hear
of ene such group which is not suf-
fering for recruits and hard-work-
ing hard-thinking staffers. The Stu-
dent Curriculum Committee. which
hasn't been in the limelight since
the major curriculum changes were
made four years ago, is now push-
ing strongly for more reforms and
more changes.

Headed by Chairman Rick Marsh,
the committee has been running its
proposals up to Washington Hall
all year long. While their aggressive-
ness has sometimes forced the Dean
of the College into the position of
“devil's advocate,” still they're hope-
ful that they can leave their mark
with some hard and fast reforms.

Three of the major proposals
which have come out of the commilt-
tee’s weekly meetings this fall are
scheduled to be placed before the
Courses and Degrees Committee to-
day. The changes they hope to im-
plement are these

(1) To make it possible for a stu-
dent to take any elective course on
a pass/fail basis without the know!l-
edge of the professor. “Many stu-
dents believe that their professors
are failing them in a pass /fail course
if they get below a C,” said Marsh.
The committee believes. he said.
that all students, pass/fail or not,
should be graded on the same basis.

(2) To make it possible for a stu-
dent to drop the pass/fail status and
opt for a regular grade until mid-
term

(4) To increase student representa
tion on the Courses and Degrees
Committee. which now consists of
all faculty members except for one
student. “We think we need a direci
line to the Courses and Degrees
Committee, Marsh said

The biggest project they plan to
undertake, however, is the compila

tion, in booklet form, of course de

Curriculum

 

scriptions. The idea is to get each
faculty member to write a few para-
graphs on his course, revealing the
scope of the course and the amount
of reading and work involved.
Marsh says these course descrip-
tions would be “much more detail-
ed” than those found in the univer-
sity catalogue.

“We had originally hoped to pub-
lish a teacher and course evaluation
written by the students,” one com-
mittee member said. They abandon-
ed the idea when they were told that
it would be impossible to compile
an accurate survey. While at least
one member of Courses and De-
grees favored the project many
other faculty members were (un-
derstandably) quite opposed.

teacher evaluation by the Curricu-

Tebo’s Letter Attacked

My Most Venerable Sir:

| too am compelled to write in
response to this, oh so important,
issue of eight-o'clock classes. I re-
spond mainly to Mr. Tebo's response
to Mr. Martin's letter and why I
think it represents an imbalanced
and medically unsound philosophy
of life.

fo begin. Mr. Tebo seems to
think that having endured A-hour
classes somehow places him in a
position of martyr. To my mind,
by his Junior year, if an individual
hasn't been able cartily to schedule
himself around those A-hours, or
tse bribes and/or phone threats to
get them changed, he deserves no
sympathy.

Secondly, although it cans well,
“climbing out of the rack before the
sun does, even while the moon is
high in the sky. and encounter the
hitter-cold of winter” calls to mind
the gamey flavor of a Jack London
novel, or the check-out rules at the
Reykjavik Hilton during their long
winter season. Really, Virginia win-
ters arent that cold ask any
radar operator on the Dew Line

Fhe several paragraphs that fol
low are distressing. Mr. Tebo calls
us to be “realistic” and outlines not
so briefly the rigors of a work-a-day
schedule. The “freeway roller-coaster
jam-up” and the “45-minute-to-an
hour head-start™ fill us with a sense
of dread and impending doom, We
start fevently praying for a replay
of Kafkas “Metamorphosic’ in a
hope of somehow forestalling this

lum Committee

Other campuses, they said, who
had conducted more successful sur-
veys of the faculty utilized comput-
er forms from the Educational Test-
ing Service. But, said Marsh, the cost
for these materials was preclusive.
“We just can't afford 40-50c¢ per
page.”

Dean William J. Watt has heard
most of the proposals and thinks
some may possibly be feasible, pend-
ing discussion and approval by the
Courses and Degrees body. “My
own personal feeling,” he stated, “is
that curricular matters are matters
for faculty decision.” To relinquish

Mr. Tebo says, “Next consider a

Mr. Tebo. consider instead the de-
throned royalty-in-hiding. the gig-
golo, the glamourous movie-star
who sleep until noon and waltz till
dawn. They would laugh at A-hour,

no, not even laugh, they would
cackle!!
Your argument that “ihe world

starts early in the day and one has
to do the same to be part of it”
is faulty; ludicrous in fact, for the
world starts at different hours, Mr
febo. yes there are even times
zones that, by my watch, enable
Californians to start their day at
eleven o'clock in the morning!
Finally, your closing rhetorical
question, (calling to mind Socraies’
burning style in the “Apology™), is
somewhat Cyclopsian in scope. Why
bring up the question of afternoon
classes, a subject almost as distaste
ful as A-hour? Students will never
be attentive. Mr. Tebo. God bless
them for it, but they are the only
people who will be living after the
adults have died. Why not pamper
them a bit, what harm would there
be in having say . Classes in bed?

this power, he said, would be a
“reprehensible denial of the faculty's
responsibility.”

He said the stipulation which re-
quired a faculty member's knowl-
edge for a student to take a course
pass/fail was so that “no professor
would be forced” to take a student
on that basis.

Watt said he did not know
whether any professor had failed
P/F students with a “D” average;
“this certainly would be against the
consensus of the faculty.”

Some professors, the Dean added,

Some Tips On Where To Go

A Pre-Season Guide For The WEL Skiier

 

By SKIP PAUKERT

It's getting to be that time of
year again. Washington and Lee stu-
dents who survive the great exam
crunch will go home for Christmas,
and many of them will return in
January laden with new skis, boots,
and bindings.

We've witnessed a veritable ski
boom here at W&L; of course, there
have always been a few northern
interlopers, used to the snows of
Killington or Stowe, but they usu-
ally had to give up their sport for
their four years here. But now the
excitement over Southern skiing,
which began with the opening of
Beech Mountain in North Carolina
a few years back, is spreading
rapidly to Virginia.

There are a few more expert
skiiers at W&L, and a great many
more eager beginners each season.
fhe university now offers P.E. credit
for skiing at the Homestead; and
while reaction to this program has
been decidedly mixed, it certainly
has done a lot to introduce the
sport to brave schussers from Birm
ingham.

Once we return to campus after
Christmas the season will be in full
swing. Already Sugar Mountain in
North Carolina has announced that
they are open with a 4-inch base of
natural snow. Herewith, a capsule
rundown on the major areas within
reasonable driving distance.

By the way, if you want to get
out on the slopes one day, but it
looks warm and sunny in Lexington,
call and find out a report on snow
conditions anyway. All of these areas
have sophisticated snow-making
equipment, so they may have skiing
even when it looks impossible.

The following numbers can be
called toll free, by either dialing
direct or telling the operator on a
pay phone that the number is free.
Either 800-243-3520 or 800-243-
3521 will put you in touch with a
central office that can give you the

word on most of these Eastern areas.

Be wary, however; remember they
want to get you there, and some-

selves have a rental operation. And
it’s strongly recommended that you
start off the morning with a group
lesson; they’re reasonably cheap and
can save even the most intrepid
novices from some nasty injuries, as
well as getting you on the right
track with technique.

times can be a little less than ab-
solutely honest. If the lady says that
condilions at the Homestead, say,
are good to excellent, what she may
mean is that skiing on the Home-
stead’s kiddie slope is good to ex-
cellent. Be sure to ask which slopes
are open and what the conditions
are for each.

Vermont.” Well, being as how it’s
not really anywhere close to being
between Vail and Vermont, still it’s
the most exciting thing to happen
to skiing in the Virginia valley. Lo-
cated just outside of Harrisonburg,
it is brand new this year. Opened
by the Del Webb developers, Massa-
nutien will eventually have some $50
million poured into it to make it
a year-round resort.

This year it will boast four chair-
lifts and a J-bar, with 695 vertical
feet of slopes and trails (vertical
feet is, like it sounds, the vertical
altitude from the bottom of the low-
est slope to the top of the highest;
therefore, the higher the vertical,
the better), The people at Massa-
nutten are heading for a goal of 400
additional vertical and four more
chairs in the future. Prices will be
fairly steep (about $10 on week-
ends) but student rates will be avail-
able. To get there, take I-81 to
Harrisonburg, east on 33 to turn-
off at routes 644 and 646. Phone:
703-289-2711,

Of course, the most popular near-
by ski resort for W&L students has
always been The Homestead, Once
you accept the fact that the Home-
stead is really just a huge country
club with a couple slopes, it's not
that bad. This place generally ap-
peals to the more aristocratic among
us, (their hamburgers are the best
I've found at any ski area, and are
priced expectedly high).

But they have a good ski school
here, and the place is fine for begin-
ners. Just don’t go on weekends;
the crowds are incredible. As for
the more expert, I'm afraid you'd
be rather bored here; not a foot,
last year at least, of any interest-
ing moguls.

The Homestead also has this un-
believeably bad lift system (a trestle
car, they call it) which forces you
to keep taking off and putting back
on your skis with each ride. The
vertical is 500 feet. It’s located in
Hot Springs, Va., to the west. Phone

Just west of Lexington in a coun-
try home overlooking the Blue
Ridge resides W&L Professor Jim
Boatwright. The cottage serves as a
kind of retreat for the English pro-
fessor. It’s time to relax, read, and
compile new material for the Shen-
andoah, W&L’s literary quarterly.

The effort has certainly paid off,
for this fall the board of publishers
of Shenandoah has commended edi-
ior Boatwright for having directed

57-0 Romp

Washington and Lee University’s
wrestling team, fresh from a fourth-
place finish in a nine-team tourna-
ment last weekend, will return to
its home mat Wednesday night in
a double dual meet.

The Generals will host Lynchburg
College and Eastern Mennonite, be-
ginning at 7 p.m. in Doremus Gym-
nasium. Admission is free.

Coach John Piper's wrestlers are
1-0 in dual meets following a 57-0
victory over Morris Harvey last
week, The Generals then placed
fourth in the Lebanon Valley Invi-
tational over the weekend.

Individual standouts in the Le-
banon Valley meet were soph Doug
Ford, the runner-up at 167, and
three freshmen who all placed third:
Lee Keck at 118, Dan White at 126
and Jeff Kandle at unlimted.

W&L compiled 29% points to
finish fourth behind first-place Dela-
ware Valley 83, Swarthmore 71%
and host Lebanon Valley 40. Trail-
ing the Generals were Baptist Bible
29, Johns Hopkins 28, Messiah 26,
Ursinus 24 and Scranton 13.

In the Morris-Harvey match,
Goodman, Lewis and Powers all
had pins.

After this Wednesday's dual bout,
the Blue grapplers will take a month
long break. On January 10 they

Swimmers Capture Big Wins:
Future Prospects Look Good

By JIMMY BAIRD
and RICH KOCH

Washington and Lee’s defending
conference championship swimming
team has begun a tough twelve
meet schedule with victories over
powerful Old Dominion and Roa-
noke College. Yet to come are such
state powers as the University of
Virginia, William and Mary, and
Virginia Military Institute; the addi-
tion of Davidson, the University of
Richmond, and Seton Hall guaran-
tees that the season should be an
exciling one,

The team lost more fine swimmers
last year than ever before but the
Generals are confident of another
excellent year, Returning are five
conference champions: co-captains
Aven Sharp and Alan Corwith,
junior Steve Erickson, and sopho-
mores Will Brotherton and Jim
Howard, Lettermen Tom Young,
Jon Windle, and Lee Harriss are
also back.

Several top freshmen will help
fill the gaps caused by graduation.
Two Floridians, Rob Searles and
Bill Tiers, are already close to
school records. Bill Cogar is show-
ing his AAU State Championship
form and will be in contention for
All-American honors as a_ diver.
Other freshmen who will see action
are Gary Seldomridge, Alan Petti-
grew, Craig Graham, John Henzel,
Terry McCarley, and Mike Moore.
Breaststroker Richard Koch, diver
Dan Gold, and transfer students Bill
Garten and Steve Thienel round out
the squad,

Prospects for the year look good
with hope for another CAC champ-
ionship high, and perhaps a VCAA
state championship. Several swim-
mers have the potential to qualify
for the NCAA College Division Na-
tional Championship meet at Wayne
State University in Detroit.

The 69-43 win over Old Domin-
ion Saturday opened the home meet
schedule for the Generals. W&L
captured first places in ten of the
fourteen events, paced by diver Bill
Cogar who set school records in the
one-meter and the three-meter div-
ing events. For this effort Bill was
voted the meet’s outstanding per-
former by team members. VMI
swam against ODU concurrently

with W&L, and the Generals were
given a glimpse of a tough opponent
they themselves will face later in
the season.

On Monday the Blue traveled to
Roanoke College to overwhelm the
Maroons 62-31. W&L used this meet
to tune up their swimming per-
formances in anticipation of a diffi-
cult meet on Tuesday with Alle-
gheny College. The Roanoke Col-
lege squad, only in its second year
of existence, was simply no match

B-Ball Beats

 

By JIM MOZINGO

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team evened its record at 2-2
Monday night with a 92-83 win
over Lynchburg College in Doremus
gym. W&L’s two losses came at the
end of last week. They lost a tough
game to Randolph-Macon on Thurs-
day, and made a valiant effort
against Virginia, especially in the
first half, only to be overcome by
the Top 20 Cavaliers.

Last week W&L fans were treat-
ed to the varsity debuts of no less
than five new talents. Seeing signi-
ficant floor time were forwards Guy
Kerr, Gary Fitzgerald, Bo Williams,
Greg Crogham and center Norm
Kristoff. Especially impressive has
been the play of sophomore Kerr.
He kept W&L in the ball game
against Johnstown in the opener and
his floor play and shooting have been
good in all four games. Kristoff,
Fitzgerald, and Williams have seen
action in all four games, while
Croghan made his appearance in the
opener. These men in addition to
our four strong guards, Clelan,
Smith, Strain, and Porath, give the
Generals a strong and flexible
bench, which Coach Verne Can-
field has used well so far.

Statistics up through the Virginia
game show Doug Clelan leading the
team in assists with 18, followed by
Charlie Strain with 13, Paul Me-
Clure and Skip Litchfuss tied in
rebounding with 27 each, an aver-

for Washington and Lee talent as
the Generals swept all but two of
the events.

Following the Allegheny meet the
swim team breaks for exams and
Christmas vacation. A number of
the team members will spend the
holidays in Florida, participating in
the annual Ft. Lauderdale Swim-
ming Coaches Forum, The next
scheduled meet is with the Uni-
versity of Virginia at Charlottes-
ville on January 5th.

Lynchburg:

Take On Tigers Tonight

age of nine a game, and Lichtfuss
leading the team in scoring with an
average of 21.3 ppg. The Generals
are not shooting well yet this year.
They have compiled a 34.5% shoot-
ing percentage from the field, are
shooting an even 60% from the
foul line,

As we guessed last week, floor
play has been a bit sloppy, but a
reasonably young team this early
in the season its to be expected.
The Generals don’t yet seem to be
playing at peak potential. They put
on a stirring first half perform-
ance at Virginia in the game Satur-
day night, while doing their best
to give away the opener in the clos-
ing minutes to a reasonably inept
Johnstown team. W&L has to get
its cohesiveness together to make it
a winning season and to have a
chance to repeat as at least co-
holders of the CAC title. This is
a coming, team but will it get
here before it’s too late?

WAL plays tough Hampden-Syd-
ney away Wednesday night. The
ligers are led by Reid Kelly who is
averaging 24 ppg. This should be
a stern test for a W&L team which
is playing good defense, generally,
but is having trouble putting the ball
in the basket. So if you can't see
the Generals before the Invitational
here in January, or in Mobile at
the Holiday Tournament on Decem-
ber 29 and 30, you may not
recognize them.

“Biff Barf’s” Sports Spotlights

By PALMER TRICE

Washington and Lee has much to
be proud of in their 1972 sports

program. The Blue booters (who
don’t like to be called that because
it seems to imply that they kick
with their toes, and not with their
insteps, but will be called that any-
way) had an excellent season. Their
narrow 1-0 loss to Madison was the
only thing that stood between the
Blue and the NCAA tournament.
W&L soccer found a real spirit this
year, a winning one. For a change,
spectators lined the sidelines. It was
a good year for the booters. Next
year should be even better.
* OK *

Cross-country had its best year in

recent memory. The Blue were led

by the dedicated Stu Nibley, and
supported by a perfect mix of vet-
erans and frosh. The harriers car-
ried a 9-1 record in dual meets, won
the CAC, finished second in the state
meet, and participated in the NCAA
College Division Meet. As with
soccer, next year should be even
better, as most of the runners will
be coming back.
* * *

Certainly the football season as
a whole was disappointing, but it
had its highlights. Tom Van Am-
burgh averaged 91 yards a game,
and was the closest thing that W&L
has had to a real running threat in
a while. Van Amburgh was the only
General named to the first team on
the all-VCAA team. Second team

honors went to Steve Fluharty,
Chappy Conrad, Bob Brand, Don
Eavenson, and Marshall Washburn.
Mike Britten, Rick Kulp, Tim Haley,
Jim Farrar, and Ed Kowal gained
honorable mention. Conrad’s punt-
ing was the closest any General
came to stardom. For the year he
averaged 40.6 yards per punt,
Could he kick in the big leagues?
* - *

Last week new Lacrosse coach
Jack Emmer took off recruiting.
Emmer traveled to Baltimore, Phil-
adelphia, and then on to his old
hunting grounds on Long Island.
Prospects for this year’s team look
very good. Coach Emmer seems to
have developed a rapport with his

To the Editor

Yet these relics of antedeluvian
craftmanship, that the coaching staff
has the audacity to call Gymnastic
equipment, continue to blemish an
otherwise model gymnasium, A new
set of stillrings, parallel bars, a side-
horse, and a high bar is compara-
tively durable and inexpensive.

There is no excuse; no justification
for such a flagrant misdirection of
funds and miscarriage of priorities.
If this college cannot purchase
equipment that is safe and which,
at least, lends minimal credit to the
developments of the modern age let
us at least terminate the cause of
loathesome embarrassment and de-
spicableness by trading those emb-
lems of pre-industrialism that now
befoul the elegance of Doremus
gymanasium.

North Carolina Has Best Skiing

Last year, Beech, like Bryce, was
talking about closing to the public

more vertical feet than its neighbor,
with 1,000 ft. total. Between the
two, you can have some excellent

The vertical is 650 feet, and night
skiing (lighted) is offered. Phone:

Finally, for those of you too good
for all of this, a trip to Blue Knob
in Pennsylvania might be in order.
With some 1,000 vertical feet, Blue

Basketball season is here again.
Coach Canfield promises that he will
have “another winner.” The Gen-
erals this year will run more than
last, and play tough defense. They
should prove interesting. In his
efforts to make W&L basketball big
time, Coach Verne Canfield took his
Blue team to the very unfriendly
confines of University Hail in
Charlottesville. Due to a decision by
Virginia Athletic Director Gene
Corrigan, there were very few
tickets to be distributed on the W&L
campus. For those fifteen to twenty
W&L gentlemen who scalped their
way into the contest, it proved to
be just that. For nineteen minutes,
the lightly touted Blue stayed in the
game. They grabbed an early five
point lead, and managed to hold
onto the lead for almost nine

minutes of the game. Those of us
who managed to get in were more
than glad that we had,

Curriculum Committee
Proposes Reforms

(Continued from Page 2)
share this opinion.

Whether these curriculum com-
mittee proposals will eventually
translate into real results is yet to
be decided. At this stage, Marsh and
his committee members are going
ahead with consideration of several
new ideas.

First, the group is looking after
the needs of the fine arts depart-
ments. “The administration says we
won't know anything on this issue
until the end of the year,” says
Marsh. At this point they are push-
ing for an experimental theater and
an additional faculty member.

Secondly, they are exploring pos-
sible inequities between  depart-
ments, measuring the number of
teachers vs. the number of majors,
“We want to look into the Physics,
Math, Chemistry, and other depart-
ments, where student-faculty ratio
may be unjustly high.”

There has also been talk about
unlinking the linked courses in the
Commerce School, about providing
the option of dropping to nine hours
in the fall or winter term, with per-
mission of the instructor, and fin-
ally, about encouraging more inter-
departmental courses.

Several committee members are
also pushing for more student say-
so for the hiring and firing of pro-
fessors. “Everything we do has to
result from working through the de-
partments themselves,” Marsh states.
“That's just the way things work
around here.”

Dean Watt points out that on
most committees where student “in-
put” is fully represented, their opi-
nions are not necessarily different
from faculty members, On almost
any issue debated in the University
Council, the sides are not divided
on student-faculty lines.

Nevertheless, Marsh's committee
shows every sign of pushing for
more student involvement in aca-
demic affairs. If anyone can make
the headway, they seem to be the
ones.

made, Any student who is not im-
mediately reinstated may apply for
reinstatement only for a term be-
ginning after the passage of one
calendar year.

UC On Married Housing

by September 1, 1973.

UC representative Ralph Smith
said that he objected to the motion,
on the grounds that “these people
entered into a rental agreement in
good faith.

The motion was defeated unanim-
ously, President Huntley said that
the new married student housing
being constructed in the Liberty
Hall area would hopefully take some
of the pressure off this problem.
Present estimates indicate, according
to his assistant Frank Parsons, that
the new apartments will rent for
approximately $110 to $120 per

month plus all utilities except water,
Huntley said that the new units
would be “somewhat nicer” than
those in Davidson Park.

The next University Council meet-
ing will be held Thursday, January
4 at 7:30 p.m. in the EC room.

Vol. LXXII

Ralph H. Smith
Rhodes Scholar

By MIKE CHRISTOVICH

Last December 16 was a good day
for most Washington and Lee stu-
dents, as exams were finished and
most looked forward to a_ long
awaited two-week vacation over the
Christmas holidays. But no one was
happier than Ralph H. “Smitty”
Smith, as it was announced that
Saturday that he was a Rhodes
Scholar, W&L’s third in eight years.

Saturday’s announcement from
New Orleans culminated a_ three
month screening process in which
only thirty-two students from across
the nation are awarded the presti-
gious honor.

Begun in 1904, the Rhodes Schol-
arship Program was set up to unify
English speaking people throughout
the world through education, To-
day’s Rhodes Scholarship candidate
goes through an exhaustive three
stage screening process before only
a select few are finally chosen. This
process begins at the individual
schools where Rhodes Scholarship
committees are set up to determine
which students are qualified for the
award.

At Washington and Lee, Profes-
sors William Jenks, Ramsey Martin,
and Sidney Coulling of the History
Philosophy, and English departments
respectively, make up the Rhodes
selection committee. This year they
received five applications for the
scholarship, but only Smith surviv-
ed the entire screening process,
After interviews at the individual
schools, applications are sent to the
candidate’s home state, where his
record is reviewed and sometimes
eliminated by a state’s Rhodes com-
mittee. However, in Mr, Smith's
case he was chosen with twelve other

Alabamans to compete in Rhodes
competition in Birmingham, Ala-
bama.

Each candidate is interviewed for
about forty minutes by the state
committee and only two are chosen
to advance farther in the scholar-
ship competition. In the interviews
the candidates’ strengths and weak-
nesses are tested by an assortment
of general, but complex questions
posed to them by the Rhodes com-
mittee.

After the state competition, only
Smith and one other Alabaman were
selected for the final district com-
petition in New Orleans. Pitted
against eleven other candidates from
the Gulf States region, Smith sur-
vived the final elimination process
and became the tenth person from
Washington and Lee to win the
scholarship.

Each candidate is allowed three
choices from the twenty-five-college
Oxford University system. Smith
hopes to be placed at either Christ
Church College, St. John's College,
and Corpus Christi College. He
plans to study philosophy, politics,
and economics during his two years
there, in preparation for attending
law school in the United States.

‘Streetcar’ Cast
Is Announced

By DOUG BURTON

It was time, Drama _ professor
Lee Kahn thought, for this Univer-
sity in the South to pay tribute to
the South's greatest dramatist, The
cast for Tennessee William's “A
Streetcar Named Desire” is final,
wnd Kahn is glad the ordeal is over,
At least 47 men and 1S women
iried out for parts during open au-
ditions last week, Kahn's conclusion:
I've got a very strong cast overall.”

Kahn chief hurdle is
overcoming the Brando mystique
hanging in the air ever since Mar-
lon’s memorable 1947 portrayal of
the protagonist, Stanley Kowalski
Scott Rieger, as Stanley, will should
er that burden

Like most of the cast, Rieger is
u veteran player, having appeared
before in “Billy Budd", “The Lower
Depths,” and Macbeth”. Rieger's
Stanley, Kahn said, “will be quieter,
leeper than we usually see him.”

The set being built by O. K
Barnes features a semi-romantic,
vintage 1950 shot of New Orleans
While Rieger makes an end run
around the ghost of Brando, Kahn
will be hard pressed to keep the nos
talgia from blanketing William's
powerfully drawn characters

“It's going to be a terrific prob
lem for us because we have to do
Streetcar as if it were a period piece
lo do it realistically and still give as
1 sav the flavor of the South.”

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, JANUARY 10, 1973

or Corpus Christi.

The EC Monday night passed a
resolution to place class officers on
the Student Control Committee,
abolishing the current method of
appointing committee members.

The evening's debate centered
around a proposal by Bob Brennan
to reorganize the SCC by placing
class officers automatically on the
committee. Many members express-
ed the belief that by doing so, the
quality of the officers would be im-
mediately improved. Bill Merrill,
EC vice president, proposed that
the officers not be automatically
placed on the SCC, but that the
EC urge them to seek a position on
the committee once elected. Mer-
rill said, “There is not a cause and
effect relationship in this matter.”
Merrill suggested that the Brennan
proposal might further weaken the
integrity of the SCC.

Jim Overton, speaking for the pro-
posal, said that he supported the ac-
tion on the grounds that, “since
these people (class officers) are elect-
ed they should be given something
to do.” Another proponent of the
proposal Archer Frierson, suggested
that by automatically placing class
officers on the SCC, the EC would

UC Debates Law School
Situation And Recruitment

The issue of the relationship be-
tween the law school and the under-
graduate school made its way into
the agenda of the University Coun-
cil in a meeting held Thursday.

Also discussed at the meeting was
the problem of recruiting blacks at
WAL. The group discussed the prob-
lem and possible methods of rele-
gating the problem.

The law _ school-undergraduate
school relationship issue, which has
been “blown all out of proportion”
according to EC President Bob
Brennan, was discussed without reso-
lution officially recognizing the
“problem” or offering a concrete
solution to it. The 24 hour session
proved to be more of a sounding
board than anything else, which was
the essential idea of the discussion.
Ideas brought up at the meeting
were assimilated by Jeff Twardy,
head of an EC-appointed commit-
tee studying the relationship be-
tween the two schools, for considera-
tion within that committee.

An effective orientation program
for first year law students was the
major idea brought up at the meet-
ing. The program directed primar-
ily towards law students from col-
leges other than WA&L, would pri-
marily be organized to “relate” the
law students more to the university
as a whole, as it is dominated by
the undergraduate school,

Twardy explained what he saw as
the thoughts of many, if not most,
law students regarding their rela-
tionship to the undergraduate school,
“It is the feeling of many law stu-
dents that they are separate and
apart from the school as a whole

and (most of these students)
desire to remain separate and apart.”
Differences in age and courses of
study between the two student bodies
were cited as prime forces which
separate the two,

ing. Twardy noted that the law
school “is accelerating at a greater
speed than the undergraduate
school,” forming a widening schism
in that sense, Also, the completion
of the new law school was seen as
a force in the future which will sep-
arate the two schools further.

The suggestion of an extensive
orientation program for first year
law students was made by law school
UC member Ted Ritter. He said
the program could possibly “fill law
students in on what's available” on
the W&L campus. He also said the
program could give the law students

the class offices were basically social

Commonwealth's Attorney Eric
Lee Sisler said that the key to the
prosecution will be the testimony of
four state undercover policemen,
officers T. S. Savard, W. B. Taylor,

The four troopers worked in the
Lexingion area for more than a year
as part of a valley-wide investiga-
tion. Sisler gave no indication thai
the prosecution would summon stu-
dent witnesses.

The University administration has
not committed itself on the question
of disciplinary action. The Student
Control Committee, made up en-

tirely of students, will have original
jurisdiction on the matter but can-
not begin an investigation until after
the trials. The committee's actions
are subject to review by the Student
Affairs Committee, made up of stu-
dents and faculty.

OUTLOOK and REVIEW!
A New Job For Class Officers

While Richard Nixon grapples with a disgruntled Congress
over his governmental reorganization plans, W&L’s own stu-
dent body president doesn’t seem to have the same problems.
sob Brennan and his fellow Executive Committeemen this
week pulled their greatest coup since getting a student repre-
sentative into the Board of Trustees’ meetings—they actually
found something for class officers to do,

Starting next year the members of the Student Control Com-
mittee will be, for the first time, elected by the student body.
The committee responsible for all student disciplinary matters
short of honor violation cases will consist of the following: the
president and all three vice-presidents of the Senior class, the
president and vice-president of the three undergraduate classes,
plus the president and vice-president of the Student Bar As-
The Student Control Committee,
therefore, will retain its number of twelve—with the distinct
difference of being a representative, rather than a select group.

Several reasons come to mind for such a consolidation, First,

sociation of the Law School.

it gives those forlorn class officers some responsible function to
keep them off the streets. Second, it protects the Student Con-
trol Committee from a clear and steady drop-off in the number
of students applying each year for EC subcommittee posts.
Now, as long as we have class officers, we'll have somebody to
keep us all in line.

Whether this change will work for the better, we just don't
know—but it seems to be worth the try. Certainly it’s a fact that
the Student Control Committee has been decidedly less active
this year than in the past. Just why is this so? Either (a) this
year's students are, on the whole, considerably more angelic
than usual (highly doubtful, wouldn't you say?) or (b) the Stu-
dent Control Committee is for some reason not able to do its job
effectively. Members of this year's committee have claimed that
they have not felt comfortable prosecuting student misbehavior
precisely because they were appointed, not elected, officials.
Hence, the reason for the change.

Just let's be careful about who we are electing as class presi-
dents from now on. That guy who's planning your grain party
may also be heading up your inquisition.

N.E.P.

On The Recruitment Program

Now is the time, after four years of success and frustration,
to take stock of the university's efforts to recruit underprivi-
ledged students. And first, let us make it clear, we are talking
primarily about black recruitment, for black men have made up
the bulk of this group.

There is a lot of dissatisfaction going around concerning
the plight of the black students who are here now and the fact
that dwindling numbers of black students have been enrolled
each year. This dismay was brought into focus during last
week's University Council Meeting, during which Dean of Ad-
missions James Farrar gave the figures which tell the story.

The recruitment effort reached its zenith in September of
1970, when, out of 36 blacks applying, 24 were accepted, and 15
were enrolled, The following year, about the same number ap-
plied, 19 were accepted, but only four enrolled. In September
of this year, another 29 applied, 16 were accepted, and only three
came,

How can this decline in numbers enrolled be explained?
Johnny Morrison, a junior representing the Student Associa-
tion for Black Unity, blamed the failure on a “lack of knowledge
and experience” in the recruiting program. But if the Student
Recruiting Committee can be faulted at all, it is not for their
lack of industry. They have proved themselves to be one of the
hardest-working groups on this campus,

The big reason W&L is not getting these black students ts,
of course, the competition we receive from other colleges and
universities. Contrary to widespread opinion, admissions stand-
ards have not been arbitrarily lowered for black and underprivi-
ledged applicants. True, SAT board scores are, on the average,
some 100-110 points lower for the recruited students. But the
admissions committee has held to these standardized
tests as a rigid indicator, either for whites or blacks; Dean
Farrar steadfastly maintains that black students are accepted
1 e., their ability to do the work

never

on the same criterion as others, 1
at Washington and Lee,
Naturally, those black students who can do the work here
are going to be courted by the Ivy League and other prestigi-
ous institutions. And this is where W&L has been losing out.
Two suggestions have come out of recent discussion on this
inane. One is that W&L should embark on a remedial five-or-six-
vear program, which would allow us to take underprivileged
students with whom we would not face stiff competition from

schools it has been proposed that a man be

hired to work in the admissions office solely for recruitment of
underprivileged students,

We object to both of these proposals The first be, in essence,
lowering standards to fill a racial quota, a course which has led
to nothing but alienation and ill feelings on other campuses.
The second idea is undesirable, not only from the standpoint of
having an admissions man catering solely to one group, but
also from the standpoint of cost. Money to pay his salary would
he money taken away from scholarships.

There are things about W&L which should attract the black

student, just as they attract the The location and size,

Some Impressions On Returning

To The W&L Country Club

By J. JASON MATTHEWS
Now that we've all returned to
our beloved campus, its austere col-
umnar counterance changed by a
downy mantle of snow, it is both
reasonable and practical to prepare
ourselves, Ahead lies our 12-week
Winter Term and only after Christ-
mas vacation do we truly know how
Napoleon felt on the eve of his re-
treat from Russia, This term, some-
times rumored to have come straight
from the manuals of the Marquis
de Sade, is a long, desolate era in
our school year not once punctu-
ated by holidays or good weather.
Sure, sure the heady excitement
of new teachers and courses is there
at first, but after the first twelve
minutes of class, that quickly dies
away, There is always the chance
of finding the perfect date some
weekend, but there is a better chance
you'll go flaming into oblivion as
your auto careens down some icy
ravine on the way to Lynchburg.
To make the whole bleak term
pass more quickly and less painfully
we have prepared a few notes in the
hope that it will somehow ease
someone's pain somewhere.

State of Mind

This is in itself a truly pivotal
point in maintaining one’s sanity
during the Winter Term. If one does
not have a firm control on his mind
and the oh so zany tricks it can
play, count yourself lost, True, there
is a camp which believes in salva-
tion through disorientation and
which has experimented with sev-
eral methods.

Unfortunately, peyote is not in-
digenous to the Valley, and wear-
ing a gas mask filled with Boone's

Farm Strawberry Hill is not in ac-
cordance with accepted levels of
social behavior. Disorientation, al-
though not bad in itself, is not the
answer here. Salvation is found in
increased lucidity of one’s plight;
the more we understand what the
hell we've gotten ourselves into, the
better we'll be able to cope with it.

A close reading of the major
philosophers who have dealt with
the issue of man’s plight is avail-
able. One a week, in alphbetical
order will do the trick. Starting
with Camus and going through the
Hardy Boys to Pascal will give the
student some idea as to the univer-
sality of his dilemma.

| propose weekly sensitivity ses-
sions, available to everyone who so
desires, whose techniques would in-
clude bunsen burner tactile aware-
ness, an Evans Dining Hall food
whirlpool bath, and a_ three-day
“remedy” sequestration in the cup-
ola above Washington Hall tied to
the bell clapper. In any case, cogni-
zance is the key word here, a goal
for which everyone should strive.

Student Activities

The mug-wumps and stick-in-the-
muds of DUBYANEL many times
indict our fair alma-mater with ac-
custations that it offers little or
nothing to do, student activity wise.
Oh foolish youth! Not true! At al-
most any point around campus an
energetic student can find diversion
and amusement.

This year Mock Convention video-
tape replays are being made avail-
able and a pre-season § screening
promises many stirring montages of
ballons and those cunning straw con-
vention hats, Spelunking forays will

Farrar has said, our best bet to convinee a black student to come

here is to show him the campus and introduce him to students.
Herein lies our greatest selling point,

The EC must keep this in mind as

they consider the Re-

cruitment Committee's proposal for an allocation to provide a

Emmer (who will be assisted by
Bill McHenry) sees his job as coach
as helping every member of the

will enhance the team picture, He
will also “make every member of the
team feel they're contributing, be-

Emmet this view is funda-

Blue lost its first game 82-74 to a
talented Nichols State squad. How-
ever they defeated the host team,
Spring Hill, the next night by a not
so convincing 69-60 score.

The Nichols State team contained
some high classed talent that this
reporter saw in high school, but
were not as impressive as they might
have been, even though freshman
Richard Polk shot the eyes out of it
that night. Polk was a high school
star for three years on an excellent
high school squad that was state
tournament caliber, Polk was voted
to numerous all-tournament teams
his last two years in high school.
His biggest problem seems to be at-
titude and a bad case of underdeve-
loped talent. W&L was rusty coming
off its Christmas lay-over, Timing
was bad or the game might have
been a different story as neither team
played to its potential. The Gen-
erals had been favored by many
local people in the tournament to
whom W&L was an unknown quant-
ity.

The second game against Spring
Hill was a different story. Though
Spring Hill put up a good game,
and the Generals were again unim-
pressive. Spring Hill was definitely
outclassed. At times the game re-
minded me of run-and-shoot free-
for-alls I used to play in at the local
playground, but W&L managed to
control enough of the ballgame, and
steal enough of Spring Hill's errant
passes to counteract their own,

Washington and Lee returned to
Doremus this past Friday and Sat-
urday nights to host its own tourna-
ment. Lebanon Valley defeated
Maryville College and Washington
and Lee defeated Washington Col-
lege to open the tourney on Friday
night, setting up one of the most
exciting finishes New Doremus has
yet seen, between W&L and Leban-
on Valley. The Friday game saw
Gary Fitzgerald come off the bench

a

 

for the first time that weekend to
do it all and spark the Generals to
their opening round victory. But no
individual performance could over-
shadow the Championship game Sat-
urday night with its forty-three min-
utes of enthusiasm. (The last two
minutes, roughly, of overtime were
pretty academic.) The game began
as the scoring did, kinda slow. The
Generals drew first blood when Guy
Kerr connected on a free throw.
For the rest of the game it was nip
and tuck with neither team able to
gain any sizable advantage.

Paul McClure was beginning to
put together his best game of the
season to date as the game wore
on, Paul was not only rebounding
better, playing good tough defense
on a man taller than himself, but his
shooting was the best this year.
Team captain McClure held his team
in contention until he succumbed to
his fifth foul in the last two minutes
of the ball game. Hatton Smith, with
a fine defensive performance, and
Bo Williams, and again Gary Fitz-
gerald came off the bench to lend a
needed hand at some crucial mom-
ents, With W&L on the short end of
the score, and McClure having
fouled out Fitzgerald took a perfect
inbounds pass and scored the bucket
that tied the ballgame. The only un-
usual part of the play was that it
was a Lebanon Valley player who
got the assist. Despite urging from
the crowd the Generals refused to
give the, basket back to Lebanon
Valley and the game remained tied.
There was an exchange of baskets
and the game proceeded into a five
minute overtime, of which the first
three minutes were as tension packed
as the last three of the game.

All of a sudden a 6°3” whirling
mass of basketball talent took the
game by the throat and wrung all
emotion, unless it be sympathy,
from the rest of the game. None of
us who were there will forget the

performance turned in by senior co-
captain Donny Johnson, the man
who purportedly does a 36” stand-
ing jump. Johnson stole a pass with
the score tied, raced the length of
the court, and put the Lebanon Val-
ley crew ahead for the first time in
the overtime period. That was as
close as W&L came after that with
Johnson only needing his teammates
to remain alive for the rest of the
game, which they did a fine job of.
Johnson quietly scored 30 points and
led his team to an 82-79 victory
which left everyone in Doremus
drained. The guy was a one man
army.

As a postscript, Paul McClure is
awarded this week’s Academy
Award for his performance when
elbowed in the eye by Lebanon Val-
ley center Bill Ammons; a tremen-
dous job Paul, These two tourna-
ments noticably lacked freshman
center Norm Kristoff who tore liga-
ments in his ankle just before Christ-

mas. Nobody is quite sure when
Kristoff will be able to return to
action,

In his absence and not necessarily
because of it, another freshman,
Gary Fitzgerald, has become the
most dependable reserve on Coach
Verne Canfield’s front line. The holi-
days may have hurt W&L, especi-
ally because the new players were
just getting their timing down when
the break began, but since that
break meant the absence from books
for a few all too short weeks, Christ-
mas can't be all that bad.

Monday night; the Generals tra-
veled to Bridgewater and came away
with an 80-75 victory. It was one of
W&L’s best games, as they finally
combined their tough defense with
a poised and efficient offense. Coach
Canfield started Bo Williams and
Jerry Porath at the guards, in an
effort to spark his team. They ap-
parently did. With the help of sopho-
more Guy Kerr, they lead the team
to an early 8-0 lead. Coach Canfield
was pleased with the play of his
guards, including Doug Clelan. as
Williams had 12 points, and Clelan
and Porath both had 6. With this
win behind them, the Generals will
look toward Towson State tonight.

Interview With Coach Emmer

(Continued from page 3)
will stress is that “no one is to em-
barrass the team” in any way.

When questioned about how he
liked the University, Coach Emmer
had nothing but praise. He stated
that he was impressed by the hospi-
tality shown to him and his wife
throughout the University and went
on to say he has “had no second
thoughts on the move.”

Emmer said he was disturbed by
Cortland’s philosophy of rewarding
credentials rather than good teach-
ing and doesn’t feel that this is the
case at W&L. He said that he was

pleased to be at Washington and
Lee where, he says, the athletic sup-
port of many of the deans is “tre-
mendous.” He said he felt sure that
this was a good sign of spectator
support and that he was looking
forward to large crowds in the
spring.

Coach Emmer went on to say that
he can concentrate on coaching
more here, but that he still enjoys
getting out and working with guys
in phys. ed, classes. He asserted that
he isn’t the type that can sit in an
office all day and, with Washington
and Lee’s non-major phys. ed. pro-
gram and excellent facilities, he
doesn't mind teaching classes at all.

Many of the players have been
optimistic about Coach Emmer and
although there is a general con-
census that rules will be more lax
off the field, practices will be tough-
er than last year,

All-American defenseman and tri-
captain Don Eavenson felt that
Emmer has already built up a “good
rapport” with the players. He also
thinks that Coach Emmer will stress
conditioning more than ever and
that he will make sure that the
squad stays in top shape all season.
Eavenson summed up his feelings on
the coming season by stating that he
thinks Washington and Lee has
“more talent on paper than ever be-
fore” and that Coach Emmer has
brought “a whole new outlook” to
WA&L lacrosse which will insure its
continued success,

(Continued from Page 2)

So if love of murder mysteries is
typically American, I'm a Yankee
Doodle Dandy. And that’s why I
liked the new James Garner flick,
They Only Kill Their Masters,
which arrives at the Lyric Theatre
this week.

They Only Kill Their Masters
is by no means a great film. There
are no innovative camera angles,
no award-winning performances, no
memorable lines (except for a cut-
esy and constant repetition of the
word “neat” by the two principals),

You might even say the film was
Hollywood slick. Which is simply
another way of saying that this is an
unpretentious, thoroughly enjoyable
effort and an example of just what
the American motion picture in-
dustry does best.

They Only Kill Their Masters is
indeed a formula “whodunit.”
James Garner stars as the chief cop
in a small California town, a kind of
souped-up Mayberry R.F.D.—quiet
and shady, but close enough ‘to L.A.
to get all the wiredos passing
through.

The title refers to one Doberman
Pincher named Murphy who, in the
films opening scene, drags ashore
the mutilated body of his master, a
gir! who owned a secluded beach-
houses outside of town,

Immediately the dog is assumed
to have eaten the victim and is im-
pounded in the care of the local
vet (played by Hall Holbrook) and
his assistant (Katherine Ross).

Katherine Ross has very little to
do in the movie except fall in love
with James Garner. But one tremen-
dous virtue of this film is that she’s

out” quickly. He blamed this on a
“lack of knowledge and experience
in recruiting” on behalf of the uni-
versity, and proposed that the ad-
missions department of Washington
and Lee add a black recruiter to its
staff.

Dean James Farrar of admissions
presented facts involving black re-
cruitment to the UC. According to
the Dean, the facts showed that the
basic problem in recruiting blacks
lies in getting the black student here

Philip Booth To Sing

Bass soloist Philip Booth, a 1964
graduate of Washington and Lee,
will return to Lexington next Tues-
day in a Rockbridge Concert-
Theatre Series production.

Booth will perform in Jackson
Memorial Hall at VMI beginning at
8:15 p.m. Included in his program
will be works of Handel, Tchaikov-
sky, and American composer Ned
Roman.

The bass soloist has been singing
professionally for three years. He
has won several major awards in-
cluding a Metropolitan Opera Au-
ditions award and a grant from the
National Opera Institute.

Booth has performed with the
Western Opera Theatre, the Port-
land Opera, San Francisco's Spring
Opera Theatre, and the Baltimore
City Operas. He was also chosen to
perform in the opening _ perfor-

mances in the Kennedy Center of
Handel's Ariodante,

on camera almost as much as he is
—aand she’s still, needless to say,
captivating.

The mystery begins when we find
out that, lo and behold, poor Mur-
phy is not the criminal, but rather
that the young lady was drowned in
her own bathtub by someone very
human. Upon learning this, Sheriff
Garner adopts the dog, along with
Miss Ross, and proceeds to find the
real killer,

To tell more would be, as they
say, spoiling the fun. Suffice it to
say that, during the course of the
last ninety minutes, suspects are in-
terrogated, the inevitable second
murder is committed, and a whole
array of stars contribute some very
creditable performances. Tom Ewell
(talk about faces from the past!)
sits in the courthouse as Garner's
«.dekick, Arthur O’Connell runs the
local greasy spoon joint, and Ed-
mond O'Brien operates the local
liquor store (and looks like he’s
sampled everything twice).

Peter Lawford is his old smooth
self as he zooms down in his sports
car to look into his ex-wife's mur-
der; Holbrook intermittently appears
looking very suspicious; and June
Allyson plays a part in what must
be her first film in a long time.

All of which adds up to a really
exciting and eminently watchable
film, helped along by Lane Slate’s
taut screenplay and careful direction
by James Goldstone. Greatest of all,
the evil-doer is not revealed until the
very end (although any self-respect-
ing sleuth should have it figured out
by then, if he watches closely). For
a fun and diverting evening, They
Only Kill Their Masters is first-rate.

OUTLOOK and REVIEW!
Shutting Out The Students

Whenever anyone begins to enumerate those special virtues
which makes Washington and Lee a distinctive place to learn,
at least two (in addition to the Honor System) are sure to be
mentioned. One is the mutual respect and closeness between
faculty members and their students. The second is the ex-
tensive power granted to students in governing their own
affairs,

And, indeed, this power has become more and more ex-
tensive over the last few years. Nearly every faculty subcom-
mittee has managed to add student representatives. The Uni-
versity Council, cumbersome but still pretty effective with its
twelve faculty members and twelve students, has been created
to handle issues of student concern.

Still there are two realms of decision-making which have
heen traditionally closed to the students’ view. Overall uni-
versity policy, of course, continues to rest with the Board
of Trustees. And now, thanks to the cooperative efforts of
some EC members and some Board members, the Trustees’
vital deliberations will be open to the student body president.
A\ student ear and voice will be directly available.

In the second realm, however, students are still shut out
entirely. Now it has been said that students really woud be
bored stiff if they knew what went on at the monthly general
faculty meetings. Yet the faculty retains a great deal of
power—in fact, sole power over all important academic
matters.

We can think of many issues which are discussed in these
meetings—e.g., independent exams, or new courses, or grad-
ing policy—which students should be aware of. How the
faculty arrives at its decisions should be a matter of open
concern.

Under the present arrangement, if a student wants to
address the faculty or bring some matter to its attention, he
may be invited to do so. The student body president, for
instance, may come to a faculty session, say what he has to
say, and then leave immediately.

Why shouldn't the head of the student government be
permitted to observe the proceedings? For that matter, we
believe the meetings should be opened up to the student media,
as well, so that the student body can be aware of how the
faculty stands on issues of university-wide interest,

Certainly this is not a very radical proposal. Many
other universities and colleges have students actually voting
on academic issues. For these meetings to be shrouded in total
secrecy seems somewhat unnecessary.

Of course, we anticipate the arguments against allowing
students to view faculty proceedings. Discussion, they will
say, would be terribly inhibited if a faculty member knows a
student is watching and listening to what he says. And see-
ondly, think of the possibility of a professor being embarrassed
hy a stand he takes or something he says.

" But do these arguments really justify shutting students
out? We toot our horns constantly about the honesty and trust
hetween faculty and students—why then should a faculty
member be inhibited from saying something in front of a
student that he would freely say before a fellow faculty
member ?

As of now, rumors fly after each faculty meeting con-
cerning who said what and what went on, On the other hand,
each meeting of the Executive Committee and the University
Council is fully reported and open to public view ; why should
a faculty meeting be afforded insulation and protection from
the same kind of serutiny ?

In the current issue of the Washington and Lee bulletin,
President Huntley is quoted as summarizing the university in
this wavy—as an institution which “confidently entrusts the
largest possible measure of choice and freedom to its students
and its faculty, requiring conformity of no one (in an environ-
ment of) tolerance, integrity, and respect for others,

Let's make certain that we're fully living up to this ideal
N.E.P.

Letters To The Editor...

Steel vs. Matthews

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

I wish to direct a few remarks to
Mr. Jason Matthew's piece in last
week's Phi, “Some Impressions On
Returning To W&L Country Club, .”

In that article, you will remember,
Matthews relates his emotions on
returning to W&L after Christmas
break and offers some allegedly
humourous suggestions on how to
alleviate the boredom and alienation
which he feels are the inevitable
product of return. He suggests a

Black Focus

A Tribute

In Honor of the Birthday of
Dr. Martin Luther King

By JOHNNY E, MORRISON

“No man is an island, entire of
itself.” No words can be so appro-
priate to carry the philosophical
concepts of Martin L. King than
the ones found in John Donne's
“For Whom The Bells Toll.”

Martin L. King’s life was depicted
as one of trials, moments of joy,
deliberation, quick decision making,
love and hatred. Monday was a
day set aside by Black people to
pay special tribute to a man con-
sidered to be one of the Black
Messiahs of Black people. The Stu-
dent Association for Black Unity
would like to take time to pay
tribute to a true Black leader who in
his own way, did his part for what
we think of “the cause.”

Brother Martin was a man who
was born into a world which was
(and still is, in a covert manner)
infested with hatred, racism, and
egotistical drives. The superiority
complex found its haven in the
minds of many whites while the
damaging factors of the inferiority
complex became a psychological
stigma on the minds of Blacks,
We believe the most important con-
tribution that brother King gave
to not only the Black but people
all over the world was his untiring
efforts to challenge customs and tra
ditions,

He showed us (both black and
white) that all men are equal in
the eyes of God; and all men are
part of this vast island. No matter
how whites try to repress it in the
back of their minds, the only dif
ference between them and Black
people is the pigmentation of their
skins |

fortunate Blacks who realized that
material things should not be criter

variety of “pastimes” with which
to amuse ourselves as we course
through the winter semester. Un-
fortunately, the effect of his article
is anything but humourous: it points
up a serious defect in contemporary
thought.

Mr. Matthews suffers from
chronic malaise, he evidences a feel-
ing of despair when he writes of
what a generally rotten place WAL
is. He invites us to join his self-
flaggelation with tales of “Woe Is
Me™ and “Ain't This Place Awful.”
He says, “We should draw on each

class America and grasped the “new
man” armour. Brother King was
one of the pioneers who did not
fear the tyranny of the majority
but he helped pick up the lower-
status Blacks out of their abyss of
despair.

He was one of the pineers who
show the American society that
somewhere deep down in its’ values
and cultures something was wrong.
He challenged America in the
church, on the streets, and in the
courts to prove to her that she had
given Black people a bad check.
This check was made to all Ameri-
cans for the amount that “we hold
truths to be self-evident that all
men are created equal; that they
are endowed by their creator with
certain inalienable rights: that among
these are life, liberty and the pusuit
of happiness.”

Brother King showed the world
that particular check was void in
this affluent society as long as this
society held social, political and
economical concepts about the Black
mass which automatically gave
Blacks second-rated status,

Now, Brother King’s body has
left us but his ideas and soul still
remain a permanent part of our
mind and conscious, Brother King
went to the mountain top and his
eyes saw the coming of the glory
of the Lord. How long must it take
the American society to alleviate
poverty and injustice

Brother King, through non-viol
worked on the social consei
ence of America. How long musi
it take this society to stop trying
to be the international Friend of

other's misery, we must stick to-
gether and vomit en masse.” Mr.
Matthew's article waves the flag
of apathy and despair finding
“power. (in) innocuousness,
vacuity and overall divinely-inspired
disgust. . .”

This is meant to be funny. In
fact, Mr. Matthews own vacuity is
rather pathetic. In admonishing us
to turn on and to drop out Mat-
thews is being anything but original
and witty, rather he is breathing
once again the sigh of the Dis-
affected Young Man who in_ his
own mind is living in the twilight
of culture and whose fin de siecle
attitude gives witness to his own
moral bankruptcy. Ghosts of T.
Leary of Haight-Ashbury, of the
Angry Young Men rise from his
article and exhort us to join their
self-abnegation, But what did Leary
prove? What did the rioters ac-
complish? Nothing. Matthews, hei:
apparent and avant garde of the
Malaise Generation likewise proves
nothing.

I do not agree that Washington
and Lee, and by inference our sur-
rounding society, is the wasteland
that the elitists decry, Obviously we
have problems here at W&L and in
our country as a whole. But empty,
nonsensical articles such as “Re-
flections, etc.” impede progress when
they insinuate “Why brother?”, One
wonders if the only time Matthews
debate, meaningful relationship ot
interpersonal contact ” Satu-
rated with 70¢ Apple Run wine we
could hardly do otherwise.

What | am criticising is not so
much Matthews"s essay, which was
shallow and unimportant, but the
attitudes behind the articles. | am
criticising his antecedents who taught
my generation that the only way to
look at life is sideways, with a
sneer, Never have I read a truly
perceptive, dispassionate analysis of
a prpblem area in our society by a
young pseudo-intellectual: alone in
their other-wordliness they no not
contribute to human progress, Mat-
thews's atlempt at witty social criti-
cism fell flat because he would
rather vomit on reality than try to
understand it

My point is simply this: if this
generation is intent upon reforming
the world we must be deaf to the
prophets of doom and despair who
distort reality and call it emptiness
Reality is reality, not vacuity, Mat
thews writes from inside a vacuum
| prefer the outside.

Griff Steel, ‘73

For those who want to see what
all the fuss is about, Mr. Mat-
thews continues his impressions on
the next page. We request Mr,
Steel please to look the other way.

Kessling Raps Phi

To The Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

We read with great interest the
debate last week over Student Body
President Brennan's proposal to
make class officers members of the
Student Control Committee and find
ourselves asking: If incompetence
is here, can paralysis be far be-
hind?

We must go through the debate
word by word to understand the
irue implication involved. The Ring-
tum Phi stated, “Many members
expressed belief that by doing so
(placing class officers on the SCC),
the quality of the officers would
be immediately improved.”

Thus these members seem to be
saying that either the SCC is cur-
rently manned by incompetents of
that our present class officers are
incompetent. Mr. Merrill sems to
believe the latter since The Ring-tum
Phi said that he suggested
that the Brennan proposal might
further weaken the integrity of the
SCC.” lt also appears that Mr.
Merrill is none too happy with the
current SCC, We would remind him
the Executive Committee appointed
the current SCC members,

To continue—Our student news
pape: “Jim Overton, speaking
for the proposal said that he sup-
ported the action on the grounds
that, ‘since these pe ple (class offic-
ers) are elected they should be given
something to do’.” We wonder then,
why

said,

we have elected class officers
all these years

Mr, Keatley, repre
sentative, then injected his ideas into
the debate, according to The Ring:
tum Phi, by saying that
because the class officers were basic-
ally social offices, the placement of
class officers automatically on the
SLC could have the result of having
an all-fraternity committee.” Mr.
Gray answered this by saying he
felt “ Keuailey’s position was
invalid because the fraternity people
are the only ones seeking positions
of responsibility on campus.” We
honestly believe Mr. Gray will live
to regret saying that

We should not

Dining Out In Lexington

Sumptuous Fare at Kenney 5

By JESS REEVES

As anyone knows, the ham-
burger is the staple of the W&L
man’s diet, So, in our continuing
series on “Dining Out,” we sent
reporter Reeves to Lexington’s
one and only genuine hamburger
joint—Kenney’s on Waddell St.

Herewith, his impressions on din-
ing on a Big K.—Ed.

Too often many of us ignore or
are unaware of the finer things in
life. Such is the case of many Wash-
ington and Lee students who are
seemingly unconcerned with the cer-
ters of gastronomy in Lexington. The

expenditures in terms of time and
money are sacrifices the student is
usually unwilling to make, as long
as his stomach is full. The nearest
place will do for a small snack so
everyone runs to Central Lunch,
Paramount, or Mother’s and com-
plains of heartburn,

Why Can’t We Have
A Winter Carnival?

By J. JASON MATTHEWS

Talking to someone from Dart-
mouth is really difficult. | bet even
talking to a Franciscan monk about
the latest Fredrick’s of Hollywood
catalogue would be easier because
those poor guys at Dartmouth have
no one within a 100-mile radius to
go and visit and they know it and
it affects them. Winter really hits
hard and all around their austere
red-brick and ivy-green campus, cun-
ning little chickadees feeders and
squirrel roosts appear outside every-
one’s window,

The snow comes down from
Canada and up from New Jersey
and from either side, and the most
exciting thing Dartmouth men have
to look forward to is next month's
issue of Ski magazine. That is ex-
cept Winter Carnival.

If | ever would go to Dartmouth,
(assuming they'd have me), it would
be for Winter Carnival. In essence
it is a four-day snowy baccanale
featuring ice sculptures, parties,
tobaggan races, skating fests, and
for once in the year, women, From

Boston, from New York, from
Smith, Holyoke and Vassar they
come, for Dartmouth’s Winter

Carnival is like our Fancy Dress
used to be. It is an event. Christ,
even a Playmate went up to Dart-
mouth for Winter Carnival and had
a good time.
Anyway, this
thinking. Why

made me Start
can't we have a

Winter Carnival here at Lexington?
Why let Dartmouth be one up? I
have prepared a brief calendar to
illustrate that it is entirely pos-
sible. It would break up the drudg-
ery of Winter Term, and if we are
really lucky, some Playmate might
come down. (Even one of those
pin-up girls from Army Laff Time
would be O.K.).

1ST DAY—Friday

3:30—A special bell would begin
ringing in Lee Chapel to signal the
start of the DUBYANEL Winter
Carnival. To get the festivities roll-
ing, there would be a reenactment
of the Liberty Hall Volunteers drill-
ing on the vee of the Battle of New
Market. It could be a slapstick skit
with creme-pie fights and foam rub-
ber drill rifles that would droop
hilariously when pointed at the
spectators. A second skit at 5:00
would be performed for those stu-
dents in late-afternoon science labs.

6:00—A_ school-wide masquerade
buffet would be served in Evans
Dining Hall with an Eskimo theme
prevailing. “Gag” dishes like hard-
tack and walrus fillets would be
served,

$:00—Individual parties would
start at the different fraternity
houses, The group of independent
students not affiliated with a particu-
lar house would be divided equally
amongst the frats and invited to

Jack Paar Disappointing
As New Program Begins

Editor's Note: Last week, Jack
Paar premiered his new late night
talk show on the ABC television
network. The show is scheduled
to appear at 11:30 p.m., Mon-
day through Friday, of every
fourth week on Channel 13,

By BRYAN HATCHETT
R-TP Television Editor

Jack Paar defined his line of work
on last Tuesday's show: “I don't do
anything and later I bring
out other people to do it with
me.” This line, typical of others
that come upon talk show opening
monologues, prompts one to ask:
exactly how does the viewing public
want to be entertained after 11:30
p.m.?

The answer in most television
markets is movies. But for those
who prefer their fiction mixed with
video taped conversation, the al-
ternative is the late night talk show,

The genre is synonymots with
Paar himself, In his latest outing,
Jack Paar casts himself as the under-
dog trying to make a much de-
served comeback.

On Tuesday's show, with much
fanfare, Paar told the “W.C.” story
that sparked his resignation at NBC
and the demise of his “Tonight
Show.” And it proved to be quite
funny and unworthy of censorship
by today’s standards and probably
by the standards of the early sixties
when it was first told.

Unfortunately, Paar did not stop
there. As the week progressed, he
subjected his viewers to a surfeit of
gratuitous remarks about past op-
pression by NBC, the press, and
fellow performers and current op-
pression by ABC, his staff, and other
forces too numerous to mention

rhis nightly catharsis of self-pity
climaxed on Friday's show when
Paar, again in the underdog role,

explained that he had whipped the
system, the establishment (or what-
ever it is that he is fighting) and
would come out ahead of Carson
in the rating game. All very nice,
but who cares?

At the same time, Paar was pick-
ing a fight with some poor schmuck
who had the audacity to suggest
that the show was not the greatest
thing since sex—and to say it in
the New York Daily News of all
places.

With tears in her eyes, little,
buck-toothed Mimi Hines entered
on cue to tell all of America not
to stand for such talk as that and
to march behind Jack Paar all the
way to Armageddon just to prove

attend, Those declining would be
put in riotous Winter Carnival
Stocks and left out all night.

2ND DAY—Saturday

11:00—The Main Celebration
begins with the lighting of the
Carnival torch under those students
left out during the previous night.
As they thaw, tobaggan races, snow-
ball fights and snow-shoveling com-
petition would take place on the
main campus, Along the Collonade,
concessions would be in operation.
The Science department could make
delicious and different colored “sno-
cones” for the students while the
Religion department serve volatile
“hot rum toddies” to everyone who
has an 1.D. to preve they are 21.

12:00—Another masquerade lunch
buffet in Evans Dining Hall would
take place, this time with a Jack
London motif. An award to the stu-
dent who comes most convincingly
dressed as a mangy, hunger-mad-
dened wolf will be presented after
the meal.

2:00—The Ice Sculpture com-
mences in Wilson Field. Individual
students along with each department
would have an hour to freeze,
chisel, shape and contour their indi-
vidual creations, much to the enter-
tainment of the students looking on
from the bleachers, Numerous
awards would be given, and to pre-
vent the 15 predictable “recumbent
Gen. Lee” pieces, originality would
be foremost in importance.

The departments would be bound
by the rules to sculpt something
their field claims to be their own,
Hysterical results are no doubt in
store as gleeful students would view
the English department trying to
sculpt “onomatopoeia” or the His-
tory department carving their rendi-
tion of “hegemony.” Those competi-
tors sculpting anything obscene, in
the opinion of the judges, would be
put in the Carnival Stocks for the
night.

6:00—At this time, there would
be yet another masquerade buffet
dinner, the theme of which would
be Sergeant Preston of the North.
Prizes again would be awarded for
the male student most effectively
portraying Nell, the heroine, or the
most convincing female dressed as
Sgt. Preston.

$:00—Individual fraternity parties
would rage until the early hours
of the morning, the only difference
this evening being those who refuse

17 W. Nelson St.
Lexington

If one care enough to venture far
afield from campus, innumerable
establishments of higher eating can
be found in the city. We say, what
about Kenney Burger? Certainly it
must be worth the trip to the fringe
of the Lexington suburbs,

The KB offers students the unique
opportunity of enjoying good food
and good company, If one goes to
the Quid one finds oneself solely in
the company of fellow students. At
KB one can expand one’s horizons
while feasting on that masterpiece—
the Big K. Here the student can
rub shoulders with townies who are
full, happy, and docile.

Aside from offering the chance to
associate with your Lexington High
friends, the KB presents a fine
menu, There are, of course, burgers,
shakes fries, and dogs to be had.
The burgers have an unusual smell
and taste of carefully barbecued,
grade A shoe leather. The big K
shows all the artistry Kenney’s has
to offer in the burger line. (Order
one if you think the steady drip,
drip, drip of excess stomach acid is
worth 60c).

Chicken and Other Delites

Kenney’s hot dogs are really not
too bad. Beverages are strictly run-
of-the-mill. Chicken is perhaps Ken-
ney'’s best and strongest claim to a
place in “Who's Who in American
Restaurants.” The chicken delight
dinner at $1.30 includes all a home-
fried Southerner could wish for,
Such a varied and sundry bill of
fare is sure to keep the patron eager
and anxious for more.

Another strong point in Kenney’s
favor is the decor. Generally speak-
ing it looks like any other burger
joint, but a certain amount of imagi-
nation has been used on furnishings
as well as food. The large plastic
picnic tables inside are functional
but unimpressive (even for picnic
tables). A rather large, more than
alive and less than healthy fern adds
a touch of Victorian elegance.

In addition to these virtues the
service at Kenney’s can be fast and
courteous, at least, most of the time.
The window presents a panoramic
view of southeast Lexington. And,
lest we forget, the KB is conveni-
ently located next to what has been
called the Greyhound bus station
for those quick bites on the run,

The Kenney Burger can offer fine
food and entertainment reasonably
priced. One can dine handsomely for
less than a dollar in the midst of

Winter Consort’s Newest

By W. PATRICK HINELY
Icarus
Paul Winter/Winter Consort

Here is a prime selection for the
Global Village’s musical library. The
geographical and stylistic diversity
of the Consort's sources span the
panet, along with most of the uni-
verse. Winter calls this album a
collection of musical images of the
sun; it is all that and more. It
sounds nice, too.

Paul Winter has studied and played
the music of hundreds of cultures
the world over, He and the other
members of the Consort have had
the conventional conservatory train-
ing which all classically oriented
musicians must go through to have
a chance at professional recognition.

All have total control over their
instruments, David Darling on cello
is capable of making it speak any
language he wishes it to. Winter on
saxophone and Paul McCandless on
oboe and English horn set up beau-
tifully delicate harmonies. Ralph
Towner on guitar—acoustic, mind
you—has developed a style which

Salata

 

 

 

can be fit into any given category of

music and yet any other at the
same time.
Talking about individual cuts

from Tearus is luxuriously futile; the
sides are arranged in such a way as
to sound like different movements
of one continuous composition, but
they are at the same time each dis-
tinct unto themselves.

Attempts at categorizing and
labeling the types of music in the
Consort's sound is difficult, to say
the least. As closely and simply as
it can be verbalized, | would say

the Consort plays improvisational
jazz (what other kind is there?)
based upon any other types of

music from anywhere on the planet
you would or could care to name.
Indian, Brazilian, African, Baroque,
Romantic, Renaissance, Jazz( and
so on, All those and more.

Buy two or three copies and keep
one for yourself. Give the rest to
people you love. Tearus is much
more lasting than flowers,

This music is at home wherever
you take it.

Alumnus Chenery, Owner

Of Riva Ridge, Dead at 86

By PAUL SIMPSON

Christopher T. Chenery, nation-
ally known sportsman and a mem-
ber of Washington and’ Lee's board
of trustees, died after a lengthy ill-
ness at the age of 86,

Mr. Chenery graduated from
Washington and Lee with a degree
in engineering in 1909, He was
elected to the board of trustees in
1950 and served in that capacity
until his retirement some three years
ago

For two years he attended Ran
dolph-Macon College in Ashland,
where he grew up, but left school
at 16 in order to earn money to
continue his education at Washing
tion and Lee, where he was elected
io Phi Beta Kappa

On graduation, he worked for a
time in the Pacific Northwest as an
engineer then in 1914 joined a
reconnaisance party that was survey-
ing potential rights-of-way for the
first railroad through Alaska. The
group traveled by pack train and
raft.

Mr. Chenery served in the Army
Engineer Corps in World War 1
and later started his own enginee!
ing firm in New York in 1926. Ten
years later Mr, Chenery bought The
Meadow and began racing and

Blue Drops To Towson;
Takes On ODU Saturday

By JIM MOZINGO

In the past week Washington and
Lee has dropped its record from
6-4 to 6-6. The Generals gave up
a 10-point victory, 74-64, to a tough
Towson State team at home this
past Wednesday, and lost a close
one to the University of North Caro-
lina at Wilmington on the road,
56-54.

The Generals haye a tough week
ahead of them with Emory & Henry
at E&H on Wednesday and Old
Dominion at home on Saturday. The
Old Dominion game should be an
interesting one since this team is
coming off a two game streak
against major college opponents.
They defeated two Ohio teams,
Dayton and Xavier, and — should
pose a formidable obstacle for
the Generals. Especially’ gonsider-
ing members of the team
have come down with the flu in the
past week.

several

The flu may account for the sub-
par performance of Junior Skip
Lichtfuss and Senior captain Paul
McClute in the loss.to UNC, These
two had been, averaging 34 ppg.
between them but were, only able
to produce 13 pis. that night, Doug
Clelan however had one of his best
shooting night of the year and gen-

keeping the Generals close at ,the

in them. He as well as several
others are concerned over W&L’s
traditional apathy in supporting the
basketball team. Here | think it is
also worthy to note that though
the Generals have been very dis-
appointing most of the season, they

have provided some outstanding
basketball on occasion.
It seems doubtful that Skip

Lichtfuss, leading the team with a
19.3. ppg. average, will see much
action in the game Wednesday night
against Emory and Henry. Skip is
still being bothered by the flu bug

NOTICE

For those interested in trying out

which seems to be making its way

may be weakened by «he bug, as
most have been exposed to it,

No matter how W&L does this
week they have a week ahead of
them which should be equally, if
not more tiring than this one, For
next week the Generals play three
games ‘at home against three tough
schools, Rollins College on Monday
night, Madison on Wednesday night
and Virginia Union on Saturday.
No doubt Coach Canfield and his
squad will be happy to get out of
the month of January.

Some final notes: Bo
who started the season at forward
has been playing quite a bit at
guard lately, Freshman Gary Fitz-
gerald should play a role in this

front line. Freshman Norm Kristoff

is still out indefinitely.
Keep in mind that W&L is play-
ing a tough schedule, and even

though they haven't put it together

W&L Swimmers Keep Winning;
Take On VMI At Home ‘Tonite |

By CLIF OVERCASH

and JIMMY BAIRD
Washington.and Lee’s swim team,
home from a successful road trip
where they defeated Baltimore Loy-
ola 60-50 and Seton Hall 55-40, and
upped their record to 5 and 1, face
Davidson and powerful V.M.I. to-
night in a double dual meet in
Doremus Gymnasium at 8:00. The
Generals, on their way to one of
their best seasons in recent years,
have only lost to U.Va. However,
V.M.I. poses a formidable threat,
having lost only one man from a
team that beat W&L twice last year
and finished third in the State Meet.
W&L Head Coach Bill Stearns

 

candidly admits that “we'll have to
swim extremely well to beat them.”

V.M.I. boasts strong f{reestylers,
in Rich Brown and Lang ‘Meem,
who, incidentally, is the younger
brother, of former W&L swimmer
Bert Meem. The Generals will have
to counter with strong performances
from Billy Cogar, Steve Erickson,
Robbie Searles, and Jim Howard.

Cogar has qualified for the nationals

in both the one and three meter
diving, and sports a perfect record
in one meter competition. Searles
has been improving every meet, and
has recently broken Billy Ball's

school record in the 200 individual
medley. Ericksoh broke Ball’s rec-

 

orgy the 100 yard backstroke on
hi§ way tog qualifying for the na-
tionals, ant highlighting .tonight’s
meet should be a return match be-
tween himyand V.M.I.’s Bob Cun-
nigham. Earlier this year they tied,
and the electronic timer awarded
the rice to Erickson by a fraction
of a second,

Davidson, under a new head
coach, will be bringing a young
team to Lexington, and they should
add to what will be one of the best
home meets here this season.

The Generals will close out Janu-
ary with meets on the 25th against
Roanoke and Lynchburg, and on the
27th against William and Mary.

Jack Paar Resurrected Monthly

(Continued trom page 3)

whatever it is that Paar thinks he is
proving,

The sad thing is that without his
hypersensitive egomania, Jack Paar
is an appealing talk show host.

He is an intense person on the
air, desperately wanting to entertain
his audience. This intensity mai-
fests itself in a sort of bumbling,
jerky, but warmly human manner.
He interrupts himself as well as his
guests to insert mangled  adlib
sentences, typically preceded by: “On
my honor,” “This is the truth,” or
“You must believe me.”

No one can question his frantic
desire to be loved. It is a refresh-
ing contrast to the careless style of
his NBC successor, Johnny Carson,
who is away almost as much as he
is hosting the “Tonight Show.”

Paar knows how to pull together
what for another would be a hope-
lessly amorphous nightmare. When
it appeared that one of last week’s
shows was completely out of hand,
Paar reversed the momentum with
the remark, “Think of me as some-
body’s uncle who drinks too much
and is doing the best he can.”

Paar at his best is something that
Carson will never approach. Who
else could have introduced Jane
Mansfield with “Here they are...”
But his best came rarely last week.

The old master has something else
that neither Carson nor Cavett can
ever obtain: his acquaintances and
friendships with the notables of the
period of his original broadcasts.

Included in this distinguished
crowd are people like Oscar Levant
and Peter Ustinov who both ap-
peared last week on film. They are
people who are fascinating in their
own right, regardless of the boom-
ing nostalgia trade,

In a segment rebroadcast from his
weekly NBC show (after leaving
the “Tonight Show”), Levant, per-

haps the most famous hypochondriac
of our time told Paar what he did
for exercise, “I stumble, then I fall
on my face.”

The “live” guests on this past
week—Johnathan Winters, David
Halberstam, Truman Capote—were
not unexpected, but interesting.
There were a few zonkers, such as
country singer Loretta Lynn.

Perhaps the biggest shock was
seeing Peggy Cass as the sidekick
announcer, Is she Hugh Downs in
drag?

Predictably, there were the home
movies on the new show, but kept
to reasonable lengths and not about
totally uninteresting subjects. (The
absence so far of Paar’s daughter,
Randy, is evidence of singularly
good judgment on the part of some-
one).

Paar is hardly the most educated
man on television. He has said that
one of the reasons that he hired
Dick Cavett as a comedy writer
was because he revelled in having
a Yale graduate on his staff. Last
week, he unashamedly admited to
the ultimate intellectual sin: Paar
likes muzak.

No doubt, his lack of formal
education is one factor contributing
to Paar’s vaulting paranoia, But
the talk show audience does not
want a pedant for a host any more
than it wants an illiterate.

What it does want is a_ witty
urbane, and occasionally self-effac-
ing showman,

The “I-don’t-do-anything” line
belies the fact that Paar, when not
preoccupied by his own ego, is the
proper combination of the above.

Paar has three weeks to plan a
comeback from last week's come-
back. If the new new Jack Paar
can discard at least some of the self-
pity of both the original and the
new Jack Paar, he may be worth
watching.

he then went on to illuminate a

It is not the purpose of this

to identify the underlying implica-

we have misunderstood the true

most humble apologies to the

left-over “sno-cones” could be served

and their dates would mark the close
of the fun-filled weekend. After-
wards casualties of the past merri-

having frozen to death solemnly
buried, the survivors fondly de-
posited in the Infirmary, Study time
begins at 8:00, (1 hour later than
on weeknights), and the school
winds down, now girding itself for
another academic week.

So there it is. If we want it,
our DUBYANEL Winter Carnival
is within our grasp. Granted, plan-
ning will be difficult, but with every-
one pitching in, | think the dream
could solidify into a reality.

New Married Student Housing

painfully slow.

The University is now planning
to offer Virginia construction com-
panies a much larger package deal,
the cost of which would be ap-
proximaetly 1.5 million dollars, In
addition to the 30 units at Liberty
Hall other units would be built for
single students in the Weeds creek
area just northeast of Wilson Field,
The combined projects would house
168 students,

The head of the Student Recruit-
ment Committee, Larry Evans, was
also present to report on the activi-
ties of his group and their plans
for the upcoming Lee Scholarship
Weekend, He acknowledged that his
committee did not receive funds
from the admission office, but did
have use of th coffice’s facilities and
their cooperation.

Jeff Twardy suggested that
W&L—particularly the W&L ad-
ministration—put forth a much

greater effort into the recruiting pro-

grams were allocated student body

mittee,

The EC also passed unanimously
a resoluiton to place signs in the
Game Room of the University Cen-
ter stating that vandalization of the
pinball machines and other equip-
ment could be considered an Honor
System violation. The action was
taken in response to reports that
costly damage had been done to
these machines and that W&L stu-
dents were doing the damage.

single students, it faces the problem
of having to compete with land-
lords within Lexington and outside
the city. According to surveys Par-
sons has taken over the past five
years, students are moving increas-
ingly to the countryside.

Parsons noted that the University
may not have to build at all. A
private developer, who wishes to re-
main unidentified, has a plan to
construct a housing complex in Lex-
ington open only to “family units”,
that is single persons living alone or
whole families. This development
would consist of 100 units funded
in part by HUD. Families with
limited income could obtain rent
subsidies.

However the problem is resolved,
Hillside Terrace may have obtained
a stay of execution, for the time
being at least. That is good in a
way. One can't help the feeling,
while listening to Walt blithly de-
scribe the living conditions, that the
“Buy Bonds” spirit has somehow
persisted there.

averaging about 2 games a week,
regularly draws crowds of approxi-
mately 2,000. Student discount cards
can be had for nothing and are
good for 75 cents off any adult
ticket.

For those who have never been
to a hockey game it is a unique
experience. Hockey is the fastest
game in sports. It is full of quick
starts and even quicker stops, as
bodies go flying into the boards,
onto the ice, and into each other.
The game is characterized by fights
as frequently as goals, and to the
novice observer, it appears to be a
melange of utter senselessness.

Yet hockey is a game of grace, of
intense excitement, once the rules
are understood. It is a game with
its own special breed of hero. It is
full of of mames like Stachnick,
Paiement, and St. Sauver, but also
has its Smiths and Sullivans. Hockey
is three bruising periods of blood,
sweat and cheers.

If the Virginia sports fan is in-
terested in something new, let him
try hockey. A trip to Roanoke will
give him a glimpse of some good
and exciting hockey and might help
to create another fan. So get a ticket
and go see the Roanoke Valley
Rebels play. Take your friends and
discover hockey.

Applications For Dormitory Counselors Sought

Applications are invited for the position of Freshman and Upper-
class Dormitory Counselors for the 1973-74 academic year. These
positions are considered to be among the most responsible entrusted
to Washington and Lee students.

In order to ensure the greatest possible contact with freshmen,
counselors are provided with a single room in the dormitory and the
dinner meal in Evans Dining Hall, which they are expected to eat
with freshmen. Each counselor will also be expected to live in his
dormitory room seven nights a week and CANNOT HAVE AN
OFF-CAMPUS APARTMENT,

The primary basis of selection of counselors will be that of gen-
eral fitness to aid in making the Freshman Dormitories an adequate
environment for a student's freshman year,

Students who are presently Dormitory Counselors and who wish
to reapply for next year should submit letters to this effect to the
Dean of Students’ office BY 4:00 P.M. ON FRIDAY, JANUARY
26. In addition, returning counselors should indicate in their letter
if they wish to apply for Head Counselor or Assistant Head Coun-
selor,

New applications for counselor positions in the freshman and
upperclass dormitories should be filed in the office of the Dean of
Students by 4:00 P..M. ON FRIDAY, JANUARY 26. Such applica-
tions should be in letter form and should contain all information
that will be helpful to the Selection Committee, including previous
experience and the reasons for wanting the position,

All applicants for counselor positions will be interviewed by the
Head and Assistant Head Dormitory Counselors. Applicants will be
notified of the time for interviews after January 26.

Reading Day Is Favored
By Students, Poll Shows

Most students are in favor of a

reading day before final exams, and
most students don’t consider value
judgments as Honor System viola-
tions, according to the Executive
Committee's Independent Exam poll
results announced Monday at the
EC meeting.
Bob Brennan said that
there were two main conclusions
which were drawn both from the
poll itself and from various com-
ments made by students in filling
out the poll sheet. He said there
were a host of statements made by
students on these two issues.

President

Taking account of the general
favoritism for a reading day, the
EC considered two main proposals.
First, that a reading day be added
before exams start in the Fall Term,
as is the case currently in the Winter
Term, and second that exam week
be lengthened by a day either by
holding exams on Sunday during
exam week or by extending the end
of exam week one day.

The discussion on a reading day,
however, was tabled until the next
meeting so that each EC membe:
could examine the present schedul
ing on exam weeks during the Fall
and Winter Terms

As brought out by
Brittin, the current view of the EC
towards value judgments is that
such judgments may constitute an
honor violation, The current word
ing of the EC's view would, it

agreed, allow some leniency in re-
gards to what a value judgment is
and whether it is actually a viola-

tion,

Most of the questions asked on
the independent exam poll were
answered in a one-sided manner by
the student body. For example, on

the question asking if the inde-

OUTLOOK and REVIEW}
Keeping Exams Independent

A lot of people—students and faculty alike—seem to be
rather exercised over independent exams lately. The [xecu-
tive Committee not only took the trouble to run, on this
subject, another in its seemingly endless series of polls; it
actually called meetings in the freshman dormitories recently
to discuss the issue.

According to our informed sources close to the faculty,
Independent Exams seems to be a topic of high priority
currently on professorial lips. The issue continues to be dis-
cussed at University Council and Faculty meetings.

Many students suspect that there is a move on the part
of some faculty members to do away with the examination
privilege. An the immediate reaction of most students to this
prospect, is, understandably, sheer horror,

We students have come to live with independent exams
over the years and, if one conclusion can be drawn from the
EC poll evaluation, student sentiment is almost universally
pro, The independent set-up takes all the chance and arbitrari-
ness out of scheduling finals, and that’s a very good thing
indeed.

The main objections to the independent exam system have
been (1) that it constitutes a strain on the Honor System
and (2) that it is an undue burden for faculty members.

First, we don’t see any way of getting around the claim
that students are tempted to make “value judgements” about
their exams (e.g., “it was easy,” or “it was hard,” or “*!?*!?").

The EC poll demonstrates that not only are “value judge-
ments” tempting but also are forthcoming in great frequency
and virtually unavoidable. We admit this, but don’t see that
it is that important to questions of honor,

The real significant question lies in whether any out-and-out
cheating is going on. And every indication is—no more than
would otherwise be the case. If blatant discussion of exams
during the period is detected, there is no reason why it cannot
be reported and the Honor System enforced.

The strain on the Honor System would come when stu-
dents were told by the faculty: we trust you to be honest in
other affairs, but when it come to something important, like
finals, we'd just as soon not try your integrity.

As for the second objection, we can sympathize with a pro-
fessor who must grade exams piecemeal throughout the exam
period, when his objectivity woud be better served by grading
them all in a batch. This must be a real problem from the
faculty viewpoint, and we can only suggest that the deadline
for submission of final grades to the registrar be extended if
at all possible. It would be preferable to sacrifice those holi-
day grade reports (which usually come along after parents
have been sufficiently prepared and subdued anyway) than
to sacrifice the independent exam option,

Lyndon Baines Johnson RIP

As Americans our lives, to a great extent, revolve around
the Presidency—more than any other single man, the Presi-
dent, in his words and actions, reaches out and touches our
lives.

We are all aware of this; we don't really need a cadre of
journalists to remind us constantly of this fact.

Yet the point comes home hard, following an amazing suc-
cession of events over the last few weeks—a former President
dead, a current President inaugurated, another former Presi-

 

dent dead,

More than the passing of Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson's
death has stunned everyone—not only in its suddeness, but
also in its occurrence so soon after Johnson was in the very
center of some of the most tortured years this country has
ever seen.

Again, unlike Truman, Johnson's presence has been very
real and immediate to our college generation, All of us
remember the day in school when we heard the awful, be
wildering news from Dallas, the same day Lyndon Johnson
rose to the Presidency.

Then came the steady escalation of Viet Nam, the accelera-
tion of draft calls... and Johnson became subject to our
suspicions, then our criticism, and then, from many of us,
our hate,

Now that he is dead, a thousand typewriters will pound
out a thousand editorials—the man's great mistakes will be
laid aside, at least for awhile. Like John Kennedy, he will
probably be exonerated in death, snatched from an atmos:
phere of harsh criticism.

Lyndon Johnson was a thoroughly political man. In life,
he thrived in the midst of controversy—so in death, there is
no need to cover up his failures, He fell from power w eighted
down by his own arrogrance over the Viet Nam debacle; and
that grim lesson, so painfully gained, should not be lost with
him,

But he deserved, even in life, more respect and gratitude
than he received from us, No one can deny that he was an
effective and courageous President. As a legislator and a
moving force in his party, he was unsurpassed, \nd the Civil
Rights Acts can be credited, almost totally, to his vigorous
efforts.

As one small college newspaper, we wish to add our voice
to the many others expressing sorrow for the loss of a national

leader and a decent man,

Student Slams Editor’s ‘Bigotry’

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

It was with great interest that I
read the editorial concerning the
problems involved with the recruit-
ment of black students to the W&L
campus. The article was precise in
its assessment of the situation. I
hate to say that was the extent of
its merit.

The author should be warned that
the freedom of speech is a privilege
that should be used only by those
who have respect for the principle,
and not for the journalistic extra-
vagance of an immature young edi-
tor. The author of that editorial
disguised snobbery, bigotry, and
prejudice under the heading of re-
sponsible journalism and the free-
dom of mankind to function in free
and open society.

The writer of that editorial went
to excesses to abuse a group of
students which have in no way
offended him. The contemporary
black man does not think very
highly of individuals who make un-
warranted statements about him.
The editor of the Ring-tum Phi
used the power of his position to
institute his values upon the student
body of Washington and Lee.

In a blatant piece of character
assassination, he distorted the pic-
ture concerning the recruitment
situation, then he took time out to
interject some of his distorted values
concerning the type of black student
that “should” be attracted to W&L.
| do not resent his apparent pre-
judice; | do however, strongly resent
his pompous elitist type statements
concerning the black students here
already, and the ones that should
be attracted to W&L.

In both instances, the editor made
statements that were bigoted in tone
and implication. Some of the re-
marks made were on par with any-
thing Jim Clark or George Wallace
could have possibly expressed to-
ward Black people.

If you were really concerned
about doing a responsible job that
would have given honor to your
position, as opposed to the disgrace
that you have brought to both the
school and the paper, you would
have done your homework. Since
you are concerned with creatively
writing your prejudices and not with
truth, | will do it for you.

First of all, blacks and under-
privileged are not synonymous
terms. No Black man who is here
feels underprivileged. Not having
money is not a criteria for being
underprivileged. As a matter of fact,
were you to examine the situation,
many whites are here on financial
aid also. Are they undeprivileged
too? What you wrote last week
shows that, to a certain extent, you
are very underprivileged.

The next point is that you went
to great lengths to vindicate the
Student Recruitment Committee and
the Administration for what has
been assessed by everyone as a poor
job. Why must whites always save
other whites, even when their mis-
takes are so obvious?

You then do a good job (yes |

cause of the problem, a cause that
all of the members of the Ad-
ministration should know (and do
know, | might add). But like many
whites, your ego got in the way
of your judgment and you blew it,

You are going to be shocked by
this but you're not as smart as
you thing you are Mr, Editor. The
fact is that you're quite childish and
actually stupid. You fail to see that
many Blacks can do the work here
at W&L, but that these Blacks are
not the “white” oriented ones that
you desire to either know or as-
sociate with,

The position that you so perfectly
distorted in your editorial does not
have a five or six year remedial
stipulation to it. You are so blind
until you couldn't see that this is
not the way that W&L should move.
However, you fail to see that there
are Blacks—Blacks who for some
reason or another do not have your
“lily white” standards—who could
attend W&L and do quite well.
These kids get dealt out of a
chance to attend a school like W&L
because of the studly middle class
twerps like you. They're in all black
high schools that your recruiters
don't go to because they're scared
or too snobbish to venture into,
There are poor kids who are strug-
gling to get ahead in a world full
of people like you. Kids who would
give their back teeth to put up with
all that tripe you said should at-
tract a “black” to W&L. Kids that
are faced with having the stigma of
being a good black, from all black
schools, “but as we know, white
schools and black schools teach dif-
ferently, and that the black kids
would have problems in learning in
a white school like W&L.”

Look man, you're not doing any
black guy a big favor by letting him
come here, the blacks here have
all learned bitter lessons here at old
WAL. Bitter lessons that will last
« long time. And your comments
surely didn't make things easier to
stomach around here.

What the black students are try-
ing to tell you smart, white people
is that your doing the recruitment
program all wrong regarding blacks,
you aren't listening and you're
mouthing off incorrectly and while
its academic to you, its essential to
our survival,

Stop looking for “white” black
students; you're not Harvard, you're
a damn good school and the black
students are proud to be associated
with you, but you're not going to
get the truly outstanding black stu-
dent. He is going elsewhere. You
profess to be a great teaching insti-
tution; we want to give you a chance
to prove that.

Finally, it's come to my attention
several times that you are co1-
cerned about lowering your stand-
ards to accept black students who
are not outstanding (since only out-
standing blacks can do the work
here). You lower the standards for
alumni sons don't you? Why not
for Blacks? Does money truly
motivate you that much? Honesty
is very important in this matter—

"On Black Recruitment”
(Reprinted from issue of January 10, 1973)

Now is the time, after four years of success and frustration,
to take stock of the university’s efforts to recruit underpriviledged
students, And first, let us make it clear, we are talking primarily
about black recruitment, for black men have made up the bulk of

There is a lot of dissatisfaction going around concerning the
plight of the black students who are here now and the fact that
dwindling numbers of black students have been enrolled each year.
This dismay was brought into focus during last week's University
Council Meeting, during which Dean of Admissions James Farrar
gave the figures which tell the story.

The recruitment effort reached its zenith in September of 1970,
when, out of 36 blacks applying, 24 were accepted, and 15 were
enrolled, The following year, about the same number applied, 19
were accepted, but only four enrolled. In September of this year,
another 29 applied, 16 were accepted, and only three came.

How can this decline in numbers enrolled be explained? Johnny
Morrison, a junior representing the Student Association for Black
Unity, blamed the failure on a “lack of knowledge and experience”
in the recruiting program, But if the Student Recruiting Committee
can be faulted at all, it is not for their lack of industry, They have
proved themselves to be one of the hardest-working groups on this

The big reason WAL is not getting these black students is, of
course, the competition we receive from other colleges and universi-
ties, Contrary to widespread opinion, admissions standards have not
been arbitrarily lowered for black and underpriviledged applicants,
True, SAT board scores are, on the average, some 100-110 points
lower for the recruited students, But the admissions committee has
never held to these standardized tests as a rigid indicator, either for
whites or blacks; Dean Farrar steadfastly maintains that black
students are accepted on the same criterion as others, ic., their
ability to do the work at Washington and Lee.

Naturally, those black students who can do the work here are
going to be courted by the Ivy League and other prestigious institu-
tions, And this is where W&L has been losing out,

Two suggestions have come out of recent discussion on this
issue. One is that W&L should embark on a remedial five-or-six-year —
program, which would allow us to take underprivileged students ©
with whom we would not face stiff competition from other schools,
Secondly, it has been proposed that a man be hired to work in the
admissions office solely for recruitment of underprivileged students.

We object to both of these proposals, The first is, in essence,
lowering standards to fill a racial quota, a course which has led to
nothing but alienation and ill feelings on other campuses. The second
idea is undesirable, not only from the standpoint of having an
admissions man catering solely to one group, but also from the
standpoint of cost. Money to pay his salary would be money taken

There are things about W&L which should attract the black
student, just as they attract the white. The location and size, the
quality of instruction, and the curriculum are all aspects which allow
us to compete with any other school.

We must, however be realistic about both our goals and our
limitations as an institution, As a private college, we cannot afford
to outbid state universities for black students. As Dean Farrar has
said, our best bet to convince a black student to come here is to
show him the campus and introduce him to students. Herein lies

The EC must keep this in mind as they consider the Recruit-
ment Committee's proposal for an allocation to provide a “Recruit-
ment Weekend.” Black applicants could be brought to Lexington for
a few days in a context much like the familiar Spring Scholarship
weekend, A small investment here could perhaps provide the greatest

A Tour of Some
Lexington Sites

By J. JASON MATTHEWS

Recently | wrote about the wond-
erful opportunities afforded the stu-
dent by the W&L campus. Now I
write to inform those who don’t
know or don’t care about Lexington
and all it’s delightful possibilities.
Many times, on the “hill” or in dif-
ferent apartments | overhear dis-
gruntled students condemn Lexing-
ton as a “hole in the ground” or
as “a litter not fit for camels who
have just eaten many bushels of
green apples.” The following list
proves these pessimists wrong and
unable to continue functioning in
our society.

All around Lexington there are

delightful spots where the weary
student can find diversion,
THE ALBINO FARM’ ON

ROUTE 60: A_ fascinating socio-
logical study of how people se-
quester themselves due to the lack
of pigmentation in their skin. They
have constructed their own shacks
and live in an autonomous little
society. The curious should avoid
this place on sunny days as the
bright sunlight makes them irrit-
able. On one occasion they over-
turned a Rainbow bread truck which
had gotten lost.

THE OLD SITE OF NATURAL
BRIDGE: A little known fact that
Natural Bridge was once in Lex-
ington shocks many who hear it
for the first time. Due to lack of
tourist draw, the geographical phe-
nomenon was transferred to another

location in the hopes that more
profits would be possible.
THE OL D_ LEXINGTON

STOCKYARDS: Once a thriving in-
dustry in the town, the stockyards
provided the whole county with
freshly butchered meat. It was closed
down in the early 50's due to dis-
quieting rumors that the average
number of hepatitus cases had risen

considerably that year and the mys-
terious disappearance of the man
who operated the lard vats. It was
located on the hill which over-
looks the present High School and
the Bus Station.

THE HOME MAD JENNIE: A
Civil War widow, Mad Jennie was
supposed to have been livid with
envy on hearing of the courageous
exploits of Barbara Fritchie in
Frederick, Maryland. As the Union
forces of Gen. Bruce Shirley, a little
Known officer in the war, passed
through Lexington, Mad Jennie
leaned out her window which was
on Main Street, and shouted ob-
scenities at the passing forces. Gen,
Shirley, already in a bad mood be-
cause he had gotten lost and was
forced to march through Lexington,
gave a terse order. The cannon ball
that passed through Jennie’s window
and through Jennie herself as a
matter of fact, can be seen at the
Stonewall Jackson House.

THE GALAX TAR PITS: In a
situation much like that of Natural

Bridge, the Galax Tar Pits, after
being searched thoroughly to as-
certain that no prehistoric fossils

were contained therein, were moved
to Lexington as they offended the
residents of Galax by their acrid
odor and unpleasant appearance.
They cannot be seen now as they,
(the Tar Pits), were offended by
Lexington and moved to an un-
disclosed location.

Leslie Resigns As Coach;
McHenry Named

By MARK BROWNLEE

Last Thursday, in a surprise de-
cision, President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley announced the resignation of
head football coach H. Graham
(Buck) Leslie, and the appointment
of Athletic Director William D.
(Bill) McHenry to replace him, The
decision was reached over a relative-
ly short period of time. Early last
week, Coach Leslie approached the
AD and asked to be relieved of
his duties as head coach. Coach
Leslie, in a letter to President
Huntley, said that he had reached
the decision “as a result of long
and careful consideration.”

After accepting Leslie's resigna-
tion, Huntley immediately turned to
McHenry, who had plenty of coach-
ing experience at Lebanon Valley,
and who stated that he had missed
coaching. While at Lebanon Valley,
McHenry served as both head foot-
ball coach and athletic director.
His football teams at Lebanon com-
piled a 44-34-1 record, winning one
Middle Atlantic Conference champ-

 

McHenry takes on dual role. It
will be a challenge.

ionship and tying for another. Previ-
ously, he had coached at Penn-
sylvania Military College and Wil-
liams College.

Coach Leslie, a W&L alumnus
like McHenry, had joined the Blue
football staff in 1959, at a time
when the Generals had won bui
two games in the last four seasons.
As Coach McLaughlin's offensive
coordinator, he helped lead W&L
to seasons of 3-4-1, 8-0-1, 9-0, 8-1,
and 5-3 over the next five years.

Leslie had taken over the reins
as temporary head coach when Me-
Laughlin had died in an electrical
accident in August, 1968, Early in
1969, he was named head coach,

Leslie's 1971 team finished fast,
winning four of their last five bali

games. Hopes were
last season, The Generals had a
veteran ball club back, but after

winning its first game over a highls
touted Westminster team, the Gen-
erals could come up with only two
wins in their next eight games. For
his five year tenure as head coach,
Leslie had a 16-28-1 record.

As the new head coach, McHenry
hopes to revamp the recruiting
methods, so as to bring in new stu-
dents, who can help the school as
well as the athletic program. The
job will still be a difficult one, as
WAL still athletic schol-
arships. Another that he
faces IS a somelimes apathetic stu
dent body. McHenry feels that there
are many potential players at W&l
who don't give the football program
a fair chance.

oifers no
problem

For next year, the new Head
Coach has set up a full-scale J.V.
schedule. He has also planned for
another pre-season contest with Get

tysburg College, in addition to the

Bridgewater scrimmage. Two vars-
ity schedule changes have been
made. Hamilton College of New
York will replace Westminster, and

Randolph-Macon will replace Tow-
son State.

Personnel-wise. McHenry will
miss several of this year’s seniors,
but feels that he has a good nucleus
with which to work, Lewis Powell
is expected to provide the leader-
ship, and with his running ability

entor

and the return of Jim Farrar, Mc-
Henry feels that he might give the
Wishbone a try. Next year’s attack
will be more wide open, but will
still be based on the principle of
ball control. McHenry is especially
pleased with his two co-captains Bob
Brand and Bill Wallace.

His coaching staff will have Leslie
working as the offensive coordina-

tor, Piper with the offensive line,
Williams with the the front four,
Emmer with the linebackers, and
Aldridge with the secondary.
With his large staff, McHenry
feels that he won't have too much

of a problem handing both of his
roles, He did both at Lebanon, and
says that it will be easier at W&L.

Washington and Lee athletics is

more expansive than Lebanon's,
with more sports, better facilities
and a larger athletic staff. Coach

McHenry is looking forward to the
1973 season, and is especially pleas-
ed that he has coach Leslie return-
ing to the position which he per-
formed so well five years ago. “Some
of Washington and Lee's greatest
were when Buck
was in charge of our offense under
the late Lee McLaughlin. | am
happy that he will be helping me
in this same capacity.”

Varsity basketball action against ODU last Saturday.

Frosh Basketball Goes 6-1,
Shows Talent, But Lacks Socks

By JIM MOZINGO

Coach Tom Davies and his fresh-
man basketball team put on quite
an impressive performance Monday
night, even though they were play-
ing the W&L JV. The final score:
100-66. Not only did they score
well, they showed excellent team
play. The scoring was balanced and
all seven players on the frosh team
exhibited their potential at one time
or another.

The freshman were much more
impressive at the end of the first
half than they were the rest of the
game, but throughout they showed
the talent that has not only given
them a 6-1 record but the potential

that should give Head Coach Verne
Canfield an excellent sophomore
class to choose from.

The team seems
coached by Tom
proud of his team and program.
Davies commented that this team
has great unity; “They never fight at
practice,” Davies also noted that his
freshmen usually play more man-
to-man defense than they did Mon-
day night, but that only being allow-
ed seven players and several getting
into foul trouble, he had been un-
able to let them loose. Davies
charges seemed quite aggressive,
though in the second half there was
a noticable lapse of enthusiasm on

the boards. The first year Generals
also proved their poise under pres-
sure, when they easily drove the
JV out of a man-to-man press.

Despite the obvious ability of the
freshmen it was apparent that theit
performance lacked the one thing
that could turn these athletes into
the team they are fully capable of
being. A quick glance told all of
those at the game what they needed
desperately but lacked; new game
socks, This seemed atrocious to those
of us concerned with the W&L
basketball program. How can play
ers feel secure when they go in on

Fall to Rollins in 70-59 Decision

By BILL AUSTIN

The following of Washington and
Lee’s basketball fortunes sometimes
includes a rare, unexpected surprise.
Though the past week's activity
evidenced a pair of rather predict-
able losses, Saturday's 74-68 de-
feat at the hands of a strong Old
Dominion squad proved to hold jusi
that special kind of discovery, the
nameless sort of exuberance that
comes from the meeting and grap-
pling of two finely tuned teams.

Quite frankly, ODU’s accomp-
lishments particularly its consecu-
tive conquests of Dayton and
Xavier, seemed to warrant a genu-
ine concern for Canfield’s up and
down bunch. Indeed, the Monarchs
of Norfolk, Va., had come within
a point of upsetting VPI, and only
a month ago had silenced all poll-
sters touting Roanoke College as

the small college leader with a
five point victory over the previ-
ously top-ranked squad,

Yet, for a 20 minute period,
W&L gunned over ODU’s favorite
vehicle of defense, its 2-3 zone,
and displayed the poise of an ex-
perienced, gutsy club. Down by five
points in the early going, the Gen-
erals spent the rest of the period
on virtually even terms with the
favored visitors. The half's final
three minutes provided all those
fortunate enough to be spectators
with a game of contrasts: ballet-
like fulidity and fierce agressiveness.
In those few minutes, W&L actu-
ally took a precious, significant lead
of two points.

Contributors to this flowering of
success included Skip Lichtfuss, flu-
cursed earlier in the week, who
nevertheless showed reckless skill in

$ boys this year.

Challenge

WLUR Bottom 10...
Do you accept the challenge?

Even though we know they’re too scared to
accept, we challenge the “Bottom 10” of WLUR
to a rematch basketball game on Friday, Feb. 2,
during halftime of the W&L-Bridgewater home
game. To avenge our loss last year (in a game in
which WLUR had conveniently supplied the score-
: keeper), we promise to shellac the “rip and read”’

collecting 14 first half points and
several vital offensive rebounds, His
inside work complimented well the
floating 20 footers of Bowman Wil-
liams. Defensively, Coach Canfield’s
numerous substitutions offered a
formidable obstacle to ODU's obvi-
ously bothered attack. Though
Copeland, the team’s splendid for-
ward, managed 14 points, Rick
Michaelson, a burly gunner of ar-
rogant disposition, shot a_ bullish
4-11. Of special importance, Rick
Nau, a small guard of definite class,
threw away passes, missed shots,
and looked outhustled under the
close coverage of guards Smith and
Clelan,

With the second half’s opening
tip came a defensive alteration by
ODU's perturbed Allen, He ordered
his squad to play man-to-man, a
gamble that paid off with a reclaim-
ing of the lead. Indeed, for four
minutes, W&L scored only a single
point, and the resulting 45-40 ODU
lead never crumbled.

It was threatened, excitingly, for
the home team still possessed the
intangible knowledge that it could
win this game, an intuitiveness that
defied a common sense acceptance
of defeat. It showed when a 10
point ODU margin fell to four at
66-62 with under four minutes re-
maining. However, a Coach Allen
time-out, followed by a clever Nau
lay-up, checked the erosion and pre-
served the ODU margin.

The 74-68 win included 20 points
for Copeland, while Tom Street,
seldom such a pervasive force at
center, contributed 15 points and 16
rebounds, For W&L, Lichtfuss led
with 24 points, followed by 17
from the zone-taunting Williams,

The victory kept ODU's streak
intact at five, while Washington and
Lee received the inadequate com-

pensation of a .500 record and the
chance to unbalance the percentages
the following Monday.

Which it did . . . The opponent
was Rollins College, a no-name bas-
ketball school with a very big name
as its head coach. Ed Jucker brought
a couple of NCAA championships
to the University of Cincinnati a
decade ago. In that golden era, his
trademarks included a consuming
intensity for the game and a pas-
sion for good, tight defense. Both
were in evidence Monday night, as
Jucker barked orders and directed
a tenacious man-to-man coverage.
For W&L, the switch from ODU's
relatively generous zone to. this
hungary, scrapping defense did not
prove beneficial.

Rollins won the game, 70-59, and
proved conclusively that a team of
modest talents can succeed with a
strict adherence to the fundamentals
of the sport, with a patience for the
good shot. The first half witnessesd
the steady, unspectacular battling of
two evenly matched units, though
the shooting of Rollins’ Lonnie
Butler led the team to a 30-26 half-
time bulge.

The final period held the key, and
the mystery to the outcome, W&l
captured the lead for the initial
five minutes when Rollins scored
only once. With a six point margin
at 38-32, the encounter changed
drastically, permanently. The brief
lead disappeared, and a tough,
floor-smashing kind of contest
emerged, W&L maneuvered ably in
the scramble, but neglected to score.
Following Lichtfuss’ basket which
knotted the score at 40, Rollins ran
off 12 unanswered points, blending
a little-used fast break with plain
hard-working defnse. All the while,

Swimmers Nip VMI;
Meet Indians on Sat.

By JIMMY BAIRD

pick a “Swimmer
when there are 19
best performances on your team?
“It’s easy” says Coach Stearns.
“You name the whole team swimmer
of the week.” That is exactly what
he did in the wake of the Wash-
ington and Lee victory over VMI,
60-53, and Davidson, 81-30. The
Generals knowing that they were
going to have to swim their best
meet of the season to beat the
Keydets, came out ready, and after
dropping the medley relay, proceed-
to kick, pull and stroke to their
best times.

How do you
of the Week”

Outstanding efforts were given by
Steve Erickson in the backstroke,
Robbie Seales in the individual med-
ley, Bill Brotherton and John Hen-
zel in the butterfly, Rich Koch in
the breaststroke, and Billy Cogar in
diving. However, almost every
member of the squad contributed
to the win. A lot of depth plus a
few excellent individuals has been
the key to the Generals 7-1 record,
and Coach Stearns feels that this
again will be important when the
tankmen take on William and Mary
this Saturday.

Washington and Lee has not won
against the Indians in recent mem-

ory, and although William and
Mary has one of its perenially
strong teams, the Generals are

counting on depth to help them pull

an upset. Both teams have lost
only to U.Va., but William and
Mary finished second in state last

year and are looking forward to the
big number one spot this year. The
Generals are travelling to Williams-
burg this weekend, hoping to upset
their hosts, Cautiously optimistic,
Coach Stearns says it will be our
depth against William and Mary’s
individual stars.

Before this big clash on Saturday,
however, the Generals host Lynch-
burg College and Roanoke College
in a preview of the VCAA champ-
ionship in February. If successful
here, the Generals could boost their
record to 9-1 going into the William
and Mary event, and regardless of
the outcome the Washington and
Lee swim team is on their way to
their best record in years.

The team is young and Coach
Stearns is proud of their efforts so
far, and though he likes to take the
meets “just one at a time,” Stearns
is looking forward to strong finishes
in the VCAA, the CAC, and the
state championships.

If the swimming Generals keep
up their team effort, times keep com-
ing down, and the attitude of en-
thusiasm continues to prevail, Co
Captains Aven Sharp and Alan
Corwith will find themselves head-
ing a tough and winning squad,

Two Finish NC Marathon,
Qualify For Boston Meet

By JIMMY BAIRD

The Durham-Raleigh Marathon is
one of those grueling twenty-six
mile races which attract those
people hardy or foolish enough to
try to run that distance. Last Satur-
day, for a unique birthday present,
Mike Burns decided to give him-
self a run in this annual event.
With him was another Washington
and Lee student, Doug McNeel. The
two track men left Friday afternoon
and spent the night at North Caro-
line State. The next morning they
joined a crowd of 32 runners at the
Duke University Chapel in Durham.

When the gun sounded, both Mike
and Doug had one goal in mind—

s+, AND THAT MEANS
You, Too!

   

 

 

they wanted to qualify to run in
the Boston Marathon. To be able
to enter this prestigious distance

event, though, was going to require
a time of 34e hours or less, Burns
was aiming at just under 3 hours,
while his running mate, MeNeel,
was going for just under 34% hours
The pair were successful in their
efforts. Mike finished at the North
Carolina State track in Raleigh in
eleventh place, covering the 26,22
mile distance in 2:58, McNell finish-
ed seventeenth with a time of 3
hours, 25 minutes,

Mike and Doug were pleased with
their performances overall, but
Mike was a little disappointed at
not having finished in the top ten,
The finishers in that category all
received gift certificates. However,
considering the caliber of competi
tion (two of this year’s Olympic
runners participated) there is no
doubt that the two runners did an
outstanding job. Doug MeNeel plans
to go to Boston in April to run
there but Mike Burns is still unsure.
He said when he finished his race
in Raleigh he was sure he would
never run another marathon. H¢ +as
recovered to some extent, ble. the
decision is still up in the air. Which
he decides, best of luck
him. As for Doug, see
you in Boston.

in the Univ. of Virginia Civil War
Museum, the sawed-off shotgun
which was used in finally swaying
the reluctant Lee to take the post
is in storage in the basement of
Lee Chapel.

THE MISSING CORNERSTONE
OF THE LEXINGTON COURT-
HOUSE: Because it is hidden be-
hind other buildings and faces away
from the street, this is not a famous
sight here in Lexington. In 1897,
when the court house was being
built, it was discovered that the
beautiful engraved cornerstone was
missing. To this day, no one knows
the whereabouts of the expensive
piece of masonry, although some
claim the town treasury couldn't
afford one so they trumped up the
mysterious disappearance story for
the benefit of tourists. Note: (Any
contribution to the Courthouse
Building Fund will be accepted with
much gratitude.)

THE SITE OF THE FAMOUS
BLACKSMITHS CONTEST: — In
1884, two prominent and well-re-
spected blacksmiths decided to settle
the argument as to who was the
better craftsman, A contest was
arranged and a date set. The ob-
ject was to see which smithy could
forge the greatest number of horse-
shoes in one hour. The winner
would undoubtedly enjoy a renewed
business while the loser would be
faced with bankruptcy in a few
short months, The competition was
fierce. The hammers crashed, the
tawny sinews bulged, the red glow-
ing metal was rapidly shaped and
thrown into water to hiss itself to
coolness. At the end of the hour the
final tally was taken but it rpally
made no difference. Both smithys
had been dead for about twenty
minutes of massive coronary al-
tacks. They were buried in a plain
service and another blacksmith was
sent for from Chambersburg.

MacDONALD'S FORT MONUL-

MENT: Angus MacDonald, a pio-
neer who settled in Lexington, was

the first and only man to defend
the fort that was, in reality, the
original site of the Yown. During
the early years, Indian attacks were
frequent and the townspeople erect-
ed stout walls and a thick door
to ward off these attackers. One day
though, they all locked themselves
out and realizing their vulnerability,
scurried to the woods to hide, Mac-
Donald, who had been napping
inside awoke in time to find him-
self alone and the sole defender
against a fresh attack. Although he
repulsed five attacks he was finally
overcome by gunpowder, (actually
he stubbed his cigar out on a keg
of black powder), and succumbed,
The grateful townspeople erected a
monument on the crater in the
center of the town square. The
monument is no longer there as it
was torn down to make room for
Mack’s Discount Department Store.

THE MUSEUM OF HUNCH-
BACK MEMORABLIA;: Located
just a short distance out of town,
this quaint collection of photographs
and relics gives us the true flavor
of the prominent hunchbacks of
Lexington throughout the town’s
existence. There for inspection are
former Mayor J, Lane Freeman's
complete set of tailor-made gabar-
dines and Selectman Thorton Kilm-
er’s 2 foot-long ties. Of special
interest is the custom-molded bath-
tub of popular resturanteur Rew
S. Wertie, complete with Art Deco
mother-of-pearl inlays.

So whenever you feel down in
the dumps, leave your apartment
and go searching for the myriad of
fantastic sights that await you here
in Lexington. You will be hand-
somely rewarded for your trouble
and endlessly entertained, If you
still feel down in the dumps, there
is nothing that can be done for
you as the Electro-Therapy Genera-
tor Clinic that closed down in the
early 30's due to the inadvertant
crisping of a VMI cadet has been
torn down and the machinery
scrapped and sold to the Japanese
to be used in their traditional
“Harbor of the Pearls” celebration.

breakaways, knowing that any
minute their socks may fall. Some
players have resorted to tapping
their socks up. In this age of Pete
Maravich style non-conformity it
seems as if the athletic department
has taken wp the banner and pushed
the Floppy-Sock Movement a giant
step forward, Who could have guess-

Despite these heavy handicaps,

John Rice, a 62" forward, has

varsity in practice lately. Guard
John Podgajny was also playing
with the varsity until he was side-
lined by a knee operation in Decem-
ber. Both these players are making
excellent contributions to the fresh-
man team. Since the varsity will
lose three senior guards to gradua-
tion next year, it seems that Hal
Wellford and Paul Maloney, who
play the point guards on the fresh-
man team, Pogajny (Pod) and swing-
man Bo Poats will all have ex-
cellent opportunities to give WAL
replacements for the departing play-
ers.

made during the course of exams
week, and most admitted that they
knew that such judgments could be
considered possible honor violations.

A majority of students polled felt
that the reading day before exams
week fould be helpful.

In other business discussed at
Monday's meeting, the EC tabled a
motion stating that a reporter or
reporters representing the student
media should be allowed to attend
faculty meetings to report to the
student body the contents of the
meetings. Currently, faculty meet-
ings are closed to the student body.
and any action taken at the meet-
ings can only be related to the
student body second-hand through
administration sources,

Law School representative Jeff
Twardy spoke in favor of reporters
being allowed to attend the meet-
ings. Although the minutes of the
meetings are read at monthly ses-
sions of the University Council, any
motions passed or other actions
taken at the faculty meetings become
known to the students after the fact,
Twardy said, He also said any action
taken by the UC on the faculty's
resolutions would just be a “rubber
stamping” of the resolutions, That
the faculty had already passed a
certain proposal would influence the
UC to adopt a similar view of that
motion and likewise pass it.

Twardy also stated the presence
of a reporter probably wouldn't
impede the faculty at the meetings.

Dr. Milton Colvin, who was pres-
ent at the EC meeting, was asked

sociation; President Robert E. Lee
Associates,

Charles McDowell, speaking after
the ODK ceremonies, emphasized
two points concerning the 1972
election. First, that the Democrats
this past year managed something
historical—they rose above their
own constituency. Secondly, that
despite winning one of the greatest
landslide elections in history, the
Republican Party managed to come
out of the election weaker than
before it went into the election.

By rising above their own con-
stituency, the Democrats have again
to learn about the importance of a
coalition. The Democrats are losing
the traditional strength of the party
—the working class, “Archie Bunk-
erism cannot be ignored” in the
words of McDowell. The Demo-
cratic Party is progressive, but must
avoid the danger of abondoning the
people they are suppose to be
representing.

Finally, McDowell gave a warn-
ing to the new members of ODK.
Citing the purpose of ODK to en-
courage leadership, he advised the
new members to guard against the
danger of elitism and to “heware
of themselves.” In concluding, Me-
Dowell encouraged leaders to man
tain their principles and at the same
time not to forget to be responsible
to their electorate, passionate to the
problems of the electorate, and
hopeful by appealing to the best
in all of us.

his views on the matter. “I'd be
dead set against it,” he replied. He
said that much confidential material
concerning students is discussed at
the meetings, and that general
knowledge of such material could
be “embarrassing” to a student.

The possibility that a summary of
the meeting could be given to the
media after a faculty meeting was
also discussed, but the matter was
tabled for discussion after the next
UC meeting. The topic will be
brought up for consideration by the
12 students and 12 faculty members
of the UC.

Also at the meeting, Johnny Mor-
rison, representing SABU, said there
had been a “misunderstanding on
both sides” regarding SABU’s re-
quest last week for a $5000 budget.
He said SABU will come back next
Monday to the EC to present a
revised budget which would include
money primarily for “business
work.” He said the budget would
be no more than $1000.

Black recruitment was also dis-
cussed at the meeting. Morrison and
Dr, Colvin both presented to the EC
the idea of using black students al-

ready at W&L to recruit other
blacks,
Colvin said that such a system

has been employed at both Dart-
mouth and Yale with a high de-
gree of success. He said black en-
rollment at Dartmouth has increased
over 300 percent and that the black
enrollment at Yale has also in-
creased significantly. Blacks recruit-
ing blacks, Colvin said, seems to
be “the most effective way” of
recruiting in this instance. “A case
can be made to give blacks financial
support to go back to their high
schools to recruit,” he said,

Morrison said SABU has been
trying to get funds from the ad-
missions office for such a program
of recruitment, but admissions is
already in the red, according to
administration officials.

The EC decided that Brennan
would go talk to Dean James Far-
rar and President Robert E, R.
Huntley about the problem of al-
locating money to SABU for re-
cruitment before continuing discus-
sion on the matter.

and a full-court press. The Generals
grabbed eight straight points cul-
ting the lead to five, but the waning
clock and a number of foul shots
doomed the effort.

In the 11 point defeat, Lichtfuss
again collected 24 points, 18 com-
ing in the second half of play.
However, Rollins countered his pro-
ficiency with the placing of five
players in double figures.

The loss drags the season's tally
to 7-8, and places increasing pres-
sure upon the ability of this year’s
team to escape the persistant, nag-
ging drought of adequate field goal
shooting. One suspects that a good
night from the floor would go a
long way in adding offensive con-
fidence to complement the team’s
more than passable defensive abili-
ties.

At any rate, the next game in
a series of home contests takes
place tonight. The high-riding foe
is Madison College, a growing pro-
gram with a_ successful season
underway. Surely, a game of the
kind played against ODU is in order
for a reversal of current woes,

C Gives Recruitment Funds

The question of using student
money for the recruitment of stu-
dents was the focus of the Executive
Committee’s Monday night session.
In two separate actions the EC al-
located a total sum of $575 to be
used in recruiting programs by the
Student Recruitment Committee and
the Student Association for Black
Unity (SABU).

In both cases, certain members of
the EC—among them, Bill Merrill,
Rick Gray, and Archer Frierson—
were particularly reluctant to sub-
sidize programs which they believed
to be essentially the responsibility
of the administration.

The admissions office, however,
came under some strong criticism
during the meeting, and, ultimately,
both measures were passed to “send
a message” to the administration
that their efforts were falling short.
Both measures were voted also with
the stipulation that further funding
in future years would have to come
from Washington Hall.

Larry Evans, chairman of the stu-
dent committee, proposed a special
weekend to bring accepted “uder-
privileged” students to the W&l
campus. This. program would bring
eight such students, white and black,
sometime in March.

Rick Gray said he favored the
program as a one-year experiment

Mankiewicz Will Open
1973 Contact Program

Frank Mankiewicz, who recently
served as adviser to Sen. George
McGovern during his campaign for
the presidency last year, will open
the 1973 Contact symposium at
WAL on Feb. 28.

The topic of the former Peace
Corps official's lecture will be the
freedom of the press and the cur-
rent battle raging between the media
and government,

Mankiewicz has had experience
on both sides of the battle. He
began his career as a journalist for
the Los Angeles Times 25 years
deo

He joined the staff of the Peace
Corps during the Kennedy admini-
siration, serving in the organiza-
tion until 1966, Following this, he

became Robert Kennedy's press
secretary until the senator's death
in 1968.

From that time until he joined
McGovern’s campaign in 1971,
Mankiewicz worked as a_ political
analyst for a television station in
Washington, D.C.

Contact is an annual symposium
at W&L sponsored jointly by the
student body and _ Interfrateraity
Council of the University. The
symposium last year brought a num-
ber of well-known men tothe
university, including poet W. H.
Auden, Stewart Udall, Joseph He!-
ler, author of Catch-22, columnist
Nicholas von Hoffman of the Wash-
ington Post, artist Barclay Sneaks
and film director Philippe Labro.

that would be picked up by the ad-
ministration, if successful. On this
basis, the EC passed the motion,
which had been defeated a few
weeks ago, by 10-0 with one ab-
stention, The $275 was appropriated
from the EC’s Reserve Fund,

The EC was also presented a
proposed budget by SABU, totaling
some $930 for recruitment, pub-
licity, cultural programs, and operat-
ing expenses. The budget was to
cover this year’s expenses only.

After it was decided to consider
the SABU request item by item,
the EC debated the question of

granting more funds for black re-

Newspapers can occasionally be
wrong, and this fact brought head-
aches to W&L administrators re-
cently when a Richmond newspaper
erroneously linked the university to

a bill sponsored in the Virginia
House of Delegates which would
have exempted  university-owned

faculty housing from being hit with
local property taxes. The paper later
retracted the charge.

The reason for the headaches is

that, in effect, the article in the
Times-Dispatch, dated Jan. 17,
identified W&L as a “special in-

terest” in connection with the bill.

In truth, any connection of W&L
with the bill wouldn't save the uni-
versity any money anyway, simply
because WAL does not pay any
property taxes as such. Instead,
WAL. along with VMI, pays what
is termed a “service charge” to the
city.

The charge amounts to one-hall
what would be the property taxes
for university-owned faculty hous-
ing. And W&L, according to Presi-
dent Robert E. R. Huntley, is very
congenial in paying the service
charge.

A bill, first proposing that such
charges be made legal was first
introduced by Del. Charles Gunn

members agreed should be assumed

Several students were on hand
to protest the giving of student funds
to a racially segregated organiza-
tion; arguments on this point were
avoided when SABU spokesman
Johnny Morrison announced that
the group would be open to any
student interested in furthering
SABU’s aims, “regardless of race,
creed, or color.”

Law representative Jeff Twardy
said that if the Executive Commit-
tee funded the recruitment effort,

officials on the bill, and the uni

consented to the bill,

ed W&I. with the tax exemption
bill, which was sponsored by Del.
A. L. Philpott of Henry County.
WAL denied the article, and a re-
traction was printed a week later
in the Richmond paper.

Del. Gunn also denied WE&L's
connection with thre Philpott bill,

OUTLOOK and REVIEW
Tightwads On The EC

In a humdinger of a meeting last Monday night, the mem-
bers of the Executive Committee passed judgement on the
budgetary requests made by the Student Association for
Black Unity (SABU).

What was singularly impressive about this session, at least
from our point of view, was the manner in which it was
handled, Considering the issue at hand and the forces involved,
all the makings were there for a really vituperative, knock-
down-drag-out contest. That the proceedings remained on a
relatively restrained and reasoned level is much to the credit
of both the EC and the members of SABU.

What the events of the last few weeks have demonstrated,
if nothing else, is that the question of Black recruitment (and
recruitment in general) is extremely complicated, and, at the
same time, extremely sensitive. The Mencken Law of Dis-
course seems to apply: no matter what you say, it’s going to
make somebody angry.

In light of the disappointments concerning the diminish-
ing numbers of blacks coming to W&L each year, it was
inevitable that the issue would come to the fore. It was also
inevitable that the emotionally rarified atmosphere which
accompanied it would cause a great deal of confusion.

Take, for example, the reaction of some white students
on hearing that the EC was to consider funds for the Black
SABU group. Suddenly, there were excited protests about
doling out dollars to “special interest groups.” There was
even talk of a law suit to prevent appropriation of funds to
a racially segregated organization.

Fortunately, SABU spokesman Johnny Morrison defused
this line of action by quickly announcing that SABU would
henceforth be open to all Washington and Lee students
interested in furthering SABU’s aims, regradless of their race.

But the mere fact that people were so prone to react in
such grandiose fashion is cause for some concern.

It was somewhat reassuring to find the EC capable of
focusing on the really pressing aspects of this problem. First,
what is being done in recruitment and by whom? Second,
why has the initial success in this arear declined so mark-
edly? And third, is it in the province of the student govern-
ment to fund what are (or should be) essentially Admissions
Office projects?

There were, in fact, two distinet requests for recruitment
money before the EC. One was for $275, requested by the
predominately white Student Recruitment Committee—this
to provide for a “Recruitment Weekend” in the spring, dur-
ing which some eight underprivileged students (white and
black) would be brought to campus. The second request was
part of the SABU budgetary proposal, to pay expense for
black W&L students to travel independently to various high
schools, specifically to recruit black students.

The EC took a long hard look at both proposals: to make
sure (1) that these two efforts would not be at cross-purposes
or overlapping, (2) that such efforts would be funded, after
this year, by the administration itself, Ultimately, the com-
mittee approved both requests.

What the EC did not approve was the remainder of
SABU’s proposed budget, which would have provided operat-
ing expenses for the group other than those directly required
for the recruitment project. The members of the EC ascer-
tained that to do so would be setting a dangerous precedent
with regard to other such organizations on campus, which
presently rely on membership support for these resources,

All in all, some fine distinctions were made—distinctions,
however, which were essential to prevent more confusion in
the future. One EC member asserted that the group was being
more rigorous in its serutiny of SABU's plans than it had
been of other activities during the course of the year.

This has hardly been the case. As anyone who has re-
quested EC money knows, this operation is, more often than
not, like pulling teeth, Even routine allotments to publica-
tions and other established activities from the Student
Activities Fee required two marathon meetings at the year's
start. :

What we have sitting on the Executive Committee ts a
bunch of tightwads. And this is precisely as it should be,
The United States Congress excepted, most governmental
bodies are, at least nominally, conservative with the tax dollar,
So when the EC is charged with dispensing with students
funds wisely and effectively, it is right that they should do
so with care and deliberation—even if it takes a little extra
time and patience, —N.ELP,

Activism On The EC

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

This past Monday, the Executive
Committee voted to fund the Stu-
dent Recruitment Committee and
the Student Association for Black
Unity in their respective endeavors
to increase recruitment of under-
priveleged and minority students.
The EC reserved a right of account-
ing over both allocations drawn out
of the Student Body Reserve Fund.
The allocations do not in any way
reflect EC approval of annual fund-
ings of the organizations aforemen-
tioned, nor, for that matter, any
other similar student organizations.

These allocations, however, touch
two issues of substantial interest to
the entire University community, In
the first place, the EC finally took
a candid view of its reason for be-
ing and decided that it could indeed
represent students dynamically,
rather than in dogmatic, tradition-
oriented fashion, My thanks and
applause to my fratres in universi-
tate. Is there a light at the end of
the tunnel?

Secondly, the EC (once again for
the first time in memory), directly
challenged the administration re-
garding what would seem to be
an inflexible minority recruitment

effort. Dean Farrar’s January 4
statistical account of minority re-
cruitment in prior years made be-
fore the University Council can best
be described as pathetic. It is this
writer’s hope that the EC’s action
will result in a wide-ranging exami-
nation of admissions procedure and
structure, resulting, if needed, in
substantial reorganization of that
structure, Considering efforts now
being expended nationally on mi-
nority recruitment, and considering
former and current inadequate pro-
grams at W&L, isn’t it about time
that the administration admits
failure?

It is claimed that this liberal arts
institution is broadly based. Nice
words, but how broadly based is
the student body? Our approxi-
mately one-percent minority student
population is certainly a fine ex-
ample of tokenism at its worst. To
be broadly based and relevant as
a “university,” maybe, just maybe,
we might consider a broadly based
(and relevant) student body. And
that includes minority students, And
they include blacks.

We may still be General Lee's
College, but the General's been dead
for over a century!

Sincerely,
Jeff Twardy, ‘73 Law

More From White On Black Recruitment

The last time that | wrote what
was on my mind, other people were
caught up in a controversy that they
didn’t need or ask for. So that there
can be no mistakes this time, the
views given are my own and I
should be the one that you try
to intimidate,

Enough on small matters, let us
get down to the real problem. The
present recruitment policy toward
minorities is almost a complete dud.
In the last two years, only six
blacks enrolled here. That is not a
good job, that is a poor job, and
cannot be called anything but. The
New Orleans Saints work hard, but
they don’t win games and its on
that criterion that we judge a good
job or a poor one, winning or los-
ing. Our recruitment program in
this area isn’t batting .500. We really
should be trying something else.

The problem is that right now
we are at odds as to what constitues
a bright young black student. |
think that I know him better than
you do, and you disagree with me.

My argument is that the lack
of knowledge about this type of
student is what is the center of the
recruitment problem. You are using
the wrong methods to both locate
him and evaluate him if you hap-
pen to stumble across him. First
you look for him in the wrong
places, places that are secure for
you—prep schools, academies, and
“white” public high schools. He's
not there, he’s somewhere else, and
you're afraid to go there. Secondly
he’s not readily detected by the
things that you use to find students,
Board scores won't help you, grades
might, but they probably won't, and
the special agencies that you call
in won't either, to tell you the
truth. The reason is because these
things might be nonexistent for him.
If they aren't low, then they are
not complete.

And the assumption is that if
they are either low or incomplete
then the person involved can't be
worth much, This is where you are
wrong! He might be worth many,
many more times the price of gold,
but we will never get to know
will we? Did you ever ask yourself
why? He could be the product of a
poor inner city school that really
doesn't care how he gets along.

Terrible you say, but aren't you
just as bad by not giving him a
chance to better himself. The
United Negro College fund's slogan
is “A MIND IS A TERRIBLE
THING TO GO TO WASTE.”
Isn't that what we are doing when
we ask that a student from this
type of environment be judged on
the same level as a “white prep
school student.” This is a shameful
way to use the principle of de-
mocracy.

Mr. editor, | hit you the last
time; I'm not sorry for what |
said. Many people that | loved
died so that | could come to a
school like this one day, They
fought for me: Now | Must Fight
For Them.

Instead of the wasteful policy that
we have now, we should be trying
to find people who would appreci-
ate the opportunity to attend an
institution like WAL,

This is where the problem be-
comes acute, Many people say that
to do this would mean a “lowering”
of the standards of Washington and
Lee at great cost, I find those posi-
tions both false and irrelevant, A
lowering of the standards is done
now and the reason behind it is
money. Why, if need be, can't we
“lower” the standards for a reason

like the education of oppressed
people, or the betterment of society,
aren't they just as valid? Is the
love of money really that important
to a school that is as comfortable
as this one?

This type of student, the one
that doesn’t want to go to Harv-
ard, wants to go anywhere. He
doesn't have the qualities that we
look for in a student. Those quali-
ties are the ones that you put on
paper, grades, test scores and the
rest of the ego material. This kid
wants to get ahead, has the talent
to get ahead, but lacks the op-
portunity. Why can’t Washington
and Lee give him that chance?
| think I can find him for you
better than you can, because I used
to be one of those guys.

The question is are you willing
to accept him? He’s not as “intel-
ligent” as you, nor as urbane in
many cases, he’s “poorer” than you
are and above all he’s different. Are
those things strong enough to keep
him out? At the present they are,
do they have to be that way always?
It's not going to hurt you financi-
ally one damned bit, and any man
that says it will is a liar, We have
the money when we want it so
why can’t we have it now,

The whole apporach must be
changed concerning black students,
figures and test scores are irrelevant,
grades are too, even class rank
and the rest are not the most
accurate sources, because they don't
even measure what they are sup-
posed to measure accurately let
alone things like desire and motiva-
tion,

| might be an idealist, but I'm
convinced that at least that way |
could have some respect for my
institution as one that was receptive
to human needs rather than a money
oriented power mad ideology.

Mr. editor, | hope that what |
have written is worth another state-
ment by you. Are you against the
policy that | have laid down? The
vitriol is gone, so don't make light
of the issues, give me and the rest
of the student body another sampl-
ing of your abilities.

To the other people that are in-
volved in this matter I would like
to hear from you, | have a much
thicker skin than you obvisiously
have so | am waiting to hear
from you as well, Remember, when
you have to look up a particular
subject, that you don't know very
much about you go to the library,

Letters To The Editor...

Are Art Courses ‘Gut’? .

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

I want to address a few com-
ments on the situation in the art
department. I speak not as an art
major but as a member of the
general undergraduate student body
who has taken three art courses,

By now most students have heard
that the art department is adopting
a much tougher grading scheme in
response to criticism that it is lax
in grading. Let me preface my
comments with a review of the
facts, my having been present at the
Arts Council meeting of 17 January
and at the confrontation which took
place 25 January in Art 308. The
Arts Council meeting was set up
by Ken Lane for the purpose of
bringing together various groups of
people interested in improving the
fine arts at W&L. Present were Dr,
Stewart, Dr. Doyon, Mr. Kahn,
Dr. Pellicciaro, Ken Lane, Deans
Watt and Pusey, along with num-
bers of students ranging from 20
to about 35,

The remarks by an art major
which precipitated the changes came
in the context of a conversation in
which the art majors (several being
present at the time) were complain-
ing that their department devotes
more time to the non-art-major
than to those students with a speci-
fic interest in art.

They mentioned that there are no
upper level courses designed for the
art major, and that there is no
orderly progression in the study of
art history, i.e., any student can take
any course at any time without pre-
requisites. They seemed to feel that
the quality of instruction was
“watered-down” to meet the needs
of the general student, and that they
were not getting the special atien-
tion which they deserve.

Then came the fatal remarks—
“I'm ashamed to be an art major,”
and “The are department only has
gut courses.” Dr Doyon was visibly
embarrased by this. transaction.
Later the conversation shifted and
I left, shortly before Dr. Doyon
walked out.

The next week in a highly emo-
tional scene Dr. Doyon revealed

:

“VD BNA,
“UPR AND

that he had been taken to task by
the academic deans for the utter-
ances of his student and he was
instigating strong measures to in-
sure that the art department lose
its reputation for being “gut,” in
order that he may “hold his head
up among faculty.”

Several points are at issue, not
withstanding the validity of the art
majors’ complaints. | think one of
the problems is the inability of the
art student to clearly articulate their
dissatisfaction and to suggest precise
remedies: the Arts Council was
fogged by the ramblings of some of
the most inarticulate people I have
ever heard.

However, the major issue is not
what the students had to say but
what the Deans had to say. In my
opinion the Deans went overboard
and attached too much significance
to the rash words of one student,
They were too zealous in repri-
manding a fine teacher, causing him
in turn to act rashly, The real
question is how much does Wash-
ington Hall dictate how a_profes-
sor grades?

The ramifications of the Deans’
“suggestion” to Dr. Doyon go far
beyond the art department; it should
be a matter of concern to all teach-
ing professors. The academic de-
partment is the organizational back-
bone of the university, and if the
preogatives of the department chair-
men are impinged upon by outside
forces, then it is a serious threat
indeed to academic freedom. The
helplessness of the student, shut out
of the decision making process, is
apparent in crises such as these.

I hope Dr. Doyon repeals his de-
cision to grade the class on a strict
bell-curve basis. The old question
of grades as an indicator of success
is once again brought out, with the
Deans obviously on the side of
grades (preferably bad). The ex-
cellence of a department is not
measured by the grades it gives.
The student body should support a
man, whose ability to teach is un-
impeachable, from unjust meddling
by Washington Hall.

Griff Steel, °73

Macabre Movies

By BILL McILHANY

The first in a proposed series of
motion picture showings of the most
characteristic fantasy, science-fiction,
and horror movies from the pasi
will be held this Saturday night,
February 3rd, at 10:00 p.m. in du-
Pont Auditorium,

The two films scheduled for this
weekend are sponsored by the Uni-
versity Center Committee and are
quite rare and distinctive examples
of two very different kinds of hor-
ror movies,

The first film is “The Undertaker
and His Pals.” Produced in color
in 1966 by Alex Gratien for Bola
Pictures, this movie in an unfor-
gettable member of a series of
films which have developed since
Roger Corman'’s “A Bucket of
Blood” almost a decade and a half
ago.

Written and not-well-directed by
L. C. Swicegood, “The Undertaker
and His Pals” tells the story of a
mad undertaker who only charges
$144.98 initially for a funeral, He
is guaranteed continual customers
by his psychotic pals.

Together they operate The Greasy
Spoon Diner and merchandise por-
tions of the patronage they create
for Morte the undertaker. This
cynical, “sick” comedy aliernates

silly jesting with some of the most
visually explicit mutilation murders
ever included in a film,

There is a cameo appearance by
that star of many a mystery, serial
and horror movie in the 1940's,
Robert Lowery, Ray Dannis’ por-
trayal of Morte the undertaker is
also notable,

Johnny White's soap opera music
makes the audience tense in ex-
pectation of the film's delightful
climax, Andrew Janezak’s photo-
graphy is best and accidentally most
effective in the night scenes,

The second film to be shown
Saturday is the 1954 production of
Maurice Sandoz’s The Maze, star-
ring Richard Carlson, This film is
unusual because of the powerful
effect of its grim, gothic, dramatic
atmosphere—every bit as expressive
of Sandoz’s novel as were the origi
nal illustrations by Salvador Dali
which accompanied it,

A man leaves his home to inherit
a huge castle and grounds left to
him by a departed relative, Strange
events occur after his arrival, lead-
ing up to his final discovery of the
truth concerning his late relative,
the curse allegedly carried by the
family, and the terrible secret of the
castle's gigantic garden maze

Admission for these fila

is $1,

By KEN RUSCIO

Amidst the excitement of basket-
ball, the success of swimming and
wrestling, and the beginning of base-
ball and lacrosse training, the Wash-
ington and Lee track team quietly
began its season last Thursday night
in a five team meet at the V.M.1.
fieldhouse. Coach Norris Aldridge
revealed a team with potential to
attain significant honors, Placing
third behind a_ well-conditioned
V.M.I. contingent and a surprising
Christopher-Newport team the Gen-
erals served notice that their con-
ditioning program is right on sched-
ule. At this stage the team is in the
agonizing process of early season
training providing for a “peak”
sometime during the late outdoor
season,

Nevertheless, there were some
notable performances Thursday
night. Paul Suthern returned after
a year’s absence to win the 60 yard
high hurdles in the quick time of
7.8 and also take a third in the low
hurdles. Paul Hartmann grabbed
another first for the team by vault-
ing 12 feet. Second place finishes
were recorded by freshman Mark
George (high jump) and sophomore
Barclay Armstrong (long jump).
Armstrong came back to take fourth
in the triple jump.

In the distances Bill Kalal gave
indications of a promising season by
taking a close third in the two mile.
Marathoners Mike Burns and Doug
McNeel were still feeling the effects
of their latest 26 mile ordeal but
were not far behind, Co-captain
Bob Sherwood found the mile field
a little too rough but was pleased
with excellnet early season time of
4:39, The distance team, however,
would be greatly aided by the re-
turn of Stu Nibley, who is being
restricted to modest training due to
an achilles tendon injury.

The mile relay, the last event of
the evening, and appropriately the
most competitive, was clearly the
highlight of the meet, From the
start it was all VMI and W&L with
Christopher-Newport, Lynchburg,
and Madison well out of the race.
Dave Estes, Phifer Helms, and Dave
Lawson turned in excellent splits
giving the anchor leg a small deficit
to overcome on a class VMI team.

course is given in the country
where the student will attend
medical school.

In addition, the European Medi-

Then Brandon Herbert, coming off
a narrow loss in the 600 yard run,
took over. In the end, the Generals
had missed by inches but gave proof
that in the very near future (per-
haps this Saturday at the VMI re-
lays) this determined unit will be
looking back to find most of its
opposition.

Notable meets on the agenda for
this year’s indoor track team will
be the Lynchburg Relays (Feb. 24),
the State Meet (Feb, 28 at VMI)
and the VCAA _ championship
(March 3).

Tankers Up Record,
Warm Up for VCAA

By CLIF OVERCASH

The Washington and Lee swim
team upped its record to 9-2 last
week, beating Lynchburg 64-47 and
Roanoke 71-40 on Thursday, and
losing to William and Mary 57-56
on Saturday, Jan. 27. The dual meet
against Roanoke and Lynchburg pro-
vided Generals fans with a preview
of the upcoming Virginia College
Athletic Association Meet to be held
in Doremus Gym February 9 and
10. W&L, with many top swimmers
not participating, easily won the
meet and eagerly anticipates bring-
ing home the Virginia small college
trophy. Top performers for the Gen-
erals included Jim Howard in the
backstroke, Mike Moore in the 1000
free, Craig Graham in the 200

Grapplers Win 2 Out of 3;
Up Year's Record to 7-4

The W&L grapplers hosted this
last Saturday a big Quadrangular
Meet, and came out of it very
well. Opponents for the weekend
included the University of North
Carolina, Furman, and VMI. The
Generals had little trouble handling
their opponents from down south,
as they dumped the Tar Heels 35-6,
and easily handled the Purple Pala-
dins 26-9, But things weren't so
easy when the Blue took on their
cross-town rivals. The Keydets have
a strong team, and were out for
revenge, after their swimming com-
patriots had been swamped by the
Generals. The final tally gave VMI
a 21-14 victory.

The Quad Meet was marked by

several outstanding performances,
Dan White (134) came up with wins
in all three matches. Jim Stieff (150)
grabbed three triumphs, including
pins over VMI and UNC. Don
Overdorff (118) won two and tied
VMI.

On January 19-20, the Generals
had traveled to the Tar Heel state,
where they had split two matches.
They edged Davidson 22-18 and lost
to NC State, 24-14.

This Saturday, the Blue host
another big Quadrangular Meet.
Virginia Commonwealth University,
Campbell College, and Pembroke
will all take on the Generals at 12
in new Doremus Gymnasium.

breaststroke, and Billy Cogar in the
diving,

On Saturday the team traveled to
Williamsburg to face the Indians
of William and Mary. William and
Mary finished second in the state
meet last year to W&L’s fourth, and
the Generals knew they had to swim
their best to win,

The first event, the medley relay,
was won by W&L’s team of Steve
Erickson, Rich Koch, Bill Broth-
erton, and Jimmy Howard, Other
WL first places went to Brotherton
in the 200 fly, Erickson in the 200
backstroke, Cogar in the 1 meter
required and optional diving, and
the 400 free relay team of Robbie
Searles, Alan Corwith, Aven Sharp,
and Howard. Strong performances
by Searles in the 200 individual
medley, Bill Tiers in the 100 free,
and Tom Young and Gary Seldom-
ridge in the 1000 free could not
overcome the powerful Indians and
their one man show—Joe Acker-
man, who won the 1000 free, the
200 1.M., and the 200 breaststroke.
By the end of the meet, the Gen-
erals found themselves on the short
end of a 57-56 score.

On February 9-10, Washington
and Lee will host the V.C.A.A.
State meet. Teams participating in-
clude Roanoke, Lynchburg, Bridge-
water, Hampton Institute and Ran-
dolph-Macon, W&L head coach Bill
Stearns believes that “we're the team
to beat in the VCAA.” The next
weekend is the Virginia State
Championship meet, and W&L
would very much like to revenge the
loss to the Indians, This should be
quite an exciting meet.

Hoopers Split Pair,
Look To Bridgewater

By JIM MOZINGO

Washington and Lee split its two
games this past week, defeating
Madison College 65-57 on Wednes-
day night, and losing to Virginia
Union in a particularly hard fought
contest 72-70. Despite the Generals
8-9 record they are beginning to
play the basketball that many have
expected of them all year long.
With the exception of the first half
of the Madison game, Verne Can-
field’s charges have played solid
basketball.

The first half of that Madison
game had the fans in an uproar
because of the ineptness shown by
both teams; in fact it was so
contagious that it spilled over into
the officiating, which never did seem
to recover. The game began with
WAL controlling the tip and for the
next several minutes the game
consisted of W&L shooting and
tipping wildly at one end, Madison
finally controlling the ball, dribbling
to the other end of the floor where
they were hounded by a tenacious
defense. The ensuing floor scramble
for the ball usually resulted in a
Madison turn-over, The fans grew
gradually more restless as neither
team could move effectively on
offense. In fact, I’ve seen higher
scoring first halves at football
games. Though the Generals offen-
sive efforts were continually blunt-

ed, the Dukes were even worse,
One spectator ventured that the
“Madison cheerleaders mounted

more of an attack” than their team
did in the opening minutes of the
ball game.

McClure scored for W&L at
18:04, the first of his 13 points,
The Generals allowed Madison little
room to manuever in, but Madison
returned the favor at its end of
the court. The Dukes finally got
their first point at 13:55 of the first
half, over six minutes after the
opening tip-off. But W&L’s offensive
play had been so atrocious that the
foul shot made the score 8-1, For
the next two or three minutes
Madison outscored the Generals 6-
1. The Dukes began to score in the
middle as W&L's shooting got
colder, if that was possible, Skip
Lichtfuss was forced out of the
game at about the 8:00 mark with
a minor injury. Now instead of
working towards Lichtfuss, the Gen-
erals worked to Guy Kerr's wing.
However about the only bright spot
in the scoring came when Madison's
coach was freely given a technical
foul, allowing W&L’s only legiti-
mate foul shooter Doug Clelan to
make one from the line. The inept-
ness continued, sporadically inter-
rupted by more ineptness as Madi-
son’s cheerleaders got into the act,
The half ended at 22-20 in favor
of the Dukes.

The crowd was particularly vocal
this night, even more so than
against Rollins, spurred not only by
the horrible play on the court but
by a large contingent of Madison
students. Coach Canfield should be
happier now, as earlier in the sea-
son he had questioned the backing
of the student body. Even if they
were critical at least they returned
for the second half in which a much
better brand of basketball was ex-
hibited,

The second half began propheti-

cally as Bowman Williams hit from
30 feet. Lichtfuss got hot and Mc-
Clure began to dominate the boards,
This was to be another night when
the Generals were to get a boost
from their outstanding freshman
Gary Fitzgerald. The Generals de-
fense constantly hounded Madison
into turn-overs and bad shots. As
the time on the clock waned the
Dukes began to come apart at the
seams. Washington and Lee went
into its four corners at 2:17 to in-
sure a 65-57 victory over the Dukes.
Lichtfuss got 20, Clelan 12, and
McClure 13.

This left W&L looking toward
Saturday night when they would get
the chance to break .500, However
this was not to be. The Generals
ran into an extremely physical Vir-
ginia Union team and couldn't quite
get over the hump. The Generals
were betrayed by the foul shooting
which has hurt them all year long,
as Virginia Union out-fouled them
22-14, But not only did the Panth-
ers have the W&L foul shooting and
their own muscle, but an excellent
and seemingly inexhaustable bench.
The Panther starters only accounted
for 32 of the 72 points the team
scored, Sam Lockhart came off the
bench to provide a constant thorn
in the Generals’ side, scoring 20
points from just about ever imagin-
able spot on the court, Another
interesting aspect of the Panthers
was that senior guard and three-year
letterman Andrew Hazley seemed
to coach the team much of the
time. This was especially evident
during time-outs.

But whatever Hazley told his
teammates seemed to work, as they
fought back from behind despite
numerous errors which the Generals
were unable to take full advantage
of. Virginia Union was especially
tough where W&L likes to get most
of its points, inside. All night the
Generals had trouble controlling
their own boards, much less getting
a second shot on offense. As the
game ground to a close, both teams
were playing strong basketball.

With 0:15 left on the clock W&L
missed a shot inside that would
have tied the game. The Panthers

The final university-wide event of
this “Fancy Dress” weekend will be
a dance in the Old Gym, featuring
“Daddy Rabbit” and “Voyce,” on
Saturday night at 8 p.m. This dance
is sponsored by the University Cen-
ter and admission will be collected

at the door, (Dance plans are not
applicable to this event.)

Billy Preston’s appearance will
mark the third concert sponsored
this year by the W&L Dance Board.
Previously, they have hosted Malo
and the J. Geils Band.

Preston has recorded two singles
which hit the charts with success—
first, “That’s the Way God Planned
It’ and second, “Outer Space,”
which received designation as the
top instrumental of the year in 1972,

A native of Houston, Texas,
Preston toured with Little Richard
ten years ago, his first introduction
to rock and roll. Since then he has
worked on sessions with Carole
King, Barbra Streisand, Stephen
Stills, Merry Clayton, Ray Charles,
and Aretha Franklin, as well as
having been a member of the tour-
ing Plastic Ono Band with John
and Yoko.

After recording two albums, pro-
duced by George Harrison, for
Apple, Preston recently joined
A&M records, for whom he has
cut his first solo album.

As usual, tickets for those who
do not hold Dance Plans will be
sold at the door at $5.00 per person.

Dick Gregory To Speak
In ‘Contact’ Symposium

Dick Gregory, social critic and
comedian, will come to Washington
and Lee University March 5 as part
of Contact '73, W&L’s annual sym-
posium sponsored by the student
body and the Interfraternity Coun-
cil,

Gregory is the second speaker
announced thus far for this year’s
symposium. Contact °73 last week
announced that Frank Mankiewicz,
former journalist and aide to Sen.
George McGovern in his bid for
the presidency last year, would open
the program Feb. 28.

Gregory's career began in the late
1950's in Chicago, reaching success
after an audition with the Chicago
Plabyboy Club. Prior to that, he
had been working at a nightclub for
five dollars a night.

The travels which accompanied
his success led Gregory to become
deeply involved with social prob-
lems in this country. He has been
particularly active in the civil rights
movement, In 1963, he led a march
in Birmingham, and he devoted
much of his next two years to civil
rights work in the south,

In 1965, the comedian was in

to attend the weekly faculty pro
ceedings. Dean Edward Atwood said
two primary reasons were that the
faculty meetings sometimes bring up
students’ which are named
cases, and that allowing students
into faculty meetings could prove
embarassing for those named stu-
dents. The dean said faculty
members might be inhibited by stu-
dents.

Gregory turned his full attention
to social problems in 1967, when
he gave up all nightclub engage-
ments. Since then he has traveled
around the country devoting his time
to social criticism and speaking tours
at various college campuses. He now
works with a staff of 14 persons

to aid in research for his speeches.

Gregory will speak on March 5
in new Doremus Gymnasium. The
public and students are invited to
attend without charge.

Other speakers for this year’s

nounced in upcoming weeks. This

bring a variety of speakers to WA&l

OUTLOOK and REVIEW
Liberating The Faculty

A few weeks ago, in these very columns we tried to
liberate our faculty. More seriously, what we did was suggest
that faculty meetings be opened up, at least to some kind of
student purview.

Our general argument ran something like this: while the
EC admittedly wields control over student governmental
matters, and the University Council has power in the realm
of social regulations, still a good chunk of university policy,
particularly in the academic realm, lies with the faculty. Now,
we did not deny that students are amply represented on faculty
committees and we did not assert that students should have
voting or even floor power in matters of faculty jurisdiction.

But we merely wondered why the proceedings of the
faculty at large had to remain secret and insulated from the
students, particularly the student media.

Now since that editorial appeared, the issue has been
raised before two forums—first, before the University Coun-
cil and, secondly, before the Executive Committee. The result:
the UC voted 16-6 not to allow students at the faculty meet-
ings; the EC voted by a similar margin to recommend the
reverse.

Now, one obvious reason for the wide discrepancy of
judgment issuing from these two venerable bodies is that the
UC alone reflects, to some extent, the faculty point of view.
Just what, then, were these telling arguments which the
faculty representatives displayed before the UC?

Well, their general argument ran like this:

(1) Faculty meetings are, most of the time, really bor-
ing, and, therefore, the students don’t really want to know
what's going on.

(2) Allowing students at the faculty meeting would
pre-empt the function for which the University Council
was created, i.e., to discuss issues of mutual student-faculty
concern.

(3) Much of the business discussed at faculty sessions
involves personal cases, for which confidence should not be
broken.

(4) Journalistic accounts of the faculty proceedings
made by students would not necessarily be “objective.”

(5) Many faculty members would, somehow, feel “in-
hibited” with a student in the room.

Now, lined up and counted on authoritative faculty fingers,
these cases must have seemed pretty convincing. But are they?

First of all, to dismiss the faculty meetings as dull and
routine is not a case for closing them up. Come to think of
it, this whole campus, is, most of the time, pretty dull and
routine,

The second assertion, that the University Council would
in some manner, be undercut by opening up the faculty meet-
ings, seems downright evasive. The students are not asking
for further voice on faculty matters, just cognizance of these
matters and the arguments, pro and con, raised during the
meetings.

When individual cases are discussed, we heartily agree,
such information should not be for general consumption.
When the EC, for instance, must consider an Honor System
case or if the University Council reaches into an area con-
cerning a specific student, they go into closed session, The
agenda is arranged accordingly, and confidence is preserved.

The fourth argument is a little harder to understand, One
member of the administration said before the UC that an
“objective” account of a faculty meeting could not be assured
and that “anything important” that emerges from a faculty
meeting is announced to the students anyway, Now, we don’t
take offense at this lack of confidence in the student media—
that's unimportant. But we are a little concerned that certain
faculty members believe “objectivity” will be maintained by
their releasing whatever they think is important for the stu-
dents to know,

Finally, we don't understand why a faculty member should
feel “inhibited” before a student at a faculty meeting. Why
should he feel more restrained than a student on the EC or a
faculty member on the UC, both of whom presently say what
they have to say at meetings open to the press?

Though it may be inferred from our comments, we do not
claim that the faculty has something to hide or that the
administration is less than cooperative with the student media,
What is at issue, however, is the climate of trust which, we
are told, exists between students, faculty, and administration
at Washington and Lee.

One faculty member at the University Council offered a
rather interesting argument against opening faculty meet-
ings. He said that the proceedings would thereupon become
“merely an exercise . The decisions would all be made
behind closed doors,” As long as we're kept in the dark, we
students just can't be certain that that is not what is happen-

ing right now, N.E.P.

Doyon Speaks On Arts

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

After giving it much — serious
thought, it seems to me that in the
discussion held at the university
center on Wednesday, January 17,
concerning “the future of the fine
arts at Washington and Lee” we
got the wrong answers because we
were asking the wrong questions.
We concerned ourselves on how we
could make the art department
bigger when we should have asked
not only why we want it bigger
but how we can make it better. We
never questioned why and we quick-
ly accepted without reflection the
common fallacy that bigger is better.
(i, for one, have learned from ex-
perience that this is not always so.
I came from a large state univer-
sity with an art department more
than ten times the size of ours.
It was good, but not better than
ours. And our resources never met
our ever-increasing enrollment and
expectations. There, too, the student
“instant solution” called for more
faculty, more studio facilities, more
courses for art majors, more of the
same, Is this what we want at
Washington and Lee?)

Before there is any more discus-
sion on the future of the Art De-
partment, in word or in print, let us
review the educational goals and
obligations of a college the size of
Washington and Lee. We can do
this by reading carefully the “Philo-
sophy and Characteristics” of Wash-
ington and Lee clearly stated in our
catalogue from page 9 through 14.
(How many of our most vocal art
students calling for “special courses
for art majors only” have read it?

By J. JASON MATTHEWS

It has been five weeks since
Christmas vacation has ended and
the slight paunch developed because
of the extra food is gone, in its
place returns the familiar “starved
gerbil” look so popular with the
student “a la mode.” The well-
greased machinery of DUBYANEL
rolls on and you lay in the dust,
tread marks on your back, awed by
its amazing power.

You always think that the rest
you get from a couple of weeks at
home will give you enough energy

First of all, my dear, before I explain that I cou

I did before accepting a position at
Washington and Lee—every word
most carefully! I found myself in
complete agreement with its high
educational goals, and I still believe,
to quote this seldom-read passage,
that “the best educated man is the
liberally educated man”, page 10.)

For those who desire to prepare
for an art career, | strongly recom-
mend graduate school. In fact, even
if we succeeded in offering an art
program on the scale possible only
at the largest universities, further
study is indispensable. A four-year
degree in any field does not carry
much weight in today’s job market,
if a career is what is expected from
college. (Actually, trade schools are
more successful than four-year col-
leges in placing their trainees.) All
that a college of our size can be
expected to do is provide for quality
education through small classes and
individual attention, This we do well
but climbing enrollment in = art
classes has made this obligation in-
creasingly more difficult. (And, I
suspect, this is the cause of student
frustration wrongly vented upon
“the administration” or “the chair-
man” or some other easy target.)
Unless we are prepared to throw
millions into the art department
instantly, we can only do the best
we can with what we have.

But we can achieve our primary
goals with our present facilities if
we insist on the highest standards,
The art department will not be
bigger in the future but it will be
better. And by being better we will
have a better Washington and Lee.
Our students will be welcomed into
the best graduate schools. All of
us, administration, faculty, and stu-

Letters To The Editor...

dents really want nothing less from
Washington and Lee and should not
settle for anything less. If we can’t
be the biggest, let’s be the best!

I have arrived at these conclusions
not through “pressure” from anyone
but through the pressure of exist-
ing facts and figures revealed in the
Report of the Registrar distributed
to all the faculty. Art grades in some
courses are not realistic, to be sure.
More important, there is a gap be-
tween the ideals of a Washington
and Lee education and the type of
art education demanded by a vocal
few here. It is not possible to have
both at the same time in the near
future, if it is desirable at all,
What the art department does well
is what other departments do well,
We are no different and should not
be different. The Art Department is
an intregal part of ou rhigh quality
Washington and Lee liberal arts
education and should remain so.
I'm proud of it and will see to it
that I will always be proud of it.

agree with the position that we can
and should provide an education for
“underprivileged” minorities asks you
to go against many things that you
believe to be the case. It asks you
to believe that there is more to a

grades, It asks qou to go on “purely
subjective impressions,” that are
deemed as “unrealistic” by our edi-
tor. It asks you to take a chance.
A chance that might bring men

It might interest you to know that
in a recent survey of over 300
college teachers they picked motiva-

primary factor in college success.

The editor deemed it necessary to
delete some things from my last

necessary to establishing my point
about the inaccuracy of the present
admissions criteria. It is his right to
do so even at the expense of truth.

Look at grades, but be mind-
ful of the fact that they are not
the best indicator, Look at test
scores, knowing that they might not
be as accurate as you believe at
present. Then look at his rank in
class, but keep in mind the bias
that might be associated with that
position. The most important thing
should be to talk to him and find
out things about him or are you
also afraid?

RING-TUM PHI

    

Phi Sticks With Its Guns,
Rips Hapless LUR, 72-72

By PAUL SIMPSON

Last Friday night, in a rare dis-
play of outside shooting, the Ring-
tum Phi and WLUR-FM tied 72-72
in the first of their semi-annual
games. The last game between these
two rivals took place July 13 in
Doremus Gymnasium, As you all
remember, the Ring-tum Phi team
failed to show up. So the WLUR
team took the court and, after con-
trolling the opening tap, tried (un-
successfully) to score during the next
two minutes, Referee Norwood
“Skip” Paukert then blew the ball
dead and, invoking an obscure rule,
called the game on account of rain.

Shocked, the WLUR team was
quieted when Paukert showed them
the rule that allowed him to do
this. Unfortunately, they did not
notice that Pauckert was inadvert-

the WLUR team did not catch on
when, during their two minute
shooting spree, every fourth ball
that missed the basket, Paukert
would yell “Take your base.” Be-
cause of this, the game ended 0-0

in a state of bewilderment.

Palmer (or Palmer Trice as he has
come to be known) failed to show
because of a “business engagement.”
Reportedly, a man answering Trice’s
description made large bets on the
WLUR team.

The WLUR team was led by
Chet Burgess who, last year you
will remember, was voted MVP on
the winning WLUR team when he
convieniently ran into the scorer’s
table, giving the scorekeeper a mild
concussion and then volunteeering
to keep score himself the rest of
the game.

Matmen Win,
Host U.N.C.

By KEN RUSCIO

The Washington and Lee westling
team raised its record to 9-5 last
Saturday by defeating V.C.U. and
Campbell and losing to Pembroke
in a gruelling triple dual meet. It
was the second week in a row
that Coach Piper’s well-conditioned
team had successively endured such
an ordeal giving evidence that the
team is rapidly approaching peak
form in time for the upcoming
tournaments. Don Overdorff led the
way in the 118 class by posting
pins against Campbell and VCU
and gaining a clear decision over
his Pembroke opponent. In doing
so he upped his individual record
to 9-1-1, currently the best on the
team.

In the narrow win over VCU
(23-19), Lee Keck at 126 and Sam
Lewis at 177 gained key decisions,
Bill Melton’s (134) and Rolf Piran-
ian’s (142) draws preserved the
margin of victory. Lewis also ex-
celled in the Campbell win by pin-
ning his opponent. Also against
Campbell Doug Ford pinned giving
him the team lead for the season
with five. Jim Strieff, Rick Heldrick,
and Dan White added decisions to
make the final score 27-19. In los-
ing to a tough Pembroke squad the
Generals were only able to gain
four decisions—Overdorff, Melton,
Steir and Ford.

Hopes are high for W&L in the
all-important VCAA meet to be held
at Doremus Gymnasium on Febru-
ary 14. At the conference meet
(Feb. 23-24) the Generals will be
well represented by their most suc-
cessful team in memory. Coach
Piper is also planning to send his
top three wrestlers to the NCAA
college division championship — in
South Dakota. The team has given
every indication of continuing their
winning ways in the weeks ahead.

 

Everyone knew Billy. A day
rarely went by that he didn’t
in some way touch every athlete's
life who entered Doremus Gym.
From a “mere” wave before
practice to sneaking paddle ball
rackets to the cross country run-
ners, the little man in the equip
ment room was as much a part
of the athlete's lives as the sport
in which they participated. He
expected little in return for the
tasks he performed, merely the
pure enjoyment of watching foot-
ball or absorbing the activity of
a basketball game. He found
satisfaction in working at WA&l
and we're glad because we owed
Billy much more than we could
possibly return.

Billy Davis died a week ago
Monday of a heart attack at the
age of fifty-eight. Everyone who
know him will find it impossible
nol to miss him; he was someone
who, by the his gregarious nature.
was intensely involved in W&l
athletics and the athletes he so
generously helped.

Generals after the games this past
weekend. The Generals truly put
on impressive performances in
downing Bridgewater 82-56 and
Emory and Henry 70-55. The Gen-
erals look better with each per-
formance, and that’s a good sign
with only four more games on the
schedule before the C.A.C. Tourna-
ment February 22-24, at Sewanee.
Verne Canfield has done a good
job of developing and exploiting the
talent of this team. At times they
did not come on as quickly as he
thought they should have, but as
he said earlier this year after a
particularly bad stretch of games,
“I still have condfience in them.”
And finally all that confidence is
beginning to pay off.

Washington and Lee got off to a
roaring start on Friday night with
that impressive 26-point victory over
Bridgewater. Junior Skip Lichtfuss
turned in a truly impressive per-
formance, throwing shots in from
every conceivable spot and direc-
tion, and a few he made up for
the occasion, Lichifuss got 26 points
and 12 rebounds and was supported
by Bo Williams who got 12 points

ally effectively.

Washington and Lee opened the
game in a half-court press which
the Wasps never quite figured out,
even though they saw it for ex-
tensive portions of the game. The
Generals had great success with the
press as Clelan, Williams and Strain
consistently forced turnovers which
usually resulted in easy baskets at
the other end of the court. Bo
Williams got 10 of his 12 points in
the first half, primarily as a result

of the press. Paul MeClure’s stra-
tegic loss of a contact allowed WAL
a rest from their pressing efforis
about three-quarters of the way into
the first half. In addition to this

Swimmers Drown U of R

By CLIF OVERCASH

and JIMMY BAIRD
As a final tune-up for the upcom-
ing Virginia College Athletic As-
sociation state meet, the Washing
ton and Lee swim team handily de-
feated the University of Richmond,
65-47, last Saturday. The Generals,
obviously looking ahead to the
VCAA meet next weekend, wasted
no time in brushing off the Spiders.
Top performances included a new
school record for Bill Tiers in the
1,000 yard freestyle, first in the 50
yard freestyle and 200 yd. butterfly

freestyle. Other wins went to Alan
Corwith in the 500 yd. freestyle,
Steve Erickson in the 200 back-
stroke, and Billy Cogar in the 1 and
3 meter diving.

The Richmond contest gave all of
Coach Bill Sterans’ swimmers a
chance to participate, and several
responded admirably, Among them

were Mike Moore, Tom Koung,
Gary Seldmomridge, Alan  Petti-
grew, and John Henzel. After this
weekend's VCAA meet, the Gen-

into the

Mr. Editor, | enjoy your cute quips
at the end of my letters, they reveal
so much about you. However I
would appreciate it if you took the
time to inform the student body
about the issue in greater length.
Maybe it’s time that this issue
got off the second page and on to
the front. I have a question for
you: Who is the “we” that you
speak of with such authority, is it
the student body? Are you the
representative of this “we” that
knows minorities and realism so
well, or are you and the student
body one and the same?

My fellow students | have a gut
feeling about you, only you will be
able to resolve the recruitment situa-
tion. At present only a token effort
exists, whether it is allowed to con-
tinue rests entirely up to your re-
sponses to the administration.

forefront of the British cinema and

actor with great potential.

If... is set within the con-
fines of a posh English boarding
school that is collapsing under the
weight of its 1,000 year history.
It concerns the lives and rebellions
of three non-conforming students—
Mick, Johnny, and Wallace—who
mingle their blood in a ceremony
of solidarity.

Anderson once told Cloude
Delmas: “If... is not meant to
be a film that excites or agitates,
but I hope that the people will
understand it; this is why the di-
vision into chapters and, up to a
certain point, the use of black and
white and colour, are what Brecht
calls processes of distinction which
detach the spectator from his emo-
ms 4.

As the film gathers its momentum,
it makes the startling transition from
conventional public school drama to
guerrilla warfare. The three react

arbitrary punishment, wreaking

legs over the back of the next seat
at the Bolshoi if you are wearing a
long sheath dress? These problems
must be settled between you and
the people you associate with. The
Three Stooges gag of sitting on
someones lap while they are hold-
ing a plate of potato salad has gone
out of vogue.

(d) Facial Expression: Above all,

decorum and ennui must be the
keynote here. Even if you are seat-
ed next to the Indian Ambassador's
son who is suffering from choleric
catarrah, you must, at all costs,
feign indifference. Mild delight was
once acceptable but with the pass-
ing of Isadora Duncan, it is con-
sidered stilted.
(e) The Voice: The think this year
for voices is the Carmelita Pope
Whisper. Loud raucous yelling was
never really acceptable, and with
the advent of the communication
gap it becomes even less so. The
trick is to make the person you are
talking with think that maybe his
hearing is going. Mouthing every
20th word will be effective.

Advanced behavior is an elusive
concept. Staring at your partner
over the rim of a wine glass with-
out going cross-eyed, suggestive little
pressures of the hand withdrawn
before the cigarette can burn you,
working up to the good-night kiss
without stammering, all fall into
this category. These techniques can
only be perfected by many long
hours of practice with one of those
inflatable “Party Dolls” advertised
in the back of the Police Gazette.

Finally, the Big Apple, the Dam
Burster, the Goodnight Kiss. All
the care in the world must be taken
not to seem too anxious or nerv-
ous. Whining and whimpering are
dead giveaways so try to keep those
at a minimum. Many times a grip
around the waist can be applied
too tightly, and while this is an
effective method of snapping the
spine of a would-be mugger it usu-

ally dampens the ardour of a would-
be dater. If you happen to have
a cleft plate warn your partner
before you kiss, as the new sensa-
tion could induce vomiting. Finally,
don't feel at all embarrassed. Kiss-
ing is a natural, healthy way of
showing affection for another per-
son, much like grooming a horse
or shining a turtle’s shell.

Dating can be a wonderful ex-
perience. In this, the “springtime”
of our lives, nothing could be finer
than to stroll down a cherry blos-
som arbor, hand-in-hand with the
person you care for, perhaps sing-
ing a tune, or just listening to the
crickets chirp. Why deprive your-
self? Think of it this way, what

Generals Beat Bridgewate, E-H,
Prepare For CAC Tournament

(Continued from page 3)
General line-up, especially on the
boards kept E&H at a constant dis-
advantage. But the hustle began to
wane, Emory and Henry’s outside
shooting improved, and Licktfuss
picked up his fourth foul.

At this point the Wasps made
their only significant run of the
night at the Generals| But the Gen-
erals recovered enough to blunt the
thrust. Lichtfuss fouled out at 6:28
and soon afterwards both Paul Mc-
Clure and Gary Fitzgerald got into
foul trouble; each with four, Now
it was Verne Confield’s chance to
show off his bench, who if they
didn’t give an outstanding perform-
ance, certainly gave an extremely
steady one as they blunted the E&H
attack and finished the game going
away. In a capsule the game boiied
down to the superior play of W&L,
especially its defense, as opposed to

the outclassed Emory and Henry
team. The Generals showed team
play and balanced scoring in a well
deserved victory as they had four
men in double figures: Guy Kerr
with 13, Bowman Williams with 12,
and Lichtfuss and McClure with 10
each,

In addition to these two games,
Washington and Lee made a clean
sweep of the weekend by winning
both Frosh games. The freshmen
defeated Bridgewater 78-75 with
John Rice talleying 30 points, and
then finished the weekend and ex-
tending their record to 9-2 by de-
feating Massanutten 87-60, Wash-
ington and Lee basketball prospects
are taking a turn for the beter and
with the tournament coming up it
looks like a tough W&L team that’s
headed for Sewanee in search of
another CAC championship.

Phi Sticks With Its Guns

(Continued from page 3)

Seriously though, Warren Davis
was excellent for the Phi (even
though no one can remember when
he last wrote for them) and Don
Eavenson played well for WLUR
(even though he didn't know W&L
had a radio station.)

But who could forget the cli-
mactic ending that will be remem-
bered for years to come! As Paul
Cavaliere (who had a good game
for the Phi) brought the ball up
the court, Wayne “Hot Tip” Baker
charged off the bench bowling
Cavaliere over, saying something to
the effect that “it’s my ball and
you can’t play with it any more
‘cause I'm going home.”

After Baker was quieted and the
ball retrieved, Cavaliere went to the
foul line for what could be the
winning shot (there were only 20
seconds left). About the same time,
a middle-aged lady made her way
through the crowd and appeared
under the basket asking “the funny
lithe man in the striped shirt (ob-
viously a reference to Keefe) to
move so I can take a picture.”

By the time the referees had re-
moved her, the continuous run-

Despite this blood-curdling support,
however, there is no male passion,

like a heavy wrench that terrorizes

convincing, middling, flaccid,

As the play unzips (for it is a
drama of the phallus) Kowalski the

The program proclaims that this
is to be a new interpretation of the

up the ladder of evolution. Rieger's

ARefrain of Dem Old Coed Blues

It was decreed several weeks ago that, come Spring, we
students would have another opportunity to express our
opinions on coeducation for Washington and Lee. As all
but the freshmen will recall, the coed proposal fell to defeat
by a two-to-one margin in last year’s student body poll; many
opponents of the idea thereupon pronounced the issue dead
and all but buried.

As it turns out, however, the coeducation controversy is
not dead—merely dormant. This should come as no surprise,
for a couple of reasons, First, coeducation is still a strong
trend for institutions nationally, and such trends are not
dispelled by a single poll. Secondly, in this particular winter
of student discontent, it seems natural that the issue would
be resurrected; certainly, basic conditions haven't altered so
as to lead last year’s advocates of coeducation to abandon
their cause.

Most of us are already familiar with the arguments, both
pro and con, Last year a great deal of talk and energy was
expended on the topic; a special faculty subcommittee, headed
by Dr. Louis Hodges, presented a comprehensive report,
culled from a great deal of assiduous research, Many students
became intellectually and emotionally caught up with the
issue. All this oceurred—only to be deflated by the Spring
referendum results.

Before we embark on a replay of these efforts, several
points should be remembered. First, Washington and Lee is
fortunate in not being forced to make a decision about co-
education under pressure, Other colleges (Sewanee and David-
son come to mind) have found coeducation to be tied with
their future existence as competitive institutions; there is no
hard evidence to indicate that Washington and Lee is, or
will be, in this predicament. \dmissions standards, it seems,
will be more or less maintained, since numbers of applicants
have been steadily rising.

On the other hand, the fact that W&L does not face an
academic necessity to go coed is not, in itself, an argument
against going coed. In other words, the real strength of the
pro-coeducation position is not that W&L needs girls to assure
financial and academic stability; it is, rather, that coeducation
would bring a highly desirable qualitative change in W&L.

And this dichotomy, let's face it, is what the whole issue
boils down to—at least, in most students’ minds. There are
those, including most fraternity men, who are probably quite
happy, thank you very much, with the traditional all-male
lifestyle. They would prefer to be able to call the shots as to
when women are to be around and when they are not.

There is the other group which is basically bored with the
old down-the-road game; they feel that the campus would
profit, socially and intellectually, by the pressure of a feminine
contingent.

This is not meant to discount two other quite valid argu-
ments against coeducation: (a) that the change might mean
a larger enrollment and (b) that it would probably mean
considerable and amendation of the curriculum. We
suspect, though, that present size could be essentially sus-
tained and that the requisite financial adjustments could be
absorbed, if W&L students really wanted to take the plunge.

But what we're talking about is a very basic change in the
character of a Washington and Lee education, and the dil-
lemma is a tough one. There is no reason why W&L should

cost

pop up with me-tooism every time a hot and fashionable topic
comes along. Indeed, the case can very well be made that
W&L should remain as an all-male alternative in the quality-
college market.

Still, other institutions, similarly not under the gun, have
gone ahead with plans to open their doors to females. Dart-
mouth, Yale, and Harvard did not go coed because of admis-
sions problems; they had other, more encompossing reasons.
lt is a fact that here at W&L we are plagued with a rather
high attrition rate. Only some 63% of those who enroll as
freshmen ever go on to receive a degree——and, according to
many students who have considered transferring, W&L’s all
male status is a frequent and major reason.

The reckoning will come, then, this Spring, and if there is
no change in the student vote, the coeducation issue, in all
likelihood, will be put to rest for a good while longer, Mean-
while, it won't hurt to think about and discuss the subject,
intelligently and honestly, amongst ourselves, This may mean
re-hashing old arguments, but the issue is compelling enough,
we believe, to deserve the effort.

Independent Exams: An Assessment

By ROB GURNEE

With the new 12-12-6 calendar in
1970 came independent exams, and
the popularity of the system is ap-
parently still on the rise. In a recent
poll taken by the EC, the Washing-
ton and Lee community voted over-
whelmingly in favor of the present
independent scheduling system.

Since the poll, many students have
expressed curiosity as to the position
of the faculty and administration in
regard to this issue. So this past
week, the Ring-tum Phi talked with
several members of the faculty and
administration to determine how the
system originated and the past and
present sentiments of the faculty re-
garding the current exam plan.

In the winter of 1970, the Stu-
dent Curriculum Committee present-
ed an exam plan they thought would
fit well into the new calendar system
for the 1970-71 school year. The
exam plan was submitted to the fac-
ulty Executive Committee for re-
view, and the committee rejected
the proposal. The administration
then contacted seevral other schools
which had independent exams to de-
termine whether they were success-
ful. During that time the Student
Curriculum Committee revised the
exam plan and resumbitted it to the
faculty EC. This time the plan was
adopted,

We talked with Dr. Louis Hodges,
professor of religion and a member
of the 1970 faculty EC.

“Il originally had serious doubts
about independent exams,” said Dr,
Hodges. “Certainly it puts a greater
burden on the student—the oppor
tunity for cheating is greater.

“From a faculty viewpoint, in
many cases independent exams make
the grading process more difficulty,”
cominued Hodges. “Many of us
don't like to grade any of the exams
until they all are received for rea-
sons of greater objectivity. When
exams come floating in all week, it
puts quite a rush on us to grade the
papers and submit the grades within
a couple of days.

“IT think, however, that the system
as it is is working out quite well, If
a vote were taken today probably
65 to 75% of the faculty would
favor the current system,’

Dr. William Jenks, professor of

history, also opposed independent
exams at first
“A sysiem such as this has the

best chance to work in a close-knit
college community where students
live. eat, and owe allegiance to each

other. A sense of trust is cultivated
if an environment such as that of
Sweet Briar.” said Dr. Jenks

Many students feel that WA&l
breeds such a trust. Junior Tom
Faulkner would like to see even
greater freedom during the exam

perind

“The exam period would be better
if the students could take exams any
time during the week without being
bound by a signed exam folder.
Also I see no reason why a student
can't take his exam where he desires.
The opportunity to cheat is present
with the current system and those
who would cheat will do it anyway.”

The great majority of students
favor a reading day before the exam
period and we talked with Assistant
Dean Robert McAhren about that
possibility.

“As you know, a reading day is
scheduled before the winter exams,
but the time factor forbids the extra
day before the Christmas holidays.
So if the student needs a reading day
he has the freedom of leaving the
first day of exams open on his sche-
dule.”

McAhren continued, “Il am pleased
with the way the independent exam

Is Doremus for Students?

lo the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

As one of the many Washington
and Lee students who like to use
Doremus Gym on the weekends, I
feel that it is time to raise a com-
plaint. Two weeks ago, on a Sat-
urday afternoon, there were around
forty people playing basketball in
the old gym when Coach Miller in-
formed us that we would have to

leave because a girls’ gymnastics
meet was scheduled for that after-
noon,

It just so happened that a wrest
ling maich was in progress in the
new gym, so we had nowhere to go,
li seems to me that this is a very
good example of very poor planning.
| was under the impression that one
reason the new gym was built was
so that the entire student body could
use the facilities to a greater extent
than in the past. | am all for making
the gym available to the Lexington
community for its needs, but on a
Saturday afternoon when the other
gym is already in use?

| would suggest that the athletic
department either take a little more
consideration for the students
when it decides to reserve an entire
gym for outside groups, or that it
find some place other than a main
gym to conduct girls gymnastics
meets. Is this any way fo run a gym

system has gone. Certainly it avoids
test conflicts that were present with
the block exam system. The burden,
however, is not with the administra-
tion, but with the student. The suc-
cess or failure of independent exams
depends on the respect that the stu-
dents have for the system and them-
selves.”

Just what is the student's burden?
We talked with past Student Body
Presidents Fran Lawrence and Steve
Robinson and the current President
Bob Brennan, all of whom suggested
that independent exams are unique
in relation to the honor system.

“With the exams,” said Brennan,
“the responsibility of the student
doesn't end when he walks out of the
test. Instead the biggest responsibil-
ity is still on his shoulders. Complete
silence is the only way to handle in-
dependent exams.”

ing among the faculty, adminisira-

elsewhere on campus, regarding
minority student recruitment. My in-
terest is in the larger context of the
question of how Washington and
Lee will adapt as an educational in-
stitution to the 1970's,

In an article entitled “The New
Change magazine (Feb.
1973) suggests that higher education
in this decade will be shaped to a
large extent by a new clientele of
students, The article defines
“New Students” as coming from one
of four “distinctive but overlapping
groups: 1.) low

open admissions; 2.) adults and part
time learners who are gaining access
through nontraditional

E.C, member Bob Keatley sug-
“Value judgments (i.e. the
test was hard, or the test was easy)
given out after a test are the E.C,'s
greatest concern. It can be just as
damaging for a student to give out
this information as it is to openly
cheat on an examination.”

Everyone seems to be adjusting
well to our current system on inde-
pendent exams, Almost all faculty
members agreed that they were
pleased with the way the last exam
period went. Many students com-
mented that the independent exam
system was one of the main attrac-
tions leading to their enrollment here
at W&L.

Dr. Hodges said it best when he
commented, “The chances for the
continued success rest with the stu-
dents. They can respect it and make

Concert In Review

Preston Sounds Off

By W. PATRICK HINELY

The only formal wear to be seen
in Doremus Gym last Friday night
was worn by Buz King, drummer for
“Daddy Rabbit,” the opening act of
the Dance Board's Fancy Dress con-
cert. So it ain't what it used to be.
But, as Billy Preston would say,
“that’s the way God planned it.”

Daddy Rabbit is made up of five
students, four of them from W&L.
Their playing shows proficiency and
knowledge of their limitations, and
a good bit of versatility as well, On
one of their final numbers, Daddy
Rabbit pulled off a stunt | haven't
heard anyone else but the Jefferson
Airplane do successfully, This is a
way of having each member of the
band head off in a different direc-
tion until the sound is more like
noise than music, also known as
“chaos,” and then snapping every-
one back into a unified structure
once again.

Overall, Daddy Rabbit was an im-
pressive opening act.

Billy Preston, when he finally got
on stage, was ready to go, and he
did. Preston is a showman from the
word go, and his abilities as a musi-
cian are not lacking, at least on key-
boards,

Preston played a wide variety of
material, but everything he did had
the same underlying spirit, which
would be something like, “We're all
God's children, so let’s rock ‘n’ roll
tonight.”

Maybe it’s the way he moved

whatever it was, it put the audience

Maybe any more concerts like that

Preston had a certain combina-

plain movement which allowed him
to change styles freely, and yet seem
to be continuing what he had just
finished doing. His backup band was
just that: secondary support, but
essential nevertheless, With their
rhythm driving underneath, Preston
didn’t have as far to climb to pass
that critical point a concert artist
must surpass to get himself and the
audience off.

He probably could have done it
with just an acoustic piano, but it

violence, and Ludwig van Beetho-
ven. Yet Kubrick’s handling of each
of these elements makes A Clock-
work Orange, in this writer’s opi-
nion, a rather unique film,

Malcolm McDowell turns in an
extremely credible performance as
Alex, a character who is the very
personification of evil, yet a person
portraying great candor, wit, and
intelligence: winning qualities which
would seem to invite the viewer's
sympathy, But Kubrick stops there,
giving the viewer a character who is
totally aware of his own wickedness
and making no attempt to deceive
the audience as to his corruption.

Alex and his band of droogies
prey upon other gangs and the pub-
lic, deriving immense pleasure
through their own stylized form of
violence. One of the more unique—
and one of the more violent—scenes
in the film concerns a danse macab-
re of sorts involving the confronta-
tion of Alex and his band and an-
other gang in a ballet of bloodshed.
The scene is edited in such a way
that each thrust of a club, each kick
in the groin, coincides perfectly with
the beat of Beethoven's Ninth. The
twist is such that the viewer is im-
pressed by the brutality of Alex and
his droogies while the actual flow
of blood is conspicuously absent.

Alex and his band go on to per-

petuate their image, entering the
home of a political activist under

false pretenses, doing bodily harm
to the household head and raping
his wife, all choregraphed to the tune
of “Singing in the Rain.” Again, a
different, and, I think, unique twist.
(Kubrick handles another interim
scene after a similar fashion where
Alex has intercourse with two girls

picked up in a Chelsa Drugstroe

filmed in pixilation and to the rhy
thm of Rossini’s William Tell Over-
ture.) Under the same false pre
tenses which gained him entry to
the home of the activist, Alex is ad
mitted into the home of The Cat

Woman, This time he is betrayed by
his droogies and is captured by the
police. Told by his
ficer that he has run out of excuses,

probation of
is sent off to prison

It is at prison that Alex
teers for the Ludovico ‘Treatment.
Seeing it as a way out of his pre
dicament, Alex willingly
himself to the behaviorist’s theory
of stimulus-response and is extin
guished through films depicting rape
violence and Beethoven. Herein lies
the depreviation of choice: Alex is
conditioned in such a that
he has neither the choice to be good
nor evil. He than
human: an orange, organic, but act-
ing like clockwork: restrained, but
not redeemed.

here are two other
the film which attention
Phe first is set design. While the film
is Situated in London and much use
is made of city locations, the
themselves lend a futuristic tone to
the film. The viewer is impressed
with the present and future implica
tions of the environment. The second
is the sound track. The music of
Beethoven with the added dimension
of Walter Carlos, innovator of the
Moog Synthesizer, leaves the listen
er with a sense of past and present

As a result, the implication is
frightening. The viewer would prefer
to believe that the situation of Alex
is too far into the future to demand
immediate concern. Yet, the student
of psychology knows that “a clock
work orange,” in the Skinnerian
sense, is old hat. The penetration of
the brain by electrodes is the cur-
rent thing.

Doremus Plaques Honor

Dom Flora and Cy Young

By PAUL SIMPSON

After W&L’s victory over Bridge-
water two weeks ago, the ma-
jority of spectators walked past a
wall with numerous plaques adorn-
ing it. Very few, if any, stopped to
look at them, Although most of the
awards are for lacrosse (which is
undoubtedly THE sport at W&L),
two of the non-lacrosse awards
honor athletes whose feats might
surprise a lot of people.

One is a basketball award given
to Dom Flora when he was named
to the ten man All-American team
in 1958. As the all time W&L scor-
ing leader, in 1958 he became the
fifth highest scorer ever in the na-
tion’s history.

A 6'2” guard, he was one of the
last’ W&L men to receive a full
athletic scholarship for any sport,
He constantly drew praises from
opposing coaches and his lowest
game as a senior was seventeen
points,

Consistency was one of Flora’s
main attributes and this led to his
being named an All-American. On
the first team with him were Elgin
Baylor, Oscar Robertson, Bob
Boozer and Wilt Chamberlain, Flora
beat out another guard for the
first team position who many con-
sider to be a pretty good ball player,
Jerry West.

the athletic department to succeed,

About the same time that Dom
Flora was tearing up the hardwood
courts in Doremus Gymnasium, the
man serving as alumni secretary
was named Harry K. (Cy) Young,

Young was probably the greatest
all-around athlete W&L has ever
seen, The plaque on which you
can find his name is the one given
when he was inducted into the Na-
tional Football Hall of Fame (in
1958),

From 1913-17, “Cy” Young won
sixteen letters (four in each of four
sports: baseball, football, basketball
and track) and captained each team
he was on,

In baseball, “Cy” was the leading
hitter, scorer and base stealer. In
track he ran the 100 yard dash in
9.8 seconds. In basketball he was
twice All-Athletic Foundation All-
American team and led the team to
an undefeated season in 1917.

Best known for his football feats,
“Cy” was a halfback until an in-
jury forced him into the quarter-
back position. At this time, W&L
was playing Army, Navy, Cornell,
etc., the nation’s powerhouses,

Even so, in 1914, “Cy” led the
team to a 9-0 record and in 1913
he anchored the best defense in the
nation (allowing 9 points all year)
and the fourth best offense nation-
ally,

B’Ballers Stay Even;
Tigers Loom Ahead

By JIM MOZINGO

The W&L Generals managed to
keep their record above .500 this
past week, losing to Lynchburg 91-
82 and beating York 84-67. It was
one of the Generals’ easiest sched-
ules, with the Shippensburg game
cancelled.

Coach Verne Canfield isn't really
pleased with the week lay-off be-
tween games, especially considering
the foe Saturday night is Hampden-
Sydney, looking for revenge after an
early season defeat at the hands of
the Generals.

The games this past week afforded
quite a contrast. The game at
Lynchburg was close and well offici-
ated, and Lynchburg, though they
didn't show it much of the game,
has a good ball club.

On the other hand, the game at
York was under poor playing condi-
tions, poorly officiated, and the op-
position left something to be de-
sired. W&L shot 32% and _ still
won by 17 points,

Lynchburg put up a great fight,
though the game wasn't particularly
well played by either team. Regula-
tion time ended with the game tied
78-78. W&L had been bothered by
the Lynchburg press throughout the
game, and had trouble all night
getting the ball in the hoop. The
concensus seems to be that we
should have won the game in regula-
tion time, but in the overtime it was
all LC, as they outscored W&L
13-4,

The Generals returned to the court

Saturday night against York Col-
lege. Unfortunately someone had
left the covers on the baskets and
the Generals continued their hor-
rendous shooting streak, There were
several bright spots however; Skip
Lichtfuss managed to pry open the
nets for 28 points while also pull-
ing down 14 rebounds, But the real
rebounding show was put on by
Guy Kerr and Paul McClure who
got 17 each. These three accounted
for 48 rebounds, and allowed W&L
to dominate the boards. The only
problem here seems to be the num-
ber of rebounds coming off.

With his 28 points Saturday, Skip
Lichtfuss moved to within 17 points
of 1,000 for his career at W&L.
Skip could get them Saturday against
Hampden-Sydney.

Washington and
to its final regular season game

the scourge of the rest of the CAC,
Sewanee is 16-4 and coming off a
50 point victory over Southwestern.
They have already defeated Centre
three times, the fewest by 15 points.
Sawanee is the team to watch for
in the tournament; they should pose
the chief obstacle to W&L hopes.

Sewanee has an added advant-
age—they are playing in their own
gym. Canfield has been able to
play his whole bench the last couple
of weeks which should help, not
only for the tournament, but for
next year. The bench has encount-

W&L “Robinhood” Shoots For Olympics

By JAMES BAIRD

Mark Miller is not your ordinary
freshman. He is a national champion
in the relatively unknown sport of
archery. Once necessary for survival
in the wilds, the bow and arrow is a
familiar sight from summer camp
days, but many would not recognize
the equipment the competitive archer
uses today.

Archery, as a sport, has only re-
cently begun to gain popularity in
the United States, however, it is
now possible for an athlete to gain
all-American recognition in it. This,
among other things, is one of the
goals Mark has set for himself. In
May of 1972, he entered the Na-
tional high school championships
representing the state of Wisconsin.
He competed in the boys division
and the international round division
and captured both titles with new
records in each.

From that victory, which Mark
feels was his greatest accomplish-
ment, he went on to the Olympic
trials in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Wis-
consin, and Minnesota. The Olympic
committee picks a select field of
30 from all those who compete in
the trials and these 30 all meet
at Miami of Ohio for an elimina-
tion tournament, Out of this comes
three people who represent the

* * * *

U.S. at the Olypics. Mark didn’t
quite make it that far, but the
thought of representing the U.S. did
capture his imagination, and hope-
fully he plans for another try in
1976.

In a week's time, Mark shot in
one Olympic qualifier, the Men's
National Championship at Miami of
Ohio where he finished in the top
10%, and in the Wisconsin state
championship where he finished
fourth individually and won the team
championship.

Needless to say, it was a tough,
grueling week. Archery competition
is divided into indoor and outdoor
meets. Indoors, the archer will shoot
10 arrows from 20 yards in what
is called a PAA round, Outdoors,
where most international competi-
tion is shot, is more difficult. The
archer shoots 144 arrows in what
is called a F.1.T.A. round. Thirty-
six arrows are shot at 90 meters,
36 at 70 meters, 36 at SO meters,
and at 30 meters, These are timed
events. The competitor is given 2.5
minutes to shoot three arrows, When
he has completed shooting, he sits
down and the next competitor is

given 2.5 minutes to shoot three
arrows. When he has completed

shooting, he sits down and the next
competitor starts his timed shooting.

When competing indoors, Mark
is shooting at a target 22 inches in
diameter with a 3.2” bulls eye. On
the outdoor ranges shooting from
distances of 90 and 70 meters the
target is 48 inches in diameter with
a 9 inch bulls eye. From 50 to 30
meters the target is 34 inches in
diameter.

The pressure is intense. In inter-
national competition Mark says,
“one bad arrow can blow it all.”
Constant practice is necessary to
keep the body in shape and the eye
sharp. Equpiment must also be of
the highest quality. Mark uses a
Hoyt Pro medalist bow equipped
with stabilizer rods, counter balance
and sight with extension. His ar-
rows, which sell for about $50 a
dozen are fashioned from aluminum
and are equipped with feathers for
indoor shooting or plastic vanes for
outdoor shooting. They are 27”
long. Mark's bows cost him in the
neighborhood of $260 each with-

When Mark came to Washington
and Lee, it was primarily for the
academics. Many schools, recogniz-
ing his talent, offered scholarships
and other benefits in order to get
him to represent their school. Mark
considered them all and decided that
WAL would suit him best.

Letters to the athletic director
followed, where Mark explained his
desire to continue to compete in
archery competition representing
Washington and Lee. In effect, he
would be the school's archery team.
The return letters were enthusiastic;
the school would provide a place to
shoot and the necessary facilities.
Mark didn't ask for much. He would
provide his own targets, he had his
own equipment, and he would mark
off the necessary distances by him-
self. All that was needed were a
few bales of hay and a place to

Tankers Capture First VCAA;
Tough State Meet Lies Ahead

The Washington and Lee swim
team wrapped up its first state cham-
pionship on Saturday, with a re-
sounding victory in the first annual
VCAA_ championships. The _ final
score is still being contested, but as
it stands, the Generals outdistanced
their nearest opponent by 100 points,

 

The Blue swimmers march toward their showdown

Their closest competitor was Lynch-
burg College, who had &4 points, to
WA&L’s 185. Roanoke had 47 points,
Randolph-Macon had 33, and Hamp-
ton Institute had 22,

The meet was never close, for as

ards of the Yellow Jackets was the
only triple winner. He grabbed the
50, and 100, and the 200 freestyles.
W&L had several dual winners. John
Henzel won the 100 and 200 butter-
fly, Bill Tiers won the 500 and the
1650 freestyle, and Rob Searles ap-
parently won the 400 Individual
medley and the 100 backstroke. By
apparently, we mean he did swim and
win the races, but the VCAA might
disqualify him because he had been
disqualified in another meet.

With this first state championship
under their belts, the swimmers will
go after the big one this weekend in
Charlottesville. The small college
champs will try to knock off the
“big boys” in the overall state meet.

tain two gallons.

After removing from the fire and
allowing to cool a little add a half
cake dissolved yeast to lukewarm
mixture. Mix and strain into a five-
gallon crock. Allow it to ferment in
a cool place three days. At the end
of this period skim the mixture and
siphon into two dozen beer bottles.
Store bottles on their sides for at
least a week. Longer aging improves
the flavor and the quality of the
drunk which must follow for full
enjoyment,

Beer can be bought at innumer-
able establishments in the hamlet
which proves that you really can
buy happiness, even in Lexington.
Bottled bliss is distributed in the
greatest quantity at the Quid,

Korger, A&P, and East Lexington
Grocery. Old Mil and PBR
are $1.49 at Kroger, $1.34 at A&P.
and $1.39 at Bast Lex. Duck's
prices are just a little higher than
the highest of these. He charges
$1.60 for a six of Old Mil, the same
kind sold for a dime less at Kroger
and 20c-25¢ cheaper at the other
two stores named,

Whatever else you plan to under-
take this term, do cultivate your
relationship with a six pack of brew.
You will certainly find it to be one
of your most rewarding and memor-
able college experiences. So take
your fill of good cheer and good
beer and remember, as the obscure
Stanlicus said, “he who drinks a
brew a day will live to die some
other way.”

freshman Rick Heldrich gave W&L
the lead for good as he completely
dominated Loyola's Kevin Corker
in the last two periods to post a
4-0 decision,

Doug Ford (167) wasted no time
in his match pinning his man mid-
way through the first period to be-
come the second General to win
ten matches (Stieff was the first
when he won earlier in the after-
noon). Sam Lewis then gave W&L
a comfortable lead when he de-
cisioned his man 5-2 to up the team
score to 21-10. About this time
Coach Piper was undoubtedly think-
ing about last year’s match with

this same Loyola team when with
W&L leading 22-10 with two
matches to go, Loyola won the
final contests on pins to salvage a
tie.

Lanny Rainey (190) set his coach's
mind at ease when he pushed his
man all over the mat for a period
and a half (running up a 14-2
score) before pinning his man. This
clinched the match for the Generals
and removed all pressure from Dave
Powers who lost a decision to close

number of “high risk” students, i.e.
students who in their College Board
scores and past grades offer no guar-

But if we do so, we must either
add on new remedial programs to
our curriculum or make the curri-

student who does not have a quality

shoot.

Since Mark has been here he has
competed in one tournament and
before it he had only one day to
practice. The school had given him
permission to use the field adjacent
to the soccer fields, but the bales
of hay were late in coming. They
were eventually set up one day
before the tournament and Mark
had little time to prepare for the
meet. His showing was not too bad
considering these conditions,

After the Christmas break, the
hay disappeared and the Athletic
Department has taken an exhorbi-
tant time to produce more. Some
were actually set up this Monday,
but this hardly seems the way to
treat this type of talent. Mark has
no coach here at W&L. Coach Dick
Miller signs the necessary forms
and papers which Mark needs to
compete, but that is al Ithe help
he normally gets.

Perhaps abuse is
Perhaps W&L's lack of response
comes from a misunderstanding.
However, Washington and Lee
stands to lose a potential Olympic
competitior, unless a more favor-
able atmosphere is generated.

The United States Intercollegiate
Championship will be held in Penn-
sylvania in May. The all-American
team will be chosen from this

ing, melting, like mournful blues in-
to a tonality of tears,

Martha Evans, as slender and
bright as Sunday morning sunlight
through swooning curtain, is a cap-
able Stella, sex-mesmerized and
stuffed with dreaminess after pas-
sion, demon-eyed in anger at her
husband’s mistreatment of Blanche,
yet ultimately servile to sense.
Quite nimble for a pregnant woman,
Stella fairly dribbled that belly
along with her on sprints in search
of outrage.

Mark Daughtrey is a disappoint-
ment. His protrayal of Mitch, the
mama's boy who reaches first to
comfort, then to rape the haggard
Blanche, is a diminishing solidity.
His early scenes as the gawky but
eager cavalier with slumping should-
ers and pocket-protected hands are
efficacious. But when Blanche dis-
closes her responsibility for the death
of her boy-husband, Daughtrey
stares at her like a street lamp.
There also seemed to be a problem
of positioning, for Mrs. Kahn, after
a truly stirring confession, was fore-
ed to hop-wallow like an amputee
into Mitch’s sealing arms, (Indeed,
the entire play was characterized by
the performers’ inability to embrace
or rape naturally.)

After Stanley cleaves Blanche’s
past into a sordid cross-section for
Mitch, the spart-parts man rushes
to her to vent his wrath in the Ko-
walski manner. Daughtrey infects
the scene with ruinous slapstick,
rubber-legged, Groucho Marx strid-
ing, epileptic torso-twitching, and a
hollow, metallic voice, spitoon-
toned,

One does not feel the power of
desire from this production, the need
to grind flesh to flesh in frantic
endeavor to fill the emptiness where
there is no love. Without human
passion, desperate to stall the in-

Poet Dickey To Speak
In Contact Symposium

One of the South's most promi-
nent poets and men of letters,
James Dickey, will read and com-
ment on his works to highlights this
year’s ‘Contact’ symposium, Dickey
will appear in Lee Chapel on Fri-
day, March 2, at 8 p.m.

Dickey is perhaps most widely
known for his best selling novel,
Deliverance, a recounting the ad-

ventures of four Atlanta business-
men searching for their manhood
on a wild river canoe trip. The
film version, starring Jon Voight
and Burt Reynolds, with a sereen-
play by Dickey, has been a tre-
mendous box office success, It was

recently nominated for two Academy
Awards, including Best Picture.

Before, Deliverance, Dickey was
primarily known as a poet and lit-
erary critic, Considered by some to
be America’s finest poet, he re-
ceived the National Book Award for
Poetry in 1966 for a collection en-
titled Buckdancer’s Choice. Shortly
after that Dickey was appointed
Consultant on Poetry in English to
the Library of Congress; currently,
he is writer-in-residence at the Uni-
versity of South Carolina,

A native of Atlanta, Georgia,
Dickey began his writing career
while in the Air Force in World

War Il. After the war, he went to
Vanderbilt University and worked
with Robert Penn Warren, In the
fifties, he mixed teaching and ad-

vertising careers, while writing in his

spare time.

After publishing two books of
poetry, Dickey decided to turn to
verse full-time. Since then he has

produced three volumes of poetry,
three books of criticism, and De-
liverance,

Dickey’s last visit to Washington
and Lee was sponsored under the
auspices of the Glasgow Endow-
ment,

Other participants in this year’s
‘Contact’ include: former McGov-
campaign aide Frank Man-
kiewicz, comedian and social critic
Dick Gregory, feminist Betty
Friedan, and FBI Director L, Pat-
rick Gray,

Monday, Virginia State Senator
Lawrence Wilder spoke in Lee
Chapel on “How Blacks Can Sur-

vive in White United States.” In
his speech, the Virginia legislator
noted that blacks “are still psycholo-
gically and economically slaves in
our own homeland,”

Wilder indicated a need in our
society for more quality black pro-
fessors and professionals to “instill
and impart the zeal and zest needed
to realize black goals,”

Wilder said that though he is
an optimist in regards to black ad-
vancement, he is aware of the
continued frustration of blacks in
the face of continued white indif-
ference,

Fewer than 50 persons attended
the Wilder speech, which was held
on the second day of Black Culture
Week.

Concerts were held Sunday and
Tuesday nights as a part of Black
Culture Week, featuring “Black

The Curriculum Committee had

Marsh also said the Curriculum
Committee had made the sugges-

opened to all students and not
just those committed to military
duty.

The Cold Cheek Committee re-
ported they had plenty of money
but apparently no authority among
students,

Ted Blain said the committee was
having trouble getting students to
come to their meetings and pay
their fines.

Blain also said the commitiee was

about to implement a program of
blacklisting recurrent violators by
giving merchants a list of their
names and disavowing any responsi-
bility for their checks. However, he
noted a lack of interest among
merchants and the University.

Bozell Attacks
Supreme Court

Abortion Stand

“To treat life as a
venience is rooted
American culture and
self in our

social con-
deep in the
manifests it-
nation’s laws.”

This was the observation of L.
Brent Bozell, editor of the conserva-
tive Catholic magazine Triumph, in
a speech presented at Washington
and Lee University Monday night.
He was making reference to the
recent decision of the U. S, Supreme
Court on the question of abortion.

Bozell said that many of the
organizations who are said to main-
tain the high character of the
American culture have come out
with a pro-abortion stand, He said
some of these were the American
Medical Association, the American
Bar Association and other conserva-
tive organizations. In reference to
the last group, he pointed to Senator
John Tower and Senator Barry
Goldwater as conservatives favor
ing abortion,

Bozell said the question of abor-
tion, contraceptives and sex should
be viewed in the context of the
teachings of Jesus Christ. He
cluded with the observation

con-
“God's
laws must be followed before man’s
laws.”

The speech was preceded by a

film “The Reality of Abortion”, It
supported the belief that life does
begin in the fetal stage and that

many aborted fetuses have actually
survived.

Bozell's speech and the film were
sponsored by the Washington and
Lee Chapter of Young Americans
for Freedom. That group is attempt-
ing to bring pressure on the At-

torney Generals of Texas and
Georgia to Appeal the Supreme
ruling which overturned the anti-

abortion statutes of those states,

Bozell gave the speech follow-
ing a YAF banquet held in Evan's
Dining Hall Monday. The speaker
is a former editor of National Re-
view and co-authored MeCarthy
and His Friends with his brother-
in-law, William F, Buckley, Jr. He
is a graduate of Yale and the Yale
law school,

THE RING-TUM PHI

Wanna Buy Some Used Books?

Isn't it strange how, for a few changes in the colors of

Page 2

 

the graphs, the latest edition of your economics textbook
costs two dollars more than the previous edition did last year?

And how about your American history textbook which is
three dollars higher than last year’s text, and the only change
is the addition of a chapter on “The New Frontier” (which
your professor will never get around to discussing anyway) ?

In an attempt to combat the rising costs of college texts,
student Ben Sherman has proposed a system of selling second-
hand textbooks in the University Supply Store.

Noting that a wholesaler comes to the W&L campus each
Spring and buys back used texts at standard prices, Sherman
asks: why the Supply Store couldn’t do the same, buying
the books at the same rate and then selling them on its
shelves alongside new copies of the same text, but at lower
prices?

There are certainly several valid reasons for the inaugura-
tion of such a program, including the aid this service would
be to students desiring to buy or sell used texts. Students
would no longer have to hunt down old texts (if they wish
to save a substantial amount of money) via the wind-whipped
and illegible notices posted on bulletin boards around the
university.

The buyer would be aided because he would find used
texts in all the courses in which he is enrolled all at one
convenient location. And the price of these used texts would
be lower than that of the new copies of the same text, with the
only true difference lying in the “color of the graphs,” for
instance,

The seller would have two options open to him. He could
sell his books to the Supply Store at a price matching what
the wholesaler would offer, or he can still “strike out on his
own” and sell his books via the bulletin board method, mak-
ing potentially somewhat more of a profit but encountering
the risk that a student would rather trek over to the book-
store than trek over to some location he never knew existed
before he saw the address on the bulletin board book list.
His prices though, would probably undersell those of the
University Supply Store, which would be offering the books
probably at something more than a half-price rate.

Why the large gap between what the Supply Store would
pay for a book (possibly around 20-25 percent of its list
price) and what price it woud sell a used book for (about
55-05 percent)? Contrary to popular myth, the Supply Store-
bookstore complex is currently operating at a deficit, and it
must try to prevent the growth of this deficit in the future.

Thus, as Sherman reasons, if the Supply Store were to
offer a second-hand text service, it would have to do so in
such a way that it would not lose money. Only if the Supply
Store can buy back books at prices matching what the whole-
saler asks, can it possibly avoid increasing its deficit. For
by buying used texts at these prices, any books which the
store does not sell to students can be sold back to the whole-
saler without losing money on the deal.

The prices at which the used texts would be sold would
help balance the budget of the Supply Store and the bookstore.

There are other reasons for setting up this second-hand
text service in the Supply Store. A prime consideration is that
there is actually little, if any, profit made by the store in
selling new texts, despite the high costs of the books. The
difference between what the store pays for the books and
what the books sell for is “eaten up,” to a large degree, by
freight and postage charges involved in returning unsold
new texts to the publishers, Salaries of personnel in the text
department and losses suffered when faculty members fail
to inform the store that they don’t need books which have
already been received also contribute to reducing any profits
invoved in selling new texts.

But the prime reason for establishing a second-hand text
service lies in the fundamental purpose of the Supply Store
itself. As James Toler, manager of the store points out, the
store exists to be of service to the students; by prov iding
for the sale of used texts, it would fulfill this purpose. The
present bulletin board system (if it can be called a system)
of selling used texts is at the very least inconvenient, and it
does not meet the needs of the students. Through a centralized
used text selling system, says Sherman, the University can
meet these needs,

Mr. Sherman plans to take his case to the EC and the
appropriate University officials. We wholeheartedly support
his proposals, and we wish him the best in accomplishing his
voals. In the meantime, anyone wishing to buy a used set of

Cave Spring High School of Roa-
noke, no less,

It seems, according to reports of
impeccable reliability, that for the
past three weeks CSHS pupils have
led the audience cheering section at
tapings of Klub Kwiz. They've ac-
quired a rather formidable reputa-
tion for their enthusiasm, vigor and
imagination,

Which is to say, they are beating
the Sigma Nu at the Sigma Nus’
own game,

Audience participation at KK
used to be synonymous with SNu,
But now, it appears, they've chosen
not to accept the implicit challenge
hurled at them by .. . children.

Complaint on Procedure

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Last week, I received in the mail
a notice from the University library
stating that they have no record
of receiving a book | borrowed dur-
ing the spring semester of last year,

The library's notice came ap-
proximately 10 months after I bor-
rowed the book. During the inter-
vening period, a summer vacation
has come and gone along with a
semester and a half of the school
year.

This lapse of time only aggra-
vates the difficulties of locating a
lost book. Also, it remains an open
question in my mind whether or
not I failed to return the book when
it was due at the end of the
spring semester, The book in ques-
tion, 823 J892t, Tindall, James
Joyce, was one of several | checked
out for a research paper. I assume—
barring whatever the postman may
bring in the next mail—that the
library has a record of my return-
ing the other books. Until last
week, Thad no reason to suspect that
this book was not back on the
proper shelf,

Gesundheit!

A Guide

By B.S. TIRFBITER

J. Jason Matthews, (not the
Ring-tum Phi), has, in the past
few weeks, offered several stigges-
tions on how to pass the cold (as
opposed to hot) winter months at
Washington and Lee. However, the
best way to pass any and every
month of the year has not been
mentioned, | refer, of course, to the
favorite pastime of so many stu-
dents-—sneezing,

A sneeze is almost always attain-
able when you need it the most,
Of course our Gallic ancestors, (and
others), used stuff, but these arti-
ficial methods have stepped aside
for the more natural and chic ways
to induce sneezing. A sneeze can
never talk back, or almost never,
provided you're not standing at a
table with a bow! of loose consis-
tency garlic dip, and can be relied
upon to do you a good turn when
ether resources, like retching and
gagging, fail. Be good to your
sneezes, coddle them, and they
will always serve you well,

For the imaginative student, the
sneeze can be a great outlet for
creativity. It has been proven that
women are attracted to men who
sneeze on their sholders at a party,
especially if they are wearing sleeve-
less dresses. The Delia Betas at
Hampden-Sydney, for example. have
innovated a unique sneeze that fills
most any occassion where it is
needed, Their secret sneeze is called
the Delta Beta Special —- the techni-
que is a closely guarded secret.
(Actually, they tried selling it but
after no one wanted to buy, they
decided it should be kept within
their fraternal order, much to the
relief of the remaining student bedy
at Hampden-Sydney).

However, through luck and cour-
ageous industrial spies, sources re-
veal that it involves pinching the
mouth tightly so that no air ean
escape, leaving the nostrils to fune
tion as exhaust vents which, due
to their natural form, will create a
two-note blast not unlike an ocean-
going tugboat, This, swears the
president of the DB house, attracts
girls as if they were ducks hearing
a mallard call,

Other interesting things can be
done with sneezes besides just get-
ting sinus relief, In medical jargon
the expulsion of sinoid tension is
called “getting faced,” which is
pretty interesting in itself, provid
ing you don't have to listen to any
metal rust for a test on Monday,

They are asking me to pay for a
book that | had no way of knowing
was lost until 10 months after the
fact.

I do not question the authority
of the library to invoke rules de-
signed to assure the return of bor-
rowed books, however, after so
long a time, | do not think it pos-
sible to determine whether I or the
library is culpable in this instance.

“The faculty card party was a fiasco. President Hunt-

National, state, and local gov-

Though, these law makers are not

“University” Radio?

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

This letter is in regard to the
daily programming of WLUR-FM,
the self-proclaimed “voice of Wash-
ington and Lee University.” While
it’s cultural programs and sports
coverage (discounting of course
those phenomenal football and bas-
ketball announcers) quite possibly
reflects the interests and desires of
our university, | seriously doubt if
the daily programming does, As the
majority interest group of the uni-
versity, this programming should de-
vote a large segment of its time
to the student body’s interests, In
this respect I feel WLUR fails mis-
erably,

During the daylight hours the stu-
dent can only hear the type of
music one expects in a dentist office.
Most common seems to be either
those immortal “one thousand and
one strings play the Beatles” or
“the Herby Mann Singers sing the
hits of 1972,”

Then, all evening our ‘voice’ plays
only classical music,

I know of only one, possibly two
students who would even dream of
turning on WLUR before 11:30
p.m. when, for a whole hour and a
half, the station finally plays some
music the student body wants to
hear. While a portion of the pro-
gramming should include classical
music, it’s share of time is  in-
finitely out of proportion to the
size of its audience.

Maybe WLUR’s programmers are
in league with the bookstore’s rec-
ord department, forcing us to buy
ihe music we wish to hear, or may-
be they personally like ‘dentist
office’ and classical music. This is
no matter. The point is that WLUR
fails as a service to W&L’s interests,

If my own impressions of the
general mood of the student body
are not shared by WLUR's pro-
grammers, may I suggest a poll of
the students themselves. I think the
results would show that WLUR is
not the voice of Washington and
Lee University, Dan White ‘76

To The Art Of Sneezing

The next time you have a date
that won't “satisfy or gratify”. (a
college euphimism signifying either
dancing the Malageuenna with you
or performing unnatural acts on
your body with a Magnovix woofer),
iry a Snap Sneeze for easy consola-
tion, Hold the sneeze you feel com-
ing on as long as you can, then
at the last moment, when you are
no longer able to sustain it, leap
to your feet, draw your imaginary
six-gun which is strapped to your
hip, and let go.

Not only will your date be en-
tranced at the brilliant characteriza-
tion of a cowboy, but the explosive
force of the pent-up sneeze will
show her that you're a virile kind
of guy. If that fails, then you know
you're in trouble and that you'd
better make a Pika Beer Flip quick,
serve hot, drink fast, and forget the
bitch. Double the amount if she
doesn't buy it and still thinks
you're a gork,

If your object for Friday night
is to get “faced” quickly and easily,
then try a “Syncopated Sneeze.” Ii
will make the rank blind date an
easier burden to bear, Just put Dave
Brubeck on the record-player, wait
for his “Take Five” cut, then sneeze
three times for every downbeat in
a prolonged measure which is caco
phonous,

For a true connoissuer of fine
sneezing a few rules should be ob-
served for the maximum enjoyment
of the soul-expanding reaction. The
ideal sneeze should be between 100
and 180 miles an hour in velocity,
with a 18% humidity factor, and a
2.1 Richter Scale reading. lt is said
that the loud sneeze is distasteful
and clammy, but as the object is to
clear your nose of it's tremendous
tensions rather than measure the
scientific properties contained there-
in, this rule may be ignored, For
the rest of us a couple of simpler
rules will be sufficient: NEVER
sneeze just once as this may throw
off your delicate “sneeze control
nodule,” (ocated just behind the
eyes in the small, vaccum filled
cavily between either ear), It should
also be remembered that a sneeze
is a tremendously effective way of
chasing off a hangover or dispelling
feelings of being, “cheap and com-
mon, like all the other girls in the
place.”

As mentioned in the beginning of
this article, the more industrious
among us and these purists may
prefer to create their own sneezes,

With the guillotining of Louis XVI,
snuff has become taboo in “a la
mode” sneezing circles. Many new
techniques are possible including
funneling Campho-Phenique down
your nose, or packing Little Friskies
in your nostrils and lying amongst
a litter of hungry kittens.
However, the trusty ole standby,
looking at the sun, never seems to
fail he who is in need of a patience-
restoring sneeze, Sneezing is accept-
able almost everywhere in society
now, however, diseretion must be
used in difficult situations, like in
the room of dying person. The
cute “Jazz Age” trick of spinning

on the balls of your feet after an
especially strong sneeze, as if you
were jet-propelled, is fine for
nostalgia, but does not really lend
itself to life in these modern times,

Whatever else you plan to under-
take this term, do cultivate your
relationship with the wonderful,
organic phenanmenon of sneezing,
You will certainly find it to be one
of the most rewarding and membor-
able college experiences. So do what
you please as you freely sneeze,
and remember as the  ebscure
Absurdo Riddiculata said, “He who
daily does mightly sneeze, goes be-
fore no man on his knees.”

Spring Course Is Planned
In Library Research

In conjunction with the univer-
sity’s five-year program designed to
increase student and faculty famili-
arity with the W&L library system,
plans are now underway for a Spring
term course (Interdepartmental 190)
for students interested in biblio-
graphical resources.

According to Head Librarian and
Program Director Maurice Leach,
the course, carrying one credit. will
be conducted in accordance with a
$50,000 grant received by the uni-
versity two years ago from the Na-
tional Endowment for the Humani-
ties and the Council on Library Re-
sources,

The course is open to any under-
graduates in the humanities interest-
ed in learning how to use the
libarary more effectively. The pro-
gram is helpful particularly for those
who are planning to do independent
research in a particular field,

According to the Faculty Co
ordinator for the course, English
Professor Sidney Coulling. Interde-
partmental 190 must compleie its
roll in the near future, Since special
planning is required, any students
interested in the program should
comact either Dr. Coulling or a
member of the library staff well in
advance of the regular enrollment
period

Leach also emphasized the need
for early notification by interested
students, since a faculty advisor
must be engaged to supervise the
students’ work in each different ma
por

Plans are already being formu

lated concerning the group for Eng-
lish literature students, to be sup-
ervised by Dr. Edwin Craun. Last
year there were groups organized
for majors in French, Spanish, Ger-
man, and Economics, as well,

According to Mr, Leach, the stipu-
lations of the grant required match-
ing funds to be provided by the
univers'ty, He added that W&L was
only the sixth institution in the
nation to be given such a grant
En-ouraged by our recipiency, other
colleges and universities in the
Southeast have goae on to apply,
and Davidson and Hampden-Sydney
have since received Library grants,

dents to work part-time with the

intermingled with varying amounts

The dance and music is
straightforward: — its
simplicity and directness. These
people have no sophistications or

ana and the Winter Consort coming
out of those kids. Few of the per-
formers in the group are over 15;
many will probably be established
commercial artists in a few years,
if they want to be.

The movement of the rhythms,
expressed in sound, words, or move-
ment, or more often all of these
together, carry the spirit of happi-

movement, relating directly to the

Generals Run First
In Lynchburg Relays

By KEN RUSCIO

Washington and Lee’s indoor
track team captured its first major
title of the year last Saturday when
it travelled to Lynchburg for the
4th annual Lynchburg Relays. The
exciting six way meet was marked
by several close finishes and a tight
battle between Lynchburg, High
Point, and W&L. However, Coach
Norris Aldridge used the team’s
superior depth to the best advantage
in arranging a convincing win.

The W&L sprinters were con-
spicuous as the only contingent
which clearly dominated — their

events, With Paul Suthern anchor-
ing, the 440 and 880 yard relay
squads won with surprising ease.
Pfeifer Helms and John Neumann
doubled with Suthern in both races
while Harry Smith and Brandon
Herbert switched off for the 440
and 880. Suthern returned for his
specialty, the shuttle hurdle relay,
to bring W&L yet another first
place. This along with his contribu-
tion to the high jump relay, which
placed third, established him as the
premiere performer.
Brandon Herbert also starred
with an anchor leg in the mile
relay where coming into the final
straight he overtook his Lynchburg
opponent finishing second by inches
to Christopher-Newport. But he re-
served his real heroics for the sprint
medley relay. A last minute decision
by Coach Aldridge moved Herbert
into the event as the half-mile
anchor leg. Although unaccustomed
to the longer distance he ran one
of the fastest splits of the day in
the most exciting races of the day
giving W&L a third place and
enough points to clinch the meet
going into the final event—the four

meets

mile relay.

The four mile relay is tradition-
ally a race which after the first few
minutes lapses into a monotonous
merry-go-round about as exciting
as watching the foam rubber in the
high jump pit. The fact that this
race would consist of 48 laps and
that W&L had already won the
meet portended roughly — twenty
minutes of wasted time before the
trophy presentation. But the distance
runners were not to be denied
their moment of glory.

Bill Kalal, who earlier had run
a fast mile in the distance medley,
put the Generals in a close second
before handing off to Tom Wash-
ington. Washington threatened to
take the lead at one point but the
High Point runner held off the chal-
lenge. Jim McMenamin did take
the lead however but it was narrow
enough so that after the baton ex-
change Bob Sherwood was in third,
Sherwood quickly took the lead and
fought off several challenges. With
two laps remaining he fell to second
and appeared to be fading. On the
last lap he sprinted to the lead and
fought off his opponents to win by
a fraction.

No one dared mention “anticli-
matic.” But alas, somewhere in the
confusion Roanoke College had
mysteriously passed the pack of
runners and finished first. Offici-
ally W&L was placed second but
we all knew...

The General's depth was also
shown in third place finishes in the
shot put and two mile relays; a
second in the mile relay; a fourth
in the long-jump; and a fifth
in the distance medley. The team is
confident of success in the VCAA
and state championship meets.

Swimmers Capture Third in State;

Three Qualify for NCAA Tourney

By JIMMY BAIRD

The Virginia State Swimming and
Diving Championship were held
February 15-17 and saw highly
touted University of Virginia keep
the championship in Charlottesville
were the meet was held. The Indians
of William and Mary swam _ to
second place and the Washington
and Lee Generals finished a strong
third,

Bill Stearns, coach of the swim-
mining Generals, had high praise
for his young team. In his words,
“The team swam better than any
other team in W&L history in one
meet.” When the competition was
over with the Generals had broken
9 College Athletic Conference and
11 school records, and had a state
diving champion in the person of
Billy Cogar.

Cogar captured the tithe in the
1 meter and 3 meter competition
and qualified for nationals in both
while setting new school and con
ference records in each event. Bill
fiers, a freshman from Florida,
swam the 500 yard and the 1650
yd, freestyle, and while not winning,
did set new conference and school
records in both events. On his way
to the 1650 yd. record he also
broke the 1000 yd. record, In addi-
tion he swam in the 400 and 800
yd, freestyle relays.

Will Brotherton participated in
the two freestyle relays and the 400
yd. medley relay and helped set the
record-breaking pace in al! three.
He then qualified for nationals in
the 100° yd. though he
missed the record by .1 of a second,
He also just missed breaking the
record in the 100 yd. butterfly. Rob
Searles broke the school record in
the 400 yd. individual medley, and
Steve Erickson broke All-American
Billy Ball's conference and school
record in the 100 yd, backstroke.

Each of the relays set new rec-
ords for both school and confer-
ence. The 400 yd. medley relay,
composed of Sieve Erickson, Rich
Koch, Will Brotherton, and Jim
Howard clocked a 3:48.9, just one
second off qualifying for nationals,
The 400 yd. freestyle relay of Rob
Searles, Bill Tiers, Jim Howard, and
Will Brotherton, were timed in at
3:21.3, again an excellent race. And
finally the 800 yd. freestyle relay of

WEL Hoopers Fall To Tigers 78-68;
Take 11-11 Record Into Tournament

By JIM MOZINGO

Washington and Lee wraps up ts
basketball season this week at Se-
wanee, Tennessee, in the CAC
Championships. W&L posted an
t1l-11 record this season and faces
a tough Sewanee team in the CAC.
Despite the tournament being play-
ed in Sewanee and the Sewanee
team having some real talent, W&L
does have a couple of advantages.
One of these is the fac tthat Coach
Verne Canfield has been able to
use his bench quite effectively in the
past several weeks, and playing
Sewanee Saturday night, the third
game of the three-game round-robin
play, should give the Generals an
edge on benches. The Generals are
coming off a loss to rival Hampden-
Sydney and should be maybe a bit
eager to prove themselves,
salvaging 4 winning season, some-
thing WAL has had ever since Can-
field came here

more

That loss to Hampden-Sydney
came Saturday night at Doremus
The most impressive figure on the

court that night was Sydney's Bur-
ness. He scored 17 pts., got 19 re-
bounds, and intimidated the Gen-
erals thoroughly. The Generals again
played to a poor game. The team
has been up and down all season,
and despite Skip Lichtfuss getting
his 1,000th career point the Gen-
erals still lost 78-68.

The Generals ended the regular
season with Lichtfuss leading the
team in scoring with 19.4 ppg., and
in field goal percentage with .443.
Of the first seven players on the
team, Skip was the only one to
shoot over 40%. The team shot
374 for the season. This should be
a real trouble spot in the tourna-
ment, Paul McClure led the team
in rebounding with a 10.4 average,
followed by Lichtfuss and Guy Kerr,
This too was a problem spot for
the Generals as they were outre-
bounded 53.2 to 51.4.

ponent, as we have already mention
ed would seem to be Sewanee, The

Lee swimming team was enhanced
this year. As coach Stearns points
out, the team which went 10-2 in
its dual meet season, ran away
with the VCAA championship, and
were third place in state, is a team
composed predominately of fresh-
men and sophomores. So there is
promise of great things to come, at
least in the next two years.

The CAC championship is the
next meet on the agenda and that
comes up this weekend at Sewanee
University in Tennessee. The swim-
ming team will join the basketball
and wrestling squads for the three
day event and they are looking for-
ward to bringing home the golden
bell. Other teams competing are
Centre of Kentucky and Sewanee

itself,

If the Generals bring home the
CAC bell, it would cap a season
that could be called exemplary.
Three of Bill Stearns’ charges, Will
Brotherton, Steve Erickson, and Bill
Cogar have qualified for the NCAA
college division nationals to be held
in Detroit on March 15-17. Stearns
has done an excellent job this sea-
son, and special notice should be
given to Noel Clinard, a W&L law
student, who has coached Bill Cogar
to such a great year.

The rest of the team will get a
rest after the CAC’s, but those

three going to nationals will still
have a way to go, Whatever turns

Grapplers Up Record To 12-5;
Travel To Sewanee For CAC’s

By PAUL SIMPSON

Last Saturday afternoon, the
Washington and Lee wrestling team
upped its season record to 12-5
with two very easy wins in a tri-
angular meet, The Generals blank-
ed Washington College 39-0 and
stomped Gallaudet 48-6. The only
two W&L losses of the afternoon
came in the latter match with Dan
White and Bob Propet (wrestling
for the injured Rick Heldrich) los-
ing by decisions. Washington left
with a split defeating the sorely de-
pleted Gallaudet squad 29-18.

Doug Ford and Captain Jim Stiefl
upped their records to 12-2 and
12-2-1, respectively. They lead the
team in number of wins,

After last Wednesday's VCAA
championship, these matches were
undoubtedly a welcome relief and
allowed the team to prepare for the
CAC meet at Sewanee this weekend.
Rick Heldrich is expected to be

ready to go and the rest of the
W&L squad should be in good
shape and ready to go,

[he CAC now has only four
teams in it since Washington drop-
ped out and Coach John Piper
thinks that the only team the Gen-
erals should have trouble with
would be Sewanee. Southwestern
Piper noted, is nursing injuries and
the coach is confident that his team
is better than Centre,

Coach Piper explained that be-
cause of the way the tournament is
set up, anything can happen. The
wrestlers are seeded, giving the
returning champions an advantage,
and since Sewanee has four and
W&L has enly one (Ford), the Gen-
erals go in at a disadvantage. Piper
went on to say that he would not
be surprised to see any of the
team’s wrestlers in the finals, but
that he expected to see most of
WA&L’s finalists come from the men

with better than .500 records,

Ihe coach concluded by saying
that he didn’t think the tournament
in its present form was a good
indicator of a team’s strength be-
cause it showed favoritism to some,
giving a definite advantage.

Piper also said that depending
on the outcome of the CAC meet,
he would invite two or three mem-
bers of the team to go to the Small
College finals in South Dakota,

The Future Of ROTC At W&L

By MIKE CHRISTOVICH

Riddle No. 1: What is 154 years
old, provides ample shelter for re-
luctant draftees, and is the largest
producer of officers in the US.
Army? ;

Answer: Reserve Officer Training
Corps (ROTC).

Riddle No. 2: Now that there
is no need to be sheltered from
the Vietnam War, why should any
college student look towards ROTC
as a friendly sanctuary?

Answer: See below.

* Bg 4

ROTC. was originally devised to
develop college educated
men for positions as officers in the
Active Army and Reserves. For the
past eight years the influx
of college students towards ROTC
could) be explained by some by
the Vietnam conflict and the over-
whelming reluctance of many to be
drafted into a war few supported
or believed in, Since the height of
the Vietnam War, when the ROTC
population over 100,000, the
Corps has seen its number dwindle
to less than half that figure.

However, while the end of the
Vietnam War and the inauguration
of the volunteer army have cut
deeply into ROTC’s enlistment, it
does not necessarily spell doom fot
this elderly wing of the Army
lhere are many diverse reasons why
national ROTC will not end in the
near future, but probably the best
reason is the constant need for
trained officers, especially in reserve.

ROTC is the largest, most inex-
pensive method of obtaining and
training men to become Army
officers. These two factors become

but there is always the distinct pos-

sibility that at any time the Wash-

be abolished. All of the detach-

ments of ROTC are subject to an
“annual quota” of some type and
should ROTC at W&L suddenly be-

come unpopular the detachment
would eventually fold. However,
this situation does not seem very
likely as ROTC at WAL is fluorish-
ing as of the present.

Why do students still enlist in
ROTC? Undoubtedly the answer

Larry Evans of the Recruitment

Evans also reported on a recruit-

a pilot. He said the program had
two purposes. (1) To increase the
number of applicants and (2) to
increase the number accepted,

He said the main thrust of the
program was to increase the num-
ber of applicants with a high aca-
demic status, thus increasing the
number accepted with this status;
therefore increasing the academic

Trustees Meet In Atlanta,
Review University Affairs

Last weekend the Board of Trus-
tees held their winter meeting in At-
lanta and reviewed the affairs of the
school, Most of the business brought
before the board was fairly routine,
such as budgetary planning and re
view of the various aspects in the
life of the school.

One of the highlights of the week-
end was the showing of the Reeves
Colection of Chinese export porce-
lain in the High Museum, Atlanta
On the night of Friday, February
23, a reception was held in the High
Museum for the Trustees and inter-
ested alumni in the Atlanta area,
The collection will be exhibited in
Atlanta through April 8

The reception broke up two long
days of meetings and hard work for
the trustees, On Thursday at 8:00
committees of the board
prepare their reports for
that body, The next
morning the full board, President
Huntley, the deans, and Bob Bren
nan began their session at 7:30 a.m
and worked until 2 p.m. that after
noon. The board sat for about the

OUTLOOK and REVIEW

The Arts Saga (Cont. )

Realizing the risk of boring everybody to death with old
business, we nevertheless want to take note of a significant
development in the continuing saga of the Fine Arts at W&L.

As you recall, the whole issue saw first daylight in these
pages in the form of a letter by Mr. Greg Buch way back in
September. Since then, after discussion and more discussion,
an ad hoc committee formed by the University Council has
been working on a report on the situation. Their purpose was
to explore the current condition o fthe Art, Drama, and Music
resources and to make recommendations for improvements in
these areas.

The report has been completed—chock-full of all kinds of
interesting recommendations—and was carried by Student
Body President Bob Brennan to the Board of Trustees’ meet-
ing at the Regency Hyatt House in Atlanta this past week-
end,

The report notes that the basic recommendations made by
the Self-Study of 1964-1966 “appear to have been forgotten,”
and it restates and adds to many of those original suggestions.
Among the short-range recomemndations were: increased staff
for all three departments to absorb sharp enrollment boosts,
more studio space for Art and Drama, and better listening
facilities and instruments for the Music department.

Among the long-range recommendations were: a larger
and safer gallery for display of the university's art collection
and, above all, some kind of theatre-music complex to improve
facilities in those areas.

The Board's response to this report was encouraging.
\fter careful consideration, the gentlemen passed a resolution
which (a) recognizes the importance of the Fine Arts in the
W&L curriculum, (b) thanks the committee for their assidu-
ous efforts and for the report and (c) directs the administra-
tion to study the issue and to report to the Board at its May
necting.

Much labor and concern has been expended to articulate
the very critical needs of the Arts at Washington and Lee.
The issue must not be allowed to get lost in bureaucratic
shufflings, however, and we shall be looking for the all-impor-
tant follow-up which this initial effort deserves.

N.E.P.

To the Athletes Dying Unknown

With the basketball team having an off year, posting a
final 13-12 seasonal mark, interest in Washington and Lee
sports seemed to slack off this winter. The problem was that
fans didn't drop off from watching basketball and switch to
watching swimming or wrestling; they just dropped off from
watching basketball . . . period.

Meanwhile, before crowds which sometimes did manage
to reach fairly respectable (i.e. about 200 persons) size, the
swimmers and wrestlers pulled off some pretty stellar perfor-
mances this year, racking up two of the best regular season
records (10-2 in swimming: 13-5 in wrestling) this school has
seen in any sport in a long time,

Furthermore, the swimmers won the VCAA meet, took

third place in the state, qualified several swimmers for the
nationals, and, just this past weekend, won the CAC meet in
Sewanee. And a host of records were broken or tied by the
W&L swimmers along the way to a spectacular season under
Coach Bill Stearns.

And the wrestlers didn't exactly do badly in tournament
competition either. They also won the VCAA, and they cap-
tured the CAC bell this past weekend too. Under Coach John
Piper, the grapplers came a long way from last year’s .500
record,

Now as lacrosse fever begins to invade the campus, most
students will be thankful to God and/or R. I. Lee that this
dull winter sports session is nearing an end. And just because
they never made it to a swim meet or a wrestling match this
year, and just because the basketballers had a bad season.

Fortunately, with only a handful of athletes graduating
from the swimming and wrestling teams this year, a repeat
performance in following seasons is more than just a possibil-
ity.

But nonetheless, some great performances were missed this
year by the vast multitude of the W&L sportswatchers who
couldn't take time out to watch the swimmers and wrestlers
do some swimming this year. We congratulate these two teams
on their performances this year, and we hope that their accom-
plishments do not go unrecognized by the student body,

P.J.L.

‘Big Five’ And The Coed Vote

Just how the annual ritual which will be decided this
Monday came to be known as the “Big Five” elections, we're
not sure. It does seem delightfully anachronistic—a vestige of
the hard-loving, hard-drinking W&L of old—to be voting for
Dance Board and Faney Dress offices on the same ballot with
Student Body President, Vice-President, and Secretary.

Well, times do change. What was once a furious contest
for Dance Board and Fancy Dress leadership has been reduced
to a pair of unopposed contests.

In the race for Student Body President we are going to
go out on a limb and predict that Mr. Lewis Powell (running
unopposed) will win.

In the race for Vice-President of the Student Body (be-
tween Messrs. Brittin, Greene and Warburton) as well as the
contest for Secretary (between Cavaliere, Keatly, Rigby, and
Sherman), the voting should be much closer,

Not to mention the interesting repeat of the referendum
in which every student's vote will be crucial. While a “yes”
vote on coeducation may not mean an instant turn around of
faculty and administration sentiment, it would most definitely
turn a few heads. If W&L is to seriously consider once again
the coeducation alternative (and we believe it should), a
strong endorsement of the idea on the part of the students will
be absolutely essential.

So with two very competitive and important races, plus
a referendum which may influence the future direction of
Washington and Lee, none of us can afford to “stay home” on
Monday.

Letters To The Editor...

‘Bigotry’ vs. Women

fo the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi.

There has been an apalling silence
on our campus concerning the ques-
tion of coeducation, Silence, how-
ever, and living death (1 do not
consider this an overdramatization)
are what most characterize this cam-
pus. WAL exists as an anomoly, an
archaic outpost of monasticism. I
think the “death” on this campus is
an inevitable result of the nature of
our group situation, Each person is
very much alone here—part of no
community because WAL lacks the
basic elements which combine to
make any real community.

There can be no way for a man
to understand himself outside of a
human context, As long as W&L
lacks women, we have no true
human context in which to live. The
incredible fact that men on our
campus do not miss women on a
day-to-day basis (as evidenced by
the defeat of last year's referendum)
shows just how far many have fal-
len from any sense of their own
humanity. Hew can we expand be-
yond our own personal choking
worlds to act communally, when no
real community exists?

The homogeneity of our group on
campus causes this suffocation. We
have but three women professors,
and almost no racial minorities are
represented either in the student
body or on the faculty, We are thus
denied the richness of possibility
that people from diverse back-
ewrounds can contribute by their uni-
queness alone. Our president, our
trustees, and most importantly the
students must believe that there is
nothing to be shared with women or
non-white men, The position is not
simply outdated; it is hatefully
wrong. It's bigotry in the most evil

ofrse, lof m oie

ho one academic

community can claim ignorance of
the progress in human relations the
rest of the world has made over the
past hundred years.

Only on our campus does the term
“date” persist, evidence of the hide-
ous custom of arranging an appoint-
ment for contact with a woman.
Only in this sexual role do women
appear on this campus (excepting
our few token co-eds), and they are
apparently considered in no other
sense. If we limit the extent of a
woman's humanity, we limit the ex-
tent of our own,

Russ Powell ‘73

W&L, VMI, FCC, ’LUR

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

I write in regard to Mr, White's
letter last week concerning WLUR,
I am sorry that he feels this way
about the station and what it is try-
ing to do. Some of his disagree-
ments, | think, stem from misunder-
standing.

tl is true that we call ourselves
the “Radio Voice of Washington
and Lee.” First, let me say that this
slogan is primarily used for pro-
motional purposes, Perhaps it is a
cheap gimmick. but we have to have
something for people to identify
with WREL and WLUR can be
easily confused. Second, we really
are the University’s broadcast voice,
lt is the entity that holds our license,
Every radio station in the country
must be licensed to a group or in-
dividual by the Federal Communica-
tions Commission, The PCC assign-
ed WLUR's frequency to Washing-
ton and Lee.

Because we call WLUR the Uni-
versity'’s broadcast voice, Mr, White
seems to think we have an overrid-
ing obligation to program what the
student body wants. Nothing could
be further from the truth. Pach fi

censee has an obligation to serve the
“interest, convenience and necessity”
of its coverage area. If a station fails
to mect these guidelines, then its
right to broadcast is taken away,
WLUR's primary obligation is to
Lexington and Rockbridge County—
our coverage area, Of course includ-
ed in this area are the student
bodies of W&L and VMI. But they
aren't the only people who listen to
WLUR, We also have to serve the
faculties of the two institutions as
well as the local residents, We must
try to serve everyone,

Finally WLUR is licensed as an
educational station, Under this pro-
vision we are obligated to present
programming that is educational
and a public service. That is why we
carry programs about health, the
university, Blacks and current events,
These are the programs that Mr.
White seems to be objecting to, lt
is true that they probably don't ap-
peal to many students, but they are
a small part of the WLUR pro-
grams. Music in a “popular-contem-
porary” category takes up more than
half of our broadcast day. Classical
or serious music, on the other hand,
is only about 25 per cent,

Whether we like it or not, WLUR
has an obligation to fulfill, We know
that it is impossible to play every-
one's favorite record of program,
but we are trying to present a good
balance without settling for medio-
erity.

Ice Cold Checks

Over Fancy Dress Weekend ap-
proximately $200 worth of bad
checks were written by Washington
and Lee students, And the students
wonder why it is getting harder to

cash checks in Lexington and why so
much identification is needed. The
main purpose of the Student Finan-
cial Relations Committee, better
known as the Cold Check Commit-
tee, is to back such bad checks and
thereby keep up the students cash
checking privileges in Lexington.
Hoewver, the committee can do only
so much, The students themselves
must help by being more careful.

Most bad checks are written by
first time offenders who are careless
in keeping records or by chronic of-
fenders who eventually have to go
before the Executive Committee.
For those that keep bad records my
advice is to take a few seconds after
you write a check and put it in your
ledger. Also, at the end of the month
reconcile your statement.

If you do not know how to do
this, any of the Lexington banks
can show you as well as any mem-
ber of the Cold Check Committee.
Wf you take these small precautions
it will save you and the Cold Check
Commitice a lot of time and trouble.

Films In Review

‘Deliverance’ Thrills

To coincide with James Dickey’s
appearance on campus this week for
‘Contact?’ symposium, the film ver-
sion of his novel, ‘Deliverance’ be-
gins Wednesday at the State Theatre
for a two week engagement. —Ed,

By SKIP PAUKERT
Deliverance
Directed by John Boorman, with
Burt Reynolds and John Voight

To those of us who read Deliver-
ance when it first came out a couple
years back, it seemed to be one of
those novels which was written with
the film rights in mind. Here was a
book with a formula for success as
an adventure tale—four Atlanta
businessmen out for a weekend to
beat a white water river in the wild-
erness of northern Georgia. The
right themes were there—man vs,
nature, man’s law vs. the law of the
jungle—along with pure, unadulter-
ated action, with a littke sodomy
and murder thrown in for good mea-
sure,

It is obvious how all this, in the
wrong hands, could come off as very
trite stuff indeed, Fortunately, it was

Swedish exchange student Gunnar Ohlen,

in the hands of James Dickey, who,
through passages of sheer poetic de-
scription and a tight narrative, man-
aged ito make it all work.

Deliverance was blessed a second
time, when transferred to film, John
Boorman was chosen as the director,
Boorman deserves tremendous cred-
it for the difficult task of translating
Dickey’s flowing language into a
fast-paced, exciting movie.

And somebody’s coup was casting
Burt Reynold’s as Lewis, the he-
man survival nut who leads the
group. There is nothing very subtle
about Reynold’s performance, but
then again, there was nothing very
subtle about Lewis in the novel
either. Reynold’s presence and sheer
energy conspire early on to convince
us of his rightness for the part.

John Voight, as the only other
big-name actor in the cast, turns in
a creditable job as Ed (who narrat-
ed the first-person novel), but he
seems a little too wide-eyed and in-
credulous at times,

The other two parts are filled,
grounds can contribute by their uni-

Swedish Exchange Student
Views WGL And Future

By DOUG BURTON

Swedish medical students, like
their American counterparts, face
years of grinding pressure, and for
Gunnar Ohlen of Stockholm a year
at W&L is almost a year of rest be-
fore taking that plunge.

Of course he's too displomatic to
admit it. “I spend as much time on
my courses here as | would at home,
even though | will receive no credit
for them in Sweden,” he said, Stu-
dents who meet him notice immedi-
ately his Kissingeresque savoire-
faire. To no small advantage is his
excellent command of English, the
result of ten years of training in
school and the inevitable exposure
to American and British television
programming.

For a student who receives no
academic credit in Sweden for his
year at this University, Gunnar
spends a remarkable portion of his
time in McCormick Library. But
considering the sysiem Gunnar had
to beat in order to get into Med-
school, t's no wonder that he’s dis
ciplined. Competition among would
be physicians there is just the same
as it is in the U.S, with the sole
criterion for admission being a stu-

dent's grade point average—no
exams, no personal interviews.

Unlike most other European na-
tions Sweden has abolished compul-
sory eXaminations as a way of de-
termining which students will be
allowed to attend secondary schools
and which shall be given vocational
training. Another policy abandoned
is that of holding back those stu-
dents whose performance is con-
sidered substandard. Slow learners
are given special tutoring but re-
main with their peers, so that the
same children who begin school to-
gether at the age of seven will gradu-
ate from “basic” school en masse at
the age of sixteen,

Gunnar has been accepted at a
medical school in Sweden where he
will continue his studies next fall.
This summer he plans to cover as
much of the U. S, as possible on a
transcontinental road-trip. He came
to WAL to study Sociology and to
enjoy a different culture while he
still has the time,

Gunnar describes both his father,
a civil engineer for the Swedish gov-
ernment and his mother, an ortho-
dontist, as “workaholies.” He says

B’Ballers Take 2nd;
Two Make All-CAC

By JIM MOZINGO

W&L acquitted itself well this
weekend at Sewanee, Tennessee, The
Generals finished the season at 13-
12, defeating a good Centre team on
Thursday, 86-74, and a surprising
Southwestern team Friday, 68-60.
These two games set up the cham-
pionship game Saturday — night
against Sewanee, who had swept its
earlier foes. The Generals played
well, and in the words of Coach
Verne Canfield, “finally put it all
together,” in the final game of the
season, Canfield has again put to-
gether another winner, no matter
how marginal, and says the team is
already looking forward to next sea-
son, (They'll begin working out again
in approximately two weeks.) De-
spite this the Generals were unable
to overcome a talented Sewanee
team on Saturday. Sewanee shot
66% from the field for the game,
most on medium and long range
jumpers and that’s hard to overcome
no matter how well you play.

WAL had several players who
made a big impression on observers
of the tournament, the foremost of
these being Senior Captain Paul Mc-
Clure and Junior Skip Lichtfuss,
both of who made the all-tourna-
ment team. Skip scored 67 points in
the three games at Sewanee, and
Paul ended his career at W&L with
an outstanding defensive perfor-
mance as well as 20 points and 12
rebounds Saturday night. He and
freshman Norm Kristoff did a tre-
mendous job on Sewance’s 7° Bill
Kosick, who was named MVP of
‘e tourney, primarily because of
his play against Sewanee’s first two
opponents, because McClure and
Kristoff held him to one of his worst
games of the season, fouling out
with 11:28 left in the game. The two
other men on the all-tournament
team were Sewanee players also.
They were freshman Eddie Krenson
and Senior Eddie Greene, the two
major factors in W&L's loss Satur-
day night.

But the road to Saturday began
back on Thursday night against
Centre, who came into the tourney
on a hot streak, The Generals man-
aged to rise to the occasion however
and put Centre down 86-74, Centre

got a shot in the arm for the tour-
nament with the return of all-CAC
forward Mike Pharriss. This was to
be his first action since February 9.

W&L had three players foul out,
Kerr, Croghan and Fitzgerald. The
loss of Hatton Smith was lightened
by the performance of yet another
of this years freshmen, guard John
Podgajny, who in his stint hit 4 of
5 shots from the field. The Generals
had their highest number of field
goals for the season in the Centre
game with 40; unfortunately their
performance from the line was an
anemic 6 of 18 (33%).

Friday night brought Southwes-
tern, a weak team most of the year,
to face the Generals, The Blue play-
ed a rather lazy game, and tried to
fritter the game away at times, but
managed to hold on with the help
of the 4-corners to win. The second
half remained close until the 12:57
mark when Lichtfuss and Kerr con-
tributed two fast break layups to
move the score to 48-40, From then
on the Generals held SWN at arms
length an dfinished the game at 68-
60. Lichtfuss got 26 and Clelan 12,
while McClure pulled down 10 re-
bounds.

But all these two games did was
set the stage for Saturday night's
championship game. Verne Can-
field's early season dream was finally
realized as he watched Norm Krist-
off and Paul McClure start together,
and both men did an excellent job.
The game opened like a two-man
show down between Paul McClure
and Sewanee’s Eddie Krenson, Both
had 10 points after the first 10 min-

es. With 4:05 left im the first half
Krenson had forged a 36-26 lead.
But at 4:05 Kosick picked up his
3rd foul, and 14 seconds later Licht-
fuss picked up his third. The half
ended at 46-36, with Kosick, Greene,
Bohrman, and Hoffman each having
three fouls for Sewanee, and Licht-
fuss, Kerr and Williams having three
for W&L. After only 2:19 of the
second half Kosick picked up his
fourth foul of the game. This had
been the W&L game plan, to fence
off Kosick with McClure and Krist-

Washington and Lee grapplers brought the golden bell back with them from “the Mountain.” Now Coach
Piper must choose his three top wrestlers, who will have the honor of participating in the NCAA’s,

Tankers Win Golden Bell;
Climax Fine 10-2 Season

By JIMMY BAIRD

The Washington and Lee Gen-
erals ended their season last week-
end with a convincing victory in the
College Athletic Conference swim-
ming championships. The team cap-
tured the CAC golden bell by de-
feating Sewanee of Tennessee and
Centre of Kentucky.

The swimmers joined the W&L
wrestling and basketball squads at
the University of the South for the
annual CAC winter sports festival,
which began on Thursday, February
22 and ended last Saturday .

The first day of competition de-
monstrated that the race for the
crown would be primarily between
Washington and Lee and Sewanee.
The Sewanee team got the firsts but
WA&L’s superior depth enabled them
to place more swimmers in 2nd,
third and fourth. The point total
after the first day was close with
Washington and Lee ahead by only
eleven.

The next day however, the Gen-
erals put everything together by not
only winning almost every event but
establishing new records in them.
The third and final day was icing on
the cake as the swimmers wrapped
up the championship, with victories
in the relays. All in all the tankers
broke 9 conference records and es-
tablished 5 school records while
three, Will Brotherton, Steve Erick-
son, and Bill Cogar, qualified for the
NCAA college division nationals.

Bill Tiers, a freshman from Vero
Beach, Florida, won the 200, 500,
and 1650 yd. freestyle, and estab-
lished conference records in both
the 500 and 1650. For these perofr-
mances, he was voted as the Out-
standing Swimmer in the Meet.

Will Brotherton also had an ex-
cellent meet by winning the 100 and
200 yard butterfly. He set confer-
ence and school records in both and
qualified for nationals in the 100.
He also swam on the medley and
800 free relay that set conference
records,

Junior Steve Erickson won the
100 and 200 yard backstroke, set-
ting new conference and school rec-
ords and qualifying for nationals in
the 100. Richard Kooh, a sopho-
more from Missouri was the third
double winner, He captured firsts in
the 100 and 200 yd. breaststroke and
broke the conference record in the
100, He also swam on the confer-
ence record breaking medley relay.
Bill Cogar, the freshman who won
the state championships a few weeks
ago, captured first in the one meter
diving and established school records
while qualifying for nationals in

both the one meter and three meter
diving.

The 800 yd. freestyle relay which
established a new conference record
was helped out by senior Alan Cor-
with and freshman Rob Seales, while
Gary Seldomridge anchored the
400 yd. medley relay which also set
a new conference record, Others who
placed and helped W&L bring home
the CAC bell were freshman Craig
Graham, John Henzel, Alan Petti-
grew; sophomore Jim Howard, Jun-
ior Tom Young and Sr .Aven Sharp.

Looking back, the season has been
a good one, Composed almost en-
tirely of freshmen and sophomores,
the team was not expected to get
going carly in the season. But Coach
Bill Stearns brought his team along
fast and tough. The Christmas break
was offset by many swimmers tra-
velling to Ft. Lauderdale for the
Swimming Coaches Annual Forum.

The Generals got back together
and carried their undefeated dual
meet status until they met with the
University of Virginia. The team
bounced back from that loss to a
victory over perenially tough V.M.1.
Hopes were high then for a win
over William and Mary in Williams-
burg, but the Generals were edged
by a single point. The following
week, the dual meet season ended
with the Generals carrying a 10-2
record into the Virginia College Ath-
letic Association state meet. W&L
had no problem getting that one,
and it enabled many of Stearns’ in-
experienced swimmers to have a
chance at showing their stuff. They
responded in admirable fashion.

It goes without saying, though,
that all eyes were on the Virginia
State Championship meet to be held
in Charlottesville the following
week. U.Va, was just out of reach,
but the Generals were waiting for
another chance at the Indians of
William and Mary. The swimmers
tried their very best. Twenty con-
ference and school records fell but
it Was not enough to overcome the
performances turned in by U.Va.
and William and Mary. So, although
the team swam their best meet all
year, they had to settle for third
place, Disappointment did not fast
long as the Generals swam another
good meet this past weekend to win
the CAC’s.

Individual performances which
highlighted the season are difficult to
pick out, However three Generals
qualified for the college division na-
tionals to be held in Detroit.

Bill Cogar, the freshman diving
sensation from Richmond, Virginia,
scored enough points to qualify
many times over the season. His big
accomplishment, though, was bring-
ing the state diving championship in
! and 3 meter competition home to
WAL.

Steve Erickson, who had such a
good season his freshman year, did
not swim last year, but came back
this year to swim better than ever.
He qualified for the nationals in both
the 100 and 200 yd. backstroke,

Will Brotherton, a sophomore
from West Virginia, was picked to
fill the big shoes of Bim Clark who
graduated last year.

Will, who excelled last season in
the middle distance freestyle races,
took on the job with guts and de-
termination. Swimming the 50 free-
style and butterfly events, he worked
all season, even swimming his old
races of the 100 and 200 yd. free-
style. It all paid off in the State and
CAC meets. In the state meet he
swam on all three relays which es-

Wrestlers Have
Six Champions:
End 13-5 Year

By KEN RUSCIO

Washington and Lee’s wrestling
team finished their season last Sat-
urday by capturing the CAC cham-
pionships at Sewanee, The Generals
received most of their competition
from the host college, however the
final score of 88-80 showed a clear
margin of victory. Centre and South-
western trailed in the scoring.

Coach Piper's squad overcame
the burden of plodding through sev-
eral preliminary matches to advance
8 wrestlers to the finals, Although
this number was matched by Se-
wanee, W&L held a 72-66 advan-
tage. Following the pattern of the
season, the lower weight classes pro-
vided the spark. Successive victories
in the finals over Sewanee were
provided by Don Overdorff (a su-
perior decision at 118), Lee Keck
(126), Dan White (134), and Bill
Melton (142). Jim Stieff kept the
streak alive in the 150 pound class
by defeating his Centre opponent,
All matches were decisive decisions
putting Sewanee in the difficult posi-
tion of having to win the remainder
of their matches to take the tourna-
ment, Their hopes vanished when
Centre defeated the Sewanee wrest-
ler in the 158 class.

Tension remained high, however,
as Doug Ford (167) went in the final
against Sewanee’s Lenahan, holder
of a 19-1 record. In the first period
Ford, the victim of a near pin,
trailed 4-0 and by the third period
was down 7-2, With a minute re-
maining Ford skillfully maneuver-
ed his way to a 7-7 tie, but Lena-
han’s one point riding time provided
the narrow margin of victory in the
tournament's most exciting encount-
er.

At 177, Sam Lewis won on a pen-
alty point over his Centre opponent,
but Dave Powers was pinned in the
heavyweight final. Other scorers for
WA&L were Fred Heldrich, fourth at
158, and Dave Knack, third at 190,

For Coach Piper's squad it was a
fitting climax to an extremely suc-
cessful 13-5 season which included

‘Deliverance’

(Continued from Page 2)
Ned Beatty, plays the easy-going,
guitar-picking Drew, and Ronny Cox
appears as an appropriately whiney
and clownish Bobby.

Dickey himself authored the
screenplay and appears briefly in the
last half-hour of the film, scratching
his red neck as the local sheriff.

All of these excellent perfor-
mances, however, could easily have
been wasted by sloppy direction and
photography. And, luckily, Deliver-
ance turns out to be the very model
of quality on both counts. Again,
Boorman deserves a gold star for his
action scenes—ttterly crisp and
breathtaking—as the four (all of
whom served, for the most part, as
their own stunt men) plunge down
the river admidst a tempest of white
foam and boulders, The sheer ele-
mental power of the river is com-
municated beautifully, The locale
for the shooting is absolutely au-
thentic; most of the filming was
done on the Chatooga River in the
North Georgia mountains (though,
as far as | could tell, the gorge
where Ed climbs up the cliff was
filmed at the Linville River in North
Carolina).

fhe photography itself is distine-
tively atmospheric. Here the colur 1s
grainy, vague, and monochromatic-—
lending a texture to the film which
fits the forested landscapes perfectly.

Well, what about the content of
the film? The themes are not hard
to get at—even her loveliness Pau-
line Kael saw that these men were
challenging nature “in search oi
manhood,” But there is still a little
more to Deliverance than that—the
river is to be flooded, rendered pow-
erless by a dam, and Lewis leads his
unwilling cohorts on one last chance
to challenge its force. “Why do you
wanna go down that river fer?” acks
the incredulous mountain man who
Lewis contracts to drive their cars
downstream. “Because it’s there.”
Lewis could have no other :eply.

Cliche? Sure. But Lewis, with his
wetsuit, his bow and arrows, and
survival pateh, is himself a cliche.

Despite its overall quality, the
film does seem to fall apart once
the men climb out of the river. After
that point, Voight is asked to carry
the show, and he’s simply not up to
it, So the film really doesn’t con-
clude: it just goes on and on for
the last half-hour, from scene to
scene, not really knowing where to
focus. Boorman even throws in a
perfectly awful dream sequence, in
which a shiny, blue (and very plas-
tic) hand rises out of moonlit river
io haunt poor Ed in his dreams.

But for the most part, Deliverance
is undeniably exciting and effective.
And perhaps the highlight of the
whole movie is that very early scene
where Drew and an impoverished
and deformed Appalachian boy joia
in a now-famous guitar-banjo duet.
The poignancy of that scene alone is
well worth the price of admission.

Military History Opens
lo the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:
Although my letter is less exciting
than those you usually receive, it
may prove to be of more lasting in-
terest. On behalf of the Military
Science department and of the Stu-
dent Curriculum Committee I want
to direct attention to the fact that
beginning next year interested stu-
dents will be able to pursue two
semesters of American military his-
tory without attending drill outside
of class. The department has taken
this step so that anyone who wishes
may broaden his general education
without being committed to the
ROTC program. Other programs of
this sort are in the works, and in-
quiries may be addressed to Major
William Dragozetich or to me. Mili-
tary science for the non-ROTC stu-
dent should expand the offerings of
the university in a way many will
find meaningful.

averaging over 22 ppg and plus 14
rebounds, was held to 10 points and
6 rebounds, Despite this, Skip pick-
ed up his fourth foul at 15:31 and
helped nullify the advantage. Sewa-
nee’s Green hit a hot streak of four
baskets that was only stopped by his
fourth foul. Then came the big
chance, when Kosick picked up his
fifth with 11:28 remaining. The score
at the time was 65-52. Hoffman, an-
other starter was lost at 8:05 with
the score 71-59 Sewanee. But for
some reason the Generals were un-
able to take advantage of their
chances and Lichtfuss fouled out
with 4:36 left and the score 79-68.
WAL closed the lead to seven at
1:24 and 86-79, but 7 was as close
as the Generals were to get that
night as Sewanee and its 66% field
goal percentage hung on to win,

Greene hit 12 of 18 from the field,
Krenson 15 of 19, and Kosick 5 of

as “a poor educational environment”
and did not see Why any institution
should remain all-male simply to
provide an alternative for incoming
freshmen who think they would pre-
fer an all-male student body. “I
think such an environment is suffici-
ently artificial to do a disservice to
all concerned,”

Brennan countered that his op-
position rested on two main points:
(1) that there was no compelling
reason to go coed for admissions
reasons, and (2) that the increase in
size necessary to implement the pro-
gram would be undesirable.

Hodges argued that the difference
between a student body of 1400 and
1800 would be “psychologically” in-
significant.

He added,

“Student opinion is

very important to the policy makers
at W&L,” and urged a heavy turn-
out on Monday.

the all-tournament team. Skip got

19 points and 10 rebounds, and
made the all-tourney team; and

Norm Kristoff scored 12 points and
snagged 11 rebounds in an excellent
performance not only for this game,
but for the entire tournament, Char-
lie Strain and Doug Clelan also put
on good performances as Charlie
got 11 points and Doug's floor play
held the team together, despite his
poor shooting night. But the real
story of the game was Sewanee’s
phenomenal shooting. Greene, who
had been averaging 12.1 ppg., took
advantage of the double-team on
Kosick to get 25 points and hit 12
of 18, But his performance still
played second to freshman Eddie
Krenson, whose 31 points led all
scorers, as did his 15 of 18 shooting
performance. Until Saturday Kren-
son was averaging 11.4 ppg. in the
shadow of Kosick, but when W&L
doubled-up on the big man Kren-
son went wild. The Generals played
well, and if Sewanee had shot closer
to its season’s average the game
might have been a whole different
story.

that his own attitude toward work
is more moderate, especially this
year. While in the U.S, he considers
his studies secondary to his obliga-
tion to talk to Americans, a_ task
eased by a sheaf of Swedish public
information brochures,

Of the University he said, “I have
the feeling that a person can pick
and choose the courses he wants to
study, I think that some people gei
by without doing very much . . .
But | am very favorably impressed
by the Honor System. When I re-
ceived the pamphlet describing it at
home, | had mixed emotions.”

But now I see it as very positive.
Ican leave my pencils and books
someplace, and when | come back,
they are still there. | also have very
positive feelings about your system
of independent examinations.”

With regard to medicine Gunnar
sees a need to humanize the doctor.
“There are some cases in which
medical services have gone too far
into the technical side. A doctor pre-
scribes pills for a patient when what
he should do is sit down with him
and explain the problem on a_per-
sonal, grass roots level.” Whatever
Gunnar’s ideas about medicine are,
they will have ample time to grow.
He estimates that from the time he
enters medical school, his status as
a fully acoredited practitioner is a
full eleven years away.

Gregory's speech, ending about |

the audience had come to hear

W&L Theatre Presents
‘Thieves Carnival’ Farce

CHRISTOVICH

Jean Anouilh’s farcical comedy,
“Thieves Carnival,” will be pre-
sented by the Washington and Lee
University Theatre March 20-24, in
the university's theatre.

By MICHAEL

The play is in almost direct con-
trast to earlier productions of the
University Theatre this year, “Troi-
lus and Cressida” and “Streetcar
Named Desire,” according to the
director of the play Lee Kahn.

While few can see any compari-
sons between the dramatic works
of William Shakespeare and
Anouilh, there was particular care
taken in the arrangement of the
three plays for this season's Uni-
versity Theatre productions. Follow-
ing two highly intense dramatic
productions, Anouilh’s “Thieves
Carnival” allows both director Kahn
and the WAL viewing audience a
break from seriousness to high level
comedy

Unlike many of Anouilh’s other
works, “Thieves Carnival” does not
possess an underlying social theme,
but only portrays farcical comedy
at a steady level. Anouilh, who
usually is affiliated with the Theatre
of the Absurd has partially for

saken his usual thematic profundity
for a completely one level farcial
comedy

Unlike “Streetcar,” the script of
“Thieves Carnival” will not under-
go many changes as this production

calls for only hilarity, not his-
Lrionics,

The set being built by Greg
Buch features a vintage look at

Edwardian times complete with in-
tricate latice work and Fragonards
Because overall comedy is the main
genre of “Thieves Carnival” none
of the individual characters have any
degree of depth or symbolism, but
merely serve as carefree marioneties

New Contenders Enter

Lewis Powell is no longer unop-
posed in his bid for presidency of
the student body, as three other
W&L students took advantage of
a one-week delay in elections to
announce their candidacies for the
post.

Juniors Averill Harkey and Harry
Smith and intermediate law student
Doug Schwartz have filed petitions
for the presidential post. Last week
at this time, Powell, a junior, was
running without opposition.

The voting was delayed one week
due to a clause in the student body
consitution stated that “General
elections for the Big Five Positions
shall be held on the Monday of the
tenth week” of the Winter Term
This past week was only the ninth
of the semester.

Campaign speeches by candi-
dates for student body offices
will be given Thursday at 7
p.m. in Evan’s Dining Hall,

Junior Richard Jones is still run-
ning unopposed for Fancy Dress
president, but previously unopposed
sophomore candidate T. Barry Davis
now has to oppose freshman Bill
Sands for the post of vice-president
of the Dance Board.

The slate of candidates is un-
changed for vice-president of the
student body, with juniors Mike
Brittin, Steve Greene, and Bill War-
burton in the battle.

One more candidate has been
added to the race for secretary of
the student body, bringing the total
number of candidates for that office
to five. Junior Everett Martin has
joined Paul Cavaliere, Bob Keatley,
Dave Rigby, and Ben Sherman in
the race.

The Executive Committee Mon-
day noted that all students except
exchange students would be eligible
to vote in Monday's election,

The hotly debated coeducation
referendum came into some hot de-
bate for a reason other than the
coed issue itself Monday at the EC
meeting. Vice-president Bill Merrill
made a motion to allow only the
undergraduate student body to vote
on the referendum.

Merrill felt that since the law
school was already coed, it was not
really concerned with the coeduca-
tion issue. He also said the law
school would not be affected on
a classroom basis if the undergradu-
ate school went coeducational,

Law representative Jeff Twardy
took exception to this, stating “You
can't tell me that the law school
will not be affected by a potential
coeducational situation.” Several EC
members agreed, noting that the
law school is an important part of
the university as a whole, and that
it would be affected if the whole
school went coed,

Merrill's motion was defated in

Up Contact 73

next to last scheduled speech in this
year’s Contact program. However,
L. Patrick Gray, acting director of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
could not come to Lexington Tues-
day night due to hearings currently
being held regarding his appointment
to the post of director of the FBI
permanently.

Contact officials said they are try-
ing to reschedule Gray's appearance
for later this spring.

Three other speakers came to
Washington and Lee University this
past week, Last Wednesday, former
columnist Frank Mankiewicz spoke
on the “Government and the Press.”
Thursday, feminist Betty Friedan
spoke in Lee Chapel (see story on
page 3). James Dickey poet and
author of Deliverance, gave a read-
ing from his works Friday.

Most of Gregory's speech was
directed towards a variety of social
problems in this country, However,
a main theme of his speech cited
the role of college youth in America
for bringing the Vietnam War fin-
ally to a “winding down.” He did
not once mention that he considered
the war actually “ended” yet.

Gregory has been fasting for
nearly two years to protest the war.
During that time his weight dropped
from a high of over 280 pounds to
a low of, at one time, 98 pounds.
Gregory does not consume any
solids in his diet,

The social critic stressed the point
that he would remain fasting until
the war is over and all the prison-
ers on all sides were returned, Bul,
he added, once he goes off his
fasting, he would not do it again
“even if they were fighting in my
own house,”

Gregory ended his speech by call
ing for social change, but he also
added that violence is not the answer
io Aemrica’s social problems. If

violence were the answer, par-
ticularly for blacks, he noted, then
“a gun would be as hard to get
in the black ghetto as a good job.”

Mankiewicz anchored a “Free-
dom of Information” panel Wednes-
day afternoon as part of his dis-
cussion on the government and the
press, Also on the panel were Larry
Maisel, news director of WDBJ-TV
in Roanoke, Don Murray, former
news director, and Jay Denny, a
WA&L student,

Though the thrust of Mankie-
wicz's speech in Lee Chapel was
directed towards sharp criticism of
the state, he also leveled several
blasts at the press. For example,
he noted that the broadcast media
in the last election, because of time
limits, could only cover day to day
issues of the campaigns without cov-
ering the larger picture of the elec-
tions. He cited this as a prime rea-
son for MecGovern’'s sound defeat to
Nixon, as the press failed to discern
McGovern's “old-fashioned” cam-
paign from Nixon's “new style” of
campaigning, where he did almost
all of his campaigning without pub-
lic appearances or press conferences,

Another criticism leveled by Man-
kiewiez concerned the press’s exces-
sive reverence for the presidency.
The president, said Mankiewicz, has
been surrounded with pomp and
circumstance that “would embarass
the Grand Duchess of Lichtenstein.”

Dickey's speech was limited pri-
marily to readings from several of
his works, Earlier last Friday, how-
ever, in a discussion at the book-
store, Dickey did discuss the movie
Deliverance, based upon his novel,
He said the movie would have had a
good shot at winning an oscar for
“best picture” if The Godfather had
not received so much publicity,

=

a vote following the debate, two
votes for and eight against, with
one abstention, EC president Bob
Brennan then suggested that the
referendum vote be taken by classes,
and this was approved without
formal vote.

According to the student body
consitution, petitions for class repre-
sentation on the EC will be due

Race

March 19, in the eleventh week of
the term. Elections will be the fol-
lowing Monday.

In the case that no candidate gets
a majority of the vote in any or
all elections, a run-off election is
scheduled for next Thursday. In the
run-off, the two highest vote-getters
in the first election for each office
will be candidates.

Lawyer, Businessman
Elected As Trustees

A prominent Houston attorney
and a North Carolina manufactur-
ing executive have been elected to
the board of trustees.

The election of Thomas D, And-
erson of Houston, a 1934 graduate,
and J. Alvin Philpott of Lexington,
N.C., a 1947 graduate, came at the
midwinter meeting of the board,
held last month in Atlanta.

Mr. Anderson is a partner in
Anderson, Brown, Orn & Pressler,
Houston law firm, and president of
Boston Co, of Texas, an invest-
ment counseling service. Mr. Phil-
pott is executive vice president of
Burlington House Furniture, a di-
vision of Burlington Industries, and
a director of the Southern Furni-
ture Manufacturers’ Association.

After graduation from Washing-
ton and Lee, Mr. Anderson joined
a Houston law firm, but in 1947
was named vice president of the
Texas National Bank. In 1956 he
became president of Texas Fund
Management Co., and later was
senior vice president and trust officer
of Texas Commerce Bank. He re-
turned to the practice of law in
1965,

He is a director and past presi-
dent of the Museum of Fine Arts
of Houston and the city’s Grand
Opera Association. He is also a
board member of the Episcopal
Church Foundation, the Episcopal
Diocese of Texas, and Lambuth
College, which awarded him an
honorary doctorate in 1967,

Mr. Philpott, a member of the
board of directors of W&L’s Alumni
Association since 1971, has been
associated with Burington House,
formerly United Furniture Co., since
graduation from W&L. He too is
extremely active in community
affairs, and has been chairman of
the city school board, hospital, Red
Cross, United Fund, Boy Scouts’
council, and Kiwanis Club,

One son, Benjamin G. Philpott,
is currently a junior at the uni-
versity. Mr. Philpott’s brother, Harry
M. Philpott, president of Auburn
University, is also a Washington and
Lee graduate.

Both men will join the board
formally when it meets here in May.
Their elections bring to 21 the num-
ber of trustees now serving. The
university's charter authorizes a
maximum of 22 trustees.

Commerce School Review
Launches Inaugural Issue

The Washington and Lee Com-
merce Review, a newly established
academic and professional journal,
has announced the publication of
its first issue.

The first two articles deal with
money, monetary theory and gov-
ernmental manipulation. The first,
“What Has Government Done to
Our Money?”, by Dr. Murray N.
Rothbard, Professor of Economics
at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute,
is an application of the philosophical
alternative of the free market eco-
nomy to the production, distribu-
tion, and exchange of that familiar
commodity known as money. The
second article, “The Federal Re-
serve System: Pro and Con,” is a
differing viewpoint expressed by
WAL alumnus, Senator William
Brock of Tennessee. The third and
fourth articles deal with crises of
constitutional law, “The Attack on
the American Free Enterprise Sys-
tem,” is authored by the Honorable
Lewis FP. Powell, Jr., Associate Jus-
tice of the U.S, Supreme Court.

The Review's Sunday punch is the
previously unpublished conclusion to
Anthony Sutton’s three volume
study Western Technology and
Soviet Economic Development, 1917
to 1965, in which Sutton summarizes
the total dependency of the Soviet
economy upon Western technology
which has resulted from the in
ability of Soviet central planning to

i

serve as a Viable alternative cco-
nomic system,

The student founder and Editor-
in-Chief of the Review is William
G. K. Merrill, who is Vice-President
of the W&L student body, Treasurer
of the Commerce School Fraternity,
Assistant Head Dorm Counselor, a
Robert E. Lee Research Scholar,
a member of O.D.K. honor fra-
ternity and of Who's Who Among
Students in American Colleges and
Universities.

Merrill envisions the Review as
a means for the ongoing examina-
tion and debate of topics covered
in courses on business and eco-
nomics taught at this University, In
addition, the journal will be a
medium of communication between
students, faculty, businessmen and
government officials, Merrill hopes
to clarify a broad spectrum of
issues in economics and politics by
a “thorough analysis of the funda-
mental assumptions and premises
inherent in, but often overlooked
by, much contemporary dialogue.”
Above all the Review will allow
for the presentation of alternatives
in political and economic thought,
regardless of how fashionable those
alternatives may stand in the aca-
demic community.

The Review began to take shape
during the Summer of 1972, when
Merrill began soliciting contribu-

Yes On Coeducation
The

\nd if one can draw any conclusion from the student argu-

second annual coeducational referendum approaches,

ments which have been bandied about in anticipation of the
vote, it is this: no matter what side you're on, coeducation is
essentially an emotional issue.

Which is really too bad. For the prospect of coeducation
at Washington and Lee involves many intricate and difficult
problems which tend to get lost under the pro and con
rhetoric.

It is so easy, when debating the coed issue, to stereotype
one’s opposition. Many of the status quo advocates seem to
envision themselves standing firm against an onslaught of

of the pro-coed faction see their opposition as a male chau-

freaks looking for “relationships” instead of “dates.”
vinist fraternity block, fighting to preserve an outmoded
“down the road” lifestyle.

And it is these “gut” feelings to which most of the
rhetoric can be reduced,

In one sense, this dilemma is inescapable, since coeduca-
tion would mean a decided qualitiative change in Washington
and Lee social life. Whether or not the boy-girl “games” we
all play would be eliminated is uncertain; at least, the games
woud be different.

And so, for most of us voting in Monday's referendum,
our minds will be made up on the basis of how we as indi-
viduals have reacted to our experience at an all-male W&L
environment. If we have accepted the present “game” and
have played it well, chances are we'll be satisfied to see W&L
remain the same. If we have found this “game” to be frus-
trating and absurd, we'll most likely vote for some changes.

But in the interest of some kind of detachment, we would
like to review some of the arguments articulated by both the
anti-and pro-coeducation camps.

Three main objections keep arising out of any anti-co-
education argument:

(1) The cost would be much too great. Both sides agree
that introducing girls into the system here would mean
considerable expansion of facilities, both academic and social.
the
humanities and the fine arts. New dormitories would have to
be built.

(2) The necessary increase in enrollment would be unde-

There would most likely have to be a_ beefing-up of

sirable. W&L has always prided itself on the maintenance of
a good student-teacher ration and a small student body,

(3) Since we are now the oldest remaining all-male insti-
tution in the nation, we should remain that way—‘to provide
a choice” for men desiring such an environment. If the dis-
contented want girls around all the time (so the argument
runs), they should have gone elsewhere.

The pro-coeducation stance rests mainly on these points,

(1) W&L as an

environment for learning. Since the established trend is away

all-male institution is an “unnatural”
from strong fraternities and toward more varied lifestyles,
the university ought to adjust to that trend.

(2) The introduction of girls would be an educational plus,
both in the classroom and out. Furthermore, the requisite
strengthening of the arts and humanities would be, in them-
selves, a counter to an overemphasis on professional training.

(3) The enrollment increase called for by

The pro-coed camp has not been without its shrill voices.
When Betty Freidan came crusading for feminism here last
week, she exclaimed that precluding girls from W&L was
“unjust discrimination” —designed to prohibit women from
access to the power structure.

We do not subseribe to Mrs. Friedan’s nosy generaliza-
tions; nor do we feel that coeducation is a realistic prospect

because we feel it would best serve the future of W&L as an
institution,

Everyone who has come here, arrived aware of W&L's all-
tale status, that is true. But if a considerable segment of the
student body decided, after experiencing the all-male environ
ment, that they were dissatisfied, then a basic questioning of
the desirability of remaining all-male would be in order,

Coeducation should not be a campaign issue. Nor should
it take finaneial priority over a new library and other facets
of the present fund drive. But changes are oecuring at WAI

Good gracious, Martha, is nothing sacred? A foldout of Betty Friedan in

the Ring-tum Phil!!

Con

lo the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Dr. Hodges and his allies in the
student body are once again in the
process of waging what has become
a perrennial crusade to bring down
this last great bastion of what they
might style “male chauvinism.”
Each year the same arguments are
paraded in hopes that this time,
perhaps, the opposition might just

stay in bed and not turn out to
vote against coeducaiton. Thank-
fully that has not yet happened.
WAL students have in the past

looked beyond the alluring but shal-
low benefits which coeducation
seems to offer and have voted down
the proposal whenever it has been
brought up before them.

The ultimate danger in coedtica-
tion is expansion, We are all familiar
with the lines in the introductory
section of the catalogue, “WAL is.
by choice, small.” and for many of
us. the factor of W&L's student
body size was an important draw-
ing card. There is an obvious ad-
vaniage derived from attending a
university where one's professor
knows him as a person rather than
as a number on an attendance sheet;
yet all of us know that the 11:1
student to faculty ratio trumpeted
about by the administration is con
tnually becoming more elusive than
ever, particularly when one is con-
fronted by the size of some of our
classes. Coeducation, with its ulti
mate menace in student body size,
would do anything but alleviate the
siitlation

What then, too, of housing? Co

education would require that new
dormitories be built to house the
imecoming women students. Never

mind the fact that there is a hous-
ing shortage here already for un
male students. If coeduca
tion is to come, women's residence
halls would have to take priority
over all other building projecis, in
cluding the new undergraduate
library and the renovation of old

No, the money to finance coeduca-
tion will not come from alumni
contributions. it will come from
tuition imereases, and large tuition
increases at that. The burden will be
on us. The financial burden will be
upon us, primarily,

I think we have to be pragmatic
when we look at coeducation. To
hide behind their arguments that an
all-male school is an “unreal” aca-
demic environment, and therefore
undesireable, is facetious as well as
a blatant attempt to ignore the hard,
cold implications of what coeduca-
tion will truly hold for W&L. At
such time as the faculty contains a
proportionate perceniage of hard
hats, cab drivers, farmers, mechan-
ics—and, oh yes, a fundamentalist
on one of the chairs of religion—
then we can sit down and talk
about the pro's and con's of “real”
and “ureal” academic environments.
Uniil then I trust that WAL students
will continue to look through this
haze of philosophical gymnastics,
and consider whal coeducation
means practically for themselves and
for the University’s future. Doing
so, | think most students will vote
no on coeducation next Monday

that it is fallacious to argue that

being the case, how can anyone

Obviously, there are countervail-
ing opinions to the notion of going

financial reasons and staying male
for traditional purposes seem to be
chef among them. I submit that the
former can be overcome with a
sense of purpose, and that the latier
argument is an argument from
emotion rather than reason. I took
strong exception to Lewis Powell's
statement printed in the Phi fast
when in addressing the Uni-
versity Committee, he said we had
a “duty” to the nation to provide
an all-male school of high academic
quality. Nonsense. Our duty is to
ourselves both as the student body
and as individuals. Our commitment
ought to be that we strive for
academic excellence as a small, lib-
university. Before con-
siructing new buildings we should
seek a more diversified student body.

Coeducation: Pros and Cons...

In conclusion, Ud have to say that
my experience at W&L has been
positive, all things considered. How-
ever, | would neither recommend
this school to my brother nor re-
cruit for it if asked, unless women
are admitted. This is but one man’s
opinion, but one that been to ail-
male schools and a coed one in his
education. The day has arrived to
“molt the skin” step into the real
world, improve the school, and
rightfully establish our position in
the upper stratum of American
higher education. Gentlemen, vote
yes for coeducation.

the rhetoric of a Betty Freidan and

W hat’s Really Wrong withW@L...

A Country Club Superpoll

By J. JASON MATTHEWS

In response to a set of ques-
tionaires distributed to a random
selection of students, a sense of dis-
content has been ascertained in the
student body, The questionaire, pro-

fessionally compiled, dealt with
many facets of life here on the
W&L campus and what, if any-
thing, could be done to alleviate

those things which annoyed students.
Instead of using check marks or
short answer questions, we felt that
middle-length essays would not only
answer the question, but would give
us a sense of what the student is
fecling deep down in his heart.
For the most part, the essays were
lucid and well-written, destroying
in our estimation, the rumor that
10% of the student-graduates from
W&L leave unable to read or speak
at a fast pace.

Without a doubt, the thing that
irked most students was the pro-
vision for parking. Many felt a
“sense of dispair” while others ad-

mitted feeling like Teutencahmen
after the stone had been crowbared
into the “seal” position. One par-

ticularly distressing letter mentioned
the advent of “a day of reckon-
ing when the fools of the world
will be dealt with and shown no
mercy.” Specifics mention those
architectually aesthetic grass islands
which jut out and eliminate two
whole spaces as especially aggravat-
ing.

Next on the list is strangely
enough, the record store in the base-
ment of the Co-op. Many complain-
ed of “being driven crazy” by the
three-day take home trial system of
listening to The general
conensus is that to trust the students
so implicitly is an irritating dis-
play and that “stricter rules with
sign-up sheets and “penalty fines”
be instituted. One particularly dis-

records,

tressed student calls this practice
“an inhumane  reverse-psychology
technique only a madman would
use.”

tricky problem of
University-Lexington relations
figures is the next most common
grievance, namely the massive trac-
tor-trailers which roar up and down
Route 60 at all hours of the night.
Not only is the obvious noise fac-
tor disturbing but the danger repre-
sented by these monoliths of the
highway poses a real threat to stu-
dents. One such student swears that
he was pinned to the side of David-
for 2 minutes as first the
“advance green” trucks roared down

The obviously

son S

past him and then the “delayed
green” trucks scorched back up the
hill. One anonymous note claims
that the slipstream sucked a stu-

dent's Irish Setter under the wheels
of one of the “big-rigs” and smeared
it from the Post Office to the
Keydet-General before he could
make a move to rescue his hapless

pet,

Finally the last major complaint
which showed up as being a com-
mon source of annoyance was the
footbridge linking the Gym with
Wilson Field. Most complained that
they felt the bridge's anonymity was
undeserved,

“After all,” wrote one student,
“Don't we have the longest unsus-
pended footbridge in the world?”
Proposals to write to Travel maga-
zine or the National Geographic
were numerous, One inventive indi-
vidual suggested painting it in day-
glo paint so that “airplanes above
could look down and tell people
what it was.” Another distressingly
abrupt student advocated assasinat-
ing someone and telling the press
about the footbridge while being
interviewed for nation-wide  tele-
vision news,

While the list of grievenances now
becomes more _ individualistically
oriented, some interesting contri-
butions are visible, The short list
clarifies this point.

One student complained of the
Dopler Effect created by the walls
of the Quad which shatter his win-
dows, drinking glass, and Carmen
Miranda picture frame almost three
times a week.

One Psychology major expresses
extreme bitterness at the deliberate
electrocution of a white rat which
he had grown, “more than fond of.”
He claims others were “insanely
jealous of our happiness and tried
their best to make the few blissful

moments we had together miser-
able.”
A transfer student from Ran-

dolph-Macon complains that she 1s
being harrassed when she undresses
in front of her window at 135
Main Street every night between
11:00 and midnight by one or two
perverted Peeping Toms. (The win-
dow with the light pink curtains.)

An especially pious student gets
angry at those people who go to
church every Sunday but, “don't
really mean it.” He suggests a dunk-
ing stool be erected to test sin-
cerity; those “who sink are O.K.
but those who float should be burn-
ed in the Church's bar-b-que pit after
the service,”

Lastly, another transfer student
from Sweet Briar seems to feel that
there is an, “inordinate amount of
chauvinism and an atmosphere of
male superiority which always seems
to hinder the making of friends and
meeting of boys around campus.”
She is willing to share her spacious
apartment with any “liberal-minded
boy who is not hesitant to experi-
ment in inter-personal relations, who
does not look forward to any com-
mitments, and who does not  con-
demn todays ‘free morality’ as per-
verted or unnatural, but feels it is

rather, healthy and invigorating.”
She adds that, “the learning ex-
perience is so important that it

Tx TLL

justifies risks too numerous to men-
tion.” If any boy is. Please contact
Joan Allenby at 463-0786,

With this, the list of student com-
plaining comes to a swift close, The
founding fathers of America in the
Declaration of Independence stated,
that every man has certain un-
alienable rights, Well I'm pretty sure
they meant students too, although
| know some people who would
give that argument a good run for
it's money. Each student, a highly
tuned instrument capable of absorb-
ing enormous amounts of complex
material for short periods of time,
cperates on a delicate balance. If
this balance is in any way disrupted,
Poof! there goes the student. Apo-
plexied extermities, rolling eyeballs,
flaking, scaling, and small crusty
patches on skin or scalp. I main-
tain that the University’s primary
function is to coddle the student,
with a soft layer of sdwathing
to surround his “baby intellect”
clothes. Believe me what I'm telling
you, | know! Goo-goo.

Short story-writer Barbara Deming seen above at a recent meeting with Fidel Castro, will be one of the
participants in a three day symposium begining today on “the woman of letters.” The symposium was brought
to W&L by the Glasgow Endowment Program,

Friedan’s Message For W&L

By W. PATRICK HINELY

For starters, a sidelight to the
historic occasion of Contact's first
women speaker: President Huntley
was the man who first suggested
to the Contact committee the idea
of having a woman speaker,

After delving through a bit of
well-put propoganda and plenty of
facts and examples of generaliza-
tions, Betty Friedan’s basic message
to us here at W&L, the oldest all-

male school in America, is clear
and simple: Change or be left
behind.

Ms. Friedan wasn't talking about
how things could be so much as
she was talking about how things
already are in the real world, i.e.,
in non-artificial sexually unsegregat-
ed places. Today more than ever
before, W&L is the proverbial
escape from the outside world. As
it is now, we are taking part in a
four-year cop-out under the auspices
of education.

Ms. Friedan pretty well destroyed
the myth of W&L by showing it for
what it is. The picture she painted
of an all-male world is, especially
for a place like this, sorry but
accurale,

What Ms. Friedan
about was a change in attitudes.
Her basic beliefs throw a lot of
what we live by out the window,
for reasons of sexism. The W&L
gentleman becomes, in her eyes, an
obselete social peculiarity.

The world she envisoins is one of
humans together, as people, not
specifically as men and women,
though the natural functions of sex

was talking

differences’ will undoubtedly remain
the source of much interest and
recreation, and of course procrea-
tion.

But what she was trying to get
across is that sex i.e., sexual inter-
course and any attachments it might
have, has been grossly misused and
exaggerated in our society. Think
about that the next time you're
checking out this month's play-
mate with your door locked and
whatever else you might be doing...

Not to demean the pleasure of
an orgasm, what she was saying
is that it is nothing more than a
good feeling, and that like anything
else that is good, it should be
shared, Sex in general is just one
facet of a diad relationship, be it
male-female, maleanale, female-
female, or whatever.

So next time you've got
litle honey in your bunk, make
sure she want to be there and
that both of you get off on what's
happening. This involves looking at

that

things a litthe more deeply than
many of us do now,
It means seeing a woman (girl,

chick, whatever) as more than just
a semen receptacle. She's your
friend, too, or should be.

If you really have any meaning-
ful feelings of affection for some-
one, whoever it is qualifies for the
label of “friend.” How do you treat
your friends? And more important,
who are you a friend to?

Of course, it's hard to live by
this when women are around in
such small numbers on an every-
day basis. We all live for the future,

some say, and on a short-term basis,
especially on Monday's. This means
figuring out how to have a good
time come Friday. So by Friday,
you thave clean sheets on the bed
and a pile of good records wait-
ing, the booze or grass ready for

convenient use, and the groovy
lights all ready ot go at the filck

of a switch,

That's not how it works. Cer-
tainly, any luxuries should always
be at your disposal, but remember:
people don't fit that category.

Ms. Friedan has foresight; too
much of it in the eyes of one girl
who questioned her in Lee Chapel,
who claimed that the Women’s
Rights Movement really hasn't got-

RING-TUM PHI

Get Out Of The CAC

In spite of another sterling performance by Washington
and Lee athletes at the “Winter Sports Festival,” or perhaps
because of it, it is time to take a long hard look at the
College Athletic Conference, and this university's role in it.
W&L ran away with the swimming crown, grabbed the
wrestling title, and finished a close second in basketball. The
Generals won the “big bell” last year, and are well on their
way to keeping it in Doremus. But does anybody care?

Founded in 1962, the CAC gave W&L an organized league
in which to compete. In particular, it filled the need that this
school had for a football conference. The CAC expanded, at
one time, into a rather vital organization, But in the last few
years it has deteriorated into a shell of a competitive con-
ference,

The latest “festival” showed once again the many weak-
nesses of the College Athletic Conference, The tourneys were
held on the “Mountain,” in Sewanee, Tennessee, a mere eight
hour bus ride from Lexington. Washington and Lee teams
left on a Wednesday and stayed until Sunday. They stayed
in a Holiday Inn, and “ate steak every night.” All this ex-
pense to compete against two other swimming squads, and
three teams in basketball and wrestling.

Time is another factor in this competition, Unfortunately,
W&IL athletes are students as well as “jocks.” Five days is
a lot of time to be away “from the books.” Combined with
distance and lack of inter-school relationships, time prevents
W&L from developing any kind of vigorous rivalry with any
of the CAC schools. It all boils down to—who really cares
if we win the CAC’s and bring home the “big bell”?

Earlier this year, Athletic Director Bill McHenry
nounced the formation of the VCAA, and with it W&L has
found the necessary replacement for the CAC. Financially,

all-

the costs will be minimal. The Associaiton can only promote
rivalries which have already begun, or which will form natur-
ally, W&L students cannot help but be more interested in a
win over Hampden-Sydney or Madison than a victory over
Centre. These are schools with which we have more in com-
mon than affiliation with the same conference. These are
people W&L students know, and are in competition with,

VCAA championships have so far been dominated by
W&L, with the exception of track. But there is promise for
the future. Interest is high, and all schools seem to be behind
the program.

With this in mind, we reccomend that Washington and
Lee withdraw from the CAC and concentrate on the VCAA.

W&L Lacrosse Opens Sat.

By RAY SWAN

Washington and Lee's lacrosse
team opens its 1973 season this
Saturday ‘against Morgan State at
Wilson Field. On Monday, Notre
Dame will invade Lexington for a
scrimmage.

The Generals will field a team
made up largely of juniors and
seniors, all veterans of several suc-
cessful seasons. New head coach
Jack Emmer is confident of the
team’s success, and stressed the im-
portance of the first half of the
season. “The question is, how fast

can we develop our new system?”
In addition to Morgan State and
Notre Dame, W&L will face the
Washington Lacrosse Club and a
formidable list of opponents in the
Hero’s Tournament, March 22-25—
Hobart, Cornell, Maryland, Virginia,
Towson and Brown. All these teams
were ranked high in the national
polls last year.

W&L will play several teams for
the first time. C. W. Post, a Long
Island team, will give the Generals
an opportunity to recruit up north.
Princeton is also on the schedule

for the first time and should be a
strong team, having lost to Cornell
last year by only one point, 9-8,
Princeton will be one of the Ivy
League's best teams, along with
Cornell and Brown. Returning on
the schedule will be Towson, which
Emmer called one of the toughest
teams the Generals will face.

Emmer feels the Generals are
strongest on offense. “We'll definitely
get the goals, but I'm defensively
minded, It’s the defense that bails
you out when your offense is hav-
ing a bad day.” The coach feels
that W&L has superior stickhandlers
than his teams at Cortland St.

Emmer stressed the importance of
conditioning. A member of the la-
crosse staff said the team was being
worked very hard. Emmer said that
despite the tough workouts, there
has been no attrition, and the team
has responded well both to the con-
ditioning and the burden of learn-
ing a new coaching system.

While acknowledging W&L’s
past lacrosse record, Emmer noted
that the Generals have not won the
big games against such opponents
as Navy and Virginia. “I'd like to
see us win the tough games by one
or two goals instead of losing by

W&L Wrestlers Defeated
In NCAA College Meet

By PAUL SIMPSON

Last Friday and Saturday, Lee
Keck and Doug Ford wrapped up
Washington and Lee's wrestling
schedule when they journeyed to
South Dakota State University to
represent the Generals in the NCAA
meet.

Lee Keck, wrestling at 118
pounds lost in this first match on
a riding time decision by a one
point margin, 7-6.

Doug Ford also lost his first
match. Ford wrestled at 167 pounds

and lost by an 8-1 score, Both
Keck and Ford were eliminated
from further competition after
their first loss,

On the year, Keck’s record of
16-8-2 was surpassed ‘by Ford's,
19-5; Overdorff, 12-2-1; White, 11-
3-2; Melton, 10-4-2; Stieff, 12-3-1

and Lewis, 11-5-1 (all except Keck
and Ford’s are only for dual meets.)

The team as a whole sported a
13-5 record and among its accolades
were a first place in the VCAA, a

Z

Doug Ford fell 8-1 in his first match. A

 

first in the CAC championships and
a fourth in the Lebanon Valley
Invitational Tournament,

Coach John Piper said that na-
turally he was very happy with the
way the season developed and that
he was looking forward to stiffer
competition next season, Coach
Piper went on to say that the team
has “taken a big step in two years”
and that it “will be tough to keep
up the napid pace” of development.

In Piper's opinion, the biggest
upset W&L pulled off all season was
the Duke match where W&L came
out on the winning side of a 22-20
score. This was undoubtedly the
season’s most exciting match. On
the gloomier side, Piper considered
the loss to Pembroke State the
most disappointing.

With the General's winning atti-
tude now firmly — instilled, and

though continually good recruiting
by Piper, W&L’s wrestling future
appears to be a long line of solid,
winning teams.

   

 

sophomore, the 167 pounder

will be back next year. Coach Piper foresees an even better squad next
year. With another good recruiting year, W&L’s grappling future

appears to be bright,

on the track and agility in the field
resulted in an easy team victory
for them in the eight-team meet
Competition for second place was
much closer, however, as only five
points separated second-place Lynch-
burg from fifth-place W&L. Roa-
noke’s Bill Warner led from the
start to capture the mile as did
Virginia State's Tom Anderson in
the 600 yard run in the meet’s most
impressive victories. Following close
to Anderson in second was W&L’s
Brandon Herbert, who later finish-
ed an outstanding indoor season by
an horing the mile relay to second
behind powerful Virginia State.
Providing the momentum for him
on the preceeding legs were Phifer

Helms, Dave Lawson, and fresh-
man Willie-Bob Wingfield.
Paul Suthern continued his im-

pressive hurdling by taking second
in the highs and fourth in the lows,
Once again VSC was the spoiler
winning the highs and placing
second and third on the lows, Bill
Kalal’s fourth place finish in the
two mile provided the only other
points on the track for WAL.

The field event men gained sev-
eral crucial points for the Generals.
Shotputters Phil Jones and Bob
Fallis placed third and fourth while
Paul Hartmann pole-vaulied to a
third place finish. Frank Porter
atoned for a previously frustrating
season when he took third in the
high jumps. Barclay Armstrong
triple-jumped and long-jumped his
way to two fifth-places.

Despite several excellent individ-
val performances, the fifth-place
finish was a disappointment to the
team, Entering the meet as a top
contender, the Generals were un-
able to exhibit the depth which
produced their previous wins, most
notably the Lynchburg Relays. The
outdoor season, however, appears
promising. Many of the distance
runners as well as the field event
men are beginning to reach their
top form after two months of con-
ditioning. The sprinters and hurdlers
successfully competed among the
best in the state and the outdoor

Revamped WEGL Ruggers
Open Season With ODU

The W&L rugby team opened
practice on Monday, Feb. 26 and,
according to player-coach Larry
Cohen, there will be a number of
changes designed to produce a win-
ning season.

One big change will be that the
players will have their own practice
field at Lylburn-Downing Elemen-
tary School. “We feel that practicing
during the day on a_ full-sized
field as opposed to last fall’s night
practice, will go a long way to
helping our timing and condition-
ing,” said Cohen. “In addition there
will be a great number of personnel
changes, especially among our backs.
We have ‘been doing some extremely
active recruiting this winter and the
effects should show up in both the
size and conditioning of our play-
ers.”

There is a good possibility that
the only backs who were on last
fall's “A” team who will remain
this spring will be Cohen at scrum
half and co-captain Ron Vaught at
wing. “We have some excellent ex-
perienced backs who are coming out
from other fall sports and several
men who had left school and have
now returned,” commented Cohen.
Leading candidates include junior
Rob Konwinski at flyhalf, a very
quick experienced player who was
injured most of last spring; alumnus
Rob Hessler at center, one of the
stars of last spring's fine showing at
the National Championships and
an extremely quick starter and hard
hitter; sophomore Jeff Davies who
gained his rugby experience in South
Africa; Jay Costan at wing, a sec-
ond year law student who has played
the position for three years at Uni-
versity of Virignia; and Bob Cook,
a starter at wing in 1971 who has

now returned to school,

Among the scrum or line there
will be stiff competition for start-
ing spots as veteran props Sam
Lewis and John Weigel battle with
Arch Christian and Ed McLaughlin.
The second row positions will be
up for grabs among Tom Mc-
Junkin, Jeff Burke, Dave Johnson
and Arch Frierson, all of whom go
over 200 pounds. Lock will prob-
ably be chosen from among Dave
Campbell, Hunt Harding or Scott
Brown, all of whom have seen ex-
perience at the position, Campbell
and Harding may have the inside
track, however, because of their
greater height. The key position of
hooker will probably belong to
three-year veteran Steve Sutton, al-
though he will be pushed by senior
Ray McGrath and sophomore Skip
Whitehurst.

Fullback, a vital position will
probably develop into a battle be-
tween veteran Scott Brown and
junior Rolf Piranian, According to
Cohen, “Piranian is a natural for
fullback. He can kick well with
both feet, is extremely quick and
will probably be one of the hardest
hitters on the team.” His biggest
disadvantage will be lack of ex-
perience in a pressure position.

The wing forward or lineback-
ing positions will be competed for
by veterans Taylor Marion; Jim
Kahn, co-captain; Jim Telling and
Bucky Leslie. “We had a great deal
of trouble at this spot last fall,”
said Cohen. “this will be a position
that will be nailed down by a person
who is in the best shape and who
is the hardest hitter regardless of
his experience.”

Coeducation Vote To Be Monday

standardized multifariousness, ‘The
student genuinely interested in an
all men’s institution of higher learn-
ing has now only a handful of
schools remaining from which to
select,

We here at Washington and Lee,
in view of this deplorable situation,
must consider the issue of coeduca-
tion not only in light of our great
heritage but in terms of the survival
of choice; the preservation of what
we, as an all-men’s college, have to
otter.

rhe burden of selfless objectivity

Con

lo the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

This letter concerns an event
which is becoming as traditional as
Pavilion grain parties and Fancy
Dress. | am speaking of the an-
nual student referendum on coeduca-
tion. The advocates of this edu-
cational philosophy extole its ab-
stract “virtues” and are content to
ignore its possible material effects
on an institution such as Washing-
ion and Lee.

An example of this abstract way
of thinking was provided by an
eminent faculty member of the Uni-
versity Council who, in last year’s

ten anywhere, Ms, Friedan spoke
back to her from the viewpoint of
a decade of experience, saying pro-
gress has been made, that the ice-
cap is starting to melt. Ms, Friedan
was working on reform before this

chick was even wearing a bra,

much less thinking about burning §

it

In essence, Ms. Friedan made a
point which Johnny White did dur-
ine Black Culture week and that
Dick Gregory spoke of also, That
point is that our viewport is limit-
ed by the present makeup of the
W&L “community.” We are de-
prived of different persepetives by
the fact that we have too much in
common: we are all white males.

When we get out of here, we're
going to have a hard time relating
to blacks and women in the “real”
world because we have seen so
little of them,

You can shrug all this off and stick
to any outmoded ways you might
have, but make you're not
alone. because when you paint your
self into a corner, you're going to
need a lot of help getting out.

Step one of the de-juvenation and
rejuvenation of W&L is next Mon-
day. | would say we should all
critically examine our status quo
and its shortcomings before approv-
ing its preservation.

debate on the subject stated that
“We should first decide whether co-
education as a philosophy is desir-
able. Then we can study its possible
cost to and effects on W&L.” My
point is that one cannot separate
the concept from the effects of its
concrete application.

Nhe present plan of the Com-
mittee to Study Coeducation calls
for the expansion of W&L’s under-
graduate enrollment to 1800, or an
increase of 28%. One would as-
sume that all of the additional 400
students would sign up for classes.
Yet, I have heard no mention of
any proposed corresponding — in-
crease in the size of the W&L
faculty, The professor quoted above
has stated that the enlargement of
a closs from 45 to 60 students
would (or should) have no effect
on the way in which the class is
conducted. Granted, in some large
100-level lecture courses these addi-
tional students would cause no prob-
lems. I just hope that, should
WAL ever decide to “go coed,” this
professor will be able to persuade
all 400 coeds not to enroll in any
courses where individual attention
would be hampered by substantial
increase in class size.

We are fooling ourselves if we
think that W&L’s excellent is based
merely on its convenient location,
its excellent faculty, and its fabulous
facilities. The location is bearable,
the professors are excellent, and the
facilities are—for the most part—
adequate. However, it is the avail-
ability of these professors and these
facilities to all students (an avail-
ability unheard of in larger schools)
that makes Washington and Lee the
fine institution that it is.

only points by placing fifth in the
high hurdles—no small accomplish-
ment considering the class competi-
tion and several false starts by his
opponents, Bill Kalal’s 9:56 two
mile, his first time under 10 minutes,
was another bright spot. W&L’s
mile relay of Brandon Herbert,
Dave Estes, Phifer Helms, and Dave
Lawson withdrew, however, due to
Lawson's pulled muscle incurred in
an afternoon 440 trial.

William and Mary repeated its
powerful performance of last year
by easily running away with the
team tithe as well as several individ-
ual championships. Most of their
can be contributed to a
strong squad of runners which cap-
tured the hurdles, 600, 880, and
mile; an example of their superior
depth was displayed in the mile
where they placed four of the first
5 finishers—a sweep imerrupted only
by Roanoke’s Bill Warner and his
desperation last-lap finish. The indi-
vidual star of the meet was the
University of Virginia's Paul Meyer.
After winning the three mile in the
afternoon, he returned that evening
to capture the two-mile in record
time, easily outsprinting his three
William and Mary opponents.

For Dance Board Post

T. Barry Davis

For many people here at W&L,
the Dance Board has been just
another body of people that wants
to take money and give nothing in
return. There have been numerous
promises made and every year those
promiss are neatly stashed away
until it becomes necessary to bring
them out again.

This year we were enticed to buy
a dance plan by a notice which
stated that we might be treated to
such acts as America, Paul Mce-
Cartney, or Argent. Have we seen
anything more about there groups?

The fact remains that only public
promoters could possible stage such
acts which up to $20,000 a
night. We don't have the re-
sources here for a weekend concert
of that caliber.

There are possibilities, however,
of having a weeknight concert in the
spring because the musicians charge
less—but this must be approved by
the administration, and so far we've
had very little luck

Averill Harkey

My name is Averill Harkey and
1 am a candidate for the office of
president of your student body, It
is not my intention in this brief
introduction to falsely convey to
you all of those pseudo-political
promises that are so characteristic
of such a campaign. The reason for
this being that the president of the
student body here at Washington
and Lee is not in a position to ful-
fill such promises.

One of the most effective ways to
decide “issues,” such as coeduca-
tion, is to poll the students and
then let me take your opinions be-
fore the Executive Commitee, Uni-
versity Council and the administra-

tion,

Having been on the varsity debate
team here for three years, I feel
that | can take your policy stands
and persuasively convert them to
the appropriate body of our govern-
ment. The important point to re-
member however is that you are
the one that has ask for the changes
to take place,

Only now, with this functional
representative government, as op-
posed to the oligarchial elitist efforts
of the past, will we be able to get

Referenda.

Balloting for these will be on Tuesday, as well.

things done, It is my feeling that
What you, the reader, have experi-
enced, or rather not experienced,
from past and present governments
is communication from these gov-
ernments,

You have elected leaders that
have promised changes, and when
these changes can not be met isn’t
convienient how silent these “lead-
ers” become? It is because once
elected these officers can hide be-
hind their jobs and not reveal to
us, the students, what is going on.

Communication is essential to a
representative student body. But
why is it that the students feel
foggy as to what the Executive Com-
mitee actually does? A convenient
explanation is tacked on to those
in such a fix, It is interesting to
note that those students who pes-
simistically proclaim Washington
and Lee as an apatheitic campus are
indeed themselves the most apathe-
tic. This proposal of apathy just
isn't documented. Why the very fact
that you are reading this letter
circumvents the apathy approach.

A lack of communication from
responsive leaders is why the W&L
student is uninformed. Give me the
chance to let you know what we
can do as students to improve Wash-
ington and Lee and I promise you

that together we will get things
done!

To the Student Body:

The President of the Student Body
has major responsibilities relating
to the well being of Washington
and Lee and its students. These
include presiding over the Execu-
tive Committee, serving on the Uni-
versity Council (historically as co-
chairman), and representing the Stu-
dent Body at Trustees’ meetings.
The student holding this office is
also the primary medium through
which students maintain a rapport
with the faculty and administration.

Although all of these duties are
important, that which pertains to
the Executive Committee is the most
consequential. The EC serves a dual
function—it is the students’ principal
legislative body, an dit exercises
exclusive jurisdiction over the Honor
System. This year the EC inaugu-
rated two wide-ranging policies in
these areas, both of which were
long overdue.

The first of these was the active
role assumed by the EC, along with
the Freshman Dormitory Counse-
lors, in Freshman Orientation re-
garding the Honor Sysiem. The
second involved an in-depth analysis
and reallocaiton of the Student Tax.
Both policies reflect the recognition
by the EC of the importance of
continual updating and reevalution
of the needs of the school.

My candidacy for Student Body
President is founded upon two be-
Firsi—that responsive student
represenetation at WA&L depends
upon the continuation of
the policies outlined above, but more
importantly upon the progressive
spirit of student government through

I am seeking the office of presi-
dent because | can no longer sit
back and ignore the sad state of
affairs of student government here
at Washington and Lee. Those of
you who have taken the time to
seriously reflect on the present situa-
tion will, | am sure, have reached
the same conclusion: Student gov-
ernment here is no government at
all, but a means of furthering the
narrow career interests of those few
individuals who manage to get them-
selves elected to its offices,

How tragic it is when we con-
sider that it was only a few short
years ago that we were able to
form a government, a government
with the express purpose of repre-
senting our concerns and interests
before the faculty and administra-
tion, a government that many hoped
would speak with a loud and clear
voice. How tragic it is that today
we find this government incapable
of even so much as uttering a
whimper when it come to student
interests, but highly capable and
efficient when it comes time to elect
each other to Who's Who.

It is time to put an end to this
monkey business. Those of you who
know me know that I am not a
political man. Before today I have
never sought a political office,

But let us not fool ourselves;
the other candidates now running
for office, while they have experi-
ence, have quite clearly demonstrat-
ed wha tthe nature of that experi-
ence is: “Rule and change nothing.”
This, however, is precisely what we
do need—change.

I make it the central issue of my
platform. Yes, | am familiar with
all the otf issues—from co-educa-
tion ot the honor code, and even
some the other candidates haven't
thought about—but what good goes
it do to talk about all these things
if we fail to realize that the very
nature of student government as it
exist today will virtually assure that
none of them come to pass?

If | am elected president, 1
promise to devote all my energies
to making the student government
something we can again be proud
of, a government not afraid to speak
up, and a government that is repre-
sentative of all the students—not
just the few.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Five Students Compete for EC Secretary

Paul Cavaliere

Having almost completed my third
year at Washington and Lee I feel
that | have finally reached the point
where | am qualified to run for a
Student Body office. Throughout
these three years I have, at one time
or another, (associated with many
diverse segments of the W&L com-
munity, Both the fraternity and non-
fraternity, the athletic and the non-
athletic, the freshmen and the up-
perclassmen, the studious and the
not so studious, | have made firm
and lasting contacts with members
of each of these segments. Through
these contacts I will be able to re-
late each group's problems or praise
to the Executive Committee as they
are expressed to me. These contacts
take more than two years to de-
velop and that is why I feel | am
qualified for the position of Student
Body Secretary. Please give me your
consideration,

Bob Keatley

The office of Student Body Sec-
retary is one which entails both a
great deal of time and work and
a fairly knowledgeable awareness
of how the Executive Committee is
structured. Having served on the
University Council as a freshman
and currently on the EC as a
sophomore. I feel that I am aware
of the demands of the office of
Secretary makes on an individual
and also the functions that the EC
is responsible for.

One of the primary objectives a
Secretary should have concerns the
freshman orientation during the first
few weeks of the fall term. He
should be aware that the success or
the failure of the EC is acquainting
freshmen with the Honor System is
one of the most important tasks he
will be responsible for as secretary.
A great deal of planning must go
into this orientation, particularly
over the summer, and I am willing
to put Whatever amount of time into
planning that is necessary to insure
its success in September.

in working with the EC, | have
become aware that it is very im-
portant for an EC member to main-
tain a good rapport with the student
body. The Honor System functions
only so long as the student body
feels it is relevant to themselves and
their university. To me it is im-
portant that the student body think
of the officers and the EC mem-
bers as individuals and not as a
select group aloof to student opinion
and sentiment. | do not see how an
Executive Committee could hope to
function effectively if it is not aware
of student opinion through personal
effort and consideration. Knowing
that aloofness can greatly impair
the effectiveness of an EC, I feel
1 would work to avoid anything
of this sort.

Realizing that much time is re-
quired of the Secretary and having
definite opinions about how a Seere-
tary should respond and act in his

Although the EC will have very
little to say in whether or not W&L
goes co-ed, I suppose I am ex-
pected to give my stand on the
issue. | am against coeducation,
Be sides the obvious dangers of
alumni alienation, cost, and reduced
male enrollment, there are social
dangers. Females doubtlessly have
value, but the proposition that it
is in the classroom is another nvat-
ter altogether. The small advant-
ages we might receive on the hill
would be more than offset by the
holocaust it would bring upon many
of our off-the-hill traditions which
make up a great deal of what W&L
uniquely is. With the exchange pro-
gram and Betty Friedan creeping
feminism has advanced far enough.

Another of this year’s great issues
has been the disbursal of EC funds
to special groups for recruitment.
There is a standing Recruitment
Committee and if recruitment is to
be done, it should be done by this
committee, not by groups. If one
group is granted funds, no group
can justifiably be denied them.
Merit. of course, should remain the
primary criterion in admissions.

Since | am now a Junior, you
can be sure that I won't use this
office to seek a higher one, When
this election is over, never again
will you see my name on a single
campaign poster on this campus.

Everett Martin

David Rigby

The office of Secretary of the

Student Body is not one which
requires “past experience.” What is
needed is a desire to work for

and with students as individuals and
as a group. To this desire I add
my consistent attendance at Execu-
tive Committee meetings which has
left me well acquainted with the
operation of student government.

What Washington and Lee needs
is a sense of community. The first
step in this direction is the ob-
servance of the Honor System. To
complement the effective orienta-
tion of freshmen in this area, there
should also be a re-orientation off-
ered for upperclassmen. For ex-
ample, everyone feels that indepen-
dent exams are helpful and should
remain in practice. This is just not
possible if we have an honor system
that is flagrantly violated. Students
should abide by the System not be-
cause they feel it is their duty, but
because they want to,

What I propose is to have an
EC of action and stimulation, When
that group takes an official stand,
that counts. Such a position should
be taken on any and all issues Which
are of importance to the students,
This includes co-education, the
state-of-the-arts,” the curriculum,
attendance at faculty meetings, re-
cruitmem, and financial matters.
The students have a right to de-
mand all information they desire on
subjects of their immediate concern

What we the students need is not
a return to the WAL Country Club
but student action and involvement
1 ask your help to bring a sense of
community to our campus, Prove
to skeptics that Washington and Lee
students are not apathetic, Instead
of simply students, let's become
friends and bring back the word
trust,

President of the

Ben Sherman

The Executive Committee of the
Student Body is the administrator
of the Honor System, the regulator
of campus activities, and the legisla-
tive arm of the student body. It
is my concern that the EC, in its
legislative capacity, is mot being
active enough in seeing that student
needs and concerms are being heard,
understood, and acted upon.

The office of Student Body Scre-
tary is a position on the EC which
can promote a better understanding
of student needs, That position is
one that involves a good deal of
time and work to see that student
needs are met.

There are many areas on which
student concern should focus.
Among these areas are such diverse
concerns as second hand texts, the
entertainment programs, curriculum
changes, the student tax, Freshman
Orientation and the Honor System.

The Executive Committee, to
function effectively, must be aware
of the opinions of students, faculty
and administrators concerning these
and other problems.

lo fulfill these aims, the EC has
to open channels of communication.
To obtain these channels of com-
munication, the EC must be an
active student government—not a
passive one. To be iactive, its mem-
bers must be willing to devote the
time and energy necessary for it to
become active.

1 would hope that you would
carefully consider what the candi-
dates for Secretary have done to
promote student concerns. | would
further hope that I have proven to
you that I have actively promoted
those concerns in the past.

1 hope you will support me in
promoting your concerns in the
future. Thank you for your support.

Constitutional

Referendum

A proposed constitutional
amendment will be on the bal-
lot. The EC passed the pro-
posal unanimously and encour-
ages the student body to pass it
also. The purpose of the amend-
ment is to alter the Constitution
so as to make it compatible with
the 12-12-6 curriculum. The
Constitution thus amended would
require that student body elec-
tions be held one week earlier
in the Winter Term—thereby
preventing a conflict with Winter
Term exams. The details of the
amendment will be available at
every polling booth.

only after such a notion was de-

For Fancy Dress Post

The duties of the President of
Fancy Dress are probably not what
most students imagine them to be.
Since Fancy Dress is basically just
another university big weekend,
there are only two events during the
weekend which concern the student
body as a whole, a concert and a
university cocktail party. It seems
then that as Fancy Dress Weekend

ficance and activity to become just

bilities of the president have like-
wise diminished,

As President of Fancy Dress this
year, | found that my only role in

organizing the concert was that of

Therefore, the main responsibility
of this office seems to be the organi-
zation of the university cocktail
party. This party is financed by
freshman class dues, and thus a per-
son must be chosen in advance in
to arrange for the collection
of this money during freshman ma
triculation, The party this year

House instead of a Zoll

considered to have been superior to

Mills Godwin: Search
For A New Coalition

By BRYAN HATCHETT

When Mills Godwin ran success-
fully for Governor of Virginia in
1965, he was in the unique position
of having the blessing of state De-
mocratic leader, Sen. Harry Byrd
Sr., newly enfranchised Blacks (fol-
lowing the repeal of the poll tax)
and organized labor. It was called
the Godwin coalition.

In 1973, the machine that Sen.
Byrd controlled is no longer in
power—if it indeed exists as a co-
and his sole opponent,
Henry Howell, will

hesive force—
so far, Lt. Gov,
build his candidacy
and Black support.

“| don't think | have changed at
all. | think my party changed,”
Godwin said last night in an inter-
view following his speech to the
Lexington Chamber of Commerce,
He was guest of honor at a banquet
in Evans Dining Hall last night. The
life long Democrat still refers to his
former party with the personal pro-
noun “my,” which may reflect a cer-
tain uneasiness about his recent re-
nouncialion

“At the moment, I am technically

tion, T am not seeking the Repubii-
can nomination, but | will accept

As in the ‘65 race, Godwin is

faced with the problem of bringing
divergent elements behind a single
candidate, Bul, for the same candi

date, who participated in “massive
resistance” in the late 50's and re-
ceived Black support in the 65 gub-
ernatorial race, surely, the fusion of
Republicans and conservative Demo-
crats is not beyond the realm of pos-
sibilities.

His strategy, at this point at least,
apparently is to avoid saying any-
thing that could offend either fac-
tion, His speech, last night, was void
of specific proposals or campaign
promises. Instead, he spoke in gen-
eralities with the paternalistic man-
ner and aristocratic dignity so com-
mon to Virginia governors.

Succumbing to the temptation,
equally characteristic of Virginia
governors, to play up the “heritage”
of the office, Godwin referred to an-
other former governor, Thomas Jef-
ferson. Such a reference is seldom
unappreciated by Chambers of Com-
merce anywhere in the Common-
wealth. And when it is included with
a commendation of President Nix-
on's recent policy statement on law
and order, then all political bases
are covered,

Like Nixon, who he vigorously
supported last November, Godwin
favors the death penalty in some in-

stances. Later, when asked if he
shares Nixon's contempt for “soft
headed judges,” Godwin replied,

“We have an excellent judiciary in
Virginia.”

Junior Lewis Powell will face in-

wartz Thursday in a runoff election
for president of the W&L student
body.

Powell and Schwartz amassed the
most votes of the four candidates
running for the office in Monday's
general elections. Schwartz missed
a majority of the vote—and a vic-
tory in the election—by under five
votes, totalling 634 of the 1273

Proposals Made To Close
Undergraduate, Law Gap

An ad hoe committee of the Exe-
cutive Committee Monday present-
ed a report on the relationship be-
tween the law school and the un-
dergraduate student body. Among
recommendations made by the com-
mittee was one to redistribute fi-
nances of the student government
to give “equitable treatment” to the
law students.

The committee recommended that
the tax on each law student not be
given to several activities which all
students now pay for through the
tax, These activities are the Film
Committee, Ariel, and Calyx. Jeff
Twardy, who along with Henry
Jernigan is co-chairman of the ad
hoc committee, said that this pro-
posal seemed reasonable since the
law students do not really benefit
from any of those activities, Also
indicated in the recommendation
was a decrease in the amount of
each law student's tax going to the
Ring-tum Phi. The
be reduced by over

amount would
two dollars to

Applications are now being ac-
cepted by the Publications Board
for all editorial and business
managerial positions on all of
Washington and Lee's 1973 pub-
lications. Elections will take
place Sunday, March 25, at the
Alumni House at 7 p.m

Positions available to any
member of the student body are
as follows: Editor of the Ring-
tum Phi, Editor of the Calyx,
Business Manager of the Ring-
ium Phi, Business Manager of
the Calyx, and Editor of the
Ariel.

Applicants for any one of these
five positions should plan to ap-
pear in person before the Pub-
lications Board. Applications
should be given to the Presiden
President Bob Wilson or Secre-
tary Drew Staniar. Applications
should include:

a brief letter of

 

intent stating

one dollar per law student.

l'wardy indicated, however, that
part of the law student tax would
still go to university activities which
benefited the law students. Included
in this list were the student body re-
serve fund, the EC's administrative
fund, Contact, and the Publications
Board.

The remainder of the law stu-
dent's tax not going to these would
be allocated to law school functions,
including the Student Bar Associa-
tion, the Law School News, and the
law school's speaker program.

The report mentioned that, at the
presem, the law school’s portion of
the total student tax was $4300, and
only $2100 was allotted to law acti-
vities this year.

The commitiee was formed last
fall to investigate what many saw as
a widening schism between the law
school and the undergraduate school.
Two prime functions of the commit-
tee were to find fundamental causes
of the schism and to recommend

possible actions which could be
taken to alleviate the situation.

The committee's five-page report
cited three primary causes of the
rift between the two schools, The
difference in age between students
of both schools and the fact that
most law students are married tend-
ed to “remove (these students) from
the University community,” accord-
ing to the report.

The report also cited “the number
of law-related, professionalized acti-
vities” of law students as a cause of
the rift. Anticipation of the law
school’s future move into Lewis
Hall, farther away from the heart of
the campus than is Tucker Hall, was
also listed as a cause.

The report also listed several “re-
medial recommendations” to im-
prove communications between the
two schools, Twardy indicated that
efforts are already being made to
revise the freshman law orientation
to emphasize all phases of commun-
ity life, undergraduate and law. He
suggested that the move be recipro-
cated in regard to undergraduate
freshman orientation, to give these
students a grasp of activties in the
law school.

According to Twardy, efforts are
already being made to set up bullet-
in boards of undergraduate activities
in Tucker Hall and of law student
activities near the Co-op to help im-
prove communications

The report also recommended
that no fundamental changes in the
administration of the Honor System
be made at this time. Discussion of
such a topic would be more appro-
priate at a later time, the report in-
dicated, such as after the move to
Lewis Hall.

Discussion of the report was tabl-
ed at Monday's EC meeting until
next Monday, so that all EC mem-
bers would have time to study the
report and the recommendations
therein

The Run-Off

We face a very important run-off election tomorrow, Some

difficult decisions will no doubt be made before students cast

their votes in the therefore,

final Presidential contest; we,
offer a review of the functions of the Student Body Presi-
dnt. Briefly stated, they are as follows:

(1) As representative of the student body at large, he
should support student opinion and be willing to adapt to
changes in it.

(2) As head of the Executive Committee and its subcom-
mittees, he should have grasp the governmental
structure of the university.

(3) As executive of the Honor System, he directs Honor

trials and is expected to carry out the Honor System fully.
(4) As student

he must be able to articulate student sentiment to the Board

representative to the Board Trustees,
in an effective manner.

(5) Likewise, he is the chief bridge between students and
the faculty and administration.
The campaign, up to this point, has presented two candi-
dates who could not be more different—in style, temperament,
and platforms. When we endorsed the coeducation proposal
in these columns last week, we had no idea that Doug Sch-
wartz would be able to catalyze such a gratifying result in
student opinion.

in the feverish atmosphere of this campaign, a genuine stu-

about their choice. The outcome will surely affect more than
the sexual makeup of the student body—but the Honor Sys-
tem and the effectiveness of the student government as well.

Students Treated ‘Fairly?

 

University Faces Drug Problem

By JESS REEVES

The present academic year once
again brings to light the existance of
drugs on campus and in the Wash-
ington and Lee community. This
fact certainly comes as no surprise,
but it does present the question as
to how the university is to react to
this situation. The most recent in-
fraciton of the school’s ban on drugs
in its domitories seems to show that
the university is doing its best to
handle the problem fairly.

Several weeks ago seven fresh-
men found to be in possession of
marijuana by their dormitory coun-
selors, Their case first came before
the Student Control Committee
which is comprised solely of stu-

dents, The SCC heard the case and
recommended the usual penalty for
the freshmen: one month donmitory
probation and conduct probation.
Usually a letter is sent home to the
students parents informing them of
the situation.

The Student Affairs Committee
reviewed the decision of the SCC
and modified its disciplinary action.
Finally the students were allowed to
return to their rooms between mid-
night and eight a.m. The SAC de-
cided that no letters would be sent
home to the parents of the students
involved, and they would still be on
conduct probation.

The final decision
was formed in

of the SAC
response to the

Ma dai

opinions of the — students  ac-
cused, iene to them, the in-
forming of their parents was one of
the very severest penalties that could
have been imposed. The SAC, in an
effort to be flexible, therefore did
not impose this penalty. But what if
a parent called his child during his
month of absence from the dormi-
tory? The possibility of this hap-
pening made it necessary for the
students to be allowed some limited
access to their dormitories, thus the
12-8 stipulation.

In spite of the SAC’s attempt to
be fair, the criticism might be made
that even the penalties doled out are
too severe. After all, the Com-
monwealth of Virginia considers the
possession of marijuana a misde-
meanor thereby placing it in the
same category with possession of
alcohol by minors. Washingon and
Lee does not attempt to keep
alcohol, or drunks, out of the dormi-
tories so why is marijuana viewed
differently.

According to Dean Noell, who sits
on the SAC, the university's policy
toward drugs on campus is the re-
sult of outside influences. In the
first place, parents and society in
general find drinking much more
acceptable than using drugs. The
school must also protect itself from
the interference of city authorities.
Ihe presence of alcohol in the dor-
mitories will probably not result in
a raid by the local authorities but a
drug bust is entirely possible. The
police are less likely to conduct a
bust on campus if they feel the uni-
versity is trying to keep its own
backyard clean.

The university faces a somewhat
different situation concerning the stu-
dents involved in the November
bust. The issue is what action should
the university take now that the

trials have been pushed back to
May and June? Bill Cole, Chairman
of the SCC, feels that no concrete
action will be taken before the trials
unless the cases are simply reviewed
upon demand,

Dean John feels that university
action concerning those indicted
would be a problem if taken before
the trials. He sees the dilemma as
twofold: the university does not
want to prejudge the students’ cases
and obtaining evidence while the
cases are still pending in court would
be difficult. Perhaps the university
could withhold degrees from these
students until their cases were out
of court but Dean John realizes how
unpopular this action would be.

Dean John went on to say that
the flexibility of the university's
position on the drug cases is shown
by the fact that intelligent distinc-
tions can be made in handing out
punishment depending upon the
gravity of the offense. A difference
should be established between a stu-
dent cajoled by an undercover agent
to sell drugs at little or no profit
and the student dealing with exten-
sive traffic.

The attitude taken by Washing-
ton and Lee toward drugs is the re-
sult of a desire to protect its stu-
dent body as much as anything else.
Federal and local authorities are
concerned only with the disciplin-
ary aspect of the problem, not the
counselling aspect. In its decisions
this year the school has shown a re-
sponsiveness to student opinion on
the subject and a desire to deal with
the situation fairly, Those involved
in this year’s on campus drug cases
should be glad that the school is
playing big brother and not shun-
ning its responsibilities to the less
benevolent authorities from the out-
side world.

Letters To The Editor

Another on Coeducation

lo the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

At this writing (Monday noon)
it's not known what result will come
of the student referendum on co-
education at W&L. The comments
that follow bear, then, far less on
today’s vote—however that may go
—than on the merits of the question
itself,

"Not that I mind you dogs running wild all over campus, But, when you
start auditing my class and barking at my lectures, then out you go!”

Your editorial of last week pre-
sented an attempt to review both
sides of the issue, although it failed
to state the opinion of coeducation’s
opponents here that bringing full-
time coeds to the school would ir-
ritate alumni, perhaps diminishing
their generosity hence-forth, and
would eventually produce “alum-
nae” who are proverbially less than
munificent in their own donations
to an alma mater. You then con-
cluded, as a matter of proclama-
tion rather than of argument, that
coeducation “would best serve the
future of W&L as an_ institution.”
Readers must have wondered how
such a judgment was formed.

Worse, though, is the annoying
reflection that proponents of co-
education have never made a sefi-
ous case for their cause. Those of
us who wish to see them lose this
fight can only suspect that faculty
advocates of the change simply wish
to climb on any bandwagon of fad-
dism and “progress” and that stu-
dent supporters of coeducation are
less interested in “humanity” and
“friendship” (as they claim) than in
cutting down on time-consumimeg
road trips.

Assuredly intellectual and scho-
larly considerations can't have cross-
ed the mind of any defender of co-
education, Your own hope that “the
admittance of a few hundred wom-
en. might just give W&L a shot
of vitality it so desperately needs”
will be dispelled by ten minutes of
conversation with a college-age girl,
pick the one you will, The single
claim to distinction which such a
lassie can validly make is that her ig-
norance and sense of infallibility
will usually be greater and her brain
invafiably more addled than those
of even the most frivolous boy radi
cals, (t's one of life’s mysteries that
entertaining old ladies
have been nitwits of

clever and
cun once
twenty!)

In girls’ colleges, nothing much is
at stake; and society can safely leave
them there to their burlesque of
higher edueation, Bringing “stu
dents” of that order to a serious-—to
a male—institution amounts to an
act of sabotage

Murph was once seen in three places
at the same time. He has recovered
stolen bicycles, hidden in closets for
up to 8 hours to track a thief, crack-
ed VMI vandalism cases, and has
the strange habit of appearing at the
scene of an accident before it hap-
pens

“| wouldn't that | have a

Murph. “I just learned what to re-
member. | have learned to stay
awake when most of you are asleep.
I keep no schedule or hours that can

be figured. So don't come looking
for me: just turn around and Tl be

Every W&L student has his favor-

ite Murph story. Some of them are

true, many of them aren't, Murph
just smiles, “Someday TH write a
book about it all and no one will be
lieve a word of it.”

Just where is the line between fact

und fiction to be drawn? It is a fact
that the FBI has record of one
Charles F. Murray cracking several

of their cases? It is a fact that since
Murph's at WAL he has re
covered thousands of dollars of sto-
len property?

One thing is clear: Whether your

Murph has become a legend who
you will remember long after leav

W&L Faculty In The Early 1900's

By J. JASON MATTHEWS

Last week, my silver crucifix came
back from the cleaners and feeling
safe, | descended into the archives
of the library to browse around.
Way in the corner, veiled by eons of
dust and cobwebs, was a crumbling
leather bound volume which kept
me entranced for hours, In fact, I
almost stayed down there after sun-
set, and you know how foolhardy
that is! The faded gold leaf print
was barely visible in the dim light
and | shuddered when I finally de-
ciphered the title . . . “Washington
and Lee Faculty 1897-1933,”
What a gold mine!

| surrepticiously slipped the vol-
ume under my coat, and with little
thought of Robert E. Lee’s honor-
able nature, scurried out the back
door of the Library. | spent a whole
evening going ever that enchanting
tome and have compiled a small list
of the most fascinating faculty mem-
bers. If there is any doubt as to
why we, modern-day DUBYANEL
students bask in the academic uto-
pia of 1972, then look at the price-
less heritage we have acquired from
these venerable pedagogues.,

Astronomy

Dr. Earl B. MacKenzie, 1924-

1931, Dr. McKenzie, a graduate of
the Rocky Mount Institute of the
Stars was on “semi-permanent”

loan from the Rocky Mount Cham-
ber of Commerce. His photograph
shows him to be a large, strong-
browed man with an inner power
emenating from steely, although
crossed eyes. Dr. MacKenzie was
never taken seriously by his stu-
dents as he viewed the heavens us-
ing the tube of a toilet paper roll.
His mysterious disappearance in
1931 was made even more puzzling
by a note in the doctor’s own hand,
left on his bureau saying, “The Mar-
tians have invited me to stay for a
week, so don't wait up.”

Chemistry

Dr. Phillip A. Holland, 1899-
1900. Dr. Holland's unusually short
stay at WAL was due to negligence
on the part of his advanced chemis-
try students. Carelessly leaving a
powerful acid on the floor of Dr.
Holland's office overnight, the stu-
dents were responsible for the rapid
descent of Dr. Holland, his typewri-
ter, and an expensive set of volumes
dealing with oxidation of Phenol in
Saline solution to the basement of

the science building the next morn-
ing. During his short stay however,
Dr .Holland did contribute to the
academic society’s welfare by un-
covering such impurities in the din-
ing hall food as iron filings and fly
ash, He is buried in the foundation
of Howe Hall,

Commerce

Dr. Lawrence T. Filagree, 1924-

1933. Dr, Filagree, a graduate of
Harvard business school came to
W&L with what may be called a

“chip” on his shoulder. Accused of
luring the Harvard Presiednt’s dog
Ruff, into his room to show the be-
wildered creature the uncut version
of “Ecstacy” with Hedy Lamaar, he
had barely enough time to get out
of town before the crowds appeared
in his foyer. Because of this unjust
treatment, Dr. Filagree enjoyed the
somewhat infamous reputation of
being the hardest “A” in the school.
A quiet and simple man, the good
doctor lived outside of Lexington,
his spacious two-story home over-
looking the scenic pastures of the
Shenandoah Valley.

English

Dr. Ernest P. Snaders, 1898-1927,
Dr. Snaders was without a doubt
the most popular and well-respected
professor on campus, The 1924 and
1926 yearbooks were dedicated to
him, and there wasn't a minute of
the day that Dr. Snaders wasn’t sur-
rounded by adoring students asking
questions or for advice in all sorts
of matters.

His pictures (the early ones), por-
tray him as a jovial and smiling
man, his twinkling eyes even now,
instilling us with a great warmth.
However, in 1927, his last year at
WA&L, something seems to have
happened. That year records noth-
ing special save for Dr. Snader’s
revision of the Honor Pledge, (mak-
ing it airtight and impossible to get
around).

But the year was marred by in-
credible near-accidents like payroll
teelering off buildings, nar-
missing Dr. Snaders, and the
demolishing of his brand-new
Model-T by explosion two minutes
before Dr. Snaders was to drive it
to the campus. He left Lexington
after the third fire burned his home,

By WARREN DAVIS

The prevailing attitude concern-
ing the °72-73 Generals basketball
season was definitely optimistic.
With four returning starters and a
talented crop of freshmen and sop-
homores, all indications pointed to-
ward a promising season, The opti-
mism soon faded, however, with the
Generals hovering around the 500
mark all season and, except in a few
games, failing to realize their poten-
tial. Senior Charlie Strain talked
with us about some of the seasons
for the disappointing year and of-
fered some opinions about the bas-
ketball program in general. Charlie,
a 61” guard, hails from Garden
City, New York, and has earned
three varsity letters at Washington
and Lee.

Oharlie offered a number of fac-
tors contributing to the team’s de-
mise, such as “inexperience after the
first four, since the rest of the team
was made up mostly of freshmen
and sophomores. Losing Norm
(Kristoff) definitely hurt, since we
lost needed board strength, plus the
fact that Paul (McClure) didn’t get
the chance to rest as much during
the games. We didn’t run as much
as we might have, although we had
ihe material to run and a lot of
times we didn’t put enough pressure
on the other team. Many times we
played the other team’s game in-
stead of playing the type of ball
which we were capable of playing.”
\ big problem that few people
think of is the three week layoff for
Christmas vacation. “It’s hard to
stay in shape for three weeks on
your own. You're bound to lose
something when you come back in
January, Overall, too, the quality of

competition was a little better this
year.”

One of the interesting things
Charlie pointed out was that there
might have been “a little too much
organization.” This may have taken
some of the fun out of the game.
“In New York, it’s a completely dif-
ferent style of ball. A lot of people
think of New York playground ball
as strictly one on one, but it’s really
not at all. It's more two on two and
three on three, with a lot of pick
and rolls, a lot of shooting off
screens, a lot of just taking advan-
tage of the situation. In New York,
the basketball is more creative and
the players rely much more on in-
stinct. Here, it’s pattern ball and
there’s not as much room for free
lancing. In a way it is inhibiting,
which results in a lack of confidence.
rhis year we didn't have the clutch
euy like Mike Daniel to go to in
tight situations, A lot of the play-
ers weren't confident to ‘make their
move’ which may come with more
experience. By playing pattern bas-
ketball each shot takes on more im-
portance. When you're running you
tend to be loose and it’s not as im-
portant if you miss a 15-footer off
a fast break because you usually
have guys crashing the boards.”

When asked if he did anything dif-
ferently this year, Charlie replied, “I
kept my mouth shut, | tried to do
the best | could when | got in a
game and tried to show leadership
from the bench—if that’s possible.”
As some will remember, Charlie
started the first eight games and
was then benched as Verne Canfield
tried different guard combinations to
try and get the team going. ¢ harlie

Netters Prepa re
For Big Spring

By PAUL SIMPSON

In a rare, exclusive interview with
Warren Davis, The Ring-tum Phi,
in a rare display of journalistic ag-
gressiveness, has gained invaluable
information concerning the condi-
tion of the 1973 Washington and
Lee tennis team.

Dr. Davis, who, after many re-
quests finally relented and allowed
his first exclusive interview to a
member of the Phi sport's staff, ex-
pressed his optimism for the com-

ing season in just a few concise
words, “I think we have good
depth,”

And how important “good depth”
is. With each separate tennis meet

consisting of six single and three
double matches, the sixth man

counts just as much as the first,
Losing only one man from last
year’s squad (Captain Jeff Driscoll),
the Generals of the courts appear
to be in a good position to retain

Diamond Nine Looking Real Fine;
Open Season This Saturday Here

By TOM RAMEY

Baseball at Washington and Lee
has for some time been a subject
valued only in the eyes of the be-
holders. For quite a while, the pro-
gram has been neglected, given only
a minimal budget, and taken for
granted. In response to this, W&L
baseball teams of late have been
rather sporadic, But such was not
the case last year as the ‘72 Gen-
erals, coming off a 5-20 record the
year before, had an NCAA Region
Three Playoff berth within their
grasp only to be snatched away al
the last moment by Old Dominion.

The 1973 rendition of Washing-
ton and Lee baseball opens this Sat-
urday to what Coach Joe Lyles op-
timistically predicts “could and
very likely will be the best baseball
team Washington and Lee has had
in the fourteen years that | have
been here.” There are perhaps sev-
ral reasons with which Coach Lyles
can justify his predictions. First of
all, being defending CAC champs,
the nucleus for a championship
team already exists. Despite blows
from graduation, seven lettermen
return to offer the experience and
leadership necessary for a winning
season.

Secondly, Lyles is “ex-
tremely pleased” with the ability
shown so far by the incoming fresh-
mon and by a trio of sophomores
who are out for the first time. lt is
this group that must be relied on if
the year is to be a successful one.
Thirdly, concerns this year’s co-cap-
tains: “Credit is due where credit is
deserved,” Coach Lyles commented
referring to Co-Captains Ellie Gut-
shall and Doug Clelan, Both have
already taken the initative by ex
h biting leadership and responsibil
ity, and other intangibles which are
essential to a sucessful year.

Coach

The team itself looks rather solid
throughout. That all important pitch-
ing staff is anchored down by hard
throwing sophomore “Hod Rod”
Ferrandino, who wound up last year
with a nifty 3.72 E.R.A. Expected
to bolster both the starting rotation
and the bullpen are lefty Haller
Jackson, co-captain Ellie Gutshall,
and freshmen Tom Hudgins and
Matt Basile. Yet the surprise of the
season so far has been sophomore
Jeff Knauer, who Lyles says is the
“quickest thrower on the staff.”

The infield looks good, but the
performance of several freshmen is
critical. Going ‘around the horn’—at
third is sophomore Alan Burton,
who at the present is sharing duty
there with pitcher-third sacker Jeff
Knauer. At second base, the Blue
have reliable Denny Hathaway, who
last year hit at a hot .341 chip.
Backing up Don are defensive mind-
ed Bill Sigler and Gerald Costello.

Shortstop finds “Mr. Dependable”
Doug Clelan. Clelan is in tremend-
ous shape due to basketball and is
playing “better than ever.” Digging
into first base one finds a gold mine
of talent. The position is currently
held by freshman John Rice, who
definitely has, according to Lyles,

good pro-ability.” Close on John's
heels at first is another freshman,
Henry Sempole.

The outfield appears to be tied
down by proven performers, One
slot is held by the long ball hitting
Dave Taylor. Another will be held
by Ellie Gutshall, who led the team
last year with a torrid 403 aver-
age. Gerald “Chip” Costello will fill
the third slot. Help is expected to
come from freshman Doug Paul and
Al Radcliff, and sophomore Ray
Rheault,

The schedule for the year looks
tough, but Coach Lyles is quick to

Stickmen Slide By Morgan State

W&L’s lacrosse team used a third
quarter scoring spree to get by
Morgan State 17-10 last Saturday,
then came on strong to whip Notre
Dame 17-5 in an exhibition match
on Monday.

Early in Saturday’s game, Morgan
State appeared to be a_ pushover.
Before the game was three minutes
old, W&L had a 3-0 lead on goals
by Ed Tognetti, Brian Chasney and
John Lalley. With the exception of
Wayne Jackson’s lone goal, Mor-
gan State did nothing in the first
quarter and trailed 4-1 after Ted
Bauer scored.

The second quarter was a different
story. Dave Warfield got a goal early
in the period, but Morgan State’s
Jackson scored unassisted to make
the score 5-2. The Generals’ of-
fense got sloppy, and rare accurate
pass by Morgan's goalie resulted in
an easy goal on a fast break. Rich
Romanelli answered that goal, but
Morgan got three more that period
to tie it up, 6-6. With 21 seconds
to go, Brian Chasney gave the Blue
a one-point lead, 7-6,

Morgan opened the third period
by scoring in 45 seconds, but it
was their last goal for a long time.
Sam Englehart started the Gen-
erals’ scoring with 13:46 left in the
period. Brian Chasney added his
third goal, but the Generals were in-
consistent, missing several chances
to score on fast breaks. The Blue
also had trouble getting their feed
passes inside. Englehart scored un-
assisted, and Chasney threw in his
fourth with 1:42 left in the quarter.
As ihe period ended, W&L played
more settled lacrosse and Skip Licht-
fuss chalked up his first goal with
only 38 seconds left, giving WAI
a 12-7 lead.

The fourth quarter scoring picked
up, with Ted Bauer drawing first
blood with Defenseman Don Eaven-
son livened up the crowd by going
the length of the field and scoring
unassisted, That would have blown
the game open, but Morgan State
scored on a weak shot to keep its
hopes alive,

As the period wore on, the Gen-
crals blew several chances on fast
breaks, consistently pulling up at
the restraining line or holding the
ball too long after a feed pass. With
8:10 left, Morgan State scored, nar-
rowing the margin 14-9, Freshman
Malcolm Hastings replaced Skeeter
Chadwick in the crease, but he saw
little action as the Generals offense

picked. up. The pressure on the
Morgan goal was bound to result in
goals, and it did, by Englehart and
Ken Miller. Jackson scored again
for Morgan State but the game was
out of reach. Ken Daniels finished
the scoring late in the game to give
WAL its biggest lead, 17-10.

As a team, Morgan State played
poorly, Of its ten goals, only one
was assisted, Most of its goals came
on face-offs or ground balls, with
one player getting an open shot un-
challenged. W&L goalies did not
perform well, but they got little sup-
port on fast breaks.

Against Notre Dame, W&L play-
ed better defense in an elaborate
“scrimmage”. The Irish played in-
spired, if incompetent, lacrosse.
Brian Chasney got an unassisted
goal with only 4:11 left in the first
period. Notre Dame controlled the

 

 

early part of the period but could
not score. W&L dominated the last
minutes, with the Notre Dame goal-
ie dropping a save into his goal for
the second General tally, Notre
Dame scored once in the first quar-
ter, their only score of the half.

[he roof fell in on the Irish in the
second quarter, as the Generals scor-
ed seven goals. Bob Brumback and
Don Carroll both scored twice, with
Lichtfuss, Lalley and Englehart each
adding one apiece. The Generals
took a 9-1 lead into the dressing
room,

Carroll and Englehart dominated
the third quarter, with Don feeding
Sam from behind the crease for
three goals. Carroll also passed to
Jim Steiff for a goal, and Chasney
helped Englehart to his fourth goal
of the quarter.

Notre Dame managed one goal in

the third period coming, as usual, on
a fast break following a face-off,

Bob Brumback’s third goal late
in the final period gave the Gen-
erals a 15-2 lead, The scoring pace
slowed as the Generals substituted
heavily. Ted Bauer threw one that
the Notre Dame goalie never even
saw, but the Irish finally managed
to score again while W&L was a
man short following a penalty. John
Aaron scored the Generals’ seven-
teenth and final goal, but the Fight-
ing Irish got a couple of cheapies in
the last minute, the final one coming
when Bill Hoatson left the crease to
help scrap for a loose ball. Final
score: 17-5,

[he Generals played a whole lot
better against Notre Dame than they
did against Morgan State, but next
weekend they travel to play the Mt.

These three young men just made the

discovery of a lifetime. The oldest is 34.

Remember when young people could get ahead in busi-
ness simply by growing old? It was a good system for
those with a little talent and a lot of patience, but today’s
technology moves too fast to wait for seniority.

At Kodak, our extensive involvement in basic research
has made the need for fresh, young thinking more press-
ing than ever. So we hire the best new talent we possibly
ean. Then we do both of us a favor by turning them loose
on real problems, and giving them the freedom and re-

sponsibility they need to solve them.

That's how three Kodak scientists in their early thir-
ties just made a breakthrough in liquid lasers, develop-
ing an organic dye laser with a continuous beam. Their

 

discovery means more than just a new kind of laser. It
means a whole range of new laser applications, in fields
from medicine to communications.

It was the kind of discovery most men and women
work a lifetime for. Yet these young men still have most
of their lifetimes ahead of them.

Why de we give young men and women so much free-
dom and responsibility? Because it’s good business, and
we're in business to make a profit. But in furthering our

own business interests, we also further society's inter-

ests. And that’s good
After all, our business depends on society. So we care

whether or not these students are to
be reimbursed a proportion of their
investment corresponding to con-
certs mot received. By our legal
standards, they are entitled to such
a reimbursement; the Dance Board
is blatantly guilty of breach of
contract,

Phe important point, however, is
that legal means should not be nec-
essary. We talk a lot about indivi-
dual honor at Washington and Lee.
Well, what about the honor of our
elected student officers? Frankly, the
students who bought Dance Board
Plan Cards are getting screwed be-
cause they put faith in these officers.

If the Dance Board does not have
the necessary funds, then the Exe-
cutive Committee should step in, It
is with the EC that final responsibil-
ity to right this wrong lies. I can
only hope that the students we have
chosen to sit in judgment of other
students honor recognize this re-
sponsibility, both to their office and
to themselves.

Also, I am just as hopeful that
this lesson will prompt a more seri-
ous reflection before promises are
made to WA&L students in the future.

improving on successful 13-7 rec-

ord,

Coach Tom Davies has an able
group to choose his top six from
with returning lettermen Marshall
Washburn (this year’s Captain), San-
dy Lawrence, John Embree, Tim
Thompson, Stan Taylor, and of
course, Warren Davis,

Pressing hard on the heels of the
upperclassmen are freshmen Will
Palfrey and Don Caffery. Because of
the surplus of talent, a J.V. team
will be formed this season for the
first time.

With little change in last year’s
schedule, the Generals toughest op-
ponents appear to be U.Va, Har-
vard and the University of South
Carolina. The squad will be com-
peting in the VCAA championships
for the first time this year.

The season will get into full
swing during the spring break, when
WAL. will hit the road on a trip to

Florida. On the way, a stop at the
U. of S. Carolina will be made all
the more difficult since the Harvard
tennis team also plans to attend.

was not critical of the coach’s de-
cision, suggesting only that “when
things are going bad a coach will
tend to start playing personalities,”
However, “unless a person is sure of
his position he’s not going to play
up to his capabilities.”

Why did Charlie come to W & L’?
After attending the University of
South Carolina for a year, he wish-
ed for something “smaller, and
somewhere I could play ball, | hurt
my knee in high school but Coach
Canfield still showed interest, so
largely because of ‘him I decided to
come here. This seemed like an ideal
place to play, since there’s no pres-
sure because there’s no scholarships
and there’s virtually no pressure from
the fans. When winning becomes the
only end, organized sports is a little
disillusioning.”

What about next year’s team?
“There's definitely a lot of talent,
Norm Kristoff is capable of domi-
nating games with his size and
strength. Gary Fitzgerald has as
much natural ability as anyone whos
ever played for W & L — including
guys like ‘Magic Mel’ and Mike
Neer. Another freshmen, John Pod-
gajny, also shows a lot of ability
and can hit from the outside. He's
got a lot of fire and plays like a city
ballplayer. Those guys should be in-
teresting to watch for the next few
years.”

W&L’s Faculty?

frail man was nevertheless a tower-
ing intellect on the W&L campus.
During his stay in Lexington he
published several books, wrote many
papers and in general, established
himself as a pioneer in his field.
However, in the last years his con-
dition weakened him both physically
and mentally. The quality and gen-
ius of his work was drastically di-
minished. He resigned shortly after
running out of the shower room
holding a cardboard crown scream-
ing “Eureka, Eureka!” His paper on
increasing the mechanical advan-
tage of Catherine the Great's block
and tackle system was never made
public.

With this rather somber conclu-
sion the list of extraordinary faculty
members comes to a close. As all
the great intellects have said at least
once in their lives, “To understand
fully the complexities and wonders
of our age, we must first understand
the soil from whence they camest!”

Let us thank these hardy men
who through their sweat and blood
made this a better school to learn in
and a better world to raise our chil-
dren in, if we have any.

Will Wife-Swapping
Better Their Curve?

By BILL AUSTIN

The splendid green-season sport
will never be the same again, for its
titans, its bigger-than-life perform-
ers of bat, ball and glove, have slip-
ped into the mire that encompasses
the rest of us,

Last week, when proud baseball's
fortunes seemed to rise with an
ending to the yearly parade of Mar-
vin Miller—led grievances, a pair
of pin-striped jokers disrupted the
sun-shine beauty of spring training
with their bizarre confessions,

Golden-armed Fritz Peterson, last
year’s 17-game winner on the im-
posing mound corps of the New
York Yankees, disclosed the mind-
harrowing details. He and best pal
Mike Kekich, another pitcher of
less breath-taking statistics, had in-
dulged in a wife- swapping of un-
usual permanency. The trade not
only included willing spouses, but
bubbling offspring (save the eldest of
each brood), and alas, even family
pets. The fun began last summer
when the two couples viewed a
rather provocative movie, stimulat-
ing their previously caged desires
for a closer knitting of the group's
companionship. A lot of nervous
joking and laughter accompanied
the subject, but evidently its lure
was not lost on the lusty Kekich.
He soon approached the unflappable
Peterson with his scorching passion
for Mrs. P., and Jim Bouton’s for-
merally in oddity readily agreed to
a consummation o fthe surging emo-
tion.

With a pennant race's heatedness
providing the romantic back-drop,
Fritz bestowed his wife to friend
Mike, and in turn received the ac-
quiescent Sussanne K. The deal
grew to include an exchange of
home addresses, and ultimately, at
seaosn’s conclusion, a full-time ac-
cordance was reached.

The situation appeared to inspire
universal bliss until winter's chill
found Mr. Kekich and Mrs, Peter-
son “bumping heads” stubbornly
over domestic matters. Meanwhile,
frolicsome Fritz and Mrs. Kekich
enjoyed a relationship of divine har-
mony, finding a happiness never be-

fore experienced in love, family, ex-
istence,

When Kekich asked for a reture
to the normalcy of the pre-trade ar-
rangement, Peterson balked, assert-
ing that nothing, even friendship,
could undermine ‘his love's lasting-
ness. Mrs. Fritz left the losing hur-
ler (Kekich), finding solace in the
arms of shocked parents, while the
abandoned one maintained a surly,
hate-filled silence. As he admitted
begrudgingly to the reporter-mobs
who examined him ceaselessly, “our
friendship’s over . . . I'm left with
nothing.”

At present, Fritz and Sue con-
tinue to coo in the ecstasy of the
achieved union, They deny any taint
of smuttiness in the entire affair, and
report that fan mail is in their favor,
The masses approve,

Unfairly, the melodrama has over-
shadowed the bright prospects tout-
ed by this year’s Yankees, an outfit
strengthened by the acquisitions of
powerful Craig Nettles and spray-
hitting Matty Alou. In fact, one
competent Las Vegas sage has in-
stalled the legend-coated team as a
9-5 favorite in 1973's AL East.

As expected, baseball trade rumors
flourished when Peterson admitted
to his domestic reorderings, as a
fearful management sought to pre-
vent the spreading of the ex-friends’
animosity into the morale of the rest
of the club. Ralph Houk, fiesty
field boss of the Yanks and surely no
liberated soul, would only concede
that personal lives did not necessar-
ily affect field effectiveness. Others
judged more sternly. Lindy MceDan-
iel, a lay minister of great devotion,
cast a mournful gaze up the activi-
ties of the playful teammates. “It’s
not very pretty, is it?”

Now, at the outset of a campaign
of potential, news-reapers flock to
the smirking Peterson or the sullen
Kekich rather than to the team’s
exhibition performances. As the
much-abused Kekich blurbed this
past weekend after working a cou-
ple of shaky innings: “Why don't
you guys go up and watch the rest
of the game? You might miss some-
thing”.

Kane, Inc., To Build Lewis Hall

Law Contract Is Awarded

By JESS REEVES

Washington and Lee's expansion
program is slowly moving along as
a general contractor has been award-
ed the $6,683,998 contract for the
new law school and cooling plant.
Plans for student housing, a new
unedrgraduate library, grounds im-
provements, and additional tennis
courts are still on the drawing board.

George W. Kane, Inc. has been
named as the general contractor for
the Lewis Hall project, being the
lowest bidder of the seven firms that
sent in bids. Kane's original bid
was approximately $6,840,000,
somewhat over the $6,400,000 pro-
jected budget for the building. Al-
lernatives were investigated to re-
duce the building costs, and the fig
ure was lowered to its present level.

After a set of plans was accepted
for Lewis Hall, the University's ar-

chitectural firm compiled a list of
thirty general contractors that would
be suitable for the job. These com-
panies were contacted and eight
eventually expressed interest in the
contract, but one of these firms
dropped out at the last minute. Two
of the bids received were less than
$7,000,000, three were in the $7,-
000,000 to $8,000,000 range, and
iwo were above $8,000,000.

The preparation of the site is
now behind schedule due to unfav-
orable weather conditions. A meet-
ing this week between the rough site
contractor and Kane's representa-
tive will determine when this month
the general contractor will take
over the site. Construction will sup-
posedly be completed by September,

The total cost of the law school
and cooling plant is expected to be
about $8,600,000. This figure in-

cludes building, architectural and
engineering fees, and the furnishing
of the new structure (which should
require approximately a million it-
elf).

Married Student Housing

HUD funding for the married
student housing has been approved
but several changes had to be made
in the plans, owing to HUD regula-
tions. By the time HUD and the
University came to an agreement
on the plans eighteen months had
elapsed and building costs were still
rising. The recent bids were 49%
higher than expected, so all advant-
ige that could have been gained by
working with HUD was lost. It was
hoped that HUD’s aid would allow
the University to offer housing at a
lower rent than would have other-
wise been possible.

At present the possibility of fi-

| Elections Are Monday
For Class & EC Offices

No fewer than 43 candidates will
be battling for 15 class and Execu-
tive Committee positions in Mon-
day’s elections.

Any runoff elections will be held
the following Tuesday. Normally
runoffs are held on Thursday follow
ing the elections but exams will be
underway on that day. Wednesday
js a reading day, and the EC doubt-
ed if any students would be on
campus that day, besides those stu-

dents living in the dorms,

In last week's runoff elections for
EC posits, second year law siudent
Doug Schwartz defeated Lewis

Powell for student body president
by just 23 votes, 660 to 627, with
77 percent of the student body vot-
ing.

nancing the project through tax ex-
empt Virginia College Building Au-
thority bonds is being investigated.
As another alternative, both mar-
and undergraduate
housing might be contracted as one
money. At any rate,
relief for married students is im sight
as either the school or private in-
vestors will provide additional hous-
ing to replace Hillside Terrace.

lOUTLOOK and REVIEW
On the Election...

Our congratulations go to Doug Schwartz for his election
victory last week; we wish him a most successful tenure as
next year’s Student Body chieftan, While we did not agree
with every point on his platform, Mr. Schwartz cannot be
faulted for the sheer drive and enthusiam of his campaign.

And remarkably enough, some of Mr. Schwartz's energy
rubbed off on the students. With 77 per cent voting in the
Thursday run-off, W&L hit a high for recent years in student
election participation. Not since the 96 plus per cent voted
in the “end classes” referendum during the Cambodia-Kent
State uproar has so much excitement been engendered by a
campus vote. But, lest we forget, that much touted student
“concern” of the spring of 1970 quickly evaporated over the
summer, and W&L drifted back into its familiar state of som-
nolence. It will be Mr. Schwartz's biggest challenge to pre-
vent that from happening now, to channel some of his elec-
tion momentum into greater post-election student involve-
iment.

Of course, such fervent campaigns have their unsavory
sides as well; for if this was one of the most exuberant races
of recent memory, it was also one of the most bitter. By
Wednesday night all sorts of ridiculous rumors, charges, and
counter-charges were flying around—about torn posters,
filched flyers, stolen ice-cream cups... you name it. It was
to the credit of both Mr. Schwartz and Mr, Powell that they
came together on election eve, shook hands, and promised to
cooperate in toning down some of the campaign excesses of
both sides.

We trust a similar maturity will characterize the whole EC
throughout the upcoming year. If so, it should be a very good

year indeed.
... and the Coed Vote

The margin of the pro-coeducation vote in last week's re-
ferendum frankly surprised even us, Though we amateur jour-
nalists make no claim to be the most astute sensors of the
campus mood, we knew the vote would be more favorable to
coeducation than last year’s. As it turned out, what we got
was almost a complete reversal.

And more than one disgruntled all-male advocate has al-
ready expained away the flip-flop; they suggest that members
of the law school couldn't vote last year, and their ballots
swayed the poll in favor of coeducation.

Well, this is simply not the case. In fact, the law school
did participate in last year’s referendum, and, anyway, there
is no evidence that they voted in a bloc on the issue.

We certainly don’t expect the Powers That Be to jump in
immediate compliance with the results. But the fact that 59
per cent of the student body disapproves of W&L’s all-male
status cannot be ignored—by students, faculty, administrators,
or trustees.

Another referendum must be taken next year; if the re-
sults are similar, then planning for a coed Washington and
Lee should shift into high gear.

A “Big Mistake”

Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath after
the three cultural programs were run off in succession earlier
this term, we offer our congratulations to those people re-
sponsible for the three programs, particularly those respon-
sible for Contact '73. All three programs were outstanding,
but the effect of each presentation was dampened by the
scheduling of the programs.

In 20 days, Black Culture Week, Contact, and the Glas-
vow Endowment Program brought no less than 15 speakers or
cultural events to the Washington and Lee campus,

Somebody made a big mistake.

The purpose of each program—to enrich the culture of this
campus community—was defeated by the scheduling. At best,
most persons only got a sampling of each program's offerings.

Instead of each program being a highlight of the academic
vear, the three bunched together, were almost a headache, with
classes, mid-terms, and papers all crushing upon us,

One program in the Fall Term, one in the Winter Term,
and one in the Suring Term would be ideal, but even two in
one term several weeks apart would be quite tolerable,

We suggest that the forces behind Black Culture Week,
Contact, and the Glasgow Program meet sometime early next
vear to work out some type of scheduling outline for their
programs. Each program could have several time slots with
which to work, and thus would not be hampered by being
limited to, say, a two-week period,

With some sort of coordinating effort, each program would
be a highlight next year, and another “big mistake” would be

Into The W&L Grading

By J. JASON MATTHEWS

I got very angry today over a
silly argument about whether teach-
ers grade the papers that fall to the
bottom of the stairs higher than the
ones that remain relatively close to
the top, near the landing. | argued
for a solid hour with my best friend
and | know that we both left in a
huff. | decided to ask a close friend
of mine who happens to be on the
faculty what exactly is the grading
system here. Ascending the stairs to
his office, I arrived at his door
which had a typewritten card in-
structing the visitor to ‘enter without
knocking”. | did so and found the
professor throwing darts at a five
foot poster of Mamie Van Doren
who was, I may add, clad insuffi-
ciently for an Arctic tour, (or any
tour save perhaps for a two-week
vacation in the rain forest of Nioar-
agua). He hadn't seen me so I
quickly ducked back and shut the
door. Knocking once, very softly, |
waited, There was a high-pitched
voice exclaiming, “One moment
please,” and a scraping of a chair,
and then, “Come in.” The office
was unchanged save for the appear-
ance of a Constable water color,
The poster had disappeared.

| explained my problem to the
professor and he smiled faintly as
he leaned back and lit a cigarette,
filter end to the match, He was
struggling not to show his discom-
fort but the slight mauve coloring
around his ears gave him away. “Let
me let you in on a secret,” he whis-
pered leaning close to me, catching
his tie in the desk drawer and pull-
ing the knot Gordian-tight, “Some
professors don't even read some
papers!" He was gasping for air
wnd had to sit back and loosen his
cravat,

“You mean... .” | stammered,

He smiled and leaned back again
catching himself just as the chair
was going to go over backwards and
fling him out the window,

| thanked him and left his office
with a new concept whirring in my
mind. Did some teachers put their
private lives before the education of
the young minds in their classrooms?
What could they have to do other
than correct papers and prepare for
class the next day? I resolved to in-
vestigate this further with my best
friend and find out the real truth.

Our next step to capture the cri-
minal professor was very ingenious
although risky, My friend and |
hog-tied some Girl Scouts, bor-
rowing their uniforms and the sev-
eral boxes of cookies they had on
them. Disguising ourselves then, as
Gitl Scouts, we would visit each

professor's house and try to see if
any stairways in their homes were
marked in any way. That is, if we
saw on entering, the top three stairs
marked “D” with paint or tape, and
the rest “C” “B” and “A” in des-
cending order we would know for
sure. Besides being very embarrass-
ed when the pick-up filled with tow-
nies stopped us on the road be-
ween houses the whole plan failed
miserably. We were stymied.

On Campaign Tactics

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

The recent student body elec-
tions and the coeducation referen-
dum have brought to light some-
thing that does not augur well for
this university. | am referring to the
actions of certain individuals and
groups of individuals who apparent-
ly felt that freedom of speech was
intended only for those who agree
with them. The destruction of pos-
ters is not new here, but never be-
fore has it been so widespread, and
never before have the victims of this
tactic been so specific.

Those of us who opposed coedu-
cation and supported Lewis Powell
were forced to accept the fact that
most of the posters we put up would
“disappear” overnight, some within
a few minutes, I personally observ-
ed three students, all undoubtedly in
favor of free speech, methodically
strip the campus of every anti-coedu-
cation poster they could find. | also
helped make posters for Lewis
Powell's runoff bid, and saw only a
handful of them up 12 hours later,
on the election day,

| recall being told that a univer-
sity is a marketplace for ideas, a
place where anyone could say any-
thing he liked, without fear of be-
ing prevented from saying it again
Apparently this is no longer the
case at WAL. The fascist pigs are
here in force, and their brown-shirt
tactics have probably helped them

“Don't worry my boy, it’s not
that important. Believe me.” He
shook his pen for added emphasis
and flicked some ink on his cheek.
He continued talking to me, not
realizing what he had done. After
a few more minutes I rose to leave.
He got up to shake my hand but
but banged his shin against the chair
and had to sit down again real fast.
| said goodbye and walked out, As
| was going down the stairs, deep
in thought, | noticed something.
The paint on the side of the stair-
way was wet, it glistened in the
light. | took out my handkerchief
and wiped away the excess, The let-
ter “C” stood out plain as day. My
mind wheeled, You mean, a whole
department!?

“Yes, a whole department,” a
voice sneered, “Now come this way.”
My friend the teacher was standing

Now, | don't claim that there was
au “conspiracy” or that these tot-
alitarian actions were an accessory
to the game plans of those who ul-
timately derived benefit from them.
| am sure Doug Schwartz had the
good sense not to know that his op-
ponent's posters were being destroy-
ed. But if there was no planning in-
volved, there was still a good deal
more to this than haphazardness,
and Mr. Schwartz's narrow victory
is immeasurably cheapened by it.

| must also question the validity
of the margin of victory for coedu-
cation. | think the results might
have been different, at least given
an equal opportunity to express their
viewpomis,

This brings me to the question I
must now pose: Do we, as mem-
bers of a free society and partici-
pants in the exchange of ideas, tol-
erate this assault on our rights, or
do we repudiate these tactics and
the individuals using them? If we
do not, |, for one, would be asham-
ed to be a member of this com-
munity any longer,

Harriers Open
Hopeful Year

By KEN RUSCIO

Washington and Lee’s track team,
supported by a strong background
of indoor track, moves outdoors this
week with the hopes of continuing
their success, Coach Norris Aldridge
will be relying heavily on a strong
squad of sprinters and quarter-mil-
ers as well as the field events to cap-
ture the CAC, VCAA, and several
important dual meets including
Hampden-Sydney and Bridgewater.

Brandon Herbert, co-captain, will
lead the 440 men. In excellent con-
dition following a successful indoor
season he will be backed up by
Dave Lawson, Harry Smith, and
Willic-Bob Wingfield. Dave Estes al-
though moved to the 880 will also
probably run an occasional one-
lapper, Estes is now training for the
880 in an effort to boost an injury-
riddled distance squad. Tom Bau-
mann, freshman 880 runner, and 3-
miler Mike Burns have been treat-
ing injuries for several weeks with
little result. Bob Sherwood, miler
and co-captain, has recently been
added to the list. Stu Nibley injur-
ed since cross-country appears out
for the season. The weight will
therefore fall on Bill Kalal, Jim
McMenemin, Tem Washington, and
Rich Vieser.

Paul Suthern, hurdler, is looking
forward to still more honors to add
to his indoor collection, One of the
tops in the state, he is also a VCAA
and CAC contender. Phifer Helm;
and John Newmann should also
contend for the conference honors,

In the field events Barclay Arm-
strong (long jump and triple jump)
and Paul Hartmann (pole vault) will
be called on for valuable points as
will Mark George and Frank Por-
ter in the high jump. Shotputters
Phil Jones and Bob Fallis will also
contribute to the team effort.

The Generals open their season
against Shepherd on Tuesday and
Madison on Thursday, These early
meets should unite the team for the
spring campaign which includes the
VCAA championship on April 21
and the CAC championship on May
11 and 12.

THE

House Di
To Soviets, 146-141

By KEN RUSCIO

“It's not who wins and loses.
Competition is the thing,” dechared
ler-Ovanesyan, coach of the USSR
track them as he calmly plotted the
defeat of the Americans. He con-
tinued seriously, “We—my country,
your country—should put out our
best athletes. That is the best thing.”
He then sat back and stifled a yawn
which was really a clever facade
disguising his laughter at those silly
Americans, One can imagine what
was on his mind as well as cvery
other member of the Russian team
as they witnessed yet another chap-
ter of the NCAA-AAU squabble.
They were undoubtably overjoyed as
the NCAA threat of suspension fore-
ed several athletes out of the com-
petition allowing the Russians a
narrow 146-141 win,

In a week during which the NCAA
should have been worrying more
about their basketball tournament
they turned instead to track. The
USSR-USA track meet, held in
Richmond last Friday and Satur-
day is controlled by the AAU, the
governing body for amateur athletes
in the United States. To qualify for
the meet the runners and field event
men had to have excelled at the na-
tional AAU championships held in
New York two weeks prior to the
international meet. In the national
championships several top cvilege
performers qualified to compete
against Russia and no doubt eagerly
awaited the chance. At this point
the NCAA officials cleared their
throats, unrolled their scroll, shook
their heads, and decreed flatly,
“No.” The AAU had refused to beg
for NCAA sanction and therefore
any college athletes who participat-
ed in the meet would be subject to
severe penalities along with their
school. Well anyone with common
sense would expect the AAU to say
hell yeah, and go right ahead and
request certification, a simple, inane
procedure. But anyone acquainied
with the past history of the feud
knows that common sense has noth-
ing whatsoever to do with amateur
athletics in the United States. So the
AAU official ascended his podium,
declared that since this meet was in-
ternational it required no certifica-
tion and besides, after all, it was a
“matter of principle.” With that he
put his thumb to his nose, flicked
his tongue out, turned around, and
stomped away.

The college athletes found them-
selves in a predicament. It was not
so much prohibitions against them-
selves that presented the problem
but it was difficult for them to com-
pete when the entire institution they
belonged to could be inflicted with
penalties, Fred Samara of the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania and Dennis

Walker of Adelphi along with their
athletic departments chose to defy
the NCAA. The outcome of their re-
bellion won't be known until a final
court hearing is held Tuesday, For
his pains, Samara was the only last
place finisher to receive a standing
ovation. Dennis Walker, competing
in the men’s medley relay which
beat the Russians when Valeri Bor-
zov pulled up lame, likewise receiv-
ed one. But Rod Milburn, the great-
est hurdler in the world as well as
five other world class athletes and
the US coach acquiesced and with-
drew from the meet, Their presence
would assuredly have reversed the
5 point margin of defeat for the
men’s team.

Appropriately enough, the star at
Richmond was a child, a 14 year
old, eighth grader from Washing-
ton, D.C. who won the women’s
880 and anchored the medley relay
which insured a victory for the U.S.
women's team. Robin Campbell's
youthful innocence became an ironic
symbol of purity in an affair mark-
ed by over-bureaucratization and
disregard of the values of amateur
athletics. She too received a stand-
ing ovation.

Otherwise the meet, compared to
some of the New York and Los
Angeles spectacles, was not notable.
In some areas the Americans lost
where they should have won (the
hurdles and three mile, with Tracy
Smith recovering from the flu) and
won where they should have lost
(George Grenn's defeat of Olympic
gold medalist Bonarchuk in the
hammer). Other events went as ex-
pected with the Americans captur-
ing the 600 yard run and the 60
yard dash and the Russians winning
the 1000 yard run, the mile, and
the pentathlon.

Nevertheless the meet has enorm-
ous potential. Freed from the grips
of bureaucratic monstrosities which
still have rules requiring shorts to
no more than two inches above the
knee and restricting the value of
awards to less than the price of a
cheap trophy, the affair may realize
the vision imitially hoped for.
Amateur athletics is at the cross-
roads, With the tragedy of the
Olympics still arousing debate and
the NCAA-AAU war reaching a
boiling point something must be
done in the near future. Common
sense, that elusive quality which
somehow manages to eternally by-
pass the two organizations, would
dictate the turning over of the whole
mess to the athletes themselves, Two
outmoded organizations clinging to
archaic notions of amateurism is, at
best, an anachronism, Perhaps with
this most recent fiasco a freason-
able alternative can be constructed,

W&L Stickmen Split Two;
Battle Cornell On Friday

WAL’s lacrosse team split a pair
of scrimmages this week, losing to
Mt. Washington 11-7 and crushing
Yale 16-5.

Against Mt. Washington last Sat-
urday, the Generals got in a hole
early after two quick goals in the
first period. But they battled back to
within one, 4-3, The Wolfpack turn-
ed it on late in the first half and
took a 6-3 lead into the locker room.

The Generals scored twice in the
second half to close within one
again, 6-5. But the Wolfpack kept its
cool and went on to win 11-7,

Sam Englehart and Skip Licht-
fuss were the big guns against the
Wolfpack, each scoring two goals.
Don Carroll chipped in another
goal and contributed two assists. Ed
Tognetti scored a goal and won
several face-offs, Bryan Chasney
helped the cause with two assist,
and John Lalley added one assist.

Two different teams played Yale
last Monday. The team that showed
up in the first half was lethargic and
Yale took advantage of it to ser-
ounge a 4-3 halftime lead. The team
that came out in the second half was
totally different, scoring 13 straight
goals enroute to a 16-5 win, Coach
Jack Emmer said he had “a heart
to heart talk” with the team at half-
time. Whatever he did, it worked,
“That's the first time I've seen them
play with that kind of tenacity, said
Emmer. They didn't concede any-
thing. When they get motivated,
they can be giant-killers.”

Speaking of giants, there will be
plenty of them around at the Hero's
Tournament this weekend, On Fri-
day, the Generals take on Cornell
at 3:00. The winner of the W&L-
Cornell game will take on the win-
ner of the Hobart-Maryland con-
test on Saturday, with the two losers
also playing each other,

Cornell, national champion
years ago and Ivy League champ
last year, is not as strong this year
but should be plenty tough, “Cornell
has so many good young people that
it'll be a good game, said Emmer.
He feels that WAL's experience in
tough games should provide the
edge. Hobart, another possible op-

two

ponent, was 17-1 last year, losing to

Budget Restricts Dance Board,
Refunds Promised To Students

We wish to address ourselves to
the two most outstanding issues
which ‘have confronted the Dance
Board during the year: (1) the “qual-
ity” of the entertainment provided
and (2) the number of concerts and
the (legal) nature of the dance plan
contract, Antagonists we surely are
not—to accept the responsibility
and the work necessary to the pre-
paration of a program is a chal-
lenge we are glad to accept. It is
one thing to work constructively to
better the institution; still another
to criticize an accurate understand-
ing of the situation.

Concerning the “quality” of the
groups presented, they have repre-
sented our honest attempts to pro-
vide, quality entertainment. The acts
of “unquestionable” quality: ‘Tull,
Neil Young, Yes, and Chicago, to
name a few, have long been de-
manding prices which remove them
from the scope which a Doremus
concert may project. This is exactly
our dilemma, and the finances have
long been the crux of the problem.
The 1971-1972 Dance Board receiv-
ed $19,000 from the sale of dance
plans in advance of any pre-season
bookings. Adding a six thousand
dollar surplus amassed the previous
year, the Dance Board was able to
amass $25,000 and to put on four
shows. The year was not a success-
ful one in terms of student response.
Consequently, this year’s program,
with Richard Middleton as president
received only $9,000 in advance
sales and the three concerts this year
have been presented within a budget
of only $12,000, Obviously, had this
year’s board been blessed with the
$25,000 budget of its predecessor,
six concerts would have been a real-
ity. As is now the case, with half
the funds we have presented three-
fourths the number of shows. Ac-
knowledging our severely limited
pre-season funds (which are a neces-

sity when entering into the booking
procedure), we sincerely feel that
our program has represented the
best of both worlds of entertainment
to the best of our financial abilities.

It is with ‘the second problem that
we feel that the true nature of the
discontention has sprung, involving
the number of concerts and the na-
ture of the dance plan contnact.
There will not be another concert
this year. Simply, we are unable to
finance another show, As to the na-
ture of the contract, its stipulations
involve, as many of you have
brought to our attention, a “pro-
mise” of a service to be performed,
in this case the projection of 6 con-
certs during the course of the year.
A promise iis a two-way proposition.
We never “promised” to present six
concerts if we were unable to pro-
cure the student funds necessary for
their projection. Perhaps the key to
the successful operation of the
Dance Board has always been that
essential element of faith. Without
jit we can never hope to be in pos-
session of the necessary bucks.

In short, with the money we re-
ceived we feel that the three con-
certs presented thus far were the
best we could sponsor with our re-
stricted budget and that we have
acted in your best interest. We have
now been forced to conclude that
the dance plan is an obsolete method
of procuring funds, and new pro-
posals will be announced early in
the spring term.

In thte meantime, we wish to re-
pay those faithful few who were
largely responsible for the program
this year. Preliminary reimburse-
ment procedures will begin on
Thursday and Friday March 22 and
23 between the hours of 9 to 4 in
the Co-op. Those who wish to re-
ceive some repayment will leave
their names at the tables and the ac-
tual reimbursement will occur in the
spring term as we currently have
several minor accounts outstanding.
The money you will receive will not
be a large sum, but we believe this

efforts can only be strengthened by

of Law Lewis Larue said withhold-

of the University’s contract with
the students, “It is reasonably under-

The issue very nearly came to a
head last year when senior Tom
Mitchell was indicted in the Fall

as now most of the pertinent evi-
dence was locked up in impending
criminal proceedings. The Univer-

Grading Habits Of W&L Faculty
Revealed By Student Investigation

(Continued from Page 2)
off of which teachers were throw-
ing papers. Others were coaching
them and I caught fragments of
sentences like, “turn the wrist more”
and “extend for better elevation
and distribution,”

In another corner of the room
were several desks, and professors
were slashing papers with red ink
pens over and over again, Here too,
the “coaches” would be advising.

I turned in disbelief and stammer-
ed, “You mean?”

The heartless laughter sent chills
up my back. “Yes that’s right, a
p-ofessor training ground! Here -
where we learn to grade and evelu-
ate papers with the greatest dispatch.
The only problem is what we're go-
ing to do with you, Gentlemen, quiet
please. Let's take a vote.”

The solemn congregation all rais-
ed their hands and pointed a massive
cauldron which bubbled and hissed
evily. My captor smiled and pushed
me toward it.

“What is it? What are you going
to do with me?” I asked, now fran-
tic.

“This is boiling red ink,” laugh-
ed the professor, “and that’s where
you're going my friend.” He made
a move to push me in,

off the platform that hovered above
the cauldron, As I dashed toward
the door, the other professors all
began yelling and to delay them, |
pulled a switch labeled “Danger”
and bolted up the secret stairway.
As | ran up the stairs three at a
time, | heard confused screams and
then a muffled roar. Whatever I
pulled must have been connected to

something pretty powerful. I reach-
ed the door and dove into the office,
breathing deeply and thanking my
lucky stars that I would be seeing
sunlight once again. I bolted the
sliding panel shut and quickly left,
locking the outer door as well.

Back in my apartment, I relayed
the amazing story to my best friend
who wagged his head in disbelief
and offered to share the Roma cook-
ing Rose he was enjoying. It was un-
believable, he said, no one would
ever buy that story,

I don't know, maybe it was a
dream, | had been pretty tense about
things this week, maybe it was just
a hallucination, It does seem pretty
wild, doesn't it? I'd go back there
but things have been piling up and
you know, like the professor said,

it’s really not that important, I've -

got to go now, the library closes in
an hour and I still need some titles
for the bibliography, I hope the pro-
fessor swallows it because I just
don't have time to read all the books
I should.

Page 2 THE RING-TUM PHI

OUTLOOK and REVIEW
The Floundering Fate Of The Phi

We W&L journalists, like old townies, enjoy reminiscing
about the Good Old Days. And actually, well within the
the present seniors, things were much better on

 

   

memory of
the campus journalism scene—at one time Washington and
Lee boasted two weekly editions of the Ring-tum Phi in
competition with each other, along with healthy staff num-
bers for the Ariel and the Calyx.

The annual election of Editors and Business Managers
used to be an intense and drawn-out affair, sometimes lasting
through the early morning hours. Competition on staffs was
extremely keen, and the jockeying for positions was exciting
and sometimes agonizing. In fact, in a typical year there were
as many as eight to ten people applying for each editorship,
for both the yearbook and the campus newspaper.

This interest in W&L journalism quickly waned a few
years ago. The Publication Board Elections have degenerated
into a rubber-stamp formality simply to confirm the appoint-
ments of the few persons that bothered to apply for the jobs.
For the past three years there has been no opposition in the
contest for Editor-in-Chief of either the Calyx or the Ring-
tum Phi.

Needless to say, this all adds up to a very distressing state
of affairs. To be sure, lack of competition for editorships is
merely a reflection of an overall decline in involvement in
many extra-curricular activities. But in publications, the prob-
lem is especially acute.

For this reason (as pointed out in the article on page one),
the Publications Board, in a meeting just before Spring break,
decided to appoint only a provisional editor for the Ring-tum
Phi—pending their decision, to come next month, on whether
or not to cease publication of the newspaper altogether.

The prospect of abolishing the Ring-tum Phi may come
as a shock to some, but, in the opinion of the Board, it seemed
like the only proper response at a time when participation in
these activities seems to be at an all-time low.

We are at somewhat of a loss to figure out why students
have failed to involve themselves in this area, Over sixty
current freshmen served as editors of their high school news-
paper; indeed, the figures are similar for the other three
classes as well. Yet none of these students is presently serving
on the Phi staff.

We concede that this lack of interest may be due, in large
part, to our own failure in recruiting efforts. Moreover,
neither the Ring-tum Phi nor the Calyx are in any way
connected with the School of Journalism, and, therefore, can
offer no academic credit for writing and editing.

furthermore, it could very well be that the Ring-tum Phi
is no longer meeting the needs of the students and the W&L
community in general. If so, we want to know about it—and
we have placed a questionnaire on the back page which we
hope each student will take the time to fill out,

But we still harbor the suspicion that W&L needs a
campus newspaper in some form. The argument has been
made that W&L is by nature dull, and, therefore, a news-
paper is condemned to reflect that dullness. Nevertheless, a
really good college newspaper will search out issues and stir
up interest in various university affairs.

This we have tried our best to do, No doubt we have
pleased a few (and angered many more) with our reports and
columns concerning fine arts, the drug bust, voting registra-
tion, black recruitment, coeducation, and the student elections.
ur purpose has been very simple: to provide accurate re-
porting and, at the same time, provocative and admittedly
opinionated observations on campus news,

We feel that such a service would be sorely missed were
the Phi to fold at the end of this year. Now would be a perfect
time for interested and able students, regardless of previous
to come forth and help to rejuvenate interest in
W&L publications. The Ring-tum Phi will hold a staff re
cruitment meeting next Wednesday, April 25, in Room 208
Center at 7 pan. Freshmen, sophomores,

‘ \perie nee,

of the University
and juniors are all urged to attend,

We realize that Phi, in its 80-year-old history, may have
outlived its usefulness; perhaps it shoud be abolished to make
new. fresh vehicle for student expression, One

way tor some

thing is certain: the W &l. student newspaper can be any)

thing its readers want it to be—as long as they show enough

interest to keep it going.

From time to time, we will
bring you short profiles of mem-
bers of the campus community
who have gone unnoticed but
have dedicated themselves to the
school. In this, a first in a series,
we focus on Mr. Detrick W. Ward,
a 20-year employee of the school
and director of plant and prop-
erty, grounds and maintenance,

When we entered the office of
Mr. Ward, located in the tractor
shed behind the ROTC building,
right behind the John Deere Leaf
Sweeper, he had just finished
lighting his pipe. The stringent
odor caused raised eyebrows
amongst our research staff but
Ward quickly rose to his feet and
shook hands warmly. On closer
inspection, Mr. Ward had com-
mon leaves stuffed into his pipe.
When questioned, Ward grinned,
“Yep, where do you think all
those leaves we collect in the ‘all
go? We have to get rid of them
somehow, I make all my staff
smoke ‘em! We settled back and
began the interview.

“IT never thought I'd like it
here,” mused Ward as he put food
into the small fish tank he has
in his office, “After a while
though, this place sort of grows
on you, like Algae Sporotaneous.”

We asked Director Ward what
innovation during the 20 years
was the hardest to implement and
introduce to the University com-
munity.

“No doubt about it,” he said as
he puffed anew on his pipe, (a
brilliant orange maple leaf was
being stubborn and would not
ignite), “The whole place couldn't

age trench behind the Gym was

ing. Many say we lost that new
wing built in ’50 in the mud slide
because of that trench but I think
not. Anyway, the new gym is
built and we don’t have to worry
about that anymore.” Ward con-
cluded his statement on the gym
by saying that in his opinion,
the whole structure should have
been built facing the other way.
When asked why, Ward became
despondent and refused to com-
ment further.

Changing course, we now asked
Mr. Ward about his much-touted
“Project Cosmetic” that he has
been championing for some 15
years. At the mention of this,
Ward turned from the fish tank
where he had been making
strange cooing noises at a striped
porgy and smiled. “That project
was to be my one big contribu-
tion to Washington and Lee. I
was going to collect items for
each department that would en-
hance not only the individual de-
partment but the whole school as
well. Ward gave but three or four
examples of what he meant, “The
most difficult was going to be
the complete hip bone of St.
Francis of Assisi for the Religion
Department.” he said, “But that

photographie portfolio for the
English Department of Oscar
Wilde’s summer on the Darde-

nelles with his “good friends” was
a treasure as well.” Mentioned
briefly in addition to the above
were the Philosophy Department’s
inheritance of the rare voiume,
The Life Of Bennet Cerf, (lime-
rick portfolio included), and the
Spanish Department’s gift of a
vial of the stuff that Joselito
slipped in when he was gored
to death in Pamplona in '93. We
asked Director Ward where he

all along. Maybe you're afraid of
it, but it’s still there. If you think
vou can’t get there from here,
listen to Birds of Fire, The least
you'll find out is that some people
can.

You ean call it jazz, rock, jazz-
rock, or anything else, It isn't
true jazz, because it was painrs-
takingly sculptured in studios,
but the freedom of jazz permeates
the sound.

John MeLaughlin resolved his
duality by putting the 12-string
and G-string guitar into one in-
strument. Two necks mean much
more than twice as much sound
when used correctly. McLaughlin
doesn't really put out any more
sound, but it comes far clover to
perfection than his previous 6-
string work.

He has assembled a consort
which can go farther because it
travels together. Nobody sounds
out of place in this group because
they're all headed in the same
constant direetion: straight up.

Wednesday, April 18, 1973

The Country Club Groundskeeper

was going to get funds to pur-
chase these undoubtably priceless
articles.

“Oh yes, the funds. Well, 1
first thought that I would take
a collection from the students, A
little from each one would soon
have given me _ the_ required
amount. If it wasn’t for the
trouble in ’54 I probably would
have had the dough.”

We instantly picked up on the
referendum and pressed our ques-
tions. Ward was, at first, reluctant
to answer but complied after our
staff complimented him on the
arrangement of the fish tank ac-
cessories, especially the little
castle which bubbled.

“T guess it started when I be-
gan cutting the grass and sweep-
ing the leaves around the Quad
in the early morning, you know,
around 4 o'clock. For some reason
the students didn’t seem to favor
this hour for me to do my work.
At first the letters I received
were discarded because | thought
that these students were alone
in their complaints, Even after
several students came to visit
me down here I regarded them
as a minority. I believe it was
after the effigy of me was burned
in front of my house did I realize
that these kids have a real beef.
It was too late though for any
money collecting.”

The embarrassed silence in the
room was too much for Ward and
he rapidly changed the subject.

“If you guys want, I can tell
you a little about my new pro-

ject, “Operation Abyssinia,” which

I'm going to submit for approval
in the Spring, when it gets
warmer.”

“The project encompasses the
Main Campus, that is, the Colon-

marized concluding didactic argu-
ments than anything else, and the
sound is convincing.

The rest of the album is any-
thing but tedious, and its mes-
sage is really one of total

urgency. It encompasses what he
called sadjoy on an earlier album
(Extrapolation, Polydor PD 5510,
in case you're interested, and if
you like Birds of Fire, you will
be interested).

 

Maravishnu John McLaughlin,

nade, My plan is to decorate the
facades of each of the main build-
ings with the refuse and litter
our boys pick up around campus,
The project’s name comes from
those fancy mosaics they have in
Persia. We plan to coat the now-
existing bricks with a light plastic
layer and imbed the refuse into
it. When the whole thing dries,

you'll have a sort of mosaic
effect.”
“Tl figure if we can find the

right materials we can even make
pictures of Lee and Jackson on
horseback saluting each other or
something. Visitors to the campus
will be impressed to no end, what

do you think?”
Almost simultaneously our
whole staff looked at their

watches and chorused that it was
getting late and that we had bet-
ter be going.

“Before you smiled) Mr.
Ward, “Have something to hold
you over to dinner.”’ He produced
what looked like packs of gum.
We graciously accepted and left,
thanking him for his time. On
returning to our offices we found
that, true to our suspicions, the
packs contained beech and elm

There it is, an oh, so short,
glimpse of one of the men who
run this campus smoothly and
efficiently. Our hats are off to
you, Mr. Ward, and we wish you
many continued years of happi-
ness and creativity. Anyone who
wishes to visit Director Ward may
do so any time between 12:00 and
1:00 Monday through Friday. It
is imperative however, that the
visits be kept to a 15 minute
limit as Mr. Ward has lots on his
mind,

Another critic called this music
“vital jazz.” I can’t disagree. It’s
all here—total recognition of each
instrument’s possibilities, and in
a combination hard to find these
days, musicians whose abilities
match that recognition.

two very successful sea-

every game to be an easy win.
They don’t realize the ability of

Coach Jack Emmer has been a
bit perturbed by the apparent stu-

After

dent reaction to his lacrosse
team’s recent trip up North.
“People should realize that our

schedule consists of many other
tough opponents besides U.Va.,
including 4 in the Top 10, plus
the two top club teams.”

Coach Emmer’s club took preci-
little experience into the
Hero's Tourney, Their season was
still very young, and the tourna-
ment ineluded eight of the top
teams in the nation, The Wahoos
upset Maryland in the final, and
W&L grabbed third by defeating
the Carling Lacrosse Club. The
Generals had edged Cornell in
the opening round, and then been
overwhelmed by Maryland in the
semi-finals. On whole, the Blue
quitted themselves well against
the nation’s top ranked clubs.
John Hopkins, Navy, and Army
were among the top clubs not
participating.

Over spring break, the Generals
demolished Roanoke College, 16-
G6. John Lalley led the Blue with
three goals and one assist. The
contest was played in the mud
and rain at Roanoke. W&L man-
aged to put the game away early,
Coach Emmer substituted
freely in the second half.

teams in the Ivy League, have a
vendetta going on with Wash-
ington and Lee. They are upset
that W&L got invited to the
Tournament last year. They also
dislike the thought that we just

might play better lacrosse than
they. Those who attended the
Yale scrimmage could see the

“psych” potential in that club.
Ivies just love to beat W&L.

The Princeton game was played
on a cold and windy day. It was
a see-saw contest, with both clubs
grabbing the lead and then losing
it. Princeton lead by one going
into the last minute of regula-
tion. Skip Lichtfuss scored with
0:50 to go, to send the game into
overtime. Teddy Bauer scored the
winning goal, to give him a game
total of 3 goals and 2 assists.
Coach Emmer commented that
Skeet Chadwick had a good game
in the goal for the Generals.

Next, the Blue traveled to C.W.
Post, a Long Island school. La-
crosse is big in this area, and the
Generals expected quite a con-
test. But the W&L defense rose
to the occasion. Hastings played
in the goal in the second half.
Dave Warfield scored four and
had one assist.

To close out the trip, the Gen-
erals took on Towson State, the
nation’s 9th ranked team. A con-
ference game, Coach Emmer call-
ed this one of the most important
of the tour. In now typical fash-
ion, the Blue allowed Towson to
open up a 2 goal lead. After trail-
ing 6-3 at the quarter, they man-
aged to tie it up at 7 apiece by
halftime. The first half saw W&L
having troubles controlling the
face-offs. But the second half
saw Chip Tompkins take over
early, and control this depart-
ment for the Blue, They grabbed
a two goal lead, and then lost it.
With the game knotted at 10
apiece, Chasney scored with 0:58
to go. Eight seconds later, a
Towson defenseman scored to tie
it up again. Tompkins won the
subsequent face-off. The ball went
to Bauer, who scored unassisted
with 0:20 seconds in the ball

Baseball, Tennis, Track
Close Successful Tours

All of Washington and Lee’s
spring sports teams had success-
ful road trips during Spring Va-
cation.

The baseball team, bouncing
back from last year’s disastrous
spring trip, managed to win three
of six contests on the road. The
Blue opened up at Valdosta with
two games. The Generals started
off slowly, dropping both games,
0-7 and 1-2, The second game was
shortened due to rain, but the
contest was ruled official. In spite
of the losses, W&L played well.
Valdosta’s coach commented to
Coach Lyles after the two game

set, “You men have the best de-
fensive ball club we've seen so
far.”

Traveling to the Sunshine State,
the Generals opened a two game
stint with Eckerd College, alias
Florida Presbyterian. Eckerd car-
ried a 17-3 record into the series,
losing only to such clubs as North
Carolina, Harvard, and Riter.
Eckerd won their eleventh
straight when they defeated the
Blue 2-0 in the first game. But
the Generals rallied behind fire-
balling Rod Ferrandino to grab
a 3-1 victory and break the home
club’s streak.

The “Diamond Nine” finally
began to live up to Coach Lyles
high expectations. They swept
two from Florida Tech by scores
of 7-2 and 10-2. Jeff Knauer and
Ellie Gutshall had the mound
chores. The pitching was excel-
lent, the hitting came around, and
the Generals “wheels” swiped 21
bases in the two games.

The Generals returned to Lex-
ington with a respectable 3-5
record, much better at this point

than last year’s championship
club. More importantly, they re-
turn riding a big three game win
streak, a win streak built on some
tough teams. The momentum
should be three for today’s con-
test with Oneonta State. Follow-
ing the 3:00 encounter at home,
the Blue tangle with Madison on
Thursday and Hampden-Sydney
on Saturday, both at home.
Things are still looking up for
the Lyles club. Some players
have been moved around, and the
line-up have been juggled, but
there is still a good attitude with
the players. As Co-Captain Ellie

Gutshall and third sacker Don
Hathway both quipped. “From
here on out, we're gonna be

tough.”

Coach Tom Davies’ tennis team
had an even more successful
Southern tour, After losing to a
strong South Carolina squad, 9-0,

Freshman Mike Burns’ and
Junior Doug MecNeel led the W&L
contingent in Monday’s Boston

Marathon. In the process, Burns
set a W&L marathon record,
breaking the one that he had

set in the Duraleigh marathon.
He ran the 26 mile, 385 yard
course in 2 hours, 57 minutes and
21 seconds, cutting 43 seconds off
his previous best, In the process,
Burns finished a close 213th be-
hind winner Jon Anderson of
Eugene, Oregon, who crossed the
finished line and dove into the
shower in front of the Prudential
Building in 2 hours, 16 minutes,
and 3 seconds. McNeel finished
a respectable 466th.

Both students were pleased
with their performances, and
Burns’ only comment immediately
following the race was “I can’t
believe I ran the whole thing.”

The race began in the smali
town of Hopkinton, and ended in
downtown Boston, The course ran
mostly through residential areas,
and a little bit of the Massa-
chusetts countryside.

The most outstanding side of
the race was the mammoth spec-
tator participation. Crowds lined
the course, many offering the
passing runners refreshments—

ing was in itself an accomplish-
ment. But for both to be in the

participants was simply amazing.

students if they were convicted.

A similar situation currently
exists at Charlottesville, where
four University of Virginia stu-
dents were among 22 arrested in
a drug bust March 26 and 27.

According to the Cavalier Daily,
U.Va.’s newspaper, that school’s
administration is refraining from
any action on the cases for the
time being. The newspaper quoted
Associate Dean of Students An-
nette Gibbs as saying, “We can't

do anything now because this is
all alleged. We have not gotten
in touch with the authorities to
see what action will be taken. It
would not be fair to the students
or to anyone else.”

Hummer is the first W&L stu-
dent arrested in last November’s
bust to go to trial. Two more will
be tried next week in Rockbridge
Circuit Court. Seniors Douglas
Bruell of Cleveland Heights, Ohio,
and Kevin Darby of Huntington,
N.Y., will be tried April 26.

OUTLOOK AND REVIEW

Should Degrees Be Withheld?

As is the case whenever students find themselves in conflict
with the law, the November arrests of eight Washington and
Lee men on drug charges is still having its reprecussions
for everyone involved. The long-drawn legal proceedings are
trying not only for the students but for their friends and
families as well. Since that first evening spent in the Rock-
bridge jail, the students have received all kinds of unwanted
publicity, and, furthermore, must still wait to find out how
those arrests will affect each of their future lives.

Moreover, the drug bust has created dilemmas for others,
besides those directly involved. Paramount for the University
is the problem of disciplinary action. What should the Uni-
versity—administration or Student Control Committee—do
with regard to the indicted students? Should some University
action be taken or should the cases be simply ignored?

These are very real and difficult questions, one which have
plagued students and administrators alike for months since
the initial arrests. A strong case can be made for the tradi-
tional need to maintain university disciplinary sanctions: for
one, our Honor System specifically states that there are no
limits—geographical or substantive—to its proper enforce-
ment. A W&L student has always been held responsible for
his behavior at any place and under any circumstances as long
as he is representing himself as a member of the W&L stu-
dent body. Secondly, many members of the faculty feel (and
legitimately so) that a degree from Washington and Lee
must be protected from any kind of debasement—or, in other
words, that the power to withhold degrees from students
under judicial indictment should be retained.

So then, should the students in the present situation,
many of whom will not have had their trials before their
scheduled graduation day, be denied their degrees pending
review after their legal procedings are rsolved? Should they
be placed in a kind of “double jeopardy” by the university
at all? The answers to these questions, at this point, have
yet to be found.

For one thing, there is little or no precedent for a dilemma
of this nature, Oh, a few years back one student pilfered a
carpet from a Lexington merchant and, more recently, another
played Jesse James by holding up a local gas station, But
these students saved university officials from grappling with
the discipline issue by vountarily withdrawing from W&L
and heading for the hills.

In addition, drug cases are entirely different in that the
laws allegedly violated and the undercover operation itself
are so immensely unpopular. Many students are so familiar
with the very drugs cited in the counts that they are sym-
pathetic toward the few that get caught and accused of deal-
ing wih them, Furthermore, nearly everyone concedes that the
penalities for such crimes are much too harsh.

So any felony conviction involving drugs—be it just or
not—is going to have a different character, in the minds of
most students, than a different sort of serious crime. The
members of the Administration know that. So do the mem-
bers of the Student Control Committee. And they realize that
they would be immediately cast as the villians of the hour
were severe university action taken against the students pres-
ently embroiled in the courts.

We suspect that, in the present situation, university action
will be passed by. And perhaps that is the most fair and most
realistic resolution to the question, considering the current

climate. No university inquiry could be made, of course, be-
fore a student’s trial in the courts, for fear of prejudicing his
case there. And to withhold the students’ degrees, at this
juncture, would only compound the discomfort and embarrass-

ment of this whole episode.

A resolution was introduced at the last faculty meeting
which would provide for withholding of degrees from students
when disciplinary actions were not complete. The resolution,
now under study, would not go into effect until 1974 and,
therefore, would not concern those indicted in November.
The faculty should be extremely careful in consideration of
these proposals, but some provision must be made so that
the University’s disciplinary posture will be clear should such
a situation ever arise again. —N.E.P.

On The State Of The Phi

Whether the Ring-tum Phi is to be abolished after this
term is a decision to be made by the Publications Board on
May 8. Until then, we of the Phi can only try to secure the
paper's existence as an integral part of this campus by taking
steps to justify the paper’s existence and to adapt the paper
more to the needs of the students.

Last week's questionnaire on the Phi (see story on page
one) was a major step towards our self-evaluation, as it were.
Major trends seen in the results of the questionnaire do seem
to give us at least some idea of what the W&L student body
thinks about the Phi,

The poll revealed that most students, in reading the paper
weekly, turn to the Phi for its news and its letters to the
editor. This seems to indicate importance of the paper to the
students if only as an information sheet and a forum for
the airing of student wrath. Indeed, the vast majority of
students filling out the questionnaire recognized the need of
a publication such as the Phi for information and for use as
a forum, as well as for entertainment.

The poll also showed that students would generally like
to see more columns and greater news coverage in the Phi.
And they also indicated they would like to see the quality of
writing in the paper improve. In fact, the lack of quality writ-
ing was the major complaint of the students.

But to fulfill these wishes of the students, the Ring-tum
Phi needs more than just the same four or five people doing
most of the work on the paper every week, And it is here
where most of the problems of the Phi lie—not enough stu-
dents are interested. Our news coverage can't be complete
unless we have reporters to cover all the news. We can't
improve the quality of the writing if some writers get stuck
writing three or four stories every week, and if the editors
are too busy writing the copy instead of editing it for quality.

The point is that the future of the Phi rest with the W&L
student body. No paper can be published unless there is a
staff to put it together, And no good paper can be published
unless there is a good staff to work on it.

Tonight's organizational meeting of the Ring-tum Phi will
be a crucial step in determining the fate of the paper. If no
student interest is expressed, the Phi will probably cease to
exist after May 8, But a sincere showing of student interest
will be a positive step towards salvaging the Phi and re-
building it to better serve the needs of W&L students. But
the choice is up to those same students.

A History Of The Cockpit

In Its Former Grandeur

By J. JASON HATTHEWS
and DAVE FINNELL |

« .. And just remember this, a
kiss is but a kiss, a smile is but
a smile...” The smoke, the white
piano, the red carnations all melt
into a chalky but pleasant scene.
The piano player is asked to play
it again, and the long silver gowns
of the women rustle between
songs. Where are we? Casablanca?
Cafe de la Paix? The Stork Club?
No, we are at the Cockpit, its
deluxe red-velour wallpapered
walls shimmer in the mysterious
glow of the gas-light lanterns.

This exotic gathering spot has
offered many hours of relaxation
and enjoyment to DUBYANEL
and Lexington residents alike, But
what of its origins? What of
the stories that are told to open-
mouthed freshmen about the
countless intrigues that have
raged on its svelte wooden dance
floor?

The Cockpit, constructed some-
where at the turn of the Winter
Term by popular and_ interna-
tionally famous  restauranteur
Dean Weaver of Rockbridge
Baths, was at first, staunchly
opposed by everyone in the Lex-
ington community. The governing
fathers believed that the new
‘dinner-club’ would naturally
draw ‘bad blood’ from the big
syndicate strongholds of Stuarts
Draft and Chicago.

Disregarding their warnings,
Weaver, (nicknamed “shotglass”
by close friends because he al-
ways wore a small crystal measur-
ing cup on his head, delighting
his guests as he made the rounds
of the tables at the club), went
ahead with the painstaking con-
struction, Ultimate control of the
liquor and numbers percentages
was decided quickly after open-
ing night when power bids by
Cosa Nostra thugs from Chicago
and Kansas City were squelched
by the Galax and Troutville 4-H
strongarm torpedoes,

During Prohibition, the Cock-
pit held the somewhat infamous
distinction as the main distribu-
tion point of Dr. Pepper and
Pam Vegetable Spray in the whole
Shenandoah Valley.

Later, the Cockpit further broke
restaurant tradition with the ex-
citing floor-shows that drew
people away from the rival club
at Natural Bridge. This advant-
age was taken away by the un-
timely and as yet unexplained
death of the top-billed “Monty
the Singing Collie” and the sub-
sequent disappearance, (many be-
lieve phone threats scared him
into fleeing), of hilarious ‘second
banana’ Jerry Sugar, the only al-
bino midget giraffe to perform on
the stage.

The years of competition be-
tween the Cockpit and the
“Drama of Creation Lounge” at
Natural Bridge were many and
certainly stormy. One particular
favorite story was the time when
Weaver, then old and losing con-
trol of his club, opened one day
to find his entire restaurant litter-
ed with a grisly cargo. On the
tables, the walls, draped over the
chandeliers were dead roosters,
their blood was every where.Feath-
ers added to the mess, and be-
tween sneezes the grizzled
Weaver muttered through clench-
ed teeth, “Get the boys, we're
going to pay Natural Bridge a
little visit.”

The story differs from here,
but it is generally agreed that
Weaver's ‘touch men’ threw burn-
ing paper bags filled with manure
into the plush “Drama of Crea-
tion Lounge.” The opposition’s
burly bouncers rushed to stomp

out the flaming objects. Several
weeks later, the boys from Na-
tural Bridge had packed up and
were gone forever. However, the
damage had been done and the
name Cockpit stuck.

With Weaver's eventual death,
a quick, fierce struggle for con-
trolling interest ensued. The
lucrative Bonomo Turkish Taffy
franchise was at stake at the time,
and many thought that to control
the Cockpit was to control the
Turkish Taffy pie. After the dust
cleared, the celebrated vamp and
owner of the failing dancing-din-
ing Hedgepeths Club, Prissy
Crooner, took over and for years
the Cockpit basked under her
wise and thrifty hand.

She instituted the no-nonsense
practice of seperating the men
from the women in segregated
‘uni-sex’ booths, and with the in-
creased power due to her appoint-
ment as head of the pin-boy
union at the bowling alleys, she
was able to effect a ‘check be-
hing the ears’ policy before ad-
mitting any guest.

It was during this ear of the
Cockpit that the infamous Travel-
ler Seance Hoax rocked the lives
of everyone in the area, Miss
Crooner sponsored the seance
which was conducted by the lynx-
eyed medium from New Market,
Madame Lobotome. The room was
filled with guests from around
the area and after many incanta-
tions and much groaning contact
was made with Traveller, the fam-
ous war-horse of Gen. Robert FE.
Lee.

The inventive steed tapped the
answers to many questions in a
concise and oft-times witty fash-
ion with his hooves. Yes, he was
happy ‘over there’ in the big
paddock in the sky, yes, the
‘massa’ still prized his after-din-
ner ride, and no, the General's
socks were not still falling down
into his boots. Of Washington and
Lee itself, Traveller spoke warm-
Iv, but grew despondent when
he was questioned about his long
stay in the basement of the chapel
as a ‘stuffed exhibit.” The whole
affair degenerated rapidly though,

when from beneath her billow-
ing skirts, Madame Lobotome
dropped to the floor a pair of
coconut shells that hed been
strapped to the inside of her

knees.

Today the Cockpit provides the
members of the community with
a heady combination of urbane
conversation and sophisticated
yet racy fun. An_ Impressive
menu awaits to surprise the pal-
ate, while the nostalgic tunes
that waft from the juke-box carry
the happy diners down memory
lane. Many sav the charm and
elegance of the place has passed
into oblivion with its colorful
owners,

True, the owners are gone, but
the charm still resides in the
dark polished gleam of the wood-
en walls, in the traditional over-
stuffed red table chairs, in the
service and the impeccable cater-
ing given to each and every guat.
As in all things, the rising costs
have made it impossible for the
Cockpit to offer the deluxe “Old
World” services that were once
taken for granted. But let the
diners and seekers of good fun
go there for the sheer enjoyment
of sitting where the most wonder-
ful Mr. Weaver once lounged, or
where, en route from Richmond
to a hunting fete in Kentucky,
Seott Fitzgerald and Zelda came
for a quick drink and to get
sick in the nearby washroom
Gom these days, but
memory of them still lives,

Square dancing, even in our
“back to basics” climate has not
completely overcome its country
bumpkin stigma. But the 50 or so

students and faculty members
who showed up at last Firday
night’s square dance, held beside

the ROTC building, were largely
unaware that they were enjoying
what, four years ago, they would
have ridiculed as “corny.”
Actually, square dancing is only
one more bucolic institution that
this denim clad generation has
borrowed from the “hill people.”
The country-style informality that
spawned square dancing compli-
ments the post-Woodstock counter

Both types of musical events
offer an arena for disposing of
inhibitions (through music and
other stimulants). And both are
in sharp constrast to the “but-

sixties.

No doubt, many of the dancers

were attracted not by the danc-

Film Committee Presents
Kazan’s ‘East of Eden’

Another movie cult hero comes
to the screen of duPont auditor-
ium tonight at 7:30 as the W&L
Film Committee presents the first
major film performance of James
Dean in Elia Kazan’s “East of
Eden.” Admission is free.

Tne prototype for the anguished
youthful actor, Dean was the first
mummer of the silver screen to
be identified with what was to
become “the doubts and protests
of modern American youth.” Ac-
cording to songwriter Don Me-
Lean in “American Pie,” even
Dylan made it “with a coat he
borrowed from James Dean.”

Based on John Steinbeck’s novel
about a family living in Califor-
nia in 1917, “East of Eden” ex-
ploits the Cain and Abel myth to
explore the mores and relation-
ships of, in, and about an Ameri-
can family on the threshold of
bustling days and a new United

States. Yet the hero of this tale
remains the “rebel without a
cause” transplanted from _ post-

WW II to pre-WW I America.

Gulf Oil Donates $2500
For Student Recruitment

The Washington and Lee Stu-
dent Recruitment Committee has
received a grant of $2,500 for dis-
advantaged students from the
Gulf Oil Corporation.

One of the functions of the Stu-
dent Recruitment Committee is to
raise funds for financial aid for
underprivileged students. Gary
Avery, who led the fund-raising
project, said that it had sent out
nearly 70 requests to philanthro-
pic foundations but had not count-
ed on an immediate response from
the Gulf Oi! Corporation.

Larry Evans, who heads the
committee, contacted the Gulf Oil
Corporation over spring break
and it responded immediately.

Avery said that this grant was
the first Gulf Oil has given to an
eastern college other than to those
having sizeable constituencies of
alumni employed by the corpora-
tion

OUTLOOK AND REVIEW

Watergate: Point and Counterpoint

A View from the Left

To those of us who place ourselves anywhere left of that
pseudo-existant point we call the center of the political spect-
rum, Watergate has now seemingly become a sit-back-and-
watch affair where we can praise the Washington Post for a
fine job of investigative reporting and where we can level al-
most any blasts we wish at the Nixon administration.

Yet, we cannot really sit back and watch, for the whole scan-
dal unveils a deep insight into America’s politics, an insight not
only into the G.O.P. or Mr. Nixon, but into the entire scope of
the American political scene. There are many examples of this,
but only two are needed to at least suggest this insight.

Firstly, we must turn to Mr. Nixon’s Monday night chat,
in which he accepted full responsibility for any involvement
his administration has in Watergate. The President blamed the
scandal on the fact that he did not run his 1972 campaign di-
rectly; rather, he let his aides and friends do the campaigning
for him,

Mr. Nixon's campaign in 1972 was an experiment, as Frank
Mankiewicz keenly noted here in the Contact program, in the
new politics—it was a campaign without the candidate. Mr.
Nixon was simply sold to the American public without ever
having to concern himself with the public or with the campaign
which was selling him. And this is what caused Watergate.

Conceding the point that Mr. Nixon has at least a minimal
set of scruples, we see that if he had watched his campaign
closely, Watergate simply could not have happened. Mr. Nixon
would have squashed any scandalous bugs, hopefully, before
they flew past the screen door, so to speak.

So, the question of Mr. Nixon’s entire 1972 campaign as
an experiment is brought up here, and we see it has miserably
failed. Indeed, other Nixonian experiments—his administrative
structure and his view of the loftiness of the American presi-
dency high above Congress and the people—may also be shown
to have failed by the implications of Watergate. We only hope
that Mr. Nixon now realizes this and that he takes appropriate
measures to at least rid America of two of his experiments still
being conducted—his administrative structure and his views
of the Presidency’s loftiness—before their failure is implanted
permanently upon American politics in a manner similar to his
campaign.

But as we noted earlier, the implications of Watergate go
far beyond Mr. Nixon, and we cite the case of the typical liberal
as an example of this.

It is sorrowful to note that the Post, for all its fine reporting
and continued pressure upon the scandal, was quite alone in its
war against the administration.

For sure, liberals were attacking the administration daily
during the campaign, but their attacks bore only a half-hearted
“shame, shame” compared to the Post's blasts. The liberals were
content to merely imply that something was buggy about
Watergate, without really worrying about finding out what
that something was.

Thank God for the Post, ye complacent liberals. While you
only lashed the Nixon administration, the Post was finding out
why you were lashing it, and that paper was lending some
credibility to your lashing. The point is that, without the Post
and other papers risking their necks to find out the truth, the
Watergate Seven would simply have been dismissed as the
Watergate Seven, without any consideration as to the revision
of the number involved, Certainly, investigations were con-
ducted, but it was the Post and other papers that made an in-
depth investigation worth even considering. The liberals have
little to be proud of when one looks at the whole scope of impli-
cations made by Watergate.

We hope that these two example of the far-reaching implica-
tions of Watergate actually define these implications and their
scope. And we hope that Watergate has not only indicated
some (but not all) the flaws of Mr. Nixon, his administration,

Cabaret—This Week at the Cinema 1

and the G.O.P., but also countless other flaws in our entire
political system—from the current structure of political cam-
paigning in America to—yes, even the basic spinelessness of the
American liberal.

PJ.L.

Looking from the Right

The dams have finally broken wide open at the Watergate,

flooding the White house itself and washing away Messrs.
Haldeman, Erlichman, and Dean in its tide. Presumably, John
Mitchell saw the storm coming late last year, when he abandon-
ed ship as head of the President's Re-election Committee.

Whether the President himself will weather this tempest is

yet to be determined. Despite Miss Jean Dixon’s much-touted
prophecy, there seems to be no way that he can come out of this
mess with a stronger reputation. The very best he can hope for
is for his name to be cleared, in the subsequent proceedings,
from any direct knowledge of or implication in the break-in.
As Mr. Nixon admitted in his television address Monday night,
the very fact that his administration is involved makes him re-
sponsible for any wrongdoing. No matter what occurs as facts
unfold in the coming months, Mr. Nixon will be held account-
able for Watergate, if not at the polls, at least in the history
books.

His speech on Monday night was not very revealing and

was replete with typical Nixonian bathos. But in its rhetori-
cal nature and style it was not any different from any other
speech the President has given before the cameras during his
tenure in office. Nearly all of the
whether on the trip to China or the mining of Haiphong, have
been marked by the same kind of hyperbole and patriotic cliches.
It is easy for us, with all our flippant sophistication, to laugh at
the President's rhetorical overkill. But when the President says
“God Bless America,” who can say with certainty that he
doesn't mean just that?

President's announcements,

Beneath all the self-justification of the President's speech,

there were some hopeful signs. For one thing, he extended an
olive branch to the press, praising them for their “vigorous”
pursuit of the truth in the Watergate story. Secondly, he had
admiring words for the “courageous” judge who is presiding
over the case, John Sirica, who is himself a Republican appoin-
tee. And finally, Mr. Nixon pledged himself to a full disclosure
of the facts, however, painful to himself and the administration.
Whether he keeps that pledge remains to be seen, but the ap-
pointment of Elliot Richardson to be Attorney-General seems
to be a step in the right direction; though he may not have the
independence of an outside prosecutor. Mr. Richardson is un-
deniably a man of ability and integrity.

The vital point to be remembered is this: no matter how

this whole sordid affair is resolved, we all lose. The implica-
tion of the scandal go far beyond Mr. Nixon’s personal reputa-
tion or that of the GOP. For those of us who feel there has been
much to admire in both the foreign and domestic policies of the

President, the Watergate affair is utterly debiltating. Tragic-

Nixon's favor from Day One.

ally, we stand to see the real and important accomplishments of
the administration completely obscured by some bungled poli-
tical antics perpetrated in a campaign that was decided in Mr,

This is not to reduce the harsh significance of the Watergate

debacle; it must be cleared up-—-unsparingly and rapidly—to re-
store confidence in the Presidency, But no one really stands any-
thing to gain by smug prejudgment before the facts are in; the
only ones who can rejoice at the current developments are those
professional Nixon haters who operate not out of a deep sense
of moral outrage, but rather out of their own ideological zeal.
For these people, even if the President is ultimately absolved,
it would simply be further proof of his “trickiness.”

As we said, in an affair like this, none of us come out smell-

ing like roses.

Letters To The Editor

Dear Sir:

This letter is written with the
trembling hand and_ throbbing
head of what was once a great
athlete. I was always popular at
school because of my prowess on
the athletic fields, and there were
days when I would literally have
to sprint through the parking lot
at my high school to make it to
my car before the hordes of girls
engulfed it and started rocking it
back and forth on its packed-up
shocks. But now all that is gone,
I sit friendless, confused and on
the verge of rash acts. Why? Ill
tell you why!! It’s those damned
new rules for volleyball, that’s
why!!

When the intramural volleyball
season started, I knew that it
would be my finest hour. I had
been the star of repeated frater-
nity practice sessions and my
brothers quickly coined the nick-
name “Spike King” for me. I had
amazing control over the mam-
mary-like V-ball and my incred-

ible quickness stunned lesser play-
ers, The first night of competition
was a different story. New,
strange and utterly exasperating
calls rang in my ears like “two-
handed dig”, “two-handed spike”,
and “you're under the net buddy.”
Point after point was lost because
of these strange alien rules, and
I felt my face flush with hot
shame as I heard two co-eds gag-
ging with laughter in the corner
of the old gym. What happened to
the normal, descent, American
rules we all know and love? Why
have — bleeding-hearts liberals
foistered these leftish changes on
us? I think there’s something
fishy going on here. Listen, I’m
not sour grapes or anything, but
I'd like to be informed about the
whole thing, if you know what I
mean, Next thing you’ know,
they're going to exempt pitchers
from batting in the All-American
sport of baseball!
Warily yours,
Steven Corbin '73

Sundry Views Mark
Prisons Conference

The Virginia Conference on Cor-
rections wound up a_ three-day
stint here Saturday, and the only
thing everybody agreed upon was
that the current American “cor-
rectional program”’—the current
prison system—has to be chang-
ed.

There was quite a lack of agree-
ment on how it should be chang-
ed. Former U.S. Senator Charles
Ek. Godel! highlighted one stand
taken by several people in his re-
marks to the conference Friday
morning. Goodell called today’s
prison rehabilitation a “fraud,”
but he did concede that the notion
of imprisonment is a valid one.

Godell asked for the “decrimi-
nalization” of the  victimless
crimes such as gambling and pros-
titution when the offense is
against beliefs or standards rath-
er than against individuals or pro-
perty.

Godell also noted a tendency
towards over-punishment in to-
day's prisons. He said punishment
must be administered without
passion.

Martha Wheeler, head of Ohio's
women's prison, expressed the
view that lawmakers have failed
to keep abreast of changing stand-
ards and moral patterns in soc-
iety. She also said that today’s
prison system is not useless.

John O, Boone, director of the
Massachusetts prison system, said
the most effective rehabilitation
or corrections system can lie out-
side the prison walls. He said soc-
iety must develop other responses
to crimes than just locking a per-
son up. He cited probation as of-
ten being more effective overall
in reform procedures.

Governor Linwood Holton, in a
speech Friday night to the Con-
ference, focused on the problems
of Virginia's prison systems. He
ealled for a shift in the restructur-
ing of the state's corrections in-
stitutions from larger settings to
“Smaller, more diversified treat-
ment units.”

Holton emphasized the need for
individual treatment in the re-
habilitation program. He said Vir-

ginia has made “real progress” in
this direction.

Holton also said he does not
foresee the complete elimination
of prisons in the state’s correc-
tional programs. He noted the ex-
istence of a “small element of so-
ciety” that will have to be isolat-
ed by prisons.

The three-day conference cen-
tered around the theme, “Work-
ing Together in Corrections.”
About 240 prison administrators
and other persons involved in cor-
rections attended the conference.
The conference was brought to
the Washington and Lee campus
by the university's School of Law.

Hollins College:
The Views Of
Returning Girls

All of us who attend academic
institutions are aware of the cri-
ticisms constantly being voiced
concerning the standards of our
schools. In fact, it is the academic
establishment which has fostered
this critical spirit. Many at Wash-
ington and Lee have criticized the
University for being too slow
moving, too static. The students
want coeducation and other re-
forms to be instituted. Although
these changes may be genuine
improvements, what about the
values of the university that are
neglected.

Hollins College is going through
a period of change and reevalua-
tion as is W&L. Hollins is faced
with the problem of a larger and
larger number of their students
taking leave of absences, going on
exchange programs or transferr-
ing to other schools, In the March,
1975, issue of Hollins Columns
Monty Simmons looked at this
situation at Hollins. Her article,
“Attrition: The Ones Who Came
Back,” offers the opinions on four
of ten students who returned to
Hollins,

One girl stated:

“*l had to leave because | had
to have a change in order to ap-
preciate this. . | would never
send a child of mine to a univer-
sity first. I'd send her
place like Hollins first because
your freshman year you don't
know where you're going.”

Some apparentiv appreciated
Hollins more once they had left
its campus. They left to get a
taste of the real world that was
perhaps missing at Hollins

“*They had it together—social
us well as academic. You can In-
tegrate the ‘real world’ and aca-
demics at the university, Hollins
makes you study five days and
play two days—hard!"’

They found the advantages they
had sought in larger, coeducation
al universities but they found dis-
advantages they had not quite ex-
pec ted

to some

“*The bureaucracy there really
hits vou in the face, All the has
els really make you appreciate

Emmer Attacks Pollsters,
‘It's WHO You Play!

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s lacrosse team keeps winning
games but dropping in the polls,
and it’s beginning to bug W&L
coach Jack Emmer.

“We didn’t ask to be ranked
fifth (in early and pre-season na-
tional polls),” Emmer said recent-
ly, “but for some reason some
people thought that’s where we
should be ranked. Now, here we
are undefeated (after eight
games), and yet we keep slipping
in the polls.”

From their lofty fifth-place
ranking early in the season, the
Generals later dropped to sev-
enth, and now are eighth in the
two major polls, the Associated
Press rankings chosen by vote of
lacrosse coaches, and the Balti-
more Sun poll, selected by that
paper’s sportswriters. (The Gen-
erals are back up to seventh this
week).

Emmer feels it’s not “how you
play, but who you play” that has
a lot to do with the poll rankings.
“If you are a ‘Big Five’ school
(John Hopkins, Maryland, Vir-
ginia, Army, Navy), your results
against another Big Five school
play a minimal role in the rank-
ings. Look at Army’s 23-8 loss to
Maryland, or Navy’s 14-7 loss to
Maryland, Both Army (No. 5) and
Navy (No. 4) are still ranked very
high.

“It seems that anybody who
simply plays John Hopkins (No.
1) or Maryland (No. 2) enhances
their poll standing regardless of
the outcome.

“But if you are not a Big Five
schoo] and you win a close game
against a good team, you drop in
the rankings,” Emmer continued.
He cited as examples W&L’s one-
goal victories over 14th-ranked
Cornell (national champion two
years ago and Ivy League champs
last year), Carling Lacrosse Club
(last year’s national club cham-
pions), Towson (ranked 10th) and
Princeton (19th). The Generals
also have defeated Washington
College (16th) and ‘North Carolina
(20th).

“They are all very good teams,
and we won, yet we lose ground
in the polls. I don’t understand it.”

While not meaning to down-
grade those ranked above W&L,
Coach Emmer feels his Generals
should be higher. “I feel we could
more than hold our own against
at least five of the seven teams
rated over us,” he said. “I feel we
can play with any team in the
country.”

5-1 dual meet record and a sixth
place finish in the VCAA Tourna-
ment,

Fallis established the new
school mark in the discus at 147
feet, 2 inches against Roanoke
mid-way through the season. Al-

though short of that distance in
the VCAA’s, he captured a first
for the team. The following Tues-
day he scored W&L’s only points
in the state meet with a fourth
place. He ranks as a top contend-
er in the upcoming CAC cham-
pionships.

The 440 vard relay team broke
the old standard with its third
place finish at the VCAA meet.
Paced by John Newmann and Phi-
fer Helms, the team raced to a
43.3 clocking, finishing behind
Virginia State and Hampton In-
stitute. Helms also starred by
winning the 220 yard dash in 22.1,
a tenth of a second ahea dof the
next two finishers.

Stickmen Roll On; UNC and W&M Fall

By PAUL CAVALIERE

The NCAA-bound Washington
and Lee Generals finished another
week with two impressive wins,
one over North Carolina, which
was ranked 20th at the time, the
other at the expense of the Wil-
liam and Mary Indians,

The Blue beat UNC by the
score of 14-9, but the game was
not as Close as the score indicated.
Before the reserves were put in
the fourth quarter, the Generals
maintained a 13-4 lead. The scor-
ing was well distributed with
Sam Englehart (3 goals) and
Bryan Chasney (1 goal, 3 assists)
leading the field. The game was
highlighted by the defensive per-
formance of goalie Skeet Chad-

wick and defensive man Don Ea-
venson who shut off UNC’s super
attackman Bruce Ledwith.

The William and Mary game
turned out just as expected, with

the Generals jumping out to a
big lead, 9-0 at the end of the
first quarter, and 12-1 at half-
time. From this point the Gen-

erals coasted home to a 23-5 win
with the subs playing a good part
of the second half. The Generals
displayed some excellent passing
and some very unselfish
work. Once again Skeet

Wilson, Spicer Are Co-Winners

Of Academy of Poets Award

Robert S. Wilson, a senior from
Brownsburg, and John T. Spicer,
a sophomore from Roanoke, have
been named co-winners of this
years’ Academy of American
Poets Poetry Prize at Washington
and Lee. They will divide the $100
award.

Mr .Wilson’s entry, “First Im-
pressions,” was a free verse poem
about a bittersweet love affair.
Mr. Spicer’s poem, written in
rhymed quatrains, was an evoca-
tion of loss of an old bridge, and
its replacement by a new one that
marred the environment, It was
titled, “Bridge in the Country.”

The judges of the contest, Dab-
ney Stuart and Edwin Craun of
the English Department, express-
ed regret that more of Washing-
ton and Lee’s student poets did
not enter the contest.

TONIGHT—Clear, low in mid 50's,
TOMORROW — Partly cloudy,

high in low 80's.

Sweeping new changes involy-
ing the current University Center
Committee have been initiated
for next year by the incoming

1973-74 Executive Committee,
The restructuring of the Uni-
versity Committee into a Stu-

dent Activities Board was brought
about primarily to prevent dup-
lications of activities and func-
tions by different extracurricular
activity groups, such as the two
film programs now run by the
EC Film Committee and the Uni-
versity Center Committee.

The restructuring involves the
naming of a chairman to head the
entire Student Activities Board
and four sub-chairmen to head

four subcommittees.

A prime function of the new
committee will be to coordinate
scheduling of all activities on
campus, not only to prevent dup-
lication, but also to spread out
activities in a balanced manner
over the entire school year.

All campus organizations will
have to notify the Student Activi-
ties Board of any planned activi-
ties to prevent conflicts and dup-
lications.

The Film Subcommittee will
combine the present EC Film and
University Center Committees to
present a balanced scheduling of
films throughout the year.

The University Center Building

the board’s

Subcommittee would be in charge
of all organized activity in the
building.

The Recreation /Entertainment
Subcommittee would plan and
possibly financially support acti-
vities ranging from combo parties
to square dances to other enter-
tainment. The subcommittee will
be separate from the Dance
Board.

The Culture Subcommittee
would arrange fine arts and other
cultural programs, including
drama presentations, panel dis-
cussions, and programs similar to
“Wednesday Forum” initiated
this year.

The committee and subcommit-

tee chairmen will meet weekly,
according to the resolution passed
10-0 by the new EC. They will be
responsible for scheduling of all
events, including Contact and
Dance Board concerts.

The new EC formulated the re-
structuring in cooperation with
Ken Lane, director of the Univer-
sity Center.

Petitions for chairman and sub
chairmen positions on the new
Student Activities Board are due
Monday, May 14, at 6 p.m. in the
EC mailbox in the University
Center. The new EC said applica-
tions should include the position
applied for and the _ telephone
number of the applicant.

OUTLOOK andREVIEW| 73-74 President-Elect Schwartz
Talks On Drugs, Honor System

Does the Faculty Respect Us?

The University Council met last Thursday afternoon in
a truly remarkable session, For the first time since the creation
of the joint student-faculty body a few years ago, the Council
voted right down the middle on an issue—all the faculty mem-
bers voting in a block against all the student members. Never
before has there been a question placed before the Council
which catalyzed such a clean-cut disagreement between the
Teachers and the Taught.

With two student members missing and with the academic
deans adding to the majority, the faculty won the day and the
plan was defeated,

The proposal which prompted this historic occasion was,
admittedly, a controversial one from the start. The new EC,
headed by Student Body President-Elect Doug Schwartz, pre-
sented a plan to alter the make-up of the Courses and Degrees
Committee. It called for increasing student representation on
the committee from one to six, and making it a parity body
with six counterpart faculty representatives. The proposal, in
addition, carried an informal endorsement from the present
Executive Committee.

The students who presented the plan, headed by Schwartz
and Lewis Powell, anticipated the faculty reaction exactly.
This would be one more student incursion into faculty do-
mains, one more incremental relinquishment of faculty power
in university policy.

And that is precisely how most of the faculty members on
the Council reacted to the plan. English professor John Evans,
who picked up the banner for the faculty side, wondered im-
mediately why such changes in the power structure always
occurred in favor of the students and at the expense of the
faculty. If the EC was really interested in the sharing of
power between students and faculty, he asked, why haven't the
students invited faculty members to join in the administration
of the honor system?

The point was clear: the Trustees of Washington and Lee
have expressly entrusted the Honor System to the students ;
and likewise, they have entrusted the faculty with responsibil-
ity for the curriculum and the academic realm.

One can understand the faculty’s reluctance, therefore, to
yield power in this area. But when examined more carefully,
the EC’s proposal would not actually upset this “separation of
powers” as intended by the Trustees—rather, it would trans-
late into more student input and influence, (not power) in
determining and molding their curriculum,

Schwartz and Powell kept re-emphasizing this distinction
in their argument for the C&D plan. The faculty, they said,
would retain full control over the granting of degrees; there
would be no student say-so in this realm at all. Furthermore,
the faculty at large would reserve the right to reject any re-
commendation made by C&D.

So what the students were asking was this: a more direct
channel into decision-making in matters of rules and course
content. And this is where the analogy between the Courses
and Degrees Committee and the Honor System is solely in
student hands, presumably because only students, not faculty
members, are tried under its jurisdiction. On the other hand,
every student is inevitably affected by the courses he takes,
any many students make the claim (quite justly) that their
point of view concerning courses can and should be as con-
structive as their professor's.

Now whether or not all this demands parity representation
on C&D is another matter. But one thing is clear: most stu-
dents do not feel that their opinions and ideas are being listen-
ed to and considered with the attention they deserve.

Does the faculty actually respect what a student has to say
concerning the academic aspects of university life? The meet-
ing on Thursday focused on this crucial question when Dr.
Cc. W. Barritt asked, “What harm would it do to have six
students sitting on C&D?" The best answer that could be
wiven was that C&D recommendations would no longer be
considered with as much weight by the faculty. Or, in other
words, respect for the committee would be undermined merely
by the addition of student members.

~ Now this attitude on the part of the faculty may be, in
fact, largely justified, Surely, the responsibility for correcting
this mistrust lies as much with the students as with the fac-
ulty. As is the case so often, student performance working with
C&D so far has not been particularly stellar, And, according to
several C&D faculty members, the Curriculum committee,
whose frustrations provided the impetus for the EC plan,
failed all year long to think out their proposals and to present
them authoritatively.

But no matter how this dilemma is specifically resolved,
something has got to be done soon. The faculty has to show
that it has confidence in the maturity and judgment of the
W&L students. And the students, whatever position of re-
sponsibility they hold, must make every effort to show them-
selves worthy of that confidence.

This is the first of two articles drawn
from a recent interview with Doug Sch-
wartz, second year law student and presi-
dent-elect of the W&L student body, This
week's article airs some of Schwartz's views
on the honor system and on the situation
involving the W&L students who were ar-
rested in a drug bust last November, Next
week, Schwartz discusses the Phi, coeduca-
tion, the EC, and the lack of community on
the W&L campus.—Ed.,

What do you think are the basic problems
with the Honor System at W&L?

I guess what it gets right down to is a
very simple problem with our honor sys-
tem as it is today. It does not work, and
for a simple reason. You are putting stu-
dents in a position of finding a person guilty
and kicking him out of school forever, or
finding him innocent and taking no action.
The EC has a tremendous problem kicking
anyone out of school to begin with. There
has to be fairly extreme circumstances and
a fairly extreme clear cut case for the EC
to vote to kick somebody out.

Once they do this then that person would
be crazy not to go to a public honor trial
where it is nearly impossible to get a public
jury to kick anyone out short of something
extremely serious, more than just plagiar-
ism or stealing chairs. This is mainly be-
cause with many of the people I talked to,
they will not kick someone out for one mis-
take which will affect the rest of their lives.
It is too harsh a penalty in most circum-
stances. I agree that many times a person
has done something wrong and deserves to
be punished, but when the only punishment
is expulsion, to take action is untenable.
So what’s the good of having only this ex-
treme penalty, if it will never be used. The
faculty is probably losing faith in the stu-
dent’s ability to run an honor system.

What do you propose in lieu of the pres-
ent system?

The EC will vote for guilt or innocence,
the same way they did before. Once they
establish guilt then they vote, based on
equity where the punishment will fit the
crime, whether the person deserves expul-
sion or suspension for one year, It’s a very
minor reform, and the result of it would be
to make the honor system enforceable. Stu-
dents will turn other students in and there
will be convictions when need be.

In reference to the recent drug busts on
campus, what do you feel the school’s role
should be in relation to the accused and
convicted students?

These students are in the position they
are in because of their sheer bad luck. I
wouldn't hesitate to estimate that at least
80% of the student body at W&L uses or
has used marijuana. Then for any student

organization, such as the SCC, to sit back
on its high haunches and say, “well, he’s
guilty, he should be kicked out of school,”
is to me just bullshit. No action should be
taken, The university should be doing every-
thing they can to protect these students.
These students will no doubt be severely
hurt by these charges, and there is no
earthly reason for the university to punish
them further by withholding their degrees.

These guys are going to suffer for the
rest of their lives for doing things that in
our generation is not at all criminal in our
minds. Although the law is still behind the
times. Probably within three years the laws
will be changed. Seven of these men are

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

going to be graduating. They've fulfilled
their course requirements and have done
well and there is no reason for the univer-
sity to turn around and say “you've been
convicted of a felony, we don’t want you to
have a W&L diploma.” There are many
people who have done far worse things than
this. And if they do anything to the stu-
dents involved in the drug bust, then they
should recall all diplomas from anyone who
has ever been involved in a crime. Therefore
I think that the University should do noth-
ing academically against these students.

How would you suggest that W&L han.
dle these types of cases?

Since in the past there has been no ex-
plicit policy on how to handle a case such as
this what the university has to do first is
develop a policy and then put in into effect.
They cannot ex post facto put it into effect
upon these accused students. The university
can hardly condone the use of drugs, but
the university should not condemn the use
of drugs. The use of drugs is too widespread
and too pervasive for them possibly to say,
“we condemn the use of drugs, we're going
to kick out anybody who uses them.”

The use of drugs at W&L is widespread,
however these men have been indicted on
selling of drugs. Isn’t it incumbent on the
school to take some action, for it cannot
even tacitly condone the sale of drugs?

First of all, Sisler was unable to prove in
any way selling of drugs, All he was able to
establish was accommodation of drugs, and
in Virginia law there is a distinction be-
tween possession, accommodation and sell-
ing of drugs. These men did not go out and
solicit the sale of drugs. They accommodat-
ed friends. Two undercover agents became
close friends of these students. They smoked
dope with these students, drank beer, shar-
ed their dinner, their wine, shared their
homes and hearth with these students as
good friends, then turned around and asked
them for dope, asked them for marijuana
or hashish, and in one case mescaline. These
students did not go out in the streets and
say, “we want to sell you this.” There was
no profit made.

Also, I think these undercover agents
were allowed to smoke marijuana. Here
they are breaking a law, and then turning
people in for breaking that same law. The
only way they caught these students was
by breaking the law. I think that’s pretty
damned disgusting. Therefore I don’t feel
the university should condone this form of
arrest by taking any sort of action against
these students. Furthermore, the honor sys-
tem covers lying, cheating and stealing, and
these men infracted on none of these rules,
which is, ineidently why they were not
brought in front of the EC.

The W&L Honor System... Is It
Out of Step With Changing Times?

Tim Kearney submitted this ar-

vour fellow

students not to lie, hooks from the

bookstore and all faith in itself to enforce the

ticle to raise some serious ques-
tions about the current W&L
Honor System. His views do not
necessarily reflect those of the
Ring-tum Phi.—lEd.

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s Honor System is based on
mutual trust between students.
It states that they shall not lie,
cheat or steal, implying that stu-
dents have faith in other students
to live according to this code.
Someone long ago chose the era-
dication of lying, cheating and
stealing as having moral and /or
practical value for our academic
community, Why did he choose
these three standards? Why not
choose to discourage breaking
drug laws, statutory rape, and
speeding? Obviously the former
pertained more to the University
than did the latter when the
Honor System was drafted in the
nineteenth century, Are these
three behavioral guides still per-
tinent today? De we have faith
in our fellow students today to
refrain from lying, cheating and
stealing?

The drafter of the Honor Sys
tem made it one’s duty to expose
known violations of the Honor
System. In a sense we became our
brother's keeper. To benefit from
the freedom of this Honor Sys
tem one must seek faith in the
system, in essence one has to
trust his fellow students. Faith
comes from knowledge, Statisti-
cal knowledge or intuitive knowl-
edge that your faith will show
vou we're right, creates strength
and use of a system, If the facts
(knowledge) betray your trust
and faith, then your faith will be
haken each time your trust fails
vou. Again, do you have faith in

cheat, or steal?

What is the function of the
Honor System? Is it to create fair-
ness academically so grading will
be a truer measure of achieve-
ment? Is it to provide function
for the university's Executive
Committee? Is it to create com-
munity trust in us students so
that the Lexington merchants
will cash our checks? Is it to
make our university more severe,
somehow more prestigious, to a
society that might value such
honor and trust? Whatever the
function of the Honor System, is
it meaningful to our student life
today?

Today our Honor Systematized
student life includes institutiona-
lized violations of this Honor Sys-
tem. What do you (we) do when
students from athletic teams keep
equipment and clothing long af-
ter they have stopped playing
for a schoo! team, when students
falsify their age to buy alcohol,
when students “souvenir” roads
signs and other public and com
mercial property with which to
decorate thelr rooms, and when
students say they'll do something
and then don’t without regard to
your expectation? We accept it.
This acceptance subtiy honors
these actions. We have created a
society that has institutionalized
petty theft and general dishonesty,
a society that must statutorily
expell some poor sucker who gets
caught Iving about some wood he
took from a burned barn that has
been abandoned, What do we do,
when students fall to return
books to the university center and
MeCormick libraries, when stu
dent workers take free meals
from the Cockpit when not work

ig there and when students take

textbook supply? We do nothing.
| dare say that some of the above
“new traditions” we would like
to keep. I think these violations
are rampant today and that we
all know about them, or commit
them ourselves. I think our be-
havior clashes with our image of
the Honor System.

I think the Honor System is
outof-step with our times. It de-
mands friends to squeal on friends
for petty theft when the student
community has sanctioned petty
theft by institutionalizing it. The
people who drew up the Honor
System obviously wanted it. His-
tory tells us that student bodies
of the past have lived by it. To-
day students’ acions plainly indi-
eate that they don't want the
Honor System in its present form
and punishment. Today's behav-
ior significantly shows that stu
dents do not want to police the
actions of their classmates, es-
pecially when it can result in the
classmate’s expulsion,

Why doesn't anyone change
the Honor System then? Because
they don't have te. Nobody today
turns anyone in, At this point, |
acknowledge those few suckers
who got caught and who are the
irony of our Honor Systemitized
<tudent community,

| think lying, cheating, and
stealing are still practical things
to discourage in our community
I think the present Honor Sys
tem faile miserably to do so, |
suggest that the Honor System by
its severe punishment is unbal
anced, The punishment outweighs
ninety-nine per cent of the vio
lations and more importantly that
it ia the direct cause of many vio
being

ition nevet exposed |

think oul tLudent badly has lost

code it imagines it still lives by.

Perhaps next September we
should write an Honor Code that
we will fee! obliged to uphold and
participate in, After a hundred
years perhaps we should vote to
see if the student body wants an
Honor System.

This article necessarily lacks
details and statistics, it is rather
general in its comments, due to
the irony that the Honor System
is so structured as to not allow
a factual study of its effective-
ness. Please think about the ques-
tions posed and maybe write your
Executive Committee member. |
suggest, for those interested, to
ask professor Leach about the
number of stolen books in recent
years from the library. Also, to
consult the cold check committee
about the recent deluge of bounce-
ed checks, or to ask the athletic
department about the number of
missing supplies, would yield in
teresting statistics, Ask anyone in
the Cockpit for a free meal,

Baseball Team Still
Can Reach NCAA’s

By TOM RAMEY

Baseball is a strange game, and
playing it at W&L this season has
proved no exception. The Gen-
erals started out slowly, gained
some momentum with a very re-
spectable Southern tour, and have
since been struggling to maintain
a .500 record, Yet all is not lost.
It was revealed Monday that the
fourth and final NCAA playoff
berth is up for grabs between
W&L, Madison and Morehead,

The sole roadblock for the Gen-

Ruggers to Face
WEM May 12

The W&L ruggers will finish up
their season May 12 at William
and Mary. The team will be going
into the game cold, playing its
last game two weekends ago.

The squad split two contests
that weekend, dumping Duke on
Saturday, 9-4, and losing to the
University of Tennessee Sunday,
13-6.

The Tennessee game marked
the initiation of the Confederate
Cup, a trophy which will be
fought for between the two
squads twice each year—once in
the spring and once in the fall.
W&L led the Tennessee squad at
the half, 6-0, on a tally by Jeff
Davies and conversion by John
Markley, but the Volunteers came
back on two penalty goals to tie
the score at 6-6, Tennessee con-
tinued its second-half surge to
clinch the victory.

Prime consolation for the W&L
ruggers after the loss was that a
General was the only one capable
of chugging a Confederate Cup-
ful of brew.

crals lies in one weekend of base-
ball, which will include the CAC
championships, and a make-up
doubleheader with Apprentice on
Sunday. Should the Generals
sweep the contests, the berth
should come our way. W&L’s rec-
ord would be identical to Madi-
son's, with the Blue having play-
ed a much stiffer schedule.

W&L has the potential to go
all the way. According to Coach
Lyles, “It takes three strong start-
ing pitchers to win the CAC and
we, already being defending
champs, have the pitchers to
carry us through the hectic CAC
schedule into Sunday’s double-
header.” The Generals will rely
on the arms of Rod Ferrandino,
Jeff Knauer and Haller Jackson,
and the sticks of Don Hathway
(.367), Jeff Knauer (.296), and
the long ball hitting of Ellie Gut-
shall,

The Biue currently stand at
7-9, including losses in the 11th,
13th, and 14th innings. The Gen-
erals recently swept a double-
header from Old Dominion, the
team which kept them out of the
playoffs last season. This past
Friday they split with Bridgewat-
er by tallies of 1-2, 6-2, with Jack-
son picking up the win in the late
game, Monday, the club dropped
an 8-3 decision to VMI.

While scraping its nose to get
above .500, just like last vear, the
ball club finds itself in position
for playoffs. Coach Lyles says,
“This has been a good team yet

they have received no recogni-
tion. It’s discouraging.”
The CAC championships will

be played Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday afternoons up on the
baseball! field. Other teams in the
tourney are Sewanee, Centre, and
Southwestern,

CAC Festival
Slated Here

Washington and Lee University
will defend its College Athletic
Conference championship _ this
weekend when it hosts the CAC
Spring Sports Festival.

CAC members W&L, Centre,
Sewanee and Southwestern
(Tenn.) will compete in four

spring sports: baseball, golf, tenn-
is and track, They are vieing for
the President’s Trophy, a 300-
pound locomotive bell symbolic
of the overall conference cham-
pionship.

After competition in two fall
sports (football and cross-coun-
try) and three winter sports (bas-
ketball, swimming and wrestling),
Washington and Lee has a slim
lead over Sewanee, 85 points to
75, Centre is a close third with
60, While Southwestern — trails
with 25.

W&L's toughest competition is
expected to come from Sewanee,
whcih is always strong in the
spring sports, Southwestern is the
team to beat in track, while Cen-
tre will be tough in tennis and
baseball.

The W&L Tennis squad is
carrying an 1-2-7 record with two
more matches’ scheduled this
week, one with Hampden-Syd-
ney and the other with Emory
and Henry. The Blue netters will
go into this competition with one
championship under their belts—
the VCAA’s,

Washington and Lee captured
championships in tennis, golf, and
baseball last year to wrap up the
overall title. Sewanee should give
the Generals a run for their
money in all three sports. Base-
ball, a round-robin affair, is a
toss-up among the four teams.

Southwestern will bring a stable
full of speedsters to defend its
track championship, The Lynx
currently hold nine conference
records, and three of the record-
holders will return to perform on
W&L's Wilson Field track Friday
and Saturday; Herman Morris,
John Keesee, and hurdler Ralph
Allen.

LEXINGTON GOLF COURSE—

The Lexington Golf Course is
an interesting little place where
one can sharpen certain aspects of
one’s game. If you can chip and
putt well, Lexington is the place
to go to lower the old average. It
is a relatively short (par 71)
course where a good drive leaves
you only a wedge or short iron
from the green on many of the
par 4's,

The greens are undoubtedly
the course's outstanding feature
with traps and bunkers coming
in a close second, For four dollars
you can play all day (with the
price going up to five dollars on
weekends and holidays). Because
of rain, I was only able to play
the back nine, but I think it is
the most interesting of the two.
Here is a hole-by-hole description
with each hole’s outstanding
points being stressed.

No, 10—This 394 yard par 4 has
you teeing off over a pond with
the green being set back slightly
to the right. Nothing spectacular,
a small creek in front of the
green is the only other hazard.

No. 1l—This par 5, 510 yard
hole can get you in real trouble
It doglegs sharply to the left
about 150 yards out so use an bron
off the tee unless you play a dri-
ver way to the left, The latter is
not recommended because the

fairway slopes sharply and be-
cause the grass is sparse, the
ground is very hard, making it

tough for the ball to hold.

W&L, U.Va.-The Game

 

By PAUL CAVALIERE

Washington and Lee's sixth
ranked Generals rolled over two
more opponents this week to
bring their record to 11-0, They
beat previously undefeated Frank-
lin and Marshall, 21-5, and trounc-
ed Baltimore University 16-7.

In both games the Generals
came out firing and scored almost
at will in the first quarter, and
then coasted home to victory.
They were unable to score in this
fashion a the outset of the season,
and this led to their trailing early
in many of their contests. Coach
Emmer now hopes that the team
can put its confidence and its
stickwork together to beat the
University of Virginia on Wilson
Field Sunday.

“The U.Va. game could well be
the biggest game W&L lacrosse
has ever played,” said Coach Em-

No .12—You can cut this dogleg
par 4 with a real good drive, but
the fairway is the worst on the
back nine. It is 388 yards from
the white tees with the fairway
poorly defined and the grass de-
pleted by heavy erosion.

No. 13—This is definitely not
an unlucky hole. Measuring only
301 yards, it really plays shorter.
Uniess you duckhook your drive
it is virtually impossible to get
into trouble. The green is easy
to read (as are most of the
course's) and in top shape, One
disadvantage is that they have
not gone to the trouble to put
fringes on the greens.

No, 14—This is a short 132 yard
par 3 with a gently sloping green.
No real trouble, The traps on this
hole typify those on the rest of
the course. Well trimmed on the
edges, you will never find clumps
of grass growing in the traps
themselves. They are well drain-
ed and are filled with fine white
fluffy sand.

No. 15—This is a short par 4,
only 348 vards from tee to green
Only trouble Is the white stakes
on the right for you slicers and a
big bunker on the left for you
hookers

No, 16-—Another real short pat
i (this one only 338 yards) it can
be trouble, There are woods on
the right and the finger of a lake
that extends nearly
fairway about 235 yards out. A
good drive and you could be in
It is a lot safer to tee off with a

undefeated going into the final
game of the regular season. Cur-
rently the Generals are 11-0. Even
though the Blue are ranked sixth
and playing on their home field,
they still will be the underdogs.
Coach Emmer hopes that the
entire student body will come out

likely be reminiscent of last year’s
affair—a high scoring contest.
Momentum will be essential.

rounding these three (3) cases, it
was decided that they should be
handled as the exception rather
than as the rule. Among the ex-
tenuating circumstances consider-
ed were the following:”

1) There are 9 cases involving
graduating seniors. At this point,
only 3 will appear before the SCC
because we do not feel we can
justify a hearing until after the
evidence is presented in civil
court and 6 of the 9 cases will not
be heard until after graduation
this year, We feel that, due to the
close relationship of all of these
cases, severe action taken against
only 3 of the 9 would be grossly
unjustified.

2) Although the 3 individuals
we considered are at this point
convicted felons, it should be re-
cognized that there are degrees
of criminality. The accommodat-
ing nature of sales to friends in
these cases must be considered as
opposed to an active, profitable,
“pushing” of drugs to non-stu-
dents and minors.

3) It is felt that the actions of

these students should in no way
be taken lightly, but especially in
light of the above point these stu-
dents have already received
enough penalty, They are now
convicted felons (with all the
ramifications this will carry in
later life), they may very well
spend time in the penitentiary,
they have been and will be placed
under a heavy financial burden,
and finally the pressure under
which they have been placed has
affected them academically.

1) Severe penalty appearing in
their pre-sentence reports might
have an adverse effect on sen-
tencing.

5) There was no_ widespread
understanding among the student
body that the University would
feel the need to take action were
cases such as these brought to
light.

“The recommendation the Stu-
dent Control Committee made to
the Student Affairs Committee
(i.e, that no further action be
taken) should not be taken as an
apathetic stance, There are cases

four wood and take a little longer
chip to the green. The hole dog-
legs left, don’t make the mistake
of playing to the 17th green which
is the only one you can see from
the tee.

No. 17—Another short par 3, it
is only 131 yards, but it is all
carry as you hit to a fairly large
par 3 green. This hole has the
worst tee on the back nine. You
only have 20 yards in back of the
green before you run into a
swamp so the tee shot leaves lit-
tle room for error,

No, 18—A truly majestic finish-
ing hole it is undoubtedly the
most scenic hole on the course.
It is a 488 yard par 5, The fair-
way goes down a long hill which
has a lake at the bottom of it,
about 450 yards from the tee. A
good drive will really carry, but
the rough on this hole (as it un-
fortunately is on the others also)
is allowed to grow apparently un-
checked, It is very easy to lose a
ball off the tee because you can’t
find it in the rough and the dan-
delions at this time of year make
it especially tough to pick a ball
out of the seemingly millions of
white blossoms that line the fair-
way. If you can finally get to the
green you are faced with one of
the most undulating greens I’ve
ever seen. If the pin placement is
right, a putt hit too strong may
stop rolling about 10 yards off the
green. All the greens are hard
and difficult to hold, but the 18th

The Need For Needed Change

Last week's restructuring of the old University Center Com-
mittee by the 1973-74 Executive Committee is a welcome move.
Many of the problems of the old committee have been elimi-
nated, at least on paper, by the establishment of the new Stu-
dent Activities Board,

Foremost of the many functions of this new board will be
the coordination of all university activities in regards to the
scheduling of events. All planned activities, including those
of Contact and the Dance Board, will be reported to the board
to prevent conflicts of events and to schedule activities evenly
throughout the school year.

This will indeed be a relief, particularly to those students
and faculty members who remember the 21-day marathon in
which Black Culture Week, Contact, and the Glasgow [n-
dowment Program brought a deluge of 15 major speakers and
events to this campus. As pointed out in this column earlier
this year, such a deluge was just too much for most students
and professors to contend with, and the three programs, each
exceptional in itself, lost some of their exceptional qualities by
virtue of their proximity to one another,

Hopefully, the four subcommittees under the Student Activi
ties Board—Film, University Center Building, Culture and
Recreation/Entertainment—will also aid in scheduling and im-
prove the student activities in general around campus.

If the restructuring is any indication, this campus can look
forward next year to some much needed changes thanks to
next year’s Executive Committee. Whether we are entering
the twentieth century or not can still be contested, but that
is not the point. The point is that we are not remaining static
and that we hopefully are not changing only for the sake
of change. We hope this move of the new EC foreshadows
further undertakings by the committee in the area of needed
change, for this university cannot continue to keep abreast
of other schools without such change.

A Little Fable

Once upon a time there was a sleepy little school in a sleepy
town ina beautiful and green valley with mountains all around.
The students at this school were like those anywhere else—
some slept all the time, some played, others walked around with
their noses buried in big thick books. During the spring there
seemed to be fewer and fewer with their noses in books; most
bought inner tubes and spent their Saturday afternoons float-
ing in big pools of beer or Southern Comfort.

Alas, it seemed for a long time that none of these boys could
become interested in anything but reading or floating all day
long. Until one day one got the bright idea of tying a net on
the end of a pole and tossing a ball with it. Soon everyone in
the little town was running up and down the football field,
waving their sticks, hitting each other with them, and having
a glorious time.

Then the WAHOOS came to town. No one knew what a
Wahoo was or where they came from, They carried sticks just
the same, tossed the ball quickly from one to the other—and
the people in the little town were sore afraid.

Then the people said, “Why don’t we leave our books and
our inner tubes and join together to beat back these Wahoos?”
And it was done. The books were tossed aside and the lovely
pools were drunk up dry—and everyone gathered to watch the
battle.

\t first it looked bad. In 90 seconds the Wahoos fiercely
threw their balls into the home ranks. Then a Skeeter gritted
his teeth and said, “The Wahoos aren't that tough.” And
sending their Teddy downfield, the people of the little valley
beat those Wahoos back into the hills.

It is said that the people of that sleepy little school will
never be the same again. Lookouts have been placed on all
the rivers, since rumors are spreading that a whole fleet of
stickmen will come sailing up to attack once more, Further
more, it is said that their captain will be shaking his fist for
revenge, since he used to be captain in the valley before he
learned to sail,

But the people in the little town are no longer afraid. They
have their Skeeter and their Teddy—so the only thing to fear
is fear itself. The End,

OUTLOOK andREVIEW! EC President Schwartz Speaks

On Coeducation, Other Issues

This is the second of two articles based
on a recent interview with second year
law student and student body president.
elect Doug Schwartz.—Ed.

at a ae

In an editorial appearing in the Phi be-
fore the run-off election, some of your
positions were questioned as simply cam-
paign rhetoric. How do you answer this
charge?

I remember the article real well, it ae-
cused me of campaign rhetoric and the
accusation that the EC was run by “Execu-
tive Fiat.” I think people remember that
right below it they had another editorial
concerning dis-enfranchisement of the co-
eds and their right to vote, and that since
they dis-enfranchised them that possibly
they are not governed by the honor system.
The strange thing about that was, was
that that was my campaign issue and that
the Ring-tum Phi basically got that from
hearing about me raising hell about the

co-eds not being allowed to vote, and that
wus one of my prime examples of the EC
ruling by “Executive Fiat.” There was
no vote or discussion by the EC, Bob
Brennan just announced that co-eds would
not be allowed to vote. And I promised to
that specifically as an example of “Execu-
tive Fiat.” The Ring-tum Phi is accusing
me of campaign rhetoric in pointing out
that the EC ruled by “Executive Fiat,”
right after that then pointed out my ex-
ample without my name or without men-
tioning the parallel I used, and I think the
Phi unknowingly answered its own charge.

What do you propose to do to avoid rul-
ing by “Executive Fiat” next year?

What we want to do is have a column
each week in the Ring-tum Phi which will
contain the complete EC agenda for the
next week, listed in an order so that it
will allow those who are affected to readily
discern what will be discussed and when,
\s far as Executive Committee Reorganiza-
‘ion goes, we are already under way re-
organizing the University Center Commit-
tee, which has in the past just organized
activities taking place in the University
Center. Basically our reorganization is go-
ing to rename it the Student Activities
Committee, and it will be responsible for
activities all over campus. It will be under
the jurisdiction of the EC so that the EC
will be direetly responsible for bringing
activity to all the students and that way
EC funding will be more readily available
for these projects.

A major position in your campaign was
your stand favoring co-education, Do you
feel that the recent referendum on co-
education was significant?

1 think that it is undoubtly certain
that the referendum was extremely im-
portant and extremely telling. About 80%
of the student body voted, so I think that
it cannot be denied hat the majoriy of the
student sentiment favors co-education, There
is now a breakthrough; it is a psychological
breakthrough more than anything else, be-
cause students have for the first time gone
on record saying that we want co-educa-
tion. There will have to be another referen-

dum next year and it will have to win by
an even bigger margin.

What do you feel you can do to help
the implementation of co-education at W&L?

Work has to be started now, and there
is a Board of Trustees meeting in May,
and the positions and wishes of the stu-
dents will be made known and we'll see
how far we get there. In the interim what
I am trying to work on now is changing
the arbitrary ceiling on co-eds which is
set at 30. In the interim period between
now and co-education to reach W&L, if
in fact it ever does, there is no reason
to at least double the number of co-eds.
| think this is an effective idea because
the administration would have no objec-
tion to this, and it would be a very bene-
ficial transition period towards co-educa-
tion,

How do you answer those people who
point out that one can get co-education at
many schools throughout the country,
whereas W&L is unique in the fact that
it is unisex and therefore offers a viable
alternative?

The purpose of W&L is to give the best
education possible. It is not beneficial to
say that W&L has it this way and another
schoo] has it another way, and therefore
one can make a choice. What W&L should
be asking itself is what is the best way to
achieve the best possible education, and
if it can be shown that a co-ed school
gives the most complete education, then
for people to want W&L to remain unisex
is ridiculous.

A major problem at W&L appears to be
a lack of community, This point has been
underscored most recently in the apparent
rift between the law school and the under-
graduate school, What do you see as the
central problem causing this rift?

Before I take this question straight on
| would like to point out that I believe a
major eause of the lack of community on
campus is due to the lack of co-education.
People now, starting at the beginning of
the week look out to girls’ schools to fulfill
their needs off campus. They don’t look
into the campus to seek fulfillment in its
activities. I think that if we had women
on campus then the school itself could be-
come the center of activity, and would thus
focus attention directly on the W&L com-
munity.

As for the rift with the law school and
the undergraduate school, there are as |
see, two basic problems. First of all, there
is a great age and interest difference be-
tween the schools. Beause of this there is
obviously going to be some _ separation.
rhis separation has been exacerbated by the
fact that the law school has often been
cut off from effective representation by
the undergraduate school.

For example, in the last co-education
referendum the EC voted on a motion not
to allow law students to vote. The argu-
ment was that only those people directly
affected by co-education should vote on
co-education. This argument is totally fal-
acious, because using their own argument

 

LETTERS TO TH

won seven,

Phi two issues after
ior wu to get this one

they would immediately emminate present
undergraduate seniors from voting because
they will not be sitting in the classroom
when co-education goes into effect.

The main point is that everyone is affect-
ed if the W&L environment is changed by
co-education, so everyone should be allowed
to vote on it. The law school firmly believes
that everybody has something to gain by
a sharing of educational facilities and in-
tellectual stimulation and knowledge, All
the law school wants is full representation
which it is now getting, and financial
equity, which it will get. The law school
does not want to fund activities which it
has nothing to do with, such as the Uni-
versity Grain Parties, Ariel, Calyx, and the
Phi, which it has nothing to do with. They
do not want autonomy, just financial and
representational equity. | believe that these
two areas are being resolved already,

What is your opinion of the tension be-
tween W&L and the Lexington community?
What are the major causes of this tension
and can anything be done about it?

| guess every college surrounding a com
munity has its “town and gown” hostili-
ties, and Lexington is no exception. I do
feel that the town has directed a few
actions against the student body, such as
the restaurant tax. The one that I will
specifically talk about is the licensing and
registration, in the form of Lexington city
and Rockbridge county tags, which are
necessary for your car,

There is a definite problem here. Many
students tried to register to vote in Lex-
ington in the last election. Almost every-
one was refused because they were deemed
not resident for voting purposes, At the
same time these students are taxed as resi-
dents of Rockbridge County and Lexington
in the form of county and city tags. This
to me is the epitomy of taxation without
representation,

Furthermore, there is a Virginia statute
on the county tag issue which specifically
states that if you are a non-resident using
your car solely for the purpose of trans-
portation and personal pleasure, you are
not required to purchase a county or city
tag. The judge here says that a city ordi-
nance says that if you live here nine months
out of the year, you are deemed a resident
of the city of Lexington. Of course they
neglected this when people tried to vote,
The judge also made the crazy statement
that the city ordinance overrules and super-
cedes state law. This is just bunk.

What we are trying to do now is that we
are going to have a number of under-
graduates and law students go before the
EC to ask for $500 to bring an appeal be
fore the circuit court and eventually the
State Supreme Court. | hope the EC does
fund this projeet because legally the stu-
dents are clearly right, and there are
hundreds affected by this. If they can prove
that they are legal out of state residents
only using their cars for transportation
and personal pleasure, they should not be
required to purchase county and city tags
(Note, the EC has funded the project, and
the appeal is currently being carried out

Tennis Closes 16-7,
Captures CAC Title

The team played several teams
outside of their league which ac-
counted for most of their losses.
The Generals fell to Virginia,
Navy, Davidson, Harvard, and
VPI. The VPI match was a close
one in which the team perform-
ed well and went down in a 5-4
decision,

The VCAA tournament in Har-
risonburg, the weekend of April
27, was a resounding victory for
the Generals. In the nine division
competition, the W&L men took
seven divisions, The singles play
saw the team clean up by win-
ning at positions 1, 2, 4, 5, and
6, Junior Sandy Lawrence suc-
ceeded in capturing number one
singles in spite of a weak ankle

he had sprained the previous
week,

In fact, Lawrence was named
the best singles player at the

VCAA, Sophomore John Embree
won his match at position 2,
singles, Juniors Tim Thompson
and Warren Davis captured posi-
tions four and five respectively,
Captain Marshall Washburn took
the 5 spot for the Generals leav-
ing us with only one loss after
the singles.

The Blue kept up the pace in
the doubles by outscoring their
opponents in two of the three
divisions. John Embree and Tim
Thompson paired off to bring
Wé&L another win at the number
two position. Senior Steve Swen-
son and freshman Don Caffery
added a win to the team standing
by their play at number three
doubles.

The regional schools participat-
ing in the VCAA did not offer as
much competition for the Blue as
was expected. Hamden-Sydney
placed second in the tournament
action in Harrisonburg. Other
schools represented were Madison
College, Roanoke College, Emory
and Henry College, Bridgewater
College, and Lynchburg College.
W&L took the tournament with
65 points as compared with Hamp-
den-Sydney’s 36 points.

CAC Tournament

Last weekend the Generals won
the CAC tournament here by de-
feating Southwestern, Centre Col-
lege, and Sewanee College. It was
a round-robin tournament’ in
which W&L faced each of the
opponents in all nine divisions.
The Blue came into the tourna-
ment as defending champion.
The real contest was expected to
be between the Generals and
Sewanee,

Friday morning, May 11, saw
WE&L meet Centre College. John
Embree and Marshall Washburn
were our only winners in six
singles divisions, After singles
play Centre led the home team,
1-2. This meant that to win against
Centre we had to take all the
doubles matches,

The Big Blue pulled through in
doubles play and the final was
Wé&L’'s win, 54, The victorious
doubles pairs were Sandy Lawr-
ence and John Embree, Will

Diamond Bid Falls Short

They say that close is only

so close in 1973, but yet so far
away. For all practical purposes,
the ended this past Fri-
day when, in the seventh inning,
a bouncer to centerfielder Ellie
Gutshall hit a pebble only to
bound over his head all the way
to the centerfield fence. The
result was a 6-5 victory by Centre
over W&L.

Despite the fact that the Gen-
erals bounced back to defeat both
Sewanee and Southwestern to
take second place in the CAC
tourney, any aspirations for the
post-season NCAA playoffs slith-
ered away in the fateful seventh
inning of the Centre game. Dis-
couraged by the second place
finish, the Generals dropped a
game to Apprentice the following
day to end the season at 9-11.
“It was just one of those things,
something you cannot explain,”
remarked Coach Lyles in refer-
ence to the Centre game. “We
did not get the NCAA bid, yet I
was really proud of the boys to
bounce back as they did.”

The season was a disappoint-
ing one to the Generals, especi-
ally when one considers the pos-
sibilities that no doubt existed.
In reference to the season, Coach
Lyles said, “We could easily have
had and should have had a 15-5

On Saturday morning we faced
Southwestern and won resound-
ingly, 8-1. The only loss came at

number one position, singles,
where Sandy Lawrence fell to an
Opponent who was named the

best singles player of the tourna-
ment. Senior Marshall Washburn
came through the weekend un-

Steve Swenson and Stan Taylor
won their second CAC title for
doubles play. John Embree also
emerged sucessfully by being un-

Bogart Returns
Here Tonight

Humphrey Bogart returns to
W&L tonight in his last screen
performance, the 1956 “The
Harder They Fall,” presented by
the W&L Film Committee.

Based on the novel by writer
Budd Schulberg (‘What Makes
Sammy Run?” and “On the Water-
front’), the film is an expose of
corruption in the in the fight
business in the  not-too-distant
past,

Iix-sports writer Bogie and
crooked fight promoter Rod
Steiger lock horns in this one
as they push a South American
boxer (Max Baer) to the top in
a succession fixed fights.

The climactic match between
the out-for-blood champion and
the would-be champ Baer re-
mains one of the most brutal,
powerful indictments of the fight
game put on film.

The director, Mark Robson, is
also known for the classic box-
ing movie “Champion.”

The W&L Film Committee
wraps up its 1972-73 season next
week with Arthur Penn's first
film, “The Left-Handed Gun,’
which stars Paul Newman as
Billy the Kid in “one of the most
bizarre Westerns ever.”

Lewis Hall Ceremony
Planned For Saturday

Ground will be officially broken
Saturday, May 26, for Lewis Hall,
W&L’s $7-million law building.

The groundbreaking will take
place at 1 p.m., following the
close of the spring meeting of
Washington and Lee’s board of
trustees,

Frances and Sydney Lewis of
Richmond—whose gift of $9 mil-
lion last year assured construc-
tion of the new facility, named
for them—will attend the ground-
breaking. Mr. Lewis is a member
of the W&L board.

George W. Kane

Inc., general

firm based in Dur-
ham, N.C., has been awarded the
$5.7-million construction contract
for Lewis Hall. Costs of designing
and furnishing the building are
expected to bring the total cost
above the $7-million mark, ac-
cording to university estimates.

The building—which will per-
mit an expansion of W&L’s law
student population from 250 to
350—will be completed in 1975.
Its location is on previously un-
developed land owned by W&L to
the west of the Front Campus
area,

Iialian Sojourn Scheduled
In W&L Foreign Studies

A new program of study abroad
for Washington and Lee has been
approved by the Foreign Study
Committee and the Committee on
Courses and Degrees and is to be
forwarded to the Faculty for gen-
approval, to go into effect
with the Spring Term next year.

eral

The course, to be known as
Italian 202 involves six weeks’
study in Siena, Italy and is in

most respects comparable to the
programs in operation for the last
years in Paris and Madrid.
However, this course will not be
strictly a language course and will
involve studying in Italy during
the Spring Term in a field of the
studeint’s choice. Also, no pre-
vious knowledge of Italian will
be required.

The basic core of this program
will be a project in the field cho-
sen by the student and approved
in advance by the proper depart-

three

ment at Washington and Lee. An
English-speaking tutor chosen
rom the student body at the

University of Siena will be assign-
ed to each participant to aid him
in finding materials related to his
project and to the report he is to
on it. reports will be
graded for credit by the appropri-
ate department at Washington
and Lee, Credit ean be divided be-
tween the department of the pro-
ject and the Italian department,

write These

for a total of six credits.

A student may choose to take
more courses in Italian and work
in a field related to the Italian
language and culture and receive
all six credits in Italian. An addi-
tional advantage to this option is
that a student can complete his
entire Division I requirement in
one Spring Term.

Residence will be with Italian
families, as in the French and
Spanish programs. Additional lee-
tures and trips covering cultural,
political and economic aspects of
Italy will be included. It is likely

that some of the study will be
done in nearby Florence.
Travel to Italy will be by air.

The cost of the program will be
the same as the French and Span-
ish programs. Operation of the
proposed program is subject to
sufficient registration by students
in advance, Declaration of intent
must be made by Thanksgiving
and payment of the initial deposit
by the first of next year, Full pay-
ment will due by March 15,
1974. More specific information is
available from the Romance lan-
guage Department as well as sev-
eral other departments at Wash-
ington and Lee. Dr. Scharff of the
Romance Language Department
expects to travel to Siena this
summer to set up final arrange-
for the program.

OUTLOOK and REVIEW

Increasing the Student Tax

This week, Washington and Lee will probably see one of
the more important battles of recent times waged by W&L
students. No, we are not speaking of the lacrosse game Sat-
urday against Maryland, although that is certainly important
in its own right. Rather, we are talking about a battle by the
1973-74 Executive Committee to increase the student tax for
next year.

The present student tax is $17, and it is taken from the
comprehensive tuition fee of the university. It is interesting to
note that, for next year, the comprehensive tuition fee will
rise $300, while there has been no increase in the university's
allotment to the student tax.

So what's so important about the student tax? Money from
the tax goes toward funding a host of student activities—the
IC itself, all its subcommittees, the Publications Board, Ariel,
the Ring-tum Phi, Calyx, part of Contact’s expenses, the Stu-
dent Bar Association, and the Student Body Reserve Fund.

But the list of activities is constantly growing. This year,
the EC revamped and expanded its University Center Commit-
tee into an all-encompassing Student Affairs Board, and the
W&L Law News was initiated. The funds for both of these
have to come from somewhere, and under present financial
structure within the W&L community, the funds must come
from the student tax.

Not only are new student activities adding to the expenses
to be met by the student tax, but inflation is also leaving its
mark. Various publications take up a major share of the stu-
dent tax, and printing costs have been on a sharp upswing in
recent times. But it costs more to do anything nowadays, and
the EC must meet rising expenditures with fixed revenues,

There are two points to be made here: the comprehensive
tuition fee is consistently being raised with no subsequent
raise in the appropriations for the student body ; and there are
each year more and more expenses which must be met by the
IC on behalf of the student body with a fixed income.

It is difficult to believe that every penny of next year’s $300
increase in tuition is needed desperately by the university.
Many students have been left incredulous by the increase, and
this incredulousness will remain unless these students can see
a viable application of the added revenue, Such an application
could come in the form of an increase in the student tax.

estimating that about 1650 students will attend the univer-
sity next year, we can see that about half a million dollars will
be added to the school's coffers on the basis of the increase
alone. This does not account for any increase coming from,
say, a larger enrollment.

Half a million for the university, and not one penny for
direct student use. The situation is not all that dire, as cer-
tainly the increase will go toward university expenses either
directly or indirectly affecting the students, But it certainly is
a bit strange when out of all that money, not one penny is
viven to the students for their direct use, particularly when
the students are the ones who are paying the half million.

\ny increase in the tax certainly would not take a large
chunk out of the university's operating budget, but it would
benefit the students directly, The EC would have more money
with which to operate student activities. Why not increase
the student tax proportionately with the increased tuition?
The tuition has increased by one-fourth in the past three
years. Why not raise the student tax by one-fourth to just over
$21 per student? The increase would add over $6500 to the
student body's funds, without taking a really substantial cut
out of the university's revenues as a whole.

We hope the EC manages to win the battle with the ad-
ministration over the question of the student tax. Without an
increase in revenues, next year’s EC will have to mediate
among the various student activities all asking for more
money, and the results could be even less money and possibly
even the curtailment of some of these activities.

Frustrations Of A Pizza Lover

By SKIP PAUKERT

Like any self-respecting college
kid, I love Pizza. In fact, my
weekly pie is one of those few
things which I simply couldn’t
live without; if ever I could mus-
ter the courage to swear off that
Italian ambrosia for Lent, I
wouldn't make it alive to Easter,

Ah, there is nothing to approach
it! A piping hot pie, right from
the oven, is placed down on the
table in front of you. The steam
rises from that amazing concoc-
tion of meat, tomato sauce, and
still-bubbling cheese. And _ then,
you take that first bite—and reach
a gastronomic orgasm as the moz-
zarella clings to the slice des-
parately, long and stringy. .. .

As with any great food, the
quality of pizza varies greatly.
When I was very young I swore
off Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee Frozen piz-
zas: a sure let-down every time.
But then, there are a few accept-
able frozen versions (if you look
hard enough) and box mixes (Ap-
pian Way, for instance) can be
alright in a pinch.

Nevertheless, to get a_ really
fine pie, one almost always has
to go to a restaurant, preferably
one which specializes in this Ital-
ian delight. And likewise, the
quality of the pies varies in such
establishments from the very best
to the very worst.

If vou start with a half-decent
base (light crust, spicy tomato
sauce, good mozzarella) you can
build a truly great pie. Person-

Letters To T

Busted Students Backed
To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi

As the sentencing date for three
Washington and Lee students in-
volved in the drug cases draws
near, we feel that it is necessary
that a few widespread sentiments
among students be expressed,

Since the November drug bust,
many of us have become aware
for the first time of the serious-
ness of distributing drugs—in-
cluding marijuana. Although we
do not agree with the severity of
the possible punishments, we
have, by mere exposure to the
cases, been made fully aware of
the fact that lengthy prison terms
and heavy fines are very real al-
ternatives for the state to impose.

It is our sincere hope that the
Lexington community feels no
need for a precedent to be set, in
the sense of desiring that one or
more students be sent to prison.
The shock of finding our friends
and fellow students suddenly con-
vieted felons has, by itself, had a
most sobering effect on the stu-
dent body, as well as these in-
dividuals themselves. Surely this
community can accept less than
the penitentiary for a smal! group
of unaware students who accom-
modated two ostensible friends
(narcotics agents) in their re-
quest for drugs.

We, the undersigned, do not
condone the activities of the stu.
dents involved. But, as they were
unconscious of the legal serious-
ness of their crimes, we do sup-
port their right to remain among

the normal members of society.
We hope and pray that these
voung men will not have to be-

come warped in a prison cell for
deeds that they only now under-
stand to be so wrong by law.

ally, 'm a food pizza man myself
—the more extra goodies that
can be piled on top, the better.
Why someone would eat a “plain”
cheese pizza has always been in-
scrutable to me—I can feel only
remorse and pity for the poor
fellow, however well-meaning he
may be, who eats a pizza without
imagination or a sense of adven-
ture. To my palate, pepperoni and
mushrooms are a must, with
green pepper, onion, hamburger,
olives, etc. rendering it all the
better.

A Dismal Scene

All of which brings us to the
Pizza scene in Lexington, which,
sorry to say, is dismal at best.
Here we have two great institu-
tions of higher learning with a
combined population of thousands
of hungry boys—and not a single
outstanding pizza parlor in town.

It really is a sad state of affairs,
because what we're missing is
more than just good food. In most
college towns, the pizza parlor is
a center for the community, a
place of fraternity, good times,
good beer, and good grub, The
local pizza parlor is usually the
most aromatic and comfortable
environment on campus. But
here. ...

The College Inn comes Closest
to filling this bill, and pizza is
the most popular item on the
menu. Evidently at one time, Jong
ago, the “CI” was the hangout;

students would be “grossly un-
justified.” Yet there is no reason
on this good earth why their de-
grees cannot be withheld pend-
ing a decision in all cases by the
court. The logie of the SCC on
this point escapes me entirely.
Obviously after all the students
have been convieted, further ac-
tion by the University could be
taken according to the court's de-
cision. As it stands now, however,
the University will have conferr-
ed degrees and recognition § to
three convicted felons without so
much as a word of disapproval.

On the second point, | concur
that there are “degrees of crimi-
nalitv.” But under no. cireum-
stances can | consider the sale of
illegal drugs, whether it be to
little ladies or infants, as “accom-
modating.” The SCC would have
us believe that there are felons
and there are felons and that
there is a_ difference between
them. But | say there is no differ-
ence when the reputation and
honor (as corny as it may sound
to some) of the University is at
stake.

On the third point, it cannot be
denied that the hardships of con-
vieted criminals are great, but |
believed they should have con-
sidered this before breaking the
law and dishonoring the Univer-
sity. Action by the University
should not necessarily be motivat-
ed by a desire to make things
hard for these students, but rath-
er by sincere concern for the
University and its role as an hon-
orable institution of learning.

The SCC also maintains that its
inaction on this matter was jus-
tified since a “severe penaity ap-
pearing in their pre-sentence re-
ports might have an adverse ef-
fect” on the sentencing of the stu-
dents by the court, Withholding
their degrees until all sentences
are handed down could hardly be
considered anything but under-
standable caution on the part of
the University.

The final point is one which
we are expected to take at face
value—that the student body
never Intended for the University
to “feel the need to take action”
if such were brought up
The text of this point is so loosely
worded that | wonder what the
SCC reallyy meant by it, but if it

bold as to doubt the word of the

those faded dusty glossies of for-
mer teams and old Big Band
leaders in the window attest to
former glory for this restaurant.
But now it lacks a certain some-
thing and the pizza itself,
though maybe the best in town,
is still far from a “very good” rat-
ing.

The biggest problem is the
crust, where all good pizzas be-
gin. In Lexington, frozen crusts
are imported by truck—they are
too thick and taste like card-
board. Secondly, the Cl relies on
its staple tomato sauce, which is
a little greasy and not spicy
enough,

The cheese is generally okay
and generously applied, but after
these humble origins, the pizza
really has nowhere to go, The Cl
also lacks a variety of toppings
and combinations; there is no
special “deluxe” pizza on the
menu, and with each added item
costing 35-45 cents, making one
up vourself can be really expen-
sive.

The other place where pizza is
featured prominently on the bill
of fare is Mother's, They do have
a “deluxe” pizza, with an abund-
ance of items, but at $5.00 for a
large (12") pizza, it is way over-
priced, Mother's boasts the same
basic crust and sauce as the Cl,
and slightly higher prices to
boot.

A similar, rather rubbery ver-
sion can be found at the Southern

Inn, but since they are busy mak-
ing Mousaka and other dishes,
you can’t expect a really stellar
pie. The surroundings here, of
course, are nicer, service quite
good... but the pizza just accept-
able.

Lexington is a frustrating place
for those of us who like food on
our pizzas. When you pay an ex-
tra 45 cents for mushrooms, you
don’t want to have them = cut
down the the pepperoni to make
room. Mother's is particularly
guilty of this stinginess with ex-
tra items.

Need For Pride

One can probably sum up the
whole problem in one word:
pride. None of the local restaur-
ants seems to take pride in their
pies, and, as everyone in the piz-
za world knows, care is the most
important ingredient. With care,
a pizza can be a memorable ex-
perience; without it, its simply
another sad _ pie.

Perhaps someday | will return,
an old alumnus, and will find to
my delight that things have really
changed—that a great pizza has
finally arrived in Lexington. But
the present state is too cruel for
any pizza fan to be forced to en-
dure. | would not send my son (or

Honor System Supported

To the editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Mr. Kearney'’s article in’ the
May 9, 1973, Ring-tum Phi raises
two important questions about
the Honor System. First, what is

a concrete expression of the ideal
that the university's purpose is
to promote the search for truth.
Uniess students and professors

a student is given to even petty

we not justly question his de-
dication to honesty and thus his
place at the university?

we do not value the ideal of hon-

Middies roared back, with the
tying goal coming on a shot by

The game started off just as the
Virginia game had the week be-

lead, putting together a pair of
well executed fast breaks with
Dave Bayly and Tom Venier on
the scoring end of the plays.

But the Generals got back in,
mainly through the efforts of
Skip Lichtfuss. At the midway
mark of the opening period, the
Stick avoided several attempted
checks and muscled his way past
three Navy defensemen to score
the Generals opening goal.

After Bill Kordis scored the
first of his four goals to give the
Middies a 3-1 lead, Lichtfuss

struck again, working in almost
the same manner that enabled

him to score his finest goal. When
this one hit the back of the net,
it made the score Navy 3, W&L 2.

Rand’s ‘Fountainhead’

Ends Film Season
(Continued from Page 2)

ight for his values and his work,
without ever compromising,
against the elite parasites and se-
cond-handers of his world who
fear his ability and integrity, and
try to destroy him, Unlike most
contemporary dramas of indivi-
dual struggle, in The Fountain-
head there is the example of a
realistic hero who challenges the
world by fighting to live his life
for his own sake, for his own
values ,never to be the object of
sacrifice by others—and he wins.
The example is given also of those
who would dstroy him, those who
would use him to compensate for
their own worthlessness, and the
woman who worshipped him, but
almost lost him willingly because
she was convinced that no one as
good as he could survive on this
earth.

When you see The Fountain-
head on May 29, the image of
Howard Roark may be a strange
and unfamiliar one in your life.
There are few men like him.
Those few move the world and
give it force. You will recognize
many Ellsworth Toohey’s and
Peter Keating's, particularly with-
in this academic jungle from
which some of us are soon fortun-
enough to escape. What is
crucially important for you is;
Will you see your soul in Roark
or in those who went down try-
ing to destroy him? This film de-
monstrates the alternatives from
which you must select and their
consequences for your life.

those who answered the poll, 127
lived in singles, 99 others in dou-
ble rooms—and only 2 of the stu-
dents in doubles objected to abol-
ishing parietal regulations.

The regular interim period be-

fore each section sets its own
hours in the fall will remain in
effect. It will last, however, only

the first 3 weeks
stead of the first 5. The overall
plan will have a trial period of
one year, after which it will be

THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee University’s Weekly Newspaper

   

Conn e rare?
“ALA Td

 

Vol. LXXII

A well-known director and pro-
ducer, the Episcopal bishop of
Arkansas, and a prominent civic
and cultural leader in Lexington
received honorary degrees from

Washington and Lee University
at commencement exercises
Thursday.

The director is Fielder Cook,

whose television credits include
“The Homecoming,” “The Price”
and “Harvey.” The bishop is Cris-
toph Keller Jr., whose cathedral
became nationally known in the
1960s as a center of racial har-
mony. The Lexington community
leader is Miss Mary Monroe Pe-
nick, well-known in the fields of
music, teaching, conservation and
historic preservation.

The three honorary degrees—
Doctor of Fine Arts degrees to
Cook and Miss Penick, and the
Doctor of Divinity degree to Bish-
op Keller—were conferred during
commencement exercises, at
which undergraduate and law de-
grees were conferred on 419 W&L
students.

The ceremonies took place on
the historic Front Campus. By
long-standing tradition the speak-
er was the university president,
Robert E. R. Huntley. Also offer-
ing brief remarks was the student
body president, Robert O. Bren-
nan.

Cook is a 1947 graduate of
Washington and Lee, and Keller
is a 1939 graduate. Miss Penick is
a graduate of Hollins College and
the Juilliard School of Music.

“The Homecoming,” Cook's
award-winning production first
telecast at Christmastime in 1971,

"Those At Home Do Less’

was the basis for the highly suc-
cessful series “The Waltons.”
Cook directed Arthur Miller’s
“The Price” as well as “Teacher,
Teacher,” the sensitive and illumi-
nating story of a retarded child,
for the Hallmark Hall of Fame
Series.

In addition, he directed the tele-
vision revival of “Harvey” with
James Stewart and Helen Hayes,
also for Hallmark, and the 1966
musical special “Brigadoon.”

Cook was director of the Lux
Television Theatre, TV’s first re-
gularly scheduled dramatic series,
from 1950 to 1953, and from 1953
to 1956 produced and directed 18
programs a year for the Kraft
Television Theatre.

He also directed and produced
regular programs for the duPont
Show of the Week series, the
Philco and Goodyear Playhouses,
and Playhouse 90.

He has received several Emmy
awards, two Directors Guild pla-
ques, and numerous other awards
and nominations.

Mr. Cook is also the director of
seven motion pictures whose stars
include Sir John Gielgud, Ingrid
Bergman, Dame Edith Evans,
David Niven, Deborah Kerr, Jason
Robards and others.

He is a member of the board
of governors of the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences as
well as vice president and board
member of the Directors Guild
of America.

City, Mich., initially entered busi-
ness after graduation from W&L
and service with the U.S. Marine

Why Spring Term?

By JESS REKVES

it sounds like more and more
people are asking “what is wrong
with Spring Term?” The past aca-
demic year marked W&L’s third
with its new curriculum
and calandar, A lot of people on
the ‘Hill’ still do not like some of
the changes that have been made
in the academic framework and
most of those never did, but it
would seem that the ranks of the
discontented are swelling.

The origins of Spring Term and
the new calendar go back to Dr.
Pusey's year as acting President
of the University. In 1966 he ap-
pointed a ten member faculty
committee to study the curricu-
lum of Washington and Lee. The
first chairman of the committee
was Dr. Roberts of the Biology
Department. Dr. Spencer led the
group through a second year of
study and Dr. DeVogt saw the
third vear of this committee end
with the acceptance of their pro-
posals on changes that should be
made in the curriculum

season

Iipiscopal Bishop Christoph

The committee was then allowed
to die its natural death, having
reorganized the curriculum, re-
quirements, organization and cal-
endar of the school.

After two years under the pre-
sent system President Huntley
decided that the committee should
be reinstituted to evaluate the
progress being made under the
new curriculum, The study group
was comprised of basically the
same group as the first time
around: Dr. Jarrett, Dr. Phillips,
Dr. Thompson, Dr, Buchanan, Dr.
Hodges, Mr. Stevenson, Dr. Du-
vall, Dr. Roberts, Dr. Spencer. The
chairman was still Dr. DeVogt.
The report of this group to the
President consisted primarily of
the results of a faculty poll on
the new curriculum,

Response to the questionnaire
submitted to President Huntley
during the last Winter Term was,
if anyhing, better than was expec-
ed, The changes in the curriculum
instituted in the past few years

Keller

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, MAY 31, 1973

Director of TV, Bishop,
Civic Leader Honored

Corps during World War II,

In 1955, however, he resigned
from his positions as executive
vice president of Murphy Oil Co.
and president of Deltic Farm &
Timber Co. to answer a late call
to the ministry. He received his
vocational education at General
Theological Seminary in New
York and at the graduate school of
the University of the South. He
holds honorary degrees from both
institutions.

Ordained a priest in 1957, Mr.
Keller took his wife and six chil-
dren to the Ozark Mountains of
Arkansas, where he ministered to
three mission congregations.

In 1962 he was called to St.
Andrew's Cathedral in Jackson,
Miss. During his pastorate there
the church served as a reconcil-
ing influence in the community,
becoming nationally prominent
when participants in a so-called
“kneel in” were welcomed for the
first time in a Mississippi church.

He was elected bishop coadjutor
of the Diocese of Arkansas in
1967, and three years later he suc-
ceeded Bishop Robert R, Brown
as diocesan.

He serves on the board of theo-
logical education of the Episcopal
Chureh and on the governing
boards of the University of the
South (Sewanee), General Theo-
logical Seminary, and Al! Saints’
Episcopal School. He has also
been a trustee of Sweet Briar Col-
lege and Kent School.

Miss Penick has been organist
and music director at the Lexing-
ton Presbyterian Church since
1931. From 1940 until 1962 she
was supervisor of music in the
Lexington public school system,
and from 1951 to 1956 served on
the Hollins College board of trus-
tees.

In addition to Hollins and Juil-
liard, she has studied music at
Northwestern, Columbia and Yale
Universities, and in 1960 spent a
vear in France studying organ
and conducting under Nadia Bou-

langer.
In 1945 Miss Penick founded
the Rockbridge Concert-Theatre

Series, Lexington’s community
concert organization, on whose
board she continues to serve.

She holds two Algernon Sydney
Sullivan medals—one from Wash-

ington and Lee (1948) and one
from Hollins (1960). The award
recognizes excellence “in high

ideals of living, in spiritual quali.
tiles, and in generous and disinter-
ested service to others.”

Her father, Paul MecNee!l Pe
nick, Was a trustee of Washing

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

   

OUTLOOK and REVIEW,
A Welcome To Freshmen

There are usually three purposes in printing an end-ol-the-
year edition of the Ring-tum Phi to mail to all incoming
freshmen: to let our advertisers wecome you to Washington
and Lee, to welcome you ourselves, and to offer a few words of
advice to the novice university man.

The first purpose can be seen as fulfilled by just paging
through the rest of this paper and noting all the space devoted
to advertising. The second purpose is easy enough to fulfill in
this editorial—we welcome you to Washington and Lee and
hope that you enjoy your stay here.

But it is the third purpose—to offer some advice —which
cannot be so easily fulfilled, It is difficult to try to be specific
in doling out little items of advice that will help the entire
incoming freshman class. But a few generalizations can be
made to at least help the typical freshman get into the academ-
ic and social swing of things.

Upon first arriving here in September, you will all be sub-
jected to that little week-long festivity known as orientation,
The Class of 1977 will be taken into the wild jungles of Na-
tural Bridge, where it will find little else to do other than
listen to the endless cavaleade of speeches about an equally
endless cavalcade of subjects.

There will be an almost irrestible urge in each freshman,
after about the first speech, to skip out on the rest of the
activities and spend his time more wisely sleeping in his
room. But believe it or not, all those speeches you hear do
have a purpose. Whether on the academic grandeur of the
school, or on its troubled Honor System, each speech, if fol-
lowed with a reasonable attentiveness, will aid the freshman in
his four years here, And be sure to remember any questions
which the speeches may raise in your mind, as the freshmen
dormitory counselors will be at Natural Bridge to answer any
questions and to perhaps give an insight into what to watch
out for at the university.

The Honor System will be the most important subject dis-
cussed at the orientation program. Many people believe that
\W&L’s present Honor System is dying. What next year's
student body government, the Executive Committee, will be
doing at orientation is to revitalize the Honor System in the
minds of the students at Washington and Lee. The Honor
System is still one of the most distinctive traits of this univer-
sity, and its effect wll still be far-reachng, as you will see
when someday a fellow student wll be asked to leave the uni-
versity after being convicted of an Honor Code violation.

\nother W&L institution besides orientation which you
will have to face is Rush. Although fraternties have been fad-
ing away slowly in relation to their social value to the univer-
sity, they are still an important part of W&L student life, as
about 60% of students are in fraternities.

Participating in Rush is an experience to be recommended
to each freshman. Even if you are not planning to join a frater-
nity, Rush still provides an excellent opportunity to meet
some upperclassmen and to get an idea of the social animal at
W&L. But be sure to view the world of fraternities as ob-
jectively as possible, keeping in mind the expanding role of
independent life at the university. Be sure to talk to some in-
dependents as well as to the fraternity boys, for a biased
opinion from both sides is better than a biased opinion from
only one side.

These little bits of advice will hopefully help to pull you
through the first few weeks here next fall untill you are able
to stand up for yourself and face each new deluge which you
will find constantly pounding you. Until then, we look for-
ward to seeing you in the fall and we hope these few prelimi-
nary words will be helpful to you in your first few days at
W&L.

Wanted: More Staff Members

Just for the record, you are most likely looking at the last
issue of the Ring-tum Phi to be printed in this general format.
Vlans are as yet incomplete, but we are anticipating major
change in this newspaper.

In recent years, the Phi has been experiencing the nation-
wide campus problem of student apathy, Interest in the paper,
both in reading it and in working for it, has declined sharply
in the last four years. In an attempt to counter this decline, we
of next year's staff will be trying to make the paper draw in-
terest from the student body,

To do that, we will need a large and competent staff. And
we cordially invite you to stop by the Phi office in Reid Hall if
vou feel you can be of service, The need for a newspaper like
the Phi at Washington and Lee is great, but the need for a
competent staff to put out an excellent paper at WA&L is even
greater.

THE RING-TUM PHI

The Ring-tum Phi is published on Wednesdays during the college year,
li is printed by the Journalism Laboratory Press, Washington and Lee
University. The mailing address is Box 899, Lexington, Virginia 24450
Entered as second class matter September 29, 1946, at the Post Office,
Lexington, Virginia 24450, under the act of March 3, 1879. Subscription
rates: $6.00 for the school year, $3.00 for the semester.

Husine Manager

Perhaps the first thing an in-
coming freshman would want to
know, arriving in a strange town
at an unfamiliar campus, is where
to purehase things—supplies,
books, furniture, clothes, etc.

WEL students, by and large,
maintain a good relationship with
the Lexington merchants. Most
restaurants and stores will take
student checks with no question.
Most of the clothing stores have
charge accounts which will allow
to send the bills home to Dad.

The campus center for mer-
chandise is, of course, the Uni-
versity Co-op. In this rather small
building, between the library and
the freshman dormitories, there
is a snack bar, bookstore, text-
book store, and a record store.
The snack bar and textbook sec-
tion are run by Mr. James Tolar
—and the Co-op is probably the
most popular spot in town for
students to eat breakfast and
lunch. Their prices are reasonable
(10 cent Cokes and 25 cent hot
dogs still survive here!) and it's
a central place for students to
meet. The Coop carries a com-
plete line of notebooks and sta-
tionery supplies, greeting cards,
Wé&L clothing and gifts, as well
as food,

Adjoining the snack bar is Betty
Munger’s Bookstere, Mrs. Mun-
ger's operation is distinct from
the textbook division, and is com-
prised of mostly paperback books.
Mrs. Munger selects her titles
with the student and faculty
ellentie in mind, and her store has
impressed many a campus visi-
tor. It is rare that a visiting poet,
scholar, or lecturer leaves W&L
before stocking up on books from
her shelves.

Dowentairs, the textbooks and
the record store are located. The

Co-op selis both new and used
editions of booke for all W&L
courses, so students have a choice

in price. The Co-op also buys back
used textbooks from students for
resale,

Rieh Johnson's
among the textbooks, is perhaps
the most sticceseful of the lot. He
has put one major record shop in

Fast is east and West is west
and never the twain shall meet?
No longer. What we have here is
basically a quartet, made up of
English horn, bass, tabla & sitar,
and guitar. Not just those, instru-
ments, though; piano, violin, flute,
and others, mostly percussion, are
also included at one time or an-
other.

This is really a panoramic al-
bum, in the sense that Debussv's
orchestral musie tended to be
panoramic, as compared to Bee-
thoven's, which was merely ma-
jJestic. The lyrical softness which

far more refined than their ear-

to be unrefined; other albums
along the same line are fearus,

All three are highly recommend-

Of course, Towner and MeCand-
less don't do it by themselves.
They are, though, most of the
Western sound, for Colin Wal-
cott's sitar and tabla work is de-
finitely Indian-oriented. This is

Birch Society ‘Sans’ Mellhany;
Where Does It Go From Here?

By DOUG BURTON

“We don't want anyone to join
the John Birch Society who isn't
going to be a Bireher with a
capital B.” the voung man said
deftly rolling up the cord to the
slide projector.

Freshman Bill Mellhany had
given his first J.4.5. film atrip
on this campus in September of
1960, It was the firet of many
film strips that Melihany and co-
workers Jack Whipple and Wil-
liam Merrill would show during
their four years at thie Univer:
nity

\il three graduated this May,
leaving behind them a tradition
of Hireher activiem that the four
remaining dues paving members
will be hard pressed to continue

Mclihany was by far the lou
dest voice. Speaking in Lee Cha
pel on Moratorium day in Oete
ber 1960, Melihany was quoted by
the HRingtum Phi as saving “the

eountry’s troubles in the (Viet
pain ) war were ceaipaal hy a
Conspiracy between the United

States and the US.S.R.” He call-
ed then for a halt to the “con-
stant flow of aid and comfort to
our enemies.”

It was strange talk at a time
when campus activism Was on
the upswing. Harvard students
were on strike. A few months be-
fore student ad hee committees
had taken to the barricades,
in paris, Rome, and Berlin,
everywhere calling for a new
Marxist revolution. It was atill
chic to be radical, and Herbert
Marcuse Was enjoying unpre.
cedented popularity,

tut Melihany wae then laying
what he hoped would become the
groundwork for @ vigorous coun
terattack, That counterattack has
resulted in few conversions but
has indueed many radicals and
eonservatives alike to rethink
their positions

it is not unfair to say that Me
Ithany was himeelf a radical, for
he was as much a eritie of “the

not surprising, though; Walcott
was one of Ravi Shankar's first
Western students for sitar, and
Alla Rakha’s for tabla. The tabla,
rather like a bongo in size only,
provides a much more versatile
rvhthm base for the musie than
traps could, merely by virtue of
the different pitches of the drums
within the set. As he did with
Winter, Walcott uses a variety of
pereussion to “fill out” the round-
ness of his sound. Percussion is
much more than the thump-
thump-thump of so much other
musie around these days.

This is another one of those al-
bums which is at home wherever
you take it.

Firesign Thatre is not dead;

The two studio maniacs, Philip

now come out with this “video

one of the most successful in
W&L’'s history, with the 11 var-

Some faculty members feel that

ho wishes that the Spring Term

ment. His basic reaction is that
“Spring is the wrong time to start

omething new!”

Seniors, especially, do not want
to start a new term six weeks be-

Term is not being utilized effec-

ward to the Spring Term as one
would forward to a three
week vacation in Maine; not too
exciting or terribly stimulating,
but a nice, relaxing way to waste
some time, In the faculty ques-
tionnaire instructors were asked
to evaluate any programs in their
respective departments which
were unique to the Spring Term.
Thirty percent replied that they
had not participated in any such

As one member of the faculty
commented on his questionnaire;
“The worst thing about this six
weeks is that students feel con-
fident they can do less. Six weeks
term is of value to those who
study abroad. Those at home do
less.” The conditions which give
rise to this attitude must be nip-
ped in the bud by changing our
approach to the Spring Term, or
it might as well be shelved until
the W&L community can handle
