Virginia cracks
down on minors

State tougherzs penalties for
underage alcohol possession

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS armor:

Students across Virginia
who drink underage face a new
penalty this school year: the
mandatory loss of their driver’s
license for at least six months.

The Virginia state legislature
beefed up underage drinking
laws last February after Del-
egate Brian Moran, D-Alexan-
dria, introduced a pair of bills in
the Virginia Legislature.

One bill makes it illegal
for adults to serve alcohol to
minors who are guests in their
homes.

The other bill, which passed
unanimously in the State Senate
and by an 88-10 margin in the
House of Delegates, mandates
a six-month loss of a minor’s
driver’s license if the person is
convicted of possession or con-
sumption of alcohol.

Along with the suspension
of license, the minor also faces
a mandatory $500 ﬁne or 50
hours of community service.

The bill passed the state sen— ,

ate on Feb. 28 but only recently
came to the attention of univer-
sity oﬂicials across Virginia.

“We found out after the
law passed,” Dean of Students
Dawn Watkins said. “It hit ad-
ministrators around the state by
surprise.”

Watkins also said Washing-
ton and Lee’s legal counsel, Le-
anne M. Shank, did not know
the law was under consideration
until after it had been passed.

Dean Watkins and Matt
Krieg, Chairman of the Student
Judicial Council, sent a letter to
all students and parents inform-

ing them of the new laws.

In their letter, Watkins and
Krieg noted that if the new laws
had been in place last year, 15
students could have faced the
loss of their driver’s license.

Michael Young, W&L’s Di-
rector of Campus Security, said
his department, along with Wat-
kins and Krieg, has told every-
one they can possibly tell.

“Word has gotten out,”
Young said. “The freshmen
have been told two or three
times at least that it’s illegal to
drink underage.”

Since Virginia’s new law is
stricter than the minor-in-pos-
session laws of most states,
Young said some confusion
exists over what will happen if
out-of-state students have their
licenses suspended.

“Some states have reciprocal
agreements and might suspend
your license at home, but other
states might not acknowledge
Virginia’s suspension. Either
way you still won’t be allowed
to drive in Virginia.”

Young said the state “wants
to indicate they are getting
tough on underage drinking,”

Lexington Police Chief
Steve Crowder agreed with
Young’s assertion.

“My understanding was that
so much underage drinking
was going on that the penalties
weren’t stiff enough,” Crowder
said.

“I have a 17-year-old son
and when I told him about
the new laws, he said that this
would deﬁnitely get kid’s atten-
tion.”

Crowder said that he is not
sure if the penalties will stop

He also said that the new laws
will not cause the police depart-
ment to increase, decrease or in
any way change the way they
patrol.

Crowder did say that under-
age possession citations have
become more common.

“We had three in August of

2006 versus zero in August of
2005. In all of 2004 there were
three and in all of 2005 there
were four, so we had as many
last month as we had in the en-
tire year of 2004.”

In 2005, local law enforce-
ment officers issued 59 cita-
tions for liqour law violations.
The number of violations in

.§-—'

2004 was 38.

Though ‘Virginia legislators
hope to cut down on underage
drinking, Watkins said she was
not sure if this law was the way
to solve that problem.

“I’m not sure ifthis is a pos-
itive step; it seems like a regres-
sive move to me.”

T hirr/CF ast and PlayF air draw mixed reviews from freshmen

By Cody Beauchamp
STAFF WRITER

A small group of freshman
confronted dorm counselors and
residential life staff when they
tried to walk outnof an orientation
event Monday night.

The students were trying to
leave the trivia game “Thinkfast,”
held at Lenfest.

Head dorm counselor Sam
Wilmoth said, “I think that some
of the [dorm counselors] were
a little confused and hurt by the
way they were treated by those
students.”

Wilmoth said that the students’
actions can be explained by the
stress of being in a new place.
He said that the problems may be

caused by the adjustment to a new
environment and having to meet
so many new people. “It’s easy to
fall back on becoming sarcastic
and getting an attitude,” he said.

He said that the staff was
caught off guard by how quickly
those feelings manifested in the
students concerned.

“The actions of those few indi-
viduals at ThinkFast just weren’t
in keeping with the high standards
of civility we hold ourselves to,
and to be yelled at and ignored by
those individuals caught some of
us off guard,” Wilmoth said.

One of the more prevalent
complaints from students was
that many failed to understand
how some of the activities ﬁt their
ideas of what orientation week

should be.

“O-week is all about meeting
people,” said freshman Diana
Cianciotta, but pointed out that
the “ThinkFast” activity hindered
that.

“I think that out of all the
events, only “PlayFair” did that. It
was corny, but pretty effective.”

A freshman, who wished to re-
main anonymous to avoid further
conﬂict, agreed that PlayF air was
most effective. “It was a better
get-to-know-you event than any
of the others,” the student said,
but added, “I felt like we were be-
ing sort of talked dovm to.”

“It was ridiculously difﬁcult
to meet people,” Ciancotta said.
“The music was so loud that it
was tough to understand what the

person next to you was saying, let
alone meet them.”

Dean David Leonard said,
“Orientation is not simply de-
signed for new students to meet
one another. It is also an opportu-
nity to introduce new community
members to the academic and co-
curricular aspects of the Univer-
sity.”

One freshman was particularly
peeved that some of the dorm
counselors were competing for a
share of the $200 cash prize for
the event.

“It’s supposed to be a freshman
event, and it’s mandatory, but we
can’t even compete amongst our-
selves for the prizes?” the student
said. “We have to compete with
these upperclassmen who’ve
done it before? Explain to me
how that’s right.”

The walkout have

may

David Leonard said. “Unfor-

tunately, the event didn’t start_

promptly and should have con-
cluded 15 minutes earlier.” He
said that a "timely start would have
helped avoid conﬂict.

At some events, Leonard said,
“it was evident that some mem-
bers of the class were tired, disen-
gaged, and wanting to go party.”

Leonard said that although the
social scene is “both important
and enjoyable,” it is important to
reiterate the primary reasons for
going to college in the ﬁrst place.

When discussing what they
liked about the week’s events,
several students regarded the
Tuesday night discussion on race
and diversity as “very interest-
ing,” and “compelling.”

national
awards

W&L is online
Rockbridge Report
named runner—up

By Melissa Caron
oesrcn nmscron

This summer the “Rockbridge
Report” was named one of the top
three online student newspapers
in the country by the Society of
Professional Journalists.

The publication, which is pro-
duced weekly by classes within
the journalism department dur-
ing fall and winter term, was
awarded the “Mark of Excellence
Award,” for the work students did
in 2005. ‘

Professor Doug Cumming,
who teaches the Reporting for
Print Media class, related that this

award was a true testament to the .

success of the online publication.

“There is a difference between
awards given to journalists by
journalists and marketplace suc-
cess,” Cumming said. “You wish
they were the same thing.”

The “Rockbridge Report,”
covers news within Lexington
and Rockbridge County. While it
is produced by students, the gen-
eral audience of the publicationis
the surrounding community.

Journalism Professor Clau- i

dette Artwick teaches two of the
classes responsible for the pro-
duction of the publication.

“I don’t know that we have
lots of student exposure and inter-
est,” Artwick said. “People in the
community are really what we’re
aimed at.”

Cumming points out that the
real intention of the “Rockbridge
Report” is not increased reader-
ship but rather education, and lit-
tle has been done to promote the
publication.

“This is real news, covering
Rockbridge County,” Cumming
said. “At the same time our pur-
pose is education.”

Several other classes, such as

with near universal praise. “Burr
Datz is the coolest guy alive,”
asserted ‘one freshman after the
program.

Some found the program’s
closing song “I Got Drunk (and I
Missed It)” to be ironically hip.

(Much to the dismay of this
reporter, it is a Burr Datz original,
and is thus not on iTunes ~ yet.)

Overall, despite the one disso- -

nant event at “Thinkfast,” wide-
spread approval seemed to be the
norm.
Wilmoth said, “There will al-
ways be mistakes and problems,
but I think to just look at those
who messed up and to transpose
those incidents over the entire
class would be a mistake.”

One anonymous freshman

agreed. “l’ve had the time of my ’ -

life this week,” the student said.
“lt’s awesome.”

Old Co-Op begins new
life as faculty ofﬁces

Six-million dollar project aimed at relieving oﬂice space crunch

By Wesley 0’Dell
STAFF WRITER

Students returning to W&L
after a summer hiatus were sur-
prised to ﬁnd their beautiful cam-
pus tumed into a construction
zone.

The area between the Graham-
Lees courtyard and Huntley Hall
looked especially different. The
old Co-Op building is undergoing
a nearly-$6 million makeover.

According to Joseph Grasso,
Vice President for Administration,
the 95-year-old structure is being
completely gutted and renovated
to create additional ofﬁce space.
This is in response to the recent
faculty expansion that left many
new hires without an ofﬁce close
to their classrooms.

Vice President Grasso says the
project, which began on the day
after graduation, will create 22
new offices for faculty of both the
Williams School and the College,
some of whom have been forced
to work out of the Early-Fielding
building.

Constructed in 1911, the old
Co-Op is a place of fond memo-
ries for many alumni.

The fact that the Co-Op is be-
ing remodeled to continue serving
the campus is, according to Gras-
so, an example of the “history of
W&L and the value the buildings
have in maintaining the character
of the campus.”

The construction has been
characterized as “mildly dis-
ruptive” by some freshmen in
Graham-Lees, who complain of
noise throughout the day. Others
reported that the work caused no
disruption to their day.

The old Co-op, originally
built in 1911, gets a little
re-vamping this year.

The project’s completion is
slated for July 2007. In addition
to the remodeling of the build-
ing itself by Glavé and Holmes, a
Richmond ﬁrm which specializes
in academic buildings, a land-
scape architect will be brought
in this summer to redesign the
grounds around Huntley Hall.

In the interim, the University
will be putting down sod at the
end of September to spruce up the
area.

Although the production of a
television news channel has been
a part of the department since the
1970s, the web version was not

and realized this was the direction
it was moving it,” Artwick said.

with the skills they’ve learning.
Combining resources can be won-
derful but it’s also stressful.”

The Society of Professional
Journalists is a not-for-proﬁt or-
ganization that is dedicated to
upholding freedom of press and
ethics amongst publications na-
tionally.

“The recognition by the SPJ
is an indication we’re doing our
job,” Artwick said.

The road to gaining national
recognition began last year when
the department sent in copies of
the online publication. From here
the “Rockbridge Report” was
judged against other publications
from its region.

The SPJ separates the na-
tion,.\into twelve regions by state.
Washington and Lee resides in re-
gion two and w\asup a ainst other
colleges from VirgirY1a,gi/Iaryland,
North Carolina, Delaware, and
the District of Columbia.

Last spring at the SPJ’s region-
al conference the “Rockbridge
Report” was awarded ﬁrst place
in its region. From here it was
judged against all other ﬁrst place
publications from each region and
was eventually named one of the
two national ﬁnalists at the SPJ
Convention and National Journal-
ism Conference held in Chicago
this summer.

First place was taken by “The
Lantern Online,” which is pro-
duced by students at Ohio State
University. The Rockbridge Re-
port,” shared the ﬁnalist position
with “The Independent Florida
Alligator,” from the University of
Florida. Publications were judged
based upon several criteria, in-
cluding accuracy, ingenuity, cre-
ativity, and adherence to the SPJ ’s
code of ethics.

When the students of two re-
porting classes responsible for
the “Rockbridge Report” met this
fall, they sat around a long con-
ference table. There were only
seven of them, normal for this

usually small class. It was a lab
day, so the two classes were being
held together. .
In the classroom students use
a textbook and discuss general is-
sues about newspaper production.
Students are then able to take this
theoretical and academic side and
apply it to their work during lab.
Cumming and Professor Rob-
ert deMaria, who teaches the Re-
porting for Electronic Media, sat
with students at the table, much as
if this were an actual meeting for
a professional newsroom. Cum-
ming suggested that everyone go
around and introduce themselves

and tell what they did over the
summer. Student resumes proved
impressive as most went on to de-
scribe internships they had held
over the summer, ranging from
jobs held at Reuters and Bloom-
berg to writing for local newspa-
pers.

“We’ve got» some high pow-
ered people in here. This is great,”
Cumming said, growing more
enthusiastic as the conversation
moved around the table.

“We’re going to cook here!
We’re going to cover Rockbridge
County like it’s never been cov-
ered.”

The book-buying routine used

there are few.
Some stu-

dents sell used books over Cam-
pus Notices. From last year to this
year, the number of notices sell-
ing textbooks has tripled. They
all offer books at cheaper prices
than the campus bookstore.
Online sites have also become
more popular. They allow stu-
dents to comparison-shop for spe-
ciﬁc textbooks and ﬁnd cheaper
versions of the book in earlier
editions or paperback.
In a 2006 study commis-
sioned by the Virginia General

' Assembly, students who shopped

for textbooks online saved a mini-
mum of 20 to 40 percent.

Web sites like Amazon.com
tack on additional discounts dur-
ing peak seasons in August and
December.

Still, according to the study,
over 77 percent of students at-
tending Virginia colleges shop
exclusively at their university’s
bookstore, usually because book
lists for their courses were not
available elsewhere.

Last year, Virginia21, a youth-_
oriented action group, stepped in:
The group successfully lobbied
to make book-buying more af-
fordable and end the monopolies’
bookstores hold on most campus-
es. Last summer, the Textbook

place.

Public colleges in Virginia
now have to post book lists as
soon as professors submit them.
They must be in a visible place
and available to students well be-

of Higher Education reports 17
other states have enacted similar
legislation.

As a private institution, W&L
is not subject to the act. For stu-
dents to ﬁnd book lists, they must
work for them.

That was Allison Rogers’ plan.

needed to buy. Some responded;
some did not.

“So it was easier to go to the
bookstore and buy there,” said
Rogers, after her failed attempts,
“even though I hate how expen-
sive it is.”

The State Council for Higher
Education reports a quarter of stu-
dents spend over $1,000 on text-
books each year. Average costs
are about $400 each semester, and
the council predicts prices are on
the rise.

Washington and Lee students

BRANDON DOTSON, Assoclate Dean of Students

Riviere is excited to ﬁnd a simi-
lar university that allows him to
pursue both of his professional
passions—teaching and research.
Although he expresses his excite-
ment for getting to know students
as the year progresses, he has, so
far, been most impressed with his
colleagues.

“They are all extremely smart,
and good at what they do. But
they’re also great to hang out with
and just grab a cup of coffee.”

Along with assisting the
university’s numerous pre-med
students, he hopes to increase
interest in research careers for
W&L students in science majors.
The university has committed to
expanding faculty in several de-
partments.

straying from the speaking tradition

Three ways W&L students try to avoid talking with strangers and students they meet on the street

Members of the W&L community have been

decrying the supposed demise of the speaking

tradition for decades, but Grace Andrew has

noticed that today’s students employ some sly

tricks to subtly escape the tradition of talking.

By Grace Andrews
c o L u M N I sr

“Hey,” “How are you?” “Hel-
10,” ‘‘What’s up?”

These are a few of the ways
that many faculty and students
greet one another, or at least are
supposed to.

Today’s topic is the speaking
tradition here at Washington and
Lee. Our
speak-
ing tradi-
tion is the
stuff of
legends:
the notion
that ev-
eryone on
this cam-
pus will
speak to anyone they see regard-
less of familiarity.

Disappointingly, this is not
always the case. There are ‘some
of us here in the W&L commu-
nity who participate a little more
actively than others, so much so
that I have created my own list of
“avoidance” techniques and how
they are used.

Before I begin, I must warn the
readers: you may identify these as
actions that you do on a daily ba-
sis. My goal is not to offend, only
to create awareness. If you are

offended, you know why. Since
I cannot speak for others, I will
only use my experiences to illus-
trate the lack of “speaking” that I
have sometimes encountered.

The ﬁrst technique is the
“Watch My Every Step.” This
technique usually begins from
about 200 yards away, when the
person realizes that you are walk-
ing in their direction and begins
to strangely look down.

It may seem to the untrained
eye that this person is one of the
most discreet and ambiguous
mammals on the campus, other-
wise known as the shy or quiet
kid.

The truth is that this person is
now watching their footwork so
meticulously that one would think
that an intense game of “Step on
a Crack, Break your Mother’s
Back” was being played, in

.— which if they stepped on a crack. 4

their mom would mysteriously
turn into a female version of Qua-
simodo.

In reality, the Foot Watcher is
just avoiding greeting you, and
what ever the reason you are left
smiling and greeting the lovely
scalp of some random stranger.
Let’s just hope they’re not suffer-
ing from male pattern baldness or
a severe case of dandruff.

The next technique is the “Cell

Phone.” I really love this one, es-
pecially because of the hilarity I
see in this avoidance method. The
“Cell Phone” usually begins at
about a 100 yards from you.

The Cell Phone Poser will
pretend that their cell phone is
ringing, vibrating or sending dog
whistle like sound waves to their
car, especially since no one else
seems to hear the ring or see any
kind of vibrations.

The Cell Phone Poser will then
proceed with a fake conversation,
usually with their “Mother” or be-
loved “Granny.” Lord knows that
the only person they’re talking to
is themselves or their imaginary
friends, or maybe the voices in
their head are ﬁnally talking back.
If they don’t pretend to “talk,” the
Cell Phone Poser will pretend to
be actually making a call. That part
kills me because of the amount of
numbers they decide to dial. Most
numbers are seven digits, ten if
the area code is included. So, to
see someone literally punch about
twenty-ﬁve different keys makes
me suspicious.

Now, if they aren’t using a
calling card and calling a foreign
country, there is absolutely no
reason to be pressing every num-
ber combo known to the human
race.

*This:technique is probably the*»
hardest to, pull of since the Cell
Phone Poser forgets to even turn
on their phone at times.

I mean, seriously. When was
the last time you saw a solar pow-
ered phone? That’s right: never!
It’s not cute when I walk by and
see that the little power light isn’t
even on.

Last but not least is the most
common of techniques: darty
eyes. The Eye Darter will usually

be able to see you from a variety
of distances.

Upon making initial eye con-
tact, they will then begin to look
all over the place, as if they were
reenacting a Stevie Wonder per-
formance, or they might even do
the “straight-ahead.”

When this happens, the Eye
Darter just looks straight ahead,
avoiding your glance and dis-
abling their peripheral vision un-
til they get past you and start to
“magically” regain their vision
and greet the people they know
directly behind you. This recent-
ly happened to me, I know, me of
all people! I’m just kidding.

I really did encounter an Eye
Darter, whose darting eyes hurt
my feelings and made me wonder
about the state of our speaking
tradition.

Here’s the story: As a friend and
I walked toward the school from
the direction of Sweet Things,
we saw a young man walking to-
wards us. At this time, we were
about 100 yards from him. All of
a sudden he got really jittery and
started to look up and down really
quickly and awkwardly with big
giant head motions.

I got really confused and real-
ized that he was trying to avoid
speaking to us. Being the type A

“personality*that' I am; I" greeted“

him with a simple “hello,” and my
friend with a “hey.” The young
man mumbled something that
may have been somewhere in the
family of hello and then walked
away so quickly you would have
thought he was an Olympic speed
walker.

I mean, honestly, this boy’s eyes
were darting up and and down so
quickly you would have thought
that I had just asked him to be my

The Cell Phone Poser will then proceed
with a fake conversation, usually with
their “Mother” or beloved “Granny. ”
Lord knows that the only person they ’re
talking to is themselves or their imagi-
nary friends, or maybe the voices in their
head are ﬁnally talking back.

baby’s daddy and pay child sup-
port in the ﬁve digit range. It was
really strange and my friend and
I were extremely hurt, confused,
and a bit offended. We couldn’t
ﬁgure out why this guy had acted
so strangely. I would like to say
it was because he had never seen
creatures as lovely as us, but the
truth is we don’t know why. The
manner in which he acted and
mumbled hello was so offensive,
he would have been better olf not
saying anything at all.

But no matter the reason, all
of these techniques and the other
ones that are out there are abso-
lutely urmecessary. So what if you
are shy or get nervous around new
people? All you have to do is say
ﬁelron. . . . .-.. . _.

No one is telling you to stop
a person and get their life story,
complete with baby pictures and
ﬁrst kiss stories. It’s not that criti-
cal. But from some of these tech-
niques, you would really think
that people were going to ask you
to put your ﬁrst born child into the
creek and ﬂoat them to the law
school or something.

Something as simple as say-
ing “Hi” shouldn’t make anyone

break out into convulsions and
nervous ﬁts, and that’s simply the
truth of the matter. Speaking is a
polite and simple way to improve
someone’s day and even your
own.

Some of you may be wonder-
ing what the point of this article
was since all I seem to be doing
is criticizing.

BUT, I criticize to make a
point. Let me put it this way, if the
speaking tradition were an animal,
it would be an endangered species
on the verge of extinction.

Maybe we would even call
it Speakenus Traditionalus (that
would be the Latin name, of
course) and it would be one of
ten still left on the planet with
its ecosystem being cut down for
lumber.

Sounds pretty grim, doesn’t
it?

As funny as that may sound, if
we the W&L community are not
careful, the Speaking Tradition of
this institution will become a side
note of the past.

Just another “good ‘ol days”
memory that your children will
never have the honor or pleasure
to experience or understand.

Bush and the

  prison of secrets

What Voldemort taught George Bush about torture

By Dylan Merrlll
c o L u M N I sr

Don’t get me wrong, I love
prisons. How could you not ap-
preciate such a cultural conver-
gence of nonconforrnists and free
thinkers?

These prisoners are only try-
ing to compensate for their past
mistakes, and maybe make a few
license plates in the process. Un-
fortunately, however, the era of
color-coordinated gang members
and candy-dispensing drug deal-
ers has gone by the wayside.

Last Wednesday, President
Bush announced the existence of
several secret CIA prisons across
Europe facilitate the interrogation
of terrorism suspects (most assur-
edly in a lawful manner).

In order to save face, Bush
also made public that some of
these secret suspects are being
transferred out of the clandestine
facilities.

The suspects should take com-
fort in knowing that they will get
a change of venue. Prisoners can
go from their European getaways
to the tropical Guantanamo Bay
Penitentiary - where inmates are
illegally held. Nice upgrade.

Unfortunately for the transfer-
ees, the Supreme Court recently
condemned the federal prisons’
practice of “altemative” methods
of extracting infomration from
unhelpful suspects, particularly

the use of extreme temperatures
and “waterboarding,” which is
used to make prisoners believe
they are drowning.

I’m sure the new inmates will
feel cheated when they arrive in
Cuba, only to be denied the fun in
the sun and exciting water sports
that such a beautiful island of-
fers.

The Bush administration has
not disclosed the locations of the
secret prisons, nor has it pledged
to no longer make use of the Nazi-
esque facilities.

Now, we cannot even have
the privilege of ﬁnding these un-
lawful institutions on our globes.
Where are they? Prague? The
Rhine Valley? Auschwitz?

The international commu-
nity has condemned these under-
ground interrogation facilities.
Even American allies have spoken
out. Last week, German Chancel-
lor Angela Merkel, who has been
desperately trying to strengthen
the relationship between the
two nations, criticized the Bush
administration, saying that the
government is “calling our funda-
mental beliefs into question.”

Hmm... the German chancel-
lor is wary of Gestapo tactics and
Secret Police interrogations... I

‘guess we can take some comfort

in knowing that one of the major
world powers can learn from his-
tory.

Alas, this all seems like a Har-

ry Potter novel gone awry. Har-
ry (the Secret Prisoner) is taken
from captivity at the Dursley’s
(Secret Prison X) by Hermione
and Ron (the CIA) and trans-
ported via the Hogwarts Express
(high-capacity cargo aircraft)
to Hogwarts (Guantanamo
Bay), only to ﬁnd the uniform
has changed to black and white
stripes and his Gryfﬁndor dorm
room no longer has windows.

It was that evil Voldemort
(George Bush) that broke Har-
ry’s wand and shut him in soli-
tary conﬁnement, all because
Harry has a penchant for wearing
turbans and hiding underground
for long periods of time.

This is not okay. I want to go
back to the more innocent days
of penal institutions, when peo-
ple didn’t have to worry about
running into terrorists while va-
cationing in the Swiss Alps. Yet,
The Powers That Be have trans-
formed our beloved penal sys-
tem into a series of illusions and
facades, where torture is likely
and invasions of civil liberties
are counted on.

The international community
has spoken out against these
violations, but no changes have
occurred.

These days, the secrecy and
lies of our government are all
too common. What will it take
to correct the mistakes of the
Voldemort administration?

 

Why we’re letting  

the readers decide ~

Police blotter column comes to a close after debates

V In January, we gave ourselves
a new mission.

We vowed to turn ourselves
around.

We made promises to the com-
munity about accuracy and rel-
evancy, and used our newfound
professionalism to test the bound-
aries of journalism.

We were not always met with
approval, but through 18 weeks
we honed our technique.

Now that we have a ﬁrm foun-
dation, we hope to expand our
abilities and use them to better
serve our readers.

Last year, we ran a feature

called “Behind Bars.”
A police blotter, “Behind
Bars” documented the arrests

made each week by Lexington
police ofﬁcers.

Similar columns run in many
campus newspapers—~in fact, in
newspapers of all types.

Readers responded resound-
ingly both for and against the
column. It brought more mail to
our inbox than has been seen in
years.

Most importantly, it stimulated
an intellectual discussion in our
community.

We received (and often printed)
many reasonable civic opinions
about whether we should make

In the past few months, both sides have had

their say. We ’ve editorialized about the journal-

istic reasons for printing it, and we ’ve proven

the legality of our actions.

public record so, well, public.

Members across the commu-
nity responded with their ideas
about protection and information
and where the line between them
should be drawn.

Sadly, not all of the discussion
was intellectual.

The reporter assigned to write
the column faced a daily onslaught
of hate mail and harassment.

He was threatened in the din-
ing hall, and confronted at par-
ties-—someone even trashed his
dorm room.

Ungentlemanly, no?

Despite these inappropriate
(and somewhat misdirected) criti-
cisms, the conversation went on.

Looking back at the letters we
received—the letters you wrote—~
we have decided to cancel the
column.

In the past few months, both
sides have had their say. We’ve

editorialized about the joumal-
istic reasons for printing it, and
we’ve proven the legality of our
actions.

But at the end of the day, what
you think matters.

Our mission is to serve the
readers.

We’re here for you.

And the readers have decided:
“Behind Bars” will no longer run
as a column.

Last school year, the Phi fo- .

cused on improving its journalis-
tic skills.

We have a strong core of re-
turning writers and editors. And
in the last week, we’ve gained an
eager and motivated group of new
staffers.

We’re growing every day.

Looking back, we’ve really _ .
turned ourselves around.

Class of 2010 gains early edge

New students build  Conﬁdence, self—reliance, deep
friendships, and houses during one week trips

By Jessica Shaw
SPORTS EDITOR

One-quarter of the freshmen
class bid their families farewell
a week early to embark on .an
adventure that would lead some
to the peaks of mountains in the
pouring rain and others to some
of the darkest slums of poverty in
the country. ’

According to Director of Cam-
pus Activities and Outing Club
Advisor James Dick, the Lead-

ing Edge program at Washington”

& Lee University began in 1995
with a hiking trip of less than ~15
students. Since then, the number
of freshmen participants has esca-
lated to over 150, and a volunteer
branch has been incorporated.

While the two branches are
very different, they share a com-
mon goal: to provide an intimate
environment for freshmen to be-
come comfortable and establish
deep friendships prior to the cha-
os of Orientation Week. "

“I cannot imagine what it
would have been like to show up
the ﬁrst day of move-in and not
know a soul,” participant Shan-
non Brunner said. “It would be so
uncomfortable.”

Leaders arrived on campus
two weeks early to undergo wil-
derness training, team building
activities, psychology seminars
and workshops teaching leaders
how to deal with any group dy-
namic issues. _‘ 

“I thi'r‘1k1_~:it"s3~' at big ’sacriﬁce,”

Dick said. “You’re giving up two

weeks of your summer.”

Twenty-six Appalachian Ad-
venture leaders split up to lead 81
freshmen to different parts of the
trail.

“As a freshman, my trip lead-
ers were my role models and
friends, and they certainly helped

me beyond that initial week in
terms of meeting people and ad-
justing to college,” Sophomore
trip leader Jen Lysenko said.

Eight groups of students hiked
between 25 and 38 miles in four
days, pitching tents each night
and securing tarps to shield them-
selves from the torrential rain. A
ninth group was focused on rock
climbing, but it had to tweak the
trip due to weather obstacles.

“My freshman orientation trip
at the time was the most chal-
lenging thing that I had ever
done,” Senior leader Erin Tainer
said. “On the ﬁrst day I thought
that I was never going to make it
through, physically or emotional-
ly, and I was homesick and farther
outside of my comfort zone than I
had ever been.”

According to Dick, who is cur-
rently in his ﬁfth year at W&L,
there are, on average, of 2.5 evac-
uations each year. He said evacua-
tions occur for numerous reasons,
ranging from allergic reactions to
illnesses. This year he said three
people were evacuated.

“One of our freshmen got a
serious rash that began the ﬁrst
night, and by the second morn-
ing we knew we had to evacuate
him,” Lysenko said. “The four to
ﬁve miles we had to hike to get
phone service was the most difﬁ-
cult part of the trip.”

‘ Freshman Andrea Null said
that Leading Edge was an expe-
rience tlpatgshe struggled with on-A

into college with.”

Despite physical struggles and
harsh weather conditions, Junior
leader Samantha Hishmeh said
her group bonded over campﬁre
games and activities.

“We played Maﬁa almost every
night, and we even took someone
‘snipe hunting’ one night, which
was highly entertaining to say the
least.”

According to Null, break-
fasts and dinners were cooked on
stoves at the sleep sites, and lunch
usually consisted of trail mix or
granola bars on the hike.

“Mealtime was deﬁnitely
something you looked forward
to,” Null said. “We had a set hour
that we would do it. Basically,
everybody pulled out all the food
out of our packs that we had been
packing the last three days, and it
was basically a free for all.”

Through the rain, soggy pan-
cakes and tough miles, a bond
developed between freshmen and
their mentors that made it easier
to approach freshman year, ac-
cording to participant Sarah J 0
Trimble.

“I deﬁnitely made some long-
lasting friendships on that trip,”
Trimble said. “This trip has deﬁ-
nitely inspired me to get involved
in other campus activities. I actu-
ally signed up for the Outing Club
during the activities fair.”

Simultaneously, students par-
ticipating in the Volunteer Ven-

ture program were divided into

“I don’t think I ’ve ever felt as
proud of myself after anything,”
Null said. “Every step you took,
you knew you could only do it
because of you. There was no one
helping you. You deﬁnitely had
a sense of personal gain. It was

four groups. Each group traveled
to a different location, lived sim-
ply and volunteered at sites serv-
ing children, the disabled and the
homeless.

“These trips are designed
to give incoming freshmen a
glimpse of the poverty that ex-
ists in our country,” Junior leader
Bonnie Fay said.

Students could sign up to go
to Roanoke, Va., Lexington, Va.,
War, W.V. and Greensboro, N.C.
Senior Camille Allen coordinated
the entire process and helped se-
lect 23 student leaders that were
assigned to one of the four loca-
tions.

“I wanted to provide a good
experience for incoming fresh-
men,” Sophomore coordinator
Rosemary Boyle said. “I wanted
to provide a comfortable transi-
tion from their summer to college
and at the same time have them
become engaged in the ﬁeld work
that the Shepherd Poverty Pro-
gram is all about.”

During the week, students slept
on the ﬂoors of church buildings,
dormitories and a community
center. The participants also had
a night where they had limited
funds to purchase food for their
“family” (a group with an average
of six people).

“The activities speciﬁcally
helped us experience on a small
scale what it is like to live in pov-
erty,” participant Dinah Danforth
said. “I not only learned from
these experiences how terrible
poverty is but also how diﬂicult
rising above it is.”

Professors visited during trips
to give students insight on the

ing one house will make a differ-
ence for an individual family, but
it will not solve the problems of
homelessness and substandard
housing.”

Grappling with former views
of poverty, freshmen watched
ﬁlms, participated in activities
and engaged in deep discussions,
often sharing very conﬂicting
viewpoints.

“My dinner group had an
amazing talk about it,” participant
Victoria Raabe said. “It was un-
believable. That was my favorite
discussion.”

During the week, students vol-
unteered for Habitat for Human-
ity, HeadStart, Soup Kitchens, the
Salvation Army, Campus Kitchen
Project and many more organiza-
tions depending on their trip.

“Being able to see frames to
an entire room that four girls put
up by themselves was amazing,”
participant Kelsey Wright said.

Many students said they now
know how to get involved in vol-
unteer activities around campus.

“I’m considering doing Cam-
pus Kitchen because it was such a
great experience,” Wright said. “I
can see myself going down with
a group of friends on Tuesday
nights and making food.”

Dick said one of the most im-
portant qualities of the trip is that
it establishes deep friendships that

XC off to running start

Freshmen perform Saturday for both men and women in season opener

By Jessica Shaw
SPORTS EDITOR

Freshmen standouts on both
the men and women’s cross-
country teams led the Generals
to matching wins at the Washing-
ton & Lee Invitational Saturday
morning.

On the women’s side, sopho-
more Becca Taylor stunned the
crowds as she ﬁnished ﬁrst by
four seconds (20:54.00), outrun-
ning Roanoke opponent Mallory
McClaine (2025800).

‘‘I saw two [Roanoke girls] up
in front of me, and I decided to go
for it,” Taylor said. “After it was
over, I couldn’t believe it.”

Taylor was followed by a trio
of freshmen with Mary Frances
Weatherly in fourth (21:1l.00),
Dorothy Todd in sixth (21:20.00)
and Annie Casper in tenth
(22:10.00). Senior captain Jenny
Ratzel clocked in at 22: 16.00 ﬁn-
ishing twelfth for the Generals.

For the men, junior Andrew
Friski was the Generals’ top com-
petitor ﬁnishing seventh with a
time of 30:14.00. Three fresh-
men ﬁnished on his heels posting
times within ﬁve seconds of each
other. Freshmen Benjamin Stutts,

crossed the ﬁnish in eighth, ninth
and tenth place respectively eam-
ing times of 30:16.00, 30:17.00
and 30:21.00.

“We are incredibly pleased
with the performances of the
freshmen,” captain David Kro-
nenfeld said. “Going from the
5K in high school to the 8K in

college can be a diﬂicult transi-
tion. We are very pleased to see
them handle the transition so
well.”

Last year, both teams placed
fourth at Regionals, and accord-
ing to ODAC Runner and Rookie
of the Year sophomore Jackie
Burns, the team has even higher

expectations for this season.

“We’re closing the gap,” she
said. “There’s a much smaller gap
than there used to be between the
ﬁrst and last runner. I think we
have a shot at Nationals, which
would be great. It’s really excit-
ing to see what the freshmen can
do.”

Coach’s memory lives

Community remembers Amy Reistrup, husband replaces her as coach

By Lara Jordan
STAFF WRITER

After a brief battle with can-
cer, riding coach Amy Reistrup
passed away July 7, leaving a
2006 ODAC Coach of the Year
title and a team she led to win the
2005-06 ODAC Championship.

“Amy was a great person and.

just a lot of fun to be around,” said
senior Katherine Tompkins. “She
had a light-hearted approach to
everything, but was still competi-
tive, which is sometimes a hard
balance to have. There honestly
wasn’t anyone on the team who
didn’t absolutely love her, and I
think that’s a pretty rare thing.”
Teammates said Reistrup
coached with a no-pressure tech-
nique, always encouraging riders.
“Amy coached as she lived
her life,” said junior Alice Shih.
“She told us not to sweat the little
things and to enjoy what was in
front of us. At shows, she always
told me to just breathe and enjoy
the experience. She was also very
demanding in that she knew we
were capable of more than we

ourselves knew.”

As the team recovers from the
loss, Reistrup’s husband, Gordon
Reistrup, will take over her posi-
tion.

“Gordon has extensive experi-
ence in intercollegiate riding, and
already is familiar with many of
us on the team,” said senior Brit-
tany Bansak. “We are honored
that Gordon has chosen to coach
us this year and look forward to
riding with him.”

The riders feel that it will be
easier to adjust to the loss with
Gordon Reistrup as the new
coach.

“[Gordon] and Amy ran their
farm together, coaching and rid-
ing, so they’ll have the same
coaching philosophies and ideas
about what it takes to succeed,”
said Tompkins. “This will make

the change much easier to handle,
and [it] takes away a lot of anxi-
ety about what the new coach will
be like and what he will want to
see.”
Overall, the team has an opti-
mistic attitude for this season.
“This year will be a bit of a
rebuilding year, because we lost
our top two riders, who gradu-
ated, and we also had a couple of
people transfer,” Tompkins said.

“I think we should be pretty com-
petitive, and I just can’t wait to
see what new riders this year will
bring.”

The team is hopeful they will
remain successful, as they carry
on the lessons of Amy Reistrup.

Shih said, “We will all miss
her terribly, but what she has
taught us is still very much with
us in our riding as well as in our
personal lives.”

Their overall record sat at 32-5 in-

begin the season strong at 4-0.

At the awards ceremony, soph-
omores Jess Ulrich and Kassie
Bagley and junior Jess Hudock
earned All-Toumament Team
Honors. Senior captain Lauren
Edmonson was named Most Valu-
able Player of the tournament.

According to Ulrich, the
toughest competition was found
in Averett University. The Gener-
als out-played the Cougars at the
Averett Tournament last fall 3-0.

“We really stepped up against
Averett,” junior Lauren Rudolf
said. “We’re so deep in so many
positions that we’re able to change
the line-up and bring a new level
of intensity to each game. We had
a lot better ball control, and we
passed better, so we had better
offense so we could put the ball
down when we needed to.”

Friday night, the two teams
battled to a ﬁnal score of 30-20,
30-23, 30-18. Though the Gener-
als looked strong throughout, all
three games were hard to gauge,
because the points remained about
even until the ﬁnal stretch.

“We clearly got outplayed
by W&L,” Averett coach Danny
Miller said. “I was really im-
pressed by the way we played
against UVa-Wise. Not to take
anything away from W&L, but
we could play better. We didn’t
have the same enthusiasm. We
have to get our intensity up.”

The rest of the matches ended
relatively quickly as the ladies si-
lenced SVU 30-19, 30-21, 30-15,
McDaniel 30-23, 30-24, 30-17
and UVa-Wise 30-21, 30-15, 30-
9.

All three teams had games
under their belt before the tour-
nament while W&L was starting
with fresh legs. '

“We deﬁnitely went in there
and jumped on the other teams,”
Bagley said. “It’s really hard
coming into a tournament when
the other teams have already had
a week of season and start off re-
ally well.”

The Generals have a young
team this season with eight fresh-
men and ﬁve sophomores. They
return only two juniors and two
seniors.

“We lost a lot of good seniors,
so we really had to adjust our of-
fense,” Ulrich said.

According to Bagley, the Gen-
erals hope to perform better at the
NCAA tournament this year. Last
year, they lost in the ﬁrst round to
Southwestern University 3-0.

“I feel like we are going to
have a really strongjteam,” she
said. “We are deﬁnitely going
to put up a ﬁght against other
teams.”

Kitchen kicks

Volunteers provide comfort to
Rockbridge s underprivileged

By Dane Davis
STAFF WRITER

ith a goal of serv-
ing 200 meals a
week to local resi-

dents, the Campus Kitchen
project got underway last
Thursday.

The kickoff event, held in
Evans Hall, featured a variety of
speakers and guests who came to
celebrate the opening of the new
chapter.

Dr. Harlan Beckley, director of
the Washington and Lee’s Shep-
herd Poverty Program, began
the event by explaining W&L’s
groundbreaking role in service
and poverty education.

The program then shifted to
theorigins of Campus Kitchen
at W&L. Senior Maggie Puryear
explained how Ingrid Easton,
a member of the class of 2005,
was moved by the poverty she
witnessed through the Shepherd
Poverty Program. After an intem—
ship at the D.C. Central Kitchen,
Easton was compelled to do
something here at W&L. She met
with various officials and was
given permission to start a Cam-
pus Kitchen chapter on campus.

Following Easton’s story,
University President Ken Ruscio
spoke on the importance of Cam-
pus Kitchen as a student governed
and supported organization.

Tom Petty, a 1983 W&L Law
School graduate and chairman
of D.C. Central Kitchen, and
Abby Flottemesch, Development
& Communications Manager
for Campus Kitchen, spoke af-
ter President Ruscio and offered
their comments on poverty and
the Campus Kitchen program.

The event concluded with an
Iron Chef-style cook off involv-
ing students and faculty. Dishes
included balsamic green bean
salad, summer chicken salad and
graham cracker pudding pie.

Campus Kitchen traces its
roots back to the non-proﬁt D.C.
Central Kitchen. Founded by
Robert Egger, the D.C. Central
Kitchen recycled the food sur-
pluses of the Washington, D.C.
area by collecting and serving the
unused food.

The success of D.C. Central
Kitchen’s efforts led two students
from Wake Forest University to
pilot a similar program.

Eventually the two methods
collided to form a student run or-
ganization emulating the model of

the
D.C.
Cen-
tral
Kitch-
en. The
new pro-

gram, named Cam- pus
Kitchen, has quickly expanded to
incorporate ten universities and
one high school. Campus Kitchen
has provided more than 360,000
meals since its inception in 2001.

Campus Kitchen goes beyond
simply distributing meals. The
organization’s motto “Teach.
Reach. Feed. Lead.” exempliﬁes
the different approach Campus
Kitchen takes.

Campus Kitchen focuses on
the individual and his or her need
for love, affection and friendship.
Volunteers who deliver the food
spend time talking with those
who receive the meals.

This challenges students’ per-
ceptions of poverty and encour-
ages them to see the poor as in-

dividuals not so different from
themselves. Participants cite this
personalized attention to the poor
as a main reason for joining.

Alice Shih, an intern at Cam-
pus Kitchen, said, “Working in the
Shepherd Poverty concentration,
I have always been very inter-
ested in integrating what I learned
with volunteering operations. In
addition, Campus Kitchen has a
holistic approach to eliminating
hunger and poverty in our com-
munity. I am very excited to work
with the entire community, not
just Washington and Lee.”

One key feature to the Campus
Kitchen outlook is the idea that
the one of the causes of poverty--a
lack of j ob skills--must be rectiﬁed
for poverty to come to an end. Ac-

Bookstore battles costs

As the cost of textbooks spirals higher and

higher with each passing year, University

Bookstore managers Bill and Maureen Becker

work to help students watch the bottom line

By Kate Shellnutt
STAFF WRITER

The university bookstore ex-
panded its return policy this year,
requiring students to provide doc-
umentation of schedule changes
when exchanging books.

The policy changes came
about aﬁer the store’s c0-direc-
tors, Bill and Maureen Becker,
noticed some students ordered
their textbooks online, purchased
the same ones books at the book-
store and then returned them once
the books they ordered arrived.

“That’s taking a book away
from someone else,” said Mau-
reen Becker, “so it messes with
our numbers.”

The new policy went into ef-
fect this summer and regulated
returns through September 13, the
last day to return textbooks.

The Beckers do not see online
book-buying as a threat. It has
not yet had noticeable effects on
the store’s business, as the Uni-
versity Bookstore continues to
sell over 20,000 textbooks each

term. While they encourage stu-
dents to support the school’s store,
they understand the incentives for
comparison-shopping online.

“I’ve bought books on Ama-
zon myself,” said Maureen.
“Sometimes you can get a good
deal. But you have to make sure
the book is the right one and in
the right condition, and that it
will arrive in time. Most students
would rather not go through that
hassle.”

For those that would, she says
the bookstore employees are will-
ing to help students ﬁnd lntema-
tional Standard Book Numbers,
or ISBNs, so they may be ordered
online. Bookstore policy does not
prohibit students from recording
these numbers.

_ The Beckers, like hundreds
of others running campus book-
stores, have noticed the skyrock-
eting textbook prices over the
last ten years. As the parents
of a W&L alumnus, the couple
also had to pay the pricey bill for
books at one time, too.

W&L is not subject to Virginia

laws that aim to control the cost
of textbooks.

Since the Beckers took over
bookstore management two years
ago, they have acted to combat
publishers’ rising prices, from
working within the store and with
faculty.

What the bookstore can do
to limit costs:

Sell used books. Used books
cost 25 percent less than new
ones. In the past two years, the
number of used books sold in the
W&L bookstore has grown by 50
percent.

Talk to deans and faculty. By
encouraging faculty to submit
book lists early, the bookstore’s
textbook manager, Brenda Reese,
can find the materials on the lists
for cheaper prices.

What professors can do to
limit costs:

Use the “old” edition. Publish-
ers often market a book’s latest
edition, even if changes to it are
minimal. If these changes are not
necessary and a professor can use
an old edition two years in a row,
the bookstore can guarantee more
used copies and cheaper prices.
Such was the case with Econ 101
books this fall.

Check for hidden extras. On-
line materials, CD-ROMS, or
workbooks may not be used in the
class, so professors can choose a
more basic “bundle.”

Add up the costs. Sometimes,
professors do not look at the total

  Amazon forces new bookstore return policy, but not much else

costs of their course materials.
With coursepacks and a stack of
textbooks, the price may grow to
be unreasonable.

What students can to do
limit costs:

Give feedback. If you were
required to buy materials that
were not used enough, or worse,
were not used at all, let your pro-
fessor know how you feel. He or
she may reconsider whether or
not to require it the next term.

Sell books back. By selling
your books back at the end of
the term, you are putting more
used books on the shelves for
the following term.

Even if the book you sold
back ends up in Wisconsin, the
total number of books bought
back helps the store earn more
used ones.

Double check prices and
shop around. Inadvertent over-
charges had Professor Suzanne
Keen’s English 355 class paying
a total of$12.50 more for four of
its paperback novels. The book-
store is refunding the difference
between the cover price and the
overcharges.

Keen tries to keep in mind
the ﬁnancial burden of the texts
she assigns--up to 12 each se-
mester--because of her academic
discipline.

She, like other professors,
posts booklists online so stu-
dents can buy them before they
reach campus.

cordingly,
Campus
Kitchen has
a job-training
program that
teaches the re-
cipients of its aid
how to become
trained chefs. Cam-
pus Kitchen works
with the newly trained
chefs to secure them em-
ployment. Since the program’s
founding, 67 people have been
given the skills necessary to enter
the work environment. Campus
Kitchen also works with local
mothers to educate them in nutri-
tional skills.

Despite being relatively new,
W&L’s chapter is already busy
reaching out to the community
and collecting food. W&L’s Cam-
pus Kitchen is targeting local or-
ganizations such as Habitat for
Humanity to be recipients for the
food.

A campus-wide food drive
has gathered over 1,100 pounds

of food goods and is still receiv- _

ing donations. The organization
looks to serve 200 to 250 meals

pansion to 400 meals per week.
Campus Kitchen’s partnership
with the Elrod Commons Mar-
ketplace allows the program to
collect excess food not eaten by
W&L students. Campus Kitchen
continues to be student-run, but it
is dependent on the entire W&L
body for continued success.

Everyone, even those not en-
rolled with the Shepherd Poverty
Program, can be involved. Posi-
tions include two hour cooking
shifts three days a week, two hour
delivery shifts three days a week
and every day twenty minute food
pickups.

Busy schedule? Not a prob-
lem.

Caitlin Schopp, Campus
Kitchen Coordinator for W&L,
says that students can come in at
any time, as long as they send an
e-mail or phone call beforehand.
Campus Kitchen is not an obliga-
tion for students who want to get
involved, but rather an opportu-
nity.

Located in the Beta House,
Campus Kitchen’s doors are al-
ways open to anyone willing to
lend an extra hand.

Raiding the
EC’s wallet

Clubs hope to strike it rich during
the annual handout of E C funds

By Sacha Raab
snxrr warren

Nearly every student on Wash-
ington and Lee’s campus is a
member of at least one club or
organization.

Without sufficient funding
from the Executive Committee,
however, these groups would not
be able to exist.

In order to receive funding
from the committee, each group
needs to be officially recognized
as a club.

To receive this designation,
the group ﬁlls out a form explain-
ing its philosophy and why it is a
beneﬁcial addition to campus or-
ganizations.

The forms are then returned to
the EC. Once official, the group
applies to receive money from the
committee.

The president and vice-presi-
dent of the committee then review
the list of groups and estimate
how much ﬁnancing each group
needs.

They take into consideration
how much money was spent by
each club in past years and each
club’s success.

The president and vice presi-
dent then deliver their estimates
to the EC, which then discusses

each proposal and decides on an
appropriate distribution of funds.

The responsibility of an orga-
nization is a major factor in de-
termining how much money that
organization will receive.

Considering that the EC is us-
ing parents’ money to fund these
various clubs, it is important to
know exactly how the money is
used.

When a group approaches the
committee, it must already have
a solid idea of how much money
they need and have speciﬁc ac-
tivities either in mind or already
planned.

The organization must be le-
gitimate, with a decent amount of
interest and goals.

Tye Haeberle, EC vice presi-
dent, said, “The higher the stakes,
the more legitimate they [the
clubs] have to be.”

When considering whether to
accept a new club or how much
to fund an existing club, the com-
mittee focuses on underclassmen
interest. This way, they can ensure
that the club will remain existent,
and hopefully popular.

Haeberle also said that each
organization is responsible for
itself. “The EC can’t babysit the

  W&L goes nuclear

Professor Frank Settle examines the future of nuclear energy

Washington and Lee and the Council on For-

eign Relations team up to study the future of

nuclear energy, addressing issues of climate

change, energy security, terrorism, nuclear

proliferation and radioactive waste disposal

By Cody Beauchamp
STAFF WRITER

The prestigious Council on
Foreign Relations will join Wash-
ington and Lee this year to discuss
the future of nuclear energy.

W&L Professor Frank Settle
will represent the University in
collaboration with Dr. Charles
Ferguson of the Washington-
based Council in producing a spe-
cial report to Congress slated to
be published in January of 2007.

Settle said that he hopes the
project--entitled “The Nuclear
Energy Project”--will “provide
information and opinions that will
stimulate discussion on the future
of nuclear power.”

He said that not many Ameri-
cans, even members of Congress,
are very well-educated
nuclear issues. He has high hopes
that the report will “get the atten-
tion of the higher education com-
munity” especially.

When discussing what speciﬁc
areas the project hopes to address,
Dr. Ferguson said, “the project
should examine what contribu-
tion nuclear energy can make to
alleviating climate change...and

about _

contributing to energy security...”

He also listed nuclear prolif-
eration, terrorism, reactor safety
and radioactive waste disposoal
as areas he would like to see ex-
amined.

Ferguson explained that the
report’s release date was selected
speciﬁcally to coincide with the
start of the 2007 Congressional
session.

Said Ferguson, “I would hope
that the report will educate Con-
gress about the importance of
controlling global warming and
the role that nuclear energy could
have in contributing to solving
that challenge...Congress will
have to think carefully about the
long term implications of favor-
ing one source [of energy] over
another.”

Settle said that discussing the
long-term use of nuclear energy
sources is especially important
now because “Right now about
20 percent of our national energy

pressing questions of economic
feasibility and safety currently
surrounding nuclear power.

“The big issues are economic,
such as ‘are people really going
to invest in this?’... [And] safe-
ty. One bad accident at a nuclear
power plant anywhere in the
world will kill nuclear power,”
said Settle.

Additionally, Settle noted that
the report will spend some time
addressing nuclear energy as a
threat, because “anytime you have
a nuclear power plant, you have
the potential to produce weapons-
grade material.”

In conjunction with the report
to Congress, the project will also
host seminars and round tables on
nuclear issues, two of which will
be held in Lexington.

Ferguson also plans on writ-
ing a book examining the use of
nuclear energy in the U.S. and
abroad, while Settle will be teach-
ing a course that “will address the
role of nuclear energy in provid-
ing power for our future power

needs,” for the Spring 2007 term.

Settle and the Council on For-
eign Relations are recieving fund-
ing from The H.F. Gerry Lenfest
Foundation as well as the Cam-
egie Corporation, the Lounsberry
Foundation and the MacArthur
Foundation.

Lenfest is the W&L alumnus
who also donated $3 million to-
wards the construction of the
Lenfest Center for the Arts.

Settle and Ferguson share high
hopes that the Project will be
successful in provoking thought
about the future of nuclear en-
ergy, especially, Ferguson said,
because both organizations “bring
strong credentials to the project.”

“I believe this project will
stand out,” said Ferguson. “The
Council has a reputation as a truly
nonpartisan think tank. Washing-
ton and Lee has a reputation as
one of the leading institutions of
higher learning.”

He believes both groups will
beneﬁt as they examine nuclear
energy and its future.

Haeberle said the
groups should be respon-
sible about having backup
money sources so as not
to completely rely on the
Committee’s funding.

The Office of Student
Activities, run by James
Dick, will begin to help
ﬁnance club sports, so that
the groups have an addi-
tional source of income and
do not have to rely on the
EC for all of their funding.

Certain groups have re-
ceived more money some
years than they have in oth-
ers.

Some clubs receive
more money with their pro-
posals because they need
it, and others because they
earn it.

Often, a group can get
more ﬁmding by demon-
strating its importance to
the community.

Groups demonstrate
their role in the community
through service and student
involvement.

Why must W&L is so—called ladies and gentlemen become clﬁerent people after the sun goes down?

By Cody Beauchamp

COLUMNIST

“Hooking up.”

After drinking and Vineyard
Vines, it’s the Washington and
Lee vice of choice. I regularly
hear the boasts of some guy in-

tent on “scoring” (or some other,

far more unprintable term) with
“babe X.”

Men rib each other about the
“fly honeys” they admire. It is
such a part of the atmosphere here

that it rivals the speaking tradition

and an appreciation for Traveller
as part of our communal charac-

ter.

And it’s wrong in almost every
way.

Don’t misunderstand me--the
sexual revolution has come (no
pun intended). If you want to
“rock the Casbah,” you can, fre-
quently so, and with virtually no
social criticism to boot.

lt’s not the idea of hooking up
at W&L that is troublesome--it’s’

the execution.

Men are looking at sex all the
wrong way. Worse yet, women
are allowing them. Sex for the av-
erage man more resembles foot-

ball than feelings—-hooking up is

all about putting up big numbers.
And that is precisely the prob-
lem.

Sex is (cliche as it sounds) a

very emotional experience. Even
when the hook-up is late night
and courtesy of Messers. Natty
and Jack, there is still emotion
invested. The investment may be
one-sided or slight, but pretend-
ing it is not present is naive.

Yet the attitude allowed to pre-
vail is that sex is so commonplace

that it barely registers outside

of locker room-esque bravado.
Sex means nothing, or at least it
should mean nothing. It is easy. It
is cheap.

And that perception is wrong.

To the dismay of this writer,
men bear most of the blame. When
a man stops seeing a hook-up as a
pleasant surprise and starts seeing
it as an entitlement, he robs the
woman of her dignity.

Even though social pressures
dictate that women here should
want to have sex, what they do
with their bodies (and whom they
allow to do those things) is still a
very personal and important deci-
sion. But this is not the message
many men send women night in/
night out.

Men have quit caring about
personality, about whether his
partner is fun or exciting. We see
hooking up as something that is
out of her control.

It’s not a mutual choice. It’s a
game of coercion.

For the boorish man simply

Men are looking at sex all the wrong way. 

Sex for the average man more resembles foot-

ball than feelings — hooking up is all about put-

ting up big numbers.

looking to score, this is a spectac-
ular arrangement. But it smacks
of just that--boorishness. It does
not reflect well on our fratemi-
ties, our school, or our gender en
masse.

Again, do not misunderstand
me--if a cavalier lifestyle with
multiple partners is your desire,
there is arguably nothing wrong
with that. ' _

But when this lifestyle is cou-
pled with a predatory mindset,
you quit being a gentleman and
start being a reason to hate sex.
Men who hook up with no regard
for what the woman takes from it
are making hook-ups look bad.
This is how feelings get hurt and
reputations get ruined.

In the most extreme cases, this
is how rape is born. This attitude
robs sex of its fun and tums it into
something regrettable. The sexu-
ally active students of this school
should hold themselves to higher

standards.

Gentlemen, we must quit
looking at women as objects. It’s
degrading and chauvinistic. It re-
ﬂects poorly upon each one of us
and is wholly unattractive.

If you have an eye for a certain
girl, ﬁne. But respect her enough
to at least talk to her before the
Beirut table runs dry and Travel-
ler is making its last run. Get to
know her. (You may end up lik-
ing her for more than just looks.
Gasp!)

The bottom line--make it a
choice for her. Because it is her
choice, never yours.

Ladies--ﬁnd the gentlemen.

You’ll know them, they’re the
ones that can make you laugh be-
fore you’ve lost some ﬂip-cup.

They hold the door and still
talk to you the morning aﬁer (ide-
ally the moming before).

They will be discreet and make
sure you take something good

away from the experience.

They will opt not to have sex
when it’s clear you have had too
much and‘ can’t really decide
wisely. They will respect your
boundaries and take “no” to mean
no.

Don’t want to go all the way?
They will accept that. They make
it about you as well as themselves.
They make it fun, not regrettable.

’ By the way, ladies, here’s a lit-
tle trick to see just how interested
he really is: “Here’s my number.
Call me tomorrow.” Wait until
you can actually make a good de-
cision. It could save you a world
of awkward regrets.

Besides, it takes courage to hit
on a girl when she has all her nor-
mal inhibitions--trust me. What
woman wants a coward?

Now I’m sure that by now in
the school year many of us are

uncomfortably straddling the
line between gentlemen and cad,
lady and loose woman. Many of
us have already made some deci-
sions we regret. But this should
not keep us from resolving to
change. No matter how uncom-
fortable it may be to take stock of
your actions, the need is pressing-
—especially for gentlemen. What’s
done is done, and for what it’s
worth we can all say it together:
mea culpa. We still need to turn
our thoughts towards the future.

We hold ourselves to high
standards here at W&L. We self-
police ourselves so that none are
allowed to break our communal
trust. And yet we don’t seem to
hold ourselves to any standards of
civility at night.

Why not? Why is the “sketchy
hook-up” still an acceptable part
of W&L’s social life?

Wall Won’t WOI'k

Minutemen want to stop them, but they ’re already here

By Abel S. Delgado
co LUM msr

Here’s to the Minutemen.
Yours is truly a dying breed. You
represent all that America once
was and is now slowly but surely
refusing to be. The racism, the
nativism, the ignorance: it’s all
yours and one day it will all be
gone.

You patrol the borders to keep
“illegals” out. Never mind that
probably less than a century ago,
it was your ancestors who came
here illegally.

You talk of laws to stop im-
migration. Never mind that it was
your ancestors who either bene-
ﬁted from the ﬂoodgate immigra-
tion of Europeans into our great
country or were devastated when
those ﬂoodgates were closed.

You look at our border with
Mexico with disgust. Never mind
that you look at Ellis Island with
admiration. You talk of America
as the “Land of the Free.” Never
mind that you want to deny others
that freedom.

Now, you want a wall. Never
mind history. If you read the Bi-
ble, you would know that since
the time of Jericho, walls haven’t
worked.

Did the Great Wall of China
stop the Mongol invasion?

And what about the Berlin
Wall? Didn’t everyone’s favor-
ite conservative president, Ron-
ald’ Reagan, demand it be taken
down?

Wasn’t the Berlin Wall similar
in ﬁmction to a wall on our bor-
der, keeping those in a less suc-
cessful country out of a prosper-

ous one? Isn’t it a political tool
that separates families?

What do you think Reagan, if
he were alive, would say about
your wall? Do you think he would
join you with your riﬂes “patrol-
ling the border?”

The real reason you patrol
those borders is out of fear. No,
not of terrorists. You would be
patrolling the Canadian border,
where the Sept. 11 hijackers en-
tered the country, if terrorism was
your real worry.

Not of drugs either. If that
were the case then you wouldn’t
consume so many drugs.

And you don’t fear most of the
people crossing it to cam a decent
wage either. You don’t fear the
one who mows your lawn, the
one who valets your car, or the
one who cashiers at the fast food
restaurant you frequently visit.
You don’t fear all those unskilled
low-wage earning workers who
help keep prices down and social
security aﬂoat.

The truth is you fear me, the
ﬁrst generation American. You
fear that I am alongside your son
at a competitive college, not be-
cause of afﬂrmative action, but
because my grades were the same,
and we get along great.

You fear that I will one day
work alongside your daughter at
a successful job, and it will help
me that I am bilingual. You fear
that one day I will take my place
in your government.

You fear our generation.
You fear our buying power, our
changes to pop-culture, our “his-
panization of American culture.”
You fear the Shakira poster on
your son’s wall and the Enrique
Iglesias lyrics coming from your
daughter’s lips in a language you
refuse to understand. You fear
turning on the television and see-
ing more than one channel with
that language. You fear showing
up to the polls one day and having
to vote for someone whose name
you can’t even pronounce.

So you patrol the borders,
you lobby for stricter laws, and
you may even build a wall. But
it’s too late. I’m in here already.
We’re in here already. This is my
country as much as it is yours. I
am as a big a patriot as you are,
if not more, because I will never

Stop whining
about drinking

If students want change, they should make it

We’ve heard a lot of whin-
ing in the past two weeks.

Campus-wide, students are
complaining about the state’s
new hard line on underage
drinking -- and Lexington’s
tough enforcement of the new
policies.

The Pole Houses were
rocked by the Rockbridge
County sheriffs last weekend
when they came into a party
to check identiﬁcation.

Students have been picked
up walking away from par-
ties, buying food at Stop-In
and waiting for rides.

Law enforcement officials
are sending the message:
don’t drink underage.

This puts quite a cramp in
the side of our traditional uni-
versity social life.

Instead of drowning our
sorrows in a case of cheap
beer, why not actually do
something?

The students that go to
this school seem to be at least
relatively bright people.

We get good grades
while we’re here. We have a
widely respected school of

commerce, economics and
politics. We have a powerful
graduate law program.

On an even more basic
level, we know people. Our
parents and alumni are mov-
ers and shakers.

And yet we’d rather go on
letting this happen.

Complaining about get-
ting in trouble for drinking
underage -- an illegal activity
-- is ridiculous.

It’s a waste of time.

Usually you can get away
with it.

But when you get caught,
it’s hard to call yourself a
victim.

There was a time when
students cared enough about
the way they were treated by
the outside world.

Students in Germany
started a revolution that
eventually changed the lan-
guage itself.

Here in the United States,
students worked together to
get the voting age lowered
to 18.

You’re competent enough
to decide on the leader of the

free world, but not enough to
have a glass of wine at din-
ner?

Only South Korea, Japan
and Iceland have drinking
ages over 18.

Only the United States
has one over 21.

We know the facts. We’ve
had the arguments.

We even have the resourc-
es.

With all of this on our
side, what keeps the student
body generally apathetic to
something so inﬂuential to
our lifestyles?

What is particularly dis-
turbing is how personal this
argument could get.

Legislators get tougher
each year.

Police get more aggres-
sive in their enforcement
tactics.

But we can’t blame the
police. They’re just enforc-
ing the laws.

We have the intelligence.
We have political clout.

Don’t sit back and whine
about how it’s so unfair.

Make something happen.

Contentious
play not porn

Tits & Blood a metaphor for powerful women

By Sarah Kientz
STAFF WRITER

A million and a half tickets
sold. There were 28,014 different
performances of 1,864 plays in
261 theaters in 22 days. Welcome
to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe,
where Washington and Lee stu-
dents performed Neil LaBute’s
“Tits & Blood.”

Over the summer, theater stu-
dents traveled to Scotland to per-
form before hundreds of people
at the largest arts festival in the
world.

Theater director Tom Ander-
son said the performance was
well-received in Edinburgh.

“It was really successful on
an artistic and creative level be-
cause the company did such great
work,” Anderson said.

Junior Libby Moore, a mem-
ber of the theater company, said
audiences in Edinburgh either
loved or hated the play.

“We’d much rather have peo-
ple be passionate about it no mat-
ter what,” Moore said. “No one «
leaves the theater indiﬂ°erent, and
as long as no one thinks it’s just
ok, then l’ll be happy.”

Moore said one of the hardest
parts of the experience was re-
ceiving bad reviews from critics.

“It was really taxing having
to deal with reviewers who hated

the show and said that we’ll end

up working in the porn industry,”
Moore said.

Only one of the negative re-
views attacked the actors, Ander-
son said. He dismissed the review,
saying it was written by “one of
those guys who would have at-
tacked God.”

As in the W&L community,
Moore said the name of the play
caused a stir overseas.

“There was many an audience
member in Edinburgh who was
disappointed that this is not a strip
show,” Moore said. “There’s no
actual tits and blood in the show,
which is very disappointing.”

Anderson said the play’s de-
ceiving title was originally a joke.
Neil LaBute, professional play-
wright and friend of Anderson,
wrote the play with the original
title “The Dyad: Two Scenes of
Contention,” but added jokingly
that they could work together to
come up with something catchier,
like “Tits & Blood.” As time went
by, LaBute became more serious
about the title, and asked for it to
be changed, Anderson said.

“At this point we’d already sent
copies of the script to the festival,
and had to call to ask if we could
change the title,” Anderson said.
“The festival was excited about it
because it would be more conten-
tious and sell more tickets.”

The new title worked won-
ders, as “Tits & Blood” became

the most recognized name in Ed-
inburgh, Anderson said.

“We had the most successful
ad campaign at the festival,” An-
derson said.

However, the title was not ar-
bitrary, Anderson said.

“The play’s about dark
thoughts, violence and powerful
women who seek revenge and
sexual potency,” Anderson said.
“There’s a metaphor here about
control and women in possession
of their own lives.”

Because of the controversial
content, the company worried
about how the play would be re-
ceived at home, junior Lauren
Sapikowski said.

“We’re used to performing it
for actors and directors and the
theater community,” Sapikowski
said, “so I’m worried about how
the W&L community will react
to it.”

“I like that the audience was
involved,” sophomore Kate Corr
said. “It was unique.”

Sophomore Kiki Moreo said
she continued to think about the
play even after she left the the-
ater.

“I liked the play. It was really
different from my expectations,”
Moreo said. “The point was to
think about it aﬁerward and I deﬁ-
nitely did,” she said.

“I thought about it for the rest
of the day.”

Peace cranes for 9/ :11.

W&L remembered the five year anniversary of the terrorist attacks with several
events, including an origami table sponsored by PAACE. The group taught other
students how to make cranes, a symbol of world peace. Prayers, discussions

Wilson Hall tuned to students’ need

Long due ﬁne arts building shows oﬁ’ new technology

By Abri Nelson
STAFF WRITER

Wilson Hall blends into the
Lenfest Center so well that it is
diﬂicult from the outside to dis-
cern how different the two build-
ings look from the inside.

But as soon as students step
through the connecting doorways,
they can see the difference.

“People’s jaws are dropping
when they come into this space.
It’s so big!” said music professor
Tim Gaylard.

Now that the theater, art, mu-
sic and dance departments are all
in the same building, it is much
easier for them to collaborate on
such projects as the annual spring
term musical, which started last
year.

“I love Wilson Hall,” said
junior Lauren Sapikowski. “It
is so beautiful, it feels open and
free! Now I feel like I’m going
into a studio as opposed to walk-
ing into a cave to go to all my art
classes.”

Wilson Hall boasts seemingly
endless improvements, including

a performance hall speciﬁcally
tuned for musical performance,
practice rooms that dampen out-
side sound, a photography studio,
a design computer lab, a print-
making studio and ‘-‘smart class-
rooms” with special technology
for studying music and art.

Senior Sam Wilmoth said, “It
is hard for me to express how ex-
cited I am that the university has
made such a wonderful invest-
ment...My only regret is that I
only get to spend one year using
Wilson Hall.”

While some of the more ad-

vanced studios are closed to stu-
dents not enrolled in arts classes
because of the expensive equip-
ment they contain, the majority of
Wilson Hall is open to the entire
student body with the hopes of
making the building a place where
students can study and relax, like
the Elrod Commons.

Students like Sapikowski also
feel safer in Wilson Hall because
a university card is required for
access to the building at night.

This makes it easier for all stu-
dents to study and practice after
hours.

Both Sapikowski and Wilmoth
expressed hope that the student
body, especially those not cur-

rently involved in the arts, would
take advantage of the new build-
ing, whether by coming to enjoy
the varied types of perfonnances
or by enrolling in classes.

“I know so many people who
have graduated without setting a
foot in Lenfest,” said Sapikowski.
“Students should try to branch
out. I hope to see more students
coming to a variety of produc-
tions.”

For Spice, the best part of the
new building was the ﬁrst day of
classes.

“It came alive and you could
hear students’ voices,” he said. “I
thought, this is what the building
is all about.”

Soccer meets goal

Men destroy all lcompetition, look to improve preseason third place ranking

By Mike Huntress
STAFF WRITER

After an impressive 5-1 with
against Marymount Saturday
evening, Washington and Lee’s
men’s soccer team moved to 4-0,
the ﬁrst time since 2000 they have
been able to boast such a record.

That was also the last year they
won the ODAC conference tour-
nament, after ﬁnishing with an
18-1 record (8-1 in conference).

While it’s too early to start
projecting whether or not they can
repeat that feat, the Generals have
looked strong so far, outscoring
opponents 19-2, the fewest goals
yielded by any team in the ‘ODAC
this season.

While they have yet to play
a conference game, their season
opening win against Southern Vir-
ginia University is noteworthy.

After losing to the Knights last
year, the Generals “had a point
to prove,” according to assistant
coach Michael Piranian.

They did just that in the ﬁfty-
fourth minute when junior mid-
ﬁelder Josh Dodds scored the
lone goal of the contest.

The only other close game of
the year was a 2-1 win over Cath-

olic University, in which goals

were scored by seniors Kyle Gar--

cia and Rhett McCraw.

That’s going to be a trend with
the Generals this year: reliance on
senior experience. W&L’s six se-
niors make up the core of what is
a mature, veteran team.

“It’s their leadership and ex-
perience that will bring everyone
together. They’re the gel that will

‘make ‘us successful,” said Pira-

nian.

Every starter is a returner from
last year’s team, which is why
Piranian’s comment, “We hope to
exceed last year’s record (of 9-6-
2),” is a bit of an understatement.

The Generals’ strength is in
its defense, where the entire back
line possesses captain status. (Not
that the offense lacks punch.)
Blueﬁeld can attest to that after
an 11-0 drubbing at Watt Field on
Thursday.

Notables up front include Gar--
cia and junior Jack Palmer. Garcia

has made three shots on goal and_

has contributed three assists.
Palmer boasts seven shots on
goal and ﬁve points for the Gen-
erals. ,

leading scorer [last year], and we

had to score, players gave much
of the credit to opportunities pre-

For most of the game, Martin was
covered by Sewanee comerbacks
AJ Johnson and Fred Rhodes,
both of whom are 6 feet tall.
Martin’s lone touchdown re-
ception of the game was a ball
thrown high by Dawkins, relying
on Martin’s height and athletic
ability to out-jump the comer-
back covering him, which he ef-

fectively did. _ I

The game was also the univer-
sity’s annual Hall of Fame induc-
tion ceremony. At halftime, four
W&L athletes were honored for
their athletic achievements, in-
cluding star tennis player Marilyn
Baker ’95, the only woman in his-
tory to win three ODAC Player of
the Year awards in tennis.

record to 2-1.

 

have high expectations for him...
Kyle Garcia is a senior who’s a
leader on and off the ﬁeld,” Pira-
nian said. .

The Generals also get contri-
butions from its youngest mem-
bers, with Piranian saying, “some
freshman might crack the lineup,”
before the season’s end.

In particular, freshman Drew
Crowley has contributed one point
and one assist for the Generals in
the game against Blueﬁeld last
Thursday.

But the focus is clearly on the
here and now. The Generals gear
up for the start of conference play
on Tuesday when they take on
Bridgewater.

The Eagles were picked to ﬁn-
ish ﬁﬁh in the ODAC preseason

poll (W&L was picked third be-
hind only Virginia Wesleyan and
Roanoke) and have compiled a 2-
2 record so far this season.

“ODAC is a very competitive
schedule for us, every game is
tough,” Piranian said.

_ The Generals’ acid test will
occur on Oct. 14 when Virginia
Wesleyan, currently 6-1, rolls
into Watt Field, two weeks before
the start of the conference touma-
ment.

With expected solid play up to
that point and a win on Oct. 14, it
then may be time to start drawing
comparisons to that 2000 champi-y
onship team.

After facing the Eagles at home
on Tuesday, the Generals travel to
Hampden-Sydney on Saturday.

Freshman voices
football frustration

Huntress disappointed at lack of spirit
and attendance at ﬁrst home game

By Mike Huntress
STAFF WRITER

I have attended sporting events
shirtless, with blue paint slowly
cracking as it dries on my chest,
shorts stained with beer from the
drunken slob next to me, drib-
bling blue sweat from every pore
from ﬁghting through the throng
of people. I
have peed on
the side of a
parking ga-
rage because
the line for
the bathroom
was too long,
and seen peo-
ple emerge
bloodied
from the
rush to get to
the parking
garage and “beat the traffic” (this
last one may be a slight exag-
geration, but in New York, it’s not
much of one). This is my.image of
watching football, where the fans
are to be commended as warriors
of equal merit as the players on
the ﬁeld.

So imagine my cultural ad-
justment when I stared into the
stands this Saturday and saw a
wall of seersucker, pastels, and
Sunday dresses. I had been brac-
ing myself for it for a few days
now, told by everyone that this
is the way it would be, but still
I was shocked to be staring at
something that looked like a liv-
ing Georges Seurat painting with
way too much pink in it. Not that
I wasn’t prepared. I myself was
wearing a pink button down shirt,
khakis, and a pink tie. Not being
able to tie a tie, it’s the same one
I’ve worn to every formal func-
tion since I came to school with
it pre-tied, although I am yet yo
digest the idea of football as a
“fo_rrnal function.”

I also realize that the football
game itself was a mere footnote
to most people. For students it
was an excuse to starting drink-
ing at 11 o’clock (maybe the only
way watching the game would be
tolerable for them.) For the many

alumni I saw strolling around the
campus, it was a day to drag their
family around and talk about the
good old days while their children
feign interest. In those respects,
the day was a raging success.

I admittedly came to the game‘
late, missing the entire ﬁrst quar-
ter and most of the second. There
are about seven minutes left be-
fore halftime. I take my place in
the collage of color on the rust-
colored benches which reek of
neglect (odd, because everything
else here is so immaculate--they
obviously don’t plan on having
people spend a lot of time there)

‘and watch as Sewanee quarter-

back throws an interception. I
have seen plays like this elsewhere
excite fans to such a frenzy that
you question their mentally sta-
bility. Here, among the sea of pas-
tels, is a smattering of applause,
some cheers, and what I call the
golf clap (when one hand rests
motionless and the other gingerly
taps the ﬁrst with just the ﬁnger-
tips, which I guess is a showing of
high cultured restraint).

As halftime rolls around, the
pastels drain from the stands in a
mass exodus, which is the norm
at sporting events--just not at
halftime. I join the river of color
that’s ﬁling out down the bridge,
but not before looking back and
wondering how I feel about vio-
lating the savage principals of
sports fanship I had lived by in
my previous life. The only people
left it seems are adults, probably
many alumni, who stare placidly
at the ﬁeld, as the cheerleaders try
in vain to stir up excitement.

Notice I haven’t yet mentioned
the score, or even that the Gener-
als won. I honestly didn’t know
the result until that evening when
I looked it up online. No one even
mentioned it in passing, which
seems to be ﬁne with just about
everyone here. What’s important
is the, sum of the rituals that makes
the event part of a culture. What’s
important is every one is nicely
dressed and that everyone enjoys
tailgating and the post-game par-
ties. And in those respects, the
day was a raging success.

A nine-hour bus ride began
the weekend for the men’s and
women’s cross-country teams as
they traveled to New York City to
compete in the New York Univer-
sity Invitational.

The Generals made a strong
statement as the men plowed for-

of 28 consecutive year,

the men’s team has

Men competed against 34

ginia Wesleyan College.

Amassing 193 points, the men
ﬁnished behind Johns Hopkins

know what it feels like to win and
the upperclassmen try to keep that

Another tradition involved
in the spirit of team is the short
game. Rather than giving the ball
to the best player and letting that
player carry the team, the offense
utilizes a short game with lots
of passes and communication to
set up the shots. This strategy is
helped by good recruitment that
allows the team to ﬁeld a deep
bench.

“I think the biggest strength of
the team right now is the depth of
our bench,” junior Kendall Korte
said. “We have a really great team
dynamic.”

differences between surfaces more
than other sports since the ball is
rolled along the ground. Most
of the away games are played
on grass, while home games are
played on turf.

“Turf is faster and more pre-
dictable, and it can take a lot to
adjust to grass,” said Rubenstein.

were close to both Catholic Uni-
versity (176 points) and Adelphi
(169 points). Findlay ﬁnished ﬁrst
with 40 points followed by Johns
Hopkins with 78.

Of the top seven ﬁnishers for
the women, ﬁve were freshmen.
Dorothy Todd placed twenty-third
in 21 :01 followed by Mary Fran-
ces Weatherly who ﬁnished thir-
ty-ninth in 21:26. Annie Kasper
secured ﬁﬁieth place with a time
of 21 :40, and Elizabeth Krausnick
ﬁnished sixty-third in 22:14.

According to Brower, this
course requires a good deal of
strategy in order to perform well.

“I ran it three times in high
school for Regionals, and this is
my second time running the 8k
course, so I’ve got a lot of ex-
perience,” he said. “I think it’s
a very challenging course. It re-
wards people who arepatient and
who know how to approach the
course.”

According to head coach John
Tucker, Washington and Lee
boasts one of the most rigorous
cross-country courses in Virginia.

“It is an advantage for us to
train and race on it,” he said.
“When we get used to running on
ours, everything else is a little bit
easier for us.”

Tucker also said the team per-

formed well, especially after the
heavy training last week.

“We’re training hard these
weeks, and we’re not giving them
a lot of rest,” he said. “We have to
progress through the season, and
the end of the season is when we
are going to back off. We’re train-
ing through meets.”

O’Brien, who has completed
three marathons post-high school,
said the training has been success-
ful for numerous reasons.

“I [deﬁnitely think] the train-
ing we have been doing lately
has been building as much men-
tal touglmess as it has physical,”
O’Brien said.

In the past year, the men have
lost stars Nathan Johnson (’O5)
and Alex Mahoney (’08). Ac-
cording to Tucker, the team has
adjusted well.

“Not having Alex and Nathan
means we’ve got to step up some-
where,” he said. “The people who
have stepped into those roles have
been freshmen. While we may not
have low numbers at this point at
least so far, what we do have, is a
tighter pack. That’s how you win
races--is to have a pack.”

day in the Roanoke Invitational.

Volleyball

After its ﬁrst loss to Chris-
topher Newport on Friday
(3-1), the Generals’ volley-
ball team retaliated with full
force to defeat Virginia Wes-
leyan on Saturday morning
3-1. On Friday, the Captains
posted scores of 30-17, 28-
30, 30-26, 30-25 to defeat
the Generals. On Saturday,
the Generals outplayed the
Marlins 30-21, 22-30, 30-28,
30-25. The Generals have
posted a ﬂawless ODAC
record thus far and look to
continue that streak as they
face Guilford College on the
road Wednesday at 7 p.m.

Field Hockey

After a stellar start to its
season, the ﬁeld hockey
team fell to McDaniel Col-
lege yesterday 1-0. Junior
goal keeper Tara Ruben-
stein posted three saves. So
far, the team has defeated
Rhodes College (2-1), Cen-
tre College (1-0) and ODAC
competition Randolph-Ma-
con College (6-2). The team
looks to getter its record as
it hosts its first game this
Friday against Catholic Uni-
versity at 6 p.m.

Men’s Soccer

The men remain undefeated
this season after winning
their ﬁrst four games. Most
recently, they ﬁnished in a
deﬁnitive win over Mary-
mount (5-1) last Saturday.
The team has also defeated
Southern Virginia University
(1-0), Catholic University
(2-1) and Blueﬁeld College
(11-0). Junior J ack Palmer
has scored ﬁve of the Gen-
erals’ 19 goals including a
hat trick in the game against
Blueﬁeld last Thursday.

Women's Soccer

The women’s team shares
the incredible success of the
men’s team recently defeat-
ing ODAC competition Ran-
dolph-Macon College 7-0 on
Saturday. Junior Shana Olt-
mans and sophomore Anne
Van Devender contributed
two goals a piece. Overall,
the women have posted a
season record of 4-0. The
women have defeated teams
from Kenyon College (2-0),
Southwestern University (4-
0) and ODAC competition
Randolph-Macon Woman’s
College (11-0). Notable
players have been goal keep-
er Kiki Moreo with seven to-
tal saves and Van Devender
with seven points.

Football

The football team achieved
its ﬁrst win this season at the
ﬁrst home game last Satur-
day against Sewanee. Senior
quarterback Hunter Dawkins
threw 15 for 19 and 159
yards, and sophomore run-
ningback Stuart Sitterson ‘
rushed for 73 yards and one
touch down. The Generals’
defense, led by junior line-
backer Ryan MacPhee, only
allowed one Tiger touch-
down.

comeback after
ﬁrst game defeat

One week after a disappoint-
ing loss to Franklin and Marshall
in its season opener, the Washing-
ton and Lee football team won
its ﬁrst home game 21-7 over the
Sewanee Tigers in front of a vocal
crowd of 1,725.

The Generals’ defense held the
Tigers to a mere 216 yards of total
offense and forced four turnovers.
The result was especially impor-
tant because of last week’s difﬁ-
cult loss to F&M in

the start of the year, behind only
Bridgewater College, currently
ranked tenth in the nation, most
observers expected the Generals
to win through their early games
until their encounter with the
Eagles in Bridgewater on October
28.

While both of their games thus
far were non-conference, and thus
do not affect the ODAC champi-
onship race, players said the loss
was tough all the same, and that it
was important to get a victory in
front of the home fans.

Offensive lineman Charlie
Craigle said that the team didn’t
know exactly what to expect from
F &M, but that afterwards the
Generals thought they could have
pulled out a win.

The Generals’ performance
was less than spectacular against
F&M, and players were looking
for a change in the team’s attitude
before coming back to Lexington
to open their ﬁrst home game.
Against F &M, the team managed
only 128 yards of offense and 11
ﬁrst downs, an overall lackluster
showing from a team coming off
its best season in twenty years.

Women is soccer team shuts out every contender posting ﬂawless record of 4-0

By Mlke Fahey
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee
women’s soccer team has gotten
off to an outstanding start to this
2006 campaign, starting off with
a 4-0 record, while outscoring op-
ponents 24-0.

With victories over two ODAC
conference opponents, the Gener-
als sit poised to make another run
at the ODAC championship. Al-
though the season is only just be-
ginning, W&L slammed ODAC
opponents Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College and Randolph-
Macon by scores of 11-0 and 7-0
respectively.

The Generals have been led
by sophomore forward Anne Van
Devender. Van Devender has
been a force to be reckoned with
on the offensive side of the ﬁeld,
leading the team in scoring with
seven goals and three assists. Van
Devender was also named MVP
of the recent W&L Invitation
tournament held at the start of
September.

“I think we are off to a great
start,” Van Devender said. “We
are starting games stronger and
scoring early goals.”

portive home crowd, the Gener-
als captured the win they thought
they should have had at F&M.
W&L’s offense rarely mis-
ﬁred, and the defense was solid
against a Sewanee offense loaded
with dangerous playmakers like
tailback Blake Mears, named
Southern Collegiate Athletic
Conference Player of the Week
two weeks ago in Sewanee’s 42-
35 win over Hampden-Sydney. In
that game, Mears had 149 yards
rushing. Against the Generals, he
was held to just 49. The offense’s
performance was also markedly

In this past weekend’s con-
test against Randolph-Macon,
the Generals dominated. W&L
was led by junior forward Shana
Oltman’s and Van Devender, who
both tallied a pair of goals.

Junior forward Martha
Caulkins started the Generals’
offensive with her fourth goal of
the season. Senior forward Anne
Wiltshire also tallied a goal and
two assists in the contest.

Caulkins has been stellar for
the Generals, also notching a hat
trick with an assist in the Generals
11-0 victory over Randolph-Ma-
con’s Woman’s College. Caulkins
is the second lead scorer for the
Generals this season with four
goals and an assist on the season
for far.

opposed to the 128 against F&M.

Key to the Generals’ improve-
ment was the play and leader-
ship of senior quarterback Hunter
Dawkins.

“After the F&M loss, Dawkins
realized he needed to be more of
a leader,” said freshman Malcolm
Hines. “He stepped up and we got
the win”.

In addition to Dawkins’ per-
formance, the Generals’ offense
was paced by impressive play by
senior wide receiver Colton Ward
(5 receptions, 76 yards, I touch-

forward Cara Burton have also
been big factors in the Gener-
als offense. Wiltshire has scored
a goal and notched three assists.
Wiltshire ranks second all-time at
W&L in goals scored (43), third
all-time in career points (104) and
ﬁfth all-time with 18 career as-
sists. Burton has scored a pair of
goals on the season so far.

The Generals are a young
team, only having graduated
three seniors in the off-season.
Some freshmen are already mak-
ing a strong impact. Roz Klann

seen lots of playing time, and
both have scored their ﬁrst colle-
giate goals.

While the Sewanee offense
was able to gain yardage on the
Generals’ defense, they were un-
able to score a second touchdown,
converting 9 of 18 times on third

in 2005. Having only graduated
one senior last year, this year’s
defense is unstoppable. For the
start of the season, the Gener-
als have been perfect, posting
four consecutive shutouts.

Senior midﬁelder Maggie
Megear and junior defender
Haley Bunting have led the
defense for the Generals. Both
were all-ODAC selections last
season.

Goalkeeping duties have
been split by two returning
stars, senior veteran Em-
ily Binns and sophomore Kiki
Moreo. Moreo has seen more
playing time, but both athletes
have done outstanding in goal,
not allowing a single goal.

Just four games into the
season, the Generals seem pre-
pared to take on any opponent.

The ladies are off to a great
start and are prepared to take
on conference rivals in pursuit
of an ODAC championship.
The team last won the champi-
onship in 2003.

I think we will continue to
have success,” Van Devender
said. “Virginia Wesleyan this
Saturday will be a real test.”

   Computing Search under dispute 

 

Search begins without faculty from computer science department

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS EDITOR

As Provost Tom Williams

‘ ~ leads the search for a new direc-

tor of University Computing, the
Department of Computer Science

, wants to have its say.

The nine person search com-
mittee, chaired by Williams, does
not include any faculty from the
computer science department.
The only undergraduate faculty
member on the committee is Bob
Ballenger, Associate Professor
for Information Systems in the
Williams School.

Ballenger’s background and
published works make him quali-
ﬁed to serve on the committee,
but Ken Lambert, head of the
computer science department,
noted the lack of faculty from the

college.

When asked if his department
was involved in the search, Lam-
bert said, “No, we’re not.  Not
only are they no computer science
faculty, but there are no faculty
from the College at all.”

Aside from Williams and Bal-
lenger, the following people are
on the search committee: John
Watkins and Dean Tallman from
University Computing, Associ-
ate Dean of the College Elizabeth
Knapp, Associate Registrar Bar-
bara Rowe, Associate Law Dean
John Keyser and University Li-
brarian Merrily Taylor.

Williams said he had consid-
ered adding a member of the com-
puter science department.

“A fully representative c_om—
mittee would be of a size that
would make it difﬁcult to func-

tion,” he said. “When we get a
short list of . candidates ﬁnalized
they will meet with a bigger
group on campus, including stu-
dents and faculty.”

Lambert’s department has four
full-time faculty members and av-
erages between ﬁve and 20 senior
major candidates each year. He
said the department has a national
reputation.

“Our curriculum is second to
none. In the past we’ve been a
member of the Liberal Arts Com-
puting Consortium along with
schools like William and Mary,
Grinnell, Swarthmore, Williams,
and Dartmouth. We have a staff
that publishes in major journals
and we have a National Science
Foundation grant that’s given us a
million dollars in funding.”

Lambert also has published

18 textbooks on introductory
programming for the college and
high school levels.

Though his department is not
represented on the search com-
mittee, Lambert says they have a
strong relationship with Univer-
sity Computing.

“We have a half-time tech sup-
port person that we share with
University Computing’s Instruc-
tional Technology Group. He’s
our liaison to University Comput-
ing, so if we need any further sup-
port he works to obtain that.”

Lambert said University Com-
puting has several outstanding
staff members who have worked
well his department over the
years, but he said his department
“has seen the need to have [their]
own tech support.”

Williams echoed Lambert’s

comments and said he is currently
working on solutions.

“Computer Science needs
dedicated support like Chemistry,
Biology, Geology and Engineer-
ing have.

“Right now they have half-
time so it’s not really Univer-
sity Computing supporting them.
Dean Dobin, Ken Lambert and
I are working to ﬁnd a solution
that’ll support their unique needs
— they’re not dependant on Uni-
versity Computing.

“They have a sub-network
needs dedicated support to serve
their needs.”

Williams said the new direc-
tor will need to understand the
unique perspectives of the law
school, library, Williams School
and computer science department.
The new director will lead a staff
of 31 full-time and four part-time
employees.

“In the last decade the Williams

School has grown in its need for
tech support,” Williams said.

Ruth Floyd, the Acting Direc-
tor of University Computing, said
her department works to keep up
with changes in the industry.

“We look at what’s in use na-
tionwide in higher education and
business — the Williams School
especially is interested in that.”

When Floyd joined the staff
in 1981, the department had four
employees. She now supervises
31 full-time and 4 part-time staff.

Lambert and the computer sci-
ence department will wait to who
the search committee selects.

Though he says the department
has knowledge to contribute for
improvements on the academic
side, the professors have not been
consulted.

“We just feel we’ve got some
expertise that we can contribute
to a search for a new director,”
Lambert said.

The Pope needs

As others talk, 

Why Benedict XVI and his critics should calm down

By Craig Malkmes
C0 LU M NIST

In light of the worldwide reli-
gious tension of not only the past
several years but indeed the past
millennium, the comments issued
by the Pope in his recent speech
at the University of Regensburg
in Germany encompass a mistake
that is wholly inexcusable and, as
many Muslims would agree, ex-
tremely difﬁcult to forgive.

The Pope quoted a 14th-cen-
tury Byzantine emperor who de-
nounced Mohammad’s teachings
and ultimately the teachings of
the Islamic faith. The emperor ac-
cused Mohammed of maintaining
“evil" and “inhumane” principles
and that he commanded followers
of Islam to “spread by the sword
the faith he preached.”

I’ll say up front that I in no
way associate myself with the Is-
lamic faith, and that I am a Chris-
tian. However, studying religions
during college has given me a
certain respect for other faiths
throughout the world, whether
still widely practiced or not. Un-
fortunately, it remains a certain
respect that is, for the most part,
unaccepted by a large majority of
various cultures.

Indeed, it is never acceptable
for one to disrespect a certain re-
ligion and essentially attack its
followers, whether with verbal
deﬁlement or physical violence.

The Pope has since issued a
statement in which he claims that
the words of this Byzantine em-
peror do not reﬂect the actual sen-
timents of the Papacy.

Indeed, it is never acceptable for one to disre-

spect a certain religion and essentially attack

its followers, whether with verbal deﬁlement or

physical violence.

However, the fact remains that
the Pope chose not only to include
the brief quotation in his speech,
but also neglected to question and
ultimately disprove it. To quote
one of my pledge brothers, “. . .
dude, that’s just something you
don’t do.” It is completely inex-
cusable to make such a public
comment as that, whether he em-
braces it or denounces it.

The Pope is certainly not the
only one at fault in this situation;
the reactions of some Muslims
to Benedict’s words are equally
disrespectful and audacious. The
supreme leader of Iran issued a
response to the Pope’s speech in
Germany in which he accuses
the pontiff of planning to launch
a new crusade against Islam, and
says the Pope has been attempting
to incite intense religious fervor.
Many Muslims in Turkey main-
tain that he essentially aims to
revive the crusader spirit within
Christians that was so prevalent
during the medieval ages. Some
Muslims have even attacked sev-
eral churches in retaliation.

Don’t be ridiculous. The Pope
is scheduled to visit Turkey soon,
where he will be surrounded by

Muslims. Surely it was planned
as an extension of peaceful sen-
timent, as the Pope would not be
visiting if he was unwilling to
understand the differing beliefs
as well as the unfamiliar culture
around him.

It is incredibly ignorant for
Americans to hold a feeling of
hatred toward all Muslims as a
result of the heinous acts that
only a miniscule percent of the
Islamic faith commit. It is equally
as ignorant for Muslims to com-
mit these atrocities in the name
of a God who would not condone
them, against people who have
not wronged them.

Remarks that have such po-
tential to incite more religious
tension should remain unvoiced.
Instead, one should respect the
faiths of others, for it is nobody’s
place to comment on what they
misconstrue as ﬂaws in some-
thing they don’t believe in or even
wholly understand. The Native
Americans accepted the fact that
other cultures will have different
religions, and they expected it. I
ﬁnd nothing wrong with this men-
tality.

Where is the respect? 

At a school where admin-
istrators love giving lofty
speeches about student re-
sponsibility, Jason Rodocker
quietly takes action.

After years of confusing
rules and uneven enforce-
ment from the Inter-frater-
nity Council, Rodocker is
working with the IFC to
make sure Greek men across
campus know what is ex-
pected of them.

“I didn’t know the rules”
will not longer be an accept-
able excuse when fraternities
or individuals get themselves
into trouble, and that’s a
change for the better.

In past years, only a hand-
ful of chapter ofﬁcers knew
the rules and expectations of
the IFC, and even those se-
lect few seemed a bit shaky
on the details.

Oﬁicers would some-
times have to check the IFC
Constitution, housing cor-
poration guidelines, lease
agreements, and university
policies to decide how a giv-
en rule worked.

Now everything is being
consolidated into compre-
hensive yet concise guide-

lines.

Rodocker and the IFC
want everyone to be account-
able for the actions of their
houses.

Chapter presidents and
IF C members will no longer
be the only people who un-
derstand the rules.

Instead of simply let-
ting chapter presidents de-
liver messages, Rodocker
has started visiting different
fraternities to explain the
changes.

The IFC wisely met with
sophomore men who are liv-
ing in Greek housing this
year.

At the meeting Rodocker,
IFC President Drew Fla-
nigan and Senior Justice
David Mitchell explained
the expectations and require-
ments of living in fraternity
houses.

Rodocker shiﬁed the bur-
den of responsibility onto all
Greek men, not just a select
few.

These actions don’t mean
everything in the Greek sys-
tem is perfect .

Far from it.

Fraternities

are strug-

Rodocker acts

Staﬂer pours time, energy into thankless job

gling to adjust to Virginia’s
harsh new minor-in-posses-
sion laws and the suddenly
aggressive actions of the
Lexington Police and the
Rockbridge County Sheriff
Departments.

Still, Rodocker, who ar-
rived on campus a year ago,
has wasted little time trying
to improve the W&L frater-
nity system.

The IFC will need to
help fraternities protect their
members as well as freshmen
from arrest.

The new get-tough atti-
tude won’t stop parties, but it
may change how they work.

Each year will bring new
challenges to W&L’s unique
fraternity system, and each
challenge will require cre-
ative solutions.

We can’t vouch for
Rodocker’s creativity, but
we can speak to his commit-
ment.

The lights in his office go
dark at eight p.m. far more
often than they do at ﬁve.

Rodocker is straightening
things out. We like that.

Frankly, we’ll skip the
speeches and take action.

Beer Spillers and Toe Killers need to shape up and watch their step

By Grace Andrews
00 LU M NIST

Today’s topic is respect, or the
lack of it here at Washington and
Lee. Let ’s start with some person-
al stories. Just the other day my
suitemate and I were waiting in
line at the Co-Op when suddenly
a stampede of people came in.
They all somehow didn’t see us
and broke in line. Now, I do know
that I am only 5’3 and a l—lbs.
(my weight is only for God, my
doctor, and myself to know), but
how did they miss me? Last time
I checked, a line usually goes in
one direction and the end is be-
hind the person who was standing
there when you walked in.

Granted, these people could
have been suffering from tempo-
rary blindness, but what are the
chances of all of them going blind
in the same moment and miss-
ing me in my bright Skittle Blue
shirt? That’s right--slim to none!

But my_ problem with the ob-
vious breaking in line was that
none of them apologized or even
looked back to see the angry little
person (me) giving them dirty
glances. They didn’t even care.

It may sound very third-grad-
ish, but I think that breaking in
line is wrong. I try my hardest not
to participate in this sort of devi-
ant behavior. I respect lines and I
know that if someone has had to
wait they deserve to be ahead of
me.

My next complaint is how
some people treat the D-Hall and
Co-Op workers. I can’t even re-
member the number of times that
people have asked a worker in the
D-hall where something was and
used what I call an unacceptable
tone. An unacceptable tone would
sound like the same tone you

would use to talk to a younger
sibling who was caught snooping
in your room. The workers here
are not your personal servants,
and treating them so is wrong.

The most common form of
disrespect I see in these areas are
when people leave trays, cups,
silverware, and even food on the
tables. Now, why in the world
would someone just leave a tray
on the table, or better yet leave so
much trash on the table it looks
like maybe the table was their
tray?

Last year, when I ate in D-
Hall, I would always ﬁnd myself
picking up dirty cups and silver-
ware for other people. The prob-
lem with this is that my name is
not Alfred, and it’s not my job
to clean up for them. If you are
old enough to walk and talk, you
are old enough to clean your own
mess. Last time I checked, no one
here was wearing Pampers or in
need of a bottle.

The other place , that people
leave these sort of messes are in
the dorms. Just the other day my
friends and I saw orange rinds on
the top of the steps right outside of
Gaines. Now, I may be mistaken,
but I don’t think a staircase can be
considered a trash can. Oh yeah,
and that goes for hallways too.

Now, another place that I see
disrespect is on Traveller and at
parties. One of my Taveller mem-
ories involves me at a party being
pushed out of the way by a Small
Person Pusher who was clearly
about 62 or taller. This Pusher
was so eager to get on Traveller
that he had no problem pushing
little 01’ me out of the way to se-
cure his own seat.

Honestly, it was like a scene
from “Godzilla.” Here’s this big
creature picking up something a

million times smaller than him,:
me. The only difference is he
wasn’t that big and I didn’t see
him tossing any cars, picking up
people, or climbing any buildings;
apart from these small differ-
ences, it was just like the movie.
The Pusher can also be seen push-
ing people out of the way at par-
ties. Their ability to walk through
crowds is like Moses’ ability to
part water.

Also at these parties, I have
been attacked by the Beer Spiller
and Toe Killer. The Beer Spiller
is usually a little tipsy and wob-
bles around at parties accidentally
spilling alcohol on the ﬂoor and
whomever is out of their blurred
line of vision. This is usually
me since everyone at this school
seems to be part human, part Jolly
Green Giant.

Next is the Toe Killer. This
is usually the young lady in too-
expensive stilettos who steps
on anything and everything that
moves and almost always seems
to step on your big toe, usually
four or ﬁve times. Sometimes, the
Beer Spiller and Toe Killer are
one and the same. V

The Beer Spiller is a bit like
the Small Person Pusher and Toe
Killer since apologizing isn’t in
their nature. Who cares if you are
tipsy. You should still have the
decency to say “sorry,” or “ex-
cuse me.”

Once again, I must place a dis-
claimer here: If any of what I said
describes and/or offends you, that
is not my goal. BUT if you are of-
fended, I suggest you think about
why.

THE RING-TUM PHI ° 3

. arts&Iile

 

By Julie von Sternberg
STAFF WRITER

If you are looking for inspira-
tion, be at Lee Chapel on Tuesday
to hear U.S. Gymnastic Hall of
F amer Dominique Dawes.

If it’s entertainment you seek,
a stand-up comedy performance
by comedian Tim Young is only a
few days away.

Dawes was invited by the Con-
tact Committee to give a speech
entitled “Success is a Journey,
Not a Description.” The com-
mittee said that Dawes’ words of
wisdom will leave students both
uplifted and motivated.

Young was chosen by the
General Activities Board solely to
bring laughter and entertainment
to Washington and Lee.

Dawes, called “Awesome
Dawesome” by fans, was a mem-
ber Of the U.S. Olympic Gym-
nastics team known as the “Mag-
niﬁcent Seven,” which won Team
Gold in Atlanta in 1996. She also
became the first African American
to win an individual event medal
with her bronze on the ﬂoor ex-
ercise.

This is the first time that Con-
tact has brought an athlete to
speak about his or her career.

In the past, the Committee
has invited political activists like
Ralph Nader, whose discussion
of debatable topics was both ridi-
culed and praised.

“That’s all part of providing
the campus with entertaining, en-
gaging, and relevant speakers,”
said Contact Committee Member
David Kronenfeld.

However, to start the year off
right, the Committee opted for a
speaker that is less controversial.

“We wanted someone who
people from both sides of the
aisle and across a spectrum of ide-
ologies could come together and
enjoy,” said Kronenfeld.

As the current President of the
Women’s Sports Foundation and a
retired Broadway actress, Dawes
is a role model for all young
women. Because of high name
recognition, members of Contact
are expecting a larger than normal
crowd than previous years.

Junior Jenny Sproul teaches
gymnastics in downtown Lexing-
ton and is one of many students
excited about Dawes’ visit.

“I deﬁnitely followed The
Magniﬁcent Seven,” said Sproul.
“I read books about them after the
fact because I was so excited
they’d won the Olympics. I deﬁ-
nitely wanted to be one of them!”

The GAB has the same high
expectations for comedian Tim

Young.

111 the past the GAB has pre-
sented comedy shows such as
“Second City,” which consists of
short “Saturday Night Live” type
skits. This year, the committee
wanted to ﬁnd a fresh and unique
perfonner who would attract a
larger audience.

Young was ﬁrst seen by stu-
dents Katie Cannody, Morgan
Harris, Dominique Lamb, and
Rohan Poojara at the National
Association of Campus Activities
national conference in Boston last
February.

At the NACA conference,
students enjoyed performances
by dozens of musicians, speak-
ers, and comedians including
Josh Blue, the winner, and Ty
Barnett, the 2nd place winner of
“Last Comic Standing.”

After all the performances,
the students unanimously chose
Young.

“He was chosen because he
seemed to have intellectual humor
that the W&L students that saw
him believed would be appreciat-
ed and enjoyed on campus,” said
Jason Rodocker, Director of Stu-
dent Activities & Greek Life.

This week's events:

- Domlnlque Dawes, Sept. 26 at 7:30 p.m. in Lee Chapel (by

Contact)

- Tlm Young, Sept. 28 at 8 p.m. in Keller Theater (by GAB)

 Golden opportunity

Gymnast Dominique Dawes, comedian Tim Young to entertain W&L

In addition, Young charges
a third of the price for a normal
performer, which enables the
GAB to bring two more come-
dians to W&L before the end of
the year.

It is unknown what type of
material Young will present but
the committe is not worried.

“He has a style that could be
enjoyed by anybody - not of-
fensive or obnoxious, just solid
humor,” said Rodocker

Young has gained experience
performing in front of a variety
of audiences, colleges and clubs
all over the United States. He
has even appeared on television
as a performer on Comedy Cen-
tral’s “Premium Blend,” a com-
mentator on El television’s “50
Most Outrageous Moments,”
and a guest star on the cartoon
show “Daria”.

Sophomore. Morgan Harris,
also a stand-up comedian, looks
forward to seeing Young per-
form again. He describes Young
as “an observational comedian
like Jerry Seinfeld, but with a
faster and more crowd-interac-
tive delivery.”

As part of the comedy club,
Harris has performed at two
W&L comedy shows in the
Commons. At this year’s stu-
dent’s activity fair, Harris hap-
pily watched as 100 students
who share his interest for com-
edy signed up for the club.

Frats struggle to
obey IFC orders

Contlnued from page 1

and sorority standards, we
will look to ﬁnd ways to make
the system more effective and
more consistent. The system is
good at face value, but we can-
not begin nor do we want to cod-
ify expectations and guidelines
for all situations.”

Rodocker says the strike
system has led to “tangible, no-
ticeable improvements” but cau-
tions against being “complacent
because we’re better.”

He echoes Flanigan’s com-
mitment to consistency by mak-
ing it a goal this year for the IFC
to “get better at explaining the
logic” behind its actions.

For all parties involved, edu-
cation is paramount. Rodocker
said “educating the chapter
members about policy” is the
most important pillar of the
IFC.

Flanigan’s hope for this year
is “to continually facilitate a bet-
ter understanding of University
policies with a hope that we can
make Greek events safer.”

Over at FIJI, which just came
off its social probation Septem-
ber 21, Rothey is working hand-
in-hand with the IFC towards
the goal of policy awareness.

“We have taken steps to make
sure our brothers know what the
rules actually are. We had Jason

come to our ﬁrst chapter meeting
this year to clear up any confu-
sion that existed Over our strike
situation and social probation,”
Rothey said.

He points to years of unwrit-
ten and often unenforced rules as
a major stumbling block to educa-
tion, but credits Rodocker and the
IFC for having taken “large steps
to clear up misunderstandings,
such as clarifying the IFC Consti-
tution and Grand Chapter Meet-
ings to start every semester.”

For Rodocker, it’s all part of
the job. Education is important,
he maintains, because the Greek
system is important.

“The University has student
issues with potential Greek solu-
tions,” he says. “Greek organiza-
tions are based on good values
and concepts and if members un-
derstand those values, it will help
lessen student issues.”

THE RING-TUM PHI - 5

By Joel Poelhuls
su r r w RITE R

If football were a business, the
lineman would be the blue collar
workers. Though they do the dirty
jobs, heavy lifting and form the
core of any team, you are unlikely
to hear their names called in the
stadium nor mentioned in the
Monday paper. Of course, any-

one associated with

9°°|'° the game knows the
W&L 21 importance of this
Sewanee 7 group-

Thus, a season
as successful as the
Generals’ last (the winningest in
20 years) is largely attributable
to the strength of their line. This
year’s team returns ﬁve play-
ers with signiﬁcant experience
from last year: Left tackle Bob
Hetherington (Jr.), left guard Dan
Felezzola (Jr.), right tackle Alex
Skotnicki (Jr.), center Chas Col-
lins (Sr.), and right guard Hunter
Whitﬁeld (Sr.), a team captain
who earned ﬁrst team all-confer-
ence honors.

Subs are kept to a minimum so
the ﬁve get used to each others’
presence on the ﬁeld.

“It’s good to know what ev-
erybody’s going to do before the
play,” Felezzola said.

The line is also close oﬂ" the
ﬁeld, going out to eat together ev-
ery Wednesday night.

With expectations high, prepa-
ration must correspond. The team
holds winter workouts and spring
practice before giving the individ-

ual players workout assignments '

for the summer.
Football is time consuming,
and Division III schools do not

provide athletic scholarships.
What then is the motivation for
playing?

“The love of the game,” Whit-
ﬁeld said, “And of course for all
the ladies.”

“Pretty much the credit goes to
our coach, Gavin Colliton,” Col-
lins said. “He’s made us the men
we are.”

So far the hard work has been
paying off as the team is off to a
2-1 start, defeating Centre 24-15
on Saturday.

“It’s nice to be able to play
when you’re ahead like that,”
Felazzola said.

The Generals led for most of
the game, which included a fourth
quarter deluge that left the ﬁeld
and players muddy. The rain was
so thick it was difﬁcult to see.

Offensive linemen have very
few personal statistics; the team’s
perfonnance is the reﬂection of
their performance as a unit. One
particular number the group keeps
their eyes on is the sack total.

“We didn’t allow many sacks
last year, and that’s something
we’d like to continue,” Felezzola
said.

Contrary to the popular im-
age of the “dumb jock,” offen-
sive linemen have some of the
most mentally challenging re-
sponsibilities of the game. They
must memorize diverse blocking
schemes and apply them in short
order to an ever-shifting defense.

The Generals have a fairly small
offensive line, with no player ap-
proaching the 300 pound mark,
meaning they are oﬁen outsized
by their opponents.

But as Felezzola explains,
there are more important charac-
teristic than size.

“Coach Colliton works with us
a lot on technique so we always
know what to do. We’re also pret-
ty fast.”

This speed and discipline al-
lows the Generals to execute
plays from the shotgun without a
huddle, keeping the defense on its
heels and giving the smaller of-
fensive line the edge.

“We like to run the inside/out-
side zone if we really need a ﬁrst
down,” Felezzola said.

Collins explained the concept.
“In zone blocking everyone is as-
signed to a gap rather than a man,
so we know our steps before the
snap.” For a running back with
good vision, this scheme can open
up multiple lanes for cutbacks.
The team also runs an array of

Line unappreciated

Offensive core largely contributes to Generals ’

wild success

and both the line and the team
in general will have plenty of
time to work on their goals.

Some of these, according to
F elezzola, are keeping sacks
low, focusing on every game
one at a time, and not thinking
too far ahead. However he does
concede that the conference
match up with Bridgewater
will be especially signiﬁcant.

It has been said that football
can be reduced to two basic
parts: blocking and tackling.
The difference between the two
on any given play is fought in
the trenches.

This is the aspect of football
that makes it different from any
other sport: players physically
clearing the way for their team-
mates’ success.

So next time you I attend
a football game, gasp at the
amazing catches, the precision
passes, and the spectacular in-
terceptions, but also remember
to take note of the subtleties of
the line. Your football experi-
ence will be all the better for
it.

Soccer wipes out opponents

Men continue undefeated quest, shut out Bridgewater Hampden-Sydney

By Mlke Fahey
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee
men’s soccer team continued its
dominance over every team it en-
countered, adding two wins this
week to take their record to 6-0.

This is the best start that the
team has had since 2000. The
Generals captured their ﬁﬂh win
over Bridgewater College, 2-0.
W&L had not defeated Bridge-
water since 2001. The Generals
scored their six win of the season
with a 4-0 victory over Hampden-
Sydney.

On Saturday morning, the
Generals got off to a strong start
when junior forward and lead-
ing scorer Jack Palmer scored
off an assist from senior forward
Kyle Garcia. The Generals then
notched three goals in the second
half to put away the Tigers.

Sophomore midﬁelder Tommy
Pignatelli and sophomore mid-
ﬁelder John Lindsay both found

the back of the net for the Gen-
erals, and freshman midﬁelder
Drew Crowley scored his third
goal of the season off a pass from
senior midﬁelder Shep Russell.

Junior goaltender Ted Sheddy
notched his third shutout of the
season tallying ﬁve saves. Sheddy
is a veteran goalie for the Gener-
als, having recorded a record of
7-4-2 and posting a GAA of just
0.93 with a .780 save percentage
last season. This season, Sheddy
has been a force to be reckoned
with a GAA of 0.20 and a .938
save percentage. Sheddy has also
recorded 15 saves so far.

The Generals contest against
Bridgewater game started 05 as
a defensive battle, until the 39th
minute when Crowley scored his
second collegiate goal off a pass
from senior defender Scott Pitt-
man.

The Generals carried their mo-
menmm into the half, with a 1-0
lead. Garcia notched the Gener-
als’ second goal of the game off

an assist from junior midﬁelder
Josh Dodds. Garcia’s goal served
as insurance for the rest of the
game, and the Generals never let
Bridgewater get into the contest.

The Generals have gotten off
to their great start behind leading
scorer Palmer. Palmer has scored
six goals so far this season, while
Crowley and sophomore mid-
ﬁelder Whitt Larkin have been the
Generals second leading scorers
so far recording three goals and
an assist. Palmer led the team in
scoring last season with 11 goals
and 2 assists. He was also named
as a First Team All-ODAC selec-
tion.

Another strong force for
the Generals has been their
defense. All three of the senior
captains are defenders, indicat-
ing the Generals’ backﬁeld is
ﬁlled with skilled veterans. Se-
nior captains JD. McDermott,
Alex Phillips and Scot Pitt-
man have all had a great start
to their season, as the Generals
have only allowed an astonish-
ing two goals as a team.

The Generals will take the
ﬁeld to continue their quest for
an undefeated season on Tues-
day, when the take on non-con-
ference opponent Mary Wash-
ington at 4 p.m. on Watt Field.

Howard avoids juicy temptations

By Adam Lewls
STAFF WRITER

New Home Run Champ?

Okay, so it’s mid-September,
and if you’re not engrossed in the
thrill of preseason hockey, you
are most likely focused on foot-

ball, both
NCAA and
NFL. And
while both

sports are off
to exciting
starts, one
can’t help
but notice
that baseball
is still in full
force, and amidst an intense NL
Wild Card race, one Ryan How-
ard is emerging as an MVP candi-
date, with 57 home runs through
149 games.

“So what?” you may say.
“Fiﬁy-seven home runs with two
weeks leﬁ? Big deal. Didn’t
Bany, Mark, and Sammy have,
like, 65 by now?” And yes, that
would be correct. But before you
go back to watching the Canucks
battle the Flames, let’s take a bet-
ter look at this.

Let us begin with Barry Bonds.
If you have kept up with news and
evidence surrounding Bonds, you
will know that he shares the same
slogan as Juicy Juicem (“100%
Juice”). Okay, maybe that was
speculation, as it has not been
“proven” that he knowingly took
steroids (other than “The Cream”
and “The Clear” of course). Then
let me say, using political correct-
ness, that there has been much
controversy surrounding Bonds
involving his alleged use of per-
formance enhancing drugs. Blah
blah blah. No matter which way
you look at it, somehow at age
37, Bonds’ head randomly grew
one full size and his body made
the Hulk’s look average. So, for
arg1ment’s sake, I am assuming
he did a little more than alter his
diet and work out routine, and
thus temporarily erasing his 73
home run season from the record
books.

Next, we have Mark McGwire.
His case is simple. In 1998, when
he broke Maris’ record of 61 home
runs (for the ﬁrst time), he admit-

 

ted to using Androstenedione,
which is a dietary drug that had
been banned by the NFL already,
despite not yet being prohibited
by the MLB. With that said, it is
now clear that whether the drug
was illegal or not at that time, it
signiﬁcantly enhanced one’s per-
formance, thus, I will again tem-
porarily remove his marks of 70
home runs in 1998, and 65 home
runs in 1999.

Lastly, we have “Slammin’”
Sammy Sosa, who broke Maris’
record three times. When the
steroid scandals began to leak
out, his name was one of the ﬁrst
to be circulated, along with the
other afore-mentioned sluggers.
Though we cannot be sure wheth-
er he used performance enhancers,
a dramatic decline in his power
totals following the scandals may
indicate that he did. Additionally,
he was involved in the infamous

.“corked bat incident,” which says

enough on his potential to cheat,
and as a result, let’s say good—bye
to the 66, 64, 63 home runs sea-
sons he put up.

So what does this leave us
with? Well, besides the fact that
we have three players whose bi-
ceps have their own zip codes,
we also are left with a Mr. Ryan
Howard and his 57 home runs.
Granted, he still must hit four
more to tie Maris, but for the sake
of arguing, let’s assume he reach-
es and surpasses that point.

In the minds of most baseball
fans, a deﬁnite certainty is needed
for them to discount statistics,
especially those of the game’s
greatest sluggers. And that in it-
self makes it very difficult to sud-
denly erase records, or even place
an asterisk next to them. So with
that in mind, I am not asking you
to pretend that Bonds, McGwire,
and Sosa didn’t squash Maris’
record (with their juiced up bot-
toms), but rather I am asking you
to merely consider the evidential
support, and then see the new re-
sult.

Ladies and gentlemen, I am
proud to announce to you the (po-
tential) new single season home
run champ: Ryan Howard.

(Well, at least until they start
testing for human growth hor-
mones).

Volleyball struggles at Emory

The Generals ended their play
at the Emory Invitational last
weekend in Atlanta, Ga. 1-3.

Alter early success on Friday
against Rockford College 3-0

op“; (30-22, 30-24, 30-
reeom 23), the Generals fell
3_1 to opponents from

Emory University on
Friday and Carthage
College and Randolph—Macon
College on Saturday.

Against all three contenders,
the Generals did not secure a sin-
gle match.

The closest game came on
Saturday aftemoon against Ran-
doph-Macon with scores of 25-
30, 25-30 and 27-30. This was
the ﬁrst ODAC loss this season
that adjusted their ODAC record
to 3-1.

With only two seniors and two
juniors, the young volleyball team
has overcome a disadvantage in
experience, already winning eight
of its 12 games.

“There are quite a few new
people ﬁlling starting positions,”
senior captain Ashley Hurt said.
“Our play has improved since we

One reason for their strong
record is the enthusiasm and sup-
port of the senior captains.

“The senior captains encour-
age and push every player to be
the best they can be,” freshman
Rachael Phillips said. “Even if we
made a mistake, they cheer us on
and give us conﬁdence.”

According to Phillips, the
freshmen bring new possibilities
and ideas to the team.

“The freshmen have really
brought a lot of energy to the team

whether they are on the court or
not,” Hurt said.

“It is great to have a bunch of
girls excited to be at W&L and
be playing volleyball. I think we
have eight people who, with some
training and experience, have the
potential to ﬁll big roles in their
careers at W&L.”

A large number of underclass-
man players gives the team has a
deep bench advantage.

“We’ve got a lot of depth,”
freshman Aleisha Thornsberry

said. “Seventeen girls is a really
big volleyball team, and it allows
us a lot of choices when we get
into tight situations.”

The team looks to win the
ODAC Championship.

Last year, the women qualiﬁed"

for the NCAA tournament falling
in the ﬁrst round to contenders
from Southwestern University.

ODACS,” Hurt said. “We want to

EDlTOR—|N-CHIEF

The Rockbridge County Board of
Supervisors have put off voting on a

’ proposed noise ordinance—for now.

The proposal, which includes pro-
visions for a permitting system and
litter pickup, was set aside at the su-
pervisor’s meeting Monday, Sept. 25.

The debate over the ordinance
stems from a dispute between the
students living in the Pole Houses
on Furrs Mill Road and Windfall on
Greenhouse Road.

Several neighbors at the meeting
complained openly about the noise
from student parties, saying that it has
disrupted their lives.

“It’s not that big a deal~until you
have to live with it,” said Cindy Wise-
man, a Hunter Hill resident.

She said that students yelling, loud
music, and even the noise from the
Traveller buses all make her nights
miserable.

Wiseman said that neighbors have
to deal with noise from student parties
late into the night, which is especially
hard because she has to wake up early

for work. .

Some have even resorted to taking
out hotel rooms for the night to hide
from the noise, Wiseman said.

The neighbors say they want the

ordinance to help protect them from"

the students’ partying.

“If we have the ordinance in place,
at least we would have something we
could work with and use," Wiseman
said.

Sheritf Bob Day, who spoke at the
meeting, said he wanted the board to
hold off on their vote until the three
county noise ordinance charges for the
month of September went to court.

All three charges were against
Washington and Lee students. Two of
them, John Parker and Matthew Leis-
man, pleaded guilty to the charges on
Wednesday, Sept. 27. 1

Both men were ticketed at the
same house, but on different consecu-
tive nights.

Sgt. Hugh Ferguson said both men
were polite and understanding about
the situation.

They will each have to pay court
costs and were ﬁned $50.

But both men now have misde-

meanor chznges on their records. . .

Senior David Olchowski was also
charged with violating the noise ordi-
nance earlier this month.

He pleaded no contest, he said,
because he had tried to stop the party
when the ofﬁcer warned him.

If his house has no more problems
until Dec. 19. the violation will be
dropped from his record.

Neighbors say that isn’t enough.

“That’s all the judge is going to
dofslap them on the hand," Wise-
man said.

The university has made some
strides to try and close the gap between
the students and the community.

Dawn Watkins, dean of students,
and Jane Horton, director of student
health, launched the Campus-Com-
munity Coalition last year.

The coalition was started to help
students and their neighbors come to
understand each other, said Watkins.

“The problem was that no one was
talking to each other,” she said.

Watkins and Horton recruited
neighbors with ﬂyers, and the coali-

Freshmen get a bit
gooﬁz to win votes

By Wesley 0’DeIl
STAFF WRITER

ashington and Lee’s
campus has been a bit
more colorful despite

the construction work for the past
few weeks, as signs bearing slo-
gans like “Pick Corn” and “James
Dick: He’s got BIG plans” have
appeared on pretty much any sur-
face to which tape will adhere.

The ground itself has even be-
come an advertising medium for a
certain “Kiwi.”

Freshman elections never fail
to entertain.

The class of 2010 voted last
week to select their class presi-
dent and their representatives to
the EC‘and SJC. Elections held
Monday pitted no fewer than 25
candidates against each other in
elections for three diﬂerent posts.
The large number of candidates
forced two runoff elections which
were held on Wednesday and Fri-
day. Voting Regulations Board
Co-Chair Kathleen Morphis said
the ﬁerce competition and high
voter tumout — in the 70%-range
— “indicates the eagerness of [the
class of 20 10] to become an active
part of the W&L community.”

The ﬁnal tally of the votes was
not available as of press time.

While the run-offs may be
typical of freshmen elections,
this year’s contest was atypical
in the campaigning methods the
candidates employed. In addition
to the customary posters and not-
so-customary chalk, several EC
candidates participated in a forum
with their potential constituents
in the BDG quad on the Saturday
before the elections.

For over an hour, candidates
Abel Delgado, Daniel Haycraﬁ,
Elizabeth Micci, Elliot O’Brien,
and James Dick gave prepared
opening and closing remarks and
also took questions from an audi-
ence numbering over 30 students.

  Schools prepare for comingflu

Health experts and administrators at W&L and VMI are preparing for a possible bird ﬂu pandemic

 

By Dane Davls
STAFF WRITER

As health officials and com-
munity leaders around the country
prepare for a possible pandemic
ﬂu outbreak, Washington and Lee
is getting ready, too.

W&L’s Ofﬁce of the Provost
and the Deans Academic Speak-
ers Program at the Virginia Mili-
tary Institute are hosting an open
discussion on ramiﬁcations of an
inﬂuenza pandemic.

Pandemic ﬂu can be devastat-
ing. The last great pandemic, the
Spanish Flu outbreak of 1918,
lasted for only 18 months but
caused the deaths of at least 50
million people. The inﬂuenza pan-
demics of 1957 and 1968 killed
2.7 million people. The worry of
a ﬂu pandemic is so great that the
U.S. Congress has appropriated
2.3 billion dollars for pandemic

readiness.

The attention now being paid
to the possibility of ﬂu pandem-
ic is largely due to the rise of
the inﬂuenza virus H5N1, more
commonly known as “bird ﬂu.”
The H5N1 strain is a new inﬂu-
enza subtype, ﬁrst causing human
deaths in Hong Kong, China in
1997.

This new strain has caused
over 200 human deaths. Current-
ly, it can only be contracted if a
person closely handles a bird car-
rying the virus.

The greatest concern is that
the virus may mutate into a high-
ly transmissible human form, in-
stigating another inﬂuenza pan-
demic. Estimates from the United
Nations place possible death tolls
for a H5N1 outbreak between 5
and 150 million people.

All of the information concern-
ing an inﬂuenza pandemic begs

the question ~ is W&L ready?
Jane Horton, director of the Stu-
dent Health Center. says the uni-
versity is not fully prepared. She
also said schools and institutions
around the country are also still in
the planning stages

Since pandemic ﬂu only re-
cently became a pressing issue,
authorities made few major prep-
arations. The possibility of an
outbreak has prompted authori-
ties to begin preparations for an
outbreak.

In conjunction with VMI and
local health authorities, W&L has
begun to develop a plan of prepa-
ration and action to deal with an
inﬂuenza pandemic.

The plan, still in draft form,
takes a multi-level approach to
dealing with an outbreak. Differ-
ent degrees of pandemic severity
would yield different responses
from the university. For example,

if the pandemic strain were dis-
covered in the region, the univer-
sity would begin stockpiling food,
supplies, and vaccinations.

Details concerning how much
should be stockpiled and when
to act have yet to be answered.
Decisions on stockpiling are
expensive, considering the im-
mense cost of vaccinations and
other goods. Dr. David Copeland,
VMI’s physician, states: “We of-
fer ﬂu shot every year and that
costs about $10 per shot. Prepar-
ing for a devastating pandemic ﬂu
is another matter. If we follow
all the federal guidelines, it could
cost tens of thousands of dollars
to prepare for it.”

The open forum is titled “Pan-
demic Inﬂuenza: Ethics, Law,
and the Public’s Health” Guest
speaker Lawrence 0. Gostin, JD,
LLD will discusses how to make
difﬁcult ethical choices when

posed with the scenario of a ﬂu
pandemic. Questions concerning
who receives vaccinations, how
quarantine should be handled,
how much aid can be expected
from state and federal govem-
ment, and l1ow to avoid facility
overload.

Ultimately inﬂuenza pandemic
preparation is an individual effort.
Dr. Horton stresses the need for
awareness, communication, and
education. Basic practices, such
as washing one’s hands, can go a
long way to stopping the spread
of the virus. If a pandemic does
occur, following guidelines and
cooperating with medical authori-
ties will improve the situation for
everyone.

A ﬂu pandemic in the next
generation is considered almost
inevitable. Dr. Horton and Dr. Co-
peland are vigorously preparing
their schools for that eventuality.

arly decision stays for now

Harvard is dropping its early admissions program, but W&L and schools may not follow their lead

By Cody Beauchamp
STAFF WRITER

Harvard University is hop-
ing to see early admissions pro-
grams disappear from the world
of college admissions.

In a bold move that grabbed
the attention of institutions na-
tionwide, the Ivy-league icon
announced Sept. 12 that it would
be doing away with its own Ear-
ly Action program starting for
applicants to the class of 2012.

“The college admissions pro-
cess has become too pressured,
too complex, and too vulnerable
to public cynicism,” said Har-
vard’s interim President Derek
Bok in a statement released on
Harvard’s website.

Bok cited speciﬁc concerns
that programs such as Early
Action (“EA”) and the binding
Early Decision (“ED”) tend to
“advantage the advantaged,”
a reference to one of the most
common criticisms of EA / ED
programs.

The “advantages the advan-
taged” concept argues that EA
and ED programs put students
from poor and rural back-
grounds at a disadvantage when
compared against typically
wealthier students attending re-
source and counseling—rich elite
high schools.

The crux of the argument is
that these “disadvantaged” stu-
dents do not have the necessary
coaching to get in to colleges
during the EA / ED acceptance
cycles, when many colleges
will ﬁll a large portion the slots
available in their incoming
class. More privileged students
often have better access to sup-
port and coaching.

Bok also pointed out that
binding ED programs eliminate
the ability for poorer students to
compare ﬁnancial aid packages
between various institutions,
which potentially forces com-
mitted students to go with less
aid.

Harvard’s decision launched
a wave of debate on the nature
of admissions practices for top
colleges.

The debate only intensiﬁed
following Princeton University
and the University of Virginia’s
recent decisions to follow Har-
vard’s lead and do away with
their programs last Monday.

However, many College Ad-
missions Directors are urging
caution.

Vanderbilt Dean of Admis-
sions Dr. Douglas L. Christian-
sen said, “If Harvard, Princeton
and UVA can switch, I applaud
them for that.”

But, said Christiansen, “what

JACOB SPENCER, W&L admlsslons counselor

 

we’re all trying to look at is how
do we ensure that all students
have accessibility to the most
competitive institutions in the
US?

“We need to ensure that
people from high schools where
college counseling isn’t strong
don’t get hurt in the process of
applying because of early ad-
missions programs.”

Washington and Lee Admis-
sions Counselor ‘Jacob Spen-
cer said he thinks “that other
schools are going to have to take
a look at their Early Admissions
programs and see if they work
in their particular situations.

“I don’t think other schools
are simply going to look at Har-
vard and hop on some band-
wagon.”

Spencer said that he didn’t
believe early admissions pro-
grams were likely to be dropped

The proposed
noise ordinance:

- bans noise disturbances
between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.
Sunday through Thursday and
between 12 a.m. and 7 a.m.
on Friday and Saturday.

- requires a $10 permit,
which lists the location, time,
number of guests, parking,
and the person responsible.

- includes a provision
requiring litter be picked up
by 9 a.m. the following day.

- deﬁnes a gathering of 30
or more people not entirely
enclosed indoors a “large
party public nuisance." It
used to be 15 people, but
the rule was changed so that
some county family functions
would be excluded.

- denies a permit to any
location that has violated the
noise ordinance more than
three times.

- sets the punishment for

a ﬁrst offense as a Class 3
Misdemeanor. The second
offense is a Class 2, and

the third is a Class 1—which
could lead to up to a year in V
jail.

tion eventually included
membership from sheriff’s
deputies and student leaders.

Watkins said students living
in problem areas were disinter-
ested in the project, but several
students on Windfall Hill said
they had never heard of it.

Watkins said that the uni-
versity started the project in
response to pressure from the
community, but that the school
could not control off-campus
life.

“We’re not saying, ‘Don’t
have a party,’” she said. “We
just want to have them put
some guidelines in place.”

Watkins and Horton wrote a
letter to the supervisors in June
suggesting several changes to
the current noise ordinance—
many of which were included
in Monday’s proposal.

In their letter, they said,
“Complaints by private citizens
that do not result in formal cita-
tions are nearly impossible for
the university to handle effec-
tively.”

They pointed out that a per-
mit system would allow the
university to handle the com-
plaints through the Student Ju-
dicial Board.

“This has been an incred-
ible lesson in local gov-
ernment,” Watkins said.
But, she said the university is
trying not to get involved.

“There’s this perception
that the university is cracking
down,” she said. “We’re just
trying to mediate.”

The coalition has not yet
met this, year, because partici-
 and

 i'aned.i

At the meeting Monday,
Harvey Hotinger said that the
work the university was do-

ing “didn’t amount to a hill of
beans.” ‘

Hotinger is the representa-
tive from Kerr’s Creek, the dis-
trict where both the Pole Houses
and Windfall Hill are located.

Sheriff Day said that if the
ordinance passes, his office is
going to be tougher on student
parties.

“We’re going to be doing a
lot more enforcing,” he said.

He said that he and his depu-
ties are responding to the grow-
ing pressure from the commu-
nity.

His ofﬁce has seen a lot
more complaints from citizens,
he said.

Day said that the decision on
the noise ordinance is up to the
students.

If students would be good
neighbors and obey the law, the
problems would go away, he
said.

Olchowski, who lives on
Windfall Hill, said he wants his
neighbors to approach him be-
fore calling the sheriff to com-
plain.

“We’re doing everything
we can to keep the parties low-
key,” he said.

Some neighbors said that
they feel the students can work
the problems out themselves.

Glenn Sager and Ed Bauer,
who both live in houses near
Windfall, said they did not want
to see laws passed exclusively
against students.

“The last thing we want is
more laws,” Bauer said.

Sager said that if the stu-
dents got together and tried to
understand their neighbors, the
tension between the community
and the students would lessen.

“I think there are enough
sensitive young people out
there,” he said.

“I have faith in them.”

at W&L anytime soon.

W&L has the binding Early
Decision program only.

“There are, needless to say,
a lot of traditions here that we
hold very dear, and it’s very nice
to have nucleus of students in
every class who understand and
cherish those traditions,” said
Spencer. “Early decision gives
us that core because it shows
us the students who genuinely
want to be here and want to be a
part of keeping those traditions
alive.”

W&L is not alone in this

regard; interviews with admis-.

sions offers from schools na-

tionwide all reﬂected a common

attitude of “wait and see.”
Some institutions are uncom-

‘ fortable with the philosophy of

Harvard’s decision.
Dave Wottle, Dean of Ad-
missions at Rhodes College,

said “Every school has the right
to make a statement by their
actions  to say, through their
actions, that they have philo-
sophical problems with early
programs because they place
some applicants at a disadvan-
tage in the admission process.”

But, continued Wottle, “that
doesn’t mean that all other
schools share that same belief
and that they must, or should, or
will follow suit.”

Wottle also had difﬁculty
understanding one rationale be-
hind Harvard’s decision.

“I would question whether a
school with an acceptance rate
of only about 10% can signiﬁ-
cantly reduce the stress associ-
ated with the selection process
by simply eliminating its early
admissions program,” said Wot-
tle.

Still, Harvard’s actions — and
Princeton and UVA’s response
— have set admissions ofﬁces
across the nation to work on
evaluating their early admis-
sions programs, W&L included.

“I know that Dean Hartog,
Provost Williams and Presi-
dent Ruscio will be meeting
in the coming year to consider
the state of Early Decision at
W&L,” said Spencer.

“I’m sure they will consider
input from the Board of Trust-

ees and others.”

Still, many admissions offi-
cers doubt that, despite the fresh
scrutiny, early admissions pro-
grams will suddenly be elimi-
nated.

Said Spencer, “Harvard is in
a very different position from
other schools in the country in
regard to admissions.”

“What’s right for Harvard
may not be right for everyone
else,” said Wottle.

“The popular press has a
tendency to ﬁxate on the hand-
ful of ‘Ivy League’ schools and
think that what they do can or
should be transposed onto the
Vast majority of other selective
institutions, and that’s just not
the case. [But] what works for
the Harvards and the Princetons
and the UVAs may not be what
is best for every institution, or
for their students.”

“Can there be abuses?”
Vanderbilt’s Dean Christiansen
said.

“Of course. But what’s im-
portant is that each institution
look at the programs they have
in place and ask themselves
what can be done to ensure that
any student who is qualiﬁed,
who does want the education
the institution provides, gets it
regardless of background.”

Candy for Votes
at election time

continued from page 1
Freshman Zaq Lawal
moderated.

Candidates discussed a
wide variety of topics, from
codiﬁcation of Honor Viola-
tions to complaints about EC
secrecy. The candidates advo-
cated for some serious depar-
tures from standard practice,
including candidate Elliot
“Kiwi” O’Brien’s call for a
transparent budget process
in the distribution of ﬁmds to
student organizations. All the
candidates agreed that forms
of sexual assault should be
considered an honor viola-
tion.

Upperclassmen present
were impressed with the de-
bate for this often issueless
race, which was organized
and sponsored by the can-
didates themselves through
campus notices and Facebook
messages.

“I have not seen anything
like this before. [This is] the
most dialogue [in a student
election] in four years,” said
Head Dorm Counselor Sam
Wilmoth, who commended
the candidates “for being can-
didates instead of just making
posters.”

The forum highlighted an
unusual facet of student elec-
tions: issues. Said “Kiwi”
O’Brien of the audience at
the forum, “their questions
were insightful and really
challenged the candidates
to explain their positions 
at the beginning of the elec-

Its hard to claim, ‘I am going to do this or
that if elected, ’ because almost everything

tion process I think there was a
feeling that there weren’t any
issues. Now I’m impressed by
the number of freshman talking
about them.”

O’Brien’s calls for change
in the EC budget process and
in how the University handles
sexual assault have sparked
controversy.

Said O’Brien’s opponent in
Friday’s runoff, John Twomey,
“the uniqueness of the Execu-
tive Committee position hin-
ders what would commonly be
referred to as a platform...it’s
hard to claim, ‘I am going to do
this or that if elected,’ because
almost everything is reviewed
on a case—by-case basis.”

Of course, debates aren’t the
only way of winning votes; SJC
candidate James Wolff was spot-
ted making his rounds around
the freshmen dorms Thursday
night handing out handshakes in
addition to candy from a large
bucket.

For many freshmen, the
game is still all about name
recognition. Freshman Kelsey
Walsh, who attended the Satur-
day forum, said people for the
most part still “vote for who
they know.”

Twomey is betting his
campaign on just that.
“Talking to people at the
d-hall, in—between class, or
just walking around cam-
pus makes it possible for
me to actually convince
people I am the right can-
didate,” he said.

Regardless of which
strategy brings victory, the
candidates have been uni-
form in their praise of their
supporters and the class as
a whole.

Said O’Brien, “[those
who have] discussed ideas
and issues with me, worn
my shirts, taken up chalk
and attended debates and
speeches are the ones who
have made this election
process so productive and
fun.”

The Voting Regulation
Board’s Morphis concurs,
saying “the candidates
have deﬁnitely worked
hard to get their names
out there, and I think it has
been a good experience for
the class to come together
and think about what they
would like to see happen
for the year.”

Hating Hugo

Tired of listening to Hugo Chavez? Use less 01'].

By Dylan Merrlll
co LUM msr

For the past couple of weeks,
the national media has been ra-
bidly reporting on the vituperative
remarks that Hugo Chavez deliv-
ered to the U.N. General Assem-
bly on Sept. 20. The Venezuelan
president fervently waved a Noam
Chomsky book as he commented
on President Bush’s recent pres-
ence at the same rostrum.

“Yesterday, the devil came
here,” noted the avid critic of the
Bush administration, adding that
the podium “smells of sulfur.”
Chavez then made the sign of the
cross and prayed silently to him-
self, making sure that all of the at-
tendees were aware of his piety. I
guess the two presidents do have
some things in common...

Needless to say, media up-
roar ensued. Many journalists
pounced at the prospect of report-
ing on the hostile language di-
rected toward President Bush, es-
pecially because the criticism was
so overblown and scandalous.
Obviously, Chavez was guilty of
ﬁrst-degree exaggerated rhetoric.
Even bleeding-heart liberals like
me don ’t think George Bush came
from Hell. Maybe Purgatory, but
deﬁnitely not Hell.

President Bush himself has
been known to use extreme rheto-
ric to label his enemies. Both
parties have unabashedly used
ﬁre and brimstone politics to their
advantage.

Unsurprisingly, some ra-
bid Bush supporters have been
foaming at the mouth at the op-

portunity to chastise Venezuelan
president for his remarks. His
comments were blatantly disgust-
ing. How could someone come to
our country and say whatever he
wishes? Can’t we do something
about this?

Bush advocates can eas-
ily discard Chavez’s exagger-
ated remarks by arrogantly noting
George W’s lack of Satan-afﬁli-
ated anatomical parts. Where are
those spiky devil horns, they may
ask? Wouldn’t we see his forked
tongue hanging out as he struggles
to answer a tough question?

Quite obviously, the podium’s
sulfuric smell must have come
from something other than Presi-
dent Bush. It was probably that
Noam Chomsky book that the
Venezuelan president was waving
so furiously. Or maybe Chavez
had egg salad for lunch.

In all seriousness, though, if
Chavez’s comments seemed a lit-
tle too close to home, they were.
New York is a much closer venue
for criticism than the oil ﬁelds
of Venezuela or the caves of Af-
ghanistan. Perhaps the United
States is still not accustomed to
such a local threat, even after the
attacks of 9/ l 1.

This close proximity, coupled
with the exalted position of the
United Nations stage, has induced
quite a bit of trepidation for many
Americans that worry about the
security of the country’s foreign
policy.

Frankly, I’m very frightened
by the hostility that America’s
business partner has brought
to our nation. Venezuela is the
fourth largest producer of foreign

oil in the world; unfortunately,
our country absolutely must have
Chavez’s cooperation. This gives
him theability to hold American
foreign policy hostage and to con-
form the United States’ energy
status to his wishes.

Regrettably, our nation has
been held captive too long by
countries that are only our allies
because their oil supply is so vast.
If North Korea struck it big and
suddenly had a huge supply of
Texas tea, do you think we would
continue to criticize their nuclear
proliferation so aggressively?

We haven’t converted to an
alternative energy source because
we ﬁnd it “too hard” to make the
transition. As Americans, it is
both unpatriotic and irresponsible
to compromise our values for the
sake of maintaining the status
quo.

Members of Congress from
both sides of the aisle have start-
ed to realize the extent to which
America’s energy security is en-
dangered. Senator Richard Lugar
(R-Ind.) has repeatedly comment-
ed on the energy problem and
how it has become the “albatross
of U.S. national security.”

We cannot claim independence
from the inﬂuence of rogue coun-
tries until our country’s livelihood
is no longer contingent upon their
cooperation.

Alternative energy sources
have been researched exhaustive-
Iy, and their potential is promis-
ing. It is up to the American peo-
ple to support the government and
push for a better country, a nation
that is secure and independent of
the inﬂuence of our enemies.

Noise distortion

Community and students need to work this out

Last Monday, members of
the community gathered in
public and tore Washington and
Lee students to bits.

They talked about how we
are inconsiderate neighbors and
how we are slowly mining their
property values and their lives.

They trashed us.

What doesn’t make sense is
that we are supposed to be ex-
emplary citizens. We are great
athletes and compassionate vol-
unteers. We are supposed to be
ladies and gentlemen.

But at the Board of Supervi-
sors meeting, we were a bunch
of drunks looking for ways to
cheat the law.

We were spoiled rich kids
hiding behind our parents’ coat-
tails and their wallets.

We were awful.

The Board of Supervisors is
looking at some proposed revi-
sions to the county noise ordi-
nance, and students don’t even
know it’s happening.

The ordinance will end
weekday parties in the country,
and it would eventually phase
out all parties at the standard
places——the Pole Houses and
Windfall Hill.

It would require a permit
system that would allow the
university to take formal action
against individual students for
throwing parties that get out of
control. _

The community is all for it.

And one could easily un-
derstand why. At the meeting,

Iraq: not another Nam

Whatever your stance is on Iraq, stop calling it the next Vietnam

By Abel S. Delgado
CO LUM NIST

In just the ﬁrst year of major
battles, American forces suffered
5,800 casualties. The war seemed
to have no clear direction or pur-
pose. Our men were dying to prop
up a corrupt government that had
nothingyto do with what we call
democracy. No, I’m ‘ not talk-
ing about Iraq. I’m talking about
Vietnam, and those who think the
two wars mirror each other need
to pick up a better history book.

Some opponents of the second
Gulf War have long relied on the
Vietnam War as a crutch to con-
vince others we’re wrong about
Iraq. But whether you agree with
the current war or not, you should
be able to set them apart.

Just look at the numbers. It
took three years for us to even
suﬁ°er half of the casualties in
Iraq that we suffered in Vietnam
in 1966. No reasonable person
thinks 58,000 Americans—the
number who died in Vietnam—
will lose their lives in the current
conﬂict.

Look at the reasons we went
to war in both places. Say what
you want about the missing
WMDs, but the mission is called

Operation Iraqi Freedom. Last
I checked, there is no longer a
homicidal dictator who hires rap-
ists to torture the young daughters
of political prisoners.

Last time I checked, the Iraqis
are voting in one election after an-

I other. Unlike our elections, where

people face no threat of dying
at the polls and still don’t vote,
people are voting in Iraq, lots of
people, and they’re not going to
let some car bomb stop them from
dyeing their ﬁngers purple.

In Vietnam, we went in to
contain communism, not spread
democracy. We had no intention
of liberating the Vietnamese. If
we did we would have fought
both the communist north and the
comipt south. We assumed that
the enemy of our enemy was our
ﬁiends and soon ended up with-
out any friends.

Look at the progress we’ve
made in Iraq compared to our
country. In less than three and
half years they have had open
elections and have written a con-
stitution. It took us ﬁve years to
have any form of government
between the states (which failed)
after we declared independence in
1776, and our constitution didn’t
come until 11 years after that fate-

ful day in July. And yet we say
there is no progress in Iraq.

Did you know there are cur-
rently more women with seats in
the Iraqi Parliament than there
are in our Congress? And we say
they don’t value women’s rights.
You’d be hard-pressed to ﬁnd any
“success stories” like these from
the Vietnam War.

And yet we continue. We keep
on making false comparisons be-
tween a war fought with meaning
and a war that never had a good
meaning. We ignore the prog-
ress and pay attention to the car
bombs. Why? Because it’s easy.
It’s easy to throw in the Vietnam
card, call it a quagmire, and give
up once things get rough.

Thomas Paine once wrote
about “sunshine patriots” who

supported independence just as
long as they didn’t have to suf-
fer for it. And if the argument is
that we shouldn’t make sacriﬁces
for other people’s freedom, then
the French and Spanish shouldn’t
have helped us during the Revo-
lution and we shouldn’t have
liberated Europe from the Nazis,
right?

In no way am I saying the ca-
sualties suffered in Iraq are okay.
One dead is one too many. But if
the opponents of the war really
cared about the soldiers like they
claim to, they would give their
lives, and their mission, its due
signiﬁcance.

In many cases,'the soldiers in
Vietnam had their lives shattered.
In many cases, the soldiers in Iraq
are saving shattered lives.

neighbors talked about how they
couldn’t sleep at night. They
talked about their small children.
They talked about the trash that
ends up in their yards.

The university supports it, too.
They need formal complaints in
order to punish students for off-
campus parties.

It’s just another way they can
control student life.

This noise ordinance guaran-
tees more complaints and stricter
punishments.

The only person who stood up
for the students was the sheriff.

He asked the board to wait
before passing the changes to the
ordinance. He said he thinks the
students can make a difference
without changing the law.

The sheriff is willing to give
us a chance——so why aren’t the
residents?

Because relationships with the
community have gotten that bad.

Or is it because the sheriff
doesn’t live next ‘to Windfall
Hill? ‘

Students did not show up to
argue for themselves. Half the
students we talked to didn’t even
know about it.

In the meantime, the board is
slowly honing a law which will
exclusively attack student party-
ing oﬁ“-campus.

And no one is doing anything
about it.

What is important here is to
make sure that everyone’s rights
are protected——on both sides.

Those neighbors have been

here a long time, too. They pay
high taxes to live in those homes,
which they bought for the peace
of the surrounding mountains.

They are senior citizens and
families with small children and
people who have to wake up early
for a hard day at work.

At the same time, it’s ridicu-
lous to call the sheriﬂ°’s office at
11:30 on a Saturday night.

They have better things to
worry about, like meth labs and
drunk drivers.

College students have a right
to recreation just like everyone
else. When you’re 21 in a town
with no clubs and only one bar,
what exactly are your options?

That doesn’t mean we’re tell-
ing the student body to stop be-
ing neighborly and party like it’s
1999.

We’re just saying that we all
need to work at this together.

How many W&L students
living off-campus actually know
who their neighbors are? Would
you recognize them at Wal—Mart?
Do you know where they work or
who their kids are?

Maybe if we would reach out
to the neighbors, they would be
more understanding of us.

Maybe they wouldn’t mind so
much that we’re students having
a party on a weekend, and maybe
we would have more compassion
for a pregnant woman trying to
get some rest. "

If both groups can understand
each other, then we won’t need
such draconian laws.

Fraternities turn focus away from beer and onto community service

Philanthropy Chairs for the various fraterni-

ties work to involve the men in events that give

back to the community. Without participation

requirements, some frats solve the problem

with yearly events like Derby Days.

By Sarah Klentz
smrr wrmsn

When Washington & Lee stu-
dents think of fraternities, most
think of boys using their creative
genius to generate the best party,
the preppiest outﬁt, and the most
imaginative way to get drunk. Yet
in most of our fraternities’ mis-
sion statements, the words “com-
munity service” are prominent.

Senior Tye Haeberle was the
Campus Outreach Chair for the
Nabors Service League during his
sophomore year.

He said his job was to get the
fraternities more involved and
encourage them to do fraternity-
wide service events.

“We had the hardest time get-
ting frats out to do stuff,” Hae-
berle said. “We would try to get
people to do things, and it was
like pulling teeth.”

Some fraternities do incorpo-

“.?e2s:11s; {.“h:t°istiat'E1e:< same §ﬁ:;':':?’{:.$‘

rate service into their agendas. Ju-
nior Robert Walker, Philanthropy
Chair for Lambda Chi Alpha, said
his fratemity has several orga-
nized events they participate in
throughout the year.

These include volunteering
at a haunted house in October, a
food drive around Thanksgiving,
and sponsoring gifts for a Head
Start class during Christmas.

In addition to other assorted
projects throughout the year, a
few of Lambda’s members adopt-
ed a youth football team that they
are currently coaching.

Walker said that although
Lambda sponsors these events,
they. do not set a requirement as
far as the number of events their
members attend.

“The fraternity doesn’t require
anything, but I personally encour-
age as many people to come as
they can,” Walker said.

He added that most members

attend at least one or two events
each year.

Walker said most fraternities
have “signature events” to either
raise money or give back to the
community, whether it is some-
thing more social like Sigma Chi’s
Derby Days or a blood drive.

Sophomore Jack Fisher, Chi
Psi Philanthropy Chair, said that
Chi Psi’s most popular service
event is the blood drive which
they put on twice a year.

“You’re not just giving money
for some obscure thing,” Fisher
said. “You’re giving literally part
of yourself, your blood, to help
somebody. It’s a pretty important
thing.”

Haeberle said that FIJI en-
courages members to participate
in service, but the fraternity does
not have any set events

“And I hate to say that,” Hae-
berle said.

One of the largest problems in
trying to get fraternity boys in-
volved, Haeberle said, is that very
few people associate the fratemi-
ties with service.

“How many guys decide
where to [rush] based on how
many hours they’ve put in?” Hae-
berle said. “Guys don’t join frats
for the service thing.”

Haeberle added that it does
not mean that fraternity members
have no desire, but that “there’s a

Back



big divide between social events
and service events.”

Fisher said he hopes more
fraternity members will become
more involved so they can change
the image that the fraternities cur-
rently hold.

“Aubrey [Shinoﬁeld, faculty
adviser for Nabors] and [Jason]
Rodocker [director of Campus
Activities and Greek Life] are get-
ting together and trying to make it
easier for fraternity members to
get involved so the image of frats
is less parties and beer cans and

more getting involved in the com- _

munity,” Fisher said.

Walker agreed that the frater-
nities can work together to change
their image.

“Since there are so many of
us here, there’s a large opportu-
nity for us all to get involved,”
Walker said. “The frat system
has a stereotype we can work to
eliminate.”

Senior McNeel Keenan,
a current Campus Outreach
Chair, said that Nabors is trying
to set up projects for groups in
order to encourage fraternities
to get involved together. I

“What we’re trying to do is
set up projects that are orient-
ed to groups so that they can
sponsor something or work on
something together,” Keenan
said. “It’s good because we
can help the fraternity out by
bringing them together while
helping out the community.”

Keenan added that a lot of
fraternity brothers do commu-
nity service on their own.

Nabors is trying to make it
easier for groups to come out
together by coming up with
group projects so that all fra-
ternities have to do is contact
Nabors instead of having to
come up with service activities
on their own, Keenan said.

“Since there are so many of us here, there is

a large opportunity for us all to get involved.

T he frat system has a stereotype we can work

W&L celebrates
Hispanic Heritage
Month

By Whltney Burns
s TA rr w RITE n

Aside from the ever—present
tacos in the Marketplace and gen-
eral education Spanish classes,
many of Washington and Lee’s
students are not exposed to a
culture that differs from their all-
American values.

Within the next month, how-
ever, the opportunity for such ex-
posure will present itself.

The Multicultural Student As-
sociation, with three co-sponsors,
including the Elrod Commons,
are honoring Hispanic Heritage
Month.

This celebration of Hispanic’

and Latino culture kicked off on
September 15, and the festivities
have been occuring ever since.

One of the ﬁrst activities was
a showing of “The Lost City”, a
ﬁlm documenting the Cuban rev-
olution in which power transfered
from Batista to Castro.

There was also a potluck din-
ner at the International House.
This dinner was an opportunity
for members of MSA and Stu-
dent Association for International
Learning (SAIL) to prepare and
share different Hispanic dishes
with one another.

These activities, however, are
not limited to MSA and SAIL
members.

All members of the commu-
nity, including residents of Rock-
bridge County, are invited and
encouraged to participate.

MSA President Quiana McK-
enzie elaborated, saying, “While
[the celebrations] are largely for
the W&L community, we really
want to open it up to everyone,”
she said.

“We understand that the Lex-
ington and Rockbridge areas
could beneﬁt from it as well.”

In the coming weeks, the His-
panic American Youth of Day-
tona, ‘Florida will be performing
traditional and contemporary cul-
tural dances in Lenfest.

W&L students will also be
given the opportunity to show off
their own dancing talent, or lack
thereof, when salsa dancers show
up to give lessons in the Market-
place on October 6.

“They will be playing for four
hours, so you can come in and
dance your heart out,” said McK-
enzie

Aﬂer the break for reading
days, there will be several more
weeks of activities, including a
showing of the Oscar-winning
movie “Frida”, the artist and
wife of Diego Rivera. The 2002
movie is known for its star Salma
Hayek.

Zenaida Mendez also is giving
a lecture, sponsored by KEWL,
at the end of October. Mendez in
the founder of the National Do-
minican Women’s Caucus and is
expected to speak on femicide in
Latin America.

“This is a topic that many peo-
ple don’t talk about,” said McK-
enzie. “She will show a ﬁlm and

then give a very powerful lecture.
It should be exciting.”
More information on the

events of Hispanic Heritage
month can be found online on the
Calendar of Events [httpz//events.
wlu.edu].

There are also reminders for
upcoming events in campus no-
tices.

So now that the door to a more
culturally exposed life has been
opened, what will you do?

McKenzie recommends,
“Bridge the gap between academ-
ics and true cultural experience.”

Cup are the premier intema-
tional competitions for men’s and
women’s professional tennis, re-
spectively.

Well, just to throw stats out at
you, the U.S. has only reached the
ﬁnals in the Davis Cup once since
1997, and has only reached the
ﬁnals of the Fed Cup once since
2000.

Keeping this in mind, it strikes
me as being quite odd that the top
two career money leaders for men
in this sport are American (also
four of the top ten), and two of
the top three women are Ameri-
can (also ﬁve of the top eight).

Moving on. This year was the
ﬁrst year of the World Baseball
Classic. And if you happened to
miss it, you can probably put two
and two together and ﬁgure out
where I’m going by mentioning
it. The U.S., who claims baseball
to be the “American Pastime,”
barely made it out of its ﬁrst
round pool, and went on to lose to
Mexico in the next round. Mex-
ico? Quick, name three Mexican
players. That’s what I thought.
My personal opinion: Get a new
pastime, America.

I could continue, describing
how if it weren’t for a certain mir-
acle and a few sporadic solid ﬁn-
ishes at the Olympics, hockey is
not something Americans should
brag about. Or I could say that
since the existence of the World
Cup, the U.S. Men’s soccer team
has only ﬁnished in the top four

once, (in 1930). Or I could say
that the U.S. has lost three straight
Weber Cups to the Europeans (the
Weber Cup is like the Ryder Cup
of bowling). But I think those
three sports speak for themselves
(although women’s soccer is still
a top program, so props to them).
Anyway, what can we make of
this?

Hmm. To me, (and of course
I am no expert), it seems that
Americans have a tendency to
underachieve in international
competitions. However, we do
quite well elsewhere, where there
may be a good deal more money
involved.

Now it would be an extremely
bold statement if I were to accuse
Americans of caring more about
personal fame and fortune and
less about pride for their country,
which is why I will just imply it.
It just seems that the higher con-
tracts get in American sports, the
worse we do against other coun-
tries. But again, I am no expert.

So to all of you millionaire
American professional athletes
out there who happen to stop by
Washington and Lee speciﬁcally
to read a sports column in The
Ring-tum Phi by a freshman writ-
er, I want you to know that the
secret is out. (We know you care
more about pocketing your $10
million for shooting a basketball
and an ad campaign then you do
about our country’s athletic status
on the world stage). There you
go. I may have whispered it, but
I said it.

Monday Night Sports Beat co-hosts express dismay surrounding sore lack of
attendance at W&L sporting events, ignorance of legends that deﬁned sports

Andy (a.k.a. the Blue Hen):
Hi, Hello and welcome to the
newest segment included in the

' Ring-tum Phi’s sport section,

entitled “Outloud.” If you like
what we have to say, or really
don’t care for it, all I can say is
thank you for taking the time to
read this. And if you want more
of this kind of stuff, listen in to
the Monday Night Sports Beat on
91.5 FM or http://wlur.wlu.edu
on Mondays from 7 — 9p.m.

Neil (a.k.a
the Wolver-
ine): Andy,
this isn’t
radio. You
don’t have to
say Hi, hello

 

and welcome.

The Blue Hen: Oh, ok. Well,
this section of the paper is go-
ing to examine broad themes in
sports and our opinions of these
topics. So to get this kicked oﬂ‘,
I think the biggest positive aspect
in sports is that it can unite people
everywhere. Whether it’s attend-
ing a Washington and Lee football
game or ral-
lying around
a local team
in a difﬁcult
time, sports
is a uniter,
not a divider.
We witnessed
this after 9/ 11 in New York, with
the New York Yankees and a
country, and once again last Mon-
day Night when the city of New
Orleans rallied around the Saints
and inspired them to a 23-3 vic-
tory over the Atlanta Falcons. A

 

lot of articles have outlined the
recent divide between students
and faculty. However, I believe
this can be avoided through the
world of athletics. Here at Wash-
ington and Lee, we have begun
to witness a transformation in
how our fans bring our commu-
nity together. This week, we saw
a packed Warner Center help the
W&L volleyball team achieve a
5 game victory over ODAC rival
Randolph Macon. We also wit-
nessed numerous fans stay to the
very end as Washington and Lee
picked up their ﬁrst ODAC win of
the season over Randolph-Macon,
with freshmen Quarterback R.J.
Vamer leading the way in the sec-
ond half. (On a side note, our best
wishes go out to Hunter Dawkins
for a speedy recovery after break-
ing his collarbone on Saturday.)
However, it is my opinion that
our community, and by commu-
nity I mean our entire community,
is not entirely united. Saturday
at Wilson Field, I watched fewer
students attend the game then I
had witnessed the entire season.
Of those that did attend, many of
them leﬁ at halftime. In addition,
I only saw a handful of profes-
sors and staff in attendance. I ap-
plaud those students and faculty
members for attending sporting
events but want to challenge ev-
eryone to take a more active role
in all aspects of the university.
Washington and Lee is not a ﬁve
day-a- week experience or job.
In fact, it’s a seven day-a-week
experience, with students work-
ing academically, athletically, so-
cially and in clubs or committees
every minute of every day. I’d
like to challenge the student body

and the faculty to take an active
role in uniting this community
through greater involvement in
each other’s lives both in and out
of the classroom. And I person-
ally believe the ﬁrst step in this is
supporting Washington and Lee’s
outstanding athletic teams.

The Wolverine: It’s obvious
that I’ve lowered my standards
since you now ﬁnd me in the Phi,
but I’ll try and make the best of
this situation.

While I am in no way an old
sports fan, I sometimes feel like
it. I know the history of the ma-
jor sports. I know about and rec-
ognize the contributions of men
and women such as Billie Jean
King, Jim Thorpe, Satchal Paige
and Harry Vardon. It saddens
me when sports fans these days
don’t know about these people
or understand their contributions
to their respective sports. I call
on everyone reading this (all 17
of you) to take the time every so
often to learn about the history
of your favorite sport or team.
Learn stories, legends and lore.
Not only does it make you a better
fan, but it also helps these great
people and teams live on for fu-
ture generations.

One great man that is often
overlooked in conversations about
all time sports greats passed away
recently. Byron Nelson, known to
many as Lord Byron for his gen-
tlemanly demeanor and spirit, was
recognized by many as having
one of the most graceful swings
ever, but is probably best known
for having what many consider
the greatest season in golﬁng
history. In 1945, Nelson won 18

tournaments, including an incred-
ible 11 in a row. Many, including
the great Tiger Woods, say that
Nelson’s record is safe forever
(though Tiger’s win streak will
continue after he ﬁnishes tomor-
row’s round). Nelson retired from
golf in 1946, at the age of 34, to
become a rancher. With no mil-
lion dollar paychecks or mega-en-
dorsement deals, Nelson said that
he used to look at each paycheck
as a way to buy some more cattle
or farm equipment. Nelson’s 113
straight cuts in his career are sec-
ond only to Tiger Woods’ 146, but
each those 113 cuts represents a
top-20 ﬁnish, something that is
unparalleled. Woods has only
managed 2] straight top-20 ﬁn-
ishes during his years on tour. In
1968, the PGA Tour renamed the
Dallas Open in his honor. He was
the only golfer to have a tourna-
ment named after them until Ar-
nold Palmer recently had a tour-
nament named after him. Nelson
is one of the greatest golfers ever
and was the last of a generation.

Sports fans out there, take
time to honor the great ones.
Read books like “Paper Lion,” by
George Plimpton, or “Ball Four,”
by former major leaguer Jim
Bouton. Sports now are not as
they once were. In today’s wired
world high school athletes can
suddenly become worldwide ce-
lebrities, while men like Francis
Ouimet have been forgotten long
ago. With Byron Nelson having
recently passed away, and Buck
O’Neill in failing health, sports
fans are losing opportunities to
learn about some of the greatest
athletes ever. Without the past,
there is no future.

  Stifled rivalry

Two remotely different cultures that border each
other release tension, agression through athletics

By Mike Huntress
COLUMNIST

Washington and Lee and Vir-
ginia Military Institute coexist
on what are normally perfectly
civil terms. Until Saturday, my
experience with them consisted
solely of them jogging by as I
walk the campus, and my giv-
ing them an uneasy head nod of
acknowledgement, and receiving
an equally uneasy head nod of ac-
knowledgement in return.

Sports bring out that rivalry in
all its intensity, and everyone at
the rugby game on Saturday was
witness to it.

“They think we’re all riﬂe-tot-
ing morons,” VMI rugby player
Garreth Chuna said. “We think
they’re all pink shirt-wearing,
collar-popping queers.”

Rugby is a spectacle in the
same vain as a demolition derby.
In the same way the demoli-
tion derby takes the best parts
of NASCAR (which all but the
sport’s purest fans will admit is
the crashes) and excludes the
monotonous, circular racing part
of it, rugby takes the best parts
of football (the bone crunching
hits) and strings them all together
in one free-ﬂowing outburst of
violence without the whistles and
pauses that characterize football.

Both sides of the ﬁeld --there
is a distinct VMI side and a dis-
tinct W&L side-- can stake claim
to a minimal amount of rugby
knowledge, but the VMI side can
at least claim to be involved in the
game. The quality of the sports
spectatorship on both sides seems
to appropriately ﬁt each school’s
stereotype.

A handful of VMI fans literal-
ly sprinted from end to end along
with the team’s bench as the play
moves on the ﬁeld, wrapped up
in a rugby fervor that stems not
from being tied up with the intri-
cacies of the game, but rather the
palpable feeling of brutality and
sheer aggression that the players
exude. Meanwhile, the W&L side
of the ﬁeld looked like a subdued
frat party, with small social circles
forming around the keg, discuss-
ing things far removed from the

ggneggoing on behind them.

And yeisjthere were indeed a
lot of pink shirts and a handﬁil of
popped collars.

The VMI—W&L annual rugby
game is typically one-sided, and
indeed this year was predicted to
be a decisive victory for the Key-
dets.

Midway through the second
half, with the score at 15-5, fresh-
man player Zachary Bohm de-
scribed the game’s predictions to
me as such: If the game was be-
ing bet on in Las Vegas and you
took W&L, you probably won
some money. We’d have covered
the spread.

In other words, W&L was ex-
pected to lose big.

It’s not hard to fathom why
the game has so much more im-
portance for VMI. Losing to a
group of what I’m sure most ca-
dets would characterize as “pretty
boys” would seem to depreciate a
lot of what they work for.

Just by standing near the VMI
sideline and covertly listening
in on what was being shouted
amongst themselves, it was clear
toughness and intensity are high-
ly regarded virtues.

Standing near the W&L side-
line, a story is told in epic fashion
about an exhausted W&L rugby
player who in the middle of the
game ran over to the sideline,
chugged a beer, and ran back on
the ﬁeld.

Calling the rivalry solely
based on geographical proximity
wouldn’t really do it justice.

The chasm between mutual
understanding is underscored
every time I hear a W&L student

e..-

“In much the same way you cringe when you

witness a car accident, I cringed when I wit-

nessed men doing all they could to tear each

other apart limb by limb. ”

MIKE HUNTRESS columnist

 

say as they pass VMI’s campus,
“I don’t understand why anyone
would want to go there. That
place looks like a prison.”

Staring from sideline to side-
line reveals another differing sen-
sibility. Off on the W&L sideline
are (already well documented
and previously alluded to) pastel
button downs and Ralph Lauren
polos, pink ties and dress shoes,
sundresses and pearl necklaces,
and all other things preppy.

The VMI fans are dressed in
a comfortable, yet common way:
jeans and a sweatshirt with their
school’s name displayed promi-
nently in front--none of the splash
and pizzazz of the W&L sideline.

For all the talk about the way
the two campuses ﬂow seamless-
ly into one another, it’s more like
mixing water and grease. They
mingle, but in a way that only
seems to accentuate the rift that
exists.

A true rugby expert could
more adequately tell you how this
manifested itself on the ﬁeld Sat-
urday, but to an untrained eye like
myself I can only report that the
game wasn’t lacking in intensity.

In much the same way you
cringe when you witness a car ac-
cident, I cringed when I witnessed
men doing all they could to tear
each other apart limb by limb.

The tension was at its apex
when one of the sides took excep-
tion to a particularly hard hit by
the other side. The result was a
pushing and shoving match, full
of male posturing and those stares
that are supposed to assert alpha
status. Any further excitement
was allayedby a VMI cadet who
authoritatively told all the cadets
to calm down and move away
from the W&L players in a man-
ner beﬁtting of a future military
leader.

“Not every guy has a rivalry
with W&L. The guy standing

next to me says he has a rivalry
with you guys, but personally, I
enjoy your guy’s company,” ﬁrst-
classman Chris Guy said.

There was one moment at Sat-
urday’s game that would melt the
heart of even the most hardened
of fans: Rob Rain, one of W&L’s
more prominent students and
rugby players, walks off the ﬁeld
hand pressed tight up against the
side of his head, trying to stop the
trickle of blood.

He looks like a war movie
hero, strolling away from the
ﬁeld of battle, with dirt and mud
mixing with the blood to create a
wound every rugby player could
be proud of. He walks over to the
VMI sideline to ask if they have
bandages, and in an act of high
symbolism, three or four cadets
gather around him and wrap his
head in gauze. While this is going
on only feet from the game behind
them, they talk easily, almost like
war buddies.

After being wrapped, Rain
walked back to his side of the
ﬁeld, and instantly the cadets
became engrossed in the action
again, screaming: “Take him
down!” and “Give him a head
butt!” along with the other unut-
terable profanities bombarding
the ﬁeld from both sidelines. Yet
that one moment of shining civil-
ity, although ﬂeeting, seemed to
rise above all the others as the one
that deﬁnes the rivalry. The game
ended with a VMI win and there
were no overzealous celebration
by the victors and no visible ag-
ony in the losers.

They both got what they came
for. VMI is content to go home
with a win, having showed su-
perior toughness and physical
prowess, and W&L seem seems
equally content to go home hav-
ing proved their own toughness
and worth in the eyes of their
cross town rivals.

Rugby confronts VMI

Writer investigates rules of play, rigorous training schedule of Screaming Minks

By Joel Poelhuls
STA F F W RITE R

Rugby: the fast-paced pass-
ing, unfamiliar terms, and con-
stant movement of the game were
enough to bafﬁe and confuse me
on my ﬁrst and only day of prac-
tice. '

Hailing from Southern In-
diana, the only way I had even
heard of rugby was from certain
students’ Abercrombie shirts and
vague allusions in British-themed
material.

Still, the sport famed for its
tough physical play intrigued me,
and I decided to venture to a prac-
tice here at Washington and Lee.

Only then did it become clear
to me just how little I knew about
a sport with considerable com-
plexities. Rugby is a sport unlike
any other.

The W&L rugby team, the
Screaming Minks, plays by rugby
union rules. This means that each
team has 15 players on the ﬁeld at

a time-—seven backs

Score (the smaller, faster
W&L 10 players) and eight

bers of the pack
VMI 22 mm

(the larger players
who scrum). The
same players stay on the ﬁeld for
both offense and defense.

Players advance the ball by
running forward and throwing
backwards or laterally to other
teammates.

Offensive progress is stopped
by tackling, at which point either
a ruck or maul forms, depending
on whether or not the ball-carrier
has gone to the ground or not.

A player can also advance the
ball by kicking it forward, but the
player who catches it must be be-
hind the kicker when the ball is
kicked.

Scoring is not unlike Ameri-
can football. A team receives ﬁve
points for downing the ball in the
opposing end zone and two points
for kicking through the goal posts
afterwards. Three points through
the goalposts can be scored either
as a penalty kick or by drop-kick-
ing during play.

Sophomore treasurer Sean
McKinley described the game

Sophomore Josh Prell escapes a tackle from a Virgi

as “a combination between foot-
ball and soccer,” because there is
physical tackling, but gameplay
does not stop.

_ McKinley played football in
high school and added that the
lack of equipment is hard to get
used to when tackling.

Gameplay aside, one of the
more unique things about rugby
is the sportsmanship and more
laid-back atmosphere. There is
usually a keg at the Minks’ home
ﬁeld, Highland Belle, during half-
time.

“It’s a tradition that one team
will always invite the other to
their after-party,” McKinley said.
“Sportsmanship is very important
on and off the ﬁeld ”

Practice, however, is all busi-

ness. Most practices consist of
about 15 minutes of sprint exer-
cises, 45 minutcs of work split up
into the backs and the pack, and
one hour of full-on scrimmaging.

Every two weeks or so, the
team ﬁnds a more unique method
of conditioning. A keg is placed at
an off-campus house and the team
assembles and runs a roundabout
way, usually at least two miles, to
the keg.

Leading the Minks are coach
Tom Lovell, team captains Rob
Wilson and Dan Ward, and club
president Roberto “Tino” Tovo.

Since rugby is a club, rather
than varsity sport, Tovo is respon-
sible for administration, travel,
and organizing matches as well as
on-the-ﬁeld duties.

XC sees success

Men, women set ambitious goals for end of season

By Lara Jordan
STAFF warren

The goal of both the women’s
and men’s cross country team this
year is to win the ODAC Cham-
pionship, making it three in a row
for the women and two in a row
for the men.

“Winning three years in a row
for both teams from a school has
never happened in the history of
the ODAC, but then either did
two in a row,” said women’s
coach Kris Hoey.

The women’s team has ﬁn-
ished seventh out of 27 teams at
the Paul Short Invitational, ﬁrst
out of 10 teams at the Washington
and Lee invitational, ﬁfth out of
28 squads at the NYU Invitational
and sixth out of nine teams at the
Maroon Invitational, hosted by
Roanoke College.

The men’s team has placed
10th out of 26 at the Paul Short
Invitational, ﬁrst out of seven
teams at the W&L Invitational
and third out of 35 teams at the
NYU Invitational.

The women contribute their
successes to a strong team dy-
namic.

“Everyone is truly out for the
team and not for themselves,”
said Hoey.

“They know if they improve
they will in turn help others im-

prove too. Everyone on the team
wants to succeed.”

The men see their advantage as
that of the practice environment.

“The environment for training
in Lexington is very beneﬁcial
to us,” said junior Tom Brower.
“Our course is currently the high-
est rated course in terms of tough-
ness in the state of Virginia.”

Despite a large number of un-
derclassman, Hoey looks forward
to a strong season.

“Some other teams may look
at our roster and see quite a few
freshmen and take that as a dis-
advantage for us, but really all
of our freshmen are very mature
runners who come from strong
backgrounds,” said Hoey.

Health has been a disadvantage
to the men’s team this season.

“The team’s biggest issue right
now is staying healthy,” said ju-
nior Steve Rivoir. “We are a little

thinner than years past and cannot
afford to have any injuries to our
top runners.”

The men’s team has been
working hard to train new mem-
bers.

“Freshmen are expected to
play a signiﬁcant role on the team
here,” said Brower.

“We want them to learn how
to race an 8K and understand how
Coach Tucker’s training program
works from a physiological per-
spective.”

The teams’ are optimistic
about ﬁnishing the season.

“Our team has fresh new out-
look on what Cross Country at
Washington and Lee can be and is
becoming,” said Hoey.

Both teams return will com-
pete at the Virginia State Division
I1-III Meet at Peak View Farms
in Harrisonburg, Va on Saturday,
Oct. 7.

Tovo attributes much of the
team’s dominance this year to
their activities last spring.

“We went to Argentina last
spring break, and we played
against really tough teams. Argen-
tine teams are some of the better
ones in football. We even had a
coach from the Argentina national
team train us,” Tovo said.

Pushing the envelope against
tough teams has enabled the
Minks to post an unbeaten 3-0
record in the conference. Their
overall record is 3-2 after a hard
fought 22-10 loss to Division I
VMI on Saturday.

tencacity of the Minks’ defense.

Traditionally. VMI defeats
W&L by a much larger margin.

“It was amazing. They are
much bigger and stronger, and we
were tackling them like it didn’t
matter,” said Tovo.

The team aspires to win the
Ed Lee Invitational this year, hav-
ing already been invited due to
their record.

If the Minks prevail in the In-
vitational, they will move up to
Division II competition.

With all the ﬁne points and
rules, rugby, like any other sport,
comes down to conditioning,
toughness, and teamwork.

Said McKinley: “I still don’t
know all the rules.”

America falls short
in realm of sports

Freshman claims  athletes
are under-achieving globally

ball talent in the world, both the
men’s and women’s U.S. teams
received third place.

Additionally, in the 2004
Olympics, our supposed “Dream
Team” ﬁnished third as well,
which sounds like more of a
nightmare to me. Since when are
we the third best in anything, es-
pecially basketball?

How is it that ﬁfteen of the top
sixteen scorers in the NBA are
American, yet we lose to teams
like Argentina?

This year at the Ryder Cup, the
Europeans defeated the United
States 18 ‘/2 to 9 ‘/2. And no, in
this case it is not good to have the
lower score.

A similar score has resulted
from the past three Ryder Cups
(six years), and from the looks
of things, it doesn’t appear that
Tiger, Phil, and the rest of the
American crew are looking to
change their status.

How is it that seven of the
top ten career money leaders are
American, (all of whom have par-
ticipated in the past three Cups),
and yet we fail to challenge the
inferior Europeans?

The Davis Cup and the Fed
Cup are the premier international

Inaugural activities centerpiece of homecoming weekend

By Sacha Raab
STAFF WRITER

omecoming

weekend is two

weeks away, and

already the stu-
dents, University Security,
and inhabitants of Lexington
are beginning to feel the ex-
citement and tension of this
major event.

This year the weekend is
even more important, as it is
combined with President Ken-
neth Ruscio’s inauguration.

Lexington is expecting
3.000 to 4,000 out-of-town
gJests.and 150 VIP guests,
including many representa-
tives from other colleges and

universities.

This inﬂux of visitors is
causing concerns for the Uni-
versity Security, who will be
employing all of their staff on
that Saturday.

The University already
struggles with parking ar-
rangements, and the popular-
ity of the weekend will surely
cause complications.

University Security is
planning on using the parking
areas that are typically used
for major events; however,
they will most likelynot be
sufficient.

Students typically seem to
be excited mostly for Home-
coming parties and events.
According to sophomore Kel-

si Robinson, it is the ﬁrst big
date weekend at Washington
and Lee, though it really only
involves a few cocktail par-
ties and maybe a date.

“It always, causes some
nerves, especially among the
girls who have no control
over the situation, consider-
ing the frats are the ones with
all of the events and parties,”
Robinson said.

Junior Kelly Will agrees
that the students are generally
looking forward to the parties
and all of the visitors coming
into Lexington from out of
town, especially alumni who
have recently graduated.

“I don’t really know what
kind of stir the President’s

Inauguration is making, but
people seem to like Ruscio a
lot, so I’m sure people are in-
terested to see the beginning
of his era,” Will said.
According to Will, Home-
coming is an important week-
end for the school because of
all the returning alumni and
fraternity rush events.

Homecoming weekend
should be a great success this
year.

Combined with Ruscio’s
inauguration, the city of Lex-
ington and the University will
beneﬁt from its weekend in
the spotlight with alumni, col-
legiate representatives, and
plenty of other supporters of
the school.

that are meaningful to them.
Also seeing the diversity of

Workers lay down
sod and sidewalks
during construction

By Dane Davis
STAFF WRITER

In a temporary yet expensive
project, thousands of dollars in
grass outside the Elrod Com-
mons has been torn up and re-
placed with sod.

It may surprise some, but
this isn’t the first time the uni-
versity has landscaped the Elrod
Commons’ courtyard. Randolph
Hare, Project Manager of the
construction and landscaping
around Elrod Commons, said,
“The area between the Co—op
and Commons was reseeded
after utility connections for the
Co—op were completed.”

Then why is money being
spent to re-sod the area?

Hare said, “The results were
less than satisfactory in part be-
cause of the poor quality of the
soil. In fact, the area from Reid
Hall to Graham-Lees Dorm
was in need of improvement.
The corners of the green spac-
es were wom from pedestrian
trafﬁc, there were drainage and
landscaping issues dating back
to the construction of Commons
that needed to be addressed."

Hare said the university
consulted with a landscaping
ﬁrm before deciding to re-sod
the entire area to make asthetic
improvements. He said the re-
sodding is an interim step in a
comprehensive _ improvement
of the area from Reid Hall to
Washington Street. Hare said
the project’s biggest changes
will happen during the summer
of 2007.

Phi: What are you looking for-
ward to about the inauguration?

Ruscio: It’s going to be a celebra-
tion of W&L. It’s not about me.
It’s about where we are and where
we’re headed.

It’s exciting to me that all differ-
ent members of the community
are involved.

It’s a chance to think hard about
W&L.

Phi: Can we have a preview of
your speech?

Ruscio: The general theme is that
it’ll be about not just liberal arts
education, but a Washington and
Lee liberal arts education. I’ll
talk about some of the disctinc-
tive qualities of W&L that make
us W&L.

square is provisional until 2007.
According to Facilities Man-
agement, the “ﬁnal courtyard
project will not begin until after
graduation, June 2007 and will
be completed by August 2007.”
This means that the sod and
concrete sidewalks will eventu-
ally be replaced.

Phi: Do you think students will
be interested and present at the
speech?

Ruscio: What I’ve told many stu-
dents is just come and have fun.
Come casually, sit on the lawn,
and watch what goes on. We
want it to not be a serious, overly
formal event, and of course there
will be lunch on the lawn after-
ward. We hope students will par-
ticipate.

Phi: If you could change one thing
right away, what would it be?

Ruscio: One thing I consider es-
pecially important, this year is to
consider the teacher—scholar mod-
el. This is more intangible than
some of the other goals.

I want to engage faculty in a dis-
cussion about what it is to be on

groundwork for some other things
we consider.

Phi: What are your goals for the
rest of the year?

Ruscio: A variety of things. We
have to be very determined to de-
velop ﬁnancial aid resources for
students. To continue to attract
the best and brightest students,
we must make sure cost isn’t a
deterrent.

We also have to recruit and main-
tain the best faculty and staff.
There are also important physical
projects, starting with the Colon-
nande. We’ll be making decisions
about speciﬁcs and design.
Students and faculty should look

“As long as they make the side-

then I’m okay with it.”

Homeless for a weekend

Nine students will .%‘])eI7(.f par’! of reading days living among the homeless on the streets of Washington, D. C.

By Sarah Kientz
STAFF WRITER

Most Washington and Lee
students look forward to reading
days as a break from what can be
a long and stressful start of the
school year. Many go home; oth-
ers relax and catch up on lronie
work and sleep. Most. l]O\VC\.'tIl.
do not spend their time living in
poverty.

According to sophomore Mi»
caela Coffey, nine W&L students
plan on taking the Urban Plunge,
a program through the National
Coalition for the Homeless. Vol-
unteers spend 48 hours living like
the homeless on the streets of
large cities. W&L students will be
taking the Plunge in Washington.
D.C., over the long weekend.

“You’re living on the streets in
D.C. as a homeless person with-
out the conveniences that we en-
joy here,” Coffey said. “No cell
phone, no credit card. no money
at all.”

Coffey, the Alternative Breaks
chair for Nabors Service League,
said that W&L students will be
split into three groups. During the
day, the groups will be on their
own and experience what it is like
to be homeless.

“They encourage you to pan-
handle for a couple of hours."
Coffey said. “Well, you have to.
or else you’re not going to lrzive
anything to eat.”

Soplioinore /\lden Wicker,
who will be participating in the
Plunge. said that although it might
be eiiibarrassing. she"'s looking
for'\vard to learning front experi-
ences like panhandling.

“*1 know it will be the most
huniiliirting thing I will have ever
clone to actually beg for money,“
Wicl<ci' .‘~'1.lltl. “lloprsfully being
hungry and seeing how people
who are like myself treat me
i‘«,'liL‘,ll l look ratty will teach me
something about myself.”

liiiiior Woodrow Friend is also
participating in the Urban Plunge.
Friend said the manual that the
National (‘oalitiori for the Home-
less gives to participants encour-
ages them to face the hardships
of looking for a job without the
conveniences of a car or a phone
niuriber.

“When reading the Urban
Plunge handbook. l found a note
encouraging others to apply for
fast food jobs. Mention that you
don‘t have a home or a phone
number but that you are willing to
check back every day. Those lines
caught my attention." Friend said.
“I am looking forward to trying to
find ajob as a plunger.”

The National Coalition for the
Homeless also encourages partici-
pants to “eiigagc with other home-
less people“ by playing cards or

just talking so that students can

"try to delve in as deep as [they]
can iiitr.‘ that whole world." Cof-

fey said.

“We’ll be able to experience
what it’s really like to not have
anything to do," Coffey said.
“Like the homeless. wc‘ll be
walking all day and not ending up
anywhere."

Senior Chris Tittle. iiivolvcd
in the Shepherd Poverty Program.
said he is looking forwarrl to r;oll--
necting with the people he meets
on the streets.

“I am much more excited than
scared about this because l have
worked with homeless people in
D.C., and for the most part. they
are normal people facing a variety
of adverse circumstances.” Tittle
said. “There certainly is an ele-
ment of danger and risk involved.
but that is what makes this sncli a
real experience.”

ln the evenings. the students
will spend the nights as a group
of nine with a guide. The group’s
guide will be John llarrison. a
homeless man who has been
working with the National Coali-
tion for the Homeless for several
years leading groups on the Ur-
ban Plunge. The group will either
sleep on the street or in a shelter.
Coffey said.

“The National (‘oalition
doesn’t really want college stu-
dents to take up beds in shelters.
but the group and the guide will
make the decision together de-
pending on the eirciimstariecs."
Coffey said.

Coffey added that the National
Coalition for the Homeless “al-
most requires peoplc to take shifts
so someone is awake at all times"
ifthe group sleeps on the street.

Although the experience seems
like it might be dangerous, Coffey
said the National Coalition for the
Homeless has been running the
program for over 20 years and
have never had any participant be
in danger.

Aubrey Shinofield. W&L”s
Service Learning Coordinator,
said she is conﬁdent in the group’s
safety during their Urban Plunge.

"I The National Coalition has]
done this program for such a long
time. and groups come back on
an annual basis.” Shinofreld said.
“I feel comfortable working with
them and they’ve assured a safe
CXp€l‘lt‘.ltCC for our students."

Sliinofield said that the number
of students who signed up for the
Urban Plunge exceeded her ex-
pectations. but she is excited for
them to step out of their molds.

“lt’s obviously going to be a
very intense experience.” Shine-
ﬁclcl said. “This isn”t going to be
a break at all—— it may not even
be fun. They’rc going to experi-
ence things that are going to make
them think. they’re not going to
get a lot ofsleep. but I’m proud of
the people that are going. Tlieyie
choosing to experience some-
thing they could never learn in the
clas.<ii.ioiri bttt that is absolutely

taking the plunge:

Students will:

- spend 48 hours living on the streets of D.C.
- sleep on the streets Oi‘ in a homeless shelter.

- panhandle and apply for jobs.

- be led by a homeless guide.

part of our education."

Coffey said she’s looking for-
ward to the experience. and that
she thinks the other eight students
will take a lot away from it.

“Its meant to be an emotional
challenge,” Coffey said. "but l
hope we gain a better understand-
ing of this issue that’s a big prob-
lem in our nation. especially our
nations capital. which is so close
to us."

Friend also said he thinks it is
important for W&L students to
learn how the less fortunate live.

“I believe that experiences like
these are very important for W&L
students.” Friend said. “For many
students. including myself. we
have been fortunate. being born
into wealthy and loving families.
Many others have not been so for-
tunate. lt will be a good experi-
ence to get out of my element and
interact with those people."

Although Wicker said that
“some people think [sires] crazy“
for going on the Urban Plunge.
she’s looking forward to finding
out l]0\\' litiiiielcss people live.

\

“I don‘t think it’s important for
everyone [to experience the Ur-
ban Plunge]. but it would help for
students who have never experi-
enced want and will be launched
directly into a afﬂuent life to live
on the other side of the tracks for
a bit." Wicker said. “I’m already
learning things. I always assumed
that homeless people were addict-
ed to drugs, or mentally retarded
or something. but I’m finding out
that isn’t always true. Hopefully
l‘ll come back with some valu-
able knowledge.”

In addition to realizing the
hardships of others, Tittle said he
feels he‘ll be able to gain personal
growth through the experience.

‘"1 think it is essential for per-
sonal growth to put yourself in
foreign and often uncomfortable
situations to find out who you re-
ally are and what you are capable
of." Tittle said. “It will hopefully
give me some insight not only
into the plight of the homeless,
but also into my own perspective
on life and what I want to accom-
plish.“

Lexington Police Chief Steve
Crowder says student parties are
staying quiet this fall.

Crowder’s department lras
only received a few noise t,Z0lll--
plaints about parties inside city
limits.

He said the department is-
sued only 11 court summons last
year for noise complaints but said
some of those may not have been
student parties.

During the first month of
school Lexington police otl'ieer:~;
issued a few written warnings but
did not write tickets for any stu-
dents.

Residents of Rockbridge
Country have been lobbying the
county Board of Supervisors to
crack down on large parties held
outside of city limits. County
residents have been especially
upset with the raucous parties
held at Windfall Hill and the Pole
Houses.

Crowder said his department
worked to find a happy medium
between the students’ parties and
what their neighbors are willin,i_.2

Mike Young. Director of(‘am-

avoided some of the couritr'y‘.«:
problems by building a good sys

Young said the current city
ordinance has been in place for
nearly 20 years. allowing students
to familiari7.e themselves with the
city‘s standards and regulations.

Because student houses inside
city limits are usually modest res-
idences with small yards. it is rare
for city parties to draw the large
crowds that flock to Windfall Hill
or the Pole Houses.

Mimi Elrod, the Director of
W&L’s Summer Scholars pro-

hears from angry neighbors.

“I think people who move in
close to the university anticipate
some noise," lilrod said.

tors of most fraternities make air

bors and solve concerns without

“Problems don’t go on and on
because the police are out and
about,” lilrod said. “Its not that
the police don‘t have anything
better to do. but it just doesn’t
take long to get places in town.”

While residents in the county
continue to battle with W&L stu-
dents over large parties, relation-
ships between students and their
neighbors remain placid inside
city limits.

l€lrod thinks that students who
live in town do a better job of get-
ring to know their neighbors.

“You‘re more patient when
you know people.” Elrod said.

The steady pressure to party

Believe it or not, you can have a fun and exciting night life without getting roaring drunk every single night

By Grace Andrews
c o L u M N I sr

Today’s topic is the party scene
at Washington and Lee, or at least
the pressure to party. Once again,
I must place a disclaimer here: If
any of what I say describes and/or

» offends you,
that isn’t my
goal. My
goal is sim-
ply to share
a few of my
opinions.

The oth-
er day, I was
talking to a
friend who
doesn’t go
out much.

The ﬁrst time she attended
a W&L party, she saw people
she knew hanging upside down,
drinking from garbage cans and
getting wasted.

These students were people
that she had thought were “mod-
erate drinkers,” or something of
the sort.

My friend, who shall remain
nameless, remembers random
people chanting her name and try-
ing to get her to take shots.

She was smart, strong, and

[insert adjective here] enough
to walk away, but some of her
friends were not.

They drank because they
wanted to be cool. After witness-
ing these “activities,” my friend
rarely goes out. Her story inspired
me to write this article. I thought
to myself, “how many people
here have been changed because
of the socialpressures to party
and to drink?”

Let’s start with a few of my
own personal stories. A few weeks
ago, I went to a party and saw
some friends who were “drunk.”
I use that term loosely because
one of them was pretending to be
drunk so that his friends wouldn’t
give him a hard time about not
drinking.

I had another friend tell me
recently that while at a party, one
of her drunken friends tried to co-
erce them repeatedly and almost
belligerently into drinking.

They even went so far as to use
the “good friend” excuse. I know
you’ve heard it before, because it
starts with, “You would if
you were a ‘good friend.”’

Now, what is the common
thread in these stories? Ding, ding,
ding, that’s right, all these people
were asked to drink. If you really

Last time I checked, a good time didn’t involve

a visit to the health center; making out with a

total stranger and then not recognizing them

the next day on the Colonnade, or losing every-

thing valuable at a Pole House.

need the non-drinkers to drink,
have water as a beverage option
for beer pong, or take alcohol free
Kool-Aid shots. However, if this
were to happen, the cases of H20
poisoning or sugar shock would
skyrocket.

Let me give a few stats to sup-
port my thoughts. In September
alone, there were 30 alcohol ar-
rests in Lexington.

This was only through Sept.
20; this was seven more than the
23 average of all alcohol related
arrest per month for the past four
years (‘O2-‘06).

When all the drinking inci-
dents were averaged out from
since 2002, we surpassed the me-
dian score repeatedly. Granted,
these averages aren’t just us, but
all of Lexington.

Although I wonder exactly
how much partying the retired
population of LexVegas is partici-
pating in.

I’m not going to lie; I some-
times don’t go out because I just
don’t want to deal with offensive-
ly drunk students.

I have no desire to carry a
babbling conversation or pretend
to listen to a drunken account of
some “hilarious” event that is not
funny because my BAC is lower
than 0.1.

I’m even guilty of going to a
party in my study clothes (I like to
call it my “hobo chic”) staying for
ten minutes and leaving. '

The only reason I do this is
because some of my friends will
laugh at me and even worry be-
cause they don’t think I’m going

out enough.

It’s not that I don’t want to
have fun, but since I don’t drink,
there seems to be nothing for me
to do at a party.

Now, I would go if great mu-
sic and even better dancing was
guaranteed, but since I ﬁnd some
of the music hard to dance to and
refuse to watch or accept drunken
teetering and tottering as dancing,
I just don’t go. I know that I’m not
the only one who feels this way.

Sometimes the party scene
here thoroughly confuses and
scares me. I have a hard time un-
derstanding why people get so
drunk that they can’t remember
anything they did the night be-
fore, or even their names.

Last time I checked, a good
time didn’t involve a visit to the
health center, losing everything
valuable at a Pole House, making
out with a total stranger and then
not recognizing them the next day
on the Colonnade.

It seems like to me that if peo-
ple drink for a “buzz,” or to feel
“loose,” a moderate amount of
alcohol could do the job.

The problem is when people
drink their own body weight in
ﬂuid ounces.

When I see people doing this,
I just have an urge in my heart to

give them watered-down apple
juice. '

Honestly, they are so drunk
they wouldn’t know or taste the
difference.

Iknow that right about now,
some people are reading and roll-
ing their eyes all around their head
at what I have to say and have no
intention of ever reading what I
write again (don’t worry, the co-
medic articles will be retuming
after reading days!).

Once again my goal isn’t to of-
fend anyone.

If you actively drink and even
get totally wasted, that’s your
business, but please be a “good
friend” and respect the choice that
others have made.

I’m not judging you, and I per-
sonally don’t care if you drink.

Seriously, who cares if you
destroy brain cells, do things
you will regret, or even kill your
liver?

I just don’t want to be at a party
and repeatedly badgered to drink
or to hear that my friends are, or
that some students aren’t going
out because they don’t want to be
forced to drink by those that they
care about, aka friends.

«Remember that friends don’t
ask other friends to drink when
they don’t want to.

Looking to lose
on election day

In this anti-incumbent election, neither party wants to win

By Abel S. Delgado
COLUM mm

The closer we get to Election
Day 2006, the more apparent it
becomes that both parties are
determined to lose.

As ridiculous as this sounds,
all signs point to a Democratic
party too afraid to take power
and a Republican party that
doesn’t want it anymore.

Let’s start with the Demo-
crats. In 2004 they could have
chosen John Edwards to run for
president.

Edwards was young, charis-
matic, relatively inexperienced
(meaning not a Washington
bureaucrat), relatively moder-
ate and able to cross party lines,
and, most importantly, south-
ern.

Basically, he ﬁt the same
mold that Bill Clinton did in
1992 and George W. Bush did in
2000, a formula proven to win
time and again.

Instead the Democrats chose
John Kerry, an old school “intel—
lectual liberal” from the North-
east. Name the last Northeastern
“intellectual liberal” president.
It might take you a while to go
that far back.

The Democrats had other
choices. If they wanted to beat
Bush at his own game, they
could have chosen Joe Lieber-
man, who is more Republican
than Bush and more pro—Bush
than many Republicans are.

.He would have gotten votes
from Republicans and from
people who refuse to vote Re-

publican, the two biggest voting
groups in the country.

If they actually wanted to
stand for something, they could
have chosen Howard Dean and
gone screaming into battle.

I’m not saying this would
have meant victory, but at least
it would have made things more
interesting.

Why would the Democrats
want to lose? Apparently they
had a crystal ball.

Just look at all that’s hap-
pened since November 2004:
Iraq has gotten worse, Afghani-
stan has taken a few steps back,
gas prices are so high people are
actually walking a few blocks to
get places, the world is worried
that birds are going to sneeze on
us and kill us off and the larg-
est natural disaster in American
history happened.

Of course, this is the presi-
dent’s fault entirely. It always
15.

So the crystal ball told the
Democrats to lose in 2004 to
receive no blame for things no
one is able to control anyway.
I ﬁgure the Democrats had the
same crystal ball right before
the Great Depression.

Now it seems the Republi-
cans have found their own crys-
tal ball. Things are probably go-
ing to get a lot worse. Why else
would the Republicans start a
huge ﬁght with each other based
on something decided in Gene-
va a long time ago?

Why else would they hide a
suspected pedophile Congress-
man until right before the elec-
tions?

Why else would they
choose Katherine Harris to
run for Senate in Florida?
Does anyone like Katherine
Harris? Does Katherine Har-
ris even like Katherine Har-
ris?-

The Republicans look
well on their way to losing
these mid—term elections.
They might just want to keep
traditions alive.

Second terms for presi-
dents are not supposed to go
badly; they’re supposed to go
horribly (i.e. Watergate, Iran-
Contra, Monica Lewinsky).

And the ruling party is not
supposed to win mid-term
elections, because people get
bored of seeing the same let-
ter behind everyone’s name.

So maybe the Repub-
licans want to lose just to
keep political history easy
enough for our textbooks to
simplify.

If the Republicans don’t
manage to lose this election,
it proves two things.

First, people will stub-
bornly vote for their party
regardless of what their party
does or doesn’t do.

Second, there are way too
many people like Katherine
Harris in the Democratic
Party}  ‘ ' ' """ 

Still don’t believe the
parties want to lose? Just
remember, whoever loses
in 2006 can just criticize
the winners in 2008 and not
actually stand for anything.
Isn’t that what party politics
is all about?

Press priorities
miss the mark

Election coverage focused on the wrong issues

Cowboy boots versus com-
bat boots.

Is that really the most im-
portant issue in Virginia poli-
tics today?

After reading local and na-
tional coverage of the Senate
race between George Allen
and Jim Webb, that’s certainly
how it seems.

We could care less about
the shoe choices of Allen and
Webb. It’s too bad we can-
not say the same of the press
corps covering this election.

Politics dominate the
news pages year-round these
days, so it’s hardly surprising
that trivial issues can come

The uninspired press corps
would rather recount Webb ’s
early opposition to coeduca-

than consider his plans for
Iraq.

Even Tim Russert, the
moderator of NBC’s “Meet
the Press,” couldn’t steer a
September debate on his show
away from character issues.

Russert asked the candi-
dates about Iraq and terrorism
but still had plenty of ques-

Does an article he wrote 27

Sadly, this isn’t the only
recent campaign being run on
ancient history.

What was the deﬁning is-

Iraq, Osama bin Laden or So-

It was Vietnam—a war that
ended 31 years ago.

And politicians wonder
why young voters don’t go to
the polls.

Why did the press focus on
Kerry’s swift-boat service and
Bush’s time in the National
Guard?

Because it was an easy
story guaranteed to sell news-
papers or attract television
viewers.

Because it was juicy and
full of gossip.

CBS News, in its rush to
scoop the competition, relied
on forged documents to ques-
tion Bush’s guard service.

Not only was the story ir-
relevant, it was inaccurate.

Enough overkill on juicy
political scandals. It doesn’t
matter if your business de-
partment thinks that scandal
sells well.

Journalists should serve
their audiences, not the al-
mighty dollar.

Abandon petty scandals
and focus on real issues.

Thank God for the ACLU

The ACLU says it speaks for the people, but does it really do what it says?

By Chris Tutor
COLUMNIST

Thank God for the American
Civil Liberties Union. Seriously,
America needs the ACLU. The
United States Constitution needs
the ACLU.

Without fail, the ACLU de-
fends the freedom of speech.
Without fail, it ﬁghts violations of
the Fourth Amendment. Without
fail, it protects the rights of the
accused. The list continues.

However, there is a problem.
Despite its many admirable ac-
tions, the ACLU often distorts the
Constitution and disregards the
intentions of the Framers.

Although the ACLU’s mission
is to “preserve...First Amend-
ment rights...the right to equal
protection...the right to due pro-
cess...and the right to privacy,”
it constantly contradicts itself re-
garding the constitutional role of
the government and often exalts
the judiciary over the electorate.

The ACLU seems to suffer
from a crisis of identity concem-
ing what the government can and
cannot do, particularly at the fed-
eral and state level.

Whatever your opinion on
each of these issues, the ACLU
displays a frustrating and alarm-
ing lack of consistency and rea-
son.

The ACLU maintains that the
government cannot criminalize
the sale of child pornography
(see the 1982 Supreme Court case
New York vs. Ferber).

According to the ACLU, the
government cannot criminalize
drugs. The government cannot

ban partial-birth abortion. Also,
the government cannot allow
a moment of silence in public
schools (Wallace vs. Jaﬁ°ree).

Simultaneously, the govem-
ment can force doctors, health
workers, hospitals and insurance
companies to perform or subsi-
dize abortions.

According to the ACLU’s
website, the government should
also order private employers and
schools to set “goals and timeta-
bles” for the hiring of under-rep-
resented groups.

Also, the government can
force private employers to cover
contraceptives and birth control
in health insurance programs.

Absurdly, the government can
also demand that the Boy Scouts
allow homosexuals to serve as
scout leaders.

The ACLU’s support for the
legal concept of corporate per-
sonhood further complicates its
contradictory position. Corporate
leaders maintain that corporations
possess many of the same consti-
tutional rights guaranteed to U.S.
citizens.

Therefore, the ACLU cannot
simultaneously justify an individ-
ual right to privacy and exempt a
corporate one.

To be consistent, the ACLU
cannot just pick and choose.

Where does the ACLU draw
the line regarding the proper in-
terference of the government?
How far does the right to privacy
extend? The ACLU does not pro-
vide a credible answer, only a
contradiction.

Obviously, there is only one
common factor behind the AC-

T he ACLU implements that agenda by consis-

tently undermining the voters. In effect, it uses

the judiciary as an alternate legislator Does it

take its issues to the ballot or the legislature?

LU’s contradictory positions on
the role of the government in
these matters: The ACLU uses
that role only when it promotes
its liberal agenda.

There is no constitutional stan-
dard. There is no logic. There is
only an agenda.

The ACLU implements that
agenda by consistently undermin-
ing the voters. In effect, it uses the
judiciary as an alternate legislator.
Does it take its issues to the ballot
or the legislature?

Rarely, because it would most
likely lose. Instead, the ACLU
ﬁles countless lawsuits to utilize
the courts to impose its ideology
on the electorate.

Would the Founding Fathers of
the United States agree with this
method? For the ACLU, it is ob-
viously a practical one, but does it
follow the spirit of the Constitu-
tion and our Republic?

On October 15, 1788, James
Madison, the principal architect
of the Constitution, wrote “as the
courts are generally the last in
making the decisions [on laws],
it results to them, by refusing or
not refusing to execute a law, to
stamp it with its ﬁnal character.
This makes the Judiciary depar-

ment paramount in fact to the Leg-
islature, which was never intended,
and can never be proper.”

According to Madison, judicial
usurpation is not the way our Re-
public was meant to operate.

The power of the people invest-
ed in their representative assem-
blies was intended to be greater
than that of unelected officials
serving as judges.

As I wrote at the beginning of
this article, the ACLU is good for
America.

Courageously and consistently,
it defends the constitutional rights
of such groups as the North Ameri-
can Man/Boy Love Association,
neo-Nazis and even the Ku Klux
Klan.

America needs the ACLU.
However, it is not fulﬁlling its mis-
sion.

It does not maintain a ratio-
nal, constitutional position on the
role of the government. It uses the
courts to implement its agenda, not
the people.

James Madison would not be
a card-carrying member of the
ACLU.

Neither would Jefferson. Nei-
ther would Hamilton. Neither am
I.

  Dragging out tolerance

2" he campus celebrates National Coming Out Week with mixed opinions

By Queenie Wong
STAFF wrmra

The most widely attended
event of National Coming Out
Week (NCOW), the drag show,
was cancelled Friday due to rainy
weather.

“The rain site wasn’t ideal and
we would have to cancel certain
services that we had planned for
so we just decided to cancel the
entire event,” said Gay-Straight
Alliance president Stephanie
Wiechmann.

Both the GSA and its law
school counterpart, OUTLaw,
sponsored the Third Annual Drag
Show.

The show, originally sched-
uled on the law school patio,
would have been moved to class-
room B, a more enclosed environ-
ment that lacked a stage. Based
on the ﬁgures last year, said
Wiechmann, the GSA and OUT-
Law were expecting a fairly large
audience that wouldn’t have ﬁt.

In the past, the drag show has
been held in the Moot Courtroom,
but because of renovations, it was
not available this year.

In addition, the serving of al-
cohol posed a problem. Accord-
ing to Wiechmann, the majority
of law school parties involve al-
cohol because the students are of
legal drinking age. The beer gar-
den that could have been outside
could not be set up inside a class-
room due to security problems.

Although no deﬁnite date has“

been announced, Wiechmann
said that the drag show will occur
sometime this year as a singular
event.

“The goal is to support those
who make a decision to come
out... and to let [Washington and
Lee] students know that there
are gay, lesbian, bisexual and
transgender students here,” said
Wiechmann. “Washington and

Lee is not immune to the outside
world and different alternative
lifestyles.”

Prior to the drag show, the
GSA and OUTLaw held other
events throughout the week to
promote coming out.

These events included pass-
ing out Skittles, hanging National
Coming Out Week posters, show-
ing the movie “Latter Days,”
urging students to vote, inviting
author Christian de la Huerta to
speak about his experiences in the
religious community, and holding
an ice cream social.

Reactions to NCOW have
been positive, for the most part,
Wiechmann said, praising the in-
volvement of the freshmen class.
“We’ve had a lot more freshmen
than usual at these events.”

However, not all students had
the same reaction. Arturo Roa, a
conservative Catholic and a fresh-
man at W&L, said, “The whole
concept of National Coming Out
Week revolves around the idea
that the homosexual lifestyle is
not a choice.

“It’s genetically predetermined
and it is irrevocable. I believe this
position is fallacious.

“To say homosexuality is ge-
netically determined is to say that
other positions such as alcohol-
ism are predetermined,” he said.
“If that were the case why not
have a National Alcoholic Com-
ing Out Week?”

The nature of celebrating gay
pride has also posed "questions
about its effectiveness in promot-
ing tolerance.

De la Huerta, author of the
critically acclaimed book “Com-
ing Out Spiritually,” agreed that a
drag show may have negative and
positive effects.

“Not only does it perpetuate
stereotypes, but it also puts wom-
en down,” said de la Huerta, who
graduated from Tulane University

Why should gay, lesbian, bi[sexual] and trans-

gender people mimic heterosexuals? After all,

they are notheterosexuals.

TED DELANEY, history professor

with a degree in psychology.

De la Huerta referred to Cali-
fornia governor Arnold Schwar-
zenegger’s comment about “girly
men” in the 2004 election as a
prime example.

“The reality is that the major-
ity of gay and lesbian Americans
don’t dress or look like that,” he
said I

Nevertheless, by pushing the
boundaries, organizations such as
the GSA are forcing others to deal
with these sensitive issues. Ac-
cording to de la Huerta, getting
the community to more readily
accept gays and lesbians requires
a multi-pronged approach.

The most effective method is
for gays and lesbians to come out
and reclaim their moral standing,
he said.

As for promoting tolerance
on the campus, de la Huerta had
three words to say: “Support the
GSA.”

Dr. Kirk Luder of University
Counseling also said he acknowl-
edged the possibility of a drag
show perpetuating gay and les-
bian stereotypes. ' i

M“ on‘ the ‘other 'lia'i1‘d, because it '

is a “deﬁant rejection of the so-
cial norm,” Luder said that this
extremity could be useful to the
gay and lesbian community, espe-
cially in a predominately conser-
vative campus like W&L.

Luder also cited conformity
and conventional thinking as ma-
jor problems facing the student
body.

Education is crucial in promot-

ing tolerance, Luder said.

Last spring term, W&L of-
fered History 353: Gay and Les-
bian Life in the 20th Century-
United States. History professor
Ted Delaney will teach the course
for a second time this spring.

“The course is important as a
means of breaking down stereo-
types and teaching the political
and social history of queer people
in 20th century United States,”
he said. “I hope the students
come away from the course with
the understanding that no stereo-
types apply. Gay men can either
be very masculine or very effem-
inate or variations of both.”

In regard to more extreme
forms of expression such as drag
shows and the Gay Pride Pa-
rade, Delaney emphasized the
thought-provoking questions
they bring up. A

“[It] challenges those of us to
look on and ask: Why does this
offend me? Why should gay, les-
bian, bi[sexual] and transgender
people mimic heterosexuals? Af-

ter all, they are not heterosexu-

als.”

Wiechmann agreed. ‘‘[The
drag show] is a way to step out-
side yourself for a night,” she
said, “to dress as the other gender
and to have fun in a safe environ-
ment without any inhibition.”

“I don’t think it perpetuates
the stereotype because the drag
culture is a part of the GLBT
[gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans-
gender] lifestyle that W&L stu-

dents never get to see,” she said.

Captured in
the limelight

NPR, History Channel call professors

By Julie Von Sternberg
STAFF wnman

National Public Radio and
the History Channel recently
invited two Washington and Lee
professors as guest speakers on
their broadcasts.

Classics professor Dr. Miri-
am Carlisle and Law professor,
Mark Drumbl were recognized
by the stations for their expertise
and intellectual energy.

As a classics professor, Carl-
isle has extensive knowledge of
Latin, Latin Literature and Ro-
man history, or what she likes to
call “ancient stutf.” She did not
gain this wisdom solely from the
classroom but also from person-
al experience.

“Her extensive background,
not only in her studies, but in her
travels and the people she’s met
really comes out in her teach-

. ing,” said senior Matt Krieg.

On campus, Carlisle is known
for having a laid-back attitude
and a genuine interest in her stu-
dents. Senior Matt Miller is one
of many students who appreci-
ate Carlisle’s personable teach-
ing style.

“She’s always willing to talk
to students about topics rang-
ing from translation problems to
questions of their future or life in
general,” said Miller.

In the summer of 2005, Car-
lisle exhibited the same enthusi-
asm when she agreed to appear
on the History Channel docu-
mentary “Sahara.” The show
provided an in-depth picture of
the development of the desert,
beginning during prehistoric
times.

During a three hour inter-
view, Carlisle provided detailed
descriptions of the wars fought
between Rome and Carthage,
the life of Roman soldiers and
the persecution of Christians.

“It was fun... surprisingly
fun,” recalls Carlisle.

Students who missed the doc-
umentary last year were excited
to hear of its re-showing. “I will
deﬁnitely be watching it on the
16th in hopes of gleaning some
more nuggets of wisdom from
Professor Carlisle,” said Clas-
sics major Matthew Loar.

Like Carlisle, professor Drum-
bl is well known on the W&L
campus for his enthusiasm and
teaching skills.

“With his passion, he brings
to W&L a contagious interest in
international affairs, wonderful
expertise and teaching ability, and
top notch specialists in the ﬁeld,”
says law student Nick Devereux.

In the classroom, Drumbl
uses the Socratic method to cre-
ate engaging discussions. “When
the class is tired and not partici-
pating, he gets visibly upset. He
starts yelling, ‘Come on people,
you have to have an opinion!’”
said Devereux.

In his book “Atrocity, Pun-
ishment, and International Law,”
Drumbl focuses on the connec-
tion between crimes against hu-
manity and the implementation of
international legal orders. In addi-
tion to international criminal law,
Drumbl’s teachings and research
include global environmental
governance, transitional justice,
contracts and comparative law.

Drumbl recently had the op-
portunity to share his opinions
on'an interesting issue of intema-
tional law. On Sept. 28, Drumbl
was invited to speak on National
Public Radio’s show “All Things
Considered,” where he ‘analyzed
the Nuremburg war crime trials

when military tribunals sentenced "

political, military and economi-
cal leaders of Nazi Germany. The
trials concluded 40 years earlier
from the date of his broadcast,

In his address, Drumbl criti-
cized the rulings at Nuremburg.
“Certainly there is much to cel-
ebrate in the Nuremburg judg-
ment,” he said. “However, tri-
als alone will not reconstruct a
shattered society. Trials will not
thwart the hatreds that give rise to
Sectarianism. Trials do not create
socioeconomic stability.”

These words provide just a hint
of the passion and excitement that
Drumbl exudes in the class room.

Both Drumbl and Carlisle
have had positive inﬂuences on
their students. Their discussions
on NPR provided the listening
public a rare opportunity to also
experience the educators’ knowl-
edge in and enthusiasm for their
respective subjects.

Women's Cross-
Country

The women dominated the
Virginia State Division II-III
Meet on Saturday, placing
ﬁrst out of 11 teams. Wash-
ington and Lee was led by
sophomore Jackie Burns,
freshman Katherine Telfeyan
and sophomore Becca Taylor,
who earned fourth, ﬁfth and
sixth places respectively. Also
in the top ten were freshmen
Dorothy Todd and Mary Fran-
cis Weatherly. The women
face Gettysburg college on the
road next Saturday.

Football

The Generals shut out Catho-
lic this weekend 28-0. Junior
Mark Snoddy caught two
interceptions, helping to keep
the Cardinals from advanc-
ing more than 100 yards

the whole game. Freshman
quarterback RJ Vamer com-
pleted 17 of 28 passes, and
Stuart Sitterson and Colton
Ward contributed 316 yards
combined. The team hosts
Hampden-Sydney on Saturday
at l p.m.

Men’s Soccer

After tying Virginia Military
Institute on Wednesday, the
Generals put another one
away on Saturday versus
Guilford College, winning
2-0. The men’s record now
sits at 10-0 for the ﬁrst time
in W&L history. Scoring for
the Generals were junior mid-
ﬁelder Josh Dodds and junior
forward Jack Palmer. The men
look to continue this streak
when they face Eastern Men-
nonite University on Wednes-

V day on the road.

Volleyball ,
The volleyball team did not
drop a game this week. Early
in the week, the Generals
defeated Lynchburg College
and Ferrum College 3-0, 3-0.
This weekend, they traveled to
Danville, Va. and beat all four
teams. The only tight match
was against Averett on Friday.
The Generals face Sweetbriar

there,” junior Natalie Day said.
“A lot of the upperclassmen were
really nervous, but I think she
appreciates that the value to the
team is more than just the play-
ing ability. There are a lot of team
leaders in the junior and senior
classes.”

After tryouts, Rankin decid-
ed to keep 20 on the roster. The
team also picked up new assistant
coach Eric Ishida. According to
Tabb, he has been a crucial asset
to the team.

“Our new assistant coach is
fabulous,” she said. “He’s done
a really good job at preparing us
for this weekend. He’s done a lot
to restructure our doubles, which
is good, because it is our weak
area.”

Tabb also said the team dy-
namic is forming extremely well.

“Everyone’s really positive
and motivating,” she said. “They
all really want to be out there.
That’s the big difference between
D-III and D-I—it’s not you’re job~
you want to be out there.”

For the ﬁrst time, the Generals
competed against Division I op-
ponents last weekend at the Vir-
ginia Tech Invitational.

“I think it’ll give us a good
chance to test ourselves in situ-
ations where we will be play-
ing better players,” junior Leah
Weston said.

“It’s a good opportunity to pre-
pare us for the Spring-to get us in
the mentality for harder matches
that are going to make us compete
our best and really have the will
to stay out there.”

if the team had a good enough
chance that season.

Despite the vested-interest ap-
proach that coaches are encour-
aged to take with their athletes,
O’Connell did note there is Uni-
versity policing about drinking
within athletics.

Said O’Connell, “We do have
a three-strike policy for our teams
that mirrors the University’s
three-strike policy for the frater-
nities and other organizations.”

On the ﬁrst strike that is as-
sessed against any given athletic
team, the players involved are
suspended.

This weekend in doubles play,
freshman Lauren Caire and Tabb
won the ‘B’ doubles ﬁnal when
they were pitted against team-
mates Weston and junior Ginny
Wortham in the ﬁnal round. Caire
and Tabb defeated the pair 8-6.

“We deﬁnitely try to take it
seriously, but we were both try-
ing to win the ﬂight of doubles,”
Wortham said.

Wortham also noted that the
match was more laid back and
that all four had fun.

Junior Rebecca Timmis and
partner, freshman Katie Bouret
were defeated in the ﬁrst round
by a team from the University of
Mary Washington 8-1.

The pair of sophomore Tori
Christmas and junior Kelly Will
met Caire and Tabb in the semi-
ﬁnal round and fell 8-0.

In singles competition, Timmis
won the D ﬂight 6-2, 6-4 against
teammate Weston. Wortham and
Will advanced to the semi-ﬁnals
in the C ﬂight but were both de-
feated by VT opponents.

Caire was eliminated by VT’s
Bethan James in the quarterﬁnals
of the C ﬂight, and Tabb was de-
feated in the ﬁrst round of the B

ﬂight by VT’s Natalie Kretzer.
Bouret and Christmas were both
eliminated by Mary Washington
competitors in the quarterﬁnals of
the D ﬂight.

“I think we were deﬁnitely
prepared,” Wortham said. “I think
we went in there with the mindset
that we had nothing to lose and
everything to prove.”

This tournament marks the end
of the fall season for women’s
tennis. They will return again in
the Spring with renewed energy.

Last Spring, the team beat Em-
ory 6-3 in the regular season.

“Last year, I liked playing
them duringthe season, because
our win against them gave us a lot
of conﬁdence going into Nation-
als,” Weston said.

“At the same time, it’s nice to
wait to play them, because that
way going into it, we won’t know
what to expect.”

Tabb said she looks forward to

the potential challenge.

“It’s always a nice indicator
of where we are in the season.
It won’t happen for a long time,
so we’ll have a chance to prac-
tice and improve before we get
there.”

establish rules

When a second strike is given,
the team will lose its off-season
practices.

So, for example, if the football
team was assessed two strikes, it
would not be allowed to practice
in the spring.

On the third strike, the team
forfeits their next season.

“Also,” said O’Connell, “one
important thing to remember
about this three-strike policy is
that it isn’t just effective over the
academic year, but for a 365-day
period, so it’s a little bit more se-
rious to get any strikes.”

Overall, however, there is an

Sports Beat team analyzes the effects of bad athletes

Andy: Hi, hello and welcome
to OutLoud, your weekly sound
off on the World of Sports, from
the Monday Night Sports Beat
team.

Just last week another report
surfaced that linked several more
baseball players to using perfor-
mance-enhancing drugs. And
still none of the major sports
have implemented strict enough
drug testing standards to crack
down on players that try to cheat
their way to success.

Is it the pressure of winning
and making millions of dollars
that drive athletes to try to ﬁnd
the shortcut and the easy way to
win? When did athletics become
all about winning? Sports serve
as a venue in which individuals
can learn life lessons.

Sports can teach a wide range
of lessons that can apply directly
to everyday life.

When athletes try to cheat their
way to success, they set up role-
model situation where children
believe that it is OK to bend or
break the rules.

When kids take shortcuts they
miss valuable lessons such as
learning how to work with others,
playing by the rules, and playing
the game the right way. These lost,
valuable lessons will haunt our so-
ciety by creating a world in which
it is OK to take the easy way out,
break the rules and along the way
avoid serious punishment.

Professional leagues and ath-
letes need to realize their role in
society and eliminate activities
that can set a negative example

for young athletes everywhere.
The leagues must severely crack
down on athletes that break rules,
making sure that the costs of us-
ing perforrnance-enhancing drugs
are so high that athletes will not
even consider using any banned
substances.

Athletes need to get back to
promoting work ethic and that
through work ethic anything can
be achieved. All is not lost. With
a few minor reforms both by the
leagues and the athletes, they can
regain the majesty that has domi-
nated American culture for the
past 100 years.

Neil: Steroids huh? Let the
rant begin. Well, the story with
steroids is this.... steroids exist,
they suck, they have no place in
sports, or in life really. That’s a

speciﬁcally isn’t——as O’Connell
put it~“enough of a problem to
be an issue.”

Said O’Connell, “My experi-
ence from talking to coaches and
administrators from other colleges
is that W&L is really no different
in terms of alcohol consumption
from other schools, we’ve just
been pegged with the reputation
as a party school.”

“Now, for us to think that
there’s any team that is in no way
involved in the consumption of
alcohol would be naive, but we’re
really no different from other
schools and other colleges across
the nation in terms of alcohol
consumption by athletes.”

This past week, Tennes-
see Titans’ defensive tackle
. Albert Haynesworth was
suspended ﬁve games by
the NFL alter he stomped
on the face of Dallas Cow-
boys’ center Andre Gurode.
It looked as if Haynesworth
‘was practicing the Polo ritual
of replacing the divots on the
field, except that the divot
was Gurode’s bare (non-hel-
meted) face. Gurode needed
 stitches to replaces his
own facial divot, and is cur-
rently deciding whether or
not to press charges.

Actions like this have
been taking place more and
more in sports over the last
few years. It was only a few
months ago that France’s
Zinedine Zidane seemed to
confuse Ita1y’s Marco Ma-
terazzi’s chest for the ball as
he headed him to the ground.
And it was only a few years
ago that Ron Artest, Jermaine

two months after the Pacers-
Pistons brawl, the Canucks’

his head into the ice, causing
spinal fractures, 21 concus-

fact. And I think that’s about all
that needs to be discussed about
steroids. Why must we keep talk-
ing about steroids, but do nothing
about it? Ban people who test
positive and that’s that.

I thinkwe need to start focusing
on bigger problems, like sports-
manship. Albert Haynesworth
can stomp on a guy’s bare face
and only get suspended 5 games?
How about Marcus Vick?

Or how about the Ohio State
player this year who intention-
ally twisted Michigan receiver
Steve Breaston’s leg at the end of
a play?

While some of these players
were punished for what they did,
others were not. This trend of vi-
olence is a much bigger problem
in sports than steroids is.

Or at least I think everyone
in the media, and the world, has
beaten the steroids story to death.

Let’s try and clean up our
sports on all levels. We can’t fo-
cus only on steroids, as we have
done so far. Haynesworth should
have been kicked out for the year.
Case closed.

I shouldn’t even mention ste-
roids, or poor sportsmanship,
when I can write about good
sportsmanship.

Baseball lost one of its ambas-
sadors when Buck O’Neil passed
away. A Negro Leagues legend,
as a player and coach, O’Neil in-
explicably fell short of making the
Baseball Hall of Fame. Unfortu-
nately O’Neil never got a chance
to play in the major leagues, but
did make his mark as a coach and
scout, discovering players such as
Lou Brock and Ernie Banks.

Steroids (and problems in gen-
eral) get the big coverage, and
maybe deservedly so (but not this
much).

The good people and good sto-
ries often get brushed aside. At
the end of the day, sports meant
to be for fun. As Andy wrote last
week, sports can be such a uniting
force.

With sports having so much
positive potential, why has it
turned into such a dividing and
negative force? I’m not com-
pletely sure‘ how things can be
ﬁxed  I wish I knew. What I
do know is that everyone is re-
sponsible. Players, fans, coaches,
everybody.

We cannot just sit back and ac-
cept rampant steroid use. We can-
not sit back and accept such ugly
breaches of sportsmanship.

These are the issues in sports
these days,and professional ath-
letes who are some of the most
visible people out there. Do your
part and help bring back sports to
the purists. Please.

Women record eleventh straight
shutout versus Catholic Saturday

By Lara Jordan
STAFF wmnzn

The women’s soccer team saw
huge success both offensively and
defensively in its shutout over
Catholic University on Sunday,
3-0.

With three goals in the ﬁrst
half from freshman midﬁelder
Roz Klann, junior forward Mar-
tha Caulkins and senior forward
Anne Wiltshire, the second half
saw little action.

The Generals
5¢0|'9 had 16 shots to

defense, only needing to making
one save.

“The defense played really
well against Catholic today,”
sophomore defender Sara Foster
Reeves said.

“We were challenged at the
back. They were a strong team.
We were deﬁnitely up to the chal-
lenge.”

Last Wednesday, the Generals
tied ODAC competition Guilford

W&L clearly dominated the

Guilford’s goalkeeper, Veroni-

Moreo attributes the team’s
successes to its chemistry, dedi-
cation and depth.

“Our team gets along really
well,” said Moreo. “We are all
friends, and we all joke around

constantly.”

“However, at the end of the
day, we are all willing to ﬁght for
each other to get a good result.”

The team is currently ranked
eighteenth in the nation with a
9-0-2 record after its victory over
Catholic on Saturday.

The Catholic game marked the
team’s eleventh straight shutout.

The defense has been a critical
part of the team’s success.

“I feel like we have a really
strong defense this year, and we
have come together really well at
the back,” Reeves said.

“We have a fairly young de-
fense. We’ve played really well
together so far.”

The team has several goals
this season, including winning in
ODAC competition.

“I think if the team continues
playing as well as we have been
playing, we have a great shot at
going to the NCAA’s [this year],”
Reeves said.

The team is hoping to accom-
plish this goal and is having a
strong start to the season.

“Since the seniors have been
freshmen, we haven’t won the
ODAC, so winning the ODAC is
a big and immediate goal,” said
junior Martha Caulkins.

“We have set ourselves up in
a good position winning opening
weekend, and we haven’t let any
goals in yet.”

The dedication of each team
member also contributes to the
strong record.

Alcohol in sports

Athletic director: coach claim consumption not pressing issue

By Cody Beauchamp
8 TA FF W R I TE R

The general consensus among
many athletes, coaches and ad-
ministrators is that drinking
among student athletes at Wash-
ington and Lee is no more of a
problem than alcohol consump-
tion for non-athletic students is.

One athlete, who requested
anonymity due to the sensitive
nature of the issue, said, “Yeah,
most athletes here drink—who
doesn’t? I think it’s a little mis-
leading to separate athletes from
the rest of the student body and
say ‘they drink a lot,’ because
there are plenty of non-athletes
who drink too.”

Echoing the sentiments of the
student, Interim Athletic Director
Chuck O’Connell said, “I don’t
think [drinking is] any more of an
issue for the athletic teams than it
is for the rest of the college.”

“Of course it goes on. For me
to sit here and say that none of
our athletes drink would be na-
'1've,” said O’Connell. But he said
he had a hard time thinking of any
incident where athletes showed up

to practice or a competition under
the inﬂuence of alcohol.

However, “athletes showing
up to practice while being affect-
ed by hangovers has occurred.”

Overall, O’Connell doesn’t
believe that alcohol has had a
detrimental effect on the competi-
tiveness of W&L’s athletic teams.

“Our coaches attempt to work
with our teams to address the way
that the athlete’s decisions off the
ﬁeld affect their performance on
the ﬁeld,” O’Connell said.

He explained that each in-
dividual team has rules about
alcohol consumption set by the
coach of that team and his or her
athletes.

“It’s really up to the individual
coaches to work with their ath-
letes to set the rules for the team,
and that’s where we’ll see rules
like the 48-hour abstention rule
that some teams will set for them-
selves,” he said. “Any violations
of those team rules are addressed
by the coaches. It’s really up to
them as to how they respond to
the violations.”

O’Connell said that allow-
ing the students to work with the

coaches to set their team’s rules
also had the effect of letting the
students “buy into” the rules.

One coach, who wished to re-
main anonymous so as to not im-
plicate his team’s members in any
illicit activity, said that the ap-
proach to setting the rules works
well in a way that allows the team
to be responsible in the way they
drink.

“We could sit here as coaches
and set hard-and-fast abstention
rules,” said the coach, “but this
way works out a whole lot better.
The way we do it now, the stu-
dents get to work with us to set
their own rules about when they
and their teammates can drink. It
keeps the coach from being some-
one who’s against the student
should they decide to participate
in the Greek social scene, because

the coach is just enforcing the.

rules they agreed upon.”

It also allowed the students to
determine how serious they want-
ed to take their sport, the coach
noted.

“It does vary from sport to
sport and from season to season,”
said O’Connell. “If your season is
going really well, you may want
to abstain and place winning and
having a good season over going
out to the parties.”

Many of the student athletes
interviewed agreed with the idea
that they would be willing to

starters.” said Moreo.

“Each of our players can go
into the game and continue or
improve what was done there be-
fore.”

Alumnus and
former professor
is sworn in as
26th president

By Cody Beauchamp
STAFF WRITER

Under Saturday’s cloudless
blue sky with a cool breeze blow-
ing, Ken Ruscio took Washington
and Lee’s presidential oath of of-
ﬁce.

The inaugural ceremony in-
cluded remarks from many mem-
bers of the W&L community
along with friends and colleagues
of Ruscio.

Ruscio concluded the cere-
mony by addressing the students,
alumni, faculty, friends and fam-
ily on the front lawn of Lee Cha-
pel.

The ceremony, which began at
10:30 a.m., was presided over by
Philip W. Norwood, the Rector of
the Board of Trustees for W&L,
from the class of 1969.

Speaking to the assembled
crowd, Ruscio shared some of his
W&L memories.

He spoke of his ﬁrst visit to
W&L with his father. a college
“he knew almost nothing about”
at the time.

“This particular , moment
would have been far from my
imagination then,” Ruscio joked
about assuming the presidency.

He also talked about being
happy to be back to Lexington,
having left it and W&L in 2002_
to assume the position of Dean
of the Jepson School of Leader-
ship Studies at the University of
Richmond.

“This is home,” he said, and
also said he was “proud to be
back.”

The majority of his speech
recalled some of the history of
W&L and focused on the values
of the liberal arts educational ap-
proach.

“It is humbling to consider the
legacies of past presidents and
consider how I should proceed
from there,” Ruscio said.

He was accompanied on the
speaking platform by ﬁve former
W&L presidents.

These men included Robert
Huntley, who graduated W&L
in 1950, W&L law in 1957, and
served as president from 1968-
1983; John Wilson, who served
from 1983-1995; H. Laurent
Boetsch Jr. from the class of
1969, who served as acting Presi-
dent from 2001-2002; and Tom
Burish, who served from 2002-
2005.

Harlan Beckley, who served as
acting president from 2005-2006,
was also present at the ceremony,

electing to join his colleagues in
the faculty.

Ruscio spent some time focus-
ing on the way the professional
education programs such as busi-
ness, law and journalism are in-
tegrated with the liberal arts ap-
proach to education at W&L.

He said they “come together in
the best way possible.”

Ruscio went on to say he hopes
that the university could leverage
this quality to become even more
of a leader among liberal arts in-
stitutions.

The president also addressed
the future of W&L, speciﬁcally
noting upcoming projects to re-
store the Colonnade, other build-
ing projects, and the continued
strengthening of the school’s
curriculum as goals he is looking
forward to overseeing during the
beginning of his term.

He also spoke of challenges
facing Washington & Lee.

Panel sets the theme of Ruscio is inaugural weekend

educators and alumni kicked off

. homecoming weekend on Friday

with a lively and often humorous
discussion of liberal arts in the
21*‘ century. '

Roger Mudd, a well-known
journalist and member of Wash-
ington and Lee’s class of 1950,
led a question-and-answer session
with Richard H. Ekman, Elizabeth
Kiss, and Pauline Yu.

Yu is president of the Ameri-
can Council of Learned Societ-
ies. Ekman leads The Council of
Independent Colleges, and Kiss
is the president of Agnes Scott
College.

New W&L President Ken
Ruscio introduced the panelists
and said he thought the panel
would shape discussion on the
W&L campus, not just during the
homecoming weekend, but for
years to come.

The panel discussed three top-

ems in  .Y.£.£l.iS-

cussed the role of faculty~scholar-
ship in a student-centered liberal
arts university, and Ekman talked
about the relationship between
professional education and liberal
arts.

Kiss concluded the prepared
statements by considering how
a liberal arts education imparts
values and promotes the develop-
ments of human intellect.

During the discussion on val-
ues, Kiss said that both she and
Ruscio often get calls from alum-
ni who want their schools to keep
tighter reign on their students’
moral behavior. Kiss said one
alumnus called W&L asking Rus-
cio to stop students from having
sex before marriage.

The panel agreed that no col-
lege or university should exercise
that type of control over their stu-
dents.

Kiss, however, argued that a
college could teach and model the
values inherent in the education
system.

“Ethical inquiry is at the heart
of liberal arts learning,” Kiss said.
“It is inescapable across the dis-
ciplines.”

She said liberal arts education
considers Socrates’ famous ques-
tion of “How ought we to live?”
Kiss followed up Socrates’ ques-
tion with one of her own.

“Do we need to have conver-
sations with students about how
they live their lives?”

morality in liberal arts, the panel

ﬁrst considered the teacher-schol-

Yu said that the teacher-scholar
model—where faculty members
do both instead of just one or the
other—is worth preserving.

After Mudd asked if one person

could be both a good teacher and
a good scholar, Yu argued that the
best faculty excelled at both. She
taught at several colleges, includ-
ing UCLA, Columbia University,
and the University of Minnesota
before taking her current job. Yu
argued that a true teacher-scholar
had broad intellectual horizons
and knew the past, present, and
future of their professions.
7 ]“You learn best from someone
who is, still leamingf; she said. ,.
Wlliletcher Lowe, who graduated
from W & L in 1954, said that he
remembers best the faculty who
combined the roles of teacher,
scholar, and moral character. His
remarks led several alumni to add
their agreement to that goal.

Ekman said liberal arts schools
beneﬁt from having faculty mem-
bers who are involved in their
students’ lives outside the class-
room.

Before opening the discussion
to questions, the panel considered
how the liberal arts ﬁt together
with professional education. As
the undergraduate journalism
school and the Williams School
of Commerce, Politics, and Eco-
nomics continue to grow at W&L,
the topic grows increasingly im-
portant.

Ekman said it was too easy-
but also incorrect—to assume that
there is an inevitable conﬂict be-
tween liberal arts and professional
education.

“The subjects we teach as lib-
eral arts change over time,” Ek-
man told the other panelists.

Yu said W&L and similar in-
stitutions need to see professional
and liberal arts as complementary,
not conﬂicting, ideas.

The ﬁnal question from the
audience set the tone for the pan-
el’s conclusion. Several people

wanted to know how they could
best explain the value of a liberal
arts education to people in the real
world.

One should keep graduating

the students one has been gradu-
ating and send them out as testi-
monies to this model of educa-
tion, Yu said.

Kiss said many large univer-
sities are now mimicking liberal
arts schools by creating smaller
colleges inside the larger univer-
sity. Ekman took some time dur-
ing the post-panel reception to
discuss another problem for lib-
eral arts schools: high costs.

“College is expensive,” Ek-
man said, “but most schools work
to control costs wherever they
can, and schools like W&L raise a
ton of money for scholarships.”

Ekman said American students

graduate with an average debt of ’

 J. .. .a-.....r... ..

“ls that an unreasonable ex-
pense?” asked Ekman. “I would
argue not.”

After the panel had ended,
Mudd discussed the values he
took from W&L into his profes-
sion.

‘ He served as the congressional
and national affairs correspondent
and weekend anchor for CBS’s
“Evening News” before working
as co-anchor of NBC’s “Nightly
News” and “Meet the Press.”

Mudd said W&L’s honor sys-
tem was the most valuable thing
he took away from his education.

“This honor system had a his-
tory to it that had lasted and got-
ten stronger through generations,”
Mudd said. “A man’s word was
his bond, and by God I wasn’t go-
ing to be the one to let [the sys-
tem] languish.”

Mudd said the values he took
from the honor system helped
him immensely when he went
into journalism.

He said he hopes the values that
he and his classmates cherished in
1950 are still important to today’s
students. While he said American
society and culture have changed,
he said W&L’s honor system re-
mains relevant.

“The values that W&L be-
lieved in then and now have not
changed,” Mudd said. “What the
honor system did then and now
is clear away the underbrush in
your relationships with people 
it makes everything cleaner and
clearer.”

Commons promotes artist .

Ron Herd, a Memphis artist, visited campus last Wednesday as a part of the “Common
Grounds’ series, which turns the Commons into a coffeehouse for a few hours.

While Tom Goss played the guitar, Herd greeted students and explained his theories on art. ‘‘I
use my art in particular to break down all types of walls and barriers that people put up,” he said in a

commons press release.

He also talked with different passersby about casual topics, like the upcoming NBA season
and college sports. His art, which he says is influenced by everyone from Vincent Van Gogh to Tupac,

“If we look beyond the bor-

“Our obligation is to model a
democratic culture of civility and
trust for them.”

“We should never underesti-

both the mind and the character
of our students, warned Ruscio.

. Reactions to the president’s
address were overwhelmingly
positive, with alumni, faculty
and students alike calling it “out-
standing,” “inspiring” and “ex-
cellent.”

For example, alunmus James
Parsons from the class of 1948
said, “It was an‘excellent speech
towards the greatness of W&L
and its future.”

Harold Howe, who graduated

at the thought of one of his class-

Lettingthe democrats have it_

Losing in November means Republicans have a chance at the White House when the election really matters

By Cody Beauchamp
c o LU M N I sr

t ﬁrst glance, things are
going horribly for the
Republicans.

Iraq is a complete ca-
tastrophe. Afghanistan is slipping
back into a state of instability
and violence. Congress is being
rocked by ethics scandals courte-
sy of Jack Abramoff’s illegal lob-
bying. The Bush administration
just took yet another broadside
from Bob Woodward’s new book
“State of Denial.”

To really take the cake, one
of their own, former Congress-
man Mark Foley, has completely
alienated the evangelical Chris-
tian faction of their base by pull-
ing a Michael Jackson on teen-
aged congressional pages.

And yet the Republicans
couldn’t be in a better position.

I know it sound nuts, but hear
me out. The Republicans are
golden... in 2008.

It’s an all but sure thing that
the GOP will lose their majority
in either the House or the Senate,
or both.

But this is precisely where

I... aura-« .._

the light at the end of the tun-
nel comes for the Republicans.
They’re going to get a break from
being in charge.

They need it.

Whenever things go wrong in
politics, it’s always the party in
charge that catches the heat.

Look at what happened in
1932. Furious at President Hoover
and the Republicans’ inability to
end the Depression, voters _swept
FDR and Democratic majorities
in both Houses into power.

In 1980, with gas prices soar-
ing and the Iranian Hostage Cri-
sis unresolved after nearly a year,
Ronald Reagan soundly beat J im-
my Carter, bringing a Republican
Senate Majority with him.

In 1994, Newt Gingrich’s
“Contract with America” capital-
ized on long-running Democratic
slips and scandals, mobilized vot-
ers, and gave the Republicans
control of both Houses of Con-
gress.

And so on.

The bottom line is that if things
aren’t going well, the heads in
charge tend to roll.

This is certainly the case this
election.

LIF

T he diﬂerence is, it ’ll be 2008
and the White House will be up
for grabs along with Congress.

There are multiple Senate rac-
es where the incumbent Republi-
cans are expected to lose: Jim Tal-
ent in Missouri; Conrad Burns in
Montana; Mike DeWine in Ohio;
Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania;
Lincoln Chafee in Rhode Island.

The House is much the same
story. An Oct. 2 CNN/ORC poll
shows Democrats leading the
Republicans by an average of 11
points nationwide.

Slate’s Election Scorecard
(as of last Friday) is predicting
Democrats will unseat Republi-
can incumbents in the 8th district
in Arizona, the 7th in Colorado,
2nd, 8th and 9th in Indiana, 11th
in North Carolina, 1st in New
Mexico, 26th in New York and
10th in Pennsylvania while win-
ning open races in the 16th dis-

trict in Florida, 24th in New York,
and 15th in Ohio.

. So why is this impending wave
of losses such a good thing for the
Republicans?

Because it sets them up per-
fectly to win the White House
again in 2008.

Right now the Democrats
aren’t really running as Demo-
crats. They’re running as anti-
Republicans. This is ﬁne for now.
It will most likely capitalize on
voter frustration and swing con-
trol of Congress back to the left
of the aisle.

But what then? With no real
solutions of their own to any of
the major issues, the Democrats
will ﬁnd themselves facing the
same criticisms the Republicans
currently are facing.

The difference is, it’ll be 2008
and the White House will be up
for grabs along with Congress.

The war in Iraq will still be
going horribly. Oil shortage prob-
lems still won’t have been solved.
Iran will likely have nuclear
weapons by then (North Korea
apparently already does). We’ll
still be seeing threats from terror
cells worldwide. Et cetera.

So in two years we’ll be seeing
the same things happening—an—
gry at the lack of leadership from
the party in control, we’ll play
another round of “vote the bums
out.”

Only this time, it’ll be the
Democrats getting the boot.

The problem for the Democrats
will be when they get the boot—a
presidential election year.

Anyone doubt that Bush would
be unseated if he were running
NOW? Didn’t think so.

Anyone think that voters frus-
trated with a lack of progress
from the Democrats in Congress
will still be willing to vote blue in
when it comes to the next presi-
dent? Exactly.

the next one. Whether or not they
want it, the Republicans are about
to let the Democrats try their hand
at leading Congress.

And the Democrats are going
to self-destruct.

The GOP has platforms and
ideas that they want to see hap-
pen. The Democrats only have
one idea: gripe about the GOP’s
leadership.

Name the potential Republi-
can candidates for president: John
McCain, Rudy Giuliani, Bill Frist,
Mitt Romney, Condi Rice-—the
list goes on.

Now try naming Democrats
with a shot. Mark Warner? Not
anymore. John Edwards? Maybe.
Nancy Pelosi? Harry Reid? John
Kerry? Hillary? I scoff.

The bottom line is that one
of two things has to happen for
Democrats to win in 2008.

It won’t be enough to be the .

anti-Republicans in 2008, espe-
cially not if they get two years in
charge.

Either they have to miracu-
lously snatch defeat from the jaws
of victory in 2006 or they have to
actually start having some ideas
for how they want to govern.

- explosive ﬁnds

Baker commission on Iraq delays results after election

By Dylan Merrlll
c o L u M N I s r

Clearly, victory in Iraq is im-
possible.

Many Democratic members
of Congress have held this view
since the beginning of the insur-
gency, and their patriotism has
consequently been under ques-
tion.

Their detractors have unfairly
accused Democrats of aiding ter-
rorists and impeding the spread of
democracy. Contrary to conserva-
tive notions, though, Democrats
have not been having sleepovers
with Osama bin Laden, and they
probably haven’t pledged their al-
legiance to the Dark Lord.

Grandpa Cheney and Uncle
Bush have repeatedly alluded
(sometimes not so subtly) that the
Democrats want to gain a major-
ity in Congress this November so
that they can misguide America
even further.

In reality, however, many
Americans want a change in
Iraq foreign policy, and they are
no longer willing to “stay the
course.” In addition to Demo-
crats, many politicos, even some
of Bush’s conﬁdants, from both
sides want a change in Iraq for-
eign policy.

The Iraq Study Group, whose
10 members are headed by the
ﬁrst Bush’s Secretary of State
James Baker, is developing a
report on what is the most effec-
tive course of action in Iraq. The
commission, which was initiated
by congressional Republicans and
sanctioned by the White House,
will most assuredly advocate a

Contrary to conservative notions,
Democrats have not been having
sleepovers with Osama Bin Laden.

change in direction.

Their two main options will
shift focus on either stabilizing
Iraq or withdrawing troops in
multiple phases. Both alternatives
of the supposedly bi-partisan
commission reject the notion that
our efforts can cultivate democ-
racy in Iraq.

Luckily for Republican sup-
porters of “staying the course,”
the ﬁndings of the Iraq Study
Group will not be released until
after the election. The excuse
for this clever cover-up is that the
conclusion of the group’s research
is too “politically explosive” to
release before Nov. 7. If only the
Bush administration was as adept
at preventing explosions in Iraq.

After all, the war is the most
important issue in the upcoming
midterm elections. If the com-
mission’s ofﬁcial ﬁndings pub-
licly rebuked the current policy
before the elections, congressio-
nal Republicans would have no
chance to save face.

Their well-funded campaigns
would go under like a storm-rav-
aged luxury yacht succumbing to
the deep blue sea. And the results
would be fatal, because Mark
Foley stole the life rafts a couple
of weeks ago, and Democrats will

I scapegoating Baker,

conveniently forget how to swim.

Fortunately for right-wingers,
their president has delayed their
demise until after Nov. 7.

The results of the commission
will be released after the elec-
tions, but this still does not lessen
the negative impact the ﬁndings
will have on Republicans. Those
conservatives that avoid the com-
mission’s political gunﬁre this
election will still have to bite the
bullet in 2008 and face their con-
stituents.

This is not even the extent of
the GOP’s worries. The Iraq war
will continue to be the deﬁning
issue during the next presidential
election.

If George Bush does not re-
linquish his ideological dogma-
tism and adopt the ﬁndings of the
Baker commission, voters will
look at the quagmire in Iraq and
ensure that his replacement is a
Democrat.

Will the president stoop to
a family
friend, or will he adopt the ﬁnd-
ings of the commission and ﬁnal-
ly alter the course in Iraq? The
Republican party’s power is con-
tingent on his actions.

So is the vitality of the Ameri-
can people.

Mass murder in Darfur

A look into whether we should interfere with a repeat of the Holocaust

Darfur has been embroiled
in a deadly conﬂict for over
three years.

At least 400,000 people have
been killed,‘ more than 2 million
innocent civilians have been
forced to ﬂee their homes and
now live in displaced-persons
camps in Sudan or in refugee
camps in neighboring Chad

More than 3.5 million men,
women, and children are com-
pletely reliant on international
aid for survival.

Not since the Rwandan geno-
cide of1994 has the world seen
such a calculated campaign of
displacement, starvation, rape,
and mass slaughter

Since early 2003, Sudanese
armed forces and Sudanese gov-
ernment-backed militia known
as “Janjaweed” have been ﬁght-
ing two rebel groups in Darfur:
the Sudanese Liberation Army/
Movement (SLA/SLM) and the
Justice and Equality Movement
(JEM).

The stated political aim, of
the rebels has been to compel
the government of Sudan to ad-
dress underdevelopment and the
political marginalization of the
region.

In response, the Sudanese
governments regular armed
forces and the Janjaweed
— largely composed of ﬁghters
of Arab nomadic background
~ have targeted civilian popu-
lations and ethnic group from
which the rebels primarily draw
their support — the Fur, Masalit
and Zaghawa.

The UN has peacekeeping
missions around the world.

And yet there is still no sig-
niﬁcant mission to speak of in
Darfur. Why?

Because the Sudanese gov-
ernment, the very same gov-
ernment that is carrying out the
genocide, can legally block a
peacekeeping mission aimed at
stopping genocide.

People are dying in Darfur,
and we do nothing.

We elect our leaders to be
the leaders of the free world. In
the past few years Congress has
taken an aggressive stance on
the right to speak nonsense in
order for a bill not to pass — ﬁli-
buster - when 15,000 Darfurians
are silenced each month.

They have fought to the bit-
ter end for one woman’s right to
live on life support when there
are hundreds of thousands of

Darfurians who have no real life
to support.

The Bush Doctrine wel-
comes democracy in the trou-
bled areas of the world and this
is wonderful. But isn’t a more
immediate matter the protection
of life itself?

People are dying in Darfur,
and we do nothing.

So we fast, we raise money,
we listen to rich celebrities and
we “contribute to the cause.”

All this is well and good, but
are we really doing something?
They’re still dying in Darfur and
as long as the inhumane beasts,
for lack of a crueler word, are in
power, people will die.

We are the strongest nation
this world has ever seen.

With one swift attack we’ve
taken down entire armies. With
a few words of encouragement
and some aid, we have helped
millions of people obtain free-
doms once thought impossible.

We can and have a responsi-
bility to stop genocide, to eradi-
cate those who eradicate.

Do we not have the power,
the right, and the obligation to
stop this?

Or is that we just don’t have
the will?

People are dying in Darfur.
Let’s do something.

sentiments

Staff writer Julie Von Stem-
berg interviews various alumni
about their experiences back
on campus. Some offer nos-
talgic emotions while others
speak of how the college tradi-
tions have changed since their

years at the university.

Homecoming Football Game

On Saturday afternoon, alumni cheered
on another General’s victory. The Washing-
ton and Lee Generals crushed the Gilford
Quakers 34-12, making them six and one for
the season. During halftime, Kathekon mem-
bers Jordan Wesley and Palmer Dobbs con-
ducted the traditional homecoming presenta-
tion. Before announcing homecoming queen,
W&L’s oldest alums, including 89-year-old
Charles Luther Guthrie Jr., were honored
by fans. Guthrie presented the homecoming
envelope that revealed Shari Boyce as third
runner up, Camille Allen as second runner
up, Katy Kingsbury as ﬁrst runner up and
Meghan Joss as queen. Jim Ferrnald, of the

class of 1973, named several things that have changed about the game since
he was a student. “First of all, everyone didn’t leave during halftime. That is
quite different. Also, the presentation has changed. When I was here, chemistry
professor Shilington always presented the homecoming queen envelope. His
eccentric personality made him perfect for the job,” says Fermald.

 

Seeing Old Friends

For most alumni,
being reunited with old
classmates is the best
part about coming back
to Washington and Lee.
A variety of activities
such as the Inaugural
Lunch and the Five Star
General Reception gave
alumni the opportunity
to come together in cel- .
ebration of their time
here. During these gath-
erin_gs, classmates were
able to reﬂect on old times as well as learn about each
other’s lives after graduation. Mark Grobmyer, who
graduated last year, appreciates the chance to see his
old classmates. “The best thing about being back is the
atmosphere,” said Grobmyer. “It’s great to be in a care-
free environment and with 50 of your best friends. That
doesn’t happen very much now that we’ve graduated.”

Up ‘til Dawn funds research

Students write letters, organize fundraisers to earn money to support children is cancer research at St. Jude Hospital

By Queenle Wong
surr wrmsn

Every year, the campus orga-
nization Up ‘til Dawn conducts a
series of fundraisers to encourage
cancer research at St. Jude Hospi-
tal in Memphis, Tenn.

The organization, currently
headed by Executive Director Erin
Vaughn, plans to raise $35,000 by
the end of this year.

Up ‘til Dawn, according to
stjude.org, is a student-led ﬁind-
raiser hosted by over 150 colleges
and universities nationwide. Since
its creation in 1998, the program
has generated close to $3 million.

Amanda Eysert, a Washington
and Lee graduate, established the
campus chapter last year. Despite
its late start, the organization suc-
cessfully raised $20,170, said
Vaughn.

The funds were donated to the
American Lebanese Syrian As-
sociated Charities (ALSAC), the
primary fundraising group for St.
Jude.

The organization is comprised
of 10 or 11 executive board mem-
bers, who recruit volunteers from

W&L’s Greek community. The
volunteers are then organized into
different ﬁindraising teams. These
teams are given the opportunity to
conduct their own activities.

Sophomore and former team
leader Rosemary Boyle helped
raise approximately $1,000 last
year by selling rafﬂe tickets. With
the help of 25 W&L students, par-
ticipants in the fundraisers won
dates, said Boyle.

Although a similar fundraiser
has yet to be scheduled, Boyle
said that it will probably occur
sometime after Thanksgiving
break.

Another one of Up ‘til Dawn’s
major ﬁandraisers is a letter-writ-
ing night. During the event, stu-
dents write letters to their friends
and relatives, encouraging them
to make a donation to ALSAC.

Sophomore Jennifer Lysenko,
who spoke about her cousin’s
battle with cancer last year, was
pleased with the huge number of
participants that attended.

The event will be held this
Tuesday, Oct. 24 at 7 p.m. in
Evans Dining Hall. All students
are welcome to participate, said
Vaughn.

Nonetheless, in order to en-
sure attendance, students are
also asked to register prior to the
scheduled date. Students may
register by e-mailing Vaughn or
simply showing up on Tuesday.

According to Assistant Direc-
tor Kelly Harvey, Up ‘til Dawn is
expecting approximately 100 stu-
dents to attend this function.

The organization is thinking of
instituting a second letter-writing
event in January.

With funding from the Execu-
tive Committee, the organization
is able to conduct other fundrais-
ers as well, said Harvey. These
include selling baked goods and
$15 on campus. All proceeds go
directly to ALSAC, she said.

During spring term, Up ‘til
Dawn ends their fundraising year
by literally staying up until dawn,
said Boyle. '

Last year, the event, -which
celebrates the organization’s

achievements, was held at the
school gym and included a band
among other activities. This tradi-
tion is celebrated nationwide and
is where the organization’s name
arose from, states the website.

In addition to its fundraising
aspects, the organization strives
to promote cancer awareness
throughout campus.

“lt’s about bringing the W&L
community together and letting
[the students] know that there
are bigger problems out there,”
Vaughn said.

Harvey stressed the leader-
ship aspect of the organization in
her interview, stating that Up ‘til
Dawn “allows students to take on
small leadership roles.”

St. Jude, according to its web-
site, is unlike any other hospital
because it treats admitted patients
regardless of their ability to pay.
This makes St. Jude the third
largest health care charity in the

“During the past ﬁve years,
83.7 percent of every dollar re-
ceived by ALSAC/St. Jude has
gone to the current or future needs
of St. Jude,” states the site.

According to Vaughn, the
campus chapter of Up ‘til Dawn
is continuing to grow.

This year, the organization,
which consists of 20 fundraising
teams, plans to host a total of ﬁve
fundraisers, she said.

Said Harvey, “We know
that the money is going to good
hands.”

THE RING-TUM PHI ° 9

Senior exhibits rare talent

Abbie Jackson spends summer months researching university archaeology, revamping previous exhibition

By Jessica Shaw
ARTS AND LIFE EDITOR _5

Over the summer, some stu-
dents embarked on various intern-
ships, and others held down nu-
merous jobs. Some worked with
children at summer camps, while
still others studied abroad.

For senior Abbie Jackson, last
summer was not spent at a typi-
cal summer job or a doctor’s of-
ﬁce. For two months, Jackson
remained on campus to conduct
archaeological research involving
the history and development of
Washington and Lee.

“Coming to college, I wanted
to work in a museum, so this was
the perfect combination of inter-
ests,” Jackson said.

Under the guidance and super-
vision of Archaeology professor
Laura Galke, Jackson completely
revamped the previous archaeol-
ogy exhibit located in the Anthro-
pology Lab by the Liberty Ruins.
Jackson’s exhibit opened to the
public last Friday.

“It’s deﬁnitely a great oppor-
tunity that everyone should look
into,” Jackson said.

“The goal was to have it de-
signed so that in the future it
could be implemented by a pro-
fessional, but the fact that it’s in
is kind of surprising. It was nice
to see my work complete—to see

the panels life-size.”

According to Jackson, the mis-
sion of the project was to refurbish
the old research and artifact lay-
out as well as complement it with
subsequent research and ﬁndings
from the spring Archaeology Dig
she participated in in 2005.

, “We were redoing the exhibit
which focused on the Liberty Hall
excavations of the 1970s,” she
said. “The goal was to incorpo-
rate the Newcomb excavations of
2005 to show that campus archae-
ology is not dead.”

Jackson began her work in late
June and ﬁnished in mid-August.
She said there was no strict out-
line for her project.

“We had a general plan for the
summer, and I just went at it," she
said. “I did historical research on
the college using the Board of
Trustees records, the Lexington
Gazette [and] the old Phi article.

“Then, I moved onto my inter-
site analysis, which was between
the Ruins and the Newcomb ex-
cavations, because both buildings
had similar uses.”

Galke, who is in her fourth
year at W&L, said that after the
Dig, she knew Jackson would be
a great student for such a project.

“During the Dig, I had iden-
tiﬁed her as a student I wanted
to work with,”’ Galke said. “She
was a hard worker. She was intel-

ligent. She had the right attitude.
She’s critical and skeptical, [and]
she doesn’t accept things at face
value.”

The Robert E. Lee grant that
funded Jackson for her research
and efforts this summer was sup-
plemented by the generous assis-
tance of Leybum funds.

“A lot of people helped us,”
Galke said. “We could not have
done it alone.”

Galke also said that the com-
mitment of Anthropology profes-
sor Dr. Bernard Means was criti-
cal to get the exhibit renovations
underway.

“He helped supervise the dig
beside Newcomb in 2005,” she
said. “He already was familiar
with the collection, and he was
familiar with my work. His dedi-
cation [was crucial in] translating
Abbie’s ﬁles into a format that
they could be manufactured.”

Jackson said another goal of
this project is illustrating how the
archaeological evidence collected
affects the validity of historical
documents. She is also eager for
others to get a true understanding
for the campus and its history.

Galke said she hopes that “vis-
itors that come here take away an
appreciation for how important
the university’s history is and
how much the university cares
about preserving it.”

Students take 48-hour plunge

Nine volunteers spend weekend in D

By Jessica Shaw
ARTS AND LIFE EDITOR

Every morning, John rises ear-
ly to board a bus from D.C. for an
hour and a half to his job at Bob
Evans in Northern Virginia. In a
starched, collared shirt and neatly
combed hair, John waits tables
and cleans dishes all day. Aﬁer
work, he returns to his home on
the street by 10 p.m. Before bed,
he collects the blankets he keeps
hidden in the bushes in the me-
dian of a city street in a futile ef-
fort to stiﬂe the wind and freezing
temperatures.

Over reading days, nin’e Wash-
ington and Lee students spent the
night with John in an empty space

“I can’t even imagine

that being your way
of life--with no indi-
cation if or when you
will ever get out of it. ”

KASEY BOLLES, participant

~ between two buildings. For two

nights, these young people were
thrust into devastating poverty
and forced to cope with many of
its elements. This national pro-
gram termed the Urban Plunge
made its debut this fall at W&L,

‘‘I wanted to get a deeper un-
derstanding of homelessness from
the perspective of a homeless
person,” sophomore participant
Rosemary Boyle said. “Home-
lessness is the extreme case of
poverty where the basic needs of
shelter and food are a day-to-day
concern.”

Sophomore Michaela Coffey
was in charge of this opportunity
and split the team up into pairs for
their stay in D.C. These students
left campus the Thursday of read-
ing days at 8:30 a.m. with nothing
but a set of ragged clothes.

Sophomore participant David

Vaught said that he and his part-
ner, sophomore Alden Wicker,
found some piles of ashes around
the Georgetown campus and used
them to rub over their faces and
skin and improve the credibility
of their outﬁt.

“Alden and I spent a good bit
of time the ﬁrst afternoon going
‘we’re still not dirty enough yet,”’
Vaught said. “We kept improving
our costume. There was one point
where we pulled out a knife, and I
cut some holes in the ankles of my
pants to make them look older.”

During the day, the pairs stood
on corners in D.C. with cardboard
signs, panhandling for money.
Some groups also sold the home-
less magazine, Street Sense, to
passersby.

“Being homeless is almost like
a full time job,” junior participant
Woodrow Friend said. “I didn’t
really expect that. Panhandling
all day long was not anything that
was easy. A lot of people give you
nasty looks or stare. One person
said something like, ‘I don’t give
money to street trash.’”

Vaught said the only time he
almost broke character was in re-
sponse to some boys while pan-
handling.

“I saw these two guys that
didn’t look much older than me,”
he said. “I just got mad by the way
they ignored me. They would look
at me and see no obligation to do
something. For some reason, that
really bothered me.”

Later in the afternoon, Boyle
and her partner, Friend, gathered
on a street corner with a small
crowd to wait for McKenna’s
Wagon, which serves dinner to
the homeless.

Boyle noted the parting re-

marks from the delivery man that '

seemed to accentuate the cycle of
poverty.

“When he was packing up to
leave, he said, ‘see you all tomor-
row.’ He knows that everybody is
going to be back,” she said.

When asked about their own
situations, each pair had to invent
some sort of response.

“I basically tried to avoid the
question,” Friend said. “I usually

did that by asking another ques-
tion. I kind of thought the sim-
plest thing I could think of was
best. I thought being more distant
about your situation being home-
less was more in character.”

After dinner, the group of
nine divided into two groups for
the evening. One group spent
the night with a homeless couple
in the woods on the outskirts of
town while the other convened
with John to sleep on the street.
The two groups rotated for the
second night.

Vaught’s group spent the night
with John the ﬁrst night.

“He looked really clean for
a homeless man,” Vaught said.
“The way he was dressed and
the way he was clean, he could
have passed for a lower—middle
class citizen-someone who had
been wearing the same clothes
for a day or two and a little dirty.
You didn’t look at him and think
‘homeless’ for sure.”

Both nights, the temperatures
dropped to levels that bordered on
freezing. Vaught said he slept the
ﬁrst night with an oversized piece
of cardboard positioned over him
to block the wind.

“I put newspaper in my shoes,
and I put my feet in a trash bag
I had been carrying around all
day,” he said.

Sophomore participant Kasey
Bolles said John’s situation had
arisen from excessive misfortune.

“He used to live in North or
South Carolina, and one night his
house burned down to the ground,
and he lost everything,” she said.
“He can’t afford the cost of living
where he is, but he can’t afford
to go anywhere else, so he’s just
stuck.”

Boyle said that she noticed
John had a strong desire to rise
out of poverty.

“He was having a tough
week,” she said. “To hold down
a job, he is facing a huge amount
of obstacles daily. He hopes soon
that he will be able to get some-
where to live.”

The other location, out of
town, had to be reached via the
Metro. The homeless couple that

the groups stayed with, Michelle
and Zoe, slept in tents in a wood-
ed area.

Vaught described the arrange-
ment saying, “they had palates on
the ground to put tents on and had
a campﬁre and a few egg crates
with a board across it to sit on.”

Vaught said the couple had
bought some marijuana and al-
cohol that day, and Zoe had alco-
holic tendencies.

“He slept until ll o’clock the
next day and got up and went to
the liquor store to get something,”
Vaught said.

Referring to homeless people,
Vaught said, “They do have a
life to live with struggles to go
through, and while some deﬁnite-
ly do drugs, I came away thinking
I don’t want to judge that in the
ﬁrst place.”

Vaught said he believed the
plight of the homeless was much
deeper than an addiction.

“I didn’t feel like drugs was
the root of the issue—maybe part
of it,” he said. “It’s not that people
who don’t do drugs are better at
getting out of homelessness; it’s
the people who want to get out
of homelessness ' that don’t do
drugs.”

According to Boyle, D.C. has
a lot of organizations that help ﬁx
the symptoms of homelessness
but few that actually work to cure
it permanently.

“There are plenty of organiza-
tions that provide food, but as far
as equipping the person with the
ability to escape homelessness, I
didn’t encounter any,” she said.

Vaught said that this trip has
changed his view of poverty.

.C. to be immersed in homelessness, try to gain fresh perspective on poverty

“I don’t ever want to overlook
a homeless person sitting there
panhandling,” he said. “These
people are poor and needy. It’s
a chance to notice somebod --
they get overlooked their whole
lives.”

Bolles agreed that she learned
a lot from her experience but ac-
knowledged that 48 hours was not
enough time to establish complete
empathy for the homeless.

Said Bolles: “You don’t real-
ize how vulnerable you are until
you are out there,” she said. “It
was enough to take the blinders
off, but it was not enough to get
[an] understanding [of what it is
like] to live that way indeﬁnitely.
I can’t even imagine that being
your way of life—-with no indica-
tion of if ‘or when you will ever
get out of it.”

The Washington and Lee
women’s volleyball team
clinched their ninth-straight
20-win season, improved
their record to 21-6 overall
and kept their perfect 9-0 re-
cord in ODAC competition.
This weekend the Generals
defeated Bridgewater College
30-26, 19-30, 30-25, 31-29,
and Eastern Mennonite 30-20,
30-17, 30-24. In their victory
over Bridgewater, the Gener-
als were led by senior libero

her own school record with
33 digs.

Fleld Hockey

The Washington and Lee ﬁeld
hockey team scored another
big conference victory this
weekend, before having their
seven game winning steak
snapped by sixteenth-ranked
Christopher Newport. The
Generals defeated ODAC
powerhouse Virginia Wesley-
an 2-1 on Saturday, with Liz
Garson and Kay Dyt scoring
goals. The Generals will take
their undefeated ODAC re-
cord upon against rival Lynch-
burg College on Tuesday,
where the conference regular
season championship will be
on the line.

Men's Soccer

The Washington and Lee
men’s soccer team relied on
a second half barrage of four
goals, to shut out Randolph-
Macon 4-O, improving their
record to 11-1-2 and 6-1-1 in
ODAC play. The Generals
were led by goals from Jack
Palmer, Alex Phillips, Whitt
Larkin, and Travis Short. The
Generals will close out their
regular season on Wednesday
when they take on Lynchburg
College.

Women’s Soccer

The Washington and Lee
women’s soccer team contin-
ued their l6-game undefeated
streak, knocking off Roanoke
College 2-1. It was only the
ﬁrst goal that the Generals had
allowed for the entire season.

as EMU is ranked ﬁfth overall
in the Adidas/NSCAA coaches
poll,;the Generals are l7“‘) to ac-
complish the impressive feat of
not allowing a single goal in the
entire regular season.

The streak is impressive in
itself, but it doesn’t overshadow
the overall spectacular season
the Generals have enjoyed. The
streak just adds greater distinction
for a team that has yet to lose, and

on Tuesday faces its biggest game
of the season, home at Watt Field
at 4 p.m.

The ODAC has come down to a
triangular race between Guilford,
ECU and W&L, with W&L sitting
in third with 28 conference points
through ten ODAC games. ECU
is second with 27 points through
10 games, and Guilford sits atop
the conference with 28 points,
although their regular season is
over and their destiny is now out
of their hands. Everything hinges

on the game on Tuesday.

With a win, W&L wins the
division outright with 29 points
(three points are awarded for a
win and one for a tie).

With a tie, W&L will ﬁnish
third, and the division will be
sorted out through a tie breaker
between the other two. If past
performances are an indication
of how Tuesday will turn out,
the Generals tied Guilford 0-0 on
Oct. 4‘, and Guilford lost to EMU
3-2 on Sept.20. EMU will not be

intimidated by the Generals’ for-
midable defense.

W&L will rely on the same
cast it has relied on all season.

Forming the backbone of the
team are their eight seniors: Em-
ily Binns, Cara Burton, Jamie
Dorsey, Maggie Megear, Huntley
Rodes, Blair Haws, Sarah Helms,
and captain Anne Wiltshire.

That group hopes to return to
the ODAC championship, a place
they haven’t been since their ca-
reers at W & L began as fresh-

man.

A return to prominence means
stout defensive play, as has been
the norm all season.

Anchoring the back is sopho-
more goalkeeper Kiki Moreo,
who last year minded the net dur-
ing the then W&L record-setting
12-shutout season.

While on Saturday the team
proved it could win without blan-
keting their opponents, a 16th win
would suit the Generals’ fans just
ﬁne on Tuesday.

A close look at the Fall Classic

Andy, Neil discuss America is pasttime and make predictions about the World Series

Andy: Hi, hello, and welcome to
this week’s OutLoud. The world
of sports offers many possible
topics to talk about.

Unfortunately, many of the re-
cent events that would be worth
writing about are about lower-
ing our standards, lowering it to
the lowest common denominator,
rather then holding ourselves to
higher expectations.

Incidents such as the Miami
and Florida International ﬁght
two weekends ago are inexcus-
able and unacceptable, and that’s
all I am going to say about that.

The best spectacle in profes-
sional sports just got underway on
Saturday night: the World Series.

Baseball is described as Amer-
ica’s pastime, and rightfully so.

The World Series has been
held every year, with two excep-
tions (1904, 1994) since 1903.

Originally, it placed the team.

with the best record in the Ameri-
can League against the team with
the best record in the National
League.

In 1969, this changed with the
institution of the league cham-
pionship series, and once again

changed in 1995 with the institu-
tion of the wild card and the divi-
sional series.

Enough talk of the history for
now.

Some individuals believe that
the baseball season is too long
and too boring, which detracts
from the World Series.

I say that is absolutely ridicu-
lous.

Baseball and the World Series
are sports at its purest. A seven-
game series removes the potential
for a ﬂuke victory, as in the NCAA
College Basketball Tournament,
and does not hype one game at
a neutral site to decide the whole
outcome as in the Super Bowl.

Each game is equally as im-
portant, with both teams having
to play in hostile environments in
order to secure the crown.

What makes the World Series
even more interesting is the sto-
ries of how the teams got there.
The Tigers’ return to greatness
and the Cardinals’ second trip in
three years are just a few of the
stories lines that might be heard.

The St. Louis Cardinals make
their 17”‘ appearance in a World

Series while the Tigers make their
l0“‘.

I want to challenge all sports
fans to tune in and watch it. It
should be a great series, one of
the better ones in recent years.

In addition, this series features
two historic managers, an MVP
candidate, and a team that has
gone from worst to ﬁrst in a mat-
ter of a few years.

What to Watch this Week:

0 Generals Football at Bridgewa-
ter on Saturday at 1pm.

0 The World Series on FOX

Neil: A Cardinals-Tigers World
Series is just what the doctor or-
dered for baseball.

It gives people a chance to re-
member a time in baseball when
stars shone just a bit brighter and
all was just a bit better.

The Cardinals and Tigers met
in the 1968 Fall Classic and,
just like this year’s World Series
is bound to be, it was an instant

classic.

The Cardinals went into the se-
ries as the defending champions.
Game one pitted Bob Gibson, one
of the greatest pitchers of all time,
against Denny McLain, who won
31 games in 1968.

The spotlight would be stolen
from McLain. He beat Bob Gib-
son in the deciding game seven
and ended up with three com-
plete game victories and the MVP
award. His outstanding perfor-
mance in game seven brought
the Tigers back from a 3-1 series
deﬁcit and handed them their ﬁrst
title since 1945. '

Detroit next won in 1984 as
Allen Trammel led the Tigers to
an easy ﬁve-game win over San
Diego. Can the Tigers win in
2006?

All signs point to a Tigers vic-
tory, just three years after they
lost 119 games.

They are led by young, ener-
getic players. They can hit, they
can ﬁeld and, most importantly,
they can pitch.

Led by the Gambler, Kenny
Rogers, and Justin Verlander, the
Tigers’ pitching staff is the key to

the Tigers’ success.

Just as in 1968, no city de-
serves a World Series victory
more than Detroit. In 1967, De-
troit suffered through massive
riots that were only surpassed by
the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
The city was torn apart, but the
Tigers rallied the city and healed
a lot of wounds.

Detroit is faced with other
problems now. -

The American auto industry is ’

ﬂoundering and they are run by a
mayor, who is probably corrupt
and apparently throws some of
the best parties in the country.

All Detroit has going for it
these days is its sports. The Wol-
verines (University of Michigan)
lead the way, the Pistons are great,
the Red Wings are the reason De-
troit is called Hockey Town.

Even the WNBA’s Detroit
Shock is one of the best around.

Now, the Tigers are hopefully
going to rise back on top, which
is a spot they deserve to be.

Their Prediction:

THE RING-TUM PHI - 11

  Taking Frisbee

' to the next leve

Two Dead Guys going strong as they enter ﬁfth year

 

 

By catherlne Carlock
srArr wmrrn

The offense scores in the end
zone and receives points, and the
two competing teams peel off to
their respective ends of the ﬁeld.

Think you know what’s com-
ing next? A kickoff, right?

How about a throw-oﬂ‘?

That’s right, a throw-off.

To many, Frisbee is a recre-
ational sport that can be played in
the BDG quad or on the Colon-
nade. However, to a certain group
of students here on campus, Fris-
bee is more than just a leisure ac-
tivity used to pass the time.

Welcome to Two Dead Guys
(named after, ironically, Wash-
ington and Lee), one of the most
established club sports at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Ultimate is “a mix between
soccer and football,” said junior
President Adam Hoehn.

The premise is simple—get
the Frisbee into your team’s end
zone.

Players accomplish this by

passing the discs down the ﬁeld,

but there’s a catch: Once the play-
ers catch the Frisbee, they aren’t
allowed to move.

Ultimate is a club sport, which
leads to a “pretty positive atmo-
sphere,” said junior Annie Vlieg-
enthart.

“You get the opportunity to
play a pretty serious sport, but if
you don’t have time to come, they
don’t get mad,” Vliegenthart con-
tinued.

\

“The guys are really great. T hey just want

people to come and play with them. ”

AMY KARWAN, Two Dead Guys

Besides the “great team inter-
action,” according to Vliegent-
hart, Ultimate offers the opportu-
nity to make lasting friendships.

“My best friends are the peo-
ple on the team,” said alum Matt
Kianski, who helped found Two
Dead Guys with fellow alum Tim
Smith in 2002.

Kianski graduated last spring
and was in town for homecoming
weekend.

2006 marks Two Dead Guys’
ﬁfth anniversary, and Kianski
thinks “it’s impressive the team
has survived.”

Kianski and fellow alum Tim
Smith legitimized Ultimate as a
club sport in 2002.

Before that, they played pick-

.up with friends. In November
2002,.W&L hosted a.4-team tour;,..'

nament, with local teams JMU,
Radford, and Liberty.

Two months later, W&L at-
tended their “ﬁrst real tourna-
ment,” with around 16 teams, ac-
cording to Kianski.

W&L usually sends around 15
people to each tournament.

“Generally smaller col-
leges will play each other,” said
Hoehn.

Minks ﬁght
until the end

Rugby team hangs tough with
Division 1 opponents

By Joel Poelhuls
STA FF W RITE R

The Washington & Lee
Screaming Minks have made a
habit of playing teams that over-
match them in division, experi-
ence, and program size. From
teams in Argentina last spring to
the traditional Lee-Jackson game
against Division I VMI, the team
seems to be a glutton for punish-
ment as far as their competition
goes.

This tough schedule, however,
has enabled them to go undefeat-
ed in the conference and earn a
berth in the Ed Lee Invitational.
It should be no surprise, then, that
the Minks played up to the level
of visiting Divison I opponent
Virginia Tech on Saturday after-
noon.

The Minks scored ﬁrst, but
then Virginia Tech scored three
times in a row—twice in the ﬁrst
half and once in the second.

The Minks battled back from
the deﬁcit and scored within the
eight minute mark, but were un-
able to pull out the victory, losing
by three.

“It was a game we prob-
ably should have won,” freshman
Christian Remmel said. “We had
a three week layover from the last
game, including reading days and
midterms, and the intensity wasn’t
quite what it could have been the

whole game.”

The team is now back prac-
ticing hard for their last regu-
lar season game (away versus
Longwood on Oct. 28) before the
Ed Lee Invitational tournament
brings a close to the fall season.
Longwood is also undefeated in
the conference.

Captain Tino Tovo said the
team will stick to its game plan in
the post-season.

“We want to keep things sim-
ple and focus on the basics,” he
said.

With most of the season in
hindsight, Tovo was able to reﬂect
on the improvements the team has
made.

“Overall, not just this season
but the last three years we have
had a lot more consistency: 23
to 25 players who show up and
come to practice on a regilar ba-
sis,” Tovo said.

“We don’t have people who
don’t come to practice much and
then show up at games,” Tovo ex-
plained. “That makes a big dif-
ference.”

After the fall season draws to a
close, the Minks will take a break
until practices for the spring start
in February.

The spring season will begin
in March, and at its conclusion,
the team has tentative plans for
a rugby tour in Europe similar to
last year’s trip to Argentina.

Whoever wants to come is
welcome, and Two Dead Guys
are always looking for new mem-
bers.

Ultimate is a coed club sport,
Amy Karwan knows what it’s like
to be “the girl” on the team, even
though Ultimate is a coed sport.
She’s “played two tournaments as
the only girl.”

“The guys are really great,”
said Karwan. “They just want
people to come and play with
them.”

Two Dead Guys has already
played at a tournament in Gettys-
burg, Pennsylvania, and they will
head to a tournament in Guilford
later on in the year.

The team practices every

Tuesday and.Thursday on..the.law-. ~
school ﬁeldiand every Sunday in“;

the open area next to the soccer
ﬁeld.

Each’ practice generally lasts
an hour and a half and is evenly
divided between drills and scrim-
mages.

“Frisbee is the greatest sport in
the world,” said Kianski. Those
on the Two Dead Guys Ultimate
team tend to agree.

The stories you didn’t see

Lewis remembers athletes whose deaths didn ’t make headlines

ByAdam Lewls
COLUMNIST

Just last week, tragedy struck

in Manhattan as New York Yan- ,

kees pitcher Cory Lidle and
his ﬂight instructor crashed a
small plane into a New York
City building, leaving both men
dead.

As I
am sure
you all
have
heard or
read, Li-
dle was
known
for being
a great
man,
both in baseball and in his small
California community, and hear-
ing of his death brings sorrow to
the ears of every American.

However, not to take any-
thing away from this terrible
loss, I would, at this time, like to
take the opportunity to acknowl-
edge and honor the deaths of
several athletes.

These are athletes whom
you may not have heard of, who
passed away last week, and who
were as much a part of their
small communities as Lidle was.
However, they did not capture
headlines or cover stories on
newspapers.

Travis Davis. Travis was an
honor student, All-State wrestler,
and a football player at Harding
High School in North Carolina,
and was looking forward to at-
tending college in the fall.

 

Family and friends describe
Travis as a great kid with a re-
markable smile, one that will
never escape the minds of those
who knew him.

Tragically, on his way home
from a visit with his girlfriend,
Travis was shot and killed, for no
reason apparent to authorities.

Haris Charalambous. Haris
was a University of Toledo bas-
ketball player who was known
more as a person than an athlete.

Friends remember his unique
friendliness and personality, as
he seemed to always be in a good
mood.

Nonetheless, he died this past
week of a heart condition while
practicing with his team.

About 750 people attended his
memorial service, all of whom
regarded the service as a celebra-
tion of the life of this remarkable
student-athlete.

F errnin Vialpando. As a high
school football player in Colorado
Springs, Colo., Ferrnin was rec-
ognized as a well-liked kid, who
was extremely easy to talk to.

His family recalls his high
aspirations that extended beyond
the football ﬁeld.

Friends remark that Ferrnin
had an unmatchable attitude on
and off the ﬁeld, and coaches
wished they could have had an
entire team of people like him.

Yet, due to an unidentiﬁed
heart condition, Ferrnin collapsed
on the football ﬁeld and eventual-
ly passed away last week, deeply
affecting the lives of those who
knew him.

Jamie Bliss. A junior at

I would, at this time, like to take the opportu-
nity to acknowledge and honor the deaths of

several athletes whom you may not have heard

of yet who passed away last week.
 

Caldwell High School in New
Jersey, Jamie, like the previ-
ously-mentioned students, was
the type of kid parents, coaches,
and friends felt privileged to have
known.

Jamie was a football player,
and had just recently been award-
ed the “Hustler of the Week” for
being the hardest worker during
practice, something that was very
special to him.

However, to the devastation of
his community, Jamie randomly
collapsed on the ﬁeld last week,
and having showed no past signs
of heart problems, suffered car-
diac arrest.

Each of these student—athletes
was tragically taken from the
world this past week, and I hereby
dedicate this article to them, their
families, and their communities.

Each is a hero in his own way.
Corey Lidle was to the baseball
community, these young men
were for their respective schools
and towns. They will all be
missed.

And while I do apologize for
the sorrowful sentiment of this
article, I would just like to take
a moment now to reﬂect on a
personal hero of mine, who was

a student-athlete just like these
great young men, and whose death
brought grief to my community
nearly eleven months ago.

David Gibson. When you
think of someone with a personal-
ity, multiply that by about ten and
you will get David.

In about every memory I have
of him, there is a smile on his
face, and an amazing smile at
that, either from a joke he made,
from a humorous incident that
just occurred, or just simply just
because.

David was a tremendous
swimmer, and he planned to con-
tinue swimming in college.

However, because I never
swam, my memories of David
are on the soccer ﬁeld, where he
proudly boasted an extreme lack
of skill, but enjoyed it just the
same.

On Nov. 28 of last year, David
was killed in a car accident, just
seconds from his house, where
the next day his mother received
his acceptance letter to Albright
College, his number one choice.

On that day, my town of
Montville, N.J. lost a truly joyful
person, and he will be eternally
missed.

Homecoming heroes

Football team continues six—game winning streak by crushing Guilford ,,

By Brian Devine
STAFF warren

Coming into Saturday’s game
against Guilford, Washington and
Lee football players thought they
had a pretty important incentive

to win. It was, af-

SD ter all, the annual
W &L 34 homecoming game,

complete with the
Guilford 12

largest crowd of the
season, a host of
alumni returning to Wilson Field,
and the eyes of the university
upon them.

That was all before the Bridge-
water Eagles lost to Emory and
Henry, a result that was broadcast
over the stadium’s Public Address
system at halftime, with the Gen-
erals leading the Quakers 10-3.

After that, the necessity to win
on homecoming took a back seat
to the opportunity to get a leg
up on their primary competition
for the ODAC championship.
Bridgewater, the pre-season fa-
vorite to win the conference and

a team ranked 11”‘ in the nation at
one point, had now lost two con-
secutive conference games.

W&L, picked by most to be
the second-place team in the con-
ference, would have zero confer-
ence losses with only two ODAC
contests left in the season if they
could ﬁnish off the Quakers.

The Generals led with a de-
fense that pressured Guilford
quarterback Josh Vogelbach into
throwing three interceptions and
dozens of forced errant passes, as
well as sacking him three times;
Vogelbach threw for only 218
yards, his lowest total of the sea-
son, and he completed only 25 of
56 passes. Guilford’s offense had
more turnovers (three) than scores
(two). The secondary of Kyle
Luby, Jimmy Gift, Mark Snoddy
and Chris Prugar shut down the
Quakers’ receivers with an equal
blend of knockdowns and crush-
ing hits that caused receivers to
drop easily caught passes. Nearly
every pass play in the second half,
Vogelbach would set up to throw,

see all of his receivers covered
downﬁeld, be pressured out of the
pocket by a consistent pass rush
and force a throw into a covered
receiver to be knocked down. All
in all, it was a solid defensive ef-
fort.

While the Generals’ defense
was its usual menacing self, the
offense might have worried some
before’ the game. Running back
Stuart Sitterson, the workhorse of
the team’s rushing game, would
be limited to four carries by an
ankle injury. Instead, the work-
load fell to dependable fullback
Ty Parrino and do-everything se-
nior Colton Ward, who inspired
chants of “Colton for Heisman”
after a 79-yard touchdown recep-
tion in the fourth quarter.

Ward, officially listed as a
V-back in the Generals’ media

guide, was effective as a runner '

(28 yards), receiver (145 yards)
and return man (116 yards).
While Ward’s contribution was
invaluable, the fans will certainly

remember best a trick play run by,

Driven to succeed

Team stillperfeet in ODAC with win against Va. Wes

By Joel Poelhuis
smrr WRITER

Field hockey fell 3-0 to the vis-
iting Christopher Newport Cap-
tains Sunday, ending their seven —
game winning streak. Though the
team fell to 13-4 overall, they still
possess an undefeated 7-0 record
in the ODAC with the tournament
approaching.

Head Coach

Sn Wendy Orrison
W &L 0 said, “I thought we
showed some posi-

CNU 2 tive things [in re-
gard to the postsea-

son]. They were really fast

and they used it to capitalize off
some errors in our backﬁeld. . .It’s
nice to have a hard game like this
right at the end of the season to
prepare you for the tournament.”
CNU entered the game 9-3
and in need of a win for their own
tournament bid. The Captains are
ranked third in the region by the
NCAA, and are 16th in the nation
according to the coaches’ poll.
The Generals had also just
come off a comeback win against

Virginia Wesleyan on Saturday.
Down 1-0 with under three min-
utes to play, the Generals scored
two goals, ﬁrst from sophomore
Liz Garson and then from ju-
nior Kay Dyt to pull ahead and
save their undefeated status in

' the conference. Va. Wes. was the

only team last year to prevent the
Generals from going undefeated
in the conference. Last time the
Generals defeated Va. Wes, it was
2002.

Sunday’s game against CNU
was scheduled to be the last of the
regular season for the Generals,
but the game against Lynchburg
was delayed, setting up an inter-
esting scenario.

Lynchburg is the other team
in the ODAC with an undefeated
record. On Tuesday, the Generals
will travel to Lynchburg to play
for the top seed in the upcom-
ing ODAC tournament. Which-
ever team wins the top seed will
have home-ﬁeld advantage in the
semiﬁnals. This is critical since
Lynchburg plays on a grass ﬁeld
while the Generals play on turf.
The difference between these two

surfaces will play an appreciable
role for teams in the tournament.
The tournament begins Sat. Oct.
28.

In preparation for the tourna-
ment, Orrison says things have
been “business as usual.” Tra-
ditional end-of-season practices
including more playing time for
underclassmen or more condi-
tioning training are not out of the
ordinary.

“We’ve been in the top four

for the last four years,” Orrison _

explained. “The team expects to
be where we are and expects to
win. 1 think it’s a good thing to
get used to; it helps give everyone
conﬁdence.”

Playing the bench is one of
Orrison’s ways both of respond-
ing to the fast paced nature of the
game on turf, and of developing
younger players’ skills and conﬁ-
dence.

Throughout the regular season,
the Generals have managed to
post some impressive statistics.

They hope to convey this, suc-
cess in the post-season this up-
coming Saturday.

the Generals with 1:15 left in the
ﬁrst quarter. Three different play-
ers touched the ball in the back-
ﬁeld before freshman quarterback
R.J. Vamer threw a 29-yard pass
to Jack Martin to take the lead.
Vamer had another solid outing
(11 of 16 passing, 3 TD) after
taking over from regular starter
Hunter Dawkins (out for the sea-
son with a broken collarbone)
three weeks ago.

Martin was doub1e—covered
through most of the game but still
managed 71 yards receiving and
two touchdowns.

With the Generals ﬁring on all
cylinders, it is within their grasp
to win the conference. While
most in the stands did not realize
it, if the Generals beat Emory and
Henry on Parents’ Weekend, they
will clinch the ODAC title and a
berth in the Division III post-sea-
son.

Next week, the Generals will
play pre-season favorites Bridge-
water, who now need a small mir-
acle to win the conference.

Police say crime rates are dropping but
warn students to keep taking precautions

By Katherine Greene
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

t was a dark, still night, so still that the absence

of sound left a vacuum the wind kept trying to

ﬁll. The woman walking down the street didn’t
notice, and she shattered the silence with her too-thin,
too-high heels, clattering over the cobblestones in a
pattern of chaotic stumbling. She didn’t notice the
three men following her. In her drunken determination
to make it home, she didn’t notice much of anything.
The men moved quickly, slinking through the shad-
ows in a quiet conspiracy, coming closer to their prey

with each stealthy stride.

Lexington crime statistics:

Each year Lexington compiles its city-wide crime data and sends it to the
FBI. Here are the statistics for 2005.

The woman did not make it
home that night. She spent it in
jail.

A similar situation happened
in October--and it has the Lex-
ington Police Department wor-
ried that students are making
themselves too vulnerable to
criminals around town.

Ofﬁcer Ron Condry, who
came across the scene as it
played out one Saturday night,
arrested the woman and charged
her with underage possession
of alcohol and being drunk in
public.

She wished to remain anony-
mous until her case is heard in
court on Nov. 14.

Though the charges are seri-
ous and could result in the loss
of her license, they may have
saved her life.

The men following her, ac-
cording to police, were “just
local troublemakers, up to no
good.”

But Chief Steve Crowder
warned the members of Wash-
ington & Lee’s Inter-Fraterntiy
Council that unless students
avoid dangerous situations,
something awful is bound to
happen.

“You guys have got to be
careful,” Crowder said to the
men. v

He said that the women at
W&L are particularly vulnerable
because they feel safe enough to
walk home at night. even when
they are drunk.

“You’ve got to look out for
the girls,” Crowder said. “That’s
the way my momma raised
me.”

The woman’s arrest earlier
this month is not the only case
that has authorities on edge.

Michael Young, director

of public safety at W&L. said
that several women have been
“grabbed on the street,” but that
the incidents were never report-
ed.

Young sent out an e—mail to
W&L students on Oct. 27 wam-
ing them of “an increased pres-
ence of suspicious persons lurk-
ing on the streets.”

Since school began, a few lo-
cal residents have been arrested
and charged in incidents relat-
ing to W&L students.

One 25-year-old Lexington
man was arrested and charged
with peeping into the Massie
Street home of a student on
September 20. It was his third
offense, according to police.

One of the men following
the woman arrested by Condry
was later found by police offi-
cers. They picked him up a few
hours after the incident with the
student and arrested him. He
was charged with being drunk
in public.

But police say that students
are not always the victims.

Two men ran from the police
in two separate incidents during
Homecoming weekend. One is
a student at W&L, but the other
was an alumnus. According to
the police reports, both men
were intoxicated when they ran.

On Halloween, a man threat-
ened a police olﬁcer with a
meat cleaver in the kitchen at
the Palms.

Despite these incidents, the
crime rate in Lexington has
dropped over recent years. In
2005, the city only reported-219
crimes to the FBI, compared to
2004's 308 crimes.

Drivers for Traveller, Wash-
ington and Lee’s safe ride system,
reported multiple incidents of
abusive, inappropriate and vio-
lent behavior among students and
alumni over homecoming week-
end.

The incidents involved a
range of problems involving mul-
tiple drivers at different locations
on the Traveller circuit.

One Traveller Express driver
quit following Saturday night.
According to an e-mail sent from
Traveller advisor Ed Bulger to
Director of Public Safety Mike
Young, the driver seemed like she
“had just about had it.”

One incident Saturday night
involved a number of alumni who
refused to get off an overloaded
bus. ’

After the driver requested that
they leave, the alumni “got in her
face,” according to the incident
report.

The report said “they refused
to give their names,” and yelled
obscenities at the driver.

The driver turned off the en-
gine and exited the bus, at which
point “the alumni followed her

 

out of the bus as she walked
around it” and continued using
obscenities.

The alumni eventually got on
another bus that arrived at the
scene, leaving--according to re-
ports—the driver crying on the
sidewalk. The report noted that
“the undergrad students on the
bus apologized to [the driver] for
the behavior of the alumni.”

“It’s a sad day when under-
graduates have to apologize for
the behavior of alumni,” Bulger
said. ’ ‘

Another incident Saturday
night involved students at the
Davidson Park stop who “beat on
the side of the bus” and “threw
beer cans on the roof,” accord-
ing to the incident report. The
cans “rolled down over the wind-
shield,” forcing the driver to “tum
on the windshield wipers to clear
the windshield.”

In a separate incident from
Saturday night, a different driver
in the Red Square area had a beer
bottle “thrown at the bus she was
driving.”

The window was “fortunate-
ly. .. not open far enough” for the
bottle to hit her, although beer did
spill on the driver’s face, forcing
the bus to a brief halt.

In yet another incident Satur-
day, a driver was forced to request
security assistance after two stu-
dents got into an altercation on
the bus.

Before security arrived at the
bus, both of the students exited
the ‘vehicle. According to the in-
cident report, the students were
slapping each other.

These events prompted a
broadcast e-mail from Traveller
Chair Kaylee Hartung, co-signed
by Executive Committee Chair
Rob Rain and Student Judicial
Council Chair Matt Krieg, in
which Hartung labeled the behav-
ior “unacceptable.”

“If this kind of behavior con-
tinues, we risk losing our contract
with our carrier and the program
could be terminated,” Hartung
wrote.

In an interview, Hartung said
she was overwhelmed when she
received the incident reports.

“Traveller is not an entitle-
ment,” she said.

“There comes a point when al-
cohol is not an excuse. There is
no excuse for behavior like that.”

Hartung said that while she
understood the frustrations in-
volved in getting rides when the
buses are ﬁlled to capacity,

 takes a hit

Frat takes strike instead of turning in brothers

By Alden Wicker
STAFF WRITER

The Sigma Alpha Epsilon fra-
ternity showed where its loyal-
ties lie when it took a house-wide
strike instead of turning in several
brothers for marijuana use in the
beginning of October.

Just before 6 pm. on Sept. 27,
security ofﬁcer Daniel Rexrode
was doing his usual rounds be-
tween fraternity houses, according
to his report. As he walked toward
SAE, he noticed some brothers on
the third ﬂoor porch, if -

“Hey, guys, ‘security is com-
ing,” Rexrode heard someone
say. Interest piqued, he entered
the house and started walking

upstairs to the third ﬂoor. At that "

point, he reported that 15 to 20

people came “running”_down the .

stairs. That’s when Rexrode be-'
came suspicious.

Rexrode decided to investigate
further when he smelled what he
suspected was marijuana. He
talked to SAE President Jordan
Wesley but was unable to get a
satisfactory answer.

Wesley says that at that point,
Rexrode “put on his glasses and
looked around the computer
room.”

The security guard’s suspi-
cions (were conﬁrmed when he
saw a”few ﬂakes of marijuana on
the counter.

That was enough. Rexrode
wrote up a report charging SAE
with possession and use of mari-
juana, an offense punishable by
a strike from the Inter-Fratemity
Council.

Wesley talked to Campus
Security Director Mike Young,
IFC Senior Justice David Mitch-
ell, and Student Judicial Council
Chair Matt Krieg. “Everyone told
me that it wasn’t gonna be a prob-
lem,” Wesley said.

Wesley said he understood that
he would be allowed to handle the
matter internally.

“Part of the deal I struck was
that I would do an internal inves-
tigation,” said Wesley. “I asked
people involved to come forward.
I told them I wouldn’t release

their names.”

Several people came forward
to Wesley, expecting to receive a
punishment from just the frater-
nity.

“Then the IFC took charge,”
Wesley said.

The issue went to the IFC,
which gave the house a strike,
despite Wesley’s ﬁght to keep the
matter internal.

“I don’t [think it’s fair]” he
said. “I understand that they have
to follow policy, but the way that
it was handled, the information I
understood was that it wasn’t go-
ing to be a problem.”

What doesn’t bother Wesley is
the fact that the whole fraternity
had to take the fall for a few in-
dividuals.

“People did come forward
under the impression that their
names would be kept conﬁden-
tial.” Wesley said. “I gave them
my word. I decided that it was the
best thing to do. They trusted me
so I kept it secret.”

“The brothers look to me to
stick up for them,” he said.

SAE sophomore Reiss Eagan
echoed that opinion.

“I think the frat did the right
thing in stepping up,” Eagan said,
“because multiple people might
have been involved.”

As a result, SAE had two
weeks of social probation, lasting
from Oct. 3 to Oct. 20. They had
to postpone their annual toga par-
ty, along with other events, such
Thursday nights at Hooterville.

The house also had to pay a
$500 ﬁne and will have a strike
for a calendar year. Letters will
also be sent to the national head-
quarters and to their parents.

Now the SAE’s just seem ea-
ger to put the repercussions be-
hind them, and look forward to
the weeks ahead when they will
be able to party again.

“I’m glad it is ﬁnally over and
we can move on,” said Wesley.

It is not the punishment im-
posed by the IFC that really wor-
ries members, though.

It is their image they are con-
cerned with.

“It’s not good for our reputa-

as

tion, said Eagan. “It looks ir-
responsible. People might look
down on us.”

“It’s kind of embarrassing for
me,” Wesley said. “You’re doing
a good job, the fraternity is run-
ning smoothly and all the sudden
something like that happens and it
stains your reputation.”

Director of Student Activities
and Greek Life Jason Rodocker
said Wesley did a good job han-
dling the situation. Rodocker said
he was impressed with how Wes-
ley behaved.

“I think that Jordan Wesley

“The information I
understood was that

it wasn ’t going to be a

5

problem. ’

JORDAN WESLEY, SAE
Presldent _
 
and all the members of SAE did
a great job of meeting to discuss
the issue, of taking the issue se-
riously, accepting the decision of
the IFC and moving forward,” he
said. “They were very coopera-
tive.”

Rodocker points out that all
those steps are important in mak-
ing the process run smoothly.

Eagan was also happy with the
way his fraternity president acted
on the issue.

“He was very controlled about
the whole situation. He handled it
very well.”

One of the biggest issues for
SAE will be how the incident af-
fects fall rush.

“I think it has hurt rush,” Ea-
gan said, “because people might
look at us differently, with the
fact that we have a strike. Hope-
fully it will pan out.”

However, Wesley is more op-
timistic. “If anything, it’s helped
us, because we saved money. We
have some exciting weeks com-
ing up, with all the parties we will
be having.”

Traveller is still bound by
Virginia laws that prohibit over-
crowding.

“If it were up to me, I’d pack
them in there,” said Hartung.

In separate interviews, both
Hartung and Bulger raised the
possibility that Traveller might be

shut down if incidents like those]

on Homecoming weekend con-
tinue. _

“This program is at the mercy
of the students,” said Hartung.

She believes it would become
probable that the company who
runs the buses, A Goff Limos,
might not continue their char-
ter with Traveller if the situation
continues.

Bulger placed the responsi-
bility for change squarely on the
students.

“There are a few in the W&L
community who are ruining it for
everyone,” he said.

“[The problem] can only be
solved through peer pressure...
when students decided they want
this program and will stick up for
it and defend it,” Bulger said.

Otherwise, said Bulger, W&L’s
students could lose Traveller.

“That would be such a sad
day,” says Hartung. “I shudder to
think about it.”

Number of students recorded as
transported by Traveller:

strain as demand for rides increased this year. Dispatch

Campaigns call
for student help

While YD runs voter registration drives, other
students get ready for 2008 Mock Convention

Bywes O’Dell
STAFF WRITER

For some students, the
approaching November elec-
tions represent more than an
abstract political contest. For
those who donate their time
and talents toward their pre-
ferred candidate’s campaign,
it’s a labor of love.

For Senior David Mitchell,
“labor” is the operative word;
he spent the summer in a paid
position with the campaign of
Mike Beebe (D), Arkansas’s
current Attorney General and,
according to Mitchell, its next
governor. He has a knack for
picking winners: he previous-
ly worked on the campaigns
of victorious Sen. Mary Pryor
(D-AR) and Rep. Vic Snyder
(D-AR).

On the Beebe campaign
this summer, Mitchell’s re-
sponsibilities included orga-
nizing and recruiting volun-
teers to operate phone banks,
canvassing, and attending
campaign events. He also co-
ordinated the statewide yard
sign distribution plan.

“I knew that I wanted to be
involved in any capacity pos-
sible,” said Mitchell, an active
member and former president
of the Young Democrats.

The opportunity to get in-
volved attracts many students
to the College Republicans
and the Young Democrats;
both organizations campaign
actively throughout the year.
Current YD president Adam
Hockensmith points to voter
registration drives his group
has conducted this year with
Delta Sigma Theta, Alpha Phi

“YD has promoted phoning for Jim Webb
and has helped organize  a fundraiser for‘
Webb in late September ”

ADAM HOCKENSMITH, Presldent of Young Democrats

State Chairs are responsible
for a plethora of activities, in-
cluding fundraising and man-
aging research teams. They
will all “be very involved in
the politics of ’08,” said Lit-
tle.

Despite widespread inter-
est in Mock Con, veteran cam-
paigner Mitchell agrees that
many students miss out on the
regular political process

“So much is demanded of
W&L students both academi-
cally and socially,” he said. “I
would guess that [many stu-
dents] simply don’t feel like
they have enough time.”

But all the student politi-
cal organizations—College
Republicans, Young Demo-
crats, and Mock Con—have
big plans in the works to in-
crease participation. YD and
CR are planning for a debate
during the Mock Con Kickoﬂ‘
festivities, while Little and his
associates are working hard to
deliver another successful, ac-
curate, and memorable Mock
Con.

With elections looming
large in the minds of a few,
these student organizations
continue to work to expand
participation—and to ensure
the victory of the candidate of
their choice.

Alpha, and the Gay-Straight Al-
liance as particularly valuable
contributions to the campus.

Hockensmith says his orga-
nization has put a great deal of
effort into the Virginia senate
seat race.

“YD has promoted phoning
for Jim Webb and has helped
organize both a fundraiser for
Webb in late September and a
Students for Webb branch,” he
said.

Despite such efforts, Hock-
ensmith laments the lack of par-
ticipation in the process by the
majority of students.

“I would say that the students
here are very knowledgeable
about politics  Ijust wish that
this knowledge translated into
action more often,” he said. “I
believe that our campus could
be more politically involved, es-
pecially during election years--
and not just by participating in
Mock Convention.”

Mock Con remains the big-
gest political event on campus,
overshadowing even real-life
midterm elections of national
importance. The preparations
for the 2008 convention are al-
ready in full swing; Mock Con
Tri-Chair Wesley Little reports
that over 150 people attended
an information session for po-
tential State Chairs last week.

Doctor calls for action

W&L health center and local doctor worry about possible ﬂu pandemic

By Nlcole Mooradlan
surr WRITER

Local authorities have begun
talking about a new threat: pan-
demic ﬂu. Not a “regrlar” ﬂu
virus, experts say the pandemic
virus will form when a human
inﬂuenza virus combines with an
avian inﬂuenza virus.

In addition to their usual ﬂu
advice, some doctors are recom-
mending that, in case of a pan-
demic, everyone stock up on N95
standard surgical masks. These
masks can keep viral particles

.from entering someone’s mouth

or nose.

Dr. Fred F evrier is one of those
doctors.

He recently presented his pan-
demic ﬂu recommendations at
the Rockbridge County Library
as well as a Rockbridge County

i Board of Supervisors meeting.

“You ought to buy some N95
masks,” he told the Rockbridge
County Supervisors. “I recom-
mend it strongly.”

N95 masks are designed to
prevent viral particles from enter-
'ng a person’s respiratory system.
Since the size of the initial dose
of the virus 'deterrnines how sick
someone will get, Fevrier be-
lieves that wearing a mask will
lessen the severity of or prevent

    

I

      

     
   
  

   

the ﬂu.

“It’s the single most and only
technological advantage that we
have [to produce] some degree of
protection over what the people
in 1918 had,” he said, referring to
the 1918 inﬂuenza pandemic.

Still, the Center for Disease
Prevention and Control (CDC)
only recommends masks for those
who work in health-care settings.
F evrier disagrees.

“It is ill-advised of the CDC to
not have recommended the use of
the mask to the public,” he said.
“I would personally opt to wear a
mask.”

The Student Health Center
at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has begun to stock the masks.
According to Dr. Jane Horton,
health center employees have just
completed “ﬁt testing” for N95
masks.

Fit testing involves pumping a

foul tasting and smelling gas into
a hood the tester is wearing. First,
the person wears the hood with-
out the mask, before wearing the
hood with the mask. If the person
can smell or taste the gas while
wearing the mask, the mask does
not ﬁt.

“An N95 mask that doesn’t fit
is no more effective than a surgi-
cal mask,” Horton said.

She also does not see the need
for students to go out and buy
N95 masks. If absolutely neces-
sary, a regular surgical mask will
work.

“I don’t see [stockpiling N95
masks] as an effective use of re-
sources,” she said.

Fitting the entire campus with
N95 or surgical masks is not high
on the campus agenda. Instead of
worrying about a possible pan-
demic ﬂu, Horton thinks students
should focus on avoiding the sea-

how to protect yourself:
-Avoid close contact with people who are infected

- Get adequate rest
- Eat a healthy diet

-Always wash your hands

sonal flu.

“I would strongly encourage
anyone to get a ﬂu shot,” she said,
noting that ﬂu vaccinations have
already been proven to be effec-
tive. “Seasonal ﬂu will happen
this year, here.”

To prevent the seasonal ﬂu,
Horton encourages ill students to
practice “respiratory etiquette”
— covering a cough, staying more
than three feet away from other
people, and washing hands fre-
quently.

“If you could do only one
thing, hand hygiene would be the
most important,” she said.

Horton emphasized that stu-
dents should also take care of
their bodies by getting adequate
rest, eating a healthy diet, not
overdoing alcohol, and taking
multivitamins.

She also appeared to under-
stand the stress students are un-
der, and encouraged them to stay
healthy because “losing a week of
school can be deadly.”

The health center will receive
its next ﬂu shot shipment in the
middle of November, and notices
will be sent to the student body.

If students do not want to wait
until the health center vaccines
come in, Stonewall Jackson Hos-
pital will hold a drive-through ﬂu
clinic on Nov. 11.

Police gall for
more vigilance

crimes reported were
violent.

Still, police want citi-
zens to be aware.

Oﬂicer Nathan Kes-
terson said that the city
is lucky to have avoided
any major crimes in recent
years.

“It’s a double-edged
sword,” he said of the
numbers. “There are a lot
of things that happen that
aren’t reported,” he said.

Kesterson also said that
the low numbers might
lead to unsafe behaviors.

“People get a sense of
comfort,” he said.

Miller said that students
were not doing enough to
protect themselves.

“As vigilant as I’d
like to say you are, you
aren’t,” Miller said of the
students.

Miller said that the
students’ behavior would
eventually lead to disaster.
He said that students have

a “mentality that’s not go-
ing to change until some-
thing really bad happens.”

Young said that the hon-
or system keeps the crime
rate low, at least on cam-
pus.

He also said the close
environment of campus
should help promote safety,
but that it doesn’t always
work that way.

“We pretend to have a
family atmosphere here,”
he said, “but we need to
generally care more about
each other——it’s our jo .”

The small atmosphere
may give students a false
sense of safety.

Crowder said that de-
spite the lower crime rates,
citizens still need to be on
the lookout for danger.

“We can’t leave people
with the though that they
don’t have to still be cau-
tious,” Crowder said.

“Even though itfs a safe
community, we still have to

keep our guard up.”

Laundry code violations  

Basic laundry room rules: borrow detergent infrequently, try not to snzﬁ‘ everyone is rain-fresh dryer sheets

By Grace Andrews

c 0 L U M N I ST
oday’s topic is one of my
favorites: laundry room
etiquette.

Once again, I must place a
disclaimer here. What I am about

‘ to say may apply to you, but that

is not to offend anyone, solely to

3‘ enlighten.

Around two weeks ago, I was
in the laundry room located in
Gilliam when I was not only a
victim, but also a witness to bad

. laundry room etiquette.

To begin, my roommate and I

,' had loaded our laundry in an al-

most vacant laundry room. There
were a handful of open washing
machines, and since it was almost

I ll p.m., we weren’t too worried
about having any laundering
' problems. Boy, were we wrong!

After getting too involved in
an episode of “Veronica Mars,”

I my roomie and I returned to the

laundry room about twenty min-
utes after our clothes had ﬁnished

. washing. On our way there, we

both laughed at how funny it

it would be if someone had removed

our clothes to use our washers.
When we entered the laun-

' dry room, we were shocked (by

shocked, I mean a little upset in
our spirits) to ﬁnd that our clothes
were located outside of the safety
and warmth of a Washington and

the one next to it. Not only were
the clothes located on top of the
machine, but the machine was be-
ing used by someone else.

I couldn’t help but laugh dur-
ing that moment. I could not be-
lieve it. There, on top of the coun-
ter were my brightly polka-dotted
undergarments for all the world
to see.

No, seriously, my undergar-
ments were on top of my pile of
clothes.

To make matters worse, there
were two young men in there who
had the pleasure of watching me
try to conceal my intimates. To
make matters worse, the young
man who had hijacked our wash-
ers suddenly walked into the
laundry room.

I could not believe my eyes.
The washer-watcher walked in
whistling and shufﬂing his little
machine-stealing feet while I
gave him my ﬁre-starting glare
(which he did not notice).

The thought of this total
stranger taking my unmention-
ables out of the washer made me a
little uncomfortable. What he did
next truly disturbed me.

The dryer door-opener pro-
ceeded to open dryers that were
currently in use, for what reasons
I ’m not sure of, and close the doors
without restarting them. Then, he
removed clothes from a recently

ﬁnished dryer to use. When I say. .

This Bounce snzﬂer smelled the
sheets so hard, I thought they
might lose their freshness.

 

various dryer sheet brands sniff-
ing and “borrowing” sheets.

When I say sniﬁing, I mean
snifﬁng. This Bounce sniffer
smelled the sheets so hard; I
thought they might lose their
freshness.

Now, I’m not sure if this laun-
dry room renegade ever returned
any of these sheets or not, but I
thought it was a bit bold to be so
picky. I think the saying goes,
“beggars can’t be choosers.”

After undetectably observing
this clear and disturbing viola-
tion of laundry room etiquette, I
quickly set my cell phone alarm
for approximately one hour. I was
stricken with a fear of coming in
and ﬁnding my clothes placed
upon some unclean surface.

As I walked home, I wondered
if ‘ole Sir Snifﬁs-a-lot had “bor-
rowed” some detergent too, and
how picky he had been. You see.
common sense would tell you
that if you do decide to “borrow”

detergent from someone. you

too. It is one that I was a Victim
of so many times last year that I
went through a bottle of detergent
and Shout per month, even though
I only did about ﬁve loads in that
time period.

I quickly got hip to the jive
(yes, I just used that line, and no.
you’re not seeing things) and took
my washing aides to my room.

The irony of the situation was
that on my way home, I acciden-
tally took an unnamed bottle of
Shout that I thought was mine.
However, when I realized it
wasn’t mine, I screamed loudly (I
thought I had committed an acci-
dental honor code violation) and
ran back to the laundry room to
return it.

As much as I wanted to judge
the washer-watching Bounce
sniffer, I realized that I was just
as guilty as him of violating good
laundry room etiquette.

Last year, my roommate and
I “accidentally" took so many
socks that we could have socked

when I asked my roommate to
get my things out of the dryer for
me. She returned with about three
new t-shirts and some more socks
(surprise. surprise).

The problem in that situation
was that I didn’t fold my clothes
for several days, and it was right
before a break. Thus, when I no-
ticed strange un-Grace like items

‘in my basket, it was already too

late.

Even though I took the stuff
back. folded and fresh, and placed
them on a clean surface, no one
ever retrieved the items, and they
became property of the laundry
room.

I think that is why there are so
many clothing items on the ﬂoor
- people don’t know what’s theirs
and what is not. Out of fear of
committing an honor code viola-
tion. they just leave the stuff on
the ground or counter and walk
away.

Iloncstly though, who’s going
to pick up their underpants off of
:1 Iinty ground after several days?
TIiat‘s right, not me. Short of
the monifying idea of having to
do that in front of people I don’t
know. I bet the clothes aren’t as
clean anymore.

I‘m not saying that people
shouldn‘t take a washer or dryer
that they need or “borrow” deter-
gent and dryer sheets when they
an: running low. but there should

In my public laundering opin-
ion, I think that you should give
everyone thirty-minutes to come
and get their stuff. You never
know if the owner of the items
you want to remove is doing
something important, such as a
take home test or watching “Ve-
ronica Mars 

Nonetheless, I must say that I
hate when people just leave their
clothes in washers or dryers for
hours and never pick them up.
I know that I personally have
friends who will put their stuﬁ in
the dryer at some god-forsaken
hour (during the night that is) and
return the next day to pick them
up.
I don’t advise doing that, espe-
cially since if this method is ap-
plied to the washer, you may have
some strange bacterial culture
growing on your favorite t-shirt
and trying to befriend the lint on
your towel.

However, if you are in a hurry
and cannot wait, please be kind
enough to place the clothes on
a clean surface and conceal any
items that may be deemed em-
barrassing for others to see. Also,
don’t go around taking only the
rain-shower fresh dryer sheets
and leaving the tropical-mist ones
in the discarded scents pile. The
tropical-mist sheets have feelings
too.

Student apathy
on election day

Why college kids will stay home from the polls

America goes to the polls
Tuesday.

Students at Washington
and Lee will be doing lots of
things that day: sleeping off
hangovers, catching up on
homework, and spending time
with friends in the Co-op.

Most of them will not be
voting. And the vast major-
ity of other college students
around the county will do the
same thing.

This fact may disappoint
parents and the politics de-
partment.

But really, why should
Virginia college students care
about what Senate candidate
Jim Webb wrote 25 years
ago?

So he put some sex into his
novels. Sexually explicit pas-
sages in a novel probably are
not going to bother your typi-
cal W&L student. Sorry, we
just do not shock as easily as
the average 50-year-old voter
does.

Even if college students
cared about the issues, a vi-
cious year of mud-slinging in
-almost every close race has
completely obscured the true
nature of each candidate.

Few Virginia residents
know how the senate candi-

dates feel about expanding
I-81.

But almost everyone
knows by now that George
Allen called one of Webb's
staffers a “macaca.” Nearly
all the voters know that Webb
once argued that women
should not be allowed into the
Naval Academy.

These incidents — whether
recent or decades-old — might
tell voters something about the
character of each man. But do
they offer a compelling reason
for a Virginia college student
to head for the polls?

That does not mean there
are no issues of interest to
students. But since students
rarely vote, candidates see no
point in talking about these is-
sues.

Consider the rising cost of
college education. W&L stu-
dents may not have to worry
about this themselves, but
many of their parents certain-
ly do.

The federal government
provides Pell Grants to help
low-income students attend
colleges. In recent years
the government has chosen
to give _more grants but less
money per grant.

When is the last time Allen

and Webb — or any national
candidates for that matter
— took up the issue? Finan-
cial aid is something many
students and their parents care
about. But candidates from
both parties would rather
squabble over “values” issues
like abortion and gay mar-
riage.

Too bad a college educa-
tion is not considered valu-
able enough to talk about.

If students are not worried
about college prices, perhaps
the war in Iraq might concern
them.

Regardless of personal
opinions, every student should
realize that the new Congress
will shape America’s policy
on Iraq.

This is the last chance vot-
ers will have before 2008 to
decide how the United States
will light this war.

Want the United States to
keep troops in Iraq indeﬁnite-
ly? Or do you want American
troops to leave Iraq in the next
year? The new Congress will
be deciding that.

America goes to the polls
Tuesday. Even if we do not
go, perhaps we should know
what the voters are deciding
without us.

Traveller driver
abuse intolerable

Homecoming weekend harassment an isolated incident

By Abel S. Delgado
c o L u M N IST

Last Wednesday, I was the
quintessential Washington and
Lee student. I woke up early to
study. I went to class, read, read,
and read some more. After dinner
I went to a club meeting where
religion, philosophy, and social
life were openly and respectﬁxlly
discussed. I

Then I got on a bus ﬁlled with
fully inebriated people and partied
until it was no longer Wednesday.

They call it Traveller, and as
we might be reminded of soon,
it is a privilege, not a right. As
nearly everyone I know would ar-
gue, Traveller is an integral part
of campus life.

I’ll admit, being a student that
openly abstains from getting in-
toxicated and likes his parties
close to the dorm, I don’t use
Traveller much. But after hear-
ing what happened homecoming
weekend, my curiosity got the
best of me.

For those of you who haven’t
heard, during homecoming week-
end, numerous students and alurn—
ni harassed, verbally abused, and
even assaulted Traveller drivers
with beer cans. One driver quit
following an incident.

Frankly, this came to me as lit-
tle surprise. It’s always bothered
me that a community that can be
so gentlemanly and ladylike by
day could ﬂip the switch and by
night forget how to act with the
help of a few drinks, from a trash
can of course.

It’s something about this cam-

Those who act like jerks, whether
drunk or sober, should get the mes-
sage: we don ’t want you.

pus that everyone knows but no
one likes to talk about, or at least
not with authority ﬁgures. Stu-
dents get drunk on a regular basis
and many aren’t 21. No Alco-
ho1Edu or subsequent programs
have or will stop this.

But as I was reminded Wednes-
day night, homecoming was not
a case of students being drunk.
This was a case of students being
jerks.

“Even if I were plastered, like
I am right now,” one student said
on a bus ride, “I wouldn’t do that
s-. Whoever did that was an a- be-
fore he got drunk.”

On that bus ride I heard vari-
ous students talk about why R.L.
Stine was a better author than C.S.
Lewis, why raising cheetahs after
retirement would be fun, and why
the word hypothesis is so difficult
to pronounce.

On a second ride, my friend,
who was in a state our genera-
tion would call “tipsy,” and I dis-
cussed health care, education, and
the need for Traveller on every
campus.

On both these rides, every
single person getting off the bus
would ﬁrst say thank you to the
driver, whether they were drunk
or sober. Many others would make
conversations with the driver, and

still others would apologize for
the actions that were commit-
ted on homecoming weekend by
other students. Although I hadn’t
seen them drink, most of these
people seemed to be drunk. None
of them were jerks.

Traveller has become such an
important part of campus life that
we couldn’t stop talking about
what happened homecoming
weekend. People were upset and
with good reason.

And worse yet, they were wor-
ried what would happen if there
were no longer a Traveller bus
system. Campus life as we know
it would have to’ be changed dra-
matically. The party habits many
of us have would not be sustain-
able. I’m not even going to talk
about how many lives would be
put in dangerous situations on a
regular basis without Traveller.

I’m not going to condone or
condemn those who drink more
than they should. That’s their call,
and as long as they don’t hurt
anyone in the process, then I’ll
live and let live.

But those who act like jerks,
whether verbally or physically,
whether drunk or sober, should
get the message: we don’t want
you on our campus.

We want Traveller.

No excuse for Limbaugh

Medicated Fox not playing up Parkinson is shakes for stem cell research

By Cody Beauchamp
c o LU M N I sr

Rush ‘Limbaugh just might
be the most callous idiot alive. I
don’t care how conservative you
are. There’s absolutely no excuse
for his recent attacks on Michael
J. Fox.

In case you hadn’t heard, a
brief introduction:

Fox, who has had Parkinson’s
disease for 15 years now, recently
ﬁlmed a series of television ads
encouraging people to vote for
Clair McCaskill and Ben Cardin,
Democrats running for the Senate
in toss-up races in Missouri and
Maryland, respectively.

McCaskill and Cardin both
support stem cell research, while
their opponents, Jim Talent and
Michael Steele, don’t.

In the ads,‘Fox, shaking and
clearly having trouble control-
ling his movements, pleads that
people vote for McCaskill and
Cardin in the hopes that they
would use their offices to support
the research, which Fox said “of—
fers hope to millions of Ameri-
cans with diseases like diabetes,
Alzheimer ’s and Parkinson’s.”

Enter Rush Limbaugh, stage
(extreme political) right.

On the Oct. 23 broadcast of
his conservative radio talk show,
Limbaugh charged that Fox was
acting during the television spots.

“In this commercial, he is
exaggerating the effects of the
disease,” said Limbaugh. “He is
moving all around and shaking.
And it’s purely an act.... Either he
didn’t take his medication or he’s

As dying men and women, Parkin-
son ’s sufferers absolutely deserve to
hope and work for a cure.

 

acting, one of the two.”

Limbaugh even had the brass
ones to call Fox “shameless” for
doing the spots.

Limbaugh based a large part
of his charge that Fox purposely
wasn’t taking his medications on
what Fox actually did while tes-
tifying before a Senate subcom-
mittee examining Parkinson’s’
effects in 1998.

In his autobiography, Fox ex-
plained that the reason he chose
to testify without medication was
because “it seemed to me that this
occasion demanded that my testi-
mony about the effects of the dis-
ease... be seen as well as hear .”

Let’s get one thing straight-—
Michael J. Fox IS an actor. And
he has done some ﬁne acting be-
cause of his Parkinson’s.

But the acting I’m talking
about is the acting he did for years
to hide his disease, not to exag-
gerate it.

Anyone familiar with Fox’s
personal story knows that for
years he did everything in his
power to hide his disease from
the public.

From 1991 to 1998, Fox was
very much in the public eye
thanks to the success of his sit-
com “Spin City.”

. He gave what may be the
performance of a lifetime-—he
hid from the world that he has a
disease with symptoms that are
almost impossible to hide.

To Fox, the person he was in
public, the man who did not have
an incurable disease, was the act.

The man who could barely
control his movements, who
shook and bounced all over, was
the real person.

When Limbaugh attacked Fox
for “exaggerating the effects” of
Parkinson’s, he was confusing
something. Fox. wasn’t being an
actor.

He was being himself.

People afflicted with Parkin-
son’s really do behave like that,
even medicated.

I should know—for the last
5 years of his life, I watched my
grandfather die of Parkinson’s.

I watched him shake uncon-
trollably even with medication. I
watched him become bed-stricken
because of loss of muscle control.
I watched my mother tear up when
her father couldn’t even recognize
her because of the memory loss
that afflicts Parkinson’s sufferers
in the last stages of the disease. I
watched my grandmother cry at
his funeral.

As dying men and women,
Parkinson’s sufferers absolutely
deserve to hope and work for a
cure. '

That’s what Fox is doing by
promoting stem cell research and
those elected oﬂicials who also
support it.

Stem cell research is a contro-
versial issue for very good rea-
sons.

People have the right to decide
where they stand on the issue. But
before they decide to oppose it
on account of their morals, they
had damn well better look into
the eyes of someone dying from a
disease it can potentially cure.

If you can do that and still be
against stem cell research, ﬁne.

Even after watching my grand-

father die, I don’t support it. And ’

that’s a perfectly justiﬁable deci-
sion.

But to do what Limbaugh did
and accuse these dying people of
“acting” and playing up the real
effects of their diseases is not jus-
tiﬁable.

Even if they do go without
medication to show the full ef-
fects of their aﬂlictions (which
Fox says he didn’t do for the
political spots), they are still not
acting.

Even if you don’t agree with
them, people like Fox still de-
serve to be treated honestly. They
still deserve respect should they
decide to let the realities of their
diseases be seen.

Otherwise, you are being as ig-
norant and callous as Limbaugh.

And that's what’s really
shameless.

students offered their

, time and efforts to

the Rockbridge community for

festivities surrounding Hallow-

een. ,-

Last Saturday, students

showed up in large numbers last

Saturday to volunteer at the ﬁrst

Halloween carnival of the sea-
son.

Junior Kelly Boss said she
was glad she took advantage of
the opportunity.

“I especially had a great time
playing with the kids. It was
nice to see them having so much
fun.”

The carnival was held Satur-
day afternoon in the parking lot
of Wal—Mart. .

The store worked together
with the area’s Young Life
Group and W&L students Lau-
ren Travis and Justine Dargahi
to coordinate the event.

Wal—Mart donated the con-
cessions and Young Life pro-
vided all of the carnival equip-
ment.

In return, all the proceeds of
the carnival went to the Rock-
bridge Young Life ministry.

I Travis and Dargahi said they I

were pleased by the event’s
turnout. -

1 “I think everything went very
well,” they said. I am excited to
see that so many Greek organi-
zations showed up. I’d say that’s
success in itself.”

Each sorority and fraternity

was assigned a certain booth,
which they set up and managed
during the day. I

A variety of different games
and activities were provided
such as musical chairs, face
painting, putt-putt and pumpkin
painting.

Kappa Kappa Gamma Phi,-
lanthropy Chair Brooke Segod-
nia was in charge of the treasure
chest booth, which was a popu-
lar activity among the younger
children.

Segodnia spoke positive yv
. about the event.

“It was nice for once to fo-
cus on something besides scho
work and W&L social events. ’
she said. “I enjoyed doing sonic-
thing good for the community.”

W&L students were not thk
only ones enjoying themselves.
Eight-year—old Brianna Sears
was very enthusiastic about the
carnival.

“This year is deﬁnitely better
than last year,” Sears said. “My
favorite is the dunking booth. I
hit the mark three times because
I’m a girl, and girls rule.”

Last Saturday’s carnival was
followed by another on Monday
night at the Natural Bridge Ju-

venile Correction Center.

NBJCC is a more relaxed
prison for juveniles who have
proved themselves responsiblr
at other facilities. .

It has no walls and provid
education and discipline lessor
for its inmates.

V At the carnival, cadets were"

able to relax and enjoy the holi-
day by participating in activities

that are not usually allowed.

“It’s kind of like a reward for
good behavior,” said sophomore
Kelly Bundy.

“The guys work hard in their
classes and on jobs they are as-
signed, and this gives them a
chance to kind of unwind.”

Bundy thought the cadets
responded well to Volunteer of-
forts.

“It was awesome” said Bun-
dy. “All the cadets loved it.
They had a great time, and they
were very appreciative.” A

This event has inspired many
students to further their connec-
tion with NBJCC.

Students can volunteer dur-
ing the day at this facility as tu-
tors for the GED test.

“A lot of the volunteers want
to start tutoring there now be-
cause the carnival made them
realize what a great place it is,”
said Bundy.

The activities continued with
student participation at a Hal-
loween festival at Efﬁnger El-
ementary School.

Also-, students interacted
with young children in costume
as they trick-or-treated in Bak-
er—Davis-Gilliam Quad.

Volunteers also dedicated
their time at a Haunted House at
Rockbridge County library.

Boss said these activities
helped broaden her perspective
and reach out to community
members.

Boss said: “It’s nice to get
out of the W&L bubble and see
what else is happening in Lex-
ington.”

Arts expand to new hall

University dedicates Wilson Hall to former president, celebrates ﬁne arts education, excellence

By Dane Davls
surr WRITER

The brand new Wilson Hall
was oﬁicially dedicated to John
and Anne Wilson this Saturday.
The dedication ceremony cel-
ebrated the rich and long tradition
of musical excellence at Wash-
ington and Lee University. ‘

The night began with Philip
Norwood, Rector of the Board of
Trustees, welcoming the guests
and detailed all of the work, sup-
port, and time that went into the
construction of Wilson Hall.

Rector Norwood then pre-
sented President Ruscio with the
“key” to Wilson Hall, which was
an oversized swipe card.

After receiving the key to Wil-
son Hall, President Ruscio spoke
on the importance of music and
art to a liberal arts education. He
emphasized that despite W&L’s
small size, it has accomplished
great achievements in the ﬁeld of
music.

President Ruscio then intro-
duced John Wilson, the honoree
of the night. Mr. Wilson rhetori-
cally asked the audience: “What
is it, as alumni, that draws us back
to this place?”

Although regretting that there
were not one thousand vocalists
to sing Mahler’s eighth sympho-

any, Mr. Wilson was nevertheless
;impressed at the quality and skill
iof the University’s musical edu-

cation.

After a short introduction by
Professor Timothy Gaylord, the
night’s spectacular musical per-
formance began.

In addition to a piece writ-
ten by Professor Terry Vosbein
entitled “Music’s Empire,” two
other. musical selections were
performed as a tribute to Wilson’s
appreciation of Irish culture and
Gustav Mahler.

The University Chorus and
Chamber Singers sang the excit-
ing and vibrant “Music ’s Empire”
with music by Terry Vosbein and
text by Andrew Marvell.

The traditional Irish anthem,
“Danny Boy,” was conducted by
Gordon Spice and sung by The
University Chamber Singers. The
night concluded with the Finale
from Gustav Mahler’s “Sympho-
ny No. 2.”

It was a night of celebration,
because not only does Washing-
ton and Lee have a new hall, it
also has the talent to ﬁll the cor-
ridors of the hall with vibrance
and beauty.

A piano instrument major of
Washington and Lee’s music
program, Shu Gao, summarized
the excellence of the Fine Arts
department when she said, “I am
a music major because it is en-
joyable and fun. Plus, the music
major department is very small,
so [you] get personal attention
which is necessary to excel as a

musician.”

The idea for a new building
for the ﬁne arts department arose
shortly after the construction of
Lenfest Center. Dupont Hall, built
in 1953, could no longer ﬁll the
needs of the University’s growing
ﬁne arts department.

W&L reached out to its alumni
base for the development of a new
building, which together with
Lenfest would, house all of the
W&L’s ﬁne arts. The architecture
ﬁrm,’Zimmer, Gunsul, and Fras-
ca, and the construction company,
Brice Building Company of Bir-
mingham, both had alumni ties to
W&L.

As the building began to take
shape, unexpected budget costs
forced W&L to again turn to its
alumni base. The alumni, includ-
ing the Lenfest family, were more
than happy to give, under one
condition: the hall be named after
one of W&L’s most distinguished

presidents, John D. Wilson.

Wilson, who served as W&L’s
president from 1983 to 1995,
and his wife Anne Wilson, both
showed a love for music that con-
tinues to shape the University.

The completed hall now has
a state of the an auditorium with
excellent acoustics, studios and
classrooms. The roomy 65,000
square-foot building will give
current and future W&L students
the space they need to achieve
their artistic potential.

SA|Lfundraises
for Sudan crisis

Karaoke, talent Show fund relief eﬂorts for refugees

By Jessica Shaw
ARTS AND LIFE canon

Villages are bombed. Civil-
ians are killed. Women are raped.
Children are maimed.

These atrocious acts are oc-
curring daily in the Aﬁican nation
of Sudan. Hundreds of thousands
of Sudanese civilians have been
killed by an Arab militia in a com-
plex ethnic and religious power
struggle.

While the United Nations re-
fuses to deﬁne this as genocide,
the conﬂict persists. Several
Washington & Lee students have
made it their mission to make a
difference in this crisis.

The Student Association for
lntemational Learning (SAIL)
strives to introduce the student
body to cultural issues outside of
its boundaries. It also seeks to aid
others in times of natural disaster
or national turmoil, according to
lntemational Development and
Relief Group co-Chair sopho-
more Liza Njuguna.

Sophomores Grace Andrews
and Njuguna represent SAIL at
W&L. They have organized sev-
eral fundraisers to both contribute
funds to Sudan relief as well as
promote awareness of this crisis
around campus.

Money gained from these
fundraisers will be donated to
the CARE foundation, whichis
working out of Chad, a country
that borders Sudan.

Millions of refugees escaping
the genocide in Sudan have ﬂed
inside the Chadian borders and
are in dire need of aid. According
to Njuguna, CARE is trying to

promote sanitation, provide food,
and aid the refugees and citizens
of Sudan in any way it can. It has
been met with resistance from the
Sudanese government.

According to Andrews, Sudan
has become the main effort of
SAIL this year.

“I think Sudan is deﬁnitely go-
ing to become the focus of this
year because of the exposure it’s
getting at the moment and the rate
at which the conﬂict is intensify-
ing,” Andrews said.

Njuguna said that Sudan is im-
portant also because of the igno-
rance that surrounds it.

“I think we decided to focus
on Sudan because we are from
Africa and we think that it’s re-
ally sad that nobody really knows
what’s going on there,” she said.

This week in the Commons,
they have set up ﬁve jars with
professors’ names on them.

Students must place money in
the jar of the professor they would
like to see perform karaoke during
halﬂime of the Parent’s Weekend
football game.

By Friday, the faculty member
with the most money will sing on
Saturday. Andrews and Njuguna
are also accepting donations at
the football game.

Saturday Nov. 11, SAIL is
hosting a talent show at 8 p.m. in
the Marketplace from which pro-
ceeds are donated to Sudan relief.
The organization will be requir-
ing a three-dollar entry fee.

The show is currently com-
prised of 16-l8 acts of dancing,
singing, and other unique talents
performed by students and faculty
members. Andrews will be comi-

cally hosting the show.

Because this is its ﬁrst year,
Njuguna said that much of it is
an experiment. The organization
hopes to raise between 1,000 and
2,500 dollars.

Andrews said that either before
or immediately following the per-
formances, she is going to give a
brief presentation and summary of
the crisis occurring in Sudan, and
more speciﬁcally, Darfur.

She and Njuguna both said that
one of the goals of SAIL is to pro-
mote campusgawareness.

“We would like to decorate the
marketplace with pictures from
the conﬂict,” Andrews said.

“As the judges are tallying the
score, I will be giving some facts
and a brief background of what’s
going on in Sudan. ,

Everyone who attends the tal-
ent show will know why we care
so much and how they’re helping.
This way, we can make a differ-
ence and have fun at the same
time.”

Both students stressed that
the goal almost as important as
fundraising is increasing aware-
ness in the W&L community and
beyond.

Njuguna said: “If nothing else,
I hope people are aware of the situ-
ation, of what is going on and real-
ize that the majority of the people
who are affected by the situation
didn’t ask for this, don’t want this
and really feel completely power-
less over the situation.

We’re in a position where even
though we can’t physically help
the situation, we are able to sup-
port those persons or organiza-
tions that are there.”

4 Sophomores Julie Peterson and Matt Amling perform at the Student Showcase on Saturday at the Keller Theater.

Actors display talent

Students illustrate stage abilities in showcase via song, dance, drama

By Queenie Wong
smrr WRITER

The lights dimmed in the
Keller Theater Saturday night,
illuminating the talent of ﬁfteen
well-rehearsed acts of singing,
dancing and acting.

A wooden bench was centered
on the stage, as Master of Cer-
emonies Mark Heavens Tshuma
emerged from the darkness, puff-
ing smoke from his cigarette.
Tshuma calmly began his mono-
logue from Death of a Salesman
and was followed by ﬂashes of
red, black and neon lights. Danc-
ers emerged act by act, as the
third annual Student Showcase
progressed.

Audience members summed
up the showcase in one word:
“amazing.”

Senior Eka Akpakip, who at-
tended the showcase last year,
said that the “diversity and over-
all quality of the acts were better
[this year].” '

The showcase, which offered
free admission, attracted an au-
dience of all different ages. Fred
Massey, a local Lexington resi-
dent, said that he was very im-

pressed with the energy and talent
of the students.

“[The community] would like
to see a little more advanced no-
tice in The News-Gazette though,”
said Massey.

The showcase may have begun
with Tshuma’s monologue, but it
certainly wasn’t the last time the
audience would see this one man
showcased. Tshuma randomly
emerged time and time again in
various dance numbers, even per-
forming to his own version of bal-
let and belting Kelly Clarkson’s
“Since You’ve Been Gone.”

Tshuma’s comedy was well re-
ceived by the audience. .

The showcase displayed ev-
erything from Broadway musi-
cals and opera, to tap dancing.
Christine Lee’s tap dancing group
mesmerized the audience by us-
ing glow sticks to enhance their
performance. All the performers
were properly dressed in attire to
match their routine as the show
alternated between dancing, act-
ing and singing.

Every audience member
seemed to have their favorite act.
Junior Theresa Dougherty praised
Lauren Kampf, the co-director

of the event, who sang “The Life
of the Party” near the end of the
show, as her “personal hero.”

“Lauren deﬁnitely has a future
career in theatre,” she said.

In addition, Dougherty en-
joyed the break dancing routine,
preformed by freshman Rasaq
Lawal.

Akpakip called freshman So-
phie Xiong’s contemporary dance
routine to Panic at the Disco‘s
“Build God Then We’ll Talk” the
most original act of the show but
couldn’t pinpoint a favorite.

According to the Chairman of
the Theater Department Joseph
Martinez, the showcase was orig-
inally started by Technical Direc-
tor Tom Anderson, who wanted
to give students, especially fresh-
men, the opportunity to show the
directors and the student body
what they could do. A

Because the Lenfest Center,
usually showcases dancing, sing-
ing and acting separately, the
event, according to Martinez, was
a good way to combine all these
acts together. In its first year, said
Kampf, the event only showcased
talent by freshmen and sopho-
mores. The event later expanded

to all classes.

Performers were asked to au-
dition, said Co-Director Jenefer
Davies.

The auditions, however, were
inclusive, meaning that most
of the acts made it into the ac-
tual showcase. She said this year
their goal was to have an even
number of dancing, singing and
acting pieces.  f"  ‘_’

The performers, who usually
have prior experience in theater
or dance, went through two
weeks of rehearsal, Kampf said.
The ﬁrst week, they met with
their directors. The second week,
the performers worked on tech-
nical aspects of their routines.

Lenfest Center Director Rob
Mish also called the showcase
a great opportunity for students,
who don’t have time to partici-
pate in an actual play or dance
performance, to demonstrate
their talent. According to Mish,
the event, which attracted ap-
proximately 350 audience mem-
bers, had a better turnout than
previous years.

“This year it was clearly stu-
dents coming to see students,”
said Mish.

Annual acoustic extravaganza
helps support service opportunities

By Joel Poelhuls
STA FF w R I TE R

usical talent was
abundant at One
Acoustic Extrava-

ganza Sunday night, though
audience members were
somewhat scarce. The empty
seats in the Lenfest Center
didn’t seem to put a damper
on the performers or the re-

_sponsiveness of the crowd,

which applauded generously
and consistently.

Proceeds from the show
went to the Catholic Campus
Ministry for sponsoring stu-
dents on spring break service
projects and building a school
in Haiti.

There was a sense of ama-
teurism pervading much of
the show, which contributed
to rather than detracted from
its enjoyment. Organizers at-
tiibuted this to an emphasis
on more artists and an attempt
to tap local talent.

“We’re trying to get back
to the roots of the event being
acoustic... not having instru-
ments that need to be plugged
in,” commented CCM Trea-
surer Matt Harrison.

Harrison also explained
that while in the past, the
program has been called One
Acoustic Evening, it was
changed to ‘Extravaganza’
this year to reﬂect the greater
number of musicians and
styles involved.

“We tried to incorporate
as many people as possible,”
he said. “With more variety,
everyone can ﬁnd at least one
act that they really enjoyed.”

Stylistically, the show was
amazingly diverse, featur-
ing traditional acoustic gui-
tar acts, pianists, A Capella
groups and bluegrass bands.

The show could be divid-
ed into roughly three parts.
First were three solo acts,
opening with Ben Goldsmith,
followed by Bill McCorkle,
and then CJ Boyd.

Next came the A Capella
groups and bands. General
Admission started off the set
with a stunning rendition of
“Africa.”

Frank Lee III thenplayed
an original piano piece en-
titled “You Make Me Smile”
before going on to conduct
Joyful Noise in three A Ca-
pella numbers.

During “He Loves Me,”
members of the crowd (in-
cluding myself) clapped
along with the singers.

Jude 24 closed out the seg-
ment with their piano-backed
Christian rock.

After this, the tone shiﬁed
radically. There was a short

break as the drums and other
equipment used by previous
bands was cleared from the
stage to make room for Poi-
son Bottom Boys and Mon-
rovia, who wrapped up the
night.

These last two groups
displayed an amazing array
of string instruments, includ-
ing a mountain dulcimer (a
four stringed instrument laid
across the lap), a mandolin
and a dobro (which looks
like a guitar with a metal
dish in it and is played hori-
zontally).

The Poison Bottom Boys
introduced to the crowd the
bluegrass style, which Mon-
rovia continued in full swing.
Monrovia provided a great
ending to the night, closing
with “Wagon Wheel,”—led by
Burr Datz.

The evening was orga-
nized by Harrison, Mad-

eleine Gent and Josh Harvey
of the CCM.
Harrison covered the ‘

 for the show, Gent .

worked on promoting it and
Harvey (who also played
piano during Joyful Noise’s
segment) was in charge of
the musical logistics.

- The CCM is a national or-
ganization, but this section’s
advisor as well as much of
its funding come from St.
Patrick’s Catholic Church.

One Acoustic Extrava-
ganza is an annual event the
ministry holds to raise mon-
ey for service programs on
spring breaks and to build a
school in Haiti.

In the past two years,
students from Washington
& Lee and VMI have volun-
teered in West Virginia and
the Gulf Coast after Humi-
cane Katrina.

“We work in tandem
with...anyone who wants to
go for a great cause and give
up their breaks,” Harrison
said.

“With hands on activities
[such as constructing hous-
ing], you can see you made
a tangible difference in peo-
ple’s lives.”

Tickets for the event were
$10. Musicians registered
with the event for free, but
had to perform at a talent

tryout to ensure a standard of
quality.
“Initially I was ap-

proached by Matt Harrison
about doing a set. When I
heard Burr Datz and Josh
Harvey were involved, I was
like ‘this is going to be wick-
ed,”’ Boyd said. “I love to
perform. It’s what I do. And
it was for good cause, which
counts for something.”

Transylvania. Against Tran-
sylvania, sophomore Lindsey
Strachan won a pair of events
and swam on two winning
relay teams. She ﬁnished ﬁrst
in the 100 back and 200 back
and swam a leg on the win-
ning 200 medley and 200 free

Soccer team drops I -0 decision to Virginia Wesleyan, ODAC bid still possible

By Mike Huntress
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee wom-
en’s soccer team had its 18-game
unbeaten streak snapped yester-
day afternoon, losing a tough 1-0
battle against Virginia Wesleyan.

Their previous

s°°"° game this season
W&L 0 on Sept. 3 was one

of the two blemish-
Va- Wes' 2 es on the General’s

otherwise ﬂawless
regular season record.

Virginia Wesleyan scored on a
goal early in the ﬁrst half, which
proved to be the difference in this
battle of strong defenses.

In goal for the Generals, Kiki
Moreo made one save in the
game. W&L was held scoreless

on 10 shots on goal.

It was only the second goal
that the Generals had surrendered
all season long.

However, with their strong
record and national ranking, the
Generals still have a great shot
at securing an NCAA tournament
bid.

They are awaiting the an-
nouncement of the at-large bids
on Sunday afternoon, when they
will ﬁnd out if their season will
continue.

In the quarterﬁnals of the
ODAC championships, W&L
won 2-0 against Emory & Hemy,
which came as no surprise to any-
one who has been tracking their
progress, as win is pretty much all
they’ve done this season.

Through 18 games this season

the Generals remain undefeated
and still have only yielded one
goal

The two goals were scored by
sophomore Anne Van Devender,
whose second goal in the 56”‘
minute (she wasted no time with
the ﬁrst, scoring only ﬁve minutes
into the game) represented a mile-
stone.

It gave her 51 points on the
season (20 goals, 11 assists),
which ties the W&L single-sea-
son record for points, formerly
held exclusively by Karin Treese,
who pulled off the feat in 1997.

Van Devender’s accomplish-
ment just adds to the long list of
gaudy stats that the Generals have
posted this season.

The second goal spelled the
end for Emory and Henry, who

was unable to mount an attack all
game, recording exactly zero shots
at’W&L keeper, Kiki Moreo.

Her seventeenth clean sheet
of the season extended her own
W&L single-season record. The
stats jump out at any sports fan,
but watching the Generals play
on Saturday, it was obvious they
were in a different class than their
opponents.

There was visible frustration
on the face of E&H’s second half
keeper, Megan Smith, as the ball
was constantly on the E&H side
of the ﬁeld.

W&L’s formidable defense re-
peatedly beat back any offensive
attempts by the Wasp’s strikers.
W&L’s goalie, Moreo, seemed
almost bored at times.

This was one of the most re-

vealing examples of W&L’s pure
domination: the clear contrast be-
tween the cool and calm nature
of Moreo and the frazzled look
that characterized E&H’s goalies
(they pulled the starter after the
ﬁrst half), the second of which
seemed like she spent half her
time on the ground, diving after
W&L’s many shot attempts.

What was really remarkable
was that the score was as close as
it was.

The only previous meeting be-
tween the two teams resulted in a
7-0 win for W&L. The game on
Saturday could easily have had a
similar result.

All the Generals can do now
is wait until Sunday to ﬁnd out if
their season will continue on to
the NCAA tournament.

Six game Win streak snapped

Generals suffer tough lose to Bridgewater amid poor conditions and injuries

By Brian Devine
STAFF WRITER

Before Saturday’s game
against Bridgewater College,
the Washington and Lee football
team knew that a victory was not
essential to their goal of winning
the 2006 Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championship.

That fact did not lessen the
blow when the Generals fell 27-8
in Bridgewater, Virginia.

Handicapped by injuries and
weather, the Blue and White faced
an uphill battle against the ﬁve-
time reigning ODAC champions.

Jopson Field on the Bridgewa-
ter campus was muddy enough to
turn the Generals’ white road uni-
forms brown, and winds over the
stadium reached forty m.p.h.

The Generals’ running game
never materialized, as tailback
Jordan Campbell (10 net yards)
and wingback Colton Ward (20

yards rushing) struggled to gain
solid footing and ﬁnd open run-
ning lanes against a swarming
Eagles defense.

Already missing usual starter
Stuart Sitterson, the Generals
suffered another backﬁeld blow
when Ward left the game in the
third quarter due to a mild’concus-
sion. Both Sitterson and Ward are
questionable for next Saturday’s
game against Emory and Henry.

The Eagles, however, had no
such problems on the ground.
The hosts split rushing duties be-
tween 210-pound tailback Win-
ston Young (26 carries, 94 yards,
one touchdown) and his team-
mate Philip Carter (14 carries, 79
yards, one touchdown).

Coming into the game, Young
and Carter were ranked ﬁrst and
second in the conference in rush-
ing yards.

The Generals’ usually stingy
defense allowed 367 total yards

and were led by safety Kyle Luby,
credited with 16 total tackles,
though only seven of those were
solo.

It was an oft-repeated event on
Saturday to see Young or Carter
drive into a pile of linemen from
both teams, break several tackles
and rumble forward until three
or four W&L players could bring
him down.

While Carter and Young made
primarily downhill runs, running
parallel to the sideline, Ward and
Campbell’s runs were often de-
pendent on cutting from one side-
line to the other, a game plan that
was particularly ineffective under
such miserable conditions.

Freshman quarterback R.J.
Vamer emphasized the Eagles’
ﬁeld position when describing the
disparity in offensive statistics
between W&L (11 total rushing
yards) and Bridgewater (266).

“In the ﬁrst quarter,” said Var-

ner, “we had a couple of three-
and-outs, then we had the wind in
our faces when we punted away.”

Bridgewater’s average start in
the ﬁrst quarter was at the W&L
47-yard line. All three of the Ea-
gles’ offensive touchdowns came
before halﬂime, and all three
scoring drives came oﬁ” of W&L
punts into the strong gusts from
the west.

The Generals’ passing attack
fared only slightly better than
their ground game, achieving 137
yards. W&L’s usual game plan is
to run the ball in order to set up
the passing game.

Missing Sitterson and later
Ward, the visitors were unable
to do so, enabling the Eagles to
keep two defenders on wideout
Jack Martin nearly all game. De-
spite that, Martin excelled when
he was thrown to, catching three
passes for 85 yards and the Gen-
erals’ lone touchdown.

Martin’s 63-yard reception to
set up the touchdown electriﬁed
the dozens of brave souls who
traveled to Bridgewater to see the
game.

The W&L contingent, al-
though smaller than the home
crowd, was consistently more
vocal. W&L students are rarely
dedicated enough to attend road
games, and several players com-
mented on the loud support from
the visiting stands.

Though disappointed with
the loss, the traveling supporters
were able to walk away knowing

I that the W&L cross-country team

had won both men’s and women’s
ODAC titles- results that were an-
nounced over the Public Address
system at halftime.

The Generals need only beat
Emory and Henry at home on
Parents’ Weekend to win their
ﬁrst outright conference title
since 1981.

THE RING-TUM PHI 0 11

Breaking down
‘ the AP rankings

Lewis launches “Adam is Poll ” for college football

ByAdam Lewls
COLUMNIST

I hate to break it to all you Big
East fans, but the Big East sucks.
Well, to put it less bluntly, it is
overrated.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad
news, but your undefeated teams
of West Vir-
ginia, Louis-
ville, and Rut-
gers have been

playing high
school teams
that disguise

themselves as
Syracuse, Con-
necticut, Pitts-
burgh, and so on, and it would
simply be unfair to compare them
to schools in the SEC or Big Ten.
Again, I am so sorry.

Following the loss of South-
ern California to Oregon State,
West Virginia moved up to the #3
ranked team, Louisville to #5, and
Rutgers to #12.

With this said, there is a chance
that the winner of this week’s
West Virginia v. Louisville game
could potentially go on to the
National Championship (pend-
ing the ﬁnishes of Michigan and
Ohio State). Yes, it iss true. The
national championship!

Is thatiiilotiitypically reserved
for the two best teams in the
country? I thought so too.

I mean, just looking at sched-
ules, one can see that neither of
these possible national champi-
onship contenders (WVU or UL)
has played a ranked team yet, save
for Louisville’s match-up against
Miami.

Now don’t get me wrong, they
are still great teams, and there’s
no reason why they shouldn’t be
in the top ten, but when you com-
pare their competition with that of
every single SEC team, it almost
seems like a crime.

Let’s take LSU for example,

I would however; like to propose ‘Adam is Poll ’of

thetop 15 teams (the new AP), which barring any
diﬁiculties should be in effect nationally by 2007.

which is ranked #17, ﬁve behind
Rutgers.

Sure they may have two loss-
es, but at the time of each of these
losses, they played the #2 team in
the country, Auburn and Florida
respectively.

And while they were holding
Auburn to a single touchdown for
a hard-fought loss on the road,
Rutgers was allowing the same
amount to Ohio for an easy vic-
tory at home, (and just to clear
up any confusion, Ohio does not
have the word “State” following
it).

Furthermore, LSU still must
ﬁnish out its season with teams
like #8 Tennessee, #12 Arkan-
sas, and Alabama. Two of those
games take place on the road in
some of the toughest places to
play in the country. Rutgers, on
the other hand, does face West
Virginia and Louisville, but fortu-
nately enough, gets bye weeks in
between when they play Cincin-
nati and Syracuse. 2 

Now when I mention ‘LSU,
I’m not using them because they
are the only example of a team in
the SEC with a tough schedule.

In fact, if you look every other
team in that conference, you will
see that week in and week out,
they must go up against defenses
known for being extremely tough
and relentless. ‘

And in most cases, these
games occur within a week or two
of each other, leaving every team
worn out.

In addition, the Big Ten boasts
some of the country’s best offens-
es, including the #l and #2 teams,
Ohio State and Michigan. Teams

in the Big Ten can never afford to
take a week off, knowing that at
any given time, their conference
opponents, which include teams‘
like Penn State, Wisconsin, and
Iowa, can put up huge numbers.

I could go on forever, taking
every team in the SEC and Big
Ten and comparing their sched-
ules with those of the Big East.

And maybe it would be best
for the BCS if I did, because I
don’t know if they get it just yet.
But, seeing that I have probably
already angered more than a few
fans, I’ll save myself future as-
saults.

I would however, like to pro-
pose “Adam’s Poll” of the top 15
teams (the new AP), which, bar-
ring any diﬁiculties, should be in
effect nationally by 2007:

1. Ohio State

2. Michigan

3. Texas

4. Florida

5. Auburn

6. West Virginia
 Tennessee

8_. Southern California

9. Louisville

10. Notre Dame

1 l . Arkansas

12. California

13. Louisiana State

14. Oklahoma

15. Clemson

If you notice, Rutgers is no-
where to be found on this list, and
a lot more would have to happen
for West Virginia or Louisville
to reach the National Champion-
ship. But hey, I guess that’s never
out of the question when you play
teams who Washington and Lee
would beat!

Volleyball wins
63rd straight.
ODAC contest

By Lara Jordan
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and
Lee volleyball team won
their ﬁrst round match of
the ODAC championship
in convincing fashion over
8"‘-seeded Randolph-Macon
Women’s College 30-25, 30-
17, 30-15.

The team improved their
overall record to 25-7. The
win was the Generals’ 63“
consecutive conference vic-
tory, and as the toumament’s
number one seed, W&L is
in the driver’s seat as they
move into the conference
semiﬁnals.

The team has differ-
ent motives for the wanting
to win the championship.
Freshman Jess Bunnell sees
the win as a gift to the gradu-
ating seniors.

“Volleyball has been such
a strong program here for the
last few years, and I want to
keep that winning tradition
alive,” said Bunnell. “A team
should always been improv-
ing, and for the senior’s sake,
I would love to make it far-
ther I would love for us to
make it farther into NCAAS
than last year’s team.”

In the R-MWC game, the
Generals were led by sopho-
more outside hitter Laura
Maurer, who recorded 10
kills, 10 digs and three ser-
vice aces.

Freshman setter Kristi
Stevens racked up a team-
high 28 assists, while senior
libero Lauren Edmonson
added 20 digs.

Sophomore right side
Jessica Ulrich added an ad-

Utter domination

ditional nine kills, nine digs, four
service aces and two blocks.

Part of the reason for the girl’s
success is the uniﬁcation of the
team.

“We set a lot of goals at the be-
ginning of the season and keeping
our focus on the same goals uni-
ﬁes us,” said Megan Steinhardt.
“We know we can always count
on one another to help each other
out.”

With the win, the Generals are
in position for another ODAC
championship and bid to the
NCAA tournament.

Senior captain Ashley Hurt
added, “The win for the Gener-

Randolph Macon Women’s

to play some long rallies,
which is good preparation
for the games to come this
weekend.”

The Generals return to

they host ﬁfth-seeded Vir-
ginia Wesleyan at 11:00am.
The ﬁnal is scheduled to

Hockey blanks Roanoke

Field hockey team advances to ODAC semiﬁnals with 6-0 win

By Mlke Fahey
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee ﬁeld
hockey team cruised to a 6-0 vic-
tory over Roanoke in their quar-
terﬁnal ODAC game.

The Generals were led by
junior midﬁelder Kay Dyt who
notched a pair of goals, and fresh-
man forward Sallie Armstrong,
who added one goal and two as-
sists.

The Generals opened strong
when Armstrong scored the ﬁrst
goal of the game two minutes into
the ﬁrst half, off an assist from
junior midﬁelder Kendall Korte.
Dyt then scored her ﬁrst goal less

than four minutes later.

Sophomore forward Melissa
Dolan added the Generals third
goal of the game in the 28th min-
ute off of a pass from sophomore
forward Christina Merchant, to
take a dominating 3-0 lead into
the half.

Dyt added some insurance
shortly into the second half, when
she scored her second goal of the
game off of an assist from Ann-
strong. The Generals continued
their domination as freshman
midﬁelder Alex Caritis and senior
defender Kim Babbitt added goals
later in the second half.

Junior Tara Rubenstein and
freshman Caroline Habliston

shared the goal keeping duties for
W&L, combining to make four
saves.

Following the victory, Dolan
said, “Our victory against Roa-
noke was great since during the
regular season they took us to
overtime at their home ﬁeld. I
think we have come together as a
team since that game, and we are
deﬁnitely on right now.”

The Generals will face Eastern
Mennonite in the semiﬁnals of
the ODAC Tournament on Friday

in Lynchburg, Va. The Lynch- 1

burg home ﬁeld is new grass tuft,
which could pose a test to the
Generals.

Merchant added, “We will be

playing on Lynchburg’s new
grass turf, which could be a
challenge, since we have yet to
play on grass turf this season.”

However, as the Generals
ﬁnish out to ODAC champi-
onship they are posed to chal-
lenge any team that stands up
to them.

Dolan added, “The game
against EMU on Friday will be
tough; the last time we played
them we won because we were
so focused and psyched up. If
we win the ODAC, we have
a good chance of hosting the
ﬁrst round of NCAA’s, which
would give our seniors one last
game on our home turf.”

are crucial to race planning
and execution.“

Friski added, “We log hun-
dreds of miles to achieve the nec-
essary ﬁtness to bring back the
ODAC title to Washington and
Lee. Pure and simple, we run to
get fast. After the gun goes off, it
is you against every other runner.
The fastest person wins and the
best team of the day walks home
with the hardware.”

One of the keys to the Gener-
als success can be seen in their
coach, John Tucker. Tucker, a
W&L alum in his 18th year as
head coach, captured his sixth
career ODAC championshﬁp with
the Generals’ victory in Harrison-
burg.

“Coach Tucker is a remarkable
coach. He takes what we give him
in the form of summer training
and gets us to the place we need
to be at the end of the season. His
coaching is easily the key ingredi-

ent to our success,” Friski said.

Berry explained, “At the be-
ginning of the season, our head
coach, John Tucker, gave us some
very simple goals. As he put it,
‘Get in the best shape you can,
stay healthy, and run up to your
potential.’ Looking back on what
has been and continues to be a
very successful season, we have
accomplished each one of the
three goals coach set out for us
months ago.”

The Generals next return to

action on November 11, when
they travel to Atlanta, Ga., to
participate in the NCAA South/
Southeast Regional at Emory
University.

Brower concluded, “The sea-
son isn’t over yet. Our top 7 will
be racing at the NCAA South/
Southeast Regional Champion-
ship. We won’t be contending
for a team berth at Nationals this
year, but placing in the top 4 or
top 5 would be a great note on
which to end the season.”

time of 26:05.12 for the race,
the Generals’ average time was
better than any other team’s by
almost a minute. _

Sophomore Jackie Burns led
the way for the Generals, winning
the race in a time of 24:36.60.
Burns was named ODAC Runner
of the Year for the second straight
season. Freshman Kat Telfeyan
ﬁnished second overall with a
time of 25:17.20. Telfeyan was
awarded First Team All-ODAC
honors and was named the ODAC
Rookie of the Year.

Sophomore Becca Taylor
placed eighth overall with a time
of 26:38.70. Freshman Dorothy
Todd ﬁnished 10th other in a time
of 26:55.20, while senior captain
Jenny Ratzel crossed the ﬁnish
line in llth place with a time
of 26:57.90. The Generals also
had a strong showing from their
freshmen as Mary France Weath-
erly placed 13th in 27:07.10 and
Elizabeth Krausnick placed 14th
recording a time of 27:17.80.

When asked about the team’s
success throughout the course of
the season, captain Ratzel said,
“It was important that we re-
mained focused on our goal and
that we didn’t take for granted the
fact that we’d won the past two
years. The team has been really
disciplined this year.”

Taylor, Todd, Ratzel, Weath-

erly, and Krausnick all received
Second Team All-ODAC honors
following their ﬁnishes. Taylor
was also named as the ODAC
Women’s Cross Country Scholar-
Athlete of the Year.

With another excellent show-
ing at the ODAC championships,
the team showed their utter domi-
nation of the conference. How-
ever, it’s important to note that
while the Generals did have the
fastest runner to cross the ﬁn-
ish line, their championship was
team wide. They relied on a great
deal of depth and strength from
all of their runners in order to win
the championship.

Ratzel added, “I’m really
proud of the girls, everyone ran
really well. And it doesn’t matter
whether they were number one
or number 16, everyone has been
working since June to earn this.”

Fourth-year Head Coach Kris
Hoey was named the ODAC
Women’s Cross Country Coach
of the Year.

Ratzel points to the leadership
of Hoey as a key to the Generals’
success, adding, “She’s deﬁnitely
our number one fan and and a
great friend.”

The Generals next return to
action on November 11, when
they travel to Atlanta, Ga., to
participate in the NCAA South/
Southeast Regional at Emory
University.

Soccer advances to semis

Coach Rolf Piranian gets 25 0th victory as team captures 2-Oﬁrst round win

By Brian Devlne
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee
men’s soccer team moved into
the second round of the Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference tour-
nament Saturday, notching a 2-0
win against Eastern Mennonite
University and picking up the

250‘*‘ career win for

of a disappoint-
ing home loss against Lynchburg
earlier in the week. The Gener-
als came into the game ranked
22”“ in the nation, and the 2-0 loss
dropped theminto the third seed
for the ODAC tournament, behind
Lynchburg and Roanoke College.
W&L ﬁnished the regular season

with a record of 11-2-2, going 6-
2-1 in conference play.

Against the sixth-seeded Roy-
als of Eastern Mennonite, W&L
came out ﬁring early, picking
up both of their goals in the ﬁrst
half.

In the 21“ minute of regula-
tion, junior midﬁelder Josh Dodds
scored the opening goal of of a
rebound, and just 16 minutes later,

Drew Crowley was credited with
the assist on the second goal.

Credit for the victory must
also be given to the Generals’
defense, who allowed eight shots
and only one shot on goal, which
was easily turned away by junior
goalkeeper Ted Sheedy.

W&L had a total of 36 shots

and 13 shots on goal.

The shutout was Sheedy’s
eighth of the season, and low-
ered his goals against average to
0.45 on the year. W&L has only
allowed eight goals this season,
while scoring a total of 42.

Coming into the game, the
Generals were set on avenging
their loss earlier in the week,
looking toward the playoffs as a

as a ‘second season,”’ said fresh-
man midﬁelder Strock Moore.

“We believe that we’re a good
team that has the potential to do
well in the postseason.”

Besides providing a chance to
bounce back from a difﬁcult loss,
the win also marked a personal
milestone for head coach Rolf Pi-

ranian. The veteran coach gained
his 250“‘ career win on Saturday,
bringing his overall record with
W&L to 250-206-33 over a span
of 31 years.

During this tenure, Piranian
has been named ODAC Coach
of the Year seven times and led
the Generals to three conference

Playoff time for football

Despite Saturday ’s loss to Case Western Reserve, football

In the best Washington & Lee
football season since 1981, the
boys in blue have won a confer-
ence title.

The Generals football team
capitalized on their chance to win
the ODAC, beating Emory and
Henry 24-6 in front of a stand-
ing-room only Parents’ Weekend
crowd of 6275 at Wilson Field.

The championship carries with
it an automatic berth in the Divi-

ﬁrst appearance since 1951. The
blue-and-white are the number
eight seed in the East region and
will travel to Wilkes University

Traveller overwhelmed by riders

Students say they are frustrated by long lines for Traveller Express system and are turning insteaa’ to the dispatch drivers

By Cody Beauchamp
STAFF WRITER

Those involved in running
Traveller, Washington and Lee
University’s safe ride program,
are looking for answers to in-
creasing demand being put on the
program by students.

Increased ridership has left
Traveller Express, the shuttle bus
service that runs Wednesday, Fri-
day and Saturday nights, facing
long lines of students for which
they do not have room. Travel-
ler Dispatch, the student-run ear
and van service, has been under
increasing pressure to help carry
the rides the Express service can’t
handle.

“The Traveller committee is
aware of the frustration students

have,” said Kaylee Hartung. stu-
dent chair for Traveller. Hartung
said that the programs resources
are already being “pushed to the
limit” in an effort to accommodate
as many students as possible.

Still, students are ﬁnding it
difﬁcult to cope.

Overcrowding on the Traveller
Express system is ‘causing many
students to resort to either call-
ing Traveller Dispatch system or
walking even when drunk rather
than try to get on the buses on
busy party nights.

As one sophomore student,
who wished to remain anony-
mous so as not to be implicated
in underage drinking said. "'It’s
ridiculous how long you have to
wait sometimes."

Frustrations came to a head

“But just because most of us are drunk at the

time doesn ’t mean we ’re stupid. We knowfull

buses mean you won ’t be getting on for a while. 

ANONYMOUS STUDENT, Class of.2009
 

during Homecoming weekend
_when angry and drunk alumni at-
tacked several Express drivers.
Mila Sugovic, a dispatcher for
the Traveller Dispatch, said that a
good deal of calls from students
asking for a ride come as a re-
sult of the students thinking they

would not be able to be served by‘

the Express buses.
Sugovic said most students
who call do so either when a bus

that is full passes by or when they
notice a large crowd at the Ex-
press stops and don’t believe they
will be able to get on the next few
buses.

“We know that the drivers
really enforce the bus capacity
rules,” said the sophomore.

“But just because most of us
are drunk at the time doesn't mean
were stupid. We know full buses
mean you won’t be getting on for

a while,” said the sophomore.

She said her solution is usu-
ally to call Traveller Dispatch and
hope they can handle her.

Relying on the Dispatch when
Express buses are f11ll puts a strain
on the system.

During the month of October
alone, Dispatch reported trans-
porting l,454‘students.

Hartung said the Traveller
committee is aware that the ser-
vice is under pressure.

She said the program wants to
expand capacity by adding a third
car -- along with the accompany-
ing driver and gas money.

“I think it would be possible
for that to happen by next year,”
Hartung said.

She said that expanding Trav-
eller”s services “is a matter of dol-

lars."

“Right now we are doing ev-
erything in our power to save up
the funds to make that happen,”
said Ilartung.

Hartung also said that Travel-
ler coordinators and Goff Trans-
portation, the company chartered
to run the Express buses, are talk-
ing about the challenges currently
facing the sober ride system, es-
pecially the large buses.

Hartung said that ways to im-
prove service for the schools 300
law students is also a priority.

Traveller also wants to cut
wait times for the Express and
Dispatch sections of the organiza-
tion.

Hundreds of Jim Webb and George Allen signs line the sidewalk in front of Lexington’s only voting place. Webb defeated the incumbent Allen by about 9000 votes statewide.

Locals Vote in

large numbers

Residents in Lexington help Webb win a tight election, but
citizens in the county turn out to vote for Sen. George Allen

By Jacob Geiger and Dane
Davls
NEWS EDITOR AND STAFF WRITER

Voters turned out in large num-
bers Tuesday across Rockbridge
County, easily trouncing turnout
numbers from previous mid-terrn
elections.

A highly contested senatorial
election and a controversial mar-
riage amendment to the state con-
stitution drew the most interest.

“I am more interested this
year,” Lexington resident Nellie
Reynolds said. “It is much more
crowded. Last year I was just in
and out.”

Mary Tabbut also said the poll-
ing station was unusually busy.

“I always vote,” she said. “I
started with Roosevelt in the
1940s when I was living in Mas-
sachusetts.”

The amendment to deﬁne mar-
riage as a union between a man
and a woman passed easily. The
Senate race, however, was far
more competitive.

Incumbent George Allen ﬁnal-
ly conceded the race on Thursday
to challenger Jim Webb, a former
secretary of the Navy. Since he
was only trailing by 9128 votes
out of more than 2.3 million cast,
Allen could have demanded a
state-wide recount.

Voters in Lexington braved the
rain and long lines at the city’s
rescue squad building. Nearly 55
percent of the city’s registered
voters came to the polls. Two
in three of the voters supported
Webb and voted against the pro-
posed marriage amendment.

Voters in the county and Bue-
na Vista strongly supported Allen
and voted for the amendment.

At the Lexington polling sta-
tion, there was a steady stream of
voters throughout the day. Though
lines occasionally stretched out of
the room and into the hallway,
voting was moving smoothly and

quickly.

“I have been working about 15
years,” poll worker Pree Ray said,
“and this is by far the busiest [I
have seen]. It is bigger even than
2004.”

The 2004 presidential elec-
tion had a national voter turnout
of about 55 percent. In Lexington
and Rockbridge County, however,
nearly seven in ten voters went to
the polls.

Ray and fellow worker Lynda
Gordon said crowds have also
increased since the city switched
from two polling places down to
just one. The city’s current poll-
ing station has ﬁve electronic vot-
ing machines on hand.

During last fall’s govemor’s
election, slightly more than half
of the voters in Lexington and
Rockbridge County came to the
polls.

During that election, the city
voted heavily for Democrat Tim
Kaine, while the county narrow-
ly supported Republican Jerry
Kilgore.

Kaine defeated Kilgore by
more than 100,000 votes state-
wide. »

D.J. Nick, an election page,
said he and other seniors at Rock-
bridge County High School were
helping voters understand the ma-
chines, which were ﬁrst used in
the 2005 gubernatorial election.
Nick and the other election pages
are A.P. Government students at
Rockbridge County high school.

“We explain how to work the
ballots,” Nick said. “We have to
be pretty non-partisan. We can-
not explain the amendments — we
just hand out the pamphlet that
explains them.”

Poll worker Lenwood H.
Johnson said voting ran smoothly
throughout the day.

“We have been very busy, with
a good turnout today. It seems
similar to 2004. First thing this
morning was busy, but it has been

steady all day.”

This year’s turnout easily
eclipsed turnout from the 2002
elections, when Sen. John War-
ner was handily re—elected. That
year about 1.5 million voters ~
or 40 percent of those registered
— came to the polls.

The only recent elections to
beat this year were 2000 and
2004, both presidential elec-
tions. Voter turnout is tradition-
ally far stronger during those
years.

Webb’s victory marked a
stunning turnaround in a cam-
paign that three months ago
seemed to be ﬁnished.

Then on Aug. 11, 2006, Al-
len called one of Webb’s cam-
paign workers a “macaca.” In
some parts of Africa, the word is
a racial slur that means monkey.
Allen said he simply made the
word up and did not intend to
insult Webb’s staffer.

S.R. Sidarth, the man to
whom Allen was referring, is a
American citizen of Indian an-
cestry.

From that point forward, the
Allen campaign lost its momen-
tum and gradually sunk lower in
the polls. During the ﬁnal weeks
of the campaign, most polls said
the candidates were at a dead
heat.

When the national press was
not busy rehashing Allen’s com-
ments, it focused on each man’s
footwear.

Allen has long been known
for wearing cowboy boots.
Webb countered by wearing the
combat boots his son--a Marine-
-wore before going to Iraq.

Webb’s victory cemented
Democratic control of the Sen-
ate by a 51-49 margin. The up-
coming session will be the ﬁrst
time 1994 that Democrats have
controlled both chambers of
Congress.

NPR ethics man kicks off forum

Department of journalism brings in Jeﬂrey Dvorkin to kick oﬂ school is 42nd Institute of Ethics in

By Jacob Geiger
N EWS EDITOR

Former National Public Radio
ombudsman Jeffrey Dvorkin told
an audience of journalists on Fri-
day that their profession has work
to do if it wants to regain the trust
of Americans.

“Only by" being completely
honest with our audience will we
regain their trust,” Dvorkin said.

During his time as NPR’s om-
budsman, Dvorkin was respon-
sible for monitoring things like
accuracy and fairness in the com-
pany’s broadcasts. He had previ-
ously served as vice president of
NPR’s news division.

Dvorkin left NPR in June to
take a position as the executive
director for the Committee of
Concerned Journalists. In his ﬁ-
nal post as ombudsman, Dvorkin
said his job was to “mediate be-
tween listeners and journalists in
the interests of good journalism.”

When Dvorkin accepted NPR

President Kevin Klose’s offer to
become the organization’s ﬁrst
ombudsman, NPR became the
ﬁrst major broadcast news orga-
nization to hire someone in that
role. Many major newspapers
also employ ombudsmen.

When he created the ombuds-
man post in 2000, Klose — a for-
mer writer and editor at The Wash-
ington Post - said he had liked the
idea of an ombudsman when he
was working for the Post.

As ombudsman, Dvorkin re-
ceived calls, letters, and e-mails
from thousands of listeners each
week. He estimated on Friday
that during his six year term he
heard from more than 750,000
listeners.

Dvorkin, who was born in
Calgary, worked for the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation before
moving over to NPR.

Dvorkin discussed how jour-
nalism has changed during the
last century and how journalists
can cope with those changes.

We have at our disposal a vast array of facts...

but fewer journalists working in the newsrooms

to make sense of those facts.

JEFFERY DVORKIN, Former NPR Ombudsman

“When my grandfather was
living in Vienna between World
War I and World War II, he read
12 newspapers a clay,” Dvorkin
said. “In a city of about 3 mil-
lion people, there were 26 news-
papers.”

He also discussed the changing
trends in reporting. Whereas CBS
had 38 foreign correspondents in
the late l980s, Dvorkin said, to-
day they have only ﬁve. He wor-
ried that the repeated downsiz-
ing of most news organizations
makes it harder for journalists to
do thorough reporting.

“We have at our disposal a vast

the Express service has in-
creased its capacity by up-
grading from four buses that
carry 10-12 passengers to 3
buses that carry 10-12 and a
fourth that can carry 24-25
people.

Hartung hoped to have
two 24-25 passenger busses
by next year.

Sugovic had another idea,
saying that it would be nice
for the Dispatch service if
they could contact Express
drivers.

“Sometimes we don’t
know what’s going on,” said
Sugovic.

Another suggestion made
by both students and driv-
ers to address overcrowding
problems would be a change
in the way the Express buses
run.

Many students complain

Sober rides tough to ﬁnd

"All I want to do is go from the Pole
Houses to Windfall, but the bus would go
the entire route back through town. ”

ANONYMOUS FRESHAMN, Class of 2010

that on a night when parties
are only being held in one or
two areas, the buses still run
through their full circuit.
“All I want to do is go from
the Pole Houses to Windfall,
but the bus would go the en-
tire route back through town,”
said one freshman girl, who
declined to be named. She
did not want to publicly crit-
cize a program she otherwise
“loved and appreciated.”
Sugovic had a similar line
of thought, saying she be-

,.‘

lieved it would be more ef-
ﬁcient for Golf to take into
consideration where the big
parties are on a given night.

Sugovic said that way
crowds of students looking
to go to similar destinations
would not have to wait as
long.

Hartung said a variety of
changes are deﬁnitely being
considered.

Said Hartung, “the bottom
line is we want to get every-
one home.”

array of facts. . .but fewer journal-
ists working in the newsrooms to
make sense of those facts.”

He said journalists face sever-
al issues as they continue to move
forward. Some of those issues
focus on the reporting side of the
business, like determining how
reliable sources are and separat-
ing rumor from fact.

Dvorkin also said journalists
must decide how to handle allega-
tions from the public about bias.

He asked if journalists owed
allegiance to the public or to the
parent organizations that hire and
pay the reporters.

The former ombudsman also
spent some time discussing the
media’s coverage of terrorism and
the war in Iraq. He said that he
worries journalists will be labeled
unpatriotic when they choose to
air disturbing or graphic footage
from the war-zone.

As an example, he mentioned
footage of Iraqi insurgents that
CNN had obtained. The footage
shows insurgents sitting in a car,
waiting to shoot American sol-
diers. The video fades to black
when the insurgents open ﬁre, but
over the audio feed the men can
be heard praising Allah.

When CNN ran that footage,
Congressman Duncan Hunter, the
outgoing Chairman of the House

. Armed Services Committee, ac-

cused the network as serving as a
“publicist for the insurgents.”
Dvorkin said he thinks the
network was just showing Ameri-
cans the unvamished truth about
the war.
“Americans have a right to

know what the troops are endur-
ing in Iraq,” Dvorkin said. My
fear is that in the event of another
terrorist attack, the opinions of
[Hunter] would become [more
prominent].”

He said that journalists, like
most Americans, were shocked
by the events of Sept. I 1 and have
struggled since then to ﬁgure out
how they should cover the ongo-
ing wars.

“Frequently journalists were
asked by other journalists if they
were Americans ﬁrst or joumal-
ists ﬁrst,” Dvorkin said.

Dvorkin said journalists need-
ed to remember two important
things as their profession contin-
ued to move forward.

“We need to remind ourselves
and our audience that journal-
ism is not stenography, [and] we
need to tell our audiences how we
know what we know.”

Football looks
for playoff win

continued from page 1

the team from the quarter-
back position before a sickening
tackle against Randolph-Macon
on Sept. 30 left him with a broken
collarbone and a senior season cut
short.

With Dawkins graduating, the
reins of the program are squarely
in the hands of the freshman from
Birmingham.

Vamer will have the continued
help of Stuart Sitterson, a sopho-
more who returned from injury
against‘ Emory and Henry to run
for 98 yards and gain 44 yards on
returns after missing all of the
previous game against Bridgewa-
ter.

That game, where the Generals
also missed do-everything senior
Colton Ward, was the team’s only
conference loss. Ward and Sit-
terson have been essential to the
team’s success, not only against
Emory and Henry, but all season
long.

Vamer said the two are “not
also

only great players but 
great leaders.”

Sitterson’s statistics have been
indicative of his team’s achieve-

ments. In the Generals’ three
losses this season, Sitterson has
gained an average of 13 yards per
game. In their seven victories, he
rushed for 53 yards per game.

W&L’s game plan depends
on solid running from Sitterson
and Ward to set up receiver Jack
Martin, who has over 500 yards
receiving on the season, including
59 yards in the title-clinching vic-
tory over Emory and Henry.

Often lost in the shuﬁie among
such offensive talents as Martin
and Ward is the Generals’ stellar
defense, 20"‘ in the nation in points
allowed and the conference’s best
in turnover margin.

Generals comerback Mark
Snoddy has nine interceptions
on the season, one away from the
school record. The Generals were
the only ODAC team to shut down
Guilford’s top-ranked passing of-
fense and played well in the loss
to Case Western Reserve, where
17 of the Spartans’ 29 points were
scored directly off turnovers.

The Generals’ loss on Satur-
day, in a non-conference game
with no bearing on the postsea-
son, was due mainly to the play of
Case Western senior Brian Calde-

rone. He returned a fumble for a
touchdown, sacked ,Varner four
times, and converted two ﬁeld
goals.

Despite the loss to Case West-
ern, which players described as
“sloppy” and “miserable,” the
Generals are in the postseason for
the ﬁrst time since New Year’s
Day 1951, where W&L lost to
Wyoming in the Gator Bowl.
Conference championships did
not always carry an automatic
berth in the postseason. This sea-
son’s squad, a talented bunch but
a far cry from the legendary I950
outﬁt, learned their fate on Sun-
day afternoon, when the NCAA
revealed the Division III playoff
bracket.

e thankful for
your dining staff  

Picking up after students not responsibility of employees

By Grace Andrews
C 0 L U M N I ST

Today’s topic is one that is
near and dear to my heart: giving
thanks!

As we all prepare ourselves to
have a week of vacation in which
we do nothing but eat, I think we
should not forget what the holi-
day is about.

No, it’s not just about Granny’s
homemade dressing and gravy, or
rnom’s old family recipe for sweet
potato pie, and it’s not even about
that scrumptious (ﬁll in the blank)
turkey, ham, or random fowl that
you will have the pleasure of eat-
ing.

It’s about being thankful for
the small things in life that are
sometimes taken for granted.

In my opinion, lthink that the
security, maintenance and dining
services are some of the things we
never stop to be thankful for.

These wonderful people work
hard to make sure that the Com-
mons is safe, clean, and full of
food.

Now, I have always stated
that anyone who feeds me is my
friend and that goes for the staff
in D-hall and Cafe ’77.

I do not get to eat in D-hall
as often as would like, but I had
the rare pleasure of eating there
four or ﬁve times in the past two
weeks.

Each time I ate there, I was
disgusted.

No, it was not the food. It was
the people, or more importantly
what the people did after eating

Win not exactly success

Allen is moral inadequacy led to his fall, and Webb Should never forget it

By Dylan Merrlll
c o LU M N I sr

Virginia is proof that democ-
racy still exists in America.

Here’s why:

Most of us paid attention to the
U.S. Senate race between incum-
bent Republican George Allen
and his “capital-D” Democratic
challenger Jim Webb, or at least
know of its existence.

These guys have been the sub-
ject of a media blitz, in which ev-
ery aspect of their campaigns has
been inspected and probed.

If you’ve watched CNN in the
past weeks, you couldn’t have
missed Allen’s faded glory pig-

' skin passes and the ubiquitous

“I’m Jim Webb, and I wear army
boots” segment.

A few months ago, most Belt-
way pundits had chalked up Sen.
Allen as the winner, giving Jim
Webb only a nominal chance for
the upset.

Allen’s famous football coach
dad and native son persona have
helped him ﬁnd notoriety and
popularity within Virginia poli-
tics.

In fact, many Democrats ex-
pressed disapproval when Senator
Chuck Schumer (D—NY) of New
York authorized party assistance
for Webb’s campaign against the
popular congressman and ex-gov-
emor.

Some racially question-
able comments made by Allen,
though, proved to be the end of

The people who work in D-hall are
not paid to put away your dishes for
you. It is not in their job description.

the food.

To my horror, people left their
dirty plates, cups, and utensils on
the table!

. I was shocked and repulsed to
see that it was not just one person
at a table committing this D-hall
offense. There were many plates
at multiple tables.

Now, why in grilled burgers
and turkey wraps would someone
leave their trash for someone else
to clean up?

The men and women who
work in D-hall are not paid to put
your dishes away for you.

Frankly, it ’s not in their job de-
scriptions.

When is the last time that you
gladly cleaned up after hundreds
of college students?

No, seriously, put yourself in
the well-pressed blue shirts of
dining service and imagine how it
would feel if every day you had
the pleasure of putting away nap-

kins and dishes and then wiping

down the tables.

I mean, who does not love ex-
tra work that is entirely unneces-
sary?

I know I do! (sarcasm intend-
ed)

Nevertheless, for a campus
that prides ourselves on respect,

integrity, and all those other great
attributes that build a strong char-
acter, we are not practicing what
we preach.

I was not supposed to write an

' article this week, but in the spirit

of giving thanks, I wanted to
thank some people on campus.

As I stated before, the dining
and cleaning services staff are my
friends.

I am ﬁercely loyal to those
who I give such a title, enough so
that I must speak out against such
atrocious displays of good man-
ners.

As Thanksgiving approaches,
I implore you to be thankful for
the people who work so hard for
us with little recognition and ap-
preciation.

Let us do this by cleaning up
after ourselves and making their
jobs a little easier.

The moral of the story is: clean
up after yourself, do not leave
your mess for others, and do not
let me catch you doing so.

I would hate to write another
article and have to name a few
perpetrators of crimes against
cleanliness, e-mail addresses in-
cluded!

Have a great break, and bon
appetit!

Some say that their vote doesnt
matter; what is one person 3 vote

amongst many?

 

his campaign. Apparently, he was
unaware that calling a young man
of Indian descent “Macaca” was
an insult.

The ever-attentive media
caught Allen’s mistake and turned
into a full-scale scandal. I wonder
if Sen. Allen’s father was watch-
ing as his son’s fumble cost his
party the game.

The expressions on the Repub-

licans’ faces were grim as they

lowered their Gatorade cooler and
walked away from the sideline.

But then again, the fact that
Macaca-gate occurred in the ﬁrst
place is not that surprising.

Washington insiders are no-
toriously bad at grasping simple
moral values (see Mark Foley’s
naptime niceness and William
.Iefferson’s frozen assets).

I’m not insinuating that
George Allen is a pedophile or a
crook, only that it is appropriate
that a notoriously narrow-minded
congressman was ousted because
of his poorly veiled bigotry.

Some might say that the close-
ness of the Virginia Senate race
shows the unfairness of our elec-
toral process.

How is it reasonable to be-
lieve that the smear tactics of an
overblown political scandal justly
determines the outcome of an im-
portant election?

That’s a fair point, but you
must still understand that the
loss was ultimately instigated by
George Allen’s mistakes.

If more people thought that
Allen was still the best candidate,
then he obviously would have
won. Many people had strong
convictions and were concerned
with the issues at stake, but they
still did not vote.

Some say that their vote
doesn’t matter; what’s one per-
son’s vote amongst many?

The journalist Hunter S.
Thompson struggled to deal
with this feeling of voter apathy.
Thompson, however, realized the
danger of such disillusionment.
“No one is stealing our free-
doms,” he noted, “we’re dealing
them away.”

Still, to some, the threat of los-
ing liberty is less pressing than
their lack of motivation. The
uselessness of adding one vote to
millions others, to them is an ex-

 

editorial

  Elect me baby,

one more time

The never-ending election cycle has got to stop

Election day is almost
here, again.

Six days after wrapping
up another nasty year of po-
litical mudslinging, everyone
in Washington D.C. is talking
about elections again.

This time, the subject is
2008. Even though that elec-
tion is one year and 51 weeks
away, Wisconsin Sen. Russ
Feingold announced yester-
day that he would not seek
the Democratic presidential
nomination.

Hmm. Let’s take a count.
Two years from now, who
will care who said they might
run?

This week, both politicians
and pundits are taking stock
of the new Democratic major-
ity in both chambers of Con-
gress. Why bother? All 435
representatives and 33 sena-
tors are getting ready for the
2008 elections.

Democrats liked to com-
plain that the old Republican
controlled Congress was a
“do-nothing Congress.” But
we would be shocked if the
new party in power suddenly
becomes a beacon of effi-
ciency.

Let’s face it. When Con-
gress opens its 110*” Session

in January, it will be business
as usual.

Politicians from both par-
ties will get up and make
pompous, posturing speeches
that rip into their opponents.
Then those supposed oppo-
nents will turn around and
help each other secure ear-
marks for their home states
and districts.

Even when the two parties
cannot ﬁnd a consensus on is-
sues like Iraq, immigration, or
the Patriot Act, they all man-
age to agree on the spending
bills. Pork barrel projects, it
seems, are the last bastion of
bipaitisanship.

And even when the Sen-
ate can tear its attention away
from sending record windfalls
back to their home states, they
will have plenty of campaign-
ing to worry about.

The following Senators
have either already announced
they will run for President in
2008 or are thinking about
running: John McCain, John
Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Barack
Obama, Evan Bayh, Chris-
topher Dodd, Joe Biden, and
Sam Brownback.

That means eight Sena-
tors are going to be focusing
on the Presidency instead of

listening to their constituents.
Those Senators come from
both parties, so both Repub-
licans and Democrats are put-
ting their own interests ahead
of the people they were elect-
ed to serve.

Several governors and a
few representatives may also
jump into the campaign. You
can bet on each of them ignor-
ing their constituents to focus
on campaigning.

Heck, some of those peo-
ple have been thinking about
the Presidential election since
the ﬁnal tallies from the 2004
race were announced.

Since political analysts are
estimating that serious candi-
dates will need an initial bank
account of $60 million to
mount a serious primary cam-
paign, most of these potential
candidates have already be-
gun raising money.

And since you cannot raise
$60 million overnight, those
candidates will be focusing
on fundraising instead of leg-
islating.

Maybe the new Congress
will surprise us. Maybe some-
thing will actually get done
during the next two years.

We’ll believe it, when we
see it.

ercise in futility.

But that’s the exhilarating

thing about voting. My vote was
one of more than 2 million, but
Jim Webb’s margin of victory was
about 7,000 votes, roughly equiv-
alent to the number of people at a
poorly attended rodeo.

Not only did my vote con-
tribute to the narrow success of
Virginia’s next senator, but it
also tipped the scales of majority
power in the Senate towards the
Democrats.

With a 15-minute trip to the
voting center on a rainy Tuesday,
I and millions of others earned the
right to criticize our government
and fulﬁlled our duty to partici-
pate in the operation of our gov-
emment.

The people of Virginia decided
that George Allen no longer rep-
resents their interests.

In an election whose outcome
could hardly be closer, Jim Webb
can’t assume that he has won a
treasure chest of political capital.

Politicians tend to translate
victory at the polls into a certiﬁ-
cate of divine right.

However, electoral success is
not a permission slip that allows
congressmen to graﬂiti the halls
of Congress.

Politicians should always con-
sider themselves the lesser of two
evils.

If they can’t, they will even-
tually become the greater of two
evils, and they will be voted out.

That’s democracy.

Opportunities overseas

International education drawing large crowds-, oﬂering numerous expeditions abroad during six-week Spring term

By Sarah Klentz
STAFF WRITER

Spring term is often coveted
by Washington and Lee students
as a time to relax outside, enjoy
warm Lexington weather and
ﬂoat down the Maury River while
still taking classes.

However, many students are
taking advantage of W&L’s wide
range of Spring term abroad op-
portunities.

This spring, students will
travel to a wide variety of loca-

tions, including Italy, China, New
Zealand, India and Brazil. In ad-
dition, a range of departments are
giving students the opportimity to
study a range of subjects such as
art, language, politics, business
and science overseas.

English professor Marc Con-
ner is leading a trip to Ireland for
the fourth time this spring.

He said one concern that stu-
dents have with traveling during
Spring term is that six weeks is
not be enough time to fully im-
merse oneself in the culture.

“[The program] is so intensive;
students will be in the ﬁeld 50-60
hours a week,” Conner said.

“It really is an immersion into
the culture. Spending more time
doesn’t always mean having a
better experience.”

Conner said another advantage
of going abroad during Spring
term is the ability to use the W&L
professors’ knowledge to the full-
est.

“For six weeks students are
traveling with an absolute expert
in the ﬁeld,” Conner said.

“They’re not in a tour group
setting. They’re with an academic
guide who knows the students and
the university. Other programs
can’t match that.”

Sophomore Galina Yudovich
will be traveling with Conner and
19 other students to Ireland this
spring. She said the program will
give her a new prospective on lit-
erature.

“It’s a way for students to study
literature where it was originally
written,” Yudovich said.

“We can understand the physi-
cal and cultural surroundings the
author saw and experienced.”

Yudovich said it is especially
important for W&L students to
experience the world beyond
Lexington.

“A lot of students here are from
an environment a lot like W&L,
and a lot are going into business
or economics,” Yudovich said.

“Going abroad and seeing how

 
 

other people live culturally and
economically will broaden their
understanding of the concepts
they’re learning here.”

Journalism professor Pam Lu-
ecke is leading students to China
with business professor Kip
Pirkle.

Luecke spoke of the impor-
tance of taking journalism and
business students to China. '

“We’re convinced that Chi-
na will be such a force in these
students’ lives and careers that
they’ll need to see it ﬁrst hand,”
Luecke said.

“It seemed like a logical de-
cision to show students China’s
business and economic growth
and how the news media is cover-
ing it.”

Luecke said an experience
in China will broaden students’
views of international relations.

“Students will be working
and living in a truly international
community,” Luecke said.

“Until you look outside our
country, you can’t understand
how we’re viewed by the rest
of the world. This trip could be
life-changing and open their eyes
to careers in other parts of the
world.”

Sophomore Emily Deddens
will be traveling to Italy with the
art department.

She said she is excited about
traveling with other students.

“I’d been to Italy before with
my family, and I loved the art-

“I wanted the experience of
traveling throughout the country
with my peers.”

Deddens said W&L should
take advantage of abroad pro-
grams in order to “experience
something outside of our campus
bubble.”

“We’re not in an urban area, so
we don’t get to experience a lot
outside our campus community,”
Deddens said.

Another new trip this spring is
to the American West to study the
Lakota Sioux American Indian
tribe.

The trip will be led by religion
professor Harvey Markowitz,
who said the trip will be a unique
opportunity to study the religion,
culture and history of these Na-
tive Americans.

“Indians are so far back in the
consciousness "of Americans,”
Markowitz said.

“The U.S. government has de-
ﬁned them as domestic dependent
sovereigns in this Indian commu-
nity, so it’s like visiting a different
country. You don’t ﬁnd that with
any other ethnic group.”

Markowitz said experiencing
other cultures is essential not only
to students but to all Americans.

“It’s fundamental in terms of
testing and questioning assump-
tions we take for granted,” Mar-
kowitz said. ’

“There’s a lot of fruit to be
gathered by seeing the world.”

Service programs teach students about poverty, inspire young minds to change economic state of nation

By Catherine Carlock
C 0 PY E D ITO R

Red bricks, white columns and
an overwhelming mob of pink po-
los: Welcome to Washington and
Lee University.

With tuition and fees above
$40,000 and a per student endow-
ment of over $200,000, W&L
doesn’t seem like it would be the
venue to study poverty.

Enter Harlan Beckley, former
acting President of W&L. A for-
mer Religion professor with a
doctorate in Christian Theologi-
cal Ethics, Beckley’s main focus
these days is the Shepherd Pov-
erty Program.

It was with Beckley’s insis-
tence and the support of Nancy
and Tom Shepherd that the Pov-
erty Program was founded at
W&L.

The Shepherd Program has
been nationally recognized as one
of the most groundbreaking un-
dergraduate college programs in
the United States. ‘

The Shepherd Program also
works in conjunction with the Na-
bors Service League, which spon-
sors the Nabors Service Day and
numerous other projects.

The popularity of Nabors Ser-
vice Day, the Shepherd Program,
and other service programs like
the Campus Kitchen Project show
that W&L students are ready and
willing to give back to the com-
munity.

Nabors’ next event is Hunger
and Homelessness Awareness
Week.

It is nationally co-sponsored
by the National Coalition for the
Homeless (NCH) and the National
Student Campaign Against Hun-
ger & Homelessness (NSCAHH).

NCH, a not-for-profit program,
sponsors numerous other events
each year.

NSCAHH is another not—for-
proﬁt organization whose goal
is to educate and train students
about hunger and homelessness
in America.

The campaign is also focusing
on a grassroots-level movement
to help put an end to poverty and
hunger.

“We really want to make [the]
Washington and Lee students and
community more aware of the is-
sues that surround them, and this
week in particular about hunger
and homelessness,” NSL general
chair Sonia Siu said.

ment.

There are no set events or pro-
grams; each separate community
is responsible for coordinating the
event. _

Nabors has several events
throughout the week that will
hopefully raise awareness con-
cerning poverty and hunger.

The ﬁrst of these events is the
Oxfam Hunger Banquet, held
Tuesday, Nov. 14 from 6-8 p.m.
in Evans Dining Hall.

Tickets are $5 and may be
swiped home or purchased at the
door

The Hunger Banquet is a na-
tionally sponsored event that of-
fers an interesting perspective on
hunger throughout the world.

Each person attending the ban-
quet is randomly assigned a role
in a high-income group, a middle-

income group, or a low—income
group.

The high-income group sits
at a table and eats a three-course
meal. The middle-income group
consumes rice and beans while
sitting in chairs. The group rep-
resenting low incomes sits on the
ﬂoor and receives rice and water.

The keynote speaker at this
year’s Oxfam Hunger Banquet
will be Beckley.

On Nov. 16, Nabors will host
an Art Show with a reception and
a Homeless Panel. The panel will
be comprised of two people who
have experienced homelessness
and one staffer on the NCH.

“By going to these events, [ev-
ery person is] going to learn about
ways they can take individual
steps to help some of the people
that are suffering through some of
these issues,” Siu said.

Also this week, the Campus
Kitchen Project is sponsoring a
“5 for 5” event, where W&L stu-
dents can donate to the Project.

For every dollar donated, CKP
will be matched $5. W&L stu-
dents will also receive ﬁve cook-
ies per dollar contributed.

NCH or the NSL do not spon-
sor the event, but it is another op-
portunity to help out CKP.

Men's Cross Country

The Washington and Lee men’s
cross country team ﬁnished
seventh overall at the NCAA
regional championships on
Saturday afternoon at Emory
University. W&L was led by
sophomore Vance Berry, who
ﬁnished 18th overall in a time
of 26: 1 5.3. Sophomore Michael
Welsh and junior Tom Brower
also paced the Generals, ﬁn-
ishing 21st and 33rd overall,
respectively. Berry, Welsh,
and Brower all received all-
regional accolades. Former
W&L star Alex Mahoney, who
transferred to “Rhodes College
this season, won the race in
a time of 25:41.6. Mahoney,
who ran side-by-side with his
former teammates, will next
compete at the NCAA national
championships. The regional
championships was the Gen-
erals’ last race of the season,
ending a very successful 2006
campaign.

Men's Swimming

The Washington and Lee men’s
swimming team continued
its winning ways on Sunday
afternoon when they downed
Gettysburg College by a score
of 153-49. Seniors Kevin Hayes
and Mike Ginder each won a
pair of individual events and
swam on the winning 400 med-
ley relay team. Hayes won the
200 IM and won the 200 breast-
stroke, while Ginder won the
200 free and the 200 back. The
two were joined on the victori-
ous 400 medley relay team by
junior Alex Sweet and freshman
Winston Stagg. The men return
to action on Saturday when they
travel to Franklin & Marshall
for a tri-meet against the host
and Carnegie Mellon. The meet
is set to begin at l p.m.

Women's Swimming

The Washington and Lee wom-
en’s swimming team had one
win and two losses this past
weekend. In ODAC competi-
tion, the Generals defeated
Guilford College 224-32 but
lost to Randolph-Macon 135-
126. On Sunday, the Generals
lost to Gettysburg 134-71. In
the Gettysburg meet, W&L
women had a pair of indi-
vidual winners as sophomore
Lindsey Strachan won the
200 backstroke and freshman
Jenna Worsham won the 200
IM. In the ODAC tri-meet, the
Generals were paced by strong
performances from Worsham,
who captured the 200 free and
the 200 breast, and also was
a member of the winning 200
free relay. Strachan won the
200 back and captured second
in the 500 free, while Susan
Mahoney touched the wall ﬁrst
in the 200 IM and second in the
100 free. The women return to
action on Saturday when they
travel to Franklin & Marshall
for a tri-meet against the host

and Carnegie Mellon.

Men swim to a victory over Gettysburg, while women come up short on Sunday

By Lara Jordan.
STAFF WRITER

The men’s and women’s swim
teams begin their seasons with
a positive outlook, as well as a
strong record, having some of the
fastest individual and relay times
in the nation.

“Individually, Tim McGlaston
has the best 50 free time in the
country, Mike Ginder has the
fastest 200 freestyle time in the
nation, and Paul Crook has been
ranked top ten in the 500 free-
style,” saidsenior Kevin Hayes.

Hayes also said W&L’s team
is swimming signiﬁcantly faster
and is comparable to other “high—
ly regarded teams.”

With these successes, the team
has high expectations for the rest
ofthe season.

“We have set the bar very high
for ourselves this season,” said
senior Mike Ginder. “This year

lV[er1’s soccer loses to Lynchburg

we want to really make a name for
ourselves on the national level.”

In order to accomplish this
goal, Ginder says the team needs
to accomplish two things: have
an undefeated dual meet record
(which means beating Johns Hop-
kins) and ﬁnish in the top-ﬁve at
the NCAA Division III Champi-
onships. ,

The women have similar
goals.

“Our goal as a team is to be
undefeated against the ODAC
teams,” said senior captain Ab-
bie Sauter. “We also want to win
ODACs for the 14th straight year.
Another goal is to break every
single relay record.”

Part of the reason for the teams’
achievements is their workouts.

“This year’s training regimen
has been signiﬁcantly more diffi-
cult than last year, but everyone
has been able to meet the chal-
lenge,” said Hayes. ‘‘It has been

showing with our times.”

One new difference in the
teams’ workouts is the addition of
dryland practices.

According to freshman Jona-
than Giesen, they include more
technical aspects, including lift-
ing.
“We have more intense work-
outs all week long and we are
also doing dryland workouts three
days a week that will help us in
the pool,” said Giesen.

These intensiﬁed practices
make up for their disadvantage of
having only one practice a day.

“We are one of the few teams
in the country that practices only
once a day,” said senior Dave
Croushore. “This all means that
we have to work harder and smart-
er than other teams to achieve the
same results.”

Also, the incoming freshmen
have contributed to the team’s
overall triumph.

“The incoming freshmen have
been an asset to the team from the
outset.” said Hayes. “We have
some very impressive swimmers
strengthening some weak spots
from last year or adding depth to
the lineup. The incoming fresh-
men are keeping the sophomores
and upperclassmen working hard
to keep their positions in the line-
up, which only makes us better
collectively.”

However, the seniors continue
to be the heart of the team.

“The seniors are the lead-
ership core of this team,” said
Croushore. “Not only are three of
the ﬁve seniors strong candidates
for All-America honors, the ﬁve
of us have been with the team
as long as Joel [Shinoﬁeld, head
coach]. We have been through
three years and seen this team
through many different times.
We want to leave this program on
top.”

For the women, the team has
to overcome the disadvantage
of losing 11 members from last

year’s team.

“I’d say maybe the fact that we
are a young team could be viewed

[as a disadvantage],” said Sauter.
“However, we have all grown tre-

mendously this season already,
and I think the fact that the team is
so young and already so good is a
great thing, because next year the
team will still be just as strong, if

not stronger.”

The team also attributes their

success to their coach Shinoﬁeld.

“He knows exactly what it

takes to accomplish our goals

for the end of the season,” said

Ginder. “He spends the time and
effort necessary to make this pro-
gram a success.”

The team competes against

Franklin & Marshall this Satur-
day, Nov. 18, and Sunday, Nov.

Generals ’seas0n comes to an end after a tough I -0 defeat in ODAC semiﬁnals

By Kevin Trempe
STAFF WRITER

For the second time in three
games, the Washington and Lee
men’s soccer team fell victim to a

disappointing defeat at the hands

of a familiar foe.

With a 1-0 loss to Lynchburg
College in the semiﬁnals of the
ODAC Championship, the Gener-
als ﬁnished the season 12-3-2 and
saw their chances at an NCAA
tournament bid disappear.

The defeat came on the heels
of a 2-0 loss to Lynchburg in the
season ﬁnale two weeks ago.

The semiﬁnal game, played at
Roanoke College’s Elizabethtown
Campus, was a defensive struggle
for the ﬁrst 45 minute period, see-
ing no goals from either side.

However, in the 65th minute
of regulation, Lynchburg senior
midﬁelder Casey Zambor broke
through the W&L defensive front
and notched what would become
the game-winning goal.

Thanks in part to two saves
by Lynchburg goalkeeper Marcus
Jordan, the Generals were unable
to respond.

Lynchburg would go on to de-
feat Virginia Wesleyan College in
the ODAC championship game,
eventually falling to North Caro-
lina Wesleyan in the ﬁrst round of
the NCAA Division III Touma-
ment.

W & L learned on last Sunday
that they would not receive an
at-large bid to the NCAA tourna-
ment.

Despite the disappointing ﬁn-

ish, the season was widely viewed
as a success.

The 12-3-2 ﬁnish marked the
Generals’ best record since 2000.
The team began the season unde-
feated for their ﬁrst ten games,
and outscored their opponents 42-
9 for the season.

The 2006 campaign also saw
the 250th win for Head Coach
Rolf Piranian, who garnered much
success in his 315‘ season at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Another mark of success were
the individual accolades acquired
by players.

Two Generals were recently
named to the CoSIDA/ESPN
the Magazine College Division
III Academic All-District Team.
The award, presented to seniors
Scot Pittman and Rhett McCraw,

honors starting athletes who earn
a 3.2 or higher GPA and contrib-
ute signiﬁcantly to their team’s
success. For many, though, the
season meant more than awards,
milestones, and victories.

The successes of this year built
a foundation for teams to come.
Freshman midﬁelder Drew Crow-
ley said that the season “was a
great experience,” and that “a lot
of it should be owed to the leader-
ship on the team.”

“I am extremely excited for
next season and hope to continue
the legacy left behind by the se-
niors of this year’s team. They
will deﬁnitely be missed, and we
will need to ﬁll their shoes next
year.” ‘

The Generals will lose six se-
niors next season, including cap-

tains and leading defensemen J .D.
McDermott, Alex Phillips, and
Scot Pittman.

However, returning players
will include leading goal scorers
Jack Palmer and Josh Dodds, both
expected to make signiﬁcant con-
tributions to the team’s success as
seniors. Also returning will be
starting goalkeeper Ted Sheedy,
who picked up eight shutouts this
season, allowing a total of seven
goals in 15 games.

W & L will advance into the
2007 season with each of their top
ﬁve scorers from this year.

Despite losing starters from
the defense that played a large
role in this season’s victories, all
indications point to continued
success and heightened expecta-
tions for next fall.

Record season led
by senior captains

By Mlke Fahey
SPORTS EDITOR

 

After a record run in the
NCAA championships, the
Washington and Lee volleyball
team fell to Stevens Institute of
Techology on Saturday evening
in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA
tournament.

The Generals also beat out
top-seeded NYU in a surprising
upset.

Making it to the Sweet 16
was the best result in the pro-
gram’s history.

Senior captain Ashley Hurt
said, “It was thrilling to make it
to the Sweet 16 for the ﬁrst time
ever, and I am so proud to be a
part of this team. Unfortunate-
ly, the crowd was tough, which
worked for the other team and
against us.”

The crowd was very tough
as the Generals played Stevens
Institute on their home court, as
the men’s soccer team had just
won the regional champion-
ship.

Hurt said, “Everyone was
rowdy. It will be interesting to
see how their team does with-
out their fans.”

The ﬁfth—seed in their sec-
tion of the tournament, the
Generals lost to second-seeded
Stevens Tech 26-30, 38-40, 30-
22, 22-30. , -v - _

In the game, the Generals
were led by junior right side
Jess Hudock’s 13 kills and three
service aces, while sophomore
outside hitter Laura Maurer
made 11 kills. Freshman setter
Kristi Stevens tallied 22 as-
sists, and senior libero Lauren
Edmonson added 16 digs and
three service aces.

The Generals’ biggest victo-
ry of the season came on Friday,
when they defeated top-seeded
and l6th-ranked NYU in a ﬁve-
game battle, 25-30, 30-28, 30-
19, 29-31,15-13.

In the game, Edmonson led
the Generals with a school-
record 11 service aces and a
team-high 25 digs.

Sophomore middle blocker
Kassie Bagley tallied 12 kills
and eight blocks, while Maurer
added ll kills and 16 digs. Hu-
dock racked up nine kills and
18 digs and junior setter Lauren

Senior captain Ashley Hurt helped bring together a young team in the Sweet 16

 Bittersweet 16 ends

tournament in Hoboken, NJ. on Saturday. The record season ended against SIT.

Rudolph totaled 29 assists.

Rudolph said, “Beating
_NYU was the biggest accom-
plishment for the W&L volley-
ball program.

“It was an amazing feeling,
coming out and beating the
number one seed in the region
when no one expects you to
win.”

On the season as a whole,
the Generals were aided by
their strong leadership, behind
captains Hurt and Edmonson.

Rudolph praised Hurt, say-
ing, “[She] was amazing this
year, and was often underrated
and her talents weren't ac-
knowledged nearly enough.

“She was out for practically

the whole season last year and
came back to be a huge part of
our tournament run.”

Hurt led the team in kills
against Vassar and blocked sol-
idly against NYU, which played
a huge factor in their victory.

Hurt played through a lot of
pain this year, and yet still came
through to make 227 kills.

The leadership of the Gener-
als played a large role in their
success this season.

Senior libero Lauren Ed-
monson set a school record for
most digs in a season, breaking
her own record.

Hudock added, “With such a
young team it can be hard to set
the right example, but [Edmon-

son and Hurt] really gave us a
great model for playing with
consistency, a positive attitude,
and a lot of heart.”

As Rudolph put it, “These
two ladies were wonderful cap-
tains, fantastic teammates, and
reliable players this_entire sea-
son.”

With their 2006 season over,
the Generals exceeded all ex-
pectations that had been set for
them.

Hudock said, “It was very
surreal to be playing in the
Sweet l6--the concept of it was
really hard to grasp, but it felt
like a huge validation of all the
hard work our team has accom-
plished this season.”

Wrestling
with hunger

Team works to make weight as they
prepare for season with young players

By Joel Poelhuls
8 TA FF W R I TE R

In wrestling, the hunger for
victory must overcome the hun-
ger for food.

Long runs and skipped meals
are necessities for those trying
to make weight requirements,
and an integral part of the sport
is maintaining the body to exact
speciﬁcations of weight and body
fat index.

“Nobody enjoys losing
weight, it’s just something you
have to do,” said freshman Jamie
Goodin.

“Cutting weight is deﬁnitely
the part that makes wrestling dif-
ferent from other sports,” senior
captain Max Courtney said. “It
really teaches you self-disci-
pline.”

The Generals are coming off
their first meet of the season last
week at the Southern Virginia

“We ’re shooting for a

top—four team ﬁnish at

)

conference. ’

MAX COURTNEY, captaln
 

University Knight Open. Court-
ney, juniors Kirk Adamson, An-
thony Boniello, David Shubick,
Erick Gagne and sophomore Rob
Terrin all won in their weight
classes. The team returns nine
starters from last year and has sol-
id players spread throughout the
weight classes rather than one or
two stars. Having depth especial-
ly helps the team in dual meets,
where every point counts.

The Generals are led by Head
Coach Gary Franke, Assistant
Coach Rolf Piranian, and team
captains Courtney and junior Jes-
se Sataloff. Sataloff is currently
recovering from a shoulder inju-
ry, and freshman Zak Colangelo
is prepared to take over the 174-
pound slot until his return.

“Your teammates are really
important, not just for putting up
points for the team, but for push-
ing each other to succeed in the
practice room,” Courtney said.

Last season the team posted a
5-5 record (3-4 in the conference)

and was ranked 13”‘ in the Nation-
al Coaches Wrestling Association
Division III Scholar All-Ameri-
can Team poll.

“Coach Franke deﬁnitely puts
a lot of emphasis on balance be-
tween the mat and the classroom,”
Courtney said.

Franke has coached the wres-
tling team for 34 years, and boasts
three conference titles.

“He’s really mellow and
knowledgeable, which makes it
really easy to learn new things in
practice,” Goodin explained.

Courtney, the lone senior on
the team, described the program’s
development. He said, “When I
was a freshman, we only had four
active guys on the roster. Coach
F ranke went out and recruited and
brought in three solid classes be-
hind us. We’ve gone from being
the -laughingstock of the confer-
ence to being able to ﬁeld a full
team and be competitive. Our
program has come a long way,”
Courtney said.

In wrestling, Washington and
Lee is now a member of the Cen-
tennial Conference rather than the
Old Dominion, because no other
Old Dominion schools have wres-
tling programs.

Most of them dropped wres-
tling as a sport after the Title IX
amendment to the Civil Rights
Act. Title IX, which regulatesthe
equality of men’s and woméri’s
sports, has hit wrestling especial-
ly hard because it is an all-male
sport that does not produce a lot
of revenue.

W & L is the only D-III school
in Virginia to maintain a wres-
tling program. The top competi-
tion in the Centennial Conference
is Ursinus and McDaniel, both of
which were nationally ranked last
year.

“We’re shooting for a top four
team ﬁnish at conference,” Court-
ney said. This would involve four
individuals placing in the touma-
ment. "

The Generals’ next meet will
be away at Ursinus on Saturday,
Nov. 18.

Courtney said despite the hun-
ger and pain, the level of com-
petition makes it all worthwhile.
“There’s no better feeling in the
world than getting your hand
raised after a match, knowing that
you beat that guy.”

Athletes who play nice play Well

Well-mannered athletes show that showboating jerks don ’t have the stats to support their wicked ways

ByAdam Lewls
COLUMNIST

If you have seen any episode
of Sportscenter in the past few
months, then you probably have
noticed that players like Terrell
Owens and Chad Johnson can’t
go a day without an outlandish
comment or a
controversial
act.

And when
the terribly un-
fortunate event
occurs that they
do not make
headlines, they
make sure to
redeem themselves in the eyes of
America by providing our coun-
try with its favorite form of ab-
surd entertainment.

But while T.O. and Ocho Cin-
co are making fools of themselves
and helping their team go .500,

 

Sure, Peyton Manning had a ton to do with

those stats, but guess what? Peyton Manning

is a class act, too...

 

players like Marvin Harrison and
Tiki Barber are not only quietly
compiling league-leading sta-
tistics, but they are leading their
respective teams to division leads
and possibly the Super Bowl.

I don’t know about you, but
I prefer good football over good
smack talk and celebrations.
Now, I’m not denying that the
antics of players like Owens and
Johnson make the game entertain-
ing, but when it comes down to it,
you could have the dance moves
of Emmitt Smith on “Dancing
with the Stars” and still miss the
playoffs.

So essentially it’s up to you.
Do you prefer Chad’s guarantees
for touchdowns and victory or
Marvin’s actual touchdowns and
actual victories? Terrell’s team-
bashing or Tiki’s linebacker-
smashing? Here’s what I think:

Over the past ﬁve seasons, no
one has caught more touchdowns
than Marvin Harrison.

And sure, Peyton Manning
had a ton to do with those stats,
but guess what? Peyton Manning
is a class act, too. If you watch
any Indianapolis Colts game, you
will see touchdowns being scored
at will, and what happens after

Peyton and Marvin dominate de-
fenses?

They pump their ﬁsts, hand
the ball to the ref, give some high
ﬁves, and walk off the ﬁeld to
prepare for their next offensive
lesson. ,

Also, over the last ﬁve seasons,
Tiki Barber leads all players in to-
tal yards from scrimmage. He is
accompanied by Peyton ’s brother,
Eli, who is also very classy. Few
players have had more hype and
media coverage than Eli in the last
couple of years, yet you don’t see
Eli saying: “You can’t stop #10.
No one can stop Uno Cero!”

Instead, he and Tiki simply an-
swer questions as they are asked,
score touchdowns, and write
children’s books (well, that’s just
Tiki). I

And now, let me take this a
ste further, because I know that
someone wants to comment on
the Colts’ and Giants’ inability

to win championships recently.
Let’s look at teams who have won
Super Bowls.

The Pittsburgh Steelers. Hines
Ward and Troy Polamalu, two of
their star players, don’t shine by
wearing Lance Armstrong jerseys
on the training bike because they
hurt their hamstring.

Instead, they play their hearts
out on each down. After either
one of them makes a big play,
they celebrate by making another
play of similar magnitude.

And how about the Patri-
ots? Tom Brady is one of the
most tasteful players in the NFL,
and I’m not just referring to his
looks.

He has an astonishingly suc-
cessful record in the playoffs,
among the sport’s best, but he
doesn’t have to make a chart
of the comerbacks who he has
thrown touchdown passes over.

Rather, he respectably talks to

the media, impressively leads his I

team to victory after victory, and
needless to say, he enviably dated
Tara Reid.

Who are you dating, Chad
Johnson?

In summation, the message is
clear: Chad, you don’t need to
propose marriage to cheerlead-
ers to win. Nor do you have to
translate your jersey number into
Spanish. Terrell, you don’t need
to pop dozens of pills to make it
on TV. But yes, in order to win,
you should stay awake during
team meetings. .

So guys, in January when you
are diligently designing touch-
down celebrations and meticu-
lously constructing methods of
making headlines, use your Santa
Monica/UT Chattanooga educa-
tions to read the headlines that re-
ally matter.

And then, Chad, go do some-
thing about the Mohawk.

The Washington and Lee women’s cross country team start their race at the NCAA regional championships.

Next stop, nationals

Burns and Telfeyan named all—regi0nal and qualzﬁz for NCAA national championship

By Mike Fahey
SPORTS EDITOR

11.11.06. That one date has
had an incredible amount of sig-
niﬁcance for the women’s cross
country team for the past three
months.

Nov. 6, 2006 was the date of
the NCAA Regional champion-
ships, held at Emory University
in Atlanta. After an ODAC cham-
pionship, the Washington and Lee
women’s cross country team was
focused on their goal of a strong
performance at regionals.

Sophomore Jackie Burns said,
“We’ve been wearing match-
ing bracelets all season with the
11.11.06 etched in them to keep
us focused on regionals.”

The top seven runners for
the Generals competed this past
weekend, with Burns ﬁnishing
the race ﬁfth overall in a time of
23:13.0. Freshman Kat Telfeyan
ﬁnished ninth overall with a time
of 23:40.7.

With their performances, both
Bums and Telfeyan received
all-region accolades and auto-
matically qualiﬁed to race at the
NCAA Championships.

The Generals were also led by
sophomore Becca Taylor, who ﬁn-
ished 22nd overall, and freshman

Elizabeth Krausnick, who crossed
the ﬁnish line 34th overall. Both
Taylor and Krausnick were also
named to the all-region team for
their performances.

in the team competition, the
Generals ﬁnished in a tie for third
with Mary Washington. After cal-
culations and a tie-breaker, W&L
was victorious over Mary Wash-
ington and was awarded with
third place honors.

Regionals have been the
team’s main focus since the ﬁrst
day of the preseason. The team
hoped to perform better than they
had last season, when the Gener-
als had ﬁnished fourth overall.

Senior captain Jenny Ratzel
said, “We came into the season
focusing on regionals from day
one. We held ourselves to higher
expectations this year. After we
won ODACS the past two years
we thought we were ready to step
it up a level, so we set our eyes on
qualifying for nationals.”

However, the warm Geor-
gia weather proved to be in the
Generals’ favor, as cloudy, warm
conditions were excellent for run-
ning.

“The course was nice and
the weather in Atlanta was a lot
warmer than here, so it was a nice
break,” Telfeyan said.

The Generals have had great
support coming from all direc-
tions this season. “From cookies
to cheering us on at out-of-town
meets, our friends and alums have
committed a lot of time to sup-
porting us,” Ratzel said.

Burns added, “We even had
a surprise visit from our captain
Lindsay Erickson and track coach
Nate Hoey. It’s always comfort-
ing to ﬁnd a familiar face in the
chaos of colors and ponytails.”

The team also had a close bond
to each other, as Coach Kris Hoey
planned many team activities to
promote enthusiasm throughout
the season.

“I think that our team is very
close and it helped that we did
a lot of things together,” Kraus-
nick said, “We had secret buddies
and we went to many team din-
ners which made us have a strong
bond.”

For a season that featured an
ODAC championship as well as a
third place ﬁnish at regionals, the
Generals have a lot to be proud
of.

“We had two people instantly
qualify for nationals, which is a
huge deal. Everyone was really
pumped about the race and tried
their hardest,” freshman Mary
Frances Weatherly said.

Most importantly, the team
placed third overall, which goes
to show its depth and strength,
from the ﬁrst person to cross the
ﬁnish line to the last.

“The girls really put them-
selves on the line for this race.”
Burns said, “You could deﬁnitely
see it in their ﬁnishes.”

While this race was the last
meet of the season for many of
the girls, other will carry on to na-
tionals and many will compete in
indoor or outdoor track.

“We’re the bomb-dot-com and
it’s been a great senior season,”
Ratzel said. “The entire team put
so much time, sweat and heart
into this season. We wouldn’t
have been nearly as successful if
we didn’t have every single per-
son on this team. We’re not only
teammates but we’re friends and
after spending so much time to-
gether.”

Burns and Telfeyan will next
compete at the NCAA national
championships, which will be
held on Saturday, November 17 at
12:00 pm at the Voice of America
Park in West Chester, Ohio.

Burns said, “We’re both very
excited for nationals, but not quite
sure what to expect--only that it
will be a very talented and hum-
bling ﬁeld.”

Soccer scores to Sweet 16

Caulkins ’Sec0nd-half goals lifts women ’s soccer team to a 1-0 victory over Maryville

By Mike Fahey
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee
women’s soccer team advanced
to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA
tournament with a thrilling 1-0
win over Maryville College on
Sunday night.

The 24th-ranked

Score Generals set a pro-
W &L 1 gram. record for

, wins in a season, as
MarYV1”e 0 their victory over

Maryville was their
18th of the season. This will also
be only the second time in pro-
gram history that the Generals
have advanced to the Sweet 16.

The ﬁrst half of the Maryville
game was a score battle, but just
45 seconds into the second half,
junior forward Martha Caulkins
found the back of the net off an
assist from senior captain Anne
Wiltshire. It was Caulkins’ tenth
goal of the season and Wiltshire’s

sixth assist.

The goal would be all that the
Generals needed to secure the vic-
tory, as sophomore Kiki Moreo
posted the Generals 19th shut-out
of the season.

Caulkins said, “We tried to use
the same strategy that we used in
the past. We came out hard from
the very beginning.”

The Generals dominated play,
only allowing one shot on goal.
While their offense made the dif-
ference in the score, their defense
was also stellar, as W&L out-shot
their opponents 20-1.

While the Generals played in
Maryville, Tenn. for the weekend,
their fans did not forget about
them. Many parents attended the
game to show their support for
the team, and there was even fac-
ulty support as Professor Kenneth
Lambert and Associate Professor
Dick Grefe made the trip to Ten-
nessee.

After a week of hard practices

and even a 6:30 a.m. practice on
Friday before making their trip to
Tennessee, the Generals worked
hard for their victories this past
weekend.

In their ﬁrst round game, the
Generals crushed Meredith Col-
lege in dominant fashion, 6-0.

The Generals were led by
sophomore forward Anne Van
Devender, who notched a hat
trick. In doing so, Van Devender
broke the W&L single season
record for points scored, as the
goals brought her season total to
57. She also tied a school record
with 23 goals on the season.

Also scoring for the Gener-
als was forward Wiltshire, who
scored off an assist from senior
forward Sarah Helms. Shana 01t-
mans scored the ﬁfth goal of the
game for the Generals off an as-
sist from midﬁelder Kate Corr.
Sophomore defender Marissa
Van Brunt also ‘added a goal for
the Generals off a free kick from

nearly 30 yards out with minutes
left in the game.

Moreo and senior goalkeeper
Emily Binns both played in goal
for the Generals.

The Generals relied on their
strong defense and dominant
offense, since it carried them
through their season. .

Caulkins described, “Our
backs are awesome. Our defense
shut them down.”

The Generals will next take
on Washington University in St.
Louis. The location of the game
is still to be determined. Wash U
is the top seeded team in the Gen-
erals’ section of the draw, but the
Generals are going to be up to the
task.

Caulkins said, “We’ll all be
nervous. Everyone is so ﬁred up.
We’re so excited that we feel like
we can take on anybody if we
work hard enough. We’re playing
really well, and hopefully we can
keep that up.”

Fire damages students ‘country house,
but none of the occupants are injured

By Alden Wlcker
STAFF WRITER

Junior Phi Psi and swimmer
Alex Sweet lost all ofhis belong-
ings when his off-campus house
caught ﬁre last Wednesday.

“Basically, my room was sub-
merged in flames,” Sweet said.

Sweet and his two housemates,
Bret Cogan and Chris Pow, have
also been forced to move out of
their house at Beans River Bot-
tom. The house is now unin-
habitable after the ﬁre gutted a
downstairs bathroom and Sweet‘s
bedroom.

The ﬁre started in the bath-
room when Pow's towel got stuck
in the small electrical heater--
which Pow had left turned on--
below the towel rack and caught
ﬁre. Within 15 minutes, the ﬁre
moved through the drywood walls
and up into Sweet’s closet above
the bathroom.

Cogan was in his second sto-
ry bedroom checking his email
around 8 am. when he smelled
smoke.

“I opened my door and it was
white with smoke. You could not
breathe or see,” he said.

He ran out to the balcony and
called 911. Then he jumped off.
He went back inside and tried to
put out the ﬁre with a ﬁre extin-
guisher, but he realized that most
of it was inside the walls.

Meanwhile, Sweet was just
getting out of class and got the
message from Cogan saying the
house was on ﬁre. He rushed
home.

“On the way I heard all these
sirens, and I was like ‘Dammit,"”

Country needs to quiet down

Sweet said. “I knew those were
for my house.”

When he got there, there were
ﬁve engines from three different
stations attending to the ﬁre.

The ﬁre engulfed Sweets bed-
room. It moved from the closet to
his bed, blew out the windows.
and burned his other closet. It
climbed the wall and bumed
through the roof.

Now the room is a charred
black hole.

“My TV got melted in half."
Sweet said. “I lost every article of
clothing I have."

His ﬁsh were also burnt alive
invtheir ﬁsh tank.

“They died a pretty terrible
death,” he said. “I feel really bad
about that.”

Although he was lucky enough
to have his computer and books
with him, Sweet thinks his grades
will probably suffer, especially
since he lost thousands of note
cards he had made up for his bio-
chemistry class.

There was also “tremendous
water damage” to the whole
house. The ﬁre department cl1ain-
sawed a hole in Sweet‘s roof and
put hoses in to put out the ﬂames.
The downstairs was damaged by
smoke, with holes smashed in the
walls where the ﬁre department
checked for ﬂames. Plaster, dry-
wall, and mud covered the floor
where the ﬁreﬁghters trooped
through.

“It is completely unlivable."
Sweet said.

The house’s exterior looks nor-
mal, except for a boarded up win-
dow upstairs and an inconspicu-
ous tarp stretched over the hole in

the roof. According to the ﬁre de-
partment, there is about $50,000
worth of damage to the house. It
won‘t be renovated and ready to
live in again until next year.
Sweet and Cogan have moved
into a suite in Gaines Hall for the
remainder of the year. Pow moved
into 21 KA house at Beans Bottom
with his fraternity brothers.
Although Pow was the one who

leﬁ the heater on, his housemates
don’t blame the ﬁre on him.

“None of us are mad at Chris,”
Sweet said. “We don’t blame him;
it was a mistake anyone could
have made.”

Pow would not comment.

Sweet thinks the blame rests
with the poor upkeep of the
house.

“My house was a matchstick

waiting to erupt,” he said. “I re-
alize now it was really stupid to
live there.”

He hopes this will serve as
a wake-up call to students who
move into run-down housing.

“I will be more diligent to
check that kind of thing,” Sweet
said.

But Cogan, who did not lose
anything in the ﬁre, is just happy

the landlords are not angry at
them.

“They have also been really
easy to work with,” he said.

When Sweet’s mother helped
the boys move their stuff into the
house, she tried to tell the boys
the house was a ﬁre hazard.

“My mom told us ‘This place
is going to burn down,’” Sweet
says. “Sure enough, it did.”

Supervisors say noisy students must continue working to find common ground with their neighbors

By Jacob Geiger
N EWS EDITOR

Julia Garrett is one of the
neighbors bothered by the student
parties on Windfall. She lives
across from Winding Way Road
— the driveway that goes to the

_ Windfall Hill houses.

“The music gets tumed down,
but the [Traveller] buses keep
running until 2 am. and there is
a roar of voices,” Garrett said.
“This goes on Wednesday through
Saturday. What I want to empha-
size is that when the music stops,
the party is not over.”

Country parties are safe again
alter the Rockbridge County
Board of Supervisors decided last
Monday not to pass a tougher,
more restrictive noise ordinance.

Instead, the board will let
students and their neighbors try
to work out a solution that satis-
ﬁes all groups. But the supervi-

-sors warned that students living

on Windfall Hill and at the Pole
Houses must keep working with
their neighbors if the current
peace is going to hold.

“If the students behave and the
neighbors are satisﬁed, we will
leave things alone," said Harvey
Hotinger, the supervisor who rep-
resents the area around Windfall
Hill and the Pole Houses. “We
are just trying to make the neigh-
bors happy.”

Garrett said that she would be
happy if the compromise between
students and neighbors works, but
she said some serious problems
need to be addressed.

Repeated complaints by neigh-
bors who live near the student
party areas prompted the board
to consider a much stricter plan.
The proposed ordinance would
have required a permit for parties
with loud music or more than 30
people.

“lfthe students behave and the neighbors are

.s'ati.sﬁed, we will leave things alone. We are just

trying to make the neighbors happy. ”

HARVEY HOTINGER, Rockbrldge County Board of Supervisors

The ordinance also would
have harmed music and other loud
noises after 10 p.m. on weeknights
and after midnight on weekends.

Students and administrators
from Washington and Lee turned
out Monday night to argue that a
new noise ordinance was unnec-
essary Most of the people from
W&L have been serving on the
Community Campus Coalition, a
group Director of Student Health
Jane Horton started last fall with
Dean of Students Dawn Watkins.

Executive Committee Presi-

dent Rob Rain told the board
he was concerned that a stricter
ordinance might drive a wedge
between students and the com-
munity.

“Since the student body be-
came fully aware of the serious-
ness of this issue, many steps have
been taken to resolve this issue in
a civil manner,” Raid said during
his speech to the board.

Garrett Clark, a sophomore
who will be living on Windfall
Hill next year, is a member of the
coalition. He asked the board to

postpone action on the ordinance.

Clark also said he thought
the proposed ordinance was far
too broad. He said the ordinance
could have unintended conse-
quences that would harm other
residents of the county.

Clark said that if county resi-
dents want to have a weekday
party, under the proposed ordi-
nance they would have to register
the party and then send everyone
home at 10 p.m.

Residents who live near the
student houses said the coalition
had been working hard to ﬁnd
common ground. The coalition
held a meet-and-greet earlier this
month for at the Pole Houses for
students and neighbors. Another
dinner is planned for Wednesday
night on Windfall Hill.

David Dugan said he went to
the ﬁrst meet-and-greet dinner
and was pleased with the results.
“Allow us and the students to con-

tinue to work together,” he said.

Don Ford, who lives near
Windfall Hill on Woodridge Lane,
said he had seen a difference in
student behavior this year.

“I hope things continue to

improve,” he said. “I would not
mind giving the students more
time if they continue being seri-
ous.”
Neighbor Ed Bauer told the
board to enforce the ordinance it
has now. “Bring [the proposed
ordinance] back up if problems
continue,” he said.

The coalition has also invited
landlords and law enforcement
ofﬁcials to share their input.

Joe Shaner, the landlord for
Windfall Hill, told the board that
he has enjoyed good relationships
with his student tenants.

“We are now renting to the
second generation in some cases,”

Stopping sexual assault I

Summit gathers student leaders from 15 schools to discuss ways to reduce campus assaults

the numbers
behind sexual
assault at W&L:

 

college-age women will
suffer rape or attempted
rape from the time of their
14th birthday.

In the past year,

 

of female W&L students
reported sexual touching
against their will. This is

 

the national average.

In a recent survey of
the student body asking
students to classify various
scenarios as “rape” or “not
rape," women and men
differed significantly

  %

of the time.

Relations Committee

enior Matthew Loar is a
busy guy.

After all, combating
 sexual assault takes time
and heart.

Loar, Chairman of the Gender
Relations Committee, Co-Chair
of 1 in 4, and a volunteer at the
Project Horizon women’s crisis
center, gets his motivation from
an experience close to home. A
female friend of his was raped
while in high school but didn’t
tell anyone about it until college.

“Her situation really struck a
chord with me, and it made me
realize that since I had the power
to make some change, I needed
to,” Loar said.

Part of his work is running
the GRC. Its programs like Date
Night and Candycane grams are
designed to promote healthy gen-
der interaction. Loar’s latest proj-
ect was a GRC—sponsored summit
at W&L designed to “bring stu-
dents and administrators together
from other universities to collab-
orate on efforts to prevent sexual
assault.”

He characterizes the summit as
a big success. “We brought more
than 50 people together from 15
different schools. We spent the
weekend discussing programs,
successes, obstacles to success,
and a myriad of other topics re-
lated to sexual assault.”

    

He especially enjoyed the all-
student discussion group. “It was
refreshing for me to see so many
other students who cared about
this issue. Everybody was very
enthusiastic about taking back
new ideas to their campuses.”

The event’s. keynote speaker
was the national founder of 1 in 4,
a men’s group that educates men
about sexual assault and how to
help survivors. It takes its name
from the statistic that one in four
college-age women will suffer
rape or attempted rape from the
time of their 14th birthday.

Chapter Co-Chair Bill Larson
believes l in 4’s presentations
and sponsorships are paying off.

“The number of sexual as-
saults at W&L seems to have
lessened slightly and awareness
has improved. . .but there is still a
lot to be done.”

Larson believes sexual assault
is offensive to the “honor and ci-
vility inherent in the W&L com-
munity. All members of the com-
munity should work to end sexual
assault on our campus.”

Junior Paten Hughes, the pres-
ident of Knowledge Empowering
Women Leaders (KEWL), says
getting people involved is an im-
portant part of the solution. “We
have to ﬁnd a way to penetrate
the culture, to work within it.”

KEWL sponsors monthly dis-
cussion forums--including one
on sexual assault--and is selling
T-shirts in the commons atrium

“Every group at this university has the power

to  alter the kind of environment that fosters

the behavior that leads to sexual assault. ”

Matthew Loar, chairman of the Gender Relations Committee

 

for charity. KEWL’s mission is
“to form a community of great
women who are leaders, who are
smart, who have things to say.”

Getting women to speak out is
also the goal of SPEAK, a wom-
en’s organization educating wom-
en about sexual assault. SPEAK’s
membership has tripled since its
first meeting, and it produced a
video and program to present to
all freshmen women in the fall.

SPEAK President Catie Ful-
ton said, “We want women on this
campus to be aware of the vari-
ous resources available to them
if they or a friend have been as-
saulted. Talking about sexual as-
sault. . .is one of the ﬁrst steps, in
my opinion, towards eliminating
the problem.”

In addition to presentations to
freshmen, SPEAK sponsors pro-
grams like Take Back the Night, a
vigil against sexual assault featur-
ing survivors.

University Counselor Jenni-
fer Sayre points to W&L’s high
sexual assault rate as evidence of
a problem.

Theta Pi wants to

re-colonize on campus

Members of the last pledge class say they felt betrayed by Beta nationals

By Cody Beauchamp
STAFF wmrrn

They’re bringing Beta back.

Yep.

The Beta Theta Pi fraternity
hopes to re-colonize a chapter at
Washington and Lee University,
conﬁrmed J.B. Scherpelz, the
organization’s Director of Expan-
sion and Recruitment.

Scherpelz (representing the
fraternity) and Jason Rodocker
(representing the University as
Director of Student Activities and
Greek Life) both conﬁrmed that
preliminary discussions were al-
ready underway about the possi-
bility of Beta re-colonizing.

The chapter was suspended
from campus in 2004 for hazing
incidents.

University Director of Re-
ligious Life William C. “Burr”
Datz, who was involved with in-
vestigating the hazing allegations,
declined to comment on what
speciﬁc hazing acts of which Beta
was accused.

According to both Datz and
Rodocker, the fraternity was
found to be in clear violation of
University anti-hazing policy and
was accordingly suspended for a
period of one year.

Rodocker said that the fra-
temity’s national ofﬁce handed
down a longer suspension to the
chapter, refusing to allow any
sanctioned activity until all of the
members of Beta at the time—in-
cluding the pledge class who had
been hazed—had graduated the
university.

Barring an unexpected compli-
cation, this would mean the sus-
pension would be lifted sometime
next year--by which time all pre-
vious Beta members are expected
to have graduated.

Rodocker said that the repre-
sentatives from the national of-
ﬁce said re-colonization could
happen shortly after. However, he
also said the national organization
wants to see what they consider
to be a strong alumni base that
would support the new chapter.

Rodocker also said the na-
tional ofﬁce has several concerns
that will need to be adressed. The
national executives are interested
to see if the chapter can sustain it-
self without reverting back to its
previous behavior.

Scherpelz said that Beta’s na-
tional organization also hoped to
see greater involvement by the re-
colonized chapter in regional and
national leadership seminars.

The fraternity’s website de-
scribes their “Men of Principle”
initiative as one that hopes to give
“a new voice to the enduring val-
ues of our Fraternity. . .calling on
men to become leaders and giv-
ing them the tools they need to do
so.”

Scherpelz said that the nation-
al organization will also stipulate
that the chapter house property be
completely dry, although he said
that this would not necessarily
mean the fraternity ‘chapter itself
would have to be dry.

Scherpelz said the ban would
only forbid alcohol on the physi-
cal grounds and property of the

“T he chapter that was suspended is not what a

Beta chapter, in the eyes of our national orga-

J

nization, should be. ’

J.B. Scherpelz, BOI1 Director of Expansion and Recruitment

 

chapter house, with possible ex-
ceptions for certain social func-
tions.

Scherpelz also added that po-
tential new members would have
to maintain a grade point average
higher than the W&L all men’s
average to receive a bid and go
through new member education.
The average male GPA at W&L
is a 3.159.

“We are anxious to return, but

if we do, we want to return as an ‘

organization that contributes and
is a valuable part of a community,
not a chapter that behaves like
the one that was suspended did,”
Sherpelz said.

“We are anxious to meet with
the university’s Inter-Frater-
nity Council and Student Affairs
Council in the spring to see how
we can go about doing that.”

To Ted Clark and Matt Leis-
man—both of whom were mem-
bers of the last Beta pledge class
before the fraternity was suspend-
ed——the stipulations are likely
going to make re-establishing the
chapter more difficult.

“If it’s going to come back
with those rules, they’re going to
have a hard time rushing people,”

said Clark.

Leisman believes any new
chapter would not see much in-
volvement from any pre-suspen-
sion brothers.

“I think all of us felt betrayed
by nationals,” said Leisman.
“None of us really want to help
them out much.”

“It’s sort of an issue too of
them not wanting to be involved
with us than us wanting to be in-
volved with them,” said Clark.

Scherpelz conﬁrmed that was
the national fratemity’s position,
saying that while he feels that
what happened to Clark’s and
Leisman’s pledge class was “un-
fortunate and deﬁnitely unfair,”
the fraternity’s national board had
already decided at the time of the
suspension that the class would
not be welcome in any future re-
colonization efforts.

“The chapter that was suspend-
ed is not what a Beta chapter, in
the eyes of our national organiza-
tion, should be,” said Scherpelz.

“When the chapter closed, it
was for very good reasons,” said
Scherpelz. “It is deﬁnitely regret-
table, but no one involved with
that is really welcome back.”

“Our numbers are higher than
national averages, which is why
we’ve been working to develop
educational programs that will
resonate with our students,” she
said.

Sayre points to the “hook-up
culture” as a major cause of the
miscommunication which can
lead to sexual assault.

If you are sexually assaulted,
Sayre encourages you to go to the
Health Center. “There is always a
physician and counselor on call.
We can explain all of a student’s
options, attend to medical needs,
and establish a support structure
to start the process of recovery.”
A university counselor will even
stay with the student if he or she
decides to go to the hospital.

For sexual assault survivors
seeking justice or mediation
through the university, there are
several options.

“A formal report can be sub-
mitted through me, a CAIR (Con-
ﬁdential and Impartial Resolution
resource),” said Dr. Sayre, “or
directly to a Designated Ofﬁcer,

such as a dean. CAIRS are won-

student about a range of options
from a formal report to less for-
mal resolutions.”

CAIRs are faculty and staff
members trained to assist students
with problems involving sexual
misconduct. Survivors may also
go to the Student-Faculty Hearing
Board to seek justice. It is a con-
ﬁdential body that may impose a
variety of sanctions. It does not,
however, enforce Virginia law.

Sayre explained that “to be-
gin the process of ﬁling criminal
charges, the police must be con-
tacted. If a student is making a
criminal report immediately fol-
lowing an incident, it would be
best to go to the Health Center so
that a counselor can accompany
the student... for formal evidence
collection.”

As for the future, Sayre would
like to see “our entire community
come together to end sexual vio-
lence on our campus.”

Loar agreed. “Every group
at this university has the power
to. . .alter the kind of environment
that fosters the behavior that leads
to sexual assault.”

He considers Greek participa-
tion vital, “particularly the men,
because they really wield the
greatest inﬂuence on campus, and
thus, they have the greatest power
to effect positive change if they
choose to do so. It’s up to all of us
to do our part.”

Watkins said she agreed
with Comstock, and that’s
why she has been working
to involve students in the

“We went to the Student

Watkins said. “We invited
each of those student lead-

The dangers of Black Friday

Injuries, thefts, general chaos on this busy shopping day are the opposite of the Christmas spirit

By Grace Andrews
C 0 L U M N I S T

oday’s topic is Black
Friday.
For those readers
who are not familiar
with Black Friday, let me ex-
plain.

Black Friday is the day after
Thanksgiving, that Friday when
stores have their huge Christ-
mas sales.

It’s the busiest shopping day
of the year by the number of
people out there.

I usually refuse to shop on
Black Friday out of concern for

- my personal well-being.

I am a bit on the shorter side,
and attempting to outrun the
stampedes with the small ap-
pendages that I call legs could
be disastrous. A

However, this year I ended
up shopping on Nov. 24: Black
Friday.

I was just picking up a few
snacks for my road trip back to
school and not participating in
any sort of Christmas shopping.

While ﬁnishing my shopping

list, I saw a friend of mine with
a cart full of items.

She had a DVD player, a lap-
top, a printer/telephone/fax ma-
chine and a digital camera.

All that she was missing was
a life—size robot that could do
housework for her.

The only problem with her
shopping was that it was around
1:30 a.m.

Wal—Mart’s sale did not start
until 5 a.m., but my friend want-
ed to get there early to beat the
mad dash that would happen at
4:58 a.m. when the sales ofﬁ-
cially begun.

The problem with her being
so prompt was that she had to
wait from 1:30 a.m. until 5 a.m.,
when the Black Friday deals
would begin.

I am not going to lie, the
deals were fabulous, but I do
not know if I would have been
willing to wait that long to get
them.

For a second, I considered
getting a few items and wait-
ing around until ﬁve to get the
deals.

Then I realized that I was

wearing ﬂip-ﬂops instead of
sneakers, thus eliminating my

ability to win a footrace to any

of my favorite items.

Also, I had not done Tae—
Bo in months and would not
be able to defend myself from
anyone who wanted to abduct
my items.

When I asked my friend why
she was there four hours early
to buy her items, she informed
me that Wal-Mart had a limited
number of some of the items.
For example there were only
19 laptops on sale, so if she did
not go early, she would not get
any of the items that she had

County residents
should just deal

College students everywhere throw loud parties. So
why are Rockbridge residents surprised we do, too?

By Cralg Malkmes
COLU M NIST

Rockbridge County is really
getting on my nerves.

Not only have I recently re-
ceived a higher punishment for
a speeding ticket on my way out
to the Mill than my roommate re-
ceived when he got a DUI in St.
Louis, but the whole noise ordi-
nance issue is far beyond absurd.

Granted, it didn’t pass on
Monday, but it’s still up in the air.
Things could still change if we, as
students, don’t show any effort to
decrease the noise.

Many neighbors around the
Pole Houses are furious and can’t
believe that the decision has been
simply put off.

They want to push for a new
noise ordinance so strict that, on
Wednesday nights, parties would
have to be shut down before
many students even go out. That’s
ridiculous.

Some neighbors claim that it
is impossible to sleep and that the
bass from our speakers'is unbear-
ably loud long past midnight.

I know for a fact that the music
is turned off at Pole Three when
it’s supposed to be, so that seems
like a pretty unwarranted com-
plaint to me.

Moreover, the neighbors have
the audacity to label students as a
bunch of rich kids whose parents
will pay for any ﬁnes received for
noise violations.

They further complain that
they have to wake up at 7 a.m. or
8a.m. for work, whereas students
can supposedly sleep for the rest
of the day.

Many students who attend
here do come from wealthy back-
grounds.

However, it is obvious that
thev have not been sooon-fed

Technically, we were here ﬁrst,
so in all actuality, the neighbors
shouldn’t be making demands.

their entire lives. In qualifying
for enrollment to this school, one
must surely have a great deal of
responsibility.

Even the existence of an honor
system shows that students un-
derstand and are willing to face
consequences for irresponsible
behavior.

They don’t neglect to observe
the repercussions of misdemean-
ors simply because they assume
that their parents will pay the ﬁne.
They also must attend classes
that can possibly begin at 8 a.m.,
which many times inﬂuences their
decision to drink the night before.

What the neighbors must real-
ize is simply that this is college,
and these things are going to hap-
pen no matter what school you
live near.

Moving into a college town
means constant interaction with
students. Therefore, the lifestyles
of those students are going to have
a big effect on residential areas.

Citizens moving into Lex-
ington should have already con-
sidered this before purchasing a
home near students. If they have
not, Rockbridge County must
have some pretty devious real es-
tate agents.

College students are going to
drink underage. They are going
to throw obnoxious parties. They
are going to do insane things, like
throw kegs on cars, trip into riv-
ers, fall into ﬁres, or even make
visits to Stonewall Jackson.

Deal with it.

Also, how can neighbors com-
plain about ‘noisy Traveller bus-
es’ keeping them up at night?

Without that system, there
would be much more trafﬁc and
parking issues, as well as the dan-
ger of a huge amount of drunk
driving.

Lexington has grown up
around the school, not the other
way around. Without Washington
& Lee, Lexington would not exist
as a town. The ‘Ruins’ we know
of today include a three-story
building that was built in 1793,
which was recognized as the larg-
est building in the entire county at
the time.

Obviously, the business from
students and faculty at the school
gave merchants and craftsmen a
reason to settle nearby and even-
tually form a town.

Technically, we were here
ﬁrst, so in all actuality, the neigh-
bors shouldn’t be coming into this
town and making demands.

Everyone remembers what it
was like to be a college student
— to drink ﬁve nights a week and
stay up until four in the morning
playing beer pong.

I personally only have two and
a half more years.

The seniors this year just ex-
perienced what will prove to be
their last Christmas Weekend.

So just let the students do their
thing, please.

wanted.

She then told me a story of an
incident that occurred last year.

Apparently, her mother had
gone to Wal-Mart at 5 a.m. and
was almost assaulted by a teen-
ager who wanted an electronic
item that was already gone from
the store’s shelves.

The teen even attempted to
reach into my friend’s mother’s
cart and take the item.

After this, my friend and her
mother wisely decided that they
would just go to the stores of-
fensively early and wait until
the sale hours began.

It is because of problems like

this that Wal-Mart had three
on-duty police ofﬁcers that day
to monitor the doors and walk
around the store.

The saddest part about my
shopping trip to Wal-Mart was
that there were other individuals
who had began shopping early
as well.

They all seemed to be wan-
dering aimlessly in the aisles,
trying to squander four hours.

They looked extremely bored
and restless.

What a shame!

It made me sad to see them
spending their day after Thanks-
giving shopping relentlessly,
especially since I was headed
home to eat more Thanksgiv-
ing food, watch football high-
lights with my brother and go
to sleep.

Later that day, when I arose
from my food-induced coma,
I decided to take a look at the
news and see what Black Friday
chaos had ensued.

As usual, there were stories
of people being trampled, toys
being snatched from the unsus-
pecting hands of parents and

people being robbed outside of
department stores and shopping
centers.

Now if that isn’t the Christ-
mas spirit, I don’t know what is!
(Sarcasm intended.)

Seeing those stories put a
damper on my spirit.

Christmas is not about re-
ceiving gifts or accumulating
every item you want.

It is about giving to others
unselﬁshly and brightening up
someone’s day.

As the world around us be-
comes more chaotic with ﬁnals,
last minute shopping and Christ-
mas list writing, I would like
for you to remember that there
is more to life than getting that
great deal on that new high tech
gadget that you want or buying
those stylish new shoes.

It is about spreading joy.

So whether you do that by
donating some items to the
Union Mission, giving to the
Salvation Army or sponsoring
a child in the area through Na-
bors, remember that there are
countless ways to give this sea-
son and throughout the year.

The Democrats’
Worst nightmare

McCain-Giuliani for president in 2008 now very likely

By Abel Delgado
c o LU M NIST

Just a few days after Election
Day 2006, forward-thinking Re-
publicans were celebrating every-
where.

Tliat’s right, after getting a
good old—fashioned whipping,
Republicans were rejoicing.

Why? Because McCain-Giu-
liani is not only the Democrats’
worst nightmare, the pair is now
looking more likely than ever.

Nov, 8 was a deﬁnite wake-up
call for the Grand Old Party.

The Democrats did not really
win this election, but the Republi-
cans most deﬁnitely lost.

The Republicans did not just
lose, they were completely and
utterly dismembered by the vot-
ing public.

Incumbent Republicans
whose names were linked to the
Jack Abramoﬂ‘ scandal probably
would have lost to the likes of
Walter Mondale.

The Democrats did not take
any chances. They had learned
their lesson and realized that ac-
tual Democrats were not going to
win any elections.

So they nominated people like
Jim Webb, a former Republican
whose only claim to donkey alle-
giance is the fact that he opposed
the Iraq war and that there hap-
pened to be a (D) following his
name on the ballot.

There were a lot of moderate
candidates for the Democrats this
time, and the strategy paid off.
Voters got to vote for Republican-
minded candidates without vot-
ing for the disgraced Republican
Party.

In a way, the Democrats were

The Democrats have a whole two
years to remind the American public
why they kept losing elections.

better at being Republicans this
election than the Republicans
were.

So what’s there to be happy
about if you’re an elephant?

Well, just a few days after the
excommunication of the Repub-
lican majority in Congress, two
extremely prominent, respected,
and moderate Republicans ﬁnally
made their 2008 plans official.

Rudolph Giuliani, America’s
mayor, and John McCain, every-
one’s favorite maverick senator,
both have started what we call
presidential exploratory commit-
tees.

They may not be every con-
servative’s favorite duo, but they
are every Republican’s last hope.
We, and I say we both as a moder-
ate Republican and an American,
need McCain and Giuliani.

We need people who do not
decide their stands on issues
based on party affiliation, but on
personal conscience and public
sentiment.

Both these men represent all
that is great with this country, and
the Democrats know this.

Every poll of expected 2008
presidential candidates shows
that there’s really no way either
of them would be defeated by any
Democratic candidate, especially
Hillary “I should be in jail right
now for Whitewater but my hub-

bie was president so now I’m a
senator” Clinton. Yes, her middle
name is much too long for her to
have a chance.

And who else has a shot for
the Democrats? John Edwards
and Wesley Clark could not even
beat John Kerry. That says some-
thing about their chances in a gen-
eral election. And does the aver-
age voter even know what Evan
Bayh, Bill Richardson, or Tom
Vilsack looks like?

What the Democrats also knew
is that before Nov. 8, the chances
of either McCain or Giuliani win-
ning the Republican nomination
were not too great.

There was far too much dis-
tance between them and the base.
But now the base has no choice.

The Republicans are desperate
enough to pick whoever has the
best chance of beating the Demo-
crats, and the Democrats have a
whole two years to remind the
American public why they kept
losing elections before.

If losing in 2006 means Dem-
ocrats show Americans they’re
a bunch of grade-A do-nothings
and McCain or Giuliani gets the
nomination, then maybe Republi-
cans did not really lose.

Maybe this was the best thing
that could have possibly hap-
pened to the party of Lincoln and
Teddy.

Editor makes
a final request

Outgoing editor asks all students to open up

It’s hard to believe, but it
has been a year since I took
over this 110-year-old publi-
cation that “nobody rea .”

In that time, the newsroom
started working the way a real
newsroom does, on new soft-
ware, on new computers.

But the one thing we still
can’t win is you.

I’ve found that it doesn’t
matter what sits between our
pages. Each week, there are

articles covering students
helping charities and perform-
ing on stage.

We raise issues that affect
student life-——like how the
community feels about you,
or how the laws effect your
nightly activities.

And yet we’re still unpopu-
lar. No one wants to be caught
dead reading the Phi in the
Commons.

That is, except the 500-plus
people who tear the issues off
the stands on Monday nights.

Funny, but despite the
claims otherwise, the news-
paper has been around so long
for a reason.

It’s true that the Phi doesn’t

have a perfect track record for
great journalism; for example,
they used to love to reprint an
incoherent article from the
1960’s explaining how the
Phi got its weird name.

(By the way, “Ring-tum
Phi” used to be a phrase in
some tongue-in—cheek foot-
ball cheer dwnk fans used to
yell out back in 1897.)

It’s also true that the Phi
has done some pretty ground-
breaking work to tie the com-
munity together over the
years.

I’ve always been an ideal-
ist, and it shows in the staff
editorials each week. I would
love to think that in a perfect
world, we could set out to
write stories that you all care
about. I’d love to give you
exactly everything you want
and need.

But I’ve found that the
world is, shockingly, not per-
fect.

For starters, you don’t talk
to us.

On the most important sto-
ries, the ones that scream to
be talked about, you all say

IQ/U“/\

Kat Greene, Editor—in-Chief

“no comment.”

In doing this, you are
handing yourself over to the
rumor mill, where, trust me,
you’ll be butchered for it.

I know why you do it: At
least, if it’s just a rumor, no
one could ever know if it’s '
really true.

But if you want us to reach
you, you have to let us in.

I started my tenure as
editor here with a proposal. I
asked you to stick with me,
believe in me, and the news-
paper, and to wait and see
what we could do.

As I end my time here, I
want to ask another favor:
Open up to us. Realize that
we’re not here to hurt you;
we are you.

But we can’t tell the truth
unless you give us your side.
We can’t reach you unless
you reach out, too.

When I came on as editor,
I told you we would try to
make sure good journalism
started coming out of this
publication.

As I leave, I’d like to ask
you to do your part.

Pope’s fightingwords

Benedict is anti-Islamic quote demands action against suicide bombers

By Cody Beauchamp
C 0 LU M N I ST

The most iconic Christian alive
is telling Islam to put its money
where its mouth is.

Thank God/Allah.

First, before I write another
word, let me roll out the disclaim-
er — this article is not an attack on
the religion of Islam. I understand
and acknowledge that, for the
millions who count themselves
as Muslims, Islam is a legitimate
and very real faith. I know that it
at its core is not violent. Do not
take me to be a blatant racist or
soon-to-be crusading evangelical.

That being said:

On Sept. 12 (note the date,
only one day after the 5th an-
niversaiy of the 9/ ll terrorism
attacks), the leader of the Catho-
lic Church, Pope Benedict XVI,
made a comment during a speech
at the University of Regensburg
in Germany that—to put it deli-
cately—did not go over well with
many Muslims.

In his lecture, Benedict quoted
a passage written by Byzantine
Emperor Manuel II Paleologus,
in which Manuel said, “Show me
just what Muhammad brought
that was new and there you will
ﬁnd things only evil and inhuman,
such as his command to spread by
the sword the faith he preached.”

Ouch.

It is obvious that Muslims
would have reason to be insulted
by anyone who read this state-
ment or made this assertion.

The problem is these terrorists don ’t
understand they are not acting in ac-
cordance with their faith.

This brings up an interesting
question—this statement was
used in a lecture by the man most
representative of all Christians in
the world: the Pope.

Why?

Believe me——it is not that the
pontiff did not know what he was
doing. Joseph Ratzinger (as Bene-
dict was known before adopt-
ing his papal name) is one of the
greatest theological heavyweights
alive today and has been for liter-
ally decades.

He served for years in impor-
tant Church policy-setting bodies,
not the least of which was his stint
under John Paul II as Prefect of
the Congregation for the Doctrine
of the Faith. He was one of John
Paul’s most trusted advisors. He
knows his Muslim/Christian poli-
tics well.

Given that, you will be hard-
pressed to convince me he chose
to use that particular passage be-
cause he either could not ﬁnd a
better one or did not realize that
it basically called Islam an evil,
militant religion.

Why then?

Why would the leader of the

largest Christian body all of a
sudden call Islam a violent faith?

Because Benedict is telling the
faithﬁal Muslims and their leaders
to put their money where their
mouth is and prove that their faith
is not anchored in violence.

Think about it—name the one
unifying thread that runs between
the suicide bombers in Pales-
tine, Iraq, Afghanistan, between
the race riots Europe (especially
France) faced last year and be-
tween the terrorists who killed
innocent people in New York,
Washington D.C., Madrid and
London.

You guessed it—they all claim
to have been acting out of reli-
gious fervor and faithﬁilness.
Faithfulness to Islam.

Now, I understand that these
men (and sometimes women) do
not accurately represent the Is-
lamic faith. I understand they are
extremists. So does Benedict. So
do a large majority of Muslims.

The problem is these terrorists
do not understand they are not
acting in accordance with their
faith.

Benedict called out the ele-

phant in the room when he used a
quote that said Islam is by nature
violent. He expected outraged Is-
lamic leaders to rail against the
idea, to claim that Islam is not
violent.

And now that they have, Bene-
dict gets to ask them to prove it.

It is a masterstroke: as the most
visible Christian leader, Benedict
gets to show the Islamic world
how the Catholic Church has con-
demned past violence by Chris-
tians (the Crusades, anyone?) and
declared itself to be a peace-seek-
ing religion.

That is the church’s modus
operandi for the spread and pro-
tection of itself as a religion.

He gets to say that Christians
are using faith to expand, not for
ﬁghting.

At that point, the outraged
imams and clerics will have to
respond. How can they make the
same claim Benedict can without
decrying the acts of the terrorists
and drawing clear separation be-
tween Islam and the terrorists?

They cannot.

John Paul II helped bring
down communism by supporting
the Polish Solidarity movement,
when Poles rejected communism
as a system that failed them.

Benedict XVI could help
bring down terrorism by forcing
Muslims to reject terrorists as not
acting in accordance with true Is-
lamic faith.

Praise Allah. Thank God. You
choose.

Rules in place regulating
the sorority recruitment process
(rush) at Washington and Lee are
designed to protect the women
thinking about joining sororities,
said Panhellenic Recruitment
Chair Kathryn Heaberg.

Heaberg understands that the
list of rules can oﬂen seem con-
fusing, but said these rules serve
the purpose of protecting both the
sororities and the potential new
sisters.

“There are a lot of pressures
that come with adjusting to col-
lege life,” Heaberg said.

“[Panhellenic] understands
that, and we don’t want to add
to those pressures with sorority
rush.”

Heaberg said the sorority re-
cruitment rules put into place by
Panhellenic also seek to promote
better relations between the ﬁve
sororities at W&L.

As an example of how the
rules seek to take the pressure out
of the rush experience for poten-
tial members, Heaberg pointed
towards rules against involving
men in the recruitment process
and consuming alcohol in the
presence of potential members.

There are also rules requiring
that rush dates must be composed
of certain ratios of sisters to po-
tential members.

Heaberg said that rush dates
where potential members are
outnumbered by sisters would be
understandably intimidating ex-
periences for the potential mem-
bers, so Panhellenic has rules that
ensure the dates never have more
sisters than potential recruits.

Heaberg said she believes that
if alcohol were shared by sorority
sisters and potential members, it
would make the potential mem-
bers feel strongly pressured to
drink.

“When you’re looking at one
house, and there are sisters from
that house encouraging you to
drink with them, you would feel
a greater pressure to drink, even
if you didn’t really want to,” Hea-
berg said.

Heaberg also said Panhellenic
has rules during formal recruit-
ment that prevent both potential
members and sisters from drink-
ing. She said the rules are simi-
lar to the requirements that are
in place during the informal rush
events of Fall term.

“Plus,” Heaberg said, “Alco-
hol and drinking shouldn’t really
be the focus of that week,”

When asked why potential
members were forbidden from
being in any of the sorority hous-
es except during special events,
Heaberg pointed to the privileges
that come from being in a soror-
ity.

“It’s deﬁnitely different from

Happy Holidays
' from the Ring-Tum Phi.

 The Best Newspaper that Comes Out on Monday

the fratemities,” Heaberg said
about having closed houses.

“But that’s a privilege that
comes with members to the soror-
ity—getting to go in the house.”

Heaberg said that potential
members are barred from Greek
fratemity-sorority mixers because
membership in a house should
carry some perks and privileges.

“You want to have something
to look forward to,” Heaberg
said.

Heaberg also said that mix-
ers inherently have an element
of men--the fraternity members-
-promoting a sorority above the
others by association.

“We deﬁnitely seek to have a
level playing ﬁeld with all the so-
rorities,” Heaberg said.

She also said it is this desire
to foster and maintain good in-
ter-house relations that also is the
reason behind rules against “dirty
rush” and buying items for poten-
tial members.

“The recruitment process has
the potential to really create bad
feelings between the sororities,”
Heaberg said.

“We want to have rules that
make sure the process creates as
little tension between the sorori-
ties as possible.”

Heaberg reinforced the fact
that once Fall term ends, the for-
mal rush process begins for po-
tential members.

Among the things potential

Rules for formal recruitment week

- potential members are not allowed in the sorority
house with the exception of Greek events and rush

week

- no contact is permitted between active and
potential members during Winter break and rush

week

- drinking is discouraged for potential members

during formal rush week

members can expect to see are
the implementation of no-contact
rules between sisters and potential
members and formal rush week
invitations to come spend time
around sisters in their respective
houses.

“The no contact is there to
take away some of the pressures
surrounding the decision-making
that potential members have to
do,” Heaberg said.

“Sororities will get their allot-
ted time with the evening meet-
ings, but after that it’s a time for
the potential members to work on
their decisions without pressure.”

Heaberg said that potential
members can expect to receive
invitations from all the sorority
houses, after which the potential
members and the sororities both
list their preferences for member-

ship.

After that, a weeklong elimi-
nation process starts for both the
potential members and the sorori-
ties, leading up to the extension
of bids to potential members on
the Friday of formal rush week
around 5 p.m.

After formal bids are distrib-
uted, both the sororities and fra-
ternities welcome their new mem-
bers with tear night celebrations.

Heaberg encourages potential
members with any questions to
talk to their Rho Gammas, who
are sisters who volunteered to
“de-aﬁiliate” from their sorority
for the term in order to provide
impartial advice and guidance to
potential members.

Heaberg said: “Ultimately, we
want to make this entire process
as enjoyable as possible.”

Ballers fall to foes

Generals drop two close decisiqns over the weekend

By Mlke Fahey
sPoRTs EDITOR

After setting a school record
for most points scored in a single
game, the Washington and Lee
women’s basketball team lost two
close games this past weekend
against ODAC opponents.

The Generals got off to a great
start on their season, capturing the
Swarthmore Tip-Off Classic and
an incredible win over Hollins.
Unfortunately, the Generals fell
at the hands of Randolph-Macon
and Virginia Wesleyan.

Sophomore Kara Nadeau said,
“I was really proud of us for win-
ning the tip-off tournament, and
even though our last two games
were losses, 1 think we are gain-
ing good experience for later on
in the season.”

Virginia Wesleyan defeated
the Generals 66-54 in ODAC ac-
tion on Saturday afternoon. The
Generals jumped out to an 11-1
lead just 3:29 into the game, but
the Marlins came right back with
a 10-0 run to even the game at
11-11 with 13:37 left in the ﬁrst
half. The game was a back-and-
forth contest for several minutes
before Virginia Wesleyan closed
the ﬁrst half with an 11-3 run for
a 33-25 lead at the break. W&L
battled back in the second half to
tie the game at 46-46 on a three-
point play by sophomore forward
Kara Nadeau with 8:22 left in the
game. However, after the Marlins
posted an 8-0 run over the next
2:02 the Generals had no answer.

The Generals were led by se-
nior center Jessica Hunsinger,
who notched 16 points and pulled
in eight rebounds. Nadeau added
13 points and seven boards.

into conference play is the best
since the 2002-2003 season, when
the Generals started off 3-1, only
to drop 14 of their next 16 games
en route to an 8-17 season.

Fourth-year Head Coach
Adam Hutchinson notes that the
initial successes are due in part
to the teams base of juniors and
seniors.

“I think a lot of it can be at-
tributed to carry over,” Hutchin-
son said.

On Friday evening, the Gen-
erals recovered from an 11-point
halftime deﬁcit to pull within one
point in the ﬁnal minutes of the
game. They could not pull off a
road win, however, losing 66-64
to Randolph-Macon in an ODAC
battle.

W&L was led by sopho-
more guard Bethany Ridenhour,
who tied a career-high with 16
points and added six assists,
four rebounds and three steals.
Krouchick notched 14 points and
eight boards, and Hunsinger tal-
lied seven points, a game-high 11
rebounds and ﬁve blocks.

Earlier in the week, the Gener-
als set a school record for points
scored and largest margin of vic-
tory with a 90-26 win over Hol-
lins on their home court.

The Generals held Hollins
scoreless for the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes
of play and had a 49-12 lead at the
break. The 64-point victory sur-
passed the forrner record of 55 set
against Mary Baldwin in 1998,
while the 90 points eclipsed the
89 points scored against Emory &
Henry last season.

Ridenhour had 16 points,
while ﬁve Generals were in dou-
ble ﬁgures. Krouchick notched 15
points, while junior guard Wolff
added a career-high 14 markers.
Junior forward Amanda Kane
scored 12 points and Hunsinger
chipped in 11 points, while pull-
ing down eight rebounds. Senior
guard Sarah Otey contributed a
career-high 10 assists.

The W&L women’s basketball
team ‘ ‘claimed-its ‘ﬁrst’ in-sea'son
tournament title since the 1997-
98 season with a 52-45 win over
Swarthmore in the championship
game of the Swarthmore Tip-Off

Tournament. -

Krouchick scored 18 points
in the championship game and
notched six rebounds en route to
being named tournament MVP.
She was joined on the all-touma-
ment team by Ridenhour.

The Generals had opened their
2006-07 campaign with a 62-24
victory over the City College of
New York.

Despite the recent losses, the
team is rebounding well. As soph-
omore Bethany Ridenhour said,
“We are learning quickly and re-
alizing that we can be a dominant
team in the ODACs this year and
perhaps even win the league. “

The Generals have put in long

hours on the court in the pre- ‘

season, preparing for a run at the
ODAC championship. It is this
drive and determination that have
contributed to the team’s great
start.

Nadeau said, “I think we all
worked really hard in the off-sea-
son and have been practicing hard
every practice.”

Backed by a strong group of
returning stars, the Generals al-
ready have a proven court chem-
istry that will be very beneﬁcial to
them as the season draws on.

“We are probably the hardest
working team in the conference
and we are looking to prove it,”
Ridenhour said. “Everyone on
the team has improved their game
and stepped it up so that our team
is as deep as can be.”

As the team continue its quest
for an ODAC title, Nadeau would
like to see the student body come
out and support the team. “I am
expecting all of my friends to
come to the games and cheer and
hold up signs,” she said.

drops the ball

“In the past, we had to rely a
lot on freshmen for a good num-
ber of minutes, and that’s not the
case this year.”

On Saturday the men faced off
with Randolph-Macon, a team the
Generals have not beaten since
1977. Though Bienemann, with
some help from F emi Kusimo
kept the Generals close, Ran-
dolph-Macon pulled away in the
ﬁnal minutes for a 63-58 victory.

Virginia Wesleyan trounced

the Generals 74-50, outrebound-
ing W&L by a 43-17 margin.

“We know we can play with
these teams,” said Hutchinson,
citing close losses last year to
Randolph-Macon and other top
conference foes.

Added freshman forward John
Twomey, “The next three games
(against Randolph-Macon, Va.
Wesleyan, and Eastern Menno-
nite) will really show us how far
we’ve come as a team.”

 Generals fall to Wilkes

W&L suffers tough 42-0 loss in
ﬁrst round of the NCAA tourney

By Brlan Devlne
smrr warren

Washington and Lee Generals
football had its best season in 25
years this fall, winning the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
outright and reaching the post-
season for the first time since
1951.

Their success in the regular
season did not carry over to the
playoffs, however, as the Gener-
als fell by a score of 42-0 to the
Wilkes University Colonels in
Wilkes-Barre, Pa.

The Colonels held every ad-
vantage on paper coming into the
game and they proved themselves
worthy of their top seed in the
East Region.

Led by a swarming defense
that forced three W&L turnovers,
the Colonels jumped to a 21-point
ﬁrst quarter lead and never looked
back. Four of Wilkes’ ﬁrst ﬁve
drives ended in touchdowns.

The Generals were hurt by the
early turnovers.

On the game’s third play,
W&L freshman quarterback R.J.
Vamer was intercepted by Bryan

. throw f<_>r..a. tczuchdoy/.n,..v. ... ». .r

The Generals’ second drive
faired no better, as sophomore
tailback Stuart Sitterson fumbled
a pass reception on his own 30-
yard line that was recovered by

the Colonels’ John Darrah, giv-
ing the home side excellent ﬁeld
position.

Capitalizing on the Gener-
als’ second mistake of the quar-
ter, Wilkes tailback Jason Nabba
scored to make it 14-0 with only
ﬁve minutes gone off the clock.

Even without the visitors’ mis-
takes, the undefeated Wilkes of-
fense easily outgunned its W&L
counterpart.

Led by quarterback Al Karaffa
and tailback Tom Andreopolous,
the Colonels amassed 387 yards
to the Generals’ 141.

The Generals frequently failed
to convert on third down. Doug
Sweeney punted eight times and
Ben Long missed two ﬁeld goals.

The Generals’ defense, so ef-
fective against regular season
ODAC competition, could not
contain Andreopolous and the
Wilkes offense.

Rotating three running backs
throughout the game, Wilkes
wore down the W&L defense.

Andreopolous, the team’s
usual starter, had 169 yards on 15
carries. Freshman fullback Drew
Letcavage added 55 yards on 16
canies, and short-yardage _ spe-
cialist_l}Iabha..chalked.up ;40 yards
and two touchdowns.

The mistake-ﬁlled game was
a disappointing end to the best
football season in W&L’s recent
history.

Patiently waiting
for the big honors

Jeter and Manning continue to seek important hardware
despite receiving recognition in other ways for their careers

By Adam Lewls
COLUMNIST

Dan Marino, Karl Malone,‘

Tony Gwynn.

Hearing these three names
mentioned in the same sentence
can imply only one thing: great
players who retired without win-
ning a champi-
onship.

These ath-
lete's compiled
some of the
best statisti-
cal careers in
recent history.
Yet when sports
fans and ana-
lysts discuss the greatest players
of all time in football, basketball,
and baseball, they oﬁen leave
these names out for the sole rea-
son that their hands lack jewelry.

Having held the same discus-
sion on numerous occasions, I
understand the logic. At the end
of the day (or season for that mat-
ter), only one thing matters--the

 

championship, not the regular

season stats. . .

But let me reverse that argu-
ment, coming to the defense of
players like Peyton Manning and
Alex Rodriguez, who could very
well join the likes of the previ-
ously mentioned athletes.

This past week, the Minne-
sota Twins’ Justin Momeau was

awarded American League’s

M.V.P., to the dismay of Derek

Jeter, who was a close second.
Over the past decade, Jeter has

- been regarded as one of the most

elite athletes in the four major
sports, and undoubtedly one of
the best postseason players in his-
tory, (in baseball terms, he is of-

ten thought of as “clutch”).

As a ﬁfth year player in 2000,
he already boasted four rings, ty-
ing him with the great Lisa Marie
Presley.

But equally as notable is the

[fact that he still remains lacking

an M.V.P. award, and that is the
foundation of my argument.

I am in no way downplaying

his tremendous postseason hero-
ics and statistics. But to me, it is
only fair to attribute the champi-
onships he won to the rest of his
team as well, which goes without
saying, as they are indeed the
Yankees.
’ ‘ The same goes for players like
Tom Brady. He may have won
three Super Bowls, but his stats
are far inferior to Peyton Man-
ning. Until Manning gets his ring,
Brady will be regarded by most as
a better quarterback.

If you look at the teams of
Jeter and Brady, certain things be-
come clear.

Jeter’s Yankees, under the
ownership of George Stein-
brenner, spent by far the most

money in baseball since the be-
ginning of their dynasty in 1996,
so obviously Jeter had plenty of
help.

In contrast, someone like Alex
Rodriguez has won two M.V.P.
awards, yet will continued to be
criticized until hevwins a champi-
onship. ,

Not to undermine the postsea-
son performances of Tom Brady,
but in each of his three Super
Bowl seasons, he was equipped
with one of the league’s best de-
fenses. The defensive unit played
more than a little role in the Patri-
ots’ dominance.

Manning, on the other hand,
simply put up record-setting num-
bers during the regular season;
however, he was not fortunate
enough to have such a powerful
defense.

But my object is not to defend
Manning, nor is it to downplay
J eter and Brady.

Rather, I want to point out that
championships in no way deﬁne a
player’s ability, and furthermore,
they carry way too much weight
in the argument of the “bests” in
the various sports.

Just because a player is not sur-
rounded by championship,-worthy
talent should not immediately re-
move him from the argument,
and in my mind, as well as that of
“Borat,” his career should still be
considered a “great success!”

Junior comerback Mark Snod-
dy, who set a new school record
with 17 career interceptions in
only three years, was named one
of two ﬁnalists for the small-col-
lege Dudley Award, given to the

football player in Virginia.

Vamer was named ODAC
rookie of the year and ﬁnished the

ing, despite only playing eight

Generals lose in Elite 8 after knocking oﬂ top seed

By Mike Huntress
STAFF warren

Washington and Lee’s wom-
en’s soccer team got knocked
out of the NCAA Division III
quarterﬁnals Nov. 19 in a fash-
ion emblematic of how they’ve
played all season.

They recorded a shutout.

It took penalty kicks to de-
cide a winner, with both teams
playing stalwart defense.

Ranked 24th nationally, the
Generals loss came at the hands
of 19th ranked Virginia Wes-
leyan.

Goalkeeper Kiki Moreo was
solid as usual, turning back
several scoring opportunities
in a game where it was clear a
single goal would be the decid-
ing factor.

Sophomore forward Anne
Van Devender nearly put one
away for the Generals on a one
time shot from ten yards out,
but her attempt sailed harm-
lessly over the bar. Penalties
went 4-3, Virginia Wesleyan’s
way to send the Generals’ home
packing.

The Generals troubles with
Virginia Wesleyan were well-
documented this season, as the
two teams had gone up against
one another twice already.

Back on Sept. 23, Wesleyan
snapped the Generals ﬁve-game
winning streak to start the sea-
son. That game ended in a 0-0
draw after two overtimes.

On Nov. 1 the Generals

yielded their second goal of the
season to Wesleyan and lost 1-0,
knocking them out of the ODAC
tournament.

Wesleyan dominated early,
and after their goal the two team’s
settled into a virtual stalemate.

It seemed ﬁtting, although
frustrating, that the only team
who had previously been able to
beat the Generals should reappear
in the NCAA tournament to send
them home packing.

The penalty-kick ending
capped off what was a remarkable
season for the Generals. Includ-
ing their NCAA performance,
they were 19-1-3, setting a school
record for victories and setting a
new program record for allowing
only three goals the entire season,
after starting the season with ﬁf-
teen straight shutouts.

The Generals, despite losing
in the ODAC tournament, had the
best regular season record and en-
tered that ODAC tournament with
the top seed.

The Generals had an amaz-
ing run in the NCAA tournament,
knocking off top-seed Washing-
ton University in St. Louis in the
Sweet 16 of the tournament, 2-1.
The Generals were led by goals
from junior Martha Caulkins
and sophomore Erica Giordano.
Caulkins was a force for the Gen-
erals offense, and Moreo contin-
ued her stellar season in goal for
W&L.

On an individual level it was
also a special season. Head Coach
Neil Cunningham was named

ODAC Coach of the Year, and the
Generals had nine players recog-
nized by on the All-ODAC team.

Sophomore sensation Van De-
vender, senior captain Maggie
Megear, and junior captain Haley
Bunting were named as ﬁrst-team
All-ODAC players.

Freshman Maggie Sutherland,
seniors Anne Wiltshire and Jamie
Dorsey, and sophomores Marisa
Van Brunt and Moreo received
All-ODAC Second Team honors.
Freshman Roz Klann received an
Honorable Mention.

Four players were also recog-
nized by the All-South Region
team. Van Devender was named
to the First Team, while Wilshire,
Megear, and Moreo were all
named to the second team. Three
Generals were recognized by the
Academic All-District team. Ju-
nior Martha Caulkins was given
First Team accolades, while soph-
omore Kate Corr and Van Dev-
ender were selected to be on the
Second Team.

Of the nine players recognized
by the All-ODAC team, six of
them return for what should be a
very formidable team next year.

With eight total seniors leav-
ing after this year, there will be
gaps to ﬁll, but much of that will
be made up by the increased ma-
turity of this years’ strong sopho-
more and freshman classes.

The Generals ended the season
ranked tenth overall in a national
poll, and set a school record for
the best showing by the team in
the NCAA tournament.

Generals drop
two tough ODAC
games over the

weekend

STAFF wnmsn

Just four games into the season,
the Washington and Lee men’s
basketball team was already ex-
ceeding preseason expectations.

Off to their fastest start since
2002, the Generals had taken ad-
vantage of a veteran roster and
have won three out of their ﬁrst
four non-conference games, in-
cluding a run to the ﬁnal round of
the W&L Men’s Basketball Tip-
off Tournament here in Lexing-
ton. It remains to be seen if the
momentum of the early season
can carry over into conference
play.

After falling to Division I VMI
in an exhibition opener, W&L
hosted three other schools in the
W&L Men’s Basketball Tip-off,
Tournament. The Generals drew
Denison in the ﬁrst round, and,
aided by a 21-5 run in the second
half, dispatched the Big Red by a
score of 82-71.

Senior guard Chris Halkitis
led W&L with 15 points, in a

game where 10 different Generals '

scored.

W&L then moved onto the
ﬁnals to face Averett College.
Averett relied on near-perfect
shooting and led by 23-point at
halftime.

The Cougars went 15-17 from
inside the three-point arc in the
ﬁrst half and didn’t miss a shot
from inside the arc until one min-
ute before halftime.

Despite 16 points from sopho- .

more guard Isaiah Goodman, the
Generals could not close this half-
time deﬁcit, and took their ﬁrst
loss of the season by a score of 79-
56. Goodman and junior forward
Greg Bienemann were named to
the all-toumament team.

After the disappointing ﬁnish
to their home tournament, W&L
looked to rebound on the road
against Dickinson College. Tak-

Sweet sets two school records and qualiﬁes for NCAA championships

By Lara Jordan
STAFF WRITER

The men’s and women’s swim-
ming teams continue the season
with strong ﬁnishes, school re-
cords and individual cuts to qual-
ify for the NCAA meet.

The women’s swimming team
ﬁnished fourth out of 11 teams at
the Franklin & Marshall Invita-
tional on Sunday Dec. 3.

One technique that the team
has used to achieve a strong re-
cord is specialized practices.

“We have training speciﬁcally
with what you compete in,” said
freshman Jenna Worsham. “For
example, I swim IM, so practices
are designed speciﬁcally for that
race, targeting what you need.”

Also, the team has been very
focused on nutrition this year.

“Our coach handed out pam-
phlets on nutrition,” said fresh-
man Annaria Nardone.

“We have to learn how to keep
hydrated, eat a lot of protein, and
when to eat throughout the day,”

she said.

The teams will also be going
on a training trip to Florida after
Christmas, where they will be
coached by Olympic swimmers
and have meets twice a day.

“For the training trip, we have
a few Olympians come coach us
and help us with our technique,”
said Worsham. “We come back
in really good shape with a lot of
momentum to send us through the
rest of the season.”

The Washington and Lee men’s
swimming team ﬁnished fourth at
the NIKE Open, hosted by Ken-
yon College on Dec. 2. The men
broke three school records and
made ﬁve NCAA cuts.

One reason for the men’s
strong ﬁnishes is improvement
with their breaststroke and butter-
ﬂy swimmers.

“We are zoned in on every
race and really getting some good
experience early in the season,”
said Alex Sweet, who set a new
school record in the 100 freestyle.
“Additionally, our breaststrokers

and ﬂyers are really stepping up
this year, and it looks as if we are
going to have a great year in that
department.”

Sweet was the feel-good story
of the weekend. Aﬁer his house
burned down on Wednesday
monring, Sweet rose to the occa-
sion and qualiﬁed for the NCAA
national championships.

With 10 freshmen, the seniors
have made an effort to take new
members under their wing and
to take full advantage of a large
team.

“We have a huge freshmen

class, but also have a much big-
ger senior class than last year,”
said Sweet. “We have the expe-
rienced swimmers who can help
the freshmen make the necessary
adjustments. This will become in-
creasingly more important as con-
ference and nationals approach.”

The goal of the women’s team
is to win ODACS.

“We are hoping for another win
at the ODACS,” said Worsham.
“And we want to beat our biggest
rival--Randolph Macon Woman’s
College. We can deﬁnitely do it,
but it’s going to take a lot of train-
ing and competitiveness.”

he performs. Margo McClinton, who helped

the General Activities Board plan
the concert, said the incident was
not signiﬁcant enough to prevent
Rhymes’s performance Wednes-
day night.

“Even if you look at the case,
its not that big a deal,” she said.
“He”s coming, and it’s going to be
a great time.”

Rhymes, whose real name is
Trevor Smith, turned himself in
to the Manhattan police on Jan.
4. He was arrested and charged
with misdemeanor assault and
possession of knives and other
weapons.

A former bodyguard has ﬁled a

police report that claims Rhymes
hit him in the face when he came
to collect some money he was
owed.

Rhymes was released on $3 500
bail, but his lawyer told MTV.
com that the arrest was “payback”
for Rhymes ’s refusal to cooperate
with police in an assault case last
August.

In that incident, police accused
Rhymes of kicking a man in the
head for spitting on his car. Police
later found a machete in the back-
seat of Rhymes’s car, but, accord-
ing to Rhymes’s lawyer, it was a
fake machete used in the rapper’s
show.

Rhymes is the one of the big-
gest acts brought in by GAB. Mc-
Clinton said that the group was
“kind of shocked” when they
found out they had booked him.

She said the group felt as
though they were in “a little over
our heads,” but she credits the

students involved with stepping
up to prepare for the big perfor-
mance.

John Allgood, who has led the
operation to book Rhymes, said
that everyone in the committee
has a job to do to pull everything
together.

“There are about a hundred
different things that have to be
done,” he said. “It’s a group ef-
fort.”

The show, which is expected
to sell out Wednesday, has already
received a big response from the
community.

A facebook ﬂyer has helped
get the word out. McClinton said
she has even heard from local
high school students who want to
attend.

McClinton said that the genre
change may be the major attrac-
tion for most students, who, she

oet speaks on King

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

A daylong celebration of Mar-
tin Luther King Jr. ‘s life concludes
tonight with a speech in Lee Cha-
pel by poet Sonia Sanchez.

Sanchez, who has written
more than a dozen books of poet-
ry, will speak at 7:30 p.m. There
will be a candlelight march from
Lee Chapel to Evans Hall after
her speech.

Onyx Vice President Yvonne
Coker said the Martin Luther
King Day planning committee
was impressed with Sanchez‘s ac-
complishments.

“We chose her because of her
reputation within the Civil Rights
Movement,” Coker said, “and her
association with the black arts
movement.”

Other members of the selec-
tion committee included Onyx
President Cherrelle Moser, Qui-
ana McKenzie of the Multicul-
tural Student Association, E”Lon

Cohen of the Joyful Noise gospel
choir, Associate Dean of Students
Tamara Futrell, and English pro-
fessor Laura Brodie.

Sanchez, a native of Birming-

_ ham, Alabama, was born Wilsonia

Benita Driver. She spent nearly
30 years in Harlem before mov-
ing to Philadelphia and teaching
at Temple University from 1976-
1999. She earned the 1985 Amer-
ican Book Award for her book
“homegirls & handgrenades.”

Sanchez has written about sex-
ism, child abuse, and class con-
flicts. She often abandons formal
English and writes in American
black speech patterns.

Coker said Onyx and the MSA
were trying to organize a commu-
nity-oriented event for people of
all ages.

“We want to bring the W&L,
VMI, Lexington and even Rock-
bridge County communities to-
gether,” Coker said.

To further involve the local
community, Brodie worked with

Futrell to organize a birthday
party for Dr. King. The party
was held this aﬁemoon in the
Commons. Brodie advertised the
event in local elementary and pre-
schools.

“The idea for an event came
about from a group of community
members, not just W&L folks,”
Brodie said. “Mostly it was par-
ents wondering what to do with

our kids on this day.”
Though Brodie originally
planned to host a small party, the

event was switched to the Com-
mons at the invitation of Futrell,
who said W&L had both the re-
sources and the space.

“We want young children to
be introduced to Dr. King and the
Civil Rights movement,” Brodie
said.

The party featured games and
face painting organized by W&L
students. It also, of course, had
cake and ice cream.

Cyndi Atkins organized a po-
etry writing contest for middle

Speech by Sonia Sanchez caps a day of celebration and reflection

school students. Atkins is a mem-
ber of the English Department at
Roanoke College and serves as the
artistic director of the local Writ-
ers at Jordan House program.

Brodie said the contest was
aimed at middle school students
because Atkins thought most pro-
grams were focused on elemen-
tary or high school students.

95 area middle school students
entered the contest, and three stu-
dents were selected to read their
poems before Sanchez ’s speech.
Brodie said some local teachers
made the contest part of a class-
room assignment.

This evening’s program will
involve more than just Sanchez ’s
speech and the poetry reading. A
concert by Joyful Noise and Afri-
can drumming are also planned.

Coker said she hopes Sanchez
will share her memories of King.

“We’re interested in hearing
her perspective of the Civil Rights
movements and [how it relates] to
Dr. King’s legacy.”

Saddam Hussein:
dangerous dead

Saddam is trial, execution screw-ups increase instability

By cody Beauchamp
C 0 L U M N l S T

I have a disturbing feeling
that Saddam Hussein had the last
laugh.

Sure, he’s dead, executed by
his enemies for the crime of mass
murder. But in his trial and now
execution, he may have gotten the
death he wanted.

First, there was the travesty of
his trial. To put it bluntly, the new
Iraqi government dropped the ball
lobbed to it by America.

In December 2003, the Pro-
vincial Authority made a poor
decision when they decided to let
the Iraqis try Hussein.

Certainly the people of Iraq de-
served to see the man be brought
to justice. They also deserved to
take part in that justice.

But the judiciary set up by the
new Iraqi government is untested
at best and a downright mess at
worst.

Throughout the trial, legal
scholars and experts worldwide
couldn’t help but agree with
Hussein’s claims that his trial was
fundamentally unjust.

Multiple lawyers were killed
by insurgents attempting to dis-
rupt the trial.

The ﬁrst chief judge, Rizgar

interference.

More lawyers were killed.

It was the kind of shabby af-
fair that would be declared a mis-
trial and retried had it occurred
in aUnited States court and had
it occurred to anyone not named
Saddam Hussein.

The problem with all of this
isn’t that Hussein never had a
chance of escaping conviction.

The more the execution looked like
a lynching, the more ammunition is
given to the myth of Saddam.

He was a dead man from the
moment the U.S. declared war on
him.

Had he somehow been acquit-
ted of the charges of his “Dujail
Trial,” he would have most assur-
edly been convicted in his “Anfal
Trial.”

If not with that trial, then any
of the numerous other trials that
could have been brought against
him for torturing and killing his
own people for decades.

The problem is, the fact that
the trial wasn’t done on the up-
and-up undermines the Iraqi gov-
emment’s legitimacy.

To many Sunnis, it made the
Shiite-controlled government
look incapable of being just.

This is the kind of sentiment
that will only feed the sectarian
violence that is keeping Iraq from
stability.

The Shiite and Kurd-ﬁlled
Iraqi court system should have
called the trial for what it was—a
farce—and retried Hussein.

They should haveshown the;

world that they weren’t out for re-
venge for the decades of mistreat-
ment under Hussein by taking
their time and doing it right.

But they didn’t.

The execution
botched.

If you have the stomach, check
out the videos of Hussein’s hang-
ing.

And with the exception of one
outburst (in which he cursed the
“Persians,” his Iranian enemies
from the Iraqflran War), Hussein,
to his credit, looked digniﬁed and
calm.

The aura he maintained
throughout the affair actually—
somewhat disturbingly—evokes
sympathy.

If you could somehow Photo-
shop the face of a black man onto
Hussein’s, you would think the
video was of a K lynching.

For shame.

The more the execution looked
like a lynching, the more ammu-
nition is given to the myth of Sad-
dam Hussein.

There is a dangerous amount
of room to view him as a martyr,
something that is dangerous for
Iraq’s stability.

Surmi extremists can now

Hussein most likely believed
until his last moment alive that he

than to see the new Iraqi govern-

Thanks to the botched job, the

Rush: Thank goodness it’s

Everyone hates it, and now

In the past week, people
have pushed themselves to
the limit both physically and
emotionally, just to make this
momentous Greek event go

by the way, it never does-
and for what?

Some people risked it all,
really putting themselves out

The week from

With bids and balls, our identities are forged

People turned their backs

took it personally when their

The organizations are

And to what does all of this
stress, all of this lost sleep and
all of this pain amount?

A social structure that ex-
cludes more than it includes,
divides more than it unites
and, in general, perpetuates
stereotypes so much that the
casual use of them is accept-
able, if not expected, in every-
day conversation.

It has become so imprinted
firm-t.1_1_.<=.,.,.i.<l,<:i1,t,i_ty.,9t”. the,,school
and its students that its de-
struction is unthinkable—we
can’t live without it. We for-
get, when we arrive on cam-
pus, everything we’ve ever
learned about accepting and

appreciating our differences.

We put up boundaries
that determine where we will
eat lunch, throw parties, and
sleep.

We decide, in the ﬁrst year
of college, with whom we will
be friends for the rest of our
college careers. This doesn’t
mean that we don’t associ-
ate with people outside of
our Greek organizations, or
that we wouldn’t have been
friends with our pledge class-
es anyway. It just means that
we have resigned ourselves to
a group, an identity, to which
we will be tied for four years
or more.

In our search for self, we
become so desperate to ﬁnd
a categorical identity that we
assign ourselves to a group,
regardless of its reputation.
And in one tumultuous week,
we sift through ideas about
who we think we are and how
we want to be identiﬁed and
then make a decision.

We are deﬁned, in many
ways, by this one week. Thank
goodness it’s over.

Why is d-hall separated by race, origin, gender: and Greek organization?

have three distinct choices,

and I’m not. talking about
what I eat. I’m talking about
who I eat with. Why?

I could eat at what my friend
calls the “black community
table.” I could eat with my “in-
ternational friends,” usually in
the back table on the stage. I
could eat with one of the many
predominately or entirely white
cliques that I happen to be
friends with.

Of course this is not always
the case. Some people in these
groups I just mentioned regular-
ly eat with people from the other
groups, but that’s an exception,
not the rule. Why?

Does this seem ﬁne to every-
one else? It doesn’t to me. I was
just able to divide the dinning
hall by race.

That’s what they called seg-
regation.

Before a preacher by the

name of King came around,
dining halls like ours were seg-
regated, and it was condoned by
the government. Now we have
what I call “chosen segrega-
tion.”

Now it’s us, the people, who
choose to segregate ourselves.
I’m not blaming the white stu-
dents. I’m not blaming the black
students. I just want to know
why.

Why is it that I have to
choose?

They have told me it’s like
this everywhere. My college
friends say their high schools
were “diverse” but students
tended to keep to “their own
kind.” It’s not like this every-

 

where though. That wasn’t the
case where I’m from.

Back home, my choice of
who I ate with had nothing to
do with what someone looked
like or where they were from.
My lunch table back then had
people with every skin pigment
known to man.

I’m not going to pretend we
were colorblind. There were
race jokes, but we were com-
fortable enough to have them
without getting offended.

We proved we weren’t racist
by embracing our differences
and still not letting them divide
us. We were all proud of who
we were and sure enough of
ourselves to not need to be sur-
round by people who were just
like us.

That’s not the case here, and
I don’t get why. Why do I see
plenty of tables of just guys and
plenty of just girls, as if we were
in kindergarten and we thought
the other sex had cooties?

Why do I rarely see people
of different Greek organizations
sit together? Why is that I could
say there is such thing as a black
table and a white table?

I don’t have answers, just
questions. I expect we all need
to come up with the answers.

‘Seriously, what was the point
of the civil rights movement?
What’s the point in W&L be-
coming co—ed if we still treat
the other sex completely differ-
ently? What’s the point in W&L
recruiting minority students if
they’re going to be segregated,
or segregate themselves?

Why do we bother? Does it
just look nice to say we have
women, we have minorities,
we have international students,
even if everyone just “sticks to
their own kind?”

There is a reason why W&L
wants to be diverse. Being ex-
posed to diversity makes us
more culturally aware, more
well-rounded, and, yes, more
intelligent.

It not only gives us a sense of
what’s around us but of who we
truly are.

Boundaries like segregation
don’t keep other people out.
They fence you in. Do we really
want to be fenced?

I hear my class is doing a bet-
ter job of desegregating. From
what I’ve seen, freshman tables
aren’t as monochromatic as the
rest. So we have hope.

So I want everyone who
reads this, everyone who has the
same problem I do with chosen
segregation, to sit at a table you
wouldn’t normally sit at next
time you got to d-hall. Why
not?

THE RING-TUM PHI 0 3

 

Leaders serve nation

Bonner students pledge to complete 900 hours of community service for partial tuition scholarship

By Jessica Shaw
ARTS 3. LIFE EDITOR

A number of Washington and
Lee students actively participate
each semester in service efforts
to better the surrounding commu-
nity. Even the most ambitious stu-
dent, however, struggles balanc-
ing studies, social life, athletics,
work and community service.

A Bonner Leader program has
been implemented on campus to
aid those ambitious students who
have a passion for bettering the
world.

Currently, there are 22 W&L
Bonner Leaders on this campus
who have committed themselves
to two full years of service. These
students underwent a rigorous
application process and have
pledged to complete 900 hours of
volunteer work in these two years.
On December, 13 new Bonner
Leaders were appointed.

“I am very busy, but I was very
attracted to the aspect and the idea
that Bonner Leaders were about
individuals who wanted to take
the time out of their schedules to
better themselves through serving
others,” sophomore Grace An-
drews said.

Because of the time com-
mitment, a scholarship has been
awarded to these individuals to
replace time that may have been
dedicated to a part-t‘i_1_jr.'pi_e: job.;A1c‘-

‘cording to Bonner Leader Pro-

gram Director Dr. Sandra Hays-
lette, W&L provides $2000, and
AmeriCorps, the non-proﬁt or-
ganization that helps fund tuition
scholarships, gives each student
$2300 after the completion of the
900 hours.

“It’s often hard for students
who have a lot of other obliga-
tions in their schedule to ﬁnd time
for service, especially if they are
involved in work study,” Hays-
lette said.

“A strong, steady commit to
service where you’re at the same
agency for a long haul is so trans-
formative.”

Bonner Leaders have a lot of
freedom in choosing the type of
organization they want to volun-
teer with. Andrews said she wants
to take advantage of her foreign
language skills when she is doing
service.

“I want to work somewhere

where I could utilize my Span-
ish,” she said. “I really want to
work with immigrants and refu-
gees. That’s a way to have a glob-
al focus but work domestically. I
want to specialize in the women
and children as well, because
those are the immigrants who
usually come.”

Sophomore Aisha Davis said
she would also like to assist wom-
en and children.

“I would like to help women
and children because as a whole,
they seem to have the least amount
of assistance,” Davis said. “I feel
like women and children have a
harder time with securing a stable
1ife.”

Davis also said she had an in-
terest in working with the elderly.

“I think that as a society,
Americans mistreat their elderly,”
she said. “If we can’t organize
ourselves together to help out
people who have put their lives
into this country, I don’t really
see too bright of a future for our
country.” '

According to Hayslette, even
though the interview process is
quite strenuous, the variety of tal-
ents and personalities that a Bon-
ner Leader displays are diverse.

“I think we are looking for
people who seem ready for chal-
lenge, who seem ready to take on
that project of ﬁnding a way to
make ‘a lasting diﬂ'erenc’e,j’ Hay-“
s1é‘tté'sai'd‘."  ' ' "

“They already caught the bug.
They already know that doing
community service is transforma-
tive for themselves, and it’s ad-
dictive.”

Hayslette emphasized the
diﬁerence between temporary
volunteer work and the Bonner
Leader program. She said that
these students are learning about
themselves and how they can be
forces for permanent change in
society.

“You do help other people,”
Andrews said. “That is the goal,
but I think it’s also about the ex-
periences and what you can leam
from them. I think that a lot of
times, people approach volunteer
work and service in the manner
that they are going to help them,
as if these people need you. But I
think what Bonner is trying to do
is to create a relationship where
both parties need each other.”

The Washington and Lee men’s
swimming team defeated Wing-
ate University on Saturday mom-

Glaston set three pool records
in the event. McGlaston won
the 50 freestyle in a time of
21.33, setting a pool record. He
also set a pool record in the 100
freestyle with a time of 48.01.
McGlaston teamed with seniors
Ben Accinelli and Max Pike,
and sophomore Chris Diebold
in setting a pool-record time of
1 229.26. Senior Mike Ginder won
the 100 backstroke in a pool-re-
cord time of 53.52. Ginder also
captured the 200 back in a time
of 1:57.92. Ginder led off the
other victorious 200 free relay
time, teaming with freshmen Josh
Gonzalez and Brandon Bamds
and sophomore Brett Tatman.
Ginder, McGlaston, Hayes, and
Accinelli combined to place sec-
ond in the 200 yard medley relay
for the Generals. The Generals
had a one, two, three sweep in

The Washington and Lee wom-

a tough loss at the hands of
Wingate University on Saturday.
The Generals lost by a score of
168-93. Washington and Lee
was paced by sophomore Lind-
sey Strachan, who captured the
200 yard backstroke in a time of
2:12:48. Strachan then teamed
with sophomore Susan Mahoney,
junior Amy Roberson, and fresh-
man Jenna Worsham for a second

ley relay in a time of 1:55.68.
Strachan also placed second

While most Washington &
Lee students spent their holiday
breaks far from campus, the Gen-
erals men’s basketball team wel-
comed three teams to the Warner
Center for the W&L Tournament.
Since winning that event deci-
sively with victories over King’s
Point and Emory, the Generals
have continued their up-and-
down season. They now stand at
7-4, having lost at Roanoke 68-64
on the 6“‘ of January and defeated
Bridgewater 81-74 on the road
one week later.

The team’s recent success has
been lead by junior forward Greg
Bienemann, who has notched
at least 13 points in every game
this year and has lead the team in
scoring and rebounding in their
last ﬁve games. Bienemann was
named Most Valuable Player of

®ToYoTA I moving forward > ® 

the W&L Tournament for his im-
pressive displays against King’s
Point (14 points, 6 rebounds) and
Emory (28 points, 11-of-14 from
the ﬂoor).

Though Bienemann’s per-
formances have stood out, the
team’s play as a whole has risen
since losing to Virginia Wesleyan
on the 3"" of December. Since
then, the Generals are 4-1, with
the game at Roanoke their only
loss. That contest was a back-
and-forth affair, featuring poor
shooting from both teams. Roa-
noke was paced by Curtis Peery,
whose double-double (18 points,
12 rebounds) helped the Maroons
make up a 10-point deﬁcit in the
last four minutes of the ﬁrst half.
The lead continued to change
hands in the second half, until
Roanoke pulled ahead 60-56 with
ninety seconds left. From then,
the Generals were forced to foul
to stop the clock, and Roanoke’s

     

success at the charity stripe (26 of
39) proved decisive.

Against Bridgewater it was the
Generals whose shooting proved
superior. They hit 27 of 41 shots
from the ﬁeld. Again led by Bi-
enemann (26 points, six rebounds)
and fellow junior forward Femi
Kusimo (21 points, a career high),
the Generals never trailed in the
game. The Eagles did make it
close in the fourth quarter but the
Generals, like Roanoke a week
before, were deadly from the foul

line in the clutch, making 9 of 12
in the ﬁnal 1:51 of play to seal the
victory. The win over the Eagles
snapped a 21-game losing streak
in ODAC road games, a string of
losses dating back to February of
2004.

This week the Generals will
try to continue their recent suc-
cess against ODAC opposi-
tion, hosting Emory & Henry on
Wednesday before traveling to the
second-ranked Hampden-Sydney
Tigers at the week’s end.

Wrestlers take third place at W&L Tournament as three Generals win titles in
their weight classes and two wrestlers take lose in the championship match

By Mike Fahey

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team placed third out of
eight teams at the W&L Tourna-
ment held on Saturday at the War-
ner Center.

Muhlenberg won the team title
with 86 points, followed by Johns
Hopkins with 77.5 points, and
W&L with 75.5 points.

The Generals were very
pleased with their performance.
Junior wrestler Anthony Boni-
ello said,“As a team we wrestled
very well. We were only a couple
points behind ﬁrst place. The
competition has deﬁnitely gone
up since last year.”

Three Generals won their
weight classes, while two lost in
the championship match of their

weight classes.

Junior Adam Hockensmith
was very pleased with the team’s
performance at the tournament.
He said, “l thought we wrestled
well. We could have wrestled bet-
ter. Sam Brusca really stepped up.
He was down in his match, and he
came back with a really good chin
whip and pinned his guy.”

Freshman Sam Brusca was
undefeated going 2-0 overall
to win the championship in the
125-pound weight class. Brusca
pinned Muhlenberg’s Mike Te-
nenhaus in the championship
match, 4:28 into the match.

Hockensmith added, “[Brus-
ca’s victory’] was a big win for
the team.”

Junior 165-pounder Anthony
Boniello also went 2-0 overall
to capture the title in his weight

class. Boniello downed Scran-
ton’s Steve Tatum in the ﬁnals of
the 165-pound weight class by a
score of 3-1.

Junior Jesse Sataloff claimed
the championship of the 174-
pound bracket by winning a total
of three matches, including an 11-

match.

The Washington and Lee
women’s basketball team won
two ODAC contests over the
weekend, besting Lynchburg Col-
lege on Friday evening and Ran-
dolph-Macon Women’s College
on Saturday afternoon.

On Friday, the Generals ended
a six-game losing streak with
a 76-68 overtime victory over
Lynchburg College.

Lynchburg had a two point ad-
vantage at halftime, and then held
a 40-32 lead with less then 14

minutes remaining in regulation.
However, the Generals countered
with an 18-2 run over the next
ﬁve minutes to take a 50-42 lead
with a little over nine minutes re-
maining.

W&L held the lead for nearly
the remainder of regulation time,
until Lynchburg nailed a three-
pointer with 10 seconds left to
tie the game at 62-62. The extra
session belonged to the Generals
from the start as senior forward
Jessica Hunsinger gave W&L the
lead on a lay-up just 35 seconds
into overtime. The Generals never

trailed again.

The Generals were paced by

junior forward Kristen Krouchick,
who notched a season-high 20
points and grabbed a career-high
13 rebounds. Sophomore guard
Bethany Ridenhour posted a
career-high 20 points and four
assists, and junior guard Em-
ily Wolff contributed 13 points.
Hunsinger added 10 points, seven
rebounds, four blocks and three
steals.

The Generals then set a school
record when they grabbed 75 re-
bounds, including 41 offensive
boards, in defeating Randolph-
Macon Women’s College 73-49
on Saturday afternoon.

The Generals broke the game
open with a 16-6 run midway
through the ﬁrst quarter which
helped them to take a 10-point
lead into the break. The lead re-
mained at 10 points with a little
over 12 minutes left in the game,
but another W&L run, this time a
21-4 spurt over 10 minutes gave
the Generals a commanding 27-

point lead with two minutes left
in the game.

W&L had a 75-21 overall ad-
vantage in rebounds and had three Q
players record a double-double in
points and rebounds. Freshman
center Kaitlyn Kamp led the way
with career-highs in both points
and rebounds. Kamp notched 15
points and added 13 rebounds.
Krouchick tallied 14 points and
10 boards, while Hunsinger
had 10 points and 13 rebounds.
Ridenhour was a ’fourth Gener-
als to score double ﬁgures as she
accounted for 10 points and six
rebounds.

The Generals have had a great
start to their season, behind the .
strong play of Krouchick and
Hunsinger. They have also had
great contributions from Riden-
hour and Wolff.

Washington and Lee improved
their record to 5-7 overall. Wash-
ington and Lee returns to action
on Tuesday as it hosts Randolph-

the Warner Center.

Former ambassador and Peace Corp director will lead discussions at Institute for Honor

By Wes O’De|l
STAFF WRITER

Ambassador Richard Hol-
brooke will be on campus later
this month to participate in a fo-
rum exploring the extent to which
shared values such as truth, honor
and integrity cross national and
cultural boundaries.

Holbrooke, a former U.S. rep-
resentative to the United Nations,
is considered to be atop contender
for the post of Secretary of State
in any future Democratic admin-
istration.

In addition to serving as di-
rector of the Peace Corps, as a
magazine editor and as an invest-
ment banker, Holbrooke has been
Assistant Secretary of State for

both Europe and Asia. He is the
only person to ever hold such a
position for two different world
regions. He served as an advisor
to Sen. John Kerry’s presidential
campaign in 2004.

Holbrooke also served as
chairman of the 1995 Dayton
peace conference that ended a
three year war in Bosnia and Her-
zegovina.

Sponsoring these discussions
is the Alumni College’s Institute
for Honor. Endowed in 2000 by
the Class of 1960, the Institute’s
mission is “to promote the under-
standing and practice of honor as
an indispensable element of soci-
ety.”

Its seminars enroll a maxi-
mum of 150 alumni, students, and

faculty in a program of lectures,
readings, and small group discus-
sions.

This year’s topic is aimed to-
ward discovering how “differ-
ing nations identify and embrace
common values” and what role
the United States can play in es-
tablishing “a value-based code
of conduct in international rela-
tions.”

Law school Prof. Mark Drum-
bl, Director of the Transnational
Law Institute, is slated to join
Ambassador Holbrooke in lead-
ing the events on Jan. 26-27. He
will be delivering a keynote ad-
dress entitled “Exporting Ameri-
can Norms: Values, Honor, and
Controversy in U.S. Foreign
Policy.”

While he asserts there are
many features of honor common
the world over, Drumbl points out
that “many salutary values are
deeply rooted in local practices
and cultures. The role of inter-
national law, which is my area
of study, is to preserve the local
while building shared values, or-
der, and regulation.”

Drumbl takes particular note
of how America’s own values
have “informed world order,” and
maintains that “it is essential for
[the US] to stick with positive
values in changing times—for us
not to deviate from them even in
difficult periods.”

“The U.S. was central to the
ediﬁcation of institutions such
as the Nuremberg Tribunals and

tive values in changing times--for us not to

the United Nations,” he said, and
now “it is incumbent upon us to
preserve those same honorable
values and apply them, in good
faith, to changing times.”

The Institute for Honor, now
entering its seventh year, has man-
aged to avoid the notice of much
of the student body. A survey con-
ducted of several upperclassmen
found virtually no recognition of

the Institute ’s mission or even its
existence.

The students did agree, how-
ever, that different nations and
cultures can ﬁnd common ground
upon certain shared ideals.

Sophomore .Will Covington
said, “It’s important that we look
at these issues so we can ﬁnd val-
ues in other cultures that reﬂect
our own.”

Speech calls for action

Episcopalian missionary calls upon students to speak out and end the conﬂict in Sudan

By Melissa Caron
smrr warren

everend Lauren Stan-

ley ﬁnished her talk

on bringing hope to

Sudan by calling for
the audience to do one thing—to
be Sudan’s voice.

“We need you to do this,”
Stanely said. “We in Sudan are
expecting you in the United States
to stomp your feet because no one
pays attention to us.”

Stanley, the only full-time
Episcopalian missionary in Su-
dan, was forced to return to the
United States recently because of
escalating tensions in the region,
concluding her I8-month stay.

Robert E. Lee Episcopal
Church and Washington and
Lee’s Young Life brought Stanley
to speak last week about her expe-
riences and how faith affected the
community she was in.

Sudan has experienced internal
conﬂict since the 1970s, in which
ethnic warfare and genocide has
taken place between the north and
south.

Stanley’s speech came one
week after the second anniversary
of signed peace treaty, which she
said did not actually bring peace
to the region.

She described how, at 46-years-
old, she had already seen four

genocides~Cambodia, Rawanda,
Kosovo, and now Darfur—and
still nothing has changed.

“We’re not doing anything,”
Stanley said. “My question for
you is when we say never again,
when do we mean this?”

Stanley described a grim situ-
ation where opposing troops lay
in wait for war on either side of
the community she works and
lives in. She spoke of a govem—
ment that does not allow medi-
cine into the country to help pre-
vent curable but deadly illnesses,
like malaria.

“I don’t think anyone in the
audience wasn’t touched,” said
Burr Datz, Coordinator of Re-
ligious life and the Director
of Leadership Development at
W&L.

According to Stanley, college-
aged students wield immense
power to bring about change
through awareness.

“You are the most tolerant and
accepting generation,” Stanley
said, “and we are depending on
you to teach us.”

This past year, W&L students
have answered this call through
the efforts of organizations such
as Student Association for Inter-
national Learning (SAIL) and
Amnesty International.

Grace Andrews, co-chair of
SAIL, said that Sudan was the or-

pecting you in the United States to stomp your

feet because no one pays attention to us. ”

ganization’s main issue this year
and that they have done a lot to
try to create awareness and raise
money for the relief effort.

“The goal is to get awareness
out there and to let people know
that they are not helpless,” An-
drews said. “They do have pow-
er.”

Last term, the organization
teamed up with Amnesty Inter-
national to put on a talent show
and did a fundraiser called “Say
What Karaoke—Faculty Edition,”
in which people could vote for
the faculty member they wanted
to sing by putting money in cups
labeled with his or her name.

Dean Dawn Watkins was cho-
sen and had to sing “Stand by Your
Man” at halftime of the Parents’
Weekend football game. SAIL
also went through the crowd at
the game accepting donations.

In all, they were able to send
$2,400 to CARE, a non-proﬁt
organization that Andrews de-

scribed as important to SAIL’s
efforts since all the money goes
directly to Sudan.

Andrews said that SAIL has
planned a lot of events for this
term, such as bringing a spoken
word group called “Road to Dar-
fur” to W&L.

SAIL has called on other stu-
dent organizations in part to help
fund the performance and also to
get more people involved in help-
ing the Sudan effort.

“We don’t want to say ‘Hey,
look what SAIL brought’ but rath-
er ‘Look what Washington and
Lee brought’,” Andrews said.

She said groups have been
generous and even willing to help
out through manpower if they did
not have the funds.

Many of SAIL’s efforts have
focused on creating awareness
rather than just asking for dona-
tions. Andrews said that letting
people swipe home donations,
while helpful, does not always

educate the individual about the
cause to which they are giving.

Other possible events include
a letter-writing campaign and an-
other “Say What Karaoke,” this
time with the winner singing at
a basketball game. Andrews said
that SAIL will also be looking
to start a program called “Darfur
Initiative Awareness.” They will
be setting up computers in the
Commons with access to a web-
site that ranks Congressmen on
how they vote for initiatives deal-
ing with Sudan.

Andrews hopes that since it
only takes a couple of minutes to
look up a state, many more people
will become aware of the condi-
tion of Sudanese policy and con-
tact their Congressmen.

Datz agreed that it was this
kind of awareness campaigns that
make a difference.

“When one voice brings in
four more then a ripple becomes a
wave,” Datz said. “Then we have
a tsunami that brings in change.”

Stanley, while stressing the
need for hope within communi-
ties in Sudan, called upon the rest
of the world to help bring change
for the war—tom nation.

“Presidents listen to polls.
Congressmen listen to polls. A
government by the people listens
to the people. You are the people.
Speak.”

- to halt viruses

New Safe Computing Initiative will attempt to stop viruses
and help university protect student eomputersﬁfom damage

By Dane Davis
STAFF WRITER

In an effort to ﬁght the ever-
present threat of computer viruses
and worms, University Comput-
ing has launched a new initiative
to protect students’ computers

Dubbed the Safe Computing
Initiative, the project is a new
plan to stop viruses from spread-
ing once they are in the universi-
ty’s networks.

The plan, which is in its ﬁrst
phase, will require students to
download and install a series of
virus protection software before
connecting to the university net-
work from a residence hall.

The initiative will not imme-
diately be implemented campus-
wide. Instead, the students of Gil-
liam dorm will test out the new
software starting on Jan. 23.

If successful there, the new
software will be required for all
dorms, campus residence halls,
and the sorority houses.

The main reason for this
new initiative is the tremendous
amount of damage each year vi-
ruses and other malware (soft-
ware that is bad for your com-
puter) cause W&L’s and students’
computers.

section of White and Main Streets.
Those stops were added to help
the large numbers of law students
living along or near South Main

Adam Hull, president of the

Despite the small size of the
student body, more than 300 stu-
dents came to the computing help
desk last year to get assistance
with a computer infected by vi-
ruses or malware. Homework
assignments, résumés, personal
data, graduate school and job ap-
plications are all at risk from a
virus infection.

Aside from data deletion, mal-
ware can wreak havoc on one’s
computer in other ways. Popups,
advertisements, and slow-downs
can all result from contamina-
tion.

The infected computer isn’t
the only thing harmed by mal-
ware. Jeff Overholtzer, acting
head of the Technology Integra-
tion Group, said “W&L staff time
[spent] combating the problems
and a loss of network availabil-
ity” are just two symptoms of un-
protected computers.

All of the risks associated
with unprotected computers have
given W&L a special impetus to
secure its networks.

a big impact.”

Hull said law students don’t
like to walk home along Jefferson
and Main Streets because the area
is heavily patrolled by police. He
also said the new Country Ex-
press should help reduce demand
for the dispatch system, hopefully
allowing more law students to use
that service.

The new stops in town should
help keep law students oﬁ the
street, but Lexington Police Chief
Steve Crowder said all students
need to be careful when they wait
for Traveller.

He said students should re-
member that it is against the law
to be drinking at the stops and that
police can stop and enforce pos-
session laws.

While the Country Express
system is just getting started, Ju-
lia Garrett has already noticed a
difference. Garrett lives directly
across the Greenhouse Road from
the driveway up Windfall Hill.
She said the area has been much
quieter after midnight.

“lt’s deﬁnitely helped,”. she
said. “I noticed [Wednesday]
night that the buses went in and
on up the hill.”

Garrett is pleased that the noise
has diminished late at night, but
she is still bothered by trash that
is left around the driveway that
goes up Windfall Hill. In recent
weeks, however, Garrett said the
trash has mostly been unopened
newspapers instead of cups and
beer cans.

Garrett said she and other
neighbors have been pleased with
the continuing response from the
students who live in the area.

“Traveller has to shake its

J FK—like Obama
could heal the US

Moderate goat-herder is son is a threat to the Republicans

By Dylan Merrlll
co LUM NIST

Barack Obama is a god.

By this, I mean to say that he
does have supernatural abilities,
chief amongst them the power of
ﬂight. Republicans, beware!

In fact, there are many reasons
conservatives should fear the al-
mighty senator from Illinois.

First of all, Obama’s charisma,
coupled with his undeniable intel-
ligence, elevates him above the
generally low-set bar of Demo-
cratic mediocrity.

Comparisons to Bill Clinton
are common, and many have even
placed him in JFK territory.

Given the diversity of their
backgrounds, is a Kenyan Jack
Kennedy possible?

Can a black ﬁrst-generation
politician with the middle name
of Hussein possibly penetrate into
the world of Fitzgeralds and Jef-
fersons?

Republicans are skeptical,
hopefully so. Pundits on both
sides of the aisle remain uncon-
vinced that Obama is presidential
enough to run the country effec-
tively." Their main concern is that
he lacks the necessary experience,
having served only a few years in
the U.S. Senate.

The facts, though, support a
different conclusion.

Obama’s time in Congress has
been very productive; the senator
has had success in passing impor-
tant and generally bipartisan leg-
islation. His service on the Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee
especially gives weight to his
experience, regardless of the ac-
cusations that he is a high-proﬁle,

Not so inviting is the prospect of
a torn nation backing the unifying
candidacy of Barack Obama.

media-hungry politician.

Even if Barack Obama is
overly anxious for attention, this
does not discredit his abilities as a
leader and policymaker, because
he is made of stuff more solid
than most.

I saw Obama speak at a Demo-
cratic rally last fall, and his calm
demeanor and patience surprised
the crowd. Much ﬁst-pumping
and Bushwhacking preceded his
speech, but he calmed the bois-
terous audience with thoughtful
words on the future of the coun-
try.

Obama even drew a few boos
from the crowd when he said that
he personally does not dislike the
president, and that he believes
George Bush really does believe
he is helping the country.

Such responsible reﬂection is
uncommon amongst politicians
and is the mark of a true states-
man.

Oh, and did I mention Barack’s
father was a Kenyan goat—herder?
Yeah. Late-night talk show hosts
will become top contributors to
his campaign just for the opportu-
nity to pun on that little tidbit.

We must also recognize that
this junior senator from Illinois
is currently in the center of his 15
minutes of fame. Obama knows
that his quarter hour surge cannot
last another six years; a presiden-

tial exploratory committee was
established this week to gauge
public support and begin ﬁmd-
raising.

Hillary Clinton and the Re-
publicans must be dismayed. Ob-
viously, Hillary feels a threat in
the young senator; his eloquence
and charisma have boosted him
into second place after Clinton,
whose image is quite tarnished,
even among Democrats like me.

This threat to her front-runner
status is deﬁnitely cause for con-
cern in the Clinton camp.

John McCain and Rudy Giu-
liani also feel threatened by

Obama, particularly in his abil- .

ity to get the moderate vote. It’s
safe to assume that both Repub-
licans are not looking forward to
competing against Obama to see
which one can be the purplest.

As a whole, Republicans have
been looking forward to seeing
Hillary’s Dean-a-saurus emotion-
al breakdown as she gets ham-
mered in the polls in 2008.

Not so inviting is the prospect
of a torn nation backing the unify-
ing candidacy of Barack Obama.

It is a matter of fact that one
day soon we can elect a leader
that really is a “uniter” and not a
“divider.”

Barack Obama is moving clos-
er every day to bringing our coun-
try together again. Amen!

Every American child
so-called American Dream.
We all learn that this is the
land of opportunity, the place
where anyone, through hard
work, can grow up to be fa-
mous.

For a long time, of course,
the American Dream was
nothing but a dream. Only
white males were actually

welcome.
But with the recent an-
nouncements that Barack

Obama, Hillary Clinton and
Bill Richardson will seek the
Democratic nomination, the
dream is becoming more of a
reality.

The fact that an African-
American, a woman, and a
Hispanic are all seeking the
nation’s highest oﬁice means
that this country is moving
closer and closer to the equal-
ity it claimed to believe in.

Can any of these candi-
dates win the general elec-
tion?

Perhaps not, but there is
an excellent chance that one

grows up learning about the

staffeditorial
American Dream
and our election

Issues, not skin color, should dominate election

of them will at least be the
Democratic nominee.

Obama, who burst onto
the scene two years ago, has a
chance to become this gener-
ation’s Kennedy. '

Clinton, who has trans-
formed herself from an un-
popular ﬁrst lady to a highly
respected senator, leads some
of the early polls.

And while Richardson is
more of a long shot, his His-
panic heritage could mobilize
a group that rarely turns out
to vote in large numbers.

The Democratic primary
and general election are go-
ing to force the nation to ad-
dress continuing issues with
race and gender discrimina-
tion head-on. Will Americans
elect a woman? A black man?
A Hispanic?

As the nation addresses
these questions, W&L must
continue to examine them
on our own campus. Are we
truly committed to providing
a diverse environment, or are
we simply giving the idea lip
service?

We saw this debate play
out on our opinions pages
last year when an anonymous
parent said W&L was playing
favorites in the admissions
process. While that particular
debate does not need to be re-
played, the general discussion
needs to continue.

Here is the disturbing part
of these discussions: Instead
of considering the relative
merits of people—whether they
are presidential candidates or
admissions candidates—too
much of the talk still centers
around gender and race. _

Does it matter that Barack
Obama’s father is from Ke-
nya? Does his skin tone alter
his ability to balance the bud-
get or solve the war in Iraq?

The same applies for Clin-
ton and Richardson.

They deserve to be consid-
ered on their political merits,
not on their race or gender.

As. we watch to see if
America will truly vote like
a melting pot, our community
should try to see if we mea-
sure up.

Daughter, 9, frozen in time

Parents remove breasts, uterus from dependent brain—damaged daughter

By Grace Andrews
c o LU M N I s I

Want a topic that not only sets
precedent but is also controver-
sial?

The discussion of life and the

. control in which parents can exer-

cise in a child’s life stirs up emo-
tions and elicits strong reactions.

Ashley, a 9-year-old with static
encephalopathy, a form of severe
brain damage, will be forever
young; unlike the Neil Diamond
song, however, this may not be
such a joyous event.

Ashley is not choosing this
life of preadolescence for herself
— her parents are.

Ashley’s brain damage results
in a continuous near-catatonic
state, leaving her unable to sit
up, communicate, or eat; Ashley
is completely dependent on her
caregivers, who are her parents.

What her parents have decided
to do has rocked and surprised
both the medical and non-medical
community.

Ashley’s parents have had her
uterus removed to offset men-
struation and prevent pregnancy
in the case of rape. They have
also removed her breast tissue in
order to prevent a family history
of cancer from infecting her small
and fragile body. Ashley has also
undergone high-dose estrogen
therapy, which will keep her pe-
tite and light for the remainder of
her life.

Weighing 65 pounds and being
4 foot 5 inches makes the concept
of “remaining small” a daunting
feat that doctors have achieved.

The question now is, “Is it eth-
ical or humane to keep a child as
a child forever?”

For Ashley, remaining 9 years old
could turn out to be the best decision
her parents ever made for her.

There are those who upon
hearing this story automatically
judge the parents and criticize the
doctors, but I want you to stop
and think for a moment.

If you had the inability to eat,
roll over, or even keep your head
up, wouldn’t you want for your
caregivers to always be able to
care for you? That is the argument
that Ashley’s parents raise.

They support their decision to
let Ashley undergo this treatment
by saying on their blog, “A fun-
damental and universal miscon-
ception about the treatment is that
it is intended to convenience the
caregiver; rather, the central pur-
pose is to improve Ashley’s qual-
ity of life.

“Ashley’s biggest challenges
are discomfort and boredom; all
other considerations in this dis-
cussion take a back seat to these
central challenges.

“The ‘Ashley Treatment’ goes
right to the heart of these chal-
lenges and we strongly believe
that it will mitigate them in a sig-
niﬁcant way and provide Ashley
with lifelong beneﬁts.

“Ashley will be a lot more
physically comfortable: free of
menstrual cramps, free of the
discomfort associated with large
and fully—developed breasts, and
with a smaller, lighter body that
is better suited to constant lying

down and is easier to be moved
around.”

In the past few days, I have
read several articles and even ex-
plored the blog myself to see if
I could develop a well-informed
opinion.

I am not going to lie-when I
ﬁrst read some of the news sto-
ries, my heart was heavy. Yes,
Ashley is mentally and physically
handicapped, but does that mean
she doesn’t deserve the chance to
experience the one thing that is as
deﬁning as the journey into adult-
hood?

Many of Ashley’s physicians,
although reluctant at ﬁrst, support
the surgery,

Dr. Daniel Gunther states,
“some disability advocates have
suggested that this course of
treatment is an abuse of Ashley’s
rights’ and an affront to her dig-
nity.’ This is a mystery to me.

“Is there more dignity in hav-
ing to hoist a full-grown body in
harness and chains from bed to
bath to wheelchair? Ashley will
always have the mind of an in-
fant, and now she will able to stay
where she belongs—in the arms
of the family that loves her.”

Gunther and other doctors
maintain that they are still uneasy
about Ashley’s case. They want to
wait until a few more years have
passed, to see the side effects of

the treatment, if there are any.

I still have not reached a de-
cision about Ashley’s situation.
I deﬁnitely understand what the
difﬁculties of caring for a grown
woman and all the physical devel-
opments that come with that bur-
den can be in contrast to a small
girl, but is this the right thing?

Many fear that Ashley’s pre-
cedence could forever change the
medical landscape for disabled
children and their parents.

Every day, there are count-
less mentally handicapped people
whose parents send them to group
homes because they are no lon-
ger able to care for a child that
now has the strength and size
of an adult. In Florida, there are
over 16,000 people who are on a
waiting list for home services in
caring for their disabled child or
relative.

“Faced with Ashley’s medical
reality, as her deeply loving par-
ents, we worked with her doctors
to do all we could to provide Ash-
ley with the best possible quality
of life. The result is the “Ashley .
Treatment.”

This quote for me, along with
many others I found on the blog,
helped me see the story in con-
text. '

By itself, this story seems like
one void of love and full of ob-
ligation, but it is more than that.
Ashley’s parent really do love
her, and for Ashley, remaining
9 years old could turn out to be
the best decision her parents ever
made for her.

Ashley’s story is not one from
Peter Pan’s Lost Boys, but may-
be they had the right idea—being
young is sometimes the best op-
tion.

Annual Founder is Day celebrations
honor Lee is‘ contributions to campus

By Abri Nelson
STAFF WRITER

His memory permeates the air
wherever you walk——past every
portrait and building, every sign
bearing the name of the universi-
ty, even every napkin in the din-
ing hall. Lee.

General Robert E. Lee: presi-
dent of Washington College from
1865 to 1870, founder of the
school's traditions and command-
er of the Confederate Army.

It is the last point that often
causes people to stumble over the
honor of this man who seems to
have touched every brick walk-
way and stood under every white
colunm on the campus grounds.

The world remembers Lee
for his actions against the Union.
Washington and Lee remembers
him as a mzui of virtue and schol-
arship.

Last Friday marked the 200"‘
anniversary of Lee’s birth. W&L
honors Lee”s birthday as Found-
er"s Day every year with a short-

ened class schedule and midday
convocation.

This year, events ranging from
art exhibits to poetry readings to
guest speakers will span the entire
year as the campus community
reﬂects on his role as an educator
and benefactor of the school.

During the fall term, three stu-
dents enrolled in the art intem-
ship class and assisted curator
Pamela Smith in assembling an
exhibit featuring Lee for the new
Staniar Gallery in Wilson Hall.
The exhibit, entitled “Re-Vrsion-
ing Lee,” opened Friday after-
noon and will be in the gallery
until Feb. 2.

Junior Madeline Gent and se-
niors Kathryn Heaberg and Anne
Taylor Tipton each spoke about
how they contributed their skills
to researching Lee and how his
legacy affects our campus today.

“The honor system is un-
questionably Lee’s most lasting
contribution,” said Tipton, a se-
nior art history major. “But his
example overall, as a gentleman

who strove to lead by example,
even in the face of the greatest
changes of the century, I think is
even more important.”

As president, Lee tumed then
Washington College into a mod-
em university. Only 40 students
and four professors remained at
the school after the Civil War. By
Lee’s death in 1870, the school
boasted more than 400 students.

Lee added 10 new departments
and faculty positions to stall“
them, including what became our
journalism school and the ﬁrst
international studies program. He
also conceptualized a business
school, introduced the elective
system and built a dining hall, a
house for the president and Lee
Chapel. He invited a law school
in Lexington to incorporate with
Washington College.

Other contributions were less
tangible. Lee began the honor
system on the basis that every
man must be a gentleman.

Today, this system allows
students to schedule their own

ﬁnals, take un-proctored exams
and leave their belongings unat-
tended in campus buildings.

“I almost feel like I should
stop and thank Lee every time I
throw my bag down in the Com-
mons," Heaberg said.

He also added the speaking
tradition to campus life, encour-
aging students by example to
greet everyone.

Lee himself never forgot the
name of a student. According to
Gent’s research, he took a per-
sonal interest in the education of
every scholar, receiving weekly
reports of their studies and con-
tacting parents directly if the
need arose.

Heaberg and Gent, both from
Pennsylvania, confessed that all
they knew about Lee before com-
ing to W&L was that he was the
general of the Confederate Army.

“Lee is a symbol of something
more,” Heaberg said. “It is W&L
students who are charged with
carrying on Lee’s vision today
and in the future.”

Washington and Lee's design department ‘head,
Larry Stene, created the piece “Fearless and
Faultless.” W&L commissioned this piece to cel-
ebrate Lee’s 200th birthday (top and middle right).
The piece is a play on Lee through the lens of mod-
em art. it celebrates his life while commemorat-
ing his legacy. The actual plece depicts Lee's last
train ride through the South during his presidency.
A contrast from the other classic pieces in the ex-
hlbit, Stene’s work adds an additional dimension
to the exhibit. As student curator Madeline Gent

said, “it’s sweet.”

Junior Drew Prasse admires a piece of art at the
“Re-Visioning Lee” reception held last Friday after-

noon (mlddle left).

“Cigar Store Robert E. Lee” watches over the
exhlbIt’s visitors in the corner (bottom right).

Often cigar stores advertised using ﬁgures of indi-
ans. However, a few were made depicting famous
historical ﬁgures. For instance, this sculpture (bot-
tom) of Lee was recently given as a gift to W&L

THE RING-TUM PHI 0 7

 

By Sarah Klentz
STAFF WRITER

The annual Lip Sync com-
petition will make its much-an-
ticipated return this Friday at the
Pavilion.

Although the competition is
oﬁen associated with hilarious
performances and drunken de-
bauchery, senior Chris Lalli, pres-
ident of Students Against Rock-
bridge Area Hunger (SARAH),
explained how the event is in the
name of a good cause.

All proceeds from Lip Sync
will go to SARAH. '

Money will be raised through
ticket and t-shirt sales, in addition
to the $350 entry fee for each per-
formance.

This year, SARAH’s steering
committee has encouraged the
W&L community to make online
donations by sending an e-mail

to onnenf@wlu.edu with a name,
student ID number and the amount
the individual wishes to donate.

Aﬁer Lip Sync, Lalli said
SARAH will donate the money to
all the food pantries in the Rock-
bridge area.

Lip Sync 2006 raised enough
money to_purchase over 20 tons of
food, and the group is hoping to
raise more money this year.

Lalli said one reason why
SARAH is able to raise so much
money through the Lip Sync com-
petition is the “party atmosphere”

of the event.

However, this can also take
away from the seriousness of hun-
ger in the Rockbridge area.

“I think the party atmosphere
can both hurt and help the experi-
ence,” Lalli said.

“There are times when people

The acts will be judged by
well-known individuals on carn-
pus such as Executive Commit-
tee President Rob Rain, Director
of Campus Activities Margo Mc-
Clinton and several professors.

Lalli said the judges will name
the three best groups at the end of
the show.

“Winners are picked based
on the quality of their Lip Sync,
dance, costume and how appro-
priate the act is,” Lalli said.

Last year, Phi Kappa Psi earned
first place with its creatively cho-
reographed dance to the beat of
Michael Jackson’s “Thriller.”

A Multicultural Students Asso-
ciation group and a Kappa Alpha
Theta group captured acond and
third.

“We have begun to use a gong
similar to the Gong Show where
an act can be gonged off the stage
if they are terrible,” Lalli said.

Last year, several acts involv-
ing thongs and inappropriate
dancing were “gonged” oﬁ.

Any organization or group of
individuals can enter, but typi-
cally each fraternity and sorority
enters a group of new pledges to
perform in the event.

Lalli said this is one reason
why the event is so successful.

“Pledgeship deﬁnitely helps
the event, because people have
an excuse to make fools of them-
selves,” Lalli said.

Although students will joke
about Lip Sync next week around
campus, the event will ultimately
make a difference in the commu-
nity surrounding W&L.

The Lip Sync competition will
take place on Friday at 8 p.m. in
the Pavilion.

ginning on Wednesday, or $12 at

The men’s basketball team got
its week off to a thrilling start
on Wednesday night when they
squeaked by Emory and Henry
98-96. After keeping up with
Emory and Henry’s frantic full-
court style of play for 40 minutes,
the Generals got the victory when
sophomore forward Kirk Jones
tipped in a lay-up with 2.2 seconds
left. With the score tied at 96,
W&L guard Chris Halkitis tried
a three-pointer with 11 seconds
left.

Greg Bienemann grabbed

a lay-up, and then Femi Kusimo
missed a tip-in attempt with three
seconds on the clock. Finally, on
the Generals fourth attempt of the
possession, Jones managed to put
the ball in the hoop. Bienemann
scored 30 points to lead W&L.
Kusimo added 16 while missing
only one shot. Relying on a
steady diet of lay-ups and short
jumpers, the Generals shot a
blistering 68 percent from the
ﬂoor. The Generals split a pair
of road games over the weekend,
losing on Saturday to Hampden-
Sydney and winning on Sunday
at Lynchburg. On Saturday the
Generals could not overcome
poor play during the middle part
of the game. The Tigers went on
a 16-2 run late in the ﬁrst half to
take a 13 point lead. During the
first 10 minutes of the second half
Hampden-Sydney only allowed
four points as they marched out
to an 18 point lead. Bienemann
again led the Generals, scoring
17 points. Freshman Zac White
scored a career high 14 points for
the losing side. W&L ﬁnished up
its week by stomping Lynchburg
84-67 on Sunday afternoon. Aﬁer
shooting a blistering 60 percent in
the ﬁrst half, the Generals took a
42-31 lead into the locker room.
Bienemann tied his career-high by
scoring 33 points. He also added
six rebounds and three assists.
Jones and forward Alex White each
added 10. The Generals ended the
week with a 9-5 overall record
and a 4-4 record in ODAC play.
They play at Eastern Mennonite
on Wednesday and host Roanoke
College at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday
night.

Generals capture six ﬁrst—pZace ﬁnishes and
set three new school records against D-I foes

By Mike Fahey
SPORTS EDITOR

It’s always difﬁcult when
a Division III track team has
to compete against Division
I and 11 Opponents in a meet.
However, the Washington and
Lee men’s and women’s indoor
track and ﬁeld teams rose to the
challenge this past week. The
teams competed at the Mari-
etta Invitational Open held on
Saturday in Marietta, Ohio.
They set three new school re-
cords, while registering six ﬁrst
places and 17 top-ﬁve ﬁnishes.
Sophomore sensation Stacy Door-
nbos led the charge, placing ﬁrst
overall in the 300 meters and ﬁrst
among all D-III competitors in
the 500 meters.

Freshman Kat Telfeyan took
ﬁrst overall in the mile, and soph-
omore Elizabeth Webb was the

women’s

ﬁrst D-Ill runner to cross the ﬁn-
ish line in the 800 meters.

On the men’s side, sophomore
Drew Martin led W&L men by
placing second among all Divi-

- sion Ill athletes in the pole vault.

Freshman Ryan Castle placed
fourth among D-III competitors
in the long jump.

This was a great experience
for the Generals. As Martin said,
“It gave us a chance to ﬁnally see
how we stack up against some
other really good track teams.”

Castle agreed, saying, “Since
it’s so early in the season, these
types of meets are great to just
run against a little competition
to see where you’re at and what
you need to adjust in the weeks to
come.”

The teams have many
strengths, ranging from coaching
to age.

“The team’s greatest strength

After W&L went into the
locker room at half-time with a
29-28 lead, the Eagles stormed
out quickly in the second half,
eventually taking a nine point
lead with about fourteen minutes
remaining. The Generals eventu-
ally closed the gap and tied the
game with about eight minutes
remaining.

Emily Wolff eventually put,

W&L ahead for good when she
hit a lay-up with 1:33 left to play,
and the team hit four free throws
down the stretch’ to seal the win.

W&L kicked off the three
game home stand on Tuesday
night against two-time defending
conference champion Randolph-
Macon.

Though the Yellow Jackets no

longer have All-American guard
Megan Silva, they still managed
to defeat Washington and Lee 75-
64. The Generals simply could
not ﬁnd a way to stop sophomore
Lindsay Riesbeck as she piled up
26 points. Riesbeck scored Ma-
con’s ﬁrst eight points and helped
the Yellow Jackets jump out to a
quick lead that they would never
relinquish.

During the second half W&L
twice got the deﬁcit down to ﬁve
points, but both times costly tum-
overs hurt the team. With the
score 43-38 in Macon’s favor,
W&L missed an easy transition

lay-up and then surrendered a"

quick basket on defense.

The loss was the Generals’
twelfth in a row at the hands of
the Yellow Jackets and it snapped

is our coaching. You can’t ﬁnd a
better coaching staff anywhere,
and I swear by that,” Castle said.
“Coach Hoey would have and
should have been the coach of the
year every year since he’s been
here, except for the fact that we
haven’t won conference. That
will change.”

The Generals beneﬁt by hav-
ing a very young team.

Doombos said, “The girls team
has really gained some depth in a
bunch of events. We have some
new sophomore throwers on the
team that really add to the strength
of the girls team too.”

As the indoor season contin-
ues on, the team has high expec-
tations.

“With Hoey’s coaching and
recruiting skills combined with
our current athletes ability and
growth potential, I think the sky
is the limit,” Castle said.

W&L.

After several quiet games,
Hunsinger turned in a sterling per-
formance for the losing side. She
led W&L with 19 points and also
grabbed 10 rebounds. Most im-
pressive of all, Hunsinger scored
her points by hitting eight of the
10 shots she took.

The nine blocks Hunsinger
tallied on Thursday night were
just one part of a dominating box
score. She also scored 18 points
while grabbing a season-high 15
rebounds.

Her points, along with 24 from
junior forward Kristen Krouchick,
helped the Generals withstand
the 28 point night from Baldwin
guard Jessica Carter.

Carter used a variety of moves
and some deadly outside shooting
to help her team stay in the game.

Matt Harrison competes in last weekend’s Marietta
Open. Harrison led all W&L runners in the 500 meter

dash with a time of 1:11.70.

She entered the contest averaging
nearly 18 points per appearance.

W&L coach Mandy King said
Carter is always a tough player to
guard.

“You just cannot guard her
one-on-one,” King said. “You
rely on help defense and deny her
the ball as much as possible.”

Krouchick and King both said
they were excited by Hunsinger’s
performance.

“The blocks by Jessica give
us momentum, which helps us
when we’re not hitting shots,”
Krouchick said.

King said Hunsinger has re-
cently faced some of the league’s
toughest defenses, and she pre-
dicted that the senior would ﬁnish
strong down the stretch.

If Hunsinger plays like this
down the stretch, she’ll be very

tough to stop,” King said.

The Generals ~ as they often
have this year — struggled to pro-
tect the ball in both games. They
had 24 turnovers against the Yel-
low Jackets and 21 against the
Fighting Squirrels.

Carter had six steals against
W&L during Thursday night’s
game.

“[Mary Baldwin] brings great
pressure,” King said. “I think
there was a brief lack of focus
on our part, but once we adjusted
we were able to get good looks in
transition.”

The Generals will be on the
road this weekend traveling to
Guilford College on Tuesday
night before heading just a few
miles down Route 60 Thursday
evening for a 7:00 pm. tip-off at
Southern Virginia.

  Training trip unites team

Swimming team travels to Florida over break and gets tips from two Olympic Champions

SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee
University men’s and women’s
swimming teams faced a different
opponent in the pool over holiday
break, a 10-time Olympic cham-
pion.

Gary Hall Jr. helped the Gen-
erals train as part of their train-
ing to Key Largo, Fla. and even
agreed to race against some of the
men on the swimming team in a
50 meter race.

Hall Jr. and ﬁve-time Olympic
medal Jon Olsen helped to coach
the Generals in two practices dur-
ing the week-long trip.

During one of the practice
sessions, Hall Jr. agreed to race
against senior All~American
Mike Ginder and juniors Tim Mc-
Glaston and Alex Sweet. Ginder

to taking positions of leadership,
often under unexpected situa-
tions. In high school in Chatham,
New Jersey, Bienemann stepped
in as the goalie on the varsity soc-
cer team with little prior experi-
ence.

He also starred on the lacrosse
team and was named third team
all-state basketball in New Jersey,
notching 500 points his senior
season.

Bienemann is also a leader off
the court. An economics major,
Phi Kap, and ODAC Scholar Ath-
lete, Bienemann was also a mem-
ber of the Dean’s List Fall Term.

Bienemann has always shown
intensity on the court. A quiet fist
pump aﬁer hitting a last-second
shot during the ﬁrst half of the
game against Emory and Henry
shows the focus that he carries to
every game.

However, the problem has
sometimes been harnessing that
intensity for the good of the
team.

Said Coach Anderson, “We
always knew he could play, scor-
ing was never a problem, but the
challenge was getting him to cut
turnovers and creating opportuni-
ties for teammates.”

This season, it seems that this
challenge is beginning to be over-
come. “Guys have been willing
to sacriﬁce some of their numbers
to get the ball to Greg,” said An-
derson. “It’s a group effort, and
because of him, everyone is doing
the little things better... As good
of a player he is, he’s an even bet-
ter teammate.”

Yesterday afternoon, Biene-
marm tied his career-high for
point scored in a game when he
added 33 points in the Generals
84-67 victory over Lynchburg.

Bienemann is now averag-
ing 22 points per game and 6.7
rebounds per game. He’s putting
himself into strong contention for
ODAC player of the year.

The Generals face Eastern
Mennonite on the road on Wednes-
day. Their next home game is Sat-
urday night versus Roanoke.

Olympian. Sweet and Hall Jr.
touched the wall in a tie.

Senior captain Abbie Sauter
said, “It was incredibly interest-
ing to hear what they valued about
swimming and their take on rac-
ing, competition, practice, etc.”

And while some people spent
their holiday breaks relaxing, the
Generals were hard at work.

Sophomore Susan Mahoney
said, “The training trip is physi-
cally demanding. The practices
are tough, but having such great
teammates helps me get through
them.”

“Everyone on the team sup-
ports each other. We have a good
time together,” Mahoney contin-
ued.

The fact that the team was
practicing in Florida made the
week a bit more enjoyable. I

“The practices are very in-

tense, but the nice location helps V

us keep positive attitudes,” soph-

“As the sole senior woman on the team, I will

bite oﬁ’ my own arms-and beat Randy Mac to

death with them, before I will lose our 13 year

long ODAC winning streak. ”

ABBIE SAUTER, Senior Captain

omore Lindsey Strachan said.

Sauter said, “Not only were
we swimming for four hours a
day on some days, we were also
doing dryland workouts in 80 de-
gree weather.”

The team headed to Florida to
focus on their training in order to
preparefor the later half of the
season and conference champion-
ships.

“The purpose of the training
trip is to get us in really good
shape for the conference meet
somewhere we can focus on
swimminggand nothing else for a

few weeks,” junior Amy Rober-
son said.

As the women’s season con-
tinues, they have one goal, a four-
teenth consecutive ODAC cham-
pionship. But before the ODAC
championships, they will have
three dual meets against Hopkins,
Marymount, and Hollins.

Sauter said, “Hopkins is an
extremely competitive team that
will be fun to race against, but we
have the ability to dominate both
Marymount and Hollins and I am
excited to see the team rise to the
occasion and get that done.”

The Generals have developed a
rivalry with Randolph Macon this
season. After the Generals were
defeated by the Yellow Jackets at
a dual-meet earlier in the season,
the team has trained hard in prep-
aration of the ODAC champion-
ships where they will again get to
face off against R-MC.

Sauter said, “As the sole senior
woman on the team, I will bite off
my own arms and beat Randy
Mac to death with them before I
will lose our 13 year long ODAC
winning strea .”

After the dual meet between
RMC earlier in the season, a
swimmer from RMC posted a
quote on one of her teammate’s
facebook walls about “breaking
the tradition” that the Generals
have held at the ODAC champi-
onships.

“A newly added pump up
routine we have is to smack the
quote before each practice since
it hangs inside the door of our

locker room,” Sauter said. “See-
ing that sign daily reminds all of
us how excited we need to get
about [maintaining] the tradition
of winning at ODAC’s.”

Overall, the women’s swim-
ming team is a tight-knit group of
swimmers who are truly united as
a team, and the training trip only
brought the team closer together.

Freshman Sarah Simpson said,
“It was awesome to be able to
hang out with a group of people
that I like so much without having
to worry about school work and
all the other things that are usu-
ally stressing us out.

Sauter added, “The entire team
gets so much out of a little over a
week of training and it also brings
the team so much closer because
we all have to get through it to-
gether.”

Simpson said, “[The goals
are] to win ODAC’s, reset all the
school-record relay records, and
qualify for Nationals.”

Junior forward has helped propel men is basketball to a 9-5 record

STAFF WRITER

Time was winding down, and
Washington and Lee needed a
change of momentum. Tied at 78
with Emory and Henry College
with less than eight minutes to
play, the Generals were struggling
to hold off a conference opponent
that had rallied from ﬁfteen points
down. An E&H guard drove past
his defender, his path to the bas-
ket unobstructed. Suddenly, ju-
nior forward Greg Bienemann left
the man he was guarding, stepped
in front of the guard, and drew a
charge.

When asked for one moment
that deﬁned Greg Bienemann as a
player and a person, Washington

and Lee Head Basketball Coach
Adam Hutchinson pointed to this
charge, the most unselﬁsh, self-
sacriﬁcing action in the game of
basketball.

The Generals would go on to
defeat Emory and Henry 98-96,
spurred by 30 points and 13 re-
bounds from Bienemann, includ-
ing an offensive board that set up
the game-winning basket.

“I’d say that’s how Greg is a
leader,” said Hutchinson. “He
makes a point of taking care of his
teammates on the court.”

Bienemann did not respond to
several requests for comment.

Through this leadership, and
through what Coach Hutchinson
cites as “improved team execu-
tion,” W&L is off to its best start

in recent memory. Their 4-4 con-
ference record (9-5 overall) places
them fourth in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference, exceeding
the expectations of the coaches
who picked them to ﬁnish ninth.

Freshman John Twomey cred-
its the fast start to veteran lead-
ership. “The older guys really
know the system. It makes it a
challenge to stand out as a fresh-
man.”

And much of this leadership
has come from Bienemann. The
numbers are impressive: his 21.5
points per game is second in the
conference, but Bienemann’s
greatest inﬂuence on the team
cannot be measured by what ap-
pears in the stat book. Whether
it’s taking a foul while helping
out on defense, creating scoring
opportunities for teammates or
drawing a charge, what Coach
Anderson calls the “little things.”

“One of the problems Greg has
had this year is foul trouble,” said
Anderson. “He’ll step in when
one of the guys up top gets beaten
of the ball.”

Bienemann is no stranger

Women is basketball
team defeats a
nationally ranked
opponent for the

first time in history

By Jacob Gelger
MANAGING EDITOR

The women’s basketball team
made history Saturday night when
they defeated No. 24 Bridgewater
College 65-60. The win marked
the ﬁrst time that the women’s
team has beaten a ranked oppo-
nent.

The win came two days after
Center Jessica Hunsinger tallied
nine blocks against the Mary
Baldwin Fighting Squirrels, just
missing a triple-double but eas-
ily setting the school record for
blocks. Hunsinger set the tone by
blocking three shots by Baldwin
center Erica Dabney during the
ﬁrst 30 seconds of the game.

Washington and Lee withstood
a late Mary Baldwin rally and
came away with a 64-54 victory.

The victory over Bridgewater
was as surprising as it was impor-
tant. The Eagles entered the game
with a 12-2 record and a 9-1 mark
in conference play. The Generals,
in contrast, were 6-8 with a 3-7
conference record before playing
Bridgewater.

When the two teams met ear-
lier this year, Bridgewater handed
Washington and Lee a resounding
78-56 defeat. Senior Shannan
Scales, who scored a career high
25 points in the team’s ﬁrst meet-
ing, was held scoreless on Satur-
day by W&L’s relentless defense.

Kristen Krouchick led the
Generals on the offensive end,
scoring 22 points. Hunsinger and
Amanda Kane both added eight
points.

Hunsinger also pulled down
a season-high 17 rebounds, and
Krouchick came up with 10.

The Generals took advantage
of a lopsided free throw margin,
going to the line 31 times and
making 19 of those attempts.
Bridgewater, in contrast, , only
got 15 chances from the charity
stripe.

generated close to $1 million for
Washington and Lee University.

“The group has consistently
beaten the standard benchmark,
the S&P 500, which is really re-
markable.” said Executive Direc-
tor of WIS Peter Lawrence. “It’s
something that most head fund-
managers can ’t do.”

The Williams Investment So-
ciety is a student-run organization
that invests a portion of the uni-
versity’s endowment. When the
group began in February 1998, it
started out with $1 million. At its
lowest point, the endowment was
valued at $662,000.

But, in just over four years, the
value of the money invested has
reached $1.6 million. Last year,
the group perfomied in the 98th
percentile of professional man-
agers, which faculty advisor and
Business Administration profes-
sor Scott Hoover called “down-
right astounding.”

Hoover credits the group’s
long-temi success to their will-
ingness to take risks. “They have
a lack of bias that you see in a
lot of fund managers,” he said.
“They don’t particularly care if
they lose the money. Its not their
money and it’s not going to make
or break the university, which al-
lows them to invest in things that
may be riskier.”

The soCiety’s choice to invest
in Sealed Air Corporation is a
prime example. The corporation
had a lawsuit against it, which
would have prevented most fund
managers from even thinking
about buying stock in the com-
pany. However, after investigat-
ing the claims against the com-
pany, the W&L students decided
that the lawsuit had no merit and
bought stock in the company. The
gamble paid off.

“The group doubled their
money in a month,” said Hoover.
“But the reason they were able to
do that was because there were
no repercussions if they were
wrong.”

Lawrence also praised the
group’s remarkable success, but
he attributed their success rate to
two factors: the members’ ability
to remain detached from specific
stocks as well as sheer luck.

“One problem portfolio man-
agers have is that they get at-
tached to stocks,” said Lawrence.
“The high rate of member tum-
over means that you have a fresh
pair of eyes to look at the stocks
and decide ifit‘s time to sell."

Just last week, WIS selected
18 new members. These 18 were
chosen out of 64 applicants. As
part of the application. candidates
have to complete a buy-sell pre-
sentation, where they say “this is
what we want to buy” and “this is
what we want to sell.”

“The application itself serves
as a screening process,” said As-
sociate Director Paul Cobuzzi.
“We look at the amount of re-
search, time, and thought they put
into it.”

WIS versus the S&P 500:

1 Return for WIS
Return for S&P 500

 

Yum

The Williams Investment Society has anually outperformed the S&P 500, the standard Industry benchmark

Out of the 64 applications,
a little over half were chosen to
be interviewed. In the interview,
applicants were questioned about
recent ﬁnancial news. teamwork
and what they wrote on their ap-
plication. Not only were they ex-
pected to know about the current
ﬁnancial markets. but they were
expected to have attended previ-
ous WIS meetings and be willing
to make a big time commitment.
"The most important thing for
us was enthusiasm." said Law-
rence. “You have to be willing to
devote a lot of time to the group
outside of your other organiza-
tions."
Out of the 64 applicants. only
10 were women. Because they
received so few female applica-
tions. the directors are making an

effort to generate more interest
among females as well as other
minorities on campus.

“We‘ve recently emailed the
presidents of sororities and the
head of MSA [Multicultural Stu-
dent Association] and are trying
to reach out to other areas on cam-
pus that are not told enough about
it," said Cobuzzi. “We want them
to know that women are a part of
WIS and certainly contribute.”

Associate Director Lauren
Morea is planning a WIS Wom-
en‘s Night, which is aimed at
women who haven”t come to WIS
meetings but might be interested.

“The group would be stronger
if there was a more diverse set of
people," said Hoover. “You want
a set of different people and you
don ‘t just want C-School ma-

jors.”

While the society is--from
both the faculty and students’ per-
spectives--educational, the WIS
offers many other beneﬁts.

“It provides intangible experi-
ence,” said Lawrence. “It’s a great
source of education and satisfac-
tion as well as a source of attract-
ing students to the school.”

The countless hours that the
members spend each week re-
searching stocks to buy and sell
seem to pay off. According to
Hoover, several members of the
society will go on to jobs at some
of the country’s best investment
ﬁrms.

“[The Williams Investment
Society] is interview training 101
for ﬁnance jobs,” said Hoover. “It
really pays off in the job market.”

Holbrooke offers ideas on Iraq

Former diplomat shares his analysis on Iraq and other issues during Institute for Honor

By Jacob Gelger
MANAGING EDITOR

istinguished diplo-
mat Richard Hol-
brooke told the sixth
Institute for Honor
that the United States must work
to understand and solve the clear
cultural clash between extreme
Islam and the rest of the world.

Speaking in Lee Chapel on Fri-
day morning, Holbrooke outlined
his understanding of America’s
post-Cold War foreign policy and
extensively discussed the ongo-
ing war in Iraq.

“This is a worse situation
than Vietnam,” Holbrooke told
the crowd of students, alumni
and members of the Lexington
community. “The post-Cold War
world is full of dozens of long
submerged problems that were al-
ways there but stayed buried dur-
ing the Cold War.”

Holbrooke said far more peo-
ple live in free nations than in

1988, but he noted that formerly »

hidden feuds and problems were
now erupting.

A career diplomat, Holbrooke
started his Foreign Service career
in Vietnam. The journalism ma-
jor and former editor of Brown
University’s newspaper said he
joined the State Department al-
most by accident.

“My best friend growing up
was David Rusk,” Holbrooke
said. “His father was appointed
Secretary of State by Kennedy,
and suddenly I knew a famous
person. He’d talked to us about
joining the Foreign Service during
a career day during high school.”

Holbrooke returned home from
a State Department post in Viet-
nam and became Jimmy Carter’s
Assistant Secretary of State for
the Far East. During Bill Clin-
t0n’s ﬁrst term Holbrooke served
as Assistant Secretary of State for
Europe, and Clinton later named
him the U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations.

While discussing the situation
in Iraq, Holbrooke said the rein-

“Iraq will determine
everything... if it im-
proves people will
pull back and say we
should stick with it. ”

RICHARD HOLBROOKE, U.S. diplomat

forcements being sent into Bagh-
dad would not end the war.

“Iraq is the great crisis of our
times,” he said. “I worry that an
Iraq backlash will cause us to pull
back from our international obli-
gations, and we’ve seen this cycle
before in U.S. history.”

As W&L prepares for the 2008
Mock Convention, Holbrooke
said the war will dramatically
shape the coming elections.

“Iraq will be the dominant is-
sue as both parties choose candi-
dates,” the diplomat said. “[John]

McCain's decision to support
the war is costing him popular-
ity. McCain decided to support
Bush even though he hates him.
[Nebraska Senator] Chuck Hagel
is old friends with McCain. They
are both decorated Vietnam veter-
ans. and now they are barely talk-
ing to each other because of the
war.“

Holbrooke said that Hillary
Clinton has been the Democrat
least willing to attack Bush, while
John Edwards was calling for
an immediate withdrawal, and

 

Barack Obania is taking a posi-
tion somewhere between the two
of them.

‘‘We‘ll know the nominees
in 13 months," Holbrooke said.
“Iraq will determine everything...
if it improves people will pull
back and say we should stick with
it. But if it gets worse, things will
depend on which nominees win.”

Emeritus professor John Gunn
said Ilolbrooke provided‘ an ex-
cellent introduction for the con-
ference‘s later discussions.

“What matters most is not
military or economic power, but
the values and ideals  of what
we believe make a stable and just
society," Gunn said. “[We need
a] recognition of diversity and ac-
ceptance of different values.”

Bob Feagin, a member of the
class of 1960 who helped orga-
nize the Institute for Honor, said
the Institute chose Holbrooke
because it wanted a speaker who
would attract attention to the pro-
gram and its values.

“His topic is something that

is on the table today. We want to
discuss values that we think have
relevance,” Feagin said.

After concluding his speech,
Holbrooke said W&L students
should consider a career in the
Foreign Service.

“It’s a great career,” he said,
“but I’d encourage you to start
young...too many people start at
the age of 30.”

Holbrooke said the current
generation of college students was
not matching the involvement of
his baby boom contemporaries.

“My generation was much
more involved in public atfairs.
The baby boomers were engaged
much more than your genera-
tions.”

As Feagin leﬁ Friday’s lun-
cheon and headed to his ﬁrst
seminar, he explained what his
classmates hoped to achieve at
the Institute.

“We wanted to take W&L
ideals beyond here and into the
world. . .into the corporate board-
room and diplomatic discussion.”

sing America’s
respect for teachers

If teachers are so inﬂuential, why are they treated badly?

By Jess Steinmetz
C 0 LU M N I S T

Why would you want to
waste all your schooling and
potential on a job like that?

After hearing such criticism
from family and friends over
Christmas break about my cho-
sen career path, one might think
I decided to be a cashier at Wal-
Mart or a hairdresser.

While nothing is wrong with
either of those jobs, it would be
fair to say that four years of es-
say writing and test taking at a
reputable university would not
greatly improve my competency
at either of these jobs.

On the contrary, since I want
to teach government to high
school students after I graduate,
my politics major and teacher
education training here at Wash-
ington and Lee will be a great
help to me. .

You would think that with
the current state of education in
the United States, people would
want highly qualiﬁed individuals
teaching adolescents about our
government so they would have

. the background to make well-

informed decisions on Election
Day. Instead, people have told
me time and time again that if I
wanted to be a teacher I should
have just gone to a community
college.

Why do teachers have such
a lack of respect in today’s so-
ciety? Aren’t teachers the ones

Aren ’t teachers the ones who pre-
pare the next generation to deal with
the problems of the world?

who prepare the next generation
to deal with the problems of the
world?

Don’t they help develop the
minds of the people who will
soon be running our nation?
Aren’t teachers the ones respon-
sible for training individuals for
all future professions?

Does the general public have
such a gross lack of knowledge
about what teaching high school
students encompasses?

Contrary to popular belief,
teaching is not the easy 8a.m. to
3p.m. job with summers off.

Instead, it involves devoting
extra time and attention to plan
lessons relevant to students’
lives that will interest them
enough to truly motivate them.

Good teaching requires hold-
ing high expectations for stu-
dents and putting in the extra
work so they can reach their
potential.

It involves devoting numer-
ous hours after the school day
ofﬁcially ends to write college
recommendation letters, edit
college admission essays, grade
papers, and give advice to stu-
dents who come to ask for help.

In this day and age, it also
involves balancing between the
thin line of preparing students to
pass high—stakes tests (such as
the SOL tests here in Virginia)
without falling into the trap of
simply teaching to the test.

It is bad enough that teachers
are paid next to nothing for all
the hard work they put into their
jobs. Why can’t people whole-
heartedly support those who go
into teaching?

I accept that I will make far
less money than many of my
peers in the years to come, but
I look forward to spending days
in the classroom teaching my
students about the basic struc-
ture of government in American
society. I personally cannot see
any better way to make a differ-
ence than to teach young people
how to critically think about
abortion, gay marriage, terror-
ism, international involvement,
education policy and the various
issues of our day.

If I can deal with the strug-
gles of motivating my students
day after day, why can’t others
deal with my motivation to be a
teacher?

  Schools crack
down on press

Dialogue key for First Amendment protection

Student newspapers and
college administrators seldom
agree about everything, but at
most schools they learn to live
with each other.

This year, however, that
hasn’t always been the case.

Last week Provost Rob-
ert Dixon at Grambling State
University in Monroe, La. an-
nounced that the university’s
student run paper was “sus—
pended” until the end of Janu-

Dixon said that the paper’s
performance during the fall
had been poor and that no
more editions should come out
until the quality improved.

But Darryl Smith, student
editor of The Gramblinite,
said his paper is going to keep
coming out.

That’s exactly the action
he should take.

In Dixon’s defense, The
Gramblinite has had its prob-
lems in the past months. One
of the paper’s sports writers
plagiarized materials from an-
other local newspaper. Dixon
also claims The Gramblin-
ite has not done a good job
checking its facts on some
articles.

Smith has a simple re-

sponse to the fact-checking
allegations. He said his pa-
per cannot check their facts if
administrators will not talk to
his reporters.

Though the paper has made
mistakes, suspending publica-
tion is the wrong course of ac-
tion. How does Dixon expect
improvement if the paper isn’t
publishing?

Student journalists learn
by trial and error. If Dixon
stops the presses after each
error, no improvements will
be made.

Thankfully, Washington
and Lee administrators have
taken a far different course
than their counterparts at
Grambling State. Though
they do not always see eye-to-
eye with the Phi and Trident
on every issue, they respect
each paper’s ﬁrst amendment
rights.

All they ask for in return
is fair and thorough reporting.
That is a request we at the Phi
consider more than reason-
able.

We are committed to get-
ting all the facts, asking all the
necessary questions, and pre-
senting all sides of each story.
And the administration has

responded in kind by opening
up and letting our reporters in
the door.

When we wanted to learn
more about the proposed
Master Plan, Vice President
for Administration Joe Grasso
was more than happy to an-
swer questions. When we
wanted a preview of Inau-
guration Weekend, President
Ruscio took time out of his
hectic schedule and gave us a
Saturday morning interview.

This commitment to co-
operation has not gone un-
noticed. It is obvious that the
dialogue at W&L is far more
frank and open than the con-
versation at Grambling State.
When the student press and
administration disagree, we
sit down to discuss the issue.
When the same disagreement
occurs at Grambling, the pro-
vost tries to shut down the
paper.

If W&L’s administrators
keep holding open and honest
conversations with reporters
from student publications, we
will not face a situation simi-
lar to Grambling’s.

So long as both sides keep
talking, everyone keeps win-
ning.

The demise of democracy

Hugo Chavez is rule by decree for 18 months won ’t help poor as promised

By Abel Delgado
COLU M NIST

If ever there has been a time
when a democracy committed
suicide, it’s now in Venezuela.

Hugo Chavez has done just
about everything within his
power toiturn what was once
one of the few stable countries
in Latin America to the birth-
place of the new and improved
militant left.

The former military ofﬁcer,
who decided to run for president
only after his coup failed and he
was somehow pardoned, has
truly revolutionized Venezuela.

Chavez has done everything
from changing the country’s
name to rewriting its constitu-
tion. Now he gets to rule by de-
cree.

Yes, the joke of a National
Assembly, ﬁlled with Chavez
supporters after opposition par-
ties refused to take part in fraud-
ulent elections, unanimously
approved giving the dictator, I
mean “president”, the authority
to make laws by decree for the
next 18 months.

Whoever believes the period
is going to last only 18 months
is kidding themselves.

Everybody should know by
now that Chavez would like
nothing more than to rule for as
long as and in the same style as
his mentor Fidel Castro.

If you think Chavez might

Everybody should know that Chavez
would like nothing more than to rule
in the same style as Fidel Castro.

use his newly granted powers to
help the poor, as he has repeat-
edly promised, just take a look
at his current objectives.

He plans a government take-
over of the national telecom
company, which he accuses of
spying on him, and shut down
networks which have been
friendly to the opposition.

He also plans to national-
ize the entire ‘energy sector and
forcibly buy at least 51 percent
of all stock in foreign oil com-
panies operating in Venezuela.

Chavez and his “brother” (a
term they often use to describe
themselves) Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are
also planning to push OPEC
to cut oil production, raising
oil prices across the world and
making sure their ridiculous
government programs will be
well-funded.

Right after winning the past
election, Chavez decided itwas
okay to ﬁre his vice president
and consolidate all his “allied”
parties into one party under his
sole control.

He has proclaimed only his
most ardent supporters could
serve in the military or work for
the Venezuelan oil company.

His current term lasts until
2013 but in his weekly ﬁve-hour
long speeches on national tele-
vision, he has more than alluded
to the idea of ruling for a lot lon-
ger, possibly for life.

On the foreign front, Chavez
has built strong alliances with
the aforementioned Iran, China,
and Syria, three of the most re-
pressive regimes in the world.

He has continually meddled
in other Latin American elec-
tions, sometimes causing his
allies to lose and is now calling
for a uniﬁed Latin American
military similar to NATO, only

 

under his control.

He continually threatens to
boot out the U.S. Ambassador
to Venezuela and has already
had to sever relations with a few
Latin American countries.

Anyone who believes all this
is justiﬁed by the help Chavez
has given Venezuela’s poor
should know that, until the oil
boom three years ago, Venezu-
ela was actually getting poorer
under Chavez.

He has used his windfall oil
proﬁts to buy votes right before
elections, fund socialist candi-
dates and visit dictators across
the world.

He has even allegedly fund-
ed the leftist terrorist guerillas
in neighboring Colombia.

Yes, Chavez did win this past
election, no matter how much
its legitimacy could understand-
ably be questioned, but the elec-
tion Venezuela has paradoxical-
ly brought the end of democracy
in Venezuela.

If we are not careful, Chavez
could usher in a terrible age for
the entire hemisphere.

Seniors salutedforfeats  

Meghan Joss and Kelly Evans received national award for accomplishments and campus involvement

By Abrl Nelson
STAFF warren

This fall, two Washington
and Lee seniors reached into
their mailboxes and pulled out
an acceptance letter that they
were not expecting.

The letter detailed an award
for which they had not applied.
It informed them that they had
been selected to be featured in
the annual “Who’s Who Among
Students in American Colleges
and Universities” book.

Meghan J oss turned immedi-
ately to the Internet to ﬁnd out
about the award.

Kelly Evans thought that it
was a joke and threw the letter
away, only to get another from
Dean Dawn Watkins several
months later conﬁrming the fact
that it was a legitimate organi-
zation.

The Who’s Who Among Stu-
dents program was conceptual-
ized in 1933 by Pettus Randall,
then an undergraduate student at
the University of Alabama.

Randall had been invited to

join numerous academic hon-
ors programs and societies, but

he could not commit to any of
them because of membership
dues and initiation fees. Randall
designed an honors program that
would accept students based on
their achievements and allow
them membership for free.

Students would be featured in
a book detailing their biographi-
cal information which would
be sent to potential employers
around the country.

The program was expanded
in 1966 to include junior col-
leges and still publishes a book
about exceptional college stu-
dents each year.

Campus nominating com-
mittees select 50 students each
fall and send their information
to the organization for ﬁnal se-
lection.

As a high school student,
Joss,said that she had a check-

to repeat tenth grade as a result
of severe health issues from an
eating disorder.

“The only way I could stay

Doing Everything, and
Loving It

Evans, a native of Lexington,
was recruited at W&L to play
lacrosse. She came with plans
to get involved in much more.

She especially wanted to be a
member of the University Cho-
rus, participate in the theater
department and be involved the
planning committees for Fancy
Dress or Mock Convention. But
plans changed for her, too.

She found that between her
lacrosse schedule, studying
abroad for a year and her major
in business journalism that she
was unable to ﬁt many things
into her schedule that did not
coincide with her major or her
sport.

“It’s almost like it all hap-
pened by accident,” she said.
“I’m deﬁnitely one of those
people who wants to do every-
thing, and I always end up bit-
ing off more than I can chew.”

She tried to write for The
Trident for most of her ﬁrst two
years of school, but was not
very involved until this year
when she was named co-editor
with junior Will Chamberlain.

She has also served as an
ESOL tutor, the chair of the
Freshman Orientation Commit-
tee, a tour guide and participated
in W&L Student Consulting.

“I feel like I’ve gotten so
much out of this place that it’s
nice to give something in re-
turn,” Evans said. “I feel an ob-
ligation to hold up my end of the
bargain and give back.”

Evans, was able to attend
W&L as a George Washington
Honors Scholar.

W&L also helped her to get a
coveted internship with the Wall
Street Journal this summer and
one with Reuters last summer.

She was also inducted into
the Omicron Delta Kappa soci-
ety on Founder’s Day.

“Too many people don’t do
things because they think they
aren’t qualiﬁed,” Evans said.

“It’s nice to be able to look
back fondly. I had a blast, and
it’s time to move on.”

Sophomore Chris Rucker, senior Frank Lee iii and freshmen Joseph Roane, Kenneth Hopkins and Zaq Lawai clinch the first place trophy last Friday night during Lip Sync. .

STAFF wnmzn

In addition to being an ex-
tremely successful charity event,
the annual Lip Sync competi-
tion, which took place on Friday
night, is often thought to be one
of the most entertaining nights of
the year. The audience saw that
anything goes when fraternities
and sororities have their pledges
perform. However, the winning
group this year was not from a
Greek house, but from the Multi-
cultural Students Association.

Though fellow members attri-
bute the choreography of MSA’s
dance to freshman Zaq Lawal, he
said it was a group effort.

“Everyone put in an equal
amount of work and came up with
choreography,” Lawal said with a
smile. “Jumping over four other
guys—not my idea.”

Lawal said he and the other
members of the group, freshmen
Kenneth Hopkins and Joseph
Roane, senior Frank Lee III and
sophomore Chris Rucker, prac-
ticed the dance for about an hour
and a half each day starting the
Sunday before the performance.

The group decided to use a
medley of songs the crowd would
love.

Lawal said that classics like
‘NSYNC’s “Bye Bye Bye” and
Sisq<')’s “Thong Song” were two
crowd favorites the group knew

A the audience would react to.

,Lawal added that MSA already
has some ideas for next year’s
Lip Sync, but they are waiting for
new songs to come up before they
make any ﬁnal decisions.

Runner-up was awarded to one
of Kappa Alpha Theta’s groups
of freshmen pledges. According

“I know people are there to see friends act like

idiots on stage, but at the end of the day, if thats

what raises $14,000, the end justiﬁes the means. ’

I

TRIPP ONNEN, Advisor to SARAH
 

to freshman Elizabeth Micci, the
group also began working on its
performance the Sunday before
Lip Sync, and put in over two
hours each night thereafter.

“The reason it took so long
was that there were so many steps
we had to get just right,” Micci
said. “When Friday came we were
ready and everyone was excited. I
don’t think anyone was nervous.”

Micci added that each of the
seven girls in the group had some
dance or cheerleading experi-
ence.

Overall, Micci said she felt the
event was more organized than
she had anticipated.

“Compared to stories I’d heard
[about past Lip Syncs], it seemed
pretty under control,” Micci said.
“There were not too many people
up there walking around, doing
nothing. Everyone had a plan.
There was so much excitement
associated with all the different
acts. The energy and creativity
made it so muchifun.”

Freshman Kelsey Wright per-
formed with fellow Chi Omegas
to win third place. Like the ﬁrst
and second place performances,
Chi O’s group also compiled a
medley of songs.

“Overall, I was very impressed
with'the caliber of the competi-

tion,” Wright said. “There were

many acts that deserved to win.”
Referring to the $350 entry

fee, raised from $150 in previous
years, Wright said, “I think the
increased fees encouraged every-
one to practice and perform their
very best.”

Performances were judged

‘based on the following criteria:

choreography, lip synching abil-
ity, costumes, timing (acts were
supposed to be capped at ﬁve
minutes) and the crowd’s reaction.
Each judge ranked performances
from one to ten in each category,
and the judges’ scores were com-
bined to give each group a score
out of 300. Tripp Onnen, advisor
for Students Against Rockbridge
Area Hunger, said MSA received
a score of 288.

Onnen also said groups that
were too inappropriate were
“gonged” off the stage. As for
the threat of a $500 ﬁne for being
gonged, Onnen said from the be-
ginning the judges knew “that just
wasn’t going to happen.”

“The $500 threat was meant
to scare [students] out of doing
something too gratuitous,” Onnen
said.

He added that the staff never
had an intention of actually ﬁning
groups for inappropriate behav-
ior, though Onnen said if some-
thing extremely outlandish had
occurred, he would have been
willing to ﬁne a group. Instead,
he said, “we were just trying to
put the fear of God into them, so

MSA brings iton

Students choreograph acts to raise $1 4, 000 for local charity working to alleviate hunger

to speak.”

Onnen said there was only one
group he was “pretty upset with,
but other than that, I think it was
done very well.”

Margo McClinton, Director
of Campus Activities, was one of
the judges for the event. She said
criteria for being gonged included
acts that were “just not very good

-or crude.” Overall, McClinton

said acts were “more appropriate”
this year. i

“There were some really good
acts this year,” McClinton said.
“I could tell people took time to
choreograph.”

EC President Rob Rain said he
enjoyed judging the event for the
ﬁrst time this year, and like Me-
Clinton, he “did not feel that very
many of the acts were too inap-
propriate--at least no more inap-
propriatethan in years past.”

According to Onnen, the event
raised about $14,000 to be donat-
ed to local food pantiies.

Onnen said there is no denying
that students attend Lip Sync for
the entertainment, but the money
raised is the most important part
of the experience.

“I know people are there to see
friends act like idiots on stage, but
at the end of the day if that’s what
raises $14,000, the end justiﬁes
the means,” Onnen said.

He also added that it is impor-
tant for students to be aware of
the world outside campus.

“A lot of people blow through
here in four years and don’t think
about the people you see at Wal-
Mart or Stop-In who live here
their whole lives,” Onnen said.
“[Lip Sync] is a great way to give
back to the community that be-
comes your second home for four
years.”

Women’s Basketball

The Washington and Lee women’s
basketball team went undefeated
last week, defeating Southern
Virginia on Thursday evening
and Guilford College on Tuesday
night. The Generals defeated
SVU by a score of 66-62. The
Generals were led by junior for-
ward Amanda Kane who scored a
season-high 13 points. Kane also
hit three three-pointers. Senior
center Jessica Hunsinger scored
12 points and pulled down 13
rebounds. Hunsinger also got
three blocks. Sophomore guard
Bethany Ridenhour posted 12
points and three assists. Junior
forward Kristen Krouchick added
in 11 points and six rebounds. The
W&L women’s basketball team
managed to pull oﬂ‘ a 49-46 win
over Guilford despite shooting
just 29.2 percent from the ﬁeld.
The Generals carried a one-point

‘advantage over their ODAC foe

into the half, and Hunsinger went
on to score six straight points to
open the second stanza, giving
W&L a seven-point lead. Guilford
then went on a 12-1 run to take
back the lead. Sophomore forward
Kara Nadeau responded by hitting
a jumper to cut Guilford’s lead to
a slim two points. Back-to-back
layups Krouchick gave the Gener-
als a 47-45 lead with 25 seconds
remaining. Guilford’s Jasmine
Wood converted on 1-of-2 foul
shots with 18 seconds left to cut
the lead to 47-46, but W&Lsopho-
more guard Bethany Ridenhour
hit a pair of free throws with 12
seconds left to clinch victory for
the Generals. The Generals were
led by Hunsinger’s 16points, 12 of
which came in the second half, and
11 rebounds. Ridenhour tallied
seven points, nine rebounds and
four assists. On Tuesday evening,
the women ’s basketball team tied
a program record by winning their
ﬁfth consecutive game, defeat-
ing Emory & Henry 62-44. The
Generals improved their record to
10-8, equaling their record in the
2001-2002 season.

Track and Field

The Washington and Lee men’s
and women’s indoor track & ﬁeld
teams competed against Division
I, II and III schools at the Liberty
On Track Open on Friday and Sat-
urday. Over the two-day contest,
the Generals captured four ﬁrst-
place ﬁnishes, 25 top-ﬁve ﬁnishes

\ and set one school-record. The

women were led by freshman Kat
Telfeyan, who took ﬁrst among
Division III competitors in the
3000 meters. Sophomore Becca
Taylor crossed the ﬁnish line ﬁrst
among D-III opponents in the
mile. Junior Lil Brandler was the
top D-III competitor in the pole
vault clearing a height of 2.90 me-
ters. Freshman Maggie Sutherland
scored the Generals’ lone school
record with her 5’3” performance
in the high jump. The men were
led by sophomore Drew Martin
and freshman Billy Billington.
Each placed second among Divi-
sion III athletes in their respective
events. Martin registered a 143”
performance in the pole vault,
while Billington recorded 12.10
meters in the shot put. Washington
and Lee returns to action on Friday
as it competes at the VMI Winter
Relays in Lexington.

 

Greatest player ever‘?  

F ederer wins tenth Grand Slam tournament at Australian Open without dropping a set.

By Adam Lewls

he Swiss may be
known for their
banks, knives, and
cheese, but I think
its time to add one more
thing to that
list: tennis.
The world
of tennis is
currently being
taken over by
a Swiss man
named Roger
Federer.
Federer
just notched his third Aus-
tralian Open championship.
all the while shedding about
three drops of sweat. He won
the tournament without los-
ing a single set, something that
has not been done in a Grand
Slam event since 1980! And
if you have trouble realizing
the magnitude of that, think of
a NFL team wi1111ing the Super
Bowl after not giving up a sin-
gle touchdown throughout the

whole playoffs. It‘s that amaz-
ing. Instead of shaking hands
after losing. his opponents may
as well have gotten on their
knees, bowed, and said “We’re
not worthy,” because honestly,
they‘re not.

And if you watch him play,
you will see why. With his over-
powering serve, silky-smooth
groundstrokes, and composed
playing style, he is the most
graceful sight on the tennis court
since Anna Kournikova stretch-
ing. And I think that is saying
a lot. Just this past Australian
Open finals, Federer faced Fer-
nando Gonzalez, who was com-
ing oil‘ victories against num-
ber 5-seeded James Blake and

number 2-seeded Rafael Nadal.
Not only did Roger take down
Gonzalez in straight sets, but in
a string often service games, he
lost only four points. Can you
say total domination?

He goes through tournaments
like an overweight child goes
through a box of cookies—de—
vouring each cookie (opponent)
one by one, rarely dropping a
crumb (set), until there is noth-
ing left except the box (trophy).
And, like watching this child
complete his tremendous feat,
all you can do while watching
Federer is gape in awe. He’s
that good.

But how does he match up
with the sport’s all-time greats?

Well, in three years of holding
the number one world ranking,
Federer has a 247-15 record,
which is ﬁfteen wins more than
second place’s Ivan Lendl, who
is regarded by some as the best
player of all time. Additionally,
in those three years, he has 34
titles, which is more than Lendl,
Pete Sampras, Bjorn Borg, An-
dre Agassi, and Jimmy Con-
nors.

That’s averaging over eleven
wins a season, for three straight
years, something thattnone of
the afore-mentioned players has
ever accomplished. So those
scrubs can start bowing as well.

And to continue rambling off
career achievements, Federer
is less than a month away from
holding the longest consecutive
streak at Number 1.

Moreover, he is the three-
time defending champion at
Wimbledon and the US Open,
something that has never been
done before. If there was ever
a dynasty in tennis, I think now
would be the time.

A And tennis isn’t the only

Swimming:

thing in which this Swiss man
sits at the top. In 2006, he was
named the Goodwill Ambassa-
dor to UNICEF, an organization
that assists impoverished chil-
dren around the world. Through
UNICEF and his personal char-
ity, the Roger Federer founda-
tion, Federer has helped fund
the recovery of tsunami victims,
made trips to South Asia, and
participated in various chari-
table events which raise money
for his causes. ,

With all of these charity ef-
forts, as well as his media ap-
peal to all people (he speaks
three languages), and oh yeah,
his tennis ability, it is no wonder
why Roger Federer is constantly
being awarded honors such as
the European Sportsman of the
Year, the United States Sports
Academy’s Most Outstand-
ing Athlete of the Year, and the
Laureus World Sportsman of
the Year.

So whether you’re into sports
betting or charity, your money
is far safer with this Swiss asset
than in those stupid banks.

you may have taken us out in
the dual meet but you have no idea
what you are facing at ODACS,”
Sauter warned.

“All the strength that we’Ve
built up for the past couple of
months will become evident
when we beat Randy-Mac again,
and swim the best we ever have,”
said Miata.

“We have gained so much
from racing bigger and better
teams. Racing mediocre teams
does nothing but boost the ego;
swimming against the teams that
we have swum with this year has
helped us in every respect of the
game. While we may not come
out on top against ranked D-III
teams, the most important part is
that we have gained racing experi-
ence that will most deﬁnitely help
us going into another ODACS,”
said Sauter.

The women return to action
next Saturday against Hollins and
host Randolph-Macon Women’s
College in a double dual meet.
They will then beginpreparing
for the ODAC Championships.

On Friday, several underclass-
men were called upon to lead the
men against Marymount. Sopho-
mores Chris Diebold and Brett
Tatman touched ﬁrst in the 200
free and 100 breast and freshman
Winston Stagg won the 100 back.

Particularly impressive was
Kevin Com’s 4:57 in the 500 free
because he had switched from
breaststroke to distance freestyle
halfway through the season.

“It was a very strong race for
someone who is inexperienced
at the 500, and it’s a promising
sign for what he’ll be able to do at
Bluegrass. He’s one of the hard-
est workers in practice,” said Tim
McGlaston.

However, the men were more
focused on Saturdays meet

against Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity. Coming into the meet, the
men boasted a 9-0 record in dual
meets and were ranked 14"‘ in
the country. Johns Hopkins was
ranked 13"‘ nationally and some
have picked them to ﬁnish as

high as third at nationals this year.
Though Shinoﬁeld predicted the
Generals would “need to swim
the perfect meet to win,” he knew
“the guys had the ability to pull it
together.”

Shinoﬁeld’s optimism came
up short on Saturday as the men
suffered their ﬁrst dual meet de-
feat of the season by score of 146-
110.

“Now we know what it takes to
win against really good competi-
tion. It puts our prior success this
season in perspective, and it will
help us focus on where we need
to improve before the champion-
ships,” said Tim McGlaston.

Though the result was disap-
pointing, there were several bright
spots for the men. Tim McGlaston
won the 50 free against one of the
best Division III sprinters in the
country, Hopkins’ Brad Test.

In the ﬁnal event, the 400 free
relay, anchor Mike Ginder made
up a half second on Hopkin’s Test
to give the Generals the victory by
less than two tenths of a second.

“Ginder ﬁnished amazingly
strong and out-touched the Hop-
kins relay. Despite not having one
of the best meets of our season,
this was a great way to end the
meet and prove that we are ca-
pable of competing with the best
teams in the nation,” said Kevin
Corn.

The men appear to have put
the loss behind them as they pre-
pare for their next meet in Blacks-
burg, Va., against VMI and host
Virginia Tech.

“I‘don’t think we need to do
anything [diﬁ”erently],” said Alex
Sweet. “I think that we are going
to be so frustrated, not so much
because of the loss, but because
we didn’t even make it close.
Everyone should be focused next
week and looking to bounce back
and put some fear into a fully
funded D-l team [Virginia Tech].
I think the loss to Hopkins is only
going to make us want to beat
them more when we swim them
at nationals,” Sweet added. “It
would be easy to gain back all
that was lost this weekend with a
few good swims at nationals.”

Hopkins pins Generals

Wrestlers lose one—point decision to Johns Hopkins on Saturday

By Madeline Gent
STAFF wmrsn

Washington and Lee Wrestling
had a very busy last week. Dur-
ing last Wednesday’s match with
Southern Virginia University the
Generals completely dominated
the mats with a 48-6 victory.
With eight individual victories,
the dual-meet triumph was a
much needed conﬁdence booster
going into Saturday.

On Saturday afternoon, the
Generals hosted John Hopkins
in a Centennial Conference dual
meet. The Generals walked away
with four individual victories in
the one point team loss. Freshman
Sammy Brusca got much needed
back points towards the end of his
match, allowing him to secure a
tech fall over Hopkin’s Michael
Sumner in the 125 weight class.
Within the last minute and a half,
Brusca turned his opponent twice,
giving the Generals ﬁve team

Weekend

When we got into Jackson-
ville, downtown had been closed
off. There were food and beer
stands set up all along the road and
masses of people milled around
the city. We hung out in down-
town Jacksonville for a while and
then drove back to our hotel.

My hair had gotten long while I
was away at school, and my older
brother and dad had been bugging
me to cut it since we got on the
plane to head down. In the mom-
ing, before I woke up, my dad and
older brother went out and got an
electric razor. When I woke up,
I agreed to let them cut my hair.
My dad decided to try and make
the sides shorter than the middle,
but the plan fell apart when he
cut the two sides very unevenly.
We ﬁnally decided to cut bait and
leave the haircut as it was.

Afterwards, we drove into
Jacksonville for the game. The
NFL had a big pre-party going
outside Alltell Stadium. There
was a huge tent with several buf-
fet tables and open bars inside
as well as several football video
game demos. Outside the tent
was a live band, an area when you
could meet current and former
NFL players, several shops for
Super Bowl memorabilia and a
few live TV broadcasts. We hung
out at the party for a while and
then went into the game.

There was a seat cushion with
a package of souvenirs attached
to it on every seat. One of the
things in the souvenir pouch was
a while cardboard sheet that we
were supposed to hold up during
halftime for a special effects part
of the iight show.

P Diddy, or whatever he goes
by now, was about twenty rows in
front of us on the left.

After we watched the Patriots
beat the Eagles, we went back
outside for the post-party. In the
same tent as the pre-party, they
had again set up several open bars
and had stocked the buffet tables
with desserts. After hanging
around the post party for a while,
we drove back out to our hotel
and got up early in the morning to
ﬂy back to school before class.

Junior Anthony Boniello add-
ed a victory at 165 pounds over
JHU’s Kyle Keane. The biggest
win of the day would have to go
to junior Peter Lawrence in the
157 pound weight class. He de-
feated Hopkin’s James Crumlish
in an 8- 6 win. Lawrence lost to
Crumlish earlier in the year, but
by dominating the mat on his feet
he secured some much needed
take downs.

Junior wrestling teammate
Adam Hockensmith thought it
was quite the match. “It was just
so sick,” he said.

Junior Dave Shubick also won
his 133 pound match by forfeit.

Junior Jesse Sataloff and soph-
omore Rob Terrin had close bouts
in the 141 and 174 weight classes
respectively. Terrin’s loss was
a tight decision the entire way
through, and Sataloff’s loss was
by an one point escape by JHU’s
David Kraus.

“We ’re going up against some conference lead-

ers. Its going to be real tight. If we win a few

key matches we can get it. ”

ANTHONY BONIELLO, W&L wrestler

Sataloff and Kraus had
wrestled previously and both
knew their opponent well. There
were no take downs or reversals
throughout their entire match.

“I thought it was a team ef-
fort,” said Lawrence. “We had a
lot of kids wrestle well. It was
really close because we lost two
matches by just three, and with
a point or two from any other
matches it would have gone our
way.”

Collecting six individual vic-

, tories, Hopkins left campus with

an 18- 17 victory over the blue
and white.

The Generals will return to the
mat this Saturday afternoon when
they host McDaniel, Muhlenberg,
and Ursinus starting at 11 a.m.

“We’re going up against some
conference leaders,” said Boni-
ello. “It’s going to be real tight. If
we win a few key matches we can
get it.”

With two opposing wrestlers
ranked within the top eight of the
country in their weight classes,
Saturday’s match will be an excit-
ing one for the Generals.

“We’re trying to keep up a high
intensity and ﬁnish up the season
strong,” said junior Eric Gagne.

I must make a confession:
I’m a huge fan of both Peyton
Manning and Tony Dungy.
Peyton Manning works as
hard as anyone in sport. His
work ethic rivals that of the
hardest working man in foot-
ball history--another Payton:
The great, and unfortunately

the “Everyperson” should win
Emmys. Actually, can one win
an Emmy by starring in a com-
mercial?

Manning also seems like a
great son and a great brother:
I like that. Dungy is all class
and character. If it is true that
“one’s character is one’s des-
tiny”--as my favorite fortune
cookie message attests-—then
Dungy’s fate is sealed. He’s

Men lose pair of heartbreakers T

at home in front of big crowds

By Kevln Trempe
surr WRITER

Plagued by missed free throws
down the stretch and a defense
keying on star forward Greg Bi-
enemann, Washington and Lee’s
men’s basketball team suffered a
heartbreaking loss to 24th-ranked
Guilford College on Wednesday,
falling in the ﬁnal second by a
score of 62-61. This devastat-
ing loss was not the ﬁrst for the
Generals in the last week, as the
team fell 70-64 to Roanoke Col-
lege on Saturday night, snapping
a ﬁve-game home winning streak
and forcing the Generals to wait
another game to clinch a spot in
the ODAC playoffs.

Though the game seemed
out of reach, the Generals had a
chance to pull off the upset when
star forward Greg Bienemann was
fouled with 0.3 seconds left in the
game, needing two free throws
for the win. After missing the
ﬁrst and sitting through a Guilford
timeout, Bienemann watched as
his second shot rimmed out ,and
the ﬁnal buzzer sounded.

1 Down eighteen points at half-
time to Guilford, W&L relied on
near-perfect three-point shooting
in the second half to eliminate the
deﬁcit in the ﬁnal minute, taking
a one-point lead with 40 seconds

to go. With the shot clock wind- ,

ing down, Guilford forward Eric
Belkoski hit a three-pointer to
give the Quakers a 62-61 lead.
Bienemann’s second miss was re-
bounded by a Guilford center, and
W&L fell just short of knocking
off its ﬁrst ranked opponent this
season.

Swimming splits
weekend contests

Men and women both beat Marymount but fall to Hopkins

By Michael Keenan
surr wrmsn

The Washington and Lee
men’s and women’s swimming
teams competed twice over the
weekend. They~traveled to take
on Marymount Friday evening
before continuing on to Baltimore
to swim Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity on Saturday.

“The Marymount meet on Fri-
day will be a very good test for
the women-they narrowly beat
Marymount at the F&M invita-
tional and this should be a very
close meet. The women have re-
ally been swimming well lately
and I ‘truly feel like they will rise
to the occasion and win the meet.
The men should have some good
races on Friday. but we are much
deeper than Marymount, so it will
give some of our freshmen an op-
portunity to lead the way,” said
Coach Joel Shinoﬁeld before the
meet.

As Shinoﬁeld predicted, the
women met the challenge and
emerged victorious by a score of
109-96. The women were led by
Susan Mahoney’s win in the 1000
free, Jessica Shaw’s ﬁrst place
ﬁnish in the 200 IM and Lind-
sey Strachan’s victory in the 100
back. The 200 medley relay and
200 free relays also notched ﬁrst
place ﬁnishes.

“There was so much more
energy between us than there’s
been at previous meets. We really
swam as a team. You could look

around during any race, and no
one was sitting down. We were
all on our feet cheering because
every race mattered,” said Jenna
Worsham.

“The win over Marymount has
come at the perfect time for the
women’s team,” said Captain Ab-
bie Sauter. “We have had an in-
credibly hard season which hasn’t
been easy on the team’s morale,
and we all knew that Marymount
would be a very close meet. We
had to pull together as a team in
order to come out with a win, and
although we have had diﬁiculty
all having great swims at once,
the team ﬁnally came together to
have a tremendous meet.”

“The win over Marymount
deﬁnitely boosted our conﬁdence
as we approach the time for the
conference meet. Our schedule
has been extremely difﬁcult this
season, so we haven’t won a meet
for some time now. This win as-
sures us that our abilities as a
team have not changed, and that
we have improved over the past
couple of months,” said Julianne
Miata.

Saturday’s meet against Hop-

kins offered the women’s team a
chance to swim against some of
the best in the country. Hopkins’
women’s team entered the meet
ranked 10"‘ in the country. This is
the sixth meet this season against
top-25 ranked teams for the wom-
en’s team.

“Swimming against so many
teams that are ranked in the top-
25 is tough to handle.  We actu-
ally prefer this schedule over an
easier one. Swimming against
more competitive teams means
that we will be much more pre-
pared for our races when we ﬁ-
nally swim Randolph Macon in
the conference championship,”
said Miata.

With only one dual meet re-
maining, the women are eagerly
looking forward to the ODAC
Championship Meet, in which
they hope to win their 14th con-
secutive ODAC title.

“While Randy Mac may have
a better record, we have had more
competition and more practice
with racing which deﬁnitely gives
us the edge. Watch out RM-C,

See “SWIMMING” on page 6

The loss dropped the Generals
to 10-7 on the season, with a 5-6
record against conference oppo-
nents.

The Roanoke game was never
out of reach for W&L. The Gen-
erals were down a point at half-
time, took a lead the ﬁrst posses-
sion of the second half and again
cut the deﬁcit to one to trail 65-
64 going into the ﬁnal minute of
the game. However, they would
be held scoreless for the remain-
der of the contest, and solid free-
throw shooting by the Maroons
was enough to seal the victory.
Bienemann, who had come into
the game averaging over 21 points
per game, was held to just nine by
a Roanoke defense, who relied on
double-coverage for much of the
night.

Despite the losses, it is clear
that basketball is back in Lex-
ington. At the annual Lip Sync
competition on Friday night, se-
nior co-captain Alex White took
the stage to thunderous applause,
encouraging students to come out
to the game the next evening. All
week, conversation around lunch
tables, classrooms and frat houses
touched on the quiet success of
the basketball team. And on Sat-
urday, despite a typical night of

O

mixers and parties around cam-Q

pus, 510 people showed up to
watch the Generals take on Roa-
noke, by far the highest home at-
tendance this season. At 10-7, the
Generals are off to their best start
in 17 years,

Said freshman John Twomey:
“This season has really exceeded
everyone’s expectations.”

Virginia Sen ate passes bill
to ban smoking in public
buildings, but decision

will rest with the House

 

smoking ban

By Wes O’Dell
STAFF WRITER

Wafﬂe House may soon lose
one of its deﬁning characteristics:
the smoke. As will the Palms,
Malones and virtually every other
“enclosed space frequented by the
public” if a bill making its way
through the Virginia General As-
sembly musters the votes it needs
to become law.

On Feb. 5, the Virginia State
Senate approved SB l16l—The
Smoke Free Air Act. Sponsored
by J. Brandon Bell 11 (R), the act
aims to forbid smoking in any
building used by the public.

According to the General
Assembly's Legislative Infor-
mation System, the bill would
exempt privately owned homes,
residences and automobiles as
well as certain hotel rooms and
tobacco-related business. The bill
will now go to the House for con-
sideration.

Sen. Bell represents the 22nd
Senate District, which is south of
Lexington and includes all of B0-
tetourt County, all of the Cities of
Radford and Salem and parts of
Montgomery and Roanoke Coun-
ties.

According to his website, the
senator believes “all workers
have the right to breathe clean
air. Secondhand smoke is not just
an annoyance. It is dangerous...
While I respect the right of pri-

vate business to make their own
choices, the public health con-
cerns are substantial and must be
addressed.” _

Bell is no stranger to public
health issues; according to vapap.
org, a website tracking money in
Virginia politics, the healthcare
industry has contributed more
money than any other industry to
the “Bell for Senate” campaign in
the current cycle.

If passed, this bill could have a
signiﬁcant effect on commerce at
the local level, as it would effec-
tively outlaw smoking sections in
restaurants and bars.

Cindy Campbell, President
and General Manager of The
Palms restaurant, would actually
welcome the change. “I’d love for
it to pass,” she said.

She pointed out that the major-
ity of The Palms is non-smoking
already (70 percent non-smok-
ing), and that the restaurant often
has a full non-smoking section
and an empty smoking section.

Campbell attributes this in
large part to a decrease in the
number of students that smoke,
particularly law students.

She also believes the bills
passage would allow her to en-
sure a healthy atmosphere for her
staff, customers and herself while
providing a “level playing ﬁeld”
so The Palms would not be at a
competitive disadvantage by go-
ing smoke-free.

Virginia considers joining other states with smoking bans :

r, .

The ban would likely change
little at W&L; university tobacco
policies already forbid smoking
indoors.  for fraternity houses,
University General Counsel Le-
anne Shank indicated the “private
residences" exemption seems to
exclude them.

Of course, the bill must still
overcome a long history of oppo-

sition in the House from commer-
cial interests such as the Virginia
Hospitality and Travel Associa-
tion and the Virginia tobacco in-
ClllSl1'_V. A similar bill in the pre-
vious session died in a House
subconnnittee after achieving
Senate approval. The bill received
two additional votes this year.
The Lexington-Rockbridge

Chamber of Connnerce declined
to take a position on the issue and
indicated that the State Chamber
has not taken a stance either.

Virginia Governor Timothy
Kaine (D) has expressed opposi-
tion to the bill, citing its provi-
sions as overly broad.

He instead supports a narrow-
er ban for restaurants and other

offenses.

proposed smoking ban:

- Would forbid smoking in buildings or
enclosed areas used by the public.

- Exceptions would be made for private
homes. residences. automobiles and .
home—based businesses.

- Specialty tobacco stores and tobacco
manufacturers would also be exempt.

- Smoking in a prohibited area is
punishable by a $100 fine for a first

offense and a $250 fine for subsequent

public facilities. Kaine himself
recently signed an order prohibit-
ing smoking in all state govem-
ment offices, common areas and
vehicles occupied by the execu-
tive branch.

The bill is currently awaiting
hearings in a House subcommit-
tee dealing with alcohol and gain-
bling.

Mock Trial preps for nationals

Two squadsﬁrom W&L is three—year—old team will compete in March at nationals in Minneapolis

By Sacha Raab
STAFF WRITER

hile most of the Wash-
ington and Lee com-
munity is preparing

for midtenns and trying to make
it through the long and dreary
winter term, the Mock Trial team
is intensifying its practices in
preparation for Nationals, its larg-
est competition thus far.

The weekend of March 17,
while fraternities and sororities
are organizing St. Patrick’s Day
parties, two of W&L’s Mock Trial
teams will be heading to Minne-
apolis, Minn. to compete against
some of the best teams in the na-
tion. Team A, captained by David
Mitchell, is comprised of Eugina
Huang, Thadeous Larkin, Pearse
Davidson, Sarah Atkinson, Erin

Coltrera and Bill Larson.

Walker Humphrey is captain
of Team B, which includes Chris-
tine Giordano, Emily Lurie, Andy
Budzinski, Dane Davis, Emily
DeVoe, Alex Caritis and Kelly
Bundy.

At the start of fall term, the
teams laid the groundwork for
the case of the year and practiced
about two times per week. Each
practice lasts approximately two
hours and takes place at the Law
School.

Aﬁer going over the case, theo-
ries and themes, the team decided
on witnesses and began practic-
ing cross-examinations and direct
questioning. Finally, the teams
rehearsed the actual case.

The teams now focus on one
or two aspects of the trial, choos-
ing from openings, closings, di-

“7 he greatest diﬂerence between National and

Regional competition is that there are no bad

teams there. The deadwood s been cutaway. ”

DAVID GREENE, Mock Trial Assistant Coach

rect questioning or cross-exami-
nations. By this point in the year,
they are primarily ﬁne-tuningtheir
work and increasing the depth of
their cross-examinations.

With Nationals looming
ahead, their practices are becom-
ing more intense and focused.

‘The coach and assistant coaches

work with the team on improving
their adaptability to a more so-
phisticated case, which they will
likely see during the competition

in Minneapolis.

David Greene, an assistant
coach who graduated from the
University of Tennessee and is
in his third year at the W&L law
school, said, “The greatest differ-
ence between National and Re-
gional competition is that there
are no bad teams there. The dead-
wood’s been cutaway.”

Sophomore Allie Zeger, who
attended Nationals last year, talk-
ed about competing.

“My favorite part of competi-
tion is seeing how well the team
works together,” Zeger said.
“Everybody is very excited and
works very hard. People really
step up their performances and
come through for the team.”

The greatest challenge the
teams will face at Nationals con-
cerns case changes. One or two
witnesses will be added to the
case, which will result in more
facts. These could either slightly
or greatly affect the case.

There are two levels within
Nationals. The top two or three
teams in regional competition go
straight to Gold Nationals, which
takes place in St. Petersburg,
Florida in early April.

The top six or so teams go to
Silver Nationals. Silver Nation-

als takes placein Minneapolis

and in Chicago in March. The
highest placing teams in Silver
Nationals will then go on to Gold
Nationals.

Mitchell and Greene discussed
their goals for the competition
in Minneapolis. They plan on
attempting to qualify for Gold
Nationals. While qualifying for
Silver Nationals is impressive,
making it to St. Peteisburg would
greatly raise the team ’s stature.

Greene said about the teams:
“I’m pretty proud of them. I’m
optimistic for the upcoming com-
petition, because we have a lot
of people on the teams who have
been doing this for the past three
years. I’m even more optimistic
for the future, because the team
is heavily populated by freshmen
and sophomores, and we have
some very bright people.”

China .

Washington Post reporter John Pomfret will discuss China and his time there as a reporter

By Dane Davls
STAFF WRITER

he Washington and Lee
I community will host dis-
tinguished author and
Washington Post reporter John
Pomfret on Feb. 27. His sched-
uled talk is titled “Chinese Les-
sons” and will detail his seven
years as a reporter working in
China.

Pomfret will explore and dis-
cuss themes presented in his re-
cently published book “Chinese
Lessons: An American, Five
Classmates and the Story of the
New China.”

The book is an account of his
lengthy stay in China and the inti-
mate relationships he formed with
individuals from almost every
section of Chinese society.

“Chinese Lessons” has earned
widespread acclaim from the Wall
Street Journal, New York Times
and other major reviewers.

Pomfret has long-standing ex-
perience with journalism and Chi-

 ‘:7-~

 

‘‘[Modern China] is all money orientea’.

get anything here. ’

Literature

na. Aside from being Los Angeles
Bureau Chief for The Washington
Post, Pomfret has over ﬁfteen
years of journalistic experience.
He has covered the 1989 Tianan-
men Square protests and conﬂicts
in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Congo,
Sri Lanka, Iraq, southwestern
Turkey and northeastern Iran.

The talk will relate his expe-
riences in China to the country’s
changing role in the world of eco-
nomics and politics.

Hongchu Fu, Associate Pro-
fessor of East Asian Languages
and Literature, said that China
today has overwhelmingly em-
braced capitalism and Western
culture.

Fu goes said that modern Chi-
na “is all money oriented. People
can get houses; they can virtually
get anything here.”

This is a radical change from
the widespread poverty that en-
trenched China for most of the
twentieth century. During the
1900s China fought a long and
bloody war with Japan before and
during World War II.

The country then fought a civ-
il war that led to the communist
takeover in 1949.

The government has allowed 0

more freedom in recent years, but
the press is still tightly regulated.

Fu said, “Everywhere you go,
you can see traditional Chinese

architecture being replaced by
Western buildings.”

This radical transformation of
China from a developing country
to an emerging world power has
created conﬂicts between Chinese

culture and Western culture. Fu'

cites the example of the Forbid-
den City, preserved and oﬁ‘-limits
to the general public for hundreds
of years. Now the palace complex
is open to tourists and is the home
of a Starbucks.

It is within this context Pomfret
wrote “Chinese Lessons.” The
story begins with his years as a

student at Nanjing University in ‘

the early 1980s. While at Nanjing
University, he met and befriend-

ed people that later became Red

Guards, villagers, businessmen,
and dissidents.

Characters in Pomfret’s book
include “Idiot Zhou, the widow
Little Guan, the sad sack Old Wu,
the feckless dissident Daybreak
Song, and Party apparatchik Big
Bluffer Ye.”

Mr. Pomfret will also visit
classes during his stay.

, Looking for a new view

A local resident encourages the university to restore downtown Lexington is view of the Colonnade

@

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

s Washington and Lee
prepares its new Master
Plan, at least one local

resident wants the plan to improve
views of the historic Colonnade.

William de Laat moved to
Lexington six months ago after
he retired from a job at the Ca-
nadian Embassy in Washington,
D.C. He ﬁrst learned about the
master plan during a presentation
by Joe Grasso, W&L’s Vice Presi-
dent for Administration and one
of the principal designers of the
proposed plans.

“As an outsider I probably
see things differently than some-
one who has lived here for a long
time,” de Laat said.

Some people feel the

wall is a nice border

to the campus; other

people think it means
‘keep out. ”

JOE GRASSO, Vlce-President
of Administration
 

De Laat’s main concern with
the plan was an initial proposal
to build new buildings at the cor-
ner of Washington and Jefferson
streets.

Grasso said W&L has backed
away from any plan to build on
that comer, but de Laat still hopes
the university will ﬁnd a way to
partially clear the views from that
comer and make the Colonnade
visible from downtown Lexing-
ton. '

Grasso said the current ver-
sion of the master plan calls for
the corral parking lot to remain in
place.

“As a newcomer — a prospec-
tive student, parents or tourists
— you come into town and there

is really no formal entrance to the
campus,” de Laat said.

“While the Lee Chapel Me-
morial entrance is attractive, it
doesn’t draw one’s eyes to the
Colonnade and great lawn,” de
Laat said in an open letter to Gras-
so and President Ken Ruscio.

In his letter, de Laat outlined
several several other suggestions
that he said would make the cam-
pus more accessible to visitors as
well as create a dramatic view of
the Colonnade. His ﬁrst proposal
is to remove the red brick wall
currently running along Jefferson
and Washington streets.

De Laat also suggested that
the school remove the Red House,
which currently houses most of
the East Asian Studies depart-
ment, as well as some of the trees
and parking lots around the cor-
ner in question.

He suggested replacing the
lost parking with an underground
garage at the comer of Washing-
ton and Jefferson.

That garage, he said in his let-
ter, could then have an open park
or plaza built on top that would
help create a sweeping view of
the Colonnade from downtown
Lexington.

“The general idea is that this
be open and accessible to the city
instead of walled off, because it
is walled off now,” de Laat said.
“To preserve not just those build-

-ings but the view of them would

be great.”

Grasso said the Board of Trust-
ees just approved the proposed lo-
cation for a new Center for Jewish
Life. That building will be built
on Washington Street right next
to R.E. Lee Episcopal Church.
Fundraising will begin soon for
that project.

While Grasso said the board
has approved some parts of the
plan, the entire proposal will not
be approved until the May board
meeting. He did say that the
school was continuing to study
proposals along Jefferson Street
and for the corner in question.

“We don’t know what we
should do with the [brick] wall,”

 

JACOB GEIGER / Manging Editor

Though downtown Lexington used to have a’ sweeping vlew of the Colonnade, that vlew Is now largely blocked by
trees In the corral parking lot. The brlck wall at the corner of Washington and Jefferson was bullt In the 19905.

Grasso said. “Some people feel
the wall is a nice border to the
campus; other people think it
means ‘keep out.”’

Grasso said he believes the
brick wall was built during the
early 1990s, when John Wilson
was president of W&L.

In a letter that will run in
the Rockbridge Weekly, Grasso
agreed with de Laat’s suggestion
that the school work with Lexing-
ton to improve the views along
Jefferson Street. Grasso’s letter
said that placing utilities under-
ground and improving surround-
ing sidewalks would “be long

term investments in the attractive-
ness of downtown Lexington.”

De Laat said that while much
of the master plan is still under
consideration, he wanted the
school to at least consider the
concept of a formal entrance to
the school.

“People, when they think about
the school’s mission, rightly thing
of the academic requirements
of the university,” de Laat said.
“But when you’re in a small city
and custodians of a National His-
toric Site, it’s incumbent on you
to consider other factors » and I
know that the school does.”

Venezuela article
lacks some context

Arguments against Venezuela is leader poor: unbalanced ,

comments and concerns
about Abel Delgado’s article
“The Demise of Democracy.”
First let me begin by saying
that, in general, I felt that the
article was in some ways vague,
at one point unfair/incorrect and
overall tended to misrepresent
and misunderstand a large portion
of many of Venezuela’s issues.
A few points:

I just thought I’d offer a few

1. In reference to the line,
“giving the dictator, I mean presi-
dent”, Chavez is the democrati-
cally elected leader of his coun-
try.

He was elected in what were
deemed to be fair elections, which
represented the majority will of
the people.

Yes, his actions have made the
form of government more author-
itarian, but he is not a dictator.

2. The classiﬁcation of Ven-
ezuela as “the birthplace of the
new and improved militant left”
is incorrect, mostly because
Chavez’s government is not a
military regime.

The military does have a role
in carrying out social programs
but the government itself is inde-
pendent of the military and in no
way involves itself in governmen-
tal or political affairs.

2.5 A few small points on the
paragraph about nationalizing the
entire energy sector.

How does this paragraph at all
present evidence that the policy it-
self is not meant to help the poor.

Bringing industries under state

control is usually done as some
part of a larger redistribution of
wealth across the country, largely
intended to help the poor.

Despite this point, yes,
Chavez’s policies have done little
to help the poor, but the overall
argument made as to why is poor.

3. With respect to the follow-
ing; “He has continually meddled
in other Latin American elec-
tions.”

This is referring to exactly
what election, when, where?

Is it referring to Chavez been
a vocal supporting of other leﬁist
leaders or candidates in the re-
gion, much the same way a Presi-
dent here might throw his weight
behind his preferred candidate?

Or is it possible referring to
the Nicaraguan election where
former leftist Sandinista leader
Daniel Ortega was fairly and
freely elected by the‘ people of his
country, and whom Chavez con-
gratulated on the victory.

4. I would like to see where
the author got his information on
Chavez calling for “a uniﬁed Lat-
in American military similar to
NATO, only under his control.”

What I do know is that [the fol-
lowing is taken from the website
www.cfr.org/publication/11285/
hugo_chavezs_world_tour.htrnl]
Chavez has called for the spread
of what he calls a “Bolivarian
Revolution.”

This would be the uniting of
Latin America under a uniﬁed
system similar to that of the Eu-
ropean Union.

That union however, is found-

ed more so on the basic of eco-
nomic power and not on military
alliances or groups.

In order to conclude I would
like to add another point or two.

The proportion to which the
Venezuelan “threat” is expounded
and presented in this article is
ﬂawed and unbalanced.

And ﬁnally, if you are going to
examine Chavez’s inﬂuence in or
threat to region, you have to look
at his actions and policies within a
broader Latin American context.

The leftist movements are split
into two.

To quote Jorge G. Castaneda
“One is modern, open-minded, re-
formist, and intemationalist, and
it springs, paradoxically, from the
hard-core left of the past.

The other, born of the great
tradition of Latin American popu-
lism, is nationalist, strident, and
close-minded.”

(www.foreignaffairs.org/
2006050lfaessay85302/jorge-g-
castaneda/latin-america-s—leﬁ-«
tum.htrnl).

It is to this second group that
Chavez belongs, but understand-
ing the affects inside and outside
of Venezuela would be hard with-
out a deeper understanding of
the roots of his and other leftist
movements in Latin America.

I appreciate you listening to
my comments and concerns and
please feel free to contact me if
you wish.

It has been another busy
week for the W&L rumor
mill.

As the Inter-Fratemity

' Council launches another in-
vestigation of pledgeship — or
New Member Education, as
the school would like it to be
called — rumors are ﬂying.

In the span of one or two
hours, fratemities have been
convicted then exonerated,
kicked off campus and then
rehabilitated.

The IFC and school ad-
ministration probably can’t
work that fast, but the rumor
mill can. Which fraternities
were under investigation?
All of them? Just a few? .

The rumor mill keeps try-
ing to answer these questions,
but a different answer comes
around every hour.

Everyone claims to have

heard — directly from a reli-
able friend on the IFC, of
course — exactly who will be
punished and who is in the
clear.

Butinstead of keeping stu-
dents informed of the devel-
oping events, the IF C sent out
yet another broadcast e-mail
that essentially says nothing
other than “everyone be good

and behave yourselves.”

feditorial

IFC must silence
rumors with facts

Public disclosure can put a stop to wild rumors

W&L’s hazing policies
seem relatively straightfor-
ward, but their enforcement
is anything but clear. Who
does handle enforcement and
disciplinary issues? The IFC
or the Student Affairs Com-
mittee?

During our last issue we
used this same space to dis-
cuss how the school could
build and maintain strong
relationships with the student
media. We said that the ad-
ministration usually does a
good job of maintaining open
lines of communication.

And while what we said is
still true, it is disappointing
that the school has not chosen
to be more open about the on-
going investigations.

The recent IFC investiga-
tions are far more important
that school-press relations.
These recent meetings could
decide the fate of entire fra-
ternities and the people — both
brothers and pledges — who
belong to them.

They could decide if
sophomores will stay in their
houses or be forced to move
out. They will determine
if freshmen have been go-
ing through a legitimate new
member education or inap-

propriate hazing.

When the stakes are this
high, should the rumor mill
be allowed to rule?

The IFC is wielding con-
siderable power right now,
and with that power comes a
responsibility to provide in-
formation about the ongoing
cases. The council does not
need to release its preliminary
investigations, but it should
move quickly to release its
ultimate ﬁndings.

In a perfect world the IFC
would have more time to con-
duct its investigations before
taking action, but W&L is not
always a perfect world. Since
rumors are going to keep
swirling, the IFC must pro-
vide some facts to the entire
community.

If sanctions are going to
be handed out, they should
be publicly announced, not
simply delivered to the presi-
dent of a house. If a house is
investigated and found inno-
cent, that should also be an-
nounced.

With a few simple e-mails,
the IFC can push the rumor
mill into the background and
let facts rule the discussion.

Enough whispering. Share
the facts. -

Texas governor has mandated the HPVvaccine for female sixth—graders

By Cody Beauchamp
coLu M NIST

On Feb. 3, Texas Governor
Rick Perry issued an executive or-
der that will require Texas school-
girls to get vaccinated against the
human papillomavirus (HPV), a
sexually-transmitted virus that
has been shown to cause cervical
cancer.

Perry, Bush’s hand-picked suc-
cessor as governor of Texas—and
one of the staunchest of conser-
vatives—sidestepped the Repub-
lican-controlled legislature with
the use of the executive order.

In doing so, he sidestepped
conservative religious and par-
enting groups that would have
certainly protested had the issue
been given a chance to be debated
on the ﬂoor of the statehouse.

In other words, Perry decided
to ignore powerful religious con-
servatives and implement a law
that will greatly reduce a deadly
STI’s prevalence in the second
most populated state in America.

Attaboy, Rick!

Let me say this—-norrnally I’m
not much of a Perry fan. As much
as I abhor the man as president,
I’ll admit that Perry’s predecessor
(a little-known “decider” named
George Bush) really was a good
governor. No, really.

Perry, on the other hand, is an-
other story.

On his watch, multiple special
sessions of the Texas legislature
have failed to reach any good
solution to a critically important
school ﬁnance debate (namely,
for all you non-Texans, “how the

According to critics, immunizing
Texas girls against ST Is will some-
how increase promiscuity.

heck are we going to pay for our
schools?”).

He has used his veto power a
record number of times for a Texas
governor. He has been criticized
nonstop in the state for being very
partisan. He is not, normally, the
kind of guy who disagrees with
Texas’ (many, many, many) reli-
gious conservatives.

Yet, in a bold move, Perry or-
dered the HPV vaccinations.

What’s bold is he did it by
way of executive order, meaning
that the powerful religious con-
servative groups that would have
torpedoed any bill mandating
vaccinations had it gone through
the legislature had no say in the
process.

Thanks, Rick.

The arguments of the religious
conservatives against the vac-
cinations are pretty lackluster to
begin with. Supposedly, accord-
ing to critics, immunizing Texas
girls against STIs will somehow
increase promiscuity and the like-

lihood they will have sex.

However, the vaccinations as
Perry ordered them will be given
predominantly to ll- and 12-year-
old girls. I highly doubt that most
11- or 12-year old girls are think-
ing seriously about sex.

0

If they are (I can’t really as-
certain that information without
asking some Christopher Walken-
level creepy questions), I can
promise you very, very, few boys
their age are. So, while the vac-
cines may put the thought into
their heads, most won’t be able
act on it until another few years,
by which time sex is on the mind
anyway.

Another argument critics of
the HPV vaccination have is that
ordering the vaccine eliminates
parents from the picture, takes
away a choice they have in how
to raise their children.

Fine, I’ll concede that manda-
tory vaccination does that. But,
why then is no one crying foul
over mandatory polio shots? How
about whooping cough vaccines?
Measles? Mumps?

There’s a battery of vaccina-
tions that most parents are willing
to allow their children to receive
because they know that getting
the vaccinations will protect their
children against horrible diseas-
es.

When they were mandated, the
vaccines fought what were very
real threats to public health, and
the vaccination campaigns have
put real dents in the prevalence of

all the illnesses.

Why, then, are we so scared
to ﬁght an STI in the same way
we’ve fought any of the above
diseases?

The answer can be broken
down into three letters — “s,” “e,”
and “x.” Texas religious conser-
vatives don’t like talking openly
about sex.

They don’t want their children
to know anything about it, other
than that it’s one of the most hor-
rible decisions you can make, un-

less you’re making it with a ring ’

on your ﬁnger and to the love oi
your life.

As a Methodist by birth, a
Baptist by faith, and the native 01
a pretty zealously religious town,
I understand that argument.

I don’t entirely agree, but 1 un-
derstand.

But for the good of society,
I’m glad that Perry-—another re-
ligiously-raised, small—town Tex-
an—decided to grow up and face
the music.

Much to the dismay of faith-
ful Christians, people have sex
out of wedlock; girls having sex
can contract a life-threatening vi-
rus; there is a vaccine available
that could prevent almost all girls
from contracting HPV.

Perry, as governor of Texas,
went against his staunchest politi-
cal supporters and even his own
extremely conservative personal
faith.

He did the practical and prag-
matic thing, and likely will save
many Texas girls from HPV.

Maybe he’s not so bad after ‘

all.

“Oscar and Felix” presented a
delightful version ofNeil Simon’s
“The Odd Couple” last weekend
in the Lenfest Center. The play
successfully captured the hilarity
of two opposites forced to live
under the same roof, keeping the
audience laughing until the last
applause.

The cast portrayed the time-
less characters of Simon’s comic
genius well. Noticeable among
the performances was senior
Lauren Kampf’s Ynez, the Sexy
Spaniard who ﬂirts with Oscar
and Felix. Everything in Kampf’s
delivery was top notch, from her
Spanish accent to her over-the-

top boisterous behavior.

The highlight of the evening
undoubtedly was junior Wil-
liam Holliday’s portrayal of neat
freak Felix Unger set against ju-
nior Charles Barbour’s depiction
of slob Oscar Madison.

Holliday superbly embodied
the prim and prissy Felix, never
breaking form and delivering his
lines with a humor and believ-
ability that would have done Si-
mon proud. Barbour played the
gruff, good-for-nothing Oscar
with a charisma and comedy that
really made his character come
to life.

According to Barbour, the
best thing about being part of a
cast of such timeless characters
is Neil Simon’s hilarity.The
play also excelled in highlight-
ing the subtle themes of Simon’s

  

THE RING-TUM PHI '

  Performers dazzle audiences
in Lenfest Center with comical
presentation of Simon classic

work. The “new look” at the Odd
Couple drew attention to issues
of sexuality and society’s no-
tions about them. This added to
the comedy while also question-
ing the themes of Simon’s play.

The actors did a good job of
layering their roles, adding a
meaningﬁil tone to the humor of
Oscar and Felix’s dysfunctional
relationship. Attention to these
details of the comedy made the
show truly satisfying.

Such a fantastic production
of a classic speaks to the quality
of Washington and Lee’s theater
program, a program which often
gets overlooked in the myriad
of other disciplines offered at
W&L.

“The W&L theater department
has grown tremendously. More
and more people are getting in-
volved, and the faculty treats you
like family,” Barbour said.

“It’s an unusual experience
because the department sees
every side of you - not just the
good tidy student go-to-class
smile and drink coffee side - but
also the messed up hair, pissed
off and I’m about to go mental
side. But they still put up with

you. It’s a beautiful thing,” Bar-
bour continued

The beauty of the students’
commitment to theater and their
talents was indeed evidenced
in their outstanding production
of the play. Overall, the show
was received well by the crowd
and was a pleasure to watch the
whole way through. What a way

  Clubs venture nationwide

Several students will spend Feb. break serving impoverished or exploring exotic wildlife

By Queenie Wong
STAFF WRITER

For one week, members of
the Nabors Service League, Bon-
ner Leaders Program and Outing
Club will venture into different
worlds. Away from the familiar
Lacoste polo shirts and blue blaz-
ers of this campus, each club will
kick off its Washington Break
by tackling issues ranging from
homelessness to surviving in the
Wilderness. The NSL will travel
to Houston, Texas; the Bonner
Leaders Program to Immokalee,
Florida; and the Outing Club to
Everglades, Florida.

The NSL started organizing its
trip alter a Washington and Lee
alumnus working for Teach for
America in New Orleans moved
to Houston, said Micaela Coffey,
NSL’s Alternative Breaks Chair.
Following ‘Hurricane Katrina,
the alum asked for help on the
Knowledge is Power Program
(KIPP) school that was granted
an emergency charter after the
hurricane.

NSL, which is sending 15 stu-
dents on the trip, will work with
SEARCH, a nonproﬁt organiza-
tion helping 14,000 of Houston’s
homeless, Coffey said. The Hous-
ton Alumni Association is spon-
soring the trip.

“It’s so comforting, as a stu-
dent, to see how generous the
W&L alums are,” Colfey said.
“That they care so much about
current students means a lot to me
and is yet another reason that I’m
proud to be a W&L student.”

NSL is holding a fundraiser
this Thursday at Frank’s from 5-
10 p.m. 20 percent of the restau-
rant’s proﬁts will go towards the
$100 fee for the Houston trip, said
Sonia Siu, NSL’s General Chair.

While the NSL helps the home-
less, 11 ﬁrst-year Bonner leaders
will be tackling a different issue:
rural poverty. Immokalee, Florida
is an agricultural district which
functions as a hub for low wage
workers, said Bonner Leader Pro-
gram Director Sandra Hayslette.-

“This trip humanizes the is-
sue of poverty and low wages by
coming face to face with these
problems,” she said.

According to Hayslette, the
trip contains both a community
service and educational aspect.
The leaders will perform services
ranging from helping Harvest for
Humanity create affordable hous-
ing to talking to the Rural Legal
Service and the Coalition of Im-
mokalee Workers. Hayslette es-
timates that Bonner leaders will
accomplish at least eight hours of
community service each day. She

also hopes, following the trip, that
leaders will be able to analyze and
compare their lives to the lives of
Immokalee residents.

“I think one thing students will
get from this trip is a lot of food
for thought—no pun intended,”
she said.

Because the trip is fully spon-
sored by the Bonner Foundation,
participants will be staying at the
Immokalee Friendship House, a
homeless shelter, where they will
share meals and converse with
residents.

This is the ﬁrst time the Bon-
ner Leaders Program created a
trip for ﬁrst-year members.

In another part of Florida, the
Everglades, 13 Outing Club mem-
bers will ﬁnd themselves kayak-
ing through mangrove islands and
camping on beaches, Outing Club
Director James Dick said. This is
the 13th year the Outing Club has
participated in this trip.

“I ﬁgured it’s a chance to learn
something new and get away from
all the cliche trips and vacations,”
said sophomore Allison Gionta,
who is attending the trip.

According to Dick, the partici-
pants will cook their own meals
and carry their own kayak gear.
They will also have a former park
ranger and a commercial ﬁsher-
man guiding them throughout the

America’s #1 law school
for trial advocacy is in sunny

Tampa Bay, Florida.

trip, which costs $550 per mem-

Students will come face to face

white pelican and osprey. Dick
also said that Catarina Passido-

aginas are for lovers. Or

so the t-shirts say. The

Vagina Monologues
are back. This is the third per-
formance of the monologues at
Washington and Lee, sponsored
by the Women’s Law Students
Organization.

Previously, the organization
sponsored the show every other
year, but the leadership decided
to try an annual performance af-
ter the success of the last year’s
show.

The Vagina Monologues are
performed on college campuses
every year around Valentine’s
Day to raise awareness about
women’s issues, from sexual
misconduct and violence against
women worldwide, to everyday
things like going to the gynecolo-
gist.

“It’s a really good way to get
things on the table,” said Crystal
Teed, a ﬁrst-year law student and ;
one of over twenty women from
the law school, undergraduate

“T he heart of the production is real wom-

en Ls voices being heard I get to bring out

the superstar in me. It is for any woman who

has ever felt uncomfortable. ’

YVONNE COKER, Junlor partlclpant
 

school, and the faculty at W&L

performing this year. “It breaks

down barriers in a really con-
structive way.”

Teed did not know much about
the monologues before she saw
an advertisement for auditions
in the law school. Coming from

y a performing arts family, she

wanted a creative outlet to offset
her schoolwork. After the ﬁrst
read through of the script with the
other actors, she was hooked.
“It’s a very introspective pro-
cess,” she said. “The play really
tries to tap into every woman.”
Each monologue focuses on a
dilferent aspect of being a wom-

an, often exploring transitive pe-
riods in life and sensitive aspects
of relationships.

The value of the monologues
also creates the controversy sur-
rounding them, because they are
written in a way that is very up
front and edgy.

E’Lon Cohen, an undergradu-
ate senior, knew exactly what she
was getting into.

She has seen the monologues

on stage twice and decided to au- .

dition thﬁ year after she was con-
vinced to by a friend.
“It gives me a way to show
me,” she said about her piece.
She said that women tend to

freeze up when asked about con-
troversial issues, and this was a
chance for her to step out of her
comfort zone and be able to show
an aspect of herself that most peo-
ple might not see.

Yvonne Coker, an undergradu-
ate junior, also decided to audition
after seeing the show last year.

She was attracted by the idea
that the actresses did not need to
have prior experience i11 order to
get involved.

“The heart of the production
is real women’s voices being
heard,” she said.

“I get to bring out the superstar
in me. It’s for any woman who
has ever felt uncomfortable.”

Each year a new monologue is
written to spotlight a different is-
sue around the world.

Last year, the monologue was
about the plight of the Vietnam-
ese “comfort women” exploited
as prostitutes by the Japanese
military during World War II.

This year, due to the increase
in violence against women and
girls that occurs in time of war,
the spotlight issue is women in

conﬂict zones.

The campaign is motivated by
recent conﬂicts in Sudan, Congo,
and Iraq. It is aimed at making
sure the issue of sexual violence
remains in the media even though
the conﬂicts at hand might seem
commonplace because of their

‘ frequency.

For the women involved in the
production at W&L, it is about
carrying that message but also
about raising awareness here.

“Lexington is a small town,”
Teed said.

“We don’t always talk about
certain things. Hopefully, this
will give people an opportunity
to feel connected and everyone
will come away with something
different."

“It‘s fun and difficult,” said
Coker about her acting experience
so far. “But the fact that I want to
be excellent motivates me.”

The Vagina Monologues will
be performed this Thursday and
Friday in the Troubadour The-
ater.

Tickets will be available in ad-
vance or at the door.

Wrestling

The Washington and Lee wrestling
team has been unstoppable in re-
cent weeks, posting a 3-0 record
and defeating the top two teams
in the Centennial Conference.
Saturday morning, the Generals
defeated Newport News Ap-
prentice School, 21-15. With the
victory, the Generals improve to
8-3, which is the most wins that the
team has posted in a season since
the 1986-1987 campaign, when it
went 9-5. Juniors David Shubick
and Jesse Sataloff and freshman
Sammy Brusca all registered wins
in the meet. Two weekends ago,
W&L posted a pair of huge up-
sets over the top two teams in the
Centennial Conference. The Gen-
erals captured a 21-17 decision
over previously-undefeated 30th
ranked Ursinus and then claimed
a 18-16 triumph over Muhlen-
berg. With the win, the Generals
also snapped Ursinus’ 27-match
unbeaten streak in conference
action. Both of the victories were
not decided until the heavyweight
bout. Against Muhlenberg, the
Generals were trailing by a point
when sophomore John Christopher
defeated his opponent 3-2 to clinch
the victory for the Generals. In the
Ursinus match, the teams were
tied going into the ﬁnal match, but
Christopher defeated his opponent

l“"m‘:"",6’-_5 to give W&L a victory. Peter
 Iéawrerice, Sataloﬂ‘ and Anthony

Boniello were also undefeated on
the day. The Generals return to
the mat on Saturday when they
compete in the Centennial Confer-
ence Championships hosted by
Gettysburg College at 11 a.m.

Women's Indoor Track
The Washington and Lee men’s
and women’s indoor track and
ﬁeld teams had eight ﬁrst—place
finishes, set six school records
and had two athletes qualify for
nationals against Division I,II and
III opponents this past weekend
at the Bucknell Winter Classic.
The W&L women broke a school
record three times over in the same
event when sophomore Jackie
Burns ﬁnished third overall and
ﬁrst among D-III runners in the
mile. Burns shaved over seven
seconds off the previous school
record. In that same race, sopho-
mores Becca Taylor and Elizabeth
Webb also broke the same school
record, ﬁnishing fourth and ﬁfth
overall, respectively. Webb also
crossed the ﬁnish line ﬁrst overall
in the 800—meters. Freshman Mag-
gie Sutherland broke two school
records single-handedly and ﬁn-
ished ﬁrst overall in the high jump.
She broke her own school record
with a leap of 5’5.0.” Sutherland’s
height was also an NCAA Provi-
sional Qualifying Standard. She
also broke her own school record
in the 55-meter hurdles and ﬁn-
ished third among D—III runners.
Sophomore Stacy Doombos ﬁn-
ished ﬁrst overall in the long jump,
also breaking her own school
record. With a jump of l7’9.75”,
Doombos’ performance was‘ also
an NCAA Provisional Qualifying
Standard. Additionally, Doombos
set a new school record in the
200-meters, ﬁnishing ﬁrst among
D-III athletes. The Generals return
to action on Saturday when they
participate in the Virginia Tech
Challenge.

Hunsinger sets record

Jessica Hunsinger sets a school
record for rebounds, but record
winning streak ends for Generals

By Madeline Gent
STAFF WRITER

On Tuesday, Feb. 6, Washing-
ton and Lee women’s basketball
achieved a feat it has never before
reached.

In the Warner Center, senior
Jessica Hunsinger became the
ﬁrst ever General to have pulled
down a thousand rebounds. Even
though the team lost to visiting
Guilford in a 72-66 overtime
decision, Hunsinger, the team’s
captain, had good reason to be
proud of her athletic performance
at W&L.

In fact, all of W&L has good
reason to be proud of Hunsinger,
as well as the entire women’s
team.

With a recent school-record
winning streak, or seven games
and an overall 12-10 record (8-
9 in ODAC play), this season
has proved to be one of the most
promising in recent memory for
the blue and white.

“The record is a nice thing to
brag about in front of the men’s
team,” said Hunsinger, “but I am
more excited about how well we
have been playing.”

Team effort aside, Hunsinger
has made herself a force to be
dealt with on the basketball court.
The three year letter-winner start-
ed oﬁ‘ her season ranked second
in school history with 168 career
blocks, third all-time with 779 re-
bounds and sixth in scoring with
1,118 points.

In the past 22 games, all of
which Hunsinger has started, she
has scored 276 points, making her
second in scoring to fellow team-
mate junior Kristen Krouchick,
leads the team in rebounding with
229 boards and has 76 blocks un-
der her belt — breaking her own
school record of 74.

Going into Tuesday night’s
game, Hunsinger said, “I wasn’t
anxious about [the thousand re-
bounds] mostly because people
told me I could do it. I don’t

really keep track of how many
rebounds I had or have. I didn’t
realize until I actually had it, but I
felt conﬁdent that this would hap-
pen eventually.”

The ofﬁcials stopped the clock
when Hunsinger hit her mark for
a brief moment of celebration.

“I was aware that Jess was
getting pretty close to the record,
although when they announced it
during the game, it was somewhat
of a surprise,” said junior team-
mate Emily Wolff.

“During the game, when she
pulled the thousandth rebound,
we stopped playing, and it was
announced that she had broken
the record. We all gave her hugs
and congratulations, but then con-
tinued playing.”

Hunsinger added, “They were
all very excited for me and they’ve
all been there all along the way
— four years of rebounding...so
much of it depends on what my
teammates were doing — whether
or not they were boxing out. It
was deﬁnitely a team effort.”

As for the celebration, she said
“it would have been better if we
won.”

With the season coming to an
end, Hunsinger’s achievement
proves the women still have some
ﬁght left to take to the ODAC
tournament.

“Not only is Jessica breaking
records, but the team is as well...
the record for most consecutive
wins,” said Wolﬁi

“It just shows that this year we
are determined to take it to the
next level and not settle for me-
diocrity.” -

On Tuesday, the women will
head to Hollins. Even with one
feat down, Hunsinger is just 14
rebounds away from another one
— the ODAC record for most re-
bounds in a career.

Whether you’re just going to
see history happen or just to cheer
on the women, the next few games
for W&L’s women’s basketball
team will be exciting to follow.

Pros look intolerant again

Some NBA stars look boorish and backwards as they criticize openly gay player

ByAdam Lewis
COLUMNISI

Alright, it’s time to tackle this
issue once and for all. Former
NBA center Joe Amaechi an-
nounced this week that he is gay,
surprising teammates, coaches
and fans, all of whom had little if
any suspicion regarding his sex-
ual orientation.
Following his

“coming out,”
players and
coaches from
around the
league began
making com-

 

ments, ranging
from the re-
spectful understanding of Amae-
chi’s position to the resentment
of his “secret,” which he had kept
quiet throughout his career. My
question is: Why the hell does it
matter?

1. Just because he happens
to be attracted to the male gen-
der does not mean that he is
suddenly going to hit on every

man he sees.

For some reason, this is a com-
mon occurrence in our society,
and is especially prevalent in all-
male organizations, such as the
army and the NBA. Regarding
this issue, NBA player Shavlik
Randolph (who, by the way, was
Duke—educated), made his view-
point clear: “As long as you don’t
bring your gayness on me I’m
ﬁne....I’m sure I could play with
him. But I think it would create a
little awkwardness in the locker
room.” Now tell me something,
Mr. Randolph. Do you have such
a high opinion of yourself that you
think anyone who likes men will
have the uncontrollable urge to
approach you in the locker room
with the intentions of asking you
on a date or touching you? Don’t
ﬂatter yourself; you don’t even
start on one of the worst teams
in the NBA. People need to un-
derstand that being gay does not
entail the inappropriate attraction
to all men. It’s that simple.

2. Statistics show that ho-
mosexuality (estimated to be

NBA commissioner David Stern said it best:

“We have a very diverse league. The question

at the NBA is always: ‘Have you got game? 

around 10 percent of the adult
population) is about as common
as being left-handed (estimated
to be around 8-15 percent of the
adult population).

Why then does society require
homosexuals to reveal this per-
sonal attribute to everyone, and
then shun them for having kept
it a secret? You don’t see lefties
going around declaring that they
write with their left hand, nor do
you see people gossiping about
the “lefty that came out of the
closet.” To me, this is just mind-
boggling. And I would like to
use a comment from the face of
the NBA, Lebron James, to fur-
ther my point: “With teammates
you have to be trustworthy, and if
you’re gay and you’re not admit-

ting that you are, then you are not
trustworthy.” I’m sorry, Lebron.
Did Joe Amaechi offend you by
not letting you in on his personal
life‘? Wow, I can’t imagine what
it would be like if one of your
teammates tells you he is a lefty.
Wouldn’t want to be that guy-he
would be so untrustworthy.

3. Being gay may imply many
things, but athletic ability is not
one of them.

As shown by Martina Navra-
tilova and Sheryl Swoopes, both
of whom are regarded as some of
the best players in their respective
sports, homosexuality does not
inhibit one’s athletic performance.
What really matters? As far as I
know, sports are about competi-
tion, entertainment and nowa-

days, money. If an athlete is able
to compete, entertain and make
money, why is sexual preference

even an issue? If he scores on '

the court, why does it matter who
he scores with after the game? It
doesn’t. NBA commissioner Da-
vid Stern said it best: “We have a
very diverse league. The question
at the NBA is always: ‘Have you
got game?”

As great as American sports
are, this is deﬁnitely something
that has got to change. There
have been only a handful oi
professional athletes to publicly
come out, and with the struggle
they have had to deal with, who
can blame those who haven’t? I
commend Joe Amaechi for tak-
ing the step that he did, and I can
only hope that in years to come.
the world of sports changes and
learns to acknowledge an ath-
lete’s performance, not his ori-
entation. To use the words of the
great Jerry Seinfeld: Joe Amaechi
is gay, “Not that there’s anything
wrong with that”—because there
most deﬁnitely isn’t.

THE RING-TUM PHI ° 9

Wrestling:

 Blue and White

slam opponents

Contlnued from page 12

The winning streak was not to
survive to 28 as the Generals, be-
hind the strength of sophomore
heavyweight John Christopher.

Christopher’s bouts were the
deciding factor in both match-
es. The Blue and White trailed
Muhlenberg 15-16 before the
Fort Lauderdale man took the mat
and topped the Mules.’ Joe Tartar;
likewise, W&L was tied with na-
tionally-ranked Ursinus before
Christopher’s win over Matt Wil-
liams. .

Both victories were by a single
point, and both handed the win to
the home side.

Generals wrestlers Peter Law-
rence and Anthony Boniello also
deserve a heavy dose of credit for
pins in the Ursinus match.

Lawrence, at 157 pounds, took
only two minutes and 13 seconds
to pin his opponent.

He, Boniello and Sataloﬁ were
undefeated on the day, losing nei-
ther against the Mules nor the
Bears.

_ The Generals’ threqwins bring

“their record to eightiwins and

three losses (5-2 in Centennial
Conference play).

This is W&L’s best record
since they posted nine wins and
ﬁve losses in the 1986-1987 sea-
son.

The team will try to continue
its wave of recent success at the
Centennial Conference champi-

“Everyone is asking, ‘Who are these guys?’

We ’ve placed dead last for six years in a row,

but now everyone is looking at as wondering

what we can do. We havea lot of conﬁdence. ’

onships next Saturday at Gettys-
burg College.

Despite their loss, Ursinus is
considered the favorite to add a
ﬁﬁh consecutive title to their im-
pressive trophy case.

But also, the Generals cannot
be counted out. After their two
big wins over Ursinus and Mul-
henberg, they have momentum in
their favor as they enter into the
Centennial Conference champi-
onships.

Boniello said, “Everyone is
asking, ‘Who are these giys?’
We’ve placed dead last for six
years in a row, but now everyone
is looking at us wondering what
we can do. We have a lot of con-

fidence. It just feels great beating
the topitwo dogs.”

As for the team as a whole,
there are very high expectations
for everyone.

Boniello said, “Across the
board we have a lot of kids who
can perform very well. We’re
hoping for at least four kids to get
in the ﬁnals.”

Boniello said, “The intensity

Generals win 8 events, sets 3 school records
and have 2 qualify for NCAA championships

By Mlke Huntress
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s indoor
track team returned from the
Bucknell Winter Classic this Sat-
urday with a host of accolades.

Against competition from all
levels, W&L’s Division III team
managed to claim two national
qualiﬁers, set six school records,
and ﬁelded eight winners between
the men’s and women’s teams.

It’s an impressive feat for a
program draws from a student
body which is a fraction of some
of the programs W&L competed
against Saturday.

The event which typiﬁed
W&L’s success was the women’s
mile. In that one event, the former
school record of 5:26.23 was bro-
ken by three different women.

Elizabeth Webb would have
had the new mark at 5:25.71
(she ﬁnished eighth overall in the
event) had she not been eclipsed
by two team mates.

Sophomore Becca Taylor ﬁn-
ished fourth overall (third among
Div III athletes) with a time of
5:19.52 and sophomore Jackie
Bums ﬁnished third overall (ﬁrst
among Div. III athletes) with a
time that now stands as W&L’s
benchmark mile time at 5:18.97.

Sophomore Stacy Doombos
took home two school records
herself on Saturday. The ﬁrst was
in the 200-meter dash with a time
of 26.88 seconds, which put her
ﬁrst among D-III athletes.

She later outdid her own
school record in the long jump
with a leap of l7’9.75”, which
stands as an NCAA Provisional
Qualifying Standard.

Freshman Maggie Sutherland
was W&L’s other signiﬁcant fe-
male jumper on Saturday, ﬁnish-
ing ﬁrst overall in the high jump,

“It was a group effort. There were so many

people in our heat that we wanted to stick to-

gether as much as possible. ”

JACKIE BURNS. sophomore distance runner

with ajump of5’5.0”.

It beat what was previously
her own school record, and also
was an NCAA Provisional Quali-
fying Standard.

Sutherland also broke her own
school record in the 55-meter
hurdles with a time of 8.95 sec-
onds, good for third among D—III
runners.

The W&L men’s performance
was highlighted by the efforts of
sophomores Drew Martin and
Michael Welsh.

Martin’s pole vault of 13’9.25”
placed him ﬁrst among D—III ath-
letes and Welsh’s time of 9:04.32
in the 3000-meters also put him at
the top of the D-III time sheet.

Other W&L runners did well
on Saturday. Sophomore Alan
Jackson was second among D-
III runners in the 5,000-meters,
junior Steve Rivoir placed third
among D—III runners with a mile
time of 4:34.84.

The 4x400-meter relay team
ﬁnished second among D—III
teams. Sophomore Chip McCoy,
junior Matt Harrison, freshman
Rob Saliers, and junior Marshall
French crossed the ﬁnish time in
a time of3:34.l6.

Throwers Billy Billington and
Ben Wilson also had solid perfor-
mances.

Billington, a freshman, put
up a weight throw distance of
4l’4.25” (good for third among
Div III throwers).

Sophomore Ben Wilson put up

a distance of 4l’4.25”, good for
second among D—III shot putters.

W&L’s men and women track
teams proved their mettle at Buck-
nell against stiff competition, per-
forming admirably.

Burns, who was competing in
her face race of the season, was
modest about setting her school
record: “I’m a little out of prac-
tice so I had to get used to it pretty
fast. It was a group effort. There
were so many people in our heat
that we wanted to stick together
as much as possible.”

Burns said that herself, Telf-
eyan, Taylor and Webb all took
turns leading the pack of W&L
women.

In the end, Burns led the way
to the ﬁnish with two of her team-

mates crossing the line immedi- V

ately after her.

Burns said she felt great aﬁer
taking a break from competition:
“I needed to take a mental break
from the cross country team, and
I wanted time to build up a big
mileage base. It was a mental and
a physical break.” .

It has been a very strong in-
door season for the Generals,
and the team has a great deal of
momentum going into the ODAC
championships.

“We’re a stronger team then
we were last year,” Burns said.

The Generals are back in ac-
tion this coming Saturday when
they take to the track at the Vir-
ginia Tech Challenge.

Swimmers prep for ODACs'

Women is swim team looks to carry on thirteen-year winning streak heading into the ODAC championships

By Mlchael Keenan"
STA FF w n are a

On Feb. 3 the women’s swim
team concluded its regular season
with ODAC victories over Hollins
and Randolph-Macon Woman’s
College to improve their over-
all record to 7-9 and 5-1 against
ODAC opponents.

The women defeated Hollins
180-61 and Randolph-Macon
Woman’s 154-86.

They have now won three of
their last four meets, with the only
loss coming to tenth ranked Johns
Hopkins.

The Generals were led by
sophomore Susan Mahoney, who
registered wins in the 200 back-
stroke and 1000 freestyle.

Junior Allison Rogers and se-
nior Abbie Sauter also contribut-
ed ﬁrst place ﬁnishes. Rogers won
the 50 free and Sauter touched
ﬁrst in the 100 free.

This season has been different
for the women, because for the
ﬁrst time in ﬁfteen years, a new
coach took over the program.

Over the summer, Kiki Ja-
cobs ended her ﬁfteen-year run
as Women’s Head Swim Coach

“Our record this year does not show how much

Joel has done for this team, but he has been

7

tremendous. ’

ABBIE SAUTER. senlor captaln

at Washington and Lee when she
accepted the Associate Athletic
Director position at Oberlin Col-
lege.

During her tenure the team
compiled a 121-79 record and has
a current streak of thirteen con-
secutive ODAC Championships.
Jacobs was named ODAC/Atlan-
tic States Coach of the Year ten
times.

Men’s Head Coach Joel Shi-
noﬁeld was named interim head
coach while a search began for a
new women’s coach.

The women’s team has re-
sponded extremely well to the
coaching change. Susan Mahoney
called Shinoﬁeld “one of the best
coaches” she’s ever had.

“We handled the coaching
change this year very well. Since
Joel was the coach for the boys’

team last year, we had some idea
of how practices would be run and
the work that would be performed
outside of the pool,” sophomore-
Julianne Miata said.

“Although Kiki was amazing
and we were sad to see her go,
Joel has really given us some-
thing to be excited for.”

“Our record this year does not
show how much Joel has done
for this team, but he has been tre-
mendous,” said Sauter. “Not only
is everyone on the team ﬁnally
swimming to their potential, but
Joel gives every one of his swim-
mers the conﬁdence to dive in and
leave everything we have in the
pool with every single race.”

Shinoﬁeld has brought new di-
mensions to the women’s training
program, including dry land train-
ing, lifting and running.

“Joel has brought a more in-
tense training program to the
team,” Miata said. “Not only do
we have more pool time, but we
do dry land two times a week all
together as a team, and then we
have running or weightlifting two
times a week that we do in our
spare time.”

Shinoﬁeld’s impact has ex-
tended beyond swimming tech-
nique and training regiments.

“To me, the ideal coach is
someone who knows his swim-
mers on a personal level and can
tell what each and every one of
his swimmers needs, and Joel
does an excellent job of that,”
said Sauter.

New Assistant Coach Kelli
Austin, a recent W&L graduate,
has also helped the women im-
prove this season.

“Our assistant Kelli is great
too, because she graduated only a
short time ago, so she knows ex-
actly what we’re going through,
even academically,” said Miata.

The women return to action
this Friday as they attempt to
win their fourteenth consecutive
ODAC Championship at Radford
College.

THE RING-TUM PHI ° 11

By Russ Weems
STAFF WRITER

A tough slide continued for the
men’s basketball team last week
as their losing streak stretched to
six games.

But the Generals ﬁnally got

; back into the win column last
4 night with an important win over
_Lynchburg.

The win moved W&L’s record
back to 11-11. The team has not
won that many games since the
1990-1991 squad went 12-14.

Senior captain Chris Halkitis

_ led W&L Sunday with 17 points
i on 5-for-8 shooting. Halkitis led
I the team in scoring his freshman

year but this year has spent less
time shooting and more time feed-
ing the ball to W&L’s talented big
men, juniors Greg Bienemann
and Femi Kusimo.

Though Bienemann struggled
during the losing streak" against
frequent double teams, he man-
aged to notch twelve points dur-
ing Sunday night’s win. Kusimo

chipped in nine.

Sophomore forward Kirk
Jones grabbed nine rebounds and
helped the Generals dominate the
glass by a 39-28 margin.

Earlier in the week W&L
played Virginia Wesleyan, Emory

. and Henry, and Hampden-Sydney,
all teams with winning records

and high standings in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference.
W&L lost three close games to

Greg Bienemann, Junior

12 points and and 5 rebounds.

18 points and 12 rebounds

some of the most talented teams
in the conference.

W&L went up against their
best opponent to date, the Virgin-
ia Wesleyan Marlins, last Sunday.
The reigning NCAA Division III
national champions have a 19-3
overall record with only one loss
in the ODAC. Midway through
the ﬁrst half, Virginia Wesleyan
only led by one point as the Gen-
erals proved they could play with
one of the premier teams in the
country.

The Marlins went on a run to
claim an 11 point lead, but the de-
termined Generals regrouped and
cut the lead to ﬁve points. W&L
closed the half down ten and
could not get closer than nine in
the second half. Brandon Adair,
the Marlin’s star player, proved to
be a tough task for the Generals as
he scored 29 points.

W&L was led by freshman
Zac White, who scored a career-
high 17 points on 6 for 9 shoot-
ing. The Generals kept ﬁghting,
and the game remained close, but
Wesleyan ended up with a 61-49
victory.

The Generals faced the Emory
and Henry Wasps Wednesday,
losing another‘ close one 100-95.
W&L shot a school-record 73%
from the ﬂoor but committed 29
costly turnovers. The Wasps also
stung the Generals at the line, go-
ing 26-36 from the stripe.

The game was relatively even
until 6:31 in the ﬁrst half, when

   
  
  

  
   

Emory and Henry went on an 18-
5 run to close the half. The Wasps
stretched theirlead to 20 in the
second half.

W&L mounted a gutsy come-
back, closing the gap to as close
as two, but Emory and Henry hit
some crucial free-throws down
the stretch to seal the game. Six
Generals scored in double ﬁgures
for the ﬁrst time in a decade, led
by Bienemann’s 18 point perfor-
mance.

Saturday W&L took on the Ti-
gers of Hampden Sydney. Kusi-
mo and Bienemann combined for
30 points in the General’s 71-60
defeat. W&L had a 5 point lead
near the end of the half, but an-
other late ﬁrst half run hurt the
Generals.

Hampden-Sydney scored 15
of the last 16 points in the half to
take a nine point advantage to the
locker room. The Generals got as
close as seven in the second half,
but when the ﬁnal whistle sound-
ed the Tigers had a victory by 11.

W&L’s offense was work-
ing smoothly early in the game,
but midway through the ﬁrst half
coach Bubba Smith of H-SC had
his team switch to a stiﬂing 2-
3 zone. The zone was effective

when the teams met in Farrnville H

earlier this season, and once again

the Generals struggled to break .1

through.

With W&L’s guards unable to
ﬁnd the big men down in the post,
the team was forced to rain three
pointers over the zone. Unfortu-
nately, W&L shot only 24 percent
from behind the arc.

Though the Generals have been
struggling down the stretch, they
still have a chance to make some
noise in the ODAC tournament.
The team will travel to Guilford

on Wednesday before concluding .

the regular season with a home
game against Bridgewater next
Saturday.

The ODAC tournament begins
on Thursday, Feb. 22 and ends the
following Sunday.

win our game against St. Maxy’s,
a team we haven’t beaten while
I’ve been at W&L.”

Baseball

he Generals, who had an
I 18-15-1 overall record
last season, return with
a strong lineup including junior
outﬁelder James Madden, who
hit .435 with a team-best seven
homeruns in his ﬁrst season as
a starter. Madden has been side-
lined with a wrist injury but will
be expected to make a big contri-
bution when he is able to return
to action.

In the ODAC preseason poll,
the Generals were ranked third
out of 10 teams.

Junior Tim Livingston said,
“We deserve to have high expec-

tations, and we’re eager to fulﬁll
those expectations.”

Seniors Richard Garland, Jor-
dan Wesley, Clayton Edwards,
and Dave Miller along with soph-
omores Terrence McKelvey and
Andrew Henderson are also ex-
pected to be big contributors for
the Generals this season.

Livingston added, “The most
exciting aspect of this season is
that almost everyone will have a
chance to contribute. We’re re-
turning our entire pitching staff,
and we have a lot to prove after a
mediocre 2006.”

The Generals will open their
2007 campaign with a trip to
Pheonix, Ariz. to compete in the
Desert Classic on February 22-
24.

then win it.”

ﬁ'om the starting lineup, the Wash-

team expect to have another great
season in 2007.

The team will feature six se-
niors, the most in the history of
women’s tennis here at W&L.
NCAA D-III singles champion
Emily Applegate is expected to
play ﬁrst singles for the Gener-
als, and senior captains Kristen
McClung and Ginny Wortham are
expected to play a key role for the
Generals throughout the season.
Sophomores Katie Tabb and Tori
Christmas, juniors Kelly Will, Re-
becca Timmis and Leah Weston,
and freshmen Katie Bouret and
Lauren Caire are expected to ﬁght
for the top singles positions.

The team has started indoor

practices and challenge matches
at the Duchossois Tennis Center.
Applegate said, “At this point, we
are just really trying to be focused
and work hard in practice. I think
when matches start we need to
just take it one match at a time
and not look ahead too much.”

Head coach Cinda Rankin has
a simple goal for the Generals in
the 2007 season, “To be the best
team we can be.

The Generals open their season
at home on February 28 against
Hollins. Another squad will be
on the road that day to take on
Lynchburg.

The season will give the Gen-
erals a chance to compete against
nationally ranked opponents,
included long-time rival Emory

University. Emory was the team
that ﬁnally defeated W&L during
the ﬁnals of the D-III chamption-
ship.

As the season begins, the
Generals will be seeking another
chance at the NCAA D-III title.

“We are always right up there
at the top, and I think this year we
have as good a chance as ever to
win the whole thing,” Applegate
said.

Men's Tennis

T he spring season for the
Washington and Lee
men’s tennis team will
begin on Tuesday afternoon when
the Generals take on Lynchburg
College at the Duchossois Tennis
Center. The Generals are a young
team with only one returning se-
nior. The big story for the Gener-
als is junior Tim Ross, who spent
his summer working out and play-
ing lots of tennis and now ﬁnds
himself in the number one singles
spot for the Generals.

Head coach David Detwiler
said, “The pre-season buzz is that
we are a young team with one se-
nior, Jon Malooly, in the top six of

Women’s tennis hopes to Win it all

the singles line-up.”

The Generals played in several
tournaments this fall as well.

A scoring change in NCAA
rules will also change the Gener-
als game plan for the season, as
doubles matches how each count
for one point a piece, as opposed
to the old system where winning
2 of 3 matches resulted in one
point overall.

“Doubles becomes very im-
portant this year and so we need
to improve our doubles skills
in order to insure victory,” said
Bunn.

One of the keys to success for
the Generals this year will be to
keep maintain a healthy, injury-
free team.

Detwiler said, “We already
have had some injuries that are
holding some top players back.
This is making it tough to estab-
lish a true line-up both in singles
and doubles.” .

And as the season begins, De-
twiler is optimistic about the pos-
sibilities.

“We are excited about defend-
ing our ODAC Championship
and returning to the NCAA tour-
nament.”

Before this weekend, Wash-
ington and Lee wrestling was in
the middle of a successful sea-
son, having defeated Ursinus and
Muhlenberg on Feb. 3.

Those teams were considered

the top two in the
W&L 21 Centennial Confer-
NNAS 15 ence, but both fell to
the Generals.

Knowing they couldn’t top the
satisfaction of those two victories
was no impediment to their effort
this weekend, however, as the
Generals continued their winning
ways by defeating Newport News
Apprentice School 21-15.

Saturday moming’s home

match featured ﬁve victories for
the hosts out of ten matches, two
of them by forfeit.

Freshman sensation Sammy
Brusca led the way in the 125-
pound weight class with a 8-6
victory over Kevin Hill.

The win gave Brusca a 14-8
overall record, third-best on his
team.

The Generals also received
wins from David Shubick and
Jesse Sataloff on Saturday.

The team’s strong showing
Saturday was unsurprising, as the
Generals have been improving all
winter long towards this point.

The team had stumbled early
in the season but has lost only

was a one-point decision to Johns

the Warner Center played host
to the Generals, the'Mules of

Allentown, PA, and the Ursinus

It was widely expected that
the Bears would have the advan-

etuming its entire starting
Rdefense and an offense that

will feature two preseason
All-Americans, the Washing-
ton and Lee men’s lacrosse team
looks have a strong 2007 cam-
paign. Sophomores Tim Skeen
and Harry St. John were named as
preseason All-Americans and are
expected to play a large role for
the Generals’ offense.

After graduating two seniors
and one starter from last year,
the Generals have a great deal of
experience going into the season.
Ranked fourth in the ODAC pre-
season poll, the Generals have big
goals to surpass preseason expec-
tations.

Senior captain Chris Lalli said,
“Our goals this year are to win the
ODAC and make it to the nation-
al tournament, with the goal of a
National Championship always
being a motivator.”

On the sidelines, head coach
Gene McCabe will be in his ﬁrst
seasonfor the Generals.

Lalli said, “The addition of
Coach McCabe to our team this
year has all of us excited to be
back out on the field.”

The off-season was a beneﬁ-
cial period for the Generals.

McCabe said, “Our guys
understand the importance of
staying healthy and developing
skills, strength and conditioning
throughout the year. They did a
great job as a unit taking owner-
ship and working hard in the off
season.”

As the season begins, the Gen-

erals willihave high expectations
for themselves, as they strive to
return to the NCAA tournament.

McCabe added, “Our expecta-
tions on a daily basis focus on our-
selves. We work hard to improve
and play to the best of our ability
each day. Success will come to
us if we do that and support each
other throughout the process.”

McCabe is quite familiar with
W&L athletics, having served as
an assistant lacrosse and foot-
ball coach for the Generals from
1998-2001.

McCabe said, “W&L is a spe-
cial place. The people, the tradi-
tions, and the history make it spe-
cial. I do not think there is a better
place in the country to coach la-
crosse.”

Women's Lacrosse

aving been selected to
win a fourth-straight

said, “Starting a new season is al-
ways a lot of fun and a challenge.
We have to work with one another
and learn the strengths and weak-
nesses of the new and old play-
ers.”

Opening the season on the road
will be a chance for the Generals
to come together as a team while
playing a new opponent.

Lovejoy added, “Chemistry
is always a huge part of our team
and we are all very excited for our
trip to Dallas and the time we’ll
be spending together.”

Head coach Jan Hathom said,
‘‘It will be exciting to begin play-
ing games and it is my hope thab
we will play hard and play togeth-
er to accomplish all the goals and
expectations we have set before
us.”

The Generals will be facing
some opponents from Maine as
they take on Colby and Bates. The
Colby game will feature an inter-
esting opponent for Lovejoy, who
will face her younger sister on the
ﬁeld. Bates’ lacrosse coach, Brett
Allen, was also an assistant coach
for the Generals in their 2005 sea-

ence. Students from both the
undergraduate and law schools
along with members of the
faculty participated in book
discussions. presented paper

professor and chair of the con-
ference, Robin LeBlanc. Dr.
LcBlanc said she was trying to
think of ways to build bridges
between Williams School stu-
dents and other W&L students
when the idea for a research
conference occurred to her.

Her proposal was accepted
by faculty members on a Wil-

after a committee of faculty.
students, and volunteers was
formed to plan the event. The
ﬁrst SSA Conference was held
in November 2004.

This year the conference
was again run by a committee.
and over 200 students and fac-
ulty members participated.

“The W&L community has
responded with tremendous
enthusiasm," says Dr. LeBlanc.
“I am amazed by the kinds of
works students have proposed
to present.”

The material presented dur-
ing the day was indeed diverse.
covering everything from real-
ity television to nuclear weap-
ons policy. Students shared
work from study abroad expe-

riences, senior theses and inde-
pendent study projects.

Groups of students and
professors gathered to discuss
reading on topics such as gen-
der. se.\'uality, and religion.
The Art Showing provided an
e.\'hibition of paintings and art-
work.

Scientiﬁc research was pre-
sented on topics from student
alcohol use to “The Kinetics of
the llydrolysis of Bisacodyl.”
Students also presented origi-
nal creative work including
ﬁlm and play readings.

In the evening a dance re-
cital was held in Keller The-

°Schoo| explains hazing hotline

Anonymous website has been used this year, but administration still uses other resources

By Hllary Craig
STAFF WRITER

During the dreary months of
January through March, fatigued
freshmen males at Washington
and Lee University are seen fall-
ing asleep in class, wearing coat
and ties daily, and making peanut
butter and jelly sandwiches on
an ironing board in front of Ley-
burn.

Welcome to pledgeship.

During the eight weeks of
“new member education.” begin-
ning with tear night and culminat-
ing with the alleged “hell week“,
freshmen males are supposed to
be learning about brotherhood.
albeit through largely secret and
controversial methods (i.e. haz-

.I

ing). Hazing is deﬁned as a ha-
rassing. excessive task associated
with initiation or membership in
an organization. It involves mis-
treatment of prospective mem-
bers by those who exercise con-
trol over them.

Both students and administra-
tion are attempting to make Greek
life at W&l., a more positive expe-
rience. primarily by putting a stop
to hazing.

“This is an honorable place,
people are supposed to exhibit
honorable behavior." said Direc-
tor of Public Safety Mike Young.
“Hazing is not honorable and it‘s
dangerous."

Nearly four years ago, after a
series of hazing incidents, a corn-
mittee eonvened to determine

“This is an honorable place, people are sup-

posed to exhibit honorable behavior Hazing is

not honorable and its dangerous. ”

MIKE YOUNG, Director of Public Safety
 

what should be done to stop haz-
ing. The committee recommend-
ed having a W&L hazing hotline
as an opportunity for sources to
report hazing incidents while re-
maining completely anonymous.
Studcnts can access the hazing
website at http://hazing.wlu.edu
and send any concerns directly
to Dawn Watkins. Dean of Stu-
dents.

According to Greek Life Di-
rector Jason Rodocker, the admin-
istration has no way of ﬁnding out
who sent the email.

“The university does not do
anything to violate the anonymity
of the email,” said Rodocker.

While all emails are taken se-
riously, it is often hard or even
impossible to follow up on vague
emails. Both Rodocker and Young

adamantly encouraged speciﬁc
information and as much identi-
ﬁcation as a person is willing to
offer.

“Clearly, a message with detail
and someone to follow up with al-
lows us to be much more effec-
tive,” said Rodocker.

While the hotline is “a le-
gitimate opportunity to report
things,” said Young, it is just
one way that the administration
receives reports of hazing. The
administrators receive informa-
tion from a wide range of sources,
including people who work with
W&L, parents, active fraternity
and sorority members, new mem-
bers, RAs and DCs, peer counsel-
ors, and independent students.

While some are concerned

that the majority of tips the hot-
line receives are unfounded, the
administration is conscious of the
possibility that the anonymous
emails are either not accurate or
exaggerated. A single anonymous
email does not warrant a full in-
vestigation.

“Any house that was investi-
gated this year, we received mul-
tiple reports from multiple sourc-
es on multiple occasions, which
when cross-referenced revealed
information to warrant an inves-
tigation,” said Rodocker. “There
are deﬁnitely no witch-hunts go-
ing on.”

reports about the behavior of a

Chi Omega is chili cook-oﬂon C
Saturday raised money for the
Make a Wish Foundation.

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

fter 20 hours of cooking,

the Chemistry Depart-

ment’s “Hazmat Chili”
was bound to taste good. Profes-
sors Steven Desjardins, Marcia
France and Fred LaRiviere stood
behind signs urging everyone to
try out Chilium, the newly dis-
covered element 138.

These professors took ﬁrst
place and joined 16 other teams on
Saturday at Chi Omega’s Make a
Wish chili cook-off. Teams came
from academic departments, fra-
ternities and other campus orga-
nizations. Each group paid a $75
entry fee to compete.

Chi O juniors Mallory Frewer
and Briana‘ Gregory have been
planning the event since last Oc-
tober. Frewer said she came up
with the idea to help her house
meet its goal of fulﬁlling one
wish each year through the Make
a Wish Foundation.

:‘,;We  to recruit teams
thiggtigh iinyitations» to fratemities,
aca'Hemic"“'dep‘artrr‘rents and all of
the campus organizations,” Frew-
er said. “We’re trying to start a
tradition of doing a wish each
year, and those usually take about
$5,000-$7,000.”

The organizers also sent out
invitations and entry forms to lo-
cal schools, churches, businesses
and community service groups.
Frewer said the invitations ex-
plained the event and why Chi
O was organizing it, but no local
groups decided to get involved
and enter the contest.

Frewer said she is still adding
up ﬁnal totals but thinks the event
raised about $3,500. Money was
raised through the entry fees, at
ﬁve dollar fee to sample and vote
on the chili and a raffle of items
donated by local businesses.

Each team worked to bring its
distinctive style to the table. Chi
O’s Red Hot team battled with
Sigma Nu’s squad to see who had
the spiciest dish.

Bill Larson, a Sigma Nu se-
nior, said his fraternity brothers
used his family recipe.

“We found out about the event

from some of the Chi 0 sisters,”
Larson said, “so a bunch of us got
together and cooked this up yes-
terday afternoon.”

Kelly Hemminger, the Biology
Department’s molecular techni-
cian, said her team -- which won
second place -- was calling itself
the Capsaicin Crew. Capsaicin is
a molecule in peppers that can im-

prove your health.
“We’re promoting the health
_beneﬁts,” Hemminger said.’

“Capsaicin can lower bad choles-
terol, raise your endorphins and
up your metabolism.”

To make sure nobody forgot
about the molecule’s health ben-
eﬁts, Hemminger and her team
put up a poster and a model of the
molecule. She said, however, that
her team decided not to add too
many spicy peppers.

“We decided to focus on taste
over health,” she said.

Her team succeeded on the
taste front, ﬁxing up a nice dish
made with chicken and chorizo
sausage.

Desjardins said the chemis-

try team made its recipe with six ’

pounds of ground chuck roast.
After cutting it up, they stuck it in
a crock pot and let it simmer for
20 hours. To make sure everyone
could ﬁnd their station, the chem-
ists put up an enormous trident
brand on the table.

While the chemistry professors
stuck with lab coats and goggles,
Greatful Chili broke out tie-dye
t-shirts for the event and the jour-
nalism department wore hats that
print setters at the Roanoke Times
used to wear. Department chair
Brian Richardson and department
secretary Melissa Cox called their
entree “Joumalist’s chili — What
a crock.” Their recipe worked in
unusual ingredients like choco-
late, pecans and beer, giving it a
unique ﬂavor.

Frewer said the sorority will
receive information about pos-
sible wish candidates once the
event’s total revenues are added
up.

“We’re hoping we can pair
with someone nearby so we can
stay involved with that person and
help with their wish,” she said.

chapter, the Inter-fraternity
Council (IFC) or Rodocker con-
ducts a “preliminary inquiry,” the
ﬁrst step toward an investigation.
During the inquiry the IF C ques-
tions the chapter, or the chapter
meets with Rodocker.

“The results could be that
things get cleared up, or that
they do not get cleared up,” said
Rodocker.

If the IFC and administration
still have concerns, Young con-
ducts a formal investigation and
issues a report to the IFC. It is the
lFC’s job to have a hearing and
consider the report and any other
information it has from talking
to chapter members and officers.
The members look at the totality

of circumstances and make a de-
cision based on what they think is
best for the Greek system and the
chapter. Rodocker applauded the
IFC’s attempt to improve Greek
life without losing traditions that
are worth keeping.

“The IF C ofﬁcers give an
enormous amount of time to a
volunteer position in an effort to
do what is best for the Greek sys-
tem by preserving and improving
it,” he said.

However, with respect to haz-
ing issues, the IFC’s decision is
not the ﬁnal outcome. It is simply
a recommendation that goes to
the Student Affairs Committee,
which consists of half faculty and
half students and is chaired by
Dean Watkins. This committee’s
decision is the ﬁnal outcome.

Currently, both the Phi Gam-
ma Delta (FIJI) and Kappa Sig-
ma chapters at W&L are being
investigated for “behavior they
shouldn’t have exhibited and
wasn’t part of their new member
education,” said Young.

FIJI’s President Andrew
Rothey and Kappa Sigma’s in-
coming President George Hunter
will not comment until the ﬁnal
adjudication by the Student Af-
fairs Committee, which is expect-
ed to come within the next three
weeks.

“The conﬁdentiality of it is in-
tended to protect the chapter be-
fore the full facts are determined
and before any decision is made,”
said Rodocker. “We don’t want to
encourage the rumor mill or taint
the process.”

According to Young, the haz-
ing hotline has been a complete
success.

“Before we had this, we didn’t
have the opportunity for students
to give us this information,” said
Young. “It allows an area for
people to report sensitive infor-
mation, but it’s a shame that you
have to be anonymous to report
things.”

Rodocker agreed that the hot-
line has had a positive effect on
the Greek system, but empha-
sized that it is only a small part of
the investigation process.

“Focusing on the hotline
would not be an accurate assess-
ment by itself,” said Rodocker.
“The majority of anything that’s
come out this year has not come
directly from the hotline.”

 Hazing inquiries continue

While big improvements have
been made to the Greek system
over the past few years, the ad-
ministration still hopes for more
changes.

“I would love to see chapters
have conversations about ways
to build brotherhood that would
be transparent,” said Rodocker.
“You could do worthwhile activi-
ties on Canaan Green and not be
embarrassed.”

Young agrees that pledgeship
should be focused on building
healthy relationships, which does
not include causing harm to fel-
low “brothers.”

“I wish our students were
more humane and caring about
their fellow students and would
not allow themselves to do harm-
ful things to others,” he said.

let, Jazz, Tap, Hip Hop, and Con-

mances.

The day culminated in a lun-
cheon and address by keynote
speaker Mario Livio. Dr. Livio
is a Senior Astrophysicist at the
Hubble Space Telescope Science
Institute.

He gave an engaging talk
titled: “Symmetry: From Human
Perception and Mate Selection to
the Laws of Nature.” Dr. Livio’s

.address covered key concepts
from his new book, “The Equa-
tion That C.ouldn’t Be Solved:
How Mathematical Genius Dis-
covered the Language of Sym-
metry.” Following his talk, Dr.
Livio held a book signing in the
Elrod Commons.

The diversity of talent and
research exhibited by partici-
pants during the conference is a
testament to the vivacity of in-
tellectual life at W&L, says Dr.
LeBlanc, a life that too often gets
overlooked by students in wake

of the school’s thriving social at-
mosphere.

That’s really the point of SSA,
continues Dr. LeBlanc, “to remind
ourselves that it’s really cool to be
a learner and a teacher and to be
involved in college life.”

Dr. LeBlanc says the most
satisfying part of the day are the
huge smiles on students’ faces as
they celebrate “The Life of The
Mind.”

These smiles were indeed
evident throughout the day as
students, faculty members, and
members of the community com-
memorated intellectual achieve-
ment.

At the luncheon Dr. LeBlanc
also announced exciting news:
the conference has just received
$50,000, enough money to secure
at least two more SSA events in
future years.

The applause and overwhelm-
ing support exhibited by the W&L
community at the news suggest
that the day will indeed become a
traditioneone that will continue
to acknowledge W&L’s intellec-
tual life well into the future.

Pause your iPod and try something new. Learn musical
trivia and expose yourself to a few unheard of artists

By Dylan Merrill
COLUMNIST

First of all, I’d like to say that
this article is a gift to you, noble
reader.

Let me explain with a few
pieces of rock and roll trivia:

° Stevie Wonder’s real name is
Steveland Hardaway Judkins

0 When Elvis Presley was draft-
ed into the Army in 1958, his
monthly salary dropped ﬁom
$100,000 to $78.

0 Although the root of the maga-
zine Rolling Stone's name is
widely debated, many have cit-
ed the songs of blues musician
Howlin' Wolf and folk god Bob
Dylan as the original source of
the magazine’s moniker.

- Having previously sent a few
demo records in search of a
contract, the Beatles received a
dismissing letter from the Decca
‘Recording Company that said,
"We don't like their sound and
guitar music is on the way out."

~ Folk singer Paul Simon got
the title of his song "Mother and
Child Reunion" from the name

of a chicken-and-egg dish at a
Chinese restaurant.

- The rights to the South Caro-
lina state anthem are owned by
Michael Jackson.

- When Prince decided to be-
come a Jehovah's Witness in
2001, at least 50 songs were too
explicit to be performed.

- The most valuable guitar in the
world “Blackie,” is a Fender
Stratocaster once owned by Eric
Clapton and it is worth almost a
million dollars

- Jimmy Page, founding mem- '

ber of Led Zeppelin, played as
a session guitarist on the Tom
Jones hit, "It’s Not Unusual."

- According to guitarist Robbie
Robertson, Bob Dylan's back-
ing band vowed to resist con-
formity, which included giving
their band a name. Their record
company later pressured them
into naming themselves, but the
execs had to settle for simply
“The Band.”

See? Music is interesting.

The new reality t.v. series
"I'm from Rolling Stone" has
recently brought criticism to the
program's featured magazine,
which is known for its roasting
of generic and ridiculous reality
shows.

Regardless of its criticism,
Rolling Stone’s reality show is
laudable, because it shows that
they are both observers and par-
ticipants in popular culture.

Why don’t we try this? I
mean why can’t we just stop
Facebooking and listen to some
music or read a book? There’s a
lot of culture out there...

So do me a favor: pause your

or some David Vandervelde.

Hazing hotline is a good resource, but school
should not expect a totally public pledgeship

Campus has been buzzing
this winter with news — or ru-
mors — about the anonymous
hazing hotline.

Everyone has a new story
about which fraternity has
just been turned in, who’s
under investigation or who’s
back in the clear. Nobody can
agree on how exactly the hot-
line works.

The on-line hazing hot-
line is undoubtedly a good
resource for freshmen as they
go through pledgeship, and
it’s reassuring to see that the
administration — in theory
— is relying on more than just
anonymous tips when it in-
vestigates the activities being
held by different fraternities.

The IFC has established
a solid track record of rec-
ognizing what should and
should not be permitted dur-
ing pledgeship. Though they
oﬁen rely on Mike Young
and the Public Safety Depart-
ment for assistance with their
investigations, the decisions
about punishments should
stay inside the IFC.

If W&L trusts students to
govern and administer the
Honor System, that same trust

should be extended to the fra-
ternity system. Is the Student
Affairs Committee — a group
comprised of administrators,
faculty and student leaders
— really more qualiﬁed than
the IFC to judge fraternities?

But the administration
must keep working hard to
avoid basing investigations
off of hearsay and rumor.
DCs, parents and indepen-
dents can all provide valuable
tips about hazing, but none
of those groups are actually
present when hazing occurs.
Anyone who spends more
than 48 hours on this campus
knows how stories mutate and
grow “almost instantaneously.
The only 100 percent reliable
sources are the pledges and
upperclassmen present when
pledgeship activities occur.

Aﬁer hazing problems
both at W&L and nationwide,
a focus on stopping hazing is
appropriate. Nobody in the
student body or administra-
tion wants to see another frat
house leﬁ empty after a haz-
ing scandal. Between Beta
and Sig Ep, W&L has seen
enough frats thrown out dur-
ing the last four years.

While the focus on haz-
ing is relevant and appropri-
ate, the administration has
unreasonable expectations
for its fraternities. Yes, as
Jason Rodocker suggested,
perhaps more pledgeship ac-
tivities could be held in pub-
lic (Phi Psi already does this,
but maybe that’s not what he
meant).

But fraternities should
not be required — or even
expected — to conduct all of
their business in the public
eye. There’s a reason each
house keeps the chapter room
locked.

There is a middle ground
here. Fraternities should be
able to shape their pledge
classes without falling back
on pointless physical punish-
ments and without the admin-
istration peering over their
shoulder.

There’s an issue of trust at
stake here. The fraternities
need to believe that the ad-
ministration is not out to get
each house in trouble. At the
same time, the administra-
tion must give the fraternities
some leeway and privacy to
conduct pledgeship.

Working with a Houston charity turned nameless faces into real people

ine. That’s the average
age of a homeless person
in Houston, Texas.

If all the men, women, and
children people who are homeless
in Houston decided to sleep in the
beds provided by the numerous
shelters, thousands would have to
spend the night in the cold.

Half of the homeless popula-
tion deals with either a mental or
physical disability.

Not all homeless people are
drug addicts or uneducated, con-
trary to stereotypes.

Fiﬁeen students, myself in-
cluded, leamed all the above
while volunteering at a day shel-
ter in Houston for a week.

As part of the Nabors-spon-
sored alternative break, we
worked with SEARCH. The
Houston alumni chose SEARCH
for us to work with because it fo-
cuses on helping homeless people
reach self-sufficiency.

SEARCH has a job training
center that includes GED classes,
healthcare, a day care for home-
less children whose parents are
usually attending classes or work-
ing, a van for giving out food and
offering services, and a cater-
ing company where the culinary
graduates can work.

Each one of us said the week
was eye-opening.

We worked with all the pro-
grams, but the most memorable
was the Mobile Outreach, where

were homeless.

I admit that before this trip, I
would always avert my eyes when
I saw a homeless person outside
stores or by the freeway. I didn’t
want to see them and I deﬁnitely
didn’t want to help them.

I thought that they didn’t de-
serve my pity or my money and
if I did give money, I assumed.it
would promptly be spent on alco-
hol or drugs instead of on food or
clothing.

I even justiﬁed my behavior by
saying that no one wants pity and
that money would only continue
a vicious cycle, so I was saving
them a lot of trouble.

Excuses.

Yes, some of the people I met
had been addicted to drugs. Yes, I
saw people with disabilities. And
yes, no one I met wanted or need-
ed my pity.

In Houston, I met a man in his
ﬁfties who had a business degree
and ran his own restaurant before
he lost both of his legs in a hor-
rendous accident.

Suddenly unable to walk, he
lost his business, his family, and
his home.

He turned to drugs. He lived
under an interstate overpass. He
knew the people from SEARCH

for more than year before he
was ready to leave the streets.
SEARCH helped him enroll in a
detox program. ’‘

He works for SEARCH’s ca-
tering service and speaks to others
about his time when he was home-
less. He now also walks with the
help of artiﬁcial legs bought with
contributions from the program’s
donors.

While giving out sandwiches,
we met people who were on the
streets for different reasons.

People who knew what
SEARCH does would run down
the van signaling us to stop.

We also met people who
waved us on. That was a surprise
because I thought that everyone
would be happy and grateful for
the van’s services.

Our team leader, Don, who
himself used to be homeless, told
us that people may have enough
food already or would not want to
be bothered.

I was also impressed that
SEARCH did not push people to
come to the building for help. A
person has to be ready to come off
the streets.

For people who are ready,
SEARCH employees are al-
ways available. Our team leaders

knew the people by name that we
stopped for and would hand out
their card with cell phone num-
bers on it.

Everything revolved around
the client.

I had never thought about how
hard it would be to get a job when
you’re homeless.

The Urban Plunge gave W&L
students the actual experience oi
being homeless, and SEARCH
is the next logical step. They of-
fer food, laundry, showers, com-
puters, voicemail service, and so
much more.

The people we met were
homeless because of job losses,
mistakes, and other unexpected
and uncontrollable reasons.

These people were smart, had
the skills for a job and made an
effort. None of them had planned
on becoming homeless. They
didn’t deserve what had happened
to them, but they were working
past that.

I guess before the trip I had
never really thought of the home-
less people I saw on the streets as
really people. In my mind, they
lost their identity. But the people
we met surprised us all. They had
lives, families and degrees.

I still won’t give money to the
people I see in front of stores or
by the freeway but for different
reasons. Don told us that money
would not make a positive dif-
ference but helping out at a local
shelter would be a better choice.

As one of the other people on
the trip said, I may never go home
again. I just want to volunteer on
trips for the rest of my time here.

I.

Many Washington and Lee
students have never heard of
I11 Noise, the band that won the
$1,000 first prize at last Friday’s
Battle of the Bands, and for good
reason. Until two weeks ago the
band never existed, said band
member Derin Harrison.

Ill Noise, whose name came
from the word Illinois, was origi-
nally started by seniors Frank Lee,-
Sam Wilmoth and Harrison. Lee,
a native of Chicago, is credited
with coming up with the band’s
name despite the fact, he claimed,
that some members didn’t like it.
As friends they always thought
about forming a band, he said.

The band ended up with a total
of six members. Others include
students DeVarion Jarelle “DJ”
Carter, Jameson Graber and Chris
Rucker. ‘

Before their performance,
the band practiced for about 20
hours, experimenting with differ-
ent songs and sounds.

“It was just a bunch of us hav-
ing fun,” said Harrison. “Our big-
gest problem was focus.”

Yet the members were surpris-
ingly modest about their award,
saying that they never expected to
win. Rucker seemed overwhelmed
with enthusiasm, comparing the
night to the Grammys.

The event, organized by the
General Activities Board and Stu-
dent Activities, included a total of
eight bands, each of which per-
formed at the Doremus Gym.

111 Noise’s biggest challeng-
ers were Velva Bar Lights who
placed second, winning $500, and
Dr. Kenneth and the Googleplex,
who ﬁnished third, winning a
$250 prize.

Although many bands came
out with clean, precise music,
Harrison and Lee summed up their
strength in one word: energy.

“We moved the crowd more

“It was just a bunch of us having fun. Our big-

gest problem was focus. ’

J

DERIN HARRISON, class of 2007
 

than the other bands,” said Har-
rison.

Combining hip-hop and R&B
with the sounds of jazz and rock,
the band achieved a unique sound
that seemed to get the crowd
dancing and waving to the beat.
Rucker began the performance
by rapping to Jay-Z’s “Show Me
What You Got.”

Lee later wowed the audience
with his freestyling, and Harrison
stood out by jamming with his
saxophone, giving the songs a
different vibe. DJ Carter pounded
the drums, Graber played the gui-
tar and Wilmoth played the bass.
The band took audience participa-
tion one step further when Rucker
jumped off stage, handing plastic
red roses to cheering audience
members.

“I really wanted a rose so I
could feel special! So I reached
for one when he started handing
them out, so yeah I was pretty
much ecstatic to get one,” said
freshman Kim Holland.

According to the contest rules,
bands were judged on four criteria:
musicianship, originality,’ stage
presence and overall impressions.
The judges’ votes were worth 75
percent while the crowd’s reac-
tion was worth 25 percent.

Yet the night was off to a rough
start with the ﬂrst band Sheep
Herders. Despite its unusual
name and equally unusual sound,
the band didn’t seem to “herd” the
enthusiasm of many of the audi-
ence members. The instruments
drowned out the singers’ voices,
and this reporter could not hear
the lyrics clearly.

Agent Flynn, led by singer CJ
Boyd, got the event started with

their raw rock and roll vibe. The
band sang cover songs by The
Clash and The Rolling Stones. At
one point, electric guitarist Joel
Poelhuis revved up the crowd by

jumping from the stage and jam-

ming to the music.

Second place Velva Bar
Lights provided a strong con-
trast to Agent Flyrm’s rock and
roll sound, including songs such
as Bob Dylan’s “All Along the
Watchtower.”

Students close to the stage
momentarily waved their lighters
and cell phones to the pop music
of band Jon Bovi. However, lead
singer of the band Matt Amling
couldn’t hide his lack of memo-
rization from the audience or the
judges as he constantly looked
down at the lyrics placed on the
music stand in front of him.

Third place winner Dr. Ken-
neth and the Googleplex sang
Stevie Wonder’s “Superstition”
and Marvin Gaye’s “Sexual Heal-
ing,” creating a Motown feel to
the band.

Their performance included
beatboxing by lead singer Mal-
colm Hines and a drum solo by
Spencer McElroy. Other bands
included Conviction, who sang

their original song “Immortal

Man” and Bluegrass band Rikki
Tikki Tavi’s performance came
complete with a banjo and a har-
monica. ‘

Freshman Rasaq Lawal, who
commented on how loud the
music was, was seen wearing
“fashionable” orange earplugs
throughout the concert to soﬁen
the volume.

“[The music] was beating
against my chest,” he said.

lowed by Guilford, Hunting-
don, Whitworth, Transylvania,
Oglethorpe, Rhodes, W&L,
Wisconsin-Eau Claire and St.
John’s (Minn.). The Generals

The W&L Riding Team has had
great results so far in their winter
and spring seasons. Starting their
winter campaign with a strong
ﬁfth-place ﬁnish at Sweet Briar
College, the Generals went on
to claim the Reserve Title at
the Bridgewater College IHSA
show. The Generals defeated
perennial powerhouses UVA
and Hollins at the Bridgewater
show. Part of their success can be
contributed to their year-round
training, which has clearly made
a diﬁerence for the Generals. At
the Bridgewater College IHSA,
co-captains Kiltie Tompkins and
Lilly Haywood captured ﬁrst
place ribbons, while Alice Shih
and Brooks Vardell captured
second place in their respective
events for the Generals. Four
additional riders qualified to
ride at the IHSA Regionals held
last weekend at UVA. Brynne
Archer had already qualified
earlier in the season, and she was
joined by Sarah Bujtas, Kathryn
George, and co-captains Brittany
Bansak and Lilly Haywood.
Ashley Billman ﬁnished third in
Open Over Fences, at Bridgewa-
ter’s meet while Vardell ﬁnished
ﬁﬁh. In the Intermediate Fences,
Kiltie Tompkins ﬁnished in ﬁﬂh
place. Brittany Bansak ﬁnished
ﬁfth in the Novice Fences, while
Brynne Archer ﬁnished sixth. In
the Open Flat, Vardell captured
second place for the Generals,
while Billman ﬁnished in ﬁlth.
In Intermediate Flats, Kiltie
Tompkins and Lilly Haywood
tied for ﬁrst place, while Cath-
erine Hook took fourth place in
Novice Flat. Alice Shih ﬁnished
second in Walk-Trot-Canter,
while Hila Yashar ﬁnished fourth
in Walk-Trot. At Sweet Briar
College, Billman ﬁnished sec-
ond in the Open Flat. Bansak
ﬁnished third in the Novice Flat
while George ﬁnished fourth in

Track sets records

Teams break seven records as women ﬁnish second and men ﬁfth at ODAC meets

By Michael Fahey
sponrs canon

he Washington and Lee

I men’s and women’s track

teams ﬁnished their indoor

campaigns with impressive show-

ings at the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Championships.

The women ﬁnished second
out of ﬁve times, while the men
placed four out of six teams.

The W&L women set a new
school record for the most points
recorded in ODAC champion-
ships with 161 points, and they
lost to champion Roanoke Col-
lege by a mere 13 points.

The Generals had ﬁve confer-
ence champions, 13 all-confer-
ence citations, set two confer-
ence championship records and,
most impressively, toppled seven
school records throughout the
course of the meets.

The W&L women accumulat-
ed 161 points, three more points
than the highest-ever winning to-
tal in ODAC Championship his-
tory but 13 points fewer than the
total scored by Roanoke College.
The men tallied 42 points.

Leading the way for the wom-
en was sophomore Stacy Doom-
bos, who competed in an incredi-
ble seven events for the Generals.
The star was the champion in the
triple jump and ﬁnished second in
the long jump and the high jump.
Doombos also crossed the line
fourth in the 400 meters and sixth
in the 200 meters.

Freshman Maggie Sutherland
also was a key contributor for
the Generals, competing in ﬁve
events, capturing ﬁrst in the high
jump and third in the triple jump.
Sutherland set a new record in the
55 meter hurdles, besting her own
time from an earlier meet.

Junior Elizabeth Brandler
ﬁnished second in the pole vault
and ﬁfth in the triple jump (9.86
In), and sophomore Jackie Burns
placed second in the 5,000 me-
ters with a school-record time
and ﬁnished third in the mile. The
Distance Medley Relay squad
crossed the ﬁnish line ﬁrst, setting
a meet record.

Sophomore Becca Taylor won

the mile with a school-record and-

meet-record time of 5:17.42 and
also placed sixth in the 800 me-
ters and fourth in the 5,000 me-
ters. Freshman Elizabeth Kraus-
nick won the 800 meters with a

®ToYoTA I moving forward > ® 

meet-record and school-record

time of 2:23.88, while sophomore
Elizabeth Webb placed second in
the 800 meters, also setting a new
school record.

Going into the spring outdoor
season, the Generals have a lot to
look forward to and a great deal
to be proud of. “Everyone seemed
to put their heart into the meet be-
cause we knew we not only had a
chance at coming home with ﬁrst
place, but we were prepared to do
it,” Brandler said.

Doombos said that the wom-
en’s season was a great success.
“Overall the season was great. It
was a lot of fun having so many
new freshmen on the team that
really stepped up and had a great
indoor season,” she said.

Taylor said the support of her
teammates was crucial.

“It’s amazing how well this
team works together and supports
each other. For instance, one of
my events last weekend was the
5000 meters. And even though
this is usually a very long, dull
25 lap race, the whole team lined
the track cheering and yelling for
us.  I know it was the support of
the team that made all the differ-
ence,” she said.

On the men’s side, the Gener-
als were once again led by fresh-
man Billy Billington, who ﬁnished
second in the shot put and ﬁfth in

the weight’ throw. *1=’re'shman Ben '

Goetsch, who joined the indoor
track team at the conclusion of the
men’s basketball season, placed
second in the high jump, and
sophomore Drew Martin ﬁnished
third in the pole vault

The Generals 4x400 meter
relay team of Chip McCoy, Mar-
shall French, Brian Bondurant
and Matt Harrison placed third
overall, while the Distance Med-
ley Relay squad of Alex Jackson,
Harrison, Rob Saliers and Welsh
placed fourth.

Billington said the indoor sea-
son was a success, but he expects
better results as the team shifts to
outdoor competition.

“The indoor season went well
and most everyone improved
throughout the season. The team
is almost all freshmen and sopho-
mores, so we expect to improve
as we become more experienced.
 I expect our practice to pay off
as we enter the outdoor season
and hopefully we can improve,”
he said.

teamed with freshman Lauren Calre to win first doubles.

Juniors Lauren Cook and Ka-
tie Duncan were victorious at ﬁfth
and sixth singles. Cook won 6-1,
6-0, while Duncan didn’t surren-
der a single game winning 6-0,
6-0.

In doubles, Will paired with
Christmas for an 8-1 victory at
ﬁrst doubles, while Haines and
Proctor paired together for a 8-2
victory at second doubles.

Cook_and Duncan were victo-
rious as third doubles by a score
of 8-1. The team is extremely
deep, returning all of last year’s
starters.

Christmas said, “We deﬁnitely
have depth. [Head Coach] Cinda
[Rankin] schedules us two match-
es in the same day and can send
half the team to the away match
and keep half the team to play at
home.”

Not only does the team have
great depth, but it also features
girls that are capable of playing
anywhere in the lineup, depend-
ing on the opponent.

Weston added, “We are fortu-
nate to have a team with depth.
Regardless of what position
someone plays they still are able

to compete strongly at their posi-
tion or at a higher position against
various teams.”

Aside from their demeanor
on the courts and the perennial
dynasty that the Generals have
established, the team is close off
the court too.

Weston said, “We have a team
with great chemistry, which has
deﬁnitely impacted how well we
have done in previous years. Not
only are we teammates but we
are very good friends. Being so
close to everyone on the team is
probably the greatest strength we
have besides having talented ten-
nis players,” she said.

Intercollegiate experience is
not the only place where the Gen-
erals have expertise.

Woitham said‘, “I think one of
the greatest aspects of our team
is that everyone is a great tennis

player and comes in with a solid

junior career behind her. We,
therefore, we have so much depth
on our team that we constantly
push our teammates to be better.”

The Generals are a highly
talented team, with players that
come in with an extensive back-
ground in the sport. The players
also have different styles of play,
which is a major strength.

Bouret said, “Our team is ﬁlled
with so many players of different
playing styles, which makes us a
very tough team to play against.”

With three seniors in the top
six for the Generals, there is a
great deal of leadership on the
team, which is excellent for the
younger players on the team.

— Bouret said, “Our seniors have
been so supportive and serve as
great role models for the rest of
the team. I’m very happy to be
a freshman on such a talented
team; it deﬁnitely keeps me on

my toes.”

The Generals also have a new
assistant coach who has been
helping the team out in various
different ways.

Christmas said, “Doubles hurt
us last season, so our new assis-
tant coach Eric is really helping
us work on that. I think he’s doing
a really good job of keeping us all
focused. Nationals is deﬁnitely in
the back of everyone’s minds, but
we have to focus on one match at
a time, because if you don’t teams
will surprise you.”

As the team continues with
their campaign, they have main
different goals in mind.

Tabb said, “Obviously we’re
competing against the best of the
best -- especially when we have
to play each other at individuals,
but I’d like to keep a strong re-
cord this year. And unfortunately,
the individual event takes place
right after the team event [at the
NCAA Tournament], so there’s
always the chance that you play
at the team event and have to
turn around and play a teammate,
which is a necessary evil in any
individual sport.”

W&L, currently ranked third
nationally, next returns to action

on Tuesday at Randolpph,-,Mpg)n.

I Wrestlers wrap up strong season

Young but experienced teamﬁnishes the Generals ’best conference tournament result in several years

By Mike Fahey
spams zmroa

With eight wins and the best
ﬁnish that the team has seen in
almost a decade, the Washington
and Lee wrestling team can only
take positives away from their
2006-2007 campaign.

It was a season full of accom-
plishments. With their ﬁfth place
ﬁnish out of eight teams, it was
the ﬁrst time that the Generals
had ﬁnished out oflast place since
the 1999-2000 season, and it was
W&L best result since ﬁnishing
ﬁfth at the Centennial Conference
championships during their 1998-
1998 campaign.

Also, the Generals had the
most meet victories since the
1985-1986 season, and knocked

off the top two teams in the Cen-
tennial Conference. Ursinus, one
of the teams that W&L upset,
had been undefeated in 27 con-
secutive conference matches. The
Blue and White handed Ursinus
their ﬁrst defeat of the season as
well. i

In the Centennial Conference
Championships, Ursinus, who
W&L defeated, took home team
title with 85.5 points and was fol-
lowed by Muhlenberg, another
team the Generals defeated, Johns
Hopkins, and McDaniel, yet an-
other team defeated by the Blue
and White. The Generals ﬁnished
ﬁfth with 48.0 points.

At the conference champion-
ships, the Generals had one run-
ner-up ﬁnish, three third-place
ﬁnishes and one fourth-place ﬁn-

Junior Anthony Boniello ﬁn-

pound weight class. Boniello
posted a technical fall over Kings
Point’s Trevor Muhler in the ﬁrst
round and prevailed in an 8-3
triumph over Mike Schwager of
Ursinus.

Boniello was then pinned by
Stevens Tech’s Brandon Mac-
Whinnie in the championship
bout. MacWhinnie would go on
to be named Centennial Confer-
ence Wrestler of the Year.

Juniors Jesse Sataloff and Kirk
Adamson and sophomore John

Christopher- (Fort Lauderdale,
Fla./Cardinal Gibbons) all placed
third, while junior David Shubick
took fourth place.

Sataloff, who wrestles in the
174 pound weight class, pinned
Aaron Balk of Gettysburg in the
ﬁrst round, but was pinned by
McDaniel’s Drew Winﬁeld in the
semiﬁnals. Sataloff went on to
capture the their place crown by
defeating Troy McGuinness of
Kings Point, 3-2.

Adamson, who wrestles in the
197 pound weight class, had a
major decision over Ferris Bond
of McDaniel in the ﬁrst round,

but was defeated by Muhlen-
burg’s Matt Loesch in the semiﬁ-
nals. Adamson then proceeded to
thrash Stevens Tech’s James Ro-
aity, 11-4, to ﬁnish third for the
Blue and White.

In the heavyweight divison,
Christopher downed McDaniel’s
Ryan Deiter, 5-2, in the ﬁrst
round, but was then defeated by
Joe Tartar of Muhlenberg. Chris-
topher followed that up with a 4-1
win of Jonathon Freeman of Johns
Hopkins to take the bronze.

Shubick, competing in the 133
pound weight class, was victori-
ous in his ﬁrst round match-up,

pinning Michael Sunmer of Johns
Hopkins in 4:50, but Shubick
went on to be pinned by Ursinus’
Trevor Beard in the semiﬁnal. He
then fell to McDaniel’s Steven
Colasuonno in the third-place
bout.

A young team, the Generals
will only graduate one senior,
making their prospects for next
season great. .

Adamson said, “By having
only one senior on the team, we
are in a great position for next
year. I know everyone wants to
win the conference and won’t be
satisﬁed with anything less.”

Men lose to Va.
Wes. in tourney

Up—and—down season ends for the men when they lose to

By Brlan Devlne
smrr wrmrn

Though this was one of the
best seasons in recent memory,
the Washington and Lee men’s
basketball team has seen rough
times of late.

After a promising start, in-
cluding winning the W&L Invi-
tational in December and a string
of victories against conference
opposition, the team faltered after
losing three straight conference
games by a total of eight points.
These demoralizing defeats at the
end of January and the beginning
of February were but the start of
a nine-game stretch that included
eight conference losses. These
performances dropped the Gen-
erals to 11 wins, 13 losses (6-12
in conference) and placed them
in an unenviable position for the
March ODAC postseason tourna-
ment.

In the tournament, which de-
cides the conference’s automatic
entrant to the NCAA Division
III championships, the Generals
were paired in the quarterﬁnals
with top-seeded Virginia Wesley-
an, the 2006 National Champi-
ons. The Generals had lost to the
Marlins twice during the season,
by 24 points in December and
I2'in February. This time was
no different, as VWC advanced
82-48 on the strength of a 25-4
run in the second half that wid-
ened a gap that was as narrow as
seven points before the halfway

mark. The Marlins forced the
Generals out of their comfortable
half—court oﬁ°ense with a high-
pressure defense. The early lead
and the fast pace set by Wesleyan
made the Generals play catch-up,
a situation that was nigh impos-
sible given the Marlins’ stingy
defense. In the end W&L was
simply outclassed by their oppo-
nents.

The Generals were once again
led by the steady play of junior
forward Greg Bienemann of Cha-
tham, NJ, who ﬁnished the Wes-
leyan game with 1,014 points in
his career. He is the ﬁrst W&L
player to record a four digit ca-
reer total since 1996, and Biene-
mann has another year to add to
his number.

Though Bienemann’s totals
are remarkable, it is unlikely that

he will enter the W&L record V

books for career points as he
would need an additional thou-
sand points to approach the all-
time school record.

Bienemann’s performance
against the Marlins in the quarter-
ﬁnal, held at the Salem Civic Cen-
ter west of Roanoke, was slightly
below his average, a modest 16
points and 13 rebounds, both of
which were highs for the team.
No other player for the Gener-
als reached double ﬁgures in any
category, as Wesleyan showed
why they were ranked second in
the country in Division III and
were the top seed in the confer-
ence tournament. The Marlins

the defending national champions in the ODAC touranment

had four players in double ﬁgures
and held the Generals to their
second-lowest point total of the
season. Wesleyan senior center
Brandon Adair, the ODAC Player
of the Year as a junior, registered
ﬁfteen points and seven rebounds,
while his teammate Ton Ton Ba-
lenga added ﬁfteen and six to his
account.

Adair had totaled 44 points
against the Generals in their pre-
vious two meetings. Wesleyan
would go on to lose the con-
ference semiﬁnal against ﬁfth-
seeded Hampden—Sydney, . the
eventual tournament champions,
but they received an at-large bid
to the NCAA tournament based
on their 23-4 overall record and
should remain highly ranked na-
tionally.

Though the loss is disappoint-
ing for the Generals, even reach-
ing the ODAC tournament was
an improvement on last year. The
11-14 record set by the team this
year is W&L’s best in sixteen
years. Bienemann added to his list
of accomplishments last week, as
well, when he was named to the
all-ODAC ﬁrst team along with
Adair.

Bienemann is the only Gen-
erals player honored by the con-
ference this year. He ﬁnishes the
season with 445 points, an aver-
age of 17.8 points per game, and
leads the team for the season in
points, rebounds, minutes played,
ﬁeld goals, free throws and per-
sonal fouls.

Gir1’s lax already
off to a quick start

After a training trip to Dallas, the women defeated No. 13
St. Mary 3 and then beat Roanoke and Randolph-Macon

By Russweems
STAFF WRITER

The women’s lacrosse team
had a big week, defeating their
ﬁrst two conference opponents.
The Generals look to be one of
the best in the ODAC again. They
won the conference last year and
are working to accomplish that
goal again.

Sophomore Kelsi Robinson
said of the team, “We are so ex-
cited for the season and would

_love to win the ODAC again, but,

as always, we take it one game at
a time and try not to get ahead of
ourselves.”

W&L ﬁelds another strong
team this year with some key up-
perclassmen leaders and some
impressive young talent.

Wednesday the Generals faced
the Roanoke Maroons in their ﬁrst
ODAC game. With three starters
sick, the Generals knew they had
to step it up.

After Roanoke scored the ﬁrst
goal, W&L rolled off ﬁve straight
goals and took a 5-2 lead at half
time. ‘

The second half started slow
as the Maroons cut the lead to 6-
4. The Generals then ratcheted up
the pace to a level the Maroons
could not handle. W&L went on
their second ﬁve goal run of the
game, tallying the ﬁnal ﬁve goals
of the game to secure an 11-4 vic-
tory.

Throughout the contest, the
Generals played solid defense and
connected well in the midﬁeld.
The attackers also had a good

showing. Key individual contri-
butions were made by sophomore
attacker Kelsi Robinson with
two goals and two assists, fresh-
man attacker Britten Matthews
with three goals and sophomore
attacker Katie Flippen with ‘two
scores. Senior midﬁelder Kelly
Evans tallied a goal and an assist
and senior attacker Avery Love-
joy had two assists.

Between the pipes, junior Sar-
ah Tilbor accumulated ﬁve saves,
and sophomore Ali Hillyard also
had a stop. The Generals were
happy to start out their season on
a positive note and look forward
to a strong showing in the ODAC
again this year.

Saturday, fresh off their ﬁrst
conference win, the Generals
went up against ODAC rival,
Randolph-Macon. This is always
a tough, intense game, and W&L
was ready for the challenge.

The Generals started the ﬁrst
half hot, taking a 7-2 advantage at
the break, lead by three of Kelly
Evan ’s game-high four goals. The
team’s strong defense and potent

offense kept the Yellow Jackets
off balance throughout the half.

After the break, the lead got as
low as three goals at 9-6 due to
some “sloppy play,” as one player
put it.

However, the Generals refo-
cused and closed the game strong
to leave with a 13-7 win. Aside
from Evan’s big performance,
Kelsi Robinson also added four
points with three goals and an as-
sist.

Sophomore Colleen Evans

also had a solid showing with.

three points (two goals and an as-
sist). Sarah‘Tilbor and Ali Hilyard
again shared the time in goal with
Tilbor recording four saves, and
Hilyard stopping two.

Next week, the Generals take
on their toughest competition yet
when seventh.-ranked Franklin
and Marshall comes to Lexing-
ton for a non-conference matchup
of two annual powerhouses. The
eleventh ranked Generals are
looking forward to a solid perfor-

mance to prove they deserve to be

a top ten team.

eral’s lone scoring swim-
mer, junior Evan Fitzgerald,
who ﬁnished eighth. Wingate
shocked the Generals in the
800 Free Relay, out-touching
the team of Brett Tatman, Alex
Sweet, Brandon Bamds and
Paul Crook by nine-tenths of a
second to give Wingate a six
point advantage going into the
ﬁnal day of competition.

“We were a little shocked
to be losing,” said Paul Crook.
“Wingatebrought in an incred-
ibly strong freshmen class,
which made the meet much
closer this year.”

The ﬁnal day’s ﬁrst event
was the 1650 Free. Even
though Wingate’s Matthew
Dugan won the event, Fresh-
men Jonathan Giesen and Dan
Austin had excellent swims,
taking second and fourth for
W&L. Mike Ginder captured
the 100 backstroke title in
the next event, out-touching
Wingate’s Brian Parks by six
tenths of a second to ﬁnish in
1:49.94.

“Mental toughness was the
key to success on the ﬁnal day.
We didn’t let the fact that we
were losing get to us. Instead,
we used it as motivation to
swim even faster,” said Paul
Crook. “Plus, when you have
20 of your teammates going
and cheering hard for every
race on the pool deck, it’s hard

Men's Swimming:

not to go fast.”

The Championship Heat of
the 100 Free was one of the
most important swims of the
meet.

“The 100 free was an
intense race,” said David
Croushore. “Before the race
in the ready room, not a word
was spoken, as four Generals,
three Wingate Bulldogs, and
one third party understood the
signiﬁcance of that race.”

Even though Sweet broke
the school record and quali-
ﬁed for nationals, ﬁnishing in
45.40, he came up short of the
title as Wingate’s Gus Chagas
won the race. However, the
Generals took fourth, ﬁfth, and
sixth, giving them the higher
point total for the event.

“The key races were any
race where we went up against
a Wingate guy,” Sweet said.
“We always had to make sure
that we beat them out in the
morning to get into ﬁnals and
then swim well at night to beat
them again.”

Wingate wasn’t ﬁnished
yet. In the 200 Breaststroke,
Sergey Vlashchenko and Kyle
Corcoran ﬁnish ﬁrst and sec-
ond to keep them in the meet.

In the 200 Fly, the fresh-
man duo of Winston Stagg and
Josh Gonzalez ﬁnished third
and fourth. Evan Fitzgerald,
having already swam the 200
Backstroke earlier in the eve-
ning, out-touched Wingate’s
Carlos Jones for 13”‘ place.

Team is looking forward
to rematch with Hopkins

One of the differences in
the meet was “having Evan
swimming up in the 200 back
and 200 ﬂy on the same day,”
said Tim McGlaston.

“Winston Stagg and Josh
Gonzalez’s swims at the end
of the last day was vital,” said
Alex Sweet. “They both beat
two Wingate swimmers
which secured us a victory in
the meet.”

In the competition’s ﬁ-
nal event, the 400 Freestyle
Relay, W&L’s foursome of
Sweet, Tim McGlaston, David
Croushore, and Mike Ginder
sealed the team victory by
winning in a provisional cut
time of 3:04.49, good enough
for a school and meet record.
The win gave the Generals a
total of 755 points to Wing-
ate’s 733.

At the conclusion of the
meet, seven Generals had
qualiﬁed for nationals, giving
them a chance at the school’s
ﬁrst top-ﬁve ﬁnish.

Nationals will be
March 15-17 in Houston.

“Our goal for nationals is
to swim fast, bottom line. Last
year we were just happy to go,
this year we have determina-
tion to become a dominant

held

- swimming threat year in and

year out at nationals,” said
Alex Sweet. “Every race is
key, and if we can bring back
one or more relay or individ-
ual national championships,
that would be great too.”

THE RING-TUM PHI ' 9

Baseball kicks off season in winning fashion

The men’s baseball team has been off to a great start in their 2007 campaign. Senior Clayton Edwards
pitched a complete-game shutout and went 3-for-5 with two RBls as the Generals swept a doubleheader
rom Emory & Henry. The Generals took the first game, 6-0 and then won the second contest 16-14. In the
ﬂrst game, W&L was led by junior James Madden, who went 1-for-4 with two RBI and the homerun, and
junior Tlm Llvlngston, who hit 2-for-3 with one RBI. Edwards hurled all seven Innings in the first game of
the doubleheader, racking up 11 strikeouts and only four hits and three walks.

Laxers off to slow start

Men come up short against second ranked Gettysburg on Saturday

By Madeline Gent
surr wnmzn

Eugene McCabe’s ﬂrst win
as head coach of the Washington
and Lee men’s lacrosse team was
bittersweet, as it was sandwiched
between two rough losses for the
Generals.

Washington and Lee opened
its season ranked sixteen in the
preseason polls but fell out of the
top twenty alter suffering a 6-5
defeat at the hands of Cabrini.

The Generals entered halftime

with a lead but were held score— _

less in the second half. A strong
defense was not enough to stop
the 20"‘ ranked Cavaliers, who
scored two goals in the third and

\ fourth quarters.

“We were upset about the way
we played because we couldn’t
do anything offensively, which
was tough,” said junior attacker
Ned Rider.

McCabe recorded his ﬂrst win
as a head coach of the Generals
with a 9-3 victory over visiting
York College this past Wednes-
day.

The Generals dominated the
ﬁrst half, holding York to only
one goal while scoring eight of
their own. The second half saw
the Generals battling.

“They played a zone 85 per-
cent of the game. We struggled to
get into rhythm,” noted McCabe.

The Generals are still look to
bring their offense up to a more
consistent level after they only
managed two goals in the second
half against York.

With a young offense ﬁghting
to put an entire game together, a
positive light shone in the form
of junior long—stick defenseman
Spotty Robins.

Fellow teammate Rider said,
“Spotty is playing really well.
He is really consistent more than
anyone on the team... He’s been
playing awesome and I would

say he is the best long pole in the
league.”

Robins notched his ﬁrst goal
of the season against Cabrini.
“Spotty played a great defense,
scored a goal, and overall really
stepped up his game,” said Me-
Cabe.

Also on defense, senior goalie
Chris Lalli recorded 14 saves
against the York offense. “We
came out on a Wednesday and
played hard... We were up 8-1
at halftime, and it was tough for
them to come back from a deﬁcit
when Lalli is playing so well,”
noted senior defenseman and cap-
tain Peter Goodwin. “It was good
to get coach his ﬁrst win.”

On Saturday, W&L hosted
number two ranked Gettysburg.
Again struggling to put a full
game together, the Generals lost
sight of a victory in the ﬂrst half
and went into halftime with an
eight goal deﬁcit. “Offensively
we need to mature and grow a
little,” said McCabe. “It was an
average performance.”

The Generals’ average perfor-
mance was no match for the ﬁrst
half speed of the Bullets. Taking
the opportunities when available,
Gettysburg converted numerous
strong defensive plays into offen-
sive hustle.

“We let them get goals early
and we couldn’t really recover,”
noted Goodwin. “We had a good
game plan which we executed in
the second half. We let them get
some transition goals in the ﬂrst
half which was something we
wanted to stop. It’s tough to go
into halftime at 9-1.”

The Generals did not score un-
til the Bullets gained a 5-0 lead.
Sophomore attacker Harry St.
John had the ﬁrst goal with 7:54
left to play in the first half of the
game. “The bulk of our leader-
ship is on defense,” said McCabe,
referring to his thirteen returning
seniors, “We have strong recruit-

We came out on a Wednesday and played

hard... We were up 8-1 at halftime, and it was

tough for them to come back from a deﬁcit

when Lalli is playing so well.

PETER GOODWIN, senlor captaln
 

ing classes and these young gmys
just need to step it up.”

The second half saw a drastic
change in the play of the Gener-
als. They kept up with their op-
ponents, picking up their game
both offensively and defensively.
Only outscored by one goal in
the second period, the Generals’
younger offense showed great
potential. “We played a lot bet-
ter in the second half. We moved
the ball better, we picked it up and
the ball feeding improved,” said
Rider. “We realized we could play
with them the second half, but it
was too late.”

“We have a lot of young guys
so we just need to learn from it.
We got better yesterday, and we
have a good opportunity to go
forward this coming weekend
against Washington College,”
said Goodwin.

When asked what was next for
the blue and white, McCabe was
on the same page as his captain.
“We are going to prepare for next
week and get better for Washing-
ton College.” The Generals look
to improve their record and get
another win for the new coach this
Saturday, March 10 in a 7:00 p.m.
game at Washington College.

The reason
why people

are SO

much

taller today

The actual reason for increase in average
height in America can be blamed on ballers

By Adam Lewis and Russ
Weems
snrr wnnrns

Since 1960, the average height
of a United States citizen between
the ages of 20 and 74 has risen
over an inch to approximately
69.4 inches, according to the U.S.
Department of Health and Human
Services.

And the increase in the heights
of children is even more signiﬁ-
cant. Now, it may seem like this
change is due to improvements
in diets, technology, lifestyles,
medicine, etc.

But what if we were to tell
you that I knew the exact cause of
this, and ﬁirther, that diets, life-
styles, and medicine are merely
cover-ups for the real scapegoat:
the NBA?

Founded in 1946, the National
Basketball Association has boast-
ed the world’s most talented, rich-
est, and yes, tallest athletes ever.

But what sometimes gets swept
under the rug is that these athletes
are also some of the planet’s most
sexually active human beings.

Combine that with the fact that
they are extremely tall, and there
is my reasoning why the change
in human height is due strictly to
the NBA.

Having said this, let’s take
some actual statistics into ac-
count.

In his autobiography, Wilt
Chamberlin claimed to have slept
with 20,000 women, and we will
assume that he abided by the
Washington and Lee Honor Sys-
tem when he stated this.

Clearly, because “Wilt the
Stilt” is regarded as one of the
best players of all-time, he prob-
ably did better with the ladies
than the majority of other athletes
in his sport.

I mean, let’s face it, the nick-
name “Wilt the Stilt” could only
mean one thing.

Given this, let’s assume that
other NBA players only sleep
with an average of 5,000 women,
a generously low estimate con-
sidering it is merely a quarter of
Chamberlin’s count.

While he was indeed superior
to almost all athletes in the league,
it is obvious that with new training
and technology, modem-day pro-
fessional basketball players have
greater than 25% of Chamberlin’s
athletic ability.

And moreover, with all the
new pick—up lines, online servic-
es, and brands of alcohol, these
players are probably not much
worse in the seduction realm than
Wilt was.

However in spite of this, we
will keep this minute number of
5,000, giving “the Stilt” some
well-eamed respect.

As of 2001, 51 out of every
1,000 women experienced an
unintended pregnancy according
to “Perspectives on Sexual and
Reproductive Health.” That is
an unplanned pregnancy rate of
roughly 5%. » ~

A Now, if we stick with the esti-
mated number of women that the
average NBA athlete fomicates
with, it would hold that there are
approximately 250 children cre-
ated per NBA player.

And this is assuming that none
of these players throw a “pimp
game” that is at all comparable to
that of “Wilt the Stilt.”

Moving on, there are 450 pro-
fessional basketball players cur-
rently in the NBA.

With the mean rate of procre-
ation amongst these athletes of
250 children per, the total number
of olfspring produced by current
NBA-ers would be 112,500.

Yes, that is quite a number,
but it is clearly based on factual
proof so there should be no dis-
crepancy.

In conclusion, I think I have
made it pretty evident that chang-
es in food, lifestyle, and medicine
have little if any impact on the
overall increase in height.

It is obvious that the mem-
bers of the NBA are responsible,
whose abhorrently pimpish life-
styles have accounted for over
100,000 children, all of whom are
(and will be) signiﬁcantly taller.

Wait a second. Oh my God. I
am 6’2”. Does that mean my dad
is Shawn Bradley?

Men take down rival

Men is tennis opens spring season with victories over three ODA C squads and rival, Sewanee

ByMlke Fahey
SPORTS EDITOR

Aﬁer a road trip around the
southeastern part of America
that resulted in utter domina-

» tion over an ODAC opponent, a

close contest with a Division I
foe,and a solid win against a pc-
rennial rival, the Washington and
Lee men’s tennis team is off to a
great start to its 2007 campaign.

This past week, the Generals
took on ODAC opponent Lynch-
burg College and local opponent
Ferrum College, a team that the
Generals had never played.

W&L dominated both con-
tests, failing to lose a single match
against either opponent.

Against Lynchburg, junior
Seth Feibelman was victorious
at ﬁrst singles, while junior Nat
Estes won at second singles. Both
Feibelman and Estes won 6-1, 6-
O.

Sophomore Jamie McCardell
was victorious at third singles,
and senior Andrew Ellison won
fourth singles.

Freshmen Cliff Gaddy and
Parker Swenson saw action for the
Generals at ﬁﬁh and sixth singles
respectively for the Generals.

Both won in straight sets. The
Generals also swept doubles ac-
tion as F eibelrnan paired with Es-
tes for an 8-1 .victory, while Mc-
Cardell paired with senior captain
Jon Malooly for an 8-2 victory at
second doubles.

Freshman Alex Brooke paired
with Ellison for an 8-2 victory at
third doubles for the Generals.

The match against Ferrum saw
junior Tim Ross win at ﬁrst sin-
gles for the Generals, 6-0, 6-4.

Feibelman and Estes won at
second and third singles for the
Generals, dominating their op-
ponents.

Malooly and McCardell were
victorious at fourth and ﬁﬁh sin-
gles respectively. Malooly did not
lose a single game.

Junior Stuart Sanford was
victorious at sixth singles for the
Generals posting a 6-0, 6-0 vic-
tory.

The Generals’ biggest victory
of the season came over Feb Break
when the team traveled to Tennes-
see to take on Sewanee, winning
by the close score of 6-3.

Ross had to play three sets in
order to defeat Charlie Boyd in
ﬁrst singles, 5-7, 6-0, 6-4.

Feibelman and Estes captured
second and third singles in straight
sets. Malooly was also victorious
at fourth singles for the Generals
winning 6-2, 6-3.

In doubles action, Ross and
Estes paired up to win ﬁrst dou-
bles 8-4, while Malooly and Mc-
Cardell teamed up to win second
doubles 8-2.

It has been a very strong start
to the season for the Generals.

Malooly said, “The team has
improved dramatically since we
started practicing a few weeks
ago, and it showed in our con-
vincing win over Sewanee.”'

For a team to be successful on
the courts, it takes many different
elements. First the team must have
a certain degree of chemistry.

Malooly said, “I think there
is good team chemistry this year,
which has made our team stron-
ger. The whole team is moti-
vated to practice hard and try to
improve. Good communication

I think there is good team chemistry this

year, which has made our team stronger.

The whole team is motivated to practice

hard and try to improve.

JON MALOOLY. senlor captaln

between the players and coach
Detwiler have allowed for quality
practices where everyone can get
better.”

Experience is another element
important for success. The Gener-
al-s are a very young team, but at
the same time, each of their top
players had a tremendous amount
of match experience.

Estes said, “Our strengths
deﬁnitely include our experience,
since many of the players have
match experience, including ﬁve
or so juniors and a senior recover-
ing from surgery.”

A ﬁnal strength for the Gener-
als comes in the form of depth.
Having a talented squad allows
for a multitude of different play-
ers to be able to compete on any
given day.

Junior Nelson Bunn said, “We
have solid guys all the way down
the lineup. I feel that any of us
could challenge one another on
the court at any given time. An-
other strength this year is team
bonding. The February Break trip
[across the southeast] united us as
a team.”

This season has brought a few
changes to the Generals.

Fundamentally, scoring will
not be conducted differently, with

doubles matches now counting
for three points total, rather than
only one point being contended in
the doubles matches.

Malooly said, “The ultimate
goal is to improve our games and
advance past the second round
of the NCAA tournament, where
we have lost for the past several
years.”

A ﬁnal change that the team
has witnessed is an additional
strength within the region as evi-
denced through the fall season.

Estes said, “I would say that
the impression that we got from
our fall season was that the oth-
er teams in our region got much
stronger this year, and that we
should have plenty of tough
matches this year.”

However, given the success
of the season so far this year, the
Generals‘ will be up-to the task
against any opponent.

Malooly said, “The team
played very well in [their match-
es] and was ready to compete. Ev-
eryone was very focused on their
matches and we were able to pull
out a victory.”

The Generals will return to ac-
tion on Tuesday when they travel
to Randolph-Macon to face their
ODAC foe.

Streak snapped by Macon

Women ’s swimming sees thirteen-year winning streak snapped by six points at the hands of Randolph-Macon

By Michael Keenan
su rr wn lTE a

Washington and Lee’s wom-
en’s swim team’s quest to win a
fourteenth straight ODAC cham-
pionship came up just six points
short as Randolph-Macon Col-
lege won their ﬁrst ODAC title
since ﬁrst ﬁelding a team in the
1999-2000 season.

The Generals knew they would
have a stiff challenge in their title
defense from the start.

Earlier in the season, the Gen-
erals had lost a dual meet at home
to Randolph-Macon, 135-126,
making for a charged atmosphere
at Radford.

“The atmosphere at the meet
was incredible, especially at ﬁ-
nals. In every heat, there were
Randolph-Macon swimmers and
Washington and Lee swimmers,
and you knew just how badly
each team wanted their teammate
to get their hand on the wall ﬁrst,”
said Miata.

“Cheering and celebrating
came from both teams, including
the coaches, swimmers and even
the parents. Everyone was really
into it,” Miata continued.

The Generals got off to a strong
start on Friday evening as the 200
free relay team of freshman Jenna
Worsham, junior Amy Rober-
son, sophomore Julia Miata, and
freshman Sarah Simpson ﬁnished
ﬁrst.- Sophomores Jessica Shaw
and Lindsey Strachan followed

up with fourth and ﬁfth place ﬁn-
ishes in the 500 freestyle.

“Key races were at the begin-
ning of the meet,” said Miata.
“Swimming well in the beginning
was important, because it showed
us that all the training and taper-
ing had more than prepared us to
swim well for the entire week-
end.”

In the 200 individual med-
ley, Sophomore Susan Mahoney,
Worsham, Miata, and Senior cap-
tain Abbie Sauter ﬁnished in the
top six.

Though day one ended on a
disappointing note as the Yellow
Jackets won the 400 Medley Re-
lay, the Generals still held a 188-
147 advantage. It was clear this
would be a two team meet as the
other four teams combined had
amassed only 192 total points.

“It was always between us and

. Randolph-Macon for ﬁrst place,

so the energy on deck was unbe-
lievable,” said Miata.

The Generals started out day
two equally strong. The foursome
of Strachan, Mahoney, Amy Rob-
erson, and Worsham out-touched
Randolph-Macon in the 200 Med-
ley Relay by less than six tenths
of a second for ﬁrst place.

“The 200 medley was really
a blast going into the ﬁnals: we
were seated second, and were ex-
pected to stay in that position,”
said Worsham.

“But we busted it out in the ﬁ-
nals and showed Randy-Mac just

how tough we really are. It caught
them off-guard and was an excit-
ing race up to the very last sec-
ond” Worsham contined.

In the next event, the 400 Indi-
vidual Medley, Shaw, Mahoney,
and Miata took ﬁrst, second, and
third. Shaw’s time of 4:43.78 just
missed setting a school record.

However, Randolph-Macon
kept it close by ﬁnished fourth,
ﬁfth, and sixth, and put six in the
top ten, including Shafer Busch’s
victory, in the next event the 100
ﬂy.

In the ﬁnal event of day two,
the 800 free relay, the Yellow
Jackets bested the Generals relay
of Worsham, Strachan, Mahoney,
and Simpson by just over three
seconds, cutting the General’s
lead to ten heading into the ﬁnal
day of competition.

Though Strachan won the 200
backstroke to start the ﬁnal day,
Randolph-Macon took second,
third, fourth, seventh and eighth.

In the 100 free, the Generals
were led by Jenna Worsham’s
55.94 and took third through

sixth places. Shaw placed second
and Sauter, in her ﬁnal collegiate
event, took third for the Generals
in the 200 breaststroke.

Though Miata won the 100
Fly in a time of2: 17.30, with only
one event remaining the General
were too far behind to stage a last-
event comeback.

“The 400 freestyle relay was
memorable,” said Worsham. “Go-
ing into it, some of us knew we
had already lost even if we did
win the relay and this is when it
began to sit in with me that the
streak was over. But we weren’t
thinking about that.”

Worsham continued, “It was
just another race for us, so we
gave it everything we had left,
which turned out to be a lot more
than they had left.

“We had been yelling our guts
out all weekend cheering, and
I’ve never‘heard the team yell
that loud before” Worsham con-
tinued.

The yelling worked as the
foursome of Worsham, Mahoney,
Simpson and Strachan took

ﬁrst place, ﬁnishing in a time of
3:44.20.

“I think that this victory made
the following 20 minutes of ac-
cepting defeat more bearable for
us all,” said Worsham.

“We won the event for the ﬁ-
nal relay and ﬁnal event of the
meet, the 400 free relay. But even
after the Randolph-Macon team
touched the wall, that side of the
pool began cheering. Right then,
I knew who had truly won the
meet,” said Miata. “Losing by
six points is nothing at a swim
meet; it’s the difference between
a swimmer moving up two places,
or a relay moving up one place.
It was so hard to accept that the
winning streak had ended. It just
didn’t seem real at ﬁrst.”

At the end of the meet, Ran-
dolph-Macon had amassed 609
points to the General’s 603.

“I think the team is satisﬁed
with their performance. A lot of
people seem to focus on the fact
that we broke a 13-year win-
ning streak, but that does not do
justice to every girl’s individual
performances. So many people
had life time bests, moved up in
place during ﬁnals or just had
unbelievably strong and impres-
sive races,” said Miata. “So indi-
vidually, we did some incredible
things, and as a team, we realize
that having four less people to
score points automatically puts
us at a disadvantage. We fought
hard, and although we didn’t walk

away with the gold, we swam the
best we could.”

“We are content with our own
performance as a team. I mean,
we out-swam Randolph Macon,
out-fought them, and out-cheered
them. In every way a team can
be better-we were the best.” said
Worsham. “And that’s what mat-
ters when you get to the core of it.
But in the end, it was a game of
numbers, and they had the upper-
hand in that case.”

The Generals are only losing
one senior to graduation and are
looking to start a new streak next
year

“We are more than prepared
to start a new winning streak next
year. Not only has this meet made
us realize that someone is always
going to come after us, but it also
made us angry, said Miata. “The
tension between the rivalry has
escalated so much within the past
year, and we want Randolph-Ma-
con to know that we are not go-
ing to go down without a ﬁght.
Reclaiming the ODAC title will
probably be the most important
goal for us as a team next year,
and there’s no doubt in my mind
that we will put Randy-Mac back
in their place.

Miata continued, “It’s good
that they have a brief feeling of
victory, and I hope they remember
it for a long time, because they’re
not going to get it back again for a
while. We’ll be ready to dominate
next year.”

THE RING-TUM PHI ' 11

  Va. Wes. finishes
   women’s season

Team ﬁnishes with 1 6-1] record while senior
Jessica Hunsinger sets ODAC rebound record

By Kevin Trempe
STAFF WRITER

Taking advantage of veteran
leadership and dominating front
court play, the Washington and
Lee women’s basketball team
capped off a record-breaking sea-
son last week.

Although the 2006-07 cam-
paign ended with a disappointing
loss to Virginia Wesleyan in the
second round of the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference Champi-
onship, no one will argue that the
season was one of the best in the
program’s short history. '

Coming into the season, few
outside the W&L locker room ex-
pected the program to enjoy the
success it did. The team lost three
seniors from a 2005-06 squad that
went 11-15, and W&L had not
won an ODAC tournament game
since 1999.

However, the Generals were
able to return some key players,
namely senior center Jessica Hun-
singer and junior guard Kristen
Krouchick.

Through their contributions
and the addition of a strong fresh-
man class, the Generals began the
season well, winning the Swarth-
more Tip-oﬂ‘ tournament on the
way to a 3-1 record out of the
gate. Although a six-game los-

ing streak during conference play
put the Generals’ hopes of reach-
ing the conference tournament in
jeopardy, the team responded by
winning 12 out of their ﬁnal 15
regular season games.

That streak included an histor-
ic ﬁrst for W&L, as they knocked

off 24th-ranked Bridgewater’

on Jan. 20, the ﬁrst win over a
ranked opponent in the program’s
history. In the ﬁrst round of the
ODAC Tournament, the Generals
drew Eastern Mennonite Univer-
sity, a team that had dealt W&L
two losses earlier in the season.

Behind 16 points and a sea-
son—high 12 rebounds by junior
forward Haley James, the Gener-
als ﬁnally bested EMU when it
mattered the most, taking a 53-
43 victory over the third-seeded
Royals.

The thrill of the victory was
short-lived, however, as W&L
lost in the second round to Virgin-
ia Wesleyan by a score of 73-62.

Hunsinger scored 12 points

and grabbed nine rebounds in

what would be her ﬁnal game,

and Krouchick red the Gene'ra‘ls.«-T

with 14 points.

Despite the disappointing ﬁn-
ish, one cannot overlook the re-
cord-setting season that preceded
it. W&L ﬁnished at 16-11, the
best record in program history.

Other records broken include
most points in a game (with a
90-26 victory over Hollins) and
longest winning streak (seven
games).

Krouchick led the team in
scoring with 13.2 points per game
and added 6.8 boards a game.

With 99 blocked shots this
season, Jessica Hunsinger shat-
tered W&L season and career re-
cords for blocks, and ﬁnished the
season as the ﬁfth most proliﬁc
shot-blocker in Division III. She
averaged 3.7 blocks per game.

Hunsinger ﬁnished just shy of
averaging a double-double as she
scored 12.5 points per game and
hauled in an average of 9.9 re-
bounds each contest.

Hunsinger also became the
ﬁrst General to reach 1,000 career
rebounds, and her 1,046 career
boards set an Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference record. For their
efforts, Krouchick and Hunsinger
were named to the All-ODAC
Second Team.

Rowing team is back on the Water

After a 54 year layoff junior Parker Sheppard is working to restart the school is oldest club sport

By Mike Fahey
SPORTS EDITOR

ashington and Lee’s
oldest club sport has
found new life on cam-

pus, as the W&L Rowing Club is
beginning practices for the ﬁrst
time in over half a century.

Junior Parker Sheppard started
his quest to reinstate the club dur-
ing his freshman year.

“The club really got off the
ground last year when we got
money from the EC, which we
used to purchase a four-man shell,
four oars, and a combination
truck/trailer to carry the shells.”

Unfortunately, the equipment
didn’t come together in time to
start practicing and competing
last year, but this year, the team
has begun practicing.

After two practices in the fall,
the team has already has been
regularly practicing so far this

spring. The team will do its on
the water training at Lake Mer-
riweather, which is located near
Goshen. The lake is owned by
a local Boy Scout camp, but the
team has secured permission to
use their on site lake.

The ﬁrst rowing club founded
on campus was the ‘Albert Sid-
ney Rowing Club, named for the
Civil War General Albert Sidney
Johnston. The Harry Lee Row-
ing Club, named for “Light Horse
Harry” Lee, a Revolutionary War
general who was also Robert E.
Lee’s father, was another club
founded shortly thereafter. The
ﬁrst race between the two clubs
was in 1874.

The annual race held the week
before ﬁnals was one of the big-
gest events of the year. On the day
of the race, houses in Lexington
would display blue and red ﬂags,
the colors of the respective clubs,
and the spectators would drink

“I ’m really happy with getting people on the wa-

ter and getting people experience. I want to let

them see what its like to be in a competition. ’

PARKER SHEPPARD, Rowing Club president
 

blue and red lemonade at the race.
Members of the clubs would com-
pete to paint the statue of George
Washington atop of Washington
Hall either blue or red. I
The last race between the
two clubs was in 1953. Some-
time thereaﬁer, an irate ﬁsherman
broke into the boathouse and de-
stroyed the teams’ shells with a
shotgun. A few students tried to
revive the Rowing Club in 1988,
but it never got off the ground.
The team is made up'of 20
students, both men and women
alike. Though the team only had
two practices together in the fall,

Sheppard competed in the Novice
Men’s Single Scull at the Head of
the Potomac, placing second and
won the same event at the Chatta-
nooga Head Race, defeating oars-
men from Tulane and Georgia
Tech.

Sheppard started sculling
— rowing with two oars, one in
each hand — this summer while in
Lexington. The club competes in
sweep boats, in which each rower
has only one oar.

As practices continue, the
team plans to go to the Occoquan
Sprints in Lorton, Va. on April 1.

Sheppard has many goals as

the season continues. “This year
I’m really happy with- getting
people on the water and getting
people experience. I want to let
them see what it’s like to be in a
competition.”

Sheppard’s largest goal is to
bring back the Albert Sidney-Har-
ry Lee race, which has historical
signiﬁcance on campus. “When I
came as a freshman, I visited the
summer before freshmen year to
look for possible rowing places.
I did research on the past teams
and found out about the Albert
Sidney-Harry Lee race, and it’s
something that I’ve wanted to get
started ever since then.”

Rowing Club Vice President
Julie Mancini has always been an
oarswoman.

“l was on crew in high school,
and I love the sport. Not being
‘able to row on an already estab-
lished teams was one of the sac-
riﬁces I made in coming to W&L,

but I think it’s going to be just as

rewarding in helping bring back

crew here,” she said.

Sheppard is also in contact "

with Stewart Bracken ’54, an

alumnus who’s trying to garner .

support from oarsmen that com-
peted in the Generals last season
in 1953. Roger Mudd ’50 and
Robert Huntley ‘50, former Presi-
dent of W&L and namesake of
the Commerce School, competed
for the Generals in the 1950s.
Mancini also has her own set
of goals for the Generals: “This
season, we just want to make sure
that everyone gets a taste of what
crew is all about, which isn’t just
an erg machine facing a wall in
the gym. Everyone should get
a chance to get out on the water
within the coming weeks, and
we’ll get some practices in. We’d
like to get everyone comfortable
enough on the water to actually
go to a regatta later this spring.”

Washington and Lee’s men’s
swim team overcame a ﬁve point
deﬁcit to Wingate University
on the ﬁnal day of the three day
competition to claim the Blue-
grass Mountain Conference title.
The meet was not expected to be
this competitive, especially with
Wingate since Wingate’s men’s
team is only a year old.

“We knew that Wingate would
offer some good competition and
we were conﬁdent that we had
what it took to win, but we did not
expect to trail after day two,” said
Senior David Croushore.

“We thought it would be
competitive, but Wingate really
stepped up and swam very well,”
said Junior Alex Sweet. “They
had a couple foreign guys who
they gave scholarships to and had
just become eligible, so we didn’t
know what to expect from them.”

The Generals got off to a
strong start on the ﬁrst day of
competition. In the ﬁrst event of
Thursday evening, the foursome

Women start strong

Women is tennis team opens with two big victories over ODAC foes

By Mike Fahey
SPORTS EDITOR

To play two tennis matches
in the same day for any intercol-
legiate team is ,a staggering chal-
lenge. Even more so, to play two
tennis matches at the same time
in different locations would seem
to be impossible. However, the
Washington and Lee women’s
tennis team is clearly an excep-
tion to this rule due to their ex-
treme depth and uncanny ability.

The Generals opened their
season this past Wednesday fac-
ing conference foes Hollins and
Lynchburg. The Generals took on
Hollins at home on their indoor
courts at the Duchusois Tennis
Center, while the other half of
the team traveled to Lynchburg to
take on their ODAC opponent.

The most staggering statistic
is that over the course of the 18
matches played on Wednesday,
the Generals only lost 17 games.

The Generals, who made it all

the way to the NCAA Division III
team championship game, before
falling to archrival Emory, clearly
have revenge on their mind as
their season begins.

Sophomore Tori Christmas
said, “We really really want na-
tionals bad. We pretty much have
the same team as last year, with a
few strong additions like Lauren
Caire and Katie Bouret, and with
many seniors in the starting line
up, this is the year to do it. It was
hard beating Emory in the regu-
lar season on Easter last year and
then losing to them in the ﬁnals
of nationals. We are deﬁnitely out
for revenge.”

In the match against, Hollins,
the Generals dominated, losing
only two games in singles com-
petition, and surrendering only
four games in doubles action.
The Generals were led by sopho-
more Katie Tabb, who played ﬁrst
singles and was victorious 6-1,
6-0. Senior Ginny Wortham was
dominant at second singles for the

Juniors Leah Weston and Re-

fashion. Weston dropped only

Timmis blanked her opponent 6-

chair Niki Tsiknakis said. "They
are impressi\'e. while staying
minimal and avoiding the tacky
look that dominated l’ancy Dress
in years,past."'

This l00"‘ anni\'ersary of Fan-
cy Dress at Waslrirrgtorr and Lee
University catered to every gener-
ation and style. This year's theme
was a black and wlrite masquer-
ade ball. The theme was decided
by the l’anc_v I)ress committee in
the fall.

“We wanted the 100"‘ anrriver-
sary of Fancy Dress to take cen-

a

ter stage, not the theme choice,’
Tsiknakjs said. “Black and white
balls are extremely classic events,
and we were inspired speciﬁcally
by Truman Capote’s black and
white masquerade ball held in
1963 at the Plaza Hotel.”

Tsiknakis also said the mas-
querade theme was chosen to
honor the very first Fancy Dress
in 1907, which was a masquerade
ball.

This year, according to senior
co-chair Lily De Grazia, the Fan-

lcy Dress Committee was given

a budget of $90,000. She said
$4,000 came from the Execu-
tive Committee, and the rest was
earned from ticket sales.

Sticking to the theme of
Fancy Dress is rare, but
there were quite a few

all the elegance intended by
the theme.

. EC may soon hold assault hearings

President-elect Josh Payne says EC will issue statement explaining new policies

By Wes 0’Dell
STAFF WRITER

“First and foremost, I’m a
W&L student," says the new
Presiderrt-Elect of the Execu-
tive Committee, Joshua Payne.
“Someone who considers W&L a
second alma mater and someone
who believes strongly enough in
the ideals ofthis place to serve on
the EC for two years."

But ask most students, and
you ﬁnd they recognize Payne — a
second year law student — mostly
ﬁ‘om his campaign posters that
have appeared around campus
over the last few days. And that’s
one of several things he aims to
change.

Both he and fellow law stu-
dent Jane I/edlie, the newly-elect-
ed EC secretary, ran on platforms
of increased conrmunication with
the student body and proactive
EC action to identify and address
student concerns.

Ledlie said. “It always feels
like student leaders are every-
where during election time,
so why not do the sa.rne thing
throughout the year? I want the
student body to really know the
EC members, and I want us to re-
ally know them."

Payne’s solution lies largely in
his proposed Presidents Council
of Student Leaders. an advisory
body that would regularly meet
with the EC to advise it on “what
students care about" so that the
EC can better serve as an “elfee-
tive advocate for students."

According to Payne. the PCSL

will help the EC “do its job as the
student government. . .doir1g more
than just funding orgarrizatiorrs--~
helping support them throughout
the year as well.”

Another major issue this year
was what role the EC should play
in cases of sexual assault.

Junior Representative Marga-
ret Elkjns ﬁrst raised the issue in
her campaign: “It most deﬁnitely
is a breach of the community‘s
trust,” she said. “We can‘t codify
the honor system, but ifsorneone
wanted to bring it before us. . .I‘d
be more than happy to hear that."

“When I talked about it the
feedback I received was very pos-
itive,” she said. However. she did
not make it the central issue ofher
campaign.

Payne also campaigned on the

issue prior to Wednesday's rurroll‘

elections. In an interview with the
Phi, he announced publicly for
the ﬁrst time that he had drafted a

‘‘[Sexual assault] most definitely is a breach of

the community is trust... if someone wanted to

bring it before us... I ’d be more than happy to

hear that. ”

Margaret Elkins, EC Secretary

 

statcrnent for the EC condemning
sexual assaultsas “discordant with
the principles of honor at W&L.”

'lhe statement would explicitly
state for the ﬁrst time the right of
victims ofsexual assault to allege
an honor violation in front of the
EC: "the victim is free, as anyone
is...to come to us and allege an
honor violaiiorrf’ he said.

He is quick to note, though,
that “the EC is incapable of com-
ing forward and saying that some-
thing is an honor violation before
a hearing.“’ as the EC must con-
sider each individual case in light
of what the “current generation”
considers an HV.

"However. we go on to note
that the SFHB isa specially-cre-
ated forurir for sexual assault...
issues and that the victim may

feel more comfortable going to
the SFHB,” Payne said.

The SFHB (Student-Faculty
Hearing Board) was created in
the early 1990s to handle sexual
assault and discrimination cases.

“That statement will be com-
ing out in a few weeks,” Payne
said.

In other EC news, Jordan
Campbell was elected EC Vice-
President without any opposi-
tion. He declined to comment to
the Phi. Additionally, the students
approved an amendment to the
Student Body Constitution that
would move the budget alloca-
tion process from September to
the spring.

Students also elected a new
Student Judicial Council Presi-
dent, Junior Shane Wilson. Wil-

son plans to “work with other
campus leaders to promote stu-
dent self-govemance, raise the
credibility of the SJC among all
community members, and proac-
tively seek to reduce the number
of students who face disciplinary
action at W&L.”

He stated that his efforts to
improve transparency and corri-
munication will include increased
training for SJC members. greater
outreach to the Lexington city
government and public infomra-
tion campaigns to educate stu-
dents.

Sophomore Riley Barnes, the
newly-elected SJC Secretary, said
that improving communication is
vital: “There was a lot of miscom-
munication between the students
and the SJC this last year, espe-
cially with regard to Dean Dot-
son.”

Associate Dean of Students
Brandon Dotson was recently
appointed SJC advisor, spark-
ing controversy in some quarters
about the state of student self-
government.

Wilson said he believes “the
proper role of any SJC advisor
is to provide support outside the
hearing room...I have concerns
about the administration taking

on functions formerly reserved
for students, but enjoy work-
ing with Dean Dotson. He holds
many valid suggestions for ways
to improve both the SJC and stu-
dent self-governance.”

“I see Dean Dotson as a strong
ally in communicating the SJC’s
ability to function independently
and j udiciously," he said.

Another source of contention
on the SJC has been this year’s
policy change that removed the
right to appeal ﬁrst strikes as-
signed by administrators to the
SJC.

“The inability for the SJC to
hear ﬁrst strikes presents a prob-
lem of legitimacy in the eyes of
studer1ts...Before this year, stu-
dents had the option to either sign
off on a ﬁrst strike through an ad-
ministrator or come to the SJC,”
Wilson said.

“I recognize the administrative
strike as a useful way to handle
clear-cut violations,” he allowed,
but went on to say that he will
“strive to reinstate a student’s
ability to present a case before a
body of elected peers.”

With the officers now in place,
elections for EC Representatives
and SJC Justices will be held
Monday, March 19.

IFC looking at SAE

pledge ship activities

Director of Public Safety Mike Young says the allegations facing SAE are
similar in seriousness to the charges currently facing FIJI and Kappa Sig

By Jacob Geiger
MANAG|NG EDITOR

An investigation into the
pledgeship activities of Sigma Al-
pha Epsilon has forced the frater-
nity to suspend pledgeship.

Director of Greek Life Jason
Rodocker said he received infor-
mation about pledgeship activities
“multiple times and from multiple
sources.” Last week he asked Di-
rector of Public Safety Michael
Young to begin an investigation
into SAE’s pledgeship. Young
completed that investigation on
Thursday afternoon and sent his
ﬁndings to Rodocker.

SAE is the ﬁfth fraternity to
be investigated this winter. Phi
Gamma Delta and Kappa Sigma
have both suspend their pledge-
ship activities as a result of these
investigations.

Rodocker said that the Inter-
fraternity Council would hear the
results of Young’s investigations
and consider SAE’s case tonight
during its regularly scheduled
meeting.

“SAE was extremely coop-
erative and very forthcoming,”

~'R'odocker said. ' “They were hon-

, .~,.

“SAE was extremely cooperative and very

making it an easier process. ’

forthcoming. They were honest and that is

est and that is making it an easier
process.”

Young said that he spoke with
several SAE pledges as well as
one of the fratemity’s pledge
trainers. He said he also reviewed
information that had been given
to Rodocker.

SAE president Jordan Wesley
declined to comment because the
case had not yet been heard by
the IFC. He said he hoped to be
able to speak more frankly once
the investigation and case were
complete.

Sophomore member Beau Al-
len -said the chapter did not really
know what would happen and
said the fraternity was trying to
just carry on with its business.

While Young said he could not
detail the allegations against SAE,
he did say they were “similar in
seriousness” to the allegations

brought against FIJI and Kappa
Sigma. FIJI is currently waiting
to appear before the Student Af-
fairs Committee.

SAE, like FIJI, has been in
trouble recently with the IFC.
SAE received a strike from the
IFC in October for having mari-
juana in the fraternity house.
FIJI saw one strike expire in No-
vember but has another strike on
its record until May.

Rodocker said ‘SAE nationals
had not been informed of the in-
vestigation and said they would
not be contacted until after the
IFC has heard the case.

“Nationals are typically not
contacted by me until the truth is
resolved, but that can vary,” he
said.

Though Rodocker and the IFC
have been kept busy with several
serious investigations this winter,

he said none of the situations are
as bad as the allegations that Beta
Theta Pi faced when it was dis-
missed from campus during the
2003-2004 school year.

“The investigations this year
are not anything like what hap-
pened three to four years ago,”
Rodocker said. “They’re not as
bad as they were then, but these
actions are still inappropriate and
unnecessary.”

The IFC, Rodocker said, is
working to reveal as much in-
formation as it can. He said the
Greek governing body wants to
help other chapters understand
what types of behavior are not
acceptable while still trying to
maintain some sort of privacy for
each chapter.

Rodocker and Young both ac-
knowledged that fraternity haz-
ing at other universities is often
more serious than the problems
at W&L, but both pointed think
W&L should continue holding it-
self to a higher standard.

“It is the norm that these things
happen here, and that needs to
change,” Rodocker said. “Many
freshman have told me they think
that sort of thing is OK, and it’s
not.”

W&L touts
new hires

New law dean will leave Richmond
University to take the reigns at W&L

By Dane Davis
sr/arr wamaa

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has announced the hiring of
Rodney A. Smolla and Richard
A. Peterson to Dean of the Law
School and Chief Technology
Ofﬁcer, respectively.

Smolla, currently the Dean
of the University of Richmond’s
T.C. Williams School of Law,
has been hired after an exten-
sive search beginning late in the
summer of 2006. The search
began after the departure of pre-
vious dean David Partlett, who
left to become dean of the law
school at Emory University.

From Partlett’s departure
last summer until February, the
university conducted a search
for an individual possessing the

“[Smolla] is one of

the country ’s fore-

most scholars of the
First Amendment
and a truly outstand-

~ ing teacher ”

BRIAN MURCHINSON,
Acting-«Dean of the
law school

talent and dedication to lead the
W&L’s esteemed law school.
Chaired by President Rus-
cio, a twelve person committee
was formed to review all of the
applicants for the position.
Smolla will take over from
acting-dean Brian Murchison,
who also served last year as
chairman of the school’s presi-
dential search committee.
Professor Murchison is “very
excited about the appointment
of Smolla and what it means for
the future of the law school. He
is one of the country’s foremost
scholars of the First Amend-
ment and a truly outstanding
teacher. He will reinforce the
traditions of excellence at the

Law School and provide dy-
namic leadership for our strate-
gic plan and other ventures.”
Smolla comes with a his-
tory of legal achievement and
is highly respected by his peers.
He displays a strong knowledge
of the legal system, particularly
concerning the First Amend-
ment. In addition to writing nu-
merous legal treatises, Smolla

‘won critical acclaim for his

works such as “Free Speech in
an Open Society” and “Suing
the Press: Libel, the Media, and
Power.”

A.E. Dick Howard, White
Burkett Miller Professor of Law
and Public Affairs at the Univer-
sity of Virginia, said, “Rod has
a national reputation as scholar,
teacher, advocate, and civic and
professional leader. I can think
of no one in the American acad-
emy who has made a greater
imprint on our understanding of
the First Amendment.”

Smolla is not the only addi-
tion to the university as it heads
towards the 2007 school year.

Richard A. Peterson served
as Director of Academic and
Research Computing for Rice

.University before being chosen
‘ by Washington and Lee to serve

as the school’s Chief Technol-
ogy Officer. Peterson will be
the ﬁrst person to hold that po-
sition.

Prior to his tenure at Rice
University, Peterson was the
Director of Information Tech-
nology for the College of Arts
and Sciences at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
from 1999-2005.

As Chief Technology Oﬁ‘1-
cer, Peterson will be responsible
for leadership, planning, and ef-
fective delivery of computing
services throughout campus, for
advancing the W&L’s mission
through the use of technology
and for coordination with cer-
tain academic departments.

Peterson and his staff of 35
will immediately have their
hands full as they convert
W&L’s computers to the new
Windows Vista software.

THE RING-TUM PHI 0 3

Bysacha Raab
STAFF WRITER

At a school as challenging as
Washington and Lee, students of-
ten hear that everyone is a leader.

However, despite constant re-
minders of this fact, how many
students actually take advantage
of the opportunities provided
them to develop their leadership
skills? There is little doubt that
everyone at W&L knows William
“Burr” Datz, the director of lead-
ership development.

He has dedicated the past six
years to the growing leadership
program at W & L. He conducts
leadership seminars with speciﬁc
groups, such as dorm counselors,
fraternities, sororities and sports
teams. Additionally, he leads
weekly leadership seminars open
to anyone who is interested in dis-
covering and building their lead-
ership potential.

Datz strongly advocates
hands-on, experiential learning.
He describes, “If I lecture a group
on leadership, the students will
obtain about 10-20 percent of
the information I give them. If I
demonstrate skills to the members
of a group, they will come away
with about 40-50 percent of what
I show. However, if the group
experiences the leadership exer-
cises, it will retain 75-80 percent
of the information.”

His weekly seminars typically
begin with the group considering
a reﬂective question and talking
about various answers. Datz then
provides a reality check, which
either conﬁrms or corrects the
group’s ideas. He usually spends
the ﬁrst semester of the school
year developing “tangible” bases
of leadership, referring to the con-
crete physical and mental aspects
of leadership. During the second
half of the year, Datz focuses
on the “intangible” elements of

Looking for leadership

Leadership guru Burr Datz keeps exploring new
ways to study leadership and teach W&L students

“If you can tell a story, whether it’s true or not,

and get people to believe it and invest them-

selves in it, then you can build trust. ”

BURR DA12, Director of Leadership Development
 

students how to be leaders while
they observe. Then, he will al-
low the students to take part in
the activities while he continues
to demonstrate them. Eventu-
ally, the students will be perform-
ing the majority of the leadership
activities while Datz continues to

provide some help. The students I

are eventually able to utilize their
leadership skills without any as-
sistance.

~ Datz believes, “If you can tell
a story, whether it’s true or not,
and get people to believe it and
invest themselves in it, then you
can build trust.”

Therinain steps of leadership,
according to Datz, are to assess
the situation, make a plan, make
the ﬁnal preparations for the plan,
lead the plan, and ﬁnally evaluate
it. Datz describes life as a dance
floor and everyone is dancing. In
the ﬁnal step of evaluating the
plan, his goal is to “pull students,

as leaders, to the balcony to ob-
serve these dance systems.”

The greatest beneﬁt to students
of these leadership seminars is the
ability to get to know oneself and
one’s strengths and weaknesses.
Seminars with groups such as
Greek chapters or sports teams
provide the best kind of peer pres-
sure. Students are able to develop
their faith and trust in each other.
Datz explains the primary steps
of leadership and group work as
knowing “Where we are going,
what we are doing, how we know
when we get there, and how we
will do this together.”

While the weekly seminars
are not usually packed full of stu-
dents, Datz’s work with groups
on campus has been widely ap-
preciated and the feedback very
positive.

At a school full of leaders,
Datz keeps working to show stu-
dents the way.

Protecting
counselors

I heard from one of the peer
counselors today that Mike

‘ Young was quoted as saying that

the Peer Counseling program was
one source of information he used
to get information about fraternity
hazing. This is incorrect inforrna—
ition, as peer counselors take a
pledge of conﬁdentiality and are
;not allowed to disclose any in—
formation reported to them about
‘fraternity hazing. Student trust in
conﬁdentiality of peer counseling
contacts is very important to the
program.

‘ Just to clarify, the peer coun-
;selors do not report any infor-
mation presented to them about
hazing. They may discuss with
‘pledges the options available to
them, including the conﬁdential
-hazing line, but they do not make

any report. In addition, they do

not report any rule violations, in-

cluding honor violations. They
do not report any substance use.
They do not report any crimes
reported to them. The only cir-
cumstances where they might
break conﬁdentiality is if a stu-
dent coming to them presents a
real possibility of harm to self or
others, as in suicidal or homicidal
ideas. In that case, the PC would
consult with the University Coun-
selor on call, and the University
Counselor would make a clinical
decision about what action was
needed to protect the student or
others from harm.

Thank you very much for your
help,

Kirk Luder

The EC may mean well
with this new proposal, but al-

The SFHB was organized

cases?

Investigations of sexual as-

The beastly side of beauty and power

-Nationals for Delta Zeta swoop in and force out even the president in an eﬂort to increase recruitment at DePauw

§By Grace Andrews
COLUMNIST

Today’s topic is one of my fa-
vorites: beauty.

The Delta Zetas of DePauw
have learned a lesson about
‘beauty that many wish were not
-true. DePauw’s chapter recently
became victim to what they claim
is image discrimination.

The national chapter of Delta
:Zeta, in an attempt to improve
“commitment to recruit for the
chapter,” decided to revamp the
chapter at DePauw and increase

recruitment.

On DePauw’s campus, the la-
dies of Delta Zeta were known
more for being scholarly than
sexy. Their chapter consisted of
women from diverse backgrounds
and appearances. In fact, Delta
Zeta chapters all across the coun-
try are known for being extremely
diverse and open.

However, when the national
chapter arrived at DePauw’s cam-
pus, they proceeded to ask 23 of
the 35 members, who were black,
Asian, overweight, or “unattract-
ive,” to leave the organization.

According to ABC News, “the
sorority kept sisters who were
popular with fraternities.”

ABC News also said the na-
tional chapter cited “a steady de-
cline in membership in the Delta
Chapter over several years” and
said “the viability of the chapter
was in question.”

Those were the reasons they
gave for asking the 23 women
to leave. The national chapter
claims that appearance had noth-
ing to do with it.

Since the reasons why those
23 were asked to leave was never

speciﬁed, their assumptions have
yet to be proveri incorrect;

The situation at DePauw raises
questions that have long plagued
the sorority scene. Although so-
rorities are based upon sisterhood,
character, and service, physical
attributes could inﬂuence some
sororities during their selection
process.

As progressive as we would
like to think we are, it would be
ridiculous to say that our society
does not value looks.

If you look in magazines and
movies, the push to be thin and

attractive is everywhere. It is be-

"cause of the importance placed

on physical beauty that a national
Greek letter organization would
even consider thinking that “at-
tractive” members could attract
more women to the chapter. How-
ever, I am not making excuses for
the Delta Zeta national chapter.

They had no right whatsoever
to evict any of the Delta Zeta
women at DePauw without legiti-
mate reasons.

I think that this situation has
opened up dialogue concem—
ing shallowness within not only

college practices, but society as .

a whole. Frankly, I believe it is
about time.

So what if the ladies who were
in Delta Zeta were not America’s
Next Top Model or had the hottest
bodies? How many people even
truly look like that?

Perfection should never be our
aim or even promoted.

The outrage that has ensued
over the DePauw controversy
makes me hopeful for the future.
It shows that our country is mak-
ing leaps and bounds into the right
direction.

Britney’s big breakdown

Could somebody please remind us why America should care about Britney?

By Cody Beauchamp
c 0 L U M N I s T
An Open Letter to Britney
Spears:
Hey Brit!

We just wanted to let you know
that even though everyone in the
world is giving you a hard time,
we as a society are here for you.
We’re not really sure why we still
care about your antics, but let’s
face it -- we’re a slave for you.

Wow. So, where to start? First
off, we love the new ‘do. It’s very
Sinead O’Conner. Way to get
your career back on track ~ re-
shaping your image so that it re-
minds us of that so-so singer who
went batty on SNL and tore up a
picture of the Pope. Hey, maybe
you should do that? Given how
our ﬁrst memory of you was the
slutty Catholic schoolgirl thing,
it’d be like you came full circle.
(Besides, this Pope isn’t as cuddly
as the last one, so you might get
cut a little more slack.)

We’ll go talk to Lorne Mi-
chaels about letting you guest
host. Wait! How do you feel
about Madonna as musical guest?
Get back to us on that.

Of course, it’d also be pretty
awesome if we could get Justin.
You two used to be such a cute
couple. And now that you’ve got
the same hair-style, a mash-up of
“Toxic” and “My Love” would
only be that much better! Could

It ’d be pretty awesome if we could get Justin...

And now that you ’ve got the same hair-style, a

mash-up of “Toxic ” and “My Love ” would only

be that much better!

someone call Timbaland?

Speaking of music, can we
expect anything out of you soon?
We know that it must be hard to
ﬁnd the time to write music, what
with the family you’ve got now.
All that money that you’re spend-
ing on professional nannies has to
come from somewhere though!

And now that you don’t have
K-Fed’s rap career to keep the Red
Bull on the table, you really are in
a ﬁx, huh? Maybe you should see
if Paris can spot you some?

Although, if you wanted, I bet
that some of the frats have mixers
coming up that you could play.
Used to be Cool? Rock Stars and
Rehabbers? The Letter D (in your
case “disaster”)?

Of course, that’s assuming that
we still have frats in a few days.
Someone in the administration
might overhear “that was a rock-
ing party” and misinterpret it to
mean pledges are getting stoned
Biblical style. There’s also the
strong possibility that F IJI’s
super-extra-serious-we-really-
mean-it-this—time probation will
be violated and the administration

will just decide to do away com-
pletely with one of W&L’s most
distinguishing characteristics—a
strong Greek community.

Not that we actually believe
the administration to be like that,
it’s just that we have no way of
knowing, since the IFC and the
SAC (when and how did they get
involved anyway?) don’t feel the
need to be transparent or open
about their actions.

But, don’t worry Brit. Even
if we don’t have frats we’ll still
have Fancy Dress.‘ It really is
mind-boggling.

Anyway, the point is we want
to see you make a comeback.
You’ve had a rough time, you
know? It’s not like you were in-
credibly lucky and were given a
golden pass to fame by some very
savvy pop producer. It’s not like
you’ve completely blown oppor-
tunities millions of aspiring artists
would have killed to have had to be
a millionaire entertainer. You’ve
had to “work” hard. You’ve had
to, like, sing for hours, and only
for a few million. You’ve had the
paparazzi hound you when you’re

making an idiot of yourself with
Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan
at some club. You’re just not that
innocent.

Don’t worry about losing our
attention though. See, we as a
culture love to shower seemingly
pointless media attention on peo-
ple who make no measurable con-
tributions to culture, society, even
pop culture. I mean, never mind
that there are hundreds of better
entertainers out there, you went
nuts and got a new tattoo—let’s
cover that!

Never mind that there are so
many truly talented new bands,
musicians, actors, writers and
singers being discovered every
day—you were seen lip—locking
with some C-list actor outside the
auditions for VH1 ’s “The Surreal
Life 39.” Stop the presses!

So keep your chin up Brit-
ney! You’ll get out of rehab in a
few weeks, and then you can get
back to that whole making music
thing that made you rich in the
ﬁrst place. We’ll patiently wait
for you, but we’re going to point-
lessly shower Nicole Richie with
attention until you get back, al-
right? Cool.

PS — If you really wanted to
grab national attention, you could
overdose a la Anna Nicole. On
second though, don’t do that—the
media coverage would probably
just get swallowed up by word
that Ashley Olsen is-ohm-
ygawd!—not eating.

Faculty Alums
reflect on PD

experiences

By Sarah Kientz
STAFF WRITER

As this year marked the 100"‘
anniversary of Fancy Dress, some
of our faculty alumni commented
on their own Fancy Dress expe-
riences and how the dance has
changed through the years.

History professor Holt Mer-
chant. class of 1961, said Fancy
Dress was much ditlierent when
he was a student at W&L.

Merchant said there were four
major dances throughout the year,
and what set Fancy Dress apart
was that students wore costumes
corresponding with the theme.

“There was a committee that
ran each [dance] and there was a
prestige to belonging to the com-
mittee, so it was always run by
the Phi Dells and SAF.s.”° Mer-
chant said.

The theme of each dance al-
ways included a character or au-
thority ﬁgure, Merchant said, and
boys who headed the corrrmittee
were “always the ones who did it,
so they had the best costumes.”

Merchant said the ba.rrds that
played at Fancy Dress when he
was a student played “real music,
not what passes through music
now.” l\lerchant said bands like
The Temptations, The Four—Tops
and Duke Ellington have all
played at Fancy Dress. Now, Mer-
chant said, the bands featured at
FD are one reason he has stopped
attending the event.

“The last Fancy Dress I went
to was a heayy metal singer who
wore nothing but a diaper and
I said. Never again!" Merchant
said.

Merchant also added that he
stopped attending Fancy Dress
because of the behavior of stu-
dents. They may be dressed for-
mally. he said. but they do not
exhibit “fomral behavior."

“One thing that stopped me
from going was my drunken stu-
dents telling me what they really
thought of me when I didn’t really
want to know,” Merchant said.

Though Merchant said his
days of attending Fancy Dress are
over. there was also a time when
many students did not attend the
event either.

“In the 70s [the popularity of
Fancy Dress] died out for a while.
Students were rebelling against
almost everything the school had
done before —~ the dress code. the
honor system,” Merchant said.
“Anything that looked that formal
students wouldnt have anything
to do witlr."

Jim Farrar. assistant to presi-
dent Ruscio, graduated from
W&I. in 1974. Farrar said Fancy
Dress did not really exist for a few
years in the 70s. Instead, there
were a few years where students
attended concerts.

“That was right in the middle
of student unrest days. It was a
period of pushing the envelope
and testing tradition," Farrar said.
“People were less inclined to wear

_ costumes and formal attire than

to do their own thing. They were
good concerts, and it was a lot of
fun, but it was just different.”

Farrar said that Fancy Dress
reverted to its original format his
senior year.

“In retrospect it was nice to
have a break and come back to
it,” Farrar said. “It’s always good
to experiment, and that’s what the
70s were all about. It was appro-
priate for the times.”

Now, Farrar believes FD is
one of W&L’s “better institutional
traditions.”

“It’s fun, and it allows students
to exercise creativity, but it comes
with the expectation that fun is
conducted in an appropriate man-
ner,” Farrar said. “It’s important
this year to pause and observe
the tradition that will continue in
a positive manner for a long time
to come.”

Journalism professor Brian
Richardson also attended Fancy
Dress before graduating in 1973.
The controversy at Kent State oc-
curred the spring of his freshman
year, and consequently “campus-
es were in upheaval all over the
country, including this one.”

“Fraternity membership was
on the decline, and there was a
counterculture atmosphere by a
signiﬁcant number of people,”
Richardson said. “There just was
not enough interest in a Fancy
Dress.”

Though there was no formal
event, Richardson said the con-
certs were still “wildly popular.”
In 1972, the 1950s revival group
Sha-na-na came to W&L. Rich-
ardson said that everyone dressed
like 1950s greasers for the con-
cert, which was known that year
as “Greasy Dress.”

“Everybody went and had
a great time," Richardson said.
“People didn’t spend weeks he-
forehand getting a date and plan-
ning a big dinner. It was not near-
ly as big ofa deal as FD is now, it
was more like a big concert.”

Richardson attributes the pop-
ularity of Fancy Dress to its tim-
ing at the end of winter.

“It’s almost the end of winter,
we've survived February. spring
is in the air and the end of win-
ter term is in sight, everyone just

wants to kick up their heels a lit- ,

tle bit,” Richardson said. “I don't
think it would have continued as
robustly as it has if it wasn’t to
celebrate the end of winter. Plus
this is a place that just breathes
tradition.”

President Ken Ruscio also
spoke of the presence of tradition
at Fancy Dress.

Though he admits the event
has changed, “what has not
changed is the spirit, a time for
friendship, and a time for the
community-—faculty, staff, stu-
dents, and alunmi—to come to-
gether as one,” Ruscio said. “It
creates memories that live well
past graduation and remains one
of those distinctive features of the
University that link our past with
the present and the future."

A century
of tradition

Continued from cover

of a quarter million budget. she
said. “Originally. we thought
maybe we would have a larger
budget. ()ur budget is larger than
rrorrrral year. but it is nothing close
to that."

De Grazia also said that the ma-
jority of the budget went towards
entertainment. The Pat Patrick
Band is originally from Nashville,
Tenn, and has played at numer-
ous venues including the White
House. The band played music of
all genres. including pop, soul and
rock and roll.

“Since we expect[ed] more
alunrni this year, we really wanted
to appeal to all age groups," De
Grazia said.

The comnrittee, according to
Tsiknakis, has been meeting all
year. In the fall. students can ﬁll
out applications to be a part of a
sub-corrrnrittee. If they are cho-

sen, they are required to dedicate
30 hours of their time to their du-
ties.

“The biggest challenge was
at the very beginning of our
process when we were select-
ing the eommittee members,"
Tsiknakis said. “We received
over 100 applications this year,
and we generally take less than
50 members. We would like to
take everyone, but that obviously
can’t happen.”

De Grazia said she was ex-
tremely proud of the eﬂ“orts of
every committee member.

At the end of the night, guests
exited, exhausted from two-step-
ping to tunes like ‘Sweet Home
Alabama.’

Couples then enjoyed a free
breakfast of eggs and watﬂes in
Evans Dining Hall alter a night
they will not forget.

Try a combo.

Some did it right, but some did
it way wrong. There were some
dresses with a lovely balance of
the two extreme colors, using
them to complement each other.
Then, there were those that

had the effect of a heinous tutu
from second—grade ballet recital.
Balance is everything with black
and white (but that doesn’t mean
equal use ofthe two, like in this
gingham tablecloth dress).

Kat Greene keeps her eye out for the biggest trends at the ball.

In short order.

Some like it hot. but “black and white
ball" doesn't imply dressing like you
were about to attend a football game.
The completely inappropriate sundress
and flip—flop outfit isjust lazy. But others
pulled off the short look with a sleek.
chic cut and sky-high heels.

When in Rome...

The Roman goddess dress was a
lovely way to embrace the black and
white theme. The lightweight material
was veryflattering, which is why it
was such a popular choice. One dress
had a particularly nice deep neckline,
which accents anyone's ﬁgure well.

Prints and
princesses.

Prints are always hit—or-miss.
Since black and white ﬂorals
are showing this spring, it was
an easy choice for some. Not to
rule out animal prints, either.
Ordinarily, they would be a
mistake, but several dresses
pulled it off with class.

  

School uniform.

The W&Ltie and cumberbund combo was
so outrageous it was almost cute. We get
it—-it's a black and white ball at W&L...so
you're wearing black and white and W&L.
Adorable. At least you didn't wear alight
blue shirt with a white collar and a dark blue
Vineyard Vines patterned tie. That means
you, Johnson Brownlow.

Women’s Lacrosse

The Washington and Lee wom-
en’s lacrosse team fell to eighth-
ranked Franklin and Marshall
11-9 on Saturday afternoon.
Franklin & Marshall jumped
out to an early 2-0 lead, but the
Generals responded with ﬁve

 

unanswered goals to build a 5-2
lead with 10:34 to play in the
ﬁrst half. Going into the half,
the Generals were up 6-5. As the
second half opened, senior mid-
ﬁelder Mallory Lobisser found
the back of the net to give the
Generals a two-goal lead. How-
ever, F&M scored four-straight
goals to assume a 9-7 lead. A
score by sophomore midﬁelder
Colleen Evans closed F&M’s
edge to one goal, but F&M put
the game away with two goals
late in the half. The Generals
were led by Evans, who scored
three goals, and sophomore
attacker Kelsi Robinson’s one
goal and two assists. Evans is
leading the Generals in goals so
far this season, while Robinson
is the team’s leading scorer. Se-
nior midﬁelder Kelly Evans and
junior midﬁelder Megan Slosson
each added one goal and one as-
sist. Junior Sarah Tilbor guarded
the net for the entire game for the
Generals, registering a season-
high 13 saves. The Generals im-
proved their record on the season
to 4-1. The Generals return to the
ﬁeld on Wednesday when they
host ODAC-foe Bridgewater at
4:00 p.m.

Baseball ,

The Washington and Lee base-

ball team extended its winning

streak to nine straight games

with a 6-3 road victory over

Mary Washington on Sunday

afternoon. The Generals im-

proved their record to 11-3 on

the season. In the Mary Wash-

ington game, the Generals took

a 2-0 lead into the top of the ﬁfth

inning, but Mary Washington

tacked on two runs to tie the

game going into the sixth inning.

The Generals scored a pair of
runs in the top of the eighth in-

ning to take a 4-2 lead and held
on to the lead despite another
Mary Washington score in the

bottom of the eighth inning. The

Generals added two more runs

in the top of the ninth inning to

end the game with a 6-3 victory.

The Generals were paced by
senior designated hitter Richard
Garland, who went 2-for-3 and
senior shortstop Ray Sweeney’s
2-for-4 performance. Senior Jor-
dan Wesley was 1-for-1 with two
RBI, while junior leftﬁelder Tim
Livingston went 2-for-4 with
an RBI and freshman catcher
Will Lewis when 1-for-3 with
an RBI. Freshman right-hander
Chuck Davidson tossed the ﬁrst
ﬁve innings of play, allowing
just three hits and two unearned
runs. Junior lefthander Jeff
Pharis relieved him for two and
two-thirds innings and picked
up his ﬁrst win of the season.

Freshman Jim Plantholt pitched
the ﬁnal one and a third innings
to notch his fourth save of the
year.The Generals return to the
ﬁeld on Friday when they host
Villa Julie, and they will also
host Virginia Wesleyan in a
doubleheader on Saturday.

against Washington Col-
lege in the last half of the
third quarter when they al-
lowed three goals in five
minutes.

The Generals rallied,
scoring once more in the
third and twice in the
fourth, but it was too little,
too late. Ryan, who sniped
the final goal in that game,
said the loss isn’t reflective

of the team’s abilities.

He said that the players
have improved drastically
under the guidance of their
coach, Gene McCabe.

This is the team’s first
season under McCabe, but
Ryan said that he expects
the team to do very well
when ODAC play starts.

The Generals got off to a
strong start with the ﬁrst doubles
team of juniors Tim-Ross and Nat
Estes defeating Denison’s Kevin
Newman and Randy Lofgren 8-2
to give W&L the first point of the
match.

However, Denison claimed the
remaining two doubles matches
to take a 2-1 lead going into the
singles matches. Denison’s James
Davis and Jordan Buehler defeat-
ed Jon Malooly and Jamie McCa-
rdell by a score of 8-3.

Stuart Sanford and Andrew,E,._l-
lison fell to Denison’s duo of
Hodgkiss-Lilly and Charlie Poe,‘
also by a score of 8-3.

The Generals won three of the
ﬁrst four singles matches to gain a
one point advantage in the match.

‘Estes defeated Jordan Buehler 6-

4, 6-4, in second singles, Malooly
defeated James Davis 7-5, 6-1, in
third singles, Stuart Sanford best-

als when he defeated Randy Lof-
gren 6-4, 7-5 in the ﬁrst singles
match. Denison’s Tom Hodgkiss-

On Wednesday the Gener-
als hosted Hampden-Sydney and
bested the Tigers 8-1. Playing No.
2 singles, Nat Estes dropped only
one game en route to his victories
over Chris Picarde of Randolph-
Macon and Richie Holzaphel of
Hampden-Sydney.

On Sunday, the Generals best-
ed Washington College, who was
ranked 10“‘ in the region, 7-2. Ja-

and Alex Brook defeated Midial
Sentala and Derek Wise 8-1 in

No. 3 doubles to give the Gener-
als a 2-1 advantage heading into
the singles competition.

The Generals took ﬁve of the
six singles matches to seal the
team victory.

Halfway through the ﬁrst set in
the No. 2 singles match between
W&L’s Estes and Washington
College’s Rafael Roldan, Roldan
questionably called Estes’ serve
out. Estes protested vehemently
but Roldan refused to change his
mind. After a brief standoff, play
resumed and Estes won the ﬁrst
set 6-3 and proceeded to sweep
the second set 6-0.

Other victorious Generals in-

cluded Malooly, who defeated
Brian Danver 6-0, 6-1, McCa-
rdell, who bested Todd Green 7-

by Arturo Solis who defeated
Ross 6-4, 6-2, in No. 1 singles and
paired with Roldan to defeat Ross
and Estes 8-4 in No. 1 doubles.

The Generals return to com-
petition this Tuesday as they

lege to take on the Marlins, who
were picked to ﬁnish third in the
ODAC preseason poll.

It was business as usual
for the Washington and Lee
women’s tennis team as they
took on two opponents Sat-
urday afternoon. ‘

A true testament to the
team’s incredible depth, the
Generals were able to take
on two non-conference op-
ponents, using two different
lineups. The Generals started
the day with a commanding
8-1 victory over Washing-
ton College. Later in the af-
ternoon, the team defeated
Denison College, a team that
has given W&L problems in
the past, in ﬁne form, 8-1.

Against Denison, who is
ranked 16th in the nation,
sophomore Katie Tabb was
victorious at ﬁrst singles, 6-
4, 6-3, while junior Ginny
Woitham was pushed to a
tie-breaker in order to win

It’s been a sister act for
the Washington and Lee
women’s lacrosse team this
season.

Senior captain Kelly Ev-
ans has been joined on the
ﬁeld by her younger sister,
sophomore Colleen, who
transferred to W&L from
Bucknell University.

Originally from Lexing-
ton, the sisters have com-
bined for 18 goals and 11 as-
sists in the team’s ﬁve games.
Colleen is second in the team
in scoring, and Kelly is third.
Colleen is leading the team

in goals scored, while Kelly _

is leading the team in shot
percentage.

The two bring a new dy-
namic to the team, since they
have grown up playing to-

gether.

Colleen said, “Playing
with the sis has been great.
It’s deﬁnitely a throwback to
high school. .

“But both Kelly and I
have developed and changed
as players a lot since high
school - so its fun to see what
we are working with now and
if we can still connect the
way we did four years ago.”

Colleen, who got a taste
of Division I lacrosse at
Bucknell last year, is happy
to be back playing in her
hometown:

“Once I got [to Bucknell]
I realized that I liked [it],
but didn’t love it. Playing
lacrosse year round was a
commitment I didn’t want to
make. I think I was compar-
ing everything there to W&L,
and realized that W&L is
unique.

“Colleen Evans has been a tremendous

addition to the team. She can play the

wholeﬁel . ”

KELSI ROBINSON, sophomore attacker
 

“Nowhere else is like it.
Then I knew that this was
actually where I wanted to
be, it just took me leaving to
realize it.”

In Saturday’s 11-9 loss to
eighth-ranked Franklin and
Marshall, Colleen led the
Generals with three goals,
while Kelly chipped in one
goal and two assists.

The sisters have been
a force for the Generals
throughout the entire season.

The Generals have got-
ten off to a great 4-1 start,
including a victory over 13th

ranked St. Mary ’s for the ﬁrst
time in program history.

Also making big contri-
butions for the Generals has
been sophomore Kelsi Rob-
inson, who is leading the
Generals in scoring with 10
goals and 6 assists.

Sophomore Ali Hillyard
and junior Sarah Tilbor have
been splitting time in goal,
only allowing 32 goals over
5 games.

While the Evans sisters
may be tearing up the ﬁeld,
they also are having a lot of
fun playing together.

Colleen said, “Being on a

team with her again has been
the usual mayhem it always
was. She gives me a hard
time, and she has gotten the
whole team to call me Bean,
her dreadful nickname for
me.”
Colleen is not the only
one happy to be playing for
the Generals this season, as
her teammates have really
appreciated her additions to
the team.

Sophomore Kelsi Robin-
son said, “Colleen Evans has
been a tremendous addition
to the team.

“She can play the whole
ﬁeld--scoring, assisting, and
very strong on defense as
well”

The Generals return to
action on Wednesday when
they host ODAC-foe Bridge-
water College at 4 p.m.

W&L baseball team 0/7 to a strong start and a nine—game win
streak which has catapulted them into ﬁrst place in the ODAC

By Russ Weems
STAFF WRITER

Generals baseball extended
its winning streak to nine games
with six wins this week. Washing-
ton and Lee played Mount Aloy-
sius twice, Guilford once and
Eastern Mennonite twice. But the
weekend was capped off when
the team beat Mary Washington
in Fredericksburg Sunday.

“So far we’ve been play-
ing good baseball, and we’ve
been swinging the bats well. We
are making the most of the rou-
tine plays, and we’ve had strong
pitching,” said freshman Charles
Davidson.

The Generals opened the week
with a sweep of Mount Aloysius.
In the ﬁrst game, the Mounties
jumped out to a 5-0 lead. W&L
was losing 6-3 going into the
ﬁfth when they scored an impres-
sive eleven runs. The inning was
capped off by a three-run shot by
senior Ray Sweeney. The Gener-
als added two more scores leaving

the ﬁnal 15-7. Leading the bats for
the Generals was sophomore Ter-
rence McKelvey, who went two
for three with a double, W&L also
dominated the second game against
the Mounties, giving the Generals

an 8-0 victory. McKelvey went
two for three again with a double
and two RBI. Senior DH Richard
Garland went three for three, and
Sweeney went two for four. Right
hander Davidson got his ﬁrst ca-
reer win in a six inning shutout ef-
fort allowing only two hits.

The winning streak extended
to six with a 4-1 over Guilford.
The game opened up quickly for

the Generals with two solos shots
from McKelvey and David Mill-
er.

In the fourth, W&L added their

‘ﬁnal two runs aided by a triple by

Sweeney. The Quakers scored a
run in the eighth, but it was too
little too late. The Generals came
out on top, 4-1. Marcott recorded
another win with six innings of
scoreless baseball. Garland went
three for four, and Sweeney went
two for three. Overall, the Gen-
erals had a good showing with
strong pitching and active bats.
In their ﬁnal games of the
week, W&L swept Eastern Men-
nonite to push the streak to eight
games. The Generals dominated,
winning one by eight and one
by nine. In the ﬁrst game, W&L
scored nine runs in the ﬁrst three
innings and never looked back.
The ﬁnal scored ended up 11-3.

Pittman honored

All-American soccer player one of 5 8 fall athletes awarded NCAA

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING canon

After receiving plenty of rec-
ognition last fall for his perfor-
mance on the soccer ﬁeld during
the past four years, senior de-
fender Scot Pittman is now being
honored for his work on and off
the ﬁeld.

Pittman was one of 58 NCAA
fall athletes honored with a
post-graduate scholarship worth
$7,500 for part-time or full-time
graduate work.

The NCAA honors a different
set of athletes each season.

Pittman is the seventh Wash-
ington and Lee athlete in ﬁve
years to be honored.

Pittman said his coach, Rolf
Piranian, told him about the
scholarship.

Pittman had to submit recom-
mendations from his coach and a
teacher, forms explaining his vol-
unteer work and campus leader-
ship roles and a short essay about
his post-graduation plans.

As a student, Pittman has been
on the honor roll three times and
the Dean’s List four times.

He is a member of Omicron

Delta Kappa, and he is a peer
counselor. ’

Pittman will graduate from
W&L with a degree in biology,
but he hopes to eventually attend
law school.

The two subjects may seem
unrelated, but Pittman says there
is a connection.

“I was really interested in biol-
ogy coming out of high school,”
he said. “I want to continue the
biology background in law as a
patent lawyer for a pharmaceuti-
cal or genetics company.”

Because the soccer season
kept Pittman from preparing for
the LSAT tests last fall, Pittman
is taking a year off to study for
the tests and then apply to law
schools. During this fall, he
hopes to work as the assistant
soccer coach for his high school.

“There are LSAT prep classes
in Charlotte, where I’m from,”
Pittman said, “so I’ll study and
take the classes at night and then
coach during the day.”

Once the soccer season ends
and his law school applications
are submitted, Pittman said he is
not sure what he’ll do.

He does hope to travel abroad

, Postgraduate Scholarship for academic and athletic excellence

either this summer or next.

On the ﬁeld this fall, Pittman
became the ﬁfth Generals’ soc-
cer player to earn All-American
honors when he was named to
the third team. He was also a ﬁrst
team all-ODAC selection.

With Pittman leading the de-
fense from his central defender
spot, this year’s team started 8-0.

That eight game winning
streak was the program’s best
start in history, and the team
ended up ﬁnishing 12-3-2 with a
6-2-1 record in conference play.
The defense notched 10 shutouts
and allowed only nine goals in 17
games.

Pittman started every game
this year. During his career, he
appeared in 64 games, starting 55
of them. ,

He said this year’s 8-0 start and
the team’s trip to the ODAC ﬁnals
when he was a freshman stand out
as memorable moments.

“Freshman year at the ODAC
ﬁnals in Virginia Wesleyan was
great because nobody expected us
to get that far,” Pittman said.

“And it was a lot of fun this
year when we set the record this
year for best start.”

on his way to a W.

The second game was much of
the same. The Generals scored 14
runs in the ﬁrst four innings. This
deﬁcit was too large for EMU to
overcome, and the ﬁnal score was
17-4. Second baseman Miller had
a big performance; he went four
for seven with two doubles and
four RBI. Junior James Mad-
den also had a multi-hit day with
a double and two RBI‘s.
John Parker pitched nearly seven
innings and recorded six strike-
outs in his win.

Garland and Sweeney con-
tinuted their successes Sunday
against Mary Washington, each
getting two hits. Davidson did
well in his ﬁrst start, but fresh-
man righthander Jim Plantholt
walked away with the save, the
fourth of his college career.

The Generals’ next three
games are at home this weekend,
including a double-header against
defending ODAC champs Virgin-

wo of Wasliington and I_cc's
fraternities have been placed
on critical probation following
hazing incidents.

George llunter. president of Kappa
Sigma, conﬁrmed that his organization
was placed on critical probation following
a meeting of the Student Affairs Commit-
tee (SAC) on Tuesday March 13.

Phi Gamma Delta president Andrew
Rothey conﬁrmed that i‘I.ll has received
twelve months probation as well.

Both cases were ﬁrst heard by the Inter-
fraternity Council. According to the Win-
ter edition of “W&L Greek Life News."
the IFC determined that Kappa Sigma had
“asked their new members to stand outside
in cold weather for approximately an hour
on two occasions" and that FIJI had asked
“new members to consume a concoction
of condiments.” As a result of these inci-
dents, the IFC suspended both chapters:
new member education.

The IFC thcnjtrdged the violations seri-
ous enough to warrant referring the case to
SAC, as the Student Handbook mandates.

SAC is an organization of students and
faculty chaired by Dawn Watkins, Dean of

Students. It primarily serves as a forum for
campus leaders to discuss and debate is-

,sues relating to student life, but it also has

an atljudieatirc role.

According to the Student Handbook.
SAC has oversight over student judicial
proceedings that would involve “the pos-
sible suspension or dismissal of a frater-
nity or sorority, or placing a fraternity or
sorority on critical probation."

The IFC recommended both fraterni-
ties be placed on critical orobation for one
year; critical probation carries no speciﬁc
penalty, and is instead customized to the
specific situation.

“You’re trying to tailor [the critical
probation to] whatever the concern is to
make the organization the best it can be,”
said Dean Watkins.

“Critical probation presents a myriad of
other complications that regular probation
doesn’t entail. In a hazing incident in par-
ticular, nationals are usually involved at
a high level,” said IFC President Andrew
Flannigan, a member of the SAC. “While
[the IFC] takes hazing seriously, [the na-
tionals] take it even more seriously.”

In this case, the IFC recommended the
critical probation mandate a shortened pe-
riod ofpledgeship for both fraternities next

year. According to the “W&L Greek Life

News,” the IFC wanted initiation to take
place in both fraternities before Washing-
ton Break and to be supervised by their na-
tiorrals. ."‘.\l‘.iitl~‘.‘llLlll>, their nationals would
be asked to hold mandatory meetings with
the membership this year to discuss new
member education and membership devel-
opment.

Kappa Sigma‘s Hunter confirmed that
next years pledgcship has been shortened,
but said its actual length has yet to be de-
cided.

Complicating matters is the strict con-
ﬁdentiality surrounding the particulars of
the case; all parties involved. including
witnesses. are informed that any breach of
conﬁdentiality is “a violation of both fed-
eral law and standards of the Washington
and Lee University community.”

This has been frustrating for some.
Commentators in the student media have
criticized the accuracy of recent hazing
reports, and the participation of faculty
through organizations like SAC has led
some to question the extent that student
self—governance is a reality at W&L.

“The decision ofhow to adjudicate fra-
temity matters should rest solely with the
student body,“ said Max Courtney, FIJl’s

how the process works:

- Information about a hazing violation reaches
Jason Rodocker, Director of Student Activities and
Greek Life, or the lnterfraternity Council (IFC).

- At the request of Rodocker or the IFC, Director
of Public Safety Mike Young conducts an
investigation of the allegations. Young typically
interviews pledges and pledge trainers.

- Once Young has completed his investigation, he
presents his finding at a meeting of the IFC.

-After hearing evidence from Young and the
fraternity, the IFC Judicial Board decides if the

fraternity is guilty.

- If the fraternity is found guilty, the IFC imposes
a punishment that can range from a warning to

dismissal of a fraternity.

- If the lFC’s suggested punishment would put the
fraternity on critical probation, then the case must
be heard by the Student Affairs Committee (SAC).

- The SAC meets with members of the fraternity
then ratifies or modifies the lFC’s suggested

punishment.

Senator John Warner Speaks Friday night about public service and the Shepherd Poverty Program

Warner’s help.

MANAGING EDITOR

Senator John Wamer’s visit to
campus on Friday is more than
just a homecoming for the Class
of 1949 alumnus. The visit also
marks another important mile-

. stone for Washington and Lee's

Shepherd Poverty Program.

Warner e Virginia’s senior
senator — has been working with
W&L professor Harlan Beckley
to seek federal funding that will
help the program expand to other
schools.‘

Since Beckley founded the
Shepherd Program at W&L. hun-
dreds of students have taken his
Poverty 101 class and more than

200 students have participated in,

eight-week summer internships.

Beckley wants to do more. The
Shepherd Program at W&L has
proposed a ﬁve year project to
establish similar programs at ten
other schools. -

The new program would com-
bine classroom work with the
summer internships pioneered
by W&L’s Shepherd students.
Currently, students from Berea
College, Morehouse College and
Spelman College are part of the
Shepherd Alliance participate in
the summer internships. but the
colleges have not yet been able
to add an academic component in
poverty.

“The alliance has existed since
the inception of the program. but
those schools don’t have an aca-
demic program that complements

ate and House members, and [Warner] is cer-

tainly one of those people. ”

schools L1i‘c' hopefully going to be
adding the academic program and
service side at the same time."
Some members of the pro-
posed consortium include Van-
derbilt. Georgetown. Middlebury.
the University ofRichmond, Mor-
gan State University and the Uni-
versity of Arkansas—Little Rock.
Morgan State and UA—Little Rock
are public universities, while the

other schools are private institu-
tions.

Beckley said the program
could not expand without help
from Warner and the federal
govermnent, There is currently
a proposal before both houses of
Congress that would authorize
the consortium to receive fed-
eral funding. Once that approval
passes, the consortium will ap-
proach the House and Senate Ap-

' propriations Committees to ask

for funding.

“[Wamer]’s provided indis-
pensable help,” Beckley said.
“You cannot pass legislation
without‘ key Senate and House
members, and he’s certainly one
ofthose people.”

On Friday Warner will speak
at a 4:00 pm. forum in the Com-
mons’ Stackhouse Theater before
delivering an address at 6:30 p.m.
in Lee Chapel.

The afternoon forum will also
feature remarks from Tom Shep-
herd — a founding contributor of
the program ~ and from several
students active in the program.

Senior Sam Wilmoth said he
is both excited and nervous about
speaking after Warner.

“There are the people who

persuade for a living,” Wilmoth
said. “lt’s both exciting and in-
timidating.”

Wilmoth did his Shepherd cap-
stone project on access to higher
education. Since he completed
the project while Beckley was
serving as W&L’s acting presi-
dent, Wilmoth worked with eco-
nomics professor Art Goldsmith.

Wilmoth also completed a
summer internship with the Wash-
ington, D.C. public defender’s of-
ﬁee.

“I was an investigative intern,
so I spent my time ﬁnding wit-
nesses, serving subpoenas, tak-
ing statements and photographing
crime scenes,” he said. “I loved
it.”

Kickoff dates set

Mock Con kickoﬁ’ will include concert by Gov ’t Mule

Bysacha Raab
STAFF WRITER

Fancy Dress isn’t the only im-
portant l00‘“ anniversary celebra-
tion this year. Washington and
Lee’s Mock Convention, which
happens to be the most accurate
mock convention in the country,
is planning its Spring Kickoff to
the 2008 Convention as a week-
end-long festival from May 25 to
26.

The Convention, entirely stu-
dent-run, began in 1908 when
William Jennings Bryan came
to visit Lexington. The students
held a realist convention for the
Democratic Party in his honor.

The 1908 convention correctly
predicted that Bryan would win
the Democratic nomination, but
the convention was also marred
by ﬁghts in the aisles.

Subsequent conventions have
been friendlier affairs.

The group holds a convention
each election year for the party
out of power, which this year is
the Democrats. The regional and
state chairs conduct a research
into the primary candidates to
determine which candidate each
state will support.

Washington and Lee’s Mock

“Since 2008 will be our 1 00 year anniversary, -

we want to set the tone for Spring Kickoff to

make it bigger and better ’

}

RICHARD FRIEDMAN, Mock Convention General Chair
 

Convention has a long history of
success, as it has only guessed
wrong once since I948. Wes Lit-
tle, the Political Chairman, claims
that “by next January, over 90%
of the W&L student body will be
involved with Mock Convention
and we will be the largest student
organization on campus.”

Including the steering and
executive committees, about 90
people are already working on
the convention. When the state
and regional chairs are added to
the mix, close to 200 people have
gotten involved.

The Spring Kickoff, which
takes place the spring before the
actual Convention, has typically
consisted of a day of prominent
speakers followed by a band’s
performance. This year, however,
will be different. Mock Conven-
tion General Chairman Richard
Friedman, said, “Since 2008 will

be our 100 year anniversary, we
want to set the tone for Spring
Kickoff to make it bigger and bet-
ter.”

Social Chair Jackie Neilson
said, “This year, we really want
to go above and beyond to cre-
ate a weekend—long event that
the campus will respond to and
want to attend. Spring Kickoff in
general is a big kick start to the
Mock Convention, so the events
themselves are designed to get
the student body excited about the
convention and, for me, the social
events that come along with it
over the next year.”

The Wednesday before the
major speakers are presented,
the College Republicans and the
Young Democrats hold a debate
concerning the issues in the pri-
mary and general elections.

Over the weekend there will
also be a Presidential Issues panel

Wilmoth eventually hopes to
study law, and he said the Shep-
herd program has changed the
way he’ll approach his future ca-
reer

“It’s altered the way I view a
job as meaningful,” he said. “I
couldn’t go work at a big ﬁrm and
make lots of money if I didn’t feel
like I was helping people.”

Wilmoth said he did not know
if he would go into public de-
fense.

“It is something I’ve consid-
ered,” he said. “We all have dif-
ferent gifts to give, and the key is
ﬁguring out how we can make a
contribution.”

Warner spokesman John Ul-
lyot said Warner has been work-
ing with the Shepherd program
since its early years.

3 He said Wamer’s time at W&L
helped shape his political actions
as well as his support for the
Shepherd Program.

“Senator Warner has always
supported the principle of giv-
ing back to the community and
the less fortunate,” Ullyot said.
“When he was a lawyer at Hogan
and Hartson they had a strong
pro-bono program that the Sena-
tor participated in.”

Warner ’s speech in Lee Chapel
will address how honor and civili-
ty play ﬁt with public service. Ul-
lyot said Warner saw strong honor

“The strong background of
honor and propriety that was
formed at W&L has served [War-
ner] well in the Senate,” Ullyot
said.

“Senator Warner has said that
W&L and the honor system are a
bedrock in his background.”

Though the Shepherd Con-
sortium is still waiting for fund-
ing from the federal government,
Beckley said the program keeps
expanding.

“We’ve already grown,” Beck-
ley said. “Programs are begin-
ning at John Carroll University in
Cleveland and at Rice University.
Barylor and Furrnan are also con-
sidering programs similar to the
consortium, but that depends on
the level of funding they have
available.” '

Wilmoth said he wants to see
the program keep expanding.

love to see spread across the
country,” he said. “We need to
solve the problems of poverty
and move it to the forefront of
national discussion.”

Jarding, Ike Allen, and Larry
Sabato.

Sabato, a UVa politics pro-
fessor, is well known for his
extremely accurate election pre-
dictions. He often appears on
the major cable networks to of-
fer election analysis.

The weekend has more than
just policical discussions. Will
Owens, the event’s second social
chair, says, “We are excited to
announce that Gov’t Mule will
help kick off the Mock Conven-
tion this spring term. Given their
ﬁtting name and musical creden-
tials, I don’t think we could have
asked for a better way to start the
Mock Convention.”

Gov’t Mule member Warren
Haynes is best known from the
Allman Brothers Band. With
the help of GAB, this Grammy
nominated band will play out-
doors on Cannan Green Satur-
day, May 26.

Though the actual Conven-
tion is still 10 months away, the
political staff is maintaining a

times per day to keep the stu-«

dent body posted on both Spring

litical news.

senior pledge trainer. He called
for a Blue Book review commit-
tee made up of students to revise
current judicial policy.

“SAC ’s involvement. . .
[suppresses] the voice of the stu-
dent body,” he said.

The IF C ’s Flannigan, however,
said established procedure must
be followed. “You can’t commit
the wrong and then change the
rules. The rules of the game are
established at the onset of new
member education, he said.”

“Everybody knows them,”
Dean Watkins added. “Hazing
is inconsistent with the values
of theuniversity and the values
espoused by every fraternity at
W&L.”

Director of Student Activities
and Greek Life Jason Rodocker
said, “The student body needs to
address the attitude that ‘we will
do bad things to new members be-
cause it was done to us when we
were new members,”’ he said.

Nevertheless, Rodocker ex-
pressed conﬁdence in the Greek
system’s ability to move forward
from these hazing investigations
and severe sanctions in a con-
structive and eductational man-
ner: “College is an educational
process and it is expected that
students will make mistakes...

admit [them], accept the con-'

sequences, and change your be-
havior accordingly.  The ulti-
mate goal is to move the campus
community and its individuals
in the right direction.”

“The IFC’s handling of the
investigations during new mem-
ber education is a great example
of student‘ governance,” he add-
ed.

Dean Watkins concurs. “I
think the Greek system’s in re-
ally good shape... I’m seeing
an IFC that’s doing its job and
fraternities that are responding
well to working with the IF C...
that ’s a Greek system that is ever
mindful of how to address con-
cerns and build on strengths.”

Hunter, the Kappa Sigma
president, said he thought the
judicial system worked in a fair
and efficient manner.

“The disciplinary process
within the university is delib-
erate and efﬁcient, and works
as it is intended. We had great
experiences dealing with Jason
Rodocker, Dean Watkins, Dean
Dotson, and the SAC... Really,
we’re just excited to have the
situation behind us, and to move
forward.”

That’s certainly a sentiment
Watkins shares. “I want to see
a healthy Greek system and
healthy students,” she said.

THE RING-TUM PHI ° 3

 

’->7

With Senator John Warner
coming to campus this week-
end to speak about public ser-
vice and the Shepherd Pov-
erty Program, this seems like
a good time to let the campus
in on a little secret.

While the rest of us have
been busy worrying about
Fancy Dress and Mock Con-
vention, Professor Harlan
Beckley has quietly been
changing the poverty program
from a small department into
a national project.

Beckley started the Shep-
herd program in 1997. A de-
cade later, he has the program
poised to expand to at least
ten schools. If Warner is able
to obtain the federal funding
that he’s working to garner,
the consortium could be up
and running within just a few
years. If the first ﬁve years of

"the project go well, the pro-
gram has the deﬁnite potential
to keep expanding.

There is little doubt that
Beckley’s work has solidiﬁed
his reputation as one of the
school’s most respected pro-
fessors, and it’s not surprising

that Beckley was selected to
serve as W&L’s acting-presi-
dent last year when Tom Bur-
ish left for Notre Dame.

W&L’s social scene might
be famous across the South,
but the Shepherd program
may soon make the school
famous nationwide, and for
far more important and mean-
ingful reasons. The Shepherd
interns who serve in the D.C.
Public Defender’s ofﬁce or
the D.C. Central Kitchen are
exposing thousands of Ameri-
cans — from people in abject
poverty to U.S. Senators ~ to
our school.

The Shepherd program is
doing more than just helping
people far from Lexington.
Though the Campus Kitch-
ens Project operates inde-
pendently of Beckley and the
Shepherd alliance, it is show-
ing Rockbridge County that
our school has more to it than
noisy country parties.

Beckley knows that not all
students in his Poverty 101
class or evenin the Shepherd
program will devote their ca-
reers to eradicating poverty.

He’s ﬁne with that.

What Beckley really wants
to do is make W&L students
aware that poverty exists as
a serious — if sometimes hid-
den — issue in American soci-
ety. He’s succeeding with this
goal, and people beyond the
walls of this campus are start-
ing to notice.

People in the business
world know about the high
quality graduates the Wil-
liams School produces each
year. Medical schools admit
W&L students at levels far
exceeding the national aver-
age. The journalism depart-
ment has a two-time Pulitzer
Prize winner and another pro-
fessor who is regularly quoted
by the New York Times on
ethics issues.

These departments have
long enjoyed a strong reputa-
tion in their respective ﬁelds.
Now Beckley and the Shep-
herd program are joining them
in national circles.

As this groundbreaking
program expands, W&L stu-
dents need to stop and thank
its founder.

Celebrating the
unsung generals

March 21 gala recognizes behind-the-scenes students

By Grace Andrews
0 0 L U M N IST

As many Washington and Lee
University students are aware, we
are volunteer-a-holics.

Everyone has a friend who
volunteers at Waddell, tutors at
the high school or and even reads
to little ones at the library. It al-
most seems as if service is a built
in requirement to graduate here.

However, some of us also
know those individuals who only
volunteer to make themselves
look better and build up their re-
sumes.

You have probably seen him
or her half-heartedly doing volun-
teer work when they think no one
is watching, but as soon as you
add an audience, they are super
volunteer.

Let me present an example.
So, there’s an old lady cross-
ing the street. She is so old that
it looks like she may have went
to grade school with Plato. She is
walking a little slow and her little
old lady arms are weighed down
with large grocery sacks.

The “I only volunteer to build
my resume” looks around and if
no one is there, the phony helper
will walk right past the grandma
and proceed across the street.

However, the “I volunteer and
help out because I care” will stop
whatever they are doing to grab
granny’s bags and hold her hand
as they cross the street together.

Do you see the difference be-
tween these two people?

DING DING DING, one is

One is a truly selfless person while
the other may deserve to get hit with
a I 0-speed mountain bike.

truly a selﬂess person while the
other may deserve to get hit with
a 10-speed mountain bike.

For those of you who do vol-
unteer and/or provide a service
to others, I want to thank you.
Helping is deﬁnitely one of the
best things that you can do and
the feeling that it gives you is in-
valuable.

For those of you who do not
volunteer or do volunteer sans
pep in your step, I recommend
that you step it up. As cliché as
it is, by helping others you help
yourself and that is what life is all
about.

So many organizations and
clubs on campus do worthwhile
activities and raise awareness
on various issues. Being a part
of these organizations is another
way to provide a service for our
campus. Who knows, you may
discover the hidden leader within
yourself.

One day when you are old and
decrepit, don’t you want to look
back on your youth with pride?
How can you do that if all you did
was party and fall asleep in class?
There are endless possibilities for
helping around our campus, so
there is no excuse not to.

Thankfully our campus has

more of those selﬂess types than
anything else. I would like to in-
vite everyone reading this article
to attend the Celebrating Student
Success Gala on March 21 at
6:30p.m. in Lee Chapel.

W&L strives to be an active
and vibrant community. Our stu-
dent leaders are often at the core
of this excitement.

The Celebrating Student Suc-
cess Initiative recognizes those
students who contribute to uni-
versity life in ways often not seen
to the average on-looker. A joint
student-staff committie sought
the “un-sung heroes” who work
hard behind the scenes to make
W&L all that it is.

We celebrate all of their
achievements by presenting the
“John W. Elrod Unsung General
of the Year Award”, and have
planned a campus wide awards
ceremony in Lee Chapel.

This unique initiative provides
a means of celebrating the accom-
plishments of a diverse group of
students in a campus assembly,
providing a spotlight on the good
things our students provide both
to the campus and the wider Lex-
ington community.

No phony helper types will be
celebrated, only the real deals.

Lee on the IFC, hazing

Fraternities should decide what deﬁnes hazing in a Greek honor system

By Cody Beauchamp
C 0 LU M N I S T

The IFC has come under criti-
cism lately for the way it attempt-
ed to handle and discourage haz-
ing during Washington and Lee’s
latest “New Member Education”
period (i.e.: “pledgeship”).

Joining in as targets of criti-
cism were the fraternities, pledg-
es, administrators, and, well, just
about everybody else

It seems that no one is very
satisﬁed by the way hazing was
prevented during pledgeship. No
one seemed very happy with the
transparency—more appropri-
ately the lack thereof—that the
IFC and co. showed this year in
investigating and punishing haz-
ing violations.

During the last eight weeks
rumors ﬂew everywhere; on any
given day, it seemed any given
fraternity was being investigated.

The IFC took a lot of heat for
not being forthcoming in how
they were handling various ac-
cusations of hazing. When they
did come forward, they were met
with criticism. They worked hard,
did their best, and still seemed to
please no one. (I didn’t know the
IF C was a pledge.)

Next year they should save
themselves all this trouble by tak-
ing a very R.E. Lee approach to
hazing—no tolerance for infrac-
tions, whatsoever.

If a fraternity is found to have
hazed their pledges, they should
be immediately dismissed from
the school, for a period of at least
four years. President Lee would
probably say indeﬁnitely, but that
would never ﬂy with the IF C.

The IFC, for its part, should
not codify what is or is not haz-
ing. Like the EC, it should rather

The IF C should rather seek to rule
based on what is believes the current
generation would deﬁne as hazing.

seek to rule based on what it be-
lieves the current generation of
Greeks would deﬁne hazing to be.
It would be a Greek honor “sys-
tem,” not “code.”

Like the Honor System, the fra-
ternities should be able to appeal
to the wider population that the
IFC represents. Not to the SAC;
it’s my opinion that they, frankly,
should be no more involved in my
fratemity’s internal business than
MSA, the Club Ultimate Frisbee
Team or any other non-Greek or-
ganization for that matter.

If the IF C rules a fraternity
guilty, the organization should be
able to appeal the decision in a
hearing open to all Greeks.

Again, independents, by their
own election to stay independent,
have absolutely no right to be in-
volved in Greek business. Sorry,
indies, if that’s harsh. A panel of
randomly selected fellow Greeks
should be able to review the IFC’s
decision following the hearing.

Like in the regular honor sys-
tem, the fraternity should have to
make a sacriﬁce for its appeal——
the fraternity loses its right to pri-
vacy concerning its actions.

If the fraternity believes its
super-secret version of a line-up
isn’t hazing, it shouldn’t be dis-
missed without the chance to ap-
peal—but it doesn’t get to keep it
a secret.

It’s a rough deal, but then
again, the pledges involved could

probably tell you about rough
deals. Get over it.

The beneﬁts of this approach
would solve almost all of the cur-
rent system’s problems.

To begin with, the fratemities
would be on their best behavior.
There would be no toeing-the-
line because A) the fraternities
wouldn’t know exactly where the
line is, and B) they would be ter-
riﬁed of crossing it. .

Alternatively, much like the
honor system for students, the
fraternities would be given com-
plete discretion over their actions
as long as the trust invested in the
fraternity isn’t violated.

If this generation’s fratemi-
ties don’t see branding the lyrics
to “Sweet Caroline” on the fore-
heads of their members as hazing,
it wouldn’t be considered such
and the frats would be allowed
to do what they have no problem
with.

On the other side of the spec-
trum, if this generation of Greeks
decides that making pledges know
the full name of their own frater-
nity offends their general senti-
ments too much, they would de-
ﬁne that as hazing and it wouldn’t
be allowed.

This works for all involved-
the Greek community gets to col-
lectively decide what it deems
acceptable. The fraternity gets to
appeal. The IFC as meddlcr or
protector (depending on whether

or .not your fraternity is under
accusation) must justify its deci-
sions to the population it serves.

Outside of Greek life, students
of W&L have all agreed to live by
a system of honor. It’s a delicate
and potentially-harsh system, but
we elect to live by it because it
works.

It’s not the easiest thing to do,
but we all do it because in agree-
ing to hold ourselves to the highest
standards, we also get the greatest
amounts of trust and discretion
from everyone else pledged to
that system.

Why not adopt General Lee’s
approach to life to the Greek
system? If the Greeks all are the
upstanding organizations they
profess to be, why should we not
hold them accountable by a simi-
lar set of standards to the one we
as individuals live by?

Hazing would be eradicated
by the specter of a penalty analo-
gous to the penalties that eradi-
cate cheating and stealing. At the
same time, the fraternities would
be given the discretion they de-
sire.

The IFC and administration
also beneﬁts from having a far
more concretely-deﬁned role.
Even pledges beneﬁt from the
system because it would ensure
that their future brothers treat
them with the respect brothers
should show one another.

When it comes to living hon-
orably, we don’t place individuals
on super-extra-serious-we-really-
REALLY-mean-it-this-time pro-
bation.

If they violate our communal
trust, we expel them from our
community. Should the collec-
tions of these individuals called
“fratemities” or “sororities” be
any different?

Tragic romance arrived from Russia

Last week, the Len-
fest Series featured
professional balleri-
nas from Moscow in
two performances in
the Keller Theater.
This event was made
possible largely by a
generous donation
from the class of
1964. Tuesday night,
the group performed
Don Quixote, a
romantic and adven-
turous performance
of Cervantes’ literary
work. On Wednes-
day, the group
performed Giselle
(all photos taken

at the Wednesday
night performance
of Giselle). Dancers
stunned spectators
as they acted out the
sad story of Giselle,
a peasant woman
who is in love with a
nobleman in dis-
guise, Loys. Though r
Giselle believes him
to be a peasant, the
man's true name

is Albrecht, and

he is engaged to a
woman of his own
class. When Giselle
discovers this truth,
she dies of a broken

heart. Giselle is able

to return temporar-
ily to save Albrecht
from the evils of
Wilis, who appears
to make him suffer.
She spares him and
offers her forgive-
ness for his decep-
tion. They declare
their love for one
another, but Giselle
must return to her
grave. Their love is
established, but the
tragedy remains that
they will be physi-
cally apart. The Mos-

Spoken word calls for action

Actors emphasize signiﬁcance of individual contributions by Americans in Darfur crisis

By Jess Ramos
STAFF WRITER

Poetry, rap and drama are the
new methods to promote action
and awareness towards the crisis
in Darfur.

Last Tuesday, Chapmyn Spo-
ken Word presented “The Road to
Darfur,” a choreopoem by James
H. Chapmyn. Chapmyn Spoken
Word, headed by James H. Chap-
myn, is a three-man acting troupe

“Each of us is re-
sponsible for do-
ing what we can to
change thelworld. ”

CHAPMYN SPOKEN WORD,
actors raisng awareness

that uses different performance
styles and multimedia to convey
important messages and issues.

The Student Association for
International Learning (SAIL)
and Amnesty International spon-
sored Chapmyn Spoken Word’s
appearance at Washington and
Lee. However, this is not the ﬁrst
time events raising awareness for
Darfur have surfaced on campus.

This past November, Wash-
ington and Lee’s Amnesty Inter-
national chapter raised awareness
about Darfur, selling t-shirts say-
ing “Save Darfur.” Some Am-
nesty members also fasted for 24
hours.

Around the same time, SAIL
put together “Showcase for Su-

Panelists promote female leaders

dan,” a talent show. In addition
to raising awareness about Dar-
fur, “Showcase for Sudan” raised
about $1,000 for the victims in
Darfur.

Chapmyn’s choreopoem, “The
Road to Darfur,” focused on the
present-day genocide in western
Sudan’s Darfur region. Accord-
ing to a United Nations report,
two million Darfurians have been
displaced and over 400,000 have
been killed.

While most people are familiar
with statistics, Chapmyn Spoken
Word presented the information
in a new way. Images of Darfur’s
human suffering combined with
singing, poetry and drama provid-
ed another approach to empower,
engage, encourage and entertain.
Through their unique presenta-
tion, Chapmyn Spoken Word en-
couraged audience members to be
aware and to act.

To Chapmyn Spoken Word,
awareness meant grappling with
the hypocrisy in silence. “People
are dying because people don’t
care,” said Chapmyn. Chapmyn
Spoken Word highlighted the hy-
pocrisy that exists everywhere.
The Sudanese government denies
the genocide, leading to suspicions
that the government is behind the
militia groups responsible.

The United States deplores the
genocide, yet the lust .fox;..money
and power impede it from stop-
ping the genocide, said Chapmyn
Spoken Word. Dependence on
Sudanese oil furthers greed and
ﬁnances genocide. Yet, as part of
the global community, everyone
is connected and equally respon-
sible for ending this crisis. Since
the time of King, Gandhi and So-
journer Truth, Chapmyn Spoken

Chapmyn Spoken Word performers engage viewers last Tuesday to encourage individual action in Darfur crlsls.

Word said today’s technology has
made it possible to act against this
genocide.

Though “the road to Darfur
is paved with silence,” one can
overcome hypocrisy through ac-
tions, said Chapmyn Spoken
Word. By not buying Sudanese
oil, the world has stopped ﬁnanc-
ing genocide. For individual ac-
tion, Chapmyn Spoken Word of-

fered two ways to help.

First, one must hold the sell-
ers and manufacturers account-
able, challenging them to make
their products better. An example
Chapmyn Spoken Word used was
the numerous little tags in cloth-
ing, when only one tag is needed.
Creating better products more ef-
ﬁciently diminishes dependence
on Sudanese oil. One must also

make people around them aware
by talking about this issue and
holding each other accountable.
Though deceptively insigniﬁ-
cant, the individual ideas and ac-
tions inﬂuence groups, which in
turn inﬂuence larger institutions
to act. A recent CNN.com story
posted on March 14, 2007 stated
that the U.S. government is now
preparing to impose new eco-

nomic sanctions upon Sudanese
companies.

Although individual action is
on a small scale, all little actions
combined can change the world.
By listening to the “inner voice,”
one can do miracles. Every indi-
vidual has a purpose, said Chap-
myn Spoken Word. “Each of us
is responsible for doing what we
can to change the world.”

KEWL hosted a panel last Thursday to showcase accomplishments and obstacles facing women leaders on this campus

By Jessica Shaw
ARTS & LIFE EDITOR

Professor Pam Simpson
equated her early years to a
trial.

In I973, she entered a sea of
testosterone as the ﬁrst female
professor at Washington and
Lee. At times struggling to meet
her rent, Simpson experienced
rejection from local banks that
refused to loan money to wom-
en because of their supposed in-
ability to be trusted in the work-
force. At work, Simpson was
overwhelmed with frustration
that her opinion was drowned
out by male voices around her.

“That’s kind of the dark days
of discrimination,” she said.
“Anytime I said something,
nobody listened. Then the law
dean would repeat what I said,
and then they’d hear it.”

Though the road was rocky,
Simpson said the path to gender
equality in this community has
been overwhelmingly positive.
She was able to relate her strug-
gles and accomplishments to a
small audience in the Commons
Theater last Thursday night.

Joining Simpson on the panel
hosted by Knowledge Empow-
ering Women Leaders (KEW),
were deans Dawn Watkins and
Elizabeth Knapp, romance lan-
guages professor Domnica Rad-
ulescu and students Justine Dar-
gahi and Margaret Elkins.

All six panelists expressed _

to their audience that women
have made leaps and bounds in

“If women students are not seeing women in

leadership roles, that sends such a message.

That sends a message that that :9 not what wom-

en are doing, and that’s not the right message.

DAWN WATKINS, dean of student affairs
 

the direction of equality, but that
there is still much to be desired.

A big push by KEWL in the
past year has been to gain more
female representation in the ad-
ministration.

Watkins agreed with this idea,
saying, “If women students are
not seeing women in leadership
roles, that sends such a message.
That sends a message that that’s
not what women are doing, and
that’s not the right message.”

Knapp, a graduate of the
second co-ed class at W&L,
said she beneﬁted tremendously
from having female role models
and mentors.

“I had never really worked
with or been educated by a
woman with family,” she said.
“I remember being terriﬁed
watching this woman who did
an amazing job in every area of
her life and see that all of these
things are attainable. It really
changed my belief in myself
and what I could do.”

Watkins said that it is cru-
cial to represent a diversity of
perspectives in administrative
roles. ‘

“I think it’s across the board

that there are different perspec-
tives that need to be represent-
ed, because things just getileft
out of the equation,” she said.
“There are things that will just
get missed.”

Elkins, who recently ran for
president of the Executive Com-
mittee, said it was difﬁcult for
her to compete with her male
counterparts.

“It was really difﬁcult to be
assertive and feel like I was
taken seriously, even if I was,”
she said. “I think especially on
this campus for some reason,
especially running against these
other great male leaders, it’s re-

ally hard.”

Watkins commended Elkins
for entering the election.

“The fact that Margaret ran
sends a signal that it’s okay that
women are running,” she said.
“We’ve got to encourage other
women to run again and again
and again. And women will sue-
ceed; they have in the past, and
they will in the future.”

Radelescu, the co-founder of
the Women’s Studies Program
at W&L, said she wants to see
this discipline grow.

“I would like to bring the
Women’s Studies Program in
sync with other women’s stud-
ies programs at competitive in-
stitutions,” she said.

“I would like to see the pro-
gram become a major-—right
now it’s a concentration. I would
like to help it push into that next
level.”

Responding to a question

about advice to give females on I

campus, Radelescue said it is
important to be the best at what-
ever one pursues. She explained

that this makes discrimination
a fun challenge, because one is
equipped to dispel it.

“Don’t let society and the
world tell you that you can’t be
what you are,” she said, “And
that you can’t have family and
a career, because look at us; we
have all of that.”

Regina Mills, the vice presi-
dent of KEWL, acknowledges
the signiﬁcance of the message
of female leaders for both men
and women at W&L.

“I think one, it’s important to
get it to men--to have them rec-
ognize that women leadership is
a priority and a necessity,” Mills
said. “And for women, it’s to
see these role models of these
women who are in power and to
take their example and empower
themselves and to say, ‘hey, this
is right, I think I should ﬁght for

this.’”

All of the panelists expressed
excitement about the appoint-
ment of new provost, June
Aprille. Paten Hughes, Presi-
dent of KEWL and panel facili-
tator, said it is important to rec-
ognize the reasons Aprille was
chosen to become W&L’s head
academic ofﬁcer.

“I think it’s important to
have women leaders and also
to know that she wouldn’t have
been chosen if she wasn’t the
best candidate out of the pool of
women and men,” Hughes said.

Dargahi explained why she
felt women on campus should
be celebrated.

“It’s always hardest to be
that ﬁrst person, to take that
ﬁrst step, to get through that
ﬁrst door,” Dargahi said. “By
acknowledging that, it makes it
easier for the second.”

Men's Swimming

The Generals ﬁnished in
eighth place this weekend at
the D-Ill NCAA champion-
ships. That mark ties the
1989 squad for the best ﬁnish
in program history. Senior
Mike Ginder and Junior Alex
Sweet both won First Team
All—America honors for their
performances. Ginder ﬁn-
ished fourth in the 200m free,
while Sweet ﬁnished sixth in
the 100m free. Sweet’s time
of 45.24 broke his own school
record. Ginder and Sweet
joined Tim McGlaston and
Dave Croushore in the 400m
free relay, ﬁnishing sixth with
a time of 3:03.80, also a new

 

school record. Croushore and
McGlaston were also named
First Team All-Americans.
The same four swimmers

also competed in the 200m
free relay, ﬁnishing second
with a time just one-tenth of
a second behind the winning
team from Kenyon. Kenyon
went on to win the team title
as well. Sweet and Ginder
also joined Paul Crook and
Brett Tatman to grab a third
place ﬁnish in the 800m free
relay. That ﬁnish also won
the four swimmers First Team
All-American status. Ginder
was also named an Honorable
Mention All-American for

his ninth place ﬁnish in the
200m backstroke, while Sweet
was honorable mention in the
200m free.

Men's Lacrosse

The men’s lacrosse team
bounced back from a rough
start to its season and notched
two decisive non-conference
victories last week. The team
broke its losing streak on
Monday by thumping Hood
College 24-1. 16 Generals
found the back of the net as
the team raced out to a 12-0
halftime lead and kept up the
pressure until the ﬁnal horn.
On Saturday the men picked
up a big road win, knocking
off Franklin and Marshall
College by a score of 10-3.
The game was played at St.
Paul’s School in Brookland-
ville, Md. Just like they had
against Hood, the men jumped
out to a quick lead, scoring
the ﬁrst six goals and taking
a 7-1 halftime lead. Junior
attacker Ned Rider led the
charge against Hood, scoring
three goals and adding an as-
sist during the ﬁst half. Senior
Grant Martin and freshman
Max Mancuso also added four
points, as six Generals scored

. two goals each. W&L domi-

nated every facet of the game,
taking 80 shots to Hood’s 16.
Goalies Alex Heaton and Matt
Mason for W&L were forced
to make just three saves, while
Hood junior Sam Hoﬁnann
stopped 22 saves during his
60 minutes in the net. Senior
Jim Ryan was the star against
F&M, burying three goals.
Will Englehart and Harry

St. John also added a pair of
goals.

STAFF WRITER

Generals outdoor track and
ﬁeld opened their season strongly
at the Washington and Lee Invi-
tational Saturday. W&L won the
meet with 208 points. The wom-
en took second place with 128
points behind Mary Washington,
who put up 136. The men ﬁn-
ished third behind West Chester
and Westmont.

Overall, the Generals have a
positive outlook for the rest of the
season. “We are a young team
with a lot of freshman and sopho-
mores; we are going to continue
to improve over the course of the
year and for the next couple of
years,” said freshman Billy Bil-
lington.

Individually, both teams had
some strong performers. The
men were led by big performanc-
es from underclassmen. Fresh-
man Joseph Roane ﬁnished ﬁrst
in the triple jump with a 12.06m
performance, while Joel Poelhuis
won the pole vault by clearing ten
and a,half feet. Billington placed
second in the discus with a throw
of 38.53m, and sophomore Brad
Bender took second in the long
jump with a 5.72m leap.

The upperclassmen were not
absent, though. Junior Michael
Keenan placed second in the pole
vault, clearing nine feet and nine
inches. He also ﬁnished third in
the 110 meter hurdles with a time
of 20.82.

Sophomore Ben Wilson placed
third in the shot put with a 12.47m
effort, another strong throwing ef-
fort for the Generals, and senior
Andrew Fischer took third in the
javelin with a 46.03m toss.

The men struggled in the
sprints, grabbing nothing better
than Chip McCoy’s ﬁfth place
ﬁnish in the 400m dash. Marshall
French ﬁnished sixth in the 200m

Men and women combine to

and 400m, while Sean Hurdiss
took sixth in the 100m.

Robbie Varipapa, however,
helped pick things up in the mid-
dle distances with his fourth place
ﬁnish in the l500m.

In the women’s meet, the Gen-
erals put up four ﬁrst place per-
formances. Sophomore Elizabeth
Webb won the 5000 meters for the
Generals in a time of 18:32.21,
while sophomore Becca Taylor
recorded an impressive ﬁrst-place
ﬁnish in the 800 meters with a
time of 2:26.59.

Taylor was followed by team-
mate Dorothy Todd, whose time
of 2:31.76 was good for second
place and gave the Generals a 1-2
ﬁnish.

The 4x100 relay team of fresh-
man Sallie Armstrong, fresh-
man Dalena Moser, sophomore
Stephanie Stelter, and senior Sara
Behmerwohld also won, record-
ing in a time of 54.70.

Sophomore Tara Hildenbrand
and Moser also got on the board
in the 100m dash, ﬁnishing third
and fourth, respectively. '

Alysen Kuck continued the
Generals’ strong showing in jav-
elin, as she won the women’s
competition with a distance of
29.72m.

Additionally, other strong
performances were put in by the
women’s team. Armstrong, one of
the members of the 4x100 relay
team, also took second in the 400
meter hurdles in a time of 70.39.

Freshman Maggie Sutherland
took second place in the 1 10 meter
hurdles in 16.01 and the high jump
with a ﬁve foot effort. Kuck, Ali-
sha Laventure and Jamila Seaton
ﬁnished third through ﬁfth behind
Sutherland, giving the Generals
20 out of a possible 30 points in
the high jump.

The Generals will continue
their season on Friday, March 23
at the Richmond Invitational.

won easily, so it clearly didn’t
have an effect on them.”

In the doubles competition,
Mary Washington’s team of
Stephanie Kurti and Rebecca
Morse-Karzen won the No. 1
doubles match against Lauren
Caire and Katie Tabb 8-4, but
the Generals took the No. 2 and
No. 3 doubles matches to take a
2-1 lead going into the singles
competition.

W&L’s Emily Applegate:and
Kristen McClung defeated Kate
Miglin and Natalia Fugate 8-
2 in No. 2 doubles, and Ginny
Worthham and Leah Weston de-
feated Mary Washington’s Amy
Sheetz and Priscilla Jamison 8-
2.

In the singles competition the
Generals took ﬁve of six match-
es to secure a 7-2 victory. Tabb,
Wortham, Applegate, Will and
McClung all recorded victories
for the Generals.

The Generals have steam-
rolled their opponents in the
ODAC this season and have yet
to drop a single set in confer-
ence play. The team is looking
to claim its seventeenth ODAC
title. In their two ODAC match-
es this week, the Generals lost
a measly 17 games during 18
matches.

The team will make up Sun-
day’s rained out match at Ran-
dolph-Macon Women’s College
this Thursday before travelling
to Virginia Wesleyan Saturday.

In order to maintain fo-
cus during these matches, the
women ﬁnd speciﬁc goals like
working on new shots or always
winning service games to keep
their focus.

“Our team is extremely deep
and everyone contributes to our
success in ODAC matches,”
said Wortham.

The team is so deep, in fact,
that the Generals played both
Bridgewater and Roanoke on
Tuesday, sending half the team
to Bridgewater while the other
half stayed in Lexington.

This Wednesday the G,ener- ,

als take on Division I opponent
James Madison University.

The Dukes have started the
season 3-3. They lost to Rich-
mond University by a 6-1 score
on Wednesday.

Senior Lauren Graham has
led JMU this spring with a 4-
1 singles record. Graham and
freshman Kelly Maxwell have a
4-3 doubles record.

“JMU will be a great test for
us,” said Wortham. “A few of
us had the opportunity to play
them at Virginia Tech’s Invita-
tional this fall and I think it will
deﬁnitely help us prepare for the
caliber of teams we are going to
face in Texas at Fab Five.”

“JMU will deﬁnitely be a
challenge, but should hopefully
also be a match where we play
loose because there isn’t any-
thing to lose,” said Will. “Beat-
ing them would be great and I
think we can do it.”

continued from page 8

Parker lasted four and a third
innings for the Generals, giving
up seven hits and ﬁve runs. He
also walked two and struck out
four.

W&L jumped out to an ear-
ly ﬁrst inning lead when DH
Richard Garland doubled home

Terrence McKelvey and James .

Madden.

The Marlins plated their ﬁrst
run in the third inning by string-
ing together two singles after
Parker hit Hudgins with a pitch.
The Marlins got a second run in
the fourth after Ozz Dhramapi-
taks drove home Brandon Ha-
thaway on a sacriﬁce ﬂy. Ha-
thaway also reached base after
being hit by a pitch.

W&L answered that run in
the bottom of the inning when
Henderson singled home Gar-
land.

The real damage, however,
came in the top of the ﬁfth. The
Marlins strung together four
hits and a walk against Parker
and reliever Chuck Davidson,
eventually pushing three run-
ners across the plate.

Then W&L mounted its last
ditch ninth inning rally.

Davidson went two and two-
third innings, giving up ﬁve hits
and allowing just one run. Ju-
nior Jeff Pharis threw the ﬁnal
two innings.

To stay atop the ODAC
standings the Generals must
rebound quickly. They play at
Bridgewater on Wednesday.

Tennis goes

undefeated '

Women beat pair of ODA C foes
and defeat Mary Washington 7-2

By Michael Keenan
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee
women’s tennis team recorded
another undefeated week, tally-
ing two victories against ODAC
opponents Roanoke and Bridge-
water as well as a third vic-
tory against llth-ranked Mary
Washington. Mary Washington

is the second na-

s°°"° tionally ranked
W&L 7 team the Generals

have beaten this
MWU 2

season and the
ﬁrst they’Ve beat-
en away from home.

On Saturday, the women
traveled to F redericksburg, VA,
to take on No. 11 Mary Wash-
ington. The Eagles had just
returned from a very success-
ful 3-0 road trip to California
where they defeated Occidental
9-0, No. 10 Pomona Pitzer 5-4,
and No. 12 Redlands 6-3. The
trip helped boost Mary Wash-
ington’s national ranking from
No. 17 to No. ll and meant they
would be full of conﬁdence for
their home match up against the
No. 3 Generals.

“Mary Washington always
comes out gunning for us and

Saturday was no exception,”
said senior Ginny Wortham.
“They just came off of a very
successful trip to California and
so our win today was really im-

portant for ranking reasons ancﬂ

because it is nice to play well
against a conﬁdent team.”

The match was played inside
Mary Washington’s University
Tennis Center where loud fans
had gathered to support the Ea-
gles.

“We played indoors and
the Mary Washington players
and fans really got behind and
cheered loudly for their team,
said Wortham. “I think its re-
ally'hard but important to try to
block out the environment and
just focus on your court.”

The mental toughness of the
Generals was put to the test,
but the women rose to the chal-
lenge.

“The crowd at Mary Wash
is always loud and constantly
cheering so the element of focus
is really important,” said junior
Kelly Will. “However, many of
us have dealt with it before so it
doesn’t have as strong of an ef-
fect as it could and the freshmen

VOLUME cx, NuMsEn;4'/7

Sig Ep avoids ﬁraticide by joining up with local Kiwanis Club

By Edward Frattlngton IV
STAFF WRITER

The Student Affairs Com-
mittee voted last night to per-
ma.nently disband all of Wash-
ington and Lee ’s fraternities.

The SAC’s decision came
after a marathon six-hour
meeting that included testimo-
ny from members of each of
the 14 fraternities currently ac-
tive on campus. Though each
frat spoke with the committee,
members of the Phi Gamma
Delta delegation provided the
most detailed explanations.
Delegates from Phi Kappa
Sigma and Phi Delta Theta
refused to comment, while

Sigma Alpha Epsilon threat-
ened to have its high-powered
alumni donate enough money
to purchase the entire SAC.

Sigma Phi Epsilon argued
that it should be exempt be-
cause it only returned to cam-
pus last year, but the chapters
pleas fell on deaf and uncaring
ears.

A last minute compromise,
however, turned the SPE house
into Kiwanis local 92.

The charge was led by the
faculty members on the SAC.
They complained about the
noise and garbage created by
fraternity parties. They also
said fraternities encouraged
revelry and distracted W&L

students from the serious busi-
ness of studying.

One of the faculty mem-
bers complained that the male
Greek system made “freshman
students fall asleep in class
during winter term.”

The dismissal followed a
wave of hazing investigations
that kept the IF C and Director
of Public Safety Mike Young
busy for weeks. Though the
investigations could only turn
up hard evidence against FIJI,
Kappa Sigma and SAE, the
other frats were dismissed
from campus “as a precau-
tion.”

“We know for a fact that
those Phi Delts and Phi Kaps

are not being very nice to their
poor little freshman,” one
SAC member said. “We could
have done a full investigation
on each of the 14 houses, but
it just seemed so much easier
to dismiss each frat at the same
time.”

Dean of Students Dawn
Watkins voted for dismissal
but also told the ex-frat boys
that she was sure everything
would work out just ﬁne. She
offered each fraternity a box
of free Girl Scout cookies as a
parting gift.

As members of each fra-
ternity packed up their frat
rooms and headed for Gaines
Hall, one morose Kappa Alpha

sophomore was seen sitting
with his head in his hands.

“I just don't see how was
can have Old South in a Gaines
suite," he muttered sadly.

By order from the SAC, all
frat houses had to be vacated
by the end of the day.

Chi Psi brothers were all
too hungover from the prior
nights 54th straight Late Nite
to object that they actually
own their house instead of the
school. Multiple northface
jackets, cell phones, and lone
shoes were left in the empty
basement.

The school is already
searching for ways to ﬁll the
suddenly empty buildings.

Director of Student Activities
and Greek Life Jason Rodock-
er said the school was seri-
ously considering inviting 14
new sororities to colonize on
campus.

Rodocker said Delta Zeta
sorority was being heavily re-
cruited because their DePauw
University chapter had shown
a real talent for judging wom-
en on shallow characteristics
like looks and skin color. The
DePauw group earned national
notoriety in February when
their national headquarters
forcibly dismissed more than
half of the chapters members

the Dean of Richmond’s Jepsom
Leadership School. An alumnus
of W&L, Ruscio served as Dean

sen last month to replace Tom
Williams as the W&L provost.
Rodney A. Smolla, Dean of Law

In a shocking move last night,
President Ken Ruscio announced
that a $1 billion donation by
alumni Gerry Lenfest would al-
low Washington and Lee to pur-
chase the University of Richmond
and turn it into a satellite campus.
The campus will be called Wash-
ington and Lee at Richmond or
W&L-R.

Ruscio admitted that the take-
over plans began in 2001, when
he left his position in the W&L
oolitics department to become

of Freshman before moving into
the politics department. He was
also instrumental in the founding
of the interdisciplinary Environ-
mental Studies program. Act-
ing under guidance from Rector
Phillip Norwood and the board
of trustees, Ruscio carefully inﬁl-
trated the Richmond campus and
recruited several important fac-
ulty members to his cause.
Among the faculty recruited
by Ruscio was June Aprille, the
Richmond provost who was cho-

at the University of Richmond
and the incoming law dean at
W&L, also joined Ruscio’s ca-
bal.

Students at the former Univer-
sity of Richmond said they were
thrilled to now attend a more
prestigious and historical univer-
sity.

“Nobody around this state
cared about U of R,” one student
complained, “but now I’m going
to have a degree from W&L-R
that will deﬁnitely get me a sweet

job because of alumni connec-
tions.”

The student asked that his
name not be used because he was
afraid nobody would hire him if
they knew his real name.

The plan kicked into high gear

in the spring of 2005, when for- _

mer W&L president Torn Burish
left the university and became
the provost at Notre Dame. Al-
though Burish’s departure was
supposedly voluntary, students
pressured him into departing be-
cause he kept trying to close the
doors to Traveller’s stall.

“We iust couldn’t stand Bur-

ish,” one student who requested
anonymity said. “That’s why we
asked the ghosts of Lee and Trav-

eller to drive him out.”

During the year spent by Har-
lan Beckley as W&L’s acting-
president, Ruscio made his ﬁnal
preparations at Richmond and
got ready for his move to Lex-

By Angry Current Students

Freshman move-in day may
still be ﬁve months away, but the
incoming class of 2011 is wast-
ing no time leaving its mark on
Washington and Lee.

After months of clogging up
the precious brick sidewalks
during ofﬁcial tours, the group

The precocious youngsters
have also been active on Face-
book, happily spewing out the
misinformation they learned
during their 48-hour visits to
campus. Each male student has
also been providing detailed
analysis of the fraternity and
party scene on campus.

Atlanta resident David Wal-
ton made history this week when
he became the ﬁrst freshman to
be balled from every fraternity
house before he even set foot
on campus (He also became the
ﬁrst student to ever be discussed
in the student press before arriv-
ing on campus).

Walton has been a frequent ,

contributor to the group and was
pleased to let everyone know
that he is a George Washington
scholar. Several current and fu-
ture students quickly told him
that they could not care less.

Walton is the incoming class’s
resident expert on the W&L so-
cial scene and offered several
wildly inaccurate—albeit hi-
larious~anecdotes about party-
ing on campus. He appears to
have discovered that students on
campus occasionally consume
beer and liquor—sometimes
even to excess—while spending
their evenings crowded around
a palette ﬁre or stuffed into a
fraternity basement.

Walton also won 1,700 en-
emies when he proudly told

dently ﬁled a report on the so-
cial scene at the ﬁnals, telling
the world about the exciting Chi
Psi party at Fallout——his infor-
mational sources on campus
still have not shown much im-
provement.

When reminded that Fallout
is actually a Phi Psi house, Wal-
ton refused to comment.

Ralph Stenson from Win-
ston-Salem has also established
himself as another standout in
the 2011 entrants. Stenson said
on the class’s F acebook site that
he wouldn’t wait for the excit-
ing fall term. .

“Fall term is supposed to be
siiicckkkk [sic],” Stenson said.

“It’s like tryouts for frat lords.
But I heard you can get balled
for stupid things. However, free
beer and drugs are worth the
risk.”

Stenson was quickly in-
formed that e-mails like the one
he had just sent fell under the
category of “stupid things.”

Stenson, like several other
future Generals, is hoping to
play a sport at W&L. He is
preparing to be a sick laxer and
also hopes to play on the soccer
team. He also said that he did
not want to observe the athletic
department’s policy of staying
sober the night before games
because he is good enough to
score three goals while battling
a monster hangover.

Lucas Stratton, a lacrosse

hopeful from San Francisco,
has been wowing future class-
mates with thrilling stories from
his earlier visits. He claims to
have ridden from one party to
the next at 4 a.m. on the top of
someone’s Jeep Wrangler, prov-
ing that he is both a liar and
also extremely stupid. What on
Earth was the admissions office
smoking the day they decided to
let this dummy come to W&L?
History professor H.P. Por-
ter, a W&L alumnus and long-
time member of the faculty, was
thrilled to hear that the incom-
ing class was once again the
best class in university history.
Porter has been saying for years
that the school keeps adding
the brightest class ever, mean-
ing that students probably get

dumber during their tenure in
Lexington.

Though the new students will
arrive with shining reputations,
Porter is prepared to break their
will during his 100 level intro-
duction to European civiliza-
tion. The grades of H, S and
even Z- often send freshman
students crying to their parents.
Porter’s upper—level students
often take time off from their
study of South Africa, Canada
or other mundane Common-
wealth states to comfort the dis-
traught freshmen.

Walton and other students
spent several weeks bragging
about their AP scores and the
upcoming AP tests, but it ap-
pears none of them will attempt
to graduate without ever setting

foot in Lexington. Some, how-
ever, hope to ﬁnish up during
their ﬁrst semester in order to
avoid pledgeship.

Summer Lollie, who lives
in the Dallas suburbs, also at-
tracted attention when she used
“LOL” more than once per sen-

tence in several of her Facebook .

e-mails. Unfortimately, nobody
had the heart to tell her that only
12-year-olds still use that sort of
slang in e-mails.

The ﬁnal word on the illustri-
ous Class of 2011 was provided
by Malcolm Hines, a current
W&L freshman from Rich-
mond.

“Congrats to all you kid-
dies,” Hines said. “But trust

The ongoing proposal to move
the Museum of the Confederacy
from Richmond to Lexington is
still facing intense criticism from
members of the Lexington area.

In the midst of the criticism,
there is also some doubt about
whether the museum’s move will
have the effects on tourism many
claim is a selling point for bring-
ing the museum to Lexington.

Waite Rawls, the museum’s
Executive Director, said the mu-
seum is considering relocation to
Lexington in hopes of increased
visitation for the institution.
Rawls said that the location of
both VMI and Washington and
Lee in Lexington is “obviously
synergistic” to the Museum.

Chief among Rawls’s claims
is that the museum, VMI and
Washiiigton and Lee share simi-

Washington and Lee Universi-
ty graduate H.F. “Gerry” Lenfest
announced that he will donate
$33 million to his alma mater to
increase faculty compensation.
The gift is the largest in the uni-
versity’s history.

Lenfest, a 1953 graduate and
former member of W&L’s board
of trustees, is grateful for the op-
portunity to give to an organiza-
tion that taught him more than
just academics.

“Like most people who gradu-
ate from W&L, the experience
and what you learn there follows
you throughout life,” said Len-
fest. “l’ve had the chance to give
back.”

Lenfest’s donation will be
used solely to increase salaries

ery as the cause of the war; in spite of historic

evidence to the contrary. I ﬁnd that argument

lar scholarly interests, and visi-
tors to Lexington, because of the
schools’ collections of Jackson
and Lee artifacts will be attracted
to a relocated museum.

This claim that the museum
and the colleges share scholarly
interests has been sharply contest-
ed by Dr. Ted DeLaney of W&L’s
history department.

“The irony is that Rawls gives
lip service to modern scholarship
over the origins of the Civil War,”
said DeLaney.

DeLaney said that the museum
is, in his experience, an institution

and beneﬁts for existing faculty.
W&L Provost Tom Williams be-
lieves that his donation will keep
the university on par with the pay
scale of other top institutions.

“I think it will have an imme-
diate effect for someone looking
at W&L versus another school
that pays more,” said Williams.
“They might want to be here, but
have to consider whether they can
afford the pay cut. We’re below
the mean in salaries and we want
to get there.”

Dean of the Williams School
Larry Peppers adds that W&L’s
small town location makes com-
pensation an even more important
subject.

“One issue we run into here is
opportunities for a spouse or part-
ner,” said Peppers. “There just
aren’t the same types of jobs that
you’d ﬁnd in DC.”

that draws proponents of Lost
Cause mythology in its presenta-
tion of the Civil War. “The old
Lost Cause argument. . .denies
slavery as the cause of the war,
in spite of historic evidence to the
contrary,” said DeLaney in a writ-
ten statement. “I ﬁnd that argu-
ment both wrong and offensive.”

DeLaney discussed an educa-
tional program he participated in
2006 as a panelist. The program
was sponsored by the University
of Richmond’s history depart-
ment and the museum.

DeLaney said the program

was “like living through a night-
mare.” He said the entirely white
audience that was present was
“representative of the negative
baggage that comes with the Mu-
seum of the Confederacy,” saying
all of them were “Lost Cause die-
hards.”

DeLaney also pointed out that
the Museum has claimed the en-
dorsement of scholars such as
himself and incoming-Harvard
President Drew Gilpin Faust. But
he disputes the idea that every
scholar to research at the museum
actually endorses it.

In his written statement, DeL-
aney said, “My own fear is that
the already tiny black profes-
sional community [in Lexington]
will vanish if the museum moves
to Lexington. The town will sim-
ply become whiter than it is now,
and the museum will be at home
in a community where there are
no strong black critics.”

It does seem to be the case that
the city of Lexington is interested

in the potential relocation of the
museum.

Sammy Moore, Executive
Director of the Lexington-Rock-
bridge Chamber of Commerce,
said that the president of the
Chamber’s board had written let-
ters to the museum as part of an
investigation into potential eco-
nomic beneﬁts for Lexington and
Rockbridge area businesses.

“If it proves to be an economic
beneﬁt then the chamber will pay
attention to it,” said Moore.

Jean Clark, the Executive Di-
rector of the Lexington-Rock-
bridge Area Tourism Bureau es-
timated visitors to the museum
could contribute as much as $600
per person to the local economy.

Rawls estimated that the Vir-
ginia Horse Center and Natural
Bridge combined bring in some
650,000 visitors a year to the
Lexington area. With a planned
2011 opening to coincide with the
150'“ anniversary of the start of
the Civil War, Rawls claims that

the museum could “get a lot more
visitors.”

Critics are skeptical the muse-
um will be a tourism boon though.
DeLaney points out that “nothing
important to the Civil War hap-
pened here” and that the location
of Jackson and Lee’s burial sites
in Lexington are the only real
connections Lexington has to the
Civil War.

DeLaney said the lack of an
easily accessible airport nearby
and the price of gas will likely
be large deterrents for Civil War
buffs, even if the museum relo-
cated to Lexington.

“There are two corpses here,”
said DeLaney.

In DeLaney’s opinion, the
museum’s move will have far less
economic impact than projected
and will potentially drive off the
black professional community in
Lexington.

“Richmond is a large city and
a Civil War site,” said DeLaney.

“The museum belongs there.”

  _ Lenfest discusses landmark gift

Advancement head Dennis Cross

says matching fundraising must be completed by December 2010

In addition to attracting fac-
ulty, Lenfest believes that the do-
nation will compensate the hard
work of current professors.

“Washington and Lee has re-
ally become one of the preemi-
nent liberal arts university’s in the
country, and we attribute that to
its faculty,” said Lenfest. “Teach-
ers have to get compensation that
matches their teaching excel-
lence.”

The gift must be matched by
December 31, 2010, for a ﬁnal
total of $66 million. Vice Presi-
dent for University Advancement
Dennis Cross said that the univer-
sity has already made strides in its
effort to raise money from alums,
parents, and friends.

“We’ll be talking to those
people, asking them to make gifts
to support the challenge grant,
which we’re calling the Lenfest

“Like most people who graduate from W&L,

the experience and what you learn there fol-

lows you throughout life. I’ve had the chance

GERRY LENFEST, Alumnus and former board member

Faculty Support Challenge En-
dowment,” said Cross. “A current
board member called last month
and said that he wanted to donate
$500,000 to the fund.”

The issue of faculty compen-
sation came up in a conversation
between Williams and Lenfest
during a breakfast meeting of the
Presidential Search Committee.
Cross, who is in charge of raising
private gifts for W&L, praised
Lenfest’s willingness to give to a

variety of causes.

“Mr. Lenfest is a sophisticated
donor with very wide interests,”
said Cross. “He is a true philan-
thropist.”

Lenfest has also contributed
to the construction of W&L’s per-
forming arts building, now called
Lenfest Center, as well as to Wil-
son Hall, the university’s art and
music building.

Since selling his cable televi-
sion company, Lenfest Commu-

nications, to COMCAST Corpo-
ration in January of 2001, he has
given to a number of other orga-
nizations including Mercersburg
Academy, Columbia Law School,
the Philadelphia Museum of Art,
the Curtis Institute of Music,
and many more. He also ﬁmded
a millennium village in Kenya,
a “bottom up” approach to help
developing countries get out of
poverty.

The new salaries will take ef-
fect during the 2008-2009 aca-
demic year, but increasing salaries
is not the only priority on W&L’s
agenda.

“Of course this is certainly not

ward.”

A new look at 21? New book

Former Middleibury president shares idea of a drinking license

By Sacha Raab
STAFF WRITER

Former President of Mid-
dlebury College and founder
of Choose Responsibility, Dr.
John M. McCardell, spoke to
the Washington and Lee corn-
munity on Tuesday, March 27”‘
about the beneﬁts of lowering
the drinking age from 21 to 18.

“Drinking age 21 is bad so-
cial policy and terrible law,”
said McCardell. “Parents and
institutions are marginalized
and underage drinking is worse
than it’s ever been.”

McCardell believes that the
legal drinking age of 21 denies
the fact that alcohol is a cul-
tural reality and that prohibition
doesn’t work. Prohibition, he
believes, merely results in eva-
sion of the law and the creation
of ethical dilemmas, meaning
drinking becoming more pro-
nounced and less visible.

Furthermore, McCardell
said, “The law puts before an
institution a set of impossible
choices: you either look the
other way and permit the law to
be violated, but ultimately corn-
municate that the law is unjust
and unfair and you can choose
which laws you follow, or you
take the stance that the law is
the law and you must crack

sion, and consumption of alcohol—I 8 year-olds

are considered adults in the United States. ”

vigorously.”

He said, however, that the
problem with more strictly en-
forcing the law is that it simply
“uproots and transplants the
problem to unregulated and un-
safe environments.”

According to McCardell,
lowering the drinking age will
make the situation more imper-
feet, yet it will bring the issue
out into the open and allow al-
cohol to be part of normal social
intercourse in the adult world.

He said, “In all instances
but one — the purchase, posses-
sion, and consumption of alco-
hol — l8—year—olds are consid-
ered adults in the United States.
Once we cease to infantilize
young adults in this respect, they
will no longer live down to our
expectations and will develop a
more mature view of alcohol.”

Additionally, alcohol is af-
fecting family relations in our
country. McCardell stated, “Le-
gal age [of] 21 is anti-family. It
displaces parents from the exer-

cise of one of the most impor-
tant parental duties of educating
their young adults in responsible
alcoholic consumption.”
During his time at Middle-
bury, McCardell witnessed the
social atmosphere when the
drinking age was 18 as opposed
to 21. He said, “The social
scene has changed dramatically.
With a legal age [of] 18, there
was more intergenerational so-
cializing in a more mature set-
ting. Adults didn’t feel like they
had to catch college students
breaking the law, and you hard-
ly heard of binge drinking.”
McCardell further supports
his argument with statistics the
alcohol related fatalities do not
directly correlate with the legal
age of 21 and that underage and
binge drinking are worse now
than they’ve ever been.
Students at W&L have been
drinking less in recent years, but
the school still annually exceeds
the national averages for binge
drinking and blackout drinking.

The school has had success,
however, in sharply reducing
the number of DU1s by students
on both the law and undergradu-
ate campuses.

However. the medical ﬁeld
continues to consider the dan-
ger of shifting the legal drink-
ing age back. The head doctor
of the W&L health center, Dr.
Jane Horton. said, “Lowering
the drinking age is worth con-
sidering, but there is valid sci-
ence that the later we can defer
exposure to alcohol, the fewer
individuals might have impaired
learning and addiction.”

She, too, strongly identiﬁes
with the ethical dilemma that
McCardell described, yet she
believes, “as an institution, we
cant be held hostage by and re-
sponsible for students making
high risk choices and breaking
the law. Our job should be to
educate.”

In response to a question con-
cerning her opinion of alcohol
on this campus, Dr. Horton re-
plied, “There is a lot of high risk
use of alcohol on this campus.
Every week 1 see students who
suffer the negative etfects of
overuse of alcohol. 1 know the
tell it takes on people’s physical
and personal health.”

Earlier this year W&L’s of-
ﬁce of Health Promotion invited
Chris and Toren Volkmann to
campus to speak about Toren°s
struggle with alcoholism.

McCardell”s program,
Choose Responsibility, proposes
to lower the legal drinking age
from 21 to 18 and accompany
the change in law with “a corn-
prehensivc program for young
adults that requires education
and licensing. offers personal
incentives for adherence. and
enforces responsible and ethical
adult behavior among all those
— regardless of age  who make
choices about drinking."

He recognizes that any
change in the law is far in the
future yet currently aims to start
a public discussion that is “in-
formed and dispassionate” to
consider whether the current
situation can be improved.

McCardell said, “I’ve felt
strongly about this for a very
long time. I believe this is an
issue to which students can re-
sponsibly devote their energy.”

Ba nerisms

Doris Bane hopes students will
share photos and stories for book

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

For nearly 20 years Thom-
as “Baner” Bane has been the
first person new W&L stu-
dents and their parents see
when they arrive for fresh-
man move—in day. Standing
in the middle of Washington
Street just short of the domrs,
Baner smoothly routes traffic
through the organized chaos,
helping befuddled freshmen
ﬁnd their way to the proper
dorms.

Baner is famous for more
than just his trafﬁc skills. He
has also jumped hundreds of
cars for students who have
left their lights on or are suf-
fering from mechanical trou-
bles. On a less popular note,
there are also the hundreds of
parking tickets he has writ-
ten and vehicles he has had
towed.

Now, after her husband’s
34 years with —W&L, Doris
Bane has decided write a
book about her husband. She
thinks that Baner stands as a
true example of the family at-
mosphere W&L prides itself
on. Thafs why Baner and his
W&L family will be the fo-
cus of the book.

“I’ve had a tremendous
response from alumni about
Baner. especially from his
time working in the gym’s
equipment room during the
tenure of Coach Fallon.”

Fallon was a legendary
W&L football coach who led
the team from 1978 until his
death in 1995. He has more
wins than any coach in W&L
history.

Alumni response has var-
ied from 5-page, hand-writ-
ten letters to a short para-
graph in an e-mail, but each
person seems to have a dif-

ferent story to share about her
husband.
Mrs. Bane has been

spending parts of the last
several weeks on campus,
meeting with students, fac-
ulty, staff and even President
Ruscio to gather their favor-
ite memories of Barter. She
is also hoping students will
send her photographs of Ba-
ner working at parties at the
Pole Houses, Windfall Hill or
Pink Palace.

Though she has received
some responses from current
students, Mrs. Bane hopes to
gather more of their stories
before spring break. She is
working with such a tight
schedule because of upcorn-
ing deadlines from the book‘s
publisher.

The book will mix recol-
lections from students, fac-
ulty and alumni with some
of Baner’s favorite stories
and his famous “Banerisms."
Part of the struggle has been
getting Barter himself to sit
down for interviews that will
go in the book. Between
working full-time with the
school, serving as a security
officer at parties and events,
and managing three farms
that he owns, Baner has more
than enough to keep him
busy.

The book is currently
scheduled for release this
fall, hopefully just before
W&L’s Parents’ Weekend.
Mrs. Bane hopes to hold a re-
lease event and book signing
that we ekend.

She can be reached at ba-
nerandi@.yahoo.corn. Photos
can be sent to 169 Bunker
Hill Mill Road in Lexington.

In the meantime, Baner
will continue writing tickets
and sharing his wisdom with
the W&L family.

Tolerance
is truly fear

Ruscios email encourages fear of
disagreement, disapproval instead
of demanding acceptance of others

I write in response to President
Ruscio’s recent message to the
W&L community. in which he en-
courages ‘a dialogue that speaks
to our fundamental commitments
to civility and tolerance’. Unless
we take civility to mean nothing
more than ‘being nice’, these two
fundamental commitments of
ours are in basic opposition. Ci-
vility implies civilisation, culture
and reﬁnement; tolerance makes
no distinction between what is
civilised and what is barbaric, be-
tween the reﬁned and the crude.

Our alleged commitment to
tolerance demands our respect,
acceptance and appreciation of
diverse ways of thinking and
living—even of those we might
consider destructive and contrary
to civility. Now, toleration of a
thing implies disapproval of it.
If my friend asserts an idea with
which I agree, I do not tolerate
it~I accept it, for I’m on his side.
But, if he says something I do not
like, I can either challenge it and
give my opinion or tolerate it and
keep quiet.

The latter option is intellec-
tual cowardice. It is a refusal to

afﬁrrn what one believes is right
and true, preferring to hide behind
a false neutrality to avoid having
to confront alternate points of
view. How fear of intellectual
disagreement and of intelligent
engagement can be considered
a fundamental commitment of a
university community is quite be-
yond me.

The latter is in-
tellectual cow-
ardice. It is a
refusal to aﬁirm
what one be-
lieves is right.

As a ﬁnal point, I, together
with President Ruscio, ‘abhor
acts of violence and aggression
toward others no matter the mo-
tivation’. Indeed, I am intolerant
of them.

A clean ‘O8 campaign

Presidential candidates might run out of mud to sling if this keeps up

By Abel Delgado
c o LU M u I sr

The 2008 General Election
Campaign for president might
turn out to be out to be one of the
cleanest and most ﬂawless gener-
al campaigns in recent memory.

After all the dirt the candidates
have thrown to others in their own
party and all the blunders they
have made to derail their own
campaign, there might not be any
mud left to sling or ways left to
mess up by the time the Demo-
crats and Republicans picks their
candidates.

To begin with, there’s the
campaign’s supposed golden boy,
Barrack Obama.

Normally, not having any con-
crete stands or experience would
not hinder a candidate this early.
But the other candidates have
began to pummel Obama on his
lack of experience. Do not think
the senator is going to take it ly-
ing down, though.

There_is already a shady link
between a campaign worker of
his and the man who created an
intemet attack ad comparing Hill-

How can a one-time cross-dresser be
leading the Republican polls? Well,
with this crowd, anything is possible.

ary Clinton, the only candidate
ahead of Obama in the Democrat-
ic polls, to an 1984ish Big Broth-
er type of leader. The commercial
is downright creative and might
hold some truth, so Obama loses
points for not taking credit.

Then there’s Republican Mitt
Romney who has taken a page
from the Democratic strategy
book and ﬂip-ﬂopped on every is-
sues from abortion to gay rights
to immigration.

Obviously trying to mimic the
vast success that John Kerry had
with the same strategy, Romney
has changed his stance depend-
ing on the crowd in front of him,
pandered to the “party base” and
attacked those, i.e. John McCain,
who have not done the same.

McCain is obviously letting
Rorrmey get to him since he now

says he’s reconsidering his once
staunch stance on immigration.

The former front-runner has
had to be on the defensive as of
late, being the most prominent
candidate to show support for the
new Bush plan in Iraq.

Back on the Democratic side,
there is John Edwards. While ev-
eryone has gained a new level of
respect for Edwards and his fam-
ily for continuing his campaign as
his wife bravely ﬁghts cancer, has
anyone else noticed the man has
become a socialist?

Edwards has plans for the
U.S., not the least of which in-
cludes universal health care and
more welfare that would leave the
country looking more European
than many Americans are ready
for.

Of course he’s not the only one

promising universal health care.

Senator Clinton, everyone’s
favorite candidate to hate, has
copied Edwards’ plan to thetee. It
might work better than her eight
year failure of health care reform
did as ﬁrst lady.

This might not be enough to.

convince the 44 percent of Amer-
icans that already have decided
not vote for her. If Clinton has
succeeded in anything, it’s unit-
ing mainstream America against
her.

She really has no reason to
campaign considering evcryone’s
opinion ofher, whether positive or
negative, is already set in stone.

That leaves the current front
runner, Rudy Giuliani.

How can a one-time cross
dresser be leading the Republican
polls? How can a man the liberals
of New York consider dictatorial
lead the national polls? Well with
this crowd, anything is possible.

Hopefully some positive in-
formation will come out of one
of these candidates soon. If not,
here’s to 19 more months of the
agonizing reality one of these
people will lead the free world.

Against all odds

Playing the lottery is a tax on stupid
people, winning not a walk in the park

By Jesslca Stelnmetz
c o LU M N I sr

Playing the lottery is just re-
ally stupid. That’s the only thing I
remember from my Pre-Calculus
class.

It has actually nothing to do
with Pre-Calc, which is quite
unfortunate since I am actually
taking Cale 101 right now. And,
yes, I am a junior...smart choice,
I know.

My high school math teacher
spent a whole class period ranting
about the lottery and mathemati-
cally proving the odds that lottery
players are up against.

I am sure Mr. Jungk would be
disappointed that I do not remem-
ber how to come up with these
numbers. I do, however, remem-
ber one thing: the odds are astro-
nomically against lottery players.

For instance, you have a better
chance of being struck by light-
ening or dying by eating ﬂesh-
eating bacteria than winning the
California State Lottery. Those
are clearly excellent odds.

It is three times more likely
for a person driving ten miles to
buy a Lotto ticket to be killed in
an accident than to actually win
the lottery.

Here’s another statistic for
you: if one person purchases 50
Lotto tickets each week, they will

win the jackpot about once every
5,000 years.

As Dave Barry, the humor
columnist says, “The lottery is a
tax on stupid people.” After all,
it seems foolish to waste money
when the odds are so against you.

People who play the lottery of-
ten say something along the lines
of, “It’s only a dollar and I can
win so much”.

But it is not only a dollar. Peo-
ple typically do not just buy one
lottery ticket in their life.

The average American spends
$184 on the lottery. And that is
just the average.

Then there is all the players
who have to make up for people
like me, who will never spend a
single cent on a lottery ticket, or
people who just play it once or
twice a year.

If you invested instead of
spending $10 a month on lottery
tickets over 40 years, the typi-
cal increased retirement savings
rather than playing the lottery
would be around $14,440. And
remember that $10 a month is less
than what the average American
spends.

While that might not seem like
a lot of money to some of you,
think of how much that money
could help a family that was not
well-off.

Or think about how much that

could help your favorite charity.

Of course there are the lucky
ones. I have never known anyone
who actually won the lottery but
it does happen.

Hitting the lottery is not ex-
actly picture-perfect.

Think of how many people
would hit you up for money.
When you just won all that “free”
money, it is hard to say “no” with-
out a ﬁght with at least one friend
or relative. ‘

By the time the government
takes a huge chunk out of money,
you ﬁnally give in to your broke
cousin Nina so she does not think
you are a complete selﬁsh witch
for turning her down.

Then you go on your increased
Christmas shopping spree so the
whole family does not think you
are a cheapskate, and you will be
nowhere near having enough to
quit your job and live the good
life.

But then I ﬁnally got to replace
my laptop that was literally fall-
ing apart when my Grandma won
big-time from the slot machines.
And she only put in a few dollars
before you won.

So if you really have to gam-
ble in some form or another, play
the slots.

The odds are at least better,
and it is more than a quick minute
of entertainment. right?

Hearing needs
press coverage

Active student press will let hearing be truly, open

Wednesday’s open hearing is an unusual
event. An open hearing has not occured in
over a decade.

The student press on campus has been
working this week with the Executive Com-
mittee to plan our coverage of the trial.

We believe that open press coverage is
the best way to truly inform all members
of the community about how the hearing
works and about what the jury eventually
decides.

Members of the Phi, Trident and A
Week in General will be working together
this week to cover the trial. The two news-
papers will publish a joint issue tomorrow
night that contains all the information you
will need to know about Wednesday’s trial.

It is important to remember, however,
that all members of these news organiza-
tions are students as well as journalists.
Journalists on this campus must learn to
abide by this system while at the same time
covering its actions.

We hold the White Book in the highest
respect and are concerned ﬁrst and foremost
about allowing the accused student to have
a fair hearing on his/her case. Therefore, we
will withhold the student’s name during our

coverage.

Many of you may wonder why the trial
needs to be covered. Aﬁer all, it is open to
all current members of the W&L commu-
nity.

But because Lee Chapel only holds
525 members, approximately 25 percent
of our students can attend the trial at any
given time. That calculation does not even
consider faculty and staff who may wish to
watch our honor system at work.

Our press coverage will greatly beneﬁt
people who are unable to attend.

Above all, our goal is to educate the
community on the procedures of the hear-
ing as well as the past history of open hear-
ings. We are not there to serve as court
reporters.

Our campus speaks constantly about the
trust we have in each other, and an open
hearing is the ultimate example of that
trust.

That trust is what is allowing the student
press to work with trial chairman Adam
Hull and EC President Rob Rain.

Through our coverage of this event, we
will uphold the trust placed in us.

Self-interest swells in US

Study indicates that narcissism is becoming a trend among college students across the nation

By Queenle Wong
STAFF WRITER

University President Ken
Ruscio remains optimistic about
the evolution of Washington and
Lee’s campus culture despite a
national study that found a rise in
narcissism and self-centeredness
among today’s college students.

“I look at the students in the
seventies and I see where they are
now, and with great regularity,
they tend to be people that are not
just involved in their business...
they tend to be active and en-
gaged individuals, and I don’t see
any reason to think that the cur-
rent generation will display a dif-
ferent pattern,” said Ruscio, who
graduated from W&L in 1976.

The study, according to the
press release, analyzed the re-
sponses of 16,475 college students
throughout the United States, who
ﬁlled out the Narcissistic Person-
ality Inventory between 1982 and
2006. Lead author of the report,
San Diego State University As-
sociate Professor Jean Twenge,
presented the study along with
her colleagues at the SDSU gen-
eration gap workshop Feb. 27.

The NPI asks students to re-
spond to statements such as: “If
I ruled the world, it would be a
better place,” “I can live my life
anyway I want to” and “I like to
be the center of attention.”

The study found that almost
two-thirds of today’s college stu-
dents had narcissism scores that

“I think that one way that [students] can check

themselves is to really develop a sense of being

okay based on your own standard ”

CHRISTY BARONGAN, unlverslty counsellng psychologist
 

were above the average 1982
score. Thirty percent more col-
lege students showed elevated
narcissism in 2006 than in 1982
and the average college student
scored nearly as high on narcis-
sism as the average celebrity.

According to the press release,
it is the largest study ever con-
ducted on generational changes
in narcissism. The report is still
under review for publication in a
scholarly journal.

Ruscio, who acknowledged the
ﬁndings, said that although W&L
students tend to be very self-as-
sured and conﬁdent in their lead-
ership and intellectual abilities,
he wouldn’t characterize them as
narcissistic. He believes that stu-
dents on this campus would score
lower on the NPI than on other
campuses.

President Ruscio also said that
the university historically attracts
students devoted to community
service and volunteer work.

According to the Cooperative
Institutional Research Program’s
(CIRP) Freshman Survey, W&L
freshmen have shown about a
13 percent increase in volunteer

work since 1985.

The latest survey, taken this
fall, shows that about 90 percent
of freshmen performed volunteer
work occasionally or frequently
in the last year. This time the per-
centage was slightly above the
national average by about ﬁve
percent.

But another alumnus, Profes-
sor and Head of the University’s
Journalism Department Brian
Richardson, does see a change in
W&L’s student culture.

“At W&L, I see more of a
sense of entitlement among stu-
dents,” he said. “It’s not among
all students. I wouldn’t even say
it’s among most students, but it’s
more prevalent than it used to
be.”

Richardson, who graduated
from the university in 1973, said
that he doesn’t believe students
are more self-centered by nature,
but rather that their parents are in-
dulging this behavior more often.
As a result, this leaves the impres-
sion that students don’t have to
take responsibility for their own
actions.

Yet Richardson also thinks

that W&L’s students are more
involved in local community ser-
vice than their predecessors. Back
in the 1970s, due to the war, many
students were involved globally
rather than locally, he said.

Perhaps the major diﬁerence
between W&L’s current and past
generation is the use of technol-
ogy, which Twenge believes fuels
the trend of narcissism. Ruscio
and Richardson agreed.

“It cuts across the grain of our
campus culture,” said Ruscio, who
worries about the “gravitational
pull” away from the university’s
fundamental traditions.

It’s no longer uncommon for
students to walk around cam-
pus with their cell phones. This
makes it difficult to practice the
university’s speaking tradition,
said Richardson.

Despite technology’s negative
effects on the current generation,
University Counseling Psychia-
trist Kirk Luder said that students
usually use websites such as
Facebook and MySpace to make
connections rather than isolate
themselves.

Luder believes that the fact
that most students on campus
come from intact families, who
value educational achievement,
also makes it less likely that
W&L would score high on the
NPI. Compared to other institu-
tions he’s worked for, Luder be-
lieves that narcissism is actually
lower on this campus.

mitting there is some truth in the
ﬁndings, ’doesn’t necessarily ac-
cept this stereotype either.

Senior Anthony Zappin said
that the campus atmosphere has
mostly stayed the same in the last
four years, but that this isn’t re-
ally a “bad thing.” _

“I guess at W&L there’s not
a lot of diversity, but at the same
time the group of people here are
very well-mannered,” he said.

But for those who experience
narcissism and self-centeredness,
there are negative consequences.

University Counseling Psy-
chologist Maria “Christy” Bar-
ongan said that to some degree
students need to feel good about
themselves, however, “unhealthy
narcissism” creates an inﬂated
sense of self, which substitutes
for self-esteem. Narcissists tend
to rely on external factors to feel
good about themselves and are in
constant need of praise, she said.

“I think that one way that
[students] can check themselves
is to really develop a sense of
being okay based on your own
standar ,” said Barongan. “What
other people think about you may
ﬂuctuate, but if you have a sense
of yourself that remains constant,
I think that’s going to be the thing
that prevents people from going
overboard.”

The nationally ranked
men’s tennis team wrapped
up a successful two week
stretch this weekend

by knocking off No. 26
Swarthmore 5-4 yesterday
in Lexington. Jon Malooly,
Seth Feibelman and Stuart
Sanford got wins at third,
fourth, and sixth singles,
respectively, and the No.
17 Generals also got two
doubles wins. Sanford and
F eibehnan grabbed an 8-2
victory at No. 3 doubles
while Tim Ross and Nat
Estes avenged defeats in
singles by defeating their
opponents 8-4 in the top
doubles spot. The men
also grabbed a 9-0 sweep
on Saturday when they
defeated Christopher New-
port in Lexington. The
third match of the weekend
was a 6-3 victory over
Rhodes College on Friday
afternoon. The defeat was
only the second of the year
for Rhodes. W&L swept
doubles play in that match
and added wins at second,
third, and fourth singles
from Estes, Malooly and
Feibelman. W&L suffered
only its second loss of the
season a week ago Satur-
day when they dropped a
5-4 decision against .Mary
Washington, the No. 9 team
in the country. Wins from
Ross and Estes at number
one doubles and from Ross,
Malooly and Feibelman in
singles left the team just
one point short of victory.

Track takes on D-

Men is and women is teams record 10
D-III ﬁrst place ﬁnishes at AS] CS
Invitational over the weekend

By Russ Weoms
STAFF WRITER

Over the past two weeks,
the W&L track team has faced
some stout competition but has
fared well. Both of their last two
meets included NCAA Division I
teams.

Last Saturday the Generals
participated in the Fred Hardy In-
vitational. The meet consisted of
Division I teams and scored indi-
vidually only.

Despite the tough competi-
tion, W&L had some strong per-
fonnances.

On the women's side, sopho-
more Elizabeth Webb ﬁnished
ninth in the 800 meters with a
time of 2:21.03. Sophomore Bec-
ca Taylor took 11"‘ in the 1500
meters with a time of 4:53.83.

Freshman Sallie Armstrong
notched a 20"‘ place ﬁnish 400
meter hurdles with a time of
70.33 while sophomore Stepha-
nie Stelter followed right behind
her with a time of 71.70 to earn
21st place. _

In the men’s meet, junior Steve
Rivoir, sophomores Robbie Vari-
papa and Alex Jackson, and fresh-
man Rob Saliers placed third in a
time of 8: 19.53 in the 4x800 relay.
Sophomore Chip McCoy ﬁnished
23"’ in the 400 meter hurdles with
atime of 61.86.

Freshman Billy Billington
competed at the Bridgewater In-
vitational in Bridgewater, Va. He
ﬁnished second in two events,
with a 45-foot shot put throw and
a heave of 131 feet in the discus.

This Saturday W&L competed
in the Asics Invitational at Liberty
University. The meet included
Division I, Division II, and Divi-
sion III teams.

Against the Division III teams,
W&L fared well, accumulating
10 ﬁrst-place ﬁnishes.

For the men, freshman Ben
Goetsch tied for ﬁrst overall in
the high jump with an impressive
high jump of 6’00.75.” Freshman
Ryan Castle’s 38’l0.25 triple
jump was ﬁrst among Division
III competitors. Sophomore Chip
McCoy took ﬁrst in Division III
in the 400 meter hurdles with a
time of 59.96.

The women had an impressive
showing, with seven competitors
placing ﬁrst in Division III.

Webb took ﬁrst among Divi-
sion III runners in the 1500 me-
ters in a stellar school-record time
of 4:49.00.

Stelter took ﬁrst among D-III
competitors in the 400 meter hur-
dles with a time of 71.42. Fresh-
man Lizz Krausnick ﬁnished ﬁrst
among D-III runners in the 800
meters with a time of 2:24.82.
Taylor put up atime of 18:38.90 in

the 5000 meters which was good
enough for ﬁrst in Division III.
Junior pole vaulter Liz Brandler
placed ﬁrst out of D-III competi-
tors with an 8’ll.75” effort.

One highlight of the weekend
was Armstrong competing in the
heptathlon. '

i The heptathlon is a two-day

event which consists of the 100m
hurdles, high jump, shot put, and
200m run on the ﬁrst day and the
long jump, javelin, and 800m run
on the second day.

Armstrong scored 3,175 points
to establish a new school record.

The Generals next meet is over
the break on Saturday, April 14 at

the Coastal Carolina Invitational
in Conway, S.C at 9 a.m.

The team is looking forward to
doing very well at this meet.

“We think with two weeks to
prepare we can really show what
we can do and set a lot of per-
sonal records at this meet,” said
Saliers.

Womerfs tennis beats J MU

Team defeats nationally ranked Trinity and Pomona—Pitzer in pair of 9-0 matches ’

By Mlchael Keenan
STIFF WRITER

The women’s tennis team ran
its record to 10-0 on the season
after defeating Division I James
Madison University 5-4 on March
21 in Harrisonburg, VA.

“They’re a Division I team,
and we don’t get to play D-I
teams very oﬁen,” said Katie
Tabb. ‘‘If we can compete against
a D-I program, that really says
something about our level at the
D-III level.”

In the doubles portion of the
competition, JMU took two of
three matches to take a 2-1 lead.
The Dukes team of Rebecca Er-
ickson and Briana Jain defeated
Leah Weston and Ginny Wortham
8-5 and Lauren Graham and Kelly
Maxwell defeated W&L’s Lauren
Caire and Kelly Will by the same
score.

The General’s lone victory in
the doubles matches came when
Emily Applegate and Tabb de-
feated JMU’s duo of Anna Khoor
and Mary Napier.

Applegate and Tabb continued
where they left off by winning the
No. 1 and No. 2 singles matches
against Napier and Khoon Apple-
gate won in three sets 6-3, 3-6, 6-
3, while Tabb won in straight sets
6-1, 6-3.

JMU’s Jain and Maxwell both
won in straight sets over Will and
Caire, but victories by Wortham’s
and Weston’s victories secured
the 5-4 win for the Generals.

Before heading off to Texas
for the Fab Five Tournament, the
women recorded a pair of 9-0 vic-
tories against conference oppo-
nents Randolph-Macon Woman’s
College on March 22 and Virginia
Wesleyan on March 24.

The Generals only dropped
one game in the match against
Randy-Mac and did not drop a set

in either match.

The Fab Five tournament got
off to a rainy start and W&L’s ﬁrst
match against Pomona—Pitzer,
which was scheduled for Friday,
was postponed until Saturday.

The delay didn’t slow down
the Generals as they cruised to a
9-0 victory.

The doubles teams of Ap-
plegate and Tabb, Weston and
Wortham and Kristen McClung
and Will recorded victories.

In the singles matches, Apple-
gate defeated Pomona-Pitzer’s
Siobhan Finicane 4-6, 6-2, 10-8.
W&L would sweep the ﬁve re-
maining matches without drop-
ping another set.

Later on Saturday, the No. 1-
ranked Generals took on No. 5
Williams, with a much different
result.

The Ephs got off to a strong
start by winning No. l and No. 2
doubles.

W&L’s duo of McClung and
Caire won No. 3 doubles, defeat-
ing Geni Loomis and Ashley Par-
sons 8-6.

In the singles competition,
Applegate, Will, and McClung
recorded victories to split the sin-
gles matches 3-3, but it was not
enough as Williams handed the
Generals their ﬁrst defeat of the
season, 5-4.

The women rebounded by-

wrapping up the tournament on
Sunday with a 9-0 thrashing of
hosts Trinity University to run
their record to 14-1.

The Generals will conclude
regular season play with four
matches over spring break.

The team will look to wrap up
another undefeated conference
season before heading to Atlanta
for a match at Emory University
Tuesday, April 17. That will be

a rematch of last year’s national
championship match. .
The ﬁnal regular season match
will be the next day at Sewanee.
If, as expected, the Generals
romp through the ODAC t0uma-
ment and take the title during the
ﬁnal weekend of spring break,
they will then turn their attention
to the NCAA team and individual
championships in May at Mary
Washington in Fredericksburg.

Why you
should be  
excited

‘ Lewis explains
- why now is the

time to be a fan

By Adam Lewls
COLUMNIST

Despite everything negative
that surrounds modem-day sports,
this time of year makes me ex-
tremely proud to be a sports fan.

Your 2:30 Economics class where
vantage, or the buzzer-beater that

next round in the NCAA touma—
ment? Screw comparative, that’s

I mean, which is more inter-

ing Tiger ﬁgure out the slope of
the green on Sunday at the Mas-

give you the derivative, it gives
you a green jacket.

Personally, I can’t think of any
other time in the sports calendar
where I am happier.

First, we have March Mad-
ness. Now I know people say that
there are only two sure things in
the world: death and taxes. But
an exciting March Madness tour-

to that list. Though this touma-
ment started off with only a few
really exciting ﬁrst round games,
it picked up with each round. For
the ﬁrst time ever, all four no. 1
seeds and three no. 2 seeds made
the Elite Eight. I don’t think I
have ever seen more intensity, de-
termination or goofy scrubs lock-
ing arms on the bench thinking
that they make a difference.

April 1 marked the Opening
Day of Major League Baseball,
a day that has an aura surround-
ing it which always seems to take
America from winter to spring.
And, beautiful weather combined
with the smell of hot dogs and
beer can only mean one thing: I’m
going to have to stash the beer to
avoid getting a strike, and then go
watch baseball.

Moving on, the Masters be-
gins this week. No other event
boasts the best players in the
world playing on the most aes-
thetically pleasing course in the
world, without the interference
of commercials and women (just
kidding). But in all seriousness,
I can’t think of many other week-
ends that are more enjoyable than
the Masters. Where else do fat
guys have a decent change of
winning a sports competition?

Next we have the NHL play-
offs, which begin on April 11.
For those of you who may be un-
interested, let me assure you that
the Stanley Cup playoffs are actu-
ally quite entertaining. Any true
sports fan can appreciate fast-
moving, hard-hitting play, espe-
cially when arrest-worthy ﬁghts
are allowed to occur.

Overlapping with the Stanley
Cup playoffs is the post-season
of the NBA. Personally, I have
very little to say about profes-
sional basketball nowadays, but
the playoffs tend to encourage
players to actually play defense,
which is always fun.

Lastly, the weekend of April
28 marks the culmination of the
greatest period on the sports cal-
endar with the NFL draft. Like
when the Jetson’s met the Fline-
stones’, the NFL draft sees two
great organizations meet on the
same stage. And, if you thought
predicting how Fred would react
when he saw George was diffi-
cult, try predicting who the Raid-
ers will select in the ﬁrst round.

There you have it: my favorite
time of year. The time when the
only city you should be studying
is “Upset City, baby!”

Men sweep ODAC foes

Loss against Shenandoah is only blemish during season 3* busiest week '

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

Senior Clayton Edwards tossed

a complete-game in game one and
Junior James Madden led an of-
fensive onslaught in game two as
the Generals swept

score Roanoke College

on Saturday and
W&L 3v 11 improved their con-
RC 1’ 5 ference record to a

lofty 10-3 mark.

This week was
a busy one for Washington and
Lee. Sunday’s non-conference
match against St. Mary’s was can-
celled, but the team still played
three conference games and one
non-conference game, winning
the three ODAC bouts and losing
to Shenandoah in the non-confer-
ence showing.

The Generals beat the Maroon
3-1 and 11-6 to go along with
Tuesday’s 7-4 win to avenge an
earlier ODAC loss to Bridgewa-
ter College. The sole blemish
on the week was the 10-4 loss to
Shenandoah.

With only ﬁve conference
games left to play, a group of ex-
perienced veterans and talented

youngsters have the Generals
poised for a showdown April 14
with Hampden-Sydney that will
go a long way towards determin-
ing who joins defending champi-
on Virginia Wesleyan at the top of
the conference standings.

Saturday’s doubleheader was
an excellent example of the di-
verse ways this team can win a
baseball game.

Edwards, the team’s undis-
puted ace, gave up an early run
before settling down, allowing
just four hits and the one run over
seven innings. The outing im-
proved his record on the mound
to 5-1 and dropped his ERA to a
sparkling 3.05.

In the meantime, junior out-
ﬁelders Madden and Tim Livings-
ton put W&L back in front with
RBI singles in the second inning.
Senior Catcher Jordan Wesley
who left Tuesday’s game after
tweaking an earlier hamstring
injury, returned to the lineup and
added some insurance with a
home run in the sixth.

The second game was anything
but a pitching duel, as the Gener-
als quickly fell behind the Ma-
roon. Junior John Parker strug-

gled from the outset. Though he
was able to escape a bases-loaded
jam in the ﬁrst, Roanoke struck
hard in the second, scoring ﬁve
runs on six hits. Brennan Thacker
delivered the biggest blow with a
bases-loaded double that brought
three men home.

Parker gave way to sopho-
more Brendan Clark, who pitched
four dominating innings, allow-
ing just two hits and no runs. He
got the win on the afternoon and
improved to 2-0 on the season.
While Clark was silencing Roa-
noke, W&L was getting its own
offense going against Maroon
starter Chase Davidson.

Madden provided the cru-
cial blow of the inning when he
launched a bases-loaded grand
slam. After Madden’s slam, a
double by sophomore Terrence
McKelvey and a single by fresh-
man catcher Will Lewis brought
three more runs to the plate and
put W&L on top for good.

The Generals padded their
lead in the ﬁfth and seventh in-
nings, scoring a pair of runs in
each frame. Livingston brought
home Madden and Edwards with
a single in the ﬁfth, and RBI

singles by Livingston and David
Miller scored runs in the seventh.

Madden ﬁnished the second
game 3-5, needing only a double
to complete the cycle. The of-
fensive outburst during the two
games bumped his batting av-
erage up nearly 30 points and
showed that he may be breaking
out of the mid-season slump he
struggled through during the past
few weeks.

Shenandoah simply dominat-
ed W&L on Thursday, piling up
10 runs against Livingston and
starter Steve Marcott. Shenando-
ah got four un-earned off Marcott
in the third before driving in three
runs in both the ﬁfth and sixth
against Livingston, who has spent
far more time in left ﬁeld than on
the mound this season.

Though Marcott took the loss
and fell to 3-2 on the year, his
ERA dropped to an astonishing
1.73. He has ﬁrmly established
himself as the team’s mid-week
starter.

Golfers look to drop shots '

James wins Lejeune title with two birdies in sudden-death playoff

By Brian Devlne
smrr wmrsn

The Oleander Course at Jekyll
Island Golf Club can be a tricky
opponent. Situated among the
pine trees and lakes of the his-

toric resort off the

Scores Georgia coast, the
James _8 course’s high winds

and challenging de-
Leisman +4 sign has tested golf-

ers since 1963.

On the weekend
of March 23-25, the Washington
and Lee golf team became the
latest to be tamed by Oleander,
ﬁnishing tied for 11”‘ out of 24
teams at the Jekyll Island Inter-
collegiate.

Though this is the ﬁrst time the
team has ﬁnished outside the top
ﬁve of a tournament this year, it
is not a terribly disappointing re-
sult. The Generals placed in the
top half of a ﬁeld including an-
nual D-III title contenders Meth-
odist, Averett and Oglethorpe.
At Jekyll Island the Generals ﬁn-
ished ahead of Averett, the 2003
national champions, and local
rivals Bridgewater, Roanoke and
Hampden-Sydney.

W&L’s ﬁve participants shot
a combined 303, their best round,

on the ﬁnal day to move into a
tie for eleventh place with St.
John Fisher and DePauw, both
of whom led the Generals after
Saturday’s second round. The
Generals ﬁnished with a com-
bined three-round score of 922,
only 14 strokes out of another top
ﬁve ﬁnish.

The compression at the top of
the team leaderboard was remark-
able. Only 25 strokes separated
Illinois Wesleyan and Hampden-
Sydney, who ﬁnished ﬁfth and
nineteenth, respectively. Golfers
struggled with the strong Atlantic
breeze and dogleg-ﬁlled course,
especially during Saturday’s sec-
ond round, where the Generals
carded a combined 311.

The Generals’ ﬁve representa-
tives were led by junior Nathaniel
James, who shot a ﬁrst round 70
(2 under par) and ﬁnished with
220, tied for tenth after the tour-
nament. Seniors Anthony Zap-
pin (231, tied for 47“‘) and Matt
Leisman (233, tied for 55“‘) also
ﬁnished in the top half of the lea-
derboard. Sophomore Beau Al-
len recorded a 238, and freshman
Kevin Trempe, making his varsity
tournament debut, shot a 243 on
the weekend.

James’ 220 helped him win

ODAC player of the week for
golf. A Third Team All—Ameri-
can last season and the reigning
ODAC Golfer of the Year, the
junior from suburban Dallas-Fort
Worth was instrumental in the
Generals’ top-half performance in
Georgia. James is averaging 74.6
strokes per round this season, best
on his team.

Despite James’ efforts and the
overall solid play of the W&L
outﬁt, the tournament was won
by Methodist University, who
won nine national championships
in ten years from 1990 to 1999.
The Monarchs beat out Ogletho-
rpe by eight strokes and were led
by senior Nick Bova. All ﬁve of
Methodist’s golfers ﬁnished in
the top 35. It is little surprise that
the Monarchs are a unanimous
pick for number one in the World
Golf Association Coaches’ Poll
for Division III. After dispatching
the ﬁeld so handily this weekend,
it seems a strong possibility that
Methodist will win its eleventh
championship this year.

Oglethorpe’s Taylor Urbanski
shot a third-round 70 to ultimate-
ly clip Bova for the individual
championship by a single stroke.
Urbanski and Bova were the only
two players to ﬁnish under par

over three rounds.

This weekend, the golf team
took part in the Marine Federal
Credit Union Intercollegiate at
Camp Lejeune, N.C. James, Leis-
man, Zappin, Joe Gibson and
Brad Watts competed for Gener-
als. On the ﬁrst day, James led the
way shooting a ﬁve-under-par 65
to lead the team to an eighth place
ﬁnish after day one. Zappin was
also under par, shooting a 68.

On day two, James led the way
again shooting a 69 on the par-72
gold course giving him a two day
total of 134, good enough for sec-
ond place. Leisman’s 71 was good
for one-under-par.

On day three, James again led
the way shooting a 72 which tied
him for ﬁrst place overall. In the
playoﬁ‘, he birded two holes in a
row to win the title. ‘

“It was quite a way to win,” he
said.

Overall, the Generals shot
305 on day three to ﬁnish with a
score of 879, good enough for 12”‘
place.

“It wasn’t a bad showing but
it wasn’t quite what we were ex-
pecting,” said James.

The Generals continue their
season on April l6 at the W&L
Buck Leslie Invitational.

New athletic center

Football stadium renovations put on hold for ﬁeld house contruction

By Michael Keenan
sponrs EDITOR

In a stunning change of plans,
the Washington and Lee Athletics
Department has announced that
they will postpone the rebuilding
of Wilson Stadium and instead
construct a ﬁeld house.

The ﬁeld house will beneﬁt
the entire student population and
be useful to all athletic teams on
campus. The proposed ﬁeld house
would contain an indoor track,
new pool, and a variety of other
facilities.

When asked about the change
in plans, a source speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said, “We
realized that football wasn’t the
only team that had a good season
this year. The men’s swim team
has won four consecutive Blue-
grass Mountain Conference titles

- — a conference which included Di-

vision II and NAIA teams — and
sent seven swimmers to nationals
where they placed 8*. The cross
country teams have won the past
three ODAC titles with the track
program on the rise and yet dur-
ing the indoor season they have to
walk to VMI’s outdated track just
to practice. The new ﬁeld house
will serve a wider selection of
students and show W&L strives
to recognize all athletic teams, not
just football.”

The new facility will allow
the swimming and track teams to
host conference championships
on campus. Last year, the ODAC
indoor championships were tech-
nically hosted by W&L, but be-
cause there was no facility on
campus, the championship meet
was held at Liberty University.

The new pool will be Olym-
pic-sized which will allow the
entire team to practice at the same
time withoutbeing overcrowded.

Track coaches Nathan Hoey and Brandon Uhl celebrate the announcement of the
new field house. Hoey and Ulh were also excited about their new sweater vests.

Additionally, the pool will
have a diving well so the swim
teams can expand to once again
being a swimming and diving
team.

“As great as our eighth place
ﬁnish was a nationals, it’s disap-
pointing to know that there’s two
more diving events we couldibe
earning points in but can’t be-
cause we don’t have the facili-
ties,” said one swimmer.

The track team’s pole vaulters
and throwers were also excited
about the news.

“Finally our practices won’t
be dependent on the weather,”
said one pole vaulter. “lt’s nice
to know the administration cares

about our improvement and safe-
ty.”
“It will be great not to have to
ﬁght with the Fancy Dress deco-
rations committee for practice
space,” said an excited thrower.

While training for the indoor
season, the throwershad to train
in the pavilion, which was also
used by the decorations commit-
tee.

The training facilities would
provide a backup practice area for
W&L’s many athletic teams. Pri-
ority would be given to in-season
sports so they would not have to
miss practice due to poor weather
conditions but out-of-season var-
sity sports, club team, and intra-

mural leagues would also beneﬁt.

“It will be much easier to
schedule intramurals with the ad-
ditional facilities,” said a source
inside. the intramural department.
“While it’s understandable that
varsity sports have ﬁrst priority,
it’s hard having to reschedule, es-
pecially during playoffs.”

Additionally, the ﬁeld house
would provide an alternate site
for graduation in case of inclem-
ent weather so seniors could grad-
uate at W&L rather than having to
go to VMI.

Construction is expected to
begin in May and be completed
by January, 2008. Bidding for
naming rights is still in progress.

First open hearing in twelve years ends with cheers,
screams and hugs when jury clears student of charges

By Nlna Coolidge and
Jacob Gelger

TRIDENT C0—EDlTOR-|N—CH|EF
AND PHI MANAGING EDITOR

Lee Chapel exploded with
cheers yesterday at 8:15 p.m.
when Open Hearing Chairman
Adam Hull said “not guilty.”

Those words were preced-
ed by a nine-hour hearing and
less than two hours of delib-
eration by the jury of 12 stu-
dents. When the chapel bells
began ringing at 7:44 p.m.,
students raced back towards
the chapel to hear the verdict
of Washington and Lee’s ﬁrst
open hearing in 12 years.

As students in the chapel
stood and cheered, the accused
hugged the honor advocates
who had worked so hard to
present the case. As students
poured out of the chapel after
the verdict, most of those pres-
ent seemcd pleased with the

outcome.

“It makes me have more
faith in the W&L student body
that they can listen to all the
facts and come out with a fair
verdict," junior Colette Mo-
ryan said.

One of the honor advocates
for the accused agreed.

“I think the hearing ran
great," said law representative
Jane Ledlie.

Students ﬂocked into Lee
Chapel and the Commons
theater throughout the day to
watch Executive Committee
advocates and honor advo-
cates for the accused deliver
opening statements, question
witnesses and ﬁnally deliver
closing statements.

Ledlie, a second-year law
student. and Josh Humphries
spoke for the accused.
Humphries is currently the
head honor advocate. Ledlie
is the incoming EC Secretary.

“I think Adam Hull did a great job, I think
the honor advocates did a great job and I
think the EC reps did a great job. I think this
was a good opportunity for the student body

to get to have a say in the honor system. ”

ROB RAIN, Executlve Commlttee President
 

Josh Payne, Oleg Nudel-
man and Jordan Campbell rep-
resented the EC. Payne will
become the new EC President
later this month.

“I’m was very pleased with
the way the [hearing] worked,”
EC President Rob Rain said.
“I think Adam Hull did a great
job, I think the honor advo-
cates did a greatjob and Ithink
the EC reps did a greatjob. I
think this was a good oppor-
tunity for the student body to

get to have a say in the honor
system.”

Rain recused himself from
the closed hearing and from
the open hearing, so he spent
the day handling logistical
details with Sergeant-at-Arms
Quiana McKenzie.

The main floor of the chapel
was mostly full when Hull, the
president of the Student Bar
Association, brought down his
gavel and called the session to
order shortly after 9 a.m.

Hull began the hearing by
laying out the ground rules for
the chapel. Members of the
community were ordered to
remain silent at all times and
only allowed to enter or exit
between witnesses.

The parents of the accused
arrived around 8:30 a.m. and
watched the hearing from the
balcony in the rear of the cha-
pel. During the hearing they
occasionally showed hints of
nervousness, as the father of
the accused would occasion-
ally drum his ﬁngers on the
pew or sit with his chin on
his hand. At other breaks he
would pace around the balco-
ny. Mostly, however, the two
sat impassively, listening to
the testimony from both sides.

When the verdict was an-
nounced, the parents both re-
acted joyously, clapping and
waving as the crowd below
cheered.

Since the last open hear-
ing occurred in March 1995,
McKenzie found herself With-
out much guidance while she
organized the hearing.

“It was a little stressful be-
cause there aren’t any real di-
rections for it,” she said. “You
just know you have to make it
happen.”

Student interest remained
high throughout the day as
waves of students moved in
and out of Lee Chapel and
Commons theater during the
entire hearing. Attendance at
both locations peaked around
I p.m.

At times the crowd was ex-
tremely engaged, leaning for-
ward in their seats and silently
listening to testimony. During
other parts of the proceedings,
however, the crowd’s attention
seemed to fade.

/ltmosphere in Elrod Commons theater is much more
relaxed as students come and go during the hearing

By Catherlne Carlock
C 0 FY E D ITO R

While students in Lee Chapel were
dressed to the nines in dresses and ties,
students in the Elrod Commons Stack-
house Theater enjoyed the luxury of
not having to dress up to view yester-
day’s open hearing.

A live streaming video of the pro-
ceedings was shown in the Commons
theater from 9:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.,
when the South Indian Classical Mu-
sic Performance “Jayanthi” took over
the stage. The open hearing broadcast
would have returned at 10:00 p.m., but
a verdict was announced at 8:15 p.m.

Palpable differences emerged
quickly between the proceedings in
the straight-backed pews of Lee Cha-
pel and the comfortable movie theater
chairs of the Commons.

Students in Lee Chapel were en-
couraged, sometimes even ordered,
to remain silent. Any noise from the
crowd could possibly sway or affect
the eventual decision from l2-mem-

ber jury.

Open Hearing Chairman Adam
Hull sometimes asked students to re-
main quiet while during writing breaks
for the jurors, but that prohibition cer-
tainly did not extend to the Commons
theater.

Those who attended the viewing
in the Commons “didn’t really know
what to expect,” said junior Blair Mc-
Cartney.

With its straight-backed pews,
original portraits of our founders and
Lee’s sarcophagus, Lee Chapel had a
naturally intimidating interior. The
broadcast e-mail sent to the W&L
community asked that members of that
community act in “a quiet and profes-
sional manner.”

According to freshman Erin Gal-
liher, however, the proceedings were
a “little more light-hearted” than she
originally expected.

“People started treating it more like
entertainment rather than a serious
proceeding to determine a student’s
future,” Galliher said.

“There were deﬁnitely periods
where there was a lot of laughter.”

After the proceedings began to get
underway, however, “people started
getting bored.”

Students in the Commons, how-
ever, were far removed from the actual
Lee Chapel proceedings and thus, far
removed from its serious nature.

“People were able to express their
thoughts,” said McCartney. “Every-
one was able to react.”

While those in Lee Chapel were
expected to remain quiet with nothing
but Washington and Lee identiﬁcation
in their hands, students and faculty
in the Stackhouse Theater could talk,
laugh, eat and drink.

The Stackhouse Theater also had
a higher daily traffic ﬂow outside its
doors. Backpacks and purses were
piled outside the doors of the theater.

The theater is located outside the
freshman dining hall, directly below
the Commons living room and right in
the path from the sorority bridge to the
main part of campus.

Broadcasting the hearing in such a
heavily trafﬁcked area made it much
easier for students to duck in between
classes or aﬁer lunch.

The fact that students did not have
to dress in Lee Chapel attire to view
the hearing in the Stackhouse Theater
was another key component to the
broadcast’s success. Many students
just didn’t feel like wearing a dress or
a coat and tie.

However, some students in the the-
ater were still wearing their Lee Cha-
pel clothes.

Students found it easier to respond
to a particularly hostile witness or a
particularly amusing comment in the
Commons than in the Chapel. With-
out the jury present to inﬂuence, those
in the Commons could behave in a
way very dissimilar to the behavior of
those in Lee Chapel.

Sophomore Carson Bruno felt that
the general atmosphere was “much
more serious in the Chapel,” but that it
“still convey[ed] theiseriousness of an
honor violation.”

Letter from
the editors

The open hearing yesterday
was undoubtedly one of the most
important things students will ex-
perience during their four years
here at W&L. It gave everyone in
the community a chance to see the
Honor System at work and reaf-
ﬁrmed for many their belief in the
student-run system.

It was also an important day
for the news outlets on campus. It
was the ﬁrst time we were allowed
to provide any type of signiﬁcant
coverage of an open hearing and
report to the community about the
events.

With the help of Executive
Committee President Rob Rain,
Chair and President of the Stu-
dent Bar Association Adam Hull,
and Sergent-at-Arrns Quiana
McKenzie, we were able to come
to an agreement that allowed us to
report on the hearing.

As you will see in this issue,
we focused on the atmosphere of
the audience in Lee Chapel and
the Commons theater, along with
student reactions and opinions to
the hearing and verdict.

We were not, however, permit-
ted to release details, including
the names of the accused, the wit-
nesses called or any speciﬁc facts
of the case.

We agreed to these restrictions
because an open hearing is differ-
ent from a public trial in a court
of law.

Rain and the EC ﬁrmly believe
that speciﬁc‘ infonnation about
open hearings should not extend
beyond current students, faculty,
faculty emeritus and staﬁ‘. Be-
cause our joint issue will be so
readily available to people who
are not members of the W&L
community, we agreed it would
be inappropriate to publish the
name of the accused or details of
the case.

One of the EC’s most impor-
tant concerns was protecting the
privacy of the witnesses and ju-
rors. As Rain pointed out, none
of these witnesses or jurors vol-
unteered for this job. Each was
summoned by the EC or the ac-
cused and had to obey.

We came to the conclusion
that we could provide thorough
and accurate coverage of the
day’s events and student reactions
without focusing on the details.
Above anything else, we wanted
to be able to give the community
an accurate picture of the events
and news of the day.

We also need to extend a huge
thank you to all the Trident and
Ring-Tum Phi writers and pho-
tographers who took time out of
their days to help make this spe-
cial edition possible.

Thank you to all of the writers,
editors and photographers who
spent their part of all of Wednes-
day in or outside of Lee Chapel
and the Commons theater.

This week we have managed
to put out a total of 34 pages over

Putting out a weekly paper
requires a hard-working and dedi-
cated staff. Putting out three pa-
pers in one week requires a staff
willing to forgo sleep, work long
hours and put their newspapers in
front of all other concerns.

We are also greatly indebted
to the staff of A Week in General,
who helped us interview students
and shared footage of the inter-
views they ﬁhned throughout the
day.

This open hearing was ex-
tremely difficult for many mem-
bers of the community, but we
hope our coverage has helped
provide an accurate and thorough
record of this important week.

The hearing was the talk of
campus throughout the day.
Students in the Marketplace
were discussing the hearing at
10 a.m. while eating their break-
fast, and students coming in and
out of both the chapel and the-
ater were eagerly dissecting the
atmosphere and testimony.

During breaks between wit-
nesses, Lee Chapel was full of
whispers and murmured con-
versations among the audience.

Even students who could not
watch the proceedings were
constantly trying to stay abreast
of the news.

“When we go for a long peri-
od of time without an open hear-
ing, people are still aware the
honor system is here and it’s a
big part of our lives,” Rain said.
“For one day, for the entire uni-
versity community to focus on
the honor system and focus on
an open hearing, I think that’s
great for the student body as a
whole.”

Despite the constant in and
out traffic, students were re-
spectful of the proceedings.
Hull and McKenzie had been
prepared to take action if stu-
dents were disruptive, but aside
from Hull’s late aftemoon Wam-
ing to turn off cell phones, the
proceedings went off without
any major problems. I

“I was really surprised at how
smoothly [the hearing] went,”
Hull said. “We were able to deal
with a lot of the more conten-
tious issues before the [hearing]

began—issues like admissibility
and the scope of the trial—that’s
why we had a stipulation of facts
at the start.”

While attendance among
students was fairly high—even
though just two days of classes
remain before exams——tumout
among faculty and staff was far
lower. A scattering of faculty
were seated near the rear of the
chapel during most parts of the
day, but the majority did not at-
tend the hearing.

Most of the major academic

administrators were present for
at least part of the hearing. The
lone exception was -President
Ruscio. Dean of Students Dawn
Watkins said he was out of town
and had been unable to return
to campus. Watkins was at the
hearing after arriving home from
Orlando early that morning.

Despite the long day of pro-
ceedings, Lee Chapel was nearly
full when Hull ﬁnally delivered
the verdict.

As proscribed by the White
Book, the jurors voted by anony-

mous ballot and did not know the
outcome until Hull announced
it. Eight votes would have been
needed for a guilty verdict. The
jurors were sequestered in the
Morris House during breaks and
their deliberations.

Ledlie said the hearing re-af-
ﬁrmed the community’s faith in
the honor system.

“Based on the reaction in Lee
Chapel I don’t think you can
have any doubt that the system
works,” she said.

PHI COLUMNIST

The honor system was tested
yesterday by a mix of uncom-
fortable students that seemed
neither representative of the
student body nor appropriately
authoritative in their positions.

As our fundamental academ-
ic structure came under question
in the open hearing, one couldn’t
help but wonder, who was doing
the asking?

Between the fumbling over
papers and seeming inability
to ask a coherent question, the
Executive Committee represen-
tatives and the honor advocates
weren’t leading so much as be-
ing led.

Granted: an open hearing I
hasn’t happened on our campus
in 12 years.

But what does it say for us
that our academic careers hang
in a balance maintained by
people who don’t seem to know
what they’re doing?

You can almost forgive EC
representative Jordan Campbell
for not knowing that you have
to ask a witness a question.

You can almost forgive hon-
or advocate Josh Humphries for
being intimidated by a witness.

You can almost forgive the

newly—elected EC president Josh
Payne for his shaky delivery.

Until you realize that the
premise of your education is on
the line.

The EC representatives, for
their part, got plenty of collab-
orative help from their fellow
EC members during breaks.

But Josh Payne, the leader of
sorts, held his cards with shak-
ing hands and tripped over his
own tongue.

Running his hands though his
floppy black hair, he repeated
himself in that soft, husky voice
at least once every question, and
didn’t seem to really know what
he was asking.

Humphries forgot who was
in charge of questioning when
dealing with witnesses.

He, like Payne, had a quiet
delivery with no apparent direc-
tion.

Beads of nervous sweat ap-
peared on his forehead, even
as he questioned his own wit-
nesses.

Campbell’s voice, echoing
from the pristine white walls of
the chapel, shook with passion
for honor. But the speech itself
had little substance, and he was
practically non—existent for the
rest of the hearing.

The one shining star in the

upset about this. I think it

is completely wrong and it

makes a terrible statement about

the system we use here. The sys-

tem I am terribly upset about, of
course, is Groupwise.

Mass emailing took forever

to notify all the students, and as

Ihave to say, I’m terribly

a result, I missed EASILY the ,

most dramatic thing to happen
at this school during my FOUR
years, possibly ever.

According to the fastest mov-
ing object in Virginia, W&L’s
rumor mill, Lee Chapel erupted
when the gavel hit the table and
the verdict was read.

The atmosphere must have
been electric. I see something
analogous to the response to
Robert Sean Leonard’s perfor-
mance of Puck in Dead Poet’s

. Society, the liberal reaction after
the Scopes monkey trial, and the
cheering in the ﬁnal seconds of
a certain 1980 Olympic hockey
game (which was a semiﬁnal, by
the way). And I have to say, I’m
happy for the guy/girl (because
we can’t actually talk about it).

I caught most of the trial in
the Commons Theater, and as I
sat down, I remarked to my next
door neighbor how this trial felt
like such a throwback.

It was then pointed out to
me that I was watching this on
closed circuit television beamed
there from Lee Chapel, so so
much for nostalgia. Neverthe-

less, the history was apparent.

The trial was a manifestation
of the ancient White Book, the
stage ﬁlled with modern re—en-
actors of dusty history. The por-
traits of George Washington and
Bobby Lee, staring at witnesses
and the defendant with their
gaze of truth, were as pregnant
a symbol as one could possibly
imagine.

A famous truth-teller and the
original southern gentleman,
ﬂanking the students as they
breathed life back into I their
honorable legacies. If nothing
else, it was goddamned cool.

The buzz around campus was
palpable. I shove that in the face
of any faculty member who be-
lieves the students are apathetic.
Just give us a controversial hon-
or violation concerning a well-
known guy/girl on campus, and
we’ll put on our cocktail gear
and pay attention.

And the trial itself was like
a 1,000 times better version of
Court TV. Some of it was real,
high comedy. But kidding aside,
it was impressive to see campus
so alive today. People cared,
plain and simple.

But what does the verdict say I

about the student body? What
implications does it have? Af-
ter such an interesting, and no
doubt exhausting day, what are
the major issues that linger?
Without going into too much
detail about the case (because I
ain’t allowed), I think the ver-
dict of the trial says something
important about the school: stu-
dents just don’t buy an absolute

reading of the White Book.

I don’t mean to be a nega-
tive nancy here, but if the jury
made a LITERAL interpretation
of the White Book, my guess is
the verdict would have been dif-
ferent. However, don’t misread
that as condemnation. I think
the verdict was the correct deci-
sion, but I think it was apparent
there was some shady business
going on as well.

I hate being so vague, but the
EC says I have to be.

It may not be the case that
a literal interpretation would
have changed the verdict, as it is
clearly more complicated than
that, but that’s certainly what it
looked like.

And what the students effec-
tively said is that a violation like
that should not be punishable by
expulsion from school. If things
of this nature are punishable by
expulsion, then a TON of people
at this school should pack their
bags.

The ﬂipside, of course, is
the slippery slope argument.
No breech of honor is insigniﬁ-
cant. One small violation is still
a breech of trust, and if we let
it one small thing slide, how far
will it go?

As usual, I believe the anser
lies somewhere in the middle.
Just as prohibition and the ad-
ministration’s deﬁnition of haz-
ing illustrate, absolutist policies
don’t make sense in practice.

There are always exceptions.
Such cut and dry deﬁnitions
work well when 450 petriﬁed
freshmen sit in Lee Chapel for

the explanation of the honor
system‘, but it doesn’t always
work well when there is an in-
tricate and excessively compli-
cated case at hand. (Which, by
the way, was the most infuriat-
ing part of the case. Each side
spent the whole time confus-
ing each other with terms that
95 percent of the student body
wouldn’t understand with a two
hour tutorial).

There were gray areas in this
case. And today, the intent of
the defendant to break the rules
was a major area of reasonable
doubt. But that’s not to say that
the honor system is ﬂawed. I
think it worked well today. The
honor system is simple, but it’s
open for interpretation by the
student body.

The Constitution is worded
in a similar manner, and that’s
why it works, because ideally
there is a give and take between
letter of the law and the modern
collective’s opinion of what is
right.

And today, the student body
exercised their right to interpret
the White Book. I hate to get
all schmaltzy on you here, but
I think it worked. The White
Book says that, “the Honor Sys-
tem condemns only acts that the
current student generation views
as breaches of the community’s
trust,” and that was upheld in
Lee Chapel last night.

The trial proved it, the ver-
dict said it, and the roar of the
crowd at 8:15 was its exclama-
tion point.

I’mjust sorry I missed it.

open hearing was honor advo-
cate Jane Ledlie, who at least
utilized basic public speaking
skills and kept her composure.

She had at least a basic un-
derstanding of what was going
on, and wasn’t afraid to show
it.

Standing before a half-ca-
pacity Lee Chapel, she seemed
more relaxed than her col-
leagues, maintaining control in

her simple suit and pearls. She
wore no make-up, and didn’t
have a fancy haircut.

But let me tell you, Plain Jane
at least convinced me that she
was giving me the plain facts.

Thank God she was there.

In all fairness, these repre-
sentatives and advocates are just
students. They are our own age,
with practically the same level

_of experience as any one of us
has in giving legal arguments.

Except that they have the
enormous responsibility of de-
ciding whether students gel
kicked out.

Shouldn’t there be some kind
of training for this?

It’s disconcerting to think
that on a day when a fear of au-
thority loomed over Lee Chapel
like a deep black cloud, promis-
ing to rain punishment, those in
charge of arguing the case fell
nervous.

It’s a huge responsibility to
take on, but confusion over the
process raises questions about
it.

The true voice of the commu-
nity was heard—and felt—when
the verdict was announced: be-
fore Chair Adam Hull could ﬁn-
ish reading, the crowd jumped
from their seats and cheered,
running for the door to congrat-
ulate the exonerated student and
chattering excitedly.

‘There were tears and smiles
and hugs and sighs of relief as
students rushed off to celebrate
(or perhaps do homework).

Too bad the advocates and
representatives couldn’t capture
that kind of decisiveness in their

arguments.
That is, after all, their job.

The tragic shootings at Virginia
Tech over Washington and Lee’s spring
break produced shock and horror
throughout the Lexington community.

Amidst the confusion of the trage-
dy’s aftermath, faculty, students, and
staff were left to deal with their grief
and wonder if such an event could hap-
pen here.

With most students off campus,
the administration nonetheless acted
quickly in response to the news. Imme-
diately following the shootings, Presi-
dent Ruscio contacted Tech ofﬁcials to
offer condolences and whatever sup-
port W&L could provide.

Law students organized a vigil that
same day outside Lee Chapel, and
members of the University commu-
nity awoke the next morning to ﬁnd
an e-mail from Ruscio announcing a
campus-wide moment of silence com-
memorating the victims.

University ofﬁcials expressed
“shock” at the brutality displayed so
close to home. Said William C. “Burr”
Datz, Coordinator of Religious Life, “it
was hard to believe that this was taking
place in a place where I had walked.”

Datz immediately began prepara-‘
tions for a vigil the following week that
would allow undergraduate students to
“grieve and support one another” as
well as to express solidarity with the

For Dean of Students Dawn Wat-
kins, an alumna of Virginia Tech’s
undergraduate and Masters programs,
the tragedy had a distinctly personal
dimension. In Italy when the story
broke, she struggled to get the latest
news coming out of Blacksburg. Upon
returning home, she found a Red Cross
emergency response center set up in
the Roanoke airport. The airport was
decorated in Tech’s colors.

“It was at that point that I realized it
was considered a national tragedy. . . it’s
comforting to know how much people
care, and it also makes the pain much
more real,” she said. “I’m still trying to
get my mind around it.”

The tragedy has sparked renewed
examination of current campus securi-
ty plans. The administration maintains
a Campus Crisis Management Plan
(CCMP), which Dean Watkins says is
always being revisited.

“It’s a living document,” she said.

There are subsections of the plan
dealing with speciﬁc subject areas,
such as student affairs. Portions of

the plan are reﬂected in other univer-

sity programs such as Dorm Counselor
training.

According to a statement issued by
Ruscio, the CCMP was recently revised
and updated with a speciﬁc section
dealing with “Violent Persons on Cam-

people safe, it takes the community. Never think you ’re

bothering the police by reporting suspicious behavior ”

Steve crowder

pus.” It stresses communication as key
during any crisis. There are plans to
install a siren system that would project
a lockdown alert throughout campus.

In a lockdown, Director of Public
Safety Mike Young advises all students,
faculty, and staff to “remain where they
are...until ordered to move by public
safety personnel. We are developing a
warning plan for all community mem-
bers that will provide guidance on what
to do in these cases.” Discussions about
a possible text-messaging system that
would alert students to a crisis are also
ongoing.

All parties agree that crisis response
cannot be the whole of the community’s
efforts. Police Chief Steve Crowder
stated that there is “absolutely nothing”
the police can do to prevent a shooter
from inﬂicting harm on the campus.
Burr Datz concurred, saying that “it
could happen anywhere; if somebody
methodically wants to inﬂict damage,
and they’re that sick, ill, diseased~

- ment.

they’re going to do it.”

Chief Crowder instead called for
vigilance, communication, and cooper-
ation among the members of the com-
munity—including students, campus
security, VMI, townspeople, and the
Lexington policehto identify trouble-
some signs early. “It takes more than
the police department to keep people
safe,” he said. “It takes the community.
Never think you’re bothering the police
by reporting suspicious behavior.”

Campus security maintains a close
relationship with the police depart-
W&L’s Public Safety Depart-
ment is automatically notiﬁed about all
911 calls from the campus. They police
and public safety departments also
have a shared radio frequency.

Administrators praise W&L’s com-
munity as exactly the kind of safety net
needed to protect the campus. “I doubt
[something like Virginia Tech] would
happen here. . .we’ve got this culture of
care, we’re small enough, we appear to

nity...where we watch out for one an-
other. Whether it’s Peer Counselors or
Dorm Counselors or faculty or house
directors or chapter presidents or cam-
pus ministry, those are all areas we all
stay tapped into to try to understand if
someone needs help.” ‘ _

“It’s important for us all to remem-
ber that we are a community that needs
to look out for one another, that we
need to support one another, and if we
think a friend—or even not a friend—is
in trouble, then we all need to be doing
something about it,” she added.

Watkins also ensures the commu-
nity that the university has the tools
necessary to deal with students that are
a potential threat to self or others. Un-
der current educational privacy laws,
administrators are allowed to involve
parents in cases dealing with such anti-
social behavior. “We do so and contin-
ue to do so,” she remarked, in the “rare
instances” it is necessary.

The trials of the past week had little
effect on this year ’s Accepted Students’
Day; record-breaking crowds expressed
conﬁdence in the W&L community
to provide a safe environment for the
Class of 2011.

Dean Watkins received just a single
question all day long regarding W&L’s
security preparations in the wake of the
tragedy.

~ Vigil honors victims of Tech tragedy

W&L community pauses to reﬂect on the lives lost in shootings at Virginia Tech

By Grace Wang
‘} STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee students, faculty,
. and administration gathered last Monday
ii to remember the victims of the shooting
i at Virginia Tech
As attendants ﬁled in, sporting Vir-
. ginia Tech gear and orange and maroon
ribbons, Burr Datz and Logan Gibson
played soothing, moumful music.

Dean Watkins, an alumna of Tech,
started the evening with a recount of
where she was when she ﬁrst heard the
tragic news, a story that left her in tears.

“W As the vigil progressed, this emotional
intensity ampliﬁed as President Ruscio, a
VMI cadet, local religious leaders, and
others, shared their reactions from the
tragedy.

Several of the speakers led prayers
with the group and honored the deceased

 

by name.

Gradually, the Cohen Amphitheater
was illuminated by hundreds of candles,
each blowing in the wind and held in

. W&L’s support for Tech.

Student at the candlelight vigil came
for varying reasons. Many have friends
or high school classmates who now go to
school at Virginia Tech.

Stephanie Marks, a freshman from
Frederick, Md., was not personally af-
fected by the shooting but had friends
at Tech whose friends were injured or
killed.

She felt compelled to attend the vigil,
explaining that it was “a day of support.”

“It’s absolutely shocking to think that
this would occur on a college campus. ,”
said Marks. “For a college student, it re-
ally hits close to home.”

Annie Blakey, a freshman from Nor-
folk, Va., has a best friend from high

school currently at Tech.

She recalls watching the news at home
during spring break.

Blakey said, “I have a lot of friends at
Tech, and I felt helpless at home because
I couldn’t do anything to help them.”

Blakey also added that attending the

W&L vigil helped her come to terms with
the shooting and gave her a sense of clo-
sure. .
She said, “Going to the vigil helped
me to face it on my own and not from
the perspective of being concerned about
friends.”

Casidhe Horan, a sophomore from
Richmond, Va., has attended everything
from elementary, middle, and high school
to basketball games to Girl Scouts with
one of her best friends, Allison Cook.

A Tech sophomore, Cook suffered
three gunshot wounds the day of the
shooting.

When the shootings began, Cook was
in French class in Norris Hall, the aca-
demic building that suffered the greatest
number of casualties.

The students’ attempt to blockade the
door failed as the gunman pushed his
way into the classroom and began ﬁring
at the ﬁrst row.

Amazingly, with three bullets lodged
into her right side, Allison was only one
of three or four individuals to walk out of
the class of 22.

Horan said, ‘‘I truly believe it was
nothing short of .a miracle in the midst of
evil that she survived.”

Horan attended a vigil in Richmond
during spring break, but she admits that
she needed W&L’s candlelight vigil.

She said, “I needed to hug all of my
friends here because I found out ﬁrst-
hand that day that only a few millimeters
can be the difference between life and

death. I found out how easy it can be to
lose someone you love forever. . .I needed
to talk about it in Lexington. I needed to
grieve at my university.”

Unfortunately, Rosemary Kelley, a
freshman from West Springﬁeld, Va., was
a high school classmate, teammate, and
close friend of one of the victims, Leslie
Sherman.

Kelley and Sherman ran cross-coun-
try and track for three years together and
were both members of the French Club,
History Honor Society, and National
Honor Society.

In attending the vigil, Kelley wanted
to remember her good friend Leslie.

She said, “Leslie has had a tremendous
impact on my life. . .she was charismatic,
smiling, ﬁmny, respectful, intelligent,
and genuine. The loss of such a beautiful
and valued life is difficult, and by going
to the vigil, I wanted to remember her.”

An old, ignorant man makes a ra-

been pop star exits rehab with a new
wig. The paternity test for the child
of a deceased drug addict is released
in the Bahamas. This is what we call
news.

Then, a deranged 23-year-old Eng-
lish major spills the blood of 33, in-
cluding his own, on the Virginia Tech

COLU M msr

In my search for an ever-larger
group of victims of my rambling ego, I
have decided to use this excellent plat-
form to write about various theorists.
This week’s topic is the work of Roger
Caillois: Man, Play and Games.

In the book, Caillois analyzes the
four basic elements of play and how
the games are inﬂuenced by the sur-
rounding society. The four basic types
are competition (agon), chance (alea),
simulation (mimicry), and vertigo
(ilinx). ,,__ ._ ..

Most g_a,1,;.;;,s_; include several of
these four. I In football, for example,
the teams are subject to rules that en-
sure fair competition (same amount of
players on the ﬁeld), but at the same
time, luck plays a role (the way the
ball bounces).

Other games involve simulation,
such as playing doctor, where there is
no way to win (although this particular
one does have a desirable outcome. . .).
The ﬁnal type of play is vertigo,

tions than answers. Everything from
the violence in our movies, to our gun
laws, to our policy on foreign nationals
in American universities, will be ques-
tioned, re-examined, and criticized.

Fingers will be pointed at officials
from Virginia Tech for not advising
students or ‘asking police for help im-
mediately after the dorm attack. The
counselors and professors who no-
ticed Cho Seung-Hui’s violent writ-
ing will also take some unnecessary
blame. The students who saw him as a
loner will wonder why they didn’t do
enough.

None of this will help.

None of this will bring back the 32
innocent victims. No media coverage
in the world will stop this from hap-
pening again.

That’s the truly frightening part.

lose bodily control and feel a thrill of
helplessness, as experienced on roller
coasters.

Caillois examines how most mod-
em societies mainly focus on games
of chance and competition, and only
rarely allow the two other forms.

Primitive societies, on the other
hand, use games of simulation and
vertigo in order to connect with the
gods and to retell myths and legends.

Caillois tracks the chance in games
to Athens in ancient Greece, where the
rationalistic democracy could not al-
low its citizens to indulge in the fren-
zied festivals of the Dionysus cult.

So instead, games that promoted
the individual body and mind were
preferred and included in the

No matter what we do, nothing will
make a repeat of that horriﬁc morning
an impossibility.

We can and should restrict access
to guns for those who pose a threat to
others, but the disgustingly determined
individuals like this one will still ﬁnd
a way.

We cannot put airport-like security
in every dorm building, classroom,
and library in the United States. For
that matter, we can’t put it in every
movie theater and park either.

We cannot constantly watch over
everyone who is on anti-depressants,
considered to have “stalker” tenden-
cies, or writes violent plays. All the
dots connect when it’s too late and
that’s part of the problem.

So what can we do?

What type of society do we live in

In the entire Western world, sports
are all individualized, even team
sports.

You are never a better player than
the abilities your body have and the
strategies that your mind can come up
with.

For the professional player, society
treats him as an individual, but what
about the fans?

They all trade in a part of their per-
sonality by putting on the team colors,
and thereby gain a share in the com-
munal identity and whole.

For a brief moment the audience
is ﬁlled with a feeling of connectivity
and belonging, so even though they
are watching a game, they themselves
participate in a game of simulation.

e power

when something like this is apparently
inevitable? What on earth can we pos-
sibly do about the Cho Seung-Huis
of the world? All we can do is come
together, mourn, grieve, and hopefully
unite in a community, in a society,
where tragedies like this just do not
happen.

We should have every conversation
about the aspects of our society that
we need to change, the aspects that
this terror has brought to light.

But if there is one thing we cannot
afford to lose after this tragedy, it is
the feeling of community we always
have after something like this hap-
pens. Unfortunately, that feeling is the
ﬁrst thing we lose after a while.

That community may be the one

thing that can save us from it happen-

ing again.

field

of simulation

Even at W&L, we all participate in
games all the time, aside from the ob-
vious sport events.

Mixers and Halloween provide the
participants an opportunity to assume
different roles and positions, and alco-
hol and drugs provide the feeling of
vertigo (even though Caillois calls the
use of drugs for false vertigo, it stills
knocks people off their feet every
weekend).

Personally, my saddest experience
was at the Fancy Dress Ball, where the
masks could have been the tools for
an enormous game of simulation, but
instead, people quickly lost interest
and deﬂated the event of any power it
could have had.

So think about it.

Olympic games.

This, of course, all seems
very long-winded and useless,
but by broadening the deﬁni-
tion of a game to various non-
productive pastime events,
Caillois opens a discussion of
what attributes are perceived
as admirable.

VT needs

While national press
dramatizes tragedy,
the Hokies try to heal

hen tragedy struck Virginia

Tech earlier this month,

one news organization led .
the way with its coverage.

It wasn’t CNN, NBC, or the Washington
Post who provided the best coverage.

Brian Williams, Anderson Cooper, and
Nancy Grace weren’t the people who got
the story right.

The best coverage came from the Colle-
giate Times, Tech’s student-run newspaper.
The Times, working with a staff of about 35
people, turned out an amazing succession
of newspapers in the days after the shoot-
ing.

Their work is proof that the best press
coverage is sometimes the least sensation- .
al. While the national press was competing
for big headlines and dramatic footage, the
journalists at Virginia Tech were just qui-
etly doing their job.

The-paper’s website got so many hits
that they had to move over to a bigger serv-
er. Using the web, the Times was reporting
on the story by 9:45 a.m., just two hours
after the initial shooting.

Throughout the past two weeks, the stu-
dent journalists at Virginia Tech have been
consistently scooping news organizations
with multi-million dollar budgets. Their
coverage has been poignant, but the paper
has also not shied away from serious inves-
tigative reporting.

One day aﬂer the shooting, the paper ran
a story that said the school had been slow ‘
to order a lockdown of West Ambler-John-
son Hall, where gunman Cho Seung-Hui
killed two students nearly two hours before
he shot and killed 30 more people in Nor- C
ris Hall.

Along the way, the paper has managed to
provide comprehensive coverage while still
respecting the privacy of 33 families who
are grieving from this tragedy. The paper’s
photographers and reporters have provided
coverage that students have embraced.

Students at Tech were frustrated-—and at
times furious—with how the national me-
dia covered the events of Monday, April 16.
But while they tried to keep national report-
ers out, students turned around and were
willing to speak with their fellow students.

There’s no great secret to why Tech .
students would speak with the Collegiate

' Times but wanted to shut out the national
press. While the national press was sen-
sationalizing the tragedy and blanketing
Blacksburg with cameras, the Times was
providing coverage that mattered.

One minute, these Tech students were
shoving past TV cameras so they could
make it to class. The next minute they were
giving the Times interviews describing
what they went through on April 16.

The staffers at the Collegiate Times
weren’t worried about television ratings or
newspaper sales. Instead of trying to draw 
the most readers or make the biggest splash,
these students covered the story thoroughly,
accurately, and respectﬁilly. .

Their work was a spectacular success. ;

Media sensationalism is nothing new. '
It’s been going on in American journalism
since the 1800s. But the Collegiate Times
has showed us this month that the best re-
porting is sometimes the quietest.

The coverage even has some journalists
saying that the paper deserves a Pulitzer
Prize, joumalism’s highest honor.

The Pulitzer judges could not recall
a student organization ever winning that .
award. That should change next spring ’
when the Pulitzer awards for 2007 are an-
nounced.

, The Washington Post might win Pulit-
zers for its coverage of the Army’s Walter
Reed Medical Center. Perhaps the New
York Times will win awards. But both of
those organizations are run by profession-
als, not students. '

Whether or not the Collegiate Times
wins that award, during the last two weeks
that small collegiate paper has shown jour-
nalism at its finest.

Tech fair promotes
hidden resources

Experts Show 0]?‘ new technology

By Emlly Peck
surr WRITER

Technology experts gathered
Friday to show off the latest tools
available to students and faculty
at Washington and Lee.

The event featured poster ses-
sions and presentations on tech-
nology tools available to students
and faculty.

Leybum Library and Univer-
sity Computing staff members
discussed topics covering every-
thing from simple web skills (for
technologically challenged indi-
viduals) to slightly more compli-
cated software like Refworks, a
program designed to automati-
cally produce a bibliography.

Students and faculty who
stopped by the fair were even
eligible for prizes, including an
80GB video Ipod and an Epson
laser printer. Turnout was low,
however, despite the giveaways.

The prizes were purchased
with funds from University
Computing and Leybum Library
in the hope that students would
be encouraged to attend, said
John White, one of the organiz-
ers of the fair and head of the
University Help Desk. “The fair
was designed to generate interest
in technologies,” said White.

The small number of students
who wandered in and out of the
fair throughout the day would
seem to indicate that interest
in technology is far from high
among students.

Fellow organizer and Refer-
ence Librarian John Tombarge,
said that the event wasn’t just in-
tended for students but for mem-
bers of the faculty as well.

W&L spends a good deal |

of money each year on giving
students and professors access
to technologies and online da-
tabases like J-STOR. J—STOR
contains millions of articles from

scholarly journals. These jour-
nals are also printed, but the on-
line database give students and
faculty access to all of the articles
in one convenient location.

Despite the availability of
these tools, “people don’t make
as much use out of them as they
might,” said Tombarge.

While the librarians were
helping explain research tech-
nology, students who work at the
help desk had a poster session
discussing the perils of social
software. With the explosion
of sites like MySpace and Face-
book and the extensive use of
programs like instant messenger,

students are not always careful
about what sort of information
they are showing the world.

The fair’s purpose was to
inform the W&L community of

just how many resources are at '

their disposal and to provide in-
struction on how to access these
tools.

The technology may not be
glamorous, but it can come in
handy the next time a profes-
sor assigns a 30—page term pa-
per. Further questions about the
goods on display can be referred
to Tombarge at Leybum Library
or to White at the computing
help desk.

The men’s tennis team has
performed strongly over the last
few weeks, claiming the ODAC
championship in dominating
fashion. The team handily beat
Roanoke and Hampden-Sydney
9-0 to win the ODAC tournament.
They also knocked off fourteenth
ranked Carnegie Mellon 6-3. The
Generals are currently 20-2 and
ranked 17th nationally.

First, the Generals went up
against the Tartans of Carnegie
Mellon. This tough out of con-
ference opponent came in at 17-
4 and ranked 14th in the country.
W&L split the singles matched
3-3. The Generals had wins from
Jon Malooly, Stuart Sanford,
and Nelson Bunn. Number two
Malooly defeated Ravi Raghavan
in three sets (6-4, 6-7 (2-7), 11-9).
Junior Stuart Sanford also pitched
in with a three set victory over
CMU’s Yiran Liu (6-1, 6-7 (5-7),
6-3). After a tough ﬁrst set, junior
Nelson Bunn ﬁnished the match
strongly, beating Jordan Koslosky
3-6, 6-0, 6-0. W&L was too good
for CMU in the doubles, win-
ning all three matches. Tim Ross
and Stuart Sanford defeated Ravi
Raghavan and Jordan Koslosky
8-2. Generals Jamie McCardell
and Jon Malooly came out victo-
rious over James Muliawan and
Jon Spero 9-8. Seth Feibelman
and Alex Brooke then ﬁnished off
Andrew Clearﬁeld and Yiran Liu
8-6. These doubles matches were
the difference as the Generals up-
set the Tartans. This win tied a
school record for wins set over 30
years ago.

The team next faced the
Hampden-Sydney Tigers in the
semiﬁnals of the ODAC tourna-
ment. W&L‘ proved to be the far
superior team winning 9-0. None
of the matches were very close.
Number one Tim Ross defeated
William Moss by default followed
by a 6-1, 6-0 win by Jon Malooly.
Seth Feibelman kept the streak
going, defeating James Labrot.
Stuart Sanford scored an impres-
sive victory 6-0, 6-0 against Jenks
Snyder. The closest matches of
the day was Jamie McCardell’s
and Nelson Burm’s 6-1, 6-1 victo-
ries for the Generals. W&L also
showed their doubles skill, win-
ning all three matches handily.
W&L moved to 19-2 and earned a
trip to the ODAC championship.

In the championship match,
W&L played 15-7 Roanoke. The
Generals came in and left unde-
feated in ODAC competition,
notching another 9-0 victory.
Tim Ross came out with another
victory over Kyle Allen 6-4, 6-
2. Jon Malooly, Stuart Sanford,
and Jamie McCardell also won
in two sets. Seth Feibelman de-
feated Sam Sherill 4-6, 7-5, 10-
5. Nelson Bunn rounded out the
singles play with another come-
back victory 1-6, 6-4, 10-8 over
Greg Oliff. The doubles play was
not much closer as the Generals
won two matches 8-4 and one
by a score of 8-3. The Generals
showed they deserved to win the
championship and were the best
team in the ODAC.

The Generals will continue
there record-breaking season at
the Division III national champi-
onship ﬁrst round May 4"‘.

Men’s Golf
Drives for

Nationals

Places second

at OD/1 Cs ‘

in victory

The Washington and Lee
men’s golf team completed its
regular season this past weekend
by placing second at the ODAC
Championship held at Poplar
Grove Golf Course in Amherst,
Va. The only team to card a lower
score than the Generals was Guil-
ford, who is ranked second in the
country.

The Generals were led by ju-
nior Nathaniel James who tied for
third overall, carding an evenﬂpar
216.

After round one, the Generals
were in third place with a team
score of 297, 14 shots behind
leader Guilford and just four shots
behind second place Bridgewater.
On day two, the Generals came
out ﬁring, shooting a 287 as a
team and cutting Guilford’s lead
in half to just seven strokes.

“Our second day 287 was
also really gratifying because
we proved we can keep up with
anyone and that we are a team to
fear,” said senior Matthew Leis-
man.

However, day three slowed the
momentum as diﬁicult playing
conditions precluded the Gener-
als making a ﬁnal push towards

winning the .tournament_.

“The? pins weren’t necessarily
harder, but as we approached the
back nine the wind picked up a lot
andthe greens became extremely
hard to the point where holding
the greens with the wind was
nearly impossible,” said Leisman.
“The scores reﬂected the harder
conditions.”

Still, as a team the Generals
posted a 306, the third-lowest
score of any team that round, and
James managed an even-par 72.

Despite placing second to a
highly ranked team, some golfers
were not satisﬁed with their ﬁn-
ish.

“I think as a team we were a
little disappointed with our ﬁnish.
Despite the fact that Guilford is
ranked number two in the coun-
try, we really felt that we had a
chance to play well and beat them
as we never really played to our
potential earlier in the season,”
said Leisman. “However, we were
heat by a very good team so we
are not totally disappointed. My
teammates and I approach every
tournament with the intent to win,
especially with a guy like Nathan-
iel [James] on our team.”

In addition to recording the
best score for the Generals, James
took home the Scholar-Athlete of
the Year Award, was named to the
all-toumament team and First All-
ODAC Team. Teammate Leisman
made Second Team All-ODAC
and Anthony Zappin was dubbed
Honorable Mention All-ODAC.

The team also enjoyed their
time together off the ﬁeld.

“I think we really just enjoy
each others company and have
grown very close as a group so
every minute is a treat,” said Leis-
man. “We like messing around
in the hotel by playing hall mini
golf, and sometimes we’re lucky
enough to get our parents to take
us out for free food at nice restau-
rants.”

Though the team did not re-
ceive the ODAC’s automatic bid
to the national tournament, the
team was optimistic about their
chances at an at large bid. In the
case the team does not receive a
bid, James is likely to be invited
to compete as an individual.

“[James] is one of, if not the,
top player in the nation,” said
Leisman. As for the team, Leis-
man said, “We do however feel
justiﬁed in getting a bid, and we
would certainly compete.”

If selected, the Generals would
compete on May 15-18 in Mt.
Carmel, Indiana.

their opening at-bat, but shortly
thereafter RMC took the lead
with a ﬁve-run third. The Gener-
als scored eight unanswered runs,
beginning with six in the bot-
tom of the fourth, to win the day.
W&L’s Brendan Clark pitched
only 3.1 innings but allowed no
earned runs and was credited with
the win. The game was closed out
by junior Jeff Pharis and fresh-
man Jim Plantholt.

Having escaped the Yellow
Jackets, the Generals faced a more
formidable opponent with the
same do-or-die situation. On Sat-
urday the squad faced third -seed-

ed Lynchburg. The Generals had
beaten the Hornets in both games
of their doubleheader in March.
Those games were in Lexington,
however, and the proximity of the
tournament’s supposedly neutral
venue to the Lynchburg campus
played a role in Lynchburg’s 14-2
win, which knocked the Generals
out of the tournament.

The Generals never really
stood a chance as LC jumped to
a ﬁve-run lead in the ﬁrst inning
against W&L freshman Chuck
Davidson, who lasted only 0.2 in-
nings before surrendering to the
bullpen.

The tournament left the squad
with an 18-14 overall record,
including pre-season and post-
season matches. In a year many
regarded as a time to rebuild
following the graduation of two
of W&L’s all time best — Taylor
McConnell and Peter Dean. Last
year, the first since their gradu-
ation, the squad was 18-15-1.
This year’s strong freshman class
could be the next golden genera-
tion for the illustrious program
and for manager Stickley, three-
time ODAC coach of the year and
the winningest baseball skipper in
school history.

Season ends for baseball

Team beats Randolph-Macon but falls to Lynchburg in a 14-2 defeat

By Brian Devine
STAFF WRITER

When a team enters a six-
team tournament as the number
ﬁve seed, most outside observ-
ers would expect it to go out
early, defeated quietly in the early
rounds. For the Washington and
Lee baseball team, simply reach-

ing the end-of-season conference
tournament, held April 26-29 in
Lynchburg, was an accomplish-
ment.

Before the season, manager
Jeff Stickley stated that “our ex-
pectation is always to make the
ODAC Tournament ﬁeld.” De-
spite reaching Stickley’s basic
goal with a record of I8-l4, the

team won only against sixth-seed-
ed Randolph-Macon and lost two
games to exit the tournament on
Saturday.

On Thursday, the squad
opened with a 7-3 loss to see-
ond-seeded Hampden—Sydney.
A three-run third inning and a
three-run fourth gave the Tigers a
7-2 lead, and their pitching staff

never let the Generals back in.

Women sweep ODAC tennis

F ourth-ranked team and 2006 runner—up prepares for a run at NCAA title

By Kevin Corn
smrr warm:

The women’s tennis team was
very busy over spring break with
matches against rivals Emory

University and Se-

s°°'°s wanee.
w&L 9 Later, the wom-
en were back in
ODAC 0 Lexington for the
ODAC Champion-
ships.

Considering Washington and
Lee ﬁnished second to Emory at
NCAAs last year, this was an ex-

, citing match with quite a bit on

the line.

The Generals traveled to At-
lanta with conﬁdence. This con-
ﬁdence showed as number I and
2 doubles teams consisting of
Emily Applegate and Kristen Mc-
Clung, and Katie Tabb and Ginny
Wortham won their games 8-4
and 8-1 respectively.

Emory was able to defeat
freshmen Katie Bouret and Lau-
ren Caire 8-3. ‘

In the singles games, the Gen-
erals took four of the six games.

These were won by Applegate,
Wortham, McClung, and Caire.
As a result, the women wo11 over-
all 6-3.

Senior Wortham commented.
“It is always great to beat Emory,
especially on their courts. They
are always a good team and we
have to come out ready to play. I
think everyone really focused on
their respective matches in dou-
bles and singles and we were able
to walk away with a great win.”

The Generals also played
against Sewanee over the break,
taking an extremely important
win over the Tigers.

In doubles, Applegate and Mc-
Clung, and Tabb and Wortham
won 8-1. The number 3 doubles
consisting of Bouret and Leah
Weston fell short to the Tigers.

In singles matches, the Gener-
als won four of the six contests.
Applegate, Wortham, Kelly Will,
and Caire all won in two sets. Mc-
Clung barely lost in a tie-breaker
during her singles match.

The following weekend, the
Generals were back at home for

the ODAC Championships. Dur-
ing the tournament, the women
did not lose one match.

First to fall to the Generals was
Sweet Briar College. Every dou-
bles game ended in a score of ei-
ther 8-0 or 8-1. The singles games
were all won in two straight sets
— most 6-0, 6-0.

The next day, the Generals

. took on Hollins and again notched

a 9-0 win.

Applegate and McClung won
their doubles match with a score
of 8-2. The other two doubles
teams of Tabb and Wortham, and
Weston and Will defeated their
opponents by a score of 8-0.

In the singles matches, the
women again won almost every
game to end the day with a 9-0

victory.

The last day of the tourna-
ment, the women played against
Virginia Wesleyan.

All three doubles teams won in
convincing fashion.

In singles, Virginia Wesleyan
was also swept with victories from
Applegate (6-0, 6-0), Wortham
(6-0, 6-0), Tabb (6-2, 6-0), Mc-
Clung (6-0, 6-0), Will (6-0, 6-1),
and Caire (6-0, 6-0).

As a result, the Generals won
ODACs and automatically re-
ceived a bid to the D-III NCAA
Tournament.

After this win, Wortham re-
ﬂected, “I think our goals for
ODACS is to win at every posi-
tion, and we made sure that we
accomplished this goal. Winning

ODACs was a good end to our
spring break and a good way to
kick off our post-season.”

As the Generals look ahead
to NCAAs, they continue to dili-
gently practice in hopes of win-
ning the national title this May.

“I think we all know what we
need to do in order to be success-
ful” said Wortham.

“Since tennis is a team sport
that focuses on the results of in-
dividuals, we are all working on
various aspects of our singles and
doubles games so that we can start
off strong at regionals,” Wortham
said. “I think we’re trying to just
take it a match at a time and try-
ing to make sure that we come out
playing our very best tennis and
peak at the appropriate time.”

It has been over a year since 16-year-old Lexington resident Charles Volpe drowned underneath the darn at Jordan’s Point after heing swept over the edge by a strong cur-
rent. Now Dylan Fitzgerald, one of Volpe’s friends, is planning a permanent memorial to honor Volpe and other peple who have drowned at Jordan’s Point over the years.

Local teen plans memorial for friend

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

A year after local teenager Charles
Volpe drowned at the Jordan’s Point dam,
one of his friends is planning a permanent
memorial.

“I was good friends with Charles.
 I’d see him at the skate park” Dylan
Fitzgerald said. “After Charles died, Mr.
Volpe said he didn’t want him to be for-
gotten.”

Fitzgerald and Volpe became friends
because their mothers were friends.

As a memorial to Volpe, Fitzgerald
wants to plant several river trees and two
large beds of wildﬂowers. He also wants
to move a park bench honoring Volpe up
to the overlook of the darn that the city is
ﬁnishing up.

Volpe was 16 years old when he went
swimming in the Maury River on the af-
temoon of Sunday, April 23, 2006. Volpe
and his friend Bryc Talley were both swept
over the dam. Talley was able to escape
the undercurrent, but Volpe could not.

Rain storms earlier that week made the
normally placid current swift and deep.
Volpe drowned within an hour of the riv-
er’s peak discharge that day.

Volpe was the fourth person since 2003
to drown in the Maury River near the park
at Jordan’s Point.

A member of Lexington’s Boy Scout
Troop 5, Fitzgerald is also using the proj-
ect to fulﬁll one of the ﬁnal requirements
for Eagle Scout, the highest rank attain-
able in Scouting.

Fitzgerald has been working closely
on the memorial plans with Charles Vol-
pe, Sr. and Bill Blatter, the Lexington City
Planner. Blatter has been incorporating

those plans into an ongoing renovation of
the Jordan’s Point Park. If the overhaul
is completed as planned, the park will
get permanent restrooms, an informa-
tion kiosk and new paving for the park-
ing lot. The city also hopes to reconnect
the Woods Creek Trail with the Chessie
Trail.

“If we were done with everything in
two years, I’d feel great,” Blatter said.
“We’ll see if we have enough money to
get everything done.”

Blatter said that most of the construc-
tion is being completed with grant mon-

‘G
about people being on the darn.”

In years past, people would jump off
the darn into the water below, often diving
or trying to do ﬂips off the dam. The dam
is owned by the city, and city law prohib-
its anyone from being on the dam. Any-
one seen on the dam would be charged
with trespassing and ﬁned.

Crowder said his officers drive through
the park regularly, both to check on swim-
mers and to watch for underage drinking
in the park. When Volpe drowned last
year, Crowder was in charge of coordinat-
ing the emergency response effort. It took

“I was good friends with Charles... I ’a’ see him at
the skate park. After Charles died, Mr Volpe said he

didn ’t want him to be forgotten. ’

ey the city has received. Upkeep of the
park and Fitzgerald’s proposed memorial
would be handled by the city.

Lexington Police Chief Steve Crowder
said Blatter has worked hard to serve as a
liaison between city and Volpe’s family.

Fitzgerald said local teens still swim at
Jordan’s Point, but he said they are more
careful in the water.

“People are more aware of [the dan-
ger],” he said.

Crowder said his department has no-
ticed safer behavior down at J ordan’s
Point.

“To my knowledge, since this hap-
pened we have not had any complaints

a team of divers and search dogs nearly 24
hours to recover Volpe’s body.

While Fitzgerald plans his permanent
memorial, the city is left to ponder the
dam’s long term future. Both Fitzgerald
and Volpe Sr. told a city council meeting
last June that they thought the dam should
be destroyed. ‘

Volpe did not return several calls to his
office.

Blatter said the city will continue to
consider the dam’s future during the next
year.

“We’re about to consider options,” the

planner said. “We acknowledge the need
to be careful down there.”

Blatter said the city would need to
consider the impact, difficulty and cost
of any proposals to dismantle the dam.
He also said the city would encourage a
“community dialogue” before taking any
action.

In an interview last year, City Man-
ager Jon Ellestad said the dam no longer
serves any purpose. He said that dams
like the one at Jordan’s Point were put in
the river to help barges travel upstream.

There are hundreds of low head dams
across the country, and many of them no
longer serve any purpose. Though the
small dams do not look dangerous, their
design can create a deadly undertow that
can trap a person under the dam.

After Volpe’s deathb the city installed
a series of buoys above the dam. The
buoys were attached to shore by a cable
that was designed to separate if the wa-
ter level rose too high after a heavy rain-
storm upstream.

But during a recent ﬂood, the cable
failed to work as designed, and the city

had to remove the wrecked buoys. Blat-
ter said the city is trying to ﬁnd other
ways to reinstall the warning system.

There are also several signs warning
people to use caution when swimming
near the dam. Many swimmers now go
into the river further upstream from the
dam instead of right above it.

Crowder said he hopes people have
learned from the tragedy.

“It’s a shame bad things have to hap-
pen before things like this are recog-
nized,” he said. “Even though it’s a trag-
edy, we have to learn from it.”

Faculty reevaluate W&L’s core

Incoming Class of 201 1 must satisfy new FDR requirements

By Grace Wang
STAFF WRITER

The 2007-2008 academic year will
mark Washington and Lee’s introduction
to the new Foundation and Distribution
Requirements (FDRs). Applicable only
to the Undergraduate Class of 2011 and
beyond, the FDRs will replace the Gener-
al Education Requirements, which were
established in 1984.

Scott Dittman, the University Regis-
trar, said the change from GEs to FDRs
resulted from a need to review and revisit
the common, thought-provoking experi-
ence shared by all W&L students. The
primary goals were to reduce the overall
proportion of core requirements to total
number of credits needed to graduate as
well as encourage student exploration.

Dittman stated that this change was
not imposed by the administration, but
rather led by the faculty.

He explained that the faculty deliber-
ated over the changes through a number
of different committees, including a GE
Review Steering Committee, co-chaired
by Michael Evans and Robert Strong,
two faculty members, and a GE Commit-
tee, headed by Provost H. Thomas Wil-
liams. The proposed changes were then
voted on by the entire faculty, with a ma-
jority of 51% in favor needed.

In addition, these faculty committees
discussed ideas for new developments
in the curriculum, including freshman
seminars and the Spring Option. Both of
these developments are currently being
exercised.

The idea for freshman seminars came
through Dean Hank Dobin. As Associ-
ate Dean at Princeton University, Dean
Dobin led the freshman seminar pro-

gram.

The Spring Option recognizes that
W&L students of all undergraduate years
may want to start their summers early to
volunteer, work, study for major exami-
nations, or travel. Should students opt
for the Spring Option, they will not have
to enroll in spring term classes and are
still considered full-time students.

In addition, the Spring Option beneﬁts
faculty members by decreasing teaching
load during the academic year through
the reduction of students studying on
campus during the Spring Term.

Other ideas raised during the faculty
committee meetings, such as the “I” (In-
terdisciplinary, Internships, Interactive)
and Cultural attendance requirements,
were supported by some of the faculty,
discussed extensively, but not included in
the ﬁnal proposal.

The “I” requirement would have re-
quired students to take one or several
classes in the interdisciplinary studies,
such as Women’s Studies, African Amer-
ican Studies, or the Poverty and Human
Capability Studies as well as engage in
internships.

The Cultural Requirement aimed to
increase W&L students’ cultural aware-
ness and would have required students
to attend a number of concerts, lectures,
and other similar events throughout the
academic year.

Domnica Radulescu, Professor of
Romance Languages, was a particularly
strong proponent of the “I” requirement.

The new FDRs are comprised of both
Foundation requirements, measured by
proﬁciency in writing, foreign language,
mathematics or computer science, and
physical education, and Distribution re-
quirements, which explore more deeply

various academic disciplines.

The requirements for the writing,
foreign language, and mathematics and
computer science sections have stayed
the same while the number of required
Physical Education skills courses has
dropped from ﬁve to four. Swimming
proﬁciency is still required.

The Distribution Requirements con-
sist of those in arts and humanities and
those in sciences and social sciences.

and Religion, and other similar courses.
Now, only three credits (one class) from
among history, philosophy, religion, and
a couple other class options from other
departments are required.

Dr. Richard Bidlack of the History
Department does not believe this de-
crease in required humanities credits
will be beneﬁcial to students. He said,
“To better understand the origins of the
most vexing and explosive problems in

“In the new curriculum, the total number of cred-

its needed to graduate will decrease by six 0’rom
121 to 115); however: the number of credits in
FDRS (formerly, general education requirements),
which account for fewer than half of the total

credits, drops by twelve. ”

RICHARD BIDLACK, Associate Professor of History

Literature has now been categorized
as a section of the arts and humanities
Distribution Requirement, and only one
such course is required, instead of the
two required under the former Genera-
tion Education Requirements.

In addition, all incoming freshmen are
now required to take at least one class in
the ﬁne arts and can choose from clas-
sics, art, theater, and music.

In addition, under the GE system, stu-
dents were required to take twelve cred-
its from Fine Arts, History, Philosophy,

our world, I feel that our students should
be encouraged to devote more time, not
less, to the study of history, philosophy,
and religion, especially of those people
whom we poorly understand.”

The requirements for science and
mathematics have not changed. Math-
ematics/computer science proﬁciency, a
four-credit laboratory science, and an ad-
ditional mathematics and science course
chosen from select biology, chemistry,
computer science, engineering, geology,
mathematics, and physics classes are still

required.

Conversely, the requirement for social
sciences has dropped from nine credits,
or three courses, to two courses. Incom-
ing freshmen now pick two classes from
a selection of ﬁve areas including eco-
nomics, politics, psychology, anthropol-
ogy, and environmental science/joumal-
ism to satisfy this requirement.

Bidlack believes that the decrease in
F DRs from GEs is disproportionately
large to the decrease in total credits re-
quired to graduate. He said, “In the new
curriculum, the total number of credits
needed to graduate will decrease by six
(from 121 to 115); however, the number
of credits in F DRs (formerly, general ed-
ucation requirements), which account for
fewer than half of the total credits, drops
by twelve.

“As I understand it, FDRs were re-
duced by a disproportionately large num-
ber, in part because that is what our peer
institutions are doing. Also, the faculty
seemed to want to give students more
choice in selecting the subjects they
study,” he said.

Dalena Moser, a freshman from
Rochester, MN, believes the new FDR
requirements are a positive improvement
to the curriculum.

She said, “Now, most of our freshman
and sophomore years are spent trying to
ﬁll GEs and then junior and senior years
are spent working on our major. It is hard
to ﬁnd time to take classes that you are
interested in if they don’t ﬁt into one of
those categories.”

She added, “I know the beneﬁts of
a liberal arts college are experiencing
many different academic areas, but I feel
that the FDRs still require enough variety
without being overbearing.”

Lexingtorfs dam problem

lt’s business as usual these days on
the Maury River.

One year after we reported on the
death of local teenager Charles Volpe,
the city has still not done enough to
improve safety at the Jordan’s Point
dam. .

The Lexington Police Department
patrols down there more often these
days, but those officers can’t provide
constant surveillance. The city set up
a line of red buoys above the darn, but
they washed away after a heavy rain-
storm.

So the only real safety measures
in place are some new warning signs
and one ﬂoating buoy right above the

dam.

That’s not enough.

Of course, people who swim and
canoe at .Iordan’s Point need to take
some responsibility for their own safe-
ty. And it looks like people—for the
most part—Aarc doing that. Swimmers
are staying away from the dam and
swimming further upstream.

On a normal day, the likelihood
of someone being accidentally swept
over the dam is low. But as long as the
dam remains in place, there’s another
accident waiting to happen.

Charles Volpe was an expert swim-
mer and certiﬁed scuba diver, but that
was not able to save him when he went

over the dam last April.

City Planner Bill Blatter said the
city will soon begin considering the
dams long—term future. That discus-
sion needs to begin now.

While the city scrambles around,
trying to lure in the Museum of the
Confederacy, the dam sits at .lordan’s
Point, just as dangerous as it was last
spring.

The discussion on the dam’s future
really began last June, when Volpe’s
father delivered an impassioned plea
to the City Council, begging them to
remove the dam.

City Manager Jon Ellestad admit-
ted last year that the darn has no real

purpose.
Removing the dam would be ex-

pensive and difficult, but the city needs
to move ahead and take action.

The dangers of low head dams are
well-documented nationally. They’re
known as drowning machines.

It would be foolish to consider Vol-
pe’s death an unfortunate but isolated
incident. Less than two months after
Volpe drowned, a‘ canoe ,was swept
over the dam. Thankfully, nobody
was injured.

It’s time for the city to get seri-
ous about dealing with the dam. The
dam’s future must be decided before
another tragedy occurs.

Alternative Spring Break at successful urban schools shockingly disappoints

By Jess Steinmetz
c 0 L U M N IS T

I gi‘c':. up in a small town of 400
people in Northern California where
we have a bar, two fire stations and a
post ofﬁv.‘c. Since there are essentially
riojcb,  the area, the majority ofthe
residents are retired.

The only hope of having kids my
age in the neighborhood was if they
were visiting their grandparents for
the weekend. My town, for obvious
reasons, did not have its own school so
I was districted to attend the schools in
our neighboring town.

These schools feature an almost
sure chance of getting lice year after
year‘ and taking overcrowded classes
in the cafeteria.

My parents were not exactly pleased
with the less than stellar‘ record these
schools offered in terms of future high
school graduation and college gradu-
ation rates. They thus decided to send
me to private school.

My Catholic school was the bane
of my existence from kindergarten
through eighth grade. I quickly grew
sick of the uniforms, half a dozen
prayers throughout the day, mean
teachers, stuck-up students, and reli-
gion classes every day. I never could
quite understand why my second grade

teacher focused more on religion than
Englislr, history and nrath combined.

Despite my hatred of my school,
I always knew I had it much better
off than the public school nearest my
house.

My recent trip to"Philadelphia cori-
ﬁrrned how lucky I was to attend a
school where nearly all students would
graduate high school and many would
go to college.

I went on the Alternative Spring
Break trip to Philadelphia with 13
other Washington‘and Lee students.
Our focus was urban education, and
we went to three different schools over
the week.

We were told that the first school
we were to visit was very successful
and I had high expectations of what
this school was like for students. In-
stead, I was sorely disappointed, par-
ticularly in ternrs of the curriculum
and teachers.

on guns and gangs. I personally had a
hard time blaming them for not paying
attention, considering her lesson plans
were so boring I could have easily
fallen asleep.

llow can one expect students to be
engaged in their classes when their
teachers do not seem remotely inter-
ested in teaching their students?

The second grade teacher spent 75
percent of the day yelling and insult-
ing her students. She told me in the
front of the class that many of them
did not deserve to learn and should not
be helped.

What made the situation even
worse was that her students were not
'eing unruly. They were just being
typical second graders who began to
ﬁdget after being in the same seat for
hours on end.

Quality teachers are essential to
receiving an excellent education. In
my opinion, the teachers I observed

did not motivate their students or help
them excel in the classroom. Unfortu-
nately, this school failed to show me
that it is doing what is truly best for
its students.

L If this is what a “good” school in
Philadelphia looks like, what do the
“bad” schools look like?

While the people who went on the
trip with me were amazing and great to
hang out with, I cannot help but think
these were not the people who would
most beneﬁt from the trip. I feel it is
fair to say that we all agreed that the
education system in Philadelphia and
numerous other cities across America
desperately needs to improve.

At W&L, many people have been
fortunate enough to come from excel-
lent schools. Even though we are sur-
rounded by students who have come
from such schools, it’ is important to
take a step back and realize that this is
not the reality for others.

I sat in on the classrooms
of four different teachers
at this one school, none of
whom even slightly im-
pressed me.

The science teacher, for ’
instance, did not even try
to focus ‘the attention of her
students and just ignored
their constant discussions

joy of death
and dying

Including why we stop to

look at accidents, futile
attempts to be God, and
the erotic joy of taboos

By Daniel Mesonero Kromand
c o I. u M N l s T

*Disclaimer: The viewpoints in
this article are only those of the

author and the rest of Europe*

Last week I tried to add to the irony by
naming the article “you’re so prententious,”
but for journalistic reasons ‘my editors
changed it. This suits me ﬁne, as it means
I can focus on my rants and they’ll take
care of making it make sense. Well, back to
some serious critical theory.

Have you ever stopped to look at a par-
ticularly bloody accident and then won-
dered how come you are so sick? I don’t
have the answer to that, but luckily Georges
Bataille does.

First, though, we need to take a step
back. The premises for human existence are
that we come from continuous void (before
birth), live our lives as discontinuous be-
ings, and then return to the continuous void
(whether you call this heaven or not is, for
our existence, irrelevant).

When applying the term discontinuous
being, Bataille stresses the fact that no mat-
ter how much we reproduce, we—the be-
ing—will at some point cease to exist.

This rather unsettling thought causes”

Man to attempt a climb to the top of the
hierarchy, the top of the pyramid, which is
held by God (or whatever arbitrary word is
tied to his name).

Soon after, though, Man realizes that this
is a futile climb. So instead of attempting to
become continuous beings, we choose to
catch tiny glimpses of that inﬁnite.

These ﬂashes come in different pack-
ages according to the culture to which the
individual belongs. ~

Religious people seek in it in devotion,
inspirations, and divine ecstasies, the A2-
tecs sought it in human sacriﬁce, and most
modern people seek it in eroticism and oc-
casional drug use.

Bataille doesn’t equal all of these ecsta-
sies and actually claims that religious in-
spiration is more powerful and meaningful.
Yet they all are the result of the same search
of a glimpse of the inﬁnite, which is beyond
us in everyday life.

So to return to the situation where you
stop to observe the horror of an accident,
this is a situation with a high resemblance
to the sacriﬁces of the Aztecs.

Without bringing your own being in

danger of death, you are able to see another
individual who might be experiencing it and
thereby convey some information about the
inﬁnite. » '
Bataille also closely examines the ta-
boo, more speciﬁcally the joys we get from
transgressing taboos. Especially in eroti-
cism this plays an enormous role.

By transgression he means the voluntary
venture into forbidden territory but even
when the rules are broken they still stand,
for the participants are aware of the breach
and will soon return to the accepted behav-
ior while keeping the joy secret.

This fact may explain why we feel so
bad about enjoying other people’s misfor-
tune.

During the observance of the accident
everybody is captivated by the thrill of
death, but immediately afterwards we all
join in to lament the loss and thereby once
again reinforce the rules of acceptable con-
duct. The shame comes from the transgres-
sion of a taboo.

In today’s world where we’re all rela-
tively safe (except the unfortunate few who
die in trafﬁc or become victims of some
crime), we still feel as though doom is just
about to descend on us. Whether it’s in the
form of bird ﬂu, Ebola, SARS, terrorism,
or tsunamis, the world always seem to be
teetering on the edge of the abyss.

I subscribe this to a hidden desire, not to
actually see it happen, but rather to imagine
it happen. In our safety, which is unprec-
edented in the history of Man, we still have
the need for the occasional glimpse into the
continuum. Think about it.

Remembering the terrible tragedy

Survivor urges campus to prevent new Holocausts from occuring

By Jess Ramos
surr wmmz

Many people constantly forget things
in the Elrod Commons, like backpacks,
wallets, or books. However, the Com-
mons became a place last week to re—
member the Holocaust through many
forms, from ﬁlms to a survivor’s story.

Last week, Washington and Lee’s
Hillel chapter hosted the third annual
Holocaust Remembrance Week. Hillel
is a global organization that opportuni-
ties for Jewish students to celebrate and
preserve their Jewish identity.

On campus, Hillel has coordinated
other events, such as a Seder to cel-
ebrate Passover and monthly Shabbat
services. ,

As Hillel’s membership grows on
campus, the university has been work-
ing on plans to construct a Hillel House,
possibly near the comer of Washington
and Jelferson. '

According to freshman Stephanie
Dultz, Secretary of Hillel, the Holo-

Alums take Lex, W&L by storm

Rainy weather can ’t ruin weekend is party atmosphere

caust Remembrance Week was an event
to “reaffirm this horrible event. . .[and]
learn from the past.”

Among the highlights of this year’s
Holocaust Remembrance Week were
screenings of two acclaimed ﬁlms, “The
Last Days” and “The Pianist.” Shown
in the Commons Theater throughout
the week, these two ﬁlms represented
the Holocaust in memory.

On Wednesday, members of the
Washington and Lee community signed
a memorial scroll in the Commons for
Holocaust victims. In addition, par-
ticipants received a photograph of their
person and a memorial paper clip.

Dultz said the idea for paper clips
came from a documentary about a mid-
dle school class that conceptualized 6
million by collecting 6 million paper
clips.

An estimated six million Jews were
killed by the Nazis during the Holo-
caust.

Instead of only keeping paper to-
gether, the paper clips united the par-

“Hitler set me up for hope I should never have.  Goa’

sparea’ me so I can share my painful past. ”

IRENE ZISBLATT, Holocaust survivor

ticipants in solidarity this week.

Irene Zisblatt, a Holocaust survi-
vor, told on Thursday night “a story
we didn’t plan on telling.” Her coura-
geous story of survival is also featured
in one of the screened ﬁlms, “The Last
Days.”

In the concentration camps, Zisb-
latt saved her mother’s diamonds by
eating and retrieving them in her own
excretion. Despite the death and hate-
surrounding her, Zisblatt remained op-
timistic. “Hitler set me up for hope I
should never have,” said Zisblatt.

Eventually, American soldiers res-
cued Zisblatt and she soon moved to
America. Fifty years later, Zisblatt
shared her story and returned to the
camps on a divine mandate. “God

spared me so I can share my painful
past,” she said.

Zisblatt emphasized remembering
and learning from the Holocaust. “I
will not be silent or refuse to forget the
victims,” she said.

Because the current generation will
be the last to know Holocaust survivors
ﬁrsthand, Zisblatt implored the audi-
ence to remember the Holocaust. In
doing so, Zisblatt said, “you will not let
it happen again.”

Hillel collaborated with Washing-
ton and Lee’s Multifaith Council to
organize a Vigil against Oppression on
Tuesday. Led by the Director of Reli-
gious Life, Burr Datz, the vigil featured
poetry, readings, music, and moments
of silence.

The vigil was an opportunity to take
stand for “all those oppressed—all the
genocides in the world,” said Dultz.
“[There is a] holocaust still going on.”

Holocaust Remembrance Week
wrapped up with a Yom Ha Shoah ser-
vice led by Rabbi Treseder of Lynch-
burg.

Overall, Holocaust Remembrance
Week was successful. Though she
would have liked more attendance at
events, “we’ve made progress, deﬁ-
nitely,” said Dultz.

Dultz echoed Zisblatt’s emphasis on
remembering the Holocaust to prevent
a similar event from ever happening
again.

Like Zisblatt, Dultz emphasized
the current generation’s critical posi-
tion in remembering the Holocaust.
“Holocaust survivors are not going to
be around for much longer...its time
for the new generation to learn all we
can about it...[to] teach future genera-
tions.”

Graduates from 11 different classes braved
chancy weather to meet up with old friends
and be honored at Wahsington and Lee’s an-
nual alumni weekend.

Cars ﬂooded the streets of Lexington as
alums poured onto campus during the rain on
Friday. The somewhat dismal weather didn’t
stop visitors and students from donning sun-
dresses and plaid shorts, however, both on the
hill and at various Greek events.

Cars were packed into downtown, at times
turning Washington Street and the surrounding
blocks into a virtual parking lot.

Chief Steve Crowder of the Lexington Po-
lice Department said the biggest challenge his
officers had to deal with was the parking short-
age.

The university went all out for the occasion,
planning numerous receptions and parties.
Douglas W. Bostick, author of Memorializing
Robert E. Lee: The Story of Lee Chapel, gave
the keynote address at the Opening Assembly

and also signed books at the University Store
after his speech.

Recreational activities from golf to clay
shooting competitions were provided for alums
who wished to participate. Most academic de-
partments also offered open house sessions,
and the Language Department even sponsored
20-minute language classes.

Alums at the journalism open house seemed
as excited to see Melissa Cox, the department
secretary, as they were to see each other.

A barbecue bash was held at Zollman’s
Pavillion on Friday. Following the cookout,
transportation from campus was provided to
Zollman’s for Alumni Late Night, an event
that lasted until 1 am. On Saturday, the W&L
a capella groups General Admission, Jubilee
and Southern Comfort also held a showcase.
The weekend was capped off with the Harlem
Renaissance Ball at the Sheridan Livery on
Saturday evening.

Of course, the affects of alumni weekend
are felt most by W&L students in the realm
of Greek Life. Sororities held receptions for
alumni during the day on Saturday. Fraternities

across campus celebrated with cocktail parties,
barbecues, and bands such as Snackbar Jones.

Alumni turnout at the events varied, but
most alumni seemed energetic and happy
to be mixing with students. Visitor numbers
dwindled as the night wore on, but a few token
stragglers partied well into the night, even hit-
ting up events like Chi Psi’s Late Night.

‘ Student reactions to alumni weekend dif-
fered as well. “It’s one of the better weekends
we have during spring term,” says sophomore
David Stancyk.

Most undergrads attending parties on Fri-
day and Saturday night seemed to agree that
alumni weekend was fun although perhaps one
of the stranger weekends at W&L.

Not everyone was as enthusiastic, how-
ever. Undergrad junior Robert Walker said the
weekend would be more fun without the pres-
ence of alums.

Despite the few dissenters, both visitors and
students seemed to enjoy themselves through-
out the weekend. If nothing else, the event
gives frats yet another excuse to start partying
early during spring term.

Jan Hathorn gives the women’s lacrosse team helpful advice during halftime of
the ODAC Championship game against Roanoke (right). Hathorn and the Generals
celebrate their fifth consecutive ODAC Championship and the recognition of five
teammates as members of the All-ODAC Tournament team (above).

By Mike Huntress
STAFF WRITER

In Spring 1986, one-fourth
of the roughly 100 women who
constituted Washington and Lee’s
ﬁrst coeducational class would
gather and participate in women ’s
club soccer.

With 25 women gathering to
escape W&L’s overwhelmingly
male student body that hadn’t
lived side by side with women for
more than 200 years, the roots of
one of W& L’s ﬁrst women’s ath-
letic programs were laid. It was
far removed from the atmosphere
of competition and excellence
that now envelops W&L’s wom-
en’s athletics.

Jan Hathom would eventually
take that soccer program and also
the women’s lacrosse to such an
elevated position. In recognition
of not only her personal but also
all women’s success in athletics
since coeducation, W&L named
Hathom the university’s seventh
athletic director on April 24”‘.

Last week Hathom’s lacrosse
team beat Roanoke to capture a
ﬁlth straight ODAC conference ti-
tle as it ﬁnished the season ranked
20th in all ofDivision III. Success
on that level has become the norm
for Hathom’s program, which she
has been coaching since its incep-
tion in 1989.

That Hathom and her teams
would succeed and contribute to
the university as they have seems
natural to us now, but coeducation
occurred in the face of staunch
opposition.

Jonathan Westervelt Warner
(for whom the athletic center is
named) stepped down from his
position on the board of trustees
in 1984 as a result of his opposi-
tion to the decision to fully inte-
grate women into the undergradu-
ate program.

“I knew the process would
take time and there would be a
level of patience required,” said
Hathom about forging a women’s

. athletic program despite some

disapproval, “although I never
felt we didn’t get the recognition
we deserved.”

Hathom’s announcement as
athletic director isn’t the result’
of a new recognition of women’s
importance at W&L, but it is
symbolic of it. At a school where
almost every plaque or monument
of past glory is devoid’ of any
feminine inﬂuence, for the head
of the athletic department to be a
woman is a signiﬁcant event.

“I think it is symbolic of
[women’s importance in athlet-
ics],” said Hathom. “Now people
pay attention to every step of the
way. Whether it’s good or bad
we’re just like the men.”.

Hathom’s successes are nu-
merous and extensive. Follow-
ing her graduation from the State
University of New York at Cort-
land in 1982 where she played
lacrosse and basketball, she spent
ﬁve years at Denison University,
winning a conference title each
year.

Hathom was named the North
Coast Athletic Conference Wom-
en’s Lacrosse Coach of the Year
in 1987. She then came to W&L,
where she began coaching wom-
en’s soccer in 1987 and lacrosse
in I989. With the soccer team
she posted two ODAC champi-
onships and was twice named
the ODAC’s Coach of the Year
before stepping down in 2000 to
focus on lacrosse.

Her lacrosse teams have won
nine ODAC championships,
made eight NCAA appearances,
accumulated 274 victories—ﬁfth
highest all time for women’s la-
crosse coaches~—and Hathom has
won eight ODAC Coach of the
Year awards at the helm of the la-
crosse team.

With so many athletic deco-
rations it’s easy to see why Ha-
thom was considered among the
90 candidates who were applied
for the Athletic Director position;
however, those accolades don’t
quantify her most admirable attri-
bute as seen by her peers.

W&L’s men’s soccer coach
Rolf Piranian has the unique per-
spective of being a member of the
faculty both before and after co-
education. He coached the wom-
en’s club soccer team in 1985
and 1986 before Hathom turned
it into a varsity sport. In addi-'
tion, he graduated from W&L in
1974. Piranian thinks highly of
Hathom.

“She’s got a great sense of
Division III sports” he said. “It’s
not an end all; it’s a chance to
challenge kids. It’s not an end in
itself.”

Alongside coaches such as
Cinda Rankin, who similarly
developed W&L’s ﬁrst varsity
women’s tennis team, Hathom is
part of the vanguard of women
who helped change the culture of
women’s athletics at W&L.

“Twenty-ﬁve years ago wom-
en and their place in athletics was
relatively small in number and
not particularly celebrated,” said
Hathom. “Some of it was an eq-
uity issue and some is a cultural
acceptance level. Now it is cele-
brated to be an athlete and a good
athlete.”

The prevailing sense seems
to be that originally women were
just allowed to come and be part
W&L’s androcentric history. Now
they are regarded as the school’s
other vital half.

Piranian summed this up when
he said of women’s athletics over
the years, “Now it’s a different
mindset. Now it is win the ODAC
and go to nationals. Then it was
just giving them something to do.
It was about participation.”

In 2002 Warner donated $1
million in what was a very ex-
pensive acknowledgement of a
mistake. That donation is allotted
to go largely to women’s scholar-
ships as a result of his recognition
of how women strengthened the
university instead of weakening
it.

Credit women like Hathom,
the new athletic director, for mak-
ing that mistake abundantly clear.

Concluding
a career of
excellence

Jan Hathorn is the only coach that W&L is women is

tournament will mark her ﬁnal games on the sideline as she

Team ﬁghts hard but
comes up short in ODAC
tournament vs. Roanoke

By Brian Devlne
smrr wnmzn

The Old Dominion Athletic
Conference is traditionally a
stable of national contenders in
men’s lacrosse. The conference
tournament this week featured
four nationally ranked teams,
so it is no shame that the men
from Washington and Lee fell
by one goal in the semiﬁnals to
Roanoke College.

Entering the tournament
ranked No. 18 nationally, a spot
that might have given the Gen-
erals a top seed if they played in
a dozen other conferences, they
were handed the number four
seed and a Wednesday evening
contest against the Roanoke
Maroons, top-seeded and ranked
No. 11 in the country.

The game at RC’s Alumni
Field was a back-and-forth af-
fair, and no team led by more
than three goals from beginning
to end. Roanoke went up 3-1
early, but W&L rallied to level
at 4-4 midway through the sec-
ond period.

Three minutes later, the home
side was again up by three. This
pattern continued throughout
the contest as neither squad was
able to gain a decisive advan-
tage. The visiting Generals went
up 12-9 in the fourth quarter. the
ﬁrst time all evening that W&L
had led by more than one.

..play, however, the Maroons

showed that they deserved their
12-4 season record. Three unan-
swered goals in two minutes tied
the score at 12, where it would
remain into the dying moments.

Just as overtime seemed as-
sured, the Maro_ons went up a
man on a W&L penalty. Roa-
noke had been up a man four
times previously in the game
but had been denied goals each
time by goalkeeper Chris Lalli,
who recorded 10 saves. With
only 25 seconds remaining, RC
broke their luckless streak as

 

 

midﬁelder Chaz Carlson fed his
teammate Steve Furdock, who
beat Lalli for the winner.

Despite falling 13-12, the
Generals acquitted themselves
well in front of the Roanoke
fans. The Maroon, rightfully
considered the best team in
the ODAC, went on to win
Sunday’s championship game
against third-seeded and nation-
ally-ranked Lynchburg College.
Roanoke will represent the con-
ference in the NCAA touma-
merit.

The one goal difference
proved that W&L had the skill
to play with the conferences
top teams. Some doubted the
side’s ability to compete with
the likes of Roanoke, Lynchburg
and Hampden—Sydney after the
Generals lost 12-3 to Lynchburg
on Saturday April 28.

Lalli and his teammates
wanted to prove that that re-
sult was an aberration, not the
standard of play for the. team.
Leading the way for W&L was
sophomore midﬁelder Harry St.
John, who scored ﬁve goals on
the day to lead all players. three
of which were part of the Gen-
erals’ four-goal run in the fourth
quarter to go ahead 12-“).

enough to counter Roanoke‘s
triple-edged sword of Carlson,
Zach Thomas and Jon Mason,
who have combined for 123
goals and 86 assists this season
as of the ODAC championship
game.

The Generals’ defense held
Thomas and Mason to three

. goals each, but it was Carlson’s

game-winning assist with 25
seconds left that undid all of
the Generals’ solid, competitive

play.

The Washington and Lee
men’s tennis team came up short
in its bid to advance to the third
round of the NCAA team cham-
pionships on Saturday against
Johns Hopkins University. Com-
ing off their impressive victory in

the ODAC tournament, the men’s_

tennis team boasted a 20-2 record,
was ranked No. 20 nationally and
looked to advance deep into the
national tournament after receiv-
ing a ﬁrst-round bye.

Johns Hopkins, despite be-
ing ranked No. 13 in the country
and boasting a 17-2 record, was
forced to play a first round match
against 15-2 Messiah College.
Messiah proved to be no match
for the Blue Jays, and Hopkins
won easily, 5-0, and advanced to
the second round to play W&L.

The Blue Jays jumped out to
strong start by taking all three
doubles matches. Hopkin’s num-
ber one doubles team of Hillen
Smith, Jr. and Joe Vasoontara de-
feated W&L’s duo of juniors Tim
Ross and Stuart Sanford 8-3.

Senior Jon Malooly and soph-
omore Jamie McCardell fell to
Hopkins’ David Maldow and Dan
Myers by the same score in num-
ber two doubles. Freshmen Alex
Brooke and junior Seth Feibel-
man made a closer match, but ul-
timately fell to Matt Naftilan and
Rafael Roberti, 8-6, in number
three doubles.

In singles, Sanford recorded
the Generals’ lone victory by de-
feating Myers 6-0, 6-4, in number
four singles. However, in number
two singles Malooly lost to Va-
soontara 6-4, 6-2, and in num-
ber ﬁve singles McCardell lost
to Roberti 6-3, 6-4, to end the
match.

When the match ended, Fie-
belman had won the first set and
led 5-1 in the second over JHU’s
Larry Wei in number three sin-
gles.

Junior Nelson Bunn was up
a set on JHU’s Peter Vale but
trailed 5-6 in the second set in
number six singles. After losing
a close ﬁrst set 7-5, junior Tim
Ross trailed 5-0 in the second set
to JHU’s David Maldow in num-
ber one doubles.

Even though the season came
to an unhappy end, the Generals
have much to build on for next
season. Looking ahead, the only
senior competing for the Generals
in the national tournament was Jon
Malooly. In addition to winning
the ODAC tournament, W&L had
six individuals and one doubles
team honored as ﬁrst-team all-
ODAC as well as ODAC Coach
of the Year David Detwiler.

The Generals’ twenty wins this
season was the highest win total
ever, besting the previous record
set by the 1975 team which went
18-6.

with a 2:22.83 run in the 800 meter race.

In ﬁeld events, Doombos jumped 1.52
meters in the high jump and 5.20 meters in
the long jump. Lastly, she tossed the shot
put 9.14 meters and threw 24.94 meters
in javelin. Doombos will compete in the
2007 Division III Outdoor Track and Field
Championships at University of Wisconsin
— Osh Kosh on May 24-26.

Armstrong ﬁnished ﬁfth with a score of
3,461 in the Heptathlon.

“The competition was tough, running in
the rain and cold on the ﬁrst day, but it got
much better the second day. I was pleased
with how I high jumped and threw the shot
put and javelin.”

plechase on Thursday in a time of 12:02.92,
which is a record for W&L. '

“Winning felt great, but what I am es-
pecially proud of is being the ﬁrst female
athlete at W&L to compete in the steeple-
chase,” Taylor said.

She also said, “the steeple is a really
tough race, both physically and mentally.
If you don’t keep steady concentration and
attack each barrier, you could end up with
your face planted into the track. But at the
same time it is an extremely exciting and
ﬁin race. I feel a great sense of accomplish-
ment when I ﬁnish, knowing that I just ran
3000 meters and over 35 barriers.”

Taylor says she owes her success to her
coaches Kris and Nate Hoey. Hoey actually
ran this event in the Olympic time trials,

Con’i w iii for the full report.

and though she could not be there, was on
the phone with Nate Hoey to hear the play-
by-play.

“Yesterday was my last track meet for
the season, but I am hoping to come back
next year even stronger,” Taylor said.
“There is even talk of making the steeple
an ODAC event. And I am crossing my ﬁn-
gers that when our new stadium is built, it
includes steeple barriers and a water jump
pit.”

Webb was back in action after her record
breaking last weekend at ODACs. She ran
the 1500 meter race in a time of 4:46.80,
making her the ﬁrst D-III competitor in the
event to cross the ﬁnish line (she was 7th
place overall).

“The 1500 went pretty well. I dropped

about 3 seconds from my best 1500 time
this season (from 4:49 to 4:46), so I’m
pleased,” she said.

Webb said the competition was tough.
“The race went out really fast. I tried to stay
up with a group of Va Tech girls, but I just
couldn’t hold the pace.”

The winning time came in at 4:28.

Now, as Webb looks towards the end
of the season, she is hoping to drop more
time in order to qualify for nationals. How-
ever, Webb remains optimistic that if she
does not make nationals this year, she has
“two more years of solid training to try to
get there.”

The Generals have a week off before the
Lynchburg Last Chance Meet on Friday,
May 18.

to the quarterﬁ-

tories over No. 15

Swarthmore and
No. 10 Mary Washington. W&L
was selected as a host for ﬁrst
three rounds of the national play-
offs and received a ﬁrst-round
bye based on their No. 3 ranking
they compiled during the regular
season. ‘

In the ﬁrst round, Swarthmore
cruised past Cabrini College 5-0
to advance and face the Generals,
However, their ride through the
tournament came to a screeching
halt when they faced off against
the Generals.

The Generals got off to a
strong start by sweeping the dou-
bles competition. In ﬁrst doubles,
senior Emily Applegate teamed
with senior Kristen McClung to
defeated Swarthmore’s number
one duo of Sonya Reynolds and
Sara Sargent 8-3. Swarthmore’s
number two team of Marissa Mat-

thews and Erica Lukoski were
no match for W&L’s sophomore
Katie Tabb and senior‘ Ginny
Wortham, falling 8-2. In third
doubles, W&L’s pair of freshmen
Lauren Caire and junior Leah
Weston defeated Waverly Lutz
and Rachel Wallwork 8-4 to com-
plete the sweep.

In singles, the Generals
only needed to win twolof the
six matches to move on. After
Wortham defeated Reynolds 6-0,
6-0 and McClung beat Sargent
6-2, 6-1, the match was ended
because the Generals had already
locked up the victory. '

In the other four matches,
Tabb, junior Kelly Will, Weston,
and Caire had all won the ﬁrst set
and were leading or tied in the
second. With the victory, the Gen-
erals moved on to play the win-
ner of Johns Hopkins and Mary
Washington.

In the other second round
match on Saturday, Johns Hop-
kins came out strong against Mary
Washington by sweeping the dou-
bles matches by scores of 9-8, 8-
6, and 8-6, to take a 3-0 lead.

However, Mary Washington
stormed back, dropping only one
of six singles matches to steal a 5-

4 victory and advance to the third
round against W&L.

The Generals started strong in
the doubles matches again, with
the team of Applegate and Mc-
Clung defeating Mary Washing-
ton’s Stephanie Kurti and Becky
Morse—Karzen 8-3 in number
one doubles. Tabb and Wortham
teamed up to defeat Natalia Fu-
gate and Katie Miglin 8-1.

W&L looked like they would
sweep the doubles matches as
Caire and Weston jumped out to a
7-1 lead in number three doubles.
However, Mary Washington’s

Kate Malpeli and Stacey Rickard ‘

came alive and evened the match
at 7-7.

In the next game with Caire
serving, Caire and Weston held
off four break points before tak-
ing the game to go up 8-7.

After Mary Washington held
serve, the match went to a cru-
cial seven point tiebreak. The
momentum of the match hinged
on the outcome of the game. If
the Generals could hold on after
giving up their lead and sweep
the doubles matches, they would
need just two singles wins to ad-
vance to the quarterﬁnals but if
Mary Washington could pull off a

Though the ODAC season is
already over, the Generals Track
and Field team sent a collectionof
athletes to Lynchburg on Thurs-
day to compete at the Liberty
Twilight.

Sophomore Becca Taylor
competed in the 3000 meter Stee-
plcchase. Sophomore Liz Webb
ran the 1500 meter race. Vance
Berry, a sophomore, competed in
the 1500 meter race. And lastly,
Sophomore Stacy Doombos and
Freshman Sallie Armstrong com-
peted in the women’s Heptathlon.

Doombos said afterwards:
“The meet went really well and
was a lot of fun. I was really ex-

was only my second time doing a
Heptathlon. I was able to improve
on a few of my events and am
looking forward to competing in
another Heptathlon because there

stunning come-from-behind win,
they would have the momentum
to pull off another surprising
comeback in the singles.

Caire and.Weston got off to a
quick start, with Weston tallying
an ace and two winners before the
pair watched Mary Washington
double fault, giving the Generals
a 4-0 lead. Mary Washington won
three of the next ﬁve to bring the
score to 6-3, but an unforced er-
ror by the UMW duo on the next
point gave W&L the match.

In singles, McClung was the
ﬁrst one ﬁnished as she quickly
defeated Natalia Fugate 6-1, 6-0,
leaving the Generals one match
short of victory. Soon after, Tabb
ﬁnished off Miglin by the score of
6-2, 6-3, which gave the Generals
a 5-0 victory. Cheers erupted from
the other W&L players still play-
ing as the match was stopped.

In the other matches, Wortham,
Will, Weston and Caire had all
won their ﬁrst sets and were either
tied or leading in the second.

The Generals now advance
to the national quarterﬁnals held
at Mary Washington University
starting May 15. They will face

to aid the weak and poor

By Joel Poelhuis
STAFF WRITER

Bestselling author John
Grisham reminded graduating
law students of the social and
moral duties the legal profes-
sion entails at their commence-
ment Saturday morning.

“Legal aid is the last line
of defense for poor people and
those who are weak,” Grisham
said. “When that last line of
defense is breached we are all
diminished.”

The graduates entered the
ceremony to the strains of bag-
pipes as friends and relatives
scrambled to take pictures.

The air was heavy with
humidity from the previous
night’s storm, and attendees
fanned themselves with the
programs left on the seats.

Law dean Brian Murchi-
son introduced Grisham, who
practiced law in a small Mis-
sissippi town before writing
best-selling legal thrillers
such as The Pelican Brief, The
Firm, and The Brethren.

Rather than drawing on ma-
terial from his books, Grisham
emphasized the real-life prob-

gas after commencement,
said Grisham spoke about real
problems.

“What I liked best was how
he didn’t just say to be a good
person,” said Castleman. “He
gave examples of things to
do.”

Adam Hull, President of
the Student Bar Association,
described the speech as a kind
of “call to arms” for those pur-
suing the legal profession.

Hull said that Class of 2007
President Allison Langston
and Vice President Becca Staf-
ford started working early to
get a good speaker this year.

Langston said the process
began with an email sent out
to the student body asking for
suggestions about the speak-
er. Grisham’s name just kept
coming up.

“He was deﬁnitely our
number one choice,” Langston

. said.

- A group consisting of
Langston, Stafford, Murchi-
son, and Dean Sidney Evans
wrote a letter asking Grisham
to speak at commencement.

“Legal aid is the last line of defense for
poor people and those who are weak, ”
Grisham said. “When that last line of de-

fense is breached we are all diminished ”

JOHN GRISHAM, bestselling author
 

C lems facing many in the legal

system today.

He spoke of the poor, the
homeless, and the wrongfully
convicted. He spoke of public
service legal projects that are
“underfunded, understaffed,
and incredibly in need of
young people to volunteer.”

To illustrate his point,
Grisham told the story of a
homeless man named Cleve-
land who was stuck in a kind
of legal limbo. His lawyer,
who took his case pro bono,
tried to wade through the bu-
reaucracy to settle Cleveland’s
claim. The advocate requested
some documents and was get-
ting nowhere withthe claim
until he mentioned that he was
a lawyer. Suddenly, the bu-
reaucracy ﬁmctioned without
problem.

“When used properly, your
license to practice law is a
powerful tool,” Grisham said.

Grisham went on to speak
about his own pro bono work.
He recalled that many of it
wasn’t intended as community
service at ﬁrst, but impover-
ished clients could not pay.

“Looking back, those
are the cases I remember,”
Grisham claimed. “Those are
the moments in my career that
I truly felt needed.”

Charles Castleman, who
plans to practice in Las Ve-

Langston emphasized the
role the deans and Stafford
played in helping with the pro-
cess.

Grisham almost wasn’t the
commencement speaker, ac-
cording to Langston. After a
long period with no response,

, they were about to move on

to the second choice speaker
when they received a letter
from Grisham. Langston was
overjoyed.

“The threads of integ-
rity and justice [in Grisham’s
work] match'up with what
Washington and Lee is all
about,” Langston said.

She also saw common
themes between Grisham’s
commencement speech and
recent projects at the law
school.

The law school recently
started doing _casework for
the Innocence Project, which
Grisham mentioned several
times in his speech. The In-
nocence Project is a non-profit
organization devoted to free-
ing the wrongfully convicted.

Langston says her own ex-
periences and Grisham’s nov-
els have helped her realize the
power and responsibility that
can be a part of the legal pro-
fession. ,

“You can turn it around
for someone who otherwise
wouldn’t get help.”

spring dig loo

By Dane Davls and Grace Wang
STAFF WRITERS

Relics of Washington and Lee’s
long-standing history are currently
being unearthed by students of An-
thropology 377, Field Techniques in
Archaeology, right outside of New-
comb Hall. Led by Professors Ber-
nard Means and Laura Galke, students
have discovered exciting artifacts that
illuminate early W&L’s students’ day-
to-day lives.

“Our ﬁrst and primary objective of
the dig is to teach students the entire
process of archaeological excavation,
from working in the ﬁeld, through
processing of artifacts, to producing
a report on their wor ,” said Means,
a Visiting Assistant Professor of An-
thropology.

The class is investigating one of
the ﬁrst structures built on the Hill af-
ter Liberty Hall Academy, a precursor
of W&L located near the current soc-
cer ﬁelds, burned in 1803.

Two academic buildings, Graham
and Union Halls, were built on either
side of what is now Robinson and
Payne Halls on the Colonnade, and
were eventually replaced by two brick
dormitories. Today, Tucker and New-
comb Halls stand in these locations.

In excavating this site outside of
Newcomb Hall, both faculty and stu-
dents hope to shed light on past stu-
dent life. 4

“As part of our research, we are
trying to locate exactly where Union
Hall was and we are looking espe-
cially for artifacts associated with
student life -- since student life is not
mentioned in detail in official campus
records,” explained Means.

The anthropology class has been
digging Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays during spring term, and has
just ﬁnished its third week.

Artifacts found during the week
are processed on Thursdays and Fri-
days in the Anthropology Laboratory,
which is located on the back campus.

In addition, the class has engaged
in lectures led by experts in the ﬁeld,

such as Eliot Balazs, a general con-
struction contractor, Lisa Young, a
specialist in archaeological conser-
vation, and Dr. Michael Gregory, a
W&L alumnus.

This collaborative effort between
faculty and students began in 2005
and has continued this year.

Means said, “We ﬁrst dug here
in 2005 and returned in 2007, since
much of the area was actually un-
touched, even though our dig has a
big footprint!”

Students play a major role in the
excavation, incorporating both in-
formation they have learned in their
classroom lectures and hands-on ex-
perience.

Students were surprised to dis-
cover animal bones, ceramic rem-
nants, glass, as well as an abundance
of bricks.

The animal bones and ceramics
were particularly interesting to the
students because it was thought that
cooking within student dorms was
prohibited.

Galke, W&L’s Staff Archaeologist
and co-instructor of the class, said,
“This was a little unexpected, since
Lexington had dining establislnnents
and the college provided a ‘Steward’s
House’ or dining hall.”

Also fascinating to the researchers
was the presence of a pile of bricks
arranged in a diagonal line. This ar-
rangement of bricks challenged pre-
vious thought about the location of
Union Hall.

Means believes this was the most
challenging aspect of the excavation
thus far. .

He said, “The foundations we are
looking for are not quite where we
expected them based on historical re-
cords, but we do seem to be ﬁnding
them now. We also may have found
the base of a chimney used to heat the
dormitory.”

Galke also believes the diversity
of majors and undergraduate levels in
the class has been a challenge, but she
that she has learned to streamline how

she teaches archaeology to students.

Despite this, Means and Galke
have immensely enjoyed the opportu-
nity to work with their students.

Means said, “Student response has
been great. I think at least one more
student has decided to declare an An-
thropology/Archaeology degree than
we started with, and several want to
take more Anthropology classes in the
future.”

In addition, one of the dig students,
Elisa Turner, has obtained a Robert E.
Lee Grant with the help of Means, en-
abling her to build a website based on
this year’s spring dig.

Galke said, “I most enjoy the pro-
cess of discovering new aspects of
the University’s history alongside the
students. Together, we are excavating
an actual archaeological site that has
proven to contain information about
the daily lives of the students who
went here during the 1800s that was
previously unknown. None of us re-
ally know what the next bucket full of
soil will reveal.” '

Excited by the prospect of unearth-
ing the lives of W&L students from
another era, current students have ex-
hibited similar enthusiasm.

Edward Rider, a junior, said, “I
took the class because I heard great
things about it. Plus, it’s outside!”

When asked about what she will
take home from this class, both Brea
Phillips and Turner, Archaeology/An-
thropology majors, believe this class
holds practical applications for their
future careers.

Phillips said, “I’ve learned how to
excavate and work in labs, which will
be helpful after school.”

Turner believes the ﬁeld work has

“I am pretty sure I want to practice ar-

Reevaluate political labels

Even pro—life makes no sense. No sane person is against life.

By Abel Delgado
COLU M N I ST

Nicolas Sarkozy won the French

- election by promising sweeping, al-

most radical changes to the French
economy and way of life. They call
him a “conservative.” What exactly is
he trying to conserve?

Political labels “liberal” and “con-
servative" are far from useful in the
new world of politics and downright
misleading. We use them because
they’re easy. Labels portray certain im-
ages, and we seem not to care whether
or not those images are wrong.

When the term liberal ﬁrst arose, it
was used to describe people who want-
ed more freedom and for government
to have as little power as possible. But
now that sounds like what a traditional
conservative would want.

What those on the “right” would

label a “tax-and-spend liberal” is actu-
ally closer to a socialist than an actual
“liberal.” Europe actually has us beat
on this; socialists there aren’t afraid to
describe themselves as such instead of
using vague terms like “the left” or in-
accurate ones like “liberal.”

Another word for what we’d call
a “liberal” today is what should be
called a “progressive,” which would
be the opposite of a “conservative,”
who would want things to stay as they
are. But “progressive” is rarely used
because you can ﬁnd many people in
both major political parties who would
fall under that label, so it gets too com-
plicated for pundits to understand and
explain.

Going back to “the right” and label-
ing, why are those who favor outlaw-
ing abortion automatically put into the
category of “the right?” The left-right
spectrum of labeling is supposed to
be based on economic principals, not

when you think life ends and begin.
Religious beliefs should have little ef-
fect on economic ones. If people are
religious wouldn’t you expect them to
favor economic programs that help the
poor? Not in this country.

If there are any labels we need to
retire, they are the “pro-life“ and “pro-
choiee” labels. No sane person is actu-
ally against life, they just have a dif-
ferent idea of what life means. Nor is
any reasonable person against women
“choosing"; they just don‘t think that
certain things are up to choice. Using
either of these labels to describe your-
selfirnplies that those who believe dif-
ferently than you are against what you
are “pro.” That. as has been proven
time again, leads to absolutely no pos-
sible resolution.

The “neo-con” is my favorite mis-
nomer. l have no idea how radically
new thinking individuals can be con-
sidered “conservative" just because

their economic views are almost to
the right of Adam Smith. These people
want to completely change the world,
for better or worse, and yet they’re
“conservative.” This would only make
sense to the pundits who get paid to
talk about politics on TV and radio.

Mislabeling is an international
trend apparently. People call the Ven-
ezuelan government “populist” while
it’s pushing the countriy’s workers and
students to spend an hour a day study-
ing Trotsky. President Chavez for his
part calls his socialist ideas a “Bolivar-
ian Revolution,” naming it after a rich
noble who had nothing to do with so-
cialism or the lower class. How about
we call a spade a spade and a commu-
nist a communist?

Politicians should start labeling
themselves correctly and demanding
they be labeled more accurately. Who
knows, maybe that way we could actu-
ally know who we are voting for.

 

Professor

himself

Credits cut from
the humanites were

incorrectly listed but are

still disproportionate

I wish to commend staff writer Grace
Wang for her comprehensive and bal-
anced article on FDR requirements in
the revised curriculum, which was pub-

lished in the May 7 issue of the Phi.

I need, however, to correct informa-
tion that I furnished to Ms. Wang for the

article.

In backing up the assertion that the
reduction in the number of credits in
FDRs was disproportionately large, I
stated erroneously that they were to be
cut by twelve from the current general-
education requirements. The correct
number is nine. Required credits in the
combined areas of literature, ﬁne arts,
history, philosophy, and religion (plus a
few courses from other disciplines) will
be reduced by six; required credits in

When you have two articles left in
your illustrious career as a spring term
Phi writer, you are faced with a choice:
what theorist is suitable to deliver the
ﬁnal bang, and - far worse — which
ones do you cut out.

Should you describe your ﬁrst love
affair with radical theory and German
anarchism in the form of Max Stimer,
or perhaps choose the power-couple of
Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe,
whose main work is titled something

as un-American as Hegemony and So-

cialist Strategy?

lnstead I have chosen something
that has a slight chance of resonating
with you, my dear reader: the recently
deceased Jean Baudrillard.

Coming out of the tradition of Emile
Durkheim and Georges Bataille, Bau-
drillard has written a number of books
on the subject of mass communication

Majority, and The Gulf War didn't take
place.

According to Baudrillard the mod-
ern society has lost the reciprocal
human relation, mainly through the
spread of mass communication.

Where humans used to relate phys-
ically to all aspects of their lives, we
have now become individualized and
detached.

We receive our news completely
alone.

The mundane world has complete-
ly conquered the spectacle and the “sa-
cred” and instead replaced them with
the non-event.

The “sacred” is the events where
a group of humans transcend the pro-
fane world and perform a ritual, as in
religious gatherings.

According to Baudrillard these
don’t exist anymore as everything

We don’t truly know if anything
is really happening, but are left to the
non-events of the news.

Baudrillard calls it “the explosion
of information, and the implosion of
knowledge” because everyday we are
bombarded with developing stories on
CNN that are empty of meaning.

The world becomes hyper-real in
the sense that we can see and experi-
ence things that are impossible and is
described as “obsccne".

Everything becomes pornography
as we get close-ups and resolutions
that are beyond reality. We are per-
mitted into societies and situations in
which we have nothing invested.

I, for example, have experienced
a hundred divorces already through
movies and all of us first lost our vir-
ginity on the screen.

Technological fascination keeps

Baudrillard got especially in the
spot light when he claimed the 9/ 11
attacks were the return of the event,
of the “sacred”. This was a singular-
ity that suddenly meant something and
a complete reversal of the Western
Power.

Needless to say, Baudrillard wasn’t
the most popular man around, for a va-
riety of reasons:

First of all, his style is excessive
and poetic, which doesn’t ﬁt in well
with the academics. Second, all of his
statement are unbacked and exagger-
ated, a strategy on his part.

Baudrillard believed that theory
is meant to challenge reality, not de-
scribe it, for once a theory is generally
accepted is disappears and is now a
part of contemporary society.

Pushing reality to the extreme is
the job of the theorist.

the social sciences lowered by three.

This mistake on my part does not al-
ter the fact that the cuts were dispropor-
tionate (especially in the humanities) be-
cause the total number of credits needed
to graduate was cut by only six, and
FDR credits account for less than half
of the total. In light of the fact that the
required “core curriculum” will shrink
for members of the incoming class of
2011, I do hope that they and those who
follow them will use their electives to
broaden their horizons and acquire a di-

verse, well rounded education.

Sorting out the Democratic candidates

The Democratic Presidential race heats up with eight candidates in the ring,
but the big three is popularity is apparent in polls and fundraising contributions

ByWes Llttle
COLUMNIST

*Editor’s note.‘ Wes Little is
the political chairman for the
2008 Mock Convention. *

With Spring Kickoff coming
soon, I would like to give you a
clearer picture of what is happen-
ing in the Democratic Presidential
race our Convention will focus on
correctly forecasting.

I will be back soon with an
analysis of the Republican race,
and I appreciate any questions/
comments you might have on my
views.

These past few weeks have
been busy ones in the race for
the 2008 Democratic presidential
nomination.

The diverse group of seven
Democratic contenders has been
traveling across the nation to raise
funds and build support for their
candidacies.

These efforts are being reﬂect-
ed by the many changes we have
seen in each candidates stand-
ings in the polls and the amount
of money they were able to raise
in the ﬁrst quarter of this year.

These two pieces of informa-
tion have given us new insight
into the current status of the Dem-
ocratic race.

Using these statistics and gaug-
ing each candidate's independent
momentum in the important states
of Iowa, New Hampshire, South
Carolina and Nevada, the “stand-
ings” of the Democratic race be-
come clearer.

l. Sen. Hillary Clinton
The former First Lady and cur-
rent senator from New York pos-

Senators Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama,
and John Edwards lead in the big three
while others try to thrust themselves into

the Democratic presidential spotlight.
 

sesses several huge advantages in
this race: an experienced team of
loyal advisors, a huge and dedi-
cated fund-raising base, and the
support of one of the most popu-
lar Democrats alive, her husband.

Clinton is currently leading
most national polls with about 34
percent and led all Democratic
candidates by raising $26 million
in the ﬁrst quarter of this year.

2. Sen. Barack Obama

What this young Illinois sena-
tor lacks in experience and cam-
paign infrastructure is far exceed-
ed by his phenomenal speaking
gifts, personal dynamism and
ability to connect with voters
across the political and economic
spectrum.

He proved his draw from di-
verse people with his surprisingly
large $25 million fund-raising
haul in the ﬁrst quarter of this
year from an incredible 83,000
contributors.

Obama is presently polling
slightly behind Clinton nation-
ally, with about a 28 percent share
of the Democratic electorate.

3. Sen. John Edwards

Rounding out the “big three”
candidates, Edwards has succeed-
ed in gaining the support of many
Democrats through his populist

message, which will likely play
well in Iowa, a state where many
polls ﬁnd him ahead of the com-
petition.

Edwards’ popularity is evi-
denced by his healthy poll num-
bers in the low teens and his
successful efforts in raising $14
million this quarter.

4. Gov. Bill Richardson

The former ambassador to
the UN. and current governor of
New Mexico has the best resume
in the race and needs to perform
well in the upcoming debates in
order to move into the “ﬁrst tier”
and increase his chances of be-
coming the nation’s ﬁrst Hispanic
president.

Despite Gov. Richardson’s
struggles to ﬁnd any traction in
national polls (usually receiving
only 2-4 percent), he led the “sec-
ond tier” in fund-raising with $6
million and is seen as the stron-
gest challenger to Clinton, Obama
and Edwards.

5. Sen. Joe Biden

If this veteran senator from
Delaware can avoid his seem-
ingly constant gaffes and political
missteps, his extensive national
security credentials might gain
him attention in this race.

However, Biden raised a rath-

er unimpressive $3 million and
usually manages only 1 percent
in polls.

6. Sen. Chris Dodd

This Connecticut senator des-
perately needs a string of good
press or strong fund-raising to
keep his campaign from becom-
ing irrelevant.

While Dodd raised a respect-
able $4 million, he is virtually
unknown to the American people
and will most likely stay that
way.

7 & 8. Rep. Dennis Kucinich and
Sen. Mike Grave

Both this liberal Ohio repre-
sentative and former Alaska sena-
tor have already become irrel-
evant and both failed to raise any
signiﬁcant amount of campaign
cash.

Student volunteers excite the
montessori school children
with afternoon puppet festival

By Jess Ramos
STAFF WRITER

Colorful puppets and chil-
dren’s smiles shone bright at the
Children’s Puppet Festival held at
Washington and Lee University
last Saturday.

Woods Creek Montessori
sponsored the puppet festival as a
fundraiser and part of its ongoing
15“‘ anniversary celebration.

Following Dr. Maria Montes-
sori’s philosophy, Woods Creek
Montessori seeks to recognize
and respect the human personal-
ity in each child.

Since 1992, the Montessori
school has provided an alterna-
tive source of early education for
Rockbridge-area children.

The festival featured a range
of activities for children between
the ages of two and eight, from
making their own puppets to face
painting.

Brightly colored tents and bal-
loons amidst ch.i1dren’s laughter
on Cannan Green created a fun
and whimsical atmosphere for the
participants.

Stackhouse Theater became an
African jungle for the aﬂemoon
when Barefoot Puppets, a Rich-
mond-based puppet company,
performed adaptations of West-
African folktales.

Children and parents enjoyed
puppet performances of two

Ashanti folktales, “Tug-of-War”
and “A Story, A Story.” Using
humorous puns and rod puppets,
Barefoot Puppets entertained the
audience members.

The ﬁrst performance, “Tug-
of-War,” is about a hippopota-
mus and an elephant engaged in a
battle of wits. “A Story, A Story”
follows the spider Anansi as he
obtained a box of stories from the
Sky-God.

motional video for the school,
intended for potential applicants.
“It’s a good connection too——a lot
of the students do work with us,”
said Sullivan.

Recently, on Nabors’ Spring
Service Day, members of the Na-
bors Service League made pup-
pets that were used in the festi-
val.

In addition to hosting the festi-
val, W&L students helped coordi-

  
  
  
   
   
   
    

“Its been exciting. All the kids have been
interesting.  Its for a good cause. ”

GOZI EGBUONU, Class of 2010

Though the festival was origi-
nally for young children, plenty
of W&L students who are young
at heart came out as well.

Jessica Sullivan, Woods Creek
Montessori Administrative Assis-

tant, was greatful for W&L’s in—.

volvement in the Children’s Pup-
pet Festival. “It’s so great to have
[W&L] students helping out.”

Sullivan highlighted W&L’s
continuing partnership with
Woods Creek Montessori. Ac-
cording to Sullivan, many W&L
faculty enroll their young chil-
dren at the school.

Also, W&L journalism stu-
dents previously created a pro-

nate outdoor craft and facepaint-
ing stations and then helped clean
up afterwards.

Freshman Gozi Egbuonu oper-
ated the face painting station. “lt’s
been exciting,” she said. “All the
kids have been interesting.”

Woods Creek Montessori con-
tacted her sorority, Pi Beta Phi,
about volunteering, and Egbuonu
decided to volunteer. “It’s for a
good cause,” she said.

The Children’s Puppet Fes-
tival was a success, according
to Sullivan and Egbuonu. “lt’s a
good way to raise money—it lets
the kids have fun while helping
the school,” said Egbuonu.

Women’s Tennis three wins from title

Continued from page 6

If the Generals defeat Middlebury on Tuesday, they will take on
the winner of the Pomona-Pitzer/Williams quarterﬁnal. W&L faced
both schools at the Fab Five Tournament in San Antonio earlier in the
season, but with drastically different results. After defeating Pomona-
Pitzer 8-0 on the ﬁrst day of the tournament, the Generals suffered their
only defeat of the season to the Ephs of Williams, 5-4. Last season,
the Generals defeated Williams 5-0 in the quarterﬁnals of the NCAA
tournament.

Of the teams on the other side of the bracket that the Generals could
face in the ﬁnals, W&L has played half. The Generals defeated Denison
8-1 at home early in the season and won on the road against Sewanee
6-3 in the middle of April. The Generals did not play Amherst or Gus-
tavus Adolphus this season. Perennial rival, Emory University, lost in
the third round to Sewanee, and No. l DePauw lost to Denison, also in
the third round.

If the Generals are able to win three more matches, they would join
the 1988 men’s tennis team as just the second W&L team to bring home
a national title.

After just missing winning
the ODAC Championship, the
men’s golf team still held out
hope that they would receive
an at-large bid to the national
tournament. When the selec-
tions were released on May 7,
the team was left on the outside
looking in. However, junior Na-
thaniel James was one of ﬁve
players selected as an individual
to compete at the tournament.

In order to determine the
ﬁeld, the selection committee
ﬁrst determines which teams
will compete. Twenty-four
teams of the 35 team ﬁeld are
automatically chosen based on
winning a conference champi-
onship. The next eight spots are

_ reserved for teams that are either

true independents or playing in a

said.

“This year we started earlier
with new events like the 100 hur-
dles, javelin, and the shot. Since
I have always done so many dif-
ferent events, I always thought it
would be fun to try.”

In addition to improving in
every event from her decathlon
at Liberty, Doornbos set heptath-
lon personal records in all four
of the ﬁrst day events.

She ran the 100m hurdles in
16.24 seconds, cleared 5’1” in
the high jump, threw the shot put
just over 31 feet, and ﬁnished the
200m dash in 26.17 seconds.

On day two, Doombos long
jumped over 17 feet and threw
the javelin over 84 feet, which

conference that does not receive
automatic bid. That leaves only
three spots for teams who did not
win their conference title. This
year those spots were taken by
Oglethorpe, McMurray, and Il-
linois Wesleyan.

Only after completing the
selection of the teams does the
committee look at individual
players.

“The selection process for
Nationals is pretty complicated
as far as I can tell,” said James.

“They chose the best ﬁve in-
dividuals whose teams had not
been chosen. I think they look
primarily at scoring average and
head to head records against oth-
er players.”

Joining James as an indi-
vidual will be ODAC rival Bob
Boykin of Hampden-Sydney.

' The national tournament
is different because there is a

gave her a chance to jump up
the national performance list if
she could run a fast 800. Several
teammates came out to cheer
her on as she ran the 800m in
2:22.22.

“I really am enjoying all of
the events and don’t really have
a least favorite,” said Doombos.
“I am really enjoying the 800,
100 hurdles, shot put, and jave-
lin, since they are all new events
for me, so each time I am getting
more experienced and better at
them. Then the long jump, high
jump, and 200 are events I have
always done, so I really enjoy
those as well.”

Though the oﬂicial selections
will not be announced until Sun-

much larger ﬁeld than any of the
regular season events. With 180
players, the event is about twice
the size of the average regular
season tournament. Even though
the tournament is similar in for-
mat to the regular season because
it uses four rounds of stroke play,
there is a out after round two
which reduces the ﬁeld to the top
17 teams and ﬁve individuals.

“There is a little more pres-
sure associated with a touma-
ment of this size,” said James.
“However, for me anyway, most
of the pressure comes during the
regular season as we are trying
to make it to the NCAAS. Now
that I’m in, I am freed up to just
go play.”

James also made the national
tournament as an individual last
season where he was +24 over
the four rounds, good enough for
34th.

Athletes prepare for trips to NCAA nationals

Despite heptathalon inexperience, Doornbos is leaving her mark

day, May 20, at 1 p.m, Doom-
bos’ score all but guarantees her
a spot in the heptathlon ﬁeld at
the National Championships.

“My goal at the national meet
is to do the best I can do and
make sure to be ready to com-
pete the day of the meet,” said
Doombos.

“I would love to be in the top
eight and make all-American,
but mainly my goal is to bring it
the day of the meet, because all
the past meets don’t matter when
you get there. It is all about how
you do that day.”

The meet will be held May
24-26 in Titan Stadium at the
University of Wisconsin-Osh
Kosh.

James represents W&L at NCAA golf nationals for the second year in a row

“I feel much better prepared
this year than I did last year,”
said James. “I was a little too
caught up in the excitement of
being at Nationals last year. I'm
very excited this year as well,
but since I know what it is like
to compete in that environment
I should be better able to handle
the mental side of playing on
that stage. I’ve also done well
in other large tournaments since
last year’s NCAA’s, so that adds
some conﬁdence as well.

“The ﬁrst goal is to make the
cut,” said James when asked
about his goals for the touma-
ment. “If I can’t do that, all the
other goals aren’t worth much.
The main plan, however, is to
win. Not quite sure how that goal
is going to pan out just yet.”

Lax surprises Salisbury’

Women take early lead but can ’t hold on against No. 2 team in the nation

By Kevin Corn
STAFF wnman

The women’s lacrosse team
ﬁnished their season this past
week with a 14-4 victory over
the College of Wooster and a 10-
7 loss to No. 2 ranked Salisbury
University.

In the ﬁrst round of the 2007
Division III NCAA’s Women’s
Lacrosse Tournament, the Gener-
als hosted the Wooster Fighting
Scots. Aiding the Generals in their
decisive victory were sophomore
Colleen Evans with four goals and
senior Kelly Evans, who scored
twice and had three assists.

‘ Seniors Karina Schless and
Mallory Lobisser each recorded
two goals apiece, while Britten
Mathews, Kelsi Robinson and ju-
niors Laura Henson and Christine
Bender scored one point each.

Maggie Megear added a pair
of assists while Schless had one.
Junior Sarah Tilbor recorded ﬁve
saves in goal, while sophomore
Ali Hillyard made one additional
stop. ‘

Tennis takes aim at title '

During the match,’ W&L was
first to score, jumping to a 4-0 lead
in the ﬁrst few minutes. Wooster
started to make a comeback with
two goals to cut the Generals’
lead, but the Generals went on to
score four unanswered points by
halftime to make the score 8-2.

In the second half, the Fight-
ing Scots were ﬁrst to score, but
the Generals made six goals be-
fore the ﬁnal buzzer to win 14-4.
After the game, Lobisser said,
“We capitalized on every opportu-
nity we were given in that game.
Wooster played a zone-style de-
fense which we easily exploited.
I think they come from a weaker
conference so we shocked them
with our higher level of play. We
played as a team and put the goal
in the net every chance we got.”

Saturday, the Generals traveled
to Salisbury, Maryland to take _on
the nation’s second ranked team.
Washington and Lee’s seven
points came from Megan Slos—
son who scored twice, and Col-
leen Evans, Kelly Evans, Avery
Lovejoy, Megear and Robinson,

who all scored once. Assists were
made by Lovejoy, Robinso, and
Slosson.

Sarah Tilbor made thirteen
saves in her 56 and a half minutes
ofplay, while Ali Hillyard played
for three and a half minutes. Hill-
yard had to come into the game
because Tilbor was hit with a yel-
low card.

In the ﬁrst ten minutes ofplay,
W&L grabbed a 3-1 lead over
Salisbury.

But the Sea Gulls charged back
as Stephanie Shores ignited a four
goal run with eighteen minutes to
go in the half.

With eleven minutes left in the
half, the Generals were down 5-3,
but they rallied to take a 5-5 tie
into halftime.

During the second half, both
teams scored once, and then Salis-
bury’s Shores and Natalie Degele
scored to give the Sea Gulls a 9-6
lead with almost twenty minutes
left in the game.

W&L’s Slosson scored once
more to bring the score to 9-7.
However, the Generals were un-

able to make it past the Sea Gulls’

defenders for the rest of the game,

leaving them with a 10-7 loss.
Lobisser said afterwards, “We

played amazing against Salis-"Q

bury. There was a point in the
game when I thought, ‘wow, we
are going to beat the number 2
team in the country.’ We were up
by 2 goals at one point and just
couldn’t hold on. The Salisbury
team grossly under-estimated us
and I think we shocked them in
the ﬁrst few minutes. This team, if
we play smart, can beat anyone.”
Lobisser went on to comment

about the season as a whole: “I.

think we had an unbelievable sea-
son. The depth and heart of this
team surpassed that of past teams
and I honestly thought this was
our year.

“No. 1 Franklin and Marshal
has said that we were their tough-
est competition all season and we
would have loved the opportu-
nity to play them again. Overall,
I couldn’t have asked for a better
senior season.”

Women look to cap an amazing season with national team championship, while
Applegate and Wortham are selected to play in individual singles championship

By Mlchael Keenan

After defeating Swarthmore
College and the University of
Mary‘ Washington on their home
court, the Washington and Lee
women’s tennis team travels to
the nearby Battleground Complex
in Fredericksburg, Va., to take on
Middlebury in the-quarterﬁnals of
the national championship.

“Being at Mary Washington,
only two and a half hours away,
we are hoping it will allow some
people to road trip out to watch
and support us during our match-
es,” said junior Leah Weston. “We
believe we have a home court ad-
vantage, and having people come
support us at our matches could
be beneﬁcial in helping us step it
up."

W&L has been selected to
compete in the national touma-
ment every year since 1994.

“Nationals have a completely
different feel from the regular
season,” said sophomore Katie
Tabb. “The ﬁrst couple rounds of
nationals that we play at home are
great, but even that doesn’t com-
pare to the last rounds at another
location.

“Being at Mary Washington, only two and a half

hours away, we are hoping it will allow some

people to...support us during our matches. ’

- Junior Leah Weston

J

“It’s much more exciting to
leave home and feel like you’re
participating in something that’s
a big deal. 1 think the added ex-
citement of the last few rounds is
really what we work for all sea-
son.
In the last 13 NCAA to_uma-
ments, the Generals have ﬁnished
fourth twice, third three times,
and been runners up four times,
including three of the past four
years, but they have yet to win it
all. However, the players down-
played any pressure to ﬁnish ﬁrst.

“Our goals for the team tour-
nament are just to play our best,
win as many of our matches as we
can and most importantly to have
fun,” said Weston. “We are going
to play our best if we relax and
have fun and hopefully this will
allow us to be successful through-
out the rest of the tournament.”

“It’s not really about winning,

92

I don’t think,” said Tabb. “I think
if we can go out there and end
our season saying ‘Regardless of
the results this year, win or lose,
we played the best we could, we
fought until the end, and we had
a lot of ﬁm together.’ That’s what
really makes our season a suc-
cess.”

The Generals are led by se-
niors Emily Applegate and Ginny
Wortham. Both players were se-
lected to compete in the 32 player
individual singles championship,
which will be held following the
team tournament, May 18-20.
Tabb was selected as an alternate
and would compete should a com-
petitor become unable to compete.
On the doubles side, the team of
Applegate and Kristen McClung
was one of 16 pairs selected for
the doubles tournament.

The team includes a range of
upperclassmen and freshmen.

“I think every player on the
team is experienced in their own
way,” said Tabb. “There are some
girls who have played at nation-

als every year since their fresh-_,.-b

men year, and there are others for
whom this is their ﬁrst year, but
they have a lot of junior experi-
ence, which I actually think will
end up serving them better in the
pressure situations. The bottom
line is, our team is very deep, and
one reason is because we all know
what to do when we get out there;
we have a lot of drive.”
Middlebury came into the
tournament boasting an 11-4 re-
cord. The Panthers are led by
Amy Roche, who was the NES-

CAC Player of the Year and has’

been selected to compete in both
the individual singles and doubles
national tournaments. To get to
the quarterﬁnals, the quarterﬁ-
nals, Middlebury defeated Vassar
College and Bowdoin College.

Like the Generals, the Pan-
thers have yet to drop a match
in the tournament. In the NCAA
tournament two years ago, the
Generals faced the Panthers in the
national semiﬁnals and emerged
victorious by a score of 5-3.

Mock Con speaker and 2004 candidate says he may run again for White House

By Wesley 0’Dell
surr wmmz

Students gathered in front of
Lee Chapel on Friday to hear
a one-time—and perhaps fu-
ture——candidate for the Demo-
cratic presidential nomination.
Retired four-star General Wesley
Clark spoke to a large crowd on
the sun-baked front lawn about
politics, the rigors of being a
presidential candidate, and the
current group of Democratic
contenders.

Though Clark steadfastly re-
fuses to commit himself either to
run or not to run in 2008, his sup-
porters apparently failed to get
that memo; they roamed among
the pre—speech crowd distribut-
ing business cards advertising
the General’s fundraising organi-
zation and, innocuously enough,
handing out chocolate “Clark
Bars.”

It had the feel of a political
rally about it—appropriately so
for the 100'“ anniversary of the
most accurate and acclaimed
nominating convention simula-
tion.

Mock Con General Chairman
Richard Friedman and President
Kenneth Ruscio gave brief in-
troductory remarks before Clark
took the podium; Ruscio, a for-
mer Mock Con Co-Chair him-
self, quipped that the ’08 Mock

Con “will force students to be-
come Democrats, a role that——
for some of them at least——will
be a challenge.”

Clark began his speech by
noting his ﬁrst visit to campus
with his son many years ear-
lier; his son, also named Wesley,
spent the night in a frat house—
an experience he enjoyed great-
ly. The General thought it was
“one of the great mistakes of [my
son’s] young life’’ not to come
to W&L, whose namesakes he
said “epitomized the quality of
leadership—leadership in war,
leadership in peace, leadership
of vision and compassion.”

2004 revisited

Clark’s remarks touched on
his own experiences as a presi-
dential candidate, a process he
described as “grueling” and
“demeaning.” He lamented the
effectiveness of negative at-
tack ads, and expressed concern
about excessive partisanship in
the process: “Don’t condemn
disagreement,” he said, “there is
a duty to be a responsible oppo-
sition.”

He mentioned a particular
piece of advice given to him by
former Virginia Governor Mark
Warner: “in politics, what you
can lose is everything. . .so if you
can live without it, don’t do it.”

In both his prepared remarks
and a press conference held af-
terward, Clark named his deci-
sion to skip the Iowa Caucuses
as fatal to his campaign: “It was
a‘ strategy developed to combat
Howard Dean...it didn’t work
for one reason: Howard Dean
didn’t win Iowa.”

He advised Mock Con par-
ticipants to examine the Demo-
cratic ﬁeld for what he called the
key to victory in any campaign:
a combination of name recogni-
tion, brand image, and money.

“I think every day

about running. ”

WESLEY CLARK, klckoff
speaker

During the ‘press conference,
Clark elaborated on the impor-
tance of brand image. Two days
before the Iowa caucuses, a re-
porter asked a telling question:
“John Kerry was a war hero--he
won a silver star and a purple
heart in Vietnam—You were
in the military, weren’t you in
Vietnam, too? How does your
military record compare to John
Kerry’s?”

Said General Clark, himself
a decorated combat veteran of
Vietnam but also a four-star

general, “if you have to explain
that three days before the vote in
Iowa, then you know you didn’t
build the brand image to deﬁne
yourself.”

Politics new and old

Clark also took the audience
on a brief tour of the current po-
litical climate and how it came
about. He praised international
efforts during the Cold War to
deter Soviet aggression and as-
serted that American victory
validated a foreign policy based
on human rights and the consent
of the governed. He particularly
emphasized what he called a
“national strategy” during that
period which directed everything
from nuclear missiles to Olym-
pic teams in an all-encompassing
effort to confront the Soviets.

“However, after the Cold
War,” he said, “we lost our ad-
versary and we lost our. strat-
egy.”

It was this loss of national fo-
cus, he claimed, that left the U.S.
open to turmoil in foreign policy
and ultimately led to missteps in
the years following 9/11.

He talked up his own cre-
dentials on national planning,
recounting his attempt while a
top general to gather support
for what he called a “strategy of
engagement and enlargement”

designed to counter rogue states,
nuclear proliferation, narco-tcr-
rorism, and the possibility of a
resurgent Russia. His plan was
never carried out, however, and

‘he even quipped that “today, a

‘strategy of engagement and en-
largement’ would sound like a
spam message for a men’s phar-
maceutical product.”

He minced no words when it
came to Iraq, which he called the
“overriding issue” of the current
political scene and “the presi-
dent’s war.”

“His plan, his war,” said
Clark, adding that there is “no
end in sight.” An avowed inter-
nationalist who has called for
America to join the International
Criminal Court, Clark particular-
ly criticized what he called “the
devastating impact on the legiti-
macy of U.S. aims and methods
in the world.”

He maintained that the war the
U.S. must ﬁght is one of hearts
and minds, saying that “we can’t
succeed by killing people.”

He also mentioned other
challenges facing the nation, in-
cluding the emergence of China
as an economic power “with the
potential for causing us to ques-
tion who we are as a nation” and
issues “too big for one nation to
solve” such as disease, climate
change, and human rights.

Campaign ‘08

Clark also favored the audi-
ence with a few comments on
the current candidates for the
White House, who he said were
now “competing for money and
endorsements.” He described
Ohio representative Dennis Ku-
cinich as “a legitimate candi-
date,” called Joe Biden “a very
credible analyst,” and remarked
that John Edwards “wants to be
president” and has “independent
means—no normal job.”

He called Barrack Obama a
“phenomenon” and praised Hill-
ary Clinton for having “seen it
all.”

Clark also conceded that the
candidate who claims the Demo-
cratic nomination may not yet
be in the race. “I haven’t said
I’m not running,” he said in re-
sponse to a question about who
he would endorse. When the Phi
pointed out his popularity on the
speaking circuit during the ’O6
midterrns, suggesting it was a
strong incentive for him to run,
Clark mischievously responded
“I’ve thought about it.”

“We’re not gonna get you
to budge, are we?” said the re-
porter.

Clark responded with a laugh,
“I think every day about run-
ning.”

Members of the Young Democrats and College Republicans consider a question during Wednesday night's debate (above). The donkeys chose to wear more casual attire,
while the elephants stuck to more conservative dress. The two sides clashed on whether the United States needed a timetable for withdrawing from Iraq but found common
ground on issues such as immigration and global warming. (Below) Senior David Kronenfeld answers a question for the College Republicans during the debate.

Student debate and political panel discuss 200819 issues

By Dane Davis and
Grace Wang
STAFF wamaas

Four distinguished leaders from the
world of politics addressed the Wash-
ington and Lee community on May 24
as part of the Spring Kickoff of the 2008
Democratic Mock Convention.

Hosted by Wesley Little, a junior
Economics major, Washington and Lee
welcomed Mike Allen, Steve Jarding,
Dr. Larry Sabato, and Chuck Todd to a
Presidential Issues panel discussion held
in Lee Chapel.

The panelists were excited and hon-
ored to contribute to what is considered
one of W&L’s ﬁnest traditions.

Sabato said, “I wish every college in
the nation could have a Moc Convention
like yours. You instill civic virtues in a
new generation of young people.”

Entertaining questions from profes-
sors and students, the four panelists en-
gaged in lively discussion about key is-

T sues concerning our democratic system,

such as the 2008 presidential campaign,
the electoral system, and Virginia’s fu-
ture role in politics.

Mike Allen, a Washington and Lee
‘86 alumnus and chief political corre-
spondent for Politico, a 2008 campaign

' news website, assessed the campaigns of

Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barack
Obama, and Republican Fred Thomp-
son.

Allen said the Obama campaign is
high-energy but lacks the organization
and experience of the Hilary Clinton
campaign.

On Republican Fred Thompson’s
possible run for the presidency, Allen

‘believes that Mr. Thompson will indeed

run and is pursuing a smart strategy by
waiting for political exhaustion to affect

’ the other candidates’ campaigns.

Steve Jarding, a campaign manager,
has had a long-standing history organiz-
ing and winning numerous political cam-
paigns.

In 2001, Jarding propelled Mark War-
ner into the gubernatorial seat of Vir-
ginia. Recently, Jarding ran the seem-
ingly hopeless yet ultimately successful
campaign of current Virginia Senator Jim
Webb.

In addition, Jarding examined mon-

‘ey’s‘ overwhelming inﬂuence on the

current political system and the rise of
citizen democracy through the intemet.
He discussed how S.R. Sidarth, a young
Indian-American student, was able to dra-
matically alter American politics through
his use of Youtube. By capturing Repub-
lican George Allen’s use of the term ‘ma-
caca,’ an offensive term for dark-skinned
people used by French colonists in North
Africa, on camcorder and later posting
this clip on Youtube, Sidarth essentially
ruined the Allen campaign.

Another of the panelists, Dr. Larry Sa-
bato, the Robert Kent Gooch Professor of
Politics at the University of Virginia, has
been called the most quoted college pro-
fessor in the country by the Wall Street
Journal.

Sabato spoke about what he believes
to be the “absolutely insane, abrupt, and
stupid” schedule of the primary system.

When asked about second-tier candi-
dates and their odds in primaries, Sabato
said, “Mike Huckabee lost 110 pounds,
but Jared [from Subway] lost more. Why
shouldn’t Jared be President?”

Sabato also spoke about Virginia’s
changing political climate and empha-
sized how it is moving away from being
an overwhelmingly red state into “one
purplish with a reddish tint.”

When questioned about the impor-
tance of Iowa, Sabato expressed his con-
ﬁdence in the Iowans to pick a principled
and skilled presidential candidate. He
also explained Iowa’s hesitation in elect-
ing another Clinton. If Hilary won the
presidency, two American families would
have held the White House for 25 years.

Sabato said, “Iowans will consider
‘Are we the American republic or are we
a Banana Republic?”

Chuck Todd, NBC News’ political di-
rector and a distant relative of Robert E.
Lee, spoke about Al Gore’s chances for
entering the presidential race.

Todd believes it is unlikely Gore will
enter the race. He explained that Gore
has already supported Obama as acandi-
date and added jokingly that if Gore were
to run, his waist size would go down.

The College Republicans and the
Young Democrats engaged in lively po-
litical discussion of their own, holding
a debate on May 23 in the Stackhouse
Theater.

Representing the College Republicans
were seniors David Kronenfeld and Hank

Gates and sophomore Jack Stanton. The
Young Democrats were led by sopho-
mores Jack Fisher and Oliver Krischik
and freshman Matt May.

Led by Little, the debaters addressed
key hot-button issues such as illegal im-
migration, the wisdom of enforcing a
timetable for exiting Iraq, feasible alter-
native fuel sources, and the beneﬁts of
adopting a universal health care system.

The Young Republicans took a strong
stance against illegal immigration.

Gates, a Politics and History major,
stated that illegal immigration is a bur-
den on the ﬁscal system and a threat to
national security.

He added, “A nation without borders
is not a nation.”

Fisher, a Politics major, agreed with
Gates for the most part.

Regarding the war in Iraq, the Young
Democrats believed that a timetable for
exiting the country is feasible and for
the best interests of the American public.
May stated that the government should
inform the American people what they
hope to accomplish and must do so with-
in an allotted time frame.

The College Republicans disagreed,
saying that setting a timetable is unnec-
essary.

Both sides agreed that the nation must
work diligently to ﬁnd alternative fuel
sources.

Kronenfeld listed several possibilities
for alternative fuel, such as hydrogen, air,
solar power, wind, and biodiesel and ex-
plained the pros and cons of each.

May said improving the environment
should be a collaborative effort between
world nations and that a global initiative
to stop global warming is feasible. He
also added that everyone should go out
and plant a tree to improve the quality of
the environment, a statement that caused
the entire audience to erupt in laughter.

The greatest disagreement of the de-
bate came during discussion about a uni-
versal health care system.

Krischik, a Politics and Psychology
double major, believes that every human
being deserves the right to health care.
He also added that it would be economi-
cally beneﬁcial to employ one large and
overarching health care system.

Gates disagreed, saying that adopting
a universal health care system would be
a ﬁnancial burden. He also questioned

who would beneﬁt from this change be-
sides the individuals receiving health care
who would not have previously.

Sarah Keckler, a freshman from Gard-
ners, Penn., does not think that a polar-
ized debate would have been necessarily
better. She noticed that several of the
questions asked, such as whether to pur-
sue alternative fuel sources, were not set
up for intensive disagreement.

“I don’t think there is anyone out
there—Republican or Democrat—who
would argue that we should not search
out alternative sources.”

However, Keckler was disappointed
by the lack of preparation by the Young
Democrats.

She said, “It was obvious the Republi-
cans were better prepared. Their answers

all contained statistics backing up their
claims while the Democrats were not as
ready.”

Keckler also noted that there was a
clear differentiation between the two
groups in terms of physical appearance.

She said, “The College Republican
representatives were in suits and ties and
had a more professional aura. On the op-
posite side of the coin, the Young Demo-
crat representatives were dressed down.”

Still, Keckler enjoyed the student de-
bate immensely.

She said, “[The debate] inspired me
to start reading more about today’s issues
and learning my own personal viewpoints
on them. It kind of erased that jaded feel-
ing towards politics that has been preva-
lent in our community.”

Ruscio reﬂects on his first year

W&L president sits down to discuss accomplishments and upcoming projects

By Jacob Gelger
MANAGING EDITOR

As Ken Ruscio’s ﬁrst year
as president draws to a close,
Managing Editor Jacob Geiger
sat down with the Class of 1976
alumnus to discuss the key events
of the past year. Though his term
is only nine months old, the new
president has already helped ﬁ-
nalize the new strategic plan and
prepare for future changes.

Ruscio discussed some of the
university’s accomplishments be-
fore going on to detail the goals

this year, whether it’s something
you completed, a project that is
just getting started or a change
you instituted?

Ruscio: I think this was a year
of setting the table for future proj-
ects. Probably the biggest thing
was bringing the Strategic Plan
to conclusion; it was approved
by the Board of Trustees at their
meeting a few weeks ago.

What that does is provide a
clear goal and vision for where
the university wants to be.  It’s
a very ambitious but achievable
plan.

“On the physical plant side we are going to
renovate the Colonnade, replace DuPont Hall,
build a new stadium and rehabilitate the resi-
dential life area.  The stadium will be coming

sooner rather than later ”

KEN RUSCIO, W&L President

 

he and the school will pursue
both next year and further down
the road.

He also discussed what chal-
lenges Washington and Lee will
face in the coming years.

Phi: What’s your most vivid or
exciting memory from the year?

Ruscio: I suppose in a lot of
ways inauguration will stand out
in so many ways, none of them
because of me. It was so pow-
erful for the community  stu-
dents, alumni, faculty and staff to
come together.

Phi: What is the most impor-
tant thing you have accomplished

Phi: What is the biggest proj-
ect for next year?

Ruscio: There are really four
parts to the strategic plan, though
some parts really want come into
effect until years eight, nine or
ten.

The ﬁrst part focuses on stu-
dents, especially making sure we
have the resources to continue to
attract the type of students that we
have historically gotten.

The second part involves fac-
ulty and staff, speciﬁcally being
able to recruit and retain the top
people in each ﬁeld. The third
proposal has to do with academic

initiatives in the law and under-
graduate areas of the school.

Finally, the fourth part is pre-
paring a campus for the 215‘ cen-
tury, with a theme of how do we
educate our future leaders for a
215‘ century world.

There are several projects
coming. The ﬁrst is to shore up
the endowment for ﬁnancial aid,
so that very talented students are
not deterred form attending W&L
because of cost.

The second area is in part
addressed by that generous gift
[from Gerry Lenfest] for faculty
endowment. You know, we didn’t
realize this right away, but in the
last few weeks we have found out
that this is the sixth largest gift
ever given to a national liberal
arts college.

On the physical plant side we
are going to renovate the Colon-
nade, replace DuPont Hall, build
a new stadium and rehabilitate the
residential life area.

Now obviously not all of this
will happen right away, but the
stadium will be coming sooner
rather than later. We’ve also
drawn plans up for renovating
Newcomb Hall. That might start
a year from now if our fundrais-
ing goes well.

Phi: What will be the impact
of the Lenfest donation?

Ruscio: Here’s the way that
will work: Our goal is to be at
the mean of compensation for our
peers, so we’re looking at the top
25 liberal arts institutions. We’re
a little bit below that right now. ...
What you’ll see is not so much a

huge, dramatic, overnight differ-
ence, but 10, 20 or 30 years from
now. Gradually over the next
three to ﬁve years salaries will
move up.

Phi: The Virginia Tech shoot-
ings have dominated the news
and education world this spring.
When will the campus’s security
upgrade be ready?

Rusico: By early fall, if not the
very beginning of the fall semes-
ter. We’re pretty much there right
now.  I think our size certainly
works in our favor in heading off
a crisis and also in responding to
any sort of crisis.

Phi: How good is tolerance
— whether regarding race, gender
or anything else — at W&L?

Ruscio: I think one of the at-
tributes of W&L is we have very
high standards in that area. We
ought to be the kind of university
others look to in regards to show-
ing respect for others.

This is really in regards to our
values as an institution. In the
next week or two I’ll send out an
e-mail reminding people of the
high standards we have in that
area.

Phi: Is W&L involved with
the plans to bring the Museum of
the Confederacy to Lexington?
Does the university have an offi-
cial position?

Ruscio: I and the university
have not been contacted in any
formal way by a representative
from the museum. What I’ve said
to anyone who has asked is that
I cannot imagine any formal re-
lationship between the university

and the museum.

Our missions are very differ-
ent. The museum is in Richmond
right now next to two universities
in Virginia Commonwealth and
the University of Richmond, and
I don’t think there is a close rela-
tionship with either school.

We are not included in the pro-
posal to the museum [that Lex-
ington submitted]. I did ask the
city and tourism board that we not
be included in the proposal.

to make the ﬁnances work.

Phi: What is W&L’s biggest
challenge for the future?

Ruscio: I think our core
strength is in our people — faculty,
staff and students. We are in an
increasingly competitive environ-
ment for those people. We are in
good shape now  we operate
from a position of great strength,
I think, but I want to make sure
we maintain that strength. ... that
is the challenge.

Republicans race to rule

The top 12 Republican candidatesfor the presidency

By Wes Little
COLUMNIST

The past two months have
been busy ones in the race for the
Republican Presidential Nomina-
tion.

In April, the results of the ﬁrst
quarter of campaign fundrais-
ing results were reported, an an-
nouncement that gave renewed
strength to Mitt Romney and
Rudy Guliani while harming the
McCain campaign.

Also shaking up this race
signiﬁcantly is the indication
that conservative favorites Fred
Thompson and Newt Gingrich
will enter the race. The probable
inclusion of these two candidates
adds extra competition for the
supporters, endorsements and
campaign cash needed to win the
nomination.

In this segment The Campaign
Candor, I will give you an idea of
the current status and standings of
the Republican Presidential race.

1. Mayor Rudy Giuliani
“America’s Mayor” has tight-
ened his grip on the leadership of
this race with high national poll
numbers around 27 percent, a suc-
cessful $15 million fundraising
haul and two successful debates.
He must keep the Republican
electorate’s focus on his national
security gravitas and away from
his unpopular views on social is-

Luhmann.

sues in order to continue his mo-
mentum.

2. Sen. Fred Thompson

Without even announcing that
he will run for president, this for-
mer Tennessee senator and current
Law & Order actor has enthralled
the conservative base of the party
and given them the hope of hav-
ing a viable social conservative in
the race. Look for Thompson to
start quietly locking up important
supporters and staff and make an
announcement in the ﬁrst part of
June.

3. Sen. John McCain

Once the race’s clear leader,
Senator McCain’s campaign suf-
fered in April following his disap-
pointing fundraising results of $ 1 2
million and falling polling num-
bers. However, McCain’s strong
debate presence, experienced
campaign team and strength in
states like Iowa and New Hamp-
shire make him impossible to
count out in this race.

4. Gov. Mitt Romney

This former governor of Mas-
sachusetts used his strong network
of supporters to raise $22 million
in the ﬁrst quarter of this year,
more than any of his competitors.
Nonetheless, he will have to deal
with questions about his Mormon-
ism and ideological ﬂip-ﬂopping
in order to raise his poll numbers

Luhmann works out of a radi-
cal school of system theory, and
his main focus is the improbabil-
ity of the existence of organiza-
tions.

He is puzzled by the fact that
organizations remain cohesive,
but is at the same time confronted
by the sheer number of existing A
and long standing— organizations.

In Luhmann’s theory, organi-

above his current position in the
10 percent range.

5. Gov. Mike Huckabee

This fonner Arkansas gover-
nor has performed very well in
the debates but still has miniscule
polling numbers and little money
from fundraising with which to
raise them.

6. Rep. Newt Gingrich

No one excites the Conserva-
tive base like this former House
Speaker, but it is unclear if Gin-
grich’s plan to enter the race near
September could garner enough

. support to convince Republican

voters to nominate one of the most
divisive politicians around. His
strategy may also be hampered
the entrance of fellow conserva-
tive favorite Fred Thompson.

7, Rep. Tom Tancredo

This Colorado congressman’s
campaign could rise with the
prominence of his signature is-
sue, immigration, in the minds of
Republican voters. His $1 million
ﬁrst quarter fundraising was sur-
prisingly strong but his poll num-
bers are still hovering not far from
zero percent.

8. Sam Brownback

He led the “second tier” in
fundraising with $1.25 million,
but his sub-par performance in
the debates and tiny polling re-

zations divide the world in a bi-
nary code: The organization itself
and the surroundings.

The organization itself is de-
scribed as a ‘black box,’ as one
will never be able to grasp the
entirety of its ideology. Pushing
this further, Luhmann also claims
that humans too are ‘black boxes’
whose internal motivations don’t
mean anything.

Realizing that organizations
are based on communication,
Luhmann breaks up the act of
communicating into three parts:
information, discourse and con-
nection. Infonnation represents
the facts that are presented, dis-
course is the way it is communi-
cated and connection is how fur-
ther communication reacts to the
message.

The latter part is crucial to un-
derstanding Luhmann, as a mes-
sage isn’t communication ‘until
further messages are based on it.

sults raise serious doubts about
his potential of breaking into the
group of top candidates.

9. Rep. Duncan Hunter

A San Diego congressman
with experience and expertise in
military matters, Hunter lacks
signiﬁcant campaign cash and
has yet to ﬁnd a constituency in
this crowded and likewise accom-
plished ﬁeld.

10. Gov. Tommy Thompson

The former Governor of Wis-
consin and_the leader of his state’s
acclaimed reform of welfare,
Thompson has one of the best
governing records in the race but
seemed genuinely lost in the past
two debates.

11. Rep. Ron Paul

This former Libertarian can-
didate for president and current
Texas congressman has an en-
ergetic group of supporters, but
they will probably not be enough
to garner this eccentric candidate
enough support to be a serious
force in this race. A current mo-
tion to limit the size of the debates
would likely end Paul’s chances.

12. Gov. Jim Gilmore

No one is quite sure why this
former Governor of Virginia is
running for president, as evi-
denced by his paltry $175,000
ﬁrst quarter fundraising.

The communication within the
organization is therefore the self-
referential and reproducing force
that provides the organization its
internal logic and understanding.
No decision or articulated aim is
truly tangible until further com-
munication validates it as being
so.

For example WWII isn’t nec-
essarily more important than me
buying a piece of gum, but the ac-
ademic (and loose) organization
of historians continuously per-
petuate the signiﬁcance of WWII
by relating to previous notions of
its importance.

So how does an organization
make decisions? Each decision
made requires a choice between
alternatives, or else it wouldn’t
be a choice. Since one alterna-
tive isn’t essentially better than
the other, one would suspect or-
ganizations to be paralyzed when
faced with this paradox of unity

People ask all the time if we compete against the Trident.
There’s a perception on campus that the two staffs are always
trying to get the better of each other, always trying to out do

To some extent, that might be true. The Phi’s writers and
editors always want to beat the Trident to a scoop, and we

But beyond that, both papers have the same mission and the
same goals: we want to serve the community, report the news
and provide forums for community discussion.

We have different styles, different layouts and different
staffs. We focus our energy on different issues.

But it’s all the same mission.

That’s why the two papers joined together in April to pro-
duce a pair of special editions that covered the campus’s ﬁrst
Open Hearing in more than a decade.

Both student newspapers have made some great strides this
year, and we’ve also been fortunate enough to see a student-
run news show come to campus as well.

There’s no denying that the last three years have been tu-
multuous ones for the Phi. The paper has been completely re-
designed, gone through a huge amount of staff turnover, and
weathered its share of controversy.

Whether it was Behind Bars, heated debates on the edito-
rial pages about admissions standards or controversy between
students and angry neighbors, the Phi has tried to keep up with

In the coming year there will certainly be more important

The solution, Luhmann ar-
gues, is that organizations never
make that realization and instead
communication just arbitrarily
chooses one option as its infor-
mation. Depending on whether or
not this communication is accept-
ed or challenged by future com-
munication, this may evolve into
a decision or be forgotten. As a
result, organizations only operate
on the level of ﬁrst order observa-
tion, where the alternatives aren’t
presented in the communication.

Differentiating between rel-
evant and irrelevant communica-
tion is done through a binary cod-
ing, determining whether or not
the communication involves the
organization.

Practically, Luhmann’s theory
provides the tools for observing
behavior within groups.

For example the statement
“Let’s have a party tonight” isn’t
relevant until further communica-
tion validates it as a decision. And
likewise saying “I’d like a burger
right now” in class is considered
outside the system of academic
learning, whereas it might be in-
cluded in the system of friendship
to which you are saying it.

The most criticized part of
Luhmann’s system theory is his
complete disdain for human mo-
tivation and emotion. We are per-
ceived as mere cogs in a greater
system, albeit being able to par-
ticipate in several systems.

But this radicalism is essential
for Luhmann in order to move
beyond a system theory that deals
with ideology and instead deals
with the direct constitution of the
system.

Surviving Karnataka

Spring Term in India a crazy but charming experience

By Jess Steinmetz
COLU M N I sr

While most W&L students are
currently in the midst of a tradi-
tional Spring Term of studying
and partying in Lexington, I along
with 23 of my peers am in a world
so very different than the one we
are familiar with.

Along with three professors,
we are braving the streets of My-
sore, a city located in Kamataka,
India.

As a group, W&L students re-
ally stand out in Mysore. Most of
us are taller than the average In-
dian, dress in western clothes, do
not speak Hindi, have American
accents and many members of the
group are very pale and/or blond.

All this makes us prime targets
for attention, especially by ven-
dors.

Shopping in India is complete-
ly different than any type of shop-
ping back home. Prices are never
set, even when signs claim other-
wise. Some stores even go really
far out and hang signs in broken

English such as, “Customer is
King. King never Bargain.”

While salespeople in America
are often quite persistent, I have
never been followed around town
by one. In India, this happens
almost every single time we go
out.

Since we are “tourists,” we
are of course targeted by vendors.
They always follow my friends
and I to try to sell us something
that we genuinely have no need
for, would never dream of buy-
ing, did not even look at in the
ﬁrst place or is often just plain
confusing.

Why would I buy Q-tips, for
example, at the Palace of My-
sore?

We get around town in rig-
shaws, which is a phenomenon
that truly must be experienced
ﬁrsthand. But since most of you
will probably never set a foot in
India, I will do my best to ex-
plain.

A rigshaw is a mix between a
motorized car and a bike. They
have no doors and seatbelts and

under law can only hold up to
three passengers. We, however,
have had as many as seven of us
in one.

In India, or at least in Kama-
taka, there are yellow lines down
the middle similar to the ones we
have in the States. Back home,
drivers often break the holy yel-
low line to pass a slow car.

Crazy drivers, like my grand-
pa (who felt that these lines are
merely suggestions and drove on
the middle or even the wrong side
of the road), do exist. Nearly ev-
ery driver in Kamataka, however,
must truly believe that these lines
are suggestions. _

I am still not even sure why
they have these lines. All of the
rigshaws I have driven in are just
as much on the wrong side of the
road as on the right one.

Surprisingly, I have not seen a
single accident. This is probably
due to the fact that the average
rigshaw driver uses his horn ap-
proximately every ﬁve seconds.

While this of course gets quite
old on a 10 minute drive into

the city, it just adds to the crazy
charm of India.

Prices are extremely reason-
able in India, even for a broke
college student like me. I love go-
ing out to eat at a hotel and hav-
ing it cost less than three dollars.
Living in an environment where
40 rupees equals one American
dollar skews traditional concepts
of bargaining.

This is where the rigshaw and
shopping experiences meet its
most ridiculous point: bargaining
for a rigshaw. Although rigshaws
have meters, both the passengers
and the driver often try to avoid
them, hoping to beneﬁt through
bargaining.

Whenever we go out in
groups, one person always ends
up bargaining with the driver
down to the last rupee. Last night
for example, my friend bargained
for ﬁve minutes over ﬁve rupees,
which is the equivalent of 12
cents.

And that is when you just have
to laugh and love the craziness of
India.

Anyone who’s watched shows at
W&L over the last few years should no
longer be surprised when Lauren Kampf
steals the show.

But this weekend in the Lenfest Cen-
ter, Kampf did just that, wowing audi-
ences with biting, bitter and sarcastic
rendition of Lilli Vanessi and Kate in
“Kiss Me, Kate.”

Her standout performance capped a
busy and successful career on the W&L
stages.

“It’s deﬁnitely bittersweet,” Kampf
said after opening night. “This cast is
awesome and so much fun to work with,
but it’s bittersweet since this is my last
show.”

“Kiss Me, Kate” gives the audience
a backstage look at a dysfunctional the-
ater company trying to perform Shake-
speare’s “Taming of the Shrew” on a hot
summer night in Baltimore.

“Working with [Lauren]
is a dream. She takes

had meant to send to another actress.
The result is less than cheery.

Kampf and Matt Amling, the sopho-
more who played Graham, hold a snarl-
ing and nasty ﬁght that rages both on
stage and off. Kate’s solo mid-way
through Act One really says it all: “I
Hate Men.”

Amling played Graham as the straight
man, letting Kampf provide most of the
comedy at his expense. On the musical
numbers, however, he took a backseat
to nobody and his powerful, impressive
voice ﬁlled the packed theater.

And to make sure things didn’t get
too slow, a pair of gangsters were hang-
ing around throughout the show, trying

to collect $10,000 from Graham. Real-
izing that the gangsters might give him
some leverage, Graham tells them that
he won’t have their money unless the
show is a success.

When Vanessi won’t return to the
stage because Graham had given her
a severe on-stage spanking, the gang-
sters switch their double-breasted suits
out for Shakespearean tights. They do,
however, bring their pistols along.

As the play rolled along, Cody Beau-
champ and Frank Lee III—whether wear-
ing their suits or the tights—always had
the audience laughing. Their perfor-
mance really peaked, however, with the
show-stopping number, “Brush up Your
Shakespeare.” The audience could not
get enough of the singing and dancing
gangsters as they traded their pistols out
for hats and canes.

“For the ﬁrst few weeks a lot of what
we were doing was working with the
[dance choreographer],” Beauchamp
said. “Halfway through we started
working with the cast  it was sort of
a mirror to the show, where these two
guys just show up out of nowhere.”

Director Rob Mish said the challenge
for him was always trying to look at the
big picture.

“Not only do you have cast, crew,
music, design and lighting,” Mish said,
but “the director has to have the whole
picture and imagine what he wants on
stage and then explain it to the group.”

Mish appeared alongside Kampf last
year in the “Pirates of Penzance,” but
this was his ﬁrst time directing her.

“Working with [Lauren] is a dream,”
he said. “She takes direction really well
and brings so much to a character.”

Kampf hopes to pursue an acting
career after graduation. She said her
favorite role was Ruth in “Pirates,” but
she also would like to play Maureen
from “Rent” or any of the characters in
“Les Miserables.”

Beauchamp said his ﬁrst time on the
W&L stage made him feel like he was
joining a theater family. He said veter-
ans like Kampf and Michael Wagoner,
a senior who played the role of General
Harrison Howell, were very welcoming
to the new actors.

‘‘It is really fun,” Beauchamp said,
“to work with people who are about as
professional as you can get without get-
ting a paycheck.”

Women’s tennis wins NCAA team title

Senior Emily Applegate places second in individual singles tournament

By Mlchael Keenan
sPoRrs EDITOR

The past three years the Wash-
ington and Lee women’s tennis
team has seen incredible sea-
sons come to an end just short of
bringing home a national cham-
pionship. This year, they would
not be denied. With a 5-2 victory
over Amherst College, the team
claimed the ﬁrst women’s nation-
al championship in school history
and just the second overall.

On Tuesday, May 15th, the
Generals played their quarterﬁ-
nal match against the Panthers of
Middlebury College.

“Everyone knew what a battle
it was going to be after doubles,
and Middlebury fought hard,”
said junior Kelly Will.

“That ﬁrst match against
Middlebury was extremely tight.
Watching the match at 3-3, I
knew that we needed two more
courts to win,” said senior Ginny
Wortham.

“Off the court watching the
team was deﬁnitely nervous that
it could be our last match of the
season, but on the court I think
the last three players were very
conﬁdent and knew they were go-
ing to stay out there until we got
the last two points,” said junior
Leah Weston.

Tabb’s victory in No. 3 singles
over Emery, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4, pro-
vided the point and the Generals
were through to the semiﬁnals.

“I think that match was the
toughest of the tournament. The
close victory over Middlebury
deﬁnitely motivated us for the next
two matches,” said Wortham.

The team made a point of en-
joying the experience and staying
relaxed as well.

“We would drive up to the
courts with our music blasting
and we’d be singing along and
dancing in the van,” said Will.
“We were about to play an incred-
ibly important match and here we
are being silly to ‘Glamorous’ or
‘Give It To Me.”’

In the semiﬁnals the next day,
the Generals faced the Ephs of
Williams, who had handed the
Generals their only loss of the
season.

“Losing to Williams in the
regular season was probably one
of best things that could have mo-
tivated us for that match,” said
Wortham. “When we played Wil-
liams during the regular season, I
think we came out a little ﬁat in
the doubles and never regained
our momentum into singles,” said
Wortham. “Not Wednesday.”

After sweeping the doubles
matches, sophomore Katie Tabb
and Will earned victories to end
the match, 5-0, meaning W&L
would be in the ﬁnals for the third
year in a row. This year the Gen-
erals would meet Amherst, who
defeated Sewanee 5-0 to secure

their berth in the ﬁnals.
“The atmosphere at Mary
Washington surrounding the

match was unbelievable,” said
Wortham. “There were so many
people - family and friends -
watching and cheering.”

“The team tried to look at the
championship match as just being
another match in order for us to
stay relaxed,” said Weston. “Re-
gardless, there is no denying that
playing in the ﬁnals of nationals
caused a thrilling atmosphere 0
anxiety and excitement.” «

The Generals scored the ﬁrst
point of the match when Weston
and freshman Lauren Caire de-

feated Arnherst’s duo of Jennifer
Murphy and Laura Stein at No.
3 doubles. Amherst evened the
score when Alicia Menezes and
Brittany Berckes beat Emily Ap-
plegate and Kristen McClung at
No. 1 doubles, 8-3. The Generals
took the ﬁnal point of the doubles
portion when Tabb and Wortham
defeated Katie Hudson and Jill
Wexler at no. 2 doubles, -8-5.

In singles, Will quickly de-
feated Murphy 6-0, 6-2, to give
the Generals a 3-1 lead. Soon
after, senior Emily Applegate de-
feated Menezes 6-2, 6-1, to bring
the Generals within one match of
winning the title. Though Berckes
defeated Wortham to cut the Gen-
erals lead to 4-2, soon Tabb had
match point in her No. 3 singles
match against Monica Snyder.

“I just remember realizing
that Katie Tabb had match point,
watching her win the point, and
then running on to her court,”
said Wortham. “I was in shock. I
couldn’t believe that we had won.
The victory was even more spe-
cial because we were able to share
it with our entire team, friends,
and especially our family mem-
bers who have been supporting us
since we were junior players.”

“The moment we won the
national championship was ob-
viously the best moment of that
week, and being with the team
the rest of the day and celebrat-
ing together was the best memory
of the week, and one of the best
moments of my entire life,” said
Weston.

“While I would have loved to
win the last two ﬁnals I played,
winning this year was so much
more special,” said Wortham.
“Winning a national champion-

ship has been my goal since I
started playing on the women’s
tennis team my freshman year.
Not only was it the perfect ending
to my college career, I am so glad
I could share this victory with this
special group of people. “

Applegate, Wortham, and
Tabb were chosen to play in the
individual singles tournament and
the duo of Applegate and Mc-
Clung were chosen to play in the
doubles tournament.

“The individual part of the
tournament is like a completely
new tournament,” said Wortham.

Only Applegate survived the
ﬁrst round. Tabb was defeated by
Pomona-Pitzer’s Siobhan Fini-
cane 6-2, 0-6, 1-6, Wortham fell
to Middlebury’s Amy Roche, 6-4,
3-6, 2-6, and Applegate and Mc-
Clung lost to Jordan Hook and
Karly Olson of Wheaton College
7-5, 3-6, 3-6.

ApplegatedefeatedWellesley’s
Jenna Mezin in the ﬁrst round and
rallied against The College of
New Jersey’s Jackie Shtemberg
to win 4-6,16-4, 6-4, in the second
round. The next day, Applegate
defeated Megan Tiegs of St. Bene-
dict and Wheaton’s Jordan Hook
in straight sets to advance to the
ﬁnals for the second straight year
to face top-seeded Liz Bondi of
DePauw. After losing the ﬁrst set
6-2, Applegate came back to take
tie the match with a 6-4 victory in
the second set. However, Bondi
won the third set in a tie break to
win the individual title. This was
just the sixth loss in Applegate’s
career. At W&L, Applegate won
65 matches.

The Generals will return four
of the players who competed at
nationals next year as they look to
defend their title.

Doombos shines in hep at NCAAS

By Kevin Corn
snxrr warren

Sophomore Stacy Doombos

spent last Thursday and Friday
busy in Oshkosh, Wisc., at the
2007 Track and Field Division III
NCAA Championships, compet-
ing in the Women’s Heptathlon.
Doombos ﬁnished 14"‘ in her ﬁrst
trip to Nationals.

“It was an awesome opportuni-
ty to compete here at the NCAAS
this year. I had a lot of fun. It was
more competitive obviously than
the hep[tathlon]s that I have been
competing in throughout this
year,” said Doombos alter the
meet. “Also, one main difference
was that I was not use to compet-
ing with that many competitors.
There were 18 girls competing
this year and the most I have ever

done a hep with is 8.”

Doombos competed well after
battling severe weather condi-
tions on Day 1, including wind
gusts of up to 51 miles an hour.
Doombos ran her 100m hurdles
with a 29 mile per hour wind at
her back. This helped her to run a
career best time of 15.77 seconds,
good for 743 points.

“What is really good about
this meet is that they can turn
the events around so that the ath-
letes are running with the wind to
help them,” Doombos said of her
hurdle race. “With the 100 meter
hurdles I think it really helped all
the athletes who competed to run
their best times this season.”

After the hurdles, Doombos
cleared 5’ 0.25” in the high jump,
earning her another 655 points.
Then, in the shot put, Doombos

threw just under thirty feet to earn
471 points.

The ﬁnal event on Thursday
was the 200m dash.

“The winds had actually
slowed because it started to rain
really hard,” said Doombos. i“It
would have been nice to have had
a tail wind for the 200.”

Doombos still ﬁnished strong
with a time of 25.61, good for
ﬁﬂth place, 832 points, and reset-
ting her own school record in the
event.

Friday’s ﬁrst event was the
long jump, where Doombos
placed ﬁlth by jumping 16’ 9.25”,
earning another 589 points. Next,
Doombos threw the javelin a dis-
tance of 59’ 6.25”, adding an ad-
ditional 254 points to her total.

Finally, Doombos prepared
for her 800m run, the last event in

Most college golfers would
be satisﬁed with simply making
an appearance at the four-day
National Championships at the
end of a season. Only 120 golfers
were invited to take part in the Di-

vision III event, hosted by Ander-
son University from May 15-18.
Junior Nathaniel James was the
only one from Washington and
Lee. But that honor, enough for
most golfers, didn’t satisfy James.
Despite his eventual ﬁnish, tied
for 19th, he expressed unhappi-
ness with his performance.

“I was out of sync pretty much
the whole time and was not able
to ﬁnish well on the last day,” he
said. With a top ten ﬁnish in sight,
James shot a 7-over 79 on Friday’s
fourth round and ﬁnished with a
307 for the four-day tournament,
19 strokes over par and only four
strokes out of tenth position.

Much of James’ performance
can be explained by the conditions
he faced at The Hawthoms Coun-
try Club in Fisher, Indiana. The
ﬁeld struggled with the course,
suﬁering what James called “three
days of diﬂicult conditions.” Only
champion Clinton Dammann was
under par for the tournament. '

A St. John’s won the team title,
shooting 300-300-301-303 to ﬁn-
ish at +52. Each team that won its
conference took ﬁve golfers to the
event. W&L failed to qualify as a
team because they ﬁnished second
in the ODAC tournament from
April 21st to 23rd. The victors of
that tournament, Guilford College,
ﬁnished seventh at the national
tournament. That left James as the
sole W&L golfer in the ﬁeld, which
he called “the greatest disappoint-
ment of the year... [The team was]
so close to going this year that it
was really tough to get over.” The
promising Generals squad ﬁnished
17 strokes behind Guilford in that

the heptathlon.

“I really look forward to all the
events in the hep so I just went
into [the 800] the same way I do
in all my events, I do the best I
can and try to focus on just one
event at a time,” said Doombos.

Doombos went on in the 800
to ﬁnish fourth in the event with
a time of 2:22.89, earning 785
points, bringing her ﬁnal total to
4329 points. With this total, Door-
nbos captured 14"‘ in the Nation.

“Overall the meet went well,”
said Doombos. “I had a lot of fun
and learned a lot about competing
in the hep. I am already looking
forward to next year and hope-
fully next year I will be up on the
podium. Since I was one of the
youngest girls there for the hep, I
think it just takes time to learn all
those events.”

nationals

event, though many, including
James, thought they had the talent
to win and continue on to Nation-
als.

While admittedly downtrod-
den about this May’s results,
James is already looking forward
to next season, where he hopes
to ﬁnish in the top ﬁve golfers
nationally. That would require
an improvement greater than the
one made by James over the last
twelve months. In his sophomore
year, James ﬁnished at 24-over
at the National Championships.
Placing among Division III’s most
elite is an ambitious goal simply
by virtue of the players retum-
ing for next season. Dammann is
a junior, and 12 of the 18 golfers
who ﬁnished ahead of James will
compete next year.

However, James said he is fo-
cusing on the team’s expectations
for the year ahead. “This team is
deﬁnitely one that can win [the
conference] next season. I will
be extremely disappointed if we
don’t. We have a lot of great play-
ers on our team that have been
steadily improving and maturing
over the last couple of years. I
anticipate having an extremely
competitive team next year ca-
pable of excelling at all levels of
competition.”
