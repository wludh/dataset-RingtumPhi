THE FRESHMAN ISSUE

By SARAH GILBERT
Phi Executive Editor

Washington and Lee’s student
governing body, called the Ex-
ecutive Committee, is basically
responsible for the care of two
important parts of the student
body: our honor and our money.

The first part of this care you
will see very soon, as Kevin
Webb, EC president, and his band
of EC representatives help_to ori-
ent you to the Washington and

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Lee honor system.

The honor system orientation
is one of the- most important parts
of your introduction to W&L, as
we consider the honor system to
be integral to our fine tradition of
scholarship and conduct. With-
out it, we would not be half the
university we are today, and
Webb is entrusted with both edu-
cating you and implementing the
honor system in its most practi-
cal form, conducting investiga-
tions and hearings.

The EC is also concerned with

collectingandapportioningthe
money raised from your stu-
dent activities fees, and it is he
who helps to decide where the
money goes.

The EC is made up of a
representative from each law
and undergraduate class at
W&L. The elections for
upperclass officers are held in
the spring, and the freshmen
and first-year law students
elect their representatives in
the fall.

The EC typically operates

Freshmen and upperclassmen are undertaking the monumental task of moving their lives from
back home to down home Lexington.

By SARAH GILBERT
Phi Executive Editor

Problems in recent years with
freshman men doing poorly in
classes during rush has led the
lnterfraternity Council to adopt a
modified rush program.

Only one band party will be
allowed at each fraternity during
rush, as opposed to a more open
allowance last year. These band
parties must be completely dry,
with a rule that even brothers
who are of age must not drink in
the house during the party.

Associate Dean of Students

Leroy “Buddy”Atkins, who acts
as the Dean of Greek Affairs,
said that national laws were the
driving force behind the new,
stricter “dry” rules this year.
“The main point [of the new
program] is to get rid of alcohol,”
Atkins said. “We also want to

minimize the conflict [of rush];

freshmen tear their bids at last year's tear night. New restrictions on rush

, this year aim to make scenes like this less common.

‘ Abbreviated rush schedule
‘ cuts back on bands, drinking

with academics; we are trying to
do more on the weekends, so we
don't interfere with studying or
thinking about studying.’

Open houses, which were tra-
ditionally held nearthe end ofthe
rush period, will be held at the
beginning of rush this year.

Problems with two national
fraternities last year resulted in
campus suspensions, so the fra-
ternity pool is slightly smaller
than usual. Delta Tau Delta's

‘ er was suspended indefi-

1.3 itely by their national organiza-

tion last spring, and Phi Gamma
Delta was suspended for 18
months by the IFC last winter.

With 90 percent of Washing-
ton and Lee men pledging a fra-
ternity, the campus depends on a
smoothly-run rush to help the
school make a transition to a new
freshman class.

And with fourteen fraterni- -

ties to choose from, it is impor-
tant that each freshman has an
equal exposure to all the organi-
zations so he can make an in-
formed choice.

“We have implemented the
new program in an effort to see
that freshman and upperclassmeni
get off to a better start in the fall
term,” said Atkins.

After rush, the IFC and the
Student Affairs Committee will
review the issue ofdelayed rush,
which has been discussed and
proposed as an option for W&L
for several years, but never imple-
mented.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

with a very large budget, around
$240,000, and student organi-
zations make their proposals for
funding in the yearly budget
hearings held in September.

Last year, the Executive
Committee revised the White
Book, the bible of Washington
and Lee’s honor code.

As well as orienting the
freshmen to the honor code, the
EC must also take responsibil-
ity for breaking in the new fac-
ulty members. Each new fac-
ulty member will receive a let-

ter about the honor system dur-
ing the summer prior to his or
her employment, and will re-
ceive a visit from an EC mem-
ber upon arriving at the W&L
campus.

Organizations funded by the
EC include the student newspa-
pers, the yearbook (called the
Calyx), club sports such as la-
crosse, rugby and men’s volley-
ball, student concerts such as
next weekend’s concert at the
Pavilion. The Hoodoo Gurus
will be playing at a free concert

ognized individuals, and law
school organizations like the Stu-
dent Bar Association, which
plans social activities and lec-

Freshman class of ‘98
impressive as ever

By PHIL CARROTI‘

Phi Managing Editor

The admissions office didn’t quite hit the
male/female ratio of 60/40; the class of ‘98 is 58/

Every year at the beginning of school the
spotlight is on the incoming freshman class and
how they will size up against previous classes.

According to the bare facts, this year’s fresh-
man class looks to be one of the strongest

high school.

OPINION

 

To the Freshmen

As ifyou had not heard it enough, we at TheRing-
tum Phi would like to welcome you to our campus.

You were told at high school graduation that you
were at a turning point in your life. The end and the
beginning. And several other trite phrases (they
probably threw “Carpe Diem” in there too, but they
meant well).

Well, I hate to be repetitive, but this is a turning
point. The decisions which you make today and in
the next four years will have an extremely impor-
tant impact on your life. Perhaps more important
than any other. g

But you, we believe, are ready to make these
decisions and you have hordes of people here on
campus who are more than eager to guide you
through the tough spots.

From professors to upperclassmen, we’re all
willing to give out free advice to whomever asks for
it. If you want to know who the best professors are,
when to skip dinner at the D—hall, or how to find
Howe Hall, just ask.

Your first semester will be frustrating (probably
only the first six weeks, especially for the men
going through rush), but you’ll get the hang of it in
no time.

As you drove through Lexington this morning, it
may have seemed like a toy town, with its tourist
attractions and the picturesque but otherwise useless
shops. The diminutive town, however, has an almost
confusing array of choices whether you just want
a good sandwich or a good
haircut.

Very small or very large size people hit the jackpot
more often than the mid-ranged sizes.

Each freshman breathes fresh air into this 246

 

year old university. Each one of you has something
to offer W&L and in return it will give you four
years of memories and experiences you will never
forget, on top of an education that many will envy.

All you have to do to get the most out of W&L is
be yourself. Be the student that stood apart from the
others and was considered special enough to attend
W&L. Get involved in whatever interests you.And
have fun. These really will be the best four years of
your lives.

And tell your parents not to worry, Lexington is
one of the safest places to go to school in the
country. The administration does a good job of
keeping it that way, so tell them not to worry if you
forget to call them once in a while.

looking for a great place to take an out-of-town

tired of mass-produced food, ll Palazzo is the best bet.
And for those with tight budgets, try their delicious

The Best Coffee

You can order coffee with your meal anywhere,
but you can bet that the best place to buy coffee is a
shop wholly devoted to the magical bean. Lexington
Coffee Roasting Company pours a mean cup of
cappuccino, and their fresh-roasted coffee is the best
in town. At Christmas time, stock up on their special

“Santa’s Cinnamon Spice.”

J. Crew dress you wanted so desperately six months
ago but could not bear to pay $150 for. Once in a‘

It’s the time of the Welcoming Season

DREAM LAND
Richard Weaver

Let me begin my remarks today by
welcoming you, the class of 1998, to
“The Welcoming Season” here in Lex-
ington. In the coming days prepare to
be heartily welcomed by various deans,
professors, upper-class students, fel-
low freshmen, Jim from East Lex, W&L
Security and TheirTow—Truck Friends,
The Rockbridge County Sheriff’s De-
partment, the Cadaver Society, and
Alvin-Dennis (“The Belt People”).

I know that when I was a freshman
my, reaction was, “Who are these
people?” Then my reaction was,
“What’s for dinner?” and then “Can I
go to sleep now?“ The whole adjust-
ment process to strange little Lexing-
ton (the “Twin Peaks” of Virginia) will
take a while, but that doesn’t mean you
can't step back a minute from your
busy orientation schedule and just laugh
at the place you will soon call home.

On moving-in day two years ago
my father and I pulled up in our full-
size 4x4 Chevrolet truck, carrying all
of my earthly possessions, as well as
two ofmy friends’ things all stacked up
higher than the cab and wrapped in an
enormous blue tarp. We were the Lex-
ington Hillbillies. The various frater-
nity members who were stationed out-

_ side the dorms to help the freshmen

move in walked away from our truck,
from what I assume was fear. Does this
ring a bell with any of you?

I guess that by now you have al-
ready come, seen, and conquered Wal-
Mart, and Mom has purchased all kinds
of nice shelves and bookcases and

Tupperware and sewing kits which I
assure you will never be used for any-
thing other than building an impen-
etrable Berlin Wall between you and
your roommate. l’ll simply refer you to
a recent movie, Single White Female:
“Living with a roommate can be mur-
der.”

Now before I get some angry letters
on cute puppy stationary from people
who really liked their roommates (there
must be, what, eight or nine of those),
l’ll make itclear
nowthat just be-
cause you will
be living with
someone in a

kind of punitive cell during a war-time
rationing of space. I could sit on my
bed and without moving my body reach
any spot in my room. This made it
incredible easy to wake up at 2 p.m.,
dial the phone, pick up my wallet, and
unlock the door to allow Domino’s
Pizza (“Your Pizza Delivered in 30
Minutes Or Less By Our FleetofRolIs-
Royces”) to bring me food.

You say, “Richard, I will never buy
extra food, especially since I will be

lands on your roommate’s head while
he’s sleeping and “accidentally” seals
his mouth shut so you will no longer
hear that bizarre boiling sound that he
makes after drinking your 2-liter bottle
of Dr. Pepper.

I, of course, irresponsibly make
these generalizations drawing from the
experiences of other people. My fresh-
man year I lived alone in Graham-Lees
260, which I theorize was built as some

traces the evolu-
tion ofdining hall
entrees:

Day One:
Turkey slices wrapped around stalks of
broccoli.

Day Two: Chopped up turkey and
broccoli combination.

Day Three: Pureed turkey/broccoli
served with dumplings.

Day Four: Green .lelI—O.

Now, ifyou’ve heard enough, and if
you want to know where good food is
served, go where the truckers go, and
voila you have the Lee—Hi truck stop,

1

where waitresses will serve you 24
hours a day, seven days a week. We’re
talking waitresses that never sleep or
go home. They just watch the proces-
sion oftruckers, townies (er. .. Lexing-
ton citizens), and students who come in
to eat.

Sometimes the sleep deprivation
puts them on the edge and they’re not
quite as friendly as you might expect,
like when they throw your silverware
at you. But that’s OK; what they lack in
service they make up for eye makeup.
We’re talking Tammy Faye Bakker
territory. Or Uncle Fester from The
Addams Family.

But that’s not the point here, and the
point is, I don’t aimlessly wander from
subject to subject. Any subject I dis-
cuss, trust me, relates back to food in
some way and getting back to when
you go to Lee-Hi, you must always
have breakfast, preferably “The Gen-
eral Lee.” I won’t tell you what it
consists of (you have to find thatout for
yourself), but I will tell you I give it
five stars. (Edit0r’sNote: Richard gives
Stop-In convenience store chili dogs
ﬁve stars also, so maybe you had better
not trust his judgment.)

I’m out of space now, but look for
my commentary in the future. l’ll close
by saying: ladies and gentlemen, as
you pull down the covers and get into
your new bed tonight, questioning why
in the world your parents have left you
all alone at Washington and Lee, have
faith that in a short time you’ll be
questioning how your ever considered
any other place to go to school.

And to the current resident of Gra-
ham-Lees 260, call me here at the Phi
sometime and let me know if the old
homestead has changed much.

W&L sports gear up for 94 fall season

By STEPHEN WILLIARD
Phi Sports Editor

Each fall, every team in every sport
opens the year at 0-0. Where they go
from there depends upon the skill of
the players and coaches.

This year Washington and Lee ﬁelds
teams in four men’s and three women’s
sports. The Generals take to the water,
the court, and the ﬁeld in football,
soccer, cross—country, volleyball, and
water polo.

After a disappointing 2-8 ﬁnish last
season, the Generals have reason for
optimism this year on the gridiron.
After six narrow defeats last year, head
coach Gary Fallon returns eighteen

starters including second team All-'

Americandefensivetackle Robert Hull.

The offensive squad was hurt by the
loss of running backs Tom Mason,
who carried for over 1,000 yards last
season, and Wilson Moore, as well as
offensive lineman John Surface. Re-

turning are sophomore quarterback
Brooks Fischer, junior tackle Robert
Turner, and a stellar receiving core
includingJames Urban, Hayne Hodges,
and William Propst. The ﬁrst contest
for the Generals will be against Emory
and Henry on the tenth.

One of the most talented teams at
W&L is women’s cross-country.
Coach Jim Phemister returns almost all
of last year’s squad, including two-

time All-American Josephine Schaeffer‘

and two-time all region runner Amy
Mears, as well as co—captains Kim
Herring and Sue Deutsch.

Last year, the Generals placed sec-
ond in the South region last season
while winning their second straight
Old Dominion Athletic Conference and
state titles.

On the men’s side, coach John
Tucker ﬁelds a team centered on youth.
Leading the team are junior co—cap-
tains Tom Fink and Jeff Zeiger. Also
returning are sophomore runners Sandy
Hooper and Alvin Townley.

Football prepares for the fall season. The Generals look
to improve on last year’s 2-8 performance with the help
of several returning starters.

Both teams will open the year at the
Lebanon Valley Invitational on Satur-
day September 10, before their first
home meet against Mary Washington.

The men’s soccerteam returns seven

starters from last year. Leading the
returnees will be junior striker Shag
Drewrywho led the team in goals (7)
and points (17) last season. Also re-
turning are juniors Jeb Wofford, and
Chad Dobbins and senior Kevin Hock-
mg.
Coach Rolf Piranian returns a strong
defensive squad, led by tri-captain Alan
Christiansen, an All-ODAC midﬁelder.
Senior back Paul Wright will also aid
the defense. Anthony Mazzerelli re-
turns in goal as well.

The team looks to improve on a 5-
13 mark that dropped W&L out of the
top four in the ODAC for the ﬁrst time
ever. With the returning starters and a
strong freshman class, the Generals
could once again return to conference
prominence.

Women’s soccer will try to improve
on a solid second place ﬁnish in the
conference last year. Coach Jan
Hathorn returns a solid core ofdefend-
ers from last year’s team. Sophomore
keeper Beth Mozena leads the defense
after notching eight shutouts a year
ago. Backs Marina Jackson and
Stephanie Terwell will also lend their
experience. .

The team will have to deal with the
losses of Corinda Hankins and Angie
Carrington. Senior Anne Spruill and
sophomore Jenni Grant will shore up
the midﬁeld and Michelle Bauman will
be relied on for scoring after leading
the team in goals last season with six.

The W&L volleyball team will be
looking to move into the top ranks in
the conference for the first time this
year. The addition of assistant coach
Brenda Davis from Guilford should
help the team in the pursuit ofits goals.

The team returns captains Jennifer
Garrigus and Cheryl Taurassi as well
as a strong nucleus of players from last
year’s squad. One returning player
who wasn’t on the team last year is
junior Chrissy Hart who missed last
year with a knee injury.

W&L water polo has a strong tradi-
tion. The ﬁrst order ofbusiness for this
year’s team will be to replace senior
leader Greg Golub. Last season Golub
tallied 73 goals and 38 assists for the
Generals as they captured the Division
Ill Eastern Water Polo Association title.

Coach Paige Remillard does return
a deep team with a great deal of expe-
rience. Two All-Americans, Reuben
Munger, a second teamer, and David
Silvester, a first teamer, will be called
upon to lead the Generals in their quest
of a third straight Division III crown.

Overall the fall season holds prom-
ise for all the athletic squads at Wash-
ington and Lee. Each team has the
potential to turn in a solid season, but
only the test ofa full season can show

who will respond to the challenge.

The fall season last year was a
successful one for a number of the
teams at W&L. Those teams look to
remain at the top ofthe heap, while
some, like football, and soccer, look
to return to the upper echelons ofthe
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
and continue a strong tradition of
athletic competition at W&L. Each
team has set its own goals. It is those
goals which are important.

‘FOC welcomes class

By MICHAEL HEWLETT
Phi Staff Writer

With the largest freshmen
«class in recent years, the Fresh-
man Orientation Committee is
attempting to make the transition
from high school to college a
little less overwhelming.

I.‘ Dennis Manning, Dean of
Freshmen and Residence Life,
said he was impressed with this
year’s freshmen class and their
participation.

“I think we had very enthusi-
astic and spirited participation
and attendance in all of the pro-
grams,” he said.

Manning said there have been
_some minor changes in freshmen

Aorientation to make the adjust-

ment easier for freshmen.

He said a new program called

Mandatory Fun 101 consists of

ice breaking games that serve as

vehicles for freshmen to know
each other.

Dean of Students David
Howison and Executive Com-
mittee president Kevin Webb
served as facilitators for the pro-
gram on Saturday, September 3.

On Friday, September 2, there
was an overnight hiking trip spon-
sored by FOC and the Outing
Club.

Manning said that 106 fresh-
men applied but only 40 students
were chosen. Underclassmen
from the Outing Club and FOC
served as leaders.

He said juniors Meagan
Femstrum and Peter Wiessman
and Outing Club Director
Marshall Follo helped organize
the trip. Manning hopes to repeat
and expand the program, possi-
bly contracting with outside or-
ganizations such as Outward
Bound.

Another new activity is a com-

munity service project. He said
he had talked to a couple of fac-
ulty members who felt that it
would be a meaningful activity.

He said it served as a way to
introduce the W&L tradition of
community service and to bridge
the gap between the college and
the local community.

The Freshmen Field Day was
a success. Manning said juniors
Bryan Boland and Tom Fink set
up the volleyball nets and the
tug—of-war.

He said 75 percent of the fresh-
men class was present.

Manning said he was struck
by the level of commitment
upperclass students showed for
their school.

“At most schools the institu-
tion has to offer enticements to
get upperclassmen to help fresh-
men to move in and get ac-
quainted with the school,” said
Dean Manning. “I don’t know of

of1998

any more obvious affirmation of
love of alma mater than what I
witnessed on Saturday and
throughout orientation.

Senior Drew Hammond, com-
mittee co-chairman, said the ori-
entation went rather smoothly.
He said seniors Kris Fegenbush
and Sue Krawchuk did a good
job organizing the orientation.
He said the orientation helped
the freshmen adjust to their new
environment. He said this is the
best class he has seen in a long
time.

“This is the most diverse class
and the best class we’ve had aca-
demically,” he said.

Manning said the dorm coun-
selors and Building and Grounds
deserve much credit for a suc-
cessful freshmen orientation.

“Bill Radford, Bill Elswick,
Randolph Hare -— these people
are the unsung heroes of every-
thing we do programmatically.”

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

 

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

September 9, 1994

Heatley brings
$1 million suit
against W&L

By SARAH GILBERT
Phi Executive Editor

Nathan Rick Heatley, former associate dean of
students and direct of career development and
placement, filed three new suits totaling $2.35
million in his ongoing battle with Washington and
Lee over his dismissal in 1993.

The largest suit is against W&L, for $1 million,
and Heatley alleges that he suffered
several breaches of contract and a
wrongful discharge in his termination.

“The defendant [Washington and
Lee] tenninated Mr. Heatley’s employ-
ment without just cause,” stated
the suit.

One of Heatley’s other suits names
as defendants‘ Gwen and John
Handelman. He alleges that the
Handelmans slandered him and ac-
cused him of unprofessional conduct
in the performance of his job duties.

The third suit names Beverly Lorig,
Tyler Lorig and Ruth Lewis. Heatley
claims that Beverly Lorig and Lewis
wrongfully accused Heatley of sexually harassing
them, and that as a result, Tyler Lorig threatened
the university withhis own resignation unless they
would terminate Heatley. A

These suits are all the progeny of an original suit
Heatley filed against Lyn Wheeler last winter
for sla-nder, which has not been acted upon
since January.

The suit against Washington and Lee is based
upon the precepts in the personnel handbook, fac-

 

Heatley

ulty handbook and student handbook. Heatley al-
leges that he was asked to resign without a proper
hearing and without being informed of the true
nature of the charges against him: that he had bee
sexually harassing Lorig and Lewis. ‘

“While the rumors of sexual harassment quickly
spread through the University and surrounding
community, Heatley was left voiceless, unem-
ployed, and wearing the ‘scarlet H’ of a sexual
harasser,” Heatley’s brief stated.

Washington and Lee’s arguments
include a motion for demurrer, whic
means that, though the facts may be as
the plaintiff states, they do not sup-
port the contention based upon them.
The university claims it does not have
to be held to the policies on sexual
harassment outlined in the student
handbook when dealing with a mem-
ber of the faculty.

Heatley’s rebuttal ofthis argument
included the clam that, because there
is no policy for sexual harassment in
the faculty or personnel handbooks,
the university must be bound to the
statement in the student handbook.

Ahearing regardingthe University’s motion for
demurrer will be held in Covington Septmeber 30;
an article in The News-Gazette was of the opinion
that the suit would be thrown out of court.

Rockbridge Circuit Court Jude George E. Honts
Ill, ’68L, has excused himself from the case.
His son, Joel Honts, is a Washington and
Lee sophomore.

‘ Judge Duncan Byrd, Jr. will hear arguments
in Covington.

Dean of Fun plans

no way anti-Greek and has the
interests of all the students

gland College, where she was
president of her senior class. She
also has a masters degree from

Some of you may have no-
ticed a new office in the Univer-
sity Center displaying a message
board and the name, “Michelle
Richardson” on the door.

Or maybe you have seen her
on campus and thought she was a
new student. Already mistaken
for a member of the class of ’98
by the incoming freshmen,
blonde, blue-eyed Ms.
Richardson is not a student at all,
but rather the new student activi-
ties director at Washington and
Lee University.

Starting this year, the “Dean
of Fun” will be responsible for
“coordinating student activities
and helping students plan and
implement a comprehensive pro-
gram of social, cultural and rec-
reational activities here at W&L,”
according to Dean of Students
David Howison.

These responsibilities sound
remarkably similar to those
shared by the members of the
student activities board. In fact,
students might wonder why they
need yet another dean on this
campus to assist the students.

Richardson feels that the need
for her position may be due in
part to the dominance of the
Greek system over the social
scene at Washington and Lee
University. She believes that stu-
dents who are not in fraternities
or sororities may find this school,
well, less fun.

Dennis Manning, dean of
freshmen and residence life, says
that the few students who left last
year may have withdrawn from
the university because they

“found the social situation
dissatisfying.”

Richardson, therefore, is plan-
ning activities which will have a
more universal appeal for stu-
dents, activities which may in-
clude trips to Washington, D. C.
to see plays and a coffee house
where students can gather and
listen to student bands.

And, though she has a small
budget of her own to work with,
Richardson is working closely
with the student activities board,
the minority students association
and other student-run organiza-
tions. All in all, she stresses that
she is, “not here to step on any
toes.”

The new Dean of Fun is a

Springﬁeld College.

With counseling experience
and a new perspective to offer
the school, Richardson feels she
is very suited to organizing stu-
dent activities at W&L.
Richardson encourages students
to approach her with any ques-
tions or helpful ideas they
may have.

Michelle Richardson, the new Student Activities
Coordinator, is looking forward to this year.

Robb offers to steal food from widows
and orphans

Opponents of U.S. Senator Charles Robb are pleased with a recent
remark the democratic incumbent made about tax increases. Robb said, “I
would take food out of the mouths of widows and orphans if I had to,” to
solve the problem of the rising federal debt. Political analysts say the
remark was a mistake, though Robb maintains he was trying to show where
he would get the funding for the debt, something he says his opponents have
yet to do.

The Campus

PiKa’s lose two Rush baimers

Two banners for Pi Kappa Alpha’s Rush have disappeared from party
locations according to PiKa President Allen Galespie. One of the banners
was taken down before a party at “Munster,” a student home. After the
party, it was discovered that the homemade banner was gone. The other
banner was removed from outside a third ﬂoor window in the PiKa House.
The banner had been tied to the radiator inside the house. Galespie thinks
it was fraternity rivalry or someone who got really drunk and “thought it
would be funny.” He said tit was not a big deal because they were
homemade banners, not high-quality manufactered ones.

Sigma Nu gets a Rush violation

Sigma Nu was placed on a week of social probabation and ﬁned $1500
for a Rush violation.Sigma Nu was punished for violating the rule requiring
three different fratemitites be present during the casual contact parties.
Sigma Nu President Steve Inman said the violation was “more or less a
misunderstanding,” and that they “didn’t violate the spirit of Rush.” The
violation occurred when one of the members of another fraternity left for
a brief time to get some food. The probabtion ends this coming Tuesday.

Students allege pepper gas attack by
Lexington Police

On Saturday, September 3, students said that the Lexington Police
Department sprayed pepper gas on a crowd gathered at “Aqua Velva,” a
student home, near the intersection of Randolph and Henry streets. Accord-
ing to one student the crowds were sprayed with pepper gas twice, until they
were finally dispersed around midnight. Chief Bruce Beard of the Lexing-
ton Police Department denied all knowledge of the incident. ‘‘I have not
heard anything about pepper gas being used by my officers. If they had, a
report would have been filed,” said Chief Beard. He also said that pepper
gas is not their nonnal method of student dispersal. “I saw the cops holding
something and next thing I know is that everyone starts coughing,” said
sophomore Deborah Zollmann.According to Mike Young, director of
Washington and Lee Security, the Lexington Police ofﬁcers thought that
pepper gas was sprayed by students. He also commented that they were not
even sure if any pepper gas was sprayed into the crowds.

Only 37 percent of class of 1994

still unemployed says CD&P

By EMILY BAKER
Phi Staff Writer

The class of 1994 is enjoying a
healthier job market, according to
the Career Development and Place-
ment Office. More students of last
year’s graduating class have moved
onto jobs or graduate programs than
the previous class had by this point.

The CDPO issues surveys to each
graduating class every few months,
beginning when seniors pick up their
cap and gown at the end of May. As
of the end of August, the CDPO has
had an 85% response to the
first survey.

Of the responding students, so far
23 percent have gone onto graduate
or professional schools. Another 39
percent have jobs or internships that
might lead to permanent positions.

This combined percentage of 62
is an improvement over that of the
class of ’93, which at graduation had
only 40 percent ofthe class employed
or enrolled in grad school.
Thirty-seven percent of the class
of ’94 reported they were still

seeking employment.

Beverly Lorig of the CDPO cautioned
that these are only preliminary figures,
and will probably increase with each
new survey.

“Many seniors don’t start their job
search until after graduation...Many take
the summer off and begin the job search
early in September,” said Lorig.

Internships are becoming increasingly
effective beginnings for careers, accord-
ing to Lorig.

“Intemships may be a good way to get
a foot in the door [at companies],” she
said. “They offer a chance to prove your
skills and abilities to employers.”

Survey responses have shown that ’94
grads are having luck with small to me-
dium size companies. Eighteen new com-
panies, many of them small, recruited at
W&L this past year.

“Students are finding desirable posi-
tions at these smaller companies,”
said Lorig.

She noted a definite improvement in
the job market.

“lt’s looking better,”she said. “We’re
not totally recovered from the recession
of the ’80’s, but this is an indication
of recovery.”

“Grunge-free

-show,” said guitarist Brad

by MELISSA SAWYER
Phi Features Editor

The Hoodoo Gurus are com-
ing to Washington and Lee’s
pavilion this Saturday.

This Australian group in-
cludes Dave Faulkner, brad
Shepherd, Rick Grossman and
Mark Kingsmill. The band
recently released their sixth
album, Crank.

Aself-proclaimed “grunge-
free” album, Crank is a mix of
steely guitars, locomotive
rhythms and throaty vocals in
13 songs—the most ever on a
Hoodoo Gurus’ domestic re-
lease. Crank also includes
guest performances by former
Bangle Vicki Peterson and Red
Cross singer Steve McDonald.

Songs from Crank to listen
for on Saturday night include
“The Right Time” and “The
Mountain.”

“Sound-wise this record
(Crank) is probably the most
representative of our live

Shepherd. “There’s always

been a big difference between our records and
the way we sound live, to the point where it’s
almost like two separate entities. When we get
on the stage we create an extra energy that gets
lost in the studio.” '

‘‘I find the rock opera phenomenon of the
late 70s to be a bit laughable, so I thought l’d do
atakeoff on it,” said lead vocalist Dave Faulkner.

“Open My Eyes” is a homage to puppy-love
pop, a la the Partridge family. Composed by
Shepherd, the tune features vocals by Vicki

Wachtler’s double life revealed

Linda Wolfe's book probes scandal surrounding former W&L student

by MELISSA SAWYER
Phi Features Editor

Linda W0lfe’s “Double Life” is the
real-life story of the shattering affair
between New York Chief Judge Sol
Wachtler and socialite Joy Silverman.

Wolfe exposes the two’s long—last—
ing affair and Wachtler’s criminal be-
havior that lead to his harassment of
Silverman.

While this book reads largely like a
  insert, it is of inter-
est to Washington and Lee students
because Sol Wachtler attended W&L
for both his undergraduate and law
school work, starting in 1947.

Wolfe brieﬂy describes the W&L
campus as “bucolic...(one that) rolled
across a hundred acres shaded by an—
cient trees and dotted with handsome
Greek Revival-style columned build-
1ngs.”

Wachtler decided to attend W&L
after he was denied admission to Yale
University.

He was a campus leader, his frater-
nity president, and held prominent po-
sitions in the Literary Society, debate
team and the Forensic Union.

He even received an inter-fraternity
council award reserved for the student
“who has contributed most tom cam-
pus activities.”

Wachtler was later elected presi-
dent of W&L’s Bar Association.

This is the story of corruption and
deceit that shocked and bafﬂed Ameri-
can people.

It is a story that should especially
bafﬂe students of W&L, accustomed
to the honor code and its high standards
of character.

How could a man so prominent as a
student here have gone so astray after
forty-one years of marriage and de-
cades of a successful career?

The forty-two year old married
judge, a father of four, had led an
apparently unblemished life until he
vented his rage at Joy Silverman in a
torrent of obscene letters and phone
calls — and threatened her young
daughter as well.

"You better hope I die soon because
ifl don't you‘ll wish you were dead,"
wrote Wachtler in a letter to Joy
Silverman, ripped up by him and found
by the FBI just before his arrest.

Wachtler, who had been appointed

term and expelled from the New York

Wolfe's rendition of the Wachtler
affair is blatantly written in the style of
such T.V. shows as A Current Affair

The narrative has few substantial
twists.

Also, prologue elicits much the

delivered throughout the remainder of
the story.

Wolfe’s Double Life is compiled
from hundreds of interviews.

She is also the author of Wanted:

Natural Born Killers —- Two Stars

Natural Born Killers, Oliver Stone’s latest over-induI-
gence, continues in the same vein as his other films of years
past: The Doors, JFK, etc.

Once again he has created a visually stunning and
cinematically amusing piece with pretensions to deep
thought.

Typically, Stone takes some timely subject, distorts and
manufactures facts, and ends up with a very controversial
and powerful piece.

Here, though, he was working from a script (originated
by the brilliant Quentin Tarantino) which was only an echo
of reality, so he does very little actual ly lying.

The story revolves around a young married couple,
Michael and Mallory Knox (Woody “The only surviving
member of Cheers” Harrelson and Juliette Lewis), who go
on a three-week rampage across America, killing every-
thing in sight—

got stuck playing a dim—witted bar-keep for so many years.

Jack Scagnetti, who finally arrests the couple and in the
end is killed by them in the riot, is played to a T by Tom
Sizemore.

He manages to keep the role, which like the others in the
film might easily sink to silliness, from falling into pure
schlock.

Unfortunately, the same can not be said of Tommy Lee
Jones, who brings absolutely no sadness or reality to his
enthused but demented warden.

Imagine either his character from The Fugitive or The
Client, only in the style of a televangelist: over-the-top,
pompadoured and devoid of badly needed irony.

The same can not be said of Stone’s directorial efforts.

He has applied the irony not with a brush but with a
dump truck.

The film quickly becomes Bonnie and Clyde meets the
B-52’s or Deee-Lite: a visually startling, emotionally trou-
bling farce of itself.

Many seem to wonder how Stone could have gotten
Warner Bros. to release a film of such incredible violence
(for example, Mallory burns her own mother to death).

But the violence of this ﬁlm is neither immature like
Friday the 13th nor intellectual as in Schir.'dler’s List.
Rather, it is hyper-cool, like an MTV remake of Faces of
Death.

Stone makes the violence and the terrora laughable, silly,
pathetic scene.

The death and destruction become very black comedy,

tentiary, whose

be Tommy Lee
Jones.

Is itjust me, or
does Tommy Lee
seem to figure
prominently in
most of the mov-
ies released these
days?

At any rate, in
jailthe story shifts
to the efforts of
sleaze-bag jour-
nalist Wayne Gale
(played surpris-
ingly well by the
normally annoy-

three-week spree.

At asmall road-
side cafe, they
mercilessly kill
five or six people
whoseonlycrimes
are bad taste or
manners. But
Stone makes the
killings overly
clever — not ultra-
violent, but ultra-
cinematic.

Finally the inter- imP0Sed 33916503-

view sets off a riot,
ending the
warden’s trem-
bling, clutching grasp on life, as well as the lives of most of
the prison guards.

The prisoners break free, inspired by Michael’s pseudo-
philosophical, quasi-poetic testimony to the “purity” of
murder. In the end Michael and Mallory manage to escape,
killing Wayne Gale before his own camera. '

It is clear this movie could have provided a very curious,
thought-provoking look at modern America.

For example, when Wayne Gale is killed by the escaping
duo, is it a testimony to the media’s true impotence, show-
ing us journalists as mere recorders, like the camera which
filmed Gale’s impromptu execution?

On the other hand, the couple were only provided with
a chance at escape because of Gale’s ratings—driven inter-
view.

Perhaps Stone is trying to say that the media is slowly
choking itself with trash?

And, as passable as the story-line is, the acting is decent
as well.

Woody Harrelson continues to make us wonder how he

tom of the screen.
Then he shows us
blood splattering
against the cafe wall. Stone doesn’t run from the violence;
in fact, he embraces it.

But he embraces it by highlighting the bizarre or ironic
or trivial moments, as when Mallory, ﬂeeing down the
highway in a convertible, shoots a bronze medal cyclist who
happens to be going down the same road.

In sum, Oliver Stone has created a movie tailored for
Generation X —— fast, furious, funny, but still depressingly
real and violent and sexual. He uses incredibly fast cuts, an
extremely evocative soundtrack, and over-doses of cultural
irony and self—awareness.

Stone doesn’t develop the plot, or the characters, or the
issues, he just focuses on his directing.Unfortunately he has
over—done that, and so Natural Born Killers is a beautiful,
witty, black but incredibly pretentious ﬁlm, meant to ad-
dress you and me.

Despite his credentials as a rebel, Stone fails to find the
youth in any but the most superﬁcial ways, and we are left
feeling like we just watched a Burger King commerical
where Dan Cortes decides to kill the drive-thru worker.

Elite Titian-tum lﬂhi

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

Are we physically fit yet?

We hate to belabor a point, but...we have a problem with
the whole physical education requirement here at Washing-
ton and Lee.

No one is a bigger proponent of sports and the necessity of
staying in shape than the editors of T he Ring-tum Phi are, but
we wonder if the current system really serves its purpose.

Is it beneficial to punish hard-working but single-sport
athletes by requiring them to take valuable time from their
busy schedules to learn a sport which they will very probably
never use? Does this enrich the students of Washington and
Lee University?

With 60 percent student participation in varsity athletics,
not to mention a healthy intramural competition, the last
thing the administration should be worrying about is physi-
cal education credits.

There is also a very limited array of sports to be learned,
as well as a very limited time to learn them in. A very valid
alternative might be to allow students to fill their require-
ments by pledging to have completed a certain number of
exercises in a sport not taught by the department. Those
students who were avid mountain bikers, scuba divers, rugby
players or rock climbers could opt out of the squash classes
by doing something they enjoyed on their own time.

This could also relieve some of the headaches the first day
of classes, when students who want the prime spots in P.E.
classes must rise with the birds.

Students should also be allowed to propose their own
sports and even volunteer to teach a section which would fit
into more schedules. Because most of the physical education
professors are coaches, late afternoon P.E. classes are non-
existent, and student-taught sections could be scheduled for
the afternoon slots which many more non-athlete students
have free. g

Another good plan would be to allow athletes who play a
varsity sport for four years, even if it is only one season (and
most sports are in training of some sort for six months or
more every year), be completely absolved of the require-
ment. You can bet that a four-year soccer player is in good
shape and has aquired some of that great well-roundedness
that liberal arts universities are so famous for.

Take the executive editor of The Ring-tum Phi as an
example of someone who does not need a physical education
requirement. She has competed in ten or twelve different
track and field events, indoor and outdoor, for going-on four
years. She mountain bikes, skis, and lifts weights in her spare
time. Yet our senior editor will have two more physical
education classes to schedule into her already busy senior
year. Is this absolutely necessary?

Though the student body has been meekly decrying the
physical education requirement for years, nothing has been
done to change the requirement and all of our bright ideas
have seemed to fall on deaf ears. Can something be done?
This has gone on long enough.

Live from Washington: my summer

DREAM LAND
Richard Weaver

I bet you were wondering what I did
this summer, besides eating, shower-
ing, watching TV, and planning my
new show in Las Vegas. Well, l’ll tell
you.

I worked for Accuracy in Media in
Washington, D.C., an organization
whose mere mention made several of
the journalism school professors al-
most spill their coffee. The summer
was quite an education.

My friend-, Andy, my betta ﬁsh,
Betta Theta Pi, and I shared a room in
what I believe was a converted crack
house in Arlington, down the street
from Washington-Lee High School.
Our room was tastefully appointed,
free of charge, with red carpet, a red
vibrating lounge chair with a leopard-
skin cover, portraits of semi-clad
women on the walls, and an old guy
across the hall who was seeking asy-
lum from Sweden.

“Things are not all right over there
[in Sweden],” our landlord, Mrs. Beach,
said.

The Swede and we shared a kitchen
that came complete with an appetizing
mothball fragrance and a refrigerator
that arbitrarily defrosted itself if we put
food inside.

We also shared a bathroom, the
condition of which made me seriously
consider bathing in public fountains in

front of the Capitol as an alternative.
Above the Swede and us lived The
Cross-Eyed Guy and the guy we saw
waving a metal detector over the front
yard one night after dark. I suspected
the two lived in a symbiotic relation-
ship, where the Metal Detector Guy
followed The Cross-Eyed Guy’s direc-
tions to ﬁnd buried treasure in the yard
(which The Cross-Eyed Guy couldn’t
see).

and Andy. We would stand up in the

MY VIEW

Paul D. Saboe, ’97

Washington and Lee University has long been
associated with meaningful words such as honor and
excellence. The spirit of honor fostered by President
Robert E. Lee under the guidelines of the Honor
System has endured to this day, thanks primarily to

the mindful dedication
of students past and
present, a true testimony
to how sacred honor is
held at this institution.
In addition, Wash-
ington and Lee Univer-
sity has become identi-
ﬁed with another impor-
tant word, service. The
students of Washington
and Lee have neverbeen
strangers to service.
They have always
shown their commit-
ment to others through

community and school related service projects. How-
ever, never has the ﬂame of service burned so brightly
in the hearts and minds of all those who attend this
university as it does today. Alpha Phi Omega, the Big
Brother/Big Sister organization, the AIDS Aware-
ness Association, and the University Federation are
just a sampling of the many Washington and Lee
sponsored organizations that are devoted to service.
The students who participate in these organizations
and others like them have clearly taken to heart the

words of the late Arthur Ashe:

“True heroism is remarkably sober, very undra-
matic. It is not the urge to surpass all others at
whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever

cost.”

This spirit of service that characterizes Washing-
ton and Lee is indeed commendable. General Wash-
ington and General Lee would both be honored to
connected to an institution such as ours where stu-

dents pursue and practice the Rotary motto of “Ser-
vice above Self.” Yet, now is not the time for loud and
hearty congratulations, but rather the time for quiet
and careful meditation and action. Now more than
ever we must expand our service efforts and reach out
to more of those in need whether they are a homeless
person with no place to sleep or a young child having
trouble understanding basic addition.

At Washington and Lee we are being groomed as
the leaders of tomorrow and no where is that leader-

bots’ property values. If I was lucky,
the neighborhood children would be
watching and then I could make scary
faces too. See, Mom, I am capable of
entertaining myself.

There was always the exciting
Washington nightclub scene. I found
most nightclubs to be hot enough in-
side to melt the black paint and grafﬁti
off the walls and evaporate the $8 cup
of water that someone under 21 could
purchase for refreshment.

This was a tactic to force members
of the audiences to sweat so much that
they would become delusional and start
banging into each other, crowd surf-
ing, gouging eyeballs, etc. as a way of
displaying their musical appreciation.

Speaking of gouging out eyeballs,
in July I had a superpower summit
meeting with Betsy Green in Lexing-
ton. Through my translators I proposed
that we divide the town into two sec-
tors, because two Phi humor colum-
nists can’t exist in the same territory
without dying off (we’re like deer that
way).

Here’s my proposal: Betsy gets
Gaines Hall and the old ROTC build-
ing, and I get everything else in Lex-
ington and good chunk of Raphine. If
Betsy crosses into my territory, stu-
dents will be entitled to confront her
and demand her to sing a rendition of
Pearl Jam’s “I’m Still Alive” as retri-
bution. Betsy will also be required to
cook them a complete Spam dinner.

lt’s going to be a good year in Dream
Land.

EC approves $295,545 budget

By SARAH GILBERT
Phi Executive Editor

At 3:30 a.m. this morning, the Executive
Committee voted upon the complete version of
their $295,545.44 budget.

After 39 student organizations requested
funds totaling $372,451.78, the EC was forced
to cut roughly $80,000 from organizations as
diverse as the Preston Society and Men’s Panel.

After preliminary deliberation, the EC was
able to reduce the budget to $298,879.24, and

‘ continued to reduce the budget further, but will

not release the pared-down version until this
afternoon. The committee will vote again Sept.
26 after student groups have had a chance to
view the proposed budget.

The most bitter debate in the EC office last
night concerned the funds requested by the
Student Bar Association.

fees that undergraduate students do, but the

Undergraduate and law
members of the EC dif-
fered greatly in their view-
point on the SBA, and the
$45,000 requested was
hotly debated.

Many undergraduates
felt that they were “subsi—
dizing” the law students’
social opportunities and a
question was made of
whether the law students
should get a ﬁgure equal to
their contribution in stu—
dent activities fees.

After subtracting $25
per student for the Student
Pavilion, a fixed expense
that was contracted by the
1984 EC, the law students
contribute $40,700.

As this number was

problem of a non—coincid-

three weeks before the un-
dergraduates), the EC de-
cided to go with that fig-
ure.

Other large allocations
included the Student Ac-
tivities Board, which
landed $70,000 after pre-
liminary deliberations. The
EC members were pleased
with the ideas and enthusi-
asm of this year’s SAB
leaders.

“There is a lot of energy
pumping through the SAB
right now,” she said.

The SAB plans to have
new activities to appeal to
every student, such as a jazz
band and comedians.

The Calyx, which lost
$12,000 last year, was given
$26,000, about $8,000 more
than last year, with precau-
tionary advice on raising
more funds this coming
year.

Busy Rush schedule
entering final week

By MICHAEL HEWLEIT
Phi Staff Writer

All but 10 freshmen males are busy investigat-
ing fraternity houses in this year’s newly organized
Rush.

Senior IFC president Kevin Batteh said Rush is
going very well. He said the Rush schedule was
rearranged this year. Last year freshmen had open
contact where the fraternities could do whatever
they wanted with the freshmen such as hiking in the
country or going to ski resorts. The freshmen then
had open houses where they visited all the fraterni-
ties for thirty minutes each. After that, they turned
in preference cards and formal rush began.

This year, freshmen males visit all the houses
first. Then they have open contact before formal
Rush starts. Batteh said the open house dates were
pushed to the weekends so freshmen could concen-
trate on their academic work.

Senior IFC vice-president Christopher
Lamberson said the administration wanted Rush to
be shorter this year to prevent freshmen from being
distracted from their work.

Lamberson said last year the open houses didn’t
serve their purpose.

“Open houses are meant to show freshmen all
the 14 houses,” said Lamberson.

Lamberson said that becauseopen houses were
two weeks later last year, freshmen already had
some preferences before they had seen all the
houses.

IFC treasurer senior Brian King said IFC mem-
bers have been monitoring the Rush process to
make sure the parties are dry (i.e. no alcohol.) He
said this rule is new in being fully enforced this
year. He said if something were to happen to the

freshmen, the whole fraternity system could be
held liable.

He said the members also make sure that at least
three houses are present at any fraternity party
during open contact.

. Kingsaid the Rush cou_nselor§,_ who take the

freshmen to the open houses, also make sure there
are no Rush violations. The Rush counselor system
was implemented last year.

Still some of the freshmen males ﬁnd Rush to be
a little overwhelming.

“After about the 13th open house, it gets a little
boring,” said freshmen John Harper.

Freshmen Robert Hughes had similar feelings,
but he said he enjoyed it nonetheless.

“It’s overwhelming going to ﬁve houses at
once,” said Hughes. ‘‘I knew it would be a way to
meet some people. I just wanted to check out things
and see what was going on.”

Harper said he is rushing because he sees spe-
cial beneﬁts in joining a fraternity.

“I think they constitute the majority of your
social life, “ he said. “You also get lifelong friends.
When you graduate, you get a network through
other chapters if you’re looking for a job.”

However, some freshmen males decided not to

rush. Freshmen Jason Sorens said he had some,

problems with the fraternity system.

“I feel it’s kind of a way to buy friends,” he said.
“I prefer to pick and choose my own friends.”

He also said he considered the financial costs of
joining a fraternity and decided it wasn’t for him.

“I don’t think I’m losing out,” he said. “Every
time they had Rush, I was out with my friends.”

Freshmen Michael Bailey said he decided not to
Rush because of time constraints with basketball.

“I don’t think it’s [Rush] the thing for me,” he
said.

Sullivan brings new
insight to law school

. By SARAH GILBERT
Phi Executive Editor

“The challenging thing in le-
gal education is, how should law-
yers be trained? and what is the
function of law school?”

Barry Sullivan has recently
joined the Washington and Lee
law faculty, as dean of the law
school, with a commitment to
“the continuum of legal educa-
tion.”

“We ask what are the respec-
tive responsibilities of the legal
profession and the law school,
and where do you strike the bal-
ance,” Sullivan said in an inter-
view with the Phi. “We must
realize that it is all a continuum,
what I call the continuum of legal
education, and we are only a part
of the continuum.”

A very successful lawyer and
an experienced educator himself,
Sullivan is in a great position to
help strike that balance at Wash-

ington and Lee Law. Sullivan
comes from his position as a part-
ner at Jenner & Block in Chi-
cago, where he worked for 13
years after his stint as assistant to
the solicitor general of the United
States with the Department of
Justice.

He graduated cum Iaude with
honors from Middlebury College
in 1970 and received his JD.
from the University of Chicago
in 1974, where he was associate
editor of the University of Chi-
cago Law Review and National
Honor Scholar.

Sullivan’s W&L connection
come from his clerkshipwith U.S.
Circuit Judge for the U.S. Court
of Appeals, John Minor Wisdom
’25. Wisdom recommended
Sullivan to the search committee
which later decided to offer
Sullivan the deanship.

Sullivan has reacted very posi-
tively to Washington and Lee
and says that he appreciates the
emphasis of the faculty.

“We have a terriﬁc faculty
committed to teaching and inter-
ested in research, without being
inordinately interested in one or
the other,” he said. “Many of our
peers in terms of ranking exalt
research over teaching; we don’t
do that.”

He was also very interested in
the honor system at Washington
and Lee.

“The honor system is really a
part of what the university is about
and what the law school is about,”
said Sullivan. “When you enroll
in the law school, you are mak-
ing a commitment to be a person
of honor for the rest of your life.”

Sullivan is very committed to
instilling the students of the law
school with a sense of honor.

“The legal education is not
just about acquiring a certain
body of knowledge,” he said. “A
profession dedicated to the pub-

power or face consequences. US aircraft carriers headed toward the
Caribbean appear to signal an imminent invasion of Haiti.

Cuba and U.S. reach agreement

ln an agreement reached last Friday, the US agreed to allow in at least
20,000 Cuban immigrants a year. Cuba promised to stop the mass exodus
from the country. The police ban on ﬂeeing the country has cleared the
beaches for the first time in weeks.

Population conference sets goals

At the U.N. population conference in Cairo, 180 nations endorsed a
program designed for slowing population growth. The conference focused
on birth control and economic development. During the conference, U.N.
officials handled objections from Muslim countries and the Vatican
dealing with reproductive rights and abortion.

Presidents of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia
meet to work out federation government

The presidents of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia met this week to try
and save from collapse the federation the two governments formed six
months ago. The federation was intended to unite the Croats and Muslims.
The organization has not yet resolved its differences, though leaders of
both nations were optimistic after talks Tuesday.

Pilot of plane that crashed into White House
was legally drunk at the time

The truck driver who crashed his plane into the White House grounds
Monday had cocaine and alcohol in his system when he died. Frank
Corder’s blood alcohol content was .045 percent, above the .04 percent
limit for pilots. Corder’s accident, believed to have been a suicide attempt,
has raised questions concerning White House security.

Clinton signs crime bill into law

President Clinton signed the crime bill into law Tuesday and appealed
to American citizens for their help in implementing it. The law bans certain
types of assault weapons and allows the death penalty for more federal
crimes. At the ceremony outside the White House, Clinton urged Ameri-
cans to help their communities and law enforcers to make the new law
effective.

Baseball strike ends the season early
The Baseball season was prematurely ended Wednesday, for the first

time since 1904. '-Sources said little hope was left for the season because -

of the strike. The baseball commissioner officially announced the end of
the season Wednesday afternoon during a conference. The baseball season
has not been canceled in 90 years, hanging on through world wars and
depression.

Lt. Governor Beyer asks for an end of parole
for violent criminals

Lt. Governor Donald Beyer said Tuesday that Virginia should end
parole for violent offenders now instead of waiting for the govemor’s plan
to abolish parole next year. Governor George Allen said early parole for
criminals already in jail would be impractical and lead to many lawsuits.
The Govemor’s plan would end parole for those convicted of crimes
committed after January 1st.

Annie Lee’s Body Moved to Lexington

The remains of Annie Carter Lee were the only ones from Robert E.
Lee’s immediate family buried outside of Lexington, and a North Carolina
health director has finally given the go-ahead to have the remains exhumed
and brought back to Lee Chapel.

Annie Lee was buried in Warrenton, N.C. when she died of an illness
while taking shelter during the Civil War. The descendants of Lee
attempted to have her body brought to the family crypt in Lee Chapel after
reports of vandalism at Annie Lee’s gravesite.

Health Director Dennis Retzlaff says the exhumation can go ahead if
none of Lee’s descendants object. He is still in the process of contacting all
of them.

New law dean brings rich experiences

done, between him and the death penalty, for a crime
he may not have committed. Surely, Justice Holmes
was right when he said that one can live greatly in the
law.”

Sullivan’s experience in the legal world has been
largely appellate, consisting of taking cases which
had already been decided in trial courts on to appeals
courts, at the district, state and federal level.

The cases he argued and for which he wrote briefs
were as varied as civil rights and a series of cases on
railroad re—organization.

The railroad reorganization cases occupied much
of his time, and c0nc'ern'e'd so many unusual points of
law that they were often brought to appeals courts.

“It got to the point that most of the cases cited by
both sides in these issues were precedents which I had
argued or written briefs for,” said Sullivan.

For the future, Sullivan has no changes or im-
provements planned for the law school, but he does
plan to teach a spring semester course on Supreme
Court practice, in which students will practice argu-
ing and writing opinions on cases that will be coming
up before the Supreme Court this year.

He also plans to teach an undergraduate course,
perhaps in the 1996 spring term, as a way of bringing
his experience to the other side of the bridge.

Right now, however, he is content to remain
wholly in his role as dean.

_ “l’m glad that l’m not [teaching],” he said. “I’m
finding the administrative job enough to fill my
plate.” »

CD&P Gets
New Look

it CD&P, from page 1

“They will be more interactive and
hopefully allow students to know them-
selves better.”

At resume workshops, students will
break into groups and critique sample
resumes, a change from the usual lec-
ture format of the workshops.

The first resume workshop will be
September 19 from 4 to 5 PM, and the
first interviewing workshop will be the
21st, also from 4 to 5 PM. Both are in
room 109 of the University Center.

Future plans for the CDPO include
“an invigorated outreach to the fac-
ulty,” said Lewis. “We want to support
them in their departments and ask them
for their support” with opportunities
for students.

The CDPO tentatively plans to add
their services to the Liberty network.

“We’re hoping to create a database
of internship opportunities that stu-
dents can access without leaving their
dorm rooms,” said Blackburn. _

The staff emphasized that the office
is for students of all grades, not just
seniors.

“No matter what position they’re
in, students need to make the most of
their resources,” said Lewis.

“We’re serving as the turning point
where students are moving from jeans
and Tevas to a more professional im-
age,” said Lorig.

So far, the staff has received posi-
tive feedback from students and fac-
ulty on the new office.

“We hope it will be a place that
students feel comfortable coming to,
someplace with an inviting feeling,”
said Lorig. “We’re here to help.”

The cupola of the Gaines Hall Gatehouse got a new coat of paint this week. Scott W.
Beebe, the Director of Special Projects for Buildings and Grounds said that the
repainting was just “routine maintenance.” He said that B&G tried to match the
original color as close as possible. It was the first time since the construction of
Gaines that the Gatehouse was painted.

Phi News Editor

The old Italian game of Bocci has
returned to Lexington for another year.

Washington and Lee Bocci Ball
Commissioner David L. Howison offi-
ciated the second round of the 1993-94
Bocci Ball Tournament on Thursday.
Four teams competed for the right to
advance to the third round of the tour-
nament. The Dorm Counselors placed
first, followed by The Ring-tum Phi.
The International House came in third,
and T heSpectator, represented only by
senior Allen Gillespie, finished
dead last.

Howison declined to comment on
who would advance to the next round.

For those unfamiliar with bocci, it is
played with one small ball, the palina,
and eight larger bocci balls. The goal
is to place as many balls as possible
closer to the palina than the other team.
The game does require some skill to
get the bocci balls near the palina,
although j unior Paul Howe of the Dorm
Counselors felt that luck was also a
factor in the game.

It is unclear what other teams re-
main in the running because Howison
has refused to comment on the status
of any teams.

Gillespie tried hard, coming close to a positive score, during the round of double point
play, his balls rolled outside the playing area, causing him to get eight negative points.

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

The DIP/DUI question...

One undeniable fact at Washington and Lee University
is that our bright and beautiful students occasionally
choose to let loose from the strictures of their studies,
have a few beers, and generally make fools of themselves
in the name of fun and relaxation.

As many of these students are of age and legally
capable of doing whatever they deem necessary with
alcohol to relieve all that pent-up energy, we at the Phi do
not have a huge problem with this.

The administration and even the police have verbally
supported our rights to occasionally get, shall we say,
wasted.

Unfortunately, the most popular spots to imbibe in
Lexington are not the same as the spots most students
choose to sleep.

In other words, after one becomes under the inﬂuence,
one must finds one’s way home.

We like to be optimistic, but no one can believe that, for
every drunk person in Lexington during a given night,
there is a willing and available and sober and car-
possessing designated driver.

Often, there is no one who even fits one or two of the
necessary characteristics for conveying an intoxicated
person home.

So, our mythical, 21-year-old, model student decides
to walk home.

After all, this is a small town. Better to risk a few
stumbles along the way then to get behind the wheel of
two tons of unpredictable steel. Right?

Wrong. Lexington’s finest are on the first street comer
past the Palms, and bring our model student back to what
we like to call the slammer to spend the night.

Because he or she decided not to risk endangering
other people’s lives and the possibility of a “driving
under the inﬂuence” arrest, the student is slapped with a
“drunk in public.”

What purpose does this charge serve but to punish

people for choosing not to drink and drive?

If someone is belligerent or passed out in the middle of

Nelson Street, the police would be justified in taking him
or her in. But in the case described above, the usual case,
there is no justification.

How can we avoid the situation? It is not against the

law to become inebriated.

Lexington police, however, have made it effectively

against the law to become inebriated anywhere outside
the privacy of one’s own home.

liberal in bocce (sic).”

missioner and World is Leader in Bocci Wisdom, after
Spectator athlete Allen Gillespie sent his fourth out-
of-bounds ball rolling down the Collonade for triple
negative points.

THE EVOLUTION

TRA DI TION , , .

U.S. has vested interest in Haiti

At a seminar I attended this summer the question
of Haiti came up; one of the professors suggested that
the United States could and should just ignore Haiti.

The logic behind his state-
ment is obvious. Haiti has

neither nuclear weapons
nor a sophisticated army;
it provides no imports we
cannot get elsewhere, and
Haitian-Americans’ politi-
cal force is non-existent.

 

“political” refugees the U.S. automatically let in until
last month, one will ﬁnd that many Haitians qualify
under the heading of “political” refugees than many
of the Cubans currently at
Guantanamo. This is not to say
that Castro has not persecuted
people for political reasons;
however, as far as I know,
Castro has not advocated wan-
ton torture and murder of inno-
cent people to the extent the

Despite my great reluctance to advocate military
action of any kind, anywhere, I believe invasion is
the only option. I do think it should be an invasion
followed by an almost immediate withdrawal to
avoid charges of American imperialism. The mili-
tary dictatorship should be removed from the island
but only under guidance of the United Nations. If
one looks at the crimes that have been committed
since Aristide’s removal from office, I think Cedras
and other top ofﬁcials could justiﬂably be charged
with crimes against humanity. Under no circum-
stances should we repeat the mistake we made with
Noriega, arresting them under U.S. laws to be tried

Why isthere evenathought military dictatorship of Raoul
of invasion? Cedras has.

The answerto that ques- So why don’t we simply let in U.S. courts.
tion is that we do have a the embargo drivethe dictator-

stake in the future of Haiti. Currently, the U.S. gov-
emment is paying to keep Haitians in detention cen-
ters in Guantanamo. Whether we like it or not, our
money is irrevocably tied up in the future of Haiti.
There is also a more personal side to this. Many
families have been separated by the ban on immigra-
tion from Haiti. These are families who may have
been in the U.S. for years. who have contributed in a
positive way to American society. During my senior
year of high school, a girl, who was still a Haitian
citizen, was called back to Haiti to visit a sick relative.
Despite the fact that she and her family had lived in
Miami for several years, she was not allowed to return
to the U.S. In this time of emphasis on the family, it is
wrong that we are breaking apart families because of
when and where they are emigrating from.

We can also no longer hide behind the excuse that
the Haitian emigration is the result of purely eco-
nomic problems and not political. Admittedly, Haiti’s
economy leaves a lot to be desired; however, I think
if you look at the circumstances of many of the Cuban

refugees, their first com-
plaint about Cuba is the
economy. The majority
of United Nations mem-
bers have recognized the
futility of the Cuban em-
bargo and want the U.S.
to open up trade with
Cuba. Most moderate
Cubans feel the same
way; unfortunately their
voices are drowned out
by the radical exile com-
munity in Miami. If we
simply keep the embargo

from Haiti in the future?

ship out? A few decades ago we instituted a embargo
against Cuba — Castro is still in power. Now, if you
listen to the complaints of the majority of Cuban

on Haiti in place, won’t we be laying the foundation
for an eventual exodus based on economic reasons

The second goal of such an invasion should be to
set up free and open elections. I do not think
Aristide should automatically be put back into
office. It has been approximately four years since

cue--—

I f we simply keep the embargo
on Haiti in place, won’t we be
laying the foundation for an even-
tual exodus based on economic
reasons from Haiti in the future?

Aristide was elected,
almost time for a new
election. If the Haitian
people want Aristide
back in ofﬂce they will
vote for him. At that
point, once the new
president is in ofﬁce,
there is no reason for
an American military
personnel to be in Haiti
except if they are on
vacation.

Perhaps then we can
return the Haitians we

are holding at Guantanamo to Haiti. We can use the
money to help Florida take care of all the immi-

grants that were let in prior to the August blockade.

U.S. does not need to invade Haiti

Al Gore has become the latest mem-
ber of the Clinton Administration to
restate that “one way or another,” that
is, by force of arms if required, the
military regime in Haiti will be re-

pansion of democracy has always been
an important goal of U.S. foreign policy,
it has never been our sole objective. It
is simple-minded to assume that we are
preparing to invade Haiti simply be-

credibility not trolled by a
only of the ad- small party

ministration but also of the United
States has been staked on the success
or failure of a third-rate military junta
now governing one of the world’s most
obscure nations.

Given this bluster on the pan of
Clinton and his subordinates, we can
take it virtually for granted that an
invasion will occur if the military
regime is not dissolved within the com-
ing months. Basic questions still re-
main, however, even if the course of
U.S. policy is now set: are we right to
place such a high priority on the resto-
ration of democracy in Haiti? And,
even if this is a worthwhile goal, is
Father Aristide the right man for the
job?

We might answer the first question
by making it clear that, while the ex-

elite. Why do we not invade these na-
tions as well? The answer is, of course,
because doing so would be hard.
Clinton may indeed be devoted to de-
mocracy for its own sake, but it is no
coincidence that he has chosen one of
the weakest countries in the world upon
which to demonstrate his zeal. We
should recall that while U.S. troops
stand ready to invade Haiti in order to
restore democracy there, we are also
negotiating amicably with the govem-
ments of Cuba and North Korea.
Also, China’s status as a “Most Fa-
vored Nation” trading partner was re-
cently renewed — a curious commen-
tary on our embargo policy against the
Haitian generals. The lesson here is
that Clinton is only a starry-eyed, gung-
ho partisan of democracy when it suits

him. Whether or not forcibly fostering
democracy is, in the final analysis,
worth the sacrifice of American lives is
something I leave to the reader to de-
termine on his own.

And what of the doubts about Fa-
ther Aristide? First it needs to be said
that Aristide’s followers are not very
sophisticated or forgiving people: many
of them can be expected to demand
their pound of ﬂesh should their leader
ever regain power. Aristide ’s infamous

conclusive reasons to believe that a
U.S. invasion could ever put an end to
rightist assassinations (we can’t even
put an end to murders in our own capi-
tol, let alone anyone else’s). Further-
more, the killing set off by a return of
Aristide to power could be just as un-
palatable.

We have yet to learn whether a U.S.
invasion of Haiti could ever achieve its
objective of a stable, democratic gov-
ernment there. It may be instructive to

OPINION

Riding the job circuit to Moline

GREEN LAND
Betsy Green

A belated hello and welcome to my
column. I’m sure all of you are fasci-
nated by every aspect of my glamour-
ous life, so I’ve decided to share with
you a dark, moldy chapter of my life:
my summer. Consider it the memoirs
of a Working Woman.

When I was forced to leave Lexing-
ton, The City That Never Sleeps, for
Moline, Illinois, City of A Thousand
Forbidden Delights, I quickly found
myself jobless and broke. My brother
had just obtained a wonderful temp
job. The Boy was paid eight dollars an
hour to sit at the airport holding a sign
that said “John Deere” on it. (It may
interest you to know that in addition to
being the City of A Thousand Forbid-
den Delights, Moline is also the Farm
Implement Capital of the World. I kid
you not.) Inspired by The Boy’s good
fortune, I trekked over to the temp
agency to ﬁnd a job to supplement my
exciting career in the dynamic world of
French fashion. In other words, my job
as a sales associe at Express was not
paying me enough. I was amazed at
how quickly the agency found a job for
me. In retrospect, this should not have
suprised me, considering that the only
qualiﬁcation needed was to own a pair
of steel-toed boots. Armed with my
steel-toed boots and determination, I
began my summeras a working woman
at a factory called Export Packaging.
What was I thinking?

My day began at four in the mom-
ing. This is not a good thing for some-
one who has trouble going to an 8 a.m.
class (Sorry, Professor Hall). I wore
really old jeans, a W&L shirt to remind
me of better times, and a hideous pair
of brown safety glasses. My duties
were not too demanding. In essence,
the monolith that is Export Packaging
is a division of Caterpillar. I took small
tractor parts like bolts, screws, hoses,
and big heavy yellow thingies out of
boxes, counted them, divided them by
destination, and put them in other boxes.
A dolphin could have been trained to
do this. I was paid ﬁve dollars an hour.
The perks included my very own marker

and stapler with little tags on them that
said “Elizabeth G.”

You can imagine the skills I picked
up on this job. I learned that bolts are
really heavy and greasy. I can now
operate a hand jack. I know how to use
a time card. Most importantly, I can
waste time like a champ. Each task
required about two seconds worth of
paperwork. My precison stretched that
time out to about four minutes. If I
needed to get new boxes, I carefully
studied each box before taking it back
to my work table. I also spent a lot of
time staring blankly into space.

My job was not a pleasant one. It
was tedious, and to use an industry
term, “icky.” These
problems were com-
pounded by my su-
pervisor, Margie.
Margie is about thirty
years old and has
worked at Export

tered an environment in which I take
no pride in my work and consequently
make the occassional error.” I thought
better of it and shrugged. I was prob-
ably more upset by Margie than I should
have been. I was complaining about
how Margie thought I was stupid when
my co-worker Phil, who wore signifi-
cantly more jewelry than I did to
accesorize his Manson shirt, said,
“Dude, if your supervisorthinks you’re
dumb, then go with it, man.” A good
point. The next time I accidentally sent
5,000 Heavy Concrete Things to
Melbourne instead of Morton, Illinois,
I said, “Oops. Messed up again. What
can you do?” Margie fumed, but seemed
to accept this
answer as the
truth.

E x p o r t

really not the

rather hard to respect someone who
comes to work wearing shirts that say,
“Don’t [Unprintable] Talk to Me. I’m
Stressed,” and “Midwest Regional

tender.”

Margie alsoseemed to ﬁnd me mind-
numbingly stupid if I ever missed any
of the intricacies of tractor parts. One
day she came and screamed about a
quarter of an inch away from my face,
“What the [obscenity] are you think-
ing, you [naughty word]? You really
[deleted] [deleted] this time! Why did
you [fornicating] get this wrong?” I
considered telling her the truth, some-
thing like, “Well, Margie, I guess the
reason I made a mistake was that your

about drugs,
gin, and serial killers. The most fright-
ening of all was a weird guy whose job
it was to take out the trash all day long.
I was cheerfully counting buttons one
day when a strange guy came up to me.
I had never seen him before. He said,
“Betsy?”

“Yeah?” I answered blearily.

“My name’s Paul.”

I waited to see what Paul had come
to talk to me about, and found that that
was it. Furtherpondering the situation,
I found it weird that he knew my name.
Margie, who had worked with me ev-
ery day, did not know my name. Baffled
by how I could be both Betsy and
Elizabeth, she gave up. I was pretty
sure that Paul also knew my social
security number and what my score on

the math section of the SAT’s was.
Later in the day, Paul came up to me
again.

“Betsy?”

“What?” I asked. Bear in mind that
all I have ever said to Paul was “Yeah?”
and “What?” Apparently I said it well,
because he then asked me out.
“Ummm... I can’t. I’m, ummm,
Amish,” I answered. Paul ran away in
fear and never spoke to me again. What
could I do? His career was emptying
trash at Export Packaging, and his bi-
ceps were about as big around as my
wrists. Come to think of it, Paul is a lot
like Richard Weaver, only with a job.

In a way, I learned a great deal about
labor-management relations from my
work. The ofﬁces of the managers were
air-conditioned, but the places where
all of us toiled, lifting heavy objects,
were not. Every once in a while, the
management attempted to appease us
with popsicles. I tried to rally my fel-
low workers together and to open their
eyes to the oppression in front of them.
“Can’t you see?” I screamed, “They’re
just trying to keep us happy so they
don’t have to invest any real money in
our safety! They’re just trying to...
Hey, they have green ones!”

I’m sure all of you are wondering
how I tore myself away from this won-
derful job to go back to W&L. It wasn’t
easy, but one day I snapped. It was a hot
day. I was tired and had not had time to
eat my nourishing meal of a whole lot
of coffee before work. I was not in a
good mood.

Margie came over to me and said,
“You’ve been [inappropriate for a pub-
lication] sitting down too [not up toPhi
standards of journalistic integrity] much
on this job. I don’t want you to sit down
for the rest of the time you work here,
including on your breaks.” I was, to put
it mildly, enraged. I couldn’t sit down?
What was she going to do, follow me
into the bathroom to make sure I was
standing? I waited until the whistle
blew for my ﬁrst break, returned my
coveted stapler and marker, wrote
“Herein Lie The Seeds Of Revolution”
on my work table, punched out, and
left without a word to anyone. I was
free.

The memoirs of a working woman.
They’re not pretty, but they’re true.

  Manning thanks freshman orientation aides

To the editor:

I would like to take this opportunity to thank
publicly the entire W&L community for providing
such an enthusiastic and supportive welcome to the
Class of 1998 during the freshmen orientation pro-

gram.

Of particular importance was the work of the
Freshmen Orientation Committee, and its leadership,
Sue Krawchuk, and the Dormitory Counselors, all of
who gave unﬂaggingly of themselves. Planning and
organizing orientation activities and stafﬁng virtually
every orientation event — from Mandatory Fun 101
to airport shuttles — made for a very smooth opening

week.

Thanks also go to: Mr. Bill Elswick, Mr. Randolph

Hare, Mr. Bernard Butler, and their staff who saw to
it that all of the dormitories and other facilities were
in immaculate condition for check-in day; Mr. Jerry
Darrell and Mr. John Taffe and their staff who fur-
nished the culinary touches for several meetings and
special occasions; Jim Farrar, Rob Mish, Chris Main,
Kathekon, Southern Comfort, JubiLee, General Ad-
mission and Gordon Spice for the Alumni Associa-

tion BBQ.

Special kudos to Sue Krawchuk for her extraordi-
nary work with virtually every aspect of orientation;
Tina Hand for her work with the Freshmen Record;
Ms. Joan Neel and the APO Service Fraternity for
excellent leadership of the community service activ-
ity; Professor Kirk Follo, Megan Femstrum and Peter

Weissman and the Outing Club for organizing the
overnight hike; Dean John Elrod for his thoughtful
reﬂections on academic life at W&L and Professor
Taylor Sanders for his insights into the history and
traditions of W&L; Kevin Webb, Professor Lamar
Cecil and the Executive Committee for a meaning-
ful orientation to the Honor System.

Others too numerous to mention also contrib-

uted to the freshmen orientation program, and this

general note must sufﬁce as a thank you. I am
pleased that the Class of 1998 was the beneﬁciary
of such a community effort!

Security director warns
of new Virginia laws

Dear Students:

While you were gone over the sum-
mer holiday the laws of Virginia
changed regarding drinking and driv-
ing in this state. There are several sub-
stantial changes that have toughened
the DUI statutes. You need to know
these changes:

1. The Blood Alcohol Content level
has been reduced to 0.08%. You are
legally considered to be driving under

the inﬂuence if your BAC is 0.08% or, ~
higher. If your driving in1_paired,_-=

(accident, moving violation, etc.), you
could be convicted of DUI if your BAC
is lower than 0.08%.

2. If you are under 21 years of age,
driving with a BAC of 0.02% but less
than 0.08%, (this could be as little as
1 1/2 to 2 beers), is punishable by a ﬁne
of up to $500 and a six months driver’s
license suspension. This is a ZERO
TOLERANCE statute.

3. If your license has been sus-
pended for an alcohol related offense
and you are found driving, the vehicle
you are driving will be impounded
immediately for 30 days. The court can

impound the vehicle for an additional
90 days upon conviction.

4. As of January 1, 1995, your
driver’s license will be automatically

Vrevoked for _7 days if you are found

driving with a BAC of 0:08%, or if you
refuse to submit to a breath test.

5. Also beginning in January, you
will no longer have the option of re-
questing a blood test instead of a breath
test for an alcohol offense.

It’s pretty easy to see that Virginia

-has become very serious about drink--,,._

ing and driving. Every year some of
our students are arrested for DUI and
those students have not found that to be
a very pleasant experience. With these
changes in the law, it will be much
easier for you to be in violation, if you
choose to use alcohol. The choice is up
to you, but the penalties are severe.

DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE
HAVEADESIGNATED DRIVER

Sincerely,
Michael L. Young
Director of Security

Emory and Henry spoils Generals opener.

By STEPHEN WILLIARD
Phi Sports Editor

Washington and Lee was hoping for
a different story line from that of last
year. Emory and Henry once again
played the wicked witch as the Wasps
again spoiled the season opener for the
Generals.

A While game was a rough one for the
Generals offense — W&L turned the
ball over six times—the defense showed
signs of living up to its preseason prom-
ise.

The running game was never able to
quite get off the ground as W&L’s lead-
ing rusher, J .P. Josephson accumulated
only 39 yards. The Generals are still
looking to ﬁll the shoes of Tommy Ma-
son and Wilson Moore in the backfield.

Sophomore fullback Aaron
Wilkinson left the game early with a
sprained ankle as well.

The return of wide-out William Propst
threw a positve light on the afternoon.
Propst caught six passes for 61 yards in
the contest.

“I thought they played with a lot of

79

enthusiasm, commented head coach
Gary Fallon.

The defense will be relied on to pro-
vide the spark this season based on the
number of returning starters.

“We went into the season thinking
on paper that was our strong point,” said
Fallon.

Fallon also said that the team will try
to throw the ball more often to take some
of the pressure off the mnning game.

According to Fallon, the team will
try to take the season one game at a time.

“Our biggest goal right now is to beat
the next opponent,” said Fallon.

Fallon expects the team to be greatly
improved from last season.

“We’ve got more seniors and juniors
dominating the starting roles,” stated
the veteran coach.

Despite the loss, Fallon remained
optimistic about the season.

“I think it’s going to be a real good
year for us, regardless of how the wins
and losses come out,” remarked Fallon.

The Generals have the week off be-
fore facing Centre College on the 24th.
W&L will be looking to avenge last
season’s 21-15 loss to Centre.

W&L Hall of Fame honors new inductees

BY KEITH GRANT
Phi Staff Writer

Washington & Lee could be
called a university of names.
Buildings, ﬁelds, dormitories,
and plazas all across campus
bearthe namesofﬁgures promi-
nent in the school’s history.

Most of these names, if not
the people, themselves, are
known well to members of the
university. It is understandable,
though, that some of these me-
morials get overlooked, particu-
larly when located deep inside
the Warner Center, like the A.
E. Mathis Wrestling Room.

But Archie Mathis has
moved up in the world. The late
W&L wrestling coaching leg-
end was one of the four 1994
inductees into the Washington
& Lee Athletic Hall of Fame.

The Hall of Fame, estab-
lished in 1987, increased its
membership to 32 with the in-

duction of Mathis, Brian Bell’49,
Skeet Chadwick’74, and Pat Den-
nis’78 at last Friday night’s cer-
emony in the Evans Dining Hall.

Mathis coached the W&L
wrestling program to national
prominence upon taking over the
four-year old program in 1925.

After accumulatinga 17-year
coaching mark of 80-21 -3,
Mathis was killed while serving
the country in World War II. Six
of his former wrestlers also gave
their lives in the war.

A man whose career included
nine unbeaten seasons and four
Southern Conference champion-
ships was probably best described
in a letter to the W&L Athletic
Hallof Fame Committeethat was
read at the induction ceremony
by Professor of English, George
Ray.

The letter was written this
passed summer by Rosa Fletcher
Crocker, the daughter W&L
legend,Forrest Fletcher.

Crocker wrote of a circus that

once came to Lexington during
her childhood. The ringmaster
was trying feverishly to get a
challenger to go one-on-one with
his “Wild Man.”

“Up got a man who made his
way_down the bleachers to the
center of the ring, taking off his
coat and tie as he went,” the letter
said.

“I well remember a great
cheer which went up when that
audience saw who had gone
down; and although I was not
wearing a timekeeper’s watch, it
could not have been more than
half a minute before the Wild
Man was tightly pinned to the
ﬂoor, by Archie Mathis.”

Mathis’ ﬁnal team at W&L,
the 1941-42 squad, ﬁnished a
fittingly perfect 6-0.

Bell was a football and base-
ball standout for the Generals
and had the privilege of playing
for another of W&L’s Hall of
Fame coaches, Richard “Cap’n
Dick” Smith.

W&L water polo set out on their quest to regain the EWPA title with a 2-2
split at the W&L Invitational against Richmond and Queens College. The

Generals defeated the 16th ranked Richmond team in the final game.

 

Water Polo splits in tourney

BY STEPHEN WILLIARD
Phi Sports Editor

Expectations are always high
when you are the defending
champion in your sport.

The Washington and Lee wa-
ter polo team was confronting
the challenge of a return to domi-
nance this past weekend in the
W&L Invitational.

The Generals opened the tour-
namentwithacome-from-behind
11-10 win versus Queens Col-
lege.

In the second game, the Gen-
erals fell to Richmond in over-
time 16-14. The third game saw
a fatigued squad lose 19-7 to
Queens.

16th ranked Richmond did not
long enjoy their victory, as the
Generals rebounded to defeat the
Spiders 10-8 in the ﬁnal game of
the weekend.

Head Coach Paige Remillard
was pleased with the overall per-
formance of the weekend.

“We played three games on
Saturday and the fatigue and drain
certainly reared its ugly head,”
remarked the coach.

Stars for the Generals included
senior Reuben Munger and jun-
ior Frank Braden who each scored
four times against Queens in the
ﬁrst game.

All-America goalie David
Silvester also stepped up his per-
formance for the weekend, cul-
minating in a 15 save effort
against Richmond in the ﬁnal
game of the series.

Remillard thinks that the loss
of All-American Greg Golub
actually helps the team in some
respects.

“Now if you shut down one
player, someone else is there,”
said Remillard. “That has been a
smooth transition.”

This coming weekend the
Generals face their toughest test
of the young season as they jour-
ney to Annapolis and the Eastern
Water Association Tourney.

The Generals will be compet-
ing against three top twenty-five
opponents in Princeton (19),
Navy (14), and Slippery Rock
(22). _

“Now we’re playing at a very
strong national level,” said
Remillard of the coming week-
end. “If we win a game, I’m a
happy guy. If we win two, I ﬂoat
home.”

When asked about the com-
ing season and the quest for a
repeat EWPA title, Remillard
remarked that Johns Hopkins was
probably the favorite to take the
crown.

However, he summed up the
spirit and tradition of the team by
adding, “If they take it, they’re
going to earn it.”

Smith reportedly called Bell
“the ﬁnest athlete I ever coached
at Washington & Lee.”

As a baseball player, Bell
earned all-state honors in 1947,
1948, and 1949.

In ’48, he batted .419 with a
Southern Conference-leading six
home runs and a still-standing
school-record of 22 stolen bases.

His most memorable play as a
collegiate came on the football
ﬁeld. While returning a kickoff,
Bell was aided by a
photographer’s ﬂash that appar-
ently caused two University of
Richmond defenders to tackle
Bell’s lead blocker. The 94-yard
return for a touchdown was one
of the Associated Press’ sports
oddities of the year.

After playing football brieﬂy
with the Washington Redskins
and Detroit Lions, Bell was on
the verge of singing a baseball
deal with the New York Giants
when he suffered a career-end-
ing knee injury.

In more recent times, the other
inductees, Chadwick and Den-
nis, helped W&L chase national
championships in the ’70s.

A member of the National La-
crosse Foundation Hall of Fame
in Baltimore, Chadwick was one
of the best goalies in lacrosse
history.

He was voted the nation’s out-
standing goalie in 1974 and
helped the Generals to the Divi-
sion I NCAA semiﬁnals both his
junior and senior seasons.

“By our junior year, Skeet
was the foundation of the team,”
said formerteammate Ted Bauer,
himself a Lacrosse Hall of Famer.

Bauer, always quick to knock
that team’s defense, described
Chadwick’s remarkable indi-

New assistants aid teams »

Four Washington and Lee ath-
letic teams opened the year in
1994 with a slightly new look.

Men’s lacrosse, water polo
and swimming, volleyball and
women’s basketball, and
women’s lacrosse and soccer all
have added new assistant coaches
to the staff this year.

KevinAnderson brings hisex-
perience as an All-American
midﬁelderfor Loyolatothe Gen-
erals’ lacrosse team. Anderson
starred for Loyola over the last
four years and played against the
University of North Carolina in

the 1991 national championship
game.

Coach Paige Remillard of the
water polo and men’s swimming
team will be aided by new assis-
tant Conrad Stuntz.

Stuntz was an All-American
at Bowdoin and captain of the
water polo team.

The volleyball and women’s
basketball teams will get help
from a former foe. Brenda Daivs,
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference player of the year in bas-
ketball and volleyball last sea-
son, will be on the side of the
Generals this season.

Davis brings the experience

volleyball programs in the con-

ference.

Jami Dansingburg will be a
new face on the W&L women’s
lacrosse and soccer teams this
year. Just as Guilford lost Daivs
to W&L, so the shoe was on the
other foot with former assistant
Sue Behme. Dansingburg is re-
placing Behme, who is now the
head coach at Sewaneefi.
Dansingburg was an all-region
goalie with William Smith last
season as Smith reached the
NCAA semi-ﬁnals.

All of the teams taking on’
new coaches are drawing from a‘
wealth of recent playing experi-
ence. Each coach should aid their
respective squads as they pursue
successful seasons.

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY September 23, 1994

VOLUME 94, NO. 3

:W&L ranked 15 by U.S. News

By EMILY BAKER
Phi Staff Writer

Washington and Lee’s ranking has
risen again in U.S. News & World
Report’s annual Best Colleges report.
W&L is now the 15th best liberal arts
school in the nation, according to
U.S. News.

W&L’s ranking went from number
22 in 1992 to 20 in 1993.

“This can be a very important as-
sessment for measuring quality,” said
Dean of Students David Howison.

About 1400 schools were divided

into categories. W&L, along with 163
other schools, belongs to the category
of national liberal arts colleges.

U.S. News asks the president, deans
and admissions directors of schools to
evaluate other schools in theircategory
based on academic reputation. W&L
came in at 9th place in this category.

“This is important,” said Howison.
“lt’s a reﬂection of how others see us.”

U.S. News then ﬁgures in the repu-
tation evaluations with statistics pro-
vided by the school. This year’s rank-
ing comes from statistics of last year’s
freshman class, the class of ’97.
These statistics concern student

selectivity, faculty resources, ﬁnancial
resources, graduation rate, and alumni
satisfaction. ,

Howison says the new ranking re-
ﬂects W&L’s investment of funds.

“We’re a good school,” he said.
“W&L has put its resources where, in
my judgment, are the right places: in
admissions, to get the best students,
and in support for faculty, to get the
best teachers.”

W&L came in ﬁrst place out of all
164 schools in the category of faculty
resources. This was determined by the
ratio of full-time students to full-time
faculty, the salary for faculty, and the

class size.

W&L’s score has risen in the area of
alumni giving to 54%. This is in-
creased slightly due to the Capital Cam-
paign, said Howison.

An increased retention rate has also
improved the score in the graduation
rank category, said Associate Director
of Admissions Dan Murphy.

“We’ve really made strides in the
percent of students graduating from
the university.”

The only number Howison ex-
pressed dissatisfaction with was the
ﬁnancial resources score of 54th place.
According to U.S. News, “a school’s

ﬁnancial strength was determined by
its ﬁscal 1993 expenditures for its edu-
cation program...divided by its full-
time-equivalent enrollment.”

“Here we are punished for our tu-
ition rate,” said Howison. “Relative to
other schools in our category, our tu-
ition is low.”

Neither Howison nor Murphy would
venture a guess at next year’s ranking.

“It varies from year to year,” said
Murphy. “We’re pretty ﬁrmly estab-
lished in the top 25, but as to exactly
where, I better not guess.”

“Once you get to the level we’re at,
it’s hard to separate schools,”

said Howison.

Howison did say he thinks this year’s
freshman class will raise the
ranking even more, especially the
selectivity rate.

While the class of ’97 had a 33%
acceptance rate, the class of ’98 had a
29% acceptance rate.All this praise for
the class of ’98 has some upperclass-
men doubting they could have gotten
into this year’s freshman class.

Howison disagrees.

“The quality of the students has not
changed. The quality has been good
from the moment I got here.” '

selves in calculus.

“Pictures are much more meaningful than a
complicated formula,” is Washington and Lee

mathematic professor Timothy
Murdoch’s belief. This senti-
ment won him a National Sci-
ence Foundation Leadership
Award for $77,775.

Murdoch, an assistant pro-
fessor of mathematics at W&L
since the fall of 1988, discov-
ered that these grants were avail-
able from the National Science
Foundation during a trip to Los
Angeles. Upon hearing about
them, he decided to outline an
idea and then submit a written
proposal to the foundation.

His innovative proposal is to
coincide with another recent
grant the mathematics depart-

ment received last year. This grant, chaired by
John Harer (who is now a part of the Duke
University staff), allowed them to purchase
computers speciﬁcally for the mathematics

department’s use.

With this new grant, Murdoch plans to cre-
ate software that will be used by the multi-
variable calculus students in the computer lab
individually and in class lectures as a teaching
aid for second-year calculus students. It is hoped

“Students don’t have a good ability to visu-
alize things about calculus,” said Murdoch.
With these computer programs, students
will be able to investigate vector calculus con-
cepts and learn to visualize
three dimensional shapes.
According to Murdoch, an
example of how this software
will be of use to the students is
in looking at integrals that have
more than one variable. These
integrals have very complex
shapes and so are not easily
comprehended. With the new
software, the computer can
project these shapes for them.
Murdoch did not believe
that he would receive the grant
and was both surprised and
excited when it was bestowed

Murdoch on him.

“The nice thing is that we

are doing something,” he said.
The software is being developed locally,
but with the hope that other colleges across the
country will see the results and become inter-

ested.

that the software will help illustrate what stu-
dents often have problems seeing for them-

Tear Night
approaches

By CINDY YOUNG
Phi Staff Writer

Associate Dean of Students
Leroy “Buddy” Atkins refers to it
as the ceremony surrounding “the
ﬁrst big decision a young man
makes on his own.” Dean of
Freshmen and Residence Life
Dennis Manning likens it to
“crossing a threshold.” The broth-
ers of all fourteen recognized fra-
ternities here on campus have
been planning it for a full year
now. W&L Security is gearing
up for it. And to the men of the
Class of 1998, it is fast approach-
ing, full of anticipation and prom-
ise: Tear Night ’94.

“Tear Night” derives its name
from days past, when a name tag
with one torn comer meant the
bearer had been bid upon; two
torn comers signiﬁed an intent to
pledge.

By all accounts, the night has
now evolved into a less formal,
and in many aspects, wilder party.

Each fraternity has laid plans
for what promises to be a memo-
rable night. Most plans include a
meal at the fraternity house, rang-
ing from a formal dinner to the
dishing-out of pizza, followed by
a party for active members and
the new pledge class.

Even with well—laid plans, and
best intentions on the part of fra-
ternity brothers, not to mention
the prohibition of alcohol con-
sumption throughout this year’s
Rush, W&L administrators’ an-
ticipation of Tear Night ’94 are

still moderate.

Mindful of colorful episodes
from recent years, Mike Young,
Director of Campus Security, will
consider this Saturday night a
success “if not one person is ar-
rested, gets sick, or is injured and
has to be taken too the hospital.”
To help achieve this goal, Young
promises to “increase patrolling
and heighten [Security’s] inter-
est” in goings-ons this weekend.

Chief Bruce Beard of the Lex-
ington Police Department said
the that Lexington’s police force
“will be beefed up,” for Tear
Night. Beard also said there will
be many more Alcohol Beverage
Control officers in Lexington
over the weekend. He advised
students to “be careful and don’t
be caught with alcohol.”

Also looking to Tear Night
with heightened interest are the
freshman themselves, some with
eagerness, others with hesitation.
To Brad Simpson, the night prom-
ises a “really memorable” expe-
rience. Scott Anderson expects
to ﬁnd a “big night,” after which
another freshman expects “you
don’t remember a lot.”

Scott Bookwalter and Ken
Theus voice for many others their
expectation of “a lot of drink-
ing.” To all freshmen alike, how-
ever, the night stands as the ﬁrst
step in their initiation into Greek
life.

To the men of the Class of

’98, advice comes from many
directions. Chris Lamberson,

U.S. troops watch as Haitian police attack pro-
American crowds in Port-Au-Prince

American soldiers watched as Haitian police attacked crowds of singing
demonstrators in Haiti’s capital Wednesday. The crowds gathered to sing
and cheer for U.S. troops arriving in Haiti. The U.S. so far has sent 7000
troops to Haiti to help restore exiled president Jean-Bertrand Aristide to
power. U.S. officials said U.S. troops are not there to intervene in
disruptions, except if they are a threat to civil order. Two demonstrators
were beaten to death.

Gunman kills eight in Beijing

A gunman in Beijing killed eight people Tuesday, including an Iranian
diplomat and his son. The gunman opened fire on a bus and several other
vehicles before being shot down himself and killed by police. The New
China news Agency did not report possible motives in the incident.

Volcanoes erupt in New Guinea

Nearly 30,000 residents of Papua, New Guinea ﬂed the region just
before two volcanoes erupted simultaneously. Ships picked up evacuators
ﬂeeing from the ash covered city. The volcanoes lay on opposite sides of
the harbor. Officials fear there were a small number of people still in the
city, but cannot get through because of broken communication lines.

No more cameras in federal courtrooms

Federal judges voted Tuesday to keep cameras out of federal court-
rooms. The panel of judges at the U.S. Judicial Conference turned down a
proposal to open all courts to a project that would allow cameras at civil
trials and appeals, and banned absolutely cameras at all federal trials. The
judges banned cameras out of a concern for the impartiality of judges,
juries, and lawyers at trials.

Saturated fat increases ovarian cancer risks

Eating 10 grams of saturated fat a day may raise the risk of ovarian
cancer by 20 percent, says a study published in the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute. Scientists have long suspected that saturated fat plays a
role in ovarian cancer, but this study offers solid evidence. The study also
adds that eating just two small servings of vegetables a day could offset that
risk. In another study, scientists found that women who average four hours
of exercise a week during their childbearing years have a 60 percent lower
risk of breast cancer.

EEOC drops religious harassment

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission withdrew its rules
regarding religious harassment in the workplace Tuesday. The regulations
were part of a comprehensive plan to eliminate harassment. The guidelines
proposed to ban all religious expression, both verbal and symbolic, in the-
workplace. EEOC officials estimate that more than 100,000 letters were
sent urging the organization to drop religion from its harassment guide-
lines.

USAir overworked plane engines

In an effort to get more use out of the engines of Flight 427, USAir ran

as part of a cost-cutting effort. All 132 people aboard Flight427 died when
it crashed September 8.

Shuttle forced to land in California

Wilder. Prosecutors say the pension fund broke securities laws when it did
not reveal its interests in buying R.F. & P. Corp., a real estate company. By
not disclosing their intentions, ofﬂcials were able to buy stock at lower
prices than they would have had they let known their interests.

Proposal X could cost twice projected price .

Proposal X, Governor George Allen’s plan to end parole, could cost
twice as much as previous estimates. The plan proposes the construction
of 27 new prisons by 2005, costing $1 billion. The House Appropriations
committee released a report saying that ﬁgure could range between $1.9 to
$2.2 billion. The General Assembly recessed Tuesday to hold hearings on
the matter this week.

Road sign
missing
at Hollins

BY JENNIFER LATHAM
Phi Staff Writer

After the Hollins College apartment
parties two weeks ago, a caution sign
was reported missing from Obenchain
Road, near the apartments.

But it was no ordinary roadsign.
Inside its yellow triangle was the im-
age of an emu and the words “emu
crossing - next seven miles.”

Tom Mesner and his wife, Jeanne
Larsen, received the sign as a gift and
will take it back with no questions
asked. Mesner said he suspects a col-
lege student stole the sign because
“(partygoers) got wild, or it was some-
thing they’d drunk.”

“It’s probably on some student's
wall,” said Mesner.

Mesner is Dean of Student Aca-
demic Affairs at Hollins, and Larsen is
chairman of the English department
there.

Mesner joked that the sign might
not have disappeared if it had warned
of the presence of a different animal.

“The emu is not a dangerous
animal...maybe next time we’ll put up
a sign with a rhinoceros on it.”

Amid all of the furor and excitement of Rush, there was
a refreshing change of pace this past Wednesday when the
ﬁrst “Acoustical Coffeehouse” was held in the GHQ. It is
just one of the many new ideas that the SAB and the “Dean
of Fun,” Michelle Richardson, have in mind for W&L’s
social calendar.

Similar to the popular MTV series “Unplugged,” it
allows striving artists to showcasetheirtalents in an intimate
atmosphere.

Complete with an assortment of desserts, cappuccino
and coffee, students packed in to hear W&L juniors Brian
Boland and Tommy Esposito perform. The smoky, Seattle-
esque atmosphere provided the perfect environment for
their style of music. With Brian Boland on guitar and
Tommy Esposito singing, they played an assortment of
cover songs. With selections ranging from blues and early
U2 to some classic rock, and the token Pearl Jam melody,
there was something for everyone.

The duo also played some original songs which were

‘T/I/éuli

“Acoustical Coffeehouse” s owcases talent

upbeat and well liked by the
crowd.

‘‘I try to keep a real posi-
tive attitude with the music I
write,” said Ikposito. ‘‘I
think a lot of the music today
is so negative and (have) so
much anger and hate com-
ing out. I take Pearl Jam and
Nirvana as prime examples.

I mean, why are they
so angry?”
The pair met last year dur-

ing spring term on the steps
of the Parkview apartments
and have been playing to-'
gether ever since. And they
are by no means strangers to
this eclectic, Seattle-coffee-
house type of perfonnance.
Although this was their ﬁrst
time performing for W&L,
they have played many times
at Harbs and the Raven and

Crown, receiving rave
reviews.However, it is not al-
ways easy for them to ﬁnd the
time to practice together.

With Boland majoring in
philosophy and classics and
Esposito in history, it is often
difﬁcult to set time aside for
music. “W&L is the kind of
place, as a singer and guitarist,
that I wish I went to a school
that was less demanding aca-
demically. lt’s hard to get the
practice time. But if you really
want it, you’ll ﬁnd the time,”
said Esposito.

Besides serving as a show-
case for new talent, the coffee-
house also gave an opportunity
for many students to meet with-
out being under the auspices of
fraternities or sororities. As
Esposito said, “I would hope
that it would become a sort of

 

PAGE 3

thing where it would bring together guys and girls that aren’t
normally hanging out, because they are always hanging out
at their fraternity or sorority. I’d hate to see that type of
clique attitude.” This is not the last you will see of these type
of shows.

Because of the positive response, Dean Richardson has
already scheduled additional coffeehouse performances for
October 7 and October 28. The ﬁrst will feature a singer
from Maine, tom Acousti, who was a competitor on the
television show Star Search.

The performance on the 28th will feature a group named
Settie, comprised of a female singer and two male guitarists
who sing cover songs by Melissa Etheridge, REM, Indigo
Girls and 10,000 Maniacs, among others. The acoustical
show is just one of the many new ideas which the SAB and
Dean Richardson are working on. One idea being consid-
ered is a day trip to Washington, D.C. this coming Novem-
ber, where students can see plays, visit museums and enjoy
what the city has to offer.

A RESU RQEN (E ill YO?‘ (U LPURE

By MELISSA SAWYER
Phi Features Editor

Lexington is not exactly a center of
the drug culture that has been sweeping
America for the last few decades. Some
things are apparently easy enough to
get, though, especially marijuana.

To most students, it’s hemp, grass,
pot, Mary Jane, or a variety of less
well- known terms. Along with its
various titles, the marijuana culture
has developed its own slang. The lingo
includes words like “cashed” (used-
up, no longer potent), “roach” (stub
from a joint), “hits” (inhalations) and a
variety of words to describe a user’s
condition after partaking in marijuana:
toasted, high, smoked out and popeyed.

Until recently, marijuana was syn-
onymous with the Sixties generation,
but a new “grass” roots movement is
being fueled in large part by pop cul-
ture — fashion, music and ﬁlm.

The funky grunge look was inspired
by early Seventies fashions and in part
by the cannabis leaf. The seven-point
symbol can be seen adorning every-
thing from earrings to T-shirts, belt

les and caps. Boutiques in L.A. and
New York are selling a line of clothing
called Weed Wear. There’s even the
Hemporium in San Francisco, which
sells hemp sportswear and related items
(all legal, of course).
Musical acts from proto-rappers
Cypress Hill to Southern hard-rockers
The Black Crowes are singing about
hemp. In a Time magazine article, B-
Real of Cypress Hill, who confesses to
smoking pot every day, said “We’re
the newest to hit with it. We’re revital-
izing the pot movement.” And the
Black Crowes, whose lead singer Chris
Robinson once posed for the cover of
High Times magazine smoking a joint,
perform under a 48-ft. by 24 ft. banner
emblazoned with a marijuana leaf.

In film, 31-year-old ﬁlmmaker Ri-
chard Linklater, in honor of pot culture
classics like Blow Up and Easy Rider,
directed Dazed and Confused. The
film, fast becoming a kind of cult clas-
sic, follows a group of students through
heir last day of high school in the year
1976. Linklater said in a recent High
Times interview, “Pot is coming back
in a real big way, and if you’re going to
make an honest teen movie, you’re
going to see beer drinking and
pot smoking.”

For W&L students, exposure to the

pot culture has not been limited to the
fashions and ﬁlms of the day. Many
parties are hosts to “clam-bakes” and
“smoke—ups.” Bonﬁrcs burn more than
wood, and bowls hold more than ce-
real. The apparatus of the habit are
complex, ranging from the classic corn
cob pipe to the extraordinarily large
Gremlin-shaped creations named such
things as “Billy.”

While the possession, sale of and
use of marijuana is illegal, many stu-
dents do not consider it to be any more
dangerous than the alcohol so readily
available to them.

“It’s not addictive and it doesn’t
leave me with a hangover,” said
one student.

Many students said they use mari-
juana to relax. “Your eyes get a little
red, like you’ve been crying. That’s
all,” said another student.

The availability of marijuana is
complemented by a historical passive
acceptance of its use. In fact, hemp
was grown by many prosperous colo-
nial planters, including
George Washington.

Betsy Ross sewed the ﬁrst Stars and
Stripes out of hempen cloth and the
ﬁrst several drafts of the Declaration of
Independence were penned on hemp

paper.

Nathan McCall: Testimony of an ex-felon

By MICHAEL HEWLETI‘
Phi Staff Writer

In the midst of the debate over Vir-
ginia Governor Allen’s plan to abolish
parole, Nathan McCall offers a trium-
phant testimony of a ex-felon who went
from serving three years in prison to
becoming a staff reporter for the Wash-
ington Post. McCall ’s book, MakesM e
Wanna Holler.‘ A Young Black Male in

America, traces his life in Cavalier
Manor, a black working-class neigh-
borhood in Norfolk, Virginia.

The story begins in the 1960’s in the
background of the Civil Rights Move-
ment. Everybody wanted a rep and
would do anything to get one. McCall
even ﬁghts his best friend, Shane, to
prove to himself and others just how
crazy he is. McCall hopes that his
mother would stop the ﬁght but knew
he would have to ﬁght if she didn’t.
Luckily, she told them to quit ﬁghting.
“I was so relieved I could have kissed
her on the spot. But there was an audi-
ence out there. I had an image to
project and a role to play. So I acted
disappointed, like I was pissed off that
my mother kept me from tearing off
that nigger’s head.”

“They’ll kill a nigger for dissin’
them. Won’t touch a white person, but
they’ll kill a brother in a heartbeat over

a perceived slight. The irony was that
white folks constantly disrespected us
in ways seen and unseen, and we toler-
ated it....It was as if black folks were
saying, ‘I can ’t do much to keep whites
from dissin’ me, but I damn sure can
keep black folks from doing it.”

This need for respect leads to more
dangerous and disturbing escapades,
including training girls. A train was
essentially a gang rape. A guy would
force a girl to have sex with a number
of guys. As disgusting as this is, McCall
feels compelled to participate so as not
to be singled out as a punk. In a per-
verted sense, a particular train on a girl
named Vanessa marks a turning point;
it creates a bond between McCall and
his friends. It was a macho thing to use
“a member of the most vulnerable
groups of human beings on the face of
the earth—black females.” I ﬁnd this
same type of mentality in some male
rappers’ incessant use of the word,
bitch, to describe women. A train rep-
resented power over women. McCall
soon ﬁnds the same power in some-
thing else: a gun.

Superﬂy, the 1972 movie, glamor-
ized life of drug dealing. To McCall, it
symbolized the essence of cool. Power,
reputation, coolness——all of these things
led McCall to riskier crimes such as
breaking and entering, drug dealing,
mugging, and attempted murder. Fi-
nally, McCall was caught robbing a
McDonalds restaurant and served

three years.

When he gets into prison, he begins
to turn his life around. .He befriends
mentors who teach him about life, his-
tory, philosophy. He vows to make
something out of himself. Just like
Malcolm X, he reads voraciously and
upon his release from prison, he enrolls
at Norfolk State University. Majoring
in journalism, he graduates with hon-
ors and precedes to ﬁnd work.

When he enters the “white estab-
lishment”, he experiences culture
shock. He ﬁnds himself feeling like an
outsider who is under greater scrutiny
than his white counterparts. He must
contend with his co-workers miscon-
ceptions or simple ignorance of black
culture.

McCall has written a truly inspira-
tional and oftentimes biting book. His
honesty makes the story compelling
and persuasive.

He writes as if he is drinking a cup
of coffee and engaging you in conver-
sation. You get to know him, some-
times too well. At points you might not
approve of his actions, but you could
appreciate his experience. He has an
original voice, one mixed with self-
righteous anger and humor. He offers
an challenging and brutal perspective
on black male-female relationship,
crime, race, and the competitive world
of journalism. It moves one from laugh-
ter to anger to sadness. One thing is
sure: it made me wanna holler.

to W&L’s vast array of activities.

Late night at Lee—Hi

By SASHA HARTMAN AND LINDSAY

WILLS
Phi Staff Writers

Lee-Hi truck stop, one of
Rockbridge County ’s ﬁnest dining es-
tablishments, offers more than just food
to its customers. Located off Route 1 1,
Lee-Hi provideswashingfacilities, fuel
and entertainment.

For those travelers who are also
avid shoppers, it provides a wide as-
sortment of clothes, decaled cups and
classes and the ever important gear
shift cozies. For W&L students and
Lexington residents, it serves as a late
night hangout on weekends.

Although W&L students typically
do not frequent the establishment dur-
ing the week, but rather on Saturday
nights, one waitress said that “there

;till are noticeable regulars.” When

asked whether the students were gen-
erally well behaved or not, she insisted
that the majority of the students were
“passive and caused no problems.”
However, she went on to mention that
there are exceptions when the students
had “partied too much.”

In addition to W&L students, many
truck drives frequent Lee-Hi. The
waitress reported that the truckers en-
joy the mixed company of the students
but are hindered by their presence when
they were in a hurry and needed fast
service.

In order to facilitate all of its cus-
tomers, Lee-Hi has had to expand in
size over the years. Originally, the fuel
desk was located where the juke box
now stands. There was no store and the
dining area was contained in the front
seating area.

With such a large variety of meals
to choose from it is hard to know what
to order. Popular favorites include the

He-Man special, scrambled eggs, grits

with cheese and hotcakes. Often the
food is eaten with such haste—scarfed
— that it is hard to discern what the
students actually ordered without ex-
amining the bills. Are these cases of
the munchies?

Besides delicious food, friendly ser-
vice and “unique” merchandise, Lee-
Hi offers the sheltered W&L student
fascinating encounters with those not
typically found at fraternity parties.
Although many ﬁnd entertainment in
the pinball and video machine games,
the juke box offers plenty of enjoy-
ment, with a “wide” selection of music
ranging from Johnnie Cash to Willie
Nelson.

A trip to Lee-Hi is a mutually re-
warding experience. Not only do W&L
students take pleasure in observing the
regulars at Lee-Hi, the regulars at Lee-
Hi are also equally entertained but the
duckheaded, ﬂanneled student. To have
fully participated in the W&L experi-
ence, late night at Lee-Hi is a must!

Hyams is wise enough to let Van Damme’s incredible

What it boils down to is that this is not a particularly
good ﬁlm: the acting is atrocious, the special effects grow ,

The policy was formally approved last
year and again this year.

Webb said the policy prevents the
EC from favoring one group over an-
other. It made sense to keep the EC as
neutral as possible.

Schneider said he sees the EC as
being quite political as well. He said
the EC president announced his sup-
port for the death penalty before Am-
nesty International presented its bud-
get last year. Amnesty lntemational
was denied funding last year because
the EC deemed them ideologically par-
tisan.

Webb said he does not recall stating
his opinion on the death penalty before
Amnesty International presented their
budget.

“If you look at theirbudget, pushing
a certain ideology is their main pur-
pose,” he said. “I support their actions.
However, I think the organization falls
into organizations we do not fund.”

Webb said the parody was not of-
fensive.

“We took it in the humor it was
intended,” he said.

VMI appeal
still in progress

By COURTNEY MILLER
Phi Staff Writer

For decades, Virginia Military In-
stitute has trained young men to ﬁght,
lead and win on the battleﬁeld as well
as off.

Ironically, since 1990 VMI has been
engaged in a war of its own. One not of
guns and bullets, but of words and
interpretations.

The fourteenth amendment of the
United States Constitution guarantees
equal education regardless of race, color
or sex. In 1990 the Justice Department
sued VMI for violation of the Constitu-
tion on behalf of an unnamed
Virginia woman.

VMI faces the opposition on Sept.
28 and begin what many hope will be
the last battle of a war that has gone on
far too long. Oral arguments for both
sides will be heard by the Fourth Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals.

Mike Strickler, Public Relations
Director for VMI explained
the situation.

“Each side is limited to 30 minutes
of oral appeal to the judge. Each side
will have an opportunity to present

arguments and defend their stance,”
Stricklersaid. “Although there is no set
date for a ﬁnal decision, we have asked
for expedition in this case so that plans
for the Mary Baldwin program can go
forth [unhindered].”

In May of 1994, VMI was given
three options when they appealed a
decision to admit women to VMI, one
of which was to establish a similar
program for women. VMI has been
working to open just such a program at
all the female Mary Baldwin College.

Colonel Michael Bissell, former
Commandante of Cadets, will act as a
liaison between the two colleges, coor-
dinating the ROTC program, and an-
swering questions that will arise, ac-
cording to Strickler.

The leadership program is currently
slated to open in the fall of 1995-96.
The legality of such a program is still
in question.

According to Ellen J. Vargyas, se-
nior counsel for the National Women’s
Law center, providing a “separate
but equal” program for women
is impossible. The value of a school
such as VMI lies not in the program
itself, but the history, prestige, alumni
and endowments of the institution.

For once, a cut in

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
-Founded September 18, 1897

Self—cong'ratulation is in order

Washington and Lee jumped up the US News & World
Report ratings this week as the elite university world watched
with bated breath, proving what we have hoped: W&L gives
one of the country’s finest educations and is improving every
year.

In what is arguably the most important category from a
purely educational standpoint, that of faculty resources, W&L
was an unprecedented number one. This and academic repu-
tation may be the best indicators of pure educational ability.

Though we rank only 24th in academic reputation (mea-
sured by compiling the opinions of the administrators of
colleges throughout the country), a number one in faculty
resources seems to clinch a place in the very upper echelon of
the higher education world.

Part of the reason that we still fall behind schools in the top
10 is that our tuition is so comparatively low, and that is a part
of the ratio used to determine financial resources per student.
Another statistic that hurts us is the graduation rate; the
number is determined as an average of the freshmen enrolled
from 1984 to 1987 who graduated within six years.

Because W&L’s selectivity and student characteristics
began improving after coeducation in 1986, this area does not
accurately reﬂect the current student retention rate (though
admittedly, it would be difficult to obtain any more update
statistics due to the nature of the six-year qualification).

So, W&L, feel secure that you are really much cooler than
they make you out to be —- and we just jumped an amazing ﬁve
places on the ratings scale. We would bet that this is only the
beginning....the question is, how can we break into the ranks
of Amherst and Williams? What does it take?

Hopefully, the question will be answered soon. It may seem
like we are concentrating too much on surface characteristics,
but this is really one of the most important aspects of any
school, because the school’s name recognition in the eyes of
potential employers can be the difference between a good job
and a great job, and that is the bottom line.

Thanks, Molly

It is almost time for the traditional “Why don’t the under-
classmen keep up the speaking tradition” debate, but I would
like to provide a new twist.
Early this week, I boarded the elevator on the fourth ﬂoor.
A freshman boarded on the third ﬂoor and, immediately
throwing me off guard, looked at me.
I know it is tradition, even at this great “speaking tradition
of Robert E. Lee” school, to keep to oneself in elevators unless
the other riders are intimate acquaintances.
But this freshmen gave me a friendly “Hello” and intro-
;duced herself.

This was so surprising that I think I scared her a little when
I affirmed her comment that the only people who go around

introducing themselves were freshmen.

, But, Molly, I would like to let you know that you opened my
_:'eyes to the hypocrisy of people who argue about freshmen

How to build the better kitchen

DREAM LAND
Richard Weaver

There comes a time in every
student’s life when he or she must defy
Dean Manning and move out of uni-
versity-owned housing. I decided to
“make the break” this year and get an

. apartment in town with Phi Movie

Reviewer Kirk Susong.

I found out that getting an apart-
ment entails obtaining furnishings and
essentials to ﬁllother rooms you haven’t
been used to having, like a living room
and an area I’ve been told is called a
“kitchen,” which is used for some sort
of voodoo practice called “cooking.”
This “kitchen” looked like it would
require many items, an opportunity for
me to see how resourceful (and tacky)
I could be. Luckily, I was ready for the
challenge; in my ﬁrst two years of
college I had gotten lots of practice
with a technique I call “mining.”

Mining begins freshman year with
your high school yearbook. It sits
among stuff that is unused at your
house and you ﬁgure you could prob-
ably beneﬁt from having something to
read when you’re bored (besides your
Chemistry textbook), so you “mine” it
and bring it up to Lexington. The next
stage is when you go home for Thanks-
giving and you decide you simply must
bring up some of your old tapes (in-
cludingNationalAnthems of the World
and Chaka Khan’s I Feel For You).

Well then, Christmas rolls around
and you ﬁgure you had better bring
some old T-shirts up so you can “layer
up” and beat the winter cold. February
break comes and you have to “mine”
all of your Dad’s ski equipment and
pretty soon you have brought up your
entire collection of 1984 NFL trading
cards, your collection of Transformers
(Autobots and Decepticons), and an
anthology of your elementary school
love notes to Jennifer Lier.

Getting back
to my original

dollar. Actually, everything in the store
is $1.06 with sales tax, so perhaps a
more accurate name would be Dollar

Tree Surrounded By Six Saplings.
With my brother Elwood I entered
the store wearing dark sunglasses,
greeted the cashier, and told her I was
on a mission from God. Then I asked
her what the most popular item in Dol-
lar Tree was, and she pointed to the
racks of angel and animal ﬁgurines at
the front of the store. These will make
neat stirrers for
my kitchen, I said

stored in an old

Crown Royal box. But this was simply
not enough; thus, I embarked on the
ﬁrst stop of the fall leg of the Dream
Land World Tour.

I arrived at Dollar Tree (next to
Wal-Mart) one afternoon ready for
bargains. Before I go on I should prob-
ably explain the premise behind Dollar
Tree: everything in the store costs one

ger, which could
be incredibly handy if one of your
dinner guests wanted some more spray
cheese and he or she was across the
room from you.

The back wall of Dollar Tree was a
virtual treasure trove. Sequins and
rhinestones were sold by the roll, and
after reading a few chapters inStitch by
Stitch.‘ A Home Library of Sewing,

Knitting, Crochet, and Needlecraft
(which is, coincidentally, also avail-
able at Dollar Tree), we could have
some really ﬂashy pot holders and
dishtowels, huh? Not to mention rhine-
stones could add a nifty “crunch” to
homemade casseroles and desserts.

Food was deﬁnitely a good buy at
Dollar Tree. There was a good selec-
tion of Basted Snackin’ Bones, which
according to the package were 100%
ALL BEEF, natural rawhide, doggie
tested and approved, and Made in Bra-
zil. Basted Snackin’ Bones come
shaped (and colored!) like doughnuts,
cheeseburgers, poached eggs, drum-
sticks, and lollipops.

However, you shouldn’t feel com-
pelled to tell your guests that the dinner
of Basted Snackin’ Bones you served
them was intended for consumption by
dogs. If they get suspicious, just say,
“Hey, man, get serious—would people
really waste perfectly good beef-ﬂa-
vored lollipops on their dogs?”

This would probably be a good time
to mention that Dollar Tree also sells
surgical masks for one ’s guests to wear
should Betsy Green drop by unexpect-
edly around dinnertime. You just don’t
know where she’s been.

I left Dollar Tree with several bags
that day. Although I still don’t have
everything I need for a kitchen (a re-
cent quote from a friend: “What do you
mean, you don’t have any salt or pep-
per?”), I feel I’ve got a good start. I’ve
become part of the tree of life here in
Lexington: the Dollar Tree.

Toles contests Phi EC, SBA coverage

To the editor:

I am writing in regard to Sarah Gilbert’s article
concerning the EC Budget deliberations. I was ap-
palled to see the way in which my quote was taken out
of context. Having been a journalism major at Wash-
ington and Lee, I learned the importance of joumalis-
tic integrity and honesty. Obviously this has not been
a part of Ms. Gilbert’s W&L curriculum.

What upsets me the most about Ms. Gilbert’s
article is not the falsehood with which the SAB and

Gilbert’s article leaves the W&L community with the
impression that a confrontational debate occurred
between the SBA and the EC. This was not the case.

As a member of the EC that was elected by the law
and undergraduate students of W&L, my goal has
been to try to bridge the gap between both sides. This
is what the members of the EC as well as the SBA are
striving for this year. It is unfortunate that when so
many people are working so hard to achieve a com-
mon goal, one person can try to spoil it for a lead story.

KA are left, but the division it attempts to create. The
members of the EC and the Student Bar Association

worked hard to understand the opinions of one an-
other during budget deliberations. In the end both
sides were happy with what they accomplished. Ms.

Sincerely,
William M. Toles ‘95L

  Fulbright

Seniors interested in applying
for Fulbright Fellowships for 1995-
96 should contact Professor Herrick
immediately in his ofﬁce in the
Commerce School, Room 212, to
learn about procedures and sched-
uling. The fellowships pay for a
year of study abroad.

If you lost a Schwinn bicycle
recently or if you suspect it was
stolen, please call the Lexington
Police at 463-2112 to identify.

Seniors interested in Rhodes
scholarships should contact Pro-
fessor Evans immediately.

Outing Club

There will be a Outing Club
meeting on Wednesday, Sept. 29 at
7 p.m. at the Outing Club house.
Everyone is welcome.

Editor’s Note: I regret that William Toles took
his comment as seriously as he did. I meant it to
reﬂect the friendly repartee among the Executive
Committee members during their long hours of
deliberations, thinking that no one could possibly
take the comment as a serious slam

I would like to add, however, that the discussion
about the SBA was confrontational at times, and I
presented the situation exactly as it took place. It
was reported similarly in other campus publica-

tions. There is no bigger supporter of law school-
undergraduate relations than me, and I would
suggest that Toles speak with his peers ifhe does not
recognize this.

out in the form of Confederate Flags. We will have lighter ﬂuid available if they wish to burn their ﬂag—bids, too.

Women’s cross country breaks into top 25

By KEITH GRANT
Phi Staff Writer

Following the lead of Wash-
ington & Lee’s women’s lacrosse
and tennis programs, W&L’s lady
runners are drawing national at-
tention.

Just don’t expect to see them
following much else. They’re
quite comfortable leading by
themselves.

Two weeks and a pair of first-
place finishes into the ’94 sea-
son, the women’s cross-country
team has cracked the national
rankings for the first time ever at
number 25.

The team will face a big test
Saturday when they face a num-
ber of Division I programs at the
VMI Invitational. Among the
teams expected to compete are
Virginia, Virginia Tech, Radford,
and Liberty.

Head coach Jim Phemister,
though, likes what he sees from
his team heading into the meet.

“They have no apprehension
about Saturday,” he said.
“They’re just really doing a su-
per job.”

The meet is scheduled to start
at 8:45 am at the Rockbridge

County High School. Despite the
challenge facing them Saturday,
the women are already optimis-
tic about the season ahead.

“This is our best season yet,”
said senior captain Kim Herring.

The Generals let that be known
by taking the top spot in the 24-
team Lebanon Valley Invitational
two weeks ago. W&L finished
fifth in that meet last year.

Last Saturday, the women
turned their home debut into a
whipping of Mary Washington
College. Junior Josephine
Schaeffer cruised across the fin-
ish line in 18:15, a second off her
own course record.

Junior Amy Mears was next
across a minute and a half later,
and senior Sue Deutsch placed
fourth (21:01).

At Lebanon Valley, Schaeffer
(18:23) won in a laugher, taking
38 seconds off her own course
record, set last year.

A third place finish by Mears
and aﬁfth place showing by fresh-
man Maren Wright helped the
Generals dominate the 24-team
field.

Another freshman, Carson
Flowers, finished in eleventh. She
and her classmates have given
the already talented Generals rea-

son to call this their “best season
yet.”
“They really add to our depth,”
said Herring, a 15th place fin-
isher at Lebanon Valley. “We
need to have seven or eight strong
runners, and they’ve ﬁt right in.”

Schaeffer is also excited about
what the first-year runners have
brought to the squad.

“They’re great,” she said. “It’s
a big transition from high school
and they’ve done so well.”

According to Herring, the
newcomers and the entire team’s
improvement have given the
women reason for optimism.
After a second place ﬁnish at last
year’s regional championships,
a ﬁrst place performance and a
berth to the national champion-
ships appears within the team’s
grasp.

“I thinkwe have a good chance
as a team,” Schaeffer said. “That
would really be fun.”

For Schaeffer, a trip to na-
tionals would be a great accom-
plishment. Not because it would
be her third straight chance at the
national title, but that just a few
months ago she wasn’t running
at all.

A knee injury wiped out her
spring track season and left her

wondering about her running fu-
ture. After a ﬁve months of inac-
tivity, she was able to work her
way back.

“I didn’t really know what to
think,” Schaeffer said of her run-
ning career. “I worked really hard,
though, and I’m just happy to be
running again. It’s nice to be
back.”

For someone in a sport of few
breaks, Schaeffer was frustrated
by being unable to train, yet knew
that she probably needed a rest.

After a summer of hard work
to get back in form, the two-time
All-American appears to be as
good as ever. Along the way back,
she also picked up a new out-
look.

“My attitude towards running
has changed so much,” she said.
“I appreciate it so much more.”

She also would likely appre-
ciate a first place finish by her
team at the NCAA South/South-
east Regionals, sending the en-
tire squad to the nationals.

This year’s regional champi-
onship is scheduled for
Schaeffer’s hometown of Mem-
phrs.

“If the team stays healthy and
works hard, we can do it,” she
said.

W&L Volleyball rolls on

BY STEPHEN WILLIARD
Phi Sports Editor

Pitt-Johnstown proved to be
the bane of the Generals at the
Washington and Lee Invitational
last weekend.

The Generals lost to Pitt-
Johnstown in the ﬂrst and last
games of the tournament as they
tallied a second place finish with
a 4-2 record.

Washington and Lee was rep-
resented on the All-Tournament
team by freshman Hilary Martin
who netted 56 kills in six matches.

Following the match against
Pitt-Johnstown in the first con-
test of the Invitational, starting
setter Cheryl Taurassi was in-
jured in the second match against
Elizabethtown.

The injury just provided an
opportunity for a W&L player to
step up and perform. Freshman
Allison Beard came on to help
the Generals to a 15-12 victory.

To reach the finals, the W&L
squad had to find a way to defeat
Sweet Briar, Thiel, and Catholic
in three straight games.

While the task facing the Gen-
erals was by no means a simple
one, the team responded with
ﬂair.

Against Sweet Briar and
Thiel, the Generals were victori-
ous in straight games, leaving
only Catholic standing between
the W&L team and a rematch
with Pitt-Johnstown.

After winning the first game
15-7, the Generals lost the sec-
ond game 15-8 and trailed 6-1 in
the third game. Once again, a
W&L player stepped forward.

This time it was senior Jen-
nifer Garrigus. The W&L cap-
tain turned it on with seven kills
in the third game to rally the
team to a 15-8 win and a chance
at the championship.

Despite the tightly contested
loss in the championship match,
the Generals had reached the
championship match for the first
time in the four year history of
the tournament.

The other contest for the Gen-
erals this week was against Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
rival Eastern Menonite Thurs-
day night.

The Generals fell 2-1 in the
contest, but not without outstand-
ing individual efforts.

Sophomore Elizabeth Bahn
and Hilary Martin led the team in
kills with seven apiece.

Cheryl Taurassi was back on
the ﬂoor with 20 assists for the
Generals as they played a tough,
in-conference rival.

The W&L team has opened
the season on a high note with a
5-4 record as they try to improve
on the 15-12 mark of last season.

Last year was the first for
coach Terry Dadio, and the first
winning season for the Generals
since 1988.

On the slate this week for the
team are conference rivals
Roanoke and Randolph Macon
Women’s College.

The Generals defeated both
teams last season 3-0. The next
weekend finds the team at the
Emory Invitational.

The Generals are shooting for
the first back to back winning
seasons in the team’s history.
They also have a chance at the
school record for wins, which
currently stands at 16.

Athletes of the Week

BY STEPHEN WILLIARD
Phi Sports Editor

Being a freshman starter on a
college sports team is difficult
enough, but to come in and per-
form at a high level is quite rare.

Freshman soccer center for-
ward Erica Reineke has done just
that. The freshman star has al-
ready tied last seasons team high
with 13 points on 5 goals and 3
assists. ,

In the loss to Virginia
Wesleyan, Reineke had both
W&L goals in the 3-2 contest
and against Randolph Macon she
tallied a goal and an assist.

Reineke, though only a fresh-

man, has a legitimate shot at the
school scoring record.

The current school record
stands at 21 points for the sea-
son.
Soccer provided both athletes
of the week this week as men’s
soccer star Shag Drewry claimed
the honor.

The junior led the team in
scoring last season with seven
goals and an assist, but was shut
down early in the year by oppos-
ing defenses.

Recently, Drewry has come
off the bench to provide a much
needed spark for the Generals
offense.

Drewry scored two goals in a
come-from-behind win over

Emory and Henry.

He also netted a crucial insur-
ance goal against Frostburg State
in W&L’s 2-0 victory.

The three goals in two games
put Drewry back atop the W&L
soccer scoring list again this sea-
son.
Both athletes have made sig-
niﬁcant contributions to their re-
spective teams over the course of
the past week. Both soccer squads
have benefited from the presence
of these offensive threats.

--Athletes of‘ the week are se-
lected each week by the Wash-

ment.

Tear night: Washington and
Lee’s biggest night of debauch-
ery is ﬁnally over.

Unfortunately, some did not
make it through unscathed. The
inﬁrmary reported that although
the alcohol related incidents they
see now are not as bad as
they used to be, the number
is increasing.

Over the weekend they treated
approximately twelve students
who were either there because of
alcohol induced states or from
injuries received while drinking.
Only one student had to be taken
to the hospital. Four students went
directly to the emergency room
instead of going to the
infirmary ﬁrst.

On the legal front, Washing-
ton and Lee Security reported that
23 students were arrested over the
weekend by the seven Lexington
Police Department officers and
eight Alcohol Beverage Control
officers on duty.

These arrests ranged from be-
ing drunk in public to noise viola-
tions to urinating in public.

ABC agents also seized 13
cases of beer purchased for a mi-
nor by a 21 year-old student. The
minor received a minor in posses-

sion and the 21 year-old received
a contributing to the delinquency
of a minor.

Mike Young, Director of
W&L Security, says that there
seems to have been more alco-
hol consumed this year, but the
level of arrests remained the
same as in previous years.

“We shouldn’t have anybody
arrested over this weekend, but
it still happens every year,” says
Young.

How was tear night for the
students? Most freshmen had
expected it to be a lot wilder
than it actually was. Scott Wein
said that it wasn’t as bad as he
had thought it would be. Ac-
cording to him, most of his
pledge class just got drunk early
and passed out.

Todd Ellingson seemed to
agree with this statement, but
called it the “best time he
couldn’t remember having.”
Matt O’Brien said that it was a
“wonderfulconclusiontoaweek
of worry and anticipation” where
he “spilled his guts to his broth-
ers — literally.”

Gordon Meeker told a story
many people can relate to about
his friend getting arrested. Ap-
parently his friend was drunk in
public. The next morning when
he was picked up from the po-
lice station, his friend “thought

it was really cool that he had
been arrested.”

Aside from the drunken
events, most freshmen agreed that
the brothers were rather nice dur-
ing tear night.

One freshman reports that the
brothers repeatedly told them that

‘it was their night and they should
enjoy themselves. Another fresh-
man said, “The brothers were
really cool; they didn’t force us
to do anything we didn’t want
to do.”

Now that tear night is over,
how do people feel about this
year’s Rush calendar? Dean Man-
ning feels that this year’s Rush
was more competitive and selec-
tive. Typically, approximately

_90% of the freshman males enter
Rush. This year there were 258
men in the class with 248 men
entering Rush. Thirty three fresh-
man who rushed did not tear at
any house.

Manning says that he has
heard favorable comments about
the shortened Rush.

He also commends Kevin
Batteh, president of the IFC, for
managing Rush and taking time
to help individual freshmen with
their problems concerning the
entire Rush process.

The ﬁrst U.S. soldier to die in Haiti was killed apparently by his own

College tuition is growing faster than the inﬂation rate according to

Edward Cleary speaks on campus)

about freedom of expression

By ETHAN KRUPP
Phi News Editor

The lawyer who successfully de-
fended a cross burner visited campus
this past Monday.

Edward Cleary, the St. Paul, Min-
nesota Public Defender who defended
the juvenile Robert A. Victoria in the
R.A.V. case before the Supreme Court
spoke at the Law School in the Moot
Courtroom ‘on September 26. The
R.A.V. case involved a minor who had
placed a burning cross on the front
lawn ofa black couple who had moved
into a all white suburb. Instead of being
charged under trespassing, vandalism,
and terrorist threat laws, he was charged
under the Bias Disorderly Conduct
Ordinance, passed in 1982. This law
prohibited any kind of speech or action
that “upset, angered, or irritated” any-
one. This was, in Cleary’s mind, a clear
violation of the First Amendment. He
decided to ﬁght for the overturning of
the law. He succeeded in January, 1992.

Cleary did want to make it clear that
he thought the action his client com-
mitted was “heinous.” He was also
frustrated that the prosecutor “decided
to make a political statement” by using
the hate speech law rather than slap-
ping Victoria with a felony prosecu-

said that we must protect the fringes of
free speech in order to protect the core
of it. This means protecting such ac-
tivities as the burning of a cross or an
American ﬂag, as offensive as we may
find them, according to Cleary.

“I feel that the Court was well ahead
of many legal scholars,” when they
overturned the speech code, said Cleary.
He said the censorship of one topic can
become enforced silence and it must be
stopped before it happens.

Cleary said, “racism and
homophobia are wrong but the
govemment’s role in changing those
views is limited.” Cleary would have
the people change these viewpoints
through education and understanding,
as long as the ability to express these
views is not limited.

Cleary was randomly assigned the
case one morning while doing cases for
indigent youth. “There are those who
feel I should have slept in,” he said.

Cleary, who recently published Be-

the case, felt that the case was essen-
tially “political correctness on trial.”
He said the case was especially impor-
tant because it headed off a trend of

speech codes spreading across the coun-
try. The Supreme Court must have also
felt something needed to be done about
speech codes because of the 91 cases

Court at the time, the Justices took only
the R.A.V. case, according to Cleary.

By CINDY YOUNG
Phi Staff Writer

Members of the lnterfratemity Council met on
Tuesday to discuss Homecoming ’94 and
other topics.

With the arrival of Homecoming this weekend,
IFC President Kevin Batteh reviewed fraternity guide-
lines for a responsible weekend. Representatives of
the thirteen fraternities present were reminded to
pick up permits for their respective parties at the
Lexington Police Station, and to registertheir parties
at the Dean of Students’ ofﬁce.

In addition, each fraternity is expected to follow
such practices as providing a guest list, designating
a sober ofﬁcer, and offering alternative beverages
for those not drinking alcohol this weekend.

Batteh further cautioned brothers to “keep an
eye” out for excessive drinking on the part of both
fraternity pledges and alumni caught in the excite-
ment ofliomecoming and eager to create new memo-
ries or recapture old ones.

On another note, Habitat for Humanity co—founder
Jackie VanVliet addressed the fraternity representa-
tives about the organization’s goal for each graduat-
ing class to build a house for a needy family in
Lexington. Halfway to their goal for this year, they
still need $5000 and any fraternity contributions
could make a crucial difference. Batteh encourages
all houses to participate in this project.

Dean of Students David Howison expressed his

desire for the IFC members turn their attentions to
“the freshman who wanted bids” but due to a variety
of reasons did not receive one. He encouraged any
fraternity interested in expanding its pledge class to
work with him. To this end, a list of those men who
participated in Rush, but did not receive a bid is
currently being prepared.

Finally, a Coca-Cola representative offered the
company’s services in bringing Coke products to the
fraternity houses. Pepsi is currently the only soda
available at W&L facilities. Plans are already under-
way, however, to replace Pepsi with a Coke fountain
at the Sigma Chi house.

CRC report
with Wilson

By EMILY BAKER
Phi Staff Writer

The long awaited results of the Coeducation Re-
view Committee’s report are almost ready for public
disclosure.

The committee put the results of its year-long
study into President John Wilson’s hands last Friday.
It will be available to the public after Wilson reads it
and decides how best to present it to the community.

“We asked that he make it available to the com-
munity by putting a copy of it on reserve in the
library,” said committee co-chair Pamela Simpson,
Professor of Art History. “But it’s his prerogative
how he goes about doing it.”

Wilson commissioned the group of both students
and faculty “to look at the university and its opera-

tions and determine how coeducation had changed
us,” said Simpson.

“When we first looked at this thing, we were
absolutely overwhelmed,” she said. But much like a
student at the beginning of a new term, she added,
“We saw we had to take it one step at a time and break
it down into different tasks.”

Thus the study was divided into categories of
admissions, academics, athletics, student life (which
was subdivided into smaller categories of housing,
security, social life, and political life), faculty and
administration, and community opportunities.

The committee met with different departments
and student groups, such as Admissions, the Minority
Students Association, the Executive Committee, and
the Women’s Forum. The committee also solicited
results from the student body, but was disappointed
with the number of responses, Simpson said.

After all the research was completed, it was com-
piled into a 196 page report.

Though not yet at liberty to disclose the results,
Simpson did report that “we conﬁrmed that coeduca-
tion has improved the university, and we identiﬁed
some problem areas. We hope that one of the results
of this study is that these problem areas will be dealt
with.”

Courtney Love rocks Crossroads C

By ETHAN KRUPP
Phi News Editor

Courtney Love and her band Hole whipped
re crowd into a frenzy on Tuesday at their
row at the Crossroads Concert Hall.

Hole play at the club formerly known as
rax as part of their East coast tour. Two of my
atemity brothers and I decided to go to the
row at 2 p.m. Tuesday afternoon. We got a late
zart because one of our group had to attend the
ring quartet concert at the Lenfest Center for
music class. We hit the road around 10 p.m. in
n old RX-7 with no back seat. That meant one
f us had to lie in the hatch. I now know how
ncomfortable riding in the hatch of a RX-7 can
e.

Upon arriving in Charlottesville, we
Ianaged to get lost. All this time, we kept
raying that we would not miss any of Hole’s
:t. We ﬁnally got directions from some guys in

low rider at McDonald’s and made it to
Yrossroads. As we walked inside we were met
'ith Nine Inch Nails’ Downward Spiral album.
ortunately, Hole had not started yet. We did,
owever, miss the opening act, Madder Rose.

As we mingled in the back of the club, we
iscussed the chance of Hole covering some
Iirvana songs. It seemed possible. The stage
>oked like a typical moderate budget punk
rage: big amps and a decent sized drum kit. On
)p of the amps were a bunch of plastic dolls
nd other stuffed animals. We guessed that
fourtney had something twisted planned for
re toys.

The Color ofNight — {kt} 1/2

The Color of Night was a refreshing sur-
prise, which, though heavy on the psycho-
analysis, creates moods and atmospheres with
relish.

Willis plays Dr. Bill Capa, a successful New
York psychologist. However, after he tosses
off a harsh comment, a suicidal patient jumps
out his ofﬁce window in front of his eyes. He is
extremely traumatized (the sight of her blood
makes him color-blind to red), so he quits his
job and goes to Los Angeles to visit an old
college buddy.

Scott Bakula portrays that friend and fellow
psychologist, Dr. Bob Moore. But things are
not so rosy at Bob’s practice either.

Dr. Moore holds sessions of group therapy
for ﬁve wackos: Sandra, a nymphomaniac and
a kleptomaniac all in one; Buck, whose wife
and daughter died violently; Casey, a snide

' molested artist; Richie, a violent, stuttering boy

who wishes he were a girl; and a buttoned-
down lawyer who’s an obsessive compulsive
about cleanliness and order.

One of these ﬁve is making death threats

Hole took the stage. Love set the tone for the
night when she grabbed the microphone and
said, “Good evening. We’re Flock of Seagulls.”
Hole then released a barrage of noise. We could
not recognize the ﬁrst song, but the second one
was “Beautiful Son” from the DGC Rarities,
Volume 1 album. The lyrics of this song show
why Hole is not a widely popular band on
campus:

You look good in my dress.

Get your friends to clean the mess.

You look good in my clothes.

...My beautiful son.

For those unfamiliar with Hole’s music, the
majority of it tends to have a very fast chorus
with a slower verse. This lent itself well to the
crowd’s desire to mosh. My only problem with
the mosh pit was that it was not really a mosh
pit. Instead, it was a lot of people bouncing up
and down and pushing forward towards the
stage. I was able to move within ﬁve feet of the
stage by pressing through the people standing
in the back and shoving my way through the
bouncing throngs.

Most of the songs were from Live Through
This, Hole’s new album, and tended to be fairly
true to the studio versions. The band ripped
through incredible versions of “Violet” and
“Rock Star.” They also performed a poignant
version of “Miss World.” During “Asking For
It,” Love seemed ready to explode with anger.
Love’s strong feelings on women’s rights were
very evident during “Asking For It,” a song that
deals with rape. Her lyrics tore apart the typical
male defense that “she was asking for it:”

Was she asking for it?

Was she asking nice?

Did she ask you for it?

Did she ask you twice?

Several other songs did not sound familiar at

all and may have been from
Hole’s ﬁrst album. The last
song of the set was a new
song which had a lot to do
with death and loneliness. We
assumed that itwas written
sometime after Love’s hus-
band, Kurt Cobain of N irvana,
killed himself last April. Love
also made reference to Cobain
when she put on a ﬂannel
shirt that had been thrown onto
the stage. She said, “Grunge
is dead. I killed it and now I
have a little black hole in my
heart for it.” She then played
one song, took the shirt off,
and threw it to the ground.
Several times throughout
the show, either Love or the
new bassist identiﬁed only as
“Michelle from Quebec” who
replaced Kristen Pfaff, Hole’s
original bassist who over-

 

oncert Hall

 

dosed on drugs, grabbed a doll
and threw them to the audience.

The dolls were immediately torn to pieces.
Two guys standing right in front of me had the
head of one, but could not agree on who should
get it.

They asked me to flip a coin for them in the
midst of the mosh pit to determine who would
keep the head. I did, and the loser relinquished
the head to the winner. They then went their
separate ways. It was amazing to see such
understanding the middle of all that mosh pit
aggression.

Love also displayed a razor wit when one
male memberof thecrowd criedout, “Courtney,
give me head.” She turned to the crowd and

explained her sexually frustration was evident
in the one cigarette per song she was smoking.
She then said, “So I’ve decided to get it all out
right now, and you are the lucky guy. Yeah,
right!”

As part of the encore, Hole played one verse
of Duran Duran’s “Hungry Like A Wolf.” After
the ﬁrst verse, Love said, “We played that too
well.” A pumped up, fast version of “Plump”
from Live Through This, wrapped up the en-
core. Then they turned on the overhead lights
and it was over.

The energy and intensity of the show made
it well worth the $11.50 ticket price. Besides,
Hole is just a cool band.

As you might guess, this mystery woman be-

comes the linchpin to the movie’s very sketchy
lot.

P There are two big flaws in this movie. One
is the absurd sexual content. Apparently Holly-
wood has gotten the idea that sex will necessar-
ily contribute to a ﬁlm, thanks, no doubt, to
successful ﬁlms which used sex as a focal
point, like Basic Instinct, 9 I /2 Weeks or even
Like Water for Chocolate.

Unfortunately, in most films, poorly done,

lessen the psycho-
logical intensity and
dramatic tension which the rest of the movie
works so hard to establish.

The other great ﬂaw in the movie is the very
sketchy plot. When the movie is over, it is clear
what happened, but we are not at all sure why.
What would make someone act like the charac-
ters do in this ﬁlm? Although the dialogue is
good, the notions underlying the script are
shaky.

One reason for this is that the whole ﬁlm

Love defined:
Ackerman

tells all

By MICHAEL HEWLETT
Phi Staff Writer

Romeo and Juliet. Aeneas and Dido.
Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. What
do they have in common? They’ve all been
touched by the magical, irresistible, insa-
tiable potion of love. Love makes men fumble
for words and makes women’s hearts ﬂutter
with nervous anticipation. Love provides both
calm and calamity in our lives; yet, we would
not be human without it. Throughout the ages,
man has struggled with this basic question:
What is love? Diane Ackennan provides some
interesting answers in her book, A Natural
History of Love.

Ackerman takes the reader on a wonderful
journey through time and explores different
cultures to better understand the mystery and
the attraction of love. She starts with Cleopatra
( immortalized by Elizabeth Taylor) and her
status as the ultimate love goddess. She
chronicles her love affair with Antony. From
there she explores Egyptian love poems and
how they perceived love in all of their art. She
traces love even in the rampant homosexual-

ity in Ancient Greece and Rome. In these
ancient cultures, love manifested itself in
strange ways. For instance, the penis became
a symbol of love; people often wore phallic
symbols around their necks or surrounded
their houses with them. She shows the reader
the joys and the tragedies of love in the stories
of Romeo and Juliet; Abelard and Heloise;
Aeneas and Dido; and Orpheus and Eurydice.
In each story, love leads to the suicide of the
lovers. Ackerman shows how love causes
both pain and pleasure, both joy and sorrow.

One of the most interesting things I learned
was the idea of courtly love. This occurred in
the medieval ages of Lancelots and damsels in
distress. In this scenario the woman had the
power. The woman would allow the knight to
court her and woo her. The knight could even
look upon her nakedness and even engage in
sexual intercourse. Yet, it was more of a game
where the woman had the upperhand. Usu-
ally, inﬂuential and educated women engaged
in this creative adultery, which is remarkable
considering the anti-woman sentiments cus-
tomary for this period. The theologian Tho-
mas Aquinas considered women “defective
and misbegotten.”

She compares the rampant escapades of
the world’s greatest lovers, Don Juan and
Casanova. Ackerman analyzes Casanova’s
promiscuous behavior as resulting from his
mother’s desertion while Don Juan was sim-
ply a cold—hearted aristocrat. She even dis-
cusses one of our Founding Fathers, Ben-
jamin Franklin who was also quite a woman-
rzer.

She further explores the ideas of Aristotle,
Freud, Jung, and psychologists in order to
ﬁgure out why love is so important to us. Why
do women feel such a connection to horses?
Why do men feel such a attachment to their
cars? What role does hair play in this on-
going struggle with love? Throughout the
book she attempts to answer these questions
and more.

In her exploration of love, Ackennan writes
with deft and clever strokes. She brings a
certain freshness to her writing. Her insights
about love in all of its forms, whether it be
romantic or simply altruistic, ring true. She
struggles with the basic issues that ultimately
make us human. Why is love such a scary
thing? Why is man so cruel? She tackles them
with such keen intelligence and sharp wit that
one is never left bored. From Aphrodite to
Madonna, she leaves the readerwith a greater
understanding of what love is.

written

deals with psychologically confused characters
— but this is part of the movie’s attraction.

The pace of the ﬁlm is almost perfect: there
wasn’t a moment when the ﬁlm lost my atten-
tion, but it refrained from being hurried. The
director, Richard Rush, does an excellent job of
exploiting the paranoia and drama inherent in
the characters and the situation.

A good example is the scene where Capa,
unable to see the color red, is unaware that he is
standing in a pool of blood. The director shows
us the pool in a neutral color, so we don’t know
it’s blood, either. Finally, the pool turns from
black to red when Capa realizes it’s blood, and:
the audience becomes aware at the same time,
and in the same way, as the character does.

Overall, the movie was very reminiscent of

Alfred Hitchcock’s movies (right down to the.
climactic ﬁnal scene, where the female lead
tries to leap from a tower, a la Vertigo). Whereas;
Hitchcock explores the sordid and terrifying.‘
minds of seemingly normal people (eg, Rear’
Window), Richard Rush here explores blatantly .

abnonnal people.

The result is less powerful, but nevertheless
impressive. The film reminded me very much.

of such recent thrillers asshatteredz well-ﬁlmed,

decent enough acting, and a plot with an in-I
triguing twist or two that will keep you inter-I
ested. This is deﬁnitely worth a trip to the dollar 1
theatre or the video store, and, if you (like me) i
are a fan of Bruce Willis, perhaps also to the:

State Cinema.

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

A new perspective

Autumn at Washington and Lee University.

Cooler days.‘ Football. And the annual debate about
whether or not women from other schools should be
nominated as homecoming queen candidates.

Well, we at the Phi would like to know, what about the
men?

Many schools (my high school, for one) choose both a
homecoming queen and king. Why can’t we do this at
Washington and Lee?

Think about it. It would give those mostly-female stu-
dent organizations a chance to get back at all those frater-
nities who traditionally choose girls from other schools.

A strapping cadet nominated by the Preston Society,
perhaps...or maybe a nice Hampden-Sydney student (after‘
all, they were ranked 13th in the Princeton Review for
“Reefer Madness.” They must have some fans at W&L).
I am sure they could use the love and attention.

Perhaps the Men’s Panel could take up this idea as their
platform from which to operate. Everyone needs a cause,
and this would be a great one.

I suppose, in the dark past of all—male W&L, the queen
was a nice decoration for the football game and a great
reason to bring women to the campus for the homecoming
weekend.

But these dark days have brightened with the addition of
women to our great campus (face it, I’m a little bit biased),
and the times they are a-changin’. ,

Escorts emphasize the frivolity of women, to take a
purely feminist standpoint. But king nominees would add
to the regality of the whole affair. Perhaps the homecom-
ing coronation could be more like a coronation, instead of
a debutante ball.

A part of the controversy around homecoming each year
is the idea that the W&L men are not showing the proper
respect for the W&L women by choosing candidates from
other schools.

But if a sorority was forced to choose a nominee for king,
perhaps the respect question could be a reciprocal one.

The Phi does not wholly support the idea of homecom-
ing queens, but we thought it would be germane to the
annual, and rather pointless, homecoming queen debate.
It’s something to think about.

Quote of the Week:

“Kelly Dyer has some girl doing his laundry for
him...how do you think I could get someone to do my
laundry for me?”

-—A Washington and Lee freshman obviously
oblivious to the charm of blonde hair and blue
eyes.

Give police a chance to do their jobs

Imagine it: three men, drunk, pile into theirHyundai
for a night of reckless driving in a major American
urban center. Not surprisingly, the police catch up
with them and begin what the driver turns into a

drawn-out, high—speed pur-
suit, endangering the lives
of everyone involved. Even-

tually the driver sees the

oven

But he resists arrest, as-
saulting the officers that
have converged on the scene.
Twice he fumbles in his
pockets, giving the police
the legal right to shoot him;

they do not. His excited state convinces them he is on
PCP; an attempt to subdue the suspect with a “stun

gun” has no effect.

It is police procedure not to wrestle with a suspect.
He is to be subdued by overwhelming force; all this is
in the training. The police make the fatal mistake;
they do what the City of Los Angeles has entrusted
them to do — they take their truncheons in hand, and
they strike the suspect until he is handcuffed and no
longer a danger to others. They take him to the station,
do their paperwork, and go home to their families;

they go to bed.

Of course, we all know the conclusion to the story.
The officers, principally Lawrence Powell and Stacey
Koon, awake the next morning to find that their arrest
and beating of Rodney King has become the premier
The fateful video-
recording is played again and again. The Simi Valley
trial is held, clearing the officers. A riot ensues. A

Two years later, the policemen are in jail, and

fashioned enough to be-
lieve that criminals do
not deserve cash allot-
ments of $3.8 million;
they deserve to go to jail.

But this is all old
news, you say. Not re-
ally. It was all brought
back to me these past
few days, during which
the American press has
been agitating for
American troops in Haiti
to put an end to the “bru-
tal” treatment of “inno-
cent civilians.”

My point is not that
the media is, in this case,

necessarily wrong. I was more interested in how they
went about proving their point.

The beatings were said to be unreasonable, un-
necessary, inhumane. And how was this proved?

I realize that many people -— most, I should say —
will differ with my characterization of the events in
the case of Rodney King. It was, after all, a “savage”
beating, was it not? I am willing to concede the

possibility that some sort of
_ disciplinary action may have
been called for; Lawrence
Powell may have gone too
far. But that should not over-
ride an even more basic fact:
a man who drives while
drunk, leads the police on a
high—speed chase, and at-
tempts to assault the officers
trying to arrest him, is not a
hero. He is not a symbol of
how the black man has been forever oppressed by
whites. He is, in fact, a criminal. And I am just old-

Pictures, of course! We were treated to a few
pictures of Haitians being hit on the head with
truncheons. Case closed. Background was not ,r
required. The comment of one American soldier
said it all: “It was like Rodney King. It was bad.”
I agree. It was bad, but for a different reason: it
showed up our delusions as a society about police
violence. We no longer need the facts about why
someone is being beaten with a policeman’s baton;
we intuitively know that it is an outrage and must be
stopped. Implicitly, we have decided that no one
ought ever to be hit.

The wider point I am aiming at is this: as Ameri-
cans, we have become soft and stupid. We no
longer live in a world (nor did we ever) where the
bleeding-heart, Sesame Street assumption that “what
everyone needs is a little love” can work. We must
be willing to admit once again that there are hard

edges to the human con-
dition, and that some-
times these edges have

to be smoothed out, not
by therapy, not by cash,
not by support groups,
but by the naked use of
force by the police.

If this society of
rampant crime and even
more rampant social de-
cay is ever to be patched
up and put back to-
gether, we must be will-
ing to make a hard-
nosed, tough determi-
nation — we must be
willing to give the men

who keep law and order in force the means to get the
job done; and we must set aside our squeamishness
and realize that their task is sometimes less than

An inside look at the legal process

Unless you have been in a coma for
the last four or five months, all of you
should know (whether you want to or
not) that jury selection began forthe OJ
Simpson trial this week. Never fear,
this column is not about OJ; instead,
it’s about juries and jury selection. I
feel somewhat
qualiﬁed about

still the State Attorney for that circuit).
I knew several state attorneys, the two
I actually interned for and all of their
friends.

Both the prosecution and defense
started to interrogate me about that
experience: Had I ever had a personal

relationship
with a state

this, having
been on a jury
this summer.
The case was
nowhere as ex-
citing as OJ ’s,
just a simple
case of larceny.

As a pro-
spective juror I
was told to report at 8:00 a.m. to the
jury pool courtroom at the criminal
courthouse. At about 11:00, after I had
watched “Father of the Bride” and about
half of “City Slickers”, my name was
finally called for a panel. Since it was
so late in the morning the bailiff sent us
to lunch. We were supposed to be back
at 12:30, at about 1:45 we were led into
the courtroom. Everyone had to an-
swer a set of written questions that are
used by all the judges in jury selection;
these ranged from years of residency in
Dade County to whether we had ever
been the victim of a crime. The ques-
tion that focused attention on me for a
while was whether I was acquainted
with any State Attorneys.

During my senior year in high
school, I interned at the State Attomey’s
ofﬁce in Miami (while Janet Reno was

 

at to r n e y
(No); had I
ever satin on
juryselection
(Yes-bor-
ing); and
could I be
impartial to-
ward the de-
f e n d a n t

NOVA
CLARKE,
’96

(Yes).

Finally, they moved onto other
members of the pool. At about 3:00 we
were told to wait outside while the
attorneys argued over which j urors they
wanted. At 4:15 we were led in and the
jury was installed in the jury box. I was
surprised to be selected. I had dis-
cussed the likelihood of my being on
the jury with two other women (who
were also selected) and we had decided
that the possibility was nil. The trial
eventually started at 4:30—we never
did get to decide on a verdict since the
state attorney dropped the charges the
next day. V

So what does this have to do with
OJ? A lot. There has been a lot of talk
about jury consultants and what type of
people each side will want on the jury
to get a favorable verdict. I believe that

the only criteria should be that a juror
be fairly educated and citizens without
any outstanding biases. The 7th amend-
ment guarantees a trial by a jury of
one’s peers; not a trial by a jury of
people who do not ﬁdget, or have to
hunt down the ﬁve dollar discrepancy
in the checkbook, or look at the defense
attorney more than the prosecution.
These were some of the things listed in
a recent article that jury consultants
look for. A jury of heterogenous citi-
zens is all one
should ask for.
These people
will more then

guilty or innocent. I do think we would
have reached a verdict that reﬂected
the evidence.

.I think the judicial system in all the
furor over picking the “ideal” juror is
discounting the abilities of you and me,
as well as taking away one of the fun-
damental rights of a citizen.

I will mention one or two other
problems I had with the court system
although these may only be applicable
to the case I was on. First, starting a

Staying awake opens your mind.

GREEN LAND
Betsy Green

In the tine tradition of humor col-
umnists everywhere, I have decided to
experiment with what an utter lack of
sleep will do to my well-being. It’s for
science, really. To make the whole
thing seem more scientiﬁc, I’ve been
popping vitamin pills because that
sounds really official. I’ve also tried to
gauge my alertness by playing Mo-
nopoly with Richard Weaver. It would
probably be a lot less surreal if it weren ’t
all true. Here are the results:

Day One: My insomnia is quite
upsetting because there is no good rea-
son for it. I want to sleep. I’m tired. I’m
feeling no more stress than usual. I
spent a lot of time tonight staring at the
ceiling in my room, pondering noth-
ing. Maybe all that sleep I was doing
was a waste of time. My alertness must
not be seriously compromised because
I beat Richard Weaver at Monopoly
already. He seemed mad when I woke
him up this morning to play. So be it.

Day Two: Not sleeping at night is
one thing, but not sleeping during the
day is quite another. My professors

’ have not seemed too appreciative of

the experiment so far. To appease them,
I have tried to stay awake by drinking
massive amounts of Mountain Dew
and Jolt from the Co-op. In the past, I
thought that these things were a silly
waste of time when you could be drink-

ing something fun like coffee, or better
still, a full Colonnade cup (The Offi-
cial Beverage Holder of Insomnia) of
espresso. Unfortunately, what with all
of the naps I ’ve needed to take, I haven’t
had time to grind my own beans and
make a truly worthwhile cup of coffee.
The coffee from the Co-op only de-

Richard Weaver at Monopoly again.

Day Six: I have been spending a lot
of time at Lee-Hi because, hey — it’s
open. I see Richard Weaver there a lot.
He shrieks and runs away when he sees
my Monopoly board.

Day Seven: My life signs are fail-
ing fast. Even though I have not been

(80 deﬂﬂiefe   SP9!“ f0U1'
microfiberfrom Ex- hours staring at
press), a matching my hand, gig-

black bra, and red running shoes, and
of course a mask. Fighting crime in
Lexington proved less fruitful than I
had hoped. Some kid in front of Sharks
yelled demeaning things at me, so I bit
him in the shoulder. The rest of the
crime that I had to deal with involved
illegal parking. Sadly, my fellow crime-
ﬁghters Baner and R.H. Smith beat me
to it. I cheered myself up by trouncing

gling manically. In spite of this, I beat
Richard Weaver at Monopoly. He
seems depressed.

Day Seventeen: I tried to take a
twenty minute power nap on the ﬂoor
of the Phi darkroom (my secret lair).
Not only did I not sleep, but years of
accumulated spilled chemicals have
seeped dangerously into my body.

Richard Weaver refused to play Mo-

nopoly with me. He does not appreci-
ate science.

Day Twenty: I spent a lot of time
tonight watching Infomercials on TV.
I can hardly wait for my new purchases
to come in the mail. My Susan Powter
tape and Ginsu steak knives will change
my life. I know they will.

Day Twenty-two: My cat’s imagi-
nary friend Myron appeared to me. I
never believed in Myron before. I am
‘considering therapy. Regardless, I think
Myron could beat Richard Weaver at
Monopoly.

Day Twenty-ﬁve: Maybe it’s not
insomnia. Maybe I am becoming noc-
turnal. I will try napping during class
by hanging upside-down from the
rafters of the C-school. I hope this is
does not prove distracting.

Day Thirty: No one knows this,
but I am the master of all. I can ﬂy like
Sally Field in The Flying Nun. I can
read my Economics book in one sit-
ting. I can touch my toes without bend-
ing my knees. Sleep is for the weak.

Day Forty-two: Delirious? Not
me, boy. Hahahahahaha. “Why are you
laughing, Darl? Is it because you hate
the sound of laughing?
Yesyesyesyesyes!”

Myron and Winona Ryder. The rain,
the rain. Why snake phlegm?

Coffee. NOOOO.

I thought you were holding a Blow
Pop. Okay. Hee, hee.

Nope, no delirium here. Final note:
beat Richard Weaver at Monopoly once
more.

Cable 2 News now able to

use CNN sound

III» CABLE, from page 1

Roanoke’s Channel 7 news and CNN
morning news.

Gartin said the old method of using
taped footage instead of satellite-fed
news was inconvenient and inadequate.

“Only two or three of the stories that
we were running in our newscast were

. run on tape, and then we had to go
v through and ﬁnd them,” Gartin said,

“whereas here, it’s already listed for us
(by computer), so we know where to
find it. It’s a lot easier to access, a lot
easier to put into the newscast effec-
tively.”

Albert agreed that the new system is
more efficient.

“We get the tape and we look
through it and see what they have,”
Albert said. “Today they had footage
of Haiti, they had a couple of people
interviewed...they had (O.J.) Simpson
(updates)...and we can use allthatstuff.”

In addition to getting satellite-fed
news, the journalism department paid
for changes in the studio set. Commer-
cial artist Karen Crenshaw of Lexing-
ton painted the Colonnade, a mountain
scene, and downtown Lexington on
the set backdrop. Mike Gorman of the
W&Ltheaterdepartment also designed
an awning, new desks, and risers for
the set, which Buildings and Grounds
workers built. .

With all of the new capabilities,

"Cable 2 producers and cameramen

might have a hecticfirst week of broad-
casting. The news show is scheduled
for broadcast from Monday through
Thursday at 5:30 p.m.

Problems in using the new footage
might come from a lack of student
journalists who understand how to in-
corporate it into broadcasts.

“We don’t have enough manpower,”
said senior Tricia Coughlin, Cable 2
news director, “and the writers have to
write (a story that lasts) a certain amount
of time before the sound on the tape
comes on.”

Broadcast journalism professor Rob-
ert de Maria agreed that the station
needs more writers and student-pro-
duced shows.

least have the facilities to get people

non-speciﬁc character charges against Robb “ridiculous”
and unfounded, saying that many voters had “short memo-
ries” when it came-to her father’s record of service to
Virginia that allowed charges of marital inﬁdelity and pos-
sible involvement with drugs or drug users to gain a foothold
in the public mind, even though unsupported by any credible

evidence.

She also predicted that the withdrawal of the independent
Democratic candidate, former Governor. Douglas Wilder,
from the Senate contest would allow constituencies which
had been conflicted on whether to support Robb or Wilder to

move solidly into the Robb camp.

“This was the biggest Democratic gathering ever, except
for Mock Convention,” said senior Andy Wright.

Many undergraduates here at
W&L hardly even know that there is
a law school here on the campus, but
in fact a vibrant community exists
right over the footbridge at Lewis
Hall, home to the W&L School
of Law.

A driving force, both socially and
academically, at the law school isthe
Student Bar Association. Shawn
Copeland, president of the SBA, de-
scribed his organization as “like the
Student Activities Board” on the un-
dergraduate campus, but with some
additional functions, which Copeland
explained as “quasi-academic.”
Mostly, this involves working with
other organizations, such as Con-
tact, to bring speakers to the law
school campus.

The SBA has already sponsored a
number of both social and academic
events. last Friday, the SBA spon-
sored a “Night Under the StarS” out-
side of the law school, where law
students had a chance to display their

talents (or lack thereof). The SBA
was also represented at the Foxﬁeld
Races in Charlottesville, with two
buses of tailgaters reveling in the
day’s activities.

The SBA has also sponsored some
speakers and symposiums on the law
school campus. On September 23,
the SBA hosted a law symposium
discussing the legal ramifications of
new reproductive technology. Last
Monday, Edward Cleary, an attor-
ney and author, discussed freedom
of expression and political correct-
ness at the law school.

Upcoming social events at the
law school include tailgating at
Homecoming this weekend, a
“Bridge the Gap” party, where law
school students and seniors on the
undergraduate campus get together
for an evening of food, drink and
socializing on the last weekend in
October, as well as a Halloween party
at Zollman’s Pavilion.

Upcoming speakers, whose dates

Pto b Betsy Green, The Ring-tum Phi

Law Notes

of arrival have yet to be determined,
include Jay Sekulow, an attorney
who has argued before the Supreme
Court on issues such as freedom of
expression and religion; Frank
Bolden, a Wall Street corporate at-
tomey for Johnson & Johnson (also
sponsored by the Black Law Student
Association); as well as the chief
legal counsel for the CIA.

W&L undergraduate students
may wonder what these activities at
the law school have to offer to them.
As Copeland puts it, “these speakers
touch on issues other than strictly
academic issues,” and can also pro-
vide undergraduate students “with a
whole new perspective.” They have
already been through college, along
with all the experiences (good and
bad) that a college student goes
through. They also know what life
after college is like, and can provide
an undergraduate student with
some valuable advice on life
after graduation.

Women’s soccer gets off to fast start to 94 season -—

/we’re playing a game. It doesn’t

By JOSHUA HESLINGA
Phi Staff Writer

Washington and Lee’s
women’s soccer team suffered
their second setback of the sea-
son at the hands of The College
of Wooster 4-0 last Saturday,
dropping the Generals to 3-2 with
eight games remaining.

Coming off their 10-1 explo-
sion against Hollins College, the
Generals found themselves at a
loss for offense Saturday.

Their defense remained
strong, largely controlling the
College of Wooster’s attack, de-

spite missing the experience of
sophomore goalie Beth Mozena.

Coach Jan Hathom declined
to cite Mozena’s absence or the
extended travel as excuses for
the ﬁnal result, saying, “I don’t
think it was the travel. I don’t
think it was one thing really. We
weren’t conﬁdent without Beth
in goal, and we weren’t ready to
play our game.”

That sentiment was echoed
by senior forward Anne Spruill,
who ﬁlled in for Mozena against
the College of Wooster, saying,
“We never found the rhythm. We
just didn’t connect.”

The team is looking forward

to Mozena’s return, which may
be Thursday against Mary
Baldwin.

However, Coach Hathorn
stated that, “We’re not pushing
it, ” and she expects Mozena to
be 100% this Saturday for the
game against tough ODAC rival
Randolph Macon.

For the duration of Mozena’s
absence, freshman Delia Coyle
is expected to use her past expe-
rience to take over as goalie.

Indeed, one of the General’s
greatest strengths is their young
talent. As one of the team’s se-
nior co-captains, Spruill empha-
sized the nature of the relation-

ship of the more experienced
players to their younger com-
rades,saying,“'I'heyoungerplay-
ers have an incredible amount of
skill. The older players just try to
show them the focus that they
need game by game.”

Fellow senior Kait Barton
agreed, observing that ”I think
that in the young players is where
we have most of our potential.”

Yet, as the Generals move to
a series of games that Coach
Hathom has labeled critical, all
sides agreed that eliminating the
negatives of inexperience was
the primary focus.

Coach Hathom cautioned that

The Washington and Lee
water polo team visited An-
napolis for the second time in
as many weekends hoping for
better fare in the won-loss de-
partment.

The team came out of the
weekend with a 1-2 mark in
NCAA games and a close loss
to the New York Athletic Club.

In the first game, W&L ex-
acted a measure of revenge by
beating the Navy ‘B’ team by
the score of 14-12. The second
game, however, saw the Gen-
erals lose to Brown 12-7.

In the third game of the
day, the W&L squad played a
team of former college play-
ers in the New York Athletic
Club. Originally, the team
went into the game with the
intent of just playing every-
body and resting for the mar-
quis game against 15th ranked
Bucknell.

However, after watching a
four goal lead go by the boards,
the W&L team really got into
the action, ﬁghting it out to a
close loss in overtime.

Against Bucknell in the ﬁ-
nal game, the Generals took
the 15th ranked giant to the
wire, losing by the score of 13-
12 in overtime once again.

One of the stars for the Gen-
erals was sophomore James
Silberstein, who tallied ten
goals in the tournament.

Despite the 3-7 record for the
season to date, team coach Paige
Remillard was optimistic about
the team.

“We’re playing top teams in
the country,” said the coach.

The team has dropped a num-
ber of extremely close games to
powerful opponents this season.
One example of this was the over-
time loss to Bucknell this past
weekend.

When asked if he was both-
ered by the sub — .500 record
despite the close losses,
Remilalrd responded by saying,

Water Polo headed North

“Losing doesn’t upset me; play-
ing poorly upsets me. We’ve got
the athletic ability. We’re going
to reverse these scores. I really
believe that.”

The team has maintained a
consistent level of play through-
out the season and eventually the
close games should begin to go
the other way.

Remillard summed it up suc-
cinctly, “There’s a train coming
down the track And I don’t think
a lot of people see it.”

“We’re a young team, and people
haven’t learned to balance work
and things and take care of them-
selves yet,” but added that lead-
ership was one of the team’s
strengths. “Our captains and se-
niors are doing a great job.”
From the players side, Barton
remarked, “Because they’re
young, it’s tough for them [the
younger players] to be mentally
ready all the time because it’s
their ﬁrst experience with col-
lege soccer. They need to know
that we ’re human and that ’s OK.”
Spruill also showed resolve,
saying, “As a team, we’re all just
ready to focus on the fact that

matter who we play, we just need,
to be ready each time.” "

Following Randolph Macon
on Saturday, the Generals will
travel to the women’s college of
Sweet Briar, and then enjoy three
successive home games against!
the always tough Guilford,
Roanoke, and Swarthmore.

Coach Hathom remarked of
the challenge, “Every game’s a
tough game when you play [those
schools], and we have all those}
coming up.”

Note—The Generalsdefeated
Mary Baldwin by the score of 7-
0 after this article was written.

BY TORY Noro AND
JASON Trarmzns

To our loyal readers, we are
sincerely sorry we have been on
hiatus.

Unfortunately for the authors,
our favorite teams the Giants and
the Eagles, respectively, had a
bye week. As a result, it was not
one of the more interesting weeks
in the NFL.

The most interesting matchup
of the week involved two Super
Bowl contenders, the Miami
Dolphins and the Minnesota Vi-
kings.

To the chagrin of the many
fair-weather Dolphin fans we
know, the Dolphins fell behind
early and were unable to stop
Warren and the Vikes. After an

ugly ﬁrst half, Dan Marino ral-
lied the Fins and tied the game
but his superior performance
went to waste as the Vikings won
with a late charge.

For the ﬁrst time in his illus-
trious career, the aging Joe Mon-
tana was shut out. The Chiefs
fell to the lowly Rams, who were
led by a typical solid performance
by Jerome “Bam-Bam” Bettis.

Never during the much an-
ticipated battle of the Bays was
Tampa accused of being a stellar
football team.

The Northern version dis-
mantled the Bucs with a relent-
less attack led by the rejuvenated
Brett “INT” Farve and a feisty
defensive performance.

The Cincinnati Bungles were
dispatched by the non-threaten-

ing Cody Carlson and the Hous-
ton Oilers.

For those local fans, the Wash-
ington Redskins fell prey to the

 New DUI laws claim 3 students

breathalizer tests to everyone in the car, but
only after Christ was removed for a sobriety
field-test.

“First, they checked my eyes with the ﬂash-

The newly-enacted drunk driving law that
makes it illegal for those under twenty-one to
drive with a blood alcohol content level of 0.02
or higher nabbed two victims from Washington
and Lee University over Homecoming Week-
end. The third came early Thursday morning.

Around 1:40 a.m., freshman Erik Christ and
six passengers were on their way to Lee-Hi
Truck Stop when he was pulled over near the
Stop-In convenience store for a broken tail
light. He was subsequently arrested for driving
under the inﬂuence.

The third student arrest since the new law
came into effect July 1, 1994, clearly indicates
that the Lexington Police are not taking the new
law lightly.

Senior Aki Nichols was a witness to the
most recent arrest. He saw that the police had
stopped the vehicle which Christ was driving
and commented that the car was full of “mostly
drunk people.”

Apparently, the police administered

light,” Christ said. Next, he was asked to walk
nine steps in a straight line, turn around and
walk back. Finally, he was asked to hold his
foot up in the air for thirty seconds. Christ
performed these tests adequately. Nichols said
he believed Christ to only have had one drink,
and Christ said he “was sober.”

After the sobriety test, the police adminis-
tered a breathalizer test. Christ’s BAC levels
ﬂucuated dramatically between two separate
administrations around the legal limit of 0.02.
This granted them sufﬁcient cause to arrest
Christ for driving under the inﬂuence as a
minor and he was taken to the Rockbridge
County Jail.

The car keys were given to another passen-
ger in the car whom the police deemed sober
enough to drive safely.

At the County Jail, Christ was given yet
another breathalizer test. His BAC was found to
be 0.03. Christ was formally charged with driv-
ing under the inﬂuence and faces stricter penal-

ties for being under twenty-one. Later Christ
told arresting police that he believed he was
capable of driving and had only one drink.

An interviewing ofﬂcer told Christ that with
a BAC of 0.03, “even if you can recite the
alphabet or walk on one foot, you’re legally
drunk. It’s like one hit of cocaine is against the
law —one drink is against the law for a minor.”

He pointed out that had the incident oc-
curred before July 1, police would have recom-
mended Christ have someone else drive, but he
would not have been in violation of the law. The
interviewing ofﬂcer added that since this was
Christ’s ﬂrst offense, the judge may be lenient
with him.

He also said that since the law was fairly new
and untested, there may be some legal loop-
holes that may extricate him.

Sergeant Joe Rader of the State Police ad-
ministered the breathalizer test in the County
Jail.

“Under the new law, it’s illegal for a minor
to drive with a BAC over 0.02 in Virginia. It
became effective July 1,” he said.

Arresting officer Mark Riley said, ‘‘I pulled
the car over for a broken tail light.” It was only

after an investigation of the car’s driver and
passengers that Riley suspected alcohol. Given
the fact that Christ was a minor with some
alcohol in his system, it became evident that
Riley would need to make an arrest.

He pointed out that the legal limit for a
twenty-one year old to drive is a 0.08 BAC.
This is four times as much as the legal limit for
an underage person. ,

Had Christ been of age, the arrest would
have never occurred. “Basically,” Riley said,
“if you’re under twenty-one you can’t consume
alcohol and then drive.”

Penalties for violating the law include revo-
cation of one’s license for a six-month period,
a $500 fine, and attendance of an Alcohol
Safety Action Program. Rader pointed out,
“The idea behind these laws is to keep young
kids from driving drunk.”

He added, “Students need to be aware of the
new law because Virginia has one of the tough-
est D.U.I. laws in the nation.”

Upon Christ’s release around 4:00 a.m. from
the County Jail, he ironically said he felt, “a lot
more sober than I should feel after being ar-
rested” for driving under the inﬂuence.

The court date is set for October 18 and
Christ jokingly asks, “if someone could find
him a free third-year law student” for represen-
tation.

When asked by The Ring-tum Phi if the new
law has been effective, Lexington Police Cheif
Bruce Beard said, “lt’s still too early to tell.”

If police continue their rigorous enforce-
ment of the law, and the trend of arrests contin-
ues, W&L students will have to re-examine
their attitudes about drinking and driving.

Beer sales at the Pavillion show that stu-
dents may already be modifying their behavior.
Sales at the beer garden have dropped at this
year’s two concerts. While normally beer from
all six kegs are sold, only two and a half kegs
have been sold at each of the concerts.

This is odd, says Mike Young, Director of
Security, because “the amount of bodies in the
beer garden has been the same.”

“We haven’t seen the amount of intoxica-
tion at concerts this year,” said Young.

One possible reason for this, said Young, “is
the DUI laws.

People may be being smarter about the
amount of alcohol they consume.”

Houston A. Baker, Jr. spoke
as the guest of honor at the 13th
annual Shannon-Clark lecture in
a packed Northern Auditorium
Thursday night.

4 Since the late 1960s, Baker
has made significant contribu-
tions to the ﬁelds of criticism,
theory and creative writing of
African-American literature

‘ and culture.

A native of Louisville, Ken-
tucky, Baker received his
eduaction from Howard Univer-
sity, University of Edinburgh, and
University of California at
Los Angeles.

‘ Baker is currently director of
the Center for the Study of Black
Literature and Culture, Profes-
sor of English, and Albert M.

4 Greenﬁeld Professor at the Uni-

versity of Pennsylvania.

According to Professor
Severn Duvall, who introduced
Baker, the “central thesis” of
Baker’s work is that the “appro-
priate way to appreciate black
literature should not derive from
white culture,” but rather
from the “black literary
tradition itself.”

Baker began his speech en-
titled “Everybody Knows The
Real Thing, But Magic Brings
Us Home: Multicultural Notes”
with a story from Greek and Clas-
sical lore. In the tale, the artist
Zeuxis painted a picture of grapes
so realistic that it fooled even
birds.

Baker followed the story by
questioning what, in fact, Real-
ism is. This he intended to ex-
plore, in terms of
multiculturalism. Baker drew
first on his own childhood expe-

riences in a 1940’s America

that wouldn’t recognize
other cultures. .
America, Baker argued, lost

forever its Old World culture
with the introduction of the Af-
rican slave trade. He sees mod-
ern American culture as dis-
tinctly “New World,” a
blending of several and even
many cultures.

To reinforce this idea, Baker
borrowed a quote from James
Baldwin’s Stranger In The Vil-
lage : “The world is white no
longer, and it never will be
white again.”

There is no returning, Baker
says, to past cultural traditions.
We are now, and permanently, a
society of many cultures, one of
“multiculturalism.”

What Baker refers to as “that
elusive present day vocabulary
item,” multiculturalism has

‘Baker speaks of magic
and multiculturism

many connotations in today’s
world. Baker explains the word
can apply to situations as differ-
ent as “curriculum reform in New
York,” and a “food festival in
the sunny Southwest.”

To Baker, multiculturalism
is a “real, artistic thing” that
“goes to the very heart of
education...in, of, for, and by
art.” This art occurs when the
borders dividing different cul-
tures blend together. Baker as-
signs the tenn “magic realism”
to this moment of blending.

Baker closed his speech in a
moving rendition of a poem by
Michael Harper, entitled “Our
Supreme Hope.”

Baker returned to his seat
amidst enthuisiastic applause
from the audience, and spoke
with W&L faculty and students
alike in the ensuing reception in
the Boatwright Room.

Two Homecoming
ﬂoats lose riders

By ETHAN KRUPP
Phi News Editor

Washington and Lee students
were thrown from two homecom-
ing ﬂoats during the parade last
weekend.

A freshman pledge of Pi Kappa
Alpha was thrown from his
fratemity’s ﬂoat and several mem-
bers of Kappa Kappa Gamma also
fell from their sorority’s ﬂoat.

According to Lexington Police
Chief Bruce Beard, the PiKa ﬂoat
was coming to the end of the pa-
rade route by the Lenfest Center
for the Perfonning Arts, where
Lexington Police Sergeant T.H.
Penderson was directing traffic.
The driver pulling the ﬂatbed
trailer, PiKa sophomore Atticus
Gill, was told to turn right, but
wanted “go left, back up Nelson
St.,” said Beard.

Penderson approached the ﬂoat
and told the driver to go left. Gill
then “backed the ﬂoat up (to turn
right), gunned the engine, and

jerked the float,” according

to Beard.

It was the jerking of the ﬂoat
that caused freshman Andrew
Curry to be thrown some 45 feet,
according to the report.

“He ﬂew off the back of the
trailer, hit the ground and then hit
his head against the bumper of a
stopped truck,” said Mike Young,
Director of University Security.

An ambulance took Curry to
Stonewall Jackson Hospital
where he was treated for cut on
his chin, a bruised jaw, and a
bruised side of the head, and then
released, according to Young.

When contacted, Gill who was
charged with reckless driving for
the incident, said he was, “guilty
of nothing and intend[s] to take
the case to court.”

Gill said that he did originally
want to turn left, but when the
officer “got in his face,” he re-
lented and agreed to back the
ﬂoat up.

“I was forced to back the trailer
up, something I did not feel com-
fortable doing,” Gill said. He then
“put it in drive and accelerated.”

The acceleration was from
zero to ﬁve miles an hour, ac-
cording to Gill, who also said
that “[Curry] rolled no more than
15 feet. Simple physics say
[Curry’s fall] can’t happen.”

Gill wondered how he could
be charged with reckless driving
if there were “ten guys and a
loosely attached sign” on the ﬂoat

during Parade

that did not fall off. The whole
thing was an “over-reaction of
the Lexington Police Depart-
ment,” according to Gill.

Curry said that he was not cut
on his face, but on his shoulder.
He also said he did not blame
Gill for the incident. Curry has
been subpoenaed for Gill’s court
date and feels that they are “in
this together.” Curry said he was
just in “the wrong place at the
wrong time.”

Kappa sophomore Hollis
Leddy and two other Kappas also
fell from their ﬂoat near the in-
tersection of Jefferson St. and
Washington St’.

Leddy said the ﬂoat was
stopped and the three Kappas
“were standing on the back of the
ﬂoat” when the driver “started
up again.”

She said that they were not
anticipating the acceleration and
fell onto the concrete in front of
the ﬁre engine that was follow-
ing them in the parade. Others
Kappas who were standing in a

shoe built on the ﬂoat fell onto
it when the car pulling the
trailer accelerated.

Leddy said no one was hurt
and they “just got up and ran
after the ﬂoat.”

leaked or broken completely off the ship.

64 foreign students enjoy Virginia
countryside While attending W&L

By CINDY YOUNG
Phi Staff Writer

“Washington & Lee University is
pleased to receive and review applica-
tions for admissions from international
students,” reads the W&L Catalogue
for the 1994-95 school year.

This year, 64 students accepted this
invitation, and are now here
on campus.

As Ann Rogers, Director of East
Asian Studies, says, “we have a rich
diversity of countries represented
this year.”

A sampling of the different couri-
tries from which these students came
includes Russia, Spain, Bulgaria,
Egypt, Peru, the United Kingdom, Ja-
maica, Switzerland, South Africa and
the Netherlands.

All in all, this year’s international
students hail from thirty—one countries,
and nearly every continent.

Of these students, 46 are non-resi-
dent, non-citizen degree candidates.

Eight international students at W&L
are participating through an exchange
program or are studying as non-degree
candidates, and the remaining 10 stu-

dents are U.S. citizens currently
living abroad.
Why study in the United States?
An exchange student from the J apa-
nese university Kansai Gansai, Maki
Kawaguchi chose to attend school in
America because she “wanted to study
something that had
real meaning.”
Her courses in
Japan had all been
English classes.
German student
Arne Holick-
Kuhlmann, ’98 adds
that the “style” of
teaching is so differ-
ent from that in his
home country. In Ger-
man universities,
hundreds of students
are often in one
class together.
Asked why they
chose this school,
these students have varying responses.
Robin Howe, a freshman from the
United Kingdom, explains that this was
“the first school I’d heard of.” A decid-
ing factor for him to attend W&L was
the fact that “everybody loved it here.”
Terence O’Hare, also a freshman,

ties and sororities.”

“It was excellent because it was a showcase for

student talent,” she said.

 

Rogers

chose W&Lbased on its being “a small,
good school on the East Coast.”

Arne Holick-Kuhlmann simply
“read about it” in college information
guides, and “sent for more inforrna—
tion.” He liked the information he re-
ceived, and applied.

Having worked
with many exchange
students both from
America and abroad,
Ann Rogers offers a
general explanation
on why W&L itself
might appeal to inter-
national students.

“We are a small
school,” Rogers em-
phasizes, which is to
say “we [professors]
offer fairly close su-
pervision [of stu-
dents].” The close
student-teacher rela-
tionships that set
W&L apart even from many American
schools are unusual for the universities
of most foreign nations. In addition to
these reasons, the strong academic
character of W&L is by no
means unimportant.

Upon arriving here, the social life of

Student artists searching for a social outlet have a
new organization called the Society for the Arts.

Senior Jonathan Van Dyke said he founded the
organization because some students saw a need for it.
According to their mission statement, the Society for
the Arts seeks to foster “an awareness of all the arts,
including the performing arts, the fine arts, and
creative writing.” The organization also seeks to
create a forum for student artists and students who are
interested in the arts to congregate.

Van Dyke founded the organization last spring.
Their first event was a poetry reading at the Liberty
Hall Ruins, featuring Ashlie Kauffman,Temple Cone,
Matt Jackson, Jonathan Van Dyke, Jake Berman, and
Sarah Drain. Junior Julie Powell also organized a
farewell recital for junior Meagan Miller who is now
attending the Julliard School.

The concert also featured the performances of
Herman Safin, ’94, David Wilmington, ’94, and
Hilary Rhodes, ’96.

This year the Society for the Arts sponsored an
acoustic coffeehouse concert, featurin g juniors Bryan
Boland and Tommy Esposito.

Van Dyke said the concert was well attended. He
said it showed a need for alternative social activities.

Sophomore member Sarah Anne Ryder said she
heard a lot of feedback about the concert.

“I thought it was a very good way for men and
women to mix,” she said. “Usually it’s just fratemi-

Powell said students are becoming increasingly
interested in coffeehouses. She said at least two more
coffeehouses are being planned. Neither have stu-
dent musicians.

Ryder said the organization is planning a fall
poetry reading at the Liberty ruins in the next
few weeks featuring Temple Cone and some
other readers.

“It’s a good opportunity to hear what students are
writing,” she said “It’s generally an appreciation for
different types of work.” She said the organization is
working closely with Student Activities Coordinator
Michelle Richardson.

She said they are tentatively planning an arts event
that would include painting, drawing, musicians,
theater, etc.

“It would be an interesting way to show what
W&L has to offer,” she said.

According to the proposal presented to the Execu-
tive Committee budget hearings, the organization is
tentatively planning four poetry/prose readings and
will continue to feature student musicians. During
the student art exhibit, the Society will sponsor a
purchase prize for one outstanding student art piece.
It will pay for the framing and arrange that it be hung
on campus. Powell said there is a need for a avenue
through which students can showcase their talents.

“It was formed for people who are artists,”
she said.

Washington and Lee often provides
not a little surprise to international
students.

Maki Kawaguchi expresses a cer-
tain degree of amazement at the strength
of the fraternity system on campus.
“There’s no such thing as a fraternity”
in Japan, Kawaguchi remarks. The
amount of money spezit on bands and
parties here seems, to her, amazing.

Robin Howe echoes this surprise.
The fraternity system, Howe says,
“blew me away.” But he has since
pledged and is “having fun!”

Fun, after all, is the purpose of study-
ing in an international setting, along
with the obvious educational beneﬁts.
American students interested in enjoy-
ing this opportunity are invited and
encouraged by Ann Rogers, on behalf
of all the faculty, to study abroad.

Rogers extends a warm welcome to
anyone wishing to spend a term or a
year in the People’s Republic of China,
Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Japan to in-
quire about applications in the East
Asian Language Center. Applications
are due November 1.

W&L students interested in foreign
studies elsewhere are encouraged
to seek information from that
respective department.

 

 

‘I/l/@“L ife

Nostalgic, slow-paced film an essential
part of the W&L experience

By RICHARD WEAVER
Phi Staff Writer

The Foreign Student is a small ﬁlm. View-
ers should appreciate for what it is: a whimsical
look at college life and pressures in the South in
the 1950s.

I saw the ﬁlm the first day it opened in July
in Washington, and the three other people in the
theater and I enjoyed it.

Unfortunately, Foreign Student had poor
advertising support and came out amid a clutter
of other ﬁlms with more starpower than Robin
Givens and Marco Hofschneider.

Though I cannot prove it, I also believe the
ﬁlm’s poor box ofﬁce revenue (a little over
$100,000) is also directly related to my perfor-
mance in the ﬁlm ending up onthe cutting room
ﬂoor.

Not that I am bitter; it’s just that I now swear
I will never, ever again do a ﬁlm with Robin
Givens in it.

Despite my disappointment, there were
plenty of other W&L faces in the movie.

The small town feel of W&L translates well

I guess I am biased, but I think the ﬁlm
wouldn’t have looked authentic in any other
setting. The ﬁlm is slow-paced, and that deﬁ-
nitely adds to its appeal. Foreign Student is a
ﬁlm of nostalgia that seems as if it were an oft-
repeated dream.

Marco Hofschneider is perfect as French
student Philippe Leclerc.

Philippe is the perfect innocent in love and
friendship and practice.

He rides his luck through college in a way
that endears him to the audience.

When he is arrested for drunk driving he is
rescued by a professor who scolds him as if
were a child.

Hofschneider makes the child believable,
and the audience forgives him for not living up
to American expectations and practice.

My favorite part of the ﬁlm is its soundtrack,
which is unfortunately unavailable.

Philippe goesintoabluesclubwhere Howlin’

script plague ﬁlm

By ETHAN KRUPP
Phi Staff Writer

When I went to see the Foreign Student, I
was aware of the negative press surrounding
the movie, but I wanted to give it a fair chance.
I had heard the book the movie is based on was
am enjoyable one and that some scenes had
been ﬁlmed here, but this was all.

After seeing the movie, I can safely agree
with the bad reviews it has received, and I can
give it one more.

The movie starts of slow and drags its feet all
the way through with a few exceptions. The
entire plotline seems contrived and forced. The
two leads, Marco Hofschneider and Robin Giv-
ens, do not relax and enjoy themselves in the
love the script says they have found. The major-
ity of the lines that are supposed to be romantic

, are just too corny to been taken romantically.

' The movie was enjoyable during the scene

‘ at the black nightclub. The arguing about
whether or not Phillippe would get in was
enjoyable. The blues performance by Howlin’
Wolf was well done and a pleasure to listen to.
Other than the scene with the Colonnade in it,
this was the only time I enjoyed the movie.

I think the worse part of the movie was at the
end when Phillippe and April are upstairs
together while the English professor read the

. ' romantic Byron poem downstairs. Throughout

the scene, the actions of Phillippe and April
match the actions described in the poem. It was
exactly the sort of corny acting that my Drama
1 teacher in junior high described as “crap.”
During this scene, her hatred for this poor
acting was all I could think of.

The Foreign Student tries to hard to be
something it can never be. It wants to be a
sweet, romantic, lovely movie so badly that it
tramples all of the emotions Hofschneider and
Givens were able to act out.

When I saw my gorgeous red hair ﬂash
across the screen, I knew it was a good movie.
(Yes, I was in it, Richard! Four times!)

Despite the fact that Marco Hofschneider’s
screams of glee at the end of the football scene
sounded like the squeals of a baby pig, despite
the gratuitous Sharon Stone-like sex scene be-
tween Marco and Robin Givens, the Foreign
Student was a wonderful movie.

This is the stuff that cult movies are made of.

I will never forget those high-pitched
“Yay!”’s of Hofschneider after he beat all the
odds and threw the football into the end zone to
win his friend the quarterback a new Caddy.

Nor will I forget that great scene where Howl-
ing Wolf, the big bad black blues singer from
Chicago, takes “Phillippe” under his wing,
which, incidentally, was the best part of
the movie. TI
Let's forget for a moment that the movie was
based so loosely on the book by Philipe Labro
that none of the important scenes had any basis
in fact. Let’s pretend that this was a purely

F fanciful movie about what Washington and Lee

have got it about right. V.

You can be sure that there were many stu_;
dents like Cal (played by Richard Johnson), the
star football player whose parents were alco,-'
holics and was headed down the same road
himself. Someone arriving at his fraternity house
in the middle of the night, alone and drunk, was
more frightening for Phillipe and April than it’
would have been for any current or former
students of W&L. ‘

The River Wild - itiirik

This latest ﬁlm from Meryl Streep
features her in a role we might not
expect to see her in, the heroine of an
action ﬂick.

The ﬁlm is The River Wild, a very
good drama that is clean and uplifting,
yet still tense enough to satisfy the
most disgruntled college student.

Streep plays Gayle, a teacher and
mother whose marriage is on the rocks.
Her husband Tom, played by David
Strathairn, is an architect who can’t
seem to leave the ofﬁce behind — in
fact, work almost prevents him from
going with his family on a river-
rafting vacation.

The project ofa family rafting in the
western wilderness for several days is
not as difﬁcult as it might seem, be-
cause Gayle grew up in the area and
was in her younger days a daring
river guide.

Thanks to this experience of hers,
two men whose guide ran out on them
in the middle ofthe trip persuade herto
help them down the river, too.

And so the stage is set, as the ﬁve
people in the two boats make theirway
down the river.

But things soon begin to seem
strange, and what was meant to be a
great family bonding
experience crumbles.

One ofthe men, Wade (Kevin Ba-
con), befriends the young son, Roarke,
and slowly begins to press himself on
Gayle — separating Tom from his
family even further.

However, Wade goes a little too

far, and the family decides to leave the
two men behind and continue on down
the river alone.

At this point, the masks come off,
and Wade and Terry reveal their
true colors.

They are actually thieves who held
up a local cattle auction, and they are
being clevercriminals and makingtheir
getaway down the isolated river.

But their plan has an extra element
other nature enthusiasts wouldn ’t take:
they want to go past the normal stop-
ping point, into an area the park service
has long since decided was unsafe,
the Gauntlet.

In this narrow run, three rivers come
together all at once, and drop almost
three-hundred feet in less than a mile.

And, since neither Terry nor Wade
is an experienced river guide, they force
Gayle to lead them safely through
the Gauntlet. V

The remainder of the ﬁlm is a battle

between the family and the criminals,
as they progress down the river.

What is most remarkable about this
ﬁlm is that it does not succumb to some
sort of pretension about making the
movie’s conﬂict between man and na-
ture, or between Gayle’s present and
her past, or anything overly compli-
cated or academic like that.

Rather, the script, written by Denis
O’Neill, stays true to a much more
entertaining, lively and
obvious conﬂict.

The tension is in Ward and Terry
versus Gayle and Tom, or more often,
simply between Ward and Gayle.

The result is sort of strange, because
some of the lowest moments of tension
in the ﬁlm are when the ﬂimsy rafts
enter the thundering, destructive white
water rapids.

So the grandeur and power of the
setting — the majesty of the panoramic
mountain backdrops and the roar of the

Kudos also go to the director, Curtis _ j

Thus, the director is able to take a 
very relaxed ride down the river of this  :

In the end, the movie reminded me I

very much of Stallone’s Cliffhanger, E
as they are both wilderness thrillers.

This ﬁlm is also able to provide a 3;
handsome moral at the end, as the con-  ,
ﬂict reunites a broken family, redeem- 1 »

ing Tom in the eyes of his wife and son,
and bringing Gayle back to the height
of feminine fortitude she enjoyed in
younger days.

If you are looking for a good drama,
well acted, well shot and well scripted,
The River Wild is perfect.

You will not leave the theater feel-

scenes with the love-struck pair.
In the words of one audience
member, “I think a fifth-
grader could have written
better material.”

ShannenJamieson,W&L’97,
said, “it was cheesy and had a lot
of bad acting. The only cool part
was when I saw the few people
I knew.”

Linda Perkins confessed the
only reason she liked it was be-
cause her son, John was in the
movie. “He played a football
player, you know, the one who
smashed his head against the
wall.” Her husband nodded
in agreement.

An older couple who exited

thetheaterlaughing uproariously
pronounced the film, “Wretched.
Corny. Stupid. It didn’t resemble
the book at all.”

One man had a specific point
of criticism that, “Robin Givens
didn’t seem to enjoy the sex.” He
was referring to the one love scene
in the film.

Steve Frame, W&L ’97,
added, “You’ll appreciate it only
if you’re a student of this fine
institution, but maybe even then
you still won’t be able to under-
stand it.”

Despite the negative re-
sponses, there were some view-
ers who liked “Foreign Student.”
One older gentleman said, “I ac-
tually thought it was well done.”

Kathy Moritz and Chris

Rudasill said, “We enjoyed it. It
was a good story.” The couple
also referred to the mountainous
scenery of the Shenandoah Val-
ley as one of the movie’s
strong points.

The State Theater Assistant
Manager, Chad Coleman, also
liked the movie. He particularly
commented on what he believed
to be the realistic portrayal of a
Parisian in the American South
in the 1950’s. He regretted to say
that the movie was not doing
very well and would be out of the
theater before Thursday, Octo-
ber 6. He blamed the film’s poor
showing on Washington and
Lee’s Homecoming Weekend.
Others, most definitely, would
contend that explanation.

Liberty Hall Ruins get

reconstruction

By SioNi PAGE
Phi Staff Writer

As some Washington and Lee
students may have noticed at
Saturday’s tailgate party, the
university’s landmark Liberty
Hall Ruins have been undergo-
ing an extensive remodeling job.
Though the idea of reconstruct-
ing a ruin may seem bizarre at
first thought, when considering
the vast role that the hall has
played in the history of the school,
it makes a great deal of sense.

Liberty Hall was the original
building of what has now be-
come Washington and Lee Uni-
versity. Before either George
Washington or Robert E. Lee
played out their all-important
roles in the story of W&L, Lib-
erty Hall was founded as a small
school enrolling approximately
twenty-ﬁve students.

The hall was originally built
when the school was founded in
May of 1776. At that time, it was
a small building, 24 by 28 feet
with one and a half stories.

In 1784, the hall was burned
down for the first time and was
not rebuilt until 1793 when its

size was increased to three sto-
ries with dimensions of 30 by 38
feet. The building had twelve
rooms of approximately 15 feet
square each.

The new building served as
the school until 1802 when it was
again burnt to the ground, this
time never to be rebuilt. The de-

cision was made tobuildthe new " ...  v - I _

school hall on a different loca-

tion, leaving the Liberty Hall ru-

ins standing as they are today.
The fact that the ruins have

stood forso longisatestament to  .7  I ‘

how wellthe stonework was built.
However, after 192 years, the
ruins are finally getting an over-
haul.

The reconstruction process is
called “stabilization” and is be-
ing done by Traditional Stone
Masonry, a business located in
Middleberg. In an interview with
the Phi, one of the workmen ex-
plained the stabilization process.

The method the workers use
is called “pointing” and involves
replacing the ancient, worn out
mortar ﬁlling by refilling the
cracks between the stones with
new mortar. This work should
add many more years to the life
of the ruins of Liberty Hall.

FLC abuzz with ideas, plans for a great year

Ariel plans for improved year, more issues

By KO-MING CHANG
Phi Staff Writer

All the writers, artists and photographers at
Washington and Lee who are seeking an outlet for
their creative talents should find out more about the
Ariel, the school’s literary magazine.

Many students seem to have heard about the
Ariel, but surprisingly few people submit work to
the annual publication.

A liberal arts institution as fine as Washington
and Lee (it is, after all, number 15 in the nation)
should be able to generate more interest in creative
and visual art. Luckily, the people at the Ariel are
willing to help students who are reluctant to see
their work published.

In order to promote the number of submissions
it is getting, the Ariel is working to publish more
than one issue this year. Susan Deutsch, editor of
the Ariel, said this should boost involvement.

“A lot of people want to get stuff into theAriel,
but they don’t think about doing it until after the
magazine has come out. Hopefully, if we publish

twice a year, we’ll get more material to print,”-

she said.

Due to a limited budget, each issue will prob-
ably contain fewer pages. Deutsch wants to even-
tually see the Ariel published three times a year,
something which will happen only if interest in the
magazine picks up.

The Ariel is also attempting to co-sponsor po-
etry readings with the Washington and Lee Society
for the Arts. Students who are interested in poetry
will be able to have poets in the area read their
work, much the same way they can hear musicians
come to play at the Lenfest Center. This, in turn,
may inspire student poets to write for the Ariel.

In the past, the magazine received entries mostly
from English majors who had more contact with
the Ariel. Other students who may not have the
same opportunities to express themselves are en-
couraged to write entries.

So, if you can draw, paint, take pictures or write
(something students at Washington and Lee are
doubtless experts are doing), consider getting your
work into the next issue of theAriel. The first issue
this year should be coming out sometime
in January.

Underwater Monopoly, anyone?

Washington and Lee upperclassmen
might be unfamiliar with the game, played
with weighted boardpieces in a swimming
pool. But an applicant for this year’s Fresh-
man Leadership Council suggested it as an
activity to promote class unity.

The FLC is already abuzz with such ideas
after its first meeting two weeks ago.

The first FLC formed two years ago to
unite the freshman class through recreational
activities and service projects. This year,
Dean of Freshmen Dennis Manning and
Dean of Student Activities Michelle
Richardson chose eight permanent council
members and two alternates from among
40 applicants.

“The ones that we chose were a lot more
motivated and excited than the others,” said
Richardson. She and Manning wanted a
group that would “land running”
once elected.

At their meeting with the deans, FLC

members suggested class picnics, trips, com-
munity service projects, and even a “Fresh-
man Weekend” in October.

But they focused mainly on their first
task: making Old George sit pretty as a yel-
low jacket exterminator on their class ﬂoat
for homecoming. ‘

The F LC’s next project, Freshman Week-
end, will take place during Reading Days,
October20-23. Council member Matt Graves
said the weekend should be full of activities.

“We’re looking at some inter-hall compe-
titions like tug-of-war, another movie night
like we had for orientation...pizza parties and
stuff like that,” said Graves.

Council member Kendall Cruickshanks
said the council also discussed organizing a
freshman cheering section at the last home
football game that weekend.

“Mike Walsh, the athletic director,
wants (us) to promote school spirit,”
Cruickshanks said.

Richardson said she likes these ideas and
will encourage the council to act on others,
as well.

Even those that have gathered a little~dust
over the years.

“One of (the council members) wanted to 
do a recycling project,” Richardson said. “It ;

was kind of like re-inventing the wheel.”

Richardson said the F LC should sponsor
the project despite problems other groups
have had in initiating a recycling program in
the past. I

“Any events that are planned, I think that
they’re destined to be a success, because it’s‘
like new ground,” said Richardson.

Both the deans and council members said
camaraderie has already turned their ideas
into reality.

“Everything’s seemed to click,” said
Cruickshanks. “We work well together.”

Cruickshanks said Richardson has also
had a positive influence on the FLC.

Richardson became dean of student activities; I
this year after spending two years working’ 7.

with student councils in New York.

Her first project this year was organizingi ‘
the acoustic coffee house nights in the Gen-' T

eral Headquarters.
“She ’s real

“She’s had a lot of great ideas and has I

reinforced our ideas.”

Marcus Garvey sparked a Back to Africa movement in
the 1920’s with his Universal Negro Improvement Associa-
tion. Today, Afrocentric thought and the celebration of
Kwanzaa paints Africa as a source of racial pride. But what
is Africa.

Eddy L. Harris, author of Native Stranger, takes us
through a sometimes hopeful and oftentimes painful jour-
ney through Africa.

Harris makes it clear from the beginning that he is not
Alex Haley trying to discover his roots: “Because my skin
is black you will say I traveled Africa to find the roots of my
race.

I did not—unless that race is the human race, for except
in the color of my skin, I am not African.” I happen to agree.
I do not speak Swahili, Wolof, Mandinka, or any other
African language. I speak English, some Spanish, and a little
(very little) Latin. I am an American. Fine. Point made.
Harris, however, feels the need to repeatedly show how
unAfrican he is. It becomes a little strained and extremely
tiring.

The strength lies in its lyrical descriptions of the African
continent. He starts in Paris and moves through Tunisia,

Ivory Coast, Zimbabwe, Zaire, South Africa, and other
countries.

He sees the poverty and the ravages of colonialism. He
bristles at the excesses and corruption of African elites.
When he goes to the Ivory Coast, he shakes his head at the
waste of a beautiful church.

“Felix Houphouet-Boigny builds a massive Catholic
basilica in the jungle of a nation of people the vast majority
of who are animists...Houphouet—Boigny says it is a monu-
ment to his people. But it is a monument to himself.”

African elites like any politician surrounds himself with

lavish things. It gives him power. It also gives them the -

temptation to abuse that power.

He visits the Gambia where Haley searched for his
ancestors. He stands at the slave stations where Africans
were held before they made the ominous Middle Passage.
How did they feel? What were their lives like before? These
questions fill Harris’ mind as he looks around. He spends
time in a Liberia jail cell. Liberia was founded in the late
19th century by American slaves.

Unfortunately, these slaves oppressed the indigenous
peoples there.

He faces the bitterness of Africans toward American
imperialism and neglect; it matters not that he is black——he
is still a fascist American in their eyes. In Mali, he receives
an indication of his wonderful country-’s policy toward
Africa.

“You send us aid not to help us develop, but to appease
your conscience, and the aid gets corrupted...It is good will,
but not much more. And always we are forced to look upon
to white men who seem to know more about everything than

that Heart‘  Africa i_

we do. It is another form of imperialism.”
Harris knows he is also a part of this imperialism.

Harris has an eloquent voice. He is brutally honest, which
gives the book its true power. His carefully drawn observa-
tions and frank opinions keeps the reader engrossed. His
weakness comes when he continually reminds the reader
that he is not African. When he is in South Africa, he admits
that he sometimes has more in common with the Boer than
the African.

Dr/'v/n ' N’ Cryin ’shaR<:s Pavilion

By KELLEY TA’I'l‘EN
Phi Staff Writer

Performing at the Pavillon Friday night, Drivin’ N’
Cryin’ brought their act to W&L’s homecoming festivities.

The Atlanta-based band played both new and old songs
for an enthusiatic audience. “The songs from their older
albums were definately the crowd pleasers,” observed Kate
Giese.

DNC introduced their musical style to the W&L crowd. In
contrast to their earlier works, DNC has mellowed a bit.
They seem to have wandered away from the edgy, college
grunge genre and created a more distinct, characterizing
sound. This change brought a new personality to DNC’s old,
familiar tunes. '

“Their performances of Fly Me Courageous and Gain?
Straight to Hell were my favorites because I knew all the
words and I could sing along,” recalls Margaret Rich.

Due to DNC’s popularity, particularly in the south, many
W&L students looked forward with great anticipation to the
concert. After missing out on a recent show in Atlanta,
Shelli Henderson welcomed DNC to the stage: “A couple of
weeks before I left for school, I was supposed to see them at
a Flood Relief concert. I ended up trapped inside my house
because of a ﬂash ﬂood, so this was a great opportunity to
make it up.”

The band impressed some concertgoers unfamiliar with
their music. Bligh Wollner commented, “I liked them better
live than when I heard their cd.” Some happy audience
members even crowd surfed- a sure sign of their approval.
Tiffany Gagliardi summed the night’s entertainment up by
simply stating, ‘‘It was rockin’!”

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

 

. Costs of W&L Revealed

Washington and Lee has managed to keep its tuition
costs down over the years, but at what price? My
depression of the last few days for having my wallet
stolen on campus has recently shifted to anger as the
costs of replacing its contents has become apparent. I
only had twenty dollars in the $12 wallet/key chain, so
besides losing that $32, I initially thought my only
other losses would be the time it took me to replace my
driver’s license, credit cards, etc. Little did I know.

A trip to Taco Hall soon conﬁrmed that I would be
charged $ 10 for the replacement of my university card.
I had never lost a card before, and I suppose I had
expected the university to be understanding about the
theft. No such luck: that little piece of white plastic
with a xeroxed image (which was already in the
computer!) does indeed cost $10.

Not only did I pay $10 for the card, but I was
informed that the $20 I had just (the day before) added
to my vending account could not be recovered. Amazed,
I realized that I can get a new credit line with a $5000
credit line for free by making a simple two minute
‘phone call, but I have to pay $30 to get a university
card! My costs of having my wallet stolen had now
escalated to $62, in addition to the mental aggravation
of trying to replace everything.
Now, my post office key cost exactly $1 to replace,
inclusive of any taxes or fees. Why is it then that my
university keys cost $25 each to replace? Security
reasons, they say. They don’t want people to dissemi-
nate keys to their friends. Well, lets talk about secu-
rity. Lets talk about theft in campus buildings and
why the security office has never posted any informa-
tion about crime on campus. I would like to see student
body notices from Mike Young hanging from every
bulletin board detailing each month’s thefts-—perhaps
:then those of us lulled into a false sense of security by
.our honor code will wake up and realize that Lexing-
ton is not immune to the problems of larger cities. How
many bicycles were stolen last year? How many CD’s
have been stolen from people’s rooms? How much
vandalism has there been to people’s dorm rooms? I
«know that there has been some. but the more I ask
people the more I find that almost everybody on
campus has had something of value stolen in the last
year.

So now my wallet will cost $112, and all for the $20
cash that was enclosed. But now I’ve started thinking
about other costs of the university that just are not
included in tuition. $15 chemistry lab fee. $10 class
dues. $15 Calyx photo fee. $25 parking fee. $25 park-
ing ticket. $3/week laundry. Phone bills. Refrigerator
rental. Room damage fees. Gym class fees ($36 ice
skating, almost $70 canoeing). The Co-op makes some
outrageous profit, like 30% on all food items. And
anybody who has ever bought a paperback in the
bookstore for $40 knows that the pricing there is
obscene.

It really adds up after a while. No, college isn’t
cheap, and a lot of the money doesn’t seem to be going
towards my education.

The Ring-tum Phi, October 7, 1994

      
  

Drug penalties cause crowding

Recently, college, campuses, includ-
ing Washington and Lee, have wit-
nessed a resurgence of casual drug use.
The trend appears to be promoted by,
although not limited to, a false aware-
ness that recreational drugs, marijuana
in particular, have
somehow ac-

imprisonment without possibility of
parole.

Other legendary sentences have oc-
curred, particularly in Oklahoma.In
1992 Jim Montgomery, :1 paraplegic
who smoked marijuana to relieve

muscle spasms
was arrested in

quired a decrimi-
nalized status.
However, ‘reefer
madness’ laws are
stronger than ever.
Consider the case
of Mark Young.
In May of 1991
Young, the target
of a Drug Enforce-

 

Sayre, Okla-
homa,whensher-
iffs discovered
two ounces of
marijuana in his
w h e e l c h a i r
pouch. Mont-
gomery was then
tried and con-
victed, by jury,

'95

ment Administra-
tion sting opera-
tion, was arrested at his Indianapolis
home for negotiating the sale of 700
pounds of marijuana. However,
Young’s sole involvement as the al-
leged middleman in the transaction was
to introduce the owners of the cannabis
saliva farm to prospective marijuana
buyers from New York. In fact there
was never a formal introduction but
rather, Young suggested to a friend,
with whom he was sharing a joint with
on a Florida ﬁshing trip, where he
could obtain dope of similar quality.
Despite the seemingly innocuous sug-
gestion, Young was charged with “con-
spiracy to manufacture” marijuana and
was, consequently, liable for all 12,500
marijuana plants grown on Claude
Atkinson’s and Ernest Montgomery's
Morgan County farm. Young was, sub-
sequently, convicted solely on the tes-
timony of Atkinson and Montgomery,
despite the fact that no confiscated
marijuana, money, or any other physi-
cal evidence connected Young to the
illegal transaction. On February 8, 1992,
Indiana Federal judge Sarah Evans
Barker sentenced Mark Young to life

for possession of
marijuana with

the intent to distribute as well as pos-
session of unlawful paraphernalia. His
sentence? life in prison plus sixteen
years.

Perhaps even more incredible, the
1994 arrest and conviction of the former
petty thief, l..arry Jackson. While being
arrested in a friend’s Tulsa apartment
for a non-violent offense, police offic-
ers noted traces of marijuana residue
nearJackson’sfeet.Theresidue inques-
tion, was later measured as 0.16 of a
gram, which is 0.005644 of an ounce.
Jackson, like Montgomery, was given

_ a life sentence without parole.

In 1986, the passage of the Anti-
Drug Abuse Act, radically altered the
power of the federal judge to determine
sentences for convicted drug offend-
ers. Formerly, federal judges, after re-
viewing the particulars of a case could,
under review of extenuating circum-
stances, reduce or probate the sentence
of a convicted drug offender. How-
ever, zero tolerance sentencing guide-
lines enacted in 1987 by the Sentenc-
ing Reform Act of 1984, have given
prosecuting U.S. attorneys and not the

judges, the sole authority to determine
whether or not mandatory minimums
apply to a particular case. Furthermore,
U.S. attorneys are encouraged by the
Thomburgh Memorandum, which is
included in all hand books issued to
U.S. attorneys, to pursue the maximum
penalty in all drug related offenses,
“regardless of any mitigating circum-
stances.” Consequently, federal pros-
ecutors unnecessarily ﬁll court dock-
ets and more importantly, ﬁll federal
prisons with non-violent drug offend-

population.

The nation’s prison populations
have doubled since 1970 and drug of-
fenders alone are now numerically
greater than the total prison population
in 1970. As a result, the United States
has the dubious distinction of main-
taining the highest rate of its own citi-
zens in the world.

Perhaps decriminalization of drugs
will end our modern Prohibition and
return hard core criminals, not non-
violent substance abusers, to prison.

Mandatory minimums have resulted
in the explosion of the federal prison
population. In 1970, 16.3 percent of all
federal prisoners were drug offenders.
Presently, the United States incarcer-
ates 200,00 federal drug offenders com-
prising sixty tow percent of the penal

violent drug offenders. Abolishing fed-

discovered an item that has been bumin ’

“They’ve sold right well,” said the

liking was for beautiful trucks.

Once again: They’re back for a new week

BY TORY Noro AND JASON TEETERS
Phi Staff Writers

Since the National Hockey League is still dormant,
we’ll continue to discuss the gridiron. Week #5 was
included many an upset, as the salary—capped NFL
showed its parity.

The biggest embarrassment of the weekend belonged
to the 49ers as they were levelled by the high-ﬂying
Birds of Philly. When the 49ers entered Candlestick on
Sunday afternoon, they weren’t prepared for the shocker
they would receive. -

Rookie Charlie Garner, Calvin Williams, and the
punishing Mean Green Defense ran rough-shod overthe
high price 49ers. Deion Sanders and Jerry Rice were
rendered non-factors by the spirited ones from the City
of Brotherly Love, as the Eagles rolled on to win 40-8
over the hapless 49ers.

The New Jersey Giants came into the weekend as
one-half of the two undefeated teams left in the league.
Much to the chagrin of their loyal fans, Pro-Bowl
running back Rodney Hampton’s absence was all too
evident as the Aint’s of the Bayou pulled out an ugly
victory over the Big Blue Wrecking Crew.

Dave Brown showed a lot of poise in the pocket. He
and the Giants look to get back on the winning track this
coming Monday night against the Vikings in Jimmy
Hoffa’s mausoleum, Giants Stadium.

Buddy-Ball is back! The St. Louis -oops- Arizona
Cardinals ﬂew by the Minnesota Vikings. The patented
“46 Defense” shot the Moon and company in Buddy
Ryan’s first victory of the season.

Once again, Washington proved that they are never
accused of being a good football team. Heath Shuler’s
first start as QB did not have the makings of a memo-
rable experience.

K

L

\

Switzer’s Cowboys lassoed the Skin’s attack. Unfor-
tunately for the Skins, the DC Defense did not pick up the
slack.

After reaching an emotional high by winning the
Battle of the Bays, the Pack Attack was no match for
Bledsoe’s aerial onslaught. Parcells’ Patriots and his
traditionally strong defense eeked out a victory with the
help of Green Bay’s obligatory choke.

The “Showdown of the Shulas” gave Don bragging
rights at family reunions as Dan Marino continued on his
impressive season with two TD passes over the inept and
winless Cincinnati Bungles.

The Buffalo stampede was stopped by the Grizzlies of
Chicago as Thurman Thomas’s absence proved costly.

The Jets ﬂight was aborted before takeoff as they were
chewed apart by the Dawgs of Cleveland.

In a new discussion, we’re going to mention college
football. Saturday is a big day for college contests. In a
rematch of one of last year’s most exciting games the
Fightin’ Irish of Notre Dame look to avenge their costly
loss to the Boston College Eagles, thereby settling the
argument of who’s side God is really on.

This years strongest team, the Penn State Nittany
Lions, led by exciting running back Ki-Jana Carter plan
their method of pummeling the Michigan Wolverines
during their current off week.

This week’s other main attraction involves two Flo-
ridian teams vying for bragging rights in the Sunshine
state. Florida State’s title hopes rest on their ability to
defeat their nemesis on their home turf, in Miami.

Defensive lineman Warren Sapp will lead the Hurri-
cane defense in an attempt to stonn over the perennially
strong offensive attack of the Seminoles led by Danny
Kannell.

We’ll be back next week and hopefully our article will
have in-depth discussion of the ’95 NHL season. In the
meantime start ordering your Roanoke Express season

Water Polo squad gathers steam heading

By STEPHEN WILLIARD
Phi Sports Editor

After a season of heartbreak-
ing losses, the Washington and
Lee water polo team was aiming
to turn the tables last weekend.

The Generals did just that,
winning two of three at the Rich-
mond Eastern Water Polo Asso-
ciation Tournament.

The two wins carrre against
11th ranked Bucknell and regu-
lar power Johns Hopkins.

Just the weekend before, the
Generals had succumbed to
Bucknell in the ﬁnal twenty sec-
onds of the contest.

There was no repeat this past
weekend as the Generals sent the
game into overtime.

In the overtime, W&L domi-
nated going up by four goals be-
fore a two point shot cut the ﬁnal
score to 20-18.

Sophomore Pete Sorenson
tallied three goals in the over-
time period and goalie David
Silvester notched 21 saves for
the game as the Generals made
their present felt with the upset.

“Itwasabig win,” said sopho-
more James Silberstein,“lt’s deﬁ-
nitely been a big turning point for

the team.”

In the second game, Johns
Hopkins fell to the W&L on-
slaught, going down 12-10 be-
hind four goals by Silberstein.

According to coach Paige
Remillard, the win against Johns
Hopkins was just as important
because it affected the Division
III rankings

The third game saw the Gen-
erals fall to the University of
Richmond 10-4.

Silvester partly attributed the
loss to fatigue, “This team is not
as deep as it has been in the past.”

Remillard added that the team
had taken a long break between
games and, “was fat-happy and
got mauled by Richmond at
home.”

The Generals’ coach was
quick to add, however, that the
game was extremely close
through the ﬁrst half with Rich-
mond ahead 3-1.

Some controversy was cre-
ated by the questionable water
quality of the Richmond pool.

“Our guys most noticeably
had a lot of eye problems,” said
Remillard.

The Richmond players, how-
ever, began to develop brachial
problems during the week as a

result of increased chlorine lev-

els in and around the pool.
Despite the problems, the

Generals are still scheduled to

' take on the Spiders twice this

weekend with the ﬁrst game be-
ing played tonight at Twombly
Pool in the Warner Center and
the second game scheduled for
tomorrow at Richmond.

Silberstein echoed the senti-
ments of the team, saying, “We’re
deﬁnitely ready for this week-
end,” as the Generals prepare for
their rivals.

When asked about what the
team needs to do to close out the
season successfully, Remillard
said, “We need to learn how to
come out third quarter against
our opponents and really get it
rolling,” ,

The upcoming game this
weekend is expected to draw the
biggest crowd of the year for the
Generals.

Remillard voiced conﬁdence
in this weekend’s series against
the Spiders, “If we don’t win it,
it’ll go down to the last second,
but we’re going to win it.”

Silvester asserted the enthu-
siasm of the squad, saying sim-
ply, “We hope everyone will
come out.”

Football falls to Randolph Macon

Washington and Lee's football team dropped to 0-3 after a 19-0 loss to
Randolph Macon in the Generals’ homecoming game. The W&L defense
held the yellow jackets to just two offensive touchdowns, one of which was
scored late in the fourth quarter.

Women kickers continue strong

BY JOSHUA HESLINGA
Phi Staff Writer

The next time anyone tells
you that freshmen aren’t worth
having around, I have two words
for you to tell them: Erica
Reineke.

This freshman from West
Bloomﬁeld, MI, played a key
role by scoring two goals in last
Thursday’s 7-0 whitewashing of
Mary Baldwin, broke the single-
season Washington and Lee
points record with a late go-ahead
goal in the tough overtime loss to
Randolph-Macon this past Sat-
urday, and tied the W&L single-
season goal record with her 10th
in the Generals’ win over Sweet
Briar Wednesday.

When asked about her incred-
ible achievements, Reineke said,
“I’m having such a great time.
it’s so awesome to come to this
school where everyone isso good.
It makes you feel conﬁdent with
them behind you, and it’s nice to
feel that they need me too.”

What are her pre-game ritu-
als? Although she refused to di-
vulge the exact contents of the
tape, Reineke replied, “I have
some music I listen to that gets
me pumped up. I also try to visu-
alize scoring a goal or doing
something I want to work on.”

As for the games, the team
faced Mary Baldwin College last
Thursday in what was widely
viewed as a tune-up for
Saturday’s game against
Randolph-Macon. They made it
look like just that, scoring all
seven goals in the ﬁrst half to put
Mary Baldwin away early.

When asked if the emphasis
on preparation earlier in the week
made a difference, Coach Jan
Hathom replied, “Yes, we stayed
very focused and we did the
things we wanted to do. They’re
also young and inexperienced,
and that helped a lot.”

Due to the absence of starting
sophomore goalie Beth Mozena,
freshman Delia Coyle ﬁlled in
and recorded the shutout.

After the game, she
downplayed any nervousness in
the move to goalie, saying, “They
didn’t give us a lot of pressure,
otherwise I think I would have
been real nervous.”

Next came the perennial pow-
erhouse Randolph-Macon. Al-
though the visitors seemed to
control the ﬂow early, sopho-
more Michelle Bauman and jun-
ior Sara Benson each scored to
keep the game tied at 2-2 going
into the ﬁnal ten minutes.

Fab freshman Erica Reineke
then put the Generals ahead 3-2,
but with a bare 2:41 left,
Randolph Macon beat goalie
Beth Mozena in her return from a
back injury to tie the game.

Overtime proved to be all
Randolph-Macon, as they scored
a goal in each quarter to record
the ﬁnal 5-3 score.

Coach Hathorn sounded a
mixed note when asked about the
loss, saying, “I’m very happy
with it [the game]. That’s not to
say we shouldn’t have won, but
regardless of the outcome, the
majority of things that happened
Saturday were very positive.”

When asked if fatigue played
a role in the ﬁnal tally, Coach

Hathom replied, “From looking
at it over and over, it’s probably
fatigue. People were just two
steps behind, not because they
weren’t trying, but because they
just couldn’t ﬁnd it in the last two
minutes. There were also some
mistakes on the defensive end;
we’re a very young team.”

When asked the same ques-
tion, Reineke cited tiredness but
also a push by Randolph-Macon,
saying, “We were really tired,
but they just came out really hard
at us. They got a lucky goal at the
end of regulation and that kind of
set us back for a little while.”

The Generals then faced
Sweet Briar on Wednesday, and
Coach Hathorn sounded a cau-
tionary note before the game,
saying, “Sweet Briar always
treats us as a big game and are
always up for us, so it’s a tricky
situation.”

Her remarks proved to be
overly cautious as the Generals
won an easy 5-1 victory. Besides
the goal by Reineke, senior Kait
Barton scored two goals in the
winning effort, and senior Anne
Spruill also recorded one goal.

The week’s results put the
women’s soccer team at 5-3 with
ﬁve games remaining.

Coach Hathom shed a posi-
tivelightonthe upcoming games,
saying, “Our team knows that
they need to win the rest of their
conference games, and I feel very
strongly that they will come out
and take care of business.”

As for Reineke, she doesn’t
plan to let up, adding, “I just
want to keep on scoring and help-
ing my team.”

Buddy McGirt should take les-
sons from the Washington & Lee
women’s cross-country team.

Last Saturday, the welterweight
challenger thought he could take
the title away from champion
Pernell Whitaker in Whitaker’s
hometown of Norfolk. McGirt got
whipped.

Earlier that day,W&L traveled
to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for the
Franklin & Marshall Invitational.
McGirt should have been watch-
mg.
The Generals left town having
humiliated the ﬁeld, shattered the
course record, and claimed more
than half of the individual honors
awarded. They came, they
saw...you know the rest.

With six of the top seven ﬁn-
ishers, Washington & Lee won the
seven-team meet with 19 points.
Susquehanna and host F&M tied
for second with 80.

The race was so lopsided that
the Generals could have split their
squad evenly and claimed both
ﬁrst and second.

Head coach Jim Phemister said
it was clear ahead of time that the
Generals were going to win, and

re was pleased to see that his run-
rers did not let up.

His runners apparently did not
hink the win was going to be that
my.

“We knew there was a possi-

dominates at ain

ility [we’d win big],” saidjun-
ior Amy Mears, “but we really
didn’t expect it to be that easy.”

Junior Josephine Schaeffer
picked up her fourth win in four
meets this year with a course
record 17:58, a minute and 35
seconds under the old mark.
Her nearest competitor, F&M’s
Jamie Kendig (19:03) would
have busted the course record
herself, had she not had
Schaeffer to deal with.

The old record of 19:33 was
set in 1990 by Swarthmore’s
DanaBailey.

Schaeffer has now won 20
of her 23 career races.

Mears placed third in 19:38
and was the ﬁrst of ﬁve con-
secutive Generals to cross the
line, all under 21 minutes.
Freshman Maren Wright ran a
personal best 20:03 for fourth
place and was followed by
classmate Carson Flowers, se-
nior captain Kim Herring and
senior Sue Deutsch.

Sophomore Nat Messmore
ran her best collegiate time for
a ninth place ﬁnish and senior
Teresa Lamey crossed in 13th,
giving W&L eight ofthe top 15
ﬁnishers, all of whom received
awards.

The only other schools rep-
resented in the ﬁrst 15 were
F&M (3), Susquehanna (3), and
Salisbury State (1).

For Lamey, the meet was
her best of a comeback season.
Last year, an injury forced her

out of action for e second half
of the season.
This weekend, more of the
same whipping ought to be fea-
tured at the W&L Invitational.
Washington & Lee hosts a ﬁeld
of mostly conference opponents

and another easy victory for the

I nation’s number-20 Division III

team is expected.

“We’re approaching it with
the same attitude as always,” said
Herring. “We’re just lucky that
everyone is running well and
everyone’s healthy.”

The meet will be the Gener-
als’ ﬁnal tune-up before next
week’s State Division II-III
Championship at Newport News.
W&L has won the last two state
titles and the team is looking for-
ward to this one.

“We’re excited to have a meet
where we’ll get to run against
some good teams,” said Herring.
“Everyone is focused and, at the
same time, is having fun.”

The Generals’ chances of re-
peating appear good, since they
are in the midst of the program’s
best year ever. The women have
beaten 34 of the 35 s :hools they
have faced so far, with the only
loss coming to the University of
Virginia.

A year ago, W&L’s state
championship squad lost to 10 of
their ﬁrst 35 opponents.

Drivin n’ Cryin to play Pavilion

By JENNIFER [ATHAM
Phi Staff Writer

In the interest of his business,
Wayne Raynal requested that his
name not be used in connection
with Night Owl (he’s the owner).

Washington and Lee students
hope to hear blasts from the past
when Drivin’ n‘ Cryin’ plays at the
Pavilion tonight.

”Their musical style has really
changed a lot,” said Drew Denbo,
S.A.B. entertainment director.

“lt’s gotten a little bit harder.
I don’t know if they were just
experimenting, but I’m hoping
they’ll go back to their old style
and tone it down.”Students’ pref-
erence for early DNC work shows
in album sales at Night Owl
Records.

“Mystery Road” is the band’s
oldest album and the top seller at
Night Owl, followed by “Whisper
Tames the Lion” and “Scarred but

Smarter.””Mystery Road” gained
recognition especially because of
the single “Straight to Hell.”

"I think I ﬁrst heard it at a
fraternity party,” said Senior Dasha
Hermosilia. “It’s very sing
along.”Lexington resident and
“’70s survivor” Wayne Raynal said
DNC might have been considered
a metal band like Deep Purple and
Led Zeppelin if they had been
around in the ’70s.

”It’s mellow compared to what
we used to call metal,” said
Raymal.

“They don’t call it that any-
more. It’s just hard rock.”Drivin’
and Cryin’ made a turn toward
metal in 1993 with the release of
the album “Smoke.”

Since then, the band has
changed from Island Records to
Geffen. DNC also dropped their
fourth guitarist and added organist
Joey Huffman after “Smoke” came
out.

They plan to take their new
sound to L.A. in October to record

an album after touring.If the con-
cert turnout at W&L is any indica-
tion of their tour’s success, DNC
will be on a roll when they get to
L.A. As of Thursday afternoon,
about 150 tickets had been sold at
W&L.

Junior Pete Jalbert, S.A.B.
ticket coordinator, said sales
“should be comparable” to those
of last year’s homecoming con-
cert.

”We’re pretty optimistic about
attendance,” said Jalbert.DNC’s
opening band, Freeway, might
boost attendance with their fol-
lowers. Freeway will also play in
Dave Matthews’ upcoming tour
and has opened up for Widespread
Panic and Allgood.

The Knoxville band formed
three years ago and recently re-
corded a soon to be released
CD.Ticket sales for the concert
will continue Friday in front of the
Co—op. They will be $8 in advance
and $10 at the door. Freeway will
start the show at 8:30 p.m.

(parade enters  year

By CINDY YOUNG
Phi Staff Writer

Washington and Lee’s Third
Annual Homecoming Parade will
be one of many highlights of
theSept. 30 - Oct. 1 weekend. On
Saturday, Oct. 1, the 11:30 a.m.
parade will originate at Brewbaker
Field making its way down Main
Street and turning left onto Wash-
ington Street.

The idea for reviving the W&L
tradition came from the leaders of
Kathekon, W&L’s student alumni
group. Each participating student
group wil construct a ﬂoat repre-
senting their respective organiza-
tion or the depiction of a Generals’
victory over the Randolph-
Macon”Yellow Jackets.” Other
groups invited to participate in the
parade include the Lylbum Down-
ing Middle School Band, the
Rockbridge County High School
Band, area fire departments and
rescue teams, the Liberty Hall
Volunteers, and local elected offi-
cials. The trophy for the best float
is a three-foot stuffed mink on a
walnut and brass base.

In additiontothe Homecoming
parade, other activities will include
the football game on Saturday af-
ternoon, alumni receptions, con-
certs, and lectures. Also, a confer-
ence for Alumni Chapter Presi-

dents will continue through the
weekend.

Two reunion groupswill gather
on campus Homecoming week-
end. the “Five Star Generals,”
alumni who graduated from W&L
50 or more years ago, will be hon-
ored at a dinner in Evans Dining
Hall on Friday evening. Members
of the four most recently gradu-
ated classes will also gather for a
“Cluster Reunion,” a program that
was initiated six years ago to give
the younger alumni an opportu-
nity to come together on campus
prior to the five-year spring re-
union.

Friday’s activities will include

a reception for alumni at 6 p.m. in
the W&L Alumni House. At 8:45
p.m., the W&L choral ensembels
including Southern Comfort and
JubiLee will give a concert in the
Lenfest Center’s Keller Theater.
Activities continue Saturday
morning with the 11:30 a.m. pa-
rade in downtown Lexington.

An alumni luncheon on the
Front Lawn will be held at 12
noon. At 2 p.m. the football team
will go against Randolph-Macon
on Wilson Field, with the half-
time crowning of the Homecom-
ing queen. A post-game reception
will be held at the W&L Alumni
House.

’51 Homecoming

W&L finally beat the Wahoos
in historic homecoming game

By Kenn GRANT
Phi Staff Writer

Every Homecoming ought to
be this big. The Generals, the
Wahoos.

Two of the biggest interstate
rivals in the nation.

Of the first 22 times Washing-
ton & Lee and Virginia met on the
football field since 1890, W&L
won ten, the Cavaliers took eleven,
and one game was a tie.

That, however, was how the
series stood 14 years earlier, be-
fore Virginia ran off nine succes-
sive wins over the Generals.

In 1951, the W&L faithful felt
for sure that streak was going to
end.

This would be the year.

For the 1951 Generals, few
hopes abounded of repeating the
previous year’s number 18 rank-
ing and Gator Bowl berth.

Hopes for a repeat Southern
Conference title ended with a home
54-14 loss to Maryland in the sec-
ond week.

What was left to hope for?

After all, Walt Michaels, the
best football playerthe school ever
saw, was now doing his work on
NFL ﬁelds.

Yet, the backfield still had
Bocetti. Quarterback Gil Bocetti,
the best football player in the state.

That alone was reason enough
to believe that this would be the
year.

There would be no run at a
national championship, nor an-
other bowl game.

But 1951 just might be, just
could be the year W&L would
beat those dang Wahoos.

Homecoming ’51 had all the
hype.

Virginia had beaten W&L with
a late score the previous year, and
the Generals were looking to re-
pay the favorby blocking the Cavs’
road to their first unbeaten season
since 1908.

It would be the first time the
hated Cavs would visit Wilson
Field in three years.

To accommodate the large
crowds that usually turned out to
follow the Blue and White, W&L
played many games each season at
neutral sites, like Richmond,
Roanoke and Lynchburg.

Though it may be hard for
today’s W&L football rooters to
comprehend, Wilson Field simply
wasn’t big enough for their fans.

Finally, as in any great battle,
there was the gratuitous one-on-
one duel to watch.

Bocetti and Virginia QB Rufus
Barkley, considered two of the best
split-T quarterbacks, would face
eachother for the last time.

Through two games, Virginia
had yet to be scored upon, heating
George Washington and Virginia
Tech by a combined 53-0.

Barkley had completed 20 of
33 passes in the two games for 183
yards.

The Generals, though set-back
by Maryland two weeks earlier,
were coming off of a 34-0 rout of
favored West Virginia.

In the week leading up to the
showdown, the Virginia press had
every reason to give W&L a
chance.

Bocetti had missed most of the
Maryland game with a leg injury,
but was now healthy.

As the Richmond Times-Dis-
patch reported four days before
the game, the Generals quarter-
back had the ability to lift his team
to new heights:

“Without Bocetti, Washington
& Lee is just another team; with
Bo at quarterback, the Generals
are a scoring threat each time they
go on the offensive.”

The day of the game, the Times- I

Dispatch favored the Cavaliers in
what they said would be a “clas-
s1c.”

Yet, the paper noted “W&L is
primed for the game, its front-line
men are in good shape, and the
Blue supporters are banking on
another scintillating performance
by Bocetti to turn the trick.”

At the long anticipated kick-
off, 10,000 fans were jammed
intoWilson Field to see if W&L
could become the ﬁrst Virginia
school since 1946 to top the Wa-
hoos.

Ten minutes into the game, the
Blue & White scored the ﬁrst points
the Virginia defensive eleven had
allowed all season.

A nine-yard touchdown pass
from Bocetti to Bob Thomas and
Jay Handlan’s extra-point gave
W&L a 7-0 lead.

The lead lasted but a few sec-
onds as the Cavs’ Jim Ashwell
raced the ensuing kickoff back
untouched for a 95-yard score, ty-
ing the game.

But before the first quarter could
end, Bocetti’s Generals had gone
ahead once again.

The W&L QB connected with
Thomas on a 34-yard touchdown
pass for a lead the Generals would
never relinquish. In the second
quarter, the Generals defense in-
tercepted a Barkley pass in Vir-
ginia territory.

Three plays later, Thomas took
an end around into the endzone for
his third TD.

When Randy Browles bounded
77 yards for another W&L touch-
down minutes later, the Cavaliers
were clearly ﬁnished.

When the dust settled on Wil-
son Field, the inspired Generals
had trounced their rivals 42-14.

Not since Richmond did it ﬁve
years before had a Virginia school
beaten UVA.

“I thought it would be a close
game which could go either way,”
head coach7George Barclay said
afterwards.

“I never dreamed we would
get 42 points.”

The W&L defense had held
Barkley to one of seven passing
for just seven yards! Bocetti, mean-
while, picked up 122 passing yards
on six of 13.

The running game, which
Barclay said beforehand would be
secondary in their offensive plans,
gained 358 yards.

The stunning rout proved to be
the lone blemish on Virginia’s
record. The Generals had their re-
venge.

“Bocetti-Thomas Combina-
tion Stuns Virginia for W&L,”
screamed the Times-Dispatch
headline.

“Virginia Halted,”saidthe New
York Times.

The Ring-tum Phi, though, said
it all: “We finally beat the Wa-
hoos!”

 Coeducation Report finished

Non-discriminatory admissions recommended

By MICHAEL HEWLEIT
Phi Staff Writer

The Coeducation Committee report is
ﬁnally completed, having concluded that
coeducation has helped the school, but a
continuation of the 60/40 male/female
ratio will hurt the school through
gender discrimination.

President John Wilson formed the com-
mittee to study whether the university pro-
videsacomfortableenvironmentforwomen.

Overall, the report found that coeduca-
tion has had a positive effect on the univer-
sity. Since W&Lwent coed in 1985, average
SAT scores have increased. The school has
become more selective in its admissions,
accepting only 30 percent of applicants.
Because of the 60/40 ratio, 75 percent of
female applicants are in the top 10 percent of
their class as compared to 50 percent
of males.

Wilson said the 60/40 ratio was instituted
as a transition from an all-male school to a
co-ed school.

“You need to have a little ﬂexibility and

avoid emotional terms such as discrimina-
tion,” said Wilson. “A certain amount of
intelligent guessing is necessary in dealing
with these matters.”

Co—chairman Professor Pam Simpson
agreed, but she said the transition is over.

“The next phase should be one where
there is greater balance,” she said.

The report also reveals the dominance of
fraternities in social activities. Simpson said

women have little power in planning social"

events. She said the same problem also ap-
plies to independent men.

“A lot of women feel like they’re guests
of the fraternities,” Simpson said.

Simpson said the committee recom-
mended that the university should continue
to encourage alternative social outlets.
Simpson said the committee also suggested
a new student center be considered. She said
she applauded the hiring of Student Activi-
ties Coordinator Michelle Richardson.

Simpson said the most disturbing aspect
of the report involves the alcohol survey. She
said it is a fact that W&L’s social interactions
tend to revolve around alcohol. An alcohol
survey was administered during SpringTerm

ciate that commitment.”

1993. (See related article, page 1)

Simpson said the committee studied how
women alumni have given to the Annual
Fund compared to men who have graduated
since 1989. The committee found that women
gave more money than men. Although more
men gave in the Capital Campaign, women
who did give donated more money than
the men.

The report also found that Commerce
School majors have dropped since Coeduca-
tion while the Humanities have increased.
English and Journalism are the most popular
majors of W&L females. Simpson said she
has no explanation for this phenomena.

Wilson said he was impressed by the
amount of information culled from different
aspects of the school. He said the report is
testimony to the progress theschool has made
during coeducation.

“We’ve come a long way in nine years, “
he said. “I don’t think there are any apologies
needed for the goals we’ve met.”

Simpson agreed.

“We really document a success story, “
she said, “but we also ﬁnd there are areas that
need attention.”

Alcohol Survey
released, shows

By DAN ODENWALD
Phi Staff Writer

“Work Hard ——- Play har .”

The unofficial motto of Wash-
ington and Lee University rings
truer than ever in the wake of the
release of the 1993 Alcohol Sur-

vey results. In fact, the report may
indicate students are playing ex-
tremely hard.

The results illustrated that al-

cohol plays a very large role in
campus life. When asked how
many times students had con-
sumed ﬁve to 10 drinks in one
drinking episode in the past year
(1992-1993), 53 percent of the
respondents answered over 10
times. 29 percent of those sur-
veyed admitted to drinking on
average six to nine drinks during
any given drinking period. 35 per-
cent of respondents said they had
passed out from drinking at least
once during the 1992-1993 aca-
demic year. Additionally, 35 per-
cent said they had suffered black-
outs or memory losses due to ex-
cessive drinking. Finally, 28 per-
cent had admitted to being a pas-
senger in a car with a driver who
was drunk.

There were clearly identiﬁable
patterns illustrated in the report.
For example, Greeks tended to
drink more than Independents, and
no distinction could be made
between varsity athletes
and non-athletes concerning
drinking patterns.

Results also show that male
students tended to drink more than
their female counterparts. The
report cited, “34.7 percent of
W&L males report that on big
party weekends they consume 15
drinks or more. Only 8.5 percent
of the females report alcohol con-
sumption at that level.”

The report also points out that
one in six students report having
been taken advantage of sexually
while under the inﬂuence. One in
every ﬁve students indicate they
have participated at least once in
unsafe sex as a result of drinking.
Also, one in ﬁve have admitted to
driving while drunk at least once.

Finally, 90 percent of W&L stu-
dents say they consume alcohol
regularly and consistently.
The North Carolina
Govemor’s Institute on Alcohol
and Substance Abuse, an inde-
pendent organization, visited
W&L in Spring Term of 1994
and attempted to “assess the role
of alcohol in the University com-
munity.” Among their observa-
tions was “alcohol use and abuse
is a strong tradition at Washing-
ton and Lee.” They also indi-

- cated, “Alumni attitudes toward

the support of a continuing,
strong drinking tradition appear
to be very strong.”

In accordance with their ob-
servations, the Govemor’s In-
stitute team provided the school
with a list of recommendations
in dealing with alcohol abuse.
Among these recommendations
were to require students involved
in alcohol related incidents or
arrests to receive substance
abuse evaluation by a trained
professional, to provide for a
substance abuse counselor, and
to increase teaching to students
about overall health mainte-
nance. They also urged the Presi-
dential Search Committee to
look for applicants with an ad-
equate awareness of alcohol
abuse on college campuses.
Advocating abstinence as a vi-
able option was also stressed in
the report. A widespread call
was made for education of dorm
counselors, resident advisors,
Greek leaders, athletic coaches,
and professors as to the signs of
alcohol addiction. Finally, the
Governor’s Institute promoted
the idea of support and educa-
tion groups for alcohol-
related issues.

Dean of Students David
Howison said, “The report con-
ﬁrmed my observation that al-
cohol abuse is the most serious
problem facing the students at
Washington and Lee.” He in-
tends to use the report “as a
basis for a review of alcohol” on
campus this year. Howison’s
major concerns are the exces-
sive use and abuse of alcohol

major abuses

by students.

“Extreme drunkenness, drink-
ing to get drunk, and the harmful
consequences,” according to
Howison, are the danger zones
that students need to avoid. None-
theless, he admits that alcohol
plays a dominant role in the life
of W&L students.

Alarming to Howison was
the younger ages at which young
people start drinking. In fact,
more than 75 percent of students
have begun drinking before they
reach college. He also points out
that there is an indirectly propor-
tional relationship between
academic achievement and
alcohol use.

“As drinking goes up, grades
go down,” said Howison.

Howison believes that the ad-
ministration cannot solve the

problem of alcohol on campus _

alone. In fact, he recognizes that
true change will come about only
when students are sufﬁciently
motivated enough to alter their
attitudes regarding drinking.

However, he did stress the
importance of, ﬁrst, admitting
W&L has an alcohol problem,
and second, developing strate-
gies to address this issue. Among
his suggestions are reviewing
some of the recommendations
made in the Governor’s
Institute’s report, especially those
of increased education and stu-
dent involvement.

Students also had opinions
about the release of the survey
results. Many offered their ideas
on why alcohol plays such a big
role on the W&L campus.

“Almost the entire social life
revolves around drinking,” says
senior Kristen Berg.

“Students won’t go anywhere
unless alcohol is present because
they feel like there is nothing else
to do.”

Freshman Andrew‘ Fullam
said he thought that students drink
excessively because “the work is
so hard and it’s a good release.”

Other students pointed out that
alcohol abuse is not unique

Upon reading the Princeton Review, a prospective stu-

In the same book, W&L appears as an idyllic, intellectual
haven boasting great faculty and facilities, a “country club”
home to a student body as homophobic as it is alcoholic. The
“work hard, play hard” creed of so many students manifests

Two other rankings, #18 in the category of Professors
Bring Material to Life and #18 in Professors Make Them-

W&L also ranked #5 in the Things Run Smoothly (best
administration) category. “Sitting in an administrative post,
this is heartening to hear,” said Dennis Manning, Dean of
Freshman and Residence Life.

One student disputed this ranking.

“I’m surprised at this,” said senior Ryan Boone. “Any-

U.S. sending more troops to Kuwait to
counter Iraqis

Despite Iraqi claims that it is withdrawing troops from the Kuwaiti
border, President Clinton said there are no signs of withdrawal and the U.S.
will continue to send forces to the Persian Gulf. The U.S. will soon have
36,000 troops in the area to counter the more than 63,000 estimated troops
that began moving toward Kuwait on October 2.

Haitians cheer departing former leader

Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, commander of the Haitian armed forces
resigned Monday. Cedras will seek asylum in an unknown country.
President Clinton announced that former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide
will return to Haiti Saturday. Cedras resigned to the cheers and singing of
the people he once ruled.

Terrorist attack in Israel kills 2

Jerusalem is recovering from the worst terrorist attack it has had in
years. Two Arabs from the Gaza strip ﬁred automatic weapons on the
people along a crowded street in downtown Jerusalem Sunday night,
killing two Israelis and wounding 13 others. A militant Islamic group
known as the Hamas has taken responsibility for the attack.

Nobel prize to go to both Rabin and Arafat

This year’s Nobel Peace Prize will go to Israel ’s Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin and P.L.O Chairman Yasir Arafat for the peace accord the two
nations signed in September 1993. This decision has caused division
within the Nobel committee and one member has threatened to resign.
Those opposed to giving the prize to Arafat say his organization espouses
terrorism.

Bodies of 48 cult members found in Switzer-
land

The bodies of 48 members of the Order of the Solar Temple have been
found in two Swiss villages. The deaths, which were first seen as a mass
suicide, then as mass murder, are now confusing investigators. The
location of the leader of the cult is missing; authorities do not know if he
is still alive or if his is one of the 25 bodies still unidentified. Police do not
know the cause of death for all the bodies, but believe that fires in both
villages were set off three hours apart. Some bodies had bullet wounds,
some were charred beyond recognition.

Colorado court’s decision a victory for gay
rights

In a victory for homosexuals, the Colorado Supreme Court struck down
a 1992 measure forbidding local governments to enact laws protecting gay
people from discrimination in jobs and housing. Colorado lost about $40
million in tourism from a boycott of the state that civil liberties groups and
gay rights organizations called for. The Court overturned overturned
Amendment 2 because it singled out a group of people for denial of basic
rights, violating both the Colorado and Federal Constitutions.

North blames Clinton for weak military

The State

Senate Candidate Oliver North took criticism for remarks made at a
news conference in Richmond about Bill Clinton. North suggested that the
U.S. could not stop an attack by Saddam Hussein on Kuwait and. accused
Clinton of creating a “hollow military.” North is in another statistical dead
heat with Democratic incumbent Charles Robb, though polls show North
is slightly ahead, according to a poll by The Washington Post.

A struggle broke out at Colonial Williamsburg on Monday over a
recreation of a slave auction. The Colonial Williamsburg foundation
promised a tasteful but moving dramatization of a slave auction. Protesters,
however, found fault with the scene’s taste and message. Six protesters
staged what began as a silent protest, and then pushed through the audience
singing “We Shall Overcome.” Costumed employees tried to push the,
demonstrators back behind the ropes. The scuffle lasted brieﬂy.

Annie
Lee joins
family in
Chapel

 

By SARAH GILBERT
Phi Executive Editor

Lee, Robert E. Lee’s daughter, were
interred in the Lee family crypt in the
Lee Chapel Oct. 6, only 132 years after
her death of typhoid during the
Civil War.

Annie Lee was buried near
Warrenton, N.C. when she died in 1862,
because it would have been impossible
to return her body to Lexington under
the circumstances of the war.

After the marble obelisk marking
her grave was toppled two years ago,
Lee’s descendants decided it was time
to bring her body to join the rest of her
family. Gen. Lee, his wife, and each of
his other six children were already in-
terred in Lee Chapel.

James Edwards, J r., the North Caro-
lina funeral director who oversaw the
exhumation, said they found bone frag-
ments, pieces of pine, and discolored,
hard-packed earth that indicated where
the bottom of the casket had been.
They packaged these remains in a new
yellow pine casket and shipped it to a
Lexington funeral home. It was in-
terred in the crypt late the night of
Oct. 6.

The principle opposition to the ex-
humation came from the Military Or-
der of Stars and Bars. The group’s
lawyer, Sam Currin, insisted that he
had heard that no remains had been
found in the grave.

“The confederate heritage groups

Lee Chapel is now the final resting place of all of Robert E. Lee’s children. The body 0

Annie Lee was moved from North Carolina to the Chapel.

Spring term: an opportunity to leave

of North Carolina will continue to pay
their respects to her grave,” Currin
said.

Lexington and Venture into the World -

By JENNIFER LATHAM
Phi Staff Writer

Why not spend spring break in Paris, Nlauiiu,
Costa Rica, the Southwest or the Galapagos Islands?
While you’re at it, why not spend all of spring
term there?

Once again, interested students must make plans
to sign up for the univeisity’s spring term abroad
programs. The numbers of students have recently
dwindled in Washington and Lee’s study abroad
programs in Paris and in Bavaria. While most other
departments consistently recruit enough students for
their term abroad programs, the French and German
departments have had decreasing numbers of
participants in the past three years.

Professor Roger Crockett of the German
department said four students went to Bavaria last
spring. In 1993, 10 students made the spring trip and
14 went in 1992. _

French Professor John Lambeth said numbers of
students have also ﬂuctuated for the spring term in
Paris. Last spring, eight students went, while 14 went
in 1993. In 1992 the trip was canceled because not
enough students signed up for it.

Why are the numbers so unpredictable?

Lambeth said some students decide not to study
abroad spring term because six weeks seems
too short.

“What I’m hearing more often is ‘I want to spend
the year abroad,”’ said Lambeth.

Russian professor Greta McCaughrin said
students have sometimes shied away from the pro-
gram in Russia because of the political and socioeco-
nomic situation there. But that doesn’t stop students
who want to learn about the country’s culture
and language.

“Because Russia is so cheap, I don’t think we’ll
have a minimal [number of students],” McCaughrin
said.

The German and French groups might get fewer
students not because their programs are less

appealing, but simply due to uncontrollable
circumstances, said professor Kirk Follo.

“Some years you really get crops of students
who are interested in going, some years you
don’t,” Follo said.

Even when interest is high, some students
might opt not to study abroad because they would
miss W&L too much. Students who have
participated in spring term abroad were initially
worried about living without Goshen, parties, and
a relaxed schedule.

Senior Katherine Adams traveled through New
Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado on the
geology program for three weeks last spring term.
She admits that she missed parts of the term
at W&L.

“The biggest thing I was bummed about miss-
ing was Noodle Fest, the Buffalo Creek Music
Festival,” Adams said. “But spring term, from
what I heard was nothing compared to our
freshman year. It wasn’t as fun. And we got back
in time for the senior party.”

Junior Jesse Taylor agreed that an experience
abroad surpasses spring term at W&L. Taylor
traveled to Madrid and Salamanca last
spring term.

“An awesome time in Lexington does not
compare with an awesome time there,” said
Taylor. “There was a group of W&L people who
you could hang out with, but at the same time, we
met a lot of Spaniards.”

Students who have gone abroad also offer
advice to those who are worried about heavy
course loads and limited free time in study
abroad programs.

“It was very relaxed,” said Taylor. “It was
almost like we weren’t in school.”

Senior Stacy Bogert said the program in
Germany was similar.

“I may have complained about the 23 churches
we saw in three weeks, but I think I learned a lot
there, even though I wasn’t trying to,” said Bogert.
“We didn’t want to hear about rococo and gothic
[architecture], but somehow it stuck in our minds.”

Senior LaKeisha Townes said she learned the most
from studying in Paris when she put down her books.
“I was able to get so much exposure to culture,

— language, and people...much more than you could ever

get in a classroom,” said Townes.

Although most students worried about missing W&L,
many also hesitated to go abroad because of the cost. 0

Financial Aid Director John DeCourcy said the trips
cost from $1500 to $3500 in addition to spring term
tuition. Students who apply for W&L loans and grants
usually have real ﬁnancial need, and most loan requests
are granted.

“If you need [financial aid], we’re here to help you,”
said DeCourcy, “but people have got to file applications
and jump through some hoops.” V

Bogert got a loan and grant for her trip from th
Financial Aid Office. She also paid for part of the trip
with money from a German scholarship and used her tax
returns as spending money.

“I definitely did not scrimp when I was there,” said
Bogert. “[Money from W&L for the trip} paid for
everything but beer and gifts.”

Townes was also satisfied with the help she got from
the Financial Aid Office.

“It didn’t bother me to take out a loan,” Townes said.
“They helped me out a lot.”

Getting a loan might be worth the effort if all spring
term abroad programs are as good as Bogert’s
and Taylor’s.

Bogert remembers “dancing on top of tables during
beer fests.”

Taylor said his trip to Spain gave him a chance to “see
how other cultures live and work” and to “take full
advantage of the siesta” after late nights out.

Directors of the spring term abroad programs will
talk with students about courses, excursions, and costs
of the trips in a meeting on Oct. 18 at 7 pm. in room 114
of the University Center.

Follo advises W&L students who participate in study
abroad programs through other universities. But he said
“our programs are very good and some of them are
reasonably priced.”

“For six weeks, you really can’t do any better,”
Follo said.

F.D. committee gearing up for Ball

Steering committee heads selected, begin working towards March

ByBE'I‘HANY BAUM/\l\
Phi Staff Writer

Although most Washington and Lee
students have not given much thought
to the 98th Annual Fancy Dress Ball,
the planning stage for the began
last May.

ItwasatthistimethatJoeFramptom,
Daniel Felton, and Kathy Boozer were
selected by the Executive Committee
as the chairman, vice chairman, and
auditor of the steering committee
responsible for the planning of the
March 3, 1995 ball.

Since being appointed, Framptom,
Felton, and Boozer have worked
through the logistical side of the
planning, formulating a budget,
resrving areas for decoration construc-
tion, and reworking the steering
committee’s structure.

During the first week of October
interviews for positions on the
committee were conducted by
Framptom and his colleagues.

Forty students, as opposed to last
year’s 59, were selected to serve on one
of six subcommittees; publicity, play-
bill, memorabilia, invitations, construc-
tion, and decorations. Over half of these
students will devote their time to the
decoration subcommittee.

There is a new position of entertain-
ment coordinator outside of the
subcommittees to be filled by one of
the 40 students. This person will con-
centrate on dealing directly with the
swing band that will be playing in the
Warner Center’s big gym, and with the
one or two rock bands that will be
entertaining in the small gym.

Also, the position of the big gym
coordinator has been replaced with a
coordinator for all of the decorations.
Framptom hopes that these two

positions, in conjunction with the scale
down, will the efficiency and
coherence of the committee.

The committee members will meet
for the first time on October 13th.
Before the end of the month, they will
have decided on a theme and booked
the entertainment. Memorabilia and
raw materials for the decoration
construction will be ordered before the
end of the fall term.

January will see the committee
members refining their plans and
designs as well as accumulating their
materials. The construction of
decorations will begin in the Pavilion
one week before the Washington holi-
day and will continue forthe two weeks
that follow it.

The FD Steering Committee will
not only have to abide by this schedule,
but will also have to work within the
confines of a $75,000 to $77,000 bud-
get. Boozer has laid out a conservative

financial plan forthis year’s FD in case
inclement weather reduces ticket and
memorabilia sales, as it did last year.

' A debt of several thousand dollars
was incurred last year because of this
reduction. However, that debt has not
been carried to this year’s budget. No
student activity funds will be used to
subsidize the costs of FD. It will rely
strictly on the sales of the $45 per
couple tickets and memorabilia
packages.

However, the cost of printing the
playbill is covered by the sales of its
advertisements. The members of the
Fancy Dress Steering Committee will
log countless hours of hard work over
the next four months while they are
preparing for the social event of the
year

However, come March 3, 1995,
there is little doubt that their efforts
will be greatly appreciated by the mem-
bers of the W&L community.

Parents’ Weekend means
e“real meal” opportunities

celebrate Parents’ Week-

end.
By KATHLEEN QUIRK
Phi Staff Writer

Mother Nature welcomes this weekend’s
visitors to Lexington with beautiful changing
leaves and weather that is cooling for fall but
still warm in the sun. Lexington restaurants are
preparing for hungry travelers, too. Here is a
quick guide to eating this Parents’ Weekend.

The highlight of many students’ weekends
will be a “real meal” at one of the nicer restau-
rants around. But the hungry should remember
to call ﬁrst as seats fill quickly.

The Inn at Union Run features a constantly
changing menu made fresh to every order,
including game and 0 homemade pasta dishes
and some very tempting desserts.

The inn is nestled on the side of a mountain,
and the scenery is wonderful now. Even those
not familiar with the area should be able to ﬁnd
the inn by taking Route 11/Route 251 South;
just over 2 1/2 miles past the Thrifty Inn is
Union Run Road (Route 674) where they should
take a left and travel about a half mile. Reser-
vations are required. (463-9715)

The Willson-Walker House Restaurant also
offers ﬁne dining to the city of Lexington and
features a special menu for Parents’ Weekend.

It is located downtown, within easy walk-
ing distance of campus, on Main Street between

I00.

In addition to their full
menu, they offer prime rib
on Saturday night.

The Southern Inn is on
Main Street
Nelson Street and Wash-
ington Street. Reservations
are accepted. (463-3612)

For more casual meals,
there are many ﬁne Lex-
ington eateries to try, most
within walking distance of
campus, and each ‘offers
something unique.

“ Hunan Garden (behind

McDonald’s) offers au-
, thentic Chinese dishesfas
well as the exotic “ﬂaming
volcano” which wins its
reputation with W&L stu-
- dents; the Golden Dragon
(by K-Mart) has Chinese

Spanky’s Restaurant
and Delicatessen on
Jefferson Street has an ex-
tensive menu of sand-
wiches, or patrons can de-
sign their own favorite
combination.

Wondering what to do with your
parents this weekend? Why not get to
know Lexington and the surrounding
area? You’ve lived here long enough!
Now is the time to learn some of its
history. Here are a few exciting sug-
gestions:

Closest to W&L, on the VMI cam-
pus, is the George C. Marshall museum
honoring the World War II general and
Nobel Peace Prize recipient. Accord-
ing to a museum representative, busi-
ness is brisk since this is the 50th anni-
versary of World War II. The museum
also contains a library and an archive
that holds the papers of Marshall and
some of his contemporaries. The mu-
seum is open 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. Monday
through Saturday and 2 p.m. - 5 p.m. on
Sunday. Admission is $3.00 for adults
and $1.00 for children from 7 - 18.

The Lexington Visitors’ Center of-
fers carriage tours daily from 9:30 a.m.
to 4:30 p.m.. Located at 106 East
Washington Street, the tour goes past
the Stonewall Jacson House, the re-
stored downtown area, the 19th cen-

tury residential section, and ﬁnally,
past the Stonewall Jackson cemetary.

If you didn’t getenough of the Stone-
wall Jackson House from the carriage
tour, you can delve inside until 5 pm
daily. This was Jackson’s house for ten
years before the Civil War while he
was a professor at VMI.

Forthe nature lovers the Blue Ridge
Parkway and Goshen Pass are two
places you must visit this weekend.
The Blue Ridge Parkway connects
Shenandoah National Park in Virginia
with the Great Smoky Mountain Na-
tional Park in North Carolina and Ten-
nessee. The closest entrance to the
Parkway from Lexington is off of
Route 60 East about 15 minutes from
town. Goshen Pass, a W&L spring-
time favorite, is a mountain gorge ap-
proximately 30 minutes down Route
39 off of Route 11 North. Before the
development of the railroad in 1880,
Goshen Pass was a crossing for stage-
coaches.

Another interesting escape from
Lexington is Staunton, home of the
Statler Brothers and Woodrow
Wilson’s birthplace. Wilson’s birth-
place, a National Historical Monument
and artifact museum, is open from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Staunton is 30
miles north of Lexington on I-81.

PAGE 3

Finally, no historical journey can be
complete without a trip to Natural
Bridge, one of the Seven Natural Won-
ders of the World. Located off of
Route 11 South, Natural Bridge, the
town, consists of, not only a natural
wonder, but a wax museum, a zoo, and
caverns as well. Attractions of the wax
museum include a six minute ﬁlm pre-
sentation of the Last Supper and a
factory tour showing where the new
wax figures are made. The zoo fea-
tures 300 - 400 different species of
animals.

According to a representative, “You
can get a lot closer to the animals here
than at the bigger zoos. You can feed
pretty much any animal in the zoo
except for the tigers and large cats.”
Guided tours are offered through Natu-
ral Bridge Caverns. The guides sug-
gest that you wear comfortable shoes.
Combination ticket prices are avail-
able for all attractions at $13.00 for an
adult. All three are open seven days a
week. Hours are: Natural Bridge 8
a.m. - 7 p.m., Wax Museum 10 a.m. - 6
p.m., and Caverns 10 a.m. - 5 p.m.

If you have any questions, the Lex-
ington Visitors’ Center is sure to help
with more precise information. Lo-
cated on East Washington Street, the
center is open until 5 p.m. daily.

.L2eve games at /W&J;

By COURTNEY MILLER
Phi Staff Writer

Finding that “special someone” to date
at W&L is nearly impossible. The typical
American ritual of dating has disappeared and
been replaced by “hooking up” at a party with
someone of the opposite sex. Luckily for those
die hard romantics out there, The Dating Game
is striving to preserve some warped aspect of
dating.

The season premier of Chris Albert’s
baby was well worth watching. It aired
Monday Oct. 10 at 6:30 p.m. on W&L’s own
cable channel 2. One lucky bachelorette,
Megan McCloskey had her choice of three
bachelors. It was obvious why the three men
were single, but McCloskey was quite a mys-
tery.

The Dating Game is production of

W&L’s journalism and communications de-
partment. The graphics are excellent, although
it would work better to display the names of the
contestants earlier in the game. The camera
work keeps with the spirit of the show, cutting
to cheesy pans of the audience laughing at such
lines as, “I like fast cars and fast women.”

McCloskey’s questions for her bach-
elors reveal quite a bit about the personalities of
each of the guys, but often had some interesting
innuendoes.

Overall Chris Albert does an excel-
lent job of capturing a unique look at the dating
life of W&Lstudents. The Dating Game is well j
worth the half an hour study break. Last year’s 1
best shows can be seen Oct. 17-19 at 6:30 p.m., '.
and a this year’s next new show will be shown ‘
Oct. 24. ‘

For more information, and possible a ‘.
personal appearance on The Dating Game, call 2

The Southern Inn is another great choice to

Harb’s Bistro on Washington Street may be
Lexington’s most cosmopolitan restaurant; they
feature a great happy hour and a fun outdoor
patio area when the weather is warm.

Their “House Mountain” nachos are a
worthy tribute to the local landmark, possibly
the best around.

The Palms, that Lexington landmark at
Nelson and Jefferson Streets, offers more than
just the social life of the over-21 crowd.

Theirmenu containsvarious American-style
foods, and their popcorn is a definite treat.

The Raven and Crown, across from campus
on Lee Avenue, has a great pub atmosphere and
serves good American pub fare.

They set themselves apart from the crowd

most local restaurants.

Lexington also has some highly unique eat-
ing establishments which bold students may
wish to visit with their parents, or perhaps save
for another visit. .

Topping this list is, of course, the restaurant
at Lee-Hi truck stop — open 24 hours, and
serving breakfast all day and night.

The Blue Heron Cafe on Washington Street
offers vegetarian cuisine; by contrast, Pete’s
Bar-B-Que Station serves up pork, beef and
chicken down by Stop-In.

And no adventurous parent should miss the
Evans Dining Hall if they want to fell the full
force of their student’s W&L experience.

Quiz Show — 1’§n’.‘z1/2

It might seem to some social commentators that America’s
history is simply a series of cultural deﬂowerin gs, a long set
of brutal awakenings and disillusionings.

And in this list, which accommodates everything from
the Black Sox Scandal to Watergate, there is very promi-
nently featured the corrupt game shows of the ﬁfties, espe-
cially NBC’s Twenty-One.

It is the story of that program which is the subject for
Robert Redford’s latest directorial effort, Quiz Show.

Twenty-One is a very successful game show in which
contestants answer trivia questions, receiving points for
their efforts.

The first to twenty-one points wins the game and the
money, and gets to return the next week.

For several weeks the show is dominated by a swarthy,
working—class nerd from Queens, Herbert Stempel (John
Turturro).

He is able to recall facts with incredible precision, and
the whole nation thrills to see this underdog consistently
defeat his cleaner, neater, more composed opponents.

But after a while, the nation gets tired of this little man
who, despite the glamour and success, is still essentially a
loser.

So the big men at NBC decide its time to make a change:
they seize upon an upcoming contestant, Charles Van Doren

(Ralph Fiennes).

Van Doren is a young, handsome college professor
whose relatives are all prominent academics.

He is ﬁrst given questions he already knows the answers
to, then he is given the questions themselves beforehand,
and soon enough he is winning gobs of money.

At the same time, he is also entrancing the nation’s quiz
show viewers.

He is the beautiful WASP hero the nation had always
wanted.

As a result, the ratings soar, and Van Doren lands
himself on the cover of Time.

But, as you might have guessed, Stempel was none too
pleased to have been given the boot.

So when the executives fail to find other television work
for him, he gets mad and starts a grand jury investigation.

The grand jury reveals nothing (due to NBC’s tamper-

ing?), but the story gets noticed by a young Congressional
staffer, Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow).

He prods and pushes and nose around enough until
ﬁnally he ﬁnds conclusive evidence that the show has been
rigged.

In fact, not only was Van Doren given the answers, so
was Stempel and every other champion of the past.

The whole thing had been sour from the very beginning.

The resulting Congressional hearings expose the falsity
of television and the sham that is the entertainment industry.
America cries herself to sleep and wakes up bitter and
disillusioned.

Or so Redford would have us believe.

He clearly means for the whole movie to reflect the
hollowness of the WASP ideal and the American Dream.

I am not too convinced he does so successfully, but it
does make for interesting thinking, especially coming from

watch it.

W&L, where the WASP ideal is still embraced with much
romantic passion.

Setting aside its didactics, the movie is not too bad. The
acting is on the whole quite good, especially from Ralph
Fiennes.

If you remember his brilliant work in Schindler ’s List,
you will not be disappointed here. .

Turturro portrays such a sad and pathetic ﬁgure that I
have a hard time deciding whether my distaste for his
character is a sign of the performance’s strength or its
weakness.

Rob Morrow is generally competent, with the exception
of his disastrous attempt at a Boston accent.

His voice does not remain constant from one scene to the
next, and this blatant failure makes his character much,
much weaker.

The one truly Oscar-worthy performance comes from
Paul Scoﬁeld, playing the elder Van Doren, Mark.

The role is probably too small even to be called “sup-
porting."

However, he does a fantastic job as the saddened father,
who sees his son’s destruction played out before of millions.

Robert Redford does a passable job as the director. What
really hinders him from telling a good story, though, is the
inherent lack of movement in the story line.

At every step ofthe line, we already know what is going
to happen, and why.

There are no intriguing plot-twists. The dramatic irony of
the situation is never handled as successfully as it must be
for this movie to work at its best.

Essentially the movie is historical ﬁction, adding a little
tense dialogue and a few neat cinematographic stunts, but at
root still just a documentary.

Without the acting of Ralph Fiennes or the crisp, sleek
ﬁfties’ sets, this movie is much poorer.

Even now, it is probably only worth a video rental.

Alcohol use and abuse preval

I-9 SURVEY, from page 1

to W&L.

Juniorlason Hurst added, ‘‘I ’ve been
to other campuses and seen the
same thing.”

Anna Bentley, a junior, agreed.

“W&L is not alone,” she said. “It is
a large part of the student culture and it
can be used excessively.”

Most members of the Washington
and Lee community would agree that
excessive alcohol abuse is evident.

While virtually all students under-
stand the related negative conse-
quences, students don’t seem to be
dramatically changing their behaviors.
What students know and can tell you
about substance abuse and what they
practice are two very different things.
Howison believes that real progress
will be made only when students bridge
that gap. Until then, educators and coun-
selors may as well be talking to a
brick wall.

A Workshop on Early Identiﬁca-
tion and Prevention of the Negative
Consequences of Alcohol and Sub-
stance Use is scheduled for Monday,
October 17. This will be one of the
administration ’s first attempts since the
release of the survey results to try and
break down that brick wall, and actu-
ally reach some students.

Fifty-three percent of Washington and Lee students say they had 10 or more drinking episodes during the 1992-
1993 school year in which they consumed ﬁve to 10 drinks. Another 28 percent say they have been a passenger
in a car with a drunk driver. The survey also showed that women drink less than men.

he REVIEW, from page 1

disappointment that W&L is one of
“the leaders in intolerance,” refer-
ring to the #4 ranking in the cat-
egory of Gay Students Ostracized,
Discriminated Against.

“On such a traditional campus,”
said Howison, “there is a reluctance
to accept other lifestyles.”

While this may be a prevalent
attitude, no one sited actual events
of ostracism or discrimination.

“Since I have not been made
aware of any instances of gay stu-
dents having been ostracized, this
ranking surprises me,” said Man-
ning.

While anonymous students spoke
freely to the Princeton Review about
homosexuality, none were willing
to comment on the record about

W&L ranks 4th in
gay discrimination

attitudes here.

The ranking of #1 on the Greek
scene came as a surprise to few.

“Fraternities and sororities deﬁ-
nitely dominate the social scene,”
said senior Chris Albert, “but it’s
still possible to enjoy life here as an
independent.”

Students admitted there few op-
tions for independents, “but they
knew that when they came here,”
said Boone.

The high party marks and the
high academic marks seem to bal-
ance. The 11th Happiest Student
Body attends class on the 14th Most
Beautiful Campus, enjoying the
19th Best Quality of Life.

“We’re ranked in so many cat-
egories,” said Howison.

“That’s a real testimony to the
distinct character of Washington
and Lee.”

In eight short months, there should
be a new occupant in Washington Hall
23, the president’s office.

The Presidential Search Commit-
tee, composed of various faculty mem-
bers, presidents of the law and under-
graduate alumni associations, the past
I president of the student body, and the
past president of the law school, has
been meeting during the spring and
summer of this year to narrow the pool
of 135 applications down to 40.

They will further narrow the 40
down to ten for presentation to the
board of trustees, who are meeting at
the end of this month.

The Presidential Selection commit-
tee, composed of various members of
the Board of Trustees, will interview

and present a candidate for the board to

Presidential
search down to 40

vote on at their February meeting. The
new president should have accepted by
June.

Chairman of the committee, Profes-
sor William Watt, said “in the first
swipe through we found 40 good pos-
sibilities, so the ten should be excep-
tional.”

Watt was also the chairman for the
committee that chose President John
Wilson in 1982.

Asked whether the 40 people cho-
sen already included a woman, Watt
simply responded by saying the group
was “quite diverse.” He added that the
ages in the group of 40 applicants var-
ied between 40 and 60.

He said there were no restrictions
put on how the applicants were se-
lected.

So far Watt said it was a “very
successful exercise,” so we should have
an exceptional president ready to start
building by the end of next year.

Lex laws

By KATHRYN MAYURNIK
Phi Staff Writer

Vivisection. Experimentation.
Abandonment. All of these things
can be regarded by some people as
cruelty to animals, an action that no
honorable, dog-loving, W&L stu-
dent would be a part of.

Just spending a few minutes on
the Hill, one can witness the stu-
dents and their dogs bonding play-
ing a game of Frisbee, running to-
gether in the grass, or playing the
popular “fetch the English paper.”
But then there is also the common
scene of a dog and the tree that he is
tied to. According to Virginia state
law, this is considered cruelty to
animals. Last week, Cole Van Nice
and Less Borden, W&L students,
learned about this law the hard way.

While Van Nice and Borden were
at class, they tied their dogs, lager
and Boomer, to the trees outside
their fraternity house. Officer R.D.
Clark of the Lexington Police De-
partment arrived at the scene and
took the dogs into custody, despite
the protests of the fraternity broth-
ers who, Van Nice says, were watch-
ing and caring for the dogs.

According to the law, any dog
that is tied up without adequate food,
water, and shelter can be taken into
custody by the police. If the owner
is convicted in a court of law, the
ﬁne can run up to $75. Otherwise,
the owner just has to pay for the
boarding of the dog, which is $8

a day.

allow dogs
left tied tobe taken

When Van Nice and Borden ar-
rived back home that day, they were
shocked that man’s best friend was
not there to greet them. When they
went to pick up their pooches and
discovered that the charge was fail-
ure to perform ownership duties,
they were particularly outraged.

“lager is a four-month old Ger-
man Shepherd puppy,” Van Nice
explained. “He needs to be around
people who will care for him. 1 left
him with my fraternity brothers
because I knew he would be better
taken care of there instead of on
the Hill.”

Van Nice claims that there was
a bowl of water out, although it had
been kicked over, lager had al-
ready been fed, and it was a beauti-
ful sunny day. There were plenty of
people looking after the dog, and
he sees nothing cruel about that.

According to Officer Clark, the
law is good because “it is intended
for the protection and welfare of
the animal.”

Although the situation between
Van Nice and Borden has been
settled with the police, Van Nice
feels that the situation is ironic.

“Ifl had tied him up on the Hill
unattended,withoutfood.waterand
shelter, I wouldn’t have gotten into
trouble with the police,” Van Nice
commented. ‘‘I was performing
good ownership duties by leaving
him at the house.Theironicthingis
that now I might have to leave him
out on the Hill. This law seems to

be hurting the dogs, rather than I

helping them.”

threatening man-
ner. He may pre-
vent her from go-
ing out with
friends and isolate her from the world.
He may prevent her from getting a job
or use the children as a bargaining chip
to get what he wants out of her by
threatening to take them away. Emo-
tional abuse and blame are also signifi-
cant components of the broad category
of domestic violence.

The abuser gradually chips away at
the victim’s self-esteem over time by
putting her down and making her feel
bad about herself. He always tries to
minimize and deny the abuse. Finally,
sexual abuse is nearly always unfortu-
nately a player in the realm of
domestic violence.

The vast majority of women who
are victims are often forced to succumb
to forced sex or even marital rape
through coercion, threats, or another of
the above-mentioned forms of intimi-
dation. The emotional and psycho-
logical impacts of domestic violence
can be brutal. The longer such abuse
lasts, the deeper into the pit of despair
the victim will sink as she is isolated
from friends and all potentially caring
persons. She believes that the abuse
may be a consequence of her own be-
havior and poor judgment. This is
often the ultimate goal of the abuser,
who, as a result of his own insecurity
seeks complete control over all aspects
of his spouse’s life.

It is important to keep in mind that
not all such relationships are connu-
bial. In fact, many abusive spouses
begin a pattern of abuse during their
teen years which is carried on through-
out their college years as well.

Fortunately, there is help for the
battered spouse. As Pam Patton, col-
umnist for The News-Gazette, said in a
recent article, “Sometimes we prefer to
believe that these things don’t happen
here in Rockbridge Countv.” People

sion becomes a

process of seem-

ingly unbearable
ain.

That is why there are special hotlines
and organizations in town to ease this
process. One of the more prominent
organizations is called Project Hori-
zon. Project ‘Horizon was conceived
by two workers at the Rockbridge
Mental Health Clinic and Department
of Social Services. The Project first
began as a spouse abuse information
pamphlet detailing the available ser-
vices for abused adults. It gained mo-
mentum in the late summer of 1983,
beginning a public awareness cam-
paign, holding several programs on
domestic violence, and receiving local
media coverage during Domestic Vio-
lence Awareness Week. In 1985, a
domestic violence hotline was estab-
lished. It was coordinated and staffed
by 20 volunteers on evenings and week-
ends. In the late 1980’s, the role of
Project Horizon became more pro-
nounced with an increase in the hotline
to 24-hour service and the provision of
emergency shelter services with the
additional availability of long-term
shelter provision through alternative
sources. Project Horizon’scurrent goal
is the establishment of their own long-
temi shelter here in Rockbridge County.
In addition, there is now a weekly sup-
port group for victims of domestic vio-
lence as well as a day care program for
the victim’s children.

The support group is the single most
therapeutic system available for vic-
tims as they are able to grapple with
their fears and insecurities with their
peers: those who have experienced the
same hellish nightmare of domestic
abuse. “Support group is an opportu-
nity for victims to express their fear,
anxiety and anger in a safe environ-
ment,” says Lorri Olan, Project
Horizon’s Client Services Coordina-
tor. At first victims are reluctant to join

after that. They come back because
they come to realize that they are not
alone and that they are not the ones
with the problem,‘ that they are
only victims.

The hotline is without a doubt the
most important service the Project pro-
vides in that it provides a comforting
listener, someone who will lend a sym-
pathetic ear to an abused spouse and
will let her know what her options are.
People manning the hotline are volun-
teers, many of whom are students at
W&L. All volunteers on the hotline
are female, as most callers happen to be
female and would certainly feel awk-
ward talking to a male upon making
initial contact with the Project. Many
volunteers from the school are enrolled
in developmental psychology and ob-
tain volunteer hours for their class by
working for the Project.

For those who are interested in vol-
unteering, the next training meetings
will occur in January and will be di-
vided into two three hour sessions.
Even though men are not able to work
on the hotline, they are still encouraged
to volunteer for
the program if
they have an in-
terest as their as-

thing that will happen in a mild case
should a victim choose to prosecute is
that a civil protective order will be
issued by the judge if he so chooses
upon hearing the victim’s plea. If the
abuser violates this order, the victim
can call the police and press criminal
charges. In more serious cases such as
battery or assault, criminal proceed-
ings are in order. In some cases the
victim does not wish to follow through
with the proceedings for obvious rea-
sons, such as the humiliation involved
in public confession or simply the over-
whelming fear that such proceedings
will not produce the desired result, that
is the imprisonment of the batterer.
Often the victim will abandon the case
with hopes that their relationship with
the abuser can be remedied. In certain
cases when the victim does not follow
through, the state can assume the case,
if it deems that it has a strong case,
worthy of prosecution.

There are numerous other things the
Project is doing specifically for Do-
mestic Violence Awareness Month.
Among them are included prevention
programs at the el-
ementary and jun-
ior high schools, a

They are equipped with manuals that
provide guidelines for what to do in

which provide food stamps and other
provisions to ﬁnancially troubled fami-

serve a similar purpose, Rockbridge
Mental Health Clinic, Parent Empow-

experienced or abused parents, and the

There are also

speaking engage-
ments on the subject of domestic vio-
lence at local symposiums. The
Rockbridge Regional Library in Lex-
ington, the Best Seller, the Bookery
and the Second Story Bookshop will
have displays of books and materials
dealing with domestic violence. Rib-
bon-tying displays will be located in
various spots around town and the
University at which people can tie rib-
bons in honor sexual assault or domes-
tic violence. W&L also hosted a play
on Tuesday, Oct. 11 dealing with date
rape entitled “But I Said No.” The
W&L Law School will hold a sympo-
sium on domestic abuse on Oct. 26.

and an all too common occurrence.

Hopefully this month the word will
get out through the combined efforts of
Project Horizon and other organiza-
tions in the area.

Date rape theater
show visits W&L

By DAN ODENWALD
Phi Staff Writer

“But I Said No,” a play about
acquaintance rape, captured its au-
dience with the realistic portrayals
of real-life rape survivors’
stories Tuesday night in the
Lenfest Center.

Written by Margaret Baldwin
and Doug Grissom, the play was
performed by the Offstage Theater
Company of Charlottesville, Vir-
ginia. Audience members were
clearly moved by the “powerful”
performance and some were even
brought to tears. According to the
performers, the play was intended
to promote sympathy for victims of
rape and teach them they are
not alone.

The Offstage Theater Company,
created in 1990, has toured the na-
tion with “Butl Said No.” The group
originated within the University of
Virginia Theater and later contin-
ued on to establish their own com-
pany. They perform for colleges
and high schools throughout the
nation promoting awareness about
date rape. The group also has pre-
sented their work to national
conferences of male and
female fraternities.

During the perfonnance, the ac-
tors allude to sortie grim statistics.
Among these are one in four college
women are victims of date rape.
Alcohol is involved in 90 percent of
all rapes. 90 percent of acquain-
tance rapes victims are between their
senior year in high school and fresh-
man year in college. Finally, it is
estimated that as many as 90 per-

cent of rapes go unreported.

The Washington and Lee Uni-
versity Health Committee distrib-
uted a pamphlet before the perfor-
mance. It offers steps in avoiding
potential rape scenarios such as keep-
ing communication lines open and
honest between men and women. It
emphasizes personal responsibility
by avoiding excessive alcohol con-
sumption which may cloud judge-
ment. The pamphlet also offers ac-
tions which should be taken if you
are assaulted. For example, it re-
minds victims that it is not their
fault, to tell someone immediately,
and to get medical exam before
showering. The pamphlet also re-
minds friends of victims to be sup-
portive and not to judge or blame.

After the performance, the per-
formers led an interactive audience
discussion. The responses to the play
were positive. Most agreed the play
was “draining to watch and
very powerful.”

Some suggested improvements
such as a lengthier and more fo-
cused treatment of same-sex as-
saults. Another congratulated the
script for calling the survivors
of date rape survivors instead
of victims.

By providing for programs like
“But I Said No,” the W&L Health
Education Committee hopes to in-
crease awareness of sexual assault
on campus.

University Health officials rec-
ommend reading the literature about
sexual assault services for the school
and the surrounding community
which can be located in both the
University Center and the Student
Health Center.

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

To raise or not to raise?

Last week, Executive Committee Vice President Alex
Cross proposed that the EC raise the student activity fee as
much as $15 or $20 from its current level of $135 per student,
per year.

Each fee increase of one dollar will raise approximately
$2000 more for the student body. A $15 increase will increase
the EC’s disposable income by $30,000.

An increase of $15, however, would not greatly increase
the amount of money available to the BC; the committee was
“tight,” according to Cross, this year with a $15,000 grant
thanks to President John Wilson and $15,000 left from the
previous year. A $20 increase, or $40,000, would leave the
EC with a “buffer” fund to carry over from year to year, or
more money to spend on bands, Mock Convention, and
student publications.

“With a little bit of foresight, we won’t have to raise the fee
for two or three more years,” said Cross. “Last time the EC
raised it, they didn’t take into account that we would have to
raise it again so soon.”

An extra $15 or $20 on top of a $13,000+ tuition will not
strain anyone’s pocketbook. The fee goes straight back to us,
for our pleasure, edification and appetite, so money lost (and
probably never felt) is really money gained for an entire
community.

The EC is hoping for feedback from students; stop by a
meeting or drop a note in the University Center. It can only
benefit us all.

Statistics can prove anything...

Between high school English class and perhaps English
213 here at W&L, I’m sure most everyone has read Jonathan
Swift’s essay, “A Modest Proposal.”

Swift threw out statistic after statistic to satirically justify
the consumption of economically disadvantaged Catholic
children in Ireland so their parents could live more comfort-
ably and problems such as overpopulation and hunger. Swift
advised the Irish to commence cannibalism in an effort to
caution the reader about the many ways in which statistics
may be interpreted.

He makes the point that behind every statistic there is a
human being and an individual.

There are three stories in this issue of the Phi, whose
subject is based almost solely on polls and other statistical
data. These stories paint a very distinct, and many times
wholly negative, picture of Washington and Lee University.

Much of the information is probably dangerously close to
the truth. But all of it should be taken with a grain of salt.
These are statistics, and any good C-school student knows
that statistics can be manipulated to prove almost anything.

It does not necessarily follow that someone did manipulate
the numbers in order to cast a dark shadow over the school.
But the numbers can and will be taken too seriously (just as
some people took Swift in absolute seriousness and wrote
letters to the editors of British papers denouncing his foolish
idea).

We suggest you use the numbers only as an addendum to
the personal information you already have from your experi-
ence at Washington and Lee. If any of it shocks or disappoints
you, remember, the data came from former students. If you do
not agree with anything, no one better than you can make the
results different next time.

Quote of the Week:

“It will be held over at the witch school —I mean,
the law school.”
——Professor of English Dabney Stuart, announcing
the lecture on “Possession, Witchcraft, and the Law
in Jacobean England. ”

Winning Congress won’t change America

NICHOLAS L.
WADDY, ’96

 

Any Republican who has been pay-
ing even remote attention to the news
has tobe excited. This Fall, forthe first
time in 40 years, Republicans look
poised to do magniﬁcently at the polls.
Some commentators have predicted
that the GOP will take control of the
Senate; this would most likely force
Clinton to make a radical turn to the
right and might, therefore, truly spell
the end of the Old Democrats. But
even more exciting is the possibility,
conﬁdently held out by none other than
Newt Gingrich, that Republicans might
win control of the House of Represen-
tatives; such a blessed turn of events, if
we recall, has not occurred since the
administration of Harry Truman. It
would represent a watershed in Ameri-
can politics.

Two things work to limit the giddy
enthusiasm of Republicans at this stage,
however. First, none of this has hap-
pened yet. Commentators predicted
massive changes would occur during
and after the Congressional elections
of 1992 as well, and we all know how
disappointingly that turned out. In-
deed, so little has changed in Washing-
ton that now, for the first time in poll-
ing history, a majority of Americans
are dissatisﬁed with not only the Con-
gress in general, but with their Con-

gressman.

Second, though, Republicans must
draw back from jubilation for an even
more signiﬁcant reason: the American
people, who are currently demonstrat-
ing so much enthusiasm for the GOP,
are the same bunch of numskulls who
elected all our current Congressmen,
not to mention Bill Clinton, in the first
place. I know that many Republicans
sincerely believe that America’s salva-
tion lies in the election, say, of Oliver
North to the Senate, or perhaps in con-
trol of the Senate itself, but I entertain
no such delusions. I believe, rather,
that who controls the Congress is, in
the broader perspective of history,
rather unimportant.

It is worth dwelling on this latter
point, so let us pause to consider for a
moment just what it is that we conser-
vatives believe about American soci-
ety and how it works. It is old-hat to
say that Democrats believe (usually, at
least, even if they never admit it) that
‘government is the answer to the prob-
lems of individuals’ — but what do
Republicans believe?

I propose the following: Republi-
cans believe, or at least they should,
that individuals are the answer to the
problems of government and society
—— the exact converse of the Demo-
crats’ belief, logically enough. What
this means is that Republicans put the
burden of action on individuals, ex-
pecting them to behave in socially ben-
eﬁcial ways, while Democrats put the
burden on government to facilitate the
welfare of individuals. It is, to be
simplistic, a question of statism versus
individualism. Republicans have al-
ways believed in the potential of indi-

viduals, and have thus been willing to
give those individuals the freedom to
pursue their own designs. The ﬂip side
of this freedom is the fact that Repub-
licans are much more willing to hold

stead of legislators should give us a
glimmer of an even more distressing
fact: Americans consistently vote for
Democrats not because they are, at
heart, conservatives who just happen

This is a very theoretical argument,
I realize, but it has consequences for
what we were discussing before, the
Fall elections. First, since a nation is a
collection (albeit organic) of individu-
als, what really counts is not who is
making the laws, but who is electing
the lawmakers; it is the strength, the
intelligence, and the nobility of char-
acter of the average citizen that will
determine the welfare of the state. It
goes without saying that a single elec-
tion will seldom change any of these.
And second, this focus on people in-

suggest, then, is that Liberalism is much
more than just a maniacal collection of
conupt and despicable politicians; it
is, rather, in its most dangerous form, a
mindset — a mindset that enjoys con-
siderable currency with the American
people. If conservatives want to carry
the day in the United States, therefore,
then they will have to begin looking at
the bigger picture. Losing an election
to conservatives is a setback to Liber-
als, but only losingthe hearts and minds
of America to conservativism would
be a deathblow.

CLARKE,
’96

 

One of my most vivid memories from junior
high school is of watching the Iran-Contra trials.
They were on every channel, like O..l. is now. There
was a time when I could sketch Oliver North from
memory because I saw him on TV so much. Now
the same face is back on TV and in the papers as
“fonner Marine Colonel Oliver North runs for the
Senate from the Old Dominion.”

The situation is far scarier this time. To even
imagine that a man who blatantly lied to Congress
may be elected to that same body is devestating. It
is far worse than Iran-Contra, because that was
conducted without the knowledge of the public.
Now the citizens are fully infonned, they know his
past, and they know the disgust that many decent
people feel.

Admittedly, North was not actually convicted of
lying to Congress, he got off on a technicality. The
sameconservativeswhocomplain about othercrimi-

rials getting out of jail because of technicalities and

criticize the judicial system are unwilling to shine
the same bright light into the recesses of the judicial

process when it concerns North.

People have suggested that the attack on North
is based on the segment of the population that has
never served in the military. He has suggested this
of Chuck Robb. However, Robb was a Marine
Corp Major who served in Vietnam, something he

could have easily have gotten out
of, considering his father-in-law
was the President.

Former Joint Chiefs chairman
and potential GOP presidential
nominee Gemeral Colin Powell
has said, “Based on my work ex-
perience with him [North], and
my knowledge, Colonel North is

not someone I would sup rt or
vote for. I know the ield of
candidates. I have worked with
them...and Colonel North is the
only one I would eliminate.”
Former Navy Secretary,
James H. Webb (a Republican) is
supportingRobbbecause“...ithas
become imperative for anyone
who respects the Marine Corps as

an institution to say ‘enough is enough.’” These men
understand the military mindset and they still see

North as being wrong.

Character more important than issues

The basic fact is that North lied. If he had been a
student here he would have been asked to leave

because of an Honor Violation.

(C

The basic fact is
that North lied.
If he had been a
student here he
would have been
asked to leave
because of an
Honor Violation.

 

Let’s consult a more fundamental source then the
Honor System, the Bible. North and his supporters
wave the Bible around and condemn Robb for his
marital indescretions. The Bible objects just as strongly
to lying. “Lying lips are abomination to the Lord,”

(Proverbs 12:22) or “He that
worketh deceit shall not dwell
within ny house: he that telleth
lies shallnot tarry in my sight”
(Psalms 101:7). How conve-
nient North supporters can ig-
nore that part of the Bible.

The voters are focusing
on character.

Polls have found that the ma-
jority of Virginia voters have
no idea where their candidates
stand on speciﬁc issues.

People are voting without
considering whether the candi-
dates represent them. Then these
same people will complain
about Congress not represent-
ing them.

It’s times like these that I am glad to be a registered
voter of Florida. Miami may have its share of crimi-

nals, but we don’t have Ollie.

Betsy finds booze, smokes and guns

GREEN LAND
Betsy Green

There are certain pieces of Wash-
ington and Lee culture—icons, if you

x will— that every student should, at

some point, experience. Spring term
trips to Goshen. The General Lee at
Lee-Hi. A bad hook-up. The wide ar-
ray of party pics after Fancy Dress

' ' (“l’d planned to just look for my black

dress!”). Taco bar at Letitia Pate Evans
Dining Hall. I’d like to add another

~ ‘icon that should be a part of W&L life:

Kelly’s Comer.

About two and a half miles away
from campus, past Liberty Hall ruins,
past the Keydet-General is this true
piece of Americana. Kelly’s Comer is
exactly the kind of place my dad took
me before a ﬁshing trip. lt’s aplace that
deﬁes the passage of time, a place to
revere. At least, that’s what my dad
would tell me.

On the outside, Kelly’s Corner
doesn’t look like much, which is ex-
actly how it should look. A place like
Kelly’s Corner doesn’t need a fancy
logo or neon sign. Some chipped white
paint, an old Coca Cola sign, and ad-
vertisements for live bait and ﬁshing
and hunting licenses are all that is
needed. Any time of day, any day of the
week, you’ll see a pickup truck
outside.

Once you head inside Kelly’s Cor-

ner, it is readily apparent what their
major source of income is. Cases of
Natural Light are stacked to the ceil-
ing. Two coolers are filled with
Milwaukee’s Best. Another cooler is
packed with Bud, Coors, and Pabst.
Almost hidden behind the Coors are
two dusty bottles of white wine and a
lone Zima. These people’s priorities
are as clear as their target audience.
Kelly’s Comer seems to supple-
ment their sales of cheap beer with a
dazzling array of potato chips, but don ’t
even think about ﬁnding some reduced
fat Dorito’s there. A few of the other
food items for sale seem considerably
more unpopular. One goes to Kelly’s
Comer to buy beer and chips, not to
buy Vienna Sausages, spaghetti, maple
syrup, and especially not feminine hy-
giene products. Although I did not con-
duct any interviews, I’d feel pretty
secure in saying that the average Kelly ’s
Comer customer scoffs at the idea of
buying feminine hygiene products.
Items like duct tape (the solution to any
given problem in the universe), sand-
wich ﬁxings, and, inexplicably, huge
wheels of cheese are also quick sellers.
Kelly’s Corner is also a unique
source for fashion. Eventually safety
orange and camouﬂage will be all the
rage on the runways. Why pay the high
Paris designer prices or wait for them
to come to TGIF when you can get
them now at Kelly’s Corner? Any out-
ﬁt becomes instantly memorable when
you add an orange vest. At least you’ll

be easier to spot in those FD party pics.

Kelly’s Corner doubles as a good
place hang out. The back room does
have sparse concrete floors, ‘but it also
has a pool table. I’d love to go there
some after-
noon to
hustle good
ol’ boys at
nine ball
like Marisa
Tomei in
My Cousin
Vinny. The
back room
also houses
video games
that time for-
got. Bring a
stack of
quarters to
play Ms. Pac
Man and
Atari’s Kangaroo.

For those desiring a little adult en-
tertainment, Kelly’s Corner has cur-
rent issues of Playboy, Penthouse, Hus-
tler, and Oui. There are also stacks of
old issues of Playboy to rival the col-
lection of even the most avid...err,
reader. If you really need a copy ofthe
1977 College Girls of the South spe-
cial, this is the place to go.

Need a gun? Need bullets? I’m tell-
ing you, Kelly’s Corner is like one stop
shopping. As my beloved ex-husband
Joel Symonds and the incomparable
Trip Kucera are wont to point out,

 it also has a pool
table. I ’d love to go there
some aﬂernoon to hustle
good ol’ boys at nine ball
like Marisa Tomei in
My Cousin Vinny

tobacco, alcohol, and ﬁrearms must
belong together, or else the govem-
ment wouldn’t have put them together.
I once had a fascinating discussion
with a Kelly’s Corner employee about
gun laws in
Virginia. Per-
haps spotting
me as a lib-
eral, she ex-
plained, “lt’s
not as easy to
get a gun in
Virginia as
you might
think.” It was
all terribly en-
l i g h t e n i n g
and, at least
for a moment,
took my mind
off of the fact
that a shotgun
hanging from the ceiling on display
was pointed at my head.

My brother’s friend Jeff used to
describe being dragged by his parents
to various concerts and art museums as
“getting cultured.” He didn’t like it,
but like trips to the dentist, he knew it
was good for him. But there are some
forms of culture that might not seem
torturous at all. Blow off yourwork and
shoot pool, buy some cheap beer and
potato chips. Pick up some antique
pornography, then go hunting. Kelly’s
Comer is a cultural experience not to be
missed. It’s good for you.

Freshman elections garner many participants

By KELLEY Tornsu
Phi Staff Writer

Freshmen elections for the positions of Presi-
dent, Vice President, and Executive Committee
Representative will be held Monday, October
17 from 8 a.m. - 4 p.m. Election results will be
posted by 5:30 p.m.

Run—offs will take place Tuesday, October
25. These are usually necessary due to the large
number of candidates.

Listed below is each candidate’s name and
how he/she feels they can contribute to Wash-
ington and Lee throught their respective of-
fices. Freshmen can learn more about the can-
didates on Thursday, October 13. Speeches
begin at 7 p.m. in Lee Chapel. 1

Freshmen Presidential Candidates:

Pictures follow each quotation.

Chris Baldwin - “I am running for class
president because I have the leadership abilities
and experience to articulate the interests and
concerns of the freshmen class. If elected, I will
bring a healthy work ethic, a dependable pres-
ence and a judicious mind set to the office.“

 

Byron Burns - “I want to be more involved
on campus. People don’t always take me seri-
ously, but I am serious about this.”

 

Emily Giannini - “It’s a means to channel
my energy, enthusiasm, and creativity into ben-
eﬁting and uniting my class as a whole.”

 

Matthew Graves - “I have served on school,
state, and national leadership positions before,
and I feel I can be an effective leader for the
freshmen class.”

 

Vice-Presidential Candidates:

Laura-Ashley Allen - “I’m running for fresh-
man Vice-President because I love W&L and I
want to be actively involved in it. I know that I
can be fair and maintain honor as an officer on

the student conduct committee, the SCC, and I
also will get my class involved and make sure

their voices are heard.”

 

Tofer Harrison — “I want to get involved with
our school and my class and help us to have an
exciting year.”

 

Andrew Heron - “I’ll make a definite and
positive effect for my class and the college.”

 

Mary Jo Mahoney - “I am really interested in
getting involved in the class. I hope to increase
class unity and I can contribute fairness, time
and effort to the SCC.”

 

Jennifer Murphy — “I’m running for Vice-
President to get involved at W&L and in the
political processes here. I think I could contrib-

ute strong leadership and enthusiasm.”

 

E.C. Representatives:

Alex Christensen - “I am running because
all of the other candidates’ names sounded like
spy names and what I feel I can contribute is
restoring W&L’s freshmen class to peace, pros-
perity, and its historical position as a one world
superpower.”

 

Chris Condon — “I’m running because I’d
like to take an active role in decision making. I
think EC is very involved in the school and
what happens here, and I’d like to be a part of
that. I have a definite passion for the Honor
System - I can’t imagine going to school any-
where else.” V -

Elizabeth Detter - ‘‘I’m running for the EC
because I think that I’m an honest and consci-
entious person. I can offer a lot to the EC
because I am trustworthy.”

 

Gregory Scot Kees - “I deeply believe in the
values and traditions inherent in the honor“
system. For me the most natural expression of
my devotion to the honor system is to dedicate
myself to the service of those principles. Dili-
gence and perseverance. I can’t and won’t say
that I have more honor and integrity than any
other student; under the honor system we all
possess these qualities in equal measure. What
I can say is that I am willing to commit myself
to the defense of the honor system’s principles
and hopefullycan prove that I am worthy of the
faith of my classmates.”

 

Demian McGarry — “In addition to the EC
being an oversight for the honor code, it also
involves budget concerns. I feel I have the
expertise and know how to represent the fresh-
men class and keep the majority of the class’
interests in mind during the budget process.”

 

Kelly Monaghan - “I want to try and give
back to W&L as much as it has given to me.”

 

To All
Parents

Serving Washington & Lee Since 1926

Stephen Osborn - “All throughout elemen-
tary and high school, I chose to be a leader and
found it very gratifying to serve others. Now in
this new environment, I’m anxious to grow and
serve, giving as much as possible to W&L. l’ve
always tried to live with some integrity, fair-
ness, respect, and hopefully humility in mind;
therefore, I was naturally attracted to the EC
and its protection of the honor system and
students’ rights.

 

Andrew Ruppar - “I want to contribute to the
bond of trust and belief in personal responsibil-
ity that exists among W&L students. I feel that
by participating in a wide range of school
organizations and talking with students, I can
best represent their opinions in the budget hear-
ings on topics varying from club funding to
changes in the costs of student activities fees.”

 

Taylor Shultz - “I’m running for EC be-
cause, like many others, the authenticity of the
honor system was the deciding factor in my
decision to come here and I want to do every-
thing I can to uphold that tradition. I can con-
tribute by providing a freshman’s perspective,
one that is somewhat naive, idealistic, and
conservative, while at the same time open
minded. I wouldn’t be running if I wasn’t
prepared to commit my time and energy or if I
wasn’t committed to upholding honor in my
own life.”

 

Danielle Simonetta - “I didn’t have an honor
code at my school. I see how the power of
everything is in the the students’ hands. I know
it is time consuming, but I’m prepared to deal
with it and put my reputation on the line for the
honor code and W&L.“

Kirsten Smith - “I’m running because I
would like to get more involved in the school,
and I think they need more girls on the commit-
tee. I think it would be a great experience.”

 
 

Kyle Trivett - “The honor system is the
reason I chose W&L and I want to make sure it
is perpetuated. I think I am qualiﬁed because I
have a strong sense of honor.”

 

Miller Wild - “I graduated from a high
school that had an honor system very similar to
the one we have at W&L. I am very impressed
with the honor system here and it was one of the .
major inﬂuencing factors in my decision to
attend W&L. The honor system is an important
and unique aspect of W&L and I want to be a
part of the body that promotes and upholds the
honor system here.” —

Aaron Wilkinson carries the ball in one of W&L’s home games this season. The Generals have
not won yet in front of the home crowd, but they did pick up their first win of the season last

weekend against the Davidson Wildcats.

Men’s soccer hits winning streak

By ERIC SWENSEN
Phi Staff Writer

The Washington and Lee men’s soccer team, sparked by
a new offensive alignment and continued excellent play
from their defense, won twice last week to boost their record
to 5-4-1 (3-3 in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference).

After a 3-0 loss to Randolph-Macon on Homecoming
Saturday, head coach Rolf Piranian and assistant Tony
Corbett made some changes in the team’s lineup to try and
get more production from the offense. The debut of the new-
look offense came last Wednesday against Bridgewater.

The changes worked perfectly, as the Generals con-
trolled the game from the outset in a 6-1 thrashing. Shag
Drewry and David Corning scored goals in the ﬁrst half as
the Generals entered halftime with a 2-0 lead.

Golas from Meeker, Germain, Bill Gill, and Kevin
Hackian put the game out of reach in the second half. Si gler,
who moved from his normal defender spot to an outside
midﬁeld spot as part of the changes, contributed assists on

three of the ﬁrst four goals.

Sigler praised his team’s performance, saying, “it was
total domination by us. Both our offense and defense played
excellently.”

The new offense continued to pay dividends against
Dickinson on Saturday, as junior tri-captain Jeb Wofford
scored two goals to lead the Generals past Bridgwater by a
score of 3-1. Coach Piranian is pleased with the results of the
changes.

“It seems like something may be gelling because we have
seen some chemistry on the ﬁeld,” said the head coach.

With the regular season winding down and the ODAC
Tournament approaching, Si gler is pleased with the progress
the team has made this season.

“Our attitude has been consistently good throughout the
season,” sommented Sigler, “our offense has been steadily
improving all year, and our defense has been solid through-
out.”

The Generals played twice this week, taking on Lynchburg
yesterday and Virginia Wesleyan on Saturday at 2:00 PM up
at the Liberty Hall Fields.

By Scorr BOOKWALTER
Phi Staff Writer

One was the magic number for Washington and Lee last
weekend.

The Generals kicked their ﬁrst ﬁeld goal, scored their
first touchdown, took their ﬁrst lead, and won their ﬁrst
game of the 1994 season by holding off the Davidson
Wildcats by a count of 9-3 at Richardson Field in Davidson,
N.C. last Saturday.

The victory, W&L’s fourth straight in the state of North
Carolina, raised the team’s record to 1-3, and kept Davidson
winless at 0-4.

“I’m quite proud of the team,” commented head coach
Gary Fallon. “They wanted it (the victory) badly.”

Although the Generals were greatly aided by offensive
improvement, the name of the game remained defense for
the fourth straight contest. More precisely, the name was
Stuart Hogue.

The junior safety had the Wildcats seeing stars after
ravaging them for nine tackles and two interceptions. His
ﬁrst pick killed a first and goal opportunity for Davidson,
and the second, with slightly over a minute remaining,
clinched the win for the Generals. For his efforts, Hogue was
recognized as the Old Dominion Athletic Conference De-
fensive Player of the Week.

“Stuart’s a deserving young man,” Fallon said. “He’s had
two good games in a row now.”

Hogue’s comrade in the defensive backﬁeld, Marc
Newman, also delivered with a huge effort, collecting 12
tackles, including the ﬁrst sack of his college career.

The Generals scored its ﬁrst points since the September
10 contest with Emory and Henry on Drew Thomas’ 39-yard
field goal, salvaging a 3-3 halftime tie. The offense really
came alive in the third quarter though.

Junior James Urban jump started the drive by returning
a punt 32 yards to set up a W&L at the Davidson 18.

Freshman Seth McKinlev plowed in the end zone from

 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  

The W&L men’s soccer team has turned  on in their last few games

two yards out to give the Generals their ﬁrst taste of a lead
this seasonat 9-3 as the Wildcats blocked the extra point
attempt. McKinley rushed for 62 yards on 17 attempts as he
piloted the W&L rushing attack for a second straight week.

Quarterback Brooks Fischer turned in a solid afternoon
by completing 13 of 27 passes for 91 yards. Senior William
Propst hauled in seven of those passes, tying him for ﬁfth
place on the W&L all-time list.

The key to the victory for Washington and Lee was that
after bumbling their way to 14 turnovers in the ﬁrst three
games, they played the Davidson contest turnover-free.

“We didn’t turn the ball over like the ﬁrst three games,”
commented Fallon. “The offense stayed on the ﬁeld longer,
and was able to give the defense a good rest.”

The rest paid huge dividends late in the fourth quarter, as
W&L twice snuffed out Davidson threats.

After the Wildcats crept inside the Generals 25 with
under four minutes to play, the Generals stiffened, and
forced Davidson to turn the ball over on downs.

Proving this was no fluke, W&L rose to the occasion for

the ﬁnal time with less than two minutes remaining on I

Hogue’s clinching interception at the W&L 27.

The Generals return to Wilson Field for their ﬁnal two
home games, beginning this weekend against the Hampden
Sydney Tigers, who enter with a mark of 1-4.

Home ﬁeld advantage has proved to be a huge intangible
in this series, which the Tigers lead 26-23-2. The host school
has treated its fans to victory six times in the last seven years.

last season, the Tigers outscored the Generals 28-20 at
Hampden Sydney’s Hundley Stadium. This year, W&Lwill
have to contend with Robert Thompson, who checks in at
third in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference with 532
yards rushing.

Fallon hopes the team will continue to be ﬁred up this
Saturday, especially considering the fact that Parents’ Week-
end is here.

“lt’s an added attraction. The kids get pleasure out of .

playing in front of their parents,” the coach said. “The
parents are phenomenal; they treat the kids so well. I want
to see the parents happv.”

Are they
Worth it?

THE LAST Wom)
BY STEPHEN WILUARD

 

 

Will there ever be an
end to the amazing fea-
tures of professional
sports?

In the National Basket-
ball Association draft this
year, the Milwaukee Bucks
naturally tookjuniorGlenn
Robinson from Purdue
University. After all, he
was the most highly re-
garded player in the draft
and in college basketball
in general. ,

Now, after months of
contract squabbles and a
holdout, is it possible that
the lowly Bucks regret
their decision?

Robinson, a prop 48
player at Purdue (which
means he had to sit out a
year after failing to score a
700 on the SAT), comes
out after his junior year of
college and refuses to ac-
cept the offers of the Bucks.

If Milwaukee were of-
fering 4.25 an hour, I could
understandthis,butthelast
contract. the Robinson
ixnayed was a whopping
10-year, $70 million job.

I don’t know, I might
be the only one wondering
this, but WHAT is going
through this guys head
right now? Or an even bet-
ter question might be, is
anything going through
this guy’s head?

Actually, Robinson's
agent has decided that his
new buddy is worth a 13-
year deal that, with guar-
anteed raises every year,
would make Mr. Robinson
the first $100 million dol-
lar man in the NBA.

Mind you, thisniaii has
never played a ‘g'arrie’at the
NBA level and thirteen
years is a LONG time. How
many seasons did Michael
play?

And what about some
other college pheenoms
that wanted big bucks?
What is Ralph Sampson
doing now?

Like I said, maybe I’m
odd, but I just don’t see
how any rookie is worth
more than the team he plays
on. There is an easy way to
solve this problem. Turn
him down.

The Bucks should,
granted, at the loss of a #1
pick, bid Robinson a fond
farewell, hold onto his

W&Ltennis turns season into series of routs  

By KEITH GRANT
Phi Staff Writer

A team on a mission. A cli-
che, but that’s the best way to
describe the 1994-95 W&L
women’s tennis team.

After an early exit at last
spring’s Division III nationals
for the second-seeded team, the
Generals appear more deter-
mined, not to mention just a bit
more talented.

The team returns all but num-
ber-five singles player Kim
Dickinsonand has added four
solid freshmen.

“The team has improved quite
a bit,” said number-one singles
player Marilyn Baker. “We have
two starting freshmen who have
contributed immensely to the
team.”

Baker refers to Natalia Garcia,
21 Dominican native who plays at
number—two, and Erica Shapard
at number-ﬁve. Those two were
among the four W&L players
who made up the entire semiﬁnal
ﬁeld at the Rolex Southeast Re-
gional tournament two weeks
ago.

Baker, a senior, beat Garcia
for a repeat singles title. The pair
then joined to win the doubles

championship, defeating a Mary
Washington team of Beth Todd
and Kirsten Erickson 6-3, 6-2. It
marked the second straight year
W&L swept the two titles.

The victory in the singles ﬁ-
nal gave Baker the W&L career
record for wins with 75. The two-
time All-American now owns a
career mark of 78-11.

Junior Shelley Sunderrnan and
Shapard rounded out the all-Gen-
erals singles ﬁnal four. W&Lalso
claimed three semiﬁnal spots in
doubles competition, with teams
of Julie Ayers-Carrie Lucas and
Shapard-Anna O’Connor mak-
ing the ﬁnal four.

With the singles and doubles
regional titles, Baker and Garcia
earned a trip to the Rolex Na-
tional Small College Champion-
ships in Edmond, Oklahoma later
this month.

As if their dominance at Rolex
was not enough, the Generals
trounced a pair of Division II
squads last weekend. W&L beat
Wingate and Longwood by 8-1
scores.

The lone loss each time was a
forfeit at number-one doubles due
to an injury to Sunderman. The

junior did participate in singles
and picked up a pair of wins as
Washington & Lee did not lose a

  

set in either match.

With all the key returnees,
including Ayers at number-three
singles and Sundennan at four,
and the additions of freshmen
Garcia, Shapard, Lucas, and
Berry Blankinship, the team is
well stacked with talent.

However, last year’s Division
III nationals taught them that tal-
ent is often not enough.

“There’s been a definite
change in attitude,” Baker said.
“We now realize that talent alone
is not enough. It takes a lot of
hard work and determination.”

Another cliche, another truth.

According to Baker, the team
has concentrated very hard on
their doubles play. In singles, she
feels the team matches up with
any in Division III. Their doubles
play, though, has required some
extra work, particularly at the
net.

They will surely be tested next
weekend at the Old Dominion
University Athletic Tournament
in Norfolk. Many Division I
schools are expected to compete,
including Virginia, William &
Mary and Richmond.

“I think we’ll represent our-
selves well,” Baker remarked.
“It will certainly be a challeng-
mg experience.”

 Women’s soccer continues strong

BY JOSHUA HESLINGA
Phi Staff Writer

Unstoppable may be the only word to
describe the Washington and Lee
women’s soccer team and their fab fresh-
man forward Erica Reineke over this
past week’s games.

After rebounding from their disap-
pointing loss to Randolph-Macon with a
5-1 win last Wednesday over Sweet
Briar, the Generals dominated Guilford
Saturday by an identical margin to im-
prove to 4-2 in the ODAC, 6-3 overall.

After having seniors Anne Spruill
and Kait Barton team up to knock out
Sweet Briar, it was the turn of the team’s
freshmen on Saturday.

Reineke insured her place in W&L
sports lore by scoring the first two goals
of the game, her 11th and 12th of the
season, shattering the previous school
record ten goals with four games left in
the regular season to pad her record.

The record was far from Reineke’s
mind, however, as she said, “I wasn’t
even thinking about it. I didn’t even
know about it till after the game, so I
deﬁnitely wasn’t thinking about it at
all.”

When asked about future goals, she
became even more hesistant, saying, “I
don’t know. I didn’t expect to break
either record, so I can’t even think to-

freshman Delia Coyle, who moved from
her midﬁeld spot to goalie for injured
goalie Beth Mozena for the 3rd time this
season.

The status on Mozena has been re-
ported as day -to—day, and Coach Hathom
privately remarked, “It doesn’t look
good.”

But Hathorn remained optimistic
about the rest of the season, saying,
“Delia’s doing a great job. At this point,
she’s gaining more experience, so it’s
possible Beth’s absence won’t hurt us at
all.”

As for the team’s other injury, that of
sophomore striker Michelle Bauman,
nursing an injured ankle after recording
seven goals and seven assists for the
Generals this season, Coach Hathom
offered a positive prognosis, saying,
“She’s healing rapidly. It’s much fur-
theralong than we thought it would be at
this point. We expect her for Saturday
[vs. Swarthmore], but Thursday [vs.
Roanoke] is up in the air.”

Any reﬂection on what has been ac-
complished the last few games has to be
overwhelmingly upbeat.

Co-captain Anne Spruill credited the
team’s cohesion, saying, “I think the
team’s been playing as a team, which is
what makes us play well. We’ve had
games where we haven’t played well in
the ﬁrst half, and we’ve been able to pull

ers for maturity in handling the balance
of athletics and academics, observing, “I
think the thing that’s most positive is that
we’ve been ready to play at our level,
especially with such busy weeks aca-
demically. The reality of W&L academ-
ics and athletics is that they have to be
integrated. When you have students that
want to give all of themselves to both,
you’re going to have problems. I think
they’re handling this in a very respon-
sible and very mature manner. Because
we give so much to the academics, some-
times it is soccer that they come to dead
tired, and we need to ﬁgure out how to
play in spite of that. I like that relation-
ship- it’s not something I wish wasn’t
that way, but it’s a reality of the situation
here.”

Looking ahead, the team faces two
home games this week, against Roanoke
and Swarthmore.

Spruill identiﬁed focus as the key,
remarking, “I think we just need to focus.
We’ve got the skill and we’re in shape-
we just need to focus on what we want to
do.

Coach Hathom agreed, adding, “We
always need to get better, but I think it
[the key] is two things: 1) continuing to
play our style of soccer, even when we’re
ﬁred up and playing a big team, and 2)
when we’re in a big game, knowing how
to win it, how to play enough defense so

this guy, and every other
holdout for that matter.

These people have the
bare minimum of skills
necessary to compete in
the workplace.

For example, Robinson
couldn’t even get a 700 on
his SAT. You get some-
thing like 200 points on
that test just for signing
your name! You tell me
where this guy is going to
end up working without
basketball.

The idea of a rookie
having a deal out for more
than the team is worth
seems absurd at best. There
have always been bright
starscomingintctheNBA,
but in the past few years,
the money that has been
laid on the table for some
of the best and the bright-
est has skyrocketed.

All over the league,
rookie contracts are going
through the roof. Every
year, now, the first ques-
tion asked during the draft
isn’t how will so-and-so
gel with our guys, but will
he sign with us, and how
much will we have to shell
out to have a chance.

There is no reason why
a 21 year old should be
bossing around the entire
league. After all, basket-
ball is all that separates
people like Glenn
Robinson from, “Can I take
your order, please?”

For another week, we remain
perturbed by the non—existent 95 —
96 National Hockey League sea-
son.

The authors are especially dis-
appointed because the worst team
in hockey (the Rangers) have
been decimated by injuries and
the longer the strike wears on,
the more Broadway Blues will
return to the ice.

Yet we still anxiously await
the return of the Devils and Fly-
ers.
This weekend included an in-
tense NFC matchup of the Phila-
delphia Eagles and Washington
Redskins. Despite the poor record
Washington brought into the
game, they gave the Super Bowl
contending Mean Green a battle,
falling short 21-17.

The inconsistent and inexpe-
rienced Heath Shuler threw two
touchdown passes, but failed to
complete many passes. On the
other hand, Randall “Scramble”
Cunningham lived up to his name
by performing a ﬂip into the end
zone to record 6 points.

The Eagles now face their
arch-rivals, the Dallas Cowboys.
The underdog Cowboys must
subdue the NFC’s highest rated
offensive attack to stay in the
game.

I (Tory) will be the first to
admit that the Giants played a
wretched game of football. The
Big Blue looked good in the ﬁrst
half, especially due to Dave

which resulted in a TD.

Unfortunately the second half
was abysmal. Brown burst the
Giants’ bubble by throwing an
INT that was returned for a TD
(just like last week against the
Aints).

From then on, the game was
not worth watching. (By the way
the NJ Giants lost to the Vikes)
On good note, Giants return man
Lewis was a shining star.

Also the half time ceremony
which honored the greatest de-
fensive player ever, Lawrence
“LT” Taylor, will never be for-
gotten. His speech, although
short, touched the hearts of not
only Giants fans, but all football
fans. (This is only the eighth num-
ber to be retired in the Giants 70
year history). ‘

In a bitter AFC East match-
up, the inferior Miami Fins were
harpooned by the Northern stam-
pede of the Bills.

Thurman Thomas’ return
from injury showed that he had
not lost a step, as he trampled
over the hapless Fish.

The Dallas (bandwagon team)
Cowboys were victorious in-
theirshowdownwith Buddy Ball.
The Arizona quarterbacks threw
ﬁve interceptions, proving that
Buddy Ryan’s emphasis on de-
fense is costly to the over-all
TEAM concept.

The San Diego Chargers con-
tinue to impress as they electro-
cuted the Kansas City Chiefs, led
by Joe Montana ( a QB no longer
in his prime). We’ll keep our

THIS IS NO HV!!! Although
Jack Trudeau once again showed
his incompetence by playing at
the top of his game, Boomer
“Lame Duck” Esiason managed
to coral the India-no place Colts.

The Falcs and the Niners both
won, setting up a key NFC West
matchup on Sunday. The play-
ers to watch will be Deion Sand-
ers and Andre Rison.

The winner of this game stands
the best chance to challenge the
NFC East powerhouse for the
right to go to Miami in January.

On the college side, Notre
Dame faltered again. Unfortu-
nately this loss to the upstart
Boston College Eagles will put
them out of National Title con-
tention.

Two such contenders include
the Penn State Nittany Lions and
the Michigan Wolverines, who
meet in Ann Arbor this Saturday.
The winner will be the team most
likely to take the now defunct
Wisconsin Badgers’ Rose Bowl
crown.

The Hurricanes of Miami
stormed over the Seminoles of
FSU, in the battle of the Sun-
shine State.

Last night was the home
opener for the Roanoke Express.
We hope all of W&L’s hockey
faithful have ordered tickets in
advance for this promising sea-
son of southwestern Virginia
hockey.

Our magic eight ball says, “It
is certain” that the Express will
have a great season. Slates.

This past weekend was a

During those two games,
Coyle allowed only two goals

VOLUME 94, NO. 7

Heatley judge
may dismiss

By SARAH GILBERT
Phi Executive Editor

Counsel for Nathan Rick Heatley
surprised Washington and Lee
University’s lawyers in the most recent
bout of the $1 million wrongful dis-
charge lawsuit with a clause from the
Virginia Code which Heatley’s law-
yers think should “create a new cause
of [tort] action.” ‘

Part of the Code’s purpose is to
“protect citizens of the Commonwealth
against unfounded charges of unlawful
discrimination” (§2.1-715). Charles
Smith III, Heatley’s attorney, intro-
duced this portion of the Code into his
oral argument in the first hearing in
Covington Oct. 19.

In other words, Heatley’s lawyers
are seeking to establish a precedent in
this case which would allow employ-
ees to sue their employers if they be-
lieved they had been fired as a result of
a charge of sexual harassment which
had not been proven.

Alleghany Circuit Court Judge
Duncan Byrd is considering the argu-
ment presented by Smith in defense of
Washington and Lee’s motion for de-
murrer. That means that W&L eon-
tended that, though the facts Heatley
presented may have been true, they
did not support his premise of
wrongful discharge.

Heatley was fired from his position
asdirected of Career Developmentand
Placement in May of 1 993 after Beverly
Lorig and Ruth Lewis claimed that
Heatley had sexually harassed them,

for judgment.

Heatley is suing the University for
punitive and compensatory damages
totaling $1 million on the basis of six
different counts, including wrongful
discharge,whichisthecenterofW&L’s
motion for demurrer.

Heatley contends that he should not
have been dismissed without being
found guilty of sexual harassment in a
university investigation.

His lawyers state that the student
handbook constitutes a contract with
the faculty in regards to due process in
the investigations ofsexual harassment,
since no other provisions for this sort
of problem exist. I

If Judge Byrd decides to grant the
motion for demurrer, the case will
be dismissed.

One of W&L’s attorneys, Leanne
Shanks, ﬁled a letter in opposition to
Heatley’s lawyers oral argument
Oct. 25.

She called the causeofaction Smith
would like to create a “runaway tort”
that would do “irreparable damage.”
As part of her defense, she cited an-
other part of the Virginia Code.

“Nothing in this chapter creates,
nor shall it be construed to create, an
independent or private cause of action
to enforce its provision, nor shall poli-
cies or provisions of thischapter be
construed to allow tort actions to be
instituted instead of or in addition to

Freshman election
results tabulated

By MICHAEL Hl:ZWLE'l'l‘
I’/ii Staff Writer

The freshmen can look forward to a class
party as one of the goals of their new elected
representatives.

Freshmen run-off elections were held
on Tuesday.

The results are as follows: Chris Baldwin,
Class President; Mary Jo Mahoney, Class Vice-
Prcsident; and Taylor Sluiltz, Executive Com-
mittcc Rcprcscntative.

Baldwin said the
class party was one of
the ways he wanted to
get freshmcn more in-
volved with activities
on campus.

The party is tenta-
tively scheduled atthe
end of the year.

Mahoncysaidthey
will work closely with
the Freshmen Leader-
ship Council.

Tnc president and
vice-president will re-
vicw cases brought
before the Student
Conduct Committee.

Baldwin said he

. fclt honored and ex-

cited about being
clcctcd. and he looked for\vard to serving the
class as president.

“l‘ expect a lot of participation from a strong
frcshmcn class.“ he said, “and I personally
expecttoworkhardaspresidcntinfulfillingthe

, obligation which the office requires.”

Shultz

Baldwin said he ran for office because he
had the leadership abilities as well as the coin-
mitment to successfully lead the class. Baldwin
said he found a friendly atmosphere at Wash-
ington and Lee University. He was most im-
pressed by the Honor System.

“I saw a good deal of cheating in high
school,” Baldwin said, “and I wanted an atmo-
sphere where no one received an unfair advan-
tagc in academic competition.”

Mahoney agreed.

“You can feel like you can trust everybody
at the school.” she said.

Another woman described being as much

Clinton begins Mideast Peace Tour

President Clinton arrived in Cairo Wednesday to begin a six-nation
tourto promote peace in the Middle East. Clinton gathered with 5000 other
dignitaries near the Jordan-Israel border to watch the signing of the peace
treaty between those two countries. The President’s visit comes after
recent terrorist attacks in the Middle East, leading to heightened security
concerns.

Russian oil spill worse than Exxon Valdez

A ruptured pipeline leaked two million barrels of oil into the Russian
Arctic. Ofﬁeials say the leak was months old, but a dam placed to contain
the leak burst in the past few days. The hot oil soaked the permafrost and
posed potential environmental damage to the area. The volume of the spill
is approximately eight times that of the Exxon Valdez spilled in Alaska in
1989.

Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide selected a Prime Minister

Specialists from the World Health Organization investigating the
Indian outbreak of pneumatic plague recommended relaxing restrictions
on travellers into the country. The team said that New Dehli, Bombay,

Chavis settles with NAACP

The Rev. Benjamin Chavis has agreed to withdraw his suit against the V ‘V

civil rights organization which he formally led. The agreement falls short
of Chavis’ original demand of payment until his three-year contract was

August, after the group’s board dismissed him for settling a sexual
harassment complaint with the board’s money.

Houston channel reopens

The Houston Ship Channel reopened Monday after crews removed a
sunken tugboat and ensured no flood debris was blocking the port.
Flooding caused the channel to close a week ago. Officials say swirling
wateror debris caused at least four pipelines to rupture, leading to ﬁres that
burned on the water. The cleanup has cost up to $3.5 million, coming from
the Federal Oil Pollution Trust Fund.

he did a defense plea to release Simpson on bail and delay the trial.

A Florida judge on Wednesday barred the Clinton Administration
from turning over a group of detained refugees to Havana. The refugees

rest went to local relief organizations
such as the Blue Ridge Food Bank.
Brotzman said this year all the money
raised will go to local organizations.

She said people are more likely to
contribute ifthey know the money will
go to local efforts. She said local
grassroots efforts are more efficient.

Craun agreed.

“Money is going in the best eco-
nomical way for people who need it,”
he said.

“lt’s a very direct way for students
and faculty to help by coming to the
reading and contributing.”

Brotzman said fewer writers are
reading from their work this year. Last
year six people read whereas this year
only five people are reading. She said
they wanted to give the readers more
time.

“There seems to be just a lot of
talent in thejunior and senior writers,”

she said, “and we just wanted to
showcase it.”Brotzman was impressed
with student interest in the arts.

“There’s a greater interest in liter-
ary events here in recent years,” he
said, “and that accounts for the popu-
larity of the Writers Harvest last year
and the poetry readings the Society for
the Arts have had.”

Senior Ashlie Kauffman said last
year’s Writers Harvest seemed very
professional and drew many people
from the community.

“lt’s a Hands Across America thing
but we’re not holding hands,” she said.

Andrews said she will read two nar-
rative poems, a new one and a pub-
lished poem. She said if writers can
attract an audience for a larger cause,
it’s a positive.

“lt’s the first time l’ve done some-
thing like this,” she said, “l think typi-
cally writers are solitary people with a
social conscience.

“This is the first time when those
two parts of myself can be
in harmony.”

PILSA sparks interest

Law Notes

Law professors work on research

projects

The brand new Public interest Law Students Associa-

tion has made an immediate impact on the Law School
campus. Just a month old, this association has signed up
one fifth of the law school as members, and has already
hosted a panel discussion and conducted an extremely
successful fund-raiser during Parent‘s Weekend.

in early October, PILSA led a number of student
groups in bringing to W&L a broadcast of “First Mon-
day,” a celebration of public interest law including such
areas as government prosecuting, public defending, and
Legal Aid, which provide counsel to those unable to
afford any.

A panel discussion followed, with a number of law
professors, a law student, and a local Legal Aid lawyer
discussing their work. answering questions and discuss-
ing the benefits of working in the public interest sector.
One of the benefits was the feeling of satisfaction they
got for helping someone with legal affairs who may
otherwise be left out in the cold.

Pl LSA also ran an extremely successful fund-raiserat
the football game on |’arent’s Weekend, working the
concessions during the game and earninga I5 percent cut
of the proceeds. This money will be put in the bank and

A numberofprofessors at the Law School have or are
currently working on research projects outside their
teaching duties. The projects include research on copy-
right laws as related to the Information Superhighway
and the Internet, preparation for an improved course in
Elder Law, which specializes in legal issues concerning
the elderly, such as age discrimination, housing, and
Medicare, and recommendations on how to reconcile
conflicting portions ofthe Americans with Disabilities
Act and the National Labor Relations Act.

Reading days: party or study hall?

By .lt-:sst('A /\N't'()Nl(‘ll
I’/Ii Staff Writer

Reading days. were they used for
theiroriginal intent orasjust an excuse
to party‘? Professors and students have
vcr_v differingopinions on the pros and
Cons of Washington and l.ee’s first
fall break.

Most students agreed that the break
was more than beneficial totheir health
and their sclioolwork. it gave them a
much needed L‘ll:lllCt' to catch up on
sleep and the work Ihcy‘ve been put-
ting off for the first six weeks of the
tcrtn. .|unior Dani Wong said although
in _vears past she‘s been too busy to
notice the toll that ten weeks without a
break had taken on her. this year was a
nice change. She stayed in Lexington,
and like many other students, didn’t
get very much reading done. Fresh-
man Sara l\lc(icorge also'staycd in
Lexington but had the chance to visit a
few fr_icnds over the prolonged week-
end. Like Dani. Slit‘ t_lit|n"t do much
work but had the good excuse that she
didn't lniye much to do. She said she
did see one problem with the reading

days, and it was the fact that a lot of
students didn’t show up to their
Wednesday classes. She said a few of
her professors were upset and claimed
this would be the end ofthe fall break.
Jen Brady. a freshman from New Jer-
sey. got the chance togo home and visit
with her family. She felt, as a freshman
at the beginning of the year. it would
have been horrible to have to wait until
Thanksgiving fora break.

Mixed rcvie\vs are coming in from
the administration. Dean Peppers‘ sec-
retary has heard quite positive remarks
from students who finally got a chance
to catch up on work and believes that
most people used Thursda_v and Friday
to work and treated the \veckcnd nor-
mally. l-lowcvcr. from what she hears.
the professors are rather ambivalent.
Some think that it was a positive expe-
rience while other professors feel that
students just used it as another excuse
to party longer.

ProfessorRushtookthe readingdays
as an opportunity to grmle papers. He
said although it was a nice break it
wasn‘t particulary ncccss try and won-
ders if students took time to actually

read during the break. in response to
the complaint that students have to go
ten weeks without a break during fall
term. he said. "That’s the price you
have to pay for spring term.”
Professor Hall was a little iuore
positive about the reading days and
said he thinks "students need this break
in order to put their studies into per-
spective and catch their breath.”
l)avid Howison. Dean ofStudents.
said two years ago he suggested a break
ofonly one day but it was voted down
by the faculty. The next time they
proposed a two day break and it was
approved by a 2to I vote. Even though
some are opposed. the reading days

- will happen next year because they

were voted into the schedule before
this year's break. in Howison’s opin-
ion, the reading days have achieved
many of the goals the administration
had hoped for and it was a good break
in the hectic academic life of a
W&Lstudcnt.

lle cmphasi7.es the point that the
concept of reading days will be re-
evaluated in the future. but he is opti-
mistic that thcy \\ ill continue.

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897 A

60/40: No complaints here

All things considered, we at The R."/lzg-tum Phi actually
support the 60-40 ratio which has been under fire so much
recently.

Aside from the surface response to the question, Should we
keep the (>0-40 ratio‘? (that being, “Well....why the heck not?”),
there are many solid reasons to keep it ll: place.

First, it seems to be a very convincing and effective way of
compromising between those who would eschew the value of
tradition at Washington and Lee University and those who insist
that women are necessary to raise the qua‘ ity of the members of
the stude.nt body. We would agree with both sides of the
argument and with the compromise; the high ranking and name
recognition brought tnost ofus here, tradition keeps us here, and
the quality of the student body will hopefully send us out to more
and better jobs than any single-sex school would have.

Second, it seetns to reflect some ofour nest heritage. In 1973
(when most of this year’s seniors were born), a student referen-
dum was taken, and 59 percent were in favor ofcoeducation and
41 percent were opposed. There is nothing like upholding the
strange and prophetic cycles of history.

Third, the social balance that has been s‘ ruck with the existing
ratio seems to be working wonderfully. I have seldom heard
anyonecomplain of a lack of available males or females. What
seems to be a common complaint at many much larger schools
is never heard at Washington and Lee. The formal functions
which proliferate at W&L are always populated heavily and
almost exclusively by couples. There is reither a lack ofavail-
able "dates“ nor a lack of interest in social functions which
require them.

The arguments against an uneven ratio seem to be rather
random. Certainly. it ismoredifficultfor twoman to getinthan
it is for an equally qualified man; but it is also more prestigious
for a woman (who is probably smarter than her male competi-
tors) to win an election or gain a position of leadership and to
simply graduate. No one complains that l larvard is discrimina-
tory because it is easier for, say, Native American females than
equally qualified white anglo-saxon Prctestant males to gain
admittance. Because W&L women are, on the tnathematical
average. about 33 percent smarter than W&L men, does that hurt
either the women or the men? The men get the benefit of higher
rankings and brighter classmates to “help them study” and the
women can feel superior and find it easier to break into leader-
ship roles.

Overall. the findings ofthe Co—educatit in Review Committee
were based upon a body of evidence which was, though well-
researched. somewhat superficial and definitely did not reflect
the opinions of even St) percent ofthe unbalanced student body.

60-40. We like it. l..et’s keep it the way it is.

Where have all the Puritans gone?

     

NICHOLAS L.
WADDY, ’96

It has always been patriotic to say
that America was founded by men and
women dedicated to the principles of
liberty and toleration. We have always
liked to think of ourselves as harbin-
gers of enlightenment, bringing de-
mocracy and equality to all the world.
But this is only partly true. There is
another side to America — one which
these days we commonly like to forget.
The fact is that the first Americans
were not Lockean philosopher-plant-
ers, but Puritans — tough, uncompro-
mising, fire-and-brimstone Calvinists.
They believed unquestioningly in their
Bible and in their way of life, and they
generally stoned anyone else
who didn’t.

Where the common folk of America
were not necessarily Puritans, they were
often conservative Christians of some
other stripe. The point being that the
pioneer myth — that all early Ameri-
cans were really just rugged individu-
alists, wanting just to be left alone — is
false. America, for most of its
history, has been made up ofsmall,
cohesive, and often exclusive and
judgmental Christian communities.

All this, we are understandably
tempted to think, is mere history. The
Puritan ethos has been lost. To a large

extent this is true. But trappings re-
main: America is still vastly more con-
servative on issues of sexual morality
than most European countries (depress-
ing as this fact may seem); this anomaly
can be largely credited to our prim
Calvinist forbears.

And ironically, one of the most bi-
zarre forms of mass communication
prevalent in the United States today,
the so-called Talk Show, is itself a dim
reﬂection of the moral absolutism of
ages past. Talk Shows provide Ameri-
cans, who have lost their old sense of
belonging to any small community, the
opportunity to participate in a
larger, nationwide community of
moral superiors.

One imagines that the gossiping and
frequent displays of moral indignation
that can now be glimpsed daily on
Geraldo or Sally Jessy, would 100 years
ago have taken place in the course of a
tea party in a Victorian parlor, or 300
years ago might have involved a pil-
lory or some kind of water torture. The
deep desire to be part of a morally
superior clique, to showers corn on
the indecent, never disappears, though
its techniques may shift.

The conclusion many Americans
have reached, whether they admit it or
not, is that this legacy of Christian
parochialism is something to be over-
come. The libertarian dream of a pub-
lic order untainted by prejudice, tradi-
tion, or — gasp! —— by religion is
widely popular. Let reason and tolera-
tion be our guides; after all, when you
get right down to it, those Puritans

could be quite mean. And in a
diverse society like ours, isn’ta
concept like “shared values”
doomed to become a code word
for oppression?

We should remember,l think, that
without shared values no community
is possible. If there are no assumptions
that can be taken for granted, if there
is truly no common ground in
America, than we are ultimately justa

live in a community where we belong,
where we feel comfortable, and where
others think like we do. This attitude is
precisely what cosmopolitan, liberal-
minded modemists believe leads to
war, division, and hatred. They are

. right. But the instinct of men to segre-

gate themselves into homogeneous
groups —— groups in which they feel
they “belong” — must be recognized
and dealt with. It does not always need

mish-mash of people who cannot to be a burden; it can, as I mentioned,
dare to be a

MY VIEW

Michael Hewlett, '96

Everytime I turn around I see the name Charles Murray. The New York
Magazine called him the most dangerous conservative. Newsweek and The New
Republic have cover stories on him. Who is this Charles Murray and why should
we care? Charles Murray came into prominence a few years ago when he
published Losing Ground. In this book he linked out-of-wedlock births to an
expanding welfare state. He called for the abolishment of welfare for -teen-ager
girls who have illegitimate children. He believed this would discourage young
girls fron1 having children out-of-wedlock. How he thinks ending welfare is
going to solve the problem is beyond me. Simplistic in conception, ending
welfare would cause more problems than it would solve. He is again causing
controversy with his new book, The Bell Curve. He co-wrote it with the late
Richard J. Hermstein. Among other things they tackle supposed racial differ-
ences between blacks and whites.

Murray and Hemrstein believe intelligence plays
a signiﬁcant role in dctennining success. In other
words, if you have a low IQ, you will probably not
see the insides of corporate America—much less
the insides of a college dorm. They argue that this
applies to groups and not individuals. They contend
that society is divided into the cognitive elite and the
dim-witted underclass. In a highly technological
society, the gap between the cognitive elite and the
underclass becomes wider.

One might ask: what about environment? Murray
and Hemnstein contend that intelligence plays a

intelligence scores

inferiority as an excuse to rationalize slavery and segregation. If blacks were
dumb, then it made sense to civilize them through slavery. Now, Murray and
Herrnstein are bringing up this dark sludge again. This is pseudoscience on the
same level as eugenics in the early 20th century.

When I first heard of Murray’s ideas, I dismissed them. When I mulled over
them for some time, I still dismissed them. It just doesn’t make sense to me.

Maybe I do have a low IQ or maybe Murray is wrong. I’ve known plenty of people i

with high IQ’s who don’t succeed. Some of them happen to attend W&L. What
determines how far one goes is education-—not just intelligence. Who would
have thought that Albert Einstein would become a Noble Prize winning pysicist.
Not his teachers. He made D’s and F’s when he was in school. Today, people laud
him as a genius.

What type of environment do children grow up in? What about motivation?
Don’t these also affect how successful people are? There are other types of
intelligence such as common sense, or practical intelligence. Common sense can
hurt "a person’s chances of success just as much as IQ——maybe even more.
Certainly, IQ does play a role. IQ does determine success and failure. The
question is: Does it play as large a role as Murray and
Hemnstein contend? No. There are too many other
things that impact one’s success. Even if one makes it
to college, there is no guarantee that he will gradu-
ate—whether he has a high IQ or not. To say that IQ
plays so large a role in determining life chances is
making a mockery out of common sense. They are
saying that ifyou have a low IQ, you will end up in the
underclass. Nature is ﬁxed. Welfare, remedial educa-
tion for underprivileged children, and affirmative
action should be abolished because they will do little
to improve the life chances of poor people. He is
telling black children that they are on average less

much larger role than either environment or socio-
economic status. High IQs mate with other high
IQs, producing children with high IQs. That would
make sense. I would prefer to mate with an intelligent woman as opposed to a
really dumb bimbo. However, their other arguements lose credibility. What they
are essentially saying is this: Poor people are poor because they are stupid.

Unfortunately, our dear Mr. Murray and Mr. Herrnstein do not stop there.
They also believe that black people are stupid, too. According to them, blacks
score 15 points lower on IQ tests than whites. Recent research has indeed
established this 15 point difference as fact. How much genes account for this
difference is still debatable. They qualify this racial difference by saying that 10
percent of the black population are smarter than 50 percent of the white
population. Still, their main point is that black people are intellectually inferior
to whites.

For some strange reason, sweet thoughts of Hitler enter my head. He thought
blacks and Jews were dumb. What did Hitler do? Well, he decided to eliminate
six million Jews, gypsics and homosexuals. In America, racists used black

intelligent than whites. What is to stop them from
saying, ‘‘I’m dumb.Why should I try?”

Our wonderful authors argue that their findings
should not put too much of a chill in peoples’ hearts. “lnstcad, we are saying a
good word for a certain kind ofethnocentrism. Given a chance, each clan will add
up its accomplishments using its own weighting system, will encounter the world
with confidence in its own worth and, most importantly, will be unconcerned
about its accomplishments line-by-line with those ofany other clan. This is wise
ethnocentrism.” I see. Blacks should not be concerned that they are intellectually
inferior. Whites should not assume that every black they meet has a lower IQ than
them. It would be nice to believe that these pseudoscientiﬁc findings will not
affect blacks or whites. Unfortunately, history teaches us differently. Murray and
Herrnstein boast ofthcir courage in talking about this taboo subject. They cover
themselves in statistics, graphs, and doubletalk. They attempt to cast themselves
as saddened but hardened men only seeking to tell the truth. Therc’s only one
problem: Murray and Herrnstein wouldn’t know the truth. Maybe their IQ’s are
too low to recognize it.

tie and sequins?” That’s also what I
tell my parents.

It so happens that some of the best
costumes are those that you can make
at home, or get out of your parents’
closet. For those of you with neither
homesvnor parents, here’s my list of
suggestions:

1) Drop by your local thrift shop
and pick up a pair of size 49 wide
overalls. Take them home and put
them on,thenstuffyourselfwith news-
papers (I suggest The Rockbridge
Weekly), and “voila,” you are fat for
Halloween! This is assuming you are
not already size 49 wide before you
get dressed.

2) Nothing could be better than the
tried-and-true deranged Stop-ln con-
venience store worker. You can dis-
pe nse chili from your pockets to your
party guests.

3) Letitia Pate Evans.

Halloween is also a unique time
for the Speaking Tradition. Instead of
saying “hello” to passersby, it is ac-
ceptable to say “Boo.” You can also
wear all the clothes that have been
gathering underneath your bed. When
people ask you about the Cobwebs,
just tell them, “Hey, l’mjust trying to
spread a little Halloween cheer; what’s
your problem?”

And one last thing — you might
want to drop by Kelly’s Corner soon.

THE FAR MIDDLE

Alex Christensen

This is a new column. It will not be based on the
conservative world view and it will not be based on
the liberal world view. It will be based on what I think.
.’My name is Alex Christensen. I carry a badge.

People often ask mewhether I am a Democrat or
a Republican. This makes sense, since I am a dues-
paying member of both the College Republicans and
the College Democrats. Ronald Reagan and Bill
Clinton spring to mind when you ask me who were the
best presidents of the last thirty-five years.

So I have tried to come up with a few descriptive
labels to quickly identify my politics to people.
~‘.‘Goldwater Democrat” is one, “Militant Moderate——
«I don’t agree with liberals or conservatives, but I am

convinced I’m right” is anoth"er;..But‘1he-’nam‘e of the '

column, “The Far Middle,” seems to-~ be the most
understandable to people. One word of caution. What
you read here may not always be accurate, but it’s all
true. And so:

Today’s episode: On the Trail with Pat
Buchanan.

The great thing about Virginia, just like when I
used to live in Idaho, is that the politics is so acces-
sible. I’ve been to local Republican and Democratic
events all over Rockbridge County and I’ve only been
here for a few weeks. Picnics, strategy and organiza-
tional meetings, parties, rallies——it’s amazing.

Two weekends ago I went to what I thought would
be a quaint local Virginia event called a “pig-pickin’”
(on the engraved invitations) which doubled as a
fund-raiser for local Congressman Bob Goodlatte,
‘77L. Congressman Goodlatte is running unopposed,
so I wasn’t quite sure why he needed to have a fund-
raiser, but hey, if you can’t trust your congressman,
who can you trust? But what really reeled me and my
fifteen bucks in was the barbecue—and the fact that
Pat Buchanan would be the headline attraction.

I rode up to the event with some good Rockbridge
County Republicans. We parked the car, got out, paid
our cash, and then basically stood around waiting
for Buchanan to show.

After about a half of an hour schmoozing in the
searing wind, a big white monster truck with four-
foot tires and orange lightning bolts zipping down
the sides roared up. The Stars and Bars were ﬂying
proudly on the antenna. In the bed of the truck
was a bluegrass band playing “Shenandoah.”

The boys in the band played for about five more
minutes, then all but one slapped on their Ray-
Bans, checked theirsidearms, and scrambled down
out of the truckbed.

The last guy set outatree stump in front of the
main microphone and his voice bellowed out over
the loudspeaker, “Ladies and gentlemen, a true
warlord in the battle for the soul of America—
Patrick J. Buchanan of Chantilly, Virginia!”

The crowd went crazy, clapping, whistling and
stamping their feet with glee. The Bluegrass Boys
uncomfortably but professionally scanned the
crowd for signs of danger. A couple of them were

‘eyeing the, probabilybecausevl was eyeing them, so.

I quickly turned with the rest of the audience and
stared in rapt attention at the ﬁgure stepping up
onto the stump.

At first I wasn’t even sure it was Buchanan. He
was sort of stooped over and was wearing a black
velvet cape. He opened his mouth to speak, and I
was momentarily bafﬂed. Apparently he was wear-
ing some of those cheap novelty-store vampire
teeth and he was cackling maniacally.

“Thish ish how we shcare those liberals!” he
yelled. “Nashty, nashty liberals!” He mugged and
vamped and the crowd went wild.“That’s right,
he’s got it, they oughta be scared,” said a man
in the crowd. “They oughta be scared, all right.” He
spit on the ground and laughed.

Buchanan stopped and smiled, then winked,
threw offthe cape and took the sopping teeth out of
his mouth. A couple ofthe Boys rushed up to catch
it all and one of them took the teeth and secreted
them in an inside pocket. Buchanan straightened
up and laughed, his eyes crinkling in that inimi-
table way familiarto viewers of CNN’s “Crossﬁre”
across the nation.

“That was just a Halloween costume, ladies and
gentlemen, but let me tell you, when Slick Willie
and Teddy Kennedy show up, they’re not wearing

fright wigs and grease paint! lt’s the real thing,
ladies and gentlemen! That’s when you should be
scared, that’s when you should really hide your
wallets and bolt the windows, let me tell you! Oh,
it’s all true, folks! Be very afraid!”

The pundit paused, and an air of silence settled
in. He seized his moment. “And folks, that’s why
me and God are asking you to put Bob Goodlatte
and Ollie North up in Washington—to tell it like it
is!”

Tears were streaming down most of the faces in
the crowd now, and their eyes were gleaming with
pride.

They knew this Pat Buchanan, and he was their
good friend.

After the speech, Buchanan circulated among
the common folks, shaking hands and blowing
kisses. I got as close as I could, hoping to get Pat to
sign a “Buchanan. America First!” bumper sticker

A young woman came up with a copy ofone of
his books, and, enraptured, asked him to sign it. As
he obliged her, she said, “Mr. Buchanan, this book
not only made me a conservative, it also influenced
me to convert to Catholicism.”

“Well, that’s wonderful,” said Buchanan, crin-
kling. One ofthe Boys nudged her in the ribs from
behind, and as the space in front ofhim opened up,
I made my move.

“Mr. Buchanan, could you sign these please?”
I said, proffering my bumper stickers.

 €XPlOY'€S ;.SS\A€$ OF racial PO'..Lt'LC$., g€V\A»€\" ORA. C1055

By MICHAEL HEWLETI‘
Phi Staff VVriter

Over two,years ago we watched as Los
Angeles burned with the fires of racial strife
and economic turmoil. ~

The vicious beatings of Rodney King and
Reginald Denny haunted our memories.

Looting, angry faces, smashed windows,
and cries of“Nojustice, no peace!” pummeled
our psyche.

Some condemned it as a riot consisting of
common thugs looting stores and beating inno-
cent victims.

Others regarded it as an uprising and a
desperate protest against racial and economic
injustice.

Two years ago the wounds of L.A. have still
not healed.

Bebe Moore Campbell explores complex
issues of racial politics, gender, and class amid
this background in her new book, Brothers and
Sisters.

The story centers around Esther Jackson, a
regionaloperations manageratAngelCity Bank.

She wants to move into lending because she
believes her M.B.A will be of better use.

She slowly develops a friendship with
Mallory Post, a lender.

Campbell smoothly reveals the built up

W;-i’?7¢5E&POA’5

79 s. mm./24 5;.

463-2742

racial tensions within the relationship.

When Esther finally bursts forth her South
Side anger, the relationship strengthens as they
struggle to understand each other.

When Preston Miller, the CEO of the bank,
hires Humphrey Boone as senior vice presi-
dent, Esther and Mallory’s friendship is tested.

Esther feels pride that a black man has been
promoted to such a high position.

She believes she might have a better shot at
beeominga lender ifsomebody black was in the
upper echelons.

“For the first time since she’d come to

, Angel City, she felt that someone who might be
a friend to her was in control. ‘

”And sitting in the chairas Humphrey walked
to the front ofthe room, she felt proud, the kind
of pride she experienced when the black Olym-
pians brought home the gold, when Jesse Jack-
son ran for President, whenever somebody won
on J copart/_v.”

Unfortunately, not everybody is happy with
the new appointment,

Kirk Madison had been in line for Boone’s
position when he \vas Inade temporary regional
branch manager.

He had even suggested the Minority Loan
Program that Boone now has authority over.
Now all his dreams are shot.

He must face the wife who supported him

after he flunked out of medical school.

His marriage falls apart while bill collectors
nag him endlessly.

His gloom turns into racial hatred when he

 

discovers he lost his job to a black man.

Affirmative action is what his mind screams.

He feels shafted.

“All they had wanted was for him to work
his ass off while they wooed somebody else,
who could get them some newspaper coverage.

After all his hard work, they were going to
hand over the job he deserved to some black
guy.”
llowever, Esther sees Boone as her brother
in this white corporate world and her only
chance to get into lending.

Boone’sattentionstowardMalloryturninto
sexual harassment.

She must choose between racial loyalty or
her friend.

Should she back her friend and lose the
highest level black in the company?

Furthermore, she must face the embezzle-
ment of dormant accounts that cuts across ra-
cial lines.

Campbell crafts a realistic portrayal of ra-
cial tensions in the aftermath ofthe L.A. rebel-
lion.

She paints her characters with a human
dimension.

Whether you like them or not, you under-
stand them.

She gets into the heads and souls of her
characters to unearth their fears and ambitions,
their hates and passions.

Everyone from the damaged ego of Kirk
Madison to Hector. the Hispanic teller who
wants a piece of the American dream, to

Lakeesha, the single mom trying to
make a life for her son.

The reader knows them, under-
standsthem,empathizes withthem.

What is rather amazing is
Campbell’s ability to articulate the
frustrations and anger of all her
characters regardless ofrace, class,
or gender.

She shows Mallory ’s confusion
when Esther seems to take almost
every comment as a racial assault.

She shows Esther’s difficulty .

in decidingwhethertodateTyrone,
a mail clerk, or to wait for a suc-
cessful black man with two de-
grees, a job, a nice house, and a
Benz—someone like Humphrey
Boone.

Using these characters, she
shows how race isn’tjust black and
white.

The answers are not as clearcut
asholding handstogetherand sing-
ing “We shall overcome.”

The book will shake you with
laughterand choke you with anger.

Although the ending is a bit
contrived, the majority ofthe book
is compelling and entertaining.

In the end, Bro!/Iers a/iclSisIcrs
is a book that’s hard to put down
without wanting to pick it back up
again.

Football continues surge in Win over Sewanee . *

By SCo'rr BOOKWALTER
I’/ii Staff Writer

The Sewanee Tigers stormed into
Wilson Field on Saturday hungry for a
victory, but trotted back to Tennessee
after being outgunned by the Washing-
ton and Lee squad 28-l7.

The Generals raised their record to 2-
4 ovcrall with the nonconfcrcncc victory.
W&L also garnered its first win at Wil-
son Field in the final home game ofthe
season.

The W&L offense, after struggling
for the first part of the season, continued
its revival with Seth McKinley leading
the charge. The freshman running back
topped the 100-yard mark for the second
consecutive week with a total of 143
yards. His 38 rushes were the fourth
highest total in school history.

“Seth has really added punch to our
running game,” head coach Gary Fallon
said.

As ifthat wasn’t impressive enough.
McKinley gained a total of 54 yards on
his two kickoff returns. He continues to
head the Old Dominion Athletic Confer»-
cnce in kickoff returns with a 24.3 yard
average.

Unfortunately for Sewance, McKinley
wasn’t the only General creating havoc.
Qu;u'tcr‘back BrooksFischcrshrcddcdtlzc

the season, a 17 for 30 performance for
237 yards and three touchdowns.

“Brooks is progressing and spreading
the ball around.” Fallon commented.

Like McKinley and Fischer. senior
widcout William Propst enjoyed a ter-
rific aftcrnoon by reeling in nine passes
for a total of 136 yards. Fellow senior
Jake Kimballcomplemented him with 53

Propst hit paydirt twice during the
contest, the first being a 32 yard recep-
tion that kicked off the scoring midway
through the first quarter.

The Wilson Field scoreboard was busy
in the second quarter as W&L and

Scwance lit it up fora combined total of i

31 points. There hadn‘t been that much
scoring for the entire game in four ofthe
previous five W&L contests. _

McKinley led off the wild quarter
with a 2 yard plunge to hand the Gcncrals
their largest lead of the season at 14-0.
However, the Tigers quickly answcrcd
back. Scwanee’s Louis Caputo cut the
lead in half with a 58 yard TD reception,
and a Tigcrs field goal closed the gap to
14-10. .

W&L responded with a flurry of its
own. Fischer returned to the air, connect-
ing with Kimball on a 38 yard TD strike.
With less than a minute remaining in the
half, Propst reached the friendly confines
ofthe end zone again with a 13 yard grab,
boosting the Generals’ advantage to 28-
10.

Fallon attributed the Generals’ offen-

sive success to the decrease in turnovers

and the improving protection provided
by the offensive line.

"We’re not turning the ball over like
we did in earlier games,” said the head
coach. '

Whilethe offense racked up437 yards
oftotal offense for the corttcst (3l6 \.uiii'
ing in the first half), the W&L defense
continued to assert itself.

It never let the Tigers back into the
game in the second half, allowing only a
21 yard touchdown reception by
Scwanec’s Caputo.

Junior defensive end Rich Achcc led
W&L with seven tackles. Stuart Hogue
and McGuire Boyd each had six stops,
and defensive tackle Robert Hull added
two sacks.

« Live Drive slows with low participation

bers as a ride back from Zollman’s, but

...)

 

By DAN ODENWALD
Phi Staff Writer

You cannot count on Live Drive to
shuttle you home from a late night
party at Zollman’s any longer.

As of earlier this week, Live Drive
was temporarily shut down due to lack
of volunteer support. Live Drive Di-
rector Brent Avery ’95, said that he
explored all avenues to generate stu-
dent support for the student-run ser-
vice, but could ﬁnd none.

Avery has been involved with Live
Drive since he was a freshman and has
noticed that volunteer support has de-
clined with each year.

Avery has expressed his disappoint-
ment with the poor showing.

The breaking point was this past
Halloween weekend. Avery had ini-
tially enlisted several people to drive,
but last minute cancellations resulted
in Live Drive being unable to operate.
This was not a rare occurrence for Live
Drive. Apparently, the paucity of stu-
dent volunteers has plagued Live Drive
for many months.

Avery said that it was upsetting that
students used Live Drive in great num-

did not return the favor and offer to
drive on a weekend they planned to
remain sober.

Avery was also disappointed with
the lack of fraternity support. While
sign-up lists were circulated to each of
the fraternities, not one submitted a list
of volunteers. Sororities, on the other
hand, were overwhelmingly support-
ive. Each offered Live Drive a list of
more than fifteen volunteers.

Dean of Students David Howison
and Avery decided that Live Drive
would no longer continue its service in
a joint meeting last week.

They agreed that the program would
be submitted to the Student Health
Committee of which Howison is head.

Student Health will study the future
of Live Drive and then recommend a
workable solution. The Committee will
also examine the role Live Drive has
played cr. campus and determine why
student volunteer support is lacking.

Howison said, “The Committee will
review Live Drive in the larger context
of the alcohol issue on this campus and
determine the role which it will play in
the future.”

Avery believed one of the main

infrequency with which it ran.

It was primarily offered on bi gparty
weekends such as Homecoming, Hal-
loween, Christmas, and Fancy Dress.

Since students rarely knew when
Live Drive was planning to operate,
few students ever called for service
on weekends other than major
party weekends.

Student reaction has been varied.
Some students are discouraged with
the shutting down of Live Drive.

“It’s unfortunate that we don’t have
enough volunteers, but that’s hypo-
critical of me to say because l’ve never
volunteered,” said senior Rob Eison.

Freshman Lorraine Taurassi said,
“It’s bad because you can’t always
depend on people who say their going
to stay sober and drive and then drink.”

Other students believe Live Drive
was not important and too few students
made use of it.

“No one really used it anyway. Fra-
ternities usually have sober drivers, so
it doesn’t really matter,” said sopho-
more Bill Rust.

The vans used for Live Drive will
be placed under the management of
Howison’s office. Students will still

activities which may require their use.

Ultimately, Avery hopes to see Live
Drive resurrected, but understands that

to happen.

Goodlatte voices support for
term limits and other controls

By PETER WEISSMAN
Phi Staff Writer

.Term limits would free the U.S. Congress
from the restrictive control of career politi-
cians, Representative Robert Goodlatte told a
crowded audience at his alma mater, Washing-
ton and Lee University Law School, last Thurs-
day night.

“If you disperse that power and you limit the
amount of time... I think you’re going to see a
much more responsive, streamlined, slimmed-
down Congress that truly is attending to its
legislative duties,” the Republican said in a
calmly-delivered, 45-minute speech to about
65 people.

Goodlatte, whose 6th Dis-
trict includes Lexington,
Roanoke, and Lynchburg, is
running unopposed for
his second term in
Tuesday’s election.

Goodlatte supports a con-
stitutional amendment limit-
ing the terms of Senators and
Representatives to 12 con-
secutive years that, he said,
would revive the Congress’
constitutional role.

“The nature of the Con-
gress, in terms of it being a
citizen legislature rather than
a career, has changed dra-
matically during the course
of the country,” he said. As Goodlatte envi-
sions term limits, members could return to
Congress with no seniority after a break in their
service. He said three problems with Congress
could be ﬁxed by limiting terms.

The ﬁrst problem, Goodlatte said, is the
seniority system. Traditionally, the the most
senior member of the majority party on a com-
mittee becomes the chairman.

“Right now, you have a Congress that is
dominated in the House of Representatives and
similarly in the Senate by eight or 10 mem-
bers,” Goodlatte said, referring to the chairmen
of the most inﬂuential committees. He said that
with term limits chairmen would be selected by
merit rather than seniority.

Second, Goodlatte said, members do not
participate in congressional deliberations. He
called the current system “an incentive to warm
a seat for decades” as a member waits to accu-
mulate seniority power. He said members

 

Goodlatte

would deliberate more if they had a limited
amount of time in the Congress.

Third, Goodlatte said, challengers can ’t over-
come the incumbent advantages like favorable
federal election laws, free mail, and large con-.
gressional staffs.

Goodlatte also discussed three arguments
against term limits. He said the strongest point,
that term limits restrict the right of voters to
choose, is “offset by the problems created by
career politicians.” Second, Goodlatte said,
term limits will not increase the power of other
Washington players like lobbyists, staff mem-
bers, and executive branch bureaucrats. Third,
Goodlatte said, he found that members in their
last term “work diligently to pass legislation”
rather than abuse or neglect
their power, as some term limit
opponents argue. He said that
the possibility of term limits
helping Republicans is not a
factor in his support.
Goodlatte also cited court
cases that support and oppose
term limits from a
judicial perspective.

Some political scientists
oppose term limits for‘ other
reasons. Albert Hunt writes
in Governing that members
would form cozy relationships
with special interests who
could employ them after their
shortened public service.
Hodding Carter III writes in
Perspective on American Government that in-
creasing the numberof inexperienced members
would make an already “gridlocked” Congress
even more inefﬁcient. Nelson Polsby argues
that term limits would force out good members
in Point-Counterpoint: Readings in
American Government.

So far, citizens in 17 states have limited the
terms of their members of the U.S. Congress.
Virginia does not allow proposals to originate
from citizen initiatives. On Tuesday, eight
additional states will vote on term limits.
Goodlatte said he supports these state initia-
tives because they increase pressure for term
limits nationally. Overall, Goodlatte says he
wants uniform limits through a constitutional
amendment. The constitutionality of these
state-initiatives will be debated before the
Supreme Court in an Arkansas case on
November 29.

If the court overrules the states’ efforts, term

limits could only be adopted by amending the
Constitution. That process requires the votes of
two-thirds of each house of Congress to pro-
pose an amendment and three-fourths of the

...,.S1a1e.Iegislaturcs to ratify it.

Goodlatte estimated that 180 more repre-
sentatives are needed to make two-thirds in the
House. Goodlatte did not estimate how many
more supporters are needed in the Senate.

Goodlatte said he supports other reforms
and has made changes in his own ofﬁce. He
said he cut his staff by 25 percent and spent less
than half of the amount of free postage he is
allowed. Goodlatte helped pass a rule that lim-
its anyone in the Republican caucus to six years
as a top committee chair.

Goodlatte ’77L and Maryellen Flaherty
Goodlatte, ’78L were married in Lee Chapel,
and he said they were the first married couple at
the law school.

He said that Davidson Park looks much
better than it did when he lived there in married
student housing for $70 a month. After gradu-
ating from W&L Law, Goodlatte worked for
Congressman Caldwell Butler handling con-
stituent problems. Goodlatte later chaired the
6th District Republican Party.

Goodlatte’s district was Republican from
1952-1982. Democrat Jim Olin represented the
district from 1982-1992. In 1992, Goodlatte
beat Democrat Steve Musselwhite with 60 per-
cent of the vote.

Goodlatte said he supports Senate candidate
Oliver North. Goodlatte said that challenger
Marshall Coleman invited him to a North rally
six years ago.

The speech was sponsored by the Contact
Committee, the American Civil Liberties Union
chapter, the Federalist Society, and the
Rutherford Institute. Clyde “Trey” Copeland
’96L, a law school representative of Contact
who interned in Goodlatte’s ofﬁce, said the
speech was educational.

“I think his speech was not just a political,
one-sided ranting, but it was very balanced,”
he said.

Goodlatte said he has limited his own terms.

“The longer somebody stays in Washing-
ton, the more they become part of that inside the
Beltway scene, the more they become detached
and removed from their constituents, the less
likely they are to be responsive to new ideas,”
Goodlatte said.

“And term limits has the effect of constantly

bringing into the Congress people who have A

other life experiences.”

Women’s Rush gets 148 sign-ups

By ETHAN KRUPP
Phi News Editor

There are 186 women in the
freshman class and 148 have regis-
tered for Sorority Rush. Last year,
150 women registered.

‘ Sorority Rush began on Sun-

day, October 30, with sign-up in
the Evans Dining Hall. Women
can turn registration forms until
Monday, November 27.

1 Katie Stephens, the Vice-Presi-

dent of Panhellenic Council, said
“we are expecting more women to
sign up, including some upperclass-
man.”

Since the sign-up, limited con-

tact has been in place.

“Limited contact means the up-
perclassman can’t initiate contact
with the freshman.”

Accidental contact between
freshmen and upperclassmen is not
in violation of the limited contact
rules. Saying hello on the Hill or
discussing a shared class will also
not be considered contact. Stephens
said the penalty for violating the
limited contact rules varies, de-
pending on the circumstances.

Stephens said there are no ma-
jor changes in Rush this year, other
than the grade release. Some
women will then be cut from those
sororities requiring a GPA. above
the 2.0 G.P.A. required to Rush,

but Stephens stressed that they
would not be totally released from
Rush.

“Some sororities require a
higher one to pledge,” said
Stephens and because of this, “there
will be a grade release after the
first night of Rush.”

Kit Dodds, head Rho Chi, said
one of the goals of this year’s Rush
is to involve the Rho Chis more.

“We are trying to give the coun-
selors more training and get them
more involved [in the Rush pro-
cess],” said Dodds.

Dodds, who has been a Rho Chi
for the past two years, said every
Rush is different and presents dif-
ficult situations. Her experience in

being a Rho Chi has allowed her to
help the other Rho Chis prepare for
these situations this year. She de-
clined to elaborate on speciﬁc situ-
ations. ‘

Dodds said she became a Rho
Chi because the program is very
important and can have a huge
impact on Rush.

“The Rho Chi is there to be
objective, and be there for the fresh-
men to talk to if they ’re confused.”

Dodds emphasized that the
freshmen should not worry about
[Rush] because, everything will
work out.

“The freshmen should get to
know each other and just be fresh-
men,” said Stephens.

He will return in spring to the house he purchased

By ALEX CHRISTENSEN
Phi Staff Writer

Inﬂuential contemporary painter Cy Twombly, born in Lexington when his father was
Washington and Lee’s athletic director, has purchased a Lexington house, where he is looking to

build a permanent studio.

Often referred to as the heir of such greats as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning,
Twombly’s style is classified as abstract expressionism.

Twombly spent much of September and October here at his new home, alternating between
Lexington and New York City, where his retrospective show is being held at the Museum of
Modern Art. Twombly also has three residences in Italy.

The artist has worked in Lexington before, renting warehouse space here last spring in order

to finish a painting.

“He has been really good about supporting local artists and attending their shows when he has
been here,” said Dr. Pamela Simpson of the Art Department. Twombly has attended openings and
even helped to hang paintings for local artists’ shows.

“It really means a lot to local artists to have the support of such an important ﬁgure,”

said Simpson.

Twombly left for Europe at the end of October and is expected to return to Lexington in

the spring.

Drinking until busted

The Controlled Drinking Experiment shows B.A.C

By KATHRYN MAYURNIK
Phi Staff Writer

On Wednesday, October 26, the General
Headquarters restaurant housed the biggest
drinking contest since Tear Night.

It had all of the basic elements of a Washing-
ton and Lee fraternity party-music, funnels,
and a lot of Natural Light. However, the fact
that Mike Young, Director of Security, was
present with a breathalizer, and there was no
stampede for the door, indicates that this was no
ordinary party. Rather, it was the Controlled
Drinking Experiment, sponsored and run by the
Peer Counselors.

Anyone twenty-one or older could partici-
pate in the experiment, which entailed drinking
one beer every fifteen minutes, after which a
breathalizer test was given. One of the pur-
poses of the evening was to show students at
which point they have reached the Blood Alco-
hol Content of .02, which is a full DUI for
persons under twenty-one, and the BAC of .08,
which is legally-drunk for everyone else. To
avoid an out-of-control situation, a person’s
alcohol was cut off once they reached .06.

Dr. James Worth, a psychologist at W&L,
explained the merits of the experiment. “This

is a good oportunity for students to learn how a
particular BAC feels,” Worth said. “They
might think they feel fine and have not had
much to drink, but their BAC could be higher
than they think.”

Worth was more worried about reducing
alcohol use than eliminating it altogether.

“I realize that drinking is an embedded as-
pect of college life, and I don’t condemn it.
What frightens me is that that so much exces-
sive and high risk drinking goes on. According
to a 1993 poll, 69% of W&L students have
experienced a blackout. People need to drink
more responsibly and at lower risk.”

The experiment also showed how several
factors attribute to a BAC, the main ones being
weight, gender, and the amount of food in the
stomach. The person with the highest BAC was
a female who hadn’t had dinner, and the person
who held out the longest was a male whose
weight played a factor.

By attaching a condom to the end of a funnel
and pouring a few beers down it, Young dem-
onstrated the dangers of funneling. “If I see any
of these, I will take them away. These will kill,”
Young said. “When I threatened to take one
away from a young man, he threatened to sue
me for violating his civil rights. I told him that
I’d call his mother.”

Saudis turn down bank proposal

Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations refused to support a proposal by
the Clinton Administration for a multibillion-dollar development bank for
the Middle East. The countries argued at an economic conference in
Morocco that their own economic problems made it difﬁcult to devote the
necessary funds to the bank. The US has made several requests for
ﬁnancial commitments from Saudi Arabia, which has been running budget
deﬁcits of $10 billion a year. US ofﬁcials remain confident that there will
eventually be a bank, in spite of objections from the Arabs.

Scandal shake up Russian military

Recent corruption scandals have disrupted Russia’s military establish-
ment. President Boris Yeltsin dismissed on Tuesday a deputy defense
minister, who, along with other Russian ofﬁcers, had been accused of the
illegal sale of millions of dollars of Government property which was to be
brought back to Russia. Other instances, including the death of a Russian
journalist investigating corruption among army officers and the purchase
of Mercedes sedans from illegal funds, have other Russian ofﬁcers
campaigning to keep their jobs.

Burning ﬂoods kill 200 in Egypt

At least 200 Egyptians were killed Wednesday when an explosions sent
ﬂoods of blazing fuel through the streets of a small village. Storms and
ﬂash ﬂoods caused a bridge to collapse over a military fuel complex 200
miles south of Cairo. The collapse toppled fuel tanks, setting off an
explosion encompassing 15,000 tons of motor and aircraft fuel. Floodwa-
ters spread the burning fuel through streets, causing thousands of survivors

to seek refuge in the nearby capital of Asyut.

White House shooting suspect charged

   

 

Federal officials charged a Colorado man Sunday with felony counts for
shooting up the White House with riﬂe fire. After much debate, they
decided not to charge Francisco Duran with attempted assassination of the
President. Duran was arraigned on Monday with charges of willfully
damaging government property and violation of laws that prohibit a
convicted felon of possessing a weapon. Duran was convicted in 1991 of
aggravated assault with a vehicle and drunk and disorderly conduct.
Authorities say Duran has given them few clues to the case and is refusing
to talk with them.

Report condemns CIA’s ineptitude in spy
case

A 116-page report by the Senate Select Committee said that the CIA’s
hunt for convicted spy Aldrich Ames was thrown off the track by Soviet
deception and the ineptitude of the CIA. Ames sold secrets to the Soviet
Union from 1985 until his arrest this February. Soviet spies gave false
information to the CIA, who believed most of it. For seven years the CIA
did not seek aid or share information with the FBl’s spy detectors, but
instead chose to study its old files instead of seeking new information about
why its best Soviet agents were being murdered.

Hill convicted in abortion shooting

A Florida jury took just 20 minutes to convict former minister Paul Hill
of murder in the slayings of an abortion doctor and his bodyguard. Hill
could receive a sentence of life in prison or death in the electric chair. Hill
acted as his own lawyer and offered no defense during his three day trial.
In October, Hill became the ﬁrst person convicted of violating the new
federal law against harassing or using violence against those entering
abortion clinics.

North and Robb trade insults as election day
draws near

Both Charles Robb and Oliver North traded insults Wednesday, the
beginning of the last week before the Senate election. At a campaign stop
in Woodridge, Robb criticized North’s no new taxes pledge as being
irresponsible and likely to cause mistrust of the government. That same
day, North accused Robb of doing nothing for Virginians except raising
their taxes. North attended a College Republicans meeting at UVA, which
was also attended by a large crowd of anti-North demonstrators.

Mary Washington faculty votes to give ben-
efits to unmarried partners

Faculty members at Mary Washington College voiced their support
Wednesday night for extending health benefits to the live-in partners of
homosexual and heterosexual employees of the college. The faculty is now
asking the Faculty Senate of Virginia to support their efforts to extend these
beneﬁts. Doing so would require revision of a statewide policy. Currently
206 American institutions of higher learning offer these health beneﬁts to
unmarried partners of faculty.

The C ampus 
Freshman dorm rooms robbed

Several rooms in Graham—Lees dormitory were burglarized over the
weekend. Between $200 and $300 was stolen from Jon Bayer's room and
$30 was stolen from Kelley Dyer's room. Neither freshman had locked
their rooms. Nothing else was stolen. W&L Director of Security Mike
Young said there are no leads or suspects in the case.

North wins W&L ock eeti

By MICHAEL Hewusrr
Phi Staff Writer

Oliver North won the Virginia Sen-
ate race —- at least according to Wash-
ington and Lee students. »

The Mock Election was held on
Friday, October 28 from 10 a.m. to 3
p.m. and 224 students voted in the
election. North won by 58.9 percent,
Robb received 28.6 percent, and
Coleman received 12.5 percent.

College Republican president Dou-
glas Theissen said he asked the College
Democrat president, Nova Clarke, to
participate in the Mock Election.

He said he made sure that a College
Democrat was always present at the
election booth. He and Clarke verified

said, “and we’re very excited to
have Oliver North win big in this
changing environment.”

He said North’s victory proves that
even in a diverse W&L, conservatives
still win. Thirteen other Mock Election
have gone to North and UVA’s mock
election went to a conservative for the
first time.

“Students all over the state are turn-
ing toward North and W&L is another
example of that,” he said.

Clarke was also happy with
the results.

‘‘I’m quite happy because it shows
that there are some thinking people on
this campus,” she said.

“We’re very pleased with the turn-
out, considering that the faculty could
not vote and Stewart North (North’s
son) could stand (at the voting booth)

   

and counted the ballots. ‘ P
The election results pleased him.
“The College Republicans are happy

with the results becuase the mood of

the campus has been more liberal,” he

for several hours.”

She said the election does not accu-
rately predict how the Virginians will
vote, citing that only a tenth of the
students voted in the election.

Bolden speaks to future lawyers

He warns of changing rules and rewards of law

BY MlCHAEL HEWLETT
Pm STAFF Wrzmzr

Frank Bolden said law students are in for a trick or
treat situation in his speech at Lee Chapel on Octo-
ber 31 at 7 p.m.

“Those of you pursuing law as a route to power are
in for a rude awakening,” he said.

Bolden is Vice President for the Corporate Staff at
Johnson & Johnson, lnc. Prior to this promotion,
Bolden was responsible for all employment relations
matters, including ERISA, labor relations, equal
opportunity and affirmative action for the entire
corporation. Bolden has also served as the
corporations secretary and as a member of its
legal department.

Bolden gave a speech on “How to Make Your
Dream Reality,” which was sponsored by the Black
Law Student Association, Minority Student Asso-
ciation, Women Law Student Association, Contact
and the Federalist Society.

He said the rules and rewards of the game are
changing and businesses are enhancingtheir abilities
in global economy. Businesses are eliminating un-
necessary costs such as legal fees. He cited a friend
who said a company unable to raise prices reviewed
its standing with three law firms and sought to
negotiate the fees. One ﬁrm refused to negotiate, the
second agreed to reduce and the third ﬁrm asked him
what the fee should be.

He said in a nation with one lawyer for every 35
citizens, Americans must ask are there too many
lawyers. He said this has led to increased competition
for young lawyers.

Bolden reassured law students that opportunities

are still available, but it will take more than intelli-
gence, hard work, and a love for law to become
successful. He has talked to his lawyer friends and
came up with ten essentials for law students: integ-
rity, a continued search for knowledge, efficiency,
responsiveness, knowledge of the business, the abil-
ity to build relationships, reliability and quality,
excellent communications and presentation skills,
courage and leadership.

He said young lawyers need to possess some
sense of ethics.

“The profession has taken too many knocks to not
have that standard,” he said.

Bolden said lawyers must keep abreast of changes
in the law and predict in what direction the law will
move. The lawyer also must continually educate
himself about new technology. No longer are corpo-
rate deals conducted in smoke filled rooms but rather
over faxes.

“There’s no place for a new attorney who cannot
capitalize on new technology,” he said.

He said clients must feel comfortable with the
ir lawyer.

“You may write the greatest brief in the world but
if you cannot answer the phone, you may lose their
business,” Bolden said.

Lawyers must also have the courage, orthe ability
and will to say no when the time is required. He said
there are times when there is no way for a lawyer to
do what the client wants.

He said law has become more of a business than
a profession. Promotions are based on merit, loyalty
and value. Lawyers must prove that they will make a
contribution to the law ﬁrm. He said employers look
at an applicant’s grades, resume and interview skills.

He said racism and sexism still exists in the
law profession.

“It is true that to be successful in law,” he said,
“you will have to deal with more than your white
male successors.”

Bolden said most whites are not racists and would
like to eliminate this scourge. Minority and women
lawyers should develop five additional steps for
success: competence, courage, communication, can-
dor and compatibility.

“Americans are good at saying one thing and
meaning another,” he said.

Lawyers should communicate honestly about
problems they see in the workplace. They should also
avoid assumptions and should get the facts.

He said lawyers will succeed much faster if they
learn the culture of the company and if people feel
comfortable with them. He related the story of man
who felt he had not been promoted because he was
black. He suggested that his friend cut his beard off.
When he did, he got the promotion. Asked whether
this placed a heavier burden on blacks, he said it is an
individual choice.

“You will have to draw the line as to where you
think the limits are,” he said.

ln response to a question about the glass ceiling,
he said it does exist.

“You feel it there when you look around and don’t
see any black faces,” he said. “Proving that it’s there
is another matter.”

Bolden received his BA from the University of
Vermont and his MBA from the Columbia Univer-
sity Graduate School. He received his JD from the
Columbia School of Law.

Bolden is chairman ofthe Board at Union County
College and is a member of the Board ofTrustees at
the University of Vermont. A Vietnam war veteran,
he has received numerous meritorious awards for
community service.

IFC gives money to campus, community groups

BY CINDY YOUNG
PHI STAFF WRITER

The lnterfraternity Coucil has re-
cently approved an impressive amount
of donations to beneﬁt various cam-
pus and community affairs.

Habitat for Humanity, a new group
to the Washington and Lee campus,
received a $2,500 donation from the
IFC. This money will help fund the
group’s plans to build a house this
year for a needy family in the Lexing-
ton community, on behalf of the se-
nior class.

The IFC presented the W&L Ath-
letic Department with $425, an
amount that financed the purchase of
a piano. On this piano freshman
Jonathan Riehlwillperforrn the W&L
Swing at a variety of athletic events.

Two $500 donations were also set
aside to fund upcoming campus
programs. A further donation of $400
was contributed to a literary reading
held in the library this past Wednes-
day, entitled “Writer’s Harvest: The
National Reading.” The program is
the country’s largest literary benefit
to combat hunger.

IFC President Kevin Batteh,
contributing not only money but his

reading skills as well, was among the
featured readers.

Why so much money to donate to
charitable causes?

IFC Treasurer Bryan King cites
the much larger Rush participation
this year than in the past.

“Rush ﬁnes certainly helped” as
well, King adds.

Amongother events coming up on
the IFC agenda is a Police Relations
meeting next Thursday afternoon at
4:00 p.m. with the Lexington
Police Department.

This event occurs several times
throughout the year, in order to open
up communications between the

policeand representativesofthecam—
pus fraternities.

Another issue the IFC is currently
considering is the possibility of de-
ferring Rush until Winter Term in
the future. A later Rush is brought up
each year, according to Batteh.

The IFC will organize a commit-
tee of sophomore and junior frater-
nity members to fully consider the
advantages and disadvantages of
postponing Rush.

A final event coming up on the
IFC calendar is a meeting of pledge
class presidents this Thursday,
November 10, to discuss any
pledge concerns.

A fraternity with a twist. This is how Paul
Saboe, Service Vice-President, describes Al-
pha Phi Omega.

APO is a national service fraternity that has
maintained the Alpha Beta Tau chapter on
Washington and Lee’s campus for the past
decade. For most of that time, APO was a little
known organization with few participants who
concentrated on weekend, on-campus service
projects. However, this year the brothers (the
traditional term for both the male and female
members) of APO have made, according to
Saboe, great strides in “capturing legitimacy.”

Over Fall Term, APO has become very

sions during home football games this
fall has also been a good fund-raiser
for the group. This year, money raised
is being used to defray the cost.of
traveling to the National APO Con-
ference in Dallas, Texas for four mem-
bers. In September, APO sponsored
another fund—raiser, an ice cream eat-
a-thon, through which about $200 was
raised. However, only half of this
money will be used for convention
travel costs. The other half will soon
be donated to Habitat For Humanity.

The first community project which
APO participated in was l_.exington’s
Safe and Sound Project. Through
this, members were able to landscape
and refurbish portions of the Woods

Throughout October, APO has

projects, the first being a tutoring

Through this project, twenty stu-
dents dedicate a couple hours per

Stargate — in":

Remember theScoobyDoo episodes
where Scooby and Shaggy were joined
by the Harlem Globetrotters, or Batman
and Robin, or even Ma Barker and her
gang?

Maybe you’ve seen old comedies
likeAbbot and Costello Meet Franken-
stein.

Occasionally, mixing different char-
acters and genres makes a ﬁlm fun and
interesting, building on the strength of
each individual theme.

That is clearly what the makers of
Stargate were after— imagine King Tut
meets Buck Rogers meets Conan the
Barbarian. Unfortunately, the whole
doesn’t equal the sum of its parts.

Essentially, the plot revolves around
a ‘stargate’ to another planet, found

Davidson) discovers that Colonel
O’Neill has been given orders to de-
stroy the stargate, to prevent anything
dangerous going back to Earth.
Naturally he gets mad, and in his
anger decides instead to send the bomb
back to Earth. \

But when his once-Egyptian slaves
discover that Ra is just an alien and not
a god, they too want to throw off his
rule.

Toss in a romance between Dr. Jack-
son and a young native girl, and soon
there is a heady running together of
plots, all of which require the defeat of
Ra.

At ﬁrst glance it really seems like
this movie has potential, managing to
mix the historic details of Indiana] ones
with the cool weapons of Star Wars.

But it quickly becomes apparent
that this clever mixture is just about the
only thing this movie has going for it.

The biggest problem is the screen-
play, which hurries along way too
quickly.

There isn’t nearly enough develop-
ment of the plot - it almost seems like
a Star Trek episode expanded to two
hours.

One reason Star Trek can get away

with that is because of the excellent
interplay between characters.

But, Stargate is a one-shot movie,
not a televised serial.

The result is that there is also no
character development, and what could
be excellent roles go unﬁnished.

The acting is not at all bad, but it is
difﬁcult to bring to life characters who
do so much in so little time.

Spader and Russell, though both
decent enough actors, seem like the
cut-outs they are forced to be.

I was pleasantly surprised with the
alien, Ra.

I am not a Jaye Davidson fan (re-
member him from The Crying Game?).

However, he managed to bring a lot
of foreboding and malice to the charac-
ter, despite his soft, feminine features
and very slight build.

For all that the ﬁlm lacks, it defi-
nitely has that old Hollywood magic.
The sets and special effects are ﬁrst
rate.

The costumes are also especially
beautiful, which makes all of director
Roland Emmerich’s shots seems par-
ticularly interesting.

Essentially, Stargate is the kind of
movie that never lives up to its prom-

raises the total membership of the chapter to 36.
Unlike most of the other Greek organizations
on campus, APO issues no bids, is open to all
undergraduate and law students, and is not
accountable to the lnterfratemity Council or

Frum glimpses into the trium ins and tragedies of conservatism

By MICHAEL HEWLETI‘
Phi Staff Writer

Newt Gingrich is on the cover of Time magazine. Oliver
North is on the cover of Newsweek. Political scientists are
predicting that Republicans could take over the Congress.
The words "Republican" and "conservative" ﬁll the air
these days. Rush Limbaugh thinks Clinton doesn’t have a
chance for reelection, leaving room for such conservative
luminaries as Dick Cheney, Jack Kemp, Bob Dole, Phil
Gramm and Dan Quayle (dream on Danny boy). The Re-
publicans are having a grand time criticizing the extremes of
leftist politics.

Yet, David Frum, author of Dead Right, suggests the
Republican Party and conservatives in general have some
internal problems to work out.

Frum argues that conservatives have moved away from
their traditional anti-govemment stance. He said conserva-
tives fall into three basic categories: optimist, moralist, and
nationalist. Kemp, Bennett, and Buchanan fall into these
camps respectively.

Optimist conservatives believe that government can pro-
vide incentives to change the immoral behavior of the
underclass.

Optimists such as Kemp propose government sponsored
‘ideas such as enterprise zones and tenant control. If poor
people felt they had a stake in their community, they would
improve their lives, their environment. Kemp acknowl-
edges the failures of Johnson’s War on Poverty but believes
government linked with traditional values can make a dif-

ference. Frum argues t at Kemp forgets that the majority of
people who live in public housing subsist on welfare. Frum
argues that enterprise zones have proven not to work.
School vouchers are another optimist conservative idea that
according to Frum does not work. School vouchers operate
on the notion that if public schools were privatized and
allowed to compete in the free market, education would
improve.

Vouchers would give parents choice in what type of
education they would receive. Although championed by
conservatives, Frum argues that vouchers would not work.
Vouchers uses the free market to answer the question of
what schools will teach. The problem is that vouchers
conflict with the establishment clause of the Constitution
which creates the barrier between state and religion. Frum
further contends there is no evidence that students do better
at private schools than public. Vouchers simply sidestep the
conflicts over values.

Values are a major concern of moralist conservatives.
Bennett and others believe that America has moved away
from its traditional, or what Frum calls bourgeois, values.
He thinks that the major problems of crime and poverty
derive from moral decay. The solution is that the federal
government should use its power to renew traditional val-
ues. If people learn values such as virtue, honesty and
character, social problems will become less vexing. “lf the
society is wholesome, then the instructions broadcast to the
people at the bottom will be wholesome too.”

Probably the most extreme conservatives are nationalists
such as Buchanan. Nationalists contend that immigration
has not only burdened state and local governments with

rising costs in welfare and education but that it has the
frightening possibility of destroying the Anglo-American
character of the nation. In other words American is becom-
ing less European, less white. Nationalists also contend that
America must again become number one. They resort to the
isolationism once rampant in the years after World War II.
In one particularly weak argument, Frum compares this
nationalistic conservatism with multiculturalism. “Nation-
alist conservatism simply imports left-wing identity politics
into a new context.” I found this more than any other
argument particularly hard to swallow.

He makes other less credible arguments. He contends
that Reagan failed to slash federal spending. According to
him, federal spending actually went up, which is true.
However, it should be noted that Reagan spent money on
military while he slashed spending for various social pro-
grams. Frum also believes that the Religious Right does not
exist. If the Religious Right does not exist, somebody please
inform Pat Robertson of this wonderful news.

Frum writes with fervor and urgency as he documents
clearly what the Republican Party must do before the 1996
presidential elections.

Although I disagreed strongly with much of his ideas, I
appreciated his critique of conservatives. Frum gives a
concise picture of what conservatives believe and why they
think a certain way. Always provocative and controversial,
Frum tears away the mask and allows readers to get an inside
glimpse into some of the triumphs and tragedies of conser-
vatism, all the way from its inception to its present and to its
future. Although Frum is dead wrong on many issues, Frum
nonetheless makes Dead Right an interesting read.

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

A viable option to revive
Live Drive

Live Drive has been forced to come to a halt
in the past few weeks due to a lack of student
volunteers. This is both a detriment to the university
community and a danger to the students and the
people on the streets of Lexington. We need an
active Live Drive, a valid option to drunk driving
that works, and everyone in the community should
be involved in affecting this solution. This is
especially true for those of us under 21 who cannot
afford to drive after any drinking. The best option
would be one in which students would ﬂock to
volunteer for this community service, but obviously
that is not happening. We propose the following
alternative: one which would be fair to all involved.
A resource which is clearly going to waste is
students who receive “hours” for violations of
university housing policies. It seems to us that these
students would be better put to use as sober drivers
for their inebriated peers. We feel it is more
important to keep drunk drivers off of the roads than
to have perfectly polished silverware and dust—free
books. This policy could also apply to those who
receive community service hours from the Student '
Conduct Committee or Student-Factulty Hearing
Board; there is no better service to the community

than to keep its members alive.

Term limits violate Voters’ freedom

NOVA

’96

 

Tuesday is the big day, according to
some political pundits, when the anti-
incumbent fervor sweeping the coun-
try will sweep career politicians out of

«_ office. Of course many of those sup-

posed to be swept out of ofﬁce are
Democrats. Do I detect a hint of bias
among those pundits? This brings me
to the point of this column: term limts.
I am against them for two reasons.

First, we already have term limits
guaranteed by the Constitution in this
country. These term limits are called
elections, by which the people can kick
their elected representatives out of of-
ﬁce if they so choose.

Second, I believe that by forcing a
representative out of office at a certain
period we are taking away power from
the people. Also, more importantly, we
are allowing the voters to get off scot
free from having to make tough choices
and actually learn something about the
way politics works.

As to the ﬁrst proposition that there
are already term limits, the Supreme
Court has decided to hear the
Wahsington State case, brought by
Speaker of the House Tom Foley,
against term limits that were adopted
by Washington state.

As an aside for anyone who thinks
politicians are only in politics for their

own advancement and proﬁt, people
should ealize that Tom Foley could
have backed out from bringing this
case. A freshman representative from
Washington offered to bring the case
on behalf of Foley. This was to protect
Foley’s chances of re-election since
bringing a suit against term limits is not
likely to endear him to the voters in an

proposition. I believe that term limits
are essentially a loss of freedom for
voters. Unfortunately, it appears that
voters arewillingtosacriﬁcetheirfree-
dom in order to be excused from the
pressure of actually having to know
anything about government or the
stands their representatives take on any
issues (or even who their representa-
tives are). ,

Here are some examples of just how
uninformed the American voter is: In a
recent Times Mirror survey most

Americans didn’t know who Newt
Gingrich, Dick Gephardt, or Bob
Michel were. Four out of ten Ameri-
cans didn’t know that the Democrats
and not the Republicans control the
Congress (although that may be a fac-
tor of wishful thinking). Then there is
the indecisiveness as to what their rep-
resentative should be doing. Sixty-three

Now for e v e r ,
the second seventy-

three percent said that their representa-
tives should be trying to bring federal
projects to their district, and 58% said
that their representative should try to
direct more government spending
toward their district. I guess it’s only
bad pork if it’s not in your district.
Actually, one of the most distress-
ing ﬁgures to me was that a third to a
half of those surveyed could not name
a piece of legislation passed by Con-
gress. There really is no excuse for
that, considering these people are prob-

ably being affected by a piece of legis-
lation as you read this. The problem is
that people don’t really want to know
about any of these pieces of legislation.
They just want to go on with their lives
and then complain when their repre-
sentatives votes for something that ends
up affecting them negatively.

People are also voting on character
without really knowing anything about
the issue. A Washington Post survey
revealed that 66% of Virginia voters
were unaware of the position of the
Senate candidates on the issues. I don’t

want to hear any crying when people

start realizing their interests aren’t be-
ing promoted.

This is the reason l’m against tenn
limits. I think voters need to learn about
the issues and actually get involved in
politics. Term limits offer them a way
to escape learning if they know their
represenatives will be out of office in 6
or 8 years. They’ve waited this long-—
What’s a few more years.

Actually, I wonder how many Re-
publicans (their party seems to be more
in favor of term limits) are secretly
cheering on Tom Foley. Newt Gingrich,
who has been in office over ten years,
would never get the chance to fulﬁll
his dreams of being Speaker of the
House if term limits are declared legal:
l’m sure somewhere in the back of
his mind he’s hoping Foley will win
the case.

I hope all of you have either ﬁlled
out absentee ballots or are voting on
Tuesday.

This may be your last chance at
freedom before the chains of tenn lim-
its restrain your right to choose who
should represent you.

North not your average political scum

THE FAR MIDDLE
ALEX CHRISTENSEN

I predicted Ollie North would be president when
I was watching the Iran-Contra hearings in the
summer of ’86. I was ten years old at the time. Maybe
I was a precocious political junkie, but maybe, just
maybe, I am clairvoyant, and see through the dark
veil that hides the future from the prying eyes of
most people.

There was something Reaganesque (not to be
confused with Reaganian) about the way he could
mist up on cue when recounting the operation he ran
which supplied arms to the Ayatollah Khomeini and
funneled the money, against express congressional
sanction, to those freedom-loving Nicaraguan
Contras, simultaneously creating a market for fur-
ther Mideast hostage-taking and spitting on the Con-
stitution. It not only showed that he would do any-
thing to further his own interests, but that he could do
it with flair and drama.

Hey howdy, if that’s not political acumen, I don’t
know what is.

So now good ol’ Ollie, man of the people, friend
to you and me, the man with one plaid shirt, is well
on his way to that goal (sounds of sensible Ameri-
cans laughing wildly and then slitting their throats).

I can hear the North Republicans now, speaking
reassuringly, “Alex, Alex, relax, friend. You’re a
centrist, you’re a moderate, you shouldn’t be fright-
ened by any politician. You claim to listen calmly to
each individual before condemning them.” And to a
certain extent, they are right. However, I reserve the
right to be irrational about Ollie North’s beliefs since
I have so rationally considered his felonious activi-
ties while he worked in the basement of the White
House. They disqualify him for any voice in our

government, much less a Senate seat.

In my view, Ollie North is not a politician, or
anyway not just a politician. He is a dangerous
ideologue in the Ayatollah mold. Perhaps this ex-
plains his afﬁnity for Mr. Khomeini. He is a wild-
eyed zealot who appeals to his constituents with an
almost religious fervor.

(“Alex, there you go again. You’re discriminating
against Ollie North just because he is passionate
about being a Christian! You wouldn’t be complain-
ing if it was Martin Luther King, .lr.!” Yeah, I’ve

tive, but I am saying that ignoring all of this, along
with his court convictions (overturned on technicali-
ties) does disqualify you from being a good conserva-
tive. You then become a dupe.

You also disgrace the name of conservative. There
are many conservative elements in my moderate
belief system, but people like Oliver North, Jerry
Falwell and Pat Robertson (W&L ’50) make people
begin to think conservatism has no redeeming values.
They are the new vanguard of intolerance in America.

Poetry provides outlet for sexual energy

GREEN LAND
BE_TSY GREEN

In light of the phenomenal renaissance of interest
in the arts that has been going on at W&L lately, this
week’s edition of my brilliant column will be in the
form of beat poetry of questionable merit. I’m sure
that my beloved sorority sister Sarah Gilbert will love
it. For the full experience, read it in the GHQ while
the wonderful Michelle Richardson offers you
free coffee.

My poem is a fairly recent composition, and it’s all
true except for the parts of it I made up. It’s called
“Abstinence.” Enjoy, and please, drink your
coffee black.

I’m at the weirdest time of my life.

I don’t have a boyfriend (which one of
my friends says is a sign of The Apocalypse.
How I love the way she flatters me)

or a prospect

The last time I was in this position, I was ten.

It’s been depressing the hell out of me.

After watching When Harry Met Sally... twice in
one day

the solution seemed clear.

I have officially vowed to abstain completely

From all thought and activity

Relating to men,

Romance, and especially

Sex.

These things will not even cross my

mind until November 8th, one month
from today.

With any luck, when it’s all over, I will
be cleansed and happy to be me

or whatever.

Later

I never realized how much I think about
sex.

Anything can set me off.

I’m trying to think of new topics of thought:

Some suggestions I’ve received have included wood
working, current events, soap
sculpture, and the fine art of French
cooking.

Thank God I still have to go to class.

If things get rough, I’ll recite lines from The Wizard

of 02.

Later

I went through my CD’s and took out the ones that
might make me think The Unthinkable.

The Wizard of Oz soundtrack remains.

Later

I’m getting varying degrees of support from
my friends.

Steve said, “Right, and Dan wasn’t going to drink
anymore, either.”

Trevor thought it was “Neat, kind of Buddhist—like.”

Jessica is just glad because she gets to keep my Sarah
McLaughlin CD until November 8th.

Most, though, either think I’m kidding

Later

Why the hell am I doing this?

Later

I got the urge to make long distance phone calls.

(I get to keep some urges)

My best friend, who I now call Mrs. Ramos,
tried to warn me of the dangers of shutting
myself off

She quoted a song by Simon and Garfunkel to prove
her point and thev’re on the forbidden list, so

I tuned her out.

And what was I thinking when I called my ex
boyfriend?

I guess I wanted to see_what he thought of the idea

He said things to me that would set me back weeks
if I even put them on paper

I told him I’d be happy to discuss those feelings on
November 8th.

Later

I bought a Winnie the Pooh coloring book to occupy
my idle mind.

“Marigold” is a good color for Pooh Bear.

Later

In another attempt to not think about sex

I went to a poetry reading with my friends.

Big mistake.

Why did I not think about the effect that could have
on me?

Why did I not think about what moves most people
to write poetry

(with the exception of this one)

.It’s sex, of course.

(Although a startling amount of the poems were
about deceased grandmothers.)

Later

Ack! Sex is everywhere.

Every time I turn on the TV, there it is.

The huge Americans Don’t Really Have Sex
Survey just came out. _

My geology professor talked about sex in
class today.

I don’t want to think about it.

“Follow the yellow brick road! Follow the

Later

I had a dream about sex.

Damn. I can’t control my subconscious.

And now I can’t even think about that cool dream.

Not that I’m thinking now about how cool it was,

Because I’m not.

Really.

Cancer Society thanks W&L student volunteers

To the editor:

On behalf of the Rockbridge Com-
munity Unit of the American Cancer
Society, I want to thank over 100 Wash-
ington and Lee students for their assis-
tance and participation in the senventh
annual “Making Strides Against
Cancer” event which took place
last Sunday.

Over $1200 was collected to assist
us in providing programs to prevent

cancer, to continue research, and to
provide service and rehabilitation for
local cancer survivors. Eric Shirley, a
dorm counselor, won the grand prize (a
$40 gift certificate to Southern Inn) for
collecting $176 in pledges prior to
the event.

Thanks to Dean Manning for again
sponsoring the “Sweet Taste of Vic-
tory” contest - 7 of the 11 women on
Tiffany Gagliardi’s hall participated,

and will enjoy lunch at the Willson
Walker house, courtesy of the dean.
Thanks to the entire pledgeclass of
PiKA—theirs was the only male Greek
representation, and they win the $100
prize, courtesy of the IFC.

In particular, these students deserve
special recognition for planning, orga-

Advertisement raises question of ethics

To the editor:

The recent inclusion of a pro-life propaganda
pamphlet in the Phi was inappropriate. My conten- _
tion is not a matter of personal preference for the
“Pro-Life” or “Pro-Choice” stance. Rather, I question
the ethics of your journalism.

The Phi is supported by student dollars which are
budgeted by and Executive Committee whose rule of
funding is that the recipients of moneys be ideologi-
cally neutral. The inclusion of partisan literature in
the Phi is a breach of the spirit of this policy.

The pamphlet was not clearly labeled as an adver-
tisement; rather, it was printed in such a way as to
appear a main feature of the paper. It seemed a symbol
of the preferences of the Phi staff, whose opinions
should be relegated only to an Op-Ed page where it is

dismaying.

clear that subjective ideas are being presented.

The inclusion of this literature violates the spirit
of a liberal arts college. As a publication at a
university whose mission statement advocates open
discourse and free thought, it is your duty to
provide both sides of an argument.

I realize that the Phi must supplement its uni-
versity funding through outside sources. To accept
advertisements from a partisan group, however, is

I hope that in the future such disparities can be

must be provided enough time to examine them prior
to publishing. ‘

At the Phi, we are faced with meeting the costs of
publishing, and the inclusion of political ads is a
significant supplement to our income.

We do not feel that the inclusion of the ad should
signal our support. In fact, our policy on the editorial
page states, “advertising does not reﬂect the opinion
of The Ring-tum Phi or its staff ”

We do regret that the ad was not more clearly
marked as advertising but it did say “Paid
Advertisment” across the top of it. We were not able
to proof it before publishing because of time limits.

“University policy on posting notices” proposed

To the editor:

Now that the Freshman elections are over and we have experienced the apex/
nadir of the proliferation of notices plastered on every conceivable brick and
cornice of our campus, we would like to propose a “University Policy on Posting
Notices” that balances the need to inform people with protecting the beauty of our
historic campus.

Therefore, recognizing that we hace no ofﬁcial authority whatsoever, we
present the following with the hope that all member of the Washington and Lee
community will respect the policy:

Notices should not be posted on any part of the Colonnade including
Newcomb Hall and Tucker Hall. The Colonnade is a National Historic Land-
mark. So is Lee Chapel.

Notices should not be posted on the campus walkways. Thispractice of
taping notices on the walkways is a relatively recent “tradition” at Washington
and Lee. Where it came from, we don't know, but we think it is unsightly, messy,
and should be discontinued.

Notices should not be posted on any of the white columns of campus
buildings. Banners and signs for special events could hang from the co-op
columns.

Notices should not be posted at the co-op white tables and chairs or on
the teak benches on campus.

Notices should not be posted on the campus lampposts.
The organization that posts the notices is responsible for removing all
notices when the event is over.

If these guidelines are followed, there should still be ample space to inform
the W&L community of upcoming events including all campus exterior bulletin
boards, the boards in the dormitories, academic buildings, library, Lenfest
Center, Doremus, Dining Hall, etc. In addition to the existing posting areas,
Student Activities Coordinator Michelle Richardson has installed a central
mailbox system in the Univeristy Center to accomodate over 100 Washington
anand Lee clubs and organizations and improve communication. Furthermore,
Bill Elswick, Director of Buildings and Grounds, is exploring additional
exterior posting areas. Also, perhaps the concept that 50 notices posted all over
campus is somehow more effective than a few creative notices posted in key
areas could be re-examined.

In any case, we know that everyone shares our appreciation for the beauty of
our campus and we hope that a more thoughtful and restrained approach to the
posting of notices will be forthcoming.

Non in cautus futuri.

Water Polo enters tourney

By STEPHEN WILLIARD
Phi Sports Editor

Irony abounds as the Washington and Lee water polo
squad heads toward the close of another year.

Last weekend saw the Generals upset Princeton 11-5
and Villanova 14-12 while losing to host Slippery Rock
25-12 at the Eastern Water Polo Association playoffs at
Slippery Rock last weekend. The Princeton Tigers en-
tered the weekend ranked 16th nationally, but the W&L
Generals left the weekend ranked 19th.

Coach Remillard was optimistic enetering the touma-
ment as he remarked, “I really thought we had a good
chance of beating Princeton last weekend.”

The irony of all this is that while the Generals are on
track for their best finish ever, they are also on track for
their first losing season.

. With a third place finish in the tournament, the Gen-
erals earned a shot at the competing in the Division I
Eastern Championships at Brown next weekend.

“With a win in the first round, we would be one of the
top eight water polo teams on the east coast,” said head

The Generals had the option of competing in either the
Division III or the Division 1 tournament and Remillard
chose the one at Slippery Rock. The Generals have a shot
at qualifying for the Division I Nationals.

Sophomore Pete Sorenson led the assault last week-
end. Against Princeton, Sorenson had three goals along
with four goals and an assist, and chipped in four more
goals against Slippery Rock.

Junior Rich Cober also served notice for the Generals
with three goals and fourassists against Princeton. Against
Villanova, Cober tallied five more goals. All-American
goalie David Silvester recorded 12 saves against only 5
goals against Princeton.

According to coach Remillard, this is the ﬁrst time
that the Generals have been entered in this tournament in
three years.

“There is no one on this team who has played in it,”
said the coach.

Despite theirlosing record, the squad has come through
with a strong team effort and many of their losses were to
ranked teams.

In a season that has seen every fall sports squad have
a successful season, the water polo team has just followed

 

coach Paige Remillard.

IRONICALLY, THE TIME TO START
SAVING FOR RETIREMENT IS WHEN IT LOOKS
LIKE YOU CAN LEAST AFFORD IT.

Cant afford to save for retirement?
The truth is, you can't afford not to.
Not when you realize that your retirement
can last 20 to 30 years or more. You'll want
to live at least as comfortably then as you
do now. And that takes planning.

By starting to save now, you can take
advantage of tax-deferral and give your
money time to compound and grow.
Consider this: set aside just $100 each
month beginning at age 30 and you can
accumulate over $138,2o9* by the time
you reach age 65. But wait ten years and
you'll have to budget $203 each month
to reach the same goal.

enerals’ football crushes Bridgwater squad  

By Scorr BOOKWALTER
Phi Staff Writer

The Bridgewater Eagles were

looking for their fourth win in
the last five contests against
Washington and Lee last Satur-

day, and hoped to capture their

first league victory in the pro-
cess.

Not this time.

The Generals were in no
mood for another upset, and
drubbed the Eagles,_28-3 at
Bridgewater’s Jopson ﬁeld be-
fore 1,800 spectators, the largest

crowd to see W&L on the road

this year,

W&L sent them home un-
happy as they triumphed for the
third time in the last four weeks,
improving their record to 3-4

overall and 1-3 in the Old Do-

minion Athletic Conference.
Bridgewater dropped into sole
possession of last place at 0-8

overall; 0-4 in the conference.

Even though the game turned

into a rout, there were no indica-
tions of that beforehand, consid-
ering Bridgewater’s past mark
against the Generals.

W&L head coach Gary Fallon

warned the team before the game
not to take the Eagles lightly.

‘‘I hate that week more than

any other,” he said. “They al-
ways play tough against Wash-
ington and Lee.”

The Genefals didn’t take long

to jump on top. Less than six
minutes into the game, wide re-
ceiver Jake Kimball snared a 13-
yard touchdown pass from quar-
terback Brooks Fischer to give
W&L a 7-0 advantage.

Bridgewater closed the gap to

7-3 with a 40-yard ﬁeld goal, but
Fischer found the end zone from
one yard out to boost the gap to
14-3 at half-time.

“Brooks is starting to blos-

som and is taking over the lead-

Phi Staff Writer

ership,” Fallon mentioned.

Just as in last week’s game
against Sewanee, the Generals’
defense refused to allow
Bridgewater to get back into the
game in the second half, and the
offense methodically wore out
the Eagles’ defense, ﬁnishing
with a touchdown in each quar-
ter.

Along with Fischer, who ﬁn-
ished 13-22 for 122 yards and
two touchdowns, freshman run-
ning back Seth McKinley and
senior wideout Hayne Hodges
were the main cogs in the W&L
attack.

McKinley continued to sizzle
by topping the 100 yard mark for
the third straight week with a 135
yard effort. The last General to
accomplish that feat was 1985
ODAC Player of the Year Kevin
Weaver.Hodges diced the
Bridgewater secondary,to the
tune of seven catches for 70 yards
for his part of the damage.

McKinley’sone yardTDburst
in the third quarter extended the
margin to 21-3, and William
Propst hauled in a 24 yard touch-
down hurl from Fischeiwith 9:40
remaining in the game to close
the cofﬁn on Bridgewater. The
seniorwide receiverﬁnished with
four receptions for 41 yards and
is currently the leading receiver
in the ODAC.

“We’re playingconsistentball
offensively,” Fallon said. “We
had two twelve play drives for
scores, and we stayed away from
tumoveis.”

While the Generals’ offense
avoided turnovers, the defense
forced them. W&L intercepted
four passes on the afternoon.

Junior Butler Ball picked off
one, as well as having six tackles,
and a ﬁeld goal block. Seniors
Stephen Cox and Jon Wagner
and freshman Chris Watson had
the other picks.

Junior defensive tackle Rob-

ert Hull ravaged Bridgewater for
two sacks and twelve tackles.
Senior linebacker Andrew Coo-
per aided the effort with nine
stops in his ﬁrst start of the year.

The Generals will now be
faced with a road trip to Greens-
boro, North Carolina to meet the
Guilford Quakers. W&L has en-
joyed playing in North Carolina,
as they have won their last four
contests in the state, including a
21-0 shellacking of Guilford in
1992.

This year’s version of the
Quakers differs tremendously
from last year’s 2-8 team, which
edged out the Generals 14-13 in
Lexington. This season, Guilford
is 7-1 overall (3-1 in the ODAC).
However, the Generals can play
spoilers.

A W&L victory Saturday
would knock Guilford out of the
ODAC race and hand the title to
Emory and Henry. The Quakers
lead the series with W&L 4-3.

“Offensively, they ’re the best
people we’ve faced so far,” Fallon
commented. “Their skill people
are very good.” _

The ‘skill players’ Fallon is
referring to are freshman run-

ning back David Heggie, who is ‘

running away with the rushing
title with a total of 963 yards,
sophomore quarterback Santes
Beatty,wholeadsthe ODACwith
1,132 yards passing, and fresh-
man wide receiver Junior Lord,
who is currently second to Propst
in receptions. As if that were not
frightening enough, the Guilford
defense is only allowing a stingy
13.6 points per game.

Despite all this, Fallon thinks
that the Generals as a whole are
now playing the kind of football
they’re capable of playing.

‘‘I’m glad to see we’re gener-
ating offense, and the defense is
staying in there,” he said. “We
can always strive to be even bet-
ter, though.”

Tory and Jason expound upon
everything; football, hockey...

The men’s soccer team concluded what should be viewed as a
pretty successful season on a down note, as they were unable to give
their graduating seniors a win as a going away present, recording a
4-1 loss to the Keydets of VMI. The loss gives the Generals a .500
record at 7-7-2.

The Generals faced an uphill battle from the beginning, as they
played their only game of the year against a Division I team.

Coach Rolf Piranian knew heading into the game what a struggle
it would be for his scrappy but outgunned bunch.

Against Division I teams like VMI, commented Piranian, ‘‘It is
going to be very physical. You either have to get rid of the ball or get
creamed.”

Due to this difference in playing style, Piranian knew that “...our
kids are going to have to make adjustments to play them.”

Coming off a disappointing loss in the Old Dominion Athletic

197th pick, Gus Frerote, and the Wash-
ington Redskins. The Redskins actually
gave the high-ﬂying Birds a contest.
Gus Frerote was mediocre in the matchup,
as the Eagles beat their NFC opponents
for the 5th time in a row in the last minute
of the game. Randall “wanna-be Doug
Williams” Cunningham calmly and
collectedly led the Eagles on a last minute
march setting up Eddie “Money” Murray
to kick the game-winning ﬁeld goal.

they look to make a run at the Dallas

Women’s soccer loses heartbreaker to Va. Wesleyan

By JOSHUA HESLINGA
Phi Staff Writer

The ride came to an end-for

the W&L women’s soccer team
last Friday against nemesis Vir-
ginia Wesleyan, by another heart-
breakingly close margin.

The only goal of the game
came a bare 26 seconds into the
second half, as the ball managed
to skip through the Generals’

ing distance, but the Marlins’
successful defensive time-con-

ally thought we outplayed them.
No matter how many times I
look back on it, we still did ev-
erything right but score.”

The loss was the second one
goal defeat at the hands of the
Marlins this season, ending the
team’s season at a strong 10-5
record overall (including the tour-

nament), and 6-2 in the ODAC
(not including the tournament).

Looking back at the season,
however, there is little room for
pessimism. This season was
Hathom’s best at W&L, improv-
ing her career record to .500 at
59-59-9 overall and to 34-24-6 in
the ODAC.

For her players, it was equally
successful. The team set or tied

phenom Erica Reineke.

KA robbed, Lee portrait taken

By ETHAN KRUPP
Phi News Editor

Robert E. Lee disappeared from the Kappa
Alpha house on Wednesday night.

A large portrait of Lee and a framed copy of
an old KA Ritual chant were removed from the
first ﬂoor living room, according to Alan
Schoellkopf, president of KA. In addition, food
was scattered and smeared around in the dining
room of the house.

Schoellkopf said at about 12:45 a.m. on
Thursday morning, he heard a number of people
downstairs on the main ﬂoor of the house. He
soon heard “several of the sophomores talking
on the upstairs hall about the picture
being missing.”

The group of roughly 20 people who
Schoellkopf heard were students visiting from
another chapter. lt is not clear whether these
students are responsible for the theft, but Mike
Young, Director of Security for Washington
and Lee, said he “got a lead pointing to students
from an area college.” Young declined to name

the college.

KA Housemother Mary Taylor said sopho-
more Richard Thomas “heard people leaving
through the front door and saying ‘We better
run. We better hurry.”’

House Manager Whit Morris said he and
Schoellkopf went out and cruised around Lex-
ington looking for the group that had been at the
house. Unfortunately, the group could not
be found.

“The portrait of Lee was a [modern] copy of
the painting in Lee Chapel. [It] was valued at
$1800 dollars,” said Schoellkopf. The other
item stolen was a “nicely framed copy of an old
KA Ritual chant.”

The chant had “recently been given to the
house by an alum[nus],” said Schoellkopl‘.‘Tay-
lor said the chant was from “1977 when the
house reopened,” after being dormant for sev-
eral years.

Taylor said “food was smeared, and bread
scattered around.” She said there was no real
destruction to the dining room, just a big mess
made.

Right now, the KAs iust want the picture and

chant back.

“Our number one concern is to get the prop-
erty back,” said Matson Roberts, KA Housing
Corporation President. He and Schoellkopf also
alluded to the theft of KA’s charter last
spring term.

“This is the second time in six months we’ve
had something stolen from the house,”
Schoellkopf said.

The original charter of the Alpha Chapter of
KA was stolen last spring term, most likely
during the course of a sorority formal held at the
house according to both Schoellkopf
and Taylor. .

Roberts and Schoellkopf expressed the hope
that the theft was merely a prank and not a
real theft.

‘‘I would hope it is not someone who has
something in for the KAs,” said Roberts.

Schoellkopf said the theft does not seem that
unusual because minor theft sometimes occurs
at the house.

“Being the Alpha Chapter, we get visited by
so many chapters. lt’s not unusual to get people
taking souvenirs.”

Freshman cars were vandalized this
past weekend, and the number of bike
thefts has been rising.

Five cars parked in the freshman
parking lot were vandalized between 7
p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 5, and the fol-
lowing Monday morning, according to
Mike Young, director of security for
Washington and Lee University. All of
the cars had either radio antennas bent
or broken or windshield wipers bent or
broken. One car was also entered and
suffered damage to the turn signal and
the gearshift.

Freshman Megan Johnson’s car, a
classic 1964 Rambler, suffered the
most damage.

“On the outside, the radio antenna
was broken off and a windshield wiper
was bent way back,” said Johnson.
Since the doors of her car do not lock,
the vandals entered her car and
“wrapped the turn signal lever around
the steering column.” She also said

 

“[the vandals] kicked the gearshift so it
jammed up the gears and her transmis-
sion shaft.”

She estimated the damage to her car
to be at least $200 to $250, but also said
it may be much more by the time she is
done having it repaired.

She did not discover that hercar had
been vandalized until she went out to
drive it at about 12 noon on Tuesday,
Nov. 8. When she went to W&L Secu-
rity to report the vandalism, she dis-
covered her car was already on a list of
damaged cars.

“It made me a little upset,” that
security did not inform her of the dam-
age to her car.

Young said the ﬁve cars damaged
were in “close proximity to each other,
but other than that, there is
no connection.”

Lexington Police Chief Bruce Beard
said at the present time the police have
no leads or suspects. He also said, “it’s
a shame no one has anything better
to do.”

Recently, an increasing number of
bicycles are being stolen, both on cam-

pus and around town, according to
Young. In the past several months, six
to eight bicycles have been stolen.

“Recently, we’ve had a rash of bike
thefts, so lock your bike up,”
said Young.

He said those bikes locked up are
generally not messed with.

Beard said the series of thefts may
be related to a similarseries of thefts
that occurred last spring term. He ad-
vised students to “please secure the
bikes or take them inside.”

He also asked that students notify
the police and security when their bi-

cycles are stolen, so if the bicycles are '
recovered, the police can return them. ~

Beard said the police currently have
several bicycles in their possession,
but they do not have reports on them, so
they can not contact their owners. If
your bicycle was stolen, please check
with the police.

Anyone with any information con-
cerning either the vandalism or the
bicycle thefts, should call either the
Lexington Police Department at 463-
2112, or W&L Security 463-8999. ~

“A lot of ‘drunk pledges doing
goofy stuff.”

That’s how the emcee, Greg Lynch,
characterized Kappa Alpha Theta’s
fifth annual Gong Show.

The acts ranged from Theta ’s parody
of “it’s a Hard—l(nock a Day” from the
musical Annie to Beta Theta Pi’s ren-
dition of Salt n’ Pepa’s “None of
Your Business.”

The Gong Show benefits the

Rockbridge Area Recreation Organi-
zation and Court Appointed Special
Advocates, Theta’s national
philanthropy.

Sigma Phi Epsilon captured first
place with their medley of popular al-
ternative music tracks. They enter-
tained the audience with such hits as
“lt’s the End of the World” by R.E.M.,
“Alone” by Pearl Jam, “The Sweater
Song” by Weezer and “Everybody
Hurts” also by R.E.M. Second place
went to Phi Delta Theta with their
version of Michael Jackson’s
“Beat It.’’

The fastest Gong Award went to

Kappa Sigma for attempting to per-
form “99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall.”
They were gonged off stage before
they could ﬁnish the song title.

The judges were Michelle
Richardson, the Student Activities
Coordinator, Dennis Manning, Dean
of Freshmen, and Brian Richardson,
Professor of Journalism.

Door prizes were awarded through-
out the night with gifts ranging from a
Wilson Walker dinner-for-two coupon
to a gift certiﬁcate from T.G.l.F.

Four Washington and Lee students were
charged with open burning, a Class
One Misdemeanor.

The charge resulted from a ﬁre lit at some
point during the Penthouse 500, a bike race
by freshman on the cheapest bikes they
could find, according to senior
Walker Mitchell.

Mitchell, along with John Rowe, ’95,
Marcus Rayner, ’97 and Compton Biddle,
’95, were all charged because of the ﬁre.
Mitchell said the police charged the four of
them since they were the only residents of
the “Penthouse,” a student residence at 206
N. Randolph, present at the time. In addi-
tion, no one came forward to accept

Lexington Police Chief Bruce Beard said
when the police arrived in reponse to calls
from neighbors of the Penthouse, they “found
some type of bonﬁre burning and a group of
students on the sidewalk in front of
the yard.”

“The bonﬁre contained wood, gas, and
the piled—upbikes fromthe race,” said Beard.

Both Rowe and Rayner said they were
not present when the ﬁre was lit. Raynersaid
he saw the ﬁre and “ran all over the apart-

Rowe said he came outside as people
were trying to put the ﬁre out.

Students approve of Dean of Fun

After last year’s controversy, no seems to mind Richardson’s presence

By JOANNA Soro
Phi Staff Writer

With the semester already half over, the new
coordinator of student activities seems to have
given Washington and Lee students lives a little
more pleasure.

Michelle Richardson has been hard at work
s that we might play. She has offered an
alternative to the basements of fraternity houses
and the movies.

When the administration proposed hiring
someone to organize social activities most stu-
dents believed that it was unnecessary and
waste of money. There was also some concern
that fraternities would lose popularity if there
were other social options. That has not been the
case. Fraternities are just as strong as before,
but now there are more options to choose from.

It appears now that the general opinion has
swayed to favor Richardson’s impact. Students
who have attended the events are pleased-with
the variety that is offered.

Looking to years past, most students agree
this is long past due. The Greek organizations
were not meeting all the needs of the students,
and Lexington is not big enoughto support
clubs or other places to unwind.

Richardson has managed to do the impos-
sible. She has organized events that appeal to
all factions of the student body. The events are
attended by fraternity and sorority members,
independents, and faculty members. The Acous-
tic Coffeehouse on Friday nights has been a
tremendous success with attendance around
100 people. It features student and professional
musicians performing as the audience lingers
over their favorite coffee.

Junior Chris Buford commented on the ben-
eﬁts of the Acoustic Coffeehouse.

“I think it is a really good idea because it
provides good music that’s not a loud frat-party
basement band,” Buford said.

Sophomore Sasha Hartman applauded the
administration for hiring Richardson and being
sensitive to the students’ changing needs.

“I think it’s important to have an individual

who is solely responsible for student activi-
ties,” Hartman said.

Senior Lise Brown used her perspective as a
dorm counselor to shed some light on the issue. I
“There are a lot of freshman who want an;
alternative to fraternity parties. They are al-f

ready tired of the same things every weekend,”
Brown said.

“lt’s nice to have other options for people.

who are not really into the fraternity ordrinking

scene,” said freshman Katharine McFall.
Junior Gray Hancock thinks that having

some of the activities in the GHQ is a good idea.
“Utilizing the Pit is a really smart thing to

do. It’s purpose was to be a social center

outside of the fraternity system, but it was never
used until now.”

‘‘If you put together good music and good
drinks, people will come,” Hancock said. “lt
seems that people really want a change.”

“As an independent, I think it’s great that
they’re organizing something as an alternative

Serbian plane ﬁres on Bosnia

A warplane ﬂown either by Bosnian or Croatian Serbs fired a single
rocket into the Bosnian town of Bihac on Thursday. Bihac is in one of the
regions designated by the United Nations as a safe area. It is not clear
whether the plane was in Bosnia or Croatia when it ﬁred the missile.
Ofﬁcials will not speculate on how NATO or UN forces may respond to the
attack.

Iranians bomb base in Iraq

Iranian jet ﬁghters bombed an Iranian Kurdish Base in Iraq on Thursday.
At least one person was killed and three wounded. This was the second in
recent attacks from dissidents working out of Iraq. This weekend, Iranians
ﬁred missiles into a camp operated by another Iranian opposition group. It
is not expected that Thursdays air strike will draw retaliation from Iraq.

Haiti swears in new Cabinet

Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide finally has a Prime Minister
and a full cabinet, after a month of consultations. Tuesday morning, Prime
Minister Smarck Michel and his Cabinet took oaths of office and pledged

Republicans rejoiced this week at winning control of both the House and
the Senate for the ﬁrst time in 40 years. Republicans across the country won
landslide victories in Tuesday’s election. The GOP gained 49 representa-
tives, raising their total to 227, compared to the 199 Democrats and one
independent. The gains were most dramatic among governors, raising the
total to 31 Republicans, 18 Democrats and one independent.

FAA bans autopilot for planes ﬂying into ice

The FAA on Thursday barred airlines that ﬂy planes similar tome one
that crashed in Indiana last week from using autopilot during icy conditions.
Officials say if the plane that crashed had been under manual control, the
pilot would have noticed the icing problem. Last week’s plane crash killed
all 68 people on board.

Astronauts lookingfor ozone clues

The astronauts aboard the space shuttle Atlantis for the third time this
week monitored the Sun to look for clues to the diminishing ozone layer and
global warming. The astronauts must track the naturally occurring solar
energy changes, which can be tedious. So far the astronauts have made no
new discoveries, but are gathering information to use with future ozone
measurements. The Atlantis is scheduled to return on Monday.

Ito eases juror restrictions

Judge Lance Ito told the 12 regular jurors in the 0.]. Simpson case, as
well as the 15 prospective alternates, that they could now watch television
and, with caution, read newspapers. The only unrestricted television pro-
gramming jurors can watch is channels of old movies, home shopping
programs, _and wildlife shows. Those who watch any other programming
must be prepared to mute the volume in the event that information about the
Simpson case is relayed on the television. Under Ito’s relaxed order, jurors
and candidates must avoid radio, all newsprograms, talk shows, an enter-
tainment magazines.

Robb defeats North; 10 reps are re-elected

Democratic candidate Charles Robb won election to a second term in the
US Senate in Tuesday’s election. Television networks declared the victory
about 90 minutes after the polls closed. Robb received 47 percent of the
vote, Republican candidate Oliver North received 41 percent of the vote,
while the independent candidate received 12 percent. Ten out of 11 Virginia
representatives were re-elected to the House on Tuesday.

Forest fire jumps containment lines

A forest ﬁre thought to be under control on Monday jumped containment
lines early Tuesday morning and forced the evacuation of houses in Stanley.
The ﬁre from Monday consumed about 250 acres and had been declared
under control. Winds caused the ﬁre to jump its containment lines. The ﬁre
spread so easily dueto a 30 percent drop in humidity and the quality of fuel
it fed on. The area is loaded with dead pine trees, killed recently by a
plague of beetles.

Robb Win proves campus polls Wrong

By MICHAEL HEwLE1T
Phi Staff Writer

Although 13 mock elections at vari-
ous Virginia colleges went to Oliver
North, Virginia voters chose incum-
bent Sen. Charles Robb. On election
night Robb won 46 percent of the vote
over North’s 43percent. In a mock elec-
tion a couple of weeks ago, North beat
Robb with 59 percent of the vote.

Many Washington and Lee students
thought Robb won because he was
perceived as the better of the
two candidates.

Senior Paul Wright said he was sur-
prised about the results.

“Either one of them would have
done a good job in Washington,” he
said. ‘‘It came down to ‘who do I
hate more.”’

, > Junior Jennifer Fern thought‘ the
lesser of the two evils was North.

“As our honor system at W&L says,
we do not tolerate lying, cheating, and
stealing,” Fern said, “but I feel that’s
what both candidates did.”

to the campaign.

Washington, it was so gratifying to see
the presence of three political parties as
opposed to two,” she said. ‘‘It demon-
strates the variety of thought that exists
in American society. It should be a
great wakeup call to Bill Clinton who
can no longer rely on one party to pass
legislation.”

College Republican president Dou-
glas Thiessen said he was upset at
North’s loss but believes North de-
serves credit for his campaign.

“I think Ollie did a good job and
deserves to be commended for bring-
ing together many people on issues that
so many Virginians care about,”

he said.

Thiessen said Robb supporters in
Northern Virginia, Richmond and Tide-
water came out in extraordinary
numbers.

“Geographically, North won over
75 percent of the state but the numbers
of those areas were not enough (to elect
North),” he said.

Nova Clarke said North’s reputa-
tion as a liar contributed to his defeat.

“I think people couldn’t deal with
Oliver North,” she said. “They couldn’t
deal with someone without
any principles.”

Junior Richard DiDonna said the
Republican Party would have been in
trouble if North was elected.

“I think it’s good for the Republi-
cans not to have North, considering it
could cause the Republican Party

-trouble in 1996 in terms of ideology.”
 .. Sophomore Elizabeth Cox believed

the race would be close.

“I really think it could have gone
either way,” he said.

Although she was excited for Robb,
she said she was turned off by the
politics.

“I like Robb,” she said, “but the
only thing that bothered me was last
night watching him gloat over his vic-
tory. I guess that’s just the politician
in him.”

Sophomore Rachelle Rowe said it
would have been a mistake if North
had won.

“I think a lot of people would real-
ize after having North in Senate fortwo
years that it was a bad idea,” she said.

She said American voters are frus-
trated with the government.

“People are fed up with government
and for good reason—so they’re ready
for change,” Rowe said. “But just elect-
ing a new candidate doesn’t necessar-
ily mean things will get better.”

Both kids and tutors benefit from Adopt-a-School

By JENNIFER LATHAM
Phi Staff Writer

Last month 39 students at Mountain View El-
ementary got treats that will last longer than those
from their Halloween bags.

The “treats” are Washington and Lee students
who began tutoring the students through the Adopt-
a-School program in early October. The Adopt-a-
School program is a nationwide organization of
volunteers who help students at rural primary schools.

Tutors not only help students with schoolwork,
but they also become “buddies” to them. Teachers at
Mountain View especially encourage the “buddy
system,” because most students whom they choose to
get tutors have difﬁcult home lives.

Mountain View became one of more than 90
primary schools nationwide to participate in the
program after Adopt—a-School representatives spoke
with Principal Lewis Straub last summer. Straub then
signed Mountain View up for the program after
discussing it with W&L senior Kit Dodds
in February.

Dodds told Straub she would recruit volunteers
forthe program as chairman of campus and commu-
nity involvement in Pi Beta Phi sorority.

Adopt-a-School representatives told Dodds that
Mountain View needed tutoring help more than any
other Rockbridge County elementary school. But

Straub worried that Mountain View’s distance from
W&L would discourage potential volunteers.iMoun-
tain View is about a 10-minute drive from East Lex
grocery store on Route 11.

But the drive has not stopped W&L sophomore
Winston Chapman from visiting Casey, a ﬁfth-grader,
every Thursday. (Casey is not the student’s
real name.)

Casey said he looks forward to “going outside and
playing” with Chapman each week. Last week the
two played on the playground swings and slide as
they talked about the “Lion King” soundtrack Casey
ordered through a Scholastic book sale.

Chapman said the visit went smoothly until he
asked Casey about his Halloween plans. Casey told
him he could not go trick-or-treating at his
grandmother’s house because other family member
had found his uncle using cocaine there.

Casey also said he hadn’t carved a pumpkin this
year. He said his dad refuses to buy a gourd only to
throw most of it away in removing the pulp.

Pumpkin or no pumpkin, Chapman said Casey is
lucky to have a father who seems to take good care of
him. Casey’s father is physically disabled, and his
mother lives in a mental institution.

Chapman said taking a developmental psychol-
ogy class helped him understand Casey’s behavior
resulting from his family situation.

“He really has a hard time laughing, smiling, and
expressing himself,” said Chapman. “He needs

_ . __Phi Staff Writer

     

  

   

somebody that he can come out of his shell with.”

Chapman said he wants to help Casey deal with
his emotions but has trouble talking about Casey’s
home life with him.

“[Casey] is coming from a completely different
world, and I’m having to respond to this,” said
Chapman. “He brings up a lot ofsubjects that I’m not
sure how to deal with.”

But Straub said as long as Adopt-a-School tutors
do not react negatively to students’ concerns, the
“buddy system” benefits the students.

“These children are going to be introduced to
people from all walks of life,” Straub said. Straub
said Mountain View students see W&L students as
role models after getting to know them personally.

“I always feel that one-on-one tutoring is benefi-
cial,” said Straub. “[W&L students] are spending
time with the kids, not just running in and out.”

Dodds said Mountain View teachers and staff
show appreciation for the volunteers and recognize
the challenges of tutoring.

“The school has been great about realizing that the
program may be a little rocky at the start,” Dodds
said. “They’ve been fantastic about helping us out.”

Straub said he wants to continue the Adopt-a-
School program at Mountain View indefinitely.

“I think [students] need to see that giving of your
time and talents is an important part of life, not
something you lose before age 21.” Straub said.

Washington and
Lee prides itself on
its sense of tradition,
and W&L trademarks such

as the collonade and the
honor code never change

radically, but evolve and-

adapt slowly as time passes.

So it seems with W&L fashions —
the basicswill always prevail, and while
students look good, they generally shun
the cutting edge in styles.

Forthe Washington and Lee gentle-
men, this is especially true, as fashions
for them change so little anyway.

And for all but the trendiest women
at W&L, tastes vary, but styles change
slowly — they prefer a classic look
-tested overtime to look good.

From the feet up, here is a look at

Tasteful skirt and sweater combinations

what W&L women can expect to see in
the coming months, but there are no big
surprises.

For the feet, shoes like loafer-style
ﬂats, bucs, penny loafers, and lug-sole
oxfords are a good choice, both cute
and practical. Boots are a must as well:
cowboy styles, duck boots and hiking
boots are all good choices. Running
shoes and sneakers reminiscent of
growing up in the ‘80s, like Tretoms
and Converse All-Stars, are a natural
choice. Mary Jane styles or strappy
pumps (for a sleeker look) are cute
shoes to watch for. The time,

Shoes,

Perennial favorites are argyles and plain

however, are those that are Melrose

For tops, the choices are many, but
ﬁne gauge sweaters are even more

when dressing in layers for parties or

It has been argued that Bob Dylan is the most
inﬂuential musical artist of the latter half of the
twentieth century. More than thirty years after
the release of his ﬁrst album, Dylan is still
going strong. Currently on the Eastern U.S. leg
of his 1994 tour, Dylan recently played to sold
out houses in both Washington, D.C. and
Roanoke.

The venue for Dylan’s stop on Halloween
was the picturesque Warner Theater in down-
town D.C. Dylan and his band took the stage
promptly at eight and hurriedly tore through
two songs before ripping into a blistering ver-
sion of “All Along the Watchtower.” Dylan, as
he does with most of his songs in concert,
deviated from the original, firing off the lines to
the song in pairs. The band promptly changed
genres, delivering a version of “I’ll Be Your
Baby Tonight” that sounded as if it were straight
from Nashville.

Highlights of the show included an amaz-
ingly bitter acoustic version of “Masters of
War.” Dylan seemed to direct this harsh con-
demnation of‘govemment to the town itself.

Returning to the electric format after a brief
three songs, Dylan performed several more
tunes, including “Highway 61,” before ﬁnish-
ing with “Maggie’s Farm.” As he left the stage
he appeared a bit tipsy, mockingly pointing at
the crowd.

The crowd didn’t seem to mind Dylan’s
antics, and stayed on its feet until the band

m%V‘\

reappeared. Dylan played an amazing version
of “Like A Rolling Stone” before pausing once
again to mimic the fans cheering wildly from
the ﬂoor. He then returned to the acoustic
format and delivered an incredibly harsh ver-
sion of “It Ain’t Me, Babe.” Vocally attacking
his own audience, Dylan grated out a bitter,
sardonic end to the evening.

Two nights later in Roanoke, Dylan per-
formed an entirely different show. Not visibly
intoxicated as he had been in D.C., he changed
the playlist, including such hits as “Mr. Tam-
bourine Man,” as well as his concert standards
“Senor” and “Gates of Eden.”

The highlight of the Roanoke show oc-
curred near the end. As Dylan again closed
with “Maggie’s Farm,” a girl from the audience
jumped onstage and began to dance. Soon
others followed, and by the end of the song
nearly thirty fans, mostly teenage females, were

Mary Shelley ’s Frankenstein - 12775:’ 1/2

Despite this Halloween’s Mighty Morphin
Power Rangers, one of the most enduring crea-
tures in our collective imagination is that lum-
bering semi-human, Frankenstein.

Most of us remember him as a tall green guy
with a crew cut and bolts sticking out of his
neck. .
By now, this image is probably likely to
inspire humor instead of fear.

But Kenneth Branagh’s new movie, Mary
Shelley ’s Frankenstein, takes a different tack,
more faithful to the original text. Here the
monster inspires neither laughter nor fright, but
pity.

As expected, the young Victor Frankenstein
(Kenneth Branagh himself) goes off to med
school and begins asking all the wrong ques-
tions.

After the unfortunate death of his mother,
he wants to bring the dead back to life, to re-
animate the dead, to create life anew.

This he unfortunately manages to do, creat-
ing an absolutely hideous creature (which looks

more akin to an evil Raggedy Andy than to the
Addams Family’_s Lurch).

Realizing the mistake he has made, Fran-
kenstein leaves the creature to his own wits and
hopes he will die in the plague sweeping the
country-side.

Naturally, the Monster (Robert De Niro) is
more than a little annoyed at this lack of pater-
nal love; things only get worse after he discov-
ers how much the world abhors him, since he’s
so ugly. '

He pursues his creator to exact vengeance
and demands a wife of equal ugliness to be his
companion.

Frankenstein and his Monster end up chas-
ing each other around, ﬁnally winding up on the
Arctic Sea. -

This ﬁlm will not live up to your expecta-
tions, but it’s sort of difﬁcult ﬁguring out ex-
actly why.

For one thing, the movie attempts to incor-
porate too much plot into two hours.

The ﬁrst twenty or thirty minutes are spent
telling of Victor’s early life, his initial experi-
ments with electricity, the death of his mother,
and other semi-interesting material.

That leaves barely enough time for the story
of the Monster.

In the end, the movie seems very rushed,
hectic and sketchy.

What becomes the movie’s saving grace (to
the extent that it has one), is the acting. Branagh
goes half the movie without a shirt, which
makes him look slightly ridiculous, but other
than that his acting is ﬁne.

The supporting cast is quite good, including
Helena Bonham Carter (A Room with a View)
and Tom Hulce (Amadeus).

One person to look for especially is John:
Cleese, who does a surprisingly good job as Dr.;
Frankenstein’s mentor, Dr. Waldman. 3

But the man who takes the cake is Bobby De;
Niro himself. ;

He is absolutely coated under layers and
layers of makeup - but still manages to express
the tragedy and sorrow of his character. 1

This ﬁlm really isn’t so bad, but it could
have been so much better. I

The trailer makes the ﬁlm look more excit-l
ing than it is; its biggest problem is that it’s a let
down.The story is rushed and the directing
melodramatic. '

But the underlying story-line and the decent
enough acting make it interesting. And, the
sumptuous costumes and sets make it a visual
treat .I wouldn’t suggest that you rush off to see
Frankenstein, but it’s worth at least a video
rental or the drive-in. 7

Rating Scale

‘A'*:}i‘:{r - Go buy this as soon as it comes out on video.
It is an instant classic. “You'll laugh; you’ll cry; and maybe,
just maybe, you’ll learn something about yourself.”

ﬁﬁﬁ - Go see this ﬁlm now, while it’s still on the big
screen. it’s worth a few Oscar nominations and the seven
bucks you’ll pay if you see it outside Lexington. Overall,
“Better than Cats!”

ﬁﬁ - Okay, so there have been better ﬁlms. Neverthe-
less, it is a good example of its genre, and you should
probably see it on videotape. Still, probably “Better than
Cats!”

13' - It happens to be on HBO, and you’re blowing off
tomorrow ’s reading. Although your time would probably be
better served on your education, its free and you’re bored, so
go ahead and watch it.

9 — Even if its free and your best friend said he never
laughed harder, trust me, this one sucks. Don't waste your
time, or at least don’t waste it on this. ('l1iere’s always
MTV.)

The coffee was hot and good to the last drop.
It was like an old friend, bittersweet and re-
freshing. Although it may have singed a few
tongues, it was an integral part of the atmo-
sphere; had it been absent, the function would
practically havgggﬁsed sgggggtist. Some took it
with sugar,’othqa~wI~itli~ ereaim, still others took
both. The ‘real"me'r‘I, however took it straight
black.

We are speaking of course of yet another
GHQ acoustic coffee house sponsored by stu-
dent activities and the society for the arts. The
scene was ripe for soulful back to back perfor-
mances by student performers Cooper Harris
and the trio of David Olympio, Dan Vesay, and
Todd Bryan.

The show commenced last Friday evening
within the dark pit of the GHQ approximately
ten minutes after its scheduled starting time of
nine o’clock with a unique introduction of the
ﬁrst performer, Cooper Harris. The impromptu
announcer, whose identity was never discov-

as. .. _M,,.

proves it.

When complaints about the new al-
bum like “you can’t hear Boyd” are heard, the
reply is always “you’ve got to see them LIVE.”
For all of those who had never seen the show
until Wednesday, now you know what we meant.

And to all of you who were disappointed for
whatever reason with Under the Table and
Dreaming , take it for what it was meant to be:
a studio album. One thing that makes the band
so great is the different sounds they have. The
studio can make the songs sound a little differ-
ent. Dave said himself that they got some great
screams onto the album, and they did. How-
ever, the screams from the Horse Center were
heard all the way back at RCA.

On the anniversary of the release of
their ﬁrst album, Remember Two Things, The
Dave Matthews Band returned to us here in Old
Virginia where it all began only three short
years ago. We all know that Wednesday nights
at W&L mean something special, but this week
was a little different: Dave and his band were
back. The greatest part is, is that they knew that

ered, delivered a rambling tirade that essen-
tially made no point but nevertheless set the
stage for an emotional opening number by
Harris.

Playing an acoustic guitar, Harris tenta-
tively crooned his way through the ﬁrst couple
of songs, warming to the crowd and gaining
conﬁdence with each note. Though the hall
was sparsely populated at ﬁrst by friends and
acquaintances, gradually it began to ﬁll as
interested parties sporadically wandered in,
drawn by the allure of the music and the aroma
of freshly brewed coffee. Soon Harris was
wailing and moaning his way through a set of
blues and classic rock standards, covering the
likes of Dylan, Elvis, Robert Johnson, and even
U2. The set also included ﬁve original songs.

Of his first solo performance, Harris, who
has been playing for three years and partici-
pated in a rock and roll band in high school,
conceded that overall he was pleased, despite
some glitches such as forgetting words and
breaking a string while playing slide. He also
wanted to stress how much he appreciates his
fans.

As Harris wound down, audience response

He again closed with “It Ain’t Me, Babe.”
However, instead of the bitter, berating version
he sang in D.C., the song almost became fa-
therly advice. “lt ain’t me babe. It ain’t me
you’re looking for,” Dylan chided his fans who,
climbing back onstage, seemingly took no no-
tice.

Dylan finished the song and paused for
several seconds as if, even after all this time,
mystified by the entire scene. then, he calmly
walked offstage, and presumably onto his tour
bus, heading down the road to play another
show and leave his mark as he has been doing
for so many years.

Lambda Chi Alpha
collects food for needy

Their annual food drive is a success

By DAN ODENWALD

Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity is busy helping Lexington’s needy. They recently conducted a
week-long food drive that assisted Total Action Against Poverty (TAP). TAP is a Rockbridge
county group that is committed to helping the area’s poor. Fraternity members placed donated
Harris-Teeter plastic grocery bags on city residents’ doors and solicited donations.

lambda Chi Vice President, John Bator, organized the event. Each year Lambda Chi Alpha

, solicit canned items and non-perishable goods from the community’s residents.

, TAP intends to distribute the collected items to members of the community along with
j donations from other non-related food drives. The Lambda Chis also asked local businesses to
" support their philanthropy effort by donating cash contributions. They were successful in their
?drive and received over 1700 pounds of canned foods. This amount exceeded the national
: fratemity’s projected goal for their Washington and Lee chapter.

p Sophomore Hank Cosby believes the food drive is worthwhile because it helps the fratemity’s

2 relationship with the community.

Cosby said, “The food drive was an important way to give back to the Lexington community.
i Most people were receptive and familiar with the project.”
Cosby also said that the Lambda Chi food drive will continue next year and hopefully become

i an annual event.

Some Lexington residents used the food drive as an impetus to clean out their pantries. Included
’ in the standard cans of tuna and peas were some rather strange items. Perhaps the strangest of these
donations, donated by an overly enthused participant, was a jar of crayfish sauce.

they were back, they knew they were home. To
quote the man himself “Virginia is cool.” The
show itself was one of the best many of us has
seen. How many times do we get to hear “Say
Good-bye” and “Cry Freedom Cry” anyway?

For all of us who remember that the
lyrics for “Satellite” started out as a song called
“After Her”, or saw him play with Tim Reynolds
in a place called TRAX, we’ve kept passing on
the word about this one band from C’ville;
every time we take someone to their first show
the look on their face says it all.

From the performances at Zollman’s to the
Pavilion, from the UVa amphitheater on Dave
Matthew ’s Day to this Wednesday night’s show
at the Horse Center, we all know that they are
great, and they had what it takes. Dave himself
summed it up best: “Would you not like to be,
sittin’ on top of the world with your legs hangin’
free?” Well friends, we are, and we can here
Boyd and all the rest, playing the music that
makes us smile.

Thanks Dave from all of us, and we’ll see
you soon.

was quite favorable, but nothing compared to
what would follow. Billed as a funk and jazz
trio, Olympio, Vesay, and Bryan opened with a
strong acoustic set, letting various jazz stan-
dards loose from their deep bag of tricks, in-
cluding the ever popular “Kansas City.”

But it was their second set that truly
punctuated their versatility. Electric in both
senses of the word, the set was propelled by a
ic  beat which paved the
.~ ~ r diverseﬁriumbers including samples
from several popular theme songs and
soundtracks. Often the three were content just
to jam away, sweet music protuberating from
their instruments. One member of the audience
later described the playing of the three as phe-
nomenal.

The music was of excellent quality. The
coffee was hot and free-flowing. What more
could the typical W&L music aficionado ask
for? Undoubtedly the student activities asso-
ciation and the society for the arts have a good
thing going. So long as there are students who
want to be heard and other students willing to
listen over a mug of joe, the success of the
acoustic coffee house will continue indefinitely.

Bell explores protesting

By MICHAEL HEWLETT
Phi Staff Writer

Martin Luther King, Jr. once said that if
someone is willing to die for something, he
isn’t ﬁt to live.

Throughout history, people such as King,
Ghandi and Nelson Mandela have risked their
lives to protest an unjust system. Yet, to protest
oftentimes means alienation and ridicule.

When King protested the Vietnam War,
civil rights leaders such as Roy Wilkins and
Bayard Rustin criticized King harshly. King,
however, refused to temper his protest because
he simply believed the war was wrong; he
believed he had an obligation to stand up against
all injustice.

As Derrick Bell argues in his book, Con-
fronting Authority: Reflections of an Ardent
Protester, doing the right thing can be difficult,
dangerous and lonely.

In the 1970’s Bell became the first tenured
black professor at Harvard Law School. Hardly
comfortable with his position, he pressures the
law school to hire more minorities.

Bell argues that the process Harvard used to
select faculty gave an unfair advantage to appli-
cants who graduated from elite schools such as
Yale or Harvard. Harvard ignored the achieve-
ments of an applicant after he graduated. For
example, Harvard would takes someone who
went to Yale over someone who went to Howard
Law School regardless of what practical expe-
rience he had.

Bell argues that this type of selection gave
minority applicants a difficult time.

“The standards for hiring and promoting
faculty at Harvard Law School (and in fairness
at almost every major law school in the coun-
try) erect almost unassailable barriers of class
and race.

Bearing little correlation to effective teach-
ing or signiﬁcant scholarship, the criteria’s
most uniform effect is to produce a group of law
professors whose backgrounds, education, in-
terests, and writing most closely resemble those
of the wealthy white men who have dominated
law faculties since their beginning.”

Black woman have an especially- hard time
being hired by Harvard.

Regina Austin and Anita Allen come to
Harvard Law School, but they are never offered
a position. Bell tries his best to pressure Harvard

to promote diversity and supports student pro-
tests over faculty hiring. When Harvard fails to
offer either Austin and Allen a position, a
frustrated Bell decides to take an unpaid leave
in protest Harvard’s failure to hire a black
woman.

His friends and colleagues desert him, urg- :
ing him to quit this foolishness. People distance ’

themselves from him, perceiving him to be

some insane radical. He wonders if his protest 1

is making things worse or better.

' These are the things that a protester will I

face, Bell argues.

Confronting authority is not going to make ii,

you popular or win you millions of dollars.
Oftentimes, challenging authority will make
you an enemy instead of a friend. .

Bell provides the example of Paul Robeson,
an outspoken activist for global human rights.
He protested African colonialism, Jim Crow,
lynchings, the Korean War and discriminatory
immigration laws.

By the end of his life, he had only $6000 in
his possession. Luminaries such as Jackie
Robinson openly viliﬁed him. He paid the
ultimate price for challenging those in power.

Interspersed with the main narrative, Bell
weaves an allegorical tale about the barriers
between the Citadel and the lowlanders.

The lowlanders protest their treatment, and
the Citadel must seek ways to include them
while maintaining their power.

The story exempliﬁes something King said
once: Those in power never willingly give
freedom and equality, but these things must be
demanded by the oppressed.

Overall, Bell writes intelligently about pro-
testing. He draws on his and others experiences
to show the risks a protester must endure. Yet,
he also shows why we must protest.

If we don’t, then who will? What if Rosa
Parks had never refused her seat to a white
man? What if no one ever opposed Adolph
Hitler or the Vietnam War?

Protesting is an important facet of American
history. Bell makes usthink about our everyday
lives and the number of slights we take without
any reaction. We often think it easier to ignore
rather than confront a wrong. It certainly is.

Yet, Bell makes us wonder where we as a ,
people would be if we didn’t confront author-
ity—whether collectively or individual.

Bell ultimately proves that protesting has an
integral value that surpasses the risks involved

This weekend Habitat for Humanity, a
recent addition to Washington and Lee,
will be sponsoring a six man
volleyball tbumament.

_ Student Activities Coordinator Michelle
Richardson, the F.L.C, Dean Manning, and
Habitat for Humanity all played an integral
role in organizing this event.

Habitat’s primary purpose is to provide
shelter for low income families that need
assistance. This weekend’s tournament is
just one of the many fund raisers planned
throughout the academic year. Presently,
they are amidst a campaign to raise $10,000
to fund the restoration of a house here in
Lexington. Each dollar raised will be
matched by a private organization until they
reach their goal.

Registration for each six person team
costs $18, which will go directly towards
Habitat’s cause.

The tournament will be held in the
Doremus Gym on Sunday from 1-5 p.m. As
an added bonus, participants will receive

sponsors volleyball tourney

free pizzas and soda for their efforts. Pres-
ently, the bulk of the registered players has
come from the various fraternities around
campus.

Kappa Alpha, Phi Kappa Psi, Pi Kappa
Alpha, Phi Kappa Sigma, Beta Theta Pi, and
Sigma Phi Epsilon have all submitted at least
one team into the competition. However,
teams do not have to be afﬁliated with any
organization on campus.

“Anyone who has the time to spare for a
good cause are encouraged to participate”,
said freshman leadership council member
Matt Graves, “and free pizza— how can you
go wrong?”

To register for the competition, contact
Michelle Richardson at 4111 up until 12
noon on Sunday.

“We’ve extended the deadline as late as
possible so we can register as many people
as possible for this event.

If anyone is interested, just leave your
name and telephone number on my voice
mail and bring the $18 registration fee to the
tournament.”

Participants are advised to arrive at least
twenty minutes before the start of the com-
petition to receive their court assignments.

Two new Trustees chosen I

By JOANNA Soro
Phi Staff Writer

The Board of Trustees appointed two new
members, including Washington and Lee’s first
female trustee.

Pamela J. White and William R. Johnston
were appointed to the board during the trustees
meeting on October 28th and 29th. They both
will serve a ﬁve year tenn on the board with the
possibility of being elected to another ﬁve year
term.

Pamela White is a member of the 1977 law
class. She is a partner in the Baltimore law ﬁrm
of Ober, Kaler, Grimes and Shriver. White is
the former president of the Law Alumni Coun-

cil. She also sits on the national steering com-
mittee of the university campaign, On the Shoul-
ders of Giants.

White was awarded the Distinguished Alum-
nae Award last May and the Order of the Coif
by the law school this October.

William Johnston is a member of the class of
1961. He is chairman of LaBranch & Co., a
New York Stock Exchange specialist ﬁrm.
Johnston is the chairman of the Commerce
School advisory board. He is also sits on the
national steering committee of the university
campaign, On the Shoulders of Giants. Johnston
is the son of alumnus H. Reed Johnston, class of
1928.

White and Johnston will be sworn in at the
February meeting of the Board of Trustees.

to the typical W&L social scene,” said junior
Jay White.

Richardson’s ideas are not limited to the
acoustic coffeehouse. Several bands have
already performed in the Pit and Shannon
Worrell performed this past Thursday. A trip
to Washington D.C. also has been planned for
November 13. The trip costs $20 and includes
a ticket for the National Symphony Orchestra.
A dinner theater is scheduled for the 13th of
January in the GHQ. A speaker will give a talk
on male and female sexuality on January 26.

It appears that Washington and Lee stu-
dents are enjoying the new variety of social
activities, and are eagerly awaiting what
Richardson can give us next.

the ﬁre did not come forward, someone had to
be responsible. According to Beard, since the
person who lit the ﬁre could not be found, the
ofﬁcer present charged the house's residents
for the ﬁre. _

Some residents of the house disagreed
with this.

“I’m not reponsible. I was in my room at
the time,” said Rowe.

The race was “a Penthouse event,” accord-
ing to Rayner, who felt that people present
“went out of control.” According to Mitchell,
the participants are required to do 500 laps
around the house in a series of relay teams.
This year, the second year the event has been
held, it was stopped early for some reason.
The bikes were piled up and set on ﬁre after
the race was stopped.

The ﬁre was put out by those present,
according to Lexington Fire Chief Kenneth
“Butch” Hall. ’

“I was notiﬁed of the ﬁre, but not called out
to it,” he said.

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

Housing options:
one of our best traditions?

From the standpoint of fraternity males, the proposed
housing policy is no more than a validation of a common
practice. Nearly every sophomore member of a fraternity
already lives in fraternity housing.

But for the 40 percent of the student body that is female, the
mandatory sophomore housing is rather unfair. Yes, we
know all’s fair in love and war, but this is neither. It could
even be called sexist.

Until sororities have their own houses, a requirement for
sophomores to live in University housing would be targeted
solely to the women on campus.

The University argues that sophomore housing would
keep the students closer to campus and the opportunity for
studying. But, in my four years in Lexington, I have lived in
two different off-campus apartments and in Woods Creek.
Both of my off-campus abodes were closer to the University
Center (my usual place of late—night school work) than the
University housing. One was closer to the library than Woods
Creek. With a plethora of housing available within five
minutes of the Colonnade, this has never been a problem.

Another argument the University is making for the new
plan is that sophomores would have more time to form strong
friendships. With the overwhelmingly social nature of our
student body, this has never been a problem; sophomores
would still have to choose with whom they wanted to live in
suites and apartments, and many off-campus houses and
apartments provide more opportunities for integration into
the community than Gaines or Woods Creek could. Think of
the legendary activities at the Bordello, Aqua Velva, Munster
and the Penthouse.

Also, off-campus housing can provide a very inexpensive
option for those who are under tight budgets. A shared
apartment can be as cheap as $150 a month, including
utilities, and some will give one the option of a nine- or 10-
month lease, for a total which is less than $1500, more than
$300 cheaper than the least expensive on-campus housing.
This is more important for some students than many realize.

v Washington and Lee is well—known for its ﬂexibility and
generous allowances for student life. Many schools ban cars
for freshmen and require housing arrangements much more
stringent than W&L. But that is what we love so much about
our school; its faith in the maturity and responsibility of its
student body. This new proposal would take away from that
basic measure of trust and respect, and would do more harm
than good.

Republican sweep bodes we11for1996

DOUG
TH1EssEN,’95

The Tuesday elections this week
show that America is becoming more
and more conservative, and a
conservative revolution is brewing. Bill
Clinton was elected in 1992 because of
many factors, including opposition to
Bush, but Clinton was still elected on
many conservative ideas, for he was a
“new kind ofDemocrat.” Many voters
in 1992 were indeed upset with the way
Washington was working under Bush,
but even Democrats still opted for a
supposed moderate conservative can-
didate, and since then the American

_ public has been turning the tide toward

conservative candidates. The massive
Republican wins on Tuesday are an
example of this conservative turn.

For several decades, voters have
been electing mostly conservative
Presidents. Finally, with Bill Clinton
giving in to the liberal establishment in
Washington, voters are now even
turning the Congress into a politically
conservative institution.

Throughout the 1980s, many voters
could tolerate their liberal incumbents
because of the pork they brought home
or the power they provided, but in 1992
Bill Clinton was elected as a new kind
of Democrat with new, conservative
and moderate ideas that could
presumably put America back on track.
In 1994, however, voters realized that
re-electing these liberal Democrats
meant more of the same.

Back in 1992, Bill Clinton claimed
that an end to gridlock in Washington
and an end to so-called “divided gov-
ernment” were the answers to
America’s ills. Well, gridlock in Wash-
ington nominally ended, but people are
still dissatisfied with the way the

"'9.

."_,

‘in"cumlie'nts were"

federal government works. The new
kind of conservative Democratic ideas
that Bill Clinton promised did not
materialize, and voters received more
of the same. Amidst all of the political
rhetoric, and,decegti_on,peopleaﬁnally
realized t,ltat,the_s‘e entrenched liberal
the voices they
wanted in Washington, and they
opted overwhelmingly for conser-
vative candidates.

Congress has been politically
conservative for several years now, but
it has remained in Democratic hands
with a liberal leadership. Many of the
Republican wins in both the House and
Senate show an example of the public’s
desire to change this leadership. For
instance, House Speaker Tom Foley, a
long-time liberal Democrat, faced
probably the toughest re-election bid
of the year from newcomer George
Nethercut, a fresh conservative face
that promised real change in
Washington. The race was so close
that many hours after the election, a
winner had not been determined.

Big losses for Democrat incumbents
were House Ways and Means Chair-
man Dan Rostenkowski, powerful
Chairman Jack Brooks of Texas, eigh-
teen-year incumbent Jim Sasser of Ten-
nessee, the most popular Texas Gover-
nor in history, Ann Richards, and the
orator of the left, Mario Cuomo. And
of those liberal Democrats who man-
aged to hold onto their seats in Con-
gress, Majority (soon to be minority)
Leader Dick Gephardt, and perhaps
the biggest symbol of the liberal
establishment, Senator Ted Kennedy,
all squeaked by on Tuesday. Kennedy
won narrowly in the most liberal in
the nation, the People’s Republic
of Massachusetts.

Many pundits say that these races
were tough for these entrenched
incumbents because of the prevailing

“throw the bums out” attitude around
the nation, but these incumbents lost or
faced tough challenges because the
public’s shift towards conservatism.
It is true that somelraces were about

these eté;‘cti'<ms‘v'were 'refer‘eridun'ts'.;ofn’

ment in Washington. Even if the throw

the election, it was a throw the liberal
bums out.

Not one Republican incumbent in
the House or Senate lost his/her
re-election bid, in sharp contrast to the

general could offer their ideas in
sharp contrast to the ideas of the
liberal establishment.
During the 1994 campaign,
Republicans and Democrats alike
, campai nedjwith, economic and social

“family values, and less government
were some of the most popular ideas
advocated by both Democrats and
Republicans. On Tuesday, November
8, 1994, Americans cast their ballots in
an extraordinary election that is just
one more step in the direction of
conservatism for America. It is clear

A member of the Student Body has been found guilty of a violation
of the Honor System in that the student lied regarding the investigation
of an automobile accident. That student has chosen to withdraw from
the University.

Christensen detracts from rational debate, feeds name calling

To the editor.

It always hopelessly muddles rational de-
bate when liberals call conservatives Nazis and
conservatives call liberals Communists. In fact,
these terms have become almost meaningless
through their misuse. In his article, “The Far
Middle,” Alex Christensen calls Oliver North a
“faux-Southem Hitler wannabe.” Come now,

W&L lacks adequate policy on homosexual discrimination

Alex, aren’t we exaggerating a little bit? In the
same article, the author calls Oliver North,
Jerry Falwell, and Pat Robertson the “new
vanguard of intolerance in America.” Intoler-
ance. This is a word leftist politicians like to
throw around in order to curry favor with the
media, and the media like to throw around in
order to preen themselves on their self-pro-

claimed “progressive” viewpoint. Typically,
those who call others “intolerant” do not debate
the slandered persons on particular issues; they
just like to call names. And here in this article,
the author offers no evidence as to the supposed
intolerance of these three men.

I myself am not speaking form a necessarily
conservative viewpoint. Many would call me

far right, some would call me far left, I’m sure,
and others would call me a radical centrist.I dub
myself libertarian; in other words, a proponent
of, “Get the government out.” Liberals wonder
what will happen to the poor, and conservatives
wonder what will happen to morality, without
government interference. Some form of tyr-
anny, in my viewpoint, is not the proper method

for achieving one’s social goals.But back to the 3
original point, I am criticizing those who throw
labels around irresponsibly. We need to stop
criticizing certain personalities and start dis-
cussing specific policies. Otherwise, all politi-
cal debate is virtually useless. ;

To the editor:

I am writing in response to the article in the October 14
Ring-tum Phi regarding The Princeton Review Student
Access Guide to the Best 306 Colleges.

While the Princeton Review survey identiﬁed many
traits of which Washington and Lee can be proud, the fact
that W&L ranked fourth in the nation in the category of
“Gay Students Ostracized/Discriminated Against” is a dis-
grace to this University. Equally disturbing was the compla-
cent response of Dean of Students David Howison that “On
such a traditional campus there is a reluctance to accept
other lifestyles.”

Dean Howison’s characterization of gay or lesbian sexual
orientation as “other lifestyles” suggests that he does not
understand that being gay or lesbian is not a lifestyle choice.
Gay men and lesbians constitute an extremely diverse
segment of society and lead an equally diverse array of
lifestyles. In fact, some gay men and lesbians are Washing-
ton and Lee students. Their lives are no different from those

‘ of other students here except for the fact that they live in an

environment in which they must either conceal an important

part of their lives or risk facing ostracism and abuse. By
saying that it is “other” lifestyles that this “traditional
campus” is reluctant to accept, Dean Howison implies that
being gay or lesbian pertains only to the lives of people
outside this University and has played no part in the institu-
tions that make this campus a traditional one. He is
doubly mistaken.

J eb and Dash:/l Diary of GayLife, 1 918-1 945 is a book
published last year detailing the true story of two gay men
who met as Washington and Lee students in 1918. While it
is probable that these two men and the gay students they
knew at W&Lwere not the first to attend this University, my
point is to illustrate that the presence of gay students here is
at least as old as many traditional aspects of life at W&L. Jeb
Alexander's diary sheds some light on what it was like to be
a gay Washington and Lee student in 1918, but the difficul-
ties faced by gay men and lesbians at W&L are not unique
to that era.

I have personally talked to several gay and lesbian
alumni of which this University can and should be unquali-
fiedly proud. Yet nearly all of them were forced to either

keep their sexual orientation a secret while at W&L or face
ridicule and persecution.

If the presence of gay men and lesbians at Washington
and Lee is nothing new, forcing them to remain “in the
closet” also seems to be a tradition at W&L. It is one of
which we should all be ashamed.

When gay and lesbian students at Washington andLee
are not treated with the same respect and dignity as other
students, the University has a duty to address the problem.

In fact, the undergraduate college of this University has
done relatively little to ensure fair treatment of its gay and
lesbian students. ‘

While the law school has a commendable policy of non-
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in admis-
sions and all other policies and programs, the undergraduate
college has done nothing to stop harassment of gay and
lesbian students and does not include sexual orientation in
its non-discrimination policy statement.

Some would respond by saying that a non-discrimination
policy is unnecessary because they see no evidence of anti-
gay discrimination on the campus, but that response ignores

the fact that hate crimes and harassment of gay men and ;
lesbians often go unreported. They do exist. But why would
gay and lesbians students at W&L seek to bring attention to
the fact that they are harassed?

In this environment, acknowledging the victim’s sexual
orientation is itself dangerous to that victim. Just as the
University has sought to address the problem of date rape,‘
whose victims are also often reluctant to report the crime,
the best way to prevent harassment on the basis of sexual
orientation is through education. Only by educating its
students on sexual orientation issues can this school effec-
tively change the attitudes that make bigotry toward gay!
men and lesbians socially acceptable. For the University to
ignore the issue and wait for students to risk coming forward
to report abuse only continues to send the message to gay
and lesbian students and their would-be harassers-——that
Washington and Lee tolerates such behavior. ,

Cheryl Taurassi

Drew Thomas

Junior setter Cheryl Taurassi has broken most of the
assist records that exist at Washington and Lee. She
broke the school’s match record with 47 in W&L’s
semiﬁnal loss to Bridgewater last weekend.

Last year Taurassi brok the single season mark with
526 assists and set the career record earlier this year, and
after this season, she has 1,437 assists.

Football kicker Drew Thomas came up to the chal-
lenge against Guilford College, nailing the school-record
47-yard ﬁeld goal in the second quarter. He also added a
43-yard ﬁeld goal to give the Generals a six-point lead in
the second half.

Thomas earned the honors for ODAC Offensive Player

So much for scheduling
Washington and Lee on
Guilford’s Homecoming.

The powerful Quakers, with a
record of 7-1 entering the game,
ﬁgured the ﬁfth place Generals
would be no problem, and, as a
result, sceduled W&L for Home-
coming, assuming the large
crowd would be sent home happy.
They did this despite the fact that
the Generals poundedthe Quak-
ers on Homecoming the last time
they visited Greensboro, North
Carolina.

Who says lightning can’t
strike twice in the same place?

The Generals stunned
Guilford and the crowd of 5,300
with a thrilling 13-7 victory,
W&L’s ﬁfth straight triumph in
the state of North Carolina over-
all and second this season.

“It was fantastic,” said junior
defensive tackle Robert Hull. “It
was something we knew we could

be doing.”

“It felt great,” said freshman ~

defensive tackle Omar Moneim.
“It was the best football game
l’ve ever seen.”

Head coach gary Fallon
agreed.

“It was the most exciting game
l’ve seen in my 17 years here,”
he said.

Washington and Dec evened
its record at 4-4 (2-3 in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference)
with its third consecutive win,
and fourth in the last ﬁve games
after three straight losses to open
the season in which the Generals
scored a grand total of two points.

To make the defeat even more
bitter for Guilford, the Quakers
were eliminated from the ODAC
title hunt with the loss, handing
the title to Emory and Henry.

Three times Guilford drove
inside the W&L 20 yard line in
the last four minutes of the game,
only to have the Generals’ de-
fense thwart the penetration each
time.

“I expected it (the defensive

stand),” Hull commented. “The
defense has been playing well
for two years now.”

Fallon congratulated the de-
fense for its effort.

“All eleven guys wanted the
ball to come to them,” he said.

With the Generals clinging to
a 13-7 lead, Guilford drove down
inside the 20 with under four
minutes left, but the Quakers were
halted by Stephen Cox’s fumble
recovery.

Following an interception, the
Quakers plunged all the way
down to the Generals’ three with
less than two minutes to play.
However, quarterback Santes
Beatty was picked off by junior
Rich Achee, which appeared to
seal the game.

The Quakers were not throw-
ing in the towel yet, though. De-
spite being out of timeouts,
Guilford got the ball back and
covered nearly half the ﬁeld in-
side the ﬁnal minute.

The Quakers ‘reached the
W&L 15 before Beatty’s pass
intended for wide receiver Jun-

ior Lord fell incomplete in the
end zone on the game’s ﬁnal
play.

“Guilford hung in there and
kept coming back,” said Fallon.

Kicker Drew Thomas was
named ODAC Offensive Player
of Week, thanks in large part to
his school record 47 yard ﬁeld
goal in the second quarter, which
put the Generals on top 3-0.

Guilford returned fire on
Beatty’s 11 yard touchdown pass
to Dan Montgomery to give the
Quakers a 7-3 advantage late in
the second quarter.

As it has happened so often in
the past few games, the combi-
nation of quarterback Brooks
Fischer and wideout William
Propst clicked again midway
through the third quarter.

Propst, who had another ter-
riﬁc game with ten catches for
133 yards, reeled in a 34 yard
toss from Fischer to propel the
Generals back in front, 10-7.

Fischer, who leads the ODAC
in completion percentage at 52.6
percent had another solid outing

with 17 completions in 30 at-
tempts for a total of 179 yards.

Proving his first ﬁeld goal was
no ﬂuke, Thomas blasted home
a43 yarder early in the fourth
quarter, extending the margin to
13-7 and setting up the ﬁnal fran-
tic minutes.

W&Lsweptthe ODACPlayer
of the Week category, as Hull
was named the Defensive Player
of the Week after dominating the
Quakers for 12 tackles, ﬁve of
them for losses.

Defensive back Stuart Hogue
and linebacker Butler Ball each
added 10 tackles.

Senior Jon Wagner inter-
cepted his fourth pass of the year
to compliment his six tackles.
Wagner also leads the Generals,
who currently are in second place
in the league in scoring and pass-
ing defense, with eight passes
broken up.

W&L opponents are averag-
inga mere 13.75 points per game
this season.

Washington and Lee voyages
up to Swarthmore, Pennsylvania

Football continues to roll; surprises Guilford

this Saturday for their season ﬁ-
nale to wage battle with the 3-6
Swarthmore Garnet.

The only time the Generals
and the garnet have previously
faced each other was back in
1914, when W&L whitewashed
Swarthmore 10-0 in Lynchburg.

That 1 914 W&L football team
went undefeated at 9-0 and
outscored its opposition 324-12,
including the whopping scores
of 103-0, 72-0, and 69-0.

Fallon wants the Generals to
concentrate on this season, how-
ever, and he cautions against a
letdown.

“We need to come back down
to earth,” he said. I “They
(Swarthmore) are a capable team
and have great team speed. It’s
going to be a pretty good game.”

Hull hopes that the Generals’

. momentum will continue into the

final game, as well as into next
season.

“Obviously, we want a win-
ning season,” he said. “Hope-
fully, we can carry it into next
season and a conference title.”

When your team concludes its best
season ever as the fourth best team on the
Eastern -Seaboard, two words best sum
up the feeling.

“We're back.”

The W&L water polo squad made
head coach Page Remillard’s decision to
compete for the Eastern Seaboard Cham-
pionship pay-off with a fourth place ﬁn-
ish. The Generals defeated Queens 15-14
in the opening round, before falling to
Navy and host Brown.‘

The win over Queens clinched W&L’s
best ﬁnish in school history, making the
team’s ﬁrst-ever losing record nearly in-
signiﬁcant.

The Generals (10-13) earned a num-
ber-20 ranking nationally, proving, as

Remillard said, “Washington and Lee‘

water polo is back.”

The Generals were the two-time de-
fending champions of the EWPA Divi-
sion III tournament and would have likely
added a third straight title had they cho-
sen to compete for it this year.

However, W&L’s third place finish at
the EWPA Southeast Regional Playoffs
two weeks ago earned it the right to
compete for the Eastern Seabord title,
with the possibility of going on to the
national championship tournament.

The Generals opened the tournament
tied with Queens at number 19 in the
nation. The squads had met twice on the
opening weekend of the season, with
W&L winning 11-10, then losing 19-7
that same day.

be decided until the very end.

The game was so tight that the scores
for each quarter were even in all but the
second, when W&L took a 9-8 lead to
halftime.

With the game knotted at 14, the Gen-
erals’ Bryan Drum scored the winner on
a counterattack play that Remillard had
put into their scheme that very week.

“That win was a good indicator of our
season,” said Remillard.

Sophomore James Silberstein netted
four goals to lead a balanced Generals
attack.

Juniors Frank Bradenand Drum scored
three each, while junior Rich Cober and
sophomore Peter Sorenson added two
apiece. Senior Ruben Munger rounded
out the scoring.

In goal, senior All-American David
Silvester was as solid as ever in stopping
19 shots.

With 25 more blocks in the losses to
Navy and Brown, Silvester set a school-
record in reaching the 300 save mark for
the season. ‘

“[Silvester] was a major force in our
success,” Remillard said. “Had he not
risen to the occasion, this ﬁnish wouldn’t
have been possible.”

Just as big in the tournament was
Sorenson. The second-team All-East se-
lection scored seven goals in the three
games, including four of the Generals’
ﬁve versus Brown.

The defensive star added four steals in
the Queens game and three against Brown.

“In the big wins [Princeton, Villanova]
be shut their stars down,” said Remillard.

Sorenson was W&L’s leader in scor-

ing, assists, and in what Remillard calls
“hustle points.” These are computed by
subtracting points given for negative plays
from points for positive plays.

Another player who stepped up his
play, especially versus Brown, was se-
nior Derek DeVries. DeVries defended
Brown’s top gun for much of the game.

According to Remillard, he was one
of the few Generals who wasn’t worn out
and really came through in that match.

s“[DeVries] did the job,” he said. “De-
rek owned that guy [he guarded].”

In addition to their fourth-place ﬁn-
ish, there are two things the Generals can
be proud of.

One is that W&L jumped higher in the
rankings than any school. The Generals
were not listed in the top 16 in the East at
the start of the season and wound up
number-four.

Along the way, they defeated ﬁve top-
20 teams, and ﬁve teams that they had
previously lost to.

Queens, Richmond, Princeton,
Bucknell, and Villanova all beat the Gen-
erals before later falling victim to them.

The other is that they achieved their
place in school history through a total
team effort. Rarely does a team succeed
without a solid “go-to” top scorer.

“Generally, teams have go-to people,”
said Remillard. “We knew we didn’t have
one.”

Instead, the team focused on assign-
ments and game plans.

‘‘I can think of no time that anyone
disappointed,” said Remillard.

“We knew what to expect from every-
one and took pride in our ability to play as
a team.”

What had become one of the most popular spectator sports on campus saw its

By ERIC SWENSEN

Phi Staff Writer

For the ﬁrst time in Old Dominion Athletic Conference

history, the conference cross country team titles were swept by
the Washington and Lee men’s and women’s cross country

teams.

The men tallied 49 points, eight points better than runner-up
Eastern Menonite, while winning their ﬁrst title in ten years.

The women set an unbreakable record, sweeping the top ﬁve

positions and compiling only 15 points in winning their third

straight ODAC title.

The men’s team was led on this day by a trio of freshmen who

have supplied steady performances all season. Jason Callen was
a very competitive third overall, a mere ﬁve seconds behind the
overall winner, and Will Olson and Taylor Shultz also ﬁnished

in the top ten.

Tucker is betting on a strong showing for his team.
“There is no pressure on us, and if we have everyone there,
healthy, and running up to potential, we have a shot at
ﬁnishing top three,” said the coach.
Callen also sees this race as important for next year.
“This race will show us how much we have to improve,”
said the freshman. “If we ﬁnish strongly, it will give us a lot
of momentum to carry over into training for next year.”
The women’s team turned in a dominant performance on
Saturday, sweeping the top ﬁve overall places for a record for
team score that can’t be broken — 15 points.

This accomplishment is even more impressive consider-
ing the team competed without two of its top runners — junior
Josephine Schaeffer and freshman Maren Wright.

Without question, the rest of the team picked up the slack,
as junior Amy Mears, the overall champion, led a pack of ﬁve
All-ODAC runners from W&L, including sophomore Nat
Messmore, seniors Sue Deutsch and Kim Herring and fresh-

man Carson Flowers.

Olson and Callen also earned All-ODAC status for their

performances.

Women’s coach Jim Phemister couldn’t have been more

satisﬁed.

Junior co-captains Tom Fink and Jeff Zeiger also turned in

solid performances. Fink and Zeiger finished 14th and 17th

overall.

Coach John Tucker was happy with his team ’s performance,

saying, ‘‘I told the guys that if they ran like they had been, they

would win it.”

Top finisher Callen echoed his coach’s sentiments.

“I was veryproud to be on the team. There was a lot of

pressure on us, most of it self-imposed,” said Callen. “We had

a few guys run with some injuries, and while I don’t think we
ran our best race on Saturday, I was proud of how the guys

pulled through.”

“Obviously I am very pleased,” commented Phemister.
“This our third straight ODAC Championship and by the
widest margin yet and ‘the lowest team score ever, and
forever.”
Mears, while not pleased with her individual performance,
was also somewhat surprised by her team’s performance.

“We were really happy with our performance, considering
who we had missing,” said Mears.
The women will also head to Atlanta this weekend with a
deﬁnite chance of qualifying for the National Champion-
ships. Theirtoughest test will come from host Emory Univer-

sity. -

Next up for the team is the NCAA Division III Southeast

Regional at Emory University in Atlanta.

Only one team from the region qualiﬁes for the NCAA

National Championships, and Christopher Newport is the over-

whelming favorite inthe team competition.

Other top contenders include Mary Washington, Emory, and

Eastern Mennonite.

Both Mears and Phemister like their team’s chances to
qualify, especially with a full squad.

Said Mears, ‘‘I think we have a good chance, a very
realistic hope of qualifying for Nationals.”

Phemister agreed, commenting, “We didn’t run with
Josephine or Maren Wright, but they’ll be ready to run at the

Regionals.

The Generals, however, ranked number two in the region,

volleyball team lost in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference semiﬁnals.
The Generals were beaten by Bridgewater in a breath—taking ﬁve-game -

marathon, 3-2 (11-15, 15-6, 15-9, 9-15, 18-16).

“It was a great season,” said head coach Tern’ Dadio. “We basically accom-
plished everything we had hoped to achieve at the start of the season.”

The Generals (19-8) ﬁnished the regular season tied for second with
Bridgewater, one of only two ODAC opponents to defeat the Generals.

Entering the tournament as the number-three seed and the host school
provided W&L with an excellent opportunity to reach the championship match.
But after whipping Emory and Henry in the opening round, the Generals fell in
a tremendously emotional contest to the Eagles, who had beaten W&L 3-1 in the
ﬁrst week of the season.

Dadio’s second year at the helm was still a landmark season for the Generals.
The school-record 19 win season included win streaks of four, ﬁve, and six.
W&L also posted a nine-match win streak versus ODAC opponents.

Even in the defeat, 1994 continued to be a record-breaking season as junior
Cheryl Taurassi picked up a school single-game record of 47 assists against

Bridgewater. W&L as a team had just 50. She now owns the game, season, and

career W&L assists records, and was named W&L’s Athlete of the Week.

a part of it. After the Generals won two strai

* Superdance
prepares for
 Feburary

ﬁx

By MICHAEL Hawusrr
Phi Staff Writer

Superdance, a year-long fundraiser
for the Muscular Dystrophy Associa-
tion, has already lined up some events
for this year.

1; Co-chairman Tina Hand said the

biggest fundraiser is the concert in Feb-
ruary. Last year David Allen Coe
played. Hand said they are doing re-
search for the band this year.

“A big factor we’re looking at this
year is bands that may be more gener-
ous for charity,” she said.

Hand said they are putting in bids
for bands and asking for lower prices.
Co-chairman Trey Block said they are

1 looking for a big name band. He said if

they cannot get a big name band, they
will look at smaller bands. The concert
is scheduled for February 4, 1995.
Money is raised in two different
ways: selling tickets and asking frater-
nities and sororities for substantial do-
nations. The Student Activities Board
always gives a big donation as well as
other various organizations. She said
fraternity pledges usually raise $100

1‘ each. Tickets will be sold for $10.

Hand said Superdance gets support
from the Lexington community.
“Our food (for the concert) is usu-
ally donated by the community,” she

R said. “That’s less cost to us.

Block said concessions such as hot
dogs, sodas, beer and popcorn will be
sold during the concert. Drinks are

donated by local restaurants.

Organizations or individuals who
raise $ 100 will get into the concert free.
They will get the food donated by the
community, said Block.

Door prizes are given during the
concert and Casino Night. Hand said
those gifts are donated by the business
community. Special gifts are given out
during the concert. Some hotels such
as the Homestead will donate a gift
certiﬁcate for a free weekend as a re-
ward for support. Hand said any orga-
nization can win these prizes, but fra-
ternities tend to receive these prizes.

Casino Night, a traditional
Superdance fund-raiser, is scheduled
for sometime in January. This event
was canceled last year because of bad
weather. Bowling night will occur on
December 1 at Fast Lane Bowling Al-
ley. Hand said they made a special
arrangement with Fast Lane. The bowl-
ing alley will make a package deal, and
Superdance will receive a small per-
centage of the revenue, she said. Hand
said the money goes toward operating
costs and the concert.

Another fund-raiser is “Give Up
Some Meals.” Students, whether on
the full meal plan or the 5-meal plan,
are asked to not eat at Evans Dining

 mHalL».on a’ particular night. Shesaid

almost the entire freshmen class par-
ticipates, who make up 75% of the
people the D-Hall serves. The D-Hall
staff estimates who will not be eating
and gives the extra revenue that would
have been made to Superdance.

other criminal cases, in
' his talk to the W&L law
school on Wednesday.
The fact that Simpson

other criminal cases.

Uelman admitted that

at times clients with more
money can afford better

“Ultimately it does
produce injustice,”
he said.

Throughout the case,
the media have surprised
Uelman with their lack
of integrity.

“When I started this
case, I had a very clear
line in my head dividing
the legitimate press from
tabloid press,” said
Uelman.

“That line has j ust dis-

Already, acquaintan-

views and best-sell-

to the passing of a
law that, as of Janu-
ary 1, 1995, will
make it illegal in the
state of California for
prospective wit-
nesses to accept pay-
ment for the publica-
tion of their stories
before trial.

This is a preven-
tive measure for fu-
ture cases and will
have no effect on the
Simpson trial.

The zealousness
of the media has also
raised the question of
whether cameras should
be allowed in the court-
room. Ultimately Judge
Ito permitted cameras
duringthe trial, for which
Uelman is grateful.

“The camera in the
courtroom is really our
savior,” he said.

Cameras counteract
the chaos outside of the
courtroom, and allow
“one eye on the process
that isn’t ﬁltered.”

Phonathon brings in $38,182

Calling allows students to interact with alumni

By MICHAEL Hi=.w1.r-:'rr
Phi Staff Writer

When juniorShelley Milligan called
a Washington and Lee alumnus for a
contribution last Spring, she heard him
say, “hold on a second . . . Cheerios.”

Milligan assumed the man was talk-
ing to his wife. Later, Milligan found
out that the alumnus was talking on a
cellular phone.

“I got this huge pledge while he was
picking up his Cheerios at Kroger,”
Milligan said.

“ [That] someone cares enough about
Washington & Lee...to spend money
on it while he’s buying groceries is
kind of cool.”

Four nights this past week, Milligan
and 79 other students called W&L
alumni for contributions to the
Annual Fund.

The students raised about $38,182
to help keep tuition down, said Maureen
Levey, a W&L graduate who coordi-
nates student phonathons.

“That’s a great success,” Levey said.

“This is how we pay the bills.”

The volunteer callers helped the
university update alumni records, in-
crease alumni participation, and raise
money for the Annual Fund.

“We depend very much on our stu-
dent volunteers to reach the alums,”

said Peter Cronin, associate director
of development and Annual
Fund director.

“They can convey a sense of what’s
going on, what’s really happening.”

The Annual Fund pays for about
seven percent of the University’s oper-
ating expenses, Cronin said. More
than half of the Annual Fund pays for
academic programs. The rest of the
money supports expenses such as li-
brary resources, light bulbs, computer
software, and faculty salaries,
Levey said.

Last year’s phonathons raised $162,
616, Cronin said. That represents six
percent of the $2.6 million raised for
the Annual Fund last year, Cronin said.
He said that $4,500 is budgeted to run
the student phonathons. Cronin, who
called alumni as an undergraduate, said
the students reach the most recent
alumni who generally give the
most money.

Inside the former Military Science
building last Wednesday night, eleven
W&L students ju ggled telephone head-
sets, pledge tally sheets, and alumni
information forms.

The students volunteered for hour
and a half shifts calling alumni who
had already received mailings about
the Annual Fund, Levey said.

In between free snacks and drinks,
the students connected with alumni.

Mock Con picks up
13 new members

 

“You don’t feel like you’re impos-
ing on people,” freshman Eric
Reuther said.

“They all are real interested in you
and W&L. Half the time you have to
try and get them off the phone.”

“Generally, I’d say W&L alumni
are very generous and considerate,”
Levey said.

“They want to know how their old
professors are doing [and] what’s go-
ing on with their fratemity house.”

“If you like to talk to people, you’re
gonna have a good time because that’s
all this is,” Milligan said.

Many students said they felt they
were giving something back to W&L
by volunteering their time.

“I think it’s a great way for us to
support the school,” said junior
Laura Howell.

The three-year—old Student Devel-
opment Committee, composed of 32
students, runs the phonathons. Chair-
man Mark Crider offered one motiva-
tion for calling alumni.

“By keeping the price down, you’re
giving future students the chance to go
to Zollman’s and have the same oppor-
tunities as you,” Crider said.

At the beginning of each session,
Levey trained volunteers and answered
questions. Each student received a train-
ing manual which explained how
to handle potential objections

from alumni.

Kristin Lawrence, a vice chairman
of the Student Development Commit-
tee, said some alumni objected
to coeducation. Crider explained
other exceptions.

“There’s your basic death and con-
dolences and sexual interruptions,”
he said.

One woman, Crider said, asked him
if he was “the pizza man,” a reference
to her husband.

Sophomore Deborah Zollmann said
she got a pledge from someone who
didn’t even graduate from W&L.

“He transferred to Columbia and
hated it so he’s giving us money,”
she said.

The alumni information forms in-
clude nicknames like Big Luker,
Straight Fairy, and Chewie.

‘‘I try not talk with someone named
‘Chewie’ too long,” Zollmann said.

Kendall Cruickshanks ’98, Annie
Plummer ’97, and Amy Gorham ’97
received the most pledges, Levey said.
They received a prize, and all 80 volun-
teers received free t-shirts and a free
long-distance call.

Students interested in calling alumni
in January and February can call
Maureen Levey at 463-8487.

Clinton pushes free trade in Indonesia

In Jakarta, Indonesia this week, President Clinton attended a summit
of Asian and Paciﬁc nations. On Tuesday, 18 members of the Asian
Paciﬁc Economic Cooperation forum were scheduled to pledge to estab-
lish free trade in the region by 2020. It is Clinton’s hope that the free trade
proposal will boost human rights in the region by encouraging economic
growth and the establishment of a democracy oriented middle class.

Yeltsin prepares for tougher US Congress

On Monday, Russian president Boris Yeltsin met with his top military

Cynics have won accordin

By CINDY YOUNG
Phi Staff Writer

The cynics have won.

So, at least, was the conclusion at
which Politics Professor Mark Rush
arrived in his speech last
Thursday evening.

Rush’s speech was the second in a
new series of talks called the Last Lec-
ture Series.

The series is being developed by
Catholic Campus Minister Burr Datz,
in an attempt to break what he calls a
“kind of barrier [that stands] between
the faculty and the students and keeps

. them from having a comfortable rela-

tionship with one another.”

‘ The theme of the entire series, and
the question posed to each featured
speaker, is the query, “If you could
give one final lecture, what would
it be?”

In addition to a new lecture each
week, the series includes a casual din-
ner for speaker and audience in the
GHQ preceeding each speech, and,
later, a follow-up question and answer
session, coffee and dessert.

The first lecturer was Law Profes-
sor and Women’s Track Coach James
Phemister, who spoke Thursday, Oc-
tober 27.

“Although attendance was sparse,
the quality of the lecture was outstand-
ing,” said Datz.

A similar description could be ap-
plied to last night’s lecture, delivered
by Rush; the audience was small and
the topic a challenge.

Speaking to an informal group of
interested students and colleagues from
behind a makeshift podium, Rush de-

Members of
MC steering
committee
decided on

livered a lecture in which he attempted
to address the “ongoing battle between
the cynics and the idealists” he had
observed both in his courses and in his
graduate work.

Cynics, Rush observed, always seem
to “get the better half of the argument”
concerning whether law, morality and
justice can actually be defined.

With the backing of logic, cynics
convincingly contend that law,
morality and justice are
“meaningless notions.”

To the cynic, any of the three is
simply a matter of preference — some-
times on the part of the individual,
sometimes on the part of society.

Justice, then, as well as law and '

morality, is every bit as subjective as
the preference one ﬂavor over another.

This argument can provoke much
discomfort between idealists and cyn-
ics, as Rush himself attested; a discus-
sion of these very ideas led to a “seri-
ous difference of opinion” between
Rush and his wife.

Instead of searching for a complete
resolution to the differences of opinion
often held by idealists and cynics, Rush
concluded his speech by suggesting
that perhaps the entire question is, in
fact, “moot”.

Rush left his audience with the ad-
vice not to spend too much time worry-
ing about the issue.

“What some folks call morality, oth-
ers won’t”, said Rush.

And even through this unresolved
argument, Rush pointed out, “society
tends to stumble along.”

Rush thus upheld the high standard
of the Last Lecture Series established
by Phemister.

Datz, the series coordinator, plans

g to Rush , 

Rush

eventually to feature a new speaker son, who has agreed to deliver his re’ ‘

each month.

Lecturers to be featured in upcom-
ing sessions include Professor John
Gunn, a recent retiree of the Economy
Department, who will speak early next
term, and W&L President John Wil-

ﬂections in April or May.
Signs about future lectures will be
posted across campus, and all those

interested are invited to attend an

evening which reveals the more rare,
personal side of a professor.

dent, Todd Rehm, will be the Security Chairman. He
will be responsible for coordinating all security ef-
forts at Mock Con functions. He will work with
Washington and Lee Security , local and state police
and with personal security guards in maintaining
order at convention events.

Facilities Chairman will be junior Ted Saunders.
He will be responsible for the convention hall design
and construction, transportation, telephones, and
computer support.

Freshman Jason Callen and sophomore Margie
Ford will serve as the Journal Editors. They will be
responsible for all aspects of the Joumal’s produc-
tion. Additionally, they are charge of producing
several issues of the Mock Con Report. The Journal
is the ofﬁcial program and record of the Mock Con,
while the Report is a monthly/bimonthly newsletter
and report of progress toward the Mock Con.

Sophomore Maggie Ogilvie will be the Memora-
bilia Chairman. She will be responsible for produc-
ing and obtaining Mock Con memorabilia, and for
marketing such at the Mock Con.

The Platform Chairman will be junior Andy
Olmem. He is responsible for all aspects concerned
with the production of the Mock Convention Plat-
form. He conducts research and writes the proposed
platform which is debated upon during the Conven-
tion. The platform is the only element of the Mock
Con which reﬂects student opinion.

The next round of Mock Convention selections
will take place in Feburary of 1995. The ﬁfty-four
state charimen will be chosen at that time.

have to live with the results of the trial.

The level of public acceptance of the results of his
trial will be enhanced if people can see.”

The process of jury selection for the Simpson trial I
also distinguishes it from ordinary criminal cases.

Pools of hundreds of prospective jurors finally
dwindled down to the selected jurors and alternates
after extensive interviewing.

“Judge Ito allowed the most comprehensive ques-‘,,
tionnaire ever used in a criminal case,” said Uelman.

A change of venue was not requested for the case,
as the defense team wanted to avoid the public
outrage of the Rodney King trial, which was moved
from downtown Los Angeles to Simi Valley,
said Uelman. 3

As in the beating case, race will play a role in the
Simpson trial.

“I don’t see how you can keep race out of a case
when you have a black defendant accused of murder-
ing a white victim, even though she was his former,
wife,” said Uelman.

New computer technologies are aiding both sides
of the case.

“We’re using the most sophisticated court report-
ing system available,” said Uelman. “The transcript
is instantly produced.” J?’

The graphics system used for producing visual
aids has also improved.

“You will see spectacular computer graphics dur-
ing this trial,” said Uelman.

“They’ll knock your socks off.” ‘

With Thanksgiving injust a few
days, the time comes to look ahead and
start thinking about — no, not exams
— Christmas shopping! But do not
waste those precious hours at home
reserved for hanging out with friends
trying to brave a crowded mall packed
with day-after-Thanksgiving-
sale shoppers.

The shops right here in Lexington

 

have so many cute gifts to take back
home with you, so get out and explor ~
downtown while you still have time.
Here’s a short list of ideas to help get
you started.

Try the Cocoa Mill (on Nelson
Street) for wonderful chocolates that
will be great for everyone on your list.
They also have coffees and other gift
items, but jus tht esmell of chocolate
inside makes it a worthwhile stopping
point on a mad shopping tour of Lex-
ington. Spanky’ also makes gift bas-
kets to sed to loved ones far away, and
other shops do as well.

Caravan’s is near the Cocoa Mill,
and they have wonderful, unique Christ-
mas ornaments no one should miss, as
well as clothes, jewelry, and gift items.
Sunday’s Child and Fantasies are also
fun gift shops on Main Street and
Nelson Street, respectively. Sunday’s
Child has candles and holders,

Lexington shops
abound with gifts

__ choices too, such as Pappagallo, La-

wonderful toys and clothes for
children, and just about everything
made with angels and fairies. Fantasies
has great picture frames, garden ac-
cents, so many unique decorations like
wicker alligators and fountains made
from translucent stone — worth the
trip just to see them.

For mothers or grandparents, the
gift shops downtown are a great source
of cute prsents; try the shops along
Main Street. Artists in Cahoots, the
Shenandoah Attic, and Virginia Born
and Bred are great choices for gifts
with local color. Those who would
rather give clothing have some fun

dies Habit, and the College
Town Shop.

For fathers, they can always use
another tie, so visit Alvin-Dennis and
the College Town Shop (good choices
for brothers as well), or creative and hit
one of the many gift shops. Another
choice for brothers is the Night Owl,
which offers a great selection of 'CDs,
or the Bookstore, which offers a great
send-the-bill-home option. And re-
member the Bookstore as the best place
in town to outﬁt an entire family in
gray W&L sweatshirts or to ﬁnd a
collar for a Christmas puppy.

Even those who must travel light as
they head home for the holidays do not
need to suffer shopping the malls; many
Lexington shops will ship presents
home, but shop soon so they can arrive
when you do.

Dyson gives another View of Malcolm X

By MICHAEL HEWLETI‘
Phi Staff Writer

I read The Autobiography of Malcolm X during my
senior year in high school. Before that time, Malcolm was
a mystery to me. I only knew him as the opposite of Martin
Luther King, Jr. He was a racist, a hate monger. While King
had a dream, Malcolm had a nightmare. In recent years, a
new interest in Malcolm X has emerged. In popular culture,
wearing a X cap or T-shirt has become fashionable. His
militancy is emulated by rap groups such as Public Enemy.
In 1992, always controversial director Spike Lee came out
with a much anticipated ﬁlm interpretation of his life.
Malcolm has almost become a cult historical ﬁgure, some-
times overshadowing King. But Michael Eric Dyson, author
of Making Malcolm.‘ The Myth and Meaning of Malcolm X,
asserts that Malcolm’s popularity has come at the price of
not critically examining the evolution of his thought, his life
and his meaning for America today.

Dyson argues that Malcolm X has frequently been mis-
understood. Critics have unfairly labeled him simply as a
racist demagogue who denounced white men as devils. He
contends that these critics do not evaluate Malcolm in an
evolutionary and historical context. Malcolm constantly
questioned and revised his ideas while staying aligned to the
notion of black nationalism. He also developed a more
international scope. He began to see civil rights as human
rights issue and compared the oppression of black Ameri-
cans with other oppressed peoples around the world, espe-
cially in Africa.

Yet, Dyson contends that today ’s youth and rappers have
embraced Malcolm without really understanding him. They
have failed to criticize his shortcomings.

As Ossie Davis said in his famous eulogy, Malcolm X
was black manhood. Rappers such as Tupac Shakur and Ice
Cube have found their masculinity in Malcolm. Unfortu-
nately, these rappers have distorted their masculinity in
cultivating a tough image and denouncing women, espe-
cially black women. They see Malcolm as a saint, someone

who has no failings or shortcomings. But this is hardly true.
“Malcolm’sbrand of black nationalism was not only a ﬁerce
attack on white Americans, but a sharp rebuke to black
women as well. Malcolm went to extremes in demonizing
women, saying that the ‘closest thing to a woman is a
devil.”’ Today, some rappers prefer “bitch” or “ho” to devil,
but it still translates to one thing: a frightening lack of
respect for women. Although Malcolm amended his beliefs
about gender issues, these rappers have not made that leap.

Dyson also turns his attentions to the new wave of black
ﬁlmmakers such as John Singleton and Matty Rich. Films
such as Boys in the Hood and Menace [1 Society employ
some of Malcolm’s criticisms of society. Like rappers, these
black male ﬁlmakers use masculinity as a major theme in
their ﬁlms. Boys in the Hood constantly reiterates the
message that black men must raise their sons. What about
black women? In many of these ﬁlms, black women are
often relegated to the background, Dyson argues.

Dyson also takes a hard look at Spike Lee’s ﬁlm rendi-
tion of Malcolm’s life. Lee took heat even before he began

making the movie by asserting that only a black could
adequately direct the movie. Amiri Baraka, poet and former
leader of the Black Arts Movement in the l960’s, criticized
Lee, arguing that Lee’s other ﬁlms revealed his inability to
make a honest portrayal of Malcolm.

In the end, Dyson does a good job of analyzing Malcolm ’s
meaning in American life. To most people, Malcolm repre-
sented black rage. He spoke honestly about things blacks
rarely raised in the public forum. '

Dyson provides a much needed critical reading of
Malcolm’s thought and evolution. All too often, Malcolm is
either rendered as a hero or a racist. He was both. Complex-
ity describes Malcolm; he refused to be labeled. Dyson
suggests that Malcolm has some answers for some of
society’s most pressing problems, but he must ﬁrst be
understood. Dyson provides for his readers a fundamental
foundation to start.

Ellie ‘iﬂing-tum lﬁlti

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

Giving Thanks to the Alma Mater

Let us pray.

As we prepare to leave town for the holiday, we give
thanks for all those things we have and all those poor
stiffs who do not go to Washington and Lee University,
don’t.

-Nine days for Thanksgiving-—We know of no other
school that gives an entire week, plus two weekends, as
Thanksgiving break. While we are worrying about which
television channel to watch when we get up at 1 p.m.
Monday, all of our non-W&L friends will be taking
exams. You’ve gotta love it.

°The Cadaver Society—It makes college existence so
unabashedly romantic to think that we might run across
the black-clad members of an organization named after
something dead while we are out studying at 3 a.m. They
might be meeting right now underneath our feet...Oooo!
It makes us feel so safe to know our campus is being
watched over while we are sleeping.

°Poetry Readings——THAT’S ENTERTAINMENT!

The Princeton Review—What could be so incredibly
cool as knowing that you go to the school that has the
most encroaching fraternity and sorority scene in the
country and the number three school for hard liquor. Let
us drink this holiday to number one in ’95.

Someone sent a huge and tasteful bouquet of ﬂowers
to “The women of The Ring-tum Phi” and we are
overwhelmingly grateful. Let us give thanks to men who
listen to women’s complaints. Only at Washington and
Lee.

-We are probably the only school in the nation which
has a statue of one of its namesakes lying, dead, in state
in a prominent viewing location. It’s a tourist trap, even.
Think of all the elderly people who will call their
grandchildren at their much more mundane colleges and
say, “Guess what, Dear. I just saw a stone dead man,” and
they will be talking about our former President.

°We have the oldest journalism school in the country.
It goes great with some of the oldest professors in the
country. Where else can you learn all about hot lead from
the people who used it in high school?

°Where else can one move up so quickly in the ranks
of the hallowed halls? Underclassmen have been known
to be presidents of their fraternities, high-ranking editors
of campus newspapers, etc.

Quote of the Week:

“A Quayle—Powell ticket would be unstoppable!”

Defeats will strengthen Democrats in ’96

 

I don’t know how many times last
Wednesday I was asked why I wasn’t
dressed in black. I guess the common
assumption was that I should be
mourning the loss of Democratic
control of Congress. Admittedly, last
Tuesday was not one of the happiest
days of my life; however, there were
some victories. For example, Robb won
in Virginia and even carried
Lexington; and in my home state of
Florida, Lawton Chiles won and
gambling was defeated, proving money
can’t buy everything. Besides, people
wear black to funerals, the end of a life
- and the Democratic party is far from
dead -just momentarily stunned.

As a side note, last Tuesday’s
electionseemstoprovideanotherboost
to the argument against term limits.
The people spoke and a lot of
Democrats lost their seats, including

- some who have been around since

before I was born. Evidently, people
are not enthralled by incumbeney. Now
all we have to do is get them to turn
their attention to the Republican side
of Congress.

As for the main point in this
column, I do not think that the
Republican victory is the end of the
Democrats. First of all, the
Republicans have todosomethingwith
their victory, like fulfill the terms of the
Contractwith America. Second, I think

the Democratic party has been too
complacent. After all it’s been forty
years that we’ve controlled the House,
and the election of a Democratic
president made us too cocky. A while
in the minority may help us consolidate
as a party, teach us a little offensive
play, and even benefit us in ’96.

So why will the Republicans have a
hard time accomplishing anything? It’s
beenpforty years since they’ve had
control of the House. In that time
they’ve fine tuned their ability to
oppose legislation, but they may have
forgotten; how to govern. To
accomplish anything they are going to
have to learn how to compromise,
within the party as well as with
Democrats. Already, there are signs
that this may be a problem. Both Newt
Gingrich and Phil Gramm have taken a
hard-line stanceby saying no
compromise. Bob Dole has appeared
as the moderate peacemaker who wants
to work with the administration and the
Democrats to get something done. A
clash in personalities between the
leadership of the two branches of
Congress is something to watch
out for.

Then there is the question of the
Republican presidential nomination for
’96. Gramm just filed with the FEC;
Dole is thinking about it; and there are
numerous other Republicans who are
considering running for president.
When I was in DC last weekend, there
were numerous buttons for people in
’96, from Cheney to Alexander to
Limbaugh, although I think that’s
pushing it a bit. These potential
nominees all want to appear in the best
light in ’96, which may involve
denouncing the ideas of a

potential rival.

I think this election is good for the
Democrats, in that now the party is
going to have to releam offensive skills.
We are so used to having to defend our
ideas from the Republicans and trying
to make everything acceptable to the
other side that we have forgotten how
to take the hard line. This is true for
both Congress and the President. Not
that the Democrats should ignore
anything a Republican puts forth, but

but instead mobilized their traditional
voting base. The Democrats are going
to have to figure out who they need to
win and whether there is a possibility
of bringing them into the fold without
alienating other groups. As a member
of the left wing, I am not particularly
happy with this idea but realize it will
be necessary.

This brings me to the presidential
election of ’96. There have been
suggestions that there will be people

This is also a chance for the
Democrats to re-evaluate their voter
base. There was no set rule for who
won on Tuesday, but moving to the
right did not seem to help some
Democratic Congressmen who lost.
Some of those who, including Robb,
Kennedy, and Chiles did not try to
change people’s perception of them

nothing had been accomplished, then
the Republicans could point to this as
an example of how even one party
government is not a guarantee of
action. In ’96 they will have to defend
their record.

Needless to say, I’m looking
forward to ’96 for another change in
House control.

ever form it may take.

Order and rationality key to civilization

NICHOLAS L.
WADDY, ’96

 

This article is Part One in a series on the many
virtues of Western Civilization.

A certain person once had the audacity to ask
me, after I had made the characteristic statement
that Western Civilization is under threat and is in
need of more effective defense, just what exactly is
‘civilization’? I was naturally tempted to render the
same reply I always do in such situations:
"Civilization is what I say civilization is, so shut
up!” This type of response can get you far in the
world, as I have learned, but even more effective is
an at least superﬁcially appealing argument. It
is this that I shall now seek to supply. I propose that
civilization, understood to be necessarily ‘good’,
involves three essential components.

The first of these is a desire and appreciation for
learning. By this I mean many things — not only a
desire for scientific and practical knowledge, but
also for wisdom in such murky arenas as
philosophy, theology, politics, literature, history,
and many others. Of course all people cannot be
fully acquainted with all disciplines of knowledge,
nor is it necessarily the case that all should even
desire such an unrealistically broad education —
intellectual frustration, after all, is the parent of
apathy; nevertheless, there is such a thing as
intellectual curiosity, and it is the mark of an
advanced civilization that at least a considerable
minority of its members should have it."

Learning, we should point out, necessarily
producesmovementandchange. Culturesdoevolve,
much to the chagrin of reactionaries like myself,
and to some extent this is not only inevitable, but
virtuous. What this change should involve, and in

what direction it can be expected to take a civilized
society, is a question too complicated for this essay
to address. For readers still hungry for
enlightenment on this important subject of change,
Ican only underscore once again the importance
of reading my column on a regular basis.

The second element of civilization, it seems to
me, involves the question of charity. It seems safe
enough to say that a certain amount of forgiveness to
one’s fellow man is good, though how much is
always an irksome matter. This issue is hazy and of
little interest to me personally, since I am usually
inclined to think that there -
is all too much charity
ﬂoating about in the world
anyway, but even a can-
tankerous misanthrope such
as I would have to admit
that a little kindness is not

‘(C

Learning, we

arbitrariness is always contrary to civilized life
(crime is an arbitrary factor in every society,
for example). This fact further necessitates that
whatever change does occur in a society should al-
ways be slow, since radical shifts upset the delicate
balance of psychologies that keeps a society reasoned
and restrained. The French Revolution is the stock
example of a society gone mad -— a society that sheds,
albeit even temporarily, all real pretense to
civilization. Thus we say that order is a prerequisite
forcivilized life. In acurious way, then, conservatism,
as it favors only deliberate and ordered change, is
itself a component of
civilized (which is to say,
‘good’) living. Fancy that!

This is only a
thought-game on my part,
really, but, as is usually
the case, I have come a

The third element of
civilization (and the one I
most enjoy discussing) is
order and rationality. In
some respects this aspect of
civilization may mitigate
against the charity I
mentioned before, but I
leave this to the
imagination of the reader.
Suffice it to say that a
society that is in constant turmoil, wherein the rules
of the game, so to speak, are oonstan tly changing, is
uncivilized.

Human beings can only meet obstacles in an
effective manner when they are placed into some

the problem of values.
There is still no objective
basis on which to resolve
many of the moral issues
of our time. Still, a
concept of civilized life can
be helpful in solving some
of them, and it should, at
the very least, put one more nail in the coffin of
relativistic thought. My own opinion on the subject of
how Western Civilization fares by the criteria I have
proposed, both in itself and in comparison to other
civilizations, will appear in two weeks. No doubt the
suspense is difficult to bear...

I like President Clinton. I just can’t help it.

‘Clinton needs new leadership philosophy

The time has come, when Jesse Helms rattles his old, withered saber, to stand
up and say (quietly and bitterly in private session with Bob Dole), “If you don’t
shut that shriveled old narrow-minded cracker up in the next week, I’ll become

a Republican!”

to cut the National Service program!

tried to pretend it wouldn’t matter, but I think it’s time
to face facts. He’s going to have a tough time working
in the new political environment.

It But (and I think you saw this coming), I have some

little advice that I think Bill can use to get himselfout
of his present near-hopeless situation: Be President.

It’s simple, sure, but it is something Bill has not
quite been able to learn yet, nearly two years into his

‘( presidency.

As President, you have to make some tough choices,
you have to take some tough stands. But how, you
ask, does this apply to Bill Clinton, locked out of the
Congress, regarded by many as a lame duck and
nearly stripped of all duties except the veto, which he

1 has yet to use?

That’s easy. Mr. Clinton, break free of all your
preconceived notions about being President! I know
you’ve read a lot of books, but all of that knowledge
is useless now. No one in history has been in your

‘ position and survived (don’t say Truman either, he

' had character). So chuck it all, forget it. The time has
come to be President, be yourself.

The time has come for throwing public barbecues

on the White House lawn, with blow-up Gingrich

punching bags for the kids and Willie Nelson

that you are!

So, while I like the election results and think_they bode well (almost) any way
they play out, I think ol’ Bill is in real trouble.VOh, I know, I_"ve tried to deny it, :.

appointNewt Gingricjhlagriculture secretary_ _in a White

House ceremony and swear "he said he’d accept,
denouncing him as a liar and a cheat when he

The time has come to call up William Rehnquist
late at night and say in your best Nixon-back-from-
the-grave voice, “I appointed you to the Supreme
Court—and I think it’s time for you to go, my
friend,” so you can make Hillary chiefjustice!

Throw caution to the wind! You have nothing
to lose!

Call a special congressional session to approve a
mission to Mars!

Submit Haiti for consideration as the ﬁfty-first
state, and Cuba as the ﬁfty-second!

Paint Air Force One in camouﬂage and rename it
“Bill’s Angel,” with a suggestive picture of Hillary
on the side in a cute red mini-skirt!

Do it! Do it now! Mr. President, you have a
chance to make a mark on history!

Wow. ..was that ever cathartic. I guess the point of
that somewhat ridiculous tirade (not that Bill
shouldn’t seriously consider some of it) was that it
really doesn’t seem to matter what the President
does, most of America just doesn’t seem to like him.
The deficit is coming down, unemployment is down,

President Clinton

Hillary and I are deeply saddened
by the news of the death of Pedro
Zamora. ,___._v,,_ M",
enlightened our nation. He taught all of
us the AIDS is a disease with a human
face and one that affects every
American, indeed every citizen of the

world. And he taught people living
with AIDS how to fight for their rights
and live with dignity.

Pedro was particularly instrumental
in reaching out to his own generation,
where AIDS is striking hard. Through
his work with MTV, he taught young
people that “The Real World” includes
AIDS and that each of us has the
responsibility to protect ourselves and

our loved ones.
Today, one in four new HIV

infections is among people under the _.
age of 20. For Pedro,and for all ‘
Americans infected by HIV, we must .,

intensify our efforts to reduce the rate

of HIV infection, provide treatment to '5

those living with AIDS, and, ultimately,
find a cure for AIDS.

Our hearts are with Pedro’s family ..~

in this difficult time. In the months

ahead, let us rededicate ourselves to '5

continuing Pedro’s brave ﬁght.

Sincerely,

Bill Clinton, President of the United

States

Who would have believed it?

Washington and Lee pulled out a 14-11 nailbiter
over the Swarthmore Garnet last Saturday before
1,025 fans at Swarthmore’s Clothier Field. The
victory enabled the Generals to finish with a win-
ning record at 5-4, capping an amazing turnaround
from a miserable 0-3 start to the 1994 season.
Despite the strong stretch run, W&L still closed
out in ﬁfth place in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference with a conference log of 2-3.

The win was the Generals’ fourth straight, and
ﬁfth out of their last six games. They also captured
their fourth victory on the road this season.

Swarthmore sank to 3-7 with the defeat.

The General’s defense led the way by continu-
ally coming up with big plays throughout the
contest, the last one coming on senior defensive
end Stephen Cox’s second fumble recovery of the
game W&L 5 with under three minutes remaining.
Six times the Garnet were held scoreless after
driving inside the W&L 30, mainly due to tum-
overs.

Ironically, turnovers were W&L’s thorn in its
side earlier in the season.

“We took our lumps in earlier games from (the
turnovers), “head coach Gary Fallon mentioned.
“You can’t win close games with turnovers.”

After a scoreless ﬁrst quarter, the Generals
drew first blood on sophomore quarterback Brooks
Fischer’s one yard touchdown sneak, giving W&L
a 7-0 advantage. Fischer passed for 72 of his 89
total yards during the 89 yard scoring drive. Junior
running back Matt Mogk caught a 16 yard pass and
ran for 17 yards on consecutive plays to facilitate
the drive.

Swarthmore responded on a 4 yard TD dash by
Dave Reeser, but the Generals blocked the extra
point attempt to maintain a slight 7-6 margin for
W&L halftime.

That 7-6 lead help up into early in the fourth
quarter, when Seth McKinley took command. The
freshman running back broke clear on a 38 yard
touchdown jaunt to extend the General ’s margin to
14-6. McKinley shattered the 100 yard barrier for
the fourth time this year by racking up 114 yards on

28 rushes. His 667 yards this year were good
enough for fourth place in the ODAC, as well as
being the most rushing yards ever gained by a
W&L freshman.

Swarthmore’s Matt Minero whittled the W&L
margin down to 14-9 with a 38 yard field goal, but
the Garnet then proceeded to shoot themselves in
the foot on the potential game-winning drive on
Cox’s fumble recovery.

W&L sophomore punter Jonathan Gardner ran
out of the end zone with 25 seconds remaining for
a safety, narrowing the lead to 14-11, but giving
the Generals more room to kick. Junior defensive
back Stuart Houge intercepted a Swarthmore des-
peration pass as time ran down to ice the win.

“I’m tickled to death for the kids,” Fallon re-
sponded. “It wasn’t an easy game, but I was
pleased (with the outcome).”

Junior defensive tackle John Tweardy went on
rampage by collecting 17 tackles and one sack
against the Garnet. For his outstanding perfor-
mance, he became the third General this year to
earn ODAC Defensive Player of the Week honors.

Senior noseguard Jason Chartrand closed out
his W&L career with an impressive 14 tackles to
end up with a total of 257 career stops.

Sophomore defensive tackle Peyton Williams
halted the Garnet three times with tackles in short
yardage situations.

The Generals defense ﬁnished ﬁrst in the con-
ference in both pass defense and scoring defense,
only allowing a meager 13.4 points per game.

The Generals defense ﬁnished the ﬁrst in the
conference in both pass defense and scoring de-
fense, only allowing a meager 13.4 points per
game.

William Propst continued his stronghold on the
ODAC receiving title. The senior wide receiver
garnered his third crown following a 61 yard effort
on five catches, boosting his season tally to 56
receptions for 641 yards and ﬁve touchdowns.
Propst wound up in third place in W&L history
with his 141 career grabs.

Sophomore quarterback Tommy Rueger re-
lieved Fischer in the third quarter, and completed
3 of 4 passes for 28 yards for the remainder of the
afternoon.

For the most part, Fallon was satisﬁed with the
squad’s performance this season.

success

“I would have liked for the earlier games to be
replayed,” he stated.

“Seth and Brooks really developed, and the
receivers and the offensive line were improved.”

Fallon, who is currently 25-14 in November

fast ﬁnish to studying for ﬁnals

For the second straight year,
the women’s cross country team
will ﬁnish its season with a sec-
ond place finish in the region,
behind Emory University.

Also for the second year in a
row, the Generals will have two
representatives at the national
championships. Juniors Amy
Mears and Josephine Schaeffer
qualiﬁed once again after second
and fourth place respective fin-
ishes at the regionals.

Mears ran a career-best 18 :06,
four seconds behind winner
Christine Gallagher, a junior at
Emory. Schaeffer, the two-time
regional champion, came in at
18:15 in her first race in a month.

Mears and Schaeffer were both
named ﬁrst-team All-Region for
their performances, while a pair
of freshmen Generals, Carson
Flowers and Maren Wright, also
qualiﬁed for the All-Region team
with top 15 ﬁnishes.

out a strong effort, but we just
didn’t have it that day.”

Flowers saved her best race of
the year for last as she ran a per-
sonal record 19:17. Wright
crossed in a virtual tie with an
Emory runner at 19:27, but was
given the nod by the ﬁnish line
judges for the 15th position.

In their ﬁnal career races, se-
nior co-captains Kim Herring
(19:40) and Sue Deutsch (19:55)
placed 20th and 25th, respec-
tively. Four spots behind co-cap-
tain Deutsch was sophomore Nat
Messmore (19:58).

The star of the meet for the
Generals was clearly Mears.
“Rock”, as she is known to her
teammates, broke her personal
best time by 16 seconds.”It was
probably the best race of my col-
lege career,” she said.

Mears qualiﬁed for nationals
last year after a fourth place ﬁn-
ish in the region with a then-
career best 18:41.

“It is impossible to say too
much about her,” said Phemister.

margin. Centre College was third
with 84 points.The margin of de-
feat for W&L was narrower than
last year, but that may not be
consolation for a team that hoped
to win it.

”[The team] recognizes that
we improved over last year,” said
head coach Jim Phemister, “but
there is no denying that the team
is not indifferent to the fact that
we weren’t ﬁrst. They worked
hard for it.”

On the bright side for the Gen-
erals, all seven runners ran under
20 minutes and placed in the top
30 of the 104 competitors.

”We still had a good season,”
said Mears. “A lot of people put

her best time each season since

. her freshman campaign. Her suc-

cess has come as no surprise to
Schaeffer.

“She’s the hardest worker,”
Schaeffer said. “Amy’s an inspi-
ration to the whole team. She
really deserves everything that
has happened to her.”

What about that nickname?
Schaeffer says it comes from
Mears’ dependibility. ”She al-
ways comes through for the
team.”

As for Schaeffer, the two-time
All-American has overcome an
injury-plagued year to earn her
third trip to nationals.

Last Saturday’s race was just

the fourth loss of her career,
two of those coming at the na-
tional championships. The other
defeat was the 1991 ODAC
Championshipwhen she ranoff-
course and could not muster a
German Silva-type recovery.

At Emory, Schaeffer’s solid
time showed she has recovered
well from the injury.

However, the long layoff was
certainly a factor in losing her
regional title.

“[The race] was hard early
on,” she said. “I didn’t really
know what to expect, but once I
got into it I was able to maintain
a steady pace.”

Schaefferwas suffering from
a stress fracture in the pelvis, an
injury that is fairly common
among female runners.

The injury ought to be com-
pletely healed in three more
weeks, and there is little chance
of it worsening.

Phemister said Schaeffer to-
taled about two miles on dry
land during her recovery. Most
of her time was spent on the
bike or running in the pool.

He said the lack of training
on dry ground put Schaeffer at
a deﬁnite disadvantage, as run-
ners get their conﬁdence and
best training running on land.

Thus, the training she
missed, not to mention a hip
ﬂexer problem she encountered
during her rehabilitation, were
two huge obstacles she faced
last week.

“Her being at nationals is a
hell of an accomplishment,”
Phemister said. “What she did
represented more in terms of
raw courage and determination
than most people can do.”

At Saturday ’s national cham-
pionship, hopes abound she can
improve on her 12th and eighth
place ﬁnishes of the past two
years. Yet, this may prove to be
her most difﬁcult race.

“l’m deﬁnitely not as pre-
pared as in the best,” Schaeffer
said.“It’ll take a lot mentally
and physically. This is a big
race.”

According to Phemister, it is
difficult to assess what
Schaeffer is capable of doing
because of having run just one
race in four weeks.“She can
have a race that doesn’t make
herAll-American,butone we’re
both happy with.”

The Generals 1994 season was very simi-
lar to the 1988 campaign. That year, the
Generals also won their last four games to
finish 5-3-1 after breaking out of the gate
with an 0-2-1 start. The Generals last won
four ina row in 1981.

‘‘I’m hoping for a good season next year,”
Fallon said. “Hopefully, the success from the
end of this season will snowball, and we can
roll it and roll it into a giant snowball.”

The men’s cross country team concluded a su-
perb season with a strong showing at the National
Collegiate Athltic Association Division III South-
east Regionals at Emory University in Atlanta,
Georgia by taking third place in the team competi-
tion behind champion Christopher Newport and
Mary Washington.

The Generals, like the week before at the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference Championships,
were led by a trio of freshmen. Jason Callen was the
first Generals’ runner to ﬁnish, taking 10th place
overall.

Will Olson and Taylor Schultz were the next two
runners across the line, followed closely by sopho-
more Sandy Hooper and junior co-captain Jeff
Zeiger.

Head coach John Tucker was generally happy
with his team’s performance, saying, “We were
pleased with the race although there was a sense we
could have done better.”

Callen agreed, saying, “We ran well, but not as
well as we could have. We didn’t achieve what we
wanted to (a second place ﬁnish) but it is something
to build on for next year.”

On his own performance, Callen, who missed a
trip to Nationals by two places, said, “Overall, I was
pretty happy with my perfonnance, but I was disap-
pointed to lose out to two guys from Lynchburg. I’m
only a freshman, so this is a good performance to
build on for the future.”

And the Generals do have a lot to look forward
to next year.

They return their entire team in defense of their
ODAC title, and a trip to Nationals is a realistic
goal.

According to Tucker, “There is a real sense that
this group can, and will, go places. The prospects
are good.”

Callen believes how far they go as a team next
year depends on their work ethic.

“There will be a number of strong teams, like
Mary Washington and Lynchburg, and what is
going to separate us from them is how hard we train,
how many miles we put in over the summer, and
how bad we want to win.” said Callen, “I think we
want it more than anyone else, and 1 like our
chances for Nationals.”

Observing Global AIDS Day A

Global AIDS Day was December 1 this year, and the AIDS Education Project sponsored an information center
outside the Leyburn Library. Numerous information pamphlets about making sex safer, options for protection
from sexual transmitted diseases, condoms, and AIDS awareness ribbons were place out for people to take. In
addition, there were large charts with information about AIDS and how it is transmitted.

Former W&L dean dies at 84

Law professor, security officer, and bookstore employee also mourned

By ETHAN KRUPP
Phi News Editor

Washington and Lee lost a former dean, a law
school professor, a security officer, and a bookstore
employee over Thanksgiving Break.

William Webb Pusey III, a retired dean, profes-
sor, and acting president of W&L, succumbed to
pneumonia at the age of 84 on Friday, Nov. 25. J.
Timothy Philipps, a professor at W&L’s School of
Law, died of cancer on Sunday, Nov. 27. He was 54.
Clarence A. Miller Jr., a W&L Security Officer, died
as a result of a heart attack on Friday, Nov. 18. Ruby
Clemmer Earhart, a W&L Bookstore employee died
on Saturday, Nov. 26, of cancer.

Pusey was a S. Blount Mason Jr. Professor of
German Emeritus and dean emeritus of W&L, in
addition to serving as acting president of the univer-
sity during his 42 years of service to the school. He
joined the faculty in 1939 as an associate professor of
German and was made a full professor in 1947. He
served as a dean of the college, W&L’s arts and
sciences division, from 1960 to 1971. Pusey was
appointed acting president of the university from the
time Fred C. Cole resigned in 1967, until his succes-
sor, Robert E.R. Huntley assumed the office
Feb. 5, 1968.

While acting president, he continued to serve in
the dual capacity of dean and chairman of the depart-
ment of German. From 1971 until his retirement in
1981, he returned to his first love: teaching.

During his 11 years as dean, Pusey directed a
series of changes that had a profound effect on W&L.
Faculty salaries were doubled, enabling the univer-
sity to attract and keep top-notch teachers; research
opportunities for both students and faculty were
expanded; the Robert E. Lee Research Program was
established and has since allowed hundreds of under-
graduates to engage in advanced research normally
undertaken only on the graduate level; the entire
university curriculum was reorganized; the academic
calendar currently in use was adopted; the number of
courses in arts and sciences was nearly doubled; a
program for honor students was developed; and the
faculty advisor system was reworked.

A 1932 graduate of Haverford College, Pusey
received his A.M. degree from Harvard University
from Harvard University in 1933 and his Ph.D.
degree from Columbia University in 1939. Pusey
was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron Delta
Kappa. During World War II, he served 39 months
in the United States Naval Reserves, reaching the
rank of lieutenant commander. He was cited for his
work as an interpreter in interrogating the German
Naval Command at the end of the war.

Besides his duties in the German department,
Pusey taught Russian Language and comparative
literature and was responsible for developing W&L’s
East Asian Studies Program in the late 1970’s.

A noted scholar, he wrote extensively on the topic
of German language and literature. His major ﬁeld
of study was German Impressionism, particularly the
writing of Eduard van Keyserling. His doctoral
thesis, Louis-Sebastien Mercier in Germany: His
Vogue and Inﬂuence in the Eighteenth Century, was
published by Columbia University Press in 1939, and

in 1943, he co-authored a textbook, Readings in
Military German. He was the author of numerous
reviews and articles in scholarly journals.

He also was the author of a comparative historical
examination and critique of W&L’s curriculum in
the period of 1850-80, and a study of the Ann Smith
Academy, an all-female school in Lexington during
the 1880’s.

Aside from scholarly pursuits, Pusey was an avid
baseball fan and once served on the board of directors
of the Lynchburg Mets, a Class A farm club of the
New York Mets. He also enjoyed walking, garden-
ing, and playing bridge.

At W&L, Pusey won two Ring-tum Phi awards
from the newspaper in 1968 and 1971. In 1981, the
student body established the William Webb Pusey III
Award, to be given annually to a member of the
faculty or administration who has given outstanding
service to the university. Pusey was the
first recipient.

He is survived by two daughters and
two grandchildren.

J. Timothy Philipps, a native of Wheeling, W.Va.,
had been a professor of tax law since 1980. Prior
coming to W&L, Philipps taught at Loyola Law
School (1977-80) and West Virginia University Law
Center (1966-76). He was a visiting professor at
Duke University in 1976.

He received his B.S. from Wheeling College in
1962, J .D. from Georgetown University Law Center
in 1965, and L. L.M. the following year from Harvard
Law School. At Harvard, he was a Ford
Foundation Fellow.

Philipps taughtcourses in individual income taxa-

tion, business taxation, and tax policy. He lectured
frequently on tax policy and was the author of numer-
ous articles on the subject. He spent a sabbatical
leave in 1993 as a law to U.S. District Court Judge
Frederick Stamp Jr. in Wheeling, W. Va. He also
served as a member of the ABA Section of Taxation’s
committees on attorneys in small firms and problems
of low income tax payers.

He is survived by his wife, two daughters, his
mother, two brothers, a sister, and several nieces and
nephews.

The family requests that in lieu of flowers, memo-
rial donations be made to the Rockbridge Area Hos-
pice (146 S. Main St., Lexington, Va. 24450) or the
J. Timothy Philipps Scholarship Fund (c/o Washing-
ton and Lee School of Law, Lexington, Va. 24450).

Clarence “Sonny” Miller, 57, spent 17 years work-
ing as a W&L Security Officer. Assistant Director of
Security Stephen T. Tomlinson characterized Miller
as “someone who never complained.” After being
diagnosed with lung cancer, Miller underwent sub-
stantial radiation treatment, but “never missed a day
of work,” said Tomlinson. The day before he died of
a heart attack, his doctor had informed him that his
attempt to overcome the cancer had been successful.

“He was an inspiration to [the Security depart-
ment] and to the university,” said Tomlinson.

He is survived by his wife and daughter.

Ruby Clemmer Earhart, 61, had worked for the
bookstore for almost 30 years when she died. A
native of Rockbridge County, she lived in Raphine.
She is survived by her husband, three daughters, son,
sister, three brothers, three half brothers, and
eight grandchildren.

Heatley suit
against W&L
tossed out

By SARAH GILBERT
Phi Executive Editor

Judge Duncan M. Byrd, Jr. dis-
missed the $1 million lawsuit against
Washington and Lee University Nov.
15, granting W&L’s motion for sum-
mary judgment.

The decision is a victory for Wash-
ington and Lee University, and is the
culmination of a year-
long battle former
professor Nathan
Rick Heatley has been
waging in the hopes
ofbeingcompensated
for what his lawyers
called “wrongful dis-
charge” from the uni-
versity in May of
1993.

Heatley’s lawyer,
Charles Smith III of
Gentry Locke Rakes
& Moore in Roanoke,
said they would de-
cide whether to ap-
peal the decision
“within the next
couple of weeks.”

In oral arguments Oct. 19, W&L’s
lawyers made a motion for demurrer
and summary judgment. In otherwords,
they contended that, though the facts
that Heatley presented may have been
true, they did not support his premises
of wrongful discharge and breach of
fiduciary duty and the case should
be dismissed.

Heatley’s lawyers quoted a clause
from the Virginia Code which they felt
should create a new cause of action, or
a new basis on which civil suits could
be brought.

In his decision, however, Byrd cited
cases from the Virginia Supreme
Court which he said supported
W&L’s argument. ,

In response to the three of the counts
of Heatley’s suit, I, II and IV, which
allege that W&L “terminated Heatley
without just cause and without follow-
ing it own procedures,” Byrd brought
up the Virginia “at will” employment
clause. This states that the term of
employment is indefinite an may be
terminated for any reason, unless some
contract exists between the employer
and employee.

Heatley’s lawyers insisted that the
personnel manual, the faculty hand-

Heatley

book and the student handbook consti-
tuted a contract between Washington
and Lee and its employees. But, be-
cause the contract was not “signed by
the party to be charged,“ as the Statute
of Frauds mandates, it was not holding.

Byrd used the Falls v. Virginia State
Bar decision as his basis on these
counts. In the Falls case, an employee
of the Virginia State Bar argued that,
since the Bar manual bore the Bar’s
logo, the signature
requirement was sat-
isfred. The Virginia
Supreme Court said
it did not.

On count III of the
suit,whichalleged“a
wrongful discharge
under Virginia’s nar-
row exception to the
employment-at-will
doctrine for retalia-
tory discharge in vio-
lation of public
policy,” Byrd
brought in the deci-
sion of Miller v.
SEVAMP, Inc.

This count-means
that Heatley’s law-
yers tried to establish a new cause of
action under a part of the Code which
states its purpose is to “protect citizens
of the Commonwealth against
unfounded charges of
unlawful discrimination.”

However, because the Supreme
Court decided in Miller that the excep-
tion was “not so broad as to make
actionable those discharges of at-will
employees which violate only private
rights of interest,” and Byrd felt that
the discharge of Heatley was a private
interest and not a matter of public policy,
he dismissed this count.

The ﬁnal count, IV, inwhich Heatley
alleged a breach of ﬁduciary duty, Byrd
wrote “Virginia does not recognize the
tort of breach of fiduciary duty.”

Heatley’s lawyer said the lawsuit
should be negatively received by many
people to whom it relates.

“I would imagine that the employ-
ees of Washington and Lee would be
surprised to find that the personnel
manual and faculty handbook which
ostensibly secure many contractual
rights are meaningless,” Smith said.

Washington and Lee’s lawyer was
out of his office this week and could
not be reached for comment.

Nicaragua trip planned
for Washington Break

cause she is a romance

By MICHAEL HEWLEIT
Phi Staff Writer

If you’re looking for a
place to go for February
break, you might
try Nicaragua.

Junior Jennifer Beam
has begun organizing a
group of Washington and
Lee students to travel to
Nicaragua from Febru-
ary 10-19.

Beam said she went
to Nicaragua in the sum-
mer of ’93 with Bridges
for Community, a non-
profit organization based
in New York City. She
planted trees and con-
structed a school.

She said she had a
good time.

“I thought it was an
experiencedifferent from
the normal W&L experi-
ence,” she said.

She said she went on
the trip to improve her
Spanish. She had been to
Mexico and Yonkers,
New York to do mission
work. Her church raised
money for her to go.

Students will have to
raise money for the trip
on their own. The trip
costs $1200, and a $500

deposit will be due on
January 1. The money
will pay for airfare, trans-
portation and food. Stu-
dents will be provided
housing, probably tents.
She said the students will
probably be working on
a school or housing
project. Beam said the
students would be
going with Bridges
with Community.

Beam said twenty-
ﬁve students have al-
ready shown interest in
the trip.

“I was overwhelmed
at the number of people
who have shown inter-
est,” she said. “It looks
pretty good.”

Junior Phaedra
Cianciulli said she
liked the idea of
helping people.

“I think it’s a good
project because it actu-
ally does something with
the people involved,” she
said. “You actually live
with and work with the
people you’re helping.”

Junior Lisa Smith said
she became interested
when she heard
about Beam’s trip
to Nicaragua.

She said the Nicara-
gua trip intrigued her be-

languages major. She
thought it was a way to
help people.

“We have a lot of op-
portunities to help out
within the Lexington
community,” she said.
“This is just an opportu-
nity to take that to an
international level.”

Beam went to Spain
last spring but has never
been to Central America.
She said she expects to
get a lot out of the trip.

Freshmen David Fos-
ter also thought the trip
was a great opportunity
to help people. He said
the school construction
project attracted him to
the trip.

“I think spreading
education and helping
people is a positive ex-
perience for those who
are going down to help
and those who are re-
oeiving the help,” he said.

Beam said the trip is a
rich, well-rounded edu-
cational experience in
that students can learn
things in any field.

“We’re trying to
heighten awareness
about developing coun-
tries, especially Central
America,” she said.

VMI’s Preston Library will be closed beginning in January due to renovations. During the twelve month renova-
tion period, library services will be moved to Lejeune Hall, the Ball Room on the second ﬂoor. Services and collec-
tions housed in Lejeune Hall will be circulation and reserves, reference; current periodicals, current government
documents, videotapes, CD’s, and microforms. Most of the book collection will be stored in a warehousein Lexing-
ton and the VMI library staff will retrieve items from storage daily. W&L students and faculty may call the VMI
circulation desk at 464-7228 to request items from storage to be picked up at Lejeune Hall. VMI’s online catalog can
be accessed for searching via Liberty. VMI faculty and cadets can continue to use the W&L libraries. Cadets must
sign out for a two hour period to use materials at W&L that are not available in their own library.

By PATRICK WILLIAMSON
Phi Staff Writer

This past Monday Executive Com-
mittee President Kevin Webb met with
the freshman class in Lee Chapel to
inform them of the procedures involved
in exam week.

Because the meeting was manda-
tory, the chapel was packed with first
year students eagerly awaiting what-
ever words of wisdom Webb might
impart to them regarding the week all
students dread.

The meeting actually turned out to
be a short one, because, as all upper-
classmen know, the process of sched-
uling exam periods is really

for the students, explaining the process
of obtaining envelopes, ﬁlling them
out and turning them in to the profes-
sors. In addition, he passed out infor-
mation sheets and sample envelopes to
all present which served as a reminder
of what he had just explained. After
passing out the sheets and folders Webb
proceeded to expound upon the honor
code and its place in the exam system.

“The"opp'oitunity to schedule your
own examinations is a direct reﬂection
of the honor system,” he said.

“Because of the faith the adminis-
tration and the faculty place in the
honor system and in you, you’re al-
lowed to schedule your own exams,
whenever you desire, within the
exam times.”

policy on
during exams.

“Self-scheduling of examinations
opens the door to temptation of dishon-
orable conduct,” Webb stated. He es-
sentially stated that students should be
responsible for their own actions and
that no aspect of any exam should be
disclosed by students to their upon
taking .the exam. He added that if
students ‘continue to uphold the honor
system and act in an honorable man-
ner, “the policy of self-scheduled ex-
aminations will continue to be a W&L
tradition for generations to come.”

Freshman students were naturally
not thrilled at the prospect of enduring
their ﬁrst exam week.

Another student had only good
things to say about the W&L
exam policy.

“If you need time to study for a
particular course, you can schedule the
time for yourself. I think it works
great. . . . For the most part, people
generally seem to care about the honor
system. Many of them came here for
that reason.”

As for themeeting, freshmen were
supportive but tended to agree that
they ’ d rather be spending their evening
doing something else. “The meeting
was helpful in a way. It was needed.
But ten minutes, come on. It was kind
of a waste for them to drag us all out
there for such a short meeting,” re-
marked a student.

Students, Howison discuss mandatory sophomores housing

By Joanna Soto
Phi Staff Writer

Students voiced their opinions on the possible
change in the university housing policy at an open
forum Wednesday night.

Dean Howison organized the forum to get student
reactions on issues that currently face the university.
The main topic of discussion was the possibility of
requiring sophomores to live in campus housing.
The class of 1999 will be the first class to be affected
by the policy.

The idea came about at a Budget and Audit
committee meeting last spring. The administration
wants to create an environment that balances resident
and financial life. Dean Howison told students that
the change in policy was not the university’s way of
raising money.

“Washington and Lee’s budget is as rock solid as

it ever was,” said Howison.

As it stands now only 75 percent of Gaines and
Woods Creek are occupied. If Sophomores were
required to live on campus it would bring an addi-
tional $200,000 in revenue.

Howison said that the money would be used to
improve student life. One possible use for the money
would be the construction of a student center. How-
ever, no new construction will take place until the
science center is completed.

Howison also said that by taking one hundred
students out of the housing market would put pres-
sure on landlords and real estate agents to lower
prices or improve conditions.

Dean Manning sees the change as a way to im-
prove relations between the students and
the administration.

“I think we need to put more emphasis on institu-
tional loyalty and building community,”
Manning said. .

The students at the forum expressed some con-

cern over the notion that you must sacriﬁce freedom
for community. Other students felt that a sense of
community could not be forced, but must
be voluntary.

One student even went as far as to say that a sense
of community was not worth having to live in Gaines.

“I’d rather live in a dump than in Gaines,” said
junior Andy Olmem.

There were students that felt that it was not unrea-
sonable for the university housing policy to
be changed.

Senior Noelle Parrott thought that sophomores
would appreciate not being rushed into having to ﬁnd
a place to live their sophomore year.

“You shouldn’t have to Worry about signing a lease
when you need to be concentrating on your studies,”
Parrott said.

“Besides, I don’t think living one more year on
campus is too much to ask of students.”

For those students that didn’t get to voice their
opinions, another open forum will be held in January.

Christmas weekend plans to keep students busy

By PETER WEISSMAN
Phi Staff Writer

From Santa hats to gag gifts, Washington and Lee students today begin the
festive rituals of Christmas weekend.

While standard fraternity activities include cocktail parties and bands tomor-
row night, some houses will celebrate with their own traditions.

At Pi Kappa Alpha, sophomores will read a Christmas poem that pokes fun at
the brothers, said president Allen Gillespie. At Sigma Phi Epsilon, pledges will
mock the brothers in a skit and challenge them in a football game. Pi Kappa Phi
president Alan Christensen said the brothers will entertain underprivileged
children Friday afternoon. Phi Kappa Sigma will hold its annual formal dinner,
and Sigma Chi will have its annual semiformal. At Sigma Nu, the brothers are
having their annual formal and plan to keep their fireplace burning from Thursday
to Sunday.

“Whenever people come in, there will be a ﬁre going,” said president
Stephen lnman.

Professors will also have a chance to enjoy W&L’s last Saturday before ﬁnals.
Chi Psi, SAE, and Sigma Nu will host faculty receptions.

Christmas activities are not limited to fraternities. The Pi Beta Phi sorority
will hold a faculty reception Monday. Kappa Kappa Gamma will take pictures
with Santa outside the Co-op for the United Way Wednesday, said philanthropy
chairman Ashley Matthews. Senior Sarah Gilbert said that Xi Pi Xi, “W&L’s
newest sorority,” will hold a Christmas formal next Saturday. The Minority
Student Association will host a party for Lexington children at the Chavis House
Saturday afternoon, said MSA secretary Nova Clarke. Service fraternity Alpha
Phi Omega will initiate seven pledges Sunday and go caroling next Saturday, said
APO president Josh Cook.

Tonight, the Student Activities Board will begin Christmas Weekend with the
band Hootie and the Blowfish at the Pavilion.

“I think we’ve caught a band that is on it’s way up,” said SAB entertainment
director Drew Denbo. “If you like rock and roll, you’ll like these guys.”

SAB President Michael Weinfeld said that tickets have sold well, thanks in
part to extended sale hours and interest at nearby colleges.

Students of drinking age should bring identification to enter the beer garden,

said assistant W&L Security director Steve Tomlinson.

“It should be a good time for everybody although I’ve never heard of Hootie
and the Blowﬁsh,” Tomlinson said.

Law enforcers are also preparing for the big weekend.

Lexington Police Chief Bruce Beard said students should watch out for
underage drinking, drinking in public, and public intoxication.

“We will have the force beefed up for the weekend,” Beard said. “I
recommend that [students] stay inside and keep the music down.”

Alcohol Beverage Control ofﬁcers won’t be on campus because they were not
requested, said ABC Public Relations Coordinator Robert Chapman.

W&L Security and Lexington police can handle the job, Tomlinson said. As
in recent years, security ofﬁcers will visit fraternity houses.

“We’ll have somebody dropping by if time permits,” Tomlinson said. He said
that students should use common sense and not congregate outside parties.

With a wide variety of social traditions, W&L students have many reasons to
look forward to Christmas Weekend. PiKa’s Gillespie offered one reason.

“To ﬁnd out who’s been naughty and nice.”

Scheduled bands for
Saturday Night:

Chi Psi, B, S, & M,

Kappa Alpha, The Stegmonds

Kappa Sigma, Southern Legends

Lambda Chi Alpha, Doug Clark & The Hot Nuts
Phi Delta Theta and Beta Theta Pi, Uncle Mingo
Phi Kappa Psi, The Press

Pi Kappa Alpha, Fighting Gravity (formerly Boy 0 Boy)

‘Passion and con roversg color Come Down Burning

’ Plagwrighl Kia Corthron eloquentlg wrestles with the abortion issue in Lenfests latest production

By DAN ODENWALD
‘E Phi Staff Writer

  

Kia Corthron believes that important and
valuable theater needs to have passion.
This would explain why the widely ac-

" claimed playwright focuses on current contro-

versial political issues. Political debates stir
emotion and feeling, and that is precisely what
Corthron wants.

“I consider my play a success if just one

A person leaves the theater differently than he

came in,” said Corthron.

Come Down Burning , a 1993 play written
by Corthron, will be part of the play reading
series offered by the Lenfest Center this week-
end.

The work focuses on three black women
growing up in poverty in a small Southern
town. The play deals with the emotional issue
of abortion. Moreover, the work questions the
plight of poor women faced with matters of

‘ choice.

“The central political issue was that of choice.
The play is about overcoming barriers. I focus
on sibling rivalry and health issues,” said
Corthron. Corthron also examines the contrast
between female characters, one of whom is
paralyzed.

“I wanted to compare the power between the
women in the play. The main character is
physically handicapped, but is the most psy-
chologically powerful,” said Corthron.

Theater professor Tom Zeigler sought
Corthron after their mutual agent recommended
her work. After reading her play, he decided
that as a member of the Glasgow Committee, a
group with access to an endowment fund that

pays for visiting performers, he "
would invite Corthron to Wash- ’
ington and Lee.

“The play was exciting be-
cause it’s controversial. The
characters are forced to make
extreme decisions because of
the economic pressures on them
which is a result of their race,”
said Ziegler.

Zeigler is also interested in
audience reaction, especially at
W&L. .

“I’m very interested in see-
ing how the students will re-
spond,” said Zeigler.

Corthron was unable to pre-
dict how W&L audiences will
receive her play.

She did comment, however,
on a similarly conservative
Connecticut audience who had
recently seen her play.

“Some people were visibly
moved by the play, while oth-
ers were quite hostile,” said
Corthron.

Corthron expects varying
emotional responses from au-
dience members when they see
her plays.

Politically, she classifies
herself as more liberal than
Bill Clinton.

Therefore, she is met with
some disagreement from the
more conservative elements in
her audiences.

Her stands on political issues come out in
her plays because she chooses to write about
them.

“A lot of theater is passionless. It doesn’t
make you think, and while entertaining, it’s
mostly mindless sit-com,” said Corthron.

A 1992 MFA graduate from Columbia University, Kia
Corthron‘s works have won numerous awards, including the
1993 New Professional Theatre Play Writing Contest andthe
Delaware Theatre Company's contest.

Given the new hostility to the political-
correctness movement, it would seem that
Corthron’s ideas would be subject to attack.
The playwright doesn’t believe in political cor-
rectness as an idea.

“Personally, I believe the term came from

conservatives as a way to im-
ply that one’s beliefs are both-
ering someone else. Every
person should be allowed to
listen to their conscience,”
said Corthron.

Corthron is currently
working on a play that deals
with the death penalty. The
plot centers on historical ﬁg-
ures Nat Turner and Crazy
Horse, both of whom
Corthron considers remark-
able people, who are on death
row.

Undoubtedly, the play will
spark an interesting debate
on capital punishment.

Ziegler chose C omeDown
Burning because he wanted
to involve more students in
Lenfest productions.

“We look for every op-
portunity to get more students
involved in the department.
For this play, we looked for
more minority students espe-
cially,” said Ziegler.

In fact, the entire cast is
made up of members of the
Minority Students Associa-
tion.

“It’s a disturbing play be-
cause it deals with abortion in
a time before Roe v. Wade.
It’s more about a relationship
between two sisters than about
abortion,” said Michael
Hewlett ’96, one of the play’s performers.

The play reading series is an experiment of
Lenfest, and the staff hopes to get a positive
response.

Students in Zeigler’s play writing class
will have their original work presented Satur-

Interview with the Vampire — rﬁnfr

Interview with the Vampire is a very
interesting ﬁlm, but it leads a double
life. For all the fans of Anne Rice out
there, it is surely a work to be savored,
a splendid, beautiful and gilded movie
that finally brings all those readers’
personal imaginations to the big screen.
But for the rest of us who haven’t
read her books, it is merely a gaudy,
confusing and thoroughly sordid tale.
The premise is that a young re-
porter, Malloy (Christian Slater), is

I interviewing a vampire, Louis (Brad

Pitt), whom he has met on the streets of
San Francisco. His recollections
form the body of the movie. M .. 3,
He begins in 1791, in New
Orleans, as a rich, young, re-
cently widowed, plantation ..
owner. He is approached by the '
vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise) who  .

offers him the chance at immortal- 5.

ity and a new life.

Louis accepts, only to quickly dis-

cover that he is still too in touch with
his human side: he hates killing people
just so he can feast on their blood.
Instead, he must suck the life from rats,
chickens, poodles, etc.

Lestat ﬁnds this absurd, and re]-
ishes the death of at least one fresh, ripe
maiden a night. The tension between
the two steadily increases, and Louis
considers leaving behind his
compatriot’s wicked ways.

But, Lestat won’t have that, so he
creates a family for them, by vampire-
izing a young girl, Claudia (Kristen
Dunst). The three become the best of
friends as they go on theirnightly quests
for that red, red wine.

Over the years, tensions come up,
and the three become increasingly tired
of one another.

Claudia is especially resentful be-
cause she will never grow up and be-
come a fully-bosomed woman; when
Lestat turns a deaf ear to her problems,
she decides to kill him.

First she has him drink blood from
a corpse (apparently quite bad for a
vampire’s constitution), then she slits
his neck and has Louis throw him in the
swamp for the alligators to prey upon.

But killing a vampire is no easy
task. Lestat comes back with a ven-
geance, and ﬁnally Louis must set him
aﬁre to stop him. Louis and Claudia
decide to leave America to search out
other vampires around the world.

They search futilely for many years,
but ﬁnally come across a whole horde
of them in Paris, led by the graceful
Armand (Antonio Banderas).

It turns out that Armand is looking
for a vampire in touch with the modern
age, and he thinks Louis is the best man

  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
    

for the job. And, Louis discovers that
Armand is willing to answer all those
questions about vampires Lestat
wouldn’t touch.

Unfortunately, the other vampires
have all heard about Claudia’s attempts
to do in Lestat and are quite upset she
tried to kill one of their own kind. _

They capture her and expose her to
the sunlight, crumbling her to dust.
Since Louis was her accomplice, they
decide to lock him in a cofﬁn for a
hundred years, walled up in the dark
depths of their catacombs.

Armand comes to the rescue, and is
able to get Louis out of the cofﬁn, but
too late to save Claudia. Louis is so
heart-broken over the death of the girl,
whom he had always considered a
daughter, that he decides to burn all the
vampires to death as they sleep in
their cofﬁns.

The result is lots of gore,
and the only

people 1 e f t
standing from the
mess are Armand and
Louis.

Armand hopes that Louis will join
him in a new beginning, as two thor-
oughly modern vampires learning to
love life again. Louis rejects this idea,
and instead moves back to New Or-
leans on his own.

Then one night, after having
watched Tequila Sunrise at a movie
theater, Louis begins to poke around an

old, deserted house.

Inside, he ﬁnds none other than his
old friend, Lestat, now quite weak as
far as vampires go, but rarin’ to get
back out to the killing, if only Louis
will help. Louis refuses, and walks out
of Lestat’s life.

By this point the story has ﬁnally
returned to the present day, and so at
the end of the interview Malloy is left
absolutely stunned by all that he
has heard.

He wants Louis to make him a vam-
pire, too. But Louis is still a discon-
tented vampire, and realizes he has
utterly failed to convince Malloy of the
psychological hell that being a vam-
pire is. Louis storms out angrily.

The movie ends as Malloy drives
away (to a Guns ‘N’ Roses version of
“Sympathy for the Devil”); in the very
end he is caught by a feeble Lestat, who
is willing to give him the same chance
he gave to Louis two-hundred years
previous, and thus start the cycle all
over again.

This movie is marked by a tremen-
dous richness, a wealth of fabrics and
colors and music and sets.

Director Neil Jordan does an ad-
equate if uneven job telling the story,
occasionally lapsing into long, slow,
tepid shots before jumping back into
sudden, harsh, quickly clipped shots.
The difference is unsettling and not
appropriate to the luxury of the scenes.

But the acting is pretty good consid-
ering the bizarre characters the actors
are performing.

There is a certain melodrama about
the way the lines are delivered, either
shouted in anger or whis-

fulness;

perhaps that
is unavoidable
when playing these noble, evil crea-
tures of the night.

The big huff over the choice of Tom
Cruise for Lestat seemed overblown to
me. He neither butchered the job, nor
did he excel particularly; on the whole,
Antonio Banderas and Kristen Dunst
have the strongest performances,
though Brad Pitt does a ﬁne job as well.

The biggest drawback is the screen-
play of the movie. For someone who
has actually read some of Anne Rice’s
works, this movie might seem totally
different, but I was confused through-
out.

It is clear that Rice wants to address
not just the romance and mystery of
vampires, but also the everyday prob-
lems they might face, and even the
deeper metaphysical problems they
would consider.

So some silly, mundane things get
emphasized way too much. For ex-
ample, there is astrong veinofbloodlust
running through the ﬁlm, focusing on
where Louis will ﬁnd his next meal;
blood runs constantly and plentifully

pered in feigned  mg“ 

day night, along with Corthron’s play on Friday
night. Zeigler points to the beneﬁts of play
reading as opposes to full scale productions.

“The play reading focuses on the writer.
The audience sees the script alone. With full
scale productions, many people inﬂuence the
work from the director to the actors. The script,
itself, may be lost,” said Zeigler.

Time constraints also was a factor in choos-
ing to do play readings. With the short time
available between the close of the fall produc-
tion and the Christmas Break, play readings are
ideal for they require less preparation than an
elaborate production.

Louise Uffelman, Lenfest Center Assistant
Manager, said, “The play readings offer some-
thing different and provide for a different kind
of theater. It’s more informal and ﬁts into the
schedule.” I .

Audience members are invited to remain
after the performance to discuss the plays.
Audience members can voice their opinions
and share any thoughts about the presented
work.

Uffelman expressed concern about the
plethora of other activities planned for this
weekend that would compete with the play
readings.

With the Hootie and the Blowﬁsh concert
sponsored by the Student Activities Board and
the fraternity Christmas formals scheduled at
the same times as the play readings, audience
turnout may be limited.

Nonetheless, the Lenfest crew is hoping for
a healthy showing.

ater. Original student works by Megan Duncan

will be presented on Saturday night at 8:00 p.m.
Uffelman is uncertain if the play reading series
will become a regular event at the Lenfest

in most of the shots.

Conversely, some very interesting
points receive attention that we might
not normally think would be addressed.

For example, the fact that vampires
never age means that Claudia will never
grow up, a point of anger for this forty-
year old pre—pubescent.

Similarly, Louis is very much op-
posed to taking human life, the most
natural thing in the world for a vam-
pire. The result is a sort of twentieth-
century existentialist vampire, one
caught up in a struggle against his
own nature.

Movies are fun when they construct
a fabulous, imaginary world we can
escape to for hours. But they also must
not create a world with question marks,
and that is what Interview with the
Vampire does.

We are ﬁlled with numerous unan- of Forrest Gun-9%
swered questions about the characters  ,

and vampires in general. ”<f»§§
How does the ’
feeble Lestat live
V since hecan’tleave
his house to eat?
Why sleep in
cofﬁns and not just
dark rooms?
Where do Louis and
Lestat get their fabulous
= ' wealth? Can vampires have
children? Why is Annand so
fascinated by Louis?
The subject matter is exotic
and mysterious enough for a thou-
sand questions to leap into your
mind, and it is frustrating for them not
to be answered.

Interview with the Vampire is a
sumptuous film, with plenty of blood
and lots of cool-looking characters.
There is a healthy dose of humor, not
enough to detract from the drama of
the plot.

But we are left with many questions
about what is going on. Unless you
have read the novels, you are likely to
be left mystiﬁed by this glittering, con-
fusing ﬁlm.

It’s probably worth seeing at a dol-
lar theatre, but I think it’s too serious to
be much fun as a rented video on an
alcohol-soaked Friday night.

Rating Scale

ﬁrﬁrﬁrrfz - Go buy this as soon as it comes
out on video. It is an instant classic. “You’ll
laugh; you’ll cry; and maybe, just maybe, you'll
learn something about yourself.”

rm-rt -Go see this film now, while it’sstill
on the big screen. It’s worth a few Oscar nomi-
nations and the seven bucks you'll pay if you
see it outside Lexington. Overall, “Better
than Cats!”

{H}-Okay,sotherehave beenbetterﬁlms.
Nevertheless, it is a good example of its genre,
and you should probably see it on videotape.
Still, probably “Better than Cats!”

*1‘: - It happens to be on HBO, and you’re
blowing off tomorrow’sreading. Although your
time would probably be better served on your
education, its free and you’re bored, so go
ahead and watch it.

0 - Even if its free and your best friend said
he never laughed harder, trust me, this one

sucks. Don’t waste your time, or at least don’t
waste it on this. (There's always MTV.)

Keep your god out of my public school

THE FAR MIDDLE

Alex’ Christensen

Prayer in school has become a hot
issue recently, due to Newt Gingrich’s
miscalculated, Clinton-gays-in-the-
military-esque sop to the extremists in
his party, declaring that a constitu-
tional amendment to allow voluntary
prayer in public schools will soon see
the light of day in the new
Republican Congress.

I believe in prayer in school. There
were many times when I was in the
public schools when I would stop and
say a little prayerto Thor, asking him to
destroy one particular enemy or other
of mine with his mighty thunder ham-
mer, Miolnir. It was important to me.
I wore a silver thunder hammer around
my neck almost every day. Religion
was a part of my daily life, at home and
at school, or wherever I was. Yet not
once in my entire career did I suggest
that everyone shut up while the teacher
or myself or another student stood up
during class time and prayed aloud or
silently to the god of thunder.

This was and is a pretty basic idea to
me. I won’t bother you about not
worshipping Thor, as I do, and you
won’t bother me about not worship-
,ping Jehovah, Jesus Christ, Allah,
iBeelzebub, etc. We can all study to-
-gether and work together without the
bother caused by bringing religion
into everything.

Of course, had I chosen to attend a
Lutheran school or a Catholic school, I
would have had no choice but to go
along with whatever prayers or cer-
emonies they required of their students.

- But I didn’t.

I went to a public school, and if
anyone had tried to pray aloud during
class, to my god or any other, I would
have asked him to remain quiet, or

leave. I would have been perfectly
within my rights. I did not attend
school to be proselytized or forced into
any denominational or
nondenominational worship. I attended
school to learn.

So why are some people (a great
majority if you believe the polls, which
I tend not to) so
insistent on ei-

attention was not demanded by
classwork, between classes, at recess,
at lunch and after school. Nothing has
to be enforced, no one has to be forced
to endure another’s religious practices.

Let’s see. ..it’s not to solve any prob-
lem, it’s not a free speech
issue...hmmm...maybe if we all think

they cannot. School is for learning,
and I don’t have to pay my tax dollars
to respect your prayer when I am there
to learn. Just to make it fair, you don’t
have to respect mine either. The Con-
stitution very much carves out a place
for freedom from religion as well as
freedom of religion. I’ll respect your
religion when
you practice it

ther teacher— or
s t u d e n t - l e d
prayer or a “mo-
mentofsilence”
in which
s t u d e n t s
may “reflect”?

It’s not be-
cause things
started going
downhill in this
country when
prayer was
taken out of the
schools. As
Madalyn Murry
0 ’Hair, founder
of American
Atheist and the
plaintiff in the
Supreme Court
case which took
prayeroutof the
schools has said, people have been
praying everyday in churches and
homes across America, despite the de-
cision on prayer in schools, and the
problems we faced are still with us. So
why force little Jewish, Buddhist and
Norse pagan school kids to pray every
day to Christianity’s god? If this pray-
ing were going to solve our crises, it
would surely have done so by now. It
obviously has little effect.

It’s not a free speech issue. As long
as it does not disrupt the class, a student
could pray nearly all the time in a
public school without being punished
or bothered. If parents chose, they
could teach their kids to pray before

Yrayer, I think a moment of

silence is like kissing

yourself and

  

      
    

hard, we could come up with a
reason...thinking?...think hard...

Hey, I’ve got it! It’s pretty simple,
actually. They want your children.
They want them as a captive audience,
forced to either participate in or watch
others participate in worshipping some
arbitrary deity (whichever one has the
most adherents in a particular school
district, presumably the Christian god
in most of the country). In some less
polite circles, it’s called “brainwash-
ing.” lt’s practitioners have been re-
ferred to as “the Thought Police.”

Couldn’t students who don’t want
to pray just be quiet and respectful for
one moment while those who do want
to pray do it silently? My answer is no,

lllin) other words, sure,
lm in favor of ii.

 

don’t try to force
it on anyone
against their
will.

The very ex-
istence of a mo-
ment of silence
suggests that
praying is a thing
for which author-
ity ﬁgures, who
represent the
government and
who presumably
command re-
spect among stu-
dents, have set
aside a special
time. No atheist
students or stu-
dents whose reli-
gions forbid pub-
lic prayer or require elaborate praying
rites feel comfortable having their be-
liefs denigrated by the state in this way.

To you Christians who still are not
convinced, go back to Matthew, to the
Sermon on the Mount, and find out
what Jesus said about prayer in public.
He called those who do their good
works or pray in public hypocrites and
he told his followers that their prayers
should be private, between them and
their god. Ostentatious or enforced
displays of piety are not Christian.

Prayer is wonderful, in school or
out, as long as there is no coercion, or
even implied endorsement. Let’s just
leave it out of the daily curriculum of
our public schools.

The Hot Zone combines drama and science

Richard Preston creates a story about a virus frighteningly echoing AIDS

By MICHAEL Hr~:wLr:'r'r
Phi Staff Writer

Everyone knows about the HIV vi-
rus. Oommercials and advertisements
abound in popular culture, stressing
the importance of safe sex.

Use a latex condom or practice
abstinence, they say.

Recently, Pedro Zamorra, who be-
came famous on MTV’s Real World,
died.

AIDS has ravaged Africa and caused
devastation in the United ates. It takes
approximately ten years or the victim
to develop full-blown AIDS.

But what if there was a virus that
could kill you in a matter of three to
eighteen years.

What if a virus caused symptoms so
frightening that you would rather blow
your brains out than suffer.

What if this virus could wipe out the
entire human population—a biologi-
cal nuclear bomb.

And what if this virus appeared in
your own neighborhood.

Well, according to Richard Preston,
author of The Hot Zone, this virus
exists along with others that could pos-

sibly mark the end of the human race.

The ﬁrst chapter presents a harrow-
ing scenario. A Frenchman named
Charles Monet travels to Mount Elgon
in Africa.

A couple of days later, he begins to
get severe headaches. It could be the
flu or malaria or any other obnoxious
disease you get in the jungle. But it’s
not.

And he gets worse and worse as he
attempts to make it to the Nairobi Hos-
pital.
He has a “hot” virus named Marburg.
It has killed countless numbers of
people. It literally eats the host inside
out until the victim is nothing more
than a mess of blood and virus.

Worse still is the Ebola virus, espe-
cially Ebola Zaire. “Ebola Zaire at-
tacks every organ and tissue in the
human body except skeletal muscle
and bone.

It is a perfect parasite because it
transforms virtually every part of the
body into a digested slime of virus
particles.”

It destroys the brain, causing
depersonalization.

You cease being who you are. Your
emotions, personality, intelligence—
all of these things disintegrate.

This sucker kills nine out of ten

victims. In other words, if you get it,
you can count on dying and dying
violently.

It only takes one person to allow
the virus to spread. Because of extreme
ampliﬁcation, tons of virus could ﬁt
onto the period at the end of this sen-
tence.

It can go anywhere in the world,
including the United States.

In 1989, monkeys that came from
the Philippines start dying in huge num-
bers in Reston, Virginia, which is out-
side of Washington, D.C.

It starts in Room F, but it starts
killing monkeys in other rooms in this
monkey house.

How? Could it travel through the
air? And what would happen if this
virus gets into the human population?
Only one monkey worker would have
to contract the disease to completely
wipe out every living person in Reston.

Preston contends that Ebola and
AIDS are part of a pattern. As human
beings continue to clear away the rain
forests, dormant viruses are being
awakened.

“In a sense, the earth is mounting
an immune response against the hu-
man species. It is beginning to react to
the human parasite, the ﬂooding infec-
tion of people, the dead spots of con-

crete all over the planet, the cancerous
rot-outs in Europe, Japan, and the
United States, thick with replicating
primates , the colonies enlarging and
spreading and threatening to shock the
biosphere with mass extinctions.”

This seems to be a specious argu-
ment, and I had a somewhat hard time
swallowing it.

Is he promoting a political agenda?
I doubt it, but it does make you wonder.

Nevertheless,Preston writesascary
book. What this disease does to human
beings frightens me.

This virus exists and could come
back. I omitted some of the more sick-
ening aspects of the symptoms.

You should not read this book while
eating a Dominos’ pizza.

Preston writes in a clear language
so the average reader can understand
the how these viruses work. He pre-
sents a compelling mix of drama and
scientific fact.

From the first chapter, he draws the
reader into the story and characters and
does not let go.

Preston gives new life to the notion
that fact is often stranger than fiction.
This book will stay with you a long
time.

And you just might have a little
trouble sleeping, but it will be worth it.

Lately the W&L men’s bas-
ketball team seems to be emulat-
ing the U.S. Postal Service’s Pri-
ority Mail campaign. Just count
it: 2 tournaments, 2 wins, 2 losses,
and a career-high 29 point game
for junior forward Cam Dyer.

The team opened their season
with the Washington and Lee Tip-
Off Tournament, facing Amherst
in the ﬁrst round. Led by Dyer’s
29-point effort and double ﬁg-
ures from 2 other players (Mark
Connelly’s 16 and Chris
Couzen’s 11 points), the Gener-
als were in command for most of
the game.

Amherst managed to cut the
lead to 2 points at 67-65 with
nine minutes remaining, but like
the Postal Service, the Generals
delivered late, as Freshman
Jimmy Schweer hit the glass for
a putback that marked the begin-
ning of the 9-0 run that cemented
the 85-72 Victory.

The Generals then faced the
Tufts Jumbos in the champion-
ship game, but fell just short in
the tough 80-74 defeat. Tufts
grabbed a 14-4 lead early, but
Cam Dyer cut the lead to 2, and

during the year.

Thus far, the senior captain has responded with
a 16 point, seven rebound average in the opening
tournament of the year. To follow that, he added an
11.5 point, 5.5 board average at the Carnegie-

Mellon Tournament.

Connelly’s consistency helped the Generals
notch two wins in four games between the two

tournaments.

Senior Mark Connelly knew going into the sea-
son that he would be called on to lead the Generals

the Generals trailed by only 2
with one minute left in the ﬁrst
half.

Tufts answered with a shot
from downtown in the ﬁnal sec-
onds, and then scored the ﬁrst
eight points of the second half to
cement their lead.

Connelly tallied 16 again and
Dyer added 14, but poor shoot-
ing hampered the Generals’ at-
tack, as they hit only 40 percent
from the ﬁeld and 56 percent
from the foul line.

For his efforts, Connelly was
named to the all-tournament
team, posting averages of 16
points and seven rebounds a
game. 6

The Camegie-Mellon Tour-
nament next greeted the Gener-
als, and once again, it was Dyer
and Connelly that led the way. In
the opener against Oswego, Dyer
recorded 23 points and 11 re-
bounds to help the Generals cruise
to victory, 80-56. Connelly con-
tinued his strong efforts with 10
points and ﬁve rebounds.

In the next match versus Alma,
the shooting slump again hurt the
Generals early, as they shot only
26 percent from the ﬁeld in the
ﬁrst half. ,

Connelly had a team high 13
points and Derek Carter hit the

Athletes of the Week

boards for eight rebounds, but
Alma deﬂected the Generals’
second-half comeback to win
66-55.

Next up for the team was the
beginning of their season in the
ODAC, with a home opener
against Hampden-Sydney
Thursday night.

The Generals once again got
off to a slow start, shooting only
39 percent from the ﬁeld in the
first half.

Poor free throw shooting by
Hampden Sydney and a late
three pointer kept the Generals
close at the break as they trailed
only 43-37.

W&L opened the second half
hot and tied the score at 46
before Hampden Sydney went
on a run to put the Generals
behind by as many as 16 mid-
way through the half.

The Generals fought back,
narrowing the margin to one
twice at 75-74 and 85-84 in the
ﬁnal minutes.

A time-out call with no time-
outs left and the Generals trail-
ing by three sealed W&L’s fate
as they ﬁnally succumbed 88-
84

The next opponent for the
team is the Guilford as the Quak-
ers come to town on Saturday.

 

Sandra Holmes

Junior Sandra Holmes has kept her momentum
from last season going through the start of the 94-
95 season as well.

In the Haverford Tournament, Holmes aver-
aged 16.5 points and a little over seven rebounds a
game, including a 17 point 10 board outburst, on
her way to taking all-tournament honors.

As an encore, Holmes tallied 13 points and 17

Women get off to slow start .

Phi Staff Writer

The women’s basketball team
dropped their second straight
conference game of the season
Thursday night at Lynchburg.
The Generals were beaten 70-55
by the Hornets, falling to 2-3 on
the year, 1-2 in the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference.

Lynchburg opened the game
with 15 unanswered points and
held off the Generals the rest of
the way. W&L had closed to
within 41-38 in the second half,
but could get no closer.

Junior Stacey Williams scored
13 points to lead W&L, and added
nine rebounds. Junior Sandra
Holmes and senior Amy Vogt
registered eleven points each.

The Generals had evened their
record at 2-2 Tuesday night in
Lynchburg with a 60-54 come-
from-behind win against
Randolph-Macon Women’s Col-
lege.

Trailing by as many as eleven
in the second half, the Generals
used a decisive foul shooting
advantage to reclaim the lead in
the final seconds. Freshman
Rachel Read (9 points) hit four
clutch free throws down the
stretch.

For the game, W&L went to
the foul line ten times more than
the Wildcats and converted 24-
of-39. That helped overcome an
8-for-32 second half shooting
performance that dropped the
Generals from a one point half-
time lead to the eleven point defi-
cit.

Holmes was the game’s high-
scorer with 22 points. She also
grabbed 14 rebounds in her 33
minutes of work, eight off the
offensive glass.

Williams had 20 points and
nine rebounds, while Allison Hull
dished out four assists.

The Generals opened their
season during the Thanksgiving
break with third place ﬁnish at
the Haverford Tournament. They
dropped the first game to

Albright, 58-49, despite forcing
31 turnovers by the Lions.
Holmes topped W&L scorers
with 16 points.

In the consolation game,
Chestnut Hill was held to six
second half points as the Gener-
als marched off to an 82-21 win.
Williams netted 22 points and
Holmes registered 17 points, 10
rebounds and seven steals.

The team’s ODAC season
began with a home loss to
Roanoke the Tuesday before
Thanksgiving. Despite Holmes’
13 points and 17 rebounds, the
defending conference champs
posted an easy 75-41 victory over
the Generals at the Warner Cen-
ter.

Though the Maroons went on
to a 34-point win, Roanoke coach
Susan Dunagan felt it necessary
to continue to apply full-court
pressure late in the game, believ-
ing the win was not yet secured.

The Generals will be home
again Saturday at 4:30 for an-
other ODAC contest as they host
Emory & Henry.

Thanks to Keith Grant for
great job. Good Luck
next term, and if you ever

Fall Term Grades

By ETHAN KRUPP
Phi News Editor

The report cards have arrived and Pi. ,

Beta Phi and Sigma Phi Epsilon are at
the head of the class.

Pi Phi had a grade point average of
3.243 and Sig Ep’s GPA was 3.091.
Chi Omega was the second highest
sorority and Lambda Chi Alpha was
the second highest fraternity

The 2.994 all-student GPA was
lower than all four sororities, the all-
women, and non-sorority women, but
higher than 12 fraternities, all-men,
and non-fratemity men.

Dean of Students Dean Leroy
“Buddy” Atkins said he was happy to
see three fraternities above a 3.0, par-
ticularly since “the sororities have been
it for a while.”

Dean of Freshman and Residence
Life Dennis Manning also said the
freshman class GPA “was excellent
and much improved from the
midterm grades.”

Manning also said that the number
of students below a 1.5 GPA
was “typical.”

The statistics provided by the Dean
of Students Office state that 14 fresh-
man men received grades lower than a
1.5. Last year, 14 freshman were be-
low a 1.5, and in 1993, 19 were below
the 1.5 mark.

Atkins offered advice to “chapters
that find themselves in the bottom half
year in and year out...can escape it if
they make academics a priority
for both the chapter and
individual members.”

All of the general GPA categories
remained fairly constant over the last
two years. No GPA has moved more
than 0.1 points since 1992.

After one year of campus suspen-
sion, Phi Gamma Delta fraternity has
returned to Washington and Lee Uni-
versity with an intention to focus on
the future.

“We’re just glad it’s over,” said FIJI
president Stephen Cokkinias. The Stu-
dent Affairs Committee voted unani-
mously Dec. 9 to reinstate the frater-
nity Jan. 1.

The fraternity was suspended for 18
months last winter after being found
guilty for violating the university policy
on hazing, but agreed to complete a 10-
step plan of action so that the SAC
would lessen the sentence.

“It was no longer an issue of who’s
right andwho’swrong,” said Cokkinias.
“It was an issue of what can we do to
get back on campus. We worked very
hard over the past year, and we com-
pleted each of the 10 points.”

The plan of action asked that FIJI
show the SAC that there had been
changes in attitude and behavior. Dean
of Students David Howison, who is
chairof the SAC, sent a letter to student
leaders informing them of
the reinstatement.

“The Student Affairs Committee
commended the leadership of FIJI for
its dedicated and successful efforts to
achieve a special 10-Point Plan of Ae-
tion...” Howison wrote.

Ralph “Moke” Wolfe III, last year’s
FIJI president, said he was
“freaking ecstatic.”

“I was not happy about the whole
situation, but I’m glad its behind us.
Now we have a situation that we can
build a fraternity on.”

Both Cokkinias and Wolfe said they
wanted to concentrate on the future of
the fraternity rather than the past.

“I hope that there’s going to be
something positive to come out of this,”
said Wolfe. “I hope the university will
say, now lets really attack the problem
of hazing. This isn’t about FIJI any-
more, it’s about hazing.”

Cokkinias hoped to concentrate
on brotherhood.

“The attitude of the brothers is that
the whole situation has brought our
house closer together,” he said.

FIJI now plans to hold an informal,
deferred rush, kicked off by a party
Saturday night with the band Blue
Miracle at the FIJI house.

“There has been a group of people
who have expressed interest in joining,

but we have not torn anyone yet,”
Cokkinias said. “We hope to form a
pledge class over the next few weeks.”

Cokkinias and Wolfe were looking
toward the party as a sort of re—intro-
duction of FIJI to the campus.

“We want to let freshmen know that
there really is a 15th fraternity on cam-
pus now, and it’s going to operate just
like any other fraternity,” Cokkinias
said. He said their social calendar for
the rest of the year will be similar to the
rest of the campus fraternities, and will
include a semi-forrnal, a mixer, and the
traditional FIJI Islands in April.

Cokkinias is looking forward to
being able to address the campus as a
fraternity once again.

“When you’re away from campus
for 12 months, a lot of questions arise
that you are not able to address, a lot of
rumors get started that are false. We
will be glad to have a chance to clear up
any misconceptions in the next few
months,” he said.

Wolfe, who will be visiting campus
this weekend along with several other
alumni to celebrate the return of FIJI,
was looking forward to the party.

“I will be drinking many beverages
to celebrate the good judgment of the
SAC,” he said.

EC, Contact clash over lack of
speakersandsunused money

By MICHAEL Hswuzrr
Phi Staff Writer

Political inﬁghting has kept Contact from getting more
prominent speakers, according to some Executive Commit-
tee members at Monday night’s meeting.

Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork and former Sur-
geon General C. Everett Koop have fallen through as speak-
ers. Contact brought three speakers last fall: John Berendt,
author of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Repub-
lican congressman Bob Goodlatte and Edward Cleary, au-
thor of Beyond the Burning Cross.’ The First Amendment
and the Landmark R.A.V. Case. 1

“It seems they’ve been unable to succeed at anything
they’ve tried,” said EC president Kevin Webb.

_Webb said a struggle between the liberals and conserva-
tives in the organization has been going on all Fall term. He
said the group has been unable to resolve disagreements
about speakers.

Webb expressed concern about giving money to an
organization that has not done anything.

“I have serious problems with the leadership living up to
their responsibilities,” he said.

EC law representative and Contact member Jim Pike said
Contact’s problems aren’t the fault of one person.

EC vice-president Alex Cross said the blame for Contact’s
problems must be placed on the president, senior
Andrew Schneider.

‘‘In any organization, the president has a responsibility to
the student body,” he said, “to bring speakers to the school
regardless of whether they agree with the choice of speaker
or not.”

He said Contact has only spent only a fraction of the
money allotted to them.

“My opinion is that if we give (an organization) $30,000,
they should spend the money,” he said.

Pike said although there has been disagreement about
speakers, much of the dissension has been resolved.

Pike said the problems started when Contact decided that
a consensus should be the rule which often made it difficult
to choose speakers. He said this was done because Contact
had been criticized in the past for the tendency to bring
conservative speakers. Contact now has a 2/3 majority
requirement to decide on speakers.

Pike said another problem has been unavailable speak-
ers. He said the speakers they have brought to the school
have been cheap.

Cross said if the speakers have been cheap, then Contact
should have spent more money and bring more speakers ——
not less.

Schneider said the group has committed about $8000. He
said the rest of the money has not been spent because
speakers such as Bork and Koop have fallen through.

“If you look at other Contact committees, the major
speakers weren’t booked until the second semester,”
he said.

Schneider said there had been inﬁghting last semester
over speakers, especially Lani Guinier, the former nominee
for the Civil Rights division in the department of Justice.
President Clinton withdrew her name from the nomination
amidst controversy over her legal writings.

“The whole idea of Lani Guinier was to provide a balance
to Robert Bork since they had opposing views,” he said. “A
lot of people on Contact felt she was a liberal crackpot.”

The committee decided against bringing Guinier to cam-
pus, but the American Civil Liberties Union, the Minority
Student Association, and other organizations are bringing
her to campus in February.

Schneider said the political inﬁghting has ended and
things are going smoothly this term. Contact has already
booked Helen Thomas, UPI White House correspondent,
forJanuary 31 and Richard Preston, author of The Hot Zone,
for March 9.

Contact as well as other organizations will meet with the
EC in the next two weeks to discuss budget concerns.

“The EC can rest assured that we’ll be spending its
money,” he said. .

Seasonal Affective Disorder might
storm in during the Winter months

By DAN ODENWALD
Phi Staff Writer

Is the winter the worst time of year
for you? Do you feel more depressed?
Do you overeat? Are you exhausted all
the time? Do you lack motivation for
your daily activities? Do you feel guilty
about your increased lethargy during
the winter?

Well, don’t. It’s possible the prob-
lem isn’t you. You may be experienc-
ing symptoms of Seasonal Affective
Disorder, or what’s more commonly
referred to as SAD.

Formally recognized by the Ameri-
can Psychiatric Association in 1987,
Seasonal Affective Disorder is a psy-
chological and physical ailment that
touches over 20 percent of the United
States’ population.

It’s characterized by a depressed
mood during the winter months due to
the lack of sunlight. Cases can range
from nagging doldrums to clinical de-
pression. Evidence shows that SAD
affects four times as many women as
men and may be hereditary.

SAD is the physical and psychologi-,
cal response of the body to the winter’s
increased darkness and cold. During
the winter, the days become shorter.
There is less sunlight. Researchers have
determined that the lack of sunlight

causes signiﬁcant changes in seasonal
body rhythms. This affects the pro-
duction of the hormone, melatonin.
Generated by the brain during the night
hours, melatonin induces fatigue which
makes the body rest. During the winter
months when the nights are longer,
more melatonin is produced and the
body feels overly tired. In addition to
fatigue, a SAD sufferer may also ex-
perience greater depression, increased
appetite for carbohydrate—rich foods
which produce energy, and loss in
interest in daily activities. In effect,
the brain is being starved of sunlight
which would inhibit the production
of melatonin.

Aside from the very real physical
ramiﬁcations of SAD, there are also
pronounced psychological effects.
SAD sufferers are more depressed dur-
ing the winter. They crave energy-rich
foods and tend to overeat. This results
in weight gain which introduces nega-
tive feelings of guilt. Patients show a
noticeable decrease in interest for their
daily activities. Closely related to that
is the lack of motivation to start and
complete tasks.

Dr. Norman Rosenthal, Chief of
Environmental Psychiatry at the Na-
tional Institute of Mental Health, is
especially concerned with children
who suffer from Seasonal Affective
Disorder. According to his estimates,

more than a million teens suffer from
SAD. Like other SAD sufferers, they
are battered by fatigue and depression,
however they may be misdiagnosed.
To explain their lack of interest in
school, many teens with SAD are often
labeled as having Attention Deﬁcit
Disorder which is more commonly as-
sociated with lack of attention.

The good news is SAD is treatable
with light therapy. Patients are in-
structed to sit for one hour a day in front
of a panel of light which is a bright
broad-spectrum‘—artiﬁcial light with
characteristics similar to sunlight. Re-
searchers claim that SAD patients have
shown dramatic improvements within
four days of treatment.

Michael Terman, Director of the
Winter Depression Program in New
York, says that 75 to 90 percent of
patients are successfully treated with
light therapy.

The light boxes, themselves, can be
very expensive. The average price is
$400. Accordingly, doctors have sug-
gested less costly ways to combat SAD.
The use of more lights around the house
is strongly recommended as is getting
out more during the daylight hours.

Associate Dean of Students Anne
Schroer-Lamont, a University Coun-
seling Psychologist, believes Seasonal
Affective Disorder is not common on
the Washington and Lee campus.

‘‘I have diagnosed at least one stu-
dent with SAD. In most cases, there are
other factors which cause depression
in students,” Schroer-Lamont said, “Al-
cohol abuse, smoking, and lack of ex-
ercise are more commonly associated
with winter depression than SAD which
results solely from light deprivation.”

However, Schroer-Lamont did
agree that some students may be suf-
fering from SAD and choosing not to
seek help from University counselors.
She also stated that the University
Counseling staff is capable of identify-
ing SAD.

“Some students may be experienc-
ing SAD and not getting help. Some
involve mild cases where the student is
capable of handling it on his own,
while others may have severe cases
and should get help,” she said.

Schroer-Lamont is especially inter-
ested in nutrition and proper exercise
as a way to cope with winter depres-
sion. She advocates that students take
extra care to make sure they exercise
during the colder months.

“With the lack of outdoor activities
during the winter, students need to ﬁnd
alternatives for exercising outdoors,”
she said.

“Using the indoor track, campus
weight rooms, gym facilities, and
aerobics are more important in the win-
ter than in the warmer months.”

The President of Croatia intends to end the UN peacekeeping forces in
Croatia. Sources say this could lead to expansion in the war in the Balkans.
Diplomats say this is a further indication of the unwillingness of both

parties to accept the help of mediating forces.

The House Judiciary Committee approved Wednesday a balanced
budget amendment that requires a three-fifths majority to raise taxes. This
amendment is opposed by moderate Republicans and conservative Demo-

crats. The House will vote on it in two weeks.

The Senate approved Wednesday night a bill to force the House and
Senate to comply with the anti-discrimination, safety and other workplace
rules that they impose on other employers. The bill was part of the list of
Republican campaign promises that helped that helped the party win
elections Nov. 8. The legislation promises, according to the GOP, an end

New evldencesays OJ beat, threatened Nicole

By PETE WEISSMAN
Phi Staff Writer

Wearing a black, 1970’s jumpsuit and a red ban-
danna, Sigma Phi Epsilon pledge Dan Tipton moved
across the stage like a Russian folk dancer as he
mouthed the words to “Celebration” by Kool & the
Gang. The 575 students in the Pavilion that night
cheered the act, and the judges awarded Sig Ep first
place in last year’s “Lip Synch” contest.

On Jan. 20th, the ninth annual “Lip Synch” con-
test returns to Washington and Lee to entertain stu-
dents and help the hungry. Students Against
Rockbridge Area Hunger will sponsor the event and
give 90 percent of the proceeds to local food pantries.

“lt’s one of the few times that the entire school has
the opportunity to come together,” Tipton said. “You
get a chance to show off or be an idiot, and it’s OK.”

“It’s kind of like a party atmosphere,” said public-
ity chairman Emily Hazlett. “It’s fun music, and
you’re watching your friends up on stage.”

“This is a big-time show,” said Jerry Darrell,
event founder and director of University
Food Services.

Last year, 24 groups, most of them Greek organi-
zations, participated. The Minority Student Associa-
tion ﬁnished second for their version of “Whoop,
There It Is!” Third place went to the Chi Omega
Seniors who did “If” by Janet Jackson.

Four-man Fifth Beat j ams
at the Coffeehouse

According to Hazlett, dance routines and songs
from the ’70s and ’80s are popular. The best acts are
well-dressed, well-choreographed, and “people are
singing the right lyrics,” Hazlett said. Tipton sug-
gested that groups practice a lot and wear
memorable costumes.

The contest has changed through the years.

“Nine years ago, we began this event in the Pit
with four acts,” Darrell said. “Because of the tremen-
dous response on campus, the event was moved to the
Pavilion a few years ago.”

In past years, MTV sponsored a national lip synch
contest. Two W&L acts competed in the ﬁnals in
Florida and won: Fiji in 1990 and Sig Ep in 1992.
When MTV ended their contest, the W&L competi-
tion continued.

Planners also changed who the event helps.

Originally, Students Against Multiple Sclerosis
sponsored the event to beneﬁt the National Multiple
Sclerosis Society. Last year, the group gave some of
the money to the Rockbridge Area
Relief Association.

This year, they changed their name to Students
Against Rockbridge Area Hunger and will use 90
percent of the proceeds to buy food for ﬁve local food
pantries. The other 10 percent will go to
multiple sclerosis.

“We expect to raise about $4,000 this year,”
Darrell said. He said that he will buy food at 14 cents
a pound from the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank in

Lip Synch could bring in $4000 for food

Verona and deliver it to local food pantries
for distribution.

“I think about the logistics of getting [the food]
here,” Darrell said. “We may need a convoy.”

Ellen McCoy, RARA’s director, said that last
year’s lip synch money helped the non-proﬁt organi-
zation move to a larger food pantry. She said that
food contributions would help RARA provide

' other services.

“If I don’t have to go out and buy $300 worth of
food, then I can go out and help six families keep their
electricity on,” McCoy said. .

Darrell hopes other groups in addition to fratemi-
ties and sororities will participate.

“We’re really looking for participation from cam-
pus organizations,” Darrell said. “We’d love to have
some faculty/staff acts.”

Groups of up to six participants can sign-up at the
Snack Bar from Jan. 16-19th. The entry fee is $30.
Spectator admission is $4. The doors open at 9 p.m.,
and the beer garden is open to those with proper ID.

Beth Provanzana, SARAH chairman, said judges
will rate the groups on choreography, costumes, and
lip synch. First prize is $100 and two Fancy Dress
Ball tickets. Second prize is $50 and 2 FD tickets.
Third prize is $50.

“We were performing with the purpose of helping
others in need,” Tipton said.

“It makes it truly worthwhile and not just a show-
case of talent.”

The State

Dispute disrupts General Assembly

An angry dispute forced the Virginia General Assembly to adjourn
Thursday and Governor George Allen to give his annual State of the
Commonwealth Address on TV. It was the first time in Virginia history that
a governor has been blocked from delivering his opening day speech
directly to the assembly. The argument arose when Republicans and
Democrats disagreed over procedural powers, after which the Democrats
adjourned and walked out without adopting any rules.

General Assembly meets to discus Allen's proposed cuts

On Saturday, Jan. 7, the four-man
band Fifth Beat played in the Pit.

The Coffeehouse was sponsored by
the Society for the Arts and
Student Activities.

Fifth Beat consists of four Wash-
ington and Lee juniors: David Olimpio,
Dan Vesay, Todd Bryan, and Pat White.
The band formed in September and
played a coffeehouse in the fall. Vesay,
Bryan, and Olimpio formed the band
last year, and recently added
drummer White.

The four come from a varied musi-
cal background. Olimpio, who plays
piano, came from a musical family.
While he played in the high school
band and picked up piano as a high
school sophomore, he never really took
formal music lessons.

Vesay, the trumpet player, picked
up his instrument in the fourth grade.
He played jazz in high school and is
currently a music major and a member
of the W&L orchestra.

Bryan is also a member of the or-
chestra. He got his start in music when
his mother made him play violin at age
10. He then moved onto the string bass
and now plays the electric and

traditional acoustic jazz and electric
funk fusion. Some of their music is
improvised and most of the electric
stuff is original. Their musical recipe
drew a turnout Saturday night. Audi-
ence members ranged from faculty to
students to the guests of students.

Michelle Richardson, coordinator
of student activities, estimated Fifth
Beat drew between 75 and 100 people.
Richardson likes working with students
because it not only gives them an op-
portunity to showcase their abilities,
but usually their friends turn out to
support them.

As for Fifth Beat, she says, “Dave,
Dan, Todd, and Pat are so easy to work
with. They are funny and easygoing. I
thought they were great.”

Richardson’s job is to schedule al-
ternative events on the weekends. So
far, she has been pleased with turnouts.
She concedes she could probably draw
a larger crowd if alcohol was made
available, but since she was hired to
have alternative events to fraternity
parties she has chosen to make them
non-alcoholic.

“Besides,” she says, “What’s a cof-
feehouse with alcohol? A coffeehouse

“My 5-year-old takes me

Crichton shatters traditional
stereotypes of sexual harassment

A NOVEL

.. iJ.S.. $5.99

{E3Bal‘1satine:‘¥iclion£39tGS. G.’-:3’

By MICHAEL HEWLETI‘
Phi Staff Writer

In 1991, the issue of sexual harass-
ment exploded onto the political scene
during Clarence Thomas’ nomination
to the Supreme Court. Anita Hill be-
came the beloved of feminists while
Thomas’ appointment to the highest
court in the nation helped usher record
numbers of women into political of-
fice, including Carol Moseley-Braun,
the ﬁrst black woman senator.

Usually, sexual harassment is seen
as women being victimized by male
employers. But what if a woman sexu-

this is exactly the situation Michael
Crichton describes in his book,Disclo-
sure. Before you see Michael Douglas
and Demi Moore heat up the screen in
the movie version, you might check
out the book.

Thomas Sanders is a divisions man-
ager for Digital Communications Tech-
nology (DigiCom) in Seattle. The com-
pany is in the midst of an acquisition by
which a corporation called Conley-
White. If things go well, Sanders could
end up a million dollars richer. He is
also in line for a promotion, something
he believes he deserves because of his
dedication and hard work over the
past decade.

When he arrives at work, he finds
out that a woman has been named to the
position he wanted. Even worse, this
woman turns out to be his former girl-
friend, Meredith Johnson, and he must
work for her. Although he is disap-
pointed, he decides to make the best
out of the situation and tries to erase the
awkwardness of working for a former
lover. Unfortunately, Johnson has dif-
ferent ideas. »

In a private meeting, Johnson comes
on to Sanders, seeking to rekindle their

ally harasses a male employee? Well, -

sexual relationship. Sanders refuses,

- inciting Johnson’s rage. The next day,

Johnson makes a complete fool out of
Sanders when she changes the approach
for the meeting that they had agreed
upon the night before. She also hits
Sanders with a charge of sexual harass-
ment, making him the victimizer in-
stead of the victim.

As Sanders tries frantically to save
both his job and his marriage, he begins
to discoverthat he is essentially power-
less to an apparent plan to bring him
down. Since Johnson is tied to the
company’s power structure, she inevi-
tably gets the support of the
company while Sanders is left
completely isolated.

While the book is primarily a sus-
pense thriller, Crichton does want to
make a point-——a somewhat valid point
at that. He argues that sexual harass-
ment is about power and exclusively
the domain of men. Women can sexu-
ally harass and will increasingly do so
as they gradually break the glass ceil-
ing of Corporate America. As one char-
acter concludes, “A harassment claim
is a weapon...and there are no good
defenses against it. Anybody can use

the weapon—and lots of good"

people have.”

Whatever your views on sexual ha-
rassment may be,Disclosure is simply
a good book. Crichton constructs a
fast-moving, suspenseful story. With
sparkling dialogue and technological
mumbo-jumbo for those engineering
and computer science majors, the story
moves with force and energy. There is
never a boring moment in the book.
Although the events in the book take
place within a week, Crichton enables
the reader to really know the primary
characters and creates enough intrigue
to satisfy those who love it. Whether
the movie is as good as the book is
something you will have to ﬁnd out by
yourself. But if you are looking for a
book that’s hard to put down, Disclo-
sure qualiﬁes.

Drop Zone combines bad acting, dull dialogue

 
 

skydivers who would be able to pull it off.

Eventually Pete ﬁgures out it was the work of ex-
DEA agent Ty Moncrief (Gary Busey), who plans to use
Leedy’s computer skills and his own skydiving abilities
to break into the DEA’s headquarters and steal the names
of undercover drug agents, which he will then sell to
drug dealers.

Of course, in the end the forces of righteousness win,
and the bad guys are either caught or killed — though a
few of the good guys go down, too.

By KIRK SUSONG
Phi Movie Reviewer

The first thing you will notice if you see this ﬁlm is how
bad the acting is. The promise that Wesley Snipes showed
in NewJack City has completely disappeared, slowly fading
through Demolition Man, Passenger 57, and now Drop
Zone. He is wooden beyond the worst Stallone — no
small feat!

Unfortunately, his fellow actors can do nothing to rescue
him, as their performances are equally mind-numbing.

But no one sees action ﬁlms for the acting, so let’s move
on to the relevant parts.

 

Drop Zone — ‘ﬁn’?

Drop Zone is just another action ﬁlm, but don’t let that
immediately dissuade you. About as good as Under Siege,
it is not in the same class as the greats like Die Hard, The
Crow, or C liﬂhanger, but remains a cut above run-of-the-
mill genre pieces like Bloodsport.

U.S. Marshal Pete Nessip (Wesley Snipes) gets suspi-
cious after terrorists fail to hijack a 747, yet somehow still
manage to escape from the plane. When it turns out that
criminal computer nerd Earl Leedy (Evening Shade’s
Michael Jeter), whom Pete was moving between prisons, is
also missing, the marshal becomes even more convinced the
hijacking failure was actually a carefully planned
mid-air jailbreak.

Unfortunately, his superiors refuse to listen to him, and
Pete is eventually suspended. Nevertheless determined, he
entwines himself in the incestuous world of
daredevil skydivers.

He befriends Jessie Crossman (Yancy Butler) who is one
of the few skydivers in the world capable of pulling off an ‘
in-ﬂight jump from a 747, as the hijackers did.

She turns out to be innocent but knows all the other

Now you an have the molt tecoﬁmud ~

The plot itself is not as transparent as the typical action
film, so we don’t quite have it- all ﬁgured out from the
beginning. That does make it easier to enjoy the action,
which is the real saving grace of Drop Zone.

Snipes can’t match the pure grace and athleticism of Van
Damme. His scenes are also not as well-choreographed as
the Dutchman’s, which often seem almost lyrical, so expres-
sive and smooth.

However, Snipes is just as much fun to watch; he has
more pure power, a certain animal vigor that exudes raw
strength. When he punches someone, you get the same
feeling as when watching a powerful hit in football.

He is able to keep his motions tight, controlled and
extremely forceful.

Combining this draw with the ﬁlm’s real hook, skydiv-
ing, is very appealing. The ﬁlm’s creators were bright
enough to essentially avoid any sort of silly mid-jump ﬁght.
They keep the action on the ground and just use the world of
skydiving to make the ﬁlm more exciting and beautiful.

John Badham’s directing is nothing to write home about,
but it’s competent enough for the ﬁlm. More importantly, he
allows Snipes to take center screen whenever the action gets
intense, so our focus is never distracted from Snipes’ power.

Essentially, the ﬁlm is a lot like every other action film
out there. The acting is atrocious, the dialogue is predict-
able, and the directing is boring.

However, the tension inherent in skydiving, together
with Snipes’ direct, powerful, and enthusiastic action se-
quences, prove to be the ﬁlm’s salvation.

Drop Zone is deﬁnitely not worth a trip to Roanoke, and
it probably shouldn’t be one of your stand-bys should you
arrive too late for the ﬁlm you really wanted to see. How-
ever, if action is your cup of tea, then it is probably a good
bet for the dollar theater in BV or a video rental.

Rhetorical questions...

We have many, many rhetorical questions which pop into
our heads at this time of the year, and we will give them to you,
our readers: perhaps you will come up with some answers for
them. If so, give us a call.

Why is it that women take more time to prepare for
impressing other women than for men? (If you don’t believe
us, the smell of the perfume is probably still lingering through-
out the University Center. Sniff for yourself.)

How much money is wasted in crepe paper in the United
States every year? Is it recycled? Maybe this is the problem
with the landfills.

Why is it that we are perenially number three in the
Princeton Review’s hard liquor rankings? What does it take
to unseat number one?

Why does it matter which despressive pyschological dis-
ease one has? If you have one, and are too paranoid to go to
a counselor in fear of what he or she might tell you, what then?

What is the point of parties anyway? Is it the drinking? Is
it the hook-ups? Would we be okay without them? Do we
really have fun when we are too upset to talk about what we
did the next day?

What are New Year’s resolutions? What is the point if they
only last for a year?

Is something, for which one has to develop a taste, really
good once one develops the taste, or are we just fooling
ourselves?

Why do people find musicians so fascinating? We all know
that traditionally fantasically popular musicians are rather
depraved, so why is it that we are drawn to these types of
people?

We are not really clinically insane at the Phi, just rather
confused. If you have some answers to our questions, please
write or call. We will be grateful.

‘Equality’ myth threatens America

NICHOLAS L.
WADDY, ’96

 

This column is Part Two in a series
on the many virtues of
Western Civilization.

Last time, if you recall, we con-
cluded that civilization is built on three
elements: learning, charity, and order.
It was promised you, furthermore, that
in this week’s column I would unfold
the greatest mystery of all: where our
civilization stands by these criteria.
That is, are we in America civilized? If
we are, is anyone more so, or has any-
one ever been more so?The expedient
answer, and the one that will keep me
safe in the streets, is that America is the
most wonderful thing since sliced
bread, and that surely no higher level of
civilization has ever been achieved than
that practiced in modern-day Cleve-
land. I, in refuting this idea, must of
course ﬁnd fault with America on the
basis of one of the three criteria I pro-
posed earlier. And so I shall.

I wish to make it clear at the outset
that, while I may define what is essen-
tially ‘American’ differently from oth-
ers, I remain very much a patriot. That
said, it is in the arena of public and
social order, not surprisingly, that I
shall find fault with the United States.

One of the principal purposes of a
social order is to be stable. No form of
respectable civilization can long sur-
vive under conditions of basic instabil-
ity. I would have to admit that, rela-
tively speaking, things have gone quite
well in America thus far in this respect.
It has become almost trite in recent
years to observe that cracks have be-

gun to appear in the American social
fabric, but this is undeniably the case.
We in the conservative community
commonly like to reduce this trend to
rock music and feminism, but the more
inherent threat to America comes, para-
doxically, from what has usually been
seen as its strength: its founding prin-
ciples. I mean the principle of human
equality in particular.

Equality, we must understand, is an
ideal state. Hierarchy and inequality
are actual states. Even in America some
people rule and some do not. Some are
rich, and some are poor. Put yourself in
the position of those poor downtrod-
den sods that exist in our country no
less than in any other. What are they

Even if we concede that the down-
trodden in America have as much op-
portunity to change their lot as the
lower orders of society do anywhere
else, we must still face the fact that the
majority of poor people were born
poor and they will die poor. So with
what comforting world view do we
arm the poor that they may meet their
fate with dignity(or at least sanity)?
Equality. We announce that all men are
created equal. The response that can-
not help but jump into the minds of the
poor is, of course, “then why are we so
much less equal than you?”

There are only a few possible an-
swers. One is that the poor are innately
inferior, and that they deserve to be in

offered exactly the

change this.

deprived of a fair chance at life’s re-
wards. This tack is consistent with the
idea of human equality, but is other-
wise rather unappealing for the obvi-
ous reason that those of us who are
placed a tick above the ‘average’ mark
do not enjoy the prospect of being

leveled. Finally, one popular idea is
that the rich, though having begun equal
to the poor, have simply worked harder
and thus achieved more‘. But this does
not square with equality either, since
the rich man would either have to have
been born an innately hard worker (im-
possible) or he must have learned his
hard-workingness from his
hardworking forebears (constituting an
unfair advantage).

The point of all this is that, as far as
I can see, the poor do not have any good
reason to accept their position in Ameri-
can society. They are told that they are
fundamentally equal, but their reality
does not conform to this idea. The
results of this problem are readily seen.
The poor in America have been wait-
ing for the day when they will get what
they think they have coming to them,
and what most of them will never have
- equality. In the meantime they feel
justified in causing disorder and in
disobeying the laws and mores of an
‘unjust’ society. The collapse of order
in the underclass threatens American
society as a whole.

It may be seen that the doctrine of
equality, which is being taken more
and more seriously in America all the
time (it has always been touted, but
seldom taken to its present extreme), is
inimical to social stability, particularly
to the stability of any kind of class
system, and must therefore be taken as
contrary to the spirit of civilized life.
What it should be replaced by, and
what society should serve as the model
for a new form of social organization,
will be made clear in Part Three.

Not surprisingly, our model soci-
ety with respect to Social Order is also
our model of civilization in general.
What society, past or present, will make
the grade? In two weeks you shall
finally know...

Republicans need to rethink Contract

NOVA
CLARKE,
’96

 

It’s a new year and there is a new group in charge
of Congress. Last week, the media was full of stories
about the new Republican majority and their plans to
fulﬁll their their “Contract With/On America”. In
the background, beyond all the pomp and circum-
stance and the almost all nighter they pulled on the
first day of the new session are some questions posed
by, among others, the Democrats in Congress and
Constitutional scholars.

The House passed a rule change requiring that a
3/5 majority be required to raise income taxes. This
brings up the Constitutional question. Scholars
argued that the Constitution set forth speciﬁc mea-
sures that required more than a simple majority vote.
These measures include impeaching the President
and overturning a veto. The Republicans argued that
there was nothing expressly forbidding such a rule
change, and that it had been done before. It has, in
cases such as the requirement for a 2/3 vote to break
a filibuster in the Senate. In those cases, however,
these super-majority votes apply to all subjects, not
to a speciﬁc action or a speciﬁc area of domestic
policy. Why won’t a 2/3 vote be required to lower
income tax, since that affects the country as much as
an increase does? Perhaps a tax cut affects the
country more, because revenue is decreased.

There is also the question of the Balanced Budget
Amendment. It is unquestionably a broadly sup-
ported move among a diverse group of people. But
what will the effects be of such a move? It was
pointed out in a recent commentary on National
Public Radio that under provisions of the bill, if
revenue drops, for example during a massive period
of unemployment, spending must necessarily be cut.
A better move might be to pour money into the
economy, perhaps running a small deﬁcit, but stimu-

lating economic growth and recovery.

The Democrats have challenged the Republicans
to publicly announce what they plan to cut. It
obviously won’t be defense, since the Republican
majority seems to think that our defense is being cut
so drastically that England could take us over as a
colony again (I think that with all the NRA members
with semi-automatic weapons, we would have
them outgunned).

Speaking of England and the colonies, the Re-
publican majority
seems to be following
in the footsteps of King
Georgelll. They have
taken away the voting

sary but unpopular with the voters.

If the federal government is going to take some of
the pressure off the states, perhaps the states should
take some of the pressure off the federal govemment-
by stocking up on private ﬂood or disaster insurance,
for example, so that every time an inevitable natural
disaster occurs, they don’t go running to the federal
government for relief.

There are many, many things that will happen this
year. Resolution of the term limits question, welfare
reforms; the beginning
of what is sure to be a
never-ending debate
on school prayer, et
cetera. Then there is

majority that appear reasonable, such as not giving
the states unfunded mandates. As a Floridian I see
the logic in this statement. After all, Florida is
spending money on all the immigrants coming in
without any additional revenue from the federal
government. There is another side to this however. It
is these mandates that allow so much to be accom-
plished, including integration of the schools, pro-
tecting the rights of the disabled, and preserving the
environment. It also gives the governors something
to hide behind, and keeps away the wrath of the
people when he or she does something that is neces-

which to judge the Republican majority, the reap-
pearance of bowling leagues. Will the Republican
party fulﬁll its goal of reestablishing community in
America? Will suggests the success can be gauged in
by the growth of voluntary associations not interest
groups, but the gathering of people who have a
mutual interest and enjoy each other’s company. If
the Republicans achieve this, then they will have
done a wonderful job.

It’s only the second week of the new era and too
early to predict success or failure. As the main
character of one of last year’s most popular movies
said, “Life is like a box of chocolates, you never what
you’re going to get.” The Republican majority is like
that; who knows what will come out of anything?

OPINION "““—

Keep your Christmas with you

GREEN LAND
Betsy Green

l’ve decided that even though it’s
not especially timely, I’m going to
write about my Christmas. For one
thing, my writing about it now goes in
the spirit of a song from Christmas Eve
on Sesame Street called “Keep Christ-
mas With You.” (Pretend I’m singing
now.) “When Christmas is over, save
some Christmas cheer!” (Okay, you
can stop pretending now.) Besides, I
can write about whatever I want. If you
have a problem with it, get your own
humor column! Wow, that felt really
good. Okay, on to the spirit of peace on
Earth and all of that good stuff.

My brother (“The Boy”) announced
once that from Thanksgiving on, our
lives are ruled by tra-
dition. The festivities
kicked off with The

Boy checks his watch and we race out
of my mom’s car while humming the
theme song to Mission Impossible. We
have already had the whole
“Howdoesthistreelookokayﬁnelet’sbuyit”
conversation by the time Ray Pruit
lopes over to ask us if he can help us.
Mom demands to know the price of the
tree and is ﬁlling it in on hercheck (pre-
dated and signed, of course) as The
Boy and I race to the hatchback of her
car and stuff the tree in. This year, the
tree was bought, paid for, and in the car
in one minute and eighteen seconds, a
new record.

The holiday merriment continued
for me because I got to work at the mall.
Yay! Mycareer in the exciting world of
French fashion (i.e. sales associate at
Express) never fails to provide joy.

year didn’t have lines like “Yo, I aint

Uncharacteristically I (I’m switching
my punto de vista, Professor Boetch)
was eager to get home to my family. A
man came in to buy a present for his
wife and was taking his sweet time,
oblivious to the fact that we all kept
looking at our watches. I finally got
him to choose something, hurried him
to the cash register, and rang him up. I
was getting ready to start folding clothes
so I could go home when he came up
behind me and asked if I had remem-
bered to give him his change. It was
about seventy-eight cents. I remember
that, but I didn’t remember if I had
given him his change. I was honest
with him and told him that I didn’t
know. Damned honor code. I told my
manager the deal and
she forced a smile and

Oh, well. This year to
torture The Boy I put
a dab of shaving
cream on his cake in lieu of ice cream.
His friend Jeff decided that it would be
even more fun to put the shaving cream
(lime scented, of course) in his hair as
well. Others got into the fun by coating
his head with chocolate syrup, ketchup,
oatmeal, and chopped nuts. He looked
like the Ponderosa sundae bar gone
awry, but at least his hair wasn’t as bad
as Richard Weaver’s.

Another fine family tradition is the
purchase of our Christmas tree. None
of us really feels that a great amount of
time is needed to pick out silly things
like Christmas trees or wallpaper.
Hence, we wait until the coldest day of
the year in order to expedite the pro-
cess. While all of the perfect families
are looking at all of the trees from all of
the angles, we move a bit faster. The

sounds completely plausible to them.
There was one man that I regretted
waiting on. It was Christmas Eve. I was
being my cute little Mall Chick self in
a red sweater and Santa hat and I of-
fered my services as a fashion consult-
ant toaman who waswandering around

one) when I realized why he

money. Do you all
detect bitterness?
Anyway, as you as-
tute readers must have
guessed, this was the
same guy.

Flashback ends.
We return to 1994.
Luckily the whole ordeal wasn’t as bad
this year. I only had to call the credit
card company to conﬁrm that the guy
was legit. To be honest, I kind of en-
joyed it.

Christmas Eve proved to be inter-
esting this year because my mom de-
cided to add drinking to the usual fam-
ily festivities. We sat in front of the fire
and roasted hot dogs (a staple of any
holiday meal) and drank wine. We also
ate a big jar of maraschino cherries
soaked in cherry brandy. I highly rec-

the stems of the cherries into knots

disconcerting, but took it pretty well.

came up with all of them in about four
seconds (almost enough time to buy a
tree) and were even able to sing all of
them. That’s some useless knowledge
coming into play. I was pretty pleased,
but I then realized that these were clearly
some brain cells that needed to die. I ate
some more cherries.

Has anyone else ever wondered what
Santa would do if the coals in the
fireplace were too hot when he came
down the chimney? I used to worry
about that a lot and confided my fear in
my family. We decided to one day tell
our little children that Santa dropped
an elf down the chimney before taking
the plunge himself. It’s like testing the
griddle with drops of water when you’re
making pancakes; if they dance, it’s
hot. I can’t wait to give my kids night-
mares with that little tidbit.

Ah, Christmas Day. Childlike de-
light gave way to laziness-—Mom, The
Boy and I slept until almost eleven.
Still, the gifts were worth waiting for.
Mom got the white television she
wanted, to match the white kitchen.
The Boy got a box of instant oatmeal.
I got a pair of gray sweat pants...what’s
wrong with this picture? Of course we
were all anxious to get to our stocking
stuffers. When I was about ten my
mother stopped giving me cool stuff
like stickers and started giving me oven
cleaner and prune juice. How
amusing...actually it has been since we
started getting back at her for that. One
year on Christmas Eve I found myself
in Walgreen’s buying J heri curl, a ro-
mance novel, a Mallo Cup, and a pack-
age of condoms. The cashier looked at
me funny and I just smiled at her,
looked her in the eye, and said, “Stock- '
ing stuffers.”

I look forward to Christmas dinner
every year. Who wants something dull
like turkey, ham, or roast beef when
you can have a nice succulent meatloaf?
I LOVE meatloaf. And we make it
special for the holidays. It’s shaped
like a Christmas tree (which of course
doesn’t take long to make, since speed
is optimal when Christmas trees are
involved) and is decorated with red and
green peppers shaped like ornaments
and a cheese angel. Finally, the tree is
gaily festooned with garlands
of ketchup.

Shaving cream. Selling clothes.
Alcohol soaked cherries. Gray sweats.
Condoms. Meatloaf. What more could

New prescription plan unfair to providers and employees

T6 the editor:

I would like to address the W&L
faculty and staff:

Recently, the administration of
Washington and Lee University imple-
mented a new employee prescription
plan. This plan affects the health and
well-being (both physical and eco-
nomic) of over 800+ people and their
families.

In my capacity as pharmacist/owner
of Bierer’s Pharmacy in Lexington, I
have had the privilege of serving many

of you over the last twenty years. I
have always set fair prices and gone the
extra mile to help you through your
medical emergencies and to answer
your health care questions.

Our relationship has been based
upon mutual trust and respect. But
now our relationship is in
serious jeopardy.

As a result of the prescription plan
change, I am compelled to withdraw
from participating in the MAINTE-
NANCE portion of the plan. I was
given no choice. I was asked to accept

a pricing plan where I would either lose
money or, unbelievably, charge too
much — OR drop out of participating
in the plan. As a consequence, you no
longer have the freedom to choose
Bierer’s Pharmacy for your long—term
prescriptions. We both lose!

As an independent pharmacy owner,
I have neither the ability or desire to
compete in the pharmaceutical “price
war” now underway across our nation.

It is this “war” which I feel has
precipitated this prescription plan
change. It is an ominous trend, riddled

with cost shifting and predatory pric-
ing schedules. As a result, I am voicing
my concerns, and hoping that you
will too.

Normally, unless your physician
says you require the use of a particular
brand name, the generic is the best buy.
As a result, generics have become very
popular with budget conscious indi-
viduals. I encourage all of my patients
to consider their use
whenever possible.

If I were to participate in the main-
tenance portion of this new prescrip-

tion plan and you wanted the generic, I
would be asked to overcharge you! If
you wanted the brand name (which is
true about half the time), I would be
guaranteed to lose money!

How can this new plan be consid-
ered reasonable or equitable? It isn’t.
Not to you or to me. Any health care
plan which unfairly shifts the burden of
cost to one particular provider by dic-
tating low fees is a ﬂawed plan. Any
health care plan which asks you, the
employee, to share the cost of the policy
premium but denies you the choice of

x

your provider is a ﬂawed plan. Let
your employer know that there has to
be a better way to do business here in
Rockbridge County. A spirit of fair
play should prevail — not the bottom
line of an impersonal manufacturer or
a detached consultant who does not
live or work here.

I thank you for your kind attention,
and welcome the opportunity to an-
swer any of your questions.

The past week has been a ban-
ner week for the men’s basket-
ball team. The Generals posted
three straight wins over Roanoke,
Mary Washington, and
Lynchburg, improving to 6-5
overall (3-3 in the ODAC) and
providing plenty of ﬁreworks and
hope for Generals’ fans along the
way.

It began Saturday night in the
Warner Center as the Generals
faced defending ODAC cham-
pion Roanoke, and things looked
grim early as Roanoke began the
game with a 1 1-2 burst.

But the Generals responded
with seven unanswered and then
took the lead for good with 6:39
left in the first half, 28-26, off a
jumper from junior Derek Carter,
who led the Generals with 22
points and 12 rebounds. The Gen-
erals never looked back, closing
the half with a 11-4 run for their
43-34 halftime lead and scoring
the ﬁnal 11 points of the game to

post the 85-65 victory. Junior
Jon Coffman added 16 points,
and Mark Oonnelly contributed a
14 point, 11 rebound effort.

Senior Tyler Duvall also tal-
lied 10 points and nine assists in
the win.

Next up was a non-confer-
ence game against Mary Wash-
ington Monday, a game which
few looked to as a milestone. Yet
after 45 minutes of basketball,
six school and two NCAA Divi-
sion lll records had been tied or
broken, leaving the arena shell-

shocked.

The 126-121 OT win set the
W&L record for most points

BASKETBALL, SWIMMING, WRESTLING, INDOOR TRACK

Men’s basketball reels off three straight; goes over .500

given up and tied the record for
most points scored, reaching a
single-game total last equalled in
1954.

The 51 points in OT broke the
NCAA Division III record for
most points in OT by both teams,
and W&L set the single-team
record with an astonishing 28 of
those points in the ﬁve minute
extra frame.

Both Mary Washington-’s 18
three-pointers and the W&L’s 52
free-throw attempts set school
records, and junior Jon Coffman
set a school record with 22 free-
throw attempts, sinking 18 to tie
yet another mark.

MWC jumped out to an early
9-4 lead and held it for most of
the ﬁrst half, until a three from
sophomore Matt Clark put the
Generals ahead 36-34 after a MW
time-out, leading toa 52-45 W&L
lead at halftime.

MWC tightened the game in
the second half, pulling ahead
91-88 with 1:55 left after a 13-5
run. But Clark banked in a three
and added a foul shot for a rare
four-point play to give the Gen-
erals a 92-91 lead. Things looked
grim as the Eagles of MWC ral-
lied for a 98-95 lead with just 14
seconds left, but freshman Jimmy
Schweer saved the day with 0:04
left on a long-distance connec-
tion that sent the game into OT at
98-98.

The first half of OT remained
tight, but the Generals reeled off
a 10-0 run to go ahead 116-107
with 1:10 to play. Mary Wash-
ington closed to a three-point
deﬁcit with 0:21 to go, but clutch
5-6 foul shooting clinched the
five-point triumph, part of the

Generals’ astounding 19-23 from
the foul line in OT.

Coach Verne Canﬁeld dis-
missed the excitement after the
game, saying, “I’m not interested
in setting records trying to
outscore people. It’s a win and
l’ll take it, but I thought the
Roanoke game was a much bet-
ter all-around team effort.”

When asked if there was ever
a time that he just sat back and
shook his head at the scene,
Canﬁeld explained the danger of
such a wild affair,

“You can get mesmerized by
a game like that where a team is
shooting so many 3-point shots.
It begins to affect your defense,
and that’s what I was concerned
with.”

The Generals finished the
week with a 82-75 victory over
ODAC rival Lynchburg, behind
20 points from Jon Coffman.

Lynchburg led 37-35 at the
half and took a 51-42 lead almost
midway through the second half,
but W&L’s defense stepped up
to hold the Hornets scoreless for
more than seven minutes, and
junior Cam Dyer provided the
late offensive punch, scoring nine
of his 16 points in the ﬁnal ﬁve
minutes, leading an 8-0 Gener-
als’ run that put the game away.

Looking ahead, the Generals
travel to Randolph-Macon on
Sunday. Coach Canﬁeld cited a
continuing need to refocus the
defense but struck an optimistic
chord, saying, “The guys are do-
ing some of the little things that
every coach likes —- playing to-
gether, making the extra pass,
playing hard. We’re making some
inroads in those intangibles that
we’ve needed in the past. It’s
difﬁcult for the every-day fan to
see, but it’s going to pay off for
us down the road.”

Lady Generals fall to
Guilford; beat Hollins

By KEITH GRANT
Phi Staff Writer

The Washington & Lee
women’s basketball team began
a four game homestand with a
tough loss against Bridgewater
College at the Warner Center.

The Eagles prevailed 57-53
in an Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference game that was not de-
cided until the ﬁnal minute of
play.

The Generals fall to 4-7 over-
all with the loss, 3-5 in the ODAC.
The defeat came on the heals of a
win at Hollins that snapped a
W&L three game losing streak.

Junior co-captain Sandra
Holmes had a strong game with
16 points and 11 rebounds while
shooting 8-12 from the ﬁeld.

The Generals as a whole shot
only 38 percent for the game,
failing to overcome a second half
28 percent shooting effort by the
Eagles.

Despite a narrow three point
lead at intermission, Bridgewater
(6-5, 5-2 ODAC) established a
42-34 advantage six minutes into
the second half when Cindy
Pearson (16 points) drained a
three-pointer. It was the Eagles

biggest margin of the contest.

Following a W&L timeout,
the Generals used four different
players to score, tying the game
at 42 with less than eight minutes
to play.

The teams exchanged baskets
until Sandra Holmes scored from
underneath for a W&L 48-46
edge. Unfortunately, it would be
W&L’s final lead of the game.

In the last 90 seconds of play,
Jennifer Hedrick netted a score
and Bridgewater converted two
free throws to take a 55-52 lead
en route to the victory.

The win was the 465th career
win for Eagle head coach Laura
Mapp, the nation’s second
winningest active coach.

The Generals never-die atti-
tude was evident throughout the
game. In the first half, W&L
trailed at times by four, ﬁve and
seven, yet always answered with

a run to pull back into the game.

Down 31-24 with 38 seconds
left until halftime, junior co-cap-
tain Allison Hull and freshman
Tonia Dean scored to pull the
Generals within three at the
buzzer.

Dean had nine points and a
game-high eleven rebounds. Se-
nior Amy Mihal recorded ten

including a 20 point upset victory.over arch-
rtime win versus Mary Washington, the

points and six boards before foul-
ing out, while junior Stacy Will-
iams netted eights and pulled down
nine rebounds.

Freshman Rachel Read upped
her assist total to 30, two behind
team-leader Hull.

Foul shooting was a problem
for the Generals as they went to
the line only eleven times, mak-
ing three. Bridgewater converted
13-of-17, including ten in the ﬁrst
half.

W&L had ended a three game
losing skid with a 52-38 win at
Hollins Tuesday night.

Holmes led the team with 13
points and 11 rebounds, moving
her into fourth place in the ODAC
in rebounding. Dean had a good
night with eight points, eight
boards, and two blocks.

Another freshman, Michelle
Hicks, had nine points and ﬁve
rebounds in the win at Hollins.

The Generals shot just 33 per-
cent for the game, but doubled
Hollins’ free throw total by mak-
ing 14-of-26.

W&L will host ODAC oppo-
nents Lynchburg, Virginia
Wesleyan and Randolph-Macon
over the next week. The
Lynchburg game is Saturday at
2:00 in the Warner Center.

Swimmers win easily

By Soorr BOOKWALTER
Phi Staff Writer

If there was any rustiness after not swimming
competitively for more than a month, the Wash-
ington and Lee women’s swimming squad gave
little indication of it as they trounced Buffalo
State, 111-52, on Wednesday evening at Cy
Twombly Memorial Pool.

The Generals upped their season record to a
perfect 4-0 with the.triumph.

W&L shattered three meet records during the
course of the night. Junior Rebekah Prince smashed
the mark for the 200 meter backstroke with a time
of 2:19.29. Freshman Megan Wiedmaier estab-
lished a new record in the 200 meter butterﬂy with
a 2:30.54. Senior Susan Fisher also got into the act
by crafting a new standard in the 200 meter IM
with her time of 2:29.20.

“They were good meet records,” coach Kiki
Jacobs remarked. “We swam better than we did at
this meet last year.”

The match got off to an inauspicious start for
the Generals as Buffalo State’s Jody Carnrike
burned her way to a new meet record in the very
ﬁrst event, the 50 meter freestyle, ﬁnishing with a
mark of 26.48. Camrike also captured the next
event, the 100 meter freestyle, in a time of 58.83.

However, it was all W&L after that as the

4 Generals placed ﬁrst in six of the next seven

events. Sophomore Jen Miller started W&L on the
comeback trail with a triumph in the 200 meter
freestyle with a log of 2:07.71. Sophomore Anne
Spencer sped to a 5:50.55 in her victory in the 500
meter freestyle, and Wiedmaier captured her ﬁrst of
two wins in the 1000 meter freestyle with her time
of 11:43.15.

With the momentum having clearly swung to the

Generals, the records began tumbling down. Prince

entered her name into the record books in the 200
meter backstroke.

Wiedmaier proved she was just as solid in the
sprints as she was in the longer races with her record
in the 200 meter butterﬂy, and Fisher blew away the
competition en route to her mark in the 200 meter
IM.

The Generals also established a team record in
the ﬁnal event, the 200 meter medley relay, with a
time of 2:01.52/

Jacobs was extremely pleased with the Generals’
effort.

“The team was tired from returning from break
and going through rush,” she said, “but we swam
real well.”

W&Lfaces a home meet on Saturday with Catho-
lie, a team which edged the General’s last year by
only seven points. However, the Generals will be
lacking the services of senior Brandi Henderson,
who Jacobs said would be “sorely missed.”

“The match will be real tough,” Jacobs said. ‘‘I
think we can swim well, but it will be tight.”

1995 FD won’t have fireworks

Committee plans special surprise instead to coordinate with later ball

By PETER WEISSMAN
Phi Staff Writer

This year’s Fancy Dress Ball will please night
owls, disappoint fireworks fans, and surprise
everyone.

The ball will be held 30 minutes later than usual,
from 9:30-1:30 am, instead of from 9 -1 am. It will
conclude with a surprise event instead of the tradi-
tional ﬁreworks display.

Students had mixed reactions to the changes.

“I like the hour changes because I always felt that
12 o’clock made fora short night,” junior Robin King
said. “I’ll miss the ﬁreworks. I’m a little skeptical
about what they’re going to come up with [instead].”

“No one gets to the ball until 10:30 anyway,” said
Senior Frost Bush.

“You’re going to see more people in advanced
stages of drunkenness because of the late hours,”
sophomore Christina Petrides said.

FD Steering Committee chairman Joe Framptom
said that the 40 members of FD subcommittees
decided on the changes for several reasons. For one,
students tend to arrive at the ball late.

“It’s a shame for [FD] to do all that work, and
people only see it for two hours,” Framptom said.

“We’ve decided to start it up at 9:30pm to give
everyone achance to enjoy a nice dinner, and [we’ve]
extended the hours later for those who don’t arrive
until later,” said FD Auditor Kathy Boozer.

The City of Lexington would not allow ﬁreworks
at 1:30 am, the ball’s new ending time, Boozer said.
She said that fireworks are expensive at more
than $3300.

Framptom said that few students see the ﬁreworks
and that those who do are scattered around campus.

“We’re going to try to do something this year that
kind of brings everybody together a little more,”
Framptom said. “The band is going to end, and we’re
going to do the deed. [lt’s] going to be a bigger deal
than the ﬁreworks because it’s going to be right in
[the gym].”

The 88th Annual Fancy Dress Ball will be held
March 3. The Bo Thorpe Orchestra will perform in
the Warner Center, and another band will play in
Doremus Gym. The second group, whose contract is
in the mail, will be “a very danceable band that plays
music the students will like,” Framptom said.

“It’s not a country band,” Boozer said. “People
will be excited about that.”

The bands and decorations will make for a suc-
cessful event, Framptom said.

“The committee has worked hard for what I think
is going to be a spectacular ball,” he said.

As auditor, Boozer has her own expectations.
Last year’s ball ﬁnished $2000 in the red because bad

weather weakened ticket sales, she said.

“We plan on not having a [ﬁnancial] loss, and we
look forward to strong support from the student body
through ticket purchases,” Boozer said.

Tentative prices for couples are $45 for a ticket
and $75 for a memorabilia package of two t-shirts,
posters, shot glasses, a new item, and 4 cups, she said.

University Historian Taylor Sanders said that
there have been ﬁreworks at virtually every FD since
he came to W&L in 1969. They were not part of the
ball in 1992 because of budgetary constraints.

Although last year’s ﬁreworks may have ended a
tradition, many students, including Yabiz Sedghi
and Frost Bush, did not see them.

“They were having the ﬁreworks while the band
was still playing, which was not a bright idea,”

I

Sedghi said.

“If the event they have planned measures up,
maybe it will be an even better treat,” Bush said.

Sophomore Cathy Merritt said that changing FD
will not alter its effect on students.

“Whatever they do, people are still going to have
fun at Fancy Dress,” Merritt said.

Another person happy with the change: Lexing-
ton City Manager Jon Ellestad, who approved last
year’s ﬁreworks request. He said they were set off
after 1 am, later than the request had indicated.

“I think it’s too much of an imposition on every-
one who’s sleeping.”

How does he feel about a surprise event instead?

“Oh boy. That word ‘surprise’ worries me. You
guys have inventive minds.”

B&G to take
over fraternity
house cleaning

By DAN ODENWALD
Phi Staff Writer

Washington and Lee Buildings and _
Grounds will not renew its contract”

Wm‘ St°“°W3“Maﬂagementsewicesfi‘ regularly ﬁnes fraternities for dam-

the fraternity house cleaning service.
The decision was made earlier this

year primarily for ﬁnancial reasons,

according to Calvin Elswick, Director

' of Buildings and Grounds. Elswick’s

staff decided the business arrangement
was no longer cost effective for the
University.

University Treasurer Lawrence
Broomall would not disclose the amount
of money that will be saved. However,
he did say that the unused funds would
help pay for Fraternity Renaissance.
Currently, the cost of Fraternity Re-
naissance is distributed among each
male belonging to a Greek organiza-
tion in the form of Greek dues. Despite
the release of the cleaning service, Greek
dues will not be reduced.

Another motivation was the dissat-
isfaction with the work being done in
some fraternity houses, although
Elswick pointed out that the work in
others was adequate. Also, hiring out
independent companies to clean the
fraternity houses did_n’t mesh with
Elswick’s personal philosophy. . He
believes that Buildings and Grounds
should be responsible for cleaning the
houses themselves.

The announcement has caused an
uproar in certain segments of the W&L
community, especially from some fra-
ternity members.

Fraternity house residents are upset
to see some Stonewall employees leave.

Sigma Phi Epsilon Treasurer Matt
Mazzucchi said, “Our cleaning lady
does a good job and works hard. The
brothers in the house have developed a
good rapport with her.”

Currently, Stonewall cleaning per-
sonnel spend four hours in each house.
Fraternity members are concemedabout
the problems B&G might have due to
the lack of manpower.

Mazzucchi said, “We are worried
that B&G might not spend enough time
cleaning. Also we’ve heard that B&G
workers will spend only two hours per
day cleaning the house.”

Elswick has said he is “studying”
hiring more B&G personnel.

Not all members of fraternities are
apprehensive about the upcoming
switch.

Lambda Chi Alpha President Bob
Ferris said, “As long as the house gets
cleaned, we have no problems with
who does it.”

Another cause of concern is wage
compensation for the B&G employees.
Elswick said that there will be no pay
increase for the added responsibilities.

B&G workers are well compensated

j bers was the issue of ﬁnes.

for the work they do, according to
Elswick. He added their wages were
similar to the national average for all
cleaning personnel.

Another concern for fraternity mem-
B&G

ages and failure to clean after parties.
Occasionally, fraternity residents ne-
glect to sufﬁciently clean their party
rooms. Often, the cleaning ladies will
clean before B&G crews arrive and
assess ﬁnes. Some fraternity members
believe ﬁneswillskyrocketwhen B&G
takes over the cleaning. _

Mazzucchi said, “We avoid ﬁnes
by staying in touch with our cleaning
lady and working closely with her.
With B&G, you’ll see a lot more ﬁnes.”

Jeffrey Laborde, the President of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, agreed.

“We’ve had a problem with B&G
ﬁning us in the past,” Laborde said. He
was concerned with the possibility that
excessive ﬁning would once again
present a problem.

Elswick readily agrees that prob-
lems will be encountered in working
out the new arrangement.

“Transporting the crews to the Era-
ternity houses presents a problem,”
said Elswick.

Additionally,formulatingschedules
and determining the cleaning needs of
each fraternity house also present chal-
lenges for B&G.

Despite these obstacles, Elswick is
confident that B&G will perform well.

“You will see a difference in our
service level. We want to maintain the
quality level of service that students
are used to,” said Elswick.

Director of Stonewall Management
Services Billy Hall was disappointed
with the decision, but was not angry.

“The decision was purely economic.
W&L said it had nothing to do with our
performance or our price,” said Hall.

Hall also said the decision will not
affect community relations with W&L.
In fact, he hopes to have an opportu-
nity to work with the University again.

Hall also pointed out the six ladies
who currently clean the houses will not
lose their jobs when the contract with
W&L expires. He intends to offer
them positions elsewhere.

Fraternity house mothers generally
agree they will regret to see their clean-
ing ladies leave, but they have no prob-
lems with B&G.

Kappa Sigma house mother Brame
Spessard said, “We feel sorry for the
ladies who will lose their jobs.”

Despite concerns that B&G will not
perfonn up to par, Elswick is conﬁdent
that they will come through.

“We are excited about taking on the
new responsibilities and will support
the fraternities at quality level,”
Elswick.

can also help women prevent
osteoporosis.

The activities W&L students par-
ticipate in vary greatly, from those
who have daily aerobic work-outs, to
those who take P.E., to those who
participate in intercollegiate and club
athletics. Weights, intramural aerobics,
and pick-up basketball seem to be
among the most popular activities, ac-
cording to Colliton.

Senior Carrie Brown, who works
out for an hour a day, six days a week,
says “I’d like to think I work out the
same as [other students], but I always
see the same people...” Many other
students, however, seem to think that
they lag behind their peers in the ﬁt-
ness game. Because many students
don ’t like others to know they exercise,
it is difﬁcult for one to compare his or
her own fitness program to that

of others.

The reasons students exercise are as
varied as the exercises they enjoy. For
some, it is appearance. Colliton says,
“At this point, [students exercise] to
look good. There are a lot of tight-
dress forrnals out there.” Another sig-
niﬁcant motivation for exercise is the
feeling of achievement it can produce.
This is especially true of exercises such
as weight-training, where a person can
actually track his or her progress. In
addition, many students find that exer-
cising is a great method of relaxation.
To some, exercise is just something
they enjoy.

There are many facilities available
to W&L students interested in working
out, both on and off campus. Fitness
options offered on campus include the
Gaines Hall exercise room, which has

‘ four exercise bikes, three stair climb-

ers, free weights, a rowing machine,
Nautilus equipment, and a cross-coun-
try ski machine. Doremus Gymna-
sium also offers a plethora of ﬁtness
options. The weight room offers free
weights, weight machines, and three
exercise bikes. There are also twelve
racquetball/squash courts, two gymna-
siums, and two pools.

There is some criticism of the re-
sources available on campus. Senior
Lisa Florentine, who has her own step-
per at home, says that there are not

enough exercise facilities provided by
the school. Brown agrees, saying,
“There aren’t enough facilities for the
number of people who [work out]. For
the cost of the school, we should have
a larger facility.” Brown admits, how-
ever, that “it’s improved since we got
the stair climbers.” Many students
agree with Colliton who says,“ltwould
always be nice to have more room,
[but] for the size of the school, and
being Division III, it’s pretty good.”
She admits, however, that the weight
room does get crowded. While cer-
tainly more facilities could be useful,
most students agree there’s not a big
problem most times of the day. The
exercise facilities seem to be most
crowded around 10:00 a.m. and 4:00
p.m.

For those who ﬁnd the on-campus
facilities inadequate to their needs,
Lexington has two health clubs. The
Lexington Fitness Center has been serv-
ing the Lexington community for the
past ﬁve years. About twenty percent
of the members of Lexington Fitness
are W&L students. Ray Cohen, owner
of the center, says that the benefits of
their Lexington Fitness come from the
philosophy of their family—owned and
operated club, which is to serve and be
a part of the Lexington community.
Many of their programs are geared for’
beginners, and the staff discourages

competitive mentalities. “We see our
job as helping [people] improve their
lives...if you choose to become a mem-
ber, we pride ourselves on excellent
service,” says Cohen. Rates for mem-
bership at the Lexington Fitness Cen-
ter range from $30 to $40 per month,
depending on the length of member-
ship, but many special discounts are
available. Anyone interested in these
discounts may call for information.
Omega Fitness Center has joined
Lexington’s ﬁtness scene since the new
year. According to manager and trainer
Amy Puyear, Omega’s staff is “conﬁ-
dent that we have great equipment and
a great facility.” According to Puyear,
Omega has already received a great
deal of student interest. One student
said she wanted to join because she
couldn’t work out when she wanted on
campus. The enrollment fee is waived
for all W&L students, and a free screen-
ing by the staff doctor is offered with
every enrollment. Memberships start
at approximately $35 per month.
Winter can put a damper on an out-
door ﬁtness program. However, win-
ter can also be a great time to try a new
activity. Some options are running on
the track in the gym, inter murals, and
sports equipment which can be checked
out from the gym. There are also some
great exercises that are available only
in the winter, including cross—country

PAGE§

skiing Anyone interested in cross-coun-
try skiing should contact the Outing
Club for information. W&L also of-
fers several winter club sports. These
are men’s’ and women’s’ fencing,
men’s’ ice hockey, men’s’ racquetball,
men’s’ and women’s’ downhill skiing,
men’s’ squash, and men’s’ volleyball.
Club sports director Joe Lyles is also
looking for women interested in form-
ing women’s racquetball and squash
teams. Any students interested in any
of the club sports should contact Lyles
for information.

Colliton offers special advice for
specific ﬁtness goals. For those inter-
ested in weight loss, she says that low
to moderate exercise, coupled with a
balanced diet, is the best solution. For
those who want to maintain theirweight
and increase muscle tone, Colliton rec-
om mends aerobic exercise and strength
training to add tone and firmness. To
liven up a dull work out, cross-training
is the best remedy. “Adding another
exercise to your program or bringing a
friend along can help keep you from
losing interest,” Colliton advises. For
those who would like to start working
out, or who would like to get back to
working out, Colliton recommends
starting slowly.. Colliton urges those
who have never worked out before to
see a physician for a check-up
before starting.

Legends of the Fall — itirﬁ

Legends of the Fall is a most unusual type
of movie, a sort of tale of masculine emotion, in
the tradition of Lawrence of/irabia.

It fearlessly treads on very dangerous ground,
trying to probe the male psyche without scaring
men away by being “touchy-feely.”

The story opens on a Montana farm at the
turn of the century. Anthony Hopkins portrays
Col. William Ludlow, who has raised his three
sons far from the cares of the world, and also far
from his separated wife.

The eldest son is the responsible one, Alfred
(Aidan Quinn), followed by the long-haired
rebel, Tristan (Brad Pitt), and the young vision-
ary, Samuel (Henry Thomas, of E.T. fame).

Samuel returns from Harvard with a beauti-
ful young ﬁancee, Susanna Fincannon (new-
comer Julia Ormond); she immediately be-
comes an object of desire for Samuel’s brothers
as well.

But Samuel has brought back from the East
more than a ﬁancée; he also has all the news of
the war in Europe and a youth’s desire to
crusade for a good cause.

So, against his father’s wishes, he goes over-
seas to ﬁght the Germans, pulling along his two
brothers with him.

He is shot to death right before Tristan’s
eyes.

After being discharged, Alfred asks Susanna
to marry him, and she very reluctantly agrees;
however, when Tristan returns home, he se-
duces her, then proceeds to leave Montana,
roaming the world, in search of adventure and
‘himself.’

After many years, he writes that their love is
dead and she should stop waiting for his return;
so, she returns to almost-cuckolded Alfred, and
they marry.

Alfred continues to rise in the business
community, and eventually becomes a Con-
gressman.

When Tristan ﬁnally returns home, he mar-
ries the young daughter of the farrnhand, settles
down and raises a family, maintaining the farm
by running liquor across the border of Canada.

This runs him afoul of the local mob, who
proceed to kill his new bride (albeit acciden-
tally).

There follows a few rounds of vindictive
killings on both sides, and a great deal of soul-
searching by everyone. In the midst of it all,
Susanna commits suicide.

Finally, the enfeebled Col. William Ludlow
and the distant Alfred come together to save

the male psgche

Tristan from the mob, thereby reuniting the rent
family.

What really stands out in this ﬁlm is the T
excellent character development by all the lead-

ing actors.

Brad Pitt does a marvelous job of keeping
Tristan very human, not allowing him to be-
come a stereotypical rebel relishing in his ma-
chismo. _  j p _ ,

With similar depth Julia Onnond and Aidan
Quinn present all the subtlety that “boring”
people are full of.

Strangely enough, considering his stature as
an actor, Anthony Hopkins has the most difﬁ-
cult time.

In part this is because his character suffers
a stroke which paralyzes part of his face and
body, but it is so fake that he looks laughable
instead of fatherly for a large part of the movie.

The directing from Edward Zwick is decent,
despite occasional, severe lapses into melo-
drama. He wisely utilizes the amazing Montana
landscape whenever possible.

Certainly the ﬁlm’s greatest weakness must
be the plot, which is tedious, winding, and
slightly aimless; then again - not to get too
philosophical or anything — that is what life is
really like, after all. Because of this we focus
more on the characters and their interactions
than we do the events in their lives.

The total effect of the ﬁlm is to leave us
slightly saddened,'but asking all sorts of ques-
tions about our nature. Considering that W&L
is a bastion of the Establishment will make the
tension between the surviving sons very inter-
esting and relevant.

On the one hand is Alfred, who is a paragon
of duty and conformity but also of pent-up
resentment. Opposing him is the wild, uncon-
trollable, irresistible Tristan, a sort of Marlon
Brando meets the Marlboro Man meets Ernest
Hemingway.

The conﬂict between the two is handled well
in its own right, but made even more interesting
by the memory of young Samuel and the future
of young Samuel’s wife-to-be Susanna.

The movie seems to come down on the side
of Tristan’s virility, independence, and other
Nietzscheanqualities. Though Alfred has the
money and the power of government, it is
Tristan who has the affections of the ﬁlm’s
women and takes life for all he can get. After
much wandering, Tristan is still able to re-
discover his home, stability and family.

At any rate, it will be a troubling movie for
C-School majors and others ready to jump on
the fast-track to peaceful, afﬂuent anonymity,
and an uplifting movie for the free spirits and
beatniks who populate Payne and Newcomb.

Legends of the Fall has excellent acting in
all the main roles and is ﬁlmed warmly and
solidly, reminiscent of Chariots of Fire.

Despite the melodrama, it is a grand, sweep-
ing, meandering ﬁlm which will not satisfy a
thirst for action or adventure, but might make
you wonder why you’ve got that thirst. (Still,
what is the meaning of the title?)

Ggmnasl Lagman balances past and future dreams

By RACHELLE Rows
Phi Staff Writer

Did you know that a major competitor and
star of the United States Gymnastics Federa-
tion goes to our school? With her modesty, you
probably didn't.

' Sophomore Holly Layman, a mix of ambi-
tion and friendliness, started gymnastics at age
SIX.

Layman’s best friend, a gymnast since age
three, sparked her interest. After noticing the
strength and flexibility layman had attained at
such an early age, her sister suggested it might
be a good sport for her.

At age eight, layman was competing in
and winning competitions at the thirteen and
older age level.

At age nine, Layman and her parents faced
a difﬁcult decision. She was asked to move

Olympic gymnast Bart Connor.

Nine-year-old Holly Layman gets a hug from

away from her home to live with coaches and
other elite gymnasts to train for the Olympics.
At such an early age, Layman was too young to
understand the implications of this decision.

Her father knew about the inescapable un-
happiness so many young athletes are faced
with after having their childhood taken away
from them at such an early age. Many never
recover to lead a normal life.

Layman ’s fatherthought it best for his daugh-
ter to live as normal a childhood as possible.
Although she feels this was the right decision,
she still will always wonder what life might
have been like had she chosen that path.

Layman won an abundance of awards com-
peting. She won her individual events, she won
the all-arounds, and she not only competed in
the compulsory division but also the optional.
Most gymnasts usually compete in one or the
other because two 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. days in a
row is too tiring. She did both and still won.

In high school Layman continued to com-
pete with her USGA team for at least ﬁve hours
a day, practiced and competed for her high
school team, played for the ten-
nis team and excelled in ad-
vanced placement classes at her
public high school.

Layman got home at 10 p.m.
and did her homework before her
early morning practices. Sleep
was not a priority or much less an
option. Layman says this sleep
deprivation preparedher for col-
lege. Talking with Holly Lay-
man would give the President an
inferiority complex.

Amazingly, Layman gave up
gymnastics last year when she
came to W&L. She gave it up to
become a doctor, another dream
of hers.

Most importantly, Layman is
happy. That’s not to say she
doesn’t miss gymnastics. Last
year was the ﬁrst time in her life,
since age ﬁve, that she didn’t
spend at least ﬁve hours a day
with gymnastics.

If you’re interested, you might
try and sneak a peek in Howe

does front handsprings as well.

Layman admits it was tough at times last 2
year. However, thewords“fear,”“I’m scared” 1
and ‘‘I can’t’’ are not allowed in a gymnast’s 1
vocabulary. It is a very common trait among 1
gymnasts to be perfectionists,'and Layman is. 
Every minute of her life is mapped ‘out with a 3
purpose and, at the same time, she manages to g

be down-to-earth.

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

ﬂ .
 When alcohol becomes a problem...

, "  The Ring-tum Phi has never been a particularly voluble

{opponent of alcohol. We recognize that, hey, students at
Washington and Lee drink. A lot. We have even been known

1 I to be somewhat proud of the fact.
‘ Most students at W&L can attest to drunken incidents which
: they would rather they (and their friends) forget, and the Phi
staff is certainly not immune to this malady.
Very few colleges, even those who miss the Princeton

V

Review alcohol ratings altogether, can boast that they are free
of alcohol misuse.

But there comes a time when one must seriously re-evaluate
one’s opinion of alcohol use and abuse. During a visit to view
the police arrest docket recently, some members of The Ring-

. #1 tum Phi happened on the name of one of their fellow students.

Unfortunately, we realize that it is not unusual to ﬁnd
students’ names listed next to charges of “Drunk in Public” or
“Minor in Possession” or even “Driving Under the Inﬂuence.”
All of these seem to surface during “big” weekends, late at
night, and we generally ignore these unless they involve close
friends-—and we laugh about it.

But someone caught our attention this week, and we won’t
use the name because we have no desire to drag a W&L
student’s name through the mud. This student was arrested for
* DUI at 7:45 p.m. on a Monday. Alone, this would be disturb-

ing.
But we already knew of another incident in which this

I g ‘ student had been involved, which was simply too sensational-

ist and damaging to blazon across the top of the front page of
the Phi. We turned back the pages to a few weeks before,
where the same person had been arrested at 9:20 a.m. on a
Thursday for the same offense.
Once, it was disturbing. Twice, it indicates a serious prob-
lem. The frightening part is, this is the one who was caught in
"‘ . the act—we all know people who have managed to suffer from
alcoholic problems undetected and unbooked.
We can only hope that, when someone is arrested for an
x alcohol-related offense, that person will take a close look at his
or her patterns of alcohol use and recognize that they may have
a problem. In this case, it obviously did not happen.

If anyone is reading this, and knows someone to whom
similar behavior is common, please try to find a way to help
them.

We have no desire to ban alcohol; we can even understand
that drunkenness can sometimes be a way to relieve the
pressures of academia. But please, don’t let it be taken this far.

Artichokes inspire zealous living

MELISSA SAWYER,
’97

I ate artichoke hearts out of the can

the other night, and they were not“as"s“*

good as the real thing — the ones you
take apart piece by piece until you get
to the center. There is something in the
act of taking the bud apart that makes
the eating of an artichoke far more
interesting than eating bits of sterile,
canned vegetables with a shelf-life
longer than my eighteen years. Like-
wise, I think that it would be far more
interesting to cross the Yukon in a dog
sled or to sail the Atlantic in a twenty-
foot skipper, than to grab the next USAir
ﬂight from Roanoke. I learn many
things from my little daily adventures,
just as I learn patience in the face of
anticipation while eating an artichoke
heart. My physical trials, though cer-
tainly not as fearful as a solo voyage
across the ocean, have taught me en-
durance and independence. How then
in a world of canned artichokes and
Boeing 747s — in a world of biweekly
fraternity parties and pre-paid dining
hall meals — can we learn how to
survive? We learn because we are hu-
man; the little pieces of our days add up

in our minds. We study Adam Smith so
that we know why Tide costs more
than Brand X at Walmart; likewise, we
study our feelings when our friends
forget to call, so that we know what it
is like to be lonely.
So often stu- .

dents are told that 
‘college is not the “
real world, that
we have it easy in
everything that
we do, and that
our successes are
simply handed to
us on our silver

beginning of June , so will we plan for
retirement in our mid-sixties.

We will all follow the syllabi of our
lives just like we follow our daily plan-
ners here at W&L. The ever-critical
onlooker might suggest that there are
too many vari-
ables in the real
world with which
we have no expe-
rience with here.

Perhaps it is naive to think that man

immune to the accidents of daily life,
even if they may be somewhat con-
densed and simplified, like my arti-
choke hearts. Their flavor is there
where a close friend is rushed to the
hospital for alcohol poisoning, or we
are invited to be part of an honor soci-
ety; when we go through rush only to

be denied a bid at our ﬁrst choice or
when we find that we cannot afford
groceries for the rest of the month
because tuition went up; when we find
ourselves lying face down in the gutter
because the bottle was a little to big,
and the night a little too short. .

For some students more than oth-
ers, W&L is the real world. There is a
surprising subculture here of people
who are alien to the ease of college.
These are the people who eat the arti-
choke apart leaf by leaf until they get to
the center. These are the people who
work part-time jobs to pay for their
books,orwearwhite high-heelsinJanu-
ary because they do not own bone
colored ones; these are the people who
have suffered emotions and
made friends who are not afraid to
share a bathroom.

Maybe we are stronger than we think
when we graduate from W&L. Out
experience here is perhaps just the con-
densed version, the easy-access canned
artichoke.

We already know how to set goals
and how to reach them. We know how
to cry and laugh and love;we know
how to win and to lose. Someday, as
the cynics say, when the real thing hits
us full force in the head, we will al-
ready know what the artichoke tastes
like, and we will just have to work at
getting to its heart.

Lee Chapel no place for sex

To the editor:

I wanted to point out an upcoming event which
disturbs me. On January 26, Suzi Landolphi will
deliver a commentary entitled “Hot, Sexy, and
Safer”. I am not disturbed ‘about the topic, but the
location of its delivery. I do not think that I am
alone in this, but it seems to me that there is
something wrong about holding a presentation of

No qualifier
needed for
‘Generals’

To the editor:

In the January 13, 1995, issue of the
Phi a headline at the top of the sports
page referred to the “Men’s basket-
ball” team,while a headline farther
down on the page referred to the “Lady
Generals” basketball team. There are
no “Lady Generals”. There are no
“Gentleman Generals”. All of W&L’s
teams are just plain “Generals”. Keep-
ing the teams straight without calling
them by an inaccurate name will make
it harder for your staff when it comes to
crafting headlines, but anything else
wouldn’t be right.

this nature in LEE CHAPEL. There is a dignity and
an aura to Lee Chapel that invites such speakers as
William F. Buckley Jr., and enables us to hold
such serious forums as open trials or Honor

system orientations.

Joining, as the publicity says, “America’s most
outrageous SEXpert in a frank and funny celebra-
tion of great sex — with audience participation ”
(emphasis added) debases such dignity. I feel that

Ms. Landolphi ’s presentation ought to be moved to a more

The W&L men’s swim team avenged last season’s
loss to Catholic with a 113-92 victory.

David Stillman and Nathan Hottle led the Generals in
the contest.

Stillman turned in record performances in both the 50

the 200 IM and 200 breast.

The win, coming off a 132-54 pounding of Buffalo
State provides the Generals with momentum going into

and Johns Hopkins in Chapel Hill.

In wins over Buffalo State and Catholic, she set two

record time. Against Catholic, she followed up her
amazing perforrnanc b winning the 500 free and setting

After completing a successful
three-game homestand last week,
the W&L men’s basketball team
ran into stiffer resistance on the.
road this week, dropping the ﬁrst
two games of their road trip to
Randolph-Macon and Emory &
Henry.

On Sunday, the Generals lost
a tough 74-59 decision at
Randolph-Macon.

Poor shooting on all fronts
plagued the Generals, as they shot
only 37% from the ﬁeld, includ-
ing 5-22 from three-point range,

and hit only two of seven from
the foul line.

Junior Cam Dyer, the Gener-
als’ season scoring leader, led
the way with 15 points and eight
rebounds.

Senior Mark Connelly con-
tributed 10 points and ﬁve re-
bounds, and Derek Carter and
Chris Couzen recorded eight
points each.

Wednesday took the Gener-
als to face the Emory and Henry
Wasps. Poor shooting hurt the
Generals again in the ﬁrst half,
leading to a 52-44 halftime deﬁ-
cit.

The Wasps threatened to put
the game away by scoring the

ﬁrst six points of the second half,
but the Generals came roaring
back with a 20-5 run to take a one
point lead with a little over 13
minutes to play.

A pair of threes for Emory &
Henry opened it up again, but the
Generals made one more run to
cut the lead to 89-87 on a Jon
Coffman 3-pointer with 2:15 to
play.

However, the Wasps re-
sponded with six straight points
from Shannon Scott in the final
1:30 to clinch the 96-89 win.

Coffman posted a team-high
24 points, including seven 3-
pointers, tying a W&L school
record.

Hobbled by injuries, Washington & Lee’s
women’s basketball team dropped its fourth game
in a row Thursday night in the Warner Center.

The 67-49 defeat to Randolph-Macon was the
Generals’ tenth loss in 14 games this season and
leaves them 3-9 in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference.

W&L played its second straight game without
injured freshman Rachel Read, limiting the squad
to just seven players.

The Generals trailed by eleven at the intermis-
sion due to six-of-20 shooting. They also turned
the ball over 17 times in the half while being
outrebounded 24-16.

The Yellow-Jackets (10-3, 8-2 ODAC) took
advantage of W&L’s problems with scoring runs
of seven and nine to lead by as many as 13.

Freshman Tonia Dean kept the Generals in the
ball game with six ﬁrst-half points on 3-4 shooting.
Junior Sandra Holmes, who has been bothered by
a sore ankle, was held to four points and four
rebounds. However, a Holmes bucket with two
seconds left in the half kept W&L hopes alive
going into the ﬁnal 20 minutes.

After a Randolph-Macon three-pointer by Jenn
Kohler (19 points) opened up a 14 point Yellow-
Jacket lead, Dean sparked a 10-4 run with a tum-
around shot in the lane and a put-back of an
offensive rebound.

With six points in the W&L run, Dean helped

and some tough losses have dampened the mood for the Generals.

close the gap to 32-24 ﬁve minutes into the second
half.

Kohler, though, nailed another three-point shot
to spoil the run. W&L never got closer than nine
and trailed by as many as 18 in the ﬁnal six minutes.
Even a tape of the “W&L Swing” was eaten up
during the Yellow-Jacket onslaught.

Kohler tallied 15 second—half points for R-MC,
including three three-pointers. Sandy Krispin to-
taled 12 points, six boards, and six steals.

For the Generals, Dean had 12 points and ten
rebounds, Holmes added eight points and nine
boards, and senior Amy Mihal tallied seven_ of
each. Freshman Michelle Hicks hit three-of-six
shots and totaled nine points in 21 minutes of work.

Reduced to seven players, W&L head coach
Terri Dadio used everyone for at least 19 minutes.
Only fourof the 12 Yellow-Jackets who entered the
game stayed on for that long.

Tuesday night, the Generals dropped a tight
contest to Virginia Wesleyan, 64-59. Down 60-47
in the ﬁnal minutes, Washington & Lee went on a
14-4 run but did not have enough time left to get
closer.

Dean had a huge game against the Marlins,
wracking up 14 points and 15 rebounds. Holmes
came off the bench, shook off the sore ankle, and
scored 17 on 6-for-11 shooting. She and Dean are
now tied for the team’s rebounding lead (8.0).

The Generals are on the road for their next two
games, beginning at Guilford on Saturday. Tues-
day, the team travels to Eastern Mennonite for
another ODAC game before returning to the Warner
Center, where they are 1-7, next Thursday to host
Randolph-Macon Women’s College.

ning today at Catholic.

Head Coach Verne Canﬁeld
continued to emphasize the need
for improved team defense, hold-
ing one all-defensive practice.

“We’re going to keep work-
ing at it,” he stated. “My philoso-
phy is you’re not supposed to

together, because when you have
weaknesses on offense, you need
to make up for it on defense.”

Overall, he praised the team’s
work ethic, saying, ‘‘I am very
pleased with their effort. They
can’t play any harder. Play more
consistently? Yes, but not
harder.”

He cited the many difﬁculties
players face at W&L, from rigor-
ous academics to lack of peer
approval to a condensed sched-
ule due to winter break and ex-
ams.

unique. The academics, the hours

it’s tough for any student-ath-
lete. This is tough on these guys
and you have to be careful that
fatigue doesn’t build up, because
once it does, it rears up and bites
you hard.”

When asked about motivation,
Canﬁeld declared, “We take pride
in the fact that we really prepare
these guys, but it still has to come
from within. You can get used to
winning, and you can get used to
not winning, and you have to be
careful of that last one. It’s tough
to motivate when you’re losing,
but the kids really care. We really
work over there, and these little
things are going to pay off down

Quadrangular rough for W&L

By ERIC SWENSEN
Phi Staff Writer

Last Saturday at Doremus
Gym, the Generals had a rough
time in the W & L Quadrangular
meet, losing to three talented
teams in Davidson, Pensacola
Christian and York.

Whilethe Generalsstruggled
as a team, some individual wres-
tlers turned in excellent perfor-
mances.

In their opening contest of
the day, the Generals were de-
feated by Davidson 25-16.

Rob de Clerk took an 8-4
decision in the 142 lb. class , and
Robert Hull (Heavyweight) and
Colin Looney (177 lb. class)
picked up the other Generals
victories.

Next, the Generals faced

Pensacola Christian and came up
a little short, losing 33-24. Hull
earned respect as he was the only
one of four Generals wrestlers to
pick up his victory in this match
on the mat.

He dominated his match from
the beginning, and was well ahead
on points when he recorded a pin
at 6:09.

In their ﬁnal contest of the
day, the Generals faced a very
tough York team and came out
on the losing end of a 47-0 deci-
sion.

A bright spot for the Generals
was in the heavyweight class, as
Hull battled to the end against a
qualiﬁer for the national touma-
ment, but eventually dropped an
11-5 decision.

Hull’s excellent early season
performance is even more im-
pressive considering he has not

wrestled competitively in two
years.

While he was a state cham-
pion as a heavyweight his senior
year in high school, he chose to
play lacrosse his ﬁrst two years
here at W & L.

Coach Gary Franke is pleased
with Hull’s early season perfor-
mance, but notes that Hull can
improve further. “Hull is still
making fundamental mistakes,
but that is true of ourwhole team.

About the meet, Franke said,
“Overall, we were a little disap-
pointed with the meet. We’re a
little disappointed with the
middle weights.” Franke noted,
however, that “They are working
hard to improve.”

This Saturday, beginning at
9:30 a.m., the Generals will host
the W & L Invitational at the
Warner Center.

The Generals exacted a measure of revenge for a close loss last year as they
defeated Catholic 109-96 on Saturday. With the win, the team improves to 5-0
on the year. The Generals travel to Chapel Hill this weekend for a tough tri

meet against Johns Hopkins and Emory University.

Swimmers topple Catholic

By Soorr BOOKWALTER
Phi Staff Writer

The Washington and Lee
women’s swimming team sent a
tough Catholic squad packinglast
Saturday by hanging on for a
109-96 triumph at Cy Twombly
Memorial Pool.

The victory enabled the Gen-
erals to remain perfect with a 5-
0 overall mark.

Coach Kiki Jacobs was ex-
tremely pleased with the result.

“It was a big win for us,” she
commented.“Itwas the ﬁrst meet
that we knew would be tough.”

Freshman Megan Wiedmaier
dominated the meet by triumph-
ing in two individual races, in
one of which she established a
new meet record. She also as-
sisted the relay team in carving
out another meet record.

Unlike the previous meet with
Buffalo State, the Generals shot
out to a hot start against Catholic,

winning the ﬁrst four races.

Sophomore Laura Marshall
got things rolling with a victory
in the 50 yard freestyle with a
time of 26.59.

Sophomore Jen Miller fol-
lowed that up with a conquest in
the 100-yard freestyle by ﬁnish-
ing in 58.41 seconds.

Wiedmaier then took center
stage as she swept both the 200
and 500 yard freestyle. Her meet
record was established in the 200-
free with a log of 2:04.75, and
she finished the 500-free in
5:29.35.

The Catholic women rared
back to post victories in ﬁve of
the ﬁnal seven events, but it
wasn’t enough to overtake the
Generals.

Junior Rebekah Prince was a
key factor in holding off Catho-
lic as she broke a meet record in
the 200-back with a time of
2:21.12.

Also, W&L picked up crucial
points by placing second, third,

and fourth in both the 1000-free
and 200-breast.

The team of Wiedmaier,
Miller, Marshall, and senior Stacy
Coﬁeld smashed the meet record
in the 400 yard freestyle relay
with a mark of 3:55.29.

“Overall, we swam pretty
well,” Jacobs remarked. “A lot
of people contributed.”

A meet at Mary Baldwin
scheduled for this past Tuesday
was postponed due to illness on
the Mary Baldwin side. The meet
was rescheduled for Wednesday,
January 25.

Next on the agenda for the
Generals is a road trip to the
University of North Carolina on
Saturday foran imposing tri-meet
with Emory and Johns Hopkins,
who were both top 20 ﬁnishers at
the 1994 NCAA Division III
Championships.

‘‘It will be a real tough meet
for us,” Jacobs stated. “We’re
just going down there to swim
well.”

new hazing policy
for W&L Greeks

The IFC will continue to exercise its power if any

As to whether any complaints have actually been

comment.

At last Tuesday's IFC meeting, Batteh reminded
fraternity representatives of the university’s new
hazing policy.

Batteh especially underscored an excerpt from
the policy reading that, in the view of W&L faculty,
any form of hazing “violates individual dignity.”

“All such transgressions,” the policy concludes,
“will continue to be prosecuted vigorously.”

ODK taps 32 at
Convocation

BY Mrcrurzr. I-Ir-zwu-:1'r
PHI STAFF WRITER

 

When he learned that Alabama was last in public
school education, William E. Smith ’63 said he was
shaken from his comfort zone and compelled to do
something about it.

Smith spoke Thursday in Lee Chapel on “The
Origins of Leadership: A Liberal Arts Perspective”
during the Founders’ Day/Omicron Delta Kappa
convocation. He talked about how a liberal arts
education can provide the foundation for leader-
ship. A Washington and Lee graduate, Smith is
chairman and CEO of Royal Cup, Inc.

Smith became involved with Leadership Out of
Bounds where he started studying public education.
At the time Alabama ranked in the middle of south-
eastern states. In 1990, the states that had trailed
Alabama were now ahead.

“We had more portable classrooms than in any
state,” he said.

Many schools didn’t have any foreign languages
offered in the curriculum, and in some high schools,
the most advanced math was called general math,
he said. Two-thirds of food stamp recipients and
prisoners were high school dropouts.

To correct the problem, Smith founded a
grassroots organization called A+. The organiza-
tion has over 12,000 corporate and individual mem-
bers. He said they traveled across the oountry to ﬁnd
working programs and to reform education in Ala-
bama.

He credits his education at W&L for providing
him with the tools for leadership. He said W&L led
him to discover what is right and wrong. He said his
interaction with James Leybum and other great men
changed his life.

Smith lived with Leyburn for two years as an
undergraduate. He said Leybum expanded his mind.

“I can still hear in my mind’s ear the notes of his
music coming into my room,” he said.

He said these experiences created an atmosphere
for leadership to ﬂourish.

“It’s been my opinion that a liberal arts education
is the source of social leadership,” he said.

Smith said, in recent years, there have been too
many poor leaders and too few good leaders.

He cited two types of leadership: transactional
and transformational. He said transactional leader-
ship concerns itself with the management and effi-
ciency of an organization. A transformational leader
unites separate interests to pursue higher goals and
seeks justice, liberty and equality, he said.

Smith believes a liberal arts education shapes
this perspective and provides moral literacy. He
said it engenders a tolerance of diversity and starts
a conversation that continues for a lifetime.

He cited Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and Leyburn
as examples of good leadership.

“We do not do our world any favors if we do not
know who they are or for what they stand,” he said.

In the ODK initiation which followed, 28 stu-
dents and four honorary initates were tapped. The
honorary initiates were Dr. Jane Horton, Captain
Robert Peniston, Frederick Schaeffer ’64 and Wil-
liam Smith, Jr. ’63. The students were Khristopher
Ahrend, Jeff Chapuran, John Earnhardt, Barbara
Jane League, Elizabeth Misiaveg, Randal Noe, all
law students; seniors Chris Albert, Kelly Brotzman,
Elise Brown, Alan Christensen, Mark Crider, Alex
Cross, Robert Eison, Jennifer Hickes, Marina Jack-
son, Ashley Kauffman, Timothy Kinsey, Noelle
Parrott, Julia Podlas, Beth Provanzana, Duane Van
Arsdale and Jonathan van Dyke; and juniors Justin

propriety of having the presentation in Lee Chapel.

I “It’s totally disrespectful to Robert E. Lee,” said sophomore Hunter Armstrong. ,,
“Up until a few years ago, men weren't allowed in the chapel without a coat and tie,
and women in dress. Now they’re letting some skanky masturbation lady come and
speak.”

Student Activities Director Michelle Richardson said Landolphi is speak ing in
Lee Chapel because it is the only available facility.

“The Lenfest Centerwas our ﬁrst choice,” said Richardson, “but it’s not available
because they’re preparing for She Stoops to Conquer. The only other choices, such
as the Black Box Theater, are too small for a speaker of this nature.

“I understand the concern people have with this. Captain Peniston is going to
close the door and put up a divider to separate the crypt from the speaker.”

“Hopefully people will not be too offended,” said Richardson. “She’s pretty I‘
blunt, but it’s necessary information.”

After the presentation there will be a reception in Fairfax Lounge where
Landolphi’s book and pamphlets will be available.

 Kemp to speak at Mock
Convention Spring Kick-Off

BY MICHAEL HEWLEIT
Phi Staff Writer

Possible Republican presidential candidate Jack
Kemp will speak on Tuesday, April 25 in front of Lee
Chapel.

“The real group responsible for bringing Kemp is
Contact, “ said Mock Convention Chairman David
Stewart, “because of their generosity of their decision
to co-sponsor this with us.”

Amidst growing concerns from Executive Com-

mittee members over Contact’s inability to bring ~

speakers, the committee voted Wednesday, Jan. 18 to
contribute $15,000 to the Mock Convention to bring
Jack Kemp for the Spring kick-off.

Contact president Andrew Schneider and repre-
sentative Jim Pike voted against the proposal.

Mock Convention tried to get Kemp before but he
declined because of money, said Contact Vice-Chair
and Mock Convention Speakers Chair Jason Bearden.

In an EC meeting two weeks ago, student president
Kevin Webb and Vice-president Alex Cross said
Contact had failed to bring enough prominent speak-
ers to the campus. At Monday night’s EC meeting,
Webb said Contact should look into whatever oppor-
tunities are out there to bring good speakers.

Schneider wanted Contact to bring a speaker on
their own to prove to the EC that the Committee is
doing their job.

Mock Con chairman and Contact member Bob
Ross disagreed.

“We have to be concerned with what’s best for the
university,” he said.

Contact representative Trey Copeland said getting
a good speaker for the Spring kick-off was essential
for a successful Mock Convention.

“Mock Convention is a big deal,” he said. “If the
kick-off doesn’t go off, it will make it harder to get
other good speakers.”

Catherine Bassett said Mock Convention will prob-
ably not get a big speaker like Kemp without Contact’s
support. '

Junior Andrew Olmen said with Contact’s sup-
port, Mock Convention will be able to raise more
money from other organizations.

“The Hill will recognize that other groups will
want speakers,” he said, “ and if they don’t give us
money, they’re will be less funds available.”

Schneider said Monday that Contact is no more
behind than previous committees.

“I’ve been on two other committees,” he said, “and
I know how fast and how slow things move.”

Jason Bearden said Contact needs to spend the
money on a big speaker. ,

a better way.”

Darrell said he would buy food at
14 cents a pound from a food bank in
Verona and distribute it to local food
pantries. Because the food bank has a
limited inventory, Darrell said, he
would make monthly trips to Verona
to buy the food. He may also buy food
from W&L suppliers.

Va. area code to change

BY KATHRYN MAYURNIK
Phi Staff Writer

As of July 15, 1995, the area code for
Lexington and surrounding regions will
change from 703 to 540.

Presently, the 703 area code also shared
by Fairfax, Arlington, and Prince William
counties, as well as western Virginia. Af-
ter the switch in July, Fairfax, Arlington,
and Prince William counties will keep the
703 code.

The switch is a manifestation of the
growing need for phone numbers. The
increased use of fax machines, cellular
phones, pagers, computers, and Identi Ring
has created a general shortage of phone
numbers in general, and a new area code

seems to be the answer.

“The growing number of local ex-
tensions such as the 570 extension prove
the growing need for phone numbers,”
commented Dana Camper of the Wash-
ington and Lee Telecommunications of-
ﬁce.

However, not informing your par-
ents of the new code isn't an instanta-
neous solution for avoiding their phone
calls.

The phone company will allow a
grace period of a year in which the 540
and the 703 area code will put the call
through. This “Great Schism” of the
area code will be in effect mainly to give
people enough time to change their busi-
ness cards.

Student leaders, faculty discuss alcohol

BY MICHAEL HEWLETT
Phi Staff Writer

Over a dinner that featured iced tea, 60 well-dressed Washington and Lee
student leaders and faculty members agreed that W&L does have an alcohol
problem, but they disagreed about how to solve it.

Most students thought education would be the best policy, but University
psychologist James Worth said afterward that education is not enough.

“Education is necessary but not sufficient,” he said. “I think we will never have
a change until student self-govemance takes the position that truly dangerous
levels of alcohol consumption should be discouraged on this campus.”

Selected student leaders and faculty attended the dinner sponsored by the
Student Health Committee on Sunday in the University Center. Reporters were
allowed to attend on the condition that they did not directly quote anything said in

the discussion.

“An education program that continues into the fratemity and sorority pledgeships
would be valuable,” said sophomore Executive Committee representative Amy

Gorham afterward.

Junior Kim Gartrell thought alcohol abuse was part of a deeper porblem. She
said some of the reasons given for alcohol use during the dinner dealt with students

feeling uncomfortable not drinking.

“For somebody to feel unaccepted unless they drink says something about they

feel about as a person,” she said.

Worth agreed. He said too many students do not feel free to abstain from alcohol
or to drink at healthier levels. He said students feel pressured to drink to ﬁt into the

W&L social scene.

“My perception is that the campus needs more freedom——not less—in regards
to alcohol consumption,” he said.

Junior Thomas Keman thinks stricter enforcement of Virginia state law that
prohibits underage drinking would help.

“I like the idea of not serving [alcohol to] people under 21,” he said. “It is
certainly not going to be an absolute, but it’s going to help.”

He said stricter enforcement would reduce the availability of alcohol and
provide an economic check. He said if more people had to pay to consume alcohol,
then they would buy less of it.

Keman said more alternative social functions like the acoustic coffeehouses
student activities director Michelle Richardson has organized would help. He said
a student center where students could socialize without the pressures to drink
would reduce alcohol abuse on campus.

Worth also pointed to the lack of social options and the scarcity of role models
for alternative ways of behaving. He said students must free themselves of the
notion that in order to have fun, they must drink.

“We say that our tradition is work hard and play hard,” he said. “The truth is
that we work hard and drink hard here. Hard drinking is risky drinking.”

Dean of the College John Elrod said there needs to be a clearer understanding
of what kind of drinking problem the school has. The issue of alcohol consumption
should extend to the entire student body, said Elrod.

.“I think that one of the most effective thing we can do is to get lots of students
to go through the exercise we went through [Sunday] night,” he said.

Kernan agreed.
“I think [the dinner] is a good beginning,” he said, “but the process needs to be
continued because the problem is not going to be solved by a bunch of student
leaders sitting around and discussing it.”

‘Flesh-eating’ disease strikesRockbridge

From Phi staff reports

Eight cases of a dangerous strain of strep have been
reported in the Shenandoah valley.

The group A streptococcal infection has killed ﬁve
people and hospitalized three in the past six weeks.
Three cases occured in Augusta County, two in
Rockbridge County, one in Rockingham county, and
one from the city of Lexington

Phyllis Parker, wife of W&L professor David
Parker checked into Stonewall Jackson Hospital on
December 31.

“After realizing the severity of her condition, the
doctors here transferred her to the hospital at the
University of Virginia,” said Donna St. Clair, director
of Commmunity Relations at Stonewall Jackson Hos-
pital.

Mrs. Parker has recovered and returned home
Thursday.

“Everyone is delighted to have her back here,” said
her husband. “We’re a family again. She’s home.
That’s a big, big step in the right direction.”

Normally an area the size of the Shenandoah

Valley would average nine cases in 12 months. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates
that 10,000 to 15,000 severe infections occur every
year in the United States, causing 2000 to 3000 deaths
a year.

Most Group A Streptococci bacteria are found in
the throat and on the skin. GAS usually results in the
non-lethal strep throat.

Other life-threatening infections caused by GAS
include septicimia, or infection of the blood, cellulitis,
or infection in and underthe skin, necrotizing fasciitis,
or destruction of fat and muscle, and sometimes
streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. These lethal
forms are called “invasive GAS.”

Cases of the disease have risen over the past
ten years.

Strep infections are usually treated with antibiot-
ics. Some forms of invective GAS are resistant to
antibiotics. In these cases, surgery is sometimes
needed.

infective GAS can occur in people with open
wounds or an underlying disease. The disease is
spreadthrough direct contact with infected people or
those who carry the virus. People can carry the virus
without even knowing it.

There is no vaccine to protect against the
disease. For prevention, people with wounds
should keep them clean, and watch for signs of
pain, swelling, or discoloration around the
wound.

The disease can also be spread through dis-
charge from the nose and throat, and by con-
taminated blood, so family members of those
infected should be particularly careful.

Spread of the disease can be reduced by
frequently washing hands, particularly after
coughing or sneezing, and before preparing
food.

GAS became infamous this summer when
“the British tabloids started calling it ‘the flesh-
eating disease,”’ according to Assistant State
Epidemiologist Suzanne Jenkins. “There was
an outbreak of it in Britain, and the media
created the hype.”

Everyone should be careful of their health,
said St. Clair, but the disease should not cause
a panic.

“It’s a cause for concern,” she said, “not a
cause for alarm.” '

President Jean-Bertrand Aristide’s government is increasingly con-
cerned that the United States is pulling its troops out too fast with
inadequate preparation for the imminent turnover to a United Nations
peacekeeping force. About 6,000 troops of the original 20,000 remain in
Haiti. By March 31, the number will drop to 3,000 and the U.S. troops will
make up half of the U.N. forces that will remain in Haiti through Feb. 1996.

A U.S. Air Force ofﬁcer and his 10-year-old son were rescued in the
mountains of northeastern Turkey. They had been missing for nine days
and disappeared on a ski outing. They took shelter in a cave and ate snow.
Forest rangers reunited them near the town of Bolu in western Turkey,
about 18 miles northeast of the ski resort where they disappeared Jan. 15.

Cable 2 plans new shows  

BY PETE WEISSMAN
Phi Staff Writer

Unlike the dark, casual coffeehouses
in which they usually play, Brian Boland
and Tommy Esposito sat in the bright
studio of Cable 2 to tape a new televi-
sion show.

“I certainly had the willies,” Esposito
said. “There were two giant cameras
staring at you. You gotta block every-
thing else out and focus on the music
and what you’re saying in the songs.”

“Cable 2 Unplugged,” a new student
production, marks a different direction
for Boland and Esposito and for the
station that created the show. The mu-
sic program premiered in Northen Au-
ditorium on Jan. 21 at 7pm and will
aired on Cable 2 Jan. 23 at 8pm.

Like MTV’s show, the student pro-
gram features acoustic performances in
an informal setting. The group played
originals on the show in addition to
covers of Peter Gabriel and Dave
Matthews. Boland and Esposito also
commented on their songs in segments
that were ﬁlmed outside. Chris Albert,
Frank Olah and Catherine Gartin di-
rected the program.

“It’s a neat way for the people who
are in a band to get some exposure,”
Gartin said. And “for us to get some
experience.”

Since Boland and Esposito met last
Spring, the pair have played at Harbs,
The Raven and Crown, and W&L’s
acoustic coffeehouse.

“I think they have a lot of talent, and
they’re very entertaining,” said
Michelle Richardson, the Student Ac-
tivities Coordinator who has booked
the group for the GHQ.

Their music draws on blues roots,
and their repertoire of original songs is
growing. Unlike the Pearl Jam they
cover, their music does not have social
messages. “ W e ’ r e
not pissed about stuff,” Esposito said.
“We’re just trying to have a good time.”

The increased exposure has not
weakened Esposito’s modesty.
“There’s not a big ego problem in our
group,” Esposito said. “I’m always so
nervous, and [Brian’s] always laid
back.” '

For Cable 2, the production is a
break from its “Rockbridge Report”
and “Dating Game” shows.

“It’s very freestyle and directing it
you get very creative,” Olah said.

For the show, they used a new stu-
dio design and lighting scheme, Olah
said. The set featured stools, pedestals
wrapped in red and blue velvet, and
candles. Albert said it took 10 to ﬁf-
teen hours to prepare the studio. Gartin
said that each song requires about an
hour of editing. They also used ﬁve
cameras instead of the usual two and

employed new camera techniques. But
Albert admits, “the equipment certainly
is not what MTV uses.”

“They’d never done anything like
this and neither had we, so it was a
learning experience for everyone in-
volved,” Albert said.

Esposito agreed.

“When we do a show like this again,
we’ll know what to expect and how to
prepare for it,” Esposito said.

The station plans to introduce other
new shows including “W&L Genes,”
a public affairs show that proﬁles W&L
personalities, “The Hills House of
Style,” “Saturday Afternoon Beer
Party,” and monthly interviews with
the Executive Committee.

“These are all student productions,”
Albert said. “A lot of schools don’t do
stuff like this.”

Boland and Esposito are evolving
quickly. Since the show, they have
changed some of their original songs.
The two have formed a somewhat
louder band with Pat White and hope to
perform at fraternity houses. The pair
will play at the Raven and Crown on
Jan. 27th.

Olah, a junior, said he would like to
produce “Cable 2 Unplugged” in the
future when seniors Albert and Gartin
graduate.

“I think it’s interesting to see
the talent that’s out there and going to
school right next to you,” Olah said.

Landolphi urges sexual responsibilty

BY MICHAEL Hswuzrr
Phi Staff Writer

“Why don’t we have a group safer sex experience?”

That’s how Suzi Landolphi opened up her “Hot, Sexy and Safer” program
Thursday night at Letitia Pate Evans Dining Hall. Landolphi, author of Hot, Sexy
and Safer, is a nationally known speaker who has taken her one-woman show to
high schools and colleges around the country. She has appeared on talk shows
such as “Donahue,” “Rolonda” and many others. .

Originally, she was scheduled to speak in Lee Chapel. Some students criticized
her speaking there because they thought the topic of her presentation was
inappropriate for Lee Chapel. ~

The speech was sponsored by Panhelenic, Contact, the AIDS Education
Project, the Health Education Committee and the Interfratemity Council.

Talking to a roomful of students, she deﬁned two things: safe sex and safer sex.
Safe sex is when someone has a sexual experiencewith himself (masturbation).

“You cannot give yourself anything but a smile,” she said. Safe sex gives
people the right to like themselves, she told the audience.

Safer sex is when a person has a sexual experience with another human being
and both people are drug and alcohol free, she said.

She said people have been misled by the alcohol industry to believe that alcohol
loosens them up or eliminates their inhibitions. Actually, alcohol simply turns off
the part of the brain that prevents people from engaging in risky behavior, she said.
Landolphi said alcohol makes it easier to risk one’s reputation, dignity and life.

Most bad sexual experiences and rapes occur while people are under the
inﬂuence of alcohol.

But the biggest problem in this country, said Landolphi, is the inability of
people to talk honestly about sex.

“When we talk about sex in this country, we talk around it,” she said.

Women are brought up to not love their private pans while men can be proud
of theirs.

“We bring up half our population to believe they don ’t own their private parts,”
she said.

Women and men need to know they are of equal value, she said. She said what
is needed is not a change in behavior but a change in attitudes. Women grow up
not knowing how their bodies work and are sent out into the world to hook up with
some man, she said.

Young men and women grow up without learning how to properly use a
condom. She said a condom is not 100 percent effective, but it can offer better
protection if used correctly. For example, a man should pull out before orgasm
during intercourse, she said. She demonstrated condom use with a male volun-
teer. The student unrolled the condom, stretching it to show its strenth. A female
student came up and put the condom on his head. Holding his nose, Landolphi,
said sex does not equal intercourse. She said a woman’s orgasm resides in the
c1itoris—not the vagina. Once people realize this, the whole idea of sex is
redeﬁned, she said. She said they realize that people can have an orgasm without
removing their clothes.

In fact, her ﬁrst sexual experience occured when she was 15. It happened in
gym class when she climbed a rope and had an orgasm. She didn’t have,
intercourse until she was 21.

She emphasized that sex does not have to mean intercourse.

“It angers me that we use only one word for sex,” she said.

Sex can be a step process to intercourse, she said. She said the process helps
build a sexual foundation and can make a person feel comfortable with his
sexuality. Landolphi said a woman should not feel obligated to have intercourse
with a man if he gets an erection.

“I’m responsible for my own orgasm,” she said.

The 44-year-old praised the younger generation as one of the best in this
century while warning them that they will face the problems her generation failed
to solve.

“You’ve got to get rid of all the things our generation told you they would get
rid of and copped out,” she said.

She said she doesn’t want this generation to make the same mistakes hers
made.

“I’ll be damned if I allow to let what happened to my generation happen to
another one.”

Higher
Learning

Flaps

By KIRK SUSONG
Phi Movie Reviewer

 

Higher Learning — ikrﬁr

John Singleton’s first ﬁlm, the excellent
Boyz ’n’ the Hood, was about the travails of a
young black man growing up in Dos Angeles.
With his latest, Higher Learning, he hopes to
expand his scope to bigger, more broadly rel-
evant issues.

He chooses as his microcosm the fictional
Columbus University, a large, respectable, West
Coast college, perhaps patterned after Stanford
or Berkeley.

At the beginning of the term we meet three
young freshman, Kristin (Kristy Swanson),
Malik (Omar Epps), and Remy (Michael
Rapaport). All three are having difficulty adapt-
ing to the pressures of college life.

Kristy is cute, naive and a bit dazed by
everything. She gets drunk and is ‘date-raped’
by a lecherous fraternity man. (Curiously
enough, it’s not that she minds having sex with
him —just having sex without a condom.) As a
result she ﬂees to the lesbian embrace of the
campus feminists’ group.

Malik is on a partial track scholarship and
has trouble balancing his running with all the
work expected of him by his professors. How-
ever, he gets a beautiful female runner to teach
hi in about comma splices, run-ons, and so forth.
All the while, he must fight the oppressive
forces of racism all around him.

Remy is a geeky engineering student from
Idaho. His roommate, played with delightful
malice by Ice Cube, is a huge, offensive and
inconsiderate sixth-year senior who smokes a

lot of marijuana. Angered by this black man,
Remy quickly becomes caught up in the

‘ skinheads on campus.

I After various encounters between the differ-

~ ent characters, the racial tension explodes in a

horrible climax, as Remy shoots at people at-
tending a peace festival, and eventually kills
himself and Malik’s girlfriend.

Boyz ’n’ the Hood was such a success that
this film was greatly anticipated. However,
despite the high quality of both its acting and
directing, the movie fails as a result of the sad
script.

John Singleton makes the screen expressive
and keeps the film moving along very well; he
also throws in a few clever camera tricks to
make it seem a bit more interesting and arty
(such as Kristy’s two, simultaneous romantic
encounters).

Thank heavens, he also avoids lingering for
too long on any of the typical set-up scenes we
always see in ﬁlms set at large universities,
such as shots of busy cafeterias or green lawns
filled with hackey-sackers.

The cast is quite large, so it is impressive that
there are such solid performances from most of
the characters. Leading the way is Omar Epps,
who does a great job as the resentful, troubled
Malik Williams. Though he adequately handles
all the emotionally charged scenes, he is also
careful and dignified in his appraoch to the
‘normal,’ calm scenes Malik has.

A nice surprise was the amount of screen
time Laurence Fishbume has as the crusty,
mentoring politics professor, Maurice Phipps.
He again does exceptional work, displaying the
talent and versatility which began as a young
soldier in Apocalypse Now and has recently
seen something of a comeback, as with Ike
Turner in What's Love Got to Do with It. This
is yet another distinguished, poised and tightly
acted role for a great actor.

Some of the actors and actresses tend to let
their characters slip into silliness and carica-
ture, but is that their fault or the fault of this
horrcndously bad script?

Written by John Singleton, this script is full
of absurd stereotypes, empty sentimentality,
and dreadfully predictable plot ‘twists.’

The dialogue is bland and pointless, the
characters are embarrassingly fake, and noth-
ing happens which surprises the audience or
even really gives us pause to think.

There are scary black men, wacko white
men, and cute, peaceful feminists.

The fraternity men are a stereotype as far
frmn the truth as Animal House, but presented
with complete seriousness and objectivity.

The whole movie is fake, and transparently
so at that. It is truly a testimony to the actingthat
this film is bearable.

John Singleton goes to didactic extremes to
ask, “Why can’t we all just get along?” So it’s
Curious that Higher Learning made me appre-
ciate even more the sense of community and
intimacy provided by W&L’s homogeneity .
Whatever the whiners might say about our lack
of diversity, the campus faces few of the prob-
lems that poor, fictional Columbus U. encoun-
ters in this film.

Essentially, Higher Learning is not a very
good movie.

It has fine performances from a number of
actors, but the entire script is so stale and
preaclty that the film becomes difficult to watch
seriously.

()r.-cc again, Laurence Fishbume and Ice
Cube have given John Singleton good charac- '
ters, but in this film he has wasted them.’

Chargers meet 49ers Sunday

The question comes up at this time every
year, just before the biggest Sunday of them all.
It’s decision time.

Just how can one have fun and stay inter-
ested for three-and-a-half hours in what
isinevitably a one-sided, unentertaining blow-
out?

In the ‘NFL’s 75th season, the league (and
sponsors) were undoubtedly hoping for a more
marquee match-up than two west coast teams
that don’t match up.

A Pittsburg-Dallas Super Bowl meeting
would certainly have brought minds back to

. those teams’ glory yearsof the seventies, an era

of both dynasty-building and leagueparity.
Yet, fans are left with no voice in determin-
ing Super Sunday ’s attractions and must decide
how to put up with an eleventh straight NFC
triumph. I’d love to predict something else, but

Let’s face it: all of us want to have
one very special thing. Great sex. As
if that weren’ t complicated enough, in
the modern age, great sex also has to
be safe sex. It might seem impossible
to achieve both, but the book Hot,
Sexy, and Safer by Suzi Landolphi
proves that safe sex can be great sex.

Last night, Landolphi also proved
that she’s an excellent speaker. In this
book, she proves that her honesty and
sense of humor transfer well to print.
Her tone is blunt, frank, and very
funny. Landolphi addresses every
possible aspect of sex and sexuality.

Hot, Sexy, and Safer deals with a
variety of subjects. She discusses
homophobia, masturbation, sexually
transmitted diseases, the proper use of
condoms, and sexism. Landolphi’s
scope is large, but she manages to give
sufficient attention to all of her sub-
jects.

One of the most important issues
that Landolphi tackles is the attitude
that women have toward their own
sexuality. She writes, “We women
need to like our private parts more.
We need to be aware we were brought
up to dislike our own bodies. That we

let others use our private parts before ‘

we do. That we allow sexist beliefs to
govern our sexuality and sense of self
worth...Women won’t make better
choices about sexuality until they be-
lieve they own their own private parts.”
Landolphi explains that when women
consider their bodies to be “beautiful
and unique,” they will recognize that

“we deserve orgasms.” Sex wil be
better for both women and men.
Landolphi’s crusade to destroy the
myth of the vaginal orgasm deserves
the attention of both sexes.

To Suzi Landolphi, safer sex also
means better communication between
sex partners. She emphasizes alterna-
tives to intercourse so that couples will
know each other better. “Two human
beings who give each other physical
pleasure is sex. In my book, sex and
sexual intercourse are not synony-
mous.” According to Landolphi, the
best tum-on is “honesty and trust.”
Sobriety is vital to safe sex—as Hot,
Sexy, and Safer explains, “Four hours
of getting bombed with someone does
not create the basis of an honest, trust-
ing relationship. The only thing you’ll
have in common the next day is a
headache.” Landolphi also emphasizes
all of the possible problems that could
be associated with sexual intercourse,
from “Hair get[ing] pulled or caught
on something, “ to the risk of preg-
nancy or disease. In

treat it?” She then explains what sexual
activities are riskiest and what pre-
cautions should be taken. The proper
use of condoms is explained. The STD
and safe sex chapters could be te-
dious, but Landolphi is never preachyj
She gives the information that is
needed in the simplest way possible.

Maybe you feel like you know all
there is to know about sex. Maybe
you’re in a long-term, monogamous
relationship. Maybe you simply can’t
see yourself sitting down and reading
a book with a title like Hot, Sexy, and
Safer. If this is your attitude, you are
missing out. Who couldn’t stand to
have better sex? Who doesn’t need to
learn more about their sexuality? I
would recommend Suzi Landolphi’s
book to anyone. I read it and I want my
children to read it some day so that
they will have healthy, and, yes, hot,
sexy, and safe attitudes about sex.
Read Suzi Landolphi’s book. You’ll
laugh, you’ll cry, it will change your
life.

short, sex is a very
difficult thing to do
well. It is easier if
done with someone
you care about.
Hot, Sexy, and
Safer includes de-
tailed information
about sexually trans-
mitted diseases. For
each STD,
Landolphi lists
“What is it?” “What
are the symptoms?”
“How do you treat
it?” and what hap-
pens “If you don’t

In many ways, human beings search for

father ﬁgures, whether they are biological or _

heavenly.
John Edgar Wideman searches for his fa-
ther on the backrouds of his past.
Why are fathers so important? What role do
they play in society?
Widemanattcmpts to answer these ques-
tions in his new ‘book, Fatheralong: Medita-

_ tions on Fathers and Sons, Race and Society.

Wideman travels to South Carolina to improve

In his book, Wideman tries to understand his
father’s life and way of thinking. Along the
roads between Philadelphia and South Caro-
lina, he takes the reader into his painful family
history.

In a flashback to his hometown, he remem-
bers how he searched for his father.

“If I sensed I might run into my father, over
there in the disreputable, darker streets of
Homewood, then crossing Hamilton must have
been a way of seeking him.

"Not his person, but all the power and privi-
lege I associated with his person.”

In a larger sense, Wideman writes that all
men are searching for a physical, spiritual, or

Religious people search for their Heavenly
father.

Even authors such as James Baldwin sought
a literary father.

Some African American men seek fathers
like Nelson Mandela, Mao Tse-tung, Ghandi,
and Karl Marx from other continents.

Stylistically, Wideman, like William
Faulkner, uses stream of consciousness to weave
the many voices from his past.

His writing is lyrical and ﬁerce and original.

Never have I read a writer who expressed
his feelings so honestly and intelligently and
powerfully.

“A motherf*"er, ain’t it.

"This Daddy search. booking under every

brick orrock orcoal pile and me signifying such
a search is the very brick—and-rock foundation
of various political philosophies, survival strat-
egies from integration to separation to bum-
baby-bum incineration to self—annihilation and
starting all over again." _

"Maybe the search for fathers is finally only
a trope, a ropa-dope trope containing enough
rope to hang you up terminally, you black
bastard.”

I hungrily read every word, discovering a.

new insight or a vivid image.

I agree with Village Voice writer Nelson
George that Wideman is one of the most excit-
ing, unrecognized writers out there.

Now that l’ve read his book, l’ve discovered
all the fathers that I never knew I had.

6 Carry only enough cash to last the day.
Anyone who tries to borrow your last ﬁve spot

6 Label your spare-change jar “beetle farm.”
Then, put your beetle farm in a jar labeled
“spare change.”

6 Mark up every space on checks.
Don't leave room for someone to ﬁll in their
name and extra zeros.

6 Keep your wallet in your front pocket.
lt discourages pickpockets. So does wearing
really tight pants.

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

Think about impacts of  
Winter Rush

Last night, the IFC conducted an open forum between fraternity
members and facultymembers to address the problems surrounding
the fraternity rush process.

Each side presented its point of view and arguments for the system
it thought was the least evil. The faculty, some of whom have been
at W&L for twenty-plus years, enlightened the students as to the
history of changes that the rush process has undergone over the years.
As a student and fraternity member, this was helpful because it
revealed the reasons some things were tried and were scrapped and
perhaps why the faculty is concerned at all with the fraternity rush
system (and why they are interfering in our student autonomy).

There were a number of reasons the faculty members gave as
reasons for change, whether to winter rush or pre-school rush or just
something else.

As one might expect, their primary concern was their students’
academics and the fact that we should not have to compete too much
with rush. They obviously want what is best for the academic life of
every student (on both sides of the rush process): freshman, sopho-
more, junior and senior. But many of their reasons ended in similarity
at that. It seemed as though each member of the faculty had a different
anecdote pointing to a fault with the rush system or the IFC’s
handling of its autonomy. With each story of a troubled freshman
year experience or sophomores in grade trouble because of rush
commitments, the problem seemed to have its root in that the
student’s fraternity came before his academics. Additional factors
seemed to include historically ineffective guidance of freshmen
during their transitional fall term and basically too much “necessary”
partying when students should be studying or, at least, not hurting
themselves.

From this standpoint, winter rush loses and a shorter pre-fall term
rush would solve the problem.

Other aspects then came into the equation of rush, which compli-
cated the discussion a little. The strongest argument for a winter rush
— better bonding among the freshmen — is a valid concern.
However, it was brought up that the freshmen do not splinter into
fraternity groups until they are split physically when they become
sophomores.

This reasoning, however, is outweighed by the starker reality that
if winter rush was implemented, it would last all fall term whether
contact rules are enforced or not. Perhaps in a perfect world, where
all alumni gave money and all W&L students had 4.0 GPAs, winter
rush could work, but sadly, the reality cannot physically support this
type of system.

In support of winter rush, a large part of the argument is the
comparison of fraternity winter rush systems at other schools (and
even the sorority rush system here) to W&'L’s, which is largely like
comparing apples to oranges (with the exception maybe of Hampden-
Sydney).

The other schools do not have a Greek system which is the
principle social activity, and since freshmen do not have false
identification to go to the Palms, etc. as with other larger universities,
they will want some social outlet (way to drink), which is the perfect
dirty rush tool.

What we should look at is improving communication between the
freshmen and the IFC and the hill (including spelling out in big letters
that pledgeship is deferred until winter term and that they should
study)! in their free time during rush — not get behind and catch up
later .

This year’s rush probably worked better than any of the three
different rushes of which I have been a part. It was short and to the
point. Besides that, it interfered as little as possible with school as
most of the final week of rush was closed contact, and the week
previous to that was the ﬁrst week of classes and principally closed
contact. Ideally the party/open contact aspect of rush should be out
of the way as quickly as possible while there are no conﬂicting
academics.

Quote of the Week...

“What’s with the ﬂak jacket? Where does this guy
think he is, El Salvador?”

Great Britain highest civilization

NICHOLAS L.
WADDY, ’96

 
 

h

This is Part Three in a series on the
many virtues of Western Civilization.

And so the end has finally come.
Now I have only to complete the circle
— to lay down the deﬁnitive vindica-
tion of the time and place we honor
with the distinction of Highest Civili-
zation: 19th-century Britain.

The reasons for this choice are var-

ied, and I effort to sup-

low. Know- British edu-
ingasldothat cational sys-

my readership prizes intellectual con-
sistency, I will try to conﬁne my argu-
ments to the three-tiered model of civi-
lization I articulated in Part One.
Learning is the most ambiguous of
the three categories of civilization
where British primacy is concerned;
that is, it is by no means obvious, even
to me, that Great Britain, in the 19th

century or any other, has possessed a
decided and obvious advantage in terms
of its educational and scholastic ad-
vancement. Partisans of French, Ger-
man, American, or Italian intellectual
achievements, for example, might have
an equally strong case. Nevertheless,
one thing is clear: the importance of
hierarchy and class divisions, which
we mentioned in Part Two, has over-
tones in the sphere of learning that
necessarily disqualify the contempo-
rary American educational system from
any reasonable claim to high achieve-
ment. Today’s American system, and
the systems of all too many other na-
tions, are based on the same facile
notions of human equality we criti-
cized so justly two weeks ago. Any

tem may have had in the 19th-century,
egalitarianism was not one of them.
Insofar as charity is concerned, I
will remind the reader of Joseph
Chamberlain’s conﬁdent assertion that
Imperial Britain was “the greatest force
for good the world has ever seen”.
Times have changed since Chamber-
lain put forward this analytical gem, of

course. The United States, because of
its unique contributions during both
World Wars and because of its leader-
ship in the anti-Communist crusade of
the Cold War, can now lay, I think,
very plausible claim to the title of
history’s most benevolent power. In
one crucial respect, however, Britain’s
role as a Great Power was played with
greater “charity”. Here I speak of co-
lonialism. I realize it may be unpopu-
lar these days to speak of colonialism
in anything like a positive light, but this
prejudice rests on a fallacy that is all
too easy to expose: that colonialism is
a thing of the past — that we enlight-
ened Americans have no part in it to-
day. This is, of course, nonsense; even
now the United States and the other
Western powers consciously maintain
a de facto control over events in virtu-
ally every comer of the globe. When
our interests are threatened by events
in the Third World, we rarely think
twice about using whatever means we
think necessary to re-establish the Pax
Americana wherever it may be threat-
ened. The crucial differenceis that
British imperialism admitted it’s own
existence —— a proper tribute to intel-
lectual honesty — and the British were
more willing to admit that with power,
fonnalized or not, comes responsibil-
ity. British imperialism was a none-
too unsuccessful exercise in noblesse
oblige. Some may quibble, but that is
my view.

lastly, I must address the role played
by order in human civilization. The
social and political order current in
Britain during the 19th-century was, to
my discriminating eye, very nearly
perfect. Socially, Britain had the ben-
efit of a ‘well-defined and healthy
class system.

Egalitarian and Socialist agitation
did not become a major factor in Brit-

ish politics until the turn of the century.
What is more, while Britain possessed
just the kind of hierarchical social struc-
ture that I favored in Part Two, hers
was.not so rigid as to prevent worthy
individuals from rising above the cir-
cumstances of their birth. Men like
David Lloyd George and Alfred Milner
were able to rise from the low end of
British society to become two of its
leading lights, albeit at the close of the
period in question. In short, individual
progress was possible, but the social
order was nonetheless held intact.

Politically, Britain was still pos-
sessed of that most ingenious and prac-
tical of all governmental systems: the
mixed constitution. Monarchy, aris-
tocracy, and democracy each occupied
a central place in the British system
(though by this time the actual power
of the Monarch had become danger-
ously inadequate).

The House of Lords continued to
act as a respected and powerful compo-
nent of the British government, articu-
lating the legitimate concerns of that
country’s historic ruling and landed
classes. The House of Commons,
elected throughout most of the century
by a small minority of Englishmen,
proved eminently capable of govern-
ing both Britain and the Empire effi-
ciently, prudently, and (within limits)
magnanimously.

My defense of the primacy of Brit-
ish civilization must end here. I could
speak at length about British achieve-
ments, or about British decline for that
matter, but that will have to be for
another day. Let me only add that I
hope any of my readers who disagree
with my views on this most important
of subjects will avail himself of the
opportunity to respond. As always,
the battlefield of ideas awaits’ a
brave recruit...

DNC must be rebuilt from grassroots up

NOVA
CLARKE,
’96

 

As some of you may know, the Democratic Na-
tional Committee has just appointed Christopher
Dodd, a Connecticut Senator, as General Chair of the
DNC, and Don Fowler of South Carolina as National
Chairman. This demonstrates a deﬁnite change in the
orientation. and focus of the DNC. The past chair,
David Wilhelm, did not have the necessary personal-
ity to be an effective chairman. Both Dodd and
Fowler are at home in the company of politicians.
This is an important asset in managing the various
factions and egos within the Democratic party. Dodd,
as a Senator, is used to both building coalitions and
dealing with politicians as individuals. Fowler, a
veteran of South Carolina, is versed in the changing

* dynamics of the South. Both of these qualities are

necessary for the Democrats not to be totally wiped
out of the picture in 1996. An article deﬁned him as
a ‘visceral’ Democrat. One definitions of visceral is
“proceeding from instinctive rather than intellectual
motivation.” I can hear the groan now; Democrats
acting from the heart and soul instead of from the
brain is precisely what got this country into trouble.

For me visceral doe_sn’t ‘imply the big-hearted
liberals, but the Democrats who are emotionally tied
into the country as a whole. They weren ’t Democrats
because that is the party they could win the election
with. They were Democrats because that is the party

they felt a connection to. As a Democrat, I can totally
understand this sentiment. There is great appeal for
me to abandon the Democratic party for the Green
party, whose speciﬁc policies and goals are more in
line with my ideals. A larger part of me, however, is
attached to the Democratic party. My mother’s family
has always voted Democratic. My

mother will not vote for a Repub-

them, becoming professional politicians. Though
the idea of politicians being controlled solely by the
special interests is misinformed, it is the perception
not the truth that often matters. Dodd’s desire to take
the party back to the grassroots is even a better move
under these circumstances.

Personally, I would like to see
the Democrats articulate some

lican. If she doesn’t approve of
the Democrat, she votes for the

(C

positive goals. The Republicans
have taken over the conversa-

independent. I’m not quiteasada- Tlzere is grea£ap' tion, and are dominating it with
mant about this; I voted for a ea or me toa an- their Contract and their goals for
Republican in last year’s Florida $0" tfyle Democratic the future. Democrats are left
Senate race. There is also a senti- responding to the Republicans,
mental tie to the great traditions party f0?‘ the Green and appear as obstructionists

of the Democratic party, and a
spark of hope that the party can
now return to it’s roots of being
the people’s party, instead as the
party of big government.

Dodd is aware of this need to
communicate with the people. In
an interview shortly after his
nomination he stated his desire to rebuild the party
from the grassroots up. Another Democrat stated it
even better. Senator Barbara Mikulski, in an editorial
in the Washington Post said, “Democrats must figure
out what works. We must be advocates for people and
not automatically defend every government program.”

Another thing that Democrats must realize is that
people are alienated when they think politicians are
basing their actions purely on the calculation of their
re-election chances. Disgust with government origi-
nates from the idea that politicians never descend
from Washington to see what the rest of the country
wants. They stay in DC and let the lobbyists inform

party, whose spe-
cific policies and
goals are more in
line with my ideals.

since on many occasions they
don’t have a cohesive alternative
to offer.

When asked what the Demo-
cratic party stands for, I often
respond with what I wish it would
stand for, since what it stands for
is not really known. I hope that"
President Clinton articulates some goals for the
Democrats. He has two more years during which he
will the single most powerful person in America. It
is imperative that those two years count. There has
often been a relunctance to use the veto because it is
perceived negatively. Clinton needs to use the veto
to stop legislation which goes against the stated
goals of the Democrats. In doing so, however, he

must provide a justification and suggestions so the .

veto does not take on the airt of a partisan weapon.
Clinton’s most important role is to take control of
the debate and reassert himself as chair of the
Democratic party.

Presidential Search, look no further

GREEN LAND
Betsy Green

I’ve been doing a lot of thinking
lately about that whole search for a
new President of Washington and Lee
and I’ve come up with the perfect can-
didate: me. At thistime I would like to
throw my hat in the ring.

I would make one excellent Univer-
sity President. It seems like the perfect
job for me. I can schmooze with trust-
ees, hit people up for money, and live
in the Lee House with Mrs. Wilson.
She comes with the job, doesn’t she?

My past experience will be sure to
help me. Really, it would. My job
detassling corn when I was a junior in
high school, um, taught me a lot about
corn, and...I’m sure it will come up
somehow. And then I know my job in
the Exciting World of French Fashion
(sales associe at Express) will help me
out. My work there has given me tons
of skills for sucking up to wealthy
people. I can ﬁnd some way to compli-
ment anyone. Instead of saying things
like, “That’s a really slutty outﬁt you’ve
chosen,” or say, “That’s a really ugly
building you want us to build,” I can
come up with something that would be
tactful yet get the point across. I can
also serve as a wardrobe advisor for the
many wayward professors we have
here. I can give advice like, “Maybe
you should own more than one tie.”

Just think of all of the fun contro-
versy that having me as President would

cause. W&L has been a pretty contro-
versy—free place, with the notable ex-
ception of the Suzi the Sex Girl (I love
her) in Lee Chapel thing. With a woman
as President of W&L, any alumni who
were opposed to co—education but
maybe sitting on the fence as to whether
or not to donate money will have
a much easier time making up
their minds.

My ﬁrst act as W&L president would

posed Washington and Lee Naked Day.
Go to class naked (don’t worry, kids——
you can still wear your pledge pins
somehow). Get served your potatoes in
the D-hall by nude FIJI ’s. They ’ll prob-
ably have some kind of special Nude-
Themed dinner with open-faced sand-
wiches or something. Think of how
great it would be...for one thing, W&L
students are all good-looking -- almost
eerily so. And think of how your rela-

a hard time getting

course I use my
power. I think all of
you will eventually
realize that putting
your Jeep in the
President’s parking
space is simply not
a good idea. I can
see to it that after you graduate, the
Capital Fund people call you at least
three times a day. You can run, but you
can’t hide. '

As President of the University, I can
also try to start fun new traditions. One
of them, amazingly enough, was sug-
gested by_ Richard Weaver. He pro-

with my other
role as Faculty
F a s h i o n
Advisor,but
that’s okay.
Dinners and
receptions that
the President
has to throw
could be spiced
up with my own special brand of enter-
taining. Who wouldn’t love to do a
beer slide with Thomas Wolfe? If that’s
not enough, I could have W&L Cater-
ing serve food that exempliﬁes all that
is Washington and Lee. No, it would
not come from Andrew Schnieder’s
book. Instead, it would come from

Sarah Gilbert’s upcoming book Cook-
ing with Alcohol. Wealthy graduates
and their checkbooks can come to the
Lee House for dinner with me and the
results will be amazing. If we put
enough white wine in Sarah’s Sword-
ﬁsh with Roasted Yellow Pepper and
White Wine Sauce, enough bourbon in
the Mashed Sweet Potatoes With Bour-
bon, and then ﬁll them up with Sarah’s
Secret Recipe Irish Creme Fudge for
dessert, we can have that science build-
ing paid for in no time.

Probably the my most lasting legacy
will be when I make an improvement
on an aspect of W&L life that is noto-
riously bad. This is a problem so hor-
rible that it made me seriously recon-
sider coming here. I am referring, of
course, to the coffee served in the co-
op. This vile excuse for coffee will be
rapidly phased out as soon as I take
office. Instead we will drink freshly
ground gourmet coffee from Lexing-
ton Coffee Roasters. All the wimps
who put stuff in their coffee (cream and
sugar) will be charged extra.

I have to admit, though, that I want
to be W&L’s President for some fairly
selﬁsh reasons. The Lee House would
be great for parties. I’d have the whole
parking problem, the biggest challenge
in Lexington, all wrapped up. Most
importantly, I remain conﬁdent that
my grades will improve in spite of the
long hours I’ll have to spend doing
presidential stuff. All I’ll need to say is,
“Perhaps you should rethink giving
your boss such a low grade. Besides,
I’ve seen you naked.”

The men’s basketball team
ended last week’s two-game los-
ing skid last Friday night with an
81-75 winover Catholic in Wash-
ington, D.C.

The Generals grabbed" a 34-
28 halftime lead and fought
Catholic to a draw the rest of the
way to preserve the six-point vic-
tory.

Junior Cam Dyer converted a
critical three-point play with0:54
to play to seal the game, record-
ing a career-high 31 point effort
to go along with his game-high
11 rebounds.

Fellow junior Derek Carter
grabbed 10 rebounds and added
17 points, connecting three times
from downtown, and senior Mark
Connelly contributed 16 points
in 19 minutes.

On Monday, the Generals con-
tinued their recent successes at
home, raising their home record
to 6-3 by coming from behind to
defeat Old Dominion Athletic
Conference rival Bridgewater 78-
74. ‘

Bridgewater held leads as
large as 14 points, but the Gener-
als pulled to within two late in the
second half.

After Bridgewater rallied for

 clans, career min;

g, .$l..mil1i0n

a six-point edge with less than
two minutes to go, sophomore
Matt Clark hit the boards for a
putback and a foul, and Carter
followed with a score to cut the
lead to one.

Junior Jon Coffman com-
pleted the turnaround on a go-
ahead three-pointer with 29 sec-
onds remaining. Coffman posted
18 of his 21 points in the second
half to lead the Generals come-
back drive, along with Carter’s
17 points. Leading-scorer Dyer
added 15, and sophomore guard
Chris Couzen hit for 12.

Head coach Verne Canfield
commented, “I was obviously
pleased to come back from 14
points down to win, and the kids
are continuing to re-leam what it
takes to win.”

Wednesday took the Gener-
als to face the South ’s top-ranked
team, ODAC leader Hampden-
Sydney. The game was tied 8-8
early when Hampden-Sydney
racked up a 24-4 run to take com-
mand with a 56-30 halftime ad-
vantage. '

W&L cut the lead to 17 on a
three-pointer from Coffman early
in the second half but couldn’t
draw any closer, losing by the
score of 96-79, as Hampden-
Sydney remained undefeated in
the ODAC.

Freshman Jimmy Schweer

- . 
.9 {papers are filled

had a career-high 21 points to
lead the Generals, and Dyer and
Connelly each had 10 points in
the losing effort.

The 2-1 week leaves the Gen-
erals even with a 8-8 record, 4-5
in the ODAC.

. When asked if progress had
been made on improving team
defense and addressing other
concerns, coach Canﬁeld equivo-
cated, “Yes and no. lt’s a matter
of consistency and sustaining an
effort. We need to stop those
lapses, but I see good progress.
As long as they’re playing hard
and playing together, we’ll be
ﬁne.”

Consistency continues to be a
problem for the Generals, who
have experienced several ups and
downs so far this season.

“There’s no so much you can
do to address that,” Canﬁeld re-
marked. “You just keep working
in the direction you set out at and
keep people focused on the goal.
It’s always a problem when you
have two or more losses in a row.
It’s called momentum. Most
people think of momentum as a
positive thing, but it can go the
other way too.”

The Generals now face
ODAC rival Guilford in Greens-
boro, N.C. on Saturday, before
taking to the road against
Bridgewater.

The Washington and Lee men’s swimming
team left the University of North Carolina last
Saturday with a split following an intense tri-meet
with Emory and Johns Hopkins.

The Generals routed an excellent Emory team
83-39, but were edged by Johns Hopkins 65-57 in
a meet which came down to the ﬁnal race.

Washington and Lee won eight individual races
in the meet, but Hopkins accumulated enough
points to stick with W&L and force the winner of
the meet to be decided in the ﬁnal event, the 400-
freestyle relay. Hopkins prevailed in 3:12.63, a
scant .48 of a second faster than the Generals.

Despite the tough ﬁnish, head coach Paige
Remillard remained upbeat over the meet.

“We beat a top ten team in Emory, and we’re not
depressed that we lost to Johns Hopkins,” he stated.

Numerous key individual perfonnances facili-
tated the Generals’ effort. Sophomore Nathan Hottle
stormed his way to three victories, and junior Frank
Braden garnered two individual wins.

Braden captured the 200-freestyle in a time of
1:46.97, and senior Tony Diedrich finished behind

Following an impressive victory by Emory’s
Peter Hommer in the 100-back, the Generals reeled
off four consecutive triumphs.

Hottle led off the streak and scored the ﬁrst of
his three individual conquests in the 100-breast,
finishing in just over a minute at 1:00.02.

Senior Grant Holicky took third in 1:01.09.
Freshman Erik Holbrook prevailed in the 200-
butterﬂy with a time of 2:03.05, and junior David
Stillman followed by triumphing in the 50-free in
48.73 seconds to complete the victory string.

Junior Craig Sears posted a personal best time in
the 200-back by ﬁnishing third in 2:03.39.

Hottle and Braden outswam the competition in
their victories in the 200-breast and 500-free, re-
spectively, and Hott1e’s conquest in the 400-IM in
a time of 4:15 .95 set the stage for the dramatic ﬁnal
event

“We can’t be upset over the finish,” Remillard
remarked. “We have no control over what the other
team does. We can only control what we do. We’re
excited about the times we ran, and we’re pleased
with where we are now.”

The Generals tote a record of 4-1 into this
Saturday’s home meet against Radford at Cy
Twombly Memorial Pool.

Having clobbered Mary Baldwin College on
Wednesday, Washington & Lee’swomen’sswim
team is off to a strong start with a 6-2 overall
mark.

The Generals took ﬁrst place in all 12 events
in the 139-66 win. Senior Brandi Henderson (200
& 400 free) and junior Rebekah Prince (200
breast & 200 IM) had two wins apiece in the
romp.

Overall, the Generals are looking at one of
their best seasons ever.

“We’re doing pretty well on the year as a
whole,” said head coach Kiki Jacobs. “So far
we’ve had some real good swims, and the big win
against Catholic.”

The team has two weeks to gear up for the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference Championships,
to be hosted by W&L, and seems to be approach-
ing peak form. ’

Jacobs was pleased with her team’s perfor-
mance last Saturday at UNC-Chapel Hill al-
though the Generals were beaten by perennial
NCAA powers Emory and Johns Hopkins.

Emory topped W&L 101-20, while Hopkins
posted a 95-23 victory.

Jacobs said the Generals were not expecting to
win the meets, but were looking for experience
against some top competition.

Prince was one bright spot for the Generals in
the meet, taking second in the 100 backstroke in

1:03.52, and third in the 200 back in a time of
2:15.27. Both are the top times in the ODAC so
far this season.

cc to top squads

W&L also got a third place ﬁnish from freshman
Megan Wiedmaier in the 500 free (5229.65).

Wiedmaier and her classmates are a significant
part of the Generals’ success this season.

“[The freshmen] have added variety and depth to
the team, and a lot of spirit,” said sophomore Danielle
Burghardt. “They’re a great group of girls.”

Jacobs feels its Burghardt’s own class that is still
the Generals’ strength as they aim to repeat as
ODAC champions. The group of ﬁve sophomores
has continued to impact as they did as freshmen a
year ago.

“They’re still doing real well,” Jacobs said. “lt’s
our strongest class, besides our biggest.”

Burghardt says the group has come together in
their season and a half of competition.

“We started out not knowing each other much,
but we’ve bonded as a group,” said Burghardt. “I
think we’ve really progressed.”

The Generals host Radford at the Cy Twombly
pool Saturday beginning at 10:00 am in a meet that
Jacobs expects her squad to have no trouble with.
W&L’s toughest competition is likely to come in
the season’s ﬁnale, the Southern States Champion-
ships in late February.

This will be the ﬁrst trip to this meet for the
women, who usually conclude their season with the
ODAC/Atlantic States Championships.

“We needed a more competitive meet to end the
season,” Jacobs said.

She also pointed out that W&L’s men and women
both seem to perform better when competing to-
gether. Therefore, by joining the men at the Davidson,
NC meet, Jacobs believes her swimmers will be at
their best, and her team tends to agree.

“lt’s harder competition,” said junior Jill Sheets,
“but I think it’ll help everyone swim their best.”

Women lose sixth in a row i

By ERIC SWENSEN
Phi Staff Writer

Coach Terri Dadio remains
pleased with her squad’s im-
provement this year, only the
second for W&L women’s bas-
ketball, but the improvement
didn’t translate into victories last
week as the Generals dropped
contests against Randolph Ma-
con and Guilford to extend their
losing streak to six games.

In Greensboro last Saturday,
the Generals were able to hang
close for a half against Guilford
before fading early in the second
frame, losing 69-52.

In the Guilford game,

Michelle Hicks concluded a
strong week in which she aver-
aged eight points and six re-
bounds per game with nine points
and ten boards.

Last night Randolph Macon
took on the Generals for the sec-
ond time in a week as they visited
the Warner Center.

The result was much the same
as the Generals came out on the
short end of a 63-48 score.

Sandra Holmes led the way
with 14 points and 12 boards as
W&L dropped its sixth consecu-
tive game.

The next home action for the
Generals comes this Tuesday as
they take on Mary Baldwin Col-

lege in the Warner Center.

The Lady Generals take to the
road against Catholic on Satur-
day as they look to end their )\
current slide.

Even with the apparent lack
of success, head coach Terri
Dadio remains upbeat as her
Generals look for a strong ﬁnish
to the season in order to qualify
for the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference tournament.

“I think we are getting better
each game,” said Dadio. ~“If we
play as hard as we have been >“
playing and if we show any more
signs of improvement we are
going to have a strong ﬁnish to
our season.”

Freshman arrested for marijuana possession

BY MICHAEL Hswrerr
Phi Staff Writer

A second Washington and Lee student was arrested after a
W&L security officer found marijuana in his room.

Freshman Omar Vannoy was arrested on Jan. 22 and
charged with marijuana possession, a misdemeanor under
Virginia state law.

On Dec. 2, 1994, freshman Eric Daur was arrested and
charged with possession with intent to distribute 6 ounces of
marijuana valued at $1,100, which is a felony.

Police said Vannoy had three ounces of marijuana valued
at $540.

Vannoy said he was watching a movie with his girlfriend
when W&L security knocked on his door. Security told his
girlfriend to leave, he said. He admitted to having marijuana
when security asked him about it.

Security evicted him immediately and told him to wait

there. Vannoy then went to Dean Howison’s office, escorted
by dorm counselor Adam Plotkin.

He said he got the marijuana in Texas during winter break.
Vannoy paid $320 for it. Officer Gary Coleman who arrested
Vannoy said that had a dealer sold it on the street, the
marijuana would have cost $540.

Vannoy contends he was never arrested, but Coleman
said that in Virginia, the moment a suspect is served with a
warrant, he is arrested.

“Any time you have a warrant where the suspect cannot
leave, he is arrested,” he said.

Coleman said because the charge was a misdemeanor, he
had the choice of whether to release him or not. He believed
Vannoy would not ﬂee the country.

Vannoy was told that he had to be out of Graham-Lees
dorm by Monday night. He said he stayed at the Holiday Inn.
On Tuesday he said he talked with his lawyer, H. David
Natkin. Vannoy said on Thursday, Jan. 26, he went to the
Lexington Police Department and was officially charged
with marijuana possession.

Vannoy suspects his roommate, freshman Douglas Bryan
Hesney, tipped security off. He thinks his Hesney turned him

in so he could have the room to himself.

Plotkin and Hesney both refuted that charge. Plotkin
declined to say who told security about Vannoy.

Director of Security Mike Young also refuted Vannoy’s
suspicions.

“I think it’s unfortunate that Mr. Vannoy would say things
like that.”

Vannoy said he originally had four ounces of marijuana
before he smoked it. He said he had at most two ounces left
when security found it. Coleman said it was three ounces but
he will not be sure until the marijuana comes back from the
lab where it was tested and measured.

Vannoy said his court date was February 14 but has been
changed to February 21. He said he will probably join the
Marijuana Offenders program for first-time offenders. He
said the program lasts 10 to 12 weeks, and participants are
subject to urine analysis. His license has been suspended for
six months, he said. After the program, Vannoy said he will
be under unmonitored probation and after a year the charges
will be dropped. The school is waiting to see how his case
goes before the Student Conduct Committee.

Presently Vannoy is living at the Dutch Inn. Police are still
investigating.

Women and Leadership Samples to play
promotes unity among
female leaders

BY DAN QDENWALD
Phi Staff Writer

Carol Pierce ’95 and Karlene Jennings ’96
want to make Washington and Lee a friendlier
place for female student leaders. Last spring
the turned their hope into a group called
Women and Leadership.

Women and Leadership is a loosely bonded
group of female student leaders dedicated to
“contributing to the success and self- esteem
of women leaders on campus.”

They hold special events throughout the
year including receptions and dinners that
promote unity among women leaders. The
events also serve as opportunities for “affir-
mation, education, and the exchange of ideas,”
between those leaders.

For example, a post-Women’s Rush

   

reception was held Wednesday night for fresh-
men women. Class of 1998 Vice—President
Mary Jo Mahoney and Katherine Steuart ’98
led the event. It was intended to unify the
freshmen women after a divisive Rush.

The group is currently planning a plethora
of events. On January 31, Women and Lead-
ership hosted a reception for Helen Thomas,‘
the former UPI White House correspondent.
They are also working on a newsletter detail-
ing what women leaders are currentlydoing
on campus. In the Spring a women’s leader-
ship conference will be held at Skylark.

“There is a need for more communication
between the women’s groups on campus,”
said Co-founder Carol Pierce. She sees a
need to “encourage campus involvement,”
among female students.

Superdance tonight

BY PETE WEISSMAN
Phi Staff Writer

By dancing at the Samples concert tonight
in the Pavilion, Washington and Lee students
can raise thousands of dollars for the Muscu-
lar Dystrophy Association.

Big Hairy Posse, a band that includes
recent W&L graduates, will kickoff the 16th
Annual Superdance for MDA at 9 p.m. Last
year, the event raised $12,000 for wheel-
chairs and special services. Superdance co-
chairman Trey Block hopes the event will
gross $30,000 this year.

The Samples concert has sparked calls
from across the state for tickets, said co-
chairrnan Tina Hand.

“They’ve really established themselves
as a great band,” Hand said.

BHP’s performance will be a welcome
ﬂashback for many W&L upperclassmen.

“The fact that they’re coming back to-
gether after some of them have graduated is
really exciting,” Hand said.

For Superdance, students collect dona-
tions and pledges and attend a concert. Last
year, about 800 students attended the David
Allan Coe concert, and about 50 of them
collected contributions.

If W&L donates $25,000 to MDA, W&L
can send a representative to Las Vegas to
present the check to Jerry Lewis on the Labor
Day weekend telethon. In 1985, when the
minimum was $20,000, W&L sent a repre-
sentative, said Fontanne Bostic, University
Services administrative assistant.

Through the years, the event has evolved
from a battle-of-the-bands to a dance—a—thon
to its current format as a single night concert,
Hand said.

Past acts include Drivin’-n-Cryin’ and the
Dave Matthews Band.

Prizes will go to the fraternity and sorority
that raise the most money. Last year’s win-
ners were Phi Delta Theta with $2000 and
Chi Omega with $700.

Two Lexington teenagers were arrested Thursday
in connection with the attempted armed robbery of two
Washington and Lee students.

The two students were held at gun point at different
times on Friday night.

Lexington Chief of Police Bruce Beard said one
teenager was charged with attempted robbery, grand
larceny and entering a dwelling with the intent to
commit larceny. Police charged the other suspect with
attempted armed robbery and use of a firearm in the
commission of a felony. Beard said police are still
investigating and other arrests will be made.

A sophomore was walking north on Randolph Street
with two friends near the coin laundry around 8:30
p.m., said Beard.

A group of eight male teenagers confronted the
student and asked him for money. The student and his
friends kept walking until one of the teenagers pulled
out a gun and pointed it at the student. At that time, a
police car passed by and the teenager put the gun away
and fled with his friends.

Beard said the student walked to a house at the
intersection of Randolph Street and Massey Street.
After a short time, the gunman knocked on the door and
someone let him in the house. Police said that the
teenager went upstairs and returned with a stereo.
Beard said the student asked the teenager to put the gun
away and turned to walk away. Another teenager
apologized and said his friend who pulled out the gun
was drunk.

Lts. Wayne Straub and Torben Pedersen
are investigating.

later that night at 11 p.m., a freshman was walking
north in the 100 block of Randolph Street.

Beard said a group of three males followed the
freshman. One of the men approached him and pointed
a gun at him, asking for money. The freshman told him
that he didn’t have any money, according to Beard.

The man fired a gun at the freshman, but did not hit
him. Afterward, the man told the freshman that his
friends made him do it. The other two men told him to
empty his pockets, Beard said. After they determined
that the freshman had no money, they walked ahead
north on Randolph Street.

Both students’ descriptions of the gunman matched.

The $10 admission can be paid at the door. People
who raise $100 in donations will get in free.

“It promises to be an outstanding evening,” Hand
said.

White House correspondent speaks I 
about experiences with six presidents 

By CINDY YOUNG
Phi Staff Writer

“All roads lead to the Oval Office,”
Helen Thomas declared in her speech
in Lee Chapel Tuesday evening; one
might add that for the last half century
she has traveled most of these roads.

In her speech co-sponsored by Con-
tact, Women’s Forum and Women in
Leadership, Thomas reflected on her
impressive career as a journalist, span-
ning five decades and six presiden-
cies.

Hired by United Press International
in 1941, Thomas firts conducted radio
interviews dealing with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the Depart-
ment of Health, Education and Wel-
fare, and Capitol Hill.

In 1960, Thomas covered the presi-
dential campaign of John F. Kennedy
and followed him to the White House
the following year.

In covering presidential personali-
ties, Thomas soon became a personal-

ity herself. Her “Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent” at the close of a press conference
has become a White House tradition.

Thomas’s presence has not been
limited to the arena of White House
interviews, however.

In 1959, Thomas became president
of the Women’s National Press Club,
later being named the first female
officer of the National Press Club it-
self.

In her speech, “Inside the White
House,” Thomas first highlighted the
current achievements and problems of
the Clinton administration.

Thomas credits Clinton with play-
ing a significant role in the stabiliza-
tion Haiti, the end of apartheid in South
Africa, the continued suppression of
Saddam Hussein, and talks recently
begun to end the violence of Northern
Ireland.

To this list of foreign accomplish-
ments, Thomas added such domestic
measures as the Motor Voter Bill,
NAFTA, the Brady Bill, Goals 2000,
the Family Leave Bill, and the Na-
tional Service Act.

Even with both the House and Sen-
ate now under Republican control, and
his unimpressive public approval rat-
ings, Thomas doesn’t “count Clinton
out.” (She points to Bush’s 90 percent
approval rating in 1991.) The presi-
dent, Thomas quipped, “has many miles
to go before he sleeps.”

Turning from Clinton’s career to
her own, Thomas spoke of her impres-
sions of the office of the presidency in
general, and over time.

“So many presidents and their
wives,” Thomas said, “have mourned
the goldﬁsh bowl they live in,” yet she
does not sympathize with them.

In her experience, presidents actu-
ally enjoy “lots of privacy and much
privilege.” Thomas cited such privi-
leges as private helicopters and Air
Force One.

The close scrutiny of the press which
accompanies these luxuries is a fact for
which Thomas does not apologize: “Ir-
reverence is the way we play this game.”

Jefferson, after all, once said that
“eternal vigilance is the price of lib-
erty.”

“People can handle the truth,” Tho-
mas emphasized, “and deserve no less.”

Expressing her disappointment in
the increasing tabloidization of the
mainstream press, Thomas neverthe-
less intends to play under the newest
rules, instead of wishing for “the good
old days.’

Thomas sees other important devel-
opments in the media as well, owing to
technology.

“With CNN bringing the world’s
pain into our living rooms everyday,
we do live in a global village.”

The chief responsibility of the press,
for Thomas, remains the same, how-
ever: “to keep the people informed and
democracy alive.”

In her impressive career, Thomas

I

has adhered to this purpose, even as the. .5 ii;

press and the world beyond evolve.

Thomas’s dedication to this prin-
ciple, the basis of her career, can be
glimpsed in her own words.

Asked by a member of Tuesday’s
audience how long she intends to be
doing what she does, Thomas instantly
replied, “Forever.”

Women and Leadership unites W&L females

I->WOMEN, page 1

The group was organized last Spring Term after
a dinner for female students and faculty was held in
which over 200 women attended.

“There was a desire for female students to get to
know the female faculty members and to find out
what their life was like,” said Dean Anne Schroer-
Lamont, Women and Leadership’s faculty advisor.
Female students can boost their self-confidence by
emulating female faculty role models, said Schroer-
Lamont.

Since freshman men were meeting upperclass
men through Rush,Women and Leadership hosted a
freshman reception in October to give freshman
women a chance to meet upperclass women, said
Pierce.

“We want to see freshmen women use the lead-

ership potential that got them into W&L in the first
place,” said Co-founder Karlene Jennings.

Women and Leadership receives funding from
many different campus groups including the Women’s
Forum, the four sororities, Panhellenic, the Deans,
and the E.C.

While the group was founded to solidify bonds
between female student leaders, it was also created in
response to statistics which reﬂect a discrepancy
between the numbers of male and female leaders.

“Women are not well represented in the top stu-
dent government slots,” said Shroer-Lamont. She
added that in ten years of coeducation at W&L the
E.C. has never been 40% female.

Schroer—Lamont also believes women are at a
disadvantage in student elections because male stu-
dents tend to vote in blocks.

“Males in fraternities tend to support each other
and vote together for other males. Femalestudentsare

more individualistic in their voting behaviors and
often suffer as a result,” she said.

Despite this trend, Pierce, Jennings, and Schroer-
Lamont said Women and Leadership will not be a

lobbying group for female candidates during student I 

elections.

Schroer—Lamont also believes that women are '

if .

under-represented in the faculty and administration ‘ j

as well.

“Some female students go through this University "' 

without ever taking a class with a female professor,” 

she said.

She pointed out that no women are represented in 

W&L’s top administrative echelon.
“Not one woman is involved in making the really
big decisions,” she added.

If Women and Leadership succeeds in its goals,  _

these sitautions may change.

Symposium to discuss plays

By JENNIFER LATHAM
Phi Staff Writer

When she directs a play in French,
Domnica Radulescu begins rehears-
als by asking her student actors to
make animal noises in unison.

Radulescu, a Washington and Lee
French professor, thinks the warm-up
helps students forget their inhibitions
and improves their acting in a foreign
language.

“It takes them out oftheir routine,”
said Radulescu. “It forces them to
take risks, to express themselves.”

Radulescu will share these kinds
of ideas with other professors who
direct foreign-language plays in the
First National Symposium on Theater
in Academe. The symposium will be
held at W&L Feb. 4 and 5.

About 50 students, professors, ac-
tors and playwrights from more than
10 states will give speeches on direct-
ing and acting in foreign-language
plays. The speeches will highlight the
benefits of theater as a pedagogical
exercise and the challenges that stu-
dents encounter as inexperienced
actors.

A group of W&L students will
present skits in German. And French
students will perform a scene from
Eugene Ionesco’s “Rhinoceros,”

which they staged last spring.

Radulescu said symposium partici-
pants seem excited about sharing ideas
about foreign-language theater.

“lt’s as if people were waiting to
express what they’ve gathered from
their experience,” Radulescu said.

W&L senior Ginny Guthrie, who is
helping Radulescu organize the con-
ference, will talk about her acting ex-
perience in “Rhinoceros.”

“Not only do you have to under-
stand what’s going on [in a foreign
language], you have to make other
people understand, too,” Guthrie said.
“Seeing it all played out and doing it
ourselves...takes regular literary analy-
sis a step further.”
Guthrie said she had worried that
Radulescu’s class could not learn lines,
gather props and rehearse enough dur-
ing spring term to make “Rhinoceros”
a success.

“In six weeks instead of 12 weeks,
there are so many different pieces that
have to come together,” said Guthrie.

Radulescu agreed. She and other
directors at the symposium will discuss
the ways they solved students’ prob-
lems in acting.

“The hardest part [of directing “Rhi-
noceros”] was to get the feel of the
characters, the nuances...the spirit of
the people, of the language, the ges-
tures,” said Radulescu.

As a director, German Professor

Roger Crockett said he also focuses on
helping students develop
stage presence.

“I find it very difficult sometimes to
get students to come out of their shells,
to stop speaking in monotone and to get
the woodenness out of their voices,”
Crockett said.

Actors and directors at the sympo-
sium will share performance success
stories, as well.

Crockett said students who have acted
in the German plays seem to have more
energy when they perform
for audiences.

“All of a sudden it just spills out of
them,” said Crockett. “When the chips
are down, it comes out.”

Radulescu said she also wants to talk
with other directors about the acting
skills students sometimes hide until
opening night of a play.

“The most thrilling part is when I see
a spark that comes from the student,”
Radulescu said. “Something comes out
of the student that I never saw in class
and conversation, sort of like a
little epiphany.”

The symposium will begin Saturday
at 9:30 a.m. and Sunday at 8:30 a.m. in
room109 of the University Center. Af-
ter 6 p.m., foreign-language theater
workshops will be held in the Lenfest
Center’sJohnson Theateruntil 9:30 p.m.

. The images bombard American society -
6‘n the front page of the newspapers, on the
cover of magazines, on tradable cardboard pic-
tures, in the movies, on the television screen,
even on boxes of cereal on the supermarket
shelves.

1 These are the images of celebrity sports
player, a new breed of hero which has perme-
ated all aspects of twentieth century American

3 society. Gone are the latter day heroes such as

Henry Ford or Paloma Picasso, aptly reveled
f r paramount breakthroughs such as techno-

ogical advancements in transportation or inno-
vations in the arts. Modern day America has
ushered in a new era, an era in which those who
sparkle on the recreational playing fields earn

' huge salaries as well as acclaim.

‘It With the passing of time the evolution of the
American hero and the forms of reward for

' these heroes has been drastically altered. Now

that sports ﬁgures have won the acclaim of
America they have also earned the spotlight.
American fascination with the outstanding ath-
letic qualities of these ﬁgures has lead to a
constant scrutiny and publication of the lifestyles
of professional athletes.

How do they do what they do? What makes
them so special? Americans’ wonderment has
ﬁroduced a barrage of journalistic recognition.
It is this attention which can elevate sports
celebrities to their eminent status, yet it is also
this attention which can prove debilitating to

. the glamorous lifestyle of famous athletes.

yr Would Pete Rose make national newspapers
headlines after receiving a jail sentence for tax
evasion if he were not an All-Star professional
baseball player? Would the drug rehabilitation
of professional tennis prodigy Jennifer Capriati
be featured on newscasts if she had remained a
ﬂedgling amateur tennis player?

Surely the alleged double murder of Nicole
Simpson and Ronald Goldman would not make

 

intema- t i o n a l
headlines if it were
not linked to former
football phenom,
O . J . Simpson.
The hype surround-
ing this murder is

n exem- plary illus-

ation of thelinkbe-
tween ce- lebrity sta-
tus and p u b l i c
scrutiny.

Soci- ology pro-
ﬁe s s o r D a v i d
Novack offered his
feelings regarding
the exten- sive pub-
l i c i t . """""“""""‘“’""'  “There is a

ultur)al A110-J-doll fascina-
tion with -- coming p o p u l a r
heroes soontoa andO.J. is
One Of store near those he’
roes.” Novack
also at- you tributed

Che lack of positive news stories and the publi-
cation of the O.J. story to society’s bizarre
fascination with violence and death.
The public scrutiny surrounded the trial of
this superstar is unbelievable. Even intema-
‘onal audiences are opening their local news-
papersto view headlines telling OJ. Simpson’s
woes. Radio talk shows are now devoting

A themselves entirely to public conjecture con-

cerning the guilt or innocence of O.J. Televi-
sion networks are devoting huge time slots to
five coverage of the trial. Bookstores are filled
with a selection of newly published books
chronicling the incidence. Even O.J. himself is
featured as an author of one of those narratives
of the circumstances surrounding the trial.

-1 In the informational black hole of Lexing-
ton, students are voicing opinions about the
publicity of the O.J. Simpson trial. Most stu-
dents convey a general feeling of distaste for
the continued comprehensive coverage of the
issue, yet some students voice genuine concern
about the events surrounding the trial.

One student said, “I think all the hype is
ridiculous. Doesn’t America have anything
better to do?”

Law students Dave Payne and Rob Grant
Questioned the fairness of the trial when asked
their feelings about the publicity of the OJ.
trial. Grant fears that the televised presentation
of the pretrial events and the trial itself has
created an environment which is not conducive
to the existence of an unbiased jury.

Sophomore Vivian Stone took matters into
her own hands. The night Fox aired its T.V.
movie of the O.J. story she attended an 0.1.
party. Guests were required to bring appropri-

te cocktails, of course. “You have to bring a

rink with ‘o.j.’ or some kinds of ‘juice’ in it,”
said Stone while the party was still in the
planning stages.

While many feelings are ambivalent and
subject to change with the revelations to come,
Gne thing will remain constant—— the coverage.
The coverage of the Simpson trial reflects more
than mere curiosity on behalf of the American
public. The publicity represents the malleabil-
ity of public opinion and the continued evolu-
qion of the American hero.

Today brings a break from the same old
weekend — the critically acclaimed play “She
Stoops to Conquer” makes its debut at the
Lenfest Center on Friday, February 3.

The seventeen talented cast members will
perform through Tuesday, February 7.

Jeff Tibbals, playing the role of Young
Marlow, and- Mandy Irons, playing Kate
Hardcastle, lead what is called “a sentimental

satirical play was a little too much for some
eighteenth century people to stomach.

It was referred to a “very wretched comedy”
with “no moral” and “no ediﬁcation of any
kind.” (This sounds a little like some W&L
students’ reactions to Suzi Landolphi.)

However, this narrow view of the play is
overshadowed by its timeless vitality and lon-
gevity.

In the ﬁrst year of its production, Dr. Samuel
Johnson said that “it makes the audience merry.”

Filled with oulandish practical jokes and
cases of mistaken identity, the show promises
to keep the audience in a constant state

of laughter.

Mandy Irons, playing
the lead role for her se-
nior thesis describes the
show as “really, really
funny.’

“The highlight of the
show is when everyone’s
plans backﬁre and ram
headlong into each
other,” said Irons.

The most ironic thing
about the play, however,
is that even though Oliver
Goldsmith wrote it as a
way out of debt and to
releive the pressure from
his creditors, the cost for
W&L students is free.

“When else in life are
you going to be able to
see live theater for free
rightoutyourbackdoor?”
said Irons.

In 1992,Antioch College,
located in Yellow Springs,
Ohio, passed its “Sexual Of-
fense Policy.” The policy has
since spawned much discussion,
criticism and publicity.

The policy was founded in an at-

 

tempt to combat the problem of date
rape at Antioch.

been parodied on SaturdayNightLive.

provide an atmosphere that promotes
healing.

The policy requires the initiator in
a romantic situation to obtain consent
from the other person before moving
on to another level of physical inti-
macy.

Consent is deﬁned as “verbal and
willing,” and the policy applies to
heterosexual and homosexual couples
as well as groups.

The policy has been criticized as a

said

Antioch junior Claire Mills.

The policy also requires students
to take responsibility for what they
say.
Karen Hall, Antioch’s Director of
Sexual Offense Prevention and Survi-
vors’ Advocacy Programs, said,
“Antioch is not in the business of
‘legislating kids.’ Respect and com-
munication start early in a relation-
ship; under the covers is a little late.”

Antioch’s policy may be an ex-
ample of the consequences of the per-
missive society in which we live. Once

things such as pre—-marital sex, ho-
mosexuality, promiscuity and por-
nography were not tolerated by the
mores of society. The sexual revo-
lution changed morality.

Today teen pregnancy, child
abuse, acquaintance rape and do-
mestic violence are major social
problems. Sex scandals such as
Packwood, Fisher/Buttafuoco and
Bobbitt stories carry the news.

Traditional social codes no longer

exist. Women are afraid of social
violence, and men are afraid that
they might be misconstrued as mon-
sters.

Maybe both sexes might beneﬁt
from a few guidelines. Antioch has
tried a new policy in an attempt to
deal with changing social mores.
maybe it isn’t perfect, but has Hall
said, “The policy is humanizing -
it brings both people actively into a
sexual relationship.”

Founded September 18, 1897

Our Bubble Has Burst...

Crime has always been something Washington and Lee
students treat as what happens to “someone else.” They tell
us that we, here in the peaceful little quaint hamlet of
Lexington, live “in a bubble.” Once we get out in the real
world, they tell us, things will be different.

Washington and Lee welcomes the real world to Lexing-
ton. Not with open arms, perhaps, but the real world has
come, and we must accept it.

We refer to those recent criminal acts which have shocked,
or at least startled, our fair campus. Guns pulled on...and shot
at...students. Pretty scary stuff, but not unusual in a city-type
situation that we will soon be thrust into.

Students at Washington and Lee are starting to lock their
doors more regularly. Bikes are always locked up, now.

The honor code is as strong as ever, but we have been
unfortunately bombarded with members of the community
who were never required to sign little white cards pledging
not to lie, cheat or, most importantly, steal.

Late—night worries on the streets of Lexington are begin-
ning to go further than avoiding police officers when carry-
ing open containers. .

At least we can now argue that no, we do not live in a
bubble.

A Word About Ethics...

Several recent issues concerning corrections, mistakes
and the omission of certain facts have brought the question
of journalistic ethics to the forefront at The Ring-tum Phi.
We have been considering the question of what, exactly, is
the journalist’s responsibility? To whom does the newspa-
per have to answer? How is a campus newspaper different
from a “regular,” or commercial, newspaper?

As a campus newspaper, more is expected of us in the area
of responsibility and ethics, but less is given to us in the realm
of remuneration. We are expected to be very careful of the
“feelings” of those about whom we write, but at the same
time, we are less well trained, monitored and paid than our
less emotional professional counterparts.

As hard as we at the Phi work to get our facts straight, and
to deal with our subjects fairly and objectively, sometimes
unavoidable errors appear. Some things which we could not
possibly have known or been expected to know have brought
us a great deal of stress and hurt feelings.

Though we have fewer resources available, a greater
standard of care is expected of us. Legally, we know that
nothing we have done or are likely to do has violated the First
Amendment in, the slightest. We are safe in this regard. But
we cannot be safe from the violent emotions of our readers;
the majority of which, ironically, are younger and less
mature, and thus, much more volatile, than the average
reader of commercial newspapers.

We have a high expectation of morality and careful
reporting at the Phi, and we do our utmost to fulﬁll it.
Unfortunately, it is not always possible to do so.

We can only hope that our readers will understand when
they are older and wiser...for now, we will continue to work
harder than you know to bring the news objectively.

Republicans kiss ’96 election good-bye

THE FAR Mﬂ)DLE

ALEX CHRISTENSEN

Hmm...Mock Convention’s Spring
Kickoff is coming up soon...I wonder
who we could get to speak here for that
once-in four-years occasion. lt’d have
tobe someone with revolutionary ideas.
A Republican, of course. Maybe even
someone who has been willing tostand
up against momentary swells of popu-
lar opinion to try to actually exert his
leadership. I know what you’re think-
ing, and I agree it’s pretty obvious:
Barry Goldwater.

What? Oh, I know he doesn’t have
the inﬂuence to shape his party’s poli-
cies anymore, despite leading a con-
servative revolution in 1964 that was
the ideological as well as practical pre-

p cursor to the Reagan Revolution, such
as it was.

If he did have that kind of inﬂuence,
maybe the Republican Party could leave
out its infamous pledge to work for a
constitutional amendment to ban abor-
tion, since it has never been paid much
attention, anyway. Maybe there
wouldn’t be such a silly, pointless de-
bate about gays in the military and so-
called “special rights” for minority
groups, which are really just rights
denied by a majority unwilling to label
itself as bigoted.

But alas, those who claim to be
Goldwater’s ideological descendants
are not so much concerned with first
principles as with gaining power. So
Goldwater’s opinions have lost. their
weight among Republicans. But hey, if
we like the guy why not bring him in?

I am making this argument because
in many ways, it is just as pointless to
bring in Jack Kemp to speak at the
Kickoff as it would to bring in Barry
Goldwater. They, the two revolution-
aries who ﬁrst invented practical con-
servatism and who translated it for
Ronald Reagan, and then shaped it
again for a new era, have been aban-
doned by their party like so much bad
seafood. And so, Jack Kemp, weary of
ﬁghting the good ﬁght alone, has bowed

out of the '96 presidential race. Unfor-
tunately, this means he has also bowed
out of relevance in the near future of
the Republican Party.

But hey, as“a highly placed source”
asked the other day, why run for Presi-
dent when you can make $30,000 a pop

just threatening to run? This is face-
tious, of course, but the point is, there
is very little reason to have an irrel-
evant player in ’96 kickoff Mock Con-
vention. That is not to say that it’s
not a tragedy that he has been
made irrelevant.

Dick Cheney and Jack Kemp have
both been make irrelevant by their dec-
larations of non-candidacy. Cheney
would have been a sharp, competent,
competitive candidate for the Republi-
cans. Kemp would have been a leader
who would have been able to transcend
party and create a new Republican
majority. But you don’t get ahead in a
party by transcending it. Not these days.
These non-candidates can say they will
be engaged in the debate all they want,
but the reality in politics is, if you’re
not willing to put it on the line, your
part of the debate is over.

The fact of Kemp’s sudden plum-
met from the most popular candidate
among delegatesto the‘ 92 convention
to idiosyncratic oddity has not been
Kemp’s doing, but the result of an
ideological drift among Republicans,
not the right, but to the fringe. It's been
several years in conling.

And now we have a crop of candi-
dates largely composed of crass politi-
cians lined up to exploit that drift to the
fringe. They say they are pro-life; this
depends on how you define it. They
say they are for cutting government;
only a few have actual ideas to make
government smaller and more respon-
sive, something at which Bill Clinton
has actually made a ﬁne start. The say
they are conservative; in reality they
are moderate in the way only career
Washingtonians can be: it’s the mod-
eration of creeping bureaucracy.

Let’s take a look at the ﬁeld as
it stands:

°Fonner Vice President Dan “Wavy
Lays” Quayle: Please! Besides all that
(you know what 1 mean) we’ve had a

rocky history with vice presidents. Be-
sides Adams, Jefferson, and Teddy
Roosevelt, Van Buren, Coolidge,

- Lyndon Johnson, Nixon, and Bush ex-

emplify the vice-president elected presi-
dent. And those guys were smart...
°Senator Phil “Prairie Earthquake”
Gramm of Texas: Nixon with a South-
em accent? This megalomaniac is wast-
ing valuable PAC money to buy off all
of the preliminary straw polls so he can
look like a contender. Bereft of ideas
and appealing to the lowest common

°Senate Majority Leader Bob “Hey
I’m hip, l’m hip: Twenty-three skidoo”
Dole: Dole would be the oldest person
elected president for the first time. He
would be a Republican LBJ,
kicking...uh...teeth and taking names.
This might or might not e good for the
country in the long run, though Dole
trying to keep Gingrich in line would
be a modern political soap opera.

So with these somewhat dim pros-
pects, how can the Republicans win?
Clinton is really not doing what could

nant unemployment, and
overbudgeting. He is pro-choice, pro-
gressive, and fiscally brilliant. Weld is
probably the only Republican besides
Bob Dole who can win and make it
stick for more than the modern politi-
cal honeymoon of about a week.

There are others who ﬁt Weld’s
qualities: former Senator Paul Tsongas
of Massachusetts, a Democrat who
placed well in the Republican New
Hampshire primary in 92, former Rep-
resentative and Labor Secretary Lynn
Martin of Pennsylvania, and Governor
Christie Todd Whitman of New Jersey
all spring to mind, but they have less
fund-raising ability and less stable po-
litical bases from which to launch suc-
cessful campaigns. All would balance
a Weld ticket in ’96...if the Republi-
cans want to win.

All would be better choices to kick
off our Mock Convention than
Jack Kemp.

DREAM LAND
Richard Weaver

I would like to state right now that I
am a winner. How do I know? I re-
ceived word in the mail this past week
from American Family Publishers. The
really big writing said: “Richard
Weaver. It’s Conﬁnned — You’re Our
New $10,000,000.00 Winner!” I didn’t
read the small writing, because, hey, if
it’s small writing, it must not be
very important.

Underneath the bulk rate stamp on
the outside of the envelope was a row
of stamps I could tear off to indicate
how I wanted to receive my payments.
I chose, naturally, 360 monthly pay-
ments of $27,777 each. Fancy Dress is
coming up soon and I want to hire my
own band to bring to the ball with me.
I also owe Columbia House
some money.

The funny thing is that I received
another letter from American Family
Publishers a few days later that said
that 1, Richard M’weaver (!), would be
receiving “ONE THOUSAND DOL-
LARS A DAY EVERY DAY FOR 30
YEARS — Right into the year 2025 to
be exact! You could sleep till noon
every day of the week and still draw
one of the biggest paychecks in the

entire State of Virginia.” Kind of
like the contractors who built
Fraternity Renaissance.

And then I got a big envelope from

read all of the stuff inside -— it looked
complicated — but I did see a form

career for myself. Forget broadcast jour-
nalism. I’m considering purchasing the
services of the less successful mem-
bers of the Jackson family and putting
the Jackson 5 back on tour, with myself
as lead singer. Though I’m not techni-
cally a part of the Jackson family,-I’ll
spend some of my money on sequins
from Wal-Mart, so I’ll fit in. Doug
Clark and the Hot Nuts will open for us
every night.

Every wealthy person needs an en-
tourage. I’m going to hire a personal
stenographer to take notes in my classes,
someone to cut in line for me at the Co-
op, someone to put cheese on my Stop-
In hot dogs, etc. My bodyguards will
pummel anyone who takes the last sau-

sage without telling the clerk to put

more on the rolling grill. In addition to
performing, Doug Clark and the Hot
Nuts will also have to follow me around.

Probably the most important thing
I’ll do with my money is plan my
upcoming Lee Chapel wedding to
Lynda Carter. I figure she's not been
doing much since she stopped being
Wonder Woman, and, hey, I’ve got
$20 million dollars. Something can
deﬁnitely be worked out.

I plan to be pretty charitable with
my money, too. I’ve already hired a
team of scientists to find a cure for the
chicken pox I gave my roommate. For
$20 million, I can be generous.

Landolphi ignores several important issues

To the editor:

Perhaps the saddest thing about Suzi
Landolphi’s presentation, “Hot, Sexy,
and Safer,” is that I sensed that she
genuinely believed that she was help-
ing her audience. Regrettably, how-
ever, her talk, due to several critical
omissions, was seriously ﬂawed.

While Landolphi did say that no
precaution was 100% effective, she
said nothing whatever about the extent
of the physical risks involved even in
protected sexual activity. When a chief
concern is the feared transmittal of a
deadly disease, it seems that the audi-
ence should be told, for example, ex-
actly what the failure rate for a condoms
is. Landolphi also said nothing about
the failure rate of contraceptives in

preventing pregnancy.

Landolphi presented a simplistic
vision of the emotional component of
sexual involvement. Based on her talk,
an undefined “love” plus consent ap-
pear to be the only relevant
criteria. I recall no mention of
genuine commitment.

There was no recognition that sex is
emotional dynamite and no discussion
of the point at which a person is ready
to handle sex emotionally. Landolphi
did acknowledge a right not to be sexu-

ally involved, but her program was '

hardly an encouragement to contem-
plation of this option by individual
students.

Landolphi several times ﬂatly as-
serted that sexual expression was “spiri-
tually” proper. She said not one word

about the sources of her view of spiri-
tuality. She said nothing about any
religious teachings pertaining to sex,
even though most of the students un-
doubtedly have some type of
religious heritage.

Landolphi stated that, while stu-
dents should feel free to engage in a
variety of sexual activities with one
another, they should wait before en-
gaging in sexual intercourse. Nothing
was said as to why they should wait, or
until when, or how. The latter omission
is ironic in view of Landolphi’s use of
“hot” in her title. She totally ignored
the fact that passions aroused by sexual
activity short of intercourse tend to
lead to intercourse itself. Given that
Landolphi is also in the business of
selling condoms (which she did dis-

close), I find her counsel of restraint
difficult to take seriously.

My position is not that
Landolphi’s presentation was com-
pletely without merit.

Herstrong condemnation of mixing
alcohol/drugs with sex was particu-
larly worthwhile. Still, the foregoing
omissions, together with the camival-
like atmosphere of the event, convince
me that the program as a whole was
more damaging than beneﬁcial. If W&L
believes that it has a responsibility to
foster meaningful discussions on is-
sues relating to student sexuality, Suzi
Landolphi’s talk failed to accomplish
this purpose.

Misprint causes dismay, 

. questions” of credibility

To the editor:

During my two and a half years at
Washington and Lee, I have been im-
pressed with the many improvements
and innovations The Ring-tum Phi has
adopted. However, there still exists a
problem which raises serious concerns
about the Phi ’s credibility: the careless
attitude adopted by the editing staff.
Last week I was dismayed to learn that
my interview in the “Talkback” sec-
tion was incorrectly written — not only
was the connotation erroneous, but the
words were not mine! Perhaps more
disturbing, the interview was altered
after it was submitted by the reporters.
How can the Phi be trusted when the
reporters are undermined by their own
staff? Unfortunately, this is not an iso-

kl . Iated incident: tales abound of students
being misrepresented by the Phi.’ At an ‘ "

institution where honor remains the
strongest tradition, I challenge the Phi

to implement better policies to ensure  '

trustworthy reports. With the capable

leadership exhibited by the executive I '7"
editor, I believe the Phi can meet this  ‘

higher standard.
Deborah Munson

Editorial Response:The Ring-tum Phi
apologizes for any confusion that may

have arisen from the misquote in 
Talkback last week We offer our as- ‘

surances that “Talkback” and every

other submission we receive is thor- ‘ “;

oughly edited and proofread When
possible, facts are checked against the
reporter ’s notes. This was possible with

“Talkback ” last week, and it was done.  "' '
The notes read as the publication did. ’ 2

Because the quote made sense, we had

no reason to believe it_was incorrect.  1

We have advised our reporters to make

sure their notes are correct, as to avoid _j. ;- .

any such confusion in the future.

A long chapter in Washington
and Lee sports concludes this
week as Verne Canfield coaches
the final two home games of his
31 year career as head men’s
basketball coach.

The 8-11 Generals will take
the floor Saturday night versus
Eastern Mennonite in their con-
tinuing ﬁght for a spot in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference

Yet, with each added losing
year, the coach felt increasing
outside pressure to step down.

“It’s been a struggle. At times
I felt very isolated,” said Canﬁeld.

The pressure apparently
reached a climax last May when,
as Canﬁeld says, he was forced
to resign. He admits he wants to
continue coaching and would
have preferred to stay on at W&L
until he felt ready to move on.

“This is not the way to go. A
man should have the right to pick
his time.”

Tournament.

Then on Monday, Canfield

will pace the Warner Center

bench for the 340th and final
time as W&L head coach.
“Next Monday, I’ll walk off
the ﬂoor with my head up,” said
Canﬁeld, the winningest coach
in Washington and Lee sports
history.

Adding to the drama, the Gen-
erals willbe meeting Randolph——
Macon College in the home-—
court finale. The Yellow Jackets
have beaten W&L 12 straight
times dating back to February 9,
1977.

The eighth——place Generals
wrap up the regular season with
three away games, the ﬁnal ob-
stacles on the road to their ﬁrst
ODAC Tournament berth since
1990-91.

It has been an odd time for a
coach that has averaged 15 wins
per year during his tenure. Eight
conference championship ban-
ners were raised in a 14 year span
that included four trips to the
Division III national tournament.

Canﬁeld’s 458 victories are
nearly half of the win total of the
program’s 87——year history.
W&L’s second—winningest
coach trails Canﬁeld by 369 wins.

The three-year playoff
drought is the longest any ODAC
team has suffered.

Emory and Henry head coach
BobJohnson remembers the pow-
erful Generals of the seventies
being a boost to the newly formed
ODAC.

“[Canﬁeld] gave the confer-
ence some credibility in the early
years,” Johnson said. “He’s been
highly respected _nationally, and
lended a level of class and re-
spect to the league.”

After taking three of the ﬁrst
four ODAC titles, W&L has
weathered 14 banner—less sea-
sons. The frustration has worn on
Canﬁeld in recent years. For a
man who suffered only four los-
ing seasons in his first 26 years at
W&L, four in a row has been a
difficult experience.

“I’ve worked through it,” he
said. “I think I’ve grown as a
person because of it.”

Johnson believes Canfield,
who he calls a mentor, has held
up well during a difﬁcult season.

“He’s maintained his dignity
and class, I think,” Johnson said.

Although Canfield will argue
that the time to step down had not
come, he leaves behind a legacy
few coaches can match.

When he arrived in 1964, the
UC-Santa Barbara graduate in-
herited a squad that had suffered
seven straight losing seasons.
W&Lwas 26 years removed from
the Blue Comets’, as they were
known, last Southern Conference
championship.

Since leaving the Southern
Conference five years before
Canﬁeld’s arrival, the Generals
totaled 29 wins. The new coach
had quite a task ahead.

“I’ve got to do more selling
than coaching this year,” Canﬁeld
told the Ring-tum Phi before
opening his first practice in 1964.

With a fast—break offense, a
pressing “goulash” defense, and
a Dixieland band to entertain the
crowd, the first—year coach
promised his team would sur-
prise, but did issue a warning.

“It’s going to take time,” he
told the Phi. “We’re not going to
end ten yearsoflosingovemight.”

W&L would wallow through
a 2-17 campaign that season,
but the real surprise came two
years later.

The 1966-67 Generals
marched to a 20—5 year and the
first of four College Athletic
Conference titles in five seasons.

That quick of a turnaround
meant a great deal to Canﬁeld.

“The players started believ-
ing in themselves,” said Canﬁeld.
“They even carried themselves
differently. You could see it in
their eyes.”

It was not the first time
Canﬁeld had turned around a los-
ing program. At Groveton High
School in Alexandria, VA, he
took over a team that had won
four games in two years. In his
six seasons before coming to
Lexington, Canfield’s teams
posted six consecutive winning
records.

Scenes like this will soon be only Warner Center memories as men’s head basketball coach Verne Canﬁeld
prepares to coach his last game in an arena that didn’t exist when he began his tenure. Canﬁeld will take
a sabbatical next year, but will remain as a tenured Physical Education instructor.

ued at W&L as the Generals
rolled to 13 straight winning sea-
sons. Along the way, W&L
picked up four CAC titles, a Vir-
ginia small college champion-
ship, a Virginia College Athletic
Association championship, and
two ODAC crowns.

W&L’s Doremus Gymna-
sium was as intimidating a place
for a visiting team as any. The
Generals dominated their home
games there and, later, at the
Warner Center.

Since the Warner Center’s
opening in 1971, the Generals
have won 70 percent of their
home games.

Even the season that finally
broke W&L’s run of winning
records brought a trophy to Lex-
ington.

The 1979--80 squad went

Basketball suffers skid;
Men drop fourth in a row

By JosHuA HESLINGA
Phi Staff Writer

Couzen and senior captain Mark Connelly led
the Generals with 17 points apiece. Dyer added 15

points, and Carter reached double figures again

with 11.

The Generals looked to break the three-game

In sports, a week is often a lifetime, and that is
certainly how the past week must seem to the men’s
basketball team as the Generals find themselves
caught in the throes of a four-game losing skid.

Just last Monday night, the Generals knocked
off Bridgewater to raise their record to 8-7. Since
then, it has been a story of heartbreaks and heart-
aches.

After last Wednesday’s crushing run—in with
Old Dominion Athletic Conference leader
Hampden-Sydney,the Generals traveled to Guilford
Saturday night.

The Generals trailed early and looked as though
they were folding when Guilford took a 14 point
lead in the second half. But in a repeat oftheireffort
against Bridgewater, the Generals came storming
back and took a 64-63 lead with 3:44 to play, after
back-to-back three-pointers from junior Derek
Carter.

Carter scored again from inside to put the Gen-
erals up by three, but this time it was not to be. The
Quakers came back to tie the game at 68 and sealed
the 75-70 victory with 7-8 shooting from the foul
line in the ﬁnal minute.

Carter led the Generals with 19 points. Sopho-
more Chris Couzen hit for 15 points, and junior
Cam Dyer added 13 points and 11 rebounds.

“We outplayed ‘them in the second half, but
we’re still learning what it takes to win and what
not to do in the last minute,” Head coach Verne
Canﬁeld commented.

Monday took W&Lto Bridgewater for a rematch
with the Eagles. This time the Generals couldn’t
repeat their late-game performance, falling 83-
72.

The Generals were down 38—37 at half time
and played competitively for most of the second
half, taking their ﬁnal lead 65-64 with 6:50 left on
a shot from downtown by Couzen.

The Eagles responded behind a game——high 33
points from Dan Rush to pull away in the ﬁnal five
minutes for the win.

hex Wednesday night as they returned to the Warner
Center with a four-game home winning streak to
face the Marlins of Virginia Wesleyan.

Things looked grim early as the Marlins took a
41-31 lead at the half, but the Generals executed
another second half tum-around to take a 58——54
lead late in the game, only to have the Marlins
manage to tie it at 58 and send the game into
overtime.

Junior Jon Coffman hit a pair of free throws to
give the Generals a 65—62 lead with 24.seoonds
left in the extra period. But the Marlins hit a three
to tie the game again at 65, and when Dyer’s shot
at the buzzer for the Generals fell short, the game
went, to a second OT.

The Generals led again 72—71 in the ﬁnal
minute of the second overtime, but W&L couldn’t
hold the lead again, as the Marlins’ Sean Blackwell
scored with nine seconds left and then blocked
Connelly’s shot to end the game in a 73--72
double OT heartbreaking loss.

Connelly led the Generals with a stellar 18
point, 18 rebound effort, and Dyer contributed 15
points and 13 rebounds.

Freshman forward Jimmy Schweer also tallied
13 points for the Generals.

The streak leaves the Generals reeling at 8-1 1,
4-9 in the ODAC.

They face Eastern Mennonite Saturday night in
the Warner Center, where they will look to break
out of the slump, and then take on Randolph-
Macon in their ﬁnal home game of the season, and
the ﬁnal home gameof head coach Verne Canﬁeld’s
illustrious 31-year career.

Every game for the Generals takes on added
importance as the ODAC tournament approaches.
The Generals are looking to make their ﬁrst ap-
pearance in the ODAC tournament since the 1989-
1990 campaign.

“The kids are continuing to play extremely
hard, sometimes not as intelligently as they should,
but that’s coming,” Canﬁeld forecasted.

“I have fonder feelings for
this squad than any other team I
have coached,” Canﬁeld said fol-
lowing the victory.

The Generals have advanced
to the ﬁnal game three times since
that season, but have come away
empty each time.

Their most recent trip came in
1988-89, when a group of sopho-
mores led the team to a 20-7
mark and a first——-place regular
season ﬁnish.

However, the following year
would be Canfield’s last trip to
the ODAC Tournament unless
the ’95 version can get there.

At whatever point the 1994-
95 season ends, W&L athletic
director Mike Walsh says a na-
tional search will officially be-
gin for the school’s ﬁrst new
basketball coach in three decades.
Walsh hopes for a decision by
April 1.

“We’ve received many inquir-
ies already,” said Walsh. “We
have 20 applications, though the
position is not officially open,

yet.”
Walsh believes that, despite
the distractions, the Generals will
ﬁnish up the season strong and
make a return trip to the ODAC
Tournament.

“I hope the team continues to
play well and the season ﬁnishes
on a good note for the players
and Coach Canﬁeld,” Walsh said.

Canfield has earned the
NCAA Division III Regional
Coach of the Year three times,
and garnered the ODAC’s
equivalent honor three times,
also.

He is planning a sabbatical
for next year, before returning as
a tenured physical education in-
structor.

Although he would like to
keep coaching and will listen to
offers, Canﬁeld says he also plans
four more years of running his
Lexington youth basketball
camps that he has operated for
over a quarter-century.

One thing he does not intend
to do next year is appear in the

Warner Center.

‘‘It won’t be the right thing to
do,” he said. “I want to see [the
players] mature, though, whether
I see it on the road or read about
it.”

At this point, Canﬁeld says he
has lost all bitterness over the
resignation. He says he has
“purged himself” of it because of
how it can consume a person.

One thing he does appear to
be bothered by, though, is the
pressure in society put on ath-

Men win at Dickinson mid-
week matchup 106-7 9

By Scorr BOOKWALTER
Phi Assistant Sports Editor

It was not an ordinary week
for the Washington and Lee
men’s swim team, but the out-
come of it cannot be disputed.

After last Saturday’s meet
with Radford was snowed out,
the Generals were faced with a
midweek three and a half hour
road trip up I—81 to face
Dickinson College in Carlisle,
Pennsylvania.

Despite leaving several swim-
mers behind due to academic
conﬂicts, W&L still managed to
return to Lexington with a sur-
prisingly easy 106-79 triumph in
its pockets.

The victory raised the Gener-
als’ season mark to 5-1.

Sophomore Davis Reed led
the way for the Generals with
two of the team’s six event victo-
ries, and assisted in a third place
ﬁnish for the 400-medley relay
team.

Head coach Paige Remillard
expressed satisfaction with the
Generals’ performance 200 miles
away from home.

“We’re glad to swim a school
such as Dickinson,” Remillard

commented. “We’re very fortu-
nate that we got strong swims
from everyone.”

He added, however, that next
year’s Dickinson meet will be
held on a weekend.

Washington and Lee wasted
no time in the starting block, as
the Generals’ men put away the
Dickinson men early. This was
due in large part to the 400-med-
ley relay team of junior Craig
Sears, freshmen Jacob Garrett
and Erik Hollbrook, and Reed,
which touched the side in a time
of 3:54.70.

Reed captured his first indi-
vidual victory in the 1000-
freestyle in 10:52.62, with fresh-
man teammate Dari Gurnon ﬁn-
ishing second. Sophomore
Nathan Hottle got his name back
in the victory column after his
1:48.23 in the 200-free, and se-
nior John Rowe dashed off to a
strong time of 4:30.69 in win-
ning the 400-individual medley.

\Only .49 seconds separated
four Generals in the 100-buttcr-
ﬂy as W&Lcaptured the top four
spots. Junior Frank Braden won
in 56.35, and was trailed by
Ilolbrook’s 56.44, freshman
Robert Mayhew’s 56.82, and
Hottle’s 56.84.

The Generals placed the top
three in the 100-free, with junior
David Stillman paving the way
in 48.69, which gave them acom-
manding 93-32 lead in the meet.

Dickinson rallied late, but to
no avail. Reed’s second victory,
in the 100-breast with a log of
1:04.97, helped W&L secure the
win.

Next on the agenda is another
tough opponent in Mary Wash-
ington, who will pay a visit to
Twombly Pool on Saturday.

Since Mary Washington and
W&L are the only Division III
programs in Virginia, and intense
rivalry has formed between the
two schools.

“It will be a very difﬁcult
meet,” Remillard said. “It will
come down to the team which is
the most focused.”

Besides being a meet the Gen-
erals desperately want to win, it
will also prepare them for the
Southern States Championships
on February 17-19.

“We have fared well against
Division I programs in the past
and it will provide us with a chal-
lenge,” Remillard mentioned.

“But right now our focus is on
every individual getting the best
time of his life.”

rdi Grs is more than a party

BY JACK THORN
Crossroads Staff Writer

For sixteen hours, I traveled
to get there. Well, actually that’s
how long it takes to get to Shreve-
port. It took another five hours to
get to the most talked about place in
the country during February.

My trip was stalled forty min-
utes because my tire blew out forty-
three miles outside of the city lim-
its. Suddenly, a man walked up to
offer his assistance. I wondered
from where he came. To my right,
there was a slimy ditch that led to
miles of swampland. To the left, I
could see nothing but my hand which
was barely three feet in front of me
and extended it to the kind man.
Before he left, he asked me one last
question. In a dialect I hadn’t heard
in months, he asked, “Are you go-
ing to New Orleans?” 1, with a
smile on my face, shook my head in
afﬁrmation.

The great spectacle I am re-
ferring to is Mardi Gras. And last
year the opportunity arose to go
during February break. The chance
only comes around every few years,
so I had to go,. Mardi Gras happens
to be one of the few times that
Northemers and Southerners, blacks
and whites, young and old party
without discrimination. Everyone

is too involved in having fun to hate.
However, this time for urbanization
is more than an excuse to drink
unlimited amounts of beer and con-
sume as many illegal drugs as you
can ﬁnd. Visitors and spectators
sometimes fail to remember that
Mardi Gras has deep religions and
seasonal significance for the people
of the Gulf Coast Region.

Depending ‘on the year,
Mardi Gras is a two-week celebra-
tion period before Lent. Mardi Gras
literally means “Fat Tuesday”, the
last day of the party season fol-
lowed by Ash Wednesday, the first
day of lent.

During the celebration pe-
riod, the streets overﬂow with ﬂoats
throwing beads, dublorms, cups, and
the like to a crowd that reaches into
the millions. You have Brouchers,
Endymion, Rex , and the Zulu
Krewes, to name a few, that annu-
ally masquerade themselves and
open the doors to their secret societ-
ies to the patrons of New Orleans.
Each of the Krewes have a ball
where the elite of the city come out
and display their wild sides. I
couldn’t begin to count how many
ﬂoats I saw. People pushing and
shoving, stretching their ﬁngertips
to the end to grab a plastic bead
necklace.

The first alleged Mardi Gras

occurred in 1705 at Fort Loris de la
Louisiana.

The soldiers and settlers at the
fort celebrated by eating, drinking,
dancing, and singing. Some wore
masks and painted their faces red to
show their festive souls. It was
almost six years later that the first
parade was incorporated to the car-
nival.

By 1718, Mardi Gras moved
to the present-day market squares in
New Orleans by order of Bienville.
The eighteenth century wasn’t com-
plete before the population of New
Orleans doubled. Remarkably, the
population was made up of nearly
60% Blacks. More free blacks were
migrating to the cities and towns
where the social life was less re-

..strictive and economic opportuni-

ties were greater.

Behind the mask, a person ’s
race couldn’t be distinguished.
Slaves, free blacks (light-complex-
ion and dark) and whites took the
Mardi Gras season as a time to over-
look social differences.

The social tension during
Mardi Gras always seems to de-
crease. Even today, blacks and
whites parade down the streets arm
in arm, laughing to an old tradition.

The festive masks and party
antics are the contributions of blacks
from Louisiana, Cuba, Trinidad, and

other Caribbean countries. Blacks
added a new ﬂair to the parade sur-
rounded by the Zulu Krewe. The
Zulus perform first on “Fat Tues-
day.” They stroll down Bourbon
Street black-freed and adorned in
wigs, grass skirts, and umbrellas.
The members of the group try to
perform traditional African songs
and dances. Mardi Gras day isn’t
the only day this Krewe comes out
from hiding. They perform through-
out the year to benefit blacks in the
area.

So for all you party goers,
take the time to go down to the
richest cultural event the south has
to offer.

Taste the food and listen to the
music of a world few think of yearly.
We Louisianaians are more than
welcome to invite you to our back-
yard and dance and party without
letting the music die.

Stores, restaurants and bars
open their doors without closing
early for three weeks to insure that
the temporary residents of New
Orleans can enjoy their stay in the
land of carnival.

Don’t forget your cigars, bal-
loons, and party hats and maybe 1,
Jack Wesley 'I'horn, will see you
dancing the jig in the middle of
Bourbon Street, letting the good
times roll.

Women's Lib is still an issue

BY PAULA Er-1-"us
Crossroads Staff Writer

The following excerpt from a
1950’s vintage home economics
textbook was obtained off the
Internet and posted on a bulletin
board in the law school. According
to the sender, “The page this text
was lifted from featrues a picture of
a ‘June Cleaver’ type-of-gal unload-
ing a full oven of food. Of course,
she is in a dress, apron, and has a
huge smile.”

“Have dinner ready: Plan
ahead, even the night before, to have
a delicious meal—on time. This is a
way of letting him know that you
have been thinking about him and
are concerned about his needs. Most
men are hungry when they come
home and the prospects of a good
meal are part of the warm welcome
needed.

Prepare yourself 2 Take 15 min-
utes to rest so you will be refreshed
when he arrives. Touch up your
makeup, put a ribbon in your hair
and be fresh looking. He has just
been with a lot of work-weary
people. Be a little gay and a little
more interesting. His boring day
may need a lift.

Clear away the clutter: Make
one last trip through the main part of
the house just before your husband
arrives, gathering up school books,
toys, paper, etc. Then run a dust
cloth over the tables. Your husband
will feel he has reached a haven of
rest and order, and it will give you a
lift, too.,

Prepare the children: Take a
few minutes to wash the children’s
hands and faces (if they are small),
comb their hair, and if necessary,
change their clothes. They are little
treasures and he would like to see
them playing the part.

Minimize all noise: At the time
of his arrival, eliminate all noise of
washer, dryer, dishwasher or
vacuum. Try to encourage the chil-
dren to be quiet. Be happy to see
him. Greet him with a warm smile
and be glad to see him.

Some don’ts: Don’t greet him
with problems or complaints. Don’t
complain if he’s late for dinner.
Count this as minor compared with
what he might have gone through
that day.

Make him comfortable: Have
him lean back in a comfortable chair
or suggest he lie down in the bed-
room. Have a cool or warm drink
ready for him. Arrange his pillow
and offer to take off his shoes. Speak
in a low, soft, soothing and pleasant
voice. Allow him to relax and un-
wind.

Listen to him:

You may have a
dozen things to tell
him, but the mo-
ment of his arrival
is not the time. Let
him talk first.

Make the
evening his: Never
complain if he
does not take you
out to dinner or
other places of en-
tertainment. In-
stead, try to under-
stand his world of
strain and pres-
sure, his need to
be home and re-
lax.

The goal: Try
to make your home
a place of peace
and order where your husband can
renew himself in body
and spirit.”

In the backlash against “politi-
cal correctness,” I have been told by
a few individuals——men, women,
and members of Congress (via the
media)—that we need to return to
the “family values’’ the 1950’s rep-
resented. Whether you respond to
the “family values” with disgust,
outrage, wistful sentimentality,
laughter, or the thought “scary” (as
was written on the bulletin board
next to the article), by now it should
be clear that as a society, WE CAN-
NOT GO BACK!

The women’s movement has
been condemned by some as the

source of nearly every social ill the
country currently faces. The con-

servative elite claim that the sky-
rocketing rates of illegitimacy, abor-
tion, teenage pregnacy, and divorce
directly result from the fact that
more women have left the world of
home and entered the world of work
(and home). The radical feminist
elite feel that women who choose to
stay home, taking care of the house
and children, are somehow contrib-
uting less than their share to society.
They claim that men are still “bad”
and women are
“ g o o d ” ;
whether you sit
or stand to pee
d e t e r m i n e s
one’s value in
the community.
Somehow in the
middle of this
political rheto-
ric, the real
value of the
women’s move-
ment has been

missed.
Thebegin-
nin g of the
women’s move-
ment is com-
monly marked
as 1963, when
Betty Freidan
published The
Feminine Mys-
tique. Although Ms. Friedan, Gloria
Steinam, and others pushed the en-
velope on sexual and gender equal-
ity, women throughtout history have
made tremendous contributions in
every field. Afew examples: Harriet
Beecher Stowe writing Uncle T om ’s
Cabin just before the Civil War;
Rosa Parks refusing to give up her
seat on the bus, sparking the Civil
Rights Movement; Susan B. An-
thony leading the fight for voting
rights; Amelia Earhart crossing the
Atlantic Ocean; Margaret Sanger
heading the Planned Parenthood
Foundation, after combatting the ini-
tial hostility of the medical profes-
sion (in the 1920’s) to birth control;
Jane Addams winning the Nobel

Prize for peace in 1931. What’s
important is not knowing these in-
dividuals and their accomplish-
ments, but rather what they repre-
sent—a refusal to be pigeonholed
by societal expectations and limita-
tions. The lesson to be learned from
these examples is that each of us has
the capacity to drastically affect our
community.AsMargaret Mead said,
“Never doubt that a small group of
thoughtful, committed citizens can
change the world. Indeed, it’s the
only thing that ever has.” The
Dictionary ofCulturalLiteracy de-
fines the women’s movement as
one “to secure legal, economic, and
social equality for women.” At the
beginning of 1995, most of the resi-
due of the previous generation’s
thinking—that equality means be-
ing just like a man, in everything
from the way we dress to our atti-
tudes toward sex and relationships——
seem to be fading. What our genera-
tion has yet to do, however, is to
define equality for ourselves.

I must admit that when doing
this article was suggested to me, I
hesitated because 17m not sure where
I fit on the spectrum of possible
labels. At the same time, however, I
think I am representative in some
ways of most women.

I believe that the true of the

women’s movement comes from
increasing the choices available to
both men and women, without judg-
ing those choices.
Whatever combination of career,
marriage and/or family an individual
chooses, it is the “right” choice, so
long as the decision is made by the
individual, in his or her own best
interest, without any outside soci-
etal pressure determining the path
to be taken.

Artificial barriers, regardless
of what stereotypes and prejudices
create them, disadvantages us all in
the long run.

We must become educated,
and offer our knowledge to others;
our genius for sitting idly, watching
injustice and prejudice fester be-
cause “it’s not my problem” could
also be our great destruction.

BY CATHERINE IAWRENCE
Crossroads Staff Writer

Already hard at work with
different events, Washington &
Lee’s newest female organization,
Women & Leadership, co-
sponsored Helen Thomas‘ speaking
in Lee Chapel last Tuesday night
and held a yogurt and coffee social
last month. And this is only the
beginning.

The organization wanted to
bring the freshmen back together
after women’s rush. The reception
for the social included a perfor-
mance by the Jubilee singing group.

Women & Leadership came
together last year when several
underclass women were invited to a
dinner for law school women stu-
dents and faculty. The underclass
women thought the dinner was so
rewarding that they hosted their own.

“We wanted to bring women
who are interested in improving their
leadership skills together to share
ideas,” said junior Karly Jennings,

“Second Proms and Second Prima-

one of the group’s members.

Just before Spring Tenn last
year 120 underclass women and sev-
eral female faculty members met
for dinner. The dinner was spon-
sored by the deans’ offices and or-
ganized by Jennings and several
Women’s Forum members.

Guinier outlines her arguments for

Party. This case from Arkansas
illustrates the problems of majority
rule. Phillips County is a rural area,
and the majority of its residents are
black; however, the majority of
voters are white. In primaries, a
candidate is required to get a major-
ity to win. If there are two white
candidates and one black candidate.
Even if the black candidate receives
a plurality of the vote, he is required
to participate in a run-off with the
person with the second highest num-
ber of votes. Whoever gets the
majority in this case is the winner

Learn from a Butterﬂy

BY KANDICE DURDEN
Crossroads Staff Writer

butterﬂy
in cocoon

sunshine beaming
heat thrusting, pulsating
sensation
butterﬂy awakens
shifts in his cradle
yearning for the light
L beckoning and calling
imminent light

butterﬂy free,
emerge in the light.

I wrote this poem to symbolize
yearning for a passion. Any passion
that drives you through physical
and mental struggle. A passion’s
empowerment so strong that you
take up the struggle for it made you
what you are—B1ack butterﬂy. It is
the struggle that made you stronger
and gave you the inspiration to per-
severe. Black butterﬂy free. And
freedom prevails at what cost? You
lose your old self, the inching cater-
pillar and become a butterﬂy whose
boundaries are unlimited.
Through the struggle limi-

tations are to be broken. You are a
beacon of determination. You, like
the caterpillar, are transfonned into
something more wonderful. It was
Frederick Douglass who said it
best, “Without struggle there is no
progress.”

This progress is exempli-
fied by African American artists.
Edward Mitchell Bannister
struggled to overcome the claim
that “while the Negro may harbor
an appreciation of art, he is unable
to produce it.” This statement em-
powered him and the struggle pur-
sued. It was this inspiration that
gave him determination and made

him the great artist he became. Like .

the figure inApproaching Storm, he
is not “overwhelmed by the forces
of nature.”

I agree with Henry Tanner
that race can be “a ghetto of isola-
tion and neglect,” but only if you let
it. Like the butterﬂy who forces the
walls of the cocoon to break away
so that he may become his true self,
African-Americans must exude de-
termination and break the bound-
aries set by racism and prejudice.
You must follow with the same at-

titude and perseverance of these Af-
rican-American artists. You must
not be overwhelmed. In keeping with
Tanner’s motto, you must “get it,
get it better or
get it worse.”
What you be-
come and
your great-
ness do not
rely upon
where you are
from orwhere
you go. It is
not Africa,
America or
Europe.‘ It is
what you
choose to
\ makeofyour-
self, how you
choose to ex-
cel and
achieve. And it is what you do for
yourself that speaks for others. The
\ artists we studied were fulfilling
personal goals. It is their personal
achievements that we celebrate, not
what they did for someone else, but
themselves. It is their accomplish-
ments despite obstacles that make

"Banjo Lesson" by Henry Owassa Tanner

them great. g
Yes, there are obstacles, but

it is up to you to decide not to be ‘

overcome. You must become a bea-
con of faith, faith
in yourself and
your abilities. You
cannot become
impeded by the
opinions of the
next man. What
counts is what you
think of yourself
and what you do
to make yourself
worthy of respect.
Life is not fair but
there is no excuse
to giving in to it.
Your will must su-
persede that which
strives to oppress
you.

You must not lose the
struggle and wastefully live the life
God gave you. It is not a matter of
choice. It is your destiny to succeed.

The walls of the cocoon were
made to be broken. Black butterﬂy,
spread your wings~—emerge into the
light.

I too sing Arnerica

BY Ronanr T/m.on
Crossroads Staff Writer

Why should there be
a black history month? All
that stuff’s in the past and
has no real place in modern
sociey. And if blacks are a
minority in American so-
ciety, why should there be
a whole month dedicated to
that race? And finally, why
be so open about black his-
tory month? It’s fine if
blacks celebrate within their
race, but why involve the
whole world or even the
whole nation for that mat-
ter when not every one is
black and not every one
cares about black history?

Well, the answers to

those questions can be
summed up in one very
simple word that every one
knows but few wish to ad-
mit they possess: ignorance.
Ignorance continues to dis-
rupt harmony both within
the race and between the
races. It causes one to ac-
cept, without questioning,
what is told to them, by ru-
mor or otherwise. Igno-
rance makes us fail miser-
ably where we might other-
wise succeed. It can darken
an otherwise bright future.
So let’s not be ignorant; let’s
learn. This February, let us
learn about that which we
know so little. We can no
longer afford to let igno-

about something so impor-
tant and so crucial as how
we feel about another per-
son or a whole race of
people. We can no longer
rely on the news and other
sources of biased media to
paint us a picure of an evil
and greedy black America,
just because we lack the
initative to find out the real
story and to get a glimpse of
what the real black person
has been doing, is doing,
and will do. We can longer
rely on the bigoted propa-
ganda of riotous, divisive
hate groups who incite.
What’s more, we can’t al-
low the visionary dream of
a black man to go fruitlessly
down the drain.

So to answer why
there should be black his-
tory month, it’s resound-
ingly obvious that it is now
more than ever that the ig-
norance of black history
must be challenged. And
it’s now more than ever that
every one, of all races, must
participate in black history
month; ignorance, like
death itself, is never selec-
tive. But if we engage in
the struggle together, we’ll
see that the success we
achieve against it is not se-
lective either.

Then maybe we ’1l see ’

all races as equal, Ameri-
cans with hopes and ambi-
tions as real as the Ameri-

can dream itself.

Reﬂections on Black History Month

BY MICHAEL HEWLEIT
Crossroads Staff Writer

I look back and wonder how we got over. Images of Africans
chained together in slave ships as the stink of death ﬂoats in the air.

The Middle Passage. Sixty million and more, said Toni
Morrison in her novel, Beloved. Those who made it landed in a land
unfamiliar to them. Questions rambled through their brains.

“Why are we here and why did they bring us here? Who are
these strange pale people.”

I’m reminded of Kunte Kinte when he arrived in America,
looking at these tuobab, or white people. In Roots, Alex Haley took
Kinte’s experiences to represent the struggles and the pain of the
black experience in America, from past to present time.

Four hundred years of struggling to become educated, to
succeed, to progress. This is why we celebrate Black History. This
is why we remember.

We remember the slaves who picked cotton and sweated in
a strange land, trying to figure out their place in a culture alien to
theirs.

Remembering Frederick Douglas who learned to read at a
time when an educated black man was a threat, a time when a black
would be punished if he dared to free his mind.

Slaveowners knew once a slave learned to read, he learned
the broader possibilities of his life.

We remember all of them, from Fannie Lou Hamer to Mary
McLeod Bethune to George Washington Carver to Marcus Garvey
to Malcolm X to Martin Luther King, Jr.. Yet, listing names
isn’t what black history is about. Black history emcompasses more
than that. Black history is my grandmother who worked wherever
and whenever to give my mother and my aunt a better life than she

had. Black history is all the black women who graduated
from historically black colleges such as Fisk but were forced to mop
ﬂoors and clean kitchens to put their children through school. Black
history is black men lynched but like Claude McKay “pressed to the
wall yet fighting back.”

That’s what black history is about. Despite slavery, Jim
Crow, lynching, or whatever obstacle, black people have surpassed,
overcome and succeeded.

The accomplishments of Daniel Hale Williams and M. J .
Walker and my hometown heroine, Maggie L. Walker speak of the
strength and the endurance of black Americans.

The soulful stirrings of jazz, blues and rap have enriched
American culture. The names of James Baldwin, Zora Neale
Hurston, Phillis Wheatley, and Ralph Ellison have taught us about
the complexities of black culture.

But more importantly, black history teaches us that these
things are possible. When I think back on my history and the
struggles I must go through as a black student on a predominantly
white college, I realize that my sojourn is a joke compared to what
my ancestors experienced.

I begin to appreciate the sacrifices they made so that I could
partake of this opportunity to expand my mind and to better myself.
It strengthens us and sustains us in the face of what seems to be
overwhelming odds.

It tells us that despite everything, we can achieve anything
through faith and determination. It gives us reason to achieve and
contribute to society.

So this month and every month afterward celebrate black
history. Not to memorize a bunch of meaningless names, but to
think about their contributions and their struggles. And how these
things relate to our life and our struggles.

Aside from attracting top
students from all across America
due impart to its prestige of being
ranked one of the best liberal arts
schools in the country, Washington
& Lee has also attracted a number of
students from foreign countries. As
a matter of fact there are approxi-
mately 60 students on this campus
who have some sort of international
background. This group includes
exchange students, here for one year
and no more than two years and
students here for four years. Such a
vast array of cultural backgrounds

should be an invitation to learn more

live in America and who does not

about a different culture that could
be vital to your line of work simply
by taking the time to get to know
them.

In fact odds are that you will
encounter someone who does not

live as Americans do in the work-
place.

Exchange students come
every year from Rikkyo University
and Kan Sai Gai Dai University in
Japan, which are two universities

that Washington and Lee has an
exchange program with. '

Some are majoring in stud-
ies that deal with America such as
American literature and others come
here to have a different experience
and learn about American culture
first hand. This year there are ex-
change students from China and
Moscow and a German student at
the law school. International Teach-
ing Assistants also attend W&L for
a year. They are short term employ-
ees who assist in teaching various
classes and also have the option to
take classes.

Divergent paths in our future

BY TIM Soorr
Crossroads Staff Writer

The National Black Lead-
ership Conference has become
as much a hallmark of the New
Year as fireworks and confetti.
This past Ianuary 8th members
of W8LL’s Minority Student As-
sociation, along with three ad-
ministrators, joined over one
thousand participants from a
myriad of higher education in-
stitutions across the nation in
the Ninth Annual NBSLD Con-
ference at the College of Will-
iam St Mary in Williamsburg,
Virginia.

The three day confer-
ence, entitled “ Divergent Paths:
Who shall Determine our Lead-

ers and Who Shall Chart our
Course? A Wake—Up Call”, con-
sisted of speeches and work-
shops on various topics ranging
from networking, graduate
school, and self—esteem to chal-
lenging racism, mentoring pro-
grams, and multiculturalism.
Freshman Nejma Petit attended
a workshop entitled “The Role
of Black Women in Society.”

“I left [the workshop]
feeling very inspired,” said Petit,
“I now have a greater sense of
what my purpose is on this
campus.”

The conference was
kicked off by motivational
speaker and talk show host Les
Brown, whose dynamic mes-

sage was to set your goals high
and perservere in pursuit of
them.

Student Activities Coor-
dinator Michelle Richardson
was particularly motivated by
Brown's statement, “someone
else's opinion of you does not
have to become your reality.”

“ The universal appeal of
the message was particularly
memorable for me," said
Richardson.

Dr. Dennis Kimbro, au-
thor and educator, rivaled Mr.
Brown for the honor of most
captivating speaker with his
speech, “Blueprints for Success."

Kimbro urged the stu-
dents to ignore the distance

between where one is and where
one wants to be.

The conference also fea-
tured speeches by talk show
host Bertice Berry, Newsweek
contributing editor Ellis Cose,
and USA Today columnist Dr.
Barbara Reynolds.

In additon to the winter
conference, the College of Wil-
liam 8:: Mary sponsors a more
intense program during the
summer which resembles the
three—day weekend. Each year
schools are invited to nominate
one student leader to attend the
Black Student Leadership

Insitute. The university spon-
sors the student if the Insti-
tute accepts that nominee.

].\/Iy Visit to the King Center

BY LAKEISHA Towmas
Crossroads Staff Writer

Interviewing for a job
was the only thing on my
mind when I went to At-
lanta in early January. Sure,
I’d take in a few sights, find
out what the city was like,
and concentrate on that one
thing alone. But then I did
something I hadn’t planned
to do - I Visited the Martin
Luther King, Jr. Center for
Nonviolent Social Change
in downtown Atlanta. I got
more than I expected.

Yes, I’d heard about
the Center and yes, I thought
it would be nice to Visit.
And I was prepared to be
historically enlightened.
That I expected. What I did
not expect was the emo-
tional reaction I later fought
hard to contain.

Walking outdoors at
the Center filled me with a
sense of awe - seeing the

eternal ﬂame that burned in
Dr. King’s memory, as well
as his tomb and the reﬂect-
ing pool that surrounded it.

Then I walked indoors.
“A Letter for Bir-
mingham Jai1”was playing
from a screen. I was moved
listening to the words. I
then walked further into the

Center and saw his legacy.
Pictures of Dr. King speak-
ing with dignitaries and

speeches and sermons, and
of him standing with such
key civil rights’ figures as
Ralph Abernathy and Jesse
Jackson. I turned the cor-
ner to see a picture of

Coretta Scott King clinging
to both her children’s and
Ralph Abernathy’s hands
after her husband’s death. I
saw the pain on her face;
the agonizing look of a
struggle she’d only begun
to fight. Behind the sad-
ness and pain lurked an in-
ner strength. I felt tears
come to my eyes.

Moving on further to
a wall where King’s life is
outlined in detail, includ-
ing childhood and family
photographs. Opposite this
wall were relics from his
life - his clerical robe from
his co-pastorship at
Ebeneezer Baptist Church
(which still stands next to
the Center), several ties and
shoes he wore along with a
business suit, a suitcase con-
taining personal belong-
ings, a sermon he wrote,
and his Bible. All of these
things were awesome from

a historical perspective, but
for me at this point it had
become more than that. I
realized these things were
part of a great man - a man
who fought for my right to
sit at the front of a bus, for
my right to shop in any store
I choose, to eat in any res-
taurant I choose, to work to
become anything I choose
to become, to study at a
school like Washington and
Lee.

Dr. King fought for
equality - my equality. He
fought a struggle so I
wouldn’t have to fight that
same segregation today.

I also realized he
fought for love and unity
not just among African-
Americans, but among all

people, no matter their na-
tional ity or the color of thier
skin.

We should all be
proud to finally have the
opportunity to set a day
aside in honor of this man.

He is not merely
someone African-Ameri-
cans should admire and re-
spect, but all people should
at least honor, respect, and
admire what he stood for.

Sadly, this is a key
point that many people to-
day seem to have forgotten.

I cannot describe to
you how culturally, so-
cially, and historically en-
riched I feel from one short
visit to this Center.

It was not only a look
into his and my past, but an
inspiration and hope for the
future.

Facts on Affirmative Action

BY Anmu-:w Hrznon
Crossroads Staff Writer

Few issues in the an-
nals of American politics
have provoked as sharp and
diverse points of views as
affirmative action. In the
United States, affirmative
action is a series of steps,
procedures, policies, and
programs designed to pre-
vent effects of past discrimi-
nation on members of mi-
nority groups due to their
age, race, religion, national
origin, or sex. It also seeks
to remedy practices that do
not intentionally discrimi-
nate but have an adverse
impact which results in mi-
norities and women being
underrepresented.

“Freedom is not
enough. You do not take a
person who, for years has
been hobbled by chains and
liberate him, bring him to
the starting line of a race
and then say ‘You are free
to compete with all others’
and still justly believe that
you have been completely
fair,” said President Lyndon
B. Johnson as he celebrated
the degree to which racial
barriers were knocked down
after the passing of the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965.

Beginning with
Lincoln’s Emancipation
Proclamation in 1863, the
thirteenth and fourteenth
amendment to the Consti-
tution, which abolished sla-
very and granted blacks citi-
zenship, and the fifteenth
amendment in 1870, which
allowed all citizens to vote
regardless of “race, color,
or previous servitude.”

Nevertheless, racial
discrimination still pre-
vailed as these new rights
were often viciously with-
held from blacks by local
governments, industries,

and organizations such as
the Ku Klux Klan. All of
this resulted in the forma-
tion of our nation’s ghettos
as blacks converged in low
income areas of major cit-
ies in search of any job they
could get.

In 1920, seventy-two
years after the birth of the
women’s suffrage move-
ment at Seneca Falls, New
York, Congress passed the
nineteenth amendment,
which allowed women to
vote. The Equal Pay Act of
1963 required equal pay
rates for both sexes but did
not legislate against dis-
crimination that prevented
women from acquiring the
same jobs in the first place.

The 1950’s and the
1960’s brought about re-
markable progress for the
Civil Rights Movement. In
1954, the Supreme Court
ruling of Brown v. Topeka
Board of Education over-
turned Plessy v. Ferguson,
which made segregation on
the basis of race legal in
1896.

The Civil Rights
Movement became affirma-
tive action, however, when
John F. Kennedy initiated
the landmark Civil Rights
Act of 1964, subsequent ex-
ecutive orders and judicial
decisions, and Lyndon B.
Johnson passed the Voting
Rights Act of 1965, which
required certain businesses
and educational institutions
that received federal funds
to develop affirmative ac-
tion programs.

The Office of Federal
Contract Compliance and
the Equal Employment Op-
portunity Commission
(EEOC) was established to
monitor them.

Gay Rights

BY STEVE Powau.
Crossroads Staff Writer

As we celebrate Black His-
tory Month this February
we reﬂect on the courage
of the African American
civil rights advocates of the
1960’s. While those civil
rights leaders’ immediate
goal was to achieve equal
rights for racial minorities,
the principle they advanced
was one of freedom and
equality for all Americans.’
In doing so they played a
major part in setting the
stage for the lesbian and
gay civil rights movement.
The modern lesbian and gay
rights movement began in
1969, when patrons of a
New York City gay bar, the
Stonewall Inn, rioted
against police who had rou-
tinely harassed them. By
doing so, they brought na-
tional attention to the idea
that America’s lesbian and
gay citizens deserve equal
protection under the law.
Since the Stonewall riots,
lesbians and gay men have
made a great deal of
progress in the area of civil
rights. TWenty—eight states
have abolished their sod-
omy laws, another seven
states have adopted legis-
lation barring discrimina-
tion based on sexual orien-
tation, and voters in the
states of Idaho and Oregon
in November rejected pro-
posed state constitutional
amendments that would
have legalized discrimina-
tion against lesbians and
gay men. Legislation to le-
galize same-sex marriages
is currently pending before
the Hawaii state legislature,
and there are currently
three openly gay members

GUINIER, from page 3’

even if the number of votes garnered by the winner to
get to the majority is less than the number of votes that
the plurality winner of the original election received.
This happens every time since the third place ﬁnisher
switches his backing to the other white candidate. Due
to the poverty and lack of public transportation, it is
extremely difficult to get the black members of the
county to participate in the runoff. In Phillips county

‘the person who gets the most votes is not necessarily the

winner.
The District Court that heard the case rejected

the arguments of the plaintiff. In their opinion they

stated, “[A] majority vote gives validation and credibil-
ity and invites acceptance; a plurality vote tends to lead
to a lack of acceptance and instability.” This is patently
untrue. Our presidential election system is on based on
plurality victory and not absolute majority.

Guinier’s support for plurality rule is what ended
her chance for conﬁrmation. Her arguments for propor-
tional elections raise some of the issues that the american
public is concerned about. In the cases of proportional
representation, voters are forced to get involved. In
recent years, we have heard much about the apathy of
the voters. In the case of proportional representation,
interest groups have an opportunity to be heard because

they can group behind a candidate that represents their
views and not depend on a candidate that represents
their views and not depend on the two official parties.
There is more room for debate since there are
more candidates. Witness what happened in the 1992
election with the entrance of Ross Perot. He mobilized
a group that obviously wanted alternatives and debate.
Another beneﬁt of proportional voting described
by Guinier ‘is the requirement that groups cooperate.
Currently in a Republican District, a politician does not
have to listen to the arguments of the other side because
he is secure in his knowledge that he will get a majority.
If there are multiple candidates that represent diverse
interests, he will need to work to build consensus in
order to win. Proportional representation would end
much of the complaints about partisanship and gridlock
in Congress. _
' Her opponents distorted these ideas about pro-
portional representation to make her appear a “quota
queen”, wanting more votes for blacks at the expense
of fairness. At the end of her article she states,
“Ultimately, however, representation and participa-
tion based on principles of proportionality are political
equality, and so the ideal of democracy itself.” She is
not an advocate of quotas, rather she advocates a voice
for all that takes into consideration all people whether

they be or majority or minority groups.

In addition to taking regular

FACTS, from page 8

As a result of this ac-
tion to provide minorities
and women with such safe
guards in employment and
education, affirmative ac-
tion has readily been criti-
cized as “reverse discrimi-
nation” (usually against
white males). Yet, in a so-
ciety where there is prefer-
ence in government jobs for
veterans, or in colleges for
the children of alumni, why
is the use of affirmative ac-
tion for minorities and
women so resented? After
all, it is naive to think that
after centuries of racism,
America — can just adopt
color-blind standards and
expect the vestiges of rac-
ism to disappear. As a
former U.S. Supreme Court
justice stated in a case dis-
puting affirmative action,
“In order to get beyond rac-
ism, we must first take ac-
count of race. There is no
other way.” Affirmative
action appears to be our only
significant counterweight to
the institution of racism.
Without it, women and mi-
norities, especially minori-
ties in the inner city, worry
that their chances for im-
proving their situation will
be lost. In addition, the
“victims of reverse dis-
crimination” can hardly ar-
gue that they do not in any
way benefit from pass dis-

A crimination against other

races and should, therefore,
reap the ill consequences of
these same benefits. Fur-
thermore, for every
opporutnity that they may
have been denied because
of affirmative action, mi-
norities and women were
denied more because of
their ethnic and/or sexual
orientation.

Regardless of the

battles for equality that were
fought and won, racism and
sexism still exist. Until an-
other applicable safe guard
is created, affirmative ac-
tion should remain, but
without the use of quotas.
Even if the benefactors have
not been suppressed by this
government in the pass, di-
versity should still be en-
couraged in all institutions.
Supreme Court Justice,
Lewis Powell confirmed
this when he stated “A farm
boy can bring something to
Harvard College that a
Bostonian cannot offer.
Similarly, a black student
can usually bring something
that a white person cannot.
The quality of the experi-
ence of all the students in
Harvard College depends
on these differences in the
background and the outlook
the students bring with
them.” However, this goal
for diversity should focus
more -on the economically
disadvantaged than it does
now on those of the middle

class.
Most important, we

need social policies that are

committed to two goals: the

~ education and economical

development of disadvan-
taged people regardless of
race, and the eradication
from our society-—through
close monitoring and sever
sanctions—of racial, ethnic,
or gender discrimination.
The disadvantaged then will
have to know and seize their
own opportunity to better
themselves, and the need
for affirmative action will
be no more. Then one day,
the dream Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. revealed in his up-
lifting “I have a Dream”
speech, of an America
where his children will be
judged solely by “the con-
tent of their character,” will
become a reality.

In spite of these achieve-

Americans do not enjoy the
same freedoms as other citi-

lesbians may legally be de-

sexual orientation. Lesbian
and gay teenagers are still
three times as likely to com-
mit suicide as

gay men and lesbians, de-
spite the fact that many hate
crimes against gay men and
lesbians are reported in Vir-

judge in 1993 denied a

she is a lesbian. She was

As with the African Ameri-

ongoing. It is our duty to
use our courts and our votes
to promote equal rights for
all Americans.

Letter on Tolerance

The typical W&L student would be more inclined
to condemn a new idea than to seek its merits. Why?
Because it is easy. This is an immature attitude, and it’s
tragic to see such laziness on a campus which supposedly
contains many of tomorrow’s leaders.

Almost everyday I hear someone slight another
because of what fraternity he belongs to. How can a

person be judged solely on a decision he made hurriedly ’

his freshman year? The fact is that the

Americans, surely, we believe that all men are created
equal. We form a more tightly knit community; we all
share a common pursuit—education; and we are free
from many of the stresses that irk people in the real world.
What stands in our way? Intolerance. There are those
among us who insist on judging others by their color of

their skin. To me, this is the mark of immaturity.
The most puzzling thing about the lack of intoler-
ance on this campus is that it practically

decision was probably made by an unin-
formed kid who was away from home for
the first time and was looking to pledge
with whomever would be nice to him.
Then again maybe it was made by some
calculating, power hungry, freshman who
wanted status and signed with the “coolest”
fraternity, putting him above the rest of his

demicysetting students question their
beliefs and challenge age-old hypoth-
eses. They tolerate their classmates’
viewpoint in class, but their open-
mindedness vanishes once off “the Hill”.
Has no one here studied the Enlighten-
ment? It is considered “good” to ques-

classmates. Neither situation seems to be
an ideal one by which to judge a man.

Next I come to the issue of race. W&L students,
like many college students across the United States, are
not tolerant of those persons of another race or culture. I
do not blame the students themselves for their blindness,
but instead I blame the framers of our Constitution.
When TJ and company failed to deal with slavery, they
condemned posterity to a hideous fate—the Civil War.
Out of our Civil War grew more hatred and intolerance
and generally led to the proliferation of racial inequality.
Racial inequality abounds in our society and is a problem
of Herculean proportions. With all the ignorance in our
country, racial equality seems like a little more than a
dream which some great man (whose birthday, embar-
rassingly enough, we did not celebrate) dreamed. How-
ever, while at W&L we are part of a unique society,
composed of people who are intelligent and educated.
Here racial equality should be easy to attain. After all, as

When I first thought of
the idea of a Black History
Month newspaper, my main
concern was producing a pub-
lication that would attract the
attention of the entire campus.
People tend to reject holidays
such as Black History Month
because they feel they are be-
ing forced to participate in
ideologies that they might not
understand. Many times too
much of one thing turns people
off. That is why I wanted to
incorporate more than just
black issues in the supplement.

our history. The argument

tion tradition. You do not have to auto-
matically accept what your father and grandfather be-
lieved. You can argue with your professors and dispute
their teachings. Hell, someone might even reward you
for coming up with something original. But if you
denounce an idea, do it only after careful contempla-
tion— not out of ignorance.

I suggest that W&L students translate some of their
intellectual maturity into social maturity. Use the cogni-
tive skills you learn in class in your life. Secondly, I ask
that some students think before they speak. This alone
may avoid much of the conﬂict caused by intolerance.
Finally, realize your self worth; you do not need to
criticize someone else to make yourself look good.

relies on the meaning of an
“X.” For most blacks the con-
federate ﬂag symbolizes ha-
tred of our people, while for
most whites it symbolizes
“southern pride.” The two
issues are in constant debate,
not only on our campus but
across the country. Many
people don’t see the confeder-
ate ﬂagsas being any different
from Malcolm X parapherna-
lia. According to some whites,
Malcolm X represents a ha-
tred of the white race, even
after his trip to Mecca. There
is a popular T-shirt that has
raised debate. It pictures a
confederate ﬂag with the cap-
tion “You wear your X, I’ll
wear mine.” The debate is

endless and perhaps pointless.

These racial debates
among our students is why I
naxned the supplement “Cross-
roads.” Each Washington and
Lee’s student body is more
culturally diverse. It is time
we stop fighting and strive to
meet each other at the “Cross-

Dorm Counselors
undergo rigorous
appllcatlon process

By BROOKE KEMPER
Phi Staff Writer

The freshman year at Washington and Lee epitomizes the
popular conception of dorm life. Cramped living quarters, com-
munal bathrooms, roommates, hallmates and Letitia Pate Evans
Dining Hall are all part of the experience at W&L. There is,
however, one thing which distinguishes W&L dorm dwelling
from that experienced at other colleges and universities: the dorm
counselor.

Unlike most schools where menacing R.A.s interact with
students on a primarily disciplinary level, the donn counselors at
W&L act as counselors and conﬁdants in addition to, but not
subordinate to, their roles as disciplinarians.

It takes a special person to fulﬁll this role. Senior Julia Podlas,
a dorm counselor of two years, shared some of the criteria for
dorm counselors. According to Podlas, candidates should be
responsible, good role models, excelling in academics, display-
ing leadership skills, demonstrating an awareness of university
policy and how to enforce it, as well as a willingness to work with
the faculty and administration if a problem with a student should
arise. Podlas claims, “an awareness of basic freshman problems
and how to handle them” and a respect for “the importance of
conﬁdentiality” are desirable attributes for prospective dorm
counselors.

An extensive, comprehensive series of essays and two per-
sonal interviews are utilized in the evaluation process. This year,
67 candidates competed for 19 positions, eight women dorm
counselors and 1 1 men dorm counselors. The pool of women and

men who initially applied was gradually decreased as interviews
were conducted and applications were reviewed. According to
Podlas, there were fewer candidates than expected.

Just what exactly is it that lures so many students to apply?
Senior two-year dorm counselor Quinn Kiley reﬂected on his
experience and motivation for applying.

“My freshman year dorm counselor was awful so I wanted to
change that.... Four people have become dorm counselors from my
freshman year hall.” .

Kiley mentioned this in addition to the obvious motivational
features of the ﬁnancial and resume building attributes associated
with the position. Dorm counselors are given free room and two-
thirds of their board expenses are covered by the university as a
result of their position.

Kiley also shared his own feelings concerning the selection
process. '

“There is no real formula [for selection].” Kiley recalled one
former dorm counselor who had a mere 2.3 but was an involved
member of SAB and football player.

“There are extremes on both sides [academic and involve-
ment].” However, Kiley said that most successful candidates are
pretty well—rounded.

It takes a unique individual to ﬁll the shoes of a dorm counselor
and this year’s candidates have clearly met this criteria. There
remains one problem in the process, however. There are simply not
enough positions for the vast number of talented applicants and this
is the reason for the comprehensive selection process.

The selection process is such that this year’s successful candi-
dates are sure to be the comforting confreres and counselors for
Washington and Lee’s class of 1999.

VMI cadets,
W&L men tangle
in Red Square

By ETHAN Knurr
AND

DAN ODENWALD

Phi Staff Writers

Virginia Military Institute ca-
dets shattered a window and pic-
ture frame in the Pi Kappa Alpha
house and smashed three chairs at
the Beta Theta Pi houselast Sat-
urday in related incidents.

Mike Young, Director of
Washington and Lee Security said
Security received calls from both
the Beta and PiKA houses around
3:20 a.m. on February 5. When
ofﬁcers arrived at the PiKA house,
they found a VMI cadet Jeffrey
Berkley in the custody of seniors
Bill Murray and Joe Tison. Of-
ﬁcers from the Lexington Police
Department had already arrived,
and arrested Berkley for destruc-
tion of property, trespassing with
intent to destroy property, and
drunk in public, according to Lex-
ington Police Chief Bruce Beard.

Tison said he and Murray were
downstairs in the television room
when the heard glass breaking
upstairs.

“We went ﬂying upstairs,” he
said. “We saw three guys run-
ning through the house. One guy
tripped and [Murray] jumped on
[him].”

“We saw a guy in front of our
door punching out a window,”
said Murray, “I started running
after him and tackled him.”

Murray pinned the cadet to the
ground by sitting on him until
ofﬁcers arrived.

“When I asked him questions
(about the incident), he kept say-
ing,‘I don’t know, I don’t know,’”

said Murray, “He had definitely
been drinking — I could smell
bourbon on his breath.”

He also noticed dried blood
on the cadet’s face.

Tison said the other two men
ran off in the direction of Stop-
In.

A print of a train given to the
PiKA brothers by their Housing
Corporation and signed by the
artist was damaged when the
frame for it was ripped apart and
the glass broken. A tall window
near the front door was also bro-
ken. Tison said the print was cut
from the broken glass and worth
about $800. The frame was worth
another $200.

At about the same time, se-
nior Christopher Lamberson saw
four people leave the Beta house
from his third floor window.
When he went downstairs, he
found nine chairs tossed around,
three of which were destroyed.

“I heard something breaking
downstairs, like something be-
ing thrown against a wall. I
looked out of the window and
saw four guys running out of the
house,” said Lamberson.

Beta House "Mother Martha
Haley said she heard “a crash of
furniture being broken” around
3:20 a.m. She did notventure out
of her apartment until Lamberson
knocked at her door. She said
Lamberson told her about the
four men, who had run in the
direction of VMI. Haley said the
three chairs had been custom
made for the house and were
damaged beyond repair. No es-
timate for the cost of replacing
the chairs was available at press
time.

FEBRUARY 10, 1995

Col. Williams, Deputy Com-
mandant of VMI, said another ca-
det has come forward to accept
responsibility for the incident. The
unnamed cadet has pledged to pay
for the damage he caused. The
cadet also received three months
of conduct probation, three months
of barracks conﬁnement, 20 de-
merits, and 75 hours of penalty
tours. Penalty tours involve
marching in front of the barracks
carrying a riﬂe.

Williams said First Class Presi-
dent Ed Randall and the Regiment
Commander apologized to the
Beta and PiKA housemothers for
the destruction.

The VMI First Class represen-
tatives also visited Murray.

They came ready with their
checkbooks ready to cover any
damages inﬂicted on the PiKA
house, said Murray.

As for an explanation to why it
happened, Williams said the un-
named cadet claimed to have come
across Berkley with and injury to
his face, possibly a cut near his
eye, and then “went on a ram-
page.”

Haley said when the cadets
spoke to her, they indicated that
the unnamed cadet had been drink-
mg.
“They (the cadets involved)
were drunk and this is what hap-
pened,” Haley said.

Williams also said that the un-
named cadet’s acceptance of re-
sponsibility for the incidents may
get all but the drunk in public
charges against Berkley dropped.
This could not be conﬁrmed at
press time. Berkley is scheduled
to be back in court on March 14.

Superdance and the Samples
draw 1000 students to Pavilion

By LORI RAMSEY
Phi Staff Writer

On Friday, February 3, Big Hairy Posse and the
Samples played at the 16th Annual Supcrdance.
Supcrdance is a benefit for the Muscular Dystrophy
Association.

Supcrdance made money from ticket sales and from
students who collected pledges and contributions to
attend the concert. Those collected $100 get in free.

Co-chair Tina Hand said that Supcrdance was “defi-
nitely successful, but we won’t know the final numbers
for about another week.” She estimated that between
900 and 1000 people attended the concert.

Co-chair Trey Block said, “this year’s
Supcrdance was more successful because the
Samples is a more popular band. Last year’s act was
David Allan Coe, who was not as popular with as
many people. This is why attendance went up.” Coe
drew about 800 people.

Hand said that they were very proud of the
ﬁnancial donations and door prize donations they
had received. Non-alcoholic beverages and food
concessionsweredonated.Concessionswerestaffed
by members of the service fraternity Alpha Phi
Omega, and the beer garden was also staffed by
volunteers.

Student security guards were paid less than
usual because the event was for charity. Hand said
“people were generous in donating their time and

money and the business community was generous in
donating products.”
Fontanne Bostic of University Services said the

event probably drew close to $20,000. She hopes W

Washington and Lee will be able to donate about
$10,000 to MDA. _

“The Samples were a huge success,” said Hand.
“They really enjoyed Washington and Lee and Lex-
ington.”

And what did concert-goers think?

‘‘I’m not a really big Samples fan, but I really
enjoyed it,” said freshman David DeMartino.

Senior John Paul Lunn said, “I thought it was
great. I especially enjoyed the single sets.”

Hillary Olson, ’97, summed up the evening:

“It was awesome!”



18-year-old
turns self in
after ﬂeeing

By MICHAEL HEWLETT
Phi Staff Writer

An 18-year-old man turned him-
self in to Lexington police Tuesday
in connection with the attempted
robbery of two Washington and Lee
students.

Police arrested Steven M. Fos-
ter of Natural Bridge at 4:50 p.m. on
Feb. 6. Foster left the state several
days after an attempted robbery on
Jan. 27. Foster's mother and attor-
ney notified police that Foster had
left the state, said Sergeant Wayne
Straub. Foster returned voluntar-
ily. He is charged with attempted
armed robbery and use of a firearm
in the commission of a felony and is
currently being held on $25,000
bondat the Rockbridge County Re-
gional Jail.

Two other teen-agers have been
arrested and charged in the case.
Because of their age, police refused
to release their names. One has been
released, and one is also being held
at Rockbridge County Regional Jail.

Foster held a sophomore at gun-
point at 8:30 Friday, Jan. 27, ac-
cording to Straub.

The sophomore had been walk-
ing to the Batcave, a house on the
corner of Randolph and Massey
streets, with two friends when a
group of eight teen-agers confronted
him. After the sophomore ignored
them, one of the teen-agers, Foster,
pulled a gun. A police car passed by
and the group ran away.

, Ashort while later, Foster pulled
a gun on the sophomore again after
taking a stereo from the Batcave.

Later that night, said Straub, the
Foster fired a gun at a freshman.
The freshman was not hit

The freshman's description of
Foster matched the sophomore's de-
scription.

Police are still investigating.

Immortal Beloved — ﬂit’

Should you see this ﬁlm? Only if you are a
big Beethoven fan.

In the same way that/Imadeus transformed

a Mozart from ‘another dead musical genius’ to

an immature, partying, very-much-alive ge-
nius,ImmortalBeloved tries to make Beethoven
a heroic ﬁgure full of passion, romance, anger,
tragedy and frustration.

After his death, his secretary Anton Schindler
(Jeroen Krabbé) uncovers a final will which
leaves all of his possessions and music to his
one true love, his “immortal beloved.”

The only problem is, Beethoven never both-
ers to state her name.

1*‘ Being a devoted servant, his secretary dili-

gently pursues all of Beethoven’s various fe-
male interests around Europe to ascertain which
was his true “immortal beloved” and thereby
honor the maestro’s last wish.

4 But not just a tale of these various pursuits,

the film becomes more and more a psychologi-
cal exposition of Beethoven’s life, exploring
his relationship with his brothers and his father,
as well as with the women.

A centerpiece is his battle with his widowed

‘ sister-in-law, the former Johanna Reiss

(Johanna ter Steege) for custody of his nephew,
Karl van Beethoven, and the erratic and pecu-
liar manner he lived in for the last years of his
life.

, Of course, as we would expect from any

’ film about Beethoven, the music always takes
center stage.

The movie’s music was directed by the
famous Sir Georg Solti, and his renditions of
the many Beethoven favorites are all moving

“ and powerful.

The film’s supposed focus is the search for
his “immortal beloved,” and the tragedy and
distress Beethoven’s relationship with her en-
gender; despite this, I found the analysis of

4 Beethoven’s deafness to be much more inter-

esting and insightful.

It is simply phenomena] to think that this
great composer never heard many of his works
performed and had no way to test them or
experiment with them — except in his own
mind.

Director Bernard Rose (who also wrote the
screenplay) highlights the anguish and frustra-
tion of his deafness through a variety of effects.

For example, during some of the musical

: performances, while we can see the orchestra

playing, the audience can hear only the beating
of Ludwig’s heart — as Beethoven himself
would have experienced it.

The result is so pitiful and despairing that
we are left thinking of the failed romance with
his “immortal beloved” as a secondary tragedy
when compared to his deafness.

Overall, though, Rose has done a rather
boring job.

The movie looks like a Masterpiece The-

1' ater special, with the exception of a few out-of-

place, artsy scenes (eg, Ludwig’s bizarre night-
time swim).

Without the power of the music, the ﬁlm
would be nothing.

,4 Gary Oldman (Dracula, TrueRomance, etc.)

does a spectacular jobvas the impetuous and
asocial composer.
With the exception of the deathbed scene,
which is melodramatic and overacted, he is
, careful to keep Beethoven’s famous passions
and outbursts under (relative) control.
Oldman is especially effective when the
film concentrates on Beethoven’s deafness and
how the pure power of his music, even though
not audible to him, helps him transcend his

1! frustration.

The marvelous Isabella Rossellini, who plays
the Countess of Erdody, is underused.

The character is too small and her ample
talent is wasted in this ﬁlm.

1 On the whole, the other supporting actors

are competent to their tasks.

Although Oldman could whip Tom Hulce’s
Mozart any day, and despite the inherent in-
trigue of Beethoven’s life, Immortal Beloved is
simply not up to the standards Amadeus set.

The script is lackluster, poorly polished and
rambling.

The whole focus of the ﬁlm, his failed
romance with his true love, is lost in the trauma
of his deafness and the power of the music.

4 The acting is ﬁne, the directing boring, the

script tedious, and the sets and costumes stun-
nrn .

gUnlike Amadeus, the film would be point-

less and unenjoyable without the great
1 soundtrack of Beethoven’s music.

However, Beethoven’s music is great, so, if
you’re a fan, you will probably enjoy Immortal
Beloved. Otherwise, I would at best recom-
mend it for rental on a night when you feel the
need to be cultured, and are drinking wine

4 instead of beer.

Most Washingon and Lee Students have just
recently started thinking about this year’s Fancy
Dress Ball, most likely in terms of getting a
date. Senior “Paducah” Joe Framptom has given
FD significantly more thought. Framptom is
Chairman of the 1995 Fancy Dress Ball.

When asked by the Phi why he wanted to be
FD Chairman, Framptom answered with his
usual candor, “God d***; I don’t know. I
honestly don’t know.”

He enjoyed working for the Steering Com-
mittee for the past two years, but didn’t want the

f

I was tearing my hair out and I kept saying,
‘There’s no way in hell I’m doing this again
next year.”’ The week applications were due,
Framptom still didn’t intend to apply for a
position.

He says, “Then on the day the applications
were due, I ended up applying, and here I am.”
Quite a big commitment for a spontaneous
decison—Framptom now spends forty to fifty
hours a week working on Fancy Dress and
predicts that it will take up even more of his
time as the big event nears. ‘

How has Framptom been spending all of
that time?

His job consists of organizing and coordi-
nating every aspect of FD. Framptom
says that he often leaves specific
detail work up to the heads of the
various committees. He gives occa-
sional advice and makes sure every-
one gets their job done.

The Fancy Dress Ball Steering
Committee has undergone a great
deal of change since Framptom has
taken over. Last year’s committee
had ﬁfty-nine people. Framptom felt
it was time to streamline.

“With that many people on the
committee, it was too cumbersome.
Because there were so many people
working, some of them felt that their
job wasn’t that important and they
would devote less time to it than they
needed to.”This year’s Steering Com-
mittee was cut by sixteen positions.
New positions were added to aid in
the organization of FD. The new
Decorations Coordinator, Ashley
Bell, oversees the decoration of all
parts of both gyms. Dan Mann has the
new position of Entertainment Coor-
dinator. He is in charge of finding
bands to play at the ball and at the

Mandela’s road
to freedom

by MICHAEL HEWLETT
Phi Staff Writer

For 27 years, Nelson Mandela
spent his life looking out of a prison
cell, not able to touch his wife or
watch his children grow up. In
America, signs reading “Free Nelson
Mandela” went up as luminaries such
as Jesse Jackson and the late Arthur
Ashe protested against the tyranni-
cal system of South African apart-
heid.

In 1990, South African president
de Klerk freed Mandela to the joy-
ous delight of freedom lovingAmeri-
cans and Africans. On April 27, 1994,
black South Africans voted for the
first time in over 300 years and
elected Mandela as the first black
South African president.

How did he feel during all those
years on Robben Island and later in
Pollsmour Maximum Security
Prison? What kind of a man could go
through so much and yet emerge
victorious and unembittered? For an-
swers to these questions, you might
want to pick up Long Walk to Free-
dom: The Autobiography of Nelson
Mandela.

Born to Thembu chief, he grows
up in the Transkei, about eight hun-
dred miles from the Cape. In the
village of Qunu, he plays with his
friends and explores nature.

When his father dies, he goes to
live with the village’s regent, Chief
Jongintaba Dalindyebo and attends
school.

Because he lived with the regent,
Mandela had the opportunity to at-
tend some of the best schools in
South Africa. Yet, at this time, he
remained unaware of the inferior po-
sition of black Africans.

When he went to college, he was
awakened by an imbongi, an oral
historian named Krune Mqhayi. The
poet spoke out against British colo-
nizers, people Mandela had grown
to admire.

“I could hardly believe my ears.
His boldness in speaking of such
delicate matters in the presence of

Dr. Wellington and other whites
seemed utterly astonishing to us. Yet
at the same time, it aroused and moti-
vated us, and began to alter my per-
ception of men like Dr. Wellington,
whom I had automatically considered
my benefactor.”

Mandela slowly became aware of
blacks’ position in society and the
need for African unity across tribal
lines. After moving to Johannesburg,
he involved himself in the Youth
Leagues of the African National Con-
gress. .

As Youth League leaders galva-
nized the stagnant ANC, Mandela
practiced law while becoming an ac-
tivist. Through the years, Mandela
would protest in the unsuccessful
Deﬁance campaigns as the South Af-
rican government implemented apart-
heid in all phases of social life.

He talks about his life as a fugitive
(The Black Pimpemel). He paints in
detail the friction between the ANC
and the Pan-African Congress. In re-
cent years, some have chosen to por-
tray Mandela as a Communist.
Mandela makes clear that while the
ANC did not support the basic tenets
of Communism, they nonetheless ac-
cepted the party’s help.

More important than his positions,
Mandela gives the reader a chance to
truly know him, his mistakes and his
victories, his pain and his joy.

The reader feels the strain of 27
years in prison on a marriage and the
sheer happiness when Mandela and
Winnie embrace after 21 years of not
touching one another.

The notion of not seeing your
child’s ﬁrst words or experiencing the
joy of your child’s graduating from
high school makes Mandela’s story
humane and touching.

Upon the close of the book, one
cannot help but marvel at the strength

Pavilion, then to its ﬁnal location in the Warner

Framptom says that “Good, big decorations
and a theme students can identify with that’s
appropriate for a formal event” are the keys to
a good FD. This year’s theme, Une Soiree
Parisienne, was chosen soon after the commit-
tee was formed.

Everyone who applied for a position on the
committee was asked to list three possible
themes, Framptom said. The themes listed were
then debated by the committee. The ones that
were most seriously considered were Peter Pan,
a casino/l.as Vegas/Monte Carlo idea, and
Monopoly.

The committee rejected Peter Pan in part
because of its similarities to last year’s Aladdin-
inspired theme. They also worried about pos-
sible copywrite problems if Peter Pan or Mo-
nopoly was used. They also thought that they
would have trouble carrying through decora-
tions in both gyms with the casino and Mo-
nopoly themes. The Paris theme seemed like
the best bet.Framptom has many good memo-
ries of theFancy Dress Balls he’s attended at
Washington and Lee.

Last year’s decorations gave him some tense
moments. He and Leo Decanini built a magic
carpet to ﬂy around the ceiling of the gym last
year. Framptom said, “The whole time, it was
in the back of our minds that something might
happen with it, that it would catch on ﬁre or fall

on everyone. Luckily there weren’t apy;--prob-.~ »f1:o_adu¢&h.,,K§_',‘,tu¢}¢y; ..h,,..,h,,,,,;,.,,,,,u,,g —of the :

Next year, Framptom plans to continue study-
ing geology at Montana State University, the
University of New Hampshire, the University
of Kentucky, or Eastern Kentucky University.
He says if that doesn’t work out, he’ll find a job,
“In the salt mines somewhere or something.”
Perhaps he can ﬁnd work in his hometown of

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

   

‘A place to call their own...

" I am going to share the wealth of my experience as a
senior at Washington and Lee University. As a fresh-
man, as a sophomore, and even up until a few months
ago, I was clueless about things like jobs and contacts
and all that wonderful stressful stuff.

Here is my pearl of advice for all of you: alumni are
a powerful and wonderful resource. Alumni are our key

vi to interviews, information and, ultimately, jobs.

Another W&L student and I visited a corporation this
week, whose CEO is a Washington and Lee graduate; he
made a point to greet us as we began our day of
interviews. A rare experience; that the CEO of one of the
15 largest investment banks in America would take the
time to meet two college students that would feel lucky
. to enter at the bottom rung of his corporation.

Washington and Lee is just that way...the experience
is so valuable that alumni greet current and former
students as partners in a special system, almost as

‘ members of a fraternity whose experience transcends
generation and even sex (unusual for a college which
was once a bastion of masculinity).

Alumni, who understand that Washington and Lee is
special, that it takes an unusual person to graduate from
the institution, are an invaluable resource. And as such,
they are both willing and able to be used as contacts,

i’ informational sources and even ways to open doors

which you may have thought were closed.

It is partly the honor system which binds alumni to us;

no one else can understand the value which we place in

‘ the moral structure of the school, and neither can “out-

siders” conceive of the importance of the traditions and
honor of Robert E. Lee to us.

Alumni are more than willing to provide information
and helpful hints to undergraduates, whether it be j ob- or
socially related, with the understanding that, when we
are alumni, we will be just as glad to help the inquiring

"‘ undergraduates of the next generation.

A testimony to the tightbond of Washington and Lee
students, past andmpresent, is the strength and perpetuity
of recruiting programs of the companies for which many
Washington and Lee students work. In almost every
case, employers have been impressed with the past
products of W&L, and are more than eager to recruit the

.4 best and brightest of this generation of students.

Take advantage of the powerful resource of alumni; it
is important to plan for your future now, no matter what
your grade. The culture of Washington and Lee is

" unique and worthy of perpetuation; the alumni under-
stand and strive to maintain this, both within and outside
of the Lexington community.

Iranian terrorism threatens West  

 
    
 

NICHOLAS L.
WADDY, ’96

One of the greatest misconceptions
about terrorism is that it is practiced
only by Moslem extremists. One need
not look far to disprove this idea, of
course, but perhaps the most powerful
counter to such a misconstrued notion
is a simple fact of history: the most
effective terrorists of the twentieth cen-
tury have not been Arabs at all, but
Israelis. It was the Israelis — or rather,
a small group of them — who brought
home to the West the full reality of the
new age of terrorism when they bombed
the King David Hotel in the years be-
fore 1948, when Palestine was still a
British mandate. The Zionists got their
Jewish state, of course, and its leaders
(some of whom had been terrorists
themselves!) would go on in later years
to use the specter of Arab terrorism to
elicit support from the West.

My point is not that either Jews or
Arabs can claim the moral high ground
on the issue of terrorism; in fact, my
point is precisely the opposite. Terror-
ism is more common than we like to
think. Parties we like to think of as
essentially innocent often resort to it,
and it certainly cannot be ascribed to
any single racial or religious group.

Having said all this, however, it is
still the case that Arab terrorism is of

American

primary concern to Westerners whose
first priority is not to defend any high
principle in particular, but to avoid
being blown up. For the British, no
doubt, a preoccupation with the dan-
gers posed by the IRA is understand-
able, but there is probably no greater
danger to the physical security of West-
em people as a whole than that posed
by Arab terrorism. The recent events
in New York City only underscore this
fact. Previously, the U.S. escaped the
brunt of terror attacks, but now even
we are fair game. The dramatic resolu-
tion to the hijacking of an Air France
jet out of Algiers, in which the terror-
ists were killed and all the passengers
saved, should not give us any false
illusions about the ease of dealing with
terrorist incidents. Once any person
makes the decision that he is willing to
trade his life to achieve certain po-
litical ends, the stakes become very
high indeed.

All this leads us to my central point.
Terrorism is not only a problem to
those who are unfortunate enough to be
affected by it personally; it is also a
major threat to the security of the West
and to the integrity of Western nations.
We recognized this fact in a-decisive
way during the Reagan administration,
when we bombed Libya to discourage
that country from supporting future
terrorist actions against the United
States. It is not entirely clear that we
weresuccessful in convincing the Liby-
ans to desist from helping terrorists kill
Americans, but at the very least we
established that there are consequences
for such action, and that the United

States would act to safeguard its citi-
zens and foremost interests.

The greatest terrorist threat to the
West no longer comes from Libya. It
comes from Iran. I have heard esti-
mates that Iran spends as much as $250
million to support various terror groups

friction, and therefore terrorism, will
play an even greater role, we must
resolve to take a strong stand against
nations which, like Iran, support ter-
rorism. The Western powers should
jointly formulate an ultimatum to Iran
that, if adhered to, would guarantee

our strategy to would insist on
date has failed; Ofthe West on precisely these
moderates have terms. The Ira-
not taken con- nian coast
trol of Iran’s should be
government, blockaded and

and money continues to ﬂow out to
terrorist organizations (just as Iranian
oil continues to ﬂow into the West).
Such a situation can no longer be
tolerated. Few states have done as
much as Iran to destabilize the political
situation in the Middle East and to
directly threaten the physical security
of Western peoples. This has all been
met with inaction or active collabora-
tion (as was the case with Oliver North)
on the part of Western countries. As
we close in on the twenty-ﬁrst century,
a century in which ethnic and religious

all military measures short of land war
should be actively considered to force
Iranian compliance.

I understand this is a radical step,
but the terrible dangers of terrorist ac-
tion in the next century make clear that
now is the time to take a resolute stand
against illegitimate forms of geopoliti-
cal intimidation. Western policy has
always been timid in its reactions to
terrorist states. The price for that ti-
midity has been high, and now is the
time to ﬁnally insist that we will no
longer pay it.

King, Malcolm X, and Thurgood Marshall who were
just as important to America’s current status as a

world leader.

As many of you know, and some probably try to
forget, February is Black History Month, and will
shortly be followed by Women’s History Month. I
can hear the groans now: “A column on forced

be no need for a Black History Month. All one needs

to know about Black History
should be encompassed in
American history.

American history is based
on the actions and ideas of many
individuals and groups of all
racial backgrounds and both

groups have contributed to our national heritage There
is no way to separate one group from the past that has
formed us all. In the same way the inﬂux of Carpetbag-
gers during Reconstruction inﬂuenced the modern
South, minorities have inﬂuenced the modern nation.
This principle may be more easily understood at a
personal level. You are your ancestors and nothing can
separate their blood and genes
from your makeup. My mother’s
family (German, Polish, Hungar-
ian, and Russian) is as much a part
of me as my father’s family (Carib,
African, and Scottish). Though
there may be ancestors I would
like to deny, they are inseparable
from me. It would be nice to deny
that any of my father’s ancestors
ever owned slaves, but lcan’t and
don’t want to. Who knows what
qualities of theirs I inherited?
All this talk of denial brings up
the question of historical revision-
ism. The most recent controversy
to make the news has been the
display of the Enola Gay. Some
believe the exhibit description was
a criticism of America, scaling
backthe numberofAmericanlives
that would have been lost should
the war have continued. Admit-
tedly, the exhibit was ﬂawed, but
an important lesson about revi-
sionism can be learned. It is better to simply present the
facts and some thoeries and let people make their own
interpretations than to try to change history and make

excuses for the past.
Black History Month has been criticized as a
scapegoat for the attempt to revise history and

make it truer to the past. During the unveiling of the

one.

National Standards for Education and new text-
books approved under those standards, there were
complaints from people that in the attempt to make
books more multicultural, they were sacriﬁcing
some of the giants of American history. One
mention of Lincoln compared to twenty of King.
Multicultural textbooks do present a problem. There
is no way to adequately include every group’s
history in the average history class. The class
would require several hours a day, seven days a
week, in order to cover simply African American
history. But there is a solution, if not the perfect

One suggestion for Black History Month is that
it should notbe only amonth, but all yearlong. To
me, that means you try to seek a balance in the
classroom. When discussing science, don’t ignore
the contributions of other groups. The above ex-
ample of a history book is unfair. Lincoln deserves
a book to himself; but, in the interest of education
there should be a move from no mention of Frederick
Douglass to at least a mention of his role in pre-
Civil War Society. I admit I have no expertise
when it comes to dealing with the history books,
but there should be a way to make them broader, so
that the first time people hear of some of these
historical ﬁgures is in middle school, not college.

It is often said that, “Those who do not know
history are doomed to repeat it.” Perhaps Gingrich
and company should take that into consideration
when they rework the budget. Instead of adding
several unneccessary billions to the defense bud-
get, they should spend some more on education. If
they do so, then the next time the name Enola Gay
comes up in a classroom, students can identify it
with the dropping of the nuclear bomb. That way,
no matter what they decide about Truman’s rea-
sons, they will know such an event should never

happen again.

Doctor of Looove adVisesVa1entine’s Day shoppers

GREEN LAND
Betsy Green

Valentine’s Day is coming soon.
It’s a time for love and romance, a time
to show your appreciation for those
who have meant so much to you.
There’s just one thing: DON’T MESS
IT UP.

If you give the wrong kind of gift for
Valentine’s Day, you are screwed, be-
cause your Valentine will be sure to
give you the perfect gift, one that is
funny, original, and romantic. That
stupid signiﬁcant other of yours has
managed to perfectly encapsulate your
relationship in one present and you got
him jumper cables. You need help.
You need me, the Doctor of Looove.

First of all, you need to ﬁgure out
the nature of your relationship with
your Valentine. Are you in a stable,
monogamous relationship? Is he the
cute guy you’ve been quietly stalking?
Is it a secret crush? (Guys, I know how
you all feel about me. Who could
blame you?) Are you “seeing each
other” and in those giddy and awkward
“getting to know you” phases? Or
maybe it’s just some random person
you hooked up with. Here’s a hint
from the Doctor of Looove: if you
didn’t bother to learn each other’s
names, you are in no way obligated to
exchange gifts.

Sometimes it’s good to work things
out in advance of the big day, like a
price range or something like that. I
decided to be direct and inform my
boyfriend that he was not to give me a
present because I’m not sending him
one, but that I do expect a card and if I
don’t get one, I’ll be really mad. He
found my honesty refreshing. I sup-
pose the typical girly thing for me to do
would be not to tell tell him what I
wanted, then get miffed when he inevi-
tably messed it up. Since I am not a girl,
but a WOMAN, this was not an issue.
But I digress. Rather than reminding
you all once more of my perfection, I
shall get to the point and help you with
a gift-giving guide from the Doctor
of Looove.

Flowers. I am a big fan of ﬂowers.

They look so pretty and you can then
call all of your friends and say fun
things like, “I got ﬂowers. Nyah, nyah.”
I am even more in favor of women
giving men ﬂowers. They don’t know
they want ﬂowers, but deep down, they
do. (Hint #43 from Doctor Looove: in
some men, this desire is deeper than in
others. Beware.) Plus it makes you
look really good. If you and Mr. Ad-
equate should some day break up, when
his next girlfriend is whining because
he never buys her ﬂowers, he can say,
“Then how come you never give me
ﬂowers like that Aphrodite that is my
ex-girlfriend did? I wonder where she
is now.” This can yield a great varia-
tion on the gift of ﬂowers: the gift of
ﬂowers from an ex-boyfriend. You’re
not going to complain——hey, they’re
ﬂowers. And your new boyfriend, with
any luck, will feel obligated to out-
ﬂower the old one. Pit them against
each other for fun and proﬁt.

Candy. Candy is the other classic
gift. Its simplicity is deceptive—candy
is too risky. If you buy it for your
girlfriend, she could think you’re try-
ing to make her fat and complacent.
Then instead of spending time with
your loving self, she’ll be busy doing
StairMaster saying things like, “An-
other 200 ﬂights of stairs and I will
have burned off that low calorie dress-
ing I put on my salad!” Should you buy
candy for your boyfriend? He’s not
going to worry about getting fat, but
you face an even greater risk: his
friends. Men have a kind of radar that
detects the presence of free food. They
will swoop down upon it in ﬂocks, like
vultures. I think Ieaming to detect and
claim free food is an important part of
ritual in most fraternities, but you didn’t
hear it from me. Worse still, if you and
your Valentine exchange candy, one of
you might be tempted to make a Forrest
Gump joke, which will basically kill
any chance of romance. Anyway, if
you think about it, when you give some-
one candy, you are basically just giv-
ing them food. If my boyfriend wants
to give me food I would much rather
have him buy me a couple chili dogs
from Stop-In. It’s so much more ro-
mantic. Instead of just handing me a
heart-shaped box of chocolates, we can

stroll to Stop-In together, hand in hand
(or have the chili dogs hand delievered
by a pledge dressed as Cupid), ﬂirt
over the nacho cheese, and offer to put
condiments on each other’s food
(“Would you like some mustard,
Pookie?” “Yes, my darling, Pickle Rel-
ish.”) Not only is it more interesting
than chocolates, it’s a whole lot cheaper.

Jewelry. Yet another old stand-by
for those who date people much more
generous than those I have ever gone
outwith (no offense, guys). If you want
to sink some bucks into Valentine’s
Day, this is the way to do it. I myself
could use a new watch or maybe some
gold earrings. Plus since it lasts longer
than ﬂowers, jew-
elry works even bet-
ter than at making
your friends j ealous.
Even this is not a
fool-proof gift. Buy

If you give the

Doctor of Looove. Don’t buy anything
that is red, has heart-shaped eyes, or
has something like “Red Hot Lover”
printed on it or a tea shirt it wears.
That’s just embarassing. Try to buy an
animal that your Valentine especially
likes. Darcey Livingston goes for pan-
das and Ashley LaForge likes trout ﬁsh
(good luck ﬁnding Ashley a stuffed
trout), but more importantly, my favor-
ite animal is the penguin.

Slutty undergarments. Again, this
is a high-risk gift, but if done right, it
could have ample rewards. Listen to
this guidance from the oracle
that is me.

Women: Tempting though it may
be, do not buy
your boyfriend
anything that
can be de-
scribed with
these words:

her a ring and it
might imply way too
much about the state
ofyourrelationship.
There’s also the
quality consider-
ation. If he wears a
Rolex, he might not
like the really cool
Mickey Mouse

wrong kind ofgiﬁfor
Valentines Day, you
are screwed because
your Valentine will
be sure to give you
the perfect giﬁ‘, one
that is funny, origi-

thong, bikini,
gold lamé,
velcro, shiny,
Chippendale’s,
p o l y e s t e r ,
naugahyde, or
Fabio-Wear.
He’s not Brad
Pitt; he’s a nice,
normal guy ina

watch you got him.
Most jewelry for
men is hideous any-
way. Women need
to take care to avoid
gold chains, anything horseshoe
shaped, and especially pinky rings. As
the wise Sarah Gilbert once said, “Never
trust a man who wears a bow tie or
pinky ring.” Exceptions can be made to
the bow tie part (see Dean Manning),
but never to the pinky rings.

Stuffed animals. So many people
buy stuffed animals for Valentine’s
Day, but I really don’t see it. Basically,
you are buying that special someone
something to sleep with when you’re
not around. I personally have never
thought that a great big bear holding a
heart is at all comparable in shape and
feel to anyone I’ve ever dated...maybe
I’ve been lucky. If you insist upon
buying your sweetheart a stuffed ani-
mal, at least follow the advice of the

nal, and romantic.

LETTERS

plaid shirt.
Your chances
of adulation
will be shot
when you start
laughing at him.

Men: As much as you might like to,
don’t buy your girlfriend anything in
any way related to the following: spurs,
tassels, control-top, Wonderbra (which
is an HV anyway), torture lacing,velcro
(it’s universally a mistake), spike heels,
the Lexington Wal-mart, leather, or
French maids. You will only succeed
in irriatting her. You must categori-
cally avoid the lovely creation that I
found in a gas station in Lexington:
women’s panites in the shape of a rose.
How on Earth could something like
that ever make it to the market? Is there
any woman in the world who would
not be underwhelmed at best to get a
pair of polyester/dacron undies folded
into a rose for the day of romance?

How could the executives of the com-
pany that sells things like that to gas
stations possibly think that anyone
would want those things? On the other
hand, let’s imagine for a moment what
kind of person would actually have the
job of CEO of Gas Station Lingerie
Distrubuters of America. Would he be
the sort of guy who has a way with
women? Probably not. Some ﬁnal all-
important advice for both sexes: buy
the correct size. You can insult some-
one by erring in either direction, so
snoop through their underwear drawer
if you must.

Perfume or cologne. As the giver
of perfume of cologne, your job is
simple. Pick out whatever you like,
give it to your sweetheart, say some-
thing like, “I bought this because it is
as seductive as you are, my dearest
love.” Your work is done. As the re-
ceiver of the the gift, your job could be
a bit more difﬁcult: you are now
obligated to wear the stuff. I don’t care
if it smells like Raid — your girlfriend

thinks it’s sexy, she wants you to wear
it, and by God, you have to wear it.
Suck it up and spray on some Eau de
Vick’s Vap-o-Rub every time he comes
over. If he or she really likes the stuff,
wearing it will eventually work in
your favor.

The card. Remember, even if you
bought him a new car, you still have to
buy a card. But look on the bright side:
this is your chance to redeem yourself
after you bought her a six-pack of beer
from a convenience store at 11:00 at
night. Now all you have to do is come
up with something that is romantic,
funny, sensititve, and sexy all in one
card. Maybe you should just buy a
blank card and add extra pages.

Don’t you all feel better now that
you have the expert guidance of the
Doctor of Looove? Okay, maybe not.
But what can I do? As Matt Groening
would say, “Love is hell.” Relax——
Valentine’s Day only comes once a
year. Have fun, follow my advice, and
stay away from underwear roses.

Christensen overlooks America’s right turn, Kemp 's many virtues

To the editor:

In last week’s edition of The Ring-
tum Phi, Alex Christensen disputed
Mock Convention’s decision to have
Jack Kemp for its Spring Kickoff. It

was his belief that a moderate Repub- ,

lican, such as Massachusetts Governor
William Weld, would have been a bet-
ter choice. Only a Republican who is
“pro-choice, socially moderate, and
ﬁscally conservative,” Mr. Christensen
contends, has any chance of winning in
November. By bringing a moderate
Republican for Spring Kickoff, the
Mock Convention would better repre-
sent the interests of the Party.

On behalf of Mock Convention, I
want to encourage further thought pro-
voking debate. The Republican Party
over the last thirty years has trans-
formed itself into the party of ideas. It
has been on the cutting edge of intel-

lectual thought and its recent successes
could not have occurred without it. In
an attempt to emulate the Republican
Party’s passion for ideas, the Mock
Convention would like to encourage
the entire student body to actively par-
ticipate in debating not only whom the
Party should nominate, but also the
platfonn it should adopt.Although Mr.
Christensen makes a notable contribu-
tion to the great debate that is part of the
Mock Convention, his ideas concem-
ing Kemp and moderate Republicans
are on the fringe of the party. He is
correct in maintaining the nominee must
be “someone with revolutionary ideas.”
The question, though is what type of
ideas. Mr. Christensen proposes adopt-
ing some of the most radical and con-
troversial positions in American poli-
tics. He suggests removing the ban on
gays in the military, hints at ending
opposition to Afﬁrmative Action, and

reversing the party’s pro-life stance.
Unfortunately, Mr. Christensen ne-
glects the fact that America over the
last 15 years has moved signiﬁcantly
to the right. Moderate Republican presi-
dential candidates are dinosaurs in the
current political environment. On ﬁs-
cal issues, as Mr. Christensen correctly
points out, the nation demands lower
taxes, fewer government programs, and
less burdensome regulations. The
American people are also more con-
servative on social issues. They refuse
to allow for public funding of abortion,
call for the abolition of Affirmative
Action, and staunchly support family
values. America is fundamentally a
conservative nation and any candidate
who attempts to ignore this fact is
destined for failure.

Jack Kemp was our choice for the
Spring Kickoff because he played a
signiﬁcant role in developing the Re-

TALKBACK

 

publican Party into a majority party.
Without the groundwork laid by Jack
Kemp and Ronald Reagan, the Repub-
lican would not have control of both
houses of Congress for the ﬁrst time in
40 years. He transfomied the Party from
one consisting of “lukewarm liberals”
who merely wanted to make sure the
government did not bankrupt the na-
tion into one of “strong conservatives”
who believe in markets, individualism
and entrepreneurship.

Kemp was one of the Republicans to
see the Party as the majority party. By
reaching out to blue-collar workers and
blacks, he helped build the majorities
which led to three consecutive Presi-
dential wins and eventually to control
of Congress.

While Kemp has been instrumental
in helping the Republican Party achieve
its recent successes, he is not without
his faults. As David Frum, author of

DeadRight, has shown, Kemp’s deter-
mination to lower taxes is not matched
by his energy to reduce government.
During his term as HUD Secretary,
Kemp increased its budget from $19.7
million to $28.1 billion in four years.
Frum correctly points out , in a recent
Wall StreetJournal editorial, the lack
of support for a Kemp presidential run
came from a “new determination
among Republicans to cut the federal
government down to size.”

Kemp will not be the nominee be-
cause he has not shown the willingness
to cut government to the degree de-
manded by the mainstream Republi-
can party.

Despite his decision to opt out of
the presidential race, Kemp remains
an important ﬁgure in the Party and
continues to have tremendous inﬂu-
ence on the course of its future. Re-
cently, he fought against Califomia’s

Proposition 187, in an attempt to pre-
vent the party from becoming the “na-
tivist” and “protectionist” party.

The Mock Convention is fortunate
to have a man as knowledgeable and
inﬂuential as Jack Kemp for its Spring
Kickoff. He has been a key player in
developing the modern Republican
Party and will remain an important
ﬁgure in American politics.

While Kemp may not be running
for president, he is still a prominent
American statesman. As Nwional Re-
view put it, “he joins Bryan, Clay, and
(yes) Hamilton on the short list of poli-
ticians who affected the country more
than many of the eminences we cel-
ebrate on President’s Day.”

One Lexington Under A Groove

By Richard Weaver

Special to the Phi

They call him the Presi-
dent of Funk, and for more
than three decades George
Clinton has deﬁned the cut-
ting edge of music. As the
leader of Parliament,
Funkadelic, and groups
combined, he’s topped the
charts with such classics as
“Up for the Down Stroke,”
“Chocolate City” and “One
Nation Under A Groove.”

Clinton has toured all
overthe world and on March
2, he’ll be in Lexington, on
business. Parliament isn’t a
bunch of blow-dried croon-
ers —— it’s a crazy collection
of souls from all over the
galaxy, on stage to perform
viaThe Mothership Connec-
tion.

With his feathers, braids,
and face paint, George
Clinton is deﬁnitely not your
average singer; in his songs,
he says he wants to “do it to
you in your earhole.”

I spoke with the presi-
dent several days ago about
the state of the union:

I understand you were
recently on vacation —
where did you go?

The Virgin Islands. It was
the first time I had a chance
in 8 or 9 years to go ﬁshing.
I caught a 75-pound dolphin
and 50-pound wahoo, and
we ate that. They tried to
smoke the dolphin and do a
skin mount but it was a little
too old for that s“**; he
seemed prehistoric. Bootsy
[Collins] and I used to go
ﬁshin,’ mainly so you could
just chill out and forget
about everything.

I also went to St. Thomas
— it’s like 1967 or 1968
there. You go and hang out
in the parks and the com-
munes; there are the same
kind of vibes.

Goats and s*** walk in
the street, but don’t you blow
your horn at them. They
don’t go for that s“”. Ev-
erything moves slow there
— it’s real laid back there;
thereain’tnobodylivingfast
there. They thrill about that

Sit!‘

What have you been
working on recently?

l’ve done some work for
Sony with Dallas Austin. We
just did something for the
Black Panther soundtrack.
The movie’s about the be-
ginning of the Black Pan-
thers. Mario Van Peebles is
producing it; it will be out
next month. Austin got all
of the soulful girls he could
ﬁnd to sing on this record —
all the divas — singing
their asses off. It sounded
pretty good.

Real soon I’m going to
do some stuff with Pearl Jam
and Rage Against the Ma-
chine. I’ve been wanting to
work with Eddie [Vedder]
for a long time; we met at
the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame. He’s one of the few
musicians I met who’s truly
a spacechild —- he’s got it
authentically. You look at
him on stage and he looks
like he’s out of his mind and
he’s got a gallon of whiskey
in him. He is actually a good
singer, damn, he could sing
pop standards if he was into
that. When I heard him, I
said ‘This motherf"“"“"can
really sing.’

Haveyouthoughtabout
getting more involved in
movies?

Just slightly here and
there — I want to do The
Mothership Connection
movie. For now I do them
[movies] in context with
what we‘re doing. If it’s me
being able to be me, I can do
it better, but with how I look,
it can confuse some people.
In PCU, it was like Otis Day
and the Knights in Animal
House — we were able to be
ourselves. They actually
should have used the foot-
age for a concert ﬁlm like
Purple Rain. The movie
would have had a bigger hit.
It would be one of those
things you would rent for-
ever.

We had such a party -—
we played live on the set; the

people loved the show. They
people really did jam and
the dialogue was going along
while we were playing. But
the editing of a movie is like
remixing a record — the
people who remix are a little
differentthanthepeoplewho
remix records. They ought
to remix movies. A good
movie to remix would be
Grafﬁti Bridge [the sequel
to Purple Rain]. If they
would have kept the s"‘"
the way they had it, it would
have been ﬁne. But they
f""“" it up. It was a nice
movie, but it turned out
pretty lame. Those good-
guy, bad-guy things — they
always work. Star Wars was
regular cowboys and Indi-
ans.

How did the closing of

Paisley Park Records and
Prince’s troubles with
Warner Brothers Records
affect you?
[C I i n to n
was signed
with Pais-
ley Park].

We still
don’t know
what hap-
pened with
the hit
record [Hey
Man, Smell
MyFinger].
It was sell-
ing like a
"Mill!
and wewent
to work one
day and the
record com-
pany doors
w e r e
locked. I
don’tknow.
He [Prince]
p r o b a b I y
knows him-
self. Usu-
ally the tab-
Ioids would
be all over
this s“ * ' ,
but they haven't said s““
about this.

When they didn’t talk
about it, it lead me to think it
wasdeeper.Thiswholething
chased him [Prince] back un-
derground. The fans were
trying to take him there any-
way. He doesn’t have to be
pop creation.

This way you call the 800
numberto get his new record
and you appreciate it more
that way. We got a 900 num-
ber funk thing to get rare
records, like DopeDogs. It's
the best record we’ve done
in 20 years.

Do you think it’s rac-
ism that Prince is dealing
with?

Hell, yeah, it goes with-
out saying. It’s part of the
thing. He might have for-
gotten it because he was a
pop star. It was rudely
thrown in his face. They took
my record out of print com-
pletely. He had to be having
some kind of serious s"**.
They [Warner Bros.] were
mad because he fulﬁlled his
contract but they didn’t like
how he did it.

You've spoken before

about a phenomenon
called the New World
Odor. What is that?

it’s part of the vibe—the
thing now is to have as many
conﬂicts as possible. People
don’t get it; it’s not just ordi-
nary conﬂicts like black and
white. You’re more apt to

get pro- or anti-abortion to
go crazy or gay and straight
or animal rights people. You
probably would get them to
ﬁght over each other. All of
these weird phenomena
scare the s"”" out of the
people. People say, ‘Kook
here’ or ‘kook there.’ Same
thing in the record business;
when you get to be in real
business you get to be a
kook— you don’t want to
change.

All of it is a big corpora-
tion, but whatever happened
to ourselves, we still sell out
even without a hit record. It
tookalongtime foroneoom-
pany to ﬁgure out something
we already knew. The rest
of the record companies kept
making us make demos. You
can’t hurt my feelings with
that, but the people around
me are screaming about how
I should have to do demos.
My attitude is this: F“ * me.

I won’t
live off
just one
record. I
want to
m a k e

indictments are a good ex-
ample — it’s done to an-
tagonize somebody. It’s not
just to get even; it’s just to
piss you off.

The media can push it in
such away as to make people
react. There is a dynamic to
get people to do s‘". The
ﬁrst ghetto law is to play the

desires and not get hurt.

They try to make the
whole rapthingasanexcuse
for spouse abuse. They try
to say that anger is coming
from the artist, but artists
only reflect the time; they
only paint pictures that are
already there. The new thing
is to put the deﬁnitions on a
negative standpoint. All of
those talk shows get out there
and start interpreting and
they give no one else a
chance to talk. That s"‘ is
gossip. Rap gets to some
earholes too.

While they’re macking
and gawking, my one thing
is that I had to see it used
against the cops - they got it
just as bad as the kids got it.

.When it comes time to train

them, they can brainwash
them to protect the system,
not necessarily the people.
They’re afraid from the be-
ginning, and they don’t pay
them enough money to die
for that s***.

The cops have been set
up too, with their training of
brotherhood They’re over-
seers and are responsible for
dealing with it in front of the
TV.

How do you feel about
performing in a town they
called “The Graveyard of
the Confederacy?” —
Robert E. Lee and Stone-
wall Jackson are buried
here.

No s* * *, l;ee’s buried on
campus? God****, that’s
deep. That whole time pe-
riod is getting ready to be
repeated. I realize how much
history is manipulated, with-
out a care. The constitutional
patriots in Middle America
will have a rude awakening.

All of the people in the
South — they’re the ones
I’m scared of. They need to
know they don’t have to tear
the place up; just vote the
motherf"**"s out. In
Middle America it will be
chaotic because they will
play it as a white thing. They

I’m glad we’re getting a

, 

Any special French occasion calls for the
ultimately sensuous French experience: an
expensive, rich, freshly-cooked meal. The
ingredients must be carefully chosen and
handled; the directions must be followed
precisely, but with a creative ﬂair that will
make the meal your own. I have crafted a
meal that will send even the snottiest Pari-
sian into foolish slobbering paroxysms of
culinary joy. (Don’t worry, I tested this
meal on the pickiest eater I know. His exact
words of praise and adulation were, “That
was good”) Eat in good health and teach
your date the phrase, Le repas était délicieux.

Homard aux Crevettes Jaune avec Riz
Citron

(Lobster tail and shrimp with a yellow
cream sauce and lemon rice)

2 lobster tails

1/2 lb large shrimp (about 10)

2 shallots, minced

2 tsp. minced fresh ginger root,(next to
the shallots at Harris Teeter)

pinch saffron threads (about 1/8 tea-
spoon)

1/2 cup dry white wine

1-2 cups seafood stock (use chicken or
vegetable broth or call me ifyou cannot find
seafood stock)

1 cup heavy cream

own

unsalted butter (not margarine)

1/2 cup white rice (basmati works best
here)

1 tbsp. fresh-squeezed lemon juice

1 tsp. zest of lemon (grate the lemon peel

’ so that just the yellow part is used)

°In a small saucepan, melt about 2 tsp.
butter and add one of the shallots; cook over
medium heat until translucent, about 4 min-
utes. Add rice, lemon juice, and lemon zest,
and toss until rice is coated with butter; add 1
1/2 cups cold water and bring to boil. Lower
heat to medium low and cover; simmer 20
minutes, until liquid is absorbed. Set aside.

°In a sauté pan, melt 1 tbsp. butter and add
remaining shallot and ginger; cook over me-
dium heat until shallots are tender, about 4
minutes. Add saffron, wine, and 1 cup sea-
food stock; cook over medium heat until most
of the liquid is evaporated. Add more seafood
stock and reduce again until you have about 2
tbsp. liquid; add cream and reduce
heat to very low; stir until heated and
slightly thickened.

-Rinse and peel shrimp and lobster tails;
cook in boiling salted water and remove when
cooked through. The shrimp will take 1-2
minutes (take care not to overcook shrimp)
and the lobster, 5-10 depending on the size of
the tails.

°On two heated plates, heap 1/2 cup of rice
in center. Set a lobster tail on each heap;
surround with 5-7 shrimp. Pour cream sauce
over lobster and rice mounds so that plate is
mostly covered.

I accompanied this meal with button mush-
rooms sautéed in butter; another good French
accompaniment would be fresh steamed as-

paragus (cook in a large covered saucepan
with about 1 inch of water for about
8 minutes).

For dessert, the ubiquitous French ﬁn-
ish is creme brulée. I am far too snobby to
translate this; really good creme brulée
does not fit any translation, and this, pre-
pared carefully enough, is the best in
the world.

Creme Brulée

3 egg yolks (make sure you remove
absolutely all of the whites)

1 cup heavy cream

2 tbsp. granulated sugar

2 tsp. vanilla (not imitation; if you can
get a vanilla bean, it would work better;
simply split the bean in two and scrape the
seeds into the mixture when the directions
call for vanilla)

brown sugar

-Over low heat, cook the cream and 1
tbsp. granulated sugar until the mixture is
almost to the boiling point but do not boil.
Remove from heat immediately.

‘In small bowl (I use a 2-cup Pyrex
measuring cup) beat yolks and remaining
tbsp sugar briskly.

°Very slowly add cream to yolks,
whisking constantly and briskly. If you
add the hot cream too quickly, you will
have scrambled eggs and cream. When all
the cream is incorporated, mix in
the vanilla.

_ °Strain mixture into another bowl (this
is where the pour spout on the measuring
cup comes in handy) through a very fine

best). This takes patience, but is well

worth the effort.

°Pour strained mixture into 4 4-ounce
ceramic custard cups. The best ones for this
recipe are the true French creme brulée
cups, which are about 1 inch high and about
4 inches in diameter. These are, however,
almost impossible to find, so the traditional
custard cups which are much taller and
fatter will work fine. Bake on a cookie sheet
onto which you have poured cold water
which comes about halfway up the sides of
the cups (you can also use a deeper baking
pan) at 350° for about 20 minutes;
if the surface begins to brown,
remove immediately.

Cool and refrigerate for at least 4 hours,
preferably overnight.

‘When ready to serve, turn your oven to
broil and spread about 1-2 tbsp. brown sugar
over the top of the creme brulées. Broil
close to heat until brown sugar bubbles and
caramelizes. Remove and serve with
a spoon.

These recipes and others will appear in
my soon—to-be published cookbook, which
Betsy Green thinks I should call Cooking
with Alcohol;Anne is holding out for Spiri-
tual Cooking, and it may also be called The
Single Entertainer. All recipes are copy-
righted and may not be reprinted under
any circumstances.

And, if the recipes defeat you, check out
our dining guide in this supplement or call

It’s getting to be that time...the traditional week of Fancy
Dress Ball is right around the corner! So what plans have
you made? Naturally, thanks to SAB and the FD Steering
Committee, we will be entertained both Thursday night,
when George Clinton and the P-Funk All-Stars comes to the

Pavilion, and Friday night, when the ball begins at 9:30. So
what about the rest of the time? There will be fraternity
parties, fraternity parties, and...well...more fraternity par-
ties, most of which are generallyopen later in the evening.
But there is still the problem of dinner. Naturally, there
many wonderful resturants in town and in the surrounding
areas (see the dining guide, page 8, for more information).
And most fraternities will have formal dinners of their own.
So where does that leave those who are not Greek? This
year, there is an option. 9

George Clinton and the P-Funk All-Stars
will come to the stage of the Student Activi-
ties Pavilion on Thursday, March 3, to per-
form their “free-form funk symphony” for
W&L students.

The band, known for outrageous cos-
turning and showy performances, is sure to
bring excitement to the Pavilion. Clinton
thrives on audience participation, allowing
the level of the show to rely on the crowd’s
enthusiasm. According to RollingStone“lt’s
not hard to get caught up in the fever of a P-
Funk show. Everything from the band mem-
bers’ costumes to the deep, uncut jam-ori-
ented funk the purvey invites abandon.”

Eric Scott, who saw the band last
weekend at Buffalo State College in New
York said, “George Clinton is fantastic. He

5 to all tastes  

and his P-Funk All-Stars put on one of the
groovingest shows I have ever seen...it is
unlike any other group, mainly because of
the huge amount of people on stage at one
time.” According to Scott, at any time, there
is at least one bass, two to four guitars, a
drummer, and assorted singers; there is also
a compliment of horn players on many
songs, who add to the mix considerably.

Frank Moscowitz, who also saw P-Funk
last weekend at Buffalo State, describes the
atmosphere of the show by saying, “This
concert experience was definitely [new] for
me...the stage presence at the show was
different...it was more casual and had its
share of movement.”

P-Funk pleases every musical tastes,
according to Scott, from “deadheads like
myself,” to rap, reggae, and rock fans, all of
whom were present at the show he and
Moscowitz attended. The show, which will
officially kick off FD Weekend promises to

, be fun and exciting for all in attendance.

Moscowitz called the show “a thoroughly
enjoyable experience,” and Scott said it was
“definitely one I’d recommend catching.”

Bo Thorpe and his orchestra will play
Fancy Dress for the third year in a row.
Thorpe, a native of Rocky Mount, North
Carolina, has moved all around the country,
and held a great variety of jobs. Thorpe
worked as an investigative reporter, soldier,
and communications consultant to the Fed-
eral Government; he even ran for Congress
before ﬁnding his calling in music and found-

ing his orchestra in 1978. Thorpe and his
orchestra play everything from Gershwin to
“Disco Duck Revisited”, creating an eclec-

is very dancable, and promises to keep feet
tapping. Thorpe has played at the Univer-
sity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the
United States Military Academy, and the
last four Presidential Inaugural Balls.

In 1895, Annie Jo White was appointed
university librarian at Washington and Lee.
Before her retirement in 1928, her contribu-
tion to the university and its students went
beyond increasing the number of hours
that the library was open and expanding
its collection.

In 1907 “Miss Annie Jo”, as White was

Washington and Lee is doubtless a school
that has a love affair with tradition; one of
the most cherished traditions is certainly the
Fancy Dress Ball.

As the 88th Ball nears, many compari-
sons will be made to previous galas, even
those that took place long before the time of
any present student.However, comparisons
are difficult when considering the number
ofchanges the W&L Fancy Dress has un-
dergone since its origin.

Eventhis long-standing tradition has had
many facelifts.Fancy costumes were the
normal attire decades before black tie. In
1969, the event suffered its greatest change,
brieﬂy becoming a tie—dye affair!

The most obvious change is undoubt-
edly the price of admission. ltwas free.
Well, at least Annie Jo White’s first gala in
1907 wasa freebi,e except for the $2 charge
for constumes.Annie’s spare $44, half the
price of today’s tickets, paid for theentire
event. A VMI orchestra provided the enter-
tainment longbefore Bo Thorpe was
born.Despite the bargain price the ﬁrst ball
was organized with, the event left a similar
impression on attendees as it does today,
moving one onlooker to note, “This beats
anything I ever saw.”This new Bal Masque
was aninstanthitamongstudentsand quickly
became an annual attraction. However, it
was not quite yet a hit with the administra-
tion. The school refused to turn the ball into
a holiday and continued to hold 9 am Satur-
day classes on the next day.This held until
1923, when Fancy Dress was moved from
its February time slot to January, during
what was then the mid-semester break.

Two decades into the “costume ball” its
popularity skyrocketed.Thousands of people
attended, with young women often renting
entire boxcars on trains from around the
region to Lexington. Newspapers from New
York to Texas reported on and reviewed the
ball. It was soon carried across the country
by national radio networks, reaching its

affectionately called, and several students
used forty four dollars remaining from the
theater production proceeds to create the
ﬁrst Fancy Dress Ball.

The charter theme for that ﬁrst FD was
Bal Masque. Instead of wearin g dresses and
tuxedos, students donned two dollar cos-
tumes and spent the night two-stepping
to the tunes of the Virginia Military
Institute Orchestra.

White’s efforts to establish what she
hoped would become an annual social event
were met with some resistance. At first, the
idea of the Bal Masque was greeted with
indifference by the students. University

despite adversity

height in exposure.The New York Times
was moved to label Fancy Dress the “out-
standing collegiate social event of the
South.”

The orchastras and bands grew in stat-
ure, as well. Duke Ellington, Count Basie,
Bennie Goodman, and Jimmy Dorsey all
entertained the crowd at some time.

The ball was not entirely without a few
bumps in the road. In 1919, thestudent
body, holding to its traditionally conserva-
tive views, passed a resoluation denouncing
“all distasteful and exaggerated forms of
dancing, such as the shimmy.”

Later, cost became a source of com-
plaint. In 1936, the 60 cent raise in prices
brought outcry from the students.

The Fancy Dress Ball’s biggest crisis
came in the early ’70s.ln 1970, the school
calendar was changed, moving the end of
the fall semester from January to late De-
cember, just before the Christmas vacation.
Without being able to hold the gala during
the mid-semester break, and due to the
“greatly reduced budget” of the Dance
Board, Fancy Dress was scrapped. It died a
“silent death” according to The Ring—tum
Phi that year.In its place, a concert by The
Allman Brothers Band was held in Doremus
‘Gymnasium, followed two years later by
Sha Na Na. For the first time since World
War II, Annie’s ball was not held.

In ’74, it returned with much fanfare,
including the dumping of a pitcher of beer
over the head of W&L President
RobertHuntley.The themethat year was to
be “Land of Oz,” but just two weeks before
the ball, the IFC changed it to “Mardi Gras,”
the same theme as in ’54 and ’64. Dress was
semi—formal, but by the end of the decade
FD would permantly become a black tie
affair.

Themes such as “Passport to Paris” and
“Glories of Egypt” symbolized the ball’s
return to its earlier “high society” feel.
“Proper attire” was now requested so as to
avoid upsetting the doorman.

As Washington & Lee nears its 250th
birthday, the Fancy Dress Ball is now seem-
ingly a permantly entrenched tradition.
Though it hastravelled a long road since that
first $44, Annie’s ball is stillenjoyed by the
school she cared so much about.

president Henry L. Smith had to prevent a
grand jury from indicting White, who had
tried to purchase rum and scotch for the
event through the mail, in violation of
Prohibition law.

Hercontributions to W&Ltradition have
earned Annie Jo White the honor of having
Leybum Library’s computerized card cata-

creates Ba! Maque with $44

log named after her. University librarian
Barbara Brown stated that “Annie” was
chosen because it was short, easy to pro-
nounce and spell, and because it had signiﬁ-
cant W&L connections. Brown also said
that, “...More importantly, it is appropriate
that we honor a woman who was such a
friend to students.”

Une Soiree Parisienne. Though the
name is new, the concept is familiar, and as
with most Fancy Dress themes throughout
the years, it has a long line of esteemed
precursors.

The most recent occurrence of a similar
theme was 1977, when the FD committee
chose “Passport to Paris” as its theme.

The oldest was 1916, when FD first
departed from its early tradition of having
either “Bal Masque” or “Colonial America”
as its theme; the name of the ball that year
was “Court of Louis XIV.”

In 1918, the theme was somewhat simi-
lar and very intricate: “Europe and Colum-

bia, the Gem of the Ocean.” In 1926, the '

FD committee chose its theme in French:
“Bal Beaux Arts.”

Options are endless for successful FD themes

GREEN LAND
BETSY GREEN

The secret is out. The theme for the 1995
Fancy Dress Ball is Une Saree Paressiene.
I have to say, it has potential. French
impressionist paintings, chateaus, and side-
walk aritists will surely transform our gym
in to something tres bien. The possibilities
are endless. Remember the belly dancers
(all of whom had probably had at least four
children) who wandered around last year’s
FD? If the steering committee has any hopes
of making this French

Evening in Lexington: Wow, what a fun
FD theme! Everyone gets really drunk then
spends the night in jail. Oh, wait...that could
happen any weekend.
Inside the Human Liver: Let’s prove to
our professors that FD can be both fun and
educational. No

thing authentic, they
will feature strolling
rude waiters at this
year’s ball. But what if
the FD committee
hadn’t chosen Frenchy
Dress Ball? Think of all
of the FD themes that
could have been (make
cool Wayne’s World
ﬂashback noises now)...

FD chairman
Paducah Joe Framptom
was really tom when it
came to choosing this
year’s theme. A long-
time favorite of Joe’s is
Great Social Purges of
the Twentieth Century.
The Warner Center
would be transformed
into Bosnia-Hertzogovinia, and heaven only
knows what else.

Joe was also considering Great Maritime
Disasters. Dance with your date in the small
gym made to look just like the Exxon-
Valdez debaucle, but beware of the slick
spots! Then stroll over to the big gym, The
Wreck of the Titantic, or And the B0 Thorpe
Orchestra Played On. You have to love the
creative genius that is Paducah Joe. Here are
some other possilbe themes.

Reliving Your High School Prom:
Everyone’s parents come to Lexington to
drive them to the ball and pick them up
afterwards. The Warner Center is half-
heartedly decorated with a few streamers
and balloons. The music is provided by a
DJ, so the music will be “American Pie,”
“Bohemian Rhapsody,” and “Everything I
Do (I Do it For You)” over and over again.
You and your date either (1) Hook up in
public even though you are both sober or (2)
hardly ever see each other because he is
busy hi gh-ﬁving his friends and she is busy
comforting a crying friend in the bathroom.
Or, worse still...

Junior High School Hop: Bring a date?
God, how embarassing. He might think I
like him. Listen to the sounds of Poison and
Debbie Gibson as chaperones watch your
every move. Stare at cute members of the
opposite sex from safely‘ across the room in
the protective custody of your friends. True
romance comes when that special someone
walks across the room and mutters those
fateful words: “Will you go with me?”

Woodstock III: Tie a ﬂannel around

FD chairman
Paducah Joe
Framptom was really
torn when it came to
choosing this year’s
theme. A longtime fa-
vorite of Joe’s is Great
Social Purges of the
Twentieth Century.

fireworks this
year? No prob-
lem. Perhaps the
“suprise”thatthe
committee has
promsied us will
be a simulated
case of cirrosis.

Back to the
Confederacy:
The FD commit-
tee won ’t have to
worry about poor
attendanceto this
ball because so
many W&L stu-
dents already
long to be there.
Anactor playing
Robert E. Lee
canwalkthrough
the gym kicking us all out of school for
ungentlemanly behavior. The only theme
that W&L students might be more respon-
sive to would have to be Back to the Reagan
Administration.

Disney World: W&L spends lots of
money on FD anyway, so why don’t we just
go for it and make our own amusement
park? The rude French waiters scheduled to
wander through the gym this year can dress
up as everyone’s favorite Disney charac-
ters. We can take the roof off of the gym to
allow more room for Space Mountain. Japa-
nese tourists can double as Party Pic pho-
tographers. Perhaps the children of Lexing-
ton will be allowed to stay up extra late for
this one special night so they can wander
through the gym entertaining us by losing
their Mickey Mouse balloons and crying
(not that there's anything wrong with that.
It’s happened to me and I know how trau-
matic it can be) and whining about wanting
ice cream. How beautiful.

Behind the Iron Curtain: In front of
Warner Center will be a large statue of Karl
Marx. The interior will be covered in gray
paper with an occasional red“Workers of
the World Unite” sign to spice things up, if
only sparsely. Added realism will come
from the secret police (played by Lexington’s
finest) and long lines for bread.

A Salute to Suzi Landolphi: Suzi the Sex
Girl’s likeness is plastered all over the gym.
The ﬂoor is covered entirely with condoms.
More condoms hang from the ceiling, in-
ﬂated in the balloon-like style that so irri-
tates Suzi. Conservative students

izes it. A magical night? That’s what you'll
tell yourself, considering how much money
you’ll sink into it.

Now you know how much potential
Fancy Dress Ball has. Get psyched. Unless
you chose the last theme, it will without a
doubt be a night to remember.

Thomas searches
for the real Lee

BY CINDY YOUNG
Phi Staff Writer

“When the scholarly dust clears, Lee will remain a hero,” Emory M.
Thomas assured last night’s audience in Northern Auditorium.

The dust to which Thomas refers concerns the ongoing debate between
scholars concerning the actual character of Robert E. Lee, behind his marble
ﬁgure, and has not settled 125 years after his death in 1870.

With his new book due in stores this May, Thomas will contribute to the
academic world the first comprehensive biography on Lee since 1937, and
“scholarly dust” will again rise.

Thomas has already earned himself a distinguished reputation in the
field of history, however.

Born and educated in Richmond, Virginia, Thomas received his under-
graduate degree in the University of Virginia and went on to earn his Ph.D.
from Rice University.

Thomas’ contributions to the ﬁeld of history include Encyclopedia of the
Confederacy, The Confederacy as a Revolutionary Experience, and The
Confederate Nation, 1861-1865, a work to which W&L History Professor
J. Holt Merchant, Jr. refers as “the best synthesis of the history of the
Confederacy [to date].” Thomas is now Regents Professor of History at the
University of Georgia, where he has taught since 1967.

In his speech entitled “Rethinking Robert E. Lee,” Thomas spoke first of
the two traditional -and opposing- images of Lee: that of the pious saint
carved in marble and of the insecure man full of complexities and inner
weakness.

“Somewhere between the two images,” Thomas believes, “walks the

The Presidential Search Committee met a few

The world is my classroom

Phot by Betsy Green, The Ring-tum Phi

Professors opened the doors and led discussions outside this week as the weather turned
surprisingly warm. The temperature reached a pleasant 71 degrees.

American society
inhibits participation,
says Guinier

BY MICHAEI. Hswusrr ..
Phi Staff Writer

American society operates on a winner
takes all mentality that undermines the
true purpose of a participatory democ-
racy, said Lani Guinier Thursday night.

“We approach it as a game, a
blame game.”

Guinier spoke in Lee Chapel as part of
Black History Month. Her speech was
sponsored by the Minority Student Asso-
ciation, the Black Law Students Associa-
tion, the American Civil Liberties Union
and the Politics department. Two years
ago, President Clinton nominated Guinier
to assistant Attorney General for the Civil
Rights Division of the Department of J us-
tice. Amidst controversy over her legal
writings, Clinton withdrew her nomina-
tion before she aired her views for the
Senate Conﬁrmation Committee. Guinier
graduated from Radcliffe College and Yale
University Law School and has written a
book entitled The Tyranny of the Major-
ity: Fundamental Fairness in Represen-
tative Democracy.

She said society is still divided be-
tween blacks and whites, just as the Kemer
Commission announced 30 years ago.
Racial discrimination is treated as if it
only affects individuals. Racial discrimi-
nation, however, means reduced opportu-
nities for minorities and women. Because
civil rights are treated this way, she said
it’s not surprising that no one wants to talk
about the issue.

Americans believe in rewarding win-
ners and punishing losers, she said. The
poor are told that they deserve their status
because of their lack of character. Win-
ners are not held accountable to anyone
but themselves. Guinier said this is dan-
gerous and divides Americans into “Us
vs. Them.”

“If the rules favor us, then the them
may play another game,” she said. “When
we don’t play fair, the losers decide to find
their own perverse way to level the play-
ing field.”

In the inner-cities, people who see the
unfairness of the system will say, “If you
don’t give me the sneakers, I’ll shoot
you.” She said this is their version of
personal responsibility in which the ends

justify the means.

Guinier said Americans may have
pushed too far for rugged individualism
and personal responsibility.

“Our social Darwinism may have
worked too well.”

Americans end up playing a game
where everybody loses, she said. Politi-
cians also play this game by personalizing
arguments and presenting extreme posi-
tions as mainstream. She said politicians
engage in drive-by debate where the other
person is always wrong.

The measure of a democracy is the
quality of the public discourse, but Ameri-
can society doesn’t give everybody an
equal voice, she said. Guinier believed
society needs to rethink its ideas about
participatory democracy. She advocated
a positive-sum democracy where winners
and losers have something to gain.

Some of her ideas that were vilified as
anti-democratic were simply a way of
describing positive-sum games in elect-
ing representatives, she said. She said her
ideas were designed to empower political
minorities, and some of them have been
used to empower Republicans in a Demo-
cratic majority.

She said she was not against majority
rule, but she worried about a system where
the majority gets all the power all the time
and the political minority always loses.
She cited cumulative voting as a way to
achieve a positive-sum democracy. In
cumulative voting, a shareholderin acom-
pany, for example, would get ﬁve votes
and use those votes in any combination he
wanted. In this way, a politically cohesive
minority who vote strategically can never
be denied a representative if there are
enough seats. She said cumulative votin g
allows a racial minority to plump all the
votes on a candidate if they chose. It also
allows for transracial voting. In the end,
she said everyone gets represented by
someone they voted for—not someone
they voted against.

At the end of her speech, she quoted
West African writer, Chinua Achebe.

“The poet who is not in trouble with the
King is in trouble with her work.”

She hoped the upcoming generation
will confront honestly the issues so that no
one will be in trouble with their work.

Possible nominee
speaks to law school  

BY SARAH GILBERT
Phi Executive Editor

Espousing a platform of public morality, belief in an all-powerful God, and
the resurrection of the marriage-based family, Dr. Alan Keyes spoke to
students Feb. 21 at the Washington and Lee University School of Law. .

Keyes, who might run for United States president in 1996 on the Republi-
can ticket, was appointed by Ronald Reagan to the State Department, and hosts
a Baltimore radio talk show. He was a recent U.S. Senate candidate in
Maryland.

He spoke on the topic of “Government v. The People: Achieving a Balance
of Power.” Quoting extensively from James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and
French political philosophers, Keyes eloquently expounded his philosophy of
the role of government in society.

Keyes felt that, though extensive governmental control is never the goal,
government must often step in to keep the country in order.

“If the people cannot control themselves, the government must enforce
control,” he said. He felt that, for instance, drug control laws are necessary in
a society in which people cannot control their own habits, but if the people are
able to establish a public morality, we will eventually be able to eliminate laws
against drugs.

The way toward this morality, Keyes said, is the reinforcement of the
marriage-based family, which is the key to advancement of society.

When asked about his view of the role of the conservative black in the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Keyes said that
the conservative black people have no interest in the organization.

' true Lee.” This is the Lee in which Thomas is interested, and about which
he has written his book.

Thomas adds to the characteristic solemnity and sternness with which
Lee is traditionally portrayed a “tremendous sense of humor.” Thomas’ Lee
“was keenly aware of the absurdity of the human condition, and thought it
was wonderful.”

For evidence of the sense of humor with which Lee entertained himself
and his acquaintances, Thomas turns to Lee’s letters.

One revealing letter is that written by Lee in 1835, while participating in
a survey expedition of land near Lake Erie. ln the letter, Lee recounts to a
friend in Washington his committing of -in Thomas’s words- “a casual
murder and theft in an act of trespass” of a nearby lighthouse.

The letter caused great anguish to Douglas Freeman, whose biography
preserves about Lee the heroic legend still deeply rooted in the American
mind. Freeman was never able to accept the letter, and, as best he could,
adapted and often ignored the entire episode.

A later historian finally solved the mysterious letter, detecting under-
neath Lee’s descriptions an imagination and sense of humor. The individual
(a'"damn Canadian snake”) whom Lee admits to killing has now been

ascertained as just that, a snake. The lighthouse, furthermore, had long been aban-
doned, invalidating any charges of trespass.

Thomas explains the confusion by concluding that “Lee had a much better sense of
humor than did Douglas Freeman.”

This sense of humorwhich ﬁlters into Lee’s letters may well have been what enabled
Lee to cope with the disasters he had to face throughout his life, both on a military and
personal level.

Throughout his lifetime, Lee ultimately faced not only massive military defeats,
which Thomas attributes much less to Lee than to those he worked with, but also the
heartbreak of a family plagued by disease, wartime imprisonment and death.

Despite the many tragedies that confronted Lee throughout his life, however, he
never surrendered to despair. He “really never lost sight of his perspective,” Thomas
stresses, maintaining instead his “comic vision of life.”

Lee perhaps offered his greatest gift to the human spirit in his ability to withstand
“an incredible series of pain and adverse circumstances to him and to people he loved.”

While still feeling responsible for such bitter difficulties, Robert E. Lee “knew he
could rise above them, and be the man he was and had worked so hard to become.”
Emory Thomas’ upcoming book promises to offer the most advanced understanding
to date of just who that man was, and what he became.

“Mylie Evers (the new president of NAACP) told everyone she was going
to turn the organization around, with a new agenda, and then said they were
going to be the cat’s paw of the Democratic liberal agenda in Washington,”
Keyes said. “But that’s just what they have always done.

‘‘If she really wanted to turn the NAACP around, she would work toward
solving the one thing that will really effect the advancement of colored people,
which is...the resurrection of the marriage-based family.”

He also believes that Jefferson’s references to God reinforce the elimina-
tion of the Roe v. Wade doctrine of legalized abortions.

“lt’s so obvious that he believed in an all-powerful creator. If you will look
at the philosophers Jefferson was reading at the time, you will find that they
did not refer to the creation of man in the same way Jefferson did. They were
writipg that all people were born equal, and he said that all men were created,
equa .

“lt’s ridiculous. lfl told you that I was going to make a law that you could
not eat pork, but left it up to you to decide what pork was, l would be doing
nothing. It is the same idea with those who say that they can decide at what
point humanity begins. Who has the power to say who is human and who is
not?”

After Sunrise - ¢5r1‘3r‘:‘r

After seeing Richard Linklater’s Dazed and Confused, I
was eager for him to make another ﬁlm, in the hopes of more
colorful characters and oh-so—true high-school conversa-
tions. Well, After Sunrise is not the ﬁlm I thought it would
be — but it’s still worth a trip to the theater.

Linklater’s ﬁrst ﬁlm, Slacker, was an incredibly boring
yet insightful peek into slacker-dom, full of people going
nowhere and perfectly happy that way. It meandered across
scenes, characters, plot lines, picking them up and discard-
ing them like Styrofoam cups.

Dazed and Confused also had hardly any plot, but the
characters were focused and related to one another. The
action took place within a small world, the last day of high
school in the late seventies.

In his latest ﬁlm, After Sunrise, Linklater continues
condensing the cast: the two leads, Jesse and Celine have
ninety-percent of the dialogue. But instead of revelling in
cultural idiosyncrasies — music by Sweet, hot rods by
Plymouth and lots of pot —— he decides to tackle a larger issue,
Love.

Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is a young American touring Eu-
rope by train, who has recently been dumped by his girl-
friend. He meets the angelic Celine (Julie Delpy), who has
just visited her grandmother in Budapest and is on her way
back to Paris. They fall into conversation on the train ride,
and when Hawke has to get off in Vienna, he persuades her
to accompany him. But he’s got to catch a plane forAmerica
the next morning, so they will have only this one night to be
together. We follow them around as the romance builds and
then watch them say good-bye at dawn.

Linklater, who also co-wrote the script, does a good job
with the couple’s interaction and adventures. The audience
can see their interest in each other build and become more
and more intense, until by the end of the ﬁlm the two act as
if they had been life-long lovers.

But it takes a while to get going — not just the romance,
but the conversation. The ﬁrst forty-ﬁve minutes or so, it
seems that they are speaking to the camera, instead of each
other. But then again, when you’re ﬁrst getting to know
someone, it often seems like conversation is just a tool to
impress and calm the other person (see Fraternity Rush). At
any rate, by the time they reveal how deep their interest in
one another truly is, the characters are really taking shape
and pulling the audience in.

I think Linklater deserves a lot of credit for the way he
changes their relationship over the course of the ﬁlm. First,
the two are clearly on-screen just for the audience’s sake,
without being really concerned with one another. However,
by dawn there is a real chemistry and passion boiling
beneath the surface of their dialogue, almost hidden from
the audience, like a secret romance between them which
we’re simply not privy to.

Linklater also deserves praise for not drenching us with
all the “twentysomething” junk most movies targeted to
college students are ﬁlled with. Ethan Hawke has some
funky facial hair, but otherwise Linklater largely avoids any
explicit references to their age or culture, hip, French or
otherwise. ‘

Instead, the conversations between Delpy and Hawke are
interesting, tender, curious, funny, blunt, shy, awkward —
everything we would expect of two people trying to impress
one another and falling in love in the process.

Julie Delpy hasn’t gotten very much exposure in America,
with the exception of The Three Musketeers. Nevertheless,
she is a ﬁne actress with a long list of notable European ﬁlms
behind her (including both Blue and White, which are being
shown by the Film Society the week after FD); hopefully
After Sunrise will make more Americans familiar with her.
She carries her character well, trying to maintain a facade of
modern “You’ve come a long way, baby” feminism while at
the same time simply going head over heels in romantic, it’s-
always-springtime love.

Ethan Hawke is much more likable and realistic than his
character in Reality Bites. Here, Jesse doesn’t have any of
the silly, pretentious “Gen X” habits Troy Dyer displayed
in that film (such as browsing through Being and Time in a
diner). Rather, he’s a normal American male, searching for
something, exactly what he doesn’t know — but then he
stumbles upon it.

After Sunrise is not a particularly profound ﬁlm, and it
won’t prompt the emotional to tears. Instead, its got wonder-
fully realistic dialogue, and the characters act just as we
would in their situation. Basically, it’s simply a well—made
light romance, a perfect date movie in the tradition of When
Harry Met Sally... or Sleepless in Seattle.

is a secret. The line between per-

everyone becomes a suspect. It
could be your best friend, your

So, if your friends have been hav-

He will drop clues and names of
students that may be involved in
the murder. The murderer will
always be in the room and will try
and shift the guilt on to innocent
audience members.

In the end, audience members
will be asked to ﬁll out a solution
sheet which will secretly divulge
their accusations to the detective,
who in turn uses the theories to
help him solve the crime. The
audience will be able to compete
individually or in teams to solve
the case.

“Mystery prizes will be
awarded to the teams or individu-

 By MICHAEL HEWLETT
Phi Staff Writer

Black conservatism has caught the imagi-
nation of American politics.

Clarence Thomas serves on the Supreme
Court, after a controversial nomination.

Thomas Sowell spews his tough-minded
economic analysis in Forbes as well as daily
newspapers across the country.

Armstrong Williams and Ken Hamblin
are now being called the “black Rush
Limbaughs.”

Katherine Tate, author of From Protest
to Politics: TheNewBlack Voters inAmeri-
can Elections, argues that blacks are on
average socially conservative but economi-
cally liberal.

“Roberts contends that
Thomas uses law as an
excuse why his decisions
fail to promote racial
justice.”

Ronald Suresh Roberts, author of
Clarence Thomas and the Tough Love
Crowd: Counterfeit Heroes and Unhappy
Truths, argues that these black neo-conser-
vatives are really just an eccentricity that the
media has exaggerated into a movement.

Roberts contends black conservatives
present themselves as harsh truth-tellers.

Far from being uncaring, they often claim
to care for the people they criticize.

Although these black conservatives are
often derided as “Uncle Toms,” Roberts
argues that this label is too simplistic.

Instead, their ﬂawed thinking lies in their
construction of truth.

Because they lack a constituency, they
cling to a notion of truth to defend their
political positions.

Clarence Thomas and others often point
out their inability to make inroads in the
black community as proof of their courage
to speak the “truth.”

Presenting themselves as brutally hon-

Puis-je avoir la carte de vins? May I have the wine list,

please?

J ’aimerais une bouteille de vin blanc/rouge. I'd like a

bottle of white/red wine.
Buzzoff,

est, they claim their willingness to think
independently and criticize what they see as
an internal “thought police” within the black
community.

Furthermore, especially in law, Roberts
argues black conservatives utilize Julien
Benda’s conception of intellectual thought
divorced from ideology or passion. In their
view, too much of a concern with the dispos-
sessed or race gets in the way of true intellec-
tual thought.

According to Stephen Carter, author of
Reﬂections of a Affirmative Action Baby,
“Literalistic egalitarianism, appropriate and
relevant to problems of political and social
life, cannot be permitted to invade and domi-
nate the crucial areas of the intellect, aes-
thetics and ethics.”

Although conservatives such as Thomas
speak of a need for racial justice, they search
for an high objective truth that produces a
result opposite of racial justice.

Sometimes this truth is law.

Roberts contends that Thomas uses law
as an excuse why his decisions fail to pro-
mote racial justice.

He conceives of the Constitution as a
imperfect document that is unable to solve
all social ills.

In Hudson v. McMillan, a case about
prison guards using excessive force on a
prisoner, Thomas dissented from the major-
ity decision, saying that guards beating pris-
oners did not constitute cruel and unusual
punishment under the Eighth Amendment:
“The Eighth Amendment is not, and should
not be turned into, a National Code of Prison
Regulations.”

Overall, Roberts presents a devastating
critique of black conservatism.

His writing style combines incisive argu-
ments with a wry sense of humor and a blunt
forcefulness.

He writes with authority and intelligence.

For those who are looking for easy read-
ing, this book is not it.

Roberts weaves complex legal and philo-
sophical theories in the text.

People who have no understanding of
law or current legal theories may have a hard
time reading this book.

Roberts oftentimes analyzes heady is-
sues, but his prose is usually clear and con-
cise. He adds a fresh voice of reason to the
debate about black conservatism in an in-
creasingly conservative environment.

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

A word of friendly advice...

Today a new university president will be announced, taking
the helm at one of the oldest and most traditional schools in the
country, and the job is a tough one.

An extensive familiarity with Washington and Lee history
and tradition is a necessary characteristic for any potential
W&L leader, and I would imagine that the selection commit-
tee has taken this into consideration. The nature of the honor
code and similar values of W&L culture pre-suppose a close
and careful study of the life of Robert E. Lee and the inherent
system of beliefs of the community.

Beyond this, though, the Phi would be honored to bestow
some advice for the new president, with the hopes that he or
she will benefit from the 97 years of experience the newspaper
has at Washington and Lee.

First, learn the names of the students. We all came to
Washington and Lee, in part, because of the small campus, in
which personal relationships with faculty and administration
are possible and integral parts of our college experience. A
little extra effort on your part will go a long way to strengthen
your relationship with the campus.

Second, respect your elders. Lee, Washington, Huntley,
these predecessors are dearly loved by the W&L community
and should not, at any expense, be held in any less than the
utmost regard.

Third, love your neighbors. One of the unusual perks of the
W&L presidency is the Lee House, conveniently located right
next door to the largest of the freshman dorms. We are not
quite sure if this is a good or bad thing, but you will get to know
many of the students in the freshman class in an unusually
intimate way.

Fourth, learn the Greek alphabet. All of the students know
it, and you will regret deeply any mis-pronounced Greek
letters or misplaced Greek abbreviations (i.e., never call the
lambda Chi Alpha fraternity “Lambda”).

The Phi wishes the new president, whomever he or she may
be, the best of luck; we understand the unusual nature of your
position, and we, as one of the oldest campus newspapers in
the country, can empathize with the difficulty of constantly re-
creating something which is older than we can ever hope to be.
Good luck!

Quotes of the Week...

“The key to a good FD is to get to the ball before

The Ring-tum Phi, February 34, 1995

Canadians have it both Ways

5MEL1ssA siwm, '97

The only questions they asked me at
the Canadian border were about fire-
arms, alcohol, and cigarettes. It is pos-
sible, of course, that the customs agent
didn’t think I looked particularly sus-
picious, with my hands lying conspicu-
ously on the dashboard and my brown
bag lunch hidden carefully within my
bundle of skis. Heaven forbid that I
should smuggle any fruit ﬂies across
the border? But as I coasted self-con-
sciously through the wire gate that sepa-
rates the two countries, I watched two
young men with Idaho plates being
shaken down by the side of the road.
Their crime? Perhaps the three unde-
clared hunting riﬂes stashed in their
aging car, behind the cooler of beer.

The greatest customs of infractions
are not the transport of fruit ﬂies or the
smuggling of sportsmen’s riﬂes. They
are the cars ﬁlled to the limit with
cartons of cigarettes. Despite the re-
cent and sudden drop in the Canadian
dollar, a successful cigarette smuggler
can reap hundreds of dollars in profit

, for each shipment. The reason? It is the

same reason for which a very success-
ful pub in Vancouver, British Colum-
bia, goes by the name “The Jolly Tax-
payer”: Canadians pay ﬁfty-ﬁve per-
cent of their income in state and na-
tional taxes. Imagine working from
January until July each year without
earning a cent towards your own ex-
penses. As much as that ﬁfty-ﬁve per-
cent pays for national health care and
law enforcement, “watchful” customs
agents, and a liquor control board, my
Canadian friends still pay $125 to have
their teeth cleaned.

Perhaps in some way the advan-
tages balanceout.Those wholive close
to the border are experts at benefiting
from the huge warehouse food outlets
on the American side. Some even re-
tain houses on both sides, like the fam-
ily friend who prefers to live in Wash-
ington state but keeps an apartment in
Vancouver so that he may continue to
collect his hefty Canadian disability
checks. Housing is a complicated issue
for those who delve into the world of
real estate trading, however. The United
States exacts a sizable capital gains tax

on housing, but allows deductions for

renovations and repairs, whereas in"

Canada the exact opposite is true: there
is no capital gains tax, but home repair
is a costly, and
sometimes unprof-
itable, endeavor. In
over-simplified

Kill ’em all, let God sort them out

ALEX CHRISTENSEN, ’98

Fax (703) 462-4060

In this week’s column I was going to write
about the case of Jesse DeWayne Jacobs, a man
many believe was innocent of the murder for
which he was executed by the state of Texas in
January. Yes, I admit it, I was going to fulminate
about the injustice of the case, not to mention its
inhumanity. So, I logged on to Liberty and started
up a Lexis/Nexis search on
“Jacobs,” “Urdiales” (the
murder victim), “Texas,” and
“execution.” (For those of you
whoare computerilliterate and
sorta don’t get the drift of this,
I’m afraid it’s just time for
you to suck it up and figure it
out. Hamburgers will never
cost five cents again. $200
will not buy you a
new Cadillac.)

The search brought up a
bunch of editorials, and, gem
of gems, the thing all journalists love: the pure,
unfiltered Supreme Court opinion. So I scrolled
through a bunch of junk‘ until I got the basic drift
of the case. .

In February, 1986, Jesse Jacobs was on parole
in the state of Texas for participating in the
beating to death of a retarded man with a fence
post in Illinois, when he was convinced by his
sister, Bobbie Jean Hogan, to help kidnap her
boyfriend’s ex-wife, Etta Ann Urdiales, in order
to scare her into giving up custody of her children.

Hey, I never said this was going to be pretty.
This is the deep, rotted, mutating marrow of
America we are talking about. lt’s not for the
weak-hearted.

After stalking Urdiales for several days, he got
her alone in her apartment and kidnapped her. He

...somebody,
please, stop these

hick Texans before
they kill again.

brought her to an abandoned house and ‘waited for
Hogan to show up. What happened next is the bone
of contention. .

At Jacobs’s trial, the ﬁrst trial, his own confession
was used by the prosecution as the major piece of
evidence against him. However, at the trial, he testified
that his confession was false. According to the confes-
sion, he killed Urdiales and buried her in a wooded area,
to which he led the police. Now he said he had left Hogan
alone with Urdiales, not knowing that Hogan_was armed
(with the gun he had given her days earlier). When
Hogan accidentally shot Urdiales
while trying to frighten her, Jacobs
entered the house, ascertained the
situation, and told his sister to go
home, he would take care of things.
He then buried Urdiales and left town,
embarking on a six-month
robbery spree.

The jury believed the original con-
fession, and Jacobs was sentenced to
the death penalty.

Then, at Hogan’s trial, the pros-
ecution (in fact, the same prosecutor,

Peter Speers), changed stories. Now
he brought inJacobs to testify that Hogan had pulled the
trigger. (In case you are wondering at this point, yes, this
is highly illegal. It is called “prosecutorial misconduct”
when everyone is being civil.)

The jury believed the prosecution again (this is
Texas, not California) and convicted Hogan of murder.
However, at sentencing, Hogan’s lawyers convinced
the jury that the shooting had been an accident, resulting
in a ten-year sentence for involuntary manslaughter.

During the many appeals, Jacobs argued, correctly,
that precedent did not allow prosecutors to simply
introduce whatever evidence might point to guilt; they
had to know it was true, or at least not know that it was
not true. Clearly, they had done that in either Jacobs’s
case or Hogan’s. You can’t have prosecutors arguing
that there was one murderer but convicting two people
of it, once using one against the other.

To dramatize the problem here, two quotes from
Pete Speers, one from Jacobs’s trial and one from
Hogan’s: “The simple fact is that Jesse Jacobs, and
Jesse Jacobs alone, killed Etta Ann Urdiales,” and
later, “I’m convinced that Bobbie Hogan is the one
who pulled the trigger.” _

At the Supreme Court, this is exactly Justice
John Paul Stevens argued in his dissent, joined by
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and joined in the pnn-
ciple that a ruling for review should have been issued
by Justice Stephen Breyer. Where were the other six
members of the Court during all of this? Well, appar-
ently they were trying to prove a point. That point is
that the appeals process should not be used in a
deleterious ‘manner in order to keep death row in-
mates alive for years after their sentencing. Unfortu-
nately, in their zeal, they have become blinded to real
issues of law and procedure set down clearly through
years of precedent.

I’m not going to argue that the courts should
outlaw the death penalty. I think clearly it isa sen-
tence that is pennitted by law, custom and history.
and its practice should be left up to the legislative
bodies where all other laws are made. .

I do think I would vote against it_as a bad Idea.
Mario Cuomo tells a story about a little boy made
aware of an execution asking his mother. “Why are
they killing that man?” “Because he killed another
person, and if anybody killed you, that man would be
killed, too.” “And what about if I was raped. Mama?
Would you rape that man?”

I think Mario Cuomo is right. However, I also
think his argument belongs in the legislature rather
than the courts. .

But somebody, please, stop these hick Texans
before they kill again. _

Oh, by the way, Bobbie Jean Hogan is up for
parole this year.

Credit cards threaten our world

DREAM LAND
Richard Weaver

Let us now sit down in our favorite
chair and address the greatest threat
facing Washington and Lee students
today: credit card companies. They
innocently call you on the phone, wav-
ing $500 credit lines in your face, know-
ing that you’ll bite, line, hook, and
sinker, and sell yourself into the world
of the credit-card enslaved.

It’s so easy! Before long, you are
calling 1-800-FLOWERS and Judy,
the Time-Life Operator, or ordering
Elvis commemorative plates from the
Franklin Mint, because all you need is
a little piece of plastic and no actual
money leaves your wallet. And it’s
so easy!

Not that l have gone overboard.
Quite frankly, I enjoy the convenience
of receiving a bill of my expenditures
at the end of the month. OK, I’ll be
honest: In enjoy receiving two bills of
expenditures. You must understand, I
am a repeat offender; I have swallowed
the Visa AND Mastercard bait.

A voice deep inside of me has al-
ways wanted to answer a sales clerk
who has said “Visa or Mastercard?” by
saying,“Yourchoice.”Thisthrill, how-
ever, quickly disappears whenever the
mail comes, and I begin to question the
wisdom of that $144.51 impulse pur-
chase at “South of the Border.”

I must now get up from my comfort-
able chair and congratulate whatever
force decided to offer college students
credit cards; it is a genius. I say “it”
because I have a new conspiracy theory
that credit cards are the secret weapons
of an evil and sadistic reptilian alien
race, destined to saddle this generation
with unmanageable debt and this con-
trol it as a part of its evil and sadistic
plan to take over our great free nation,
and harvest its people for food, and
drain our oceans
of water to sat-
isfy theirevil and
sadistic leader,
and to guarantee
their evil and sa-
distic desert

survival. This
theory is, basi-
cally, the plot

A voice deep inside of

monthly payments:

Visa: Your minimum payment this
month is $25. Are you going to pay it?

Robert E. Student: Well, um, I
have to pay the tow truck that took
my car... ’

Visa: Well perhaps our friend Diana
can persuade you to change your mind.

Robert E. Student: NO! NO!
PLEASE NO! Here, here’s the $25. In
fact, take this $400 I was going to use
for my W&L

my watch...

My credit card conspiracy theory is
not limited just to Visa and Mastercard,

but it even includes ATM cards. Think
about it: you go to abank machine, type
in your personal identiﬁcation number
and then you withdraw your book
money for the semester and use it for a
weekend. By doing this, you immedi-
ately tip off the aliens as to your loca-
tion and then they can sit around their
TV screens with their alien buddies
and watch you (via the ATM video
cameras —— see how this is all tying in
?). The way that students handle their
finances around here probably provides
many entertainment opportunities for
the aliens.

Framptom advises community on ticket purchase

To the W&L community:

As you all are probably well aware,
the 88th annual Fancy Dress Ball is
rapidly approaching.

I would like to take this opportunity
to bring a few important points to
your attention.

Please be sure to purchase a ticket
and bring it with you to the ball. In the
past, there have been rumors that some
students have attended the ball without
purchasing a ticket. Attending the ball
without a ticket may be a violation of

the Honor System, and any alleged
violations will be reported to
the Executive Committee for
further investigation.

Tickets and memorabilia items will
be on sale in the University Center
beginning on Monday, February 27.
These items will be sold between 9
a.m. and 5 p.m. on Monday through
Thursday and from 9 a.m. until 2 p.m.
on Friday, March 3.

In addition, tickets and memora-
bilia items will be sold on Tuesday and

Wednesday evening from 6-8 p.m.
Tickets will also be sold at the front
door for any people who haven’t al-
ready purchased them.

Tickets for this year’s ball will $45
per couple. The entire memorabilia
package, consisting of one couple’s
ticket, two t-shirts, two posters, two
shot glasses, four cups, two playbills,
and two key chains will be sold for $80.
In addition, these items as well as se-
lected items from previous years will
be sold separately.

As previously announced, the ball
will be held in the Warner Center on
Friday, March 3 from 9:30 p.m. until
1:30 a.m.

The steering committee has worked
exceptionally hard to bring you this
year’s ball, and I hope that all of you
attend and enjoy the ball. Best wishes
for a safe and entertaining Fancy
Dress weekend.

Executive Committee addresses faculty and staff about Honor system

To the W&L community:

This is in reference to the statement
drafted by the Executive Committee
regarding honor expectations outside
the classroom. Last year’s White Book
Review Committee had a number of
recommendations regarding non-white
book revisions at W&L. As a result of
this, this year’s Executive Committee

Honor systems cannot

To the editor:

On February 1, Professor Donald
McCabe of Rutgers University took
part in a panel discussion in Lee Chapel
about the honor system. The Execu-
tive Committee, the EC Honor Re-
Orientation Committee and Contact
sponsored the event. Professor
McCabe is a leading expert on honor
systems, and his research confirmed
that W&L’s system works better than
any other in the country. Congratula-
tions to all the students, faculty and
administrators who contribute to the
fine environment that allows the sys-
tem to ﬂourish. Two issues discussed
by the panel were the role of fear and
the role of students and faculty in the
system. As an EC member and Honor
Re-Orientation Committee member, I
wanted to offer some comments. The
two roles illustrate the transformation
that a student ideally undergoes while
living underthe honor system at W&L.

An honor system that wields the

formed a sub-committee to study these
recommendations. One particular con-
cern of students at W&L was the de-
gree of seriousness with which faculty
and staff view the honor system. Many
students feel that the honor system is
not held in the same regard by faculty
as by students. With this in mind, the
committee felt it appropriate to draft a

sword of fear does little to educate
students about how to live honorably.
All that system teaches is how to avoid
consequences. When the student en-
ters other phases of life, the value of
honor is discarded. At W&L, fear may
be very real sometimes because of the
consequences of committing an honor
violation. If respect for honor never
replaces this fear, the system has not
worked. Fear cannot produce the per-
sonal growth that comes in four years
of living in a community where honor
is revered and practiced.

Honor cannot be a pragmatic virtue.
I have noted the tendency of people to
describe how great the honor system is
because you can leave stuff around and
no one will bother it. This is a wonder-
ful effect of the community of trust.
Pens that fall on the floor sit there for
days because no one wants to pick up
someone else’s things. It is also cer-
tainly fantastic that professors do not
have to proctor exams. However, the

policy regarding their commitment to
the Honor system.

The sole purpose in drafting the
statement was to stress the spirit of
trust that makes W&L the institution
that it is today.

system is not there for convenience.

The system is there to educate us about

honor.

A few years ago at Vanderbilt Uni-

versity, a debate about the efficacy of
the honor code ensued after Professor
McCabe’s study of the school code
revealed around 65% of students ad-

mitted cheating. This was about the
nonnative level for private institutions
with honor codes. The reasons people
came up with in favor of an honor code
were that it was tradition, helped the
image of the school, and put everyone
on equal ground. All these reasons are
based in mere pragmatism, and the
result for the honor code is that no one
really cared about it. Students did not
abide by it. Pragmatic reasons for
having an honor system will not ulti-
mately sufﬁce because the burden be-
comes too great in the enforcement. If
we just like taking unproctored exams,
the single sanction would be too harsh.
The system would fall into disuse.

TALKBACK

 

 

To Washington and Lee Staff
Members:

The Honor System of Washington
and Lee is based on the fundamental
principle that a spirit of trust pervades
all aspects of student life. This spirit of
trust makes Washington and Lee a
unique educational institution. A
student’s word is accepted and re-

Recently at the University of Virginia,
the Board of Visitors seized control of
the honor system after many recent
court challenges to honor system ver-
dicts. UVA has a tradition of honor,
but this has not been enough. The
failure by the student body to continue
to operate the system on principles of
honor has led to the unfortunate situa-
tion where it is necessary to reconsider
the role of honor at UVA. Again, when
the reasons for enforcement become
clouded, the enforcement becomes
problematic. They might want to take
some lessons from W&L. However,
we must learn from their mistakes as
well.

W&L has a renowned tradition of
honor. General Lee did not base his
implementation of the honor system in
pragmatism. He understood duty. The
essayist and University of Chicago Pro-
fessor Richard Weaver once wrote,
“The tendency to see a thing in its
moral relationships, to discipline ego-

spected both on campus and in
the community.

The system is in essence one of
mutual trust—trust among students,
faculty, administrators, and staff that
persons attending Washington and Lee
will not lie, cheat, or steal.

It is the hope of the Executive Com-
mittee that all employees of Washing-

istic impulse, and to subordinate self to
a communal ideal of conduct appears
in Lee’s often quoted saying that duty is
the most sublime word in the language.”
These ideas are not trendy or popular in
contemporary American culture and
education. The supremacy of the indi-
vidual is often the gospel of both the
liberal and the conservative. They just
have different ideas about how to
achieve that goal. Honor is a duty, but
it is a duty within the context _of a
community. W&L helps us to under-
stand that duty to others is a basis for
further education. As I said before
though, tradition is not a good enough
argument for an honor system. Stu-
dents have to ferret out the principles
Lee meant by duty and live them. I do
not claim to be able to put those prin-
ciples in a concise sentence. Honor at
W&L is only what the current students
allow it to be. However, when students
fail to base honoron principle and duty,
it is the impending demise of the honor

ton and Lee extend to students the
same degree of trust that allows
students to enjoy unparalleled
academic freedom.

The Executive Committee exists to
serve all members of the Washington
and Lee community; any questions or
concerns should be directed to a mem-
ber of the Executive Committee.

system. It is the job of the older
students and the exp°rienced faculty
to facilitate understanding of the pro-
cess by which we leave W&L under-
standing a little bit more about our
duty to one another. The Executive
Committee has undertaken honor re-
orientation to contribute to theprocess
by which we hope to see older stu-
dents assess the lessons of honor
learned during their time at W&L.
later this spring a mock closed hear-
ing will allow students to take part as
EC members in a hearing. The honor
system video will be redone in the
spring term to accentuate the philoso-
phy and positive aspects of honor at
W&L. In spite of all of these things
the EC plans, the informal process of
students passing along the knowledge
of duty is the lifeblood of honor at
W&L. It is your system. Keep up the
good work.

FEBRUARY 24, 1995

Men ﬁnish strong at Southern States meet:

By Scorr BOOKWALTER
Phi Assistant Sports Editor.

The Washington and Lee
men’s swimming team climaxed
an outstanding season with a sen-
sational second place ﬁnish last
weekend at the Southern States
Championships at Davidson in

North Carolina.

Only Davidson, the home
team, could outlast the Generals,
who ﬁnished second in a ﬁeld of
eleven teams. In the process,
W&L duplicated last year’s run-

ner-up status.

In addition to a strong overall
performance, three W&L school
records were shattered in indi-
vidual events.

Sophomore Nathan Hottle
went on a rampage by destroying

records in both the 100 and 200
breaststroke, and the 400 freestyle
relay squad, consisting of senior
Tony Diederich, and juniors Dan
Stillman, Frank Braden, and
Craig Sears, smashed another
school mark.

Head coach Page Remillard
was obviously delighted with the
result.

“We prepared rather thor-

oughly for the meet and hoped to
be highly competitive,” he ex-
plained. “I-think we accomplished
that.”

Hottle swam far beyond com-

petitiveness.

His ﬁnish of 57.70 in the 100-

breast demolished the previous
school record by more than two
seconds, and his time of 2:05.37
in the 200 breaststroke was more
than four seconds ahead of the

. try in Division III.

previous pace.

Although he still ﬁnished sec-
ond in both races, Hottle auto-
matically qualiﬁed forthe NCAA
Championships in both events.
He also provisionally qualiﬁed
in the 400 individual medley, in
which he prevailed with a time of
4:08.99.

Since W&L was competing
against mostly Division I schools
at the meet, Hottle’s marks in the
100 and 200 breaststroke are ten-
tatively ranked ﬁrst in the coun-

with the performance of Braden.
The junior placed fourth in the
500-freestyle with a time of
4:41.01, which conditionally
earned him a spot in the NCAA
Championships.

He ﬁnished sixth in both the
100 and 200 freestyle, and also
assisted in the 400 freestyle relay
team’s record-breaking perfor-
mance, which tentatively quali-
fies for the NCAA’s as well.

“Frank has always had the tal-
ent; he just had to learn how to be
successful,” Remillard ex-
pressed. “He has just now dis-
covered it.”

Sears grabbed second place in
the 20OIMwith amark of 1 :57.52,
Stillman took fourth in the 50-
free by completing the race in
21.70 seconds, and senior John
Rowe latched onto the sixth spot

He also ended up as the sec-
ond highest individual scorer in
the meet.

“Last year, Nathan was just
tapping his potential ,” Remillard
mentioned. “This year, he has
experienced success.”

Remillard was also impressed

in the 200-breast with a 2:11.79.
All three times provisionally
qualiﬁed them for NCAA’s.

Diederich had a solid meet as
he ended up second in the 100-
frce with a time of 47.32 sec-
onds, and swam fourth in the
200-free with a time of 1:44.26.
Freshman Erik Holbrook also
garnered a fourth place ﬁnish in
the 200-butterﬂy, rolling in at
2:00.47.

The quartet of Stillman,
Diederich, Sears, and Hottle tri-
umphed in the 200-free relay with
a time of 1:26.17.

Washington and Lee had a
chance to crack another record,
but the 800-free relay team of
Braden, Diederich, Sears, and
Hottle was disqualiﬁed for start-
ing too early, after being on a
crash course toward another

school record.

Davidson beneﬁted from this
tough break, as well as from the
fact that W&L does not have a
diving team, in order to sneak
past the Generals and win th
meet.

“We kicked everybody ’s butts
in the pool,” Remillard stated.

Remillard was extremely sat-
isﬁcd with the Generals’ 6-1 regly
lar season log and expressed con-
ﬁdence in W&L’s chances at the
NCAA Championships in Ox-
ford, Ohio on March 16-18.

“At the beginning of the ye
we dedicated ourselves to pe -
formance,” he remarked. “Our
goals are to always go faster than
we did before, and to realize that
we can’! control what others do.”

“We want to make winning!
into a tradition.”

The women’s swim team ran over the competition at the Atlantic States/ODAC Championships

en route to amassinz 805 points (the next team had 600).

W&L demolishes Eastern Menno-
nite; drops heartbreaker to Sydney

By JOSHUA HESLINGA
Phi Staff Writer

While most of the school ﬁnished
midterms and left for a much-needed
break, the men’s basketball team com-
pleted its season with another trip to the
ODAC tournament, where they fell just
short of upsetting league champion
Hampden-Sydney in the ﬁnal game of
head coach Verne Canﬁeld’s long W&L
career.

The Generals secured a spot in the
ODAC tourney despite a 90-85 OT loss
to Lynchburg two weeks ago. In that
game, the Generals held a 66-54 lead
with 6:22 to play, but Lynchburg surged
behind Otis Tucker to close the gap.

Poor free-throw shooting allowed
Lynchburg to send the game to over-
time, as the Generals missed four key
shots in the ﬁnal minute and shot only
16-30 overall.

A three-pointer from junior Derek
Carter tied the game again at 81-81 late
in the extra period, but Lynchburg sank
its final ﬁve shots from the charity stripe
to provide the margin of defeat.

Junior forward Cam Dyer recorded a
strong 26-point, seven-rebound perfor-
mance in the loss. Sophomore Chris
Couzen contributed 16 points, and Carter
hit for 12 points, including two from
downtown.

The Generals split the ﬁnal two games
of the regular season, losing to rival
Roanoke 94- 80 on Saturday but re-

als with a 10-15 regular-season ﬁnish,
6-12 in the ODAC.

V In the Roanoke game, the Generals
trailed by only three points at half—time,
40-37, but the Maroons came out strong
in the second half, posting an 18-3 run to
lead 58-40. The Generals cut the lead to
77-71 with 4:39to play, but three straight
Roanoke baskets from Jason Bishop
ended the rally.

Chris Couzen was the game’s high
scorer as he tied a W&L school record
with seven three-pointers en route to a
career-high 29 points.

Dyer posted 16 points and senior
Mark Connelly contributed 10 in the
effort.

Against the Royals of EMU, 12 Gen-
erals got on the scoreboards, establish-
ing a quick 43-33 lead at intermission.
The second half was also all Generals,
rolling to the 24-point victory.

Couzen led the Generals again with a
game-high 21 points, and Carter added
14. Both Dyers, Cam and Kelly, also
tallied 14 points.

The Generals took their game to the
Salem Civic Center on Saturday for an
imposing ﬁrst-round showdown with
league-champion Hampden-Sydney. It
looked grim early, as the Generals shot
just 29% from the ﬁeld, leading to a 39-
26 haltime deﬁcit.

However, as the Generals have done
all season, they rallied fora 21-4 burst to
take a 65-57 lead with 6:31 to play.

The Generals tied it at 71 with two
minutes to go, but the Tigers grabbed a
76-73 lead with 33 seconds left.

Derek Carter’s attempt for the tie
was off, and the Generals’ last chance
jumper from Jon Coffman fell short
after two missed foul shots from the
Tigers with ﬁve seconds left.

Connelly ﬁnished his collegiate ca-
reer with a stellar game-high 18 points
and seven rebounds.

Season high scorer Cam Dyer posted
a double-double with 16 points and 12
rebounds, and Couzen added 11 points
and nine rebounds.

Connelly and Dyer also both earned
All-ODAC honors. Dyer was named to
the second team roster for leading the
Generals in scoring (17.2 points per
game) and rebounding (8.1 a game).
Connelly received honorable mention
after ﬁnishing second in both scoring
(11.9 ppg) and rebounding (6.7).

Canﬁeld listed his players’ effort as
the most positive aspect of the season.
“I ’m very excited about their future,” he
added. “They just need to learn how to
win some of the close ones. If they work
hard in the offseason on weaknesses and
improving theirskills, I look to see them
be very successful in the future.”

As for his upcoming plans, Canﬁeld
remarked, “There’s several things on
the horizon- I’m not sure yet. I’m going

Women turn in solid year

By STEPHEN WILLIARD
Phi Sports Editor

The Washington and Lee women’s
swim team may have pushed the limits a
little too far the last too weeks, but they
still emerged with a successful record.

One week after racing through the
ODAC/ Atlantic States meet, the lady
Generals had to take on even tougher
competition at the Southern States Cham-
pionships.

The Generals demolished the opposi-
tion at the ODAC Championships. The
second place squad, College of Notre
Dame, was 205 points behind W&L’s
pace.

Head coach Kiki Jacobs was not sur-
prised by the victory.

“We knew going into ODAC’s that
we were the odds on favorite,” remarked
the coach.

W&L was led by junior Rebekah
Prince. Prince turned in three individual
wins along with aiding in three relay
wins. In the 400 IM, Prince broke the
ODAC, Atlantic States, and school
record.

In the 200 back, Prince continued her
efforts as she provisionally qualiﬁed for
the NCAA Championships. In lieu of
these accomplishments, she was awarded
ODAC Swimmer of the Year.

Freshman Megan Wiedmaier and
Bligh Wollner each won two races and
Susan Fisher and Jen Miller won one
race each.

Following the standout team perfor-
mance, Jacobs was awarded the Atlantic
States Coach of the Year honors.

The next weekend proved to be
tougher for the Generals at the Southern
States Championships as they ﬁnished
seventh out of eleven squads.

When asked if the back to back week-
end meets affected the team’s perfor-
mance, Wiedmaier responded, “It did

because the ODAC’s was right in the ‘

middle of our tapering.”

Coach Jacobs agreed, “It was a tough
back-to-back with ODAC’s and South-
ern States.”

Prince once again stood out for the V

Generals, provisionally qualifying for
NCAA’s in the 100 back and for a
second time in the 200 back. The perfor-
mance should be enough to push her

into Nationals. V

“We’re 95 percent sure she’s going
to make it,” said Jacobs.

The 400 freestyle relay squad of
Prince, Wiedmaier, Jen Miller, and Laura
Marshall came up big as well as they

broke the school record by nearly two *

seconds.

Other highlights ofthe meet included
Wiedmaier winning the consolation
ﬂight of the 500 freestyle in a lifetime
best time.

Anne Spencer also posted strong
performances in the 500 free, 200 breast,
and 400 IM.

As the season came to an end, Jacobs
listed the team’s biggest accomplish- V

ments as posting an 8-3 record for the ‘

year, beating Catholic, and Prince’s
school record in the 400 IM and the
school record set by the 400 free relay
squad.

ForJacobs, this season marked a few
milestones.

“This is the ﬁrst year we’ve had a full
squad,” remarked the coach.

Also the seniors graduating this year
are special to Jacobs.

“That was my ﬁrst group that I had to V

work with all four years,” said Jacobs.
Both Wiedmaier and Jacobs re-

marked on the closeness of the team.
Jacobs said, “I think the squad was

pretty tight.” v

Wiedmaier took it on notch farther,
saying, “I think as a team, at the end, the
whole team, girls and guys, came to-
gether.”

The Generals women’s basketball
team conclude their 1994-95 season last
week, their ﬁrst in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference. The team ﬁnished
the season with a 6-18 overall record; 4-
16 in conference play.

Despite their record, the Generals
viewed this season as a learning experi-
ence and an introduction to the caliber of
play in the ODAC.

The team picked up an important win
in their final home game of the season.
The Generals put the pressure on Hollins
early, building a 35-21 lead.

Hollins managed to put together a run
to cut the lead to nine but the Generals
kept pouring on the offense and cruised
to a 62-42 victory. Sandra Holmes again
led the way for the Generals, scoring 17
points and pulling nine rebounds.

The team also set a season mark in
assists with ﬁfteen. The victory in the
ﬁnal home game was a noble way to send
off guard Amy Vogt and forward Amy
Mihal, the team’s only seniors.

Head Coach Terri Dadio felt that the
Hollins game was a good morale booster
for the team with three tough ODAC
teams remaining on the schedule.

“The Hollins game was a good win
for us,” said Dadio. “We played good
defense and shot the ball well. It was a

good ﬁnal game in the Warner Center
and it will provide a good direction for
this team next year.”

Later in the week, the Generals faced
a Roanoke team with a high-octane of-
fense. The Generals’ defense held
Roanoke to only 58 points but shot only
21 percent themselves and fell 58-31.
Holmes, however, had another strong

game with 12 points and 10 boards.
The team dropped their ﬁnal two

Women’s basketball ‘
ends difﬁcult season -

games of the season at Bridgewater "d
Randolph-Macon. In the Bﬁdggjwier
game the Generals were able to ﬁght
back from several large deﬁcits but could,
never claim the lead.

With forward Amy Mihal sidelined
with a virus, the Generals lacked the
strength in the paint to contend with
Bridgewater.

The Generals ended up losing 62-45.?
Holmes remained steady, tallying 18
points and grabbing 10 rebounds. Stacy
Williams also reached double ﬁgures
with thirteen.

Randolph-Macon also managed to;
get the jump on the Generals early on in
the contest, racing toa42-1 9 lead. W&L
only shot 33 percent, in contrast to R-
MC’s 52 percent, resulting in a 72-45.
Sandra Holmes once again led the way ‘
in scoring and rebounding for the team,
recording 11 and 10 respectively.

Coach Dadio and the women’s bas-
ketball team have every reason to look
forward to next season. The Generals’
Sandra Holmes returns for her senior‘
year.

Her numbers this season were im-
pressive: 12.8 points and 8.2 rebqxﬂls
per game. She recorded a double-double
in eight games. ,

The team also returns their other
three top scorers. Because of the small
size of the team, the ﬁve freshmen were
able to contribute regularly and should
have an increased role next year.

Dadio has also indicated that she
expects a strong class of incoming fresh-
man players. Plus, after one year of

seasoning, W&L will have a better idea
of what to expect from its ODAC com-
petitors. ‘

Commenting on the past season,
Coach Dadio said, “We improved with
each game, and we’re looking forward
to continuing that improvement next
year while adding some talented fresh- *7
men.”

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

LEXINGTON, VA.

FEBRUARY 27, 1995

Elrod named president

BY EMILY BAKER AND SARAH GILBERT
Phi Editors

A two-minute standing ovation
greeted Friday’s announcement that John
Elrod, Washington and Lee’s vice presi-
dent of academic affairs and dean of the
college, had been selected as W&L’s in-
coming president.

“I feel profoundly honored,” Elrod
said. “I consider this to be one ofthe best
jobs in higher education in America, and I
feel as fortunate as I can be to have this
job.”

Elrod will be the 22nd president of
Washington and Lee, Robert E. Lee’s ninth
successor, and will take office July 1,1995,
when John Wilson retires.

Students, faculty and administration
lauded the choice of the Board Selection
Committee.

“What our committee said to the
Board Selection Committee was that they
should use John Elrod as the standard by
which they should hold everyone else to,”
said William Watt, head of the Presidential
Search Committee which recommended
11 candidates to the Board from a pool of
130 applications.

Elrod came to Washington and Lee
University in 1984 as dean of the college
and professor of philosophy. Since he has

been at W&L, Elrod has expanded the .

curriculum in Cognitive Science, Neuro-
science, Russian Studies, Environmental
Science and Medieval and Renaissance
Studies. Wilson said the appointment of
Elrod was one of his best decisions as
president.

“The first act I performed when I
came here was to head a search committee
to ﬁnd a new dean of the college,” Wilson
said. “He has served admirably in that job.

“‘I have come to know him very
well; we talk every morning about the state
of the university. I don’t imagine that there
will be anything but a positive future with
John as president,” Wilson said.

Dean of the College John Elrod voices his yatitude in Lee Chapel
shortly after being named Washington and Lee’s new president
Feb. 24. Elrod will replace John Wilson, retiring in July.

Wilson enumerated Elrod’s qualifi-
cations, which should mark him as a very
successful president.

“First, he has a instinctive sense of
what a university is,” Wilson said. “There
are lot of people who work successfully in
universities and yet don ’t really know what
a university is about. John knows how you
can contrive an environment in which the
faculty and students can relate.”

Wilson also lauded Elrod’s honesty.

“John has the courage of his convic-
tions. People will not respect you if you try
to please everybody by tailoring your re-
sponses to them. You’ve got to make deci-
sions in this job, whether they be good, bad
or indifferent, no matter how you think
people will react.”

Other characteristics that will serve
Elrod well in his new position, Wilson
said, are his enthusiasm for life and the
university, his talent for communicating,
his analytical mind and his love of Wash-
ington and Lee.

“Fund-raising is principally a con-
veying of the meaning of the place with

enthusiasm and conviction,” Wilson said.
“You’re going to get people to support both
you and the institution if you have that.”

Student leaders were also very positive
about the selection.

“He knows how the school works,”
said Alex Cross, vice president of the execu-
tive committee. “He’s familiar with the im-
portant things, things that make W&L what it
is, and not just ‘number ﬁfteen’ in US News
and World Report.

“He recognizes the importance of stu-
dent autonomy on this campus and the impor-
tance of the fraternity system.”

Elrod’s immediate plans are to initiate
the search for a new vice president of aca-
demic affairs and dean of the college, a pro-
cess which should take about a year. In the
meantime, he plans to appoint an acting dean.

“I have been profoundly gratiﬁed by
the well-wishes of the students,” Elrod said.
“I didn’t know that there was such a profound
interest in this announcement, and Mimi and
I were really touched by that.

“I look forward to a long and positive
relationship with the campus.”

  comes to
3* W&L

BY CINDY YOUNG
Phi Staff Writer

Last Wednesday night, eight stools and a bare
stage provided the background for a moving reading
Iof the first half of Tony Kushner's award-winning
‘play Angels in America.
‘ K The play has won much acclaim from the dra-
imtic world, receiving both a Tony Award and
Pulitzer Prize and came to Washington and Lee
through the talents of the drama department, and was
sponsored by the Society for the Arts.

In front of an audience of nearly ﬁfty members of
the W&Land Lexington community, students Aaron
Brotherton, Arienne Bryant, Jeanne Dillon, Mandy
Irons, Joe Merlino, Denis Riva, Dan Tipton, and
Elizabeth Weaver breathed life into the characters
who populate Tony Kushner's play.

The play explores the difficulties encountered by
members of both heterosexual and homossexual
relationships.

The characters themselves, amidst casual conver-
sation, raise profound and sometimes deeply dis-
turbing questions about the human condition.

Instead of offering a distinct resolution, the play
ends abruptly; an angel approaches and the lights
fade.

The audience lingered in DuPont Gallery follow-
ing the play, and compliments abounded towards all
those involved. -

Compliments were also directed, deservedly, to-
wards members of the Society of the Arts in general
and the chairman in particular, senior Jon Van Dyke.

The Society has brought many alternatives social

Sophomores to
live on campus

By MICHAEL HEWLETT
Phi Staff Writer

In the fall of 1996, sophomores will be required
to live in university housing for another year.

Washington and Lee University’s Board of
Trustees passed the sophomore housing require-
ment Saturday by a unanimous vote. Dean of
Students David Howison said the requirement will
become policy beginning with next year’s fresh-
men class.

The policy will take about 100 sophomores out
of the real estate market, which will free up 25 to
50 rental spaces. Sophomore fraternity men will
continue to live in fraternity houses.

Howison held two open forums, one in Decem-
ber and one in February, to discuss the sophomore
housing requirement. When the Board of Trustees
met this weekend, Howison presented the policy to
the Student Live Committee, who passed it and
sent it to the Board of Trustees.

Howison said the policy will create a more
unified residential experience. He said freshmen
will not feel as pressured to sign contracts for
apartments and would improve the real estate
market for upperclassmen. Renters will either have
to improve their facilities or lower their prices,
Howison said. He said the policy will only affect
those marginal buildings.

“The market in the long run will be more
beneficial for the students,” he said.

The sophomore housing requirement could raise
as much as $200,000 of additional money, he said.
Howison said the administration is exploring ways
to upgrade Woods Creek Apartments and Gaines
upper-class dorms.

He said even with additional students, law
students will still be able to occupy Woods Creek.
Currently, sixty law students live in the East wing
of Woods Creek.

However, some students think the policy is
unfairto women. Underthe policy, sorority women
will be forced to live in university-owned housing
while sophomore fraternity men live in
fraternity housing.

Panhellenic president Suzanne Sharp said the
policy is biased against women. She said an infor-
mal poll found that 75 percent of sorority women
were opposed to the policy. The policy affects 100
percent of the women and only 15 percent of
the men.

“I think the university needs to find resourceful
ways of making Gaines more attractive than mak-
ing policy to do so.”

She said there is no reason for freshmen women
to sign contracts earlier in the year and should wait
until later in the year to make housing decisions.

lnterFratemity Council President Kevin Batteh
said he thinks women might not find Gaines and
Woods Creek as attractive as the fraternity houses.
He believes the sophomore housing requirement
will bring the issue of sorority housing to the
forefront.

Howison agreed. He said Panhellenic has to
decide whether it wants sorority housing or not.
When Panhellenic comes to the administration
about housing, the university will have an obliga-
tion to meet their needs.

Sharp said Panhellenic will discuss the possi-
bility of getting sorority lodges later this year. She
said the process will take several months.

Howison said that although there has been
student opposition, he said the policy will be in the
best interests of W&L’s future.

Junior Andrew Olmem disagreed.

“Once again the administration has decided to
suppress the students’ independence that has made
W&L famous.”

He said the policy will only make the deans
happy, but it will not benefit the student body.

“I think it should be the priority of Dean Howison
to foster student independence rather than to im-
prove the Lexington housing market.”

Sophomore William Haase said he understands
the reasoning behind the policy, but he thinks
people should not be forced to live in university
housing.

“The dorms can’t be that great if you have to
force students to live there,” he said. ‘‘I don’t like
the idea of forcing people to do anything. I like
choice.”

Freshman Cheryl Puzon said the policy is not
unfair to women.

“It’s guaranteed housing,” she said. “The policy
makes it easier for women to find housing and they
don’t have to pay as much.”

Dean of Freshmen and Residence Life Dennis
Manning said the policy will help to build commu-
nity. He said one of the most effective ways to
build community is to develop a sense of attach-
ment to a place.

“It [community] means sacrifice,” he said, “and
I don’t think this [policy] is a significant sacrifice.”

He said other schools have four year housing
requirements. He said it’s rare for students to have
the freedom and ﬂexibility of living where they
want to live for two years. Manning rejected argu-
ments that the policy would hurt student autonomy.

‘‘I don’t see this as being counter to the spirit of
student self—govemance,” he said,

Manning said there are times when obligation
to the university and community takes precedence
over self-interest. The policy will benefit the stu-
dents and the school.

“A sophomore housing requirement has the
potential to improve student life here. The whole
fabric of student life will be strengthened.”

U.S. Marines land in Somalia
again

On Tuesday, U.S. Marines opened the last phase of Operation United
Shield, the United Nations effort to restore democracy in Somalia. Ap-
proximately 2,000 U.S. and Italian troops have moved into prepared
fortiﬁcations along the shores of the Indian Ocean. Pakistani and
Bangladeshi soldiers who comprise the rear guard of the U. N. force that
once numbered 30,000 were scheduled to begin leaving through the U.S.
lines this week.

U.S concerned about South
African arms

The United States is concerned that the defunct biological and chemical
weapons program of South Africa will end up in the hands of a terrorist
group, according to government sources. The weapons program was
officially terminated in 1993 by F.W. de Klerk. Recently, the U.S.
government has been pressuring President Nelson Mandela to make sure
all of the weapons and research have been destroyed because intelligence
sources have reported that Libyan agents have been trying to secure
research from the defunct program.

Peso continues to struggle in
Mexico

On Monday, the Mexican stock market fell by 6.85% following last
week’s decline. Analysts claim that investors are unloading their stocks
because the government has failed to give them a clear indication of the
future of the country’s economic policy. Inflation continues to spiral out
of control as interest rates soar and the value of the currency drops.

Balanced budget amendment
delayed

Tuesday marked the final day of Senate debate over the balanced budget
amendment. At the day’s end, supporters of the amendment were still one
or two votes short of obtaining the two thirds majority needed for passage.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Doe postponed the vote until Thursday. The
amendment, which was approved by the House last month, is designed to
keep government from spending more than it raises except in wartime. The
fate of the amendment in the Senate will be decided by Sen. Sam Nunn of
Georgia and four other Democrats who have threatened to oppose the
amendment if it is not revised to prohibit the courts from interfering with
future congressional tax and budget measures.

 

Medicare cutback expected

Senate Finance Committee chair Bob Packwood announced on Mon-
day that in order to achieve a balanced budget the Medicare and Medicaid
programs will have to be drastically restructured. Senior citizens with
greater ﬁnancial security may be asked to assume higher premiums and pay
for more services independently. Also, the entitlement programs may be
reorganized to encourage more people to participate in health maintenance
organizations. Changes are expected to be included in the budget recon-
ciliation bill in September and will likely ignite Congressional debate.

Rosa Lopez gives testimony at
Simpson trial

On Tuesday, Rosa Lopez, a housekeeper in the Brentwood area,
testified that she saw 0.]. Simpson’s white Ford Bronco parked outside of
his mansion on the night of June 12th at 8:00 p.m. and later at 10:00 pm.
This bolsters Simpson’s alibi that he was home at approximately 10:15
p.m., when Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were murdered.
Lopez also claims to have heard men speaking outside of Simpson’s home
shortly after midnight, an hour after the former football star left his home
to go to the airport.

Virginia gun dealer pleads
guilty

On Monday, Paul David Petersen of Blacksburg, Va. pleaded guilty in
Roanoke federal court to conspiring to circumvent ﬁrearm laws with other
members of the Blue Ridge Hunt Club, a ﬂedgling militia. The group

Evans Dining Hall was the site of a Food Fair on Tuesday. Students were able to sample food from around the globe
and close to home. Wandering from table to table proved to be a nice change from a typical D-Hall meal.

 
 
  

      
   

   
  

   

Class of ’62

From STAFF REPORTS

Quality in U.S. industry is the topic
of the eighth lecture in the Class of
1962 Fellowship Lecture series.

Kipling M. Pirkle, an associate pro-
fessor of management at Washington
and Lee University,will speak in North-
ern Auditorium on March 7, at 7 p.m.
His speech is entitled “Taking Care of
Business: Observations on Quality in
U.S. Industry.” It and the reception
that will follow are open to the public.

The Class of 1962 Fellowship pro-
gram was established in 1987 with a
gift of an endowment to support the
scholarship and research of the under-
graduate faculty. The Class of 1962
presented the gift at its 25th reunion “to
acknowledge its indebtedness and grati-
tude to the University for the under-
graduate education it received and to
make an expression of the gratitude in
a manner that will benefit the Univer-
sity in a substantial way.”

The funds were awarded in con-

 W&I-h

junction with an approved full-year
faculty leave research project. Upon
completion of the leave year, each Class
of 1962 Fellow presents the results of
the project to the university’s faculty
and students. Pirkle is the eighth fac-
ulty member to be named a Class of
1962 Fellow.

Pirkle received his B.B.A. and
M.B.A. from the University of Geor-
gia, and his Ph.D. from Clemson Uni-
versity. He has been at W&L since
1989, where he teaches strategic man-
agement, human resource management,
total quality management, and statis-
tics in the university’s School of Com-
merce, Economics, and Politics. He
taught at Old Dominion University
from 1986 to 1989, and at Furman
University from 1984 to 1986. He is a
member of the American Society for
Quality Control, the Family Firm Insti-
tute, and the Southern Management
Association.

Hot Zone aunt‘-horispieakﬁs to W&L

From STAFF REPORTS

Richard Preston, author of the best-selling non-ﬁction thriller The Hot zone
will speak at Washington and Lee University on Thursday, March 9, at 8 p.m. i 1 .
Lee Chapel. The public is invited to attend.

Preston’s books had its origin as a 1992 New Yorker article he wrote about th -V
1989 crisis at the “monkey house” in Reston, VA in which some 600 recentl ii
imported monkeys began dying from what was identiﬁed as the deadly Ebola
virus. His graphic account of what went on during the top-secret U.S. Army
mission that shut down the research facility is both harrowing and alarming — i
comes at a time when the tropical wildemesses of the world are being destroyed,
and previously unknown viruses that have lived undetected in the rain forest for _.
eons are entering human populations.

L‘ Phi Movie Reviewer ‘K

Bullets over Broadway — ﬁt‘!

Despite receiving seven Oscar nominations,
Woody Allen’s latest ﬂick simply doesn’t live
up to our expectations.

Released several months ago, the film has
attracted little attention (it has only grossed
about ten million dollars). However, when it
received so many nominations, I decided to
give it a chance, hoping to stumble upon what
would become cult classic.

Unfortunately, Bullets over Broadway will
be remembered as little more a particularly
mundane film from a normally excellent direc-
tor.

John Cusack is struggling playwright David
‘Shayne, who is insistent that his latest script,
(“ad of Our Fathers, not be mangled by prima

onna actresses and greedy producers catering
to the lowest common denominator. He is an
artist, and he will not compromise his art for
anything.

Well, almost anything. As we know, life is
not perfect. Cusack can only get ﬁnancing from
a shady, none-too-artistic gangster, who insists
that his moll, Olive Neal (Jennifer Tilly), have
a major part in the play, a role too big for her
limited dramatic gifts.

But hope springs eternal, and Cusack man-
ages to round out the cast with a number of ﬁne,
slightly-past-their-prime actors and actresses,
including the majestic Helen Sinclair (Dianne
Wiest), a stage legend who hasn’t had a hit in
years.

To top off this volatile mix of ego and
artistry, the gangster/producer insists one of his
silent, scowling enforcers accompany Tilly to
rehearsals, to ensure that she gets treated right.
As a result, ‘Cheech’ (Chazz Palminteri) sits in
the back of the theater, occasionally threaten-
ing Cusack if he doesn’t respect Tilly’s meager
talents.

There are a number of intriguing sub-plots
that develop as the play works its way towards
a Broadway debut: Tilly falls for the leading
man, Cusack falls for the manipulative Wiest,
Cusack’s girlfriend falls for his good friend,
etc. Most importantly, it turns out that
Palminteri, far from being an unthinking brute,
is a pretty good artist in his own right. Cusack
ends up having him secretly re—write most of
the play, and critics unknowingly hail Cusack
as the greatest new talent of the decade.

As usual, Woody Allen has assembled a
tremendous cast to help him. Jack Warden, Rob
Reiner, Harvey Fierstein, and Tracey Ullman
all liven up the cast and do a ﬁne job. Similarly,
Cusack is excellent as the harried yet proud
young artist, showing a real comedic ﬂair, a
departure from his serious fare like The Grifzers.

Both Jennifer Tilly and Dianne Wiest (Par-
enthood) have been nominated for Best Sup-
porting Actress Oscars, and Tilly has a very
good performance, especially considering her
past roles in such movies as Made in America
or Johnny Be Good. But of the two it is Wiest
that truly deserves the award.

She makes the typical aging—starlet routine
much more interesting and full of life than we
would have expected from such a stock charac-
ter. Her manipulation and deviousness, com-
bined with her aging greatness and tenderness,
make a very moving, very real picture with just
the right comedic touches for this ﬁlm. Already
an Oscar-winner for another Allen picture,
Hannah and Her Sisters, Wiest would be an
excellent choice again this year.

The ﬁlm finds its downfall, though, in its
shoddy script. Written by director Woody Allen
and Douglas McGrath, the individual dialogue
and conversations sparkle with tension, humor,
and general reality. Plus, Allen shows no fear in
taking the movie in unexpected directions.

However, the ﬁlm as a whole rambles, mov-
ing in ﬁts and starts from one character episode
to another, without being a cohesive whole.
The characters aren’t developed fully enough
to drive the ﬁlm as a whole, and the result is
maddening. The picture refuses to move on its
own, so it keeps getting shoved in the back by
Allen every ﬁfteen minutes or so. Although
individual bits and pieces are enjoyable, it’s
simply annoying as a whole.

Despite some excellent scenes, commend-
able acting and the famous Allen name, Bullets
over Broadway simply doesn’t feel like a good
ﬁlm in the end. I think it will probably do very
well on network television, where its stop-and-
start qualities make it perfectly suited to com-
mercials. Until then, despite the Oscar nomina-
tions, wait till videotape — or better yet, if you’re
impatient and love comedies about the stage,
check out Mel Brooks’ hilarious The Produc-
ers, which is a thousand times funnier and
livelier than Bullets over Broadway.

Rating Scale

ﬁﬁﬁﬁr -Go buy thisassoon as itcomesout on video. It is an instant
classic. “You'll laugh; you'll cry; and maybe. just maybe, you'll
learn something about yourself."

ﬁﬁfr - Go see this ﬁlm now, while it‘s still on the big screen. lt’s
worth a few Oscar nominations and the seven bucks you'll pay if
you see it outside bexington. Overall. “Better than Cats!”

ﬁrir - Okay, so there have been better ﬁlms. Nevenheless, it is a
good example of its genre, and you should probably see it on
videotape. Still, probably “Better than Cats!"

it - It happens to be on HBO, and you're blowing off tomonow's
reading. Although your time would probably be better served on
your education, its free and you're bored. so go ahead and watch it.
E - Even if its free and your best friend said he never laughed
harder, trust me, this one sucks Don't waste your time, or at
least don't waste it on this. (There's always MTV.)

_ The high costs of Fancy Dress may deter some potential dates from

PAGE g

Phi Features Editor

lt’s ofﬁcial. It happens every year about this
time.

Fancy Dress mania has overtaken the Wash-
ington and Lee campus. Everywhere you go,
someone is talking about FD, hearing about
FD, or thinking about FD, W&L women are
scurrying for last—minute accessories to their
dresses, W&L men are making sure their Alvin-
Denis ﬂask is in operating order.
Freshmen are nervously anticipat-
ing their ﬁrst brush with
the “grand social event of
the South.” Seniors are
nostalgically reminiscing
about their past FD’s — the
good, the bad, and the ugly.

All the Fancy Dress hoopla is
enough to make even the goodest
of good ole’ boys or sweetest of
Magnolia queens sick to their stom-
ach —— at least, those without dates.

Yes, there are still many dateless
souls out there. Why do so many
people, described by one sympa-
thetic friend as “normal people,”
not have dates?

Depending on whom you ask, the answer
varies.

Some simply do not want to go. The cost is
rather prohibitive. When all is said and done,
FD-goers can spend upwards of $300. Tickets,
tuxedo rentals, dresses, expensive dinners, SAB
concert tickets, and spirits expenses are quite

 
 
  
  
  
  

popping the FD question.

Elaborate balls don’t appeal to some. Let's
face it, some actually prefer those obnoxious
and predictable band parties.

And what about those FD Steering Commit-
tee members? They’ve spent more time than
you can possibly imagine planning this event

. There’s a good chance many on the Com-
mittee have grown so exhausted with all the
preparation that when the ball arrives, the
thought of actually attending causes them to
vomit unoontrollably. You may roll your eyes

in disbelief, but see just how
long FD Chairman Joe
Frampton really stays at the
ball?
Unfortunately, some W&L
women don’t get asked. lt’s
possible the overwhelming
population of road cheese
present at the ball accounts
f o r this.

Why would some guys choose to
ask a non-W&Lwoman to FD? Every-
one knows that W&L girls are smarter,

more fun, more attractive, and more
sexy than any road school girl could
ever hope to be.

Yet still, a large number of girls
go unasked. Perhaps President-Elect
Elrod could issue an executive order

stating that no road school girl can be asked to
FD until all W&L women have dates.

Well, what does the FD dateless one do this
weekend?

The possibilities are as varied as the reasons
for not going.

the library dutifully studying.

A more popular alternative is to leave town
for the weekend. Washington D.C. is only
three-and-a-half hours away.

lt’s also a good opportunity to visit friends
at other schools. One could always go home
and visit the folks.

Whatever you do this weekend — be safe,
be smart, and have fun.

And remember one thing if you're one of the
dateless masses out there in W&L-land.

When this whole ordeal is over in four days,
no one will care or much less be able to recall
what you did this weekend.

Mark Mathabane paints beauty, sadness and pain

By

Staff Writer

 

As South Africa heads into the
new year with apartheid officially
abolished, the new government has
a number of challenges facing it.

One of those challenges involves

Men oftentimes physically abused
their wives or cheated on them.

More often than not South Afri-
can women had no choice who they
married.

Once lobola was paid, their hus-
bands looked upon their wives as
their possession—not as their
partners.Geli, Mathabane’s mother,
is forced to marry a man she doesn’t
love.

Her mother tells her that she can-
not marry her true love, David. In-
stead she must marry an older man.

“My mother went on to say that

She was a strict woman, very short
tempered, and ever since my father
left her she had been drinking heavily.
She would often beat me and my
siblings with aswitch if we disobeyed
her. But I was disappointed, troubled,
and hurt by her attempts to kill my
dream of marrying the man I truly
loved.”

Mathabane takes the reader into
the lives of not only his mother but
also his grandmother and sister. Tales
of abuse and witchcraft and struggle
abound in this book. His grandmother
talks about how her husband left her

Mark Mathabane poverty and life

looks at the lives of
three generations of
women in his family:
his grandmother, his
mother, and his sister.

In South African
culture, a man who
wants to marry a
woman must pay
lobola to the father.

Suitors paid lobola
with cows in ancient days.

Cows played an important role in
South African society; in fact, some
villages were built around cow pens.

These days, men pay for their
wives with cash money.

As Mathabane makes clear
throughout the book, women have
no rights under the lobola system.

Mathabane has
written a fine
book. He lets the
women tell their
stories. His voice
stays in the back-
ground, bringing
their voices forth. These women’s
lives are ﬁlled with sadness and pain.
Yet, I kept marveling at their strength
and beauty. Despite all they had been
through, they still survived and en-
dured. Mathabane has given his
reader's a gift: the gift of knowing
these women, their struggles and their
successes.

A he Dateless Wonder...

About this time every year the rumors begin to ﬂy around the
mpus. Whispers behind closed doors, when backs are turned:
1 hat do you mean, she doesn’t have a date? But, she...”
' nfortunately, highly available, beautiful, charming, intelli-
ent Washington and Lee women are left dateless every year;
1 hey are forced to go outside of the normally acceptable channels
to find escorts to the biggest party in the South. We have actually
heard W&L students bemoaning the fact they did not choose to
attend one of our women-only neighbors which surround us.
No wonder W&L women have their little prejudices against
women from all-women’s colleges; here we are, attending a
school at which the men outnumber the women two-to-one, and
yet we are not asked to the most important social event of the
year. Something is obviously wrong with our oft—1auded social
system. .
; Someone said to a W&L man, “y’all have so much power. You
' just don’t realize.” It is true. The men at Washington and Lee
5 have all the power, and use it so unwisely. At a small school such
I as this, it is truly amazing that some of the best prospects in
lanyone’s standards are left bringing their brothers’ friends or
‘their friends’ brothers, cadets, or old boyfriends shipped in from
fir away.
Qyhy this odd shortage of men? Are our standards too high? I
doubt it, somehow; though we can think of a few standard
‘excuses, eventually we run out and have to give in to the next
request. Are you afraid of our brains? Believe us, when everyone
has eaten and drunk and been merry, relative SAT scores matter
,to us less and less.

I am grasping at straws, perhaps, but something is wrong, at
least from the perspective of intelligent and lovely women at
W&L. Take another look around you, men, before desperately

‘(reaching for the available girls’ school girl. You may be sur-
prised at who is lonely and unattached, and lives only a few
meters away from you.

‘Congratulations are in order...

The trustees of Washington and Lee have selected a new
president, and have been very voluble in their support of him;
‘John Elrod was the unanimous selection of the Board of Trust-
ees, and everyone from members of student government to the
administration has been praising Elrod effusively.
g ,, John Wilson, our soon-to-be-retiring president, described
«I Elrod with the greatest respect.
“He has an infectious enthusiasm for life, learning and ideas;
he likes people, and he is a good judge of people,” said Wilson.
x“He will find himself speaking all over the country, representing
the University, and he has to reﬂect the values of the University.
He comunicates well, and that is a very important part of the job.”
Wilson also lauded Elrod’s honesty, a principle which he said
‘went beyond the honor system definition of a prohibition of
lying, cheating and stealing, but included a “courage of convic-
tions.”
Congratulations, John Elrod. If you live up to half of the
praises of the faculty and administration, you will be a great
president.

British Euroscepticism and America’s future

 
 
   
 

NICHOLAS L.
WADDY, ’96

As is the case with so many other
international trends, the Clinton
administration’s position on the emerg-
ing European Union is inconspicuous
at best.

It is a measure of American over-
conﬁdence, no doubt, that neither our
President nor our press feel compelled
to pay much attention to the current
debate in Europe over a single cur-
rency, for example, but unquestion-
ably such questions are of vital interest
to the United States. For if it transpires
that the European Union evolves not
into a loosely bound common market,
but into a united and purposeful federa-
tion of European states, then American
pre-eminence in the world will be ef-
fectively challenged for the first time
since the era before World War One.

One of the most telling indicators of
the true state of the old US—European
alliance came just this past week, even
though, characteristically, it too has
been largely ignored in the face of
more important developments within

the LA County Courthouse. The
French, with the acquiescence (one
assumes) of countries like Britain and
Germany, have proposed that economic
sanctions leveled against Serbia be
lifted in return for that country extend-
ing diplomatic recognition to the gov-
ernments of Croatia and Bosnia. It
may not look like it at first glance, but
this proposal actually signals the total
collapse of the NATO effort to end the
Bosnian War.

Economic sanctions against the
Serbian Republic are largely the only
effective means that NATO countries
have to put pressure on Serbian guerril-
las inside Bosnia. Now it is being
proposed that such sanctions be done
away with — not in return for the end
of ex-Yugoslavia’s bloody civil war,
but simply in return for a cosmetic
gesture on the part of the Serbians in
recognizing the Croat and Bosnian
states. In simple terms, NATO and
Greater Serbia for the past several
years have been giving each other the
evil eye —and this week it was NATO
that blinked.

All this is terribly signiﬁcant be-
cause NATO is the most tangible sym-
bol of the US-European alliance that
functioned so well during Cold War.
When NATO’s resolve and effective-
ness begin to fall apart, as now appears
to be the case, this surely is a sign that

the US-European relationship is chang-
ing, or perhaps becoming increasingly
neglected or irrelevant. This is, in fact,
much more dangerous for America than
it is for Europe, because for decades it
has been

the importance of the emerging Euro-
pean Union. If it is the goal of Ameri-
can strategy in the global arena to main-
tain American predominance, then we
have to face the fact in the EU we now

face the greatest poten-

If the US-European relationship
begins to change, it is a fair bet that it
will change in the direction of greater
European power and assertiveness —
leaving the status of American power
in some danger of becoming eclipsed.
Moreover, if a European superstate ever
did achieve a level of geopolitical
prominence equal to or greater than
that of the United States, there is no
guarantee that US—European relations
would always remain as amicable as
they are now.

What all this means, if I may be so
bold as to hazard an analysis, is that the
US is very foolish to ignore or discount

moral support to men like British Prime
Minister John Major. He, and his fel-
low Conservatives, make up one of the
few groups in Europe trying seriously
to put the brakes on the emergence of
an all-powerful EU. Major, by seeking
to stymie at least for the moment Con-
tinental moves toward a common cur-
rency, is making a gesture toward the
old system of independent—minded and
often mutually-disagreeable European
nation-states. As the American cen-
tury gives way to the unpredictable
21st, Americans might do well to pon-
der seriously the consequences of
Major’s looming defeat.

Proposed law

NOVA
CLARKE,
’96

 

It’s halfway through the first hundred days of the
Contract With/On America and do you know what
your Congress is doing? This past weekend I had a
chance to catch up on all the evils of the Republican
Congress, while I was at the Free the Planet Confer-
ence in Philadelphia. (Note: If you think I am
radical, you should have met some of the people
there) There are naturally many provisions that I
disagree with; but, I want to focus on three particu- '
lars of the Contract that I find particularly appalling.

First, “The Risk-Assessment and Cost—Benefit
Act of 1995” (HR 1022). This act doesn’t sound bad
on the surface; we don’t want to spend money on
basically useless programs such as Star Wars. How-
ever, this act doesn’t apply to useless military ex-
penditures; instead, it is directed toward environ-
mental and health regulations. The basic provisions
of the act state that on any new regulations a risk
assessment must be done to determine whether the
law will cost Americans more than $25 million
annually (which works out to 10 cents a person a
year).

I am not in favor of paying any more money to
the government than absolutely necessary; but, there
are many things this act doesn’t take into consider-
ation. For example, exactly how much is a human
life worth? Is it possible to do a cost-beneﬁt
analysis when one doesn’t have a monetary value
for one of the beneﬁts? The Clean Air Act probably
wouldn’t have passed the risk assessment test.
Exactly how many people across the country are
bothered by smog? It certainly isn’t really a prob-
lem in Lexington; but, For those people who were
troubled by bad air, the beneﬁts are innumerable
both to them and to us. These people can go to work

' and breathe properly, they are also productive,

which beneﬁts all of us in a way that can’t quite be
measured. On the other side, how do we know what
the actual cost will be to us of fulﬁlling the regula-
tion. Technology is advancing every minute and the
cost of fulﬁlling a regulation may constantly be

going down. I am not an economics major, so I
realize that there are probably some ﬂaws in the
argument; but, there are major problems with this
provision. If it does pass, though, I would love to see
a cost-beneﬁt analysis done on the Star Wars —like
initiative that the Republicans were trying to pass
earlier this year.

Next on the list is HR 9, “The Job Creation and
Wage Enhancement Act of 1995”. Another great
title that makes the act seem good for America.. The
specific problems lie in Titles III-XI. The bill
requires an enormous and time and money consum-
ing process of review prior to a regulation being
made into law. There are twenty-three individual
levels that a regulation must pass. The people on the
panels on the different levels come not just from
government; but, from the private sector and com-
panies that have monetary interest in seeing the
regulation killed. It doesn’t take an expert on human
nature to determine that the private corporations are
not going to approve a bill that hurts them, no matter
its other benefits.

The other problem is naturally the number of
steps it takes to pass the regulation. The Republi-
cans have been complaining about the number of
regulation we have now, and they are just adding
more bureaucracy. I ﬁnd it sort of ironic that it is
only a twelve step process to condemn a man to
death (a man’s case is reviewed by twelve individu-
als on a jury a combination of their opinions deter-
mines a person’s future); but a twenty-three step
process to pass a law that save so many. Perhaps I
shouldn’t ﬁnd this odd since the Republicans are
planning on repealing the basic meaning of the
Fourth Amendment.

Another provision of HR 9 is the takings section.
Takings is basically the requirement that the govern-
ment repay an individual for the loss of property
value he might have suffered due to a regulation that
prohibited him from using his land in a specific way.
This provision is wide open for abuse. Suppose, I
have a piece of otherwise useless land that I decide
to build a toxic waste dump on and it happens to be
right next to a children’s playground. Now I know
that the government is going to forbid me from using
that land for such a purpose (any sane human being
would). I wanted to make some money on the land
sol announce that the regulations are inhibiting my
ability to make an honest dollar and that the govem-
ment owes me money. Under the provisions of HR

s sound too good to be true

9, I would be reimbursed despite the fact that I knew
the plan would be shot down before I started. Of
course the Republicans may be basing this all on the
perceived virtue of public-spirited citizens who would
never do such a thing.

Finally an aspect of the Contract that I take very I

personally, cuts in education spending. The contract
requires a $13 billion cut in student aid programs over
a five year period. On of the methods of doing this is
to end the exemption in paying back loans while the
student is still in school. Now realistically, it is all I can
do to have some money to live on now. If as a graduate
student I had to start paying back loans, that would end
my graduate career. I might have to then fall back on
one of the surviving social programs, like food stamps.
If we want to move into the new technological age that
Newt hypes, we need people who are educated, not in
prison. It is a known fact that people who are the
beneﬁciaries of a good education and all the opportu-
nities it provides are less likely to end up in prison.
Perhaps this is what the Republicans want, some way
to justify the increase in prison spending by making
sure there are plenty of people to ﬁll them. I would be
interested to ﬁnd out how many of the Republican
members were the beneﬁciaries of delayed student
loans and Pell Grants.

Unfortunately, the Republicans are planning on
using the money not used on bettering our generation
in expanding the military. The 1994 budget of the
military (that we know about) was $281 billion, the
budget for all Federal education grant, loan, and work-
study programs was $31 billion. One of the recent
facts that has come up, speaking of cost-beneﬁt analy-
sis is, that the cost of one F-22 is the same as the
amount of money needed to provide Pell Grants for
113,000 students, and this money will be returned in
many ways, unlike a plane that will probably be
declared out of date in a few years. Of course the
builder of the F-22, Lockheed is in Newt’s home
district-—wait, I forget Newt is against pork so that
could have nothing to do with his decision.

The next few months will be key to seeing whether
the Republicans are able to turn back the clock on what
this country has accomplished. I won’t merely be
waiting to see what happens though, I intend to make
sure my opinion is heard and I hope all of you will too
no matter which way it leans. To make sure Newt
hears what you have to say you can always use the
advance technology he promotes and e-mail him at:
geogia6@hr.house.gov.

Don’t hate me because I’m beautiful

GREEN LAND
BETSY GREEN

hate

Don’! because
I’m beautiful.

Hate me because I’ve had an FD
date since November.

You all want to strangle me right
now, don’t you? I know I’m gloating,
but I can’t help it... This year’s FD
promises to be great, tres bien, even. So
with that in mind, welcome to a special

me

edition of Green Land: Betsy’s FD’

Anticipation Column.

The state of Virginia should regu-
late the week after February break as a
part of the hunting season. Hunting for
FD dates, that is. It seems that no one
can escape from the scrutiny of the
opposite sex. You should be careful,
though, or you might end up thinking
things like freshman Paul Byerly. ‘‘I
wonder if she has a date yet. Sure she’s
a Lee-Hi waitress, but it could be fun.”
Eitherthat or you’ll end up hanging out
at Shark’s looking for the Rockbridge
County High School boy with the
latest curfew.

I was lucky enough to escape all of
that trauma. Did I mention that I’ve had
a good looking, charming, fun-loving
date (he prefers to be called “Steve”)
for a really long time? I did? It irritated
you? Great, I care. In all seriousness,
though, I was really glad to be able to
avoid the turmoil of trying to find a
date. My guy friends appreciated it as
well. They knew that every time I
looked at them I wasn’t trying to guess
how they’d look in tuxes or where
they’d take me out to dinner. Mark
Tobias told me that I was one of only a
few women he could talk to about FD
without fear of violence. Most reacted
something like, “Don’t even talk to me

about Fancy Dress. Your girlfriend goes
to Sweetbriar, you traitor.”

If it makes you all feel any better, I
didn’t have a perfectly worry-free time
before FD. Since my date had to be
specially imported from Seattle, we
needed to look foraway to save money.
The answerseemed clear. I signed away
my life (okay, just 25 hours of it) to
Paducah Joe Framptom. I was an FD
contract worker.

It is profoundly ironic to me that I
did so much grunt labor and messy
work so that I can spend Friday as
glamorously as possible. With any luck
l’ll have all of the paint off of my hands
by then.

I began my contract work by selling
ads for the Playbill. I racked up a lot of
hours by talking on the phone and
saying things like, “Yes, l’ll hold, “I’ll
leave a message on his voice mail,” and
“Do you know when she’ll be back?” I
also spent a lot of time on hold. It’s a
bad situation of me since they usually
play Muzakiin the background. I start
out by humming along, then feel bolder
and start singing. By the time the per-
son I’m waiting for picks up the phone,
I’m usually in the middle ofa full song
and dance number to “Raindrops
Keep Fallin’ On My Head.”
Very professional.

A sick thing happens to you when
you become a contract worker. We are
insanely proud of tiny little details you
won’t even notice at the ball...unless
we have anything to do with it. Re-
member those little pieces of tissue
paper that were attached to your invita-
tion? I spent two hours with a hot glue
gun helping to make that possible. Ryan
Mooney, John Harding, and Tory Noto
are insanely proud of a fruit cart they
built and will probably spend all of FD
standing next to it and pointing it out
to everyone.

There is a definite gender gap when
it comes to contract work. While the
men are sweating and trying to carry
huge pieces ofthe stage (about equiva-
lent in weight to one ofthe belly danc-
ers from last year), the women are
working on papier machie and gossip-
ing about what they’re going to wear.
The guys don’t think its fair, and,
damnit, they’re right. I know because I
deﬁed my sex and helped carry those
big heavy things. The guys were im-
pressed with my toughness until I got
tired and started complaining that I
hurt my arm. Instead
of helping them lift,
I got a new job cut-
ting out twelve foot
lengths of paper to
coverthe small gym.
I pretty much rein-
forced all of their
gender stereotypes

Elrod could in-
crease his popu-
larity even more

Some of my brother’s lame friends at
Harvard started telling me how many
starving children could be fed with the
budget for paint alone. They all wanted
to know why we would take part in
such an obscene spectacle. My answer?
We do it because we can. Ask Profes-
sor Velasquez (who now actually reads
the Phi , and is hence worthy of being
mentioned in my column) and he will
explain to you the rationale for FD
based on the philosophies of David
Hume. Maybe that should have been
the topic of my latest paper.
Professor
Velasquez has fi-
nally relented and
is planning to go
to FD. Professors
at FD are cool.

out to me the best
thing about doing
contract work. You
get to be involved,
but you have no responsibility whatso-
ever. While Ashley Bell and Ann
Howard stressed about whether or not
it was going to rain on the stuff we had
painted, Beth and I took a break and
were simply happy to be getting
hours in.

I just read the description of the
decorations in the Playbill. If you were
trying to explain to someone what the
word “ostentatious” means, you’d do
well by just handing them that. People
at other schools are blown away by FD.

To the editor:

In our attempt to get more feedback from the
students on the Honor System, the Executive
Committee has placed boxes around campus
for your comments. Some of the most recent
comments deserve particular response.

Undoubtedly, the most difﬁcult part of this

job is finding someone guilty of an honor vio-
lation. No one on the EC thinks it is fun, no one
looks forward to a closed hearing, and no one
takes the matter lightly. This I assure you.
Having a friend withdraw after a guilty
verdict sucks. However, I promise you that the
Executive Committee will never ask a student
to leave ifwe think that you would notjudge the

students’ lives.

grees, but the Washington and
Lee baseball team was still at-
tempting towarrn upasit dropped
both ends of a doubleheader to
Mary Washington, 8-3, and 8-4,
in Fredricksburg, Virginia.

The two losses to the highly
rated Mary Washington squad
sank the Generals’ season record
to 0-4.

The Generals had little prob-

games, hitting .300 as a team in
the ﬁrst game and .375 in the

second. However, pitching woes,
in the form of 18 walks, proved
too much for the offense to over-
come.

Despite the losses, head coach
Jeff Stickley was satisﬁed with
the team’s overall effort.

“For the most part, [was
pleased,” he expressed. “We
swung the bats well, but just gave
up too many walks.”

W&L jumped off to a quick
start inthe first game. Senior
Geren Steiner ripped a single,
and crossed the plate on junior
Mark Sappenﬁeld’s two-out in-
ﬁeld single, giving the Generals
a 1-0 advantage in the ﬁrst.

The lead would not last long,
as the walk parade started in the
second inning. Junior starting
pitcher Graig Fantuzzi had

trouble ﬁnding the strike zone,
walking six batters in his three
innings of work.

Mary Washington took full
advantage of the walks, scoring
twice in both the second and third
innings, putting them in front, 4-

Junior Todd Garner relieved
Fantuzzi, but Garner got knocked
araound in the fourth, issuingfour
more free passes, as Mary Wash-

pad its lead to 8-1.

Sophomore Rob Boston was
ﬁnally able to tranquilize MWC’s
bats, as he did not allow a hit in
the ﬁnal two innings. The Gener-
als attempted a late rally as they

Both indoor track teams
showed up ready to make an im-
pression Saturday as the women
finished second behind
Lynchburg and the men were
topped only by Lynchburg and
Bridgewater.

For the men, the distance
events provided much of the spark
as Taylor Shultz, Grant Cowell,

Jason Callen, and Will Olson all
turned in stellar performances.

Shultz took second place in
the 1500 meter run while Olson
won the 3000. Grant Cowell was
second in the 800 and Jason
Callen took ﬁfth in the 800 and
3000.

The charge continued in the
pole vault as Harris Morrison was
the ODAC champion with a vault
of 14 feet, a full foot and a half

above the second place competi- '

tor from Lynchburg.
In the shot put, freshman Omar

Monheim took third with a ca-
reer best 39’ 11”.

W&L’s 3200 meter relay
squad also turned in a victorious
perfonnance, ﬁnishing 11 sec-
onds ahead of second place East-
ern Mennonite.

On the women’s side, the team
paced by senior captain Sue
Deutsch who brought home ﬁrst
place ﬁnishes in the 1500 and
3000 meter runs. Deutsch was
also a member, along with Nat
Messmore, Maren Wright, and
Kim Herring, of the winning 3200

Mary Washington closed out the
victory.

Washington and Lee was once
again victimized by big innings
in the nightcap. After a scoreless
first inning, MWC exploded for
five runs against W&L starter
junior Matt Ermigiotti in the bot-
tom of the second,although just
two of those runs were earned.

The Generals began chipping
away at the 5-0 deﬁcit, tallying
three runs to slice the MWC ad-
vantage to 5-3 in the sixth. But
once again, MWC ripped off a
big inning in the bottom of the
sixth.

Freshman Chris Pu gsley, who
had replaced Ennigiotti in the
fourth inning, was nailed forthree
runs in the sixth, giving MWC an
8-3 cushion before senior Bates

meter relay squad for the Gener-
als.

For her effort, Deutsch was
named runner-up for the meets
most outstanding performer
while scoring the fourth most
points in the meet.

Also taking ﬁrst for the Gen-
erals was the 1600 meter relay
team.

In the field, Sarah Gilbert
placed in three events. The se-
nior took third in the high jump,
fourth in the 55 meter hurdles,
and sixth in the triple jump.

This Week:

BASEBALL-VS. W. Va. Tech

Brown struck out the ﬁnal batter.

Facing another ﬁve run deﬁ-
cit, W&L once again attempted
to battle back. The Generals
plated a run and then loaded the
bases in the top of the seventh,
but Mary Washington escaped
the threat and held on for the 8-4
triumph.

Stickley attributed the pitch-
ing problems to a lack of experi-
ence.

“We hadn’t played a game in
a week and a half,” he pointed
out.

Despite both ending up as los-
ing pitchers, Ermigiotti and
Fantuzzi had no trouble from the
other end. Ermigiotti went 4-6 at
the plate in the twinbill, helping
to maintain a fantastic .727 bat-
ting average.

Coach John Tucker was
pleased with the performance.

“I think we did as strongas we
could have without two All-
Americans [Amy Mears,
Josephine Schaeffer] and a Na-
tional qualifier [Sandra
Holmes],” said Tucker.

Men’s coach Norris Aldridge
was also pleased with his team’s
performance.

“I thought that overall we ran
as well as we could have,” he
said. “We’re looking forward to
outdoor and hope we do well.”

Fantuzzi had been mired in a
slump earlier in the season after
tearing up opponents at a record
.482 clip in 1994, but he ap-
peared to regain his stroke fol-
lowing a 4-8 day.

The Generals’ scheduled con-

single game at 3:00 on Friday
afternoon will be followed by a
double header on Saturday, which
begins at 1:00.

“West Virginia Tech hits the
ball pretty well,” Stickley com-
mented. “We need to put the ball
in play and make them play de-
fense, and cut down on the
walks.”

story on page two.

Chi Psi sponsored a blood drive on March 9. Scott Dittman was one of those who volunteered to give blood. See

Washington and Lee faculty mem-
bers voted 83-3 in support of Winter
Rush in a meeting Monday afternoon.

The Student Affairs Committee re-
quested the vote to get an idea of what
the faculty thought about Winter Rush,
said Executive Committee President
Kevin Webb. He said the vote was
taken simply to gauge opinion and not
to implement Winter Rush next term.
SAC members will make recommen-
dations based on students’ opinions at
the April 3rd meeting. The faculty will
make a final vote in May.

In a four-hour meeting at Dean of
Students David Howison’s house, SAC
members voted unanimously to delay
any consideration of Winter Rush for
next year and approved the
InterFraternity Council’s condensed
Fall Rush program. Under the new IFC
plan, pledgeship would be completed
the week before Thanksgiving break,
and initiation would occur in the first
week of Winter Term.

Webb said the majority of faculty
members supported Fall Rush for next
year. He said Winter Rush would be
impractical next year because of the
Mock Convention and other events in
the academic schedule.

Howison agreed but argued that
Winter Rush would unify students and
give freshmen more time to decide

on fraternities.

In a statement made at the faculty
meeting, Professor of Physics H. Tho-
mas Williams cited several documents,
including the Coeducation Review
Committee Final Report and a two
year study conducted by the Univer-
sity of the South, as evidence that
supported Winter Rush. He said the
University of the South study surveyed
17 schools. Twelve of these schools
had Winter Rush and had had no prob-
lems with it, he said. He said W&L
should try Winter Rush. If it doesn’t
work, the university can always go
back to the old system, he said.

IFC President Kevin Batteh said
Winter Rush would distract freshmen
from theirstudies. He said Winter Rush
would hurt the house economically
because most of their money comes
from pledge dues. He said upperclass-
men would be pressured to maintain
house numbers. Fall Rush gives
pledges access to upperclassmen who

"can help them with classes, Batteh

said.

Panhellenic Council President
Suzanne Sharp said it’s important for
Panhellenic to support Greek life.
When 95 percent of men rush in the
fall, a larger percentage of women will
rush in the winter, she said.

Sophomore Kathleen Quirk said
Winter Rush would be unfair to the
freshmen. Freshmen would either feel
isolated from the W&L social scene or

Joe Frampton, head of the F.D.
Steering Committee, was very
pleased with results of this year’s
ball, giving special recognition
to his fellow committee mem-
bers and their efforts.

The committee, which had
been working since early Octo-
ber, had a few months, a $73,000
budget, and a great amount of
creativity and devotion, making
the 88th Annual Fancy Dress Ball
one of the most successful in
W&L history. Frampton esti-
mates that about 2500 people
turned out for the event, most of
whom were W&L students and
faculty.

Committee Vice—Chair Dan
Felton agreed with “Paducah Joe”
that the ball went “tremendously
well,” again giving credit to the
hard-working committee. Felton
felt that the success was due in
large part to the fact that the
members of the committee
“clicked,” though he jokingly
remarked that the “can-can danc-
ers were key.”

He said many on the commit-
tee worked well over one hun-
dred hours a piece, but noted that
they “do for the joy that it brings
to all the guests.”

Felton further noted the astro-
nomical sales of tickets and
memorabilia over any past year.

Most of the guests agree that

dent, who asked that his name

However, this year alcohol was
not as great a problem as it had
been in the past.

Head of W&L Security Mike
Youngcomplimented the student
body on a “quiet, well-managed

He was “very pleased” with
the outcome of the weekend, and
extended his gratitude to the stu-

$3 million gift brings
W&L closer to
campaign goal

By ETHAN KRUPP
Phi News Editor

The contributions President John Wilson and
his wife, Anne, have made to Washington and Lee
University were recognized by a $3 million gift to
the University from Frances and Sydney Lewis.

The Lewises, of Richmond, Va., are the co-
founders of Best Products Inc. and benefactors of

W&L.

“This gift is to honor the service John and Anne
Wilson have given socompetently and devotedly to
Washington and Lee over the past 13 years,” the
Lewises said in a statement announcing the gift last
Saturday at the Board of Trustees meeting.

The gift was revealed by Board of Trustees
Rector A. Stevens Miles when he interrupted a
report by Gerry benfest on gifts to the University.

The gift caught Wilson totally off guard.

“I just sat there, stunned,” he said.

The $3 million, which will be used for scholar-

ships and financial aid, is the latest gift from the
Lewises. They have been some of the University’s
most generous benefactors in the last 20 years. In
1972, they gave W&L $9 million for the construc-
tion of a new law school. They also donated an
additional $3 million over the years to support an
addition to the law school to hold the papers of U.S.
Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, establish
honor scholarships, and help other philanthropic
efforts of W&L.

Wilson said the gift helped W&L approach the

Trustees.

$31 million dollar goal for student ﬁnancial en-
dowment, a main target of the “On The Shoulders
of Giants” campaign.

Sydney Lewis graduated from W&L in 1940
and received his law degree from the law school in
1943. Lewis and his wife have both served as

Wilson said he would like to spend his final
months at W&L seeing “this campaign go smash-
ing through the top.” He said the gift from the
Lewises was a substantial help.

Hot Zone author offers to take ,
out Boston

By DAN ODENWALD
Phi Staff Writer .

A nervous laugh followed by si-
lence fell overthe Lee Chapel audience
as author Richard Preston held up the
tiny capsule.

The pinhead—sized black speck in
the center contained a tiny piece of
liver infected with the deadly virus,
Ebola Zaire.

“There’s enough Ebola in here to
wipe out one million people. We could
do Boston,” said Preston.

The acclaimed author of the best-
selling book, The Hot Zone, spoke
Thursday night to a packed audience
about his novel which described an
Ebola outbreak in a monkey house in
Reston, Virginia.

Ebola is the extremely lethal virus
that has the international science com-
munity bafﬂed and terriﬁed.

Since Ebola’s origins are unknown
and separate strains effect similar spe-
cies differently, the virus remains a
mystery to epidemiologists, those who
study viruses.

While the Reston strain of Ebola
wiped out the monkeys in the monkey
house, humans were unaffected.

However, the Ebola Zaire and Sudan
strains have been known to wipe out
entire African villages. More frighten-
ing still is that these strains are airborne
and can spread among human popula-
tions quickly.

Ebola kills its victim by liquefying
ﬂesh, turning organs into giant blood
clots, and causing the body to bleed
from every oriﬁce.

This process is known as “crashing
and bleeding out.”

The enigmatic and violent nature of
Ebola makes it one of the most serious
biological time bombs ever.

The United States had a near brush
with an Ebola outbreak when monkeys

with little media attention.

Enter Richard Preston. He stumbled
across the story while talking to virolo-
gists who were familiar with Reston.
He knew he stumbled in to any
reporter’s gold mine — a great and
little-known story.

“Coming across an explosive story
is like digging rocks and finding an
enormous cave lit only by your ﬂash-
light,” Preston said.

The reporter uses his “flashlight” to
gain knowledge and eventually know
the story like the back of his hand.

After extensive research, Preston
delivered The Hot Zone. The book was
fantastically successful. This week it
appeared at #3 on the bestseller list of
The Wall Street Journal and at #2 on
the bestseller list of the New York
Times.

Preston responded to questions
about critics who claim the book was a
plea to prevent the destruction of the
rain forests. (Preston hypothesized
that Ebola originated in the rain forest
and infected the human population
when humans destroyed its habitat.)

“This book wasn’t meant to stop the
devastation of the rain forests. It was
not written for political purposes,” said
Preston.

Preston also explained his theory
that viruses lethal to the human popu-
lation are nature’s way of thinning out
an expanding species nearing capacity.

“AIDS is not a natural accident.
Rather it’s a part of a continuous pro-
cess of disease emergence. lt’s nature’s
way of controlling the human popula-
tion,” said Preston.

Preston spoke on “biopolitics’ as
well. When Ebola broke in Reston, the
Center for Disease Control and the
U.S. military argued overwhich agency
would be responsible for managing the
crisis. Both believed they had jurisdic-
tion. Eventually, a compromise was
reached: the C.D.C. would deal with
the human component of Ebola, and
the military would handle the monkey
house.

In addition to government agencies,
individuals can battle with biopolitics.

Richard Preston shows off the gas mask he wore for pro-
tection from the deadly Ebola virus.

This was the case with the discovery of
the HIV virus. Both French research-
ers of the Louis Pasteur Institute and
Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Insti-
tute of Health claimed discovery of the
virus. After intense negotiations, they
agreed to share the discovery.

Preston added his belief that
biopolitics is in the best interest of the
American people.

‘‘It’s better to have two govemment
agencies ﬁghting over a crisis than for
them not to care at all,” said Preston.

Preston also said he believes an
AIDS vaccine will not come soon be-
cause of the hyper mutation the virus
undergoes while in the body.

“A person may die of an HIV strain

  
   
 
  
 

completely different from the strain
she caught,” said Preston.

When asked about a hypothetical
widespread outbreak of Ebola, Preston
does not anticipate a rosy scenario.

“The U.S. would revert to 18th cen-
tury medicine of quarantine and ﬂight.
Those infected would be shut off from
the healthy world, while the healthy
would ﬂee the cities for less populated
areas of the country,’ said Preston.

Richard Preston was graduated from
Pomona College in 1977 and received
his Ph.D. in 1983 from Princeton Uni-
versity. He contributes regularly to
The New Yorker. He has also wrote a
book about the cosmos and one about
the steel industry.

The Creative Dating Workshop will be held in
Dupont Auditorium on Wednesday, March 15 at 7:00
p.m. The workshop is sponsored by Student Activi-
ties Coordinator Michelle Richardson, Cable 9 Dat-
ing Game, Women’s Forum and
Panhellenic Council.

The Creative Dating Workshop was started in
1985 by Xavier University Student Activities Direc-
tor David Coleman, said Christine Ivanov, the pro-
moting and booking agent for the program. Coleman
developed the program after students asked him for
inexpensive and fun activities that didn’t
involve alcohol. I

Richardson said she thought the workshop would
help students socialize and meet people with-
out alcohol.

“I thought it would be interesting because Wash-
ington and Lee has a reputation for not dating.”

Senior and Channel 2 Dating Game host Chris
Albert said the workshop sounded like a fun activity.

“Creative Dating might give a new perspective on
dating on a small campus in a small town.”

lvanov said the program’s main goal is to give
students realistic options on how to improve their
relationships, whether romantic or platonic. Students,
particularly freshmen, are afraid to get involved in
school activities.

“Students often get stuck in a rut,” she said. “They
get ﬁxed on one social idea. We try to get them while
they’re young.” -

lvanov said the program is tailored for each cam-
pus. Creative Dating tries to get presenters who have
a feel for a particular school’s social scene, she said.
Issues such as AIDS and alcohol abuse might be more
emphasized at one campus than others, she said.

She said new ideas are always generated from
campus visits. Creative Dating does a 100 colleges,
she said. She estimated that they’ve visited 50,000
students in approximately 48 states since 1985. She
said they’re working on visiting Hawaii and Alaska.

lvanov said the program is interactive and lasts an
hour and a half. Students participate in various activi-
ties and see slides. She said the program is sensitive
to the political climate of a school while at the same
time helping students improve their relationships.

“We respect each campus’s philosophy, but we
still get the message across.”

“I think it’s up to the student body to decide what’s
right for them,” said senior Yabiz Sedghi.

Senior Goose Garrigus agreed.

“I think it’s important to get faculty members’

Webb said it was important to get faculty mem-
bers’ opinions on winter Rush to give the student
body a chance to respond.

Webb said he wants students and faculty to work
together instead of against each other on
winter Rush.

“Student autonomy is the most important charac-
teristic of W&L,” he said. “We shouldn’t take that
away from the students.”

The Sn awsn an/t
Redemption
cxplorcs issues
with poisc,
concern

  

By KIRK SUsoNG~———— 
Phi Movie Reviewer

 

The Shawshank Redemption — sfritriﬁr 1/2

The Shawshank Redemption is another
movie that sprang stillborn from the studio; it
has received very little attention from the pub-
lic. However, when it was nominated for sev-
eral Oscars, including Best Picture, I decided to
give it a try. Although it might be difﬁcult to
ﬁnd in a theater, go see it soon, before it
disappears.

The prison-break genre has produced some
of the best movies ever made, such as Papillon
or The Great Escape. The Sha wshank Redemp-
tion is in the same tradition and richly deserves
a place alongside those earlier ﬁlms.

As usual, the protagonist is a man wrongly
convicted, this time for killing his adulterous
wife and her lover. But Andrew Dufresne (Tim
Robbins) is more than just innocent; he is also
a clever and persistent man who was once a
bank vice—president.

When he arrives at Shawshank Prison in
Maine, he quickly becomes something of a
loner and makes enemies. When he ﬁnally gets
around to talking to someone, he develops a
friendship with Ellis “Red” Redding (Morgan
Freeman), the man-who-can-get-things. Deal-
ing in the currency of Lucky Strikes and Ches-
terﬁelds, Freeman is a respected man in prison
circles, as far as these things go.

When the prison warden (corrupt, naturally)
discovers that Robbins is ‘good with numbers,’
he decides to make use of his free labor. First
the warden just has Robbins do his taxes, then
all the guards’ taxes, and eventually Robbins is
doing taxes for most state employees within the
region.

But then the warden gets grander ideas. He
decides to go into business using convict labor
— not just Robbins but other prisoners as well.
Eventually the warden is getting so many kick-
backs and bribes that he develops intricate bank
accounts, fake companies, and even phantom
partners to launder all the dirty money. Behind
the whole house of cards is, of course, Robbins.

But the plot simply serves as a framework to
explore a number of interesting issues: the
walls of prison and the walls of the soul; acqui-
escence and anticipation; pity and sorrow; joy
and failure; displacement and familiarity; the
innocence and guilt of both men and their
system; and, most importantly, hope and resig-
nation.

So what really drives the movie is not the
direction (though Frank Darabont does a ﬁne
job) nor the story line (adapted from a Stephen
King story), but the wonderful acting that ﬁlls
out the very human characters. For example,
Tim Robbins (The Player) is very expressive as
Andy Dufresne.

However, even better than Robbins is Mor-
gan Freeman (Unforgiven,DrivingMissDaisy)
as Red. This is Freeman’s third Oscar nomina-
tion, and he richly deserves to win. Admittedly
his character is sympathetic and likable, but we
shouldn’t allow that to lessen the power of his
acting.

He carries on with a certain monarchal wis-
dom and dignity; his character is unﬂappable.
This makes his occasional outbursts all the
more powerful. Freeman is so reﬁned and re-
served he is able to make his narration at the
beginning of the ﬁlm work, instead of being a
shoddy excuse for character development.

It’s interesting to look at the Oscar ﬁeld this
year. Both Forrest Gump and The Shawshank
Redemption are ‘feel-good’ films, full of senti-
mentality and weepy emotion — almost maud-
lin. It is amazing to see that the lesser (by far) of
these two ﬁlms received so many more nomi-
nations (by far); could the Academy have been
swayed by the fact that Gump was a greater
commercial success (by far)?

The Shawshank Redemption explores a num-
ber of issues with poise and carefully-ordered
concern, keeping it all together within a coher-
ent story populated with superb acting. This is
a ﬁlm you will not want to miss on the big

" screen. It is deﬁnitely worth a drive to Roanoke

“On it everyone you
love, everyone you know,
everyone you ever heard
of, every human
being who ever

was, lived out their

of our joy and suffer-
ing, thousands of
confident religions,
ide010gieS...every saint
and sinner in the history
of our species lived there

—— on a mote of dust sus-

pended in a sunbeam.”

In Pale Blue Dot, Carl
Sagan describes the vision of
a human impact on the Cos-
mos.

The book begins, however,
by debunking many ancient
and modern predisposition re-
garding the Universe.

In what Sagan calls “The Great Demotions,”
he outlines how we have come from being the
center of the Universe and the ultimate reason

readers.

  

In the long awaited
sequel to Cosmos, Sagan
once again does his best
to capture the minds and
imaginations of his

for Creation, to mere passengers on a ship that
might not even be the only springboard for life
in the Cosmos.

With scientific logic, Sagan details the
changes that must take place within our civili-
zation before we can truly reach out to the stars.

Without global cooperation, many of the
long term goals for space exploration will be
unattainable.

In his unique style of making science attain-

able to the average reader, Sagan lists the tri-
umphs of the Voyager probes (including the
pictures from beyond the
Solar System of the plan-
ets that sparked the be-
ginning passage) and
other exploratory mis-
sions to the stars.

Sagan has completed
another successful step in
educatingthe public about
space and science in gen-
eral.

One of the key ele-
ments in the book, al-
though sometimes a bit
subtle, is Sagan’s opti-
mism for the human spe-
cres.

Despite gloomy pre-
dictions from some, he
states the possibilities for
our clan as we attempt to
catch up with the technol-
ogy we have created.

One example of our
possibility lies in the Voy-
ager probe itself.

For a civilization finding the craft at
some time in the future, the ship would repre-
sent to them a culture that was curious, explor-
atory and open-minded.

While now this may not be the case, Sagan

. O l

presents the possibility that it may be the case;
once we learn how to cope with our abilities, we
may attain that level.

“There are people who were born before
there was such a thing as an airplane, and who
in old age saw four ships launched to the stars.

For all our failings, despite our limitations
and fallabilities, we humans are capable of
greatness.”

Sagan, a master at bringing science torthe ..

attention of the general public, has possibly
improved upon his immensely popular Cosmos
with Pale Blue Dot.

The book also does an excellent job of
confronting some of the physics behind mod-
em space exploration without either glossing
over it or going into esoteric detail.

Most would hope that we survive to see
some of Sagan’s predictions for our future

Farai Chidega GCDLJRRS Culural misinformation

By MICHAEL
. HEWLETT
' ‘ Phi Staff Writer

  

When fonner Clinton nominee,
Lani Guinier, spoke at Lee Chapel a
few weeks ago, she noted how much
of our political discourse is domi-
nated by “drive-by debating.”

When discussing social ills, we,
as Americans, tend to buy quick ex-
planations without realizing the is-
sue may be more complicated than
we expect.

Oftentimes, politicians throw out
labels like “welfare queen”, “quota
queen”, etc. to stir up controversy
and no one questions what these la-
bels mean or even if they reflect
reality.

Farai Chideya, author of Don ’t
Believe The Hype: Fighting Cultural
Misinformation About African-
Americans, debunks many of the
popular notions about African-
American life with a wealth ofstatis-
tics and facts culled from various
sources.

Chideya paints a media that ﬁnds
it easier to rely on racial stereotypes
instead of attempting to ﬁnd thetruth.

The newspapers tend to focus on
the negative aspects of African-
American life instead of doing more
positive stories.

Although stories on
welfare invariably
show blacks receiving
assistance, she points
out that in sheer num-
bers, whites make up
the majority of welfare
recipients.

Newt Gingrich and
company may com-
plain about the evils of
the “liberal welfare sys-
tem”, but Chideya
points out that welfare
takes up less than one
percent of the federal
budget.

She also criticizes
Charles Murray’s The
Bell Curve, arguingthat
a number of factors af-
fect one’s place in soci-
ety.

“In fact, intelligence
is not an absolute quan-
tity at birth, but depends
on acombination ofge-
netics and environ-
ment, especially the
level of stimulation
given babies and tod-
dlers while the brain is
developing.

“ By some estimates, the major-
ity of Americans with mental retar-
dation are not born that way but
suffer permanent neurological dam-

age as a result of being
understimulated—for example. be-
ing left alone in their cribs all day
withoutbeingfrequentlytouched and
spoken t0...A whole host of factors

otherthan genetics de-
termine the future in-
tellectual capacity of
America’s children.”

The media further
concentratetheiratten-
tion on crime and drug
usage among blacks
when the majority of
violent crime and drug
usage is committed by
whites.

Yet, Chideya never
point this out. When-
ever the newspapers or
T.V. station does a
story on drug use, it
invariably shows
blacks—not whites.

Stories on welfare
depict blacks even
when the reporter ad-
mits that the vast ma-
jority of welfare re-
cipients are white.

What Chideya
points out is a unfor-
tunate reality in jour-
nalism.

Some reporters
find it easier to write
about urban decay
rather than urban renewal.

They don‘t see much value in
reporting on people who work hard
to provide for their families and pre-
serve a future for their children and

grand-children.

Yet, this underreporting of positive
things occurring in the black commu-
nity creates a climate where racial ste-
reotypes ﬂourish.

One of the problems is low percent-
age ofblack reporters on predominantly
white newspapers.

Forty-five percent of all newspapers
have no non—white empl0yees,and black
journalists make up only 5 percent ofall
newspaper reporters.

Chideya says this partly accounts for
the shoddy coverage of the black com-
munity.

The other reason is the sheer refusal
of some newspapers to simply become
moresensitiveincoveringminoritycom-
munities.

Chideya, a former journalist for
Newsweek, offers a striking picture of
black community that is often ignored
by the mainstream media. She gives
clear and insightful explanations about
afﬁrmative action, crime, welfare, po-
litical correctness and multiculturalism.

Although the book is full of statis-
tics, Chideya never allows herselfto be
bogged down with numbers.Like any
journalist,she writes sothatthe ordinary
reader can understand.

This is an informative and important
book. As Chideya makes clear, no one
can discuss the fractious issue of race
relations until one has the facts.This
book goes a long way in demystifying
the hype.

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

Gender equity at W&L?

Only a short 10 years after women began walking down the
colonnade for purposes other than social ones, we have acheived
something that one alumnus told me would never happen;
gender equity in Washington and Lee’s hallowed “Big Four.”

Made up of the chairman of the Student Conduct Committee
and the president, vice president and secretary of the Executive
Committee, the “Big Four” has traditionally been mostly, if not
all, male. In fact, only one woman has ever been a holder of any
of these four offices.

But today, for the first time in the short history of coeduca-
tion at W&L, two of the four offices are being held by women;
with Amy Gorham as EC secretary and Madeline White as SCC
chairwoman.

Women have had no trouble becoming an academic and
social force at W&L, and if fact have become campus leaders
in many respects on the campus (the publications, for instance,
are virtually monopolized by women) but have been very slow
to become political leaders. Many times in recent years, there
have been very well-respected and experienced women candi-
dates for offices, but every time but one they failed.

Of course, no woman has yet been able to achieve the highest
office at W&L, that of EC president, but as one student pointed
out, the ratio of men to women in the Big Four now outweighs
the ratio of men to women at Washington and Lee.

Many female alumni of W&L darkly predicted that this day
would never come; the campus, they said, was too traditional,
too conservative, too Southern, to let such a thing ever happen.
But the “gentlemen” at Washington and Lee have let two
women into their ranks, and we can only praise the progress the
campus has made.

We are not sure to whom the credit is due in this unprec-
edented step, but we must be grateful. Washington and Lee is
now more equitable than the United States government, all U.S.
business schools, the corner offices of Forture 500 companies,
leadership positions in administration at virtually every univer-
sity in the country and the Supreme Court, to name a few.

Never thought of it that way, did you? The women at
Washington and Lee are only roughly one-third of the popula-
tion, but we certainly have nothing to complain about in the
small protected environment of W&L politics. It is almost a
shock to someone who, her freshman };year, listened to losing
woman candidates mutter under their breaths L about the
unﬂinchable, iron-walled “good ol’ boy” network which had
prevented the entrance of women into anything but their social
lives.

It is, however, a positive shock, and The Ring-tum Phi
congratulates Amy Gorham and Madeline White, as well as
their male counterparts. Like the ad says, you’ve come a long
way.

Quote of the Week...

“It’s kind of like seeing someone at the gym...it’s
never the same again.”

Court trip means more than classwork

FAR MIDDLE
ALEX CHRISTENSEN

Last Tuesday night around 11:30 p.m., after labo-
riously—-er, at least carefully--preparing a presenta-
tion for Philosophy class the next day, I got a call from
Andrew Schneider, undergrad president of the ACLU.
It seemed he and the law school ACLU president had
reservations for seats to watch oral arguments in the
case of Rosenberger v. University of Virginia at the
Supreme Court the next day. But the law school-side
president was sick.

Now, this presented an obvious dilemma. I had
three classes the next day. I had a quiz in Religion,
plus that Philosophy presentation.

Actually, thinking about it now, I probably wouldn’t
call it a “dilemma,” exactly. I called to leave a mes-
sage on my Religion professor’s voice-mail. Surpris-
ingly, at midnight, he answered his office phone, so I
was able to explain the situation to him and arrange to
take the quiz later. My Philosophy professor, how-
ever, was apparently not even on the voice-mail
system, so I wrote an explanatory note and left it on
his door right before we left--at 4:30 Wednesday
morning. i

The Supreme Court is truly beautiful. I can’t tell
you if it’s really architecturally signiﬁcant, or even
well designed, but it is beautiful. Climbing up those
marble steps (especially walking slightly arrogantly
past the waiting throng who somehow did not get
reservations) is a feeling essentially indescribable.
Black-and-white pictures of Thurgood Marshall and
Linda Brown headed in forBoard ofEducation, Sarah
Weddington on her way to Roe, Gregory Lee Johnson
burning his ﬂag right...there!...Well, it’s aplace where
justice is done--or has been done.

Ronald Rosenberger was a student at the Univer-
sity of Virginia when he started Wide Awake Produc-
tions to publish student views from a Christian per-
spective. A first-issue letter from the editor stated
their aim as challenging students to walk in the way of
the Lord. Rosenberger applied to the student council
for funding of his magazine. The council funds 118
groups each year, including those published by Jew-
ish and Muslim student groups. Wide Awake was
denied its $5800 request on the grounds that it vio-
lated the establishment clause of the First Amend-
ment.

Rosenberger sued. The 4th Circuit sided with the
University of Virginia. On Halloween, 1994, the
Supreme Court granted certiorari, setting the stage
for, as Pat Buchanan might describe it if he were a
liberal hothead instead of a reactionary one, one of the
greatest acts of legal cross-dressing in history.

Professor Michael McConnell of the University of
Chicago, a former Brennan clerk, argued the case for
Ronald Rosenberger. In line with recent Supreme

Court decisions occasioned by suits brought by agents

of the Religious Right, he made the case that speech
is speech, whether religious, anti-religious or non-
religious, and that presenting Christian viewpoints

was just as valid and worthy of funding as any
other viewpoint. Essentially, he said, the case
boiled down to nothing more than viewpoint dis-
crimination. If the University of Virginia wished
to sponsor efforts at student journalism, it should
do so no matter what the content of the speech.

L In my opinion, McConnell’s formulation is
bogus. To say that funding every kind of speech
except the religious (and as an extension, the
blatantly anti-religious) treats religion in a some-
how less than neutral way simply ignores the First
Amendment. Giving money to a religious activity
clearly violates the establishment clause.
McConnell’s argument that funding the Muslim
and Jewish groups’ publications pointed up some
logical ﬂaw is incorrect as well. They did not
advocate religious practices or living a religious
life as Wide Awake clearly did. A question from
the team of Justices Souter and Scalia pointed this
out; it forced the University of Virginia through its
representative, Professor John Jeffries, Jr. of the
University of Virginia, a former clerk for W&L’s
own Lewis Powell, to admit that their standards
would permit funding of a hypothetical journal
that dealt with issues in Christianity without advo-
cating (or campaigning against) any of
Christianity"s tenets. I believe that in going any
further, the government would step into a gray,
foggy realm in which it may be directly manipu-
lated by religion.

Surprisingly, Jeffries barely touched on this
argument in his presentation for the University of
Virginia. He started out simply, and exclusively,
making the argument that with a limited budget,
the student council simply could not fund every-
one. Therefore, they must be permitted to make

their choices. This was a disastrous way to begin his
argument. The justices immediately jumped on him for
it. Discrimination by a public university is not permit-
ted. Jeffries seemed to be making the case that the I
council could pick and choose on any basis at all, which I
might include religion, sex, race, or hated viewpoint. 
After that losing skimiish, Jeffries recovered admira- 3
bly, assisted by Justice O’Connor, who seemed really 1
to want to hear a strong argument here, and made the ;
case that Wide Awake was not merely a magazine ;
presenting a Christian viewpoint, but really a prosely- «_
tizing publication, in essence a religious activity sim- ;
ply deﬁned, and therefore ineligible to be funded. I
Jeffries made some strong points that seemed to be 1
well taken by the justices, but McConnell was, overall, ;_
smoother and more in-control logically. ;
Luckily, oral arguments are not necessarily the 1
deﬁning moment in deciding cases. The Court will 1

consider this case and should cotne out with a ruling by 1
June. There is really very little predicting with any 3
accuracy that can be done. Voting to uphold the 4th {
Circuit ruling against Rosenberger will almost cer-:
tainly be Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and perhaps Breyer. 2
Voting to overtum will almost certainly be Justices Zj
Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas. So the deciding votes I;
will belong to JusticesO’Connor, Kennedy and Souter. 2
While this Court does not have a stellar record in?
upholding the separation of church and state, they have 
also exhibited a tendency to swing back to tradition and ,2
precedent after too long a radicalization, as with the .3
Webster case, where they essentially upheld Roe v. t.‘
Wade explicitly for the ﬁrst time, thought it had already I
been substantially eroded. Maybe Rosenberger will be I
the case in which they return to common sense on the I

First Amendment.
Anyway, it was worth the ‘F’ in Philosophy.

Funk and eggs dinner at Lee-Hi

 LAND
‘ Richard Weaver

One of my favorite Fancy Dress

weekend activities took place before
the actual ball. On Thursday night I
went to the Ramada Inn in Lexington
and knocked on the door of room 210.
5 Gary, one of the P-Funk All Stars,
let me inside. George Clinton was ly-
ing face down on the bed. All around
the room were dozens of marbles, the
kind you shoot in your slingshot or
something.
'_ Gary woke up George, who sat up,
nodded to me and said hello. He got up
and went in the bathroom and changed
into a red jumpsuit and a Parliament T-
shirt. When he came out I asked him
where he gets his clothes.

3, “When we make a video, they give
us these clothes,” he said. He then
braided his multi—colored, hip-length
braids together. Then he put them in a
semi-bun on his head and put on a
trench coat. We were ready to go to
Lee-Hi truck stop for dinner.

Accompanied by Frog, the newest
member of the P-Funk All Stars, we
walked to the hotel elevator. I asked
George what he was hungry for, and he
said he couldn’t have much, because

he’s on the Slim-Fast diet.

“Are you going to do some of those
commercials afterward, like Kathie Lee
Gifford?” I asked.

photo session with
several W&L stu-
dents who hap-
pened to have their
cameras with them
at their tables, we left Lee-Hi and
headed for the Pavilion.

George popped in a cassette of the
Jack/Beanstalk song they had just re-
corded in Atlanta. He and the All Stars

rapped along as we passed bee Chapel.

At the Pavilion George went to his
dressing room. I waited outside with
cameraman Will Olson to do a quick
interview for Channel 2. We met
George’s daughter, as well as some
very strange people walking around
wearing various combinations of se-
quins, cowboy hats, velour, etc. Some
of them were already dancing.

We knocked on the dressing room
door again, where there was a distinct
smell that I don’t think was cigarette
smoke. We walked in, camera rolling.
Inside, to the right sat a naked P-Funk
All Star. We ignored him.

George motioned to us to come
over. We did a few questions before he
got his own microphone, left and
walked on stage. He had left the
Mothership at home.

Later on that night I checked my
answering machine, where George’s
publicist had left a message to the
effect that I had better give him back
by 8:30 or" she was going to be very
disappointed.

Luckily, none of us were disap-
pointed. George Clinton was very
friendly, very nice, and an excellent
musician. He put on an incredible per-
forrnance, fueled by that Lee-Hi cot-
tage cheese. Almost makes you want
to be a rock star.

Baseballsquad nets ﬁrst two wins versus West Va.Tech

By Scorr BOOKWALTER
Phi Assistant Sports Editor

The Washington and Lee
baseball team played a major
league-like schedule this week,
playing a total of five games in
six days.

However, the Generals ﬁn-
ished this stretch in decent shape,
winning two of the first four
games to raise their season log to
2-6, before being rained out in
the ﬁfth game.

The Generals captured two of
the three games in a series this
weekend with West Virginia
Tech at a frigid Smith Field .
W&L edged out a ﬁve-inning 3-
2 triumph on Friday afternoon in
a contest stopped because of mis-
erable weather, and recorded a 4-
2 victory in the first game of a
doubleheader on Saturday, be-
fore getting stomped, 14-5, by
Golden Bears in the second game.

The Generals, at 0-4, were
still searching for their first vic-
tory of the season when Brett
Hartman trotted out to the mound
on Friday. He did not walk off
until the game and the losing
streak were ﬁnished, as the se-
nior went the distance, collecting
three strikeouts while yielding
only three hits in his ﬁve innings
of work.

“Brett threw strikes and kept
them off balance,” head coach
Jeff Stickley commented.

Senior Duane Van Arsdale
provided Hartman with a lead to
work with in the first inning as he
singled home j unior Owen Smith,
who had been hit by a pitch.

W&L added a second run in
the second inning as junior Will
Jordan and Mark Sappenfield
smacked consecutive doubles.
Junior Greg Fantuzzi manufac-
tured what proved to be the win-
ning run when he ripped a two
bagger, stole third base, and

crossed the plate on a grounder
by Smith.

Those three runs were all
Hartman would need as he re-
mained in command until the
game was halted in the ﬁfth.

Inthe ﬁrst game ofthetwinbill
on Saturday, Matt Ermigiotti fol-
lowed up Hartman’s impressive
pitching performance with a gem
of his own. The junior hurler
picked up the win by allowing
the Golden Bears only two runs.

Smith and Fantuzzi teamed
up again to jumpstart the Gener-
als to a 1-0 lead in the first, as
Fantuzzi walked and rounded the
bases following a Smith double.

Shoddy defense by West Vir-
ginia Tech allowed W&L two
more runs in the second as senior
Todd Stanton and sophomore
Tucker Bixby both scored as a
result of the error.

Junior Preston Miller lofted a
sacrifice fly which scored
Ermigiotti for the General ’s ﬁnal

mark.

Trailing 4-0, the Golden Bears
jumped back into the game in the
fourth inning, scoring twice on
two hits, to pull the margin to 4-
2, but the Generals held their
ground to win by the same mar-
gin.

It appeared as if history would
repeat itself as Fantuzzi came out
to the mound ﬁring to start the
second game. He rolled into the
fourth inning working on a 3-0
shutout, and the Generals could
smell a three game sweep.

However, things quickly fell
apart for W&L in the fourth. Af-
ter Fantuzzi loaded up the bases,
West Virginia Tesh ’s Joe Craffey
stepped up to the plate and blasted
a grand slam over the right field
fence to suddenly give the Golden
Bears a 4-3 advantage.

The grand slam provided a
180-degree change in momen-
tum as the Golden Bears released
the frustration that had been built

up from the previous two games,
and began scoring runs by the
bushelful. When the dust cleared,
West Virginia Tech had left Lex-
ington with a 14-5 thumping in
their pockets.Despite the ﬁnal
game, Stickley was satisﬁed with
the Generals’ play in the series.

‘‘I’m pretty happy that we
came out with two wins,” he
stated. “Our pitchers did a nice
job, and we played good de-
fense,”

W&L returned to Smith Field
on Tuesday afternoon to host
Holy Cross, but the Division I
power proved too tough for the
Generals to handle as Holy Cross
whitewashed W&L 7-0.

Senior Bates Brown had his
stuff working for him early, and
after three innings, W&L trialed
trailed by just 1-0 .

However, as in previous game
with West Virginia Tech, the roof
began caving in on the Generals
in the fourth.

Men’ s Lacrosse readies for W&L Tournament

By KEITH GRANT
Phi Staff Writer

The second annual W&L
Tournament opens Saturday as
the Generals take on conference
foe Randolph-Macon College.

That battle of Old Dominion
Athletic Conference rivals gets
underway at 3:00 on Wilson
Field, following the opening
game between Trinity (CT) and
Swarthmore at noon.

Randolph-Macon enters the
weekend ranked 24th in Divi-
sion Ill, one spot behind Trinity.
The Yellow-Jackets are 1-1 in
‘95, having beaten Shenendoah
on Wednesday.

Last year, the Generals
trounced R-MC 18-8 in the
ODAC ﬁnale to claim their sec-
ond-straight conference champi-
onship.

the eleven meetings between the
two schools.

The noon match-up will be
the season opener for Trinity (9-
5 last year).

Swarthmore, trying to re-
bound from a 2-14 ‘94 campaign,
lost their first game by a 13-9
margin to Westchester.

The Garnet met the Generals
in last year’s W&LToumament,
falling 17-2.

Having avenged their only
conference loss of the 1994 sea-
son, W&L is off to a 2-0
start.Junior Duncan Slidell scored
in overtime to give the seventh-
ranked Generals a 7-6 win Satur-
day at Hampden-Sydney.

The Tigers had taken a 12-6
decision last season to open the
Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence schedule, a loss from which
the Generals were able to re-
cover to successfully defend their

ODAC championship.

Sophomore goalie Doug
Gubner stopped 14 shots in
Saturday’s defensive battle, four
shy of his career-high.

This year’s Tigers, ranked
15th nationally, are anchored by
a number of key returnees. Lead-
ing the way is All-American Ed
Curry, who racked up ﬁve goals
against the Generals in last year’s
meeting.

Saturday, though, Curry was
held to just two scores, one on an
extra-man opportunity. Respon-
sible for shutting down
Hampden—Sydney’s main threat
was senior defenseman Mike
Kronthal.

Kronthal drew the assignment
in just his second career start
when All-American teammate
Shaun McKenzie was injured in
practice during the week.

pected to be fine for this
weekend’s action.

However, head coach Jim
Stagnitta chose to go to a fully
healthy Kronthal for the tough-
est defensive task. The senior
responded and was named
W&L’s Athlete of the Week for
his performance.

Kronthal had waited quite a
while for this opportunity. After
missing the entire ‘93 season fol-
lowing reconstructive knee sur-
gery, he spent most of last season
backing-up at long-stick
midﬁeld.

While doing so, Kronthal
earned the team’s T.W. Martin
Award for “spirit, desire, and
dedication.”

On the offensive side, limited
as it was, the Generals were aided
by junior] ason Hurst’s two goals.
JuniorsAndeJenkinsand Russell
Croft had a goal and one assist

each.

Jenkins, last year’s team goals
leader with 28, again tops all
Generals with ﬁve goals for the
season.

Saturday’s W&LToumament '

game will be the Generals’ home
opener.

Although their home record
was just 5-4 last season, the team
was 5-2 at Wilson Field. The
losses to Hampden-Sydney and
Gettysburg took place at Glen
Maury Park and Rockbridge
County High School, respec-
tively.

One of W&L’s ‘94 Wilson
Field defeats was to then sev-
enth—ranked Alfred in the cham-
pionship of the ﬁrst Washington
& Lee Tournament.

This year’s final between
Saturday ’s winners will be at 3 :00
Sunday, with the consolation
game slated for noon.

Holy Cross bounced Brown
from the game ‘following a three
run outburst, and continued on a
roll by adding two more runs in
the sixth, and in the seventh to
cruise to the victory.

“We thought we could hang
in there with them,” Stickley said,
“but we didn ’t score enough runs,
and left too many men on base.”

Rain washed out a scheduled
game between the Generals and
BridgewateratW&Lon Wednes-
day afternoon. The contest is re-
scheduled for Monday, March
20, at 3 PM.

The Generals do not receive
much of a scheduling break this
weekend following their exhaust-
ing stretch. W&L travels to
highly-rated Randolph-Macon
this Saturday to play a double-
header.

“The games will be very
close,” predicted Stickley.
“We’re looking forward to play-
ing them.”

Tennis
s t i 1 1
looking
for Win

By JOSHUA HESLINGA
Phi Staff Writer

The men’s tennis team be-
gan this season looking to re-
build following last year’s ﬁn-
ish at 16th in the nation. While
the Generals are still one of the
favorites to win the ODAC
crown, this year will prove a
tougher test for head coach Gary
Franke.

Besides losing several mem-
bers of last year’s team to gradu-
ation and study abroad, the team
faces a change in NCAA match
scoring that promises to affect

the focus of tennis
programsnationwide. .
Traditionally, the NCAA has

played six singles and three
doubles matches, with each
match counting one point in a
best of nine.

In an effort to shorten lengthy
matches, the NCAA changed
the rules this year, placing
greater emphasis on singles.
Teams now play three doubles
matches, which consist of one
pro-set (a set to eight games)
and count for a total of only one
point, going to whichever team
wins two of the three doubles
matches. Then teams play the
six singles, which still are worth
one point apiece. However, the
ODAC is continuing to adhere
to the older scoring method.

“Basically, it shortens the
matches, and that was the intent
of it,” commented Franke. “The
disadvantage is that kids aren’t
spending as much time on
doubles because doubles is less
important [under the new
rules].”

The Generals singles lineup
consists of Chris MacNaughton
at 1st, succeeding his All-
American brother Robby. He
will be followed by juniors Ryan

Adav at 2nd and Jesse Tavlor at
3rd, freshman Glenn Miller at

4th, sophomore Damian Brady
at 5th, and junior Clay Richards
at 6th.

In doubles, MacNaughton
and Taylor form the 1st doubles
tandem, followed by Aday and
Miller at 2nd, and Brady and
Richards at 3rd.

Last Wednesday, the Gen-
erals dropped a 5-2 decision to
theAverettCougarsin Danville.
Richards recorded W&L’s only
singles win at 6th singles, where
he crushed Tommy Nance, 6-1,
6-2. He also joined with Brady
at 3rd doubles to beat Olli
Rounaja and Dan Veasey, 8-6.

The Generals won the
doubles point as the 1st doubles
team of MacNaughton and Tay-
lor knocked off Pertti Viskari
and Petteri Lehtinen, 8-6.

The Generals stand at 0-2
after the loss to Averett and will
play Wooster tomorrow at
home, followed by Ripon on
Tuesday and Kenyon on Fri-
day. Coach Franke cited a need
to keep “trying to build confi-
dence in our shots” as the sea-
son gets underway in earnest.

discipline and government of the students and all student
organizations. The faculty may adopt such rules and regulation
as may be necessary for the discharge of its obligation.”

Ray said given the bylaws, the faculty must address this
issue. This is not the ﬁrst time Winter Rush has been an issue.
A few years ago, the faculty and the fraternities agreed to keep
Fall Rush with some provisions. During Fraternity Renais-
sance, the steering committee not only spent money to renovate
the houses but also drew up a set of standards for student
behavior, he said. Ray, who was on the committee, said the
faculty thinks the fraternities have failed to live up to those
standards.

“The faculty would not be addressing this if the fraternities
were living up to the bylaws of the IFC, “ he said.

Phi Kappa Sigma junior Mason New said faculty will
probably not change their minds about Winter Rush. He said it
will get faculty talking to students and getting their opinions.

‘‘I don’t think many students understand the faculty’s rea-
sons for having Winter Rush,” he said. “They think the faculty
is not really listening to their position at all.”

Pi Kappa Phi senior Whitney Bludworth agreed. He said
most faculty members know that fraternities support Fall Rush,
but they may not know all the reasons.

Although the faculty won’t vote formally on Winter Rush
until May, IFC are preparing for the worst. Batteh said IFC will
begin to discuss a Winter Rush plan that would work for the
fraternities.

favorably in the employment category, with 91 percent of its

“The real measures of a law school are the quality of its
faculty and students, the rigor of the learning that goes on, and
the professional competence and integrity of its graduates,”
said Barry Sullivan, dean of the W&L law school. “If you know
our faculty, students, and graduates, you know the kind of job
we are doing at W&L. lt’s reassuring when others recognize

The liun ed

     
 

By KIRK SUSONG
Phi Movie Reviewer

  

The Hunted — 1/2
I Occasionally one comes upon a genuinely
bad ﬁlm. I have found one in The Hunted.

The story is standard. Paul Racine (Christo-

: pher Lambert), an American businessman, gets
caught in the centuries-old feuding of two Japa-

.nese warrior cults, the ninja Makato, led by
Kinjo (John bone), and the samurai, led by
Takeda (Yoshio Harada). Basically this in-
volves a lot of swordplay, bloodshed and an-
cient Japanese castles.

If you go see an action ﬁlm, you’d be willing
to forgo character development or exciting cin-
ematography in favor of pure action — exhila-
rating, forceful and heart-pounding. This ﬁlm
provides none of that.

The action scenes are poorly, quickly shot,

as if in ‘Confuso-Vision.’ This is probably for
the better, though, since the actor’s choreogra-
phy is also dreadful. Some of the swordplay
looks interesting, but it becomes so highly
ritualized, formalized and brushed-over it ends
up resembling a mating dance more than pulse-
quickening ﬁghting-to-the-death.
A The treatment of the ﬁghts is so standard I
{often found myself — quite literally — yawning
through the most important action scenes. In-
stead of focusing on the athletic grace and
strength necessary of the actors (as in a good
Van Damme ﬁlm), we get blurry shots of fast-
moving pant legs, a quick ﬂash of steel and long
close-ups on the actor’s face.

This might work if the acting were decent,
but it fails terribly. Christopher Lambert made
his ﬁrst big splash as Tarzan in Greystoke. He
seems to have used the same approach in this
film — as a strong, silent misunderstood man
given to sudden outbursts. Unfortunately, his
character in this ﬁlm is supposed to be a suc-
cessful, articulate, urbane New York business-
man.

Despite their credentials, the rest of the cast
fails similarly. Work must be getting scarce for
the high-brow John Lone (M. Butterﬂy, The
Last Emperor), but after this disappointing per-
formance he shouldn’t expect any more calls
soon. Joan Chen (the mill owner in ‘Twin
Peaks’) has a rather minor role, but even that is
flubbed. Yoko Shimada was Richard
Chamberlain’s love interest inShogun and here
plays the exact same character, only three-
hundred years later in modem Japan.

Despite the dismal acting, I wonder how
much we should blame the actors. Rather, let’s
blame the script, because it is as predictable,
empty and trite as any l’ve ever seen. The
screenwriter is J.F. Lawton, who also doubles
as director. Lawton is better known for his work
as writer on Pretty Woman and Under Siege.
Considering the (relative) quality of those ﬁlms,
one wonders what happened to make this one so
very bad. Maybe he’s got some sort of distract-
ing ‘personal problems.’

He wasn’t able to redeem his script through
his direction, either. Now and then, Lawton
tries to do something daring with the camera,
but it ends up looking only silly and preten-
tious. There are several dream sequences which
are incredibly absurd - mostly slow shots of
swirling colors and mystical, confused faces.

Overall, the ﬁlm’s tone is very reminiscent
of Highlander — full of swords, costumes, an-
cient feuds, and Christopher Lambert. But this

ﬁlm is not even close to the level of Highlander ’

(or even Highlander 2.‘ The Quickening). If
you’re looking for a good sword ﬁght, rent
C yranodeBergerac. Avoid this ﬁlm at all costs.

Rating Scale

ﬁﬁﬁﬁr - Go buy this as soon as it comes out on
video. It is an instant classic. “You’ll laugh; you’ll
cry; and maybe, just maybe, you’ll learn something
about yourself.”

ﬂﬁﬁr -Go seethis ﬁlm now, while it’s still on the big
screen. It’s worth a few Oscar nominations and the
seven bucks you’ll pay if you see it outside Lexing-
ton. Overall, “Better than Cats!”

ﬁt} - Okay, so there have been better films. Never-
theless, it is a good example of its genre, and you
should probably see it on videotape. Still, probably
“Better than Cats!”

it - It happens to be on HBO, and you’re blowing off
tomorrow's reading. Although yourtime would prob-
ably be better served on your education, its free and
you’re bored, so go ahead and watch it.

Q} - Even if its free and your best friend said he
never laughed harder, trust me, this one sucks.
Don’t waste your time, or at least don’t waste it on
this. (There’s always MTV.)

/A\an  Keyes

By MICHAEL
HEwLE'1'r
Phi Staff Writer

 

Alan L. Keyes is becoming a fa-
miliar face in politics today. The
former Reagan appointee to the State
Department has become renowned
for his powerful speeches.

I saw him at the law school a
couple of days before Lani Guinier
spoke. Although I disagreed with his
politics, I was impressed by his intel-
ligence and his ability to articulate
his ideas with clarity. That’s why I
decided to pick up his book, Masters
of the Dream.‘ The Strength and Be-
trayalofBlackAmerica. In this book,
Keyes attempts to posit a different
view of black American history that
can adapt to his political conserva-
tism.

He argues quite persuasively that
blacks survived slavery primarily
because of their conception of Chris-
tianity.

Christianity gave blacks a sense
of their humanity and self-worth.
Although they were oppressed, Chris-
tianity allowed blacks to have faith
and work hard. With Christian moral
values, African-Americans kept their
families together and resisted the de-
humanization inherent in institution
of slavery.

However, black Americans are
oftentimes ashamed of their enslaved
ancestors, ashamed of the fact that
they are descended from slaves.

“Somewhere, therefore, in the con-
sciousness of every African-Ameri-
can there is a subtle temptation to
disown our captive ancestors, and to
think that our past is not a triumph to
be celebrated, but a shame that we
must overcome...So we look to Af-
rica, glossin g over the fact that Africa
is not home to a single, united people
but a polyglot of diversity of tribes
and nations.”

Of course, some blacks are
ashamed of their enslaved ancestry
but not all. Certainly, there are blacks
who are either ignorant or choose to
forget the struggles of their slave
ancestors but again not all blacks.

He further argues that this system
of moral values sustained blacks
through Reconstruction to the early
20th century and provided the foun-

Irish!"

Or worse yet, having some zealous party-
goer spew green puke on your shoes. We aren’t
even going to get in to the elfjokes.

So, you’ve had it, and you’re looking for an
alternative. Well, Student Activities Coordina-
tor Michelle Richardson has you in mind.

If you have seen those signs around
campus with the suggestive picture
of a man and a woman with the

tainment troupe rented from Roanoke, they
are actually a musical group scheduled
to play the GHQ Friday night.
This concert is the latest event
planned by Dean of Fun
Michelle in her attempt to pro-
vide alternative social options
for students.
The Nudes is a male-fe-
male duo from New York who
describes their music as having

He played music throughout his college
years.

Stephanie Winters is Park’s female coun-
terpart.

She is the group’s cellist and vocalist.

The two paired after Winters read an ad

ing a cellist.

dation of the Civil Rights Movement.
Black leaders such as Martin Luther
King were molded in the black church.
However, black people didn’t need to
be reminded of their human worth,
they already knew it. What King did
was simply to articulate something
that black people knew throughout
their history, he says.

Throughout the book, he criticizes
those historians and social scientists
who have misread or ignored the cen-
trality of Christianity or religious val-
ues in black-Ameri-
can history.

He takes Daniel
Patrick Moynihan to
particular task for his
notion that black cul-
ture itself was the
blame for rising lev-
els of illegitimacy in
the black community.
He also analyzes so-
cial-scientists such as
Nicholas Lemann, au-
thor of The Promised
Land, and Charles
Murray, author of
Losing Ground and
The Bell Curve.

In his view, the
problem with social
science lies in its in-
ﬂexible reliance on
facts. He contends that
social science fails to
seethe strengthsofthe
black community and
instead simply spews
out statistic after sta-
tistic.

In fact, Keyes lays
the problems of the
black community at
the feet of social sci-
entists and politicians
who have created a
“liberal welfare-state”
where blacks are essentially seen as
helpless victims, a view that is in
opposition to black history itself.

The black liberal establishment,
as he sees it, has distanced itself from
the black community and has assisted
in the destructive policies of the liber-
als.

Politicians such as Jesse Jackson
and Marion Barry have “sold out” the
black community and have replaced
black peoples’ interests with their
interests.

This has resulted in the sheer de-
struction of those values that have

banner headline that reads “The
Nudes,” don’t get your hopes up too I

While it may sound like “The ’
Nudes” is the name of an adult enter-

 

sustained the black community dur-
ing slavery and Jim Crow segrega-
tion, he says, Strangely enough, he
also criticizes the Brown v. Board of
Education decision.

“However, the opinion incorpo-
rated the argument that without inte-
gration, there could be no equality.

It seemed unthinkable that an edu-
cational institution that had little or
no white participation was not inher-
ently inferior.

Pity the poor African countries,

where there aren’t enough whites to
go around.

The outcome of the Brown case
was the right outcome, but the ratio-
nale for the decision unintentionally
bespoke the very prejudice whose
effects it sought to overturn.”

I think Keyes misses the whole
point ofthe Brown decision. The de-
cision overturned Plessy v. Ferguson,
which said separate but equal was
equal. Thurgood Marshall proved that
contention wrong, and the Supreme
Court agreed with him.

As I read the book. I became in-

“infectious grooves, engaging
melodies, and compelling lyrics.”
Walter Parks is the group’s
vocalist, guitarist, and songwriter.
Parks was a business major while

creasingly perturbed that he sees any
positive good in racial segregation.
Although Keyes admits that segrega-
tion was wrong, he nonetheless ar-
gues that segregation strengthened
black cultural and moral institutions.
Keyes forgets that segregation also
excluded blacks from participating
in mainstream America. He does cor-
rectly note the sacriﬁces.that work-
ing-class blacks made in order to
provide opportunities, however lim-
ited, to their children. Black women
scrubbed and cleaned
white peoples’ houses
while keeping their
families together.
Yet, Keyes sug-
gests blacks were sat-
isﬁed with their posi-
tion in society. The
black elites, not the
black working class,
faced the most viru-
lent racism because
they sought accep-
tance into the white
mainstream.

“Working—class
blacks could be both
economically and psy-
chologically self-suf-
ficient.

They could grow
their own crops, ply
their trade, or offer
their services to white
businesses and house-
holds without appear-
ingtoassimilatewhite
cultural values, or as-
piring to more exten-
sive integration with
theirwhiteclients and
employers.”

He further argues
that although work-
ing—class blacks
seemed submissiveto
racism, they actually resisted the de-
humanizationinherentin segregation.
Black elites by seeking greater eco-
nomic advancement had assimilated
white values and denied their black
heritage. ' V

Hr, dismisses blacks such as Paul
Rol'eson who pursued a career on the
stage while protesting American rac-
ism.

Instead, he compares Robeson to
Thurgood Marshall, who became a
lawyer, saying that “Marshall saw
achievement in terms of his obliga-
tion to himselfand the black commu-

review of their self-released debut album.
“The Nudes” will begin playing at 9:00
p.m. inn the GHQ.
For a refreshing alternative to the typical St.
Patty Day’s concert, be sure to be there.

writes with inte igence hut eaves readers rustrateci

nity.” Fine. Robeson, on the other
hand, decided that law was not his
road to achievement; he sought
achievement in the arts. Yet, Keyes
criticizes him, accusing him ofbeing
more concerned with white opinion
than with black needs.

In my view, Robeson never forgot
where he came from and attempted to
bring dignity to the black culture by
achieving in the arts. Keyes is wrong:
Robeson never forgot his obligation
to the black community.

More importantly, blacks want-
ing to break barriers in the arts, law,
journalism and medicine had little to
do with trying to appease white
people. These blacks simply wanted
to participate in the American Dream:
the idea that if you work hard, you
will succeed. Keyes is right in point-
ing out that the American Dream was
about more than making money, but
succeeding and participating in the
mainstream is the ideal on which this
country was built.

After World War II, black so]-
diers became more militant because
they saw the irony of ﬁghting fas-
cism in Germany and beingtreated as
second—class citizens in America.

They were angry because they
wanted something better in life, and
Jim Crow kept them from getting" it.
But Keyes thinks black people were
better off in racially segregated ar-
eas, cut off from opportunities avail-
able to other American citizens.

Throughout the book, Keyes ex-
presses his longing for a simplertime
when blacks had nice little institu-
tions that sustained them through sla-
very and segregation. While he criti-
cizes the welfare system and bureau-
cracy, he thinks blacks were and are
better off if they are sectioned away
from the American mainstream.

Although he talks about neigh-
borhood councils and more power to
the people, his ideas leave blacks
virtually cut off from the opportuni-
ties enjoyed by other Americans.

He stretches his conception of
the black Christian tradition to ri-
diculous proportions, and he eventu-
ally loses steam when he champions
Clarence Thomas and lambastes Jesse
Jackson. Keyes contradicts himself
too often in this book, even when he
occasionally makes some valid
points.

In the end, Keyes writes grandi-
ose rhetoric, and he leaves the reader
unsatisfied and frustrated.

innocence aside, no one can say he was not torn apart to witness
this tragedy.
The Honor System is so deeply imbedded in all of us. It is the

‘V law that governs us and the motivation which guarantees that we

live honorably. To see a fellow student fall from grace disturbs
us because we realize that our system is not perfect. To see a

,3 proceeding conducted in the name of justice and then turned into

a public spectacle disturbs us even more.

Let’s put this behind us. But let us never forget. Always
remember the coldness and emptiness you felt in your stomach
when the verdict was rendered. Please let this serve as a lesson
to all of us. A

The convergence theory says bad always accompanies good.

“l When we are most happy, we are most upset. We do not pretend

to understand this. In fact, it confuses the hell out of us. But
maybe when we accept that fact, things get a little easier.

Coffee: The possibilities are endless

GREEN LAND
Betsy Green

This column was inevitable.

Take a deep breath. It’s time for
another column in the series I like to
call“StufflThinkIsCool.”Thisweek’s
topic: Coffee.

I love coffee. I don’t just mean that
in the sense people mean when they
say they love their country or their
parents. I mean, I really love coffee. I
have an ever-growing collection of
coffee cups and a really cool penguin-
shaped carafe. I have two coffee makers,
my own bean grinder, and a cappucino/
espresso maker. I am deeply serious
about coffee.

My obsession with coffee has been
rapidly fed by the Gevalia Coffee
Company. They sent me mail (which
won them points with me right away)
offering to give me a four cup coffee
maker (with the cone-shaped ﬁlters
recommended by my friends on
rec.food.drink.coffee) and a pound of
beans for a mere five dollars. I sent
them a check right away. lt’s excellent
coffee. Unlike fellow Gevalia member
Richard Weaver, I bothered to read the
whole thing and learned that they would
periodically be sending me coffee. Also
unlike Richard Weaver, I considered
this a good thing. The only problem is
that the amount of coffee I now have is
slightly overwhelming, even for me. In
my room right now, I have about five
pounds of unground beans. The time
has come for some experimentation.

The first thing I wanted to try with
my coffee was to see what would
happen if instead of giving my plants
water, I gave them coffee. The results
have been inconclusive so far, but I
have two theories as to how
Experimental Plant Raul will react.
Theory One is that Raul will respond to
the caffeine in his new diet by growing
really huge and eventually overtaking

especially if he decides to sing to me.
Theory Two is that coffee will have a
Magic Beans effect on Raul. He will
grow into a huge beanstalk, similar to
the one in the fairy tale with which we
are all familiar. The difference, though,
is that having a beanstalk. giant, and so
forth, will probably prove a lot less
useful to me than it did to Jack. I can’t
steal golden eggs
from the giant; it’s
an Honor
Violation. Instead,
I will occasionally
have dinner with
the giant and take

and I’d fall asleep. Only one time in my
recent life has any form of coffee been
able to keep me awake. Picture it:
Cordova, Spain, 1992. My brother (The
Boy) and I have just spent a sleepless
night on a train. At breakfast, we are
offered the delectable beverage that is
known as cafe
con leche (that
means coffee
with milk, kids).

so much that the
fact that every
thermal mug I own
smells like coffee
and taints the ﬂavor of any non-coffee
beverage I put in them doesn’t bother
me in the least. In fact, I kind of like it.
If you feel the same way I do, try this
craft tip that is probably worthy of
mention onLive With Regis and Kathy
Lee. Grind some coffee beans and put
them in the foot of a pair of knee-high
pantyhose to make a lovely sachet. It
works much better at making my clothes
smell like coffee than my previous
methodofaccidentally spillingfullcups
on myself.

We all know that drinking a lot of
alcohol will build your tolerance——it
will eventually take a lot more to have
an effect on you. The same has been
true for me with coffee.

I once filled my 36 ounce coffee
cup/silo with espresso and took it to the
class of a certain professorwhose name
I will wisely not mention here. I then
had contests called Certain Professor

con leche sin
leche (handy
translation:
coffee with
milk without milk).

Damn, it was good. It was an
experience that I have heretofore been
unable to duplicate. That coffee was so
strong that it was actually thick. This is
a coffee so powerful that you don’t
even need a cup to hold it, so mighty
that it allowed me to see the very face
of God, so tough that it might keep you
from snoring in Professor Whose Name
I Will Wisely Not Mention Here’sclass.
The Boy and I saw marketing poten-
tial. We shall call it Coffee-On-A-Stick
and sell it as such. Our slogan will be,
“Coffee-On-A-Stick: Quit messing
around and eat your coffee.” I know it
will make us rich. How could consum-
ers reject a product with the words
“On-A-Stick” in its name?

Coffee-On-A-Stick inspired me to
try another experiment. Think of those
Spring and Summer days when you
really want a cup of coffee but don’t

Goshen. What should you do? The
answer to this dilemma came to me
almost as in a dream and I tried it right
away. I took a plastic Solo cup, filled it
with coffee, and stuck a butter knife in
it. I then opened the freezer, ducked the
avalanche of boxes of frozen spinach,
and placed the cup inside. Twelve hours
later, my creation was complete:
Coffeesicle. I cut away the plastic cup
and had a huge Solo cup-shaped frozen
chunk of coffee. Mmmm! It‘
was exquisite.

The next time I go to Wal-Mart, I’m
going to buy some popsicle molds like
I had when I was little so the coffee
hunks will be more manageable. I can’t
wait to go to class Spring Term gnaw-
ing on a big chunk of coffeesicle. Re-
member how popsicles used to turn
your tongue purple or whatever? The
coffeesicle turned my tongue brown,
which was not an altogether
unpleasant experiment.

Ah, coffee. The possibilities are
endless. I’ve been thinking I should try
to incorporate it into cooking, using
coffee where the recipe calls for water,
such as in cake mixes and Kraft
Macaroni and Cheese. I’m sure my
cookbook Stuff You Can Do With
Coffee will be stiff competition for
Sarah Gilbert’s Cooking WithA lcohol.
Sarah’s book doesn’t have a prayer if I
include some of my coffee/alcohol
ideas. Irish coffee is great and
everything, but why not try something
stronger? I’ve been wondering what
would happen if instead of putting water
in my espresso maker, I used rum. I
have always thought drinking espresso
should be like doing shots anyway, so
why not? An even better idea: what
wouldhappenifinsteadofputtingwater
in my coffee maker I used gin?
Unfortunately, I’m fresh out of gin,
having had polished off the last of it
when I put it in my cereal this morning.

Still, I know it’s worth trying,
especially since I have five pounds of
beans to use up while they’re still at
their peak.

On February 27, 1995, the Stu-
dent-Faculty Hearing Board heard
and deliberated a case of sexual mis-
conduct . The committee found a
Washington and Lee student guilty
of sexual misconduct. The verdict
reads as follows: “Guilty of
misconduct by sexual exploitation,
through manipulative and
predatory behavior.”

The following sanction was im-
posed: “Social probation for the rest
of the 1994-95 academic year, pro-
bation from presence in the fresh-
man dorms for the rest of the aca-
demic year, mandatory counseling
for a period to be determined by

Winter rush debate disregards students’ interests

MY VIEW
Phil Carrott, ’96

The topic of a winter or deferred fraternity
rush has been a hot topic for some time at IFC
meetings and among some professors for more
months than most students know. The argu-
ments stem, as I understand them, from a five-
year plan made in 1989 that has obviously come
to term, the report made by the Co-education
Review Committee, and the desires of various
deans, including the Dean of Freshmen. These
documents, in combination with a report pre-
pared by the University of the South describing
universities similar to W&Lthat have moved to
a winter rush from a fall rush, have prompted
some professors, for whatever reason, to rec-
ommend exercising the trump card the faculty
holds over the students and move, forcibly,
fraternity rush to the winter.

There are markedly different “camps” among
the faculty in the reasoning for the move as I
have seen. One portion does not feel the de-
ferred pledgeship implemented in 1987 has
worked,and the students (the IFC) not enforc-
ing the plan effectively enough in years past.
This is the viewpoint the IFC is currently trying
to remedy with its fall pledgeship plan. Another
portion of the faculty (and the Dean of Fresh-
men) think the freshmen not only need more
time to make a social decision such as joining a
fraternity, but need a term free of commitments
such as rush to “get their feet on the ground”

academically. They believe fall term would
serve this purpose. In addition, there is the
camp from which Dr. H. Thomas Williams (the
professor who made the motion for deferring
rush at the last faculty meeting) comes, that
believes it is time to at least try winter rush for
reasons such as those enumerated in the Co-
education Review Committee’s report, the
Sewanee report, and the five year plan. They
believe the reasons for winter rush and the
“success” it has had at universities of similar
size are too overwhelming to ignore. Then there
are those three-plus professors who, for what-
ever reason (God bless them), voted with the
IFC and students. I would like to address these
different views and hopefully can make some
faculty think harder (if it is possible) about the
issue at hand.

The IFC held two meetings in the past two
months at which faculty, in some capacity,
were present and engaged in debate of the issue.
Although some student opinions were a bit
rough and perhaps fell on deaf ears from the
start, progress was made in my opinion (espe-
cially with the SAC, who is currently endorsing
the fall pledgeship plan set forth by the IFC).
The vote by the faculty, however, did not con-
firm this. Either our arguments did fall on deaf
ears or we students obviously do not know what
is in our best interest. I would argue (principally
to the first group from above) that despite the
arguments such as “we’d have to have parties
all the time and we’d run out of money,” or
“everyone would cheat and dirty rush,” or “the
freshmen would go out all the time, forgetting
their classes,” which are against winter rush;

arguments for a fall rush are more compelling.

First, it is an activity in which the vast
majority of freshmen get to know the vast
majority of the upperclass in a setting where
they are more likely to actually get to know the
upperclassmen in addition to their fellow class-
mates. (This does not apply to males exclu-
sively, freshman women are an integral part of
the rush party, as are their upperclass counter-
parts.) Rush is also better in the fall because it
has a definite end, where winter rush would
more or less require very
simple rules or no rules and

freshmen to drink beer at their house. After
rush, however, most houses are concerned with
initiating all of their pledges on time and do
want their freshmen to study, go to class, etc.
Besides, what better environment to get your
feet on the ground than in one in which numer-
ous students not only already have their feet on
the ground, but probably represent a variety of
disciplines? I think this might have been the
reasoningbehind the deferred pledgeship(which
has worked better in the past two years than in
years past that I know
of). For example, the
freshman midterm

could go on for five or six
weeks before both fresh-
men and upperclassmen tire
of the whole thing and turn
to their studies. This brings
up another argument that
freshmen should be ex-

social activities second in and want their Winter rush, though,
an attempt to quiet the '°' if it is not a solution,
“work hard - play hard” freshlnento study, go should notbe an experi-

maxim of W&L. Frankly,
the freshmen will find out
sooner or later who will buy
them beer and who will not.

To Dean Manning and Dean Ruscio, it is
true that freshmen need a tenn to acclimate
themselves to their new environment, time to
learn how to study and to learn what will take up
their time orwhat tests need a lot of preparation.
I do not know of any fraternity that cares
whether a freshman is doing his work or drink-
ing beerduring rush, they just want to find some

ment either. I went to the
source and spoke with
Dr. Williams about win-
ter rush and his feeling
and the feelings around the faculty; I must say
his arguments were very informative and well-
reasoned. But I think too much of what Dr.
Williams and the faculty are putting forward
does not have enough student experience or
recent student experience behind it. The C0-
education Review Committee report had only
two student members as authors, and only opin-

To the editor:

ions from about four students, maybe less (I am
happy to say I was one of those four); this is a
little biased (especially with an 824 femalezmale
ratio for the committee itself). I would tend not
to accept the report no matter how objective its
authors were, just because the first-hand knowl-
edge or opinions of student life were not ex-
pressed in a quantity usually accepted by the
scientific community. I think the five-year plan
would come under similar fire, although I have
not read it. The Sewanee report cannot be
denied as a comprehensive study, but it can be
denied on the count that NONE of the schools
with winter rush systems are like W&L in
respects such as tradition, Greek system,
or atmosphere.

We are unique among liberal arts colleges in
our tradition and student freedom in learning in
various extra-curricular settings. The students,
as they did yesterday at the open honor trial,
have traditionally made the decisions concern-
ing their life.

I think there is a definite situation such as
with the Student-Faculty Hearing Board or
Student Affairs Committee, where we do not
always know what is best, but rush is not one of
those situations, especially when the IFC is
making progress in actually enforcing the rules
set down when we were in junior high school.

In order to change the student life, you must
first start with changing the students. If you
want winter rush, you’re going to have to pass
it by us in spirit no matter what. Please do what
is best for all aspects of Washington and Lee -
freshman and upperclassman, academic
and social.

LETTER

On behalf of the Student Affairs Committee, I am pleased to announce that the co-recipients
of the 1995 Edward L. Pinney Prize are Kelly Leigh Brotzman and Jonathan Jeremy Van Dyke.
This prize was established by the Washington and Lee faculty in memory of Edward Lee
Pinney, professor of politics, who died in 1980. It is awarded to the undergraduate student who
“demonstrates extraordinary committment both to personal scholarship and to the nurturing of

intellectual life at Washington and Lee.”
Congratualations to Kelly and Jonathan.

Baseball returns with Victory  

By Scorr BOOKWALTER
Phi Assistant Sports Editor

The Washington and Lee
baseball squad continued the ef-
fort to climb out of its offensive
funk last week, as the Generals
won one of three league games to
set their record at 3-8 overall,
and 1-2 in the ODAC.

The Generals traveled to
Ashland, Virginia, on Saturday
to square off in a doubleheader
with Randolph-Macon, but the
Yellow Jackets treated their
guests rudely by sweeping the
twinbill, 7-0, and 8-2.

However, W&L returned to
the victory column on Tuesday
by knocking off Eastern Menno-
nite at home by a count of 4-2,.
The Generals tied Hamden-
Sydney, 9-9, on Thursday after-
noon.

Unfortunately for the Gener-
als, they collided with a red-hot
pitcher in the first game on Satur-
day.

Randolph-Macon’s Jimmy
Mathews confounded the W&L
offense by not allowing a single
baserunner until the sixth inning.
By the time the Generals were
finally able to reach base, the
contest was no longer in doubt as
Mathews and the Yellow Jackets
cruised, 7-0.

W&L ﬁnished with a scant
two hits on the game to go along
with its shaky defensive play.
One bright spot for the Generals
was the pitching performance of
senior Bates Brown, who entered
in relief in the fourth inning.
Brown was quickly taken down-
town by the Yellow Jackets, al-
lowing a home run to the first
batter he faced, but the senior
found a groove as he retired the
ﬁnal eight R-MC hitters.

The second game began with
promise forthe Generals, but ﬁn-
ished similarly to the opener.
Junior Matt Errnigiotti smacked
a triple and trotted home follow-

ing the first of two hits on the
game -by senior Todd Stanton, to
hand the Generals a short-lived
1-0 advantage. However, the
Yellow Jackets didn’t waste
much time in reversing the mo-
mentum.

‘R-MC served up a four-run
inning in the third to grab a 4-1
lead, and never broke stride the
rest ofthe way, ﬁnishing with an
8-2 victory and a doubleheader
sweep.

“We didn’t play very good,”
Head coach Jeff Stickley com-
mented about the doubleheader.
“Our pitching was pretty good,
but we didn’t swing the bats real
well.”

Washington and Dec returned
to the comfortable conﬁnes of
Smith Field and 75-degree tem-
peratures on Tuesday afternoon
as Eastern Mennonite journeyed
down from Harrisonburg to op-
pose the Generals and Bates
Brown.

Brown, the star relief pitcher
in the first game of the Randolph-
Macon doubleheader, was given
the starting nod by Stickley in the
hope of erasing the memory of
the doubleheader sweep and start-
ing off the Generals’ four-game
homestand in successful fashion.
He did not let Stickley down, as
the senior pitcher settled in after
early control problems and
mowed down Eastern Menno-
nite into the eighth inning, yield-
ing only two runs on the day.

“Bates battled hard, since he
didn’t have his breaking stuff,”
Stickley mentioned. “He got into
trouble early, but he worked out
of it.”

As much of a presence as
Brown provided on the mound,
he equally frightened Eastern
Mennonite at the plate. Brown
blasted three hits, including a pair
of doubles, in four chances at bat.

Ermigiotti replaced the tiring
Brown in the eighth inning, but
he did not provide an improved

out Eastern for the final two in-
nings to notch his ﬁrst save of the
season in the Generals;’ 4-2 tri-
umph. ,

Equally sweet in the skid-
breakingwinwasthe factthatther
Generals’ defense did not com-
mit an error. '

W&L faced Hampden-
Sydney on Thursday at home,
and finished in a wild 9-9 dead--.,.
lock.

Rob Boston entered inrelief
in the top of the seond and pitched
out of a bases-loaded jam by in-
ducing a H-S ﬂyout and double
play. ”

Boston remained on the
mound for the next nine innings
before the game was called on
acoount of darkness in the tenth
inning. Starting pitcher Mark.’-
Hazelwood went the distance for
Hampden-Sydney.

Brown continued his hot hit-
ting by turning in a 2 for 6 effort,
including three RBl’s. Junior

Preston Miller went 3 for 4 for“

the Generals.

The remaining two games on
the homestand assume an even
more important signiﬁcance for
W&L, since it embarks on a
stretch of six of the next eight
games on the road, which begins
this Wednesday at Lynchburg
College.

“The home-ﬁeld advantage is
a big deal in our conference,”
remarked Stickley. “I feel that
it’s worth at least a run in every
game.”

The Generals remain at Smith

Field for a doubleheader on Sat- ,-

urday with Virginia Wesleyan,
which is perennially one of the
top teams in the ODAC.
Stickley expresses conﬁdence
over the upcoming contests.

“We’re looking forward to '

winning a couple games at
home,” he stated. “We’ve
struggled offensively lately, but
we’ll break out of it soon. We’re

opportunity for the Eastern Men- heading in the right direction.” ‘V

Men top Wooster

By RYAN BREMER
Phi Staff Writer

Washington and Lee’s men’s tennis team needed a big victory
after losing two matches to start the season.

It was unlikely to think that the Generals would record their first
match victory against a team that came into the match ranked 13th
nationally in Division III. But that is exactly what happened as the
team knocked off Wooster last Saturday at home, 5-2.

The key to W&L’s victory was the fact that they swept all of the
doubles matches. ln number one doubles, the tandem of Chris
MacNaughton and Jesse Taylor put away the favored Wooster pair of
Warren Cham-a-koon and Joe J enckes, 8-5. This crucial win set the
tone for the rest of the match.

The number two duo of Damian Brady and Clay Richards won
easily, 8-1. W&L’s number three tandem, Glenn Miller and Ryan
Aday won in similar fashion, 8-2.

The team carried the momentum of the doubles victories into the
singles matches. Taylor, Aday, Miller, and Brady all chalked up wins
as W&L sealed the match.

The Generals, now ranked 19th, return to the hard court this week,
‘expecting tough matches from two teams ranked in the top twenty-

1V6.

They defeated 21st ranked Ripon on Tuesday, they next challenge
23rd ranked Kenyon on Saturday.

Women fall 13-5

By Karm GRANT
Phi Staff Writer

After starting a perfect 3-0 on
the Liberty Hall Fields, the
women’s lacrosse team suffered
its first defeat Thursday.

The Generals fell by a 13-5
margin at Lynchburg. The Hor-
nets had knocked the Generals
out of last year’s Old Dominion
AthleticConferenceToumament
with a 12-6 win, but W&L could
not muster any revenge in its ﬁrst
road game of the ‘95 season.

Senior tri-captain Lindsay
Coleman would not be denied
her typical offensive output, net-
ting three goals to lead the scor-
ing against Lynchburg.

Senior tri -captain, and ODAC
playerof the week, Nicole Ripken
and freshman Whitney Parker
registered a goal each to round
out the scoring. Sophomore
goalie Brooke Glenn stopped
eleven shots during a busy day in
net.

Glenn, despite the loss, had an
outstanding week in goal for
W&L(3-1,2-1 ODAC).The lone
goalie on the Generals’ roster
earned the school’s Athlete of
the Week honor for her perfor-
mance in the ﬁrst two victories of
the season.

Following up on last week’s
15-2 season opening win over

Bridgewater, Glenn picked up
ten saves versus Division II Lock
Haven as the Generals came from
behind fora thrilling 10-9 win on
Saturday.

Trailing 9-7 late in the game,
W&L got goals from sophomore
Erika Snyderwith 6:02 left, from
Parker with 4:03 to go, and
Coleman netted the game winner
20 seconds later on a pass from
Ripken.

Glenn shut down the Bald
Eagles during the rally to ensure
the victory.

On Monday, the goaltender
was not needed quite as much as
Washington & Lee took a grid-
iron-like 20-0 lead to halftime.
Head coach Jan Hathom merci-
fully rested her starters for the
ﬁnal 30 minutes in route to the
24-5 ﬁnal score.

Even Glenn got a break as

senior defender Sarah
Aschenbach made her debut in
goal.

The 24 goal outburst tied
W&L’s single-game record. In
1993, Randolph-Macon
Women’s College was the vic-
tim of a 24-4 beating by the Gen-
erals.

Next up will be another road
ODAC affair. The team travels
south to Guilford in hopes of
picking up its third conference
win, then returns to the Liberty
Hall Fields on Wednesday to
meet Randolph-Macon.

Wednesday. The next match for the Generals is Saturday at Gettysburg.

Men’s lacrosse continues strong start .

By KEITH GRANT
Phi Staff Writer

Washington & Lee men’s la-
crosse is off to its best start in 15
years, and not a monent too soon.

The 5-0 Generals travel to
Gettysburg on Saturday to face
the second-ranked team in Divi-
sion III. ‘The Bullets (2-0) are
coming off of a 15-4 win against
fourth-ranked Denison, and re-
turn most of their players from
last season’s 12-2 squad.

“We match up well against
them,” said Generals’ head coach
Jim Stagnitta. “lt’s been a good
game the last two years.”

Gettysburg has won four
straight versus W&L going back
to the Generals’ 8-7 double-over-
time win in 1990.

In last year’s meeting, the then
fifth-ranked Bullets pulled away
with four straight second-half
goals for a 10-7 win under the
lights at Rockbridge County High
School.

Among Gettysburg’s key re-
turnees is senior defenseman
Brian McGurn and senior

attackman Tim Demore, whose
63 assists and 96 points in ‘94
were both school records. This
season, Demore has registered
eleven points (6 goals, 5 assists)
through two games.

W&L was ranked seventh by
the preseason USI LA poll, but is
in good position to move up with
a strong showing Saturday.

The Generals improved to 5-0
Wednesday with a 11-5 Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference win
against 17th-ranked Lynchburg.
Ahead of W&L, #5 Roanoke was
abused by top-rated and defend-
ing champion Salisbury_State in
a demoralizing 30-8 loss on the
Maroons’ home field.

Also, Denison was beaten by
#16 Franklin & Marshall, in ad-
dition to their loss to Gettysburg.

Wednesday, the Generals
upped their ODAC record to 3-0,
thanks to sophomore goalie Doug
Gubner’s 15 saves against the
Hornets (3-3, 0-1 ODAC).

W&L scored the first four
goals of the game and led 6-] late
in the first half. However,
Lynchburg’s Scott Nelson scored
with just 1 8seconds left and Chris
Esibill netted one ﬁve minutes

into the third quarter to cut the
margin to 6-3.

Junior Adam Butterworth
eased the Wislon Field crowd’s
fears with a goal just 50 seconds
later. Junior Russell Croft and
Esibill traded goals before senior
Andy Dutton scored with just 38
seconds left in the third to give
the Generals a comfortable 9-4
lead going into the ﬁnal 15 min-
utes.

Junior Ande Jenkins scored
twice early in the fourth and tin-
ished with a game-high three
goals and one assist. Jenkins leads
W&L with 22 points, including
16 goals.

Croft, Butterworth, Dutton,
and senior Scott Mackley netted
two goals apiece for the Gener-
als.

W&L has now outscored its
opponents 73-30 through five
games, yet has often gotten off to
a slow start before pulling away
late. Stagnitta hopes to see more
consistent play from his experi-
enced offense.

“We’re real happy about the
defense,” he said. “We would
just like to see some more consis-
tency on offense.”

Pht b etsy Gree, The Rirmllg-tttum Phi ,
The men’s lacrosse team improved to 5-0 on the season with a victory over 17th ranked Lynchburg on’

Last weekend, Jenkins and
Mackley each posted back—to-
back four goal games as the Gen-
erals won the second-annual

W&L Tournament with ten goal ’‘

victories over Randolph-Macon
(20-10) and Trinity, CT (16-6).
Both of those teams are ranked in
the top-25 nationally, as are a

total of ten of W&L’s 14 oppo- V

nents.

The harsh schedule has so far
paid off as the team is off to its
best start ever at the Division III
level, a move they made in 1987.

The 1980 Generals began their
campaign 5-O before losing to
Virginia, 13-8.

They then posted another five
game winning streak in route to a

10-3 regular season. Their run 7

ended with a 12-4 NCAA Tour-
nament quarterfinal loss to Syra-
cuse in what would be W&L’s
last appearance in Division I post-
season play.

After facing Gettysburg, the

Generals get a full-week to pre-
pare for perenial rival Roanoke.
That match-up annually decides
the ODAC championship, and
this year W&L hasthe advantage
of hosting the game.

VOLUME 95, NO. 18

By ALEX CHRISTENSEN
Phi Staff Writer

“I’m glad to be here. I feel abit
like the Christians being introduced
to the lions.”

That is how Dean Kenneth
Ruscio, associate dean of the Com-
merce School, opened Tuesday
night’s discussion of winter Rush
in the GHQ. About 40 students
attended, including IFC President
Kevin Batteh, senior. Only four of
them were women. Some faculty
members and Dean of Students
David Howison were also in atten-
dance.

The event lasted from 7:30 un-
til 8:40 p.m., with Dean Ruscio
opening with a formal statement
followed by an informal question-
answer-comment period.

Ruscio’s opening statement
expressed his own personal “dis-
appointment with the way the de-

Gilbert makes farewell to
Universitg and Phi

bate has been framed so far.” The
discussion over winter Rush has
been a series of confrontational
moves from each side, the faculty
and supporters of maintaining fall
Rush, said Ruscio, without any
concrete communication between
the two.

However, Ruscio did try to put
forward an argument for winter
Rush, which he personally sup-
ports, while also addressing com-
mon concerns about its
possible effects.

Ruscio began with the proposi-
tions that fraternities are and will
continue to be central to the stu-
dent life of Washington and Lee
and that any form of Rush is “in-
herently undesirable” but unavoid-
able. With those two parameters
established, he proceeded to put
forward the arguments for winter
Rush and against fall Rush.

Fall Rush leaves freshmen
forced to rely solely upon con-
trived meetings with fraternity

members and whatever informa-
tion they can glean from them to
make an extremely important de-
cision, said Ruscio. He said that
while some argued that this was
actually a better way for fratemi-
ties to be presented, he felt that a
more balanced view might emerge
from three months more in which
fraternities and the way they func-
tion could be observed firsthand.
He said that while faculty views
are diverse, he personally would
favor a fairly open contact rule for
fall term under the winter
Rush plan.

He also expressed concerns that
class unity is hampered when stu-
dents are immediately divided up
into little groups and taught sepa-
rate traditions rather than having a
period to develop a sense of
group identity, responsibility
and camaraderie.

As for rebutting arguments
against winter Rush, Ruscio as-
serted that scenarios of increased

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

dirty rush activities and ruthless
competition for pledges underes-
timated the character of W&L stu-
dents. He also said that while
academics might not be too seri-
ously affected by fall Rush, argu-
ments that it was actually benefi-
cial were baseless. Because of con-
cems that fraternities would be
adversely affected ﬁnancially by
winter Rush, Ruscio suggested that
the University might by “sympa-
thetic” to these concerns.

As for student autonomy,
Ruscio said he feels that saying
that fraternities are central to W&L
life and then saying that the deci-
sion on Rush should be left solely
up to the fraternities does not fol-
low logically. He said that the de-
cision is so important to the “ﬂow
and rhythm of university life” that
all members of the community
must be involved in it.

Students then asked questions
and commented on Ruscio’s state-
ment. Ruscio responded where he

most of the questions were techni-
cal, trying to understand Ruscio’s
position, one student received scat-
tered applause when he suggested
that the real problem was not the
scheduling of Rush, but some other
problem that has not been ad-
dressed in the 30 years that this
question has been debated. The
student was unable to articulate
what that problem was. ~

Junior Bill Rust, a member 0
Kappa Sigma and the organizer of
the discussion was pleased with
the results.

“I think it went really well. Dean
Ruscio was very articulate and
brought up a lot of points I hadn’t
heard before. I don’t think that he
changed a lot of minds, but that
really wasn’t the purpose,”
Rust said. «

“ He did succeed in advancing
the debate and setting an example
of how that can be done in a civi-
lized manner.”

Juniors Turbeck, Taylor, and sophomores

Hartman, Rayner, Tye win in runoffs

By Pi-:rE WEISSMAN
Phi Staff Writer

If you wanta high position in student
government at Washington and lee, take a
hint from freshman Mary Jo Mahoney,
sophomore Sasha Hartman and junior
Madeline White: start off as vice president
of your class. Both Mahoney and Hartman
became president of their classes after a
year in the number two spot in this week’s
class officer elections. White became chair-
man of the Student Conduct Committee in
the big four elections earlier this ‘month.

More than half of the students in each
classvoted March 20th. Tumoutwas slightly
lower for the sophomore and junior class
runoff elections Thrusday.

TlienewClassof1996officersarePresi-

dent Preston Miller, Vice Presidents Matt
Smith and Bill Trubeck and Executive Com-
mittee representatives Harris Morrison and
Jesse Taylor. About 58 percent of the junior
class voted in the first election, and about 40
percent voted in the runoff.

The new Class of 1997 officers are Presi-
dent Sasha Hartman, Vice President Steve
Fanning and EC representatives Marcus
Rayner and Steve Tye. About 53 percent of
the sophomore class voted in the first elec-
tion with 49 percent voting in the runoff.

The new Class of 1998 ofﬁcers are Presi-
dent Mary Jo Mahoney, Vice President
Stefan Neumeister, and EC representatives
Chris Baldwin and Z. Taylor Shultz. There
were no runoffs needed in the freshman
elections with 54 percent of the class voting.

The elections could be more important
than some students realize, said the next
next freshman class president, Mahoney.

The president and vice president of each
class serve on the Student Conduct Com-
mittee, which disciplines students for un-
gentlemanly behavior.

“I think people should care who is judg-
ing their peers’ conduct,” Mahoney said.

New Freshman Class EC Representative
Chris Baldwin said that it is important that
students, not administrators, evaluate stu-
dent behavior. ‘

“Being able to put yourself in the shoes
of the accused is also a great asset,”
Baldwin said.

One trend in the election: the four candi-
dates who were leading in the first election
won their runoffs. Only Bill Trubeck came
from behind in the first race to win his
runoff as a junior class vice president.

Past experience as a class ofﬁcer helped
many candidates. Only one officer of th
freshman class, Stefan Neumeister, was not

a class officer this year. Baldwin, the cur-
rent freshman class president, will represent
his class on the EC. Freshman Taylor Shultz
was reelected as an EC representative.

In addition to their SCC duties, class
ofﬁcers said they are looking forward to
planning social events with their classes and
fellow ofﬁcers.

Preston Miller, president-elect of the jun-
ior class, said he wants to organize activites
with Bridge the Gap and Kathekon.

Officers disagreed on whether the tum-
out was strong or weak. New Class of 1997
EC representative Steve Tye said the tum-
out was low and unfortunate.

But Neumeister said W&L has a higher
turnout rate than other colleges.

“I think 50 percent of the class [voting] is
great,” Neumeistersaid. ‘Thestudentsmore
or less have to take it upon themselves
to vote.”

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

When I was a freshman at Washington and Lee University, I was
a victim of culture shock. I came from Portland, Oregon, hotbed of
liberalism and the “alternative culture,” and at ﬁrst, I did not
understand the South, the invincibility of time-honored traditions
or the ultra-conservatism of this school. Also, I did not understand
the honor code; though I grew up in a very moral household with a
father who is a pastor, I attended public schools where morality was
never an issue. The students at those schools had no sense of pride
in their honor, or their values; they only prided themselves on not
being caught violating any of the various unworkable rules the
school system put in place.

If I can leave this paper, and this school, with any bit of wisdom,
I would leave you with the incredible respect I have acquired for all
of those things which, at ﬁrst, I thought I hated. Because they were
(sic; clliéferent from everything I knew, I initially put up a defense of

s 1 e. -

I have never, however, been a fan of prejudice or snap judgments,
and I soon grew to love the South, love conservatives, love tradi-
tions. And I developed an undying sense of pride in my honor, a
sense of pride which my friends at other schools will never under-
stand. Having been held to an absolute standard of honesty, I
developed a new sense of self-worth in knowing that I have met the
highest standard of honor and not been found wanting. I have, in
essence, undergone the test of ﬁre, and I am a better person for it.

I took a ﬁnal exam once, in a closed room, alone. I had locked the
doors and closed the shades so I would not be disturbed. I had my
books and notes near me in a backpack, and I came upon a question
which I could not answer. I knew that I could ﬁnd the answer in a
matter of seconds in my notes. I knew no one would ever know that
I had cheated. I could do so, turn in my exam, tell no one, and
graduate unscathed. In high school, I would not have had to think
twice. But my sense of honor was too strong, the respect for the grave
of Robert E. Lee a few hundred feet away, if you will, was too great.
I guessed.

The Executive Committee, as the attendant of the honor code and
its accompanying system of absolute compliance, has come under
ﬁre by many students in the past few weeks. Some younger students
have told me the system is flawed. I have argued that it is as perfect
as any system of its kind can be; it is ultimately workable. No other
honor system, at any school, is. And in at least one student, who did
not understand anything when she came, it has instilled the
incredible sense of respect for her own system of values.

Some interviewers ask me if I made the right choice in coming
three thousand miles to school, in a culture that did not understand
me, which I at ﬁrst thought I disliked. Yes, I made the right choice,
and I will leave Washington and Lee a much better person than
when I came.

Please, if I can leave the students of W&L with anything, take my
respect for the honor system. You will never ﬁnd anything else like

Honor System belongs to stu-
dents not Executive Committee

The Ring-tum Phi, March 24, 1995

To the editor:

Obvious to most on campus, the Executive
Committee has been busy for the past few
weeks. Amidst this activity, we think it is
necessary to explain our position on a
few topics.

When students are found guilty in a closed
earing, they have the choice of leaving and
tarting anew. The conﬁdentiality of our hear-

'ngs gives students a second chance — to go for
pen for a student body jury to decide or to
eave with no scars. On the ﬂip side, however,
ithdrawing students can clamor about the
'njustice of our System, tell an ourtrageous
tory of pure ﬁction, harass those involved —
till walk away. The EC and witnesses shut
their mouths for the good of withdrawing stu-
dents. In return, quilty students often attempt to
disrupt an Honor System theat they could
not handle. .

We have no way to defend ourselves. We
rely on your trust.

We are not looking for sympathy or pats
on the back. We can handle the heat and we
can take the derogatory comments, although
we would prefer your sincere questions.
Howeverrn death threats to the EC and the
harassing of witnesses and jurors not only
the deﬁnition honor, but they are a clear
violation of the guidelines in the
White Book.

If we permit people to break the conﬁ-
dentiality of an Honor Hearing or to harass
those involved, or System would be de-
stroyed by the fear to stand up against dis-
honorable conduct. Do we want you to turn
it in? That’s not the question. This is YOUR

u>HONOR, from page 2

Honor System. You are not required to turn
in suspect students; you are not guilty of an
HV if you do not. If you think that a person’s
actions are an insult to the freedoms we
enjoy or damage the spirit of trust on this
campus, let us know. If not, keep it to
yourself. However, every student must real-
ize that the freedoms that we enjoy are a
result of our perception that the System
works. Along with every freedom comes
the responsibility to protect those very free-
doms. By ignoring an Honor Violation, you
weaken the System. Every student genera-
tion determines how dar it wants the System

people who make up the committee. We are
here to do what you want us to do, and will
never do anything that we believe you would
not do yourselves. We neither hunt down
nor look forward to having a closed hearing.
We investigate each case carefully and make
sure there is enough evidence before we
decide on a closed hearing — which can
take about eight hours. An honest mistake is
not an honor violation.

If you have any question or comments,
dropaletterint he comment boxes in thelaw
school, co-op, or library. Talk to an EC
member or send an e-mail. The only way
that we can clear up misperceptions, prob-
lems, or questions is to encouraging. By the

Potted plants have
roots below the surface

The following, of course, is a response to recent allegations that Washington and Lee
women are to be likened to potted plants. I will try not to fall into the trap of generalizing
about the large and diverse body of women at this institution. I think, however, that I can
show by a couple of examples far more interesting observations could be made about W&L
women than their comparisonto potted plants.

My friend B. is not a potted plant. A potted plant does not come home from practice or
a game with a nail torn off and a bruise so heinous that it has drained into her knee, only

to call her father and tell him that prac-
tice went well, that she enjoyed the

three-mile run. A potted plant does
not fall asleep in the trainingroomwith
an icepack on" each knee, completely
exhausted from a night of studying
for an economics exam after an
away game. I have never seen a potted plant pull such a balancing act between maintaining
above a 3.0 GPA and never missing a day of her sport.

L. carries around a RCASA beeper to parties, knowing that she both cannot drink and
must be home by midnightin case a victim of sexual assault calls her for help. L. is not a
potted plant who waits around at parties for somebody to talk to her.

S. is not a potted plant either. Every week she drives to Central Elementary School to
pick up 1., a little Rockbridge County boy who communicates by either ﬂicking people off
or flashing a cavity-ridden grin. H., who studies for at least seven hours a day, is not of the
plant species. She is an aspiring doctor who believes that acceptance to medical school is
more important than next weekend’s band parties. M. is a socialite, who values her
popularity on campus. She dresses up to go out and calls at least ten people each day. M.
is not a potted plant though. She is always available to her friend who just had a fight with
a boyfriend, or to the guy who just found out his brother was in an accident.

Women must not be judged only by their interaction with men, just as men are not judged
only by their interaction with women. The women at Washington and Lee perhaps no
longer uphold the traditions of this school in that theylwill be heard, they will be leaders,
the will be vibrant, idea-ﬁlled individuals. They can read poetry as expressively as they
chug a beer, and ought to be recognized for both activities. They are, perhaps, no different
from the women at surrounding colleges, except that they are sometimes persecuted for
encroaching upon the “men’s territories” of athletics, Greek life, student government and
academic leadership.

There is no reason why the W&L community should not be one of mutual respect
between the sexes. The institutional element, the 60-40 ratio, is not necessarily degrading
or oppressive to those already admitted; the lack of sorority houses is not even always
perceived as a negative by women. The professors really cannot afford to uphold a bias
against women in the classroom and most indeed would never choose to do so anyway.

If our attitudes are somewhat pre-forrned by our upbringings, there are ample opportu-
nities for enlightenment. The ﬁrst of these is communication and social interaction,
recognizing that we each may indeed have more depth than a potted plant.

great year. Good Luclkl

Hottle sets pace in 2 beast

By STEPHEN WILLIARD
Phi Sports Editor

The men’s swim team ended the year on
a high note, bringing home eight school
records, ﬁve first team All-America awards
and four homorable mention All-Americas.

Nothing could match the honor brought
home by sophomore Nathan Hottle. Hottle
won the national championship in the 200
breast stroke in addition to his ﬁve other
All-American honors.

Head coach Paige Remillard was pleased,
but not necessarily surprised by the results.

“We trained to have that kind of suc-
cess,” remarked Remillard. “We had hoped
for that.”

David Stillman also had a ﬁne showing
ﬁnishing eighth in the 50 freestyle, break-
ing the 13 year old school record and em-
ing him ﬁrst team All-American honors.

Frank Braden earned honorable mention
honors in the 200 and 500 free. ln fact,
Braden’s time in the 500 free rewrote an 18
year old school record.

Both the 400 and 800 freestyle relay
teams all earned All-America status and the
200 free and 400 medley relay teams earned
honorable mention honors.

The 200, 400, and 800 free teams all
broke existing school records. Tony
Diedrich, Stillman, Craig Sears, and Hottle
swam the 200, Stillman, Braden, Sears, and
Diedrich swam the 400 and Diedrich,
Braden, Sears, and Hottle teamed up for the
800 victory.

The last national champion for Remillard
was David Olson who won in the 200 back
in 1989.

When asked if the incredible success
would put any pressure on next year’s squad,
Remillard responded that he didn’t think so.

Remillard was very complimentary of
his athletes, saying, “These guys all paid
their dues in the program.”

He also added, “T 0 go to the National
Championships and come home with a na-
tional champ and ﬁve big ll-America awards
—— you feel good for them.”

Remillard was also impressed with the
fact that all his performers regarded their
relays and the team as extremely important.

“Their driving force was the relays and
the team,” said the coach.

Remillard also added, appropriately,
“They certainly have the right to smile at
their success.”

That is certainly true.

Lacrosse readies for tough test against Roanoke

By Kenn GRANT
Phi Staff Writer

The men’s lacrosse team has risen to its
highest ranking in eight years despite the
team’s ﬁrst loss of the season.

The Generals are currently the #4 team in
Division III lacrosse going into this
Saturday’s showdown with arch-rival
Roanoke College, the nation’s seventh-
ranked team. The game begins at 2:00 on
Wilson Field.

Washington & Lee (5-1) shot over Alfred,
Roanoke, and Denison to the fourth posi-
tion. Ahead of the Generals are defending
national champion Salisbury State in the top
spot, then Gettysburg and Nazareth.

W&L was ranked seventh by the USILA
preseason poll and proceeded to win their
first ﬁve games of the year, matching the
team’s best start since 1980. The Generals
suffered their ﬁrst loss last Saturday, though,
falling 17-13 to second-ranked Gettysburg.

Senior co-captain Scott Mackley scored
three times and is co-leader of the Generals
with 17 goals, tied with junior Ande Jenkins.

The Bullets, though, got ﬁve goals from
sophomore Dave Curry to offset the one
goal/one assist performance from
Gettysburg’s single-season points record-
holder Tim Demore.

W&L’s senior midﬁelder Ty Tydings
registered one goal and three assists, raising
his team-high assists total to 13.

This annual match-up of regional rivals
routinely decides the Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference championship. Since W&L
entered the ODAC in 1987, the teams have
combined for seven of eight conference
titles, with the Maroons winning four.

Each school has earned three trips to the
NCAA Division III Touniament in that time
span. In fact, in 1987 both teams were sent
into postseason play and met in the
quarterﬁnals. The Generals avenged the
previous week’s 15-14 double-overtime loss
to the Maroons and won the playoff matchup
19-1 1.

Washington & bee ﬁrst put their I-81
southern neighbors on the Generals’ sched-
ule in 1967.

The ﬁrst nine games were won by W&L,
a Division I power for much of that stretch.
Since Roanoke ﬁrst toppled the Generals in
1978, though, the teams have split their last
18 meetings.

This year, Roanoke (4-2) is out for re-
venge. The Generals (3-0 ODAC) are two-
time defending ODAC champions after hav-
ing taken the last two games between the
schools in a pair of one-goal decisions. Last
season’s loss clearly hurt Roanoke the most.
While W&L was off to a subpar 3-3 start, 1-

1 in the ODAC, the Maroons were cruising
through their early schedule and, having the
advantage of hosting the W&L game,
seemed on their way to becoming league
champions for the eleventh time ever.

With an 1 1-6 lead six minutes away from
victory, Roanoke was stung by ﬁve straight
W&L goals to force overtime. In OT, Jenkins
fed Tydings for the game-winner in one of
the school’s greatest victories ever.

The one-goal difference marked the fifth
occasion a single accurate shot separated
W&L and Roanoke.

Despite their second-place ODAC fin-
ish, the Maroons entered this year as the
fifth-rated team in Division III. With key
returnees such as midﬁelder JJ Blatt (32
goals in ‘94), Roanoke still ﬁgures to be a
toumament contender.

The team’s ﬁrst defeat was a demoraliz-
ing 30-8 beating on their home turf by
Salisbury St., a team some lacrosse observ-
ers feel could rank among the top Division
I schools. They have also lost to current #5
Ohio Wesleyan in a 15-14 overtime thriller.

The Generals, however, have not lost
two in a row in ﬁve years and may be
ﬁelding the school’s best team since their
drop from Division I play following the
1986 season.

After a perfect 5-0 start, W&L traveled
up to Pennsylvania last weekend to face #2
Gettysburg. The Bullets had won the previ-

ous four meetings between the two, includ-
inga 10-7 battle at Rockbridge County High
School last year.

The Generals hung with the #2 team
well, though. W&L made it a 10-8 affair
midway through the third, but four straight
Bullets’ goals put the game away. In fact,
four of Curry’s ﬁve goals came in the ﬁnal
30 minutes.

Freshman Sam Horstrnan, junior Russell
Croft, and senior Andy Dutton contributed
two goals apiece. Jenkins, who leads the
team with 23 points, was held to just one
score, along with juniors Duncan Slidell
and Adam Butterworth.

Gettysburg featured too much speed and
dominated on face-offs, 26-8, in ﬁnishing
with a ﬂourish for the 17-13 win.

The 17 goals were the most allowed by
W&Lsince 1991. Sophomore Doug Gubner
made 18 saves, equaling his career-high, as
his team was outshot 53-34. The Generals,
though, are still just allowing an average of
less than eight goals per game.

Following the Roanoke game, W&L
meets a lesser ODAC opponent at Wilson
Field on Wednesday. The Generals host
Guilford at 3:00, a school they have never
lost to.

The Generals are then off for exams until
they travel to Virginia Wesleyan April 9 to
wrap up their conference schedule and, they
hope, a third straight ODAC championship.

You’re outta here!

By MiA WALLACE
Twist Champion of the Phi Staff

In an unprecedented action, the
Washington and Lee University Board
of Trustees announced yesterday that
they have “changed [their] minds” about
choosing John W. Elrod as University
president. John Wilson’s replacement
will be none other than “Sexpert”
Suzi Landolphi.

In a press release the trustees ex-
plained this unexpected change of plans.

“Washington and Lee students are
concerned with the relationship between
themselves and the administration. They
believe their student autonomy is being
threatened. We want them to know that

. we understand theirGeneration X angst.
We want the students to know that we’re
in touch, that we’re...how do you
say...cool cats. With this in mind,
Landolphi seemed the ideal choice. She
loves them crazy kids.”

 

Washington and Lee’s Executive Committee introduced the new mass honor trial in
Lee Chapel Thursday. All students were instructed to stand while the charges
against them were read by special guest prosecutor, Bob Tompkins. After booting
all the students suspected of committing a honor violation, Tompkins was found
guilty of misuse of fund and a cocky attitude. His diploma was revoked. Current

Landolphi’s acceptance speech was
originally scheduled to be held at Lee
Chapel, but in a nod to the affection
W&Lstudents have for tradition, moved
her appearance to Evans Dining Hall at
the last minute. Landolphi stated that it
was “way cool” to have the honor of

“lots of plans” for Washington and
Lee. Landolphi plans to officially
change Michelle Richardson’s title to
Dean of Fun so students won’t have to
learn her proper title. She then hopes to
team up with Richardson to start a
series of Condom Coffeehouses.
Landolphi has already begun plans to
convert Lee’s former office in the base-
ment of Lee Chapel to a branch of
her chain of stores condom
stores, Condomania.

The response of Washington and
Lee students has varied. Although
Evans Dining Hall was packed with
students eager to hear Landolphi’s ac-
ceptance speech, some students were
unhappy with the announcement. When
asked his opinion about the Landolphi
presidency, Spectator editor Allen
Gillespie said, “What? No, no, it can’t
be. Tell me you’re kidding.”

In an interview with the Phi, Elrod
stated that he was “fine with
Landolphi’s taking the job.” Elrod has
chosen not to return to his previous
position as Dean of the College. He
instead plans to take over the presi-
dency of Southern Virginia College for
Women in a glorious and bloodless
coup d’ etat. Elrod says that working at
SVCW will be a pleasant change

APRIL 1, 1995

Elrod nomination
retracted, Landolphi
new W&L president

he explained, “Mimi and I can just
relax and ride horses.”

Elrod does, however, have more
plans than just horseback riding. He
says that the first item on his agenda is
to officially change the name of the
school to Sem. Elrod said, “Sem will fit
much better on sweatshirts than South-
em Virginia College for Women. Be-
sides, it’s shorter and our students will
have a much easier time remembering
it, plus by the time they graduate most
should be able to spell it.”

The trustees have accepted Elrod’s
resignation and have already announced
his replacement as Dean of the Col-
lege. Paul “Pee-Wee Herman” Reubens
will take Elrod’s office at the begin-
ning of next year’s school year.

When asked by the Phi to comment
on his new position, Herman answered,
“I know you are, but what am I?”

Herman also expressed excitemen‘
to be reunited with an old friend from
the time he was in jail. In a completely

Phi Member Who Fears God

The water fountains and bathroom sinks at
the Lexington Police Department were emit-
ting a red substance one police officer said was
“blood” yesterday in the fourth of a series of
possibly related incidents which began last fall.

“Honey, y’all know we just can’t drink
blood,” said chief of police and friend to women
everywhere Bruce Beard. “It doesn’t get your
hands real clean, either, you know what I mean?”

The incident occurs several days after swarms
of unidentified ﬂying and hopping insects filled
the cells and offices of the police station. A
convict who was arrested in a completely unre-
lated incident, said the insects ate all his deli-
cious prison food.

“It was bad enough when they locked me up
with that horrible scary person, Dan Odenwald,
but then the locusts ate my eggs,” said Jeffrey
Dahmer. “I mean, a man’s gotta eat, you
know?”

It was unclear whether or not Dahmer actu-
ally enjoyed the bloody water.

Police analysts, working closely with Wash-
ington and Lee alumnus Pat Robertson, say
these incidents may be linked to last fall’s arrest

‘of “Eric” Christ.

In a completely unrelated aspect of this
story, Christ spent the night in jail with Dan
Odenwald, future Phi Executive Editor and
butt of Prof. Jennings’ jokes.

“I guess it goes to show that you shouldn’t
mess around with our Lord,” said Robertson,
who added that he would be asking for funds on
his weekly television broadcast to restore the

“Hall o’Pedestrian Safety Plaques” which was
mostly destroyed by the-insects when they built
nests among them.

Goatee said he was unsure about what steps
to take.

“I mean, honey, in Egypt and all, I would
have just let the people go,” said Mustache.
“But, honey, I don’t have any slaves, and I’ve
gone to confession and all.”

A local minister called the incident
“plagues.”

“It’s all there in the Word,” he said. He cited
the recent incident in which all the power was
cut off to the entire city of Lexington, except the
Sigma Nu fraternity house and the Graham-
Lees dormitory, for three days. “Read your

W&L students assaulted by Lex

By AMY FISHER
Phi Staff Slut and Gun-Toter

Washington and Lee students have
always considered Lexingtonto be some
sort of Utopia, where violent crime is
not possible. On Friday, March 17, this
vision was proven to be just
an illusion.

That night, two Washington and Lee
students were accosted on their way
home from a party. Three Lexington
residents, believed to be students at
Rockbridge County High Schools, ha-
rassed and attacked the students using a
slingshot, a pea-shooter, and
several sticks.

According to the W&L students,
their attackers stopped them in front of
Sharks on Nelson Street. They began

by calling them names such as
“Dummy,” “Puke Face,” and “Dork.”
When the victims tried to ignore the
taunts, their harassers revealed their
weapons and demanded beer. When
the students‘ told their attackers that
they had no beer, only a half-ﬁlled
ﬂask, the scene turned violent. Ac-
cording to the two victims, their at-
tackers attempted to swing the sticks
at them, used the slingshot to attempt
to hurl small pebbles at them, and shot
peas at them through their straw. After
approximately two minutes of ﬁght-
ing, one of the attackers noticed that it
was past their curfew and the three
left, presumably to go home.

One student was hit in the back of
the neck with a pea and was treated at
the inﬁrrnary with Sudafed and Extra-
Strength Tylenol, and a year’s supply

of birth control pills. The other sus-
tained no serious injuries.

“I was terriﬁed,” said one of the
victims. “Sure they were only sticks,
but you don’t understand. They were
really big sticks. I mean, really big.”
His companion shared his fear.

“If you’ve ever been the victim of a
ﬂying pea, you know how I feel. It
smarts, it really does.”

The two students also voiced reser-
vations about going out at night in
the future.

One of them said, “It really changed
the way I feel about Lexington. It’s just
not safe. I don’t think I’ll be walking
around much more after dark, unless
there’s like, a really good band play-
ing. Or if they have Natural Light.”

Three teenagers were arrested Sat-
urday morning and were taken to Rock-

youths, police arrest suspects

bridge County Jail, where they shared
a cell with The Ring—tum Phi felon/
future Executive Editor Dan Odenwald.

Odenwald said, “Yeah, they were
pretty shady. Hey, what the hell are
you doing writing about my arrest in
the paper? That doesn’t have anything
to do with the story at all.”

Washington and Lee head of secu-
rity Mike Young advises W&L stu-
dents to be careful when they are out
after dark.

He advises students to avoid poorly
lit areas, to try not to walk past Sharks,
to walk in groups, and to wear turtle-
necks.

Young said, “There’s no sense in

can be a dangerous place. Be careful
and watch out for that Dan Odenwald.”

Dean of Fun finds funk with Clinton

By Lrsr ME Sr-:r You UP
Phi Match Maker

As the strains of Harry Connick Jr. ’s “A Wink and
a Smile” rolled through her University Center ofﬁce
around 5 p.m. one Friday evening, Michelle
Richardson readied for yet another night on the town
in Metro-Lex.

“I just haven’t had time to think since I was on that
Dating Game show,” Richardson said. “I have men
calling me at all hours of the day and night, trying to
convince me that they’re Mr. Right.”

Richardson, however, has no desire to change her
name to “Michelle Richardson-Right.” As 5:03 p.m.
rolled around, a familiar face showed at her door.

“Hi, Georgie!” she said. “Dosen’t the pink jumpsuit
ﬂatter his eyes, Sarah?”

Ever since Michelle Richardson and George
Clinton met during Richardson’s appearance on
Washington and Lee’s would-be equivalent to “The
Love Connection,” starring Washington and Lee’s
would-be Chuck Woolery (or maybe that guy on
“Studs”), she has been sleepless in Lexington. Week-
end trips to Tahiti, or even the Mothership, evenings
jamming with the Parliament Funkadelic, or just
hanging around thrillin’ or watching PC U on video,
it has all been, in Richardson’s own words,
“kinda fun.”

Richardson remembers that fateful day when she
met the man of her dreams.

“I was on that ‘Dating Game’ thing,” she said. “I
had to choose between the Bachelor #1, Bachelor #2,
and Bachelor #3. I chose #2 and the rest has been one
big party.”

Richardson said she chose Clinton because she
liked his answer to the question, “What is your
favorite body part?”

Clinton answered, with a groovin’ lilt to his voice,
“I want to do it to you in your earhole.”

Richardson said she does not regret turning down
the other two choices, who were Professor of History
Jefferson Davis Futch and sophomore Chris Wick.

“They didn’t have any good answers,” she said.
“Bachelor #1 just kept raving about how he would
treat me just like Queen Victoria, whatever that
means, and Bachelor #3 couldn’t stop talking about
how much he hated funk music, school spirit, and
student activities.”

Clinton says he likes Richardson so much because
she’s “truly a * * **** * spacechild—I just *“"“ thrill
****1UlK* **#*##****  hen”

When he heard her voice, Clinton said he had a
“* * * * good "‘ * * "‘ * vibe” about Richardson.

“***#=lI* **IlU|I#**lKlI¥$ tttt ttttﬁi lﬂﬁﬁi,”
he said.

Richardson isn’t sure yet how dating George
Clinton will change her lifestyle. “There’s only so
much I could really change anyway. There aren’t any
places where you can get feathered extensions put in
your hair in a place like Lexington.” Richardson does
admit that Clinton (or “My little funk mufﬁn,” as she

several students will live in newly cre-
ated quarters beneath Lee Chapel, on
the top floor of Lee House, and in a
special “tent city” to be constructed on
Wilson Field.

“The new ‘tent city’ will be named
‘Wilsonville’ to honor our departing
president, John D. Wilson,”
said Manning.

“There may be confusion about the
name, but let’s face it, every ﬁre hy-

drant here is named after somebody.

“It was bound to happen sooner
or later.”

Asked how he felt about the naming
of the new facility, retiring President
John D. Wilson replied, “I’m
deeply honored?”

According to Manning, the univer-
sal requirement may raise up to
$800,000 of additional funds.

“Before students react badly, they
should ask themselves just how many
little faux-metal alumni dedicatory
plaques $800,000 can buy,”

said Manning.

Junior Andrew Olmem disagreed.

“Once again the administration has
decided to suppress the students’ inde-
pendence that has made W&Lfamous.”

Manning said he is of the opinion
that although there has been “some
scattered student opposition,” the policy
will be in the best interests of
W&L’s future.

Manning said that the new policy is
comparable to four-year housing re-
quirements at other universities. He
said that it is rare for students to have

“They just lived where they were

expect no less of W&L’s students,”
Manning said.

Junior Andrew Olmem disagreed.

“Once again the administration has

Pearl Jam rejoices as they find out. SAB contracted them.

SAB brings Pearl Jam to W&L

by LUDWIG VAN HALEN
Phi Music Reporter

The Student Activities Board has announced
Pearl Jam will play the Student Pavillion March
31 in an attempt to convince students that it
actually does have a clue when it comes to
selecting bands.

Pearl Jam is currently touring in northern
Virginia and was looking for a small, conserva-
tive, and generally backward college to play.

, 2j‘fAl'ghough_j(’s l')Qi.0l1I normal fare, it sounded
like the description fit, so we went for it,” said
SAB Entertainment Director Drew Denbo,

Wayne Newton was also touring northern
Virginia and gave Pearl Jam a run for its money
for the SAB contract.

Students “strongly urged” their friendly SAB
members to vote for Pearl Jam.

“Personally, I wanted to book Wayne New-
ton for the March concert, but the death threats
inﬂuenced my decision in favor of Pearl Jam,”
said Denbo.

The SAB has been criticized in the past for
its less than popular decisions regarding choos-
ing bands.“l think the ﬁnal straw was when
they booked New Kids on the Block,” said
junior Kiki Moronos, “l m,ean,_§ liked them
when I was young, but it’s different now.”

Senior Biff Lohser agreed.“Pearl Jam or

Wayne Newton? Even though Wayne Newton
is related to “Wayne” Night Owl Wayne, Pearl
Jam kicks,” said Lohser.The student body de-
manded the SAB take a moral inventory of
itself in an effort to mainstream their attitudes
toward music.

After an extensive review of its internal
working structure that involved two tons of
chocolate pudding, several barrels of whip
cream, and a life-size poster of Roseanne Barr
(excuse me, Arnold. Wait didn’t they get a
divorce?), the SAB emerged reorganized and
invigorated.

‘‘It was a lot like fraternity initiation, kinda
of scary, kinda messy, and really gooey,” said
SAB member Kris Swick. In a completely

Dean Alanen was arrested Saturday night for
being drunk in public.

He spent the night in jail with Jesus Christ
who was visiting his little—known brother,
Vinnie, serving time for grand theft auto. Pearl
Jam was excited about the concert.

“Michael Stipe of REM said W&L was one
of the best concerts they played, so we decided
to give it a shot,” lead singer Eddie Veddar
said.

The SAB vowed to make a concerted effort
to try to lure more attractive bands for W&L’s
listening pleasure.“If it turns out half as well as

This is an editorial about everything, about life,
about God and the beatnik botthavista generational
explosion of love, freedom, deep thought, poetry and
everything good about the world. This is about dollar
mugs from a vitamin manufacturer full of good, cheap
wine and bottles of dark beer late in the night, smuggled
in and out in backpacks, coat pockets, anything. This
is about Biblical references mixed happily with sexual
connotations until we wonder which is more holy.
This is about DJD] and deep discussions about noth-
ing for hours. This is about making decisions, impor-
tant decisions, late late at night at wits end and having
them be the basis for the way 3000 people see me.
Life, you know, is short and will ultimately end in
happiness if you live it right. This is how I see it. God
is there, there for you if you will just listen to him late
at night and sometimes when you lie out in the sun
alone with only the distant sounds of humanity to
remind you of the world. This is what I have learned
at Washington and Lee: respect the South, respect and
understand that alcohol can be a beneﬁt, you can
learn to drink socially, or you can learn alcoholism,
either one can come from a four— or five-year stint at
the Grand Old School of the South. Jack Kerouac was
all right and all wrong, had it right about meditating on
the world, knew how to write a sentence like none
you’ve ever seen, but he wasn’t successful the way I
want to be, the way this school has taught be how to
be. I’ve learned the value of conservatism and a well-
placed word of praise. Learned to ﬂatter without lying,
learned to tell the truth without pissing everyone off.
Learned to be a lady when I could, learned to be hard-
edged when I had to. And I have more patience than
the day is long, than the night is cold, than — but you
know the story has to start at the beginning, not at the
end, and this is really the beginning, a beginning I
have been waiting not—so—patiently for years, almost
here, thanks W&L, thanks Robert E. Lee, you will have
made it happen.

So I have earned what I could not buy, and maybe
I will be the better for it. Maybe we will all have been
the better for it. Maybe I made a difference.

But I never stopped loving. I’m the only one, but I
never stopped, not even. . .and that is the reason I have
gained from Washington and Lee what I could have
gained nowhere else, given here what I could have
given nowhere else, this is the reason, this is the right
way to understand the world, or at least I hope.

(This is beat. You’re not supposed to understand it
all. Or any of it, for that matter. Just be, just listen to
the rhythms of spontaneous thought. The best writing
is done in a trance, the pre-Raphealites knew it, the
religious bards knew it, Kerouac knew it.)

Quote of the Week...

“The best way to understand the rhythms of humanity is
through the unalterable state of the universe late at night with
several shots of Old Elijah Craig under your belt.”

No one said this. It just sounded cool. But, hey, you can

pretend you said it if you like.

Alex Waxes almost
oetic in an attempt

to parody the practi-

cally un—parody-able

FAR MIDDLE
x Chri n 11

Some people might think it’s easy
to parody yourself. I mean, comedy
isn’t really that hard, when you get
down to brass tacks. As Dick Van
Dyke told Richie’s second grade class,
“Comedy is the art of the unexpected.”
He demonstrated this by leaving the
room and walking back in, then trip-
ping. Then he, like, acted like a tight-
rope walker except he was really right
there on the little raised platform, and
everybody knew that if he fell, he
wouldn’t fall very far. Boy, those sec-
ond-graders were laughing like crazy.
But then, they were being paid to...

So anyway, the point is, it shouldn’t
be very hard to come up with an amus-
ing few paragraphs to lighten your
miserable hearts, new full with the
knowledge that you’ll soon be leaving
little Lexington and heading to exotic
locales throughout the Southeast and
Europe. «

But nooooooooooo. That would be
too easy. See, the thing is, I’m a little
sick right now. Every time it gets to be
good weather, I come down with fits of
sneezing and coughing and term pa-
pers due. It’s almost enough to make
me believe in divine justice, if God was
like, a real spiteful old codger who
likes to watch good people suffer.

And now, a short poem, composed
when I was eleven years old:

 

The angry crowd grew silent,
The officer took me away,
All because I painted the
mayor in a little lingerie.

That’s right, I was writing social
satire when I was just a cute, little boy.

But why include it in your parody col-
umn? you ask. First, to show off the
fact that I knew how to pronounce
“lingerie” when I was eleven. But basi-
cally it’s an excuse. I’ve been writing
non-stop since I was eleven, and now,
well, I just need a little break.

Say, I could do what I do on my

wanted to hear, that member yells out,
“That’s it!” Unfortunately, the process
is still a bit rough, since the deejay is
the only one who really knows what he
wants, and he can’t really hear people
when they yell out, but...uh...think of
the technology! Breathtaking, ,;no?
So, see, my idea is, I’ll just start on

show, “The ticular

pression—no, this time I mean the
amazing new technological break-
through called Interactive Song Search
(ISS). This process is so high-tech that
I can’t fully explain it to you unless
you’ve taken some advanced computer
science and electrical engineering
courses, but I’ll try to give you a brief
idea of how it works.

The deejay (stay with me here, I
know the jargon can get confusing)
puts in a CD and explains that the ISS
is about to begin. Then he will hit
PLAY on the CD player and listen to
the ﬁrst song, along with the teeming
audience of rock fans. They are trying
to find the song the deejay wants to
hear that he doesn’t know the name of,
but he does know what album it’s on.
When a member of the audience thinks
that the deejay has found the song he

it, the column will be done!

This week, my columnwillbeabout
Pedro Wilson, the governor of Califor-
nia. I believe I have revealed here be-
fore that he and his compadre, Miguel
Huffington, are really illegal aliens sent
here to take over the government and
drive first California, then the world,
into bankruptcy and despair. Now,
Pedro has come one step closer to ac-
complishing that goal, forming a presi-
dential exploratory committee into
whose accounts he can funnel his food
stamp money and welfare checks. It’s
a heinous plot, and since I’m from
California, it’s my duty...

Y’know, the basic problem with Pat
Buchanan is, he’s a liberal panderer.
That’s right, you heard me. Pat
Buchanan has sold out his loyal sup-
porters and moved into the camps of

the left, abandoning we good protec-
tionist, isolationists without so much
as a (Sarah Gilbert, Phi Executive Edi-
tor: “This column better be
enteitaining...or it’s your a** I”)...

I have a bad feeling about Phil
Gramm. Ever since he announced that
he was running for president, it seems
like I’ve had a lot less money in my
pocket. I remember this little mini-
Depression started exactly the day af-
ter Gramm announced. Sure the stock
market hit 4000 about that time, but,
not by coincidence, that’s also when I
put a ﬁve-dollar bill in the change-
making machine in the Graham-Lees
laundry room and only got four quar-
ters back. Imagine what might happen
if Gramm were elected to the White
House... .

If there were any justice in this
country, Cecil Andrus would already
be President. I lived in Idaho for five
years while he was the governor. While
he had been President Carter’s Secre-
tary of the Interior, his Republican
replacement had signed a devil’s deal
with the U.S. government allowing
them to store nuclear waste at the Idaho
National Engineering Laboratory in
Blackfoot. Andrus fought the ruling in
court, lost, then personally stopped
every shipment at the border on the
grounds that the trucks transporting
them were unsafe. He once turned back
a truck because the light bulb in the
glove co when I put a five-dollar bill in
the change-making machine in the Gra-
ham-Lees laundry room and only got
four quarters back. Imagine what might
happen if Gramm were elected to the
White House...mpartment was burnt
out. This is not a man who would
bother consulting the UN about invad-
ing Haiti...

Good night, folks! Thank you! I’m
here every other Friday!

Really strange and bizarre Bookwalter nightmare

By READA BOOKWALTER
Phi Assistant Sports Editor

The greater metropolitan Lex-
ington area is just not a haven for
successful sports teams.

Besides our awesome Wash-
ington and Lee Division I sports
machine, which continually turns
out professional draft picks, and
VMI, who played the North Caro-
lina Tar Heels this year, where is
our next biggest sports city?

The answer is Washington
D.C., which currently boasts three
major professional sports fran-
chises.

Actually, “boasts” is not the
correct word to use, considering
the teams are the Redskins, Bul-
lets, and Capitals.

The Redskins ﬁnished 3-13
last season, the Bullets are occu-
pying the NBA Eastern Division
basement, and the Caps are not
exactly tearing up the NHL.

The amazing thing is, there
are people who actually get ex-
cited over them. If you ever get
really bored someday, turn on
HTS.

When there’s not a lawn bowl-
ing or a jai-alai match on, most
likely there will be a Bullets or a
Caps game on, or even worse, a

Bullets replay.

During commercial breaks, a
young man ﬁlls the screen, yell-
ing, “Johnny 0 here, BIG BUL-
LETS FAN!”

This man has guts. He is the
only person l’ve ever seen who
openly admits that he’s a Bullets
fan. At least he’s honest, but the
viewer has to question his mental
stability.

Recently, Johnny O proved
how big a Bullets fan he is by
showing highlights of Patrick
Ewing dunking over the Bullets
in a promo for an upcoming
Knicks-Bullets contest.

Maybe then you’re wonder-
ing how a team of Washington
sports figures (including the
Georgetown Hoyas, who while
presently are getting lucky in the
NCAA Tournament, possess
some interesting personalities and
names) would fare against a squad
of NBA All-Stars.

OK, probably not, but stay
with me during this dream se-
quence.

Washington starts Juwan
Howard at power forward, Don
Reid at small forward, Allen “The
Mad Bomber” Iverson at point
guard, Chris “The Wanna-Be
Mad Bomber” at shooting guard,
and the NBA’s perennial weight
problem, Kevin Duckworth at

center.

The All-Stars counter with
Eric Montross at power forward,
Charles Barkley at small forward,
Muggsy Bogues at the point,
Vernon Maxwell playing shoot-
ing guard, and His Shaqness,
Shaquille O’Neal, manning the
pivot, not to mention co-captain
Sue Deutsch.

John Thompson directs the
Washington attack, while Gary
Fallon and Verne Canﬁeld co-
coach the All-Stars. At the
announcer’s table are Dick Vitale,
and of course, Johnny 0.

The first half is a display of
basketball at its best. Reid fouls
out ﬁve minutes into the contest
and is replaced by Othella
Harrington, who fails to grab a
rebound or score for the remain-
der of the half.

Iverson commits 17 turn-
overs, and Webber connects on
1-16 three-point attempts.

After Thompson grew weary
of consulting a sun dial to time
Duckworth’s movement up the
court, he yanks Kevin and inserts
the 7’7” Romanian legend‘,
Gheorghe Muresan, who imme-
diately trips and falls.

The Stars fare worse. Max-
well is ejected after he jumped
into the stands and fought all 15
of the people present for heck-

ling him.

Shaq and Montross are both
tossed for arguing after Shaq
smashed a backboard over
Muresan.

Shaq completes the perfor-
mance by falling on his butt.

The Stars’ Christian Laettner
replaces Shaq, but is also given
the hook after he deliberately
stomped on Muresan’s face.

Washington receives ten tech-
nical free throws as a result of the
ejections, but Webber, normally
a 95% free throw shooter, cans
one of them.

“Webber’s a PT player,
babeeeee!” hyperventilates
Vitale.

“BIG Webber fan!” Johnny 0
adds.

At halftime, Washington leads
10-2, and while the W&L march-
ing band and cheerleaders enter-
tain the fans who have come
dressed as empty seats,

Fallon rants and raves at his
team in the locker room.

“You’re all pathetic!” he bel-
lows. “My football teamscored
as many points in our ﬁrst three
games as you’ve done in this
half. You absolutely reek!”

Incited by Fallon’s speech,
the All-Stars came out pumped
to start the second half.

Bogues repeatedly dunked

over Muresan and the All-Stars’
Dennis Rodman, sporting a head
of grass, collected 37 rebounds
in the second half as the All-Stars
roared back to within 17-13 with
less than eight minutes remain-
ing.
With the game tightening,
Canﬁeld and Fallon inserted their
secret weapons, forwards Robert
Hull and Cam Dyer, and center
Mark Connelly, replacing Shawn
Bradley and Will Perdue, who
both fouled out.

Sparked by these first-round
picks, the All-Stars embarked on
a streak. Following
Washington’s Desmond
Howard’s dropped alley-oop pass
from Heath Schuler,

Rodman sinks the first basket
of his career to push the Stars
into the lead for the first time, 28-
26 with 55 seconds left.

Hull fouls Webber, who with
the pressure mounting, calmly
steps to the line and bricks both
free throws.

“I hate all of you!” bellows
Barkley. .

Washington received another
chance after Barkley travels.
Washington’s Boubacar Aw fed
the ball to a confused Muresan
behind the arc.

As the buzzer sounded,

#

which loads six rows back in, the
seats.

The Stars prevailed 28-26.

A deliriously happy Bogues
finished with 7 points to earn,
honors as the game’s high scorer.

“Yaaaahhh, what a game!”
Vitale shrieked.

W&L tenured professor of
English, Moses Malone, and
assistent professor of publid
speaking Jason Kidd were im-
pressed by by the Stars’ come-
back.

“Shlbtuiytsmaptquk,” Kidd
commented. p

“Moses say they did good,”
Malone mentioned. “I like the
way they play. They play good
like Moses do.”

Fallon and Canﬁeld were less
enthused over the game.

“We deserved to lose,” Fallon
stated. “We would have lost to
that poor excuse of a team if it
hadn’t been for Muresan. I didn’t
realize he was that lousy.” x

“I never want to see a perfor-
mance like this again,” Canﬁeld
mused. “Games like this make

, me glad I won’t be coaching bas-

ketball anymore.”

The nightmare is over now,‘

No one was injured in a plane crash at Wilson Field last week. Just ignore the annoying FAA guys.

 

Just the facts: The Guru is on patrol.

By OLD MAN GRANT
Phi Sports Guru

Wilson’s football career cel-
ebrated: Michigan State
University’s basketball team is
out of the running for the national
title, but a previous MSU cham-
pionship group is getting back
together.

The 1952 college football na-
tional champion Spartans are re-
uniting to honor their former
standout defensive back, John D.
Wilson.

Yes, our university president
will be the guest of honor at the
ESPN televised-Chris Albert
hosted event on May 1 to cel-
ebrate his retirement.

“That team was a tremendous
part of my life and it is an honor
to be a part of this reunion,” said
Wilson, a member of the Aca-
demicAll-America Hall of Fame.

Rumor has it that Wilson’s
number “60/40” jersey will be
retired during the ceremony, but
organizers are mum on any pos-
sible tributes.

“John was the brick of that
national title team and we will
honor him in the appropiate way,”
said former Wilson teammate and
co-captain of the ‘52 Spartans,
Sue Deutsch.

Hottle off to Atlanta: Newly

crowned national 200 back cham-
pion Nathan Hottle will become
Washington & Lee’s ﬁrst swim-
mer ever to compete in the Sum-
mer Olympics.

Hottle’s performance at the
Division III nationals last week-
end eamed the sophomore the
automatic berth on the Team USA
that will compete in Atlanta.

“Nathan’s selection was a di-
rect corelation to the scientiﬁ-
cally enhanced training methods
that we employ on our swim-
mers,” coach Page Remillard
said, we think.

Hottle was in his apartment
Tuesday when he was informed
by team

co-captain Sue Deutsch of his
Olympic selection.

Farrar Becomes Lax Hall-of-
Famer: Jim Farrar, W&L’s Di-
rector of Alumni Programs and
former lacrosse All-American,
became the last member of the
1974 Generals to be inducted into
the National Lacrosse Hall of
Fame.

“Jim made it? Are you kid-
ding me?” was the reaction of
Hall of Famer Ted Bauer.

“I thought they had stan-
dards?” said F arrar’s former part-
ner on defense, Rob Lindsay.

For the last ten years, Farrar
was the only member of that 15-
1 squad not to be inducted into
the Hall, located in Baltimore.

All other players, coach Jack
Emmer, assistant Chuck
O’Connell, the equipment man-
ager, the three fans that inspired
the come-from behind win over
Towson State, a Ring-tum Phi
sports writer, and 12 former
Southern Sem cheerleaders had
all received the honor.

The cheerleaders weren’t ac-
tually used at W&L’s games, but
the committee thought “what the
heck.”

One member of the ‘74 Gen-
erals was happy for Farrar, sort
of.

“Well, since he’s standing in
the background in that immortal
photo of Teddy Bauer from the
Hopkins game, I guess he de-
serves it,” said former Generals’
co-captain Sue Deutsch.

Keenan takes basketball helm:
Mike Keenan, coach of the St.
Louis Blues of the NHL, has
signed on to take over W&L’s
basketball program.

“Even though Mike has never
coached basketball before, we’re
happy to have someone of his
caliber agree to a long-term con-
tract and commit himself to the
rebuilding of the program,” said
Mike Walsh, athletic director.

Keenan announced he was
leaving the Blues at the end of

. the season because of a clause in

his contract that allowed him to
pursue a buyout if the GOP ever

regained control of both houses,
John Travolta got an Oscar nomi-
nation, Weber State made the
NCAA Tournament, Oil Can
Boyd ever played baseball again,
and a woman was elected presi-
dent of W&L’s Student Conduct
Committee.

“Damn! Weren’t we lucky!”
said Generals’ basketball co-cap-
tain Sue Deutsch.

The university is not con-
cerned about losing Keenan after
just one season, like the New
York Rangers and St. Louis did.
Apparently Keenan can only pur-
sue a buyout if every surviving
member of Ken Ruscio’s infa-
mous 1990-91 freshmen “envi-
ronmental hall” graduates by this
June.

“Sucker!” said Walsh.

Ripken rolls on: Senior
women’s lacrosse goddess
Nicole Ripken played her 114th
consecutive game in which she
scored a goal with one second
remaining.

Yet, Ripken has continued to
hear criticism that she is allow-
ing the streak to affect her play.
Some observers have claimed
that she purposely holds the ball
until the ﬁnal second in order to
keep the streak alive.

“That’s absurd,” said assis-
tant coach Jami “Pour this in
your shot glass, Jac”

Daningsburg.
Ripken dismissed as possible
evidence the recent game in

which she held onto the ball for

the final eleven minutes of the
game, running circles around the
field, then scoring with a second
to go.

“If I didn’t score with one
second left, Keith would have
nothing left to write about!” she
said.

The Generals continued to
express their support of Ripken
and her streak in a statement from
team co-captain Sue Deutsch.

Dadio trial enters day 41: The
double-murder trial of Terry
Dadiotookadramatictum Thurs-
day with the testimony of W&L
security guard Baner.

Baner testified to finding a
bloody glove in the back seat of
his Ford Bronco, the vehicle that
Dadio and Brenda Davis used in
an escape from police custody
last fall.

Under cross-examination, the
defense attempted to have Baner
admit to being a sexist who hated
Dadio and wanted all women to
leave W&L.

One-hundred-fourteen fresh-
men women are scheduled to tes-
tify in Baner’s defense.

Dadio, head volleyball and
women’s basketball coach, is
being tried for the murder of her
former lover J_.C. “Kato” Coyne

and Jami Daningsburg, assistant.’
women’s lacrosse coach.

Coyne, who was the assistant
sports information director, had
broke off the relationship after
years of physical and emotional
abuse by Dadio and had a re-‘
straining order against the former
hoops star.

The prosecution intends to use
a taped 911 call by Coyne as
evidence of Dadio’s threatening):
and abusive temper.

But according to Coyne’s
former boss, Brian Logue, “J.C.
wasa wimp, anyway.”

Coyne and Daningsburg, a),
“friend”, were murdered outside
their Woods Creek apartments

, last October.

The defense alleges that Dadio
could not have committed the
murders due to injuries suffered V
during her basketball playing
career at Lafayette College.

Judge Bob ItoMaria is ex-
pected to rule tomorrow whether
the defense can have Dadio re- ,
veal her allegedly scarred knees '
to the jury.

The prosecution feels this will
create too much of a distraction
to the courtroom, but would like
to see them, anyway.

Help, I’m trapped in a living
hell. Will somebody help me!
This is the only message that I
can sneak out from this God-
awful place! The Phi is holding‘r
me prisoner!

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

APRIL 21, 1995

Faculty raises standards
for honor roll, Dean’s list

more people causing the lists to lose
their usefulness, said Sessions.

We’ve raised honor requirements
before. A few years back, the stan-
dards for graduating summa, magna,
and cum laude were raised,”
said Sessions.

Sessions believes some students will
be perturbed by the change. He said
they might see this as a move by the
faculty to take something away from
them. However, Sessions believes they
will not be right in thinking that. Hodges
believes students will understand the
need for the changes.

At Sessions’ request, University
Registrar Scott Dittman said he will
include explanations of the changes on
the back of official transcripts begin-
ning this summer. Sessions hopes to
ward off cosmetic problems for stu-
dents who had once been on the honor
lists and after the changes were not.

While the W&L faculty seems to be
in overwhelming support of the new
requirements, students have already
voiced opposition. Both student mem-
bers of the University’s Courses and

“I believe the students are going to
ﬂip,” said Sophomore Paul Saboe, one
member of the Courses and Degrees
Committee, “Raising the Honor Roll
requirements would put it beyond the
reach of most students.”

Saboe also believes students would
cease to strive to make the Honor Roll
because the standards are too rigorous.

“It used to be obtainable — some-
thing to shoot for — now it’s too de-
manding,” said Saboe.

Senior Brad Meier, also a member
of the Courses and Degrees Commit-
tee, agreed.

“I’ve been here four years and it’s
going to be hard to see my friends who
can’t meet the stricter standards let
down,” said Meier, “How can you ex-
plain to your parents why you don’t
make Dean’s List anymore?”

Before the current resolution was
passed, Saboe and Meier presented an
original plan which was defeated. it
called for raising the Dean’s List re-
quirement to 3.25 and leaving the Honor
Roll requirement at 3.5.

“The faculty simply did not take the

Degrees Committee opposed

student’s opinion into consideration,”
that resolution.

said Meier said.

a matter of debate

to decide these issues, says Howison; the only area in which students have
complete autonomy is the operation of the Honor system.“There is a tendency for
students to take autonomy and apply it to other organizations,” he said.

Senior Kelly Brotzman said students often fail to distinguish between au-
tonomy and self-govemance. Autonomy means that students make decisions
involving the university without any accountability to the faculty or administra-
tion. Self-govemance, on the other hand, means that the Board of Trustees
students power over certain areas, Brotzman said.

Howison cites the Student Activities Board, Student Conduct Committee,
Mock Convention and Fancy Dress as pockets of student autonomy in other
areas. The problem comes when something such as housing becomes an institu-
tional issue. Under the W&L by-laws, the faculty or the Board of Trustees must
intervene. He used coeducation as an example. When the faculty and the students
were butting heads over whether to allow women to attend W&L, and alumni
were threatening to stop contributing money to the school, students and alumni
argued that coeducation would destroy the school’s tradition, but the faculty and
the Board of Trustees voted for coeducation because they believed it would
beneﬁt the school, Howison said.

Waddy believes most students are aware of the faculty ’s and the administration ’s
authority to decide such matters. However, Waddy believes many students think
the administration is abusing its power and not paying any attention to their
opinions, “They have the legal authority, but they should think about what the
consequences will be in terms of student opinion.”

Brotzman said students should be consulted when the faculty or the Board of

Ukraine demands new power plant

On Monday, ofﬁcials in Kiev, Ukraine changed their position on the status
of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Last week, President Leonid Kuchma
told members of the European Union and the G-7 group of industrialized
nations that the plant would shut down its two remaining reactors by 2000.
He now has threatened to keep the aging plant, which supplies about 7% of
Ukraine’s energy, open unless Western countries agree to build a replace-
them plant.

Ando wins prize for architecture

On Sunday, an international panel of judges announced that Tadao Ando,
53, of Osaka Japan is the recipient of the 1995 Pritzker Architecture Prize.
Ando’s most recent distinction is that approximately 30 of the buildings
which he designed that were built in the Kobe, Japan area were not severely
damaged by the January 17th earthquake. Ando is a self-taught architect who
rattributes his skill to reading and studying trips to the United States and
Europe.

Ciller campaigns for support

Turkish prime minister, Tansu Ciller, began campaigning on Monday for
American support for the Turkish army ’s incursion into northern Iraq. 35,000
Turkish troops were sent into the U.S. patrolled zone to attack camps used by
Kurdish rebels.

Guatemalan plot targets Harbury

U.S. ofﬁcials received information on Monday about a possible threat
ragainst Jennifer Harbury. Harbury has been searching for information about
the 1992 disappearance of her husband, Guatemalan guerrilla leader Efrain
Bamaca Velasquez. The FBI claims that members of the Guatemalan military
may be plotting to assassinate Harbury. Guatemalan authorities have prom-
ised to punish those involved with the threat.

Explosion in Oklahoma City

Just after 9 a.m. on Wednesday, a nine-story Federal building in Okla-
homa City was destroyed by a car bomb containing about 1000 pounds of
explosives. The building housed the local branch ofﬁces of the Departments
of Agriculture, Defense, Health and Human Services, Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, and others. The building also housed a day care center on the
econd ﬂoor. FBI agents are searching for two white males who drove away
mm the scene in a brown pick-up truck prior to the explosion. There has been
peculation about an Islamic group being responsible for the blast. The
explosion damaged buildings in the surrounding area and was felt up to nine
miles away. At press time, people were reported to still be trapped inside the
tructure, and there were many oonﬂicting reports about the number of
casualties.

IRS sued

On Monday, the American Center for Law and Justice, a group founded
by W&L alumnus Pat Robertson, sued the [RS on behalf of the Church at
Pierce Creek in Vestal, New York. The church lost its tax-exempt status for
radvertising against President Clinton in the October 30, 1992 editions of The
Washington Times and USA Today. Plaintiffs claim that the IRS has unjustly
revoked the church’s status because of its political activities. The church said
Clinton supported abortion, homosexuality and condom distribution in
public schools.

Fire caused nearly $40,000 worth of damage to Saint Patrick’s Church on April 8.

Lexington church destroyed by fire

By KATHY MAYURNIK
Phi Staff Writer

Fire broke out at St. Patrick ’s Church
on Saturday, April 8, resulting in seri-
ous damages but no casualties
or injuries.

The church, located on Nelson
Street, suffered total damages estimated
around $40,000. Damage costs will be
covered by diocese insurance, ex-
plained Reverend Jay Biber.

The ﬁre broke out in the sacristy, a

room containing sacred vessels and
vestments. The list of destroyed items
includes altar boy vestments, candles,
sheet music, and flower pots. Except
for the palm branches, which remained
out of reach of the ﬁre, the ﬁre de-
stroyed “basically the items that are
needed to conduct a mass,” said Biber.

The cause of the ﬁre, meanwhile,
remains unknown by either state ofﬁ—
cials orthe local ﬁre department. “State
and local ofﬁcials conducted a full
investigation, and were supposed to
have reported a cause by this week,”
noted Biber, but no cause has

been released.

Along with the unknown cause,
there is also the unknown caller who
reported the ﬁre, to whom Biber is
“etemally grateful.” Biber thanked to
the caller (and to the Lexington Fire
Department) for saving the church from
serious damage in his Palm
Sunday sermon.

The firefighting operation itself
“went rathersmoothly,” Lexington Fire
Chief Kenneth Hall said. Entering
from the sanctuary instead of the rear,
the 15 Buena Vista and the 19 Lexing-
ton ﬁre ﬁghters drove the ﬁre out of the

building. They had the ﬁre under con-
trol within 15 minutes.

Due to the smoke damage, Palm
Sunday services were held in the
Lenfest Center. The overall damage
was not severe enough to keep the
parishioners from their place of wor-
ship forvery long, though, and services
at St. Patrick’scommenced the evening
of Palm Sunday.

Sunday night’s services were a bit
chilly, however, since four stained glass
windows had also been destroyed.
Plexiglass has been substituted until
the stained glass can be installed.

Self-defense
offered for
P.E. credit

By CINDY YOUNG
Phi News Editor

Every semester this year, the hands and feet of
more W&L women are becoming trained for effec-
tive self-defense— whether on campus or off.

Spring Term 1995 marks the third term a self-
defense course appears on some women ’s schedules.

Such as class comes to the W&L campus through
the cooperation of Women’s Forum, the Physical
Education Department, and W&L Security Director
Mike Young.

Shannon Stiltner, who teaches the class together
with fellow Security Ofﬁcer Melvin Davis, explains
that the course’s aim is to prepare women for self-
defense against rape offenders, should such an occa-
sion arise.

Girls leam the basic stance, and from there a
number of self-defense moves including how effec-
tively to kick, punch, and escape from choke holds.

“You don’t have to know anything,” Stiltner
stresses, in order to enroll in the class. “We take some
of the shyest people, and when the class is over, they
leave feeling much more conﬁdent in themselves.”

While the objective of the course is to teach
women defensive moves to practice against potential
rape offenders, such aggression is offered only as an
option.

“The class teaches how to ﬁght, but the choice
itself is left to the young lady,” Stiltner comments.
But if a graduate chooses to ﬁght, this class ensures
she will “know how to do so 100% right.”

The course has met with much enthusiasm. En-
rollment is limited to twelve women per section, and
Stiltner mentions a two page waiting list. In Fall
1995, the class will expand to two sections.

Bjornen duPont, one of 11 to complete the Winter
Term class, sums up its appeal: ‘‘I left feeling like I
could defend myse1f...plus it was a lot of fun!”

The course’s ﬁnal, far from involving blue books
or ink, casts Officer Davis as an offender whom the
girls must individually ﬁght off.

For this exercise, the students don helmet and
gloves, and leave the course with a certain conﬁ-
dence at their newfound ability to defend themselves.
Davis, meanwhile, dresses in a protective suit (with,
according to Stiltner, a few unfortunate gaps) and
risks leaving the exam not without a few black and
blue marks.

Overall, the self defense class is a helpful experi-
ence both for student and teacher. “Not only do the
girls leave having learned something,” Stiltner adds,
“but we do too.”

AUTONOMY from page 1

Trustees making a decision on big issues. She said the
administration failed to do that on the sophomore
housing requirement. The Board of Trustees didn’t
know what students thought of the requirement when
they voted on it, she said. '

Howison said he had three open forums to get
student opinion about the sophomore housing re-
quirement. He noted student opposition to the re-
quirement, but he said the plan would beneﬁt the
school. When it becomes a question of what is in the
best interests of the school, the administration and the
faculty must step in and do what they think is right, he
said.

Brotzman said the faculty and the Student Affairs
Committee are doing a much better job of getting
student opinions on Winter Rush. Still, students be-
lieve they’re powerless even when the administration
listens to their opinions,according to junior Lakeisha
Townes. She said in the sophomore housing require-
ment , students expressed their opposition, but the
Board of Trustees passed it anyway. Many students
believe their opinions don’t matter, she said.

“In general, we pride ourselves on student au-
tonomy at W&L, but it seems like when big decisions
[Winter Rush] come to the forefront, the power leaves
the students’ hands.”

English professor Edwin Craun remembers when
he was the newspaper editor at his alma mater, Wheaton
College in Illinois. He had a faculty advisor who
censored his editorials and columns. A faculty mem-
ber moved to deny Craun his degree because of his
editorials. The administration would never try that
with any of the school publications on this campus, he
said.“What always strikes me about the relationship
between the faculty, the administration and the stu-
dents is that student organizations have so much more
freedom from faculty supervision than anywhere else,”
Craun said.Because of the high level of student au-
tonomy on campus, students are shocked when the
faculty or the Board of Trustees exert their authority,
he said.

Brotzman agreed. Students become aware of the
distinctions between autonomy and self—govemance
when explosive issues such as Winter Rush pit the
students against the faculty, she said.

The debate about student autonomy is nothing
new. In 1915, the staff of the Calyx dedicated the
entire yearbook to criticizing the perceived tyranny of
the administration, said Sanders. The introduction
began this way: “Yes! the Good Old Days have passed
into oblivion and only the Odds and Ends are left,
pitiful reminders of a former glory.” He said the
yearbook included a poem called The Good Old Days,
which accused the faculty of threatening to abolish
“The Swing.”

Students, faculty and the administration were sup-
posed to share the responsibilities of governing the
school, Sanders said. Until the 1930’s, students served
on faculty committees. W&L’s strength lies in the
faculty and the students working together on these
issues, he said.

“It’s not an Us vs. Them issue,” he said. “None of
us are independent of each other.”

Religion professor Harlan Beckley agreed. He
said issues such as Winter Rush affect the entire W&L

community.“Whether there is Winter rush or not
affects more than just the fraternities.” He believed
that when issues such as these come along, students
should not be the only ones who decide on it. That
does not mean that students cannot offer their opin-
ions or that the faculty should dictate the fraternity
life, but it does mean that students aren’t the only
ones making decisions that affect the entire school,
he said.

The majority of the students opposed both the
sophomore housing requirement and Winter Rush,
said Waddy. He said the administration believes
they know better than the students.

“The Board of Trustees has the power to make
these decisions, but they should be held accountable
for the decisions they make.”

Sophomore Robert Taylor disagreed.

“You can’t just say we’re losing our autonomy,”
he said. “Each step that the faculty is taking should
be viewed individually and not taken as a whole.”

He agreed that in some instances, the students’
power has been overridden, but only for the beneﬁt
of the university. He said students still have plenty
of power. But in extreme cases when the school is
being hurt ﬁnancially, the administration has a re-
sponsibility to intervene and rectify the situation.

Executive Committee President Kevin Webb said
he understands the students’ concerns about au-
tonomy. During an open forum on the Honor System
at the Law School, two law professors stood up and
said that if students didn’t make changes in the
system, they would not support it. Webb said al-
though he doesn’t believe the professors’ statements
reﬂected the feelings of most faculty, he thinks they
should not make such comments about a student-run
system.

But he said the issue isn’t really about student
autonomy. Many students fear the administration is
trying to take away those things that make W&l.
unique, such as student freedom to make decisions,
and are more concerned with W&L making the list
for top American liberal arts schools in U.S. News
and World Report, Webb said. He thinks the contro-
versy over student autonomy is really a difference in
opinions about what direction the university is tak-
ing. The faculty believe they’re trying to improve
the school while some students believe the school is
fine the way it is, he said. Webb said students made
the same arguments in 1985 when coeducation was
the issue.

Howison said he doubts students knowing more
about the university by-laws would quiet the debate.
While a greater awareness is good, it is not going to
change students’ minds about Winter Rush or the
sophomore housing requirement, he said.

Webb agreed. The faculty and administration
have always had the power to decide these issues, he
said. The difference, according to Webb, is that
Winter Rush represents a major change in how the
fraternity system works, and the faculty and the
fraternities are split on the issue.

He said issues such as Winter Rush get students
upset because the faculty’s authority stands out
more.“Whenthe bi ggerissues come out, that’s when
you have cries of student autonomy.”

Law professor edits book of essays

Beyond the Blue Ridge is compiled by Bethany Bauman

From Phi staff reports

Andrew W. Thenia, Jr., profes-
sor of law at Washington and Lee, is
the editor of a collection of essays in
William Stringfellow, who was an
activist lawyer and widely read lay
theologian for 30 years. The collec-

tion is titled Radical Christian and Ex-
emplary Lawyer: Honoring William
Stringfellow. The collection captures
Stringfellow’s compelling legacy.
Some ofthe essays deal with recurring
themes in Stringfellow’s theology, in-
cluding the powers and principalities
and the apocalyptic; other pieces re-

count the experiences of colleagues
and friends. Still others in this eclectic
collection focus on the law and the
legal profession. The collection in-
cludes contributions from well-known
lawyers, theologians, and social activ-
ists, and it is a testimony to the impor-
tance of Stringfellow’s’ continued in-

fluence across a wide spectrum.

Thenia received his BA in geology
from W&L, and a master’s in the same
from Columbia. He received his law de-
gree from W&L in 1962, and then prac-
ticed law with the ﬁrm ofBoothe, Dudley,
Koontz, & Blankenship in Alexandria
before joining the W&L faculty in 1967,

ﬁeld. Besides free food, there well be additional free
activities for the students to participate in.

“I love the free snowcones, especially grape then

Many students are eagerly awaiting a chance to
participate in the carnival. Offering such activities as
the Moonwalk, Velcro Flytrap, and Sumo Wrestling
has peaked the student’s interest.

Cumutte and Maher will play again at the Pit on
Tuesday at 9:00.

Their ﬁrst album was Think Again. Their most
recent album is Rumble of the Ages. They cite Bob
Dylan, John Prine, and Paul Simon as major inﬂu-
ences on their music. The band has played Lincoln
Memorial University, Andrew College, Gordon Col-
lege, and other schools.

Cumutte is originally from West Virginia and
Maher hails from New Jersey. They met while at-
tending Wake Forest University. They now reside in
Nashville, Tennessee.

Maher majored in English while Cumutte ma-
jored in English and Philosophy. Although they have
not any formal musical training, they have taken
several private guitar lessons.

LET LOOSE

The carnival is sponsored by W&L Student Ac-

tivities Department, and the proceeds will beneﬁt the

local chapter of the American Cancer Society, and
the Outing Club willbesupporting efforts to preserve
the rainforest.

“This is the first year we are having an actual
carnival. In previous years, the dining hall has had an
outdoor barbecue with dunk tank. This year I helped
organize it into a larger event,” said Michelle
Richardson Student Activities Coordinator.

Some students are more interested in the varia-
tions in music that will be offered at the concert
tonight. Four different student bands will be per-
forming between 4 and 7 p.m.. Each is slated to play
for one hour. At 8 p.m. the much acclaimed W&L
natives Brian Boland, Tommy Esposito and Pat
White, collectively known as The Outsiders, will be

playing.

The six carnival booths will be manned by W&L
student organizations. The Minority Student Asso-
ciation, the International Club, Dorm Counselors,
Resident Advisors, Freshman Leadership Council
and the Campus Ministries are all donating time to
the carnival.

Alpha Phi Omega, the service fraternity will be
selling tickets for the booths. Tickets are two for one
dollar, and can be used for the carnival games such
as, milk can toss, star darts, basketball toss.

A surprise addition to the carnival is the fortune
telling booth. For most students, their only experi-
ence with fortune telling has been Hunan’s ‘special’
Chinese fortune cookie.

There will be an opportunity for many students to
revenge their most ‘hated’ professors. Many faculty
members will be participating in the Dunk Tank.

For just $10 many students jumped at the chance
to participate in the volleyball tournament. Pre-
registration was required, but teams may still check
with Richardson, or Matt O’ Brien for extra spaces in
the tournament.

In case of rain, the carnival will be held at the
Pavilion. Due to space limitations at the rain sight,
the volleyball tournament will be canceled.

autobiography
,explores life within a gang

By MICHAEL HEWLE’I'I‘
Phi Associate Editor

One day in my high school English class, a substitute teacher went into the
politics of color in gang culture. He talked about how wearing the wrong color
in the wrong place could put you in a hollow grave. A few years back I watched
a documentary about L.A. gangs. I have long forgotten the details, but one image
stands out in my mind: an 8-year-old girl who was shot because she waved. A
gang took her wave as a marker for another gang. That image burned into my
mind. Plenty of images burn into my mind as I read Monster: TheAutobiography
of an L.A. Gang Member by Sanyika Shakur, a.k.a. Monster Kody Scott.

In the introduction, he says, “I propose to open my mind as wide as possible
to allow my readers the first ever glimpse of South Central from my side of the
gun, street, fence, and wall.”

And open his mind he does. Scott joins the gang when he’s 11-years-old. He
doesn’t have much of a choice: Either join or die. To him, the gang represents his
family, the people who protect him. When he joins, the gang jumps him in. In
other words, they beat the living hell out of him and then bring him into the family.

Monster’s overridding ambition is to retain O.G. status (Original Gangster).
There are three steps to attain this status.

“1. You must build the reputation of your name, i.e., you as an individual;

2. You must build your name in association with your particular set, so that
your name is spoken of in the same breath, for it is synonymous; and
3. You must establish yourself as a promoter of Crip or Blood, depending,

The bottom line: Build your reputation to the point where people will think
twice before they mess with you. Scott does this with much relish. He puts a hole
in anyone who even looks at him funny, anyone from another gang, anyone who
messes with his gang. His conscience doesn’t bother him anymore. He kills
without thinking. He becomes Monster, known for committing acts of violence
that even shocks his own gangmembers. Being shot himself doesn’t stop him
from attaining his ambition. Going to prison only increases his reputation.

Yet, when he goes to prison, he begins to transform himself. He reads, turning
from a gangmember to a black nationalist. He renames himself Sanyika Shakur
and commits himself to ﬁghting the causes of gansterism.

Monster writes a disturbing book. He takes the reader into a world where
territories are set and being in the wrong neighborhood could get you killed. He
describes a place where a wrong word or a wrong color will put a bullet to your
head. A dangerous world, a world where right and wrong are not as important as
simply surviviving. He details the mind-bogglin g organization of these gangs and
how they have progressed to the place where it’s not Crips killing Bloods but
Crips killing Crips.

Reading the book will not make you necessarily love Monster. The violence
he committed revolted me. But he is honest, and his honesty gives the book its
credibility and its power. We complain about how boring Lexington is. We don’t
know how lucky we are.

Monster describes a place where violence is an everyday occurrence, a place
where 5-year-olds see dead bodies, a place where teen-agers start planning their
own funerals. He describes a nightmare where only survival matters. This is not
a comforting book. Readers will not close this book and peacefully fall to sleep.
The violence will shock you because its real. It’s graphic and presents a terrifying
portrait of gang life in South Central L.A. But it provides a rare inside view of

- of course, on which side of the color bar you live.”

what it is like to be in a gang.

HﬂVE SITESS?
HY E kayak

By RACHELLE ROWE
Phi Contributing Writer

Kevin Batteh first witnessed kayaking from the
same place most of us probably did : from that cool
guy on Sesame Street. But what he did after seeing
this was probably very different from us: he made
kayaking -a part of his life.

Batteh ﬁrst kayaked while at Boy Scout Camp at
age 12. There he learned the most basic but important
form of rescue for any serious kayaker, the “eskimo
roll.” This is when the boater maneuvers his kayak
to the upright position after it has been turned upside
down and saves himself from drowning.

Kayaking has played an active roll in Batteh’s life
ever since then. Three years ago he became certified
to teach kayaking through a class in North Carolina
and teaches classes for the Outing Club every spring
term. However, Batteh is a senior now so if you’ve
been interested in learning to kayak, this spring term
will probably be your last chance to learn from a pro.

Batteh has spent his last two summers making a
small proﬁt doing what he loves most. He spent the
summer of 1993 in Colorado video kayaking on the
Arkansas River, or becoming what ‘many call a
“vidiot.”

He made and commentated videos of people white
water rafting. First he would kayak ahead of the

white water rafters and ﬁnd a spot on the rocks that

. he could sit with his camera and use his English skills

commentating the adventures of the rafters. They
call these people “vidiots” because if they get in
trouble, they are all alone, and this of course is very
dangerous.

On his days off, Batteh would travel and test the
rocky rivers of Colorado. His most intense kayaking
experience was in Independence Pass on Lake Creek.
He describes it as “hairboating” or just a “hairy”
experience in that the rapids were quite intense. He
remembers his time in Colorado very fondly and
obviously had a really great time. “I was getting paid
to do something I love and Colorado is so incred-
ible!”

Batteh spent last summer kayaking in West Vir- I

ginia. He says his dream is to kayak the Grand
Canyon. In terms of difficulty, it isn’t any more
intense than anything he’s kayaked before, but it’s
every serious kayakers' dream. It takes about 2-3
weeks and there’s a waiting list for the permit.

Batteh manages to keep kayaking a major part of
his life while staying active here at W&L. As an
English major in pursuit of a law degree, he divided
his spare time between his position as former IFC
President, and his fraternity.

He considers Goshen Pass his “home river” since
he is most familiar with it from his years of school
here. He admits kayaking is a good stress reliever,
but concedes his love stems from its “adrenaline
rush.”

Farley, Spade
compensate for
Tommy Boy's
nonexistent plot

 

   

By KIRK SUSONG
Phi Movie Reviewer

Tommy Boy — tkﬁrl/2

It seems that the writers and producers of Saturday Night Live have caught
some sort of terrible disease. All of their scripts and creations fall into one of two
categories: they are eitherfantastically hilarious or embarrassingly desperate for
laughs (remember “Tiny Elvis”?).

Luckily, Tommy Boy falls mainly in the former. Brian Dennehy plays a
successful car parts manufacturerwho wants to bring his fun but none-too-bright
son Tommy (Chris Farley) into the company. But when his father dies unexpect-
edly, it is up to young Tommy to save the company, his fortune, and the jobs of
his employees.

This means he has to hit the road to sell thousands of new brake pads the
company has staked its future on. Going along with him is the smart-ass know-
it-all no one liked in high school, Richard Hayden (David Spade).

The ﬁlm is most successful when those two are dominating the screen. They
fonn a good duo reminiscent of the best two-somes of the past (Hope & Crosby,
Martin & Lewis, Burns & Allen, etc.). The writers provide them with plenty of
barbed witticisms, wise-cracks and put-downs to ﬂing at each other. For
example, when Farley asks if his jacket makes him look fat, Spade responds, “No.
Your head makes you look fat.”

David Spade has perfected the quick, muted, under-his-breath insult and the
indignant sarcastic reply, like his “Hollywood Minute” on SNL. As funny as
Spade is throughout the film, it is really Farley who comes into his own.

Although the ﬁlm is light in tone and subject matter, I was surprised to see
what a quality actor Farley could be. During the ﬁlm’s few sensitive moments,
it is amazing the range and depth of emotion Farley coaxes from the limiting
script.

Peter Segal (Naked Gun 33 1/3) directs with only the barest effort, staying out
of the way and letting the comedy do its own thing. Written by a cast of SNL
regulars (Bonnie & Terry Turner and Fred Wolfe), the script is truly hit-and-miss.
The good moments are easily laugh-out-loud funny, and the slow ones come so
infrequently it is easy for us to wait them out.

Don’t expect any exciting plotting or character developments — here every-
thing serves the rapport and tension between Farley and Spade. There are also
some distracting side-plots involving Bo Derek, Rob Lowe and a love interest for
Farley which could have easily been left out.

Nevertheless the ﬁlm is, on the whole, very funny. It is the sort of humor you
would expect from the SNL bunch, and hopefully we will see more ﬁlms from
the Farley/Spade duo in the future. I am not sure if Tommy Boy is worth going
out of yourjway to see. But let me put it this way: it is not as funny as Wayne ’s
World, but funnier than Wayne ’s World 2. .

The Rating Scale

t5t*13n’§r1’§r - Gobuy this as soon as it comes out on video. It is an instant classic. “You’ll
laugh; you’ll cry; and maybe, just maybe, you’ll learn something about yourself.”
rfnértir - Go see this ﬁlm now, while it’s still on the big screen. It’s worth a few Oscar
nominations and the seven bucks you’ll pay if you see it outside Lexington. Overall,
“Better than Cats!”

1&7} - Okay, so there have been better films. Nevertheless, it is a good example of its
genre, and you should probably see it on videotape. Still, probably “Better than
Cats!”

{fr - It happens to be on HBO, and you’re blowing off tomorrow’s reading. Although
your time would probably be better served on your education, its free and you’re
bored, so go ahead and watch it.

Q — Even if its free and your best friend said he never laughed harder, trust me,
this one sucks. Don’t waste your time, or at least don’t waste it on this. (There’s
always MTV.)

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

Great Expectations —— Too Great?

April 3 was a day of bitter irony. Most students were agonizing over

‘l the pressures of final examinations. We were pushed to the limits of

academic stress and pulled through. The faculty was busy that day as
well. They passed a resolution raising the Dean’s List requirement
from 3.0 to 3.4 and Honor Roll from 3.5 to 3.75.

We were struggling to achieve and win success, while they altered
the terms of that success.

Talk to any student and one will discover Washington and Lee is not
an easy school. There is no grade inﬂation. Students are not given a
free ride. Academic standards are rigorous.

Yes, over half of the student body makes Dean’s List. That’s
because they deserve to make the Dean’s List. It should be an
obtainable honor. With the newly imposed 3.4 requirement, many
students will lose the incentive to strive for the Dean’s List.

The faculty believes a certain exclusivity should accompany the
Dean’s List and Honor Roll. After all, what’s the purpose of a Dean’s
List in which 53 percent of students are members? The Ring-tum Phi
agrees — in part. Let us suggest a solution to the exclusivity issue.
Raise the Honor Roll requirement to 3.6. Allow the Honor R011 to be
the elite fraternity of intellectuals which the faculty deems so necessary.

The Dean’s List, however, should be left alone. When half of the
students earn the distinction to be named to the List, it is testament to
their tenacious efforts and hard work. Why deny them that victory?

Why ignore their achievements to glorify the few?

Rest, Reflect, Rethink...

Goshen, Monday night parties, laying out, Total Theatre, Zollman’s,
ultimate frisbee on the front lawn...these are the days of Spring Term.

Unlike the intense trials of Fall and Winter Tenns, Spring Term
allows students a chance to relax, reﬂect, and rethink.

A time to relax. Enjoy the relative ease of having only two classes
and take advantage of the slowed pace. Catch your breath and defeat,
at last, those winter doldmms.

A time to reﬂect. Look back on the previous seven months.
Recognize your successes and admit failures. Resolve to improve next
time.

A time to rethink. With the chaos passed, renew your enthusiasm
about Washington and Lee. This University is rich with honor,’
tradition, and excellence. Glance around — you’re amidst greatness.

Spring Term is not only glorious for its sun, music, and revelry, but
the opportunity it affords each student to re-establish his faith in this

institution.

Hello!

This issue of The Ring-tum Phi marks a beginning. It is the ﬁrst
issue of our new staff. We promise to deliver the campus news
promptly, accurately, and regularly. We will maintain a policy of
fairness, excellence, and quality. We are Washington and Lee’s 98-
year-old newspaper and look forward to serving in the grand tradition

of our predecessors.

‘Amherstization’ threatens university

 
 
   

A" ‘ NICHOLAS L.
WADDY, ’96

Two recent events, in my perhaps
not-so-humble opinion, should give all
true Washington and Lee gentlemen
(and ladies) genuine cause for alarm. I
am thinking, first of all, about the re-
cent decision to mandate that sopho-
mores live in University housing. Ob-
jections to this policy differ in their
rationale: some say the policy is unfair
to W&L women, some ‘that it is a
scarcely concealed attack on the frater-
nity system. In defense of its policy,
the administration contends that a
sophomore housing requirement will
help build a sense of community Uni-
versity-wide and will provide W&L
with needed funds. Whoever is right,
the fact remains that the policy is a
direct assault on the principle of stu-
dent self-govemment. And if the sopho-
more housing requirement does end up
developing a sense of solidarity among

. the students, one suspects that that ca-

maraderie will probably find its basis
more in a shared resentment of Big
Brother in Washington Hall than in
anything else.

A parallel case is the appointment of
a dean of student activities to supervise
what we optimistically label ‘fun’ at
Washington and Lee. Again, detractors

insist this move is just one more at-
tempt to reduce the power of fratemi-
ties at W&L.
The official justification, to be sure,
would be phrased quite differently-
the purpose of the student activities
dean, the administration might say, is
to give the social scene at W&La depth
it has never before had. With a ‘dean of
fun’ in place, it might be claimed,
students will have for the first time a
truly free choice about whether or not
they wish to affiliate themselves with
any Greek organization. Which argu-
ment one accepts,«pro or con, depends
largely on how one evaluates the work
our fraternities and sororities are doing
in meeting the social needs of the W&L
student body.
In any event, what is more distress-
ing about the Student Activities Coor-
dinator is not her feelings toward the
fraternities (whatever they maybe),
but her remarkably poor judgment and
highly questionable taste. The
University’s new social standards, ex-
empliﬁed by the recent talk, “Hot, Sexy,
and Safer,” are, in fact, an affront to
any civilized concept of decency and
decorum. l freely (indeed, proudly)
admit that I did not attend this “memo-
rable and entertaining lecture,” but ev-
erything l have heard seems to indicate
that, if such a thing as taste still exists,
Ms. Landolphi violates it.
lt is in many respects an insult to the
intelligence of the student body that
the University now believes we need
to be goaded by a dean in order to have
anappropriate level and variety of ‘fun,’

but it is even more distressing what
‘fun’ is now considered to be.

Getting to the heart of the matter, I
want to suggest the following: that all
planning for the future at Washington
and Lee is divided into two parts— two
paths, if you will, and we show every
sign of choosing the lesser of the two.

On the one hand, there are many
professors, administrators, alumni, and
even students who exalt the
pontiﬁcations of U.S. News & World
Report as the deﬁnitive standard on
which the success of our University
ought to be judged. By this line of
reasoning, Amherst and Williams are
the nearest thing to perfection that any
liberal arts college can hope to achieve,
and we ought to concentrate our efforts
on following their esteemed examples.
It is, in the ﬁnal analysis, more through
policy inertia than by conspiratorial
design that our University has drifted
slowly but inexorably in this lamen-
table direction, but, whatever the cause,
it should by now be obvious that the
“Amherstization” of W&L is an unde-
niable fact of life. Forcing students to
live on campus, restricting fraternities,
and promoting a social agenda disre-
spectful of traditional civilities, after
all, are policies entirely consistent
with the Amherst approach to Univer-
sity governance.

There is, however, a second ideal for
W&L, one inﬁnitely better suited to our
history and character, that of Robert E.

Lee. The University envisioned by Lee,
a community of pious and morally un-
impeachable scholars, united in a com-

mitment to honesty, integrity and

gentlemanly conduct, remains a laud-
able, if not entirely practicable goal.

Many administrators, for their part,

rightly condemn the rampant abuse of
alcohol at Washington and Lee. But
instead of doing as Lee would have
done—-instead of directly enforcing
whatever new regulations seem to be
required in order to purge our commu-

nity of such disreputable conduct—our
administrators insist on duplicitously
extending their control over such mor-
ally neutral questions aswhere the W&L
student body chooses to live. The truth
is, of course, that fraternities are offen-
sive to some left-leaning bureaucrats
for reasons other than simply their ten-

dency to promote the irresponsible use _

of alcohol; many members of the W&L
community also want to abolish frater-
nities in order to help exorcise any
lingering ghosts of gender distinctions
frorri our society, which is, it goes with-
out saying, far aﬁeld from the primary
purpose of a liberal arts college.

The crux of the issue is this: if our
University and its unique ethos are to
survive, then we, the students, must
demand of our administrators that they
lay bare the full implications of their
vision for W&L’s future (or lack
thereof). 1, for one, came here,’ and
forswore more typical liberal arts col-
leges, for a very good reason: W&L is
unique among American universities
for its high academic, cultural and ethi-
cal standards. If this uniqueness is to be
preserved, then now is the time to make
our voices heard.

Affirmative Action for ‘angry White males’

THE FAR MIDDLE
Alex Christensen

As a white male myself, and one who is fre-
quently angered by the hypocrisy and incompe-
tence, not to mention the widespread, outright venal-
ity of the interests which seem to be controlling
Washington these days, I hesitate to lampoon or
dismiss certain views just because someone calls
them the domain of “angry white males.”

But, to be honest, many of the defenses of these
views written by white males seem to be little more
than whining about the erosion of a system that has
made the government a proprietary defender of their
interests alone for most of our history. Some white
men in this country seem to be willing to violate the
first principles of our country in order to defend a
status quo that keeps them on top.

Witness Proposition 187 in California, Pete
Wilson's promotion of a constitutional amendment
excluding the children of illegal immigrants, born on
American soil, from citizenship (upon what other
basis does his own claim to American citizenship, or
anyone else's, rest? It's a modem Dred Scott provi-
sion) and widespread discontent about alleged re-
verse discrimination in the application of Affirma-
tive Action programs, despite study after study docu-
menting very little actual reverse discrimination
taking place.

Quite a bind. For instance, it would not take
anyone long to ﬁnd a white male on the Washington
and Lee campus, probably a C-school major, who
would fume about the injustice of judging people on
anything other than merit, then turn around and
defend the 60/40 male to female ratio this university
uses to “ease the transition” to co-education, but
which really has the effect of both promoting some
less qualiﬁed men in the admissions process and
unfairly denying opportunities to some more quali-
ﬂed women. The next time you hear this Affinnative
Action-bashing from a man on campus, consider the
fact that he may be here not because of his merit or
ability, but simply because the admissions process at -
W&L brings in less qualified students simply be-
cause of their gender.

The origin of Affirmative Action was never some

liberal conspiracy to promote unqualiﬁed people. To
make that argument is racist in itself: it assumes that
every time a minority person has been promoted over
a non-minority candidate, the non-minority candidate
has been more qualiﬁed.

It is also revealed as faulty by Justice Department
surveys which have shown that this kind of so-called
“reverse discrimination” has only occurred in about
1.5 percent of cases. Now let's all count on our ﬁngers
how many times real discrimination against minorities
has occurred. No one likes to talk about that. It cannot
even really be documented, because, unlike Affirma-
tive Action programs, it is insidious and originates in
hate and contempt rather than any motive of levelling
the playing ﬁeld in this
country—so no official
records can be kept.

Affirmative Action
was designed to open up

The next time you hear this

creaky and awkward, a leftover from the sixties and
the Johnson and Nixon administrations. But so was the
whole government, until Bill Clinton showed up. The
intervening administrations did not seem to have time

‘to actually run the government. Affirmative Action

has a proud history. It has accomplished what it was
designed to accomplish. Stack that up against the
Rural Electriﬁcation Administration, the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, or the Post Ofﬁce,
and you'll see that for a government program, it is the
equivalent of a Ferrari Testarossa transmission.
President Clinton is on- the right track with Afﬁr-
mative Action, as he has been with much of the federal
bureaucracy. Fewer people now work in the federal
government than at any
time since JFK was in
the White House. Pro-
cesses have been stream-
lined andwaste cut. all in

traditionally closed ﬁelds
to minority candidates. lt
has done so. It has had the
ancillary effect, also emi-
nently desirable, of help-
ing to create a larger black
middle class than has ever
existed before in this na-
tion. Why? Because mi-
nority candidates were
unqualiﬁed? On the con-

Affirmative Action-bashing
from a man on campus, con-
sider the fact that he may be
here not because of his merit
or ability, but simply because
the admissions process at
W&L brings in less qualiﬁed
students simply because of

extremely effective. sen-
sible ways. Now his ad-
ministration is running a
comprehensive reviewof
all federal Affirmative
Action programs, with
an eye towards elimi-
nating its more egre-
gious misapplications.
This is how government
should work.

trary, it is because minor-
ity candidates have been
able to develop their abili-
ties in careers for which
they would not have been considered before, and have
been able to demonstrate ability and competence once
that barrier was overcome.

However, l do understand criticisms of specific
applications that have resulted in unfair practices.
Hard quotas are especially pernicious. But the angry
white male does not understand that that is not what all
Affirmative Action programs are about. Minority out-
reach, integrating outlandishly discriminatory strong-
holds through the courts, promoting fair employment
practices and non-discrimination policies are also the
fruits of Afﬁrmative Action, and they protect the
interests of every American.

It is true that old-style Affirmative Action is a hit

their gender.”

As for the 60/40 ratio,
if you are for it, you
should certainly be for
Affirmative Action. Both
have promoted noble ends by encouraging real results
over individual "equality," as if such a thing has ever
or could ever really exist. I believe the ratio, while it
may exclude some qualified candidates, actually has
had very beneﬁcial effects: preserving the gender
balance in our little Shenandoah Valley college belt,
moving slowly to promote an orderly progression
from all-male to co-ed, and producing truly outstand-
ing female alumnae who have been a credit to the
reputation and legacy of Washington and Lee.

But, like Affirmative Action, the gender ratio, 1

' believe, has become creaky and outdated. It is prob-

ably due for a Clinton-style bureaucracy-busting,
mindset-challenging overhaul. -

 

 

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, April 21, 1995 Y

Spring room-cleaning year in making

D REAM LAND
Richard Weaver

l’ve been meaning all year to clean
my room, and I ﬁgured that spring
term, with only two classes, was a
really good time to start.

It’s not as if my room started off
messy at the beginning of the year; in
fact, I’ve been very organized. I put
everything in separate piles based ei-
ther on subject matter, date, or if it’s the
same color as other things in the pile.
The problem arises when the piles over-
ﬂow or when you run out of ﬂoor space
and start having to store things in the
bathroom (or in the Phi ofﬁce).

I decided it was time to go through
the piles and make more compact piles
out of them. As I was sorting, I found
some interesting things, like several
boxes of World’s Skin Critters Tattoo
and Candy, which I bought at a dollar
store in Florida. Each box contains
about 20 pieces of gum shaped like
cigarettes, as well as several dragon
tattoos. As a college student in per-
petual search for food and entertain-
ment, this was a two—fer. No more
empty Friday nights.

I also came across something I
bought in an extreme fit of boredom:
Totally Uninhibited: TheLife and Wild

Times of Cher by Lawrence J. Quirk,
the shallowest book I have ever read.
You may also recall that Quirk wrote
Fasten Your Seat Belts: The Passion-

There was a
great picture of

used the fire truck that Washington and

You can’t beat finding old mail in
your room, either. I came across a

picture mailed to the Phi office of Miss
Teen All American, SreeRatna
Kancherla. It used to hang on my wall.
Judging by the number of pictures of
Miss Teen All Americans sent to the
Phi office, their term of ofﬁce must be
around 3 weeks. I also have a letter
from the National Library of Poetry
asking me to submit a poem for publi-
cation in their new book. I’m not sure
what my poem will be about, but it will
deﬁnitely have several gratuitous ref-
erences to SreeRatna Kancherla. I’m
submitting her picture with my
poem, also.

Clothes are also a special find in my
room. I came across several shirts that
I last recall wearing while I was in high
school. I think my mother may have
planted them in my apartment during
Parents’ Weekend. lt’s always inter-
esting to pick up a crumbled T-shirt,
see a stain on it, and try to remember its
history (Example: “When was the last
time I had fondue?”). My hint for orga-
nizing questionable clothing: use it to
add padding to your bed.

My room is nearing completion
now, but like a poem, that’s up for
interpretation. As I tell visitors, “This
is my room; it’s not a museum, I just
live there.”

Hey, if I can only think of some-
thing that rhymes with that, SreeRatna
and I will be famous.

Use of emblem does not indicate Amnesty support of cause

\

To the editor:

Recently, an organization called the
Shenandoah Valley Leonard Peltier
Support has posted signs around cam-
pus with the label “Leonard Peltier

Update” that have Amnesty
lnternational’s name and two of our
emblems on them.

This design was taken directly from
one of our posters without our permis-
sion, and the organization is using the

name “Amnesty lntemational” with-
out the permission of our chapter or
that of the national organization.

The Washington and Lee chapter of
Amnesty Intemational_ has never had
any connection with this organization,

and it has never sponsored any activi-
ties on behalf of Leonard Peltier.
Prisoners of conscience are
onsidered to be people who are impris-
oned simply for expressing their politi-
cal or religious beliefs in a non-

violent manner.

Although one of the main goals of
Amnesty International is freeing pris-
oners of conscience, Leonard Peltier
has been convicted of murder, and he is
not considered to be a prisoner of con-

science by Amnesty lntemational.

Dean Howison’s perspective on student governance 

To the editor:

Over the past few weeks, many students have asked me
about student governance and autonomy at Washington and
Lee. It is in important and pertinent question.

The role of students in the governance of Washington
and Lee is complex and unique in American higher educa-
tion. The most prominent aspect of the governance system
is the Executive Committee's administration of the Honor
System—an example of pure student autonomy. By the
authority of the Board of Trustees, the Honor System is
exclusively run by students. The University administration
and faculty have no authority over the system. However, all
other areas of student governance, including discipline and
supervision of student organizations, rest with the faculty as
delegated by the Board of Trustees in the by-laws
of the University.

Leadership lacking on winter rush issue

human being with some valid concerns about changing rush.
So what would I advise the IFC and my fellow students to do? How about

To the editor:

In the everyday life of the University community, this
system works well. The Executive Committee manages the
Honor System and in the other areas of student life, students
elect officers, appoint students to committees, allocate funds
to student organizations, adjudicate disciplinary matters,
supervise the dormitories and residence halls, and run Fancy
Dress and Mock Convention and the intramural program-
all with little or no administrative or faculty intervention. It
is when an issue arises that has broad implications for the
entire University that this system of governance is tested.
The most dramatic example in recent years is coeducation.

Although I was not at Washington and Lee in the mid-
1980's when coeducation was being debated, I know that
there was strong student opposition. The alumni were over-
whelmingly opposed. Nevertheless, the University admin-
istration and the faculty concluded that coeducation ws in
the best interests of Washington and Lee and the issue was

sent to the Board of Trustees. The Board approved coeduca-
tion in 1984 and we see the results of that decision all
around us.

Today, the issue that challenges our system of gover-
nance is fraternity rush. This is not a new issue. For over 20
years,the University administration, faculty and students
have debated the nature of the freshman experience at
Washington and Lee, and the impact that a fall fraternity
rush has on that experience. The Institutional Long Range
Plan of 1989 and te more recent Coeducation Review
Committee Final Report both recommended winter rush for
fraternities. The Interfratemity Council and the overwhelm-
ing majority of fraternity members have consistently op-
posed winter rush.

Since approving the existing delayed pledgeship pro-
gram in 1987, the faculty has maintained a discreet distance
from the supervision and management of the system. Some

a

modifications in certain aspects of the program have been”
made but the overall format of fall rush followed by delayed'
pledgeship with initiation in March has remained in place.‘
Now, as indicated by its 83-3 vote in favor of winter rush, the‘
faculty has forced the issue by raising an important questionfrz
Is the present fall fraternity rush system in the best interests
of Washington and Lee? *
As we work to answer that question, it is important to.
understand the evolutionary process that brought us to this
point, including the delicate balance between student au-
tonomy, faculty prerogatives and administrative responsi-
bilities. I am confident that we have the resources to make.
the right decision. Our system of governance is strong. It has;
served Washington and Lee well in the past and it will;
serve us well in the years to come. ‘

David L. Howison, Dean of Students

Is it just me, or does this whole winter rush debate seem a bit strange? I mean,
I thought fall rush was important to students. If that’s true, why do we have an IFC
that has shown an appalling lack of leadership from day one of this debate? Why
do we have an IFC president resigned to the faculty's dogmatic decision? This
issue highlights W&L’s lack of any real student government brilliantly.

I also thought that the students and their viewpoints were important to the
University. If fall rush is as bad as the faculty says, why don’t more students want
to change it? I think the vast majority of students would agree that the faculty has
not really tried to hear student opinion on this matter and hasn’t listened too well
or cared too much when it did. It also strikes me that Professor Williams should
be brought before the EC for saying that he does not know anyone who wants to
get rid of fraternities. Respectfully, members of the faculty and administration,
this attitude does not fool anyone as to your real desires and intentions. And lest
you all say that students have not been forthcoming with reasons against this
change, let me ask you why that might be. Could it be that students are afraid of
angering their dogmatic elders by disagreeing openly? Call me crazy, but I

thought when I paid $20,000+ to a school, I could get-a little respect-zas a thinking

sticking to your guns and stating the arguments against the winter rush monstros-
ity loudly and proudly? How about contacting alumni to let them know exactly
what is being done to the students so that they can register their disapproval on
Alumni Weekend? How-about asking alumni brothers to cease donations until
fall rush is kept? How about mass student walkouts, or asking each fraternity
member to forget to pay his fall tuition bill?

The whole idea of reforming higher education is based on the utter disregard
for the university’s customers that the Washington and Lee faculty and admin-
istration is now showing.

Now lest some of you say this is a little drastic, I ask you what the alternatives
are. Rational debate could continue into the twenty-first century without chang-
ing faculty minds. The founding fathers of our country, including George
Washington, recognized the power of the purse and public opinion, and it’s a
shame the IFC doesn’t share that vision. I thought that when you had a principle,
you fought for it. Meek and silent submission rarely wins change or respect.

At the conclusionof each competition, points are awarded

 

 

Sigma Chi’s Derby Days kicked off on Monday with the
band Leftover Salmon at Zollman’s will conclude this
Saturday, April 22, with the crowning of this year’s Derby
King and Queen.

The third annual Derby Days, sponsored by Sigma Chi,
brings fun and games to the first week of Spring Term 1995.

“The main goal of Derby Days,” according to Sigma
Chi’s program, “is fundraising for charity.” Among other
local charities to benefit from the event’s winnings, Special
Olympics is the main cause for which the event raises
money.

In the spirit of fundraising and good times, Derby Days
offers the four sororities on campus the opportunity to

according to each sorority’s ﬁnishing position.

Tuesday brought a touch football match similar to intra-
mural football. The championship, which was played above
the law fields, concluded with the victory of Kappa Alpha
Theta.

The Banner Contest on Wednesday, along with the
scavenger hunt on Thursday, offered more opportunities for
the sororities to compete with each other.

Friday ’s Crack-Ups, a new event for Derby Days, awards
points to sisters who “can make a Sigma Chi laugh in any
fashion” deemed by another sister “suitable.”

Derby Days concludes Saturday with Field Day, which
will take place at Zollman’s at 2:00 p.m. Events scheduled
for Field Day include a 5-legged race, a sack race, tug-of-
war, volleyball matches, and a wheelbarrow race.

It’s not only the sorority with the most points who will
emerge from Derby Days a winner, however.

Sigma Chi has pledged five percent of all money raised
throughout the event to Special Olympics of Rockbridge,
Allegheny, and Bath Counties. The remaining amount will
be divided among the sororities, with 20 percent going to the
sorority that earns the most points, 15 percent for the second
place sorority, 10 percent for the third, and five percent for
the fourth.

In addition to Greek fundraising activities during Derby
Days, Domino’s Pizza has promised to donate 7.5 percent of
all pizza sales during the week to local charities.

Derby Days offers campus sororities the opportunity for
friendly competition, with local charities beneﬁting in the
meantime.

TAFEL, from page 1

was noncommittal on the subject of gay
rights. Instead of giving up on the Republican
candidate, Tafel arranged a meeting with can-
didate Weld to discuss items of concern to
Massachusetts’s gay community. Following
these discussions, Weld admitted that he had
not taken a strong stand on these issues only
because he had not thought about them in any
detail before. Weld took strong stands for gay
and lesbian rights, education and support for
gay teens, and other issues of concern, and is
now considered “the most progressive gover-
nor in the country on gay issues,” according to
Tafel.

Following Weld’s election, Tafel was named
director of the state’s Adolescent Health Pro-

gram, where he helped to develop_nationally
recognized support programs for gay and les-
bian teenagers in Massachusetts’s schools.

Similar efforts have been made to alert and
educate Republicans about gay and lesbian
rights issues by the Log Cabin Republicans,
Tafel’s group, notably with such gay-friendly
Republican politicians as New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan, and New Jersey Governor Christine
Todd Whitman.

Now Tafel is a critical link in lobbying the
103rd Congress, the first Republican Congress
in 40 years. Traditional lobby groups such as
the Human Rights Campaign Fund and the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force have
found themselves limited in their access to
Republican politicians because of a perceived

tendency to ignore or demonize Republicans
and concentrate their efforts on Democratic
lawmakers, who used to control legislation and
the balance of power on Capitol Hill.

Tafel describes the Log Cabin Republicans
as performing a “mediating role” between the
gay community and the Republican lawmakers
now in power. For instance, while many lobby
groups were pessimistic about the chances for
the renewal of the Ryan White Care Act, which
provides AIDS funding, Tafel’s group lobbied
the chairpersons of the relevant committees in
each house, resulting in the renewal of the Ryan
White Act being made the first priority of each
committee. Tafel was also invited to testify
before Congress on the Act.

Tafel feels that the gay community’s ten-
dency to put all of their political eggs in one

(Democratic) basket has resulted in a
marginalization of gay activists in politics.
Democrats take their support for granted, while
Republicans do not appeal to the gay commu-
nity because they feel it is a vote that cannot be
won. Tafel contends however, that Democrats
such as Bill Clinton have turned their backs on
gay and lesbian issues once in office, while
Republicans such as Riordan, Weld, Giuliani
and Whitman have reaped substantial political
benefits from courting this crucial swing bloc
and taking their issues seriously, benefits not
just measured in voting, but in campaign sup-
port and fund-raising.

In 1994, studies showed 1 in 3 gay or lesbian
voters voted Republican. In fact, the Republi-
can “Contract with America” was designed,
according to Tafel, speciﬁcally not to exclude

gay and lesbians who might be attracted to the
conservative message of deregulation, smaller
government and government accountability.

Tafel said the key is for gay and lesbian
Republicans to take a stand in their own party,
one he says was founded on the basis of less
government interference in people ’s lives. Tafel
pointed out that the only reason the religious
right has had so much inﬂuence on the Repub-
lican party is because they just plain showed up
at local meetings and made their presence known
in Republican primaries.

He said that even a relatively small gay
organization like his has been able to have an
impact as well by making its presence known at
the grass-roots.

“I know I give them a headache. But we’re
not going anywhere,” said Tafel.

Two months before ofﬁcially
taking over his new job, new
head basketball coach Kevin
Moore has lofty expectations for
his Generals.

Moore was named the
program’s 20th coach April 4
by W&L athletic director Mike
Walsh.

The department’s search in-
cluded over 180 applicants.
“[Moore] has a unique blend
of enthusiasm, successful head
coaching experience and com-
mitment to Division III athlet-
ics,” Walsh said. “We are
pleased to name him as our new
coach and look forward to re-
establishing our competitive-

The Washington and Lee
women’s tennis team continued
to showcase its considerable tal-
ent over the break, as it prepared
for the ODAC championships
this weekend. The Generals
posted a 6-0 record for the past
two weeks, raising their overall
mark to a phenomenal 18-1.
The Generals began by de-
feating top-ranked Williams, 7-
2. W&L took a 2-1 lead after the
doubles matches, and then se-
nior No.1 singles player Marilyn
Baker set an example for the rest
of the match with her 6-2, 6-2
win.

Home field and the number-
one seed is the reward bestowed
upon the women’s lacrosse after
defeating national #7 Roanoke
College, 11-10, Wednesday.

The victory gave W&L the
regular season Old Dominion
Athletic Conference champion-
ship for the second time in three
seasons. The Generals won the
tournament crown in 1992 and
’93.

Asregularseason champions,
W&L earns the right to host the
toumament’s semiﬁnals and
championship game, scheduled
for next Friday and Saturday at
the Liberty Hall Fields.

“It was something we hoped
for,” said senior tri-captain
-Nicole Ripken. “We seem to play
better at home.”

“Better” is deﬁned as a 41-13
record since beginning play on
the Liberty Hall Fields in 1989,
including 4-1 this year.

“I think it gives us a bit of an
advantage,” said head coach Jan
Hathom. “It’s anybody’s tour-
nament, but this takes the edge
off a little.”

W&L (8-4, 6-1 ODAC) beat
Roanoke for the fourth time in
five meetings.

All four wins have been one-
goal margins, something the
players would like to start doing
without.

“It’d be nice to have an
occassional cusion,” said Ripken.
“It gets nerve-wracking, but it is
a great rivalry.”

The Maroons look to pick up
the toumament’s second seed
when they face Randolph-Ma-
con on Saturday, a likely semiﬁ-
nal preview. Lynchburg, the lone
ODAC team to defeat the Gener-

als, will be fourth.

W&L jumped out to an early
4-2 lead at Roanoke, but their
rivals stormed back to take the
lead.

The Generals managed to not
panic and fought back for a 9-7
lead at halftime.

ness within the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference.”

I think it’s an attainable goal,”
he said. “There’s quite a bit of
talent already there.”

Sophomore Chris Couzen, one
of several returning Generals who
met with Moore following the an-
nouncement, seems to agree.

“I’m taking it one step at a
time, but I think it’s a realistic
goal,” said Couzen.

Moore will also become Wash-
ington & Lee’s new head golf
coach, a job he held during his
ﬁrst two years at Elmira.

However, the key factor in
Moore’s move to Lexington was
the availability of the basketball
position.

In explaining his desire for the

job, Moore recalled his team’s
visit to W&L to face the Generals

the Nos.3-6 singles matches,
thanks to senior Cathy Gartin,
sophomore Anna O’Connor, and
freshmen Beny Blankinship and
Ericka Shapard.

Baker’s win was her twentieth
of the season and tenth straight,
earning her Athlete of the
Weekhonors, as well as her un-
precedented fourth consecutive
20-win season. No other W&L
player has accomplished this feat
more than once.

Next, the Generals travelled to
Hilton Head, where they made
mincemeat of their competitors,
St.Mary’s (Minn.) and Davis &
Elkins, by identical 9-0
whitewashings.

Last Friday, the Generals trav-
elled to Emory, the #1 ranked team
in the South. This was a chance
for the team to avenge last year’s

Women's lax
finishes strong

“We never lost our compo-
sure,” Ripken said.

Seniortri-captain and defender
Carrie Niederer agreed.

“This year we’ve been better
about staying in games when we
fall behind,” she said. “I think we
got more angry than panicked.”

Senior Lindsay Coleman net-
ted her 110th career goal five min-
utes into the second half for a 10-
7 W&L lead.

The score tied Coleman with
Angie Carrington ’94 for third
place on the school’s all-time goals
list.

The Maroons managed to close
within a goal twice the rest of the
way, but freshman Mary Jo
Mahoney’s free-position goal with
11 minutes left proved the differ-
ence.

Sophomore goalie Brooke
Glenn stopped 16 shots. W&L’s
Athlete of the Week is just nine
saves shy of the school’s single-
season record of 169.

Earlier this week, Glenn
stopped a school-record 27 shots
in a 18-6 loss to national runner-
up William Smith.

Ripken led the way with four
goals and one assist. She trails
Coleman with 107 career goals
and is now second in career assists
with 35.

Sophomore Erika Snyder had
two goals and one assist, while
junior Cheryl Taurassi also scored
twice.

Senior Meredith Long had
W&L’s other goal in the win.

The Generals’ victory was un-
doubtedly sweet,considen'ngtheir
rough 15-8 loss last season to the

Maroons on the Liberty Hall
Fields. _

In that early season meeting,
Roanoke came, saw, and kicked
grass in the face of the Generals’
hopes for a third straight ODAC
championship.

On Saturday, the Generals host
Frostburg at 2:00 in their ﬁnal
regular season game.

Last year, W&Lbeat Frostburg
for the ﬁrst time ever, 9-8.

“They’re always athletic,”
Hathom said of Frostburg. “Hope-
fully, our team won’t consider the
season over and will come ready
to fight.."

during the 1988-89 season.

“When I got back to Elmira, I
told my wife if [the W&L] job
ever opened up, I wanted it,” he
said.

The SUNY-Brockport gradu-
ate brings 122 career wins to his
new home.

The season before he took
over, the Soaring Eagles won just
seven games.

During his tenure at Elmira, a
Division III independent,
Moore’s teams took ﬁve trips
intopostseason tournaments, four
times to the ECAC, and a bid last
year to the NCAA Division III
tournament.

In his ﬁnal four seasons, they
averaged 18 wins.

In 1994, they brought home
the ECAC Upstate New York
championship in a 21-7 season.

heartbreaking 5-4 NCAA loss to
Emory. The team took advan-
tage of the opportunity as the
scales tipped ever so slightly in
W&L’s direction,reversing the
direction of the previous 5-4 score
for a Generals win.

'_The Generals again achieved
an early 2-1 lead after doubles, as
the 2nd doubles team of Shapard
and O’Connor won, 8-2, and the
3rd doubles tandem of junior
Julie Ayers and Blankinship won,
8-3. In singles play, W&L picked
up the three clinching wins from
freshman 2nd singles player
Natalia Garcia (6-4, 7-5), Shapard
at 4th singles (6-2, 7-5), and
O’Connor at 5th (6-3, 6-0).

Just a day after this emotional
win, which virtually assured
W&L of a return berth in this
year’s NCAA tourney, the Gen-

Moore named new basketball coach

Couzen is already impressed
with his new coach.

“He seems like a player’s
coach to me,” he said, “like the
kind of guy who enjoys what
hedoes and also wants to be close
to his players.”

When Moore made that 1989
trip to W&L, he was highly im-
pressed with the area and the
people, citing the quality of the
school as a factor in his pursuance
of the job.

Moore is returning to Lexing-
ton this weekend with his family
and expects to move into the area
after completing his duties at
Elmira in mid-June.

Moore and his wife, Shari,

says are already excited about
the move. He will ofﬁcially be-
gin his duties at W&L on July 1.

Freshmen Garcia and Shapard

The W&L’s men’s lacrosse
team, currently ranked sixth,
faced two other ranked teams
last week. The Generals knocked
off previously undefeated
St.Mary’s on the road April 12,
but were upset at home last Sat-
urday to Franklin and Marshall.

The Generals squeaked past
14th ranked St.Mary’s, 13-12,
thanks to timely goal scoring and
tough second half defense.

Senior attackman Andy
Dutton had a huge afternoon.
Dutton found the net four times
in the game, and he hit the game-
winner with close to nine min-
utes remaining in the contest.
Junior Ande Jenkins also had a
big offensive day, scoring four
times. '

Defense was also a big factor
in the victory. W&L shut down
the Seahawks’ offense for the
ﬁnal twenty-one minutes. Sopho-
more keeper Chris Testrake made

four key saves down the stretch
to preserve the win.

If statistics won games, the
Generals would have had no )-
trouble with Franklin and
Marshall. On paper, W&L won
27 of 28 face-offs, and took 14
more shots on goal. But on the (
ﬁeld, the Generals fell to the Dip— ‘
lomats by a final score of 14-11.

F&M connected on all of its
shots in the ﬁrst half and headed
into the locker room with a 10-3
lead. The Generals pulled the
game closer in the second half,‘ih
but could not fully recover.

Freshman goalkeeper Scott
Jackson was called OI.‘ in the sec-
ond half, and he played solid,
stopping nine of fourteen shots.
Ande Jenkins had another suc-
cessful day on offense, scoring
three goals and assisting on an-
other. Junior Adam Butterworth,
senior Ty Tydings had a goal and
a pair of assists. 7‘

W&L will look to get back on
the winning track at home this
Saturday. They will face
Denison, currently ranked 12th.

Graduation looms, many seniors remain jobless

By MICHAEL HEWLEIT
Phi Associate Editor

With graduation only a month away,
some seniors are still uncertain about
what they are going to do once they
receive their diploma.

Biology major Lucy Cavett is still
waiting for job offers. She sought
mostly teaching jobs at private middle
and high schools.

“It’s fun to go on interviews and
learn things, but it’s hard,” she said.
“It’s hard not knowing what they’re
looking for and convincing them that
you’re good for the job.”

It’s also hard convincing yourself
that you’re good for the job, she added.

It is not unusual for seniors to be
jobless on graduation day, explained
Career and Development Office Di-
rector Beverly Lorig. Only 35 percent
of last year’s senior class had a job by
graduation, but the percentage of se-
niors acquiring jobs increased to 68.7

Mr. W&L:

percent after seniors left Lexington,
explained Long.

“The person who doesn’t have a job
often feels like they’re the only one,”
she said. “The majority of students
who graduate will not be employed.”

But not to worry. Lorig said she has
heard from seniors who have
found jobs.

Business Administration major
Elise Brown got a job as a financial
analyst for Bowles, Holoowell, Conner
in Charlotte, North Carolina. She got
the job before Fancy Dress. Brown
said she’ll help with mergers and ac-
quisitions of small companies. It wasn’t
easy though. She had between 15 and
20 interviews before she received a job
offer, she said.

Computer Science major Robert
Powell sent out four resumes before he
got a job with Anderson Consulting in
Washington, D.C. He competed forthe
Anderson job with 12 other students
and was granted a second interview in
Washington, D.C. He received the job

offer on March 10. He said he was
relieved to have a job because it’s one
less thing he has to worry about. “It’s
especially nice [to have a job] because
it seems a lot of people don’t know
what they’re doing after they gradu-
ate,” said Powell‘.

Finding a job is not easy, said Lorig.
Although the job market is better than
it was two years ago, students will still
have to work hard to find a job. Nation-
ally, more graduating seniors are tak-
ing longer to find a job, and many will
end up taking temporary jobs. That is
why seniors need to visit CDP for help
with their job searching techniques,
she said. CDP will stay open all year
round to help those seniors who have
not found a job after graduation.

Lorig said a new database has been
created with students’ names and ca-
reer interests. The database will act as
a referral system for seniors who sub-
mit resumes and will respond to em-
ployers who suddenly have vacancies,
Lori g said.

Still, the job search will pose a chal-
lenge to seniors, she said.

History and Computer Science ma-
jor Laura Purcell agreed. “lt’s easy to
get wrapped up in what’s going on at
W&L and put stuff of ,” said Purcell.

The most difficult part is starting
the job search. She said she is keeping
her job options open.

“I know that I’m young, and I have
the rest of my life to find that dream
job,” Purcell said.

Currently, she is looking for jobs in
museums and computer science, and
CDP has helped her with resumes, job
interviews and graduate school.

Lori g encouraged all seniors to come
to CDP if they needed help in their job
search. She added that job prospects
look optimistic. “We’re at the point
where we’re hearing a lot of good
news,” said Lorig. Whether seniors
find a job or not depends on the amount
of energy they put into the search.

‘‘I think a job search is what you
make it,” said Lorig.

Kemp

APRIL 28, 1995

calls

for reform
at Kick-off

By DAN ODENWALD
Phi Executive Editor

Jack Kemp officially opened the
season of Republican presidential poli-
tics at Washington and Lee by de-
manding reform at the 1996 Mock
Convention’s Spring Kickoff
Tuesday morning.

Kemp spoke in front of Lee Chapel
to a crowd of enthusiastic supporters
waving posters and applauding vigor-
ously. His speech touched on popular
Republican tenets ranging from wel-
fare reform to support for the flat tax.

Kemp believes the Republican vic-
tories in the congressional elections of
1994 ushered in a revolutionary period
of time ideal for carrying out changes
in America.

This revolution and a GOP victory
in 1996 will bring about many needed
reforms in institutions such as welfare,
taxes, and education, said Kemp.

Regarding welfare reform, the
former Housing and Urban Develop-
ment secretary advocates ownership of
low-income housing as a way to lift the
poor out of poverty.

“This is what America is all about
-— to give people a chance to own
something and pass it on to their chil-
dren,” Kemp said.

He cited Marie Johnson as an ex-
ample. While in Pensacola, Florida
last year he assisted Habitat for Hu-
manity in building her a house. The
house was completed in less than 7
hours and gave Johnson, a single mother
with two children, something to call
her own.

“Once people own something they
will treat it differently than if they
didn’t own it,” explained Kemp.

Kemp believes all public housing
should be owned by the poor, and he
strongly advocated this idea while he

through a mixture of public and
private funding.

Kemp used his speech to give a
lengthy endorsement for a fairer
tax code.

“Our tax system is a national dis-
grace,” said Kemp, “We need it to be
ﬂat and fair. /You should be able to fill
it out on a postcard.”

He reprimanded those who would
characterize the capital gains tax cut as
a measure to favor the wealthy.

“What a stupid debate,”
exclaimed Kemp.

The former secretary denounced the
capital gains tax for its harmful effects
on anyone who seeks to increase
their income.

To cut the capital gains tax is to
promote investment and enterprise thus
improving the lots of more Americans,

said Kemp.

Kemp announced his support for
another Republican reform — the
flat tax.

Although he would not settle on the
specific percentage, he believed that
the ﬂat tax, exempting incomes below
$36,000, would be fairer and make tax
shelters and breaks less appealing to
overburdened taxpayers.

In the true spirit of any Republican
National Convention, Kemp used his
speed to bash the Democrats for irre-
sponsible government and promoting
class warfare.

“The American Dream is not based
on redistribution of wealth, but on the
principle that anyone can raise to the
highest of their ability,” said Kemp.

Kemp chastised President Clinton
for adopting a policy )f soaking the
rich. He promised that if a Republican
was elected President, “America would
once again lead the world in
equal opportunity.”

crats have strayed from the noble ef-

Kemp referred to a welfare mother
who faced a prison sentence for
saving $3,000 for her daughter’s
college tuition.

Apparently, the woman violated a
provision of the Aid to Family with
Dependent Children program by sav-
ing the money.

Kemp finds fault with a welfare
system that doesn’t allow Americans
to save.

“We must change the system,”
Kemp said, “Welfare must support the
traditional family.”

In a question addressed to Kemp
after the news conference, he defined a
traditional family as a household con-
sisting of a mother and father.

“Not to be disrespectful of single
mothers or fathers, but no civilization
has existed without the support of the
traditional family,” said Kemp.

Kemp also urged that all needy stu-
dents be granted the opportunity for a
higher education.

“No child in America should be
denied an education for lack of money,”
said Kemp.

He assured the audience that the
Republican party will actively pursue
financing education for the poor

clearly outline
the principles for which they stand.

“The challenge is... not to tell the
world what we’re opposed to,” said
Kemp, “The question isn't what we’re
against, but what we’re for.”

Kemp expressed the need for every-
one to work with together and partici-
pate in light of the recent Oklahoma
City Federal Building bombing.“The
events in Oklahoma remind us of how
much we have at stake...” Kemp said,
“We have the responsibility of protect-
ing the greatest liberal democracy on
the face of the earth, and this great
university is at the epicenter of pre-
serving that system.”

After 13 years playing professional
football, Kemp was elected to Con-
gress in 1970 as a representative from
Buffalo, New York.

He was appointed HUD Secretary
under President Bush.

Currently, Kemp is chairman of Em-
power America —-— a conservative
think-tank.

Spring Kickoff will conclude to-
night with a cookout in the Baker-
Davis-Gilliam Quad followed by a con-
cert of Everything and Jackopierce at

uled for March land 2, I996.

diplomatic contact with the U.S. on the stalled reactor deal. North Korea
has not, however, expressed a desire to reopen negotiations.

Hamas vows that Israel “will
pay” for activist’s death

The militant Islamic group Hamas warned on Tuesday that Israel will
pay a high price for the death of Abdel—Samad Hassan Harizat. Harizat, an
Islamic activist, is said to have died following an interrogation/torture at
the hands of the Israeli secret police, according to human rights organiza-
tions and Harizat’s relatives.

The Nation

Nichols and McVeigh face
charges

   

On Tuesday, Federal authorities charged Terry and James Nichols with
conspiring with Timothy McVeigh to build explosives at their farm in

Michigan. The charges are officially unrelated to the April 19 bombing of ..
the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. However, they allow authorities to " "

keep the Nichols in custody while they attempt to connect them to
McVeigh. McVeigh is being held in an Oklahoma prison on bombing
charges. Another unidentified suspect remains at large and is the subject of
a nationwide manhunt. Authorities in Oklahoma City continue to search
the remains of the building for bodies. So far, eighty people are known to
have died in the bombing. One hundred and thirty nine people are still
missing, presumed to have been trapped and killed by the ruble.

Dahmer settlement approved

On Tuesday, the Milwaukee Common Council approved and $850,000
settlement of a lawsuit against police involved with one of the Dahmer
murders. On May 27, 1991, two policemen found drugged, injured, naked
Konerak Sinthasomphone on a street. They returned him to Jeffrey
Dahmer, who convinced them that the fourteen year old was his lover.
Dahmer killed the boy several hours after he was returned.

Cisneros announces HUD plans

Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros announced on Tuesday that HUD
has approved plans to demolish 2,247 apartments in run down housing
projects. Over the next two months, apartments in Philidelphia, St. Louis
and Atlanta will be torn down and replaced with smaller, more humane
low-income housing units.

The State

Board of Elections bars Repub-
lican primary

On Tuesday, the State Board of Elections voted to bar Republicans in
the 97th House of Delegates District from holding a primary election. The
Board issued the ban because primary certifying forms were not received
by the April 19 deadline. District GOP chair Carol Mann, whose husband
is one of the four Republicans trying to secure the nomination, said she
mailed the forms two days before the deadline.

T. Benton Gayle Middle School
returns magazine to stacks

Last week, Seventeen magazine was returned to the stacks at T. Benton
Gayle Middle School following an investigation of a faculty review
committee. The popular magazine was pulled in March because of a
complaint from parent Michael Berry. Berry objected to the availability of
the magazine because it contained an advice column that discussed
homosexuality. The review committee has recommended that all parents
be allowed to notify the school if they do not want their children reading
the magazine. The final decision will be made by Superintendent Russell
Watson.

Board of Education to discuss
prayer events

The Virginia Board of Education hopes to discuss guidelines for student
initiated prayer during the Board’s retreat in Staunton this week. At certain
Virginia schools, students are allowed to meet before school and pray.
Members of the Board are proposing that teachers stay away from these
gatherings. Some ministers and parents oppose the guidelines because they
say that the teachers stay away from these gatherings. Some ministers and
parents oppose the guidelines because they say that the teachers should
have the same rights as the students during non-school hours.

Sexual Assault

PAGE 3

  

W&Lpolicy affords survivors many options

By ANNE E. ALVORD
Phi Staff Member

Unwanted sexual contact. Forced sexual contact. Physi-
cal assault with sexual intent. Sexual intercourse without
consent. Use of authority in attempt to gain sexual favors.
All of these acts are deﬁned as sexual misconduct under
Washington and Lee’s Policy and Procedures on Sexual
Misconduct.

More cases of sexual misconduct have been reported to
the Student Faculty Hearing Board than in past years,
according to Associate Dean of Students Anece McCloud.
In 1993-94, there were three cases of lncivility (verbal
sexual abuse) reported and two of Misconduct (physical
sexual abuse), though none of the cases went before the
SFHB. Numbers for this year are not yet available.

“The reporting, at least for this year, is on the increase,”
says McCloud. “It’s good that reporting is increasing, but

not that this is happening.” McCloud, who has been at
W&L for nearly ten years, can recall a time when a person
who had been sexually assaulted didn’t talk to anyone
about it, and therefore thinks that an increase in the number
of reports is good.

Not only women come to McCloud for information I

about sexual misconduct. Men have come to her as well,
some wishing to make complaints, others looking for
information about the policy, concerned that a woman may
accuse them.

When complaints of sexual misconduct are made, they
are reported to McCloud, who meets with the complaintant
and explains the options before him or her.

First, he or she can do nothing.

The next option is to ﬁle a report, which will be kept on
ﬁle but not acted upon. In such a case, McCloud would keep
the report, in order to monitor patterns of behavior that
might emerge.

If the complaintant wishes, mediation may be pursued. In
such a situation, McCloud acts as the University's mediator.
She serves as a neutral party treating both the complaintant
and the accused equitably. She wishes to stress that if
mediation is pursued, the complaintant does not necessarily
have to face the accused, although the mediation can take
place face to face if the complaintant so wished. Mc Cloud
will only talk with the accused with the permission of the
complaintant. She says mediation, which is by naturejan
informal procedure, depends upon the two parties being
willing to work things out. . _

If the complaintant wishes, or if mediation fails, a judi-
cial process can be pursued, in which the case will be heard
by the SFHB. If this route is taken, McCloud will notify the
accused that a complaint has been ﬁled. The two parties are
given student advisers, often student advocates from the

Law School, who will advise the parties in preparing their
statements and presenting their cases. Student advisers may
not, however, speak in the hearing unless granted special
permission by the chair. _ .

If it is also possible for a complaintant to seek criminal
action against the accused. McCloud stresses criminal_ac-
tion and campus judicial action are not mutually exclusive.
In cases where both actions are taken, the SFHB will often
hold their hearing until after the criminal proceedings have
been concluded. Exceptions to this policy might be cases in
which it is feared that the accused student will leave school
before the criminal case is resolved.

There is no order to the options in front of a complaintant.
There is no process through which he or she has to go to take
one step as opposed to another. McCloud, when she meets
with a complaintant, outlines each of their options and
allows them to choose their own path. The action taken is
always dependent on the complaintant’s desires, says
McCloud, and she only provides information about the
paths of action available.

No action is taken without the consent of the complaintant,
with one exception. If McCloud sees there is an immediate
threat to the community, she may refer the case to the Dean
of Students, who will in turn, if he sees the need, refer it to
the President of the University, who may dismiss the student
from the University. This might happen in a case where a
pattern has developed in the person’s behavior. ‘‘I look ﬁr
certain things...the kind of behavior the frequency, in-
stances where it involved violence,” explained McCloud.
When such an action is taken, the matter becomes an
administrative one rather than a judicial one.

McCloud points out several of the beneﬁts of pursuing a
campus judicial hearing in matters of sexual misconduct, as
opposed to a legal one. First, the campus system is based
entirely on codes of conduct. When a case goes before the
SFHB, there is not the necessity of preponderance of evi-
dence to find the accused guilty.

McCloud is wary of generalizing about the severity of the
sanctions because the board may use any combination and
she has confidence in the board to use their judgement in
deciding sanctions. In a more general sense, she is glad that
the board does not impose single sanction, because the list
of offenses which classify as sexual misconduct are so
varied. “I feel this is a very serious matter,” she maintains,
“but there is a very wide range [of offenses].”

There are several routes available to a complaintant.

Emotional effects of attack may not appear immediately

By CHRISTINE GARNAVISI-I
Phi Staff Member

Imagine four college women you
know. According to statistics, one of
those women has experienced sexual
assault. Sexual assault affects every-
one. Students need to be familiar with
the emotional as well as the physical
effects of such traumatic occurrences.

Although the victim may not di-
rectly state what has happened to her,
there are many warning signs that sexual
assault has occurred. Short term signs
include crying without apparent rea-
son, withdrawal from social activities,
and display of suicidal tendencies. The

victim may refuse to leave her room
unless necessary, and may experience
a lack of concentration accompanied
by a signiﬁcant drop in grades. In
addition, she may stop eating or en-
gage in substance abuse. Sadly, re-
search shows that 80% of women with
eating disorders like anorexia and
bulemia developed such problems as a
result of an assault.

According to Dr. Anne Schroer-
Lamont, Associate Dean of Students
and counseling psychologist, the most
misunderstood result of a sexual attack
is promiscuity. The victim may begin
to flirt frequently and express a desire
for sexual relations with men, even
ones she had no previous interest in.

However, Dean Schroer-Lamont warns
initiating sexual relations under these
conditions is the worst course of action
for male acquaintances of the victim.
No matter how rational the woman
may appear, she is in no condition to be
making such decisions and may not
realize the repercussions of
her actions.

A symptom which may arise in the
longer term aftermath of sexual assault
is Rape Trauma Syndrome, which is
generally divided into four phases.
Phase One is the Acute Phase, Disor-
ganization, in which the victim experi-
ences immediate impact reactions, such
as shock and heightened emotional ef-
fects. This phase also includes physi-
cal, medical and emotional reactions,
social adjustment, and economic ef-
fects. Her thoughts may range from
repression to dissociation, sometimes
including ﬂashbacks. Phase Two, De-
nial, occurs when discussions and
thoughts of the attack are avoided. In
Phase Three, bong Term Process, Re-
organization, the victim undergoes
physical, psychological, social and
‘sexual lifestyle changes. Finally, in
Integration/Recovery, she reaches a
resolution, encountering a feeling of

safety, righteous anger, an ability to
trust again and a desire to help others
undergoing similar trauma.

Schroer-I..amont said the reactions
of victims to sexual assault “are differ-
ent in timing and degree for each indi-
vidual student.” Stressing that both
men and women can be victims, she
explained that rape and assault are ex-
pressions of power. Survivors feel a
lack of control, and it is important to
give them the ability to make
decisions again.

There are many ways in which a
friend can help a victim of sexual as-
sault. An important first step is simply
to believe her, since a major fear of
victims who come forward is that they
will be accused of lying. Related to
this, the conﬁdant must take care not to
say things such as “I can’t believe it.”
Although meant as an expression of
sympathy,the victim mayinterpret such
statements as disbelief.

Also, she is looking to her friend as
a comforter, so let her talk. Try to calm
her down, and reinforce that the attack
was not her fault, although she may not
believe this at ﬁrst. Provide protection
and ﬁnd her a place to sleep where she
feels safe. Encourage her to seek im-

mediate medical attention and a pro-
fessional counselor to assist in her re-
covery and legal procedures should
she so choose.

Lastly, it is important that the friend
also ﬁnds help. Friends cannot do
everything, especially if unexperienced
in such situations. It is vital that the
victim know the friend ’s availability as
well as their limitations.

Schroer-Lamont said there are many
local and campus resources available
to assault victims. In addition to psy-
chologists such as herself and Dr. James
Worth, the Rockbridge Area Coalition
Against Sexual Assault has trained vol-
unteers that are constantly on call.
RACASA offers courses for those who
would like to help in the fall, and
Schroer-Lamont encourages both stu-
dents and faculty to get involved.

A sexual assault support group is
also available and attendance strongly
encouraged. The group on campus has
existed for eight years. Everything that
happens there is conﬁdential, and it
can be a vital source of support.

University Health Services offers
free medical treatment to assault vic-
tims. Like the university counselors,
services are completely conﬁdential

and free of charge. The inﬁrrnary has
resources to provide pregnancy test-
ing, medications, HIV testing, and the
morning after pill, although it is impor-
tant to note that the latter step must be
taken within 72 hours. Should further
medical attention be needed, there is a
nurse on duty 24 hours a day at the
Health Center who can transport vic-
tims to Stonewall Jackson
Medical Center.

Schroer-Lamont wants victims to
understand, however, that medical
treatment and counseling services go
hand-in-glove. Although it is not im-
possible to recoverwithout professional
assistance, she said that most who try
to heal without attention often wind up
repressing the incident, which will re-
sult in nightmares or other psychologi-
cal problems later in/life.

Despite this, victims need to under-
stand that it is never too late to come
forward and ask for help.

“There is a time when some are
ready to heal,” says Schroer-Lamont.
“Some need to have that very protec-
tive, quiet time, but when the time
comes to talk, you’ll know. And it’s
better sooner than later, but better later
than not at all.”

Security meets immediate needs of victim

By ANNE E. ALVORD AND DAN ODENWALD
Phi Staff Members

When a student is sexually assaulted, Washington
and Lee Security is there to help.

Director of Security Mike Young outlined the
procedure for dealing with potential rape victims.

“Making a police report is one of the ways we can
take care of this,” said Young.

First, a security officer will talk with the victim.
The primary concern is to calm the victim and ensure
her immediate safety. This time also allows security
to learn more about the crime.

“We support (the victim) in anything they want to
do,” said Young.

Next, the victim is given medical attention. It is
recommended that the victim consent to medical
exams as if she wished to prosecute even if she has no
such intentions. Often times the victim is too dis-
traught to think clearly and make long-term deci-
sions.

After the medical exams are completed, the vic-
tim is given the option of ﬁling a police report and/or
campus report, This procedure is very difﬁcult for
the victim for she is required to explain in explicit

detail the events of the assault. Support is readily
available, however. Campus counselors and victim
advocates make themselves easily accessible to as-
sist the victim through her ordeal.

The ﬁnal stage lasts the longest and is usually the
most helpful to the victim — long-term psychologi-
cal counseling.

The victim can work through her emotions of
rage, depression, guilt, and mistrust with a trained
therapist. Washington and Lee has two trained
therapists who perform services free of charge. All
visits are absolutely conﬁdential.

Despite the elaborate procedure in place to deal
with sexual assault, it is the aim of W&L Security to
prevent it from ever happening in the ﬁrst place.

Unfortunately, problems have relentlessly plagued
those preventative measures.

Locks on the hallway doors of the freshmen
women have been a constant headache for security
ofﬁcials.

“We’ve repaired them several times, and they’re
always down and up,” Young said.

Presently, the locks have been removed from the
doors altogether.

Security is attempting to install a new card—oper-

ated safety system. The project should be completed
by the fall, said Young.

Some students may wish to learn more about
W&L’s safety record.

Students who are concerned with infonnation
regarding previous crime on the W&L campus will
not face administrative stonewalling..

Federal law requires that every college campus
publish a yearly document reporting all crime that
occurred in the past year. The law was enacted in
honor of a female student who was raped and killed
at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania.

Young urges victims of sexual assault to report
the crime to security. Unfortunately, he believes
there is a possibility that only a fraction of rape cases
actually go reported on campus.

OPINION

 

W&L students aren’t only Victims of assault policy

MY VIEW
Lori Ramsey, ’96

Everyone knows that Washington
and Lee women are not the only fe-
males present at W&L parties. One
cannot spend a day on the Hill without
hearing comments about “ girls’ school
girls” or “road cheese.”

I have a unique perspective of social
life at W&L. I am an exchange student
from Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege in Lynchburg. I have experienced
the social scene both as a Randolph-
Macon student and as a W&L student.

I have a theory that women’s col-
lege women are more likely to be sexu-
ally assaulted than those who go here.

I cannot back this up with any data, but
I do know what I have seen and how I
have been treated.

On the occasions when I came to
W&L parties as a Randolph-Macon
student, I felt like I was beingscammed.
As a Washington and Lee student, I
feel the men I meet at parties are more
likely to talk to me like I am a person
rather than “a sure thing.”

A while back an anonymous male
wrote a letter to the editor in The Tri-
dent calling W&L women “potted
plants.” His point was that while they
are pretty to look at, you cannot do
anything with them. Girls from
women’s colleges, on the other hand,
are more fun, the writerimplied. Trans-
lation? We are “easy.”

My freshman year, I came to a W&L
party duringprospective students week-

end with a bunch of other Randolph-
Macon students.

Later that night I found a classmate
of mine. She was half naked. She had
left the party with a guy she had met.
She went back to his room. They fooled
around a bit, and he brought out a
condom. She said no; he said, “Oh,
you’re on the pill.” She said no, she
didn’t want to have sex. He attempted
to rape her.

She threatened to urinate on him,
and he let her go to the bathroom,
telling her he knew she would return
because she didn’t have her clothes.
She high-tailed it out of the
dormitory, wearing little more than
her underwear.

She and I went back to retrieve her
clothes. I was shocked to see two pro-
spective students asleep on the ﬂoor.

The colloquial term on campus for
women’s college students is “road
cheese.” It makes my skin crawl; it
implies that we do not matter as human
beings and whatever treatment we re-
ceive, we deserve.

I am not saying that all W&L men
are rapists; the great majority are not. I
do believe, however, that women’s
school students are easy targets for
those who choose to misbehave sexu-
ally. We are an hour or so away from
home; we get drunk and tired, and we
are vulnerable.

The issue of sexual misconduct at
W&L involves many women whose
voices are not heard on this campus. A
W&L student who has raped a woman
from another school will never have
to face her on the Colonade
Monday morning. —

He needn’t expect harsh punish-
ment from the administration either. A
while back the Student Faculty Hear-
ing Board sentenced a sex offender to
social probation and restrainment from
the freshmen dorms. That same week
a member of the student body was tried
in an open hearing and expelled for
cheating on two homework assign-
ments. The contrast appalled me.

At W&L lying, cheating, and steal-
ing are not tolerated. Any of these
offenses result in expulsion. But rape,
a felony offense, is not taken
as seriously.

My freshman year two Randolph-
Macon women filed sexual assault
charges, regarding two separate inci-
dents, with the Hampden-Sydney Code
and Conduct Committee. In both cases
the accused were found guilty, expelled,

and turned over to the Farmville au-
thorities to face criminal charges.

I talked to an acquaintance on the
Hampden-Sydney Honor Court. He
admitted that perhaps the school had
been particularly harsh on the students,
in order to make an example of them,
but added, ‘‘I’m damned well going to
make an example so it doesn’t
happen again!”

Ifa man’s college can take such an
intolerant postion regarding sexual as-
sault, then why doesn’t a co-educa-
tional institution like Washington
and Lee?

Considering the attitudes towards
women’s school women on campus,
sometimes it scares me that I ever went
to a W&L party as a Randolph-Macon
student. It scares me that I have friends
who continue to do so.

.(/Jezajbcctiuea on dating

By GEOFFREY BOURNE
Phi Staff Writer

“You’ve hooked up three times already! Wow, I didn’t know you guys were
going out!” ,

This is typical W&L mentality on what is considered dating. In my opinion,
if you see someone of the opposite sex at a party (or certainly if you go to the party
speciﬁcally with them) and you’ve already hooked up with them a couple of times
and it’s likely you’re going to be saying “hello” to each other in the morning -
you’re dating. I asked a typical (or as his friends regard him, atypical) male W&L
student if he thinks regularly hooking up is viewed as dating.

“Yeah, that’s dating. It kinda shows how the nature of the social scene at W&L
inhibits the friendship side of dating. The person you’re dating should be your
best friend and it doesn’t happen at W&L.”

Now, I don’t mean that just because you hook-up with someone that you’re
automatically dating them. To achieve true W&L style dating requires some
effort. First, regular hooking up is required, nay, demanded! The next parts are
all optional: a nice cold Natie Light, a loud good or bad band playing (you’re
probably drunk anyway, so who cares about quality), and a convenient “get
together” spot. If you approximately hook up every band party you both are at,
whether you like it or not, you, sir, are dating. . .W&L style that is.

On the W&L campus, dating is rarely seen. “You don’t see couples lining up
in front of the Colonnade. You’re more likely to see guys hanging out drinking
in a fraternity house or guys piling in cars to go down the road,” commented
another W&L male.

“Do you think this social scene [band parties etc.] is wrong?”

“No, it’s fun! It kinda shows were still in the Road School mode. Were still in
the single sex mentality where we center on Road Schools and one-night stands,”
this wisely anonymous W&L male answered.

“The whole party scene emphasizes hooking up and one-night stands. The
fraternities create the parties and they emphasize hooking up,” viewed yet
another anonymous source (boy, people don’t seem to like their name in print
anymore - at least for this subject).

So, the question is, are fraternities bad for dating. Maybe, but are we willing
to give up that Saturday night party with our favorite band and are we, as college
students, willing to give up hooking up? Hell Noll Call it a sense of pride in
tradition.

“Dating is pretty much restricted to formal weekends. It’s hook up fest unless
you need a date for something,” this again wisely anonymous male student
commented. “The whole social scene is centered around band parties. If you hang
out with a girl you go to the party with her. What’s there to do in Lexington to go
out on a formal date? Go to the State Theater?”

However, not everyone agrees with this view of W&L style dating. “Do you
think there’s a lot of dating at W&L?” I asked my roommate Pat O’Connell.

I think there is a lot of dating going on at W&L, about 10%, but none of it
involves Pat O’Connell!” he remarked. We all feel your pain or pleasure Pat,
whatever the case may be?!

“It takes a lot to succeed” to be a couple at W&L. “People pull you in opposite
directions. You want to hang out with your fraternity brothers and road trip.” I

‘figuess that’s a choice that one has to make between noncommittal hooking up and

.35 The movie is essentially about com-

“ing of age in ﬁfties Ireland. Two young
country girls, Eve and Benny, leave the
little hamlet of Knockglen and go to
university in the big city of Dublin,
where they face a welter of new inﬂu-
ences, thoughts, and perspectives. At

the center of these new opportunities

are, of course, love, sex and men.

Once in Dublin, they meet an old
friend, Nan, who moved there years
ago and seems to know already the
ways of the world; she gives them their
entrance into this realm of masculine
mysteries.

From there the movie focuses on
their interaction with the various men
in their lives: Jack Foley (Chris
O’Donnell), handsome rugby-player
and future-doctor; Sean Walsh, the pale,
creepy shop-clerk who represents the
old, small ways; and Simon Westward,
an older Protestant whose snobby fam-
ily once ruled the town but is now short
on money.

The various twists and turns the
relationships take are the basis for most
of the plot, with a few side-plots about
religion, embezzlement and family ten-
sion thrown in for good measure.

Noted Irish director Pat 0’Oonnor
doesn’t make as much of the beautiful
countryside as he probably should have,
but otherwise he does a very respect-

Woman and The Three Musketeers.
As Jack he exudes all the charm and
vigor we expect of him. A trickier role
is that of his love interest, Benny,
handled by newcomer Minnie Driver.
She doesn’t seem to make any mis-
takes, but we are left feeling that her
character is missing something.

This is the case with almost the
entire cast — they don’t really mess
anything up, but we feel like they are
only half there. The reason for this is
the poor adaptation from Maeve
Binchy’s novel.

Screenwriter Andrew Davies has
produced ﬁne dialogue and action, and
there are no uncomfortably ‘cinematic’
moments. But he has done a terrible
job of moving the characters from the
pages of the novel to the frames of ﬁlm.
We are left with incomplete pictures of
some of the most important ﬁgures,
especially Nan and Jack. As a result,
the audience doesn’t understand events,
actions and reactions that occur on the
screen.

The result of this is that Circle of
Friends is sort of a non-picture. There
is nothing particularly troubling about
it, and it won’t be a terrible experience
to sit through. But there is also nothing
in it which is compelling, thanks to the
wide cast of characters and their in-
complete development. If you have
read the book, you will almost cer-
tainly be disappointed in the adapta-
tion. If you haven’t read the book, you
will probably just be bored and a bit
confused.

If you need a thoughtful date ﬁlm,

The acting is similarly unremark-

The way I ﬁgure it the women are bucking 246 years of the ‘dating’ traditions
of an all male school. And as most other traditions at W&L, they’ve become
extremely difﬁcult to change.

Many women, lured by the brochures advertising the 60:40 male to female
ratio arrive expecting men to fall at their feet in desperation. (Okay how many of
you honestly never thought at least once, “hmmmm more men than women =
dates galore”)

The reality is a little bit different. It would seem the males (after 10 years) have
still not adjusted to seeing the girl they woke up with Saturday morning in their
Calculus class on Monday.

“I believe the ﬁrst and last date I had at W&L was some random formal
function. I don’t think he would have even asked me if it hadn’t been some
required pledge thing,” said one ‘dateless’ W&L woman.

The most common response to the question of have you gone out on a date
since the beginning of school was, “sure we did the dinner thing.”

Others were less sure. One replied, “Well, she was there so I said ‘do you want
to go to Goshen’ does that count?” Another said,” is going jogging or sitting out
at the Liberty Ruins just talking for a long time, a date?”

Not all women at W&L are interested in traditional dating. The ‘hook-up’
scene has its many advantages, the free beer, no sticky ‘relationship’ discussions,

“I believe the first and last
date I had at W&L was some

~ random formal function.”

no monogamy, and of course the ‘been there done that’ gossip.

“My work load doesn’t allow the time to date, and I don’t need the added stress
of dealing with pleasing men’s petty egos, it is nice to just leave it with ‘hey see
around or something.” said one practical W&L woman.

There is hope for those romantic idealist who long for candlelight dinners and
nights in front of a crackling ﬁre listening to John Tesh. W&L graduates have
been known to marry, or at least get engaged.

“Besides the carriage rides, and Wilson Walker Lexington doesn’t offer much
in the way of romantic date spots, so I guess even Lexington itself helps support
the ‘hook-up’ scene,” said ‘dateless’ W&L woman.

Talking to the women around W&L offered some insight into dating in
general. Women didn’t come to school to ﬁnd the right husband, or the proper
boy-friend. Education is very important, and most don’t plan on marriage until
after graduate school, or medial school, or law school.

“I have another four years, at least to play, and tying myself down to one guy
just screams boring to me. I am not my mother, I am making my own life ﬁrst,”
class of ’98.

Everyone has at least one story of a hook-up gone awry. Whether both parties
passed out, or the police were involved the ‘hook-up’ scene offers a lot of
amusement Monday morning.

"ParalleZTime explores
tragedyin the family

But things had changed. Staples simply didn’t

By MICHAEL HEWLETT
Phi Associate Editor

The summer before my freshmen year in col-
lege was ﬁlled with anxiousness and excitement.
Questions ﬂew through my head: What would
college be like? How would I ﬁt in? Would it be too
hard? I couldn’t wait to leave, couldn’t wait to have
a sense of independence. After Fall term, college
became home, and home became a place that I
went to on breaks and during the summer. When I
came home for Thanksgiving, I walked into the
house, and unfamiliarity was what I saw. I had
ceased to know home, and it took me awhile before
things became comfortable for me. A similar theme
runs through Brent Staple’s memoir, Parallel Time:
Growing Up in Black and White.

At the thematic center of this memoir is Staples’
drug-dealing brother, Blake, who is shot dead by
one of his customers. Learning about his brother’s
death leads him to a reconsideration of his life and
the distance he has put between himself and his
family. V

Staples, the oldest of nine children, grows up in

a small industrial town near Philadelphia. His
father is a drunk who beats on his wife. His family
moves quite frequently, getting evicted from place
to place.

He experiences what is common in adoles-
cence: the desire to ﬁt in, the discovery of girls and
sexuality, acts of mischief, etc. He goes to school,
lost in things unrelated to academics. He doesn’t
even know if he will go to college.

Just before he graduates, Sparrow, an adult
friend, asks him about college, pulls a few of his
connections, and gets Staples a scholarship to a
local college. His whole life changes. This is his
opportunity to leave and live a different life, a life
away from his family. He graduates from college
and pursues his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago.
He delves into Plato, Aristotle, Descartes and
others while shooting up drugs and making love to
women. After he gets his Ph.D., he starts writing
short stories and submitting them to various liter-
ary magazines. “He does all of these things, and he
sees his family less frequently.

“I’d promised myself that I would never spend
another Christmas under my father’s roof. Then
my mother left him and ﬂed to Roanoke with my
brothers and sisters in tow. Now I was obligated to
visit them, if only at Christmas. But nothing had
changed.”

want to face it. He had run so far away from his family
that when he did see them, he didn’t know them
anymore. One of his sisters becomes pregnant while
anotherone gets involved in drugs. Blake, his younger
brother, starts selling drugs in Roanoke and ends up
dead, shot by one of his customers. As he looks at his
brother’s body in the coroner’s room, he realizes how
much his town has changed. He notices for the ﬁrst
time how the industrial jobs have disappeared and
crack cocaine has come to take their place.

Staples writes a depressing story of a man’s es-
trangement from his family. He writes in clear, evoca-
tive prose, giving a vivid ﬂavor of the ‘60s and ‘70s.
He conjures up images of the fashions and the politics
of those time. He reminds us what growing up is like.
It gives us a window into our own experiences, our
feelings, our moments.

One thing bothered me. He mentions his girl-
friends, but I didn’t know who they were. He brings
them in and out at different points of the book. I kept
wondering what his personal relationships were like.

But, overall, I liked it. The depth of his family’s
problems and his separation from them moved me.
His story has a certain honesty. It spoke to me. He
talks about the past and our relationship to it. He
speaks to the difﬁculties of becoming independent
and keeping close to one’s family.

and rhythm.

“We really didn’t think about the candy when we named the record, the words just sounded good.” The candy to which Curnutte &
Maher is referring is Crackerjack, which also happens to be the name of their new album. The title may be the only aspect of the record into
which the band did not put much thought. Crackerjack consists of songs with a fresh, introspective message backed by a harmonic mix of guitar

The distinctive sound of Cumutte & Maher stems from the contrasting backgrounds and inﬂuences of the band’s two front men. Steve
Cumutte grew up listening to the Appalachian folk songs of West Virginia, while Matt Maher was raised in the urban setting of New Jersey
and enjoyed classic rock. They met and broke into the college music scene during their tenure at Wake Forest University. The melding of their
past experiences produced a type of music they describe as “Acoustic Folk,” a musical genre which combines honest lyrics with subtle country
undertones. Cumutte & Maher are currently touring colleges and coffeehouses nationwide, including an appearance last Tuesday evening at
W&L as the Spring Kick-off Band for the 1996 Mock Convention.

Cumutte & Maher’s songs in Crackerjack are mini-portraits of life, some light—hearted, others more reﬂective. They use visual imagery
and at times word play to convey emotions often lost in the recent explosion of acoustic-type bands. The album has been described as feeling
“as personal as a front porch jam and as universal as a rock and roll anthem.” For example, Cumutte & Maher discuss the transient nature of
hopes and dreams with lyrics such as “She wants to be seen as the girl of her dreams/At the alter on her wedding day/And the more she believes
in the things she can’t be/T he more she just fades away” in the song “American Fadeaway.” However, these emotions familiar to the electric
rock seem refreshingly new when set against traditional folk tones.

Indeed, Cumutte & Maher have captured the best of both worlds with Crackerjack. They have produced an album with an
uncompromising musical style that resists popular over-production and witty lyrics that can be appreciated by anyone with an ear for good music.

This week marks the 50th anniversary of the liberation of
the Nazi concentration camps by American soldiers. “An
Evening with Madame F” was the second of three events
taking place at W&L in honor of the liberation.

Claudia Stevens conceived and wrote this for her one
woman performance as pianist/singer/actor. Other recent
career highlights for Stevens include her acclaimed full-
length piece, “Playing Paradise,” in which she will perform
during its European debut this May in Budapest.

“An evening with Madame F” opens under the pre-text of
a survivor of concentration camps speaking tour to publicize
her book. What follows the opening monologue is a rather
vague transition from book tour to dramatic re-enactment of
time spent at the concentration camps.

Stevens begins the ‘tour’ by attempting to answer some
difficult questions posed to her by fictitious audience mem-
bers. She stretches to deal with issues beyond that of the
horrors of the Nazi camps.

The piece explores the life and death experience of music

accounts, including that of Fania Fenelon, who performed in
the Women’s Orchestra at Auschwitz until her deportation
to Bergen Belsen.

The entire show seems to balance between the reconcile-
ment of the use of talent for the selﬁsh reason to preserve
one’s own life and the horrors of one in the Nazi camps.

Stevens commands the stage with voice and movement
that compel the audience to stay attentive during her 45
minute production. The music of the show is somewhat
limited in its scope, and draws away from the power of the
words.

Throughout the production, one finds it doubtful that in
"an auditorium somewhere in the United States” this woman
would find herself driven to the re—enactment that is por-
trayed on stage. The convenient location of a piano and
snare drum, also lend to inappropriate introduction to the
crux of the play.

Stevens intricately weaves the lyrical story of the tal-
ented musician who played and sang Madame Butterﬂy to
rescue her self from death through reflections made by the
older woman.

There is beauty and magic in the way which Stevens
portrays different characters with a change in accent, or
pitch, or even language. Although it is a one woman show,

one woman, but a multitude of characters.

The music and electric sound central to Madame F were
orchestrated by Fred Cohen. He holds a Doctorate in music
composition fonn Cornell University. Cohen’s composi-
tions have been perfonned throughout the United States
and in South America.

Use of electric sound is first introduced as a background
support of the playing of the snare drum. This sudden
interruption drew away from the performance and dis-
tracted the audience with its hollow artificial sound.

During the final scene of Madame F. electronic sound
is more eloquently and emotionally used. The voices, and
airplanes help to transport the audience to the place where
Madame F. is reliving her horrors.

“An Evening with Madame F” was commissioned for
Holocaust Remembrance Day in 1989 by the Richmond
Jewish Federation, and has been given numerous perfor-
mance s throughout the United States.

Overall this performance of “An Evening with Madame
F” was a moving and thoughtful look at an aspect of the
concentration camps not often addressed.

The third event will be May 4 in the Northern Audito-
rium of the Leybum Library. Zev Kedem, a documentary

One of the leading modern dance companies in America for the past 20 years,
the Philadelphia Dance Company performed last Tuesday at Lenfest Center,
offering to the audience a dance program impressive for both its variety and rigor.

To melodies produced by ﬂute and drums as well as by modern symphonies,
in addition to selections from leading pop and jazz artists, Philadanco (the
company’s affectionate nickname) presented four ballets, alike only in their
precision of movement and choreography of American origin.

The curtain upon Pacing, a ballet choreographed in 1986 by Milton Myers.
The ballet, set to the tribal-inﬂuenced music of Francis Belby, consisted of four
sections in which the company members ﬂung themselves into movement after
spell-binding motion of arms, legs and head.

Pacing was followed by Dreamtime, a ballet that premiered in 1988 to the
somewhat robotic and mechanical music of David Van Tieghem. Choreographer
Elisa Monte arranged the dancers in an intense series of angular poses, danced at
intervals by one dancer, several, or by many in a complex dialogue.

lf any members of the audience were as yet unmoved by Philadanco’s

will speak. Clips from Schindler’s List will be featured

J.°tFc¢rev\l: local:

performance, surely none were after the third ballet, Elegy. Here the company
danced with somber facial expressions and elegant poses, against a backdrop
pinpricked into a starry black sky. To the moving choreography of Gene Hill
Sagan, the audience fell silent until the last strains of Ralph Vaughn Williams’
rich orchestral music.

Philadanco closed the evening with a piece completed only this year, entitled
A Rag, A Bone, And A Hank of Hair. Dressed in swirling costumes of tangerine,
mint green, turquoise, and gold, the company members performed Talley
Beatty ’s fresh interpretations of pop hits by such artists as Prince and Earth, Wind
& Fire.

A ballad by jazz artist Natalie Cole provided the accompaniment for a pas de
deux of an interesting characher, performed by soloist Desiree Lynn Pina and a
ladder.

The wide array of dances presented Tuesday explain the popularity of
Philadanco, a company renowned-—as the program itself allluded—”for its
superbly trained dancers who dazzle audiences with their grace and athleticism.”
The company has earned so impressive a reputation not lonly throughout
America but in England, Europe and Asia as well.

Offering unique contributions to the world of modern dance, Philadanco
Dance Comapany , hailed by critic Nancy Goldner of The Philadelphia Inquirer
for its “extraordinary stamina as well as a real ﬂair for sensuous, rippling
movement,” delighted Tuesday’s audience into a standing ovation. Only after
several rounds of applause did the curtain ﬁnally fall on such a talented troupe of
dancers.

simplicity as their first argument for
the ﬂat tax, the greatest argument is its
essential fairness. Finally, our
Constitution’s equal protection would
be granted to everyone, whether
billionaire or destitute. Yet this does

would bolster the American family as
an institution and return control of much
of the taxpayer’s money to the taxpayer.

The flat tax would also end the
backward system of incentives currently
in place that penalizes everything from
marriage to initiative. By instituting the
same tax rate for all Americans,
enterprise and initiative would cease to
be frowned upon, the tax code would
cease to assault the American family,

simplicity, it begins to return the
American people’s time and money to
the people.

J ack Kemp said Tuesday, “Our tax
system is a national disgrace-—it should
be ﬂat, it should be fair, and it should be
simple.” The sooner the American
people realize this, the sooner they will
get the fair, growth-promoting tax code
that Kemp called for and that Anney
has proposed.

Winter rush would probably Work Well

MY VIEW
Steve Williard, ’97

Washington and Lee University does not exist
for the sole beneﬁt of the fraternity system.

In view of the arguments that I have heard both
for and against the prospect of winter rush, I don’t
see why there should be the uproar that
has occurred.

We are stewards of a great tradition. That is
most certainly true. However, the tradition is not
always quite as rosy as we make it seem.

The fraternity system is part of the legacy that
we inherit from those who have gone before us at
this university. Whether or not fall rush is an
integral part of this tradition is a matter of debate,
and, in recent weeks, hotly contested debate.

Why not give freshmen a chance to have a life
that goes beyond the doors of the fraternity house,
if only for a term? With a winter rush, the incoming
freshmen would at least have a chance to get to
meet and form friendships that are not forced upon
them by the constraints of a pledge program.

Fall rush is an artiﬁcial way to begin the college
experience. For the first weeks of college, the
freshmen are exposed to constant parties, usually
three times a week. For the large majority of
students, this is not the environment that we exist
in now. If it were, there wouldn’t be much of a
reason to raise the standards for Dean’s List and
Honor Roll.

A winter rush would, in all probability, be a
great deal more relaxed. Freshmen would have
already been through a term at W&L, and would
have a much better idea of what the social scene
was like, and possibly, a better idea of what indi-
vidual fraternities were like.

Professor Williams, willing or not, has become
a spokesperson for the benefits of winter rush. For
the most part, I have not found any fault with his
logic. Maybe, with a winter rush, freshmen would
come to realize that this university places a higher
premium on academic performance than frater-
nity involvement.

A student would have the chance to work through
a term and get an idea of the workload required at

W&L before even deciding on a fraternity. While
this works in theory, it might not work in practice.
Wouldn’t some people have already formed their
opinions on fraternities by the time rush rolled around?
If that is true, then what is wrong with people having
a chance to make a more informed decision
before joining?

In any case, a fall term rush is not the mainstay of
tradition that it is made out to be. A winter rush does

quite straightforwardly that the Greek system is the
pre-eminent aspect of campus.

While fall rush is in place at other schools, it is
much worse at W&L precisely because the school
has such a solid Greek system. Because so many
males msh, fall rush is a schoolwide event that
extends beyond fraternity males. It includes the
entire student body.

friends at other schools, our fraternity system runs
without many of the problems that plague
other campuses.

There is no reason to abolish this tradition. What
we can and should do, however, is prove that the
priorities of this campus rest squarely on academics
and that special treatment is not given to the frater-
nities. In my opinion, fall rush is a concession to the
fraternities. It is a concession in the worst possible
way. Fall rush, with the attention that it draws, says

The faculty know (or should know) to take student
suggestions seriously. I think we are owed at least
that much. We are, after all, able to vote and are, for
the most part, reasonably responsible. However, I
think that in this case, the student opinion was
taken into consideration.

I think we also owe it to the faculty to respect their
decision and not jump to accusing them af any
ulterior motives. They have more than earned
that right.

OPINION

fHe1lo, I’11be your tour guide—suckers!’

GREEN LAND
if Betsy Green

This is really exciting: I have been
selected as a member of one of those
powerful three-letter committees. I am

.(a new member of the Student Recruit-
ment Committee (SRC). I will be giv-
ing tours to prospective students, and,
to paraphrase the handbook they gave
me, will be one of the ﬁrst representa-
tives of Washington and Lee those
‘prospectives and their parents will meet.
They also told me, “It’s yourrtour. You
can be as creative as you want.”
Those silly three-letter people.
I suppose now is the time that I should
‘ofﬁcially state in print that I really do
take my job seriously. I love W&L and
hope everyone else loves it as much as
I do, blah, blah, blah. But with that
aside, it’s fun to think of all I can do
-with a personalized tour of W&L.
My ﬁrst instinct was to think of spe-
cialized tours for groups with speciﬁc
interests. What gourmet wouldn’t love
“From Stop-In to Lee-Hi: A Culinary
Tour of Lexington”? Practical-minded
‘(folks will enjoy my tour of “The Best
Bathrooms at W&L.” Students will also
get some real W&L ﬂavor in a tour any
one of us could give: “Comfortable
Places On Campus to Sleep When You
k Really Should Be Working.”

My black little heart ﬁlls with glee
when I think about things I could say to
these prospectives and their parents to
leave them wondering about W&L. I

fight the temptation to say things like,
“Washington and Lee has no problems
with asbestos,” “There are no rats in
Gilliam. No mice either,” or, “They’ve
asked me not to talk about Robinson

Of course I’ll also have to mention
the thing about Washington and Lee
that scares Bocci Commissioner/Dean
Howison most of all: chocolate pud-

home to the Psychology Department,
Romance Languages, and the German
and Russian Studies Departments. It
has really pretty woodwork, which is
why I’m a Spanish major now.

Bocci and the commitment its students
have to heckling.

Naturally, I’ll have speciﬁc things to
say about the different buildings on

Tucker Hall: This is Tucker Hall,

part of this building other than the

Payne Hall: If you’re ever in English

they might say, “I think she’s in Payne!”
(At this point, I’ll laugh heartily.) You
know...Payne...pain...forget it.

Chapel, you’ll come away with the
feeling that the most important mes-
sageofWashington and LeeUniversity Calyx  Lecture

is, “Don’t swim in the North River.”

The University Center: The Univer-
sity Center is W&L’s pathetic excuse
for a student center. It doesn’t have a
bowling alley or anything, so don’t
bother looking for one.

The C-School: At this point, I’d like
to ask you all for a moment of silence in
reverence to the great edifice that is
the C-School.

The Bookstore: If you want to buy
any sweatshirts or anything, use my
student ID to charge them home to
my dad.

Leyburn Library: In the front of the
library, you can see a special display
devoted to my rival humor columnist
Richard Weaver. As you can see, there’s
a big picture of him wearing a seer-
sucker jacket, holding a straw boater
hat. Draw your own conclusions. Oh,
there are books and stuff here too.

ParmIyHall andHowe Hall: There’s
all kinds of stuff goingon in Parmly and
Howe that I don’t understand. They say
it’s science, but if you ask me, they’re
up to no good.

The Reeves Center and The Watson
Pavilion: Washington and Lee has one
of the largest collections of Asian ce-
ramics in the country. Go figure.

Yes, indeed, the SRC is one three-
letter committee that is inﬁnitely better
off with me as a member. Maybe some
day I’ll graduate to two letter commit-
tees. Just think what I could do with

LETTERS

Faculty, administrative breaches of student

autonomy have gone too far

To the editor:

Over the past several months, I have thought
extensively about the issues of student autonomy and

NI student governance, and I have followed closely the

debate about those issues that is growing on this
campus. Because of my experience with several
student-run committees and groups, I have some
deﬁnite opinions regarding this issue.

W« I feel that the current trend of administration and

faculty involvement in student affairs is thoroughly
unsatisfactory, and I am very concerned about the

increasing-control that the administration appears to «

be taking in student governance and student affairs.
By my judgment, many of the traditions that have
existed for decades and even centuries are
in jeopardy.I am most concerned about issues such as
the sophomore housing requirement and the move to
increase faculty intervention in traditionally student-
run organizations, although the issue of winter rush

f also concerns me.

The sophomore housing requirement, whatever it
may be billed as, is little more than an effort to erase
a ﬁnancial liability that is the result of a bad business
decision made years ago when those facilities in
question were built. The administration maintains

4 that the new requirement will promote class unity

and raise money to improve the educational opportu-
nities for the students. But what it really will do is
discriminate against women and independent men
who are not eligible to live in the recently renovated

y fraternity houses. It is completely wrong, wholly

unfair and should be repealed immediately.

In addition, I have heard and read about a possible
move by the administration to more closely oversee
student activities, and I have heard that a conglom-
eration of some of these committees (like the Student
Activities Board and the Fancy Dress Committee)
into one group may be in order. This move is simply
wrong, short-sighted, and damages a successful stu-
dent-run facet of college life by creating tension
between students and the administration where none
has previously existed. I am offended that some
people. don’t think that we students are capable
enough to set up our own activities. To oversee the
activities of students outside of the classroom repre-
sents an intrusion of authority where it is not needed
or wanted and gives the impression that the adminis-

tration doesn’t trust the students.

Considering the strong honor tradition on this
campus, to do something to create an impression of
mistrust serves only to ruin the community spirit that
supposedly exists here.

Also, to combine all or some of these committees
destroys a large number of very beneﬁcial leadership
positions. Some of the most practical experience I
have ever received in teamwork and in planning has
come through my involvement in these committees,
not in the classroom. No classroom assignment or
amount of lecturing can compare to the organiza-

tional and teamwork skillsthat are developed in these ’

committees, and they give students a chance to learn
valuable personal skills that would otherwise have to
be learned in the workplace.

Speciﬁc committees exist solely for the purpose
of coordinating student activities and these commitees
do a ﬁne job, especially considering that fraternities
and sororities handle many of the activities of well
over half of the students. We students have succesfully
run our own student activities for at least the past four
years, and we need to be told what to do now.
Michelle Richardson is a very ﬁne person, but as the
chairman of the Fancy Dress Committee this past
year I neither needed, sought not received any advice
from her, and I don’t think that the majority of the
students here needs or wants a person in her position.
If some student-run committees need occasional
assistance or advice, let them seek it on their own, but
under no circumstances should this assistance be
forced on anyone. I was glad to know that Ms.
Richardson could help the Committee if we needed
her, but I was even more glad to see that she didn’t try
to get involved where we didn’t need her. In my
opinion, her position caters to a minority of the
students at this school. If the school or some students
want to hire someone like Ms. Richardson to coordi-
nate student activities for those who need it, then they
should make sure that she is not forced to oversee
areas where she is not needed. In her present position,
her role at W&L where she serves only to assist
students who come directly to her is acceptable. I
fear, however, that Ms. Richardson is part of an on-
going effort to more tightly control student activities.
Her activities should be secondary to the efforts of
the SAB and the Greek organizations; students need
to control their own activities with as little assistance

as possible.

The large amount of student freedom at Washing-
ton and Lee in comparison with other similar col-
leges and universities is becoming a sort of rallying
cry for some professors. Professor Craun was quoted
in a recent Phi article as saying “student organiza-

tions have so much more freedom from faculty '

supervision than anywhere else.” He seems to assert
that this extra freedom justiﬁes the removal of some
of it. This freedom is why many of us came to this
school, and I will not tolerate the removal of any of
it. The United States gives as many freedoms to its
citizens as any other country. Yet I guarantee you that
if the government suddenly canceled one of the
clauses in one of the amendments to our Constitu-
tion, a grass-roots revolution like the one that founded
this country 200 years ago would develop immedi-
ately.

The fact that we have so much freedom at W&L
doesn’t mean that it is right to remove some of it. In
the United States, the government is a by-product of
the citizens, and is by, of and for the people. Unfor-
tunately, the same can’t be said for this school.

In terms of the winter rush debate, Dean Howison
says in his recent letter to the Phi that coeducation
was an unpopular move when it was made, but it was
the correct move and W&L has proﬁted from it. He
is correct; coeducation has had many more positive
effects than negative ones on this campus. Just be-
cause the administration moved in spite of student
opinions there and succeeded does not mean that this
success will happen again with winter rush. Coedu-
cation and winter rush are completely different is-
sues, and any parallels drawn between them must be
carefully analyzed. The pressures that the students
feel in regard to winter rush are not the same as any
that students in opposition to coeducation likely felt;
thus, the notion that we did what they didn’t want
once, so we can do it again” is foolish. Winter rush is
not favored by the majority of W&L students, and
even Dean Howison concedes this fact. That state-
ment alone should deter the administration and fac-
ulty from involvement in it. We don’t want it, so
don’t give it to us.

In my opinion, most of these new ideas about

This phenomenon is the

Frankly, I can’t understand why
the faculty has to oppose the students
with such force and why the admin-
istration and some faculty members
seem to turn such a deaf ear to student
ideas and problems. The professors
and administration members are here
only because of the students, and I
don’t like the way that large-scale de-
cisions on this campus are made with
little or no student input.

control our own lives outside of the
immediate classroom.

I do not appreciate infringement of
my rights by anyone, especially when
it concerns my social activities and
living arrangements.

Faculty and administration mem-
bers take note: I am no left-wing liberal
crackpot who feels that this school
owes him anything more than he has
earned. I am a mainstream and suc-
cessful W&L student, and I believe
that my ideas are in line with the beliefs
of a significant portion of the student
population. I am asking you to step

tween the students and the faculty and
administration can be resolved in a
compromising and peaceful manner,
but given the polarization of the sides I
fear that it cannot be. I am angry and
frustrated by the administration and
many of the faculty members, but I am
perfectly willing to discuss my opin-
ions with any dissenters, be they stu-
dent, faculty or administration. How-
ever, until I feel that this apparent se-
ries of moves without regard for stu-
dent opinion comes to an end, I hereby
pledge never to give so much as one
dollar to this school, and I urge other
students to do the same. I regret that it
has to come to this, but a man has to
stand up for what he believes is right.
Just ask Robert E. Lee.

Letters correction

In the April 21 issue of The Ring-tum Phi, a letter to the editor from
Joshua Heslinga ran under the headline, “Leadership lacking on winter
rush issue.” In the published letter, the statement should have read, “It also

strikes me as absurd for Professor Williams to say that he does not know .

anyone who wants to get rid of fraternities.” The mistake was purely the
result of interpolation by the typist and incomplete proofreading. The Phi
apologizes to Joshua Heslinga and Professor Williams for the error and any
confusion it may have caused.

Correction

In the story about Honor Roll changes in the April 21 issue, Professor
Hodges should have been quoted as saying, “We must respect the students
who really do achieve excellence.” The Ring-tum Phi regrets any confu-
sion over Professor Hodges’s meaning.

to earn the second seed.

Friday’s winners will meet
for the conference championship
on Saturday at 2:00 PM on the
Liberty Hall Fields.

Golfers grab title

W&L enters the tournament
having posted consecutive one-
goal wins over Roanoke, then the
nation’sseventh-rankedteam,and
Frostburg State, 5-4.

Frostburg led 4-2 at the half
over the struggling Generals, but
W&L battled back with an im-
pressive final 30 minutes,
outscoring the Bobcats 3-0.

With the game knotted at 4-4,
freshman Mary Jo Mahoney
scored her ninth goal of the season
with 4:21 left for the 5-4 victory.

Mahoney had also scored the
deciding goal at Roanoke as the
Generals clinched the regular sea-
son ODAC title.

Sophomore Brooke Glenn
stopped 16 shots in goal to break
the school single-season record
with 177 saves on the year. The
sophomore topped Erica
lngersoll’s old mark of 169 from
the 1989 season.

Glenn’s236careersaves place
her third on W&L’s all-time list,
52 behind Sarah Smith, who
stopped 288 shots from 1992-94.

Lynchburg, last year’s runner-
up to Roanoke, fell to fourth in the
ODACstandings following losses
to the Maroons and R-MC. Yet,
they had no trouble playing their
way into the semifinals with a 16-

5 win over Bridgewater in
Tuesday’s opening round.

Lynchburg is seeking its sixth
conference championship ever,
but ﬁrst since 1989.

Randolph-Macon beat Sweet
Briar, 14-2, in the other playoff
match-up.

The Hornets feature a high-
powered offense anchored by
junior Caitlin Sarkisian, who
scored five times versus
Bridgewater.

Sarkisian, Jessica Satinsky
and Carolyn*Roth will try to break
the Generals strong defensive
corps of senior Sarah
Aschenbach, sophomore Carrie
Borish and senior tri-captain
Carrie Niederer. Niederer was a
ﬁrst-teamAll-Southdefenderlast
season.

Defense could be the key in
all of this weekend’s action, as
all four teams boast goaltenders
who stop roughly sixty percent
of the shots against them.

Randolph-Macon, though,
could be the team with enough
ﬁrepower to shoot their way to
the title.

33 assists) is the league’s scoring

When Bill Raleigh took over the head coaching duties for Wash- ~

Raleigh became just the third coach in the 68-year history of the
program. When Buck Leslie retired last spring after a five-decade
relationship with Washington & Lee athletics, Raleigh was chosen to
lead the golf team in the interim.

Last weekend, just three weeks after Elmira Collcge’s Kevin
Moore was named W&L’s new head basketball and golf coach,
Raleigh coached his squad to the Old Dominion Athletic Conference

Cy Twombly and Leslie, was then honored as the ODAC’s Coach of

The Generals’ title was their eighth since the beginning of ODAC
play in 1977 and the school’s fifth in eight years.

Sophomore J ay Ingram was the individual winner with a 152, one
stroke ahead of Guilford’s Jamie McPherson and Randolph-Macon’s
Galen Foulois. Ingram shot a 71 on the toumament’s opening day.

W&L junior Gam Mattingly ﬁnished fourth with a 155, earning
All-Tournament team recognition along with Ingram.

The ODAC Playerof the Year award went tothe toumament’s 14th
place ﬁnisher. Sophomore Tommy Dudley shot just a two-day 162.
However, his season average of 76.2 per round and consistent play all
year was good enough to become the sixth General to receive Player
of the Year status.

Dudley’s opening day 79 at the tournament was his 12th consecu-
tive round under 80. Included in that stretch was a school-record 68
two weeks ago at Virginia Wesleyan.

Junior Trevor Spencer (163, 17th place) and Scott Miller (169,
26th) rounded out the top ﬁve for W&L.

The ODAC trophy is one more piece of hardware on a crowded
shelf of golf championship awards for Washington & Lee. During
Twombly’s reign from 1927 until his death in 1974, W&L won two
Southern Conference titles and six state championships.

Leslie’s 20 years with the golf team brought the school seven
ODAC tournament wins.

He also guided the Generals into five NCAA Division III Touma-
ments, where they placed in the top 10 three times.

.. The ’95 Generals must wait to see if they’ll receive a bid to
‘i. nationals, which will be held in mid-May at Terre Haute, Indiana.

It was a major league type
week for the Washington and
Lee baseball team as it earned six
decisions in eight days.

On Monday, the Generals
completed a suspended game
with Old DominionAthleticCon—
ference rival Hampden Sydney.
W&L won the contest, 11-10.
However, the Generals dropped
the ensuing game to the Tigers
by the count of 9-6.

Lynchburg then crushed the
Generals on Thursday in a game

Roanoke is playing the sea-

South selection Liz Florence (91
career goals), but All—ODAC
goalie Kathleen Ostar has helped
lead the Maroons to contention
for a NCAA Tournament bid.

A pair of wins this weekend
would give the school its sixth
conference championship in nine
years.

The Generals are after their
third tournament title. They took
home the 1992 crown with a 10-
9 overtime upset at Roanoke, and
won the 1993 championship at
the Liberty Hall Fields, 7-6, with
a last-second goal by Nicole
Ripken, one of six W&L seniors
wrapping up their careers.

Aschenbach, Ripken,
Niederer, Dana Cornell, Meredith
Long, and Lindsay Coleman will
take the Liberty Hall Fields for
the ﬁnal time.

Their careers have led the
Generals to a 43-17 four-year
record entering Friday’s semiﬁ-

W&L looked strong early on
as it jumped out to a 2-0 lead on
a two run single by Bates Brown.

The Hornets responded with
a four run second, and took over
for good in the third as they chased
starting pitcher Brett Hartman
(2-4) from the game.

A doubleheader on Saturday
against Guilford brought the end
of the season nearer as the Gen-
erals split with the Quakers.
W&L won the ﬁrst game, 13-10,
but dropped the second contest,
10-5.

The Washington and Lee men’s and women’s track teams pro 4
to the rest of the conference that they are among the best, posting th rd
and ﬁrst place ﬁnishes, respectively, in last weekend's ODAC

Outdoor Championships.

The W&L men’s track team got solid individual perfomtances‘
from both upper and undcrclassmen, and earned a third place overall‘

ﬁnish this past weekend at the ODAC Championships. iv . ’

Junior Harris Morrison won the pole vault by vaulting 14 feet,
equal to his personal best. Freshman Jason Callen was the other ﬁrst
place ﬁnisher in the men’s events. He cruised to victory in the 5,000
meter race, posting a time of 15.32.74. His closest opponent ﬁnished

eight seconds behind him.

Two W&L athletes posted second place ﬁnishes as well. Fredir
man shot-putter Omar Moneim reached 41 feet and seven inches, his

best toss of the season.

Senior Grant Cowell came close to giving the Generals a victory‘
in the 800 meters, but he was beaten at the ﬁnish line by a mere one-

tenth of a second.

Other W&L athletes who placed at the ODACs were senior Hayne

Fallon dies at 56

BY KEITH GRANT
Phi Staff Writer

Gary Fallon, Washington &
Lee’s head football coach since
1978, died suddenly Saturday
morning at his Lexington home.
The cause of death was an appar-
ent heart attack, according to a
source close to the family. He
was 56 years old.

Fallon, W&L’s winningest
football coach, came to Wash-
ington & Lee in 1978, a decade
after the Generals’ last
winning season.

During his 17 year tenure,
Fallon compiled a 76-85-1 record
and won two Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference championships.
Fallon was named the ODAC’s
Coach of the Year three times.

This past season, W&L started
with three straight losses, but fin-
ished winning five of their
last six for Fallon’s ninth
winning season.

The news came as a shock to
those who knew Fallon. Fallon
was “in great shape for a man 56
years old,” according to Norris
Aldridge,who has been an
assisstant football coach at W&L
for 26 years under three coaches.
Fallon lifted weights, ran, and
played racquetball. Aldridge said
in an interview with the Roanoke
Times & World-News , “When I
was told [that Fallon had died], I
had to ask the person to repeat it
twice.” Aldridge was in Fallon’s
office on Friday, and recalls that
“He seemed to be in a good mood.
He wasn’t sick.” Junior Robert
Hull called Fallon a “father fig-

superb motivator.

Coach Gary Fallon inspires players with a ﬁery pep talk
during a Generals football game. Fallon was noted as a

ure” to the players, the school, and the
community. “I can’t begin to describe
with words how I felt about Gary
Fallon,” said Hull. “I loved him. He
was my coach; he was my friend.”
The Syracuse University graduate was
the dean of ODAC football coaches.
Fallon came to Lexington after six years
as an assistant coach at Princeton and
coached the Generals longer than any
of the previous 27 head coaches in the
program’s 105 year history.
“Football is here to add to an
individual ’ s college experience, not take
the place of academics,” he said of his
coaching philosophy. “The aim of our
program is to develop the total person,
one who can leave us with his degree in
hand after four years, one who can
reﬂect back on his college career and
see it as a meaningful and important

learning experience.”

This may not have sounded like
the philosophy of a man who had
played big-time Division I football,
but it was a philosophy that seemed
to bring Fallon success throughout
his life.

Anative of Watertown, New York,
Fallon earned 17 varsity letters at
Watertown High and Manlius Mili-
tary School.

Fallon then earned a scholarship
to Syracuse University, where he
starred in football and lacrosse. A
fullback responsible for opening
holes for 1961 Heisman Trophy
winner Ernie Davis, Fallon was a
key member of the Orangemen’s
’59 national championship team. He
was a member of the All-East foot-
ball squad his senior year and, as a

starting midfielder, captained
Syracuse’s 1962 lacrosse team. He
also wrestled during his busy colle-
giate athletic career.

Following his graduation, Fallon
played three years of professional
football. After a season with the
Minnesota Vikings, Fallon went
north to the Canadian Football
League, where he played with the
Hamilton Tiger Cats and the Toronto
Argonauts.

He spent the next six years with
the U.S. Marine Corps, two years on
active duty and four as a reservist.

In 1967, he received his M.A. in
special education from Syracuse.

Fallon took the reigns of Wash-
ington & Lee football in 1978. Two
years later, the Generals posted their
first winning season since 1967, the
final year of Lee McLaughlin’s
coaching tenure. W&L has had only
four losing seasons since.

In 1981, the 8-2 Generals won the
ODAC for the program’s first cham-
pionship in 20 seasons. Fallon was
named the conference’s Coach of
the Year for a season that marked
the beginning ofW&L’swinningest
era since the Mclaughlin years. The
Generals capped their sixth straight
winning season by again winning
the ODAC title in 1985.

Fallon’s players have earned a
first-team All-ODAC selection 61
times and he has coached 12 All-
Americans.

This past fall, W&Lbegan Fallon’s
17th season by dropping its first
three games and totaling just two
points. However, the Generals came
together and posted a 5-1 record the
rest of the way. Included in that
stretch was a 13-7 upset of regional
power Guilford. The heavily
underdogged Generals stopped re-
peated late scoring attempts by the
7-1 Quakers, dashing the 5,300
hometown fans’ hopes for an ODAC
championship. “It was the most ex-
citing game I’ve seen in my 17
years,” Fallon said.

The Generals ended the season
with a 14-11 win at Swarthmore
College to earn a 5-4 record.

Fallon was a member of the Ameri-
can Football Coaches Association
and served on the NCAA Division

III rankings committee. He also
worked as an official for collegiate
lacrosse, working games in both the
ACC and NCAA tournaments.
Freshman Seth McKinley, whose
emergence at tailback helped spark
the team’s strong finish in ’94, said
Fallon played a large role in
McKinley’s decision to come to
W&L. “When I came to visit the
school, I had a long talk with him,”
McKinley said. “He was one of the
main reasons why I came here.”
Hull has chosen to dedicate his
final season with the Generals to his

career at W&L.

coach’s memory.

“He was an amazing individual
who helped to forge my character,”
Hull said. “He will always live in
my memory. My senior season goes
out to the ‘great Falcon.”’

Mike Walsh, Director of Athlet-
ics, is certain that Fallon’s 17 years
at W&Lwill be known as the ‘Fallon
Era’ in memory of the “enthusiasm
and zeal, the commitment to excel-
lence, and the ability to motivate
young men toward a common goal”
that Fallon embodied.

Fallon, an avid New York Yan-

kees fan, was a man who seemed to
make his mark at W&L in more
ways than as just a football coach.
Walsh believes the W&L commu-
nity to be in “a state of shock, be-
cause we’ve lost a true friend, a
wonderful coach, and an unusually
fine person.”

A 1979 reporter from The Ring-
tum Phi seemed to know the second-
year coach well when he noted,
“Head coach Gary Fallon is a nice
guy—too nice a guy to have a 2-10
career record.”

Walsh met with the football team
and coaches last evening, providing
an opportunity for them all to be
together and share memories and
thoughts about Fallon.

A funeral service will be held
Wednesday, May 3, at 11:00 a.m. in
Lee Chapel. Burial with military
rites will follow in the Stonewall
Jackson Cemetary in Lexington. The
family will receive friends from 3 to
5 p.m. and from 7 to 9 p.m. on
Tuesday at the Harrison Funeral
Home on South Main St.

Fallon is survived by his wife,
Patricia Grant Fallon, three daugh-
ters, and seven grandchildren.

Memorial donations may be made
to St. Patrick’s Church, 221 W.
Washington Street, Lexington, VA

Student injured in fall from Lexington roof

From Phi Staff Reports

Early Sunday morning, Sophomore Peter Breen
fell approximately ten feet from the roof of The Lee
Manor to a lower roof of the same building.

Breen, who had climbed to the top of the building,
the tallest in Lexington, via a fire escape with several
friends Patrick Madden, Chris Brooks, Erin Mullaney,

and Katie Moore.

Madden called Emergency Medical Services from
the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity house and Breen was
taken to the Stonewall Jackson Hospital where he

was diagnosed with a broken clavicle.

At 7:30 a.m., Breen was released into the custody
of the Lexington Police Department and charged
with trespassing and drunk in public.

Breen was held injail until 5:30 p.m. when he was
picked up by his roommate Burke Willard. Breen
was taken to the Washington and Lee Infirmary, and
after being questioned by Infirmary staff, Breen was
returned to Stonewall Jackson, where a CAT scan
was performed and a fractured skull was discovered.
At this time, he was airlifted to Roanoke Memorial
Hospital.

At 11:30 p.m. on Sunday, surgery was performed

Holocaust survivor recalls experience

Phi News Editor

When a black soldier tossed
him a standard—issue U.S. ra-
tion candy baron May 3,1945,
11-year-old Zev Kedem knew
something was strange.

The day indeed proved a
special one. That day Kedem
regained his freedom and his
life when American soldiers

liberated the German concen-
tration camp in which Kedem
had been living.

Thursday night in Northern
Auditorium, 50years and one
day after his liberation, Kedem
reflected on his experiences
behind the barbed wires of six
Nazi concentration camps. In
his speech, sponsored by Con-
tact, Kedem offered a descrip-
tion both of the wartime hor-
rors through the eyes of an 1 1-

year old and of his own under-
standing of events half a cen-
tury later.

Born in Poland in 1934,
Kedem first became ac-
quainted with the Nazi regime
in 1939, when the Germans
invaded Poland and began lim-
itingJewish behavior. Kedem
recalls the enforced wearing
of arm bands and badges.

The apartmentthathadonce

alone soon housed six fami-
lies, under German command.
“Immediately,” Kedem
added, “the fabric of human
life started falling apart.”
The ‘war effort’ justified
all adjustments German con-
trol brought to the life of Pol-
ish Jews. Kedem described a
work permit as a “passport to
life.” Not to be useful to the
state became grounds for death.
The Germans soon built a

ghetto for the Jewish commu-
nity, enforcing absolute Ger-
man control. The site chosen
for the barracks was the local
cemetary.

Kedem saw fellow Jews
forced to open the graves for
gold and riches, with all prof-
its donated to the Nazi cause.

By MICHAEL HEWLETT
Phi Associate Editor

With C—Span cameras panning Lee
Chapel, visiting professor of journal-
ism Roger Mudd chastised the increas-
ing tabloidization of the news profes-
sion and reflected on his years at Wash-
ington and Lee University.

He described how students made
fun of former W&L presidents who
thrusted their canes as they walked and
professors who forgot their students’
names when calling roll. Despite the
jokes, Mudd recalls what he learned
about intangible things such as honor,
integrity and dignity, he said.

“I can’t think of a place where my
code of ethics got a finer sharpening.”

Mudd, who graduated from W&L
in 1950 and earned a master’s degree in
history from the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1951, deliv-
ered the annual Robert L. Telford Dis-
tinguished Lecture entitled “You Can
Go Home Again.”

Better known as the man who al-
most got Walter Cronkite’s CBS

V ton correspondent, chief political cor-
respondent, co-anchor of the NBC

, Nightly ‘News, co-anchor of “Meet the

Winter rush
approved

By BETHANY BAUMAN
Phi Staff Member

Winter Rush is now a reality. On
Monday, eighty six members of the
faculty voted unanimously in favor of
two rush proposals authored by the
Student Affairs Committee.

The first proposal, which was ap-
proved by the SAC 7-4-1, states that
fraternity rush should be held in Winter
Term beginning in January 1997. The
details of the rush program will be
determined by the lnterfraternity Coun-
cil and the SAC. The second proposal,
unanimously approved by the SAC,
endorses the lFC’s plan to institute a
shortened pledge period to take place
immediately following 1995 Fall Term
men’s rush. Next year’s rush will be
similar to what occurred in 1994.

Theideaofmoving men’s rush from
Fall to Winter Term was first sug-
gested by Professor of Physics
Thomas Williams. Williams initiated
the proposal because of the results of
university wide studies done over the
past six years, including that of the
Coeducation Review Committee,
which focused on the social aspects of
life at Washington and Lee. These
studies recommended that a deferred
rush would be more beneficial for the
students. Williams also cites letters by
Deans Rrrscin and Manning which
strongly supported Winter Rush as rea-
sons for initiating the proposal.

Williams believes that, “...what po-
tentially could be gained on the part of
the students is a more rational
choice...Freshmen will have a better
chance to become accustomed to the
academic rhythm of the place...before
making a commitment in a social way.
After a semester, the ability to mesh
thosethings will be better. I think other
activities at the university will be seen,
and looked at more carefully by the
freshmen, because they will have the
time in the first semester,”

Williams found support for his idea
from the faculty and administrators.
Dean of the College John Elrod be-
lieves that a deferred rush will allow
both freshmen and upperclassmen in
fraternities to get a better sense of which
students will fit in at which houses.
Freshmen decisions will be based pri-
marily on their comfort and common
interests with the fraternity, not a ﬂurry
of rush activities. Elrod also believes
that, “It is very important for freshmen
to have a solid, unencumbered aca-
demic experience right away because
this is...an academic institution.” Fresh-
men need a chance to get to know the
faculty, the curriculum, the level of
demand, and have a chance to get to
know each other before they are di-
vided into pledge classes, Elrod said.

President John Wilson agreed with
his successor, stating that, “The pri-
macy ofrush coming so early in the fall
tends in the minds of many students
and...parents to distort the priorities of
the institution...The first objective is to
bring the primacy of the academic pro-

gram and getting adjusted to a new set
of expectations back and to give the
faculty an opportunity to really work
with these students without having a
very important social agenda going on
at the same time.”

Members of the IFC have opposed
the idea of Winter Rush since its con-
ception. President Ryan Connolly ex-
plained, “The IFC would have hoped
that it did not pass. We supported Fall
Rush. However, we also understand
the faculty’s position, and now that it
has passed, we’ll be willing to make it
work the best that it can.”

Despite Connolly ’s assertion, many
fraternity members have doubts about
the effectiveness of a Winter Rush.
Many fraternity men voiced concerns
about membership and finances. It is
believed that the smaller houses will
have trouble competing with houses
with larger budgets. These smaller
houses fear that their membership may
fall below the quota necessary to keep
their charter. Most fraternities are also
concerned that they will experience a
loss of revenue.

Opposition to Winter Rush has not
stopped with fraternities. Sororities
are also concerned that their rush will
be affected by the change. Freshman
Kappa Kappa Gamma Carson Flowers
said, “Fall Rush helps sorority rush in
that the females see guys getting ex-
cited ahmit the Greek svstem and it
helps us get excited also. The Greek
system as a whole will be affected by
Winter Rush, not just the fraternities.”
Mary Michael Pettyjohn added that
moving rush from Fall to Winter now
casts doubts on what freshmen men
will be able to do for social weekends
like Homecoming and Christmas.

The overriding concern among stu-
dents is that there has been an en-
croachment on their autonomy. Presi-
dent Wilson believes, “On social mat-
ters [students] want to feel that they
have control entirely 01' the shape of
their social lives...It’s an autonomy
question...I respect that point of view...I
hope that students would understand
that the faculty have been given the
authority by the trustees to set out the
parameters of the academic and social
life in the university. They have del-
egated that social side to the
students...They always had the author-
ity on reserve. Now when the aca-
demic program then it certainly gave
license to the faculty to exercise
its authority.”

The faculty’s Monday vote has not
closed the debate concerning Winter
Rush, but has moved that debate into a
new stage. The questions aboutwhether
or not the proposal is an attack on
student autonomy or whether partici-
pation in the Greek system will dimin-
ish are relatively unimportant. The
relevant concern is how effectively the
IFC and SAC will be able to work out
the details of Winter Rush and how
these committees and the administra-
tion will deal with any negative mem-
bership or financial ramifications of
the change.

Rwandan Army puts ‘soldiers on trial

Fourteen Tutsi soldiers were charged in a Rwandan military court
with aggrivated murder and other human rights crimes against the Hutu
population in the wake of the year long conﬂict between the two rival
groups. The government hopes that these trials will demonstrate that the
dominant armed forces are not above the law. Concurrently, the
Rwandan government indeﬁnitely postponed trials for approximately
30,000 Hutus accused of being connected with the massacre of Tutsis
last year before Tutsi rebels seized power from the Hutu led govem-
ment. JusticeMinister Alphonse Marie Nkubito claims to have sus-
pended the trialsbecause of a lack of money and magistrates to hear the
cases.

Mafia trial begins

Forty two alleged Mafia leaders went on trial this week for the 1992

the ﬁrst to unravel the inner workings of the Sicilian Maﬁa. He secured
long term jail sentences for 338 Maﬁa associates in 1987, including
major crime boss Salvatore Riina. It is also believed that Falcone was
expected to expose links between the Sicilian Maﬁa and Italy’s Chris-

after dictator Joseph Stalin forced the church to merge with the Russian

Progress in-Oklahoma City bombing
investigation

At daybreak on Tuesday, Gary Alan Land and Robert Jacks were

their recent travels have parallelled those of bombing suspect Timothy
McVeigh. However, investigators now doubt that Land is the second

The 2,100 refugees who ﬂed Communist ruled Cuba and are cur-
rently being detained at Guantanamo Bay will soon be allowed to
migrate to the United States. On Tuesday, the Clinton Administration
reversed its policy announcing that those currently at the Naval base
would be allowed to migrate, while any who attempt to in the future will
be forcibly returned to Cuba. Gen. John J. Sheehan, commander in chief
of the U.S. Atlantic Command that oversees Guantanamo Bay, stated
that concerns over'the refugee center’s one million dollar per day cost
and the possibility of unrest this summer forced Tuesday’s abrupt
policy change.

Weddle out of GOP race

OnTuesday,RepublicanstateSenatecandidate Gary Weddledropped
out of the‘ race, leaving Pat Cupp as the sole candidate. Weddle says he
dropped out of the race because he does not have the time to run a
campaign due to events in his personal life. Cupp, a Blacksburg

Teachers to receive higher pay in
Roanoke

The Roanoke School Board hopes to raise salaries of city teachers to
a nationally competitive level. On Tuesday, the board met with the City
Council to review the proposed $77.6 million school budget. Board
member Charles Day claims that salary increases will move the Roanoke
into the ranks of the top 25 in Virginia. The School Board also hopes
to reduce primary class size, reduce the dropout rate, and lessen the gap
between black and white students’scores on the Iowa Test of Basic
Skills.

Allen’s approval rating dropped

In the past nine months, Gov. George Allen’s approval rating has
dropped about thirteen percentage points. However, a poll taken by the
Virginia Commonwealth University showed that 15 percent rate Allen’s
performance as excellent, 38 percent as good, 32 percent as fair, and 15
percent as poor. A poll taken last July, 66 percent believed that Allen
had done a good or excellent job.

Stress at Washington and Lee:

Surviving the Pressure Cooker
By Dan Odenwald

You know it’s going to be one of
those days. You sleep through your
first class, skip lunch to write a paper
due at 1:00, fail a quiz, and have three
conflicting meetings that night. You’re
exhausted, irritable, and sick. You’re
suffering from stress.

Nearly every student at Washington
and Lee has been stressed at least once.
After all, this university can be a tense
place. Pressures from academics, Greek
life, relationships, and extracurriculars
can push a student to the limit.

A certain amount of stress can be
positive. It can motivate students to
manage their time better. However,
too much stress can be problematic.

At minimum, stress can disrupt
sleeping habits, eating patterns, and
work schedules.

Physical ailments and negative
psychological effects can result from
increasing stress. At worst, over-
whelming stress can completely over-
run a student.

A student can shut down and cease

to function. We’ve all heard the night-
mare stories of stressed out peers “ﬂip-
ping out.” _

She stayed in bed for 4 days. He
doesn’t eat at all. She stopped going to
classes. He doesn’t talk to any
of his friends anymore. She
attempted suicide.

Stress in college can be difﬁcult
to manage.

This Phi special report on stress at
Washington and Lee will highlight the
causes of stress, it’s side effects, pro-

ﬁles of students under stress, and tips
for dealing with stress.

Spring Term may seem like an un-
usual time to present this report, but
looking at stress in a characteristically
laid back time may help crystallize the
issue. . .

Most importantly, we hope our read-
ers will use the following information
to their benefit. College stress can be
dangerous. Knowingthewamingsigns
and coping skills can make every one’s
life a little bit easier.

 

Causes for stress vary among W&L undergrads

The reasons for stress are as varied as its manifes-
tations. Ask 20 students why they are stressed and one

will get 20 different answers.

Despite the many different factors causing stress,
underlying similarities are clearly identiﬁable.

Causes for stress can include lack of sleep, mis-
management of time, drinking too much or for the
wrong reasons, illness, and not eating properly. Psy-
chological problems, of course, can lead to stress. The
death of a family member, breaking up with a signiﬁ-
cant other, and switching residences cause stress.
Studies have shown that even happy events cause
stress. Marriages, new births, and graduations, while

Every Washington
and Lee student deals
with a certain amount of
stress. Some deal with
considerably more. You
know who they are.
They’re the ones who
chair two committees, are
an ofﬁcer in their frater-
nity, overload every
term, and still manage to
have a fantastic social
life. We callthem super-
achievers and they toler-
ate more than their fair
share of stress. You think
you have it bad, take a
look at these guys:

lications Board.

said Purcell.

cause for celebration, lead to stress albeit positive stress.

Washington and Lee University students do not deal
with such occasions on a regular basis. They affect the
post-college adult population much more frequently.
However, stress does impact student life. The image of
the care-free college student is a myth. Life as a student
can be very taxing for a number of reasons, especially

Associate Dean of Students Anne Schroer-Lamont
believes many stress-related problems result from stu-
dents having difficulty managing time.

Since they are so bright, many students tend to
procrastinate like they did in high school because it was
possible to complete a major assignment in a couple of
hours, according to Schroer-Lamont. In college, stu-
dents try to pull off a major assignment in two hours
when they need four to six hours to complete the

Students have a false belief in their ability to rescue
themselves at the 12th hour, said Schroer-Lamont.

“Work hard, play hard,” W&L’s unofﬁcial motto,
certainly takes a toll. The rigorous academic standards
can cause stress for the diligent student. Given the
increase of the standards for the Dean’s List and ‘Honor
Roll, the pressure will be heightened next term.

The rampant alcohol misuse on campus is also dan-
gerous. Hangovers and binge drinking not only physi-
cally push the student’s body to the limit, dealing with
social ramifications of a raucous drunken episode can

The symptoms of stress are clearly visible:
Trouble sleeping, overeating or poor eating, stomach
cramps, diarrhea, a general feeling of malaise, nausea,
and shortness of ‘breath are tell-tale signs of stress.
Schroer-Lamont said there are over 1400 body
changes to stress ranging from twitching heart muscles

Closing yourself off to friends is a good indicator of
inordinate amounts of stress. Often times those who
suffer from stress will increase their smoking or drink-

“Some days I wake
up and wish I had more
time for fun,”
said Purcell.

Purcell says one can
avoid stressful situations
by learning to “say
no and not raising
your hand.”

hol Review Committee,

and Leadership, Student

House, Health Education
Committee member, and
member of Alpha Phi
Omegaservicefratemity.

“[My activities] don’t
stress me out, it’s when
we have major events in
each that conflict,”
said Jennings.

She says her commit-
ments are draining, but
she makes time for her-
self frequently. Asked
why she keeps herself so
busy, Jennings replied,
“I enjoy myself by see-
ing the good that l’ve
done and that which
l’ve accomplished.”

Jennings admits the
worst thing about her
work is when she
is under appreciated.

She advises other stu-

ing to forget. It’s important to note that everyone
will react differently to stress and looking for
signs of stress can be difﬁcult.

If stress goes untreated the sufferer may begin
to develop more serious physical problems and
diseases. Colitis, constipation, and various self-

destructive nervous ticks like pulling out your

hair can indicate someone under stress.

Schroer-Lamont recalled a story of a room-
mate who had the nervous habit of plucking

entire patches of hair out during stressful events.

While under stress one is also more likely to
catch common illnesses that circulate on campus.
So what leads to stress?
Depression, low self-esteem, and perfection-
ism can cause stress. Critical self-talk can also
have negative consequences. I ’m stupid. I ’m fat.

No one likes me. Why should I try ? I ’m not good

enough. I have no life.

The world would be

better off without me. These are examples of

critical self-talk.

Helping a friend deal with too much stress can
be emotionally exhaustive and you may
need to seek help from one of the

university’s counselors.

Schroer-Lamont said professional attention is

Those students most susceptible to stress-

related problems are those without a good net-
work of support, said Schroer-Lamont. Having a

couple of close friends with whom one can share

stressful events helps to diffuse that stress.

larly impact student life. Knowing the warning

away from his social life,
but gooﬁng off with his

him the most. He be-

KEDEM: Learning to live again, from page 1

understood that his Jewish blood alone
“excluded me from permission to be
alive.”

Despite its misery, the ghetto still
nourished a close-knit community, but
even this did not last long; deportation
to concentration camps caused the
population of Kedem’s community to
dwindle from 20,000 to a few thousand
as trains took away more and more
people.Kedem himself was finally re-
moved, separated from his family and
his past. His name became a number
-—Bl4433— and his past a memory.

Relocated to a concentration camp,
Kedem understood thatonly work could
save him from execution, and secured
a job in the nearby brush factory. .

Living in this and other concentra-
tion camps, “the whole concept” of
Kedem’s life “was to live through to
the next day.”

Concentration camp prisoners re-
ceived at most only 30% of the amount
of food necessary to sustain life, and
Kedem suggests that in the very depri-
vation of food the victims had a “built—
in realization of no future.”

In spite of his seemingdoom, Kedem
soon obtained the possibility of a fu-
ture. A professor in the camp looked
out for the young boy, and added his
name to the Schindler’s List of Holly-
wood fame.“To get on Schindler’s list,”
Kedem explained, “was a struggle to
survive.”

Spending time in a total of six con-
centration camps, Kedem acquired sur-
vival techniques which enabled him to
act without regret, and to live without
feeling.“The control of emotions was
total,” Kedem recalls. “You could not
make any friends, because you lost
them and the loss was too great.”

signs and being able to recognize them in your-
self can help a student successfully combat the
harmful effects of stress. A -

Super-Achievers -- Super Stress?

She says keeping busy
helps her deal with the
harmful effects of stress.
Taking hot showers and
exercising also helps.
What keeps her going is
her desire to accomplish
something in the areas in
which she is interested.

Ryan Connolly
’96: The worst part of
his busy life is when he
doesn’t have control over
his own time. For him,
it’s almost like he is
trapped.

Connolly urges stu-
dents to get involved in
activities they really en-
joy and not those which
only pad the resume.

Associate Dean of
Students Anne Schroer-
I_.amont says that super-
achievers need to learn
to say no. Since they are
very reliable and trust-
worthy, many will call
on them forservice. They
must pick wisely that
which with they will in-
volve themselves.

Schroer-Lamont said
student leaders should
sort through their priori-
ties. Decide which ac-
tivity you most want to
impact and focus. Too
many commitments can
only lead to stress and
early bum-out.

The same ﬁerce attitude with which
Kedem could adapt to a life where a
bullet was always only so far away,
proved destructive to his own charac-
ter. ‘‘It was great equipment for sur-
vival,” Kedem explains, “but terrible if
you stay alive.”

When American troops arrived in
the final camp in which Kedem served,
he was an 11-year old deeply removed
from the concepts of honor and love.

For nearly the next fifty years,
Kedem tried to forget his years as Nazi
prisoner. The chance for education in
a place far from his childhood years
was irresistable to Kedem, and he en-
rolled at Oxford, graduating with a
degree in engineering.

Kedem became a successful engi-
neer, eventually moving to Israel with
his wife and coordinating such projects
as the construction of an airﬁeld on Mt.

Sinai. Kedem also has established
himself as a creative ﬁlm director.

Yet Kedem remained silent on his
past. “I saw it not in color, not in black-
and-white, but in total darkness,” a
story “not to be shared.” .

Only a phone call from Hollywood
director/producer Steven Spielberg
could break Kedem’s silence.

In cooperating with him on the ﬁlm
Schindler ’s List, offering not only his-
torical but technical support, Kedem

began to connect himselfwith his past. .

He has now reconciled himself with
the past, even on a spiritual level.
Kedem has come to accept why such a
series of events happened to him, con-

experience and survives to be a voice __

caust.”

From Dionne Warwick to Dave Matthews

By CELESTE RASMUSSEN
Phi Staff Member

When drunk and trouncing through the mud at Zollman’s,
you’ve probably never wondered why such a place would
exist. A “party barn” like Zollman’s seems as logical and
familiar to the W&L social experience as fraternity houses
and Fancy Dress. However, considering the almost 250
years of W&L history, Zollman’s is a tradition that is rooted
in the relatively recent past.

According to the Spring 1993 edition of the W&L
Alumni Magazine, the pavilion has been in existence since
1964, when original owner Ralph Zollman built a simple
roof to cover his family during their reunions. Soon after,
perhaps attracted to the rustic, out-of the way setting of
Buffalo Creek, Zollman’s was discovered by W&L stu-
dents.

Needless to say, the pavilion was soon radically trans-
formed. According to the article, between 1964 and 1970,
increased student response led to the building of a large
stage, the installation of booths and the placement of the
large stone fireplace in the back.

Indeed, partying at Zollman’s has become an experience.
lt is an exercise in group behavior on the large-scale; for the
parties are always big and the music always loud.

However, many people are quick to point out the down-
sides to such a place. Particularly in the winter months,
Zollman’s can be, perhaps, a bit too rustic. Furthermore,
cramped, out house-style bathrooms do little to help the
experience.

As freshman Helen Kim simply puts it, “The bathrooms
stink, and it’s too cold to go there regularly.” When asked
about Zollman’s, another freshman woman commented,

“l’ve been there twice. The first time I was sober and had a
horrible time. The second time I was drunk and had a great

time.” As another person added, “Yeah, if you drink, you

don’t mind the odor.”

The bathroom situation at Zollman’s hasn’t always been
so bad, though. According to the Alumni magazine, there
were nice bathrooms with hot and cold running water at one
point, but they were rendered unserviceable by repeated use.
Other students have a more favorible opinion. In the words
of Junior Richard Weaver, "Zollman’s? No shoes, no shirt,
no problem!"

No matter what a person thinks about Zollman’s, how-
ever, there does seem to be a basic consensus on the place:
the more drunk you are, the more fun you have.

So what is the mystique behind Zollman’s? Besides the
picturesque setting there are many things the pavilion has to
offer. .

For one thing it is practically immune from the noise
ordinances of Lexington’s’s finest. Furthermore, it is rela-
tively inexpensive and clean—up is included in the price.

So, despite the inconveniences, such as bathrooms and
finding sober drivers to brave the twisty Virginia roads
leading there, Zollman’s has proved itself worthy to the
college age set.

Waynlee Zollman, the current owner, is continuing the
tradition started by his father. Present at every party because
of his liability insurance, he comments in the W&L Alumni
Magazine article that he enjoys getting to know the students.
Both he and his father have seen many things over the past
3 decades.

However, for a place that has hosted such diverse musi-
cal groups that span the spectrum form Dionne Warwick to
Dave Matthews and has crowded in almost 30 years of
students and alumni, one thing will always remain the same:
W&L students have a grand social tradition and Zollman’s
is an integral part of it.

Thursday night is a big television night at W&L. l have known students to
schedule “Mad About You,” “Seinfield,” and “ER” into their lives more regularly

‘ than English papers and math sets. Going all the way back to “Cheers,” Thursday
nights have always been there to lighten up life a little bit.

The hit sitcom “Mad About You” has a wide following of romantic fools who
enjoy laughing at the business of love and marriage. Paul Reiser, television
veteran of such shows as “My Two Dads” plays Paul, the other half of Jamie, in
“Mad About You.”

Paul Reiser is one of the new generation of comedians who has made the
successful transition from stand up to sitcom. Following the lead of others like
Jerry Seinfield, Reiser also recently published Couplehood, a book on his
humorous insights to dating and marriage.

Unlike many sitcom comedians, Reiser also made it to the big screen, most

recently in Bye Bye Love. lt is the story of three divorced dads and their
relationships with theri children, and ex-wives. Bye Bye Love also stars Randy
Quaid Matthew Modin and Janeane Garofalo. Reiser also had a bit part in
Beverly Hills Cop and in Aliens.

For the faithful followers of his Thursday night sitcom, “Mad About You”
many of Reiser’s comments and critique in Couplehood will sound familiar.
Reiser’s inspiration forthe show, as well as this book are based on his relationship
with his wife Paula.

Similar to Jerry Seinfield’sSeinlanguage,chapters seem to be more similar to’
a set ofjokes and experiences one would give on “An Evening at the lmprov.”.

Reiser has his own style of humor, and it shows through clearly in his book;
Couplehood, and in his character Paul on “Mad About You.” '

Be forewarned, this book does not begin on page one, but rather page 145.
Reiser loves being smack in the middle ofthe book. As he sees it, “Pages behind
me, pages ahead of me. lt’s too overwhelming to know there’s so much left and
you’re only on page eight.” . 7-

manner. For avid fans of. “Mad About .You,”,Reiser’s voice seems narrate the

The chapters are arranged in a semblance of sticky encounters couples musi

Scantily clad Scotsmen

 

Rob Roy — ll 1/2

Rememberlastfall’sFranken—
stein, with Robert De Niro and
Kenneth Branagh? Expectations
were very high forthat film — and
when it didn’t quite live up, it
seemed like a tremendous let
down, even though it was an OK
film. Rob Roy is in the same fix.

Robert Roy McGregor (Liam
Neeson) is the head ofa small but
proud clan of Scotsmen, who
have fallen under the control of
an annoyingly effeminate En-
glishman, the Marquis of
Montrose (John Hurt).
McGregor’s clan is having a
tough time ofit in the early eigh-
teenth—century, and survival from
one winter to the next is never
assured.

So Rob Roy hatches a plan to
borrow money from the Mar-
quis, buy some cattle with it, and
sell them for a tremendous profit,
thereby ensuring the clan’s sur-
vival for a few more years at
least. But into the middle of this
tidy little scheme jumps a bas-
tard being housed by the Mar-
quis, Archibald Cunningham
(Tim Roth).

Theresultingconﬂictbetween
Cunningham and Rob Roy pulls
in Mary McGregor (Jessica
Lange), Rob’s wife, as well as
the Duke of Argyll (Andrew
Keir), an opponent of the Mar-
quis.

The basic subject matter,
plot, and action of this ﬁlm is
one of its strongestpoints. The
Scottish people have a rich and
robust culture which lends itself
very well to a heroic film. The
misty, rolling Scottish High-
lands and the ancient stone
castles all look perfect in a
sweeping historical fiction.

Likewise, the supporting act-
ing is fantastic throughout. Tim
Roth (Reserv0irDogs, Pulp Fic-
tion) is absolutely brilliant as
the sneering, underhanded
Cunningham, bringing a very
believable thoroughness to his
character’s evil. Similarly good
are Eric Stoltz (Pulp Fiction,
Mask) as Rob Roy’s right-hand
man and John Hurt (Alien) as
the unjust Marquis.

So it is quite surprising that
theworstactinginthefilmcome
from its two leads, Liam Neeson
and Jessica Lange. Neeson won
great reviews for his role as
Oskar Schindler in last year’s
blockbusterSchindler ’sList, but
he was perhaps a bad choice for
this role. He has a sort of hu-
manity about him that makes
him more of an ordinary Joe
than a folk legend.

Jessica Lange was an even
greater disappointment. The
two-time Oscar winner (Tootsie
and this past year for Blue Sky)
forges through her lines like a

ship through choppy waters. I
know the eighteenth-century and
two children must be hard on a
woman, but she looks way too
old for this role.

And in many ways the script
is the problem. Little known

screen-writer Alan Sharp has‘

done a poor job, especially when
he puts words in the mouths of
the two leads.

Liam Neeson finds himself
speaking about honor in every
other sentence, usually in tired
phrases like “Honor is the gift
men give to themselves.” Simi-
larly, instead of the powerful,
sensual Jessica Lange we nor-
mally get, we are given someone
more akin to a made-for-TV Sally
Field role~herstrength andstub-
bomness seem only a facade, as
if she can merely out-bluff the
English. '

ln another similarity to
Branagh’s Frankenstein, there
seems to be an obsession in Rob
Roy with historical accuracy —

no one’s hair ever looks clean, ,

people are up—front about using
chamber-pots, and the love

scenes are positively earthy. That
might be fine for a PBS docu-
mentary, but heroes, especially
down-to-earth ones like Neeson,
have no business being histori-
cally accurate.

Director Michael Caton-
Jones, best known for Memphis
Belle, does a mediocre job with
this picture. The action scenes,
which are reasonably-well cho-
reographed, need a more re-
strained hand in the camera-work.
Some scenes get way out-of-
hand, such as the river escape
sequence, which drags on with
no development, reducing the
tension and excitement that
should be there.

Essentially, this film could
have been much better. With a
better script, some slightly better
direction, and a glossier, more
expensive production, this film
could have really knocked our
socks off. Instead, it just sort of
pulls them off a few inches at a
time. Don’t rush out to see Rob
Roy, but it wouldn’t be a com-
plete waste of money either.

‘Contract with America’ does not add up

 
 
  

MATTHEW
GRAVES, ’98

The “Contract with America” has
had unbelievable success in the House
of Representatives. Nine of the ten
points of the plan have been covered
and passed in the form of 30 bills. The
Republican juggernaut has been fu-
eled by the overwhelmingvictory that
the party had last November during
the elections. Looking back, on the
elections with 20/20 hindsight, how
could the Republican Party not win?
They promised to attempt to pass
bills which would cut taxes, increase
the size of the military and balance
the budget without cutting social se-
curity. Who wouldn’t want to see all
of these promises turned into law, if
they were economically feasible?
Almost everyone would probably
support these contentions. So the ques-
tion becomes, are these proposals
economically feasible?

I believe (and the numbers support
me) that these proposals are economi-
cally impossible. Let me explain.

In 1993, the federal government
collected roughly 1,154 billion dol-

lars and it spent 1,408 billion dol-
lars. If the Balanced Budget Amend-
ment would have been signed into
law, it would have required that the
federal government would only

touching Social Security, which costs
approximately 305 billion dollars.

interest on the national debt, which is

lunch programs and Affirmative Ac-
tion programs. Next they promised
to increase funding to the military,
which already costs roughly 291 bil-
lion dollars. Finally, when the Re-
publicans said that they would at-
tempt to balance the budget, many of

taxes. The num- icald (131 billion
ber they decided dollars) is unlikely
on was roughly to get cut, this fur-
190 billion dol- ther reduces the

money to a mere 38 billion dollars.
That money would have to fund In-
come Security (which in 1993 cost
208 billion by itself!), education (yes,
this is where the money for the grants
which many of you have comes from),
energy, agriculture, national resources
and transportation, just to name a few

programs.

The problem with the “Contract
with America” is that it is too good to
be true. The Republicans want to have
their cake and eat it, too. It is ﬁscally
impossible to increase spending, re-
duce taxes, and take any serious action
on the deficit. Even the most strident
of supply-side economists would have
to admit that decreasing the budget by
500 billion dollars without touching
the military or Social Security would
be extremely difficult, even with the
spending and investment that a 190
billion-dollar tax cut might cause.
There would be a better chance of
Newt Gingrich walking across the
Potomac barefoot that of his party
balancing the budget under these con-
ditions.

In a time when the country needs
ﬁscal responsibility, what we are get-
ting from the majority party is ﬁnan-
cial gimmickry and shameless, hol-
low promises. This is a time when the
country needs its leaders to say that we
must mend our ways. The government
should be saying that the buck stops
here, and it is time that we pay for the
ﬁnancial mistakes that were made by
both parties in the past. For, in the end,
as usual, the taxpayers will be the ones
who will have to bail out the govem-
ment, and the longer we wait, the more
it will cost.

Electric Kool-Aid Hypocrite Acid Test

THE FAR MIDDLE
Alex Christensen

This week saw the “public lynching” (it’s cool
when this happens to black nominees, first, because
there are black nominees and second, because you
can call it a “public lynching” and everybody will
get all quiet and somber) of yet another nominee for
a top federal position. Henry Foster has been de-
nounced, defamed and denigrated in such mean-
spirited ways that no apology or excuse will ever be
able to repair the damage done to his reputation.

Sound familiar?

That’s right. The same people who got all riled
up over the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill ﬂap are
now jumping all over Dr. Foster, apparently be-
cause they would now like to become President.
(This means you Bob Dole, and you too, Phil
Gramm. Behaving irresponsibly is no way to ingra-
tiate yourself with most voters.)

Dr. Foster’s crime? When asked about how
many abortions he had performed during his entire
three-decade career as a medical educator and ob-
stetrician/gynecologist, Dr. Foster, as he said dur-
ing his hearings, “answered based on my memory
without reviewing the record....But it was an honest
mistake. I am a doctor. I had never experienced
anything like the media scrutiny that I attracted
following my nomination. In my desire to provide
instant answers to a barrage of questions coming at
me, I spoke without having all of the facts at
my disposal...” _

His mistake was to indicate that he had per-
formed about 14 abortions. The record, when re-
viewed, revealed that he had actually performed
39. They were all performed upon his longtime
patients in a hospital for the health of the women
involved. This is not a crime. This is not immoral.
This is the practice of medicine, and those who do
not understand it should not be sitting in judgment
of it. '

While Judge Thomas was investigated for inci-
dents, true or not, for which there were actual
eyewitnesses, Dr. Foster is being punished and
humiliated in a similar way for what amounts to no
more than the moral equivalent of a typo.

Now I would like to reveal why I think the Anita
Hill incident was the best thing that could have
happened to Clarence Thomas. Hopefully, this will
shed some light on Dr. Foster’s situation as well.

You see, when Judge Thomas came up before the
Senate, his legal experience included three and a half
years as an assistant attorney general in Missouri,
some time as cousel to Monsanto, Inc., being an aide
to Senator John Danforth, service as chairman of the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and 18
months as a judge on the District of Columbia circuit
of the U.S. Court of Appeals. The American Bar
Association rated him as minimally qualiﬁed, and
ranked him last out of all of the people who had been
nominated since 1955, including those who never
served on the Court because they were rejected by the
Senate as unﬁt to serve.

So you see, Anita Hill was the perfect shield for
Clarence Thomas’s scant qualiﬁcations to actually
serve as a Supreme Court justice. She had some
support for her allegations, but nothing airtight, or
even close. It allowed senators to say that they were
above such squalid ruriiors or accusations, while
dodging the question of his experience. Justice Tho-
mas should get down on his knees every night and
thank God for Anita Hill.

Which brings us to Henry Foster. Let’s hear what

he had to say in his own defense: “I have been a
medical educator for 30 years. In 1972...l had the
good fortune to become the youngest person ever
inducted into the National Academy of Sciences
Institute of Medicine....ln 1973, I was asked to chair
the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at
Meharry [Medical College]. Over the course of
three decades, I have taught hundreds of young men
and women who have gone on to become ﬁne
physicians....I have personally delivered thousands
and thousands of babies....In 1987 I began the I Have
a Future teen pregnancy reduction program in the
housing projects of Nashville, Tennessee....The pro-
gram is working....In 1989 the AMA awarded us
their Adolescent Health Award, and...in 1991 we
had the honor of being selected by President Bush as
one of America’s Thousand Points of Light—-
point 404.”

If Dr. Foster is not surgeon general material, the
ofﬁce should be abolished now.

And any senator who voted to confirm Clarence
Thomas and does not vote to conﬁrm Henry Foster
should be mercilessly ridiculed as a hypocrite.

all around us, for he is everyone who has ever needed
a little help, a little warmth, a little friendship, a little
compassion from those around him.

Yet the sadhu need not, will not suffer. For civili-
zation is marked by the reign of service. After all, it is
the giving of self that forms collective action which
allows wondrous and amazing deeds. it is service
alone that allows heroes to emerge from the masses of
ordinary men. Look at your classmate, the one who
serves as a Big Sister. She is no different from you or
I but behold the look of admiration that greets her
when she arrives for her visit with her “little.” There
is no doubt that she is a hero in the truest sense ofthe
word. And what of the classmate who is a Brother of
Alpha Phi Omega. He carries himself no differently
than you or I and yet his heart burns with a sense of
pride and purpose that outshines the brightest of stars.

worse, for during the ﬁrst state of nature there were no
Uzis, no man-made viruses, no atomic bombs.

Several men bomb a federal building in Oklahoma
City and we fear that society has fallen into a depth
from which it shall never emerge. But look at the
people, the countless hundreds, who actively helped
with the search for the missing among the rubble.
Look at the thousands more who contributed time,
money and supplies so that the survivors might re-
build their lives. And look at the millions more who
prayed that the survivors would press on, despite their
tragedy, and that the perpetrators of the bombing
would be brought to justice. The terrible deeds of the
few cannot, must not overshadow the beautiful and
selﬂess deeds of millions more.

For the reign of service, the age of civilization, is
about each one of us looking beyond our self-inter-
ests, looking to those all around us. it is about all the
races and creeds of humanity joining together with a
common and noble purpose. It is about you and me,
two strangers, two allies, two friends, combining our
efforts to better the world and the people in it.

Letters correction

in the April 28 issue of The Ring-tum Phi, a letter to the editor from
Joseph B. Framptom ran under the headline, “Faculty, administrative
breaches of student autonomy have gone too far.” In the published letter,
the statement should have read, “We students have successfully run our
own student activities for at least the past four years, and we donot need
to be told what to do now.” The mistake was the result of interpolation by
the typist and incomplete proofreading. The Phi apologizes to Joseph B.
Framptom for the error and any confusion it may have caused.

Lax falls to Roanoke in ODAC final

By KEITH GRANT
Phi Staff Writer

All good things must come to
an end. Thus, the careers of six
Generals who participated in
three conference tournament
championships, winning two,
came to an end last Saturday on
the Liberty Hall Fields.

W&L was beaten, 12-7, by
archrival Roanoke College in the
ﬁnal of the Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference women’s la-
crosse tournament.

The Generals had won the
regular season contest, 11-10, to
earn home-ﬁeld for the tourna-
ment. The Maroons, however,
came to Lexington and played a
near-perfect game to earn their
sixth ODAC championship.

Seniors Sarah Aschenbach,
Lindsay Coleman, Dana Cornell,
Meredith Long, Carrie Niederer,
and Nicole Ripken were quite
familiar with the matchup. They

had been a part of six previous
W&L-Roanoke battles. Four of

the contests had been one-goal
Generals victories; two which
decided the regular season cham-

pion and two forthe ODAC tour-
nament championship.

The Generals and Maroons
were ranked 11th and 12th, re-
spectively, entering the game, so
it was unlikely either would earn
a bid to the eight-team NCAA
Division III tournament.

Fittingly, the teams’ eleven
combined seniors would face—off
in the ﬁnale of their careers.

“[bosing] was sad,” said Long,
“but it was the best possible
matchup we could have had.”

Cornell, who assisted on
Long’s ﬁnal goal that had brought
the Generals to within 7-4, said
that after having avenged the
team’s regular season loss to
Lynchburg the previous day, the
Maroons were tops on Washing-
ton and Lee’s hit list.

“We definitely wanted
Roanoke,” Cornell said. ,“We
were so excited to beat
Lynchburg, and Roanoke was the
team we wanted next.”

The Generals had beaten
Lynchburg, 9-4, in Friday ’s semi-
final behind three goals from
Ripken and two goals from
Lorraine Taurassi.

Macon in the other semifinal by
a score of 14-8.

W&Lﬁnished 10-5 forafour-
year 44-18 record. Roanoke
ended the 1995 campaign with a
record of 12-4.

The Generals met Roanoke in
the 1992 and 1993 champion-
ships and won both in two ofthe
most exciting games in W&L
lacrosse history.

In ’92, the Generals came from
a goal behind during the over-
time session for a 10-9 win at
Roanoke,theirﬁrstwineverover
the Maroons.

In ’93, W&L earned the right
to host the ODAC Final Four
with another overtime win at
Roanoke, then took the champi-
onship, 7-6, on (this is the ﬁnal
timeI’lleverwritethis!)Ripken’s
last-second goal. That win earned
W&L its ﬁrst trip to the NCAA
Division III tournament.

On Saturday, the skies were
clear at the Liberty Hall Fields,

though acloud already hung over
W&L as news spread of the death

Men’s tennis ends
10-9 campaign

By JOSHUA HESLINGA
Phi Staff Writer

The W&L men’s tennis team concluded another winning season
Saturday, ending the 1994-95 school year with a 10-9 record.

This year was the first time in eleven years that the team did not
finish at the top ofthe ODAC standings, but the Generals never gave
up in this year’s tournament, which occurred during the weekend of

April 21-22.

The team stayed within reach of a victory until the ﬁnal round,
where they were nudged out by just two points for the team champi-

onship by Lynchburg.

“I think we had some good performances. We’re a little disap-
pointed to let one [ODAC title] slide, but I think we had a respectable
performance, given the number of kids we lost from last year,” head

coach Gary Franke commented.

On the bright side, W&L took three individual position titles, and
each position player advanced to at least the seminﬁnal round.

Junior Ryan Aday gave the Generals their only singles title at 3rd
singles, defeating Lynchburg’s top-seeded player by a ﬁnal count of

6-4, 6-4.

He also combined with fellow junior Clay Richards at 3rd doubles

to win the title at that position.

The Generals’ other position win came at 1st doubles, where
W&L’s top two singles players, juniors Chris MacNaughton and
Jesse Taylor, combined to win it all. '

For his achievements, Aday was named as the Generals’ male

Athlete of the Week last week.

During the ODAC tourney, Aday took revenge on two players he
had lost to during the regular season, where he ended with a record

of 13-11 overall.

Aday also posted a stellar 12-3 regular season record at 2nd

doubles with Richards.

MacNaughton also provided some tournament highlights, despite
going into his 1st singles tournament seeded just sixth.

He defeated the 3rd seed from Hampden-Sydney in three sets, then
knocked off the 2nd seed from Eastern Mennonite to advance to the

tournament ﬁnals.

In the title match, MacNaughton lost a heartbreaker in a 3rd set tie-
breakerto ODAC Playerof the Year Kevin Pendergrast from Guilford.
This past Saturday, the Generals continued their tough schedule,
playing against the Division III defending national champion Wash-

ington College.

W&L looked to finish its season on a winning note by upsetting

the Shoremen on the road.

Unfortunately, Washington College showed their mettle, hand-

ing the Generals a 7-0 defeat.

Nonetheless, the Generals have much to look forward to, since
they return all of their starting lineup for next year.

When asked for his prognosis, Coach Franke added, “We’re
hopeful. We’ve got [Pete] Hammond and [Andy] Horen coming
back from Europe, and maybe we’ll get a few recruits too.

"We’ll have a competitive team next year.”

W&L can only look forward to the Generals’ charge to recapture
the ODAC championship next season.

ber, yet the turnout to support the
Generals was strong.

Roanoke’s fans got to cheer
first as Lisa Franzino netted her
first of two goals six minutes into
the game.

Though W&L junior Cinnie
Logan responded quickly with a
game-tying goal, the Maroons
scored the next three en route to
a 5-2 lead at halftime.

The Generals got close, but
never could get even. Long’s
second-half goal was followed
three minutes later by freshman
Lorraine Taurassi’s ﬁrst of two
goals to cut the score to 7-5.

Roanoke goalie Kathleen
Ostar was outstanding in net the
rest of the way. With the Ma-
roons up by 10-6 with 4:22 left,
Ostar stopped repeated shots by
W&L, including several point-
blank opportunities.

Only freshman Whitney
Parker could ﬁnd the back ofthe
net to make it 10-7 with only
2:32 remaining.

Ostar ﬁnished with 16 saves.
many of them coming in those
ﬁnal minutes. W&L’s Brooke
Glenn was also solid in goal,
stopping 20 shots.

Coleman, Long, and Ripken
scored one goal apiece, while
Roanoke senior Francesca Foord—
Kelcey scored twice, and class-
mate Laurel Krebs pitched in with
two assists.

The goals by Coleman and
Ripken gave each 112 for their
respective careers, leaving them
tied for third on the school’s all-
time list.

Yet, on “senior day” it seemed
that the freshmen who will con-
tinue the rivalry dominated the
scoring. Roanoke’s Ali Ogelsby
had three goals and one assist.
Taurassi, who netted two after
older sister Cheryl left with an
injury in the second-half, and
Parker combined for W&L’s ﬁ-
nal three scores.

Despite the loss, the Generals
are pleased with their season as a
whole, especially after coming
off of last season’s frustrating 8-
7 record.

“It was a pretty positive year,
a good rebuilding year,” said
Cornell. “Overall, we feel good
about the season.”

Washington & Lee will be the
nation’s third seeded team when
the NCAA Division III women’s
tennis championships open up
on Tuesday.

This marksthe second straight
year and the third time since 1991
that the team has earned a trip to
the nationals.

The tournament runs from
May 9 to 15 and is being hosted
this season by nearby Sweet Briar
College. ‘

The Generals (1 8-1)will make
the short trip over the mountain
Tuesday to take on Skidmore
College (14-3) in the
tournament’s opening round at
8:30 AM.

Head coach Cinda Rankin is
excited, yet cautious about the
Generals ﬁrst-round opponent.

“Anyone at this level is
tough,” said Rankin. “We don’t
know much about them, but
they’re young and up-and-com-
1n .”
gW&L’s #1 singles player
Marilyn Baker has previously
faced Skidmore’s top player,
Jamie Levine.

Baker beat Levine, 6-3, 6-0,
in the consolation match of the
Rolex National Championships
this past fall, earning a third-
place finish.

Rankin saidthatbuses willbe

Briar for all Generals’ matches.
The schedule is being coordi-
nated by the W&L Sports Infor-
mation Office (463-8674), but
the bus for Tuesday’s match is
expected to leave at 7:30 AM.

Last year, W&L entered the
tournament as the number-two
team, but was beaten in the
quarterﬁnals by Williams and
ﬁnished sixth.

With a win Tuesday, the Gen-
erals would move on to face the
winner of the Amherst-Sewanee

game on Wednesday.

Amherst (19-1) is the east
region’s number—one team, hav-
ing beaten Williams College ear-
lier in the year.

Sewanee was the Generals’
final opponent before last
month’s Old Dominion Athletic
Conference tournament. W&L
took the match, 5-4, to virtually
secure a top-four seed for the
NCAA tournament.

The five-time defending
ODAC champs look to be on a
collision course for an opportu-
nity to avenge their lone defeat
and meet the nation’s top-seeded
team, Kenyon College (15-2), in
Thursday’s semifinal.

W&L fell to Kenyon, 5-4, in
March while playing without two
of its top singles players.

Freshman Natalia Garcia, the
nation’s 11th-ranked singles
player, was competing for her
native Dominican Republic that
week in the Federation Cup, fe-
male tennis’ equivalence of the
Davis Cup.

The Generals’ ODAC cham-
pion last year at third-singles,
junior Shelley Sunderman, was
injured before the Kenyon match,
and she did not return until late in

Among W&L’s other regular
season opponents in the 14-team
tournament are Emory (W&L
won, 5-4) and previous national
number-one squad, Williams
(W&L won, 7-2). Emory was
one of the two schools to beat
Kenyon this year.

The championship match will
be scheduled for next Friday at
10:00 AM.

A pair of Generals will then
begin play in the singles and
doubles competition. _

Senior Marilyn Baker is
ranked number-five in the coun-
try after posting a 26-3 record.
This is her fourth trip to nation-
als, where she advanced to the
quarterﬁnals in 1993. The three-
time ODAC Player of the Year
finished third in that fall’s Rolex
National Championships.

Garcia will also compete in
singles, in addition to teaming
with Baker in doubles. The duo
with a match record of 22-3 is
ranked third'in the nation, and
they placed third at the Rolex
Championships.

The seedings for both singles
and doubles will be announced

next week.

of W&L Alumni and W&L Law
Alumni Associations, a seminar en-
titled by “Alumni College Abroad: Past

istered to participate in this weekend’s
programs as of last Wednesday after-
noon. According to Robert Mish, As-
sociate Director of Alumni Programs,
“a great majority of the alumni are
reunionists.” Undergraduate classes
from 1945, 1950, 1955, 1960, 1965,
and1970 will have individual class re-
unions tomorrow evening at various
locations in Rockbridge County. The
classes of 1975, 1980, 1985, and 1990
will party together at Zollman’s Pavil-
ion with entertainment provided by
Heinsohn & Day and The Voltage
Brothers. In addition to those who
returned for reunions, alumni who serve
on the Alumni Board of Directors re-
turned to campus for meetings this
weekend. Also Mish said “a fairly
substantial number” of younger alumni
have corrre back to campus.

Alumni returned to W&Lthis week-
end for numerous reasons. Alumni
wanted to see their former classmates
and other people who attended W&L.
However, Mish believes the large num-
ber of alumni have returned to campus
this weekend for two other reasons.
First, alumni want to visit with their
former professors because “when you
[alumni] hit five to ten years out [of
college], you want to enjoy your rela-
tionship with the faculty as friends”
explained Mish. Alumni have the op-
portunity to become reacquainted with
their former professors and meet new
faculty at a cocktail party on the Front
Lawn this evening.

Secondly, Mish said that alumni

who attended today’s panel discussion
with W&L undergraduates and law
students got a sense of Washington and
Lee today. Musically inclined stu-
dents who make up Southern Comfort,
Sazeracs’, and JubiLee will display
their talents to the alumni at 8:00 p.m.
this evening in Lee Chapel. Alumni
will have further opportunity to learn
about the W&L of today when min-
gling with the Class of 1995 who have
been invited to the Reunion Dance
featuring Spectrum tonight in the
Warner Center. Mish notes that the
alumni’s desire to learn about life at
W&L today also contributes to the
popularity of fraternity and sorority
cocktail parties held this weekend.
Preparation for the alumni weekend
did not commence with Building and
Grounds tiding up the hill during the
past weeks. The Alumni Ofﬁce began
thinkingaboutthisyear’salumniweek-
end last June. The process started with
the mailing of 3,500 questionnaires to
alumni who have reunions this year
asking them to update their personal
information. “We get a high percent-
age of return, about seventy to seventy-
five percent” said Mish. The Alumni
Ofﬁce utilizes this information to pro-
duce reunion yearbooks which are
available to alumni this weekend. ln
the following months, the Alumni Of-
fice sends out periodic communica-
tions to alumni reminding them of their
upcoming reunions. They also began
to discuss the logistics of this year’s
event with the staffs of Evans Dining

. Alumni welcomed back to campus

from year to year, details like the semi-
nar topics are modified “to keep it
fresh,” says Mish. In March of this
year, registration material for the week-
end was sent out and responses were
received by the Alumni Ofﬁce during
the last two months. According to Mr.
Mish, Buildings and Grounds com-
pleted all of the preparations on cam-
pus before the start of the weekend
because “the less they [alumni, faculty,
and students] notice about logistics,
the more fun they’ll have.”

The only fund raising involved with
Alumni Weekend consists of the
twenty-ﬁfthand ﬁftieth reunionclasses’
campaign for class gifts. For the last
ten years, these reunion classes have
“provided wonderfulfundingsources,”
for things says Mish. Past gifts have
included 2 fellowship for excellence in
teaching and the facade located at the
comer of Washington and Jefferson
Streets. Mr. Mish notes that reunion
classes feel a great deal of pride in
providing these gifts to the university.

In addition to the events geared to
the alumni this weekend,certain events
have been scheduled with the current
student body in mind. Yesterday
evening, the Evans Dining Hall staff
provided a special Alumni Weekend
cook-out for the students. At 6:00 p.m.
this evening, the band Allgood will be
appearing on the men’s lacrosse prac-
tice field. The Free Will Savages will
open this concert sponsored by the
Student Activities Board. Beer will be
available to those over twenty-one years

Baccalaureate
lunch changed

By MICHAEL HEWLETT
Phi Associate Editor

Seniors and their families will be
eating out of box lunches instead of the
traditional buffet lunch at this
year’s baccalaureate.

Some seniors think box lunches
are inappropriate for such a
special occasion.

“It doesn’t seem right to me,” said
seniorAdam Plotkin. “lt’s graduation.”

But Director of Special Events and
Guest Relations Rose Gordon said she
decided on box lunches because the
lines at the buffet lunch have become
longer. The buffet lunch, which takes
place on the Stemmons Plaza (the walk-
way from the Commerce School to
beybum Library), used to have six
lines but now has eight.

She became concerned about food
spoilage, insects and elderly people
waiting in lines. She said the student
body is increasing, and seniors are bring
more family members every year. Prob-
lems also occurred when it rained. ln
the past, if it rained, the buffet lunch
had to be moved to the Doremus gym,
and the baccalaureate had to be moved
to the Warner Center. With box lunches,
people can get their food and eat in the
gym or somewhere else, she explained.
Eliminating the
buffet would
make the line go
quicker, Gordon
said.

“We’re try-
ing to speed up
the process and
keep the food
fresher,”

A n d r e w

Schneider, who
collected signa-
tures for a peti-
tion, disagreed.
“I thought box
luncheswereout
of sync with cul-
mination of four
years of hard
work and thou-
sands of dollars
in tuition,” he
said. “lt’s like a
take out meal at
a fast food res-
taurant.”

it should be our decision as to what we
want.”

Senior 6 Class Vice-President
Caroline Amason said initially, she
was bothered about the idea, but after
talkingwihtGordon and seeingthe box
lunch, she has no problem with it. She
explained that Gordon only wants to
improve baccalaureate -—- not take any-
thing specifal from it.

“The thingthat matters is that you’re
eating with your family not what kind
of plate you’re eating off.”

Having box lunches would mean
more work for the catering services,
and she wondered how would the din-
ing services would ﬁgure out the num-
ber of box lunches to prepare.

Gordon argued that the box lunches
are not tacky.

“My job is to make things more
attractive,” he said. “l wouldn’t want to
cheapen [the lunch] in any way.” ‘

The box would have a gold W&L
seal with a blue ribbon. The box lunch
will have two croissant sandwiches,
one with baked ham and one with three
cheeses for vegetarians. Sliced toma-
toes, individual mayonnaise/mustard,

pasta salad, fresh strawberries with
whipped cream and large gourmet
cookies would also be included.

K To ﬁgure out how many box lunches

‘to prepare," Gordon went back three

years and ﬁg-
ured out how
many people
were served at
previousbuffet
lunches. She
said the ratio
was one to six.
She took how-
ever many se-
niors who will
graduate this
year, multi-
plied that num-
ber by six and
added a five
percent over-
run (an overes-
timation).

Honor System has long, diverse history

By STEPHEN WILLIARD
Phi’ Staff Wﬁter

The Honor System at
Washington and Lee is
probably the most val-
ued part of the school’s
long tradition.

While the principles
of honor and trust can be
viewed in a multitude of
locales and situations all
over campus, the puni-
tive side of the system
normally operates in the
background—-an under-
stood necessity brought
about by the strict code
of conduct set down for

members of the W&L
community.

However, this year, a
glut of closed trial con-
victions and the accom-
panying student body
notices have brought ev-
ery aspect of the Honor
System into the forefront
of student attention. An
open trial— the school’s
first in three years— and
three withdrawals after
being charged with honor
violations have also
served to magnify the
role of the Honor System
in everyday student life.

The Honor System

was introduced by Rob-
ert E. Lee during his ten-
ure as president of the
institution.

The EC’s duties were

The first recorded trial
occurred in 1906.

Early on, the system
was much more strict

guilty themselves. Also,
students did not have the

This weekend alumni
will have the chance to
help Habitat for Human-
ity and win valuable
prizes. Today from 12:00
to 5:00 and tomorrow
from 10:00 to5:00 Habi-
tat will be selling rafﬂe
tickets in the area be-
tween Newcomb Hall
and the Co-op. Habitat
president and founder
Francie Cohen says the
fundraiser is for alumni
weekend, but that any-
one can buy tickets.

Prizes include a bottle
of wine from Harb’s,
chocolates, gift certifi-
cates to The Palm’s, and
an autographed picture
of Muhammed Ali. The
grand prize is a week for

two at the Alumni Col-
lege summer program,
worth $1000. In a strange

‘ twist of fate, Cohen’s

parents won the Alumni
weekend package last
year. Cohen says, “lt’s
an absolute blast.” \
Habitat for Humanity
will also be selling t-
shirts at University
Sportswear and in front
of the Co-op. Shirts are
$12 or $10 with the pur-
chase of a rafﬂe ticket.
The goal of the Wash-
ington and Lee chapter
of Habitat for Humanity
is, “to eliminate substan-
dard housing,” according
to Cohen. She also said
that Habitat wants, “For
every graduating class to
give something back to
Lexington” by building
a house. The money
raised this weekend will

go to the fund for the
junior class’s house.

The class of 199S’s
house is almost com-
pleted. Cohen said the
house will go to a single
mother of two teenagers,
one of who has cerebral
palsy and is mentally
handicapped. In addition
to building the house,
Habitat wants to give the
family a washer and
dryer. Cohen said that
since the mother is the
family’s sole source of
income they want “to
help her as much as pos-
sible.”

Habitat for Humanity
welcomes donations,
both monetary and mate-
rial. “If anyone could
donate cabinets, fumi-
ture, or something like
that, it would really help
us a lot,” said Cohen.

On Tuesday, President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin
joined other world leaders in celebrating the ﬁftieth anniversary of V-E
Day, marking the victory of the Allies over Nazi Germany. Activities
included a parade in Red Square, the opening of a war museum, and a
reception in the Kremlin. All participants were honoring the 27 million
people killed during World War II.

Outbreak in Zaire

Representatives of the World Health Organization have reported that as
many as 50 recent deaths in Zaire can be attributed to a hemorrhagic fever.
This outbreak may have been caused by the deadly Ebola virus. The areas
surrounding Kikuit have been quarantined by the Zairian government.
WHO is working with representatives from the Center for Disease Control
and the Pasteur Institute to determine which virus caused the outbreak
which started April 10. Ebola kills 90 percent of those who contract it. It
produces fever, vomiting, and hemorrhaging as body tissues dissolve. It is
contracted through close contact, like the exchange of bodily ﬂuids. At this
time, there is no known vaccine or cure.

UN troops face students in
Haiti

On Tuesday, United Nations peacekeeping troops had to rush a crowd
of students to break up a brawl over public teachers’ salaries. The troops
intervened after Haitian police, after tear gassing the crowd for four hours,
failed to control the rock throwing students. About 2 police officers and 25
students were injured by ﬂying rocks or were overcome by the tear gas.
Police arrested several students.

Domenici plan offers spend-

Senate Republicans presented a plan to balance the budget by 2002 on
Tuesday. The seven-year plan, as proposed by Senate Budget Committee
Chairman Pete V. Domenici (R-NM.) includes reduced spending for
Medicare, Medicaid, foreign aid, defense, and hundreds of other domestic
programs. Domenici’s plan would save nearly $1 trillion and eliminate the
Commerce Department and the Interstate Commerce Commission, as well
as more that 100 other federal programs and agencies. The plan calls for
phasing out funding for mass transit programs, reducing funding for the
National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the
Humani,ti_es,_and ending President Clinton’s national service program.

Oklahoma investigation con-

In recent weeks, FBI agents have questioned Jennifer Lynn McVeigh,
21, sister of Oklahoma City bombing suspect Timothy James McVeigh.
She has had to explain her activities and what she knows about her brother’s
movements and alliances with anti—govemment groups. FBI agents now
want McVeigh’s sister to take a polygraph test. A letter that_Timothy
McVeigh wrote to his sister was taken from the car he was driving at the
time of his arrest. In the letter, the suspect warned his sister that FBI agents
may be tapping her phone.

Debate on Clean Water Act
revision

On Wednesday, the House opened debate on the controversial rewrite
of the Clean Water Act. The original 974 act gives the Environmental
Protection Agency the authority to restrict the levels of pollutants that
industries and municipal authorities can put into bodies of water. The act
also provides the basis for federal agencies to preserve wetlands. The
revised version abolishes some of the pollution restrictions and includes
waivers exempting some industries from requirement to pretreat waste
water before discharging it as long as it is later treated in public facilities.
The most controversial revision would establish a new, narrow definition
of what constitutes a wetland. This new definition may reduce the amount

of land of land in the U.S. eligible for protection as wetlands by 50 to 70
percent.

Boy overlooked on school bus

On Monday afternoon, eight year old Joey Coleman was found asleep
in his school bus forty five minutes after the driver had parked and left the
bus in the lot upon completing his route. Transportation ofﬁcials were
alerted by Sandra Coleman after her son did not arrive home from Fishburn
Park Elementary School. Chauncey Logan, transportation director for the
school, said that the bus driver failed to go through a check list every driver
is supposed to go through when he ﬁnishes a route, including looking to see
if there are any children left on the bus. Logan is considering disciplinary
action in the case.

Roanoke police want new pay
scale

The Roanoke County police officers asked the Board of Supervisors to
consider a proposal which would ﬁx pay inequities within the department
and make county officers’ salaries competitive with those in other areas.
The $315,914 proposal would be used to give 105 officers pay increases to
address current inequities. The proposal also calls for new police officers
to be hired at the same starting salary, regardless of experience or educa-
tion. The Board of Supervisors gave the proposal a very “lukewarm”
reception at their Tuesday afternoon session.

ARC reviews alcohol use and abuse

By BETHANY BAUMAN
Phi Staff Writer

“Work hard, play hard.” Washing-
ton and Lee’s unofficial motto coupled
with a long standing tradition of drink-
ing, can give rise to excessive, high risk
behavior. Last year’s North Carolina
Governors Institute Survey prompted
the Student Health Committee, under
the leadership of Dean of Students David
Howison, to ad-
dress the issue of ’
alcohol use at
W&L. Because its
members felt that
they did not have
thetime to give the
issue adequate at-
tention, they
formed a subcom-
mittee dedicated
to further investi-
gation.

The Alcohol
Review Commit-
tee kicked off its
activity withadin-
ner for 50 student
leaders and sev-
eral administra-
tors in January. In this forum, students
made a general assessment of the alco-
hol use at W&L. From there, the ARC

 

tivities Coordinator Michelle
Richardson and Director of Security
Mike Young, meet weekly. The stu-
dent members come from a cross sec-
tion ofthe university, with representa-
tives from Student Athlete Mentors,
Sexual Awareness Group Educators,
Student Activities Board, the dorm
counselors, the resident assistants, law
students, transfer students, and under-
graduate classes. Members are ap-
pointed and approved by the ARC.
The diversity of its members allows
the committee to
gather many dif-
ferent perspec-
tives on drinking
at W&L.

Many rumors
have been circu-
lated about the in-
tentions of the
ARC. The com-
mittee does not
wish to make or
review university
policy on alcohol.
Members do not
want to card at fra-
ternity parties,
make all social
functions dry, or
ban drinking alto-
gether. Instead, the ARC hopes, in the
long run, to provide students with al-
ternatives to typical fraternity activi-
ties. The ARC is not

alternatives, though.

“We’re trying to create an atmo-
sphere where people at W&L, if they
want to, can drink responsibly...and
have a good time with alcohol, but not
have the adverse consequences of high-
risk drinking,” said ARC member
Kim Stoner.

The ARC recently submitted a pro-
posal list of alternative activities to
Dean Howison. The administration,
however‘, still must discuss the pro-
posal before any official decision
is made.

In addition to promoting low-risk,

 

responsible drinking and formulating
alternative activities, the ARC hopes
to begin an alcohol education program
for freshmen.

In trying to shift the social focus at
W&L away from alcohol, the ARC is
trying to defeat a long standing tradi-
tion. The committee is therefore fo-
cusing on long range planning and
change that hopes to reduce the level of
high-risk drinking that W&L students
do both before and after graduation.

Any questions or comments about
the ARC can be directed to Kim Stoner
or Karly Jennings.

Panel remembers Vietnamprots

By BETSY GREEN
Phi Staff Writer

The 1970’s in the United States was an era marked
by student protest. Bob Dylan sang, “The times, they
are a’changin”’ and this sentiment was true even in
the most traditional of places: Washington and Lee
University. The student protest that occurred in May
of 1970 was the topic of
a panel discussion en-

proposing alcohol-free

day by the National Strike Committee, a New Haven
group that asked W&L students to observe a national
strike ofcollege students. From three hundred to four
hundred students attended the rally which promoted
a trip to the University of Virginia to attend an anti-
war rally. Student Jeff Gingold, ‘70 had circulated a
petition to withdraw troops from Cambodia which
was endorsed by the EC.

Richardson said that
the speeches were broad-

titled, “The Strike Move-
ment: Student Activism
and the Vietnam War
Era.” The discussion was
co-sponsored by The
Graham-Lee Washing-
ton Literary Society and
the American Civil Lib-
erties Union. Panelists
featured Professor Brian
Richardson, ‘73, Patrick
Hinely, ‘73, Professor
Mario Pellicciaro, who
taught at W&L at the
time, Fran Lawrence,
who was the president-
elect of the Executive
Committee, and Henry
Sloss, who taught En-
glish at W&Lduringthat
time.
Thepanelistsdetailed
the extraordinary events
that occurred at Wash-
ington and Lee and ex-
plained their feelings at
the time and how the pro-
test affected their lives.
On May 5, 1970, the
war in Vietnam had be-
come a matter of great
concern to the W&L
community. President
Richard Nixon had just
ordered troops into Cam-
bodia. According to
Hinely, “As students, we
had an immediate interest in the draft...it was like
Darth Vader hovering in the background.” But the
concern was more than just personal. Sloss recalls
that, Vietnam. “entered one’s consciousness as a
citizen.” A rally was held in front of Lee Chapel that

the Vietnam era.

Richardson recalls, “A

and when he heard a
speaker say, ‘We’re tired

istration b******* and
we’re not going to take it
anymore.”’ The student
tried to bleep out the of-

ment ending up broad-
casting, “And we’re

The next day, thirty
students picketedclasses
along the colonnade.
Some professors can-
celed classes in honor of
the protest. Many stu-
dents went to the rally at
UVA and were, as Sloss
recalls, “pretty fired up.”

On the following
night between seventy-ﬁve and one hundred stu-
dents met in the Cockpit (now the General Headquar-
ters) to discuss the problems of Indochina and the
protest at Kent State University where four students
were killed. That night the students drafted a pro-

 

 

posal to close W&L and to set up a “Free University”
of lectures and discussion groups about the war.
Hinely said that shutting down “a Southern, conser-
vative school like W&L would have really made a
statement.” Some students wanted the option to leave
school to protest in Washington, DC.

In a separate meeting, the faculty met to discuss a
proposal to give students who chose not to attend
class a grade of Incomplete, provided all work be
made up by September 30. Pellicciaro said the idea
made sense to him. “When students were sick, we’d
give them Incompletes, and everyone was kind of
sick at the time.” Pellicciaro remembers that Univer-
sity president Robert Huntley was, “not warm to the
idea,” but he “lost the argument” and the proposal
was approved by the faculty. Pellicciaro believes
offering incompletes was, “a very gentile solution to
the strike.”

On May 10, 1970, a memorial service was held for
the students killed at Kent State. The EC voted to
endorse the student proposal to cancel Spring Term
classes. The next day, 96.5% ofthe students voted on
the proposal. 80.7% of them voted in favor of cancel-
ing classes. The faculty did not approve the proposal
and instead implemented their plan to allow
incompletes.

Vandalism attempted
in Washington Hall

By ANNE E. ALVORD
P/ii News Editor

Early Tuesday morning, an attempt at vandalism
was made in Washington Hall. Around 3:00 a.m., a
custodian came in to the building and heard an
unidentified number ofpeople, whovwere apparently
scared away by the custodian’s arrival.

Soon after, three cans of paint, a mop, which was
cut off, apparently for use as a brush, and a sign
reading “We don’t give a s*** about US News and
World Report.” The sign was signed “The
Student Jihad”.

Director of Security Mike Young reports that the
vandals appeared to be trying to gain access to the
roof of the building.

In response to the vandalism attempt, Young says
“We’re doing our best to make sure they don’t get in
[to Washington Hall].”

Richardson, Lawrence, and Hinely

this breach of student autonomy.
Lawrence remembers that students felt
“a sense of betrayal” when the faculty
disregarded the proposal that had been

The panelists all consider May of
1970 to be one of the most important
times of their lives. Lawrence said the
protest was a time of “personal awak-

Hinely agreed
and stated that

he would speak out against the war. He
agreed and joked that, “I was probably

Obituary

On May 1, Mrs. Anne S. Zeigler, a long-time secretary to

Deans of the Commerce School, passed away after a long
illness.
‘l Zeigler had been with Washington and Lee since April
1970. She was well known to many students, especially
those of the C-School. A compassionate, cheerful person,
she had been most helpful to the faculty, staff, and students
over the years.

The funeral service was conducted on May 4, followed by
burial in Stonewall Jackson Cemetary.

4 She is survived by a daughter, granddaughter, and her
mother.

The Ring-tum Phi, May 12, 1995

By CELESTE RAsMUssEN
Phi Staff Writer

In a school whose motto translates
to “not unmindful of the future,” a
recycling program would seem to be a
logical endeavor. Unfortunately, there
are only limited recycling opportuni-
ties on the W&L campus. This may
soon change, for over the past few
years campus-wide recycling has
gained increased support amongst stu-
dents and faculty alike.

The recycling question was first
addressed by members of the Outing
Club about four years ago when white
paper recycling was started on the Hill.

 

Due to the success of this program, the
Outing Club, in conjunction with the
Freshman Leadership Council, has in-
stituted a petition calling for an expan-
sion of the program currently on cam-
pus. Freshmen Kate Giese, Ramey
Harris, Bjomen duPont, and Jenny Wil-
liams have been particularly active in
the spread of the petition, as well as
Outing Club advisor Kirk Follo. The
petition calls for an expansion in “the
recycling program to include items such
as glass, plastic, and newspaper,” as
well as increased “accessibility of re-
cycling locations for the university
community.”

According to Kate Giese, the peti-
tion currently has around 750 signa-
tures on it. Organizers hope to get at

least 1000 signatures before they write
a cover letter and present it to presi-
dent-elect Elrod for consideration. So
far, most of the signatures have been
collected outside of the Co-op and in
the Dining Hall; however, they soon
hope to reach people that do not fre-
quent these areas.

W&L has had recycling programs
in the past, but they have not had much
success. According to Ramey Harris,
one program where students collected
the recyclables failed because of the
time burdens involved. Furthermore,
ﬁre codes in the dorms prohibit bins
from being placed in the hallways. The
supporters of the petition hope that
B&G would run the program, but this
brings up logistical questions such as

the cost of buying bins and potentially
hiring a new employee.

However, according to Harris, once
the initial planning is completed, “re-
cycling is not hard to do.” She suggests
that drums could be placed in the Co-
op, dorms, and D-Hall for the collec-
tion of plastic, aluminum, and other
recyclables. Another suggestion, as
stated in a preliminary report by the
Outing Club, is to start a recycling
center near Gaines or Doremus. Such a
center would be accessible both to stu-
dents who live off campus and those
who drive to school.

The report also states that there are
many steps that could be taken in the
interim to help cut down on waste, such
as the elimination of styrofoam cups

and bowls on campus dining facilities
and the switch, by the individual aca-
demic departments, to recycled Xerox
paper. There is also a recycling center
maintained by Rockbridge Regional
Solid Waste Management in town.
However, since it is located behind
Kroger Grocery Store, it is not
accessable to students who don’t have
access to a car.

Many groups of students, such as
fraternity houses and Gaines residents,
have also started their own recycling
programs. For students interested in
recycling tips, the Outing Club and the
Ofﬁce of Residence life has published
a pamphlet with several useful tips.

As Kate Giese notes, the absence of
a recycling program puts W&L behind

other schools. She was “shocked” when
she visited campus and saw no recy-
cling effort. She says that “every other
college has one and this is an embar-
rassment to W&L.” Students seem to
be united behind the establishment of a
program, though.

As Follo states, “This is not a battle
between conservative and liberal stu-
dents.” Because of this enthusiastic
student response and the increased fac-
ulty interest, it is probable that a pro-
gram will at least be looked into.

However, as the OutingClub mem-
bers remind us, the ﬁght is far from
over. They encourage students to sign
the petition and attend their meetings if
interested in helping to expand recy-
cling opportunities on campus.

Sister Souljah is in your face
and ain't taking No Disrespect

Sister Souljah

‘-3 ;,‘ No Disrespect

      
 
 

  

By MICHAEL HEWLETT
Phi Associate Editor

Sister Souljah has made a name for herself as an ABF (angry black female).
President Clinton catapulted her name into public infamy when he criticized her
remarks during the Dos Angeles riots. She said if blacks killed blacks all year,
then why not have a week to kill white people, but Clinton took her statement out
of context. Apparently, she was simply expressing the sentiment of some of the
rioters. Some political analysts argued that Clinton used his criticism of Souljah
as a strategy to keep his white supporters. In 1992, her rap album, 360 Degrees
of Power, and video, “Slavery’s Back in Effect,” plus her many appearances on
talk shows placed her “ no b.s.” voice of black rage in the American spotlight.
Now readers can figure why she is so angry by picking up her first
book, No Disrespect.

And no disrespect does she mean as she takes her readers into a no-holds
barred view of her life and her thoughts right from the beginning:

‘‘I never said I was an angel. Nor am I innocent or holy like the Virgin Mary.
What I am is natural and serious and as sensitive as an open nerve on an ice cube.”

Divided into chapters named after people who have inﬂuenced her life, she
starts with her life in the Bronx in New York. Her father, once a hard-working
man with a grand heart, suffers from epilepsy and loses his job and his will to live.
Her mother, trying to raise her children on her own, has men coming in and out
of Souljah’s eyes as she grows up. Unemployed men litter the streets and make
babies without taking any responsibility while welfare makes fools out
of its recipients.

Souljah reads voraciously and makes it to Rutgers University in New Jersey.
As she awakens politically, she also awakens emotionally and sexually.

Reading books opens her up to her black history and culture. At the same time,
she enters into a serious relationship with a senior political science and history
major. Throughout the novel she gets involved with other men, including a
married man and a drug dealer. While she’s at it, she befriends a lesbian and a
woman who has a knack ofjuggling two to three men at a time (like the woman
in Spike Lee’s She’s Gotta Have It).

Did I like this book? Yes. Did I agree with everything in it? No. ljust couldn’t
put it down. She comes to you straight and uncensored. Her honesty stuck me.
She exposes parts of her life that are often embarrassing. I argued with her.
Sometimes I wanted to applaud her courage and other times I wanted to scream
at her stupidity. She has the idea that black women should openly share their men
because of the shortage of black men. Mmmm. I don’t think so. It sure as hell
doesn’t make any sense to me. But other things spoke to me; her rage spoke to me;

I her intellect spoke to me; her rapid-ﬁre thoughts spoke to me. Souljah made me

think about things that are uncomfortable, things that are real, things that don’t
put a smile on your face but a little tear in your eye.

More impor-
tantly, her story
never bored me.
It made me angry;
it made me sad; it
made me laugh; it
did all of these
things. At times, I
thought she was
too militant and
too narrow-
minded and
sometimes infuri-
ating. I certainly
got sick and tired
of passages
like this:

“He looked
into my eyes and I
could feel how
much he liked me
and how attracted
he was. His eyes
lowered from my
eyes and he swept
by my breasts, my
newly achieved
firm waistline,
and landed on my
mother-of-the-
world hips...She
knew she couldn’t
ﬁght the African
body and after I
was sure Nathan
had seen it all, I
sat down.”

In almost ev-
ery chapter, she
devotes a paragraph or two to how drooling-to-the-ground beautiful she is. I’m
not saying she’s ugly, but she is deﬁnitely not all that. Souljah has too big an ego.
I have no problem with self-confidence, but Souljah comes off as arrogant. And
it’s her arrogance that sometimes weakens the book.

But I knew where she stood and where she was coming from. Whether you
agree with her or not, she serves notice on what she thinks on relationships,
politics and race. Above all, she writes what she means and what she thinks with
malice to no one and no disrespect.

Muriel’s Weddirzg—uﬁri‘ri‘t*

The typical date movie is long on ﬂuff and short on
substance. Movie-makers seem afraid that serious issues
would ruin the light-hearted romance their movies promise
to deliver. Luckily, the makers of this ﬁlm decided to go
against that tradition, and so Muriel ’s Wedding is a charm-
ing yet bittersweet movie — perfect for a date.

Muriel Heslop is a chubby, unpopular girl from a
dysfunctional family. She is unable to hold a job, has never
had a boyfriend, her father constantly insults her, and she
has no prospects.

Then she meets an old friend who, though also not from
the “in” crowd, nevertheless loves life and enjoys herself
thoroughly. This new friendship slowly changes Muriel’s
life, giving her self-esteem and weaning her from the need
for acceptance through marriage, a goal which had always
dominated her dreams.

The ﬁrst thing you are likely to notice about this ﬁlm is
that, as I was told, it looks like a Mentos commercial.
People seem a little too perky, the clothes are pre-grunge,
and the English is accented. However, it gradually becomes
apparent that Muriel ’s life really does suck — one look at her
disgusting siblings convinces one ofthat.

So the obscure cast, known mostly through other Aus-
tralian features like Strictly Ballroom, is given a tough job
of balancing our disgust, pity and sympathy for the various
characters. Toni Collette, who plays Muriel, does this
admirably, mostly through the light giggles and bubbly
laughter which will suddenly possess her chubby body.

The emotional catalyst throughout the ﬁlm is Rhonda

(Rachel Grifﬁths), the old acquaintance whose joie de vivre
inspires Muriel. The power Grifﬁths gives her character,
especially after she becomes afflicted with cancer, is mov-
ing, yet never over-played.

The supporting cast does a similarly good job, especially
Muriel’s father (Bill Hunter). As the adulterous small—town
councilman whose local boosterism covers his political
failure, he gives a profound performance. Especially mov-
ing is the scene where he reveals, subtly and barely, that he
has always suffered from the same self-esteem problems
that now afflict Muriel.

P.J. Hogan is responsible for both the writing and direct-
ing, and he does both beautifully. The direction is admirably
light-handed, and the screenplay is a testimony to letting the
actors do their thing, without interference from troublesome
plot twists or unnecessary and overly dramatic soliloquies.

What I found most amazing about the ﬁlm was how
easily it swung me from one emotion to the next. The actors
and the script together are marvelous at keeping all the
battling thoughts in line: one moment we reviled by Muriel
or her family, the next we are laughing with her or crying for
her. These mood swings never seem artiﬁcial or too quick —
just part of the intense, roller-coaster ride of Muriel’s
personal life.

To top off everything else good about this ﬁlm, the movie

is full of references to and songs by Abba, the seventies

Swedish supergroup (to paraphrase something Muriel says
to convince us of her new-found success: “I used to listen to
Abba all day. Now I don’t have to listen to Abba at all. Now
my life is as good as an Abbasongl”). Be forewarned — if you
see this movie, you will want to own an Abba record; I hope
Wayne is stocking up.

Muriel’s Wedding is a bittersweet ﬁlm which provides
both laughs and tears. The acting is superior, yet homely, the
script is bare and elegant, and the soundtrack is totally
groovy. This is a sort of small ﬁlm which might not appear
in dollar theaters, so go see it now while it’s still on the
big screen.

hol Safety Action Program. The instuctor was one of
Lexington's finest. Originally, I viewed this course as a
mounmeiital inconvenice for the class was held on Thursday
nights, otherwise known as Phi hell night.

Following the first class, however, I realized the class
might not be that awful. After all, it was entertaining,
engaging, and informative. We discussed our arrests which
was amusing for many. We watched movies on drinking
and driving (you know, the ones they showed you before
prom to scare you into sober driving). We even practiced the
tests administered to those who are pulled over for D.U.I.
Needless to say, we all passed with ﬂying colors.

Despite all the informative discussion on alcohol and its
effects, the subject which had the most impact on me was the
tips for surviving Alumni Weekend. Our instructor in blue
was seriously interested in forewarning us about the police
presence in Lexington this weekend lest we repeat our
mistakes. Since my journalsitic instincts die hard, I rushed
back to the office to provide you with the same helpful hints
that were bestowed on me. Read closely:

1. Do not drink and drive. While this seems so
simple it’s stupid, you’ll be shocked how many people will
be arrested for D.U.I. If you are under 21, beware. The legal
limit is so low that you could be arrested for swallowing
cough syrup.

2. Don’t walk alone if you are drunk. Trust me
on this one, I have some experience with it. Our instructor
said the L.P.D. will not tolerate it. If you are arrested, plan
to spend the night in jail which ranks on the Top 10 Things
I Least Wishe To Do Again.

3. Don’t carry beer cans around town. Besides
being a generally bad idea, it is illegal for minors. Legal
drinkers should note that it is unlawful to consume alcohol
in public. Make sure the beer cans are sealed. Also, pour
drinks in cups to avoid carrying around cans. This greatly
reduces your chances of arrest.

4. Drink responsibly. The key to life (and Alumni
Weekend) is moderation. This is especially true of alcohol
consumption. Please watch our distinguished alumni for
they have returned to Lexington to re-live their glory days.
As my instructor pointed out, “You’ll see 60-year-olds
acting like they are 18 again.”

I hope these tips will be useful to all those who intend to
celebrate W&L’s alumni this weekend. 9'

Have fun, but be careful. While the Alcohol Safety
Action Program was painless, I wouldn’t like to see you
enroll for overzealous partying.

Political principle: DOA in the Senate?

JOSHUA
HESLINGA,
’98

 

Last week, the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee held
nomination hearings for Tennessee
abortionist Henry Foster, Bill Clinton’s
nominee to be the next surgeon general
ofthe United States. Since his nomina-
tion, controversy has raged over
Foster’s history of performing abor-
tions and forced sterilizations of re-
tarded women in the 1960s.

Revealingly, most debate and pro-
fessed opposition has centered on the
question of Foster’s credibility, due to
the differing numbers of abortions that
he and the White House have said he
performed. The widely differing ac-
counts have led several senators to
vocally oppose the nomination of
Dr. Foster.

Texas senator and presidential can-
didate Phil Gramm has vowed to fili-
buster Foster’s nomination if it ever
reaches the ﬂoor, saying, “This is a
person who has trouble leveling, and
there is one litmus test, and that is
being honest.”

Gramm’s threat and a similar con-
cern over conservative primary voters
has led fellow 1996 Republican candi-
date Bob Dole to tentatively declare
his opposition to Foster’s nomination

and to consider whether to use his
privilege as Senate Majority Leader
to prevent Foster’s nomination from
ever reaching the Senate ﬂoor. (Lest
you protest that he deserves a vote,
160 Reagan and Bush nominees died
without one.)

Foster’s supporters have responded
by denouncing attempts to oppose Fos-
ter as a political

Many pro-choicers claim that gov-

abortion decision. If that is true, why

position of national moral health spokes-
man? Why did Clinton’s failed health
care plan require all employers, regard-

a late 1994 survey
revealed that 59
percent of the mem-
bers of the Ameri-
can College of Ob-
stetricians and Gy-
necologists felt that
abortion should not
be required?

Why does the
U.S. government give $158 million
annually to Planned Parenthood, the
nation’s largest abortion provider,
whose founder Margaret Sanger once
wrote, “The most merciful thing a large
family does to one of its infant mem-
bers is to kill it”?

Why does the U.S. government give
$50 million annually to the UN Popula-

tion Fund, which is instrumental in sup-
porting China’s one-child forced-abor-
tion policies, when two respected En-
glish-language Hong Kong publications
have now reported that Chinese medi-
cal centers routinely sell aborted fetuses
for human consumption, believing that
eating them is therapeutic?

The reporters on the story were
even given a tube often aborted babies
free of charge because they looked ill,
along with recipes on how to prepare a
good soup with the remains. (Virginia
Representative Frank Wolf (R) is now
calling for a complete investigation of
these atrocities.)

More than 32 million babies have
been aborted since 1973 in America
alone, the largest human genocide in
history. Those that believe the Foster
nomination is all about credibility would
do well to reﬂect on where humanity is
headed, especially in view of the reports
from China.

At the Nuremberg war crimes trials
after World War II, medical consultant
Dr. Leo Alexander offered the follow-
ing analysis of the origins of the Nazi
medical atrocities: “The beginnings at
first were merely a subtle shift in em-
phasis in the basic attitude of the physi-
cians. It started with the acceptance of
the attitude, basic in the euthanasia
movement, that there is such a thing as
a life not worthy to be lived.”

That acceptance must never take
hold in the United States. It is time to
stand up to abortion on principle, not
political expediency. Dr. Foster must
not be confirmed. 1

This was hard work.

After all, I had to make sure everyone on the
Hill was happy so that the cardboard tube would
actually contain a sheepskin on June 2, and at the
same time, ensure that there was ample time to
tube the river Maury and enjoy the fruits of
Alumni Weekend.

As a freshman in a fraternity back in May of
1991, I remember being told what to expect from
this particular series of events. My fraternity big
brother summed it up as a weekend to both fear
and over which to rejoice.

“There are going to be alums coming back that
are going to feed you more liquor than you’ve ever
consumed on any one night in your life,” he
explained. “You’re going to have an absolute
ball-if you don’t die.”

This sounded kinda cool, but I remember tell-
ing everyone that I wanted to actually go to one or
two weekend lectures on the Hill. They groaned.

No one actually goes to any of that crap,” they
told me. “The alums are going to come into town
and go directly to The Palms, and they’re going to
drink until they can’t see anymore.”

It was soon after that I learned to put myself
into the shoes of the younger alumni, who were
returning to Lexington after being in the “real
world” for perhaps only two or three years.

Would these young folks remember Washing-
ton and Lee University as the place where the
greatest of academic minds came together to pro-
vide the greatest intellectual environment one
can ﬁnd?

OPINION

Cable Two line-up needs more...pizzazz

GREEN LAND
Betsy Green

We all know that there are a lot of
ways to waste time, but few are as
foolproof as watching TV. I always
find myself thinking things like, “Be-
fore I start to work on the midterm
that’s worth 50 percent of my grade, I
want to check real quick what’s on
MTV.” Six hours later, I’m thinking,
“Okay if the next video isn’t any good,
then I swear l’ll do my work.”

In recent years, W&L Cable Two
has been working hard for all of us,
providing more and more program-
ming to keep us from furthering our
education. If it weren’t for Chris Albert
and The Dating Game, we’d probably
all be okay with the higher standards
for Dean’s List. Still, with so many
hours without broadcasting, there is
still a chance we could start to use our
time productively. With that in mind,
I’d like to make some suggestions for
new programming on Cable Two.

Everyone loves game shows like
The Dating Game, so why not have
more of them? Let’s face it—as fun as
The Dating Game might be, it doesn’t
paint a realistic picture of life at W&L
as we know it. The solution is obvious:
The Hook-up Game. Contestants
will meet in a dark room with loud
music and a few cases of cheap beer.
Under the watchful cameras of Cable
Two, we will let nature do her thing.
The Hook-up Game will be similar to
its predecessor in that the contestants
will ask each other questions, but on
this show, the music will be too
loud for anyone to hear the

answers. Example:

Bachelor Number One: So, where
are you from’?

Bachelorette NumberThree: WHAT?

Bachelor Number One: I SAID,
“WHERE ARE YOU FROM?”

Bachelorette NumberTwo: TAURUS.

Bachelor Number One: OH, RE-
ALLY? MY RO0MMATE’S
FROM HOUSTON.

Tyson Hilton suggested that at the

pecially those who
have nothing in
common. Put them
in an apartment full
of tapestries, Elvis
lamps, and other
funky decorating
items. Watch them
fight and discuss
their angst.

W&L angst is
not exactly on a par with the angst of
the rest of the world, but that could be
part of the fun. Nonnal people angst: I
can’t find a job, my relationship is way
too complicated, and I’m afraid that
my newest body piercing will get in-
fected. W&L angst: I hope I can find a
date to FD.

Cable Two’s hard-working staff
should strive to ﬁnd the newest trends
in television and rip them off. That

ideal is the heart and soul of the show
L-E-X-I-N-G-T-0-N Blue.

Look out Jimmy Smits! You have
some new competition with R.D.
Clark. This police drama’s trendy new
jerky camera shots will focus on the
cops during their tensest moments——
chalking car tires and ticketing way-
ward dogs. Episodes may feature par-
tial nudity. Parental discretion
is advised.

There’s no reason Cable Two
shouldn’t be educational. The station
could provide a great service to the
W&Lcommunity with a cooking show
such as Sarah Gilbert’s Cooking
with Alcohol.

Sarah will charm us all with her
booze-soaked food, including her fa-
mous Lemon Rum Cake. The show
will be even better as Sarah begins to
sample her concoctions. She’ll eventu-
ally turn a cute shade of pink
and tell everyone personal things
about herself.

We can’t leave out the importance
of sports coverage in the Cable Two
broadcast day. A show like Battle of
the “Freshman Friends ”will show-
case the fading talents of the many
recovering high school athletes at
Washington and Lee.

For example, upperclassmen could
suggest to their freshman friends that
they fetch them drinks. The smarter
freshman would swipe the drink from
the other freshman. Other events in
The Battle of the “Freshman Friends”
could include the Stop-In Run, the

Clean-Up-A-Thon, and the Car
Wash Rally.

All events would, of course,
be optional. ~

The possibilities are endless.

Susong review of Rob Roy off-target

To the editor:

After reading Kirk Susong’s review
of Rob Roy in the May 5 edition of The
Ring-tum Phi, we can only conclude
that Kirk Susong’s qualifications as a
film critic are questionable. His analy-
sis of Rob Roy unfairly attacked the
finer points of this film and apparently
missed its point.

First, Liam Neeson’s and Jessica
Lange’s performances left nothing to
be desired. Liam Neeson’s portrayal of

the main character was highly appro-
priate; Rob Roy was an ordinary man
who rose to become a hero in extraor-
dinary circumstances. The “humanity
about him”- is exactly what makes
Neeson’s character believable as a folk
legend. A folk legend is not a super-
hero; he represents the common man.

Furthermore, to label Jessica Lange
as a “disappointment” is preposterous.
Her strength and so-called “stubbom-
ness” depict the dignity of a great
woman. Her rendition of this character

is inspiring, especially in a time when
few such roles are available for women.

Regarding Susong’s criticism of the
use of historical accuracy, one can only
shudder to think of the sort of “glossy”
film he would have produced, had he
been behind the camera.

The historical accuracy serves to
provide realism and to reinforce par-
ticular aspects of some of the charac-
ters. For example, the chamber-pot
scene successfully shows Cunningham
to be truly vile. In addition, we canot

imagine Robert Roy as a crisply
pressed, perfectly coiffed, mani-
cured Fabio.

Mr. Susong’s reviews are generally
negative in tone (and tend to reveal the
entire plot, spoiling the movie forthose
who have not yet seen it); sometimes
the ﬁlms are deserving of such criti-
cism. However, in this case, he is to-
tally off-base.

25 years ago in The Phi: ‘Two Views of Seven Days’ aftermath’

Editor's Note: 25 years ago, Washington and Lee ’s students staged a mass protest on the front lawn with the aim of having Spring Term classes cancelled so that students could attend Vietnam War protests at the University of Virginia and at other ‘
locations. The EC passed an anti-war resolution, and the students voted in a resolution that classes should be cancelled and graded on a pass-fail basis based upon work completed. Finally, a faculty compromise allowed students who wished to
leave do so and to make up their classwork the following year. The following articles are reprinted from the May 13, I970 editorial page of The Ring-tum Phi.

By Dave Olson sources, and these sources would be
displeased (to say the least) if this
school had shut down, or if 80 percent
of the student body left which they
probably would have done if a pass-
fail option had been instituted. Can
we blame the faculty? I think not. For
many of the faculty, W&L is their
whole life, their raison d’etre.

They would not want to take a step
that would endanger the life of this
university and subsequently theirjobs.
It is a very real and a very human
consideration, but I wonder if, at this
juncture in the school year, if pass-
fail (which really was the desire of the
students) would have made that great
a difference.

I don’t think it would have, and
many schools (Brown and Yale in-
cluded) have pass-fail for everything.
Would it have made that much differ-
ence if W&L had done it for
one semester?

The faculty seems to feel so
because it would look bad to
graduate schools.

The faculty still clings to the idea
that they have to protect us from the
onerous possibility. It is a manifesta-
tion of the idea of in loco parentis, and
even more so, the generation gap.

The difference is that the faculty
feels that they have to retain a certain
semblance ofhierarchy and adminis-
trative security while the students
feel that W&L has to make a forth-
right statement to the nation about
our condemnation of the war. To the
faculty the former is most important,
while to the students the latter is
imperative.

I think the difference may well
stem from an expanded moral con-
science on the part of our generation.
This is not to criticize the faculty, but
they are products of their times, as we
are. The problem is that these are
our times, times of expanded
moral consciences.

Sooner or later Richard Nixon will
realize this. or at least I hope they
will. The interval between now and
the time the older generation realizes

our values and aims could be very By Reeve Kelsey
troublesome. I hope we, this Univer-
sity, this nation and this planet
can survive.

happened and what does it mean? One
has observed a generally activist stu-
dent body and a ﬂexible response on
the part of the faculty.

The initial faculty action showed
an understanding on the part of the
faculty of the need to combine the
desires of the concerned students
with the academic integrity of
the University.

The faculty action with its Monday
night amendments allows those stu-
dents who feel intellectual pursuits are
no longer gennane to the problems
they face to leave the University com-
munity and make up their work at a
later time. The faculty action also reaf-
ﬁrmed the basic purpose of the Uni-
versity—to teach and to be a home for
intellectual activities in all disciplines.

The student resolution, itself, was a
poorly worded document offering
something for everyone.

We feel that a resolution of this
nature must stand independent of out-
side interpretations. The student pro-
ponents cannot invoke the plea of
Humpty Dumpty when he said, “When
I use a word it means just what I choose
it to mean——-neither more nor less.”

There was not something in the
resolution that appealed to all students,
even the 254 who explicitly rejected
the proposal. The resolution did con-
tain two regrettable phrases, “closing
Washington and Lee” and “Declare all
classes canceled.” If the proponents of
the resolution did not really wantclasses
canceled, why were these two phrases
left in the proposal?

The second major objection to the
plan was that there was no guarantee
that classes would continue as sched-
uled. A professor would not have been
obligated to continue classes.

There are many other problems in-
volved in ending the semester on May
6. Is it really ethically justiﬁable to
give a student a “B” for four-ﬁfths of
the work of last year’s “B” student?
How does a professor really give a
grade if the only work to be turned in
for the course was the ﬁnal exam?

What does this mean for the future?

W&L’s student body is now activist--
the days of apathy are at last truly dead
and buried. It is the job of student
leadership to channel this activism into
positive results. Results that comple-
ment the goals of the University.

The long run implications of the
student action are of such signiﬁcance
that they cannot be overlooked. Is the
abandoning of a structured curriculum
a decision that should be made
under the immediate stress of an
outside issue?

There is much to be said for an
unstructured curriculum with the stu-
dent doing what he desires. Next year’s
short tenn is an effort to positively face
this issue.

Furthermore the faculty’s present
resolution has serious ramiﬁcations.
Can any student at any time for any
reason withdraw and receive an “I”

The crisis continues, but today one
hopes that the worst is over. What

“This has been a tremendous afﬁr-
mation of the potential of the W&L
student body. There is hope.” Fran
Lawrence stated the case beautifully.

We have seen in the past few days
an extraordinary series of acts on the
part of the student body. What they
have done is, to this writer, amazing.
We have come out of our noted apa-
thy and worked. We have worked
hard to do something together, and
we did.

It took Kent State to do it, but we
did take action. If we, as a student
body, can keep this kind of action
going, we can advance by leaps and
bounds next year. The only problem
is that these advances are contingent
on the acceptance of them by the
faculty and the administration.

What the faculty failed to realize
in their perfunctory, though sincere
consideration of the student proposal
is that they no longer are required to
look after our well-being. We are
here to learn, not to be administered
to. “I think if we had pass-fail, then
everyone would go to Virginia Beach”
was a statement heard from more
than one member of the faculty.

It astounds me that these faculty
members could so miss the point of
the student resolution. It was not an
attempt at getting out the easy way. It
was an attempt to achieve the free-
dom that is necessary to do what we
have to do.

The reason the student resolution
got turned down is unclear, but these
are some likely choices. One, the
faculty could have a great great lack
of perception, but that is unlikely.

They could feel that if they had
done something like institute pass-
fail, no one would show up for their
classes. I do not think the faculty is
that sensitive. I think they turned it
down because of outside pressure and
certain things they realized about the
position of W&L.

Certainly much of our money
comes from rather conservative

_ ...-.~.»...,,;;,,,_,_' 

 

     

resolution are even more severe.

Does a student have the right to
leave classes at any time for a reason-
able cause and receive a “P” for the
work that he misses? Again these are
all legitimate questions, but ones that
should not be resolved in the fast mo-
ment of the events of last week.

Yesterday’s assembly seemed to
focus directly on who should wield the
power in a university. We have long
argued that the faculty should not act
in loco parentis and we will
continue to.

However, we feel that the faculty or
the administration should have ulti-
mate jurisdiction over matters pertain-
ing to the curriculum. The students
should not have the ﬁnal, ultimate ju-
risdiction over what courses are to be
offered, how the curriculum should be
structured or what professors should
be hired.

There should be student representa-
tion in these decisions, and there has
been increasing student participation
in these areas.

There now exists a tremendous force
for action in the student body. Let us
hope that it is used to the beneﬁt of the
entire University community.

Lax uses late charge to storm past Keydets in Classic

By SCOTT BOOKWALTER
Phi Sports Editor

Chalk up another one for
Washington and Lee.

Last Saturday, in front of a
boisterous crowd of 3,100 at Vir-
ginia Military lnstituu/s Alumni
Memorial Field, W&L streaked
past VMI by a count of] 1-8 in the
eighth annual Lee-Jackson La-
crosse Classic. In the process, the
Generals retained their Lexing-
ton city championship.

W&L used a seven-goal run
midway through the second half
to cruise to the win.

The victory was the Generals’
seventh consecutive in the Clas-
sic against their neighboring Lex-
ington rivals, the Keydets.

VMl’s only win in the series
came in the ﬁrst game, a 15-9
triumph back in 1989.

W&L holds an 8-1 advantage
in the all-time series against the
Keydets, which began in 1986.

Senior Scott Mackley (10) returned from a two-game absence due to injury to spark the Generals on a
seven-goal spree in the second half, and an 11-8 triumph over the VMI Keydets. W&L finishes at 9-5.

Tennis falls to Kenyon in semifinals

Besides the rivalry, the Gen-
erals’ victory proved to be an
important way to end the season.
W&L entered the game mired in
a slump, having dropped its pre-
vious three contests to fall to 8-5.

“We’ve been pretty inconsis-
tent the last few weeks, and have
been up and down with inju-
ries,” head coach Jim Stagnitta
said. “Saturday, we proved to
ourselves that we’re a lot better
than we’ve shown.”

VMI caused plenty of con-
cern for W&L this year, since it
came in with a 9-4 record.

The Keydets did nothing to
dispel that fear when Joe
Brockman scored the game’s first
goal with 13:04 remaining in the
first quarter.

W&L kept VMl’s high-oc-
tane offense undercontrol forthe
remainder of the half.

Junior midfielder Adam
Butterworth, who ﬁnished with
three goals and one assist, put the

Generals on the scoreboard for
the first time four minutes later.

“l’ve really been impressed
with Adam the last six weeks,”
Stagnitta commented. “He is a
person who has stepped up his
game and taken charge.”

Goals by seniormidﬁelderTy
Tydings and junior attackman
Russell Croft elevated the Gen-
erals to a 3-1 advantage with
10:20 left in the first half.

It was a sign of bigger and
better things to come from Croft,
who would tack on three more
goals to his total before the after-
noon was over.

Thanks in large part to a goal
and assist from Rob Worrell, VMI
finished the half with a ﬂurry,
knotting the game at 4-4 by the
end of the half.

The Keydets began the sec-
ond half as hot as they ended the
first half.

Consolation matches are not easy to get excited about, especially
after being one singles match away from playing for the national

championship.

The W&L women’s tennis team, though, must gear themselves up
for Friday’s third-place match at the NCAA Division lll nationals at

Sweet Briar College.

The Generals (20-2) were beaten, 5-4, by number—one seed Kenyon
College in Thursday’s semifinal match. It was the second time this
year the third-seeded Generals lost to Kenyon by that same score.

lf Kenyon goes on to win Friday‘s championship match, W&L
would at least know that the national champs were only one ﬂight
better than the Generals, since Kenyon also won a previous 5-4 match

in Lexington.

Kenyon will face the winner ofthe UC-San Diego vs. Trinity (TX)
semiﬁnal at 10:00 AM for the national title, while W&L takes on the
losing team for third-place at the same time.

Results ofthe W&L match can be found by calling the W&LSports

Hotline at 463-8998.

The Generals got off to an impressive start Thursday, winning two

of the three doubles matches.

The nationally third-ranked tandem of senior Marilyn Baker and
freshman Natalia Garcia won an 8-6 battle, and the team of j uniorJ ulie
Ayers and freshman Berry Blankenship won at third-doubles, 8-4.

This was a turnaround from the March 17 competition, when

Kenyon won twice at

29th of the year, breaking Baker’s school record,_which was set last
year. Baker has currently won 28 this season and IS three wins shy of

100 for her career.

However, Baker (#1), and Ayers (#3), were beaten a day after
posting a pair of sensational wins in the quarterﬁnal on Wednesday.
Baker, the nation’s sixth-ranked player, knocked off top-ranked
Julie Rosenstein in straight sets, 7-5, 6-2, to lead W&L to a 6-3 win

over Amherst College.

Amherst won twice at doubles to put a scare into the Generals. But
W&L “worked it” at singles, according to one onlooker, taking ﬁve
of six to advance to the semiﬁnals.

Garcia and Shapard won brief and impressive 6-0, 6-0 matches,
and junior Shelley Sundennan won at number-six, 6-2, 6-1. Shapard ’s
win took barely 45 minutes to complete.

The match of the day, though, was at number-three. Ayers and
Amherst’s Ting Yu fought for over three hours before Ayers walked
away with a marathon 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 win.

That win guaranteed the team its best ﬁnish ever, topping lastyear’s
sixth-place performance at nationals.

On Tuesday, the Generals showed that they had shaken off the
pain of last year’s opening round loss to Williams College. W&L

routed Skidmore, 8-1.

The Generals won all three doubles ﬂights, and their only loss in
singles was a three-set defeat for Ayers (6-2, 2-6, 6-4).

At number—one, Baker beat a longtime rival of hers, third-ranked

The early-season success

minutes of the half, the Generals
went on a rampage.

Beginning with an Andy
Dutton coal and ending with an
Ande Jenkins score, W&L ﬁred
off seven consecutive goals to
take command at 11-7. Croft
provided three of his scores dur-
ing this span.

Senior attackman Dutton ﬁn-
ished his ﬁnal game in a Gener-
als' uniform with two goals and
one assist.

‘‘It took the wind out of their
sails after we tied it up,” Stagnitta
explained.

The stunned Keydets could
only manage a meaningless goal
with less than four minutes to
play to provide the ﬁnal margin
for the game.

W&L scored 51 times in the
fourth quarter during the season,
its most of any period.

The game was reminiscent of
the 1994 Lee-Jackson Classic.
In that contest the Generals also
broke away from VMI late, scor-
ing four consecutive times to
break a 7-7 deadlock, and propel
W&L to a 12-10 victory.

Despite winning nearly every
statistical battle, VMI had a dif-
ficult time penetrating W&L
goalie Scott Jackson.

Jackson received the starting
nod for only the second time this
season, but he appeared more
than capable in front of the net.

The freshman faced nineteen
shots, and recorded eleven saves
on the afternoon.

Stagnitta was extremely
pleased with the Generals’ per-

described. “We ﬁnally realized

Junior Ande Jenkins finished
the year as the Generals’ top scorer
with 31 goals and eight assists
for a total of 39 points.
Croft came in second on the
team with 38 points. V‘
Senior Scott Mackley netted
25 goals, and Butterworth scored
24 times.
Tydings ended as the team
leader in assists with 22.
Sophomore Doug Gubner
stopped 123 shots on the season
for a .577 save percentage. .
W&L completed the 1995
campaign with a 9-5 mark, (5-Iii
in the ODAC), an identical over- ‘i
all log as the 1994 squad. The
men closed with a number-ten
ranking in Division III. 
Last season, the Generals ﬁn-

ished with a #11 mark. yt

The Generals have now rung
up a streak of a different kind: six
straight seasons of at least nine
victories each year.

W&L has not been missing

were by no means bored last weekend.

Director of Security Mike Young
said, “Activity-wise, this was the busi-

All together there were 15 _arrests of
Washington and Lee students and
alumni. The arrests included four ar-
rests for noise violations, one arrest for
purchase of alcohol for a person under
21, four arrests for possession of alco-
hol by a person under 21, one arrest for

speeding, two for drunk in public, one
for reckless driving, one for driving
under the influtence, and one
for littering.

Chief of Police Bruce Beard said
that this past weekend was “busier
than usual”.

Adding to the commotion of the

Sororities vote
on housing

By BETHANY BAUMAN
Phi Staff Writer

At Monday’s Panhellenic Council
meeting, about 140 of Washington and
Lee’s Greek women voted on what
type of facility they would like to have
for their sororities. The women were
presented with four options. The ﬁrst
was a sorority house, comparable to
what the fraternities have now, The
second option was a sorority lodge,
which would not house any of the
women, but would provide dining ser-
vices and meeting/msh rooms. The
third option was also a lodge, but one in
which officers of the sorority would be
able to live. The ﬁnal choice was a
sorority complex with a central kitchen,
meeting rooms, rush rooms, and a cen-
tral ballroom for date functions. No
one would live in the complex.

Panhellenic president Suzanne
Sharp said that Monday’s vote was
split 50-50 between the ﬁrst two op-
tions. Sharp hopes to have the approxi-
mately 250 sorority members that were

not present at the Panhellenic Council
meeting vote at their chapter meetings
on Monday. According to Sharp, this
round of voting was to, “...just gain a
consensus among the Greek women
here about what kind of sorority facil-
ity they want because we definitely
feel that one is needed.”

The Panhellenic Council and the
housing chairs of the four sororities
will research the different options and
will contact other universities with sys-
tems similar to Washington and Lee’s
to see what has been most successful.
Sharp hopes that the sorority members
will have a ﬁnal decisions on what type
of houses or lodges they would like by
next year.

When these facilities will actually
become a reality depends on the
university’s funding and long range
plans. Sharp, however, remains hope-
ful, stating that, “We’re basically just
beginning the journey toward having

When approached by Reverend Burr Datz, Catholic Campus Minister

The idea of a ﬁnal lecture further intimidated Wilson, as the label “last”,
so often applied in his last few months as W&L president, carries with it a
“terrible, lugubrious” connotation” of ﬁnality.

Having ultimately shrugged off his reservations in delivering the
lecture, Wilson encountered further difﬁculties in his selection of a topic
upon which to reﬂect.

Wilson ﬁrst considered speaking upon his upcoming retirement from
the presidency, leaving behind so many memories and friends. Another
possibility presented itself in the form of a timely lecture on the relation-
ships between men and women in Macbeth.

Gender differences ﬁnally arose in Wilson’s mind, a subject of much
interest to Washington and Lee even today, nine years after co-education.

Society for the Arts to end year with gala

The Society for the Arts will end the

year with a sophisticated and posh per-
fonnance of musical, visual, and liter-
ary art that will feature some of Wash-

ington and Lee’s most accomplished
artists.

“An Evening with the Arts” is
chaired by Senior Noelle Parrot. The
event will highlight students who have
distinguished themselves in the arts.

The impetus came from Jonathan

outside the co-op.

The Society for the Arts advertises for their ‘Evening with the Arts’

VanDyke, said Parrot.

“We wanted to celebrate the arts
with a kind of formal affair that is so
popular at Washington and Lee,” said
Parrot.

The event will begin at the Alumni
House around 6:30 p.m. featuring live
jazz music and a display of student art
work. Heavy hors d’oeuvre will be
served and a cash bar will be available
for those patrons over 21. The festivi-
ties will oontinue at 8 p.m in Lee
Chapel with a poetry reading and mu-
sical performances.

Parrot hopes 150 students will at-
tend, ﬁlling the capacity of the Alumni
House.

Tickets are on sale outside of the co-
op for ﬁve dollars per person.

The Society of the Arts exploded
onto the W&L social scene earlier this
year offering an alternative to the stan-
dard fare of fraternity parties and
Zollman bashes.

Strangely enough, the original pur-
pose of the group was quite different.

The Society was founded to focus
attention on the arts because they have
been largely neglected in recent years.

Sarah Anne Ryder will be the
Society’s chairman next year. She
hopes to expand the group’s activities
and funding.

“We have different people in lead-
ership positions and they should bring
new ideas,” said Ryder.

She hopes to help sponsor the
Writer’s Harvest, the poetry reading
from which proceeds go to Lexington’s
food bank.

Ryder said the Society has received
overwhelming support. Most of the
feedback has been positive.

Ryder reaffirmed the group’s main
goal, “We will continue to bring talent
into the forefront.”

 

Alluding to the recent sexist remarks of a professional golfer, Wilson
commented that “we have a little of [such sentiment] here.”

The debate also spurred many less amusing and “vastly less creative”
bumperstickers—- in Wilson’s words “a throwback to I don’t know what.”

Yet men’s colleges were fast becoming extinct in America, and Wilson
recalls the concern of W&L faculty that “we would become
philosophically obsolete.” 1

Wilson concluded his lecture with a discussion of the relationship
between Alma Schindler, “a serious intelligent young woman,” and her
husband. The life of Alma serves as a “remarkable story that has been lived
by many others,” Wilson fears.

Maler, then twice her age and at the pinnacle of his musical career.
husband. The life of Alma serves as a “remarkable story that has been lived
by many others,” Wilson fears.

In 1902, at the age of 22, Alma married the famous composer Gustav
Maler, then twice her age and at the pinnacle of his musical career.

Even before the marriage, Maler clariﬁed to Alma in a letter that, in
order to be his wife, she must “become what I need to behappy: my wife,
not my colleague.” .

Alma, musically inclined in her own way, thus entered the marriage
accepting that she must suppress her own artistic interests in order to further
those of her eminent husband.

The price at which Alma agreed to such conditions was high, indeed:
“the loss of a very important part of her existence.”

In her memoirs years later, Alma wrote, “His genius ate me up, although
he meant no murder.”

Wilson finds in the experience of Alma “a small footnote” marking the
tragedy of subjugating one’s ability to that of others, however talented.

“We’ve come to recognize there is a great harm in frustrating the ability
of anyone,” Wilson concluded; accidents of race, creed or sex must have no
bearing on opportunity, both in the world of higher learning and beyond.‘

On Tuesday, the Paul Ehrlich Foundation announced that Jack
Strominger of Harvard University, Pamela Bjorkman of the California
Institute of Technology, and Hans-George Rammensee of the German
Cancer Research Center will share this year’s Paul Ehrlich Prize. The top
German medical prize is being awarded to the three scientists for their

research has led to essential progress in developing several vaccines, and
possibly in the treatment of cancer and AIDS.

Three journalists jailed

A state security court in Istanbul, Turkey sentenced two journalists and
their publisher to prison on Tuesday. The three were found to be in
violation of the country’s anti-terrorism laws after quoting allegedly
separatist comments made by a Kurdish legislatorwho was jailed last year.
The two journalists, Hidir Goktas and Metin Gulbay, were sentenced to
twenty months in prison, while their publisher, Hasan Basri Ciplak, was
sentenced to ﬁve.

Graham-Lee-Washington Society I
debates student autonomy issue

By Michael Hewlett
Phi Associate Editor

Approximately 60 Washington and
Lee students debated, sometimes heat-
edly, whether students are losing their
autonomy in the Graham-Lees-Wash-
ington annual Spring Dinner Debate on
Wednesday night.

The debaters were seniors Jonathan
Van Dyke, Kelly Brotzman, and Alex
Cross and junior Kirk Susong.

Brotzman said that the word “au-
tonomy” has been thrown around in
recent months. Issues such as Winter
Rush and sophomore housing require-
ment have pushed student autonomy to
the forefront. She argued that one part
of the institution cannot be totally au-
tonomous. Each constituency has cer-
tain rights but also certain obligations
which is to act in the best interests of the
school as a whole.

Susong believed the faculty exists in
the interests of the students. He cited
Robert Lee ending the war between the
faculty and students after the Civil War
as the beginning of student self—gover—

The dog’s the Winner in the The

nance. He thinks some of this self-
govemance is being taken away.

Cross said Washington and Lee is
original and the faculty has a preoccu-
pation with being on the top 25 of U.S.
World and Report .

“This school is not for everybody,”
Cross said. “Please don’t make this
university a Swarthmore, a Amherst.”
He argued the administration is trying
to take away what makes W&Lunique.

Van Dyke disagreed. “To say we’re
losing our rights ignores the fact that
we come into a community,”
he explained.

“Our social life and academic life
are intertwined and we need to recog-
nize that.”

Brotzman argued that trying to at-
tach a monolithic model to the univer-
sity is misguided. She said diversity
should be encouraged and should not
be in conﬂict with what makes the
university unique.

Van Dyke said homogeneity con-
flicts with the goals of a liberal
arts education.

“The goal of a liberal arts education
is to open yourself to different people.”

Once the main debaters had made

Phi News Editor

Home to such campus events as the Evans Dining
Hall Pig Roast and the Mr. W&L Pageant, the
Baker Quad last Wednesday, May 17, set
the stage for the first annual Kappa Alpha Theta

Date Auction.

The auction, organized by the W&L sorority,
recruited 22 men and women of all four classes as
dates upon which an enthusiastic audience, after
paying $1.00 for admittance, could bid.

All funds raised will beneﬁt the sorority’s chari-
ties including Habitat for Humanity and Intema—

tional Philanthropy.

Freshman Jackie Terrebonne, who emceed the
auction along with senior Bob Philips, recalls that
“after a while people started having a good time,” and

bidding wars soon developed.

One of the lucky audience participants to walk
away from the auction with a date, freshman Juliana
Edmunds “thought the auction was a great idea.”

“An evening with my date,” Edmunds adds, “is
well worth the $11.00. Normally he charges more.”

Perhaps the most sou ght-after date, however, was
neither boy nor girl, but instead a party by the name

of Bear, a midnight blue Labrador.

The lucky girl to win a date with Bear, freshman
Caroline Yates, admits, “I love dogs, and know every

dog on campus by name.”

“I thought it’d be fun to spend a day with a dog,

Yates explains.

Yates was not the only member of the audience to
fall under the spell of Bear, however.
“Four other girls were ﬁghting with me,” she

general statements, the debate was
opened to audience participation.

Senior Kevin Batteh said he had no
problem with diversity but he thinks
that there are some things the faculty
should not fool with. ‘‘I don’t think you
should tinker with the fundamental
values [of the university].”

One of the fundamental values of
the university, the Honor System, came
into the debate.

“I am appalled by the lack of respect
for the Honor System in the freshmen
class, said senior Elise Brown.

Some students argued that diversity
is ﬁne, but if applicants are not going to
abide by the Honor System, they should
not come here.

Cross believed the need for diver-
sity is even more reason why students
should have more self-governance.

Van Dyke said students should have
more choice in the activities they par-
ticipate rather than going to fraterni-
ties. He thinks giving students more
choice was what the faculty had in
mind when they voted for Winter Rush.

Susong had a different view.

“The faculty members are trying to
socially engineer us.”

He said the faculty should have no
control over students’ social activities.
“What makes the faculty qualiﬁed

to talk about our social life?,” he said.-

“There are some professors who are
less socially mature than students at
my junior year.”

Junior Rick Hill said the faculty ,

doesn’t respect the students.

“The faculty doesn’t give a damn .

what we think.”

He said the faculty and administra-
tion is attacking students’ ability to
make their own decisions.

Brown said the faculty simply
doesn’t put their trust in the students to
make their decision. Calling on her
experience as President of the
PanhellenicCouncil,sheexplainedthat
in PHC, if there is ever an issue is
serious enough to go before the Judi-
cial Board, the ﬁnal decision is made
by the Student Affairs Committee.

“I should be able to look at an issue
at age 22 and say that hazing is wrong
and you should not do it,” she said.

Suson g agreed. “We should be given ‘at,

respect because we pay to go here.”
But Brotzman said, “We also have
to earn respect.”

Everybody wants some Southern Comfort

By Brsrsv GREEN
Phi Staff Writer

Fans of Washington and Lee’s
male a cappella group Southern
Comfort won’t have to wait for con-
certs to hear their melodies any
longer. The group released a CD
last week entitled Everybody Wants
Some. Southern Comfort member
Tommy Esposito said that the re-
lease of the CD was timely. “Every
four years or so, Southern Comfort
has recorded a tape,” he explained.
The members of the group were
intrigued by the possibility of re-
cording on CD. Said Esposito, “We
all went nuts at the idea of putting

out a CD. We were all curious about
how the group would sound.” Kip Ebel,
another Southern Comfort member,
said that he and the other seniors were
especially pleased to be recording. “It
gives us something to take from the
group besides memories,” he explained.

The album was recorded live at
Lenfest Center after Christmas break
with engineer Gary Humiston. South-
ern Comfort member Rob Eison felt
that the beginning of Winter Term was
the perfect time for the group to begin
the project. “We had just ﬁnished per-
forming at The Greenbrier for New
Year’s, and we were in good shape
musically.”

Recording live posed many chal-
lenges to the group. Eison said that just
getting all of the members of the group

together at the same time could be
difﬁcult. There were musical challenges
as well. “We were most concerned
about getting a good blend of sound. In
a CD more than in a live performance,
people will hear mistakes,” said
Esposito. Each of the thirteen songs on
the album had to be performed be-
tween ﬁve and ten times.

According to Ebel, “It was difﬁcult
to stay focused sometimes. Insistence
on perfection plagued us, but it paid
off.” Esposito agreed, “You got a head-
ache sometimes, you were thinking so
hard.” Everybody Wants Some fea-
tures many of Southern Comfort per-
formance favorites, such as
“Moondance,” “My Girl,” “Faith,” and
“In the Still of the Night.” Anyone who
has seen Southern Comfort perform is

familiar with the group’s sense of hu-
mor. “We wanted to bring our person-
ality into the album,” said Esposito.
Eison believes that compared to the
group’s usual performance style they
were, “pretty tame” but that their per-
sonality is still apparent. The liner notes
of the CD are full of inside jokes,
including thanks to, “the arousing but
excessively pierced young ladies in
San Francisco.”

The disc itself is decorated with,
“altemate titles to the album,” an idea
that Eison said was, “pretty much for
our own amusement.” Jokes aside,
Eison said, “I think the music stands by
itself.”Everybody Wants Some is avail-
able on CD or tape at the bookstore.
Southern Comfort’s ﬁnal perfonnance
of the year will be at baccalaureate.

The deed is done. Macbeth (J .D. Martinez) and Lady Macbeth (Adrienne Bryant

By COURTNEY E. MILLER
Phi Features Editor

Tonight’s production of Macbeth
won’t feature men in tights, and velvet,
nor will the audience hear the long
eloquent Shakespearean monologues.
This production of Macbeth, directed
by Andrew Fracher is set in the modern
world, a place just as dangerous and
threatening as that of ancient Scotland.

Guest Director, Fracher, is a native
of Waynesboro, Va. He jumped at the
chance to direct his dear friend and
colleague, Joseph Martinez in the pro-
duction of Macbeth.

‘‘I’m a ﬁrm proponent of taking
Shakespeare out of the museum and
concentrating on what is universal in
his plays,” said Fracher.

Macbeth, the shortest of
Shakespeare’s tragedies tells the tale
of a good man, gone bad. In Macbeth’s
quest for absolute power, he and his
wife are corrupted and eventually de-
stroyed by greed.

Fracher sees great application of
Shakespeare’s contemporary themes.
There are many questions that Macbeth
brings to the consciousness of his audi-
ence, “What makes a good person go
wrong? Is it fate or dark forces from
the outside or are those things simply
part of human nature? What might

aftermath of such an act? Does truth
will out and do those what deserve it
get their just desserts?”

Fracher’s adaptation takes the play
from ancient Scotland to a contempo-
rary militaristic society. The set re-
ﬂects this militaristic style with its metal
framework and austerity.

“I strongly believe that although the
time and place might be very different,
the themes that he writes about and
investigates in his plays are as perti-
nent now as they have ever been,” said
Fracher.

J.D. Martinez will be playing the
part of Macbeth. He is an Associate
Professor of Theater at W&L, and a
graduate of the Royal Academy of
Dramatic A11, in London England.

In addition, he is also a member of
Actor’s Equity Association, and past
president of The Society of American
Fight Directors. As a specialist in
Stage Fight Choreography, he has
authored several texts.

“Seeking a way to portray a
Shakespearean tragic hero is a difﬁcult
and lonely journey. My journey began
with the search for an acting style that
would serve the breakneck pace of the
dynamic tragedy,” said Martinez.

Martinez calls his chosen acting
style “sensational realism.” This style
allowed him to experiment in rehears-
als, the freedom to ignore old habits
thus allowing every moment to unfold

rehearsing for weeks, and set has been
under construction since the beginning
of spring term.

“ The students have been wonder-
fully committed to the project, and my
leading lady, Adrienne Bryant, has been
touchingly patient with the rantings
and ravings of her scene partner,” said
Martinez.

Lady Macbeth will be played by
sophomore, Adreinne Bryant from
Richardson, Texas. Bryant, a theatre
and history major has performed in
three other productions at W&L

A long standing fears of actors in
the production of Macbeth is, “The
Curse.”

One is never suppose to say the
name ofthe "Scottish king." There is a
tradition of tragedy on the production
sets of Macbeth.

If one does acidentally say the
dreaded name, there is a ritual that can
be performed which may lessen the
bad luck.

According to A] Gordon, you should
either turn around three times, and spit
or spit three times and turn around. ‘‘I
never can remember which, so I al-
ways do both just to be sure.”

Macbeth will play at the Lenfest
Center's Keller Theater May 19, 20, 21
and 22. The show begins at 8:00 p.m

Kiss Caruso’s movie career gooo|—bye

 

Kiss of Death — {:7 1/2

When David Caruso left TV’s NYPD Blue for a career in
the movies, one name kept popping up: Shelly Long. Many
were certain he was making the same mistake she had,
thinking his success on prime—time would translate to big
box ofﬁce sales.

With Kiss of Death, an uneven thriller also starring
Nicholas Cage, Caruso has failed to prove his critics wrong.
Although his performance is adequate, the movie as a whole
is a let down and very reminiscent of a TV show.

Roughly based on the 1947 movie ofthe same name,Kiss
of Death is_the story of Jimmy Kilmartin (Caruso), a minor
criminal in a world of crime. When he gets a wife and child,
though, he decides it’s time to settle down and straighten
out.

Unfortunately, his friends and relatives are still criminals
— and, like Al Pacino in The Godfather, Part II], he gets
pulled back in. Jimmy only intends to do one more quick job
as a favor to his loser cousin Ronnie Gannon (Michael
Rapaport), but he gets caught and is sent to prison.

All he wants is to leave the undewvorld behind and make
a new life with his infant daughter Corrina. However, the
police know they’ve got a useful informant, and they de-

mand he work undercover to capture the local crime bigwig,
Little Junior Brown (Nicholas Cage). The rest of the ﬁlm
revolves around his attempts to escape both the police and
the criminals unscathed.

Certainly David Caruso’s role will be highly scrutinized
by the critics, to see if he made a good decision leaving the
small screen for the big. Frankly, I’m not so sure this was a
very decisive performance, one way or the other.

On the one hand, about half of the time he seemed to act
with a careful, restrained humility that the role clearly
deserved. The rest of the time, though, especially in the
close-ups, his acting seems to break down.

He reverts back to old television techniques, exaggerat-
ing his actions with a melodrama that seems to forebode an
imminent commercial break, as if he’s got to keep us riveted
to the television so we won’t change channels. In other
words, he often seems to be forcing the emotion and char-
acter development. Nevertheless, I would rather withhold
judgment on the success of his transition until he ﬁlls
another role.

At any rate, the supporting actors are all absolutely top-
notch. Michael Rapaport (True Romance) does an excellent
job as the extremely annoying Ronnie. Other former
Tarantino stars include Samuel Jackson and Ving Rhames,
both fromPulp Fiction, the former as the sympathetic police
officer Calvin and the latter as the mysterious Omar.

And at any rate, it doesn’t matter much how good the
supporting actors are — the ﬁlm is completely stolen by
Nicholas Cage as the moody and asthmatic sadist, Little
Junior Brown. He brings an intensity and insecurity to his
characterthat rivals the psycho-characters of J ack Nicholson,
Dennis Hopper or Christopher Walken.

Despite this dominance, the ﬁlm ultimately fails, as a
result of the sketchy script. Penned by Richard Price, well
known both as an author and a screenwriter (The Color of
Money), it is surprisingly poor. Very much like Caruso’s
acting, it seems more like television than film; the scenes
develop too quickly and the transitions are simply are
incoherent. When this film is ﬁnally broadcast on television,
they will have no problem inserting commercial breaks
between these disjointed scenes.

The only really riveting scene is the ﬁnal showdown
between Caruso and Cage, where director Barbet Schroeder
(Reversal of Fortune) does an excellent job keeping the
action in focus and understandable, without losing any of its
impact and force.

Ultimately, this ﬁlm will be remembered for the excel-
lent portrayal given by Nicholas Cage, which keeps us on
the edge of our seats. Whether it will also be remembered as
the first or merely the only film of David Caruso’s career
remains to be seen.

ﬁﬁfzﬁ-Go by this as soon as it comes out on video. It is an instant classic. “You'll
laugh; you'll cry; and maybe, jusl maybe, you'll learn so " 5 about yourself."

ﬁfth’-Go see this film now, while it's still on the big screen. It's worth a few Oscar
nominations Ind the seven bucks you'll pay if you see it outside Lexington. Overall, “Better
than Cars!" '

ﬁﬁ-Okay, so there have been better ﬁlms. Nevertheless, it is a good example of its
genre, and you should probably see it on videotape. Srill, probably “Better than Cats!”

1}-It happens to be on HBO, and you‘re blowing off tomorrow's reading. Although your
time would probably be better spent on your education, its free and you're bored, so go ahead
and watch it.

0-Even if its free and your best friend said he never laughed harder, trust me, this one

The Ring-tum Phi, May 12, 1995

Clint illing-tum Iﬁhi

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

Frolicking

The last week of Spring Term evokes contrasting
emotions. Our time here is almost over. We want to
have fun, enjoy the good weather, and spend time

 with our friends before we go home. On the other

hand, we have long papers to write, finals to study
for, and lots of boxes to pack. We all know we should
be responsible, but sometimes it’s hard. What should
we do?

The Phi has the answer: Frolicking.

Last night in the midst of deadlines, editing, and
laying out the beautiful paper you now hold, the sky
opened up in a huge downpour. We spontaneously
took off our shoes, raced out of the office, and ran
across the Collonade in the pouring rain. It was
beautiful. It was cathartic. It was exactly what we
needed. ’

Write your papers. Study hard for your finals. Be
responsible. But every once in a while, take a break.
Dance, play, be silly, and most of all frolic.

Frolicking, Part Deux

It was a dark and stormy night. Well, it was.

The sky did, indeed, open up again. And like the
bolt of lignting that crashed ouside the window of
the Phi office, we bolted out the door, down the hall,
and into the rain to frolic yet once again.

The idea did come up that our entire editorial
board, plus two kick—ass staff writers, could get
arrested for drunk in public and indecent exposure.
A new experience for all concerned, except Dan
Odenwald of course. Although he wasn’t actually
arrested for indecent exposure.

When we returned to the office, the storm became
violent and crashed our computers. The front page
was now a thing of the past. But we were saved by
extraneous staff member and computer guru, Ethan
Krupp. The omnipotent one shared with the staff
some very valuable advice that we’d like to pass on
to our readers: Save now and save often.

Quote of the Week...

“Whaddaya gonna do with the haid?!”
“What?!”

“Who’s got the feet?!”

“Pete ’s got the feet! You want the haid?!”
“Yeah, I want the haid!”

ii barbecuers on the morning of the D-Hall ’s “PigRoast/

 Volleyball Tournament”

Student body diversity about real World

 
 
   

MATTIIEW I
GRAVES, ’98

This article is being written in re-
sponse to two articles which appeared
in the May edition of The Spectator. The
two articles are entitled, “An Argument
for a Homogeneous Student Body” and
“The Myth of Diversity.” While I be-
lieve that every university should strive
toward a diverse student body, in this
article, I am going to focus on Washing-
ton and Lee and these two articles. '
The first argument presented in “An
Argument for a Homogeneous Student
Body is that “[a] general lack of respect
or even awareness of the school’s his-
tory and the speaking tradition are com-
monly touted aschanges that have taken
place in recent years.” I would agree
with the writer of this article on this
assertion. There have been many days
when I have walked down the Colon-
nade and only received blank stares
after I said, “Hello.” However, I can see
no logical correlation between this de-
cline and attempting to increase the di-
versity of this student body. The writer
of this article attempts to equate the
decline with “a [lack of] companionship
and camaraderie that arise[s] from ho-
mogeneity.” However, this is only the
writer’s opinion and there is no evi-
dence to support his assertion. From
personal experience, I can ﬁnd no com-
mon underpinning to those who have
ignored our traditions at this school.
The next argument which is pre-
sented by the writer of this article is that
“similarity...allows people to relate to
one another.” He argues, “These traits

allow people to become friends and
associates.” Once again, I would have
to disagree with this assertion. Does
one really have to be similar to someone
to have a friendship with him? While
the reader may have his or her own
answer, I would say emphatically, no.
My personal experiences at Washing-
ton and Lee have led me to this conclu-
sion. I have a diverse group of friends,
some of whom I have next to nothing in
common with.

well. Forcing people together does not
necessarily make them hate one an-
other. Every person that comes to Wash-
ington and Lee, or any other college, for
that matter, is technically “forced” to be
together with people they do not know
and may or may not like. I disagreewith
any assertion which says that whether
these people forced to live together get
along or not depends upon their simi-
larities ‘to one another. I would wager
that every reader could think of one

how seniors who  now in a In“The Myth of

have not spoken
with each other in
months socialize
and have a good
time.” He then
goes on to say that
this is less true
with the under-
classmen. Once again, I ask the reader if
this assertion is believable. From my
standpoint, I know that while at Fancy
Dress and Zollman’s shows, although I
did spend a majority of my time with
my fraternity, I did take the time to see
some people whom I had not seen for a
while.

The next assertion is the only one
with which I agree. The author writes,
“Forcing people together does not nec-
essarily make them like one another.”
While this is true, its converse is true as

college environment
rather than in the
real world?”

Diversity,” the au-
thor writes, “Many
contend that as
people are thrown
together with oth-
ers of a different
background, they
will gradually Ieam
tolerance and acceptance. This idea is
false.” The author’s proof of this asser-
tion is “[i]f this were true, South Afri-
can whites would be the least racist
people in the world.” The logic of this
assertion is definitely ﬂawed. There is a
difference between group interaction
and group co-existence. In group inter-
action, the diverse groups will associate
with one another and learn from each
other. In group co-existence, the groups
merely reside in the same areas. In the
case of South Africa, there were laws

forcing these groups to merely co—exist;
once these barriers were torn down, the
slow process of interaction began, and
the first sign of this was the new diverse
legislature of South Africa. At Wash-
ington and Lee, we have no such barri-
ers preventing us from interacting, and
once again from my personal experi-
ence this interaction has been positive
for both me and those with whom I have
interacted.

The writer of these two articles seems
to believe this push for diversity exists
simply to increase the school’s standing
in U. S. News and World Report, but I do
not see this as the reason for a push for
diversity (it is merely another beneﬁt of
this push). The true reason for this push
for diversity is the interaction of which
I spoke previously. My contention is
that our education at this institution does
not end when we leave the classroom.
We constantly learn about life during
our time here.

College should provide the unique
atmosphere of allowing people to inter-
mingle with people of all races, reli-
gions, beliefs and backgrounds. Every-
one should have at least one friend or
associate from the aforementioned
groups. I do not claim that it is always
easy to find common ground with people,
but is it not better to start trying now in
a college environment rather than in the
real world? It is easy to remain ignorant
of the other groups besides one’s own
while at almost any college. However,
the world is becoming increasingly
smaller, and it is becoming more com-
mon for people to have to deal with
people from different backgrounds than
their own. I maintain that any college,
including Washington and Lee, should
be a place where one changes his or her
egoistc tendencies and attempts to see
thing’s from other people’s perspec-
tives.

Little screwdrivers and broken glasses

THE FAR MIDDLE
Alex Christensen

The other night, I was...uh...um...“hanging out”
in a friend's room until pretty late, and as I sat
talking, the little tiny screw on the left side of my
glasses came loose, dropping the lens into my lap.

(Looking at the paragraph I just wrote, I’m a bit
dubious about the prospects of this column, but
what about that headline, huh? Quite a grabber.)

Anyway, the first thing that came to mind, as
you might guess: “What I need is a little
tiny screwdriver.”

(Sorry I keep doing this, but I just have to
interject again here and say that even though this
whole deal so far sounds like a loosely related
string of sexual and alcohol-related innuendoes,
it's really a series of totally innocuous innuendoes
which only I and the seven-point-five people in the
world who run on my frequency will completely
understand. Fortunately, my pretext is fascinat-
ing. Onward...)

So there I was, late at night, halfway across
campus from my little tiny screwdriver, with my
lens in my lap. _

(I just have to cut in here once again and
reiteratetthese are not sexual innuendoes. But if
you do have any interesting sexual innuendoes,
feel free to type them up and mail them to me at
“aechrist@liberty.uc.wlu.edu”.)

Back to the story.While the glasses-free stu-
dents may not be able to relate, this kind of a
predicament is not the most pleasant to be
in.Everything looks warped and distorted and weird.
This can be good at certain times, but I just wasn't
in the mood, so I got up, excused myself, and
headed across campus from Gaines to my dorm

room high atop Graham-Lees Dormitory.

Of course I didn’t think about this at the time, but
looking back, it was about three in the morning, I’m
about six-foot three and 220 pounds. If I saw myself
coming toward me in the dark, squinting and being
very careful about where I set each next step, I might
be frightened. I tend to think of myself as younger
than everyone else all the time though. I don’t
conceive of myself as physically threatening at all.

So when I was almost home, out in front of
Graham-Lees just before the arch, I fell into step
behind this girl whom I did not know. Before I was
entirely sure what was happening (everything was
blurry and everything), this poor girl started running
full out toward the door and up the stairs.

Can anybody tell me just what the appropriate
response to something like that is?

At first, I was insulted. l’ve been contemplating
something on this subject for a long while. I have
noticed that a lot of times when I fall into step behind
a young woman, or even a couple or three young
women I don’t know, there is this palpable tension
that develops. It doesn’t happen most of the time,
since I know a lot of the people here, but I have
noticed it increasingly lately.

Then I remembered my mother, locking the doors
of our van with her mighty power-locks when she
would see people walking down the street by where
we were driving.lt happened to happen in an area of
town where the people who walked by would hap-
pen to be Latino, and so I associated it as sort of a
casually racist thing to do. I started to think about
that, and how it seemed paranoid to me and even
insulting to the people walking along. Those power-
locks make a very noticeable sound.

Every time she would do this, it would annoy me
more. Until finally, I began to understand why she
did it, when I was driving to school with my little
sister and this scruffy-looking guy walked by. My

finger went automatically toward that power-lock
switch and before I realized what I was doing, the
doors were all locked. What I was doing was not
racist or in any way directed against this man person-
ally (though the noise of the power locks is still
a bit much).

(I realize this sounds rather silly and perhaps a
bit...tortured, for lack of a better word—like an
overly sensitive liberal or something—but I am
trying to recreate my own thought processes here.)

Now, whenever I get in the car, I lock the doors.
If I forget to do it, I do it whenever I remember to,
whether I am reminded by someone walking down
the street or whatever.

So after thinking about that in relation to this
situation I thought to myself, and to this girl: “If you
need to run to make you feel more comfortable, go
for it.” It’s not an issue of insulting anyone or being
paranoid; it’s just a basic issue of feeling comfort-
able and secure in any circumstances.

I don’t know anything about what that girl thought 

or what prompted her breaking into a dead run, but 3327‘

I realize that, even on the other side of the equation, ":
I could probably be a bit more sensitive to the 1
feelings of others, regardless of the knee-jerk reac— 
tion it may provoke in me. It makes me laugh, now, , 3

thinking back on it.

But just know that most men, despite what some -i

may say, would never rape or otherwise assault any
woman. It’s simply so foreign and reprehensible a

thought to most men as to be completely ruled out. >1

And on the other side, it should be realized that

4

when a woman locks her door or walks with friends 3
or even runs for a safe place, even from a man or -

groupof men who untilthen were completely wrapped
up in where they left their little tiny screwdriver or
what their politics paper will be about, that’s prob-
ably just something she has to do to make herself
feel secure.

Awards that make this year worth it

DREAM LAND
Richard Weaver

With only two more weeks left of
school, it’s time (of course) to give out
the Second Annual Dream Land
Awards of Achievement. As with last
year’s awards, they were NOT decided
upon lightly. I spent nearly an hour
before dinner one day writing them up.
I don’t miss my feeding times, so if this
column is short, that ’s because I stopped
to go eat.

Criteria for the Dream Land Award
(henceforth known as the “Dreammy”)
include 1) Humor Value to Me, 2) If I
Remember It, and (new this year) 3 ) If
It Involves Food.

The ﬁrst category is Most Im-
proved Dream Land World Tour
Stop. The Dreammy goes to Minia-
ture Graceland in Roanoke, which I
visited last year. For those of you who
are unfamiliar with this landmark, it is
a small version of Elvis Presley’s home
that someone built in their front yard.

Elvis songs play in the background 24
hours a day. And the neighbors spend
their free time watching their property
values plummet.

Accompanied by Phi reader Paul
Byerly, I returned to Miniature

Graceland and was delighted to ﬁnd
Mr. and Mrs. Epperly had added a very
tasteful gold-looking life-size statue of
Elvis next to their front porch. From a
certain angle it could appear to be some-
thing out of Godzilla in that the statue
could come of its base and start walk-
ing across the little buildings, crushing

fer the “Happy Holidays” greetings
from their cars to unauthorized, law-
abiding parkers.

The Dreammy can also be a dubious
honor in the category of Worst Beer
Known to Man. This was given to
Coors’ Artic Ice, the beer too cheap to
afford the “c” in “Arctic.” It’s not often

them. Maybe thatlcommenton
even Elvis could the subject of bad
breathe ﬁre. beer, but this stuff

The Dreammy has got to be some

“Happy Holi-

violation. This is, indeed, a nice thought,
but, strangely, the officers put the ve-

the greeting, because maybe they had a
lot of time on their hands. Or perhaps
the ofﬁcers didn’t want people to trans-

new Taco Bell ﬂa-
vored Doritos. If you’re like me and
you often enjoy six or seven individual
serving size bags of Doritos, there’s
nothing better than that burrito after-
taste. One only wonders how long it
will be before we have McNugget-
ﬂavored Doritos or, better yet, Long
John Silver’s Doritos.

The Dreammy for Best Gum
Product goes to the makers of the
Game Boy Bubble Gum Trading Cards.
I must first explain my new fascination
withcollectingthingsmadeoutofgum.
Besides the Game Boy product, my
favorite is the compact disc I own made
out of gum. Anyway, the Game Boy
gum comes, of course, in a little
Nintendo Game Boy box. The gum is
also the same size and shape as the
trading cards inside, which could mean

"you’re might be in for a surprise if you

reached for a piece of gum in the dark.

This year’s ‘last Dreammy is for
Best Use of Student Funds, and
hands down the George Clinton con-
cert wins. W&L students, dressed in
their khakis, FD shirts, lacrosse hats,
and bucks got their money's worth
when they got to watch the multi-col-
ored dreadlocked President of Funk
strut on stage dressed in what appeared
to be someone’s old sheets, with men
in wedding dresses dancing in
the background.

Who needs the Glenn Miller Or-
chestra playing softly in the gym at
Fancy Dress when you can have Parlia-
ment Funkadelic reverb off the metal
walls of the Pavilion? And it was on a
school night, too!

Have a good summer, and buy me
some gum, would you?

Dean’s List and Honor Roll changes
amount to disincentive to students

An open letter to President-elect John W.

Elrod:

Dear Sir,

Recognizing as I do you are active educators of our
young adults and I am a parent of two of those students
and that our vantage points may be in opposition, I
would like to comment upon the faculty decision on
Dean’s List and Honor Roll grade point averages.

The Dean’s List and the Honor Roll are both
honorable achievements at Washington and Lee. Sim-
ply being in attendance at that prestigious University
is an honor. Have you considered that by making it
more difficult to achieve those honors might in fact
backfire and cause students not to try harder, but to
give up, considering the desire to achieve those goals

impossible? I have!

Reward for hard work is essential to continue in
any pursuit. Each of you is fully aware of that. If you
received less money for the same number of hours

all the faculty?

work you might possibly not put in quite the effort you
would if you received a considerable increase in
monetary remuneration. Thus my thinking in terms of
student effort. Why bother? Maybe this is a simplified
example, but basics are what we are talking about.
What exactly are we trying to tell these students? You
aren ’t as smart as you think you are? ...or in order to be
smart you must be smarter than the sum total of

Let’s think about the outcome. Do you want fewer
students graduating with honors? If so, why? Do you
want every student to know it is possible for him/her
to achieve honors at least sonre of his/her four-year
education at W&L? That might encourage each stu-
dent to continue the long hours to reach their goals. If
you make W&L an impossible place for a “well-
rounded” group of students to achieve success you
will no longer have a “well-rounded” campus. It has
been my understanding that you do not want to be-
come a Yale or Harvard where only the 1600 SAT
student can survive. Am I wrong?

I’m. not suggesting grade inﬂation so everyone
is on the Honor Roll or Dean’s List, but I do think
achieving that honor once in a while for everyone
certainly would boost student morale.

Life outside the campus will provide challenges
of greater proportion that this. I do realize in the
beach of sand which represents life this dilemma
perhaps could be classiﬁed as a single grain of

sand. Don’t turn it into a solid rock mountain. .. grains

of sand will do just ﬁne.

I am proud of each student at W&L and the
faculty who challenge them daily. All of you are
doing marvelous work. Don’t forget to congratu-
late each other often and genuinely. You will
continue to be surprised the rewards the “pat on the
back” and words of encouragement can bring.

...from a parent who will continue to be proud of
her W&L students whether or not they are
“honor” students!

Student Jihad
vandalism misquoted

To the editor:

The distinguished members of the Student Jihad, Lexington Chapter, would
appreciate a correction to last week ’s Ring-tum Phi. The sign that was left in
Washington Hall did not read, “We don’t give a s* * * about U. S. News and World
Report.” It read, “To hell with U. S. News and World Report.” The Student Jihad
does not condone the use of profanity on any of its signage. We would appreciate

more accurate quoting in the future.

"DXIKBACK

MY V-IEW
Steve Williard, ’97

A studentat Washington andLee
is presumed to act honorably at all
times. A sense of mutual trust and
respect surrounds all aspects of a
student ’s life at Washington
and Lee.

This statement on student con-
duct comes straight from the White
Book that every student pledges to
have read at the beginning of his
freshman year. Apparently, some
aspects of student conduct are j ud ged
to be exempt from these standards.
Our Honor Code that we boast of
and hold so dear apparently has
some gaps.

I have in my possession two stu-
dent body notices. I took them and
kept them because I didn’t believe
what I was reading the ﬁrst time.
According to one, a notice from the
Executive Committee, a student was
dismissed following a Student Body
Hearing for cheating on a set of
Chemistry problems. This young
man now has his transcript stamped
with the word ‘dismissed’ and has a
permanent black mark on his
record—for cheating on chemis-
try problems.

The second notice is what actu-
ally disturbed me the most. It came
from the Student Faculty Hearing
Board. The notice said all that
needed to be said: “The SFHB found
a Washington and Lee student in
violation of University policy re-
garding sexual misconduct, includ-
ing unwanted sexual contact, forced
sexual contact, and physical contact
with sexual intent.”

The frightening part ofthe notice
was in the second paragraph and
can be summed up in three words—
not kicked out.

While the penalty may seem
harsh to some (suspended from
W&L for a year with re-admission
contingent of counseling from both
a University and non-University
counselor, and banned from the Uni-
versity during the suspension), the
fact remains that this person was not
kicked out.

No violation of trust is too small
to be ignored, for we understand
that honor is not measured
by degree.

This statement also from the
White Book is, along with the ﬁrst,
preached to W&L students from the
day that they walk onto campus.

One professor referred to the acts
described by the SFHB notice by
saying, “That’s the ultimate viola-
tion of trust.”

The fact that the offending stu-
dent was not expelled is not only an
embarrassment to the University, it
is just outright in error according to
the standards of this community.

I definitely have my doubts re-
garding the single-sanction system,
but as long as it exists, let’s consider
the message that these two
notices send.

We are saying that cheating on
chemistry problem sets is a more
heinous offense than sexual assault.
Where is the equity in that?

Also, why are cases such as that
not dealt with by the EC? And I say
cases in the plural because I know of
at least one other notice of slightly
less strongly worded content. In that
case, the student was just not
even suspended.

Some will say that this was a

Honor vs. honor: 9
Single sanction
has no meaning

campus life incident and not in the ‘
classroom. However, another stu-
dent was kicked out of the Univer-
sity this year for lying to police
regarding a car accident, and be-
sides, what happened to the phrase
“surrounds all aspects of
student life”?

First of all, if someone commits
an act such as this, they do not
deserve to be at the University. If
we want to boast of our beloved ‘
honor code, then we should un-
equivocally revoke any privileges
that the offending student enjoyed
as a member of the
W&L community. »_

If we continue to deal with inci-
dents such as this as we have so far,
then we have no honor code, we
have a beautiful facade that we call
an honor code.

Sexual assault attacks the vic- 3'
tims at the very core of their being.
Recovery can be agonizingly slow
and painful.

Our society no longer tolerates
such behavior with an air of accep- *'
tance, so why should Washington
and Lee?

W&L is not the only school with
this problem. At the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a
track star plead no contest to rape. V
At first, he was not even going to be
removed from the track squad.

Then only a concentrated and
effective protest by the campus's
women’s groups kept him from 1,
being allowed to keep his four-
year scholarship.

I have also heard some say that
sexual assault is not a widespread
problem at W&L.

Anyone who says this is incred- y
ibly ignorant. I myself know of
instances of sexual assault, or in-
tense harassment. Also, what about
the rape that occurred in the dorms
last year? Whether or not a W&L P
student was directly responsible, it
still happened.

Reporting a case of sexual as-
sault is by no means an easy task.
Most victims just want to put it V
behind them as quickly as possible.

Returning to the immediate is-
sue of the student who was only
suspended for a year, if the SFHB
had it in their power to expel this ,
student, then we must seriously V
question the members of the board
as to why they felt sexual assault
warranted less of a punishment that
cheating on a test or, in the
case of the other notice, a
chemistry problems.

They are the ones who have to
sleep with their decision. I j ust hope
they realize how big a mistake
they made.

It is high time that the students 3
and other members of the W&L
community stand up and say that
this sort of behavior will not be
tolerated and will be dealt with as
the crime that it is. )

Honor and trust are constants,
whether it be at a fraternity party or
in the classroom. As long as we deal
with an issue like sexual assault
differently from cheating, then
we insult our sense of honor
and justice.

All I can do is lay out my opin-
ion, but until there is more of a
reaction to this sort of inequity, the
system will not change. If we even
want to claim the existence of an
Honor System, we owe it to our-
selves to deal harshly with those
who choose to steal the very es-
sence of their victims.

Winter scholar-athlete list numbers 71

By JOSHUA HESLINGA
Phi Staff Writer

At a time when tensions between
academics and all extracurricular or-
ganizations seem to be rising, there
stands one sharp contrast: Washington
and Lee’s Scholar-Athlete Honor Roll.

The list for the recently completed
winter term was recently announced
by athletic director Mike Walsh.

There were 71 honorees for the win-
ter term, bringing the total number of
athletes honored this year to 103.

Members of the list are participants
of W&L varsity athletic teams who
achieved at least a 3.5 GPA during the
winter term.

The harmony achieved between
mind and body this year has led to a
very successful year for scholar-ath-
letes. W&L has had seven athletes
named to the GTE Academic All-Dis-
trict teams through the fall and winter
seasons.

Sophomore volleyball player Eliza-
beth Bahn, a native of Olympia, Wash-

ington, was named to the GTE Aca-
demic All-America third team.

W&L’s sports teams have also re-
corded great successes. W&L has won
59% of its sports contests (as of May
10), and the Generals have captured a
record seven Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championships.

The teams that took home ODAC
crowns were men’s and women ’s cross-
country, golf, men’s lacrosse, women’s
swimming, women’s tennis, and
women’s track.

In the friendly team GPA competi-
tion for winter term, the women ’s cross-
country team Scored top honors with a
phenomenal 3.411. The highest men’s
team GPA was also the cross-country
team with a 3.209.

These two groups have clearly put
to rest the notion that one must be crazy
or stupid to run such long distances for
enjoyment.

In all, 10 out of 20 W&L sports
teams recorded GPAS above a 3.0.

Scholar-athletes actually com-
mented that playing varsity sports in-
creases needed personal discipline.

Senior lacrosse player Nicole
Ripken, recently honored along with
teammate and fellow scholar-athlete
Carrie Niedereras first team All-ODAC
selections, commented, ‘‘It just means
you have to balance your time a little
better. l’ve always had time for both,
though.”

Freshman tennis player Natalia
Garcia, who recently became the first
W&L woman to ever reach the semifi-
nals of the singles NCAA Division III
tennis championships, remarked that
her difficulties in balancing sports and
studies faded after the beginning of the
school year.

“It was actually good [for me],”
Garcia stated. “It helped me when I got
out of class to have to go play tennis. It
was a real stress-reliever.”

Both Ripken and Garcia also dis-
agreed with the recent notion that
W&L’s high academic standards hurt
the school in comparison to other
ODAC and nationwide teams.

Garcia noted, “Those schools that
don’t have the pressure definitely have
more time to train, but I don’t feel it’s

that big of a disadvantage. Anyone
who plays tennis does so because they
like it, and they don’t really have other
[more important] motivations.”

Most importantly, Ripken and
Garcia also found that faculty and staff
in both academics and athletics showed
understanding of the pressures involved
in balancing the two.

‘‘I think they both know that you
have commitments to both, so they try
to be reasonable,” Ripken reﬂected.

Other notable scholar-athlete hon-
orees included: sophomore swimmer
Nathan Hottle, NCAA Division III
champion in the 200-yard breaststroke;
senior lacrosse player Shaun
McKenzie, a candidate for All-America
honors; and juniorlosephine Schaeffer,
who has twice won All-America hon-
ors in cross-country, and has also pro-
visionally qualiﬁed forthe1995 NCAA
Division III outdoor track champion-
ships.

These honorees are reminders that
it is possible to participate well both
inside and outside the classroom si-
multaneously.

Senior Nicole Ripken will wind up her lacrosse career
in the North-South game on June 9 at Johns Hopkins.
Ripken, the Generals‘ 3rd all-time leading scorer, will
be one of the seven attack players on the South squad.

Their career together began
rather inauspiciously.

As individuals, they had each
garnered both national and inter-
national recognition. Teamed
together, they did not know what
to expect in the ooming year.

On their first day as doubles
partners, freshman Natalia Garcia
turned to her elder partner, senior
Marilyn Baker, and said, “Don’t
be afraid to tell me anything,
because I don’t know what I’m
doing.”

Nine months later, Washing-
ton & Lee women’s athletics
earned its first ever national
championship on Monday, as the
doubles team of Baker/Garcia
brought the NCAA Division III
title home to Lexington.

The third-seeded duo won a
three set match, 6-3, 5-7, 6-2,
over the second-seeded team of
Alice Han and Tracy Erickson
from Gustavus Adolphus in the
championship match at Sweet
Briar College.

The win was the third straight
three-set victory for the Generals
tandem en route to the champi-
onship, and it was no easy ride.

Along the way, Baker and
Garcia posted a 6-0, 7-6 win over
Hope, and a come-from-behind
3-6, 6-0, 7-5 win against a team
from Luther to set up a semifinal
battle against the defending na-
tional champions from Williams
College.

Baker was familiar with the
Williams pair of Becky Mallory
and Julie Greenwood, having
faced them in March with junior
Helen Chandler, while Garcia
was away, playing in the Federa-
tion Cup for her native Domini-
can Republic.

It was not until that match that
Baker and Garcia felt a national
championship was within their
grasp.

“That morning, before the
Williams match, we decided we
could win it,” said Baker.

The Generals took the first
set, 6-4, but were defeated in the
second set, 6-2.

In the decisive third set, Baker
and Garcia did not even make it
close, blowing out the defending
champs, 6-1. '

Baker believes that the con-
secutive three-set victories gave
her and Garcia confidence as they
went along, instead of wearing
them out.

That confidence would show
again in the final.

The W&L duo cruised out to
a5-1 lead inthe opening set. Han
and Erickson, though, refused to

give in, and battled to win the
next two games, but the Generals
managed to close it out for a one
set lead.

In the second set, Baker/
Garcia jumped out quickly to a 2-
0 advantage.

The Gustavus team again put
up a gritty defense and took four
games in a row.

The see-saw affair continued
as W&L won the next three for a
5-4 edge, and was within one
game of the championship.

With their backs to the wall,
Han and Erickson once again re-
fused to quit, and fought back to
win the set, 7-5.

“That was a heartbreaker,”
said Baker of that second set.

So Baker and Garcia had to
once again dip into that third-set
experience for what would be
theirﬁnal set togetheras a doubles
team.

“We had a mental edge, I
think,” Baker said. “But, also, I
think our desire to win was greater
than theirs.”

Although they dropped the
first two points of the decisive
set, the W&L pair won the first
game, and then broke Gustavus’
serve all four times in the set.

A Garcia forehand down the
line on match point ended the
incredible run and began the cel-
ebration.

“[Being a national champion]
feels really good!” said Baker,
who is a four-time NCAA par-
ticipant in singles.

“I don’t think l’ve really com-
prehended that we’re NCAA
champions, yet. Right now, it’s
more important for me to say I
won my last match. You’ve got
to feel good knowing you’re go-
ing out a winner.”

Both Baker and Garcia were
already proven winners long be-
fore they added a national title to
their collection.

Garcia, at age 14, won the
German Open. She has fre-
quented international tourna-
ments, was named the
Intercollegiate Tennis
Association’s regional Rookie of
the Year, and finished the NCAA
singles competition in the semi-
final match.

Ironically, Garcia had never
played doubles before coming to
Lexington and pairing up with
Baker.

“She’s capable of doing what-
ever she sets her mind to,” said

We are the champions!

Senior Marilyn Baker, along with freshman

championship this week at Sweet Briar College.

her admiring partner.

As for Baker, her collegiate
career could hardly have ended
any better.

She helped the Generals to a
third-place finish in the team
competition,eamingtheﬁrstever
NCAA trophy won by a W&L
women’s team.

In the singles tournament,
Baker * advanced to the
quarterfinals for the second time,
and ended her career with ex-
actly 100 victories.

Finally, Baker, last year’s re-
cipient of Tennis Magazine’s
Arthur Ashe Award was this year
named the ITA Player of the Year.

Her next stop is the Van
DerMeer’s Tennis Academy in
Hilton Head, SC, where she will
train full—time and participate in
semi-professional tournaments,
with the hopes of qualifying for a
pro event.

The 1994-95 season could
hardly have been a better one for
the W&L pro ram.

The 21-2 enerals finished

third in the nation after beating
Trinity (TX) last Friday, 5-4.

W&L’s only two losses came
against national champion
Kenyon, 5-4 on both occasions.

Against Trinity, Washington
and Lee won two of the three
doubles matches.

However, singles got off to a
bumpy start as everyone except
sophomore Anna O’Connor lost
their first set.

O’Connor won her match in
stright sets, 6-0, 6-1. Baker (lost
the first set, 6-4), and freshman
Ericka Shapard (lost the first set,
6-0), came back to win their
matches in three sets to lead the
Generals to the victory.

The completion of the team
tournament also marked the end
of the careers of seniors Melissa
Malone and Cathy Gartin.

Gartin posted an 11-2 singles
record this year, and finished her
W&L career with an astounding
35-4 mark.

During their four years as
Generals, Malone, Gartin and
Baker saw the W&L women’s
tennis program emerge from a
mere regional threat into a na-
tional power.

In recognition of her team’s
achievements, head coach Cinda
Rankin was named the ITA’s
Coach of the Year.

Rankin ’s seven-y ear record as
head coach stands at 127-22, and
the likes of Garcia, Shapard, Julie
Ayers, Shelly Sunderman, and
O’Connor, ensure that the Gen-
erals are bound to be a national
power for years to come.

Yet, for Baker and Garcia,
their one year together will not
soon be forgotten.

Major-league baseball has finally re-

turned.

The players’ strike, which eradicated
the remainder of the 1994 season, also
deprived us of the opportunity to follow
some of the best divisional races in recent
memory. When the season suddenly shut
down on August 12, three of the divisional
leaders possessed advantages of one game

or less.

We were also unable to see the play-
offs, which were supposed to expand to

include four teams in each league.

Since we never found out how last
season turned out, predicting the outcome
for this season becomes increasingly

tougher. However, I’ll give it a shot.

The Phillies are a prognosticator’s
nightmare. They were picked to finish last
in 1993, and won the NL pennant. Last
year, with expectations again high, the

Phillies ﬂopped to fourth.

In 1995, many have chosen them to
ﬁnish last. So where are they currently?
Philadelphia has the best record in base-

ball at 15-5.

The Phillies own one of the best of-
fenses in the National League, and thus
far, their patchwork piching staff has held
up. Although the Braves are heavily fa-
vored, as long as the bullpen doesn’t keep
blowing up like it did with a 7-3 lead in the
9th inning at Florida on Tuesday, the
Phillies could do the unthinkable and run
the gamut. And Mitch Williams isn’t even

around anymore...

As if Atlanta didn’t have enough talent,
it acquired Marquis Grissom. The Braves
began the season by burning out to a 6-1
record, but then were promptly swept at

home in four games by the Phillies.

Still, Atlanta’s starting pitching is
clearly the class of the league. Nor-
mally that would be a recipe for a
championship, if it weren’t for a bullpen
that is currently the front-runner for the
Steve Bedrosian Most Blown Saves in
a Season Award. Also, the Braves’
lineup is fairly young, meaning that
Dave Justice, who recently pierced his
navel, will be counted on to be a club-
house leader.

Montreal was the best team in base-
ball in 1994. That is until management
decided to open a Wal-Mart in
Montreal, and practically gave away
Larry Walker, Marquis Grissom, Ken
Hill, and John Wetteland. The Expos
still return plenty of young talent, led
by Moises Alou, but it is very unlikely
Montreal will come close to last
season’s performance.

Florida, with Gary Sheffield and
several key free-agent signings, looks
to contend one of these years.

The Mets actually have some life,
and are no longer the pushovers they
were in 1993. However, their main
goal for 1995 is to cease being the butt
of Letterman jokes.

a

NL£en.tr.aL

As they did in 1994, the Reds and
Astros should once again battle it out
for ﬁrst place.

Cincinnati by far starts the best
lineup in the division, but its pitching
drops off sharply after Jose Rijo and
John Smiley. A 1-7 start to the season
didn’t help much.

Houston, with Jeff Bagwell and
Craig Biggio, possess some of the best
young players in the league. A solid
pitching staff should guarantee that the
Astros will be in the hunt.

Chicago has gotten off to a hot start,
but the Cubs don’t have history on their
side; they haven’t won a World Series

 

since 1908. Maybe on the 50th anni-
versary of their last pennant, “The Cubs
win! The Cubs win!”

St. Louis vastly improved its pitch-
ing during the offseason and could be
a factor.

ls Pittsburgh ever going to ﬁnish its
rebuilding?

This division is the most wide-open
in baseball, with all four teams
conceivingly having a chance to win it.

line, but
until

they ﬁnd a bullpen and replace Jose
“E-6” Offerman at shortstop, they will
not win it all.

The Rockies have an offense that
could outscore the Broncos, and are
playinginanew park, Coors Field. All
the elements for a division title, until
one sees a staff 5.15 ERA in 1994.

Although San Francisco boasts
Barry “Me First, I Second” Bonds, and
Matt Williams, who was on pace to
threaten Roger Maris's single-season
home run mark in 1994, the Giants’
starting pitching requires prayer to en-
dure the season. Rod Beck may be the
best closer in baseball, though.

It would seem San Diego is ﬁnally
heading in the right direction. Then

    

one sees 7,000 fans in the stands, and
the ancient Fernando Valenzuela on
the mound. At least Tony Gwynn
might hit .400 this season.

This division should shape up as the
best in the American League, with as
many as three teams competing for the
one wild card berth.

The Yankees are a no-brainer pick
here. Jack McDowell joins a team that i
already owned the best record in the
AL last year.

The addition of Andy Van Slyke
and closer Doug Jones should eventu-
ally pay dividends for the Orioles, al-
though it hasn’t thus far. However,
more eyes will be on whether Cal
Ripken is able to break Lou Gehrig’s
consecutive game record this year.

Boston and Toronto both start po-
tent lineups, although the Red Sox are
without the injured Jose Canseco.

Of course, the Blue Jays will re-
ceive another chance to defend their
1993 World Series title. Paul Molitor
will attempt to bat over .300 for the
11th consecutive season.

This all means Detroit will need
divine intervention to stay out of the
cellar again this year.

This should ﬁnally be the year that
Cleveland steps up and captures the
division crown. It is hard not to like the
Indians, with rising stars such as Albert
Belle and Kenny Lofton. Jack Morris
even retired, too.

Despite whatever Big Hurt that
Frank Thomas may inﬂict, the White
Sox replace Darrin Jackson and Julio
Franco’s 149 RBIs with Chris Sabo
and Mike Devereaux. Hmm...

Milwaukee defied small-market
logic by storming to the best record in

baseball at one point, but why doesn’t
the rest of the AL seem frightened yet?

Kansas City attempted to change
itself into Montreal West by dumping
the salaries of Brian McRae and ace
David Cone.

Minnesota probably wishes the re-
placements were still playing.

I’m going to defy conventional logic
and predict that one of these teams will
finish with a winning record this year.

The Rangers, who finished first in
1994 despite a 52-62 log, are the best
candidates. However, their perenni-
ally loaded offense always manages to
underachieve, as it has early on this
season.

Seattle, with two superstars in Ken
Griffey, Jr., and Randy Johnson, will
hang in the race, and will try once again
to win its first-ever division title.

Oakland is enjoying a blast from the
past with the signing of pitcher Dave
Stewart, and Mark McGwire’s power
resurgence. But the A’s need another
huge season from ageless closer Den-
nis Eckersley to make some serious
noise in the AL.

That brings us to...California. This
ragtag outfit earned the dubious dis-
tinction of finishing last in this pathetic
division in 1994. Somehow, the An-
gels have managed to grab the early-
season lead, and in this wacky division,
stranger things have happened.

If nothing else, the signing of Mitch
"Wild Thing" Williams should inject
some energy into this franchise, and
put some fans in the stadium, whether
or not they cover their faces with tow-
els and throw toilet paper.

One thing is for sure: as long as the
Wild Thing is hurtling off the mound
somewhere, there will never again be a
dull moment in baseball.
