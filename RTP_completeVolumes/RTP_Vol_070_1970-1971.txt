Class of 1974
Rated ‘Strong’
LARGEST EVER

Freshman Dorms Include
Two Former Fraternities

The entering freshman class is
one of the strongest academically
and one of the most diverse in other
characteristics ever admitted to
WEL, according to admissions di-
rector James D. Farrar.

The 384 students, composing the
largest freshman class ever, ranked
in the top 21 per cent of their sec-
ondary school classes on a statistical
average, he said. One year ago. the
WAL freshman average was four
points lower.

The average scores on the sian-
dard Scholastic Achievement Tests
(SATs) for the class of 1974 were
610 on the mathematics section and
574 on the verbal, according to the
admissions director.

Of the new freshmen, 68 per cent
graduated from public high schools
and 32 per cent from private schools.

Thirty-four states and the District
of Columbia are represented in the
entering class. Virginia sends the
largest number of students, 98;
Maryland has the second largest rep-
resentation, with 36.

Two vacant former fraternity
houses are being used as dormitories
for 42 members of the freshman
class.

The need to place entering fresh-
men outside the main university
dormitories arose this spring when
an unusually large number of young
men accepted admission offers.
‘Though the university was more se-
lective in offering admission than a
year ago, the proportion of those stu-
dents who decided to attend W&L
was up more than five per cent.

The KA house, located about two
blocks from Washington and Lee's
main campus, will be called “Nelson
House.” The SPE house is about
three blocks from campus, and will
be known as “Preston House.”

Aside fro mthe freshman class,
there are other new people and
things in the W&L works this year.

In years past, when new siudents
had relatively little to about

Huntley Sees Broad Pessimism

BY ROGER MUNSICK

President Robert E. R. Huniley
warned Washington and Lee students
of “the fragile nature of the educa-
tional enterprise” during the course
of the University’s traditional Open-
ing Assembly conducted yesterday
at noon in Evans Dining Hall,

Huntley, after welcoming the stu-
dents back, expressed his thoughts
on the atmosphere of college open-
ings throughout the country in this
particular “new September”, stating
that the usual tone of anticipation
may well have been replaced by an
“atmosphere of tension and gloom”
among the academic community.

In contrast to the outwardly bleak
picture on a national front, Huntley
cited the vast potential that is Wash-
ington and Lee’s for the upcoming
year. The faculty and students, it
appeared to the president, are “more
knowledgable and aware” than ever
before. The student body has, after
vast amounts of work, the oppor-
tunity for new curriculum programs,
as well as chances for “self-develop-
ment” outside the classroom.

Opening Term Sees Faculty I ncreased
As University Announces 14 Additions

Fourteen new professors have
joined the Washington and Lee fac-
ulty for the 1970-71 academic year.

Dr. William W. Pusey Ill, Dean
of the College, said 10 of the newly
named faculty members will teach
in the university’s arts and sciences
division. Dr. Edward C. Atwood Jr.,
dean of the School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics, announced
one new appointment, and Dean
Roy L. Steinheimer of the School of
Law announced three.

E. William Johnson will join the
staff of the economics department
for the 1970-71 year to replace a
professor who will be on leave.
Johnson, who is currently complet-
ing work on his Ph.D. degree at the
University of Virginia, will hold the
rank of insiructor at WAL.

The President stated that in place
of ordinary school opening “annoy-
ances,” other, more sinister factors
are present at this particular time.
“Instead of fellowship, there may be
alienation and humorless isolation:
instead of scholarship, there may be
rude epithets and hollow self es-
teem.”

Huntley saw several broad rea-
sons for “the special pessimism”
gripping campuses today. He ac-
knowledged sociological studies that
found youth alienated from the
American society, questioning injus-
tice. He recognized surveys attribut-
ing canmypus unrest to a breakdown
in family unity and in religion.

The financial crisis confronting
the universities was also cited as a
cause for alarm. College administra-
tors are constantly queried by pro-
spective donors as to the value of
educational institutions existing
amidst turmoil.

The final portion of the Presi-
dent’s address dealt with the com-
ments of Robert Nisbet, a professor
of sociology at the University of
California at Riverside. It is the
particular nature of educational
freedom that it is susceptible to a
chipping away of values by militant
minorities, individuals who ignore
authority. “Power,” President Hunt-
ley warned, “is the invariable re-
sponse to shattered authority.”

Universities, Huntley said, can-
not merely witness their own de-

J. Sanford Doughty, former direc-

In another development office
change, Maj. Gerald E. Poudrier of
Lexington, a member of the Wash-
ington and Lee University’s Reserve
Officer Training Corps staff since
1966, became director of annual
giving in W&L’s development of-
fice, succeeding William C. Tyler.

Doughty, as associate director,
will share responsibility for the over-
all operation of W&L's development
activities with Farris P. Hotchkiss,
director of the office since 1967,
Hotchkiss will begin spending more
time preparing and carrying out
special projects, President Huntiey
said in making the announcement,

Poudrier, in the capacity of direc-
tor of annual giving, will supervise
operation of the Parents’ Fund and
be responsible together with WAL’s
Alumni Association for the Alumni
Fund. In addition, Poudrier will

the development office on a wide
range of special projects.

struction, yet at the same time he
opposes “a proliferation of policy
statements, rules which dehumanize
and brutalize institutions.”

As he pointed out in his Com-
mencement address of 1969, Hunt-
ley stated again that “Washington
and Lee is not a microcosm.” He
added, however that “this campus
need not politicize itself.”

In conclusion, President Huntley
told the University that “to trust
much is to risk much,” and called
upon students to accept this chal-
lenge.

Huntley’s remarks were preceded
by a series of introductions conduct-

Law School Men
Named to State,
National Posts

Two Washington and Lee men
have recently been honored with
government appointments.

Dean Roy L. Steinheimer Jr. of
the School of Law has been named
to head a special White House task
force investigating ways of explain-
ing the American legal system to the
country’s children.

Andrew W. McThenia Jr., an as-
sOciate professor in the School of
Law and legal advisor to the col-
lege, was named to the Virginia
Water Control Board by Gov. Lin-
wood Holton.

Dean Steinheimer'’s 15-member
panel is expected to complete its in-
vestigation and to submit a report
and recommendations to the White
House Conference on Children and
Youth, scheduled this December.

His committee's report, together
with findings of other Children and
Youth Conference study teams, will
then be submitted to President Rich-
ard Nixon,

Dean Steinheimer said his group
is “plowing new ground” in carrying
out its assignment. “Very little has
been done so far in trying to educate
American children on the sources of
law and the reasons for having
laws.”

The group will emphasize bring-
ing the message of law to pre-high-
school children, Dean Steinheimer
said,

Mr. McThenia, appointed to the
Virginia Water Control Board for
a four-year term, is a lawyer spec-
ializing in environmental protection.

Mr. McThenia teaches courses in
legal approaches to preserving the
environment and natural resources,
contracts, equily, and federal anti-
trust laws.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
September 17, 1970

A Birthday For The Newspaper
With That Funny Name

Ring-tum Phi, stickeri bum,
We're hot stuff from Lexington.
Rah, rah, rah, White and Blue,
Whoopla, Whoopla, W.L.U.

Sounding more like the name for a pre-school fraternity
than for a student newspaper, The Ring-tum Phi acquired its
awkward title from this college cheer which was popular in
1897, Though the cheer has been long and perhaps thankfully
forgotten, our name has remained—if nothing else as a lasting
tribute to the power of the press.

Though The Ring-tum Phi was not published for three
years during World War II, the publication of this edition
marks its official 70th birthday. We have chosen therefore to
reprint a copy of our very first edition to commemorate those
students who, over the 70 years of the newspaper's existence,
have found some inexplicable entrancement with the simple
act of putting lead type and wood blocks into a metal frame.

They loved every minute of it. So do we.

About Volume LXX...

The Ring-tum Phi is 70 years old now—officially. For us as
for many, this little morsel of information might as well be in-
cluded in an almanac for cocktail chatter were it not for a
slight shade of difference between the facts that The Ring-tum
Phi is 70 and there are over 85,000 species of flies. And that
shade of difference is shrouded in a mysterious word: “pride.”

On page three of our Number 1 is a facsimile of the first
The Ring-tum Phi ever published. Though its contents make it
somewhat of a curiosity rather than an historical document, we
can well imagine that the editors of the 1897 rag sensed a rather
elusive and somewhat archaic phenomenon: “school spirit.”
Roughly translated in the argo of today’s “with-it” generation,
the men of 1897 took pride in their University.

Intrinsically, we find much the same motivation for the
publication of Volume LXX, although we write about quite a
different University than the one of 1897. To say that 1970
is a landmark of changes for Washington and Lee is almost an
understatement. Freshmen did not board the buses for Na-
tural Bridge this year but remained on campus for a four day
orientation on campus. They along with the rest of the student
body registered for a three term academic year. And they are
attending classes with women. (Would the editors of the 1897
Ring-tum Phi be agast if they knew the 1970 newspaper edi-
tors allowed a woman on their staff?)

Significant and valuable changes have been wrought for
the University. Yet the process of experimentation has only
begun. It remains to be seen whether coeducation will be an
enduring academic and social asset for the Washington and
Lee community. With the miniscule number of women on the
campus this year, we doubt whether their presence will make
an impact significant enough to be evaluated.

Will the 12-12-6 program enacted this year prove to have
all of its highly touted advantages over the school’s traditional
two semester system? This too is an experiment which must
be studied and reviewed as the year progresses.

Thoughtful, careful, almost tedious planning went into
W&L’s co-educational and short term experiments. And no
doubt more experimentation is to be made. Washington and
Lee has entered a most critical point in its long history—one
which requires the sort of enthusiasm which the 1897 editors
felt for their school coupled with the judicious thought and
appraisal which characterizes President Wilson's inaugural
address before the University.

As Washington and Lee's weekly student newspaper, The
Ring-tum Phi then as now is dedicated to serving the Uni-
versity’s students, faculty, administration, parents and alumni.
We hope to provide a forum for the expression of opinion by
anyone within the university community, and we trust that
then as now, you the reader will “lay down a part of your time
and money in order to advance the fame of your alma mater.”

1970: The Y

BY JOHN ROBINSON

The Freshmen class of 1970 will
be the first group to experience sev-
eral substantial changes on the Wash-
ington and Lee campus. Among
these changes are a new curriculum,
eliminaiion of a Natural Bridge-
based Freshman Camp and a defer-
red rush system. Let’s examine these
changes briefly and evaluate their
merits and faults,

First and foremost of all changes
is the renovated curriculum. The se-
mester system has been sacked in
favor of a three term academic year.
The fall term ends before Christmas.
This is a terrific improvement be-
cause now freshmen will be through
with exams when the December

 

     

BY GREG RAETZ

For over a century fraternities
have been an integral part of the
student life at Washington and Lee.
Traditionally, the vast majority of
students have joined fraternities and
stayed in them through their four
years here.

However, in the past two years,
and particularly in the last year, the
trend has been away from fraternity
affiliation. For the first time in de-
cades fraternity membership is be-
low 50 per cent of the student body.
Last year three fraternities dissolved
in one form or another and there
are persistent rumors that more will
follow this year.

Why? There are a number of rea-
sons, but there is one often forgotten
which seems to tie many of the
others together. The reason is sim-
ply that faculty and administration
are anti-fraternity.

There have been several occur
rances in the last year that come to
mind that tend to highlight this fact.
Last September dorm students were
given weekend parietals, but it was
half a year later before fraternity
residents were given the same privi-
leges.

The first night of formal rush this
fall a combo with Hollins freshmen
was held in the University Center.
Coincidence? Perhaps the most dif-
ficult challenge that fraternities will
face this year is deferred rushing
Without the revenue from pledges
for two months several fraternities
face financial disaster.

Anti-fraternity sentiment seems

Through a Spyglass Darkly . . .

The Rush From Fraternity

break comes. Likewise the winter
term concludes prior to the Easter
break and the short spring term of-
fers a unique opportunity for either
concentrated study or research out-
side of Lexington.

The new curriculum also means
more flexibility to incoming men. In
previous years the freshman year
was crammed full of required dis-
tribution courses. This is no longer
the case. Starting this year, a fresh-
man can enroll in several courses in
his major field. Also, more electives
are available to the Class of 1974,
meaning a broader field of study
than ever available to students at
WAL,

In general, the remodeled curri-

sstentestececas

to stem from the belief that fraterni-
ties are “too” conservative, and
therefore roadblocks to “higher edu-
cation.” The selective methods of
choosing their memberships and
their “closed” nature are often at-
tacked, They are even criticized for
being “anti intellectual”. (Maybe it’s
because some fraternity members
wear coats and ties and not the “in-
tellectual” dirty blue jeans and slept-
in shirts.)

No one is trying to say that fra-
ternities are perfect, but they aren't
sO Obsolete that they must be dis-
carded either. They have and they
must continue to change with the
needs, hopes and goals of the men
who make up their memberships. As
long as they can do this, they should
survive,

Just about the only alternative to
fraternities is university-owned dor-
mitories for the entire student body.
Besides the great expense of building
such fraternities, they would do
nothing to alter the bonds which
exist between all men of similar in-
teresis and goals—and, after all, isn’t
this what fraternities are made of?

 

culum spells out several benefits to
all students at W&L. First, the flexi-
bility is increased by reducing the
number of distribution requirement
courses. Secondly, the specialized
study possibility is greater improved
by the six-week term in April and
May.

However, these changes have nec-
essitated some inconvenience. The
most obvious of these is afternoon
classes, Another is more frequent
class scheduling conflicts. Often-
times, required courses are not offer-
ed each of the three terms. Despite
these mentioned problems with our
new curriculum, the advantages
greatly overshadow any problems
brought with the new plan.

For two decades all freshmen
have endured three days in Natural
Bridge called Freshman Camp, The
accommodations were bad and the
presentations were worse. It seemed
obvious that there was a basic fall-
acy in holding orientation in Na-
tural Bridge—how can you intro-
duce freshmen to the Washington
and Lee University by sending them
away from the campus?

Reason has finally prevailed this
year and orientation was conducted
at the Lexington campus, primarily
at the Student Center. Nonetheless,
several problems arose, Presenta-
tions were poorly attended and no-
body seemed in charge of the whole
operation, The Executive Commit-
tee, and its University Center Orien-
tation Committee, along with Focus
were all active but none seemed tre-
mendously organized. Granted that
this was the first time that orienta-
tion was held in Lexington, but some
basic errors were committed, The
plan was laudible, the execution left
quite a bit to be desired. Some in-
dividual must take complete charge
of orientation for everything to
come off smoothly.

Finally, the once powerful frater-
nities were struck a hard blow this
year. Deferred rush was put into
effect and the results may be termi-
nal for some houses.

It was felt by many that WAL’s
fraternities conducted rush too soon
Over too short a period of time.

 

ear of the Guinea Pig

Therefore, the faculty instructed the
Interfraternity Council to establish a
deferred rush plan, The number of
open houses and rush dates remain-
ed virtually unchanged. The only
major change is that rush dates are
held one night every week until late
in October. This boils down to
stretching a one week system out for
six weeks.

During these six weeks, the most
ridiculous rule is the no contact
order, Freshmen cannot go see fra-
ternity men for fear of “dirty rush”,
This rule will not hurt upperclass-
men nearly as badly as it will injure
the freshmen, It seems that this sys-
tem handicaps the freshmen that de-
ferred rush was specifically designed
to benefit.

So freshmen are to be the guinea
pigs of three new systems at W&L.
All three, the new curriculum, fresh-
man Orientation, and deferred rush,
have obvious merits. But all have
obvious faults, faults that must be
cleared up in the future.

Gas was chosen because it burns

Catise a gas heating plant is less ex-

Goodby.

 

We say it for an hour or for years;
We say it with smiling, say it choked with
tears;
We say it coldly, say it with a kiss,
And yet we have no other word than this:
Goodby.

We have no dearer word for our heart's friend,
For him who journeys to the world’s far end
And scars our soul with going; the way we
say
As unto him who steps but o’er the way:
Goodby.

Alike to them we love and those we hate,
We say no more in parting. At life’s gate
To him who passes out beyond earth’s sight,
We cry, as to the wanderer for a light:
Goodby.

 

Show Your College Spirit—
Have You Done Your Duty
in This Respect?

There are some things which, though not
put down in the catalogue as a part of the
student's duties, every one should do.

The first of these things is the joining of
the Athletic Association. Athletics at Wash-
ington and Lee never had a brighter outlook
than this season, Last year we had good ma-
terial on our teams, and they played well to-
gether. The only thing which kept us from
having a more glorious success than we did
have was the lack of support of the student
hody. The managers were unable to make the
dates, which are needed for a successful sea-
son, because of the lack of money. Let this not
be the case this year. You can rely on the
managers to do everything in their power to
get good dates, but we cannot expect them to
pay all the guarantees out of their own poc-
kets,

Last year the football manager had to pay
*sinety odd dollars from his own funds in
-order to meet the expenses of the team and
the baseball manager had to forward nearly
as large a sum. Every man who does not join
the association is responsible in part for this.
Mr. Lisle, the manager of the football team,
has been at work ever since last spring secur-
ing games. He hopes to have our team play
the University of North Carolina, Roanoke,
Richmond college, Kentucky A, and M., col-
lege, University of West Virginia, Louisville
Athletic Club, Vanderbilt, and Sewanee, be-
sides our series of games with our neighbors,
the Cadets. Whether we play all of these

games remains to be decided by you.

Opportunity to earn cash money
in your spare time. We have a limit-
ed number of openings for special
banquet waiters,

Contact Mr. Darrell or Cy Dillon
at Evans Dining Hall,

No experience required.

Second. If you would have us win all of
these games, get out on the field and buck up
against the first team. They need a lot of

fellows to give them strong practice.

Third. Subscribe to our monthly literary
magazine, the Collegian. The Collegian ranks
among the first of the college magazines, and
it remains with you whether it will continue
so, Not only should you help the Collegian
by subscribing, but every student should write
for it, so that the editor will have a lot of
good material to select from.

Fourth. You should join one of the literary
societies. They need you, but you need them
much more. If you will go to the Graham or
the Wash, at its first meeting, join, always be
in your place, always do well the work assign-
ed you, you will find at the end of the year
that you have gotten more good from it than

from any ticket you have taken.

Fifth. You should be bubbling over with
college spirit. Be ever ready to support every
good scheme gotten up. It is the fellow that is
full of enthusiasm that makes his mark. In
looking over an old catalogue the other day
we noticed that it is the fellow who took in-
terest in everything around him at college
who is doing the best in the world. Nor let the

thought enter your head that the good stu-
dent is the fellow who leaves all of this out-
side “stuff” alone. The honors at last com-
mencement were nearly all taken up by men
who are prominent as fellows who are ready
at any time to lay down a part of their time
and money in order to advance the fame of
their alma mater.

 

It was with a bosom filled with pride that
the Judge stood on the steps of Newcomb
Hall as our fine, new, red, four-wheeled, two-
horsed sprinkler passed before his admiring
gaze. It takes two men to run this sprinkler.
One drives, the other sees that the water
doesn’t spill. The sprinkler is a mark of pro-
gress, however, and it will lay the dust if it is
only given the time. So don’t laugh.

 

Ain't that sprinkler warm?

Closing Sentences of President

Wilson’s Address

The following are the closing sentences
of the inaugural address of Hon. William L.
Wilson yesterday at Washington and Lee:

If the South is to produce for her own serv-
ice, if she is to contribute, as in days past, to
the whole country statesmen, legislators, and
judges, able to maintain her influence and
proper dignity as a great section of the Ameri-
can union, her sons must continue to give, as
Mr. Blaine declares their fathers gave, “deep
study to the science of government,” and if
amid the hard conditions that confront them
after leaving college they are no longer able
to give that study in the seclusion of their
own libraries, the proper foundations for it
must be laid in the schools of learning.

Let it not be understood that such studies
are designed to train recruits for any partisan
camp, still less to mould them to the views of
any teacher. | am no disbeliever in sturdy
partnership that seeks through political or-
ganization the highest good of the country ;
but it is to generate and develop the desire
and the power of independent, original re-
search, to foster the habit and the ability of
independent judgment; to acquaint men with
the origin and the historic growth of our in-
stitutions, with the fundamental principles of
government, and so to enrich them with the
results of human experience that they can
decide on this or that policy as it may
strengthen or weaken our freedom, this or
that economic doctrine as it may advance or
impair the general welfare ; above all to make
them intelligent and strong leaders, not ser-
vile and ill-informed followers of public opi-
nion or selfish beneficiaries of popular delu-
sions,

This is not only to advance the cause of
high education but the cause of free govern-
ment, by helping to retain and to prepare for
the service of the country that “better mind
which is said to be growing more and more
alienated from the highest of all sciences and
services the government of it.” For such edu-
cation the examples and inspirations are all
around us ; nowhere more than in the past his-
tory of this commonwealth, or in the names
associated with the origin and past history of
this school.

We throw away the richest part of our en-
dowment if we do not bring these examples
and inspirations to the education of our young
men; if we do not mould into their very sta-
mina the patriotic princples of those fathers
and those founders and those illustrous peo-
ple or the past, and such loyalty to those prin-
ciples as will not barter or surrender them
to any ambition for personal advancement or
to any fear of personal consequence. They

need to learn that it is harder to preserve
freedom in peace than it is to win freedom in
war ; that it is as disloyal and as shameful to
falter or desert in the one struggle as in the
other; and that it may require a courage as
high and thoughtless of self as that which
nerved William Campbell and his fellow stu-
dents of a century ago to scale the slopes of
King’s mountain,

Neither can we pass over to others, no
matter how fair and honest they may be, the
task of writing our own local history ; of vin-
dicating and establishing the just credit and
contribution of our state and our section to
the achievement of American independence,
to the founding of our constitutional govern-
ment, to the expansion of our territory or to
the past greatness and glory of our Union.
Still less can we pass over to others, however
patriotic and capable they may be, any share
of our own part in the task and duty and the
abiding honor of governing our common
country, of perpetuating its freedom, of pro-
moting its prosperity.

Our youth must have the same educational
training as the youth of other parts of the
country to fit them for leadership, a leader-
ship based upon the broadest, most enlighten-
ed and American statesmanship, and in this
training Washington and Lee University is
called upon to take no minor part among the
schools of the South and of our beloved
country.

And now, Mr. Rector, I have taken the
oath which the statutes of this college require
you to administer to its president elect. I have
taken it with no reservations and with no illu-
sions, but as stated in my formal letter of ac-
ceptance, with the lesson learned in the hard
school of life, that no great duty can be met
without great effort, patience and singleness
of purpose. These I hope to bring to the of-
fice to which the trustees have called me. |
know that by this oath I take my place in a
line illustrated in the past century and a half
by great abilities and great virtues. To recall
with discriminating praise all who have pre-
sided over this University is a task for which
I am not competent. To mention some would
be invidious, but there is one name which
stands out on the roll of the world’s greatest
men as the symbol of the highest virtue and
most perfect manhood that human nature
has ever attained. The inspiration of that
name and the memory of his lofty character
will always linger as a noble educational in-
fluence around this college, revived and per-
petuated as they have been in recent years
by his worth son. No man deserving of your
choice could assume in any vain or self-suffici-
ent spirit the leadership of an institution en-
dowed by George Washington and once ad-
ministered by Robert E. Lee.

Football Cuts...

Old jinxes never die, it seems. At
Washington and Lee, the knee in-
jury jinx keeps striking the football
captains. Three years ago, it was
punter Rudd Smith, wiped out at
mid-season. The next year, both co-
captains, John Wolf and Scott Mac-
kenzie, finished the year on crutches.
Last year, center Michael (Thunder)
Thornton missed most of the season
with a banged-up knee. And last
week the jinx struck again as co-
captain and linebacker Drew Kum-

Neer

Continiutes
Stardom

“Want to sign a contract to play
professional ball this year in Italy?”
Basketball star Mike Neer said yes.

Neer, a 6-7 center who graduated
in June, will leave next week for
Bologna, where he will be the only
American on the Bologna team
which competes in a 12-team Euro-
pean professional league.

“I’m really excited about it,”
Neer commented from his Alexand-
ria, Va. home. “I’m real happy to be
getting a chance to play professional
basketball, and financially, it will be
super. Besides, it ought to be a lot of
fun,”

Neer was recommended for the
Italian pro league by Bob Cousy and
the general manager of the Cincinn-
ati Royals, Joe Alexson. Neer made
an impressive showing while attend-
ing the Royals’ rookie tryout camp
conducted by Cousy this summer ia
New Hampshire. Scouts from the
Italian league first saw him there
and were impressed.

“Mike looked real good and show-
ed a lot of promise,” Alexson said
from the Royals’ front office in Cin-
cinnati. “But we felt the transition
to forward in the NBA would be
just too much for him at the present
time.”

Alexson indicated that with some
professional experience behind him,
Neer might make the grade in the
NBA. Neer played center for W&L
and admittedly must work on his
outside shooting to play forward.

“The ltalian scouts were impress-
ed with my jumping abiilty,” said

Mike Neer

now a pro

Neer, “In the Italian league, it’s
legal to block shots above the rim
and to stuff the ball.”

Several current professional stars
have played in the Italian League,
including Bill Bradley while a
Rhodes Scholar in England, Terry
Driscoll and Doug Moe. Driscoll,
now with the Boston Celtics, was the
American player on the Bologna
team last year.

“Driscoll told me it was really a
great deal,” Neer said. “The Ameri-
cans are treated as real celebrities in
the towns where they play.”

But they also can get the equiva-
lent of the Italian bum’s rush, “At
the end of the year,” Neer said, “the
two last-place teams are demoied to
the minor leagues and the two best
minor league teams move up. If you
finish last or next-to-last, they run
you out of town.”

Football Team Meets
E&H On Saturday

The 1970 Washington and Lee
Varsity Football team opens the
season Saturday on Wilson Field as
the Generals play host to a rugged
Emory and Henry squad.

The Generals will be relying upon
the superior speed and quickness of
their interior linemen to overcome
the always mammoth Emory and
Henry defensive line which averages
220 pounds. Tackles Steve Hannon
(190) and John MeNeil (210) and
guards Andy Smith (170) and Cap-
tain Stamen Ogilvie (188) provide
the experience in W&L’s offensive
line.

Sophs Tom Van Amburgh and
Steve Fluharty are trying for the
starting quarterback role while hard
running JoJo Martin fills the full-
back slot. Bill Wallace, a 6-1’ 175
pound freshman could get the nod
at halfback come game time.

Bruce Green, an Associated Press
all-state selection last year, returns
at flankerback. Green’s 25 pass re-
ceptions last year also netted him a
spot on the 1969 all CAC team.
Steve “Chief” Mahaffey returned to
Washington and Lee again this year
to complete his final year of gridiron
eligibility. Mahaffey pulled in 33
passes last season for 371 yards and
3 TD's.

Defensively, the Generals can
count on Scott Neese, (205) and

Dave Laughlin (200) at the tackles,
while Al McWhorter (200) and Mike
O'Donnell (195) hold down the end
positions.

The linebacking corps of George
Harris, Frank Evans, Tim Haley and
Ken Carter, is potentially one of the
finest in the south. Co-captain and

linebacker Drew Kumpuris has been
sidelined by a knee injury which
will keep him out of action.

All state selection Dave Brooks
heads the defensive secondary,
Brooks rewrote the record books

last year when he picked one off
against Washington and raced 101
yards for a touchdown in Busch
Stadium. The other veteran in the
secondary is soph Marshall Wash-
burn who will be counted on to
combat Emory and Henry’s aerial
game.

rhe last time Emory and Henry
came to Wilson Field they snapped
a 21 game General winning streak,
Their man to watch is number 38,
Wayne Neese, a Little All-American
fullback who last year wrecked
enemy defenses as he became one of
the south’s leading rushers.

Saturday's game could easily de-
cide the mythical small college state
championship since both W&L and
Emory and Henry are the pre-season
picks to top the rankings. Kick off
time is 2:00 for what should prove
to be a good game.

Next week—Towson State.

Executive Committee Establishes
Study of Budget and Constitution

Several new committees were es-
tablished by the Executive Commit-
tee in its first meeting last Monday
evening. While in session the EC
also set a slate for an Open Forum
of student complaints and sugges-
tions.

Initially, the University Standing
Committees made informal reports
concerning their projected needs
for this year. The University Center
Committee failed to make any such
report,

Student Body President, Fran
Lawrence, established a new com-
mittee to study the budgeting of the
funds allotted to the EC. Both Joe
Tompkins and Phil Thompson will
serve on this group.

After brief discussion between
President Lawrence and junior Glenn
Azuma, a Community Relations
Committee was founded, Further
discussion and selection for this
committee were postponed until
September 28.

Senior Staman Ogilvie and junior
Glenn Azuma will head the com-
mittee approved in Monday’s meet-
ing. They will examine the need and
feasibility of a constitutional revi-
sion. ZF

It was announced by the EC that
an “Open Forum” will be held on
the afternoon of September 30. Fran
Lawrence stated that this forum was
designed so that “anyone can bring
anything up for discussion.” This
kind of approach will be an attempt
to duplicate the Bitch-ins of former
Student Body President Jay Passa-
vant.

The Passavant “Bitch-In” was con-
ducted in duPont Auditorium in No-

vember of 1968. A group of about
50 students gathered to air com-
plaints at the EC sponsored func-
tion. Several student body officers,
including current EC members Sta-
man Ogilvie and Joe Tompkins, took
part in the discussion.

Finally, it was disclosed that two
“workshops” will be held by the EC
after its meeting September 28. One
“workshop” will deal with the prob-
lem of a constitutional revision. The
second workshop concerns the gen-
eral allocation of the EC’s funds and
more specifically the establishment
of a budget.

Harland Foundation Endows Contact

Matt Cole, Chairman of Contact,
announced Tuesday the gift of $1000
to the Contact committee by the
John H. Harland Foundation.

Contact is the week-long sympos-
ium designed to discuss key issues
of the day. The organization annu-
ally brings vital speakers to the
Lexington campus. This year the
program will explore “The Expand-
ing and Changing Role of Higher
Education.”

Cole explained that since speakers
this year are generally charging fees
on the average $250 higher than
last year, the gift will be used to sup-
plement student funds to maintain
the high quality of speaketrs in the
past. In addition, Cole expressed the
hope that the Contact committee

will be able to present more speakers

than last year.

President Robert E. R. Huntley
issued a statement expressing his
pleasure with the announcement:
“This generous gift from the John
H. Harland Foundation is a source
of great encouragement to all of us
at Washington and Lee. It comes, at
once, as a recognition of the high
quality of commentary and partici-
pation that past Contact programs
have provided, and as an inspiration
for our students to continue to us
this kind of forum for the useful ex-
ploration of important, timely ideas.
I know all of us are grateful for this
vote of confidence in the potential
of Contact and its student leader-
ship.”

Cole, upon receiving the gift, re-
marked, “The committee deeply ap-
preciates the interest that the John
H .Harland Foundation has shown
in the university and in Contact. An
unrestricted grant of this size helps

 

to re-inforce the idea that students
and adults have a common goal in
education. And though the gift com-
prises only about one-eighth of the
total Contact budget, it certainly
goes a long way in insuring the suc-
cess of this year’s program.” Cole
further stated that the Committee is
continuing to raise the balance of
the $8500 budget from students, par-
ents, and the IFC.

Two Teachers Cited

Dr. James Graham Leyburn and
Prof. O. W. Riegel of Washington
and Lee University have been select-
ed to appear in the 1970 edition of
“Outstanding Educators in Ameri-
ca,” an annual volume honoring
teachers of exceptional achievement,
dedication and service throughout
the nation.

Both Dr. Leyburn, professor of
sociology and anthropology, and
Mr. Riegel, professor of journalism
and communications, were heads of
their academic departments until re-
tirement from administrative duties
in recent years. Both continue to
teach full time.

Dr. Leyburn came to Washington
and Lee in 1947 as dean of the uni-
versity, a post he held until 1955.
Before coming to Washington and
Lee he had been professor of socio-
logy at Yale University.

He earned his bachelor of arts de-
gree in 1920 from Trinity College
(now Duke University), a master’s
degree in economics from Trinity in
1921, a second master’s degree in
economics from Princeton Univer-
sity in 1922, and his Ph.D. in socio-
logy from Yale in 1927.

He has taught at Hollins College
and Princeton as well as at Yale
prior to joining the faculty at Wash-
ington and Lee.

‘aa Visa Free University Will |
Be Offering Courses This Year |

A poetry reading by Professor Dabney Stuart next week-
end will begin the fall Free University activities here.

Last spring, in conjunction with
other student activity, a “Free Uni-
versity” program was established.

IFC Studies Food Buying

Tuesday night's Interfraternity
Council saw the beginning of discus-
sion On a cooperative food-buying
plan, which is designed to save the
fraternities money. Mr. Jerry Dar-
rell of Evans Dining Hall introduced
the plan last week, but did not pre-
sent full information at that time.

Mr. Darrell’s plan, which he said
was one of personal interest to him,
provides for twice-weekly orders
and deliveries. Although he expects
to be able to provide most foods
eventually, he explained that only
meats, frozen vegetables, and gro-
ceries would be available at the be-
ginning. The plans calls for having
bills paid and orders placed on time,
both of which serve as a built-in
safety device so that fraternities will
not be faced with large outstanding
bills, as many were at the end of last
year.

City Tags Now Required

BY SKIP PAUKERT

Washington and Lee students will be at-
taching Lexington city tags to their automo-
biles for the first time this year. The Lexing
ton City Council has enacted the much dis-
cussed student licensing proposal, requiring
all students possessing cars here to purchase
an initial tag for five dollars and then another
ten dollar tag next spring.

The five dollar tags will be available at
the City Treasurer's Office at the Lexington
City Hall after October 1, 1970, and will be
ood for a six month period, Then the ten
dollar tags, effective for a twelve month per
iod, must be purchased after March 15, 1971,
and no later than April 15, 1971, City officials
intend to enforce the measure with the pen
alty of a considerable fine,

“The purpose of the student tags ts purely
financial,” insisted the Mayor of Lexington,
Douglas E. Brady, “We feel the tax ts justi
fied, since students use the streets just as
much as the city residents do.”

Lexington’s Commissioner of Revenue,
Mr. 1. C. Baker, estimated that the student li
censing world yield the city six thousand dol
lars during the coming budgetary year, Th

money from the student tags, just as tha
from the local residents’ tags, will be deposit
ed in the Lexington general fund, to be ear
marked for no particular expenditure

The only students exempted from buying
the city license are those whose cars bear tage
from Virginia municipality. The City Council
has not yet resolved, however, what provision

and VMI,

who otherwise would be compelled to pay ten

should be made for seniors at W&1
dollars for the twelve month tag with less
than two months left before their wraduation

The idea of student auto licensing origi
last May,

tudent repre

nated in a City Council meeting

which was attended by two
sentatives, I, C, members Staman Ogilvie
and Phil Thompson The Commissioner o
Revenue, Mr. Baker, had then pointed out that
the city of Charlottesville had

both auto licensing and assessment of per

undertaken

sonel properties to apply to University of

Virginia students
\t that time Ogilvie and Thompson ceded
the justification for the licensing of vehick

but requested the proeprty tax be waived for

students

Their contention was that a distinetio

must be made between resident who are

dent of each fraternity and the IFC
representative of each fraternity.
Both would be allowed a vote; fines
would be levied for those not in at-
tendance.

President Doug Gossman called
for a meeting of the presidents and
treasurers of each fraternity Thurs-
day at 7 p.m. to discuss financial
matters of the IFC.

Since May, several people have
been working to establish Free Uni-

Haughney and Dr. Thomas Imeson,
Assistant Professor of Biology, have
been particularly active in this effort.
Working in co-operation with the
Bakery Free Library, Haughney and
Imeson have been collecting basic
ideas for the program's operation.

This year’s Free University plans
are to expand from political topics
to a wide range of interest areas.
The reason for this emphasis shift
is to give students (and any other
interested persons) an opportunity to
study or experience fields outside of
the academic realm.

The programs will be open in at-
tendance and direction to those both
inside and outside the University.

Other than the Stuart poetry read-

Rockbridge County
Now Levies Taxes
On W@L Students

BY NED MOORE

Rockbridge County officials today
made notice to all out-of-state Wash-
ington and Lee students who own or
operate a motor vehicle within Rock-
bridge County to purchase a 1970
County license decal on or before
October 1, 1970, or face county pro-
secution.,

Under a recent ruling by the At-
torney-General of the state of Vir-
ginia, anyone, including college stu-
dents, living in a Virginia county
for more than six months out of a
year is considered a resident for tax-
ing purposes. All residents of Vir-
ginia display their county decal
along with their state inspection
sticker on the windshield of their
car. Failure by a resident to own or
display a Virginia county decal
sticker is subject to fines of not more
than $100 and not more than 30
days in jail.

This law, the Motor Vehicle Li-
cense Tax Ordinance of Rockbridge
County, is not new. Until the resi-
dency requirement of six months was
established by the state's Attorney-
General, students had been exempt-
ed from all residency expenses.
Starting in 1971 the Rockbridge
County decal will have to be pur-
chased annually at a cost of $10 by
April 15 of each year.

The 1970 decal has been pro-
rated for the next six months at a
cost of $5. Decals may be purchased
by WAL students at the County Of-
fice Building on Main Street.

REVIEW and OutLooK Reflections Upon Entering W&L

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Some Books Are Missing...

McCormick Library is not often thought of as a center of
student activity. There are no cigarette machines or juke boxes.
Food and drink are not allowed inside the building. Yet stu-
dents do congregate in the library because there are books—-
about 217,000 of them. Or rather, 216,992.

This past May, several students and librarians discovered
eight reference volumes missing from the library, ones which
may not be taken out of the building under any circumstances.
According to University Librarian Maurice D. Leach, the
books in question are from sets of reference volumes which are
sold by distributors as a whole, not separately. Below is a list
of the missing volumes and the estimated cost of replacing
each set in order to recover the missing volumes.

The possible monetary depletion from the library's book
purchasing budget does not concern us as much as the disturb-
ing fact that these books were taken from the library without
any authorization and have not been returned as yet. That this
may be an honor violation is only a conjecture, for the details
of the removal of these volumes is not known, The constitution
of the student body authorizes the Student Library Committee
to investigate such matters; and they are at present attempt-
ing to ascertain who may have taken the books.

Our primary concern is not a black-on-white indictment of
a handful of unknown figures who for, all we know, may have
mistakenly walked off with these volumes. What we are much
more concerned about is the future of the honor system, one
which depends upon the integrity and character of the student
body to uphold it.

What sort of honor system would the Washington and Lee
student body have if there had to be a monitor at the door to a
reference room to insure the safety of valuable books? Mr.
Leach has indicated that the library cannot afford many more
losses such as the one described above, and that a checker at
the door may be necessary in the future. What sort of honor
system would the student body have if the rear door to the li-
brary had to be locked to remind students, to have their books
checked out?

The honor system is not a paper document. It is an attitude.
We trust that this attitude has not changed and we hope that,
in the case of the library, it will not become a phantasmagoric
absurdity.

On Logic and The City of Lexington

Washington and Lee and VMI students who own automo-
biles now can not only rejoice in the exhilarating spirit of com-
petition (i.e, by attempting to find a parking place in town),
but they can also count themselves as members of an elite
mobile landed gentry (i.e., by having to pay a property tax on
their cars).

The Lexington City Council has passed a motion which re-
quires that all students purchase a $5 city tag for their cars this
October and a $10 tag in March, Last May, the City Council at-
tempted to pass a property tax on students as well, but
Messrs. Staman Ogilvie and Phil Thompson put forth the ar-
gument that college students receive little benefit from the
community while they help to sustain the city’s economy. The
Council rejected the personal property assessment; instead,
another property tax, a tax on students’ cars, was instituted.

We find the reasoning behind the institution of this pro-
posal extremely faulty. If the Council sees fit to tax students
who have cars because they share the streets with local resi-
dents, we have no objection, Yet we do object strongly to
where the money is going. Logically, if the students from
W&L and VMI pay the city’s tax on their cars they should ex-
pect that the money obtained from the taxation should go di-
rectly into the city’s road maintenance budget.

Ilogically, the money is placed into the Lexington general
fund. Therefore the reasoning behind the tax is more of an
excuse than a justification, We ask the Lexington City Council
to set aside the estimated $6,000 revenue that will be accrued
from the tax for use in the maintenance and construction of the
city’s roads,

If the tax on students’ cars is to have a logical reason for
its institution, it should, by necessity, have a more logical sys-
tem in its implementation,

This feature deals with stimula-
tion: the stimulation of men’s minds,
It singles out individual faces from
our fluid masses to form a potpourri
of opinions given as answers to vary-
ing questions.

The following are the candid re-
sponse to the question asked in lieu
of the importance of September 17
(whatever that may be): “What is
your impression of Washington and
Lee?”

Bo Hopson, °74, Louisville, Ky.
“I enjoy it. I find it easy to live un-
der the honor system. There is time
for social life and academics are
easily accomplished.”

Matthew Towns '74, Chuckatuck,
Va. “People take simple situations
and make them difficult. At first
everyone was living on false pre-
tenses. Now people are living easier;
there is no compulsion to greet one
another. I was somewhat confused at
first, but now that I am becoming
familiar with university life, I think
it is a great school.”

John Luster '74, Natchitoches, La.
“It's ramifications are obvious. |
think it augurs well.”

Wayne Baker '74, Annapolis, Md.
“Lam not too much disappointed. I
have not had any lengthy assign-

ments. I do suppose that the exams
will be hard. The school aided me
during the summer and Dean John
has taken a sincere interest in my
course selections. The people here
show strong compassion,”

Steve Erikson °74, Philadelphia,
Pa. “Does anyone have a spare cig-
arette? I really don’t feel like going
to my room.”

Leslie Fox '72, Boston, Mass. (Ex-
change from Hollins). “Academically
it has given me many opportunities I
could not have gotten anywhere else.
Basically everyone here is nice. Hi!
Jim. There is some hostility towards

having females on campus from both
students and professors. I would hate
to see either W&L or Hollins go
coed, but the experimental exchange
program is fine.”

Dr. Porter, Assistant Professor of
History. “I've been here such a short
time that I am not sure that I can
give an answer. In the few times that
I have met my classes, I feet the stu-
dents are really top drawer. Return-
ing to W&L, I have noticed the dis-
appearance of a few traditions, one
such being that of greeting one an-
other. There appears to be a certain
lack of friendliness,

Dr. Bryant, Instructor in Biology.
“Washington and Lee as far as |
can tell from the short time i have
been here is very conducive to .earn-
ing. From the stand point of the sci-
ences, the big university has better
equipment than the smaller one.
This is due to government grants
and research projects,

“ve been quite impressed with
President Huntley and the beauty of
W&L. I might add that women
could do much for the atmosphere.

“One last thing, remind those peo-
ple at the newspaper office that |
have my Ph.D.”

Foreign Study Dreams Become Realities

BY PROF. DICKENS

Foreign study sponsored by Wash-
ington and Lee seemed a very re-
mote possibility a couple years ago.
Now, however, it is reality. In the
past it was possible for qualified
students to spend time abroad un-
der the auspices of foreign study pro-
grams offered by other colleges and
universities, Credit for their work
was transferred back to W&L as is
regularly done for summer work.

This year things have changed. A

McCormick Growth:
Books--& a Building

BY MACK WOODWARD

McCormick Library is beginning
its third year under the supervision
of Librarian Maurice Leach. The
past two years have been part of a
period of great change and growth
in the library.

For the first time since 1957, the
library budget has approached the
figure established by the American
Library Association. The Associa-
tion recommends that the library
budget allocated be somewhere
around 5 per cent of the total univer-
sity operating budget. The fiscal year
1969-1970 saw the increase to 4.9
per cent of the total University bud-
get by the library budget.

As well as an increase in budget
allocations, the library has increased
its volumes of books and magazines
considerably. During fiscal 1969-
1970, the library purchased 8428
volumes of books and 751 maga-
zines. This compares to 4471 books
and 672 magazines in fiscal 1968-
1969. Total money spent on books
and magazines jumped from $55,263
in 68-69 to $122,183 in 69-70,

The added purchases by the library
have increased the total resources
available to 225,263 books, 72,330
government documents, and 2331
microfilm reels in all the branch
libraries and the central McCormick
facility.

New features of library in the
past year include the purchase of
the microfilm reader printout which
enables readers of the microfilm to
make copies of the film. The library
has also, because of student demand,
been able to open earlier on Sunday
afternoon and stay open later during
exam periods.

The anticipation of a new library
facility has brought change to the
existing library committees. Last
year the chairman of the Student
Library Committee was appointed
to the Faculty Library Committee.
According to Mr, Leach, this has
proved beneficial to the Faculty
Commitiee as it has presented a stu-
dent's point of view in connection

with the library policy and the plans
for the new library.

The Library Building Committee
has been busy determining library
service policy matters, as well as
visiting other college library facili-
ties, including Colorado College,
Washington University, Amherst,
and Tufts, in order to determine bet-
ter how the new library should be
organized.

The new library, which is still in
the tentative planning stages, should
be a more modern, usable facility
that the existing McCormick struc-
ture. It will hopefully be organized
to be used as a teaching facility as
well as a research facility.

Work has been done this summer
to the archives room, and rare books
and the archives are one step fur-
ther toward classification and ac-
cessability. The Crenshaw Fund, es-
tablished last year in memory of Dr.
Crenshaw, will be available soon for
the use of more work in the archives.

One problem faced by the library
is the loss of books. Inventory taken
over the summer revealed that sev-
eral volumes of references books
had been removed from the library.
Removal of such books, which is a
violation of the library rules, is
causing a problem in that these
books are parts of sets, and cannot
be replaced individually; another
whole set of books must be ordered
as books cannot be replaced indivi-
dually.

Included on this year's Standing
Library Committee are Chip Harris,
Chairman, Mack Woodward, Stacy
Eastland, Marvin Brooke, John Tuc-
ker, Jim Zeppieri, and Bill Miller.
A freshman representative will be
chosen by the Student Body Execu-
tive Committee following Freshman
Class elections in a few weeks.

The group works closely with Mr.
Leach in sponsoring Library func-
tions, Included among these have
been several teas and visitations dur-
ing Parents’ Weekend. A program
for the Class of 1974 supervised
tours of McCormick Library during
Freshman Orientation Week.

number of W&L students will spend
the six-week spring term in France,
Germany, and Spain.

After many months of planning
that included a questionnaire that
sought to gather student ideas and
Suggestions about foreign study,
three W&L professors engaged in
“university business” spent part of
their summer in Europe to make ar-
rangements for the 1971 spring term.

Armed with facts, figures, and en-
thusiasm, Professors Drake (for the
French program in Paris), Williams
(the Spanish program in Madrid),
and Dickens (the German program
in Bayreuth) are now converting in-
tangible ideas and hopes into the
concrete realities of the spring acti-
Vities,

The programs are basically simi-
lar. Participants will live in families
of the host countries. They will at-
tend classes organized for them, run
partly by the accompanying W&L
professor and partly by teachers of
the foreign schools with which ar-
rangements were made this summer.

The formal classwork will con-
tinue language study; it will be sup-
plemented by special lectures design-
ed to enable the student to derive the
fullest possible benefits from his six-
week immersion in a foreign culture.

Bayreuth is a town of 64,000 lo-
cated in Northern Bavaria, easily
allowing for trips to Czechoslovakia
and East Germany. The town has no
concentration of foreign students and
presents, thereby, an actual view of
German life. Bayreuth is a reservoir
of rich cultural resources; its associa-
tion with Wagner will provide the
WAL students with in interesting
background. Toward the end of the
program, a five day excursion to
Nurnberg is planned.

A cumulative average of 2.5, the
completion of a second year langu-
age course, and the approval of the
Foreign Study Committee is requir-
ed of those students wishing to take
part in the program.

There will be time during the pro-
gram for independent travel. The

German students may find that there
will be snow still on the ground, So
they may be able to do some skiing
in the first few weeks after their ar-
rival in Bayreuth.

The six credits granted for success-
ful completion of the program break
down into three credits for language
work and three for a topic or inde-
pendent study project that the stu-
dent will have developed in advance
with the assistance of the department
of his major and the foreign langu-
age department concerned,

Day-long and weekend excursions
are planned to supplement and en-
rich the purely academic program,
but there will still be ample time for
the participants to move about on
independent voyages of discovery on
their own,

Complete details of the programs
are available from any member of
the French, German and Spanish de-
partments. The cost of the program
is $900, to be paid in addition to re-
gular full tuition. With the experi-
ence to be gained this year, it may be
possible to reduce expenses in the
future.

Because many advances must be
made, interested students should see
a member of the department in
whose department program they are
interested. Students interested in the
Spanish or French program should
contact those departments by Oct.
20, Those interested in the German
program should contact Professor
Dickens before Nov. 20.

A first-hand report on life and
study abroad will be available short-
ly from W&L students who spent
last year in France and Sweden. The
planners of the spring program hope
to benefit by the experiences of these
students in making plans for next
spring. An announcement of general
information, to be made in the
Cockpit, will be given shortly.

Students wishing to remain in Eu
rope after the programs end will re-
ceive a refund for the return trip.
They must make their own reserva-
tions for the return trip,

Letters to the Editor

Response to Raetz

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Though most of you were prob-
ably amused at “The Rush from Fra-
ternity” by Greg Raetz in last week's
The Ring-tum Phi, there may be
some who were deceived by the pres-
entation of the fraternity issue “thro-
ugh a spyglass darkly.” Thus, at the
risk of being obvious I would like to
answer the charges presented by
Mr. Raetz and bring out the more
pertinent issues in the anti-fraternity

movement,

Mr. Raetz first charges the admini-
stration with being anti-fraternity.
This all-encompassing generalization
is far from fair as is any overall in-
dictment of the fraternity system,
The truth lies somewhere closer to
the fact that there is a noticeable de-
cline in pro-fraternity feeling within
the administration. This, however,
does not mean that the administra-
tion is out to destroy the fraternity
system,

As Mr. Raetz so dramatically
pointed oul, the destruction of the
spirit behind fraternity can probably
never be completely eradicated. Part
of that spirit is human gregarious-
ness. However, the administration is
out to provide a pleasant alternative
to fraternity membership. Mr, Raetz
points out some of these efforts to
make life for non-fraternity men
more desirable. His attitude is that
this alternative is a direct attack on
on This sounds almost para-
noid.

Another revealing complaint for
Mr. Raetz is his attitude toward the
extended rush program. He says dis-
aster might befall the houses because
of the absence of freshmen dues for
two months, Any house standing so
freely that its existence depended on
the two months of freshmen dues
might be considered a poor risk for
freshmen seeking their haven of
happiness for the next four years,
The real disaster will probably be the
smaller pledge classes because the

freshmen will have had a consider-
ably longer look at the houses. It is
difficult to maintain that friendly,
frozen-faced facade for seven weeks.

Actually, it seems that Mr, Raetz's
analysis of anti-fraternity sentiment
falls quite short of piercing insight.
It seems that he is trying to misdi-
rect opinion from the real issues by
pointing to conservatism and anti-
intellectualism as the chief reasons
for anti-fraternity sentiment. Of
course anyone knows that you will
find conservatives and liberals, and
intellectuals and anti-intellectuals,
within any group,

The more real basic reasons for re-
jection of the fraternity system might
be widespread instances of hypo-
crisy, falsehood, dehumanization, an-
ti-individualism and materialism.
Now I want to make it clear that |
don't accuse the system as a whole of
being guilty of these charges. I do
charge that this type of action and
attitude is widespread.

There are fraternities who still
have the image and ideal of what a
fraternity can be and strive for that.

If a freshman joins a house which
has presented the standard facade
and later finds inflated house bills
and initiation fees out of proportion
to what was promised in rush, uni-
formity in thought and action en-
forced by the caustic tongues of
“brothers,” sadistic and childish haz-
ing where none is acknowledged or
allowed, and lack of respect for the
rights and feelings of “brothers,”
that individual will probably fee!
duped and rejection will be the re-
action.

The facade of fraternities in con-
trast to the realities is hard to ra
tionalize and digest. These are some
of the reasons that fraternities might
feel anti-fraternity sentiment to be
overwhelming them. It is up to the
fraternities to change and change fast
and it is up to the University to pre-
sent a clear and pleasant alternative
to fraternity membership

' Through a Spyglass Darkly ...

Wheels Of Change

BY GREG RAETZ

Just about the first thing W&L stu-
dents do upon their return to Lexing-
ton is determine the changes which
have occurred in town and on camp-
us. This September being no excep-
tion, it seems likely that by now
everyone knows that the Robert E.
‘Lee Hotel is just as elegant and that
McCrum’s is just as fashionable as
they were when we left Lexington in
June.

However, there have been a few
changes which are notable. For those
who haven't visited Kenny's, and
for those who have and didn’t no-
tice, the do-it-yourself car wash is
no more. (What great timing! Now
that there is a real need for a car
wash with all of the dust created by
the excavations on Jefferson Street
it has been torn down.) The bake
shop with its “intellectaul” clientele
has moved around the corner to
Main Street. In its place stands the
Revolutionary “Bakery” with its sin-
gle arm chair, telephone, and ex-
pansive shelves complete with a
dozen books .

On campus the white columns and
Romulus Weatherman’s seersucker
sport coats remain, but there have
been changes underway here, too.

elementary school children played

during recess, is being converted
into more parking space.

On the fashion scene, the new look
seems to be imported from Egypt.
While the Afro haircut is still “in”,
there is an increasing trend among
students, and alas faculty, to let
their hair grow in such a manner that
they look like sphinxes.

Perhaps the biggest changes which
face returning students have been
promulgated by the W&L admini-
stration. Due to gym construction,
there would be a_ severe parking
shortage, so obviously something
had to be done to accommodate stu-
dents and faculty who drive cars to
class. In a lengthy publication sent
out over the summer the new park-
ing regulations were explained to
the students.

At a time when it seems obvious
that what we need is fewer cars and
not more, it has been decreed that
freshmen may have cars. These cars
must be kept in a distant lot, which
may help traffic congestion, but also
makes them easy targets for petty
theives.

Since parking space is at such a
premium, one would expect that
new parking areas would be con-
structed with much haste. The sad
fact is that after three months the
Jefferson Street lot is still under con-
struction and progressing slowly.
Finally, a $15 parking fee is being
charged to all students who wish to
use university facilities. There is no
value in this assessment because
many students live at a distance
from the campus and they must
drive cars to class. So why the fee?

With friends in the administration
who needs enemies?

Keydets Take Hand At Psychedelia

The normal atmosphere of con-
servative military tranquility

skirts of Lexington,
VMI’s squadron of tanks, employ-

ed, frequently, for military maneuv- .
ers, was discovered to have been be- |
smirched last week by new insignias. -

Slogans such as “Zero Spiro,” “Make
Love, Not War,” and a variety of

peace signs were applied in white ?

paint to the exteriors of five M-48A1
vehicles.

The discovery was made in the
bucolic setting that is White’s farm,
on the road to Goshen.

Hendrix, The Beatles & Us

BY ROBERT BAROODY

Today is 1970, and if you don’t be-
lieve it read the papers: Nixon is
president, Humphrey is running,
Hendrix is dead. Yes folks, Jimi
Hendrix pushed some smack into his
brains . . . blowing them away. And
we on the planet of earth can’t un-
derstand why he did it.

We even have the nerve to shake
our heads saying, “Man, Hendrix
was really messed up”; and then we
try to remember if this was the guy
who once said that you didn’t need
drugs to get out of your mind, that
music could replace acid. Hendrix
said it, and he was right. His music.
Read the papers: last week Spiro T.
agreed, rock==drugs and drugs=
rock. Kim, hide your Airplane re-
cords,

that |
generally marks activities at W&L’s 5
neighbor Virginia Military Institute, !
was apparently temporarily shattered ;
last week by a discovery on the out- °

For Hendrix heroin was only the
crash to a_ self-destructive power
trip that we asked for and that he
was willing to provide. Hendrix
played God for us.

He educated us; defined words
like psychedelic and _ electricity;
taught musicians how to use a guitar;
and he gave us our National An-
them. When Hendrix gave so much
we greedily asked for more, hardly
noticing the gradual metamorphosis
of a man becoming a corpse. As the
shows piled up it seemed that Hen-
drix was the thing they plugged into
the stage. He could see the change
and accepted it as a wild man’s fate.
At the age of twenty-three he said,
“Will I live tomorrow? Well, I don’t
know for sure, but I’m gonna live
today... .”

Finally, the feedback came in too
strong; Hendrix couldn’t give us
what he wanted to give, so at 24
years, sometimes looking closer to
80, he decided to die.

Meanwhile, at the Lyric Cinema,
four sometime gods tell us to “let
it be.” Long insulated from the
masses by their Saville Row record-
ing studio, the Beatles had options
that were unavailable to Hendrix. As
we know they chose corporate death;
and I don't mean this in a critical
sense. We can no more ridicule the
Beatles for their actions as we can
disavow our subculture which they
helped to create.

The film itself is no cinematic
wonder, We are simply offered a
parting glimpse of four men being
themselves at a recording session for
the “Let It Be” album. If McCart-
ney gets the most camera exposure,
it is George Harrison who is techni-
cally the most impressive. Now, with

 

_-

more time to spend on his own com-
positions, Harrison might well be-
come the first Beatle to make the
step from musical proficiency to
brilliance.

(I haven't seen Yellow Submarine
since it arrived here two years ago,
but I can easily remember this fea-
ture-length cartoon as the most ori-
ginal product of the genre, save
Mickey Mouse. If you like colored
fairy tales see it, otherwise you may
become bored.)

Thus ends an era. If you are
searching for a public statement full
of political and social significance,
then don’t go to these movies. Sim-
ply walk past the Lyric and look up
at the title. This, the farewell mess-
age of the Beatles, is curiously de-
livered in a tone that Bob Dylan ap-
proaches in “Self Portrait.” Like old
friends, the Beatles have always been
welcome at our mind's door, and if
they leave us looking like Santa
Claus and three elves what can we
say but happy new year.

Intramurals Revamped

BY STEVE GREEN

The intramural program is being
completely overhauled by Coach
Canfield this year. Coach Canfield
has taken the responsibility of com-
missioner in the intramural league.
Canfield stressed organization in his
discussion of the new program when
he stated that “it will be streamlined
and reformed but completely or-
ganized.

“We're not going to have a lot of
Mickey Mousing.” Fines will be
strictly enforced, and penalties won't
be light. Canfield, in this same re-
spect, made it clear that attendance
was extremely important.

Canfield also spoke of a new as-
pect of intramurals. Beginning this
year there will be indiivdual competi-
tion as well as team competition. For
the first time individuals may sign up
to play 2 man volleyabll, 3 on 3
basketball, badminton, and horse-
shoes. There will be awards in each
sport. Interested people may sign
up in the gym. There is an entrance
fee of 25 cents, Canfield said that
when the new facilities come, such
sports as water polo and squash will
be added to the program.

Another interesting facet of the
program is the set-up for team com-
petition. Beginning this year, there
will be three even leagues consisting
of Fraternity, Independent, and
Freshman teams. Up until the end of
the first semester, Freshmen will be

divided by dorm floors for competi-
tion. Each floor will be headed by a
dorm counselor. Canfield also ex-
pects the Independents and the Law
School to have two teams each.
Eventually the program will consist
of 3 leagues with six teams in each.

The scheduling of events has also
taken a turn. There will not be any
competition on Friday and none on
Mondays after big weekends. Also,
there will be a bulletin board in the
gym devoted entirely to Intramural
activities.

rhis year there also has been a
change in the Intramural board. The
board will consist of two students, a
faculty advisor, Coaches Canfield
and Corrigan. The responsibilities
will then be delegated from the
board to individual students. Officials
will be an organization controlled
by Canfield. Canfield stressed that
the officials will be extremely com-
petent for the games. There will be
an intramural office upstairs in the
gym and all equipment will be strict-
ly controlled for sole use in competi-
tion. Canfield said that football will
begin with six new balls. Equipment
will be the best Canfield can get.

The first part of the season will
consist of football, tennis, and cross
country. Competition begins Mon-
day.

The program has been set up to
have a promising future. “This year

BY ROB LARUE

As inevitable as death and taxes,
football has returned to preoccupy
once more sports pages and televi-
sion sets across the country. With the
grid season but one weekend old (or
to fudge a bit, six weeks including
the exhibitions), all eyes seem to be
turned to pro contests and collegiate
clashes.

Meanwhile, one of the most eycit-
ing pennant races is being waged in
the lower central column of most
local newspapers. Although — the
Orioles and Reds have clinched their
respective divisions, and Minnesota
has all but put away its second divi-
sional championship, the National
League East remains a toss-up be-
tween the Amazin’ Mets, the surpris-
ing Pittsburgh Pirates and those per-
ennial also Orans, the Chicago Cubs,
The Pirates, who are so pitcher-poor
that they could almost go on a wel-
fare program, have successfully been
able to forestall the New York nine
with a make-shift mound corps of
little-kKnowns and almost-forgottens,
thanks in large part to an awsome
assemblage of hitters.

Leo’s Cubs have been playing a
nip and tuck game of catch-up, only
to be set back just percentage poinis
out of first. Although the schedule
favors the Bruins, most of the money
is on the Mets and the Bucs. The
finish will probably be decided this
weekend by a four-game face-off be-
tween the Pirates and Gil Hodges’

 

wonders...

And speaking of baseball, Coach
Joe Lyles is making arrangements
for a brief fall season with neighbor
ing Virginia Military and possibly
Lynchburg or Virginia. Also, rumor
has it that the 1971 ball club will be
taking their talents to Texas at spring
vacation instead of Florida. Many

 

schools will have played the Grape- — 7

fruit circuit and returned norih by
the time W&L gets out of cxams,
April 10.

Heard here and there ... a lol of
money changed hands this weekend
in a rash of football upsets. Among
the most notable were Tulane over
Georgia, Texas A&M over LSU, that
Southern Cal.—Nebraska tie, and,
among the pros, the Bengals victory
over Oakland and Detroit's pastirg
of the Packers . . . Kudos te sopho-
more safety Marshall Washburn for
a sensational performance against
Emory and Henry.

. Saturday marked the first
Washington and Lee football game

in quite a while to lack a Kumpuris &

in the lineup. Drew K., the younger

half of that Little Rock wrestling ~~

crew, was felled earlier this month
by a knee injury and is out for the
season, bad luck for a competitor
like Drew... but defensive coach
Boyd Williams cannot complain
about his starting four linebackers,
Frank Evans, Ken Carter, and a pair
of coming sophomores, George Har-
ris and Tim Haley.

Booters Face Dickinson

BY PETER JONES

Washington and Lee looks for a
big finish this year as coach Lyles
returns plenty of experience, talent,
and youth from a 7-2-2 club of iast
year,

With two years of greuling condi-
tioning and practice behind them the
varsity has built up a polished at-
tack and defense behind the veteran
senior captains, Mark Sayres and
Carl Hyatt and sophomore sensa-
tions Meade Kampfmeuiler and
Hank Slauson. They lead the team
into its first Va. inter-Soccer Associa-
tion game this Friday at Dickenson.

Last year, vitually the same team
carried itself to the NCAA regionals
at Springfield, Mass. only to be halt-
ed in the first round. Coach Lyles un-
topped in flamboyancy sees tremen-
dous potential in his young team
laden with an abundance of talented
sophomores and freshmen. The next
few years could prove to be the best
soccer Washington and Lee has seen
in a while.

rhe freshman team, as yet without
a coach, has constantly scrimmaged
the varsity the past week and will
open its season next week. Five of
the twelve game varsity schedule
games are home, on the soccer field
that doubles as a parking lot during
football games.

The tough games seem to be the

On Murphing, Hunting, Cruising, and Things —

There’s a new sport on campus this year.
not officially labelled, it’s
“dodging” or “Murphing.” You play it with

Though called
your car, and the object is to park your un-
registered vehicle within five minutes of your
class. It’s a great spectator sport, especially
when someone is caught: “Uh, Murph, | was
just dropping these guys off...” or “I was
going to pick up some materials .. .” To say
the least, few people have succeeded at the
sport.

Someone told me of a freshman who had
all his courses on MWF, except P.L. which
he has on TT, Let’s hear it for P.1é.

For all you hunters, here are the seasons

This summer, I was fortunate enough to
visit the “Incredible,” which is the race com-
mittee boat for the America Cup Races. It is
truly incredible: 70 feet long, draws 4 feet
and has a top speed of 36 knots. The control
room Was just amazing—two radars, automa-
tic pilot, omni and a small navigational/trou-
ble-shooting computer, Totally air condition-
ed, a galley with a radar oven ete, ete. It was
built by Hatteras and was just sold for a half
million dollars. Oh well.

Archie Manning had 200 total yards and
was 15 for 19 on Saturday. Funny thing is that
he only played the first half. Watch Ole Miss!

Golfers will have to go to the Homestead
for their pleasure this fall, The Lexington
course won't be finished until spring.

Coach Canfield has done an amazing job at
straightening out the Intramural Program.
Kventually he hopes to have billiards, water
polo, and many more, See the story on page 4.

Another aspect to the vehicle registration
problem is the new abundance of cyclists.
You find the most amazing people on bikes.

Right, Dean Atwood?

   

During the Emory and Henry game, the General defense mustered a goal line stand late in the third quarter.
However the Washington and Lee squad was not able to put enough points on the board as they lost 27-14.

BY PALMER TRICE
AND ERIC WHITE

The Generals opened the 1970
football season on a dismal note,
dropping a 27-14 decision to a big,
tough Emory and Henry squad. The
younger, smaller Blue and White
were unable to halt the consistent
ground game of the Wasps.

Using their size to good advant-
age, the Wasps gained over 300 yards
on the ground alone. The Generals
defense had trouble containing the
quarterback option, which the Emory
and Henry offense used to score two
TD's. Wayne Neese, the highly-
touted Little All-American bulldozed
for 200 yards, and 3 TD's, on 42
carries.

Emory and Henry opened the scor-
ing in the first period, Neese going
around left end from 4 yards out.
Another Wasp march was stopped
on an interception by sophomore
linebacker George Harris. The theft
was made inside the W&L 10, just
as the gun sounded to end the first
quarter.

Early in the second quarter, Wasp
placekicker Wilson kicked a 45 yard
field goal, making the score 10-0,
With about two minutes left in the
first half, Tommy Van Amburgh
stepped back and hurled a 48 yard
pass to wide receiver Steve Mahaffey.
Moments later, Quarterback Van
Amburgh left the pocket and scurried
15 yards to the end zone. The clock
showed 1:36 left in the half. The
Generals looked as if they were back
in the ballgame.

The Blue and White defense
toughened in the third period. How-
ever, the offense failed to materialize.
Early in the final quarter, the Wasp
All-American again scored on an op-
tion, this time from two yards out,
Ihe Generals stormed back on a
69 yard pass, Van Amburgh to Ma-
haffey, this time for six points, With
8:52 remaining in the game, the
score was EAH 17—WA&L 14,

The Wasp offense, however, took
the kickoff and refused to be stopped.
Neese scored his third TD with 4:20
left in the game. With 11 seconds
left, Wilson added a 37 yard field
goal to his credit.

The 27-14 score does not reflect
the outstanding performance handed
in by the Washington and Lee de-
fense. Emory and Henry consistently
came up with the big play on third
down situations, converting success-
fully on 13 such plays. Due in part
to the Wasp defense, and in part to

W&L Drops Tough Opener

the lack of a consistent W&L of-
fense, Emory and Henry ran off
twice as many offensive plays as the
Generals. Three fumbles and three
interceptions proved very costly to
the chances of a General victory.
Washington and Lee will be a
decided underdog Saturday after-
noon when they face the visiting
Towson State College at Wilson
Field. Kickoff will be at 2:00 p.m.
The Generals must bolster their
offense in order that they compete
with the Tigers, who were practically
untested in demolishing Gallaudet,
29-0, in their opener last Saturday.

WAL received a stalwart perfor-
mance from their defense in last
week's contest against the Wasps.
This level of performance must be
maintained against Towson. Particu-
lar standouts last week were Safety
Marshall Washburn, who intercept-
ed a pass and made 16 unassisted
tackles, and linebacker Frank Evans,
who made 16 individual tackles and
helped in 11 others. The aerial de-
fense did a fine job, giving up but 70
yards, and intercepting 2 passes.
But offensively, the Generals showed

 

little other than the pass-catching of
end Steve Mahaffey. The Columbus,
Ohio senior snagged four for 147
yards, including two Van Amburgh
bombs. A ground game must be
found to go with the quick striking
aerial combination. The Generals
gained only 71 yards on the ground
against Emory and Henry.

WAL will be facing many of the
same Towson personnel who dropp
ed a narrow 14-13 decision to our
gridmen last year. Quarterback Al
Dodds and running back Dennis
Champney, who gained most of the
yardage last time out, are joined by
a tough senior fullback, Randy
Canal, the workhouse against Gal-
laudet.

WAL scout Syd Walden’s report
was terse: “Towson is better than
Emory and Henry.” That could eas-
ily mean bad news for the Generals,

THE RING-TUM PHI

Development Office

In Lee-Jackson Home

Ihe historic Lee-Jackson House
on the campus is the new temporary
home for the university's develop-
ment office.

The house was occupied until this
summer by Mr, and Mrs. Charles P.
Light. Mr. Light, a professor of law,
is the former dean of the School of
Law.

The Lee-Jackson House will again
be occupied by a university dean in
the near future, according to univer-
sity officials. At that time, other
space will become available for the
development office.

Traditionally, deans or senior fac-
ulty members and their families live
in the stately, ante-bellum houses on
Washington and Lee’s front campus.

The development office simply out-
grew its old quarters, which consist-
ed of three small rooms, a vault and
a closet on the ground floor of Wash-
ington Hall, the main adminmstra-
tion building. The development staff
of seven, plus extensive records and
a great deal of machinery had been
previously accommodated in that
small space as well.

The Lee-Jackson House was Gen.
Robert E. Lee’s residence in Lexing-
ton until a house was specially built
for him and Mrs. Lee, next door on
the Washington College campus.

Before Lee was elected president
of Washington College, Thormas
“Stonewall” Jackson had lived in
the house for a time. Jackson, a pro-
fessor of engineering at neighboring
Virginia Military Institute, married
Margaret Junkin, whose father was
president of Washington College

Troubadours To Hold Auditions,
Open Season With “Billy Budd”

BY LARRY PATTERSON

The Troubadours of Washington
and Lee can look forward to a “very
challenging season, according to Mrs.
O. K. Barnes, the theater's director
for 1970-71. The productions offer-
ed this winter and spring will range
from an ancient Greek drama to a
modern Off-Broadway play.

The season will open on Novem-
ber 4 with “Billy Budd,” an adapta-
tion of Herman Melville's sea clas-
sic. The play will boast a cast of
thirty, providing ample opportunity
for all interested to try out for a
role.

Auditions for this production will
be held at the Troubadour Theater
on both Thursday and Friday be-
tween 4:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., ac-
cording to Dave Christovitch, the
seasonal stage manager.

The group's second production
will be Tom Stoppard’s 1968 Off-
Broadway success, “Rosenkrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead.” The play,
winner of the New York Drama Cri-
tic’s Award, is scheduled to open
February 10.

year-old comedy will appear May
19,

According to Mrs. Barnes, W&L
drama instructor, each of the plays
will run on four consecutive even-
ings with curtain time at 8:30 p.m.

Highly Important Notice

Freshmen are asked to break rush
dates either at fraternity tables or
by phone each Wednesday, between
5 and 8 p.m., in order to avoid rush
date mix-ups. Rushees from Preston
and Nelson dorms, and those living
in the Lexington community, will
be picked up in the reading room of
the old freshman dorm.

In addition, a dorm rush coin.
ciding with fraternity table hours in
the quad will be held on the after-
noon of each Rush Date.

ing considered. These programs
would be of a continuing nature.

Weekend dialogues and guest
speakers are among other projected
activities. The first weekend dialo-
gue is to be on the topic of suicide.
In the dialogues, a university profes-
sor or other qualified person will
lead non-structured sessions on a
topic of his choosing.

Free University is hoping to re-
new the 11 a.m. Sunday coffee speak-
ers in the Student Union building
and use the time for experimental
worship forms. The Student Center
and the Religion Department have
funds for this purpose.

Money and student and faculty in-
terest are short at this time for Free
University activities. Letters have
been sent out to faculty members,
requesting suggestions and asking
for volunteers to lead courses or one-
night dialogues. Students who are in-
terested in further information about

leading a course or dialogue should
contact Steve Haughney.

According to Steve, “The main
thrust of the Free University will be
derived from student response. If
the students do not respond, Free
University has not failed—the stu-
dents have failed.”

Cast For “Billy Budd”
Announced This Week
By Troubadour T heater

BY JED YONGE

“Theater.” a word whose defini-
tion lies on a spectrum extending
from the libertine land of Bourbon
Street, its Super Skin and monoton-
ous monologue “48 triple E, come
and see”, to the ultra-real world of
social injustice portrayed most em-
phatically by the actors of the “gue-
rrila theater”; from the melodrama
of the Lux Liquid and other “soaps”
(for which the authors should have
their mouths washed out with their
own product for creating such poor
dialogue) to the Shakespearean
theater of Stratford, Connecticut. (1
must apologize to all you drama
buffs for the dramatic simplification
of the spectrum.)

Somewhere on the above spectrum
lies the adaption of Melville’s “Billy
Budd.” With the exception of an
ironic wrench (“twist” can not con-
vey the amount of irony in the play),
the play is a vehicle to express the
tenor of life’s lifeless battle between
good and evil. It is the very tripe
theme of battle that dictates good
casting, workable set construction
and a clear portrayal in a “do or die”
manner,

Among other firsts—one being
that director Mrs. Ellen Barnes 1s
Washington and Lee’s unique (used
here in the mathematical sense), non-
masculine (*non-masculine” because
1 feel that “feminine” has no con-
notative meaning on this campus)
professor—is the use of the raked
stage. This type of design is meant
to add to the realism of the play
Curiously, however, the attempt to
effect a certain realism will be offset
by the fact that the audience will be
allowed to view the players on and
off the set. The idea being that you,
the audience, are to realize that you
are in a theater and not spying upon
the drama occurring on a British fri

gate

Moger Films Documentary Interview

BY SKIP PAUKERT

The Colonnade served as the back-
drop last Tuesday as film cameras
focused on Dr. Allen Moger of the
History faculty. With the heightened
interest in Constitutional revision in
Virginia, WTAR-TV in Norfolk had
asked Mr. Moger to appear in a one-
hour documentary, which will trace
the development of the state con-
stitution from its colonial inception
up to the newly proposed changes
offered by the present Commission
on Revision

Dr. Moger's interview concerned
the Constitution's growth during the
years immediately following the
Civil War, a period when Virginia
government was embodied in a bitter
controversy over the adjustment of
the state debt. He also discussed the
strong movement for constitutional
revision which occurred just after
the turn of the century. Moger’s
own authoritative work, From Bour-
banism to Byrd, explores many such
governmental dilemmas which arose
during the strenuous Reconstruction

era in Virginia.
Also interviewed in the broadcast
will be two ardent advocates of the

currently proposed constitutional
changes, former Governor Miles

Godwin and Governor A, Linwood
Holton. The major provision of the
proposals, which face a general re-
ferendum in November, is a plan
that would authorize bonds for capi-
tal improvements. The impetus of the
new bond procedure would likely re-
sult in greater support for public
education and hospitals.

Although he favors the revisions,
Dr. Moger said of the bond provi
sion, “It's one of the most ambigu-

ous things I've ever read—worse
than an insurance policy.” He prais-
ed former Governor Godwin for his
consistent advocacy of the changes,
and termed as “brilliant” the lecture
given at Washington and Lee by
Godwin in 1968 on the subject of the
revisions.

The documentary is scheduled for
broadcast in Norfolk in early Octo-
ber and in other Virginia cities, in-
cluding Roanoke, later in the month.
The script was written by James
E. Mays, news director for WTAR,
and filmed by Tim Hickman, for-
merly of Lexington and now camera-
man for the Norfolk station,

Fancy Dress Is Off,
EC Calls for Forum

BY RITA ENNIS
Another tradition bites the dust.
There will be no Fancy Dress Ball
this year. Skip Nottberg. President
of Dance Board, announced at the
Executive Committee meeting Mon-
day night that because of a greatly
reduced budget and past history of
student disinterest, Fancy Dress has

been cancelled for this year.

 

See Editorial Comment, Page 2

 

In other EC action, the Student
Body “Open Forum” was scheduled
for tonight at 7:00 p.m. in the Cock-
pit. Student Body President Fran
Lawrence commented that he “would
like to make the ‘Open Forums’
monthly events if student interest
warrants it.”

President Lawrence also slated
another set of Freshman EC “Dorm
Conversations” for tomorrow night
The purpose of these conversations
is to discuss student government and
the honor system.

Nottberg presented an extensive
report to EC concerning Dance
Board activities and plans. Concerts
are scheduled for Oct. 9 with the
New York Rock Ensemble and
Sweetwater and Nov. 13 with Char-
lie Byrd. A concert in late February

featuring James Taylor is being
planned. Notiberg said that door
sales from these three concerts
would determine other entertain-

ment. Due to a sharp decrease in
Dance Plan purchases, the Dance
Board is operating on a budget of
about $17,000

The EC heard a report from chair
man Dan Silberberg concerning pro
gress towards the 1972 Mock Con
vention. In addition, the Committee
discussed the Lexington license tags
which students are required to pur
chase, but no official

W @L Selects Law Student

To Serve as Dean’s Aide

The appointment of Larry D.
Jones, a Washington and Lee law
student, as an assistant in the dean of
students’ office has been announced
by Dean of Students Lewis G. John.

Jones, 24, will work with Associ-
ate Dean William McC. Schildt, who
is coordinator of the freshman year.
He is a graduate of Virginia State
College, where he was president of
the Pan Hellenic Council and work-
ed with underclassmen as a dorm
counselor and as an orientation “big
brother.” He began his law studies at
Washington and Lee a year ago and
will continue to take law courses
while occupying his new post

“Mr. Jones’ specific responsibili
ties have not yet been defined,” Dean
Schildt said, “but it was felt that it
would be helpful to have someone
assisting in the special responsibili

ties for programs relating to the
freshman year.”
Jones selected Washington and

Lee Law School because of its high

rating and its “sense of together
ness,” the fact that “no one gets
lost.”

He has enjoyed his first year at

WAL, finding the law school atmos
phere “interesting.” Eventually he
hopes to enter a firm and perhaps
later practice privately

Jones views his
job in the general rather
specific. He hopes to get to know
freshman, especially blacks, and aid
in alleviating disillusionment, help
ing to get oriented to Lexington and
to WAI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Wednesday, September 30, 1970

The Dance (On A Tightrope) Board

As we perused dusty past issues of this
newspaper, we noted with considerable inter-
est the proliferation of editorials on the in-
stitution which provides the entertainment
for men of this University—the Dance Board.

In the distant past, the Dance Board made
excellent material for an editorial, The editor
would simply go to a concert the weekend be-
fore and write a brief editorial complimenting
the Dance Board for producing the entertain-
ment, the performers for providing the en-
tertainment and the students for being enter-
tained. Those carefree years are, alas, gone.

Recent years have seen editors propose
all sorts of intricate plans for revamping the
Dance Board in order that the body might
more effectively fight the rising cost of enter-
tainment.

And now we find ourselves joining the
ranks of others immediately preceeding us.
Or do we? Our intent is not so much a pre-
sentation of innovative schemes for Dance
soard president Skip Nottberg to reject or
adopt as it is a presentation of some unpleas-
ant facts and one rather unavoidable conclu-
sion.

The following are the unpleasant facts
which president Nottberg faces:

(1) Last year’s president, Dean Kumpuris,
left a $6,000 deficit, which had to be taken
out of the reserve fund. This left Nottberg
$3,700—a rather unhealthy cushion if the
Dance Board finds itself in debt this year as
well.

(2) Last year, 770 dance plans were sold

-then the least number of dance plans ever
sold. Nottberg and his Board broke the record
this year with sales of only 440 plans and re-
venue totalling an unimpressive $17,500. An
average budget for the Dance Board should

be in the range of $30,000 to $40,000.

(3) Nottherg promised a slate of six dance
weekends; and he intends to fulfill that pro-
mise if the Dance Board has the money.
Three of the weekends are already contracted :
October 9 features Sweetwater and the New
York Rock Ensmble for a total of $6,400; No-
vember 13 is set for Charlie Byrd at $1,750;
and a tentative date in either late February
or the first week in March is planned for
James Taylor to a tune of $7,500. Cost of the
contracted weekends is $15,650. Well, not ex-
actly.

(4) It costs the Dance Board $500 each
time entertainment is planned for Doremus.
Two years ago the University charged $300
for arranging the chairs on the gym floor,
but inexplicably the price has increased, One
presumes this increase is due to inflation.
Since it cost the Dance Board $120 to use the
facilities at VMI two years ago, Nottberg is
attempting to save some money by investigat-
ing the possibility of renting the VMI gym
for the first concert. Even if he does get a re-
duced rate from our neighbors, the majority
of the concerts will have to appear in Doremus
because VMI will not rent their gym during
basketball season. So the cost of the physical
plant for these three contracted concerts is at
best $1,120, which gives a grand total of
$16,770 which will be spent on the contracted

entertainment. And, as the smoke from the
adding machine clears, we find president Nott-
berg and his band of unhappy men with less
than $1,000 to put on three other concerts.

As Nottberg so aptly put it in Monday
night’s Executive Committee meeting, “one-
third of the student body bought dance plans.

.., and they're risking their money for the
entertainment. Whereas, the other two-thirds
of the student body is waiting to see what en-
tertainment is coming.” Nottberg hopes that
the attractions planned will be able to attract
enough people who do not have dance plans
so that the Dance Board will be able to raise
enough money from the sale of $10 a couple
tickets to finance the other three weekends.

Note that he “hopes.” Also note that we
are skeptical about the quality of entertain-
ment that the Dance Board would be able to
provide for the rest of the year with the re-
venue from these door sales. As the situation
is now, Nottberg is gambling by contracting
the entertainment while the students window
shop.

Is this any way to run a Dance Board?
The president of the Dance Board needs to
have some reasonable estimate of what his
budget will be for the coming year before he
can contract the groups which the students
want. The only way he can do his job ade-
quately is to insure him some definite income
for the Dance Board to contract with groups
before the school year begins. And by wit-
nessing the record decrease in dance plan
sales, it appears that not very many students
voluntarily spend $40 on entertainment which
they aren't certain of ever witnessing.

So we actually come to two alternatives,
really. Abolish the Dance Board and establish
an Album Board whereby those who still
thirst for entertainment and excitement can
purchase records at a discount. Or establish a
student entertainment fee whereby each stu-
dent would pay $25 to $30 for a guaranteed
season of top entertainment. We recommend
the latter.

This proposal is nothing new ; neither are
the objections to it. Various individuals have
argued and will argue that the requirement of
an entertainment fee is ludicrous because the
students are being pressed enough for money
as it is and because there are some students
who might not want to attend all of the con-
certs that this proposed revenue would pro-
vide. Yes, the students are required to pay a
small fee for Contact and class dues for cock-
tail parties; surprisingly enough they pay
the fees and a large majority of them attend.
And by the way, would these functions be
even able to rise to a level of mediocrity if
students didn’t have to support them?

We ask the EC to press for the institution
of an entertainment fee which would provide
the Dance Board with a workable yearly bud-
get. If this proposal is rejected and the Dance
Board is left to remain in limbo on a financial
tightrope, then we will have to wish Skip
Nottberg all the luck in the world and urge
that the EC consider an amendment to the
constitution requiring a candidate for the
Dance Board presidency have a year’s experi-
ence in Las Vegas.

The Exchange Program: On The Other Side

Sweet Briar’s Innovation In Education

BY LAWRENCE McCONNELL
AND
MACK WOODWARD

(Editor's Note: Coeducation ap-
pears to be a major issue now fac-
ing small private colleges through-
out the country. Washington and
Lee now finds itself the oldest men’s
university in the United States since
the advent of Princeton University’s
merger with the opposite sex. Yet
even W&L is experimenting with
coeducation as are seven other
schools through an exchange pro-
gram inaugurated this year.

In order to better assess the fu-
ture of W&L and other colleges in
the surrounding area, The Ring-tum
Phi editorial board plans a series of
four interviews with college officials
from Sweet Briar, Hollins, Mary
Baldwin, and Rando!ph-Macon to
ascertain their evaluation of the fu-
ture of theiv colleges with respect to

q

This week's interview was conduct.
ed last Thursday with the president
of Sweet Briar College, Mrs. Anne
Pannell. Mrs. Pannell has served the
college as president for 21 years and
had a vast background in education
before she became the college's
president.

The Ring-tum Phi appreciates
Mrs, Pannell’s graciousness in al-
lowing us to present this taped, tran-
scribed interview.

Her views on coeducation and the
future of Sweet Briar College are be-
low. We hope you, the reader, find
them as enlightening as we did.)

Ring-tum Phi: Why did Sweei
Briar decide to participate in the
exchange program and what does
the college hope to benefit from the
program?

Mrs. Anne Pannell: E xperimenta-
tion and innovation, We've been pio-
neers in the Junior Year Abroad
Program since the 1930's. We've had
exchange programs with the Uni-
versity of St. Andrew's and the Uni-
versity of Paris, so we are great be-
lievers in the year or semester of
exchange. We've had exchange pro-
grams with my alma mater, Barnard
College in New York We've had
girls going on the Washington Se-
mester, and the U.N, Semester and
we've always felt that for the highly
trained, highly motivated girl that
these are special experiences that
might have value

We saw this simply as another ex
periment in exchange, which we be
lieve in. The educational process can
be enriched by many experiences

R+ Phi: Do you think that your
being a women's college has affected
your admissions policy?

Pannell: Oh, well, we hope to re
main a women's college. My special
conviction is that there is and will
continue to be a place for the wo-
mens college. Coeducation is the
commonest thing in America: you
can get ii On every street corner and
Im not a believer in the values of
conformity. | think
greai value. There will continue to

     

diversity is of

be people who want to come to the
uni-sex college and they ought to
have an opportunity and place to
come,

R-t Phi: Do you think that this is
one of the assets of Sweet Briar?

Pannell; Oh, yes, I believe very
definitely in a small, residential, one
sex college that tries to be extremely
good and believes very deeply in
what it is doing—and why it is do-
ing it.

R-t Phi: How many men are you
expecting?

Pannell: Oh, I don't think we're
going to have but two,

R-t Phi: There are more than two
at Hollins College, is there any rea-
son why there are so few at Sweet
Briar?

Pannell: Well, they had to pass
their respective deans, you know.
We said we wouldn't take anybody
unless they had a respectable aca-
demic reason for coming. We're not
anxious to just have men as men
with nothing else to recommend
them. We have no prejudice, gen-
tlemen, against men, but we are a
college and we want people to come
here, you know, if they wanted to
study advanced French literature.
or ecology, or ornithology, or art
history. We have certain fields of
economics and liberal arts in which
we feel we do unusual work. If they
had had some legitimate goal in
mind we'd have been happy to re-
ceive them.

R-t Phi: We were wondering about
the problem facing most small col-
leges, that is, money... .

Pannell: Well, this is the greatest
problem facing us in education to-
day, and that is the effect of infla-
tion. | mean I think this affects the
whole future of private education.
Can we afford to finance it in the
future?

R-t Phi: Do you think that in con-
sidering the cost of private educa-
tion, co-education would be benefi-
cial to you?

Pannell: No, to us it would be a
terribly costly thing. We've had stu-
dies made and we estimate that it
would cost us $15 million to buy
the masculine brains to equal the
caliber of girls we have in college.

$15 million to set up the kind of
scholarship program that would
bring the caliber of young man in
here that we want. And think of the
number of restrooms we'd have to
put in. We'd have to change our

dormitories, put in more playing
fields, more athletic coaches, all
those kind of things.

R-t Phi: What are your plans for
development?

Pannell: Oh, well, development.
Yes, we'd like to be a college; we're
a college of about 700—700 is our
residential capacity, and we give a
full scholarship to any girl from this
county. So we always have 15 to 40
day students on scholarship and we
would like to be a college of a thou-
sand to 2000. We think that’s the
ideal size—anything after that begins
to be impersonal. We'd like, again,
to use our campus and these enorm-
ous resources for ecological studies.

We do have so much land that
we feel guilty—socially; we feel we
want to fulfill our social respon-
sibilities to use our magnificient set-
ting for as much social good as we
can.

We are in the midst of a cam-
paign to raise funds to invest in peo-
ple in more scholarship resources
and faculty and research.

Coeducation often comes up, |
mean it's not something we put un-
der the carpet or treat lightly. We
have no prejudice against men, and
about fifty percent or better of our
faculty are men. But we're the only
college in the South that has women
administrators. We go the ultimate
of believing that women can parti-
cipate in their own education and ad-
minister their own education.

R-t Phi: Who would have the final
decision in determining whether
Sweet Briar would go co-ed?

Pannell: Oh, the Board of Direc-
tors.

R-t Phi: If the Board of Directors
said that you were to go co-ed as
soon as possible, would it require
that $15 million—and new buildings?

Pannell: li would take new dormi-
tories, a new gymnasium, I don't
know what else.

R-t Phi: Do you see coeducation
as the coming thing for small col-
leges?

Pannell: Well, it already is—oh,
for small colleges. | don’t think, you
see, I don't really think that there's
any type. I don’t think that you can
really prove that in any way, shape,
or form that one type of education
iS superior to another, I think the
problems of the small college are
financial, and I don't think coeduca-
tion is going to help to solve them.
The only survival pattern is quality,

Letters To The Editor...

Kappa Sigma Alumni

See Faults In System

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

The recent demise of Mu Chap-
ter of Kappa Sigma should be a
cause for concern for the admini-
stration and student body of Wash-
ington and Lee. It is such a cause
for many of us who were members
of that chapter in the past.

First of all, it is normal for men,
in all walks of life, to organize them-
selves into groups of mutual interests
and benefits. Thus, those who delight
in the destruction of the fraternity
system should consider that other
forms of such associations, such as
eating clubs, will very probably arise
to replace fraternities. Of course,
these other social organizations will

only be able to grow and function if
the freedom of the university com-
munity is not totally destroyed,

Second, the appeal to past mem-
bers of Mu Chapter to help save the
dying house was made at a point be-
yond which such help could have
been effective. Many, including in-
terested and responsible members of
the faculty, members and officers of
the chapter, and, in large part, the
administration had a_ responsibility
to inform us at a time when the
chapter could have been saved.

Of course, some will seize on an
excuse that the chapter was a part
of a national fraternity, which
should be accountable. But anyone
who has been at W&L knows that
its fraternities are basically local!
houses, more a part of the campus

and more responsible to the unti-
versity than to their nationals,

it is very easy to destroy by fail-
ing to act in time. And that is what
occurred, We who were part of Mu
Chapter at one time are very sad-
dened and dismayed that no one
felt obligated to let us know in time,
because we would have liked to help
while such aid might have worked.

Those who are part of the still
functioning fraternity chapters at
W&L can take warning from Mu
Chapter’s sad end. They should know
that the health of a chapter at any
one period is not a guarantee of its
continued health, particularly its fi-
nancial viability, at any future time.

The lesson is that like the survival!
of any free institution, the continu-

A Look At The Old Coach

BY PALMER TRICE

“Alright you guys, push it! Push
‘! Get to the next flag, you get cx-
tra points! Let’s move it”. This awe-
inspiring roar greeted freshmen on
their second or third day on campus,
as physical education placement
tests were given by Coach Norman
F. Lord. The tests were simple to
comprehend, but, to say the least,
grizzly to execute. After a summer
of fun and frolic, few of us were
prepared to run for 12 minutes. The
objective set by this commanding
stranger was six laps, or a mile and
a half. The run was started and the
puffing began.

Lightning Valley Is Here

BY ROBERT BAROODY

If you walk past the Dutch Inn
you might notice a new sign pro-
claiming the existence of the
“Lightning Valley Food Store”,
which is probably the most enlight-
ened enterprise ever to be begun in
Lexington.

An idea of student Matt Cliett,
the health food store opened for
business early this week and will be
open weekdays from about 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m. Soon to be featured at the
LVFS will be a genuine stone mill,
which will allow the customer to se-
lect the exact texture of his flour.

The following interview was with
Roger Cook and Richard Dillon,
two graduates of W&L who run the
store with Cliett:

However, we were not to be left
alone in our torture. Every minute
on the minute, a booming voice sang
out the time remaining. As time be-
gan to grow short the voice gave
not only the time, but psychological
lifts also. We were urged to pick up
our feet and to get to the next flag,
which was located 110 yards away.
“Push it, push it, push it!” Follow-
ing the running, a swimming test
was given. After this we were either
placed into or chose a P.E, class,
Sul the most memorable part of the
day was the running test.

The following week, I attended
my first phys. ed. class at Washing-

 

&
to do is to open up the possibility
of a much larger menu in this town.
You know, people in this town eat
the same thing every day. It’s boring
food!

Roger Cook: And there’s a lot of
joy in experimenting. Most people
I've met are afraid to try different
things. When they walk into a res-
taurant they're afraid to look at the
menu: they look very quickly to see
if the place has something they
know that they will like.

Dillon: When some people hear
something that’s different they im-
mediately become skeptics. Roger
and I aren't skeptics, and we're
willing to open up our taste buds to
see the difference.

R-t Phi: Isn't eating health foods
considered a fad?

Dillon: Western Civilization may
be a fad.

ton and Lee. We met under a tree in
front of Doremus Gymnasium. First,
our instructor introduced himself.
“The name is Lord, L-O-R-D. You
can call me Lord, Coach Lord, or
—!Some incomprehensible foreign
phrase which means “Super Chief.”
We were all turned toward Dore-
mus, in its poor state, that is, with
few lockers or showers and no hot
water, “You are a part of history,”
we were told. Fifty years ago this
gym was being built. There weren't
any showers or lockers then either.
He then explained our objectives.
“When you run, you burn oxygen.”
Also, despite the fact that some peo-
ple would not want him to say this,
“it's good for you to sweat!” This
was followed by an interesting and
biologically precise explanation of
why it is good to perspire. In order
to aid his keeping track of us, he
told us “put your name on your
shirt nipple high, in block letters,”

For the first time in my life, I
was told to buy a text book for phy-
sical education; The New Aerobics
—that’s ae ro bics not ae ro’ bics.
Coach Lord, whose name by unani-
mous consent, fits him perfectly, ex-
plained that the program had first
been tried “on a group of studs,”
After it worked on them, they tried
it on all kinds of people: old peo-
ple, out of shape people, sick and
crippled people. It worked for all of
them. It will work for us, despite
the fact that the class meets but two
days a week. “I only have your
bodies twice a week. I wish I had
your bodies for more time. “The
USAF has adopted this exercise pro-
gram, as it was found in “Dr. Coop-
er’s eagerly awaited 2nd book for
the entire family.”

Rugby Club Opens New Fall Schedule

BY STEVE GREENE

The Washington and Lee rugby
team features plenty of experience
as they face their upcoming fall
schedule. Tommy Baker, president
of the rugby club, expressed extreme
optimism as the rugby team for the
first time plays a fall schedule. In
the past they have only competed in
the spring.

Baker stated that he has 35 players
out and termed that very good. He
added “' to % of them are experi-
enced, A lot of the players are Law

students who competed in undergra-
duate school.”

Last year in the spring season the
team compiled a 4-3-1 record and
Baker thinks they can better that.
This year, with the surplus of play-
ers, there will be an A and B team.
The B team will play its games
immediately before the A game.

This year’s captain of the rugby
team is Allen GaNun. All games
start at 2:00 on the upper field next
to the baseball field. One other note
is that beer parties will be after

every game for the players.

ate his abilities. Aged 51, he has
been at W&L for 24 years. He gra-
duated from the University of Dela
ware and got his Masters at Spring-
field College. Before coming to Lex-
ington, the taught and coached at his
alma mater, and toured as a visiting
professor at Springfield for a year.
Now he is a Lt. Col. in the Army
Reserve and a professor of Physical
Education at W&L. He fought in
World War II and later in Korea.
In 1946, he served as a civilian ath-
letic consultant to the Dept. of the
Army. He helped put out the US.
Army manual.

Coach Lord definitely practices
what he preaches. His physical fit-
ness is astounding, and his attitude
toward a usually dull course is re-
freshing.” Handball is ice cream, he
says, “meaning that football and the
like are the meat and potatoes, and
the lesser sports are dessert... .

That's L-O-R-D ! !

Penn State’s Demise

 

vaunted Big Blue was trampled by
a herd of Buffaloes—Colorado var-
iety. The loss was the first for Penn
State in thirty-one ball games, break-
ing a twenty-three game winning
streak that dated back to a 17-17
Gator Bowl tie with Florida State
in 1967.

Saturday's statistics are but his-
tory now, but as State’s head coach
Joe Paterno summed it up in the
newspapers, “We were outcoached,
outplayed, outhit, and outscored.”

But, upon reflection, Penn State
need not feel angry at itself for
blowing the game. Indeed, Colorado,
by its performance, has to be rec-
koned with as one of the nation’s
strongest clubs. The Golden Buffs’
defense formed an almost inpene-
trable barrier against an offense
which had rolled up fifty-five points
against Navy a week earlier, And

 

the offense ignited for forty-one
points, the most scored on the Nit-
tany Lions’ defense in a long, long,
time,

Pass after pass and play after
play, Colorado could do no wrong.
Although perhaps Saturday was just
a bad day for Penn State, I feel that
Colorado could take the Blue seven
times out of ten tries with maybe
one tie thrown in,

Colorado’s strength may yet bring
ringing cheers of enthusiasm and a
possible Big Eight championship to
Folsom Field in Boulder. Anyway,
that Colorado-Nebraska face-off sev-
eral weeks from now should be a
real ding-dong battle, in a confer-
ence once referred to as “Oklahoma
and the Seven Dwarfs.”

So no wthat number four-ranked
Penn State no longer owns the long-
est winning streak, who does? Ob-
noxious Texans really have some-
thing to crow about besides that
silly tower with the orange lights.

The Longhorns of the University
of Texas, after beating hapless Texas
Tech, 35-13, have gone unbeaten
through twenty-two consecutive

 

The General Soccer Team opened its season with a heartbreaking 1-0
defeat to northeastern power, Dickinson College, at Carlisle, Pennsyl-
vania. The Dickinson team, which is well into its season, had to hussle
to whip the Blue and White. The Generals play host to the Lynchburg
College Hornets at home on Wednesday.

The injury hex that has struck
WA&L’s captains for the past four
years has done it again this year.
First, it was co-captain and lineback-

Little Rock, who injured his knee
in pre-season practice and may be
lost for the season. And now the
bugaboo has hit the other co-cap
tain, offensive guard Staman Ogilvie

1970 FOOTBALL SCHEDULE

THE RING-TUM PHI

Towson Trounces W&L, 34-14

In an interview before the game,
the Washington and Lee team physi-
sian, who requested to be kept an-
onymous, diagnosed the team’s prob-
lem as Offense Syndrome or in lay-
men’s terms, a lack of offense. The
Towson State Tigers capitalized
early on the disease to roll to a 34-
14 heated victory over the mighty
Blue,

If the coin toss is any indication
of who's going to have the luck
throughout the game, the Tigers
started out on the right foot. They
took the opening kickoff and march-
ed 70 yards to score the initial touch-
down climaxed by a 40 yard off-
tackle slant with 12:31 remaining
in the first quarter. The PAT was
good and the score stood 7-0. The
remainder of the first quarter stood
as a tight defense struggle, the Gen-
erals receiving excellent play from
Scott Neese, Dave Brooks and Frank
Evans. The opposing punters saw
plenty of action, each punting away
three times in the offensive stale-
mate,

The second quarter opened with
the General defensive unit forcing a
Tiger fumble on the W&L 21 yard
line to thwart a 35 yard march. But
all goodness soon ended as a tough

rush on quarterback Tom Van Am-
burgh batted the ball into the air
and a Tiger defensive lineman snat-
ched it and darted 35 yards for a
touchdown with 12:07 left in the
half. The conversion was good and
the score mounted in State’s favor,
14-0.

The Offensive Syndrome held
tightly on the Generals as they had
to punt away the next two times
they got the ball. But on their third
possession, a fumble recovery by the
Tigers on the W&L 38 yard line
spelled their certain doom. Two
plays later, a 33 yard pass com-
pletion put the Tigers on the W&L
2 yard line. Despite twice throwing
the Tigers back, the Generals could
not stop a 2 yard plunge with 5:29
left in the half. After the conversion,
the scoreboard told the grim story,
21-0.

Towson State just wouldn't give
up. They intercepted a Van Am-
burgh bomb, their second of the
half, on their own 32 yard line. Sev-
eral plays later, an arching 57 yard
touchdown pass through the Gen-
erals prevent defense with 1:19 left
vaulted the score to 27-0. The extra
point was blocked.

The Blue received the second half

 

kickoff but failed to move. Towson
immediately took possession and
guided itself 60 yards for a touch-
down only 1:40 into the third quar-
ter. The climax was a 43 yard off-
tackle sprint. The PAT was good
and the score stood an overwhelm-
ing 34-0. No offensive progress for
the Generals forced their seventh
punt of the game. Towson State
promptly moved to the W&L 20
yard line only to attempt a field goal
of 38 yards. which fell short. At this
point, Steve Fluharty, a sophomore,
came into the game to guide the
General's offense. For the first time
in the game, the offensive unit came
to light. Fluharty marched the team
from his own 20 to State’s 13 with
the completion of three passes to
Bruce Green and the help of a pen-
alty. The drive was thwarted though
by a Tiger interception at the 2.
But the Generals were rejuvenated,
and the defense handed Fluharty
the ball on the Towson State 41
after a short punt. With a pressure
completion to Green and a pass in-
terference call on Towson in the end
zone, the ball found its way to the
State 1 yard line. On the next play,
freshman Jim Farrar barreled over
with 1:00 left in the third quarter to
put the first W&L points on the
board. Green was on the receiving

 

fourth and short yardage situation
failed and the mighty Blue stalled.
Later, W&L received a punt on their
own 42 and following two comple-
tions to Green, one to the 2 yard
line, Jim Farrar battled his way over
for his second touchdown. The pass
conversion fell no good, the gun
sounded and the score ended 34-14.

Outstanding offensive _ perfor-
mances came from Steve Fluharty,
who completed 13 of 31
176 yards, and Green

who ended the day with 12 big re-

attempts

for Bruce

ceptions for 160 yards.

Macrobiotic Diet Made Possible
By Lightning Valley Food Store

(Continued from Page 3)

R-t Phi: How does a person eat
well:

Cook: By using his judgment in
what he eats; by knowing what food
is, and how particular foods affect
him.

R-t Phi: Are there any specific
foods that you would recommend?

Dillon: No, A man can eat any-
thing in the whole world.

Cook: Everybody should eat what
they want to eat.

"R-t Phi: Is there any system or philo-
sophy behind eating well?

Cook: There’s the macrobiotic
philosophy, about which we have
some written material available in
the store. The store itself is not push
ing macrobiotics; we're just present-
ing it as a possibility to anyone who's
interested.

R-t Phi: Well, just what is macro-
biotics?

Dillon: I'd say that macrobiotics

cine. Georges Oshawa, known as the
father of macrobiotics, claimed that
he could prevent or cure any disease
by prescribing a man’s diet,

Cook: As for ourselves, we're no
more macrobiotics than we are Niet-
zschean or Kantian, It’s just another
philosophy, but there’s a lot you
can learn from it.

Dillon: We're not trying to have

Dillon: What you can do is use
your toes...

R-t Phi: Do you agree that eating
good food can have an effect on the
mind?

Cook: Yes, definitely. If you con-
trol and balance your diet you can
think more clearly.

R-t Phi: Why is the average
American meal bad for a person?

Cook: Mainly because it’s so chao-
tic. There’s no understanding of what
he’s eating and hardly any style as
to how he prepares and eats his
food.

R-t Phi: Why have you called the
place the “Lightning Valley Food
Store”?

Dillon: It's a good image.

R-t Phi: Where do the foods in
the LVFS come from?

Cook: We order from Boston,
New York, Texas, Pennsylvania...
from all over the country.

R-t Phi: Do you have anything
that comes from Rockbridge County?

Cook: As a matter of fact we
have some apple blossom honey
from “Honey Bill” Jarvis who has
some bees at his place near Rock-
bridge Baths.

R-t Phi: What has been the re-
sponse of the Lexington Commun
ity to a health food store?

Dillon: Excellent.

Cook: Everyone thinks it’s a good
idea and that we'll be successful.

A Tribute To General Robert F. Lee

THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee University’s Weekly Newspaper

 

 

Volume LXX

Ceremonies For Lee Will

Be Conducted In Chapel

The hundredth anniversary of the
death of Robert E. Lee will be com-
memorated at Washington and Lee
University Oct. 10 during a special
ceremony in the Lee Chapel, which
he built in 1867 while he was presi-
dent of what was then Washington
College.

Lee died Oct. 12 on the campus in
the President's Home, also built dur-
ing his presidency of the institution.

The ceremony will also mark the
centennial of the decisions—both
made within weeks of Lee’s death—
by the college’s faculty and board of
trustees to re-name the institution,
incorporating Lee’s name with that
of Washington.

Robert Edward Royall Huntley,
Lee’s seventh successor as leader of
the university, will deliver the prin-
cipal address at the ceremony. Spec-
ial guests at the observance will be
a number of Gen. Lee’s descendants,
as well as officials of the United
Daughters of the Confedenrcy, the
Society of the Lees of Virginia, and
representatives of various histori-
cal organizations.

The noontime service will follow
a meeting in Lexington of Wash-
ington and Lee’s board of trustees,
and they will participate in the pro-
gram as well.

See Editorial Comment, Page 2

and Article, Page 3.

Oct. 10, the closest weekend date
to the actual anniversary of Lee's
death Oct. 12, 1870, will also bring
alumni from five graduating classes
back to the university for reunions.
Members of the Lee Associates, a
group of Washington and Lee's dis-
tinguished benefactors, will also
convene in Lexington that weekend
and will be honored guests for the
event, to which the public is invited.

Washingion and Lee University’s
glee club, under the direction of
james T. Cook, will sing several se-
lections during the program.

Lee’s death came almost exactly
five years after he arrived in Lexing-
ton to assume leadership of the de-
stitute, war-ravaged little school. He
had surprised nobody more than its
trustees when he accepted their bold
offer, for it involved a salary of only
$1,500 a year, and a social, educa
tional challenge that was almost
unbelievably formidable.

From 1865 to 1870, in what one

president of the university termed
“Lee's Final Achievement,” the de-
feated general transformed the un-
distinguished college into a thriivng
national university of major educa-
tional vitality — almost singlehand-
edly.

He died, apparently of a heart ail-
ment, in the dining room of the
house designed for him and Mrs. Lee
(and since occupied by each of his
successors). He was buried on Oct.
15, 1870, in the campus chapel he
designed and ‘built, where his wife,
parents, children and other relatives
are now buried with him.

Homecoming To Feature Sweetwater

BY CHARLEY TAYLOR

Homecoming weekend this year
brings something for everyone, be
they returning alumni or student.
Scheduled events range from the
University Dance Board’s Home-
coming concert to the grain party in
Red Square to Anniversary Class
banquets.

Highlights of the weekend include
meetings of the University Trustees
and Alumni Board of Directors; the
reunion of five classes; 1925, 1935,
1940, 1950, and 1965; Homecoming
itself; and special centennial com-
memorations of General Lee’s death
and the changing of Washington
College’s name to The Washington
and Lee University. There will also
be a special reception and banquet
for the Robert E. Lee Associates,
which, according to William C.
Washburn of the Alumni House, is
an association of exceptional bene-
factors of the University.

After the Homecoming football
game against Hampden-Sydney and
the crowning of the Homecoming
queen, a grain party sponsored by
the sophomore class and open to
everybody will feature music by
The Embers. The party will take
place in Red Square from 4:30 to

Concerning the Homecoming con-
cert, Roy Carlton of the Dance
Board noted that folk singer How-
ard Logan will appear first, followed

Dorm Parietals

Four men were nominated and
endorsed as candidates for the
Rhodes Scholarship in the Monday
afternoon faculty meeting. They
are Marvin C. Henberg. Stephen R.

Haughney, John Lillard Hl, and
Joseph B. Tompkins, Jr.
Other faculty business included

the election of professor Thomas G.
Nye to the Student Affairs Commit-
tee and action on proposed changes
for parietal procedures in the fresh-
man dorms.

Henberg. now a graduate student
in Philosophy at the University of
Texas, graduated summa cum laude
last June. While here, he was presi-
dent of the student body and a mem-
ber of Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron
Delta Kappa.

Haughney, an English major, is
second ranking man in the present
senior class. He has served on the
Student Curriculum Committee and
taught during the past summer in an
experimental high school in Cleve-
land. He was elected to Phi Beta
Kappa as a junior.

Lillard is eighth in a class of 51
enior lawyers and serves as assoc:
ate editor of the Law Review. He
has been a member of the University
Student Control Commiitee, chair-
man of the Grievance Committee
ind of the Honors and Awards Com
mittee of the Student Bar Associa
tion

Tompkins, a politics major, is
third man in the present senior class
academically and was elected to Phi
Beta Kappa his junior year. He was
elected to the student body Execu
live Commiticee as a freshman,
sophomore, and senior. As a junior

Effective Oct. 16

he was Vice-President of the stu-
dent body. He was one of four un-
dergraduates in the nation to at-
tend the eight-week program of the
Federal Executive Institute.

The basic change in the plan for
freshman dorm self-government pass-
ed by the faculty was a speeding up
of the date when freshman parietal
plans will go into effect. Under this
years plan, the freshman parictals
can begin by the fifth weekend after
class beginnings (this year, Oct. 16).

During the interim period until
self-determined parietals begin, fresh-
man may have girls visiting the
dorms during the following hours:
Friday from 7:00 p.m. until mid-
night, Saturday from 1:00 p.m. un-
til midnight, and Sunday from 1:00
p.m. until 5:00 p.m.

The new proposals were presented
to the Student Affairs Committee
last week by Phil Thompson on be-
half of the freshman dorm coun-
selors. The plan met with the unani-
mous approval of SAC and was en-
dorsed by the faculty.

The meeting was attended by Siu-
dent Body President Fran Lawrence
and Vice President Phil Thompson
Lawrence made the customary pres-
entation given by the Student Body
president on the honor system. He
also requested that faculty mem-
bers on an individual basis cooperate
with individual students who wish to
make plans to leave campus to cam
paign for candidates this fall. No ac
tion was taken on Lawrence's plea,
but Lawrence expressed confidence
that students would meet with gen

EC Tackles Budget;
Discusses Finances

BY RITA ENNIS

Budget problems are plaguing the
Executive Committee. Considerable
time was spent in Monday night's
committee meeting discussing the
Operational possibilities of a Stu-
dent Body Budget as well as fund
allocations, especially to the Stu-
dent Bar Association.

The Student Finance Committee
(consisting temporarily of Senior
Representative Joe Tompkins and
Vice ‘President Phil Thomp-
son) presented an auditor's state-
ment of expenditures for the 1969-70
session. The audit revealed that the
EC spent $1636.77 last year and
that the Student Body Reserve Fund
is dwindling. The Executive Com-
mittee has approximately $2000 for
disbursement this year. The Finance
Committee was established to con-
sider financial problems and the feas-
ibility of an operational budget.
Three additional committee mem-
bers are being sought.

Student Bar Association President
Rob Hartmann submitted a request
for $900 in additional funds. (At
present SBA receives 4Sc per Univer-
sity student from the Student Acti-
vities Fee.) Hartmann saw his re-
quest as an “interim measure” until
an $20-$30 tuition raise for the Law
School students could be obtained
to cover costs,

Noting that the Law School stu-
dent body has increased at least 25
per cent this year, Hartmann re-
quested the additional funds primar-
ily for social events and an expand-
ed speaker program. A lengthy dis-
cussion followed in which the follow-
ing arguments were brought for-
ward:
la) The Law School students pay
the same Activities Fee as un-
dergraduates, yet receive little
benefit from the Calyx, Ring-
tum Phi, or Ariel,

Phe EC makes an annual alloca-
tion of approximately $400 to
the Law Review to balance the
Activities Fee inequities.
2a) SBA needs money to cover soc-
ial events through the year
Hartmann contends these are
basic and important functions
for the Law School.
2b) Undergraduate entertainment is
not subsidized by the EC. Un
dergraduates pay class dues.
fraternity dues, dance plan and
admission fees to cover costs
The Speaker Program, which
should be an asset at a Law
School, is severly lacking ai
WAL. Since undergrads would
also benefit from an expanded
Program, the EC should sub
sidize the program
3b) Undergraduates do not rely on
EC subsidies for speaker pro
grams. They pay Contact assess
ments which Law Students do

Ib)

not pay. Admission fees could
be charges to cover speaker
costs.

President Fran Lawrence referred
action of the SBA request to the
Student Finance Committee.

An allocation of $275 for a mim-
eograph machine for the use of
the EC was unanimously approved.
When time is available, the machine
may also be used by students at cost
plus 10 per cent. President Law-
rence noted that reduced printing
costs, time saved, and the need for
better communications with the stu-
dents justified this expense.

In other EC action, the Freshman
election schedule was announced,
committee and subcommittee reports
were presented, and Alumni weck-
end events were disclosed.

Lawrence also announced that he
appeared before the Monday after-
noon faculty meeting to encourage
cooperation of the faculty should
some students chose to leave camp-
us in the time prior to elections to
work in a political campaign. He
urged faculty members to “act on an
individual basis” to help the students
make up work on test missed during
such an absence.

Petitions for Freshman Election
participation are due to Rich Mur-
ray by Oct. 12 and must have 50
signatures. Primary elections are slat-
ed for Oct. 19; runoff elections Oct.
22. Freshmen should not apply for
membership on standing committees
until after class elections.

In a report from the Cold Check
Committee, Chairman Henry Harke:
noted the committee has $100-$150
in extra reserve funds which could
be reallocated to an EC project.
Harkey is to report on possible uses
of the funds at a later date. Unanim
ous approval of the EC greeted Har-
key’s proposed name change for his
committee to “the Student Financial
Relations Committee.”

Phil Thompson reported that the
recruitment of volunteers for the
Honor System Study Committee ex
ceeded his expectations and that the
committee size may be increased up
to 25 members, “A largerthan-com
mon committee membership could
facilitate,” said Thompson, “the
gfeatest amount of involvement pos-
sible in this type of investigation.”
A meeting of committee membe:
applicants is scheduled for tomor
row at 7:30 p.m. in the EC room.

Glen Azuma, Junior Represents
live, told the EC that the Consiitu
tion Committee had made some pro
gress but were not ready to consider
membership applications or definite
future action

THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

OCTOBER 7, 1970

The Payne 21 Paradox

Payne 21. The name of the building and the number of the
room appear on a small quantity of class schedule sheets mys-
teriously printed by an IBM machine at the beginning of each
term. The classroom is similar to any other in the building, or
for that matter, to any other on campus. Except for a small
metal plaque outside the entrance to the room,

There, on October 2, 1865, General Robert le. Lee became
President Robert E. Lee, and a small cow college with a corn
field for a front lawn began to change because of that one
man.

So? One might gaze about this campus and point to this
plaque or that building and say, “General Lee was here,” or,
“he was responsible for this.’ Everyone will smile vaguely and
walk away with another fact that can recite about the man.

But people are not plaques or buildings. General Lee was
a man who will never be known; and to clutch at the straws of
memorabilia in attempt to capture his essence can only serve
to dim his true brilliance as a man.

We are not interested in how he has affected present day
Washington and Lee. To us, the motivation behind his meteo
ric career at Washington College is the essence of the man.

The following excerpt from Clifford Dowdey’s “Lee” cap-
tures a glimpse of his spirit—a spirit which still remains at the
institution which now bears his name along with Washngton’s.

“To Lee, education for the future depended as much on char
acter as learning, and to him character was built upon the
habits of self-control. He did not believe that intelligent self-
government in men would be promoted by forcing students
under compulsion, supported by penalties, to perform class
assignments and conform to rules of personal behavior.

“... Lee tended by appeal to force a boy to look at himself
as a man to who the president had extended the courtesy of as-
suming he came of a good home in which he had been inculeat-
ed with honor, honesty, a conscience and self-respect.”

The only way a man can ever unknowingly attain immor
tality is for him to instill some measure of what he humbly con-
siders ethically valuable amongst others about him.

Pulling Out Of A Crash Dive

Last week we sat in the Executive Committee's meeting

room and listened as Mock Convention Chairman Dan Sil-
berberg presented a plea to that body for more money. $600 to
be exact. And that was, according to Silberberg, “sort of a
loan.

Last year we sat in the same room and listened as Mr.

Silberberg went begging to the EC for $200 to defray the cost
of what he then termed plans for summer mailings by state
chairmen for the 1972 Mock Convention. And yet no mailings
were made. In fact, at this very moment, Mr. Silberberg has
only 30 state chairmen working for him. And he needs money
again for mailings he said he was going to make last year
What concerns us is that if the EC does not thoroughly re

Mr

Convention is allowed to rock along as it apparently has in the

view Silberberg’s activities so far, and the 1972 Mock
past, there may as well be no Mock Convention in 1972 be

Logan Discusses Exchange

Hollins: ‘Pint-Sized University?’

BY LAWRENCE McCONNELL
and
MACK WOODWARD

(Editor’s Note: This article is the
second in a series of interviews with
administrators in various colleges
participating in the exchange pro-
gram. Dr. Logan, President of Hol-
lins College, is a graduate of Yale
University. Dean Wheeler is Dean
of Academics at Hollins College.)

The Ring-tum Phi: Why did Hol-
lins decide to enter into the ex-
change program with the other
schools? :

President Logan: Well, | suspect
that all of us had similar reasons
for doing it: we wanted, for
thing, to take advantage of the var
iety of academic experiences that
the eight schools offer. We're not all
identical by any means. There are
things to be had in some places that
aren't had in others

And we never expected the ex-
change program to be entirely co

educational: it's perfectly

one

possiblc

for a man to go to another men’s
school or a girl to go to another
girl's school. It has turned out, in

co-education
each of us a

any case, to be largely
al, and it has
glimpse of co-education, which has
been one of its advantages

R-¢ Phi: But there was no thought
in mind that one day Hollins would
go co-educational?

Logan: I don't think there isn't a
single this that
isn't considering the

our minds, that we

have to go co-educational

irying to tes ao

was possible for a wo
i

mans college to

remain a womans

but offer certain of its pro-
grams to men.

Logan: We don't intend to change
our curriculum.

R-t Phi: Dean Wheeler, do you
think that the exchange program
will continue in the future?

Wheeler: | have every expecta-
tion; we would like to see it grow
considerably. Let me elaborate on
one point the President made a
moment ago, and that’s in regard to
broadening the academic opportuni-
ties and at the same time enjoying
certain economics. With all of these
institutions together, you have 2
“pint-sized university.” Now we're
all trying to offer as broad a pro-
gram as possible; I think we can
move toward some degree of speciali-
zauion,

college,

For example, the bio-chemical
facilities. I think there is no need
for more than one real good facility
in the set-up, but if all of us try to
that, it is terrifically expen-
sive. So actually, this exchange pro-
gram may work into a very regular
of thing where students with
specific needs might simply move to
the institution that offers those facil-
ities for that sort of experience.

R-t Phi: Dr. Logan, have you
noticed any trend in applications
that would have caused you to loox
into co-education?

Logan: | think that every small,
liberal arts, private college has ex-
perienced some decline in the num-
ber of applicants since the peak in
the mid-Sixties. Of course, the popu-
lation has leveled off, too, and you
couldn't expect a definite increase.

Wheeler: The applications for next

‘fer

sort

year that are already in for next
year are significantly ahead of Iasi
year ina very important category

early decision.

For example, last year | guess we
had 66 early decision students in all:
as of Friday (25 September) we had
72 with a week to go until the dead-
line

R-t Phi: I've noticed that at other
schools, including WAL, this year’s
freshman class has increased in size,
while applications have decreased
Has this been due to a monetary fac
lor or were enough students qualified
or did you have the room and could
expand?

Logan: We've had

a phased in-

 

crease over the past three years, an!
we've had the space after acquiring
the Hollins apartments. We antici-
pate a slight increase again nexi
year when we have more of the
apartments available.

R-t Phi: In what we've ascertained
so far in interviews, co-education as
a 50-50 ratio is not going to help
the small, private unisex college.
I'm sure it would cost too much.

Logan: We have a study coming
out this year which deals with the
contingency planning of such an
operation. .. . Of course, if you're

about endowment,

talking
talking about money like {$15 mil
lion),

Wheeler: It's not a simple econo-

you re

mic question. If those men come
here and are interested in the same
things that are popular with women,
we're going to be worse off with th:
men than without them. We will not
be exploiting the staff we have, but
we may be forced to add staff to
ake care of the increased wort
load.

The question facing the small, li-
beral arts education may be in co
education in the short run, but is
really, in the long run in financing
this kind of education. I'm sure that
this college or any college can go on
Operating on the same fiscal base
as it has in the past, depending pri
marily on student needs. Something
else has to be phased into the

tem. Probably what we need is for
the government to think of subsidiz-
ing the individual rather than the in-
stitution, and let the market forces
play, and if the private schools are
better than the public, so much the
better—or the other way around.

R-t Phi: What about the possibility
of having one sink fund for the eight
schools on the exchange program,
and letting one man—Financial Di
rector or whatever—go out and soli-
cit donations, contributions, scholar-
ships, etc. to be divided among
these eight schools. Has that possibil-
ity ever been considered?

Logan: Not yet, in our discussions
This has happened in other places
certain kinds of coordinated organi-
zations. It’s perfectly conceivable
that this could happen. That's not
part of anybody's real plan. There
are possibilities in this for the future

R-t Phi: What effect has inflation
had on Hollins? Have you had to cu
down on your budgets for this year,
and what sort of development plans
do you have for the coming year?

Wheeler: We're operating in the
black and we anticipate operating in
the black next year, even with the
current rate of fees and so on. Al!
of our expenses going up. We
have cut faculty size since last yeat
but this was because of attrition
not replacing certain faculty mem
bers who left. We have not let the
economy move affect anything that
relates to the quality.

R+ Phi; Has inflation held up
the construction of buildings?

Logan: A couple of things have

Lee:
A Legend
Or An Archaic

Anachronism?

BY ROMULUS WEATHERMAN
Director of Publications

Is Robert E. Lee in this year of 1970—the
1undredth anniversary of his death—an ana-
‘hronism? A sophisticated society that exalts
he anti-hero might say so. It is true that the
egend-makers have tended to distort Lee by
naking him the symbol of all the desperate
dealism that once supported the Lost Cause.
Phe poet Sidney Lanier saw Lee gently sleep-
ng at outdoor church services on the Peters-
vurg front and wrote: “Not a muscle of him
stirred, not a nerve of his grand countenance
witched, there was no drooping of the head
ior bowing of the figure... . As he slumbered

so, sitting erect with his arms folded upon his
chest in an attitude of majestic repose such
as I never saw assumed by mortal man before

. it seemed to me as if the present earth
floated off through the sunlight and the anti-
que earth returned out of the past and some
majestic god sat on a hill sculptured in stone
presiding over a terrible yet sublime contest
of human passions.” Much later a clergyman,
standing before the tomb of Lee, broke into
reverential ecstasy: “The greatest man on
earth since the days of St. Paul!” Thus did the
legend take root and flourish so that it is diffi-
cult to separate Lee the man from Lee the
myth,

The mention of his name today often
brings cynical smiles. But the modern depre-
cators of Lee overlook the intense humanity
of the man. Lee in his own mind was anything
but a majestic figure. Lee often yearned for
nothing more than life on a small farm sur-
rounded by the family he loved. He frequent-
ly doubted his ability; he even questioned
whether he was worthy of the grace of God in
whom he so fervently believed. His paramount
virtues were self-mastery and_ self-denial,
which gave his character a near perfection
that some of his closest friends found boring.
But he could no more elude nobility than a
leopard can change his spots. Nobility was in
his nature, his humanity.

How was it that Lee, who was forced to
make a cruel and narrow choice for which
other men in other times might have been
hanged, emerged in the end as a hero rever-
ed by friend and foe? A part of the answer is
that he had no ambition except the conscious-
ness of duty faithfully performed. The two
maxims that summed up his philosophy were
“Do your duty” and “Human virtue should
be equal to human calamity.”

This philosophy he exhibited in full mea-
sure when in 1865 he surprised the trustees of
Washington College by accepting their au-
dacious invitation to become president of
what at war’s end was little more than a few
dilapidated buildings and an honorable name.
Lee the warrior had become Lee the reconcil-
iator. He did not look back. He refused to
sustain the open wounds of war; he sought to
heal them; he devoted his energy and influ-
ence to restoring harmony to a divided na-
tion. He saw in the presidency of Washing-
ton College an opportunity to do what he
could to help rebuild a torn economic and

social order. “I have,” he said, “a self-imposed
task which I cannot forsake.”

Lee’s innovative accomplishments at the
College constituted what has been aptly call-
ed the “Augustan Age” in the history of
Washington and University. It

Che central objective of his administra-
tion was to create and fortify an institution
that would minister to the greatly changed
civilization of his people. Strengthening first
the processes of culture, as the basis of all
true education, he addressed himself to the
new demands. Not in a spirit of pdagogical
experimentation, but with a definite under-
standing of the social order which was to be
developed, he transformed the curriculum of
the ancient classical school.

“Here was a New South that would need
legislation, legal adjustment, legal interpreta-
tion, and Lee added a division of law. Here
was a New South that must see broad utili-
zation of natural resources and emphasis up-
on transportation, and Lee added a school of
engineering. Here was a New South that
would pass at least in part from the agrarian
mode of the plantation to the order of busi-
ness ,and Lee projected a school of com-
merce, probably the first ever planned upon
collegiate levels, though the project waited
many years for its fulfillment. Here was a
New South that required intelligent guidance
in the formulation of public opinion, and Lee
organized a course in journalism.

Although Lexington’s city fathers
have not scored a multitude of
points with many people recently,
particularly with Washington and
Lee students, they have embarked
on a plan which may spawn an-
other Jim Brown, Alex Karras, or
Johnny Unitas.

The City of Lexington has taken
upon itself to sponsor a little league
football conference consisting of ele-
ven, twelve, and thirteen year old
Four teams play each other

twice to make up a six game sche-
dule. Bach team is complete with
coaching staff, play sets, insurance
| on players and physicals. Local re-
sidents volunteer as coaches, and
each team works up a series of
about thirty plays. One team, the

serving as line coaches.

who prefer to remain
anonymous, agreed that the whole
experience is fun. “It gives us a

| chance to shape values,” said one,
“and provides a tremendous feeling
of usefulness.”

Asked about the success of the
program, one coach predicted, “Some
of these guys could become great
ballplayers. No doubt about it, some
boys out there have tremendous

| potential.”

Games are held each Saturday at
Lexington High School, and contests

noon for about an hour and a half,
One of the most important aspects
of the program is that it is biracial.
Although the whites outnumber the
blacks, the teams are mixed in order
to facilitate companionship and
sportsmanship. Tolerance in race re-
lations must begin as soon as man’s
communication with others occurs,

and healthy competition is a con-
cept as old as history.
Currently, the program includes

about 120 boys, thirty to a team.
Unfortunately, the possibilities of
expansion are slim due to the lack of
numbers. Just about every interested
boy in the city is participating. This
leaves two means for expansion. The
league can either begin to take in
boys from the surrounding areas,
(Rockbridge Baths, or even Buena
Vista), or it can expand the age
limit to take in ten year olds, many
of whom already practice in the
afternoons with the big teams, Both
plans have their merits but also their
defects.

rhe teams have all played half of
their six scheduled games and plans
are in the offing for an all-star game,
which means at least one more
month of Saturday morning ball for
the youngsters.

So if any of you find the cartoons
boring and that morning keg stale,
head out to Lexington High School
and watch the kids play—you ma)

Soccer Team Boots Madison, 1-0

BY CURT JAMISON

The Washington and Lee Soccer
Generals finally managed to get on
the board in the win column last
Friday with an imposing 1-0 vic-
tory over Madison College.

Madison, through its concentrat-
ed efforts to build a soccer power,
brought a vastly improved though
still completely outclassed club to
Lexington. It appears to this ob-
server that the Generals have fin-

ally begun to understand the com-
plexities of the basically new 3-3-4
alignment developed by Coach Joe
Lyles this year.

This system is conducive to do-
minant ball control in the defensive
and middle areas of the field. Its
only shortcoming seems to be its
lack of offensive thrust in the for-
ward zone. In order to penetrate
the defensive secondary of the op-
ponent, the center forward in this

3-3-4 alignment must work closely
with his halfbacks rather than with
the insides as in years past. Until
Friday’s game, the W&L halfbacks
had been straying too far into their
own defensive zone, which prevent-
ed them from switching quickly to
ihe offensive after a turnover.

After a scoreless first half which
saw the Generals fire shot after shot
at the Madison goalie the home club
really went to work. The second half

 

Hank Slauson, a capheman, toes ball goalward. The Generals beat Madison 1-0 on Friday.

Two W@L Punts Blocked;
One Returned 72 Yards;
Martin Rushes 101 Yards

BY PETER JONES

Centre College of Kentucky, rid-
ing the back of luck, rolled to a 40-
6 victory over the Washington and
Lee Generals,

As the game began, it looked as
though the Generals were here to
prove they could grind out a con-
vincing offense. After having receiv-
ed the opening kickoff, Centre prom-
ptly fumbled the ball away to Tom
Kent on their own 38  yardline.
Sophomore Steve Fluharty came in
to swiftly guide the Blue in nine
plays to the Centre end zone, capp-
ed by freshman fullback Jim Farrar’s
plunge of 36 inches to score his third
I'D of the season with 11:22 re
maining in the first quarter. The
point attempt was blocked but the
Generals were experiencing their
first lead of the season.

But that didn’t last long. The Gen-
eral defense, contending with tough
Centre rushing backfield and tough
luck, had its work cut out the rest
of the game. Centre took the kick-
off, marched methodically downfield
and tied the score on a 13 yard end
run with 8:02 left in the first quar-
ter. The run for the two-point con-
version was successful and W&L
suddenly found themselves behind
again, 8-6.

The W&L offense couldn't muster
any drive after the kickoff, and Cen-
tre soon found out they had the
same complex as the first quarter
came nearer to a close. Yet, just be-
fore the quarter gun, Centre man-
aged a short but deep drive into Blue
territory and with only :42 gone in
the second quarter, scored on a one-
yard run. The conversion set the
Generals further behind, 15-6.

Still controlling the offense and
the clock, Centre rambled down to
the W&L four and conveniently
completed a TD pass with 5:31 left
in the half. The extra point attempt
was true and the Generals were
looking at a 22-6 deficit.

Fluharty did master a precision
drive down to the Centre 17 yardline
right before the half, but the steam
ran out as did the downs and the
time.

WAL received the second kickoff
determined to come back. The de-
fense magnificiently held the Centre
rushing game, but the offense failed
to capitalize on anything. Punting
midway into the third quarter, the
Generals failed to recognize a burst
of speed and a few fakes and watch

ed Centre’s running back Ely run 72

yards with the ball for a TD with
5:31 remaining in the third quarter.
The conversion run failed; the score
stood 28-6,

Seemingly undaunted, the W&l
offense racked up a 69 yard drive to
the Centre eleven, capped by JoJo
Martin’s 48 yard off-tackle sprint.
As luck would have it, an intercep-
tion in the endzone thwarted yet an-
other drive.

The Blue defense opened the
fourth quarter with a fumble recov-
ery on the Centre 37. Again, after
moving to the 17 yardline, the small
technical rule of four downs to
make a first claimed the drive. The
game was all but too far gone to re-
cover. Centre scored twice again on
runs of one and five yards respec
tively. Both conversions failed and
the score ended 40-6

A Tag Clarification ...

WAL students need not buy both
ciyt and county tags. City tags are
required within the limits of Lexing-
ton, and county tags are to be pur-
chased by those whose residences
are outside Lexington.

Freshmen owning cars are requir-
ed to have tags and should purchase
the Lexington denomination, The
only students owning cars who are
exempt from the local tag regula-
tions are those who have tags from
another city or county in the Com-
monwealth of Virginia.

Both city and county tags can be
purchased between October 1 and

Telephone Tax
For Residents
In City Limits

BY JOHN ROBINSON

Have you ever looked closely at
your telephone bill? With a bit of
scrutiny, you would notice your
“local tax” total. This represents
a City of Lexington tax on local
rates and services.

The City Council approved this
tax June 20, 1968 to increase its
sources of income. As the ordinance
is written, only local services and
rates are subject to taxation. A maxi-
mum of 20% can be levied on local
expenditures of $10 on personal
phones and $50 on business phones.

Dale C. Ramey, local manager
for the Virginia Telephone and
Telegraph Company, explained that
most private student phones require
a flat rate of $6.50 every month.
This results in a local tax of $1.30.

lt is important to remember this
tax does not apply to long distance
calls. However, service charges such
as installation of extension phones
would be subject to taxation.

Guy B. Agnor, Lexington City
Manager, said, “This telephone tax
only rarely reaches its maximum of
$10. On the other hand, gas and
electricity taxes often reach their
maximums due to the seasonal de-
mands for these services.”

Agnor also revealed that this tele-
phone tax makes a substantial con-
tribution to the city budget. Last
year the city anticipated $130,000 in
revenue from this particular tax.
The actual revenue was $136,353.
This sum was deposited in the gen-
eral fund. This amount of money
was approximately 11% of the city
government's revenue.

How does Lexington’s rate com-
pare with other local telephone tax
rates? For the Commonwealth of
Virginia Lexington’s rate is high.
According to Tax Rates in Virginia
Cities and Urban Counties, 1968 by
Donald C. Dixon, only one city in
Virginia (Alexandria) has a higher
rate, Nonetheless, Lexington does
have a maximum which is not true
in many localities.

So, if you are upset by the size
of your phone bill, maybe you can
take pride in the fact Lexington’s
general fund has benefited by your
sucrifices,

EC Appointed Group

Investigates Car Tax

BY RITA ENNIS

The Legal Aid and Research Com-
mittee of the Law School has been
commissioned by the Executive
Committee to study the required
Lexington automobile license tags
for students.

After last week refusing to take a
stand on the issue, the EC in its
Monday night meeting unanimously
requested the Research Committee
to determine the exact legal points of
the ordinance, to present a memor-
andum to the EC as soon as possible,
and, if necessary, to begin proced-
ings for a class suit on behalf of all
out-of-state students.

The EC also heard a progress re-
port from Dan Silberberg concern-
ing the 1972 Mock Democratic Con-
vention, named members to the
Honor System Subcommittee and
passed changes in the Conference
Fund Committee.

Discussion regarding the license
tag ordinance began following a re-
quest made by junior John O'Neal.
In his statement, O'Neal asked the
EC to take a definite stand on the
ordinance. He stated that aside from
legal grounds, the ordinance was “in-
herently unjust.” Discussion follow-
ed which ultimately led to the com-
missioning of the Legal Aid and Re-
search Commitiece. Action on
O'Neil’s request was postponed un-
til the Research Committee issues
its memorandum.

See Letter to the Editor, Page 2,

Silberberg, in his report, refuted
The Ringtum Phi editorial of last
week. He stated that he was far
ahead of Steve Saunders (1968 Mock
Convention Chairman) in prepara-
tion and money requests for the
Convention. (Silberberg had earlier
spoken with Saunders to verify this.)
In his progress report Silberberg not-
ed that information pamphlets were
ready for printing as soon as funds
ure available, The EC unanimously
approved a $50 allocation for im-
mediate Operating expenses.

Vice President Phil Thompson an-
nounced the membership of the
Honor System Subcommittee. In ad-
dition to Thompson and EC mem-
bers Don Weir and Chris Jones, 13
members were appointed to the Sub

Interfraternity
Council Studies
Food Buying

Tuesday night's Inter-Fraternity
Council meeting saw the culmina-
tion of the effort to coordinate the
cooperative food buying plan for the
fraternities. The IFC has been check-
ing with all the houses over the past
few weeks to compare prices and
sound out the reactions of the house-
mothers and cooks,

Several fraternities demonstrated
reluctance to go along with the plan,
the chief reason being that they felt
that they would not save that much
money and the effort would not be
justified unless a considerable sum
was saved. There was also some re-
luctance on the part of several
houses to cooperate as they felt that
they would lose money in the ven-
ture, especially when Mr. Jerry Dar-
rell’s services would be recompensed
at the rate of $5 per house per week

The chief worry of those fraterni
ties who favored the plan was the
reserve fund, which with fifteen
houses cooperating would come to
$200 per house. If there was a signi
ficant reduction in the number of
houses participating, the amount
required from each house would in
crease, Bruce Madison, treasurer of

the Beta house, stated that he
couldn't see tying up three or four
hundred dollars when people
wouldn't go into the plan

After long discussion, the plan
was passed by the IFC, A meeting

will be held Thursday night in the
Student Union with the cooks and
housemothers present to discuss im
plementation of the plan

Bruce Madison, Social Chairman
of the IFC, announced plans to ac
cumulate data from the houses on
the combos that they have used in
the past, focusing primarily on book
ing agencies, combo ratings, and
prices so that a cross-reference
guide may be made available to al!
fraternities

Doug Gossmann, President of th
IFC, called for the
committee to study

creation of
parietal rule
that were in effect last year to evalu
rte them and determine whether an
revisions are in order for this year

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
OCTOBER 14, 1970

«> Whatever Happened To
The Ring-tum Phi?

Last week someone complained about The Ring-tum Phi.
We wish this fact were noteworthy enough to be placed on
page one with a banner headline. But, as we know only too
well, the odds are better on someone’s vocal disgruntlement
with the newspaper than they are on the outside chance the sun
won't rise tomorrow.

So if complaints about an opinion, or poor copy, or typos,
or a missing notice, or poor pictures, or lack of coverage, or
bad headlines, or a ridiculous name aren't anything new, what
makes this year’s expression of malcontent different from that
of any other year? We believe a large portion of the objections
about The Ring-tum Phi are based implicitly on the words
which now appear under our mast on page one: “Washington
and Lee University’s Weekly Newspaper.”

The glorious eras of The Tuesday and Friday Ring-tum
Phis were ended by the Publications Board last year due to
rising publication costs and insufficient funds in the Publica-
tions Board budget to meet the higher price of two news-
papers. Neither editorial boards of the newspapers were pleas-
ed about the merger; the Publications Board effected the
change only out of necessity. The Ring-tum Phi, its editors and
readership have been simply caught in the common ailment of
the day—the inflationary grip.

We seriously question whether one weekly newspaper can
serve the needs of the Washington and Lee community of
students, faculty, administration, parents, and alumni. Witness
the following six points which were cited in an article on the
merger appearing in The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi January 13,
1970:

“Six general reasons were cited in the [Publications
Board's] subcommittee report for recommending consolidation
of the two Ring-tum Phis. They are as follows:

“1. The consolidation of the two present staffs would
improve the overall qaulity [sic] of the writing in the paper,
since more time would be devoted to writing and editing
copy.

“2. The paper would serve its readers better by provid-
ing enhanced coverage of newsworthy events.

“3. The danger of being understaffed during the short-
term periods would be lesser with an enlarged staff.

“4. The increasing cost of publishing The Ring-tum
Phi; a six page edition would show a savings.

“5. Problems of distribution and readership of the Fri-
day Edition (because of the five-day class week) would be
obviated with a Thursday Edition.

“6. These recommendations would enhance the status
of working on The Ring-tum Phi both as Editor and especi-
ally as an underclassman. Understaffing has become an in-
creasingly difficult problem over the past few years.”

Of all of the above reasons for the merger then, we can see
only one which is valid—one weekly saves money. As for the
other cited reasons, we cannot seriously reject the timeliness of
two newspapers a week for the elusive term “quality” in one
weekly edition (although it may be appropriate at this point
to note that the publishing date for The Ring-tum Phi is
Wednesday, thus making it somewhat more timely). Staffing
has not been any problem for the newspaper this year, and we
suspect that were there two editions, adequate staffs could be
had for both. Distribution of the Friday Edition would be
simpler if the newspaper went to press earlier in the day, thus
setting its deadlines back several hours into Thursday.

And finally we come to our main objection to one news-
paper—the forum for opinion and space for the presentation
of news is cut by approximately 25 percent. This tends not to
be a good thing for the editors of one edition who receive
criticism from members of the community because an article
was not printed due to lack of space. And it also makes it even
more difficult for an editor to attempt to capture as many of
the divergent points of view as there are people on this camp-
us. But most important of all, the readership of the newspaper
suffers ; and frankly, we see little hope of accomplishing what
eight pages did in the past within our present six pages, Not
that it can't be done. It just can't be done as well.

The Ring-tum Phi presently receives $3.18 from each stu-
dent via the student tax yielding a total of $4,452 in revenue
from 1400 students. Cost of the newspaper you're now hold-
ing? $275 an issue, or $8425 for the year. Approximately 20
percent of the rest of the total will be defrayed by subseriptions
and the remaining 30 percent will be covered by advertisers.
The estimated price of two four page editions for this year
is $10,200, and the difference between the two costs is $1,775,

To finance two newspapers, The Ring-tum Phi needs at least
$4.18 from each student. The difference of $375 can be met by
slightly increasing advertising space (which is, due to space
demands at present, the smallest we've seen in contrast to
other college newspapers in the area), The increase of $1 in the
student tax may sound ludicrous (and is impossible) this year,
but surely not for next year.

In the meantime, we see only one possible measure which
could be taken to allow The Tuesday and Friday Ring-tum
Phis to be resurrected this year: the Executive Committee
could appropriate enough funds to the Publications Board to
cover the cost of printing two Ring-tum Phis each week, They
could and should,

BY JOE TOMPKINS

“When in charge, ponder; when in
trouble, delegate; when in doubt,
mumble.”

This is the motto of the National
Association of Professional Bureau-
crats, a group which supplies its
members with executive pencils with
erasers on ‘both ends and which
stands ready to help get you back to
a confused and furious standstill.

The Association speaks in jest,
but on the basis of what the aver-
age citizen sees of the bureaucracy,
the above statements are not beyond
belief.

This summer I had the experience
of living with over 40 super-grade
federal executives (GS 16, 17, and
18) the “head” bureaucrats, for
eight weeks, and it was a truly mean-
ingful session. Along with three
other undergraduates from the Uni-
versity of South Dakota, the Uni-
versity of Nevada, and San Jose
State College, California, respective-
ly, I was chosen to be one of the
first undergraduates to attend the
Federal Executive Institute in Char-
lottesville, Virginia. Our participa-
tion was sponsored by the Ford
Foundation.

The FEI is a residential institute
which has been in existence for two
years. It is concerned with Executive
Development and seeks to contribute
to more effective leadership perfor-
mance by executives in two ways: by
strengthening individual capabilities
and by giving a better understanding
of the leadership role.

The executives in my session were
from a broad spectrum of govern-
ment agencies including Transporta-
tion, CIA, Post Office, Interior, NSA,
Treasury, NASA, HUD, Commerce,
National Park Service, and the mili-
tary services. Typically, the partici-
pants were between 45 and 55 years
old, had been in the civil service for
15 to 20 years, lived in comfortable
homes in the suburbs and had col-
lege, and sometimes graduate de-
grees.

We were all participants in a
learning community in which execu-
tive undergraduates and faculty
members were all viewed as equals.
We were all “students” and soon
found that, indeed, we could all
learn from one another. The educa-
tional methods included seminars,
lectures, discussion field trips, and
group and individual study. Field
trips were taken to Ottawa, Canada,
Washington, D.C. and Richmond.

We had guest lecturers at least
three times a week, most of whom
were from the upper levels of the
executive and legislative branches of
government. The atmosphere was
casual and related and I found it
very conducive to education and
learning Recreation was an integral
part of the program. A daily volley-
ball game was conducted from 4-5:30
p.m. Considering the victims nature
of the competition, the injuries were
light: one broken knee, several
sprained ankles, and a few dislocated
fingers.

I write this article about my ex-
perience with a dual purpose ‘in
mind. First, | want to share my per-
ception of these men who hold im-

portant positions in the bureaucracy.
Secondly, I would like to express my
feelings as to how some of the con-
cepts of a real learning community
can ‘be applied to our university,

Living with a group of people for
eight weeks in succession allows one
to know and understand his collea-
gues well, so the comments I make
stem not from hasty observation. I
speak in generalizations and I should
make it clear that there are excep-
tions to what I say.

Typically, the government execu-
tive is devoted to his work, spend-
ing between 50-70 hours per week
doing his job. He is usually a spec-
ialist or technician in a specific area
and has little knowledge of events
taking place outside his bailiwick.

Most of these men share the char-
acteristics of tunnel-vision resistance
to change, a pragmatic practical ap-
proach to life and daily situations, a
loss of esthetic appreciation, and
very little empathy or sensitivity to
feelings whether they be their own or
those of others. To most, develop-
ment is measured in terms of moving
up the GS rating scale or receiving
a greater salary, with little or no
consideration given to spiritual, men-
tal educational, or creative develop-
ment.

Many executives bear great inse-
curity in regard to certain fundamen-
tal personal trats e.g. — ability to
communicate with others, ability to
be accepted by a group—and it ap-
pears that many have compensated
for this perceived deficiency by be-
coming experts or specialists in a
particular area in which they can be-
come the undisputed authority.
Whether the insecurity caused the
specialization or vice versa is not
clear, but I suspect it is the former.

Most executives feel an identity
with their job and are strong advo-
cates of their particular group or
agency. Politics and politicians are
particularly distasteful subjects for
most executives, for most of them
have appeared before congressional
appropriations committees and have
been outmaneuvered and sent away
disappointed. Realizing that they
must fight the politicians on their
terms, most executives seek actively
to learn the tactics and methods
necessary for combat in the political
arena.

I make these statements not as an
indictment of the federal executives,

for I think the word which best de- «

scribes my feeling toward them is
sympathy. I see most of these men
as having tried to do what they think
best and having attempted to im-
prove things around them when they
entered the civil service. However,
over the years, their attempts at in-
novations have been rebuffed and
they now bear so many battle scars
and have been knocked down so
many times that they feel it is use-
less to try further. They are “vic-
tims” in the sense that they have
been transformed from sensitive,
curious, creative individuals into in-
sensitive, mentally fatigued cogs in
a machine which makes a lot of
noise but which is not really operat-
ing properly.

| would like to turn briefly to the
subject of education and develop-

ing a learning community. A learn-
ing community, as I see it, is one in
which all the participants, whether
they are young or old, faculty or
non-faculty, seek to learn from one
another. To make this happen, con-
ditions surrounding a community
must be conducive to openness and
personal growth and supportive of
the learning process.

munity should be able to be both a
giver and a receiver of information

Each member of the learning com-
and knowledge. Certain members of
the community have much to offer
in the way of expertise, scholarship,
and experience, and their role is ac-
cepted as important, However, the
flow of knowledge should not be a
one way movement,

It is believed that each participant
in a learning community should
share in the import and evaluation of
that community. The essentials of a
learning community are: a climate
for the honest airing of differences of
views and the expression of one’s
true feelings and reactions; two-way
communication and feedback; self
awareness and support for building
on the strengths of each individual.

If these assumptions are granted,
then there are many implications

LETTERS TO

O’Neal Blasts Tax
In Letter To EC,

The Ring-tum Phi
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

In view of the tacit complacency
exhibited by the Executive Commit-
tee concerning the city of Lexing-
ton’s adoption of compulsory city li-
cense tags for all car-owning stu-
dents, I ask the E.C. to issue a state-
ment of its feelings in order to in-
form the student body of its posi-
tion.
Seemingly, the two members of
the E.C. present at the adoption ac-
quiesced to the license tags so that
the issue of the property tax could
be dropped until a later, more strate-
gic date. Seemingly again, they
merely accepted the lesser of the
two evils. I find this acceptance
more in the spirit of resignation
rather than in that of demanding
compromise.

The City of Lexington’s economic
dependence upon the student body of
Washington and Lee is quite appar-
ent. What need does the city have
which necessitates further exploita-
tion of the students? The sale of city
license tags, even in practicality,
could not bring in enough revenue
for the city alone to adequately re-
pair not only its roads but also those
frequented by students to and from
their rural apartments. The city
limits of Lexington are confined to
a relatively small area when com-
pared with the miles of road leading
into the town from many students’
apartments,

Moreover, students’ cars do not
wear the city’s roads as much as the
large trucks which incessantly pass
through the middle of town. Truck-
ing companies rightfully must pay

Curriculum Committee

In May of this year there was an
overt display of activism never be-
fore matched at W&L. Now we are
back to school and it seems that a
considerable cooling down has oc-
curred during the summer. In some
respects this is good since the heated
emotions of last May hampered
clear thought for many. However,
the spirit of dynamism was good and
should not be allowed to slip away
while it can be used for constructive
ends.

The Curriculam Committee is
totally comprised of students and is
set up to deal with an important
area of student responsibility at
Washington and Lee. There are sev-
eral plans now under study by the
committee which we would like to
see enacted this year and which
would give to students more respon-
sibility and right to self-government,

One important plan is io set up a
teacher-course evaluation booklet
which would hopefully give the stu
dent body a more accurate view of
what a course is intended to do,
what the instructors’ approach is to
the course, and how well he accom-
plishes his plan. There will be in-
cluded in this booklet commenis
from students who have had the
course and the breakdown of the
grades given by the professor, lt is
obvious that this could prevent some
inequities that have occurred in the
past, as well as be a source of in-
formation.

Through this, students would have
a more knowledgeable baw for
course selection. Another aspect of

this is to set up a Student Course
and Grade Review Panel. This would
be a source of appeal to which the
students could carry complaints.
These sources of student informa-
tion and appeal would put the stu-
dents in a more advantageous bar-
gaining position when dealing with
problems encountered in academic
matters. This Board could be parti-
cularly beneficial with “I” grades
now completed. It is little secret that
some professors have emotionally
biased feelings toward those who
took “T's.”

Another source of student involve-
ment is the setting up of a liason
committee in every department com-
posed of students majoring in that
department. This committee would
sit in on all meetings of the depart-
ment as non-voting members. They
would have the ability in that posi-
tion to express student opinion on
issues concerning that department
and the majors. It is hoped that this
liason committee could have a hand
in interviewing prospective new
members of the department, setting
up mew courses. revising old ones,
setting requirements for majors and
generally assuming responsibility for
matters which directly concern them-
selves,

This type of liason committee has
already been started on a rudimen-
tary basis in the Sociology depart.
ment. As the number of majors has
grown it has become increasingly
necemary to make this committee
more formal and functional.

As has been seen in the experi-
mental stages, this type of commit
tee can be a beneficial source of in

formation, aid and innovation with-
in the department. It is an oppor-
tunity for students to have a greater
hand in regulating their own futures.
It is hoped that upperclassmen will
begin taking steps to set up this type
of liason committee within their de-
partments. It is also hoped that they
will meet with cooperation on the
part of the faculty. This can be an-
other important step in the develop.
ment and maturation of our educa-
tional system,

for the educational setting at Wash-
ington and Lee and at most other
institutions of higher learning. Ad-
mittedly, this concept of a learning
community just described presents a
model or ideal which may be impos-
sible to emulate fully.

However, the size and the setting
of Washington and Lee make me
hopeful that the improvements that
are needed can be made and that the
ideal is at least approachable. What
is needed is a re-thinking of what a
university should be and, conse-
quently, what the roles of the partici-
pants in that university should be,
whether they be faculty, administra-
tion, or students.

In my view, the relationship of
the participants should be one of
cooperation, Openness, and shared
concern in seeking to learn. If they
are practices which inhibit this type
of relationship it seems to me they
should be modified or laid aside. My
Observations are made not in an at-
tempt to pass judgment or censure,
but rather, from a feeling of concern
for this university and for those
bureaucrats whom I have mentioned.
The need to look at ourselves and
decide where we are going has
never been greater,

THE EDITOR

for the wakes left by their trucks,
Yet this money does not go directly
to Lexington for road improvement.
if Lexington wants so desperately
to improve its roads, it should justi-
fiably turn to the state to which the
money from taxes goes.

However, the city has already
shown its indifference towards road
improvement, by not even stipulat-
ing that the revenue from the sale of
tags would go towards road improve-
ment! I thoroughly question the City
of Lexington’s motives not only con-
cerning the license tax, but also con-
cerning the property tax. The stu-
dent-town relationship was previous-
ly favoring them disproportionately.
Students take from the town much
less than what the town reaps from
them. With the license tax and the
property tax, the City of Lexington
desires to swing the already askew
see-saw even more its way. Where
will this all end?

Without the support of the Execu-
tive Committee, any concerted fight
against these two taxes will flounder.
I urge you to adamately take a posi-
tion against both these taxes. Be-
cause the property tax is not as im-
minent as the license tax at this time,
I have not stated much of a case
against it. However, I believe that
both of the taxes can be dealt with
simultaneously. They both appear
inherently unjust to me.

Proposal:

That the Executive Committee
issue a statement of its convictions
and that this statement be formally
announced to all students by what-
ever means the Executive Commit-
tee choses.

That if the above statement is
favorable with what I have herein
expressed, that the Executive Com-
mittee stand by it and assume the
defense of the student body of Wash-
ington and Lee in the face of the ac-
tions of the City of Lexington con-
cerning the license tax and the pro-
perty tax.

That the Executive Committee
should immediately cali for a boy-
cott of the present license tax.

That students who have already
purchased City license tags be reim-
bursed by the City of Lexington.

That the Executive Committee call
a meeting with the City Council of
Lexington and state its case with a
clear preservation of its intentions
concerning the present license tax
and the pending property tax,

OCTOBER 14, 1970

 

BY GREG RAETZ

Now that the school year is under-
way and everyone has just about ac-
customed himself to classes beginn-
ing on a staggered schedule (start-
ing classes on the hour would have
been too simple), it is appropriate
once again to look at a question
which has been facing W&L for a
couple of years and which will,
hopefully, soon be answered. The
question is, of course, whether Wash-
ington and Lee should become co-
educational.

Much time and effort have been
consumed extolling the virtues of co-
education, but all too little have
been spent considering the problems
that would inevitably come with it.

Obviously the first problem that
arises is the economic cost of such
a move, and the fact is that to coedu-
cate W&L would be a very expen-
sive proposition. Even now dormi-
tory space is at a premium and the
addition of female students would
make it necessary to build more
dorms.

Expansion and/or remodeling
would also probably be necessary
for the dining hall and the gym. The
absolute costs of construction would
strain the W&L budget to say the
least, but the opportunity costs could
even be greater. How long would we
have to postpone the construction of
a new library, or the moving of the
Commerce School to its new build-
ing or any ofthe other improvements
which W&L needs to accommodate
properly its present enrollment.

Construction costs are not the
only economic problems which
would have to be solved. New fe-
male faculty members would have
to be recruited, hired and integrated

into the University. New funds for
scholarships would also have to be
obtained. W&L would have to seek
out new sources of income in order
to keep an endowment which would
allow it to remain competitive with
other schools in recruiting high qual-
ity students.

Furthermore, all of these changes
and additions would have to be
made without alienating alumni who
make a considerable contribution to
the solvency of the University each
year; and it seems likely that many
of the alumni would be bitterly alie-
nated by such a move. A man con-
tributes to something he knows and
believes in and as the institution
changes he has less in common with
it and his interest in it wanes. This
has been borne out by the experi-
ence of schools like Harvard who
have chosen to coeducate and it
doesn’t seem likely that Washington
and Lee would be an exception.
W&L would lose the support of
many once loyal alumni.

There are problems besides the
purely economic ones. Would a
change in the size of the University
adversely affect the student life?
Would it be necessary to fire some of
the instructors, e.g., in math and
the sciences, and add more in his-
tory and sociology? The changes
which these questions and others
like them imply are especially im-
portant because they involve chang-
ing the character of the University.

1 remember hearing or reading
somewhere that W&L offered a uni-
que educational experience; and |
have found that it does. Change is
inevitable, but the path to improve-
ment and achievement is not always
the most trodden one.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Markings.

BY BOB BAROODY

The pathological insanity of the
Nixon administration is once again
being exposed to the public view.
The occasion is, of course, the eve
of the November elections; no bet-
ter time to rally the nation against
that menace to human decency .. .
us. The problem is that, thus far,
students haven’t done anything. No
strikes, no bombings, no Kent States.
Some students actually watch foot-
ball games in October. To a sensible
person it would appear that Nixon
and his crew are wasting their
breath, We can’t even accuse the
president of overreacting; there is
simply nothing to react to,

Unfortunately, the above analysis
fails to acknowledge the fact that
when a man has been a politician
for nearly twenty-five years of his
life, he does not act as rationally as
some would wish. To perpetuate
yourself in power you need to be
crafty. You must be willing to sub-
vert reasonable thoughts to what a
social scientist might call a “game
mentality.” Richard Nixon, political
creature that he is, delights in play-
ing games. Consider his record:
everyone is familiar with “The Road
to Indochina;” some prefer “South-
ern Sweepstakes,” the fun domestic
game; and who can forget the built-
in thrills of “Middle East Show-
down?” Move the Sixth Fleet three
(free) world-squares and see what
the Russians do .

And now it’s time to play “Camp-
us Chaos.” The object of this game
is to incite and foment a student riot
through the use of the most offen-
sive tactics ever to be seen in this
country. To be considered a success,
this scheme must produce violence.

 

The Name Of The Game...

The president will then shift his at-
tention to something else: “Back-
lash,” a game of repression.

Thus, it is not difficult to under-
stand the rationale behind Nixon's
dark warning on the tube last month.
To underscore his point, Nixon sent
a ridiculous “Reader’s Digest” re-
print to university presidents: then,
in a most alarming gesture, he cried
to Congress for 1000 (more) FBI
agents to patrol our campuses. Spiro
Agnew typically hit the low road,
sputtering the alliterative asininities
spoon-fed to him by Nixon’s own
corps of  speechwriters. Agnew
would be a very funny person if he
were still a PTA president, but it so
happens that this madman can com-
mand first-page attention if he
sneezes. Most recently, as if “effete
snobs” were passing out of vogue,
John Mitchell added his great in-
sight; to the Attorney General we
are “those stupid bastards.”

All this is very heavy, It sounds
like a plot, and I believe Nixon's
student strategy to be exactly that.
But there is a way out; we don't
have to hear the administration or-
gasm, “I told you so!” Students can
refuse to play Nixon’s sick game and
walk with the dice. In doing so, we
can only help the several candidates
who have yet the sense to veto the
president's game plans. I am not so
deluded, however, as to suppose that
if we ignore these people the prob-
lems will disappear.

A plea. For the time being, let us
seek outlets other than violence for
these frustrations. The obvious, if
not ideal, alternatives are: (1) drugs,
(2) the World Series, and (3) your
own Candy Bergen. Pick your poi-
son and say “thank you Richard
Nixon,” we'll see you on the fourth.

Freshman Football Cancelled

BY PALMER TRICE

Freshman football made a differ-
ent appearance at W&L this year.
Those who chose not to participate
on the intercollegiate level were di-
vided into nine teams. For the last
two weeks, we have been able to
participate in action-packed contests
in which we were pitted man against
man, dorm section against dorm
section. The thrill of agony, and
the victory of defeat were ours for
the taking. We of the Old dorm’s
Oilers can hold our heads high and
claim that we were, perhaps the best.
Our record was 3-0,

The Oilers were—and remain—
a motley crew. We had everything—
from speed to lack of speed and size
to pint-size. Just like the pros, we
even had injuries. One of our stars
(of course, we were all stars), suf-
fered a sprained knee in our first
outing, but returned a week later for
our third game. Cases of devotion
to the game, such as this, were seea
frequently, on all teams.

The teams were usually fairly

even, making the games fun for all,
win or lose. All teams had their pro-
blems. Some could not find a leader.
Others were unable to round up
eight players. The Oilers had the
leader, but frequently lacked the
players. In our first two games, we
were forced to play five on five.
Everyone enjoyed the competition
and the exercise. But while we were
mustering five, some dorm sections
were unable to draft any stars. This
resulted in many forfeits, and the
defeat of the purpose of the pro-
gram—which was to give those non-
varsity competitors a chance to play.
Each team was made up of three
dorm sections, They were coached
by one of the dorm counselors, in
our case by Mr. Rob Turnbull. Rob,
or “Coach” to us, was a constant in-
spiration to all of us. His limitless
knowledge of the game, his devotion
to the team, and his soul-moving
halftime pep talks made a bunch of
potential great stars into, not a great
team, but a bunch of great stars.

season to an abrupt finale last week,
we had finally began to collect the
required number for a legal team.
Interest appeared to be growing,
instead of waning. There were of
course many problems with the pro-
gram.

Many students who would like to
play have classes at game time. Labs
tend to put one on the disabled list
for the afternoon. Also, some felt
that they lacked the time this early
in the year. They had to get used to
the system. Some of us who lack the
talent for intercollegiate competi-
tion, but love to play, will play any-
time. There should be a program for
us, and for those who would like to
play with us,

Surely the athletic department
could find us a time and a place to
play. Make the program voluntary,
and place it in a convenient time
slot. A meeting of those that wished
to play could decide such a time.
The purpose of the freshman intra-
mural program was good. Don’t let
it die.

W&L Lacrosse
Ranked 17th

WA&L's lacrosse team ranks 17th
in the country in pre-season rankings
announced today.

Coach Dick Szlasa’s Generals post-
ed an 8-3 record last year, their best
in the school’s history, and just miss-
ed taking the South Atlantic division
championship, losing an 8-7 heart-
breaker to champion North Caro-
lina.

Most of that young team returns
for Coach Szlasa this spring, and
will be joined by a bevy of talented
youngsters among the freshman
class.

The rankings were announced by
“The Lacrosse Newsletter,” the
“bible” of intercollegiate lacrosse.
Last year's national tri-champions,
Virginia, Navy and Johns Hopkins,
are ranked No. 1. Others in the top
ten, in order, are Army, Cornell,
Maryland, North Carolina, Brown
and Yale.

Washington and Lee was ranked
43rd in the national rankings last
year. There are a total of 160 col-
leges now playing lacrosse.

it a favorite among multitudes across
the nation, particularly in Cincinnati.

As most people realize, the Big
Red Machine is not a new model on
display at Woody's or Newcomer’s,
but the Cincinnati Red National
Baseball Club, Inc. Despite the fact
that the Reds have developed engine
problems lately, their American Lea-
gue counterparts for the 1970 World
Series, the Baltimore Orioles, should
by no means be preparing any vic-
tory speeches yet. And although the
Reds did not look like the same ter-
rors of the past season in the first
two games of the October Classic,
they are just too good a team to go
down four straight.

On the basis of the past weekend's
action, the opening Red losses can
be attributed to bad luck in Game
One, and bad pitching in Game Two.
It has been alleged that when Plate
Umpire Ken Burkhart was a Na-
tional League pitcher back in the
40's, the bullpen catchers caught
him ‘bare-handed. Saturday Burk-
hart proved he is as bad an umpire
as he was a pitcher when he com-
mitted what will undoubtedly go
down as one of the biggest no-no’s
in the history of the national pas-
time. Burkhart made two mistakes;
he blocked Baltimore’s Ellie Hend-
ricks from applying what looked to
be a close play at the plate, and
then called the Red’s baserunner
Bernie Carbo out as he slid past
Hendrick’s outstretched arms. Car-
bo represented the tying run in the
4-3 duel won by Baltimore, and the
ruling prevented an extra-inning con-
test and possibly a different outcome.

But bad breaks are part of the
game, and the Orioles might just as
easily have been the victims. How
ever, Burkhart’s blunder suggests
that perhaps the umpires should
think twice before striking soon for
more pay.

The lack of good relief hurling
killed the Reds in the next game as
Baltimore surged from behind to
win 6-5.

The Reds may be down but should
not be considered out of the money.

Rugby team scrums Hampden-Sydney in 18-14 win last Sunday.

Ruggers Stomp H-S, 18-14

Washington and Lee rugby team
evened its record this week as they
banged out an 18-14 win over stub-
born Hampden-Sydney.

The Generals jumped out to an
early lead when Bob Deaderick fell
on a loose ball in the Hampden-
Sydney end zone and Fred Fletcher
converted the kick to give the rug-
gers a 5-0 lead. Chip Henry later
rolled his way into the end zone with
one minute left in the first half and
raised the score to 13-0.

Early in the second half W&L was
left two men short because of in-
juries and Hampden-Sydney roared
to within two points. However, with

 

cinnati can break a close game wide
open, and their overall pitching
strength ought to rule out the pos-
sibilities of a four-game sweep by
the American Leaguers, On the other
hand, the Orioles have quickly
stacked themselves to a two-game
lead, and have become the hosts for
games three and four.

By the time this article is in your
hands, Spiro Agnew may be doing
handstands in front of Memorial Sta-
dium after the Orioles win Game
Four, but I prefer a longer Series
and predict Baltimore in six or
seven.

H-S; Too Big, Too Fast

By Pete Jones

The Washington and Lee Generals
put together their best mixture of of-
fense and defense thus far this year
but failed to come up with turnovers
as they lost the Homecoming contest
19-0 to Hampden-Sydney.

Turning out for the game was a
crowd of over 3,000, including an
abundance of W&L alumni. The
Generals came to conquer; they
took to the offensive right away, but
the big play eluded their grasp.

Immediately upon receiving the
opening kickoff, the Generals, led by
Steve Fluharty, churned out steady
progress from their own 37 yard-
line, with the help of a pass comple-
tion to Frank Stearns and a penalty.
But on third down and long yardage,
a blitz by Tiger linebacks caught
Fluharty behind the line of scrim-
mage. Fluharty fumbled on the W&L
45 yardline, a play from which
Blue morale never recovered.

Hampden-Sydney later forced
W&L to punt from their own four
and swept down the sidelines to re-
turn the ball to the W&L ten. Three
brilliant defensive stands went to
waste when, on fourth and goal from
the five, the Hampden-Sydney split
end caught a touchdown pass for the
first score of the game. After the
conversion, the score stood 7-0 with
6:23 left in the first quarter.

The remainder of the quarter ran
out to the tune of three plays and a
punt by both sides. As the second
quarter opened however, Hampden-
Sydney put together its longest ball-
control drive of the game, 68 yards,
helped along the way by a personal
foul call against W&L.

After three attempts to score from
two yards out were thwarted by a
brilliant General goalline stand, the
H-S running back broke the line on
fourth down and darted 1% inches

to score with 5:15 left in the half.
The extra-point kick went wide and
the half closed with a 13-0 score.

The defense dominated the third
quarter as twice the Generals stopped
dangerous threats. Hampden-Sydney
penetrated to the W&L 14 yardline
midway in the quarter and had to
cough the ball up on downs.

Even though Hampden-Sydney re-
covered the ball on the very next
play on a fumble, an interception by
Jim Allen ended the challenge. With
only a minute remaining in the third
quarter, Hampden-Sydney began to
roll after receiving a Blue punt on
the W&L 47 yardline. An eight

Virginia Tops
Generals 7-0

BY DAVE TORRANCE

The Washington and Lee soccer
team suffered a bad loss on Sunday
when the University of Virginia
blanked the Generals 7-0. Led by
Jay Connor, who made three goals,
during the game, U.Va. commanded
the game at the half 5-0. Although
the Generals kept the Cavaliers
scoreless in the third quarter, U.Va.
got two more goals in the last period.

Virginia is certainly a different
team this year from the club that
barely squeaked by W&L last year
2-1. This year U.Va. could be the
best team in the state. They out-
passed and out-guessed the Generals
with a form that has been rarely
seen in teams W&L has faced so far
this season.

Perhaps W&L’s problem is its in-
experience; 75 percent of its players
are sophomores and freshmen. The
team’s inexperience is reflected in
its problems with depth and passing.
U.Va. had two squads of players
which they rotated every 10 min
utes last Sunday, while the Generals
had to employ basically one team
throughout the game. The Generals
passing was poor at certain points
in the contest; no doubt this can be
attributed to the team’s inexperience
in playing together.

The Generals have a tough sche-
dule ahead. A consistently hard-
nosed Roanoke College squad will
tangle with the Minks this Saturday,
and in weeks to come the Blue will
play Jacksonville, the fifth-ranked
soccer team in the nation. Undoubt-
edly, the Generals will not be short
on challenges during the rest of the
season. And at the season's close,
they shouldn't be short on experi-
ence, either.

Right now hundreds of Americans are
being held captive in North Vietnam.

A few prisoners have made it back. They
talk about bamboo cages. Vicious beatings.
Malnutrition. Humiliation.

But the North Vietnamese will tell us
nothing. And it’s this silence that makes our
appeal more urgent.

For the families at home, there is no
word on who’s alive. Who’s dead. Or even
who's being held. There is nothing. Except
the anguish of not knowing.

Maybe you can ome this. By writing
to the one man who can change it: The Presi-
dent of North Vietnam.

Ask him to release the names of prison-
ers, allow them to write to their families,
and let the Red Cross inspect the prisons to

J. N. Thomas
Named Rector
Of The Board

The election of the Rev. John
Newton Thomas of Richmond, Va.,
as rector of the board of trustees
was announced today.

Dr. Thomas, a board member
since 1938, succeeds Dr. Huston St.
Olair of Surfside, Fla., rector for
the past five years. Dr. St. Clair will
remain as a member of the board.

The new rector is professor of
systematic theology at the Union
Theological Seminary in Richmond.
He earned his bachelor of arts de-
gree from Washington and Lee in
1924, and holds the M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees from Edinburgh University
(Scotland). In addition, he is a
bachelor of divinity graduate of
Union Theological, and was award-
ed an honorary doctor of divinity
degree in 1943 by Hampden-Sydney
College.

He is also a trustee of Mary Bald-
win College in Staunton, and served
successively as pastor of the Second
Presbyterian Church in Richmond,
prior to beginning his teaching duties
at Union Theologiacal in 1940.

Dr. St. Clair, who was president
of the Virginia State Chamber of
Commerce between 1944 and 1946,
is a 1922 graduate of Washington
and Lee. He served as a member
of the board’s executive committee
and was one of the two members on
a special scholarship selection com-
mittee.

Also announced by the University
was the election of Christopher 1.
Chenery of New York City as a
trustee emeritus. A former chairman
of the board of the Southern Na-
tural Gas Co. and an executive of
several other utility interests, Mr.
Chenery had first been elected to
board membership in 1950, He is a
1909 graduate of Washington and
Lee.

His retirement from active serv-
ice as a trustee was due to poor
health, according to the board's an-
nouncement today. In a resolution
of appreciation, his fellow trustees
described him as “a leader of in-
tegrity, wisdom and foresight.”

“Throughout the 62 years that
have passed since he enrolled as a
student here,” the resolution said,
“the university family has looked
with admiration and pride upon his
achievements as an engineer, indus-
trialist, sportsman, and good citizen
of a nation he loved.”

In further action, Washington and
Lee's trustees adopted a memorial
resolution to Mrs. Alfred 1. duPont,
also a trustee, who died Sept. 26.

Mrs. duPont, the first woman
elected to board membership in the
university's 221-year history, was its
most prominent benefactor. She had
contributed some $7 million to

EC Rules On Exam Schedule;
Law Elections On Monday

The Executive Committee voted
unanimously at its Monday meeting
to consider all independent exam
“hot.”

Senior Joe Tompkins brought up
the point that the faculty question-
ed a policy of keeping term exams
cold. He proposed that the current
EC recommendation of cold tests
remain in effect throughout the year
except for term exams during the
independent exam period. All term
exams will be hot until the end of
the examination period.

Law representative Jim Slay an-
nounced that the Law School elec-
tions will be held Monday, Octo-
ber 26 at 10:00 a.m. in the South
Room of Tucker Hall. The Fresh-
man Law Officers and Executive
Committee representative will be
selected.

Bill Millkey reported to the EC
wbout the Film Committee. He ex-
olained that the main problem con
cerning the committee is difficulty in
finding a place to show films rather
than the procurement of the films
themselves. In the past year the
committee has shown films in six
hocations, but none of the sites is
permanently available for the com-
mittee’s use. The Student Center
lacks space and proper projection
equipment for an adequate showing.

Bill Merrill and Mark McMinn
were recommended to head the Film
Committee by Bill Millkey. The EC
unanimously approved these ap-
pointments,

JoJo Martin, Chairman of the
University Center-Orientation Com-
mittee, appeared before the EC. Jo-
Jo proposed that the EC accept a
statement of policy for use of the
Cockpit.

The statement of policy olaims
that an organization can use the
Cockpit only if the organization
does not limit the use of the Cockpit
by other students or interferes with

regular business in the tavern. Also
an organization must gain approval
from the entire University Orienta-
tion Committee before it can use the
Cockpit.

Glenn Azuma moved to accept
‘his statement of policy. There was
no discussion and the proposal pass-
ed unanimously. The EC also ap-
proved the appointment of Thorton
Hardy to the University Center-
Orientation Committee.

it was announced that there are
openings for freshmen on four Stand-
ing Committees. These committees
are: University Center-Orientation,
Financial Relations (formerly Cold
Cheek), Library, and Curriculum.
Interested freshmen should give a
letter to Rich Murray, Secretary of
the Executive Committee, explain-
ing their qualifications and recom-
mendations for the committee.

Vice President Phil Thompson re-
ported briefly on the Honor System
Study Committee. Phil explained
that all W&L students are asked to
fill out the questionnaires about the

Honor System before this Friday.
Questionnaires can be found in the
Co-op, in front of Washington Hall,
and in the Commons.

When all these questionnaires and
recommendations are returned, the
committee will study them. Any new
ideas and worthwhile suggestions
brought out by these questionnaires
will be discussed before the entire
EC.

Jim Slay also announced that he
had contacted the Legal Aide Re-
search Society. The group agreed to
study the legal aspects of the new
local car tag tax.

Joe Tompkins introduced a pro-
posal from an unnamed senior. The
proposal was that President Fran
Lawrence undergo psychotherapy
for 20 weeks as an aid in performing
his duties. Staman Ogilvie moved to
amend the proposal so that Law-
rence would also cut his hair. Both
the proposal and subsequent amend-
memt were soundly defeated.

All members of the Executive
Committee were present.

Yogi Expert To Lecture
At duPont Hall Thursday

Charles Donahue of the Students’
International Meditation Society
will speak on Thursday, October 22,
at 4:00 p.m. in duPomt Auditorium.
His subject will be transcendental
meditation as taught by Maharishi
Mahesh Yogi.

Ihis is a technique of meditation
for exceeding the conscious mind
and tapping the reservoir of creative
intelligence. According to the Medi-
tation Society, TM is an ancient
technique that is completely safe,
natural and spontaneous. It can be

Solomon Paintings & Original Graphics
Will Be Shown In duPont Art Gallery

Iwo very different yet equally en-
gaging exhibits will be on display at
the duPont Art Gallery during the
course of the week. The first, a set
of large paintings by Jack Solomon
of Commonwealth University in
Richmond, opened here last Thurs-
day. The second exhibition, consist-
ng of original graphics by classic
and contemporary artists, will be
presented in duPont for one day
only on Monday, October 26.

The Solomon paintings are repre-
semiative of the artist's latest work,
all the paintings having been com-
vleted during the past few months
especially for this show. The ten ab-
stracts were painted with liquitex on
canvas, and all are titled after stars,
from Algol to Regulus.

Each of the compositions, meas
uring seven feet by five-and-a-half
evolves from horizontal and
erid patterns with subile
modulations within the grid
squares. The canvases are “shaped,”
nol framed in the conventional rec
tangles, but rather in odd geometric
polygons. The coloring technique is
im the vein of “op art,” in which the

Dr. Doyon emphasized that the
etchings and lithographs on display
are originals by the artist's own
hand. “Each print is signed by the
artist and probably numbered,” he
said, “The more limited number of
prints executed by the artist, the
more expensive they will be. The
works with the lower numbers will
most likely be the more valuable,
since the first compositions will be
more fresh and precise.”

Mr. Dennis Martin of the Roten
Galleries will be on hand to answer
any questions regarding graphic art
and printmaking.

Dr. Doyon expressed his enthusi-
asm with future exhibits being en-

 

gaged for duPont Gallery. “We are
planning two shows a month and are
already arranging the exhibits three
years in advance.” He emphasized
also the variety which the shows
will be taking on. “In the past we
have been limited mainly to painting
and sculpture in the contemporary
idiom. Now we want to expand our
scope to include both the past and
the present, and at the same time to
become more international.”

He gave as an example a major
show of photography from Ger
many, scheduled to appear at WAI
in two years. The exhibit will in-

clude 522 photos from 32 countries
by 230 photographers. He also not-
ed that exhibits preceding Christmas
in future years will focus on crafts,

age, or religious convictions, and
the only pre-requisite is that a per-
son be off drugs for at least fifteen
days prior to initiation into actual
participation.

Persons involved in the course of-
fered by the SIMS meditate for 15
minutes each morning and evening.
During this period of meditation,
the Society claims, the entire sys-
tem receives a rest even more pro-
found than deep sleep. Tension and
stress are relieved and the meditator
rises feeling calmer, more energetic
and with a clearer mind. No advanc-
ed yoga positions are taught in the
course,

The transcendental technique had
reputedly been lost for centuries
when the Maharishi'’s Master recov-
ered it and revived the technique in
its purity. Now the method is avail-
able on a world-wide scale; the SIMS
has enrolled over 40,000 students
on over 300 campuses in the United
States alone.

Donahue will appear in the Cock-
pit at 8:00 p.m. Thursday night for

dents.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Of Bike Disasters, Happiness And France

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
OCTOBER 21, 1970

The “Town Vs. Gown” Turmoil

Dr. Wilfred J. Ritz, professor of law at W&L, made a very
funny comment on page 3B of the News-Gazette this past
October 14. Not many students are laughing about it because
they probably haven't read his letter to the editor of the News-
Gazette. Not many leaders in the City of Lexington are laugh-
ing about it because they certainly must have read it. No one
will laugh after reading what we have to say about it.

It appears to us that Dr. Ritz’s lengthy legal analysis of the
validity of students’ right to vote in local elections has inaugu-
rated another partially informed chapter in the continuing
story of Lexington’s own “Town vs. Gown” serial which be-
gan last year when the City Council announced that students
would be required to purchase tags for their motor vehicles.

For some time, we, along with Dr. Ritz and others, con-
sidered the tag requirement to be a tax upon students vehicles.
According to City Manager Guy Agnor, this fee for the tag is
not officially regarded as a tax; rather it is considered as a
“usage fee” which students must pay if they have an automo-
bile. The theory behind this fee is that students ought to
share in supporting the maintenance of the streets in Lexing-
ton since they use them as much as permanent residents. It is
not a property tax. (The property tax on cars within the city
limits is presently $4.40 per $100 valuation.)

This toll for the maintenance of the streets of the city has
nothing and everything to do with Dr. Ritz’s revelation that
students are at present able to register as qualified voters in
Lexington. The fee has nothing to do with the voting issue be-
cause any student could elect to claim over six months’ resi-
dency within the city limits and therefore register to vote in
Lexington elections whether he owned an automobile or not ;
Dr. Ritz made this point clear in his letter of October 14.

What Dr. Ritz did not mention was the small matter of real
and personal property taxes, a property tax on one’s car and
Virginia state income tax which a student would have to pay
if he were registered to vote in Lexington. We imagine the
Lexington City Council has chosen not to tax student's per-
sonal property because of the enormous expense that each stu-
dent would face in meeting tax requirements just in order to
vote in city elections.

Sut perhaps our imagination is a little too wild. Consider
for a moment the enormous revenue the city would accrue
from a property tax levied on the real and personal property
of students. And the state of Virginia wouldn’t mind a little
extra money by way of income tax on W&L and VMI stu-
dents. Spending a little money on a city license tag fee (not
property tax) is not such a bad idea when we consider that so
far at least the city has no plans to place property taxes on
students. And as City Manager Agnor explained, the money
from the fee goes into a general fund and is transferred directly
to a road maintenance budget which is prepared by the City
Manager each year. So, the way it stands now, a student can
elect to pay property taxes by registering to vote.

But were the City Council to decide to place property taxes
upon students residing in this city, they would give the stu-
dents no choice: register to vote or be caught by their own
lassitude in the old familiar situation of “taxation without
representation.” We trust the City Council will not attempt
to rip the lid off of Pandora's box by instituting property taxes
upon students.

Six Paragraphs Of Levity

Every so often we run across bits of humor about our camp-
us which strike us as significant enough material to pass along
to our readers. By simply relating these rib-tickling anec-
dotes or chuckle-provoking vignettes, we hope that our read-
ers will realize the intense comedy of human affairs, and the
sheer buffoonery of all human endeavor, Or of most human en-
deavor.

Take for instance the Executive Committee meeting Mon-
day night. Normally the leaders of student government at this
institution are intensely organized, highly efficient, and ex-
tremely business-like in all their affairs; yet this past Monday
night a little touch of humanity was added to the regularly
strict decorum: the EC voted against a proposal to apportion
unlimited funds in order to commit president Fran Lawrence
for 20 weeks of psychiatric treatment,

\pologizing to the press for the momentary break from
tense grappling with pressing issues was vice president Phil
Thompson, who termed the intermission “10 minutes of le-
vity.” And it was that.

We feel now that we ourselves must swerve away from the
temptation of being completely humorous, for editorials
should be instructive and often opinionated, Therefore, we are
of the opinion that more students should take an interest in
their student government. We furthermore instruct you, our
readers. to attend an Executive Committee meeting in the near
future. It would be well worth the while of every student to
experience at least once the astounding speed and organiza-
tion with which each meeting is conducted, as well as the clar-
ity of every decision the EC makes

All seriousness aside, though, we can't help but concur with
Fran Lawrence's two comments which concluded the witty
melee: “I've never had such a good time in my life,” and “I
don't see why we can’t run meetings informally.’

One comment which we can't understand was uttered by
secretary Rich Murray in reply to Mr. Lawrence's jibe that
meetings should be run more informally “We do.”

and Lee participants in the Sweet
Briar College Junior Year in France,
which included 99 students from 26
colleges and universities. Members
of the group, after an intensive six-
week program in Tours which in-
cluded courses in the French langu-
age and culture, spent the academic
year in Paris, at the Universite de
Paris and affiliated institutions.
Members of the group traveled in-
dependently during vacation periods.)

Happiness is directing a native of
Bordeaux from Notre Dame to the
Arc de Triomphe. Happiness is un-
derstanding his language. And hap-
piness is, I believe, the capacity to
understand him at least a little bet-
ter than your compatriot, the Ameri-
can tourist. Happiness is the feeling
of wind in your hair—whether on
the way up M. Eiffel’s celebrated
tour or on the Autoroute du Sud on
a weekend hitch “home” to see
“your family” there. Happiness is
riding in the middle of a truck cab
whose driver stopped to pick up
your girl, now huddled in the corner.
And, yes, happiness is that cold
Paris rain.

I find inspiration in the thought
that dear Madame will soon be pour-
ing sparkling Vichy water (coupled
with a bite of that old French cure-
all, ham) down the mouth of another
sick but unwilling American stu-
dent. Monsieur still worries about
his liver. Cheeses are still sold on
rue Marbeuf, flowers on Ile de la
Cite, and traveler's checks on Ave-
nue Scribe.

The hordes of
American and
European tourists

The

whose annual in- Junior
vasion of France
begins in early Year
June have for Abroad
the most part

gone home by September 16, our
landing date. The Cunard pier was
thus relatively uncrowded as the
Sweet Briar group prepared to meet
its first member of the French bur-
eaucracy, an unsmiling fonctionnaire
of the customs service. Having clear-
ed customs, our people were ready
to encounter a second aspect of
French life—the labor strike. Four
funny little French buses were wait-
ing to take us to Tours, on account
of a national railway strike. I was
to remenrber this introduction to
France on many occasions—as I ate
breadless sandwiches due to a bak-
ers’ strike, sat in Orly waiting for
my parents’ flight to unload during
a ground crew strike, or sat watching
a performance in an Opera lit only
iby candlelight during an electrical
workers’ strike (and this a month
after the scheduled performance
date due to a singers’ strike!). Mem-
bers of the Sweet Briar group would
spend hours in a city choked by
metro strikes and dirtied by a gigan-
tic garbage collectors’ strike.

On the bus, those of us sober and/
or awake enough to care remarked
upon the French houses, French
cows, French grass and French girls
we passed as the bus radio blared
out old Beatles songs. We spent the
night in a French hotel in the French
town of Caaen, surrounded by
French medieval ruins in which, to
my regret, | soon became lost in
the French coffee in a cafe, and I
suppose | would thus have to say
that my first night in Caaen was
one of my most memorable. Next
day, on the way to Tours, we visited
the cathedral of Le Mans, one of
France's most beautiful (“So you've
seen your first cathedral.” my
French4eacher aunt would cynically
write.) In Tours we were introduced
to our French families, and the dis-
may of Madame was evident when
she heard my first words of French.
My first were to be my last for an
entire day, until | decided that a
year punctuated only by an accasion-
al “oui” would be too much for even
me to handle.

Those beautiful fall days seem in
retrospect perhaps the mosi mean-
ingful of the year, at least for me.
My family was blessed with a son
and two lovely daughters, and a
mother who loved to cook. Even
now when | think of France I think
first of them. Reflecting on those
days in Tours brings to mind a maze
of memories of picnics with friends
along the Loire, or of our delight
ful conversation classes held in cafes
with young Frenchmen our age

wround a beautiful square in the cen
ter of the city. One is Communist,
one is Socialist, and one is Guallist

bread, and a bottle of wine—and off
wed gO, sometimes leaving af 7:00
to get those first 20 kilometers be

hind us before the heavy traffic be-
gan. In this way I saw some 18 cha-
teaux—not hurriedly as an Ameri-
can tourist would do, but one or two
at a time—and ate picnics on some
f the most beautiful lawns and
ruins in Europe. In the process, I
also acquired a considerable interest
in French history, without even aud-
iting History 363.

Berthenay—it could have been
any of a million French hamlets—a
handful of little houses, a decaying
church, and of course a cafe. Yet it
was in Berthenay that my room-
mate, our dates and I realized that
somehow we'd missed that turnoff to
Azay-le-Rideau some 20 kilometers
back. The solution? After an hour in
the cafe, and having posed for pic-
tures by the town’s one highway
sign, we retraced our tread marks.
But—the day was still young and,
shortly after our picnic lunch (eaten
this time in a deserted wine cave), I
veered my bike a little too far to the
left and—wham! There I was, flat
on my back, with a Bryn Mawr girl
on top. Carrying the bike 5 kilo-
meters for repairs was no fun. Yet,
of all my memories, this day was to
‘be the most cherished.

Paris, a French friend in Tours
once told me, is like Tours—only in
Paris the cars don’t stop for cyclists.
So it was that, in late October, Sweet
Briar arrived in Panis. Happiness, I
assure you, is your first sight of the
Tour Eiffel. Meeting the new family
in Reid Hall, the American center,
my French once again rose to the
occasion. Oh, well. I was to live four
blocks from the Champs-Elysses and
two from the Avenue George V. All
the sights I had seen until now—Mi.
St. Michel, Chenonceau, Amboise,
and the cathedral of Chartres—fad-
ed as we whisked by the Place de la
Concorde on our way home. Two
hours later, my roommate and I
were on the streets. We covered
Paris that night—on foot and in the
rain, two factors which would be
proved significant by the passage of
time.

Paris is so many things to so
many people that it would seem pre-
sumptuous for me to babble off per-
sonal inypressions. Paris is art, music,
poetry, dancing, and beauty. Paris is
also metro strikes, traffic jams, and
a cold, driving rain. Paris is a city of
incomparable beauty. It is the city of
the Louvre, of the Place des Vosges,

and of those famous caves and bis-

troes. Paris is the city of Napoleon,
Louis Philippe, and deGaulle. Paris
is Hitler dancing a jig, or brooding
alone early one morning in an empty
Comedie Francaise. For me there
are two proofs of Hitler's insanity.
One is his treatment of the Jews.
The second is his plan to destroy the
city of Paris. Paris is also Benjamin
Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, Vol-
taire and Diderot, Cocteau and Sar-
tre. Many of the world’s greatest
thoughts and philosophies, paintings
and compositions, had their start in
Paris.

Paris is also, as we were to dis-
cover, a city of students. At the Sor-

bonne, at Sciences-Po, in the student
cafes, in the cheaper restaurants,
were students of every nationality.
The Universite de Paris is the big-
gest conglomeration of schools and
institutes in France, claiming some
20,000 English majors alone. And
the French university system ‘is, I as-
sure you, French logic and organiza-
tion at its most absurd.

Grades on the year’s work for
those lucky enough to gain accep-
tance into the University are deter-
mined by one 15 minute oral exam
per course, and anything goes com-
me question, Most American stu-
dents complained of a system in
which creative thinking is actually
discouraged. In ithe course of the
year, each student had several ex-
poses, or oral reports, to deliver be-
fore each class.

 

What was said was unimportant:
students were graded on their ability
to speak neither more nor less than
10 minutes, and on their subject di-
visions, Each expose was expected to
have two central points, two sub-
points, under the central ones, and
two sub-subpoints under each of
vhese. Time allowed for each of
these was expected to be the same.
Foreign students, like their French
friends before them, soon learned to
beat his system. Sweet Briar stu-
dents came home enriched in many
ways. Few of them, I believe, came
back with a preference for the
French university.

1 for one found consolation for

my distaste of the French university
system in my professors, all of
whom are internationally known
political scientists. And few people
have the opportunity to study French
are not from slides but face-to-face
in the Louvre. I read few french
plays; | saw them. And the cafes,
museums, bookstores, and Paris in
general provided personal academic
stimuli for American students where
formal academic studies might not
have sufficed. And, overall, the most
important factor of our experience
as I see it was the opportunities it
provided of entering into a people
and a culture at least partially differ-
ent from our own, Many sacred cows
lie buried, then, in Paris,

During vacation periods and over
several week-ends, I traveled to
other parts of Europe, and ‘to the

“rench Riviera. Yet I can truly say
that I was never sorry or disappoint-
ed to return home to Paris. Rainy
days melted into rainy days for me
as they had for Francois Villon,
Voltaire, Moliere and Monet —
though this thought did not occur to
me until much later.

Paris represents much of that
which is right—and wrong—with
the world. For me, it will always
represent something very fine. Per-
haps my friend was more right than
he knew when he toasted Paris at a
farewell party our last night there—
“During 8 months we have been a
part of Paris. And Paris, in her turn,
has become a part of us.”

New York and Sweetwater Make Profit;
Dance Board Has A Healthier Budget

BY ROY CARLTON

An overwhelming response to the
University Dance Board's first con-
cert of the season has cased con-
siderably the Board's woes of earlier
in the year, Ticket sales at the door
and for the week preceding the con-
cert were the greatest in memory,
and, if the trend continues, should
salvage the year. Projecting a mini-
mum of ticket sales for future con-
certs, the Board is now able to make
some concrete plans for future con-
certs.

Response to the New York Rock
Ensemble-—Sweetwater concert was
tremendous, Although the Board
has only sold 450 Dance Plans prior
to the week of the concert, revenues
from additional Dance Plan and
ticket sales approached $2500 dur-
ing that week. An additional 200
tickets were sold at the door. The re-
sult was a VMI Pield House capa-
city crowd,

The audience wasn't disappointed
either, Despite technical problems
(not acoustical) between shows, both
New York and Sweetwater drove
the audience into a frenzy. In faci,
when New York came onstage, near
ly a third of the audience defyed the
cordons and moved onto the center
of the gym floor wirrounding the
stage. After a great deal of coercion
by concert officials and even New
York, the crowd was finally moved
off the floor

As of this writing, the Dance
Board stil has some $14,000 with
which to finance four more con
certs in addition to Charlie Byrd on
November 13. This is not taking into
consideration door sales which may
he expected to boost revenues con
wderably. Nev ertheless

withoul any

reliable estimate of how much this
added income will amount to, te
Board is still in a compromising s-
uation. A big help would be increas-
ed Dance Plan sales. The plans are
now being offered at a reduced price
of $35 which still represents a sav
ings over individual tickets with five
more concerts projected.

Current Dance Board plans cail
for some four concerts in the secon!
semester and short term, There will
be a January concert, a March con
cert and an April concert. Possibly
one of these weekends will be two

nights of concerts, or there will be a
<sparate weekend for the fourth con
cert. Definite dates have not been
chosen so as to afford the oBard
maximum latitude in contracting en
tertainment.

Currently under consideration are
John Sebastian, the Allman Brothers
Band, Neil Young, li's A Beauti
ful Day, Sha-na-na and Poco. The
proposed James Taylor concert has
once more fallen through following
another hike in his fee, When Tay-
lor aws first sought, last May, his

BY ROBERT BAROODY

Once again, right on schedule, the
Washington and Lee Mock Conven-
tion is drifting into newsprint. Tra-
ditionally, the Mock Convention was
The Great Event shared in common
‘by several generations of W&L men;
today it would be a ridiculous and
pathetic anachronism, Without sen-
timental pause, the 1972 edition of
the Mock Convention should be im-
mediately cancelled.

I make this proposal in full knowl-
edge that past Mock Conventions,
from William Jennings Bryan to
Richard Milhous Nixon, have often
assumed a national importance of
their own. Let us now have the fore-
sight to abandon what has become
an obstinate and oppressive habit;
moreover, What would be a waste of
our time, money, and energy.

Most students, never having ex-
perienced a Mock Convention, might
ibe curious to know just what they
would ‘be missing. Naive freshman
that I was, I left the 1968 event
with a distinct impression: that year’s
extravaganza was initially somewhat
amusing, but rapidly degenerated
into an exercise in boredom and bad
taste, Perhaps it would be a good
idea to poll members of the cur-
rent senior class concerning their in-
dividual impressions.

To state that the Mock Conven-
tion is ridiculous may not be reason
enough for its discontinuation. Those
desirous of something more substan-
tial may consider the following:

(1) The real Party Convention is
a political institution of the past;
it has been and is a travesty of the
democratic process. Equally damn-
ing is the fact that, Democratic or
Republican, the Party Convention
is specifically designed to neglect the

opinions of students and young vot-
ers. Who are we mocking but our-
selves?

(2) It costs too much. Finance Di-
rector Mike Miles claimed a budget
of $6,700 for the 1968 central com-
mittee. He also noted that state dele-
gations would spend an additional
$8,000 of their own money. No stu-
dent should be assessed for the rais-
ing of either of these sums.

(3) In the past, chairmen of the
Mock Convention have prided them-
selves on the authenticity of “their”
event. If simulation is the goal in
1972, are the organizers prepared to
extend an invitation to the National
Guard, authentically laden with gen-
uine canisters of CS gas?

(4) Is it so wonderful to mimic the
fifty-year-old, Order of the Moose
buffoons who cavort about in moro-
nic insensibility when called to the
task of determining our national
leaders? A Mock Convention gener-
ates and nurtures precisely the game
mentality that I referred to last
week. The transformation of “that
guy in my poly sci class” to a beady-
eyed power broker was an intriguing
sideshow of the 1968 exhibition.

Finally, I should have to admit
that notwithstanding these remarks,
the cancellation of next year’s con-
vention may already be an inevitabil-
ity. You, tahe Post-Ohicago genera-
tion, are far too sophisticated, bull-
proof to lend your support to such
a hopeless relic. In the past, the
Mock Convention served the pur-
pose of educating those who were
not yet acquainted with the filth of
political reality. Moratorium, Hunt-
ley - Brinkley - Cronkite, National
Guard, Yippies, Lobbies, Strike;
you've been there, let them find an-
other stooge.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

A Response To ‘‘Pulling

Out Of A Crash Dive”
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

While I appreciate your generous
evaluation of my stewardship of the
1968 Mock Republican National
Convention, in a recent editorial en-
titled “Pulling Out of a Crash Dive,”
I must take issue with you for the
sake of accuracy.

From material I have been receiv-
ing from the leaders of the 1972
Mock Convention, it seems to me
that the 1972 Mock Convention is
much farther along and much better
organized than we were at this point
three years ago. Mr. Silberberg has
methodically organized the work of
the 1972 Mock Convention in a way
which eluded us in preparing for the
last Mock Convention, and therefore
the invidious comparison suggested
in your editorial seems to me unfair.

What you call Mr. Silberberg’s
“chronic ‘begging syndrome”  oc-
curred many times before the 1968
convention as well. Because the Exe-
cutive Committee then was less co-
operative and less sensible of the im-
portance of the Mock Convention
than is the present committee, the
Mock Convention’s finances were
started by a personal loan taken out
at the Rockbridge National Bank by
the convention secretary, Jim Lowe,
and me.

Money given by the EC to the
Mock Convention is one of the best
investments that can be made for
Washington and Lee. Besides provid-
ing a rich and unusual exercise in
political gamesmanship, the Mock
Convention represents one of the
most potent public relations oppor-
tunities the university has.

I have been told by chairmen of
previous mock conventions, and have
found their opinion to be correct

from my own experience, that stu-
dent government support for the
convention has always been grudging
up until just before the convention.
This penury, which necessitates con-
vention chairmen “begging” for
money, is a false economy.

The Mock Convention deserves all
the support the EC can give it, es-
pecially when it’s being as well man-
aged as it is under Mr. Silberberg. I
recall all too vividly the charges of
inefficiency levelel at the Mock Con-
vention when I was chairman, al-
though—unlike Mr. Silberberg—I
had the estimate advantage of being
editor of The Ring-tum Phi. There
are better targets for editorials than
the Mock Convention.

Outlines Pass-Fail Plan

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

The following proposals concern-
ing Pass-Fail grades have been sub-
mitted to the Faculty Executive
Committee, the Faculty Curriculum
Committee, and the Student Body

The Committee proposes that:

1. Students wishing to take all
their courses on a Pass-Fail basis be
permitted to declare their intention
of doing so when they reach the be-
ginning of their junior year, or when
they declare their major, whichever
comes first.

2. Students be permitted to oper-

tirely of Pass-Fail courses or under
the current, applicable Pass-Fail reg-
ulations. (The Committee believes

BY GREG RAETZ

Undaunted by last year’s plebiscite
defeat, Student Body President Fran
Lawrence is pushing ahead with
plans for the fulfillment of one of
his campaign pledges — to change
the Honor System at Washington and
Lee.

Fortunately, however, it is the
student body which ultimately will
decide the fate of Mr. Lawrence's
project; and if they give it any
thought at all, they will soon realize
how unnecessary and ridiculous a
change in this area would be.

First of all, why are Mr. Law-
rence and the EC so worried about
the honor system? Do they know
something we don't know about the
Students attending or now entering
Washington and Lee? Do they some-
how feel that these students are more
prone to lie, cheat or steal? In other
words, don’t they have any faith in
the Now Generation?

The honor concept is not a tyr-
anny before which we cower every
day. The is that 99.9% of the
student body will have no contact
with the punitive aspects of the
honor system beyond witnessing the
mock trial at the beginning of the
freshman year. The honor code sim-
ply asks us to act as gentlemen. This
isn't very much to ask and the in-
junction isn’t very hard to follow.
Every incoming freshman knows this
one simple rule, and if he does not
think that he can adhere to this
minimum requirement of conduct,
he should not attend Washington and
Lee.

Of course there are those who will
say that extenuating circumstances
often exist and therefore make ex-
pulsion too harsh a penalty. | would
Suggest to them that “extenuating

circumstances” are few in number
and that I can think of none which
could excuse a student’s plagiarizing
a term paper or copying a class-
mate’s test.

In instances where there are doubts
or questions (all of us remember
how the mock trial came out) the
EC can acquit, and has acquitted,
the defendant, and rightly so. No
one wants to see an innocent or un-
wittingly guilty person thrown out of
school. Thus a method for dealing
with “extenuating circumstances”
has been built into the system.

The substitution of a year's sus-
pension for the so-called absolute
penalty is, I think, therefore an idle
proposal. An honor trial takes into
consideration all of the variables
and decides between guilt and in-
nocence. If the accused is innocent,
no more is said; but if he is guilty,
ihe is and should be asked to leave
the University—permanently. There
are too many men desiring to enter
W&L who are both academically
and ethically qualified to allow the
reinstatement of those who have
shown their contempt for gentle-
manly honor.

Basketballers Rebuild

BY PALMER TRICE

If one searches deep enough into
the depths of the sports pages, evi-
dence of the start of basketball sea-
son can be found. Such evidence
can also be found within the con-
fines of Doremus Gymnasium, as the
new season begins to unfold. Coach
Verne Canfield has a tough act to
follow. For the last four years, the
Generals have gone 75-24, a per-
centage of 68.8. Led by Mel Cart-
wright and Mike Neer, the Washing-
ton and Lee roundballers had the
best record of any team in the state.

Asked how he planned to replace
these two invaluable stars, Coach
Canfield replied, “We don’t replace
ballplayers like that.” This year’s
team will have a new look.

There are five returning letter-
men, including captain Mike Dan-
iel, who averaged about 15 points a
game last year as a sophomore. The
other veterans include Ellie Gut-
shall, Dave Stone, John Glace, and
Paul McClure. A welcomed addi-
tion to the squad is Charlie Strain, a
transfer from the University of
South Carolina. Charlie should pro-
vide a potent offensive punch. One
of the most promising freshman is
Skip Lichtfuss. He has made the
varsity squad. To compete with these
players are a “slew of sophomores.”
This makes for a team that is both
young and experienced. To make
sure that he has the best five, Coach
Canfield plans not to name his start-
ers until the last week of preseason
practice.

Due to the loss of two such noted
starters, Coach has changed both his
offensive and defensive systems. The
offense will be led by the point man.
This player will be the key to the
General attack. His movements will
reveal which of the options of the
attack that the other four should
take. These options are plays of a
sort, except that the players are not
bound by them. They may make ad-
justments when, and as often as the
situation demands. The basic offen-
sive set-ups will be the 1-4, the 1-3-1,
and the 1-2-2. The Generals will
run, but not often.

Defensively, the Generals will
show both a man for man and a
match defense. The match is a com-
bination of the man and the zone.
This defense brought W&L national

ranking two years ago. Daniel and
Co. plan to be very aggressive.
Among their tricks will be much
trapping. A multitude defensive sys-
tem will be used. During the course
of a game, several defenses will be
employed. Among their repertoire
will be the press.

The ballclub faces a tough sche-

dule, including Navy and Virginia.
The locations of away games ranges
from New York City for a weekend
to Florida for a tournament. Coach
Canfield feels that this year many
teams will be out to get us, after the
slim pickings of the past few sea-
sons.
Look for an exciting, determined
Washington and Lee team. Team
should be the watchword for this
year’s squad. They are a closely knit
bunch of boys. Coach Canfield calls
them “the most dedicated of all the
players” that he has coached. The
Opening game is on December 1 at
Doremus against the highly touted
Randolph-Macon Yellow Jackets.
The Yellow Jackets are the only
team that Coach Canfield’s round-
ball squads have never beaten. This
is the year.

Ruggers Over
Tarheels, 18-0

In a match completely dominated
by W&L, the Generals came up with
an easy 18-0 victory over the second-
string Tarheels of North Carolina.

W&L jumped out to an early lead
when Sandy Snead scooped up a
loose ball and ran five yards into the
Carolina end-zone. Fred Fletcher
followed with the conversion to
make the score 5-0. The next few
minutes passed with W&L constant-
ly threatening but unable to put the
points on the scoreboard. Finally
however with five minutes remain-
ing in the half, Bill Oast scored after
a loose scrum inside the UNC end
zone. Fletcher made the point after
thus hiking the score to 10-0.

In the second half, W&L con-
tinued to control the match. John
Griffith broke on a thirty yard dash
for an apparent score but was called
back for failure to ground the ball.

A few minutes later though Grif-
fith rammed over the goal line, and
after the kick the score was 15-0.
The game ended at 18-0 when
Tommy Baker burst over after tak-
ing a pass from Al GaNun,

Chris Murray and Hal St. Clair
had an excellent day offensively and
deserve special mention.

The Ruggers meet Lynchburg on
Sunday at 2:00 p.m. on the upper
field.

A familiar sight in recent weeks
has been a boy, loaded with a knap-
sack, and a girl, perhaps with a gui-
tar strung over her back, hiking into
the underbrush on what looks at
first glance to be a geological ex-
pedition or maybe a camera safari.

But in fact, it is only a Wa'shing-
ton and Lee student and his date in
search of a new way to have a week-
end of fun—camping. With the
warm weather of the past few weeks
and the woodsy surroundings, con-
ditions around Lexington have been
excellent for such jaunts.

Several of my friends have been
taking these sojourns into the wilds,
so with a little prodding from a fra-
ternity companion, I embarked on
my first encounter with the environ-
ment of Southwest Virginia. Hud
and I returned with our Hollins
dates and with a maximum of food
and a minimum of foresight and
planning, the four of us drove to the
Peaks of Otter campground up on
the Blue Ridge Parkway, just south-
east of Buena Vista.

What we found there made the
backyard of the fraternity house
seem more and more inviting. A
miniature township of campers had
erected their tents and unhitched
their trailers in preparation for a
night which we knew would be
chilly at best. Disappointed by the
hustle and bustle from which we had
sought to escape, we made our way
back towards the B.V. cutoff until
‘we approached a small resting place
off to the side of the Parkway. With
night coming on, and no one in
sight, we decided to choose Otter
Creek as our home for the next 18
hours.

We hurriedly pitched camp, build-
ing a small fireplace with the usual
necessary precautions, and went
about preparing supper. Boy Scout

Hud soon had a roaring blaze goin;
(which we later found out to be il
legal, since we were not in a camp
ground) on which we cooked ho
dogs. Hud also suffered mass lacera
tions when he tried to open the cat
of beans with a knife since we lack
ed a can opener,

Otter Creek provided us with ;
refrigerator in which we stashed ou
liquid refreshment. After  visitins
with a few of the local denizens
namely a box turtle and a couple o
raccoons, we crammed ourselevs in
to our sleeping bags (only two were
available for the four of us). Two tc
a bag was not too bad, but the fac
that the ground was slanted and in
credibly rocky did not lend to ar
exactly fitless sleep.

We half-consciously labored thro
ugh the night, plagued by crampec
quarters, the cold, and a_ blinding
moon, Having contemplated the
difficulties of the night before, we
bagged the idea of cooking break
fast, dutifully cleaned our campsite
and returned to Big Lex and the
comforts of home.

In retrospect, I immensely enjoy+
ed our little invasion of the hinter-
lands, but to be honest, it will be
a warm spring night before I do if
again,

Generals Break Losing Streak;
Top Tufts Jumbos In 35-34 Win

BY PETER JONES

The Washington and Lee Generals
opened their offensive steam valves,
charged ahead full speed into Tufts,
and emerged from the wild scoring
spree with their first vietory of the
season, 35-34.

Not only did the Generals score
more points in this game than they
had in their four previous games
combined, but they produced the
Small College Player of the Week
in Virginia, namely sophomore
quarterback Steve Fluharty. He com-
pleted 19 of 30 attempts for 307
yards, 15 of those completions to
end “Chief” Mahaffey for 256 yards.

The lead in the game changed

more times than a chameleon
changes color on a camuflaged suit;
a total of six times. Tufts began the
game determined to shame the Gen-
erals early by receiving the opening
kick-off and driving 61 yards in five
plays to score with only 3:30 gone
in the first quarter. After the con-
version, they led 7-0.

The Generals received the kick
and opened their offense on very
shaky legs. On their third play, Tufits
recovered a loose ball and quickly
converted a field goal of 27 yards to
raise their lead to 10-0 with 10:25
remaining in the quarter.

Upon again receiving the kick, the
Blue could this time do nothing

wrong. Three pass completions to
Mahaffey on third down situations
brought the ball down to the Tufts
12 yard line, from where JoJo Mar-
tin, who gained a total of 114 yards
rushing, scampered in with the first
W&L score with 6:33 still left in
the first quarter. Harris’ conversion
was good and the Generals were
back in the game, 10-7.

Again in possession of the ball,
Tufts rambled downfield until they
met tough opposition from Frank
Evans, Dave Brooks, George Harris
and Marshall Washburn on the
W&L 20. Another field goal at-
tempt, this from 37 yards out, was
good and Tufts vaulted its lead, 13-7.

Amazingly enough, the Generals
actually showed an explosive offense
on their next possession. In only
four plays, the big one a 50 yard
pass and run from Fluharty to Ma-
haffey, they tied the score and then
went ahead for the first time on
Harris’ conversion, 14-13, with 2:50
still left in the wild first quarter.

The lead was fleeting, though, as
Tufts again drove down to the W&L
20 with a first down. On fourth and
six, a Tufts halfback broke loose
and ran 16 yards to score, with
13:30 remaining in the half. The
two-point conversion run was good

deep into Tufits territory, to the 14
and the three yard lines, but both
time lack of downs killed the oppor-

inity to go ahead, The half ended
21-14, Tufits’ lead.

The third quarter had W&L stamp-
ed all over it. After fumbling away
on their own 27, the Generals dug in
and halted Tufts and their field goal
attempt; the turning point in the
game. On the next possession, Flu-
harty guided the Blue 80 yards, aid-
ed by two completions to Green
and one to Mahaffey, and scored
the touchdown himself on a 5 yard
run with 8:38 left in the quarter
Harris’ conversion tied the score at
21-21.

George Harris then recovered a
Tufts fumble afiter the kick-off and,
with Martin's gallop of 43 yards to
the Tufts two yard line, Fluharty
sneaked over, capping a 62 yard
drive, for his second T.D. and put
W&L in the lead again, 27-21. The
PAT kick failed.

Tufts managed to revive and come
back with a 53 yard drive, climaxed
by a two-yard sprint on the first
play of the fourth quarter. The con-
version sent Tufts back into the lead,
28-27.

Under pressure, Fluharty led his
team, with three completions to Ma-

 

Steve Mahaffey took this one for \a fifty yard pass reception and touch-

down.

On Girls, Winter

Have you ever wondered about athletics at a girls school?

 

It’s something you don’t really think about, but it’s a very im-
portant aspect of their education. Just like us, they have re-
quired P.E. and indulge in sports like swimming, tennis, bowi-
ing, badminton, and hockey.

Most girls take the sports far less seriously than the ad-
ministration, but there are those lovely lasses who live each
day to charge onto the field and join in combat.

As I see it, there are three types of girls who participate in
women’s athletics: the “jock,” the pretty young thing, and the
not-so-pretty young thing.

The “jock” is by far the most serious. You see her for the
most part on the sidelines huffing and puffing and discussing
game strategy. She’s always sweaty, her hair tied in a pig-
tail. She’s good, but a little too serious.

The pretty young thing is obviously my favorite. She's
normally so dainty that the slightest incident flusters her ter-
ribly. Being so intent is attractive for her; she knows it.

The not-so-pretty young thing tries the hardest on the field.
The athletic field is an outlet for her, and she loses her identity
there. That is good.

It's funny how you never hear about women’s intercollegi-
ate athletics. But it could be a great spectator idea. We should
take greater notice of it. Just think of tuning in on an NCAA
women's hockey game. Well maybe it wouldn't be that much,
but if you get a chance, go watch some girls compete.

Winter is right around the corner now and that means ski-
ing for many. There are two major ski areas around these
parts. Bryce Mountain and the Homestead offer decent skiing
at ridiculous prices. The Homestead is a nice place to visit but
is strictly a beginners slope. Like the golf courses, it is terribly
easy and offers little challenge. But it’s a great place to take a
date, a couple of bottles of wine and some French bread.

The more serious skier should go to Bryce Mountain, north
of Harrisonburg. Though small, it offers very good skiing for
these parts. Prices however are ridiculous, The only reason
able time to go is during the week when student rates becom:
at least $10. Well, it’s an expensive sport!

Goodnight Cur Ball; Please, Harry, go down the road!

Civilisation” Film Series
Set For 1971 Presentation

Dr. Allan Carlsson, president of
the Rockbridge Chapter of the Vir-
ginia Museum of Fine Arts has an-
nounced that the film series “Civili-
sation” has been obtained for show-
ing here.

“Civilisation” has met with criti-
cal praise and overflow audiences
wherever it has been shown. When
the National Gallery in Washington
premiered the series in this country,
“Gallery officials modestly hoped to
fill their 300 seat auditorium on
Sunday afternoon. The first after-
noon, 24,000 people showed up...”

Thus, though the films will not be
shown here until January, anyone in-
terested in seeing this excellent series
is urged to chaim their free tickets as
early as possible. This can be done
by contacting Dr. Allan Carlsson to
obtain a ticket request form.

 

At least 10 more volunteers are
needed to tutor in the Lexington
public schools. For particulars, see
either Professor Ray, Payne 32 B or
Professor Imeson in Howe 313.

price was a mere $5000. When the
board sought to contract him last
month for a January concert the
price was upped to $7500 and he
was booked up for January. Addi-
tional efforts were put forth by the
Board for a March concert, but be-
fore the contract for the tentative
date could be forwarded to him,
Taylor's fee rose to $11,000. With
only $14,000 in hand, and four con-
certs to go, the Board decided this
was too much. With only a limited
amount of space available at VMI
or Doremus, it was felt that the in-
creased number of ticket buyers
could not be accommodated.

NOTICE
Seniors planning to graduate in
June 1971 should complete an ap-
plication for degree before Novem-
ber 1. Application forms may be ob-
tained at the Registrar's Office. File

The Guess Who

7:30 P.M.

 

 

 

a
to North Vietnam.

Right now hundreds of Americans are
being held captive in North Vietnam.

A few prisoners have made it back. They
talk about bamboo cages. Vicious beatings.
Malnutrition. Humiliation.

But the North Vietnamese will tell us
nothing. And it’s this silence that makes our
appeal more urgent.

For the families at home, there is no
word on who’s alive. Who’s dead. Or even
who’s being held. There is nothing. Except
the anguish of not knowing.

Maybe you can —— this. By writing

tothe one man whocanc

ange it: The Presi-

dent of North Vietnam.

Ask him to release the names of prison-
ers, allow them to write to their families,
and let the Red Cross inspect the prisons to

 

insure proper medical treatment and living
conditions.
Remind him that he is bound by the

1949 Geneva Convention which his country

signed. And by the Istanbul resolution.

North Vietnamese leaders do care about
American public opinion. And if they think
they can gain something by bowing to it,
they will.

But one letter won’t do it. Or a thousand.
Maybe it will take millions. So we've got to
write now. All of us. And often.

Write a letter tonight. And send it to:
Office of the President, Democratic Repub-
lic of Vietnam, Hanoi, North Vietnam.

-—" cost youa quarter. But it might save
a life.

Large Turnout Expected During Parents’ Weekend;
Student Activity Forum To Highlight Innovations

BY SKIP PAUKERT

Well over 1,000 parents are ex-
pected to descend upon Lexington
this Friday and Saturday for the 16th
annual Parents’ Weekend.

Formal and informal visits with
faculty members, two home athletic
contests, campus tours, and a variety
of social events will be included

“Our major purpose will be to
allow parents to ask their questions
about the changes that have oc-
curred at Washington and Lee and
to explain why we're unique among
educational institutions,” said Mr.
Jerry Poudrier, assistant director of
development and coordinator of the
weekend,

On Friday afternoon from 3:30-
5:00 p.m., parenis may meet with a

udent panel led by Student Bo!)
President Fran Lawrence, designed,
says Mr. Poudrier, “to provide the
stimulating discussion afforded by a
small group and to allow parents to
get things off their chests.”

The success of last year's Friday
-vening dinner in the cockpit has led
to the establishment of a second

dinner on Saturday night. Dinner
will be followed by entertainment
ranging from the Sazeracs to folk
music and a magic show, all per-
formed by W&L students. Students
can make reservations for the din-
ner at $2.50 per person in the Uni-
versity Center.

Parents will begin registration at
10 a.m. Friday morning, and Mr.
Poudrier emphasized the importance
for parents to go to the Fairfax
Lounge in the Student Center to
register immediately upon their ar-
rival. At 2:30 Friday the Parents’
Advisory. Council will meet in the
University Center, and the R.O.T.C.
building will open its doors for an
open house.

The first athletic match of the
weekend will be the Varsity Soccer
game between W&L and William
and Mary on the upper athletic field
mi 3:15.

The McCormick Library will be
open and a tour from 4-5:00, will be
followed at 5:00 with the weekly
Chemistry Department seminar in
Howe Hall 401. Speeches by Chem-

Troubadours
To Present
‘Billy Budd’

“Billy Budd,” an adaptation of
Herman Melville's novel, will be
presented by the Troubadour Thea-
tre November 4-7. This play, written
by Coxe and Chapman, marks the
opening production of the Trowba-
dours’ 1970-71 season.

The basic thrust of the play, lke
Melville's novel, is the continuin:
struggle between good and evil.
Billy Budd, a young and handsome
stilor, is the perfect innocent; he
can see only the good in life. Bil)
even fails to recognize the evil in
John Claggart, the vicious Master-
at-Arms who personifies the wors!
side of man’s nature. Because of his
fury at Billy's lack of fear for him
Claggart accuses Billy of leading a
munity plot.

Billy has one weakness: he stam-
mers when he is nervous. When he
is confronied by Claggari’s untrue
accusation, Billy is unable to speak
up and defend himself. In his im-
potent fury, Billy strikes Claggart
and kills him.

Troubadour director Ellen Barnes
has altered the conclusion of the play
somewhat. The Coxe hapman work
ends with Billys hanging. Mfrs.
Barnes has added a final pantomime
scene in which the shep’s officers exit
and the crew resumes their duties.

With this ending, Mrs. Barnes
makes the point that, although good
and evil may contend against each
other, the basic monotony of life
goes on unaffected. This point is dis-
tinctly lacking in the Coxe and
Chapman original: it is, father, the
director's own interpretation

Although the theme of the play is
dark. and is perhaps made even more
so by the directors added conciu
sion, “Billy Budd” is not without
its momenis of humor, though ii too
form of Diack comedy. The
whole crew has scenes of erim hu
mor, while the priggshness of Gar
diner provides the crew as well as
the audience with moments of calm
in the harsh tone of the drama

Page 2 THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

October 28, 1970

A Unique Suggestion

“We must
retain the traditional
strengths that, over the years,
have made Washington and Lee
the institution .
that it is.”
—Dean Lewis G. John
Magazine of Washington and Lee
Winter, 1970

One of the “traditional strengths” which Washington and
Lee has offered students ever since the passing of General
Robert E. Lee is its student-administered Honor System, We
wonder whether at this time next year Dean John will be able
to write of the Honor System as a “traditional strength’ —ex-
cept in the past tense.

In the future the Honor System at Washington and Lee
may be no longer an attitude, a simple code of ethics held by
the students; it may become a handbook of about 50 pages of
rules and regulations outlining the skeletal structure of a fos-
silized straw horse which was beaten to death with the an-
guished cries of those who want a “break” for their “fellow
man.”

We find little grains of reasoning behind the odious sugges-
tion that those who have violated the gentlemanly code of con-
duct should be allowed to return to Washington and Lee after
a year’s probation, Does a year away from Lexington provide
the proper time span for an offender to realize that “W&L’s
Honor System was right; | was wrong; a gentleman does not
lie, cheat, or steal; henceforth I will live by the System; and
| will carry The Word back to the students of Washington and
Lee!”? Or perhaps those who would want to dilute the penalty
of expulsion with teardrops think that “ethics are a good thing
to have around and they make for a meaningful atmosphere in
a college environment, but... they can be a hang-up for a lot
of people.”

Should the newly formed Honor System committee decide
to institute this death blow to the simple, effective code of gen-
tlemanly conduct here at Washington and Lee and the stu-
dents approve, we would demand that the University not re-
admit offenders after a year’s probation. But this action prob-
ably will not be necessary if the Honor System Committee re-
members that their freedom as students lies in their collective
responsibility as a committee,

So we submit to that committee our own little suggestion
about the Honor System: keep it (the way it is).

A Letter From The Editor

To the students of Washington and Lee University ;

After two months of publishing The Ring-tum Phi, we
have come to a somewhat less-than-startling conclusion:
Washington and Lee students have absolutely no opinions.
This assertion may appear a bit rash on paper, yet what other
conclusion can we draw when we find that week after week of
publishing the newspaper, no letters to the editor have been
submitted ?

We know the following to be given facts: (a) students can
read; (b) students can write: (c) students know what The
Ring-tum Phi is; (d) students have Seen (perhaps read) at
least one copy of this year’s newspaper; and (e) students
realize they may submit letters to the editor in the office in
Reid Hall or by mail to Box 899, Lexington, Va.

Therefore what other conclusion can we deductively reason
from the following facts than that students have no opinions?
Dommage.

In Praise Of Local Color

The Ring-tum Phi was threatened with a law suit last week
because we asked a question of a local merchant in town whom
we had heard was involved with the City of Lexington over
a monetary dispute. He told us in so many words that anything

The

we printed would be used against us in court because it was
hearsay. We told him that if we were intending to print any
hearsay, we wouldn't be there to ask him the particulars. He
wouldn't comment upon the questions we asked of him so
we left without a story.

But not without a tranche de vie, a la Lexington. Can you
imagine any other place in the world a man, wearing a busi-
ness suit and a $10 tie, would threaten a student while the
merchant's trousers were between his waist and his knees as he
was attempting to tuck his shirt-tail in? We may not attend
college in the best of all possible environments, but something
has to be said for our local color,

(Editor's Note: Normally it has

Parking Lot Space At Premium;

Construction Continues Elsewhere

BY MIKE HOUCK

Parking has traditionally been a
problem at Washington and Lee,
and this year, with the influx of
freshman cars, the parking situa-
tion is more acute than ever. Places
near campus are at a premium, and
it is often simpler to walk than at-
tempt to find a convenient space.

In an attempt to alleviate parti-
ally the parking squeeze, the Uni-
versity began construction of three
new parking lots at the end of last
year with plans for having them
open by the beginning of classes this
fall. These lots include an area with
a capacity for 85 cars near Liberty
Hall, a 37 car addition to the Lee
Chapel lot, and two new terrace
parking lots behind the Gym with a
combined capacity of 145 cars,

ge: Interest

somewhat of an experience in co-
education?

Dean Elke Frank: Actually the
program in which Mary Baldwin is
taking part had nothing to do with
sex. Our physics program at Mary
Baldwin was somewhat lacking, we
felt. We encouraged our students
who were interested in pursuing a
study in physics to go to a school
that had a stronger program.

The concept of pooling resources
is not something new. Amherst and

Mock Convention Merits Outweigh Ills

BY ROY CARLTON

At the risk of allying myself with
the rapidly diminishing numbers of
traditionalists on this campus, and
thereby losing all credibility, | can-
not help but take issue with Mr. Ba-
roody’s suggestions regarding the
Mock Convention which appeared
in the October 21 edition of The
Ring-tum Phi. There is a second
danger inherent in such a task. It is
altogether possible that my remark-
ably poor sense of humor has failed
to detect that Mr. Baroody’s exposi-
tion was merely an attempt at satiric
levity. However, despite the lack of
any valid criticisms of the Mock
Convention, | was unable to find
anything which could be considered
amusing by even the broadest stand-
ards,

Aside from the standpoint of tra-
ditionalism, the Mock Convention
has numerous merits, perhaps more
so because of the archaic nature of
the convention system. The concept
of the Washington and Lee Mock
Convention has never been such that
it was an opinion poll of the stu-
dent body. Rather, it is an attempt to
recreate the aura of the convention,
where political manipulation is of
the essence.

No one at the W&L convention is
ever involved in mimicking Order of
the Moose buffoons, unless of course,
Mr. Baroody was. Rather, through
months of research and constant
comtact with the party delegations
and bosses of each state, students
begin to appreciate the inner work-
ings of political machinery.

If a student should choose to be
an activist, it is only through such
an understanding that he can pos-
sibly hope to affect the decision-mak-
ing of a national party. Mr. Baroody
is correct in asserting that the na-
tional party convention is both ar-
chaic and undemocratic, but the al-
logation that it is a thing of the past
is absurdly naive. lt is such a mis-
understanding of the concepts of
power politics that led to the bitter
frustrations of the McCarthy sup
porters at the 1968 Democratic Con
vention. The lessons learned in the
conduct of such a realistic endeavor
«s the W&L Mock Convention can
only help a student in his attempts
to institute popular sovereignity or
elect the candidate of his choice.

The viability of the national con-
vention is unquestionable. Despite
increasing numbers of primaries
throughout the land, it is still at the
party convention where the nomi-
nees are chosen, Witness the nomina
tion of Barry Goldwater in 1964 and
Hubert Humphrey in 1968, Al
though perhaps not having the sup
port of the majority of Republicans,
by shrewd political dealing the Gold
water forces were able to forge an
overwhelming majority of delegates
Ditto concerning the 1968 Demo
cris. Humphrey's popular forces
were perhaps somewhat larger, but
not to the degree thal his conven
ion displayed

The WAL convention abounds
with such political intrigue, As cut
and dried as it may seem to the
freshman, the outcome is usually in
doubt, Otherwise the Reagan, Rocke
feller, and Nixon forces in 1968
would not have spent all the money
they did to win the 1968 Mock Con
vention, The Reagan forces
rumored to have spent almost $10,

were

000. Contacts such as these with the
hidden levels of politics are a broad-
ening experience for the W&L stu-
dent.

Among Mr. Baroody’s lesser argu-
ments he contends that the Conven-
tion costs too much, and that no
student should be assessed. Let it
be pointed out that students are not
assessed for the Convention. Money
is raised through private contribu-
tions. The publicizing effect for
Washington and Lee of such fund
raising is in itself enough reason for
holding the convention.

The authenticity of the W&L
event is unassailable, Not only does
it usuafly reflect the eventual na-
tional convention nominee, but it is
substantially accurate with respect
to the voting of the individual state
delegations. Perhaps Mr. Baroody
will shed a tear at the absence of the
National Guard next year, but then
again, even terrorism and a full-
scale riot in downtown Chicago
couldn't affect the 1968 Democrats.

The City/

I can only express regret that Mr.
Baroody did not find the 1968 Wash-
ington and Lee Mock Convention
to be either entertaining or en-
lightening. | can assure him that
many did. If the convention “de-
generated into an exercise in bore-
dom and bad taste” that is probably
because national conventions are by
nature garish. His contact with the
inner workings of the convention was
probably limited. As a freshman
there are relatively few opportunities
for involvement in the convention.
This, of course, is regrettable. How-
ever, I remember well from 1968
that there were three state chairman-
ships left open for which freshmen
were eligible. The higher one climb-
ed in the convention heirarchy, the
more learning opportunities were
presented. It is difficult to criticise
the Mock Convention for its failures
when one’s participation is only sup-
erficial. The Mock Convention is
like anything else. You get out of
it according to what you put in it.

Presently only the Liberty Hall
area and the small terrace behind
Doremus are in use, while construc-
tion is proceeding slowly on the
other lots. Douglas Brady, Superin-
tendent of Buildings and Grounds,
explains that completion dates on
the facilities were not met because
the parking problem has not been as
serious as was originally expected.
Spaces were planned for 150 fresh-
man cars, but the number thus far
has been significantly lower. The Li-
berty Hall area is seldom used be-
cause of its distance from campus,
and most of the freshmen have evi-
dently decided to park either in back
of the dorms or behind Doremus.

Work on the Lee Chapel lot is
ontinuing, and the area should be
ready before December.

Pooling

Smith and other Ivy League
schools have pooled together in a
consortium. I think that we are re-
alizing that as technology increases
and demands for expensive equip-
ment increases, schools have to pool
together their resources in order to
supply more and better opportuni-
ties for entering college students.

As you can see, the consortium
isn't meant to be an experience in
coeducation whatsoever. We treat
students—be they male or female—
as students.

R-t Phi: What if a male student
decides he wants to come to Mary
Baldwin to study for four years?
Would you accept him?

Frank; No—he would be unhappy
because of the lack of a social life.

R-t Phi: But under the philosophy
you mentioned of treating students
as students, would you accept him?

Frank: In our charter, we are
a woman's college. But we certainly
could accommodate a male student
if he could show that he wanted to
come to study specifically at Mary
Baldwin.

R-t Phi: What are your feelings
about the women’s liberation move-
ment?

Frank: | think women should be
treated as persons. They can do any-
thing a man can do professionally.

We have to combat the fact thai
a girl should first and foremost get
married, be a housekeeper and a
good mother. It was important for a
woman to be domestic at one time,
but I think we have passed those
times. With the technological devices
available for the home now, a wo-
man doesn't have to be a full-time
homemaker.

Letters

To the Editor &

Fodor’s Tribute to Lee

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Please allow me to take up a little “We

of your time and troubling you with

this letter. I assure you that I will

be short and simple. October 5 |
had perhaps the greatest honor in
my life—that is being in Lexington,
Virginia and to pay honor and re-

spect to one of the greatest Ameri- 4

cans of the time—the late General
Robert Edward Lee and the late
President of Washington and Lee
University. | speak, or rather write,
alone and speak for no one but my-
self,

The shame is that no one from
Washington, D.C., the seat of our
nation, was there to pay the respect
to the good man, great man, and
Godly man which Robert Edward
Lee was. I am remembering not one
but all‘ the leaders from the North,
the East, the West, and the South.
Where were they? Were they too
god, to proud, and too big to show
themselves?

If the President could not be there,
why could he not send some one to
speak for him and the nation, Again
I blame both parties and say it is a
shame. I love my country and have
fought for it and offered my life for
her but I am not too proud of some
of her leaders.

This nation will never know no
more men such as Robert Edward
Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and so on.
I believe if we had such as they we
would have a better country and na-
tion and a better world. I assured
you that I would not try to take up
too much of your time. If 1 have or
had I ask your pardon. The honor
and pleasure was all mine.

| Markin gs.

 

BY ROBERT BAROODY

Last week I heard the stery of a
man who believes that bugs are at-
tempting to “take over” the world
from man, its legitimate owner. This
is something most people don’t think
about, concerned as they are with
the insignificant features of their
neurotic and paranoid lives. Pity. It
might be too late to discuss academi-
cally such an ominous threat to our
human depravity. Even as I write
this, a common housefly—insolent
to the sweep of my pen, oblivious to
the weight of these words—creeps
across the page, scampers to this sen-
tence, and deposits its filth here. . .
Accursed beast! Punctuation is not a
personal strength. What’s more, you
are probably a scout for the enemy.

Seriously. Have you noticed the
recent upsurge in the insect popula-
tion explosion, particularly amongst
houseflies? I have, and it’s getting
worse. Instead of their seasonal hib-
ernation, several busy members of
the vanguard are already laying
away the ammunition for a gigantic
spring offensive.

How to combat the insect men-
ace? Poison gas, germ warfare, ster-
ilization; these methods are all
doomed to failure. There is, how-
ever, some hope: a friend of mine
has, over his twenty-one years, per-
fected a sure-fire technique in the
art that is fly extermination. Upon
spying the unfriendly, this fellow
seizes a paperback book and silently
slithers to within two feet of ground
zero. Poised, fingers tensed, wrist at
a Classic 20 degree angle to the swat-
ting surface, he sadistically mutters
“Die bug.” An instant later the
enemy ceases to bee, smeared as it
is on the cover of The Way of Life
by Lao Tse. This man claims that to

 

Insects of the World Unite

insure a 9:1 kill ratio one must use
a lightweight paperback, no more
than half an inch thick, excluding,
of course, The Lord of the Flies.

There are those who do not
possess a copy of The Way of Life.

Imagine if you will this scene in
the emergency situation room of a
Great World Power: There is an
endless flow of administrative sub-
ordinates, each of whom has a fresh
international disaster to report to
che Great World Leader. Through
an open window in dances a carefree
‘bumblebee. As the group of flunkies
hastily retreat, the Great World
Leader lashes out against God’s crea-
tion with How to Win Friends, Make
Money, Enjoy Life, Etc. . . . He
misses his mark; the bee, incensed,
does not. Coincidentally, the hot
line buzzes (sic, sick) with the news
that the bad guys have upset the
economy in northeastern Luxem-
bourg. “That does it” shrieks the
Great World Leader, “Bombs
Away!”

But all this is rubbish. Bugs have
no claim to the Socratic method;
their intelligence is distinctly non-
linear. They do not know the facts,
which are, that after exposure to
600 roentgens of radiation man mis-
erably bleeds to death; insects are
still happy with 100,000 roentgens.
Thus, that beetle crawling up your
Stay-prest tie (or his direct descend-
ants) might be alive and well a few
years hence, munching and crunch-
ing on your glowing corpse. Right
on.

sion, a swimming power. They have
been led by several All-Americans,
the latest of which is Bill Brumback.
Brumback, who has held this honor
for the past two years, is this year's
captain. He is a senior, who holds
the school record in the 50 and the
100 meter freestyle.

Coach Bill Stearns says that this
year’s team is one of the most dedi-
cated that he has ever coached.
Practice started 3 weeks ago. At that
time, there were 37 people out for
the team. After sampling the Coach’s
rugged conditioning, there remain
20 ruged performers, They practice
twice a day, swimming between 10
ind 15 miles a week. This is suposed
to be about twice as much as the
swimmers covered last year. Of the
twenty, 11 are freshman. They will
participate in a full schedule of
Junior Varsity meets,

Coach Stearns lost but two of his
last year’s performers. They were
Roger Martin and Scott MacElroy.
Aside from Brumback, there will be
several swimmers from whom great
things will be expected. One of these
is junior Bim Clark. Bim swims the
100 and the 200 dolphin butterfly.
n the 100 he holds both the schoo!
and the conference record. He is
also one of the versatile swimmers
who gives the squad needed depth.
Burt Meem, last year’s Most Improv-
ed Swimmer, returns. His specialties
are the distance freestyle and the
dolphin butterfly stroke. Another
junior, Rick Sands, is another versa-
tile performer, who should provide
good performances in the breast-
stroke and the individual medley.
Other returnees include Alan Cor-

th, conference record holder in
the 400 individual medley, Price
Blackford (100 and 200  breast-
stroke), Eddie Haslam, and Aven
Sharp. The leading freshman is
Steve Erickson, a high school All-

American from Abingdon, Pennsyl-
vania, Who is swimming now at the
pace of Bill Ball, a W&L All-Ameri-
can two years ago.

This year’s schedule is one of the
toughest in a long while. Among
the teams that the General swim-
mers will face are William and
Mary, which won the state meet last
year, Duke, Johns Hopkins, V.M.I.,
and Va, Tech. The University of
Virginia will be, according to Coach

 

Stearns, “our toughest meet.” The
season starts with Old Dominion,
here, on December 4th. The team’s
season ends with the CAC cham-
pionships, which will take place on
February 25-27, at Lexington, in
the V.M.I. pool.

Despite a lack of depth and of
diving, the Generals have looked
good in practice, and look forward
to the season, the CAC champion-
ships, and for some, the National
Championships.

Football Bounces...

WA&L should get some kind of na-
tional “Homecoming” award. The
Generals’ game at Western Mary-
land Saturday was their fourth
straight Homecoming contest. In-
cluded in that stretch was W&L’s
Homecoming, which the Generals
lost, and the 35-34 spoiler of Tufts
Homecoming. And guess when
Southwestern of Memphis is having
its Homecoming? On Nov. 7, when
the Lynx entertain W&L, of course.

Too Much TV Ball?

     
   

suits, each carrying briefcases. The
Manhattan skyline is hazily visible
through high, smudged windows. An
older but equally distinguished busi-
nessman takes his seat at the head of
the table.

The occasion is not a meeting of
President Nixon's cabinet, nor a top-
secret session of Lexington’s City
Council. However, the convocation
deals with yet another pair of Ameri-
can institutions—those of football
and television. The executives have
met several times already to ponder
what may be (at least this year) an
unanswerable question: has football
over-saturated its market? The tele-
vision execs seem to be concerned,
but according to those impartial
numbers of people from the Nielson
Company, they needn't be.

In the old days people felt that
there was already too much grid ac-
tion on the tube, what with a col-
lege game on Saturday and two on
Sunday. It was more than a sane
wife could bear. Today, though,
when you speak of a football week-
end, you're talking in terms of at
least five games.

ABC rarely broadcasts more than
one college game per Saturday, but
NBC and CBS together show three
programs each Sunday, And start-
ing this year, ABC branched out
into the week-day prime-time arena,
broadcasting a pro game every Mon-
day night. Naturally many of the
tube executives were a little leery
of the public’s reaction to so much
football; the other two networks
figured to capitilize on ABC's ex-
periment by showing a fine stock of
old movies. They figured that by
Monday almost everyone would pre-
fer Doris Day and Rock Hudson to
Len Dawson or Leroy Kelley. But as
the figures rolled in, ABC's daring
move began to reap good results,
Nielson ratings showed that the
games were outdrawing the rival
flicks by a goodly margin. Of course,
in T.V. terms, that means more
money from sponsors seeking to ad-
vertise their particular product to
the most people.

One of the biggest reasons for the
success f the Monday night games
has been the fact that many of the
contests have been more than just
average encounters. That is, many
of the Monday fare have been key
games. Cleveland-Kansas City, Chic-
ago-Detroit, and Minnesota-Los An-
geles have been important meetings.
Secondly, football is probably at its
peak of attraction, a peak that is
liable to remain high for the next
few years. Football has replaced
baseball as the national pastime, and
you know that went on for a long
time. The action found in the sport
appeals to the tempo of the times:
this is not likely to abate in the near
future.

All good things must come to an
end sooner of later, and this applies
to Monday night football, but |
think this prime4ime invasion will
probably be around for quite some
time. Football may have over-ex-
tended itself, but it has not over-
saturated its market. Not yet,

Soccer team battled VMI into overtime but lost, 4-3.

Booters Lose 4-3 To VMI

BY DAVID TORRANCE

Weathermen are always telling us
on the six o'clock news that we need
rain but one thing’s for sure: the
Generals didn’t need it last Wednes-
day, when, on thtt gloomy, rainy
day, they lost to V.M.I. 4-3 in over-
time. The Generals did a credible
job, though, it was a close game all
the way through. In the first period,
V.M.I. scored on a penalty kick,
but W&L tied wp the score in the
2nd with a goal by Brandon Her-
bert. Both teams scored in the 3rd
quarter, W&L’s being credited to
Mike Schaeffer. It looked like W&L’s
game in the first part of the last
period, when Carl Hyatt kicked in
another point for the Blue, but in
the last few minutes of the 4th quar-
ter, V.M.I. clinched it by scoring in
the first overtime, and by keeping
WAL scoreless in both overtime per-

The Generals had several things
working against them. First and fore-
most, was the weather, for during
the game it rained on and off. This
inclement weather surely hindered
the defense. Another thing working
against W&L was the fact that the
game was away at V.M.1. And also,
the Generals are a young team,
Which needed the experience that
this game provided them. Finally,
the offense failed to take advantage
of several good opportunities.

This leaves the Generals with a
1-6 record, with a win against Madi-
son, and losses to Dickinson, Lynch-
burg, the University of Virginia,
Roanoke, Eastern Mennonite, and
V.M.1. But this record does not do
justice to the WAL team. The first
two games, against Dickinson and
Lynchburg, were barely lost, both
by a score of 1-0. In the Eastern
Mennonite game, though the score
was 3-1, the Generals outplayed
their opponents. And finally, against
V.M.L., the Blues almost won.

On Thursday, the Generals go

against Hampden-Sydney, away, a

game in which the former has a good
chance for success. However, Wil-
liam and Mary, whom the Generals
play at home on Friday, will be
tough. They tied U.Va., which beat
W&L, so on Friday, anything can
happen. Then, in the first week of
November, there will be a game
with Jacksonville, which last year
was ranked fifth in the nation.

The Generals’ basic problem this
year has been the youth and inex-
perience of the team, for there are
only four seniors on the team, and
no juniors, In starting positions there
are 8 sophomores and freshman.
rhe squad is still working hard, and
on Thursday they will be able to
show Hampden-Sydney how much
experience they have gained.

Archie, Neer, Roadtrips

| don’t think Ole Miss’ loss two weekends ago will hurt
Archie Manning’s chances for the Heismann Trophy. He had
33 completions and over 300 total yards. SMU took the breaks
from Mississippi which is unusual in a 30-14 win. The Rebels
had statistics on their side, but you know what they say about

 
 

statistics and scores.

sy the way, Sports Information got a card in the mail from
Mike Neer who’s now playing ball in sunny Italy. Here’s a
little bit of what he said:

“Tam getting in shape by jumping up from the table and
fast-breaking to the nearest john. No wonder they never win a
war!

“The set-up seems great and as you can see there's a little
jump from Doremus to here. You'd think I was wearing the
Hope Diamond the way they cater to me, but It’s all O.K. since
I just nod and smile,

“The day after I arrived there was a big color front page
photo of yours truly which no doubt was used by every mama
in Italy to line the barbage cans. . .

Oh, probably, Mike.

Probably the most exciting sport at W&L has been road-
tripping. Today, however, it has slowed a bit and has become
far less sacred. I say this with a sense of loss, but I guess it’s
my fault as much as anyone’s.

| remember the good ole days when at any moment Frank's
or the Dalia would be packed. There were various contingents.

W. Maryland Trips Generals, 37-21

A wide-open passing offense,
sparked by quarterback Steve Flu-
harty in the last two games, seems to
be the answer to half of the W&L
Generals’ losing problem: that of
scoring points. The unanswered half
is just preventing the opposition
from scoring. It was the latter that
turned out to be the downfall of the
Blue on Saturday as Western Mary-
land outscored W&L 37-21.

Fluharty’s passing, 24 completions
out of 36 attempts for 234 total
yards was the offense ignition. The
“Chief,” Steve Mahaffey, was on the
receiving end of 17 of those for 144
yards. Three Fluharty passes went
for touchdowns.

Receiving the opening kick-off,
Western Maryland moved from
their own 39 yard line to the W&L
4 in less than four minutes. A staunt

Cross Country
Over Davidson

The cross country team is 4 and
2 after beating Davidson and losing
to VMI in the tri-meet at Davidson.
The scoring between W&L and Da-
vidson was 24-33 and the score of
the meet with VMI was 15-50.

The performers were very good
considering the condition of the
course due to the rainy weather all
day. Bill Kalal, a freshman, led the
Generals with a time of 29:13 on
the Davidson 5 mile course. Bill
Wilkinson was second for the team
with a time of 29:17. The next two
finishers for the Generals at Sth and
6th were Tom Young and Bob Sher-
wood. Tom Young with a time of
30:16 has been constantly improv-
ing himself throughout the season;
he will be very aviuable in the CAC
meet on Nov, 7, in St. Louis.

Carter Glass finished 8th thus giv-
ing W&L the five places needed to
win. Jim Horner and Tim Kearney
placed 10th and 11th; both of these
runners are freshman and have been
turning in strong times on their
home course. Strong finishes were
viso turned in by Paul Wilber and
Mike Guroian.

Last Saturday, Bridgewater beat
the team 21-34 thus dropping W&L’s
record to 4 and 3. The best times of
the year were seen in this meet.
Placing 4th overall and Ist for the
team was Bill Kalal with a time of
24:19 on the home 4.1 course, Plac-
ing 2nd for the team and 6th over-
all was Bill Wilkinson; just behind
Wilkinson were Tom Young, Carter
Glass, and Jim Horner. The next
finishers for W&L were Paul Wilber,
Bob Sherwood and Doug MeNeil,
Mike Guroian came back with an-
other strong showing along with Tim
Kearney. Jim Haydon, Bill Rowe,
and Wayne Baker have turned in
consistent performances.

W&L goalline stand prevented six
points, but failed to stop three on a
twenty yard field goal. Punts filled
the stadium as the remainder of the
first quarter ran out with Western
Maryland in front, 3-0.

Just as the second quarter open-
ed the Generals took firm hold of a
Maryland punt on their own 40 and
marched the entire 60 yards to score
on Fluharty’s first touchdown pass,
18 yards to JoJo Martin, Mahaffey
hauled in four during the drive for
over half the yardage picked up.
Doug Chase’s conversion flung the
Blue into the lead 7-3.

The momentum stuck. On the
very next possession, W&L churned
55 yards to score on Fluharty’s sec-
ond touchdown toss, this one 18
yards to Bruce Green with 8:50 still
remaining in the half. Chappy Con-
rad's big reception of 15 yards to the
Maryland 18 set the score up. The
PAT was blocked but the Generals
held a very commanding 13-3, until
the half.

Western Maryland returned in

Player of the

 

the third quarter to score twice. The
momentum shifting, Maryland mov-
ed entirely on the ground from their
own 19 to the W&L 22. George
Harris intercepted their first pass at-
tempt at the 17 to seemingly end the
threat. But on the very next play,
Western intercepted a Fluharty pass
to the W&L 34. The ensuing call,

a 34 yard touchdown pass, put Mary-

land back into the game with 4:16
left in the quarter. The conversion
was good; the score 13-10 with the
Generals still in front.

Another Maryland drive, 69 yards,
again almost entirely on the ground,
put six more on the board on a
quarterback sneak of 2 yards, The
PAT put Western into a lead they
never relinquished, 17-13, with only
57 seconds left in the quarter.

WAL tried a comeback moving to
the Maryland 13 early in the fourth
quarter, the Generals poised for an
attempt to score. A Western fumble
recovery on the Maryland 10 dash-
ed all hopes of revival and the Blue
settled into discouragement. The fol-

lowing play saw the Maryland quar-
terback sneak 80 yards until he was
tripped up on the W&L 10. Two
plays later, a 7 yard TD run put the
game out of reach, 24-13.

Surprising everyone, the Generals
received the kickoff and waltzed 74
yards with the help of 2 penalties
and 4 pass completions, the last to
Chappy Conrad, for 10 yards from
Fluharty for the score. Mahaffey
snared the two point conversion and
the score squeezed closer, 24-21.

To add insult to injury, the Mary-
land team scored its last two touch-
downs on pass interceptions, one for
27 yards and the other setting up «
25 yard end run. One conversion
failed, the other was good and the
final score ended a runaway, 37-21.

On defense, exceptional play
came again from Marshall Wash-
burn, George Harris, and Dave
Brooks.

This week, the Generals return
home to a Parents’ Weekend crowd
against Sewanee at 2:30 on Satur-
day.

Senior end Frank Stearns noted
that the victory over Tufts was
W&L’s first on a “flying” trip in
Stearns’ four years on the team, de-
spite 2-3 airplane trips each year.
During that span, Stearns comment-
ed, all W&L victories have come
either at home or on shorter bus
trips.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee University’s Weekly Newspaper

OINT

| H
On Rush

BY ROY CARLTON

(Editor’s Note: This edition marks
the beginning of a weekly feature
“PinPoint,” which will appear in this
column of The Ring-tum Phi’s front
page. “PinPoint” is a column of news
analysis and commentary upon any
recent event of significance to the
University. The opinions expressed
in this column do not necessarily
represent those of The Ring-tum
Phi.)

To no one’s surprise the debut of
Washington and Lee’s extended rush
period has proven to be a failure.
The full consequences of the venture
and the degree of its impotence will
only be known later in the year as
the number of fraternity deactiva-
tions mount, but in the meantime
some limited conclusions may be
drawn.

Last year some 75% of the fresh-
man class pledged fraternities during
one of the smallest rushes in me-
mory.

This year 58% of the freshman
class pledged. Besides being the
worst rush in Washington and Lee
history, the inequities in the size of
the pledge classes ranged uniformly
from two to twenty-four.

Compounding the difficulties of
the fraternities is the rash of deacti-
vations since early jast year. In an
article which I researched for The
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi of Nov. 11,
1969 it was shown that rising deacti-
vations had contributed to a mem-
bership dilemma for the fraternities.
Conspicuously, only one fraternity
had been successful in keeping its
members in the fold, Kappa Alpha.
At the time the article went to press
they had only one deactivate. Seven
months later a mass exodus from
the membership rolls had forced the
chapter to fold.

Such difficulties had not bees
confined to Kappa Alpha only. 1969-
70 also saw Kappa Sigma fold and
numerous other houses were rumor-
ed to be voting on the possibility.

Obviously the only solution to the
fraternities’ difficulties could come
from a good rush. Holding the
pledges within the ranks would be
a difficulty to be contended with
later,

Fifty-eight percent was below the
most pessimistic predictions. To be
sure, the houses had more than the
customary share of problems with 1
new rush system. Rushing techniques
had to be adjusted. A good image
had to be sustained for a longer per-
iod of time. Limited contacts had to
be cultivated to their utmost and
dirty rushing would become a way of
life. Nevertheless, with the record
of depledgings and deactivations his-
tory had given us, 58% is not enough
to sustain sixteen fraternities.

There is substantial grounds for
laying the blame on the IFC. Not io
indulge in the traditional game of
IFC baiting, it must be said thal
the Council made the best of a bad
situation. However, in the past with
a one-week rush it was easy to bully
the freshman class into pledging
early. The naive freshman saw his
friends pledging and was threatened
by social ostracism. Now, with two
months to survey his situation, many
of freshman has apparently decide:
to trust in himself

The IFC sought (following rush)
to discover if the new rush period
was too long. The effort was belai-
ed and will be ineffectual. Making
a personal estimate of the situation,
| would not be at all surprised [
the number of fraternity men left on
campus is considerably less than
S0% as opposed to 754 when |
first came to this campus. The weak-
er houses will fold this year. A new
rush system will not help them 4
though it may save one or two from
folding next year

Troub’s First Fare

Premieres

BY CAL WHITEHURST

The Troubadour Theatre opens its
1970-71 season tonight at 8:30 with
“Billy Budd,” an adaptation of the
Herman Melville novel.

The play, written by Louis O.
Coxe and Robert Chapman, is set
aboard a British ship-of-the-line in
the year 1798, a time when the Eng
lish navy was confronted with war
against France and mutinies among
its Own crews.

Brooks Atkinson, who reviewed
the Coxe-Chapman production for
the “New York Times,” gives an ac-
curate summary of the play’s mean-
ing. “Absolute good and absolute
evil cannot live in this world togeth-
er, according to Melville,” Atkinson
wrote, “each must destroy the other,
for human life is a compromise that
follows the middle way.”

In the play. Billy Budd, a hand-
some sailor, is an innocent who can-
not comprehend that there is evil in
the world. John Claggart, the ship's
master-at-arms, is the personifica
tion of that evil. Resenting Billy's
complete trust and lack of fear, Clag-
gart accuses Billy of being the ring-

Dr. Leonard Berkowitz, Vilas re

cause the boy's execution.

Billy, speechless with fury at Clag-
gart’s treachery, strikes out blindly
and kills him. The denouncement is
swift. Law supercedes justice and
Billy is hanged for his crime.

Troubadour director Ellen Barnes
has added a closing scene which was
not included in the Coxe-Chapmaa
original. After Billy is hanged, the
ship's officers exit and the crew re-
sumes their normal activities. With
this additional scene, Mrs. Barnes
makets a point distinctly lacking in
the original text of the play: that is,
the conflict between good and evil
really has very little effect on the
basic monotony of life.

“Billy Budd” will be presented
each night through Saturday at 8:30.

BY ROGER MUNSICK

Two individuals closely associ-
ated with Washington and Lee
won statewide offices in Tennes-
see last election night.

William E. Brock HI, a mem-
ber of the Class of 1953 defeated
incumbent Senator Albert Gore,
who was seeking to win election
to a fourth term in Washington.
Last spring, Brock had defeated
Tex Ritter, the country singing
star, in the Republican primary.

Brock, Republican Congress-
man for the past six years, was
backed strongly by Nixon admini-
stration support, including per
sonal visits in Tennessee by the
President and Vice-President Ag-
new. Brock was one of several
Republican congressmen who
passed up virtually certain re-elec-
tion to attempt to defeat incum-
bent Democratic Senators.

The Roanoke Times this morn-
ing credited Brock with 52% of
the vote with 88% of the ballots
counted.

Brock, 40, was a member of

 

Brock, Dunn Win Races

the Banking and Currency com-
mittee in Congress, and also serv-
ed on a special Congressional
committee that investigated camp-
us unrest last year.

In 1964, Brock served as Pa-
rade Marshal for the 1964 Mock
Republican Convention at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Winfield Dunn, the father of
Chuck Dunn of Memphis, Wash-
ington and Lee sophomore, won
the Tennessee gubernatorial race
for the Republicans. He is the
first GOP governor of the Volun-
teer State in half a century.

Dunn defeated his Democratic
opponent by a margin roughly
comparable to that of Brock. He
earns the position now held by
Buford Ellington, a Democratic
governor who did not seek re-
election.

Dunn, a dentist by profession,
had long been prominent in party
politics and has been credited in
large part with building up the
GOP organization in populous
Shelby County which includes
Memphis.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
November 4, 1970

In Case You Haven’t Noticed...

If anyone in our readership on campus has reached these
columns and still finds himself without any evening activities
for the next few days, he has obviously missed the front page
of this newspaper entirely.

At the hours of 4:00 and 8:00 tomorrow evening, students
will have the opportunity to exchange ideas with Dr. Henry
Steele Commager, a historian widely known for his commen-
tary on the present state of higher education. His visit will in-
augurate Contact’s symposium this year, “The Crisis in Educa-
tion ;” and we can think of no more timely a topic for ardent
discussion and careful thought. Dr. Commager has expressed a
desire to be in constant discussion with students throughout
his brief stay ; we trust the students will reciprocate that desire.

Contact is not the only annual event on campus making its
yearly debut this week. 8:30 tonight will mark the beginning of
the 1970-71 Troubadour Theatre season with Coxe and Chap-
man’s “Billy Budd’ (or perhaps we should call it Coxe and
Chapman and Barnes’ “Billy Budd,” for we've got it that Mrs.
Ellen Barnes has wrought quite a dramatic creation out of an
extremely difficult script). We advise our readers to forget
about seeing tonight's performance—the theatre will be filled.
Perhaps the best time to see the show will be the Saturday
afternoon performance which was added to the schedule yes-
terday because of the flurry of reservations made early in the
week, “Billy Budd” promises to be a worthwhile experience ;
make the effort.

October 22’s Homeroom Election

Mr. Alan Prater’s letter to the editor which appears on page
three of this edition is extremely disturbing. One cannot read-
ily imagine active campaigning about the ballot boxes on
campus; yet the thought of a member of the Executive Com-
mittee doing some suggestive campaigning of his own taxes
the imagination beyond endurance.

Yet we are somewhat comforted by the fact that by resort-
ing to tactics of this sort, the persons involved have made these
elections a shade less significant than an eighth grade home-
room election. At least a homeroom election is monitored by
teachers who have no interest whatsoever in the outcome.

A Prologue For Dr. Commager

We thought it might be of interest to our readers if we pre-
sented a small prologue to Dr. Commager'’s visit to Washing-
ton and Lee tomorrow by penning a few comments of our own
on “The Crisis In Education.” Upon perusal of the editorial
columns of The Wall Street Journal’s October 26, 1970 edi-
tion, however, we found to no surprise that that newspaper's
editors had surpassed our capacity for eloquence. Therefore
we present the following excerpts from “Official Truth, Camp-
us Version” as a keynote to Dr. Commager’s visit.

“One of the more interesting aspects of the campus scene
is the arrogance of the militant students—and of quite a few
faculty members as well. They talk and act as though they were
the sole recipients of Revealed Truth.

“This whole phenomenon is well described in a New York
Times Magazine article by John P. Roche, a Brandeis Univer-
sity professor and a man of high liberal credentials.

“It is nothing new for a university to be pressured by out-
siders who want it to proclaim their particular version of
Truth. But today the pressure is coming from students and
faculty within the university. They demand that it officially de-
clare itself on various issues.

“Thus after Cambodia and Kent State last spring, many
faculties voted resolutions announcing such things as “fer-
vent opposition” to the U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia
and “solidarity with our students” against political repression
in America and applied war research at universities. Writes
Mr. Roche:

“*As far as Brandeis and probably 300 institutions of higher
learning in the United States (who went through the same
drill) are concerned, it is Officially True that the United States
is ‘repressive,’ that the Indochina war is an immoral, imperialist
foray and that war-related research is wicked, (Mr. Roche
happens to believe that the U.S. is one of the least repressive
societies in history, that the war in Indochina is not immoral
and imperialist, and that war-related research is not necessarily
wicked.)

“An unhappy corollary of this intolerant conformism is its
implication that the professors should teach the students the
conformist view of truth. Professor Roche finds that approach
indefensible, and so do we.

“In this and other ways the idea of Community Truth vio-
lates academic freedom itself and drastically distorts the con-
cept of a university, As Mr. Roche says: “The best definition
of a good education | have ever encountered was that it in-
volves growing up in an atmosphere of intellectual conflict,
even chaos, where talented young people are constantly forced

ing his own),

“Plainly we consider Mr. Roche's views a most useful con

rational conformism, it is encouraging that a good many such
men are still around, able and willing to battle the forces of in

The Mystery Of
Law and Order
In “Billy Budd”

BY STEVE HAUGHNEY

During the political campaign
just concluded, the phrase “law and
order” was bandied about so many
times and by so many candidates of
different political perspectives that
any reasonable force it may have
once conveyed was lost and gave way
to a purely emotive force.

The vexing questions about the
relationships of law and of justice,
of authority and of individual rights
were passed over by candidates
seeking to exploit their (public's
hopes and fears and to suppress any
reasonable examination of these
problems, But long after the cam-
paign rhetoric has subsided, the prob-
lems remain, the questions still large-
ly unasked.

“Billy Budd,” the Trowbadour
Theater production opening tonight
and running through Saturday, raises
these questions, and it does so with
an insistent and dramatic power that
is the play’s most remarkable fea-
ture. The script, written by Louis
Coxe and Robert Chapman, is an
adaptation of the well-known Mel-
ville novella which depicts the story
of Budd, a paradigm of extreme in-
nocence and goodness, as he is
brought into conflict with law and
authority. It is a morality play, in
essence, a play which, although ele-
mental, defies simplification.

This is Ellen Barnes's first produc-
tion as acting director for the
Troubs, and judging from the re-
hearsal I saw Monday night, it pro-
mises to be an interesting season.
She has added a dramatic frame to
the play, with the sailors perform-
ing mundane chores and engaging in
petty amusements at the beginning
and at the end, in an attempt to place
this extraordinary action in an every-
day context.

The conflict ‘between extreme
goodness, in the person of Budd,

and extreme evil, in the person of
Claggart the Master-at-arms, is re-
solved by the law so that its effect
on ‘normal’ life is minimal; the ac-
tion of the play is contained within
this overriding irony.

In interpreting characters Mrs.
Barnes and her actors run a great
risk, for the play very readily con-
verts to melodrama of the worst sort
if the dramatis personae are not por-
trayed with subtlety and precision;
yet this danger has been skillfully
avoided, and the leading characters
are presented as complex men strug-
gling with complex moral problems.
Claggart, as freshman Doug Huttoa
in his first Troub production por-
trays him, is a man dominated by
spite and fear whose hatred for
Budd is matched only by his facina-
tion with him.

 

The sailors perform mundane chores and engage in petty amusements
to place the extraordinary action in everyday context.

The character of Budd presents
the greatest challenge, from the ac-
tor’s standpoint, in the play, for he is
the least believable and the closest
to an abstraction; yet Scott Reiger
humanizes him and makes him the
commanding figure of the drama.
Captain Vere, played by O. K.
Barnes, is at once impassioned and
philosophic.

Bob Carrere and Cal Whitehurst,
as the ship's two young officers, are
very good, as is David Christovich
as Jenkins. Of special note are Steve
Lester, playing Dansker, the old
man whose terse comments provide
much of the intellectual power of
the play, and Walkie May, whose
portrait of Squeak almost steals the
show. The actors and the directress
do an admirable job with a play
that is difficult to present.

Once again O. K. Barnes has de-
signed a great set, and one well in-
tegrated with the action of the play.
This set, with its long deck extend-
ing back through the proscenium
arch, seems to draw the audience
into the drama, while the rigging
presents an illusion of height per-
fectly suited to the action. It is with-
in this setting that the conflict be-
tween ‘natural’ goodness and all-too-
human law takes place, a conflict
whose outcome is made more ter-
rible by the fact that it is inevitable
because it is the human reality.

After all the political rhetoric we
have been subject to these past few
months, it is refreshing (and frigh:-
ening) to see the meaning of “law
and order” presented dramatically
in all its mystery.

Canine Friends, WLUR--
Two Noteworthy Features

Dogs to Aid Police Force

Criminals in Lexington are now
faced with a distinctly non-human
adversary on the City Police Force:
two German Shepherds which have
been undergoing professional train-
ing for two months.

The two canine rookies, King and
Roark, are now padding a beat with
night officers as they make their
rounds of checking places of busi-
ness. They are owned by Lt. R. L.
VanDerVeer and Patrolman Jack C.
Purvis, and are being trained under
the supervision of Bob Whiteside, a
professional trainer from Roanoke
who has trained dogs throughout the
state. Although the officers person-
ally own the dogs, the police depart-
ment finances the training and the
food for them.

Well-trained in obedience, the dogs
can assist the officers in crowd coa-
trol, tracking lost or injured persons,

Student Taxes, But No Votes

BY DOUG BURTON

Professor Ritz in a letter to the
Lexington News-Gazette (Oct. 14)
argued that “a person subjected to
the burdens of residency, such as
the payment of taxes, is also entitl-
ed to the benefits of such residency,
such as the right to vote.” City Man-
ager Guy Agnor told The Ring-tum
Phi last Tuesday that payment of
local taxes such as the motor ve-
hicle tax does in no way entitle stu-
dents to vote in local elections,

“The automobile license tax is a
usage fee,” Agnor said, “for the ex-
pense of providing public parking,
street maintenance, snow removal,
traffic signs, cic.”

In reply to charges that the li-
encse revenue had not been stipu-
lated for street maintenance, he ex-
plained that “street maintenance is
financed by a general fund, and ap-
propriations for street maintenance
are directly related to the amount of
tax revenue from motor vehicle |i-
censes Revenue from the state
highway maintenance funds gives
$70,930 to the city of Lexington
Local licence revenue is estimated to
be $29,000, The sum of these figures
is the amount budgeted by the city
for street maintenance,” Agnor said,
“which isn't enough as you can see
by the nunmvber of chugholes in the
streets.”

The city manager noted that the
city is also empowered to collect a
personal property tax from students,
although this does not entitle stu
dents to voting privileges

This is disconcerning news to
reiny studenis, who, under present

Virginia law must be 21 years of age
and residents for one year before
they can vote in Virginia, although
they do not have to wait 15 minutes
to puy city taxes in Lexington.

As Dr. Ritz has pointed out, the
present one-year requirement has
already been declared unconstitu-
tional by one one federal judge and
is now before a three judge federal
court. A revision in the proposed
new Virginia Constitution would re-
duce the residency requirement for
voling to six months,

This act coupled with the enact
ment last spring by Congress of
legislation under which the states
will be required after January 1,
1971 to permit all persons 18 years
of age and older to vote in all elec-
tions might convert the student
bodies of WAL and VMI into 2500
eligible voters in Rockbridge county

In answer to Dr. Ritz, William
Dunlap, chairman, Rockbridge
County Electoral Board, in his own
letter to the News-Gazette (Oct, 28)
quoted from Section 24 of the Vir
ginia Constitution: “No officer, sol
dier, seamen, or marine of the Unit
ed States army or navy shall be
deemed to have gained a residence as
to the right of sufferage, in the state,
of in any county, cily or town there
of by reason of being stationed
therein; nor shall an inmate of any
charitable institution or a student in
any institution of learning, be re
garded as having cither gained oF
lost a residence, as to the right of
suffrage, by reason of his location
OF sojourn in sich institutions

Dunlap also stuled: “The right to

vote is spelled out in the Constitu-
tion of Virginia and is not granted
to a person by any local governing
body. The payment of taxes does not
qualify a person to vote,”

Agnor also told The Ring-tum Phi
that should a student decide to de-
clare Lexington his residence, he
would be asked to make a declara-
tion of his personal property and
would be sent a state income tax
form.

and will attack only when ordered to
do so. They can be useful instru-
ments in searches for wanted per-
sons and are trained to capture and
detain criminals until their masters
can take over.

WLUR Covers Elections

Beginning last night at 7:00 p.m.,
WLUR-FM presented complete elec-
tion coverage which continued until
the last returns were in. The several
phases of the election were covered
differently, with the Associated Press
Wire Service supplying informa-
tion on national and statewide races,
and student reporters calling in to
report local results.

Operating with a forty man staff,
WLUR was able to place over eigh-
teen reporters in the field. Polling
places in Lexington and Buena Vista
were covered, as were the headquar-
ters of candidates in Richmond, Roa-
noke, Winchester, and Charlottes-
ville.

Reporters who had familiarized
themselves with a particular candi-
date or a particular race acted as
commentators, discussing various
aspects of the election and possible
voting trends.

NOTICE

The Calyx staff announces that
individual picture proofs are now
ready. Students are requested to
come to Andre Studio on West Nel-
son Street between 9 and 5 before
next Thursday, Novenvber 12 to se-
lect the pictures. The charge is $3.50
and students are required to pay.

Letters
To the Editor

On Freshman Elections
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Many people have been com-
(plaining about our system of  stu-
dent government here at W&L. They
claim it does not allow for adequate
class representation ‘because of the
small number of persons chosen to
“do the representing’. This ano-
maly is compounded when one fra-
ternity is able to strong-arm the elec-
tion of representatives,

The freshman class elections of
two weeks ago produced some rath-
er surprising results—but perhaps
not so surprising when one takes a
cnitical eye to the voting procedure.

It has always been the procedure
of the Executive Committee to use
ballot boxes and hand-counting in-
stead of more sophisticated machin-
ery. I don’t necessarily argue with
this. However, this necessitates a
close watch on the ballot box—pre-
sumably by members of the Execu-
tive Committee.

How did three people manage to
stage unbelievable runaways in the
runoffs? Well, I suppose much can
be attributed to their particular
abilities—but then, these abilities
did not manifest themselves to such
a peculiar degree in the primary
election. I have been approached
by several members of the freshman
class who noticed that the E.C. were
not the only persons watching the
polls during the runoffs.

Being a pledge in a large, power
ful, politically connected fraternity
is certainly an asset, especially if
your frat brothers mill around the
polling boxes and do some last-min-
ute campaigning. This is what has
been reported ot me by several fresh-

men: members of Pi Kappa Alpha
were pushing for their freshmen
candidates around the boxes. Very
close around the boxes.

This is, to begin with, unethical.
As a matter of fact, one freshman,
whose name I have withheld by re-
quest, was in the process of making
out his ballot when Craig Jones, who
was manning that particular box,
asked, “Are you sure that’s what
you want to do?” At the time, the
freshman was not voting for the
PiKA candidate for E.C. Now,
please bear in mind that, in this, 1
am merely relating what was repor'-
ed to me. The freshman (promptly
told Jones to go to hell.

Right on.

Barksdale’s Thanks

To the editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

‘May I use the columns of your
newspaper to comment about some-
thing that has nothing to do with
Vietnam, environmental pollution,
inflation, drugs, or any of the other
critical problems that are much on
our minds, but that has very much
to do with the quality and humanity
of our lives. I refer to the concert of
October 27 by I Solisti di Zagreb
when for two enjoyable hours the
generation and culture gap seemed
to narrow appreciably as old and
young alike found again that great
music performed ‘by distinguished
artists can heal our differences, ele-
vate our spirits, and simply bring
pleasure.

To those of us who have worked
to make possible twenty-five years of
fine music and theater under au-
spices of the Rockbridge Concert
Theater Series, it was especially gra-
tifying to see the largest audience at
last week’s concert that we have had
for some time, and to note how
warmly responsive it was. It was es-
pecially pleasing to see a large turn-
out of students. The Series has more

year than it has had in several. This
s encouraging and most gratifying,
despite a drop in membership at
Southern Seminary and VMI.

Those who have worked to make
the Series possible include a lot of
people, and thanks are due to the
ladies who labored at the eternally
difficult task of selling subscriptions,
to the Lexington News-Gazette and
radio stations WREL and WLUR-
FM for generous and helpful pub-
licity, to Mayor D. E. Brady for his
proclamation recognizing the Series’
25th anniversary, and to the two
Lexington colleges and many indivi-
duals and business firms who through
sustaining memberships have pro-
vided jiberal financial support. But
most of all, thanks are due to the
members of the Series themselves—
from grade schoolers attending their
first concert to some who have rare-
ly missed a concert in the past 25
years—for there is not much the
Board cannot do if we have enough
members and very little it can do if
we don’t have members.

And just in case there is some-
body reading this who may not have
been present at the opening concert
to get his ration of spiritual nourish-
ment, let me remind him that it isn’t

too late to join up and still hear

three more splendid attractions. Yet
to visit Lexington in this Silver An-
niversary season are exciting Korean
tenor Philip Cho, the Preservation
Hall Jazz Band from New Orleans,
and the distinguished New York Pro
Musica. I am willing to guarantee
that anybody who hears these three
remaining concerts will be a better
person for having done so, besides
which he will have had a lot of
genuine pleasure.

Arnold Questions Paper
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:
At a time when there is so much
going on at Washington and Lee and
the surrounding community, so many

Page 3

issues concerning us as students that
are here now present before us and
were here when we arrived, it strikes
me that The Ring-tum Phi has done
little, save in extra-ordinary cir-
cumstances, to confront and report
these issues, It strikes me as a piti-
able failure in journalism and in
maintaining the role of a school
newspaper.

I have two recommendations: (a)
that you involve yourselves not so
much with the great issues which

ynfront this University (although
they too should be examined in their
(proper context), ‘but with the minor,
irritating issues which confront too
many of the student body each day,
May I suggest issues such as Fresh-
man/Sophomore P.E. — whether it
is valid, necessary, and worth the
inconvenience. Issues such as athle-
tic scholarships—whether we need
them, want them, or even, in fact,
can have them. Whether the coach-
ling staff at Washington and Lee is
proviidng the leadership necessary
for active participation in intercol-
legiate athletics. Whether the ad-
ministration has done everything it
can to do aid athletics, or athletic
participation.

And (b) may I suggest that you
cease to be so interested in that side
of the issue which is “right”, or
I am afraid that this is merely a
“good” (you must forgive me here,
value judgment of mine) and that in-
stead you concern yourselves more
with merely presenting issues which
need to be aired, and not necessarily
adjudicated.

This is not meant to ‘be a lambasi-
ing, and I trust that you will not in-
terpret it as such. I am not interest-
ed in carrying crosses. I do think,
however, that the Ring-tum Phi
might ‘be much more interesting if
it were to tread on a few toes which
at least in my Opinion have gone too
long untreaded, and raise some is-
sues which have for too long gone
unquestioned. Thank you very much.

Ruggers Dominate U.Va.

The half ended with W&L leading

weeks ago. In that game, it took
scores by Tom Baker and John Grif-
fith in the last five minutes to salvage
a victory.

This weekend the Club travels to
North Carolina and the final game
of the fall season will be the follow-
ing weekend against VMI.

 

Hats are off this week to the foot-
ball team and the coaching staff for
last Saturday's spectacular 13-0 upset
of Sewanee. The offense and the de-
fense finally seemed to jell, putting
together a team effort heretofore
unseen this year.

Up until last week, many were
muttering that the Generals might
wind up with but one victory, their
35-34 edging of Tufts. W&L had
managed to get drubbed just about
every time the football team step-
ped on the field: Emory and Henry,
Towson State, Centre, Hampden-
Sydney, and Western Maryland had
all enjoyed comfortable victories.
But all that was last week.

Offensively, the Generals came
back again and again, plugging for
yardage behind the running of Doug
Grossmann and JoJo Martin and

the arm of quarterback Steve Flu-
harty. Flu connected sixteen times in
thirty four tries for 198 yards, zing-
ing TD tosses of eleven and three
yards to flanker Bruce Green.

The receptions more than made
up for the Green's fluke fumble on
the two in which the ball rolled into
and cut of the end zone for a touch
back, giving the possession on thei:
twenty yard line.

The offensive line deserves a lot of
credit for prying holes into the Se-
wanee line for W&L’s ground game
and for providing Fluharty with pass
protection. Flu spent this game look-
ing downfield to his receivers rather
than on his back looking at the sky.

The defense performed brilliantly,
perhaps remembering the crucifixion
that W&L received last year in the
Tigers’ den, 37-21. That sixteen
point spread, the coals of which
smouldered until last Saturday, had
incensed Defensive Coach Boyd
Williams. The Generals’ keen de-
fense immobilized Sewanee's vaunt-
ed single-wing running game, caus-
ing the Tigers to change their game
plan and go to the airways.

WE&L's alert secondary put the
clamps to Tiger quarterback Gary
Sims’ efforts, practically taping
themselves to enemy receivers. Dave
Brooks, teaming with Jimmie Allen
and Marshall Washburn, played pro-
bably his best game of the year.
Sewanee's only puncture of this ae-
rial defense, a seemingly freak touch-
down reception which bounced out
of a defender’s hands, was nuilified
by an illegal procedure penalty
against the Tigers.

The important thing to remem-
ber, however, is that the Generals
rallied for this key game. Sewanee,
coming into the contest as an eigh-
teen point favorite, had defeated
conference pacesetier Cenire, 21-17,
ind was trying for the CAC cham
p.onship. With Saturday's viciory

Generals not only closed tic
door on the Tigers’ chances, but also
improved their own.

The General's now I-I in confer-
ence, can take at least a part of the
CAC crown by winning their last two
games with conference opponeriis
Southwestern and Washington.

ball anytime, 4-5 record or not.

Generals Turn Tables On Tigers,

BY PETER JONES
In spite of the old football adage,
“you can’t throw the ball in muddy
conditions,” Steve Fluharty complet-
ed 15 passes, two to Bruce Green
for touchdowns, en route to a 13-0
waxing of favored Sewanee before a

rain-dwindled Parents’ Weekend
crowd.

The defense definitely deserves tre-
mendous praise for their best per-
formance thus far this season. It’s
difficult to single out the most out-

standing though Frank Evans, Dave

Brooks, George Harris, and Scott
Neese combined for a large part of
the success that held the strong Se-
wanee ground game to only 27
yards rushing.

Sewanee received the opening
kickoff and their offense, a single

. then catches another between two Sewanee defenders setting up W&L’s

wing that just about Says to the de-
fense “Watch out, we're coming right
this way,” failed to move. W&L’s
first possession proved fruitless also.
The first quarter ended with nothing
more than the two teams’ punters
warming up.

But in the second quarter, a Se-
wanee punt found its ‘way into the
arms of Dave Brooks, who galloped
52 yards to the Sewanee 21. After
three passing attempts had failed,
Fluharty hit Bruce Green with a
crucial fourth down toss to the three
yard line. On the following play, the
same combination connected for the
score that proved to be the margin
of victory. Doug Chase’s PAT was
good and the score stood, 7-0.

The remainder of the quarter saw
little offensive punch except a Se-
wanee bomb of 30 yards for a touch-
down that bounced off at least three
pairs of hands but a penalty nullified
the play.

rhe rain fell intermittently as the
third quarter opened with the Gen-
erals receiving. More punts ensued,
a total of 19 in the game, but there’s
one play of the quarter Bruce Green
will probably have nightmares about.
Fluharty hit him with a 30 yard pass
to the Sewanee 10, and as he turned
up the sidelines and into the end-
zone, a Sewanee defender jarred the
ball out of bounds; and to com-
pound the matter, the officials gave
it to Sewanee on the rule of last pos-
session.

The fourth quarter again saw very
little offensive progress but plenty
of defense. The Generals’ final score
was set up by Marshall Washburn as
he intercepted a Sewanee pass and
returned it to their 10 yard line. On
the following play, Green snared his
second T.D. aerial from Fluharty.
The PAT was wide and for the re-
maining 5 minutes, the Blue defense
thwarted all attempts of a Sewanee
comeback.

Through this past week's game,
Fluharty has completed 94 passes for
1,109 yards and 6 touchdowns, sta
tistics which rank him number 1
among the nation’s passers. Steve
Mahaffey’s five receptions gives him
51 for the year for 687 yards and 2
touchdowns, a third ranking among
the nation’s receivers,

(Continued from Page 1)
Cole, president of the Publications
Board and Contact chairman.

The number of parents in attend-
ance was limited, due probably in
large part to Friday’s heavy rain.
But the parents displayed a genuine
interest in “sounding out” the stu-
dent representatives on a number of
questions, ranging from immediate
university problems to general poli-
tical issues.

One mother launched the initial
question by asking about the pro-
gress and/or fate of the “seminar
plan,” known as the Free University,
which was initiated last May. Robin-
son replied that the plan had been
“worthwhile experience” but com-
plained that students were not able
to take full advantage of the semi-
nars because of required studies.

The second question from parents
was “what are student feelings on
coeducation?” Robinson came out
immediately against the idea, saying
that the conversion would be “an

unnecessary expense.” Cole agreed,
saying that the switch to coeducation
had not worked out at Sewanee, al-
though there seemed to be general
satisfaction with the changes at the
“little Ivies,”

Lawrence, though, expressed a
strong hope for eventual coeduca-
tion at W&L, stating, “the school
Operates as an assimilator for stu-
dents entering society.” He felt,
therefore, that there was a “need for
a greater interchange between the
sexes” within a educational context.

Then Tompkins requested the par-
ents’ views on the incidents at W&L
last May following the Cambodian
intervention. One parent said she
thought that “students and faculty
handled it admirably,” while carry-
ing on the educational routine for
which the school was contracted.

Another said she thought “it was
silly to put a vote to students on
whether or not to take exams.”

Lawrence reiterated the detailed
developments of the strike actions

tinction between “closing” and “re-
directing” the university. He said of
those who voted for the referendum
—some wanted to lock the doors,
some wanted to go to the beach, the
most were in the middle.” Maybe
not all were truly concerned, he add-
ed, but “everyone was worried.”

Two gentlemen disagreed in their
view of the effect of the national stu-
dent peace efforts. The first parent
said that students had “tried to im-
press Congress by confronting the
university, and lost out both ways,’

The second parent suggested that
student activism had “served as a
catalyst in making the government
contemplate problems and actions
that may otherwise have been neg-
lected.”

Cole pointed out the lack of ten-
sion that had distinguished W&L’s
strike experience, probably due to

dents in a small college. The prob-
lem, he said, was that the president
of the university today is unable to
tend to student problems and simul-
taneously ‘be “dickering with parents
and legislatures for money.”

The panel agreed that the general
result of the May incidents at W&L
was to bring the university together.
“There are many straight conserva-
tive students who have refused to
listen to students with long hair, but
this has inyproved,” said Murray.

But the North Vietnamese will tell us
nothing. And it’s this silence that makes our
appeal more urgent.

For the families at home, there is no
word on who’s alive. Who’s dead. Or even
who's being held. There is nothing. Except
the anguish of not knowing.

Maybe you can —— this. By writing
to the one man who can change it: The Presi-

Ask him to release the names of prison-
ers, allow them to write to their families,

signed. And by the Istanbul resolution.

North Vietnamese leaders do care about
American public opinion. And if they think
they can gain something by bowing to it,
they will.

But one letter won’t do it. Or a thousand.
Maybe it will take millions. So we've got to
write now. All of us. And often.

Write a letter tonight. And send it to:

lic of Vietnam, Hanoi, North Vietnam.

On Marble Valley

BY DOUG BURTON

Mrs. Culbert McGay and Mrs.
John McGregor are even tempered
‘women, long time residents of Vir-
ginia. But they have a_ problem.
Among the public service projects
now before the Federal Power Com-
mission in Washington is a pumped
storage dam proposed for Marble
Valley, which is their home and the
home of 40 Virginia families now
threatened by the dam.

Their consternation began one
morning in June of 1968 when Vir-
ginia papers carried a story that
Virginia Electric Power Company
planned a $95 million project to
flood more than 1,800 acres in the
valley. Since then Mrs. McGay and
Mrs. McGregor have helped organize
the Save Marble Valley Association,
and now, with the aid of the Vir-
ginia Commission on Outdoor Re-
creation, the ladies may do just that.

Of course, the residents of Mar-
ble Valley could never have ac-
complished the protest had not their
concern been shared by numerous
conservation groups who doubt the
feasibility of the damsite as a future
recreational facility. Among those
concerned are the Environmental
Defense Fund, Sierra Club, Isaac
Walton League and Abe Fortas’ law
firm in Washington.

The latter has agreed to represent
the residents before the Federai
Power Commission.

The dam in question will not be
an ordinary hydroelectric facility
but a pumped-storage dam which
actually stores energy, in the form
of water, until it is needed. The ar-
rangemem calls for two dams and
two reservoirs — one high, one
low. By pumping from a lower re-
servoir to an upper reservoir during
off periods — at night and on week-
ends, VEPCO can, in a sense, charge
its battery, When maximum de-
mands for electricity are made dur-
ing the daytime, water in the up-
per reservoir is permitted to pass
through turbines to the lower re-
servoir, providing electricity for the
peak hours,

One of the points VEPCO makes
in arguing for the dam is that the
resulting reservoir would “create
recreational area which should bene-
fit not only the residents of the local
counties, but should attract many

Executive Committeemen give serious consideration to Monday’s meeting

Elections Statement Released By EC

BY RITA ENNIS

In light of the recent semi-contro-
versy concerning Freshman elections,
the Executive Committee released
the following statement in its Mon-
day night session:

“The Executive Committee recog-
nizes that there was a degree of lax-
ness in the supervision of the last
election, However, it is our feeling
that there was no breach of faith to
the student body on the part of any
member of the committee. We real-
ize that an air of impartiality should
surround all election proceedings;
that ballot boxes should be watched
carefully; that there should be no
campaigning around the polls. We
assure the university administration
that steps are being taken to make
sure that these conditions are main-
tained in all future elections.”

Other action taken by the EC fo-
cused primarily on the Honor Sys-
tem—establishing guidelines for
Honor violation investigations and
scheduling the distribution of Honor
System questionnaires.

Jim Slay proposed a set of in-
vestigation guidelines which includ-
ed three basic statements: 1) The
Honor System applies at all times;
in an investigation a student is as-
sumed to be aware of the fact and
will not be reminded; 2) During an
investigation, the accused has the
right to remain silent until the Stu-

dent Control Committee hearing; an
admission or denial of guilt is not to
be demanded; 3) The accused, while
he does not face his accuser, has the
right to know the exact information
before the Committee against him.
The Committee will protect his rights
by examining the accuser thor-
oughly.

The
mously.

Honor System questionnaires will
be distributed today through Friday
in the usual polling places. Phil
Thompson, in the Honor System
Study report, stated that a compila-
tion of results will be presented at
the next EC meeting.

Faculty Rebuffs IFC Plan;
Sets SAC Parietal Policy

BY SKIP PAUKERT

The faculty Monday evening pav-
ed the way for future changes in
parietal regulations, delegating the
full authority for such decisions into
the hands of the Student Affairs
Committee. The _ Interfraternity
Council's petition, calling for total
IFC authority to “establish all reg-
ulations regarding the visitation of
women in the fraternity houses,”
was defeated by the faculty.

The Student Affairs Committee is
jointly chaired by both students and
faculty members, and this body had
approved and recommended to the
faculty the defeated IFC petition.
The IFC proposal, presented at the
faculty meeting by IFC president
Doug Gossmann and Joe Garten,
had attempted to give the IFC Judi-
cial Board the sole right to review
and approve each fraternity’s parie-
tal plans, even though SAC would
have reserved the right to review any
violations of the regulations.

This was rejected in favor of the
following resolution: “That the fac-
ulty of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity delegate to the Student Af-
fairs Committee authority to es-

Highlight University Lecture Schedule This Week

Two prominent educators will
speak on campus tonight and tomor-
row, the first sponsored by the Uni-
versity Center of Virginia and the
philosophy department and the sec-
ond by the department of physics.
A third lecturer is scheduled for
Tuesday night.

Dr. Eugen Merzbacher, chair-
man of the division of natural sci-
ences at the University of North
Carolina, will speak on the topic of
“The Seeds of Destruction—Para-
doxes in Quantum Physics tonight
at 8 in New Science 305,

Dr. Charles Stevenson, Chairman
of the philosophy department at
University of Michigan, will address
himself to “Ethical Generalizations,
Explicit and Implicit” tomorrow at
1:30 in duPont 105.

A theoretical physicist whose ma-
jor interests have focused on appli-
cations of quantum mechanics to
atoms and nuclei, Dr. Merzbacher
earned his A.M. and Ph.D. degrees
at Harvard. The Berlin-born physi-
cist became the Kenan professor of
Physics at North Carolina in 1969,

Dr .Merzbacher has been associat-
ed with the Nuclear Structure Lab-
oratory at Duke University as we!!
as with the Oak Ridge Laboratory
as a summer Participant. He has au-
thored a textbook, entitled “Quan-
tum Physics,” which was originally
published in 1961 and has been en-
larged and revised for re-publication
this year.

Michael Mewshaw, author of the
novel Man in Motion, will give 4
reading Tuesday evening, November

17, in Payne 21. Appearing under
the auspices of the Seminars in Lit-
erature, Mr. Mewshaw received his
Ph.D. from the University of Vir-
ginia, has studied abroad on a Ful-
bright Grant, and is presently teach-
ing creative writing at the Univer-
sity of Massachusetts.

Governor Holton commented that
it was “good for students to think
freely, but they don't have to cut
the establishment off.”

In the informal 55 minute press
conference, Holton responded to
questions on the financing and integ-
ration of state supported institu-
tions, campus disturbances and eco-
logical problems. He declined to
comment upon the lack of help he
received from the Nixon admini-
stration during the campaign of Re-
publican Ray Garland for U.S. Sen-
ate.

Referring to a question on the
change in the code of conduct at the
University of Virginia, Holion re-
marked that although the students
have the right to a share in the rule-
making responsibility, “the rules
need to fit the mores of the society,”
He went on to note that the tax-
paying public has a “legitimate” in
terest in the formulation of the
codes of conduct at all state schools

Scholarship will be given on an
individual Virginia stu
denis demonstrating need by 1972,
weccording to Holion. Thus the state
government can provide “indirect”
help to private institutions in need
of scholarship funds, he said. In
general, Holton evaluated the new
ly approved Virginia Constitution as
1 “benefit” to all institutions of
higher education in the state

"When the

marked that a ramification of stu-
dent unrest was the resultant with-
drawal of promised contributions :o
institutions,

“Im trying now to patch up a
gramt which was withdrawn from
one of our institutions of higher
learning because of disturbances on
that campus last May. It will be per-
manently withdrawn if there is any
more violence.”

In the realm of integration the
Governor appraised his goal as the
realization of “unitary system” in
the state supported colleges and uni-
versities. He did not however think
“fair” HEW criticism of Virginia
schools’ integration practices. “The
HEW asked for a nickel, the college
gave a dime, and HEW came back

for a quarter,” he observed.

When asked about his position on
the proposed dam project on Craig
Creek near Roanoke, Holton felt it
justified at the present time because
of the need for a higher water level
downstream on the James River. He
noted that it was the cheapest and
most efficient of all proposed pro-
jects, but that he had not made the
final decision upon its implementa-
tion.

Concluding with a comment about
the status of the Republican Party
in Virginia, the Governor noted that
the GOP elected six out of 10 con-
gressmen in the recent elections.
“There are some great things that
have happened to the Republican
Party,” he concluded,

tablish policy and approve regula-
tions regarding the visitation of wo-
men in fraternity houses and Uni-
versity dormitories. The authority
of the Student Affairs Committee
will be exercised through review and
approval or rejection of decisions of
the Interfraternity Council Judicial
Board or the Student Control Com-
mittee on proposals submitted by in-
dividual fraternities or dormitory
residential units.”

Dean Lewis John emphasized that
the SAC jurisdiction applies to the
dormitory units, whose plans will go
through the Student Control Com-
mittee, as well as to the fraternities,
whose plans will go through the IFC
Judicial Board.

“The faculty didn’t insist on re-
taining the authority, but rather than
give total authority to the IFC, they
decided it would be better in the
long run for SAC to be responsible
for these matters,” said Dean John.
“Even though the IFC Judicial
Board has been very responsible, it
was felt that it would be advantage-
ous for parietals to be handled by a
cominuous official joint body of fac-
ulty and students, to review both
IFC and Student Control Committee
actions.”

With regard to other action at the
faculty meeting, Dean Pusey re-
affirmed the regulation of the Re-ad-
missions Committee that students in-
tending to graduate in June must be
enrolled in the Spring Term, even if
they already have the required cred-
its.

The Committee on Courses and
Degrees announced the initiation of
two new Art courses, both offering
internships at the Virginia Museum
of Fine Arts in Richmond.

Art 350, entitled Museum Meth-
ods, will entail the administration,
organization, acquisition, preserva-
tion, restoration, cataloging, exhibi-
tion, and other activities concerning
museums and their artifacts. The
course will be limited to junior and
senior art majors who carry a 3.0
GPR, along with 12 credits in an-
cient or modern languages, recom-
mendation of the department chair-
man, and an interview with the pro-
gram director of the museum.

Art 385 will be a museum apprer-
ticeship in preparation for a career
in museumology. The courses, open
by invitation only to one student
per year, will have as a prerequisite
Art 350 and the approval of both
Dr. Doyon of the Art Department
and the museum program director.

The faculty also voted to place a
student representative on the Com
mittee on Courses and Degrees.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
November 11, 1970

The Comedie Lexington And The Future Of Fine Arts

“The Troubs...
have been imprisoned,
artistically, in a degrading
and disgraceful
mausoleum.”
Editorial,
The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
October 3, 1967

Since these words were written in October
of 1967, not much has been done about the
state of the Troubadour’s “theatre.” Each pro-
duction which occurs at the red garage on the
corner of Main and Henry serves to make the
miracles the Troubadours work more com-
monplace, oddly enough. Last week's major
iniracle, for instance, was “Billy Budd”—an
exciting performance of an extremely diffi-
cult script.

Aside from the creativity of the direction
and the acting, we found the set to be the
heart of the miracle. Mr. Ken Barnes had no
mean task before him when he set out to
create a ship’s deck on a stage upon which
any self-respecting Sunday school teacher
would scoff at the idea of producing a Christ-
mas pageant. Mr. Barnes’ product was bril-
liant; yet as an onlooker in the theatre com-
mented Saturday night, the set was “O.K.”

So, we continue to have commonplace mir-
acles in a building which is more suited for
high school productions such as “Giget Goes
Hawaiian” than a college production such
as the one 650 people witnessed last week.

At this juncture, some will argue that the
Troubadour’s “theatre” has been renovated
adequately enough to suit the needs of the
department for the next decade. Perhaps this
is true. The “theatre” has a whole shop now
which was added off the left wing of the build-
ing. With this addition, the shop facilities for
the theatre have been rendered inadequate-—
before that, they were nil, If one cares to
browse around further in this grand tour of
Lexington’s own answer to the Comedie
Francaise, he will find about three feet of
space on stage right. That (in case you are
in doubt) is the stage right wing, featuring
enough space for one actor to turn around in
as long as he’s not wearing a bulky costume.

A walk to the front of the stage will yield
an enlightening discovery: ever since “The
Caucasian Chalk Circle” in 1967, there has
been an apron added to the stage to give the
players and the director more room in which
to work. Neat? Yes, except for reports of sev-
eral strained necks belonging to those who sit
in the first several rows of each production.
Intent on further exploration, the ambitious
will trek up the now non-squeaking (con-
crete) steps to the second floor where he
finds two (new) offices which give one the
impression that he has just entered the con-
fines of a get-rich-quick loan company lend-
ing up to $500 to vagrants. A (new) large
open area serves as the costume room; al-
though here again one needs a signpost of
some sort before this credibility gap can be

lessened.

An uneducated glimpse of the (new)
light booth reveals that the standard of in-
adequacy has not been overlooked here either.
In fact, anyone who has ever screwed in a
light bulb without help will be ready to at-
test to his befuddlement about lighting the
postage stamp stage.

And on the mad dash for the front door,
one should note the dramatic deception be-
tween the appearance of the (new) lobby and
the disappearance of the rest of the (new)
“theatre.”

After this tour of absurd proportions, we
come back to the question which has been out
of hand for about five years: why is Wash-
ington and Lee University allowing this “dis-
graceful mausoleum” to continue? Before
speculating about the answer to this ques-
tion, we cannot overlook the fact that in the
“Report of the Visiting Committee” made in
September of 1967, it was stated that the Uni-
versity is contemplating appropriation of
$3,500,000 for an “adequate auditorium and
‘little theatre.’ ”

Of course we realize full well that money
cannot be appropriated until it is received
through grants and gifts to the University.
Yet we wonder how it was decided that an
impressive gymnasium would be constructed
before a desparately needed library; that a
parking lot be built at Liberty Hall for non-
existant freshman cars—what we see are
patches of gravel where grass once grew ; and
finally that in planning for the University’s
future, the realm of dramatic art is associat-
ed with the need for an “auditorium” and is
characterized as “little.”

We are inclined to believe that the ap-
parant lassitude of the University towards
the construction of a more-than-adequate
theatre is created by several general attitudes.

(1) The Troubadours are thought of by
many to be more of a “clubby get-together”
drama group and less of a serious, dedicated
organization led by professionals.

(2) The Troubadours manage to do
“O.K.” in their present surroundings.

(3) Dramatic art is still conceived of as a
spin-off of the University more than it is re-
garded as a valuable asset.

(4) Educationally speaking, the University
does not appear to be in the fine arts market.

Frankly we see these qualified generaliza-
tions as a result of attitudes which were held
in the era before the advent of Professor Lee
Kahn's arrival in the mid 1960's. There can
be little dispute that Mr. Kahn’s brilliant di-
rection has done much for theatre at Wash-
ington and Lee. Yet one man can only do so
much, even with the valuable assistance of
Mr. and Mrs. Ken Barnes.

We strongly urge that the University and
the student Planning and Development Com-
mittee undertake a study of the following two
proposals,

@ The construction of an arena theatre
which can be converted with ease to the more
conventional proscenium arch, This could and
should be effected by no later than 1975, paral-
leling the construction of the library, A fune-
tional auditorium could be erected apart from
this theatre which would serve the needs of
not only university assemblies, but speaker
symposiums such as “Contact” and university
dances,

@ The creation of a School of Fine Arts
of a caliber which would place Washington
and Lee in the forefront of all colleges and
universities in Virginia for the undergradu-
ate training of individuals in the fine arts,
perhaps man’s highest form of communica-
tion,

Keeping in mind that a university may
lose its own educational purpose by striving
to accomplish many goals at once, we cannot
ignore the void which the present “theatre”
creates for the future of dramatic art and ul-
timately the fine arts at the University, To
our present knowledge, no college or univer-
sity in Virginia is widely known for its ex-
ceptional excellence in the fine arts. By 1980,
there could be one.

A Corollary Imperative For 1,400 Alumni

While we're on the subject of the Univer-
sity’s future, it seems to us that one area in
which the students have been woefully lax is
planning and development, The student Plan-
ning and Development Committee is estab-
lished as a yearly committee to aid the Uni-
versity in directing its future. Yet that or-
ganization has done little.

We believe that the committee could be
made much more effective if it were separated
into two standing committees: the Planning
Committee and the Development Committee,
The Planning Committee would work with
the University on studies of needs and time-
tables for construction; whereas the Develop-
ment Committee's sphere of concern would

he meeting the financial needs of the Univer-
sity so that it might realize its future,

More specifically, literature disseminated
from each of these committees to the student
body would aid in the education of the stu-
dents to the needs of the University. It seems
to us that many students leave the campus of
Washintgon and Lee thinking that the institu-
tion is “well off” financially, Perhaps this at-
titude is valid—as long as the University has
no plans to develop its land resources,

If Washington and Lee is to grow and if
the students, who will be the alumni of five
years from now, are to have a part in this
growth, the formation of these two commit-
tees ts imperative,

Letters To The Editor...

Jones Replies To Prater

About Freshman Elections

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

This letter is in reference to Mr.
Prater’s of last week, and the ac-
companying editorial in which I
and members of my fraternity were
accused of trying to influence the
freshman elections of October 22 by
politicing [sic] at the polls. Mr. Pra-
ter failed to disclose his source, but
I feel that all his righteous indigna-
tion could have been eased with a
little investigation on his part. I
personally do not remember saying
anything to a freshman such as the
quote that Prater gave. Nor do two
freshman, not pledges in my house,
who were talking with me the en-
tire hour and a half I was at the box.

The only possible explanation |
can give to Prater’s accusation is
that | might have made a similar re-
mark jin jest. However, I'm sure it
could have easily been recognized
as such, If it was said, it was an en-
tirely innocent joke which I cannot
even remember saying.

1 apologize for handling the poll-
ing box in what | now realize was a
too relaxed and casual manner. |
never thought of the implications of
jovial remarks which could be con-
strued to slander. The E.C. passed a
resolution Monday night which ac-
knowledged a somewhat loose at-
titude on our part in conducting the
polls, and it will not happen in the
future.

As to the editorial in The Ring-
tum Phi, | can only note the irony
in that it would mention “an eighth
grade homeroom election” in what
was obviously an eighth grade piece
of yellow journalism, Any journa-
list of merit knows the damage that
can be inflicted on a person’s reputa-
tion by quoting out of context and
with no investigation. Perhaps the
paper was trying to generate excite-
ment at the expense of others.

The most regrettable thing to
come from this furor is that it has
unjustly tainted the victory of the
three freshmen elected. They won
individually and on their own merit
without any assistance from me or
anyone else at the polls. It seems
that apology is in order from Mr.
Prater and the paper for over-react-
ing without any study or proper re-
search into the matter. Perhaps this
will serve as a lesson that will pr2-
vent the lapse of journalistic efforts
in the future.

Brymesser Defends PiKA

Position On Elections

To the Editor of The Ring-um Phi:

To begin with I must say that |
was turned right off by Alan Pra-
ter’s letter to the editor in the No-
vember 4, 1970 issue of The Ring-
tum Phi. Mr. Prater’s whole story
seems to be based on hearsay, ie.,
“what has been reported to me...”
and “I have been approached .. .”
He presents no solid facts to show
that “one fraternity is able to strong.
arm the election of representatives,”

In the first place, how could one
fraternity accomplish such a monu-
mental task? It might be conceiv-
able, by a far stretch of the imagina-
tion, to give a fraternity the power
to coerce each of its members of a
certain class to vote in a certain way
in their respective class elections;
but how could a fraternity force
anyone else to vote in a prescribed
manner? The idea is completely un-
founded. Where is the evidence?

Secondly, Mr. Prater does not pre-
sent any names to substantiate his
idea; because, he says, he was fe-
quested not to do so. Well, if Mr.
Prater is prepared to bring such a
serious accusation against a frater-
nity, and he certainly has, whether
intentionally or not, he should be
prepared to name names, Obviously,
he is in no position to do so or “the
several freshmen” also realize the
ridiculousness of his accusation and
do not want to be any part of a
smut campaign against a fraternity
or person

Thirdly, Mr. Prater suggests that
“the BE. C, were not the only persons
watching the polls during the run-

offs.” 1 would also like to suggest
this; but, not as Mr. Prater sug
gests, that members of Pi Kappa

Alpha were the only ones doing so
| would like to suggest that mem

bers of every fraternity, which had
pledges running for office, were also
watching the polls very closely.

Fourthly, if Mr. Prater checks
his statistics, he will find that at
least one of the gentlemen running
for office, Tom Faulkner, did re-
ceive a substantial lead in the pri-
mary. His election came as no great
surprise to those who saw these fi-
gures.

Therefore, no sarcastic slurs as to
the ability of the new freshman of-
ficers is needed, i.e., “Well, I sup-
pose much can be attributed to their
abilities—but then, these  abili-
Wh cia

Fifthly, if the rumored conversa-
tion between Mr. Jones and a cer-
tain unnamed freshman did take
place, it was unethical; BUT how
can this be offered as proof that the
entire Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity
was responsible for strong-arming
the election of their pledges as repre-
sentatives?

Finally, 1 would suggest that in
the future, Mr. Prater use facts as
facts and not hearsay and false ac-
cusations as a political springboard!

Howe Questions Arnold,

Calls For Objectivity

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

In response to Mr. Chuck Ar-
nold’s letter to the editor of Novem-
ber 4, 1970, I find occasion to ques-
tion a few of his points and recom-
mendations.

First, 1 question the existence of
“so many” real issues that face the
student body and the University.
Due to the fact that no examples of
such issues were given Mr. Arnold,
I shall go on to what he termed the
“Minor, irritating issues.”

‘Freshman/Sophomore PE, athle-
tic scholarships and University aid
to athletics are all long-standing ad-
ministrative policies. I feel quite cer-
tain that these issues have been de-
bated and questioned for years. Such
issues have died and been resurrect-
ed numerous times even in the one
year that I have been here. I also
wonder at how a school newspaper
would go about reporting such issues
as Freshman/Sophomore P.E. Sure-
ly, it is not news, as such.

Perhaps The Ring-tum Phi could
conduct an opinion poll covering a
cross-section of freshmen and sopho-
mores, asking whether or not these
students favor PE, I needn't even
suggest the outcome such a poll
would produce. (Admittedly, this is
an exaggeration; however, it serves
to clarify my point.)

I do agree with Mr. Arnold, how-
ever, On one point: the newspaper
should present unbiased reports on
issues of this University. That is a
fundamental rule in journalism,
though it is not always practiced by
The Ring-tum Phi.

With all due respect to Mr. Ar-
nold, | would be curious to know
what he considers to be the issues
here at W&L, and how he would at-
tempt to handle them as a news-
paper editor himself.

Stein Lauds ‘Institutions,’

Decries RAC Statements
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

There seems to be a very import-
ant question facing Washington and
Lee and all institutions of higher
learning today. Should a small mi-
nority of non-conformists abolish
the institutions upon which the uni-
versity is based? One such institu-
tion is the Honor System.

The Honor System has been ques-
tioned widely this year at Washing-
ton and Lee. One of these attacks
was circulated by the Revolutionary
Action Council. The letter is con-
cerned on one level with how best a
student may avoid a “bust.” On a
higher level, it is a direct attack on
Washington and Lee and its Honor
System by way of the “pig dorm
counselors.”

The letter encourages the accus-
ed to remain silent when offered the
ultimatum:

We have reliable information that

you have been smoking marijuana

in this room. If you admit it now
you will be brought before the

Student Control Committee. If

you deny it, you will be charged

with an honor violation.

It is evident that the accused has
either been smoking marijuana or
the has not. All he is asked to do is
to tell the truth. That is all the Hon-
or System requires of him in this
situation. If he is innocent, he has
no worry. If he is guilty, he must
suffer the consequences. Thus the ac-
cused have no right to remain sil-
ent.

If a person cannot conform to tell-
ing the truth when he is called upon,
he cannot be a productive part of
this campus, this society, or any
other society. Marijuana laws may
be wrong, but attacking them
through the Honor System and the
dorm counselors is even worse.

Usually I try to devote this column
to an at least halfway serious discus-
sion of a topical university question,
but the EC, the administration and
the Now Generation have all been
quiet lately, so there aren't any start-

about. (This isn’t all bad though. I’ve
often thought that the world would
be better off if there were no need!

Games In Newcomb Hall

BY BOB GILL

Those who complain that Wash-
ington and Lee course offerings just
don’t zero in on contemporary prob-
lems would do well to stop by New-
comb Hall any Monday or Wednes-
day night. Behind that crumbling fa-
cade, students of the departments of
politics, sociology and administra-
tion are attempting to come to grips
with that twentieth-century planner’s
nightmare, the American city.

The name of the game (some cai!
it Monopoly) is Envirometrics. Play-
ers in a hypothetical urban set-up
make fundamental decisions con-
cerning the political, economic and
(yes) social administration of their
laboratory city. Players are divided
into teams on the basis of function.
There are teams which act as the
Chairman and City Council, Fi-
nance Department, Public Works
and Safety Department, School De-
partment, Highway Department,

and Planning and Zoning Depart-
ment. As if this weren’t enough, most
teams are responsible for an econo-
mic sector in addition to their de-
partmental duties.

The computer serves as a deposi-
tory for statistics and simulates pos-
sible outside influences which may
affect decisions. For instance, the
School Board may be informed that
old PS 382 burned last night, and
the Highway Department may lose
an occasional bridge to hurricanes.
And then there’s the human factor.
Computers, after all, must be pro-
grammed—and certain of us have
experienced considerable malaise on
viewing the results of a misplaced
dash.

As the game continues, the need
for interaction among departments
becomes evident. To build a new
school, for instance, the School De-
partment must demand an appropria-

THE RING-TUM PHI

   
  

“i
) Markings.

  
 

BY ROBERT BAROODY

I had intended to fill this space
with several personal observations
on the “walking wounded”: our
youthful generation. An account of
how drugs, the war(s), Hendrix, Hef-
ner, Corvairs, and McDonald’s ham-
burgers—certain things mostly uni-
que to American culture—have
shocked, scarred, and fragmented
too many young bodies and souls.
This is an idea what I find simul-
taneously fascinating and disturbing.

But.

It is vital to our mental well-being
to balance occasionally the negative
with the positive. Recently some-
thing very good occurred in Ameri-
ca. This was, and will be the resur-
rection of Muhammad Ali.

Too much has been written about
Ali, the brilliant fighter. There is a
more interesting dimension to this
man; Ali, the American archetype.

Flashback with me to the middle
of the year 1966: a time when Eu-
gene McCarthy began to have sec-
ond thoughts about Vietnam; and
the intellectuals argued about the
obsolescence of the domino theory.
Well, who should come along
and say “I ain’t got no quarrel with
those Viet Congs”? That's right
sports fans, CAS-SEE-USH CLAY!

The liberals, if they ever talked
about the subject of prizefighting at
their cocktail parties, snickered, and
said “Here is this dumb Negro box-
er who somehow arrives at this con-
clusion; what does he know about
the enclave strategy? Tsk, tsk.
George (giggle), why (giggle) don’t
you buy Clay a subscription to The
New Republic, so at least (giggle)
the man can know what he’s talking
about’. Also: ‘He was a good nigger,

In Praise of Ali

Page 3

yeah; but a Muslim Champion!
Quick, bring on the rabbit . . . Cru-
sader Rabbit.’

In retrospect, I think that Ali, a
man who made his living by physi-
cally devastating other grown men,
who possessed an understanding
of life and death far deeper than
anybody would have guessed

Boxing is a brutal profession, yet
in a sense it is a very honest one.
The prizefighter meets his enemy
face to face; however intent upon
hurting his advesary, the boxer reco-
gnizes him as a talented human be-
ing. The “animals” simply do not ap-
proach the championship class. What
disgusted Ali about the army was
the utterly terrible prospect of hav-
ing to kill a man, and an unknown
man at that. There is some consider:
able difference between fighting and
murdering. Hence, a denial by Aii
of the basic American conception of
the enemy. “I ain't got no quarrel
with those Viet Congs.” This, of
course, was not the sole reason for
Ali’s persecution: his departure from
the sports hero stereotype; the hold-
ing of heretically unpopular religious
beliefs; even the clownish disposi-
tion; all these conspired against a
man destined to become a symbol of

the new America.

And now Muhammad Ali is back,
but he’s too damn quiet for my taste.
Is this strange demeanor a product
of maturity or a damaged spirit? The
former option must be our hope; the
latter is frightening. If a man of
Ali’s strength and purity of existence
can be broken by a diseased society,
then what hope is there for the new
niggers? How this country needs
whole men who are able to laugh at
this chaos of modern life.

Harriers Boast 7-3 Record

The W&L cross country team
topped off its 7-3 winning season
with a strong second place finish in
the State Small College Meet held
in last Friday’s drenching downpour
on the rain soaked course at Bridge-
water College.

Freshman Bill Kalal finished Ist for
the Generals and tenth overall at
28:21 in the frantic five-mile race
for the tape, with Co-captain Bill
Wilkinson and Freshman Tom
Young only 18 and 19 seconds be-
hind respectively. Junior Carter
Glass, Sophomore Bob Sherwood,
and Freshman Tim Kearney con-
stituted the General's second tight
group with only 13 seconds between
Glass and Kearney, followed less
than 35 seconds later by Freshman
Jim Horner and Co-captain Paul
Wilber.

The Generals were beaten only
by the powerful Bridgewater squad,

 

All sports events are posted on the
athletic board in front of the Co-op.

 

which edged the bulk of its runners
into the first seven places.

It should be noted that Bridge-
water does give athletic scholarships
to its runners, which may account
in part for its strength. Except for
Bridgewater, however, the Generals
literally ran away from Roanoke
College, Lynchburg College, Christo-
per Newport College, Madison Col-
lege, and most importantly, Eastern
Mennonite College, the first time in
11 years that W&L has defeated the
perennially formidable E.M.C. har-
riers.

his past weekend, the Generals
travelled to St. Louis for the C.A.C.
meet on a relatively flat course at
Washington University, where they
edged out Sewanee and soundly
trounced Southwestern for a third
place finish behind second place
Centre and favored Washington Uni-
versity.

LaRue’s Press Box

Leading the Generals, Co-captain
Bill Wilkinson captured the sixth
place individual award for his 22:15
time on the four-mile course, fo!-
lowed only 7 seconds later by Bill
Kalal, who earned the eighth place
individual award in this his very
first C.A.C. competition. Running
third for the Generals and 13th over-
all was Bob Sherwood, followed by
a tightly knit pack of Generals, Car-
ter Glass, Tom Young, Jim Horner,
and Co-captain Paul Wilber, for
18th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd places
respectively in the field of 35.

According to Co-captains Wilbur
and Wilkinson, the credit for the har-
riers’ unusual performance this year
can only go to an outstanding group
of freshmen, most of whom had been
experienced runners in high school
and all of whom worked with dogged
determination to develop their phy-
sical toughness and mental stamina.

two well-matched clubs will make

Dame and Texas A&M, will keep a
second straight outstanding LSU
squad from a New Year's Day con-
test.

Still another Southeastern Confer-
ence squad, Ole Miss, will make its
road trip to Houston and the Astro-
Bluebonnet Bowl to meet one of the
West's untried powers, Arizona State.
The Rebels, without star attraction
Super Archie, will probably take an
8-2 mark to the Dome.

And to go out on a limb, Syracuse
will go after San Diego State in the
Sun Bowl. An Aztec victory would
launch the California school into the
big time.

A couple of teams which could
figure somewhere in the mini-mini
bowls are Alabama, looking for its
umpteenth straight post-season clash,
Florida, Georgia Tech, Texas Tech,
Duke, and currently undefeated
Toledo.

Archie Who?

The man who until this past Sat-

the top contender for the Heisman

arm and dropped from the race. Who
will take his place? Woster Theis-

The generals felt the absence of
Bruce Green who injured his kid-
ney in the Sewanee game the week
before last. Green will be unable
to finish the season, but he has al-
ready compiled an impressive re-
cord . . . 28 receptions for 395
yards and 3 touchdowns.

Southwestern at Memphis clinch-
ed at least a tie for the CAC title
last week by romping over the deter-
mined but sluggish Washington and
Lee Generals, 42-14.

The Generals’ passing combina-
tion, Steve Fluharty and Steve Me-

haffey, continued their record-set-
ting pace while the rest of the of-
fense lacked the needed backup

punch, Fluharty will remain high
among the nation’s passers with his
18 of 34 attempts for 169 yards.
Mahaffey snared 13 of those aerials
for 104 yards.

The first quarter saw W&L on the
defense most of the time. Southwes-
tern scored first on a cheap flat pass
that went for 49 yards, with 6:18 re-
maining in the quarter. The P.A.T.
was true and Southwetsern was sit-
ting on a 7-0 lead.

But, as the second quarter open-
ed, George Harris intercepted a
stray pass and returned it to the
Southwestern 47. Succeeding on
many third down clutch situations,
the Generals drove to the seven yard
line, with a first and goal. The next
play was most likely the game’s turn-
ing point. Fluharty threw to a wide-
open Mahaffey for what seemed to
be the tying score, but an offensive
pass interference call nullified the
play. Downs then claimed the drive
on the 10. Southwestern turned about
face and scored only 30 seconds
later on an 87 yard pass and run.
The conversion made the score 14-0,
instead of the possible 7-7 tie.

Still in the second quarter, South-
western scored its third T.D. with
3:21 remaining in the half on an-
other long pass, this one of 38 yards.
The kick was good and the Generals
were further behind, 21-0. Yet, on
the kickoff, Mark Lane broke loose
for 31 yards to the Generals’ 49. In
only five plays, with Fluharty mak-

ing himself most of the drive, Doug
Gossmann plunged four yards for
W&L’'s first legal points. Doug
Ohase’s boot was good and the half
ran out to Southwestern’s lead, 21-7.

Receiving the opening kickoff, the
Generals drove 47 yards on the
ground and in the air to the South-
western 22. Fluhanty scrambled from
there out of the pocket on a pass
play and entered the end zone virtu-
ally untouched. Chase’s P.A.T. was
true and the Blue pulled a bit closer,
21-14.

That was the extent throughout of
W&L’s offensive show as Southwes-
tern took over and controlled the
ball over 75 per cent of the time.
Runs of one and 15 yards and a pass
of 15 concluded Southwestern’s and
the game’s total scoring. All the con-
versions were good and the score
ended 42-14.

This week, the Generals conclude
their season against Washington Uni-
versity, which is the only team that
can tie Southwestern University for
the Conference title. Game time is
2 p.m. at Wilson Field.

The Washington game will be ex-
tremely important as far as the

CAC’s are concerned, but in another
respect this game is even more im-
portant. It is the final game for ten
seniors.

Of the lower reservoir, he writes:
“The lower damsite touches the Na-
tional Forest and is only a short dis-
tance from Douthat State Park’s
lake and the new Gathright Dam
reservoir, not to mention scenic
Goshen Pass. To argue that this sec-
tion of the state needs more recrea-
tion facilities would be difficult.”

Lyle, along with many conserva-
tionists views with apprehension the
problem of drawdown in the lower
lake. “If VEPCO is required to aug-
ment downstream flow in summer,
there will be large areas of mudflats
visible during the peak recreation
season.”

Lyle feels that “the Valley in its
present condition abounds in wild-
life. Deer, bear, turkey, and trout.
Visitors are struck by its clear river,
stone fences, and lush fields.” This
opinion is also shared by Student
Body President Fran Lawrence,
head of W&L student efforts to fight
VEPCO.

Lawrence told the Ring-tum Phi
that if the project were to be success-
fully defeated, students and residents
of this area would have to reduce
the mounting drain on electrical
power. “The irony is,” Fran said,
“that while VEPCO screams for
more power, at the same time they
put up billboards encouraging peu
ple to air-condition their homes.”

University Announces
Agreement to Maintain

Exchange Program

Washington and Lee University
will participate again with seven ol-
her colleges (Davidson, Hampden-
Sydney, Hollins, Mary Baldwin,
Randolph-Macon, Randolph-Macon
Woman's, and Sweet Briar) in an ex-
change program during the 1971-72
academic year.

This program is designed primar-
ily for juniors. Exchanges shall or-
dinarily be for a full academic year,
but shorter periods may be consider-
ed if the calendars of the two schools
involved make this possible.

Additional information and cata
logues of the participating colleges
are available in the Office of the
Associate Dean of the College.

Applications are to be submitted
on or before February 10, 1971 to
the home institution of the student
who wishes to participate. The ap-
plication must indicate the student's
proposed course of study.

Charlie Byrd Quintet
At Openings Concert

(Continued from Page 1)
Aquarius” from “Hair,” the quin-
tet’s interpretative ability and techni-
cal virtuosity are consistently appar-
ent,

The quintet is composed of Char-
lie Byrd on an amplified 6-string gui-
tar and a classical guitar, his broth-
er Joe Byrd on electric bass, Mario
Darpino on flute and alto flute, Hal
Posey on flugelhorn and trumpet
and Bill Reichenbach on drums.

Long experience together that in-
cludes tours throughout the world
has made the quintet especially pro-
ficient at the organized improvisa-
tion particular to the jazz idiom.

Byrd, who studied with Segovia,
plays quite well. He has a fine and
firm technique. There are, however,
several guitarists around today that
play as well. His chief distinction is
that he and his group combine the
classical and jazz works on the same
program, and play each type of
music superbly.

lickets for Friday nights concert
are now on sale in the Co-op at the
price of $10 per couple. They will
also be sold at the door at the same
price. In addition, Dance Plans may
still be purchased for the rest of the
concert season at $35. Some four
more concerts are planned in addi-
tion to Byrd’s performance.

‘Patton’ Producer, VMI
Alumnus, Participates In
Founders’ Day Activities

Frank McCarthy, producer of the
widely-publicized recent movie “Pat-
ton,” is on hand for the Founders’
Day convocation at VMI today.

Virginia Military Institute cele-
brates its I3ist year today, tracing
its history back to November 11,
1838 when Cadet John B. Strange
relieved the arsenal guard and be-
came the first VMI sentry. The
school entered its first session with
a total enrollment of 23 cadets and a

faculty membership of two instruc-
tors.

The featured speaker at today’s 11
a.m. convocation, McCarthy is a
1933 graduate of VMI who went on
to receive his M.A. at the Univer-
sity of Virginia. Later he returned
to VMI for a time as an instructor
and tactical officer.

On entering the Army in 1940,
McCarthy served with another VMi
graduate, General of the Army
George C. Marshall as assistant sec-
retary to the Anmy’s general staff,
and later as secretary. During this
time, he rose through the ranks to
become a brigadier general in the
Army Reserve.

Following World War Il, McCar-
thy was appointed an executive and
producer with Twentieth Century-
Fox studios in 1948, a position he
has held in that company ever since.
In 1954, he was named an assistant
secretary in the Department of State
under Secretary of State James F.
Byrnes.

He retired from the Army in cere-
monies held at VMI in 1963.

The film “Patton” represents, ac-
cording to McCarthy, a long-held
desire to make a motion picture
about the famed general and the
Second World War.

and arrange through the appropriate
teams to buy land, develop utility
and highway service for it, and have
it zoned—all before the new school
can be built. Various teams jockey
for positions of influence and, as ‘n
any urban government situations,
some corruption develops.

Envirometrics as a system is still
in the developmental stage. Viewed
by many scholars as an attempt to
bring order out of an otherwise chao-
tic situation, its possibilities are vir-
tually limitless. It has drawn nation-
wide attention to both the problems
and the promise of the American
city. As John Chancellor of NBC
News said in a recent broadcast,
“This is not the city of the future,
but it’s a step in that direction. What
they hope to produce here is a uni-
fied theory of city technology.”

What Envirometrics is doing, then,
is highly important to us all. As
Chancellor says, “If they don’t do
it, or if somebody doesn’t do it, the
cities may stop working, and where
will urban America be then?”

On IFC

(Editor’s Note: “PinPoint” is a
column of news analysis and com-
mentary upon any event of signifi-
cance to the University. The opi-
nions expressed in this column do
not necessarily represent those of
the Ring-tum Phi.)

BY ROBERT LARUE
IFC Vice President

This article is a reply to Roy
Carlton’s statement in the PinPoint
of November 4 concerning the In-
terfraternity Council and the rush
system, I feel that Mr. Carlton mis-
construed several facts and showed
poor and premature judgment.

In the first place, Mr. Carlton
completely misses the main point of
the extended rush period. The pur-
pose of a longer rush is to give fresh-
men the opportunity to study more
fully the various fraternities. On
the other side, a longer rush will
also allow fraternity members a
closer scrutiny of prospective fresh-
men. Hopefully, this fuller acquaint-
ance between freshmen and upper-
classmen will prevent the mutual dis-
enchantment which tends to set in
later. The final result should thus
be a decline in deacivation.

Secondly, Mr. Carlton attacks the
IFC for its failure to come up with
an immediate study of the rush pro-
gram, labelling the IFC’s study “be-
lated and ineffectual.” I am
amazed that Mr. Carlton feels that
a committee can sit down and rap
idly determine the positive or nega-
tive aspects of any rush program.
A committee has been appointed io
study the merits and demerits of the
past rush system. Because of the
study's statistical nature, the final re-
port, which includes recommenda-
tions for certain changes, is not yet
fully finished. The committee is
studying in detail how many fresh-
men each house pledged during eaca
week of rush, in order to determine
an optimum length for the period.
Also under study are many rules and
regulations, particularly those per-
taining to contact between rushers
and rushees. Clearly, an in-depth
study is preferable to a superficial,
haphazard one,

Mr. Carlton's third error is in his
figures. His statement that 58% of
the freshman class pledged a frater
nity was drawn from a list compiled
the day freshmen turned in their pre-
ferential cards, Mr. Carlton was in
formed by the IFC that this was by
no means complete and that further
pledging would be forthcoming. A!
this writing, 64.7% of the freshman
class have pledged a fraternity
Since an additional 12% of those
freshmen who have not as yet pledg
ed have indicated a desire to go
through the deferred rush plan, it is
probable that the 64.7% figure will
increase. For that matter, more than
82% of those who signed for rush
have pledged. I also question Mr
Carlton's alleged “pessimistic pre
dictions” based on the rush figures
The IFC never attempted to make
an official prediction; since M

Committees Report To EC;

BY JOHN ROBINSON
News Editor

A review of courses may be on
the way. The Executive Committee
recommended that the Curriculum
Committee study the feasibility of
such a review at W&L. In other ac-
tion the EC heard reports from other
standing committees and suwhb-com-
mittees concerning their plans for
the future.

Lex McMillan represented the
Curriculum Committee Monday
night. Steve Clement recently resiga-
ed from the committee and MeMil-
lan has served as temporary chair-
man.

McMillan thought the proposed
review of courses should be aband-
oned because “I don't think the com-
mittee can do a decent job. We don't
have the nvanpower and there are
other things that we can do.”

Law Representative Jim Slay not-
ed that a review of courses has al
ready been carried out successfully
in the W&L Law School. Slay add-
ed that the review was based on a
plan used at Hampden-Sydney. The
EC recommended that McMillan in-
vestigate the Hampden-Sydney plan
and see if the committee could con-
duct a similar project.

McMillan went on to elaborate
about some of the projects the Cur-
riculum Committee is considering.
He noted that perhaps the interde-
partmental programs could be better
developed in the future. Also it is a
possibility that professors will not
know when a student is taking 1
course pass-fail if the registrar would
be the only person that would have

mittee is also investigating the idea
of expanding the curriculum in the
religion, fine arts and pre-law fields.
After hearing McMillan’s report
of planned action the EC appointed
him as permanent head of the com-
mittee. The vote was unanimous.

Matt Cole came before the EC
representing the Calyx. Cole submit-
ted a list of organizations whose pic-
tures and copy would be paid for
from the student body fund. The list
was approved unanimously.

In the past two weeks a typewriter
belonging to Lex McMillan was sto-
len from the EC Room in the Uni-
versity Center. McMillan is a work-
study student doing administrative
work for the EC. The EC voted 11-0
to allocate $50 to McMillan for in-
surance fees on the typewriter.

Dean William Pusey submitted a
letter to President Fran Lawrence
asking the EC to select a student to
fill the newly approved position on
the Courses and Degrees Committee.
The letter emphasized that the stu-
dent should be above average aca-
demically and interested in academic
affairs. Vice President Phil Thomp-
son recommended that applications
be sought from interested juniors to
fill this position. Thus, anyone meet-
ing the previously mentioned quali-
fications who can meet with the com-
mittee every Tuesday from 2:30-
4:00 p.m. should present an applica-
tion including their grade point ratio
to Rich Murray before Monday. All
applicants should attend the EC

On The Business Of W &L’s Future...

(Editor’s Note: The Ring-tum Phi has de-
voted its entire second page this week to a
revealing interview which was conducted on
October 12 with Mr. Farris Hotchkiss, Di-
rector of University Development, and Mr.
Sanford Doughty, Associate Director of Uni-
versity Development.

In concluding our four part series on the
future of small private colleges in the immedi-
ate area, ‘we hope that the reader will take
careful note of the problems which the Uni-
versity Development office faces for the 1970's,
Mr. Hotchkiss and Mr. Doughty discussed at
great length the University’s budget, the ef-
fects of the campus disturbance last May
upon alumni, the possibility of coeducation,
and, primarily, the University’s future.

We thank these gentlemen for their valu-
able time and patience in conducting this in-
terview. We urge your interest and ‘we invite
your comments.)

The Ring-tum Phi: I'd like to start with
some questions about development budget.
Has the budget for this year been cut at all,
and, if so, in what areas?

Farris Hotchkiss: Let me first answer that
with a disclaimer. First of all, I'll say no, The
budget has not been cut. Secondly, the real,
authoritative source for that is the treasurer,
and I hesitate to answer that question for
him, which is what I'd essentially be doing.
But let me just point out one thing here:
there are two ways to look at the answer.
One way would be to look at what is the re-
quested budget. In other words, let’s say your
department wants $50,000 more than you had
last year, and Mr. Whitehead and the trus-
tees who serve on the budget committee come
back after a while and say, “All we can do
next year is give you $10,000 more than we
gave you in prior years.”

Well, it all depends on how you look at it.
Is that a cut budget, or isn’t it? In absolute
terms, our budget is greater for next year by
a healthy amount than it was last year. We
have budgeted to spend $5.4 million for this
academic year. Last year, our budget was $5.2
million. So, in other words, we've increased
the budget around $200,000, or about five per
cent.

Now, it’s true that this is not as large a
planned budget increase as we have been
able to plan in some prior years. And that de-
finitely, beyond any shadow of doubt, reflects
the squeeze. There's no doubt about that.
But no, we haven't had to cut the budget

R-t Phi: Well, now, have any specific areas
or departments been cut in the sense of being
budgeted less this year than last?

Hotchkiss: That probably has happened,
though not so much from the standpoint of
our having to arbitrarily cut back, but any
kind of budget reflects current needs. Some
departments had bigger needs last year than
they do this year, so I think that if you take
department by department, you might find a
few who had, in total, a less amount of money
appropriated to them this year than they did
last year. But | think that this is a reflection
of some peak or very pressing needs that can
bulge a budget one year and are not there the
next. It is my understanding that in terms
of what I guess you could call “normaley”
there have been no normal budgetary cuts
Let's say you have the English department,
for example, which has no huge project going
on this year, and has to be told, “We're sorry,
but you're going to have to do without one
professor this year.”

Now, that’s the kind of budget cuts which
many colleges are having to make, and which
we've avoided, On the other hand, | know of
some departments which had to make some
purchases last year which are one-time ex
penses, and their budget is not as large this
coming year as it was last year, for that

reason

R+t Phi: Proceeding from that into de
velopment itself, last year, during May, we
had a little bit of trouble. Would you care to
put a figure on the amount of money that we
might have lost due to that?

Hotchkiss: No, it would be just imposs
ible. You have to ask yoursell, when you say
“lost,” over what period of time have you lost
it, if you lost it at all? For instance, | know of
a large gift
that he’

one man who was considering
to the
having second thoughts

Lniversity who says now

He hasn't said that

he won't give it to us, and | don't know i he

will or not. It goes back to the “whether he
wants to or not” idea. Another example: we
have received about four letters from persons
who say that they had us in their wills and
have taken us out. Whether it was for a dollar,
or a million, we have no way of knowing. We
have an idea it’s not a million, but whether it
be $5,000 or $15,000, we can’t know. So, all 1
can do is to deal in generalities, and my gen-
eral answer to this is: it has cost us money,
because it has—at least for the present—rais-
ed in the minds of many of the people who
support us, some reasonable doubts as to the
permanency of the situation here.

You know, generalities are always the
most dangerous things in the world, and are
always so unfair to their extremes. But I
would say, if I had to generalize, that our
family, so to speak, (a) thought that the
whole situation in May was handled well.
They were sorry it happened. But (b) they
don’t want it to happen again. In other words,
it falls in the category of “you had an unfor-
tunate thing happen. Since it happened, you
handled it all right. In fact, you handled it
better than all right. You did a good job. But
let’s not let it happen again.” Now, believe
me, that’s a generalization. | could quote you
chapter and verse of some notable exceptions.
But I'd like Sandy to get in on that, too, since
he’s been here long enough, and he’s gotten
some feel on the thing.

Sanford Doughty: | would say that it’s
dangerous to generalize for any one reason. I
am certain that in the minds of some indivi-
duals who may never say so to us, they were
hurt by the events of last May. But, they
might have been hurt by something else, too.
This we'll just never know, just what made
them decide. There are so many things which
can make a person decide not to make a gift,
and it’s usually not any one factor.

Ile may be upset because his son, or some
other alumnus’ son wasn't taken, or because
at the moment the market is down, and he’s

 

got a paper loss and doesn't want to give
right now, or because of what he thinks is a
tendency on the part of the faculty to be too
We don't know,

and I'd say that it is dangerous to over gen-

liberal or too conservative

eralize. Actually, | think there are statistics
to support the idea that, by and large, mat-
ters such as student dress and student hair
and student political action really had not had
any major effect on the matter of gifts to col-
leves

on the other hand, there isn't any doubt
but that the higher cost of everything we buy
has affected our ability to balance the budget
\lso, the mere fact that as the cost of living
goes up, and with teachers in great demand,
our salary scale for professors has to go up to
keep them happy. Otherwise, they can very
qptnie kly look around and pick an offer trom
another college, where they are willing to pay
a little more. We pay very well, and it also is
true that Lexington is a heck of a nice place to
live, with a number of advantages which tend

who cuts the grass more money, or else he'll
go to a plant over in Buena Vista.

R-t Phi: Is this increase in the budget due
to our ability to enlarge and include more, or
is it due to a lot of costs?

Doughty: | suspect that a great deal of it
is simply a matter of costs. I can’t speak with
authority on this, but my guess will be that
there has not been any significant reduction
of staff on the college payroll. The payroll
goes up as the standard of living increases.
We have to be competitive, to a certain ex-
tent. This is one thing on which you can gen-
eralize: that costs go up, and you have to
meet them.

But, as regards the school, I'm very opti-
mistic about the school’s future. Not only
Washington and Lee, I'm optimistic about
a kind of switch in direction in the whole stu-
dent population in colleges all across the
country. I feel that students have just about
had it, and they're going to try something
else.

Hotchkiss: | hope you're right.

R-t Phi: It would be correct to assume that
you've been queried quite a bit about what
changes student life has undergone?

Hotchkiss: Sure. You know, when you
talk about W&L,

class by ourselves. There's a lot expected

were something of a
of us other than delivering a good education
Referring again to the University “family,”
the expectations concerning this school, in
terms of what does and doesn't occur here, |
think run a great deal higher than they do at
others, Generally, speaking, we are not ex-
pected to deliver just English, math, history,
ete. There's much, much more expected of us
than that. I don’t mean to say that we're look
ed on as a “finishing school,” but to a certain
extent our alumni, the parents of the boys
here now, and others really do expect that the
product comes out with more than just a
sheepskin. The men are expected to learn
something of the totality of growing up

R-t Phi: What would be the attitude if
we had a totally revised honor system, a book
with lots of rules and guidelines? And if in
stitutions like W&L fraternities go?

Hotchkiss: Well, that’s a hard question to
answer, Of course, this is already happening
and we're already having to work around it
so it at least won't be a new job, If we wound
up with no personal code—and I believe very
trongly in the code—we'd be in troubk ;

R-t Phi: Getting back to just what you's
said, though, how do you say “We're just in
the education business” to the alumni and
other sources of funds?

Hotchkiss: You don’t wet around it, first
of all. You have to live with it, and the best

that vou can expect to do is to base our <« ‘

on the fact that what vou still do. vor at
probably doing better than any other com
prt ible in tittitton That doen't me int the re

revit to like if thetigl

 

You know, if you go out talking to alumni,
you'll find during the question-and-answer
period, rarely will anyone stand up and say,
“Just how good is our sociology depart-
ment?” Usually, they will ask the same sort
of questions that you have been asking: what
are student attitudes, how do the other alum-
ni feel, and so on,

R-t Phi: What are our prospects for long-
range fund raising?

Hotchkiss: | think those prospects will
continue to be quite good. However, if at that
time we have lost our great extra contribu-
tion, you should question whether we ought
to remain small and expensive.

R-t Phi: About the gymnasium
construction somewhat,
much more money do we need to finish it?

Hotchkiss: About $2 million.
R-t Phi: This is just something we'v«
heard, but following the resignation of Mr.

now that

has slowed how

Corrigan, were not the plans of the gym al
tered to fit his needs?

Hotchkiss: No, not at all. | can be unequi-
vocal about that, since the plans to the gym
were virtually finished before he even came
here. One thing | remember though: when he
got here, he saw the handball courts and the
squas courts and he thought they could be
combined, Now, Gene is very big on physical
therapy, and I remember he wanted that area
beefed up. What I'm getting at is there'd be
no way to read into his leaving the fact that
he wasn't satisfied with the physical structure
as planned,

R-t Phi: Do you have any funds to build
the library with yet?

Hotchkiss: About a million dollars

R-t Phi: Specifically for the library:

Hotchkiss: Yes.

R-t Phi: How much money do you think
youll need?

Hotchkiss: Well, it's just a guess right
now, but we've been looking at libraries and
thinking whether they are qualitatively and
the kind of

Hotchkiss: Here again, I'm not the best

hgure

Letters
To the Editor

_ Jones, Brymesser, Reply

To the Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

I would first like to apologize to
Mr. Craig Jones for any slur upon
his ethical standards. I would sec-
ondly like to apologize to the three
winners of the freshman elections.
1 would thirdly like to apologize to
Pi Kappa Alpha. I am not apologiz-
ing because my position has chang-
ed, but because it has been misunder-
stood.

My intent in writing the letter of
two weeks ago was not simply to
sling mud at a frat or at any par-
ticular person. It was intended as
an elucidation of what I felt to be a
disturbing situation. In doing so, I
presented the results of an informal
poll of freshmen. After Jones’ re-
mark was mentioned to me, I found
myself unable to glean information
by any means other than simply ask-
ing freshmen at random if they no-
ticed anything unusual during the
runoffs. This was accomplished by
simply asking someone (in the Co-
op, library, gym, etc.), “Aren't you
a freshman?”, etc. Unfortunately I
did not write down the names of the
people I polled. Perhaps this is not
what Mr. Jones calls “proper re-
search”, and perhaps it is what Mr.
Brymesser calls “hearsay,” mever-
theless it produced the surprising in
formation which I reported two
weeks ago. | will easily agree that
I may have overreacted in the man-
ner in which I brought the subject
to light, but then I think that Mr.
Brymesser and I have that in com-
mon.

Jones’ alleged remark, for ex-
ample, was quoted simply as an ex-
ample to support my point. It has

Qn in Nal ghana

been taken as a personal assault,
and I can readily see why. I am sin-
cere in saying that I did not intend
it as such. Just as Mr. Jones did not
intend to be serious when he made
the remark... .

I have been asked to name my
sources. After reading my second
paragraph you can see (as I'm sure
Mr. Brymesser will, to his ecstatic
glee) that I cannot. Mr. Jones, how-
ever, can. Not only did he make the
remark in question, but he has a
good idea of whom he said it to.
During the EC meeting of Novem-
ber 9, Tom Mays whispered to
Jones, “Do you have any idea who
you could possibly have made that
remark to?” Answer: “Yea, I think
it was Brian Howard.” That's right,
Mr. Jones. Now, I can readily ac-
cept that the remark was made ia
jest. I lived next door to Craig for
nine months last year and I know
that he likes to kid around a lot. I
am sure that the remark was intend-
ed to be humorous. But my concern
is that the remark was, in fact, taken
seriously, and could also have been
taken seriously by anyone within
earshot. It should not have been
said at all.

Now, as to Brymesser ...

First, | never contended that one
frat forced others to vote in a par-
ticular way. I said that it wielded a
strong, direct, influence in the elec-
tions. I maintain that.

Secondly, I have presented what
I feel is the most important name.
I sincerely hope he will not be
dumped upon simply because he was
the object of an unfortunate, ill-
timed jest.

Thirdly, I will agree, and many
people in the past two weeks have
told me, that members of PiKA were
not the only ones around the polls.
The EC also realized this, and pass-
ed a resolution of apology for its
laxness.

Fourthly, | have checked my stats
and found that Faulkner did have a

fairly large lead after the primaries.
I seem, however, to notice the lack
of a really substantial lead in the
other two cases. The remark about
the abilities of the winners was not
intended as a sarcastic slur, but
could have been read that way by
anyone looking for sarcasm.

Fifthly, I did not offer Mr. Jones’
remark as proof by itself of “strong-
anming.” It was merely an incident
paralleling the thesis of the letter.

Finally, | would suggest that in the
future Mr. Brymesser use facts as
constructive criticism, and not opi-
nioned frothings and false accusa-
tions as carefully aimed invectives.

I think that’s enough said. My
purpose was to draw something con-
structive out of an admittedly sticky,
heated situation. The EC embodied
that “something constructive” on
November 9.

About W&L’s Future...

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

The editorial seen in the Novem-
ber 11, 1970 issue of The Ring-tum
Phi—a deep, detailed, definite ex-
position of the plight of the Trouba-
dour Theatre, et. al.—is deserving of
visibly expressed reaction resulting
from the editorial’s energy and real-
ity.

A university of this size (approx.
1400), a university of this nature
(quiet, qua academic), and a univer-
sity of this calibre (7) now confronts
a growing paradox. As a private in-
stitution—dependent upon its alum-
ni and its recruiting propaganda—it
is forced to offer physical pleasures.
Thus, replacement of Doremus Gym-
nasium with something bigger and
better. And/or as a small, liberal
arts site of “higher learning”—faced
with an increase (hopefully) in in-
tellectuality—it should offer the pro-
per routes to assimilation of that in-
tellect with the arts and skills of the
“real world.” Thus, needs such as an

improved theatre, an expanded fine
arts program, increased publications,
etc., etc., etc., in addition to the ex-
tent facilities.

The individual who attends but a
single performance in the Trouba-
dour Theatre is forced to recognize
the limitations, imposed by the phy-
sical plant, upon the increasingly
creative art. The student, professor,
or administrator who has something
that he believes to be worthy of pub-
lic statement notes with dismay the
lack of media. The potential artist
(or merely the interested person)
who seeks the opportunity to develop
(or explore) his talent feels distant
from the university’s concern when
cramped in a small studio that is al-
most off-campus.

These examples are but slight rep-
resentations of the total needs, With-
in a year the student body will have
ample space to undertake physical
exercise—not to mention God's
green earth. There will be comfor-
table settings from which to observe
basketball, swimming, wrestling. And
yet the student will wait (at present
estimates) another ten years for the
now-needed library. He will wait
(there is no estimate) for an adequate
auditorium in which to hear guest
speakers, to participate in sympos-
iums. He may wait until Newcomb
Hall crumbles to have a satisfactory
(and safe) building to house the de-
partments of commerce and politics.

Still, the needs themselves are sec-
ondary, for they are the ends. The
means are essential to the attain-
ment of those things physical (yet, 1s
a result, intellectual); and, hence,
the more are primary. And suppos-
edly (or evidently—due to the obvi-
ous lacks) the means are unknown—
or unavailable.

And yet they are available for the
athletic plant.

Perhaps there is an excuse. Per-
haps the funds received in such large
amounts capable of providing a new

On The Honor System

BY ROBERT BAROODY

The following are simply “mark-
ings on honor.” Because my ap-
proach is mystical, wonderfully il-
logical, and impractical (what about
the alumni?), I have chosen to ex-
press these thoughts under numeri-
cal headings. The only thread con-
necting these headings is the word,
honor.

1) A basic idea. Honor, the word,
is often confused by W&L students
with The Honor System. To say that
an honor code exists is not to say
that there is honor.

2) The honor cycle. When man
realizes that his sense of honor has
become a code, then it is in trou-
‘ble; when honor is actually codified
and symtematized, it begins to die;
when people want to readjust the
code, it is dead.

3) How does one get to be honor-
able? Is there a systematic learning
process involved?; or rather is honor
gained in some sort of initiation-
event? Can honor be assumed? for
four years?

4) One can infer from Mr. Raetz’
late column (“Can you change
thonor?”) a liberal-conservative pola-
rity, in which a man of a certain
political and social leaning is less
likely to be “honorable.” Am I mis-
taken in this interpretation? In any
case, Mr. Raetz betrays his insen-
sitivity by continually stereotyping
a group of people as the “Now
Generation.”

5) Robert Graves defines honor as
“the sense of your correct relation-
ship to your immediate surround-
ings, including your fellow workers.
It’s your duty to your clan or crowd
if you belong to one.”

6) Honor, as a social value, has

Page 3

  

always been characteristic of men
living in a closed system, a carefully
structured society. Legends from the
Medieval era tell of a hero who
could posit any given situation or
personage within a black and white
value system. Robert E. Lee was one
of the last men in this country who
qualified as honorable within the
context of his society. The Confeder-
ate Camelot had been demolished
and its black and white (no pun)
value system was forever replaced
by “gray” variables,

7) At Freshman Camp, the EC
representative easily explained that
lying to a date was not a violation of
the honor code. Why not!? If a man
is encouraged to be im or ammoral
when concerned with such vital
things as love and sex, then what
good is an honor code? Is honor a
five-day-a-week proposition at W&L?

8) Why must an evaluation of
honor be a social one? Certainly we
live in a community; but we do not
behave as a community. It is at the
University, more than any other
place, where different ideas and con-
flicting indiivdual purposes are tol-
erated, indeed nourished.

9) The Honor System, as it now
exists, is nearly worthless and it
should be destroyed. All traces wip-
ed out. If, at a future date, students
realize a sense of community, then
let them set up their own honor code
as a means of articulating communal
ideals. Until this occasion, applicants
to W&L should be limited to men
who agree to adhere to their per-
sonal definitions of the words “gen-

tleman” and “honorable.” Intricate

machinery and checks of fear cannot
apply to honor; it must ultimately
depend upon personal integrity.

This type of thing ought to wait

other lists of All-Something teams

rated players.

The All-Brand X Team

Front Four manned by Jim Reily
and Ben Davidson on the ends and
Dick Arnt and Houston Antwine at
tackles. Reily has yet to catch th:
opposing quarterback behind the line
of scrimmage, and Davidson is of
one of the football’s hardest hitters,
especially when the man is down.
Doug Bufone, Myron Pottios and
Ted Hendricks hold down the line-
backing positions. Hendricks, known
as the “Mad Stork” during his col-
lege days at Miami of Florida, has
had the “mad” replaced with “bad”
by Baltimore fans.

But the gem of the team is the de-
fensive backfield. W. K. Hicks is
one of the greatest when it comes to
playing “Oops, I slipped” and Char-
lie Stucks is, well, Charlie Stucks.
Ricky Harris and Earsell Mackbee
complete the Foursome. Mackbee
was recently cut by Minnesota be-
cause of the clothes he wears.

But a team is not a true champion
without its specialists. The All-Brand
X placekicker is Lou “The Toeless”
Michaels, the punter is Donny An-
derson, and the punt return men ar>
Ricky Harris and Homer Jones. An-
derson leads the league in tackling
punt returner, thanks to a miniscule
34 yard average. Harris and Jones
are the perfect pair; the latter can
find more colorful ways to fumble,
while the former can find more ways
to go backwards, than anyone else in
the league.

That finalizes my All-Brand X
team, but if I left your favorite out,
don’t despair, because he's probably
not worth the recognition anyway.

Tarheels Topple
Ruggers, 10-3

The W&L rugby team closed out
its most successful season last week,
dropping a hard fought contest
the University of North Carolina A
team. The only other loss of the sea-
son came aaginst Virginia Tech in
the season opener.

The contest at Chapel Hill was
marred by the irresponsible absence
of some of the first string ruggers,
however, the reserves filled in ad-
mirably, and at the half the Tarheels
led by 10-3. During the second half
U.N.C. began to use its talent to
good effect and W&L was hard
pressed most of the period. Defea-
sive efforts by fullback Fred Fletch-
er and scrummers Charlie Brown
and George Gautsch saved the score
from being worse.

En route to their 5-2 season the
ruggers defeated Hampden-Sydney,
Lynchburg, University of North
Carolina, and in their biggest and
most impressive win over U.Va.

Season standouts were backs Chris
Murray, Tom Baker, and Dave Gu’
hrie. Standouts in the scrum includ-
ed captain Al GaNun, who played
with injuries most of the season,
Sandy Snead, and Charlie Ross. Also
of note was the kicking of Fletcher
who missed only three conversion at-
tempts during the whole season.

The spring rugby schedule will be-
gin March 7 when the team takes on
Duke and will include American
University, Georgetown, Princeton,
Univ. of North Carolina, Univ. of
Virginia, George Washington, Vir-
ginia Tech and conclude with the
famous Washington and Lee rugby
tournament featuring schools from
all along the East coast,

VMI Athletic Department
Not In Financial Crass

BY WALT BRANSFORD and
PALMER TRICE

As I perused last Wednesday’:
Richmond Times-Dispatch, I ran
across an article entitled “WMI Ath-
letics Near Financial Collapse.” The
first thing that I wondered was,
where was the famed Spirit of VMI?
After reading the article, I realized
that it had died a slow, but sure
death. If the Keydets esprit de corps
had whispered its swan song, how
long before Mom, apple pie, and
the girl you left behind would fol-
low? For the answer to this riddle,
I turned to VMI Athletic Director
Tom Joynes.

Mr. Joynes summed up the truth
in Mr. Lindquist’s claims in one
word: “fraud.” VMI athletics is not
about to fold. Although a $50,000
deficit is predicted for this year, the
program will continue to operate on
a Reserve Fund, that had been creat-
ed solely for such an occasion, At
the present moment, this fund con-
tains about $100,000.

The VMI athletic situation is this.
the school depends entirely on the
football program for the support of
the athletic department. Due to the
Keydets’ poor showing of late, this

support has been dwindling. While
the football is profitable, it still lacks
enough to pay for the rest of the
sports. The solution to these finan-
cial problems would apparently be a
winning football team. Then, why
don’t they fire Coach Vito Ragazzo?

This would not solve the prob-
lem. Ragazzo’s team participates in
a league which he, at present, is un-
prepared to cope with. At this time,
VMI offers far fewer football schol-
arships than any other school in the
Southern Conference. Ragazzo is
giving only 15 to 20 a year. He needs
30, but he lacks the needed finan-
cial support. Who should be giving
this support? The Sports Club, which
is a branch of the VMI Alumni As-
sociation. The infinite circle returns
to lack of support from the Old
Grads. Where is that famed Spirit
of VMI?

The purpose of this article was to
explain our neighbor’s economic
straits. They do not wish to de-em-
phasize their athletic program, yet
they lack the finances to continue it
at its present level for an extended
amount of time without more sup-
port. While UGF can extend their
deadline, Tom Joynes can’t. Support
your local VeeMees.

BY PETER JONES

The Washington and Lee Gen-
erals closed out a disappointing sea-
son last week by dropping their rain-
drenched finale, 17-13, to the Bears
of Washington University.

Despite the continued success of
the nationally ranked passing com-
bination, Steve Fluharty to Steve
Mahaffey, the Generals followed
with plenty of the mistakes that have

though, Washington cranked up an
offensive that began on their own
25 yard line after a punt. With most
of the yardage gained on the ground
and on costly W&L penalties, they
moved to a first and goal on the
five. It took four attempts from that
spot to overcome a determined Gen-
eral defense. The score came from
one yard out with 11:17 left in the
first half and the PAT gave Washing-

their composure on the sloppy field
as they next generated a drive from
the Washington 37 after a_ short
punt. Steve Mahaffey caught half of
his total receptions on this drive,
the final one down to the one yard
line. JoJo Martin plunged for the
score. Doug Chase’s kick was true
and the score evened, 7-7, at half
time.

W&L received the opening kick-
off and moved with minimal pro-

ditions. After a punt, Washington
countered with a sustained drive that
almost made one doubt the muddy
field could hamper any type of of
fensive. After only 3 minutes of
play, Washington had penetrated to
the Blue 11. A stiff defense forced
a field goal attempt of 30 yards,
which fell short and wide. The first

Who Said Sure Bets Never Lose?

\nother weekend of football has passed,
and there are some of us who bet on the
games that are less than happy with the re-
sults. Take me, Seeing the
chance to make a big killing this weekend, |
put together all my resourcefullness and came
up with some sure bets: UCLA over Wash-
ington, Auburn over Georgia, Stanford over

for instance.

\ir Force, and Oregon over Army. Nice gape.
[went O for 4, lost all my money and my con-
fidence besides. Actually, I can do without
the confidence, but not having the money
bothers me a little.

The Heisman Trophy race appears to be a
runaway. That is, every time someone is seri-
ously considered as a candidate, he appears to
run away from it. Manning, the pre-season
favorite, didn’t look too sharp the first half of
the season, losing to Southern Miss. Still wor-
ried about receiving the trophy, Archie left no
doubt about his feelings toward it by inten-
tionally breaking his arm. This seemed to
leave Jim Plunkett in the forefront, but Plun
kett, realizing what Manning was trying to
do to him quickly retaliated by throwing the
\ir Force game last Saturday. Steve Worster
of Texas seems (incredulously) to actually
want to win the damn thing, but reliable
sources report no—he’s just waiting until the
‘Texas-Arkansas game so he can blow it, when
it really counts. Notre Dame’s Theisman is
planning to give away the LSU game the
Saline day.

So who is left? There are a few others (not
to be named here) who would have a good
chance at the top prize, but any player good
enough to be considered will surely have
enough class to avoid it, no matter how bad
he has to play. In the final voting the Heis
man Trophy will go to Fred Bartowski, an

State. Next thing you know he'll want to ap-

unsuspecting 2nd_ string for Idaho
pear on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Fred
always was sort of a loser.

Only one thing could stop Fred from win-
ning the trophy—my betting that he could.

Congratulations go to George Blanda, for
pulling out another game in the clutch, and to
Ron Johnson for holding his arms up in the
air five yards from the end zone. To Blanda
goes a new football, and to Johnson goes a
bun and some mustard.

Jazz followers unfamiliar with
Charlie Byrd were pleasantly sur-
prised last Friday night when the
Charlie Byrd Quintet displayed the
subtle techniques of Brazilian folk,
light jazz, classical guitar and per-
sonal inyprovization that has carried
the group across five continents.
Among the oferings were personaliz-
ed versions of “Hey Jude,” “Aquari-
us” and a roguish parody of “The
Battle Hymn of the Republic.”

During the intermission some of
the musicians talked informally with
The Ring-tum Phi about the current
of pop rock today.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Charlie Byrd: Jazz In “Progress

Byrd, like jazzmen everywhere,
warms to hear the sound of brass in
contemporary rock groups like Chic-
ago and Blood, Sweat and Tears. “I
like the groups with the horns,” said
the man responsible for introducing
Bosa Nova to the states in 1961.”
Guitar groups tend to get muddy, al-
though the Beatles’ guitars usually
sound pretty good. I like very much
their tunes.”

Billy Reichenbach, Charlie’s_tal-
ented drummer for nine years agreed
but added, “Their (the Beatles) tunes
are very pleasant to hear, but way
down deep | think somebody else
wrote them.”

Hearing this, Byrd said, ‘Well,
they said the same thing about Benny
Goodman.”

Reichenbach went on to say that
modern rock has evolved much as
jazz evolved in the 20's. “What hap-
pened was a bunch of very young
people who didn’t have much musi-
cal intelligence got together and al-
most created a new style of music,
but now rock, like jazz, has gone
into improvisation. Maybe in a gen-
eration you won't be able to tell the
two apart... . A lot of drum sets
and guitars are going up into the
attic because Chicago is playing
stuff the kid on the corner can’t
play. That's why the kid on the
corner didn’t play jazz. —

“We have discovered how primi-
tive Dixie Land jazz was in the
twenties. Well, rock in the sixties 1s
the same go around. Listening to
some of the groups is like hearing a
dog getting beat with a belt... But
I think a lot of today’s music is very
exciting.”

Mario Darpino, the group's flut-
ist, finds hard rock far distant from
the jazz diet he cut his teeth on as a
youngster, playing in bars in Hup-
percup, New York, yet he does not
think of jazz as a fixed musical me-
dium. He said the quintet’s pre-
occupation with jazz was a “progres-
sion” not a “retrogression” to an
earlier period.

All of the musicians expressed
their disappointment at the noise of
the crowd in Doremus, especially
during Byrd’s interlude of classical
guitar. But as Byrd's brother Joe
said, “the group has been together
long enough to know what to expect
from the audience, and when to ex-
pect it.” “At least,” he said, “the
crowd wasn't hostile.”

Recruitment Shapes Up

(Continued from Page 1)

new organization is to see high
school students during Thanksgiving
and Christmas vacations. Steve Rob
inson referred to the direct correla-
tion between personal visits and in-
creased admissions. A large percen-
tage of boys come to W&L after
meeting someone in an interview.
The Student Recruitment Commit-
tee feels that it can help interview
prospective students that the Ad-
mission Office cannot interview due
to its manpower limitations.

When the Admission Office is
shorthanded, the committee helps

show high school men around camp-
us. During the spring months the
committee will try to get accepted
students to come stay at WAL for a
couple of days.

All together committee members
plan to make 100-150 visits for the
purpose of student recruitment. At
their own expense these men hope
to talk personally with over 400
prospective students.

facility are given with a stipulation
of their usage. Perhaps there are
wealthy alumni more concerned with
the gridiron than with the mind.
Still, they do not demand athletic
scholarships. And the value of he
new gymnasium in comparison to the
needed library, the needed theatre,
the needed fine arts expansion, the
needed publications, loses signific-
ance.

It seems that the writer of a let-

“Wisdom In Humor”:
Pattables’ Art Is

More Than Voyeurism
(Continued from Page 1)

for “quilting”. The method is relat-
ed indeed to the folk art of quilting
practiced in our Appalachians, with
the exception that this use of trap-
unto results in realistic pictures
rather than the abstract patterns
found in quilts. The way artist Mor-
rison has used the age-old folk art
has an amusing twist in itself. While
the makers of quilts unconsciously
make “modern” abstract designs,
this most modern artist has playfully
reversed this most suitable of meth-
ods for abstract patterns by using
it to picture the most ancient and
most traditional of subjects in art—
the human figure. As if to com-
pound the amusing irony of revers-
ing the abstract-realistic roles, the
work is mounted in window frames
and door frames instead of in pic-
ture frames. Picture frames remove
the work of art from its immediate
surroundings, giving it a world of its
own, but the door and window
frames insist on relating the work to
this world. By observing these nudes
through a door or window the ob-
server becomes a voyeur rather than
a gallery visitor.

All of a sudden this house of fun
compels us to our first serious
thought—is the traditional show of
academic nudes nothing more than
sophisticated voyeurism? From this,
more serious questions about art
come tumbling into our mind. There
is more wisdom in humor than can
be found in much of our serious
statements.

a Flubarty pass and returned it to
the 24 of the Generals. On the very
next play an off-tackle slant went
for the score. The conversion was
good and the score stood 17-7, the
Generals still behind.

Near the end of the game a fresh-
man split end, Rick Romanelli, was
substituted for Mahaffey. With a
few receptions, Romanelli helped
carry the team to the Washington
18 with only 3:30 left in the game.
The next play was the score, an aer-
ial to Romanelli in the end zone. The
conversion attempt failed though
and moments later the season ended
with a 17-13 loss.

Outstanding performances in this
game, and over the season, are num-
erous. It would be unfair to cite
just a few. The failure of the offense
to t'ossom until late in the season
accounts for the Generals’ slow
start, and a few ill-timed mistakes
have hurt a team, that, statistically
appears potent. The potential is
there, and as Howard Cosell would
say, maybe next year.

Carlton did not disclose his source,
one must assume that his estimates
are merely personal conjectures.
Whatever the case, the quality of a
fraternity system is not necessarily
affected by percentage and numbers.

Finally, Mr. Carlton’s harangue
lacked a positive approach to the
problem. He never suggested a con-
structive alternative to the extended
rush system; he chose merely to
criticize it. Admittedly, this year's
rush plan had defects, but the plan
was never considered to be ideal.
After all, no new system is com-

at Washington and Lee University.

The artists—Mary Goslen. Vir-
ginia Ingram, Ann Carter Pollard.
Susan Moore, Anne Kesler Shields
and Martha Dunigan—have exhibit-
ed as a group and individually
throughout the United States and in
Parrope.

Their prints, all originals, are in
a wide variety of graphic media
cover a broad range of subject mat
ters, and are executed in styles from
realistic to abstract.

All six exhibitors majored in art
and printmaking in college and all
currently maintain art studios. Four
have earned their masiers degrees in
fine arts: three teach art as well, and
one isa designer

fhe prints, which will be avail-
able for purchase during the exhib

Weinglass, 36, is a Newark, N. J.,
lawyer whose biography declares:
“His roster of clients reads like a
“Who's Who in the New Radical

conspirators, he has defended Negro
playwright LeRoi Jones, SDS leader
Tom Hayden, and “The Free Peo-

Luce is a candidate for the Ph.D.
degree in political science at Yale,
and has three books to his credit,
“Road to Revolution,” with half a
million copies in print, “The New

Washington and Lee’s Student
Body Executive Committee discuss-
ed the formation of a new joint
student-faculty University Council
and stressed procedural aspects of
the new independent exam schedule
during the course of its meetings on
November 23 and November 30.

Representatives of the Faculty and
Student Body Executive Committees
have been meeting for the past six
weeks on the University Council
question. The plan calls for further
involvement of the students in the
University governmental processes.

The joint proposal calls for the
formation of a council consisting of
12 students, 12 faculty members, the
President of the University, the
Dean of the College, the Dean of
the Law School, the Dean of Com-
merce, Economics, and Politics, the
Dean of Students, and the Presi-
dent of the Student Body.

According to plan, the council
would, as an advisory group, dis-
cuss and debate university business,
review and originate recommenda-
tions to the administration, faculty
and student government, serve as an
emergency forum for the exchange
of ideas on critical issues before the
University, and serve as the ultimate
authority over student affairs.

The proposed committee would
not have jurisdiction over the Honor
System or curricular affairs.

Plans call for monthly meetings
prior to faculty meetings, or at such
other times as requested by the
President of the University, the fac-
ulty, or a majority of Council mem-
bers. The council would have the

Mary Baldwin Choir And

power to initiate new proposals for
study by administration, faculty or
student government, serve as an
agent for both receiving reports
from and determining policy for the
Student Affairs Committee, and to
review the reports of faculty com-
mittees to the faculty as a whole,
making only recommendations on
the subject of the report.

At the EC meeting of November
23, the proposal passed earlier by
the Faculty EC was discussed, and
passed by a unanimous vote of 8-0.
Law representative Jim Slay and
freshman committeeman Robert
Johnson were absent.

The faculty will vote on the pro-
posal at its meeting on December 7,
if passed, the Council could be im-
plemented in mid-January and meet-
ings could begin in February.

In other actions prior to the
Thanksgiving recess, the EC for-
mulated plans for a teacher evalua-
tion survey to be led by the Uni-
versity Federation in March. Pre-
liminary plans call for individual
students to evaluate their professors
on a scale of 1 to 5 in 12 different
categories. Knowledge of material,
availability to students, and grading
practices are but a few of the cate-
gories being considered.

Vice President Thompson report-
ed on the results of a poll under-
taken by the sub-committee on the
honor system. 337 questionnaires
were returned. Although the opi-
nions of only one quarter of the
Student Body were evaluated, pre-
liminary trends seem to favor tight-
er delineation of the code, continua-

Glee Club Give Concert

On Sunday, Decenrvber 6, 1970,
The Choir of Mary Baldwin College
and the Washington and Lee Glee
Club will present an evening of
choral music in Lee Chapel. The
hour is 8 o'clock.

This marks the first of several con-
certs planned between these two
groups. There have been, and will
be, regular rehearsals together, so
that the performances can be more
finished events than is ordinarily
possible with one rehearsal on the
day of performance.

The mixed chorus will sing Part
| of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana.
Gordon Page, director of the Mary
Baldwin Choir, will conduct. The
piano duet accompaniment will be
provided by J. T. Cook, director of
the WAL Glee Club, and Richard
Webb, regular accompanist of the
Glee Club.

The Carmina Burana (Songs from
Beurén) are a group of Goliard
songs discovered in the Bavarian
monastery at Benedictbeuren. Dat-
ing from the 13th century, these

 

Luce.

poems celebrate the bohemian char-
acter of the lives developed by these
wandering “dropouts” of the Middle
Ages. Orff has collected a number
of these poems into a cantata, realiz-
ing their directness in fresh, vigorous
musical texture.

Notice

Philip Cho, tenor, will sing at the
second concert of the Rockbridge
Concert Theater Series tonight a:
Jackson Memorial Hall, VMI, at
8:15 p.m.

His program includes songs by
Handel, Beethoven, Strauss, Dupare,
Vaughan Williams, Frank Bridge,
and several Korean folk songs, and
he will sing arias from Mozart's
“Don Giovanni” and Puccini's “La
Boheme.”

Student memberships for the
Series are still available at the Book-
store for $7. Two concerts in the
Series still remain: the Preservation
Hall Jazz Band on Feb. 18 and th:
New York Pro Musica on April 26.

 

Leonard Wecinglass, lawyer for the Chicago Fight Trial, will debate Vir.

tion of the closed trial system, and
retention of the absolute penalty.

Thompson urged that the EC dis-
cuss the results of the poll and that
the Honor System must change with
public opinion of a given student
generation serving as a basis.

Bruce Madison was appointed as
the first student representative to
the Committee on Courses and De-
grees, during an Executive Sess :.

At the November 30 meeting the
EC heard a report from Henry Har-
key, Chairman of the Financial Re-
lations Committee. Harkey reported
a 200% increase in the number and
size of bad checks over a compar-
able time last year. The EC remind-
ed the Student Body as a whole that
cashing is a privilege and that stu-
dents should be more careful in the
cashing of checks.

Clarifications were made on pro-
cedures for the independent exam
schedule. Each department will have
a distribution point where exams

U G
IN JOINT

On University Council

BY JOE TOMPKINS

There is a proposal now pending
which will be considered by the fac-
ulty at its meeting next Monday.
The proposal has been approved by
a unanimous vote of both the Fac-
ulty Executive Committee and the
Student Executive Commitice.

A University Council—twelve stu-
dents, twelve faculty members, four
deans, and the Presidents of the
University and the student body—is
what is being proposed, and | can
say with little hesitation that if this
Council comes into being, it will be
the most important thing that has
been accomplished during my four
years here, and one of the most
significant events in the history of
this university.

As I see it, the establishment of
this Council would be one more step
in the direction of making Washing-
ton and Lee a real learning com-
munity—a very significant step, al-
though by no means the ultimate
one. In essence, what this proposal
indicates is the mutual willingness of
students, faculty, and administra-
tors to meet as a group, to listen to
one another, to reason together—
actions which, it seems to me, can
have nothing other than beneficial
results.

There is a degree of uncertainty in
moving to create a University Coun-
cil, for there is no past or present-
day model we can observe. Hypothe-
tical questions concerning the opera-
tion of the Council have been and
should be raised. Some can be an-
swered with assuredness, bul many
call for prognostication and specula-
tion, making clear-out answers im-
possible. | have been with this pro-
posal since its beginning, I under-
stand its purpose, and I have a clear
sense of its potential. Yet I can of-
fer no promises. I can only siate
what I believe to be true.

I believe that a University Coun-
cil as proposed is both desirable and
feasible. | believe that students, fac-
ulty, and administrators can meet
and discuss frankly the issues which
concern the universily community
I think such a growp can be repre-
sentative of the different elements of
the community and make decisions
which are in the best interests of the
community

Whether or not the University
Couneil would have any real pewer
is Not the most important thing in
my mind. I hope and believe that the
Council would gain the respeci of
the members of the commufily as a
responsive, responsible body, so that
it would retain a power of persua

sion in the conduct of university
business
However, whal concerns me the

i Un
versity Council coukd have on the
attitude of the menvbers of the Un
versity toward the decision-makins
process within the University. By
having student input, real input in
stead of incidenial participation, and
open imMleraction between students
amd faculty and administration. |
have no doubt that there would be

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

December

2, 1970

A Laudatory Philippic Upon University Council’s Potential

Mr. Joe Tompkins’ comments on the pro-
posed University Council in our “PinPoint”
column this week are perhaps the most idealis-
tically judicious assessment one could make
of the Council’s potential as a forum for dis-
cussion between students, faculty and admin-
istration.

“The Executive Committee of the Faculty
(by unanimous vote of the seven members
present) and the Executive Committee of the
Student Body recommend the establishment
of a University Council to consist of twelve
students, twelve faculty members, the Presi-
dent of the University, the Dean of the Col-
lege, the Dean of the Law School, the Dean
of the School of Commerce, Economics, and
Politics, the Dean of Students, and the Presi-
dent of the Student Body.

“The Council would

“(1) discuss and debate University
business providing an advisory
group representative of the Uni-
versity community ;
review and originate recommen-
dations to the administration, fa-
culty, and student government;
meet, in an emergency, as a for-
um for the exchange of ideas on
critical issues pending before the
community ; and
exercise ultimate authority and
supervision over student affairs.
The Council would possess jur-
isdiction over the honor system.

“To accomplish these ends the University
council would

“(1) meet regularly before each month-
ly faculty meeting and at such
other times as requested by the
President of the University, the
faculty, or a majority of the
Council members ;
initiate new proposals for study
by the administration, faculty, or
student government ;

“(3) function as the faculty at its meet-
ings now functions in receiving
reports from and determining pol-
icy for the SAC; and

review any faculty committee's
report to the faculty and, make
its own recommendations con-
cerning the subject of that report.
The Council could not amend or
veto the original report or in any
way delay the faculty's considera-
tion of it.

(The text of this proposal was altered
somewhat by the Faculty Executive Commit-
tee Monday night in a meeting which occur-
red after an assembly of the Faculty Discus-
sion Club, The substance of the proposal is in
no way altered ; the changes made in the text
were solely for the sake of clarity.)

Sait

The hopes which Mr, Tompkins expresses
in his “PinPoint” column are ours, idealisti-
cally. We see the potential value of such a

“(4)

“(2)

“(4)

University Council to be that it has no power
except over student affairs. Thus it remains
above the final political considerations of a
particular question and free to promote an
exchange of ideas between the three most 1m-
portant segments of the community.

So much for idealism. There are a few
murky realities which darken our rose-color-
ed glasses. Take for instance the fact that no
demand came from the student body as a
whole that a University Council such as the
one proposed above be established.

The possibility for student “input,” as Mr.
Tompkins terms it, is present in the proposed
University Council. But we wonder how
many students will become truly involved in
the future of the University by the mere crea-
tion of a Council. We can almost readily ima-
gine the following scene in the environs of
the colonnade as this newspaper is read this
afternoon :

Student A: Hmm. Did you read about this
University Council thing in the paper?

Student B: What paper?

A: The newspaper.

B: Oh, Where is it?

A: What?

B: The council or whatever you said. At
Yale?

A: Yale? No, here.

B: W&L made The Washington Post?

A: No, The Ring-tum Phi.

B: Oh. Well, what's so great about that?

A: Who said it was so great? We always
are in the Phi.

B: No, no, no. This committee you were
just talking about.

A: The coalition?

B: Don’t ask me—you were the one that
started it!

A: Started what?

B: The whole argument about the caucus.

A: What caucus?

B: You know, that . . . convocation.

A: Oh, you mean the convention.

B: I suppose.

A: Well...
about it?

B: I don’t know anything about it. You're
the one who knows about it.

A: O.K., O.K! First of all, it’s in 1972

B: The convention?

A: The convention. It’s called a “mock”
convention because it’s supposed to be fake.

B: Do you believe everything you read?
In the paper?

A: Well, yes...

B: Do you realize they already had the
fake council in 1968? I was there.

A: Well, then—why did you bring all this
up to begin with?

what do you want to know

B: I don’t know, but did you see where the
Redskins blew another one?

Perhaps we have been pragmatically judi
cious to the extreme. Yet we cannot ignore
the possibility that in hoping to bring the
blinding light of communication to an other
wise silent student community, many men at
W&L will become discouraged when the best
they can possibly aspire to arouse is a flicker
in the darkness.

A Mathematics Lesson From Mr. Harkey & Co.

It would seem that the faculty was appar-
ently too hasty in instituting the new curri-
culum for this year—at least in one respect.
They had not foreseen the need for a required
course in money management with special
emphasis upon “checkbook balancing for the
college student,”

Mr. Henry Harkey, chairman of the Cold
Check Committee, was not being an alarm-
ist when he reported to the Executive Com-
mittee Monday evening that the Cold Check
Committee had handled approximately a
200% increase from last year in the number
and amount of bad checks during the first ten
weeks of the school year, The cold checks
have bounced their way into Mr, Harkey’s
and his committee's hands at the average rate
of $50 a week. And the major reason for these
returned checks is “insufficient funds,” ac-
cording to Mr. Harkey.

Perhaps “inability to substract two from
would be a better term for it

two” Is there

something in the air around Lexington thi

year that creates a drowsiness when one be-
gins to substract the amount of a $15 check
from one’s previous balance of $2.50?
Whatever the reasons for the $485 in bad
checks which have had to be covered this
year, we, along with Mr, Harkey and the Exe-
cutive Committee, remind each student that
every bad check that is written in Lexington
further endangers the check cashing privi
leves of the entire student body. The purpose
of the Cold Check Committee is not to rescue
students from their own financial mishaps so
much as it is to insure the merchants of Lex
ington that the checks a student writes are
payable to the bearer on demand immedi
not one week later.
The committee can perform this function

ately

only if the students exercise their powers of
mathematics and judgment. If they choose to
do so (as the 49 students in the past ten week

the EC
changing that committee's name to the mor:

have done}, then should considet

(Editor's Note: “1 on 1” begins this week as a forum for the expression of
diverse opinion on issues which The Ring-tum Phi considers to be of interest
to the University. In the left hand column below appears the “pro” view-
point opposite the “con” opinion on the right. We invite your interest and
participation in order that “1 on 1° may be an effective forum for the ex-
pression of varied viewpoints within the University.)

BY HAP STEIN

Phe question of relevance is fac-
ing almost every facet of society to-
day. The universities and their in-
stitutions are no exception,

The questioning of relevancy has
even reached the most time-honored
institution here at Washington and
Lee: the Honor System. The ques-
tions being raised are sincere, well-
intentioned, and to the point. The
“Honor System Questionnaire”
which was circulated around school
several weeks ago brought out these
questions: What is the jurisdiction
of the honor system? Are the present
procedures viable? What penalty is
best fitted to the University
and to the accused? Is the existence
of the honor system at Washingion
and Lee necessary to the University?

The Honor System at Washington
and Lee University is based on one
principle: “A man shall conduct
himself as a gentleman.” This pre-
mise at first seems very ambiguous.
However, is not “honor” itself an
ambiguous word? Might not what
was considered dishonorable 100
years ago be thought of in different
terms today?

The Honor System takes this inio
accoum, by being “administered and
concerned solely with those offenses
which are considered as dishonor-
able by the siudent generation in-
volved.” Thus it can only be codified
to the extent that lying, cheating,
stealing are breaches of it. However,
these infringements are so opposed
to basic, moral ethics that under no
circumstances can they be condoned,
regardless of place or time.

For an Honor System to be rele
vant, “honor” must be a part of the
individual at all times. The Univer-
sity must do everything it can to en
courage this, and the Honor System
must apply at all times and places to
a student of Washingion and Lee

True, “honor” cannot be forced
on anyone, nor should it be achiev-
ed negatively, but since lying, steal
ing and cheating are so contrary to
basic moral ethics, the Universily
cannot overlook a dishonorable act
by any of its members, at any ime
or any geographical location while
the student is enrolled in Washing
ton and Lee.

The question of what the policy
should be in more detailed matters

such as homework, cold tests and
other matier involves the profes
sors’ right to set a policy. Since

homework and tests are considered
by many professors to be part of
the learning process, and the school
has given the instruction of that pro
cess to the professor, they obviously
shoul! have their own rules on tests
and homework. Any
these which involves
stealing or cheating is a dishonorable

BY DAVID OLSON

The Honor System should be
changed. There is a good possibility
that in fact the Honor System has al-
ready changed. The Honor System
exists through the jurisdiction of the
students and therefore the students
call the shots as to what is dishonor-
able of what is honorable. There-
fore, the prevelant attitudes of the
students will dictate the de facto
guidelines of the Honor System, not
what is set out in the handbook.
This is a hard thing to recognize,
for anyone.

I think that everyone feels tha!
the idea of honor is a good thing.
However, does the idea of honor
necessarily dictate a certain set of
rules and regulations that are sac-
rosanct over any other set of rules
or over no rules? It is my belief that
the Honor System does need to be
changed. It has to be changed be-
cause it is, by its very nature, as set
up now, an inhibitive factor in the
learning process.

As the Honor System now stands
honor may be upheld but is learning
aided by the Honor System? In
many ways I think not. For instance,
if a student has a paper to do, by the
set of rules now enforced he cannot
talk with anyone about the paper
because he may inadverntently learn
something about the subject of his
paper which he otherwise would not
have known and if he put that in his
paper the student to whom he talked
is duty bound to turn him in on an
honor violation. Is that a violation
of the idea of honor? Is that student
dishonorable and should he be “ask-
ed to leave"? One of the primary
reasons for the university is the fact
that it provides an open forum for a
dialectical learning process, It seems
that the Honor system stands in the
way of this ideal and because of this
the Honor System should be chang-
ed.

lt goes without saying that if the
Honor System is changed every at-
tention should be given to the fact
that the Honor System should in-

Achievements

ONE-THIRD OF YEAR

Much Left To Be Done;
Initiated Plans Ferment

BY MONTY COTTIER

The following is an outline of the
Executive Committee’s accomplish-
ments during the last three months,
and a review of those accomplish-
ments,

September 26

Fancy Dress’s Cancellation is an-

nounced.

Establishment of an Open Forum is

made.

Passage of a resolution establishing
a University-City Relations Com-
mittee.

October 5

The Student Bar Association fund
request is sent to the Finance
Committee.

The name of the Cold Check Com-
mittee is changed to the Student
Financial Relations Committee.

October 12

The Legal Aid and Research Com-
mittee of the Law School will do
research on the legality of the city
tags for out-of-state students.

Membership on the Honor System
Subcommittee is determined.

The Conference Fund Committee is
an appeal board for the Student
Finance Committee.

The faculty’s independent exam en-
velope is approved.

October 19

All independent exams are “hot” un-
til the end of the exam period.

A statement of policy limiting the
use of the Cockpit and placing its
use under the control of the Uni-
versity Center-Assimilation Com-
mittee is made.

The Honor System Study is initiated.

October 26

A $40 allocation is made for the
printing of a Student Government
newsletter.

Nov. 16

The Curriculum Committee is di-
rected to study the feasibility of a
course review.

Applications are sought for the stu-
dent position on the Committee
on Courses and Degrees.

Nov. 30

The possibility of a
Council is advanced.
The above constitutes a brief,

thumbnail sketch of what the Execu-

tive Committee of the student body
has accomplished during the firs!
third of its nine-month life this year.

Many of the actions (such as the
report given before the EC that
Fancy Dress had been cancelled, the
delegation of the Legal Aid and Re-
search Committee of the Law School
to study the city’s new license plates,
and so on) have been greeted with
hoots and shouts and controversy
throughout the campus. Others, such
as the projected course review and
the establishment of a “court of last
resort” for students wishing to chal
lenge the ruling of the newly-renam-
ed Student Financial Relations Com
mittee, were scarcely the cause of
school-stopping demonstrations or
mournful tollings from Washington
Hall. Most of them, in fact, like the
vast majority of the EC's weekly,
routine, “housekeeping” proposals
and appropriations, receive no atten-
tion at all,

Moments of drama and periods of
crisis have, it is true, been rare this
semester in the EC's work. Indeed,
one could say that the $40 alloca-
tion for the newsletter and the initia
tion of the Honor System study were
accomplished with almost identical
airs of businesslike efficiency, and
with a minimum of fanfare.

It is, perhaps, too early to ascer-
tain the impact of the proposed Uni

Envelopes Required By Friday

This year each W&L student will
determine the sequence of his final
exams by himself. Rules and regula-
tions for the examinations can be
found in the University catalogue.

The exam schedule for the Fall
term will be as follows: Dec. 12, 14,
15, and 16 from 9:00 a.m. to noon
and from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. and
from 9:00 asm. to noon on Dec. 17.

A student will schedule his exami-
nations according to the following
procedure: this week he will obtain
from the registrar’s office a special
examination envelope for each of
his classes and a schedule form, He
will prepare a schedule of this exam-
inations (on the form provided),
supply the information requested at
the top of each envelope and give
the examination envelope to the ap
propriate instructor at the first class
meeting of the last week of sched-
uled classes.

Failure to register prior to the ex-
amination period jprevents a student
from taking an examination.

The student may change his sche-
dule only through petition to the
Executive Committee of the faculty.
Any student late for an examination
will not receive time beyond the an-

Sea & The East Utopian Mission
Will Rock The Lyric, Lexington

BY TOM MAYS

The room is small, with log walls
and exposed beams, all of it filled,
jammed with musical equipment.

Amplifiers, microphones, an elec-
tric organ, guitars and drums—a
single lamp with a bare bulb.

Sea steps up to the microphone in
the center of the room, mumbles
something about “Majesty,” gives a
cue and the music begins.

Incredibly loud at close range,
the music swirls, vibrates the floor-
boards, crashes about the room, en-
guifs everything with sound,

The drums throb. Hair streaming
Sea reaches for a note, his voice
slightly raspy, his face intense.

The mood...
Majesty
I can see...
You're much too free...

I must find a way to reach you
But we're two worlds apart...

Sea—that’s his full name—is 19.
In addition to being the lead singer,
he is also the composer and the lyri-
cist for the group, Sea and the East
Utopian Mission, which rents a rus-
tic farm near Fredericksburg, Va.

The group has been together for
about two years. Last year they
toured Florida where they appeared
at the Miami Pop Festival. Across
the country, they played in concert
with such well-known groups as Big
Brother and the Holding Co., Pogo
and the Guess Who.

This past fall the band played the
college circuit in Virginia, Washing-
ton and Maryland. They are current-
ly putting in five, six and seven hours
a day practicing, writing, and re-
writing the songs they will do as
they cross the country to California.

The Ring-tum Phi Rivals

Penelope Ashe Style

To the Editors of The Ring-tum Phi:

The tenth
year’s Ring-tum Phi now lies in
front of me, reread twice.

The only thing notable about the
issue seems to be the fact that it is
a carbon copy of ithe nine issues pre-
ceding it, a feat of journalistic skill
which rivals the collective Penelope
Ashe in creative ability.

My comments are not to be con-
strued as simply non-constructive
criticism, but, rather, they should be
viewed as one reader’s effort to
show to those concerned that which
does not appeal to him:

1). You seem to make a pointed
effort to perpetuate the never-end-
ing and childish feud ‘between Alan

lof 2 Earphones
Are Returned

BY GARY POLIAKOFF

One of the two sets of Koss stereo
earphones taken from the Anderson
Music Room in McCormick Library
has been returned. The other is still
as yet unretrieved.

Professor Robert Stewart offered
a reward in the last issue of the
Ring-tum Phi for information con-
cerning the earphones. A few days
ago two students found one of the
sets and returned it to the Music
Room. The earphones are valued 1
$29 a pair.

Professor Stewart said, “We oper-
ate the Music Room in an informal
way. I was a little surprised when
two of the earphones disappeared. I
am thankful that we were able to
retrieve one pair.”

Prater, Craig Jones, and J. D. Bry-
messer over the now-distant fresh-
men elections. While this bickering
obviously pleases the three men
mentioned, (no doubt they like the
idea of having their names in print
each issue), I can't see where it
would interest any body else.

2). You do an admirable job in
reporting the events and formal hap-
penings around campus, but, remem-
ber, Washington and Lee is not some
‘huge auditorium in which these
events take place at an impersonal
distance. The Ring-tum Phi is over-
looking its greatest possible source
of news—the students themselves—
human beings with feelings, ideas,
dislikes, preferences. A little more
personal reporting might brighten
up your dull collage of news trivia.

Enough said. Perhaps your other
readers would like to comment.

A Brand X Article
By A Brand X Writer

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:
Bob LaRue’s Brand X article was
one of the worst collections of bull
I have ever read. It consists of
cheap, bush, unfounded, demeaning
charges against a group of profes-
sional athletes who for the most
have made substantial, positive con-
tributions to their teams’ perform-
ances. Aside from the content, the
article is technically lousy: at least
six names are misspelled. If this
team ever needs a brand x sports-
writer to cover it, LaRue’s the one.

versity Council mentioned elsewhere
in this week’s The Ring-tum Phi.
However, it is not too early to at-
tempt a categorization of the 1970-
71 Executive Committee as one for
whom the business of examination,
revision, and change holds no hid-
den terrors, but also one for whom
that business is not the occasion for
bullhorns, bands, or fireworks.

Should all of the alterations in
the mental and physical environment
known as Washington and Lee
which the EC has contemplated or
is now contemplating come to pass,
it is, almost certainly, a foregone
conclusion that life on the W&L
campus will be a different proposi-
tion than it has been in the past. It is
not the purpose of this examination
to consider the relative good or evil
in such a change, but rather to ob-
serve the skill and efficiency, or lack
of them, with which the change is
being effected.

Some changes have been made al-
ready. Many others, it is safe to as-
sume, remain to be made. Many of
the minor tasks confronting the EC
now are simply finishing touches on
major changes of a semester, a year,
or two years ago. One by one, two
by two, and in great, thundering
hordes the old concepts of in loco
parentis, student dependency, and,
occasionally, student apathy are be-
ing brought before the systematic
scrutiny of the Executive Committee
and are subjected to a gradual war
of attrition.

Ruggers Field
Twelfth Place

In Tournament

Playing in the Washington Invi-
tational Sevens Tournament _ this
weekend, the Washington and Lee
Rugby team made its best showing
of the season. In a field of forty-
five teams from the U.S. and Can-
ada, W&L drew Louisville Univer-
sity as its first opponent. In a game
that cannot be rated as a contest, the
team swept into the division quar-
ter-finals to meei the Richmond A
Rugby Club. Scores by Chris Mur-
ray and Charlie Brown with extra
points by Fred Fletcher enabled
W&L to walk away from their op-
ponent by a score of 15-6.

Having worked their way to the
semi-finals, the Generals were paired
against the Ottawa Rugby Club, Na-
tional Canadian Champions.

Playing on the Lincoln Memoria!
Mall, in the shadow of the Washing-
ton Monument, the ruggers fell 23-0
in a contest that was a classic in
frustration. Completely outclassed,
the Generals never said die Ottawa
went on to the finals only to lose to
Georgetown University 10-3.

and this week clearly indicates it. The Rams
dumped the Forty-Niners, the Jets blasted

some guy previously unknown took on the in-

sticking his foot out to halt an apparent
touchdown run. After it was all over, no less
than five teammates said that they had plann-
ed to do the same thing, and the coach was
noted for saying that he taught his players
to think clean and play dirty. I'd hate to think

W&L Dunks Randolph-M

BY PALMER TRICE

Last night, for the first time since
the 1961-62 season, the Washington
and Lee Generals grabbed a basket-
ball victory over the Randolph-Ma-
con Yellow Jackets, 53-46. The sea-
son’s opener did much to show that
the Generals are not coming, they
are here. Before what sounded like
15,000 screaming fans, both teams
opened slowly. After about four min-
utes, the score was but 3-1. One had
memories of such inspiring games
as the North Carolina State-Duke
game of several years ago. Heavily
favored Duke ended up losing 12-10.

Both teams, which were getting
but one shot at the basket, began to
hit. Led by Paul McClure’s 9 points.
the Generals led at the half, 24-18.
Coach Canfield’s Corns employed
several defenses, one of them being
a very tight man for man.

The second half found both teams
more effective on offense. W&L
mair.tained its lead, Offensively, they
were led by Captain Mike Daniel,
who ended the game with 16 points
and 13 rebounds. Broken-nosed
Ellie Gutshall sparked the Generals
1-3-1 zone. His traps rattled the
Yellow Jackets, who shot a mere
27% from the floor.

Randolph-Macon was led by sen-

Grapplers Pin Guilford College

Bard Wrisley, a 177 pounder who
was eight pounds overweight 12
hours before the match, sweated
down to become the hero of W&L’s
season opener with Guilford Col-
lege. With the wrestlers down 14-12
in a see-saw battle through 167,
Wrisley drew first points as he gain-
ed a takedown in the opening period.
This was nullified, however, by his
opponents’ reversal and the period
ended tied.

The dramatic point ocourred with
15 seconds left in the second period
when Wrisley caught his man off-
balance and pinned him to put W&L
ahead 17-14.

Captain Dee Copenhaver follow-
ed with a victory in a tight battle
that saw him come from behind in
the second period and ride his Guil-

ford man out for a 5-0 win. This
salted the match away, but the final
insult was added when heavyweight
Jim Hooker strolled to the mat, took
down his opponent and pinned him
in the first minute of the contest.

In the lower weights Pat Buford
got the seasons first points as he
drew with his 118 pound opponent.
Buford’s match was notable for his
remarkable comeback in the third
period after being behind 5-1. At
126 pounds Bruce Hyatt fell 6-0 in
a tough contest that was marked by
Hyatt’s inability to escape from his
Opponent.

The highlight of the lower weights,
however, was provided by Craig
Hankins, a fine 134 pounder, who
took his Opponent down and pinned

him with a bridging cradle after one

===

minute and 17 seconds. Bill West
received a forfeit at 142 and at 150
pounds Bill Melton ran into some
stiff competition from a fine Guil-
ford opponent. Melton fell victim
12-2 as did Jim Steiff at 158 pounds
by a margin of 13-3 and Jack Ross
at 167 8-1.

The Generals travel to Dickinson,
a Pennsylvania wrestling stronghold,
on Saturday and host the Blue De-
vils of Duke here Tuesday at 7:30
p.m.

According to the coaches, if the
team can improve at the middle
weights and continue to win at the
upper weights, the prospects for a
highly successful season looks excel-
lent. Even at this point the team has
equalled last year’s win record.

 

Jimmy Hooker puts the final touch on his Guilford foe for a quick five points finalizing the score at 25-14,

ior Dale Kurowsky’s 11 points, The
Yellow Jackets could not come up
with the big play. They could find
no one to take control, and beat the
General's defense. Although Coa-h
Webb’s roundballers outscored the
home team from the floor, they con-
verted only 12 of 25 free throw at-
tempts.

Due to last minute attempts by
the Yellow Jackets to get the ball,
the Blue and White took 37 gift
shots, and made 21 of them, many
in the final seconds. The Generals
shot about 33% from the field.
Neither team looked extremely
strong. Coach Canfield, while pleas-
ed with the win, admitted that his
boys “looked ragged.” He said that
the team showed poise. Their dedi-
cation to the game showed on the
court.

Look for some changes in offense,
with more movement on the court.
The shooting as a whole should, and
will improve. Mindful that “we
could have broken the game open
from the foul line,” the free throw
percentage should rise. The polish
of a winning team should come with
time.

Thursday, the Generals play

score, 85-75, was due mostly to ex-
cellent teamwork. The J.V. B-ballers
looked as if they had played together
for several seasons. Matt Montgo-
mery led the scoring with 21 points.
Others in double figures were Geoff
Nolan, Jerry Porath, Craig Smith,
and Phifer Helms. The Generals
consistently broke the Yellow Jacket

Sea used to call his music, “acid
blues,” but he dropped that descrip-
tive title as the group’s repertoire has
expanded.

They now play hard rock, blues,
and country and western in a unique
combination of different styles.

This Saturday night the band will
appear at the Lyric Cinema at 11:00
p.m. On Sunday the group will play
in concert at 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m.
in the afternoon. See the Lyric

Mahaffey’s career totals are 127
catches for 1,449 yards and eight
touchdowns, a new school record by
a big margin.

Carter, who already holds the all-
time record for number of punts (he
punted the ball 90 times in nine
games in 1968), easily set a new
national career record in the same
category. In his three years, Carter
punted the ball 222 times for 7,716
yards. The old record was a mere
197 punts for 7,148 yards set by
Kevin McClelland of Arkansas State
in 1966-68.

the Executive Committee Room of
the Student Center. Members of the
University community are cordially
invited to view the seven contempor-
ary paintings, which will be in Lex-
ington until January.

Norman Annis’ “Dead Crow” a
charcoal work, contrasts the two en-
tities of beauty and death. Annis is
an American artist currently teach-
ing at Gettysburg College.

Marcelo Bonevardi, a native Ar-
gentine now living in New York
City, combines a sense of mysticism
with the mixed media of painting,
architecture, and sculpture in his
“Moon Guardian.”

Harvey Breverman, who teach2s
at the State University of New Yort:
at Buffalo, is the creator of “Figure
with Tallis.” an intaglio print. Bre-
verman employs a high degree of
technical knowledge with a keea
sense of craftsmanship in placing a
human image halfway between real-
ity and dream.

Eduardo Mac Entyre, another Ar-
gentine, employs contrasting shapes
and colors to manifest a form of op
art in “Pintura Generativa Transpar-
ancias.”

Lowell Nesbitt, born in Baltimore,
bu tcurrently a New York resident,
uses his work, “IBM 1418” to an-
swer the question “What is real-
ity?” His is a wholly modern ende»-
vor in pencil and etching, attempting
to place detail at an absolute mini-
mum,

Gabor Peterdi, a native of Hun-
gary now teaching at Yale, is the
engraver of “Winter,” which al-
tempts to deal with both landscape
and the image of man.

Rogelio Polesello’s “Variation N>
8” is an avant-garde effort, formu-
lated in part by spray-on paint and
stencils.

on these feelings.

I believe these things can happen.
And if any one thing confirms my
belief, it is the work which has tak-
en place during the past two months
between the Faculty Executive Com-
mittee and the Student Executive

and variance of opinion, but there
was also honesty and frankness, fe-

1 On 1: The Honor System

Olson

(Continued from Page 2)

clude an amending clause so that
the Honor System can be changed
when social conditions call for it.
The Honor System committee
should make every effort to make
the Honor System fit current stu-
dent attitudes about honor. It
strikes me as disastorous that in its
recent poll the Honor System study
committee did not include a section
about the idea of honor. The pol!
dealt with particulars, not attitudes
and I don’t think that they got a
good idea of the current feelings
about honor. They go some indica-
tion of the current feelings about the
Honor System but not about honor.

It is apparent that a concept like
honor is something that will change
with different social and political
conditions. I think that this genera-
tion of students has a different con-
cept of what honor is (and should be)
from the previous one, Therefore,
since the Honor System seems to
exist for the students it should ut
least try to parallel the feelings of
the students. It is inevitable that our
concept of honor be different from
our father’s because we have grown
up in an entirely different world.
Some will say that honor is static
and therefore should not be changed.
I don’t think that, particularly at this
time in history, anyone can say that
anything is static because everything
is changing.

The Honor System is a difficult
thing to change. I am not even sure
how it should be changed but we
are at least looking at it which is
necessary. We have got to see if we
can make the Honor System coin-
cide with a contemporary concept
of honor. We must also make the
Honor System something that is
helpful to the learning process, and
not an unwieldy giant.

outside pressure as possible. A clos-
ed trial provides those conditions.

When a student has ‘been convicted
of an honor violation, there is no
doubt that he must be (punished.
This punishment must be in such a
form as to best help the accused and
the university, Although our experi-
ence with our present jail system
tells us that severe punishment is
seldom profitable for the convicted
or society as a whole, the University
has no room for lying, cheating or
stealing.

When a person has been asked to
withdraw, the University does itself
no harm by withholding the exact
nature of the withdrawal. Washing-
ton and Lee must, however, be fair
to other universities, and a statement
to the effect that the student con-
ducted himself in a manner unbe-
coming a W&L student would be
fairest to another university and the
convicted student,

Hence, two conclusions can be
drawn. First, honor is definitely
needed in our age of polarization,
rapid change and revolution. Second,
although dishonorable acts can

never be changed, the answers sur-

rounding the makeup of the Honor
System are not all black and white.
Change can be helpful, but only
when it helps to promote “honor.”

On Independent Exams

BY STAMAN OGILVIE

Assuming you have given a dated
exam envelope to each of your pro-
fessors, (If not, (1) lay down this
paper, (2) call your profs, (3) beg
clemency) you have two duties for
the next eight days. First, appear at
the appointed times to demonstrate
your competence in your curricula,
and secondly, curb your tongue,

The administrative foundation up-
on which this independent system is
‘based requires that each exam be
taken at the pre-arranged time. You
may not receive your exam at any
other time than the period for which
you registered. Have an accurate re-
cord of what exam is to be taken
when and present yourself at the
prescribed time and place.

The philosophical foundation of
this exam arrangement demands that
the contents of each exam be yours
to ruminate, enjoy, curse, but not
discuss. Disclosure of particulars or
any reference to makeup or degree
of difficulty of any exam jeopardizes
the legitimacy of test scores. Dis
cussion of any aspect of previously
taken exams with anyone except
your professor until after noon, De-
cember 17 must be dealt with as a
breach of the Honor System.

Independent exams have been a
long time coming. Students have
sought for years, relief from the con-
straints of arbitrarily assigned test
schedules. For two years self-sched-
uled exams have been pursued thro-
ugh legislative channels at W&L.

The faculty, in January 1969, re-
jected a student-initiated indepen-
dent exam proposal (after its recom-
mendation by the Student Body Exe-
cutive Committee and the Faculty
Committee on Council and Degree).
Their complaints: (1) with the then
current ten day exam period most
people already had reasonable sched-
ules; (2) the difficulty of admini-
stering an independent schedule out-
weighed its benefits in flexibility; (3)
the arrangement could unnecessarily
burden the Honor System. Discus-
sion ended, subject closed.

Until, God bless them, the new
curriculum and the calendar ren
dered the neatly arranged ten day
set-up too long and any shortene*
offspring too complicated.

So with the new academic dawn
came a free-scheduling exam week.
Skeptics decry the flexibility of an
independence to take four or five
exams in five test days. But, brothers
and seven sisters, the alternative
plans allowed the possibility of three
exams in one day. With this enlight-
ened perspective, oh, careworn and
study4aden, rejoice in your freedom
but in your rejoicing accept the new
duties and shut the hell up.

Faculty Approves University
Council and Honors Program

A “University Council” with 13
student members and 17 from the
faculty and administration was ap-
proved Monday by the faculty.

The Council will serve as an ad-
visory agency offering recommenda-
tions and suggestions regarding re-
ports prepared for submission to
general faculty meetings by other
official committees.

In addition, it is designed to serve
“as a forwm for the exchange of
ideas on critical issues pending be-
fore the community.”

The faculty, in its regular Decum-
ber meeting, also delegated to the
newly created University Council
authority in non-academic, non-cur-
ricular student affairs. The new

council will exercise the faculty's re-
sponsibility for student and frater-
nity conduct, dormitory rules and
regulations and will aid both in plan-
ning freshman orientation and in ad-
ministering the faculty advisor sys-
tem.

Each standing faculty committee
will pass its reports through the new
council before sending them to the
faculty itself. Thowgh the Counc:'
will have no power to amend or veto
other committee proposals and reg-
ulations, it will be expected to com-
ment on them.

The Council will also serve to in-
itiate proposals to the faculty, ad-
ministration and student body as
well.

EC Studies
Selection of
New Council

There was certainly no Christmas
rush on business in Monday's Exe-
cutive Committee meeting. Only two
major topics were discussed — the
University Council and the “drug
problem” at Washington and Lee.

President Fran Lawrence announc-
ed that the University Council pro-
posal had passed a faculty vote by a
5 to | margin. The announcement
produced a brief flurry of excite-
ment; as one EC member put it: “All
right! The school is ours!” The pro
gram is scheduled for implementa-
tion in early February. A motion to
refer election procedure details to

the Constitutional Subcommitice
passed unanimously, Glenn Azuma
promised a report at the second
January meeting

A committee of Jim Slay, Rich

Murray, Bob Johnson, and President
Lawrence was appointed to stud:

pose in mind to offer suggestions to

Designed jointly by committees
of the faculty and the student gov-

permit student participation in po!-
icy-making decisions at the Univer-
sity, according to Dr. William J.
Watt, associate dean of the College
and chairman of the faculty's exe-
cutive committee, which presented
the proposal at Monday's meeting.

The student members of the
Council will have full voting privi-
leges and will be treated exactly as
the faculty and administration mem-
bers of the council, under the fac-
ulty resohution creating it.

Students have previously been
given voting representation on other

Newscaster Roger Mudd deliver-
ed the address at the annual Omic-
ron Delta Kappa Assembly in which
12 student leaders were tapped as
new members,

Mudd told the audience that tele-
vision, especially in its news cover-
age, has not lived up to its early
promise.

As a visual medium, he said, TV
has fallen into the easy trap of em-
phasizing happenings rather than
the reasons behind them, action rath-
er than ideas, “emotions rather than
intellect.”

“Inquiry and explanation are es:
sential” in a complete presentation
of the news, Mudd declared, but
television too frequently ignores
them. Because news shows last just
30 minutes, there is no time for ex-
planations, and in their place “face
and violence” become all-important.

Omicron Delta Kappa national
honorary leadership fraternity was
founded at W&L 56 years ago and
Rupert N. Latture, special advisor
to President Huntley, was an honor-
ed guest at the ceremony.

Mudd, a W&L alumnus, was al-
most an hour late arriving because
his scheduled flight from Washing-
ton was cancelled at the last min-
ute. Huntley, a classmate of Mudd’s
at the university—entertained the
audience of some 700 students, fac-
ulty, and other guests with an ad-
libbed “program” of anecdotes and
stories.

Named to the national honorary
fraternity for leadership — were
three third-year students in the
School of Law, six undergraduaie
seniors and three juniors.

The law students named to mem-
‘bership are:

Robin P. Hartmann of Arlington.
He is editor-in-chief of the univer-
sity’s Law Review, president of the
Student Bar Association and an argu-
ing member of the university's moot

of sloppy dress prevalent on any cow college campus in the
United States.

One case in point should serve to show why the above
quotation should be deleted from the Handbook.

The basketball game with Randolph-Macon a week ago
Tuesday might as well have been played at College College in
Collegetown, Anywhere, U.S.A. There were the Randolph-
Macon students—small in number—looking like they came
from Randolph-Macon. There were the Washington and Lee
students—overwhelming in number—yet looking like they
came over from Buena Vista to “catch ‘at bawl game.” The
Randolph-Macon students might well have been doubtful as
to where they were—if “W&L” didn’t stand out in blue on
white on the Washington and Lee uniforms.

The tradition of conventional dress was not an intrinsic
value that the students prized above their gentlemanly con-
duct, self respect, and pride. It was, however, a reflection of
those values, a reflection which was an indication that they
cared enough about themselves and their school to dress con-
ventionally. Perhaps they still hold to these values which make
Washington and Lee's community unique among the myriad
of computerized diploma mills in the country, But what other
school would buy that argument? The alumni of 10 years and
back must wonder what has happened to one of the well-
known reputations of their alma mater. And juniors and sen-
iors in high school certainly must be somewhat less impressed
with the outward manifestations of what is claimed in the
University’s introductory literature. The point is this: “times”
may have changed, but since when has the concept of one’s
own personal pride altered?

Perhaps we have not been “with it.” Perhaps the appear-
ance fits the reality and we are indeed in the “Age of Aquar-
ium.” If so, then perhaps students should be required to wear
jeans (with at least one rip in the knee), no socks (except in
designated winter months), no tie, and a shirt (perfectly
wrinkled),

The death of intellectual curiosity and the beginning of
narrow gnosticism is to some extent reflected in the pathetic
fallacy that clothing styles should reflect a style of thought.

A Thought,

While we're on the subject of ideals and realities, we can’t
help thinking that the institution of the new independent ex-
amination schedule is not going to please everyone the first
time around. In fact, if we are any judges of human nature
whatsoever, the first to be against continuation of the inde-
pendent exams will be those who are confused.

In order to ward off any confusion surrounding the inde-
pendent examinations for this term, we have printed on this
page a description of the procedure which is to be followed by
each student during the next week. We find the procedure to be
quite simple and convenient—provided that all students are
aware of the requirements involved.

We imagine there will be more than a handful of miffed
faculty members and students at noon on December 17, but
we hope their cause for disgruntlement will either be the pro-
spect of having to grade 100 or so tests, or the retrospect of
four or five exams that were more difficult than they should
have been,

And A Thoughtful Wish

We aren't able to imagine it, but we are told that there was
a time when W&L students did not receive any vacation holi-
day over Christmas, But we're glad not only for our own
breather from the weekly task of putting the six pages of this
glorious rag together, but for the needed rest this vacation al-
fords several people in the Print Shop who are the real men
behind this newspaper: Messrs, Larry Mason, Hunter MeCoy,
Ed Walker and Wayne Conner.

On behalf of them and ourselves, we wish you the mer-
riest Christmas any W&L students could ever hope to have: a

worry-free and a study-free vacation.

 

A Pictorial Editorial

How many times in one’s life can man realize the true worth of his
place in a larger group? How often is one able to recollect the moments
when he and his fellow men were truly happy with the simple fact of
living together? President Robert E. R. “Rube” Huntley and Mr, Roger
“Boomer” Mudd brought one of these moments to the ODK assembly
Monday. And for about one hour, the essence of Washington and Lee
was in their words and in the laughter of those about them.

Registrants wishing to drop defer-
ments and be reclassified into Class
I-A status to take advantage of a
year-end policy announced last
month by the Selective Service Sys-
tem, have been given until midnighi,
December 31, 1970, to file for the
reclassification. Such requests must
be received by local ‘boards by that
date or carry a postmark dated De-
cember 31, 1970 or earlier.

The announcement is contained in
instructions issued to local board
personnel by Dr. Curtis W. Tarr,
National Director of Selective Serv-
ice. These instructions alter previous
policy which stated that the applica-
tion had to be in the hands of local
board personnel prior to a Decem-
ber meeting of the local board.

In particular, the instruction to
local boards will be of interest lo
men who hold high numbers in the
1970 draft lottery. Should a young
man hold a number higher than that
reached by his local board—and No.
195 has been set as the highest num-
ber which any local board can reach
—-it is to his advantage to voluntar-
ily give up hi sdeferment for a I-A
classification. In these cases, he will
move to a lower draft priority group
on January 1, 1971 with other mem-
bers of the 1970 first priority group
with unreached numbers.

While recognizing that young
men holding lottery numbers over
their local board “high” could ef-
fectively limit their vulnerability to
the draft by being classified into I-A
by the year’s end, Dr. Tarr stated
that “the law allows young men fo
elect whether they will apply for a
deferment and those young men
granted deferments should be able
to drop them if they desire.”

Dr. Tarr said the new policy was
issued because various boards thro-
ughout the country were scheduling
their last meetings of the year at

In reference to an overwhelming

In response to several kind ques-

known that we had a very nice
Thanksgiving, thank you, and that
the head cold which had been pla-
guing us for these past weeks is just
about abated.

We will be going home this next
Thursday, and are looking forward
to a very pleasant Christmas with
our families. Readers of The Ring-
tum Phi who enjoy personal report-
ing will, we are sure, be looking
forward to a complete recounting of
our Yuletide adventures with an
eagerness that borders on the rabid.

 

Take The Time

BY ROBERT BAROODY

Friday night, the 4th of Decem-
ber. A night on the edge of cold:
just enough to cause people to hud
die together, 7:30 p.m. in Lexing-
ton, Virginia, where children stoud
five deep on Main Street; it was time
for the annual Christmas Parade.

fFor those who missed the par-
ade, I feel pity. These flesting
glimpses of our childhood are ex-
ceedingly rare. The entire first half
of our lives seems to have been ob-
literated by the analytic mind of the
second half, So must we savour the
moment's joy.)

it was all there. Look, Debbie
and Sandy, local damsels spirited
past in Ford Galaxies. Look, the
endiess sputter of good and not-so-
good floats. Look, bands, elfin me
joreties, and clowns demanding, : 2
imploring, “Laugh!” And if you
would forget that Santa Claus was a
littie out of it; if you could forget
that many marchers drift away al
the ghetto’s fringe; if you threw
down the weight of cynicism forever
cultivated by Esquire and The Wash
ingion Post. . . then you laughed.

Unfortunately. we remember that
we are collegians. A parade is all of
America’s fantasies and realities on
display. Small boys with rifles

The point of this sentiment is to

ed if not practical hope existed.
When did the man-child turn pessi-

tained by nihilism? Who or what

different times. By defining a specific
cutoff date, the new policy allows all
registrants an equal amount of time
to take advantage of the reclassifica-
tion offer.

Previous to changing this policy
on dropping of deferments, regist-
rants holding deferments were gen-
erally unable to relinquish volun-
tarily them as long as they continued
to meet the criteria for deferment,
except at the end of the defermen:
period when they could cancel them
simply by not submitting the neces-
sary documents for an extension.

Dr. Tarr pointed out that all de-
ferments are issued for limited per-
iods of time, generally for one year,
and that it is the responsibility of
the registrant to submit documenta-
tion for an extension of his defer-
ment. In the absence of documenta-
tion, the new Local Board Memur-
andum instructs local boards to re-
classify promptly registrants into 1-
A. This means that registrants wish-
ing to continue their deferments
should submit the supporting docu-
mentation to their local boards.

Student Center
Survey Reveals
Expansion Need

This past week, the W&L student
body was once again assailed with a
barrage of questionnaires. Hidden
in the paper drifts were occasional
sheets which inquired of their read
ers opinions on subjects such as
their interest in combo parties, film
festivals, bridge tournaments, and
any number of other possible activi-
ties.

Put out by the members of the
University Center-Orientation Com-
mittee, the survey attempted to
gauge student enthusiasm for the
suggestions put forward by the com-
mittee by having participants check
either “Like,” “Dislike,” or “Indif-
ferent” beside the various sugges-
tions.

Approximately 600 of the ques-
tionnaires were filled out during the
course of last Wednesday's classes, a
number which the members of the
committee felt to be large enough to
provide a reasonable barometer of
student sentiment.

From the responses obtained,
members of the University Center-
Orientation Committee feel that
there is a good deal of support for
the University Center's branching
out into other entertainment areas.

Particularly popular were idess
such as the film festival, in which
flicks by the same artist, or with
similar themes, or just of high ap-
peal, will be offered to the student
body: theme parties to take the place
of the standard combo-mixer affair;
expanded versions of “Sem Night;”
an dother activities about which the
committee had either heard interes’
expressed, either from outside or
within the committee.

It is likely that work on imple-
menting these new ideas will begin
soon after the beginning of the win
ter term, in order to give them a fair
trial and judge their popularity with
some degree of experience backing
up the decision.

The very newness of the Univer-
sity Center as a school facility has
meant that new directions of utiliza-
tion have had to be mapped, The di-
rection taken by the University Cen-
ter-Orientation Commitice seems to
be one of seeking to broaden the
uses and benefits to be derived from
the structure,

Ohio State takes on Stanford and
Heisman winner Jim Plunkett in

Rex Kern, the running of John

OSU defense will make the differ-

Meanwhile, the eyes of Texas and
most of the nation will be turned to
Dallas, where the number 1 Horns
host Notre Dame in the Cotto
Classic. This one should really be a
good game. Texas’ offense, com-
prised of the run, was nothing short
of awesome in the Big Shootout II

against the ground game. But the
Irish will ‘be in a vengeful mood,

Horns but my money’s on Notre

And just 250 miles south of Dal-

Generals Control Lynchburg, 73-71

BY PALMER TRICE

“It's a win,” commented round-
ball coach Verne Canfield, after his
Generals slid ‘by the Lynchburg Hor-
nets. The game should have been
closer than the 73-71 score indicates,
but the Generals got off more shots
than the Hornets, both from the
field and from the line. In a post-
game interview, the W&L coach
said that he was disappointed in his
team’s performance. The 1-3-1 zone
half-court press that had worked so
well for the Generals in the first
half, producing five turnovers in a
row at one time, fell apart in the
second half. The Hornets got too
many inside shots, and too many of-
fensive rebounds. Coach Canfield
singled out 5’-11” guard Hatton
Smith for special praise. His four
long jumpers in the second half kept
the Generals in the lead. Mike Dan-
iel, as usual, led the squad, turning
another stellar job. John Glace
pumped in 18 points before he foul-
ed out late in the game.

Last Thursday, the Generals play-
ed their second game of the season,
at home, with the Bridgewater
Eagles. While winning 76-73, the
home team committed 20 turnovers.
John Glace tossed in 21 points, and
Mike Daniel, 18. Considering that it
was only the team’s second outing,
they did well. They shot a blistering
54% from the floor. Defensively,
Daniel and Co. showed 6 different
sets. Among these were the half-
court press, the match, a tight man

for man, and a sagging man for
man. The Generals showed that they
have a strong bench, receiving an
outstanding outing from Skip Licht-
fuss. In the Lynchburg game, W&L
didn’t move enough on defense, but
in this game, they stood around on
offense.

After the Bridgewater game,
Coach Canfield said that the team
lacked experience. This lack was to
prove fatal in the Old Dominion
contest. For the first half, “they
played our ball game.” After that,
the Old Dominion squad ran up
15 straight points, and the Gen-
erals lead no more. The final score
was 84-60, but the Old Dominion
coach Sonny Allen praised the W&L.
roundballers “for making us play
W&L’s game” in the first half. After
intermission, the Monarch’s patent-
ed fast break took control. The

Monarchs proved that they should
be the sixth ranked team in the
country. Pleased with the Blue’s per-
formance, Coach Canfield said that
his team gained a lot, playing an ex-
perienced team such as Old Domi-
nion on their home court.

In the future, look for more of
Hatton Smith. Perhaps he is the
hustle and the outside shooting that
the Generals have been lacking.
Against Hampden-Sydney on Thur .-
day, the Generals will need an out-
standing performance. The Tigers
beat those same Lynchburg Hornets
by a score of 111-95. Prior to their
game with W&L, Lynchburg had
been averaging over 90 points a
game.

Last night, the JayVees upset the
Baby Hornets, 85-79. This pushed
the Brigadeers’ record to 3-0. Last
week, they defeated the Bridgewater

Wrestlers Dumped By Dickinson, 31-11

BY DAVID TORRANCE

The Washington and Lee wrest-
ling team has already had two
matches, and from the looks of
those matches, the season looks pro-
mising for the grapplers. On Decem-
ber 1, the Generals beat Guilford
College by a score of 25 to 14. At
the 134 pound class, Craig Hankin
pinned his man, while Bill West won
by forfeit. At 118 pounds, Pat Bu-
ford tied, but Bart Wrisley pinned
his opponent at 177 pounds. The
only General to win by decision was
Dee Copenhaver, at 190. Jim Hook-
er, wrestling heavyweight, pinned
his adversary.

 

rrr

WELCOME!!

Unfortunately, the match with
Dickinson was not as successful for
the W&L team, which led by a
score of 31 to 11 on Saturday, De-
cember 5. W&L won only three of
the ten matches. Bruce Hyatt, in the
126 pound weight class, won by de-
cision, as did Dee Copenhaver,
wrestling at 190. The only General
to pin an opponent in this match
was Bard Wrisley, who was wrest-
ling heavyweight. Although Craig
Hankins lost, 2 to 0, he did a fine
job on Saturday.

From these two matches hopefully
the Generals have learned a lot.
They had a fine first match, and, in
their second, they learned what it is
like to face a strong team like Dick-
inson. This year, the lineup goes as
follows: Pat Buford at 118, Bruce
Hyatt at 126, Craig Hankins at 134,

Melton switching off at weights 150
to 158, Jack Ross at 167, Jay Ful-

cher or Bar Wrisley at 177, Dee
Copenhaver (the team captain) at
190, and at heavyweight—one of the
two 177 pounders (either Wrisley or
Fulcher). Six of these ten men are
wrestling this year for their first
time. The problem of inexperience
will be remedied as the season pro-
gresses. So far, though, this year’s
season looks much brighter than last
year’s when Washington and Lee
won only one of their nine matches.
On December 8, the Generals fice
a tough team from Duke. If the
grapplers win this, they will have ai-
a bettered their last year’s rec-
ord.

frosh, 87-74. In the Bridgewater con-
test, the Little Generals placed five
men in double figures—Frick and
Montgomery had 15, and Nolan,
Porath, and Smith had 14. The team
shot a tough 47%. In their third vic-
tory, Geoff Nolan led the scoring
with 25 points. Montgomery and
Porath both had 14. It looks like a
banner year for the J.V.s, as the
Lynchburg Freshman averaged 99
points a game in their last two out-
ings, until they met the powerful
Generals.

Faculty Approves Establishment
Of 30-Man University Council

including its executive commitice,
the two disciplinary committees, and
the University’s courses and degrees
committee.

The new council will have no jur-
isdiction over the Honor System.

Ex officio members of the new
council will be the president of the
student ‘body, the deans of the Col-
lege, the School of Commerce, Eco-
nomics and Politics and the School
of Law, the dean of students and the
president of the University.

Twelve faculty members and an
equal number of students will be
elected at large under procedures
which each group will propose at
January’s regular faculty meeting.

The faculty also approved a basic
re-design of the “honors” program
stressing intellectual creativity.

Under the new structure, students
will spend their last two years in
college, rather than simply their
senior year, undertaking honors
work. Included in each department's
honors program will be special inde-
pedent work in which students will
be required to produce a significant
thesis based on field or laboratory
work, a creative accomplishment in
the arts, or a comparable scholarly
undertaking demonstrating “more
than simply a mastery of the subject
matter,” according to the faculty
vote.

That independent work will carry
six to 12 hours’ credit toward grac-
uation — the equivalent of between
two and four normal courses.

The remainder of the honors cur-
riculum in each department will
cover regular course work, special
tutorial, directed reading projects,
seminars, and internships. Compre-
hensive examinations will also be
required.

Students will also be eligible to
undertake honors work in two or
three academic departments jointly.
or under an “independent” honors
major, with the approval of the
deans and faculty committees in-
volved.

The new honors program will go
into effect beginning next autumn.

On successful completion of the
program, a student will be graduated
“with honors”, and his achievement
will be noted on his diploma, in his
formal records and in special recog-
nition at commencement  cere-
monies.

In a third action, the facuity
cleared a program that will allow up
to three Washington and Lee stu-
dents to serve as special interns 9
members of Virginia’s General As-
sembly or legislative committees
during the winter academic term.

The internship program will be
non-partisan and will require the
presence of the three students thro-
ughout the session of the Assembly
which opens at the Capitol next
month,

After serving as research assis-
tants to delegates, state senators or
committees during the session —
which is expected to last six to eight
weeks—the students will spend the
remainder of the winter term oa
campus, completing individual pro-
jects related to their internships.

Participating students will receive
six credits in Politics 385 for the
special program.

While in Richmond, participating
students will live in private homes,
Those accommodations have been
arranged by Richmond civic and
service organizations. They will in-
volve no cost to the students.

To be eligible for designation as
an intern, a student must be at least
three credits or more ahead of his
“normal” schedule in his progress
toward accumulating graduation
credits. He must also have a 2.5
cumulative grade-point average or
higher.

BY MATT COLE
Chairman, Contact ’71

CONTACT ‘71 is coming next
week, The men speaking here have
been chosen not for their name nor
totally for their views. Rather they
have been chosen for their thoughts
and their ability to communicate
these ideas. They are men well read
and well learned in this year’s topic,
“The Crisis in Higher Education.”

They have had intimate contact
with universities and their problems.
Each will address himself to a separ-
ate crisis in education, from student
values to student unrest to black
education.

Two speakers should especially in-
terest the university community. Dr.
K. Ross Toole, author of “The Ty-
ranny of Spoiled Brats,” has been
voted the best professor for the past
seven years at the University of Mon-
tana. Although highly opposed to
student revolutionaries, he was
equally opposed to the interven-
tion in Cambodia. And during the
crisis at Montana last spring, he was
exempted by name from amy criii-
cism in a report issued by the stu-
dents—this in spite of his article at-
tacking student revolutionaries. H2
should be a tremendous speaker.

The other speaker is Dr. Arthur
G. Hensen, President of Georgia
Tech. He has some very dynami-
views on curriculum. He also has
some excellent ideas on ways stu-
dents can change the world. A young
president, he was elevated to the
position over three vice-presidents
at Georgia Tech and one from M.1.F.

This is not to say the other speak-
ers are not equally as good—they
are. Space permits discussion in this
column of only two.

“Contact” is more than speakers
this year. Its topic concerns the vital
existence of this university as well a;
others. Time is allowed for discus-
sion of the serious problems con-
fronting us.

The Committee has set aside three
“off” days during “Contact” in which
no speakers have been scheduled.
By leaving these three days open, the
Committee hopes that other student
groups and professors will take time
to analyze the issues presented dur-
ing “Contact” week. It is our hope
that these speakers will excite and
generate much thought and discus-
sion for weeks to come.

The men speaking here should e>-
cite such discussion, It is the hope
of the Committee that the university
community will mot let the discus-
sion die—citehr during CONTACT
‘71 or after its conchusion.

Contact Week

 

Toole and Hatfield Are
Symposium’s Speakers

Washington and Lee’s CONTACT
‘71 speaking symposium will begin
next Monday night with a presenta-
tion ‘by Dr. K. Ross Toole, promi:
nent professor at the University of
Montana.

Other highlights of the initial week
are a debate between Philip Abbot
Luce, chairman of the college divi-
sion, Young Americans for Freedom,
and Leonard Weinglass, a counsel
for the “Chicago Bight,” and a
speech by Sen. Mark Hatfield, Re-
publican Senator from the State of
Oregon.

CONTACT is an annual sym-
posium sponsored jointly by the In-
ter-Fraternity Council and the Stu-
dent Body. Each year its discussions
focus on a particular theme.

In the past, themes have been
“The City,” “The Crumbling Estab-
lishment,” and “Power.” Prominent
speakers who have come to Wash-
ington and Lee under the program's
auspices include Tom Wicker, Sena-
tor George McGovern, Former At-
torney General Ramsey Clark, Sena
tor Barry Goldwater, and Pollster
Samuel Larbell.

The topic for this year's program,
chaired by senior Matt Cole, of
Newnan, Ga., is “Crisis in Higher
Education” Dr, Henry Steele Com
mager, noted historian from Am-
herst College was the symposium’s
first speaker last fall.

Dr. Toole, who will present “Some
Comments on Student Revolu-
tionaries in Lee Chapel Monday
night, is the author of a highly criti-
cal letter about radical students,
“The Tyranny of Spoiled Brats.”
This statement of position was ori-
ginally written to his brother and
was reprinted in U.S. News and
World Report and in the Reader's

Digest after being circulated widely
in the nation’s newspapers.

Dr. Toole is Hammond professor
of western and American history at
Montana. He has been a teacher,
editor, author and is considered a
liberal on many political questions.

He is also former director of the
City of New York Museum and
museum director for the state of
New Mexico, and wrote “Montana:
An Uncommon Land,” published in
1959,

In the middle 1950s, he was co-
editor of “Montana Opinion,” a
newspaper designed to carry the
news that was allegedly suppressed
by the established news media. One
of his colleagues in that venture
was Dr. Milton Colvin, now profes-
sor of political science at Washing-
ton and Lee.

Luce, who describes himself as a
“right wing libertarian,” will present
‘a seminar on the crisis in education
at 4 p.m. Tuesday. Weinglass will
speak on “legal implications of stu-
dent unrest” in Tucker Hall at the
game time. At 7 p.m. that night there
will be cocktail parties and recep-
tions for both men; Luce at Sigma
Nu, Weinglass at Pi Kappa Alpha.
The debate, centering on “Deca-
dence and Recovery in American
Education: Who is Responsible?”
will follow at 8 p.m.

Hatfield, one of the best-known
members of congress, will be honor-
ed at a cocktail party at Psi Upsilon
ind will speak at 8:15.

The Senator is himself an educa-
tor, and was associate professor of
political science and dean of stu-
dents at Williamette University,
Salem, Ore., until 1956,

He placed Richard Nixon's name
in nomination for the presidency at

 

Dr. K. Ross Toole

the 1960 Republican National Con-
vention, and served as keynote speak-
er and temporary chairman at the
GOP’s convention four years later.

He is a member of the Senator's
Interior and Space Sciences Com-
mittees and the Select Committee on
Small Business.

Sen. Hatfield holds the B.A. de-
gress from Williamette and a mas-
ter’s degree from Stanford Univer-
sity. He has been awarded 20 hon.
orary doctorates.

Speakers slated for the second
week of this year’s expanded CON-
TACT program, are Dr. Charles
Hamilton of Columbia University, a
co-author with Stokley Carmichael
of Black Power: Politics of Libera-
tion in America, and Arthur Hansen,
President of the Georgia Institute of
Technology.

Representative Philip Crane (R-
Hl.) and Dr. Harald Taylor, former
President of Sarah Lawrence Col-
lege, will participate in a joint dis-
cussion to bring out their conflict-
ing educational philosophies on Fri
day, January 22.

Faculty Approves Course Changes
For History, Languages and P.E.

The faculty in its regular meeting
Tuesday paved the way for the initia-
tion of several new courses and also
derived a procedure for the election
of the 12 faculty representatives for
the newly created University Coun-
oil.

Approval went to a few course on
the Middle Ages, to two advanced
courses in Italian, and to a re-design
of the physical education curriculum.

“The Middle Ages” will be offered
on alternate years when the course
on the Renaissance is not scheduled,
starting in the spring term of 1972.
Both courses are to be staffed by an
imterdepartmental faculty.

The new Italian courses are the
third and fourth in that language (o

W. D. McHenry

Now Designated
Athletic Director

Washington and Lee has named
alumnus William D. (Bill) McHenry
director of athletics and head of the
department of physical education.

McHenry (presently is athletic di-
rector, chainman of the department
of physical education and head foot-
ball and lacrosse coach at Lebanon
Valley College in Annville, Pa. He
plans to remain at Lebanon Valley
until June 1, when he will assume
his full-time duties at W&L.

The 38-year-old Swarthmore, Pa.
native is a 1954 graduate of W&L,
where he was an outstanding center
on the Generals’ football teams of
1951, °52, and '53, and was a star
lacrosse player. He captained the
1953 football team, the last to play
under the University's program of
subsidized athletics. The next year,
W&L abandoned athletic scholar-
ships in favor of the present nonsub-
sidized program.

University President Robert E. R.
Huntley announced McHenry’s ap-
pointment to succeed Eugene F.
(Gene) Corrigan, who resigned in
October to become director of uni-
versity athletic programs at the Uni-
versity of Virginia on Jan. 1.

No acting director will be named
at Washington and Lee, President
Huntley said. McHenry will make
frequent periodic visits to Lexington
‘to give direction to the athletic pro-
gram during the five-month interim
period, and Richard Miller, assistant
athletic director, will provide ad-
ministrative continuity.

“We are delighted that Bill Mc-
Henry will be our new athletic direc-
tor,” Huntley said. “His experience
as an athletic director of a highly
successful program at Lebanon Va!-
ley, the high regard his colleagues
in athletics feel for him, and his ea-
thusiasm for our approach to col'ege
sports all commended him to us.”

The president said McHenry’s se-
lection was the culmination of sev-
eral months of careful and deliberate
evaluation of a large number of
candidates for the position. “We
were fortunate to have such a strong
group of candidates for our athletic
directorship,” he added. “We were

able to make our choice from a posi-
tion of real strength.”

In his 10 years at Lebanon Valley,
McHenry has coached football teams
to a 44-34-1 overall record, won one
Middle Atlantic Conference cham-
pionship and tied for another. His
lacrosse program, begun in 1966, has
posted a 30-14 overall mark, wit)
one MAC championship.

McHenry previously coached at
Penn Military College and at Wil-
liams,

Still trim at 6-3 and 215 pounds,
McHenry looks like he could still
fit into his W&L football uniform
After ‘being named W&L’s outstand-
ing major sport athlete in his senior
year, McHenry played in two post-
season contests, the 1953 Blue-Gray
Game and the 1954 College All-Star
Game against the Detroit Lions.

He was a sixth round draft choice
of the Washington Redskins and
played two years of service football
at Ft. Jackson ,S. C. before entering
the coaching ranks,

McHenry coached football, swim-
ming and track and directed the in-
tramural program at Penn Military,
then spent three years as lacross«
coach and freshman football coach
at Williams, leaving there in 1961
for his present post at Lebanon Val-
ley.

Long active in lacrosse circles, Mc-
Henry initiated the sport at Lebanon
Valley in 1966. He is the current
presidem and former treasurer of
the U. S. Lacrosse Coaches Associa-
tion. In 1961 he coached the North
‘cam in the annual North-South
College All-Star Game. The head
coach for the South was his younger
brother Bob, also a W&L alumnus
and now head lacrosse coach at Yale.

McHenry has directed a sports
camp in Bridgewater, Va. for sev-
eral years and also conducted a la-
crosse camp in Pennsylvania’s Poco-
no Mountains.

He received a B.S. degree in com-
merce at Washington and Lee in
1954 and has a masters degree in
education from the University of
Pennsylvania.

duPont Features New Exhibit

An exhibition of landscapes by
Patricia. Matson Thomas, instruc-
tor in art at Hollins College, is cur-
rently being presented in duPoat
Gallery.

Mrs. Thomas’ style is hardly in
the picture-postcard tradition, says
Dr. Gerard Doyon, professor of art.

She selects isolated figures and ob-
jects on the landscape which she
finds to be especially interesting, and
rearranges them in new and novel
compositions.

Each motif is recognizable enough.

Swede Henberg, President of the Student Body 1969-76

Dr. Doyon says—a tree here, a cow
there, rocks scattered about—but not
always as they are seen in nature.
Sometimes they are whole, some-
times fragmented, and sometimes
only pieces or details are represented.
Perspective is occasionally revers-
ed in Mrs. Thomas’ works, and laws
of gravity are broken. The result, ac-
cording to Dr. Doyon, is a landscape
which leaves much to the imagina-
tion—paintings, litographs, etchings.
and drawings which appeal to the in-
teHligence as well as to the fancy.

Mrs. Thomas is a graduate of
Mount Holyoke College and holds
both the M.A. and M.F.A. degrees
from the University of lowa. She has
studied at the Rhode Island School
of Design and the University of
Massachusetts as well.

Her prize-winning works have
been exhibited widely in New Eng-
land and the midwest, and she has
been awarded a number of grant;
and fellowships.

The gallery is open to the public
without charge cach weekday,

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

January 7, 1971

The Dean’s List-Honor Roll Craze

When grades are mentioned in any conversation, the sub-
ject is bound to be sticky at best. Yet we can't help wondering
why it was that about 200 students made the Honor Roll and
around 400 managed Dean's List in this, the first fall term at
W&L. We are not questioning W&L students’ capability of
attaining such academic honors, but the significance of those
honors in view of the large numbers receiving recognition.

Perhaps the reason behind this unusually large number of
honored students is due to the reduced course load which ai-
fords the students with the opportunity to take four courses in-
stead of the traditional five. Though the time period is lessened
between the beginning and the end of the term this year, stu-
dents still attend the same amount of class meetings for
their courses as they did under the old two semester system.

Or perhaps this large number is a result of increasing dili-
gence among students. Or maybe it could be that with the
more stringent requirements gone, students are choosing
courses in which they feel they are assured better grades. And
then again, it might be that more professors are grading more
leniently.

Whatever the reason, the phenomena of about one-half of
the student body population making a 3.0 or better moves us
to reconsider the requirements for Dean’s List and Honor
Roll. Somehow, being recognized on the Dean's List or the
Honor Roll is less impressive an academic honor when a
student is included in a group of about 600. And the signifi-
cance of the academic achievement is consequently lessened.

We recommend that the grade point average for Dean's
List and Honor Roll be changed for the next term. Dean's
List requirement should be a 3.2 grade point average; Honor
Roll ought to be awarded for a 3.6.

If Dean's List and Honor Roll are to be distinctive acade-
mic honors, it appears that the present requirements shoula
be changed, or else the honors will continue to be in the future
less significant and more perfunctory,

tured elsewhere on this page) that there will, indeed, be con-
certs and entertainment this year should come as welcome
news to all those who have paid their $40, and had begun to
give up hope, as well as to those who “didn’t get around to
buying a dance plan this year, but I really would like to go to
some of the concerts, etc., ete.”

That the number of students falling into the latter category
is larger this year than it has ever been is, we think, pretty
much of an open secret. That this development is in great mea-
sure responsible for the plight in which the dance board finds
itself is also generally understood. However, there are some
facts in this little matter which are not heard so often, nor,
possibly, so widely distributed, In order to present a clear pic-
ture of what the Dance Board is doing and why, it would be
best to give these latter considerations at least a cursory nod
of acquaintance,

To begin, then, the Dance Board has, by what Mr. Meem
has reported, done an impressive job, if not in capturing the
top names in the pop music field, at least in providing a little
something for almost every musical taste.

People are not going to come thundering down the roads to
Lexington from a radius of several hundred miles, but they
might come from several neighboring schools to see the con-
certs, and that is something. Nobody is going to ask Credence
to interrupt their busy schedule to come to Lexington, but
Poco will be here. James Taylor priced himself out of our
market, but his brother will be here, and again we submit that
the achievement is substantial.

The plan they have offered, two concerts on the weekend
of Feb. 5, the Poco concert Feb. 20, and the Sha-na-na concert
March 20, should be attractive to almost the entire student
body. However, as Mr. Meem explained in his letter, there is
a slight catch to it. It is this: no matter how much the student
body may be pleased and happy with the work turned in by
the Dance Board, no matter how good their intentions o fat-
tenidng most, some, or a few of the concerts might be, the law
of finances states that no body or organization can continue to
spend money indefinitely without having an income of some
sort, and escape some sort of serious mental, physical, or legal
trouble.

In short, if these concerts are not supported, the members
of the Washington and Lee student body can look forward to a
rather bleak and joyless short term, with musical interludes
provided only by the stereo, WREL, or humming softly to

Fancy Dress Dies Quietly

For the past 60 years ,the end of
January has meant two things here:
the end of the first academic semes-
ter and the Fancy Dress Ball, “out-
standing collegiate social event in
the South.”

This year, for the first time since
before World War I, the end of Janu-
ary will mean neither. It won't sig-
nify anything, except that February
is about to begin.

The end of January won't bring
eager young ladies from all over the
country whose hearts have been set
on “going to the Fancy Dress Ball”
the whole past 12 months, All the
end of January will bring is income
tax statements.

Of course, there will be dinces
and concerts and “big weekend,”
this winter. But they won't be
“Fancy Dress,” and so it won't be
the same.

Fancy Dress was a between-the-
semester diversion begun in 1907 as
a private costume party given by
Miss Annie White, the schcol’s li-
brarian. It is now the victim of edu-
cational progress.

You see, there is no longer a
January semester break at all. If
you want to be technical, there
aren't even semesters any more,
There are “terms,” and the first one
ends in December, and Christrnas
vacation follow, not the Fancy Dress
Ball. Students still take the same
number of classes a year, and there
are still as many weeks of school.

But now there isn't any room for
the Fancy Dress Ball.

WAL isn't geographically isolated
the way it used to be. When Fancy
Dress began, it was a rare occasion
when a girl could make the trip
across the mountains for a date.
Now, though, with airplaines and ‘n-
terstates, a date is hardly a onc2-a-
semester treat.

Just as important, Washington
and Lee isn't the only school to di-
vide #ts year into terms of unequal
length instead of semesters. Girls
all over the country—the daughters
of the girls who used to charier
whole railroad cars to come to Lex-
ington for Fancy Dress from New

BY ROBERT BAROODY

There has been a diarrhea of opi-
nion about the “Love Story” pheno-
menon, Especially noted is the fact
that the familiar “Now a Paramount
motion picture starring .. .” is more
than deceit: “Love Story” was con-
ceived of as a soreenplay, made into
an Ali McGraw movie, and finally
published as the one hundred thirty-
one page bestseller, Next, of course
the critics attempt to explain the
success of “Love Story” (or rather
that of scriptwriter-novelist Brich
Segal) in the context of some sort
of neo-romentic trend that seems to
have salvaged the torn psyche of
“Vieinamized” America

Now | am not a snob, Segal’
story-telling style is almost admirable
in its modern simplicity; and the
film, faithful to that same simplicity,
is technically proficient but not ela
borate .1f anyone deserves to be chas-
tised for the “Love Story” pheno
menon, it is the American public
More than purchasing the five mil
lion paperback copies or flocking to
the film, it is their determination
that “Love Story” offers The Truth
which I find so nauseating. There is
nothing tragic or cosmic in the anti
septic death of Jenny. We must take
“Love Story” for what it iss a mind

On Rising Sap

Orleans, Louisville, Atlanta, Chic-
ago——don't have a January beak
any longer, either,
Everybody agrees your education-
al opportunities are better this way.
But even so, you can't help feel-
ing that doesn't really make up for
giving up the Fancy Dress Ball.
Back in the olden days, not every-
body felt that way. The lute Dr.
Ollinger Crenshaw, Washington and
Lee’s noted historian, reported that
soon after the Ball was born a cer-
tain professor of Greek was moved
‘by the goings-on at one Fancy Dress
to condemn publicly “moderr-siyle
dancing” — performed beyond the
sight of chaperones, the strait-laced
educator took pains to point out—
as well as “the indecency of attire.”
If he didn’t like it then, he would
probably be overjoyed now to know
that there is no more Fancy Dress.
So would the students who, in 1919,
passed a resolution denouncing “all
distasteful and exaggerated forms of
dancing such as the ‘shimmy’.” And
80 too, if he were around, might the
administrator who banned the Big
Apple from Washington and Lee in
the 1920s as a moral outrage.

But those types were few and far
between, The ones who loved Fancy
Dress were legion—whole 2enera-
tions of students and faculty and ad-
ministrators, not to mention their
ladies.

By 1913, Annie White's “Ba! Mas-
que” had already become a tradition
That year, “the largest assemblage of
college girls ever seen in Lexington”
attended the Ball— 300 “blooming
and pretty young lady students,’ ac-
cording to a chronicler of that day.
They were accompanied, he hasten-
ed to add, by “three lady instructors.”

The themes at Fancy Dress were
as elaborate as student minds could
conceive. They spent months, liter-
ally, re-creating European courts of
the Gilded Age, magnificent ante-
bellum plantations, majestic casinos,
one year even Heaven itself,

They spent still more time on the
figures, those intricate musical pro-
cessions of students and dates in
conyplex, carefully planned designs

less little diversion as important to
our lives as was the hula-hoop.

Withdrawn from their fantastic,
mutually infatuated world, the char-
acters of Oliver and Jenny appeas
to be pathetic. Have you ever con-
sidered the Barrett's future had
Jenny lived? Maybe Jenny would
have written “The Diary of A Mad
Housewife;” or maybe, just maybe,
Oliver would have become Presiden
of the United Siaies . . . or at least
Auorney General.

lt is too much, however, to ask
for intelligence and emotion. The
dominant emotion, | suspect, being
self pity. What else could empty the
lear ducts of pubescent teeny-bop
pers and menopausal spinsters alike?
Tere is no perfection and litile
beauty in their lives. Thank God for
escapism!

Why this outpouring of venom?

Well, friends, the time is terribiy
out of joint for us to adere some
thing so puerile as “Love Story.’

One early year, every student at
Washington and Lee marched in the
figure. (There is no record of who
was left to watch.) Their dates ali
wore hats of certain colors, and
when they were done they had forn:-
ed into the university's crest, hardly
a simple pattern.

In the thirties, Fancy Des, be-
came to American college girls what
the Ascot Gavotte was io Eliza
Doolittle. The radio networks al-
ways broadcast it—‘live from Lex-
ington, Virginia!”"—and if you were
a big-band leader you knew you
hadn't made it yet if you hadn't
played the Fancy Dress Ball.

There are still big bands. But it's
not the same as it was in the heyday
of Miller and the Dorseys and Guod-
man and Harry James and Glen
Gray and Artie Shaw. Radio is still
around too. But not like it was with
The First Nighter and Amos ‘n’
Andy and Easy Aces.

And there are still social events.
But, sadly to be sure, there isn't
anything left quite like the old Fancy

LETTERS TO

‘Conventional’ Dress?

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

You are correct in assuming that
former alumni will question what
has happened to the reputation of
Washington and Lee University. The
students make the school and. con-
sequently, the reputation. However,
those who believe that the casual
(sloppy) dress reflects the loss of
personal and school pride are guilty
of the “pathetic fallacy” you attri-
bute to those who dress to be.ome
“au courant.” Perhaps those who
judge on such a scale are not worth
impressing.

| was also troubled by your edi-
torial’s statement pertaining to the
wppearance of our students at the
basketball game. The mode of dress
did not affect the team's perform-
ance as proven by the victory. You
stated that our students looked as if
they should have been from Buena
Vista, This remark bothered me far
more than anything else you said.
Just because 60 per cent of the fam-
ilies in Rockbridge County have a
yearly income of under $5090 and
can not afford $100 herring bone
suits does not mean that they ae
worthy of derogatory statements that
somehow imply that they are inferior
and less deserving of respect than
we pampered students. Perhaps they
could look richer if the demand for
hous ng Was not so great (a problem
to which WAL students contribute
immensely).

| am a sloppy dresser for the fol-
lowing reasons:

1) | dress to be comfortable.

2) | do not wish to be arrested
for indecent exposure.

3) T am guilty of the “pathetic
fallacy.” First, | want peuple to
know that I believe traditions, those
natural enemies of logic and raorm
(pardon the allegory), are of nu use
im an institution where progres: is a
basic goal, Second, | want people to
know that I'm not a conservative
(guess I'm an effete snob), Third, 1
elways thought that students who
wore jackets and ties were brown-
nosing the teachers (a carry-ove: of
my high school days). Fourth, I'm
nm proud that I'm given enough
nom’ to stuff my already owetlen
stomach while others in America ore
starving. Hypocritically, | ail! take
the money and look the ocher was

Frosh Analyzed
In National Test

More than a third of Washington
and Lee University’s freshmen plan
to become lawyers and a sixth of
them say they want to be physicions,
according to a survey taken last tall
by the American Council on Educa-
tion.

With 36.4 per cent choosing law
as a profession and 15.7 per cent
medicine, the figures at Washington
and Lee are substantially higher than
nationwide averages, the Council re-
ported,

Nationally, its survey showed 6.3
per cent of America’s freshmen as
future lawyers and 5.2 per cent as
physicians,

Only a tenth of the freshmen at
Washington and Lee have jawyers
for fathers, and the fathers of even
fewer are doctors or dentists.

With law and medicine together
claiming more than half of the 372
Washington and Lee freshmen who
participated in the survey—18 did
not take part—business as a pro-
fession ran a poor third, with only
10.1 per cent of the universiiy’s
freshmen interested in it. That was
considerably behind the national
male freshman average, 16.7 per
cent,

The fourth most popular occup:-
tional category at Washington and
Lee, judging by freshman plans, was
the arts. Almost 9 per cent said they
plan to become artists or performers,
double the national proportion.

Washington and Lee’s freshmen
‘parted company with entering stu-
dents elsewhere in the nation in sev-
eral other characteristics as well, the
American Council's survey showed.

More than a sixth of them, 17.7
per cent, were editors of their sec-
ondary school newspaper, twice the
national men’s proportion.

Nearly half, 45.2 per cent, be-
longed to a scholastic honor society,
and 18.5 per cent won National
Merit Scholarship recognition ---
again, doubling the national propor-
tions for male freshmen.

Twenty-two per cent had A aver-
ages in high school, compared with
just 13 per cent nationally, and four-
fifths of the rest had B averages.

But despite major differences in
career plans and scholastic back-
grounds, Washington and Lee’s fresh-
men were close to national averages
in political and social notions.

Only a tiny minority at Washing-

(Continued on Page 4)

pride is justified by the way anycne
dresses.

In conclusion, a number of WAL
freshmen applied in spite of the con-
servative atmosphere that permeates
this campus. Mr. Editor, you dress
your way and I'll dress mine. You
wear a jacket and tie while I wear
“jeans (with at least one rip in the
knee), no socks (except in designat-
ed winter months), no tie, and a
shirt (perfectly wrinkled).” Do and
impress whoever you want, but, as
for me, “I'm gonna wave my freak
flag high.”

Boo’s For B-Ball Buffs
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Last month at the varsity baskel-
ball game, I was the unhappy wit-
ness of an appalling sort of specta-
tor conduct. The sound of a referee's
whistle invariably produced a Palo-
vian thunder of boo's and vile epit-
hets from the over-ardent W&L
rooters.

kt did not even matter who the
call was on; the result was the same.
If, as it often was, the call was
against Lynchburg, the hecklers
would change their hoots, in mid-
breath, to “Alright!”, “It's about
time, ref!", “Right on!", “Pinally
got you S4!", and the like. The ac-
tion and physical exertion off the
court rivaled the game, as the root-
ers never-<easingly mercilessly mock-

Dance Board Plans

During the past few weeks | have
been approached by a number of
students desiring to know what en-
tertainmemt the Dance Board has
planned for the winter term, In or-
der to answer questions regarding
the Dance Board's rather nebulous
aotivities I felt that a letter of clari-
fication was necessary.

For this term's concert weekends
we have contracted a variety of
groups that encompass neerly the
emire gamut of students’ eniertain-
ment preferences, The first “big
weekend” of the winter term will be
that of February Sth and 6th. On
Friday night the Allman #rothers
Band of Macon, Georgia will satidy
the musical tastes of the “light rock”
aficionados

Roundballers Rally, Deliver
Emory & Henry Its Ninth Loss

BY PALMER TRICE

Wednesday night marked the re-
turn of the Generals to the victory
column. They notched a 90-58 win
over the Emory and Henry Wasps.
W&L looked very impressive in their
first showing of the new semester.
Despite a three week layoff, or per-
haps because of it, the Blue found a
previous lacking zing. They looked
crisp.

The New Year renewed club spir-
its, whiich had fallen to a record low
after their disappointing loss to
Hampden-Sydney’s Tigers. In this
outing, our ball club took an 83-79
knock on the chin. While they did
hustle, the lid stayed on the basket
for most of the game. The Tigers
threatened to run away with the
contest for much of the game. A
late spurt brought the club within
sight of victory, but it fell short.
This game proved the old adage—
any team can beat any other team
on a given night, Wait til they come
to Doremus.

The Wasps came into last night's
‘ball game having played six games
since the home team’s last outing.
Emory and Henry carried a meagre
3-8 record into the battle, but have
shown signs of improvement since
an 0-5 start.

The Generals have been practic-
ing since the beginning of 1971.
Their practices have been spirited,
and so was their game performance.
Coach Canfield inserted two new
starters into the 1971 version of the
roundballers. Hatton Smith and, for
the first time, Dave Stone replaced
Ellie Gutshall and injured Charlie
Strain, Hatton, the quickest man on

the squad, ran the ball club like a
pro.

Mr. Stone, the hardened veteran
of last year's campaign, showed how
he earned his letter by tossing in a
game high total of 20 points. Dave
shot a blistering 60% from the floor.
He was 2 for 2 from the foul line.
He will provide a much needed scor-
ing punch for the General’s attack.

Tall Paul McClure led our of-
fense in the first half with 13 points.
He also led the squad to a 75-47 ad-
vantage on the boards. A sterling
performance by the ‘big man.

Team captain Mike Daniel went
into the game with a 20.2 average.
He came up with 15 big ones, He
led the tenacious defense that let the
usually high scoring Wasps put but
19 points on the board during the
first half. The crowd never got to
see if their team was out of shape, 1s
10 boys got a chance to play in the
first half. Everyone ‘but Charlie
Strain played. A turned ankle pre-
vented Charlie from breaking out of
his December slump. Maybe next
time Charlie?

Analyzing the victory, two points
stand out in particular. The ball
club displayed a new, or previously
hidden team pride. The boys were
on the floor afiter the ball. To put it
simply, they hustled like they have
never hustled this season. Mel Cart-
right, an All-American here last year,
summed up the second reason when
he said that they were the least sel-
fish team that he had seen, almost
to a fault.

This was the Generals’ best per-
formance of the season. They shot a
respectable 40% from the floor. Mc-

Clure and Co. controlled the boards,
rarely letting the Wasps get a second
or third shot. Emory and Henry shot
only 28%, mostly due to a brilliant
team defense. Everyone played, and
everyone scored. Even though the
bench was emptied, the defense never
lagged.

The squad leaves today for St.

the first round of the Concoast

feated.

will be the Dance Board’s answer to
James Taylor. On that night James’
younger brother Livingston [aylor
will entertain us with the songs which
are native to his North Carolina
background. Livingston's perform-
ance should appease those who de-
sired to see James here at W&L.

Later in the month on February
20th the rising country-rock group,
Poco, will visit Doremus gym for a
lively Saturday night conceri. This
group acclaimed by * Playboy” maga-
zine to be one of the fastest rising
rock groups around puts on a show
equaled only by Three Dog Night
or Credence Clearwater Pevival.

To wrap up the winter term we
will swing back to the music of the
late 50's with Sha-na-na on Satur-
day, March 20th. This anomaly of
Woodstock should appeal to all
those who are still in a limbo be
tween soul and rock music.

If student response to these “big
weekends” is financially satisiactory
the Dance Board hopes to provide
ene more “big weekend” in cither
late April or early May. However,
such a weekend will materialize only
if enough people buy dance plans or
purchase tickets at the door to the
winter concerts to make financing
of a spring term weekend poss'ble.

Presently, we are doing our very
best to provide a maximum number
of quality entertainers with our
rather dubious financial budget.
Hopefully, your support of the win-
ter term's concerts will make the

addition of a spring term weekend a
reality instead of a mere dream,

seen such conduct condoned, even
by the youth. The conduct dismally
reminded me of the senseless crowds
drooling over the gladiators in 4
Roman coliseum.

There is no value in sports when
sportsmanship is lost. Then sports
resemble a controlled war like the
great game played in Vietnam. Such
conduct is hardly sportsmanlike.
Nor does it befit the so called W&L
“gentleman”.

The remaining nine faculty rep-
resentatives will be elected by the
faculty as a whole from those mem-
bers who do not serve on any of
the above committees.

The speed with which the Unive:
‘ty takes form now rests largely
with the student E.C. The 12 s.u-
dent members of the University
Council will be elected in the neu:
future in a manner not yet Jeter-
mined.

In addition to the 12 faculty and
12 student members on the Council.
ex officio members will be the uni-
versity president, the student body
president, the dean of students, and
the deans of the College, the School
of Law, and the School of Com
merce, Economics, and Politics.

“We expect the University Coun-
cil’s first meeting to be some time
prior to the March faculty mee‘ing,”
said Lewis G. John, dean of studen!:.
“The meetings will probably be at
jeast once a month, to append or en-
dorse faculty committee recommen
dations.”

According to Dean John the fac-
ulty representatives will be deter-
mined by the February faculty meet-
ing.

Leiters To The Editor . . .

 

Reader Speaks

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

It's been a peaceful year here, and
there is nothing wrong with peace.
But, we sit here in our semi-haven
university and not look at what
seems to me a world spiralling down-
ward. What is wrong with us? Jt
doesn't have to be that way. I know
many people are involved in various
worthy activities. I also realize that
some people think that college stu-
dents can have little effect on world
affairs,

But now I wonder; do we care?

Senator Mark Hatfield will speak at W&L next week.

Jessup Court Team Picked

Four law students—William D.
Elliot, Lawrence E. Morhous, Ro-
bert B. Schatz, IL], and Parker S.
Wise, Jr.—have been selected to
represent Washington and Lee in
the 1971 Phillip C. Jessup Inter-
national Law Moot Court Competi-
tion,

The team, the first ever entered
by Washington and Lee, is sponsored
by the newly-formed Society of In
ternational Law. The regional com-

petition will be held on March 20-21

at a location yet to be announced.

The annual competition, establish-
ed in 1961, is sponsored by the As-
sociation of Student International
Law Societies and the American
Society of International Law. This
year’s problem encompasses issues
of aircraft hijacking, murder, kid-
napping, and extradition.

The selection of the team was
under the direction of Professor
Lawrence D. Gaughan, sponsor of
the Society of International Law.
The team members are all second-
year law students,

Do we really want to come t. grips
with what is going on outside of a

not, the world is going on and while
we wait for the future when we will
be “in the world,” our futures are
being determined, if not ruined,
now,

Now, and what do we care’ The
old line “War, Pollution, Poverty,

we sincerely want to.

IN JOINT

On Class of ’73

This report on the activities of
ithe Sophomore Class thus far this
year is being made in hopes of in-
forming and arousing interest in
‘the Sophomore Class by its mem-
bers. On November 17th, a Sopho-
more Class meeting was called to:
(1) find out the general attitude of
ithe Sophomore Class (2) to report on
the budget of the class and (3) to
announce that applications were be-
ing accepted for a Sophomore com-
mittee which would decide how the
surplus money would be used and
which weu!ld hopefully draw the
class closer, together.

Having left the freshman dorms,
students live in a widespread area
and many have contact with the
people they knew as Freshmen. We
find it increasingly difficult to get a
true picture of the class’ needs and
desires. It is our hope that through
this committee we can regain the
sense of unity our class had as fresh-
men,

At the class meeting we had a

ll tunn-out. A total of 18 pe»
ple came. Some people later remark-
ed that they didn't see the posters,
but for the most part, the small at-
tendance was due to the age-old
problem of apathy. Last year our
Freshman class displayed more unity
than most classes ever do; but it ap-
pears that this year, having lost the
day to day associations we had in
the dorms, that our class is gradually
developing the W&L tradition of
apathy.

The following was discussed at the
Sophomore class meeting: (1) The
Budget: $2300 was collected in class
dues and was spent in the following
manner:

$1321.00 for grain

$ 300.00 for the band

$ 40.44 for cups

$ 76.80 for mix

$ 27.09 trash cans and servers
$ 26.00 for ice

$ 12.50 for posters

$ 12.50 for a garden hose

for a total of $1,816.33.

Left in the class treasury is ap-
proximately $500 and (2) How to
use the surplus money? We have
thought of four possibilities: (a) We
can pool our money with the Junior
class and turn the Springs Weekend
cocktail party into a semi-rock festi-
val with four or five good bands and
a bar, (b) hold a sophomore class
party with a good band and set-ups

Contact Studies High

BY SKIP PAUKERT

A nationally prominent history
professor, an advocate of the New
Right, and a lawyer from the New
Left were featured in the opening
programs of “Contact '71” this week.
All three gentlemen addressed them-
selves to topics related to this year’s
theme, “the Crisis in Education.”

“Contact,” an annual symposium
on contemporary issues and prob-
lems, offered its initial presentation
Monday with Dr. K. Ross Toole.
The “Contact” speeches will con-
tinue through next week.

Dr. Toole, a professor of history
at the University of Montana, re-
ceived national attention with the
publication of his article, “The Ty-
ranny of Spoiled Brats,” in several
national periodicals,

Dr. Toole demonstrated himself
to be much of a political liberal in
his views on current issues. He ad-
dressed his speech “to those of you
who may be thinking about giving
up on the system.” He emphasized
that the American political scheme
was imperfect and that reforms were
badly needed, both in foreign and
domestic policy, but he urged that
change must come peacefully and

that recourse to violence was
real alternative.”

Toole pointed to the gathering at
Woodstock as an example of the

latent solidarity and power of youth

“no today. “You must learn the poi'tical

process, and you must learn how to
utilize power,” he said.

Toole criticized student activists
today for being, above all, “myopic.”

Watt Appointed College Dean;
Pusey Steps Down To Teach

The President of the University
announced Monday that Dr. Wil-
liam J. Watt will accept the duties of
Dean of the College, effective next
July 1. He succeeds Dean William
Webb Pusey III, who is returning to
full-time teaching after 11 years of
service as head of the university's
arts and sciences division.

It was revealed that Dean Pusey
had indicated his desire to return to
the chassroom to the Board of Trus-
tees last summer, He will resume his
duties as professor and chairman of
the German Department.

Dr. Watt presently serves as as-
sociate dean of the College. There
was no suggestion as to when or
how a successor will be named to
that post.

Dr. Watt has been a member of
the faculty since 1955. He received
a Bachelor of Science Degree from
the University of Minos in 1949, a
master’s degree from Cornell Uni-
versity in 1951, and his Ph. D. from
Cornell in 1956,

Dr. Pusey came to Washington
and Lee in 1939, the year he earned
his Ph.D. degree from Columbia
University. He also holds a B. S. de-
gree from Haverford College and
an M.A, degree from Harvard.

He served as Acting President of
the University from late 1967 unti
President Huntley took office on
February 5, 1968.

In Monday's announcement Presi-
dent Huntley offered his “deep zrati-
tude—and that of all associated

 
 

with Washington and Lee—to Dr.
Pusey for his decade of invaluable
service as dean.” He added that Or.
Pusey’s “patient and thoughtful lea/-
ership has given the university a
quality of true academic strength,
which will be abiding.”

The selection of Dr. Watt to as-
sume duties as dean of the College,
the president said, “commends itself
on every ground—ability, scholar-
ship, experience.”

er Education

He traced the history of the labor
and farm movements in the United
States, and the reforms brought
about by LaFollette’s Progress ves
and the labor unions, “But you must
have patience, courage, and, »bove
all, tenacity,” he continued.

Toole urged that students begin
to exercise their potent power by
using such tools as the boycott. In
answer to a question on national
priorities, he listed (1) the eradica-
tion of poverty, (2) the preservation
of the ecology, and (3) the resiora-
tion of universities as teaching in-
stitutions,

In answer to another question,
Toole advocated the immediate with-
drawal of U.S, forces from Vietnam,
saying “I haven't met a hawk in

three years.”

Tuesday brought the pairing of
two very unique speakers having a
mutually extensive background in
radical movements. Philip Abbott
Luce, a former Communist and rev-
olutionary, broke with the Left in
1965 and turned to the right wing,
culminating in his work with the
Young Americans for Freedom as
head of their college division.

Leonard Weinglass, an attorney
for many of the nations most promi-
nent leftists, was co-counse! for the
defense with William Kunstler at the
“Chicago 8” trial.

Mr. Luce began his day on camp-
us with a seminar in the afternoon
in the Student Center library, where
he recounted his political evolution
from editor of the national organ of
the communist Progressive Labor
Party to an advocate of rightist lib-
ertarianism.

Luce oniticized the coercive nature
of the state in many elements of
American life, especially education.
In his speech in Lee Chapel Tues-
day evening, he prefaced his re-
marks by saying, “the whcle of the
public educational system is deca-
dem, and we are in need of revoiu-
tionary ideas.”

“I oppose state education because
of its very nature,” he said. Not only

did he think that governmental von-
trol kept down the potential quality
of education, but also “it ‘s implicit
in that educational process that there
is an attempt to indoctrinate stu-
dents in an allegiance to the
state...”

He emphasized the importance of
the years in a child's life from ages
1-5, which are wasted under the
status quo. He also characterized
the 12 years of public primary and
secondary education as “to a large
degree, simply a device to keep you
off the streets,”

Troubs Offer

New Drama

In Shakespeare's “Hamlet” there
are two minor characters which have
little to do with the action of the
Bard’s most famous tragedy. Rosen-
crantz and Guildenstern are two
gentlemen who are appointed by the
King of Denmark to discover the
cause of Hamlet's madness.

They are dead by the conclusion
of the play.

Tom Stoppard’s “Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead” focuses on
the fate of this hapless pair. It is a
comedy, however, and it will be per-
formed here on February 9 through
13 by the Troubadour Theatre.

“Auditions were, thankfully, in
December,” said Mrs. Bilen Barnes,
director for the production. Speak
ing of the rehearsals, Mrs. Barnes
noted that “we're not there yet, but
we're on our way.”

The cast has been in rehearsal for
the production since before the
Christmas holidays. Which is as it
should be, for the Troubadour
Theatre plans to take the show on a
tour to other colleges in Virginia be-
fore it comes home to W&L for 4
five night run. Performances of “Ro-
sencrantz and Guildenstern” will be
given at Mary Baldwin, Randolph
Macon, Roanoke College, Radford,
and the University of Richmond
during its run on tour February 2
through the 6th.

_Stoppard’s play weaves the scripi
of “Hamlet” throughout the course
of his comedy. Yet the action of the
play centers primarily on the comic
and sometimes pathetic befuddle-
mem of Rosencrantz and Guilden
stern as they attempt to unravel the
mystery of their situation in the in-
trigue of the court of Denmark.

“I suppose I would be lying to
anyone if I told them | totally Un-
derstood the play,” said Mrs, Barnes
“I think it’s a brilliant piece, but |
don't think anyone would be telling

REVIEW and OUTLOOK What Has Gone Before, Is Yet To Come...

Five Speakers Remaining To Fill Toole, Luce, Weinglass Launch
Program, ‘Crisis In Education’ Symposium With Lecture, Debate

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Wednesday, January 13, 1971

Our Mini-‘Crisis In Education’

Interesting isn’t it, that with the beginning of “Contact thy”
we have had the appearance of a group which sat in the Co-op
this week asking for signatures to end R.O.T.C. credit at the
University. It would seem that the members of this group were
attempting to create its own mini-“Crisis in Education” in
order to make “Contact '71” more “relevant.”

Apart from the fact that they're belatedly attempting to get
into the act along with the distinguished speakers W&L is
fortunate enough to have here during this week, this group of
students seems to have a murky conception of the word “edu-
cation,” hence the mini-crisis.

The demand for the elimination of academic credit for
R.O.T.C. is as absurd as the demand that a study of the Re-
naissance be put to a vote of the gtudent body to test its “rele-
vancy.” The points is, education is not democratic or even a
matter of casting a vote for or against one course. If it were,
there would be several students we know who'd vote against
courses throughout the school because of the grade they re-
ceived last term or because they thought the professors too
liberal, too dull, or too conservative.

We doubt that many of the people in this group are enrolled
in R.O.T.C. We doubt that they would appreciate it if people
fro mother persuasions started a petition to eliminate philoso-
phy or english or politics or drama credit. “Relevance” cannot
be defined by one’s own personal perspective. If it were, then
there would be no courses at W&&L offered for credit. The
armed forces (fortunately or unfortunately) are as much of the
reality of everyone's common experience here and elsewhere as
is the question of the economic future of the United States. The
problem students have to cope with is not whether R.O.T.C.
should be offered for credit, but whether or not they should
take R.O.T.C. for credit.

(It amuses us that no moral arguments would likely be
raised at all if there weren't a war going on somewhere which
threatened the immediate future of students on this campus.
The moral arguments take the stand that R.O.T.C. is not aca-
demic, but the real motivation behind this argument is anti-
war beliefs of this group of students.)

The real crisis in the educational system today is the misuse
of the word “education.” We hope that tempests in teapots
such as the thinly disguised political line “end R.O.T.C. credit”
will not affect the bright future education has here.

The Craze: Retrospective

It tends to be that our arithmetic was slightly in error last

week.

200 Honor Roll students

+400 Dean's List students

=Not 600 but 400 Honor Roll and Dean's List students.

So our casual estimate of one-half of the student body mak-
ing Dean's List and Honor Roll is reduced to 36 percent. Even
with this reduced percentage, the significance of this marked
rise in figures is not diminished. We reiterate our proposal that
requirements for Dean's List should be changed from 3.0 to
3.2 and those for Honor Roll from 3.5 to 3.6.

Especially in view of the fact that the Class of 1971 was one
of the contributing factors in the rise of the percentage for this
term. 162 out of the 262 members of the class made a GPR of
3.0 or above, with 73 seniors on the Honor Roll. One wonders
whether the overall intelligence of the senior class has mel-
lowed with age here at W&L. Whether it has or not is a moot
point. However, we think the more stringent requirements for
recognition of academic distinction are necessary and valid,

Dropping Drop-Add Bureaucracy

In the past four years, this paper has seen an incredible
amount of change. Some of it has been good, some bad, but at
least the driving motive has been one of improvement. One
can look back and be proud of the fact that we have changed.

But in all our change something seems to have been left
untouched. It recurs twice annually, but the aggravation ts
short-lived and goes before one has time to really notice it,
generally speaking. However, we have had trouble with it, and
it has remained in our minds,

It is not uncommon to spend two days changing one’s
schedule. One must first track down at least four signatures
whose authors always seem to be away, After walking from
the two course professors, the student must go to the Dean
and waste his time making sure that everything is all right
To add insult to injury, the course changes cost $5

In a school that prides itself on a personal touch, and in a
.chool where data processing is used quite efficiently in an ad
ministrative capacity, it seems absurd that the archaic system
of course changes is allowed to exist as it does

The funny thing is that the needed change ts really quite
simple, All the student should have to do is go to his advisor
and ask for the change. If the Deans feel it is necessary to make
sure everything is functioning properly, they should have a list
of changes sent to them

I'm sure that less than five per cent of the course changes
are in error in some way (besides actual mistakes on the Drop
\dd slips). This school must take in a couple of thousand dol
lars on course changes, Well, maybe taht’s permissible, but the
fee should not be used as a deterrent

Washington and Lee’s CONTACT
‘71 symposium, focusing on the gen-
eral theme, “The Crisis in Educa-
tion,” will continue with a broad
cross-section of speakers.

Friday night Dr. Charles Hamil-
ton of Columbia University will
speak in Lee Chapel. Dr. Hamilton
will discuss “Ohanging and Ex-
panding Curricula for Blacks and
Whites.”

Hamilton, professor of Urban
Studies at Columbia, was co-author
with Stokeley Carmichel of Black
Power: Politics of Liberation in
America. A discussion period will
follow the address.

On Monday, U.S. Senator Mark
O. Hatfield, (R.-Ore) will offer an
address in Evans Dining Hall. Hat-
field, prominent member of the Sen
ate and co-sponsor of a controver-
sial Cambodian legislation is for-
imerly an associate professor and
dean of students at Williamette Uni-
versity in Salem, Oregon.

Hatfield, whose recent bout with
flu necessitated a change in the ori-
ginal CONTACT ‘71 schedule, will
be the guest of honor at a cocktail
party at the Psi Upsilon House start-
ing at 7 p.m. His speech will be fol-
lowed by a question and answer
period.

The Senator is expected to speak
en “Reordering Our Priorities: In-
creased Aid to Higher Education.”

On Tuesday, Dr. David Donald,
the Harry G. Black Professor of His-
tory at The Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, and a Pulizter Prize winner,
will deliver the Lee’s Birthday,
Founer's Day Convocation at noon
in Evans Hall.

CONTACT resumes on Wednes-
day, January 20 with the appear-
ance of Dr. Arthur Hansen, presi-
dent of the Georgia Institute of
Technology. Hansen, described by
CONTACT chairman Madison Cole
as a “dynamic speaker” will address
himself to the topic, “Technology,
Our Terror or Our Triumph,”

The symposium will conclude on
Friday, January 22, with the joint
appearance of Rep. Philip Crane,
(R.-Il.) and Dr. Harald Taylor.

Crane, a prominent conservative,
was elected to the Senate in 196).
Taylor was formerly president of
Sarah Lawrence College, and he was
noted for innovations, among them
the “Free University” concept. He
is the author of Students Without
Teachers: The Crisis in the Univer-
sity.

Both men will conduct afternoot
seminars, Crane in Reid Hall, and
Taylor in the University Center Li-
brary.

Dr. Taylor will be honored at ¢
cocktail party at the Phi Kappa Sig-
ma house at 7 p.m.

Contact chairman Matt Cole urges
all students to make the fullest use
of the opportunities presented by
this year’s symposium possible. The
fact that the student body finances
this annual event through direct dues

and IFC co-sponsorship means that
the speakers visit the campus for
the benefit of all students.

The support of the student body
will mean that in the future we can
enjoy programs such as this, and
can continue to attract key people in
the country to the symposium.

However, to provide speakers such
as Dr. Hamilton, Sen. Hatfield, Dr.
Donald, Dr. Hansen, Rep. Crane,
Dr. Taylor, Mr. Luce, Mr. Wein-
glass and Dr. Toole, as well as men
in the past, such as Sen. Goldwater,
Sen. McGovern, and then-ex-Vice
President Nixon, Contact chairmen
must be able to assure the men of
widespread student attendance and
attention,

BY DAVID OLSON

In the past two evenings “Con-
tact” has provided us with two very
different forms of discussion, one in-
telligent and enlightening the other
bland and embarrassing. Surprising-
ly enough they came from the
sources we least expected.

Last night in Lee Chapel Philip
Luce and Leonard Weinglass en-
gaged in something less than a de-
‘bate. I fully expected a knock-down-
drag-out affair but was pleasantly
surprised with the civility and per-
ception of the participants. Anyone
who was there will attest to the fact
that there seemed to be little dis-
agreement on most of the issues be-
tween Weinglass and Luce, It 15 in-

Radio ‘Shadow’

“Who knows what evil lurks in
the hearts of men? .. . The Shadow
knows, ...”

These few words, coming over the
old crystal radio set, were enough to
send audiences of the late °30's, the
‘40's, and the early ‘50's into fit. of
scurrying and jockeying for position
to hear the latest installment of the
weekly serial

Now, so that presumably The

in the hearts of WAL students, the

such as Agnes Morehead and the

Feb. 23——-NEVER GIVE A SUCK-

Fields, Glorma Jean, Lion Errol

“Anyone who hates dogs and chil

The W&L Film Committee will
hold an informal discussion to select
films for the remainder of the year
on Thursday, at 7 p.m. All interesied
people are urged to come to the
Cockpit,

teresting to note that in many ways
we saw a result of two peopie who
are described as “left” and “right”
coming into agreement because they
have come full circle on the political
spectrum, which is, in my way., re-
assuring. Restricting themselves, for
the most part, to the field of educa-
tion, they made some very important
points. Luce in his opening renvaerks
made the point that public education
in America has failed and thar it
exists primarily for the benefit and
continuance of the state. It feil upon
Weinglass to defend the state and
the necessity for the state to be re-
sponsive. This struck me as strange
coming from a member of the “New
Left.” It seems to me that if any-
thing revolutionary groups, whom
Mr. Weinglass counts as his clients,
are Opposed to the monolith that is
the government. But the basic point
remains that Mr. Weinglass and Mr.
Luce are both opposed to the form
the government has taken today and
especially in its relation to educa-
tion.

I would have to draw as ther
point of disagreement their attitudes

bout what the new posture of edu
cation and of government should be.
Mr. Luce made it quite chear that he
feels that an attitude of laissezfaire
towards education is necessary. He
felt that the parents should take up
the total responsibility for their chil-
dren’s education. Mr. Weinglass
countered with the salient point that
thi swould be difficult if not impos-
sible to accomplish in the Black
community or in Poverty areas,
Weinglass felt that the state is noi
teaching what is relevant or impor-
tant. He felt that in our “post-in-
dustrial” world we must be open to
anything and everything for our edu-
gation to be effective. He also
brought up the point of community
in relation to the campus environ-
ment. He said that four years in co!
lege isolate us from our communit:
and leave us in a limbo that we
never really get out of. This i:ola-
tion resulis in the creation of an
elite and an elite that is not in com-
munication with the other segments
of the society.

What one came out with here is
that education is primarily a tool
of the state so the siate can continue.
It is obvious that they both are dis-
enchanted with their education and
the one we are receiving. Luce’s
thesis that we should adopt a laisse ’-
faire policy is to me misguided and
can only end in greater disassocia
tion between individuals and be-
tween individuals and the society
itself. Weinglass was far more hon-
est about the role of the state and
the necessity for the slate to reform
so that it can educate with openness,
and effoct-veness. Luce is too quick
to abandon the state for in a society
such as ours the state is not a luxury

Hl 1S & Necessity.

Monday night again in the Chapel
Dr. K. Ross Toole had “Some Com
ments on Student Revolutionaries”.
In a low key address Dr. Yoole
brought out some important and
overlooked problems about student
activism in politics, Dr. Toole told
his audience that America has in the
past overcome her problems and we
will, he hopes, do so again. He be-
moaned the fact that there is a min
ority of students who have given up
on the American system and that
they hyperbolize to point or, to use
his word, they are “myopic”, He
made the point that the McCarthy
campaign showed thal students cin
exert political power but tha: for
some reason it failed in the end. He
claimed that when the revolutionary
says that we have no power he either
lies or is ignoram. One need only
trunspose the power of Woodstock

IN JOINT

On Class of ’73

This report on the activities of
ithe Sophomore Class thus far this
year is being made in hopes of in-
forming and arousing interest in
‘the Sophomore Class by its mem-
bers. On November 17th, a Sopho-
more Class meeting was called to:
(1) find out the general attitude of
ithe Sophomore Class (2) to report on
the budget of the class and (3) to
announce that applications were be-
ing accepted for a Sophomore com-
mittee which would decide how the
surplus money would be used and
which weu!ld hopefully draw the
class closer, together.

Having left the freshman dorms,
students live in a widespread area
and many have contact with the
people they knew as Freshmen. We
find it increasingly difficult to get a
true picture of the class’ needs and
desires. It is our hope that through
this committee we can regain the
sense of unity our class had as fresh-
men,

At the class meeting we had a

ll tunn-out. A total of 18 pe»
ple came. Some people later remark-
ed that they didn't see the posters,
but for the most part, the small at-
tendance was due to the age-old
problem of apathy. Last year our
Freshman class displayed more unity
than most classes ever do; but it ap-
pears that this year, having lost the
day to day associations we had in
the dorms, that our class is gradually
developing the W&L tradition of
apathy.

The following was discussed at the
Sophomore class meeting: (1) The
Budget: $2300 was collected in class
dues and was spent in the following
manner:

$1321.00 for grain

$ 300.00 for the band

$ 40.44 for cups

$ 76.80 for mix

$ 27.09 trash cans and servers
$ 26.00 for ice

$ 12.50 for posters

$ 12.50 for a garden hose

for a total of $1,816.33.

Left in the class treasury is ap-
proximately $500 and (2) How to
use the surplus money? We have
thought of four possibilities: (a) We
can pool our money with the Junior
class and turn the Springs Weekend
cocktail party into a semi-rock festi-
val with four or five good bands and
a bar, (b) hold a sophomore class
party with a good band and set-ups

Contact Studies High

BY SKIP PAUKERT

A nationally prominent history
professor, an advocate of the New
Right, and a lawyer from the New
Left were featured in the opening
programs of “Contact '71” this week.
All three gentlemen addressed them-
selves to topics related to this year’s
theme, “the Crisis in Education.”

“Contact,” an annual symposium
on contemporary issues and prob-
lems, offered its initial presentation
Monday with Dr. K. Ross Toole.
The “Contact” speeches will con-
tinue through next week.

Dr. Toole, a professor of history
at the University of Montana, re-
ceived national attention with the
publication of his article, “The Ty-
ranny of Spoiled Brats,” in several
national periodicals,

Dr. Toole demonstrated himself
to be much of a political liberal in
his views on current issues. He ad-
dressed his speech “to those of you
who may be thinking about giving
up on the system.” He emphasized
that the American political scheme
was imperfect and that reforms were
badly needed, both in foreign and
domestic policy, but he urged that
change must come peacefully and

that recourse to violence was
real alternative.”

Toole pointed to the gathering at
Woodstock as an example of the

latent solidarity and power of youth

“no today. “You must learn the poi'tical

process, and you must learn how to
utilize power,” he said.

Toole criticized student activists
today for being, above all, “myopic.”

Watt Appointed College Dean;
Pusey Steps Down To Teach

The President of the University
announced Monday that Dr. Wil-
liam J. Watt will accept the duties of
Dean of the College, effective next
July 1. He succeeds Dean William
Webb Pusey III, who is returning to
full-time teaching after 11 years of
service as head of the university's
arts and sciences division.

It was revealed that Dean Pusey
had indicated his desire to return to
the chassroom to the Board of Trus-
tees last summer, He will resume his
duties as professor and chairman of
the German Department.

Dr. Watt presently serves as as-
sociate dean of the College. There
was no suggestion as to when or
how a successor will be named to
that post.

Dr. Watt has been a member of
the faculty since 1955. He received
a Bachelor of Science Degree from
the University of Minos in 1949, a
master’s degree from Cornell Uni-
versity in 1951, and his Ph. D. from
Cornell in 1956,

Dr. Pusey came to Washington
and Lee in 1939, the year he earned
his Ph.D. degree from Columbia
University. He also holds a B. S. de-
gree from Haverford College and
an M.A, degree from Harvard.

He served as Acting President of
the University from late 1967 unti
President Huntley took office on
February 5, 1968.

In Monday's announcement Presi-
dent Huntley offered his “deep zrati-
tude—and that of all associated

 
 

with Washington and Lee—to Dr.
Pusey for his decade of invaluable
service as dean.” He added that Or.
Pusey’s “patient and thoughtful lea/-
ership has given the university a
quality of true academic strength,
which will be abiding.”

The selection of Dr. Watt to as-
sume duties as dean of the College,
the president said, “commends itself
on every ground—ability, scholar-
ship, experience.”

er Education

He traced the history of the labor
and farm movements in the United
States, and the reforms brought
about by LaFollette’s Progress ves
and the labor unions, “But you must
have patience, courage, and, »bove
all, tenacity,” he continued.

Toole urged that students begin
to exercise their potent power by
using such tools as the boycott. In
answer to a question on national
priorities, he listed (1) the eradica-
tion of poverty, (2) the preservation
of the ecology, and (3) the resiora-
tion of universities as teaching in-
stitutions,

In answer to another question,
Toole advocated the immediate with-
drawal of U.S, forces from Vietnam,
saying “I haven't met a hawk in

three years.”

Tuesday brought the pairing of
two very unique speakers having a
mutually extensive background in
radical movements. Philip Abbott
Luce, a former Communist and rev-
olutionary, broke with the Left in
1965 and turned to the right wing,
culminating in his work with the
Young Americans for Freedom as
head of their college division.

Leonard Weinglass, an attorney
for many of the nations most promi-
nent leftists, was co-counse! for the
defense with William Kunstler at the
“Chicago 8” trial.

Mr. Luce began his day on camp-
us with a seminar in the afternoon
in the Student Center library, where
he recounted his political evolution
from editor of the national organ of
the communist Progressive Labor
Party to an advocate of rightist lib-
ertarianism.

Luce oniticized the coercive nature
of the state in many elements of
American life, especially education.
In his speech in Lee Chapel Tues-
day evening, he prefaced his re-
marks by saying, “the whcle of the
public educational system is deca-
dem, and we are in need of revoiu-
tionary ideas.”

“I oppose state education because
of its very nature,” he said. Not only

did he think that governmental von-
trol kept down the potential quality
of education, but also “it ‘s implicit
in that educational process that there
is an attempt to indoctrinate stu-
dents in an allegiance to the
state...”

He emphasized the importance of
the years in a child's life from ages
1-5, which are wasted under the
status quo. He also characterized
the 12 years of public primary and
secondary education as “to a large
degree, simply a device to keep you

In Shakespeare's “Hamlet” there
are two minor characters which have
little to do with the action of the
Bard’s most famous tragedy. Rosen-
crantz and Guildenstern are two
gentlemen who are appointed by the
King of Denmark to discover the
cause of Hamlet's madness.

They are dead by the conclusion
of the play.

Tom Stoppard’s “Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead” focuses on
the fate of this hapless pair. It is a
comedy, however, and it will be per-
formed here on February 9 through
13 by the Troubadour Theatre.

“Auditions were, thankfully, in
December,” said Mrs. Bilen Barnes,
director for the production. Speak
ing of the rehearsals, Mrs. Barnes
noted that “we're not there yet, but
we're on our way.”

The cast has been in rehearsal for
the production since before the
Christmas holidays. Which is as it
should be, for the Troubadour
Theatre plans to take the show on a
tour to other colleges in Virginia be-
fore it comes home to W&L for 4
five night run. Performances of “Ro-
sencrantz and Guildenstern” will be
given at Mary Baldwin, Randolph
Macon, Roanoke College, Radford,
and the University of Richmond
during its run on tour February 2
through the 6th.

_Stoppard’s play weaves the scripi
of “Hamlet” throughout the course
of his comedy. Yet the action of the
play centers primarily on the comic
and sometimes pathetic befuddle-
mem of Rosencrantz and Guilden
stern as they attempt to unravel the
mystery of their situation in the in-
trigue of the court of Denmark.

“I suppose I would be lying to
anyone if I told them | totally Un-
derstood the play,” said Mrs, Barnes
“I think it’s a brilliant piece, but |
don't think anyone would be telling

REVIEW and OUTLOOK What Has Gone Before, Is Yet To Come...

Five Speakers Remaining To Fill Toole, Luce, Weinglass Launch
Program, ‘Crisis In Education’ Symposium With Lecture, Debate

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Wednesday, January 13, 1971

Our Mini-‘Crisis In Education’

Interesting isn’t it, that with the beginning of “Contact thy”
we have had the appearance of a group which sat in the Co-op
this week asking for signatures to end R.O.T.C. credit at the
University. It would seem that the members of this group were
attempting to create its own mini-“Crisis in Education” in
order to make “Contact '71” more “relevant.”

Apart from the fact that they're belatedly attempting to get
into the act along with the distinguished speakers W&L is
fortunate enough to have here during this week, this group of
students seems to have a murky conception of the word “edu-
cation,” hence the mini-crisis.

The demand for the elimination of academic credit for
R.O.T.C. is as absurd as the demand that a study of the Re-
naissance be put to a vote of the gtudent body to test its “rele-
vancy.” The points is, education is not democratic or even a
matter of casting a vote for or against one course. If it were,
there would be several students we know who'd vote against
courses throughout the school because of the grade they re-
ceived last term or because they thought the professors too
liberal, too dull, or too conservative.

We doubt that many of the people in this group are enrolled
in R.O.T.C. We doubt that they would appreciate it if people
fro mother persuasions started a petition to eliminate philoso-
phy or english or politics or drama credit. “Relevance” cannot
be defined by one’s own personal perspective. If it were, then
there would be no courses at W&&L offered for credit. The
armed forces (fortunately or unfortunately) are as much of the
reality of everyone's common experience here and elsewhere as
is the question of the economic future of the United States. The
problem students have to cope with is not whether R.O.T.C.
should be offered for credit, but whether or not they should
take R.O.T.C. for credit.

(It amuses us that no moral arguments would likely be
raised at all if there weren't a war going on somewhere which
threatened the immediate future of students on this campus.
The moral arguments take the stand that R.O.T.C. is not aca-
demic, but the real motivation behind this argument is anti-
war beliefs of this group of students.)

The real crisis in the educational system today is the misuse
of the word “education.” We hope that tempests in teapots
such as the thinly disguised political line “end R.O.T.C. credit”
will not affect the bright future education has here.

The Craze: Retrospective

It tends to be that our arithmetic was slightly in error last

week.

200 Honor Roll students

+400 Dean's List students

=Not 600 but 400 Honor Roll and Dean's List students.

So our casual estimate of one-half of the student body mak-
ing Dean's List and Honor Roll is reduced to 36 percent. Even
with this reduced percentage, the significance of this marked
rise in figures is not diminished. We reiterate our proposal that
requirements for Dean's List should be changed from 3.0 to
3.2 and those for Honor Roll from 3.5 to 3.6.

Especially in view of the fact that the Class of 1971 was one
of the contributing factors in the rise of the percentage for this
term. 162 out of the 262 members of the class made a GPR of
3.0 or above, with 73 seniors on the Honor Roll. One wonders
whether the overall intelligence of the senior class has mel-
lowed with age here at W&L. Whether it has or not is a moot
point. However, we think the more stringent requirements for
recognition of academic distinction are necessary and valid,

Dropping Drop-Add Bureaucracy

In the past four years, this paper has seen an incredible
amount of change. Some of it has been good, some bad, but at
least the driving motive has been one of improvement. One
can look back and be proud of the fact that we have changed.

But in all our change something seems to have been left
untouched. It recurs twice annually, but the aggravation ts
short-lived and goes before one has time to really notice it,
generally speaking. However, we have had trouble with it, and
it has remained in our minds,

It is not uncommon to spend two days changing one’s
schedule. One must first track down at least four signatures
whose authors always seem to be away, After walking from
the two course professors, the student must go to the Dean
and waste his time making sure that everything is all right
To add insult to injury, the course changes cost $5

In a school that prides itself on a personal touch, and in a
.chool where data processing is used quite efficiently in an ad
ministrative capacity, it seems absurd that the archaic system
of course changes is allowed to exist as it does

The funny thing is that the needed change ts really quite
simple, All the student should have to do is go to his advisor
and ask for the change. If the Deans feel it is necessary to make
sure everything is functioning properly, they should have a list
of changes sent to them

I'm sure that less than five per cent of the course changes
are in error in some way (besides actual mistakes on the Drop
\dd slips). This school must take in a couple of thousand dol
lars on course changes, Well, maybe taht’s permissible, but the
fee should not be used as a deterrent

Washington and Lee’s CONTACT
‘71 symposium, focusing on the gen-
eral theme, “The Crisis in Educa-
tion,” will continue with a broad
cross-section of speakers.

Friday night Dr. Charles Hamil-
ton of Columbia University will
speak in Lee Chapel. Dr. Hamilton
will discuss “Ohanging and Ex-
panding Curricula for Blacks and
Whites.”

Hamilton, professor of Urban
Studies at Columbia, was co-author
with Stokeley Carmichel of Black
Power: Politics of Liberation in
America. A discussion period will
follow the address.

On Monday, U.S. Senator Mark
O. Hatfield, (R.-Ore) will offer an
address in Evans Dining Hall. Hat-
field, prominent member of the Sen
ate and co-sponsor of a controver-
sial Cambodian legislation is for-
imerly an associate professor and
dean of students at Williamette Uni-
versity in Salem, Oregon.

Hatfield, whose recent bout with
flu necessitated a change in the ori-
ginal CONTACT ‘71 schedule, will
be the guest of honor at a cocktail
party at the Psi Upsilon House start-
ing at 7 p.m. His speech will be fol-
lowed by a question and answer
period.

The Senator is expected to speak
en “Reordering Our Priorities: In-
creased Aid to Higher Education.”

On Tuesday, Dr. David Donald,
the Harry G. Black Professor of His-
tory at The Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, and a Pulizter Prize winner,
will deliver the Lee’s Birthday,
Founer's Day Convocation at noon
in Evans Hall.

CONTACT resumes on Wednes-
day, January 20 with the appear-
ance of Dr. Arthur Hansen, presi-
dent of the Georgia Institute of
Technology. Hansen, described by
CONTACT chairman Madison Cole
as a “dynamic speaker” will address
himself to the topic, “Technology,
Our Terror or Our Triumph,”

The symposium will conclude on
Friday, January 22, with the joint
appearance of Rep. Philip Crane,
(R.-Il.) and Dr. Harald Taylor.

Crane, a prominent conservative,
was elected to the Senate in 196).
Taylor was formerly president of
Sarah Lawrence College, and he was
noted for innovations, among them
the “Free University” concept. He
is the author of Students Without
Teachers: The Crisis in the Univer-
sity.

Both men will conduct afternoot
seminars, Crane in Reid Hall, and
Taylor in the University Center Li-
brary.

Dr. Taylor will be honored at ¢
cocktail party at the Phi Kappa Sig-
ma house at 7 p.m.

Contact chairman Matt Cole urges
all students to make the fullest use
of the opportunities presented by
this year’s symposium possible. The
fact that the student body finances
this annual event through direct dues

and IFC co-sponsorship means that
the speakers visit the campus for
the benefit of all students.

The support of the student body
will mean that in the future we can
enjoy programs such as this, and
can continue to attract key people in
the country to the symposium.

However, to provide speakers such
as Dr. Hamilton, Sen. Hatfield, Dr.

Dr. Taylor, Mr. Luce, Mr. Wein-

in the past, such as Sen. Goldwater,

In the past two evenings “Con-
tact” has provided us with two very
different forms of discussion, one in-
telligent and enlightening the other
bland and embarrassing. Surprising-
ly enough they came from the
sources we least expected.

Last night in Lee Chapel Philip
Luce and Leonard Weinglass en-
gaged in something less than a de-
‘bate. I fully expected a knock-down-
drag-out affair but was pleasantly
surprised with the civility and per-
ception of the participants. Anyone
who was there will attest to the fact
that there seemed to be little dis-

“Who knows what evil lurks in

old crystal radio set, were enough to
send audiences of the late °30's, the
‘40's, and the early ‘50's into fit. of

Feb. 23——-NEVER GIVE A SUCK-
ER AN EVEN BREAK—W. (
Fields, Glorma Jean, Lion Errol

“Anyone who hates dogs and chil
tren can't be all bad.”

The W&L Film Committee will
hold an informal discussion to select
films for the remainder of the year
on Thursday, at 7 p.m. All interesied
people are urged to come to the
Cockpit,

teresting to note that in many ways
we saw a result of two peopie who
are described as “left” and “right”
coming into agreement because they
have come full circle on the political
spectrum, which is, in my way., re-
assuring. Restricting themselves, for
the most part, to the field of educa-
tion, they made some very important
points. Luce in his opening renvaerks
made the point that public education
in America has failed and thar it
exists primarily for the benefit and
continuance of the state. It feil upon
Weinglass to defend the state and
the necessity for the state to be re-
sponsive. This struck me as strange
coming from a member of the “New
Left.” It seems to me that if any-
thing revolutionary groups, whom
Mr. Weinglass counts as his clients,
are Opposed to the monolith that is
the government. But the basic point
remains that Mr. Weinglass and Mr.
Luce are both opposed to the form
the government has taken today and
especially in its relation to educa-
tion.

I would have to draw as ther
point of disagreement their attitudes

bout what the new posture of edu
cation and of government should be.
Mr. Luce made it quite chear that he
feels that an attitude of laissezfaire
towards education is necessary. He
felt that the parents should take up
the total responsibility for their chil-
dren’s education. Mr. Weinglass
countered with the salient point that
thi swould be difficult if not impos-
sible to accomplish in the Black
community or in Poverty areas,
Weinglass felt that the state is noi
teaching what is relevant or impor-
tant. He felt that in our “post-in-
dustrial” world we must be open to
anything and everything for our edu-
gation to be effective. He also
brought up the point of community
in relation to the campus environ-
ment. He said that four years in co!
lege isolate us from our communit:
and leave us in a limbo that we
never really get out of. This i:ola-
tion resulis in the creation of an
elite and an elite that is not in com-
munication with the other segments
of the society.

What one came out with here is
that education is primarily a tool
of the state so the siate can continue.
It is obvious that they both are dis-
enchanted with their education and
the one we are receiving. Luce’s
thesis that we should adopt a laisse ’-
faire policy is to me misguided and
can only end in greater disassocia
tion between individuals and be-
tween individuals and the society
itself. Weinglass was far more hon-
est about the role of the state and
the necessity for the slate to reform
so that it can educate with openness,
and effoct-veness. Luce is too quick
to abandon the state for in a society
such as ours the state is not a luxury

Hl 1S & Necessity.

Monday night again in the Chapel
Dr. K. Ross Toole had “Some Com
ments on Student Revolutionaries”.
In a low key address Dr. Yoole
brought out some important and
overlooked problems about student
activism in politics, Dr. Toole told
his audience that America has in the
past overcome her problems and we
will, he hopes, do so again. He be-
moaned the fact that there is a min
ority of students who have given up
on the American system and that
they hyperbolize to point or, to use
his word, they are “myopic”, He
made the point that the McCarthy
campaign showed thal students cin
exert political power but tha: for
some reason it failed in the end. He
claimed that when the revolutionary
says that we have no power he either
lies or is ignoram. One need only

Through A Spyglass Darkly ...

’Riting Off The Corps? :

  

(Editor’s Note: We welcome Mack
Woodward, a junior majoring in
history, to The Ring-tum Phi as a
weekly columnist. We invite your
comments on his views, which are,
we note, not necessarily those of
The Ring-tum Phi.)

BY MACK WOODWARD

“End ROTC Credit,” demand the
signs. “Sign the petition inside.”
One wonders exactly why military
science should not be offered for
credit. Is it not as “relevant” as
other courses offered, as “relevant”
as Classics 309? Doubtful. Perhaps
ROTC should be banned from camp-
us as an indication of sentiment
against the war in Vietnam.

Adding and dropping courses to
protest government policy does not
seem logical, however. It especially
does not seem logical in connection
with the idea of “University Com-
munity” that was so au courant last
spring. The idea of University Com-
munity would seem to indicate that
there is—or should be—some sense
of unity among all elements of the
University. Community and unity
imply—to me—a sense of respec!

ments: “, . . wave your freak flag
high,” if you please; don’t stop me

 

  

from wearing a coat and tie if I so
desire. Do what you like as long as
you are not barbarous about it.

Ending credit for military train
ing would be completely devoid of
respect for others’ preferences. End-
ing credit for military training per-
haps would demonstrate a lack of
support of the war in Southeast Asia;
there are, however, those of us who,
if it weren’t for military service,
would be shipped out soon after
graduation; military science at least
gives those who desire it a chance
to avoid being in the middle of «
rice paddy surrounded by Viet Cong.
Dropping military science from the
list of courses offered for credit jeo-
pardizes the idea of academic free-
dom which many of us cherish.

Nor would ending military sci-
ence credit end the war in Southeasi
Asia—no more than wearing aa
armband or picketing Newcomb

that changed. When Nixon ordered

Outside, Looking In
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

When I first appeared at this Uni-
versity some three and a half years
ago, I came armed with a completely
new wardrobe of coats, ties and
cuffed slacks. These were clearly not
the type of clothes | would wear at
home. I had been used to wearing
white socks and white levis to class
all through my high school days.

But I had been told that W&L was
a coat and tie school and that my
styles would clearly be out of place.
Being a meek and quiet freshmen I
conformed so as not to rock the
boat.

As time passed, I even began to
like wearing a jacket and tie to class.
Nobody ever took me to task for it
and cuffed slacks had long since
ceased to bother me. I was aware
that some students had fallen off a
bit from the patterns of conventional
dress, but I continued on detiber-
ately, secure in the knowledge that
| was conforming to the accepted
standard

Surely you can imagine the great
blow to my sensibilities when one
day in my senior year I discovered
in an editorial that not only were
some students not wearing coats and
ties, but that they had even ceased
to be considered desirable by the
EC. For the supreme establishnwn-

to wear a jacket and tie to class if I
will offend anyone by my non-con-
formity. But I'm too set in my ways
to change.

Therefore, I beg of the EC to con-
sider giving me a special dispensa-
tion to continue wearing a coat and
tie on campus, I am still much too
timid to be a non-conformist, and
such a dispensation would be a great
relief.

Hopefully,

Roy D. Carlton, ‘7i
P.S.—Another untraditional idea bas
been gradually creeping into my
mind which may find asylum among
some of the more unconventional
people on this campus. It is the mat-
ted of the University’s name. Why
honor those two? Many people have
given us more money thar St.
George. And the traditions of St.
Bob are all but gone. So why con-
tinue with the farce? I think a far
more descriptive name for our in-
stitution would be the Univeisity of
Lexington.

“Rising Sap” Is Negative
To the Editor of The Ring-um Phi:

| have debated for several days
whether or not to pen the thoughts
which have been running through
my mind partially in response to
R. Baroody’s comment on “Love
Story” and in part independently of
that stimulus.

on “Love Story” because it oozed
with the poutyaced negativism o°
insatiable protestors. | do not con-
demn protest. Quite the contrary |
actively support it and through posi-
tive action try to bring about reform

ence. | am aware of vast apparently
unconquerable problems in America
and the work at large. | don't be-
little Mr. Baroody's concern with the
serious problems facing our world

However, | strongly object to his
condemnation of “Love Story.” |

aware that it is an enchanted escape

they were not helping before “Love
Story” appeared. No damage is done
on that count.

“Love Story” was a beautiful
book. It was pleasant with happiness
and realistic with grief. In short, I
feel it dealt honestly with human
emotions other than indignance, dis-
illusion, protest and negativism.
This is healthy.

It seems that our society, especi-
ally the younger segment, has wal-

On “Love Story” Attack
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

I was disgusted when I read Rob-
ert Baroody’s article, “On Rising
Sap,” a criticism of Erich Segal’s
“Love Story.” I feel that Baroody is
misled in his ideas and that his criti-
cism is overly harsh.

Baroody is unnecessarly bombas-

tic in his article. My first impression
was that author Baroody seemed to
be a high school student trying dili-
gemly to impress his teacher with
some big words and apparently
“heavy” thoughts on such a simple
subject as “Love Story.” In fact, I
even had to look up the word “pue-
rile” which Baroody used in his
paper.
Of course, that may be expected
of a boy from the South Louisiana
swamps, but I still find it unneces-
sary to us such a “thick” vocabulary
for this sort of topic. “Diarrhea” was
uncalled for also. Why doesn’t Ba-
roody just come out and say that he
just did not appreciate “Love Story?”
It would have been more appropriate
and probably more effective.

Baroody says that “Segal’s story-
telling style is almost admirable in
its modern simplicity; and that the
film .. . is technically proficient,
but not elaborate.” Unfortunately,
Baroody has missed the main obje:-
tive of Segal in “Love Story” to be
simple and unelaborate. It was
meamt to be just that—a love story,

which was passed by the largest vote
turn-out in a long time. Those of us
who were here then remember the
Free University, U. Va., Jerry Ru-
bin, and William Kunstler. Many a
student at W&L, whether liberal or
not, was understandably enraged
over the Cambodian action.

The strike’s subsequent verbiage
lead into many other important areas
of the American political scene.
Topics like Bobby Seale, the Black
Panthers, the environmental destruc-
tion, and the value of our own edu-
cation were on the minds and ton-
gues of many of us. It was a unique
happening here at W&L as it was
reflecting on what happened last
May.

Not too long after the May crisis
I heard someone commenting on
what happened here at W&L. The
gist of what this person said was:
where was all of that student ferver
and energy when the blacks and the
poor of the area around them nee:-
ed it?” For years W&L has been en
island of wealth in a sea of poverty.
Where has that concern of last May
gone?

How many of us really went home
to work for peace or equality?
Since arriving back at school what,
if anything, has been done to im-
prove relations and engender under-
standing between the school and the
local townspeople. The spending of
large sums of money does not really
bring about a meeting of the minds.
What agency, if any, left over from
the strike is doing anything to help
the people who hive in the surround-
ing area climb out of their heli of
poverty?

Let's face facts, now thai the
threat to us has been minimized or
negated we have gone back to the
good old days, before the strike.
When the only things we were con-
cerned about were ourselves. The
national strike committee, says a
rumor, is ready to declare a new

Football Fades to Memory

It’s sort of a transitional period
right now. Football is just about
over; only the Super Bowl, and its
lady-in waiting, the Pro Bowl, re-
mains. All this and that teams ap-
pear, sprinkled throughout the sports
sections like rice flung at a wedding.

On the college campuses through-
out the nation, the attention of stu-
dents and alumni is now focused for
the most part on the basketball court
instead of the football field, as two
groups of quints battle to put a
brown ball into the orange hoop.
And upstairs, its all for money.

Televisions are strangely quiet,
as the noisy blare of “fourth and
inches for the Wolverines,” fades
oul, returning only as a memory. A
sooty covering of ice and snow ‘s
the only spectator seated in most of
the stadia of the nation. Those cheap
hot dogs that always managed to
taste like a seven course meal from
the Four Seasons are out of reach at
least until next season. And that
guy with the pennant, the one who
always rooted for the other team,
who always used to give you prob-
lems if you dropped mustard on his
collar, is suddenly a lost friend.

 

Then there was scalping. Oh, you
can always, (well, almost always,)
scalp tickets to the games, but there
was never the thrill of a sale unless
the multitudes were pouring into the
stadium. Remember how happy you
were when the guy with the suspici-
ous looks, the one who had frown-
ed disapprovingly when you sold
your six dollar ticket for seven dol-
lars, just shook his head and walked
off?

But the measure of worth as a
salesman came not as a scallper, but
rather, when you could sell a thirty-
yard line seat for the full face value,
even if the game was far from a
sell-out.

Once inside if you were lucky,
someone nearby might even be
knowledgeable enough to explain
the strategy, the whys and what fors
that make football so interesting.
Someone, perhaps your Dad. There
was always excitment, be it that
long, arching throw which made you
wait breathlessly in anticipation of
its fate, or the sudden realization
that your man had just side-stepped
two defenders and was striding fr
the end zone.

Or maybe it was the desperate
prayer for those guys to become ele-
ven demons to stop the enemy with
a brilliant goal-line stand.

And afterwards, those broken-
down sportswriters using the same
cliches to describe the game. That
was football season and I realiy miss
it.

RING-TUM PHI

B-Ballers Consolation
Winners In Florida

BY PALMER TRIC!

With the completion of their Fior-
ida campaign, our Generals return-
ed Sunday to the snows of the frigid
North. Their venture into che land
of milk and honey proved only par-
tially successful. The record tor the
Classic was only 1-1, but to use the
old phrase, they knew that we had
been there. In the opening bout, our
boys took on the undefeated corps
of King College. The Generals, who
started off well enough to earn an
11 point lead at the half, were nipp
ed by a score of 54-48. King went
into the game 10-0, a heavy favorite.
They came away respecting the WAL
defense, which is either 14th or 15th
in the nation, among small colleges.

The Generals shot a poor 31% from
the floor, and took 16 less foul shots
than did King. Problems for the
squad were lack of movement, both
with and without the ball, and la:k
of poise. Attempts to get the ball in-
side against the bigger opponents
failed. Despite a super defensive
performance, a lack of offensive
punch brought the General downfall
in the opening round.

rhe second contest found the Gen-
erals in their famed match-up de-
fense. In addition to this, they em-
ployed a full court zone press. This
proved to ‘be the key to the General
victory over M.LT. Doug Clelan
put in a super performance, notch-

Bryce Mountain--Ski Resort?

 

:
This past Saturday was spent at
Virginia’s only accredited Nostar
skiing area, Bryce Mountain. That is
to say, it’s the best slope in Virginia
(of course, it doesn’t get much com-
petition from The Homestead).

But I was a bit disheartened to be
told I had arrived at Bryce Moun-
tain without realizing wt. Though
small, however, there was some clial-
lenge ahead.

Dhe first was that of ski rental. If
by any chance you can beg, borrow,
or steal your equipment, please, for
your sake, do so. You can spend up
to an hour in that one little room.
Your best bet is to run by Pres
Brown's and see what they can do
for you, The total package is an

  

very long, so that you spend 80 per
cent of your time in line, 10 per cent
on the slopes, and the remaiing 19
per cent inside drinking ‘beer.

But it was a lot of fun. There were
a lot of W&L people there, along
with an assortment of Hollins, Bald-
win, and U.Va. students. And, with
all its drawbacks, Bryce offered
pretty decent skiing. The snow,
though icy in spots, was quite ski-
able, and the advanced slope, though
not too difficult, was at least an on-
joyable run. There are two other
runs. One is a long beginner’s run,
and the other has a relatively steep
face and is much shorter.

It’s a great place for beginners. It
seems they are there in abundance
on the weekend, And everyone seems

 

astoundingly high $7.50 at Bryce. At
that rate, one could afford tu be
fully (and nicely) equipped after
some 15 outings.

Lift tickets are $6 for students on
weekends. This gives you access to
two chairs and a rope tow. This
doesn't help too much, however, be-
cause the lines after 10 asm. are 45
minutes long, and the runs aren't

to have a good time just being there.
The serious skier must realize that
he’s at Bryce and go from there.
But the best bet is to go up during
the week. There will be smaller
crowds and more skiing, but maybe
that’s not the purpose of Bryce. It’s
not Vail, you know.

Good night, McTurks; see you
next year,

Swimming Team

Falls To Duke
By 59-54

The Washington and Lee Gen-
erals’ swim team, under the leader-
ship of Coach Bill Stearns, travelled
to Duke University on Friday, Janu-
ary 8 for a dual meet. The result: a
59-54 setback for the watermen.

An easy victory was within reach,
but as Coach Stearns pointed out,
the lack of depth in the two diving
events forfeited valuable points. As
usual, the eight man varsity squad
displayed superb individual effort.

All-American Bill Brumback, the
team’s senior captain, was a Jouble
individual winner in the 50 yard
freestyle with a personal season best
of 22.4, and in the 100 yard free-
style, with an anchor on the winn‘ng
400 yard freestyle relay.

Brumback’s two efforts have gain-
ed him qualifying berths in the na-
tional championships coming on
March 19-20-21 in Springfield, Mass
achusetts. Also landing himself in
the nationals is freshman Steve Eric-
son, posting a blistering 58.4 in the
100 yard backstroke for first place.

Sophomore Alan Corwith won the
200 yard freestyle and was a mem-
ber of the winning 400 yard free-
style relay. John Lawlor, a junior,
snatched the blue ribbon in the in-
dividual medley and Bim Ciark’s
performance almost assures him a
nationals’ berth within the next cou-
ple of meets.

This Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m.
the Doremus gym pool, the swim-
mers host always tough Virginia.
Coach Stearns expects another close
battle and says that the diving events
could prove to be the diiference.
The team has been practicing an
average of 10,000 yards a week since
December 28 and the devotion inns
far has pleased Coach Stearns to
the point that he expects to curry on
the tradition of successive winning
seasons.

BILL BRUMBACK

Wrestlers Pinned By UNC

The Washington and Lee wrestling
team has had several disappoint-
ments since their initial victory over
Guilford. Shut out by the Cavaliers
from the University of Virginia and
beaten by both Duke and Dickinson,
the Generals went against the Uni-
versity of North Carolina last Sat-
urday, January 9, at Chapel Hill.

Unfortunately, this year’s match
with U.N.C., like last year’s, was a
heartbreaker, with the Generals los-
ing closely by a score of 22-20. Tir-
ed by a long night trip to Chapel
Hill and weakened by a virus that
had hit the team, the Generals were
at a disadvantage before the match
even began.

The General's best match of the
meet was the first one, at 118
pounds, with Pat Buford pinning his
opponent in a matter of seconds.
Nexit, at 126 pounds, Bruce Hyait
won by a forfeit, as did his succes-
sor, Craig Hankins, at 134. At 142
pounds, Bill West, weakened by
sickness, lost by a decision. Bill Me!-
ton, a freshman, did a good, solid
job at 150, pinning his U.N.C. op-
ponent. The Generals lost the match

For Those Interested Skiers...

Another Word About
Student Ski Cards

There have been an_ incredibic
amount of inquiries about possible
ski discounts for W&L students.
The advantage cannot be found here
in Virginia but only in ‘the North
and West. In those places one may
obtain a dollar discount on lift tic-
ket’s and up to twenty per cent off
on equipment. The cards are avail-
able to faculty and student's wives.

A magazine is sent out once a
month, and it is concerned mostly
with skiing on a small budget.

The card sells for $4.00 and can

at 158 pounds, with Jim Stieff los-
ing by a decision, Though the Gen-
erals were planning to forfeit the
167 slot, they changed their minds
and put in their assistant coach,
Bruce Hankins. Wrestling in a class
12 pounds above him, Bruce was
pinned. Bard Wrisley and Dee Cop-
enhaver, also struck with sickness,
‘both lost by a decision. Att this point,
the Generals were winning 20-17,
but, in the next match, U.N.C. was
able to snatch away the victory by
pinning Jay Fulcher at heavyweight

The meet was a close one, and
had the W&L team not been plagued
by sickness, it could have easily
been victorious. In fact, one player
ssoribed the team as a “walking
infinmary,” losing to disease rather
than U.N.C. But despite this handi-
cap, the Generals still made two
pins.

An essential element of the Wash-
ington and Lee wrestling team has
been the freshmen, who make up
over a third of the varsity roster.
Outstanding freshmen include Bill
Melton, who pinned his opponent
in the U.N.C. meet, Bruce Hyatt,
and Jim Stieff. Jim had his best
match so far against the Universiiy
of Virginia, where, though he los
by a decision, he wrestled a fine
match,

Another essential element of the
team, Which cannot go unnoticed, ‘s
the coaching, which law student
Larry Cohen has taken on. He’s
done a fine job.

On Tuesday, January 19th, Wash-
ington and Lee visits the Virginia
Military Institute to take on the
Cadets, who should offer stiff com-
petition, After that, the Generals
wrestle Eastern Mennonite here.
Coach Cohen, for the past few
weeks, has been carrying around a
vietory cigar to be lit when the Gen-
erals win their second victory. Per-
haps he will be able to take it out of
his pocket and light it soon.

ing 8 big points in the final three
minutes of the game. This contest
found the Generals shooting a meas
ly 36%. The success of the press was
reflected in the turnover statistics—
the Boys in Blue turned the ball over
only 10 times, while M.LT. lost pos-
session 21 times. Captain Mike Dan
iel had a good effort, good enough
for all-tournament choice. The Gen-
erals were out rebounded in both
contests.

Wednesday, Coach Canfield’s
Corps travels to Annapolis, to face
the Naval Academy. Air time is set
for 4 o'clock on WLUR-FM. This
weekend the team will be at home
for two big ball games. The oppon-
ents will be Bryant and St. Paul's.
St. Paul is a quick run and shoot
team. Bryant is also an exciting
squad. They have been one of the

? ~ *

best small college teams in the couti-
try for the last three years. Coach
Canfield has labeled the next two
weeks as the most crucial of the sea-
son. The Generals will be ready.
Support them. Everyone can be an
athletic supporter.

Toole, Luce, Weinglass Launch
Symposium With Lecture, Debate

(Continued from Page 2)

to a political end, he pointed out, for
this generation to really exert its
power. Power, and its intelligent use
was really the key to his talk. He
mentioned Nader as a good example
of the ues of statutory powers. In-
deed he feels that this generation hs
to learn how to use power and that
takes time. He emphasized the neces-
sity for “tenacity and courage” and
his blueprint for the proper etuce
tion of a viable and powerful gen-
eration of reformers was to “I, boxe
a look at America’s past, 2. lhat
this country cannot start over, 2,
That a revolution eats its own chil-
dren, and 4, Not to be naive” for we
are fighting great power. He empha-
sized the need for “perservance”
and “resiliency” and that we must
keep pounding at the problems.
While all this is probably true one
cannot overlook two very important
things. First of all Dr. Toole dese ib-
ed student revolutionaries as ‘sick’.
What Dr. Toole failed to realize was
that American society has created
these “sick” revolutionaries. All of
us then must take some responsibil-
ity for these “sick” people. Certainly
the futility of revolutionary ac.
must be evident and therefore it ts
indigent upon the society to provide
viable outlets for these energies. The
futility in the constant struggle for
reform is often hard or impossilie to
overcome. One wonders why Dr.
Toole never addressed himseif to
this very pressing problem. Incecd
when exposed to one student's bad-
gering Dr. Toole sluffed it off there-
by creating a perfect exampic of
why we have “sick” revolutionaries.
Indeed this student's action was a
fine example of an empty and futile
act that meant nothing, but must
have affected that student. This stu
demt must also however be chastized.
His discourtesy was regretable and
he managed to embarrass himself
and the entire audience. It is unfor-
tunate that he felt this way. I must
also say that as I entered I heard
this very student say that he was go-
ing to leave his hat on as a sign cf
disrespect; this before he even heard
what Dr. Toole had to say. Even
after Dr. Toole explained his ‘e'‘ter
this student still felt it importaat
enough to make a scene that, in its
finality, was an empty and meaning-
less act. One can only try and under-

stand the reasons for this action if
the student felt he was doing some-
thing important. If he was doing it
for kicks he becomes pathetic.

To change this society it is going
to take a lot of hard work and pati-
nee. Empty act, of which we had a
good example Monday night, will do
little to create change. It will how-
ever create a climate where change
becomes more difficult. Dr. Toole
may well be right about student rev-
olutionaries in that their blueprint
for change may be more damaging
than beneficial, But that does not
mean that we should disregard them.

Tebo Praises Novel

(Continued from page 3)

“Love Story” is something refresh-
ing, something apart from the usual
in our lives today, something nice
for a change.

I see Baroody as a heartless mion-
ster when he claims that “There is
nothing tragic or cosmic in the anti-
septic death of Jenny.” Jenny is
only a character of fiction, but can
there not be love and feeling for an
idea? I also feel that the term “cos-
mic” is not at all applicable in this
situation.

Baroody speaks of “Love Story”
asa “dead end tearjerker” and as a
“mindless little diversion.” I fully
disagree with this statement. Segal’s
aim was to entertain us—to create
something we could enjoy—scume-
thing meaningful. As complex ss ‘he
world is today, people need some
simple diversions.

As ugly as life often is now we
need something beautiful. As culd
and heartless as people are today,
what we need is love. “Love Story”
is something peaceful, something
lovely, something bloodless for a
change. 1 agree—the thoughts and
ideas expressed by Segal in “Love
Story” are not revolutionary, deep
or “cosmic.” But I believe they were

OINT

On Constitution

BY GLENN AZUMA

Co-Chairman, Committee for
Constitutional Change

In viewing the past few years al
Washington and Lee it is impossible
‘to ignore the change in the composi-
ition of the student body, Not only ‘s
there a greater diversity in social
and economic backgrounds, but
there has been an attendant diversi
fication of opinion and outlook, This
change provided the primary impe'-
us for the constitutional amend-
ations proposed by the Committee
for Constitutional Change.

It is our belief that the structure
of student government as represent-
ed in the present Executive Commit-
tee cannot be responsive or repre-
sentative in light of the increased di-
versity of the student body. Hope-
fully, the changes which we have
proposed will provide a greater de-
gree of responsive representation
and a sensitivity to the sentiments of
the student body. At the same time it
is hoped that these changes will cn
courage greater leadership and =x-
panded participation in student gov-
ernmem,

If these objectives are attained
the structure of student government
will be more relevant to the major-
ity of the students and the inoreas-
ingly popular and possibly valid be-
lief that student government is mere-
ly an instance of comic farce may be
laid to rest. There is an attendant
though less apparent consideration
and that is our hope that the action
of our proposals may stimulate a
wider assessment of the relation of
student government to the univer-
sity as a Whole.

The most significant alteration in
the character of student government
follows from the separation of the
judicial functions and responsiiv ities
from the legislative. We propo: the
creation of a separate Honor Court
and a Student Senate.

The Honor Court will have 12
mrenrbers. One justice will be erected
from each undergraduate class and
the law school. In addition, 4 jus-
tices will be chosen from the mem-
bership of the Senate by an eloction
of that body. The Student Body of-
ficers (Presidem, V. P. & Secreimry)
will be ex officio voting members
of the Court. In all matters pertain-
ing to the Honor Sysiem the court
will have sole jurisdiction.

The Student Senate will
32 voting members including the
V.P. and the Secretary with the
President of the Student Body as the
presiding officer. Six representuives
will be elected from each class and
the law school, All Student commit-
tees will be placed under the author-
ity of the senate and will be ‘argely
composed of the membership of
that body. However, appo’ ronents
from the student body at large can
be made to the committees if such
action is considered necessary by the
Senate. The chairmanships of these
committees will be dete: .rined by
the approval of the Senate upon ap-
plications from any inicrested stu-
dent.

There are two possible problems
which should be considered. Ihe
most significant one pertainin: to
the availability of qualified and en
thusiastic individuals which are nec
essary for the effective operation of
this expanded swudent government
it has been suggesicd that the in
creased base of student government
proposed will merely result in the
fragmentation of responsibility. This
fragmentation would result inn
creased apathy and evenually couse
the collapse of the entire stru.iure
This, certainly, is a powib'iiy and
its destructive consequences cannot
be ignored

Equal considerwtion should be
viven in regard to the effect of the
separation of powers upon the integ
rity of the Honor System. Kt ha»
boon asserted that the disussoccation

consim cl

of the Honor Court from all legisla
tive maetiess may only further
sirengthen the moorrest asooation

of the Honor System with an “in
quisitional court,” Any change whieh
furthers this association would, in
my opinion, be destructive to a vital
part of the university
These are two of the
portant objections which have been
made to our regarding
our proposals, While there are other

Juniors who are less than 23 years
old by next June are invited to com-
pete.

Candidates should demonstrate:
1. Literary and scholastic abilities
and attainments.

2. Qualities of character, truth,
courage, devotion to duty, kindli-
ness, and unselfishness, and fellow-
ship.

3. Instinots to lead and desire io

4. Physicial vigor, as shown by in-
terest in sports or other activities.
5. Pleasing personality.

The Rhodes Committee, Profes-
sors Jenks, Coulling, and Martin,

Poco, Livingston Taylor Will

BY ROY CARLTON

Fancy Dress may have died, but
there won't be a dearth of music al
Washington and Lee this February.
lhree concerts are scheduled for the
coming month, two of them on con-
scoutive evenings. February 5 will
greet Livingston Taylor, brother of
the popular James Taylor, to Dore
mus gym. The following nights’ con-
cert will fewture the Allman Brothers
Band as the tempo switches from
country to progressive blues rock. A
luter February 20 concert will be
given by Pooo, the country-flavored

heir to the music of the Buffaly
Springfield.
The appearance of Livingston

Taylor at WAL should satisfy the
numerous students who have been
clamoring to have James Taylor in
concert. The similarities in the styles,
personulities and music of the broth
ers is unmistakable. Each plays sim
ple folk music tinged with North
Carolina country. There is the same
naive simplicity in their songs, and
deep sincerity in their voices.

Yet, Liv Taylor is more than jus.
a substitute for James. He is an ea
tremely talented, perhaps superior
performer, in his own right. They

vanguard of the civil rights move-
ment and of black intellectual cir-
cles, has co-authored a book with
Stokely Carmichael, “Black Power:
Politics of Liberation in America.”
Raised in the South and educated at
the Tuskeegee Institute and at the
University of Chicago, Hamilton is
now a professor of political science
at Columbia University.

Hamilton, in his formal remarks
in Lee Chapel, urged a “changing
and expanding of curricula” with re-
gard to black studies. He argued that
reservations held by those who ques-
tion the legitimacy of courses in
black culture are unfounded on both
intellectual and moral grounds.

The black spokesman pointed to
a study of various colleges and un:
versities he recently made. He found
nearly all “inadequate” in a relevant
curriculum for bhacks.

He said that courses in American
Negro and African history, culture,
language, music and art should be
included, “though not necessarily in
a separate department.” He main-
tained that such courses “would not
only benefit black students in acquu -
ing a pride of their race, but would
also help whites” in reaching his-
torical perspective and an apprecia-
tion of black culture.

Senator Hatfield, speaking before
a substantial crowd in Evans Dining
Hall, warned that “all education, o

concert is To that; a Livingston
Paylor concert. The basic themes of
their music are different, too. While
the lyrics of James are filled with
the intensity of his love for his dead
girlfriend Suzanne, Liv is more light-
hearted, When his songs do deal with
love, it is an innocent, enjoyable,
lessinvolved love, without the
moreseness and depth of his broth-
ers songs.

Although the Allman Brothers
Band hails from Macon, Georgia,
their musical birthright is San Fran-
cisco psych. The leaders of the six
man group, Duane and Greg All-
man, started as memebrs of the
San Francisco based Hour Glass.
Their supporting members have also
been into music for years as mom-
bers of various soul and blues bonds.

The driving impetus for the
Band's music is provided by Duwne
Allman, one of the finest guiiarists
in all of rock, who has chosen as his
instrument the electric stide guitar,
potentially the most sensational
soundmaker of all. While Johnny
Winter may turn us on to the flashy
brillance of his slide guitar pyro’ech
nics, Duane Allman seems intention.
ally to under-emphasize just those

primary, secondary, and higher
levels, is in deep trouble . . . with

Hatfield blamed both administra
tors and politicians “for failing to re-
examine our own priorities an!
goals, to redefine our mission in edu-
cation to upgrade and improve hu-
man life.”

The Oregon senator emphasized
that dollars alone would not cure
the crisis facing colleges today, but
the cniticized federal aid to higher
education as being oriented too
much in the direction of defense re-
search. “We must realize where this
government funding is being ex-
pended,” he said. “Starting in 1958,
grants totaled 750 milhion, and now
reach 4.7 billion. But now, as then.
% of this total is for research.”

“We cannot allow the government
contract to become a substitute for
intellectual discovery,” Hatfield con-
tinued. “Qan we not solve our hu-
man problems with the same spirii
Which made us first in space?”

Just last fall it was suspected by
many that Duane would abandon
the Allman Brothers Band to join
Eric Clapton's new group, Derek
and the Dominoes. But after record-
ing that group's new album in Octo-

“After Midnight”), Duane decided
to return to his own group.

Vocals are almost by definition
the weak spot in any white blues

a black imitative role as singer (a le

David Clayton-Thomas), or you
take what you can from the biues

Allman has to be counted among
those in the former category, but
substantial praise is due him for the
restraint and dignity he brings to the
role; watching him sing is a cultural

David Donald Delivers
Founders’ Day Address

Dr. David Donald, a leading au-
thority on the Civil War and Recon-
struction periods, addressed the
100th Founder's Day Convocation
Tuesday. The ceremony, annually
celebrated on General Lee’s birth-
day, carried an added significance as
the formal commemoration of the
centennial of the title change from
Washington College to Washington
and Lee University by act of the Vir-
ginia legislature.

Dr. Donald, presently the Harry
C. Black professor of American his-
tory at The Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, spoke in Evans Dining Hall on
“From One Reconstruction to An-
other: Lessons from Robert E. Lee.”

The author of many historical stu-
dies, Professor Donald was co-

author of the defensive text on the
“Civil War and Reconstruction” and
was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in
1961 for his biography of “Charles
Sumner and the Coming of the
Civil War.”

Following the opening remarks
delivered by President Robert E. R.
Huntley, Dr. Donald offered his
view on reconstruction in the South
and the failure of Southerners to
heed Lee's advice on political and
racial reconciliation.

“It is easy now,” he said, “to sum-
marize the labors of the revisionist
historians, many of themselves quite
Southern, who had to challenge the
sacred taboos and myths” of the old
South. Most of their efforts, he
maintained, have been directed to-
ward refuting the stereotypes of the
reconstruction era in the South.

“Revisionists have disproved fa”
more than they have proved,” he
continued. “And General Lee’s views
on political and economic issues of
the era have been sadly neglected
by historians.”

Dr. Donald noted that Lee always
stressed one theme following the
war: that of reconciliation with ihe
Union, without bitterness toward the

people of the North. He quoted a

post-war letter in which Lee, tien
president of the college, encouraged
Virginia's Governor Letcher to take
the dreaded oath to the Urion:
“True patriotism sometimes impells
men to take action exactly oppo ite
to a previous one . . . we must De

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

January 20, 1971

For Your Information, Sirs...

Issue: Relevancy of R.O.T.C. in the Washington and Lee cur
riculum.

Opinion of “Not Relevant”: Mr. Gingold and Mr. Newman.

Opinion of “Relevant”: The Ring-tum Phi.

Look up for a moment at the masthead above our editorial
column. It reads “Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi,” not
‘Both Sides of the Coin.” Oddly enough, two writers of letters
to the newspaper this week seem appalled that these column:
are reserved for our editorial opinion.

One of the cheapest short cuts in winning any argument is
to (a) claim that your opposition is not presenting “the facts”
on your side and therefore is not at all credible (perhaps entitl-
ed) in his opinion, (b) claim that the other side knows as well
as you do that they have violated some code of elusive ethics in
the expression of their opinion because they haven't taken into
account “the facts” (i.e., your point of view), (c) pompously
proclaim that the opposition has presented false issues and that
your issues are the right ones, ergo, the opinion of the other
side must be discounted.

Well, maybe these writers are interested in winning an
argument. If that’s the case, we congratulate them on their
interest. But why don’t they argue instead of carp about how
we missed their interpretation and then kindly offer their help
in enlightening us? We'd be pleased to print their opinions
anytime in our newspaper.

After the dust settles on what those writers feel the “real
issues” are, our editorial of last week stands as our estimation
of what the R.O.T.C. mini-crisis is all about.

Staff Editorial

Once Again, Remarks On Apathy

Student apathy has long been a topic of considerable popu-
larity here. For years, students have found themselves sub-
jected to great deal of reproach from faculty and administra-
tors, as well as considerable self-condemnation from their peers
through letters and editorials. We would be the first to admit,
however, that much of this has been warranted.

Last Friday, Dr. Charles Hamilton, Professor of Urban
Affairs at Columbia, spoke as a guest of “Contact '71” on the
subject of the Black Studies Programs. No newcomer to the
field, Dr. Hamilton has literally established the black studies
program at Columbia, and has had much to do with establish-
ing the program at Harvard.

W&L offers only one course directly concerning the his-
tory and culture of the American black and that course is of-
fered only in the spring. In the past several years the Univer-
sity has given much consideration to incorporating addi-
tional courses into its curricula.

It is interesting to note, however, that only five members of
the faculty or administration were present Friday evening for
Dr. Hamilton's address; although upwards of 20 turned out
for the basketball game one hour later.

\t a time when the question of broadening present curri-
cula to include additional black studies courses is before them,
it seems rather odd that so few educators are willing to edu
cate themselves not only about the various rationale behind
black studies programs (Dr. Hamilton listed six); but also
about the advantages and disadvantages inherent in each.

Is the faculty, excepting those five who were present, above
furthering their own education, or do they perhaps suffer from
the same malady with which their students are so often evi
dently afflicted ? C.F.H.

Contact’s Second Week In Review

BY DAVID OLSON

Monday night in Evans Hall the
Republican Senator from Oregon
Mark Hatfield gave what I thought
to be the best speech so far in this
year’s “Contact” program. We'!
known for his opposition to the War
in Vietnam and the invasion of
Cambodia he also showed his per-
spiracity in the field of education.
He pointed out that the federal gov-
ernment has not in recent years been
giving enough to institutions of
higher education.

While realizing that, he also point-
ed out that dollars are not enough,
that the universities of this country
that are in such financial trouble
must also realize the importance of
human needs of the students of the
society as a Whole. He also said that
ithe political situation in this country

—e

‘

is in just as much trouble, What it
all came down to is that there has
been a lack of moral leadership on
the part of the White Hiouse and
that somehow the spiritual life of
this country has lagged. We must, he
pointed out, concern ourselves with
humanizing our institutions to the
needs of the people,

What made this such an enjoyable
speech to hear was the fact that Sen.
Hatfield did not pull punches. He
stated the unfortunaite fact that thos:
who screamed the loudest last May
somehow got lost on into the fall,
He cited the fact that in the recent
campaign for Senator in New York,
Conservative candidate James Buck-
ley had more “young people” work
ing for him than did either Goode’!
or Democratic candidate Richard
Ottinger. He deplored this because
he felt that in some way these candi-

dates had been deserted, He did not
pull punches with his colleagues in
the Senate. He stated that they had
deserted him in his and Senator
Goldwater’s quest to pass a bill for
an all volunteer Army.

Senator Hatfield certainly earned
my respect for his willingness to talk
and his willingness to criticize where
he felt something was wrong even in
his own party. It seems that Senator
Hatfield’s willingness to talk is a
'eason that could be learned by other
members of his party.

Last Friday night in the Chapel
Dr. Charles Hamilton gave an eru-
dite address on the Black Student
movement and its effect on the Aca-
demy. While it might seem that this
influenc ehas been only to disrupt,
Dr. Hamilton pointed out that the
demands made by Black students «1¢
‘legitimate and necessary, These are

 

Dr. Harold Taylor, former president of Sarah Lawrence College, will speak on “The Student Revolution” Friday at Lee Chapel

necessary because the institutions
involved need to be forced into a
necessary study of the Black in this
country. There is a great need he
said for a gathering of empirical
datia on the Black.

What the university has to do is to
re-examine its “normative” values so
that it can accommodaite Black stu-
dies programs. He expressed the
warning that schools that cannot af-
ford a good Black studies program
should not attempt it. What has hap-
pened is that too many schools have
tried and have not put forth good
programs. But above all else the
Black student movement has raised
relevant and important questions
for the academic community that
has forced the Academy into dealing
with questions about the Black that
have been overlooked for too long.

 

hat’s To Come In Contact ’71

BY MATT COLE

Tonight, a subject will be dis
cussed that has been mentioned by
every one of the speakers of CON-
TACT to date. Dr. Arthur G. Han-
sen, the President of Georgia Tech,
will talk on the problems of a tech-
nological society, with particular at-
tention to the problems of pollution,
aml! the environment.

A noted authority on the subjec!
of the inter-relation of technolog,
and social sciences, he feels very
strongly that though tremendous
strides have been made in the fields
of technology. and though techno
logy has solved many problems. it
has in turn created many problems
In addition, he feels that people thai
deal with technology often are so
caught up in their work, that they
forget to look at the whole picture of
society. Dr. Hansen will talk on
“TECHNOLOGY OUR TERROR
OR OUR TRIUMPH.”

Dr. Arthur G. Hansen was named
President of Georgia Tech after serv
img as dean of engineering there for
three years. In being named to the
job, he was elevated over four vice
presidents of the institution. H.s
youthful enthusiasm and innovative
ideas have gained him wide respec

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

With regard to your editorial

make an effort to seek out both sides
of the issue. Your editorial was no*
based on issues we afe stressing,
only the issues you would like pec-
ple to think we are stressing.

You know as well as | that if a
radio station in this country did
what your paper has done with that
editorial, the FCC would have a
good case for revoking the station's
license. Any time you feel an obliga-
tion to “seek out” the facts on our

Huntley Discusses Ford Madox Ford Book

When H. Robert Huntley left the
University of Wisconsin in 1962, he
took with him a half-finished doc-
toral dissertation on Ford Madox
Ford and the germ of a further study
that would take nine years for frui-
tion. The result, The Alien Prota-
gonists of Ford Madox Ford pub-
lished by the University of Norta
Carolina, and now available, as-
sumed its final form at the Univer-
sity of North Carolina and at Duke
University during Dr. Huntley’s re-
cently ended leave of absence from
W&L.

Ford, an English novelist who
thought out his novels in French be-
fore writing them in English, is best
known for his role as an editor dur-
ing the early 1900's. His magazine,
The English Review included articles
by Thomas Hardy, Joseph Conrad,
John Galsworthy, W. H. Hudson,
and H. G. Wells. He is credited with
having discovered P. Wyndham
Lewis, Ezra Pound, and D. H. Law-
rence and was first to encourage
Ernest Hemingway.

In an interview with The Ring-tum
Phi, Huntley described the biggest
‘boost to his study as the oppor-
tunity to revisit the books he had cut
his teeth on as a boy: “My father’s
shelves were filled with people like
H. G. Wells, Bulwer-Lytton and a
tot of third and even fourth rate
Victorian novelists that no one even
talks about anymore, but they were
the sort of thing I grew up with.
And, lo and behold, I found that I
could use these things. A lot of the
time second and third rate writers
can give more insight into what is
going on in a period than first rank
literary people.”

The book will be valuable to stu-
dents of Ford but also to anyone in-
terested in the transitional period of
history between the late 1890's and
the first two decades of the 20th cen-
tury.

Huntley devotes much of the book
to discussion of prevalent theories
of history in the late 19th century,
especially the doctrines of Hegel,

American Oil Grant
Awarded To W@L;
Will Help McCormick

An unrestricted grant of $2,500
has been awarded to WAL by the
American Oil Foundation, President
Robert E .R. Huntley has announc-
ed.

The gift was presented by H. H.
(eq) Scott, representing the Founda-
tion.

The gram will be used, President
Huntley said, to help meet financia!
needs in the university's Cyrus Hall
McCormick Library.

Blaine J. Yarrington of Chicago,
president of the foundation's board
of trustees, said the gift to Washing-
ton and Lee is one of 110 being
made to outstanding colleges and
universities throughout the nation, in
recognition of the acute financial
pressures private higher education
must face.

and Schopenhauer but only in the
popularized versions circuluted
among the general public of that
period. “By the time the ideas that
influenced Ford had filtered down
through the popular understanding, ’
Huntley said, “they had become so
warped, so distorted from what had
originally been intended that they
bore little resemblance to those (ori-
ginal) ideas,”

Huntley motes that Ford himself
made little pretense of scholarshir,
once drolly commenting: “All of the
notes I ever made for my historical
novels were contiained on the backs
of three or four calling cards and
then were only dates.”

In truth Ford drew elaborate
tables to aid his framing each pro-
‘tagonist in a carefully etched histori-
cal and psychological landscape.

Huntley argues that the protago-
nists, though variable in temper-
ment share commonality as victims
of Fordian future shock.

“Almost inevitably,” Huntley said,
“Ford will take a character and he
will give him the characteristics of,
say, the late resistance and will put
that figure into an uncongenial tine
slot somewhat later in history, and
there all of the attributes that wou!d
have been advantages in another age
‘become detriments . . . What For
gains by doing this is that that figure
becomes a satiric device by which to
see certain unadmirable qualities in
that period. Inevitably his alien prv-
tagonist is a very admirable sort of
person and the particular cultural
milieu in which that person finds
himself is not at all admirable. *

One is apt to remember Mark
Twain's very different use of time
travel in A Connecticut Yankee ‘n
King Arthur’s Coart in which a mod-
ern-day technocrat exploits medieval
ignorance and superstitution. in re-
sponse to this Huntley said, “Twain's
knowledge of the Middle Ages, as
any Twain scholar would admit, was
extremely superficial and his sort of
crude ironies are really very puerile
things.

“This so outraged Ford that he
determined to write a novel depict-
ing what the Middle Ages were
really like, and he too took a figure
from the modern period and sent
him back into time. But whereas the
Yankee dominates the age through
his superior intelligence and moral
superionity-attributes which we like
to feel make us the finest example of
the whole evolutionary process .. .
Ford shows the modern man as be-
ing ineffective, weak, superficial, ef.

fete, and incapable of doing any-
thing once he steps out of a subway
tube.”

“Ford would loved to have been a
medieval man. To him it was one of
the last periods in world history
when there was a social system that
a man could live by and he knew
how to make judgments between
right and wrong, good and evil, be-
cause there was a standard that he
could believe in, not the modern
brand of effete wishy washy agnosti-

cism.” His protagonist of the Medie-
val period, is able to survive only
after embracing the medieval; Fordi-
tudes of muscle, ethical integrity and
faith,

Students who know Huntley's lec-
ture style will recognize the book's
cogent reasoning and concise prose.
Huntley has deftly treated Ford’s
‘lifelong fascination with the determi-
nistic forces of fate, revealing the
protagonists as tragic and at the
same time strangely contemporary.

 

With Malice Toward Some

A Little Insensitivity

BY JEFFREY B. SPENCE

I don’t know how many of you
read the material on the various
bulletin ‘boards around the camp-
us. However, if every once in a
while you should, you will find that
some very interesting reading is in
store for you. If you want only min-
or excitement there are always the
E.C. or University announcements.
One may find further diversion in re-
viewing the various petitions that are
posted, all of which eagerly await
your signature.

However, if you are an avid bul-
letin board follower you can have
tthe great privilege of reading the
continuing adventures of the John
Birch Society. Persual of this litera-
ture is sure to bring you many mom-
ents of delightful humor, wnfortun-
ately the informative quality of these
messages tends to be nil. The man
responsible for this weekly levity is
Mr. William Melhany, who is the
head of the Society's local campus
chapter.

The most recent publication by
Mr. Melthany’s group is entitled:
“Another Warning About Sensitivity
Training,” which appears to be a
follow-up to an earlier Birch publi-
cation. The warning we are given is
not to enter sensitivity training
groups. The reasoning behind this
warning is that they are actually at-
wek groups for the purpose of de-
stroying a person’s hand and forc-
ing him to submit to the terror of
his surrounding peers.

He further warns us that these
groups are strongly similar to group
procedures used for brainwashing
that were found under Hitler and
are presently found under Chairman
Mao. This is all a gross distortion.

Cook's reaction to the Trouba-
dour Theatre has been “pleasant
surprise at the professional attitude
of all concerned.”

According to Cook, the physical
twyout of the Troubadour Theatre is
“better than that at many other
places.” It “provides a great deal of
freedom, but there is a need for
more rehearsal space and movement
class areas.” He feels that this defici
ency can be remedied either by ex-
panding the present building or ac-
quiring another small building to
use as a rehearsal area.

Sensitivity training is a personal
growth process whereby the indivi-
dual learns to increase his sensitivity
to persons around him. It further
teaches the individual new forms of
self expression and develops one’s
ability to listen, observe, and to trust
others.

The agencies in this country which
are recognized as authorized training
Organizations are sponsored by an
ecumenical group of religious in-
stitutions which represent all of the
major Jewish and Christian faiths.
The two largest of these organiza-
tions are National Training Labs, or
N.T.L., and the Middle Atlantic
Training Conference, or M.A.T.C.
N.T.L., the oldest, is a subdivision
of the National Council of Churches.
Obviously, these organizations are
neither Fascist nor Communist.

When going on a sensitivity ses-
sion no one is expected to sell his
soul to the group he is in. He is also
not expected to give up his indivi-
dual rights or beliefs so as to gain
favor from the group or any other
individual. However, it seems that
the Birchers would have us believe
that these sessions are to create
some kind of collective slavocracy
Where one loses his individuality.
One is not expected to lose his mind
nor allow himself to be pushed to in-
sanity and there are professional
trainers to make sure this does not

I know what I'm saying because i
have extensive experience with this
type of training. If professionals run
tthe sessions then there will be no
trouble, if one goes to something
run by amatuers then one is bound
to have danger. N.T.L. and M.A.T.C.
are professional organizations.

Mr. Mclithany claims this insight
into sensitivity training because he
states he has studied this process
and has attended a training lab run
by official Esalen Institute trainees.
This is meaningiess. One cannot
study sensitivity training, it must be
experienced. | question Mr. Mcll-
hany’s experience when he says he
attends sessions run by official
trainees. I am an official trainee of
M.A.T.C, but that does not make
me a trainer. It is by official trainers
that one must do sensitivity trainir g.

The art of half-truths seems to
permeate this most resort piece of
John Birch Society literature. 1:
even extends to the questionable
chiim that to remove or deface the
said piece of literature is a Student
Control violation. This is odd since

Varsity Ballplayers
Capture Two Games

BY PALMER TRICE

The crucial period for the W&L
team has begun. For openers, the
Generals dropped a heartbreaking
76-53 loss to the Middies, at An-
naipolis. Playing perhaps their poor-
est game of the season, the Blue
looked bush. Further comment
would be repetitious, The most en-
joyable part of the contest was pro-
vided by WNVR. Unfortunately,
‘technical difficulties prevented our
own station from broadoasting the
ball game.

However, amid the din of Dore-
mus, the Generals stormed back

over the weekend. Friday night they
took on St. Pauls College. St. Pauls,
in spite of the fiact that they average
close to 100 points a game, walked
onto the court winless. The Generals’
forte, “the Big D” (defense), led
them to a 74-68 decision over the
visitors. This was quite a feat, es-
pecially in light of the Navy game.

Coach Verne Canfield expetced
Bryant College to be one of the
toughest battles to date. Showing a
new team pride, the boys put it all
together for a 77-72 victory. Bruce

grabbed 12 rebounds. His perfor-
mances have earned him another
starting role. Bruce, my choice for
player of the week, averaged double
figures both in rebounds and in
points. Hatton Smith played his fin-
est ball game to date, garnering 18
points and five assists.

Against Bryant, Captain Mike
Daniel returned to excellence, as he
shot a remarkable 60%, and wound
up with 25 points. This game mark-
ed the high point of the Generals’
season.

Over the last five years the Gen-
erals are 52-7 at Doremus .This
year’s record is 6-0. The question is,
“Qan the team win on the road?”
That should be answered this week,
as the Generals travel to Johns Hop-
kins and to Davis and Elkins. Vic-
tories here would break the “away
game” jinx.

At the present moment, the W&L
hoopers rank 15th in the nation on
defense . . . . Hopefully, ‘he Gen-
erals have found their best five. The
starting line-up will include Dave
Stone, Hatton Smith, Bruce King,
Paul McLure, and Mike Daniel.
... Bruce King will give Paul Mc-
Lure some needed help on_ the
boards. Maybe he will turn out to be
the key to the explosion of the W&L
offense? Hope it is, but some of us
are waiting for Charlie Strain to
blow up for about 25 points. We're
behind you Charlie.

“But who, disguished as Jim O’-
Brien, mikd«mannered _place-kicker
for the Baltimore Colts.”

So could go the spiel for the
young University of Cincinnati alum-
nus as he makes the banquet rounds
this year as the man who upstaged
The Man, Johnny Unitas. Whether
you liked the game as a whole 0%
not, the latter probably being the
case, you've got to admit it was ex-
citing in the end.

For Tom Landry and the Dallas
Cowboys, it will be another anguish-
ing six or seven months. The Texans.
although far from sharp, appeared
to be the better of the two elevens
for fifty-nine minutes. Then, Fate,
which can no longer be associated
with Chance where the Cowboys are
concenned, made its inevitable ap-
pearance.

Craig Morton, reverting to stand
ard form, fired an interception to
Mike Curtis, who carried the bal!
imto field goal range, then O'brien
kicked the winning three-pointer and
stepped into the pages of history.

For the most part, the game was
a model of buffoonery. Neither tc 4m
looked like a conference champion,
and I kept expecting Curt Gowdy to
announce that the real Super Bow!
would be played next week. The

Captain Mike Daniel drives hard for basket in 74-68 General victory over St. Pauls.

 

 

Dallas pass rush was formidable and
effective, harrassing Unitas and Earl
Morrall all day. Unitas was parti-
oularly bother, incurring a hairline
rib fracture as the result of a crush-
ing George Andrie tackle .

At the same time, however, the
Cowboy offense was less than spec-
tacular, and when you take away
part of its running game as the Colts
did, it became downright sme!'y.
Dwice the Colts held off Dallas
drives which ended in field goals.
Morton, even though looking better
than usual, was bad. No matter how
hard Baltimore tired to give it away,
the Cowboys wouldn't accept ii.

The Baltimores looked extremely
weak the first half, as Unitas com-
pleted only one pass in the first
quarter. Then after that graceful 76
yard touchdown pass, the Colt line
decided that the game woull be
much more exciting at 6-6 than at
7-6, so it allowed O'Brien's PAT to
be booked.

At other times, the two teams ap-
proached top-raie calibre. Dallas
executed the flare pass to Duane
Thomas for its only TD quite well.
And the Colts never quit trying m an
effort which ultimately yielded vic-
tory and $15,000 per man. With

A. strong wellamanned Virginia
swim team posted a convincing 77-
36 victory over the W&L Generais
last Saturday at the beautiful, new
VMI pool.

W&L coach Bill Stearns empha-
sizes the fact that the Virginia squad,
composed of nearly twice as many
varsity members as the Generals
team of eight, took advantage of
rested swimmers to pull neeied
points. Yet the Generals did not fo")

Bill Brumback swept first in both his

Steve Erickson, Jim Lawlor, and
Bim Clark, to a new pool, W&L

iSuper Sunday Thoughts

It would be an injustice for a
Baltimore fan to ignore Super Sun-
day even though by now thousands
of words have passed through th:
media to the bleary-eyed spectator.
I too have something to say.

Moot commentiaries have reflected
on a “Stupor Bowl” in which two in-
ept teams fought a ridiculous fiasco
labelled football game. In the Wash-
ington Post, Shirley Povich wrote
in a most demeaning manner of both
teams as if they had come straight
from the sandlots. Liitthe note was
taken of the past season and remark-
able records boasted, and after the
trophy was awarded, the twenty-
eight games before were forgotten
for one game in which something
spectacular had to occur. I take as
reference the four other Super
Bowl Games, each of which had
lopsided scores and none of which
was a super game. Then Balltimore
(a once NFL power) meets Dallas
and the game is terribly close, ter-
ribly tense, and truly not an exhibi-
tion of what the average viewer
knows of football.

And we were wanned of what was
to come. The great Johnny Unitas
seemed overly cautious when he

as human as the rest of us.

By the way, Baltimore now stands
2 out of 3 in championships this
year. Maybe it’s our way of making
up for two years ago when our ihree
major teams made it to the final
rounds of their respective champion-
ships only to fall to the New York
powers. Well, it looks like Big “B”
may have the last laugh.

Maybe it’s because Willie Joe's on

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

BY MONTY COTTIER

Tynanny, barbarians, — political
schemers abound in this film version
of the Broadway success, “The Lion
In Winter,” which begins today at
the Lyric.

It was in this film, as Eleanor of
Aquitaine, that Katharine Hepburn
won her third Oscar as Best Actress.
Peter O'Toole, playing opposite het
as Henry Il, was nominated for the

Best Actor award, as well, thus in-
suring that at least a modicum of
talent participated in the film’s crea-
tion.

The Machiavellian plots, subp ‘ots,
and plot twists provide admirable
foils for the thespian talents of the
featured players, although the m:vie-
goer who feels that good acting is a
thing self-sufficient unto itself, and
that nasty jolts for the sake of nasty
jolts do not a great movie mane, is
in for another session of mixed fee!
ings as he watches touches like Ric-
hard the Lion Hearted being present-
ed as a pervert, King (then Prince)
John chasing after his father’s mis-
tress, and so on.

All stylistic cavilling aside, hovw-
ever, it is interesting to note just
how much of a “Katherine Hepburn
flick” this is. Obviously, O'Toole is
nowhere near the competition whicn
her old friend Spencer Tracy was,
and one is struck by how mantully,
yet how ineffectually, O'Toole strug
gle to keep Miss Hepburn from
“stealing everything bul the cam-
eras,” as the old saying goes. This

fact, they are almost too credible.
One has the impression that the plo:-

the director's “Cut!”

For those interested in social
commentary, “Lion” has its serious
side, as well. When Eleanor says that
there, in the year 1183, she can see
the darkness and the bright eyes in
the jungle that is their lives, one can
almost see the darkness and bright,

W&L CIRCLE K

On Muddy Reviewing
(Continued from Page 2)

ithe existence of “sick” revolution-
aries is nonsense. Throughout his.
tory there have been revolutionaries
from societies as divergent as the
world is wide. Also, I would like to
call Mr. Olson's attention to the fact
that simply because a revolutionary
surfaces in the middle of society
does not mean that the existing soc-
iety created him any more than soc-
iety can Claim to create the genius.

To accept the idea that society is
responsible for the existence of the
“sick” revolutionary requires that we
form a concept of something inher-
ently wrong with society. Further-
more, acceptance of that concept
would force us to regard the revoiu-
tionary as being one of a very few
truly perceptive people. And the om-
pirical facts of history simply refuse
to bear us out in that idea. A more
likely hypothesis to exphain the exis-
tence of revolutionaries would be
that they arise out of a regrettable
combination of incidents and order-
ing of events in their lives which
mold them into the type of person
Dr. Toole desoribed.

Mr. Olson proceeds to present the
episode between Dr. Toole and the
student in the balcony as “a perfect
example of why we have “sick” rev-
olutionaries.” Mr. Olson fails to
note that Dr. Toole twice tried to
answer before he was allowed to
speak, that his “sluffing it off was
a reaction to the student's badgering
(not cries for reform), and that Dr.
Toole had already spoken of an un-
fortunate breakdown in communica-
tion making it nearly impossible io

tendency could be described as “tun-
ing out” or “deaf ears,” a tendency
exhibited by the young man in his

comments from the balcony sum-
ming up all of Dr. Toole’s com-
ments as “bullshit” with his hat still
on.
This is further manifested by the
fact the reforms the student sought
and those Dr. Toole backed were
really much the same. If not, there is
a real wainp somewhere.

Two more comments are in order,
arising out of but not directly irace-
able to Mr. Olson’s article and Dr.
Toole’s appearance. First, r:gard-
less of how liberal we are, we must
admit that not all, I repeat, not all of
the reforms sought by anyone ate
necessarily correct. The possibility
of error is great. | could propose,
and fight for, if I so desired, many
absurd reforms.

Secondly, change, that is, reform,
very often cannot be instanteneous.
As Dr. Hamilton pointed out Friday
night, it may take a long time, and
just beating a man physicaily or
forcing him to do as you demand
does not change his mind or, most
importantly, his attitude, In fact, by
really angering him you are likely to
reinforce his opinion, in mary cases.

On Missing Books
To the Editor of The Ringdum Phi:

Once again we find ourselves fac-
ing the age-old problem of how to
keep reference books from leaving
the confines of the library, or from
being secreted in such locations with-
in the library so as to insure their
use by only a few.

I don't mean to imply that refet-
ence books aren't continually “dis-
appearing;” anyone who even infre-
quently makes use of reference m-
terial eventually confronts this prob-
lem Rather, someone has officially
called a specific instance of missing
reference material to the attention
of the Student Library Committee in
the form of a complaint.

Consequently, last Wednesday, the
Committee met in closed session to
investigate the incident. Partial guilt
was established, and an individual
was duly fined. The committee, i1-
cidently, is empowered to levy fines
wpwards of $50.

This is only one incident. Unfor-
tunately, all too many incidents 50
completely unreported, leaving stu-
dents often for weeks without access
to assigned material.

If an individual removes refer-
ence material, and, for that matter,
any library material unlawfully, he
is not only subjected to a fine, but
also, if no intention to return the
material can be established, he may
be considered as a possible honor

At best, however, an individual
depriving his classmates of materials
by untawfully removing them is be-
ing extremely inconsiderate.

The Student Library Committee
has had this point driven home once

too often. Students and faculty, as
soon as they are aware of material
missing or suspect that someone may
be misusing material, are encourag-
ed immediately to notify members of
the committee or the library staff.

The Student Library Committee,
in turn, will attempt to do its part
to discourage would-be offenders,
and failing this, will deal with those
who would completely deprive oth-
ers for their own selfish gain.

Chairman, Student Library
Committee

In Baroody’s Defense

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

It comes as something of a sur-
prise to me, after five and a half
years at W&L and dozens of letters
to The Ring-tum Phi that never got
outside my skull, to find that Messrs.
Tebo and McMillan have finally
driven me to sit down at the type-
writer. Certainly there is no point
to any further discussion of “Love
Story” as a piece of literature; as
W. H. Auden has said, it is a waste
of time to kill someone who is not
long for this world anyway.

In any case, Mr. Baroody (and 1)
are judging the book by literary
standards which its hordes of ad-
mirers are Obviously not prepared to
accapt—and why should they? Hav-
ing made our point once, there is
thus nothing for Baroody and me to
do but shut up.

But the “Love Story” phenomenon
is more disturbing to me than just
another lapse in popular taste. To
one who would have liked to believe
the claim of the present generation
of students that it was going to cur:
the afflictions of our poor old neuro-
tic country, it is disappointing to find

‘se students no better at recogniz
ing the symptoms of the disease than
their older brothers and sisters.

1 would like to suggest to Mr.
McMillan that just by looking
around him, he could find things
happening every day that would pro-
vide him with all the grief and happ’
ness he can use—and happening to
real live people at that. (Of course,
getting your emotional thrilis by
the TV dinner method is unquestion-
ably less trouble. In fact, falling off
a log takes a heroic effort compared
with reading “Love Story.”

So I say to everyone who thought
it was heartless of Mr. Baroody to
squash the pretty butterfly that if
you looked at the remains, you
would have seen that it was not a
butterfly at all but an assemblage of
transistors and printed circuits, cle
verly miniaturized and painted to
look like the real thing.

A note: I had intended to remain
strictly impersonal, but on rereading
Mr. Tebo’s letter I find it remare-
ably offensive in any number of
ways, and so | feel inclined to say a
word about it. On reflection, I find
that the word that best desoribes Mr.
Tebo's letter is “puerile.”

On Convention

By TOM MAYS
Sophomore EC

Since September of th's academic
year, significant improvement has
been made in our student govern-
ment, it is surprising that we have
come up with such a progressive
form as the University Council.

Why is the University Counc’l
such a worthwhile innovation? Some
might conjecture that it will give
students more substantial power, or
that students will finally take their
rightful place in the decision-mak'ng
processes. But more than these the
Un‘versity Council will most assur-
edly provide a point from whic
faculty, students and administrators
may develop new ways of working
together to solve crisis as well as the
long-term problems facing the Uni-
versity.

The key to the eventual success cf :

the U.C. as an ideal structure of
“community” government, may be
found within the relationship be-
tween faculty and students. Gen-
erally speaking, one must admit that
each indivi has his own source
of experience which provides him
with usable data.

One might hypothesize that the
most valuable relationships an indi-
vidual is able to have are those here
he is giving of his store of data as
well as receiving.

lt is unfortunate that the relation-
ship between faculty and students is
often one in which the data goes
all one way. The lecturer gives and
the listener receives, and although
there are exceptions, rarely does the
situation reverse or attain an equili-
brium.

The importance of this relation-
ship does not only concern academic
matters. We cannot expect that tra-
ditional relationship such as this
w'll disappear just because it is po'nt-
ed out. But through such means as
the U.C. and the participation of
students on faculty committees a
mutual trust and understanding
should develop and the barrier to
fuller cooperation between facu'ty
and students should be surmounted.

Such a movement would of course
be beneficial academically. lt would
tlso be a great step in the right
rection for those who envision tha’
in the next few years “student gov-
ernmem” and thus “faculty com-
mittees” will combine their in‘ores!
in favor of a “community govern-
mem.”

This is certainly an idealistic pros-
pect. And with our present form of
governmmem the evolution to suc) 4
state would be ardurous if not im-
possible. There are too many s'ruc-
tures at presem that tend to inhibt
new ideas from growing and wh'ch
from year to year only perpetunte
themselves and remain complacent

Thus the Exeoutive Commitice in
order to shed some of the anachron-
isms that bind it, to achieve maxi-
mum input of ideas from the stu-
dent body and to gather community
opinion, has called a Constitutional
Convention to be held in February
on the weekend of Friday, February
12, 1971.

Delegates to the Convention wll
he selected at-large from the stuton
body. Anyone desiring to attend the
convention as a delegate should
register himself with Student Body
Secretary Rich and then pow hs
potition on a bulletin board that wil!
be in the Co-ap. Twenty exclusive
undergraduate signatures will be
necessary. A Rules Commitice select
ed by the E.C. will draw up pro
cedures beforehand and the dele
gutes will vote upon these when they
convene. Delegates from the Law
School will be chosen by a means
determined by their Board of Gov
ernors

It may seem inoredible, but w
before us an Opportunity to
crewte an entirely new and
respomsiev form of government, In
this type of convention we will be
sble to review the weaknewes of th

IFC President Doug Gossmann
Cooperative, Rush
Examined By IFC

The Interfraternity Council meet-
ing Tuesday night considered several
topics Which members said were of
mportance to the W&L student
body.

Among the subjects acted upon
was a proposal by members of the
University Center Committee that
the UCC, the IFC and the Dance
Board join in supporting and run-
ning a dance on Feb. 19, the night
before the Feb. 20 concert, to make
two big weekends that month.

The proposal was based on the
assumption that the three organiza-
tions would have an equal share in
the cost and management of the
dance, to be held in Evans Dining
Hall, with beer concessions and
other facilities to be arranged later.

Members of the UCC reported
that the proposal had been under
consideration by that group for some
time, and had been mentioned to
both the IFC and the Dance Board
previously.

Last night's action was seen as the
culmination of several weeks’ of
attempting to find a replacement for
Fancy Dress without actually re
viving the ball itself.

The motion passed the IFC, and
plans on the dance are being drawn
up.

Another item brought up befor:
the IFC last night concerned the
food cooperative which was forme!
ths past semester. The lack of suc-
cess in this attempt was the subjec*
of a new report which was presented
to the members of the body

A new cooperative is being con
idered, but, if attempted, it is no
expected to be of the same size a
he first one. New prices and de
l.very methods are being looked in’

“It will be an open session, and
all fraternity men are invited,” they
said. “We hope that they will come
and air complaints they have with
the rush system of last semester, and
propese changes and alternatives.”

Members of the IFC have made
no secret of the fact that they were
‘opleased with the way rush went
‘is year. Many felt that the rush
period dragged on excessively, and
hat freshmen as well as upperclass-
men were bored with the long dura-
tion.

Another point mentioned in con-
nection with rush was the confusion
which many houses had over the
exact rules governing rush, several
of which were altered midway
through the period this year.

In other action before the IFC
last night, the Sigma Phi Epsilon
fraternity announced to Gossman
that the members had decided to
withdraw from that organization.

Reasons cited were a disillusion
ment with the IFC, based on the
SPE's exclusion from the IFC sum-
mer rush booklet, the rush date
cards, and the student directory, as
well as financial considerations
which made IFC dues an unneces-
sary expense.

A Consiiutional Convention will
convene Feb. 12 to propose a new
Washington and Lee student body

meeting, the Executive Oommittee
passed a motion (9-1, Craig Jones
opposing) calling for:

Class of ’73
Makes $200
Contribution

Last Thursday the sophomore class
council headed by President Rick
Grey voted to donate $200 of the
surplus class funds to a local cloth-
ing drive for school age children.
The drive was initiated last fall by
members of the Rockbridge County
Welfare Rights Organization and was
directed by local TAP (Total Action
Against Poverty) and VISTA offici-
als,

Lois Walker, local TAP commun-
ity worker, stated that the drive was
origninated because of the lack of
Federal Title 1 funds, funds with
are ordinarily used to purchase
school clothes for needy children,
appropriated for Rockbridge County.
As a result, many county children
lacked adequate winter clothing. The
drive could not be completed, how-
ever, due to the lack of donations
of both clothing and money.

Last month the Bureau of Cathe’.
Charities donated $100 to the drive
and that coupled with the W&L
contribution, enabled the drive to be
a success. In addition to these funds,
soveral of the Lexington churches
also contributed clothes and money
to the drive. Two W&L students,
Robert Lewis and John Brymesser,
also made generous personal con-
tr butions. Two other students, Kurt
Krumperman and Mike Peck asssist-
ed in the running of the drive.

Cocktail Party
Will Be Held

Saturday, February 6th marks the
60th anniversary of Fancy Dress
Weekend. To commemorate this oc-
casion the Dance Board has done
away with the Fancy Dress Ball,
but kept the cocktail party. The
party will be held at Zollman’s Pa-
vilion from 2 to 5:30. Music will be
provided by the Eye. Reports from
the Fancy Dress high command say
that the drink served will be a bour-
bon mix. If it should run out (and
there is a good chance) provisions
will be made to handle BYOL.

2) Delegates to the convention
will be selected in the undergradu-
ate school based on a petition of
25 exclusive undergrad signatures,
and in the law school 5 delegates
selected by a method devised by

the Board of Governors. The Ex-
ecutive Committee will be voting
members of the convention.

3) Rules of procedure will be

drawn up by the EC, the Consti-
“utional Sub Committee, and ap-
proved by the delegates to the
convention at the beginning of the
session. (The convention delegates
will adopt necessary rules con-
cerning adjournment, recess, etc.)
Signature lists and other convention
information will be posted at the
Co-op Monday-Thursday of next
week.

Russ Fletcher was seleoted as the
new Freshman EC representative in
a lengthy Exeoutive Session prior to
the meeting.

Other business included discussion

 

of a system for faculty evaluation
and a report from Henry Harkey
concerning the Student Financial
Relations Committee.

Harkey reported a drastic increase
in cold checks passed by W&L stu-
denis in this academic year. $1786
in checks have been covered by
Financial Relations thus far ($616
just prior to Christmas), Chairman
Harkey voiced the hope that this in-
crease would not seriously jeapordize
the student check cashing priviliges
in Lexington and asked the EC for
suggestion to curb the problem,

Harkey expressed his feelings that
“the solution is not heavier fining
for these offenses, but better com-
munications.” The EC recommended
signs for the cash registers of local
merchants, but decided to defer any
drastic action until the Spring term.
It wa salso noted that the Financial
Relations Committee may have to

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

January 27, 1971

A Lesson In Identifying
A Splattered Tomato

This is getting ridiculous. We apologize to our readers
for this continuing series in editorials over the R.O.T.C. con-
troversy, but Mr. Swart's letter appearing in today’s issue has
provoked what will have to be a rather lengthy repetition of
what we tried to state succinctly in our inaugural attempt.

Mr. Swart is anxious to point out our responsibility in
arguing the issue of R.O.T.C. on Mr. Newman's terms. May
we remind Mr. Swart that he has a responsibility also?

Both he and Mr. Newman are intent on insisting that the
issue at stake is the “academic worth” of the R.O.T.C. pro-
gram, Think now. How is academic worth defined? If your
answer to that question is “it is defined by whether or not a
course relates to the body of knowledge which an institution
is in the perpetual business of exploring,” then you may read
on. If you've come up with a different answer from that, then
our ultimate definitions of academic worth are not the same,
and there's no point in pursuit of any further discussion.

Our editorial of two weeks ago was a discussion of the real
issue: “relevancy” of R.O.T.C. in the W&L curriculum. Mr.
Swart and Mr. Newman's terms of “academic worth” is, as
far as we can ascertain, a lot of hollow rhetoric which is mask-
ing their real complaint about the presence of R.( ).T.C. as an
academic program at W&L.

So, the issue is not relevancy but “academic worth?” In
answer to Mr. Newman's “lucid and knowledgeable argu-
ment” in last week's newspaper, he puts forth two rhetorical
questions which are proof enough for us that the phrase “aca-
demic worth” stinks of the popular cry of “relevancy” just
as much as if Mr. Newman had attempted to convince us
that someone had splashed red paint against a wall when in
reality someone had splattered an overripe tomato.

We quote: “How do marksmanship, map reading, small
unit tactics communications, military courtesy and drill strike
you as academic subjects? Is that the kind of thing the school
gives credit for?” No, Mr. Newman, don't try to make a simple
issue complicated by saying you're not questioning its rel-
evancy and that what we were concerned with was a “trivial
sidelight.” This is the most pompous proclaimation we've read
in a long time.

Then we come to Mr. Newman's “in all fairness” paragraph
in which he isn’t being fair at all. Don't you think the geology
department at W&L would be somewhat upset if they knew
you thought that any instruction in map reading was “voca-
tional?” What about other courses at W&L which encourage
students into activities of a vocational nature, such as the
stagecraft course at the theatre or the sculpture courses?
Academic credit is given for these courses; what's the dif-
ference? The difference is not in the work, but in the relation-
ship of the student to the work,

As we stated in our first editorial, the issue still remains
whether or not a student should sign up for the R.O,T.C.
program. If he does, then it’s just like signing up for any
other major—there are courses he's required to take. Mr. New-
man finds the cadets in the corps as being reluctant to losing
the credit in these courses because of sentiment such as “Why
lose an easy A?” We know of one student who didn’t make
the popular Dean's List last semester because of the grade he
received in his R.O.T.C. courses. The question of R.O.T.C.
being an advantage to one’s GPR seems to us to be moot at
best,

As for making one’s course load lighter, Mr. Newman has
disproved that statement in part because of this comment:
“Il put over five hours a week into those classes.” A lot of
work, And doesn't he take four courses at three hours credit
apiece? Even if he doesn't, five hours of work a week for two

hours’ credit for the term seems pretty fair to us.

Finally the conclusion of Mr. Newman's not “totally un-
qualified” assessment of the relevancy of R.O.T.C. is the fact
that the army chooses its own instructors just as the depart
ment heads at W&L do. What do you know? Of course, here
at W&L, the with the administration, in
K.O.T.C. as well as with the other departments, but the de

final say rests
partment head is the man who handpicks instructors in his
Is Mr. Newman suggesting an alternative? Is there
a logical one? Why shouldn't the army select its own men to

own field

teach? Should the philosophy department pick them?

We see this whole mini-crisis as an attempt by Mr
man, Mr

New
Swart, et al to attack a set of courses which thes
don't like and which they feel that they can eliminate from the
catalogue by means of rhetorical window shopping. Behind
all those words is the plain and simple fact that they don't
like R.O.T.C, A subjective point of view which this editor
shares with them

But on a campus which in the past few years has grown
much more “liberal” than it used to be, doesn't it seem odd that
there are fewer people willing to allow some students have an
opportunity to take what they want to take? Indeed, people
aware that R.O.T 4
tudents to attend

scholarships make it possible for some

school here? Toleration, where hast thou

flown ?

A Few Objective Facts For
The Current ROTC Question

By SKIP PAUKERT

The issue of whether or not R.O.
T.C. courses deserve academic credit
has evidently arrived at W&L, and
it seems likely that the resulting
polemical furor might have settled
in for a few weeks.

Of course, any question that in-
volves the presence of the United
States Army on the campus now is
bound to fill the editor's box with
letters. But some would say that to
pass off a real look at the issue be-
cause of its national context is un-
fair—and they would probably be
right.

So this week The Ring-tum Phi
has attempted to obtain some facts
to help us all to make an appraisal
of the question as it pertains to
this campus. Several questions have
been raised deserving exploration.

The basic fact is that the univer-
sity has signed a contract with the
Department of the Army providing
for the maintenance of a Reserve
Officer Training Unit on this campus.
The unit comes to the college upon
invitation by the college.

The stipulation included in the
contract requires the university to
assign some credit to the courses
offered ‘by the Military Science de-
partmem. The amount of that credit
is solely determined by the Com-
mittee of Courses and Degrees.

“We accept whatever the Com-
mittee thinks is a fair slice,” sad
Col. Jack Morris, head of the M/i-
tary Science department. “My job
is to see that we do have the utmost
academic quality in our courses.”

It was also suggested in one letier
hast week that the Army “chooses the
faculty.” This, however, is not
exactly true. The Army does nomi-
nate men to serve as R.O.T.C. in-
structors, but they must be inter-
viewed and hired by wunivers'y
officials under the normal procedure.

Candidates for instructor are col-
lege graduates, with oredit from
Command and General Staff Col-
leges, plus two year’s duty as an
assistam professor.

Once to this point, several factors
enter to complicate the matter of
academic creda for a military pro-
gram. The question is basically this:
(a) Is the content of such courses
iwtellectually challenging and/or
practically useful to merit university

credit? And (b) if the military pro-
gram were relegated to the status
of an extra-curricular activity, would
there be a severe drop in enroll-
ment?

Let us take the ROTC course of
study out of context, and question its
academic merit. How is this possibly
determined objectively?

“We think our courses go hand-
in-glove with other courses, to en-
able students to learn to think ra-
tionally, logically, in dealing wth
human relationships,” offered Col.
Morris. “Take a sampling of the
things that a future officer might be
taught: management of materiels,
techniques of business transaction,
procurement, leadership. He is ex-
pected to use good judgment, and
have the normal character qualities
for responsibility. We want our stu-
denis to be able to apply what they
learn.”

Along with the marksmanship
and drill, a R.O.T.C. student is in-
sructed in map reading, military
history, land navigation, military
justice, and Organization and Opera-
tions, And these courses don't seem
to be feasibly susceptible to course
isolation.

Efforts have been made to estab-
lish cooperative map reading pro-
grams between the Military So'en::
and Geology departments. And after
the R.O.T.C. schedule is adjusted to
the new curriculum, it is hoped that
further changes can bring the R.O.
'.C. department up out of the ravine
academically.

At present the R.O.T.C. program
carries a total of 11 credits for four
years. A senior who puts in five
hours a week gets two credits for
the term.

Col. Morris expressed the dilem-
ma faced by the R.O.T.C. faculty.
“We do not offer a major in our
course, and, therefore, can't take
up too much of the student's time.
We must maintain that balance be-
tween offering an academic chal-
lenge and still not taking up an ex-
cessive number of his hours.”

The matter, then, proceeds to 4
central question: if credit were re-
moved would it jeopardize the unit's
existence?

“We have no crystal ball,” said
Morris, “but I think I can say that
it would have an adverse effect.”

Olson Examines
Courses Group

By DAVID OLSON

Phe state of the Curricutum Com-
muttee’s report to the faculty about
the option for Juniors and Seniors to
take the'r courses Pass/Fa:l is now
in question, Lex McMillan said that
the report was rewritien by him but
that at this point it did mot have “a
snowball’s chance in hell” of passs-
ing the faculty. He felt that the
faculty just would not buy it. He
aso made the point that the facu!y
was reticent about any change at ths
o.nt because they want to clear up
the problems with 12-12-6 before
embarking on any new change.

When asked about the state of
12-12-6 at this point McMillan said
that he guessed that “more than half”
of the faculty was against the system
bu: that the spring term would be
the crucial period. “We oan’t treat
it like a vacation,” he said.

MeMillan was also displeased
with the attitude of the faculty. He
feels that they change some things
and think they have given us great
advances. He pointed out that the
faculty is reluctant to embark on
any real changes that might change
che texture of tthe school.

1 can not help ‘but sympathize
with the plight of the Ourriculum
Committee. They have no power,
operate in a vacuum, and thus they
must continually be frustrated. The
Pass/Fail is a viable option for stu-
dents who do not plan to go on to
graduate school. It seems, that the
necessity of grades is only a neces-
sity in relation to graduate schools.
If this is to be one’s last institutional
educative exeprience there seems to
be little need for grades.

In relation to the new calender
there seems to be quite a bit of
faculty displeasure with the set-up.
I can only agree with Lex McMillan
that the spring will indeed be the
crucial period and that no faculty
member or student can honestly

Students, Administrators
View Exchange Program

By DOUG BURTON

At a time when unisexual uni-
versies are considered perverseies
by advocates of coeducation, the
male-female exchange program has
found a place for itself at WAL.
Two W&L students are now at Hol-
lins College: a third has just re-
turned, and though the initial re-
ports of the program's success are
good, yet there are some kinks.

The program's avowed purpose
stated in a WAL brochure is “to
broaden the educational opportun
ties of the students in the cight
participating colleges; to provide a
diverse campus environment for the
students visiting other campuses and
for the students who remar on their
own cimpuses, and to be an initial
limited experiment in cooperative
vencures among these cight colleges,
possibly leading to more extensive
programs in the future

By JEFFREY B. SPENCE

This campus has all sorts of
people who care about the world
around them. The problem is that
when it comes to worrying about
right here at W&L it seems like no
one gives a damn, For example,
take a close look at our campus. li
is beginning to look like a maze of
meandering mud ruts. About two
months ago Fran Lawrence ran up
a warning flag to the student body
concerning the appearence of our
campus, apparently his warning went
unheaded.

One © fthe most beautiful campus-
es in America is taking a beating be-
cause our concerned students have
their heads so high in the clouds
ithat they can not seem to find the
walkways that are converiently
located all across the university. One
wonders why their heads are so high
in the clouds. Well, the wonaering
doesn't last long. You can travel to
almost any college surrounding us
and they wil Itell you that We&L is
the main outlet for drugs in these
parts. What do they know anyway?
Who cares what they say? They
don’t even go to schoul nere how
coul dthey know?

It is safe to assume ‘that those cut-
siders don't have all the facts; but
there must be some reason why they
would carry tales like some of the
ones that are going around places
like R-MWC, No, we are not the
main outlet for anyone except may-
be ourselves, With all the flap about
R.O.T.C., traditional dress, Love
Story, and local civil suits, it seems
like someone might pay some atten-
tion to ithe fastest rising problem on
this campus,

Those of you who are in the drug
scene might control your supercili-
ousness for just a minute. Although
it isn't widely known we have al-
ready had to hospitalize students
from W&L who thought they knew
all about the use of drugs. They
were not basically unintelligent stu-
dents, but they were stupid. Stupid
enough at least to believe that if
one is hip and has done some dope
that he can handle anything. Obvi-
ously there are a few who can’t.

Pot smoking isn’t the problem so
throwing some students out of the
dorms for doing it is useless; except
to clear our collective conscience
that we are attacking the rising use

of drugs. The problem is found
with the use of chemicals and hard
dope. There has been some talk
around W&L that a center similar
to Roanoke’s TRUST center is being
planned. It is an excellent idea, as
far as it goes. This center will cer-
tainly help those experiencing a buin
trip, but what does it do to prevent
the problem from starting?

It is imperative to repeat here that
Pot is not the problem. Not every,
not even a majority of students who
use it go on to higher stuff, any
more than does tthe average drinking
man here become an alcoholic. How-
ever it seems that if we are truly con-
cerned about our fellow students and
the university as a whole we might
get into something that vill offer
us not just information aout, but
constructive alternatives: to, those
who feel they must use potentially
destructive chemicals on their bodies.
Raise hell about something worth-
while for once! Peace.

 

Dean of Students Lewis G. John is one of several administrators respon-
sible for the exchange programs involving W&L. (see story page 2).

I was reminded the other day that
there were many people my age who
were out “in the world,” mot in a
sheltered university community. One
is constantly reminded that there “is
a world going out there”; indeed,
there is a world “out there,” a world
in Which children starve and people
kill. But there is also a world in
here, a world in which people are
starving for lack of communication
and thoughts are being killed by
hollow rhetoric.

I cannot help being a bit amazed
iby those who are so anxious io point
to the “real world.” This is the real
world—or so I have thought, but
perhaps my mind is noi suitably ex-
panded—as much as anything else
that lies outside the 60 miles radius;
this is the world in which we live. I
have always believed that one should
be more concerned with the wrold
in which one lives, until one has oon-
trol over it.

Letters Discuss ROTC Question

Dove on Freedom
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Academic freedom has recently
been used as a justification for giv-
ing R.O.T.C. courses academic
oredit. What is academic freedom?

Many R.O.T.C. students feel that
their behavior is restricted because
of their participation in the R.O.T.C.
program. Many R.O.T.C. students
complain that they cannot wear their
hair as they wish. Many R.O.T.C.
students do not feel that they can
participate in anti-war demonstra-
tions. Many R.O.T.C, students do
not feel that they can write letters
to The Ring-tum Phi criticizing the
army, the war, the draft, or R.O.T.C.
Many R.O.T.C. students allege that
files are kept on their ‘behavior in
and outside of the classroom. In
short many R.O.T.C. students do not
feel that they have much “academic
freedom.”

The R.O.T.C. department is un-
like any of the other departments at
our school. In order to take one
course in military science, one has
to sign up for a whole program of

of the campus the students are en-
courage dto ask questions. The
R.O.T.C. faculty is not controlled
in any way by Washington and Lee
University. Yet their instructors can
voie in faculty meetings.

The R.O.T.C, faculty is not hired

of the faculty. The R.O.T.C. faculty
is pushing a career on us as no
other department on this campus is.
It would seem that U.S. Steel should
be permitted to settle on the campus
to mold exeoutives if the army is
permitted to mold officers.

To give academic oredit to a de-
partment in which there seems to be
little “academic freedom” seems to
be contrary to the purposes of a
liberal arts institution such as Wash-

_ington and Lee.

Gingold on “Facts”
To the Editor of ‘The Ring-tum Phi:

OK. You are saying that you've
got the right to editorial opinion,
and I'm saying yeah, but it would
be a good idea if you had some
factual basis for forming your opin-
ions. By factual, I'm trying to get
at HONEST—that is to say, opinions
based upon first hand information
from BOTH SIDES—which you
know you did not have.

As for winning an argument, you
also know that one man’s editorial
opimon in any newspaper is guing
to have greater influence than any
man’s opinion. So, what i'm getting
wt here is that you have a responsi-
bility to the people who pay for
that paper that has been used «as
YOUR paper. Why don't you just
say that the editorial you wrote
about ROTC was your own one-
sided, slanted, second or third per-
son viewpoim. But don't give us that
“the opinion of the PHI" rebop.

I can't condemn you for your
opinion especially when | know that
you didn't get the facts from all the
sides. But I can wonder just where
you got the idea that you can turn
a school paper into a personal piece
of inferior journalism, If you need
direction on how to do a really fine

job, all you have to do is go up-
stairs a flight or two and speak to
Hugh Hill and the folks at the
school radio station. Until then, and
us hong as you keep up with that
diddley, I’m gonna keep right on
sending you nasty letters.
Jeff Gingold

Swart defends Newman
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

I would like to comment on your
recent editorial: “For Your Informa-
tion, Sirs...” Which seems to be a
reply to the letters of Jeff Gingold
and Everett Newman. Your petulant
reaction to Mr. Gingold’s letter ap-
pears to have clouded your judg-
ment where Mr. Newman is con-
cerned,

In your first paragraph you say,
“Oddly enough, two writers of let-
ters to the newspaper this week seem
appalled that these columns are re-
served for our editorial opinion.”
Wrong. Nowhere in Mr. Newman's
letter is there any remark which
questions your right to state your
edtiorial opinion in your editorial
colunyn; there is merely disagree-
mem with your opinion on this
issue.

Now to the “cheapest short cuts
in winning an argument.” (a) If you
“claim that your opposition is not
presenting ‘the facts’ on your side
and therefore not credible,” you are
taking a cheap short cut. But if you
presem facts, which the opposition
has failed to present or presented
falsely, so that an impartial observer
may judge their merit, you are re-
futing the argument of the opposi-
tion. I'm afraid Mr. Newman has
you there. I read nothing in the peti-
tion about asking for votes on
courses relevancy, ending the Veit
Nam War, or excluding people from
continuing in R.O.T.C., as stated in
your original editorial. It seems as
if someone other that Mr. Newman
is taking a “cheap short cut.”

(b) Mr. Newman does not “pomp-
ously prockim” anything. He simply
says outright that you “set up false
issues and then proceed to demolish
them,” and then cites facts in a
rather good argument to establish
that this is so. If you do not agree
that what he says # true, then refute

his argument with facts, rather than
dismissing him as a “pompous pro-
claimer.”

I had not previously formed an
opinion on the R.O.T.C. issue, but
Mr. Newman thas presented a lucid
and knowledgeable argument for re-
viewing R.O.T.C.’s academic worth.
You have not answered his argu-
ment. You have dismissed him for
challenging your editorial rights,
which he did not in fact do. You
have misstated his methods and mo-
tives, then attacked them, all the
While ignoring his argument. This is
the cheapest short out for winning
any argument. I challenge you to
refute factually Mr. Newman's argu-
ment, as stated in this letter, point
by point. I ‘believe it is your edi-
torial responsibility (every right car-
ries @ responsibility) to do so.

Peter Swart

Colvin on Ecology

To the Editor of The Ring4um Phi:

As a result, perhaps, of the
Contact Program or just a general
quickening of public interest in en-
vironmental problems, some students
have come to me and asked how
they can personally participate in the
fight to save nature from the dispoila-
tions of man.

Two quick suggestions: $7.50 is
the price of membership in the
“Wilderness Society” which brings
with it regular mailings of Wilder-
ness Reports and conservation alerts,
or for $17 one can join the “Sierra
Club,” in my opinion, the most active
fighting outfit in the conservation
cause. Both organizations are eager
to tell you how to effectively partici-
pate in getting things done or getting
things stopped. Both provide an up-
to-date report on all conservation
issues before Congress and before
State legishatures.

lous and insensitive (after hysterical,
however, everything willl be anti-
climactic) for questioning the pre-

vailing order of priorities, but
how can one set out to make
the world wonderful ( or safe

for democracy or whatever) without
first making one’s own surroundings
more liveable? I do not deny that
there is need for food in Pakistan,
‘but there is also a lot that needs
to be done here—in Lexington, Vir-
ginia. 1 still cling to the outdated
notion that one’s resources are better
used in tending to the needs of one’s
own circumstance; we must cultivate

our garden.

Our garden cannot be cultivated
until we, as gardeners, decide what
we are going to plant in the garden.
And we cannot decide what we are
going to plant until we can com-
municate in an orderly fashion
among ourselves. If we all continue
to consider each other's opinions as
equally imvalid, we shall never be
able to decide upon hew our garden
grows. But we cannot even consider
one another's opinions when, for the
most part, they are totally ubscured
by meaningless catch phrases.

Until we disencumber our thoughts
of trite epithets, we shall be for-
ever caviling about the definition of
a weed, and not how we are going
to get them out of the garden. Per-
haps the situation is hopeless;
perhaps many of our woull-be

gardeners are in fact, the weeds
choking our garden.

With wrestling season half over,
the Washington and Lee wrestling
team is looking for more successes
in future matches than ‘they have had
in previous ones. Due to tough
competition and sickness on the
WA&L team, the Generals have won
only one meet, against Guilford,
while suffering four losses, to Duke,
U. Va., U.N.C. and V.M.1. But pros-
pects for the second half of the sea-

Generals Win on The Road

By PALMER TRICE

This past week was perhaps the
most crucial of the Washington and
Lee basketball season. The Generals
‘ook to the road for two big bali
games, one with Johns Hopkins, and
the other with Davis and Elkins.
While the squad did not play its best
game of the season, it played well
enough to win, and did win both

games.

The first encounter was with John
Hopkins. Led by Paul McClure’s 16
points and 15 rebounds, the Blue
marched to a 72-62 victory. Mike
Daniel had a season high of 6 assists.
For the game, the Generals shot a
torrid 52 percent from the floor.
They also used a height advantage
to dominate the boards. This ad-
vantage has been a rarely seen one
this season, and the visitors made
the most of it. The offense, which
has lacked a punch, looked better in
spots.

When Coach Canfield traveted to
Davis and Elkins, he knew that his
team would be facing a real run and
shoot team. He was right. The home
team took 91 shots (that’s no mis-
print). This was in spite of the fact

that the Generals enjoyed a 63-45
rebound advantage. In a fan-pleasing
exhibition Davis and Elkins ‘took
shots from everywhere. Some of the
26 that they made were absolutely
incredible. Still the percentage was a
mere 29 per cent. The Generals
made six less field goals, but hit
seventeen more foul tries. The score
was 66-61. Defensively, the Generals
showed a man for man, a match-up,
and a half court zone press. The
victory raised the record of the W&L
roundballers to 9-4,

Wednesday night, the Generals
play Pembroke State. For those of
you that have never heard of Pem-

‘broke, it is located in Pembroke,

North Carolina. Their record thus
far is 10-5. Their front line features
three men over 6'4”. Remember, the
Generals are 52-7 at Doremus.
Hats off this week to Skip Litcht-
fuss. He came off the bench in the
Davis and Elkins and garnered 10
points and 13 rebounds .... For the
season, Mike Daniel is averaging
17.6 points a game .... Dave Stone
follows with 10.6 per game .. . For
the year, the Generals are averag-
ing 68.5 points per game, as com-
pared with 65.8 for their opponents.

The big game of the week, and,
perhaps, of the year, wil ltake place
at University Hall on February 2,
when our Generals take on the 19th
ranked Cavaliers. At first glance, it
would appear that we are playing
out of our class. At second gl snce,
it would appear that we are playing
out of our class. But do not give up
hope yet. Wait until after the ball
game. The Virginia squad has sev-
eral advantages. Hopefully, so do the
Generals. The night before this con-
test, the Cavaliers travel to Colum-
bia, South Carolina. This could have
a slight effect. Offensively, the Bluc
will run a 3-2 spread, in an attearpt
to neutralize the vast Virginia heighi
advantage. Coach Verne Canfie'd
also noted that, perhaps, the Cava-
liers can be pressed. Defensively, he
will employ a match-up defense.
Particular emphasis will be placed
on attempting to limit the second
and third shots taken by the Cava-
hiers.

history is made. Don't study history,
make it.

go against Towson State. Though
this will be no easy match for W&L,
the Generals have a good chance to
win if they can capture the crucial
lower weight classes. Dee Copen-
haver, the team’s captain, should be
wrestling better now that he has
recovered from ‘the flu. The vacancy
at 190 pounds, left by Bard Wrisley,
who has a ‘torn ligament, will be
filled ‘by Jay Fulcher.

Future meets are scheduled with
Loyola and Hampden-Sydney, both
small schools against whom the Gen-
erals should compete well. W&L will
also compete in a newly scheduled
tournament with American Uniiver-
sity, Catholic University and Gal-
laduet. With the toughest part of the
season over, Coach Cohen might be
able to light his victory cigar soon.

LaRue’s Press Box

Notre Dame and Austin Carr

Word has it ‘that the National Col-

Athletic Association, the
body which governs the sports pro-
grams of America’s institutions of
higher learning, plans to launch an
investigation in to the activities of
one of its members, Notre Dame.
Urged to do so by Darrell Royal
and John Wooden, coaches of high
stature in the minds of other NCAA
members, the governing agency in-
tends to investigate the possibilities
of a special dispensation for that
Catholic University by one Pope
Paul.

Irish fans, still giddy from ther
team's New Year's Day upset victory
over Number One Texas, had even
more to crow about Saturday as
Notre Dame surprised UCLA’s top-
ranked ‘basketballers 89-82.

The two victories were similar in
nature; both times Notre Dame end-
ed lengthy winning streaks. Royal's
Longhorns were stopped after thirty
consecutive gridiron conquests and
the Bruins, prior to their efforts in
South Bend, had won 19 straight
under Wooden. But this year the
Irish have shown a tendency toward
the upset.

The combination of a red-hot
Austin Carr and an ice-cold Sidney
Wicks was too much for UCLA,
which never managed to ge! any
farther than a 47-47 tie. Carr pour-
ed in 46 points and was a priceless
psychological factor throughout the
game, as his unerring acourexy prov
ed virtually unstoppable. Equally de-
moralizing for the West Coast
quintet was the poor showing of its
ace, Wicks, who although accumu-
lating 23 points, was far from sharp

The entire Bruin team reflected a
poor showing with fifteen turnovers.
Another strong factor in the Irish
victory was control of the buards,

es i ee aca

 
  

thanks mainly to the efforts of John
Pleick.

The game was close to being a
carbon copy of another affair that
took place just three years and a
week ago today. Before a packed
house in the Astrodome, the Uni-
versity of Houston led by Elvin
Hayes clipped Lew Alcindor and the
Number One Bruins by 71-69. That
year Aloindor and UCLA came back
to avenge their loss, beating the
Cougars in the NOAA plaoffs.

Although UCLA has since been
beaten by other West Coast Fight
teams, the loss to Carr and the Irish
was the Californians’ first im non-
league competition since the Astro-
dome encounter,

All of which raises the question——
will lightning strike twice? A re-
match between Austin Carr and
Sidney Wicks in the NCAA playoffs,
simeilar to the UCLA-UH faceoff
three years ago would probably
prove to be a real juicer. And if it
comes off, the Pope will be plenty
busy.

Blunder, Irish, All-CAC

I hate to dwell on past matters but one can't help comment-
ing on the most recent revelation concerning the Blunder Bowl.
It seems that only two (out of many) calls were vigorously
protested by the Cowboys—one being the Johnny Unitas-to-
Eddie Hinton-to-John Mackey 75 yard touchdown pass, the
other being the one-quarter inch line fumble of Duane Thomas,
which was awarded to Baltimore.

After countless slow-motion, frame-by-frame, stop-action
scrutinies of the game film, the officials’ conclusion was drawn
that the Unitas pass was legal—though quite lacking in execu-
tion—but get this, the fumble was actually in Dallas posses-
sion, being recovered by center Dave Manders.

One certain official, name unkown to millions who saw
him, testified that he must have blown the ball dead and ruled
a Baltimore recovery while actually the ball was not in pos-
session of either team. Could you call this a job of poor officiat-
4 ing? More on the line of a junior high or high school game,

to be precise.

Skip Lichtfuss

Exemplifying this point of the officiating further was the
full-page color shot in last week’s “Sport's Illustrated” of
Baltimore defense back Rick Volk yanking at Reggie Rucker’s
face mask to the tune of an offensive pass interference call.

Colvin On Ecology
(Continued trom Page 3)

From a personal observation,
based on 17 years of active duty
on the conservation front, I would
say that the best way to participate
is to take one issue (not more) in
your own home State, inform your-
self about it, take the measure of
the opposition, actual and potential,
and get to work doing what you can.
Nobody is impressed with petitions
or form ‘letters.

But a well-written letter to the
editor, or a ‘brief to the Federal
Power Commission, or a reasoned
analysis sent to your Congressman
or Senator can pay off handsomely.
The main thing is to have the facts
and argue them dispassionately (but
not too dispassionately.)

To the Editors:

In December, I sent you a short
letter outlining the value of personal
reporting. Since that time, my sug-
gestion has been ballooned into a
farsical and facetious column,
“Quirks and Quibbles,” written by
one Monty Cottier—ipart time movie

Your lamentation that no one had
responded to your personal reporting
seemed to be a personal dare for
me to show my face again, (no
matter how many miles of “bad
road” it resembles), so | now re-
spond.

If you think that you have suffiici-
ently extinguished my small flame
of criticism or cowed me into morti-
fied silence beneath your giant waves
of sarcasm and thinly-veiled insults,
then you are greatly mistaken. |

certain degree of humor and in-

However, you must not allow
your surprising dislike for myself

assocition” involving faculty, stu-
dents and administration in solv'ng
some of our more essential problems.
One area of concern must be the
role that the student body's elected
representative play in fund raising
and in decision on capital develop-
ment. How can students take a
greater role in a problem which con-
cerns the long-range quality of W&L
education.

Secondly, what about commun ty
spirit and its manifestations in en-
tertainment and sports, This is cer-
tainly important for two reasons.
One would be its potentially postive
effects on applicants and role as a
portion of what could be a better
life at W&L.

My impression has been that W&L
being as compact as it is, having all
the advantages of a small rural
sc'vool, has much less fun as a com-
munity than it ought to have. How
can we bring faculty member and
student together to find better ways
to utilize our campus facilities, Uni-
versity Center and to raise funds
for a variety of activities. And what
can be done to not only promote
intellectual fervor on campus but
a community “spirit” as well? Not
last, for one could enumerate end-
lessly the possible joint efforts that
should be undertaken by a “com-
munity government” is the future of
the Honor System which must be
preserved as an important component
of W&L life. How can it be strength-
ened and yet be brought up to date?

Finally, we are faced with one
central question. Are we as a stu-
dent body and as a community,
apathetic enough to allow govern-
ment at W&L to remain fragmented
and uwieldy? Do we have the in-
genuity to break away from tradition
and effectively experiment.

 

Of course, enthusiasm for such an
endeavor cannot be stimulated by
one Pinpoint; it is either ready to
emerge or not. However, in some
way, | believe we all want and hope
for better things for W&L in the
future. A better government would
be a start. Support the Constitutional
Convention with your ideas and par-
ticipation,

om Mays Discusses Convention A Few Facts For The ROTC

Question At Washington and Lee

(Continued from Page 2)

In a survey commissioned by the
Department of the Army, it was re-
vealed that freshmen enroll in the
program on campus for three major
reasons: (1) the desire to become a
commissioned officer, (2) a realiza-
tion of the possibility of being draft-
ed, and (3) the offering of academic
credit.

The same survey indicated that
about 20 per cent of all college
freshmen in R.O.T.C. programs de-
cided to join primarily because of
the credit offered.

There has been a steady depletion
in the R.O.T.C, ranks at W&L since
at least 1960. That year a total of
364 out of 1041 undergraduates was
enrolled in the unit, that is, abou’
35 per cent of the undergraduate
student ‘body. Last year the enroll-
ment was 160 out of a possible 1292,
or a little above 12 per cent.

The years 1967 through 1970
comprise the most drastic drop, from
27.3 per cent to 12 per cent of the
undergraduate total.

Of course, there are many fac‘ors
that contribute to this  statisi(cul
plunge, and no one can say how the
new draft lottery will effect these
figures. But one must admit that the
abolition of academic credit for the
R.O.T.C, program is a latent risk to

ma‘ter of past~<lue accounts.

A discussion of a possible system
of faculty evaluation resulted in no
definite action. The University Fed-
eration had earlier in the year ex-
pressed a desire to conduct such an
evaluation, but has found that the
undertaking is unfeasible for them.
The EC members postponed further
discussion until a later meeting,

Olson Examines
Course Group
(Continued from Page 2)

assess this system until that time.
But the fact that a student has to
take more than one course in the
spring term seems to defeat the
whole purpose of a short term.

With the number of hours requir-
ed one almost has to take more
than the minimum in the Spring
term. While it seem sthat the pur-
pose of a short term is to fully ex-
plore ome subject, the set-up pre-
cludes that and it may be just
another term only shorter. This de-
foats the idea behind having a short
term and ruins the possibility for real
intellectual involvement. But we will
have to wait and see.

the already descending roll.

Finally, in order to attain a
latent risk to the already descending
roll.

Finally in order io attain a
thorough appraisal of the R.O.T.C.
credit issue, we should have some
idea of the views of those now en-
rolled. This year the Military Science
department surveyed the program’s
juniors on this and other questions.

The evaluation reveals that 18 of
21 students feel class time is of
“some” to “much” value. 13 of the
21 say the courses are of college
level and intellectually challenging.
All waited their instructor between
the middle and top fifths of those
teachers they have had in the uni-
versity, as far as teaching ability is
concerned. 19 of the 21 indicated
that their subject matter was pre-
sented clearly.

Of course this data, too, must b:
considered carefully, but it clearly
refutes any suggestion that R.O.T.C.
students have no regard for the
academic merit of the program.

A close scrutiny of the academic
status of any department in the uni-
versity needs to be constant and
critical. But for such criticism to be
legtimatte, one must not forsake the
complexity of the issue, and political
iprejudices must be recognized for
what they are.

The Illinois legislator echoed a
suggestion made earlier in the sym-
posium by writer Philip Abbott
Luce, when he encouraged the trial
of the voucher plan for secondary
schools, Chamipioned by many in
the Conservative ranks, such as Mil-
ton Friedman and William Buckley,
the proposal would return a tax
rebate of a set sum to parents with
school-age children so that they
could choose the school, private or
public, which they wished to pa-
tronize.

In theory the voucher system's
vontue would be the introduction of
the free market idea, to set schools
in competition for increased quality.
“The most promising program in the
CEO (Office of Economic Oppor-
tunity) Was an experimental test of
the vouched plan iin selected Cali-
fornia schools,” Crane remarked.
According to Congressmen Grane,
however the proposed experiment
was recently killed by “pressure from
the teachers’ unions.”

Ol EPG cs

By DOUG GOSSMAN
IFC President

It is generally agreed that the ex-
tended rush <*>, which was initi-
ated by the iFC th’s year, took the
“rush” cut of rushing. This was one
of the objeciives hoped for by the
University when it required the fra
ternties to come up with an alterna-
tive to the “Rush Week.”

While this may have been the
case last fall, one thing is certain—
the “rush” that was eliminated was
replaced. unfortunately, by tedium
and apathy for fraternity men and
rushes alike, especially in the period’s
last few weeks.

This problem is only one of the
many presently being studied by the
Interfraternity Council's rush com-
mittee. Headed by Kenny Murov,
this group was formed in November
to evaluate the new rush program
and to offer suggestions for iis im-
provement. To alleviate the prob-
lem mentioned above, the commit-
tee has recommended that the period
be shortened to four weeks, The
statistics from rush last fall justify
such a change, showing that an
overwhelming majority of the fresh-
men that eventually joined fraterni-
ties did so by the fourth week of
the rush period.

Another aspect of the program
that the committee has concentrated
on is the number of regulations
Which limit contact between fra-
ternity men and rushees. However,
the “no-contact” regulations offset
this advantage.

That the “no-contact” rules de-
creased the effectiveness of rush is
further supported by a survey under-
taken by the National Fraternity
Council. This study showed that
schools that did not conduct rush
under the “no-contact” regulations
were usually more successful than
the schools which did impose re-
strictions, Therefore, the rush com-
ntiee has recommended that the
IFC discard the “no-contwet” regula-
bron.

Of course, any new system will
have its flaws and it would obviously
be untrue to suggest that this year's
rush program was an exception.
However, after intensive study, the
rush committce has outlined some
fundamenal changes which should
make mex: year’s rush a snoo.ter
and more effeciive operation.

(Editor's Note: Look for future
Pin-Point articles on rush. the
Executive Committee, the Spring
Term study plans, and other
topics of interest to Washington
and Lee students in upcoming
issues of The Ring-tum Phi.)

Troubs Open Production

Of New Play On The Road

Like wandering artists befitting of
their name, the Troubadours began
their week tour of “Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead” by troop-
ing en masse to Randolph-Macon
Women’s College last night to open
their production.

Their second production of the
season will open at WA&L in the
Froubadour Theater at 8:30 p.m.
next Tuesday and will run through
Saturday.

As the acting company performs
at Mary Baldwin, Roanoke College,
Radford, and the University of Rich-
mond, they will be confronted with
a New stage each evening.

Yet the very act of coping with
problems on the stage is an integral
part of “Rosencrantz and Guilden-
stern Are Dead” dself. Two minor
characters in Shakespeare's “Ham-
let.” Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
have no inkling of what the world
cf Els nore Castle is all about. They
know they were summoned by the
king, Claudius, to discover the cause
of Hamlet's madness. Tha: is all
they know.

Fo; Hamle. Clautus, and the
rest of the Els nore couri, these two
are insignficant pawns in a larg?
drama. Bui for Rosencrantz and
Guildens:ern, the'r plight is extrem-
ely sign ficanmt: they cannot find the
cause of Hamlet's madness no mu‘iter
how deviously they queston, and
they fumble for words before the

Allman Brothers

Will Play This Weekend

Friday and Sw.urday nights will
mark the return of the concert week-
end w.ih two big names on tap to
provide some of the best entertain-
ment of the year. Combined with
numerous combo parties at the fra-
tern.ty houses, this could be the
biggest sociai .vent of the year.

Friday nigii.’s concert will feature
Liv.ngs:on Taylor, ithe youngest
brewher of the popular James Taylor.
His performance will be matched
on the folowing night by the ex-
tremely talented Allman Brothers
Band.

Both conceris are expected to be
sell-outs and those wishing to buy
tickets at the door are advised to
come early to be asured of seat-
ing. There will be a liimted amount
of standing room. Tickets for non-
Dance Plan subscribers will be $10
per couple per night. Each concert
will be held in Doremus and doors
will open shortly after 7 p.m. The
concerts are scheduled to begin at
8 p.m.

The similarities between the styles
and sounds of Livingston and his
brother James are siriking, yet Liv-
ingston still manages to maintain
his identity as something more than
just one of the many James Taylor
imitators currently in vogue.

Now at the age of 19 Liv Taylor
is Out in the world and making a
name for himself. He came out with
an album fast spring, appropriately
ttled “Livingston Taylor.” A cut
from that album, “Oarolina Day,”
has just been released as a single.

fied voice as his brother, and his

Virginia Beats W&L

It was a rough game last night for
the basketball Generals in Oharlot-
tesville as they lost to the Cavaliers
92-70. The Virginia squad, which
has been ranked as high at 15th in
the nation this year, was just too
talented for WAL.

Washington and Lee was never
really close. The Wahoos utilized
a full court press which halted the
WAL offense. The press caused fatal
errors in the first half such as steals,
bad pases and fast breaks for the
home team,

W&L was beaten badly on the
boards. Virginia had several big
men who overpowered the smaller,
less experienced Generals. U. Va.
Strength on the offensive boards was

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

February 3, 1971

Should Daddy Warbucks Get Tough?

December was a record month for the Financial Relations
Committee and its chairman, Mr. Henry Harkey. $600 in bad
checks came into the committee’s hands during the Christmas
rush,

Mr, Harkey and his committee are appalled. And so are we
The grand total to date for cold checks covered by the commit-
tee is $1,700-a record by astronomical proportions for the com-
mittee.

In November the number of checks returned due to “in-
sufficient funds” was alarming enough. We had hoped that stu-
dents would be more prudent after the first indications of a
rise in the amount of bad checks was reported in these columns.
It seems though that there are some who still feel that the Fi-
nancial Relations Committee will always be there (in loco
parentis) to bail them out of financial trouble to the harsh tune
of $700.

The committee, along with the EC, has taken a lukewarm
measure so far: affixing signs to cash registers around town to
remind students that they should have enough funds in the
bank to cover their checks before they cash them. Will this
work? Probably not, because students may continue to sign
their names on the line in the bottom right hand corner of
their checks secure in the knowledge that the Financial Re-
lations Committee will come to their monetary rescue like the
cavalry in a grade “B” western movie, How does the sign
change anything? If there are students who attend Washing-
ton and Lee who don’t know it’s not a good idea to write a
check for money they don’t possess, then we'd begin question-
ing the admissions office. But we have more faith in the intel-
ligence of the student body than that.

However, we have less faith than we had in November in
their integrity and their common sense. We suggest that the
Student Financial Relations Committee and the Executive
Committee alter its policies somewhat and quit playing Daddy
Warbucks for the students. After a fixed number of offenses
(we suggest the number three), the student involved should be
faced with the unpleasant prospect of being turned over for
prosecution by the local merchant to whom the bounced check
was written. After all, we know of no government office which
covers the bad checks of U.S. citizens, And if some students are
really screaming for a taste of the world in our supposedly
closed environment, let the Financial Relations Committee
give it to them after three tries at responsibility.

We suspect that with this added incentive the students of
Washington and Lee will become — if not miraculously — at
least somewhat more responsible when they sign their names
on checks in the future.

Staff Editorial
The Atomization Of Democracy

A Constitutional Convention sounds like a laudable demo-
cratic idea, but is it really that or is it an attempt by the Execu-
tive Committee to change the role and responsibilities of the
EC? It appears that the Convention will be a rubber stamp of
the changes wanted by the EC for the EC,

Throughout this academic year the Constitutional Com-
mittee has made surveys and held forums on the problems of
the current Student Body Constitution, These surveys were
administered to a minority of the W&L community and the
forums were almost exclusively attended by the members of
the Constitutional Committee and the Executive Committee.

\lthough these forums were characterized by minimal
crowds, the EC has called a Constitutional Convention. Judg
ing from the general absence of petitions required of prospec
tive convention delegates, does anybody care? Few seemed
to care about the survey, fewer still cared about the forums
This trend seems to overflow to the Convention, Who cares?
Nobody, Right!

The student government according to the proposed changes
will be divided between the Honor Court and Student Senate
\ll student government and student activities come under the
jurisdiction of the Student Senate, and in a similar manner, all
questions concerning the Honor System are encompassed by
the Honor Court,

In theory this division constitutes a separation of power,
In practice it means a concentration of power for seven indivi
duals, A total of seven of the 12 Proposed Honor Court mem
hers are either members of the Student Senate or appointed
The theory of separate structures with separate purposes is
shattered

Delegates to the Convention are required to compile peti
tions of their intent with 25 signatures, Correction, almost all
delegates are required to file petitions; the EC is exempt, The
EC appointed its 12 members as delegates ex officio, Are the
members of the EC warranted in appointing themselves dele
rates

Certainly not. This Convention will surely

study the re
tructure of the EC. If that governmental structure needs

changes, perhaps

radical changes, the current members seem

unlikly choices as open-minded delegates
Lately the E¢

seems obsessed with delegating its respon
Phat is regrettable, because the EC once accepted th

The Troubadours hit the road this week on a tour to various colleges in the area to present their most recent

“Rosencrantz And Guildenstern”:
A Serious Brand Of Humor

By STEVE HAUGHNEY

In August, 1966, at the Edinburgh
Festival, a young drama critic named
Tom Stoppard saw his first play
performed on stage. It was “Rosen-
crantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.”
Within a year it was a smash suc-
cess in London and New York, and
Mr. Scoppard’s name was being

Signs such as this one were recently affixed to cash registers about

linked with those of such well-estab-
lished playwrights as John Osborne
and Harold Pinter as a leading Eng-
kish writer for the stage.

The basic situation of “Rosen-
crantz and Guildenstern Are Dead”
is quite simple: it is the “Hamlet”
scenario as seen from the perspective

of the two foolish boyhood friends

town as a reminder to students—“Can you cover it?”

Flurry Of Cold Checks
Plagues Committee

By SKIP PAUKERT

WAL students seom to have a
particular penchant for spending
money and cashing checks. Untor
tunately, the nature of this spending
often borders on the precarious, re-
sulting in compound exasperation
for a group of saidents who make up
the Student Finano.al Relat.ons
Committee, or, as most of us know
it, the Cold Check Committee

In an average semester im the past,
the amount of debt resuli.ng from
bad checks cashed by students in
local stores totals about $1000, This
year, however, the sum through De
cember reached nearly $1800, and
this substanial increase in student
negligence has caused considerable
re-evaluation of committee proce.
dures.

“There is no doubt that this jump
in “bounced checks is cause for
alarm,” remarked Henry Harkey,
chairman of the committee. “We've
got to make students aware of the
problem so that they realize how
much they are placing the privileges
of the entire sudem body im serous
peopardy.”

The Financial Relations Commit
tee is the only direct liason between
the students and the community, en
compassing three major purposes
(1) to handle unpaxdd accounts a
crued by students with local met
chants (2) to collect bad checks on
a regular basis from Lexington bus
neses, and (3) to disciphne students
with finne power for delmaquency
in financial matters

Harkey pointed out, “lf by April
Ht is evidert that there is will a
multitude of bad cheoks each week
we will be forced to ret with the
EC to arrive a another policy, some
thing a little more drastic.”

Under the current procedures, th
secretary of the conwnitice vieits Lex

neton store often as once a week

to pick up cold checks and to keep
track of unpaid accounts. The com-
mittee then reimburses the mer-
cham for the amount of the bounced
checks and then notifies the students
responsible that they mus! appear
before the committee at their Thurs-
day nght meeting

Students are asked to explain the
error and are then fined, up to $5
for the first offense, $10 for the
second, and $25 for the third. Fol
lowing the third offense, the stu-
demt faces the possible consequences
of EC action

“We havent had many second
offenders this year, and no third
time offenders as of yet,” Harkey
noted. “But these guys are not the
bulk of the problem—dit is our first
offenders that are giving us trouble

Harkey said 4 was likely thal a
freshman would receive a slightly
higher fine than a senior, the latter
heaving gone through four years be
fore a commitice appearance for a
bad cveok. In the cause of bad ac
counts, he sail, the commiullec
poley is to notify the student of
hes account and to give fim a week

himself before taking any acon

Harkey emphasized that the pu

of Hamlet who are called upon by
Claudius first to determine the cause
of Hamlet's madness and later to
escort him to England. Stoppard
pulls out whole speeches from Ham-
let and inserts them in his own play,
never allowing the audience to for-
get that the tragic action of Shake-
speare’s play is going on, mostly
off-stage, while Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern perform their comic
antics.

Th’s inversion of main plot and
subplot of “Hamlet” is a startling
idea, but it is not of itself enough to
build a good play on. What makes
“Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are
Dead” fascinating is Stoppard’s re-
working of many of the moral and
philosophical problems in “Hamlet”
into the hilarious dialogue between
the two unlikely heroes. Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern are buffoons, like
Viadim:r and Estragon in “Waiting
for Godot,” who debate lofty meta-
physical dilemmas and absurd
mundane matiers wit han amazing
lack of clarity and reason.

Yet Stoppard has a definite
method in his characters’ madness.
What struck me most in reading the
play and in seeing rehearsals was
how effectively Stoppard destroys the
ilhesion of the theatre— that a play,
something artificial and unreal, is
going on beyond the “real” world
of the spectators—in order to in-
volve his audience in the action.
Rosencranz and Guildenstern are
themselves spectators, watching the
performance of the traveling com-
peny, the intrigues of the Elsinore
court, and their own destruction. But
While they watch, they are caught
up in the action and must pay the
price with their lives.

The dilemma of Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern, then, is to be part of
an inexorable flow of events over
Which they have no control: they can
neither influence the tossing of a
coin nor their own fates. They carry
on their search for the wrong
answers to the rght questions, secure
in the belief that “Words, words,
they're all we have to go on.” They
are ignorant of Hamlet's dictum that
we mart sur cur acons to our
words—and, Stoppard implies, so are
we all ignorant. In spite of their
terribly funny davlogue, Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern remain isolated
from the other characters in the
play and even from themselves; they
do not talk by themselves, for they
are not alone, but it seems that they
do talk to themselves. It is here that
Stoppard foouses his very serious
humour

On Sensitivity Training

lo the Ed‘tor of The Ring-tum Phi:

| should bogin by thank.ng all
those persons wao have refia ned
from defacing or deutroy.ng the
many posters | have pu up around
campus. Disagreement should not
require vandalism and | have always
prac.iced ihs bei.ef. | should be able
fo expo. a. sce sheais waich cost
me a dime each will not be destroy-
ed, Also, anything | put up around
school is exclusively of my own
composition and is in no way official
literature from the John Birch
Society.

I am pleased that Mr. Spence has
decided to transfer his disagreements
with me from my posiers to the
pages of th's paper, wiere a more
rational examination is possible. It
was a ceriain Mr. Henberg who in-
formed me lasi May that defacing
or remov.ng posters is a student con-
trol ocmmtiee violation. This was
confirmed by a member of the com-
mittee last semester when I inquired
as to whai | should do with one of
my posters that had been defaced
and triumphantly signed by some-
one claiming to be Jeff Spence. The
poster was a warning against Sensi-
tivity Training.

Mr. Spence’s summary of my posi-
tion on Sensitivity Training is quite
accurate and proves that he read my
poster. He should, however, either
look at pages three and four of the
March 2, 1968, edition of the Chi-
cago Daily News, or write to the
National Education Association; for
it is that organization of which the
National Training Laboratories is a
subsidiary, and not the National
Council of Churches (although many
ecople I know would agree that
such would be a good guess). The
gentleman who conducted the sensi-
tivity session in which I participated
was an employee of Esalen and |
can provide his name and proof that
the session occurred to anyone in-
terested. | think its fair to say that
all offic.al trainers of Esalen, like the
one I met, are also official Esalen
trainees. How else would they know
what they're doing?

Anyway, I happen to believe that
anything tha: can be experienced,
and has been recorded, can also be
studied. The same sensory organs
are involved in both situations. Jeff
seems to think that my worries
about Sensitivity Training don't ap-
ply when the sessions are conducted
by “pocfessionals.” | would only rely
on medical doctors and psychiatrists
in serious matters involving physical
and mental health. Since Jeff doesn’t
specify which “professionals” are
safe, | get the feeling that he be-
lieves that as long as someone gets
paid for conducting sensitivity ses-
sions, this immediately qualifies him
to cope with potentialy explosive
conflict between human personalities.
| hope Jeff doesn't apply this prin-
ciple to the treatment of physical
ilines and then contract a serious
disease. S.nce there are some doctors
who don't thnk its “meaningless” to
try to study things like Sensitivity
Training. it might be well to ex-
amine what they say from research
and experience.

Besides the information on my
poster, none of which Mr. Spence
chose to discuss in detail, we have
the statement by Professor of Medi
cal Physology at the University of
California at Berkeley, Dr. Hardin

With Malice Toward Some

The Subject Out OF Hand

By JEFFREY B. SPENCE

The trial of the Lexington One is
now a matiter of history. The case
invo:v:ng a student and a professor,
both of W&L is well known by now.
In fact, it has been the main topic
of discussion here for the last two
weeks, Now that it is over I say,
Good show, ito all involved. Now,
would someone please tell me whut
it was worth?

Jeff Gingold, who I consider a
friend and a brother, never ceases
to amaze me. He has come from
‘being president of his freshman class
iand the epitome of ithe straight fra-
ternity man to ‘being one of the
freakiest and at the same time one
of the most concerned gentlemen on
our Campus,

Under this direction it looks like
the Bakery Free Library will soon
become an active community better-
ment organization. He helped unify
the extreme feelings that were
aroused last May, and also helped
avoid these feelings being expressed
in a violent manner. He is dedicated
to social reform for the bettenment
of all the people and the world they
live in. So why this most recent
move?

When I inquired as to why, I was
told that we can’t let this type of
thing cominue because this is exactly
what the resistence to oppression is
all about. Somehow I just can’t see
that. It seems to me that my friend
could have spent all that time and
energy he put into that trial on any
one of the programs that he sub-

John Wayne

The premier showings cf “No Sub-
stitute For Victory,” an action-filled
color film about Vietnam starring
John Wayne, Martha Raye, and a
host of military leaders, will be
held at the Lyric Cinema in Lex-
ington on Februray 8th and 9th at
12:30 p.m. The 75-minute motion
picture, scheduled for just two show-
ings in the area, surveys this coun-
try’s involvement in Vietnam and
criticizes in no uncertain terms the
“no-win” policies of recent Admini-
strations. The W&L-Lxington T.R.A.
I.N. Committee (To Restore Aimeri-
can Independence Now), which has
urged a “win” policy in Vietnam and
a halt in aid to the Communists, is
sponsoring the public showing.
Tickets are $2.00 each for adults and
$1.00 each for students.

“No Substitute For Victory” was

of Alaska Pictures. Ken has incor-
porated his own on-the-spot action
films of the war, taken during 19
visits to Southeast Asia, in the hard-
hitting documentary narrated by
Academy Award winner John

scribes to for the greater welfare of
the Lexington community.

{it seems to this observer that the
trial was nothing more than an aot
of personal face-saving. There is
nothing wrong with that, but Jet us
not allow jit to ‘become some great
victory for the prolevariet over the
oppressor. Quite simply because it
was not,

The trial of the Lexington One,
who by ithe way lost, did nothing
more than prove that when law is
put to the test in court and in an
orderly manner, that jit will provide
justice. I grant that if plaintiff and
defendent’s roles were switched that
there might have been a harsher out-
come, but I doubt it. Also the ac-
ousing finger can be pointed at the
system and have it said that if the
roles were switched and the de-
fendent was black that the outcome
might have been harsher.

However this was not the case.
Mr. Gingold sued Mr. Colvin and
Mr. Colvin lost. Justice has been
served, Jeff has saved face, Mr.
Colvin has been admonished to give
a damn. Big deal. Now let us get
on with the business at hand.

Let's quit wasting time and see if
‘we can meet the needs of some of
the people in our campus and
community that are in dire need
our aid and resources. I hope thi
trial will mot ‘be portrayed as a
vietory for the Revolution over the
Establishment, but rather, that it will
‘be taken at face value as a civil tort
suit in which one party wins and one
party hoses.

in his opening remarks sets the tone
for the film: “It’s time we spoke out
about Vietnam and the most obvious,

Other participants in the film,
from former Vietnam Commander

that two major problems confront-
ing our troops are pol.tical restric-

“Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,” the Trowbadours

the million-selling record “The Bal-
lad of the Green Berets,” is even
more outspoken: “It was frustrating
to a soldier half-way around the
world, It seemed like the American
public was only getting the informa-
tion the Reds wanted them to. In
fact, I'd say the press has been more
help to the enemy than a fresh di-
vision!”

Although the mass media receives
plenty of criticism in the film for
its coverage of Vietnam, the harsh-
est condemnation is reserved for the
ipoliticians who have committed
men to battle but refuse to let them
win. John Wayne tells it this way:
“Just as with the Berlin pullback in
World War II, and the hamstring-
ing of the mibitary during the Korean
mess, the no-win policy dictated by
‘behind-the-scenes powers in Wash-
ington is again in force. Whenever
we fight the Communists, they seem
to have help from somebody on our
side. Somebody always wants to bend
over backwards to avoid gotting
tough with them.”

‘Half a dozen military leaders, in-
cluding the former Commander of
Pacific Naval Forces, Admiral U. S.
Grant Sharp, and General Mark
Clark, the World War Il Army
Commander who succeeded General
MacArthur in Korea, agree with
Wayne's assessment,

In fact, Admiral Sharp declares
that if it were not for the restrictions

“invented,”

Back then, vilagers in England
and on the continent had to rely
either on word of mouth or on the
curious Litthe pamphlets called “chap-
books.”

There is, still, however, a_ tiny
group of people who avidly seek out
and collect chapbooks, and some of
the more interesting and noteworthy
examples from one collection—that
of Edward F. Backus of Buena Vista
—whil be on display this month in
McCormick Library.

Mr. Backus, production manager
in the university’s print shop, has
been a chapbook collector for some
20 years. He has dozens of them
now, mostly acquired in Britain,
though even rare-booksellers often
don’t know what they are.

Chapbooks flourished in the 18th
century and in the first third of the
19th, Mr. Backus says, until the
invention of the cylinder press led
to better, quicker and cheaper print-
ing.

Chapbooks were aimed at the
“common folk,” and so above all
they had to be cheap. To meet that
requirement, printers resorted to
using inferior paper, and produced
the Lele books with minimum effort.
The result was that with hardly an
excepsion they were of outrageosuly
shoddy quality.

They sold for a penny or so,
which considering the quality was
not much of a bargain even 200
years ago, and generally were “the
sort of item normally swept out with
the trash,” Mr. Backus says—hence
their scarcity today.

They were sold by itinerant ped-
diers—“chapmen,” they were called,
from the Anglo-Saxon word for
tradesman; hence the term “chap-

Despite their lack of quality, chap-
books had considerable influence on
the thinking of people in remote
towns and hamlets. Apart from the
Bible, according to Mr. Backus,
chapbooks were generally the only
printed mater the rural folk saw
from one year to the next, certainly
the most important.

In the themes, chapbooks were as
diverse as are current books and
movies and TV shows, ranging from
moral philosophy to bawdy ballads
to tales of adventure to political
commentary.

Chapbooks often contained short
“filler” items, alpparently inserted in-
discriminately simply to take up left-
over space. One of the Backus books
on display is titled “The Spaewife;
Or Universal Fortune Teller, Where-
in Your Future Welfare May Be
Known By Physiognomy, Cards,
Palmistry, and Coffee-Grounds. Also
a Distinct Treatise on Moles.”

Usually chapbooks were illustrat-
ed, but—as with the filler articles—
the pictures seldom had any relation
to the main text. Each printer had
a stock of woodcuts, and simply in-
serted whichever blocks were handy,
no matter what they depicted.

The chapbook exhibition in Mc-
Cormick Library, which includes 37
examples from the Backus collect-
ion, will open Feb. 5 and continue
through Feb. 28.

“I have never heard of Tomahawk

ture my son's fifth grade class on
acids and bases,” said Dean at large
of the College of Arts and Sciences,
William Joseph Watt, denying a
rumor somehow gaining credence on
campus. As Dean of the College,
Wait plans to exert a business-as-
usual influence in policy making for

William W. Pusey III.

Watt majored in chemistry at the
University of Illinois and later took
his Master's degree at Cornel] in
1951 and his Doctorate in 1956. He
has served here as teacher and ad-
ministrator since 1955,

As the Dean of the College, Watt
is probably the most commiitted

THE

LaRue’s Press Box

 

Last week, many young men
across the nation waited with bated
breath in anticipation of that nemesis
of youth, the darft. It used to be,
as some remember with fondness,
that a body might have several al-
ternatives. But no longer, with the
new drafit system, one knew exactly
the impending future. Where would
next year find these poor, anxiety-
ridden souls? Germany? Israel? Or
perhaps somewhere in the rice pad-
dies and jungles of Southeast Asia?
Maybe, but more likely it will be
San Francisco, Green Bay, Denver,
or even New York.

The draft held last Thursday de-
termined, at least for the time being,
where several hundred college foot-
ball players would be spending their

time come next August. For the
American and National Football
Conferences had held their annual

post-season rite, the college draft.

And this year’s version was
sprinkled with surpise. Everyone
knew that Jim Plunkett would be
lowly Boston's first choice, and that
Archie Manning was the object of
New Orleans supersieuths. Less cer-
tain but almost as predictable was
the fact that Houston was interested
in Dan Pastorini. Strangely, names
like Moorhead, Kern, and Wooster
were late in making their appear-
ance. But such is the stuff that
drafts are made of,

Chis year, more so than most, the
draft was accompanied by a veritable
snowsionm of trading. Football's
answer to the old-style New York
Mets, the Ph ladelphia Bagles, pack-
ed off Norm Snead to the Vikings:
Green Bay parted with Travis Wil-
hams, and Don Horn getting Alden
Roche from Denver and Zeke Brat-
kowski from the Geritol Corpora-
tion. Oakland swapped Alvin Wyatt
\o Buffalo for Bill Enyart, and Hous-
ton semt Hoyle Granger to the Saints

But perhaps the biggest news of
the entire session was that mammoth
trade engineered by the Los Angeles
Rams and the Washington Redskins,
one of the largest exchanges of naw
flesh made in recent years. George
Allen, recently deposed as head man
of the Rams and now head coach for
the ’Skins, decided it would be much
easier to bring his own men than to
break in new ones, so he purchased

Pembroke Bows to W&L

By PALMER TRICE

In their last encounter in January,
the Generals faced the visiting squad
from Pembroke State. The Blue con-
tiued their Doremus streak, notching
a 64-56 victory. The win raised the
basketball team's record to 10-4, a
mark waich they carried imto the
game with U.Va. (See story, Page 1.)

At the outset of the Pembroke
game, the play of the two clubs was
sharp. When Pembroke slowly began
to pull away, they began to protect
their lead, by holding the ball. Down

from the floor, but hit 24 of 39
foul shots. While Pembroke shot a
better percentage than W&L, they
took 16 less foul attempts than
W&L, and made eight less. For the
firstt ime this year, one could hear
the Washington and Lee Swing. Play-
ing at home was, perhaps, the key
to the victory. The crowd support
was most vocal, perhaps causing a
few of the opposition's 19 turnovers.

Defensively, W&L used a match-
up, a half-court zone press, and a
three-quarter court press, the last
two in a successful attempt to upset
the tempo of the Pembroke offense.

The only sour note of the game
ocourred when big Paul McLure
fouled out late in the game. At the
time, he had contributed 10  re-
bounds.

But when the shouts had died and
the W&L Swing faded, it was a
happy Canfield team which trotted
off the court with a 64-56 win. They
knew they deserved it.

This evening the Generals return
home to Doremus following last
night's jaunt to Charlottesville. Tra-
ditional foe Hampden-Sydney will
serve as the opposition as Washing-
ton and Lee seeks to add to its
budding home court winning skein.

play against Randolph-Miacon on
Sacurday, March 20. The contest is
one cf six home games currently on
iad for the team.

Coach Dick Slaza’s squad, which
returns All-America selection Whit-
ney Morrill and Bill Brumback,
team scoring leader Sam Englehart
and a hosi of lettermen, engages
several touring teams during the
course of the season.

On March 22, the Blue will play
host to a selected group of All-Stars
representing English colleges. Later
that week, Darimouth, an Ivy
League team, will visit Lexington.

The Minks will engage in an ex-

lhe heroes of “No Substitute For

fought in Vietnam. Their staunchest
supporter is the filim’s John
Wayne. Whether expressing his love
for “this great nation of ours” o1
his anger at “the Commun.st Con

Bill Mollhany, a

Lexington T.R.A.I.N. Comm:ttee,
Wiich is sponsoring the showing,
said: “For a t:me, it seemed preity
lonely advocating victory against the
Communists. Propagandists in this
country somehow had convinced
many Americans that this war was
different, that victory was impossible
or undesirable, that some sort of un-
easy truce or shameful accommoda
tion was the only solution. We are
proud anl appy to be able to call
John Wayne and all these other
famous Americans our allies. We
certainly agree that in war, there is
no substitute for vietory!”

The T.R.A.L.N,. Committee, which
is part of a nationwide network spon-
sored and guided by The John Birch

Amerioan fighting men, to imeorease

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

(Continued from Page 2)
Training “leads to an animoalisiic,
mob response. It is a powerful form
of Pavlovian conditioning—condi-
tioning by which sexual and emo-
tional types of response can be sub-
stauted for intellectual considera-
tion.”

Dr. Michael J. Singer, a Long
Beach, California, psychiatrist, says:
“There is danger of serious psycho-
logical damage rather than benefit
from this type of group... meet-
ings, particularly if an emotionally
disturbed person in this group is
not being treated by a fully qualified
and trained psychotherapist.” One
might doubt the ability of ministers
or social workers or students to spot
this type of troubled individual be-
fore further damage is done, in view
of what Dr. Ross Sydner, Professor
of Religious Education and Pastoral
Psychology at Chicago Theological

Seminary, has said: “There are great
dangers that can be done by people
who do noi know what they are
doing. You get things roused up
that you might not have the know!l-
edge to really cope with. It is clear
that nobody, including the psychia-
trist, knows how to work with teen-
You may tear a teen-ager
wpart w.thout knowing that you are
do.ng it.” It seems that once-nonmal
adults can also be terribly upset by
this process! and the following quote
is from an article in the Wall Street
Journal for July 14, 1969: “One
executive, who went to Esalen on
his own hook, became so deeply
effected by the experience that he
quit his job. For a while he worked
as a dishwasher at Esalen .. . Now,
and then, a participant in Sensiti-
vicy Training wil crack under the
barrage of personal criticism and
analysis. One big company in the

agers.

Midwest stopped all Sensitivity
Iraining after a vice-president suf-
ferred a total breakdown during a
session and had to enter a mental
hospital. Fear of damage to the
mental health of employees has
taken ovher finms out of Sensitivity
Draining.”

Helping to bear all of this out
are the typical examples provided
by parents in Evanston, Llinois, con-
cerning the all-too-common results
of Sensitivity. One mother said her
daughter became hysterical. Others
said their teenagers were unable to
sleep. One boy reported that, after
an evening stint of blanket-crawling
and bred-passing, he found himself
on a street several blocks from his
heuse at 3 A.M. with no recollection
of even getting out of bed. Perhaps
you can understand now why promi-
nont psycholog'sis, like Dr. Everett
L. Shostrom, warn: “Never partici-
pate in a group encounter with close
associates. Never participate in a
group that lacks formal connection

with a {professional (doctor) on
whom you can check.”

It is interesting that the same
“sensiivily training” methods have

been used in such places as Nazi
Germany and Communist China in
order to guarantee obedience to
those respective Establishments. (On
this see: Dr. J.A.M. Merloo, “The
Rape of the Mind,” N.Y.: Grosset
and Dunlap, 1956; and the chapter
on criticism and self-criticism in Mao
Tse-tung’s “Quotations,” just to name
a couple.) It gets even more interest-
img when we see the Rockefeller
and Ford Foundations financing
N.T.L., Esalen and private sensi-
tivity programs, along with generous
help from Nixon's H.E.W. Depart-
ment and the O.E.O. It's hard to
get unconstitutional crime laws pass-
ed unless enough chaos, orime and
animalistic behavior is going on.

What do the brain benders have
in mind for the future? In August,
1967, Dr. Stanley Less told the
International Congress of Psychiatry
alized and anyone who tries to be
that society will become deperson-
an individual “will be looked upon
as odd, reactionray and antigroup.”
According to the Professor, “un-
animity of thinking would be seen
as the normal pattern.” Sensitivity
Training is an important part of
this scheme. Don't let them steal
your mental independence.

members at the rate of 32 per year
if he is to match the record of his
predecessor, Dean Pusey. Watt fore-
shaowed no changes in the hiring-
firing policy and noted that in the
future the time-honored practice of
fade-away contracts would serve in
the stead of outright dismissal.

“I have no ideas for any radical
change,” he said, “although if any-
thing is indicated by my experience
as Associate Dean, chianges will oc-
cur, My prime responsibility is to
make the changes we have work.”

An important task of the new
Dean will be his participation on
the University Council. The Council,
consisting of 12 students, 12 faculty,
and 4 dears will have final authority
on student affairs not regulated by
the yet-to-be-organized Student
Senate and will serve as a forum for
student grievances. Watt said he
thought the Council ‘would be quite
useful in broadening the understand-
ing of the University’s problems
among students.”

An understanding of the ROTC
issue will most likely be first on the
agenda when the Council meets.

Having titular responsibility for
maintaining academic standards, the
Dean of the College will have an
important voice in the debate over
credit for the ROTC department,
and, should a de-credited ROTC
establishment announce a unilateral
withdrawal as it did at the Uni-
versity of Virginia, the new Dean
may face his first baptism by fire.

Flurry Of Cold Checks

times many of the merchants even
try to hold checks for a while, in
hopes that the students will come
by and settle up on their own. But
a business like, say, the CO-OP
sometimes is down $300 in bad
checks in a period of one or two
weeks.”

Even though many students in-
stinctively resent a university com-
mittee “prying” invo their financial
affairs, the juo‘‘fication of the com-
mittee’s actions is obvious. Hope-
fully studen‘s can make an effort to
remember that the carelessness of a
minority does indeed jeopardize their
freedom to cash checks and to main-
tain accounis.

On Courses

By BRUCE P, MADISON

Student Representative on Courses
and Degrees Committee

The Courses and Degrees Com-
mittee had been a faculty committee
dealing with academic affairs until
earlier this year. At that time a
student position was created on the
committee. It was my privilege to
be selected by the Executive Com-
mittee to serve in this position.
While the committee still is, to a
cenain degree, under the jurisdic
tion of the faculty, | was granted
full voting privileges. It was deem-
ed inyportant that a committee deal-
ing almost entirely in student affairs
should have a full student member.

According to Dean Pusey, the
primary philosophy of the commét-
tee is that it serves as a body to
which students can petition con-
cerning requests they might have in
academic affairs. The two major
areas of these requests are for
clarification of items covered in
the “Washington and Lee University
Bulletin” and for exceptions to
faculty rules. Another major area of
Courses and Degrees Committee
business is concerned with recom-
mendations to the faculty on sug-
gesied new and revised courses.
These recommendations are later
voted on by the faculty.

This last category of responsi-
bility may seem a direct parallel to
the Faculty Ourriculum Committee.
This committee is an ad hoc com-
mittee created by the faculty for
investigation into new areas of cur-
riculum. Thus, while there is some
overlapping, Dean Pusey notes that
this is the case in many areas of
University government.

Ihe committee meets every Tues-
day. Other members of the body
besides Dean Pusey and myself are
Dean Atwood, Dr. W. Barrett, Dr.
Coulling, Dr. Griffith, Col. Head,
who serves as the secretary, Dr.
Hinton, Dr. Jenks, and Dr. Wise.

Typical requests are from students
requesting an overload or under-
load of hours during a semester. All
independemt majors are required to
have the course selections approved
iby the committee. Of specific con-
cern in the past several weeks has
been the approval of new Honors
Programs in the various depart-
ments. The faculty drew up the gen-
eral guidelines and directed the
Courses and Degrees Committee to
examine and approve the specifics.

In the initial discussion concern-
ing plans for the upcoming Consti-
tutional Convention, Glenn Azuma
suggested that the EC reconsider its
previous action of appointing itself
as ex Officio delegates. Sophomore
representative Tom Mays agreed,
saying that there was a considerable
student feedback concerning the
propriety of the EC “voting our-
selves into office.”

Student Body President Fran
Lawrence objected, pointing out that
there would be 38 other delegates
chosen by petition last week, suffici-
em numbers to “broaden the base
of representation to the convention.”

Vice President Phil Thompson
underscored Lawrence’s contention:
“I think it would be a mistake not to
include the EC ... it would, in
fact, be almost irresponsible for BC
members not to express their views
on such an important matter.”

In the second major order of
business, Baseball Coach Joseph
Lyles, representing the team cap-
tain, presented a request for funds
to defray the cost of air transporta-
tion for 20-22 ballplayers for the

Law Dean

One of the most important long-
range answers to the problems of
alienation, violence, and crime in
America involves educating the na-
tion's children to the inherently
positive values and iprocesses of the
governmental structure, according
to the final report of a Presidential
task force, headed by Washington
and Lee’s law dean, Prof. Roy L.
Steinheimer.

“If our children are provided suf-
ficiemt education and appropriate
democratic models in the home,
school, and communiy, as well as
an Opportunity to participate di-
rectly in democratic processes,” the
report contends, “they will want to
preserve our basic Constitutional
democracy as adults, (realizing) that
rational and orderly processes can
result in needed reforms.”

The report, completed this month,
is a refinement of an carly draft
presented in Decenvber before the
White House Conference on Chil-
dren. President Nixon had named

Will Perform

In New York Next Week

The Troubadour Theatre, has ac-
cepted an invitation to present its
current production “off-off” Broad-
way this month.

The Troubs will perform “Rosen-
crantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,”
the 1967 Tom Stoppard comedy, at
the Masterworks Laboratory Thea-
tre, East Second Street, Wednesday
through Friday evenings (Feb. 17-
19),

About 25 Trowbs will make the
trip, accompanied by Mrs. Ellen
Barnes, instructor in drama and di-
rector of the group.

The unique invitation to the
Froubadours was extended by Rich-
ard Moss, executive producer of the
theatre. Fred Cook, production man-
ager for Masterworks, had spent a
week last month working with the

Troubadours on “Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern,” and Mr. Moss said
Cook returned to New York with
“infectious enthusiasm” about the
Troub production.

The Executive Committee gave
the Troubadours $200 to help them
defray the cost of their trip to New
York, but the Troubs still need more
money in order to make their trip
a success. The organization requests
that all those interested in making
any contribution please contact the
theatre.

The Troubs will present “Rosen-
crantz and Guildenstern” in Lexing-
ton Feb. 9 through 13, just prior
to leaving for New York. They will

amining approaches to legal educa-
tion involving the nation’s young
children.

The 15 member committee noted
that the nation as a whole has
“failed to show children that the
democratic processes inherent in the
American Constitutional system can
help solve today’s most vital prob-
lems.”

“lf we do not demonstrate to
children that we can work within
(the system) to effect needed reforms
for all citizens, then we cannot ex-
pect children to make the necessary
commitment to the democratic prin-
ciples and ideals which support our
system.”

The Steinheimer committee's final
report pointed to research findings
that indicate children are able from
very early ages to understand the
meanings of “Law,” “justice,” and
“rules.” By the time they begin to
be taught formally about legal and
political order, they have long been
judging it.

The challenge, according to the
tusk force report, is to begin at much

 

earlier ages in children’s lives to pro-
vide them with appropriate prin-
ciples by which to make those judg-
ments,

Most young children, the report
continues, see rules in school, family
life, and similar local situations as
generally preventing disorder and
protecting social interaction—not as
punitive or coercive.

A systematized, comprehensive
design for providing small children
with practical experience in demo-
cratic situations and with a personal
understanding of the value of demo-
cracy must be applied to children
from the earliest ages, the report
conchides.

Mhat, it states, is the only effective
way the nation’s young people can
develop an appreciation of the bal-
ance between independence and abli-
gation and learn to value the con-
cepts of fair play and justice.

Members of Dean Steinheimer's
committee included psychologists,

forcement officials as well as others

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

And Now... Part 3 Of
Captain Lexington And His
Astonishing Money-Making Machine

It certainly isn't exactly refreshing to see one of Lexing-
ton’s own residents dreaming up ways to tax Washington and
Lee University. It might not be so bad if Mr. Charles W. Gunn,
Jr. was a representative in the Virginia House of Delegates
from another city, but the fact that he is a lawyer here in town
and a representative to the House strikes us as ironic,

This time the “Town vs. Gown” serial has taken a remark-
able twist in plot. Before the Virginia House of Delegates is a
bill presented by Mr. Gunn which would give Virginia counties
and municipalities the right to tax dwellings which are owned
by non-profit organizations, Aha! Washington and Lee Uni-
versity in Lexington, Virginia is a non-profit organization
which owns certain dwellings. Conclusion? If the law passes
and Governor Holton signs it, Lexington, Virginia can tax
Washington and Lee University if it so chooses, Here, the
plot falls apart and the exciting climax is known by all. Lex-
ington will choose to tax W&L and installment number 3 is
over.

We have no way of knowing whether Mr, Gunn is aware
that Washington and Lee has enough monetary problems
without having to worry about paying a tax on its faculty
housing to the city of Lexington. We also don't know whether
Mr. Gunn is cognizant of the facts surrounding the controversy
over the tag tax on students’ cars which went into effect this
fall. But we do know that if Washington and Lee University
was built on casters, we'd be the first to push it somewhere else
in the Valley.

Much of the economic life of this city is sustained by the
simple fact that W&L is here. Washington and Lee provides
jobs for the people of this area as well as money for local mer-
chants. At worst, the city would be much less than it is with-
out W&L and VMI to support it. But this is almost a fait
accompli. Instead of an attempt at making the monetary exis-
tence of the students and the University convenient, it seems
that the city has done its best to make it as unpalatable as pos-
sible as the year has progressed. We're aware that the city
needs money, but are they aware that W&L needs every cent
it can get? Judging from the actions which have been taken
and which are impending in the House, we don’t think so,

We ask that if this bill is passed by the Virginia legislature,
Governor Holton, you will consider the plight of this Univer-
sity as well as others around this state. Private institutions of
higher learning in Virginia and about the country are not ex-
actly in clover as they enter the 1970's. Washington and Lee
does not need another expense to add to the debit side of their
hooks—especially when money is tight and its plans for devel
opment have just begun.

In the meantime, we ask the students of Washington and
Lee to write Mr. Charles W. Gunn, Jr. and attempt to explain
to him that we don't need any more taxes. And the next time
you buy anything here in town, listen to how the merchant
says, “Thank you,”

A Suggestion For The Student Union

Did you know that W&L’s Student Union does not have
an educational television hookup? The conception of the Stu-
dent Union was that it provide areas for recreation, congrega
tion, study, education, and entertainment. The building has
certainly served its purpose on all counts, except the educa
tional one

Educational television provides what we consider the only
valuable television viewing because it brings informative and
the
enough, Washington and Lee doesn't have an antenna which

cultural events into view of everyone. Yet, strangely
would give clear reception for all educational television pro
yrains

We hope that in the budget for the Student Union next
vear there will be an allocation for the purchase of this special
antenna, Without educational television in the Student Union
the value of the building itself seems to be more oriented to

wards recreation than education

Law School: Out In The Cold

By SKIP PAUKERT

“There just doesn't seem to be
any effort to communicate .. .”"—so
said one senior law student in identi-
fying what he believes to be a seri-
ous problem at W&L, namely the
matter of a working rapport, or
lack thereof, between the under-
graduate and the law — schools.
Enough of his fellow students share
his viewpoint to warrant an exami-
nation of the  relationship—eco-
nomic, academic, political, and soc-
ial—between the Law School and
the university as a whole, and what
it will mean for the future students
of both groups.

The School of Law has been an
official segment of W&L since 1870,
and became a member of the As-
sociation of American Law Schools
in 1920. It has always ‘been highly
respected and has been able to boast
of five alumni who have served as
President of the American Bar As-
sociation, a record exceeded by only
two other law schools.

“Our goal is excellence as an aca-
demic institution,” remarked Roy L.
Steinheimer, Dean of the School of
Law. “And there is no doubt that
Law school students should be able
to interchange their ideas with other
students in the university.”

Steinheimer pointed out that with-
in the Law School itself, there re-
mains a certain degree of autonomy
and self-government. Members of
the Law faculty sit on their own
committees within the school—Our-
riculum, Admissions, Academic
standards, Library, ets.—which cor-
respond to similar committees in the
undergraduate sector. The Law
School is also often represented on
other general faculty committees,
such as the faculty EC and the Ad-
missions Committee.

Steinheimer added that there
seemed to be no partition between
members of the law and undergradu-
ate faculties. “During the day we
have coffee together at the Alumni
house or at the Co-op; on a more
academic level, there is quite a

flux of aw professors invited to
undergraduate classes to talk, and
vice versa. We even have had under-
graduate instructors and professors

sitting in on our Roman Law
course,”
As to an exchange of actual

courses between the law school and
other departments, the difficulty

stems largely from the staff limiita-
tions and the large number of law

 

sociology, and economics.”

Some students have complained
that there should be greater contact
between the law and undergraduate
students in the area of student activi-
ties—government, speaker programs,
seminars, and the like. The question
then follows: who is responsible for
the present indifference, the under-
graduates or the law students?

“Part of the problem is the gen-

students presently enrolled. John
Markham, a junior law student and
past representative to the EC, hopes
for improvements in this area in the
future: “Academically, there seems
to be a lot that is not done that
should be done in terms of an inter-
change. Law is an embodiement of
the social sciences, and, therefore,
there could be academic bridges
with, say, courses in psychology,

eration gap, offered Gene Wollard,
a senior law student who has served
on the Honor Court and as secre-
tary-treasurer of the Legal Aid and
Research Association. “I would like
to see the undergraduates take more
initiative to include the law school
in the campus life.”

“Last spring several students came
to us for legal advice on how to go
about their activities during the mor-

the undergraduates see us at the
other end of the Colonnade as some
symbol of the Establishment. But
some of us are more concerned about
world problems and student issues

and we want to help.”

Markham, however, saw a large
part of the responsibility to rest with
the law students. “If we could get

draft counseling, tenant rights, and
co-education, the rest of the uni-
versity would probably, to a large
degree, follow suit.”

Troubs’ Fare:
Professional a

By STEVE HAUGHNEY

There’s a troupe of wandering
actors come to town this week to
put on a play, and if you want to
experience theatre of professional
quality, 1 urge you to see their per-
formance. Washington and Lee's
own Troubadours have brought their

production of “Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead” back to
Lexington after a week on tour

around Virginia, a week during
which they have honed a good pro-
duction into an excellent one.

The play presents the spectacle of
two minor characters from Shake-
speare’s “Hamlet” trying to compre-
hend their roles in the Elsinore
drama, attempting to play their parts
to the best of their limited ability.
Walkie May and Lawrence McCon-
nell give superb interpretations of a
foppish Rosencrantz and an absurd
Guildenstern and turn a very funny
script into a hilarious stage per-
formance.

Walkie May, who was a standout
in a minor part in the Troubs’ first
production of the year, “Billy Budd, ’
accepts the much more demanding
role of Rosencrantz with great ease
and skill, giving a flawless perform-
ance. Lawrence McConnell, who has
been a leading Trouwb actor since
his freshman year, makes his Guil-
denstern the best performance of
his Washington and Lee career.

The supporting cast is also out-
standing. Richard Pilkinton, as the
Player who leads the motley band
of tragedians who perform at Elsi-
nore, is at once disarming and
menacing, while Beach Vickers gives
us a humorous, hapless Alfred. All
of those in the smaller roles do
excellent jobs, particularly Cal
Whitehurst as Gertrude and Stephen
Lester as the tottering Polonius.

Phe technical crews hive up to
their past standard of excellence
lhe brilliant lighting gives the stage
a quality of barrenness which sets
off sharply the outrageously color-
ful costumes of Rosencraniz and
Guildenstern, accentuating the im-
pression of their alienation and isola-
tion. O. K. Barnes’ set is inten-
tionally anonymous: it could be any-
where, for the pathetic antics of
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern can-
not be confined to Elsinore or to a
ship on its way to England, but are
alarmingly similar to our own,

Special recognition is due to Di-
rector Ellen Barnes, who takes Tom
Stoppard’s script as published and
makes it her own. She has done a
very effective job with the scissors.
cutting out lines and even whole
scenes that don't suit her image of
the play. The result is a script that
is terse and fast-paced, with none of
the diffuseness or volubility that
tends to mar Stoppard’s original
version. The foous of the play is
still the same—the absurd situation
of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
but Mrs. Barnes’ cuts have made it
more direct and, as a consequence
I think. more penetrating for the
audience

She has done more to the script
than cut #, however, in what |
hink is a successful attempt to un
derscore the absurdity of the two
leading characters. The script calls
for Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

By MACK WOODWARD

A boy I know is on drugs. He’s
not a close friend, maybe not even
a friend. If I'd known him better,
maybe I could have done something,
but I doubt it. How he got on drugs
1 don’t know, other than he started
out on marijuana, and has graduated
to the big time: LSD, mescaline,
et al. The more I think about it, the
less sense drugs make.

Of course a discussion of drugs is
rather futile today; warnings seem to
fall on deaf ears, and many who are
opposed to drugs read anti-drug
opinions and tell each other, “I told
you so.” (Maybe I’m one of them).
Fighting futility as well as drugs,
I sally forth to beat the perhaps
unbeatable foe.

I have heard two basic “reasons”
conjured up to explain drug use,
escapism and hedonism. One might
here deliver a five column inch
harangue against hedonism or escap-
ism, but one would be ignoring
another more immediate “reason”
that drugs have become so popular.
Drugs are glamorous.

The glamor of drugs is the
really amazing aspect of the whole
problem. Ten years ago, drugs were
regarded as a problem of the ghettos.
The dope peddier in those junior
high school films was really nasty

Zetlin Art Exhibit

“The Exploration of Space” is the
theme of a new art exhibit by Fay
Zetlin, professor of art at Old
Dominion College, which will open
Feb. 15 at the duPont Art Gallery.

Mrs. Zetlin uses abstract painting
forms to capture the illusion and
feel of space in her works, accord-
ing to W&L art professor Dr.

and spoke almost  uninteliigible
English.

But now the most stylish parties
feature a few puffs of pot. (Isn't
social democratization wonderful?)

One wonders about this almost
overnight blooming of the drugs cul-
ture. One wonders about the atmos-
phere that is conducive to the bloom-
ing of such a culture. The best
answer I can find is that the existing
oulture is, indeed, hedonistic and
escapist. And we have made full
circle.

But I refuse—naively and opti-
mistically perhaps—to believe that
people are so weak that they must
seek such an addictive escape as
drugs are. Drugs are a pessimistic
answer to any question; they are the
beginning of an almost never-end-
ing cycle. The human mind is cap-
able of resolving more problems and
making more decisions than most
realize; it really doesn’t need to be
expanded any further than it is to
function properly.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

By JEFFREY SPENCE

In just a matter of days the Con-
stitutional Convention for W&L will
convene. This meeting of students
has ‘been proposed iby the Executive
Committee for the purpose of revis-
ing student government on our
campus.

Unfortunately, not only has it been
proposed by the E.C. but it will be
regulated and conducted under their
auspices. Futhermore the E.C. will
'be seated as a block of twelve regu-
lar voting delegates.

If one were to read the plans for
this convention, they might easily
come to the conclusion that this
meeting will be nothing more than
a rubber stamp for whatever the
E.C, desires in a new constitution.
The pat argument that denies this is
the E.C, will be only 12 of 47
delegates and thus not even a
quorum for discussion.

This argument shows up hollow
when you realize that after the con-
vention ends the E.C. has to vote

Leach Reviews Library Situation

Unprecedented growth and inno-
vation highlighted the operations of
Washington and Lee’s library system
in the 1969-70 academic year, ac-
cording to the report released by
head librarian Maurice Leach last
week.

Spending for books, periodicals,
and supplies was more than double
the level of the previous year, $136,-
886 in the latest year, up from
$62,346 the year before.

At year's end, the main library

and the six undergraduate depart-
mental libraries ‘held 225,263 vol-
umes, an increase of more than
12,000 volumes.

Counting governmental doouments
on deposit in the library system, and
other miscellaneous materials, the
undergraduate library system now
includes more than 300,000 holdings.

The university's law library, ad-
ministered separately, contains an
additional 50,000 holdings. The
undergraduate system includes Cyrus
Hall McCormick Library and speci-
alized libraries in the departments of
journalism, biology, chemistry,
geology, physics, and in the Schoo!
of Commerce, Economics and Poli-
tics.

The total library budget was $251,-
688, almost double the previous
year’s total of $136,200. The former
figure represented 5.2 per cent of
the University’s overall ‘budget,
marking the first time that the Li-
brary has surpassed the American
Library Association's minimum, (5
per cent) in many years,

In terms of accessibility to books,
which, along with the collection of
materials is a fundamental goal of
the library whe report is less opti-
mistic. A drop of 16 per cen in
the circulation of materials was
noted, and due at least in part to
needs in other areas, profession re-
ference services were down from 65
to 44 hours per week. Acquisition
of new titles, however, was up a
striking 89 percent over the previ-
ous year,

Inter-library activity with neigh-
boring Virginia Military Institute
was continued, and the possibility of
other cooperative ventures, possibly
with the other members of the 7
College Exchange Program, were al-
so pursued.

Projected plans for the new bibrary
were also discussed in committee
meetings and through a series of
faculty visits throughout the country

during the summer of 1970.

The long-standing efficiency of
Washington and Lee’s Honor System
was noted in an inventory, covering
a 21 year span, that showed only
| percent of the present holding to
be missing. There was, however, last
spring, a “considerable increase” in
the losses of reference materials and
periodicals.

In evaluating the report, Leach
stressed the support of the Uni-
versity community, and the “loyalty
and ingenuity of the library staff.”
As a major goal for the future, he
cited the expansion of reference ca-
pabilities and the growth of profes-
sional reference aid, notably during
weekends.

The librarian also stressed the role

of students in governing their library,
not only through the activities of
the Student Library Committee, but
also through suggestions and com-
plaints by individual students. “Any
member of the library staff will be
pleased to assist students.” Leach
added. “My door is always open.”

Leach also recommended, in addi-
tion to “direct” criticism, the use of
the suggestion boxes situated
throughout the ‘building for those
who wish to make anonymous com-
plaints.

Copies of the library report will
be made available to students at
the main desk. Any member of the
student body who encounters diffi-
culty in obtaining one should see a
menrber of the staff.

Old-Time Jazz At VMI

The Rockbridge Concert-Theatre
Series will present as its third con-
cert this season the Preservation Hall
Jazz Band on Thursday, Feb. 18,
in Jackson Hall at VMI. The concert
will begin at 8:15 p.m.

Preservation Hall, in the French
Quarter of New Orleans, is the home
cf the old jazz musicians whose vital
folk art is now seldom heard.

Originating as funeral-march brass
bands and as background for the
shows of the Storyville era of the
the wurn of the century, this jazz
differs from Dixieland in that it is
more improvisational and more spon-
taneous. The musicians are in the
tradition of Bessie Smith, Jelly Roll
Morton, and Leadbelly.

on anything that is proposed. If they
find something they don’t like they
can in effect kill it for all time.

This is how it works. The conven-
tion \proposals are voted on by the
Executive Committee. If any or all
the proposals pass then they are
submitted to the student body for
nacification. To pass the student body
it would take only a majority vote.
However, if the E.C. rejects any
proposals of the convention then it
would take a voting turn out of
two-thirds of the student body and
a two-thirds vote of them to over-
ride the E.C.'s veto.

The idea of this convention is a
good one. What is unfortunate about
it is that all the cards are stacked
in favor of the Executive Commit-
tee and its desires. Let us hope that
those people who are to be seated
as delegates from the university will
not allow themselves to be intimi-
dated by the awesome power-elite
that is the Executive Committee.

Students of W&L are allowed to
go to the convention although they
may not directly speak to the floor.
Lobbying is an old American tradi-
tion; use it. You may not ‘be allow-
ed to speak directly to the conven-
tion ‘but that does not prevent you
from speaking to the delegates on
a one to one basis.

Of course, the final power of
change rests with the vote of each
individual student. If you care about
your school and you think that your
‘beliefs have gone unsatisfied, then
get out and vote. A guarantee of a
two-thirds turn out is a power to
be reckoned with by the Executive
Committee,

Cavaliers Dominate,
Generals Fall 92-70

But W@L Wins Two;
Sinks Hampden-Sydney;
Totals Emory @ Henry

By PALMER TRICE

“They never quit.” This was the
comment made by Coach Corrigan,
after his team’s trouncing of our
Generals. A surprisingly large parti-
san crowd watched the Cavaliers
capture a 92-70 victory over the
visitors. Coach Canfield was disap-
pointed in a way, but he felt that
his squad learned from the en-
counter,

Except for a short-lived 4-3 lead,
the Blue trailed for the remainder
of the ball game. U.Va. started
quickly, with Barry Parkhill garner-
ing their first seven points. The height
advantage that the Cavalier enjoyed,
plus a quick trapping defense proved
more than enough to undo the
visitors,

Washington and Lee turned the
ball over 24 times, as compared to
18 by U.Va. However, the Generals
press was effective in spurts. After
the game, Coach Canfield noted that
“we can gress anybody.”

Offensively, the Blue were led by
Mike Daniel's 20 points, several of
which were gotten on layups behind
the Virginia defense. Ellie Gutshall
had 6 assists. Coming off the bench,
Skip Lichtfuss grabbed 8 rebounds,
and had nine points. John Dumas
had six big rebounds, and proved
more than adequate in his reserve
role. However, the Generals shot 10
percent poorer than the Cavaliers
from the field, making seven less
shots.

The following night, Wednesday,
the Generals returned to Doremus to
face the visiting Tigers of Hampden-
Sydney. In their first meeting, the
Tigers had nipped the Generals at
Death Valley. The Blue were a tired
bunch, both mentally and physically,
after playing their hardest the night
before at University Hall.

In a nip and tuck ball game, the
Generals managed to slip by the
Tigers by a score of 78-74. The
tigers overcame a One point half-

and held the lead until the two
minute mark. After grabbing the
lead on a basket by John Dumas,
the Generals went into a type of
four corners offense. The visitors
were forced to foul, and ithe shots
were converted by Doug Clelan.
Bruce King made the first of his
attempts, missed the second, but ‘the

no time left, Doug Clelan converted
two more, to put the icing on the

It is interesting to note that the

field, is the winningest coach in all of
WA&L’s 62 years of roundball history.
‘Up to this moment, his record stands
at 98-61 and two wins out of the
remaining six scheduled games would

If one is interested in broken

counter.

THE RING-TUM PHI

0 THE EO

OR

On R.O.T.C. Crisis

To the editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

I believe the debate on the ROTC
issue has been sufficient for the aver-
age reader to come to some kind
of decision on where he stands.
However, your editorial compels me
to try to clarify my position.

First of all, I have enough prob-
lems without your paper announc-
ing to my \professors what courses |
do and do not like. If, after all,
you think I support the abolition of
ROTC credit merely because I do
not like the courses, which I did
not say, then I ‘begin to despair over
men’s complete imability to com-
municate with one another, Unless
I state then, 1 do not think it is fair
for yo uto create my motivation.

Secondly, we are not discussing
whether there are other courses on
campus unworthy of credit. The fact
that such courses exist in no way
enhances the value of ROTC. There
are certain activities which this
school just doesn’t give oredit for.
Among these are rugby, typing, au‘o
mechanics and driver's educa‘ion.
From my point of view, ROTC
comes closer to these than its does
to a course like the Social and In-
tellectual History of the United
States. Perhaps I have misunderstood
your editorials, but I think you have
stil not attempted to show why
ROTC should not be included in the
former group of activities rather
than the latter.

As I noted in my first letter, there
are courses such as Military History,
which do have academic value. But
the bulk of them do not. Half of the
material we covered in Map Reading
| had already learned as a 12-year-
old in Boy Scouts. I don't think this
University (or any high school, for
that matter) should offer even part-
ial credit for such a course. And, as

for drill, which ts about 20 per cent
of our grade, what is the academic
value of a properly executed right
face?

Thirdly, I did not say ROTC made
one’s course load lighter, or that it
helped raise GPR’s (although with
my A I'm still only 18 in a class of
38). These were reasoms given to
me by other cadets for wanting to
retain credit. I have yet to hear any-
one currently taking ROTC support
granting the credits to the course for
any academic reason. Apparently,
such a reason is far from the minds
of those taking the course.

I am not, as you imply, favoring
the removal of ROTC from the
campus, merely the credit. If the boss
of two hours of credit is enough to
cause a mass exodus from the pro-
gram, I frankly don’t see why the
Army would be interested in officers
with such poor motivation.

I am also aware that the Army
gives scholarships, since I ‘have a
four-year scholarship myself (the last
I heard). The Army recognizes that
a college career is a good back-
ground for the officer; ROTC is their
“filler” material in which they im-
part certain vocational knowledge as
squad formation, etc. But, with the
exceptions I already mentioned, the
hill is where you think, the ravine
is Where you do other things. ROTC
is essential training, but it is not
academic,

I imagine we still disagree, but |
heige that by now you understand
that my motivation (if you must
question it) is my concern for aca-
demic standards, and not my mytho-
logical dislike for a course.

Everett Newman

Reply To Gingold

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

This letter would be more ap-
propriately addressed to Mr. Jeff
Gingold, since its contents are in
direct reply to his calm, considered,
logically perfect, and persuasive let-
ter,

First of all, Mr. Gingold, I'd like
to clear up a few things in your
mind about news reporting, editorial
opinion, commentaries, and the re-
lationship between a newspaper edi-

tor and his palper, When a man
writes an editorial, he puts down
his Opinion as based on a logical
consideration of objective facts.
These facts are as available to him
as they are to the holders of the
Opposing opinions, If the opposition
has select access to certain valuable
facts, it is their duty (if they are
really interested in rational argu-
ment) to reveal those new eanrth-
shaking facts in those argument.
Hence, the editor of this paper has
not ‘been writing on the ROTC
question out of ignorance or close-
mindedness; rather, he has been writ-
ing about the facts the way he sees
them. What you really mean, Mr.
Gingold, when you say that he
“didn’t get the facts from both
sides,” is that he didn’t get his
Opinion from both sides. Instead
he did some god-awful independent
thinking. Now then, Mr. Gingold,
you were correct when you said
that the Ring-tum Phi is Lawrence
McConnell’s paper, since he is the
editor, However, you make a basic
error. For some reason, you fail to
realize that the opinion of the
paper is the opinion of the editor,
and vice versa. When the editor
writes an editorial, it is correct
journalistic form to say, “the opinion
of The Ring-tum Phi,” instead f
saying, “my opinion.” Mr. Gingold,
you compared the job Mr. McCon-
nell has done with the work of the
radio station. Alas, it seems your
contact with media functioning has
been quite limited. There is a dis-
tinction between an editorial in a
newspaper and a radio commentary,
At a very basic level, the former is
a brief argument in favor of a par-
ticular point of view while the latter
is a much longer and thorough
coverage of all the facts, all the
Opinions, and perhaps forms an
opinion in conclusion.

I must say that I think that Mr.
McConnell has been doing a good
job of running The Ring-tum Phi.
Every issue has contained numerous
articles expressing an opinion con-
trary to his own. However, since
you have displayed such an obvious
willingness to “listen to” another
man’s opinion on innumerable oc-
casions, (such as the Cockpit after
Dr. Toole’s Contact presentation) |

What you should know about diamonds
when you know it's for keeps

 

You've dreamed about your
diamond engagement ring a thou-
sand times. But now that you
know it's for keeps, it’s time to
stop dreaming and start learning
about diamonds and their value.

Because no two diamonds
are exactly alike, jewelers have
adopted exacting standards to de-
termine the relative value of each
and every diamond in the world.
These standards include a dia-
mond's size (carat weight), color,
cut and clari

 

COLOR: Fine white diamonds are
quite rare and valued accordingly.
Other shades in relative order of
their worth are: blue, yellow,
brown and black.

CUT: The cut of a diamond—the
facets placed on it by a trained
cutter—brings out the gem's fire
and brilliance. Anything less than
correct cut reduces beauty, bril-
liance and value

CLARITY: Determined by the ab-
sence of small impurities, A per-
fect diamond has no impurities
when examined under ten power
magnification by a trained eve

CARAT A diamond's siz is
measured in carats, As a diamond
increases in size, its price will
increase even more if the quality
remains constant, But larger dia-
monds of inferior quality may ac-
tually be worth less than emalier,
perfect diamonds

Law School: In The Cold

(Continued from Page 2)

Phil Thompson added: “Law stu-
dents are now, more and more, from
other undergraduate colleges; they
have no real appreciation for the
WAL ‘life style.’ There is really very
litthe common ground.”

There are plans for the School
of Law to eventually move out of

vorce,” said Thompson, “will most
likely make this isolation even more
pronounced.”

students, I would hope that the
students would become better ac-
quainted with this committee since
its primary purpose is to serve stu-
dents. If a student does have a
request he should submit his peti-

the College. In this petition he
should include all pertinent informa-
tion concerning his case and his rea-
sons for seeking his request. Each

an individual and fair basis. | would

ignorance in such matters as jour-
nalism that prompted your recent
letter. Lastly, I must express my awe
at your mental prowess, Mr. Gin-
gold. I know of few people with the
extra-sensory perception to know
that Mr. McConnell got his opinion
second or third hand.

Stephen C, Woodruff

So how serious this whole prob-
lem is seems to be a rather sub-
jective determination. “Having
graduated from the University of
Pennsylvania, which was a much

larger school,” commented Rob Hart-

mann, President of Student Bar As-
sociation, “I think we have a con-
siderably closer relationship here.”

Both Thompson and Markham
suggested that, should the law school
become a little more organized with-
in, interested law students would
be able to find the avenues to project
their efforts in university affairs.
Woolard maintained that under-
graduates should perhaps remember
to include the law students in their
campus activities and (programs by
increased publicity and considera-
tion of law schedules.

Dean Steinheimer, however, off-
ered an observation central to the
issue-at-hand: “The Law School will
remain an integral part of the uni-
versity, and it will be up to the
students to mold their own pattern
of university life and unity,”

EC Studies Poll

Lawrence referred the matter to
the financial committee, which was
charged with an examination of
how much money was currently
available in the budget. Lyles
promised to inquire with other pos-
sible sources also for aid on the
project.

The Honor System committee was
able to distill five main student gen-
ernal sentiments from the data re-
turned on the surveys: (1) that the
jurisdiction of the honor system be
effective only while school was in
session, (2) that teachers should be
more specific as to what homework
and/or testing should be pledged or
unpledged, (3) that an additional
stipulation allowing for a one-year
suspension be added to the absolute
penalty as an alternative sentence
for the EC in an honor case.

(4) That the EC should be allowed
some discretion on determining the
degree of the penalty with consid-
eration to the integrity of the stu-
dem, and (5) that a student found
guilty of a violation not be required
to be accompanied by two EC mem-
bers until his leaving the school.

Convention Adjourns;

Delegates Recommend | fe

Honor Court, Senate

A Student Senate and Honor
Court, which would replace the cur-
rent Executive Committee, have
been endorsed by the Constitutional
Convention held this last weekend.

The two proposed student bodies
would split the duties now held by
the EC. The Senate would be larger
in number than the Honor Court
and perform the legislative and ad-
ministrative roles of the EC. Sole
jurisdiction over the Honor System
falls in the hands of the proposed
Honor Court.

The great majority of the existing
Student Body Constituition remained
unchanged. Only wording changes
were recommended for several
articles of the Constitution. The
foremost changes involved Articles
IV-VIH, which dealt with student
government,

Under the amended Constitution
the Honor Court would have 12
members. The three Student Body
Officers, and nine justices elected
from respective classes make up this
total. The scheme of membership
closely parallels the current selection
policy of the EC.

According to the amended Consti-
tution, the Honor Court would “have
sole jurisdiction in the implimenta-
tion of the Honor System.” The
court would also superintend all Stu-
dent Body Elections and act as the
interpretting body for the Consti-
‘tution.

The Student Senate would handle
most of the student government
activities now undertaken by the EC.
The Senate would consist of 33
members; the Student Body Officers

Jazz Group
To Perform
Tomorrow

The third concert of the
bridge Concert-Theater Series will
present the Preservation Hall Jazz
Band on Thursday, February 18 in
Jackson Memorial Hall, VMI. The
concert will begin at 8:15 p.m.

Preservation Hall, in the French
Quarter of New Orleans, is the home
of the old jazz musicians whose
vital folk art is now seldom heard.

The band that will play in Lex
ington is known as the Billie and
Dede Pierce Band, named after the
two chief musicians, Billie Pierce
on piano and her husband, Dede, on
trumpet. Other musicians of | this
group are trombonist Jim Robinson,
clarinetist William Humphrey, and
Cie Frazer on the drums. These
performers are elderly, all at least
60 years old, bul many press notices
comment on the infectious spirit of
their enthusiasm, As Newsweek com
menteod on a Philharmonic Hall
concert last summer, the music is
“nrystically sweet, pure.”

would serve on this group as well
as the Honor Court. The reamain-
ing Senators would be elected from
their classes,

All legislative powers pertaining
to the Student Body would originate
in this body. The Senate would also
have responsibility for the Standing
Committees. All appointments to
special and University Committees
would require the approval of the
Senate.

The Senate and Honor Court
would be separate entities because
of a requirement for separate mem-
bership. However, the organizations
would have contact through the
Presidem, Vice-President, and Secre-
tary of the Student Body, who are
in both organizations.

Election procedures were asked to
be altered so that the Honor Court
members would be selected two
weeks before the Senate. It was
felt by the Convention that this
would place better justices on the
Court.

The University Council would be
included in the Constitution. Its

EC A

The Executive Committee Mon-
day evening unanimously endorsed
the proposed Student Body Constitu-
tion drawn up in convention last
week. The document must now face
a student referendum and a ma-
jority of the student body must vote
for its final approval.

In other action the EC relieved
somewhat their previous ban on
editorial comment to be published
in the University Center newsletter.
Signed articles will now be encourag-
ed to allow students a forum for a
“wider range” of opinion.

Phe members of the EC, who
served as ex officio delegates to the
convention, made only a few minor
changes in the new constitution’s
text, mainly for purposes of clari-
fication.

The EC rejected an amendment
concerning contrals over the Dance
Board, reasoning that further juris-
diction over the Board would be
unfair. It was anticipated that sub-
stamtial funding for concerts from
the university in the coming year
would be highly unlikely.

They also struck a provision for
the recall of officeholders, requir
ing only two-thirds of those voting
in the student body to remove an
officer. They opted instead for a
recall procedure that would compel
the signature of $0 percent of an
officer's constituency for removal

Several members of the EC ex
pressed reservations about the new
governmental framework, fearing
that inefliciency would result from

an expansion to a larger Senate and
Honor Court. “I think we have a
real possibility of a large and un
wieldy Senate, .. . as a product of
student indifference and apathy,” re-
marked Law representative John
Moore.

Staman Ogilvie contested Moore's
view, saying that the new structure
was a necessary “calculated gamble.”
“The best that can happen,” Ogilvie
continued, “is that with this many
representatives the students will feel
that their participation might have
some real influence.... There is a
better chance that they will know
someone personally.”

President Fran Lawrence, an ad
vocate of the change, emphasized
that the function of the honor system
would not be jeopardized. “The
Honor Court will most likely con-
sists of students much like
presently on the EC,” he stated
“There will probably be less cama-
radorie, more hostility, and more of
“a real interchange in the new

Joe Tompkins objected to the fact
that the power of constitutional in-

Honor Council, which he said would
lack a “working knowledge of the
application of the document.” Ogil-

many area institutions, the number
of applicants to Washington and Lee
is Staying relatively stable. One rea-
son for this is the efforts of the
Student Recruitment Committee.

efforts to help the Office of Admis-

about fifty high schools have been

On Circle K

By JOHN McCARDELL

Tonight is the deadline for sub-
mitting applications for membership
in the W&L Circle K club. Circle
K is the college division of Kiwanis
International, which also supervises
high school Key Clubs as well as
community Kiwanis clubs. I am very
grateful to the staff of the Phi for
the use of this space this week to
relate some of the activities of Circle
K on campus, and I hope that some
last-minute applications will be in-
spired. This is certainly a better
place to have one’s name found
than in some page-filled campus
gossip column, amusing though it
may be.

But we digress,

By its very nature, Circle K is
service-oriemed, toward the W&L
community, certainly, but in the
wider sense, to the entire Lexington
community as well. Working to-
gether with the Lexington Kiwanis
Club, Circle K undertakes several
community service projects each
year, which, in addition to the self-
satisfaction of working for a worth-
while and recognizable cause, fosters
better relations between students and

local business and civic leaders.
Based on the motto “We Build,”

Circle K has been active over the
last few years.

So, to enlighten those who have
heretofore been ignorant of our
work, as well as, I hope, to obtain
several last-minute application from
imterested students, a brief deserip-
tion of some of our activities might
at this time be in order.

First, with the non-existence of
any group, at least on an organized
basis, to work with the admissions
office in giving campus tours to
prospective freshmen, each member
of Circle K gave about an hour of
his time per week first term to fill
this need, and we have resumed this
serv ce for the second term as well.
A small, unnoticed service, perhaps,
but a constructive one. Over spring
vacation, as in past years, club mem-
bers will be expected to search out
qualified high school students in
their areas to encourage those who
have already been accepted to come,
and those who are at all interested
to apply.

Second, prior to first term exams
before Christmas, Circle K sponsor-
ed a raffle for the benefit of the

A Student Senate,

An Honor Council,
A Few Reasons Why

Now that the work of the Constitutional Convention is
over, and that work has received the Executive Committee
approval which, for reasons listed below, was pretty much
taken as a fait accompli, perhaps it is time to present to the
members of the student body here at Washington and Lee a
few reasons behind the actions taken at the convention, as
well as the reasons for a few omissions.

To begin, one might ask why the current Constitution had
to be changed at all. The answer to this question comes easily
to mind, and has to do with the self-evident power elite which
currently exist at the helm of student government.

That there is such an elite should be clear, that the exist-
ence of this elite tends to discourage people from seeking
positions in the government is perhaps more tenuous, but a
look at the several unopposed offices in last year’s EC elections
should serve to make this point a little more definite.

The thought of the convention was that, if more offices
were available, more candidates would be found willing to
present themselves to the electorate, since their chances of
winning have been increased considerably, simply by virtue
of the larger number of positions to be filled.

In line with this idea is the fact that Washington and Lee
is scarcely the relatively homogeneous body it was five or ten
years ago, and now there is a need to provide representation
for numerous constituencies to be found throughout the school.

The Student Senate, it is hoped, will provide that in-
creased representation. Certainly, this is how the Senate can
be utilized; it is up to us to make sure that this becomes
the case.

That it was thought necessary to separate the legislative
and judicial functions of the student government should
come as no suprprise to those of us who remember the cavilling
which greets each EC election, and the very real objections
raised against so much power placed in the hands of so few.

A good amount of care was expended on these new changes
in the Constitution, A greater amount will be necessary to
insure their success. What was hammered out with no little
attention to detail and the possible results of these actions
can quite easily die a horrible, wriggling death if met with
indifference or hostitlity. The student body has been given
the opportunity for representation and a voice in our govern-

A Few Comments On The EC
And On Constitutional Changes

\ttention Executive Committee members:

you missed a good Constitutional Convention!

Yes, after going through great efforts to insure their ap-
pointments to the Constitutional Convention, the majority of
the EC members, our elected Student Body leaders, went
through equally great efforts to stay away,

Perhaps, their rationale for leading in absentia was they
were unable to dominate the Convention, Or perhaps they
simply did not care. Neither seems to be a satisfactory ex-
planation.

One exasperated delegate commented, “I don't think half
the EC has shown up for this Convention. The leaders have
failed to lead.”

Discussion during the Constitutional Convention.

Stewart Discusses ‘Themes,
Moods As Reflected In Music

By DOUG BURTON

As a kid growing up on the out-
skirts of Chicago’s west side, com-
poser Robert Stewart learned to play
the violin at a time when violin
cases were more commonly present
at the performances of the Capone
mob. The ice cream store across
from his house was a gambling
front, and a neighbor's driveway was
even the site of a gangland execu-
tion. The kids grew up straight
though; at sixteen he got fifty cents
for playing “Blue Moon” and “So-
phisticated Lady” at a playground
dance and has been making the
violin pay ever since. His most re-
cent work, “String Quartets No, 3,”
performed by the lowa Quartet, is
latest testament to a long creative
effort.

Now head of the Music and
Drama department at Washington
and Lee, Mr. Stewart is a recipient
of several “Glenn Grants in Aid,”
a MacDowell Fellowship and “The
Best Composition Award” in 1966.
He has served on judging panels
for composition awards for “Student
Composition Awards” of BMI,
Southeastern Composers League and
others.

About his “String Quartet No. 3,”
Mr. Stewart writes: “The construc-
tion is based on two hexachords of
a 12 tone row. The first hexacord
contains a perfect Sth, a minor 2nd
and a minor 7th. The second hexa-
chord contains major and minor
2nds, perfect 4ths and augmented
Sths. The omission of 3rds and 6ths
in the row lends a biting and tense

character to the melodic structures
which evolve from the permutation
of intervals in each hexachord.”

The lowa Quartet, called “one of
the best in the world,” by Atlantic
Monthly, has a distinguished inter-
national reputation for its interpreta-
tion of classical chamber music as
will as the music of contenyporary
composers. Attestation to their
prestige is the fact that they play
a set of Stradivarius instruments
once owned by Paganini, on loan
from Washington's Corcoran Gal-
lery.

Stewart composes music as: “a
reflection of man’s culture in the
ethno-musicological sense. While
each composition is a ‘new’ one, the
style is somewhat predetermined by
current existing experiences which
may not be necessarily musical
ones, but which nevertheless estab-
lish the ‘rules of order’ for the work
during its compositional phase. Thus
no particular ‘ism’ controls the
creative process.”

Mr. Stewart is widely known as
a composer and his compositions
have been performed by some of the
leading groups of the United States:
Composers Forum-NYC, Music in
Our Time-NYC, Atlanta Symphony
Orchestra, Roanoke Symphony Or-
chestra, Virginia State Symphony,
and the Albony Symphony Orches-
tra.

The quartet is dedicated to his
wife and was first performed by the
lowa String Quartet at the Uni-
versity of lowa in the fall of 1959.

Prognosis Seen

By DAVID OLSON

Whether you know it or not
there was a Constitutional conven-
tion, of all things, this past week-
end. I'm sure many of us greeted
this event with a bewildered “what
for?” because it seemed to come out
of the woodwork. But if we search
into our memories we will find that
only last spring there was. some
serious talk about reforming the
governmental set-up of the jurisdic-
tion of the Student Body. What
came out of this weekend's delibera-
tions was a sensible and forward-
looking document.

While it is not revolutionary it
certainly is a big step in the direc-
t.on of sensible and participatory
government. Under the proposed
changes the old Executive Commit-
tee will be replaced by two bodies
that will fulfill its present functions.
A twelve-man Honor Council has
been proposed to handle all matters
concerned with the Honor Sysien
and to handle elections and to fill
vacancies that may appear. The
legislative functions of the Execu-
tive Committee will be handled by
a thirty-member Student Senate.
Under the proposed changes the
president, vice-president and secre-
tary will serve with the Honor Coun-
cil and the Senate.

The new set-up will definitely re-
lieve some of the burden presenily
on the Executive Committee. It will
enable more people to take a role in
Siudent government and will lessen
the load on each of the represen‘a-
tives. Not only will more people
become involved but it might be that
more people will want to become
involved in the government when

As Favorable

they realize that their duties will be
in a specific area and that it will
not be as time consuming as it has
been in the past to serve one’s fellow
students,

The separation of powers pro-
posed in the new Constitution is the
most important reform. To have one
deliberative body ruling on legisla-
tive and honorial questions is not
only too much to ask but it is also
dangerous. Unknown to us there
may at one honor trial have been
a decidedly (political consideration
that came before the E.C., in the
course of the Honor trial. This is
not meant to be a slight at the
integrity of the members of any
E.C, but it could happen and if it
did the student in question would
be in very hot water. What I am
saying is that while the proposed
Honor Council is not political (as
it should be) it comes closer to that
point than does the present E.C.
Chis is a definite invyprovement and
a much desired and needed one.

One can only at this point urge
that this new Constitution receive
the support of the student body.
It deserves that support and it also
deserves our patience and our open-
mindedness. Some delegates com-
plained that certain members of the
E.C. were missing during the final
sessions of the convention. Hope-
fully this new Constitution will alevi-
ate the beleagured feeling of the
members of the student government.
President Fran Lawrence must be
congratulated on his job this week-
end. It will most surely go down as
a thankless job but it was his brain-
child and deserves our thanks for
his diligence and hard work.

We are the heirs of a firee heritage,
yet we are as well the children of
autocracy, Our ancestors sought
America as a sanctuary and made
it a land of opportunity which—for
all its inequalities and faults—pro-
vided more benefits to a greater
share of its citizens than any other
nation has ever done. This ‘became
a nation of individual liberties, most
noted for recognizing as rights per-
sonal freedoms never before en-
joyed by any populace. We were the
“New Order of the Ages,” we were
that “Daring Experiment” — tha‘
thundered its promise to all men in
all lands. Somewhere in this century
the dream has gone wrong: some-
where in this century Horatio Alger
died and Lo! rose again in the guise
of Babbitt.

And now the grandchildren of
those who forged this nation with
the dual bonds of patriotism and
freedom are enslaved by the ever-
growing dynamism of the state.
That dedication to the freedoms of
all men has become a mockery in
the relentless and mutual leaching
of our indivdual liberties by the ar-
rogant bureacracy and grasping poli-
ticians of our government. We have
little enough of our heritage left to
us in this era of the Space Age:
the pride we feel in our nation’s
having placed men on the moon is
but a ‘bittersweet crumb which can
hardly placate for the loss of our
once-precious and inalienable free-
doms.

and it is among the greatest tragedies
of history that the American people
have allowed themselves to ‘be seduc-

Being only one of seven girls on
the Washington and Lee University
campus of 1,527 boys, could, I sup-
pose, be an exciting experience. It
could mean an endless round of
dates, never having to open a door
myself, and being the center of at-
tention.

It could be—but it isn't. I can’t
really say that I am disappointed,
though.

I came to W&L as a student, to
take journalism courses that I could
not get at Hollins. But many of the
professors and my fellow students
treated me as as though I was study-
ing for the proverbial “M.R.S.” de-
gree. Or they thought that I was a
subversive Women's Liberation
agent sent to break down the bar-
riers of male chauvinism. Or they
ignored me. At any rate, few took
seriously the fact that I bought
textbooks; and the idea that I could
be a student, too, well—it crossed
precious few minds.

as hard as the hours out of class.

With Malice Toward Some
An Alternate Solution?

By JEFFREY B. SPENCE

Last week’s issue of this news-
paper printed the ‘basic consensus
Opinions that could be gleaned from
the Honor System poll of earlier
this year. One of these opinions
shows an apparent change in the
thinking of our student body, This
change concerns the ultimate pen-
alty.

Since the inception of the Honor
System, here at W&L, there have
continued to be three major elements
of it that have remained unchanged.
These elements are: student control
and regulation of the system, each
case being tried as a unique and
individual situation based on its on
merit, and the single penalty of
expulsion upon conviction.

Now it appears that the mood of
the student body is changing. The
poll taken by the Executive Com-
mittee has shown that an alternative
penalty of one year’s suspension
could be added. If this were done,
then what would happen to the
Honor System?

Well, we would probably bring
renewed life to a dying institution.
The Honor System is in trouble.
It is in trouble because the part
that says we shall not tolerate honor
violators no longer is holding up.
The reason why is simply that stu-
dents today think twice before they
will turn a fellow student in for a
supposed honor offense.

If a student sees what he thinks
is a potential violation he is more
inclined to pass judgment on it by
himself first, before he turns the
case over to the E.C. Quite simply,
because he realizes that not all acts
by his fellow students can be judged
equally immoral.

   

If stuednts were to increasingly
refrain from turning in alleged viola-
tions, within the next five years the
Honor System would probably be
dead. It appears as if the ultimate
penalty may be the cause of the
second-thoughts that students have
when confronted with an honor
offense situation. If this is the case,
then we must institute a lesser pen-
alty to stand alongside the ultimate
penalty.

One would believe that most stu-
dents here at W&L see things in
gradations as opposed to pure black
and white, In fact, isn’t that what
a liberal education is all about?
Little children see things as all good
or all bad, but the sign of an
adult is one who can perceive the
massive gray area of life that lies
between black and white. To func-
tion successfully in today’s complex
society, it is necessary that we
realize that very little may be con-
sidered fixed or absolute.

There seems to be no reason why
this line of thought must be deleted
from our system of behavioral self-
regulation. It is foolish to consider
every honor offense as equal in
gravity with every other one. Cer-
tainly blatant honor violations de-
serve the ultimate penalty, but is
there not a difference between a man
who cheats out of greed and a man
who cheats under pressure or oul
of sheer panic?

I certainly think there is a dif-
ference. | hope that when the new
Honor Council convenes that they
will take into consideration the
changing mood of the W&L student
body. There is nothing wrong with
having a humane Honor System.

Frank Brooks: From The Bird’s Nes

HoJo Bowl To Be Played

Few of you have heard but there are two football games
this spring that have special importance here at W&L. While
the football team prepares for its Feb. 27 match with the
alumni, another group is getting ready for what they consider
far more important competition. On the Sunday of Hollins
Cotillion, W&L will take on the UNC team in the final bowl
for the season: the Second Annual HoJo Bowl.

The HoJo Bowl had spontaneous beginnings. At the Satur-
day night dance last year the typical goading between schools
resulted in a challenge to a touch football game to be played
Sunday afternoon at the Upper Field of Howard Johnson's
on Williamson Road. As participants and spectators arrived,
the beer was passed out, and before long, the players were

 

warmed up.

The fans cheered wildly as W&L kicked to UNC. The
first set of downs resulted in a punt which Tommy Boman
fielded. Three plays later, W&L had failed to gain and were
forced to punt. Fortunately, there was a unanimous decision
to call that the end of the first half.

As in all bowl half-times, the HoJo Bowl had its festive
ceremonies. The cheerleaders did a dance while the UNC
team built a ragged pyramid. Then the Queen was chosen. His
name was Hacker Caldwell, and he fell off the float twice
which was truly magnificant.

It took a while for the second half to get started, but
when it finally did, the competition became intense. UNC
somehow received again but they were held. W&L failed to
move on the next set of downs. Then UNC snuck a receiver
deep and completed a bomb for the touchdown. All agreed
that the clock ran out, and the W&L gridders hung their
heads mumbling something about next year.

Thus the HoJo Bowl stands 1-0 for UNC, but W&L plans
a strong comeback this year. Your support is needed.

By the way, word's out that Luke has a new coo while
Country Club keeps batting his baby blues at his new honey
from VCU. El Dummo’s page’s pants have an entertaining
gap. Honk is looking, but sees only the goose. Kappa’s back

. Forbes never left, and all are making plans for the big
wedding. And Splu-Daddy is being accused of all sorts of
things, but everyone knows it’s love.

Steve Fluharty will lead the Generals against the Alumni on Feb, 27.

Spring Practice Begins

Coach Buck Leslie began Spring
practice this past Friday with great
weather. Leslie hopes the good
weather holds up long enough for
him to find a running attack to
complement his passing game, which
last fall boasted the nation’s no, 7
college division passer, Steve Flu-
harty.

Fluharty, a rising junior from
Si. Petersburg, Fla., heads the roster
of 70 candidates who put on the
pads Friday. The big question is,
who will catch his passes?

Gone through graduation are re-
ceivers Steve Mahaffey, Bruce Green
and Frank Stearns. Mahaffey was
the top receiver in the country last
fall with 74, an average of over
eight a game.

But there are some quick-handed
youngsters waiting in the wings,
most notably junior Chappy Conrad
of Richmond and soph speedster
Rich Romanelli of Aberdeen, Md.

A bevy of sophomores are bent on
earning starting roles in the offensive

backfield. Five of them, Russ Hewitt,
Mike Brittin (of Great Falls), John
Loesing, Johnny Sheridan (of Lex-
ington) and Bill Wallace (of Roa-
noke) all possess the speed which has
been notably lacking in the Generals’
recent running game. Veteran run-
ning back JoJo Martin, a co-captain,
returns.

Leslie must also shore up the
offensive line which lost Staman
Ogilvie and Steve Hannon to gradua-
tion. Lexington’s 230-pound Johnny
Sorrells is expected to help here.

The defense appears fairly well
set with the return of senior co-
captain Dave Brooks and safety
Marshall Washburn (of Lexington)

“We lost some good boys to
graduation,” noted Leslie, “but there
are a lot of youngsters just waiting
for their chance. The prospects look
good.”

The Generals will work out,
weather permitting, for two weeks,
climaxed by an alumni varsity game
on Saturday, Feb. 27.

The icy sidewalks are doubly
treacherous; if one falls, one might
not only crack a skull, but also bleed
to death as a result of that gravel.
The infirmary is packed with stu-
dents, as Vitamin C is being flown
in from Florida. There has been a
run on Kleenex in Lexington equal-
ed only by the financial panic of
1893. Yes, the cold season is opon
us. But what is that noise in the
gym?

It may still be basketball season,
but for Coach Joe Lyles and dozens
of others, it’s time to loosen rusty
arms, to shanpen dull batting eyes,
and to prepare for the 1971 baseball
season. Actually, some have ‘been
silently at work for some weeks
now, either on their own or in
pairs. The first organizational meet-
ings have already ‘been held. Right
now, the workouts are scheduled
around basketball practice.

Generally, the pitchers and catch-
ers work out two hours, followed by
the infielders and outfielders for two
hours. The next workout is set for
Thursday and all those interested
who have for some reason made
themselves unavailable are welcome
to try out.

Meanwhile, the grunts and groans
from over Wilson Field way tell us
that the annual ritual of spring foot-
ball, one of Washington and Lee’s
supreme tess is underway. Late last
week, the remnants of last season's
squad, sprinkled with the inevitable
number of new faces, drew equip-
ment. Two weeks of arduous labor
will be climaxed by the Alumni
game, currently set for February 27,
an event which is welcomed back
after an absence of several years.

Lynchburg And Loyola Top W&L

By PALMER TRICE

“I'd like to fonget last week.”
This comment was made by Wash-
ington and Lee coach Verne Can-
field, and, if anything stands as
an understatement. The Generals
lost to two different kinds of species,
Greyhounds and Hornets. The Blue
just had a bad streak of ‘hunting,
as they could not get any fowls to
drop.

On Tuesday, the W&L hoopers
went Over the mountains to the not
so friendly confines of Lynchburg
College. The Hornets won by a
90-74 margin, in spite of the fact
that both teams made the same
number of shots from the field. The
Generals, usually a relatively foul-

free team, had 49 foul shots taken
by their opponents. The team had
expected to find the home squad to
be out for revenge, but not the refs?

Aside from not playing well
enough to win, Lynchburg proved to
be a disaster. The Generals had 25
turnovers, and failed to get many
second and third shots. The squad
shot a poor 38 percent from the
field, and only 54 percent from the
foul line. In their losing effort, W&L
was led by Mike Daniel, who had
18 points and 10 rebounds. Skip
Lichtfuss and Paul McClure both
contributed 12 points apiece. “We'll
look forward to the encounter with
Lynchburg next year.”

The fans could not have asked

«>

 

for a closer ball game than that
that was played Friday night. Loyola
College, in Baltimore, brought an
impressive 13-4 record to Doremus.
Two of the losses included games

with Maryland and St. Bonaventure.

The home ball club opened up a
quick 8-1 lead, but the Greyhounds
used a 22-6 run to open up a 23-14
lead. Led ‘by Dave Stone and John
Glace, the Generals batled back to
trail by a 35-31 margin at the half.

In the second half, Loyola came
out in a full court zone press. It had
little effect on the Blue, as they
stormed back on three quick ‘baskets
by Skip Lichtfuss. John Glace put
‘he Generals in front at 43-42. For
several minutes, the lead changed

The 1970-71 Washington and Lee Varsity Basketball Team

W restling Team Tastes Victory

After a series of demoralizing de-
feats, the W&L grapplers made a
dazzling comeback to defeat a strong
Hampden-Sydney team.

Down 10 points at the beginning
of the match, due to the sickness
of two regular starters, the Generals
had ¢o win all but one match.

Pat Buford lost a close decision
in the first match of the evening
the Generals could not afford
another loss if they hoped to re-
main in contention. W&L’s tough
middle weigit division, conyposed of
Wade Gowe, Bill Milton, Bill West,

Jim Stieff, and Charlie Ross, all
pulling weight, defeated tough op-
ponents. Jim Stieff soundly beat his
opponent, despite a bloody nose
which stopped the match several
times.

With the score 15-13, a pin by

Dee Copenhaver would have put the
lid on the victory. In fact, it looked
like he would have to get a pin,
because the Hampden-Sydney heavy
weight looked as mean as a pro
fessional wrestler. He weighed about
230 and had intimidated everyone
by glowering through his head gear
during the entire match. Copenhaver
succeeded in dominating his op
ponent but could not seem to be

able to pin him.

In a desperate attempt in the last
minute of the match, Copenhaver
put a precarious cradle on his op-
ponent. It nearly destroyed the hope
of victory, however, as he lost his
balance and was nearly pinned. De-
spite this he managed to win the
decision by virtue of riding time.

Phen with the score, 18-13, Forrest
Hampton just needed to avoid being
pinned to capture the victory. The
Hampden-Sydney heavyweight pro-
ceeded to violently muscle Hampton
around the mat to the ecstatic cheer-
ing of the white socked, red-neck
local fans. Hampton narrowly avoid-
ed pins several times, however, dur-
ing this time his opponent had lock-
ed his hand illegally four times and
was expelled from the match in the
third period. The final score was
23-13. Coaches Cohen and Skinner
were finally able to enjoy the victory
cigars they had been saving, but

hands, the home club getting several
key baskets from Captain Mike
Daniel. With 4:14 remaining, and
the Blue in front by a 56-55 score,
the Generals called a time out. Skip
Lichtfuss replaced John Glace. After
play had resumed, Skip ‘hit a quick
basket, to lengthen the lead to three.
In the last three minutes, the Gen-
erals held their slim lead, maintain-
ing a stall. The Greyhounds were
forced to foul the home club, who
was in a bonus 1-1 situation. How-
ever, the lid was on the basket, and
nothing would drop. The visitors
took the lead with 24 seconds left,
and Coach Canfield called time out.
The Generals lost the ball and then
stole it ‘back with only six seconds
remaining. Paul McClure took a
last second shot that fell just short.
It was a disappointing loss, especi-
ally as the team played well enough
to win,

Tuesday, the Generals met
Bridgewater away. This should prove
a battle, as W&L is the big game
on the Bridgewater schedule. They
will be out for revenge. After
Bridgewater, the team from Dickin-
son College of Carlisle, Pennsyl-
vania will visit Doremus. Next Satur-
day, the Blue will travel to Fairleig’-
Dickinson, a major college that is
ranked about third in the nation in
defense. If you will pardon the
cliche, the Generals will have their
work cut out from them. A recent
bulletin finds that Washington and
Lee has been seeded number one in
teh CAC tournament. The success of
past years, plus this year’s relative
success has put the burden of the
favorite on our shoulders. Will we
live up to it?

Kumpuris: New
All-American

Washington and Lee University’s
1970 football co-captain, Drew
Kumpuris, has been named to the
second team Academic All-America
squad.

Kumpuris, a senior from Little
Rock, Ark., lettered for three years
at his linebacker position, but was
unable to play his senior year due
to a pre-season knee injury. In the
three years he played, he was con-
sistently one of the leading tacklers.

The college division Academic
All-America squad was selected by
the voting membership of the Col-
lege Sports Information Directors of
America, and conducted by Ted
Emery of the Gator Bowl Associa-
tion. To qualify, a player must have
a ‘B’ average or better for the past
year or cumulative for his college
career.

of us to realize that the only truly
free men are those who are pre-
pared to fight to obtain and to de-

of Patrick Henry are those of us
who are willing—at any time and in
every Way—to sacrifice all we have

We must—as a national populace—

dissent is ended and we are im-

EC Discusses

Constitution,
Student News

(Continued from Page 1)

The Constitution was finally ap-
proved, with Moore dispatching a
few reservations concerning the
Honor System, “in order to get this
before the student body.”

In an appearance before the EC
earlier in the meeting, freshman
Jed Yonge asked the committee to
rescind its previous decision restrict-
ing the University Center newsletter
to a “schedule of events” format.
He suggested that he be able to
write editorials for the publication,
“so that I can express my opinion
and possibly let other students to
do so.”

Yonge maintained that blacks and
other campus groups are offered no
outlet for their viewpoints, and he
acoused The Ring-tum Phi of being
“incredibly ‘biased and  narrow-
minded,”

Lawrence questioned the right of
the EC to subsidize a competitive
campus publication, saying that the
purpose of the university center was
essentially “to keep this building and
ts activities running.” John Moore,
suggesting that a second newspaper
might be desirable, said that “it
should not be done in this way.”

The EC ultimately approved a
resolution permitting Yonge and
others to submit signed articles to
the newsletter, to be printed at the
discretions of its editors.

In further business, Tompkins and
Thompson reported that the Trea-
surer of the university is considering
the prospect of including the “Con-
tact” assessment within the Student
Activities Fee and raising the alloca-
tion to The Ring-tum Phi to allow
possibly for publication of three
pssues every two weeks.

Lawrence also announced that a
new procedure is being initiated for
the organization of athletic clubs
on campus, All such groups must
(a) not involve one of the university's
intercollegiate sports, (b) must have
a faculty advisor, (c) must be ap-
proved through the Assistant Di-
rector of Athletics.

things that required jeans rather
than a dress, so I returned to my

traditional Hollins costume of jeans,

shirt, and tennis shoes. It probably
seems silly to everyone else, but |
believe that when I stopped wearing
dresses all the time and began wear-
ing those old jeans, 1 was accepted
for myself. The guys were much
more ready to treat me as an equal
when they saw that I wasn’t flaunt-
ing clothes or wearing short skints.
And jeans and tennis shoes cer-
tainly lend more to a student image
around here.

Jeans and tennis shoes or not, the
atmosphere changed. The bod inci-
dents became fewer and fewer. |
settled dow nand became rather con-
tent with W&L.

Here I am, well into the second
term with a few observations on this
whole thing. First: the Eight Col-
lege Exchange Program is a work-
able alternative for this school to
coeduction and/or drastic expansion
of the facihities. It should be utilized
to the hilt.

Second: for the first run I suppose
the Exchange Program is working
OK. But W&L really was not psy-
chologically (prepared for women
students—even just seven of them.
For women have traditionally been
weekend creatures in Lexington and
1 suppose many guys have nearly
forgotten that we exist Monday
through Friday, too.

Third: it takes a particular kind
of girl who wil lallow herself to be
put in this situation, It takes a
little of the trailblazed spirit. Every-
thing she does is a “first” and no-
body but nobody wil let her forget
it.

Fourth: it has been well worth the
trauma. To say that it has been an
experience that I shall never forget
just could be the understatement of
the semester.

Convention

members would be selected by the
Senate. Candidates for selection must
submit petitions of 150 names to
be eligible for consideration.

A total of 32 delegates attended
the Convention, which was held in
Evans Dining Hall. Four sessions of
debate and discussion resulted in
about 14 hours of work.

Late Sunday the Convention rec-
ommended the amended Constitu-
tion to the EC for its weekly meet-
ing. If the EC endorses the Consti-
tution drafted by the Convention, a
Student Body referendum would be
needed to change the existing Consti-
tution. If the BC does not approve
this Constitution, a two-third ma-
jority of the students may enact
the Constitution.

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Verne Edwards, in his book
“Journalism in a Free Society,”
states that editorials should, if any-
thing, be more thoroughly factual
and researched than a nonmal news
story. As in the past, the RTP has
thrown this guideline out the win-
dow,

Your editorial concerning Charles
M. Gunn’s bill in the current House
of Delegates was inflammatory,
spoken in broad generalities, and
evidently poorly researched.

The bill will make it possible for
the University to be taxed. An ex-
planation is necessary, however. The
only taxable items will be univer-
sity owned residences. That is, the
few homes W&L maintains, and the
extensive faculty housing maintain-
ed by VMI. The same with other
institutions in the state.

A residence tax could be billed
to the university. It would have to
ibe, according to the provisions of
the new state constitution. Any

WAL is already billed collectively
for utility services. The charges are
then sent to the individuals. The
residence tax would be the same,
passing no further costs to the uni-

Obviously state educators who re-

housing are up in arms. An in-

taxes are devoted to public educa-
tion, which all college faculty mem-
bens should champion.

Yet here in Lexington, members
of W&L and VMI faculties who
take advantage of the on-campus
housing are paying no taxes toward
public education through residence
taxes. Many faculty members do
take advantage of the public school
system. Therefore, people earning
twice to three times the median in-
comes of Lexington residents are not
paying a representative amount to-
ward education.

As Mr. Gunn says, “The bill only
strives at equalization.” A law gradu-
ate of W&L, Gunn has presented a
very just bill, with no intention of
further gouging the university com-
munity. More obvious and blatant
moves by the city deserve attention,
ie. parking meters, license tags.

While my statements may be in-
terpreted as unsound by the editorial
staff, I ask you to at least talk
to Mr. Gunn before making any
more blanket statements in regard
to the issue. Max Brantley

New Constitution Dumped By Light Turnout

‘It Was A Thought Out Of Its Time;
Of Course I’m Disappointed,’--Azuma

The new Student Body Constitu-
tion failed to get the needed votes
yesterday. At least 740 votes were
required for the proposed changes
to go into effect. Only 530 votes
were cast in favor of the amend-
ments to the 45 year old Constitu-
tion.

Just 43 per cent of the W&L stu-
dents cast a ballot at one of the five
polls. Of those casting their votes,
84 per cent favored the changes.

Contacted by telephone last night,
Student Body President Fran Law-
rence said, “simply not enough peo-
ple voted.”

“My interpretation is that it didn’t
generate sufficient student interest,”
Lawrence continued, “I don’t think
the students want a new constitu-
iton.”

When questioned as to why the re-
ferendum defeated the EC proposal,
Lawrence said, “We might have call-
ed the question to a vote too soon.”

Glenn Azuma, who was the chair-
man of the Constitutional Ohanges
Sub-committee, commented, “It was
a thought out of its time. Of course
I'm disappointed.”

“At least it wasn’t beaten by nega-
tive voting, but was beaten by a lack
of voting,” Azuma added. “I don't
think the lack of voter turnout is due
to a lack of publicity.”

Azuma was making reference to
the special edition of The Ring-tum
Phi, which printed much of the text
of the Constitution. Also the EC
mimeographed several copies of the
Constitution for distribution,

The basic changes in the new Con-
stitution dealt with revamping the
siudent government's structure. The
Executive Committee would be re-
placed by two bodies—an Honor
Council and a Student Senate. The
Honor Council was to have exclu-
sive jurisdiction over the Honor Sys-
tem. Administrative and legislative
functions of the student body would
be maintained under the auspices
of the Student Senate.

Changes in the ourrent Constitu-
tion have been considered by the
Executive Committee most of this
academic year. The proposed Con-
stitution, which fell short at the bal-
lot box, had travelled a long way.

Early this year the Executive Com-
mittee established a Constitutional
Changes Sub-committee to investi-
gate the posstbility of changes in the
Constitution. Glenn Azuma and Sta-
man Ogilvie headed this group. After
several meetings and an open forum,
Azuma explained, “It was felt that
more than amendments were needed.
We believed that an entire new Con-
stitution would be the best idea.”

Bh

a.
al

The sub-committee drafted a pro-
posed scheme of student govern-
ment. This scheme involved the con-
cept of a Student Senate and Honor
Council,

After hearing the report of the
sub-committee, the Executive Com-
mittee decided to call a Constitu-
tional Convention to draft a new
Constitution. The EC called for peti-
tions from people interested in serv-
ing as delegates. These delegates
were required to present petitions
with 25 signatures.

The 32 delegates convened Febru-
ary 12 for a three day set of ses-
sions. The convention recommended
the creation of a Senate and Honor
Council to the EC. An entirely new
constitution was presented to the
EC for consideration.

February 15 the EC studied the
proposal of the convention. The
committeemen made minimal
changes in the wording and endorsed
the new constitution, At the same
meeting the committee established
yesterday as the voting date for a re-
ferendum.

According to the existing constitu-
tion, an EC endorsed change in the
constitution required a referendum
vote of one half of the student body.
The vote yesterday did not live up
to that requirement.

Poco presented a two hour country-rock performance in Doremus Saturday night. Sha-Na-Na will entertain at

WA&L next month.

An Editorial

The Time Has Come, The Walrus Said...

... to talk of a couple of things. We find it
almost impossible to believe that with all the
coverage the Executive Committee, the Con-
stitutional Convention members and The
Ring-tum Phi have given to the proposed
changes in the Constitution, the students of
Washington and Lee have acted as if they
haven't even heard of a Constitution—much
less the proposed changes.

633 students turned out at the polls yester-
day. The Constitutional changes proposed by
the Executive Committee have been defeated
not because of any great surge of student in-
terest in preserving W&L’s traditional mode
of student government, not because the stu-
dents read the text of the proposal with open
minds and decided that the changes were not
in the best interest of the student body, but
because the students—or the majority of them
at any rate—just don’t care.

Because they don’t care enough to take
even a remote interest in their student gov-
ernment, we're happy that the proposals did
not pass. It would be devastating to have a
new student senate with only one candidate
to fill each office. In fact, what would happen
if there weren't enough candidates to fill the
positions ?

Anyone who thinks that anything dynamic
or valuable can be accomplished by The Stu-
dent Body of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity ought to be put in an institution for frus-
trated idealists.

But the light voter turnout yesterday is

only one more proof of the hackneyed state-
ment: W&L students are apathetic. Last
year as well as the year before, only one stu-
dent ran for the office of Vice President of the
student body. No one even applied for Fancy
Dress President last year. Dan Silberberg’s
having trouble finding people to work for the
Mock Convention last year. And The Ring-
tum Phi gets complaints each week about its
contents, but no one wants to put their work
where their mouth is.

The conclusion we've drawn from the vote
yesterday is not a new one. Students have
proved themselves to be as lethargic as the
American public: not until something like the
prospect of eliminating Saturday classes, or
closing down the University does the whole
of the student body put on the “concerned”
individual’s song and dance. Not because
they're interested in doing something for the
good of the University, The students are after
what's in it for them.

Whether the students know it or not, in
loco parentis is still here at W&L. The Exe-
cutive Committee. The Student Control Com-
mittee. The Curriculum Committee. The Fi-
nancial Relations Committee. The Dance
Board. The Publications Board. They've
been right here all along to serve you, watch
after you and tell you when you go wrong.
You don’t have to worry about a thing. We
may be fed up, frustrated, and tired of you
out there. But we'll be here, asking for your
help, and confident that we won't get it.

In their Monday night mectng
the members of the Executive Com-
mittee made final plans for balloting
procedure in Tuesday's Constitution-
al referendum. They also formulated
a position, to be presented for fac-
ulty consideration, concerning the
continuation of the Independent
Exam system initiated last term.

lt was revealed that, in a survey
taken after the first trial of the less
restrictive exam schedule, some 200
of 250 students questioned confessed
to have heard some comment con
cerning the relative difficulty of a
cermin examination during the test
ing period. These “value judgments”

consisted usually of a camal expres-
sion or phrase, ¢.g., “The test was a
breeze” or “It was really hard.”

The E.C. was concerned that such
negligem comments, though not nec-
essarily intended as “cheating” and
not even necessarily helpful to an-
other student, comprised techn'cal
grounds for honor system prosecu-
tion. They ceded that such incidents
are extremely difficult to identify as
honor violations, but they feared
that continued student carelessness
would jeopardize the freedom of the
new independent exam procedure

Glenn Azuma pointed out that, to
be consistent with its previous posi-

REVIEW and OUTLOOK [Letters To The Editor...

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
February 24, 1971

Out Of The Educational Marketplace

This September the majority of students’ parents will be
writing a $1,100 check payable to Washington and Lee Uni-
versity—one-half of the total tuition for the next academic
year. Next year’s tuition fee of $2,000 isn’t scheduled to be the
peak in the steady rise of fees since 1960 from $750 to $2,000
this 1970-71 academic year.

After next year, the tentative prognostications of Univer-
sity Treasurer James Whitehead put the price tag of a W&L
education at $2,300 for 1973. But-W&L isn’t the only school
which finds it necessary to raise tuition costs annually; the
spiral in the price of a private education is common to private
institutions throughout the country. Inherent in this rising
cost of private education is the threat that the private institu-
tions will find themselves priced out of the education market.

Take the average middle class family. Seymour wants to

go to college—not that he’s sure why, but Mom and Dad did
the same thing so why shouldn't he? Mom and Dad know
the value of a college education for their Seymour, so they
shop around and decide that there are some good colleges in
the Virginia-North Carolina area. Finally it comes down to
the question of whether or not Seymour's Mom and Dad can
afford the cost of an education at W&L or at U.Va. Sey-
mour’s been accepted at both places. He doesn’t know what ex-
actly he wants to do so he'll try a little of everything his first
vear at school, whether it be in Lexington or Charlottesville.
' W&L can offer him one thing over other state schools:
close contact with his professors in a teaching-learning situa-
tion. But it’s 1972, money’s tight, Dad could afford it, but why
not go to the cheaper school?

This extremely simplified, facile story is attempting to point
out the alarming difficulties Washington and Lee will face in
the future due to tuition rises. In effect, the University is
pricing itself out of the pay-as-you-learn education plan upon
which it draws most of its students. In the next 10 years, W&L
could put itself out of the education market place altogether if
by 1980 the fee is $4,000 or $3,500, or even a little over $3,000.
Will the average parent of a student at W&L be willing to pay
that high a price for a W&L education when he could get the
same for his son at a state-supported institution—perhaps
ever the one that his state tax dollars support? We think not.

There is an alternative which has been presented by one
private institution which we think is an practical solution to
parental financing of a college education: let the student pay.
Yale University has instituted a plan whereby students can
defer the cost of their college years and pay in installments on a
percentage basis after their education at the college is com-
pleted.

The major benefit of the Yale plan, though, is that the de-
cision on the institution for a college education rests solely
with the student and not with his parents. With the student
footing the bill for his own education in his later life, a decision
about his educational future becomes more qualitative and less
quantitative as it is with the parent involved. Graduates from
Washington and Lee do not fare poorly in the world after
their yeats here; there is no reason for the University to su-
spect that in the following years they will not continue to
do so,

We encourage the trustees and the administration to ex-
amine the Yale plan closely with respect to the problems of ris-
ing costs at this University. By 1980 Washington and Lee could
be offering quality education which will be regarded as a lux-
ury by many parents of potential freshmen. And once the
educational process here becomes equatd solely with dollar
signs, W&L had better start looking for a modern-day George
Washington,

Look To Your Right, Mr. Yonge

\ppearing before the Executive Committee in its February
15 meeting, Mr. Jed Yonge claimed that The Ring-tum Phi
offered no opportunity for certain groups or individuals to ex-
press their opinions,

We are “incredibly biased and narrow-minded,” according
to Mr. Yonge. Therefore he feels the need to demand of the
EC that he be able to express his own view in the University
Center Newsletter,

We honestly wonder why Jed Yonge thinks he needs to go
to another newsletter to print his opinions for all to read, If
he wants to express his viewpoint, why can't he write a letter
to the editor of this newspaper? Judging from the content of
the four columns to the right of this one, we fail to see how
we've been “biased” or “narrow-minded,”

No wthe only reasoning we can ferret out of this whole mat
ter is that Mr. Yonge is saying that he believes our opinions to
be “biased” and “narrow-minded.” If that is in fact what he
means, we'd have to agree with him there: we don't hold two
opinions at once on anything we write about, Yes, in our edi
torial columns we are biased and we are “narrow-minded”
because we don’t attempt to support five different opinions
with five conflicting arguments

The Ring-tum Phi's existence would be quite dull indeed
if our readers agreed with us in everything that appeared in
these columns or elsewhere in the paper, There is nothing more
satisfying than to be able to stimulate the expression of diverse
opinions in thse pages. For if we were “biased” and “narrow
minded” in the publication of these pages each week, who
would read it? No one can learn anything from the experience
of talking to himself

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Let's get right down to the heart
of the matter. One of the main rea-
sons that many students are opposed
to ROTC on this campus is that it
is part of our military establish-
ment. This is a fact and ought to
be an issue.

I for one do not want any part
of that establishment on a campus
that I am attending. However the
opinion of one person usually does
not count for much. What people
want most of the time are facts.
Well, then, here are some facts
about our boys in the Pentagon:
(1) They have defoilated thousands
of acres of forests in Vietnam so
that the “enemy” could not hide
there. The final result was an almost
irreparable damage to the ecology
of the country that we are supposed
to be protecting. (2) They have
purposely dropped napalm on vil-
lages inhabited with civilians be-
cause there might have been Viet

BY MARC SMALL

I have seen many things change in
my two-and-one-half years at Wash-
ington and Lee: the declining mem-
bership in fraternities, the lessening
popularity of coat-and-tie, the met-
eoric life and death of the Progres-
sive Student Alliance in 1969, the
short existence of the Truck Stop
Liberation Movement and Stop, and
the morbidity of the weakening Stu-
dent Coalition. Of all the multitude
of events in my University existence,
the one sure and steady factor has
been the inability of any radical-lib-
eral group to remain in existence for
longer than five weeks.

On the other hand, the Conserva-
tive Society, Young Americans for
Freedom, and the University Repub-
licans have all maintained themselves
handsomely: the University Repub-
licans have never been below 20%
of the student body since 1965, and
have entrenched themselves as by
far the largest studem group.

This is not being written as either
a rejoicing or a lament, but rather as
an observation of the student Left's
repeated failure to organize and
maintain a structured form. The rea-
sons ate many and manifest—the re-
jection of organized pobitical parties,
the increased number of students liv-
ing in the county, the lotus-eater's
alternative of drugs. Yet, these do
not cover all students, and when I
asked a prominent Young Democrat
why they were never politically ac-

Cong there. (3) They have ordered,
or at least tolerated, massacres such
as My-Lai and have not put the
blame where it belongs (Gen. Koster
is still free). (4) They cannot give
an accurate figure on how much
money and equipment has been used
in Cambodia and openly admit that
they have no idea of what we have
used in Vietnam. (5) They supply aid
(unreported until recently) to coun-
tries like Spain and Greece. Ordi-
narily | don’t mind helping countries
defend themselves, but when I re-
call that both of these countries are
dictatorial and repressive, 1 wonder
what the generals use for morals.
That is not all: there have been
books written on the subject. But the
important thing to remember here
is that all the above is being done
WITHOUT the consent of Con-
gress.

If you think that this is an attack
on the military, you are right. But
it is more than just that. The

tive, | was told that “This is a Re-
publican canypus!”

To a degree this is true, and yet it
ibegs the question, for shouldn't such
a campus as this—sedate, compla-
cent, and conservative—be the ideal
‘breeding grounds for the Left?

Even where organized, the Left at
W&L leans on outside support: I
was told Jast Spring that if the fac-
ulty failed to close W&L, then thugs
from University of Virginia would.
This rebiance for speakers (Jane
‘Fonda, Rubin, et al), onganiza-
tional aid, and impetus from the out-
side is in sharp contrast to the Uni-
versity Republicans, who are as ac-
tive as any chub in the state, and
who, rather than relying on others,
themselves aid smaller and less ac-
tive clubs,

T .E. Lawrence, in “The Seven
Pillars of Wisdom,” observes that:
“All men dream: but not equally.
Those who dream by night in the
dusty recesses of their minds wake in
the day to find that it was vanity:
‘but the dreamers of the day are dan-
gerous men, for they may act their
dream with open eyes, to make it
possible.” In this vein, the radical
factions at Washington and Lee ap-
pear the dreamers of the night, and
their dreams evaporate when flush-
ed with the cold harshness of reality.
On the other hand, the dynamic aoti-
vities Of the conservative groups re-
veals them as the dreamers of the
day, for they truly HAVE worked to
make their dreams possible.

 

With Malice Toward Some

SCC And SAC: Why Both?

BY JEFFREY B. SPENCE

Hf one dissects any bureaucracy,
more often than not he will find that
the parts that make up the whole are
in the form of committees. Washing-
ton and Lee és no exception when i!
comes to having their fair share of
committees.

The student body has one com-
mittee that seems to be almost com-
pletely useless. The particular or-
ganization in question is the Student
Control Committee.

The reason this committee is use-
less? It does not do anything. It is
supposed to govern student behavior,
or rather, misbehavior when the act
committed is not within the realm of
the Honor System. Well, that may be
what 4 is supposed to do, but that is
not what it does do.

The Student Control Committee's
decisions about a student's behavior
are at all times subject to review by
the Student Affairs Committee. This
group is composed of five students
and five faculty members, all of
them having full voting privileges.
They are the ones who have the final
power in deciding any student's fate
if he is acoused of misconduct,

This appears to have an extreme
affect on the way the student run
committee operates. Student Control
is tke a pendulum in its decisions, It
awings back and forth between
strength and weakness in meting oul
punishment depending on whether
big daddy Student Affairs has recent.
ly slapped them on the knuckles.

if Student Control condemns a
student too harshly he may refer it
to the higher committee for review
There have been enough cases of
punishment reduction for him to feel
that he can get a reprieve. However,
if Student Control goes too easy on
someone that guy better be ready to
have to come before Student Affairs

Obviously W&L has one too many
disciplinary committees. The ques-
tion is which one do we eliminate?
if we get rid of the Student Affwir's

Commitiee, then some elements of

the faculty will complain that the
students either have too much power
or that they will ‘be too lenient on
each other when they get this power.
In other words, the practice of hell-
raising will immediately go on the
upswing, and besides, students aren't
mature enough to handle themselves.

The opposing side would see it
this way: W&L has a history of
keeping the faculty out of the stu-
dent's behavior problems which is
readily agreed to by both sides under
the auspices of the Honor System,
Even with all its difficulties, students
do not want a faculty-run Honor
Code,

Since we obviously have one too
many committees to run student
conduct, then something has got to
give. Therefore it is about time that
the Student Affair's Committee dis-
card and return the power to the peo-
ple of WAL, the students.

If we, the students, can be trusted
to run our own affairs of honor, then
certainly we should be able to run
our affairs of personal conduct. Isn't
that what being a gentleman on this
campus is all about? Assuredly con-
ducting oneself as a gentleman is
not limited to just matters of honor
as we define lying, cheating, and
stealing to be.

Gentlemanly conduct also extends
to personal relations with each other,
Thus, one can see no feason why
just a single, student controtied, com-
mittee cannot ajudicate the conduct
of students. If this committee needs
a higher authority to turn to, then let
it be an open jury trial as in the case
of our present Honor System. The
jury would still be composed of stu-
dents and thus it would be a trial by
one's peers.

Let us fet the faculty do what it is
paid to do, teach us and then judge
our performance in the learning pro-
cess. Let's allow the students to
judge themselves in personal con
duct. 4 we are mature enough to
judge our honor, then we are mature
enough to judge our actions, Peace

presence of the military relates to
the function of the University. The
punpose of a University is to help
build meaningful citizens of a so-
ciety. Any administration which al-
lows such an agency on their campus
is, I think, doing a disservice to
themselves, the students and the
good reputation of that school. Some
gay that ROTC builds leadership and
helps us defend ourselves. Now re-
read the second paragraph. Is that
the kind of leaders that you want
defending you? I think not! When
‘the army becomes an instrument of
tthe people, not against it, then let
them come back on campus. Until
that time it is our duty to tell them
to pack up and GET OUT!

The purpose of this letter is two-
fold. 1 wanted to express my own
Opinion and also raise some ques-
tions that need answering. The latter
is more important. It is time that
the students and faculty start re-
examining these issues. One might
be surprised at what you discover.
In any case, THINK!

Peacefully yours,
Leonard Z. Kaufmann ‘74

On Honor Survey

BY PHIL THOMPSON

I am sure that many students and
members of the Washington and Lee
community have been both curious
and concerned as to the outcome of
the Honor System survey which the
Executive Committee conducted ear-
lier in the academic year. Now that
the results of that survey have been
fully aired by the Executive Com-
mittee, a few comments need to be
set forth in explanation of the rela-
tively lengthy period of deliberation
and in regard to the subsequent find-
ings,

 

For Survey Results,
See Page 2

 

The purpose of the study of the
present Honor System was not to
necessarily implement immediate
change. It was motivated by a desire
to capture the ourrent consensus of
student sentiment toward the Honor
System, if in fact there exists such a
vital force on our campus. The sub-
committee in charge of this survey
worked on the premise than in any
community any system of laws or
values is only as strong as the sulp-
port exhibited for it by the members
of that community. An honor sys-
tem which holds out as sacred cer-
tain values which are of little or no
significance to the general student
‘body is certainly far more distasteful
than no honor system at all.

Perhaps the members of the sub-
committee envisioned themselves as
enlightened practitioners who were
to extract areas of maligancy or
structural weakness from the overall
system. | myself expected to find
strong student sentiment in favor of
greater delineation of the confines of
the system and/or support for pos-
sible codification phus a reflection of
the seeming discontent with the ab-
solute penalty. Yet the student body
once again managed to confound
the EC and perhaps even themselves
on this occasion.

First of all, only 337 students re-
sponded to the questionnaires which
were made available on campus for
an entire week. It would be quite
simplistic and very gratifying to har-
bor the belief that the other three
fourths of the student body are per-
fectly content with our present
Honor System and thus they saw no
need to respond at all, And no one
member of the sub-committee which
drafted the questionnaire has delud-
ed himself by discontinuing the ami-
guity which existed in several of the
questions which accounted for some
degree of abstention, | am sure.

Yet I feel that there are two pro-
per conclusions to be attached to the
returns: 1) The majority of the stu-
dents at Washington and Lee take
the Honor System for granted and
they are perfectly willing to pay lip
service to it, as long as it does not af-
fect them personally or require some
degree of personal action: 2) That a
new trend has exerted itself on
campus whereby each and every in-
dividual feels free to exercise his
own personal code of honor.

Il am quite confident that Wash-

CANDIDATES FOR STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT—Tom Mays
(left) and Steve Robinson, The Candidates will speak tonight in Com-
mons at 7:00,

Election Timetable Set;
EC Debates Referendum

The Executive Committee Mon-
day prepared the way for the upcom-
ing student body elections and also
formulated the make-wp and ballot-
ing procedure for the student delega-
tion to the new University Council,
In other action they also decided to
defer any proposals which might
have arisen from the release of the
Honor System survey last week.

The following candidates present-
ed complete positions for student
body offices: for President of the
Student Body, Tom Mays and Steve
Robinson; for Vice-President, Glenn
Azuma and John Cassell; for Secre-
tary, Jim Davis, Rick Gray, and
Bruce Madison; for Dance Board
Vice-President, Richard Middleton
and Gary Poliakoff; for Fancy Dress
President, Brian Greig and Paul
Suthern.

Speeches by the above candidates
for the “Big Five” positions will be
delivered tonight at 7:00 in Evans
Dining Hall. The E.C, also announc-
ed the following Election schedule:
General Election—March 8, Run-
off—March 11, Class and E.C, elec-
tions Petitions due—March 15, Gen-
eral Election and University Council

etitions due—March 22, and Run-
off plus University Council election
—March 25.

Several questions faced the E.C,
Monday concerning the newly form-
ed University Council, an advisory
and appellate body composed of 12
students and 12 faculty members. (1)
Who is to compose the student sec-
tor of the Council? (2) how will
these studenis be designated? (3)
should the Council be included in
the present Student Body Constitu-
tion?

The menvbers of the E.C. agreed
that the general election would be
preferable to appointment of the

University Council members. Sta-
man Ogilvie added, “I see no reason
why it would be necessary, or even
desirable, that the University Coun-
cil consist of representatives propor-
tional to each class.”

Ogilvie asserted that the Council
should be weighted in favor of the
upperclassmen, since experience and
good relations with faculty will be
of particular importance in the func-
tion of the Council.

Tom Mays pointed out that inter-
est for student positions on the
Council has been keen, and he urged
minimal restriction on running for
these offices. “We must arrive at

Council Seems ‘Promising’

Both students and faculty mem-
bers were encouraged with the Uni-
versity Council meeting. This body
held its initial session last Saturday
morning.

Organizational and procedural
business dominated this meeting.
However, the council decided to
elect co-chairmen, one student and
one teacher. The election of the
chairmen was postponed umil a later
date.

The Council is composed of 30
members, Twelve faculty members
are elected by their peers and 12 stu
dents are elected to the group also.
Six members serve in an ex officio
basis: President of the University,
President of the Student Body, and
the four deans,

Gym Is One-Third Completed

BY JOHN ROBINSON

Construction of Washingion and
Lee's $3 million gymnasium is about
on schedule. This assurance came
this week from D. E. Brady, Super
intendent of Buildings and Grounds
Farris Hotehkiss, Director of Um
versity Development, also assured
us, “I'm confident that the funds can
be raised in time.”

The major remodeling and addi
tion to Doremus Gymnasium is sone
duled to be completed in Septenrber
Several new features are inchided in
the gym's blueprints. A new baske!
ball court and swimming pool are
planned. Also more handball courts
and athletic offices are foreseen in
the new structure

The actual work on the building
has been slightly stalled by the ab
sence of steel erection personne!

However, work scheduled for later

dies in the project has been moved
up to complete the job on time.

“They're about two weeks behind
schedule,” Brady explained, “but the
contractor says he'll be finished on
ime.”

“The roof could have been on by
now, if it weren't for this delay,”
Brady added. “But the delay hasn't
stopped the job, the brick work has
gone on ahead of schedule.”

When questioned about opening
sections of the gym this year, Brady
was pessimistic. “I don't think there
is any possibility that the handball
courts will be ready this year. We
had hoped to have them in use this
winter

A job which parallels the actual
consiruction in difficulty is financing
this entire venture. In charge of that
phase is the Development Office. and
more specifically its director, Parris
Hotohk iss

About $1 million of the needed $1

million has been raised Hotchkiss
reported. “We are looking for major
gifts to finance this consiruction. not
a fund raising drive. The reason we
are seeking large gifts is that W&L.'s

Hotchkiss pointed out. “I think we
can do it. Fund rang is roughly on
par with construction, The work is

raised one third of the funds

“| think the council shows consider-
able promise. It must develop its
own method of doing things, It is a
place where all attitudes from the
faculty and students can be ex-
pressed.”

“I think it is significant that co-
chairmen be elected for this coun-
cil, The students and faculty will be
on more equal footing.”

“As I see it the Council has a
threefold function: final control over
student affairs, review of faculty
committees and a forum of discus-
sion, where items of concern can be
studied.”

No student representatives have
been elected to the University Coun
cil, so the Executive Committeemen
served as representatives for this
first meeting. Sudent Body Presi-
dent Fran Lawrence served as

spokesman for the students who at-
tended the session,

Lawrence reflected that “every-
thing went pretty well, we basically
laid out general plans for future
meetings. I want to tell everybody
that the meetings are open and the
council plans to meet on Saturdays
before each monthly faculty meet-
ing.”

“Everything went rather infor-
mally.” Lawrence noted. “I was
really happy with the attitude of the
faculty. They seemed interested in
what students think.”

The permanent members to the
University Council will be elected
during the normal balloting for class
officers and EC menrbers, March 25
Petitions with 50 signatures will be
required from candidates and nvust
be submitted by March 22.

sophomore and junior class, He
also has been on the IFC, Faculty
Admissions Committee, and the
Student Recruitment Committee,
of which he is currently chairman.

Filing petitions for Vice President
were Glenn Azuma and John Cas-
sell, both juniors. Azuma is from
New Milford, N.J. and Cassell is
from Virginia Beach, Va.

Three men are in the race for Sec-
retary of the Student Body. Jim
Davis, Petersburg, Va., Rick Gray,
Dallas, Texas, and Bruce Madison,
Louisville, Ky. are all seeking the
office. Davis and Madison are jun-
iors, and Gray is a sophomore.

Richard Middleton and Gary Po-
liakoff filed petitions for Dance
Board Vice President. Richard is
from Charlottesville, Va. and Spar-
tanburg, S.C. is Gary’s home.

Brian Greig from Austin, Texas
will run against Paul Suthern from
Fairfield, Conn. for President of
Fancy Dress.

In its meeting last evening the
IFC nominated Bill Andrews, SAE,
and Bob LaRue, Sigma Chi for
President. Nominated for Vice Presi-
dent of the IFC were Griff Steel,
Chapel Hill, N.C. and Ken Evans,
Bartlesville, Okla.

Alan Sondheim
Scheduled For
Concert, Talks

Alan Sondheim, leading electronic
musician, will visit Washington and
Lee Thursday and Friday (March 4
and 5) to deliver a series of lectures
and demonstrations and a_ public
concert.

Sondheim and his groun draw
from many sources in their work:
oniental, classical, electronic, jazz
and rock. They are, however, seek-
ing to create an entirely new body of
music in which those influences are
avoided. Instead of a synthesis of ex-
isting sounds, then, they attempt to
deal with a “musical absolute,” and
to do so as emotionally as possible.

The two-<lay event at Washington
and Lee is sponsored by the Con-
cert Guild, and all events are open
to the public. The first program,
scheduled for Thursday at 4 p.m. in
Lee Chapel, will be a lecture and
demonstration of electronic music,
dealing with recent art, synthesizer,
design, symmetry, information the-
ory and acoustic coding.

Friday's programs will begin at
11:40 a.m., also in the Chapel, with
a lecture on recent developments in
the electronic music field. Sondheim
and his group's concert is scheduled
for 8 that evening, again in the Lee
Ohapel.

Sondheim first became interested
in music in 1962 at the age of 19. He
is completely selfdaught. At the
same time, he acquired a passionate
interest in buying and restoring old
instruments, beginning with wood-
winds and moving quickly to every
other type.

Part of the Sondheim programs
will be entirely improvised within
a set electronic or acoustic structure

the music is partly determined by
the initial situation.

 

The concrete base for the new

swimming pool has been poured,

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

March 3, 1971

To The Students, With Respect...

We've decided that it’s past due for a few comments which
we were unable to insert in our front page editorial of last
week. It has been customary for the editors of The Ring-tum
Phi to lambast the Executive Committee, the Dance Board,
the faculty and the administration in the hope that the student
body would take some note of what the newspaper had to say
about improving the institutions that supposedly worked for
the good of the students.

But we have directed our attention in the past few weeks to
the student body itself, rather than their institutions, because
we found (much to no one’s surprise) that the Washington
and Lee student body was singularly sonambulant in its at-
titude towards the new constitution which failed by default to
pass students’ approval last week. A week after we printed that
editorial on the front page, we've realized we've been grossly
unfair.

In attempt to rectify that error in judgment of last week,
we put forth several observations and admonitions for the stu-
dent body in which we hope our readers will take some in-
terest:

@ Students at Washington and Lee are no wilder than
they were 40 years ago. They are perhaps less so—there are
fewer fights nowadays with the cadets at V.M.I. and street
brawling is altogether extinct as a pastime. As for being ac-
tive on campus, students attending the 1971 Washington and
Lee certainly do not share the same excitement that the 1951
students probably had during elections for student government
officers or for Mock Convention preparations. The most signi-
ficant comment that can be made about 1971 Washington and
Lee is that students have longer hair than the students of the
past 40 years have had, and that the tradition of conventional
dress is being permanently entombed by zealous defenders of
the right of students to wear what they want to wear.

@ The students themselves have institutionalized their
own adolescence, Every student institution on the W&L camp-
us receives support from the student body only when it pro-
poses some motion which will immediately make the lives of
the students more congenial (i.c., Saturday classes were eli-
minated because of student response—now nothing happens
at W&L on Saturday except sports events). The anguished cry
against the concept of in loco parentis echoes with hypocrisy
now: students demand to have charge of their own affairs in
the matter of female visiting hours in the dormitories or the
fraternity houses—not because they want “the experience of
being able to govern one’s own social behavior”—hecause they
want the freedom to have women in more private quarters. In
essence the characteristic adolescent fallacy which the student
body has promoted has been the sophomoric line, “You give me
the freedom, and I'll take the responsibility.” The percentage
of the student body which has turned its attention to “re
sponsibility” in any facet of student government is minute.

@ The “I've go it, I've got it ...— You take it” syndrome
is everywhere. A case in point is the experience the English de-
partment had when it turned to its majors for suggestions con-
cerning the subjects for seminars this year. It seemed that the
department had received quite a few requests from students
who wished to propose various topics for seminars they wished
to take in the fall and spring of this year. Yet last year when
meetings of majors were planned, few of the over 50 majors
in the department attended, thus leaving the choice for the
seminars in the hands of a small student group and the Eng-
lish faculty. This syndrome has its roots in the reasoning: “I
want to have the option to participate in proposing a course of
collective action, but that the option, once available, can be
exercised by someone else since | probably won't have the
time.”

@ Perhaps a great percentage of the W&L student body
would be just as happy if they were attending a trade school in
the Shenandoah Valley with the name Washington and Lee
Institute. We sense that the predominant attitude of the stu-
dent body (the law school excepted) approaches its course
each term with as much enthusiasm as a man with a pick axe
who is confronted with a patch of ground in which he knows
he must dig a hole. Maybe students would extract more enjoy-
ment from their college days Working with their hands in a
metal shop instead of sitting at a desk studying texts and
notes which seem to have no immediate bearing on his past, his
present and his murky future, Some students probably wouldn't
mind a trade school education—as long as they continued to
have financial support from their parents, But that belongs in
our final observation and our conclusive advice to the student
body....

@ Students of Washington and Lee, these are the best
years of your lives, Don't waste your time studying or voting
in elections, or even walking up to the Hill. Spring is here now,
you've just got your money for March from your parents, so
go out and buy some beer, take a road trip, then go out into the
hinterlands. Spend money— it’s not yours, so what do you
care? And spring is “in” this year, so don't waste your time

(Editor’s note: The following are the results of the Honor System Survey
which was taken last fall, The Executive Committee has finally released its
contents to The Ring-tum Phi more than three months after the survey was
taken. Deletions have been made in the survey due to improper wording
which caused contradictory results. It should also be noted that only 337 of
the student body responded to the survey, representing a sector of student
opinion, but certainly not a majority,

The EC will publish an interpretation of this survey next week; the
group might also propose several changes in the Honor System as a result of
this poll and present them for a student body referendum,

One main result gleaned from the poll is that this section of Washington
and Lee students which the EC studied is in favor of the absolute penalty and
the existence of an Honor System at this University.)

QUESTIONS

A. Geographical Distribution Yes No

1. Do you feel that any violation of the consensus 111 203
Honor System should be dealt with regardless
of geographical location? (i.e., theft in any
other city or state in U.S.)

2. Do you feel that a violation occuring in ar- 183 117
other country during the short term of 12-12-6
should be considered by the Executive Com-
mittee?

3. Do you feel that the jurisdiction of the Honor 174 136
System should be delineated so as to include
only a limited geographical area?

4. Do you feel that the jurisdiction of the Honor 153 166
System should be confined to violations occur-
ing on the W&L campus or in the immediately
surrounding area?

5. Do you feel that the Honor System should 85 233
apply only to the W&L campus?
6. Do you feel that any restriction placed on the 136 190

geographical applicability of the Honor System
will serve to undermine or defeat the purpose
the purpose of that system?
7. As opposed to strictly geographical guidelines, 220 95
do you feel that the following criteria is ap-
propriate?
‘Any act perpetuated by a student, represent-
ing himself to be a W&L student and as a re-
sult receiving special consideration, which is
a violation of the Honor System should be
dealt with by the Executive Committee.’
B. Time Jurisdiction
1. The Honor System at present may be applicable 172 138
to a student throughout his academic career.
(From the time of initial registration until his
termination of his status as a student, i.e., gra-
duation or withdrawal). Do you feel that such
application of the Honor System is appropriate?

2. Do you feel that the Honor System should be 126 188
applicable throughout each calendar year?

3. Do you feel that the Honor System should be 194 109
applicable only during each adcademic year?

4. Should the academic year be defined so as to 123 177
include vacations?

5. Do you feel that such definition and/or limita- 113 191

tion of the duration of coverage of the Honor
System is contrary to the spirit or intent of the
system?
C. Jurisdiction as to Lying—Cheating—Stealing
1. At the present time any instance of “lying, 228 78
cheating, or stealing” is considered to be a
breach of the Honor System. The Honor System
of W&L is based on a sole principle: “a man
shall conduct himself as a gentleman at all
times.” Because the system is based on such a
principle, it cannot be specifically codified in
every respect. Do you feel that such a basis for
the Honor System is presently viable in rela-
tion to today’s society?
. Do you feel that the Honor System should be 57 257
limited in application to academic matters only?

tw

3. Do you feel that written work (i.e., term papers, 154 148
themes) should be considered as cold?
4. Do you feel that cold tests-quizzes should be 259 47

excluded from the aegis of the Honor System,
as is now the present procedure?
D. Open or Closed Trials
1. At present time honor trials are closed to the 231 150
student body at large. Do you feel that this is
the most appropriate procedure?

2. Do you feel instead that these trials should be 64 249
open to the student body from inception?
3. If you are in favor of an open trial procedure, 153 69

do you feel that the E.C. should retain the pre-
rogative to close the hearing for special consid-
erations and/or deliberations?
4. Do you feel that an open trial would serve an 92 180
educational and/or therapeutic purpose for the
student body?

E. Procedure for Notification of Other Schools as to

Honor Violation

1. Do you feel that there should be any notifica- 50 254
tion—other than to the parents of a convicted
student—as to violation of the Honor System?

2. At the present time, conviction of an honor vio- 148 166
lation does result in notation being made upon
the convicted student's transcript. The notifica-
tion reads ‘that the student has withdrawn from
the University without official permission’. Upon
inquiry the University will inform another
school as to the reason for withdrawal and as to
the exact nature of the honor violation, Do
you feel that this is proper procedure?

3. If there is notation made on the transcript, do 109 173
you feel that such information should ‘be sup-
plied voluntarily?

F. Past Conviction Procedure

1. Do you feel that a student found guilty of an 154 150
honor violation should be required to sever all
connections with the University and leave the
campus within a 24-hour period (the above rep-
resents the present procedure)?

2. If a student is found guilty of an honor viola- 178 224
tion, do you feel that he should be required to
spend the ensuing night in lodging off campus
in the company of several members of the Exe-
cutive Committee (the above represents the pre-

sent procedure)?
G. Penalty
i, Do you feel that the absolute penalty is essen- 173 145
tial to the continuance of a viable honor system?
2. Do you feel that there should be an absolute 224 91
penalty?
3. If adoption of some form of graduation of 38 275

penalties were to lead to the administration and
faculty taking over administration of the Honor
System, do you feel that such an Honor System
would be desirable?

4. Do you feel that in the event of a system en- 205 100
compassing graduation of penalties that the
E.C, should have the prerogative to determine
what would be the appropriate penalty for each
particular violation?

s if you feel that the E.C. should be granted this 185 65
discretionary power, then do you feel it proper
to base such a determination partially upon the
integrity witnessed during the actual trial? (i.e.,
a person who voluntarily confesses his guilt
might be hled in a different light than a stu-
dent who perjures himself before the Com-
mittee).

6. Do you feel that it is feasible to have an honor 48 261
system which has no penalty other than public
censure and/or dissemination of facts concern-

; a the violation?

Editor On Spence, ROTC

Stevens” Letter
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

My remarks here are addressed to
the column written by Mr. Spence.
Mr. Spence advocates reducing the
penalty for an honor violation in
certain cases. (e.g. If he is ever tried.)
However, there is something wrong
with his thinking. His assessment of
the three major elements of the
Honor System is, although incom-
plete, entirely correct.

However, as he proceeds with his
comments, he seems to forget what
he said just a moment before. But
we will get to that later. True, the
Honor System is a “dying institu-
tion,” but it is dying not because of
the ukimate penalty but because of
a change in student attitudes toward
honor. The decline in the Honor
Sysiem has come to this schoo! in
the company of a decline in a “gen-
tlemanly” attitude toward other peo-
ple, which used to guide a WAL stu-
dent's conduct.

Mr. Spence is crazy if he thinks
the students of twenty years ago did
not “pass judgment” on a potential
honor violation before turning some-
one in. He must have in order to de-
cide whether it was a possible honor
violation, He probably did this un-
consciously.

The problem now rests in the fact
that not only are students more in-
clined to knugh in the face of the
Honor System and say to themselves,
“that makes it all the easier,” but
peer pressure is against turning
someone in even for the most flag-
rant honor violation, This is the
same attitude that marks the break-
down in the laws of our cities, states,
and country, This is the same type of
thinking that prompts the quote, “all
nares Ought to be shot,”

Mr. Spence forgets that the EC
(or Honor Council) has the ex officio
power to do as # sees fit with Honor
cases. Kt can, by virtue of its “secret”
wutonomy, treat each individual case
us it sees fit, and has recourse to

seemed to recognize this fact in his
assessment of the three chief ele-
ments of the Honor System, but not
here.

A few final comments on the
Honor System are in order. As | see
it, the ultimate penalty insures a per-
son who, for one reason or another,
has something to do with a W&L
graduate that he is a man of honor,
For that reason, the honor system
should not be restricted to this camp-
us or the period of the school year.
It should apply to all students at all
times, from enrollment to gradua-
tion or withdrawal.

Washington and Lee should de-
mand honor of its students. Any stu-
dent who cannot be considered hon-
orable under the Honor Code has
no business being a Washington and
Lee student,

Carl Stevens

Back To ROTC...

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Phere have been many points rais-
ed on the ROTC question here on
campus, but in all the confusion the
most important ones seem to have
been overlooked, The issue will not
be decided on the academic merits
of ROTC but on the nature of the
Reserve Officers Training Program
itself,

The most constructive criticiem
advanced at the ROTC forum (which
the Phi didn't even see fit to cover)
concerned the fact that the ROTC
Dept. is the only Department on
campus not open to any interested
student. What I mean is that you
cannot take a ROTC course as an
elective—-you can't even audit one
lt is a foranembers-only group, This
seems to est it apart from the resi
of the University and separate it out
for special attention. This type of ex-
chusive closed program is hardly in
line with the concepts of academic
freedom and intellectual curiosity

which define the academic commun-
ity.

It was coach Nonman Lord who
first brought this up, so don't write
it off as “left-wing trickery.” He was
upset to learn that ROTC excludes
“non-majors” completely. | made a
direct oral request to Col. Mortis,
Dept. head, for permission to audit
the course, assuring him | would not
ibe “disruptive.” He refused, saying:
“We have a product to sell and the
presence of any outsider (?) would
hamper our selling it to regular stu-
dents.” This smacks of mind mani-
pulation. Col. Morris consistently re-
ferred to ROTC as a “training”
course, which is quite different from
an “education” course. Even the
business and computer courses are
educational, not “training.”

But my biggest complaint about

ROTC is exactly the point raised
most often to defend it—academic
(here meaning from a student's point
of view) freedom. A ROTC student
does not have the individual free-
doms deemed so essential to the pur-
suit of truth and knowledge.
ROTC students may not question
the subject matter they are being
taught or the value of the military
establishment without suffering dis-
iplinary action, They are not free to
pursue their interests, No attempt is
made to cover or even consider the
miihary philosophy and history of
Mao Tse-Tung or Ho Ohi Minh or
Che Guevara, The army will not
permit such “intellectual freedom.”
And the army decides what ROTC
can or cannot do, can or cannot
teach. ROTC students have been dis-

BY MARC SMALL

The rejection of the proposed
Constitution by the Student Body
last week did more than postpone or
forestall the creation of a student
senate on this campus: it also gave a
new lease on life to one of the most
enjoyable parts of W&L tradition.

Article Il, Section B (1.) of the
Old Constitution (the one still in
effect) calls for election of a Fancy
Dress President—an office many of
us had thought defunct when the
Dance Board decided not to hold a
‘Fancy Dress Ball this year. While
it is a moot point whether Fancy
Dress would return without a presi-
dent—and there have been active
forces attempting to bring about its
resurrection—it is a definite boon
for its advocates to have a person
formally designated as the organizer.

The Dance Board has had great
problems over the past three years—
changing student preferences in
music, declining sales in Dance plans,
and a more manifest apathy toward
activities of this sort. However, the

“Conservative”
Is Rejuvenated

“The Southern Conservative,” a
political opinion magazine published
during the 1960s, has been resurrect-
ed by two students and will resume
publication this week.

Supported by private donations,
the “Conservative” will appear every
other month for the remainder of
the current academic year, accord-
ing to William H. Miller Il, its edi-
tor.

The new periodical is a joint pro-
ject of Miller, a leader of Washing-
ton and Lee’s campus chapter of
Young Americans for Freedom, and
Greg C. Raetz of the Conservative
Society. In a statement of editorial
purpose, they said the “Conserva-
tive” is designed “to provide a rea-
soned, literate and sophisticated al-
ternative to the ‘counter-culture.’ ”

According to Miller, crucial sup-
port for the new “Southern Conser-
vative” has come from Rep. Philip
Crane (R.-lll.), a prominent House
conservative who visited Washing-
ton and Lee as part of the “Contact
1971” symposium last month.

Through A Spyglass Darkly .. .

De Cursu Honorum

aes

demise of Fancy Dress was not a
pretty thing: it would have been far
more desirable to have had it for-
mally voted out of existence than to
have it so miserably ignored as it
was during the Big Five elections a
year ago. Perhaps Fancy Dress is no
longer wanted at W&L—and from
the turn-out my freshman and sopho-
more years I find that quite hard to
‘believe—but if such is the case, then
a concerted drive to abolish it is
more healthy than allowing it to
strangle on with no hope of re-
covery.

It is a possibility that my whole
article is in vain: if there are no
candidates this year, then the chances
of bringing it back are that much
smaller. At the time of this writing,
though, I have been approached by
one eager and interested person who
was ‘busily getting his petition filled
out, and it is likely that the first page
of the “Phi” you now read will list
one or more students who give a
damn to keep a worthwhile tradition
alive,

Many things could be done to
Fancy Dress: perhaps, as Bill Wil-
liams, Law Freshman and last year’s
VMI Dance Chairman, has suggest-
ed, co-ordinating it with VMI, bring-
ing in more money and more people,
perhaps making the Dance Board's
finances an assessment in our tui-
tion, as is the “Phi” or the “Calyx,”
perhaps revitalizing it was more
modern formats and groups, or, per-
haps, returning to the Masked Ball
of the past. The ideas are myriad,
and are not really the concern of this
writer. Rather, it is my belief that a
sincere vote and a sincere candidate
may produce that wonder of won-
ders on par with the five-cent nickel
and the one-hundred cent dollar:
the preservation of a piece of our
heritage that a good number of the
(University Community — students,
faculty, and townspeople, enjoyed
and felt was deserving of the com-
munity’s support.

The decision is not mine alone,
but ours. If there are candidates—
and I am sure that at least one will
appear—then it would speak well of
a CONCERNED student body to
climb out of their dorms and apart-
ments to vote in a responsible per-
son to what once had been an office
of great merit at this school. Fancy
Dress may yet live again—but only
if we give a damn and give a vote.

Letters
To the Editor

Students Only!

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

In the past few months, the use
of university facilities by unauthoriz-
ed people has become extremely an-
noying .These people, usually any-
where from kindergarten to high
school, make free use of the student
center and gym in great numbers,
especially on weekends.

The average crowd in the game
and television rooms fluctuates be-
tween ten and 30 on weekends and
in somewhat smaller numbers dur-
ing the week. Since the gameroom
and gym are used on a first come
first served basis, the students often
find themselves in direct competi-
tion with these people for the use of
the facilities.

The destruction of things such as
ping-pong tables and pin ball ma-
chines is also part of my complaint.
I don't think the young “townies”
can be blamed for all of the destruc-
tion, because the students do their
share, but certainly they do some of
it, and at the expense of the students
and university.

I feel that these university owned
and student financed areas should be
for the use of the college community
only, and that some policy should
be agreed upon by either the Smu-
dent Center Committee or the EC
concerning this problem. It seems to
me that the university and students
do enough for the town without hav-
ing to provide the university facili-
ties as a playground for the Lexine-
ton “youngsters.”

is an insightful commentary on the
University’s academic complexion.

The report shows that of 889 I
grades taken at the end of the
strike-semester of 1970, 77 were A,
240 B, 248 C, 115 D, and 150 F.
Although a large percentage of I
grades were recorded as D and F,
the percentages of those grades in
the second semester grade record are
not significantly changed.

Enrollment during the 1969-70
year decreased slightly in spite of
the fact that entering freshmen
classes (both law and undergraduate)
increased slightly. The enrollment
breakdown was as follows: 1001
Arts and Sciences, 249 Commerce,
185 Law, and 16 Independent Scho-
lars and Special Students. Total:
1451.

Total enrollment for the current
year is the highest ever, over 1500.
In 1948 W&L boasted 800 under-
graduate students.

WA&L had just one more summa
cum laude graduate, five, than in
1959, 14 magna’s and 46 cum’s.

The trend is for higher grades to
awarded the second semester, 106
students made the Honor Roll first
semester, 146 the second; 33 made
all A's first semester, 47 the second;
316 made Dean's List first semester,
423 the second. Of all grades given
in the second semester 21% were A,
36.8 B, 27.9 C, 6.8 D and 3.4 F.
The Fine Arts department awarded
the most A’s, 221; Military Science
awarded the highest percentage of
A's, 66%. Among the larger depart-
ments, Philosophy gave the highest
percentage of F's, 7%.

At the end of the first semester
last year 69 students were on acade-
mic probation, the lowest in four
years, although at the same time, the
largest number in four years fell
into the shadow of the automatic
rule, 23. As the automatic rule was
suspended for the second semester,
similar statistics for it are not avail-
able.

Of 322 ‘baccalaureate degrees
awarded, 74 were majors in History,
46 in Law, 38 in Business Admini-
stration and 22 in Boonomies.

BY JEFFREY B. SPENCE

Two weeks ago this column raised
the issue of the way the present
‘Honor System seems to be going. It
was pointed out that there seems to
‘be a reluctance on the part of stu-
dents today to uphold the system
with the same vigor they have in the
past. One of the main reasons point-
ed out was the harshness of the ulti-
mate penalty. The alternative offer-
ed was to add to the ultimate pen-
alty another penalty of a lesser na-
ture in the form of a one year su-
spension, rather than permanent ex-
ipulsion, Well, as do all opinions, this
one has drawn some objection. How-
ever, the way this objection has been
voiced is curious.

if you read the Letters to the Edi-
tor in this issue, you will find the
objection I refer to penned under the
name of a Mr. Carl Stevens. Mr. Ste-
vens seems to think that I wrote my
article of a fortnight ago purely out
of self interest. Since I have never
violated the Honor System, nor do
I ever intend to I resent the implica-
tion of what Mr. Stevens has said in
his letter,

Furthermore, I find this young
man’s choice of words quite distaste-
ful in his statement that, “Mr. Spence
is crazy if he thinks the students of
twenty years ago did not ‘pass judg-
ment’ on a potential honor violation
before turning someone in.” Mr.
Stevens may not agree with my point

bE
of view, (in fact 1 welcome criticism)
‘but hurling personal epithets is posi-
tively unmannerly. Since Mr. Ste-
vens is so worried that there is a gen-
eral breakdown of gentlemanly con-
duct maybe he ought to look to him-
self ‘before he casts the first stone at
anyone.

Mr. Stevens seems to be an advo-
cate of law and order both on camp-
us and throughout the United States.
Yet, right after he finishes telling us
that the breakdown of our Honor
System is just another symptom of
ithe lawless trend in our nation, he
turns an about face and advocates
awlessness on the part of the Exeou-
tive Committee. Obviously Mr. Ste-
vens has not read the pamphlet en-
titled, “The Honor System,“ which
‘was prepared by the E, C. of the
1968-69 session. This pamphlet ex-
plains some of the explicit restric-
tions on the E. C. as well as on the
witnesses or the defendant in the
case in question. The secrecy of the
trial is not to allow the E.C. to do
with a defendant what it wants but
rather to protect him from public
ridicule if he is found innocent. In
fact, the Executive Committee can-
not do what ever it pleases with any
case presented to it.

Mr. Stevens’ final claim to fame
on the Honor System question is that

Hoopsters Win CAC Tournament

The Generals have finally won the
battle, and the war is over, The bas-

considered a fanastic season, especi-
ally in lieu of the loss of last year’s

and then swept the CAC Tourna-

fully closed out the career of Lucky
Ol’ Doremus, with a win, The ball
club trailed for the large majority of
the game, but, as the critics say, re-

fused to fold. They were down by 11
with less than three minutes to play.
All seemed lost. But no! Out of the
sky came Super Skip. He quickly
brought the team back into conten-
tion, and Mike Daniel put in the ty-
ing bucket, to send the game into
overtime.

As all good stories end, so does
this one. Super Skip is not to be stop-
ped. He pulls eight points from
somewhere on his \person, and with
the help of Ellie Gutshall’s last sec-
ond shot grabs victory from the jaws
of defeat. A suitable victory for a

Cinderella team. But Paul McLure
and his dwarfs will be back next
year,

So the Generals proceed to the
big tournament. Of course, this is the
year when everyone plans to take the
championship away from the Blue.
Had W&L, who had won the CAC
Tournament for 3 of the last 4
years ,not lost: two All-Americans?
Yes... But, this ball club still had
something to prove to a still disbe-
lieving public. They did so, They
breezed through both games, playing
everyone in both contests. The final
game was not even close, as the Gen-
erals breezed by with an 85-71 vic-
tory.

Notice

There will be a meeting of the
Washington and Lee Ecology Club
on Thursday, March 4 at 8:30 in
room 112 of the Student Union
Building.

“We are not trying to rebuild for
a new era. We have begun that new
era.” As to next year’s chances for
W&L in taking the tournament.
Coach Canfield succinctly put it on
the line—‘We plan on it.”

Congratulations are extended to
Mike Daniel, the tournament's Most
Valuable Player and also All-OAC,
and to Paul MeoLure, who joined
Mike on the All-CAC team. Paul,
according to his coach, played the
best game that any big man has play-
ed around here in quite a while. His
statistics will not be printed in this
issue, as they were so amazing that ]
must check the Sports Information
Department about them.

The Tournament was the success-
ful climax of a season of hardwork.
Che General defense worked beauti-
fully throughout the Tournament.

A 17-8 record isn’t bad for a team
that just rated a “Generals Rebuild-
ing” title from its own newspaper at
the beginning of the year. Congratu-
lations to all.

  

LaRue’s Press Box

After the events of the past week-
end, a few notable campus dwellers
have gotten their adding machines
and final CAC standings out to see if
Washington and Lee has a chance in
1971 to win the Big Bell. Perhaps a
history course for the Class of 1974
is in order,

Briefly, the Big Bell is the gift of
the Norfolk and Western Railroad
and is the College Athletic Confer-
ence’s symbol of the best all around
jock school. Points are accumulated
according to each institution’s stand-
ing in the intercollegiate activities—
football, cross country, ‘basketball,
swimming, wrestling, baseball, golf,
tennis, and track. The school with
the most points at the end of the
year wins The Bell, the CAC’s high-
est honor,

The Generals enhanced their posi-
tion fantastically, as the basketball
and swimming teams both won their
respective championships and the
wrestling squad tied for seoond with

Oldtimers Fall Victim To Varsity 33-20

Washington and Lee's Varsity
Football Team, under the tutelage of
Head Coach Buck Leslie, wound up
its spring practice session with high
hopes for next season after ripping
an Alumni squad loaded with former
standouts, 33-20. A crowd of several
hundred fans, many of them return-
ing alumni, watched the encounter
on Wilson Field.

Steve Fluharty, the Generals’ quar-
terback who began last autumn on
the bench and wound wp as a Little
All America candidate, was, as ex-
pected, the big gun for the Varsity,
and he quickly ignited the high scor-
ing affair with a touchdown pass to
Chappy Conrad. Doug Chase, the
Generals’ Lexingtonian field goal
kicker, drilled home the extra point
for a 7-0 lead,

Jim Farrar, who played a key role
for the Varsity last year when only a

freshman, carried on a one yard
plunge for the second Varsity touch-
down and a 13-0 spread on the next
ball possession. Fluharty then de-
monstrated his versatility as a quar-
terback by scampering off on a 23
yard touchdown run in the second
quarter which, coupled with another
Chase kick, built up a 20-0 lead.

Outstanding all afternoon was the
Generals’ defensive platoon, but iper-
haps their most outstanding play
came midway through the period
when they barged in to block an
Alumni punt and recovered it in the
end zone for a touchdown. Lane
Nalley, a linebacker, got credit for
the TD.

Bruce Green, who converted many
passes into touchdowns while star-
ring for the Generals at his flanker
position, came up with the initial
Alumni touchdown, late in the first
half.

Green hauled in a nine yard pass
from Jack Baizley, the backup quar-
terback on the 1969 squad. Baizley
would later sprint three yards for a
final touchdown, in addition to exe-
cuting a two point conversion play.

With Leslie checking out various
combinations of his squad in the sec-
ond half, the hot scoring hand of the
Opening stanzas simmered. Rising
junior quarterback Tom Van Am-
burgh did combine with halfback
Bill Wallace on a twenty five yard
scoring pitch, however.

Doug Gossmann, an outstanding
blocker while an undergraduate,
completed the Alumni scoring with
a one yard burst.

The contest as a whole proved to
be an outstanding success, Aside

St. Louis based Washington ‘by just
five points and out distances third

W&L’s chances to return the bell
to Lexington appear to be fair to
good. But the race is sure to be close
and the Generals must consistently
place near the top in the four re-
maining spring sports. The Wash-
ington Bears have a tough record in
these activities, as last year’s Spring
Sports Carnival seems to indicate.

Washington won baseball and
grabbed second place in tennis. WU
also copped third place in golf, but
could only get fourth ranking in
track. However an added incentive
and a definite advantage for the
Bears is the fact that they host this
year’s Spring Sports Tournament.

_ And speaking of bells, congratula-
tions are in order to all three Wash-
ington and Lee squads who perform-
ed so well. Coach Verne Canfield’s
hardcourt hustlers won their second
straight OAC championship and
their fourth in the past five cam-
paigns. And over in the VMI tank,
Coach Bill Stearns guided the Gen-
eral aquanauts to another first place
finish. The two smaller replicas of
The Bell, awarded to champions in
individual sports, will be welcome
additions to the trophy case.

Meanwhile, newcomer Roy Skin-
net coached his grapplers to a tie for
the number two spot in the final
CAC wrestling ranks,

Hence the Generals will have to
count on the Spring athletes to
round up the points needed to get
the Bell back. Trailing 95-90, W&L
faces a strong ‘but beatable Washing-
ton University crowd,

Swimmers Capture CAC,
Finish Second In State

Chalk up one more successful
year to W&L swimming. For the
past 30 years or so, General swim
teams have always preserved win-
ning seasons. This year’s squad tal-
lied a 5-4 dual meet record as well as
a second in the state and a first in
the conference. It was the third time
in five years that the CAC trophy
was presented to Coach Bill Stearns,
and the future looks even more pro-
mising.

The state meet was held Febru-
ary 19 and 20 at Norfolk. Leading
the Generals to their second place
finish were, Bill Brumback, 50 and
100 freestyle champion, Bim Clark
100 and 200 fly winner, Alan Cor-
with, 200 freestyle winner, and Steve
Erikson, 100 backstroke champion.
The 400 freestyle relay team of Cor-
with, Clark, Brumback and Owen

Sharp captured the remaining Wash-

Leads Matmen In CAC

Captain Dee Copenhaver captured
first place in the 177-lbs. division.
Teammates Bill Melton and Jim
Stieff placed first at 134 Ibs. and 150
Ibs., respectively.

Sewanee placed four conference
champions. Washington University
equalled the Generals with three.

Freshman Bill Melton provided an
exciting match in the finals when he
won a judges’ decision, overtime vic-
tory over highly touted, two-time
champ Yogi Anderson of Sewanee.

Melton and Anderson were tied
3-3 at the end of regulation time,
each scoring a takedown and an es-
cape. During the three one-minute
overtime periods, Melton made sev-
eral attempts at a takedown. The
judges awarded him the victory on
the basis of aggressiveness.

At 150 lbs., freshman Jim Steiff
upset top-seeded Billings of Sewanee.
After looking strong in the semi-
final matches, Steiff started slowly
against Billings. Stieff managed a
hard ride and a takedown on his op-
ponent; but Billings managed to es-
cape in the third period. Stieff pre-
vented Billings from getting a take-
down to clinch the victory.

Senior Dee Copenhaver capped
an outstanding career by winning
one of the toughest classes in the
tournament, Copenhaver, twice
champ at 190 Ibs., drapped to 177 to

After pinning his man in the semi-
finals, Copenhaver faced Elder of
Sewanee, who entered the champion-
ship with a 12-1-1 record. Copen-
haver secured a takedown and rode
Elder out in the second period; and
Elder managed a reversal. Copen-
haver got an escape and secured a
victory.

Freshman Craig Hankins received
first seed at 126 Ibs. After pinning

were new state records.

Last weekend, the CAC confer-
ence meet convened at VMI. It turn-
ed out to be no contest. The Gen-
erals racked up 185 points, followed
by Sewanee, 125, Washington, 63,
Centre, 42, and Southwestern, 19.

Bight of 17 firsts fell to the power
of the Blue.

Bill Brumback captured his two
specialities, the 50 and 100 free-
style. Clark won the 100 fly, Bert
Meem captured the 200 fly and
Alan Corwith won the 400 freestyle.
The 400 medley relay, composed of
Erickson, Clark, Brumiback and Rick
Sands, the 400 freestyle relay of
Sharp, Corwith, Clark, and Brum-
back, and the 800 freestyle relay of
Sharp, Lawlor, Corwith and Brum-
back, all nan away with first places.

Three individuals in five events
have qualified for the Nationals on
March 19 and 20. Brumiback, Clark,
and Erickson will attempt to continue
the fine success that W&L swimmers
have had at this meet in recent years.
Brumback, already an All America,
was also named as co-winner of the
outstanding swimmer award at the
CAC meet.

With an eye to the future, Coach
Stearns sees a very promising squad.

Although losing a two-time All
America, Bill Brumback, to gradua-
tion, the Generals have a few top
high school swimmers waiting in the
wings. These individuals could well
turn out to be All Americans them-
selves. The return of an entire group
of seniors next year, will make for
an experienced team and will assure
W&L of nothing less than excep-
tional swimming.

his career here at school. If our self-
appointed savior of the Honor Sys-
tem fears its total destruction so
much then why does he advocate
that which will make the system
breakdown because of unmanagabil-
ity?

Mr. Sievens sure seems to be up-
set. His letter set me to wondering
who he was, so I investigated. The
Registrar does not seem to have him
on the rolls as a student here at
WA&L. His name does not aippear in
our student directory, nor for that
matter in the local Lexington tele-
phone directory. Thus, I checked to
see if he has ever been a student,
Well, according to the secretary at
the Alumni House, he has never
been a student here at W&L either
as an undergraduate or a law stu-
dent! One wonders then, who the
mysterious Mr, Carl Stevens is?

At this point I still don’t know.
Either he is someone with no con-
nection in his life that links him with
Washington and Lee or, he does not
exist. If he does not exist then who
wrote the letter? I certainly hope it
was not one of our own students
who lacked the nerve to sign his own
name, which by the way is an act of
lying. Therefore would the real Carl
Stevens please stand up, since as
every law and order advocate knows,
a man has a right to face his accuser,

iplined for participation in anti-war
activities—thus limiting their free-
dom to dissent and even freedom of
speech. A W&L ROTC student was
lectured and warned for daring to
sign the petition to remove ROTC
credit. Col. Morris is guilty of dup-
licitty.

ROTC students may not dress ex-
pressly but must wear uniforms
(‘uniforms regiment the mind as
well as the appearance”). They may
not let their hair grow long or wear
beards, or even long sideburns. And
Col. Morris dares use the word “free-
dom” to defend the department!

The point is that ROTC is not
commensurate with a university at-
mosphere and should not have uni-
versity credit. In fact, I think it
shouldn’t be here at all. I call upon
the University to remove ROTC
from campus and wpon the students

American Freedom

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

A few comments on last week’s
Through a Spyglass Darkly .. .
column “On Freedom”,

I agree whole-heartedly with the
first part of Mr. Small’s article. In
my opinion his analysis of the state
of American society today replete
with its dissipation of individual li-
berty, its lack of true leadership, and
its semi-blindness to the ideals of op-
portunity and freedom as our pri-
mary national goals was quite cor-
rect.

However, | strongly disagree with
his labelling of a “basic presumption
of human charity” as an unrealistic
supposition of the “revolutionary ni-
hilists of the radical movement.”
Quite to the contrary! The collecti-
vist philosophy of today’s radical

LETTERS TQ THE EDUTOR

movement, like the Fabian philoso-
phy of the Old Left, is a blatant con-
tradiction of the ideal of human
chanity. Both of these philosophies
are but versions of the age old myth
of statism—a philosophy wherein
mankind as a whole is too perverted,
too stupid, and too innately greedy
and self-centered to care about his
fellow man or even to know what is
good for his own well-being.

Thus the statist envisions a gov-
ernment being set up by an Enlight-
ened few (who know such things)
which would then show man what is
“right” and force him to become
“charitable”. But this is in itself a
negation of the idea of charity, as
charity (being a form of love) is a
voluntary act of the human will.
One can be forced neither to love
nor to be charitable.

When government seeks to be the
administrator of charity (as in the
collectivist or welfare state) the in-
dividual loses sight of his personal
duty toward his brother, thinking
that this responsibility has been as-
sumed by the State and is thus no
longer his real concern.

From a libertarian point of view,
1 believe that man through the in-
fluence of religion will, as an indivi-
dual, pay attention to rights (“life
liberty, and pursuit of happiness”—
happiness as he himself sees it) will
recognize and strive to guarantee
these same freedoms and opportuni-
ties to his fellow man and will come
to his assistance sohuld he be in
need. This is in my opinion the true
meaning of freedom. We in America
once made a start down this path,
but we have since wandered off. It is
high time that we find that path
again!

2000 years ago the essence of char-
ity was summed up in eleven words
— “Do unto others as you would
have others do unto you.” Our prob-
lem is not that this philosophy has
failed, but rather that it has never
been completely tried,

Ecology Notice
To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Have you ever heard of a litter-
picking party? This W&L first, aimed
at cleaning up the scenic Goshen
Pass, will take place on Saturday,
March 6 at 10 a.m. Consider this a
call for all men, women, and chil-
dren to come to the aid of their
country by helping us in the fight

PPoint:
On Honor System

(Continued from Page 1)
ington and Lee students have long
taken for granted the maxim that “a
man shall conduct himself as a gen-
tleman at all times.” Certainly the
long-standing principle has been held
in good stead down through the
years, yet the key to its position of
reverence was a general consensus as
to the word “honor.”

One can no longer engage In
mulling over the relevance of hon-
orable conduct without first inquit-
ing as to another's concept of “what
is honorable conduct?” Every ume
a student faction or group OF indivi-
dual on campus infringes upon an-
other student's rights by interfering
with the educational process, every
time a student comes before the Exe-
cutive Committee and pleads his case
on the grounds that an obviously dis-
honest act is to be condoned, be-
cause his peer group views such acti-
vity as acceptable, and every time
there is a recurrence of such acts as
iMegal long distance phone calls
without apparent concern on the stu-
dents’ behalf, then there is adequate
reason to believe that there has been
a breakdown in consensus over what
should be upheld as honorable con-
duct. Yet on the questionnaire the
students who responded gave an
overwhelming affirmation 228 to 78,
in favor of preserving the absolute
sanctity of the principle of honorable
conduct.

A logical progression from the
above is that students today at Wash-
ington and Lee feel that the most ap-
propriate course of action is to live
by one’s own personal moral ethic.
One student suggested that in so do-
ing each individual should have the
discretion whether or not to turn in
another person for breaching his per-
sonal code of conduct. ;

Such a philosophy is certainly in
keeping with the gradual process of
fragmentation which is draining the
university of a great degree of
the Honor System's distinctive char-
acter and personality.

Most assuredly, the sentiment ex-
hibited in favor of codifying the pre-
sent system of include an alternate
penalty of a one year suspension is
indicative of a lack of concurrence
over the relevance and significance
of honorable conduct.

The final question on the survey
was worded, “Do you as an indivi-
dual favor the existence of Honor
System at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity?”

The vote was conclusively affirma-
tive by the margin of 295 to 15, Yet
the perhaps subconcious omission of
either the adjective an or the really
served to render the results incon-
clusive. | myself am now only assur-
ed that the consensus of the student
body is in favor of some form of
honor system .. . and that it cer-
tainly is not related whatsoever lo
that Honor System which our prede-
cessors and the founders of Wash-
ngton and Lee so cherished and
adored, and lived by.

some procedure that will allow these
people to get involved,” he said.

There was some discussion as to
whether or not the freshman class
ought to have representation on the
Council, Rich Murray commented
that someone familiar with dormi-
tory problems should be included.

It was finally decided, by a vote
of 8-2, that the University Council
consist of four seniors, three juniors,
two sophomores, one freshman, and
two Law students. The Student Body
President shall also be included.

Petitions for positions on the Uni-
versity Council, bearing 50 names,
must be submitted by the time bal-
lots are counted for the General
Election of March 22. Balloting for
the University Council representa-
tives will be held on March 25,
along with the General Election
run-offs. Election to these positions
will be by a plurality of votes cast.

No action was taken concerning
the insertion of the University Coun-
cil into the present Student Body
Constitution. The E.C. also rejected
a suggestion to put the new Constitu-
tion up to referendum again, reason-
ing that it would be unfair for the
present student body to pass a new
governmental structure that could
not go into effect until the academic
year 1972-73,

U 8
IN JOINT

On Officers

BY GLENN AZUMA

There are few things which are
less flattering than to be told that
you are a person's second choice. It
‘was in this manner that the follow-
ing column space became available
to me. I was told that it was origin-
ally intended for the new Student
Body President, but with that race
still undecided I was the next best
thing.

This newspaper issue which comes
at the heels of a primary and on the
evening before a final election should
be, I suppose, concerned with the na-
ture of student government. Such
stuff is hardly interesting, especially
since it has been repeated time and
again during the campaign. Perhaps,
what I can do is give my thoughts on
the type of people who run for office
in student government. I speak strict-
ly of my own motivations and hap-
pily my past election makes me feel
more seoure in their airing.

In general, | suppose we are am-
bitious men. Men who like to be
seen and heard and occasionally lis-
tened to. If nothing else student gov-
ernment is an excellent opportunity
for display. In this respect a strain of
egotism is present.

Yet, I believe it is not the domin-
ant force in the drive of people of
my type. The dominant force may
be simply the need to be active. The
peculiar role of student government
as an organ of representative appeal
rather than the holder of any indep-
endent power makes the attainment
of a goal all the more diffiowlt and
challenging. There is always the
hope that your work may result in
something lasting and good.

In a school of this size this is par-
tioularly potent as a motivating force
because One person or a group of
people can significantly alter the im-
mediate course of university life and
the more distant course of the uni-
versity as an educational and experi-
ential entity.

The problem of this activity is ob-
vious, for it is easy to define oneself
in terms of committee positions or
chairmanships or office. This is a
dangerous for such designations are
flimsy justification for an individual,
and titles are as worthless as the
paper upon which they are written.

Finally, student government may
require a significant strain of mas-
ochism. | think that my “colleagues”
will give me unanimous support in
this assertion. There are few events
more danynably boring than a fac-
ulty or student committee meeting
which can last for several hours on
ivsues Of such overriding importance
as to whether classes should begin
on Tuesday rather than Monday or
vice versa.

One's enthusiasm has a tendency
to diminish while tending the ballot
box in the cold of March at 8:00 in
the Freshman Quad. And you can
only conclude that accurate voting
records are a barbaric fetish of De-
moocracy when you have counted 800
ballots four times for a consistent
tally.

If it were only for incidents such
ws these student government could
not be termed a joke, Yet, I believe
that student activities at Washington
and Lee have substantially influenc-
ed the change which has ocourred in
the past several years. I believe we
have seen the increase in the qual-
ity of education and living here at

EC Seeks General Election Petitions;

Pledges On Examinations Discussed

The Executive Committee Mon-
day evening announced that petitions
for the second General election—
presidents and vice-presidents of
each class; Science, Liberal Arts, and
presidents; and
rising sophomore, junior, and senior
E.C. representatives—will be due by
Monday March 15 at 6 p.m.

In other business, the E.C. re-
jected a proposal submitted by Dr.
Robert McAhren for the faculty
E.C., strictly defining the pledge on
the independent exam envelopes.
The E.C. opted instead for a word-
ing change in the present pledge
which would preserve some of the

discretionary powers of the E.C. in

any judicial case that might arise
from a violation of such a pledge.

The Faculty version would have
prohibited any comment to be made
by a student about a final examina-
tion, including a “value judgment,”
an expression or remark concerning
the relative difficulty of the test. The
E.C, complained that, under such a
pledge, any conveyance as to charac-
ter of a test between one student or
another would necessarily always re-
sult in the invocation of the absolute
penalty, whether cheating was in-
volved or not.

“Under such strict codification,
the E.C. would have no function,”
said Jim Slay, senior Law representa-
tive. The E.C. emphasized that the
question of whether a student's com-
munication imparted aid to another
or not was basic to any honor pro-
ceeding that might occur.

Under the version sent to the Fac-
uity E.C. by the student Execoutive
Committee, the words “that impart
information” have been inserted to
the second provision of the pledge.
It would then read: “I will make no
comment about this examination
which imparts information except to
the course instructor until the end of
the entire examination period for all
students,”

Fran Lawrence stated the E.C

Troubs

The Troubadour Theatre will pre-
sent its third major production of
the current season next week from
Tuesday through Friday. The Troubs
will show five one-act plays with dif-
ferent programs on alternate even-
ings. This is something of a first in

E.C. functions in the spring. Law-
rence resolved to formulate some
procedure for transition that could
be implemented for a gradual usur-
pation of powers by the outgoing
members,

It was decided that the following
locations would be used for balloting
tomorrow's Big Five run-offs: fresh-
man quad, inside Washington Hall,
inside the Co-op, and inside Tucker
Hall.

Number 22

Glenn Azuma Wins;
Robinson and Weir
Compete Tomorrow

With a turnout of nearly 54%,
Steve Robinson and Don Weir were
thrown into a run-off Monday for
election to Student Body President.
Also in the run-off balloting, to be
held Thursday, will be the contest
between Rick Gray and Bruce Madi-
son for Student Body Secretary.

Glenn Azuma registered a decisive
victory over John Cassell for Vice-
President; Richard Middleton and
Brian Greig successfully fought off
opposition for the offices of Dance
Board V.P. and Fancy Dress Presi-
dent, respectively.

In the Presidential match, after
two recounts, it was found that Rob-
inson missed a majority by a shim
margin of three votes. The final tal-
lies were: Robinson-397, Weir-240,
and Tom Mays-159, Weir, who en-
tered the race after the petition dead-
line and ran as a write-in candidate,
will have his name on the ballot for
the Thursday run-off.

Amma swept to the Vice-Presi-
dential post with 556 votes to 234
for his opponent, John Cassell. The
vote totals in the three-way race for
Student Body Secretary were: Gray-
353, Madison-320, and Jim Davis-
107.

In the Dance Board contest Mid-
dleton bested sophomore Gary Polia-
koff, 402 to 321 votes. Greig topped
Paul Suthern for the Fancy Dress
leadership, 400 to 263.

Commenting on his plans for the
future of Fancy Dress, Greig said,

“It is basically my philosophy, and
some people seem generally attuned
to bringing it back in some form.”
He expressed hope that it would ap-
pear again, perhaps as a costume
ball.

In addition to the run-off elections
for the Big Five offices the IFC will
hold its elections Thursday, Candi-
dates for president are Bob LaRrue
and Bill Andrews. Running for vice-
president are Griff Steel and Ken
Evans.

Groups Seek
Student Help

Washington and Lee students will
have the opportunity to join local re-
sidents in “Doing Something For
Lexington” during the next month.

The Lexington-Rockbridge Jay-
cees are sponsoring the “Do Some-
thing” project and will circulate
pledge cards in behalf of different
organizations throughout the area.
The pledge cards will then be paired
with the needs of various agencies
im order to see that aid is funneled to
the proper channels.

The project will last for much of
the month and pledge cards will be
available at many outlets and stores
in Lexington.

about the same time it was held in
the past, the end of January. A sec

Hopefully we can spread this thing

Bert Meem, who will be the head
of the Dance Board next year, also

sounded optimistic whout the return

“The Boor,” which received wide
acclaim at the Moscow Art Theatre
lets the audience intrude on a self-

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Independent Exams: The Non-Problem

Remember the independent exams schedule which W&L
students began last fall? This spring may be the last time stu-
dents will have the chance to schedule their own exams, ac-
cording to one faculty member.

We're not being alarmists, It just so happens that in a poll
taken by the Executive Committee after the fall term exams,
71% of the 200 or so polled said that they had heard something
about their examination prior to their taking it. A much small-
er percentage said that they had heard references made by
other students to specific questions on an exam, The EC was
not happy. Neither was the faculty Executive Committee.

In fact, the faculty EC asked that the student body EC
take a hard look at the wording of the pledges appearing on
the envelopes used for the examinations. The pledges as they
were printed on the envelopes last fall read:

“I pledge that

“1. L have neither received nor given aid on this examina-
tion,

“2 | will make no comment about this examination and
will discuss it with no one other than the course instructor
until the end of the entire examination period for all students.

“3. I have heard no comment concerning and received no
information about the content of this examination from anyone
other than the course instructor. Any exceptions are listed
below.”

The controversy concerning the results of that EC poll and
the wording of the three pledges on the envelopes rages over
the differentiation between a value comment (i.e., made by
one student to another during the exam period which charac-
terizes the nature of the exam but does not reveal any informa-
tion on the questions the test might cover) and a substantive
comment (i.¢., one which reveals the content of a specific ques-
tion or area of questions).

The value comment would be something like, “That test
was really hard.” Here, no information about the content of
the exam is actually transferred from one student to another,
but the nature of the examination is leaked. Thus, a student
hearing a value comment might be able to direct his study toa
specific area which the course covers, realizing that that ma-
terial would be the hardest and consequently emphasized on
the exam,

The substantive comment (“Better check over the Napoleo-
nic War carefully before your exam”) reveals the actual ma-
terial covered in an exam and is more or less the answer to
the inferences in the value comment.

Dr. Robert McAhren submitted a suggested revision to the
Executive Committee which would make the wording of the
pledge on the envelope more explicit. The EC turned down
that proposed rewrite Monday evening. And rightly so.

The answer to the present independent examination pledges
is not in their inability to convey to the student his responsibil-
ity not to reveal any information about exams. Read the
pledges that appeared on the fall term exam envelopes.

The first pledge is the standard pledge referring to the
circumstances under which the actual exam is taken. The sec-
ond section as well as the third states that the student gives
his word that he has heard and made “no comment” concern-
ing the examination during the period of the independent exam
schedule.

It seems to us that this is explicit enough. No change in the
verbiage of these pledges is going to make the students more
aware of the simple fact that any comment about the exams is
forbidden,

The real problem facing the future of independent exams
for the students is the bickering over the question of value
and substantive comments. Here, it seems to be a moot point
for anyone to argue what constitutes an honor violation in
either of these cases. The fact is that any comment made about
the examination is grounds for a review of the case in ques-
tion by the Executive Committee. or the EC to commit itself
to the faculty that it will consider infractions in either instance
as honor violations is a breach of the rights of the Executive
Committee to reserve judgment on each individual case.

Qn the other hand, the EC has not helped the examination
question by categorizing the results of the poll as a guideline to
the type of violations which occured last term, The pledge on
the front of the envelope is the only issue involved in the deter
mination of possible deviations from the norms which that
pledge requires.

The burden rests with the students to understand their re
quired silence during the independent exam period, It does not
rest with the EC to draft a more explicit pledge than the pre
sent one, It does not rest with the faculty to threaten the EC
by inference with the possible death of the schedule because of
infractions which occured last term, or ones which might occur

Poverty in and around Rockbridge County poses a serious problem, ac-
cording to the Rockbridge County Welfare Department.

Poverty, Welfare Form
Twin Local Problems

BY KURT KRUMPERMAN

Poverty is one of the greatest
problems that this county faces, and
it is just as pressing in Rockbridge
County as anywhere else. The situa-
tion of poverty can be seen some-
what by looking at the statistics.
Tms article is based on. statistics
from the Rockbridge County Wel-
fare Department, the Rockbridge
County Area League of Women Vot-
ers, and the Rockbridge County
Area Housing Corporation.

The chart to the left indicates the
extent of welfare in the county.

The total budget of the Welfare
Department in the area is $756,560
which is to serve 1011 people. With-
out subtracting the costs of running
the welfare Department (salaries,
supplies, etc.), the budget allows
$748.43 per person per year. This
figure is given only to indicate the
quantities involved but has no par-
ticular relevance to the actual wel-
fare recipient for each case is con-
sidered on individual need.

The maximum allowance for a
family of four in Virginia is:
Standard basic allowance $166.00
Heat and Utilities 18.50
Rent (rent and utilities can go

to maximum of $95) 65 to 75
Laundry $10
Total $259. 50-—269.50

This total figure is equivalent to
$3,130—$3,240/year, which is $603-
613 less than the poverty level of
$3,743 as defined by the Social Sz-
curity Administration in 1969 not to
mention the $5,500 established by
the Labor Department in 1969. Add
to this some other information: in

Wreden Corrected

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:
I am writing this in correction to
Mr. Nick Wreden’s twice-run letter

held this coming Saturday, which he

Military Institute, and several area
girls’ schools held such a “cun-in”
last Spring at Goshen.

However, we most heartily sup-
port this venture and hope that a
large group of students take part in
this highly-~worthwhile undertaking.
It is only through grass-roots efforts
such as this that a considerable part
of the disgusting garbage fouling our
landscape can be eradicated.

Mare James Small

Executive Director,
WAL University Republican
Club

Tebo Vs. Ennis

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:
1 was glad to see another article
by one of our coeds in a recent is-
sue of the paper. | sat down to read
it with sincere interest, soon to find
myself greatly anmwesed. | discussed
the ideas presented by Miss Ennis
with a friend at hand, then thought
for a while on her ideas. | soon
realized that she was serious.

Let it be known, in thai case, I
am serious in this letter, | am not
mocking her ideas—I wim to criticize
them.

First | see her thinking as ambigu-
ous—or maybe self contradictory.
Miss Ennis emphasizes her desires to
be accepted as a student, as an
equal on this campus. Yet she was
“ignored, so she ignored back.” As a
mele here, | do not expect to be
“loved” minute by minute, and I feel
sure that every male here has his
lonely moments too, That is just life
We are acknowledged some of the
time—and not all of the time.

| feel that the profesor who al-
ways inquired if Miss Banis under.
stood the material at hand was not
irying to spite her—but was merely

acknowledging a lady's presence and
trying to be especially helpful.

As far as Miss Ennis’ idea of “an
endless round of dates, never having
to open a door, and being the center
of attention,” I think she’s in a
dream world. I do believe that W&L
males have the common courtesy to
hold a door for a lady, but if Miss
Ennis expects to be “one of the
bunch,” I doubt that many are going
to carry her books, and follow in her
train. That's strictly junior high-
schoolish.

Personally, I did not appreciate
Miss Ennis’ opinion that “jeans and
tennis shoes certainly lend more to
the student image here.” I feel that
the student body as a whole ought to
resent that. And | base my opinion
on a recent incident on camipus: |
was, one afternoon, stopped by a
visitor from California. He and this
wife were very impressed with W&L
and we talked for a long while. He
made the comment that his daughter
now at UCLA, then he com-

that the W&L students were,
on the whole, very neat and excep-

lly well dressed. | was sin-
cerely proud.

I can well see why a female would
be a novelty on campus, since WAL
is now the oldest all men’s school in
the nation. But I feel that Miss En-
nis’ statement “but W&L really was
not psychologically prepared for
women students—even just seven of
them,” is of greatest folly. I see it as
a matter of precedent, One cannot
expect 1527 men to adjust their es-
tablished way of life and daily rou-
tine to seven, yes, even seven wo-
men, I feel that it is folly to expect
an entire University to react to a
stimulus as weak as seven girls on
campus. At this time it is the girls’
job to adjust. The red carpet is roll-
ed out for the President, but rarely
= the janitor in the Senate cham-

;

And I feel that most males in the
world today know that females exist
seven days a week. The point need
not be over-emphasized.

If Miss Ennis feels that her stay
has really been a traumatic experi-
ence, may I ask one question: Why
doesn't she pack up and leave? I do
not say this spitefully, If life is that
harsh at WAL, the grass is always
greener on the other side. No one
requires her to remain, No one even
requests that she stay, But she's wel-
come to stay if it is her desire.

In conclusion, | would like to
stress a few points, First, I am not
against the seven ladies on campus
at all, In fact, I have greatly enjoyed
getting to know one of the coeds this
year, We abways exchange greeting
and I enjoy chatting with her oc-
casionally. | think it's great to have
thsi exchange program, and | sin-
cerely hope it continues.

I can only say that I'm sorry that
Miss Ennis finds life so hard here.
nothing is worse than listening to
someone bitch about something
which is not required, something
that is not imposed upon her, some-
thing that that person chose on her
own free will, Unfortunately, 1 can-
not have pity on Miss Ennis, with
all due respects. Pveryone’s got to
make his or her own way in this

world, and W&L coeds are no special
exceptions.
Watson Tebo

mitted to The Ring-tum Phi follow-

ed in the February 17, 1971 issue of

Kudos To Wreden

‘May a grandmother who believes
the current “younger generation” is
more aware and more concerned
about our country’s problems than
her generation was, commend an
activity that supports her opinion?

I am speaking of Nick Wreden
and his “Goshen Pass Project.” Hav-
ing spent many happy hours in
Goshen Pass before the days of
metal beer cans, my reaction is:
“Hip, Hip, Hooray! and “hats-off”
to the boys who turn out to help!

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:
This letter is a note of explana-
tion concerning the letter of mine
published in last week's newspaper.
Because I fear that the tone of the
letter referred to gives the impres-
sion of a one-track consciousness (in
regard to ROTC), I wish to point
out to the readers that the letter in
question was submitted to the news-
paper on February 7. They took al-
most a full month to print it. That

1966, 50% of the families in Rock-
‘bridge County had an income of less
than $4000 per year and also, Vir-
ginia has the smallest welfare budget
in the United States. All this indi-
cates that people on welfare are not
the only people who are poor and
these poor are not being helped.

In 1968 the Welfare Department
of Lexington handled 78 ADC cases
while in 1971 they are handling 122.
This can be attributed to many con-
ditions. Due to increased mechaniza-
tion, folding fraternities, and general
economic conditions, jobs are scarce
and incomes are low, Women find it
increasingly difficult to find jobs in
the area. Also the increase in the
welfare rolls can be attributed to
mass communication and a change
of thinking, making people more
willing to turn to public assistance.
This admittedly was attributed in
part to the Rockbridge Welfare
Rights Organization.

‘It is felt by most Welfare De-
partment workers that aid to the
‘blind, disabled, and aged persons,
as well as foster children is a rela-
tively successful program because it
meets many of the needs of these
people and is not psychologically
detrimental. But the Aid to Depend-
ent Children (ADC) program is
viewed as a failure for many rea-
sons: (1) it is not adequately meet-
ing the needs of the families either
materially or psychologically, (2)
there are not enough funds to fi-
nance ADC adequately, and (3) in
Lexington and all over the country
the system itself is facing administra-
tive difficulties,

The welfare departments are al-
lowing mothers to fill out their own
statements of need which is designed
to reduce the check-ups that the
Welfare Department used to make.
With this freedom, it is expected that
people be honest about any new de-
velopments in their situation, If this
is not done (it was not established
either way at the Rockbridge Wel-
fare Department) the system itself
became bogged down and inefficient.

Housing presents another massive
problem. It is felt that conditions
have not changed to any great ex-
tent since the 1960 census, which
revealed that one-fourth of the
homes in Buena Vista, one-third in
Lexington, and one-third in the
county were delapitated.

17.1% of the houses were over-
crowded, according to the census
standards. 14% of the houses in
Rockbridge County were built since
1950 compared to a national rate of
27.5%. This poor housing condi-
tion compounds the housing shortage:
that effects all people in the area but
primarily low income families.

The WAL student body creates
much of the housing problem in the
community, Coupled with the great
shortage of houses is the fact that
landlords know that students can pay
larger rents than the community peo-
ple. Students occupy 114 apartments
(at a rent between $25-125) and 105
houses (rented at $30-185). The stu-
dents form a prosperous market
since they have no other place to
live. This situation will not be alle-
viated until W&L offers the reason-
able alternative of on-campus upper
class dormitories.

Few new homes are being con-
structed (9 in Buena Vista, 6 in Lex-
ington, and 62 in the county in
1969.) Buena Vista lost 34 houses in
Flood Camille. Lexington will lose
eventullay 59 houses, most of lower
income families, because of VMI's
plans to build an auditorium and
parking lot at Main and Diamond,
Only 7 of the 42 remaining houses
are structually sound,

In this bleak situation there is one
good thing that is happening. The
Rockbridge County Housing Cor-
poration is planning to build low in-

BY MARC SMALL

Although we are the most active,
dynamic, powerful, nation in the
world, even though we have an in-
dustrial and financial base that has
ibecome the center of the interna-
tional economic system, in spite of
our mechanized & prominent mili-
tary strength, we have become a
nation of diplomatic cowards. We
are no longer willing to assume the
leadership role that our position en-
tails; in some respects, we are no
longer worthy of our greatness.

Our traditional foreign policy was
based on the twin precepts of non-
intervention an dfriendship towards
all states willing to reciprocate: this
policy was abandoned four decades
ago for the far more dangerous and
suicidal concept of enemnity toward
our friends and friendship towards
our enemies.

We make overtures ioward Red
China—a state dedicated to the
overthrow of the United States
while diplomatically ignoring Rho-
desia, whose offer of friendship and
co-operation should have been read-
ily accepted by this country. We
make open attacks on Spain and
Greece, whose governments have re-
stored law and peace to badly-fract-
ured lands.

Remember the “Better-Red-than-
Dead” doctrine? Shouldn't that un-
willingness to fight for ideology be
applied to rightist as well as leftist
nations? We stave off collapse from
infiltrated and corrupt civil govern-
ments, while we open trade relations
with Central and Eastern European
nations whose leaders have firmly
stood behind the Soviet Union in its
drive to topple the popularly-elect-
ed regimes of the Western Bloc.

Through A Spyglass Darkly ...

A New Foreign Policy

 

Why are we so blind? Why do we
fail so utterly to see the prediction
towards which we are approaching?
The answer is found in the increas-
ing tendency of our government to
base its decisions on “morality”: a
nebulous and indefinable abstract
that has only clouded the waters
while failing to provide a firm and
cohesive policy. This too-extensive
use of “morality” in foreign affairs
with little tempering of pragmatism
is unsuitable for many reasons: it
can be interpreted too many ways, it
is not conducive towards rational
thinking, and it is far too emotional
and sentimental for the necessary
pragmatism of state decisions.

“Morality” in diplomacy has its
place most definitely, as nations
should attempt to be honest, fair,
and open-minded towards each other,
but for a nation’s whole foreign pol-
icy to be founded on a moral base is
idealistically unrealistic.

The dangers of such moral diplo-
macy have been seen in our own
time: the Japanese-American con-
flict in the Pacific was the result of a
series of moral positions made by
both states, and when we felt mor-
ally obligated by our Western ethics
to embargo Japan in 1941, they felt
themselves equally honour-bound by
their Code Bushido to attack in de-
fense of the Emperor's honour. This
sort of unfortunate “incident” is
bound to result from the conflict of
two opposing moral codes,

We must return to the sanity of
friendship towards all friendly states
before some “moral” misjudgment
finds us either nuclear ash on a burn-
ing planet, or else, as the logical
conclusion of our current policy,
weak-kneed do-gooders trapped in
the miasma of our own idealism.

Miss Devlin’s Talk
Yields Controversy

BY DOUG BURTON

Sounding her audience with soft
crescendos of her leftist hard line,
socialist revolutionary Bernadette
Devlin announced last week that she
was not ‘bringing the barricades of
Northern Ireland to Randolph-Ma-
con. For a few tense moments it
seemed the demure Macon audience
would bring the barricades to her.

Even before she came, some of
the faculty mumbled that $2,000 was
far too much to pay for a “commun-
ist revolutionary,” yet, the most
vociferous resistance to her crusade
for socialism came from among stu-
dents themselves. The question and
answer period after the speech last
Saturday night included a shout ’em
up between Miss Devlin and a young
male visitor over whether Androw
Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller
made their money or stole it. The
crowd, which to be sure was not un-
animous in its reaction to the self-
disavowed firebrand, indicated by its
applause that the two rich men stole
it. There was, however, no thunder-
ous Johnny-Carson-show vote of
confidence.

LETTERS TQ THE EDITOR

lo the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

I have two remarks. First, with
the general depletion of resources
and mounting waste in this country,
it is unexcusable that student candi-
dates for office post dozens upon
dozens of paper sheets, and in a
flimsy manner,

Many of the sheets fall down or
are torn down and make a mess, as
well as not serving their purpose.
The candidates should be limited in
the number of sheets, be disqualified
if a mess ocours, or be allowed to
publicize only in this paper.

Second, the date of a letter writ-
ten to the editor is often important
A letter may appear several weeks
after it is submitted and may be use-
less by then. Why does this happen?
Is the editor restricted by something
like space requirements, or is he
guided by desire?

lt is only fair to the writer that a
date appear with his letter. I feel
that a date should be required with
a letter, similar to a name being re
quired

“Essentially you are a very selfish
set of people. You like very com-
fortably,” she told the Maconites.
“Many of you dream of the bibera-
tion of women without lifting a pal-
try hand for the women workers of
America. What have you done? No-
ibody is going to knock on your door
and tell you it's time for revolution
. . . People don’t know what is hap-
pening in this country. People are
dying; people are hungry; they’re
fighting over the crumbs because you
won't help them. We are the ma-
jority, but we cannot be without
your help, and we have never had
it.”

Miss Devlin’s catalogue of the
evils and terrors of capitalism dealt
not with Ireland but with the United
States. Her major contention was
that poverty in America was caused
by 5% of the people controlling 80%
of the wealth. “There are only two
kinds of people in the world,” she
said, “workers of the world, and the
exploiters. We are the people of the
world; we are not Catholics or Pro-
testants; we are not Black or Whites
or Chicanos; we are the workers of
the earth.”

Showing obvious signs of fatigue,
Bernadette attended a reception af-
terwards, and, in keeping with her
pugnacity on the stage, met with an
additional battery of questions. Her
appearance concluded her speaking
tour in the United States which be-
gan in mid-February.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

 
   

BY JEFFERY B. SPENCE

If a person here on campus wants
to find out what is going on, or if he
just wants to relax with some friends
over a beer, the place to go is the
Cockpit in the Student Union. The
atmosphere is pleasant and the beer
flows freely.

Unfortunately, there is now the
very real possibility that the beer tap
iat the Cockpit could be shut off. The
reason? Students are consuming al-
coholic beverages in areas of the
Union which is not authorized for
such consumption, In fact, the con-
sumption of any alcoholic beverage
other than 3,2 beer is illegal. The
Stipulations contingent upon W&L
having a beer license are very precise
and very strict.

The University may have a license
if only 3.2 beer is served, and that
the beer remain inside of the area
where it is served. This means that
persons buying beer in the Cockpit
may not carry it outside the confines
of that room. One is not even allow-
ed to transport beer from the Cock-
pit to Evans Dining Hall, which is
the other place authorized for sale
and consumption of beer.

When a place obtains a beer li-
cense in Virginia it is put under
some very strong restrictions. If
they don’t like these restrictions they
can surrender the license. Although
the Cockpit is operated under a dif-
ferent authority than the Union, it is
still endangered by those who bring
in beer or wine from the outside and
drink it anywhere in the contiguous
structure of the Union and Evans
Dining Hall. The A.B.C. license that
we have allows only 3.2 beer ob-
tained in the Cockpit or Evans Din-
ing Hall and it does not allow the
beer to be transported outside of
these two areas to any other rooms.

Admittedly, the Alcoholic Bever-
age Control Board of Virginia, in
their effort to protect the public’s
moral code, has created some assin-
ine rules. However, if we want to
maintain our license we are going to
have to abide by the rules, no matter
how ridiculous they may seem.

One of the major reasons why the
Student Union is being closed down
from two till seven in the morning is
that there has been a great deal of
after-hours drinking which has in-
chided wine, spirits, and 6.4 beer, all
of which could get our license
lifted.

If this practice continues any-
where in the building at anytime we
will lose our privilege to serve beer.

The Endangered License

There is no reason why a small
minority of offenders should be al-
lowed to threaten the privilege en-

Tough Schedule Ahead

Stickmen Ready

BY RAY SWANN

The W&L lacrosse team, coached
by Dick Szlasa, is preparing for a
tough campaign against some of the
best teams in the country.

Led by captain midfielder Whit
Morrill, the team boasts many re-
turning lettermen. Chip Thomkons
and Jim MoCane are other standouts
at the midfielder spot. These upper-
classmen are backed up by a talented
trio of freshmen: Ted Bauer, Skip
Lichtfuss and John Lalley. Coach
Slasa feels the three can develop
into a tight-knit unit.

Returning lettermen at the attack
include leading scorer Sam Engle-
hart, a midfielder last year. Co-cap-
tain Scott Neese and Hank Slauson
help round out the attack. Other at-
tackmen include Matt Lamotte, Bill
Rienhoff and Bob Brumback.

The defense is anchored by letter-
men Tommy Smith, Don Eavenson
and John Rogers. Bill Brunrback, a
Ist-team All American, will miss the
first four games to compete in the
National Swimming meet. Bob Rad-
cliffe, John Larmour, Bob Turco,
and Ed McLaughlin are the other
defensemen.

The goal-tending job is being
fought for by last year’s goalie Bill
Ingersoll, freshman Skeeter Chad-
wick and Charles Robson.

The Generals lost relatively few
players from last year’s squad, All-
American Ned Coslett, Jay Meri-
weather, South All-Star Tom Groton
and John Thomas were senior start-
ers last year.

The highlight of practice so far
was last Saturday's scrimmage
against the tough Mount Washing-
ton Lacrosse Olub, made up of for-
mer stickman from such powers as
Johns Hopkins and Maryland. The
scrimmage was a “learning experi-
ence” for the Generals, many of
whom have only been practicing for
a week.

The season opens March 20th at
home against Randolph-Macon, the
newest addition to our lacrosse divi-
sion. Although a relative newcomer
to lacrosse, the R-M team should
prove a tough opponent.

The English All-Stars come to

LaRue’s Press Box

Heard here and there while wait-
ing for the Virginia weather to make
up its mind...

Look for an Ali-Frazier rematch
this fall in Los Angeles. Why else
would Jack Kent Cooke put up all
that cash? Fight Number Two will
be in Cooke’s swankienda, the For-
um... The place to have gone for
a wager on this fight was Europe,
where Alli, extremely popular, was a
3 to 1 favorite. That is, if you were a
Frazier man. ...

Any team could win the Atlantic
Coast Conference's basketball cham-
pionship this year, but my money is
on an interstate battle between the
Carolinas... .

And this weekend’s hardcourt ac-
tion also features a return contest
between the West Coast powers,
UCLA and Southern California.
That should turn out to be another
close one... .

Washington and Lee's baseball
team faces one of the roughest sche-
dules ever. Included in the spring
trip to Houston are Rice, the South-
west Conference's runner-up to Tex-
as last year, and San Jacinto Junior
College, which reached the finals of
the JUCO World Series . . . Not to
mention home openers with always
tough Long Island University and
Southern Connectiout. ...

After spending three years on the
tour, J. C. Snead, a nephew of
Slammin’ Sam, finally broke into the
money with victories in the Tucson
Open and the recently completed
Doral-Eastern Open. He earned elss
than his present winnings in a four
year stint as an outfielder in the
Washington Senators’ chain. .. .

1 can’t help but shudder about
what’s going to happen this year
with those perennial baseball bad-
boys Denny McLain and Richie Al-
len.

Mlb Beanies: ACE Manballl

  

First Charley Finley suited his
Athletics in bright green and gold,
with white shoes. Then Pittsburgh
went mod with those pullover and
pull-on uniforms with elastic. Now
the big thing is a colorful ball glove,
like those worn by some Cincinnati
and New York Met players... .

Frazier’s vietory denied a lot of
people the chance to see Ali stroke
out Howard Cosell, an event almost
as eagerly awaited as the fight itself
... But at least the people who paid
those terrific sums for ringside seats
got their money's worth. The Ali-
Cleveland Williams fight in Houston
some years ago was Over One minute
and 23 seconds into the first
round. ...

Rumor has it perhaps unfounded
—that Redskin Head Coach George
Allen has another giant trade cooked
up... And whatever happened to
John Romnosky?

day, March 11 at 3:30 p.m. on Wil-

W&L basketball, with all its hoop-
la, is over for the 1970-71 season.
Hopefully, the Generals have closed
out the career of Doremus with a
win, as the plans call for the team to
move into the new gymnasium next
year. With much luck, next year’s
squad will open the season with Vir-
ginia, at home.

ain’s best players, the team has been
learning American rules for about a
month in preparation for competi-
tion in this country. Unlike many
foreign teams that have visited the
U.S., they come to play a serious,
hard-nosed game. It is hoped that
the team’s tour will help lacrosse
gain the status of an Olympic sport.

Dartmouth, a perennial Ivy Lea-
gue contender, comes to town on
March 24, followed by East Caro-
lina on the 27th.

Also on the schedule this year are
two of the three national co-cham-
pions, Navy and U. Va. The Blue

team which barely survived a late
General rally last year. Duke ends

losses sustained from last year’s ex-
cellent team. In spite of the fact that
the club started with no seniors, it
finished second among the state's
small colleges.

The Generals compiled a 7-3 re-
cord against in-state competition.
They were 17-8 overall. For the
fourth time in five years, Washington
and Lee garnered first place in the
OAC basketball tournament. This
year’s team went 10-1 at home, los-
ing only to Loyola of Baltimore by
one point. It's a shame that we have
to leave Doremus,

turns up many glaring weaknesses.
Perhaps the most obvious of these
was the lack of a consitsent scorer to
complement Mike Daniel. Mike was
the only General to average double
figures. We need a shooter, one that
can hit from the outside with consis-
tency.

Another problem was a lack of
height. The squad could use another
big man. However, I understand that
this year's recruiting has been aimed
at solving this problem. Most of
Coach Canfield’s prospects are 6'4”
or better.

In spite of these problems, the
Generals had a more than adequate
year. This can be attributed to an
excellent defense, a very strong
bench, and, primarily, to a great
deal of hustle. It was a frequent oc-
curence to see one of the squad on
the floor after a loose ball. The
matchasp defenes worked well. Al-
most everyone on the team started at
least one ball game. These assets
proved more than enough to achieve
a winning season. Also, it is com-
forting to know that the Generals
will improve with age: next year’s
team will be older, wiser, and better
balanced.

This year's team improved with
every game. After losing a close con-
test with Loyola, the Generals came
back from 13 points down against
UNC. They showed that they never
quit, and, in that game, they showed
a great deal of poise.

Dhis year’s record could have been
a little betier. Perhaps the losses to
Hampden-Sydney and Navy could
have been avoided, but most of the
other losses were due, at least in
part, to a very tough schedule.

Whatever we did wrong, we siill
ended with a 17-8 record. “A new
era has begun.”

hopefully construction will begin in
early spring.

R.C.H.C, is a non-profit onganiza-
tion which will have 40 years to pay
off a $600,000 loan and interest.
Therefore, the rents must be large
enough to pay this loan. The renter
must pay 25% of his income while
the government will pay up to 70%
of the rent. Thus it is estimated that
the minimum income of a family
able to rem here will be $2,100,
therefore eliminating the very poor.
No overcrowding will be allowed,
which enables people to pay for pre-
sent housing but may restrict their
eligibility for Mountain View Ter-
race. There may be further restric-
tions on its residents, but these are
not defined as of yet.

So, although Mountain View Ter-
race may lessen the housing prob-
lem, it is by no means solved with
only 40 units, The housing problem
will remain unsolved; the poor con-
tinue to be in the same situation.

Only the poor have a monopoly

Brian Greig, has definite plans for

“could come back.” Their only ques-

Board cannot spend lavish sams on
its tight budget.

Perhaps the ball might return but
with a new format. None of the
Dance Board members contacted
favored the old black tie format.
The old theme concept however
might be incorporated in the new
Fancy Dress Ball scheme.

So, is the Fancy Dress Ball gone

W&L Admissions Bucking Trend

While many private colleges and
universities appear to be experienc-
ing a dramatic slump in the number
of students applying for admission
next fall, officials today reported “an
opposite trend, an encouraging ad-
missions picture” in both the under-
graduate and law divisions for W&L.

In the School of Law alone, ap-
plications are up by more than 50
per cent, according to Law Dean
Roy Steinheimer, Jr. Even before de-
ciding on March | to accept no fur-
ther applications, he said, the law
school had 10 formal applications on
file for each place in next Septem-
iber’s entering class.

On the undergraduate level, Ad-
missions Dean James D. Farrar not-
ed a small increase in the number of
applications received, “perhaps one
per cent.” Last year Washington and
Lee received about 1,250 applica-
tions for some 370 places in its fresh-
man class, Farrar said. This year a
slightly higher number of applica-
tions will be proceeded, with the uni-
versity aiming at an undergraduate
freshman enrollment of 350 to 370.

The increase in applications comes
despite an announced increase in
Washington and Lee's comprehen-
sive fee (tuition plus officially fixed
expenses), and despite a simultane-

joyed by the majority of students
here at W&L. Therefore | appeal to
those of you who have violated the
rules to cease and desist before we
have our license lifted as a result of
your activities.

There is one other problem that
we face in relation to the Cockpit:
the increasing influx of local under-
age children coming to the Cockpit.
They are a constant threat to our
A.B.C. license. As a result, the
Union has posted a sign to the ef-
fect that only students, faculty, staff,
and their guests at W&L may use
this establishment.

It is a great idea if it is enforced,
so let's enforce it. The other night
I saw at least 15 children from the
Lexington-Buena Vista area most of
whom I know to be underage.

If we are going to protect our-
selves as a community it is going to
be necessary for us to help Murph
police the Cockpit by turning in to
him those persons who are not sup-
posed to be on the premises. Our
beer license is a great thing to have,

IN JOINT

On Involvement

BY STEVE ROBINSON
President-elect of the Student Body

Washington and Lee has experi-
enced many changes in the two and
a half years I have been here, but
student government has remained
fairly static until just recently. The
formation of the University Council
has, for the first time, given the stu-
dents of W&L real power in the
University government. However,
to make full use of this opportunity,
the potential of the U.C, must be un-
derstood, and some of the ideas and
habits of the students must change.

In previous years, many student
ideas of liberalization of various
University policies regarding student
life were suggested. They would be
brought before the E.C., and many
times, were approved by this group.
rhe suggestion went on to the fac-
ulty, and many times was rejected,
and here the proposal died. With the
formation of the University Council,
the faculty will be bypassed in mat-
ters concerning student affairs.

Yet this group of men should not
just become a place where students
can get resolutions passed, such as
liberalization of parietals, that the
entire faculty would not endorse. In-
stead this body can serve as an offi-
cial intermediary between students
and faculty and administration. The
Council should serve as a sounding
board for ideas brought up by stu-
dents and faculty. It is with these
duties that one must realize the im-
portance of the University Council.

Thus the elections for student
members of the University Coun-
cil, which are a week from today,
are ones of great inyportance. This
body whil be the one which, hope-
fully, will determine the direction of
the University in many matters of
current interest. This group will be
the one that can really accomplish
things of mutual benefit to students
and faculty and administration.

Another aspect of student govern-
ment that remained relatively con-
stamt is the apathy. This must not
prevail if the student government is
to reach its potential. Granted, many
people did not know what was being

Washington and Lee University’s Weekly Newspaper

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, MARCH 17, 1971

Steve Robinson Is Elected;
Calls For ‘Communication’

p.m. the results for Student Body of-
ficers were not announced until 7:00.
The delay was due to the close races
for both offices and numerable re-
counts.

Steve Robinson, a junior from
Alexandria, Va., said he thought im-
provement needed to be made in the
lines of communication between the
Executive Committee and the Stu-
dent Body. Robinson stated that “a
lot of work can be done with the
University Council (which he will
serve On in an ex officio basis), One
of the first topics that can be dis-
cussed there is drugs. Another is
parietals, With the University Coun-

EC Studies Exam Pledge;

Change Is Recommended

The Executive Committee has re-
commended a change in the pledge
on the independent examinations.
The EC called for a return to the old
pledge used on regular tests and
papers.

Law Representative Jim Slay,
moved that “the wording on the en-
velopes does not apply. Students
should write the existing pledge: ‘On
my honor as a Washington and Lee
gentleman I pledge I neither gave or
received aid on this examination.’ ”
This motion passed 9-1 with Ogilvie
dissenting.

Slay emphasized in his motion
that value judgments (such as saying
an examination was “hard") would
be subject to honor trials. Slay also
pointed out that any exam that is
turned in for a grade is assumed to
be pledged, whether it is pledged or
not,

Student Body President Fran Law-
rence explained the rationale for this
decision by the EC. “We made a
mistake in accepting the original
wording of the pledge from the fac-
ulty. This action is an attempt to re-
affirm the original pledge which we
consider sufficient.”

Phe EC also announced the candi-
dates who had submitted petitions
for class office elections, which will
be conducted next Monday with run-
offs Wednesday.

In the senior class four men are
running for president. The candi-
dates are: Bo Brookby, David Har-
bert, James MeCane and Bert Meem
From the Soience School Charlie
Pride was unopposed for vice presi-
dent. John Lawlor and Doug Madi-
son will contend for Commerce
School vice president. In the Arts
School vice presidential race are

Four upcoming juniors are seek-
ing the presidency of the class of

Chuck Dunn and George Wolfe
have filed their petitions for that of-
fice. Larry Evans and Gary Polia-
koff are candidates for junior vice
president. In the election for EC rep-
resentatives are: Archer Frierson,

ter, and Robert Sherwood,

It is a three way race for the
president of the Sophomore class.
Declared candidates include: Durant

McCain. Chris Overcash was unop-
posed for vice president of the class
of °74. Russ Fletcher, Floyd Lewis,
Mike Weinstein and Steve Wood-
ruff are running for the two sopho-
more seats on the EC. A late-filing
candidate for Sophomore EC is
Mike Brittin.

Jim Slay relayed to The Ring-tum
Phi that the Law School would hold
its elections early next week. The
candidates from the Law School will
speak tonight. Up for election in the
Law School are three positions on
the University Council and two seats
on the EC.

It was announced that election
posters should not go on anything
painted white on the campus, espec-
ially columns and trim. The Build-
ings and Grounds men will tear fly-
ers that are posted on these surfaces
because they hurt the paint.

cil consisting of equal numbers of
faculty and students, it can be an ex-
cellent medium of change.”

“] think the current informality of
the EC is unrealistic,” Robinson ob-

served. “The EC must get things
done. It cannot afford to waste
time.”

Robinson added that, “I’m pretty
well aware of things going on in the
EC now. I've tried to talk with the
current members about their activi-
ties on the EC. I don't think there
will be any loss of continuity.”

Rick Gray, a sophomore from
Dallas, Texas, also admitted that he
hoped to improve the communica-
tion between the EC and the stu-
dents. “It is my biggest hope for next
year,” Gray commented. “I see three
methods of accomplishing this as
Secretary of the Student Body. First,
I can talk to The Ring-tum Phi re-
porters and be sure that all the facts
concerning the students are present-
ed fully and correctly. Second, |
‘hope to expand the publication and
distribution of the EC minutes.
Third, maybe we can start an EC
newsletter with a summary of events
before the EC.”

Gray continued his thoughts on
his new office, “I don’t think a lot of
people know how to get information
about their student government.
These people stay uninformed and
uninvolved.”

According to the Student Body
Constitution, the newly elected of-
ficers cannot take office until gradua-
tion in June. However, it is the cus-
tom of previous ECs for these newly
elected members to be invited to the
meetings remaining this year. This
custom has developed so that the
officers can get a better idea of how
the EC operates.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

March 17, 1971

Riverboat Gambling And The Dance Board

“I want to bring the Fancy Dress Ball
back to Lexington.” That quotation could
have come from a great number of W&L stu-
dents. That it came from newly elected
Fancy Dress President Brian Greig is all the
more significant, though.

Some might have thought that Mr. Greig
was only half-serious when he ran for the of-
fice last week. But his comments after the
elections last week are dead serious, But so
what?

This year’s Dance Board President Skip
Nottberg wasn’t exactly relishing the decision
to delete the affair from this year’s fare of
entertainment. The death blow to Fancy
Dress was dealt reluctantly but realistically
by the Dance Board.

Casting all sentiment aside, the problem
with THE BALL is not lack of student in-
terest, but lack of funds. To combat this un-
controllable pauperism, next year’s Dance
Board President Bert Meem has suggested
that what’s needed is a money raising cam-
paign in the spring. The Board could sell tic-
kets for $30 this spring, $35 this summer, and
$40 next year. That arithmetical progression
would make the budgeting chore all the more
realistic,

We agree with Mr, Greig and Mr, Meem.
Fancy Dress should return—perhaps with
some alterations in the format. Changes in
the program aren't the issue. What is really at
stake is the future of the Dance Board itself.

Mr. Meem’s plan to raise money looks
good on paper, but a quick glance at past sales
figures shows that it probably won't work.
The 1969-70 Dance Board under the leader-
ship of Dean Kumpuris sold 770 dance plans,
had a Fancy Dress, and left a $6,000 deficit.
The deduction could be made that somewhere
on the ledger, more dance plan money was
desperately needed. From the outset of this
year, Mr. Nottberg has had more than his
share of financial problems—the W&L re-
cord for the least number of dance plans sold
(770) was broken with only 440 takers by
September 30, 1970.

Mr. Meem may be optimistic about the
money he'll take in this spring, but we're not
—we see a fault in his logic. Students’ musical
tastes are more varied now than they ever
have been; they waited this year (as in years
past) to see what entertainers the Board
would sign before they even thought of fork-
ing out $40. What's to make them any differ-

ent this spring? Or next year?

The problem remains: how do you run a
Dance Board on little or no money? You can
gamble. And you can lose big if you sign an
entertainer that no one wants to see. The
point is, if you are running a Dance Board,
you cannot take the Brand X route. Even if
you don’t have the money, you have to sign
somebody well-known—or your dance plan
buyers will not be happy. But how can you
financially justify signing an expensive group
with no guarantee of a return from their ap-
pearance?

Our vision of a good Dance Board Presi-
dent is not a Mississippi riverboat gambler
in a white suit with a black string tie. With
the rising cost of entertainment, the Dance
Board is clearly destined for financial obli-
vion. Unless the only sound alternative is
taken: the institution of an entertainment
fee.

The fee would be collected from all stu-
dents during registration for the fall term
next year. Dance plans would not be neces-
sary then, for the Dance Board would be tak-
ing in money from all students. All that
would be required at the door would be the
W&L identification card. The Board itself
could determine how much they will need
for a workable budget and then break that
cost down to fee level itself (which would
probably be in the range of $25 to $30.)

The critics will enter at this point with ob-
jections to this psoposal on the grounds that
some students may not wish to attend all of
the concerts during a year’s time because they
didn’t like the entertainment offered, Or be-
cause they do not like to attend concerts. If
these same objections were raised to the fee
for Contact, they would be just as valid.

Not everyone is going to participate in
the Contact program even though they paid
to support it. Not everyone is excited about
attending concerts, either, The point remains
that if the caliber of concerts which came to
W&L. three or your years ago is to be upheld
in the future, students are going to pay as a
group for that quality.

The Fancy Dress Ball did not happen this
year because of money problems. If Mr.
Greig wants it to happen next year and if Mr.
Meem wants the stability of a relatively fixed
and larger budget for the Board, then they
both should push for the only means by which
their jobs can be accomplished : a fixed fee.

A Not-So-Trite Comment On Drugs

Several days ago, we received a reprint
from a recent bulletin of the Sigma Nu Fra-
ternity which we thought expressed the hu-
man tragedy of the drug abuse crisis better
than any computerized accounting of deaths
that have occured from the reckless misuse
of drugs.

Below is a letter from the dean of students
at Amherst College, Robert A. Ward, to his
students following the death of a student who
fell from the roof of a dormitory while under
the influence of LSD. The student was from
Harvard University, visiting the campus at
the time of his death.

“He was not an Amherst man; he was a
visitor. But his death occurred in our com-
munity and we shared in the loss. We were
shocked by the tragedy and stunned by the
senselessness of it. He was young and bright

too bright to surrender his life in the foolish
madness blighting a generation, In a week in
which we paused to reflect on the waste of
life half a world away, it may have been a
strange irony that we were starkly faced with
meaningless death on our campus, But that
week is nearly gone—and memory fades,

“1 will not rehearse the statements made
in the past about drugs. Many of us for some
time have been apprehensive that a tragedy
would come—and last Saturday night it did,
Repeated warnings had gone unheeded; it
couldn't happen here. | only wish those who
ignored those warnings could have spent part
of that horrible night waiting in Cooley Dick-
inson Hospital while the student's life ebbed

or part of Sunday afternoon in my office while
his parents struggled to comprehend the
reality of that day.

“I did not become dean to watch a genera-
tion of students pollute their sanity or distort
their lives, and I confess to a numbing and de-
pressing sense of helplessness. Words are in-
adequate and deeds seem fruitless, More than
ever students have taken on themselves the
individual responsibility which shapes their
lives in all areas, It should be so, but the judi-
cious exercise of such responsibility demands
wisdom, I see no wisdom at all in the growing
and indiscriminate use of drugs, I also see a
danger that one major tragedy may obscure
other tragedies, smaller perhaps but no less
frightening.

“On a beautiful Saturday afternoon which
was in itself a natural stimulant, why the
need for some artificial or uncertain drug?
And where were we all on that night or on
any night and when will we awake to the need
to replace a disinterest privatism with a sus-
tained concern for troubled people in our
community? And why do we tolerate in our
midst the profiteers of poison? And by what
moral right do we pass into the hands of
others substances which can threaten their
well-being and even their lives? What in
God's name is happening to us?

“Last Sunday in a scriptural lesson the
timeless chastisement of Thomas was repeat-
ed: ‘Because you did not see, you would not
believe,” Last Sunday we did see, Now I plead

as never before-—-please believe.”

‘Excitement’ Keynotes One-Acts

BY STEVE HAUGHNEY

Last night the Troubadour Theat-
re opened its third major production
of this season, five student-directed
one-act plays, with three Chekhov
pieces on the boards. The schedule
calls for the Chekhov plays. “The
Proposal,” “Swan Song,” and “The
Boor,” to run again tomorrow night,
March 8, and for two contempor-
ary plays, Arthur Kopit’s “Sing to
Me Through Open Windows” and
Murray Mednick’s “Sand,” to play
tonight and again on Friday night,
March 19.

For the five members of the
Troubs who are directing these
plays, this production represents an
exacting challenge. They have cho-
sen and blocked the scripts, audi-
tioned and selected the casts, and
during the past few weeks have
struggled to realize on stage their
own interpretations of the plays. All
five are accomplished actors, but the
transition from acting in a play to
directing a play is a very difficult
one.

“Sing to Me Through Open Win-
dows,” directed by Walkie May,
will be the first play under the lights
tonight. It presents the image of a
small boy visiting a remote and fan-
tastic house deep in a forest, the
home of an aging magician and his
‘butler. May has gotten fine perfor-
mances out of his actors, Richard
Pilkinton as the magician and Doug
Thomas as the butler, pacing their
dialogue to a slow and dreamy ca-
dence. This Romantic, “lost world”
atmosphere is in shanp contrast to
Greg Buch’s set, which is cluttered
with mundane objects. To me this
contrast is one of the most interest-
ing and successful features of the
play, and it is skillfully emphasized
by the lighting. This is May’s first
try at directing, and he has done an
excellent job.

The second play tonight will be
“Sand,” directed by Hugh Hill. The
mood of this piece is quite different
from the one that will precede it;
Mednick’s play is an example of
current American avant-guarde: it is
loud, brutal, and shocking. To my
mind the dialogue in the script is not
outstanding, but Hill has squeezed it
for all it's worth. He effects a count-
erpoint between the violent quarrel-
ing of the mother and the father,

The Chesapeake and Ohio Rail-
road has almost completed the pull-
ing wp of its tracks between Lex-
ington and Buena Vista. The rail-
road used to run next to the Maury
River winding along the north bank
for six miles from one community to
the other. When the flood came, cer-
tain portions of the track were made
unusuable. A bridge or two was
washed out and some of the ties
were undermined and left suspended
in mid-air, held up by the rails
alone.

What remains though is a wonder-
ful trail bed which could be used as
a hiking and a bicycling path. The
view is really beautiful. Because of
an impressive line of hills between
the path and Route 60, the path ‘s
undisturbed by any noise of automo-
biles or trucks cruising down the
highway. In short, it is an excellent
place for recreation and solitude.

The Roalroad may want to sell
this land, and the Commonwealth of
Virginia and Rockbridge County
have each expressed an interest in
purchasing it. The Chesapeake and
Ohio Railroad however does not
have to sell the land to either of
these governments. And so the Wash-
ington and Lee Ecology Club has
drawn up a petition designed to in-
fluence both the actions of Chesa-
peake and Ohio and the actions of

Guarding The License
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Thanks to Jeff Spence for his en-
hightening letter regarding the danger
the Cockpit faces of losing its A.B.-
C, License because of unauthorized
consumption of 6.4 beer, wine and
spirits. Approximately 50 or 60
places each month, in the state of
Virginia, have their license suspend.

other offenses,

huve separate licenses, this is one
reason the beer cannot be transport.
ed from one place to the other.
Dance weekends are the time when
we most frequently find students in-
dulging in their alcoholic “Goodies”
during the meal period. If the A.B.C.
man comes in and finds this, and
they DO check, that could be the
end of the license.

On February 19 last, we exercised
our license for the first time when
we set up a “bar” for the dance in
the commons. We plan to do this
again—tut not without our A.B.C
License.

played by Fanny Russell and Jim
Goodrich respectively, and the bur-
eaucratic monotone of the ambassa-
dor, played by Nick Wreden, who
arrives to inform them that their son
is missing in action. Hill has done
well with this counterpoint, but the
problem he faces is with the script
itself, which seems to me to be slight
and obvious, offering little opportun-
ity for the director's imagination.

The “Evening of Chekhov” be-
comes more delightful with each suc-
cessive play. The Chekhov fare,
which the Troubs will offer Thurs-
day night, is the best of his one act
canon: “The Proposal,” “Swan
Song,” and “The Boor,”

“The Proposal” is a “joke” in one
act, according to Chekhov. The joke
involves a hypochondriacal landown-
er who arrives at his neighbor's
home to propose to his friend’s
daughter. Unfortunately, the pro-
posal is soon forgotten as arguments
ensue over ownership of lands and
the quality of their respective dogs.

The play itself is one of Chekhov's
funniest, but the joke in director
Tommy Bear's production needs
some polishing. The Chekhov's hum-
our is keenly focused on human
situations and the human comedy of
their outcome. The problem with the
play lies primarily in its interpreta-
tion: is it a farce with two dimen-
sional characters or is it more of a
joke about humanity?

Beach Vickers as Lomov, the land-
owner who imagines all sorts of
aches and pains, lacks a human qual-
ity and depth in the interpretation of
his illness. Kirk Kirkpatrick has done
an admirable job with Choobokov,
considering that he had a week to

work a part vacated by another stu-
dent. As the father of Lomov’s in-
tended, his character has little of the
Russian ‘brashness and _ strength
which the production needs to offset
Lomov’s imagined sicknesses, The
daughter of Choobukov is played by
Karen Brammer with some good in-
terpretations of situations within the
play, but here again, the human
quality of her actions is lacking in
consistency.

“The Proposal” is not without its
comic moments, but due to a lack of
form to the production and, in my
opinion, a misinterpretation of the
play, the joke to this human relation-
ship never quite gets told.

The second offering of the evening
is “Swan Song,” a piece which Chek-
hov wrote in an hour and 10 min-
utes. The change of pace which this
show provides for the one acts is
well handled by director David
Christovich. The audience is pre-
sented with a shambled stage, scat-
tered with props and stage scenery.
Into this empty blackness walks Svet-
lovidov, an old vaudeville actor who
has overslept in the theatre after one
of his final performances. As the
actor, John Stack reviews his life
and faces the true desolation of his
existence. His performance is as be-
bievable as the mood which the set
creates.

When Lawrence Reed, a dishevel-
ed prompter, rushes to the actor's
side to give him the lines of the Fool
from “King Lear,” that moment cap-
tures the essence of the play's grasp
upon the viewer. The extraordinary
excitement of Christovich’s produc-
tion is that he has worked with his

can novelist and short story-writer,
will visit W&L for two weeks in
May under the university's Glasgow
Endowment Visiting Scholars pro-
gram.

The author of “A Long and Happy
Life,” which won the William Faulk-
ner prize in 1962 as the year’s best
first novel, Price has also written

the government if the Railroad sells
them the land. Below is the petition
in full.

“The Chesapeake and Ohio Rail-
road is currently removing its tracks
between Lexington and Buena Vista.
This land, currently occupied by the
tracks, would provide an excellent
site for public recreation such as
hiking, bicycling and camping. To
our knowledge, the Commonwealth
of Virginia and Rockbridge County
have both expressed an interest in
purchasing this land.

Therefore, we petition the Chesa-
peake and Ohio Railroad to sell this
property to the local, state or federal
government; and we also petition
that if this land is sold to a local,
state of federal government that that
government use it for the above
mentioned purposes and that mo-
torized vehicles be specifically ex-
cluded.”

The Washington and Lee Ecology
Club would very much like to see
this land used for these purposes,
and we are asking for support from
the Student Body and the Faculty.
Ali we need is your signature. The
petition is posted in the Student
Union and also on the bulletin
board outside of the Co-op. We ap-
preciate your support.

(1963), a collection of stories, “A
Generous Man” (1966), “Love and
Work” (1968), both novels, and, last
year, “Permanent Errors,” another
collection of stories.

During his two-week visit sche-
duled May 10 through 21, he will
deliver at least one public lecture
and one or two readings. Other pub-
lic appearances may be scheduled as
well, according to the Glasgow Com-
mittee, under whose sponsorship
Price will appear.

In addition, the writer will main-
tain office hours at the university for
student writers and will, when pos-
sible, read and critique their manu-
scripts,

Born in Macon County, North
Carolina, Price received his B.A. de-
gree from Duke University in 1955,
and as a Rhodes Scholar he attend-
ed Merton College, Oxford, for three
years. He returned to Duke as a
member of the English faculty in
1968, where he is now associate pro-
fessor. He has served as writer-in-
residence at the Universities of Kan-
sas and North Carolina (Chapel
Hill).

The Arthur Graham and Mar-
garet Glasgow Endowment, created
in 1960 through a bequest from Mr.
Glasgow, is designed “to promote
the art of expression by pen and
tongue.” Previous Glasgow Visiting
Scholars have included Katherine
Anne Porter, Edward Albee, James
Dickey, Robert Penn Warren and
David Stacton. Last year, the pro-
gram sponsored a week-long sym-
posium on the contemporary motion
picture, which included the world
premiere of the Columbia film
“Watermelon Man.”

Welfare, Poverty Continue
Throughout County Area

BY KURT KRUMPERMAN

There is a channel in which those
who wish to do something in the
area of poverty can do so: Virginia
VWRO. VWRO is running a state-
wide campaign aimed to recruit col-
lege students and graduates for a
year of volunteer service in the state.
There are many jobs available: 1) re-
cruiting and organizing new or grass-
roots WRO groups in rural or ur-
iban areas, 2) working on issue cam-
paigns, such as Title 1, food pro-
grams, etc., 3) fund raising, 4) form-
ing coalitions with other groups that
would help VWRO, such as labor
unions, community action groups,
etc., 5) legal aid which involves wel-

fare law research and representation
of people at fair hearings, and 6)
working with Friends of WRO, who
are non-poor people supporting the
aims and projects of WRO. VWRO
is already performing all these tasks
‘but in needs more organizers to help
the poor to form themselves into
functioning self-sufficient grouips.
This program is obviously geared
toward graduating seniors and law
school seniors. The question of the
draft will have to be handled indivi-
dually. The only benefit WRO offers
in this respect is that CO’s have been
allowed to work for the Welfare
Rights Organization. There is also a

Through A S

BY MARC SMALL

The cruelest reality of life is that
one is frequently forced to act in a
cruel—yet responsible—manner: for
example, when we spank a child for
playing in the street or when a po-
liceman kills a homicidal maniac.
In the face of this reahity, we con-
tinue to maintain a welfare struc-
ture that is, as the adage says, kill-
ing its victims with kindness.

At first glance it seems rational
and humane to give someone who is
down on their luck a little kindness:
“Just enough to tide me over until
I find a job!” the bindlestiff says as

‘we give him a dole. The surface

measure of charity is quite com-
mendable and manages to aid many

‘who are earnestly in distress.

However, when we approach the
structured gargantua of the welfare
programs, we also leave the realm
of reasonable charity and approach
an absurd plateau of human folly: a
‘woman in Chicago with several chil-
dren is given $15,000 per annum,
New York welfare recipients are
housed in the Waldorf-Astoria, and
all the while the National Welfare
Rights Organization continues to
lobby for greater and greater pay-
ments,

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

  

BY JEFFREY B. SPENCE
“the pursuit of its educational
purpose in a climate of learning that
stresses the importance of the in-
dividual, his personal honor and in-
tegrity, his harmonious relationship
with his fellow man, and his respon-
sibility to serve society through the
productivity of his training and his
talent.”

What you have just read is the
second basic fundamental punposet
that Washington and Lee states as
its institutional philosophy on page
seven of the newly released W&L
catalogue. This is certainly an ex-
cellent philosophy to have. If how-
ever, you continue to read on in the
catalogue you'll find some interest-
ing points of view both expressed by
insertion and omission.

To read our catalogue, you would
think that W&L would have us be-
lieve that the majority of students
here at school uphold the tie and
jacket tradition. This, of course, is
not true. If we further scrutinize the
catalogue one will not find pictured
anywhere any person who is black
or anyone who wears long hair. It
seems as if our alma mater would
rather that people believed that our
school is populated by straight white,
Anglo-Saxon, protestants exclu-
sively.

I do not show who is responsible
for the contest of our catalogue but
that person or group of persons is
either highly prejudiced or else
iblind. Contrary to popular opinion
this school is no longer lily-white,
nor for that matter does the student
body here look anything like the
student body that wanders around
the campus of Bob Jones University.

The second basic fundamental in
the W&L philosophy that I quoted
refers to the importance of the in-
dividual. If 1 was an individual on
this campus who was black, | would
certainly question how important
Washington and Lee seemed to think
I was. It seems from the apipearance
of the catalogue that blacks are not
only unimportant but that at this
school they are non-existent. Con-
sider for a second being black, how
would you respond to the W&L cata-
logue with its all white columns and
its all white people? I don't know
about you, but I would sure as hell
have serious second thoughts as to
whether I'd attend a school pictured
as ours is,

With Malice Toward Some

The Catalogue Fallacy

  
 
 

I am not so naive to believe that
public relations are unheard of at
W&L. I also realize that the catalo-
gue falls within the range of public
relations endeavors here at Wash-
ington and Lee. Public relations or
not, lying by omission is a serious
act to commit and it is equally as
bad as lying by commission. The sec-
ond phrase of the above quoted
statement refers to the stressing of a
man’s personal honor and integrity.

The catalogue, as presently con-
structed violates the integrity of
every black man and long-hair on
this campus, It is certainly no ex-
ample of \personal honor, when an
administration publication misrepre-
sents the institution by both word
and construct.

If the University believes its stated
philosophy, especially its third point
of having a harmonious relationship
with our fellow men, then let us see
some tolerance and understanding
from the top. If we are being groom-
ed here at W&L to meet our respon-
sibility to serve society through the
productivity of our training, then
why is not the institution that claims
these ideals for us living up to these
ideals also. What say you Admini-
stration? Peace.

Debate Squad
Riding High

“Despite limited size and experi-
ence, we have shown ourselves to be
on a competitive level with top rate
debate powers.” Sophomore Co-cap-
tain Bob Bruyere was speaking of
Washington and Lee's performance
in the ten debate tournaments at-
tended so far this year.

Making some long trips, as far
south as Florida and north as far as
New York and Baltimore, the debate
team has put in several very credit-
able performances. At the Univer-
sity of Florida Invitational Debate
Tournament, the W&L team placed
sixth out of fifty schools.

Later in the year, at the Delta
Sigma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha Dis-
trict Debate Tournament, Washing-
ton and Lee combined a second
place negative team and a fourth
place affirmative team to take the

Scrimmages Helpful

Yale, Roanoke College
Battle Generals
On Lacrosse Field

With the completion of Saturday’s
scrimmage against Yale, W&L’s La-
crosse team is preparing for its regu-
lar season opener against Randolph-
Macon this Saturday. For the first
time this season, the Yellow Jackets
are competing with W&L in the
South Atlantic Division of the NC-
AA. Macon is loaded with talented
Baltimore high school graduates, and
they played the Generals to a 7-7
tie last year in the pre-season scrim-
mage. They are considered to be a
serious threat for the league cham-
pionship this year, as are the Gen-
erals, so the game should be a big
one.

In preparation for Saturday's open-
er, W&L has played in three scrim-
mages against Mt. Washington La-
crosse Club, Roanoke, and Yale.
These scrimmages have indicated
that W&L is much stronger at mid-
field than ever before, with the ad-
dition of eight freshmen. Co-captain
Whit Morrill, an All-American last
year, runs on one unit with fresh-
men Ted Bauer and John Lalley,
both of whom were first-team Alll-
Maryland as high school seniors.

Returning lettermen Chip Tomp-
kins and Jim McCane form a sec-
ond unit with freshmen Skip Licht-
fuss, another All-Maryland pick last
year, Freshman Jim Farrar joins
with lettermen Tim Winfield and
Ed Tognetti on the third midfield.
Sophomore John Conrad and four
more freshmen—Mark Morrill, Jim
Stieff, Ken Seal, and Rich Roman-
elli—provide the Generals with
greatly needed depth at midfield.

The midfields have, indeed, been

9999999099 O9099900900999

Capitol LP’s

bolstered. Of the 24 goals scored in
scrimmages, 15 were tallied by mid-
dies, as Whit Morrill had four, Bau-
er and Lichtfuss three apiece, Tog-
netti two, Mark Morrill, Lalley, and
Romanelli one each.

The attack also appears stronger
this year. Sam Englehart, last year’s
leading goal scorer, is playing crease
attack, and his five goals in pre-sea-
son indicate that he is ready for an-
other high scoring year. Co-captain
Scott Neese, an All-Conference pick
last year (along with Morrill, Engle-
hart, and goalie Bill Ingersoll) also
appears ready, having scored one
goal and 5 assists in the scrimmages.

Hank Slauson and Bob Brumback
are again battling for the third spot
on attack, but both will see consider-
able action, regardless of which one
starts. Each scored against Mt.
Washington, and Slauson added a
second against Roanoke. Matt La-
Motte and Bill Reinhoff complete
W&L’s attack.

On the defense, jobs are up for
grabs. Tommy Smith, Don EBaven-
son, John Rogers, and John Lar-
mour will all see plenty of playing
time, as could Ed McLaughlin, Bob
Radcliffe, and freshman Bob Turco.
The defense is very young, and its
ability to jell in the early season
could well determine W&L’s success.

The starting goalie spot is also
being hotly contested. Bill Inger-
soll, though All-Conference last
year, is being hard-pressed by fresh-
man Skeet Chadwick, another All-
Maryland high-schooler last year.
Both have been impressive so far,
teaming with Charlie Robson for a
shut out against Roanoke, and al-
lowing 4 each against Yale. Either
appears totally capable of handling
the job.

AND

 

LaRue’s Press Box

A lot of things got cleared up this
past weekend in ‘basketball action
across the country. Among other de-
velopments, South Carolina eeked
out a two point victory over rival
North Carolina for the Atlantic
Coast Conference championship in
a game seen by many on the tube.
And out west, UOLA settled once
and for all who is Number One, at
least in the Pacific Bight Conference.

Meanwhile, Jacksonville blew a
seventeen point lead in falling to
Western Kentucky. Houston, which
had earlier posted a one-point regu-
lar season win over the Florida
school, had its hands full with pesky
New Mexico in a Midwest contest.

In other action, Brigham Young
topped ‘Utah State, Fordham stomp-
ed Furman, Long Beach State rolled
past Weber, and Penn topped Duq-
uesne. In a Missouri Valley play-
off Drake rallied to conquer Louis-
ville and take the title.

All of which sets up some gems
for Thursday's regionals. For the
East, undefeated Penn takes on the
newly crowned ACC champion
Gamecocks and Villanova battles
Fordham. In the Mideast, in what
has to be one of the colossal en-
counters of the year, Adolph Ripp’s
Kentucky squad meets Western Ken-
tucky. The added attraction of Mar-
quette, the nation’s only other major
undefeated team, against Ohio State
makes Athens, Georgia the place to
be Thursday.

Meanwhile, Notre Dame and Aus-
tin Carr take on Drake while Hous-
ton goes against Big Eight champion
Kansas in the Midwest division. And
at Salt Lake City, the Cougars of
Brigham Young oppose top-ranked
UCLA, with Long Beach State and
the University of the Pacific clash-
ing in the nightcap.

 

NCAA Regionals, Finals

 

The winners advance to the re-
gional finals to be held Saturday,
with the surviving four teams head-
ing to the Astrodome for the finals
March 25 and 27.

Going out on a limb, we see
South Carolina handing Penn its
first loss and advancing to face Ford-
ham, the victor over Villanova, for
the Bastern laurels.

The Baron of the Bluegrass will
meet defeat as Western Kentucky
will advance to test Marquette’s
perfect skein. The University of
‘Houston will fall victim to Kansas,
while Notre Dame disposes of Drake.
UCLA is the natural choice over
‘Brigham Young with Long Beach
downing Pacific,

What happens from there is pure
speculation, but from this writer’s
view, the year’s tourney games are
not nearly as unpredictable as they
have been in years past. Barring any
upsets the only close game looks
to be that battle for the champion-
ship of Kentucky.

On the national level, track en-
thusiasts are buzzing about Jim
Ryan’s comeback. A bit closer to
home, the Washington and Lee com-
munity would do well to take note
of the comeback of its own track
program.

For the past couple of seasons,
the track and field program has been,
well, “informal.” However, _ this
spring the outlook is one of opti-
mism and enthusiasm,

The reasons for this dramatic

about face are two fold. Firstly, the
coaching is now the duty of two
very capable and dedicated men—
Coaches Aldridge and Stearns. Out
of a heretofore individual sport
they have begun to create a deal of
team unity and spirit in track. We
now have a track team, not a bunch
of individuals doing what they feel
like doing.

The second reason for this new
look is, of course, the performers
themselves. Never before has the
team been so blessed with the out-

 

Bill Brumback and Bim Clark both have qualified for the NCAA Col-
lege Division finals in swimming to be held this weekend at Springfield,
Mass. Brumback will be participating in his two specialities, the 50 and
100 yard freestyle, while Clark will swim the 50 freestyle and 100
butterfly.

Hard Schedule

The Generals, who enjoyed their
ibest season in history last year by
winning eight of 11 games, will play
six games at home this year, begin-
ning with Randolph-Macon on Sat-
urday, March 20, at 2:00 p.m.

Two other important games fol-
low the next week. On Monday,
‘March 22, W&L will host a group of
touring English College All-Stars.
These players represent the best la-
crosse players at Oxford, Cambridge,
Sandhurst, Liverpool and other Eng-
lish universities.

On Wednesday, March 24, W&L
will meet Dartmouth, always a tough
Ivy League competitor. The final
home game, on May 15 against
Duke, could well be for the South
Atlantic division chanypionship.

Head Coach Dick Szlasa is ex-
ipecting big things from the W&L
lacrosse team. Nearly everyone re-
turns from last year’s squad, and
will be joined by some top-notch
freshmen from the Baltimore area,
the nation’s hotbed of lacrosse.

Included are four boys who play-
ed in the high school All-Star Game
which preceded the college game last
June: goal-keepers Chuck St. Clair
and Skeet Chadwick and midfielder
Skip Lichtfuss of the Baltimore area,
and defenseman Bob Turco, who
played for the victorious New Jersey
All-Stars.

Among the veterans returning are
defenseman Bill Brumback, a first
team All-American selection last
year; midfielder Whit Morrill, a
third team All-American; and the
team’s two leading scorers, Sam En-
glehart (35 goals) and Scott Neese
(12 goals, 26 assists).

The Generals have some very im-
portant games on the road, includ-
ing contests against two of the three
national champions last year, Navy
and University of Virginia, and the
defending division champion, North
Carolina’s Tarheels. Ail games will
be at Wilson Field. There is no ad-
mission charge.

Doubleheader Opens Year

BY PALMER TRICE

Once again, we can hear that ery
in the sky, “Play ball!” Spring train-
ing is over for the Generals, and
the season is at hand. Coach Joe
Lyles and his squad hit the diamond
for real, and for the opening game
of the 1971 campaign this Saturday.
The season commences with a home
doubleheader with Long Island Uni-
versity. The opening day pitchers
have yet to be announced.

This year’s team should be both
“interesting and exciting.” The Gen-
erals will go with a fine infield, com-
posed of Bo Brookby at the hot

RUGBY NOTICE

Both games will be played at 1:30.

corner, Doug Clelan at short, Jim
Nolan at second, and Fred Paone at
first. The outfield will consist of
Captain Ray Coates, Bob LaRue,
and Dave Traylor. Jerry Johnson, a
freshman, has shown potential be-
hind the plate. The pitching staff
should be good, but lacks depth.
This, plus a lack of left handed hit-
ters, will be the two most pressing
problems for this year’s Generals.
Coach Lyles says that the talent is
there, but much of it is fresh, as he
lost nine players from last year’s
team, four of whom were due to
graduate.

done in the Executive Committee,
but this will not be a problem next
year. Once people are informed, it's
up to each individual to get involved,

However, a problem even more
crucial to life at W&L than the
complete apathy of some, is the ten-
dency of many others, to cfitiaize
things and not be prepared to do
something about it. Many people sit
back and take potshots at the E.C.,
Ring-tum Phi, Student Control Com-
mittee, or anything else at W&L
that bothers them, This is fine, to an
extent, for obviously there are many
alterations to various aspects of life
here that could be made. But the
complainers should be prepared to
do something about the things that
upset them in add'tion to their criti-
cizing .The perpe.uat fault-finder can
always find something to complain
about, but 1. is the truly concerned
individual that ‘dons something about
it. There is no place for the time-
worn phrases “I don’t want to get
involved,” or “I don’t have the
time.” There is too much that can
be done, with the new governmental
structure, if proper student support
is obtained.

So I say now is the time, for the
opportunity is here, to do something,
if we are ever to get anything done
in student government. There are
many problems facing the University
and its students, and it is going to
take the support and help of these
students to find the solutions.

cast to pull off a trick upon the audi-
ence. “Swan Song” is a dangerous,
difficult play to perform; Stack and
Reed perform it with much success.

The climax of the evening is “The
Boor,” directed by Carr Garnett.
Chekhov attributed the success of
this play to what he called “stupid
vaudeville.” Perhaps the playwright
is right about productions in Russia,
but Garnett’s direction and the per-
formance of his cast has made his
show |uman “vaudeville” and ex-
tremely funny.

The “Boor” who comes to the
house of a mourning widow is play-
ed brilliantly by Skip Paukert. The
comedy of his performance is con-
trolled and his timing throughout is
skillful. He establishes his character
from the moment he walks onto the
stage and plays believably with
Donna Shanklin, the widow. As Po-
pova, Miss Shanklin has a depth
which the subtle aspects of her
comic character requires, though her
broad comedy is a trifle overdone.
As her servant, Looka, Michael
Peppler has developed an hilarious
character. His reactions to the Boor
are subtle enough to make one of
his exits the closest thing to a show-
stopper in the play.

Garnett has done an admirable
job of interpreting “The Boor;” he
has evidently worked with his ac-
tors for believability in a play which
could very easily degenerate into not-
so-comic mugs at the audience. Greg
Buch’s set for the production is the
best of the five plays offered by the
student directors, but its effective-
ness is in the use Garnett makes of
the world which Buch has created.

on the rolls to look seriously for
employment: those receiving welfare
will, by and large, continue to re-
ceive it due to their own comfort and
the willingness of the social workers
to crack down and relieve the over-
burdened taxpayer of yet another
drag to his pecuniary advancement.

Cutting welfare off for someone in
the “able-but-unwilling” category
sounds cruel—but it would sharpen
their wits and senses as they pound
the pavement in search of that work
so many of us find vital to our sur-
vival. It would make far better citi-
zens of them, it would aid the com-
munity, it would contribute to the
general well-being, and it would
ease a portion of the complaints at
the exorbitant size of government
spending.

It is not always easy to do the re-
sponsible thing, yet the responsible
thing is always the simplest in the
long run. A strict pruning of the
welfare rolls would be harsh, but its
benefits would be more than com-
pensatory, and the effect on the indi-
vidual involved would turn him from

Additional men to watch are fresh-

a_ useless parasite into a contribut-

Realizing employment is honestly
not always available, understanding
the difficulty of finding suitable
training, and comprehending the
stubborn runs of bad luck one can
have, this is not a call for a total
and definite dissolution of the dole
structure, but rather an attempt for
government to be more conscious of
the moral damage it does in support-
ing some worker who could find
work is it were not for the comfort
and ease of obtaining welfare. We
should cut back the structure that
exists now, we should aim at eventu-
ally erecting a more workable sys-
tem—but above all we should realize
that the financial dependence we
now give these on the dole destroys
the honour in a man and turns him
into no more than a slave whose
soul and body are shackled to the
overpowering bureaucracy of the
state,

Sha-Na-Na Coming;
Will Play Saturday
(Continued from Page 1)
Saturday afternoon will see the
17th ranked Washington and Lee la-
crosse team open its season on Wil-

son Field against Randolph-Macon.
With virtually everyone intact from

ast year’s fabulous stick team, the

Generals should be even more of a

poewrhouse this season. Randolph-

Macon’s team is a young one, as the
school has only recently taken up the
sport, but Yellow Jacket teams can
always be counted upon to give the
Blue a battle. Game time is set at
2:00 p.m.

On Saturday night a Sha-Na-Na
Weekend Date Night will be spon-
sored in Evans Dining Hall from
5:45-6:30 pm. The ARA Service
which runs Commons is featuring a
special meal in conjunction with the
Dance Board. Candlelight dinners
will include: tomato juice, London
broil (carved to order), whipped po-
tatoes, buttered whole kernels of
corn, green peas with mushrooms,
hot rolls with butter, tossed salad,
peach shortcake and beverages. The
Cost is $1.00 per couple for contract
students and $3.50 for non-contract
couples. Tickets are available at
Evans Dining Hall, Hurry because
the first 100 dates get a fresh flower
from the friendly folks at Commons.

And what would a weekend be
without a cocktail party? The junior
class will sponsor such an undertak-
ing Saturday afternoon in Red
Square 2:00-6:00 p.m. In case of
rain the event will be moved to the
Pavilion.

Steve Robinson, chairman of the
Student Recruitment Committee ap-
peared with a request for funds from
the EC. Robinson said a $5,000
grant had ‘been received for scholar-
ships. He hoped that another $500
could be raised from students and
organizations on the W&L campus.
Senior Representative Staman Ogil-
vie recommended that Robinson
check with class presidents for pos-
sible contributions. The EC took no
action with the understanding that
Robinson would appear later with
further details.

Lex McMillan, chairman of the
Curriculum Committee attended the
meeting with information about the
faculty evaluation being conducted
by his committee. A questionnaire
has been prepared, MoMillan report-
ed. The committee plans to mail
these questionnaires to one third of
the student body. By a unanimous
vote the EC allocated $50 to the

summer volunteer program, but the
only job available to these people
would be recruiting and organizing.
The reason for the emphasis on the
one-year program is that a high level
of commitment is necessary if one is

to be effective.

Although this is principally a vol-
unteer program, lack of funds should
not prevent anyone from applying.
VWRO will help volunteers raise
money to pay for living expenses
during the period of service. Cam
Crockett from Hollins raised money
for her summer service by holding
a “poor persons dinner” banquet.

The first meeting of all prospec-
tive volunteers will be March 25, at
which time the program will be ex-
plained in detail, biterature will be
handed out, and a VISTA film will
be shown. Then, until summer, the
volunteers will determine their train-
ing program, which should consist of
discussions, workshops, study and
practical training in the community.
Where the volunteer will be assigned
will be determined between the vol-
unteer and WRO. This may or may
not include areas around Lexington.
There will be more information
about the meeting next week and the
program posted on campus. For any
other details call: Kurt Krumperman
at 463-3885.

To conclude, active work is the
only way to solve the problems that
face us, The volunteer program of
VWRO is one means to help solve
the problem of poverty.

first place honors in the overall scor-
ing.
At the Johns Hopkins Invitational
Tournament in late January, W&L
entered two four man teams which
ranked fifth and ninth in the com-
petition between approximately 50
schools from 15 states. Sophomore
Co-captain Bob Bruyere placed
tenth out of one-hundred in indivi-
dual speaker competition, at the
same tournament,

Mentined by the captains as stand-
outs with this year’s team were
freshmen Tom Beard, Byran Mc-
Neil, Lennie Kaufman, and Averill
Harkey, sophomore Larry Evans,
junior Cal Seaton, and senior Bill
Radigan. The captains also felt that
a lot of the credit for the team’s per-
formance this year goes to Coach
Halford Ryan, who is in his first
year with Washington and Lee de-
bate.

Things look good for W&L de-
bate in the future. As sophomore
Co-captain Andy Bradshaw con-
cluded, “With a team made up pri-
marily of freshman and sophomores,
only one junior and one senior, we
show a lot of potential for the fu-
ture. Our debate team has been na-
tionally ranked consistently in the
past, and I think we can be up there
again in a year or two.”

ELECTION RESULTS—

JUNIOR CLASS

Executive Committee

After the EC emerged from a long-
thy vote-counting session Monday
evening, it was revealed that Bill
Merrill of the rising junior class and
Mike Brittin of the rising sophomore
class were the only two EC candi-

koff won over Larry Evans. In sop-
homore voting Steve Greene was vic-
torious over Durant Ashmore. All
other offices are yet undetermined.

In the EC slot two votes were cast
by each person, therefore requiring

The pledge is not a contract. If a Vice-President For Programs

pledge, for any reason, is not in-
cluded on work turned in as your
own work, that work is still assumed
to be pledged. That is, the work is
assumed to be done under the Honor
System.

The “traditional” written pledge
serves as a reminder to students that
academic work put forth as their
own must, in fact, be their own. The
EC felt (a bit belatedly) that the
printed pledge used last term was
a different sort of pledge—that it
tended to be a legal contract of
some sort. More importantly the
pledge seeemed to say that certain
statements, whether or not they actu-
ally constituted cheating, were them-
selves Honor Violations.

This becomes, in effect, a rule.
The Honor System would have to be
rewritten to include “lying, cheat-
ing, stealing, and talking after ex-
aminations.” Once we begin to make
specific rules within the Honor Sys-
tem, we will have to make endless
rules covering every possible situa-
tion. Very soon, these rules would
prechude all individual consideration.

Judgment would be unnecessary—
but we would all have to memorize
rule books hundreds of pages long,
and ignorance would be no excuse.
The poim seems, to me, to be a
simple one. What is—or is not—ly-
ing, cheating, or stealing, to one de-
gree or another, involves an indivi-
dual’s judgment.

The Executive Committee is elect-
ed as representative of general stu-
dent feeling, and is elected to use its
good judgment in possible Honor
Violations. This is a personal system
of justice, not an impersonal one. It
demands people, not computers.

The original problem with Inde-
pendent Exams, the one that led to a
new pledge in the beginning, was
that the Independent Examinations
were to be given to more than one
section of students. Our habits are
pretty strong, and we are used to
“cokd” exams. The printed pledge
wus supposed to remind students of
the fact that the exams were “hot.”
But it did more; it presented that re-
minder in the form of a contract,

Then the debate begins—what
about “Value Judgments?” Does the
“contract” allow them? I still have
mo answer to that question, except
that it doesn't matter what you do
as long as you don't cheat by giving
someone aid ON an cAamination or
receiving Ht yourself

Probably some comments about
examinations do not give any aid
they would not be a violation of the
Honor System. This must be decided
on an individual basis, We all have
to make a special effort, however,
not to give information on the exam
to a student who has not taken the
same exam, It creates a predicament
for everyone involved

The easiest policy m to heep Our
mouths completely shut. Another
reason for this is that, although some
hall comments on examinations
may not be Honor Violations, they
nay cause the Independent Exam
program to be dropped. The faculty
understandably, would prefer thal no
comments whatsoever be made
about the finals

Keeping silent will work to insure
nivaniage of whe
cxaminations. For

ihat we keep the

this reason, the BC encourages su
dents to make no comments ai all

pertinent employment experience (if
any) on W&L publications. These
resumes should be in outline form

and should not inchide plans,
thoughts, ideas, or proposals, which
are to be presented to the Board in

The required personal appearances
before the Board are expected to be
brief and relevant. Presentations, at
the option of the applicant, may be
accomplished by written outlines of
plans, thoughts, ideas, and proposals.
If this is done—and it usually is—
the applicant should bring ten copies
of this material to the election.

Bookstore Will Present Boyden;
Photos By Goodridge On Exhibit

If you like to listen to folksongs
over a warm cup of coffee, or if you
prefer to browse through a collec-
tion of photographs, the fare on
campus is excellent this week.

Tonight in the Bookstore, Beedle
Boyden, a sophomore at Hollins,
will sing folksongs—some of which
are outs on her two albums which
will be released soon

Miss Boyden taught herself to
play the guitar and picked up songs
as she went along, many of which
she has played for area groups

The gathering at the Bookstore

will be “sit-on-the4loor,” according
to its manager, Mrs. Betty Munger.

Room 112 of the University Cen-
ter will be open throughout this
week. Of course, that is nothing ex-
ceptional, except for the exhibit of
photography on display.

Jim Goodridge’s show is a study
of natural scenes, many of which are
of the Lexington area. The display is
a first for Goodridge, a senior from
Fairfield, Conn. whose major is art
history

His exhibit will be open for brows
ing through the first of next week

In an attempt to channel interest-
ed students into community activi-
ties during the spring term the Uni-
versity Federation has begun a re-
cruitment drive. There has long been
a lack of communication and under-
standing between the university and
the community, with each side su-
spect of the other. A major purpose
of these programs, thus, is to im-
prove relations between the com-
munity and the school and through
mutual cooperation to better meet
some of the needs of the area.

Two programs already in exis-
tence are the Western State weekly
visits and the Big Brother Program,
co-sponsored with the county proba-
tion department. Every week stu-
dents travel to Western State Mental
Hospital to visit the patients and
help them in any way they can. Per-
haps the most successful attempt at
coordination between the school and
the county to date is the Big Brother
Program. Originally the program
was aimed at poverty level, jeuvenile
delinquents, but due to the response
from the student body (far more
than anyone had originally hoped
for) the program is currently being
expanded through the county wel-
fare department. Hence, even more
students will be needed.

Iwo other programs that are cur-
rently being organized are the hous-
ing repair group and the physically
handicapped children’s program.
Over one third of the housing in
Rockbridge County is in dilapidated
condition. The purpose of the hous-
ing repair group is to help make
some of these homes more liveable
through minor repair of them. This
program will be run with the assis-
tance of the county welfare depart-
ment. It is envphasized that one does
not need prior carpentry experience
to work with the group. Due to the
expanse of the county and the lack
of available transportation, the phy-
sically handicapped children of the
county often become isolated. The
purpose of this program is to help
these children get back into the com
munity and by working with them
to develop their individual talents

For all students interested in any
of the above programs there will be
a meeting on Thursday, March 25 at
7:00 in Room 208 in the Student
Center. If you are interested, but
cannot attend this meeting, call Bob
Foley (463-6268)

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
March 24, 1971

The Executive Committee:
On The Road Back

After its March 15 meeting, the Executive Committee
finally put its collective finger back on the pulse of the Honor
System. To the right is the text of their memo to the faculty
regarding the change in the pledge’s wording on the front of
the envelope. The usual pledge will now be used during the
exam period.

We felt that this move was the wisest possible course lor
that body to take in the first place, instead of the brief tangle
in words which clouded the issue of the future of the Honor
System, not to mention the future of independent exams.

" We urge each student to read the text of that memo, keep-
ing in mind that it stands as a guideline from the EC regarding
the Honor System during the independent examination period.

W&L’s Do-It-Yourself
Wallpaper Men

Usually an editor writes “don’t walk on the grass” or
“more paperbacks, please” editorials when he’s run out of
topics to fill up this column. :

We haven't. However, we cannot let this endless series ot
elections pass by without commenting upon what we feel is
one of the most absurd manifestations of election time at
W&L: the posters.

Each spring the buildings on campus are wallpapered with
all sorts of brightly colored sheets of paper, all looking curi-
ously the same. This spring has been no different except for
those industrious few who have taken upon themselves the
task of papering each building with large white sheets of paper
which are no doubt more effective advertising, but are just as
effectively absurd.

Whether or not one agrees that W&L's campus is hand-
some is not really a point for dispute. But we think no building
has much to offer in the way of aesthetics if its walls are blott-
ed with posters. Each one looks like an adolescent with a bad
skin problem. Is this what the admissions office wants pro-
spective students to view when they visit the campus in the
spring? We doubt it.

Some may argue that these posters are necessary to keep
the student body election-minded. Perhaps so. But if one looks
objectively at the impression those posters create, he probably
would conclude that close to half the school was on a campaign
to promote pollution or their egos.

Several months ago Fran Lawrence made a few remarks
on the trampling of the grass on campus. This is a lost cause
as far as we can see, although a valiant effort is being made
by the groundsmen to patch together the back campus. So
now students will walk on the straw.

Walking on the grass seems to have become a tradition
here: we don’t see how the EC is going to do away with that
one. But Fran Lawrence and the Executive Committee could
ban the posters.

In place of the posters (which, by the way, we think are an
ineffectual means of candidate promotion at best), we sug-
gest that the EC make provision for boards about campus
upon which the names of the candidates could be listed along
with their real qualifications—instead of the oftused promo
tags of “experience” or “leadership.” Candidates would be
able to distribute letters or other printed handouts to the stu-
dents which outlined their platforms and their desires.

As far as keeping the student body election-minded, The
Ring-tum Phi seems to serve that purpose. When possible
(and it almost always is possible) the newspaper prints a
slate of the candidates for each office in an election.

Apart from all considerations of aesthetics, we think the
concept of posters is immature. We suppose it’s one of the
grand American traditions to advertise one’s name in an elec-
tion. But the way which W&L candidates have gone about
supporting that tradition is high schoolish,

We think the EC ought to do away with the posters, Next
vear’s election should be controlled by the Executive Commit
tee so that posters on buildings will be at least one tradition
the EC did away with that won't be missed.

“The Student Executive Com-
mittee appreciates your patience
and understanding in the follow-
ing matter. In its meeting Mon-
day night (March 15) the Execu-
tive Committee passed over-
whelmingly (nine to one) a reso-

lution including the following
statement:

“Students should disregard the
pledge as printed on the outside
of the Independent Examination
envelope. Instead, the EC re-
quests that the usual pledge on
written work be used in its place:
“On my honor as a Washington
and Lee gentleman, I pledge that
I have neither given nor received
aid on this examination.” ’

“The resolution also reminds
students that final examinations
are given to more than one sec-
tion, and therefore should be
considered “hot” throughout the
examination period. In addition,
the Executive Committee reminds
students that all work submitted
for a grade is considered under
the Honor System, regardless of
how the pledge is worded or
whether it is omitted.

“Our decision is based upon
careful examination of the pledge
on the Independent Exam envel-
Ope over the past several weeks.
In our discussion with the Fac-
ulty EC we found that many of
the problems of interpretation
arose from the technical and le-
galistic nature of that pledge.

“The present examination
pledge tends to legalize and codi-
fy the Honor System and there-

Memo To The Faculty

fore is incompatable with the
basic and simple concept that a
Washington and Lee man does
not lie, cheat or steal.

“Possible violations of this
code must be dealt with on an in-
dividual basis. The EC believes
that the present pledge on the
exam envelope tends to restrict
individual judgment on the part
of students and the basic inter-
pretive powers of the EC in mat-
ters pertaining to Honor,

“It is for these reasons that we
delete the printed pledge on the
envelope, and substitute the tra-
ditional pledge. The special na-
ture of final examinations (that
they are not cold) has been, and
will continue to be, impressed
upon the student body as well as
the fact that it is living under an
Honor System not a_ specific
pledge, that requires students to
refrain from giving or receiving
information on academic work.

“We realize that this resolution
may cause some confusion on the
part of students and faculty. We
apologize for this inconvenience
and will take the following steps
to inform the University of these
changes.

1. Explanations cards to be dis-
tributed with the examination.

2. A similar explanation posted
across campus.

3. Articles in
Phi.

4. An EC manned information
table.

ence and hope for your coopera-
tion.

Letters
To the Editor

Welfare: ‘Very Tiresome’

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

How tiresome—the second Ring-
tum Phi article in as many weeks
on poverty and welfare and who-
knows-what-all. Or rather, how very
tiresome. Another legacy of the elec-
tion campaign of 1960.

Will today’s students believe, or
can they imagine, that in the Fifties
we weren't Obsessed with “the poor?”
But then perhaps each decade gets
the fad it deserves.

So “let ‘em eat cake,” as the queen
didn’t really say, but should have.
The point was elaborated more ele-
gantly later on by the greatest wit of
the nineteenth century, whose sound
advice might well be directed to our
own terribly serious, terribly “com-
mitted,” and terribly “concerned”
young zealots of “social justice” or
whatever.

“Realize,” he said, “your youth
while you have it. Don’t squander the
gold of your days, listening to the
tedious, trying to improve the hope-
less failure, or giving away your life
to the ignorant, the common, and
the vulgar.

“These are the sickly aims, the
faise modern sympathy with pain.
One should sympathize with the
color, the beauty, the joy of life.
The less said about life’s sores the
better... . |Our] century has gone
bankrupt through an over-expendi
ture of sympathy.”

Dance Board Needs Fee

lo the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Your editorial on the Dance Board
was well stated. | was especially
happy to note your treatment of criti
cism of an entertainment fee. If
anyone still has dowbts about the
justifications for such a fee, please
count the number of Giee Club con
certs, Troub productions, or debate
tournaments you have attended this
year.

These three organizations are
funded by the Student Activities Fee,
and rightly so. The source of the
SAF is cach student's tuition, A per
centage is given each year to the
EC for disbursement to the various
groups listed in Article LX, Section
B. 2

During the recent Constitutional
Convention, | proposed that the
Dance Board be added to the list of
groups receiving money from the
SAF. The motion was defeated be
couse of doubts expressed as to
whether the new constitution would
be accepted with it inchided, (As we
now have witnessed, the content of
the proposed constitution was of

little matter.)
Nevertheless, | still stand behind
the argumem that if other student

orgnizations are subsidized through
mandatory contributions, whether it
be a required fee (Contact) or thro
ugh the SAF, the Dance Board
should receive the same treatment
It then could serve all of the student

Exam Pledge ‘Mint-Crisis’ Dies;
Deadlock Broken With Pledge

BY DOUG BURTON

What appears to have been a tech-
nical snag in the system here has
grown into a mini-crisis threatening
the future of independent examina-
tions.

The problem arose after a poll last
year indicated that perhaps 75% of
the students taking final exams under
the IE schedule had heard comments
on the order of “value” judgments
and that 11% had heard comments
on test questions.

Were the wholesale violations evi-
dence of widespread contempt for
the honor system? Most students and
faculty agree with Fran Lawrence
that the stated pledge was misunder-
stood by most students. This is sug-
gested by the fact that 93% of the
people polled on the honor system
noted that they were under no un-
usual strain in relation to the honor
system.

[he question remaining in the
minds of many professors is wheth-
er or not the efficacy of exams are
not compromised when the pledge is
so misunderstood. The Executive
Committee of the faculty decided a
couple of weeks ago to bring the
matter to the faculty at large.

Dr. Robert McAhren, who says
he has more faith than anybody in
the honor of W&L gentleman, draft-
ed at that time a new pledge for this
term’s exam envelopes which includ-
ed the following clause, “I under-
stand that I (am obligated) to avoid
even the most general communica-
tions touching upon this examina-
tion’s difficulty, length, or other
characteristics.”

It was rejected by the EC,

Members of the Faculty EC are
quick to tell you that they have noth-
ing to do with the exam pledge or
with honor violations. The instru-
mentality of the pledge is of great
importance to them, however, since
they alone will bring the matter of
independent examinations before the
faculty, and in fact, have the author-
ity to abolish the LE schedule them-
selves.

Student Body President Fran Law-
rence and the EC have now gone
back to the traditional W&L pledge.
For the text of an explanatory memo
to the faculty, see the box on this
page.) He had this to say on the
spirit of General Lee’s dictum in
1971;

“What we have discovered recent-
ly is that the faculty know damn
little about what the honor system
means.

“It is really very sinyple. The basis
of the honor system is that a Wash-
ington and Lee man does not lie,
cheat or steal. Within this context a
person can say all kinds of things
about a test and not reveal informa-
tion. The three part pledge tended to
codify and place limits on what a
student could and could not do,
leaving him no room for personal
judgment.

“The honor system works on a
mystical basis, finally, but it works.
There is no scientific basis for deter-
mining what is cheating and what
isn’t. Unfortunately most faculty are
academicians enough to see every
thing in terms of black and white.”

 

To many alumni, Washington and Lee means “fraternity,” but in the past three years, the fraternity system at
WAL has been weakened by the depletion in membership rolls. The Kappa Sigma chapter here was no exception.

Letters
To th Editor

The Dance Board Fee
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

At the risk of being accused of
caring what goes on in this school,
1 would like to comment on your
proposed social fee.

You draw a parallel between your
proposed tax and the Contact fee
which I don’t think is entirely valid.
First of all, the effect of the Contact
fee is minimal while a $25 to $30
social fee would bode ill for many
a pocketbook. Secondly, Contact
and other functions under the acti-
vities fee, with the possible excep-
tion of the conypulsory nostalgia of
The Calyx, are in some way educa-
tional in nature; dances are not.

But even if the both arguments
above were completely untrue, I
dislike the premises of your argu-
ment. You are saying that since con-
cert-goers seem unwilling to give un-
qualified support to the Dance Board,
that support must be forced from
them and from their fellow students
who have no interests in such non-
essential, but pleasureable, activities.

The solution is to quit selling tic-
kets at the door. Then those inter-
ested in concerts could cast their $40
Dance Plan votes. If not enough
money is gathered, a refund could
be made.

Imagine the reaction of students
if, given the situation above, The
Ring-tum Phi suggested, “People do
not seem to want to support the
Dance Board, therefore everyone
should ‘be forced to buy what they
have shown they don’t want.” Any-
way you throw the dice (returning
to your gambling analogy), the con-
cert-goers win and the non-attenders
lose. The Dance Board may be gam-
bling but it certainly has better odds
than you are offering us. I'd just as
soon you pay for your own enter-
tainment, thank you.

rkly...

own abilities and reduced to impri-
sonment although we have the means
—but not the desire—to free our-
selves. And yet the tremendous and
overwhelming power of the central
authorities in Washington, the less
efficient ‘but no less pre-possessing
state governments, and even the local
communities, have erected a power
structure that stifles liberty and
replaces the freedom of the indivi-
dual with the repressive security of
the state.

We have the means to throw off
these bonds that fetter our liberty,
yet we as a nation prefer the shame
of slavery to the maturity of free-
dom. We have many remnants of
our lost rights, but these are not the
kernel of individual liberty that once
brought our parents over 3,000 miles
to escape the despotism of the past.

I can condemn the authoritarian
statism of the central government—
this is a remnant of freedom of the
press. Yet I still am forced to pay
the exorbitant taxes the government
demands from me, I still am regu-
lated in the food I eat, in the cars J
drive, and in the clothes I wear.

I still am controlled in a manner
that is appalling to any person who
desires liberty and finds freedom
the most precious part of life. We
are bent, stamped, and mutilated; we
are ordered, forbidden, and directed;
we are deprived of our most basic
rights while the government pena-
lizes the successful and succors the
incompetent from the just result of
their incompetency.

In short, we no longer are free
men, but are the creatures of a state
both omniscient and omnipotent,
whose interests are paramount and
who tramples the rights of the many
for the sake of its own existence.

In spite of this governmental pre-
ponderance, there is still a measure
of hope for free Americans. Our
most important right—that of the
‘ballot—has been the last one the
statists have dared to tamper with,
and it is still in our power to vote out
those centralizing politicoes who
have tried so successfully to destroy
the individual liberties of free citi-
zens.

The realization of our encroach-
ing slavery and the knowledge that
we may by a joint effort remove
these obnoxious fetters, are the only
road we have toward a restoration
of freedom: the effort may well be
in vain at this late date, but we can
only wager all that we have in hope
of returning to free agents the liber-
ties of our heritage.

BY JEFFREY B. SPENCE

It is always interesting to watch
the varied machinations of both the
left and the right wings as they go
about their programs for the salva-
tion of America. It seems like every-
body has a ready-made solution for
the ills that beset us. Unfortun-
ately most of these solutions end in
creating more problems. What is
more interesting are the basic incon-
gruities that tend to get entangled
with the high ideals of the onganiza-
tions on both ends of the political
spectrum,

One of the incongruities 1 speak
of concerns the attitude that these
groups have towards government in-
tervention into the lives of the citi-
zenry. It appears as if both sides op-
pose it. The right wing does not want
intervention into the private enter-
prise sector on such programs as wel-
fare. Yet, this same group of rugged
individualists wants our country to
spend ever greater amounts of
money so that a central government
(the state) will be able to defend us
from all the evil communists.

Washington and Lee Passes
Century Since Name-Change

One hundred years ago last week,
Washington College in Lexington
took for itself a new name. It was
on March 16, 1871, that the little
school’s trustees officially authorized
the change from “Washington Col-
lege” to “Washington and Lee Uni-
versity.”

Lee had died on campus on Octo-
ber 12, 1870. On the day that he
was buried in the small chapel that

bears his name and that has since be-
come a national shrine, the college's
faculty had resolved to petition the
Virginia legislature for permission
to rename the school.

They reasoned that “the name of
this institution may hereafter ever
express in fit conjunction the im-
mortal names of Washington and
Lee whose lives were so similar in
their perfect renown and with both

of whom equally, by singular good
fortune, it is entitled to be associat-
ed in its future history.”

According to the late Dr. Ollin-
ger Crenshaw, in his history, Gen-
eral Lee’s College, the Virginia Gaz-
ette was quick to endorse the change
of name, along with the appointment
of Lee’s son Custis to the presi-
denoy. The paper reasoned that Lee,
more than anyone else had been re-
sponsible for the growth of college
into University.

Lee had attracted an outstanding
faculty to the college with his arri-
val, and had also leant his own per-
sonal reputation to recruit top stu-
dents, not only from the south, but
from throughout a country that had
been torn apart by war.

New programs in education were
also sponsored by the general turned
university president. Lee added the
law school division, along with a
schoo! of engineering to blend with
the school’s traditional liberal arts
curriculum. Lee first conceived of
an undergraduate business school,
and it was under his guidance that

With Malice Toward Some
Government Steps In

 
   

The left wing wants the ever-
reaching power of the central gov-
ernment to stop all its intervention
militarily, in both foreign and do-
mestic affairs. Yet, they want that
very same government to spend
large amounts of money on an ever-
growing welfare program. It is get-
ting difficult to know what these
politicos want. Do they want more
or less government? It seems like
they do not know what they want.

Unfortunately, the left wing has
ibrought one of their incongruities
into our campus community and it
has presented us with a very serious
situation. The left has recently been
very upset by the invasion of the
government's military organization
on to our private campus. Their dis-
tress has been made known through
their efforts to remove the credit
from R.O.T.C. and maybe remove
the entire program. This is a most
laudable effort. | wonder why they
then turn around and entice another
military agency of the government
on campus. This agency is the state
police force of Virginia, particularly
their narcotics division. The police
are being enticed by the ever-in-
creasing use and sale of illegal drugs.

I blame this on the left for some
specific reasons. They tend to be the
group both locally and on a national
scale who are the largest users and
dealers in the drug scene.

It seems to me that if these people
want to avoid intervention by the
“pigs” they would not carry on acti-
vities that could easily bring them
into our campus life. The university
that we attend is not and does not
consider itself to be a sanctuary
from the law. Therefore there is no
reason why anyone who attends
W&L should dare consider it to be a
safe place.

Gentlemen, believe me, the cops
are interested in what is happening
in the W&L drug scene. If the acti-
vities of those who believe drug use
to be their salvation do not cease
soon we can expect the possibility of
police intervention and investigation
to become a very real one. If “off the
pigs” is what you subscribe to or for
that matter a lesser version of the
same political line, then I ask you to
take stock of what you are doing: if
drugs are your thing. If and when the
bust comes please do not try and
create some moral upheaval then be-
cause it would only be ludicrous. In-
stead either cut down or cut out the
use of drugs altogether or else go to
work to change the law. Until the
law does change the “pigs” are going
to try and bust you. Peace.

Indiana Coach “Doc” Counsil-
man and his team, featuring Mark
Spitz, Gary Hall, and John Kinsella,
have been featured in the ourrent
Sports Illustrated and touted as the
unconquerable best in the forthcom-
ing NCAA University division meet.

Last weekend, however, Spring-
field, Massachusetts was the site of
the NCAA College Division finals,
and though Counsilman's squad was
not challenged, Washington and Lee
distinguished itself as both a home
for All-Americans and as the desig-
nated home of next year’s champion-
ship meet.

For the first time in the history of
the meeting, the W&L track team
appears to have been ready to seri-
ously challenge old nemesis Bridge-
water. In all the meetings between
ithe two teams the Blue has come out
runner-up. However, with the new
face of “Track ’71”", Coach Aldridge
figured on quite a meet yesterday.

the case against most opponents,

In closing out what was possibly
the most stellar career in W&L
swimming history, Senior Captain
Bill “Smack” Brumback, upstaged
his All American feats of last year.

As has been the case for the last
two seasons, he gained All-Ameri-
can status for his performance in his
speciality, the 50 yard freestyle. In
addition, Smack this year also placed
for All American honors in the 100
yard freestyle, setting a new W&L
record in the process,

Coach Bill Stearns was under-
standably proud of the Baltimore
Bullet. He observed it was a fitting

for a much improved mile relay

With this added dimension of

significance, should also serve no-

Stearns also had great praise for

After some of the turnabouts last
week, I’m really shaky about trying
to pick some winners in the NCAA
basketball finals. But with only three
games—the most crucial—left, I
might as well try.

The Villanova-Western Kentucky
match is just as hard to choose as
UCLA-Kansas. The Philadelphia-
based Wildcats first shocked Ford-
ham and then sent rival Penn reel-
ing with the gargantuan 43 point vic-
tory. The great thing that Villanova
has going for it is momentum. En-
joying their first appearance as an
NOAA finalist since 1939, the Wild-
cats only suit nine players.

Performance-wise, Western Ken-
tucky may be superior, but Villan-
ova’s Howard Porter is as hot as a
six-bit pistol. Western Kentucky,
though, has demonstrated its strength
with convincing victories over Ken-
tucky and Ohio State, the latter in
overtime. The Hilltoppers themselves
boast hot-shooting Jim McDaniel.

In the other big games, Kansas,
with memories of a national title in
1952 still rebounding in its head,
challenges a UCLA dynasty which
has lately been equated with the
New York Yankees of the 1950's.

Doremus To Host NCAA Swimming

ington and Lee athletic complex will

that W&L swimming owes its tre-

NCAA Basketball Predictions

Curiously, neither team was over-
ly impressive in regional action. The
Jayhawks beat Houston by one and
Drake by only a little more on the
way to Dome; meanwhile, the
Bruins, supposedly resting up for
the big ones, were last minute victors
over Long Beach State.

Next Saturday should find Wes-
tern Kentucky ‘battling UCLA for
the NCAA championship. In the
past, Bruin championships have been
as certain as death and taxes, But
Western will end this Bruin streak at
four.

And for those of you who braved
the snow to come see the W&L base-
ballers’ openers last Saturday, only
to find no one on the field, we thank
you, The cold weather and precipita-
tion from the night before forced
the cancellation of a scheduled dou-
bleheader with Long Island Univer-
sity.

Instead, our diamond crew played
a scrimmage game with LIU at VMI
Sunday, with better weather. The
Generals had opened the season with
St. Francis, winning the first game
while dropping the nightcap. And
thanks, too, to a good crowd that
showed up for those games.

Lacrosse Team Takes Two

Randolph-Macon
English All-Stars
Felled By Generals

BY RAY SWAN

The W&L Lacrosse team started
the season with two wins this week,
defeating Randolph-Macon 14-8, and
the English All-Stars 13-11.

Saturday’s game against R-M saw
the Yellow Jackets jump to a 3-1
lead in the first quarter. Hank Slaus-
son scored the General's lone goal
in the period.

In the second quarter, W&L ex-
ploded for five goals in six minutes
by Whit Morrill, John Lalley, Ted
Bauer, and two by Sam Englehart.
R-M retaliated with three goals in
the quarter to knot the score 6-6 at
halftime.

Three minutes into the third quar-
ter, Englehart broke the tie. Whit
Morrill and Ed Tognetti scored and
Englehart added another. R-M scor-
ed in the final minute of the quarter
to give the Blue a 10-7 lead.

Englehart again opened the scor-
ing in the fourth quarter but the
Yellow Jackets came back two min-
utes later with a goal, making the
score 11-8, Chip Tompkins, Bob
Brumback and Jim Farrar each scor-
ed to clinch the game for the Gen-
erals.

Sam Englehart led all scorers with
five goals. Scott Neese chalked up
five assists. Skeeter Chadwick started
in the goal. Bill Ingersoll took over
in the second half, helping to hold
R-M to two points in the half.

The English All-Stars proved to
be tougher than R-«M. The Blue

Fitzhugh, a junior transfer stu

the General hitting attack was weak,

loaded the bases

In the second game, the failure to
take advantage of numerous oppor
tunities was the Generals’ downfall
Ellie Gutshall started for WA&l
pitching 5 innings, allowing all the
runs on three hits and five walks.
All of the runs were unearned

Don McMillan came on in relief
ind pitched two perfect innings. The
Generals’ lone score came on a bases
loaded single in the sixth. One run
on that base hit was disallowed due
to an umpire’s ruling that third base
had not been touched

Four Veterans

Lead Golfers
This Season

Four veteran golfers will form the
nucleus for the 1971 Washington
and Lee University golf team which
faces a much tougher schedule this
spring.

The quartet is led by senior cap-
tain Ken Carter of New Orleans,
now beginning his fourth year on
the varsity. “If I had six Ken Car-
ters, we would do pretty well with
this schedule,” commented veteran
W&L golf coach E. P. (Cy) Twomb-
ly.

Carter will be joined by lettermen
Jack Marquess, Bill Martin and
Brandon Herbert. After that, three
non-lettermen and a raft of fresh-
men candidates are competing for
the remaining places on the team.

The non-lettermen are soph Phil
Milner, the no. 7 man last year;
Craig Williams, who didn’t play last
year but has shown steady improve-
ment; and Nim Long, a sophomore
transfer from Sewanee, where he
played no. 7 on the strong Tiger
team.

The Generals will open April 12
at Duke, one of four Atlantic Coast
Conference opponents on the cight-
match schedule. The others are
North Carolina, N. C. State and Vir-
ginia.

W&L Celebrates 100th Birthday

(Continued from Page 3)

Washington College became the site
of the first college journalism pro-
gram,

Few observers could probably pre-
dict such academic success when
Lee arrived at the college in 1865
Indeed, his very salary was being
paid with borrowed funds, a humble
$1500 for the first year. The little
school itself was poverty-stricken,
and, as Dr, Crenshaw points out,
the employment of military men in
higher education was, at that time,
rare. The presence of the former
Confederate general as an influence
on college students was also attack-
ed by some Northern newspapers
and politicians.

Foreseeing such criticism and
fearing that it might be deeply in-
jurious to Washington College, Lee
debated at length whether to accept
the position. Fittingly, in view of
the school’s eventual title, Washing-
ton’s life and service to country had
always been an abiding influence in
Lee’s own life. It is said that the

connection between the first Ameri-
can hero, who in 1798 had saved
the institution from extinction with
a $50,000 endowment, and the
school itself helped persuade Lee to
accept the presidency.

Perhaps the most enduring of his
contributions were those that were
intangible in nature. An overriding
precept was to foster reconciliation
between sections of the country, to
eradicate bitter feeling. It was under
Lee’s administration that the college
first became a national institution of
learning, represented ‘by students
from throughout the country.

In his personal conduct, and in his
aspirations for “his boys” at Wash-
ington College, nothing was more
important than expanding the capa-
city and desire of men to learn, to
understand, and to pass to the future
the fruits of this growth—all in an
atmosphere of individual integrity,
honor and responsibility.

That too endures today as a legacy
from Lee at the university which
was dead when he came to it and
which he made to live.

Are Fraternities ‘‘Essential’’ At W@L?

(Continued from Page 2)
look at campus life.

“I think this could re-vitalize fra-
ternities,” said Murov. “If our plan
is instrumented rush will be de-for-
malized so that, upon invitation a
freshman can come out to the house
at any time and could discuss any-
thing with an upperclassmen, out-
side McCormick Library and his
dorm room.”

But even if this new rush plan is
a smashing success, it may not be
enough to stay the anti-fraternity
course. The IFC statistics on current
membership indicate a serious drop-
out rate among upperclassman, and
this may be even more causal to fra-
ternity troubles.

“Fraternities must adapt to a
changing student body,” said La-
Rue.” Any system that can’t change
is a dinasour and will necessarily be-
come extinct.” LaRue pointed to the
food-buying plan initiated this year
iby the IFC as a step in the right di-
rection of cutting costs and provid-
ing better services. The effort this
year was, however, somewhat abor-
tive: the IFC complains of a lack of
co-operation on the part of some
houses and general community boy-
cotts by local merchants made the
implementation difficult.

“We're convinced that money can
be saved on some commodities,” ar-
gues LaRue. “Just about any system
would be an improvememt over the
present procedure of individual buy-
ing.”

Outgoing president of the IFC,
Doug Gossmann, hopes that frater-
nities might be able to cut costs by
sharing combos, “A big problem is
that many fraternities still want to
maintain their social autonomy and
this just isn’t practical,” he said.

Steve Robinson sees the problem
of social style closely-related to fra-
ternity survival. “Lots of houses

have parties just once a month, and

a freshman or upperclassman just
can't see sacrificing that new car for
simply one combo a month. Besides,
students are becoming more bored
with the traditional combo style.” A
strong fraternity will probably be
one that branches out with imagina-
tive alternatives,

It is also hoped, that under new
arrangements with a local account-
ing agent, fraternities will produce
better-managed books next year and
hopefully save wasted expenses by
stricter regulation of finances.

There is some question as to
whether there is really a serious hos-
tility between some students and
faculty members and the fraternity
system. “I think that the fraternity
remains basically attractive,” says
Gossmann. “And I think people ima-
gine more hostility than there really
is.” But Tom Mays, a former fra-
ternity man and a sophomore repre-
sentative on the EC disagrees: “Many
independents feel that they were
fooled when they went through rush,
and they feel lucky that they got out,
so that they will really close ranks
and tell freshmen what they think.”

Mays sees eventually a fraternity
membership at W&L levelling off at
about 30-35%, with a situation
roughly parallel to the status quo at
U.Va. now. “I think with fewer
houses on campus, being in a frater-
nity will, in fact, mean a regain of
identity between houses.”

In fact, as certain houses seem to
lose strength, no one seems really to
be weeping over the plight of the
system. Most fraternity leaders will
admit, matter-offactly, that if fra-
ternities have no function on camp-
us, then there is no reason for them
to remain. And most of them will
hasten to point out that the strong
houses will most certainly survive
for quite a while, preserving the cen-
tury—old tradition of fraternity life.

One encouraging fact for frater-
nities is that the IFC has seen greatly
improved leadership this year over
past times, and LaRue adds, “the
IFC has made tremendous strides
over their past image, embarking on
certain programs which were avoid-
ed in the past and attempting to im-
plement them in a somewhat more
mature manner. | know the faculty
and administration see this, and I
hope that they will recognize the ef-
forts that we're making.”

Steve Robinson seemed to sum up
the viewpoint of the fraternity ele-
ment, which has become increasing-
ly realistic and pragmatic in tone.
“As we draw more students to W&L
from more variam backgrounds, it
would be unfair to force the frater-
nity system on the incoming fresh-
men. A lot has been done for fra-
ternities by alumni and the brother-
hood, and its up to us now to decide
whether fraternities, and which fra-
ternities, are worth it... The strong
houses will survive and should offer
students an attractive economic al-
ternative in the future.”

The perennial complaint about the

quality of entertainment. Good en-
tertainment necessitates very early

Dance Board must know far in ad-

Or, it must hold money in reserve

BY AL ORGAIN
SBA President

On March 23, elections for law

school representatives to the Execu-
tive Committee, University Council,
and the Law Student Division of the
American Bar Association were con-
ducted in the Washington and Lee
Law School.

The results of these elections are
of course important to the welfare of
the Student Bar Association, but the

result of the referendum included |

on the same ballot is even more im-
portant to the long range future of
the S.B.A. This referendum concern-
ed the collection of SBA dues with
the law school tuition.

A little over a year ago, the
S.B.A. unanimously approved a pro-
posal to make S.B.A. membership
mandatory and dues obligatory (i.e.
an integrated bar). The idea behind
having an integrated bar was to ac-
custom future lawyers to the manda-
tory bar membership which they
would encounter on the outside and
at the same time provide continuity
of income for the S.B.A.

This proposal took effect Septem-
ber 1970 after appropriate indica-
tions had been made in the 1970-71
Law School Catalogue. Dues at the
time were $3.00 per year and were
still being collected by the S.B.A.
treasurer on a “hit or miss basis.”

Two months later the SBA voted
to raise dues to $3.00 per semester,
thus adding to the collection head-
aches of the treasurer.

By initiating the integrated bar,
the S.B.A. had taken an important
step forward, but it had not gone as
far as it could to rid itself of the
mechanical difficulties of raising
revenue.

The SBA membership recognized
the problem when they voted on
March 23. With the largest voter
turn out in my experience in law
school the issue of inchiding SBA
dues with tuition passed with nearly
two thirds of the votes in the affir-
mative. Actual results were 122 in
favor of tuition and dues, 65 against,
and 11 abstentions—an amazing de-
gree of agreement for a group of
future lawyers.

Disregarding the outcome the
mere fact that 88.3% of the law stu-
dents voted is a very good sign.
Maybe we're gaining on that old
enemy—apathy.

Bill Anderson, SBA treasurer, is
currently working out the details of
the dues-with-tuition plan with the
University treasurer, Mr. Whitehead.
Assuming that we encounter no in-
soluble problems at this stage we
should begin operation under this
plan in Septemyber of this year.

But why is this dues collection so
important? The point is that with an
assured, easily collectable income
and hopefully with another more
realistic rais cin dues (our dues are
the lowest of the nine other law
schools in this circuit) the SBA
would be more able to expand its
budgetary activities beyond the soc-
ial scene which now demands the
largest portion of our funds.

One area which could certainly
stand substantial financial backing
is our speaker program. In the past
for the most part we had to rely on
speakers who were friends of the
school and did not charge a fee
Needless to say this arrangement did
not always produce the most inter
esting programs, Getting a big name
wus out of the question except on
those infrequent occasions when
Contact had an appropriate epeaker
here. Another improverished activity
is the Placement Commutiee which
has recently undertaken an expan-
sion of its services

Not all of this money should come
from dues. Now | address myself to
Steve Robinson and the other mem
bers of the EC. The SBA needs to
have a larger allocation of the
money we pay as a student activity
fee already included in tuition, Law
students simply do not get the same
rewrn from the activity fee as the
undergraduates, Don Weir, a recem
candidate for Student Body
dent (and the only one to speak to
the SBA) voiced his concern over
this matter to the SBA and said if
elected he would work to get the law
school a bigger share. It may well
been the law school vote for

Robert Schatz named “best oralist” in Moot Court competition,

W&L Student Wins

Moot Court Contest

Robert B. B. Schatz, a second-year
law student at Washington and Lee,
was named best oralist last week in
regional finals of the Philip C. Jessup
International Law Moot Court Com-
petition.

Judges chose Schatz over other
legal debaters from West Virginia,
North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennes-
see, Indiana, Illinois and the District
of Columbia.

The international law moot court
competition was held at the Univer-
sity of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill. This was the first year a team
from Washington and Lee’s law

school has participated.

Schatz is a 1969 graduate of the
University of Wisconsin, where he
received his bachelor of arts degree
magna cum laude with majors in
English and art history. He won
honors for his undergraduate thesis
in English and was named a Wood
row Wilson fellowship finalist.

At Washington and Lee he is a
member of Phi Delta Phi legal fra
ternity, the Student Bar Association,
the campus Young Republicans or-
ganization and the student body's
committee on recruitment of under-

Class Officers Announced;

Following the final major install-
ment of elections for next year’s stu-
dent body leadership, the EC an-
nounced the results last week of the
coniests for four Exeoutive Com-
mittee positions, two class Officers,
and the seats for the University
Council. Also decided were the Vice-
Presidential races for the Arts, Sci-
ences, and Commerce Schools.

Moon Yee and JoJo Martin led a
field of five to capture the two Sen-
ior EC seats. Archer Frierson topip-
ed incumbent Craig Jones, 90 votes
to 72, in the Junior EC match. The
Sophomore representative will be
Russ Fletcher, who preserved his
seat by a seven-vote margin.

Bo Brookby decisively bested Bert
Meem for the presidency of the Sen-
ior Class. In the runoff for Vice-
President of the Sophomore Class,
Bo Dudley drew 143 ballots to 86
for his opponent Clifton Overcash.
Phe recently-conceived University
ouncil, to be composed of 12 stu-
dents and 12 faculty members, is
scheduled to assume functions this
pring. But, because of a voting
fluke, the full student delegation is
yet to be decided.

There are to be four Seniors,
three Juniors, two Sophomores, and
one Freshman on the Council, and
election to these positions last Mon-
day was by plurality of votes cast.
[he winners from the Senior Class
and their vote tallies were: Don

each receiving 76 votes. Similarly,
Ted Amshoff, Paul Hartmann, Mar-
tin Stein tied, with 66, in the Sopho-
more race, with Lewis Powell receiv-
ing 137 votes to capture the first seat.

The EC, faced with a chance di-
lemma, at first decided to flip a coin
in the Junior and Sophomore dead-
locks, and Robertson and Amshoff
emerged as the winners ‘by lot. But it
was decided that such a method of

determination was unfair, and the
run-offs for these two University
Council positions will be decided on
April 21, after the Spring term com-
mences.

Also revealed last Thursday were
the outcomes of the contests for V.P.

UC Runoff Planned;
EC Defeats Motion
To Curtail Posters

Last evening the EC reversed an
earlier decision and scheduled runoff
elections for Sophomore and Junior
repersentatives to the University
council. Junior Don Weir moved
that the two contested seats be decid-
ed by an election the first Wednes-
day after the Spring Term begins.
This motion passed 10-1 with Sta-
man Ogilvie in opposition.

Originally the EC had decided the
winners by a coin toss. There was a
tie for third place in the Junior class
race and also a tie for second place
in the Sophomore class. The Univer-
sity Council is scheduled to meet to-
morrow, so the BC felt that there
was not sufficient time for a runoff.

THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

March 30, 1971

October 6, 1971?

The independent examinations scheduled for this Decem-
ber were cancelled two days ago by the faculty, in case you
hadn't noticed the headline on the front page.

In a three hour meeting, the faculty resolved that the De-
cember examinations would be conducted under the old system
which was used previous to the 1970-71 school year.

Surprised? We're not. Last year’s minor crisis before winter
term exams contained the kernel of the debate which has flour-
ished over the independent exams ever since.

For the record, the EC at first attempted to codify the
pledge on the exam envelope in order to mollify certain mem-
bers of the faculty who were concerned—and perhaps rightly
so—with the proliferation of comments about the fall exams
in December of 1970.

The EC then reversed its field and arrived at the conclusion
that any pledge other than the one used on all other work at
W&L would be in the form of a “contract.” So the pledge for
the winter exams was the normal one.

But, fortunately, even this attempt at leaving the pledge of
Honor open without a “no comment” rule did not prevent in-
stances of comments during the exam period. The EC was not
happy. Neither was the faculty. And now, after the death of
independent exams, the students aren't very pleased with the
outcome, either.

Last year’s student body president, Fran Lawrence, wrote
the following in this newspaper before the April exams began.

“Probably some comments about examinations do not give
any aid—they would not be a violation of the Honor System.

“This must be decided on an individual basis. We all have
to make a special effort, however, not to give information on
the exam to a student who has not taken the same exam. It
creates a predicament for everyone involved.

“The easiest policy is to keep our mouths completely shut.
Another reason for this is that, although some comments on
examinations may not be Honor Violations, they may cause
the Independent Exam program to be dropped.

“The faculty, understandably, would prefer that no com-
ments whatsoever be made about the finals.

“Keeping silent will work to insure that we keep the ad-
vantage of scheduling our own examinations.”

Well, the freedom of the independent examinations is dead.
And the cries of dismay which followed Monday's action by
the faculty are utterly absurd: the students have only them-
selves to blame. They had best, as Fran Lawrence bluntly put
it, keep their “mouths completely shut.”

If students cannot live up to the responsibilities involved in
an independent exam program, then they have little privilege
to the freedom it provides. Last Monday's formal passing of
the independent exams into oblivion was only an after-thought.
The students themselves killed the idea a long time ago.

Pes

We hope that we'll never have to read an editorial like this
one again.

Bowl? No, it is a scene from an election—W&L style.

It seems that the election yesterday for undergraduate
members of the newly formed University Council almost de-
generated into a game of chance. Here are the facts. Three rep-
resentatives were to be elected to the UC from the upcoming
Junior class. There was a tie for third place; both Greg Robert-
son and Bill Merchant received 76 votes. A similar event oc-
curred in the Sophomore election where Amshoff, Stein, and
Hartmann were dead-locked for the second seat on hat body.

The EC decided for the sake of expediency to omit a run
off election. In its place the winners were to be selected by lot.
The four candidates were summoned by the EC and told to call
“heads or tails.” The candidates did not exactly agree to the
procedure but “they did not object” as one EC member so
eloquently put it,

Last evening at the EC meeting Staman Ogilvie explained
that, “after you watch the polls for 76 elections, you get a little
tired of runoffs. Let the new EC decide who should be on the
University Council.”

Mr. Ogilvie might do well to read the Student Body Con
stitution. No where in that document is coin flipping or for
that matter any form of lottery approved as the proper proce
dure for selecting officers.

But wait, there is a happy ending to this little story
Weir came to the rescue and noted some of the irregularities of

Don

the “election” and asked for a runoff between the candidates
His motion to that effect passed 10-1. So March 21 Mr. Mer
chant will face Mr. Robertson and Mr. Stein will face off with
Mr. Amshoff and Mr. Hartman in an election

So another tradition (coin flipping) bites the dust

Foreign Study Program Begins

One of the most educationally
valuable of a whole array of new
programs begins this month when
23 students and three professors
leave for Europe in the School's first
“study abroad” program of its own.

The foreign study program itself
is not new, not even at Washington
and Lee. Other colleges have had
them for years, and through coopera-
tive arrangements students have al-
ways been able to take advantage of
them.

But the way the university has de-
signed its own program has, in the
eyes of its participants, led to unique
new opportunities, with a degree of
individual flexibility an dcompre-
hensiveness few other programs can
match,

To be sure, plenty of foreign-lang-
uage and European history majors
will be going to France or Germany
or Spain. That isn’t unusual. The
‘basic idea behind study-abroad pro-
grams has always ‘been to give stu-
dents first-hand experience with lan-
guage and culture and history.

But the program doesn’t stop
there. In addition to students from
the fields one would expect, there
will be majors in the sciences, in
commerce, even in American history
and English. A few sophomore par-
ticipants, in fact, haven't even de-
cided on a major yet.

The idea is simple. There is more
—much more—than “just” language
and culture that can be learned bet-
ter On the spot than in a textbook or
lecture.

The participating students’ indivi-
dual projects are as imaginative as

the program, and as diverse as the
students themselves. Where, for in-
stance, is the best place to research
the role of the French played in

Renaissance Study Sets
Varied Lecture A genda

Almost unnoticed among the many
new offerings in this year's catalogue,
Interdepartmental 303 signals a new
departure in teaching methods for
WA&L.

The subject matter of the course is
the Renaissance and the approach
has been determined to a great ex-
tent by the previous studies and the
interests of those registered for the
course.

Each week a talk will be offered,
followed the next day by a group dis-
cussion of the material presented in
the lecture. Then each participant
will choose a phase of the subject
discussed and prepare a paper on it.
A seminar type meeting will be used
later in the week, the papers read
and discussed by all in the course.

Lectures will be given by mem-
bers of five departments of Washing.
ton & Lee and two visitors from
other universities, cach presenting
his or her own views on the specific
subject under discussion.

Among the topics scheduled for
drscussion are the history of the
Renaissance period by Mr. Sanders
of the History Departmen, the re
vival of the interest in man in Re
naissance art by Dr. Doyon of the
Fine Arts Department, and one on
scientific thinking in the Renaissance
by Dr. Turner of the Physics Depar!
ment,

In addition, a talk on protest in
the literature of the Renaissance will
be given by Mrs. Jo Ann Church,
formerly of Fisk University, and one
by Mrs. Anna Otien of Antioch Col
lege dealing with the quest for iden
tity during the Renaissance

The lectures will be given on Mon
days during the Spring Term, ex
cept for one to be given on Tuesday
April 20 by Dr. W. W. Johnson of
the Spanish Department on the urge

toward geographical expansion and
discovery.

All lectures are open to the pub-
lic, and students are invited even
though they may not be taking the
course for credit, Dr. Arthur Scharff
of the Romance Language Depart-
ment is directing the course and
more specific information may be
obtained from him.

It is planned to offer a similar
treatment of the Middle Ages next

year.

So students in the Germany section
of the study-abroad program will
visit there for five days, as one of
their side trips before returning to
the United States.

If a student’s academic interests
lie in identifying and analyzing the
influences that acted upon foreign
‘writers and dramatists, especially
men whose works have had major
impact in America, there is nothing
that can take the place of a first-
hand inquiry, on the scene, And so
students will be “over there,” re-
searching the careers and works of
literary giants such as Samuel Bec-
kett and Bertolt Brecht and E.T.A.
Hoffman and Jean Anouilh.

There are two ways a student in-
terested in international economics,
to take another example, might in-
vestigate socio-economic differences
between European and American
families. He might sit in his library
and read, or he might undertake ori-
ginal research himself. And no mat-
ter how good a library is, it’s second-
best, behind personal, scholarly field
investigation.

Other representative projects which
students will undertake during their
six-week “mini-semester” in Europe
include studies of music, historical
life-styles, sociological patterns, and
research in chemistry, mathematics
and other natural sciences,

to Spain to study contemporary

ish university about the American

With Malice Toward Some

Caps and Gowns

BY JEFFREY B. SPENCE

It appears that Washington and
Lee is going to bid farewell to quite
a number of its seniors this year in
a most unpleasant way.

As a result of a decision by the
Faculty Executive Committee any
student who desires to participate in
the commencement exercises on
June 4 must wear “appropriate aca-
demic garb—"in other words, cap
and gown.

Recently I went to the Dean of
Students to inquire about whether
one might participate in the com-
mencement exercises in a suit and
donate the money for the cap and
gown to the S.W.M.S.F.C. The Dean
pointed out to me that one does not
have to attend the ceremony to “gra-
duate.”

The ceremony, according to the
Dean of Students and the assistant
Dean of the College, is to be attend-
ed on a strictly voluntary basis. The
Dean of Students went as far as to
describe the ceremony as “Mickey
Mouse” so as to allay any distress
I might have over not attending.
There is no penalty for nonatten-
dance, according to the administra-
tion.

No penalty? Well, that és not ex-
wotly true. Hf one of the seniors opts
for the voluntary choice not to at-
tend he is not allowed to receive his
diploma until sometime next Octo-
ber. Is that not a penalty? | think it
is.

Last May a precedent was set
when some 10 to 20 percent of the
graduating seniors attended
the commencement exercises in suits
rather than the traditional cap and

gown. There was no hue and cry
raised as a result then nor has there
been any since then. Why is it not
to be allowed this year?

The answer to this question comes
from Dean Watt who claims that it
would break down the uniformity of
the ceremony.

The stated policy of this school is
its emphasis on the individual per-
son. If this is true then what place
does uniform regimentation such as
Dean Watt describes have at Wash-
ington and Lee? I certainly hope
that uniformity is not what we are
‘being groomed for here.

If the University really means to
live up to its policy of no penalty if
one opis not to attend the gradua-
tion ceremony then it ought to allow
a student to pick up his diploma im-
mediately following it. In fact, I
see no reason whatsoever that a stu-
dent who desires to participate in
the commencement exercise on June
4 should be prevented from doing
SO just because he does not wear a
cap and gown.

| hope that my fellow students
who desire to participate in this up-
coming graduation ceremony but are
without a cap and gown will let
their voices be heard by the Faculty
E.C. and the Administration.

Furthermore, those students who
opt to not attend, for whatever rea-
son, should demand that they receive
their diplomas on the same day as
those who do attend the ceremony.
Washington and Lee must certainly
have room within itself to accomo-
date more than just the wishes of the
Faculty Exeoutive Committee and
its Deans. Think it over. Peace.

‘Base of Lunacy’

BY MARC SMALL

In this age of camp causes and
these many “pressing concerns” that
appear one day, flame for a mere
second, and are forgotten even while
Madison Avenue commervializes
them for the middle class, it is per
haps inevitable that the activists
should slip through increasingly silly
protests until they reach the ultimate
base of lunacy

While I hardly find that they have
accomplished the latter, I do find
the current browhaha over “welfare
rights,” for all its relevaney, so con-
tradictory as to be thoroughly ridi
culous

When a person, whether from nec
essily or from sloth, places himself
on the dole, he sacrifices his prero
gatives as a free agent. For all the
legal safeguards in our political sys
tem, 4 person on welfare has siill
made himself a slave to the system in
its slates quo form, and must-—dor
the of his srvival—play the
role of a staunch Opponent of any
ind all change that will threaten his
continued supply of thal government
money he receives

lt is part of our tradition to find
When the

sake

this Dossiam renuenant

“Cattle Barons” or their more nol
ern ik have run a town, controlling
not only the livlihood but also the
complete social and political life of
a community, we have condemned
this as dictatorship and have passed
laws and statutes controiling it to a
great extent,

It has become axiomatic to our
culture that any of these “factory
towns” must indeed be a tyranny,
and any person running one a ty
rant, even though many of them
have in fact been extremely kind and
benevolent

Bui there is little benevolence in
deed in slavery. We are, as a na
hon, aware of this, and we have
long ago made clear our intention of
sanding on our own own and taking
the responsibilities and obligations
of free men upon ourselves

We have rejected the idea of the
slave, who has no liberty but has in
compensation the security of know

Stickmen Ranked Seventh

BY RAY SWAN

After gaining a ranking of 7th in
the nation the W&L lacrosse team
beat Dartmouth last Wednesday 13-3
to earn a 3-0 record so far this sea-
son.

The Generals dominated the game
from the start, shutting out the In-
dians for three quarters. Bill In-
gersoll and the defense combined
for their best effort so far.

Sam Englehart started the scoring

for the Generals with about eleven

minutes left in the first quarter.
Hank Glausson scored next to give
the Blue a 2-0 lead. Englehart scor-
ed his second goal with five minutes
left, and again with only 41 sec-
onds left. Bob Brumback recorded
a goal twelve seconds later to give
W&L a 5-0 lead at the end of the
first quarter.

The second quarter saw less ac-
tion. Englehart got his fourth goal

Davies Hopes For Tennis Title

Washington and Lee's tennis team
had a very successful year last sea-
son, but apparently that’s not quite
good enough for new head coach
Tom Davies.

The Generals posted a 10-2 won-
lost record, but slipped to a lowly
fourth-place finish in the College
Athletic Conference tournament, an
event they had won the previous
three years.

“Let's just say I definitely expect
this year’s team to contend for the
championship,” commented Davies,
the W&L assistant basketball coach
who has now added the tennis team
to his duties.

Davies has the horses to work
with. The top four players from last
year all return, led by senior team
captain Bill Gatlin, along with no. 2

man Stan Taylor, no. 3 Marshall
Washiburn and no, 4 Jeff Driscoll.

Close behind them are three non-
lettermen—Steve Swenson, Lee Thal-
heimer and Dave Gilbert—and a trio
of top-notch freshmen: Tim Thomp-
son, Greg Barker and Bo Hobson.

Any one of them could move into
the top six places, according to
Coach Davies. And there are sev-
eral more “pretty decent” freshmen
waiting in the wings as well.

The 1971 net Generals face an ex-
panded schedule with several tough
opponents, among them Duke, Vir-
ginia, Virginia Tech and William &
Mary. Also included is a Southern
Spring Trip in which W&L will take
on Duke, Emory University, Rollins
and Florida Presbyterian on succes-
sive days.

of the afternoon midway through
the period. Ted Bauer closed out the
half’s scoring, scoring a goal ‘with
only 48 seconds left. The Blue left
the field at halftime with a 7-0 lead.

It took W&L only 38 seconds to
score in the third quarter. Tim Win-
field recorded a goal to start another
five-goal spree. Captain Whit Morrill
scored one and Englehart scored
two in less than thirty seconds. The
General's lead stood at 12-0 after
Skip Lichtfuss closed out the scor-
ing, getting a goal with only 37 sec-
onds left in the quarter.

In the fourth quarter, co-captain
Scott Neese scored the Generals’
lone goal. Dartmouth scored all
three of its goals in this period. The
Generals were able to substitute free-
ly, and Skeeter Chadwick took over
for Ingersoll in the crease.

Dartmouth’s All-American attack-
man Mike Diaz was held to a single
goal. The Indians seemed to have
trouble with fundamentals, and
could not develop any kind of consis-
tent attack. The Generals continued
their hard body-checking.

The game against East Carolina,
scheduled for last Saturday morning,
was cancelled because of snow. The
Generals do not play at home again
until May 8, against Loyola of Balti-
more. They have a full away sche-
dule until then, however, including
games with Wesleyan, Connecticut,
and Navy during Spring vacation.

dropped the battle with Bridgewater
92-53. On Thursday ACC power
Wake Forest handed its second loss
in three outings.

Times were generally bad and
competition not too keen Tuesday,
both as a result of the time of the
season and condition of the track.
Sharp March winds and sub-50 tem-
peratures made it tough for anyone
to get sufficiently warmed up and
loose, much less anywhere near peak
shape for the season's first meet.
Also, as anyone who has played ten-
nis on the gravel courts under the
“world’s longest foot bridge of its
kind in the world” knows, the track
was in less than great shape—slow,
loose and peppered with those un-
expected mounds.

There were, however, bright spots
and outstanding individual perfor-
mances. Most notable of efforts were
those of sophomore Paul Suthern.
The lanky Connecticut Yankee ran
and jumped for three firsts Tuesday
and tallied another Thursday against
Wake Forest before pulling up lame
with tendon trouble. He took the
high hurdies in a time of 15.4, the
440 intermediate hurdles in 64.9,
and finally won the long jump with a
20 foot, 7 inch leap. Suthern also
took first again in the highs against
Wake Forest but, in so doing, devel-

As expected, the major area of

Students had to arrange with an ap-

receive credit for their overseas
work, too, since after all the pro-
gram is a part of the university's
curriculum, not a holiday.

Students—and the professors who
will ‘be serving as their tutors and
advisors in Europe—also had to
come up with the whole cost of the
term abroad,

But that is only the tip of the ice-
berg. Making arrangements for the

times frustrating task, according to
Prof. David B. Dickens of the uni-
versity’s German department, chair-
man of the foreign study committee
and leader of the German group.

Together with his counterparts in
French and Spanish, Drs, G. Francis
Drake and S. J. Williams, he had to
go to Europe (again at his own ex-
pense) last summer to make living
and teaching arrangements. Students
and faculty will live with individual
German, French and Spanish fami-
lies, giving the program another edu-
cational advantage.

Generally, students in the program
will take regular classes while in
Europe, “borrowing” the facilities of
major universities there. Their own
projects will be reserved for their
free time, in the same way individual
projects are undertaken “back home”
at Washington and Lee.

At the end of their Buropean stay,
each student will be required to sub-
mit a thesis, reporting the results of
his European research. Then he'll re-
ceive six hours of class credit, the
same amount being earned by his
colleagues who remain in Lexington.

The group leaves Monday, April
19. Most of the participants will re-
turn the first week of June, (The
seniors will have to. They graduate
June 4.)

A number, however, will stay in
Europe through the summer—still
another added advantaoge of the
unique Washington and Lee pro-
gram. With the “short term” com-
ing at the end of the academic year
instead of in the middle as it does at
almost every other college, there is
nothing to keep them from remain-
ing to continue their work. Already,
before they have even begun, four
or five have said they plan to stay in
Europe.

The French group will be head-
quartered in Paris, the Spanish in
Madrid, and the German in Bay-
reuth. Bringing a Lexington custom
with them, the grouips will use week-
ends for extensive travelling.

Mahan Awards Offered
(Continued from Page 1)

cipients of the awards receive $100
tuition or $60 cash.

Entries may be submitted in one
or more of four categories: fresh-
man, sophomore, and junior Prose,
and poetry. The total awards in any
one year may not exceed five, and
awards are made only when the en-
tries achieve a level of excellence re-
quired by a committee of judges in
the Department of English.

Further details and instructions
concerning the contest may be ob-
tained in Payne Hall, where the en-
tries ate to be submitted.

grades free men and, for the sake of
a meal, turns them into the paid
lackies of the system.

If we are to have a dole, it should
ibe done in such a way that those in-
volved in it would not become those
most concerned in its retention or
expansion, The Hatch Act prohibts
Civil Servants from involving them-
selves in partisan political activity,
the several “conflict-of-interest” laws
provide that no official may involve
himself in some area of govern-
mental action in which he is private-
ly involved: would it not be reason-
able to likewise prohibit those on the
dole from participating in the poli-
tical arena?

Such an act as this might not only
preserve the political integrity of our
system but might well indeed inypress
upon those concerned he truly ser-
vile nature of their dole.

My “Webster's Seventh New Col-
legiate Dictoonary” gives as any ex-
ample of an oxymoron the phrase
“cruel kindness;” in light of the liber-
ties lost in return for seourity, it is
certainly appropriate to speak of that
oxymoronic blindness, welfare rights,
as the harshest of all “cruel kind-
ness.”

run-off. At any rate our desires and

Wednesday of this week law stu-
dents will once again be asked to
vote on an important issue, We must
decide whether we want one year
terms for SBA officers and a cor-
respondingly more effective SBA or
if we want to remain with semester
officers who are partially paralyzed
by lack of time and incentive. The
choice appears clear—to remain as
we are is unworkable and inefficient.
We are the only law school out of
the nine others in our circuit which
has semester officers.

When I ran for SBA office I stated
that I viewed this semester as a time
for housecleaning. Having already
settled the matter of dues, I think
that a vote for one year terms for
SBA officers would put our house in
good order, and go a long way to-
ward making the SBA a more vib-
rant and effective force-in the Uni-
versity and the community, All I ask
is that you think wbout it and then
vote.

On Committees

By RICK GRAY

One of the integral parts of stu-
dent government at Washington and
Lee is the existence of the various
standing committees. These commit-
tees, in one form or another, oversee
many phases of student life.

The various standing committees
are; Student Control, Student Fi-
nancial Relations, Student Recruit-
ment, Curriculum, Library, and Uni-
versity Center-Orientation,

The Student Control Committee is
responsible for regulating student
conduct in Lexington and the sur-
rounding area, including nearby
girls’ schools. The Student Financial
Relations Committee, formerly the
Cold Check Committee, is respon-
sible for maintaining good relations
between students and local mer-
chants, thus protecting the students’
privilege of writing and negotiating
checks in Lexington.

The Student Financial Relations
Committee does have fining power
to punish those students whose
checks are returned for payment.

The newest of the committees is
concerned with Student Recruitment
and it has been very active this year.
This committee sends representa-
tives to different high schools talk-
ing up Washington and Lee and
answering questions of prospects.

The responsiblities of the Cur-
riculum Committee are the review-
ing of Washington and Lee’s Cur-
riculum and the presentation of
student views on the academic en-
vironment of the University.

The Library Committee is respon-
sible for overseeing student use of
McCormick Library and the dif-
ferent departmental libraries. This
committee does have the power to
fine students who abuse this privi-
lege by damaging or destroying
books.

The University Center-Orientation
Committee has a two-fold purpose,
first, during freshman orientation,
this commitice is responsible for
coordinating the various orientation
activities, and secondly, during the
rest of the school year, it sponsors
social, recreational, and cultural
activities for the university com-
munity, using the University Center
facilities.

Dean Adams Dies;
W&L Mourns Loss

Dr. Lewis Whitaker Adams, dean
of the School of Commerce and
Administration for 20 years, died
April 3 in Lexington following a
long illness.

A graveside funeral service was
conducted in Stonewall Jackson
Cemetery in Lexington Monday,
April 5,

Dr. Adams, who would have been
67 on April 8, joined Washington
and Lee’s faculty in 1926 as assistant
professor of economics.

He earned his bachelor of science
degree in 1925 from the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
then taught economics at Cornell
for a year. His initial stay at Wash-
ington and Lee was short, only three
years; he returned to Cornell for
another year in 1930,

In 1940, he decided that teach-
ing—specifically, teaching at Wash-
ington and Lee—was his first love.
He returned, this time as assistant
professor of economics. Nine years
later, not long after receiving his
doctorate, he became dean—the posi-
tion he was to hold the next two
decades.

“His death brings true sadness,
for he was deeply respected and be-
loved by his many friends here and
by the hundreds of students whose
affection for him was of that special
variety reserved for those who pro-
foundly touched and vitalized their
lives,” said President Robert E. R.
Huntley after Dean Adams’ death.

Under Dr. Adams’ leadership,
Washington and Lee’s commerce
school maintained its membership

Speak

China, where he served until 1940,
His subsequent missions included
service in Hankow, Kunming,
Chungking and Nanking.

He was a member of the inter-
national secretariat at the United
Nations Conference in San Fran-
cisco, and served with Gen. Wede-
meyer's mission to China and Korea
in 1947,

Amb. Sprouse was head of the
State Department's Chinese Affairs
division under President Truman,
before going to embassies in Paris
and Brussels during the 1950s. He
was an envbassy officer in Washing-
ton at the time of his designation
as anvbassador to Cambodia.

He was ambassador to Pnompenh
during the crisis that developed be
tween the two nations over a remark
made by Canrbodia’'s state-controlled
radio at the time of President Ken-
nedy’s assassination, when anrbassa
dors were recalled for a time.

Prince Sihanouk refused to accept
the credentials of Amb. Sprouse’s
successor in 1964, and when Cam-
bodia broke off relations with the
United States in May, 1965, the
embassy was technically without an
accredited anvbassador.

Born in Greenbrier,
1906, Anrvb. Sprouse earned the
bachelor of arts degree in 1928
from Washington and Lee. His alma
mater awarded him the honorary
degree of doctor of laws in 1963

in the extremely selective American
Association of Collegiate Schools of

commerce schools in the country

merce school and to the university
and its students,” remarked Dr.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK: a

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Scholarship Donated
In Memory of Manly

April 21, 1971 Mr.

A major new endowed scholarship ‘by

Dean Lewis Adams

My first personal contact with Lew Adams took place in
1952. | was a young instructor seeking a teaching position,
Lew was a new dean hiring his first teacher. Lew was nervous ;
| was seared,

We established a rapport at that first meeting—a rapport
that continued for almost 20 years. As I think back, [ am
sure that there were a number of times when we did not
agree, but | think that there was never a time when we did
not respect each other (1 hope not).

Lew was one of the few truly dedicated men | have ever
known. There were only two important things in his life—
his family and the Washington and Lee School of Commerce.
He had no hobbies, no outside interests, just complete im-
mersion in family and school. All his thoughts and all his
activities were directed to one or the other of these two
concerns.

Lew wanted Washington and Lee to have the best under-
graduate business school in the country. To achieve this goal
he wanted the best teaching faculty that he could find, the
best possible business major, and a dedicated, proud student
body. I believe that he came close as was possible to the
achievement of these goals prior to his retirement as dean.
The school was, and is, his school in a very real sense.

No one worked as hard at teaching and as dean than Lew
Adams. He was always the first one in the office in the morn-
ing and the last one to leave at night. He was, without doubt,
the most meticulous preparer of lectures, and grader of papers
| have ever known. His textbooks were profusely under-
lined, margins filled with handwritten comments, and jammed
with current material pertinent to the course. He agonized
over each examination paper, and filled the margins with de-
tailed comments. It was not at all unusual for Lew to read
a single paper four and five times when the grade was crucial
to the student being examined.

He was a tough teacher. No one in business finance or
investments completed the course without knowing a great
deal about the subject matter. Despite his demanding classes
he won the lasting respect of those he taught. I have heard
more than one student apologize to him for “letting him down”
by writing an examination that was less than Lew expected,
His sympathy and understanding for students was deep, par-
ticularly for those students who were not doing well. Many
of the endless hours he spent in his office were devoted to
students problems—academic, career, and personal.

During his tenure as dean, Lew hired 15 of the present
17 faculty members now in the school. It was his firm belief
that the most important legacy he could leave future genera-
tions of Washington and Lee students was the best possible
faculty he could find and afford, Almost all of us remember
the experience of visiting the campus to be interviewed for
a teaching job, staying at Lew’s home, being wined and
dined by his charming wife, and discussing the various facets
of undergraduate education and teaching.

It was Lew’s firm belief that you could tell a great deal
about a man at breakfast—particularly if he had had a few
bourbons and had been kept up until three or four o'clock
in hot discussion the evening before. It was a very disconcert-
ing experience, especially since Dean Adams seemed to thrive
on no sleep.

Lew was in the forefront of those members of the American
\ssociation of Collegiate Schools of Business who constantly
pushed for revision of the major requirements, He was justly
proud of our position in this Association. Washington and
lee is the smallest school accredited by the Association,

There is no doubt in my mind that Lew’s single-minded
devotion to his responsibilities as dean weakened his health
He never spared himself when something needed to be done
We will all miss his presence, but we will also keep in mind
the example he set for all of us.

Traveller, Lee’s horse throughout the Civil War, will be buried close
to the general near Lee Chapel this spring.

Traveller’s Re-Burial Set
For Chapel Observance

Traveller, Robert E. Lee's faith-
ful gray horse, will be reinterred on
the campus May 8, near the crypt
where his master lies buried.

Officials of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy will join with the
the University in unveiling and de-
dicating a granite marker at the
gravesite at 3:00 p.m.

The ‘bones of Lee's favorite horse
were dug up from their original
campus gravesite in 1907, and for
many years the skelton was on dis-
play at the Lee Museum in Lee
Chapel. Through the years they de-
ertiorated badly, and when the
Chapel was restored in 1963, they
were removed from display and
placed in storage.

Lee had the Chapel built while
serving as president of Washington
College from 1865 until his death in
1870. During those years, Traveller
was a familiar sight on the college
campus, being ridden by Lee or
grazing on the campus lawn. His

stable adjoining the President's
House remains there today as a
garage.

Lee often spoke and wrote of
his great love for Traveller. The
iron gray horse, with black mane
and tail, was with the General
throughout the Civil War and car-
ried him through many battles.

When Gen. Lee died here in 1870,
Traveler walked in the funeral pro-
cession, his master’s military boots
reversed in his stirrups. He lived for
another two years, dying at age 15

private life

His career as leader of Virginia's
anti-Byrd forces began with his
election as Fairfax County's repre

program has been established at
Washington and Lee in memory of
Basil Manly, a 1906 graduate of
the university and distinguished gov-
ernment economist, corporate ex-
ecutive and author.

The Basil Manly Memorial Schol-
arships will be awarded competi-
tively to entering students at Wash-
ington and Lee on the bases of
personal character, academic prom-
ise, and financial need, university
president Robert E. R. Huntley
said in announcing establishment of
the program.

The newly created program is one
of the most substantial and im-
portant scholarship funds at Wash-
ington and Lee, President Huntley
said.

Prospective Manly Scholars will
visit the university on “scholarship
weekend,” when competition begins
for the institution’s most prestigi-
ous scholarships. The weekend is
held each spring, and a_ highly
select group of outstanding students
who will enter Washington and Lee
as freshmen the following fall visit
the campus for personal interviews
with the financial aid committee.

The first Manly Scholarships will
be awarded to students entering the
university as freshmen this Septem-
ber.

Alienation Of The Military

By MARC SMALL

It is ironic—and indicative of the
irrationality of our age—that the
protest against the Viet-Nam conflict
has centered so thoroughly on the
military, and has, until quite recently,
ignored the civilian authorities who
ordered the military into Viet-Nam.

Unlike Soviet Russia or Hitlerite
Germany, our armed services are
subordinate to the elected civilian
government, and, while military ex-
perts might urge one or another
particular course, they themselves
are hardly responsible for the actions
of popularly-elected executive of
legislative officials.

Yet, the military, as the most
prominent part of the American
involvement in South-East Asia, is
afflicted with a wave of protest
demonstrations, bombings, and sub-
versions.

The end effect of this will be
the eventual alientation of our mili-

 

own expense. Each of us received
a small grant from the University
for this purpose.

It was a fine gesture of support
for and interest in this program on
the part of the administration. There
is no doubt in my mind that this
spring's programs will be successful
and more than justify the “con-
sidered risk” represented by last
summer's grants.

David B. Dickens
Chairman,
Foreign Study Commiltee

Released

Son of a clergyman, Miller grow
up in Rockbridge County and was
educated at home prior to entering
Washington and Lee. Although a
layman, he has consistenly been in-
volved in Christian service orgamza
tions, inchiding the World Counc!
of Churches, which he served as
central commitiee member from
1954 until 1960

In World War I he saw action as
an artilleryman with the First Di
vision in France, and in Workd War
ll he served as colonel on General
Eisenhower's staff at SHABF, and
was decorated by the American,
British, French and Belgian govern
ments

Miller's challenges to Battle and
Byrd the most serious the
organization” experienced until the
1960's. By the end of that decade,
however. of Miller's ideas
considered “radical” when he pro

wefe

maosl

posed them—had been pul into
effect in Virginia. In an editorial in
1969, the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot
termed him “The Political Winner
After All”

Ihe reception for Miller ai the
Hooksiore wil Re held fram 3:10

until Sp.m. The public is invited

tary from its civilian roots; we will
become, like Voltaire’s Prussia, “an
army with a state.” The professional
cadre of the armed forces have
already begun to feel themselves
divorced from the civilian sectors
of the society; to what level will
an extrapolation of this factor over
two or three decades reach?

Will we have a military in which
the great majority of the partici-
pants are career-oriented and have
little or no real interest in the
civilian world around them?

The danger in this is apparent:
it is far more likely for a profes-
sional army with its career officers
to attempt to exert its influence on
the political sphere which encom-
passes it, or if conditions have de-
generated sufficiently, to seize the
very reins of power which now
bridle it. Even if this sort of coup
d'etat were not to take place, it is
stil likely that such a structure
would become an ingrained, self-
perpetuating force in the political
areana, acting in much the way the
Japanese military did under the
Meiji Constitution.

Given our current sentiment and
social atmosphere, “Seven Days in
May” is far more likely with an

alienated, ingrown military than
from a  popularly-supported and
civilian<iominated force.

However great the laws in the

sysiem, they are flaws whose solu-
tion is found in civilian control and
civilian support for the citizen-
soldier heritage of our nation, not
in the social disfranchisement of
the military. This is owr military;
we, as its owners and controllers,

FRANCIS PICKENS MILLER

Manly’s widow, daughter,
and grandsons. Basil Manly was
named a fellow in political science
science at the University of Chicago
after earning his A.B. degree from
Washington and Lee. He was award-
ed the master of arts degree from
Chicago in 1910,

He served as chairman of the Fed-
eral Power Commission for three
years during World War Il, as co-
chairman with William Howard
Taft of the War Labor Board in
the first World War, and drafted
two of the most comprehensive and

important labor reports in this
century.

His four-volume Iron and Steel
Report, issued in 1912, laid the

foundation for abolishing the seven-
day work week and for adopting the
eight-hour day, and is recognized as
the most significant investigation of
a single American industry.

The Child Labor Report, issued
by the U. S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics, with which he was an
expert, and known as the “Manly
Report,” was 11 volumes in length
and, with an edition of 100,000
copies, was the most widely cir-
culated such government document
ever issued.

Following issuance of the two
landmark investigative documents,
Manly served as director of investi-
gation for the U.S. Commission on
Industrial Relations and subsequ-
ently as an economist for the Federal
Power Commission and for the
states of New York and Wisconsin.

In 1931 he drafted a new Corrupt
Practice Act while serving as special
counsel to the U.S. Senate Com-
mittee on Campaign Expenditures,
and in World War Il was named by
President Roosevelt as vice-chair-
man of the National Defense Power
Committee. In 1944 he was appoint-
ed supervising commissioner with
the Natural Gas _ Investigation
agency, and shortly thereafter he
retired from governmental service
to become vice-president and di-
rector of the Southern Natural Gas
Company.

In addition to government work,
Mr. Manly served as economic ad-
visor to the Newspaiper Enterprise
Association and as special cor-
respondent for several newspapers,
inchuding the Brooklyn Eagle, the
New York World and the Newark
Evening News.

His wife, who shared in establish-
ing the new scholarship program at
Washington and Lee in his memory,
is the former Miss Marie Merriman
Bradley. They were married in Lex-
ington Dec. 15, 1912. He died in
Washington, D.C. May 11, 1950.

Mr. Manly was the son of the
Rev. and Mrs. Charles Manly. Rev.
Manly was president of Furman
University from 1881 until 1897,
and subsequently served as pastor of
the Lexington Baptist Ohurch from
1903 until 1914. The Rev. Manly’s
father, Basil Manly, had himself
been a university president (Ala-
bama).

Shortly after his death in 1924,
the congregation of the Lexington
Baptist Church renamed the church
Manly Memorial, in recognition of
the “unusual love and esteem” in
which its members held him.

LaRue’s Press Box

 
 

This is going to be extremely hard
to write, although I really don’t
have to maintain a great degree of
objectivity in this column. I would
just like to take the time to thank
all those who made the ‘baseball
squad's spring trip to Houston the
success that it was. In so doing, I
must cast aside standard journalistic
routine in favor of large measures
of gratititude and emotion and more
than a little filial love.

Thank to the efforts of W. H. La-
Rue, the W&L alumni, and Coach
Joe Lyles, the Generals wined,
dined, and even played six ball
games. Alumni and parents of cur-
rent students housed the players,
for six nights providing them with
breakfast. Extravagant suppers were
concocted by Mr. LaRue; barbecued
chicken, steak teriyaki, spaghetti,
and roast beef were among the fare.
We may not have been the best ball
club in Texas, but we were un-
doubtedly the best fed.

The Generals encountered rather
stiff opposition, however, and must-
ered only one victory in six tries.
But what a game to win! W&L
dropped the first three matches to
Rice, but the Big Blue rallied three
times to conquer the Owls in the
final contest 6-5, coming wp with
three runs in the last inning to
win it.

 

THANKS

Thursday, powerful San Jacinto
Junior College, 35-3 at the time,
notched two more victories by ‘beat-
ing the Generals in a windy double
header.

Folloiwng the twinbill, the W&L
iballplayers and fourteen prospective
freshmen from the Houston area
were hosted by the alumni at a din-
ner given at the San Jacinto Inn.

The trip was successful in three
respects. Beside the fact that it
marked the first time, as far as any-
one knows, that W&L has ever
played in Texas, or defeated a South-
west Conference club, the journey
provided the Generals with a look
at top-notch competition, The team
should benefit from the experience
as it seeks a CAC championship.

Secondly, the trip was a great
move in the field of alumni rela-
tions. The Houston crowd, somewhat
remote from recent happenings at
their alma mater, was genuinely
enthused by our journey, as was
shown by the dinner on the final
night. And thirdly, the gathering
was an excellent opportunity to
acquaint the prospective students
who had already been accepted, with
Washington and Lee. In short, the
trip was not only advantageous to
the ball club but was also a tre-
mendously informative good will

Stickmen Capture A Patr;
Nearly Upset Midshipmen

Washington and Lee’s powerful
Lacrosse Team journeyed to Con-
necticut and Maryland over Spring
vacation, returning to Lexington
with two easy victories and a near
upset of traditionally strong Navy.

The official aspect of the trip
‘began with a game against Wesleyan
University, located in Middletown,
Connecticut. The Generals started
strong, piling up a 6-0 lead after
sophomore Skip Lichtfuss hap open-
ed the scoring after only thirteen
seconds of play.

Wesleyan closed to within 6-2 in
the second quarter, but the first of
All-American Whitney Morrill’s
three goals produced a 7-2 lead and
the Generals went on to a 13-6
victory.

The stickmen next faced the Uni-
versity of Connecticut, which many
felt would be a more severe chal-
lenge than Wesleyan. The Huskies
made this prediction look good by
scoring first before W&L tied it at
1-1 in the first period. Connecticut
seemingly had regained the lead in
the last seconds of the quarter, but
their goal was ruled late.

The “goal” was to be Connecti-
cut’s last. Washington and Lee built
up a 4-1 lead in the second period
and breezed to a 10-1 victory. Sam
Englehart, John Lalley, and Ted
Bauer had two goals each. Other
scores were by Lichtfuss, Morrill,
Chip Tompkins, and Jim McCane.

The highlight game thus far on
the season took place Saturday in
Annapolis when Washington and
Lee faced a Navy squad that had
won part of the National Champion-
ship last year and was ranked third
in the country by two major polls
this season. The Generals themselves
were rated tenth in the coaches’ poll
and seventh by The Baltimore Sun.

A large, crowd, including a hardy
group of W&L backers was on hand
as Navy jumped off to a quick 1-0
lead after only seconds of play.

Englehart quickly tied the score
and the teams exchanged goals

throughout much of the first half.
Three times the Midshipmen grab-
‘bed one goal leads, but Hank Slau-
son, Jim Farrar, and Morrill came
back to get the Generals even.

Lichtfuss’ second quarter goal
‘broke the pattern and gave W&L its
first lead at 5-4, and, after Navy
tied it, Morrill’s second score pro-
duced a 6-5 edge for the Generals
at halftime.

The first goal of the second half
belonged to Navy and produced yet
another deadlock, but tallies by
Bauer and McCane, still in the third
quarter, gave Washington and Lee
an 8-6 lead. Poised Navy battled
‘back, however, and drew even by the
end of the period.

Navy’s two goals were the only
scores of the fourth quarter and
handed the Generals their first loss
of the season, 10-8.

have the obligation of giving it not
only that measure of givilian con-
trol necessary in a republican gov-
ernment, but also that support and
well-wishing vital to preserve the
morale and loyalty of its members.
Our Congressional leaders have
authorized the military involvement
in Viet-Nam and then, in a political
about-face, have ‘busily criticized
it. Our media have vented their bile
constantly on the military for obey-
ing the orders of their civilian
leaders. Our college students have
directly rejected the efforts of their
brothers and neighbors in fulfilling
an obligation to their native land.
Is it any wonder that the military
is embittered? Is it any wonder that
the military no longer feels itself
the recipient of public trust?
However great the faults of the
military, it is our duty to correct
them—but not to despise a military
structure which is no more than the
reflection of that society it defends.

Baseball Squad Defeats Rice on Texas Trip

(Continued from page 3)

while San Jacinto Junior College, a
national power loaded with pro
prospects triumphed twice in lop-
sided encounters.

Rice took the opening game of
the trip 3-2 scoring all the runs in
the second inning. The Owls follow-
ed this with a 11-2 win, with hits
by Robert LaRue and Ellie Gutshall
and a walk to David Traylor helping
to produce the W&L scores.

Washington and Lee dropped a
third decision to the Southwest Con-

ference club by a 4-2 count. A walk
to Gutshall, a double by Grayson
Fitzhugh, and hits by Fred Paone,
Jerry Johnson, and Jim Nolan made
up the W&L rally.

The lone victory of the trip was
a 6-5 win over the Owls with the
Generals storming from behind for
three runs in the seventh in an out-
burst keyed by hits from FitzHugh
and Doug Clelan.

The strong Jacinto team crushed
the Generals by scores of 10-2 and
7-0. W&L managed only three hits
in the second game.

‘His’ Students Respected Adams

(Continued from Page 1)

Charles F. Phillips Jr., who was
persuaded to come to Washington
and Lee in 1959 by Dean Adams,
“were perhaps most strikingly re-
flected in the hours he kept. He came
to work early, and stayed almost
through the night.”

A key to Dean Adams’ educa-
tional philosophy was the paramount
value he saw in a broad, humane
education. Firmly he chose to direct
his students away from over-specili-
zation; majors were, and are, offered
in “core” subjects, such as com-
merce, accounting, administration
and economics rather than in narrow
and extremely technical sub-fields.

Dr. Adams often remarked that
he cherished Washington and Lee’s
reputation as a teaching institution,
and he himself continued to teach
every semester in addition to his
administrative duties.

His reputation in business circles
and among graduate schools was
such—and that of the Commerce
School under his direction—that his

men prized a recommendation from
Dean Adams second only to the
Washington and Lee diploma itself.

One of Dean Adams’ significant
legacies—there are too many to
list— is the quality of the faculty
he recruited to the School of Com-
merce. Not only are they outstand-
ing teachers of young men, his first
requirement; they are scholars of
national eminence in their profes-
sions.

Between 1949 and 1969, students
changed in countless respects. But
from the first whose diploma he
signed to the last, there was at least
one enduring characteristic: they
were “his” men, every one of them,
and they loved him deeply for it.

On Glee Club

BY PAUL WEEKS

| would first like to thank The
Ring-tum Phi for this opportunity
to write about the Washington and
Lee University Glee Club, mention-
ing services it performs and some of
the upcoming events concerning the
Club. The Glee Club is under the
direction of Mr. James T. Cook,
himself a W&L graduate, and con-
sists of a well balanced chorus of
about 30 men.

The Glee Club participates in a
variety of musical events both on
and off campus. For instance they
sang at the R. E. Lee Centennial
Commemoration service last Octo-
ber. Concerts have been held both
with the Mary Baldwin College
Choir and the Sweetbriar Choir. Off-
canypus, the Club has appeared at
local Churches for Sunday services,

If you happen to be in the vicinity
of the Student Center on a Monday
or Thursday from 7 - 8:30 p.m. you
will hear them practicing for the
four musical events coming up next
month.

In early May, the Glee Club, to-
gether with the Brass Choir and
members of the Troubadour, will
conduct a workshop at two neigh-
boring high schools. These are pilot
projects for a more extensive pro-
gram scheduled for the Spring of *72.
The program will operate under a
state grant. The object of these
workshops is to instruct and perform
for secondary schools, eventually
throughout the State.

A series of seminars concerned
with words and mywsic will be featur-
ed during the week of May 17.
These seminars sponsored by the
Glasgow Endowment will be con-
duct by Pulitzer Prize composer
Charles Wuorinin and the novelist
Reynolds Price who will be artists-
in-residence for that week, There
will be a concert on May 20 in
which the Glee Chub will assist. This
will be a program of student works
and works developed out of the
week's seminars,

The Chib's final performance of
the year will be a concert on May
27 featuring the Glee Club by it
self, Much work has been put into
this concert’s preparation. They have
added many new selections to their
repertory, Featured among these
new selections will be three Simon
and Garfunkel songs; a series of
short songs by William Latham bas
ed on sixth Century Latin poems
under the title “Song for a day Rome
was not built in” and “Nigra Sum”
by Pablo Selections from
“Hair” and songs by Cari Orff and
Schubert will also be included on
the program

Work will begin early next
and tryouts will be held as soon as
school opens for the incoming fresh
men and interested upperclassmen
A winter concert with Sullins is an
hcipated as well as a performance of
a major contemporary work with
Wilson College

All the year's effort will be
towards the concert tour which the
Chib is planning for the April 72
Spring Break. The target is a tour to
Puerto Rico. Contacts have

Independent Exams Approved
By University Council Vote

Fhe joint student-faculty Univer-
sity Council met for nearly three
hours Saturday morning to discuss
mainly two topics: the status of the
Independent Examination procedure,
and the issue of academic credit for
ROTC, The body passed a resolu-
tion calling for the continuation of
the independent exam system, but
took no official action on the ROTC
question.

Fhe meeting began with the pres-
entation of an argument against the
independent exam system by Mr.
John Gunn. “For most students the
examination period is the time of
their most intense study,” he said.
“The kind of learning acquired dur-
ing exams is not possible earlier [in
the term]; it is very different in
quality from his day-to-day prepara-
tion,”

Gunn continued, “The final exam
gives the student a chance to see it
ail in the perspective of complete
learning, leading up to an accumula-
tive whole. This can be a creative
learning exercise the student
needs an impartial, external review
of his work.”

EC Gets Annual Reports

Ihe Executive Committee receiv-
ed reports Monday night from sev-
eral of the standing subcommittees
on their past year's accomplishments
and future plans. Summaries were
offered by Henry Harkey of the Pin-
ancial Relations Committee, Roger
Munsick of the Curriculum Commit-
tee, and Mike McCall of the Stu
dent Planning and Development
Commitiee. The EC also heard from
Skip Nottberg on his recommenda-
tions for the future of the Dance
Board.

Harkey announced to the Com
mittee that $600 had been paid to
cover bounced checks since Febru
ary and that the year's total will

reach $2300 to cover student finan-
cial error, The signs which the Fin-
ancial Relations Committee install-
ed earlier in local businesses, warn-
ing students to check their bank bal-
ance before writing a check, worked
only for a brief period. Harkey said
he was discouraged with educational
programs and fines, and he outlined
a procedure to take cold check of-
fenders more severely to task.
Harkey suggested retaining the
present (up to $5) fine for first of
fenders, With regard to those up for
a second offense, who form the bulk
of this year’s increased negligence,
he recommended that the committee
be permitted the option of putting

It would follow that third offend-
ers could have their accounts closed

problem be made, this being the de-
termination of the bank concerned.
After considerable discussion on the
matter of out-of-town banks and the
issue §=Of merchant “blacklists,”
Fran Lawrence said that the Finan-
cial Relations Committee ought to
be allowed to establish a “credit re
liability” list at their own discretion,
which would expose the names of
those students who possessed a “bad
financial track record.” This way, it
was pointed out, the stigma of dam
aging a student's future credit rating
could be avoided.

Munsick reported for the Curri
culum Committee that a compilation
of the Teacher Evaluation Survey
was being retarded by a failure of
more than half of those questioned
to respond. He suggested that if
those who have not yet replied could
be urged to do so soon the survey

Phe Economics professor went on
to conclude that “the student should
know as litthe about the examina-
tion’s content before hand as pos-
sible. That means there must be no
comment whatever.” Gunn cited a
case in which a student confessed to
him last term that he had not both-
ered to study for a final because he
had heard that it was not difficult,

“Final examinations under the
conditions we have just finished are
unsatisfactory.” Gunn added that
value judgments are a natural im-
pulse on the part of a student, and
therefore he resolved that their pre-
clusion constituted an “unreasonable
demand on the students.”

Dr. John DeVogt countered this
argument by saying that there really
exists no alternative to the independ-
ent exam procedure under the pre-
sent schedule. Dean Atwood of the
Commerce School pointed out that
several plans had been devised under
a slightly altered schedule which
would allow sufficient time for a
fixed exam system; it was remarked,
however, that under such circum-
Stances all students would have to
twke two exams on at least one of
the days during the period.

Dr. Edward Pinney defended the
new exam system: “I think no one
expected, when we instituted this
system, that we would have absolute
security. With regard to its relative
seourity, | think it has worked very
well, if not distinction.”

Presiding chainman Fran Law-
rence pointed out that in one respect
the independent exams were a strain
on the Honor System, “but on the
other hand it strengthens it” by mak-
ing students more careful and more
aware of their behavior,

“There's no question that the in-
dependent exams are helpful,” re.
marked Steve Robinson. “It allows
students to study according to
the difficulty of their course.” Bob
Carrere lauded the new Operation as

 

“tailoring exams to students own
study habits.”

Gunn protested that Lawrence and
the EC had given their assurances
to the faculty at the time the plan
was accepted that students would
not jeopardize the system by mak-
ing comments about the tests. The
Council finally recommended 21-0
(with four abstentions) that the fac-
ulty approve the Independent Exam
procedure for next year.

In other business, the following
questions were submitted for Coun-
oil consideration: “Is military train-
ing inconsistent with academic edu-
cation?” and “is it in conflict with
academic values?”

Chemistry professor Imeson sug-
gested that it was, indeed, in the
public interest “to provide a civilian
attitude in the lower echelons of the
armed services,”

Dean Atwood, who heads the ad-
visory committee for the Military
Science unit, pointed out that the
university is under contract to pro-
vide some credit for ROTC courses,
and that, even if this were amended,
“the unit would probably disappear
in a few years.” He added that the
unit's presence on campus was also
“a good insurance program for our
own selfish reasons of operation” in
the case that college draft defer-
ments should ever be abolished.

Dr. H. Robert Huntley questioned
whether ROTC staff members re-
ceive the same scrutiny upon hiring
as other members of the faculty, and
he urged that all courses be open to
iMterested students, whether inside
or outside the ROTC program.

The University Council will again
meet in the EC room of the Student
Center Saturday morning. Among
topics to be discussed are the aquisi-
tion of the university's proxy on
stock for summer meetings and

lobbying efforts, the possibility of
#bolishing the grade F, and the pol-
icy of sending grades home to par-
ents,

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
April 28, 1971

From An Ever Writer
To A Sometimes Reader

“One of the most alluring temptations for any human in-
stitution is for it to consider itself as the Ptolemaic (e.g.)
center of a social universe. And this temptation has always
been doubly attractive for The Ring-tum Phi, for its editor and
staff have the somewhat titanic responsibility of accumulating
all the weekly news and opinion of Washington and Lee and
aranging its content on six sheets of newsprint 14 inches wide
and 20 inches long.”

We find it hard to believe that we wrote that windy rhetoric
April 29, 1970. A year has gone all-too-quickly past us
And now we have a new editor-in-

on
since our first newspaper,
chief for this glorious rag.

From this day forth this newspaper will be in the extremely
capable hands of John Robinson, although we'll still be using
these columns for editorial comment now and then. But our
job is, for the most part, at an end.

We would like to think that we've succeeded at our job
because we were read. But John Robinson's thoughts for the
coming year indicate that he’s done some careful appraisal of
the position of editor-in-chief and the effectiveness of this
newspaper. We eagerly await his efforts to succeed in areas ot
this newspaper's operation which need improvement.

To be editor of a six page weekly paper was a challenge for
us—and a joy. Few students have the fortune to realize the
absurd excitement in watching three metal forms fill up with
type, or in eating a ham and cheese a la Co-op for breakfast at
300 in the afternoon. For us, this 70th year of The Ring-tum
Phi was creation and communication. We couldn't have done it

had we not loved every minute of it.

And we couldn't have done it without the help of a manag-
ing editor named Roger Munsick. He lived in the office this
vear. And he'll be back next year as John Robinson's managing
editor. Without his hard work and sheer personality, The
Ring-tum Phi would have been much less for us than it was.

So we turn over the editorship of this newspaper with great
confidence, heartfelt gratitude, and no small degree of sadness.

A Word On Things To Come

With the election of a new editor-in-chief of the Ring-tum
Phi should come an inkling of things to come, With your in-
dulgence I will give you that inkling of information.

The Ring-tum Phi is Washington and Lee University’s
newspaper. A trite statement? I think not. The Ring-tum Phi
should satisfy its role. The paper must not only answer ques-
tions as to what has happened, will happen or is happening, but
more importantly the paper must tell what should happen. In
other words the paper should and will take a position on per-
tinent issues.

As editor-in-chief 1 seek the advice and opinions of all the
members of the Washington and Lee community. I am open
to suggestions and recommendations, so if you have any, feel
free to discuss them with me. However, one word of admonish-
ment—lI will listen to advice but will not bend to the whims of
my advisors.

When I was considering the job of editor-in-chief, I asked
the editor in residence, at Wake Forest, Bill Meliwain (a
former editor of Newsday) what my job would be as editor.
He said “You ought to try telling the boys at W&L something
that will make their life in Lexington a little easier. That can
he accomplished by giving them information they need, enter
taining them or giving them your opinions. But remember you
are editor-in-chief for their benefit, not your own benefit.
lhat's important so I warn you again remember it.”

1 could not have said it better so 1 will not try.

Burton Analyzes Rubin, Rally

BY DOUG BURTON

“We're really strong and we're
really beautiful and we're going to
win. We're going to take over the
state of Vermont; we're going to
take over the state of New Mexico;
we're going to take over the state of
Colorado, and we're going to win all
the elections—that’s what’s going to
happen—we're going to win all the
elections because we've got all the
youth on our side.

“You think that many of the teen-
agers are still backing the conserva-
tives . .. ; well, it's mighty small.
You may think It’s large—but it is
mighty mighty small and they are
really on the defensive, and you can
see them standing together in the
back; they are going to defend rac-
ism and they are going to defend
the Pentagon, and they are going to
defend the war against the Vietna-
mese; in every society like ours
which is so Nazi, there is always
going to be some young people who
continue the values of Nazism!” So
said Jerry Rubin last Friday night at
WAL.

He was one of the Eight, the war
lord at Charlottesville last May.
Newsweek loved him; the networks
crowden him with St. Elmo’s fire.
lo many he had typified the violence
and hilarity of the sixties; to us he
had conjured up visions of all that
was rotten and exciting in America.

Even with that in mind it was not
unpredictable that when his twice
cancelled flight finally did touch
down that Jerry Rubin, the kid who
had wanted to play second base for
the Cincinnati Reds, had landed
smack into the Wasps’s nest.

For weeks it had been billed as
the Shenandoah Festival for Peace
and Justice. Its organizers, Jeff Gin-
gold and the Bakery Free Library
drew wpon a proven formula: heavy
rock bands and three New Left sup-
erstars: Leonard Weinglass, Jerry
Rubin and Dave Dellinger. The
strategy called for Wilson Field to
be a brief staging ground for
throngs of demonstrators en route
to D.C. from points west and south.
Had it succeeded the Bakery would
have bested the celebrated Contact
program for a mere $500.00.

But things were wrong; Dellinger
cancelled suddenly and without ex-
planation; Weinglass couldn't leave
a court case in Pennsylvania. These
setbacks were followed by Rubin's
mismanaged plane reservations
which delayed his appearance until
12:30 a.m.

By that time the initial crowd of
perhaps 1000 had dwindled to 350.
This face of itself was perhaps the
biggest surprise to the organizers
who had anticipated a bare mini-
mum of 2000 persons.

Ironically, many of those who left

BY MARC SMALL

| have been receiving a fair
amount of feed-back over the past
several months from readers who
have commented that I am too con-
cerned with political philosophizing
and fail to offer a series of pragma-
tic programs. This article will be an
attempt to rectify this fault by pre
senting a few ideas for political ac
tion on the conservative side

REDUCED FEDERAL TAXA-
TION: instead of a federal revenue
sharing plan, it seems far more
sensible to merely out federal taxa
tion, and allow the stages to decide
individually whether or not they
want to increase their own taxation
to compensate. This would save a
tremendous amount of book-keep
ing as well as increasing the state
voice in fiscal affairs

PRAGMATISM IN FOREIGN
AFFAIRS: instead of attempting to
base our diplomacy upon some im
perfectly conceived moral base, it is
more practical to establish friendly
relations with all and any nations
no matter what their internal policies

who demonstrate a like good-will
towards this nation, We are not the
moral guardians of the universe, and
it is extremely conceited as well as
hypocritical of us to pass unwarrani
ed judgment on our fellow-nations

INCREASED FISCAL RESPON.-
SIBILITY: there is an extremely ur
gent need for immediate “restructur
ing” of our financial affairs. In place
of the free and friendly policies that
have seen federal money
private

sponsoring
supporting farmers
who raise nothing, and being wasted
by and large on a panoply of boon
doggies and cost over-runs

cades of spendthrift wuste

armies,

four de
if We ate
to cape even more serious CoOrm

quences We must restore some mens

ure of control to the federal bude:

early did so to prepare for the long
trip to Washington the next day.

Many who stayed — townspeople
from Lexington, Buena Vista and
the surrounding area, Buckleyites,

Young Republicans, and Sigma Chi
et al—hardly contributed to the
revolutionary fervor.

This is not to say that “straights”
outnumbered “heads.” The move-
ment was there too; demonstrators
came from as far away as Florida
and New York.

At Jerry’s side stood the frizzy
haired, newly elected sheriff of Ber-
keley, Calif., Stewart Alpert. Sheriff
Alpert is—if possible—a shade gid-
dier than Rubin. He promised to fire
any Berkeley cop who couldn't tell
Yippies where to buy “dope.”

Rubin himself managed to de-
flower every American icon in sight.
A sampling of general targets in-
cluded the following:

 

SOLUTIONS:

“We don’t know what's going to
happen after the revolution. Right
now we have a great potentiality.
We'll decide afterwards what to do
with the potentiality. It's the whole
thing all over: you gotta know where
you're going before you go. I don’t
know what it’s going to be like. We
have to take our chances. But it is
going to be a lot like the spirit in
China, the spirit in North Viet Nam
and the spirit in Cuba.”

THE ARMY:

“I talked to a black soldier on the
plane who told me, “We're stoned all
the time; we don’t go out to the
front lines; we stay back and smoke
grass. Who wants to go out and
fight?” The US has lost her army to
dope and common sense . . . Since it
lost its army, it’s turning to bombs
and technology. The US has lost the
war in Viet Nam, but the US cannot

admit that it has lost a war to people
who don’t even speak English.”
CALLEY:

“Manson allegedly, killed six
white people, allegedly—t still don’t
(believe it and he’s going to the elec-
tric chair, Calley kills 200 brown-
people and he’s sipping martinis at
home with his wife and making trips
to the White House. That’s racism,
pure and simple racism [boos|.”

When Rubin left at 2:00 a.m. after
a tense, insult spattered question
period, the round of applause was
pathetically weak. Reactions to him
were varied although all had been
somewhat awed by his timing,
humor and vitality. No burned out
speed freak this. Still a thread of re-
sentment lingered among many.” He
put on a good show for a “political
moron,” ran a typical comment.

Jerry left smiling.

Letters To The Editor...

lo the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

What Jerry Rubin had to say was
rather strong, but his goals are a
very beautiful thing; it’s just that he
impresses most people as somewhat
of a maniac.

His main problem is in the labels
he uses for things. For instance, he
uses the word “communism” quite a
bit. He ignores the extremely bad
connotations it carries in this coun-

try. We must remember that he said
the Russians have done to commun-
ism what the Roman Catholic
church did to Ohristianity, i.¢., over-
institutionalized it and used it to their
own ends, meaning here the people
in control of each organization.

For instance, the infallibility of
the Pope is very much like the lack
of questioning of a “party” decision
in the USSR. The social body be-
comes one which follows orders
from above, and those giving the
orders are basically concerned with
selfish ends, mostly making them-
selves very materially seoure. An-
other victim of this philosophy is
Lt. Calley.

The true goals of communism are
actually what philosophers have
been writing about for thousands of
years; the popular term I would use
is Utopia. It is the sooiety in which
everyone thinks in just those terms

the society. Not themselves, It is
the same thing as the “greatest good
for he greatest number.”

I can only hope that when my
generation goes to the ballot box,
which is our most sensible and legal
recourse, that we will think in terms
of something larger than just over-
selves. For instance, don't vote
rgainst someone who favors a guar-
anteed annual income. The only
philosophy behind dislike of that
legislation can be one of “If I have
to work for mine, he should have to
work for his.” This is basically very
selfish

It is silly (and tragic) enough that
with this truly global village created
by the electronic media, in which
the entire earth is one community,
that we should divide ourselves into
nations, and the United States goes
even farther: we are divided into
S0 smaller entities which are basic-
ily useless and very ineffecient

Marxist idea of the withering away
of the state. In a technical (and thus
useless when one is thinking in true

there is no government, But if it is
done right—and we have to try

hen no government is necessary, be

cause everyone is thinking about

bout himself and how to manipu
late the sooty to his greatest ma

To grasp this from Mr, Rubin's

many long hours of thinking in a

way you probably weren't taught to
think, fo is basic tenet 6 thal your

included.

For the convenience of those who
wouldn't reach the conclusions on
their own, Karl Marx wrote several
works, Don't think that I worship
him or anything, but he does have a
way of putting things into words
which is pretty good. Try reading
some of that filthy commie propo-
ganda that he wrote; he was preach-
ing Utopia as an end product.

Mr. Rabin wants everyone to
wake up to the possibility of such a
society for the human race and to
start working for it. He wants every-
one to go to Washington, D.C., on
‘May Day and stay there until it
happens. | wish we could all do that,
for what he has in mind as a result
would probably appeal to most peo-
ple as a suitable alternative to the
society we now have.

Unfortunately, doing this would
require “copping out” (excuse the
cliche) of the lives most of us are
now involved in, Personally, | feel
obligated to stay here in school be
cause my parents and the University
are paying for it—not me, Most of
us have instilled in us a set of goals
which run something like “Make
something of yourself,” which means
to get in the rat race and make a lot
of money.

This is the attitude which must be
overcome: everyone must be con
vinced that personal wealth is very
seHish as an end goal, and that if it
keeps going the way it is now, we
will destroy ourselves, either through
atomic warfare or pollution. If you
can understand the fact that the
world will go on without you-—«who
ever you are—~you can begin to real
ize just how unimportant you are to
this world.

Accepting this fact is something
that is hard to do, because it re

Question. “What would be the
first thing you would do with the in-
field area of Washington and Lee’s
Smith Field?”

Answer. “Skin it and resod the
whole thing.”

Such was the exchange in. the
W&L dugout between one of last
Thursday’s umpires and a W&L
player. The venerated man in blue
went further to say that he would
apply the same process to the out-
field, stripping the playing areas of
their cow pastures and replacing it
with real grass.

One need only observe either or
both of the Generals’ two games last
week to watch some crazy bounces.
Of course, when you lose 11-7 ‘to
Hampden-Sydney and 15-6 to Vir-
ginia it certainly isn’t bad hops
you're getting, but last week made
for a couple of exciting dodge ball
matches.

The thing that made the contests
interesting, for a few innings at
least, was the fact that the other
team had to play on that same casta-
strophic surface, which meant that
when a General put wood on the
ball, chances were better than aver-
age that he would get on base.

For a while, W&L had the enemy
on the ropes. Take the
game as an example. The Wahoos
jumped off to a four run lead in the
first inning, sandwiching five hits and
a couple of errors. Not to be left
for dead, the Big Blue came back
with two runs of their own on Dave
lraylor’s second home run of the
season, which, incidentally, gaye him
half the team total. :

The carefree Cavalier bench de-

eriorated into a worried bunch when

the Generals continued the uprising
in the second inning by adding three
runs after holding the enemy score-
less.

What you should know about diamonds
when you know it's for keeps

 

You've dreamed about your
diamond engagement ring a thou-
sand times. But now that you
know it’s for keeps, it’s time to
stop dreaming and start learning
about diamonds and their value.

Because no two diamonds
are exactly alike, jewelers have
adopted exacting standards to de-
termine the relative value of each
and every diamond in the world.
These standards include a dia-
mond's size (carat weight), color,
cut and clar:

 

COLOR: Fine white diamonds are
quite rare and valued accordingly.
Other shades in relative order of

their worth are: blue,

brown and black.

CUT: The cut of a diamond—the
facets placed on it by a trained
cutter—brings out the gem's fire
and brilliance. Anything less than
correct cut reduces beauty, bril-
liance and value

CLARITY: Determined by the ab-
sence of small impurities. A per-
fect diamond has no impurities
when examined under ten power
magnification by a trained eye

CARAT: A _ diamond's size is
measured in carats, As a diamond
increases in size, its price will
increase even more if the quality
remains constant. But larger dia
monds of inferior quality may ac
tually be worth less than smaller,
perfect diamonds

white hats, so to speak. They are at
best a rather dark grey.

The first step is to accept the ab-
surdity of the war in Vietnam and to
get out. The time for noble inten-
tions, if they ever existed, is now
past. We are losing lives for no pur-
pose other than protecting our own
interests, mostly financial.

Since I, like most of us, feel too
tied down to school to go, to May
Day “for the duration,” I am going
to be content to write and hopefully
phone my congressman and sena-
tors. | hope you will, too. Six cents
and fifteen minutes isn’t too much to
ask of anyone, even a very busy col-
lege student.

Tell him what you think, whatever
it is; I'm sure it isn’t the same thing
I'll be telling mine, but after all, he’s
YOUR representative in this govern-
ment; he’s the man you send to Con-
gress to get the most out of it he
can for his own district, thus ‘hope-
fully assuring his re-election. I’m
telling my congressman to stop think-
ing about his re-election and grab-
bing everything he can for my
“home” district. I'm telling him to
start thinking about this whole coun-
try and this whole world, not just a
small part of it. | want him to realize
that political borders are useless to-
day.

We must learn to think about
what could be, not just what is and
how to get the most out of it for
ourselves. And we've got to work for
it. If we don’t, then the chances of it
ever coming about are reduced from
one in millions to zero, As the saying
goes, | wouldn't bet money on it,
either way. But we have to try or
die.

When the panic button goes off or
the clouds never go away and the
sun can't get through any more,
we're all going to die together: hip-
pies, pigs, commies, gooks, ginks,
and of course, “the silent majority.”
If you can’t think of it in any other
terms, think about yourself dying,
along with the of course relatively
insignificant billions of other people
on this planet.

Death is very permanent. Well,
that’s where this country and this

world are headed much too quickly.
As a matter of fact, our government
and the USSR’s both are so mili-
tarily efficient that we can kill each
other off 30 times! What Rubin was
saying was that we can be just as ef-
ficient in education, in farming, in
everything with LIFE rather than
killing as an end,

That's what this whole “revolu-
tionary” movement is about: stop
technology’s movement toward de-
struction and turn it toward the good
of all mankind. We must if we are to
survive,

And get this: when we win—and
we will, sooner or later—you won't
ever have to worry about “the com-
petition.” There won't be any. Every
one of us will be tops in our own
field, because we are all different and
will all have but one thing in com-
mon: realizing that we are all one
big community and working to make
it as good as possible for every one
of us. Heaven after all, is only what

we make of earth. It just takes work.

was granted with the stipulation that

McCall also presented a plan call-
ing for a $20 subsidy per student be
added to the Student Activities Fund
to finance the Dance Board concerts.
He suggested the remainder of the
money could be raised by tickets for
dates at the door.

Tompkins and Thompson concurr-
ed that this idea was totally infeas-
ible. that Dance Board funds simply
could not be extracted on a manda-
tory basis. Skip Nottberg, this year’s
Dance Board chairman, said that he
thought it just as well that the Dance
Board be made to raise its own
funds. “We will probably work a
littlhe harder and the Dance Board
President will probably fell himself
more accountable to the students, if
‘we retain the system of selling dance
plans.”

Burks Court Final Highlights
W&L Law Weekend Plans

What will happen when a nation-
ally known real estate developer
sues a pharmaceutical company and
a chemical corporation for polluting
a 20-acre lake in the middle of his
residential district? Add to this the
fact that the polluting agent, being
dumped in the tributary Moory
River, is the basic ingredient for a
male contraceptive injection, known
as Exaspirin, and one has the mak-
ings of a very engaging controversy.

Despite these humorous overtones,
however, this legal dilemma will be-
come the focus of some very serious
and sophisticated courtroom argu-
ment this Friday in the finals of the
Burks Moot Court Competition. The
case involving environmental pro-
iection will be heard by three jus-
tices of the Virginia Supreme Court
of Appeals, the initial event in a

The topic of his address will be
“Trial by Jury and More Speedy

The finals of the Burks Moot

mination of a year's work for the
Law School freshmen. The final
round of the competition began with

calendar will be done much as ii has
been in the past. The Executive
Committee will work out the mech-
anics. The University Council will
accept or reject or amend the pro
posals. The council can get as involv
ed as it wants to in the inner work-
ings of establishing a calendar. The
faculty basically has delegated some
of its authority in this matter to the
University Council.”

Also in Monday's meeting the
faculty adopted a resohition express
ing its sorrow on the death of Di

Council

The University Council has adopt-
ed a statement on the Independent
‘Exam Schedule and approved a pol-
icy statement on drugs. In other ac-
tion Saturday morning the council
elected Student Body President Steve
Robinson and University President
R.E.R. Huntley as co-chairmen of
the council.

After a closed session the council
studied a proposed Student Affairs
Committee policy statement on
drugs. The SAC was seeking the
council's opinion on the drug situa-
tion.

Professor Thomas Imeson  sug-
gested re-writing of the policy state-
ment to “create better avenues of
communication.” He expressed the
view that this improvement of com-
munications could be accomplished
by assuring students that they would
ibe subject to no reprisals for ad-
mitting their problems to the admini-
stration,

After minor changes in the policy
statement, it was approved unani-
mously. Representatives on the coun-
cil from the SAC asked that the do-
cument be printed in the Student
Handbook and also be mailed to all
students.

The text of the SAC Policy state-
ment on drugs read in part:

“Washington and Lee University
wants to help the individual achieve
a realistic understanding of the con-
sequences of drug use and the abil-
ity to make informed, responsible
decisions. The University’s prime re-
sponsibilities concerning drugs are
education and counseling. Consis-
tent with these responsibilities, the
University wishes to create an en-
vironment in which students may
discuss drug problems openly and
without fear of reprisal. The Uni-
versity, to foster this environment.
will sponsor regular seminars on
drugs and drug use as well as offer
counseling assistance at all times.
In addition, McCormick Library
and the University Center will main-
tain special collections of literature
on drugs.

“Students sincerely interested in re-
solving personal drug problems may
seek guidance from University phy-
sicians, the Dean of Students, and
his staff; in seeking such aid, stu-
denis may rest assured they do not
risk disciplinary action. Although
conversations with these persons do
not enjoy immunity from court in-
quiry, they are under no obligation
to initiate reporting of drug offenses
and would do so only in clearly dan-
gerous and extraordinary situations.

University Council:
Some Solutions

The recently instituted University Council has surely es-
tablished a favorable impression. From all appearances this
body seems to offer some solutions to the myriad of questions
facing W&L. This group has allowed students and members
of the faculty to confront each other on issues involving the
university. More importantly, this body possesses the power
to alleviate existing problems and avert possible problems in
the future.

Two major problems were openly and articulately mastered
by the council this weekend. The first involved Independent
Exams. By an overwhelming vote, the University Council
endorsed the independent procedure and staved off any im-
mediate possibility of reinstating the old system. Drugs and
the role of the university was the second problem to be ex-
amined. The council approved a policy that expounded the
risks of the students using drugs, plus the position the school
would adhere to in drug problems. It should be noted that the
council recommended a sympathetic and workable policy to-
ward drug users who seek help.

The above pair of answers has been long needed. Until
now the students and faculty members lacked a clear under-
standing of how other people connected with the university
felt about these problems. Now with expediency and clarity
these questions have been dealt with.

The University Council is sizeable (over 20 members) and
for the most part composed of interested individuals. Opinions
expressed in Saturday's session were diverse, and sincere. The
members of the council shared a single desire—to protect the
best interests of Washington and Lee University.

Perhaps the most refreshing attitudes were presented by
the faculty and administration members. As one student dele-
gate admitted after the meeting, “they really care; they are
serious about getting things done.”

Why should the faculty members not care? W&L is their
school too. Quite candidly, the faculty members did care and
were better prepared for discussion of issues than the students
who attended.

What about parietals? Is coeducation feasible or even de-
sirable? How fair is the current grading system’ These are
some questions that await solutions from the University
Council.

_ the recently instituted University Council has surely
established a favorable impression. Yet, first impressions are
often misleading. It is hoped that the initial impressions given
by the University Council will not follow this adage. Too many
problems need answers.

There was a University Council meeting Saturday morn-
ing. This may be news to Mr. Bruce Madison, Mr. Don Weir,
Mr. Marshall Washburn, Mr. Rob Schatz, and Mr. Hap Stein.
These gentlemen did not quite make it to the session.

You may wonder how many of the ancient, aloof, and
apathetic faculty members were present? The answer is that
all 17 faculty members attended the meeting.

It was revealed this week that
some twenty-eight girls are planning
to attend W&L next year under the
exchange program involving eight
single-sex colleges in Vinginia and
North Carolina. According to Dean
William J. Watt, W&L’s program
supervisor, Hollins College will be
most heavily represented, alomg with
several students from Mary Baldwin
College,, Randolph-Macon Woman’s
College and Sweet Briar Colleges.

 

There is but one W&L student
participating in the program next
year, sophomore Bruce David Lorch,
who plans to further his Religion
study at Sweetbriar.

Although the number of girls

planning to study here next year has
been somewhat fluid in recent weeks,
and plans could be changed for a

ber, W&L is assured of tremendous

Goshen Classic Returns,
Featuring Tubing, Beer

After a year’s layoff, Washington
and Lee's famous Goshen Tubing
Classic is trying to make a come-
back. The classic, which in past years
was put on by the IFC and limited to
entrants from indiivdual fraternities,
will this year be put on by the Stu-
dent Committee for Planning and
Development and will be open to
all, inchiding girls and couples who
wish to enter the race.

Ihe reason for the change in spon-
sorship is due to the formation of
the new committee and the duties it
must try and perform. The commit-
tee’s sole purpose is to try and raise
money for the university through
joint student action. The group is in
the process of trying to raise $1000
in the next six weeks; if that amount
can be raised it will be matched by
an interested donor.

The race has been scheduled for
May 8 from 10:30 am. until 2:00

of the program. The chairman of
the exchange consortium, Mary
Baldwin’s Dr. Mink has concluded,
both from surveys taken throughout
the year and from comments receiv-
ed from this year’s participants, that
generally the program has been an
encouraging success.

No one can seem to detenmine the
reason for the relatively small num-
ber of male participants in the pro-
gram, but Dean Watt pointed out
that this has been generally the case,
not only at W&L, but at Davidson
and other male colleges in the con-

BY MARC SMALL

It has been said that every genera-
tion produces its own ‘barbarians,
and ours is as afflicted as any: our
Vandals now burn ROTC ‘buildings
instead of libraries, our Goths now
kill police officers rather than Rom-
an legionaries, and our Huns now
ravage Berkeley and San Rafael in-
stead of Italy, but the sentiment is
identical. We have raised and toler-
ated that generation of vipers in our
midst whose lawless disrespect for
reality and logic are rapidly widen-
ing the cracks in our society and has-
tening the eventual return of the
Dark Ages.

These new barbarians display all
the attributes of those that toppled
the senile Roman Empire: they are
leaches on a society that they can
not understand and which they will
eventually leave, a dry husk, to shine
through the eons as “the glory that
was Rome.” They brag of their
alienation, of their lack of under-
standing of the complexities our cul-
ture has developed in its five thous-
and years of development. They are
proud of their inability to add to the
accomplishments of the society they
work so hard to destroy. It is a diffi-
cult and subtle thing to realize the
complete break these barbarians
have made with our technological
past: they have not only left the
world of mechanical progress, but
they utilize their full abilities to
bring ovr industrial world to its
knees while enjoying the benefits of
mass production motorcycles and
dope smuggled in aircraft.

less vociferous in their criticisms of
the plan as have some of the female
participants. However, Lorch added,
“I don’t think it’s going to be a vaca-
tion, by any means.”

The vast majority of the exchange
coeds at W&L next year will remain
for all three academic terms, ac-
cording to Dean Watt, but two or
three have registered only for a sin-
gle term. Several of the girls were
motivated to come to W&L by
courses in the department of jour-
nalism an dcommunications. In ad-
dition, the girl’s courses will mainly
comprise English, the fine arts, and
psychology.

Exactly what the program means
for W&L beyond adding a few pretty
faces to the campus scene is uncer-
tain. The administration does not see
the program as any prelude to a
more ambitious co-ed experience in
the future, but Dean Watt said that
one virtue of the program, besides
providing a wider variety of offer-
ings, is a “convenient way for us to
get some girls in the classroom.”

  

 

the physiocrat, or the health nut;
rather I condemn those hypocritical
parasites who work to the detriment
of the society that nurtures them.
It is this stark hatred of scientific
and cultural progress, this belief that
one should live through stealing the
rewards of another's labour, that
epitomizes the most vile aspects of
the barbarians, yet it is not found
alone in the mad ‘bombers or street
rabble that occasionally pollute our
capital: indeed, the small-town Bab
bitt and bureaucrat are probably as
susceptible to barbarism as Theodo
ric the Visigoth and a great deal
more conscious of the consequences
of their actions. When New York
City decides not to build any more
power stations or cables, but to force
users to cut back, when political pro-
cesses are forgotten for murder and
destruction, then the worst attributes
of both covert and overt barbarism
are displayed. In short, we live in an
age in which the dominant society no
longer is able or willing to cast oul
the gnats that afflict it and who, by
sheer weight, will eventually haul it
down.

None of wus will be alive when the
next Dark Age comes, for its advent
is still decades or centuries in the
future. Rather, we sit at the water
shed when the first cracks appear
and it becomes appareni—to the
few—that the decline and fall have
begun and it is but a matter of time
until the inexorable tide of human
progress will bring mankind into the
black night of ignorance and fea
from which there shall spring al

Super Sophomore Paul Suthern
continued his winning ways and was
the Blue’s only winner on the track
against VMI. A double winner
against Roanoke, Suthern took the
high hurdles in 15.0 and the 440
intermediates in 59.9. He again won
the highs at VMI and, as was the
case in Roanoke, Bill Wallace was
close on his theels for second. Steve

out the W&L sweep of ‘the inter-

lief of all knowledgeable spectators,
W&L won the mile relay for the first
time in over three years. Bob Sher-
wood and Paul Wilbur took 2-3 in
the mile at Roanoke and Sherwood
took third also at VMI. Freshman
Larry Alexander was called upon to
run the quarter for the first time and
responded with a 53.4 victory at
Roanoke followed by a respectable

in the winter with championships in
swimming and basketball. Sewanee
won the wrestling chanypionship.

LaRue’s Press Box

This and That

Heard here and there while -wait-
ing for the electricity to come back
on... Canonero II, Saturday's sur-
prise Kentucky Derby winner, was
not only the first foreign entry to
win the Run for the Roses, but also
the first field horse to claim victory
. . . Sadly, field status knocked the
winner's payoff down to $19.40, de-
spite 50 to 1 odds,

It should be interesting to see just
where the San Francisco Giants fin-
ish up this season. . . Their man-
ager, Clyde King predicted before
the season's start that the team
which got off to a big jump early
would most likely win the Western
Division pennant. Currently, King’s
Giants have lost only five of their
first twenty-four games, giving them
a comfortable six game lead.

Ice hockey, generally associated
with cold weather, is considered a
winter sport. And yet, with May and
warm weather's arrival, at least in
most places, one finds two National
Hockey League clubs still doing bat-
tle in a best-of-seven series for the
Stanley Cup.

Out in Indianapolis, preparations
are already underway for the fifty-
fifth Indy 500, to be run May 29.
Saturday marked the first day of
time trials and practice sessions.

Although Washington and Lee’s
baseball team is still having its
troubles winning, the Generals are
optimistic about chances for a top
spot in the CAC spring tournament
this weekend in St. Louis .. . The
diamond Generals have ‘been receiv-
ing improved pitching in their last
few outings. Haller Jackson looked
strong against Wilmington and Don
McMillan went the distance in a 5-1
loss to touted High Point... And

most impressive .. .

Danville’s Market Garden Field,
site of last weekend's baseball ac-
tion, is a jinxed park, as far as Vir-
ginia teams are concerned .. . Two
W&L players were injured during
the weekend, and two Lynchburg
College players left a game.

W&L Ruggers
Host Tourney

Washington and Lee’s Rugby Club
will play host to its Fourth Annual
Invitational Tournament on Satur-
day and Sunday, ‘May 8 and 9. A
strong field will be on hand to test
the Generals.

Teams invited to participate in the
event, are Princeton, the Ivy League
champion, Virginia Tech, which will
carry an undefeated record into the
competition, the University of Vir-
ginia, the University of South Caro-
lina, Hampden Sydney, Virginia
Military Institute, Lynchburg Col-
lege, and the host Generals.

Both the middle and upper fields
will ‘be employed in conducting the
tournament, which is the highlight
of the club's season, and which
should furnish spectators a good
look at a fast-growing college sport.

The Washington and Lee Club
has progressed steadily this year,
with a key victory coming against
‘Hampden-Sydney two weeks ago.
The Generals downed the Tigers 5-3
on a score by Bill Anderson. The
bustle of freshman Dave Campbell
also helped the W&L victory.

 

The nationally ranked lacrosse team returns home Saturday.

UC Discusses

Drugs, Exams

(Continued from page 1)

He pointed out that 12 per cent of
the students surveyed admitted they
heard something about the examina-
tions. Atwood said, “There is less
security under the Independent
Exams as there was under the previ-
ous system. 1 am willing to accept
that but I do not want to make a
statement that the security is as good
as it was in the past. The word ‘re-
lative’ (mentioned in the statement
in relation to security of the Honor
System) upsets me.”

Professor Imeson commented “this
group is in agreement that there is
sufficient security. It seems that it is
our opinion that Independent Exam
procedure does not upset the exam
process.”

Student Body President Steve Rob-
inson added, “there is enough re-
sponsibility accepted by students for
independent exams to continue.”

The statement was approved with
no dissenting votes. In part the Uni-
versity Council statement read:

“The University Council respect-
fully recommends to the faculty that
the current procedure of independent
exam scheduling be continued for
the next academic year.

“Further, it is the Council's belief
that independent exams are highly
beneficial to the educational process
by placing a greater responsibility
on the individual student for the
substantive success or failure of his
academic career. It is now the stu-
dent’s burden to determine his indi-
vidual goals and study needs and to
respond accordingly.

“It is our view that no schedule can
guarantee complete security of the
subject matter of examinations. It is
also clear that the current examina-
tion schedule gives the chance for
more information to be disseminat-

ed, whether inadvertently or not.
Nevertheless, we believe that the

sibility thus far and consider this as
sufficient evidence that the value of
the independent exam procedure, as
an educational tool, is not signifi-
cantly impaired.”

Immediately after this vote, Bob
Carrere introduced the subject of
dorm parietals, He said, “I under-
stand the dorm councilors will pre-
sem recommendation to the SAC.
I think we should at least discuss it.”

It was decided that discussion
would be postponed until the matter
is studied by the SAC.

Law student Charlie Hofheimer
brought up the issue of proxy fights
involving stocks owned by W&L. He
recommended that a method be es-
tablished by which anyone concern-
ed over proxy fights can approach
the Board of Trustees Finance Com-
mittee.

Dean Atwood explained the cur-
rent status of ROTC courses. ROTC
courses are now open to audit under

E.C. Selects New Leadership
For ’72 Mock Convention

The Executive Committee in
closed session Monday evening ap-
pointed junior Tom Gillespie and
law student Mike Campulongo as
permanent co-chairmen of the 1972
Mock Convention. They replace
Dan Silverberg, who has been serv-
ing as interim chairman this year.

Gillespie has been in charge of
campus affairs and state delegations
for the convention, and he will con-
tinue in that capacity as co-chair-
man. Campulongo will handle the
arrangements beyond this campus,
specifically coordination with na-
tional Democratic party politics.

According to President of the Stu-
dent Body, Fran Lawrence, Silver-
berg had a teaching assignment in
California during the present spring

Reynolds Price
In Residence

One of the premier Southern
novelists of our time, Reynolds
Price, has commenced a two-week
residency on campus, under the au-
spices of the Arthur and Margaret
Glasgow Endowment program. His
visit highlights this year’s “spring
events in the arts,” the structural
theme of which is “Words and
Music”.

Mr. Price, who was awarded the
William Faulkner Prize for the best
novel of 1962, arrived in Lexington
early this week. He will deliver a
formal lecture in DuPont Auditor-
ium at 8:15 p.m. on Monday, May
7, In addition, the author will be
available for several seminars and
for student consultation.

The emphasis of this year’s Glas-
vow program is on student participa-
tion. Students who have mamuscripts
and would like them to be read by
Mr. Price are urged to hand them in
to Mr. James Boatwright of the Eng-
lish department as soon as possible.

Conferences may then be arranged

with Price for discussion and criti-
cism.

During his stay at W&L, the au-
thor will participate in several for-
wms on the arts and creative writing.
Phere will be an open seminar on
the techniques of fiction on Wednes-
day, May 19 at 3:30 pam. The Jour-
nalism film seminar will host Mr.
Price next Tuesday morning; this,
ioo, will be open to any interested
persons.

Price, a native of North Carolina,
graduated from Duke University and
studied in Britain for three years as
a Rhodes Scholar. He is presently
an associate professor at Duke, and
he has served as writer-in-residence
at the Universities of Kansas and
North Carolina,

Last Monday evening, Price offer-
ed a reading from several of his
among them “A Long and
Happy Life” (1962), “A Generous
Man” (1966), and “Love and Work”
(1968). His prose is vivid and mov-
ing, with moments of poignant inti-
macy most readily demonstrated
Monday evening by his readings
from a recent collection of short
“Permanent Errors”.

Critic and poet Allen Tate has
lauded Price as “the most original
Southern writer to appear in this de-
cade, and the most sensitive prose
stylist of his generation.”

term, and the E. C. felt that the Con-
vention chairman “needed to be on
campus during the summer preced-
ing the Convention.” He also re-
marked that the E.C. had certain
“misunderstandings” with Silverberg
concerning plans for the enterprise.

Lawrence added that the chairman
of the 1968 convention, Steve Saun-
ders, will be visiting Lexington in
the near future for consultation with
this year’s Mock Convention leader-
ship. “With some hard work from
those involved, we'll have no worry,”
said Lawrence. “The real push will
come during the summer” when im-
portant preliminary arrangements
must be made.

Charles Wuorinen a 1970 Pulitzer
(Prize Winner will co-direct “The
Group for Contemporary Music” at
W&L during the week of May 18.
The group will be in residence under
the auspices of the Arthur and Mar-
garet Glasgow Endowment program.

Wourinen is a composer and
pianist whose works have been per-
formed extensively throughout the
world. The group also includes Har-
vey Sollberger, composer and flutist,
who is the co-director along with
Wuorinen, Fred Sherry performs as

is the group’s percussionist.

Of particular interest to students
should be the group's plans to aide
student composers. Throughout the
week-long period the musicians will
be available for consultation with
interested students.

“The Group for Contemporary
Music” will participate in a mixed-
media student production scheduled
for May 20. Wuorinen will deliver a
lecture during his stay as well.

The structural theme for the
Glasgow program this spring is
“Words and Music”. The Glasgow
Endowment program was originated
in 1960 through a bequest from Ar-
thur Glasgow to “promote the art of
expression by pen and tongue.”

The group is based at Columbia
University. All the members are dis-
tinguished men of music, Wuorinen
won the Pulitzer Prize, as was pre-
viously mentioned, for his work,
“Time's Encomium”. Wuorinen re-
ceived the Brandeis Creative Aris
citation in music in 1970,

Co-director Soliberger is an assis-
tant professor of music at Columbia.
He has been awarded a Guggenheim
grant and an award from the Na-
tional Institute of Arts and Letters.

and has performed in America and
Europe. He is a cofounder of the
Speculum Musicae, which perform-
ed its first concert recently in New

key, this year’s chairman of the Stu-
dent Financial Relations Committee.
‘He asserted that, on the basis of his
committee’s experience with bounced
checks this year, that some stricter
measure should be taken against
“chronic offenders,” those up for
their third violation or more. Harkey
suggested either the E.C. discipline
directly these students, or that the
Student Financial Relations Commit-
tee be authorized to write the stu-
dent’s home bank to recommend the
closing of his account.

“As long as it is understood that
discretion would be used, I think
this is a good idea,” commented Sta-
man Ogilvie. He emphasized that
care must be taken in the wording of
such letters addressed to home banks
and that such a strong measure
would be used only in the case of a
knowing, multiple offender.

The EC then passed a resolution
giving authority to the Financial Re-
lations committee for “more strin-
gent measures” to curb cold checks.

Matt Cole proposed that Contact
funds normally collected in the regi-
stration line be inchided next year
in the student tax. He also sought in-
vestment of $1000 into the reserve
fund, as insurance against any unfor-
seen financial dilemma.

Joe Tompkins added that plans
had been made to incorporate $3.00
per student for Contact in the $200
tuition rise coming next year. A
motion was passed establishing these
arrangements for Contact and stipu-
lating that interest from Contact
money be returned annually to the
Contact program.

In addition to the Mock Conven-
tion appointments, the E.C. discuss-
ed the Gilliam Award and other

THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
May 12, 1971

 

“Fundamental to all other aspirations of Washington and
Lee University are...the pursuit of its educational purpose
in a climate of learning that stresses the importance of the
individual, his personal honor and integrity...”
From the University’s formal statement of
institutional philosophy
“The members of each residential unit of 40 to 50 students
will reach a consensus on the standards of social responsibility
which they will abide by during the academic year... As part
of its statement of social responsibility, each residential unit
may establish social hours within the following guidelines:
5:00 p.m. Friday to 12:00 Midnight Sunday (with the under-
standing that overnight visitations are prohibited).”
From Dormitory Regulations 1970-71

Girls spend the night in the dormitories. It must seem hard
to believe but it is true. That is correct, girls (that is plural)
have actually made “overnight visitations” in Washington and
Lee’s dormitories.

A dormitory counselor made this startling revelation to
The Ring-tum Phi. He had substantial proof that this year
women had been in the dorms for an entire evening, directly
affronting the rule stated above.

Why have the culprits, who permitted females to sleep
in their residences, been allowed to remain unscathed? The
answer is that nobody turned the villains in to the the proper
authorities such as the Student Affairs Committee or Student
Control Committee.

Perhaps a more appropriate question is—why is it that
no one collared these individuals and submitted them to
punishment? It seems that students view the parietals as
something “for the parents and alumni.” An upperclassman
summed up the situation this way: “the parietals are on the
books for appearance, not enforcement.”

That being the case, we should pose another question—
why should such rules exist at all? They are not enforced,
respected or seemingly needed.

We are told that Washington and Lee aspires to the
purposes of individualism, honor and integrity. But the school
requires freshmen to reside in the university maintained dorms.
Granted the life in these dorms is subject to self-regulation
to a limited degree. But these limitations dominate female
visitation hours.

It is unfair to ask a student to become an unreasonable
informer on his fellow students. The dormitory dwellers have
always been confronted with this issue. Turning to a parallel
problem, the W&L men drank in the dorms for years. The
guys down the hall largely ignored drinking in the dorms and
eventually drinking was allowed officially, or at least it was
not banned.

Girls have stayed in the dorms, are staying in the dorms
and probably will stay in the dorms. The rules do not erase
these realities. Parietals accomplish little except putting a
student under the threat of reprisals.

It must be admitted that the university should retain some
control over the dormitory life. The actual facilities belong
to the school and the school must bear the cost of maintain-
ing and repairing those facilities. For that reason the uni-
versity can and does charge for damage to the dormitories.

Also it can be argued that common decency should prevail
in the dormitories. Problems would arise if girls were allowed
throughout the dormitories without restriction, Therefore,
W&L can justify rules that stipulate gentlemanly conduct
and respect for the right of others.

However, justification seems to be lacking for keeping
women out of the dorms during the week or forbiding them
to remain overnight. Washington and Lee espouses integrity
and honor among its students. If students were allowed to
establish their own standards for social conduct in the dormi-
tories, a significant step would be taken toward encouraging
student integrity and honor.

sob Carrere has introduced discussion in the University
Council concerning parietals. We appeal to this council to
re-examine and re-evaluate the merits and faults of parietals.
If need be, this body can carry out a remedy to this problem
under its authority concerning student affairs. Parietals can
be eliminated if the University Council acts,

Unless the parietal regulation can be justified by Wash-
ington and Lee University in the spirit of its above stated
purposes, the parietals should not be allowed to exist,

Whitehead Explains Bud. get

The year 1971 has been a period
of economic uncertainty, evidenced
iby the fact many businesses have fall-
en into bad financial straits. Institu-
tions of higher education are not im-
mune to such problems. Washington
and Lee must pay its bills like any
other business. This article will at-
tempt to examine how well W&L has
done in its attempt to stay in the
black.

In the 1960-1961 fiscal year the
university maintained an expense
ibudget of $2,186,000. Today, just a
decade later, that expense budget has
increased to $5,452,000. Evidently,
running a school has ‘become a more
and more expensive undertaking.

James W. Whitehead, University
Treasurer, analyzed the financial
status of W&L for The Ring-tum
Phi. Whitehead elaborated on the
five million dollar operational bud-
get for this year. He explained that
this figure includes only operational
costs, and excluded capital expenses
such as the expansion of Doremus
Gymnasium.

Fifty-four per cent of the expenses
in the budget are classified as in-
structional. Included in this category
are salaries of the faculty and edu-
cational expenses, Twenty-seven per-
cent of this year’s budget is allotted
to student and public services, which
would encompass the funds needed
for scholarships, the dining hall, the
University Center, and infinmary.
‘Plant operation and maintenance
utilized ten per cent of the W&L
budget. Administration totaled five
percent of operational expenses.

Most colleges and universities are
faced with monetary problems.
Whitehead added that, “a general
trend has emerged across the nation
for colleges. There is an annual in-
crease of about ten per cent in ex-
penses.”

Tuition at W&L gives about half
of the money needed to operate the
services at the school. However, tui-
tion is scheduled to rise over the
next two years. This is not a strange
phenomenon, most private institu-
tions have been forced to do the

Compared with similar schools,
W&L’s tuition is low. Four of the

BY LEX McMILLAN

The honor system is dead. It has
‘been dead for a long time but pres-
ently hangs over us as yet unburied.
The time has come to bury the past,
recognize the present and plan for
the future. Our system is a primitive
and tribalistic concept surrounded
by an intensely bureaucratic and
complexly diverse world. It has one
rule which is incredibly vague and
subject to a panorama of interpreta-
tions and understandings. It exists on
the assumption that a Washington
and Lee student will not lie, cheat
or steal. This is merely the top-coat
of the assumption behind the system.
Another is that there exists some

colleges in the exchange program
have a higher tuition. Only David-
son, Hampden-Sydney, and Ran-
dolph-Macon charge their students
less. For the 1970-1971 year W&L
tuition was less than the tuition at
such schools as: Amherst, Bowdoin,
‘Brown, Dartmouth, Duke, Emory,
Franklin & Marshall, Hamilton,
‘Harvard, Haverford, Hobart, Ken-
yon, Lafayette, Princeton, Trinity
(Conn.), Union, Wabash, Washing-
ton & Jefferson, Wesleyan and Wil-
liams.

Whitehead continued, “most in-

t

stitutions have found a limit to the
amount that can ‘be charged for
tuition. It does not make them com-
petitive to charge high tuition. Once
you raise tuition you must raise
more money for financial aid or
you will lose some students. We
think our tuition is low enough to
be competitive.”

In summary of Washington and
Lee's financial status Treasurer
Whitehead stated, “We are operat-
ing on a balanced budget. We have
for the previous years and expect to
do the same in the future. This

“Says

 

means if income went down some
exipenses would have to be cut.”

“We are financially ‘sound’ ”,
Whitehead summarized. “Our stab-
ility of income is what keeps W&L
financially sound. This stable in-
come has included tuition, endow-
ment, gifts, and grants.”

Washington and Lee seems to be
doing better than many schools in
recent years in financial matters. At
least W&L can make the claim that
it is Operating in the black, a claim
that makes quite a few college treas-
urers jealous,

Letters To The Editor

RING-TUM PHI
LETTER POLICY

The Ring-tum Phi encourages let-
ters to the editor. Letters must be
typed and signed. In order to appear

 

kind of clear consensus in our com-
munity which defines lying, cheating
and stealing. This consensus simply
does not exist.

The Executive Committee is sup-
posed to determine the non-existing
consensus as representative menrbers
of the community. Aside from the
very important fact that they are
not representative, the task of deter-
mining or rather deciding on a con-
sensus is extremely arbitrary, awe-
some in its ramifications for the ac-
cused and essentially impossible.
‘How can one expect there to be a
consensus when the members of our
community come from all over the
United States as well as various
parts of the world, have diverse
social, economic and moral back-
grounds and also share the unique-
ness of being individual human be-

a game with frighteningly high
stakes, give them a very vague sense
of the rules and then arbitrarily eli-

Generals § lip

BY ROGER MUNSICK

Washington and Lee finished a
close third in competition for the
College Athletic Conference overall
sports championship last weekend
in St. Louis.

Washington University of Si.
Louis, the defending champion, re-
peated as overall winner, with 165
points, Sewanee overhauled WAI
for second place with a strong
spring showing and 137'% points
and the Generals followed with 135
points, Southwestern and Centre had
127% and 110 points respectively

In the all decisive spring competi
tion, Washington captured the rain
swept baseball competition with a
4-0) record and took second in both
track and tennis. Sewanee narrowly
edged WAL for the golf title and
also won the tennis crown, South
western took the track,

Besides its close second in golf,
WAL placed fourth in tennis and
baseball, and fifth in track

WAL and perennial CAC links
powerhouse Sewanee had identical
scores of 305 in the golf competi
tion, which was shortened to eigh

teen holes by the rain. Sewanee,
however, won by a three stroke
margin when the tie-breaking meth
od was employed

WAL Captain Ken Carter of New
Orleans was individual medalist in
the tourney with a two over par 72
Teammates Jack Marquess and Tom
Kent followed for the Generals with

The teams were tightly bunched in
the golf competition, Southwestern
took third with 307, Centre was
only 5 shots back of the winners at
310, and Washington followed with
415

Tennis, usually a high point of
competition for the Generals, was
ulso hotly contested this year. South
western captured the title with 35
points, edging the Washington Bears

WAL with 22, and Centre with 18

Schatz Replies

To the Editors:

The Washington and Lee Univer-
sity community benefits from the
fact that their chronicle of events,
The Ring-tum Phi is only issued once
a week. In that way, the student
populace is misled less frequently
than if the paper were issued on a
daily basis.

As 4 newspaper, you have an un-
questionable obligation to report the
facts—not some of the facts, but
ALL of them.

I cannot and would not speak for
any other member of the University
Council who was absent from our
last meeting. I can only inform The
Ring-tum Phi as to what it should
have taken the trouble to find out
for itself in regard to my absence: |
was representing your university at
my own expense alt the annual
American Society of International
Law convention, in Washington. In
fact, it was almost as boring as your

newspaper.
Robert B. B. Schatz
Law ‘72

The Ring-tum Phi did attempt to dis-
cover Mr. Schatz’ whereabouts dur-
ing the last University Council
meeting. Council Chairman Steve
Robinson informed us that no one
knew why he was not there or where

he was. It seems if this representative
was going to undertake this trip he
could have at least told the chair-
man in advance that he would be ab-
sent. In addition if Mr. Schatz feels
an obligation to continue such ex-
cursions and consequently be absent
from the council meeting, he cannot
effectively carry out his office. How-
ever, we give Mr. Schatz the benefit
of the doubt and withhold final
judgment, We will gauge his earnest
interest in the University Council by
his attendance at the remaining
meetings. Ed,

Woodley Comments

Dear Sir:

Mr. Hinely’s acceptance in his re-
cent article of Jerry Rubin's absurd
equation of Soviet Russia, the vilest
and most obscene regime ever to
crush the humanity from a whole
people, and the Roman Catholic
Church, the instrument responsible
for what civilization and progress oc-
curred in the Western world for a
period of some ten centuries, seems
to be indicative of the extent to
which generalizations based upon
vague notions of historical trends
and events can work to capture com-
pletely the imagination of an other-
wise quite reasonable mind.

The concept of an Utopia is, ad-
mittedly, a very compelling one. The
idea, however, that an abandonment
of all vestiges of selfishness would
result in such a society makes as
sumptions as to the nature of human
existence which are not only unde-

Brown were named Monday to com-

among about half a dozen teams
fighting for the remaining three spots
and a strong showing this afternoon
is crucial to the Generals’ cause.
Both of this afternoon's contes-
tants come off exciting games this
weekend. Virginia pulled out a one
goal victory over Maryland, and
with it the ACC championship, on a
long-shot goal by their goalie with
only seconds to play. Washington
and Lee was devastating in romping
over Loyola of Maryland, 17 to 1.
The Generals scored first against

   
 

Loyola, 57 seconds into the game,
on a goal by Sam Englehart. All-
American Whit Morrill scored less
than a minute later for a 2-0 lead,
and from then on W&L completely
dominated everything.

Washington and Lee fired 72 shots
at the goal during the course of the
afternoon, and the Generals’ attack
men raced quickly through a lagging
Loyola defense. The W&L face-off
play was also especially strong.

By halftime, the score had mount-
ed to 11-0 on three more goals by

Szlasa Expects

‘Tough Games’

The following are excerpts from
an interview yesterday between The
Ring-tum Phi and W&L lacrosse
coach Dick Szlasa.

“The final three places for the
NOAA tournament will be decided
Sunday evening. Our game against
Virginia and Hofstra’s game with
Virginia on Saturday will probably
decide one of the places.

“We've got another tough game
coming up Saturday against Duke
which has a very fine team. I almost
wish the games (Duke and Virginia)
were reversed.

“I think we're in a better position
to play Virginia than ever before.
We've got good middies, lots of
depth, enthusiasm and most impor-
tant: unselfishness. Virginia’s big ad-
vantage is that they've got a lot more
speed than we do.

“We've come a long way this year.
I’m surprised at the team’s success. I
thought we were still a year away,
‘but we have a lot of enthusiasm and
it’s been a real team effort. Then,
too, we have three seniors (All-
Americans Bill Brumback and Whit
Morrill and All-Division Bill Inger-
soll) who are having their ‘best sea-
son ever.”

Berth

Tompkins, Bill Brumback and John
Lalley.

Frequent substitutions in the sec-
ond half failed to halt the Generals’
attack. Tompkins, Neese, Bill Rien-
hoff, Jim Farrar, and Jim Stieff, all
scored to make the tally an absurd
16-0 before Loyola broke up the
shutout in the fourth period.

Freshman standout Skip Lichtfuss’
goal in the final minute capped the
Generals victory.

This Saturday at 2:00, the stick-
men close out the regular season in
a crucial Wilson Field encounter
against Duke.

Don't ask what happened at the
College Athletic Conference tourna-
ment over the weekend. It was a dis-
aster for Washington and Lee from
the start.

One look at the airplane and we
knew we were headed downhill.
First, pitcher Bill Greener, who
would never think of being late,
missed the bus to Roanoke and got a
ride to the airport. And that YS 11A
we flew with two stops in Louisville,
and get this, London-Corbin, Ken-
tucky, was vintage 1945. We used
up so many air sickness bags that the
stewardess had to get some more on
the second stop. I personally used
three.

Things weren't any better once we
got to St. Louis, as our charter land-

alert. We hustled for the Colony
Motor Court, one of the few high
spots of the trip, after receiving a
conflicting set of directions. Rain
forced the cancellation of most acti-
vities until Friday afternoon, but
the damage had been done, as the
golf was halved to eighteen holes
and the baseball games were short-
ened to five innings, three of which
had to be played back to back.

That’s not to excuse W&L’s show-
ing, which was poor on the whole.
The track team was outclassed, but
the real crime was committed by
the baseball team. We were the best
team there, but we didn’t play like it.
After that heart-breaking, 1-0 loss to
Washington in the ninth inning, the
Generals went home. I don't know
how well we looked in tennis, but I
hear it was bad. Only golf, which

And just a few side notes from
the CAC ... Half of the baseball
games were played in the outfield of
WU’s bball diamond, with a tempor-
ary mound constructed and anything
hit on the ground into right field was
a groundrule single . . . The CAC
received a jolt with Washington’s
withdrawal from conference basket-
ball competition, one of the “major”
conference sports. And rumor has it
that an even bigger shake-up is on
the way with some of the other
schools . . . Nobody should com-

plain about the umpires, at least not

in baseball. The crew that worked
the ball games was the best ever in

Columnist McMillan Condemns
Present W&L Honor System

(Continued from page 2)

men decide they have violated the
community sense of honor. A sense
of honor which is never defined. The
absurdity and inequity inherent in
this seems to be shamefully evident.
How can we judge people for trans-
gressions of which they are never
previously informed?

Not only is the concept behind the
system unrealistic and unworkable,
the mechanics of a trial are incred-
ibly unfair to the accused. He is
snatched up in stealth and carted off
to extensive and intensive grilling
by the Executive Committee. He
does not have time to prepare a de-
fense, does not have the (benefit of
counsel in general answers to
the impromptu procedural decisions
of the Exeoutive Committee. All this
is justified ‘by calling the proceedings
an inquiry not an adversary pro-
ceeding. However, at the end of this
“inquiry” the student involved may
find himself convicted and on the rail
out of town. The manipulations
which the Executive Committee
makes can be easily done since there
is no clearcut structure here as in
the rest of the system.

As much as the bureaucracy in

which we live awes, intimidates and

disgusts many, it is nevertheless a
very real part of our American soc-
iety. If there is one very concrete
thing which all students hold in
common, it is their lifelong exposure
to a society of bureaucracy. We are
all acoustomed to asking for a rule
ibook and getting it. Personal judg-
ment is a fine and necessary aspect
of a bureaucracy but no bureaucratic
society can exist on this alone, This
is what we have been trying to do.
It will not work and it does not
work.

We need to codify the honor sys-
tem. As it now stands individuals
face an increasingly unfair and un-
predictable future. To deny the nec-
essity of this seems to be a refusal
to face the nature of our system. It
is a plunge backwards into primitive
tribalism in which the “elders” arbi-
trarily decide the fate of a tribe
member who has not been raised in
the mores and laws of the tribe. If
we all grew up together here on this
campus and had been ingrained from
childhood with the yea’s and nay’s
of the tribe, then perhaps our sys-
tem could be justified. As it now
stands, our systems is very like what
would happen if a vast number of
tribes contributed a few individuals
to create a new tribe and only one
of the contributing tribes customs
was acknowledged and all others
were taboo and punishable by exile.

We are being bound and smother-
ed by a system created by men of the
past who lived in another world. We
sacrifice people to a system which
we dare not change as if some aura
of holiness pervaded it. As we stand
in Obedient awe and resist change.
individuals are ‘being dealt with un-
justly and receiving scars which can
affect their entire lives. It is time to
change and we must act now. This
is a matter which does not merit
procrastination nor can our com-
munity afford it.

Woodley Comments
(Continued from page 2)

monstrable ‘but patently ridiculous.
Mr. Hinely is correct in his analysis
of the selfish basis for anti-welfare
philosophy. Why, why, why should
my energy ‘be directed to the preser-
vation of another's state of life, if I
don’t want it to be?

Disregarding the parenthetical,
and pathetic, assertion that national
boundaries are meaningless because
of radio and TV, we come to the
greatest piece of philosophical gym-
nastics of all. It goes like this: Men
must ‘become unselfish, subordinate
there goes, and subjugate themselves
to a communist system which will
redistribute what they own and what
they create, in order to truly become
individuals and find themselves “tops
in their field, because we are all diff-
erent.”

Finally, there is Mr. Hinely’s at-
tack on what he called the “rat race.”
Put simply, it refers to any attempt
to raise the conditions and enjoy-
ment of life ‘by increasing one’s in-
come through advancement. Personal
wealth, as well as all the joys, pleas-
ures, and conveniences that go with
it, is selfish, Mr. Hinely says, and
therefore evil. There is also the
somewhat paranoid and totally un-
supportable assertion that individual
striving to better conditions of life
will cause atomic holocaust or en-
vironmental catastrophe. Frankly, |
am not afraid of Mr. Hinely’s “rat
race.” The only reasons I can ima-
gine for being frightened are incom-
petence, indolence, or paranoia.

To attack someone for his beliefs
is a practice which is as dangerous as
it is counter-productive. However,
the careful consideration of attacks
on the beliefs themselves can only
result in a better understanding of
their nature. The concept of an Uto-
pia based on selflessness is, quite
simply, without ‘basis in reality.

LETTERS TQ THE EDITOR

Editor:

I have recently written my 100th
letter of recommendation this Spring.
In order to keep going in an effec-
tive sort of way, I would like to sug-
gest that those students who apply to
Law Schools and Graduate Schools
and who are accepted but choose not
to go, show the common courtesy to
write and thank the Admissions
Dean for having been accepted.

Every now and then I run into an
Admissions Dean who says: “Milton,
remember that student you recom-
mended to us... you know the one
you said was “alert, intellectually
curious, and a man of unfailing
courtesy, well we accepted him and
we never got an answer...

Gentlemen, get out your pen and
paper.

for one couple to all concerts, will
ibe offered to all students for $40.
“We are also confident that we will
be able to use the facilities of the
new gym, which has seating for
3600.” added Meem. “This will yield
us, therefore, more revenue at the
door.”

Meem said that the Dance Board
had explored the possibility of com-
ibining resources with either V.M.1.
or with one of the girls’ schools and
found this to be infeasible. Tickets at
the door for each concert, however,
will be available to any person at
$10 per couple and $5 per indivi-
dual.

PHIL THOMPSON

“To promote literature in this rising
empire and to encourage the arts
have ever been amongst the warmest
wishes of my heart.”

George Washington

Law senior Phil Thompson was
presented two of Washington and
Lee’s most prestigious awards—The
Gilliam Award, and The Ring-tum
Phi Award—at Thursday’s Senior
Banquet. Also receiving Ring-tum
Phi Awards for service were Dean
William W. Pusey and I-Hsiung Ju.

Thompson was Vice President of
the student body this year as well as
head dormitory counselor. He also
attended W&L as an undergraduate
and was a football captain.

Phe Frank J. Gilliam Award is
presented annually to that student
who has made the most valuable
contribution to student affairs in one
or more fields. The award is named
for Dean Emeritus Frank J. Gilliam
as a tribute to his long and devoted
service to Washington and Lee.

President R.E.R. Huntley made
the presentation of the award, In
accepting this honor Thompson ex-
ipressed his gratitude and revealed
he was very thrilled because Dean
Gilliam was the first person he had
met at W&L. Phil also mentioned
his deep respect and love for Dean

Gilliam who attended the ceremony.

The Ring-tum Phi Awards are
presented annually to members of
the University administration, fac-
ulty, staff, or student body who
have rendered outstanding service to
any phase of life at Washington and
Lee.

The citation for Dean Pusey stat-
ed, “It is not often that a university
—whether it be large or small—finds
itself blessed with an administrative
leader who is wholly dedicated to
the service of that institution. Wash-
ington and Lee has been blessed
with such a man. He teaches. He
administrates. But most of all, he
has given himself to W&L as a
teacher, Dean of the College, and
even as Acting President of the
University.”

Phil Thompson received the stu-
dent Ring-tum Phi Award. His cita-
tion read: “Not long ago a student
remarked to us that it was odd that
this recipient worked so hard in stu-
dent government when he ‘got noth-
ing out of it.’ We feel sure that if the
student had made the same remark

to our next recipient, he would have
laughed in his face. This man has
worked for the betterment of the
student government at Washington
and Lee ever since he entered this
university as a freshman. And if we
had to name his contribution to stu-
dent life and to the University as a

whole, we would have to put it in

one word: wisdom.”

I-Hsiung Ju received the final
Ring-tum Phi Award for service. In
awarding the plaque Editor-elect
John Robinson made this statement:
“This individual has not been at
Washington and Lee for any great
length of time. He is an artist whose
work at Washington and Lee has
given this university great and much-
needed recognition in the field of the
arts. But more importantly, this in-
dividual’s presence at this institution
has encouraged a new interest in the
arts among students. For his re-
strained exwherance in teaching and
his work for the cultural betterment
of this community as the artist-in-
residence, we present this Ring-tum
Phi Award to I-Hsiung Ju.”

Munsick, Paukert Selected As
Contact Symposium Chairmen

Roger Munsick of Summit, New
Jersey, and Skip Paukert of Atlanta
will serve as co-chairmen of next
year’s Contact symposium at Wash-
ington and Lee.

The two were elected last week by
joint Executive Committee-Interfra-
ternity Council selection committee.

Unlike past Contact presentations,
which attempted to center on a
specific theme, next year’s sympos-
ium is expected to be based largely
on a diverse discussions, with a wide
range of visiting speakers dealing
with their own fields of interest.
“Having worked on Contact °71”,
Paukert explained, “we have come
to realize that an in depth coverage
of nearly any given theme is impos-
sible within such a limited space of
time.”

“We really think that the majority
of the student body has become tired
of the highly political nature of

many of the speakers who have tak-
en part in the theme-oriented pro-
grams of the past few years. While
we may well sponsor some politi-
cians, men who will provide new or

Prof. Lewis Cite of Hollins and Dr, I-Heieng Ju display works from the

unusual perspectives on their topics,
we felt a concerted effort should be
made to include not only speakers
from varied fields, but also different
styles of presentation, such as per-
haps films, and exhibits,” Munsick
added.

“Our theme right now,” Paukert
continued,” is really just contact,
contact with a variety of human
problems and contact with issues
confronting our own university. We
hope very much to present seminars

headed by W&L faculty members.”

Munsick, a rising senior history
major is currently Managing Editor
of The Ring-tum Phi, and served as
vice chairman of Contact ‘71 which
spotlighted “The Crisis in Higher
Education.” Paukert, who double
majors in English and European
history, is News Editor of The Ring-
tum Phi and was a member of the
Steering Committee of this year's
symposium.

an Atlanta freshman, and Larry
Evans, a sophomore from San Fe-
lipe, Texas, grabbed eighth place in
their division of the tourney, ac-
cumulating a 4 and 2 record.

Simultaneously, W&L co-captains
Bob Bruyere of Houston and Andy
Bradshaw of Norge, Va., both sopho-
mores, also achieved a 4 and 2 rec-
ord taking tenth place in their divi-
sion. The ultimate victor of the
NYU contest was the strong forensic
team from Ohio State.

The New York University tourna-
ment, one of the most respected of
the annual national debate meets,
brought to a close a winning season
for the WAL debaters, who—though
nearly all underclassmen—brought
home three trophies and several
commendations as best team orf
speaker. “We were able to partici-
pate in some 15 tournaments from
Florida to New York,” said co<ap
tain Bruyere, “and, all in all, we
were quite pleased with the results.”

In addition to the four who tra
velled to NYU, active members of
the WAL team inchide: junior Cal
Seaton and Lenny Kaufman, Brian
MeNeil, and Averill Harkey, all
freshmen. “With a new coach, and
a basically inexperienced team, we

Have you ever been inside the

who Big Foot Wallace was? If you
are unable to answer either of these
questions in the affirmative then
your education at WAL is badly
lacking. But the problem can easily
be solved by taking one of the most
unique courses offered at WAL dur-
ing the Spring Term—Frencoh 201

This French “total immersion”
course is being tried for the first

2 THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK 'T'roubs Produce Russian Work

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

May 19,1971

Re: W&L Lacrosse
A Word of Praise...

National athletic reergnition has evaded Washington and
Lee for quite a few years. Some have grumbled that an un-

subsidized program would result in only mediocre showings

against athletic machines pumped full of cash and scholarships.
Some people over in Doremus Gymnasium did not acquiesce

to this verdict. A case in point is Coach Dick Szlasa and his

lacrosse squad. They have brought a division championship to

W&L,

In lacrosse matches the Generals went 11-2. The losses were
to top ranked Virginia and third ranked Navy. By any standard
that is quite an accomplishment. But when you consider that
W&L was a contender for a berth in the national post-season
tournament, it is quite an accomplishment indeed.

The eight teams finally selected for the tournament in-
cluded: Navy, Army, Air Force, Maryland, Virginia, Hofstra,
Cornell and Brown. Each of these schools is at least two times

as large as Washington and Lee. Being compared with schools

of this size is a remarkable showing.

\ division championship, a 11-2 record and national rank-

ing overcome the disappointment of not being invited to the

national tournament.

Coach

Szlasa and

the team should be

heartily commended! They have proven that W&L can com-

pete with anybody regardless of size or financial subsidization.

Word of Criticism...

\ large contingent of Washington and Lee men made the
trek over to Charlottesville last Wednesday to see the Univer-
sity of Virginia lacrosse match, Well over 300 students braved
the downpour to cheer for the Generals, So many W&L folks
were there at the outset of the game, that Wahoos arriving late
thought our side of the field was the U.Va. section.

In stark contrast to this genuine outpouring of school spirit

stood the activities of a few students. Gentlemanly conduct was

not exactly the order of the day. A steady barrage of beer cans

were tossed on the field. The officials and even players stopped

on several oceasions to remove these cans and other thrown

objects from the playing surface.

These actions resulted in a discredit to W&L and its tradi-

tions of gentlemanly conduct. A more important result may be

an adverse effect on W&L lacrosse recruiting. We doubt if any

lacrosse prospects would be overly impressed by this display.

It is hard enough to recruit high quality players without athletic

scholarships. There is no need to let the misconduct of a few

complicate the difficulty of the task of recruitment.

Word of Thanks...

If you were listening to the radio last week you might have

heard an unusual advertisement. The announcer told of taking a

bus over to Charlottesville for the U.Va. lacrosse game. The

radio spot and trip were initiated by Mr, Gerald Darrell, who

runs the Compons.
\RA Slate

funded by

The advertisements and bus charter were

Food Services.

Ouite a few underclassmen wanted to see the game but had

no means of transportation. Darrell saw the problem, and being

an ardent supporter of W&L athletics, he provided a solution

It is

effort for W&!l

rare for an individual to go to such lengths of personal

Llowever, this kind of personal effort has been

characteristic of Darrell in his stay in Lexington, Nobody made

him arrange for the bus or the advertisements

LETTER POLICY

The Ring-tum Phi encourages let-

typed and signed. In order to appear

to The Ring-tum Phi office in Reid

and libel.

Hinely Replies
Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

For the enlightenment of Mr.
Woodley and anyone whose “other-
wise quite reasonable” mind read
and believed what he said in his
letter of last week, | must say that
1 did NOT equate the Soviet gov-
ernment with the Roman Catholic
Church. I merely drew a PARAL-
LEL, which I still hold as valid, and
which is quite different in nature
from an overall “equation.” | would
refule the statement that the
Soviet government is the “vilest and
most obscene regime ever to crush
the humanity from a whole people.”
| would cite instead as the winner of
this dubious distinction an arm of
the Roman Catholic Church which
existed during the Middle Ages and
nio the Renaissance which was
known as the Inquisition, At least
the Soviets do not use the false pre
tense of being on the side of God in
their brutal secret police activitives
In the USSR, the defendant-victim
is only accused of crimes against the
state and thus the people rather than
crimes against the Church and thus
supposediy against God. The Soviets
do not find it necessary to cower be
hind a cloak of holiness to get rid
of those whom they do not like
They do not prevert religion to their
own ends; they merely suppress it in
general

in the audience:

Personal wealth becomes

Last but not least, let me refer the

Track Coverage

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

As a member of the WAL track
team, | am somewhat bothered by
the manner in which you reported
the results of the CAC track meet
It is true that we were a disgusting
last, but you are ignoring some very
fine performances. You made the
statement in your article, “Mike
Carrere gave WAL its best showing
in track with a third in the javelin.”
But what about Bob Sherwood's
third in the mile and Steve Haugh
ney’s third in the 880

Believe it or not, the track team
is still alive and is trying. It may be
very strong in about two years. For
instance, we have recruited or have

from tTexas, and a 10.0 100 yard

Members of the “Total Theatre”
class have worked this short term to
construct a room using the stage
floor and platforms over the audi-
torium to create the environment in
which the play’s action occurs. The
audience will witness “The Lower
Depths” within those surroundings
as well, lending a greater immediacy
and realism to their final production
of the season.

Seating for the audience is limit-
ed, however, and reservations for
the play should be made well in ad-
vance of its May 21-28 perform-
ances.

The action of “The Lower Depths”
takes place in the basement of a
lodging house in Russia at the turn
of the century. Inhabitants of the
house are of the class of people in
Russia known as “bosyak,” or “bare-

of society who worked at part-time
jobs or stole in order to live. These

BY MARC SMALL

rhe recent ruling by the Justice
Department on the invalidity of Vir-
ginia’s Assembly and House of Rep-
resentatives redistricting plans raises
a plenitude of questions, What right
does the Federal government have
to so blatantly interfere in a state
matter? Why should the American
people tolerate this gross violation
of separation of powers? What—if
any—benefits are to be accrued by
such an unusual structure?

The excuse given for the Voting
Rights Act of 1965 is simple: eleven
southern states have allowed discri-
minatory policies to be used in dis-
tricting plans in the past, and these
states can no longer be trusted to
develop racially unbalanced plans
without Federal supervision. Yet,

an idea is due to the inherent am-
biguity of the means by which it is
expressed—words. For what defini-
tion is not experience dependent and
in fact, basis for essay.

Perhaps lack of speed in some is
due to lack of relatable experience
or is concomitant with increased
perception. Is not speed a virtue of
our supersonic culture? If it is, then
the reasons for its association with
intelligence may be undestandable,
but are they justifiable?

] am not aware of research on the
subject, but it has been my experi-
ence that there are people who are
slowly brilliant who because of the
nature of the testing system which
assumes speed to be a manifestation
of intelligence, are not duly credited.

values, representative of the whole
of society in Russia.

In the basement are the whores,
drunkards, fallen aristocracy, thieves,
foreigners, tramps and _ diseased
which form the classes of Gorky’s
permanently closed society. The ac-
tion in the play moves much like a
musical composition, having a four-
act structure similar to a symphony’s
four movements. There are outbursts
of anger, moments of silence and
brief moments of song and laughter.

But it is the strikingly different
characters which make “The Lower
Depths” come alive in its environ-
mental surroundings. Their struggles
in this closed environment provide
at once a “slice of life” in Tzarist
Russia and a living conflict between
two philosophies of life in that base-
ment.

Depths” are limited, seats may be

we have a precept in our laws that a
criminal’s prior record should not be
present in testimony ‘before a court
of law; why then should this precept
be allowed to lapse in the case of
states? Why indeed? Perhaps poli-
tics Was more important in the pass-
age of the Act for by its passage the
Federal government—Democratic in
1965—had a means of controlling
insurgent Democratic movements
and supporting rebel party factions
subservient to the national organi-
zation. However, now that the Exe-
cutive has switched hands, the poli-
tical pragmatism of yesteryear disap-
pears, and we see a Republican At-
torney General vetoing a plan which
gerrymandered districts to the detri-
ment of the growing Republican
Party in Virginia. There can be no
excuse for the Congress to so sanc-
timoniously justify political pragma-
tism with moral arguments, yet hu-
man nature being what it is, we can
expect no better.

Fhe American people have be-
come tremendously concerned in the
past ten years with Civil Rights,
yet it is a concern that manifests
itself more by discriminatory acts
than by positive and constructive ac
tion. Instead of requiring all states
—and there is beyond question a
great measure of de facto segrega-
tion in all states—to register dis-
iricting plans with the Justice De
partment and to thus make more
palatable a stillameonstitutional ac-
tion, the Congress has passed legisla-
tion with wide popular approval
which makes a scape-goat out of one
section of the country and attempts
to foster on them the blame for all
racial discrimination.

It is undeniable that the South
has been a land of bigotry and sup
pression of blacks. However, such

do nothing wrong as they ravished
the slow Blue Devils defense with a
consistent dominance of face-offs
and turnovers. The clumsy Duke at-
tackmen relinquished many of their
goal opportunities on turnovers
caused by excellent checking from
Bill Brumback, John Rogers, and
Ed Tognetti. Freshman Ted Bauer
initiated the Blue Devil freshman
goalie by scoring an unassisted goal
with 13:07 remaining in the first
quarter. Bob Brumback and Hank
Slauson added unassisted goals dur-
ing the period to give the Generals a
3-0 lead.

A cold drizzle began to fall at the
second quarter opening but the Gen-
eral stickmen remained hot. Fresh-
man Skip Lichtfuss, who displayed
some excellent attack maneuvers
scored unassisted at 13:17. Only 16
seconds later, Hank Slauson scored
on an assist by Lichtfuss.

The then 5-0 lead seemed an adequ-
ate cushion to win, But goals by
Slauson, Whit Morrill, “Piggy” Mec-
Cane, and two by Chip Tompkins
vaulted the score to 10-0 at the half.

The wet field slowed the action in
the third quarter. “Piggy” McCane
notched his second goal at 9:29 on
an assist by Scott Neese. Neese turn-
ed around three minutes later and
converted on an assist by Lichtfuss
to give the Generals a 12-0 lead.

Almost 30 seconds after Sam En-
glehart scored, Duke tallied their
first goal on a freak ricochet off two
WAL defensemen to end the quarter
at a lopsided 13-1.

Englehart scored his second goal
with 13:16 left in the fourth quarter
on an assist by Slauson. The Blue
Devils mustered a steady attack at
the W&L goal for several minutes
and converted their final goal at
8:18. Englehart’s third goal, on an
assist by Bauer, and Rick Stieff’s
goal in the last two minutes ended
the scoring at 16-2.

On Intelligence

(Continued from page 2)

An expression of one man’s
thoughts have meaning to another
person only in the context of his
perception of them, feebly transmut-
ed through the medium of language.
Because expression does not have
existence beyond the expression ex-
cept within the sum of the recipient's
mind, whatever that may be, it seems
unlikely that speed of comprehen-
sion necessarily is an indication of
the recipient’s understanding of the
expression,

Clearly, this is not true in all
cases, but there must be some minds,
which due to nonsimilarity of experi-
ence with the exponent of an idea,
cultural biases, vocabulary gaps or a
precondition to perceive many par-
tial aspects of an idea before the
total idea is “comprehended,” are
tagged slower, but are not less in-
telligently responding. Because this
assumption, that speed is an index of
intelligence is so prevalent in our
system of student evaluation, yet

may be a false one, it should be’

questioned.

than bring an increase in the prob-
lem they were intended to end.
There is a measure of hypocrisy
in all this: the South, with a tradi-
tion of unconstitutional yet de jure
segregation, penalized and forced to
submit to the supervision of the
Federal government, while the
North, with its tradition of covert
and de facto segregation, is allowed
to continue its policies. Why should
the South be penalized for its hon-
esty? There are many things the
Federal government can do to in-
crease Civil Rights, but not—for the
sake of our Constitution—should it
adopt the Marxist view of the means
being more inyportant than the end!

In November the W&L debaters

“We plan to participate in more

Bradshaw. “We had eight pretty ac-

Bradshaw said that a concerted ef-

Civic Group Views Problems
Of Community Ties

(Continued from page 1)
Glenn Azuma, vice-president elect
of the Student Body.

The purpose of the meeting was to
open new lines of discussion between
student and civic leaders. Specific
complaints explored in this first
meeting included the recent contro-
versy concerning taxes on the W&L
student body in the form of license
tags and parking meters, and a
feeling among Lexington residents
that students act as if they were “at
the beach” when they are downtown.

Both groups of representatives
agreed that The Ring-tum Phi has

found there. Students may indulge in
“Monopoly,” “Scrabble,” “Milles
Bornes,” and other games—with in-
structions, game ‘boards, playing
cards, and all conversation § in

In order to receive the French
point of view on topics disoussed in
“expression orale” and the “Confer-
ence de Presse,” as well as to help
the students with their pronunciation
and intonation, most of the classes
are attended by Francois Bloc. M.
Bloc is a “Parisien” and is presently
assisting Dr. Brockman to produce
a textbook on French culture and
civilization. He is extremely inter-
esting to listen to; his views are ex-
ceptionally knowledgable with re-
spect to past and current interna-
tional affairs, with a strong leaning
in the direction of French infallibil-
ity.

If one is able to overcome the
frustration of trying to communi-

 

 

caused a great deal of confusion
among both students and city resi-
dents by inacourate reporting. A
plan by fraternities at the beginning
of the year to consolidate their food
buying was effectively scuttled when
Ring-tum Phi coverage hinted that
the fraternities were out to bovcott
certain Lexington merchants. Since
The Ring-tum Phi is the only source
of city news for students as well as
the only student news for city resi-
dents, it was felt that a lack of ac-
curate reporting on its part could
cause nothing but ill will between
the two segments of the community.

Cold check problems were also
discussed at the meeting, and it was
noted that this year’s bad ohecks
have already surpassed $1600, com-
pared with slightly more than $600
for all of last year. The increase,
agreed the representatives, has caus-
ed growing distrust of students
among local merchants. Both groups
said that students should realize that
merchants were doing them a service
by accepting their checks. It was
also noted that the 1970 Virginia
General Assembly passed a law
making the passage of bad checks
for amounts less than $100 a mis-
demeanor, and so students could be
prosecuted, instead of merely fined
by the Cold Check Committee.

The meetings will be continued
throughout the next school year in
hopes of creating a forum where
student and community complaints
can be aired before they develop
into major disputes,

Yearbooks Have Arrived

With the appearance this week of
the 1971 “Calyx” its editor, John
McCardell, announced that the year-
book has been dedicated jointly to
Professor Charles P. Light, former
dean of the School of Law; Dr.
Henry S. Roberts, head of the de-
partment of biology; and William
McC, Schildt, associate dean of stu-
dents and freshman coordinator.

The 1971 “Calyx” is now being
distributed in the Calyx office up-
stairs in the Student Center. Students
may receive their copies from 10:30
am. until 4:30 p.m. on Thursday
or Friday.

book is dedicated represent each of
the three major divisions of the uni-

versity Dean Light, the Law

in which he teaches business law in
addition to his administrative tasks.

With “change” as the theme of
this year’s annual, all three faculty
members, according to McCardell,
represent “the spirit of a changing
university within a heritage of mean-
ingful tradition.”

Among innovations inchided in
this year’s volume were an interview
format to present those to whom the
book is dedicated as well as a merg-
ing of the senior section and the
faculty section, grouped by depart-
mental majors. McCardell stated so
far student reaction to the book has
been mixed, “But over all it seems
to be quite favorable..”

The “Calyx” describes Dean Light
as “a patient and understanding
counselor, a beloved and respected
teacher, a gentleman and a friend.”
After retiring as dean in 1967—after
more than forty year’s previous
service on the W&L faculty—he re-
turned as dean for a year when his
successor, Robert E. R. Huntley, was
elected president of the university
Dean Light continues to teach full-
time courses in constitutional law,
torts, and federal law.

Dr. Roberts, former chairman of
the conmemittee which oversaw the
most comprehensive updating in the
university's curriculum in decades, is
praised for having been “instru
mental in the changes,” a man “who
worked tirelessly to revise and mod
ernize the course of study and who
successfully championed so progres

 

Warm spring weather and a lack of parking places have encouraged many

sive a measure to make Washington
and Lee an even better school.”

Dr. Roberts came to W&L in
1964 from Duke University, where
he had a member of the graduate
faculty in zoology.

Dean Schildt, a summa cum laude
law graduate of the university, is
characterized as “a dynamic indi-
vidual (who) impresses everyone he
meets with his sincerity and con-
viction, He possesses all the quali-
ties that an uncertain future de-
mands,” continues the dedication
text, “the qualities of a Washington
and Lee man, not unmindful of the
future.”

McCardell expressed special
thanks to Assistant Editor Don
Marshall, photographers Pat Hinely
and Walt Bransford, and University-
Classes editor Joe Blake, “who were
always here and always willing to
accept any responsibilities and
tasks.”

“This is their book, as much as
it is mine,” McCardell said. Several
weeks ago the Publication Board
designated Marshall to be the editor
of the 1972 “Calyx.”

codification is possible. Clearly how-
ever, trust entails the absence of
suspicion, threat, and fear. It as-
sumes respect for persons and it
acknowledges honesty and trust-
worthiness as the prerequisites of
respect.

“It is our conviction that com-

lectual growth can ‘best occur. But
we recognize that such a community

Students Must
Register Cars

The Office of the Dean of Students
has announced that, beginning with
the next academic year, all student
cars must be registered with the
university. It was emphasized, how-
ever, that only those students who
wish access to W&L parking facili-
ties will be required to pay the
$15.00 parking fee.

Also the stipulation in this year’s
regulations prohibiting campus park-
ing for students living within a half-
mile radius of Washington Hall will
be eliminated. Since the administra-
tion anticipates increased parking
areas near the new Doremus Gym-
nasium and elsewhere, university
parking will be available to any stu-
dent, without regard to his resi-
dential proximity to campus.

“We are sorry that any restrictions
at all are necessary,” said Lewis G.
John, Dean of Students. “We recog-
nize the inconvenience caused to
students by the regulations, and we
hope we can add parking spaces and
areas to alleviate this problem.”

Four stickers will be distributed
for registration, each to identify
automobiles in the following cate-
gories: (1) those owned by faculty,
staff, and dormitory counselors, who
may park in special areas behind
the campus—no fee, (2) those owned
by upperclassmen, who will use stu-
dent-designated parking areas—$15
fee, (3) those owned by freshmen,
who must use the Liberty Hall park-
ing facilities only—$15 fee, and (4)
those owned by students who do not
wish to use university parking—no
fee.

Registration, as usual, will take
place in the matriculation line in
September. The administration hopes
that parking areas may be added
next year below the Doremus Gym-
nasium addition and also expects
that the lot in front of the gym will
be more fully used.

“The parking problem this year
has worked out better than we had
anticipated,” John continued. “There
was a rash of violations at the very
beginning of the spring term, but
overall we have found the students
to be very cooperative.”

Most of the violations tallied by
the university Proctor this year have
concerned students parking in the
faculty and staff areas behind the
campus. Dean John explained that
the purpose for having all student
cars under university registration was
to help identify violators and to aid
university officials in their statistical
analyses and vehicle studies.

 

those who build it. The successful
building of a trusting community
requires initially that every member
devote himself unswervingly and
totally to being always and in every-
thing worthy of being trusted.
Simultaneously it requires that he
accept others as people he can and
will trust.

 

The President of the Student
Body and the President-elect have
told me of the statement which
the two Executive Committees
have made about the honor sys-
tem. The subject has received
their most careful and deliberate
thought. From my own personal
experience and observation over
a time which spans two and a
half decades at Washington and
Lee, I know without doubt that
the single most valuable experi-
ence which a student here may
have is the experience of living
in a community characterized by
mutual trust. It may be that such
an atmosphere of trust and honor
is rarer in the world today than
ever before; if so, it is even more
to be cherished and coveted
among us here.

The joint Executive Commit-
tees have succinctly expressed the
basic premise on which our honor
system rests. I share and endorse
their commitment to that premise.

R. E. R. Huntley

 

 

 

“In full confidence that Honor,
conceived as mutual trust, will bear
the closest scrutiny and demand the
fullest measure of devotion we
commend this way of life once more
to the entire University community
for re-examination and recommit-
ment.”

Each EC passed this proposal
unanimously with little discussion.

This year’s EC officially recogniz-
ed the Student Association for Black
Unity. This means that the group
can use the facilities of the Univer-
sity Center.

A report was presented by Mark

McMinn, chairman of the Film
Committee. McMinn summarized
the activities of his committee

throughout the year. He said about
$200 was left over from their alloted
funds. He encouraged that these
surplus funds be spent in acquiring
a new projector. Currently, the
group utilizes a projector owned by
the Art Department. The EC approv-
ed this allocation.

Joe Tompkins said the Student
Financial Relations Committee an-
ticipated about a $500 surplus this
year after the fines are collected.
He moved that chairman Henry
Harkey and next year’s chairman
Chuck Lee be allowed to donate
about $200 to some worthwhile com-
munity project. This motion passed
unanimously.

Once the 1970-71 EC adjourned
the 1971-72 EC held a brief session.
The Honor System proposal was
passed as the first order of business.

National Humanities Gift
Sponsors Library Course

“A more complete understanding
of the library and how to use it is
essential,” according to W&L’s head
librarian, Maurice D. Leach. And
with this purpose in mind Mr,
Leach will direct a program next
year designed to increase faculty and
student familiarity with the scope of
resources in the university's under-
graduate library system. The five-
year project will be funded through
a $50,000 grant made jointly by the
National Endowment for the Hu-
manities and the Council on Library
Resources.

President Huntley announced last
week that the program, expected to
begin July 1, will aim to include
faculty and students in the total
project, to help make the university
community more knowledgeable as
to the varied uses of the main Me-
Cormick Library as well as the
separate collections in six under-
graduate departments.

Dr. Linton L, Barrett, professor
of Romance languages, has been
named reference coordinator of the
program. He plans to devote half
of his professional time to the de-
velopment and execution of the plan
over the next five years,

The program will emphasize the

library system's reference services,

the relative strengths and flaws with
in the departmental collections, and
also the methods by which students
may make the most effective use of
both on-campus resources and those

students and faculty members to ride bicycles and motocycles to school.

of the inter-library loan service.

During the first stages of the
program, only selected academic
departments in the undergraduate
College will be involved. Each
participating department will select
a liason professor who will teach
an intensive bibliographical course
dealing specifically with library re-
sources available in the department's
field.

During the second year, that of
academic year 1972-1973, two stu-
dents will be incorporated into the
project. By 1976 there will be eight
additional student participants.

Mr. Leach pointed out that with
an increasing importance being plac-
ed on independent study, particularly
during the spring term, the library
program could be especially valu-
able. Evenwally, it is hoped, the
program may become a permanent
system designed to familiarize every
student with the latent resources of
the library facilities,

The new program accompanies a
recently increasing emphasis on the
imporiance of the WAL library to
the university. Since 1965 the pro-
portion of library expenditures per
student has increased nearly 400
percent, and since 1967 the library
budget has almost tripled. Present
holdings include more than 300,000
publications and the adminisiration
is preparing plans for the construc-
tion of a new library plant in future
years

 
 

 

 

 

2 THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

May 206, 1971

Exams start Monday. And not long after their completion
come “the great equalizers.” That is to say grades. The grad-
ing system seems as firmly entrenched at W&L as white
columns and red brick, The only major modification of that
code in recent years was the introduction of the Pass-Fail
option.

Under this system a student receives no letter grade at
all. Instead the individual fulfills the necessary work for the
course and passes or, on the other hand, fails.

This innovation has been well received by students. Cur-
rently any student with sophomore standing can enroll in
one Pass-Fail course each term. In the academic year of
1967-1968, when the new plan was initially offered, a total
of 147 courses was taken on this basis. A year later the
total climbed to 244, Last year 343 courses were taken on a
Pass-Fail basis. This year 436 men utilized this opportunity.
According to Registrar Harold Head, next year’s student
body plans to enroll in even more courses Pass-Fail. The trend
seems evident: W&L students are taking more and more
Pass-Fail courses. The purpose of mentioning these facts is
two-fold, First, we believe that Washington and Lee benefitted
from this modification in the grading format. Second, we
contend that further study of alterations could result in
greater benefits to W&L.

Grades do serve a purpose. Graduate schools need a scale
to evaluate undergraduates. Grades are that scale. Also,
Washington and Lee uses grades to study the kind of teach-
ing job it is doing compared with other institutions or possibly
compared with previous students at W&L. Many employers
look at grades before they hire employees in order to guage
work accomplishment for the future.

Keeping these scaling purposes in mind, is it possible that
our university might establish another scale? Such an alternate
system might incorporate Graduate Record Examinations,
Achievement Tests or Aptitude Tests. Such an approach would
still provide the quantitative data required for evaluation and
comparison.

Hollins College requires its students to take the GRE’s
The W&L Politics Department tried a similar approach this
spring. The department paid for the tests and all graduating
majors were requested to take the test. Hopes are high that
the results will give the faculty some idea of the quality of
education a W&L man is receiving in political science.

A system of universal testing would have some inherent
draw-backs. Some students do not test well, they get too
nervous and tense for these kinds of evaluations. The tests do
not give a fair indication of the ability of those individuals.
Such a program of mass attendance at GRE’s would mean
more time and cost for the school. This alternative to grades
has some obvious flaws as we have shown.

Perhaps grades could be simply de-emphasized. The idea
of avoiding a particular course because of a record of cor-
responding poor grades is saddening in our academic com-
munity. Even more discouraging is the exodus of students to
courses with reputations for easy grades, The emphasis seems
to be on grades not the teaching and learning process.

But what can be done to improve the grading system at

W&L?

One preliminary solution might be eliminating the grade
F in the undergraduate courses. This doctrine may seem like
a pleasant dream to many undergraduates. Yet, a faculty
member, Dr. E, L. Pinney, has proposed discussion of this
plan before the University Council. The idea is to be dis-
cussed in the council's next session.

According to Dr, Pinney, Randolph-Macon Woman's Col-
lege has accomplished such a goal. They use a 3.0 scale under
which a student is not penalized for a failure, Dr. Pinney
explained that the grade F accomplishes two goals—it evalu-
ates a student's work and it penalizes him, Pinney disagreed
with the penalty that an undergraduate receives for failing
a course,

Still another solution would be widely expanding the Pass-
Fail option. Under existing academic requirements no required
courses can be taken in major fields Pass-Fail. Also cognates
and distribution courses are not accepted unless they are
taken for a grade. Some of these restrictions might be removed.

In closing it should be explained why change is needed in
reference to grades, Grades are often unfair, Grades vary from
department to department and from professor to professor.
In defense of the administration a guideline has been estab-
lished for grades. “A” work is termed exceptional, “B" work
is good and so on, However, this guideline is interpreted
differently by different teachers and the results are great
inequities,

We do not endorse a percentage plan for grades. The flunk
out quotas imposed at some overcrowded state schools need
not be applied to our university, Our school is unique in its
ability to freely evolve solutions to new problems, This prob-
lem of grades is over-shadowing the genuine academic interests
of W&L, No clear solution is evident. Yet, now is the time
to re-evaluate the importance and effects of grades at W&l

Short Spring Term Evaluated

By HAGOOD ELLISON

With less than one week left in
the school year, faculty members
and students are looking back on the
newly-innovated Spring term with
surprising optimism.

The change from the old two-
semester system to a more flexible
12-12-6 has been a smooth one.
Dean of Students Lewis John called
the overall transition a “good one,”
with “more \positive than negative
results in the first year.” John sees
the change as ‘being beneficial, not
only for the students but the whole
University as well.

The key and impetus for the
Spring term was, and still is, indi-
vidual directed study. This point was
borne out by Student Body Presi-
dent Steve Robinson, who saw the
mini-semester as a chance for stu-
dents to get into a subject with
greater depth. If anything, it has
opened the doors of hard-line re-
strictions and has granted students
a better opportunity for self-discip-
line in fields of individual study.

Roger Munsick, Ohairman of the
Student Curriculum Committee, felt
that this term has given each person
a chance for individuality by com-
mitment to what one is interested
in. Especially Munsick noted the
Total Theatre and French Emersion
courses which required “total de-
votion by the individual.” The term
has also given many students the
chance for work away from the Uni-
versity during the regular school
year. Foreign Language students are
now in France, Germany, and Spain,
while Biology, Journalism, and
Politics students have been able to
study away from campus too.

The “Short term” as it has been
called, has not ‘been without its
faults. Dr. John Devogt, newly elect-
ed Chairman of the Faculty Cur-
riculum Committee, felt that some
students had viewed the term from
the beginning as a vacation, and
that because of a poor job of “sell-
ing it” to the students, the full ad-
vantages were not utilized, Devogt
went on to add that the adaptation
of regular one-semester courses to
a summer-school framework has not
been entirely satisfactory.

Like others, he anticipates a re-
vamping of courses crammed into

By MONTY COTTIER

“Winter in the Shenandoah Val-
ley,” begins an essay much admired
by yours truly, “is a cold, wet, and
dreary proposition.” Much in the
same vein is the perennial observa-
tion that “I don’t know whether
spring in Lexington is really nice,
or if it just seems that way because
the winters are so horrible.” Every-
one usually looks at the author of
this observation, and there is gen-
eral, although exceedingly moderate,
laughter.

Well, that time of year has rolled
around and, in order to bring this
whole thing to a conclusion once
and for all, we here at “The Phi (as
we call it; we understand that many
of our classmates have other names
for it)’ have decided to give the
thing a cursory (no, that doesn’t
mean what you think it does, and,
anyway. stop asking questions)
examination.

Our basic premise (and what's
ours is yours, . . . you know that)
is that the months of April, May,
and whatever of June must be en-
dured before we escape are, in and
of themselves, enjoyable, without
the added comparison with the pre-
ceeding Decenvber, January and
February (you may note that we have
left out March, This is intentional,
as We are not at all sure that there
is supposed to be a March, and any-
way its usually too wet to do any
thing with)

“Why.” we are often asked, “do
people seem {0 enjoy spring so
much?” Now, these questions always
confuse us just a bit, since this is
actually supposed to be the billing
office for Virginia Power & Electric
Co., but we try to do our best, any-
way

To begin, then, spring in this gen
eral neighborhood has numerous ad-
vantages to recommend il, some of
which will have to come to mind
if this thing is ever going to get
written. Oh, yeah
of them now

1. At this time of year, the trees

Here are some

What is in the future for the
Spring term? The calendar for 1971-
72 is set, so it will be with us at
least one more year, The Faculty
Curriculum Committee will prob-
ably begin evaluation of it next fall
in time for the ’73 calendar, Students

can feel safe that we will not return
to the previous two-semster system.
The long stretch from January to
April still seems to be filled with
the mid-winter apathy, and certainly
the Faculty will take a long look at
putting the short term there.

Regardless of some problems, the
Spring Term has ‘been a fresh break
from the past, has opened the fields
of individual research and study
for nearly all students, and may pave
the way toward a fuller, more ex-
panded curriculum,

‘Don’t you know what the Spring Term’s about?’

all over campus are covered with
broad, flat things which Dr. Nye
of the Botany Department assures
me are known in academic circles
as “leaves,” and which, at night, so
filter out the lighting (what there is
of it) on campus that those little
cracks on the sidewalks, which look
quaint enough in the daylight, take
on a sinister aspect, the likes of
which have not been seen since they
took Jack the Ripper’s scalpel away
from him. (Hint: Kneecaps removed
without the aid of an aneshetic are
no fun.)

2. For those who feel that winters
around here are too quiet, spring
brings the peripheral gratification of
lawn mowers, painters, and people
scaling the buildings trying to re-
move the winter's accumulation of
leaves, twigs, grade reports and
abortive term papers from the rain
spouts.

3. Spring, for some reason, brings
out the worst in the local wildlife
(references and unwarranted puns
concerning Estelle’s Grill and the
ABC store will be studiously avoid-
ed). Several of the larger chipmunks
and squirrels emerge from the
winter's hiding with malice in their
eyes, and begin fighting some of the

SABU Intent

To the Editor:

Here are the purposes and goals
of the Student Association for Black
Unity.

We, the Black students of Wash-
ington and Lee University, believe
that the time is ripe for us to come
together as an organization for the
purposes of benefitting the School,
the white as well as the Black stu-
dents. We do not advocate a
separate but equal student body.
Our sole purpose is to become an
interwoven part of the student body.
We feel that we can benefit both
ourselves and the “white” student
body if we come together as a group
with one major purpose and goal
which encompasses all minor pur-
poses and goals.

We feel that our feelings cannot
be felt nor can our needs ‘be known
if the identity and social customs
which we possess cannot conform
and assimilate with that of the white
students, We support this fact by
showing that the administration of
this school is blind and ignorant
of the needs of the blacks who are
presently enrolled. It cannot be said
that the administration is totally to
blame. This is a new and unique
experience for this school.

We believe that if black students
are to be incorporated into this
school, then they should not be so
diffused and absorbed that they do
not offer anything of value to the
school nor to the Black community
in years to come. To prevent this,
we feel that this organization will be
of rewarding value.

Another primary goal is to see
that the future blacks will be accli-
mated here at Washington and Lee.
We believe that the administration
as well as the blacks can benefit if
the administration is informed about
“Blackness” from our point of view.

Moreover, it is our intention to
make this white student body aware
of the fact that we do have some-
thing that is important and of great
value to this University. We are of
the opinion that a Black Culwre
Program is much needed on this
campus. There is a need to make
these students realize the great con-
tribution that Blacks have made to
this great country. We intend to
sponsor other programs along these
same lines throughout the year.
These programs will help to curtail
the wide gap in the lack of under-
standing between the black and
white sudents. The promulgation of
our ‘beliefs, ideas and customs will
be very educational to the entire
school.

Our goal is to let it be known,
as much as possible, that this Uni-
versity must be committed to what
“ought to be” in this society as well
as what “is.” It must not be con-
cerned with the giving of knowledge
itself ‘but also with the utility of
knowledge. This is why the Uni-
versity and the blacks should con-
ceive of themselves as servants of
each other.

Johnny Edward Morrison, ‘74

Thanks from SBA
fo The Editor:

On behalf of the Student Bar
Association of the Law School, |
wish to thank the Editor and staff
of The Ring-tum Phi for their com-
prehensive coverage of Law School
events over the past year. The effect
of this excellent reporting has been
to more fully integrate the diverse
interests of the total University com-
munity,

It is the intention of the Student
Bar Association to more fully par-
ticipate in University-wide activities
in the coming year, and the efforts
of The Ring-tum Phi in reporting
the activities of all groups of our
University has helped to foster with-
in the Law School a growing aware-
ness of and attachment to Washing-
ton and Lee University rather than
the Washington and Lee Law School.

No Thanks—WLUR

Dear Sir:

Concerning the “Word of Thanks

believe you have omitted two people
who should also have been men-
tioned in connection with that “un-
usual advertisement.” Two WLUR
staff members, Mr. Lou Rieder and
Mr. Kirkpatrick, put a large effort
into the production of those an-
nouncements. Two announcements
were produced, to be aired on two
different days. The spots were indeed
professionally done, and reflect the
effort put into them, In fact, these
two gentlemen were working on
them until 3:30 am. on the day

LaRue’s Press Box

Lacrosse, Belmont and Indy

Washington and Lee’s lacrosse
image was certainly not harmed by
the events of the past weekend in
the national playoffs. Saturday, Navy
which edged the Generals 10-8,
knocked off top-ranked Virginia.
In other action Maryland slaughter-
ed Air Force, Army crushed Hofstra,
and Cornell nipped Brown in an
all-Ivy battle.

In the semi-finals, Navy meets
Maryland in a ‘battle of state powers,
while Army takes on Cornell. From
here, it looks like Navy will knock
off Maryland and that Army will
best Cornell. Finally, an Army-Navy
match of championship calibre.

Will Canonero Il become the first
horse since Citation to win the
rriple Crown? Tune in June 5 for
the Belmont Stakes. The odds are
against the Latin American entry
which has already claimed the Ken-
tucky Derby and the Preakness, as
only two favorites have successfully
finished as predicted on this mile and
a half track.

And in another great race, the
Indy 500, which takes place May 29
the records are falling like flies,

 

which is not really new. Sunday was
the last chance to bump someone
out of the thirty-three car starting
line, but few of the entries listed
Saturday had anything to fear.

This year, the record run over the
two and a half mile course was
Peter Revson’s 178.7 mph _ pace
which averaged 171.25 over ten
miles. That's up from last year’s
166.8 for those of you who eat
statistics,

Races seem to be the priority
this week. It was interesting to note
that Marty Liquori, perhaps with-
out the pressure of Jim Ryun to
stimulate him, turned in an atrocious
4:10.9 for the mile run at the El
Paso Invitational. A week earlier in
Philadelphia Liqouri beat Ryun with
a swift 3:54.6. In all fairness it
should be noted, however, that the
Texas winds rose to 45 mph last
weekend,

As a sidenote, a familiar name
won the shot put event at 66’ 5°—
Randy Matson.

And finally, a big thank you goes
out to all those who helped stage
yesterday's All-Sports Banquet,
which was a very good show.

Small Opposition

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

In a recent article in The Ring-
tum Phi, we were all subjected to
a lesson in Political Science by that
old master, Marc Small. Mr. Small
gave us a lecture in how to be biased
individuals while trying not to ap-
pear so. This is in conjunction with
a course that he is trying to insti-
tute: Political One-sidedness 101, In
his last lecture, Mr. Small used the
concepts of political persecution, in-
justices, appeals to sectionalism, and
a blatant distortion of point of view
in regards to an issue. He did so
in order to establish and set up a
particularly biased commentary on
the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

To deny the fundamental right
of voting to anyone is a terrible in-
justice, and serious threat to the well
being of this nation. Mr. Small
makes an even greater threat to the
well ‘being ‘by helping to retard
change. He does so by “knit-pick-
ing” about who is at fault, and
where the blame should be placed.
By doing so Mr. Small helps only
to perpetuate a system that has
denied the full attainment of politi-
cal rights, thereby prolonging in-
justice and increasing hostilities.

0 THe

 

and
them much worth at that. Is not this
country based on the premise that
everyone iis entitled to the vote, and
that if any particular individual who

value judgement, not giving

is justified to vote is denied that
right, then the system should be
amended?

Mr. Small, likes to complain about
the system, and complain about
changes to it that don’t conform to
his standards. He does so openly,
which is his right, but 1 wonder why
in his role as commentator he does
not suggest constructive alternatives?
I would much rather see him do this
as Opposed to asserting: “There are
many things the Federal Govern-
ment can do to increase Civil
Rights, ...” and theh not listing any-
thing!

The final thing that struck me as
strange about Mr. Small’s com-
mentary is his claim that the South
is being punished for it’s honesty. On
the contrary “professor” Small, if
the South is being punished at all,
it is for the “injustice,” that you
have admitted has existed in the
South. Also since | am a Black
man from the “South” I can attest
to the fact that it still does exist.

If this is the type of thinking that
is allowed to run rampant through
the pages of this paper, then I am
quite distressed at the prospects of
reading future issues of The Ring-
tum Phi.

Johnny L. White, ‘74

 

   
 

A responsible American sees be-
yond his own nose; it hurts me to
say that Mr. Small has not done
so in this instance. He also let the
readers of the Phi down by collaps-
ing into yellow journalism; with pas-
sages like “While it might cause
a quite minor increase in voting
rights among those eleven states, .. .”

Number 32

 

 

 

A total of 293 bachelor’s and law
degrees were conferred on 290 stu-
dents in commencement exercises at
Washington and Lee.

Following long-standing tradition,
President Robert E. R. Huntley was
the principal speaker and presented
diplomas to each new graduate in
the June 4 ceremonies on the historic
front campus of the University.

Huntley stated during his com-
mencement address that commence-

ment is a “time for looking forward
to the future, rather than back-
ward at the past.”

The President of the University
went on to comment, “It is now
quite clear that no one institution,
no matter how large or how wealthy,
can hope to provide the full range
of choice which our complex civili-
zation must have from its educa-
tional system, and therefore the new
patterns of educationa and new kinds

Farrar Calls Frosh

‘Strongest

The Class of 1975, a group of
incoming freshmen termed by Dean
of Admissions, James D. Farrar, as
“the strongest in recent years,” will
enroll at Washington and Lee in
September. Currently 357 men are
included in the class, a decrease
from the Class of 1974 that entered
the University in September, 1970.

Dean Farrar also noted, however,
that in contrast to a general down-
ward trend of applications to private
schools, the number of applicants
to WAL increased by ten to 1260.
Of these 1260, 800 were offered ad-
mission to Washington and Lee.
Thus 45 per cent of those accepted
chose to come, a decrease of 7 per
cent from last year.

Dean Farrar added that the geo-
graphical distribution of applicants
and actual entering freshmen re-
mained “about the same.” Forty
states will be represented with 20
per cent of the entering class com-
ing from Virginia.

Included in the Class of 1974
are 36 alumni sons. Twelve students
from the Rockbridge County area
are to enroll.

The University will provide $110.-
500 to freshmen through a wide
range of aid programs, according to
Dean William A. Noell Jr., Director
of Student Financial Aid. This is
again a slight decrease from a last
year. Dean Noell added that this
total includes scholarship, direct

Virginia Gov. Linwood Holion,
U.S. Ambassador to Sweden Jerome
D. Holland, Dr. Daniel Blain of
Philadelphia and Edwin Hyde of
Richmond received honorary degrees
today from Washington and Lee

President Robert E. R. Huntley
conferred the LL.D. degree on Gov
Holton, Dr. Holton and Mr. Hyde
and the D.Sc. degree on Dr. Blain
during commencement exercises on
the university's front campus. Al-
most 300 students received bachelor’s
and law degrees during the cere-
monies.

A 1944 graduate of Washington
and Lee, Holton became in 1969 the
first Republican elected governor of
Virginia since Reconsiruction. Long
active in Republican party politics,
he first ran for governor in 1965,
and was one of Richard Nixon's
earliest and most ardent supporters
in the 1968 Presidential campaign.

After naval service in World War

of the patterns that now exist but
in addition to them.

“Washington and Lee, in the
future as in the past, will not be
afraid of change. Even in the few
years since you graduating seniors
enrolled, significant changes in cur-
riculum, in student life, and in
methods of governance have been
fashioned with care and undertaken
with confidence. Such changes will
continue to occur and will continue
to be consistent with the basic edu-
cational objectives and ideals of the
school.

 

“In short, then, I believe that
Washington and Lee’s future, ac-
companied by the hard work and
devotion which has been so much a
part of its past, can and will be
a full one, a successful one, a rele-
vant one. The mission is one of
which we can be proud and which
deserves and will receive our fullest
efforts.”

Washington and Lee Receives $600,000 Grant

A $600,000 grant has been given
to Washington and Lee University by
the William R. Kenan Jr. Charitable
Trust to establish an endowed pro-
fessorship.

Dr. William A. Jenks, head of the
history department and a prominent
authority on modern Austria and
the Habsburg dynasty, has been
named Washington and Lee’s Kenan
professor, University President R.
E. R. Huntley said.

Both announcements came in
Huntley's address during commence-
ment exercises at Washington and
Lee.

In announcing Dr. Jenks’ appiont-
ment to the Kenan chair, Huntley
said the trust wishes “to support a
scholar-teacher of distinction, whose
enthusiasm for learning, commit-

ler and Glenn. He has been a direc-
tor of Roanoke's Fine Arts Center,
vice-president of the Virginia Bar
Association, and president of the
Roanoke chapter of Washington and
Lee's Alumni Association.

In 1960 and again in 1968 he
served as a Virginia delegate to the
national GOP nominating conven-
tions, and served as regional co-
ordinator in President Nixon's 1968
campaign.

Dr. Blain, director of the Penn
sylvania State Hospital in Phila
delphia, professor of psychiatry at
the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine and former
president of the American Psychi-
Association, is a fifth-genera-
tion Washington and Lee alumnus,
having earned the B.A. degree in
1921. His son, Daniel Blain, Ir.,
represented the sixth generation
when he graduated from the uni-
versity in 1963

Dr. Blain was born in Kashing
China, and following eraduation
from Washington and Lee took the

aire

ment to teaching, and interest in stu-
dents will make a notable contribu-
tion to the undergraduate com-
munity”—a reflection of Mr. Kenan’s
own intense interest in education.
“The Kenan grant,” Huntley said
in his address, “is an emphatic indi-
cation that intelligent and discern-
ing men, who owe no special al-
legiance to us, share our conviction
in the vitality of Washington and
Lee’s function as a small, high-
quality liberal arts teaching insti-
tution, and wish us to know that
our confidence has been justified.”

William Rand Kenan Jr., a native
of Wilmington, North Carolina, de-
voted a lifetime to the advancement
of higher education. He began his
career as a country school-teacher in

Gen. Lucius D. Clay. Gen, Clay told
the 27 graduates that the three
problems of discipline, race rela-
tions and drugs are perhaps the most
important challenges facing armed
services officers today, and a “people
oriented” means of attacking them
rather than a computer-style ap-
proach is essential.

The newly designated commander
of the U.S. Air Force in the Pacific

spoke to the cadets during the brief
commissioning ceremony. The Gen-
eral’s son, Lucius Clay III, was

Gen. Clay described today’s officer

cumstances—and I am proud of all
of them.”

2 THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK
Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Friday, June 4, 1971

 

For you soon-to-be freshmen this newspaper is probably
your first glimpse of Washington and Lee. Be forewarned!
A veritable barrage of information is on its way. Before you
succumb to this useless information, give us an opportunity
to answer the question which must be utmost in your minds—
what is W&L like?

Washington and Lee is best characterized by one word—
change. Change is evident across the campus. From a physical
perspective Doremus Gymnasium is gradually approaching
its completion. The new 12-12-6 curriculum, featuring a short
spring term, is being tried for the first time. Students are
enrolling in more and more courses on a Pass-Fail basis. An
increase in female exchange students is foreseen this autumn
at Washington and Lee.

Yes, all the above changes are evident in quantitative or
other concrete forms. But additional changes are better hidden
and more difficult to ascertain. W&L attitudes are changing:
attitudes towards Blacks, attitudes toward the Honor System,
attitudes about student involvement, attitudes about the re-
sponsibilities of Washington and Lee and attitudes about
tradition.

It would be a lie to say there is no racial discrimination
here. But a large contingent of Blacks are enrolled under the
auspices of a sizeable W&L scholarship fund for minority
groups. The Honor System has critics, and the honor court
has recently published a statement endorsing a change in
emphasis for honor cases. Yet, the Honor System in our estima-
tion is largely unique and it works, W&L students seem
growingly unsatisfied with dropping out of the world for four
years while they attend college. Today many men are becom-
ing involved in community projects and political campaigns.
Quite a few students no longer feel W&L is situated atop a
hill separated from themselves and the world. W&L is realiz-
ing its responsibilities to both its students and outsiders and
attempting to fulfill these responsibilities. Indeed, we would
by lying if we said coats and ties are worn to class at Wash-
ington and Lee. Students seem less and less attuned to the
conventional dress tradition. However, the strong sense of
other, more important traditions prevail despite change.

So, we advise you to withhold judgment of W&L for a
while, at least. You see, many entering students have found
Washington and Lee to be either a self-fulfilling dream or a
bitter disappointment. In other words your four year residency
here can be what you desire it to be.

Our campus might become a touchstone for your perpetual
roadtrips to Hollins, Randolph-Macon, Mary Baldwin or Sweet
Briar. And Washington and Lee can provide you with weekly
parties and plenty of drunken stupors. You are certainly able
to make your “gentleman's C’s” and graduate. The opportunity
is here to inner-tube (if we may invent a verb) your life away.

As valuable as those goals might appear, you can get a
bit more out of our institution. You can acquire a high quality
education. You can benefit from a close student-teacher rela-
tionship. You can learn to respect and possibly inherit several
traditions, such as the Honor System, which have been
characterstic of W&L men in the past. You can give of your
time and energy to make your new school a better school,
perhaps even the finest school.

Surely, Washington and Lee over the next few years can
be many things. But enough, returning to our original ques-
tion—what is W&L like—the reply seems clear. W&L can
be what you want it to be, Ponder that thought very carefully.

Greeting From the Presidents

You have probably heard much
about Washington and Lee by now
and have been confused by much
of it. You have probably been told
and have read that there are many
time-honored traditions at Washing-
ton and Lee.

However, the University is chang-
ing, and some of its traditions are
dying. Gone, for the most part is
conventional dress. Also rapidly dis-
appearing, and very regrettably so,
is the speaking tradition. One aspect
of Washington and Lee, however,
has not changed since the days of
Robert E, Lee. That is the Honor
System.

The Honor System, in my opinion,
is the most important single aspect
of Washington and Lee. You are
aware of other benefits of Wash-
ington and Lee I'm sure: the small
classes, excellent faculty, and the
ample opportunities for independent
study. Yet, without the Honor Syst-
tem, none of these conditions would
be here.

The Honor System is not a set
of laws or rules; rather it is a spirit
or atmosphere that dominates the
W&L campus. It is summarized in
the following statement: “A Wash-
ington and Lee student is to conduct
himself as a gentleman in matters
of honor at all times; he is trusted
and assumes the obligation to be
trustworthy.”

The life at Washington and Lee
is dominated by this pact of trust.
Students take unproctored _ tests,
schedule their own final examina-
tions, and can leave their rooms un-
locked without the fear that some-
one will come in and take some-
thing. As a member of the Wash-
ington and Lee community, you will
be expected to uphold and respect
this bond of trust. To do this you
are going to have to start thinking
about it now, and decide how you
feel about it. For it is only if one
is totally committed to the con-
cepts of honor and trust that he
can live and prosper at Washington
and Lee.

Welcome Frosh

No matter how hard one may try
to develop a new approach to the
expression of these welcoming re-
marks, it is difficult and perhaps
undesirable to abandon the fre-
quently recurring theme of mutual
expectations, Your entrance here is
characterized by many such shared
anticipations.

We, of course, cannot know pre-
cisely what your expectations are.
We have done everything possible to
provide the kinds of opportunities
we believe young men who have
elected to come to Washington and
Lee expect to have. Few institutions
combine as fully as this one the
advantages of smallness with a
breadth of curricular and extracur-
ricular offerings. Few offer the
chance for pursuit of the liberal
educational ideal of the whole man
while simultaneously affording you
an opportunity to involve yourself
deeply in areas of your particular
talent and interest.

Our pursuit of this ideal changes
with the times, but the ideal itself
remains constant.

Students here in many ways —
formal and informal — have a large
influence on our ways of deciding
things. You will hear more about
this kind of participation from your
student leaders and from the Dean
of Students.

In general, we expect of you an
intelligent individual pursuit of the
University’s educational ideal and a
thoughtful, responsible acceptance of
the large, and for many of you,
newly-found freedom to regulate
your personal lives. Above all, we
expect you to achieve the hallmarks
of the educated man — _ well-in-
formed judgment, a disciplined habit
of thought, lofty ideals, intellectual
honesty, humility, and tolerance.
Every resource of Washington and
Lee University is committeed to
helping you fulfill such purpose.

“Dr, Gerard Maurice Doyon

Chairman, the Art Department

Washington and Lee University.
Dear Dr, Doyon,

We have been extremely pleased
with Phil during the brief time he
has been with us, and we hope he
is an example of the high caliber
of students that we can expect from
Washington and Lee in the future,

William Gaines
The Virginia Museum of
Fine Arts”

“Phil” is Philip Beckwith, a senior
from Savannah, Ga. and the first art
major to work under the new Wash-
ington and Lee-Virginia Museum of
Fine Arts museum apprenticeship
program.

In the public note io Dr, Doyon,
the director of the apprenticeship
program in Richmond, William
Gaines, praised him for his work
during the Spring Term in Rich-
mond. In fact, the Virginia Museum
liked Beckwith's work so much that
they've given him a job,

Al a time when major news maga-
zines sich as “Time” proclaim that
this year’s graduating class will be

hard pressed to find jobs, Beckwith
has landed the job of curator of
the museum's new Arimobile on
African Art which will start its tour
of Virginia in September,

The Virginia Museum has just re-
ceived an indefinite, extended loan
on one of the nation’s outstanding
collections on the art of black
Africa. During the summer, Beck-
with will mount the show, and al
the end of a year's practical experi-
ence, he will be recommended for
further training in restoration and
preservation—probably al the Metro
politan Museum of Fine Arts in
New York.

In addition Beckwith's double ma
jor in art and geology should serve
him in work he plans to do in
Savannah, A sizeable section of old
Savannah is being restored al pres-
ent, and he hopes to have a hand
in that restoration in a few years.

He has also been at work on an
antique collection of furniture, the
product of jong searches through
Savannah attics. All he needs now
is to restore an old house as a home
for his furniture,

In behalf of the Interfraternity
Council, [| would like to extend con-
gratulations to all the members of
the Class of 1975 on your accept-
ance to Washington and Lee Uni-
versity and, at the same time, to
welcome you to our academic com-
munity. No doubt your decision to
choose W&L was a difficult one to
make, but it is just one of the
numerous decisions of importance
which you will encounter. Hopefully,
you will find Washington and Lee
to be the institution at which you
will best develop a personality, what-
ever its nature.

Part of that development for many
students at W&L has been fraternity
membership, Next fall, each one of
you will have the opportunity to
determine for yourself whether or
not fraternity life is for you; and
should your decision be affirmative,
you will have the task of choosing
which house is best suited to your
tempehments, talents, and convic-
tions. But during Rush, the Inter-
fraternity Council exists to help all
of you,

lems. Recently, the IFC established

That is a decision which only you

third choice.

When we come back in the fall,
the Presidential campaign will be
shifting out of low gear and picking
up speed; the various candidates will
probably command eight or nine
minutes a night on the network
news shows, so you know it’s im-
portant,

According to an old legend float-
ing around the campus, our Mock
Convention has a great deal of
impact on the national parties and
has a definite tendency to correctly
predict the future. The 1972 edition
of this crystal ball will take place
next spring under the able leader-
ship of Mr. Tom Gillespie; 1 wish
him the best of luck.

Since the old saying of “Once
a W&L man, always a W&L man”
holds so true, we can be assured of
a return appearance by Roger Mudd
and/or some of his colleagues, arm-
ed with cameras, lights, tape re-
corders, and such; we go big time.
Yes, hang around the convention
hall and you stand a good chance of
being on TV. Just remember to wear
a coat and tie.

As the first speaker trods slowly
to the elaborately bedecked podium,
the entire hall applauds as they
realize that the time until the
cocktail parties is growing ever
shorter, Reaching the platform, he
clears his throat and adjusts the
microphone, From the gallery issue
occasional coughs or laughs. I can
hear it now!

“Ladies and gentlemen... .. . wel-
come to the 1972 Mock Convention
of the National Democratic Party.
We are gathered here to select the
next President of the United States.”

Applause.

“In preparing for this gathering,
much planning and work has been
done to make it as realistic and truth-
ful as possible. In that spirit, our
National Committee came to the
following decision last night which
we now put before you:

“In light of the gaudy, artificial,
and basically useless purpose which
political conventions have acquired
since their inception during the nine-
teenth century, when they did indeed

Ecology Course Offers

Camping Out For Credit

By RITA ENNIS

Ecology: the relations between
living organisms and their environ-
ments. This is what Webster says,
but students in Biology 371 at W&L
could add much more to that de-
finition,

For them it has meant tents fall-
ing down, ashes in cooked-over-the-
fire food, sore bodies, wet and
smelly clothes and a much better
understanding of their environment

and its problems.

The course in called simply “Eco-
logy” and was offered in the newly-
created Spring Term this year.
Eleven students were enrolled (10
boys and one girl), and they, and
their professor, Dr. Tom Nye, spent
upwards of 24 hours per week in
class room and field activities. The
course has been offered in past
years, but the new short Spring
Term “offered the advantages of

better weather and more time for
field trips,” says Dr, Nye, “so we
switched.”

Students have taken extensive field
trips to West Virginia and Beaufort,
N.C. However, the main source of
field study comes from the local
area: the Blue Ridge Parkway, the
George Washington National Forest,
Cave Springs and North Mountain.

Major concentration for the course
has been placed upon simply under-

standing the features of different
systems of nature, but students have
also learned and observed first-hand
some of the effects of man’s pollution
upon those systems of nature.

The course has proven to be quite
popular among students. The class
was filled before Christmas and there
was a long waiting list. But because
of transportation and camping prob-
lems, the class size was restricted.

In addition to acquiring basic
knowledge, some of the students feel
they have benefited from the course
in other ways. One senior said, “To
be able to drink water from a moun-
tain stream is a great experience. The

Generals’ Athletic Teams
Round Out Sports Year

The 1970-71 intercollegiate sports
year at Washington and Lee is over;
and its success in many ways is
noteworthy. The compiled record of
the twelve intercollegiate sports in
which the Generals participated:
football, cross country, soccer, bas-
ketball, wrestling, swimming, base-
ball, lacrosse, golf, tennis, track, and
rifle; was 66-85-3. For a_ private
institution such as W&lL that has a
total undergraduate enrollment of
1200, offers no athletic scholarships,
and has 23 per cent of the student
body in varsity competition, such a
record is quite amazing.

W&L NCAA

competes, under

supervision, in college division
athletics as part of the College
Athletic Conference (CAC). Four
other universities comprise the con-
Southwestern at Memphis,
Sewanee, Washington University,
and Centre. Against these and other
colleges, the Generals had winning
seasons in four sports: cross country
(7-3), basketball (17-8), swimming
(5-4), and lacrosse (11-2). The round-
ballers, under the direction of coach
Verne Canfield, captured the CAC
championship, along with the swim
team, under Coach Sterns. It was
the twenty-fifth consecutive winning
year for the swimmers. The lacrosse

Generals Place
Five On Roster

Five Washingtun and Lee Univer-
sity lacrosse players have been
named All-American, including first
team selections Bill Brumback and
William (Sam) Englehart.

For Brumback, it was a repeat
performance. Recently voted W&L’s
most valuable athlete, the Baltimore
senior now has ended his collegiate
career by achieving All-America
status six times, four in swimming
and two in lacrosse.

Englehart, a sophomore from
Baltimore, led the Generals in scor-
ing for the past two years. His 45
goals and three assists this year
placed him among the nation’s
leaders.

Midfielder Whit Morrill was named
to the All-American second team.
The Monkton, Md. senior was a
third team choice last year.

Attackman Scott Neese of Ro-
chester, N.Y. and goal-keeper Bill
Ingersoll of Chestertown, Md. were
named on the honorable mention
list. Neese is a junior and Ingersoll
a senior.

All-Division

Five Washington and Lee Uni-
versity lacrosse players have been
chosen for the All-South Atlantic
Division team,

Defenseman Bill Brumback, at-
tackman Sam Englehart and mid-
fielders Skip Lichtfuss and Whit
Morrill were named to the first team.
All are from the Baltimore area.

Goal-keeper Bill Ingersoll of
Chestertown, Md. was named to
the second team.

W&L and Towson placed the most

with five apiece. Duke, North Caro-

ranked Cavaliers of Virginia and to
third ranked Navy.

Individual honors abound. In foot-
ball, despite a disappointing 2-7
record, quarterback Steve Fluharty
and receiver Steve Mahaffey made
honorable mention All-Americans in
the college division. Fluharty, a
junior next year, finished seventh in
passing in the nation, while Ma-
haffey, who graduated in January,
grabbed the number one spot in
receiving. Bill Brumback is a four-
time All-American in swimming and
is almost certain to ‘become a two-
time All-American in lacrosse. Whit
Morrill, who graduated in June, is
also an All-American in lacrosse,
and Bill Ingersoll should receive the
same honor. Mike Daniel, last year’s
captain and also this year’s captain
of basketball, was the CAC’s most
valuable player and received second
team Academic All-American.

To aid W&L athletics, a gym-
nasium addition is currently under
construction. According to the new
Athletic Director, Bill McHenry, the
gym should be completed in plenty
of time for the General’s opening
basketball game against Virginia on
December 1 of this year. The new
facilities are outstanding for a school
this size. Mr. McHenry sees the
intramural and intercollegiate con-
flicts as to gym space completely
solved as of September. The elective
Physical Education program will be
expanded.

WAL will also host two tourn-
ments next year; the NCAA college
division swimming championships in
March and the CAC basketball
championship at the end of Febru-
ary. The 2500 seating capacity of
the new gym should accommodate
these meets sufficiently,

With all of W&L’s sports in need
of youth to fill spots vacated by
graduation, Mr. McHenry urges the
entering class of ‘75 to consider
seriously getting involved in athletics.

(Continued from page 2)
perhaps come close to serving their
proper function in our system of
government, we have decided to
eliminate the wasteful display of
theatrics these gatherings have come
to entail.

“Because political conventions
have come to be a true mockery of
the principles this nation was found-
ed on, we have decided to cancel
the usual type of performance. In
its place, we shall conduct, first
with a ballot open to all candidates
and then by a runoff, a primary
election for the entire student body
of Washington and Lee, hoping that
we can set an example for the na-
tional parties in doing this.

“We are attempting to show the
true leadership which George Wash-
ington and Robert E. Lee would
wish us to show. Balloting shall take
place tomorrow. I declare this con-
vention adjourned.”

Well, I can almost hear it. Every-
body’s entitled to one dream.

cisely that same reason.”

He spoke also of the depersonali-
zation of the military brought about
by the computer age: “How do you
talk to punched holes in a computer
card?” he asked.

The services cannot, he stated,
afford to lose sight of the necessity,
never more urgent than now, that
“people talk to people.” The ROTC
program at liberal arts colleges such
as Washington and Lee is essential,
he observed, in filling that function
through the sort of broad education
they provide.

Three undergraduates were pre-
sented two bachelor’s degrees apiece,
both the B.S. and the B.A. at the
commencement exercises. They were
required to meet fully the separate
requirements for each major in each
degree.

Another said, “The things we have
done and seen in this class have
made me more dedicated than ever
to seeing that the pollution cycle
is reversed,”

Dr. Nye says, “It’s my favorite
course. I look forward every year
to teaching it, and I think that any
student should look forward to the
