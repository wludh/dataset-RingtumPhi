Pres. Huntley
Sees Progress
For University

President Robert E. R. Huntley's
address to the student body Wednes-
day afternoon in Doremus Gymna-
sium reviewed the events that had
affected the University over the sum-
mer and stressed facts pertinent to

what he termed “the state of the
University.”
President Huntley remarked on

recent additions to the faculty and
mourned the deaths of several mem-
bers of the campus community. Fle
added that the faculty continues to
be “the major substance of optimism
about the future.”

Plans are being developed to meet
the physical as well as the human
needs of the school, he reported, list-
ing a new fieldhouse, upperclass
dorms and improvements to the
library and theater as examples.

Rush Week 1968, probably the last
first semester rush W&L will see,
concluded Wednesday night with as
much zeal and probably more mis-
haps than in years before.

Clark Carter, President of the In-
terfraternity Council, reported that
approximately 330 of the 340 fresh-
men (about 97%) participated in rush.
As of late Thursday 98 freshmen had
unofficially pledged a __ fraternity.

“little bit higher” than last year,
mainly because more violations were

A Summer Of Loss

Everyone who joins the Washington and Lee University
community realizes that every member is an integral part of
it. The loss of one member will deeply affect all the others.
This was the case this summer as seven people close to Wash-
ington and Lee passed away.

Charles Rice McDowell Sr. died July 6 at the age of 72.
He had been a member of the law school faculty for 41 years.
The summer edition of the Washington and Lee Alumni

Magazine says, “Prof. McDowell and his family have been

so closely associated with the university that it is hard to
separate one from the other.”
Although Prof. McDowell was a humorous author, his

great devotion was to law teaching. He was honored with |

numerous honorary degrees and fraternal memberships for
his outstanding contributions to the legal profession.
The effect which he had over the years upon his classes

is described by a former student: ‘In the many years since |

I left Washington and Lee I have never met a Washington
and Lee law school graduate who did not speak fondly and
admiringly of him. He dedicated his life to teaching all of us

not only the law but the high and fine principles for which |

he always stood. Few men can qualify as a true friend, a good
leader, a learned professor, and a man’s man. He did.’ ”’

Lee Massey McLaughlin, varsity football coach and newly
appointed head of the Department of Physical Education, was
electrocuted on August 13 at his summer camp.

The Richmond Times-Dispatch said, “No Virginian of
his generation, it seems safe to say, did more to build ideals
of high character and true sportsmanship than Lee Mc-
Laughlin.” He was interested primarily in keeping sports on

a high level, rather than in the prevalent mania for winning
at all costs.

But this did not keep Coach “Mac” from winning. After
two years of almost complete disaster when he first came to
W&L as a coach, his teams went through the 1960-61-62 sea-
sons with 25 wins, 1 loss and 1 tie. Last season he coached
W&L to the state small college championship.

Not being able to award scholarships to lure athletes
did not disturb him. He was quoted as saying, “ ‘I think foot-
ball has a place at Washington and Lee, but subsidization not.

here

We're playing sports here as they were originally meant to
be played—for fun and enjoyment.’ With this philosophy
he greatly enriched the lives of those who had the opportunity
to be associated with him.

Andrew David Beckner, a rising sophomore from Martins-
ville, Va., was killed August 10 in an automobile accident in |
Stoneville, N.C.

Beckner had been a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fra-
ternity and a member of the freshman basketball team. In a
basketball game last season against Staunton Military Academy,
he led the team to victory with a last-minute field goal.

Joseph Desha Didier, an 18-year-old freshman from Mau- |
mee, Ohio, died of an apparent heart attack Wednesday after-
noon. During his short residence at Washington and Lee, he
won the respect of many of his fellow classmates. In addition,
he had been offered pledging bids to several fraternities.

Douglas Gaylor (Gay) Crockett died July 10 at the age

of 47. He had been maintenance foreman for the Washing- |

ton and Lee buildings and grounds department for seven years. | |

Mrs. Elizabeth Drury Dickey, the wife of Dr. Robert W.
Dickey, who retired in 1961 as the head of the physics de-
partment here after more than 50 years as a member of the
faculty, passed away on July 18. She had been the chairman
of the visual correction division of Lexington Children’s Clinic
and the organist at Robert E. Lee Memorial Episcopal Church.

Mrs. Rupert N. Latture passed away on August 28. She

was the wife of the retired chairman of the Washington and |

Lee political science department.

Although these people are no longer with us, their achieve-
ments have served to enrich the Washington and Lee Uni-
versity community and all of us who are part of it.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Experienced Generals Face Untested Guilford Team

With 33 lettermen on his squad,
Washington and Lee University head
football coach Buck Leslie should be
pretty optimistic about the coming
campaign.

But he’s been to coaching clinics,
and he knows he’s supposed to poor-
mouth at least a little bit, especially
in public.

“Personnel-wise, we are fairly well
set from last year,” Leslie admits.
“But that doesn’t mean we don't
have some trouble spots.”

One, believe it or not, is a lack
of depth at several key positions,
especially in the offensive line. And
while there’s plenty of experience in
the offensive backfield, the Generals
could stand a littke more beef there,
particularly at fullback.

Leslie has not scheduled any scrim-
mages—"“We're thin, and we can’t
afford to beat each other up.” But
last Monday, after a week of light
workouts and basic fundamentals, the
Generals began some real-nitty-gritty
contact work.

The coaches were obviously pleas-
ed, both with the offense and the
defense.

The Generals’ excellent defensive
unit of last year (four of them made
All-State) returns almost completely
intact, led by co-captains John Wolf
and Scott Mackenzie. Wolf, a tiger
despite limited size, is one of the

best linebackers W&L has ever pro-|'

duced.

Returning with Wolf as linebackers
are veterans Jay Meriwether and the
Kumpuris brothers, junior Dean and
sophomore Drew. The Generals’
front line is long on experience as
well with a quintet of seniors—Mac-
kenzie, Britt McJunkin, John Harris,
Ken Long and Hank Wilson. They
average 204 pounds.

The defensive backfield is led by
last year’s sensational safety, Charley
Freret, who intercepted 10 enemy
passes. Senior letterman Don Sharpe
returns at halfback, and three youngst-
ers—juniors John Nolan and Jay
Dorman and soph Lee Graham—
add a lot of ability to the secondary.

Things are looking up for the
offense, especially at quarterback.
Senior Alan Tomlin has first crack
at the starting job, based on his fine
performance in spring drills, and ac-
cording to Coach Leslie, “he is handl-
ing it very well.”

Junior Chuck Kuhn and Jack Baiz-
ley are “in a dead heat” close be-

hind Tomlin, and both have been
running the General offense well in
practice.

At left half, muscular Luke Cros-
land and junior Joe Dozier have been
putting up a real battle for the job.
“Both will play a lot,” notes Leslie.

Right halfback has been a trouble
spot in the past, but no more with
senior Bucky Cunningham there. Last
year, in his first varsity season Cun-
ningham grabbed 44 passes for 468
yards and two touchdowns, “He looks
as good as ever,” said Leslie, “and
Sam Hinkle (a track man) looks

better than he’s ever looked.”

Fullback has its weaknesses. Senior
Dick Kinney has plenty of experi-
ence, but he’s light. Sophomore Doug
Gossman is a good prospect but
lacks experience.

In the tackle positions, the Gen-
erals have two fairly experienced
performers in Tom McJunkin and
soph Steve Hannon, with good back-
up men in Thornton and Tom Mul-
lenix.

At end, Leslie plans to go with his
experienced duo, John Thomas and
Rick McMillan. Sophomore Frank
Stearns and junior Steve Mahaffey
may play a lot.

 

 

They are (left to right) Alan Tomlin, Chuck Kuhn, and Jack Baizley.

 

Lettermen Reinhard Fischer and
Stamen Ogilvie return at guard, but
the latter is only a sophomore. Andy
Smith, has looked good, and Dee
Copenhaver is coming on strong.

So the Generals have a lot of ex-
perience, with six All-Staters in Mac-
kenzie, Wolf, Sharpe, Freret, Cun-
ningham and Clarke. But they prob-
ably will need every bit of it in the
Opening game Sept. 21 against Guil-
ford.

The Quakers, somewhat of an un-

known quantity due to graduation
losses and a completely new coach-

Field Saturday.

'68 Soccer Team Has Look Of Winner

By ROY CARLTON

Season after season Washington
and Lee's soccer team keeps on win-
ning and this season should be no
exception. Indeed, if coach Joe Lyles’
team stays healthy, they have a fine
chance of bettering last year’s 9-3
record.

Back from last year’s team is sure-
fire All-America candidate Scott
Fechnay. In his previous three cam-
paigns, Fechnay completely demor-
alized opponents with his brilliant
ball control and scoring ability. (Last
year, Scott scored all five goals as
WAL topped VMI 5-4.)

But Fechnay is not the only cause
for optimism. His fellow co-captain,
Thom Mitchell, is a goalie “par ex-
cellence.” Mitchell was unbeatable
last year, and proved to be the win-
ning difference in numerous games.
His speed and agility won him an
All-State selection, and this year

‘shouldn't be any different.

Also back is Jack Horowitz, an
outstanding senior lineman who team-
ed up with Fechnay on numerous
scoring plays. Horowitz is a speedy
little guy who plays excellent de-
fense. If he keeps up his fine per-
formances, Horowitz may very well
join his teammates, Fechnay and
Mitchell, as an All-Stater this year

Since only three seniors graduated
from last years team, there should
be little problem in fielding an ex-
perienced squad. Other key players
beck from last year's team include
junior John Yow and Brian Price, and
last fall's freshman starter Carl Hiait.

All not roses however. The
squad is extremely thin. The
freshman team was hardly a power-
house, and so, eXperienced and cap-

is

Assistant Coach E. Graham (Buck)
Leslie was named acting head foot-
ball coach at Washington and Lee
University on August 22.

In making the announcement, Uni-
versity President Robert E. R. Huntley
also said that retiring athletic director
E. P. (Cy) Twombly would continue
in that position for the time being.

The announcements followed the
sudden death on August 13 of head
football coach Lee M. McLaughlin,
whose appointment as athletic director
to succeed Twombly was to have
become effective Sept. 1.

“We are fortunate that we have
on our staff such experienced leaders
who can take over Lee McLaughlin's
duties at this time of tragedy and
carry on the athletic program in his
spirit,” President Huntley said.

The 43-year-old Leslie has been
assistant football coach in charge of
the backfield since he joined the WAI
faculty in 1960. Twombly, 71, has
been on the University athletic staff

director since 1954

| The major concern of all the

Macon-W &L seminar plans
to study intimate possibility
of joint curricula program

An experimental seminar consist-
ing of Washington and Lee and Ran-
dolph-Macon Woman's College stu-
dents will again be conducted this
fall. The seminar was initiated last
spring by the Randolph-Macon stu-
dent government and sponsored here
by Phi Eta Sigma and the Student
Curriculum Committee. The seminar
plans to meet every other week at
alternating schools, with the host
school providing one or more pro-
fessors to lead the evening's discus-
sion.

The purpose of these experimental
sessions is twofold: first, to explore
the feasability of such joint seminars
with the possibility in mind that such
seminars may become a part of the
accredited curricula of both schools
in the near future; second, to explore

the value of the interdisciplinary ap- |

proach to a given topic or problem.

Applications for participation in
this semester's seminar are now be-
ing accepted. They should contain
grade-point average, major, and
special interests. The applications
should be submitted to Swede Hen-
berg at Pi Kappa Alpha no later than
this Friday.

Robert Edward Royall Huntley's
inaugural plans are now being finaliz-
ed. The inaugural activities commence
Friday, October 17 with an informal

The following morning, the twen-
tieth inaugural ceremony will take
place at 11 a.m. on the front lawn—
weather permitting.

The acaedmic procession will in-
clude the president and the speaker;
members of the Board of Trustees;

University nets
increased gifts

A program based on communica-
tion as well as a plea for contribu-
tions has resulted in larger collections
by the Alumni Association Fund and
the Parents’ Fund. In both of these
areas, the contributions exceeded the
amount received last year and the
goals set for this year.

The Alumni Fund's goal last year
was $225,000, but only $210,655 was
collected. This year, however, the
goal set at $250,000 was exceeded;
total contributions were $277,771.

The Parents’ Fund, although it has
no goal, is showing an amount almost
double that of last year. Last year's
contributions were $13,800; this year,
parents gave more than $24,900,

The Robert E. Lee Associates, an
organization comprised of people who
have contributed $1000 or more,
added 106 people to its ranks. Their
total contributions came to $197,231.

 

According to Farris Hotchkiss, as-
| sociate director of university develop-
ment, no goals have been set for
| mext year’s drive. The Alumni Board
| of Directors will meet October 18
'to set the goal, which will be in-
creased. A further attempt at better
communication with the parents and
/the alumni will be made, with the
stress on the personal approach.

Danford Fellowships will
offer financial assistance
for prospective teachers

Applications for Danforth Fellow-
ships for graduate study are now be-
ing accepted by Dean Farrar, the
liaison officer for the Danforth Fel-
lowships on campus. The fellowships
are offered by the Danforth Founda-
tion of St. Louis. These fellowships
are open to college graduates who
wish to continue their education and
who have a serious interest in col-
lege teaching as a career.

Approximately 120 fellowships will
be awarded in March of 1969. They
will be eligible for four years of
financial assistance, with maximum
annual living stipend of $2400 for
single and $2950 for married fel-
lows, plus tuition and fees.

The Danforth Foundation was
created in 1927 by the late Mr. and
Mrs. William Danforth as a_ phil-
anthropy devoted to giving aid and
encourangement to persons, to em-
phasizing the humane values that
come from a religious and democratic
heritage, and to strengthening the
essential quality of education.

as Troubadour Theatre begins new season

Improved facilities and an experi-
mental program mark the upcoming
season at the Troubadour Theatre.
The addition of a lobby and a work-
shop and the installation of an up-
to-date heating system will provide
the old building with a degree of
comfert and efficiency. Formation of
what Troubadour director Lee Kahn
calls an “intermedia group” will add
a new dimension

 

The lobby is scheduled for comple-
tion by October 30, opening night of
the first Troubadour production, A
somewhat later date is set for the
completion of the workshop, although,
since this wing will house the heat-
ing unit, the walls and ceiling will
be up soon. The old staircase is also

being replaced; offices and a dressing |

room will occupy the second floor

*

——

 

For the first time in its history,
the Troubadour Theatre will have an
intermedia program. When asked the
definition of “intermedia,” Mr. Kahn
stated: “Intermedia can best be de-
scribed as environmental theatre; that
is, some form of skit or play which
is impromptu in appearance, but
nevertheless carefully planned.”

Intermedia performances may be
held at any time and ai any place
As Mr. Kahn put it, “Someday the
Ring-tum Phi might carry an an-
nouncement saying: ‘at such-and-such
a time and at such-and-such a place,

Lintermedia will happen.’ The Troub-
-ladour director made

it clear that,
even if no audience materializes, in-
termedia would take place for the
benefit of the performers themselves

Lugene lonesco’s “Exit the King’
is the first scheduled Troubadour pro
duction; it will run from October 30
to November 2. The second play in

4 the Troubadour program is an adap-

tion of Euripides’ “The Bacchae” by
Dr. Keith Shillington. Second semes
ter, the Troubadours will present
“America Hurrah!” by Jean Claude
van Itaille, and another “spotlight
production,” an undisclosed play by
an unknown author

This Thursday, the Troubs will hold
their first staff meeting. To comple-

ment its improved facilities, the
Troubadour Theatre will also enjoy
a large membership this year. Besides
returning upperclassmen, thirty-eight

freshman have expressed to Mr. Kahn
an interest in working for the Theaire

The natural bridge

Uppermost in the minds of the faculty in requiring de-
ferred rush was the belief that the present system retards
assimilation into a college atmosphere. Assuming then that the
faculty and administration are interested in the early impres-
sions made upon freshmen, we urge that freshman camp in
Natural Bridge, Va., be seriously questioned as to it values
ot drawbacks in this regard.

Freshman camp is a depressing and unnecessary preface
to a college career, a psychological degradation whose worth-
while components could more easily be absorbed in Lexington.
At one time it was believed that freshman camp promoted
class unity and spirit, afforded a mini-vacation to ease tension
before the start of classes, and decimated the likelihood of pre-
rush-week rush. None of these is now a factor.

Freshmen are forced to sleep two to a bed in cold rooms,
spend their time listening to an array of speeches as their
counselors loll in the grass (bored), and play games on teams
whose unity approaches zero. Few of those who attend are
impressed, and a vacation freshman camp is not.

As for dangerous exposure to evil upperclassmen, we have
advocated and will continue to speak in favor of free, open,
total contact for freshmen with all other Washington and Lee
students as the only fair assimilation—and a wholly valuable
one. In addition, the absence of rush next September affords
an excellent opportunity to abandon freshman camp and adopt
University-based orientation.

There is another argument in favor of retaining camp, that
freshmen are compelled, if by logistics alone, to attend all the
meetings. This could easily be handled in Lexington by invok-
ing the cautions of the Honor System.

Orientation is an integral phase of assimilation which could
better be accomplished on the campus. Freshmen would still
be able to attend talks by faculty members and students and
the welcoming addresses, would have the benefits of counsel-
ing in their own rooms, and would definitely be less likely to
spend two miserable nights and two harried days in what most
of them regard as an extreme absurdity.

A breach of tradition

Among students and alumni of Washington and Lee there
is an emotion approaching pride in the several traditions of
the University. Of the three most publicized—the Honor
System, coat and tie dress, and speaking to everyone on
campus—only the Honor System deserves being labeled a
tradition.

The speaking “tradition” has all but died, perhaps be-
cause there are too many people to speak to or perhaps be-
cause it’s no longer sophisticated to do so.

As for the wearing of coats and ties, this tradition will not
die because some choose not to follow it. It may, however,
cease to be a tradition if it must be enforced.

The loss of fining powers by the Assimilation Committee
three years ago was in tradition’s behalf. Any custom, if it is
to become tradition, must be voluntary: if one is made to wear

a tie, then the tradition will not be that of wearing ties but |

rather of being made to wear them.

A specific case is the enforcement of conventional dress
in the dining hall by dormitory counselors, who have among
them what amounts to the right of sanctioned harassment.
Let there be no mistake—we ourself are dressed in coat and
tie every day; we are not, though, so attired on pain of being
denied a meal. It must certainly be inspiring to freshmen to
have a dormitory counselor invoke a childish regulation under
the respectable guise of tradition.

Toward a better library

It would be an understatement to say that everyone wel-
comes the initial volley of changes in McCormick Library;
the feeling contains a great deal of amazement. In reversing
a good many policies followed in previous years, Mr. Leach
has completely opened the library—physically as well as in its

attentiveness to the students and faculty. We look forward to |

the library's approaching total integration with the needs of
Washington and Lee.

To the students

This will be a student newspaper, which it has not always
been. In the past, contributions from those not on the staff
received somewhat less than just consideration. This year,
every shade of student opinion may be brought to light—not
only on the second page, but also in the first regular column
of editorial comment printed on the front page by a Virginia
college newspaper.

In our efforts to make the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi a true
student paper, we have not forgotten that it must be read, We
invite criticism and contributions of any nature, and will make
a genuine effort to provide total coverage of University events.

We do not promise to publish every article, notice, or
letter received, Our task is to serve the Washington and Lee
community, which necessitates selectivity, demands compet-
ence, and is based on fairness. We hope to provide all three.

 

 

Doc’s and Lyric

Theatre gam

new managements and facades

By REED BYRUM
Managing Editor

An air of change has indeed spread
throughout Lexington; on campus,
Robert E. R. Huntley assumes the
presidency of Washington and Lee
next month, while around the town
two traditional standard-bearers, Doc
of the Corner Grill and Ed Side of
The Lyric Theater have ceased work-
ing to go into retirement.

After twenty-three years of faith-
ful and congenial service to the stu-
dents of W&L and VMI, Carl “Doc”
Collett sold out his business this past
month to “take it easy for a while.”
Doc felt that his age was the most
compelling factor in his decision and
that now he cannot do as much as
he had been doing: he vows, however,
that after a sufficient rest period he
will return to work of a much less
demanding sort than his previous line.

In his close to two and a_ half
decades in Lexington, Doc and his
wife have become _ institutionalized
traditions of W&L. They have lived
and grown with the school and with
its progress have also advanced. They
added both the back-room and the
taproom during the past eight years
to take care of the constantly en-
larging student body.

Reminiscing about the years past,
Doc recalls when the speaking and
conventional dress traditions were still
respected by the student body. He
remembers that the students looked
much better and acted accordingly:
he feels that a friendlier atmosphere
prevailed when the speaking tradi-
tion was intact and is especially sorry
of its passing. Doc also recalls that,
when they were students at W&L,
Robert Huntley, the next president
of Washington and Lee, and Roger
Mudd, CBS news commentator, used
to sit around drinking beer in the
Corner Grill.

Doc has enjoyed his tenure in Lex-
ington very much and feels that above
all, it has kept him young. Both he
and Mrs. Doc are saddened by their
retirement, but realize that the new

 

 

 

owners, R. J. Carter and C. H. Mull,
will carry on the great tradition of
the Corner Grill.

Carter and Mull, both former state
police officers, have already taken
over the business and can be ob-
served daily behind the front counter.
Mr. Carter explained that he enjoys
the restaurant business and likes
especially the public and the students,

The new proprietors plan to re-
Open the taproom for patronage to
the public on Friday and Saturday
nights from 5:00 until 11:00 p.m;
from Monday through Thursday
nights it will be available for private
dinners and parties,

The Lyric Cinema has also taken |
R/C |

on new ownership, with the
Company buying out Ed Side and
with John “Mike” Hession replac-
ing him as manager. Mike has com-
pletely remodeled the interior of the
theater and has completely destroyed
all claims that it may have to being
“The Pit;” new carpeting, seat covers,
and wall paper have ultimately chang-
ed the appearance into a beautiful and
clean movie theater,

Mike plans to continue Side’s policy
of showing only art films, but points
out that today only a thing line exists
between art and commercial flicks.
Moreover, he plans to show once
every month an adult film. Two such
films which will appear next Friday
are “Hot Skin and Cold Cash” and
“Good Time With A Bad Girl.” “Hot
Skin” is the bizarre story of “the
stark reality of the private life of a
prostitute,” who claims that what her
husband doesn't know, won't hurt
him. “Good Time” is a flick which,
as Hession said, doesn’t leave much
to the imagination. Saying the least,
the new Lyric Theater will indeed |
not only uphold, but will probably |
surpass the standards of movie show- |
ing intiated by our beloved and great |
Professor Side.

Another new feature of the Lyric!
Cinema is its showing of relatively
recent pictures; among these up-com-
ing flicks will be a series of Shake-
spearian classics,

 

 

 

 

 

Peale’s Lafayette on display in Washington gallery

W&L lends Smithsonian famous portrait

By MACK WOODWARD

One of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity's most prized pieces of art,
Charles Wilson Peale's portrait of
the Marquis de Lafayette, has been
loaned to the Smithsonian Institution
in Washington, D.C.

The portrait will be on display
when the Smithsonian unveils its new
national museum of art, the National
Portrait Gallery, this fall in the na-
tion's capital,

The portrait shows Lafayette in
the uniform of the Continental Army

| when he fought with George Wash-

 

ingion for America’s independence.
Washington himself commissioned
Peale to paint the portrait and it
was delivered to Washington in 1781

The portrait, along with many
others, passed through inheritance
from the Washington to the Lee
family, and through the latter came
into the University’s possession. In
this way also the University acquired
its more famous Peale portrait, that
of Washington in his Virginia mili-
tary uniform, now displayed in Lee
Chapel on the campus

Also included in the Lee Collection,
which passed into the University's
hands are the James Sharples portrait
of G. W. P, Custis, Van Dyke's por-
traits of the Custis Ancestor Wife
and the Custis Ancesior Man, and
John Wollaston’s portraits of Martha

Washington, Daniel Parke Custis, and |
| ton dating to 1836

John Parke and Martha Custis

 

The Lee Collection also includes
many portraits of which the author's
identity has remained obscure. These
include Miss Custis, Frances Parke
Custis, Elizabeth Parke Custis, John
Custis Hl, William Henry Fitzhugh
of Chatham, and William Henry Fitz-
hugh of Ravensworth.

The portrait of General Lafayette,
when at Washington and Lee hangs
in the west wall of the lobby of
McCormick Library. Also hanging in
the library are the Gilbert Stuart
portrait of George Washington and
G.P.A, Healey porirait, copied from
the Stuart, of Thomas Jefferson.

The Peale Lafayette will be one
of four by the artist among the ap-
proximately three hundred works on
display where the National Portrait
Gallery opens to the public October

tional dress in Evans Dining Hall,
It was the feeling of eight out of ten
members of the E. C. that the dress
of freshmen in the dining hall had
suffered a gradual decay down to the
point where some freshmen were
wearing shorts and sweatshirts to the
meals, and that something had to be
done to curb the decline.

In lieu of the situation the E.C.
has adopted the policy that conven-—
tional dress will be required of fresh- |
men in the dining hall. It will be
the duty of the Dormitory Counselors
to deal with offenders and if neces-
sary report repeated violators to the
Student Control Committee. The
members of the E.C. certainly hope
that such action will not be necessary,
but feel that if conventional dress
can be encouraged in the dining hall,
the mode will be set for all campus
activities,

Of course, we expect some criticism
in the whole idea of “enforced tradi-
tions” but let me say frankly that
W&L men who are genuinely interst-
ed in seeing the coat and tie tradi-
tion preserved at Washington and Lee,
men who feel that this tradition is
a worthy one which shows pride not
only in one’s school, but in oneself.
who feel that this tradition sets an
atmosphere of gentlemanly conduct in
all activities, which is our goal, these
men will do all that they can to
encourage conventional dress among
their friends and fellow students.

If we had more of these men on
the campus such action by the E.C.
would not be necessary. Hopefully the
Class of 1972 will have such men and
the critics will have nothing to com-
plain about,

In an entirely separate area, the
new E.C. voted unanimously to sup
port the plea of every returning mem-
ber of the Cold Check Committee to
expand its jurisdiction into the area
of overdue accounts. In this capacity,
the committee will not act as a col
lecting agency, but rather only as an
investigating body

Washington and Lee's football

team opened its 1968 season on

Saturday before a somewhat less than
enthusiastic crowd at Wilson Field,
The results of this year were practic-
ally the same as last year despite
some fine individual performances.
Although the score showed 28-0, the
defense played a fine game and the
offense appeared substantially better
than last year.

The big difference in the game was
the superb Guilford defense which
kept W&L pinned back deep in its
own territory for most of the game.
Led by freshman Tommy Peguese
with two interceptions, the Quakers’
defense set up three of the four Guil-
ford touchdowns and just missed
getting another when the final gun
sounded.

The Generals dominated the initial
stages of play. The offense led by
Alan Tomlin, began a 14 play drive
that went all the way to the Guilford
4. Mixing his plays beautifully, he
sent Crosland around the ends on
sweeps for consistent big yardage. In
several close yardage situations, Dick
Kinney was called upon to deliver.
As the workhorse of the backfield,
Kinney not only picked up the one
yard, but three or four as well, in-
cluding one fourth down effort. On
two occasions, Tomlin ran for good
yardage on pass option rollouts, But
the offense sputtered on the Guilford
4 with three incomplete passes.
Rather than attempt the field goal, the
Generals tried to pass for the touch-
down on fourth down, but were un-
successful.

Guilford couldn't move the ball,
though, and was forced to punt. From
here on the Quaker offense started
working, and punt exchanges gradu-
ally worked the Generals deep into
their owne territory. Late in the half,
with the ball on their own three, the
Generals fumbled. The Guilford of-
fense took over, and with 4:52 left in
the period, Larry Funkhouser drove
over for the score.

Following the successful extra
point, it all happened again. Luke
Crosland taking the ball on a sweep,
was hit hard. The ball squirted out
of his hands, and Guilford guard
Ed Allen fell on it on the W&L 19.
Even worse for the Generals was that
Crosland injured his leg on the play
and had to be carried off the field.
Almost vengefully, the Guilford quart-
erback, Ray Tavalaro, was racked up
on the next play and he never re-
appeared. This didn't stop the Quak-
er’s momentum, however, as the re-
placement, Mike Bobbuzzi, swept
around left end for the score at 2:34.

With a rather poor kickoff return,
the Generals took possession on their
23. Hard pressure on Tomlin drove
the Blue all the way back to their

9, and once again they had to kick.
A good runback gave Guilford the
ball on the W&L 20. Within three
plays the Quakers scored again. With
0:18 left to go, the point was good
and W&L trailed at the half 21-0.

The game died in the second half.
The Generlas came out with a new
The Generals came out with a new
offense. Chuck Kuhn took over the
quarterbacking, and Joe Dozier and
Doug Gossman were the running
backs.

Only once did the Generals mount
an offensive in the third quarter. With
the Blue threatening on the Guilford
29, Tommy Peguese picked off a pass
and brought it back to his 47. A long
pass to Mike Hunt took the Quakers
to the W&L 2. But the Generals,
putting up a fierce resistence on the
next play forced a fumble and stopped
them for the moment. Once more
the Generals were unable to move
the ball. A punt gave Guilford the
ball on the W&L 45. On third and
ten, Bobby Spain took in a bomb in
the Generals’ end zone. With the point
good, the score stood: Guilford 28,
WAL 0. At 1:23 in the game, the
Generals were given one last chance
to score when quarterback Bob Cross
of Guilford fumbled on his 18. Once
again, however, Tommy Peguese in-
tercepted a Jack Baizley pass on his
4. He ran it back to the W&L 26 and
the clock ran out,

The big problem the team faced
was an inability to keep momentum
going after the initial touchdown

 

failure in the first quarter. After that

 

the Generals failed to mount any kind
of offensive at all. The line faced
difficulties in opening holes, and this
problem became worse as the game
wore on.

The Generals offense also suffered }-

in that it’s passing game was not
used with nearly the potency of last
year. Last year with Andy Bloom
at quarterback, Bucky Cunningham
became the darling of Wilson Field
fans. Alan Tomlin is certainly the
equal of Bloom at quarterback, and
yet, his passing talents and the great
talents of Cunningham weren't used
until late in the third quarter when
the game was out of reach,

On the defensive side there isn’t
much to say. The defense played a
fine game which the final score belies.
Three of the four times in which
the Quakers scored they got the ball
inside the Generals 40 yard line.
The defensive backfield also failed at
a few critical moments, It must be
realized that this was the first game
of the season, the team has only
been practicing for about two weeks,
a new head coach had to step into
a difficult situation, and the Quakers
turned out to be an extremely good
team.

Next week the Blue faces the
Randolph-Macon Yellowjackets away.
In last year’s game the Generals
staved off a fourth quarter rally by
RMC to win a 13-12 game. This is
a crucial game in the battle for the
state small college championship and
it should be watched closely.

W&L students too cool for football

By ROY CARLTON
Sports Editor

For the second consecutive year
Guilford mauled Washington and
Lee. In all fairness to the Generals,
it must be said that they put up a
hard fight: spirits were high, and the
boys were out to win; the offense |
showed that the first time they had |
the ball.

But how long can a team maintain
high spirits when the home field ad-|
vantage is working against it? The
Guilford crowd, though small, was)
certainly vocal. The Guilford cheer- |
leaders completely drowned out the
one or two visiting W&L partisians.
Ihe Generals played at Guilford last
year, why did they have to go through
all that again this year? They didn't
have to, but they did. And the game
was played on Wilson Field.

The problem wasn't that there
weren't any W&L students at the
game. True, attendance wasn't extra-

ordinary, but it wasn't terrible either.
The amazing thing is that they never
cheered or applauded or did any-
thing, except for a little while in the
first quarter. Or maybe it isn't so

It has become almost a tradition
at this school for the student never
to cheer. He must keep his cool and
blend into the stadium. Whether the
game is close or not, he leaves after
the first quarter. Its a lot more en-

 

 

 

 

 

 

joyable to sit with your date in the

| fraternity house and watch the game

on the tube.

How come nobody told the folks
from Guilford that? They came about
forty strong, excluding ten cheerlead-
ers, and made more noise than you'll
ever hear on Wilson Field. They
stayed until the end of the game, too.

This game wasn't the only one
where the visitors have brought with
them the home field advantage. Dur-
ing the last basketball season, W&L
had a home basketball game with
Bridgewater. There couldn't have been
more than three hundred W&L stu-
dents in Doremus, yet the Gym was
packed. Whenever time was called,
the Bridgewater cheerleaders would
run on to the court and start shaking
rafters. Numerous other instances |
could be cited, but they're unneces-|
sary.

There was a high school marching
band at Saturday's game (why W&L
doesn't have some kind of band is a
mystery). Several times toward the
end of the game they'd start a cheer. |
At last, recovered fumble gave |
WAL the ball on the Guilford 26.
The band members started screaming

 

“We want a touchdown.” The Guil-|
ford fans sat deathly silent. So did/|
the WAL fans. There couldn't have |
been more than two students cheering
along with the high school kids, |
Maybe it's because they wore white
socks,

It isn’t really that there isn’t any)
spirit at this school, there's a lot of
it. It shows up whenever Wahoos are
trying to snake a WAL date. Students
at this school are proud of it, They
smugly reflect that it's the best school
in Virginia, It doesn't need support,
it's clearly superior, That's why Guil-
ford won

Belmont-Abbey beats booters despite rally

Disspirited play by the home team
and a fine effort by Belmont-Abbey
forward Bob Schambach contributed
to W&L’s first soccer loss of the
season, 4-3. The Generals entered the
game as the favorite with bright hopes
for the season, but a dogged B-A
attack kept the Generals on the de-
fensive for most of the game.

The Generals couldn't seem to get
started until late in the game. They
seem to be, as in the past, a pres-
sure team which responds well to
important games and clutch  situa-
tions, but which starts slowly when
favored. Oveconfidence took its toll
yesterday, despite a strong rally in
the second half.

The Blue were clearly the superior
team with better team play and ex-
cellent ball control, but the determin-
ed team from Belmont-Abbey con-
tinually managed to break things up.
Schambach scored midway through
the first period with an assist by
Jack Murphy. B-A_ goalie Mike

Keeney played well, stopping early |

shots by W&L aces John Yow and
Scott Fechnay.

In the sceond period, Schambach
scored his second goal with an assist
from Pat Cunningham. The Generals
were completely frustrated, as the
B-A defense held fast against any
scoring attempts.

 

With the coming of the third quart: |

er. the Generals were a new team,
determined to erase the Crusaders’
2-0 lead. A fierce attack netted two
quick goals for the Blue, both by
All-America candidate Fechnay. Early
in the quarter, Fechnay fired in a
shot on a beautiful feed by Curt
Jamison. Moments later, B-A was
penalized for illegal use of hands, and
Fechnay was awarded a free shot
With perfect reliability, Fechnay

kicked the shot through the Belmont-
Abbey wall and into the net to tie
the game.

However, there was still plenty of
fight left in the Crusaders and Bobby
Schambach scored again on an assist
from Cunningham to make the score
3-2 before the end of the quarter.

Almost with the beginning of the
final quarter, Dick Ivey drilled in a
shot on an assist from Scott Fechnay
to tie the score once more. The Gen-
erals were not about to settle for a

to beat, but if they receive as small
a number of spectators as they did
in the Belmont-Abbey game, then they
will assuredly lose any initiative to
win. The spirit of the few B-A sup-
porters and of the boys on the bench
was indeed impressive and far above
the meager attempt at enthusiasm
made by the W&L fans. If the Gen-
erals are going to put forth the
athletic effort, then the least that the
fans can do is to give them their
well-deserved support.

net incessantly in an effort to punch
in the winning goal.

Joe Mertes and converted it into the |
winning score of the game. The Gen-|
erals were contained from here on)

To make any system of rush work,
it is vital that the fraternities adhere
to the rules established by the IFC—
particularly in regard to “dirty rush,”
which if anything probably increased
this year. Rather than reduce this
problem, the new rush which spans
14 to 16 weeks increases the op-
portunity for “dirty rush.” Only by

If it is too idealistic to think of
a rush system at W&L that excludes
slandering of one another's houses
then this article is obviously wasted.
If, however, it is possible that such
a system could exist here, then now
is the time for fraternities to begin
working for such a system before the
present methods of rush cause the
demise of the fraternity system from
| within at a time when fraternities are
| being severely tested.

Lin Hartin happened upon a rather
amazing find in the library basement)

 

the other day.
Hartin, a senior from Columbus, |
Ga., was brousing in the stacks when |

he ran across autographed copies of |
both volumes of “Lord Randolph
Chuchill.” They were autographed by
the author, Winston Spencer Churc-
hill, and in addition there was a
letter pasted into the front cover
of Vol. 1 to Mrs. John W. Davis, |
who had apparently sent the books

to Churchill to be authographed. The
University came into the possession
of these and other books in 1956
when the library of John W. Davis,
a W&L alumnus and Democratic
candidate for President in 1928, was
bequeathed to W&L.

The letter, dated June 6, 1920, is
written on Admiralty stationery and

says that Churchill is “much obliged
.for your kind letter and pleased

to think that my inscription should

add to your interest in my book.”

Churchill wrote the book lagely to

Churchill's two-volume work was
generally well-accepted by the critics
and by the reading public. Several
noted the excellent description it con-
tained of the inner workings of
British politics of the late 19th Cen-
tury, and most lauded its amazingly
objective portrait of Lord Randolph,
considering his relationship with the
author.

thing of a homecoming for UNC's
President Friday, since he is a native
of nearby Raphine.

Dr. Friday grew up in Dallas, N.C.,
where his father was a textile ma-
| chinery manufacturer, attended Wake
Forest for a year, then entered North
Carolina State, where he was gradu-
ated in textile engineering in 1941,

After World War II naval service,
President Friday received his law de-
gree from UNC in Chapel Hill. He
then served as assistant dean of stu-
dents there and in 1951 became ad-
ministrative assistant to President
Gordon Gray of the consolidated Uni-
| versity of North Carolina, which in-
| cludes the campuses at Chapel Hill,
Raleigh, Greensboro and Charlotte.

He subsequently became the secre-
tary of the consolidated university
and was named its president in 1956.
| Dr. Friday served as chairman of
the President's Task Force on Educa-
tion, the President's Commission on
White House Fellows, and as a di-
rector of the American Council of
Education. A member of the board
of visitors of Davidson College, he is
a former chairman of the Southern
Regional Education Board and a
member of both the Carnegie Found-
| ation for the Advancement of Teach-
ing and the Carnegie Commission on
the Future of Higher Education. He
currently serves on the board of The
Urban Institute.

After the inauguration there will
be a luncheon for the delegates at
1:15 p.m. in Evans Dining Hall. The
Inaugural Committee was appointed
by President Huntley and has planned
the program. It is composed of Leon

We Will Cooperate iii

The Ring-tum Phi, as an important segment of Washing-
ton and Lee University, is proud of the relationship we have
with all of the business concerns in the Lexington area. We
attempt to keep the student body informed about new busi-
nesses opening up in this area and we cooperate with them
in giving them publicity for any special events they sponsor.
In return, these businesses are willing to lend students certain
things ranging from staples to cars and trucks. Whenever this
relationship is severed, we feel there is a need to restate our
position. Certain events of Friday, September 20, have brought
us to this conclusion.

 

The above events centered about the Ring-tum Phi’s using
a metal cutter located at the Lexington News-Gazette Com-
mercial Printing Department. The only reason we wanted to
use someone else’s cutter was that ours, which was on order,
had not arrived. When we asked the printing firm for as-
sistance, the business manager rejected our request.

We realize if all the employees had been busy at the time,
our matter would not have taken precedence over all others
(even though this simple, but necessary, task would have taken
less than five minutes). But not all of the employees were
occupied, What was implied in the business manager’s argu-
ment was that the Ring-tum Phi should be totally responsible
for its operations since we now own a photo-lathe machine
(see picture on page 1), thus taking revenue from the News-
Gazette printing department whose equipment we had used
in the past.

We agree with the manager's argument wholeheartedly,
and we are trying to become more independent. However,
when we have problems we would like to turn toward the print-
ing department for help, in the same way it HAS AND
WILL CONTINUE TO TURN TOWARD Washington and
Lee for assistance.

It is true that the Ring-tum Phi took away a substantial
amount of business from the commercial printing department.
However, we did this only because we were able to buy the
photo-lathe machine for less money than we paid the print-
ing department last year.

In the final analysis, it is important to understand that
the Ring-tum Phi is a non-profit newspaper supported by stu-
dent fees, subscriptions and advertising. Although its pur-
poses are purely educational, it can also act in the capacity
of a public servant. The Ring-tum Phi is not in competition
with any other publication anywhere, nor do we want to be.
We are here to serve the student body and the community
in any way possible. We are willing to cooperate if we receive a
certain amount of cooperation in return.

What Could It Do?

bridge County. This school is an
integral part of the community as
an employer and consumer. In turn,
fraternities are an integral part of
WAL life and if WAL is to partici-
pate in the community in any
meaingful way then it is up to the
fraternities to take the first largest

This past week the Interfraternity
Council served as overseer for rush
week, making the preparations, super-
vising, and in the end fining various
fraternities almost $1,000 for rush

violations. Now that over 80 percent
of the freshmen have accepted bids,
the IFC, if it follows the pattern
of previous judicial boards, will lapse
into the routine of monotonous and
insignificant Monday night meetings.

The regular functions that IFC
performs for the fraternity system
will be taken care of—pledging and
depledging, scheduling of parties, and
the annual heart fund drive. In addi-
tion, the IFC treasury will give $2,500
to Contact and will also partially
subsidize the living expenses of an
exchange student. And, although
these are worthwhile endeavors, they
are also typical of the involvement of
the IFC in campus activities. That is,
the IFC is merely a financial patron,
and it is this fact of life at WAL that

is the cause of most criticism that is|

heaped upon fraternities

There is on this campus a gen-
eral lack of social awareness. Some
of faculty members and students
take an active part in community
action programs, yet the over-
whelming majority of both groups
tend to isolate themselves from
problems of Lexington and Rock-

 

step.

The IFC represents a larger num-
ber of students than any other organi-
zation on campus and because of this,
it has the responsibility to do more
than make a financial contribution to
campus and community activities. Al
WAL, a great deal of time has been
spent to develop intellectually strong
and socially oriented students, but
very little effort has been

Chicago: A Daley Affair

By DANNY LEONARD delegates going into the Humphrey
camp. By postponing endorsement of
a candidate until Wednesday, Daley
caused uncalled for speculation about
the possible candidacy of Ted Ken-
nedy, whom he never had any inten-
tion of backing. Wednesday morning
Daley came out for Humphrey along
with most of the Illinois delegation—
and the specualtion was ended and
the Democrats had a candidate.

For the past three weeks, I have
heard the Democratic National Con-
vention called a little bit of every-
thing from “A Great Victory for
Hubert” to “A National Embarrass-
ment.” I would like to add to the
long list of titles one that I deem
very appropriate: “The Daley Affair.”
It is an appropriate title, I think, for
two reasons:

(1) It was the strategy of Mayor
Richard J. Daley that won the con-
vention for Humphrey.

(2) It was the strategy of Mayor
Richard J. Daley that resulted in
blood in the streets and victory for
the far left.

Let me explain. Humphrey's strat-
egy for winning the nomination de-
pended on two key figures: Richard
M. Nixon and Richard J. Daley. It
was a strategy based on the candidacy
of Nixon and the fiction of Daley's
“non-commitment.” The plan was to
woo and win the conservative South,
even if it meant angering the liberal,
industrial North, Strategists figured
that with Nixon as the only other
choice, the disgrunted liberals would
nonetheless have to fall into the
Humphrey camp.

The choice of Senator Muskie as
his running mate was also used by
Humphrey to calm the liberals. The
non-commitment front of Daley was
used to make the convention appear
open. In a similar attempt to fool
the delegates and the public into
believing that Chicago was an open
convention, Humphrey strategists told
the press that more than 1,000 dele-

Daley's charade of “non-com-
mitment” was designed to give the
impression that the Democratic Na-
tional Convention was an “open”
convention, Daley’s endorsement of
Humprey was timed to set the ball
rolling toward nomination, Just
like a Broadway play, the plot—
the strategy—was well thought out
and well timed; amateur acting
may prove to be the downfall of
“The Daley Affair” in November.

Mayor Daley proved to be a ham,
not only inside the convention hall,
but in the streets of Chicago as well.
Had he not been so willing and so
insistent on proving to America that
Chicago is Daley’s town, that mess
that we all witnessed in the streets
of Chicago could have been avoided.
Daley termed them as hard-core com-
munists that had to be put down
ruthlessly. Make no mistake about
ii—those brutal attacks were not the
fault of the police force; they were
only under orders. They were the
fault of the one man responsible for
giving those orders: Richard J. Daley.
The police do not have the back-
ground, the education, and the under-
standing to cope with a beard spit-
ting in their faces. But it seems the
Mayor of the City of Chicago would!

Sure, there probably were some
hard-core communists leading that
group. But for the most part, that
crowd of some 4,000 young people
was a peace-loving crowd with only
one thing in mind: a peace plank on
Vietnam. If they had been allowed
to say what they had on their minds,
the far-left wingers would have had
little luck gaining support for their
programs to destroy this democracy,
If those young people had only been
allowed their dignity, they would have
letf Chicago quietly, their wants ap-
peased, and feeling that maybe even
Youth can have a say about what
goes on in this, the American De-
mocracy. Instead of handling them
with the care they deserved, Mayor
Daley ordered the police to use what-
ever force was necessary to subdue
them,

 

Who knows now in which camp
these young people will settle? I'm
quite sure of one thing—they won't
feel at home in the U. S, as long
as they know their dissenting voice

Backroads To The Hill

By BOB BAROODY

| have decided that Rosemary's
baby grew up into that cinematic
product of evil known on marquees
throughout the nation as Lee Marvin.
In mocking our straight-jacket men-
tality Marvin hits below the belt
and gets away with it; so does “Rose-
mary’s Baby.”

“Rosemary's Baby” (from the novel
by Ira Levin) is the story of an
actor’s wife who is delivered to Satan
by her husband and a congenial band
of witches so that she might have
a child by the arch fiend. Director
Roman Polonski uses this plot only
as the vehicle for cutting to shreds
his favorite whipping boy: the soph-
isticated, urbane mentality that smoth-
ers random imagination and stub-
bornly refuses to acknowledge the
possible existence of witches, war-
locks, the Devil, and, by extension,
a irrational God.

The Middle Class Devil

(save Rosemary) so that it is im-
poss.ble to identify them with ab-
solutes. Thus, there is not one char-
acter in the whole film who is
adequate as an evil being. Satan
for example, is no fallen angel; he

is such a thoroughly middle class
devil that rather than contribute to
the illegitimacy rate by choosing some
pure white virgin; he ravishes poor
Rosemary in a high-camp rape scene.
Rosemary herself, beautifully over-
done by Mia Farrow, is nevertheless
a highly synthetic little thing who
for a while evokes sympathy by
attempting to assert a sort of indi-
viduality. Her fear is compounded
because its source is not rooted in
any one individual (which would make
it easy to dispose of), but rather in
the very thought of a conspiracy.

Bittersweet End

Polonski creates suspense in this
situation by confusing us with rapid
jump cuts, obscure action, and in-
tensely detailed sets. To these techni-
cal aids he gleefully adds bits and
pieces of contemporary issues, such
as the God Is Dead theme, aimed at
derailing our cosmopolitan sense of
jreason and always keeping us off
| balance. The effect of the resolution
scene upon the evidence is similar
to that produced in a Marvin movie;
after drooling our way through ca-
tharsis our imaginations are reconciled
with the final action only because it
appears to be bittersweet reality. En-
lightenment costs more than a buck
and a half.

 

 

To the Editor:

Because of the recent E.C. deci-
sion on freshman and conventional
dress, the nature of WA&L’s dress code
needs to be brought into focus, Over
the years, the meaning of “conven-
tional” dress has undergone consid-
erable change. Twenty years ago,
vests were a required part of con-
ventional dress. Ten years ago,
trousers (as Opposed to slacks) were
not considered conventional. Four
years ago, blue and wheat jeans were
frowned upon. Perhaps, turtle neck
sweaters may replace the shirt and
tie as conventional,

Because of the rapidity of our
changing dress habits, the official
code of conventional dress has not

However, the real question that
needs to be raised is the necessity
for a prescribed dress code at all.
In a liberal arts institution which
WAL claims to be, a student should
be free to grasp new ideas, new
approaches, and new philosophies. A
student should have the academic and
personal freedom to find himself, to
be his own man, to experiment, to
reach his own conclusions.

Thus, the idea of a preseribed code
of dress (that tells you what to wear
and what not to wear) is repugnant
to the concept of liberal education

Leslie was pleased with the running
of junior halfback Joe Dozier, Bucky
Cunningham’s continued display of
his pass-catching abilities (five for 45

Dozier will get the starting nod
against Randolph-Macon. The full

Eaker Admonishes
Interfraternity Council
To Assume Responsibility

(Continued from Page 2)

I feel that the ideal project would
be a free school to which people in
the community could come in order
to continue their education or even
to begin it anew. Students and faculty
members could volunteer as instruc-
tors and administrators, and the fa
cilities of the University could be used
as classrooms. Courses in reading and
|writing could be given, well
instruction in other fields. This would
|serve the community and its people
jas well as giving the students an ex-
iperience in helping others.

This IFC could continue as in
the past and be merely and regula-
tory agency. or it could live up to
its responsibilities as the most pow-
erful organization on campus. By
becoming aware of the problems
that surround us the IFC can then
mobilize the resources, financial and
manpower, to do something about
those problems. If WAL is to turn
out interested and responsible citi-
zens, then the fraternities must lead
the way by becoming more than
just eating houses, Vraternities are
not the source of all evil, as some
people have claimed, but by the
same token, fraternities and the IFC
have failed to make truly valuable
contributions in the past. It should
be the common goal of each of
us to prevent this same failure in
the future.

“The way

I see it’

(Editor's note: “The way I see it”
is a column of general editorial
comment for which contributions
are solicited from students and
faculty concerning any topic. The
opinions expressed in this column
do not necessarily represent those
of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi.)

By JAY PASSAVANT
Student Body President

During my campaign last spring,
there was a good deal of interest
shown in my pro-
posal of a Wash-
ington and Lee-
Lexington Com-
munity “Big Broth-
er” system. In the
past, there has
been very little op-
portunity for any
interested students
to get out in the
local area and
meet face to face
the problem of our
underprivileged youth. The proposed
big-brother system, with its obvious
community relations advantages,
would offer any interested W&L men
a chance to come in contact with and
offer some help to a local boy who
for some reason or another has not
had an interest shown in him in his
family life.

After checking with Dr. Hodges of

 

the religion dept. I learned that
there was little hope in attaining as-
sistance through the National Big-
Brother Foundation. He suggested

that my best alternative was to work
through local channels rather than
national. Last week, after a discus-
sion with coach Verne Canfield, I
learned that the Lexington Boy's Club
had been put back on its feet and
was Open once again to Lexington
boys. Mr. Canfield reported that he
had been placed in charge of the
organization this past summer and
that he had been fortunate enough to
receive enough assistance,
and monetary, to re-organize
club.

For those who are not familiar
with the Boy's Club, it was estab-
lished about two years ago by Chuck
Beale, a former VMI Cadet and
local citizen, and Bob Brenner, a
1967 WAL graduate. These two men
organized the club, found a suitable
clubhouse on the outskirts of Lex-
ington. and proceded to carry most
of the burden for its operation. The
club is open to Lexington boys of
ages 4-15 and offers recreational fa-
cilities, sports equipment and guidance
by the counselors.

Mr. Canfield expressed a sincere
need for a group (15-20) of Wash-
ington and Lee men who would be
interested in serving as counselors or
big brothers to these Lexington boys.
The only requirement is a few hours
a week and a genuine desire to help
young boys. The time spent with these
boys is not only a lot of fun, but also
personally rewarding in many dif-
ferent ways.

Discrimination of girls’ housing
opposed by I.F.C. resolution

The IFC last night approved a
resolution deploring the apparent
discrimination in some of the ap-
proved Lexington housing for girls
from the surrounding schools. The
proposal introduced by IFC treasurer
Mark Eaker urged that the girls’
schools be made aware of the fact
that action be taken.

Dean Atwood said that this topic
was on the agenda of a meeting
planned for Wednesday between the
deans and student leaders of the sur-
rounding schools, and he questioned
the wisdom of the IFC’s timing on
this resolution feeling that it might
stir hasty action among the schools
in question.

The resolution states: “Resolved,
that the Interfraternity Council of
Washintgon and Lee University rec-
ognizes the fact that a large number
of licensed lodging houses in Lex-
ington practice racial discrimination
in extending hospitality to female
guests, and that many of these
houses are included on approved hous-
ing lists of the various female insti-
tutions of higher learning.”

“Be it further resolved that the
Interfraternity Council deplores the
above situation and recommends that
the institutions involved be made)
cognizant of the situation that exists |
in Lexington so that these institutions
may take whatever action that they
may deem necessary for its correct-
ion.”

In other action president Clark
Carter said that a copy of the “Book
of Knowledge” encylopedia had been
received by the IFC to be given to a
needy Lexington organization. Carter
said that the decision had been tenta-
tively reached to donate the encyclo-
pedia to the Lexington Boys’ Club.
Jay Passavant also noted that the EC
is supporting a program to involve
WAL students with the Lexington
youth through the Boys’ Club and
that there would be a meeting of all
those interested Wednesday evening
in the third floor of Washington Hall
at 8 p.m.

Dean Atwood noted that during the
summer the Lexington city council
had passed a stringent anti-noise ordi-
nance. He said that for the first

In reporting on the activities of
the Pension Committee, Mark Eaker
stated that he needed further informa-
tion before the insurance companies
he had contacted could give him esti-
mated costs of the pensions, Eaker
said that he needed the name, year of

nual earnings of all the fraternity
employees to be covered under the
plan.

IFC social chairman Dave Stovall
said that the deadline for submitting
the sketches for the Homecoming dis-
plays and pictures of the Homecom-
ing queen candidates was October 11.
He stated that this weekend was also

ley and that this should be kept in
mind when the fraternities planned

News analysis
By MARK EAKER

This past weekend a member of
the student body of a girl’s school in
this area was denied lodging at the
majority of the boarding houses in
Lexington. She came to Lexington in
order to date a member of the W&L
student body. As a result of this, on
Monday night the IFC adopted a
resolution recognizing and deploring
the existence of racial discrimination
on the part of hostesses in Lexing-
ton.

Within the IFC there was no dis-
sent as to the appropriateness of that
organization adopting the resolution,
nor concerning the wording of the
resolution. I do feel, however, that
some clarification is needed in order
that the student body as a whole will
understand why the resolution was
passed and why it reads the way it
does.

First, it is my belief and that of
the IFC that one of its functions
should be to protect the interests of
the fraternities and the members of
the fraternity system. Clearly the
availability of housing for dates of

Abolition of Saturday classes
will be considered by faculty

The special faculty committee ap-
pointed by President Huntley to con-|
sider the question of abolishing Sat- |
urday classes and establishing a|
five day academic week has pub-|
lished its report. The committee sub-|
mitted five different plans to the |
faculty for consideration. i

The committee, headed by Dr. |
Cook, includes Dr. Hamer, Dr. Me-|
Guire, and Dr. Royston. The com- |
mittee failed to endorse any specific
proposal, but the report stated that
a plan, basically similar to our ex-
isting schedule with the five extra
morning hours being put in the after- |
noon, had the most support among |
the members of the committee.

All five of the plans have shifted |
the class hours from the present
8:25-4:40 schedule to a schedule with |
classes at 8 a.m. and ending at 4 p.m. |
Of the five plans analyzed by the |
report only three of the plans had |
provisions for no Saturday classes.
One of these plans, which had no
support among the committee mem-
bers, was a variation of a plan pre-
sented by the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
last spring.

The remaining two plans do not
abolish Saturday classes but merely
reflect the shift of the class hours to
more early schedule. The plans
will be discussed at the October fac-
ulty meeting next Monday.

Attached to the report was a poll
of the faculty on questions relating to

A half million dollars: a news report

 

Saturday classes. Of the 87 faculty
members that replied to the poll, over
65 percent said that they favored a
five day week. Another question re-
vealed that over a majority of the
faculty members favored teaching in
the morning only.

Special meeting
for newspapermen

There will be a special one-hour
meeting on Monday, October 7 at 2
p.m. in the Ring-tum Phi office which
must be attended by all freshmen
and sophomores on the Tuesday staff.

The purpose of the meeting, spon-
sored by the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi,
is to acquaint the younger members
of the staff with journalism’s finer
points as they apply to the school
newspaper.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The Tuesday

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper
Tuesday, October 1, 1968

 

Some reflections on a very noteworthy address

We have encouraging indications from many sources
that Washington and Lee’s financial future

 

President Huntley said that since the late
1950s the University has concentrated on
human needs and that it now behooves Wash-
ington and Lee to so deal with its accumula-
tion of physical needs.

But his was no mere philosophical rhe-
toric; specifics were discussed with an air of
near-finality: no priorities will be assigned for
the construction of physical structures, as none
need be assigned; there will be no ‘trans-
formation by edict or fiat.”

Specific structures were mentioned. The
impression was given that nearly all the in-
adequate facilities on campus would be re-

Huntley Johnson’s admonition

In last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi a serious
though veiled admonition was made to the
fraternities by the IFC rush chairman and
head of the Deferred Rush Committee, Hunt-
ley Johnson. Mr. Johnson is concerned about
the likelihood (or near-certainty) of dirty
rush next year and urges the fraternities to
adopt a mutual pledge against it.

Although our “one step further” may
seem absurdly naive at first, we urge the
IFC to consider it in view of the past (dirty)
rush week and Mr. Johnson’s comments.

A considered plea to the faculty and administration

We are aghast after reading the report
to the faculty recently distributed by a com-
mittee appointed to study a five-day week. It
seems as though the committee is not only
discounting the opinion of a majority of both
students and faculty but is coming danger-
ously close to ignoring it.

Five plans are submitted by the commit-
tee of four for consideration by the faculty.
Two of the plans include Saturday classes,
and one of these extends some A through J
classes into the afternoon. Three of the plans
omit Saturday classes: two, one of which has
the most support on the committee, schedule
some A through J classes in the afternoon;
the third is one about which we have a few
words.

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi polled the stu-
dent body and the faculty last year, and in
the largest turnout ever on this campus 73
per cent of the students voting responded
favorably to the Lynchburg College plan of

A rare opportunity

Tomorrow Washington and Lee students
will have two occasions to hear what has been
described as “an enthralling if not inspiring
speech” by the late Liz herself, Gertrude
Behanna. Coming to Lexington after rigorous
and lengthy entreaties by Rev. Irving, Mrs.
Behanna will surely deliver an address not
to be missed.

Despite one’s religious convictions, it must
be admitted that any speaker who Feceives a
ten-minute standing ovation at Yale is at least
interesting and at best beyond adequate de-
scription,

About our photographs

This is an apology for the photographs
in the first issues of The Ring-tum Phi, which
at their best are not of as fine a quality as
most in last year’s papers. The fault is not
that of the photographers—who have done a
superb job—but that of Mr. Kessler and my-
self,

As reported in The Friday Ring-tum Phi,
the Publications Board purchased an engrav-
ing machine with which zine plates are made

In his tones of customary understatement, President Hunt-
ley indicated in an address to the University that Washington
and Lee is about to undergo a change, in somewhat more than
a minor way. For several months we have awaited word from
the super-secret Office of University Development—there have
been no few intimations of massive, concrete proposals soon
to emanate from the project. It now seems as though the
revelation of a Master Plan is imminent, a plan which will
involve millions of dollars and a substantial set of assets for
Washington and Lee.

Ring-tum Phi

will not be bleak.
—President Robert E. R. Huntley
Opening Assembly, September 18, 1968

placed or repaired extensively. It doesn’t re-
quire a great deal of thought to imagine what
effect a new gymnasium would have on the
athletic program, a new theatre on the fine
arts program, an increase in the library’s
capacity and renovation in Tucker and New-
comb Halls on the school’s academic and
research stature.

Perhaps a package deal with adequate,
comfortable dormitories in which all students
would live. The future of Washington and
Lee and its stake in greatness among Ameti-
can colleges are being scrutinized and pro-
jected. We await further indications with
profound interest.

and a step further

If every fraternity is allowed to say what-
ever it pleases to rushees, what harm can be
done in the ultimate results at the end of
the first semester? We believe none, save dis-
respect in the eyes of the rushees for those
fraternities which dirty rush.

Next year’s rush will be at least sixteen
times as long as past years’, giving rushees
ample opportunity to decide for themselves
the validity of dirty rush statements as well
as to ponder the worthiness and motives of a
fraternity that resorts to such tactics.

morning only Monday through Friday classes.
In fact, only 9 per cent of the students who},
voted and 45 per cent of the faculty who
voted favored afternoon classes. And in a
poll of the faculty recently taken by the com-
mittee only 35 per cent expressed a desire
for afternoon classes.

What is even more confounding is that
the committee did not present the Lynchburg /
Ring-tum Phi plan in its report, but rather
a version of it—a version which is so poor
a copy that it necessitates 20 extra school days
in the year. As originally proposed, this would
not be the case.

We will make no hasty accusations, but
it bewilders us that the committee acted as
though it were an entity unto itself, unre- |
sponsive to the clearly expressed will of the
majority. Our sincerest plea is made to the
faculty and administration to weigh the ques-
tion of Saturday and afternoon classes more
judiciously than did the committee.

previous annual payments for this service. Un-
fortunately, technique is not for sale; and
until such time as we two editors have mastered

indulgence.

To the parents

The Ring-tum Phi has made a profit very
few years in its history. The paper's budget is
not the most flexible we've seen, so in order
to save (and make) money, the editors have
two solutions this year.

The first is the purchase of a Photo-Lathe
engraver, described above, which should save
$1,500 per year after this year until the mid-
1970s. The second is to solicit subscriptions
from the parents of students.

We do not intend to harangue about how
valuable it is to you to receive The Ring-tum
Phi, as you may judge for yourself from
these first four free issues, But in case some
of you can’t quite decide, we'll close by say-
ing that the editors are paid a paltry salary
indeed but one whose size is a percentage of

 

Foreign study excites students —

By TOM GILLESPIE

As the old cliche goes, “foreign
travel is broadening” and if this be
true, foreign study can be doubly so,
Realizing this, the Washington and
Lee Foreign Study Committee lends
every effort to help interested students
study abroad for a year, a semester,
or maybe just for the summer and
receive up to 12 semester hours of
credit for their work.

Although W&L does not have its
own foreign study program, Dr. David
Dickens, chairman of the Foreign
Study Committee, has explained that
there are numerous possibilities for
study abroad in almost every field of
interest.

Dr. Dickens stated, “the commit-
tee wants foreign study to be more
than the private reserve of language
majors as previously believed.” For
example, some programs (particularly

in Holland, Scandinavia, and the
Orient) are built around English-

language instruction.

Any W&L student considering study
abroad should plan ahead even as
early as the freshman year. A cumu-
lative GPR of 2.5 (through the sopho-
more year) is required and a student
will find it difficult to raise his aver-
age at the last moment,

When the decision is made to at-
tempt to study abroad, the procedure
is relatively simple. To begin, the
prospective applicant should study the
available programs and with the help
of the committee or of a language
professor decide which programs are
best suited to his individual interest.

Foreign study programs vary great-
ly in respect to the quality of instruc-
tion, living accommodations, trans-
portation to and from the foreign
country, subjects offered, and dura-
tion of study.

The prospective applicant should
make a formal application to the
Foreign Study Committee. If the ap-
plicant meets the university's require-
ments and has a written note from
his parents giving their consent, he
will receive the endorsement of the
committee. The applicant then needs
only to apply to the program that
he has decided upon.

In considering the financial aspect
of foreign study the student should
know that a year’s study in a foreign
country is usually comparable to a
year at W&L, sometimes less.

Clint Murchinson and Larry
Boetsch, two WAL students, spent
last year in Spain studying in Mary
Baldwin's “Year in Madrid” program.

 

__Murchison reports that the courses

were “extremely demanding but I feel
that I'm learning more than ever be-
fore in my life... without a doubt
the most valuable experience of my
life.” Boetsch comments, “I have that
wonderful feeling of really having
learned something last year.”

“Each day continued to be a brand-
new experience, and the whole pro-
gram turned out even better than |
had hoped.” However, both men la-

ment the fact that there were so many

 

more female participants than male, |

The student participating in a
foreign study program is administra-
tively no longer considered a W&L
student so far as draft classification
goes. However, the institution which
administers the program certifies the
participant as a full time student
at that school,

Grades and credit for work done
abroad are normally transferred back

Yow acclaims superb portrayals
in bewitching ‘Rosemary’s Baby’

By JOHN YOW
Critic

Today one is immediately suspici-
ous of movies of suspense and/or
movies dealing with the supernatural.
These genres are
decidedly not a la
mode in this day
of the avant-garde
and the artsy-
craftsy. Don't mis-
read me—the “new
wave” films com-
ing from Poland,
Czechosio va kia
and France are not
only necessary but
very often quite)
good. However the

think that I thereby reduced the
film’s potential from my own stand-
point. Not only did I fail to un-
cover any gaping flaws but I was
quite favorably impressed with this
film in virtually every respect.
The film is a William Castle pro-
duction and is taken from Ira Levin's
recent novel by the same name to
which it remains quite faithful. The
story tells of Rosemary (Mia Far-

to produce a future king from the

He is replacing Dr. Sterling Boyd as
associate professor of Art History.

Married with three children, Dr.
Doyon graduated from St. Anselm's
College with an A.B. and received
his Masters and his Ph.D. from Bos-
ton University. He has spent many
years in France studying the numer-
ous artifacts, adding personal experi-
ence to his classroom learning.

During World War Hl Dr. Doyon
was associated with the 3d Army in
France as an interpreter and worked
with the French underground for most
of the war. His principal duty was to
find out where French prisoners were
being held captive. In this process
Dr. Doyon saved the lives of hun-
dreds of soldiers. For his heroic deeds
he received a Bronze Star from the
United States and the Croix de Guerre
from France.

Returning from the war, Dr. Doyon
completed his education and was ap-
pointed to the chairmanship of the
Fine Arts Department at his Alma

Generals return to ther own kind—
they hope—this Saturday when they
face Centre College in Danville, Ky.

The Colonels, in a rebuilding year,
are 0-2 for the season, and so is
WAL after losses to strong Guilford
and Randloph-Macon.

“Centre should be more on our
level,” W&L coach Buck Leslie com-
mented, “but that’s not meant to
downgrade them. They have a good
team, it's a conference game and it’s
their Homecoming, so they'll be up
for us.”

Centre has lost its entire starting
backfield and three starting offensive
linemen from last year’s 7-2 squad
which tied W&L and Washington of
St. Louis for second place in the
College Athletic Conference. Includ-

ed in the losses was a 6-0 setback by|

W&L.
Gone are quarterback Joe La-
Monica and halfback Ben Boone, but

 

Washington and Lee’s soccer team
began living up to its potential on
Friday, beating Pfeiffer College 4-2.
This evened the General's record at
1-1, and put an end to any doubts
about this year’s team.

Blue controlled the game. Pfeiffer
lacked enough individual stars, and
their teamwork wasn’t anywhere near
the equal of the home team’s. The
one saving grace they had was their
goalie, Benny Clodfelter, who man-
aged to keep the Generals down to
one goal for the first half.

Scott Fechnay scored all four goals
for W&L in another brilliant per-
formance. The Generals have played
in two game so far, accumulating
seven goals. Of those seven, four
have been scored by Fechnay.

But Friday's game was hardly a
one-man effort. Jack Horowitz, Thom

Plagued by injuries early in the

unusually large crowd turned out to
cheer for the J.V.’s, and while the
results must have disappointed them,

ceptions, despite the lopsided score.

an injured knee, put on a fine dis-
play of ball control, as well as play-
ing excellent man-to-man defense. He
had a difficult time keeping up the
pace, however, and had to be rested
toward the end of the first half.
Further conditioning should cure that.

The game started off quickly
enough as Fechnay surprised the visi-
tors with a goal on a pass from
Horowitz. After the initial shock, the
Blue kept on applying a constant pres-
sure. On one play, there was heavy
fighting around the Pfeiffer goal when
the goalie fumbled the ball. Fechnay,
lying on the ground in front of the
goalmouth, just managed to get a
leg into the ball with an open net
in front of him. But Horowitz just
then slipped and blocked the shot.
Although they were clearly in com-
mand of the game, the Blue just
couldn't score.

Finally, as the half was about to

(Continued on Page 4)

but as the quarter was about to end,
SMA intercepted a WA&L pass and
ran it back for a touchdown. The
same thing happened again in the
second quarter, and so as the half
ended, the Brigadiers were trailing by
14-0. Injuries to Scott Gibbs at half-
back and Ray Royce at fullback were
hurting the Blue's already thin back-
field.

In the third quarter, the vistors
were still unable to dent the W&L

ball away from SMA on downs on
their own 4-yard line. But on the
first play from scrimmage, the Blue
fumbled and recovered in their own
end zone, giving their opponents a
two point safety. Another touchdown
in the fourth quarter ended the scor-
ing.

Coach Poudrier was very pleased
with the team's overall showing, how-
ever. “The defensive team did a really
fine job, and the offense when it
finally got moving, looked good too.
This was probably the toughest game
we'll have for the rest of the year.”

away game against Massanutten Mili-
tary Academy this Friday, and will

Schenz, the CAC’s leading scorer with
60 points last year, and end Doug
Eaton, the Colonels’ leading pass re-
ceiver.

Schenz has been hurt but is re-
ported to be well and ready to go
against the Generals.

“We get all the breaks,” was Coach
Leslie’s comment.

Although outscored 45-21 by Ran-
dolph-Macon’s powerful Yellow Jack-
ets last Saturday, W&L may have
found the offense it has been looking
for in the passing of Jack Baizley
and the running-passing ability of
Chuck Kuhn.

Baizley hit 11 of 21 against Macon
for 177 yards and two touchdowns.
Kuhn hit 3 of 6, including the other
touchdown, and ran well.

Pass receiver Bucky Cunningham
played his second straight fine game,
grabbing nine passes for 139 yards
and two TD’s. End Steve Mahaffey

 

snagged five for 47 yards and one
score, and did an excellent job cover-
ing on punts.

Of Randolph-Macon, Coach Leslie
said “We played a good team, a
strong team. When you boil every-
thing down, the difference was
Howard Stevens.”

Indeed he was. The shifty little
Yellow Jacket halfback ran by the
W&L defense for 113 yards, caught
three passes for another 75 yards
scored two touchdowns and set up
several other scores. And he’s just a
freshman.

After two very tough games, the
bugaboo Leslie feared the most—in-
juries—have begun to emerge. Two
starters, halfback Luke Crosland and
linebacker and co-captain John Wolf
have banged-up knees and will sit
out the Centre game. Several other
key players are nursing severe bruises
and sprains and will not be up to
full effectivness if they are able to
play at all.

; Sounding off...

By ROY CARLTON
Sports Editor

In late November, as the football
season draws to a close, Army will
play Navy, Duke will play UNC,
and Georgia will play Georgia Tech.
But who will Washington and Lee
play? Washington University? That
hardly seems like a contest to match
the other three.

And so it has always been, and
so it probably always will be. W&L
hasn't had a serious arch-rival since
1953, when last it played big-time
football. Then it was Virginia, and
a more deadly rivalry you couldn't
imagine. It seemed almost fitting that
two schools which compete so in-
tensely, academically and socially,
should do the same on the gridiron.
Although the Wahoos usually won,
that never seemed to mattter to the
die-hard Minks. Every once in a while
they'd get their revenge by pounding
the Cavaliers into the dust.

In 1954 subsidized football vanish-
ed from W&L, and when the new age
of amatuer football was born in 1955,
the Generals were no longer a match
for the boys from Charlottesville.
They played an entirely new schedule
now with teams they had never heard
ot before. Nothing has ever replaced
the Wahoos.

From all the teams that the Gen-
erals have been playing in the past

.| decade, the university administration

and the athletic department have
selected two around which to build
a rivalry. Correctly, they have real-
ized that a strong rivalry solidifies
the bonds of the student to his school
and to his fellow student. But their
approach has been wrong.

The university has chosen Wash-
ington U. and Sewanee. And that is
the problem. Because of the similarity
in names, it would seem obvious to
start up a rivalry with Washington
U. And so annually, Washington is
the last team that the Generals play.
But how can a vibrant rivalry be
maintained with a team hundreds of
miles away? That's the reason no-
body gets exicited when the Bears
come to play.

Sewanee is a more logical choice.
It was chosen because of its many
common philosophies with WAL. It
is a conservative southern-oriented
liberal arts institution for gentlemen.
With alternating homecomings appear-
ances, this rivalry has, in recent
years, started to achieve a degree of
reality. But this year, the Purple
Tigers are coming to Lexington for
Parents’ weekend, An occasion that is
somewhat less than the emotion pack-
ed Homecomings. Another thing
which has always been holding this
rivalry down, is that it is confined
to football alone. The only
times the two schools meet
tournament draws which,

other |

Generals need a good rivalry

sports, are quite irregular.

The solution to the problem (make
no mistake, this is a problem) is ob-
vious. With one or two exceptions,
the great rivalries are based on geo-
graphical factors. In Lexington, there
lie the makings of an unbeatable
rivalry: W&L and VMI.

On the surface, this idea sounds
utterly absurd. W&L abandoned
athletic subsidies completely, even
years ago. The VMI scholarship pro-
gram is quite healthy. Yet the dif-
ferences between the two school’s
athletic programs are not really so
remote. Just look at the General's
athletic schedules.

Last year, the Big Blue basketball
team played its first major college
opponent in ten years, East Carolina
U. ECU is in the same conference
as the Keydets, and fields hoop teams
of relatively the same calibre. This
year W&L’s basketball team will face
Navy, Guilford, and Elon (the last
two were ranked in the top twenty
national small colleges last year).
While the Generals may very well lose
all three of those games, is VMI any

better than them? It’s probably quite
a bit worse.

Football would probably seem the
biggest mismatch. So here some kind
of an annual scrimmage could be
set up. And yet, with that typical
optimism that seems to be creeping
into the W&L scheduling, the Gen-
erals are set to play Yale in the
Yale Bowl in 1970. Don’t try to say
the Ivies are all that bad. VMI foot-
ball has been pretty sad in recent
years and Princeton was thirteenth in
the nation not too long ago.

Some may say that such a rivalry
would get out of hand, and that it
would be detrimental to the co-opera-
tion between the two schools. But
such co-operation is only nominal,
this at least would bring the schools
into contact. If it’s true that the
rivalry would get too fierce, why not
have football and basketball scrim-

mages. There always used to be
competition in the other sports, let's
bring it back.

Give us a rival.

would hope the EC has a similar
attitude towards the student body and
will take some action in regards to
this matter.)

As for the wording of the resolu-
tion, its meaning should be clear.
The IFC is not seeking to place any
blame upon individuals or institutions
but rather to find a quick solution to
a disturbing and important problem.
This resolution will be presented to
the girls’ schools in the area in hopes
that they will take appropriate cor-
rective action.

appropriate department heads and

end, Pfeiffer managed to get their
first real attack going. Captain Bob
Parry scored unassisted on a screen
shot.

When the second half opened, the
Generals took their revenge. After
being blocked on a feed from Hiatt,
Fechnay converted a pass from Yow
to give the lead back to W&L. Mo-
ments later, Fechnay scored his third
on the most beautiful effort of the
day.

Taking the ball around mid-field,
he dribbled around two defenders to
go in on a one-on-one. The shot,
taken from a sharp angle to the right,
just cut the edge of the net, as the
goalie never had a chance.

EC Discusses
New Schedules,
Plans For Year

At the Executive Committee meet-
ing last Tuesday night Student Body
President Jay Passavant called for
reports from the Student Control
Committee, the Curriculum Commit-
tee, the Cold Check Committee, and
the Assimilation Committee, all stu-
dent organizations,

Ray Hartzwell, chairman of the
Student Control Committee, said thus
far his committee had encountered
“no problems.” Hartwell said that
conventional dress in Evans Hall will
be strictly enforced this year. The
nine-member committee will meet
every Thursday night, and Hartwell
announced that when the freshman
class president is elected he will attend
the meetings.

Curriculum Committee Chairman
Swede Henberg indicated that the
W&L-Randolph-Macon seminar will
begin about Oct. 14. Henberg stated
that the seminar will be limited to
only 12 from each school yet any-
one from the student body may apply.
The students from Randolph-Macon
participating in the seminar will re-
ceive one hour credit; however, WAL
students will receive no credit.

Henberg also told EC members
that the Curriculum Committee would
strive this year to effect changes in
degree requirements and courses, some
of which he termed as being “out-
dated by 20 years.”

Glenn Moore, chairman of the Cold
Check Committee, informed the EC
that this year his committee would
send postcards as a warning to stu-
dents who have overdue accounts |
with local merchants. Moore said
that there would be a definite fine
scale for those students who fail to
respond to the postcards. Moore also
said that a letter would be circulated |
to all freshmen on Oct. 7 explaining
to them the nature of the Cold Check
Committee. The nine-member group
will meet every Thursday in Evans
Dining Hall at 6:45 p.m.

Last to report was Mike Pustay of
the Assimilation Commitiee who
spoke to the EC concerning the pep
rally to be held Oct. 18 in Red
Square at 7:00 p.m. Pustay said his
committee will work in conjunction
with the Varsity Club in the prepara-
tions. The EC voted the commitice
$375 which will be used to purchase
beer for the pep rally. The Assimila-
tion Committee will visit with fresh-
men in the dorms at 10:00 p.m. Oct.
7,

After the four committee reports,

mons reported on the meeting of the |

ernments which he attended in ¢ har- |

In last Tuesday's edition of the
Ring-tum Phi, a resolution by IFC
treasurer Mark Eaker was made pub-
lic. This resolution stated that the
IFC was aware of the fact that
racial discrimination was prevalent in
a large number of the licensed lodg-
ing houses in Lexington. Deploring
| this fact, the resolution suggests that
the surrounding schools take “what-
| ever action that they may deem neces-

Troubs To Give

‘Exit the King’

Under The Direction Of Clinard

Washington and Lee's Troubadour

began rehearsals Wednesday night for
their production of Eugene lonesco’s
“Exit the King,” a presentation to
be directed by a WAL graduate, Noel
Clinard.

Clinard was a member of the Class |

of 1968. While at Washington and
Lee, he was a member of Beta Theta
| Pi social fraternity and of Phi Beta

Who's Who in the American Col-

Ring-tum Phi Poll Traces
Discrimination In Lodging

that had existed previous to this year.

| Since they have no choice in the
girl's housing they cannot make de-
mands upon the hostess.

A solution to the problem has al-
ready been undertaken. The Friday
Ring-tum Phi conducted a telephone
survey among the hostesses last week
to determine whether or not they
‘would discriminate among the girls.
This list is being compiled and will
be presented to the IFC Monday
night. It will in turn be made avail-
able to the students of Washington
and Lee. Hollins College and Sweet-
briar College have similar lists which
they make available to their students.
By providing these lists a part of the
problem will be alleviated, it is hoped.

There has been talk of a possible
boycott against those hostesses who
practice discrimination, but consid-
ering the general attitude of the stu-
dent body, it is predicted such a
move would be unsuccessful.

Not An Ideal Situation’S

The results of the telephone poll (which appears on this
page) to licensed lodging homes in Lexington are quite sur-
prising. Twenty-five of the 52 contacts definitely stated they
would not or could not allow black students to stay in their
homes. Before we had decided to conduct this survey, we had
anticipated that many more would reject Negroes.

This is not to say that an ideal situation exists in Lexington.

Far from it. All of these homes should take in any students
without regard for race, creed or color. However, in spite ot
the fact these places are licensed by a state agency, there are
no laws—state or federal—which could force these homes to
keep Negroes. (Laws requiring integration of public lodging
homes deal with concerns larger than those in Lexington.)

At the same time the Ring-tum Phi does not feel that it
is our duty to try to impose (even if we could) integration on
these lodging homes. What we feel the Ring-tum Phi should
do is to inform the student bodies of this university and the
others concerned what the situation is. The best way to do
this we felt was to publish a list of the women who would keep
Negroes and those who would not. This would let Negro|-
students know where they are welcome.

Reflection on this matter led us to conclude that a pub-
lished list could have adverse affects. First, it might put some
of these women who will accept Negroes in an embarrassing
position within the community. To us this seems absurd and
should not even occupy our thoughts. But the fact remains
that Lexington is a closely-knit social community, often highly
critical of those who do not want to retain traditional beliefs
and customs. We felt that our whole purpose of opening up
homes might be hurt if some of the women changed their
minds and closed their homes when their names appeared in
print. In addition, others who might be considering opening
their homes to Negroes might dislike this tactic so much they
would remain closed.

Second, and more important, there are groups in this area
which might terrorize and intimidate the women who welcome
Negroes.

To keep this list from falling into the wrong hands we will
turn it over the Interfraternity Council so that this body may
make it available to the neighboring girls’ schools. The girls’
schools could use this list as they see fit, even to the extent of
boycotting the places that will not accept Negroes.

For our part, we believe that the Washington and Lee stu-
dent body should cooperate in this effort by asking their dates
not to stay in segregated housing. Only in this way will the
situation be rectified.

Plan A--Best For W&L

The first faculty meeting of the year is scheduled on Mon-
day. With it comes the inevitable “busywork” which must be
cleared up before the faculty can discuss more important mat-
ters. The most important matter they will bring up is the
formulation of a five-day week.

Plan A (see diagram on this page) is the most advantage-
ous for Washington and Lee. Besides being the one which we
can switch to (hopefully next semester) with the least number
of complications, there will be no conflict with classroom space,
and afternoon classes will meet only twice a week—on Monday
and Thursday. In addition, this plan is flexible enough to
enable courses to meet for longer periods and leaves many
possibilities for adding new courses to the curriculum with a
minimum of conflicts.

A decision will not be made at Monday’s meeting. Instead,
the faculty will probably schedule a special meeting and dis-
solve into a committee-of-the-whole to discuss the plans. We
urge the f faculty to decide as soon as possible which five- day
plan is best suited to the W&L campus. It has long
overdue.

Open Housing: Responsibility Of Students

ing here if we took colored.”

These women are providing a ser-
vice to the school community, and
}as such have a responsibility to pro-
| vide that service equally and fairly to
all who are willing to pay, Randolph-
Macon and the other girls’ schools
also have a_ responsibility to their
students to make sure that they do
not do anything to encourage such a
disgraceful and undignified treatment
of any of its students. It is this re-
sponsibility which the administrations
of these schools have so neatly and
quietly abrogated by what is known
as “passing the buck.”

By abolition of an approved hous-
ing list, the schools have lost by
default their position to apply the
pressure of a threat of removal from
the approved housing list any house
which discriminates against its stu-
dents because of race. The administra-
tions have thus quietly and neatly
washed their hands of the responsi-
bility. It is now up to the student
bodies of the girls’ schools to apply
the only leverage they can. I firmly
believe that tangible results would be

End Saturday Classes:

The Top Three Proposals

This Monday the faculty will meet
to discuss proposed plans for a five-
day week, Last spring, a committee
was appointed to consider the aboli-
tion of Saturday classes and to
present the faculty with their feel-
ings. The result of the deliberations
of this committee was a report to the
faculty which contained five plans
lettered A through E.

Plans A, B, and C meet the two
requirements of the resolution by
the faculty: Monday through Friday
classes from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. Plans
D and E fulfill only the 8 a.m. to
4 p.m. requirement.

Ihe committee's report stated
it was unable to agree on any
of the five plans presented, but tak
ing both first and second choices into
consideration, plan A had more sup
port by the group than the other
four plans. The report went on to
state that it gave no support to
plan C, which was a modification of
the “Lynchburg” plan, which the
Ring-tum Phi presented last year

The three plans illustrated to the

Each plan features the abolition of
Saturday but differ in the
hours and arrangement of class time
during the week.

Plan A

Plan A schedules classes to begin
at 8 am. and end at 4 p.m. and
includes a SO0-minute lunch period
and a five-minute break between
classes. This plan is somewhat similar
to our present plan of class schedul-
ing and would involve little adjust-
ment by the students and faculty. It
also includes a larger number of
periods for scheduling courses com-
pared to the other plans under con-
sideration, thereby providing a wider
field of choice of courses without con-

classes,

flict by students. Compared to the

comment for which contributions
are solicited from students and

By REED BYRUM
Managing Editor

The IFC last night continued to
promote its traditional reputation of
ludicrous absurdity and apathetic in-
activity in its pre-
sentation of its de-
fered rush plan.

As was bDlat-
antly admitted by
President Clark
Carter, this pro-
posal represents
only a_philosophi-
cal view of defer-
red rush, purposed
by the attempt to
satiate the almost
rabid desires of the faculty for a
change in rushing; he stated that the
practical part of this plan would be
worked out later.

Yet,
ous that the impotent Deferred Rush
Committee has taken 15 months al-
ready to formulate this impractical
and unrealistic program. In addition
to its lack of application to a realistic
situation, the present proposal reeks
with haziness, superficiality, and in-
justice; one can only presume that the
Deferred Rush Committee in its ulti-
mate lack of insight in the future
crystallization of this plan has been
completely vain and worthless.

 

Perhaps the most inapplicable and
nebulous section of the plan is the
part concerning no contact. This sec-
tion in particular exemplified the
phantasmagoric buffoonery of the en-
tire proposal. The IFC conceivably

Some fifty students will represent
the entire student body at the inau-
guration of President Robert E. R.
Huntley. They were chosen from the
upper classmen who are the leaders
of the student body. Freshmen were
not selected because they had not
yet had the opportunity to show their
qualities as student leaders. Both fra-
ternity and non-fraternity men were
chosen.

Student representatives will partici-
pate in the academic procession. They
will assemble on the second floor of

will march with the other members
of the procession and will sit in the

by the students in the inaugural pro-

fraternity will be the ushers for the
concert on Thursday evening at 7:45;
other students will act as ushers for
the seating of the guests at the inau-
gural ceremony at 11 a.m. on Friday.

The Brass Choir will play for the
procession and other students will
assist both the Inaugural Committee
in directing visitors around the
campus and as assistants to the fac-
ulty marshals in preparing for the
procession, Even further student par-
ticipation is being planned.

Finally, the Inaugural Committee
hopes that the student body will par-
ticipate by attending the inaugural
ceremony.

Because of the tight parking situa-
tion around the University, however,
students are requested by Dr. Leon

rationa Committee, to refrain from

bringing cars to the campus on Thurs- |

*“Freshman of the Year,”

The IFC’s deferred rush proposal
was introduced for the first time last
night to the member of the fraterni-
ties. After lengthy debate it became
apparent that there was still much
work to be done on the proposal.
Early in the debate a motion was
passed which stated that the first
vote on the measure, which was
planned for last night, should be
postponed until next Monday to fa-
cilitate further discussion.

Mark Eaker introduced another
motion concerning discrimination in
the Lexington housing of girls. It
stated that the IFC should compile
a list of those boarding houses that
would be willing to take Negro
women, publish and advertise that
list in Lexington and at the surround-
ing girls’ schools, and urge that all
girls to patronize those houses on the
approved IFC list. This motion car-
ried with ease.

The IFC elected Joe Tompkins the
an award
usually given in the spring but which
had been omitted in the last two years
through oversight. Tompkins, a SPE
from Vinton, Virginia, was the fresh-
man Executive Committee representa-
tive as well as a member of Phi
Eta Sigma, the Glee Club, and the
Young Republicans.

Clark Carter, IFC president, re-
ported that the IFC’s Contact pro-
gram was beginning to take shape
and that the tentative topic was
“Power: Student, Foreign, Economic,
Scientific, and Black.” Several invita-
tions have been given to prominent
political figures, but they were hesi-
tant to make any commitments until
after the November election results.

The discussion over the 21 articles
of the deferred rush plan was rela-
tively aimless, but it did point out
the definite need for a thorough and
careful study of the plan. Carter
introduced the proposal saying to his
knowledge this was the best provision
the IFC could offer in light of the
intent of the faculty with maximum
fairness to all fraternities.

The provisions relating to the com-
plete outlawing of summer rush and
rush publications brought criticism
from several houses. They felt that
| summer rush would ideally serve as

 

'an orienting factor that would have
no ultimate influence on the final

| decisions of the freshman. Suporters

ingly ridiculous idea of denying a
freshman an automobile ride home
and forcing him to tarvel in another
manner even if the fraternity active
was his older brother,

Much of the discussion centered
around the contact provisions. Sec-
tion 1 of the measure states: “There
will be no contact between fraternity
men and prospective rushees except
when specified. Rushees may at no
time visit the lodgings of an upper-
classmen who is a fraternity member
with the exception of the dorm
counselors in the dorms.”

The consensus of the IFC quickly
became that this section should be
reworded positively to indicate when
contact would be legal. The co-op,
the student union building, the Hill,
and the athletic fields would all be
areas where no contact would be
unenforceable and ridiculous; there-
fore contact is permissable in these
areas,

The transition from the fraternity
smokers during the first semester to
the post-exam rush dates appeared to
be another rough spot and a more
concrete proposal will, it seems, have
to be written.

Dean Atwood stated during the
debate that the no contact during
weekends was clearly the decision of
the fraternities; the faculty was not
forcing them to make this decision,
and, in fact, he believed that to the

News analysis

By REEVE KELSEY

Who is responsible for the social
life of the freshman class—the fra-
ternities or the University? This ques-
tion forms the underlying issue faced
by the IFC in their discussion of the
deferred rush proposal last night.
The IFC can not hedge this issue
in making a decision or the result
could very well be a completely un-
workable plan.

The existing proposal answers this
question emphatically—it is the Uni-
versity’s responsibility for the social
life of the freshmen until they pledge
a fraternity. They basically reason
that if they are deprived of about
$125 in revenue per man in their
pledge class for the first semester,
then they have no obligation or re-
sponsibility toward providing for the
social needs of the freshmen.

The supporters of the existing plan
feel that social contact on combo
weekends would lead to combo and
social “escalation” which could easily
result in intense pressure on the fra-
ternities to increase their social bud-
gets with the corresponding decreased
base of income during the first se-
mester.

process given material, while the new
one will not only be able to process
but also recall stored material.

The replacement of the 1620 with
the 1130 will mean that the computer

learn to program the new computer,

Abolish Saturday classes
but leave afternoons open

By ROBERT YEVICH
Editorial-PageEditor

Tuesday, October 8, 1968

—~-—-+- —

That the students and faculty of this university are in favor of a five-
day class week is unquestionable, However, the architecture of such a week
has become a matter of apparent controversy.

In the spring of last year, a poll conducted by The Tuesday Ring-tum
Phi indicated that 73 per cent of the students voting preferred a plan of
morning only Monday through Friday classes. In this same poll only 9
per cent of the students who voted and 45 per cent of the faculty who
voted showed a preference for afternoon classes.

In a recent poll of the faculty taken by the faculty committee appointed
: study a five-day week, only 35 per cent responded in favor of afternoon
classes.

In spite of the results of these polls, none of the five plans submitted

by the committee in their report to the faculty offers a schedule without
the drudgery of afternoon or Saturday classes.
“ Last year The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi presented a five-day class block
which, I believe, most adequately subscribes to the expressed desires of the
' majority of the members of the university community. This plan could be
aa implemented with much greater facility than any of the plans proposed
in the committee’s report.

Of the five plans offered in the report,
issue of abolishing Saturday classes. While the remaining plans present a
five-day week, they also call for afternoon classes.

The “Lynchburg” plan presented in the Ring-tum Phi last year features
no classes on Saturday or in the afternoon. Classes would meet for one
hour with a five minute break between them. The class day would begin at
8:00 a.m. and end at 1:20 p.m. The classes which meet now on a particular
day would still meet on the same day; that is, a regular day would be hours
A.C,E,G,I or B,D,F,H,J. The major alteration is that classes would meet

Hila

Freshmen entering Washington and Lee in September of
next year will at best have a dreary first semester if some
reason is not written into the deferred rush regulations. It is
very pleasing that the proposals before the IFC offer contact
at all, but the extent falls far short of what is needed.

Granted, it would be unfair to some of the more removed
fraternity houses were rushees allowed to house-hop at will.
Granted the student union will be a wonderful place. But
that’s all we will grant.

Imagine spending Openings, Homecoming, and other
fall weekends in a crowded building where only beer—3.2 at

necessary for programs of this sort
in the future. Unfortunately, nothing

that—is allowed, where privacy is impossible, where only |

freshmen will congregate.

Perhaps some on the IFC would have the faculty imagine
—and witness next year—these things and others just as un-
delectable in the delightful hope that conventional rush will
be returned on a tarnished silver platter, garnished with

chagrin.

Careful consultation with faculty oracles confirms that this
will not be the case. Whether the IFC or the faculty must
revise deferred rush is at this point up to the IFC. May we
not have to derive experience from folly.

“Campus Comments “

Following the lead of successes
such as “Blow-Up,” “A Man and a
Woman” and “The Graduate,” movie-
makers are using the camera to tell
the story.

Many “photographic essays” which
formerly would have been shown in
“art” theaters are now being turned
out for general public consumption.

But often the public is being “had,”
as in the case of “Elvira Madigan”
in which brilliant photography is not
enough to sell the show, This addition
to the film world fails to live up to
its predecessors in the art of cinema.

“Elvira Madigan” exhibits neither
the controversial “pornography” and
questionable symbolism of “Blow-Up”
nor the appeal of “The Graduate”
to the younger generation and its
rebellion against the hypocrisy of The
Establishment.

Lacking the sincerity and honesty
of love which sustained the beauty
of “A Man and a Woman,” the film
has nothing in originality to recom-
mend itself,

Photography is its only ploy. But

Study report of 1964-1966.

Parsons became acquainted with
the development problem as Secretary
of the Self-Study Committee: the
Visiting Committee, cognizant of the
need for long-range coordination and
planning, made firm recommendations
in this regard.

Acting on this advice in the fall
of 1966, President Cole created the
Office of University Development
and named Frank Parsons director.
It was by no means a sudden transi-
tion as Parsons continued for a time
in his old capacities.

It was not long afterwards, though,
that the pieces of a six-year dormant
office had to be picked up and put
together. While struggling to over-
come inexperience in designing a
blueprint, Parsons found himself be-
tween Scylla and Charybdis after
Cole's resignation and during the sub-
sequent period prior to the selection
of a new president.

Direction was not long in coming.

If simplicity of plot may some-

the film abounds with beautiful pic-

The transition to this plan would entail few complications as it is al-
most identical to our current class block system.

Most students object to the “Lynchburg” plan because they would have
to get out of bed a half hour earlier. However, the three alternative plans
which the faculty is likely to review in greatest detail schedule classes to
begin at either 8:00 or 8:15 a.m. and recall that those plans offer the added
attraction of afternoon classes. One of those plans, the University of Vir-
ginia plan, requires seventy-five minute class periods on Tuesday and

Thursday.

While the “Lynchburg” plan certainly has its deficiencies, I feel that
it offers the solution best suited to Washington and Lee. There will be no
increased conflict in classroom space. There will be no Saturday or after-
noon classes. Classes will only be ten minutes longer than they are now.
I feel that the faculty should bear these considerations in mind when the

issue is put to a vote.

An independent commission that
was formed to investigate the dis-
turbances on the Columbia University
campus last spring came to very
similar conclusions about the nature
of student unrest. As reported by the
N. Y. Times, Sunday, Oct. 6, 1968:
The student rebellion at Columbia
University gained ‘wide and deep
support’ largely because of a ‘deep-
seated and relatively unfocused dis-
satisfaction with Columbia life.’. ..

So what does all this mean for
Washington and Lee University, a
small men’s school nestled-in-the-foot-
hills-of-the-Blue - Ridge - Mountains?
Certainly it is true that the problems
of big universities like Columbia and
Boston are not entirely duplicated
on this campus. Most students are
not really concerned with the plight
of the Black American: there is a
hawkish air to the foreign policy
opinions held by students; the dis-
tance between students and faculty is
nicely bridged: Deans are available to
students even if Mr. Atwood cannot

Colonels outrank Generals
as defense meets its match

Fine defensive line play by the
opposition, Centre College's home-
coming, and numerous injuries, all
added up to the Washington and Lee
football team’s third loss in as many
outings. Quick scores in the first and
third quarters gave Centre the vic-
tory in a fine defensive battle.

Receiving the opening kick-off on
their own sixteen, the Colonels
launched the only solid drive of the
day. They moved the ball all the
way down to the W&L four before
the Generals finally dug in and held.
On fourth down, Jay Van Arsdale
kicked a 21 yard field goal from the
eleven to give the home team a 3-0
lead.

From that time on, the game turn-
ed into a stalemate. The Big Blue
took the kickoff deep in their own
territory and were unable to move
it. The punt to Centre gave the
Colonels fine field position but they
too, were unable to pick up any yard-
age. That was the course of the whole
game.

From time to time the offensive
units would break out of their leth-
argy by doing something drastically
wrong instead of just badly. As the
first quarter was coming to an end,

Centre had possession of the football
in W&L territory. Quarterback Paul

on the 23. On the very first play

ed, and the Colonels took over on
the W&L 17. Playing solid defense,
however, the Blue held on their own
ten, and with fourth and three Centre
elected to go for the first down. A

run netted two yards and W&L re-
gained the ball on the eight.
The Generals only made it into

Centre territory twice. It almost paid
the first time, though. Taking the ball
from their own 25, the Blue marched
the ball down to the Colonel's 26 be-
fore their attack bogged down with
about five minutes remaining in the
second quarter. Responsible for the
drive were Dick Kinney’s 25 yard
run, and two passes from Jack Baizley
to Buck Cunningham.

The second half was equally as
hard fought as the first, as the Gen-
erals were unable to keep the ball
out of their own territory due to
poor punting and offense. Yet, the
defense continued to hold off the op-

position, and a 3-0 game was be-
ginning to appear likely. With four
and a half minutes left in the third

quarter, Centre had the ball on the

Big Blue rugby team which plays an
almost completely major college
schedule.

Despite financial difficulties, coach-
ing deficiencies, student apathy, and
the lack of a suitable playing field,
rugby is here to stay at W&L. This
year’s squad is more active than ever,
too. The fall schedule includes match-
ups with U. Va., Richmond, Duke,
and Maryland. In the spring, there
will even be a Washington and Lee
invitational tournament.

The team is only two years old,
but in that time it has stirred up so
much controversy that the admini-
stration, athletic department, IFC, and
Executive Committee have all had
something to say about the fledging
sport. About the only group on
campus that has ignored the team
is the student body.

The problem is that the team has
no official sanction from the Univer-
sity itself. This is as the team would
have it, however. All the teams W&L
competes with are members of the
Eastern Intercollegiate Rugby Union.
The union’s rules specifically forbid
play with any varsity teams.

Hence, the Generals rugby club
prefers its non-varsity status. Yet the
team has been completely shunned
by the administration, a fact which
I find regrettable. Other clubs get
direct subsidies from their universi-
ties, but at W&L rugby is orphaned.
Princeton annually gives $6,000 to
support her team.

Fortunately, the first steps toward
recognition were taken last year when
the Executive Committee voted the
club $300 toward this year’s expenses.
That amount will just barely cover
the expense of necessary new uni-
forms. This year the athletic depart-
ment has found itself operating in the
red for the first time, so it is
logical that they cannot offer aid to
the club at present.

But this is the first occasion the

Rugby deserves more support

 

department has had this difficulty in

 

some time, and it is only fair to say
that the department could in the
future plan some aid for the team.
As of now, the individual players
must drive to their away games in
their own cars. Not only is_ that
troublesome, but it precludes any
games much further than a hundred
miles.

There is one thing the athletic de-
partment could do for the club,
though. Currently ,the club is forced
to play all its home games (and most
games are scheduled at home) on the
upper intramural field. While this is
a fine practice area, it is hardly the
safest for a game like rugby, which is
about as rough as it can possibly be.
For the enjoyment of the game by
fans and players alike, it would be
much better to allow the club to
play on Wilson Field.

Last year the club negotiated with
the department to play one of its
games there, so long as it didn’t rain.
The day of the game it rained. Be-
cause rugby isn’t any more harmful
to the turf than lacrosse or football,
which are presently played on Wilson
Field, there is no reason why that
negotiation couldn't be extended to
the club full-time this year.

Such a privilege would be of great
benefit to the student body. Scheduled
for the spring, tentatively Spring’s
Weekend, is the first annual Washing-
ton and Lee Invitational Rugby
Tournament. Scheduled to participate
are Duke, Richmond, W&L, and
either Villanova, Vanderbilt, or Tufts.
What other sport at this school can
boast an event with competition like
that?

It's an authentic team, too, not just
a collection of individuals who play

Fechnay and Mitchell tell

about their soccer careers

By CARTER REDD

This year marks the last soccer
season for the two varsity standouts
and co-captains, Thom Mitchell and
Scott Fechnay. Fechnay has been a
letterman for four years; Mitchell
for three.

Mitchell, an American History ma-
jor, lives in Middletown, N.Y., where
he began his soccer career in the
fifth grade. He admits to being a

 

Harriers run to victory over three

opponents; Zeliff takes first place

WAL cross-country hopes soared
last Friday as the General harriers
took first place in a quadruple meet,
boosting their record to 4-0. Fine
running by all members of the team
was responsible.

In the meet, Washington and Lee
took first place with 33 points; Som-
erset Community College was second
with 41. Centre College and Transyl-
vania College finished third and fourth

 

Disciplinary problems and injuries
continued to plague the Washington |
and Lee soccer team as the Generals |
fell to Randolph-Macon, 4-2, on
Friday in Ashland. Although Coach |
Lyles felt that the team had done
better than was to be expected, he
was obviously annoyed and disap-
pointed that there was so little to)
expect.

“This was not a total ball club|
that faced Randolph-Macon, Three-|
fourths of our individual players were |
playing as individuals. R-MC played |
as a team, and it showed up in their |
fine passing. We did have some in-
juries, and so we have not been
able to practice as a team.” He stated
that the Generals should start win-
ning afler more practices were held |
with the full team in atendance.

In the game Randolph-Macon car-
ried a 2-0 lead into the third quarter
before John Yow scored for WAL
with an assist from Scott Fechnay.
R-MC scored again, but WAL nar-
rowed the gap to 3-2 in the final

 

quarter on Fechnay'’s penatly kick.
R-MC then wrapped up the game
with a final tally,

Coach Lyles commended fullbacks
Brian Price, Mark Sayers, and Fred
Fletcher for their outstanding efforts.
He also had praise for Carl Hyatt,
who played most of the game with a
knee injury. Said the coach, “I wish
I had 100 more like him.” Goalie
Thom Mitchell recorded 25 saves for
WAL, but the story of the game was
| that R-MC took 28 shots to the Gen-
erals’ 12.

The JV soccer team scored its first
victory of the season over Massanut-
ten on Saturday. The team incorpo-
| rated good defense and balanced scor-
ing into the 4-1 decision. Sandy Bay-
less paced the jayvees by scoring two
penalty kicks. The other goals were
scored by David Manson and Carter |
Redd.

Primarily responsible for the improve-
ment so far has been the rapid
emergence of Zeliff as a premier run-
ner and the recovery of Pearcy from
last year’s injury. If Darsie, who is
used to running a two-mile course,
can adjust to the collegiate four-
mile, then Coach Miller should be

he played football, track,

“hotdog,” and claims to wear a dif-
ferent uniform to each game for the
few soccer fans who find the energy
to make the trip up to the soccer
field.

In spite of his regret that there
is a lack of spirit at W&L, he likes
being able to play because he enjoys
the game instead of being forced to
play.

Although the goalie position
probably the roughest in soccer, he
prefers it to football because “foot-
ball is too rough and soccer requires
more finesse.” He says he would like
to be a professional athlete, but con-
siders his chances slight, even though
he has been scouted by major league
baseball teams and has been picked
for the all-state soccer team for two
years. At present, he is thinking of
joining the peace corps.

The other soccer captain, Scott
Fechnay, started playing soccer at age
3144 when his family moved to Eng-
land, When he returned to America
his soccer career was interrupted be-
cause his high school did not have
a soccer team. To offset this deficiency

As a member of the All-South

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Field’s drama review

(Continued from Page 2)

ness: “Fame is long. Death is longer
...Does anyone ever die for any-
thing? I thought so once. Life was
fierce with feeling. It was all hope...
Swords shone and armour sang, and
cheese bit you, and kissing burned
and Death—ah, death was going to
make an exception in my case.

“I couldn’t believe I was ever going
to die. But once you know it—really
know it—it’s all over. You know
you've been cheated, and nothing's
the same again.”

To rescue himself from this dis-
order, De Nizza has found his own
answer, which he feels must be im-
parted to the natives and Pizarro:
“Love is the only door from the
prison of ourselves. It is the eager-
ness of God to enter that prison, to
take on pain, and imagine lust, so
that the torn soldier, or the spent
lecher, can call out in his defeat: “You
know this too, so help me fro mit.’”

But Pizarro finds love and God
alien to his being. The closest he
comes to faith is his relationship with |
Atahuallpa; amazed by the god-like
man who firmly believes himself to
be the son of the sun, Pizarro says: |
“It's the only way to give life mean- |
ing! To blast out of time and live
forever, us, in our own persons. This
is the law: die in despair or be a
God yourself! Look at him:
always so calm as if the teeth of
life never bit him ... or the teeth
of death. What if it was really
true... that I've gone God-hunting
and caught one.”

De Nizza tries to persuade Pizzaro
to eliminate the sun-king who has
created a society of perfect stability
and order at the expense of all free-
dom: “What is this pain in you that
month after month makes you hurl
yourself against the cage of time?

“... This is God, driving you to
accept divine eternity. Take it, Gen-

eral: not this pathetic copy of
eternity the Incas have tried to make
on earth, Peru is a sepulchre of the
soul. For the sake of the free spirit
in each of us it must be destroyed.”

Atahuallpa also calls for his own
murder, believing his resurrection will
give Pizarro hope: “You will die
soon and you do not believe in your
God. That is why you tremble and
keep no word. Believe in me. 1 will
give you a word and fill you with
joy. For you I will do a great thing.
I will swallow death and spit it out
of me.”

After murdering Atahuallpa_ in
hopes of discovering God, the fact
that Pizarro had gropingly found a
sort of faith and the shattering im-
pact of its destruction when he speaks
to the dead hulk becomes apparent:
“God's just a name on your nail;
and naming begins cries and cruel-
ties.

“But to live without hope of after,
and make whatever God there is, oh,
that’s some immortal business surely
... I'm tired. Where are you? You're
I'd warm you if I could,
no warming now, not

so cold,
But there's
ever now.
“I'm colding too. There’s a snow
of death falling all round us. You
can almost see it. It's over lad, I'm
coming after you. There's nothing but
peace to come. We'll be put into the
same earth, father and son in our)
own land. And that sun will roam |
uncaught over his empty pasture.” |
Perhaps from his spiritual debris has |
arisen something greater than faith. |

The next time any one of you
students has doubts about an archaic
fraternity system that demands con-
formity yet forces changes on little
old ladies who rent rooms to girls,
the next time ROTC authoritarianism
seems to be in contradiction with a
political science class in international
relations where you are told to ques-
tion all conclusions, will you please
stand up and say, “What the hell is|
going on?”...

 

At W&L the professors are asking |
the questions. Dean Atwood is the}
one who fights for changes in campus |
life, not the students. And yet here |
we have channels for students to|
voice demands for change; they)
fought for such channels at Columbia, |

could answer questions about the|
effectiveness of grades,

If people continue to just exist on
this campus, without any attempt to
justify that existence or define the
purpose of that existence, Washing-

And unless the University clearly de-
fines its function and makes sure that
function is relevant, then it deserves
to die, it deserves to be destroyed.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

We are very disappointed in the Executive
Committee.

At Tuesday’s meeting the EC voted down
Steve Sandler’s motion to support the Inter-
fraternity Council, which urged all girls to
patronize those lodging home that would
be willing to take in Negroes. Sandler’s motion
also asked the EC to help the IFC compile
a list of these houses and publish and ad-
vertise this list in Lexington and at the sur-
rounding girls’ scools.

By rejecting this motion, the EC, which
is the voice of the student body, has approved
of the situation as it now exists. In effect,
the EC’s decision states that W&L favors
discrimination and is not in favor of chang-
ing housing policies.

The EC has chosen to ignore the fact
that problem exists. Certain members of
the EC feel that since there is adequate hous-
ing for the Negro students now at W&L
everything is all right. This shows narrow-
minded reasoning. Wherever discrimination

Friday, October 11, 1968

We Are Disappointed In The EC

is involved, there is a problem. Whenever a
person cannot stay in a place of public lodg-
ing because of his color, there is a definite
problem. It is a fact that a problem cannot
be solved by ignoring it. It will not be cor-
rected until something concrete is done.

For the above reason we commend the
IFC. They see that a problem exists and they
are willing to stick their necks out to do some-
thing about it. Even if this is just a token of
action on the part of the IFC, as many
people have claimed, at least this is a step in
the right direction.

The IFC will now have to act without the
support of the EC in this endeavor, but it
does not need this support. It brought the
issue out into the open without the EC’s aid
and made both the student body and the
women who run the lodging homes conscious
of the situation. We are confident the IFC, as
the spokesman for all the fraternities and their
members, will not need the EC’s help in ac-
complishing its goal.

 

Yet Another Five-Day Plan

In spite of the Executive Committee’s
blunder on the above issue, this body ap-
proved what we believe to be the best plan
we have seen for a five-day week schedule.

Last week we stated that Plan A would be
the best for W&L of the five formulated by
the faculty committee. However, we did not
realize that the faculty could consider any
plan it wanted to in addition to the ones
presented to it by the faculty committee. This
is fortunate, for now the wishes of the stu-
dents can now be heard.

The plan approved by the EC is the
Ring-tum Phi plan. Classes would meet for

hours A,C,E,G,I or B,D,F,H,J. The major
alteration is that classes would meet one week

on MWFE and the following week on TT.

The advantages to this program are that
there are no scheduled afternoon classes; no
change in examination schedules; five minutes
between classes; no increase in the school
year; and no red tape to keep this plan from
going into effect next semester.

The disadvantages to this plan are that
the school day is increased by one-half hour;
lunch is shortened by 15 minutes; and stu-
dents and faculty members will lose 25 minutes

The Lodging Issue
Dear Editor:
With reference to the Times Dis-
patch article of October 5 (a copy
of which is enclosed), may I say that
my black brothers and sisters and I
here at Virginia State appreciated the
position that the Ring-tum Phi has
taken on the issue of lodging in the
Washington and Lee area.

If your efforts are sincere, then 1
challenge you to stand with us through
light and darkness until the problems
of racism and segregation cease to be.

Again, I thank you,

For black and white together,
Charles L. Farrar

Senior, Accounting major
Virginia State College

 

 

Congratulations, EC!

To the Editor of the Friday
Edition of the Ring-tum Phi:

My utmost congratulations to
Washington and Lee’s Executive Com-
mittee for having put the Interfra-
ternity Council in its place. Although
in past years the IFC has been suffi-
ciently passive to satisfy the restive
W&L student body, this group has all
of a sudden begun meddling in affairs
obviously not in the realm of this
academic community.

What right does a bunch of stu-
dents have to criticize the stolid and
staid FFVY women who have lived
in Lexington for centuries? These
women recognize the difference be-
tween black and white, and have
reacted in response to these dif-
ferences.

Thank Lee that our Executive
Committee has seen fit to protect
these women from the IFC’s sland-
erous attacks. The members of the
EC who so lucidly pointed out that
“we shouldn’t make any trouble” be-
cause “there really isn’t any problem”
deserve the thanks of the student
body.

In all good faith, I remain

Lexington ’s New Ordinance On Noise

The city of Lexington has enacted a new
ordinance condemning noise. If it is en-
forced Lexington will become the quietest
city in the world. Just think of all the rest
homes and hospitals that would like to settle
here then.

Permit us to quote some of this new ordi-
nance to you.

“The making and creation of loud, un-
necessary or unusual noises within the limits
of the City of Lexington is a condition which
has existed for some time . . .”

“Tt shall be unlawful for any person to
make, continue, or cause to be made or con-
tinued any loud, unnecessary or unusual noise
or any noise which either annoys, disturbs,
injures or endangers the comfort, repose,
health, peace or safety of others, within the
limits of the city.”

The following acts are declared to be
“loud, disturbing and unnecessary noises” in
violation of this ordinance:

“Horns, Signaling Devices, etc. The
sounding of any horn or a signaling device
on any automobile, motorcycle, or other ve-
hicle on any street or public place of the city,
except as a danger warning.”

“Radios, Phonographs, ete. The using,
operating, or permitting to be played, used
or operated any radio receiving set, musical
instrument, phonograph, or other machine

or device for the producing or reproducing of
sound in such manner as to disturb the peace,
quiet and comfort of the neighboring inhabi-
tants or at any time with louder volume than
is necessary for convenient hearing for the
person or persons who are in the room...
The operation of any such. .. between the
hours of eleven o'clock p.m. and seven o'clock
a.m. in such a manner as to be plainly audible
at a distance of fifty (50) feet from the build-
ing . . . shall be prima facie evidence of a
violation . . .”

“Animals, Birds, etc. The keeping of any
animal or bird which by causing frequent or
long continued noise shall disturb the com-
for or repose of any persons in the vicinity.”

“Exhausts. The discharge into the open
air of the exhaust of any stationary internal
combustion engine, or motor vehicle except
through a muffler . . .”

“Defect in Vehicle or Load. The use of
any automobile, motorcycle, or vehicle out of
repair, so loaded or in such manner as to
create loud and unnecessary grating, grinding,
rattling or other noise.”

These are the offenses. What are the
penalties? Any person who violates any pro-
vision of this ordinance shall be fined “not
exceeding $500.00 or by imprisonment for
not more more than thirty (30) days, or by
both said fine and said imprisonment.”

A Response To Leonard

To the editor:

I would like to take issue with
Danny Leonard's report concerning
the Democratic National Convention
(Sept. 27th issue). I believe it ap-
propriate and necessary to offer a
voice of dissent to Mr. Leonard's
interpretation of the events that took
place in Chicago.

First of all, Mr. Leonard states
that “Humphrey's strategy for win-
ning the nomination depended on two
key figures: Richard M. Nixon and
Richard J. Daley.” He implies that
the candidacy of Nixon would help
Humphrey. If this is so, one wouldn't
know it from reading the newspapers
or looking at the polls. Mr. Leonard
says that Daley was really working
for Humphrey all along and never
had any interest in a Kennedy candi-
dacy. Yet Daley was known to be
strongly leaning to Robert Kennedy
before the latter's assassination.

Lafayette may be without its two
top running backs when it faces Wash-
ington and Lee Saturday.

Both tailback Bob Zimmers of Rill-
ton, Pa. and fullback Tom Triolo
of Sharon Hill, Pa. worked out in
| sweat clothes Monday at Lafayette’s
| practice. Zimmers suffered a thigh
injury and Triolo banged his knee in
Lafayette’s 7-0 victory over Hofstra
last Saturday.

Zimmers lead Lafayette in rushing
with 218 yards in 51 carries (a 4.3
average), punting with a 36.0 aver-
age and scoring with 18 points. Triolo
is next in rushing with 100 yards on
36 carries.

Last night the IFC unanimously |

| passed a motion calling for the crea-

tion of a joint faculty-student com-
mittee to study the problem of rush
at W&L. The committee in the IFC's |
opinion would be the best way to)
the conflict between the ma-|
jority of the faculty and the stu tent

body as to which system of rua is
most beneficial to Washingion and
Lee.

The motion, the text of which is

published in this paper, cited previous
surveys to chow that deferred rush
does not improve scholastic achieve-
ment, and in the context of Lexing-
ton would be socially prohibitive.
Walter Lockhart stated that the social
responsibility of the fraternities was
incompatible with the maintaining of
the fraternity’s self-interest in the
matter and that the newly-created
committee could best resolve these
two conflicting needs.

Danny Leonard felt that due to
the unique situation of the Lexington
environment, the faculty-student com-
mittee would be the best possible
means to thrash out a rush system
compatible to both the students and
the faculty. John Carrere felt that he
could not proceed any further in con-
sidering the IFC’s proposal until he
was assured that the faculty would
take steps to create an adequate social
life for the freshman class.

Dr. Atwood, the faculty advisor to
the IFC, attempted to interpret the
reactions of the faculty to the resolu-
tion, He cited that rush had been
discussed and analyzed frequently
during the last several years and that

Text of IFC resolution

At last week’s meeting, the proposal prepared by
the deferred rush committee was discussed. After 15
months of study, that committee submitted a deferred
rush plan calling for not contact between freshmen and
upperclassmen for one semester. It is that committee's
judgment that of all possible plans for deferred rush,
this is the most feasible one, being more consistent with
the edict of the faculty and having fewer disadvantages
than other plans. A Ring-tum Phi writer labeled this
long-considered plan unrealistic, impractical and “phan-
tasmogoric buffoonery.” We tend to agree with that
writer. But let us point out hat the fault does not
lie, in our opinion, with the deferred rush committee:
rather it lies with the conception and application of
deferred rush to the unique situation found among
Washington and Lee fraternities.

What the study of the deferred rush committee indi-
cates is that there are no good alternatives to the
present system of rush, imperfect though it is. Even
with imperfections, the present systems has positive
aspects which we feel make it more advantageous than

| deferred rush. We also wish to make it clear that our

concern in this matter is the provision of an attractive
social life for the freshmen within a system in the best
interests of the University.

With this in mind, | move that the Interfraternity
Council request President Huntley to appoint 5 faculty
members to meet with 5 students chosen by the IFC to
consider the possibility to resccision or modificaion of
the deferred rush decision, continuance of preschool rush
and modification within the present rush framework to
alleviate existing deficiencies.

After careful consideration of the motter to de-
ferred rush, we have concluded that that program is un-
feasible for Washington and Lee for several reasons.

First, we think that in handing down its decision
tention to the practical problems involved n imple
tention to the practical problems involved in emple-
menting such a program—such problems as determining
contact rules (or not contact rules) which are realistic
for the environment at WA&L yet stringent enough to
prevent a semester of intensified rush instead of a week

The committee found that at most schools where de
ferred rush is conducted, no contact between freshmen
and upperclassmen is permitied until rush commences
We wonder whether this is a desirable situaion at WAI
in view of its emphasis on a small, friendly student
body. What advantage is there in separating the fresh
men from the upperclassmen for a semester?

And yet, consider the alternatives of allowing con
tact first semester. Permission of contact firsi semester
would lead to a strenuous semester-long rush, a situa-
tion that would be undesirable for all concerned

An equally important objection to deferred rush is
that the alternatives to fraternity-oriented social life dur
ing the semester-long quarantine are questionable. One
of the unique aspects of WAL is that fraternities are the
social life here. Even with completion of the much
needed Siudent Union, it is doubiful that comparable

social activities can be offered to the freshmen first
semester.

Whether “no contact” rules or “unlimited contact
rules are adopted in the event of deferred rush, a di
lemma arises

Assuming that “no contact” rules are endorsed we

On the other hand, if rules permitting contact be
tween upperclassmen and freshmen during the first
semester are accepted, we contend that pressure on the
freshmen will increase, rather than decrease as has
been predicted by proponents of deferred rush. Under
a deferred rush program permitting contact, each fresh-
man will be living in a virtual aquarium with contless
upperclassmen watching each move he makes, seeking
to determine which freshmen they are interested in.

Subject to such constant surveillance, we believe the
freshmen will be preoccupied with always making a good
impression for a whole semester rather than for a single
week. Consequently, less thought, not more, will be
given to academic work. From a report on deferred
rush prepared for the National Interfraternity Council,
with 129 institutions reporting came the following state-
ments. “The almost universal complaint against de-
ferred pledging is that it keeps the students’ mind center-
ed on making a fraternity instead of getting down to
the business of studying. Those colleges that get rush
ing out of the way before the opening of college or
during the first week seem better satisfied. That mistakes
are made on the part of both freshmen and fraternities
are admitted, but the settled of the students out-
weighs this disadvantage.”

state

Stull another objection to deferred rush,
no contact or limited contact, is that the counsel, advice
and judgement of upperclassmen will not be available
to the freshmen, as it now It is doubiful that fresh-
men will be as quickly and easily assimilated into uni-
versity life without association with upperclassmen.

The final objection to deferred rush is that it is
certainly doubtful that it will accomplish what is cup-
posed to namely a better academic performance on the
part of the freshmen. William S. Zerman, former Dean
of Men at Michigan University reports: “Anyone who
says that there are good scholastic reasons for deferred
rush should produce the evidence. There is absolutely
no evidence in the last twenty to twenty-five years which
indicates that individuals and fraternal groups

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Our forgotten conscience

In the works of man as in those of nature,
it is the intention

which is chiefly worth studying.

—Goethe

An educational dilemma

There is an underlying philosophical question which neces-
sarily permeates any discussion of change in the area of student
affairs as they relate to the University:

To what extent must Washington and Lee concern itself
with education, and when should such formal training be
allowed to take second place to the students’ non-academic

needs?
a

This dilemma is certainly not unique to Washington and
Lee, but in the last three years this campus has felt it as a
burr under the saddle of leisurely change. ® Saturday
classes—Must the faculty consider the desire of the student
body, or what its needs are thought to be? How much free
time is too much? How much responsibility can wisely be en-
trusted to students for their own study habits? ® Pass/Fail—
though grades are not perfect indicators of performance, is
P/F enough? Or is it too liberal? © Liquor on campus—
is the Board of Trustees acting in the students’ best interest,
or is it time for a judicious review? Does the decision on beer
in the student union reflect enough such review? ® Self-
discipline—Are college men capable of determining their own
standards of conduct? And to what extent? In what areas?

At this point it is logical to consider the fraternity rush
system at Washington and Lee, using our basic question as a
guideline in determining some sort of reasonable solution.

We do not take issue with the faculty’s decision of May,
1967, which called for deferred rush. In principle that choice
was wise and necessary. What concerns the student body is
that deferred rush, on this campus, may be a negative factor
in all areas of University life if an entire semester must be
inserted between the beginning of school and the beginning
of rush.

Two sets of problems

We are not an ordinary school in social aspects. There is
no such thing as a casual date here because the average date
requires a minimum of two hours travel time. Thus the stud
farm image is not wholly inaccurate. As Lee Halford told the
freshmen this September in an address on academic excel-
lence, “We work hard and we party hard; both are necessary.”

They certainly are. Witness the dolor of those unfortunate
freshmen who do not receive bids during rush week, who
spend their years at this practically isolated University and
chastise both fraternities as well as themselves.

A massive part of assimilation into the school and its social
realm and transition to post-baccalaureate life is thrust upon
the fraternities as a responsibility which they do in fact assume.
But do they assume it adequately? Perhaps not, but to resolve
this inequity would require years of planning and a complete
change in the social structure here: this question now becomes
moot.

The responsibility nevertheless remains, and in spite of
its luxurious trappings the student union will not shoulder but
a small part. Jay Wetsel pointed out that a freshman sipping
a beer in the student union will be quite jealous while the
Sigma Chis across the street down bourbon or whatever.
Judson Simmons asked a not-so-facetious question, “Where
will freshmen have an opportunity for privacy with their
dates?” Where indeed?

We have introduced two problems here, both of which
are not without solution. On the one hand are those who, be-
cause of one week's worth of failure in making an impression
or assuming the desired social grace, are often denied for four
years access to Washington and Lee’s prime social function.
And then the freshmen under deferred rush must be con-
sidered, lest the University become known to prospective ap-
plicants for its copious boredom at a time when life is most
exciting.

There are a great many flaws in rush as it has been prac-
ticed for decades here. Freshmen who join do so on the basis
of what is largely a facade carried on for one week: actives
are, if for the only time each year, considerate of others.
Rushees are not given an opportunity to decide for them-
selves if fraternity membership is in fact a must at Wash-
ington and Lee. Before pledging, few are allowed to see what
a combo party really is or what individual fraternities have
what kind of parties. And there is the fact that rushing before
the start of school makes a poor background for college’s
prime purpose, education.

For these and other reasons we are pleased to see the end
of traditional rush week,

Logically, at first glance, the faculty was right. Rush should
be after the first semester. This provides time—that entity so
necessary to negate most of the misfortunes and hazards con-
nected with rush week as we have experienced it. And Dean
Atwood made one point quite clear, that the fraternities
through the IFC were given almost full control in engineer-
ing the logistics of deferred rush. Presumably it was the fac-
ulty’s hope that the eighteen elite would provide freshmen
with social outlets. From what sources, however, would come
funds with which to finance this awesome task?

Some have said that fraternities would go overboard to
please freshmen, spending ludicrous sums on combos, liquor,
food, and transportation. We think not. Instead, if given the
opportunity by the IFC to entertain freshmen at weekend

 

 

parties before pledging, fraternities would continue as be-
fore—amounting to an unequivocal subsidy of the entire
freshman class on a non-selective basis, not to mention their
dates, which would hardly be fair to actives.

The matter of pressure on freshmen cannot be ignored.
If rush is delayed until February, freshmen will be under con-
stant and severe pressure from within—they will worry far
too long and needlessly about impressions they make; they
will worry about whether House No. 1 on their list will extend
a bid; they will worry over the best choice to make.

Is there no solution? We think there is. Two extremes
have been delineated, each with its own set of problems. Tra-
ditional rush is not acceptable by the faculty; the fraternities
eschew rush deferred for a semester. The difference can be
resolved; we write not in hectic language nor in haste (this
was prepared a week ago), but with the best interests of
freshmen in mind, first of all, then with vested sympathy for
the fraternity system.

A concrete proposal

How, then, can our intentions be applied to result in a
system of rush acceptable to, if not endorsed by, both the
faculty and the fraternities?

We would be in an ideal situation were the University
instead of the fraternity system given first contact with the
freshmen, were the fraternities allowed to pledge early enough
so that inadequate finances would not be their undoing, were
freshmen given ample opportunity to survey the individual
houses as well as the system itself, and were freshmen also al-
lowed to so choose without having to suffer a dismal first se-
mester.

We can have all these, and here’s how:

School begins as usual, less rush week. At the first of
October, the IFC collects $25 from each freshman who wants
to participate in rush, $20 more than in past years. This
money, distributed to the fraternities, provides approximately
$350 to each which may be used to help with expenses. Then
for a month freshmen visit the houses, and in early Novem-
ber bids are extended.

In this way we have made a postive response to the dual
dilemma otherwise faced and have resolved many of the prob-
lems which are peripheral to the two extreme cases.

Rush lasts a month. Freshmen will be able to begin school
as school ought to be begun—by studying—and later are
given four weeks to look at fraternity houses. They spend
time during football weekends, Openings, and Homecoming
at various houses, and by Parents’ Weekend a choice will be
made by most. Then fraternitites may begin to boost their
coffers (or keep them from chronic emptiness) with the
added income from fifteen or so pledges.

One of the most important aspects in which this plan will
be of great help is in allowing more freshmen to receive bids.
Sad is the case of the rushee shunned by his erstwhile judges.
Saddest of all is the much too frequent outcome, that these
men are more socially acceptable than many fraternity actives.
The non-fraternity men—those whose proud and bitter bur-
den stigmatizes their whole value system and their social life
if not their psyche—would have an infinitely better chance
to overcome transient faults not wholly of their own making.

How it would work

This plan will have to be slightly flexible since the schedule
of fall events is a factor, but in general it would conduct
rush starting on the Monday after IFC fees are collected.
For two weeks the freshmen visit houses during twelve smok-
ers (much the same as open houses in this year’s rush); one
smoker lasting one hour is scheduled on each of Monday
through Friday, then two on Sunday afternoon, then five
more the next week. Study time is not jeopardized since one
hour each evening is all that is required, and each house will
see the same number of freshmen and each freshman will
see the same number of houses as each did during past
rushes.

After the smokers, the fraternities must choose eighty
freshmen to invite back and submit a list to the IFC. Fresh-
men, in turn, list four fraternities in which they are interested.
The freshmen then return to the houses for four combo
parties in three weekends (one being Openings). Fraternities
are responsible for securing twenty dates for the freshmen at
each combo. In this way the fraternities have returning those
freshmen with whom there is mutual interest, and rushees can
be selective under no pressure.

Two problems are here encountered: What if some fresh-
men are not invited to four parties? What if freshmen are
interested in more than four houses? Both have common so-
lutions. The fraternities have a total of eighty rushees each
for the four parties, which means that if they are not listed
by the same freshmen whom they listed then random placing
by the IFC will occur. In addition, during the two remaining
weeks of rush freshmen may sign up to see two more houses,
one each on two Wednesday nights, at ninety-minute smokers.
They may choose from fourteen houses, those being the fra-
ternities to which they are not scheduled to visit during a com-
bo. This requires freshmen to consider where they may have
a better opportunity to secure an invitation (or for that mat

ter, a bid), after having more time to spend with the actives.

After each of these two smokers, fraternities are given
the option of submitting ten names to replace any ten names
on the original list should some of those not have chosen
the particular fraternity. Also, freshmen may similarly sub-
mit two fraternity changes to the IFC, provided neither house
has yet been visited by that freshman for a combo party. This
means that for the last two combo parties some changes in
appointments are allowed, which should give rushees a chance
to be more available and fraternities an opportunity to invite
the “‘sleepers” back.

When the four-week period has ended, fraternities submit
a list to the IFC of those freshmen it would like to have as
pledges. The freshmen turn in a preferential card, and rush is
ended,

Fraternities would not have formal bid sessions during the
rush period. This forces freshmen to return to all of the four
houses at combos, ensuring a somewhat more open mind on
their part. And some fraternities, not wholly sure of their
pledge status, may become more flexible in their bidding.

Contact between freshmen and upperclassmen would be
limited (except for the rush provisions) to on-campus con-
versation, campus being defined as University property, with
the exceptions of the two freshman dormitories and the Dutch
Inn and McCormick Library.

This plan includes several definite advantages over both
the traditional rush week and the system as it would be after de-
ferral for a semester.

Freshmen will have an adequate social life during October
when there are more parties than in any other month. And yet
they will start school in a proper atmosphere, free from the
confusions and other-directed excitment after rush week.

There is time before rush starts for freshmen to adapt to
the college rigors and to learn to relax without having to do so
in the initial barrage of conflicting impressions that has so
characterized assimilation at Washington and Lee.

Freshmen will then be better able to present themselves as
the pleasant, compatible people most of them are, which con-
veyance of image was too often stifled previously. Fraternities
will as a result have the inclination to bid more rushees, which
can only result in fewer disappointed freshmen, more diversi-
fied houses, and a better background against which the Uni-
versity will view fraternities.

Toward maturity

It is obviously not going to be a problem to convince the
fraternities and the IFC that this is a reasonable plan. Con-
vincing the faculty may require more initiative.

We cannot espouse platitudes about the ideals of fraternity
life and purpose. Everyone knows what service is performed by
the Greeks—a social service—but one that we feel is of abso-
lute necessity at Washington and Lee.

Fraternities have a long and vascillating reputation here,
one both embellished with genuine service to the community
and to the University and one tainted by the disreputble acts
of some.

And yet in the past few years fraternities have demon-
strated their ability at least to grapple with maturity if not
to conquer it. The examples are numerous: the Contact sym-
posium in February; fund drives; Greek Week; intramural
sports; concern over pension plans for fraternity employees;
a response to civil inequities.

In addition—or perhaps as a part of this—Washington and
Lee students have become more involved in University affairs.
An active and almost adamant role is played by many more
students than charges of apathy would indicate. In these devel-
opments we are proud to be a part of the fraternity system,
proud to promote it, and proud to think in serious terms and
with confidence in its future relevance to the school and con-
tributions to the students.

We believe that the fraternities have begun to realize and
accept their responsibility to the welfare of the student body as
a whole, especially to the freshmen. Gone are the days of
ubiquitous hazing, frightening rallies, and torture-chamber
Hell Weeks. The Brotherhood of which actives so fondly
(and seldom) speak is at once breaking and building anew—
breaking its outdated and unacceptable customs and rebuilding
foundations on the basis of concern for fraternity members
and others.

We suppose that last year or the year before the IFC
would hardly have qualified to be called a group interested
in others. And now that description has a believable sound
to it—this has been evident these first four meetings when
the old IFC blahs of years past simply were not present.
Some thinking has been taking place, some definite and posi-
tive action has been occurring, and some concern has been
shown for more than the primary interests of the fraterni-
ties,

Is reconsideration possible?

It has been eighteen months since deferred rush cleared
the faculty, 43-28.The intention was, as we said, admirable.
What we now ask is not that deferred rush be repealed, but
rather that it be allowed to take place during the first semester.

We think it will work, not only for the fraternities but for
the University as the fraternity system assumes its responsi-
bilities to the freshmen and its proper relation to the purposes
and goals and ideals of Washington and Lee.

We're not going to beg the faculty to adopt this plan as a

|| crusade, if only because the total history of fraternities here

provides no easy vehicle with which to cruise our desires past
a sympathetic group of professors. Hardly, What we do ask
for the fraternity system, though, is another consideration.
based on fraternities’ admittedly eleventh-hour but neverthe-
less sincere self-appraisal.

The Generals’ varsity gridders went
down to their fourth defeat of the
season on Saturday, losing to the
Leopards of Lafayette College. The
visitors scored three times in the

second half to squelch the beginnings |

of a W&L rally toward the end of
the third quarter.

Spectators were fortunate to see an
exciting game highlighted by the bril-
liant breakaway running of Lafayette’s
Bob Donofrio. It was Donofrio who

Donofrio on fourth and ten.

Early in the third quarter, things
began to look bright for the Generals.
Starting a drive from their own 44,
they marched into Leopard territory.
But Jack Baizley was forced to eat
the ball on a third down play, and
the Blue punted. The punt carried
beautifully and bounced out on the
eight. On the first play from scrim-
mage, though, Donofrio broke away
to the visitors 43. The next play was
a pass to Molchan, complete on the
W&L 24. Quarterback Baker ran it

kick-off deep in his own territory,
flanker Bob Simpson returned it to
the General's 45. On first down, Baker
completed to Molchan at the W&L
32. The next play called for a line
buck by Donofrio. Breaking two
tackles, he crossed the goal line just
forty-five second after Gossman did,
to end the Blue rally. The kick was
wide for 20-7 score.

In the middle of the fourth quarter,
the Leopard’s lauched the last suc-
cessful drive of the afternoon. With
second and three inches on the 50,
QB Baker handed off to Donofrio
who gave it to Simpson. Simpson
went all the way to the W&L 22 on
the reverse, skirting left end, as the
General’s defense was completely
fooled. On the next play, Donofrio
took it to the four. Three plays later
he scored.

A word of praise is due halfback
Joe Dozier, who averaged 7.3 yards
per carry. Reports are that he will be
able to play Saturday despite his
injury.

In view of the long study of de-
ferred rush made by students, indi-
cating its impracticality, now is the
time for the administration and fac-
ulty to consider student opinion, In
regard to this matter, this is the
opportunity for the university to
operate in the manner in which it
says it does. And we feel sure that

The attitude of the faculty before
the resolution was clearly that de-
ferred rush must come and it would
truly be unfortunate if the fraternities
lost their opportunity to shape the
system best suited for their needs. If

i neither side gives in and if a com-

brotherhood aside for
getting to the point.

At Dartmouth, rush takes place at
the beginning of the sophomore year.
About 70% of the upperclassmen
join fraternities. Rush is deferred at
Dartmouth for the same reasons |
feel it would be desirable to defer it
lhere: to give college freshmen the
opportunity to adjust to college liv-
ing and college-level learning with-
out simultaneously undergoing — the
rigors of rushing, pledging, and fore-
ed-fed social life. There is ample
time for all of the latter, including
‘the unnecessary facets, after the stu-
| dent has adjusted to the study regime
| and independence which college hope-
fully offers...

Given this situation then, what al-
ternatives exist for a visible social
life for first year students at Dart-
mouth. Here, several contrasts with
Washington and Lee exist:

 

 

1, Women are allowed in dormi-
tories during the week from 4
p.m.-9 p.m., and on Friday and
Saturday from noon-! a.m.
Drinking is allowed in dormi-
tories. (New Hampshire drink-
ing age is 21, as in Virginia.)
3, Dormitories are well integrat-
ed: ie., freshmen were mixed
with upperclassmen facilitat-
ing important informal and
academic contact.

Consequently, the dormitories al

| parable in low quality with those on} cellence, in intramurals and in under-
i this campus) provide not only a mea-| taking service projects. Pressure will

portunity for more real contact with| physical appearances of their houses |
upperclassmen than that artificially |

 

forced during the rushing situation...

| agree that our dormitories are
nowhere near being suitable for social
entertaining, but I submit that they
are adequate for the time being until
improvements or additions are made.
Legal restrictions exist to dormitory
drinking, but the same rules are ap-
parently unenforced by the state in
the fraternities, and for that matter
in dormitories at Charlottesville. Re-
laxation of these dormitory rules in
conjunction with the opening of the
new student union and the beginning
of a deferred rush system would, in
my view, guarantee the possibility for
a reasonable freshman year social
life.

 

wash, not to mention the personal
appearances of the brothers .. .

Under the proposed system con-
sideration should be given to revising
the dormitory rules to allow liquor
in the dormitories, and to allow dates
in the dormitories at specified times
(even though the dormitories are not
presently physically suited to entertain
dates).

One tends to seriously doubt if
there would be many girls who would
ride buses to Lexington for mixers

in the student union for an entire |

semester. It would seem that dating
upperclassmen at Washington and
Lee, not to mention Charlottesville,
would be much more attractive. Per-
haps consideration should be given

‘The way I see it’: deferred rush

before people began to think. The
bomb fell last week with the con-
sideration of the actual deferred rush
plan. Now we are upset. But I think
we have followed a responsible path
to express our feelings.

The overwhelming majority of the
students (75-80%) who live in fra-
ternities stand united behind our find-
ing that, as far as the academic and
social lives of the incoming freshman
| are concerned, second semester de-
ferred rush is unfeasible for the W&L
Community in Lexington, Va. Yet we
see a faculty adamantly in favor of

‘that very same program.

 

Therefore, through the democratic
processes that have been made avail-

 

Consequently, as a teacher, I €n-| to extending clause six of the pro-| able to us—namely the IFC—we have

thusiastically endorse a deferred rush |
because I think a freshman gets a}
better start at the business of learn- |
ing without having to simultaneously |
endure the business of fraternity rush- |
ing and pledging. However, as an ex-
student, my endorsement is less than
enthusiastic unless some concomitant |
measures in liberalizing dormitory re-
strictions are taken.

Finally, it seems to me that the
fraternities, faculty, and next year’s
freshmen alike are well-intentioned
victims of the present physical plant.
A happy final solution can not come
next September, even though deferred
rush will. It is with this thought in
mind that I make the above interim
suggestions.

In this manner the fraternities could
provide rides for dates, and afford
the freshmen a deviation from the

requested that President Huntley ap-
| point a faculty committee to meet
with a student committee in order:
to open the lines of communication;
to cut through the mass of red tape
that dictates a superficial form of
|communication between faculty and
students—superficial in that one group
remains detached from the other in
any disagreement; to put faculty an!
student minds together to disagree
and to fight and to leave nothing
unsaid; and, in the end, to hopefully
discover the best possible system of
rush for the W&L Community.

We are making an appeal to rea-
son. For, although we realize the
deficiencies of the present system, we
also see deficiencies in deferred rush-
ing. So why can’t we sit down with
open minds to consider these de-
ficiencies on both sides, and work
out a plan for rush that will be as
unique as the W&L Community it-
self, and one that will be satisfactory
to all parties concerned??

If given the chance, I'm quite con-
fident that we can do just that, in
spite of ourselves!

To Be Keynotes
Of Homecoming

Alumni and guests from all over the
country began arriving in Lexington
last night in preparation for the an-
nual Washington and Lee Homecom-
ing festivities being held this week-
end,

This year’s Homecoming, while
clearly representative of a long-stand-
ing tradition, is nonetheless enhanced
by this morning’s Inauguration of a
Washington and Lee alumnus, Robert
Edward Royall Huntley, as President
of the University.

Student participation in the activi-
ties will begin at 6:45 p.m. at the
Varsity Club Pep Rally in Red Square.
Tomorrow at 2 p.m. following alumni
registration and luncheon, the W&L
football team will seek it’s first vic-
tory of 1968 against the Tigers of
Hampden-Sydney at Wilson Field,

According to Interfraternity Coun-

cil social chairman Dave Stovall, a
PiKA from Harrisonburg, Virginia,
preparations for the weekend have

been progressing throughout the fall.
The committee designated to select
the 1968 Homecoming Queen com-
pleted preliminary judging of pictures
on Wednesday night. Tonight, after
the candidates are introduced at the
rally, the actual official judging will
take place at 8 o'clock in duPont
Hall. The eventual winner and two
runners-up will be crowned, in keep-
ing with long-standing tradition, by
Dr. J. K. Shillington during halftime
of the Saturday football game. The

In his Inaugural address, Huntley

put special emphasis on the question,
“In times like these, what is the image
of Washington and Lee?”

He answered by saying, “It is the |
image of an institution which un-|
ashamedly proclaims that there is no
higher goal to which a scholar can
aspire than to be a vital teacher of |
young men, an institution which con-
fidently entrusts the largest possible |
measure of choice and freedom to its |
students and its faculty, requiring con-
formity of no one, prizing an environ-

- ment in which tolerance, integrity,
and respect for others tend to pre-|
vent misidentifying independence of

thought with lack of self-discipline or
humorless contempt.

he Inauguration was held at 11:00

a.m. today, with delegates represent
ing many colleges and universities,
learned societies, and foundations at-
tending. The ceremony, originally
scheduled to be held on the front
lawn of the campus, was moved to
Doremus Gymnasium because of

rainy weather.

Chief speaker at the ceremony was
Friday, President of the

consolidated University of North

Carolina. The oath of office was ad
ministered to President Huntley by
Dr. Huston St. Clair, Rector of the

University.

Huntley, a native of Winston-Salem,
North Carolina, was graduated from
Washington and Lee in 1950. He
received his LIB. from W&L seven
years later, after serving in the U.S
Navy from 1950 to 1953.

After one year with an Alexandria
law firm, Huntley returned to W&l
as Assistant Professor of Law. In
1959 he was named Associate Profes

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Looking Back: W&L’s Past Presidential Inaugurations

By OLLINGER CRENSHAW

Professor of History and University Historian

Installation ceremonies at Washington College
emerged and developed in the first half of the nine-
teenth century but in the early years were simple oath-
taking ceremonies at which, on occasion, the new Presi-
dent, as in the case of Dr. George Junkin in 1948,
delivered a formal inaugural address.

After the Civil War, much excitement accompanied
the eleection of General Robert E. Lee, as evidenced by
the comment of the Richmond Whig: “And now that
grand old Chieftain, after but brief repose, betakes him
to as noble a work as ever engaged the attention of
men—he has accepted the presidency of Washington
College, therein, by the exercise of his genius, and by
his virtues, and his high mora! character, to inspire the
sons of his well-beloved Virginia with a taste for lit-
erature and a love for what is great and good, Long
may he preside there. May happiness and long, long
years be his.” Many a Southern newspaper and some
Northern journals as well echoed the sentiment of the
Whig. Some outside the South, however, did not. In any
event, the eyes of the world soon turned to the remote
campus of Washington College.

Villagers and college people assumed an air of
expectancy in awaiting the arrival of the great man
soon to become one of themselves. The old Washington
College buildings were refurbished, so that to one on-
looker they appeared to be “quite charming.” General
Lee reached town in time to be presented to the Board
of Trustees, introduced by Rector Brockenbrough, at
its meeting on September 20,

In consultation with General Lee, plans were drawn
up for his inauguration, scheduled for October 2, 1865,
the first day of the new session. It had been proposed to
stage the ceremonies in the College chapel, to extend
invitations throughout the nation, to provide a_ brass
band, and to have “young girls robed in white, and
bearing chaplets of flowers, to sing songs of welcome;
to have congratulatory speeches, to make it a grand
holiday.” Perhaps in other circumstances this would have
been done, but at the expressed wish of General Lee the
exercises were to be the acme of simyplicity, “an exact
and barren compliance with the required formula of
taking the oath by the new President, and nothing
more 2

On the morning of October 2 the brief, private,
unostentatious inaugural ceremonies took place in a
recitation room of the College. General Lee was escort-
ed into the room by the trustees. Also present were

Gen, Robert E. Lee (1865-1871)

faculty, students, the clergymen of Lexington, a magi
starte, and the County Clerk. Upon the appearance and
introduction of General Lee all rose, bowed, and were
seated. Judge Brockenbrough called the meeting to order,
and James K. Edmondson, Secretary of the Board of
Trustees, called the roll of that body

\ quorum being present, the Reverend Dr. William
S. White offered “an impresive and fitting” prayer, in
which he besought blessing for the President of the
United States. Judge Brockenbrough then announced
the object of the meeting. It must have been a trial to
him, bursting with pride and emotion, to have restrained
his remarks, as speeches had been prohibited: even so
the Judge approached the dignity of an eloquent ad
dress. He adverted to the seriousness as well as the

 

joyfulness of the hour, eulogized General Lee, and
congratulated the trustees and students, present and
future, on the president.

President R. E. Lee stood with folded arms, gazing
into the eyes of the speaker. Squire William White,
Justice of the Rockbridge County Court, then administ
ered the oath of office to General Lee, employing
the quaint text provided by the charter of Liberty Hall.
It enjoined that the president should administer the
institutions’ affairs without “favor, affection, or parti
ality.” General Lee signed the oath, which was turned
over to the County Clerk for perpetual safekeeping,

Son Succeeds Father

Upon the death of General R. E. Lee, the trustees
of Washington College chose as his successor his son,

 

Dr. William L. Wilson (1897-1900)

and the keys of the College were handed by the Rector
to President Lee. As customary following such cremonies,
there was handshaking, after which General Lee passed
into the room which had been assigned to his use. The
Great Era had begun.

George Washington Custis Lee, a man destined to re
main in office for twenty-seven years. The inauguration
of Custis Lee on February 6, 1871, as President of
Washington and Lee University, resembled that of his
father in dignity and simplicity. It was consummated
in the old Chapel before an audience of townspeople
and students who had braved a heavy snow storm io
witness the ceremony. The faculties of V.M.1. and of
Washington and Lee attended the induction which was
prefaced by singing, prayer, and the reading of scripture
by the Reverend Dr. Pendleton of Grace Episcopal
church

Custis Lee took the oath of office. and then de
livered a fourteen line speech of acceptance (perhaps
the shortest such address on record'), in which he asked
the co-operation of trusiees, faculty, and students

Wilson Takes Office

Washington and Lee was fortunate enough to secure
the services of William Lyne Wilson, one-time Congress
man from West Virginia, and from 1895 to 1897, mem-
ber of President Cleveland's cabinet. Leaders in the
world of business, politics, and education mingled in
good-fellowship on the campus at the inauguration
September 15, 1897. Isidor Straus of New York. the
Georgia-born merchant prince, had come to do honor
to his devoted friend Wilson, as had the former cabinet
member, Hilary A. Herbert of Alabama. The Villards
father and son, Henry H. Villard, President of the
Northern Pacific Railroad, and Oswald Garrison Vil
lard, were present

Shortly after ten o'clock students and alumni march
ed in procession into the chapel, the orchestra rendered
“a beautiful selection.” the Reverend Dr. W. Strother
Jones offered prayer, and Judge William McLaughlin
began the formal inaugural proceedings to install in
office the ninth president in the chartered existence of
Washinteon and Lee

After a few opening paragraphs of gratelu: ac
knowledeement of the remarks of the visiling speakers
Wilson touched upon the sensitive question of sectar

Non Incautus Futuri

Robert E. R. Huntley was officially inau-
gurated today as Washington and Lee’s twen-
tieth president. However, in the few months
he has been “unofficially” working in this
position, we can see the course the Huntley
administration will follow. And we are greatly
encouraged by it

In the three main issues which most con
cern us—~alumni, community and student re
lations Pre sident Huntley has made notable
gains. Ede has traveled across the country to
ilumni associations, not only to introduce him
elf, but also in an effort to bring the alumni
up to date on Wa&L and to have them take

Especially in student relations have we
seen a marked improvement. President Hunt-
ley has made continuous efforts to speak to
campus organizations in order to exchange
ideas with them. He is anxious to know what
students want and what we are thinking. His
youth and his attitude make us feel that we
can communicate with him, and he can undet
stand us. Mis doors are open to everyonse
from the lowliest freshman to the largest cor
poration president. We have known him to
make appointments with students after his
working hours just s80 he can have time to
devote to their questions

There ife no words fo expres tii freat

satisfaction we have in knowing that such a

 

dynami man will be leading W i
Lee toward the future, using the past as a
guideline, but not depending on it. We now
have a man who will progress with the « f
changing times instead of resting on the

glories of the past.

ianism. He declared that there could be no sectarian
“limitation” at Washington nad Lee. He thus stated
delicately: “Born of piety and love of education which
marked the first settlers in this region, this school en-
joyed the friendship and, at times, the official patronage
of the church to which those settlers were so strongly
attached. It can never forget that obligation, and it has
endeavored to repay it by educating some of the greatest
men in the annals of that church, But later friends and
benefactors have been limited to no denomination, and,
as these memorial portraits show, to no section of our
country.”

He traced the slow and painful recovery of South-
ern colleges and universities in the post-bellum epoch,
handicapped as they were at the time he spoke by woe-
fully inadequate financial resources. Despite their dif-
ficulties, he said, these institutions achieved highly credit-
able work “in the most important and immediately use-
ful branches of education.”

The inauguration exercises occupied three hours,
and after Wilson had taken the oath of office, the guests
wended their way to the then existent old college gym-
nasium for the banquet. That building had been decorat-
ed under the direction of Miss Annie White, the librarian,
the tables accommodated 350, including invited students,
and all engaged in an excellent dinner. At the time for
toasts and speeches, when President Wilson rose to
introduce President Daniel Coit Gilman of John Hop-
kins, a cloudburst upon the tin roof of the gymnasium
drowned all efforts to speak. But Dr. Gilman “was seen
to extend his arms toward his hearers as if laying them
all under the spell of his words,” He carried on the
patomine with great verve, which elicited rounds of
applause from most of the audience, although some in
the rear, believing him to be speaking, called “louder.”

The storm, which brought much-needed rain to the
drought-stricken area, soon passed and a dozen or so
brief responses to toasts were made.

Denny Becomes President

In ill-health the several years during his presidency
at Washington and Lee, President Wilson died in 1900,
and after a brief interregnum, Dr. George Hutcheson
Denny, became acting president in 1901 for a year
and was then chosen President shortly afterward. It
was characteristic of President Denny that his formal
induction into office in June 1902, should have been
lacking in pomp and ceremonial usual to such occasions.
Only the official representatives of the five educational
institutions most closely associated with Washington and
Lee were present: Professor W. E. Peters of the Uni-
versity of Virginia (President Denny's graduate teacher),
Dean Andrew Fleming West of Princeton (afterward
Woodrow Wilson's opponent), and President Venable
(University of North Carolina), Ira Remsen (Uohns
Hopkins), and Mcllwaine of Hampden-Sydney

President Denny's inaugural proved to be eloquent
and thought-provoking, and must have pleased his audi
tors, especially the clerical members of the Board of
Trustees. He called for godly instructors, a sound cur-
riculum, and a healthy spiritual atmosphere. Dr. Denny
spoke out against the notion that education could be
mere “intellectual refinement,” and condemned the deifi
cation of intellectual culture. Recalling that religion had
been a primal impulse in the planting of his institution,

he inveighed against the skeptical contemporary age, an
era whose motto he said was, “Doubt your beliefs and

 

Dr. George H. Denny (1902-1911)

believe your doubts.” a time which had changed the
Cross into an interrogation point. Noting that many

people preached the idea that science was the religion

f oday and tomorrow Dr. Denny offered no ob

   

jection to science itself bul opposed its “guesses There
could be. he verted, no real conflict between science
ind religious faith: each could operate in its own sphere
but science should not invade that of religion

inaugural address, Dr. Smith developed briefly ideas of
higher education which were to become familiar to his
associates in Lexington. With a vividness of phrase
peculiarly his own, Dr. Smith analyzed deplorable con-
ditions of undergraduate life as “a unique combination
of social loafing, childish frivolity, degrading dissipation,
and strenuous athletics; where homeopathic doses of
intellectual discipline (were) adminisitered by discouraged
physicians to unwilling patients when more important
activities allow...” Thousand were being taught to loaf
and to play ball, but colleges did not fit them for the
fierce competition of professional and business life.

The Washington and Lee president foresaw a new
place and function for the American college. In the face
of lamentable “opposition of old-time college faculties”
(some of whom regrettably were to turn up in the Wash-
ington and Lee faculty!), the spirit of modern times
transformed our political, industrial, and educational
institutions. Higher education must adapt itself to the
needs and call of a new social and civic order; and
apparently this ferment presented colleges with an op-
portunity, Dr. Smith distinctly disapproved the notion
that the college campus should prepare students solely
for graduate work or even exclusively for the learned
professions,

 

Dr. Francis P. Gaines (1930-1959)

As Dr. Smith unfolded his plans at Washington
and Lee, he chose to stress successively applied learn
ing and sciences. The core of President Smith's educa
tional program consiisted in administrative emphasis
upon engineering, commerce (lo an extent), and journal
ism—the last-named occupying the president's curricular
interest during the twenties

Regarding that controversial topic ever so neat
and dear to alumni hearts, college athletics, Dr. Smith
clearly stated his desire to develop the individual through
bodily training and exercise. In this connection the presi
dent criticized what he called the one-sided and narrow
inter-collegiate athletic program, which he correctly be
lieved had been allowed to gain headway through lack
of faculty sympathy and control. Yet even this he did not
entirely condemn. The social and recreational ispects
of college life he desired to improve through guidance in
“this world in miniature After remarks critical of
campus “atmosphere” (how often this recurs!), where
students were satisfied with the “Gentlemen's erade of
‘D” (ater to be inflated to “C"), Dr. Smith launched
into his peroration, in which he descanted upon the
hallowed associations of Lexington, and the omnipresent
inspiration of the lives of Lee and Jackson-—a theme of
which he never wearied

Smith Retires

Upon the retirement of President Smith at th
close of 1929, Dr. Francis Pendleton Gaines, President
of Wake Forest College, accepied election to the presi
dency of Washington and Lee, taking up his duties in
the summer of 1930. The youthful and eloquent Presi
dent Gaines took the oath of office in his inaugural
ceremonies on Saturday morning, October 25, 1930. A
galaxy of distinguished delegates and speakers attended,
proceeding from the Lee Chapel, where Dr. Gaines was
sworn in, to the Doremus gymnasium. There a number
of addresses were delivered by Chancellor Kirkland of
Vanderbilt (who had spoken so wisely thirty-three years
before at President Wilson's inauguration), President
Frank P. Graham of the University of North Carolina
General John A. Lejeune of V. M. I. (who spoke for the
Virginia institutions of higher learning), and John W
Davis for the Washington and | ilumni, President
Gaines inaugural address concluded this phase of the
day's activities, and expression of lofiy idealism eloqu
ently phrased, A luncheon for delegates and others was
held on campus, at which Dr. John H. Finley, editor
of the New York Times spoke with warm appreciation

of the history of the Univer y and of its new leader!

Literary Magazine ‘Ariel’
Soliciting Student Works
For Autumn Publication

Ariel, the student literary maga-
zine, is soliciting manuscripts for the
autumn issue.

Editor Bernie Feld said
poetry, fiction, critical essays,
pen and ink drawings may be sub-
mitted to the Ariel box on the first
floor of Payne Hall behind the in-
formation desk.

Essays written for English courses
along with any other original unpub-
lished work is acceptable for con-
sideration, Feld said.

Each manuscript should be sub-
mitted typed, double-spaced and
should not be signed. Each author
should submit a separate envelope
containing his name and the title or
titles of the work submitted.

Peace Corps Officer

Professor Delos Hughes of the
Political Science Department is re-
placing Professor Milton Colvin as
Peace Corps liaison officer for the
Washintgon and Lee campus, Students
interested should get in touch with
Professor Hughes. His office is in
Newcomb Hall.

Professor Colvin pointed out that
in a six year span W&L has had many
students serve in the Peace Corps
and has never had a man who failed
to stay with the course. Washington
and Lee also has never had an appli-
cant rejected by the Peace Corps.

Applicants should realize that Peace
Corps service is not in lieu of mili-
tary service and applicant must ar-
range deferments with their own draft
boards. Deferment is not automatic,
but in general Boards have granted
deferments upon evidence of actual
acceptance into the Peace Corps.

easily as VMI showed tremendous
spirit and hustle in fighting the Gen-
erals all the way. Although down
at halftime, they were cheered on by
an army of Keydets and controlled
the third quarter. It was not until
early in the fourth quarter, after the
Keydets had blown a golden scoring
opportunity by missing a penalty shot,
that W&L was able to regain the
initiative. The Blue was further hurt
by an addition to the W&L “casual-
ty list.” This time the victim was the
goalie, All-American Candidate Tom
Mitchell, who has something wrong
with one of his eyes. Ken Newman
did a fine job in replacing him, how-
ever.

This Saturday the Generals will be
in action again, this time against Roa-
noke, the number one team in the
state. Washington and Lee will be
facing several All-Americans and
certainly face a severe test. How-
ever, with the possible return of
Scott Fechnay, continued team im-
provement, and tremendous hustle the
Blues cannot be counted out.

Looking Back:

Past Inaugurations

(Continued from Page 2)

June of that year the trustees an-
nounced that Dr. Fred C. Cole, Aca-
demic Vice-President of the Tulane
University of Louisiana, had accepted
their invitation to become the nine-
teenth president of the venerable
institution. The inauguration of Dr.
Cole tok place on the front campus
lawn on May 7, 1960, in which the
usual academic procession of delegates
and faculty participated, and which
was concluded by addresses by Presi-
dent Nathan M. Pusey of Harvard
University and by President Cole’s
inaugural speech. Each speaker ex-
amined the purpose of an American
college such as Washington and Lee,
and President Cole underscored aca-
demic integrity. A luncheon at the
Evans dining hall on campus wound
up this occasion,

Cole Resigns
Dr. Cole’s resignation in May 1967
resulted in the election of Dean Rob-

ert E. R. Huntley of the Washington
and Lee School of Law as the twent-
ieth President of Washington and
Lee, whose inauguration took place
today, October 18, 1968. It followed
many of the features which have be-
come a pattern for such affairs as
described above. All at Washington
and Lee will wish for a successful
and happy occasion on that day, to-

gether with a long and _ prosperous
administration for our new = and
youthful President.

“The way

I see it’

By REEVE KELSEY
News Editor

The IFC in one quick vote last
night eliminated all of the work and
thought devoted to deferred rush by
its own deferred rush committee. The
IFC with only two houses dissenting
voted to tentatively endorse the Hos-
ford-Stovall plan for limited contact,

[his plan is essentially a compro-
mise plan and as such it does not
have the advantages to the fraterni-
ties of the no contact plan or the
advantages to the freshmen of an
unlimited contact. This plan will work,
but its results wil be disastrous. Be-
sides no provision for fair distribu-
tion of the freshmen during the four
parties they are allowed to go to, the

fraternity itself has no idea how
many are coming to the party. The
mechanics of the parties are now

written so loosely as to be disad-
vantageous to the nine houses away
from campus. If the mechanics of the
parties are tightened to create so ad-
vance control over who is coming
and who is not, the ensuing bureau-
cracy becomes almost prohibitive.

1 myself would rather spend the
four party weekends partying, not

rushing. If the purpose of the party |

weekends is to rush the freshmen, I
would much rather do in under the
deferred rush committee plan at the
end of the first semester. If the pur-
pose of the party weekends is to
provide the freshmen a place to party,
then it seems that the IFC has adopt-
ed the concept that the social life
of all the students at W&L is the
responsibility of the fraternities, when,
in fact, this responsibility is the Uni-
versity’s. Why not put pressure on
the University to improve the dormi-
tory and social facilities.

rhe Hosford-Stovall plan is open|

to the dangers of “combo escala-
tion,” and the “beer only” rule for
freshmen is one of the more ridcul-
ous attempts of the whole proposal.
Are the freshmen going to appreciate
being served beer; will the fraterni-
ties not find some way to give their
favored rushees something other than
beer anyway? The authors of the
plan seem assured that $18 a man

is sufficient to replace the revenue |

of $100-$120 a man that most fra-
ternities earn from their pledge
classes in the first semester. The fi-

nancial objection is still there: why
do the fraternities have to pay for
the social life of the freshmen?

The plan ignores the problem of
freshmen going down the road. What
freshman going to refuse an in-
vitation from a fraternity to go down
the road? What fraternity is not going
to make sure that the rusheees it
likes do not have the opportunity to
go down the road on several nights
each week?

In summation, the only major dif-
ference between this plan and the
plan submitted by the deferred rush
committee is allowing freshmen four
party weekends on the fraternity’s
expense and allowing freshmen to go

Is

down the road with the fraternity
members. Fraternities will be forced
to be “rush conscious” during their
parties

The primray to determine the!
candidates for freshman class officers |
was held yesterday. A total of 246)
votes were cast, indicating that ap-|
proximately 67 percent of the fresh-|
man class participated in the pri-|
mary.

sentative to the Executive Commit. |

Charles Smith, Bob Humphreys, Bill

The combinaion of Smith-Hum-

Currently the VASG is engaged in
an effort to promote information
about the upcoming Virgina State

money which will be realized by the
proposed bonds will be used to help
finance state colleges. The VASG
therefore, is vitally concerned with

—Photo by Waelder

Tompkins proposes
constitutional change
for student approval

Joe Tompkins, sophomore repre-
sentative, has introduced an amend-
ment to the Student Body Consti-

tution to provide for the much need-
ed reform in electoral processes.

There will be a meeting Wednes-
day at 8 p.m. in duPont Hall to ex-
plain and discuss the amendments.
The voting on the amendment will
be Thursday. The text of the amend-
ment follows:

The last sentence of the fiirst para-
graph of Article Hl, Section B, Part
1 of the student body constitution
will be deleted and in its place will
be the following:

Said petition must be presented by

the third Monday in April, to be

fixed and publicized by the Exe-
cutive Committee as provided for

in Article Hl, Section C, Part 6.

The following sentence will be added
to Article Il, Section B, Part 3:
If a run-off election has to be held,
the person receiving the plurality
of the votes cast in the run-off will
be declared elected.
The following paragraph will be add-
ed to the student body constitution
as Part 9 of Article IV, Section C:
The number of positions to be
voted upon will determine the num-
ber of persons’ names placed on the
ballot for the general election. If
there are two positions to be filled
there should be no more than four
names placed on the ballot for
said positions. If there is one posi
tion to be filled, there should be
no more than two names placed
on the ballot for that position. If
more than four persons, or more
than two persons, depending on
the number of positions to be filled,
request that their names be placed

The Executive Committee of the
faculty yesterday rejected the IFC’s
formal motion to create a joint fac-
ulty-student committee to study rush.
Instead it said that it would be will-
ing to consult with a committee ap-
pointed by IFC president, Clark
Carter, to give the IFC further guid-
ance in forming a deferred rush plan.

The IFC then tentatively approved
the Hosford-Stovall plan (See Page
Two) for deferred rush, this plan
allows freshmen four party weekends
at the fraternities in the first semester.
The motion to approve the basic
structure of the Hosford-Stovall plan
was passed with only two dissenting
votes moments after the plan sub-
mitted by the deferred rush commit-
tee had been resoundingly crushed.

The probable members of the stu-
dent committee that will consult with
the executive committee of the fac-
ulty are Mike Hosford, Dave Stovall
(co-authors of the newly adopted
plan), Chuck Kahn (junior justice and
member of the deferred rush com-
mittee), Danny Leonard (one of the
major backers of last week's IFC
resolution), Herb Crenshaw, and John
Carrere.

The meeting between the faculty
and the student group will attempt to
determine an exact interpretation of
what the faculty actually meant in
its resolution and to assure the sup-
port of the faculty executive com-
mittee for the plan before it is sub-
mitted to the faculty as a whole.

Carter also hoped that if the fac-
ulty Executive Committee and the
students could agree that a mid-
semester rush would be equally ad-
vantageous to the University; and
that the faculty committee would en-

dorse The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
Plan as outlined in last week's edi-
torial page by Larry Honig along

with a plan that would postpone rush
for a full semester. The IFC vote on
the Hosford-Stovall plan was to give
the members of the committee deal-
ing with the faculty a basic indication
of the general will of the IFC as to
no, limited. or open contact.

Ihe IFC now plans to submit to
the faculty some variation of the Hos-
ford-Stovall plan (one semester pledg-
ing) with a strong endorsement for
The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi plan
(mid-semester pledging). The IFC
hopes to obtain the support of the
faculty Executive Committee’ with
| this strategy.

In other action Dean Atwood warn-
ed that fraternity feuding had broken

out again and that if it did not stop

immediately there would be strong
action taken by the SAC and the

IFC judicial board. Clark Carter add-
ed that this was definitely not the
time for the fraternities to become
involved in petty feuds, Dean At-
wood also noted that there were 5
violations of the 3 a.m. rule for
girls leaving the fraternity houses last
weekend. He felt that the University
proctor was doing his best to keep
the houses within the rules but with-
out enforcing the penalties. Dean
Atwood said if fraternities continued
to ignore Mr. Murray's request that
girls be out of the houses by 3 a.m.
the judicial board and the SAC
would have to take action.

A motion was introduced to peti-
tion the SAC and the faculty to
repeal the regulation forbidding girls
above the ground floor of the fra-
ternity houses. It was said that if this
regulation could be repealed that the
balance between upper classmen and
sophomores would be corrected. Dean
Atwood replied that this motion had
a fair chance of passing if the fra-
ternties would guarantee that signifi-
cantly more upperclassmen would
live in. This motion was tabled until
after the deferred rush debate had
been settled.

In final action, Chuck Kahn moved
the IFC sponsor a shoe race during
the half-time on next week's football
game. Two pledges from each fra-
ternity will be at one end of the field
while all their shoes will be at the
other end in a pile. The first team to
put on their shoes and run back to
the other end wins. This motion was
passed.

Honor violations
at Openings

The EC recently passed a reso-
lution which makes it an honor
violation for a student to pledge
that he has purchased a Dance Plan
when he has not. In the past
many students were able to get into
the concerts merely by claiming
that they had purchased a Dance
Pian and had forgotten to bring it
with them, It will also be an honor
offense to 1) purchase a guest ticket
for use by a WA&L student, 2) use
a guest ticket if you are a student;
3) use someone else's card to ob-
tain admission to any concert; and
4) allow your card te be used by
anyone other than yourself.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper
Tuesday, October 22, 1968

 

Some necessary concessions,
or, how student government
can become more than a phrase

Democracy is based upon the conviction
that there are extraodinary possibilities
in ordinary people.

—Harry Emerson Fosdick

Speaking on behalf of the Executive Committee at fresh-
man camp this September, Steve Sandler said “There is no
student government at Washington and Lee.” His point was
that 12 students—albeit capable students—have charge of pro-
tecting the interests of 1,458 men. And he wasn’t far from
the truth.

The interested reader would now call attention to those
less direct forms of student government: various committees
appointed by the EC (i.e., Student Control, Assimilation, Cur-
riculum, Library, and Cold Check), the two Ring-tum Phis,
the Inter-Fraternity Council, and the Student Affairs Com-
mittee (student and faculty membership); and in so doing
would hope to show that Washington and Lee men do have
a participating role in their own affairs.

But do they, really? A few examples:

‘@5 The student Curriculum Committee, under the superb
and brilliant leadership of chairman Swede Henberg, is not
allowed to participate in meetings of the faculty Curriculum
Committee. Let’s suppose Mr. Henberg has an idea—any idea
—backed by his group. How may he present it to the faculty
for consideration? He may:

1) ask the EC to endorse it, which endorsement is mean-
ingless unless an interested faculty member decides to introduce
it to his peers, or unless the EC creates a big to-do and is
allowed to make a special in-person appeal; or,

2) appear before the faculty Curriculum Committee and
present the case, which presentation obviously will not be as
complete or as convincing were the faculty members them-
selves allowed to trace its development; or,

3) write about it in one of The Ring-tum Phis; or,

4) forget it.

@5 The student body’s choice of a plan for a five-day week
will be presented to the faculty only after a unanimous endorse-
ment by the EC, intervention by a sympathetic Dean of Stu-
dents, and an editorial which cost this editor a few friends.
‘@5 The IFC has no direct communication with the faculty.
What the IFC is thinking and what it wants are discovered by
the faculty via one of The Ring-tum Phis, Dean Atwood, or
president Clark Carter who has an ex officio position on the
Student Affairs Committee.

‘@5 The student body usually finds out what the faculty is
thinking after the thinking is finished and the decisions made.
Faculty meetings are closed and the minutes are secret.

‘@5 The editors of the student newspapers are given no
official sounding board for what are often ideas in the best
interest of the University at large.

We read last week with jealousy an article in The New
York Times which discussed a survey of 4,014 university ad-
ministrators, faculty members, students, and trustees, conduct-
ed by the American Council on Education. Excerpts:

[there is} overwhelming agreement that students will and should
‘serve as voting members on most important academic committees
_.. two out of three administrators—and a slightly higher propor-
tion of faculty—believe this development is desirable or essential.’

We would venture that few students want to control all
the administrative and legislative processes of Washington and
Lee. What we as students would like, though, is the opportunity
to be listened to and to listen, because we feel competent to
participate, and we feel the University disallows our participa-
tion at the peril of student/ W&L relations.

We suggest the following, and sincerely believe that each
is obtainable and necessary:

—limited student voting membership on the faculty Cur-
riculum Committee, the Committee on Courses and Degrees,
and any committee in the future which has to do with affairs
of interest to a majority of students;

—amalgamation of the faculty Library Committee with the
Student Library Committee;

consolidation of the Student Control Commitee with the
Student Affairs Committee, with students in a majority;

——a regular report in person to the faculty by the Executive
Commitee; and,

—the privilege of attendance at faculty meetings granted
to the president of the IFC, the president, vice president, and
secretary of the student body, and the editors of The Ring-
tum Phis.

Thursday's vote

Thursday the student body will be given an opportunity to
vote yea or nay on a proposed amendment to the constitution,
which amendment will, if passed, provide for selection of office
holders by plurality vote in runoff elections.

Such a provision seemed unnecessary until last year, when
write-in votes for president of the student body denied a ma-
jority to the front-runner. The situation was settled, but not
without some debate.

730 affirmative votes will be necessary to affect this needed
change—we join the Executive Committee in urging everyone
in the University to drop by a ballot box Thursday and vote in
favor of the amendment.

Why is apartment living far more
desirable than the dorms or the fra-
ternity houses? The question is not
posed in innocence; the answer is
patently obvious—the University’s re-
strictions on the fraternity houses and
the dormitories make apartments
much more attractive. In apartments
the student has the freedom to do
what he choses; he can decorate it as
he choses; he can make whatever
noise he wants when he wants to
(within civilized restrictions) and
most important, he may entertain
females in his apartment.

Dormitories are the least desirable
of the living quarters. No liquor or
beer is allowed; the student is limited
in the type of decorations he can use;
he has no choice over those he has
to live with. There are no other
facilities besides the shower room
down the hall and the small cubicle
called a room. It is very obvious
why a majority of the W&L students
opt for non-dormitory housing at the
first opportunity.

Fraternity houses solve most of the
problems and horrors of the dormi-
tory housing. Girls are not, however,
allowed above the ground floor of
the fraternity houses. Therefore, as
soon as a fraternity member has ful-
filled his obligation to the house to

University urged to relax
regulations on fraternities

live in for a year or two, he im-
mediately moves to an apartment
where he can live completely free of
any hindering regulations. This com-
plete freedom is the main attraction
of the apartments.

The fraternity houses are increas-
ingly becoming less and less the cen-
ter of the students’ life and increas-
ingly a place to eat and hear a combo
play on weekends. Very often, in fact,
fraternity houses become deserted
during the last hour of a combo
party as students and their dates
head out toward the best ‘party apart-
ments.’

Article 7 of a report entitled “Sub-
committee Report to the Student
Affairs Committee” which deals with
fraternity self-improvement and was
published last year states: “Each chap-
ter should seek to balance house resi-
dents between seniors and sopho-
mores, adding juniors as needed to
establish an upperclass majority, by
providing incentives for those seniors
and juniors best qualified to help in
the development of underclassmen to
live in the chapter house and be re-
sponsible for the individual develop-
mental programs of the underclass-
men, with particular emphasis on atti-
tudes and conduct.”

How can the University expect
upperclassmen to give up the potent-

McGuire answers Yevich
about Saturday classes

Robert Yevich, Editorial-Page Editor:

As the Tuesday Edition has for
some time now publicized and sup-
ported the Lynchburg plan of class
blocking I think both you and your
readers are due some explanation as
to why this plan is not recommended
to the faculty by the Five-Day-Week
Committee.

If 50 minutes (about the minimum)
are allowed for lunch on the Lynch-
burg plan, the class day does not
end at 1:20 p.m. as suggested by you
but at 5:00 p.m. You seem remark-
ably well insulated to the fact that
close to half of our students and a
considerable portion of our faculty
members are involved in afternoon
class or lab work at the present time.

Late afternoon classes now let out
at 4:40 p.m. This is a disadvantage
to students who wish both to take
work offered in the afternoon and to
participate in extracurricular activi-
ties—most notably athletics. A 5:00
p.m. closing time would compound
this difficulty. All of the plans seri-
ously considered by the committee
close the class day at about 4:00 p.m.
and disallow the regular scheduling
of extracurricular activities prior to
that time.

A variety of other criticism was
brought against the Lynchburg plan,
none of which seemed too important
to me, In any case the one outlined

 

(Editor's note: the following is a proposal for deferred
rush introduced at last night's IFC meeting by Dave
Stovall and Mike Hosford, It is different from the
proposals of the Deferred Rush Committee, but it
is within the framework of the faculty resolution of
May, 1967.)

a 3 *

By DAVE STOVALL
IFC Member

and MIKE HOSFORD
IFC Member

This proposal grew out of disenchantment with the
no-contact plan presented by the IFC Deferred Rush
Committee and from the lack of any other plan which
satisfied the faculty’s provisions. We feel that we have
a plan that will cause a minimum amount of trouble
in its institution for a number of reasons.

First, it is equitable. Every house has an equal
chance to meet and woo the freshmen. This is the rea-
son bus service to and from the girls’ schools has to
be provided, and also in-town bussing on party week-
ends, to help those houses who are further out than
others.

Second, it is reasonably enforceable, where the no-
contact plan was not. We feel that with limited contact
on the campus, on party weekends, and at other specified
times, control will be less a problem than with the no-
contact plan. You will always have some problem in a
community so small in size and number.

Third, it requires a strong student to be pledged
into a fraternity. Obviously, academic orientation is the
faculty’s main concern in regard to fraternity rush. With
pledging not until second semester after a relaxed first
semester, there hopefully will be greater academic effort
on the part of the freshman. With a 2.0 required to
pledge, a freshman has to work hard. We hope this
meets with the faculty's approval.

Fourth, there is no undue strain on either the fresh-
men or the fraternities. Open houses and smokers are
set up on Friday nights, and the other contact is on party
weekends. This causes no strain either academically,
socially, or financially, (We are also bucking for abolition
of Saturday classes!)

Fifth, it has a flexible but permanent calendar. This
allows long range advance p'anning for both the fraterni-
ties and the administration.

We feel this plan is the closest one possible in re-
gard to the benefits to the fraternities, the freshmen,
and the University as a whole. It alleviates the problem

Another rush proposal

of large scale university sponsored entertainment for
freshmen. It provides the academic orientation needed
for the freshmen. It offers the best program with the
fewest problems. We just hope you like it. It is the
only alternative.

@ There will be a rush registration fee of twenty-three
dollars ($23.00), $5.00 of which goes to the IFC, $18.00
of which is divided equally among the fraternities, to
be paid by each student going through rush before the
first day of classes.

@ The first three Fridays after the start of classes shall
consist of open houses. Each open house shall be of one
hour duration, including transportation to and from the
fraternity houses. No more than thirty rushees may be
present at any one house.

@ No rushee may visit a single fraternity more than
once during the first three weeks of rush (no more than
one open house may be attended.) A rushee is required
to see a minimum of twelve (12) houses during the three
Friday nights of open houses.

@ There will be no fraternity or individually sponsored
parties for the purpose of rush during the summer,
Thanksgiving vacation, or Christmas vacation.

@ There will be no communication with new men after
their arrival in Lexington, in any manner, until the start
of classes for the fall semester, after which contact is
limited to areas on the campus other than the dormi-
tories, and to fraternity houses at the specified times.
No rushee shall be allowed in fraternity houses at other
than the specified times, nor in the lodging of any
upperclassmen (other than fraternity houses) for the
duration of rush through the first week of the second
semester.

@ All rushing will end at 11:00 p.m. on the first
Wednesday after the start of the second semester. No
upperclassman or active or alumni member of any chap-
ter may enter the dorms from 11:00 p.m. Wednesday
until 5:00 p.m, on Friday.

@ Fraternity members shall not be allowed to enter the
dorms at any time during the first semester, except
dormitory counselors or members of the IFC Rush Com-
mittee. During the first three class days of the second
semester, fraternity men may enter the dorms between
the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. only for the
purpose of issuing bids to the rushees. During this time,
a maximum of six (6) members from each fraternity
shall be allowed to enter the dorms with the time
allowed not to exceed twenty (20) minutes, No official
bids ws be extended to any rushee except during this
period.

Unfortunately, due to space limitations the entire
proposals cannot be published.

Smith blasts EC’s failure
to meet responsibility

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

Once again the EC has shown that
it has nothing new to say on the
question of race relations at Wash-
ington and Lee and the Lexington
community. Last spring, at that time
the only black student on this campus,
I raised certain questions with the
EC concerning its responsibility for
leadership in meeting the problems
that would accompany the changing
complexion of the W&L student body.
Last Tuesday the new EC made its
attitude known,

Steve Sandler, a member of that
body, proposed that the EC adopt
a statement similar to that of the
IFC concerning housing discrimina-
tion against Negro girls from  sur-
rounding schools. His resolution
would ask all girls to patronize only
those houses in Lexington which
would be willing to take girls on a
nondiscriminatory basis. In addition,
the EC was asked to help the IFC
compile and make available a list of
those houses. This the EC refused to
do. Like its predecessor before it,
the EC sought refuge in the self-
serving declaration that no problem
exists and that even if it does, why

Powell criticizes faculty
for ignoring students

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

After having read the Oct. 15 issue
of The Ring-tum Phi, I have been
prodded to write an open letter to the
faculty concerning some rather blatant
inconsistencies in their recent be-
havior. Lately the student body has
been confronted with that lack of
understanding and almost absolute re-
jection of student proposals which no
doubt led to problems in other uni-
versities such as Columbia. This is
not to say | advocate the measures
employed there at all, I don't, it
just seems the faculty is determined
to irritate the student body.

In his article, Dr. Schwab makes
this rather absolute statement: “...
Washington and Lee will have de-
ferred rush next fall...” There is
no room for discussion left open,

Barr notes merits
of deferred rush

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

May I begin this letter by saying
that I am basically in favor of de-
ferred rush.

As the faculty asserts, it will pre-
sumably give the freshman a better
look at the various fraternities, and
vice-versa. Consequently, in theory if
not in fact, the fraternities would
experience fewer pledges who decide
that they are in the wrong house and

S the crux of the faculty's argument.

Under the current proposal _ con-
tact would exist between the fresh-
men and upper classes, And, as a
result, there would be less distraction
in order that the freshman might be-
come more academically oriented. The
idea that the freshman start on his
studies rather than pledging is rather
enhancing. but how many freshmen
are going to study until November?

Would there not be other distrac
tions, Le. Doe's, the new Union, of

Soccer game with Roanoke
postponed because of storm
causes scheduling problems

Washington and Lee’s soccer squad
| lost its chance on Saturday to add
an important win to its record. The
Generals were slated to go against
Roanoke College, one of the toughest
teams on their schedule, in Roanoke.
The game was called early Saturday
morning on account of rain.

Coach Lyles of W&L was extremely
unhappy with the decision. “This is
the first time I’ve ever heard of can-
celling a soccer game for rain. At
least they could have given us a little
more notice.” As a result, the Blue
will probably not be able to re-
schedule the Roanoke game. The
| booters have several games left, and
|another game added to their plans
would be very tiring.

The Generals next game will be
Friday afternoon against Virginia
Tech, here at W&L. By that time, all
ailing players should be recovered
enough to play, including Scott
Fechnay who should be back in con-

Washington and Lee’s much-herald-
ed defense finally came through in
Saturday's Homecoming match-up
with Hampden-Sydney, but so did
the Tigers’. In a rather dreary mud
bath, the Generals were only able to
salvage a scoreless tie. There wasn't
a single serious scoring threat by
either side in the entire game.

The rains came Friday morning
and lasted until just before gametime.
As the mist finally stopped, a steady
stream of old grads, mingled with a
few die-hard students, slowly began
to fill a few stadium seats. Total at-
tendance was around 2500, not over-
whelming for a Homecoming game.

When the kickoff finally came,
about an hour late, nobody was
able to do much of anything. Foot-
holds were impossible, the turf was
chewed to pieces, and an air attack
was next to impossible.

It seemed in the opening minutes
as if the Generals were in for a

itself in the position of spoiler. After receiving permission
Thursday to use the upper practice field and the limer for a
rugby game on Saturday with Richmond, Rugby Club presi-
dent and freshman soccer coach Tim Henry was told shortly
before game time that the field could not be used. The Rich-
mond team had arrived and was forced to return without
having played.

The reasons for refusing use of the field are unimportant.
Washington and Lee’s Rugby Club had been given the word
of the department; what’s more, permission was rescinded too
late to change any plans. The recalcitrant attitude of Mr.
Twombly is typified in his words to the club, ‘I don’t give a
damn if they came from Toronto.”

rushed, and the Generals took over
on their own 42. This was a situation
that was repeated many times to both |
sides. |

The Blue made no yardage what- |
soever. Their punt carried to the |
Hampden-Sydney 25, and the Tigers |
were on the march once again. A key |
run by halfback Jim Whorley took |
the visitors to the W&L 40, before the |
defensive unit began to dig in. A
blitz, alert linebacking, and offsides
and illegal motion penalties, all com-|
bined to put H-S in a fourth and |
seventeen situation. |

The Generals came back on the |
field in the second half determined |
to get some points. They failed to
move on their first series from scrim- |
mage, but the defense kept Hampden- |
| Sydney bottled up deep in their own |
territory. The Tigers punted and W&L |
had the ball on the H-S 45. Joe
Dozier gave the Blue a first down on |
the 34 with runs of six and five
yards, Another run and a short pass
to Bucky Cunningham by Chuck
Kuhn gave the Generals a fourth and
three on the 21. Lacking a field-goal
specialist, the decision was to go for
the first down. Joe Dozier took the
hand-off and drove into the line. The
chains were brought out and the
measurement was debated over by
the players and referees. The Blue
were just shy, and Hampden-Sydney
took possession.

Once again the game stalemated.
As the quarter was drawing to a
close, the Tigers had finally put some
yardage between themselves and their
own goal. With the ball on his 40,
Beale fumbled the slippery ball, and
Dean Kumpuris recovered for the
Generals on the H-S 38. With three
straight carries, Dozier made it to the
26 for a first down. Once again the
Blue had a chance to score. Quarter-
back Kuhn overthrew Cunningham
around the ten, but bucked the line
on the next play to make it to the
23. With third and seven WAL en-
countered the same ball-handling dif-
ficulties which had given them the
ball. Split end Rick McMillan couldn't
hang on to a soggy pass, and the
home team was in a fourth down
situation once again. Jack Baizley |
came in at quarterback, but the pass!
from center slipped away in the mud, |

Steel Plant Loopers, who comprise a majority of the average loop class of 150 to 200 graduates,
proceed to various plants where they go through a brief orientation program before beginning
their on-the-job training assignments. Within a short time after joining the course, most loopers
are ready for assignments aimed toward higher levels of management.

How about other loopers? Our Sales Department loopers (30 or so) remain at the home office for
about a year of training. Most are then assigned to district offices where they take over established

accounts.

Fabricated Steel Construction loopers are trained in a drafting room, on a field erection project,
in a fabricating shop, and in an engineering office. A looper’s first work assignment is based on

convenience due to archaic local so-
cial customs. Yet, only one member
of that august body which purports
to speak for the students of this uni-
versity recognized the EC’s responsi-
bility to do what could be done to
avoid further situations of this kind.
Sandler is to be commended for his
farsighted and responsible position,
in view of the callous and irrespon-
sible attitude of the other members.
He appears to be unaffected by the
chloroform of conformity which grips
the EC,

What bizarre reasoning was put
forward as a basis for the EC vote
against Sandler's resolution, Hend-
ricks is quoted as saying that
impetus should come from W&L in
this matter,” Leonard takes the posi-
tion that it would do nothing “but
disturb a lot of women,” while
Simmons refuses to acknowledge that
a problem exists. I have heard that
last argument too many times, It is
beginning to sound like a broken
record. In my opinion, the reasons
advanced only thinly veil the EC's
eagerness to sweep this matter under
the rug. Thus a weak-kneed EC with
no stomach for taking a moral stand
choose the easier road of acquiescing
in racial bigotry.

By bowing to the prejudices of
local matrons, the EC has placed its
stamp of approval upon their actions.
The Friday Editor rightly states that

“by rejecting this motion, the EC
which is the voice of the student
body, has approved of the situation as
it now exists. In effect, the EC’s de-
cision states that W&L favors dis-
crimination and is not in favor of
changing housing policies.”

We do not exist here in an isolated
vacuum, Others outside our com-
munity are interested in our actions.
Earlier this year, President Huntley
pledged that Washington and Lee
would meet the challenges before it.
Presently our university is striving to
attract and keep students of racial
minority background who are cap-
able of benefitting from and con-
tributing to the educational experi-
ence at Washington and Lee.

The EC should reverse its posi-
tion and thus make it possible to
advance this goal. Certainly, these
students would have cause for hesita-
tion about attending here if it appears
that the student establishment with its
power to mold student opinion would
not be willing to protect the interests
of the entire student body.

The EC should reverese its posi-
tion with all deliberate speed. In
doing so, it would be serving the best
interests of this university. Washing-
ton and Lee need not stand mute
when local attitudes threaten its self-
interest. We are moving into the last
quarter of the twentieth century,
either we take our stand now and
tell it like it is, or simply let the
world know that we are unwilling to
face the truth. Both the town of
Lexington and the EC seem to be un-
aware that the times, they are a’-
changing.

only that the event will occur, What |

you don't see mentioned, however, is
that Saturday classes will not exist
next fall. Why? I suggest that there
are some rather academic reasons for

 

Such ideas as the students would
have too much time on weekends to
play and that they might be tempted
to travel to far away places, or, that
some teachers, who have tenure, or
are afraid their daily routine might be
broken up, or, that the traditional
W&L that they knew forty years ago
will be lost. I submit these are not
valid excuses for maintaining an anti-
quated system of class blocking.

If the faculty passed the no Satur-
day classes rule, there would be more
time available for research by the
professors, but of course this might
mean they would have to publish and
this means extra work and therefore
is out of the question. Also by not
having Saturday classes, the weekday
classes would be longer, allowing for
a better discussion in class.

It also seems ludicrous to me
for the faculty to say it is not feasible
for W&L to change over when a
school almost eight times our size
did it without problem. What is so
difficult about having MWF classes
as usual and TTS classes meet for
longer periods on TT; we are in-
telligent people capable of adjusting,

The point I wish to convey is this:
the faculty has created a situation of
double standard and it doesn’t seem
appropriate that they should set them-
selves up as being perfect or even
totally open-minded, because they are
not. What I propose is that the faculty
realize that they too must change

and that W&L is behind other compet-

ing universities in many areas, and
these areas are perhaps more im-
portant to the total scope of the Uni-
versity than the idea of forcing fra-
ternities to accept deferred rush.

system.

I began this article saying that I
was in favor of deferred rush. In
spite of the above arguments, I still
am. Let rush start the second week-
end after classes begin. At U.Va.
deferred rush works successfully, and
successfully is the only way any sys-
tem can work,

Let rush begin the first weekend in
October, and let the fraternities choose
their method of rush. To keep up,
however, a combo would be necessary
on Saturday nights or no one would
come. Let rush last for six, or perhaps
eight, weeks with contact. This way
the freshman would have a way to

ever hope to reestablish the domi-
nance of upperclassmen in the fra-
ternity houses is by revoking all Uni-
versity regulations over the fraternity
houses and putting this power in the
hands of the IFC or the individual
fraternity houses.

There was a motion in the IFC last
night requesting that the Student
Affairs Committee or whichever body
in the University hierarchy has juris-
diction to reconsider this regulation.
Allowing girls in the upper floors of
the fraternity houses would definitely
stem the flow of upperclassmen out
of the houses. Allowing girls in the
dormitories would bring W&L out of

expend his energies other than over the Victorian age and into the con-

a book.

Probably the greatest criticism of
any deferred system of rush is the
cost, which would be even greater
than it is now. Most fraternities, since
they are not as large, generally, as
those at U.Va., could not effectively
make a go of deferred rush. In that
case, fraternities shall have to put
on an intense summer rush.

The faculty system as proposed is
absolutely ridiculous, both from our
and ostensibly the freshman’s point of
view. If, however, it is passed, we will
obviously have to live with it or die.
The faculty seems hell-bent on de-
ferred rush, but at our expense, not
theirs. Either petition for a_ better

system, if possible, or suggest the|*®

extention of the present one.

Lynchburg Plan
Wins First Vote

Ihe facully in a meeting as com
mittee of the whole Wednesday night
conditionally recommended the

Lynchburg College Plan—also known
as the Student Plan, the EC Plan and
the Ring-tum Phi Plan-—as a means
for abolishing Saturday classe

This plan calls for the alternation
of MWF and TT classes from weel
to week and would not result in any
regularly scheduled afternoon classes
thus requiring no change in the mas
ter schedule of courses and labs

It would not entail any additional

days of classes, as was the ise with

a similar plan

ee

The morning (A-J) classes will run
for 60 minutes each, and while sched

uled from 8 a.m. to 1:20 p.m. with
a fiveeminute break between each
class.

Afternoon (K-P) classes run from
5S pm. to 4:40 pm. do not

alternate from week to week, and are
50 minutes in length

Choose A Candidate--If You Can...

For many of us this will be our first op-
portunity to vote in a national presidential
election. And frankly, we are disillusioned.

We are disillusioned about the national
nominating conventions; we are disatisfied
with the hypocrisy of politics, i.e., saying one
thing to get votes and doing another; we
object to the electoral college which com-
pletely ignores the minority vote in a state;
and, above all, we are unhappy about the
candidates we have to choose from. We will
shed no tear at the repudiation of the incum-
bent Administration, and raise no cheer at
the prospect of Richard Nixon in the White
House.

Neither Humphrey nor Nixon has spok-
en the truth on Vietnam— that this never
was a war that should have been fought by
the United States. Nor has either said, even
in general terms, how he thinks the conflict
can be brought to an end without further loss
of life and destruction. Humphrey’s oppon-
ents argue that they have not been in charge
and are not therefore responsible for this
disaster. This is a valid but weak defense,
since neither Nixon nor Wallace has criticized
the essentials of the Johnson policy. They are
freer than Humphrey to speak, but they have
not said anything meaningful.

This does not make the Vice President
any less guilty. He, too, has had a chance to
get off the Johnson line. He might have en-
dorsed the moderate minority position on
Vietnam at the Democratic National Conven-
tion. Instead, he supported the extremists,
and he defended the police for clubbing and
gassing protesters in the streets. Our thoughts
on Humphrey are not enhanced when we
hear that privately he really has had grave
doubts about the bombing. The Administra-
tion policies to which Humphrey gave himself
ardently are now to be judged. This is the
way it should be. And this hurts him, too, un-
less he repudiates them.

Hubert Humphrey, we believe, is no war
lover. But neither is Nixon or Lyndon John-
son. (We can’t be sure about George Wallace
and his ridiculous sidekick LeMay.) We as-
sume that both of the major candidates would
get us out of Vietnam, because of strong
pressures to shift the balance of national
expenditures more heavily onto the side of
domestic issues. Militant protest will make a
new Administration’s life hard if it does not
make peace. In addition, any new Adminis-
tration will do something for the ghettoes.
Humphrey, the nominee more willing to use
public resources to meet public needs, has

For Your Vote Must Be Counted

By not coming out for any presidential
candidate, we don’t want to infer that we
should sit the election out. It would be a
catastrophe if everyone did this.

There are several reasons for voting this
year, even if none of the candidates is very
attractive. First, the freedom to vote for
whomever we wish is one of our most sacred
rights. We have this right and we should be
proud of it. We have defended and are de-
fending foreign countries so that they may
enjoy the same freedom.

A second reason why we should vote
is to make our voices heard in Congress.
There are many excellent candidates running
for Congressional seats who need our sup-
port. Even if we cannot get the man we want
for President, we may be able to get Con-
gressmen from our districts who sympathize
with us and will take our views to Washing-
ton. It is a disgusting thing for people to
complain about national policy when they

will not go out of their way to vote for the

made constructive proposals about federal
investment in urban renewal and education.
He has the confidence of the black communi-
ty, as the polls show Nixon does not, which
will help him in winning racial peace. In the
final analysis, racial peace will be won by
goodwill and good works, not by force.

This much being said, it must be added
that when the disarray of the Democratic
Party, the anger and frustration of the young,
the rise of right-wing radicalism and the prob-
ability of a more conservative Congress in
1969 are taken into account, it his hard to
visualize Humphrey’s gaining enough sup-
port as President to cope with our crises. Com-
mentators like Walter Lippman believe this.
He says that a Republican Administration
could more easily end the war without stirring
up the rabid anti-communists. In all his poli-
cies Nixon’s middle-of-the-road philosophy
would keep the country’s elements equally
appeased.

Nixon has evidently changed. He has be-
come more genial and secure. His organiza-
tion is flawless and he is surrounded by smart
people. But has he really changed? The mem-
ories of the past mar the picture for the
future. The record of Nixon’s rise to eminence
on the backs of suspected “subversives,” of
his uninvolvement with any of the central
problems of our society and of his showman-
ship in Latin America and in the Soviet
Union still linger with us.

His stands on current issues are vague.
If Nixon differs with the present Secretary
of State about the prudent use of American
military or diplomatic power, it is not evident.
His references to “de-Americanizing” the war
are unclear and sound like those of Johnson.
He is for civil rights, but would be reluctant
to use the money power of the federal gov-
ernment to see that they are enforced. He
offers his faith that subsidized free enterprise
will find jobs for the unemployed, educate
the poorly skilled and build low-income hous-
ing. At the same time, he suggests it can all be
done while raising defense expenditures, cut-
ting the budget and cutting taxes. He favors
“black capitalism,” but gives no clue to the
means by which poor Negroes, lacking funds
or managerial experience, are to create their
own businesses.

Then there’s Agnew. Compared to Mus-
kie . . . well, there is no comparison.
If we felt we could endorse either Hum-

phrey or Nixon, we would, Choose if you can.
We can’t.

candidates who will be entrusted with the re-
sponsibilities of representing them.

The most important reason for us to
vote is to stop George Wallace. It is imper-
ative we do this now or Wallace and his phil-
osophy will influence government policies for
many years to come. The larger the percen-
age of the vote Wallace compiles on election
day, the more influence he will hold. Many
people in this country will be voting for Wal-
lace either in protest of the other two candi-
dates or because they are scared of the black
man, Wallace is catering to these peoples’
emotions and is winning their votes.

It is up to us, as educated people, to see
through his fale, “home-spun” oratory. It is
important that we vote for the presidential

 

candidate in our respective states who has the
best chance of stopping the Wallace tide.

For those of us at Washington and Lee, |
the next four years will be important in de-|
termining our futures. To paraphrase one |
candidate, vote as if your world depended on |
it. It might.

 

Campaign ’68: 3 Hats In the Ring

 

Humphrey Faces Lots Of “Ifs”

By BOB GIAMMITTORIO

The Humphrey campaign now, a
little less than two weeks away from
election day, is beleagered ‘by many
“ifs.” If Nixon and Wallace don’t gain
any more, if Democrats get out and
vote, and if some of the labor vote
switches from Wallace, then Hubert
Humphrey will have a good chance
at the Presidency,

But the conjunction I prefer to use
regarding the campaign is “why.” Why
are so many people enamored by a
demogogue who promises changes he
will never be able to effect and who
threatens with a shaking fist the very
nature of our Democracy? Why are
so many people rallying behind a
third-rate politician who has no ma-
jor accomplishments to his credit in
the field of government and who buys
support by promising to cater to pri-
vate interests? Why have these people
sought to ignore the positive credent-
ials of a man who has had twenty
years of experience in all levels of
politics and public administration?

The answer is plainly that some
people have become dissatisfied with

Nixon’s

Richard Nixon is the candidate
who can best unite our country. It is
not trite campaign rhetoric to say
that our country has rarely been so
factionalized. Mr. Nixon as candidate
of the center can build a moderate
government capable of meeting the
challenges we face. Mr. Humphrey is
handicapped by his shattered party
and his espousal of the policies of
the 1930's. Mr. Wallace has no real
party and his policies could not be
implemented.

The campaign we are now witness-
ing is excellent testimony of Nixon's
ability to inspire unity. Who would
have thought that Strom Thurmond
and Nelson Rockefeller would ever
go to the stump for the same candi-
date? The Republican Party is united
and is prepared to assume power with
a broad-based electorate. The Nixon
Administration is preparing to infuse
Washington with many new bright
young faces with equally new ideas.
The United States has changed since
the 1930's the Nixonites are prepared
to introduce new policies,

the way that the Democrats have
been running the country for the last
eight years. This attitude, however,
is flatly unfounded and unrealistic.
How in a period of unequaled eco-
nomic prosperity and social equality
can the public want something dif-
ferent? The bone of contention can-
not be the War in Viet Nam because
the three candidates have presented
views on the war that are essentially
the same. One would suspect that
Nixon and Wallace have gathered
around them a group of selfish people
who are intent on serving their own
interests, whether they be re-insti-
tution of racial segreation, the stifl-
ing of the right to dissent or the

accumulation of private wealth.

The wide split in the differing ap-
proaches of Humphrey and his closest
rival can be exemplified by Nixon's

slogan “Vote as if your life depended
on it.” Nixon’s refusal to debate
whether or not he would sign a ban
on nuclear weapons, and his con-
tinued silence on his method of end-
ing the Viet Nam War all indicate
(Continued on Page 4)

peal Is

In absolute contrast to the Nixon
campaign is the dismal Humphrey
campaign, There are few new faces,
his policies promise more spending to
solve al Ithe problems, and the Demo-
cratic Party has rarely been in such
disarray. If Humphrey is elected he
will face a hostile Congress. Nixon
hopes for a Republican House, but
even if it is Democratic he will not
stir the antagonisms that Humphrey
will arouse. A Democrat House will
be that way only because of over-
whelming Southern membership. And
these Southerners will not identify
with Humphrey for fear of sure
electoral defeat.

There is litthe question that a Wal-
lace Administration would be the
most divisive. Regardless of his in-
tentions to “Stand Up For America”
the vast majority of Americans are
frightened of him. The Negro com-
munity I fear would rebel and so
would many alarmed citizens. Mr.
Wallace would only sharpen differ-
ences that now exist, for example his
Madison Square Garden rally Thurs-

Wallace: A Man Of The People

By STEVE DUGAN

This year, as in few years past,
America has a full-fledged three way
race for the Presidency. The Amer-
ican Independent Party of candidate
George C. Wallace is causing more
excitement than any political move-
ment in years.

Never before has a man come
close to doing what Governor Wal-
ace is doing this year. Starting with
nothing but a bad national image,
Walace has formed his own party,
met ballot requirements in all $0
states, set up a nationwide organiza
tion of political workers. named one
of America’s top military minds as
his Vice Presidential mate and col-
lected record donations from the
people throughout his campaign

No person with an open mind can
heip but realize that Mr. Wallace has
great support throughout the nation
If one doubts this, he need only fol-
low press accounts of the campaign
With few exceptions, the former Ala
bama Governor is out-drawing his

the polls now show Wallace with 20

What, politicians all over the

The answer to this question prob.

Wallace is talking straight to the
average man on the street. Wallace
realizes the problems the average
American is facing, he knows what
needs to be done to solve these prob-
lems and he uses brilliant campaign
rhetoric to convey his message. The

Lunch is from 1:20 p.m. to 1:55
p.m.

rhis plan is similar to the one pre-
sented to the faculty by Dr. Robert
S. Johnson, except that in his plan
there was no provision for a universal
lunch beark. Classes would have end-
ed at 4 p.m.

rhe plan, presented to the faculty
by student body president Jay Pas-
savant, will go to the faculty comit-
tee for the five-day week to have the
details of implementation worked out.
It will be submitted to the faculty
for final vote on November 4, pro-
vided the committee can finish its
work by then. If approved it will be
decided at that time when the pro-
gram, which can easily go into affect
next semester, will be started.

course which meets on Tuesday-
Thursday of the “A” week meets on
Monday-Wednesday-Friday on “B”
week. Although frightfully confusing
when explained in this manner, the
system is quite easy to institute and
has proven itself very operative.
Another departure from the ordi-
nary six-day schedule is the extension
of classes from fifty minutes to a
full hour. The result is that, in two
weeks of five days each, the course
has the same classroom time as it
had with Saturday classes. In this
regard, Dean Turner emphasized the
fact that teachers favored 60 minute
classes, particularly when giving tests.
Overall, the system has proven its
optimal efficiency by being accept-
able to both students and faculty
members. Elimination of Saturday
classes, the uniformity of class meet-
ings and the increased flexibility avail-
able for students in scheduling classes
has benifited the entire community
of Lynchburg College.

that if his answers to these problems
were publicly known, it would hurt
his chances of becoming president.
Hubert Humphrey has not minced any
words about his solutions to these
problems, and if they are ignored,
it will be a sad time for this country
and its people.

As for specific predictions about
the outcome of the elections, it must
be sai dthat the Humphrey-Muskie
ticket still has a fighting chance to
win. Their winning is not dependent
on snatching Republican votes from
Nixon or solid-south votes from Wal-
lace. It is dependent on the vote of
every loyal Democrat, They must woo
from the comfortable living rooms
and the favorite fishing hole the
people would vote the Democratic
Ticket, if they vote at all,

Some mention must be made here
of the choice of Vice-Presidential
candidates, because, as we all have
been painfully aware since 1963, the
chances of a vice-president ascending
to the presidency, are quite real. Only
Hubert Humphrey has sought to offer
to the American people a distinguish-
ed and able public servant as a vice-
presidential candidate, Edmund
Muskie has had a long and notable
career in the Senate and as Governor
of Maine. He has arisen in this cam-
paign as a true American statesman.

Nixon’s choice has had a political
career that defies all rational ex-
planation. From the mangership of
Shriber's Meat Market in Baltimore
to the governorship of Maryland in
Annapolis, Spiro Agnew has risen
only by default of the opposing forces.
His experience in state-level politics
is based on a partial term as gov-
ernor. His experience on the national
level is non-existant. Could the citi-

An extensive critique of George
Wallace’s running mate could not be
attempted here, for it would take
entirely too many agate lines, and
would most likely result in the burn-

one could imagine Curtis Le May as

Congress if elected, his lack of any
party loyalty would make him an
impotent President.

Therefore the only candidate who
will have any ability to deal with
Congress is Richard M. Nixon.
Whether you admire the policies of
Humphrey or worship the programs
of Wallace, they will probably re-
main campaign oratory even if elected.

Mr. Nixon seems certain of a tre-
mendous victory. The latest Gallup,
Time, and Associated Press polls in-
dicate a virtual landslide for Nixon
and humiliation for Humphrey. Even
Lou Harris, the Democrat poll-master
of 1960, concedes Nixon is the fa-
vorite.

The Wallace platform is appealing
to the average American who has
watched his country deteriorate dur-
ing the past years. These Americans
feel it is time for common sense in
government's highest level. They iden-
tify with Governor Wallace. He is
a man of the people.

The most surprising thing about
the Wallace movement is the nation-
wide momentum and enthusiasm it is
building. Support has sky-rocketed.
Because of this, it is now entirely
possible that George C, Wallace will
be elected President.

Many people doubt this can hap-

pen. | would ask them to consider
the following simple but possible
blue-print for his victory. Wallace

could fairly easily carry the entire
South and Border States. This would
give him 176 electorial votes. Also,
Governor Wallace could carry several
Northern, Eastern and Western
States. Included in this group might
be Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan,
Arizona, Illinois, Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania, California and others.
These states would give him the one
hundred additional electorial votes
needed and he would be elected.
Some people find it difficult to vis-
ualize Governor Wallace winning

sylvania and California. What one
must remember is that Humphrey
and Nixon are likely to run very
close to each other in these states,
Thus, Governor Wallace could carry
a state with 35 percent to 40 percent
of the vote. If one thinks Wallace is
incapable of amassing such percent-
ages outside the South, perhaps it
would be wise to review Wallace’s
vote in the Northern primaries he
entered in 1964. During that year,
when Liberalism was at its peak and
President Johnson was considered un-
beatable, Governor Wallace took up
to 45 percent of the vote.

The election is still two weeks away
and anything can happen. However,
if his movement continues to grow
between now and November 5, I
think that Governor George Wallace
will be the next President of the
United States. If he is, November 5
will be one of the greatest days in
American history!

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, OCTOBER 29, 1968

Number 12

 

   

By PETE HENDRICKS
Executive Committee Member

In the Tuesday, October 22 edition
of the Ring-tum Phi there appeared
a letter to the editor by Leslie Smith
criticizing the recent stand taken by
the Executive Committee on a pro-
posal made by Steve Sandler con-
cerning EC adoption of a statement
similar to the one sanctioned by the
IFC on the matter of housing dis-
crimination in the Lexington com-
munity with regard to girls from
neighboring schools, Having been
quite vocal in my Opposition to this
proposal, | would like to express my
reasons for having opposed its pas-
sage in the hopes that Mr, Smith
and others will be able to glean a
more lucid view of the issue in its
composite form.

I would like to premise my sub-
sequent statements upon the factual
backdrop which was presented to the
EC at the time of the proposal as to
the efforts which had already been
spent by the IFC in dealing with the
problem. The EC was told that a
substantial majority of the hostesses
in Lexington which do keep girls for
students on weekends had been ques-
tioned as to their individual stand on
the matter. The information gathered
from these inquiries revealed that the
major portion of these hostesses in
Lexington would discriminate when
accepting girls into their homes for
any given weekend, However, it was
reported to the EC that a number
of hostesses would not so discrimi-
nate and that the IFC had compiled
a reference list available upon in-
quiry as to those hostesses not ex-
ercising discrimination.

Thus it is seen that Mr. Smith is
in blatant factual error when he
glibly states that the EC refused to
aid the IFC in compiling such a
list. At the time Steve Sandler's pro-
posal came before the EC, the list
referred to had already been realized
through the commendable efforts of
a few individuals. | would like to
here note that had the Executive
Committee been asked to initially help
in forming this list, | personally
would have encouraged EC involve-
ment. It is the state of contrast be-
tween the existence of a very real
problem in this area and what in
fact has been done to at least ease
if not hopefully solve the problem
which is crucial to an appreciation
of the stand taken by the EC on
the question at hand.

it was a fact realized by the EC
that a very real problem had existed
as to the discriminatory practices of
certain hostesses in Lexington with
regard to the lodging of students’
dates on weekends. Several of the
neighboring girls’ schools acted on
their own during the summer moni!
and contacted all these hostesses in
Lexington which they respectively
approved asking them directly if they
would discriminate in accepting girls
for lodging.

From these inquiries, lists were pre-
pared and made available to the stu-
dents of these schools indicating those
hostesses which would not accordingly
discriminate. Additionally, while at-
tending the fall VASG Conference at
Randolph-Macon Women's College
last week, I specifically brought to
the attention of all those member
girls’ schools the fact that a listing
could be obtained through the Wash-
ingion and Lee IFC indicating those

hostesses in Lexington not practicing | sibility of snow flurries or rain.

discrimination in the housing of girls
on weekends.

Having viewed the combined ef-
forts of the IFC and the women’s
colleges in the area, it appeared to
me that the initial problem had been
appropriately dealt with as evidenced
by the fact that information is now
available as to those hostesses in Lex-
ington that will not practice discrimi-
nation such that the unfortunate inci-
dent experienced by a member of
this student body, to which Mr. Smith
referred in his letter, will not be re-
peated in the future.

However, it is only to the point
of making such a listing available to
all those desiring it that | would en-
courage any sanctioning by the EC.
Our neighboring girls’ schools have
the privilege to drop any hostess
from their approved lists for reasons
of discrimination if they so desire.
Additionally, the individual student
at Washington and Lee can imple-
ment a boycott of those hostesses
which discriminate if he so chooses.
Thus, with the above considerations
having been made, in the final analy-
sis the paradoxical import of Steve
Sandler's proposal as lauded by Mr.
Smith needs to be examined.

Were the EC to have passed Steve
Sandler's proposal on this issue it
would itself have executed an action
extremely detrimental to the Univer-
sity community. The hostesses in Lex-
ington have individually determined
for themselves whether or not to
practice discrimination in their hous-
ing. By their actions, the individual
student as well as his date have the
prerogative to either patronize those
hostesses so discriminating or not to
patronize them. For the EC to have
passed a proposal asking that girls
only patronize those hostesses not ac-
cordingly discriminating would have
resulted in denying to the student his
own exercise of rationale concerning
the problem.

Without qualification, 1 feel that
the passage of such a proposal would
have seriously stifled that movement
within the individual student to de-
velop his own ability to form a basis
upon which to make moral judgments
which, if | am not greatly mistaken,
is one of the primary aims of the
liberal arts college such as Wash-
ingion and Lee.

in conclusion, | would like to stress
the point that while the pace for
change in the social conditions exist-
ing on this campus might not be as
quick as some would like for it to
be. there exists a genuine concern

 

for what needs to be done. The re-
sulting solutions which stem from
problems that arise, such as the one
under discussion, will be tempered
with reasoning earnestly striving for
the betterment of the University as)
a whole. I only sincerely hope that |
this University community will never
permit itself to remedy a problem
such that the cure is far more detri-
mental to its healthy grwoth than was |
the original ailment,

plan which is a half-semester limited
contact plan.

This motion was the formal direc-
tion of the IFC to President Clark
Carter for his presentation of the
IFC’s deferred rush plan next Mon-
day. It followed a presentation by
Danny Leonard of both the Hosford-
Stovall plan and the Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi plan.

In other action, the IFC was activ-
ely urged to support a blood drive
December 12, when the bloodmobile
will make its first appearance on the
W&L campus since 1963. W&L stu-
dents have been the lowest contribu-
tors of blood in the Lexington area
for many years. It is planned to award
a keg of beer to that fraternity which
has the largest percentage of its mem-
bership donate blood.

Dean Atwood noted that there had
been much trouble over the last week-
end with out-of-town students. He
said that many townspeople, mistake
these students for W&L students and
as such, do not help the image of
the W&L student with the Lexing-
ton townspeople. He asked that the
student body help him in finding out
who these people are and what school
they are from so that they may be
properly disciplined.

In the debate over the deferred
rush proposals, the major obstacles
in the Hosford-Stovall plan was the
lack of fraternity revenue during the
first semester while still supporting,
partially, the social life of the fresh-
man class.

Clark Carter reported that there
will be another meeting this Thursday
between the IFC spokesmen and the
faculty Executive Committee; the pur-
pose of the meeting will be to decide
whether the Executive Committee will
endorse the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
plan as the best for W&L or whether
it will allow the plan to go to the
faculty without endorsement. The

 

Tuesday Ring-tum Phi plan is not

Mid-semester rush
urged in IFC vote

within the bounds of the faculty
resolution in that it allows for pledg-
ing after mid-semester.

In other debate on deferred rush,
a motion was introduced, and then
dropped, urging the selection com-
mittee for dorm counselors work
under the guiding criterion of dis-
tributing the dorm counselors out
among the 18 fraternities. Dean At-
wood made it clear that this would
tend to decrease the level of the dorm
counselors if the University was re-
quired to select one member from
each fraternity. It was also noted
that any counselor who would be
obviously using his position to rush
would be replaced.

The IFC also passed a motion
which again outlawed formal sum-
mer rush publications. The minimum
gpr requirement for pledging was
lowered from 2.0 to 1.5 in that the
2.0 level would eliminate over 100
freshmen from eligibility.

University memorial
established in honor
of Lee McLaughlin

The establishment of a memorial
scholarship honoring former head
football coach Lee McLaughlin was
announced on October 26. President
Robert E. R. Huntley, who made
the announcement, stated, “There
could be no more fitting memorial to
Lee McLaughlin than one which as-
sists and honors outstanding young
men.”

The McLaughlin scholarship will
be awarded to a rising junior with
an above-average academic record
who embodies the qualities of char-
acter and dedication exemplified by
Coach McLaughlin and will be held
by this student during his junior and
senior years. Considerations for the
scholarship wil linclude the student's
success in extra-curricular activities,
his relations with his fellow man, his
devotion to Washington and Lee, and
his atributes of sportsmanship and

Nixon-Agnew win easy victory
in mock presidential election

By ROBERT H. YEVICH

The man who easily captured the
nomination of his party in the Mock
Convention six months ago, Richard
M. Nixon, continued his winning
streak on the W&L campus yesterday,
In The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi’s presi-
dential preferential poll, the Nixon-
Agnew slate smoothly rode to vic-

In yesterday's balloting the Republi-

can candidates received more than
double the number of votes of the
second place runners, Hubert H.
Humphrey and Edmund Muskie.

In analyzing the results of the bal-
loting, Nixon’s sweep of 59.7 per cent
of the total vote stands as an un-
questionable majority. Breaking down
the results according to classes,
Nixon maintained a majority in the
law school and in each of the under-
graduate classes with the exception
of the senior class. The successful

A somewhat diminishing appetite for VASG

By JAY PASSAVANT
Student Body President

On October 22, Tuesday of last
week, five members of the Washing-
ton and Lee student body attended a
fall conference sponsored by the Vir-
ginia Association of Student Govern-
ments. The all-day conference was
held at Randolph-Macon Women’s
College and was the first major meet-
ing of the VASG this year. The five
members of the student body repre-
senting W&L were Rob Bauer and
Pete Hendricks of the Executive Com-
mittee, Reed Byrum of the Tuesday
Ring-tum Phi, Dave Stovall, social
chairman of the IFC, and myself.

A one word description of the
day's proceedings would be simple—

waste. After a luncheon and a 35-
minute speech by Mills Godwin, gov-
ernor of Virginia, which turned out to
be a promotional effort for the 81-
million-dollar bond issue, the dele-
gates broke into sub-committee to
discuss various topics of interest. The
report of each one of our delegates
was the same—a definite lack of
organization and a lack of anything
useful coming out of the meeting.
Without exception, each delegate felt
his time would have been better spent
at WAL.

Perhaps the worst disaster of the
day was averted when member col-
leges voted 10-9 against a proposal
that would have given public sup-
port of the Governor's Bond Issue.

(Continued on Page 4)

 

Republican showed his greatest
strength in the freshman class polling
two out of every three freshman
votes for 211 of 325 votes cast.

Among the faculty Nixon did not
fare so well. In faculty balloting the
Humphrey-Muskie ticket claimed 24
of 42 votes for 57 per cent of those
voting. Nixon received support from
16 faculty members (38 per cent of
those voting), with the remaining two
faculty votes going to George Wallace
and to a write-in candidate.

Judging from the results of this
preferential poll, the roots of Nixon’s
support in the student body are im-
beded deep in the freshman class
where he wielded a 4-1 edge over
Humphrey. This poll also indicated a
decreasing amount of pro-Nixon sup-
port with each step up the academic
ladder.

Nixon's poorest backing among the
students showed up in senior class
balloting: he fell just short of winning
a majority. The law school displayed
rejuvenated sentiment on behalf of
Nixon, who won 58 per cent of the
law school ballots.

Independent Party candidate
George Wallace expectedly made a
poor showing taking only 6.6 per cent
of the ballots. Wallace's supporters
seemed evenly spaced throughout the
student body on a 1 to 14 ratio.

The 8.6 per cent who voted for
write-in candidates displayed a wide
variety of opinion. McCarthy led the
write-ins with 21, followed not too
far behind by the menacing Pat
Paulsen with 15. Dick Gregory and
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller captured 13
and 7 write-in votes respectfully.

The remaining 24 write-ins were
scattered among eleven candidates
ranging from President Johnson to
Edward Kennedy, from William Buck-
ley to Eldridge Cleaver, and from
Gen. Westmoreland to Gov. Reagan.

By REED BYRUM
Managing Editor

W&L must re-evaluate its member-
ship in VASG, as the old criticisms
that came to a head last Spring have
once again been reclaimed, but now
more justifiably and rightfully than
ever.

Admittedly, this is a young organi-
zation, one with excellent ideals and
potential; but also one that has gained
the approval of most private and pub-
lic colleges throughout Virginia. With
this acceptance it claims almost awe-
striking power in its youth and it is
boldly asserting with youthful ex-
uberance its new found power, much
to the possible discredit and the real-

 

istic disapproval of its participants.

Alumni Association head

Who is he? William C. Washburn,
Executive Secretary of Washington
and Lee University Alumni, Incorpo-
rated. What does he do? He over-
sees the operations of the Alumni
Association. Why do so few people
see him? He's usually visiting some of
the forty-eight active alumni chapters
in the country.

Mr. Washburn’s schedule for the

next month is quite rigorous. He

Little do people realize the amount
of work concerned with the admini-

The association publishes the Alumni

country. If is also concerned with
fund drive,
which includes around 100 class
agents and 150 regional agents, and
Homecoming Weekend and the class
reunions, The association was respon-
sible for the special program con-
ducted last year in which returning
members from the various alumni
chapters were given an intensive three-
day training program concerning the
purpose of the University and the
direction in which it is headed.

Relations with the alumni are im-
portant, according to Mr. Washburn.
lt is through the alumni that the de-
velopment of the University continues.
The New Science building was built
through organized alumni campaigns.
Also important is the interest that the
alumni chapters instill in prospective
freshman from their area by introduc-
ing WAL to high school students and
in helping them with admission.

 

LETTERS TO THE

Henberg takes exception
with Tuesday editorial

EDITOR

aw

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

I am writing in response to an
editorial in last Tuesday’s Ring-tum
Phi which cited the lack of student
influence in decisions by the faculty
and administration. I admit to a
similar distress in many instances,
particularly where student academic
standards and requirements are con-
cerned. Under current circumstances
there are many times I feel domi-
nated by an impersonal voice boom-
ing, “You shall do this for the sake
of doing it.”

Therefore | support programs aim-
ed at better allowing student opinion
to be felt and expressed. For instance
I share the belief that students should
be allowed to sit on both the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the Faculty and
the Committee on Courses and De-
grees. To the point, however, it is
not with the spirit of Mr. Honig’s
editorial I take exception; I object
rather to his choice of the Student
Curriculum Committee as a concrete
example.

On a factual level, everything said
in the editorial is true. The commit-
tee has no actual power other than
in the form of recommendations to
the faculty Curriculum Committee.
In essence, however, even the faculty
committee has no power other than
recommendation to the faculty as a
whole.

It was called to my attention that
last Tuesday's editorial has been con-

Lynchburg plan fails

to solve current flaws

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

Recently the faculty took the first
step toward a five day week. In a
special meeting it voted to consider
the implementation of the so-called
Lynchburg plan.

The Lynchburg plan offered the
plan of least resistance. It entails no
block scheduling changes and margi-
nal adjustments in actual class meet-
ing times.

Its simplicity, however, is all the
Lynchburg plan possesses to recom-
mend it. There has been little attempt
to take this opportunity to examine
the whole of the present class schedul-
ing plan in terms of general academic
life.

There is a major flaw in the cur-
rent system which will be perpetuated
and probably worsened. That is that
fifty percent of the upper level-single-
meeting block courses, over one hun-
dred in number, are scheduled in
three blocks E, F, and G. The Lynch-
burg plan will make the “undesir-
able” early morning hours earlier
and late morning hours later there-
by making the “desirable” middle
hours more so.

For any new courses, a small num-
ber of course offerings are inherent

The Tuesday

Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper
Tuesday, October 29, 1968

The Dance Board has not abandoned hope, though,

~~Disallow the transference of dance plans. All that

Saturday classes

No matter what the final disposition of a five-day week
may be, we as students can take pride in the fact that a plan
supported by us has been favorably received by the faculty.
The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi plan is not the best alternative
to a six-day week—more sweeping changes in the schedule
are certain to be considered in the future. But for the time
being, the Tuesday plan seems to have less criticism than
any other before the faculty and could provide (as soon as
next semester) a pleasant and delightful change in the cur-
riculum,

The Dance Board

For all its circumlocutions in recent days, the Dance
Board has yet to formulate any policy designed to increase
its income substantially—an achievement which, as the
Board well knows, needs to be accomplished. The Dance
Board is not in an ideal situation, however, to remedy the
situation. It faces what has become a dilemma almost with-
out solution, as students want the big names in current en-
tertainment, but names for whom the asking price escalates
exponentially, ;

We remember two years ago, when the fare for the four
big weekends included the Four Tops, the Temptations,
Dionne Warwick, Chuck Jackson, Sam and Dave, Chuck
Berry, the Tams, and Peter Duchin. Such a lineup this year
would cost about twice as much as the Board’s total budget,
exclusive of decorations and back-up groups. It may well
be that big entertainment at Washington and Lee will be-
come limited to one or two weekends a year. We're already
down to one night's worth of concert per dance set, instead
of the customary two,

despite the dearth of possible remedies. Each year the Uni-
versity is asked to integrate fees for parties into tuition col-
lection—a request which is turned down, with good cause.
Prices of dance plan cards have been raised, necessarily,
but the trend cannot be continued for very long. This year,
the Board sought to coerce increased dance plan purchases
by stipulating the plans were non-transferable, which stipula-
tion was unwisely removed the day before the Openings
concert.

What, then, can the Dance Board do to continue for as
long as possible to bring showmen to W&L? We offer
some suggestions, made in consideration of the Board's
position and with the best interests of the student body in
mind:

—Abolish Finals weekend. This concert series is attend-
ed by about one-fourth of the students, and is given at a
time when the desire to stay for the concert is too often
outweighed by inconvenience and a desire to go home after
examinations,

—End “University” cocktail parties as we now know
them, substituting a less expensive mode of entertainment.
These parties, where poor drinks are usually served, are
financed by class dues, which money could be routed to the
Dance Board. Then the Board could furnish a combo for
the parties, leaving liquor consumption up to the discretion
and the budgets of the students.

Allow the sale of dance plans at any point in the year,
for a pro-rated share of cost plus 20 per cent after Openings
and 30 per cent after Fancy Dress (an incentive to buy
early).

Allow admission sales of guest tickets at the door to non-
students.

Allow students to be admitted to concerts, at the
door, for the price of a guest ticket plus 30 per cent.

need be done (and it has not yet been done, to our knowl-
edge) to insure that each W&L student has properly gained
admittance is to ask, at the door, “Are you a W&L student?”
If so, “Is this your dance plan?” or “May I check which
type of ticket you have?” In this way, the Dance Board has
1) encouraged the early purchase of dance plans (presum-
ably, the summer-purchase discount would be continued) ;
2) allowed for those who decide to attend at the last minute;
3) made provisions for those students who cannot afford a
dance plan early in the year; 4) made it possible to attend
only one or two concerts (though the cost to the student
would be greater); and 5) encouraged attendance by non-
W&L students (from the University of Virginia and else-
where) by allowing at-the-door admission sales.

The Dance Board may legitimately object that some of
these suggestions inhibit its ability to pre-collect for the
budget. The Board should, however, be able to forecast
adequately how many will attend each series. The limitations
here are not severe. Some objections may be voiced by the
student body; but a choice must be made. In future years,
our unnecessary expenditures for cocktail parties and the
unjustified continuance of Finals will relegate big weekends
at W&L to little more than shadows of the gaiety and excite-
ment they once were,

Beaters duadinched by Héliies in
final pertod on disputed penalty

Poor teamwork led to a 2-2 double
overtime tie for the W&L soccer
team, against VPI on Friday. AIl-
though the Generals didn’t play well,
they did outplay the Hokies who man-
aged the stalemate through poor
officiating.

The Blue got off to a good start
in the first half. Fred Fletcher scored
the first goal for the home team in
the first quarter, and Jack Horowitz
added another in the second quarter.
But the Gobblers managed to get back
one of the goals toward the end of
the half.

Virginia Tech tied things up in the
final quarter on a disputed call. A
penalty shot was called against Don
Belt for tripping inside the goal

 

 

crease. Not only was the call a doubt-
ful one, but the penalty imposed was
incorrect. For such an offense, VPI
should either have been awarded an
indirect shot from inside the crease,
or a direct one from the outside.
Instead the Hokies were given a direct
shot from inside the crease, and a
score followed.

The game had to be dishearten-
ing for the Generals. Despite several
periods of fine play, they continu-
ally turned into individuals playing a
team game. Too many long kicks
were made instead of working the
ball up to the linemen. The backs
played poorer than usually, with the
fullbacks experiencing their worst
game of the season.

What is the Bethlehem Loop Course? It is our management development program for graduates

The course starts early in July with four weeks of orientation at our home offices in Bethlehem,

Pa. Loopers attend lectures on every phase of the corporation's activities, and make almost daily

visits to a steel plant.

Steel Plant Loopers, who comprise a majority of the average loop class of 150 to 200 graduates,
proceed to various plants where they go through a brief orientation program before beginning
their on-the-job training assignments, Within a short time after joining the course, most loopers
are ready for assignments aimed toward higher levels of management.

How about other loopers? Our Sales Department loopers (30 or so) remain at the home office for

Deferred Rush

The Faculty Executive Committee
yesterday recommended that the fac-
ulty as a whole in its meeting Mon-
day approved on a three-year trial
basis a deferred rush plan calling for
the end of rush and pledging just
before Thansgiving.

The plan, presented to the com-
mittee by Student Body Vice-Presi-
dent Danny Leonard, was drafted by
Mike Hosford and Dave Stovall, was |
presented to the Interfraternity Coun-
cil Monday, October 21, and appear-
ed in Ring-tum Phi the next day.

 

It calls for a series of open houses, |
in which the freshmen may visit the |
houses in the evening after the start |
of classes, Although rush would form-
ally end near mid-semester, no pledg- |
ing activities could be scheduled un- |

til after the start of the second
semester.
The plan as originally presented

to the IFC called for rush ending at |
the beginning of the second semester,
but it was offered to the faculty in
its present form folowing a Tuesday |
Ring-tum Phi editorial asking for mid- |
semester deferred rush.

According to Dean William J.
Walt, neither this plan, nor another
one to be considered by the faculty

Monday, incorporate “no contact”
rules.
The other plan to be considered

is one which calls for a semester-long
rush, the method of open houses or
“smokers” to be employed in_ this
case also.

The action of the Faculty Executive

Committee followed a similar en-
dorsement by the Student Affairs
Committee, another faculty group,

and repeated actions by the IFC de-
siring a reconsideration of the resolu-
tion passed last year which called
for rush after the first semester of
the freshman year.

Since freshmen would be allowed
social use of the fraternities for
combo weekends during the rush
period, the plan also incorporates a
social fee in addition to the rush

fee each rushee now pays.

 

PLAYING A SCENE from the current Troub production, lonesco’s “Exit the King,” are Mrs. Betty Kahn, wife of
the Troubs’ director, and Pat Bernarezyk, a freshman at W&L. The play will run tonight and tomorrow night, with

curtain both times at 8:30 p.m.

Toward Better Concerts

Although it is not our intention at this time to criticize
the operations of the Dance Board, we feel there are certain
things this group could have done and can do in the future
to make concerts more enjoyable.

Last weekend’s ““$100-a-minute” concert featuring the Four
Tops certainly was not worth the money paid to have this
big-name group. Unless one happened to be sitting on the
sides of the stage, he could not hear anything over the loud
speakers. Those sitting in the center aisles could only see
mouths moving but could not be sure voices were being
emitted. Even when voices were heard, they were garbled and
scratchy.

This is no new problem. For every event held in Doremus
Gymnasium there is something wrong with the sound equip-
ment. There is no reason to spend so much money on a group
when they cannot be heard clearly. We might just as well play
their records if we do not rent or buy new sound equipment.

One thing that irks us to no end is the spotlight. The per-
son who works the spotlight feels as if the light must keep
time with the music. He keeps changing the colors of the light
so that sometimes the stage is completely dark. This is dis-
tracting to the audience as well as to the performers.

Whenever there is a big-name group playing at a W&L
concert, we feel the Dance Board should try to have it in a
larger place than Doremus Gym. For example, the VMI field-
house might be used. This would allow more people without
dance plans to come to the concerts and help defray some of
the expenses.

We ask the Dance Board to keep these suggestions in mind.
The equipment and atmosphere must keep in step with the
rising quality of entertainment W&L demands.

Verbal Convictions

(Reprinted from Hollins Columns, October 8, 1968)

Last spring, Hollins students were outraged over discti-
minatory practices of approved hostesses in Charlottesville,
Blacksburg, Lexington and Natural Bridge. We protested,
abhorring injustice and prejudice. The ruling was changed,
allowing a wider choice of accomodations.

Yet the position of the hostesses remains unchallenged. Too
many Hollins students continue to patronize those hostesses
who specify “no colored.” The forms on file in the Student
Activities office show clearly which houses are not open to all
Hollins students. To choose to stay in one of these homes is
hypocrisy.

It is time to carefully consider the strength of our verbal
convictions.

Acknowledgement Of Source

We regret that we failed to acknowledge the source of
last week’s lead editorial entitled, “Choose A Candidate—If
You Can.” The editorial was reprinted in a shortened and
substantially unchanged form from the editorial, titled

“Choose If You Can,” of the October 19, 1968 issue of The
New Republic.

This is not our usual practice and certainly was not done
consciously. We do not condone this and shall strive to be
more careful in the future.

CONTACT To Study ‘Power’

By PAT AREY

CONTACT for 1969 will center
around the faces of power, accord-
ing to Chairman Sam Hinkle. This
year’s CONTACT subject will be
“power, its uses and abuses, implica-
tions and attainment,” said Hinkle.

CONTACT is an intellectual and
public affairs symposium sponsored
by the Interfraternity Council and stu-
dent body. This year it will be held
the second week in February.

Speakers have been invited to talk
on black power, student power,
foreign policy and the American in-
volvement abroad. Other topics will
include the power of many over his
environment and its philospohical im-
plications, and the role of the artist/
intellectual within the power complex,

CONTACT was first initiated in
the spring of 1965 under the auspices
of the IFC. The topic was “The
American Experience and Its Impli-
cations.” Speakers included New York
Times Washington Bureau chief Tom
Wicker and presidential assistant
Douglass Cater. Cater is the author
of a book on the influence of news
reporting on the conduct of govern-
ment affairs, The Fourth Branch of
Government.

The CONTACT Program for 1966
centered on the problem of the
American city. Author and social
critic Michael Harrington was one of
the major speakers. He is the author
of “The Other America” and “The
Accidental Century.”

Following Harrington, CONTACT
featured conservative columnist and
urbanologists Ernst Van Den Haag
and Claude Brown, author of “Man-
child in the Promised Land,” a book
on Brown's experiences as a child in
the ghettos of New York.

Most Popular Speaker

One of the most popular speakers

| CONTACT

sponsorship was Tom
Wolfe. Wolfe, a WAL graduate, is
the author of “The Kandy Kolored
Tangerine Flake Streamlined Baby”
and more recently two works, one en-
titled “The Pump House Gang.”
The 1967 CONTACT topic was
“The Crumbling Establishment.” It
featured former CORE director James

Conservative spokesman Frederick
Wilhelmsen gave his view on_ the
American “establishment.”

CONTACT 1968 centered around
the upcoming W&L Mock Republican
Convention. The topic was “What's
New Pachyderm?”

The first speaker was Kentucky
Senator Thurston Morton. Morton
spoke on the policies of the Republi-
can party.

Barry Goldwater was the major
speaker of the program. He spoke
to a capacity crowd in Evans Dining
Hall on Friday night. Goldwater was
the Republican candidate for Presi-
dent in 1964, and is currently run-
ning for the U. S. Senate in Arizona.

Other speakers include former
Presidential assistant Stephen Hess.
Hess was co-author of “The Republi-

 

 

can Establishment” along with Wash-
ington Post political reporter David
Broader,

The program was rounded out with
former Maryland Governor Theodore
McKeldin, who nominated Dwight
Eisenhower at the 1952 Republican
National Convention; political
columnist Robert Novak and pollster
Samuel Lubell.

The 1969 CONTACT Steering
Committee was selected last spring.
Named chairman was Sam Hinkle, a
senior from Shelbyville, Ky. The vice-
chairman is Mike Nation, a senior
from Knightstown, Ind. Other mem-
bers are Mark Faverman, Ned Powell,
Ken Long, Jeff Wexler, Dave Field,
Danny Leonard, Dave Hardee,
Michael “Thunder” Thornton, and
Patrick Arey.

 

 

 

The Youngest Delegate

By FRANK ROSE

A large part of the enraptured read- |
ers of the latest issue of The South-
ern Conservative were doubtless sur-
prised to find that the lead article |
was a feature about the participation |
in the 1968 Democratic National Con- |
vention of a freshman at Washington |
and Lee.

That freshman was Steve Dugan of |
Fort Valley, Georgia. The article, |
written by Dugan himself, describes |
his experiences as a voting delegate
on the Georgia delegation at Chicago
this past August.

One of the more interesting parts
of Dugan's story was that in which |
he said, “I had been thrust into an
influential position. I represented over |
60,000 Georgians.”

In a private interview earlier this |

year old Miss Degermark, in her first
film, is a beautifully human (rather
than innocent or naive) Elvira, while
veteran Berggren is more fatalistic
in his best performance to date. The
rich faces of the minor characters,
and indeer the exquisite natural colors
of Scandinavia, are so wonderfully
captured by the photography that it
would seem that Degas has been ani-
mated,

The most frequent, though super
ficial, criticism of Elvira Madigan is
that in attempting to be artful it
violates the rigid formula that must
be followed if a picture is to be a

success; that this film is

 

simply a series of exquisitely compos
ed shots spliced together in an order
that imitates the structure of a plot
Such 4 criticism assumes an idyllic
style and pace, and might even de
termine Elvira and Sixten to be stupid

Hendricks Stand Attacked

Dear Editor:

In Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi, Pete
Hendricks rationalized away the prin-
ciple of human dignity for Black
people by arguing that we do not
need to apply it to the issue of hous-
ing Black dates in Lexington.

Thus, his article concerning the EC
policy is a statement of white racism,

A Look At Spiro

Dear Sirs:

Tuesday night I traveled to Staun-
ton with a group of Washington and
Lee Young Republicans to hear Re-
publican Vice-Presidential candidate
Spiro T. Agnew speak. I am a liberal

but I was interested in what Mr,
Agnew had to say.
Admittedly Mr. Agnew’s speech

was, in the first place, political. He
played to his audience in quest of
their support (which he probably al-
ready had anyway). Even so one could
detect his feeling on the issues and
his candidacy from his speech.

The most vivid impression I got
from his remarks was his constant
reference to what he termed the
“quiet Americans.” This is the large
number of middle-class Americans
whom Agnew and Nixon feel are the
victims of today’s domestic and
foreign problems. He and Nixon have
made it clear that they plan to, and
expect to receive the overwhelming
majority of the middle-class vote. At
this point in the campaign _ this
strategy is proving very successful.
As | looked around the audience
on Tuesday night what | saw were
mostly middle-class whites. | didn’t
see any but I was told that there
were only five Negroes in an audience
that must have numbered at least
three thousand, This indicates to me
something about the campaign of
Nixon and Agnew. They are ignor-
ing the black man, the poor man,
and the young person in their quest
for the highest offices in the land.
How they expect to govern effectively
without the support of these three
vital segments of the society is be-
yond me,

Agnew also addressed himself to
the talk of balancing the budget. This
he said would be one of the objectives

A Statement Of Policy

By KR. BRANDON WILDES

|

Some weeks ago I released my first |
“biting satire” (thanks Erome!), pri- —

marily directed at the present Phys|
Fd program, which produced the re-|
sults that I had been hoping for. |
They came in the form of a biting

day Phi, while rebuking everything 1)

didn't make much sense to me either |
One thing they might have done was
to defend the coaching staff, (Per-
sonally | think they're a darn fine
group of guys, just misdirected.) How-

ever
I think that a statement of pur
pose amd policy is indicated, Wash

ingion and Lee is not living up to its
full potential. The fact remains, and
regatdiess of what it may be at
tributed to, that we are losing 15
points on median college board scores
annually, (1 suppose | should now
expect a letter from Dean Farrar)
Perhaps the population ix decreasing,
however, there still intelligent
students somewhere, and we are not
attracting them. Fifteen poinis would

ourselves in the myth that our school

with some misfounded idea of wait:

around to that in the future.)

Menu For Tomorrow’s Game--Tiger Meat

 

Baby Generals
Kick AMA, 39-0

Although Bridgewater became the
first victims of the varsity footbal
team last Saturday, it was not the
first victory by a football team this
year, For the day before, the fresh-
man football team encountering
August Military Academy were able
to claim that distinction, And _ their
victory was a very convincing 39-0
thrashing of A.M.A,

What made the game so much
more astounding was that the baby
Generals were using an offense in-
stalled only two days before—the
single wing. The key to a good single
wing attack is the tailback, and Jo-Jo
Martin proved that to A.M.A. Jo-Jo
moved the baby Generals at will and,
except for some dropped passes and
mistakes near A.M.A.’s goal line,
the score could have been even
greater. In moving the baby Gen-
erals, Jo-Jo managed to find time
to throw a touchdown pass while scor-
ing three times himself,

he first period was scoreless, but

| in the second period W&L broke the
| game
|came with 8:41 left in the half on a

wide open. ‘The first score
Martin pass to Dan Armstrong from
38 yards out. Martin kicked the
extra point. Then Bobby LaRue re-
covered an A.M.A. fumble on their
four yard line and Martin scored
from the two with 7:47 left in the
half. The kick failed. Then with 3:58
remaining in the half Martin scored
from the 15 yard line but the kick
again was no good. This touchdown
had been set up by Glenn Torger-
son's 25 yard punt return to the
A.M.A. 25 and then an interference
penalty against A.M.A, at the fifteen.

Seventeen second later, Dave Har-
bert picked off an A.M.A. pass and
returned it 42 yards for a_touch-
down to make the score 25-0. With
just 57 seconds left in the half, Torg-
erson scored the baby Generals’ fifth
touchdown of the quarter on a two-
yard run, This had been set up by a
Martin to Armstrong pass good for
30 yards to the 2. The score at the
half was 31-0.

The second half scored only one
touchdown, that on a 32 yard run
by Martin with 3:55 left in the game.
Duncan Pace caught a two point con-
version pass to end the scoring for
the day with WAL winning 39-0.

Certainly the bady Generals look-
ed impressive both offensively and
defensively last Friday and they will
have a chance to end their season
at the .S00 level by beating Green-
briar Military Academy next Friday.
That may be a large task, however,
as Greenbriar pasted the same A.M.A.
team 77-0. In any case it looks to be
a high-scoring battle.

Hunting Season To Begin

The general hunting season for
turkeys and small game opens in
Rockbridge County Monday and indi-
cations point to a fairly plentiful
supply of game.

The bear hunters will be able to

itake to the woods a week later, on
i

 

Nov. 11, and the two-week deer sea-
ison opens a week after that, on
Nov. 18.

The only big change in the hunt-
ing regulations for Rockbridge this
year is the change of the hunters’
choice day, when bucks or does can
be shot, from the first day of the
season to the last day. This will
apply in counties west of the Blue

Ridge, according to counly game
warden Don Wirt.
One area which is popular with

local hunters, the Gathright Wildlife
Management Area in Bath and Al
jleghany counties, will not be open
for fall turkey hunting this year.

The small game and squirrel sea
son will be open here from Nov, 4

through Jan. 31: the turkey season
from Nov, 4 to Dec. 17; the bear
season from Nov. 11 to Dec. 21

and the deer season from Nov, 18

to Nov. 30.

it ‘‘a real juicer.’

Interpretation: the Generals won’t have any trouble getting
“juiced up” for Saturday’s home game with their chief rivals,

Sewanee’s Purple Tigers.

A definite rivalry has developed between the two schools.
“Each tries to be superior academically and in athletics too,”

Wolf said. “Playing Sewanee is an*—-——

automatic incentive.”

It’s a rivalry the coaches have en-
couraged. “Sewanee has had such
outstanding teams, we've sold our
kids on the challenge of beating
them,” said W&L head coach Buck
Leslie. “But the boys have largely
done it themselves.”

“It's the type of football they play,”
added Wolf. “It’s real ‘come at you’
football.”

2:30 p.m. tomorrow on Wilson Field.
It’s Parents’ Weekend at W&L, and
1,200 visiting parents and guests will
be among those on hand.

The game is also an important
conference contest. Both Washington
and Lee (0-1 in the league) and
Sewanee (1-1) have long-shot chance
of tieing front-runner Centre (3-1)
for the College Athletic Conference
championship. Centre has completed
its conference schedule.

Sewanee’s single-wing offense will
pose some problems for the Generals,
It features a pair of hard-running
tailbacks, Jim Beene and Bill Blount,
and fullback Nathaniel (Bubba)
Owens, whom the Generals remember
well from last year when he gained
144 yards in a 43-0 Sewanee rout.

WAL will counter with its offense
centered around scrambling quarter-
back Chuck Kuhn. The Louisville,

Ky. junior accounted for 130 yards, |

scored one touchdown and threw for
two more as W&L won its first game
last Saturday, 27-13, over Bridge-
water.

Scatback Joe Dozier gained 64
yards against Bridgewater and is now

of a Nixon Administration, Nixon
and Agnew are also “hawks” and
would be sure to continue to sup-
port our position in Vietnam. It will
be a miracle if the Nixon administra-
tion could balance a budget that re-
quires the cost of a war and the
cost of tremendous domestic needs.
Mr. Agnew claimed that domestic
needs could be statisfied “fueling the
powerful engines of free enterprise,”
yet he neglected to mention the money
that it would cost, Also it is entirely
questionable whether or not free)
enterprise (the quasi-god of the Re-
publican party) could be trusted, In
my own home town free enterprise
has ruined the investments of count-
less homeowners through corrupt
zoning practices. Who’s to say that
free enterprise would not look for
every opportunity to build their bank
accounts at the exepnse of the gov-
Free en-
terprise has the money but not the
integrity to handle the elimination of |
the ghetto.

Mr. Agnew also addressed himself |
to the question of academic freedom. |
He stated that someone like Eldridge
Cleaver should not be allowed to!
lecture in an American university (as
he did at Berkley). When one starts |
to delude himself that academic free-
dom is the exclusion of the likes of |
Eldridge Cleaver he is clearly wrong. |
Academic freedom is a matter of in-|
clusion not exclusion, where everyone |
who should be heard is heard. When
everyone is heard then each will |
make his decision accordingly, with
the understanding of all points of
view. This is academic freedom.

In quoting the president of the
American Bar association Mr. Agnew

 

 

 

 

 

 

said he agreed with the statement

that “riots are a negetion of justice.”
One gathered from his statements that
he felt this is the only cause of riots.
If he does, he certainly does not de-
serve to be vice-president. A negation
of justice may be the initial spark to
a riot but the true causes lie in the
deplorable conditions in the ghetto.
One should attack the cause of a
riot, the horrible conditions in the
ghetto, not the result—lawlessness, if
riots are to be eliminated. Again
Mr. Agnew fails to grasp an issue
as it exists in America today.

Who then should one vote for
Nixon is definitely out of the picture
because he and Agnew agree on the
above mentioned issues, and in my
opinion they are both misdirecting
their remedies for America’s prob-
lems, while disregarding the poor
and the black. Unhappily after listen-
ing to Spiro T. Agnew speak Tuesday
night | have come to the conclusion
that the only logical choice for Presi-
dent and Vice-President is Hubert
Humphrey and Edmond Muskie.
Neither are very attractive candidates
but four years of complete disregard

‘Elvira,’ A Filmed Dream

(Continued from Page 2)
What the film’s detractors fail to
realize is the Elvira Madigan is
penetrating a new realm: one reviewer
described it as “an exploration of
state of being and feeling’; | choose
to call it a filmed dream.

It is to Widenberg’s credit that, in
creating this dream state, he exercises
remarkable restraint in sustaining the
action; rather than impress us with an
ingenious display of flashbacks or at-
tempt to keep our interest by insert-
ing several semi-climactic bedroom
scenes (which recently have become
all but obligatory in the “adult”
movie), he skillfully blends visual and
aural elements into a rhythmic style
that encourages the spectator to cast
off his consciousness of watching a
movie. For this reason much of the
film is silent in style; all is not re-
vealed, we must piece together the
psychology of the lovers in our own
minds,

Having established the “level of
reality” in which he wishes to operate,
Widerberg slowly tightens the action;
each suceeding scene seems to be
more heavly melancholic in anticipa-
tion of the lover's inevitable doom.
Suspense is generated when the plot
fades into reality just as we are
getting accustomed to the dream
world. When the bubble bursts there
is only a feeling of mild bursts there
tragic moment, however, is imbedded
in the mind, to be recalled shortly
afterwards.

The Youngest Delegate

(Continued from Page 2)

it became increasingly evident that
the Maddox delegation would be un-
seated in favor of the one led by
state Representative Julian Bond.
Dugan reports that when the regular |
delegation walked out rather than
share its votes with the one led by
Bond, “We felt like the Democratic
Party had left Georgia.” As he re-
flects in the Southern Conservative,
“Paced with the choice between being
a Democrat and being a self-respect-
ing individual, I chose the latter.”

Questioned By Nation

(Continued from Page 2)

the plan which need to be considered.

The most obvious effect of the
Lynchburg plan is that it demands
less time be spent on campus. Is this
desirable on a campus where the aca-
demic-social dichotomy is of such a
strained nature that the faculty has
requested the fraternities to delay rush
so that a freshman may be academic-
ally oriented at the outset rather than
socliarly? Rather, a new scheduling
system should encourage more time
be spent on campus to foster an aca-
demic orientation and that campus
cohesivness W&L claims for itself.

All of this points to an alternative | |
system that includes afternoon classes. | §
Offerings could be spread out over) ©

a great many meeting times with

considerable ease and flexiblity. Stu-| >

dents would be encouraged to spend
more time on campus. Breaks be-
tween classes could be lengthened
and/or students and instructors could
be without consecutive classes.

The Lynchburg plan contains none
of this. These issues have not been |
raised, Simplicity seems a hollow |
criterion for a schedule plan on a
small campus of sophisticated and in-
telligent students, especially when it
appears to be the only criterion. (To
go further, why does the block system
have to be preserved in any form?
The surrounding female institutions
get along without it quite admirably.)

By DEAN KUMPURIS
Vice President, Dance Board

 

 

 

The IFC's deferred rush proposal
is now in limbo resting between the
IFC and the faculty. Last Thursday
the faculty Executive Committee en-
dorsed a mid-semester limited rush
plan fashioned after a plan introduced
in the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi. This
rush plan did not meet the major
faculty specification that rush be de-
ferred until after the first semester.

Last week the IFC voted to sub-
mit to the faculty the Hosford- Sto-
vall plan of limited rush which was
within the faculty’s specifications of
pledging after the first semester. The
IFC attached to the motion its strong
endorsement of the Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi plan as that proposal which
best suits the W&L campus and
environment; the faculty Executive
Committee also endorsed this plan.

Dance Plans will be announced later.
The Ring-tum Phi’s suggestion con-
cerning gates rules is a seemingly
good one, but is not feasible for two
reasons. First of all, our gym will

On the faculty meeting

The faculty’s decision to defer a decision on the deferral
of rush (!) was unquestionably in the fraternities’ best interest.
(Even we were tired after waiting two hours in the corridors
of the New Science building for some word of the outcome of
last evening’s meeting.) Whatever the last word may be, it
will be of no small import to the University—and especially

to fraternities and future freshmen—which is why nothing is
lost and much is gained by waiting until a later date to vote.
Although few disavow interest in the outcome, expediency is
not always a prerequisite for valuable action.

About the interview below

The lower portion of this page contains a lengthy but
well-worth-reading summary of the progress and thinking of
the faculty Curriculum Committee. After a year of arduous,
weekly meetings the Committee is on the verge of presenting
its proposals to the faculty—proposals which should be of in-
terest to everyone in the University. Reaction is the essence

of compromise, which is why the interview is being published:
any reactions will be appreciated, we are sure, by the Com-
mittee, whether presented directly or through the student Cur-

The Southern Conservative

Washington and Lee will not be the worse for having wit-
nessed the handsome comeback of The Southern Conservative.
The newspaper is published here in town by The News-
Gazette, paid for by private contributions (which are not
small) and patron subscriptions ($5 or more). The Editor-
in-Chief is Mr. Joe Wilson, a senior; his paper has—for the
first issue, at least—lived up to its rationale of being non-
partisan conservative analysis. It would sound a bit condescend-
ing for us to say we are glad to see the return of The South-
ern Conservative, especially under the excellent directorship

Roberts cites possible curriculum chan ges

would be a secret from anybody—
students, faculty; it was completely
open; there would be regular com-
munication so that as activities went
on in the two committees each would
know what the other was doing.

This communication of information
and ideas continued...on one or two
occasions members of the student
committee met with the faculty com-
mittee. We asked them for reactions
to the way our thinking was de-
veloping, to see what student re-
action would be...we made slow
progress last year. Ten different fac-
ulty members, ten different points
of view—this is what you expect, |
think.

But over a period of weekly meet-
ings—and we met almost every week,
all year long—lI think a general, not
unanimous, but general agreement on
certain ideas came about. Early this
fall we started back again...1 talked
with Swede Henberg (student Cur-
riculum Committee chairman) and
told him that I was in hope that by
sometime in early November we
might be able to come forward with
at least a basic proposal on the funda-
mentals of a calendar, or require-
ments for distribution and require-
ments for graduation—just the funda-
mentals. But we have not moved
quite that fast; however, our com-
mittee has now met and established
by vote, sometimes very close vote,
a general pattern...

We will recommend to the faculty,
in broad outline, a pattern which

[Editor's note: Following are ex-
cerpts from a transcribed interview
with Professor Henry S. Roberts,
chairman of the faculty Curriculum
Committee.

This interview was sought by The
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi, and is here
presented by decision of the edi-
torial board so that students may
follow the thinking of the Commit-
tee.

It must be emphasized that the
proposals pending in the Commit-

would involve a calendar of three

terms; two 12-week terms, one
from implementation, but also are, week term

to some degree, tentative.

The Committee was appointed in
the fall of 1967 by then-Acting
President Pusey; the membership
was, and still is, Professors Roberts
(chairman), Buchanan, Devogt, Du-
vall, Hodges and Jarrett (both of
whom are now on leave), Phillips,
Spencer, Stephenson, and Thomp-
son,

We express our sincere apprecia-
tion to Professor Roberts for his
time and patience in granting this
interview, and our thanks to Mr,
Charles Winston, WLUR-FM  sta-
tion manager, for his technical as-
sistance.|

Within the two 12-week
student would be taking,
pattern, four courses. Now in prac-
ticality we cant talk just about
courses because there's a difference
between, for example, the course Dr.
Jennings gives in photography which
at the present is one hour, or a course
like organic chemistry, or for that
matter comparative anatomy which
has eight hours in the classroom a
week. So we do have to talk in
terms of half-courses, and courses,
and courses-and-a-half,

But on the average we would say
that the student during the 12-week
term would take about four courses.
This would be a normal pattern.
During the short term—the 6-week
term—he would take one or two
courses. For example, if he was tak-

The committee was appointed, as
you probably know, by Dean Pusey
early last fall, somewhere about this
time. At that time Dean Pusey simply
said that he tried to get as repre-
sentative points of view from the
faculty as he could. And so it’s by
no means a stacked committee; as a
matter of fact Dean Pusey indicated—
and certainly it's true—that we just
can't expect unanimity because there
are so many different points of view

One of the first things this com-
mittee discussed then was the ques-
tion of whether it should be a faculty
committee as appointed by Dean
Pusey or whether we should have
had perhaps a joint committee. This
was discussed at some length, and
the final decision was that it should
not be a joint committee primarily
on this basis: that the work of a cur-
riculum committee is always some-
thing that goes on for several years.
It's a tremendously complicated job
we're not through. We will not really

aPPY LoseR
be through before a total of two to x's ae

three years, for the total job
We realize that necessarily students
coming in on such a committee would
be in perhaps a year and then off,
and then there would be new student
groups coming in. This creates dif
culty in terms of continuity because
new people coming in dont know
what has gone on before ,. . the back-
ground and thinking
At the same time I think we all
recognized the importance of the stu
dent point of view in communication
We talked about this with Lane
Steinger, the first student chairman
and he was rather in agreement

able to take two; if he was taking a

with this idea. And so we worked
out the understanding that nothing)
this faculty committee would do)

as a usual ||

ing a non-lab course he might be |

lab course he could probably take
only one.

Or, ‘nested studies: the sort of
things which normally cannot be ac-
complished within the regular se-
mester format. And we've talked
about various things such as a stu-
dent perhaps working on campus or
off campus in a major university
library, or in the Library of Congress,
for intensive library study in a par-
ticular area—something he couldn't
do in a regular term because it would
take him away from regular classes.

Or, geology, for example, might be
able to take their students on ex-
tended field studies, which would keep
them away from the campus for
maybe the complete period of six
weeks. And again, this is the sort
of thing which is highly desirable
and advantageous which cannot be
accomplished during a regular term
format. We've said that in biology,
for example. we might, if we could
work it out, set up a special course

in a marine laboratory for our ma-
jors during this sequence. In general,
we are suggesting that the short term
would offer an opportunity here for
departments and students to do imagi-
things

native that they cannot do

now simply because of the limita-
tions that are imposed by the semester
format.

 

We've gone a little bit further than

hat a normal student load would be
from four to four-and-a-half courses
in a 12-week term...now the idea
of that is this:

By having four courses at a time
we are not necessarily trying to make
just an easier program. What we're
trying to do is to arrive at a pro-
gram which would permit the stu-
dents, by concentrating on four
courses instead of five, to achieve
considerably greater depth. And I
think as a whole the committee
thinks this is important. In many
areas, certainly, knowledge has in-
creased so tremendously—this is true
of the sciences, it's true of many of
the political sciences and other areas
—that if we simply keep adding more
and more material to a course, and
continue to ask students to take the
same number of courses, that they
would be forced to become more and
more superficial. So this is the think-
ing behind reducing the load to,
routinely, four courses at a time. As
I say, it's not to make things easier,
it's to achieve greater depth and
thinking, and by having the short
term to achieve greater flexibility.

We would say that certain stand-
ards in terms of courses completed
would be established for achieving
class standings. For a person to be-
come a sophomore ...he would have
to have nine courses completed, nine
coures passed. ... That may at first
glance seem tough, but in fact it
isn't, and TH show you why.

To achieve junior status he would
need 18 passed courses. To achieve
senior standing he would need 27
passed courses. And to graduate, 36
| passed courses. Now you might say,
“If a man fails a course, then he
i couldn't advance with his class.”
Well, that’s not quite true. Let's take
a freshman. If he was following the
usual patiern of taking a lab science,
which would count as one-and-a-half
courses, then in each of the... 12-
week terms he would actually take
nine courses, four and a half, four and
a half.

An then in that short term he
could take one or two additional
coures so that failing a course would
not necessarily keep him from mov-
ing with his class. ....So I don't
think it's any more restrictive, in this
sense, than the present system, in
terms of quality points. And we think
it does give some incentive to pass
enough work to move along with
the class...

We are

 

 

now beginning .. to

get

  
    

 

 

into the really difficult problem of
requirements for distribution. Now
this will probably be the toughest
single thing to handle in terms of
curriculum planning.

A general philosophy...has been
developed, that we would like to see
less rigid requirements in distribution;
we would like to see greater flexibility
in general, but I believe I can speak
for the committee..and say that we
think also that if Washington and
Lee is a liberal arts college and is
going to turn out broadly-educated
students rather than specialists, we
do need some requirements in distri-
bution.

Now, if we're going to reduce the
total number of courses required for
graduation from 40 to 36, then re-
ductions have to come along the line.
And this is difficult. No one depart-
ment likes to look at, for example,
the idea that less will be required in
their department under a new pro-
gram than was required under an
old program. Some people feel that
less is required now than should be
required, and no matter what you do
in this area, if you do one thing, this
creates a series of other problems
that will have to be solved.

So this is the difficult area. We
hope...that sometime in the next
few weeks... possibly by the first of
the year or even earlier, we may be
able to come forth with a basic pro-

gram—a proposal before the faculty |

involving the points which I've just
indicated, plus requirements in dis-
tribution and for graduaiton, spelled
out in detail.

Now this is a hope. But it’s a
tough one to actually realize. We
don't feel that when this has been
done that we will have achieved the
mission of the curriculum committee.
But we feel that this is necessary for
the next important steps. Once we
have approved this, we will reacti-
vate...the faculty discussion club,
which meets only when people want
to meet. We will have a series of
meetings, the number to be determin-
ed by the need, in which the mem-
bers of the Curriculum Committee
will try to meet informally with the
faculty, outside of the context of an
official meeting to discuss, clarify,
answer questions, and maybe even
try to sell what we are proposing,
but at least to let the faculty com-
pletely understand what we're trying
to do,

After that, it will certainly be pre-

sented to the general faculty, and!

The Ring-tum

 

what will happen there no one knows.

Now I've left out, I think, one
important phase, and that is that
we would not come up with a final
proposal to go before the faculty
without having discussed this in de-
tail, and with great thoroughness,
with the student Curriculum Commit-
tee, to get their reaction, to answer
questions which they might have, and
at the same time to get suggestions
from them. So they're not being ex-
cluded from the thinking. I want to

—Photos by Honig

make this perfectly clear, we expect—
and want—to have these continued
consultations . ..

It's perhaps more likely the faculty
would modify or amend some of the
things which we will propose. Once
the faculty has taken whatever action
it will take, in terms of this basic
proposal, then we will have some
basis to go ahead to a consideration
of special programs. This will involve
honors programs, special inter-depart-
mental majors, special inter-depart-
mental courses and seminars, and...
perhaps...no major at all for un-
usual students,

This again is going to take us a
long time. So | don't expect this
committee to have completed it's mis-
sion for another year or two...

Washington and Lee’s rejuvenated
gridders gave skeptics something to
think about at Saturday’s Parents’
Weekend football game. Before a
crowd of six thousand, the Generals
completely dominated the University
of the South to the tune of 16-7.
Though the score was hardly lop-
sided, the Blue did, in fact, control
the game literally from start to
finish.

The Purple Tigers had elected to
receive, but they never did get to
make an offensive play. Jack Baizley
kicked a long squibbler which was
accidentally touched by a Sewanee
player. When the visitors tried to
down it in the end zone, W&L was
awarded a safety.

Already trailing 2-0, Sewanee now
kicked to the Generals from their
own twenty-yard line. Neither offense
could mount much of an attack in
the first few-series of plays, however,
and it looked as if the game might
turn into a rather low scoring affair.
As the quarter neared an end, though,
the Purple Tigers began to move. The
drive started on the Sewanee 25 and
was aided by two face-masking pen-
alties, one of them in a critical situa-
tion. Running expertly out of the
single-wing. fullback Bubba Owens
had taken the ball all the way to the
WAL 14. With second and five to go,
John Wolf slid through the visitors
offensive wall and nailed quarterback
Bill Blount on the 22. That would
have created a third and thirteen set-
up, but face-masking against Wolf
put the ball on the eleven, second
down and three to go. Two plays
later, Blount threw on the run from
the Generals’ front four, and con-
nected with Keith Bell in the end
zone.

Sewanee’s lead was short-lived,

however. The Blue came roaring
back immediately. Joe Dozier took
the kick-off from the twelve to the
twenty-four. Two plays later Kuhn
hit him with a pass on the 46. Another
completion, this time to Bucky Cun-
ningham, moved the ball into enemy
territory on the 44. After an off-
sides penalty netted the Blue five more
yards, Kuhn tossed another to Cun-
ningham on the twenty. Three plays
later, Kuhn completed his fourth con-
secutive pass to Cunningham just
inside the corner of the end zone
to put the Generals in the lead for
good, Jack Baizley kicked the point
after to make it 9-7 at 12:19 of
the second quarter.

After so much frustration early in
the season, the Blue were in no
mood to be merciful. Sewanee found
itself unable to move at all. They
fumbled twice before having to punt
to their own 44, The Generals got
another break, however, when the
Officials called a personal foul against
the Tigers, moving the ball to their
29.

Once more the home team smelled
blood, and once more they got it.
Quarterback Kuhn completed a pass
to John Thomas on the ten for a
first and goal. After a fumble which
was recovered by Dozier, Kuhn fired
on the run to Cunningham, kneeling
in the end zone, for his sixth straight
completion and another touchdown.
With Baizley’s conversion, the score
read 16-7 in favor of the Generals.

After once more holding Sewanee
deep in their own territory, the Blue
returned the punt to the Tigers’ 40.
They might very well have scored
again were it not for a couple of
penalties called by the officials who
were having a field day. This seemed
to break up the Generals’ momentum
for they never again mounted a seri-
ous scoring threat.

Sewanee came back fighting in the
second half. After intercepting a pass
on their own 44, they moved steadily
downfield under the direction of
Blount. Once he seemed trapped in
his own backfield around the 50 by
Wolf, but somehow he shook loose
and sprang downfield to the 31. After
a pass to Bob Akin had given the
Purple Tigers a first down on the
WAL 21, they were only able to
work themselves into a fourth and
one situation on the twelve. A touch-
down and a field goal would have
given Sewanee the lead, but they
chose to go for the first down. They
had been able to pick up short yard-
age all day, but now the Generals
defense held.

The Blue now were in the position
of being unable to move. Fourth
down forced them to punt to the
Sewanee 42. Once again, the Tigers
took up where they left off. After
driving hard they found themselves
on the 28, second and two. A line
buck by Owens was three inches
shy. Blount then tried himself, but
was thrown back a yard. On fourth
down, Owens once again missed by
inches.

With the starch removed from
them, the Tigers were no longer able
to mount an offensive. Ken Carter's
coffin corner punts kept them welded
to their own territory, and the Gen-
erals waited out the clock.

West Virginia Wesleyan downs
Generals 3-1 as season nears end

W&L’s varsity booters played what
may very well be their last game of
the season on Friday in succombing
to West Virginia Wesleyan by a 3-1
margin. The loss secures the Gen-
erals’ first losing season in ten years.

The key factor which atributed to
the W&L defeat was a lack of drive
which was markedly apparent in
Wesleyan, a team which probably
could have outplayed the Blue in
any case. The visitors came to WAL
with a five and five record. It was
their last game of the year, and they
were determined to go out with a
winning record. They did and the
price cost the Generals a 3-5-1 rec-
ord.

The booters were originally sched-
uled to play another game with
the University of Virginia late next
week, but that was called off because
it would create a ten day layoff for
the Cavaliers who finished their sea-
son on Saturday. The Generals still
have a postponed game with Roanoke
to play, but whether it will be held
is in doubt. The game will have no
influence on the Blue's eligibility
for the Virginia Inter-collegiate Soceer

 

Association Tournament. They have

already been eliminated from con-
sideration for the tournament which
they won last year.

West Virginia Wesleyan took an
early two goal lead in the first half
which the Generals were never able
to get back. Due to injuries and ill-
ness, the booters were down to a
squad fourteen men, including sub-
stitute goalies. The visitors used fif-
teen men in the first half alone.

Despite this, W&L was able to
play the West Virginians on fairly
even terms in the second half.
Weselyan garnered its third goal in
the third quarter, but the Blue did
manage to get this back in the final
period when Fred Fletcher, who play-
ed a great game, connected on a
pass from Jack Horowitz.

Because of the lack of relief help,
key men such as Horowitz, Curt
Jamison, Carl Hyatt, and Scott
Fechnay were overworked from the
beginning. Jamison came on _ well
toward the end, though, along with
a fine game by Thom Mitchell. Un-
fortunately, Fechnay has never been
completely able to come back from
his bout with pneumonia last month,
and has been shy of full strength.

 

Cross-country team places third
in CAC behind Washington, SW

Washington and Lee's harriers plac-
ed third out of the five teams com-
peting in this weekend's College
Athletic Conference championship
meet. The Generals traveled all the
way to Sewanee, Tennessee, for the
meet only to find the competition
tougher than ever before.

Since entering the CAC in 1964,
Washington University has been the
perennial cross-country power, and
this year was no exception. The Bears
placed first once again with amazing
running. Their top five runners were
all in the first ten to finish, includ-
ing the first and second slots.

Despite fine performances, the meet
had to be a disappointment for the
Blue who have taken second behind

 

the Bears in every previous meet.

This year’s third place finish was
caused by the steady improvement
shown by Southwestern in previous
years.

The lead runner for the Generals
was Harry Zeliff, who turned in his
usual good time over the three and
a quarter mile course, in finishing
fifth. Other runners who placed for
WAL were Pau! Wilbur in fifteenth,
freshman Carter Glass in seventeenth,
Dan Cogan in twenty-first, and Dave
Haydu twenty-sixth. Freshman Steve
Darsie and Ralph Pearcy were close
behind.

Washington U. had an extremely
low score of 28 points in finishing
first. Southwestern had 57 in second,
WAL 84 points for third, Centre 87
for fourth, and Sewanee brought up
the rear with 101.

Dave Kympton, Hal Catlin, and Ross
Forman who helped pilot the Gen-
erals to their CAC victory last year,

Several freshman will make their
presence well-known, John Lawlor
has been setting a torrid pace in the
butterfly and is pressing Brumback in
the freestyle sprints. Brumback, For-
man, and Lawlor will be an excellent
backbone for the freestyle events.
Last year Brumback swept up one
of the oldest standing poo! records
in the 50 yard freestyle as well as
capturing records in most of the pools
he invaded during the season.

Dave Kympton with support from
Jeff Grossman, Chuck Garten, and
freshman Bert Meem should support
the team in the 500 and 1000 yard
distance freestyle events. Kympton
presently holds the school record for
the 1650 yard event which he set at
the CAC,

The backstroke will be supported
by Billy Ball who holds conference
records in both the 100 and 200 yard
events. He is supported in this event
by Bill Kimmel. Ball, Kimmel and
Scott McElroy form the nucleus of
the individual medley event.

The Generals will also receive ex-

cellent support from returning letter-
men Roger Martin, Buddy Miller, and

Joe Phillips. Besides Lawlor and
Meem, freshman Rick Sands and
Klein Stuart show exceptional

promise.

In diving, Mike Carrere appears
to be the only diver at the moment,
Although he is easily capable of win-
ning his share of firts, the team lacks
true depth in this event.

The Generals, trying to better their
6-2 mark of last year face American
University in Lexington on December
6. American was one of the two de-
feats suffered last year, and Coach
Stearns hopes to even the score when
they return to the Doremus pool

By ROY CARLTON
Sports Editor

It may come as a complete sur-
prise to most W&L football en-
thusiasts (?), but Saturday’s victory
over Sewanee has catapulated the
Generals into a close fight for the
conference championship. Despite the
Generals 2-4-1 record, they rest in
third place in the CAC with a 1-1
record. If somehow they can manage
to win their last two games of the
season, as is quite possible, they will
find themselves tied for the champ-
ionship for the first time since 1962.

How did all this happen? First of
all the answer lies in the fact that
the Blue are not as bad a football
team as everyone has been thinking.
Early season injuries sidelined some
of the best performers on the team,
notably All-Staters Scott Mackenzie
and John Wolf, and starting halfback
Luke Crosland, among many others.

Another factor is the schedule the
Generals faced. Almost all of their
conference games are bunched to-
gether at the end of the season.
This has given several outstanding
freshmen time to learn the W&L
style of play, and a few of them have
already been absorbed into the start-
ing lineup. Dave Brooks has taken a
starting defensive halfback spot in
the lineup which was particularly
noted for its defensive backs. Brooks
has, in just four games, turned into
the finest performer in the backfield.
Tom Barton has come on to do an
excellent job in subbing for Joe
Dozier, and Mark Skoggard is a big
relief help on the defensive line.

So now the Generals are fighting
for the championship. Centre Col-
lege has already sewn up at least a
tie for first. They've already complet-
ed their conference schedule with a
three and one record. Both South-
western and Washington and Lee are
still capable of tieing, but to do so
they can't afford to lose another con-
ference game. The showdown comes
this Saturday when the Generals
travel to Memphis to face the Lynx.
Southwestern has a two and one rec-
ord, and the Blue will be the final
CAC team they'll play.

Should the Lexingtonians emerge
victorious, they will still have to meet
up with last place Washington U.
The Bears may have an 0-2 record,
but they're still not a team to be
taken lightly. They have the best de-
fense in the conference, allowing only
250.5 yds. per game. Also to their
credit is the second most productive
offense in the CAC, piling up 226.0
yds. in every outing. The Generals
are second in defense with 265 yds.
allowed per game while accumulating
only 194.8 yds. on offense, last in the
conference.

CAC Standings
Centre College 3-1-0
Southwestern 2-1-0
Washington and Lee 1-1-0
Sewanee 1-2-0

For those few people who may
have dropped over to old Doremus
Thursday night or Friday afternoon,
you may have noticed the Generals
holding their first basketball scrim-
mage this season against Fairmont
(W.Va.) State College. While the
games were informal and unofficial,
I drew several preliminary conclus-
ions about this year's roundballers.

Most obvious is that they're going
to miss the departed Mal Wesselink

 

Sewanee win boosts title hopes —

  

quite a bit. He was a great scorer
and a big help under the boards.
Against Fairmont, the Generals seem-
ed to have a very hard time working
the ball into the forwards. Mike Neer
was thus almost powerless.

The Blue may very well have
found the outside shooting they need.
Bill Rhyne was tremendous from the
outside in Friday’s game, and stands
a good chance of winning the guard
position vacated by John Carrere. A
freshman, Scott Wood, was also very
accurate from the outside, as well
as being a good playmaker for the
second-string.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

  

LETTERS 10 THE EDITOR

Dear Sirs:

It is interesting to note the depths
of puerility to which the much-vaunt-
ed Inter-Fraternity Council has most
recently sunk. Contemplate the merits
of the “shoe race” which was held
at the last football game—thanks to
the imagination of the fraternities’
representatives—and then consider
the intellectual bankruptcy which this

 

MP i cn a hy
Last night in duPont auditorium, Dr. Otis Pease of the Uni
ington history department spoke on “The Reformer and the Politician in
Recent American Politics.” One of his contentions was that Americans, today,
desire reform and not change—such as with George C. Wallace and Sen.
Eugene MeCarthy—which desire, he said, was based largely on increasing
sophistication in this country, The lecture was presented under the auspices
of the Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar Program.

short-term be for every student?

All students would have the short
term, yes. Now we do feel this, that
freshmen and sophomores would
probably, during the short term, be
primarily involved in taking courses,
one or two... At the junior or senior
level we would expect perhaps that a
large number would be involved in
special studies,.. But we're not. set-
ting up any absolutes here, this is an
expectation on our part.

Tuesday Ring-tum Phi: What kind
of choice would the students have as
to what areas they may study in?

This is something that would norm-
jally be worked out with the major
department...now we do not limit
the special area studies within the
major departments, within our think-
ing, but we feel that it would be
| worked out in conjunction with what
the student is particularly interested
in, with a faculty member who would
have to assume some sponsorship or
supervision

say that there might be a possibility,

is... that possibly they could be put
into effect next fall,... but I can’t
be too optimistic.

Some of our committee are more
optimistic about this than I am, But
we feel if we don’t do our job very
carefully and very thoroughly in terms
of planning and in terms of com-
munication of our ideas to the fac-
ulty,... then it will work against the
whole program.

To me the selling point is that if a
department will look not in terms of
the difficulty it will create but in
terms of the opportunities it will open
up for imaginative thinking about new
ways to do things and to do things
that couldn't be done before, it’s
exciting!

Now I hope...the students will
not get or be given the idea that
all of this is going to happen—we
don't know whether it’s going to
happen or not...

This is the general form our recom-
mendations to the faculty will take...
this committee has shown a lot of
imagination, a lot of flexibility, and a
complete willingness to examine new
ways to do things. And I think the
men of the committee are really due
a lot of commendation for being will-
ing to think this way.

Selective Service affects W&L

draft’ has made
noticeable inroad on enrollment at
Washington and Lee University,
especially among law students.

Figures released by registrar Harold
S. Head show that while total en-
rollment is only three less than last
year (1,458 compared with 1,461 it
has dropped by 30 in the law school
(from 216 last year to 186 presently).

Law School Dean Roy L. Stein-
heimer attributes the decline directly
to the recent Selective Service rulings
making graduate students subject to
the draft.

“Twenty-one of our second year
class—last year’s freshmen—left be-
cause of impending military service,”
Mr, Steinheimer said. “And of the
80 students whom we accepted as
freshmen this year and who planned
to enroll here 60 came. The other
20 were either drafted or about to

be

The military a

Since classes began in September,
one law student has already dropped
out because of the draft. “We antici-
pate we'll lose a few more during
the year.” Mr. Steinheimer said,

The dean has written letters to sev-
eral Selective Service boards for stu-
dents who have received draft notices.

“IT am hopeful that draft boards
are sensitive enough to the needs
of these men so that they will let
them complete at least one semester
before taking them,” he said.

Ironically the decline in enrollment
will be beneficial for the law school,
the dean feels.

“Financially it will have no effect
on us at all. In our operations it

| actually will have a good effect, mak-

ing the size of the student body more
manageable and class sizes more
realistic.”

Last year’s enrollment of 216, a

record, “simply overcrowded us,”
Dean Steinheimer observed.
Although the draft problem has

been felt at all graduate schools,
they have not been hit as hard as
some educators at first thought, Dean
Steinheimer said.

“Their worst fears weren't realiz-
ed,” he commented. “But all of them
have been affected in some way.”

attend classes, tour the campus, view
departmental displays and observe
numerous other campus activities.

Scruggs is president of Vulcan
Metals Co. in Birmingham. As chair-

Mr. Winston believed that many stu-
dents might adopt this attitude toward
the station,

Yet maintaining a staff ranging
from 45-50 students is no problem.
In addition the listening radios (with
a strong signal) range from two to
three miles and the station has been
heard as far away as six or seven
miles, a considerable distance for such
a low output. At least 340 persons
are now included on WLUR’s mail-
ing list, and Mr. Winston hopes to
have a December survey to determine
the listening audience. As well, the
wattage of the station imposes no
required number of air hours and
consequently the station is free to

feels necessary

FROGS to Meet
At Thompson’s

The Friends and Relatives of Gil-
ber and Sullivan, otherwise known as
the FROGS, will meet tonight
discuss plans for this year’s perform-
ance.

Dr. J. B. Thompson, president of
the organization, will host the meet-
ing at 8:30 p.m. in his home at 103
Rebel Ridge Drive. All interested per-
sons are welcome.

The main issue to be decided there
is the question of whether the FROGS
should restrict themselves only to
operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan or
instead diversify and include the
works of other composers.

Those favoring Gilbert and Sulli-
van are trying to decide on which of
their operettas to do. “The Gondol-
iers” and “Ruddigore” are the lead-
ing contenders for the performance
which will take place sometime in
either March or April.

The FROGS is a loose organiza-
tion of area citizens and students
whose one unifying factor is their
love of the operettas of Gilbert and
Sullivan. The entire show is a vol-
untary effort and is financed by the
Lexington Kiwanis Club

rhe proceeds from the production
go to the Kiwanis Club’s Scholarship
Fund for area high school students

Goode studied with Rudolph Serkin
at the Curtis Institute of Music be-
fore beginning his worldwide tours.

Newspapers critics have been over-
whelming in their praise of Goode.

The Washington Post commented,
“Goode plays with facile dexterity
and with a fine sense of coloration
and balance. He produced sounds
that brought the piano into its truly
great light. I have never heard it

sound so beautiful.” The Mexico City
El Nacional, reviewing his perform-

ance with their symphony, wrote,
“From the first notes the audience
knew it was in the presence of an

extraordinary musician and an extra-
ordinary pianist.”

The program for the evening will
consist of Bach’s Patria No. 1, in
B-flat Major; Beethoven's Sonata in
in E Major, opus 109; Debussy’s Five
Preludes; Le Loriot by Messiaen; and
Chopin's Polonaise Fantasy, opus 61.

Admission for students and faculty
and others may purchase
tickets at the door. This concert
the fivsi for the 1968-69 Concert
Guild Season.

Goode praise from The Lon
don Times, which said, “He already
possesses the qualities which go to
the making of an outstanding inter-
preter—a natural musicianship, imagi
nation, keen intelligence, and an ac
complished technique.”

"U” Rise Over Last Year

faculty this past week. That, all
past freshmen will remember, the

dent is doing in each of his first

minor straying, all along the break-

students who received any U's at all

any last year

In the Class of ‘72, 103 members
received only one U, while in the
Class of ‘71, however, there were
107, thus making this area the only
one which didn't follow the trend

The present freshmen contain in their

WLU R | Reaching Potential

By its activities this week, we can readily see that WLUR-
FM, Washington and Lee University’s radio station, is on the
way toward maximizing its potential as a public servant.

Under the direction of Mr. Charles E. Winston, the sta-
tion manager, WLUR-FM will expand its programming to
seven days a week when it begins regular Saturday broadcast-
ing tomorrow. This means that the station will broadcast from
7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday through Friday and from 1 p.m. to
9 p.m. on Saturday.

We were particularly impressed with the election coverage
the station broadcast Tuesday night. Any small, unafhiliated
radio station could have taken the easy way out on election
night by just giving basic returns and then falling back on
music. WLUR approached the elections from a solid informa-
tional viewpoint, never falling back on light entertainment.

Beginning at 7 p.m., 32 students began broadcasting the
election returns, which were simultaneously heard over the
Lexington station WREL. This hard corps of workers, organiz-
ed by Clark Goodwin, included political science majors, his-
tory majors and others—not just radio people. They pre-
sented in-depth analyses to the bizarre events of Tuesday
evening as they were reported over the wire dispatches.

To bolster the information coming over the national news
wires, WLUR had students stationed around the state and
in Washington, D.C. to telephone in with hourly reports.
The students phoning in from Washington, D.C. were located
at both national party headquarters and were able to get com-
ments from some of the party leaders.

The election broadcasting ended at 3:53 a.m. much to
the dislike of the broadcasters. However, it was evident nothing
would be resolved until morning.

Tomorrow WLUR will cover live from Memphis the foot-
ball game between W&L and Southwestern. At least 10 stu-
dents will be involved in this broadcast, which will include
pre-game and post-game programs. When the station signs
off tomorrow night it will have been on the air for 37 hours
this week.

Now in its third year, WLUR-FM is beginning to serve its
purpose in presenting full coverage for all public affairs and
for providing entertainment for the tastes of the students,
faculty and community. A bi-weekly newspaper like the Ring-
tum Phi cannot possibly give full coverage to all events. The
radio station will now help us to keep you informed.

Vurnax Is a Real Fan

While we’ re in a laudatory mood, we must praise the efforts
of Mr. Peter Vurnax, manager of Evans Dining Hall, for his
extreme interest in the varsity football team.

In this age of unsubsidized athletics at Washington and
Lee, there are no rewards given to football players for out-
standing performances. In most cases their achievements go
unnoticed. Wednesday night, Mr. Vurnax rewarded the team
for its upset against Sewanee by giving the players a steak
dinner.

There is no way to determine if “Acting-coach” Vurnax’s
efforts to spur the team on with the added incentive of a
steak dinner was the deciding factor in Saturday's game.
But we do know that the team recognizes that it has at least
one faithful fan and will try its best to win for him, as well
as for the school.

With fans like Mr. Vurnax, how can you lose?

A Concerned Reply

We read with some concern the comment made by a set
of “Concerned Parents” in the “Letters to the Editor’ section
of this issue on the IFC resolution to permit girls into the
upper floors of the dormitories and fraternities. The objection
these parents make is that their son and other students like
him would be subject to a . strain on self-discipline and
restraint...” if this rule were relaxed.

These parents feel that the temptations involved when
students are confronted with a “ripe’’ situation would be harm-
ful to college students who they feel are not mature
enough to be given complete freedom.”

In essence, these parents are stating that they feel students
are not capable ot defining for themselves the difference be-
tween right and wrong and that they need some guidelines
to direct them in their uncertainty.

Yet, we feel this moral crisis that these parents wish to
prevent is going to manifest itself in other ways. The difference
is in place, not in kind, The kind of temptation facing a stu-
dent in the back seat of an automobile is no different than
that in the seemingly iniquitous “upper rooms” of their fra
ternity house. The kind ot temptation a student contronts
by having a bottle of liquor out at a fraternity brother's apart-
ment is no different from having it in his room
A college education is not just the critical thinking one

Library Archives Sorted

One of the many projects begun
since the installation of Mr. Maurice
Leach as librarian is the sorting and
arranging of material collectively
grouped under the rather obscure
classification of “Archives and Rare
Books.” Under the direction of Mrs.
Henry Sloss, the project initially got
underway about a month and a half
ago and no immediate end is fore-
seen,

The material represents a wide
variety of valuable works and papers
given to the University over the
years. The collection includes papers
by such historic men as George Wash-
ington, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick
Henry, John Hancock, James Monroe,
Robert E. Lee and “Light Horse
Harry” Lee.

Works from three or four literary
societies are included in the archives.

These societies were either directly
connected with the University, of
indirectly connected by their loca

tion in Lexington. Valley newspapers
dating back to the 1700's trace the
history of the Shenandoah up to the
present. The earliest land grant of
the surrounding area has been in-
cluded as well as several indentures.

The early Byrd papers, represent
ing one of Virginia's first families,
are contained in the collection along
with several papers dealing with

my amazement, that upperclassmen

This sad tale of a freshman’s dis

hint of infallibility came as | knocked
on the door. There was a piece of
brown paper taped on the door which
had, “You have 5 days to pay your

This was only the beginning. Inside
our sophomore hero was calmly

chewing his nails and rifling through

that he was going to call some poor

Indian treaties by John C. Calhoun

Already the process of organiza-
tion has uncovered several important
documents of the Confederacy which
had been hidden since their arrival.
As the house cleaning continues other
papers may be discovered.

Mr. Leach pointed out the increas-
ed national interest the library has
received in accumulating the entire
collection of papers and letters on
important historical figures. Only re-
cently, the library has received re-
quests to view the Calhoun papers
and all documents pertaining to the

relating to its separation in Virginia.
Grants are increasingly being made

Off Weekend Road Trip
Leads to Capitol Hill —

Cal Whitehurst, a Delta Upsilonyness of the present Democratic ad

sophomore from Norfolk, Va., had
an unusual “weekend” this past week.
He went home to hear the election
returns, which sounds like a fairly
dry thing to do to liven up an off
weekend, except that the election
returns were for his father,

Dr. George W. Whitehurst was the
Republican candidate for U. $8, Con-
gress from the 2nd District, the Nor-
folk and Portsmouth area. When all
the votes were tallied Tuesday night,
Cal discovered that he had a Con-
gressman for a father, for Dr.
Whitehurst won the race, polling
more than 8,000 votes than his Demo-
ocratic Opponent.

A member of W&L’s graduating
class in 1950, Dr. Whitehurst was a
history major and president of D.U.
He went on to get his masters in
history at the University of Virginia
in 1961. That same year he became
a professor of history at Old Do-
minion College, where he is now
Dean of Students. After obtaining his
Ph.D. in 1960 at West Virginia Uni-
versity, he began a series of trips
to Europe in which he interviewed
dignitaries of various countries.

When Porter Hardy, the Demo-
cratic Congressman for his district,
retired in March of this year, Dr.
Whitehurst was asked to run for the
vacant seat by the district's Republi-
can committee. Campaigning began
in early September. Dr. Whitehurst
spoke “anywhere and everywhere be-
fore the election,” according to Cal.
Often Dr. Whitehurst debated issues
before groups with his opponent,
Fredrick T. “Bingo” Stant. The focus

 

of the debates was on the effective-

ge

 

ministraion, the ability of each to
obtain appropriations from Congress,
and the origin of each condidate’s
campaign funds.

[he night of the election, Cal and
“staff, friends, family, and interested
guests” gathered in a conference room
of a local motel to await the results.

The returns came in slowly dur-
ing the night. All the reports were
received from the Norfolk city hall
where one of Dr. Whitehurst’s
campaign managers was stationed,
Several times in the evening it ap-
peared that Dr. Whitehurst was going
to fall behind his opponent, but about
10:00, it appeared he would win.

Cal related that “all we could do
was wait. I just stood around watch-
ing the returns coming in, and oc-
casionally snatching my mother’s
drink out of her hand when photo-
graphers were taking pictures of her.”
By 11:00 Mr. Stant conceded the
election, and Dr, Whitehurst made
his victory speech. Cal recalled that
several members of the staff were
“wandering around singing calypso
songs afterward in celebration.”

Perhaps the most unusual part of
the election for Cal was when a
local newspaper photographer came
to take pictures of Dr. Whitehurst’s
son arriving home for the election.
“He couldn't decide on what sort of
picture to take and finally gave up
and took one of my mother and me
looking into my laundry bag.”

Cal’s father will be sworn in as
a Congressman on January 3, 1969,
As for Cal's reaction to the election,
he remarked, “At least this comes
only once every two years.”

Generals Try For Third Straight

 

fo bolster the morale of W&L’s
football team, Coach Leslie has ap-
proved the re-designing of cheerlead
ers costumes. These cheerleaders will

be taken along with the team to
Memphis this week in hopes that
their efforts will aid the Generals

to capture their third straight victory

Disclosing the importance of the
revamping of costumes, Coach Les
lie that the cheerleaders will
serve to distract the Southwestern
squad at crucial moments during the

does in the classroom. It is his whole experience. He gains
this experience through his academic, athletic and social life.
Most students recognize that they will be confronted with
situations that test their standards of morals, and they welcome
these tests. If they are to develop and change their standards,
it is because they, themselves have made the decisions, not
someone else.

We feel that if the student is to be given a realistic social
life, one that recognizes that the arena of testing and experi-
mentation is within the student’s mind and not in the ritulalistic
spectre of a bedroom hovering over him, the student will
become a better educated, more morally sound man. The dif-
ference is in place, not in kind.

such as tomorrow's Southwestern
game from Memphis. The broadcast-
ing is simply a “long-distance tele-
phone call” but with no telephones!
Instead a microphone is plugged into
an amplifier leading to a closed tele-
phone circuit in the press box in
Memphis which folows the telephone
lines to Roanoke and then is re-
layed to Lexington and finally the
WLUR studio. All this happens to
cost ten cents per air mile per hour,
and since Memphis is about 410 air
miles from Lexington, that two-and-
a-half hour call runs about $100. In
fact the trip, all totaled will run at
least $350 for this game alone.

“The way |

(Editor's note: “The way I see it”

comment for which contributions |
are solicited from students and

By REEVE KELSEY
News Editor

Much has been said within the!
last several years about student rights
and the student-university. The edi-
torials this week are illustrative of
this movement. Do the sophomores
living in fraternities have the right)
to the same privileges as those sopho- |
mores, juniors and seniors who live |
in apartments?

I will not take direct issue with
the Concerned Parents as that is done |
effectively by both the editorial and |

the letter to the editor. The restriction | Visiting Psychology lecturer, Dr. F. W. Fin

fraternity houses is the last major |
restriction on those living in the fra- |
ternities imposed by the faculty. The
fraternity houses as living facilities
are in limbo between dormitories and |
apartments, and I feel that they |
should be emphatically classified, at
least theoretically, as apartments.

The University requires only the
freshmen to live in dormitories prob-
ably on the theory that this is basic-
ally a year of transition between at-
home parentally-supervised living and
that of a completely self-ordered liv-
ing of the independent man.

After the freshman year the Uni-
versity does not impose any restric-
tion on where a sophomore or any
of the upperclassmen may live. Some
may pick apartments and have com-
plete access to all of the ripe moments
that they desire; a majority however
are coerced into living in the fra-
ternity houses basically to generate
the needed revenue to keep the house
running and meet mortgage payments.

Juniors and seniors, as a rule, do
not choose to live in a fraternity
house unless he is required to or
finds it advantageous for financial or
other reasons. This absence of juniors
and seniors from the fraternity house
is one of the major drawbacks to
the fraternities in the eyes of the
faculty.

rherefore it is a relatively artificial
and unconsisient rule of the faculty
that is the major stumbling block for
any influx of upperclassmen into fra-
ternity houses, The rule is discrimina-
tory against sophomore fraternity-
members in favor of non-fraternity
sophomores living in apartments, If
this rule had any theoretical justifica-
tion, why is it not universally applied
against all sophomores?

I hope that the faculty and the Stu-

Blood donations

urgently needed
for county quota

The blood drive sponsored by the
YR’s and the IFC is continuing this
week. It is imperative that WAL stu-
dents give blood toward the com-
munity quota so that blood will be
freely available to all Lexington citi-
zens and WAL students.

In past years, VMI has averaged
over 800 pints while WAL only con-
tributed 53 pints the last time the
bloodmobile was here. The blood-
mobile will be at W&L on December
12, but all students under 21 do need
permission from their parents be-
fore they can give blood,

When asked about the drive.
Chairman Bill Tyler commented,
“The reason there was such a poor
turnout five years ago was because
of the chronic disease of the campus-
apathy. The cure for apathy is the

Artist Series and the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. He has also per-
formed for the past two seasons at
the Festival of the Two Worlds in
Spoleto, Italy.

Goode studied with Rudolph Serkin
ai the Curtis Institute of Music be-
fore beginning his worldwide tours.

Newspaper critics have been over-
whelming in their praise of Goode.
The Washington Post commented,
“Goode plays with facile dexterity
and with a fine sense of coloration
and balance. He produced sounds
that brought the piano into its truly
great light. I have never heard it
sound so beautiful.”

The program for the evening will
consist of Bach’s Patria No. 1, in
B-flat Major; Beethoven's Sonata in
in E Major, opus 109; Debussy’s Five
Preludes; Le Loriot by Messiaen; and
Chopin's Polonaise Fantasy, opus 61.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Reasoning
Cc

The following letter appeared in last Friday’s Ring-tum
Phi, and we are printing it again because we have a few words
in reply. Then letter read:

We read with interest the article in The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi of
October 22, concerning the IFC motion requesting the relaxation of the
regulation restricting girls to the lower floors of fraternity houses and

dormitories.

We wish to state now that if this regulation is relaxed and our son’s
fraternity approves a plan to allow girls in the ‘upper rooms’ of fraternity
houses, we will have to ask that he resign from his fraternity. He'll have
to; we're providing the funds. If he were living at home he certainly would
not entertain his girl friends in his bedroom! Why should we condone it in
college? This is no reflection on our son; we trust him. He has been taught
that such behavior is indiscreet.

But we are not so old that we cannot remember the temptations in-
volved when two young people of Opposite sexes are alone together and the
setting is ‘ripe.’ Getting a college education today is a tough enough job
without deliberately placing an extra burden of strain on self-discipline and
restraint, from the impropriety of having girls in boys’ bedrooms.
That's what it amounts to, no matter how fancy the language you use.

aside

Despite what many college students may think, we do not believe boys
and girls of that age are mature enough to be given complete freedom. The
very fact that such a request was made is a demonstration of that lack of
maturity. One of the reasons we were so happy our son chose W&L was
because there are certain restrictions imposed, and the student is not left
entirely on his own, He recognized this himself, and welcomed the disciplines
traditional at W&L.

We managed to make it through college without ‘decorating our rooms
as we chose, without liquor in our living quarters and without members of
the opposite sex in our bedrooms; and we like to believe this generation of
college students has as much stamina as ours.

We certainly hope the University administration will have the courage
to deny this request, in the same manner that a sane parent would deny a
like request.

In his Friday staff editorial, Lawrence McConnell missed
the point (though what he did write about was well written).
The letter is rather obviously from two intelligent and reason-
able parents who are concerned that their son is in danger
of having instilled in him, with the University’s sanction, some
values which are not accepted by society.

We would like to answer—in part—this letter with two
points, in the hopes that others may be made aware of the
reasoning behind the desire to allow girls in the upper floors
of fraternities.

 

First of all, it is moot to discuss the possible outcomes of
‘ripe’ situations’ or the maturity (or lack of it) of college
students. For even now, Washington and Lee is a school
where there are—in practical terms—no restrictions whatso-
ever. We're not talking about the fact that a boy and a girl
can, if they so desire, rent a motel room. It’s easier than that.

Several of the surrounding girls’ schools no longer have
any requirements as to where a girl stays in Lexington. And

 

The Ring-tum Phi—Tuesday

Tuesday, November 12, 1968

in this college town, there are literally hundreds of student
apartments, and one is easily available to any student, fraternity
member or not, for whatever reason he may choose. And
it is their choice. A few drinks with a date, a poker game, a
night of television and records, or “the impropriety of having
girls in boys’ bedrooms.” Without meaning impudence, it
hardly matters what kind of an atmosphere parents want for
their sons at W&L.

It is not only a matter of juniors and seniors living in
apartments. Certainly the freshmen must live in dormitories,
and most sophomores are required to live in their fraternity
houses, but almost all of these people have access to a stu-
dent apartment.

We think it has to be said that students at Washington
and Lee have, for the most part, assumed this mode of living
with the decency instilled in them by their parents.

Now to the specifics of the request to allow girls in fra-
ternity bedrooms. In proposing this resolution, Mr. Kelsey,
who is a fraternity president, had in mind the fact that few
except sophomores live in fraternity houses, that this is not
in the best interest of the fraternities since there is no upper-
class guidance, that the remedy would be to entice (or force)
older students to live in the houses, and that this would be
impossible unless girls could be allowed in the bedrooms.

The point is not that “since it’s done elsewhere, why not
in the fraternity houses?” What fraternities are really asking
is for a chance to better themselves by being able to have
upperclassmen live in their houses, and to be given the chance
to achieve this end by using means which are already very
much a part of life in Lexington.

Of prime consideration in selecting an editor-in-chief of cither Ring-tum
Phi is the ability to demonstrate leadership on the staff as well as in con-
veying an opinion, In order that interested readers may judge for them-
selves this ability of possible future editors, the staff will be able to use
the editorial columns for expression of ideas and views. It is with pride
in our staff that we present the first staff editorial.

The Board of Trustees

The Board of Trustees of Vanderbilt University made a
most significant move towards improved student-administra-
tion relations in its recently conceived plan to permit the
election of an undergraduate to serve as a member of this
group.

A student will hence be elected annually by his fellow
undergraduates in the spring of his junior year to become a

full voting member of the Board for a term of one year.
The purpose of this move is “to try to narrow the generation
gap” which has been such a pre-eminent causal factor of
student disorder and unrest. By its having an undergraduate
member, the Board will be much closer to campus life, gaining
a more realistic and comprehensive perspective upon the stu-
dent situation; they will be able to realize and to serve better
the needs of the students.

A similar move at W&L might also prove to be extremely
effective, even as benign as the student situation is. The prob-
lems which face the Board of Trustees are not those of protest
and threatened violence, but rather more civil questions. W&L
has been able to handle itself quite well in the recent wave
of student riots, as it has always given the undergraduates a
large voice with which to express their views. And thus the
Board is concerned only with serving the direct needs of the
students, hence making it fertile ground for the inclusion of
a student opinion.

A student upon the Board of Trustees could indeed aid
this body in the understanding of student views and desires.
Many problems which students now encounter could be more
effectively voiced if presented in person by a student. Take
for example the case of the restriction of liquor on campus:
an undergraduate could better argue the position of the stu-
dents, showing that the abolishment of this rule would prove
to be most beneficial to all students. The dorm residents would
of course benefit most from this, but also the student body as
a whole would gain, as cocktail parties during the four dance
weekends could be held on one of the athletic fields. This
position could be explained in greater depth and with more
meaning than it has ever been previously. Perhaps this would
not cause a change in the rule, but at least it would give the
students the satisfaction that their feelings were expressed by
one of their own kind; they would also understand that the
Board was cognizant of the position of the undergraduates,
before taking action.

And so Washington and Lee might gain a great deal by
copying the action taken by the Vanderbilt board. This should
at least be considered, if mot acted upon, as the student
interests are deeply involved in this question. It will be truly
beneficial to both the students and the administration by
strengthening the ties of communication which lie between
them and by showing that the University really cares about
student views. The Board of Trustees should thus be urged
to consider the membership of a student for the improvement
of the entire Washington and Lee community.

Louisville—Nov. 17, 1951—It had
only been some ten months since
Washington and Lee’s Generals had
faced up to the University of Woym-
ing in the Gator Bowl. That had
been the climax to the most success-
ful season in W&L football history.
Now, once more, the Generals were
on the march .Despite devastating
losses to number one ranked Ten-
nessee and third ranked Maryland,
the Big Blue had racked up a 5-3
record so far, stood third in the
Southern Conference, first in Virginia,
and had even beaten the Wahoos for
the first time since 1937. They'd done
it in good style too, 42-14.

The schedule was fairly easy from
here on in. There were just two more
| games left, both pushover. Coach
| Barclay and his assistants had been
| trying to build up this game with

Modern W&L opponents can’t boast Unitas

Louisville. The Cardinals weren't
really as bad as everyone thought,
or so they tried to tell the team.
Louisville was anything but impres-
sive, though. Their record of three
wins and three losses included routs
by such “powerhouses” as Boston U.,
Cincinnati and Xavier. What would
the Generals do to them?

The scouting reports were surpris-
ing, however. Apparently, the Cardi-
nals had moved their third strong
quarterback, a freshman, up to the
starting slot. Since his promotion,
Louisville had won two out of three
and were even beginning to show
some semblance of an offense. Quart-
erback John Unitas had been termed
by the scouts as “a very fine quarter-
back with a good future.”

Still the Generals felt secure.
Theirs was the number one pass
defense in the nation, and no fresh-
man was going to cause it any strain.
Why even Tennessee had found it
impossible to throw against them.
The Vols had only completed four of
fourteen against a defense that had
allowed only 49.5 yards per game
passing.

As the captains walked to midfield
for the toss of the coin, a cold icy
wind swirled around them. Louisville

Washington and Lee’s football team
was handed a crushing defeat last
Saturday at the hands of the South-
western Lynx, 38-7. In the process

won the toss and elected to kick so
that they could take advantage of the
wind.

The Blue couldn't move the ball,
and punted to the Cardinals 46.
Louisville's ramshackle offense, fresh-
man quarterback et al., trotted onto
the field. Two line bucks produced
next to nothing, and the home team
faced a third and eight situation. The
WAL defense braced itself for a pass.
Sure enough, Unitas stepped back into
his pocket and looked for his receiv-
ers. His halfback, Babe Ray was well
downfield and all alone. Ray hauled
it in on the twenty and scooted in
for the touchdown. A fifty-two yard
TD pass with only three minutes
gone. The conversion was good for
a 7-0 lead.

Except for the ego of the defensive
secondary, this really didn’t bother
the Generals too much. Their offense
was as explosive as any around, The
Cardinals defense was more than they
had counted on, though. W&L drives
were halted on the 12, 8, and 14. A
96 yard kickoff return by Jim Wil-
liams of Louisville at the beginning
of the second half made it 14-0, and
despite a TD and numerous drives by
the Blue in the fourth quarter, the
initial seven point lead Unitas had
provided stuck.

Johnny U. didn't bother the Gen-
erals too much the rest of that
afternoon. He had done enough al-
ready. The scouting estimates of him
proved to be correct to say the least.
Al season's end, Washington and Lee
still had the stingiest defensive sec-

that shaky things were to come.
About the only warming thing in the
bitter cold at Fargason Field in
Memphis was the Memphis W&L
alumni chapter, which turned out to

cheer the Generals on.
Things started off all right for
WAL, at least for the first ten

minutes remaining in the first quarter,
the Generals recovered a Southwest-
ern fumble on the latter’s eleven yard
line. Four plays later, Doug Gossman
cracked over from the one to make
it 6-0. Jack Baizley’s extra point was
perfect and the Blue led 7-0.

The tide seemed to be in the Gen-
eral’s favor as W&L took over again
on the SW 49 yard line. However,
on the very next play, fortune de-
serted the Blue and never returned.
The Generals committed the first of
three game-breaking fumbles. South-
western recovered, and promptly
marched 55 yards in 13 plays to tie
the ball game. The tally came on a
two yard plunge by Danny Black-
wood with the extra point by Randy
Mullins.

After each side had missed a field
goal in the second period, it looked
as if the half would end in a stale-
mate. But with only about two
minutes to go W&L committed its
second bobble of the day and the
Lynx got the ball on the Generals’
42. Two McKean passes to Mullins
put the ball on the ten yard line
where the Generals’ resistance stif-
fened. Southwestern then kicked a
sixteen yard field goal to lead at
halftime 10-7.

After this, the play of the dis-
spirited Generals became lethargic.
Southwestern broke the game wide
open by adding three touchdowns in
the last four minutes. To show just
how poor the Generals tackling got,
the last TD of the game came with
just three seconds remaining. The op-
posing coach sent in a senior at
quarterback who wasn't even on the
roster. With an obvious eye at run-
ning out the clock, he simply ran a
quarterback sneak and to everyone's
surprise, especially his own, he rambl-
ed to a 47 yard score.

Although the Generals were play-
ing a competent team that executed
well, it was obvious that WAL made
them look as well as they did. As
head coach Buck Leslie noted, “We're

disappointed in the way we played.
We feel that it was a game that we
weren't ready for mentally or emo-
tionally. I don’t know if it was let-
down after the Sewanee game, or
what. We're just disappointed we
didn’t play better.”

Washington and Lee's offensive
plans of having the quarterback run-
ning wide on the option play were
hurt by Chuck Kuhn’s hurt leg and
his lingering cold. Nevertheless, the
Generals’ fieldleader was the most
potent offensive weapon the Blue
could muster, gaining 111 yards on
nineteen attempts for a 5.8 yard
average. Coach Leslie also thought
halfback Doug Gossman played well
as did John Wolf, who played on a
gimpy knee.

context of the University, but there
is a need for the Executive Com-

the ODK forum (if such a thing still
exists) to initiate proposals to be
presented to the administration or
the faculty, and for the administra-

or disagree.

Shillington. In preparation, Shilling-
ton read six different translations and
kept the best as a general guide. Some
parts of the play had to be written
by Shillington because sections of the
original work have been lost or de-

stroyed.
The cast will work with classic
costumes—gowns and masks—and

the set will be kept strictly simple. For
lack of a better word, Kahn describes
the lighting as “psychedilic” and
suggests that strobes will be used ex-
tensively.

The auditions are completely open
and, as usual, people who have never
read before are welcome. Kahn states
that he doesn’t anticipate a long or
difficult rehersal period, with Tranks-
giving vacation interveneing. The
classic will be presented in December
in what should be by then, the finish-
ed Troubadour Theatre.

Jeb Brown
Plays Lead
In ‘Bacchae’

The Troubadour Theater has
chosen as its next major production
a version of Euripides’ “The Bac-
chae,” “freely adopted for produc-
tion” from the original by Dr, J.
K. Shillington. Auditions have been
held in duPont Hall thoughout the
week for the production, which is
scheduled for December, hopefully
in a new Troubadour Theater.

In describing his work, which will
comprise the entire script of the
Washington and Lee adaptation, Dr.
Shillington reflected a desire to re-
create the Greek drama with what
he termed, “English theatrical poetry.”
This was accomplished through the
use of four different modern transla-
tions and one heavily footnoted Greek
version. (Dr. Shellington is not fa-
miliar with the actual Greek itself.)
Components of each version were
broken down, combined, sorted and
modified, much in the manner, said
Dr. Shillington, employed by Robert

Ray Prohaska,

 

Lowell in his work “Prometheus
Bound.” The end result is a modern
adaptation, extremely sincere, since
it was undertaken with an almost
total disregard of “reverence” for the
complicated ancient rhyme schemes,
that are in fact almost meaningless in
the modern theater.
Euripides’ drama dates from ap-
proximately 406-408 B.C. About the
year 300 B.C. one leaf of the manu-
script appears to have been lost.
This particular segment, dealing with
the mourning over the body of King
Pentheus, will vary from the rest of
the play in the W&L production.
Rather than rewritting from the|
works of others, Dr. Shillington creat-
ed his own scene, based upon his-
torical footnotes, to fill the void.
Troub Director Lee Kahn announc-
ed the cast early this morning. Jeb
Brown will apear as Dionysus and
Carr Garnett will play the part of
liresias. Bob Baroody won the role
of Cadmus. Hugh Hill and Dave Katz

University of Virginia Initiates

Experimental Program of Study

Students and faculty members at

step is to blot, in order to absorb

According to Prohaska, he then
proceeds “to draw in pencil very free-
ly the images which come to mind,

Although the term “monoprint”
implies one print, it is sometimes pos-
sible to make several good prints of
varied densities from one plate.

Motion Wins
By 10 to 1 Vote

By MAC BARR

Student Body President Jay Passa-
vant announced the final plans at
Tuesday night’s Executive Committee
meeting for a “Bitch-In” to be held
November 25 in Lee Chapel at 8 p.m.

Passavant said that the purpose of
the “Bitch-In” is to encourage stu-
dent participation in their govern-
ment on an informal basis. (See
further details on this page.)

Junior Year Abroad

The next order of business was
conducted by Judson Simmons, chair-
man of the Junior Year Abroad Com-
mittee. Simmons said the faculty's
Foreign Study Committee was “par-
ticularly interested in developing
close ties with programs offered by
neighboring or kindred institutions.”
However, Simmons reported that the
cost of setting up a private program,
if it is to function effectively, is en-
tirely beyond the means of W&L at
this time.

Presently a Washington and Lee
student may study for a year in
Europe if (1) he meets the basic
demands (2.5 gpr), (2) he has the
approval of his adviser and (3) he
is seeking participation in a program
operated by an accredited institution
there. This last qualification is neces-
sary as a guarantee that the ex-
perience will have solid academic
value in addition to its obvious values
for general purposes of education.

Integration Committee

In the latter part of the meeting,
EC vice president Danny Leonard
moved to eestablish an EC commit-
tee to “study the possibility of ex-
panding the University’s recruitment
program of qualified applicants with
the hope of widening the diversity
here among faculty and students and
ending utter homogeneity in the stu-
dent body.” In addition the motion
embodied a proposal to study integra-
tion policies in all facets of university
life “with the goal of achieving an
honest evaluation of this university's
commitment to the integration idea.”
| The motion was seconded by Joe
| Tompkins and passed by a vote of
'10 to 1. Bill Brown cast the lone
i dissenting vote. Stamen Ogilvie was
absent.
| Leonard and Peter Hendricks will
|do research for the committee.

 

Film Series Scheduled To Begin
At University On November 26

A series of ten films from all
over the globe will be presented at
Washington and Lee beginning No-
vember 26

The films are being sponsored by
Bradley Gunter, instructor in English,
and John Jennings, assisiant profes-
of journalism. They decided to
organize a film series at the beginning
this semester when they realized
that all good schools participated in
similar cultural programs. Their main
objective was to get as broad a range
of movies as possible

Already scheduled are two films
each from the United States, France
and Italy, and one film each from
Germany, Japan and Russia

The first showing will be “Wir
Wunderkinder” on November 26. It
deals satirically with the fortunes and
misfortunes of the German people
from the days of the Kaiser through
the Hitler era to the postward years

Discussion
For Lee

The Executive Committee of the
Student Body has planned a Bitch-In
for new policies or courses of action
in Lee Chapel.

The Bitch-In is being planned “in
an effort to bring to the forefront
those issues in the campus which
students feel have been neglected, and
as a means of offering suggestions
for new policies or course of action
that may be undertaken by the pres-
ent Executive Committee,” says Jay
Passavant, Student Body President.

Passavant emphasizes that the
“Bitch-In is not designed to be a
slanderous attack on student govern-
ment by dissatisfied students—instead
it is designed to give interested stu-
dents an opportunity to express views

 

and offer suggestions on matters they

The Bitch-In will be conducted as
an informal question and answer
period with the President of the E.C.
presiding. Questions or comments will
be entertained from the floor at the
outset of the meeting and any stu-
dent who so desires will have the
floor for a maximum of three minutes.
Danny Leonard, Pete Hendricks and
Steve Sandler of the E.C. will be
present to answer questions directed
to that body. Faculty members will
be permitted to attend, but they will
not be recognized from the floor.

The E.C. urges all students who
feel that more can be done by the
student government in various areas

ages.

A sophomore “with a distinguished
record” may be recommended by
Washington and Lee to study Arabic,
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Persian,
Russian, or Turkish (and related reg-
ional studies) at Princeton University
during his junior year. He must en-
roll for preliminary intensive language
training at a summer institute prior
to atending Princeton. Upon complet-
ing his junior year and usually
another summer institute, he will re-
turn to Washington and Lee to com-
plete his degree work here.

Mid-Semester Reports
Released For Freshmen

Indicate Marked Drop

Mid-term grades, issued to fresh-
men this week, seem to confirm the
trend indicated by the § and U grades
released a few weeks ago.

This year there were 182 failure
notices given as of mid-semester,
compared with 121 for last year, 124
for 1966 and 74 for 1965.

Breaking these figures down, it is
found that 99 students received one
F this year, compared with 73 last
year, 54 in 1966 and 52 in 1965
The remainder of the breakdown
shows a similar patiern, with the
category of three failures the only
one in which a previous year exceed-
ed this year. In 1966 one student
received six F's, while this year the
record was only five.

Although the increase in failures
can be accounted for in part by the
increase in the number of students
in this year’s freshman class (362)
compared with previous classes (297

| in 1967), this does not fully explain

the trend, for it ignores the fact that
this year’s freshmen did appreciably
worse than the class of 1970, which
contains 320 members, did two years
ago.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tium Phi
Friday

Friday, November 15, 1968

Are Students Interested?

We thoroughly agree with Reed Byrum’s signed editorial
in the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi urging student body representa-
tion on the University’s Board of Trustees. A student on the
Board of Trustees would certainly be in an excellent position
to explain to this body the desires and ideas of the student
body. We believe that the benefits that could be gained by
such action would result in many important advances (much
more important than liberalizing liquor rules on campus, as
was stated in the editorial) .

However, we wonder how many students are actually
interested in the University. We wonder how many students
are willing to propose constructive ideas and take part in
seeing these ideas formulated into action. Furthermore, we
wonder why so many students who have gripes about the
operations of the University and its varied segments keep
them to themselves, not willing (or caring) to bring them out
into the open.

The student body will have an opportunity to show its
interest in the University at the Executive Committee spon-
sored “Bitch-In,” scheduled for November 25. The purpose
of this informal gathering will be to encourage student partici-
pation in their government and to bring to the forefront issues
which students feel have been ignored or forgotten. Students
will also be encouraged to make constructive proposals to the

EC.

If student body response is overwhelming (which it ought
to be), then the Board of Trustees will see that students are
interested in their school. This would encourage them to put
a student representative on the Board, On the other hand, if
response is small, we will have gained nothing and lost an
opportunity to make ourselves heard.

If we really want a voice in what is going on at Washing-
ton and Lee, we will have to go out of our way to show we
do. No one will give us additional privileges until we are will-
ing to work for them, and no one will give us more responsi-
bilities unless we prove we are willing to accept them maturely.

No Stags Allowed

We strongly believe that open fraternity parties belong at
Washington and Lee. It is this custom which brings the student
body together for social rather than academic endeavors.

However, there is one thing we strongly urge the Interfra-
ternity Council to consider in order to make these parties more
enjoyable for everyone concerned. We ask that the IFC forbid
all males without dates (commonly known as stags) from going
into any fraternity parties, other than their own, without
invitations.

There are several valid reasons why this rule should be
put into effect. First, stags generally tend to be more obnoxi-
ous than students with dates. They enter another fraternity
house as guests of that fraternity and then proceed to get
drunk and bother couples around them. It is not uncommon
to see stags jumping up and down on the furniture or see
them roaming around trying to pick up dates. These kinds of
actions and others like them can create uncomfortable and
often violent situations.

Secondly, the stags themselves may become targets for
drunken students who may be trying to impress their dates.

 

 

Letters To The Editor...

 

 

Reasoning?

To the Editor:

I was somewhat surprised to read
Mr. Honig’s statement in the Tues-
day Ring-tum Phi that Lawrence Mc-
Connell had missed the point in his
editorial of 11/8/68. I read on ex-|
pecting to find out Mr. McConnell’s |
error, but at the end of the edi-
torial | was no more informed. After
several re-readings, | thought that Mr.
Honig had not refuted Mr. McCon-
nell, but had only shifted his em-
phasis. Mr. McConnell had stated that
the difference was “...in place, not
in kind.” Mr. Honig pointed out that
there are sufficient apartments so that
any student might have ample access,
which tended to corroborate Mr. Mc-
Connell.

It appeared that Mr. Honig, in
shifting his emphasis, was attempting
to make the proposal more palatable
to both parents and faculty. A parent
might balk at his son’s having un-
limited social contact, saying he is
not yet mature enough to be tempted
by such “ripe” situations. What par-
ent, however, could say that he had
failed to instill any “decency” in his
son?

Mr. Honig also says that allowing
girls in the upper floors of a fra-
ternity house would encourage more
upperclassmen to live in, thus better-
ing the lot of fraternities, and also
providing more upperclass “guidance.”
Mr. Honig has cleverly put the fac-
ulty on the defensive, implying that
a failure to allow this rule would
deny fraternities the chance to better
themselves.

Mr. Honig started his editorial with
the unfair statement that Mr. Mce-
Connell was wrong. He does nothing
to prove his accusation, but for some
reason saw fit to include it. In fact,
in his conclusion he says that fra-
ternities want to better themselves
“ .. by using the means which are
already very much a part of life in
Lexington.” This is exactly what Me-
Connel means when he says the
difference will be “...in place, not
in kind.” Mr. Honig’s whole editorial
merely rewords Mr. McConnell’s, al-
though he says that McConnell’s was
wrong. It would seem that one in Mr.
Honig’s position and responsibility
should not make such claims, especi-
ally as he goes on to substantiate
what he has already called false.

Another Concerned Parent

To the Editor:

Permit me to comment on the
“Concerned Reply” editorial in the
Friday Ring-tum Phi. [| do so not
as a faculty member but as the father
of three girls who someday, perhaps,
will be college students. Washington
and Lee is a gentlemen's school and
a gentleman does not put a lady in
a compromising situation,

Admittedly, I did not exactly think
this way when I was an undergraduate
at Yale close to thirty years ago and
I cannot really | suppose take to
task undergraduates for scepticism
about it now. There is the under-
graduate point of view and there is
parental point of view. They conflict.
And it is no wonder. For what the
parent is saying is that sex can be
fun, indeed should be, but that it

 

An incident like this occurred during Homecomings Weekend
and resulted in a broken cheek bone for an innocent stag.

A third reason for this rule is to keep unknown stags from |
entering the fraternity parties. Students from other campuses
often come to W&L without dates to take part in the festivi- |
ties. Stag “townies” may also decide to attend the parties. |
These two groups are more prone to make trouble because |
of their obscured identities. Whenever they do make trouble, |
W&L students bear the brunt of the blame. |

There are more examples of incidents which might have |
been averted if a rule such as the one we are asking for had
been in effect. This rule will not forbid stags from attending
their own fraternity parties. All it will do is to forbid unknown |
stags from entering the parties and allow, by invitation only,
stags who are desired by the members of the fraternity.

If we want to keep our fraternity parties open to other
students and their dates and if we want these parties to be
unmarred by unpleasant incidents, the IFC must take action
immediately.

Prejudices DO Exist

Dear Sirs:

An angry voice has been raised at
Washington and Lee in the past two
weeks—the voice of those enlightened
few who freely preach social and
especially racial “justice” to the
“bigoted” middle-class. These right-
thinking students are convinced that
it is unfair to prevent a young lady
from staying overnight in a_ hostile
atmosphere, where she is distinctly
not wanted, I certainly would not
sacrifice the comfort of a girl by
placing her in such an atmosphere.
But idealists rarely think of this con-
sideration.

Several of our more obsessed
campus liberals are indeed appalled
to find that in Lexington, relatively
“advanced” as it is, there are people
who do not like those of another
color and that there are “prejudices.”
Of course there are prejudices, even
in the United States of America, the
melting pot of the world; alas, the
melting pot did not transform all of
our various races and cultures into
one unified mass, dedicated to the
hypothesis that all men are created
equal. People are after all different
from each other, even if these dif-

ferences are only superficial; and
these differences breed dislikes and
distrust.

Maybe people have totally un-
founded reasons for their pre-
judices, but the prejudices are still
there; and though the intellectuals
are not aware of it, these are stead-
fast prejudices, for they have had
two and three hundred years to
become hardened. No amount of
praying, parading, rioting, boy-
cotting, or damning is going to re-
verse public sentiment in any fore-
seeable future.

The integrationist radical is de-
termined to erase his pet injustice at
whatever cost of law and social
peace. The national majority grows
daily more exasperated and daily
more alarmed at the battering-ram ap-
proach of racial revolutionaries who
concede no diversity of social cus-
toms in the area of race, but insist on
universal and compulsory fulfillment
of the dream of integration.

Take your dates where you please
and let them stay wherever they are
| welcome; consider your reasons for
iyour choice in overnight lodgings;
jand remember that crusaders are al-

ways arrogant, always  uniovable,
often defeated, and very often wrong.

His character strikes us as familiar |
because we have seen it so often—|
in movies: its use here indicates a
fundamental softness in the film's
head, and probably in its heart. Later
the daughter turns on the doctor for
what she considers his unwillingness
to protect her husband against blatant
white injustice. “I don't know how
good a hater | am,” she declares,
“I got a feeling I'm a mighty good
hater!” A lesson in what whites have
done to blacks? Nonsense. Self-con-
gratulation on our enlightenment at
seeing Negro “problems.”

here are similar faults through- |
out the film, culminating in that

to a manageable level, the same way

his senses are limited. All the in-
volvement he allows himself is an
occasional clearly beneficial good

turn. It’s nice to be able to do good
from an insecure position, ..

We look for the New American
Cinema in the wrong place. We like
to be told the truth, assured that the
truth we hear is true. As an audience
we want movies to held our hand.
The movies oblige, giggling shyly at
first and then dominating the rela-
tionship. We and the cinema tell
each other the same secrets, pleased
to have them on independent author-
ity. We gain knowledge without work-
ing for it. Sentimental love affairs

Seventeen Generals To Retire Again

Zeliff Leads Harriers
In Rebuilding Year

By MIKE HOSFORD |

This year’s cross-country team has |
been somewhat less than sterling, but |
there have nevertheless been several |
bright spots, the main one being co-|
captain Harry Zeliff.

Zeliff is a Phi Ep senior from
Staunton, Virginia, majoring in Eng-
lish. He has consistently been on the |
dean’s list. His perseverence is of a
stoic nature, and his hard work is
rarely known because of his modesty.
In spite of this modesty, it should be
known that he has been largely re-
sponsible for the success of the cross-

country team this year. The team
returned this year perhaps weaker
than ever after the loss of Corbet

Bryant and Bob Stack to graduation.

Zeliff’s biggest asset has been his
ability to come through in the clutch,
and over the past two years he has
done plenty of it. In his sophomore
year, his first year at cross-country,
he ran a consistent sixth or seventh

Pearcy was injured and never got|
Bob Stack
also was hurt, never reaching his full
potential in his last year. Corbet
Bryant, always a steady runner, con-
tracted mononucleosis and never was
able to come back strong. Zeliff was
about the only bright spot last year,
as he consistently ran in the top three
and placed in the CAC tournament,
This year’s story has been much
the same. Ralph Pearcy has not been
in top form, and most of the sopho-
mores and others are still spotty run-
ners at best. Replacement has been
a severe problem. In addition, the loss
of both Bryant and Stack have hamp- |
ered the harriers’ hopes this season.
Zeliff has been the only runner of
real distinction, placing first in al-
most every meet this year, with a fifth

k “Execept for two earthquakes, fly
| ing back in a snowstorm, and almost
hitting a drunk on the way home, we
had a pretty good day.”

That is how Washington and Lee
football coach Buck Leslie describes
what happened to him and the Gen-
erals last Saturday. The first earth-
quake—a real one—shook the Gen-
erals’ hotel in} Memphis Saturday
morning; the other one came in the
second half of the W&L-Southwestern
game when the Lynx exploded for a
38-7 triumph.

Coach Leslie might have mention-
ed a few other things that happened
Saturday. Like the assistant coach
who lost 19 of the airline tickets, or
the private plane which nosed over
on the runway at Winston-Salem,
delaying the W&L flight and forcing
all sorts of schedule-juggling.

But the worst was the Southwestern
earthquake which knocked the Gen-
erals out of a chance for the College
Athletic Conference co-championship.
By winning, Southwestern gained a
share of the title with Centre, Both
have finished their conference seasons
with 3-1 marks.

The Generals close out their
son Saturday at home against Wash-
ington University of St. Louis in a
battle of the also-rans. Both teams
are having down years: Washington
is 2-7 overall and 0-3 in the con-
ference, while W&L is only slightly
better at 2-5-1 and 1-2.

Coach Leslie feels the Battlin
Bears’ record is deceiving, however
“All three of their losses in the con
ference have been very close, and |
that’s what I look at. We dont
think they are weak at all.”

and I immediately forgot about the
small problems.

The transition that can be made in
a bathroom is really amazing. Totally
grubby guys would go into johns,
closets, or phone booths, and come
out dressed in tuxes or suits. A
definite revival of the old Superman-
in-the-phone-booth routine.

The snow was beautiful. Several
drivers must have enthralled by it,
as there were many cars on_ the
sides of the road, What really bother-
ed me was the traffic jam on the
median strip.

The Formal turned out to be a
success. I actually survived it with-
out any major mishaps. My usual
luck had not forsaken me _ though.
The snow was rapidly accumulating,

-|and the roads were correspondingly

getting worse. The decision was made
to find a motel room and sleep off

-|the storm. Fine, but where do you

look for a room at 2 a.m.?

Moreau has written numerous essays

cause it confirms that we always
thought. Films which disturb—Bon-
nie and Clyde—get turned into ads,

irony.

Arkin resurrects the New American
Cinema by giving a performance full
of passionate intelligence. There
sems to be no other way. If Arkin
is profoundly moving almost from
his first moment on the screen, it is
not because he sets out to move us
but because he enters his character
all the way and emerges on the other
side. Actors seldom listen the way
Arkin listens—the way a deaf-mute
listens! His movie must be seen, and
quickly.

The New Republic

Registraion rolls are heavy with
voters who will shed no tear at the
repudiation of the incumbent Ad-
ministration, and raise no cheer at the
prospect of Richard Nixon in the
White House. We are at home in
that company. The National Demo-
cratic Party was buried by its man-
agers earlier this year, and it can’t
be resurrected in time to win this
November. Tom Wicker of The New
York Times observed last week that
Eugene McCarty’s good opinion is
being “more avidly sought by the
Democrats now than it was last
August in Chicago, or during the
long, hot summer when he sought
delegate support, only to be met by
an unbroken panorama of ‘profes-
sional’ Democratic politicians with
their heads in the sand, the resulting
position of their rumps inviting the
kicks they are now getting.” In early
1960, Senator Humphrey seemed to
us just the right man to be President.
Today, we and many others who
thought the same feel like the long-
dead boss of the New York Demo-
crats, who, asked if he would sup-
port William Jennings Bryan in 1896,
replied: “I am a. . . Democrat still,
very still.” Why? Vietnam, to begin
with. Neither Humphrey nor Nixon
has spoken the ruth—that this never
was a war that should have been
fought by the United States. Nor has
either said, even in general terms,
how he thinks the conflict can be
brought to an end without further
devastation. A partial bombing halt
is as useful as a broken button; a
total halt is only a prelude to negotia-
tions. Mr. Humphrey’s opponents may
argue that they have not been in
charge and are not therefore re-
sponsible for this disaster. It is a
proper but thin defense, since neither
Nixon nor Wallace has criticized the
essentials of the Johnson policy. They
were freer than Humphrey to speak,
but they had nothing sensible to say.

Their complicity does not, of
course, absolve the Vice President
He had a chance as late as the
Democratic National Convention to
get off the Johnson line. He might
then have endorsed the moderate
minority position of Vietnam; instead,
he went along with the extremists,
and he went along when the police
clubbed and gassed protestors in the
streets. One's sympathy for Hum-
phrey is not sweetened by the tale
(always privately told) that he really
has grave doubts about the bombing.
Loyalties deeper than an obligation
to one’s team have been challenged
by this war. Whether the Vice Presi-
dent had it in him to break free, to
appreciate and reflect the depth of
the anti,war sentiment and the reasons
for it, is an academic question, We
know what we're given. The Admini-
stration policies to which Mr, Hum-
phrey gave himself ardently, ovt-
rageously, are now to be judged, It
is right that they be judged, Repre-
sentative government requires that
power be held to account, Evasion of
accountability breeds the sort of
cynicism illustrated last week by a
remark of John Kenneth Galbraith,
Asked whether Americans for Demo-
cratic Action, having just endorsed
Humphrey, no longer thought he was
a “candidate of the past” (as he had
been to ADA some weeks earlier),
ADA's chairman ventured the philo-
sophy that “Nothing is so admirable
in politics as a short memory,”

Hubert Humphrey is no war lover.
But neither is Nixon nor Lyndon
Johnson, (One can't be sure about
Wallace.) We assume that Nixon or
Humphrey would, as President, find
a way out of the dead-end of Viet-
nam, under strong pressures to shift
the balance of national expenditures
more heavily onto the side of do-
mestic rehabiliation. A new Admini-
stration will try hard to make peace,
moreover, because if it does not,
militant protest will make its life
unbearable. And surely amy new Ad-

will do something for the
ghettoes, and for the same reason
if it doesn’t its life will be unbear-
able. Mr. Humphrey is doubtless the
more “liberal” nominee, if by lib-
eral one means a willingness fo use
public resources to meet public needs.
He has made constructive proposals
avout federal investment in urban te
newal and education, He does ne
care about the least favored, and
the polls show that he has the com
fidence, as Nixon does not, of most
of the black community, Thal is pot
» trivial asset, for racial peace will
no be won by bayonets but by good-
will and good works, And finally,

Humphrey has had the wit to select a

 

That much being said, it must be
added that considering the disarray of
the Democratic Party, the character
of some of Humphrey’s allies (George
Meany, for instance), the anger and
frustration of the young and not so
young, the rise of right-wing radical-
ism and the probability of a more
conservative Congress in "69, it is hard
to imagine Humphrey’s mustering suf-
ficient power as President to cope
with our crises, We take it that this,
roughly, is the opinion of Walter
Lippmann. He believes that a Re-
publican Administration could more
easily end the war without stirring
up a hornet’s nest among the rabid
anti-communists, that a Nixon Ad-
ministration would be better placed
to draw some of the poison from the
vigilante right, and that in any case,
power should be given the out party
from time to time; it must in some
fashion come to grips with reality.
And the Democrats, no longer obliged
to defer to the man in the White
House, may speak more candidly,
more objectively about the nations
problems.

So why not Nixon? Men change,
and reporters who have been travel-
ing with him, including our own,
say that he is more genial than he
was, more secure, that his organiza-
tion is superb and that he is sur-
rounded by smart people. Would he
not be a more efficient, more political
Eisenhower? Perhaps he would. But
here come those unadmirable, nag-
ging memories. The record of Nixon’s
rise to eminence on the backs of sus-
pected “subversives,” of his uninvol-
vement with any of the central prob-
lems in our society, of his cheap
showmanship in Latin America and
in the Soviet Union is a familiar
story—to anyone over 25, And mem-
ories are not the whole of it. If
Nixon differs with the present Secre-

power, those differences can be cali-
brated in micro-units. His references
to “de-Americanizing” the war are
as vague, as unreliable, as the same
sentiments when expressed by Lyndon
Johnson.

The Republican nominee is for
rights, but would be reluctant

eral government to see that they are
enforced. To the cities, he offers his
faith that subsidized “free” enterprise
will find jobs for the unemployed,
educate the poorly skilled, build low-
income housing. And, as TRB re-
ports, he suggests it all cam be done
while raising defense expenditures
(more nuclear-powered ships, a high-
er-paid volunteer army), cutting the
budget and perhaps cutting taxes. He
favors “black capitalism,” but gives
no clue to the means by which poor
Negroes, lacking funds or managerial

, are to create the enter-
prises by which they are to lift them-
selves out of poverty, He would
rescue business from bureaucratice
harassment, in the hope that freer

from public surveillance, business
would somehow become more fe-
sponsible.

Then there's Agnew, uninformed,
tactless, a man who might have been
living in outer space this past decade
for all one can tell from his obtuse
utterances.

Choose if you can.

Unless the polls are wildly wrong,
this country will have a conservative
interregnum of at least four years.
It is not a time from which to expect
great leaps forward. If we are lucky,
Mr. Nixon will keep the lid from
blowing off—by not sitting on it too
tightly; crises will be ridden out. And,
meanwhile, new political energies and
ideas will find new forms,

They can be useful years of re-
appraisal and reorganization by the
outs—and not just reappraisal and re-
organizaion of the electoral process
or of the Democratic Party. Institu-
tions of all kinds, from labor unions
to Columbia University to the Catho-
lic Archdiocese of Washington, D.C
are decrepit. If they are not up
dated, they will be incapable of re-
sponding to modern-day needs and
desires, The unions particularly will
have to produce new spokesmen, new
educational programs if they are to
become a revitalizing force that com
mands respect. The academic com-

Quo vadit honor

In a series of recent actions Mr. Neil
Kessler, the Editor-in-Chief of The Friday
Ring-tum Phi, has called into question his
honor and the integrity of the newspaper. In
addition, what has happened has seriously im-
paired our faith in the application of the
Honor Code. With the failure of the Execu-
tive Committee and of the Publications Board’
to resolve effectively the issues at hand, it is
incumbent upon us to act as spokesman of
a responsible student body. We lay the facts
before our readers.

On October 19, 1968, The New Re-
public published an editorial entitled “Choose
If You Can.” This is reprinted” to the
left. On Friday, October 25, Mr. Kessler
published an editorial entitled “Choose A
Candiate—If You Can .. .” This is re-
printed to the right. In each editorial, all
duplicate words are in bold face type. Note
this similarity of text.

An official publication of this school en-
titled “Written Work and the Honor System
at Washington and Lee University” states
that “If the writer presents this . . . a close
paraphrase which is esentially a direct quota-
tion .. . as his own work, without the use of
any quotation marks, he is guilty of patent dis-
honesty. His use of a footnote alone is not
enough. Here is a clear-cut case of plagiarism
which can be demonstrated by a close exami-
nation of the passage . . . despite the changes,
however, the paragraph is in no sense the
writer’s own.” The Executive Committee met
on Tuesday, October 29, and decided that
Mr. Kessler’s actions did not fall under its
jurisdiction; this was not considered as plagi-
arism. We ask our readers, why was this
decision made?

The following Tuesday, November 4, the

 

“Composed of all regularly matriculated, present and
former Editors and Business Managers of the various
publications, namely: The Ring-tum Phi, The Calyx,
_ and the Director of Photography . . . and

and Ariel . .
one Alumnus and one Faculty Representative . .
Publications Board Constitution, section 4.

Publications Board met to consider this case.
During the course of his testimony to that
body, Mr. Kessler said that he had read The
New Republic, put it aside, and then had
written his editorial. Upon subsequent ques-
tioning, he said flatly that he had not looked
at The New Republic while writing his edi-
torial. Later, however, when asked for the
third time about this specific, he changed his
testimony, admitting that he had, in fact,
made use of the magazine throughout his writ-
ing of The Ring-tum Phi editorial. Despite the
overwhelming evidence on both questions,
the Publications Board failed to remove Mr.
Kessler as editor."

We do not, here, take issue with the
decisions reached by either the Executive
Committee or the Publications Board. Their
policies, if they are to be changed, must be
examined deliberately and comprehensively
by the student body and altered by due consti-
tutional processes.

On two counts, Mr. Kessler has proven
his disregard for the basic competence requir-
ed of an editor—especially since he represents
this University, which necessitates that he
exemplify General Lee’s honor. Mr. Kesslet’s
offenses can only cause both our confidence
in him and our faith in the application of the
Honor Code itself to be sharply diminished.

Mr. Kessler has been given ample op-
portunity—and more than ample justifica-
tion—to tender his resignation from the
editorship. How many walls must a man be
forced to face before the handwriting is also
seen? It is now, for Mr. Kessler, a question
of personal honor; quo vadit honor, we
wonder.

It is for these reasons we demand Mr.
Kessler’s immediate resignation as Editor-in-

Chief of The Ring-tum Phi.

For many of us this will be our
first opportunity to vote in a national
presidential election, And _ frankly,
we are disillusioned.

We are disillusioned about the na-
tional nominating conventions; we
are distatisfied with the hypocrisy of
politics, i.e., saying one thing to
get votes and doing another; we
object to the electoral college which
completely ignores the minority vote
in a state; and, above all, we are
unhappy about the candidates we have
to choose from. We will shed no
tear at the repudiation of the incum-
bent Administration, and raise no
cheer at the prospect of Richard
Nixon in the White House.

Neither Humphrey nor Nixon has
spoken the truth on Vietnam—that
this never was a war that should
have been fought by the United
States. Nor has either said, even in
general terms, how he thinks the con-
flict can be brought to an end with-
out further loss of life and destruc-
tion. Humphrey's opponents argue
that they have not been in charge
and are not therefore responsible for
this disaster. This a valid but weak
defense, since neither Nixon nor Wal-
lace has criticized the essentials of
the Johnson policy, They are freer
than Humphrey to speak, but they
have not said anything meaningful.

This does not make the Vice Presi-
dent any less guilty. He, too, has
had a chance to get off the Johnson
line. He might have endorsed the
moderate minority position on Viet-
at the Democratic National
Convention. Instead, he supported the
extremists, and he defended the police
for clubbing and gassing protsters in
the streets. Our thoughts’ on
Humphrey are not enhanced when
we hear that privately he really has
had grave doubts about the bomb-
ing. The Administration policies to
which Humphrey gave himself ard-
ently are now to be judged. This
is the way it should be. And this
hurts him, too, unless he repudiates
them.

Hubert Humphrey, we believe, is
no war lover, But neither is Nixon
or Lyndon Johnson, (We can't be
sure about George Wallace and his
ridiculous sidekick LeMay.) We as-
sume that both of the major candi-
dates would get us out of Vietnam,

Staff editorial

 

The faculty as a legislature?

This term at W&L has seen the faculty emerge as seem-
ingly a dominant political force on the campus in many areas
of University life. Whether this trend is good or bad may
be merely academic, but I have serious doubts as to the ability
of the faculty, as a whole, to reason together efficiently under
their present structure.

This semester has seen the faculty having jurisdiction over
both the system of rush for the fraternities and the question
of the 5-day week, as well as the probable jurisdiction over
the recently proposed curriculum reforms. This year the
faculty has already had one special meeting to discuss Saturday
classes, and they plan another special meeting in early Decem-
ber. The agenda for the December 2 meeting is deferred
rush, and a meeting is scheduled for December 9 on the 5-day
week. This all points to the definite need for a new legislative
arrangement for the faculty, as the present system is much
too cumbersome and slow to meet the potential legislative
demands placed upon it.

Since the 5-day week proposal emerged from the special
faculty committee late in September, the faculty has virtually
scrapped the committee report and started from scratch. In
fact, the leading contender at the moment appears to be a
modification of a plan that had no support at all on the faculty
committee. Even yet, the faculty has had one extra meeting
on the 5-day week and may have even more before concluding
its discussion on Saturday classes.

There also appears to be a rather surprising lack of con-
trol or organization. Involved in the 5-day class debate is
first whether there should be only 5 days of classes and second
how is the schedule to be adjusted. It would seem most logical
to resolve the first issue then proceed to the second if necessary.
However, it appears that the faculty is attacking both problems
at once and if it is not even the will of the faculty to go to
the 5-day week, tremendous amounts of time will have been
expended on working up an adequate schedule.

Deferred rush provides a very similar example; the IFC,
under extreme pressure, was required to have a plan ready
for the November faculty meeting. As students are not privy
to the minutes of the faculty meetings, it appears as if faculty
debate and discussion over the issue are also far from com-
plete. Considering the momentous problems that the faculty
may have to face depending upon which plan they approve,
it would appear that prompt action would be most desirable.

No one can foretell how long the curriculum changes will
be under discussion before the faculty reaches their decision,
and one always has the fond hope that the proposed changes
will merely be the first of many involving the curriculum.

My basic point of contention is not the legitimacy of the
faculty’s jurisdiction over these matters, but the faculty as a
rule-making body. A group of 120 or so men, meeting once a
month for an hour and a half (according to faculty by-laws,
they must adjourn at 6 p.m.) cannot efficiently exert con-
tinuous, progressive, and active authority in all the areas which
they have tentatively entered.

In any group this large, in fact in many even smaller, there
are those who must have their own pet views heard and reheard
and there are those who must advance their own, often un-
realistic, motions which must be discussed and defeated. It
would seem that the faculty must either delegate its authority
to a smaller group or relinquish it. This delegation could be a
body of 30 or so faculty members selected by a mixed system
of election and ex officio criterion or it could be an almost
explicit agreement to automatically pass whatever is recom-
mended by a given committee.

There are those who doubt the faculty’s authority over
many of these issues. Do they have the authority to determine
what system the fraternities must rush by? Does this power
basically belong to the fraternities themselves unless reform
is urgently past due? Does not the administration have a more
basic claim to determination of the 5- or 6-day week? Should
not the students have some voice along the way in the structure
of the curriculum? Or should not the president of the Uni-
versity be given absolute authority to construct a unified plan
of curriculum in line with his theories of the liberal arts col-
lege? Can the faculty, as a collection of various departmental
and personal interests, devise a consistent theory of the cur-
riculum? If the faculty can not responsibly handle the powers
it has assumed, I feel they should be returned to the fraterni-
ties, the administration, or, perhaps, even the students.

Riegel charges

news reporters

to tell full story

Professor Oscar W. Riegel, in an
article for the Summer 1968 edition
of the “College and University Jour-
nal.” has urged today’s newsmen to

“tell it like it is.” The article was
reprinted in the November edition
of the American Society of News-

paper Editors’ “Bulletin.”

Journalism professor and former
head of the department, Professor
Riegel! has had a varied journalistic
career. He is the author of two books,
“Mobilizing for Chaos, The Story of
the New Propaganda” and “Crown of
Glory, The Life of James John
Strang, Moses of the Mormans.”

Professor Riegel, in addition, has
written articles for such respected
publications as the Richmond Times-
Dispatch, the Christian Science Moni-
tor, and the Public Opinion Quarterly.

Before joining the Washington and
Lee faculty in 1930, Professor Riegel
had held positions on the staffs of
the Chicago Tribune and the New
York Daily News. He has been a
foreign correspondent, traveling wide-
ly in both western and eastern Europe
and Central America. Professor
Riegel is also a member of Omicron
Delta Kappa, Phi Beta Kappa, and
Sigma Delta Chi.

In his article, Professor Riegel
praises today’s newspapermen for be-
ing “neater and cleaner... much more
stable . . . and more sophisticated in
technical knowledge.” However, he
has some criticisms as well.

For example, he feels that “news-
papermen seem less irreverent now,
less innovative, less smart-alecky, less
wide-ranging and curious in their in-
terests, less willing to whack away at
all forms of pretentiousness and
human folly.”

Professor Riegel also feels that the
American journalist has become
identified with and sympathetic to
“the Establishment,” which causes him
to largely ignore and gloss over the
dissatisfied and revolutionary forces
throughout the world.

As a result of this complacency on
the part of American newspapermen,
Professor Riegel writes that the pub-
lic is “constantly being taken by sur-
prise.” He continues: “We resent not
only the events themselves that sur-
prise us, but also the information
channels that didn’t prepare us for

piano, will offer a program of Lieder. them.”

extensive collection of original letters,
a few from notable historical figures
such as Robert E. Lee and Thomas
Jefferson, but most of them from
ordinary Lexington citizens of the
past.

“Many of these letters may seem
insignificant,” Dr. Turner remarked,
“But sometimes they can provide in-
teresting material for research papers
and may be helpful in geneological
study,”

In the IFC last night they passed

/a motion which was introduced sev-
/eral weeks ago and tabled to allow
‘girls above the first floor of the fra-

ternity houses. A petition will be
drawn up and formally presented to

ithe Student Affairs Committee to al-
‘low this revision of the faculty regu-

lations.
The principle motive behind the

IFC's passage of this motion appeared

to be to restore the balance of upper-
classmen who actually live in the

| fraternity houses.

Dave Stovall introduced a motion
that would give the Rush Committee

| of the IFC wide discretion in schedul-

ing the smokers for next year’s prob-
rush system. Many professors

would not go on athletic trips if they
had to miss an important rushing
function. The committee would hope-
fully be able to avoid as many of

| the conflicts as possible.

Carter mentioned the “Stags” edi-
torial that appeared in last Friday's
Ring-tum Phi; he felt that this was
not much of a problem and that,
even so, the Judicial Board and the
IFC had little jurisdiction over this
matter. It was the consensus of the
IFC that no problem really existed in
this area,

A motion introduced by Jay Wetsel
to divide the faculty up among the
IFC members present to be talked
to in a public relations campaign was
defeated. The object of the campaign
was to try to give every faculty mem-
ber a chance to ask geustions about
the fraternity point of view. This
motion was defeated but Carter urged
every member of the IFC to try
to see as many professors as possible.

said that the program was going

EC meeting

The Executive Committee held a
rather uneventful meeting last night
in relevance to legislation, but in the
course of the evening brought to
light the possibility of the relaxation
of dormitory regulations concerning
women and the anticipated construc-
tion of lounges in the dormitories.

The first order of business was a
request by Judson Simmons, Secretary
of the EC, to purchase a tape-record-
er from a student for $100; this
machine will be used for the taping
of honor trials. It was cited by Sim-

 

mons that this recorder was of much |

greater quality than a newly bought

one of a slightly higher price. The mo- |

tion was seconded by Staman
Ogilvie and passed unanimously,

The highlight of the meeting was
the presentation of the report of the
Upper-Class Dorm Committee, head-
ed by freshman law
tom Gosse. He reported that upon
appointment he immediately contact-
ed Frank Parsons,
President, to discuss the possibility
of adding lounges to the upper-class
dorms.

Mr. Parsons then spoke to Dean
Atwood and President Huntley about
this matter and proceeded to have
blueprints drawn up and formal plans
made. Pour areas in the two dormi
tories are now being considered for
lounges, but final formulation of the
plans can not be done until the funds
are alloted and President Huniley
gives his final approval

The final consideration of the EC
was the Bitch-In planned for Mon
day, November 25, at 8:00 p.m. in
duPont Auditorium. Posters will be
placed about the campus later this
week and next Monday, announcing
the proposed meeting, and EC repre
sentatives will visit fraternity houses
on Monday to remind the student

IFC president Clark Carter ques-

Atwood replied that it would be in-

one-semester rush or rush after the
freshman year, but he continued, it
is entirely within the power of the
faculty to make such a decision.

Carrere said that the IFC must

cation with the faculty in regard to
the deferred rush proposal, and that
the IFC should not lose any op-
portunity to educate and talk to mem-
bers of the faculty concerning de-
ferred rush.

 

Sen. McGovern here for Contact

Charles Evers scheduled
with educator, journalist

At last night’s IFC meeting, Con-

tact chairman, Sam Hinkle, announc-
ed that four speakers including South
Dakota Senator George McGovern
have been scheduled for this year’s
symposium on power. The remaining
three speakers are John R, Silber,
Dean of Students at University of
Texas—Austin, Philippe Labro, a
French journalist, and Charles Evers,
brother of murdered Medgar Evers
and defeated candidate for Congress.

The Contact theme attempts to
analyze all forms of power including
political, student and black power.
Hinkle also said that he hoped to
obtain another speaker to talk on
man’s power over nature as in a
heart-transplant operation. He also
hoped to obtain another speaker to
summarize the whole program.

Hinkle also noted that he has talk-
ed to Troubadour director, Lee Kahn
in hopes of having a Troub play
based on a theme of power produced
that same week.

George McGovern was a candidate
for the Democrat presidential nomi-
nation this year. His generally dovish
position on Vietnam won him the
unofficial mantle as the “Kennedy
candidate.” McGovern, who has a
PhD from Northwestern University,
received his BA from Dakota Wes-
leyan University in 1946.

McGovern was elected to the Sen-
ate in 1963 after serving as director
of President Kennedy's Food for
Peace program. He first entered poli-
tics in 1955 when he was first elected
to the House of Representatives. He

Generals thrash Bears to close season

After some initial setbacks in the
first half, Washington and Lee rallied
strongly to defeat Washington U. 14-3
for the first time since 1961. The
Generals kept the visitors’ offense
bottled up all afternoon, and finally
won it on their own fine passing at-
tack. In one of his finest perform-
ances ever, Bucky Cunningham broke
one school record and tied another in
his final game on Wilson Field.

Cunningham hauled in six passes
Saturday to once again tie the rec-
ord for most catches in a season, 44.
He did manage to break the season
pass-catching yardage record, though.
He only needed some thirty-seven
yards to break the record of 493.
After a short pass did the trick in
the third quarter, Bucky put the
record under lock and key by taking
in a forty-five yard bomb in the end
zone. He ended up with 532 yards
for the season,

After threatening once in the first
quarter, the Bear's finally got onto
the scoreboard early in the second
period. A sustained drive had brought

finished with a 3-5-1 record. But
there is hope for next year:

The one exception to the dismal
overrall picture was the J.V. soccer
team. Playing a schedule of good
closely knit prep school teams, who
usually demolish the Brigadiers, they
ended up with five wins against only
two losses. Instrumental in their fine

| As the clock was running out in
the half, the Generals began to show
some life. With only thirty-two sec-
onds left, Drew Kumpuris intercepted
a Washington pass on their thirty,
and ran it back all the way to the
sixteen. On the first play from
scrimmage, Chuck Kuhn was trapped
behind the line, and just managed to
throw it away as he was going down.
Once again, on second down, the
Blue offensive line failed to hold, and
Kuhn was dumped on the twenty.
Fortunately the ball was centered for
a field goal try. Time remained for
one more TD attempt, though, so
Kuhn fired to Joe Dozier in the end

a variety of other offices throughout
the country. But the only vote we
|can cast for the top of the ticket is
la vote of no confidence.

 

It was an entirely different second
half. The Generals stifled the Bear's
attack with an effective pass rush,
and the offensive line not only pro-
tected Kuhn, but started clearing
holes for Dozier and Gossman. At
12:28 of the third quarter, the other
Kumpuris brother, Dean, interecepted
another pass on the Washington 40
and brought it down to their ten
on a runback which looked like it
might go all the way. It wasn’t neces-
sary. The first time Kuhn got the
ball, he fired a pass complete to
Steve Mahaffey in the corner of the
end zone.

Just minutes later, the Generals
held the Bears deep in their own
territory. The punt to Dave Brooks
was returned to the Washington
forty, and another score looked to
be in the offering. But on the first
offensive play, Kuhn’s pass was in-
tercepted and brought to the visitors’
forty-five. This was the best field
position the Bears had had in some
time, and a score by them might
have changed the complexion of the
game, but on first down, quarterback
Prentke bobbled the snap and John
Harris of W&L recovered.

Following his example of the last
two offensive series, Kuhn decided to
go for the TD right off. With plenty
of time in the pocket, he lofted a
high lazy pass to Bucky Cunningham
on the five who was more than seven
yards in front of his defender.
Baizley’s point after made it 14-3, the
final outcome.

From that time on, Washington
was powerless. Except for a short
lived drive in the fourth quarter they
never again made it out of their own
territory. With about two minutes to
play, Charlie Freret interecepted a
Bear pass on his own 31 and the
| Blue were able to stall out most of
| the rest of the clock.

Lee Students Study
Vast Subject Sphere

Robert E. Lee research grants have
been given to 42 students this year.
The grants-in-aid are awarded to stu-
dents who then work on a given
project under the supervision and
guidance of a member of the faculty.

These research projects are unique
to a great degree in that they are
often topics on the graduate level.
The projects may originate with the
student or with a faculty member
who wants a student assistant to help
in one of his research undertakings.

Ihe program was begun in 1960
through a gift of more than $250,000
from the late Dr. Gustavus Benz
Capito of Charleston, W. Va. Below

Alumnus Provides Income for WLUR

A freak broadcast signal that per-
mits an alumnus in Lynchburg to
hear Washington and Lee University’s
low power FM educational radio sta-
tion has been translated into an an-
nual gift of some $2,700 for support |
of the station's activities.

Richard E. Gooch, a 1930 gradu-
ate of the university and a former
Lynchburg radio broadcasting ex-
ecutive, has established an endow-
ment which will provide an annual
income of approximately $2,700 to
be applied to operating expenses and
equipment purchase for WLUR-FM.

A laboratory of the Department of
Journalism and Communications,
WLUR-FM broadcasts nightly except
Saturdays from 7 to 11 p.m. and on
Saturdays from 1 to 9 p.m. It began
operation in February, 1967.

Gooch says that WLUR’s signal

cock Auditorium. Immediately fol-

 

lowing the production there will be
a coffee hour during which the audi-
ence will have a chance to meet the!
director, Richard Busch, the designer, |
Dennis Dougherty, and the cast.

The Brechtian play is essentially a
modern parable, Set in the China of |
1940, “The Good Woman of Setzuan”
tells the story of Shen Te, a prostitute |
who befriends three gods and ends
their search for a good and happy
individual. Rewarded with enough

money to buy a tobacco store, she
must assume the identity of a hard-|
ened businessman to prevent her!

Alumnus

John W. Warner,
Washington, D. C., law firm of Hogan
and Hartson, has been elected to
membership on the Board of Trustees
of Washington and Lee University, it
was announced today by Dr. Huston
St. Clair, rector of the board.

Warner, 41, is a 1949 graduate of
WAL with a B.S. degree in physics-
engineering. He received his LL.B.
degree from the University of Vir-
ginia Law School in 1953.

Law Career Begun As Clerk

The University’s new trustee was
admitted to the Bar of the District
of Columbia in 1953, serving first
as law clerk to the Honorable E.
Barrett Prettyman, former chief judge
of the United States Circuit Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit, and then joining the law firm
of McKenny, Flanery and Craighill.

From 1955 to 1960, Warner was
an assistant U. S. Attorney for the
District of Columbia, serving in all
trial and appellate divisions of the
U. S. Attorney's Office, and conclud-

a partner in the

——*ing with two years in the Criminal

Division trial staff for the WU. S.
District Court.

Later in 1960, Warner joined
Hogan and Hartson as an associate
in the firm's banking-corporate de- |
partment. He became a general part-|
ner in 1964,

Throughout his legal career, Warn-
er has displayed active concern for
the plight of indigent criminal de-

fendants. During each year of private

sel for defendants unable
private counsel. During the civil dis-
orders occurring in the nation’s capi-
tal in April, 1968, Warner was among
attorneys who volunteered to assist
District of Columbia courts with the

“Prettyman Internship Program” at
Georgetown University, a pilot pro-
ject to provide qualified counsel for
indigent criminal defendants. Each

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

An Interview With President Huntley

(Editor’s note: The following contains
pertinant excerpts from a conversation with
President Huntley conducted this past
Tuesday night. The staff of the Friday
Ring-tum Phi wishes to thank President
Huntley for his time and patience so that
this interview could be made possible.)

Five-Day Plan

Ring-tum Phi; We've heard that one of the
critics of the Five-Day Plan, Mike Nation,
has said that the Lynchburg Plan would re-
inforce student apathy prevalent here. This
apathy has been subject to some criticism for
some time. And although it does appear that
the situation is improving, do you feel that
the Lynchburg Plan would reinforce the
apathetic attitude, if you feel that one exists?

President Huntley: I don’t see any particular
reason why a class scheduling plan would have
much effect on apathy one way or the other.
I suppose it’s possible that any Five-Day Plan
would seem to some to de-emphasize the re-
sponsibility of students on the campus. To
that extent, if students take it in that light,
then I suppose I might. I hope that’s not the
way it’s intended. I know that the faculty
members that favor it don’t look at it that

way.

I would judge that there are two apparent
reasons why the faculty favors the plan. The
first and obvious one is the convenience of
having a long weekend. People also feel that
for some students and some faculty members
a more condensed class schedule would permit

outside of social

time for activities

activities on Saturday. Whether it would work

some

that way or not, I don’t know.

Those that oppose the five day week feel
that Friday will become Saturday; if we're
on a Five-Day Week, we'll then be on a four-
day week. But, I don’t believe that will hap-
pen.

R-t Phi: What are the chances that the faculty
will act on Monday to approve any Five-Day

Plan?

Huntley: I really don’t know. The faculty
here is composed of men who have many
different habits of thoughts, as they should.
Not all of them have been in a position to
consider the issue until it is upon them. It’s
hard to predict.

R-t Phi: If the faculty should approve a Five-
Day Plan, do you think we would have the
plan in effect next semester?

Huntley: They'd have to vote on that, too
but I think that it would be a good possibility.

Apathy

R-t Phi: Ac the beginning of the interview,
we hit on the subject of student apathy.
What are your thoughts on this? What do
you think it’s sources are; do you think it’s
a trait common to all campuses; and do you

see any cure-all for it?

Huntley: I don’t know what it’s causes are. I
suspect it is common to all campuses. It pro-
duces a division within the student body be-

tween the students who are hyper-active, and

 

 

om couldn't cate less le would
end in the position or responsibility
ie sttidents wit OoVver-active thyroids ar
ething lt sPriiic to fi that iti Wat a little

different when I was a student. The young
generation is more introspective than it once
was. They also seem to lack a sense of humor;
by that I mean they don’t have the ability to
laugh at themselves with wry detachment.

It could be that we’re experiencing the
effects of a public and private educational
system, that puts young men only with their
own age groups. I don’t know what one does
about that—TI think that is a generation gap
that produces isolation of the individual from
society. Even I am more isolated from 40 year
olds than I used to be. I really don’t know
what the answer is.

Smaller Classes

R-t Phi: What can be done to get the student
more involved in the classroom here to avoid
this apathy?

Huntley: I think that we need to look at
continuously the advantage of our smallness.

 

I suspect that many faculty members do try to
involve the students in their material in every

dental to other plans. We need first to de-
what academic facilities we need.
Incident to that decision, a projection would
need to be made of the size of the student
body over the next ten years. A tentative
master plan as to academic construction will
hopefully be with us before this school year
is out. Then, it will be possible to make a
decision as to where a set of dorms could be
located.

termine

I think that we will have additional upper-
class housing. I hope that we will have them
soon. I think that probably the first dorms
will be built without the decision having been
made as to how many will ultimately be
constructed,

As to what kind of dorms they will be, I
don’t know. I do know that they will be built
as an alternative to living in apartments or
single rooms in town. I’m not really sure
what that means, though. Our goal would not
be to duplicate what is already offered a stu-
dent in town, but to offer an additional al-
ternative to it. I don’t know what's implied
in all that-——whether it means that unlimited
restrictions of female visitation and drinking
should be allowed, or whether it means that
students themselves in each unit should de-
termine that. I’m not sure. I’m sure it would
mean considerably fewer restrictions than one
now has in the dormitories. We certainly don’t
want to offer just a better appointed apart-
ment. I don’t believe that penning up all the
students in dormitories is ncessarily going to
produce a better academic climate.

One of the purposes in having the dormi-
tories would be to offer an alternative to
fraternity social life, which wouldn’t neces-
sasarily mean that you'd have to choose one
or the other. I don’t think that the school
either could or should attempt to create a
school-run fraternity system. The school
should take affirmative steps to reduce a fra-

 

way that 1s possibl . Administratively we

t
should try to provide them with more

Curriculum

R-t Phi: As for academics, could we interpret
the effort on the part of the Curriculum Com.
mittee to come up with a new alteration in
the curriculum as a change of philosophy in
education?

Huntley: I think that you could take it as
an effort on the faculty’s part to take ad-
vantage of the small nature of the school—
the good student-faculty ratio—to adopt pro-
grams that are well suited to our situation.
I think you should be cautious not to assume
that there is some highly efficient scheme,
though. The Committee is operating on the
philosophy that they themselves have de-
veloped. They are trying to ensure that the
curriculum we offer is the best possible one
we can offer in our circumstances. It will tend
to offer as diverse a program as we can afford.

Board of Trustees

R-t Phi: In last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi, an
editorial called for a student to sit on the
Board of Trustees as a representative of the
student body. What are your feelings on
this?

Huntley: I think that it’s better not to con-
sult them at all if you're trying to fool them
into thinking that you're consulting them.
But I’m inclined to think that student mem-
bership on the Board would not be a good
idea. I think you would inhibit the Board
of Trustees, rather than nimble their deci-
sions. I also think

Gap Lies Between Students and EC

According to many experts, one of the
reasons for the recent unrest at colleges and
universities throughout the country has been
the lack of communication between students
and administration.

The students see the administrations and
their spokesmen, the Presidents of the uni-
versities, as solely interested in raising funds
for the schools. The students also contend
that no one in the administration is willing to
take time out to hear their demands, suggest-
ions and gripes. Thus, when the students
cannot be heard through the proper channels,
they must resort to demonstrations, which
may often get out of hand.

As evidenced by today’s interview with
President Robert Huntley, this problem does
not exist at Washington and Lee to as great
an extent as it may at other universities. The
administration is willing to talk with the stu-
dents. Indeed, the administration often goes
out of its way to talk to students. Although
action is not taken on a lot of issues the stu-
dents bring up, there is a direct line of com-
munication between the two factions.

Where a direct line of communication is
lacking here is not between the students and
administration, but between the students and
their Executive Committee. The student body
at W&L has always complained about the pro-
cedings of the EC. The students have charged
the EC with dealing clandestinely in all mat-
ters, especially those concerning the honor
system.

If students have been complaining why
have they not gone directly to the EC and
given constructive criticism and logical solu-
tions to their gripes? The excuse used most
often is the EC won’t listen to them.

This may have been the situation in the
past, but this year Student Body president
Jay Passavant is trying to correct what has
turned into widespread apathy on the part
of the students because of the fear and frustra-
tion of not being heard. One of his solutions,
which does not claim to be a panacea, is the
“Bitch-In” scheduled for Monday night in
duPont Hall.

This is a chance for students to air in the
open their complaints and gripes concerning
the EC or any other segment of the Univer-
sity. At the same time it is an opportunity for
students to present constructive suggestions.
All too often we, as students, are prone to
complaining about things without bothering
to resolve solutions for them.

The EC intends to listen to all contribu-
tions of students. No members of the faculty
or administration will be recognized to speak.
This is the time for students to again become
part of their government and bridge the gap
which has arisen between these two groups.
For anyone who does not attend the “Bitch-
In” without a valid excuse and still complains
about the decisions of the EC, all we can say

 

is, “You had your chance to be heard.”

Publications Board Statement

In view of the editorial entitled, “Quo
vadit honor,” published in the Tuesday, No-
vember 19, 1968 Ring-tum Phi, the Publica-
tions Board feels that it is necessary to issue
a statement.

As the editorial states, the Publications
Board met on Tuesday, November 4, 1968
to consider what action, if any, to take con-
cerning a charge of alleged plagiarism in an
editorial written by Neil Kessler in the October
25, 1968 edition of the Friday Ring-tum
Phi. During the meeting, by unanimous con-
sent, it was “agreed that the proceedings of
the meeting would be kept secret”’ (accord-
ing to Secretary Larry Honig’s minutes). This
decision was reached on the basis of precedent
involving censorship rulings by the Publica-
tions Board. It is regrettable that this con-
fidence has been violated by Mr. Honig.
Since this information has been revealed in
part, the Publications Board has voted to re-
lease a more complete account of the meet-
ing in order to protect our integrity and cor-
rect a misrepresentation of the facts. It is
true that, as Mr. Honig says, “the Publica-
tions Board failed to remove Mr. Kessler as
editor.” It is mot true, as Mr. Honig implies
by omission, that the Publications Board did
nothing. The board passed the following two
motions of censure:

“The Publications Board finds that Mr.
Kessler has acted unethically.”

“The Publications Board finds that its con-
fidence in Mr. Kessler’s judgment has been
shaken, and asks him to continue as Editor-
in-Chief of The Friday Ring-tum Phi, but
that the editorship is provisional until the

end of the first semester, subject to review
by the Board.”

Dean Edward C. Atwood was informed of
these two motions. The board rejected a mo-
tion that Mr. Kessler be removed as editor.

Mr. Honig has also implied that Mr.
Kessler lied during the course of his testimony
before the Publications Board. In view of the
fact that no officially authorized transcript of
that testimony exists, and that there are vary-
ing opinions among the board members con-
cerning that testimony, it is difficult to see
how Mr. Honig can make such a statement

of fact.
oo.

In a meeting of the Publications Board on
Thursday, November 21, 1968, the board
censured Mr. Honig and voted to make pub-
lic this censure, which reads,

“Mr. Honig has published charges against
Mr. Kessler which were previously brought
before the proper governing bodies and
considered by those bodies in the strictest
confidence. Moreover, by omission of the
above mentioned details, he has misrepre-
sented these facts. Mr. Honig has charged
that Mr. Kessler ‘changed his testimony’
before the Publications Board, of which
charge he had previously been acquitted by
due process. In making these charges, Mr.
Honig has been guilty of irresponsible and
unethical journalism. The Publications
Board condemns his actions and warns Mr.
Honig against further irresponsible acts.”

A Look In Review of Fall Sports

With The Intramurals

Although Thursday was to be a
conclusive day in intramurals, the
only conclusions reached were in|

swimming.

In football the long delayed champ-
ionship was further postponed, as Phi
Delta Theta maintaned their jinx over
Phi Gamma Delta. The Phi Gams,
needing only one more win to
the crown, fell to a second half
claught of Phi Delt scores, 13-12.

Phi Gam jumped off to a 6-0 lead
with a touchdown on their first
offensive series. A bomb to Tom
Robinson from Gil Turner was fol-
lowed by a blocked extra point at-
tempt. This was all of the first half
scoring, but the Phi Delta came back
strong at the beginning of the second
period.

Sparked by the passing of Casey
Jones to receivers Gary Murphy and
Clint Murchison, The winners scored
two quick ones, both set up on inter-

ice
on-

 

ceptions. The deciding factor turned
out to be a conversion by Dave Huff-|
man of the Phi Delts. It was decisive |
because the Fijis moved to a_ last]
second tally, again on a long pass
from Turner to Robinson. With time |

The question is, Is any effort at
all to increase interest in student
government worth the effort? For
some hints, consider last night's Bitch-
In:

The project depends on students
attending, armed with ideas. Only
fifty showed up last night, and they
all looked unhappy. Less than half
had anything to say. How does this
impress the E.C.? The Bitch-In_ en-
courages E.C. members who think
they operate in a government vacuum,

The project also depends on E.C.
interest and participation. Only four
members plus the president came (the
meeting was taped). Men like Pete
Hendricks, articulate and competent,

who spoke contemptuously and smirk-
ed when he wasn’t talking. The Bitch-
In encourages students who think the
E.C. is hopeless.

The project succeeds through open

and honest communication. Its format | ©

Enlarging upon an earlier work,
Dr. Allen W. Moger has written a
study of Virginia history entitled
“Virgnia: Bourbonism to Byrd, 1870-
1925." The book will be published
by the University Press of Virginia.

Mrs. Betty Munger, manager of the
WAL Bookstore, has scheduled a re-
ception and autograph party for Dr.
Moger on the publication date, Dec.
11. Invitations have been sent to pro-
fessors at W&L and nearby colleges.
The party will be from 4:00 to 5:30
p.m. at the Bookstore.

In 1940 Dr. Moger published his
doctoral dissertation “Rebuilding of
the Old Dominion, 1880-1902." He
explained, “A few years ago | began
expanding it backward and forward
to cover a longer period in history.”
His new book examines Virginia his-

above the second floor of fraternities.

The SAC had three major reserva-
tions. First they objected to the lack
of regulations governing when and
under what circumstances girls would
be allowed above the first floor. Sec-
ondly, they were concerned because
there were no adequate facilities
above the first floor for the girls.
And thirdly, they wanted concrete
assurances that the changing of the
regulation would bring more upper-
classmen into the houses.

The IFC felt that girls should be
required to leave the second and
third floors at the same time that
they were required to leave the house
itself at either 2 or 3 a.m. Carter
stated that creating lounges on each
floor would be the best way to face
the problem of the lack of facilities
on the upper floors.

In further action junior justice Bob

instead of the 2 a.m. rule for some
of the weekends. He said that girls
are usually required to be out of
the fraternity houses by 2 a.m. and
not required to be at their hostesses
until 3 am. and that this put an
unfair burden on those who had no-
where to go after 2 am, The IFC

is left open. He urged that the houses

EC complaint session
scores student rights

In last night’s Executive Commit-
tee sponsored Bitch-In the prevalent
theme of all the questions and com-
ments from the students attending
were focused on protecting the stu-
dent from any arbitrary action by
the Executive Committee. President
Jay Passavant also flatly stated that
the EC had no intention to review
any of the recent decisions of the
Publications Board.

All who participated seemed to be
concerned with any potential arbi-
trary action of the EC against the
rights of the students. Topics dis-
cussed included the potential danger
of the EC executive session, codi-
fication of the honor system, rights
of an accused honor system violator
before his public trial, and the pro-
tection of the student against un-
reasonable search by either the Uni-
versity authorities or the EC.

The total students who attended
the much-publicized Bitch-In numb-
ered only about 50, while only five
member of the EC were present in-
cluding President Jay Passavant, Vice-

sentatives Pete Hendricks, Joe Tomp-
kins, and Staman Ogilvie.

The first topic discussed involved
the hypothetical danger of the Ex-
ecutive Committee going into closed
session to iron out any major dif-
ferences in a pending piece of legisla-
tion where the student body was
unable to watch the process. The
members of the EC present replied
that the executive session was used
only for matters involving individuals
in the student body and other de-
cisions which should not go into the
Ring-tum Phi such as the selection
of Who's Who and the Gilliam

The honor system came under ex-
treme criticism, One student said that,
for him, the honor system was much
too vague. Since one professor's con-
cept of honor may be much different
from another's, he felt that this
placed the individual student in the
midst of five or more conflicting
interpretations of honor. He felt that
the only plausible solution was to
write out a concrete code of regula-
tions as to what would be considered
an honor violation.

Passavant replied that there were
undoubtedly areas in which the honor

Barrett’s bequest
builds the library
for Law School

The Law School has recently re-
ceived $128,309 from the estate of
the late Jasper J. Barrett. Barrett
was a 1910 gaduate of the W&L
Law School. President Huntley said
that the University will use the be-
quest to establish and maintain with-
in the Law School library a special
collection dealing with probate law,
trusts, estate planning, taxation, and
related subjects.

The special collection will bear the
designation, “Donated by Jasper J.
Barrett, LL.B. 1910 and his wife,
Hazel Barrett.” Any remaining portion
of the bequest not required for
library purposes will be used to estab-
lish one or more scholarships for de-

Sears-Roebuck Foundation
gives $1,500 to W@L

Sears - Roebuck Foundation has
given WAL a $1,500 grant which was
contributed under the foundation's
continuing program of financial aid
to privately supported colleges and
universities.

WAL was one of 12 colleges in
Virginia to receive aid from Sears-
Roebuck. By the end of 1968, more
than 700 educational — institutions
throughout the country will have re-
ceived grants from the foundation.

The money will be probably used
in some area of institutional support
not yet decided.

The Director of University Devel-
opment, Mr. Farris P. Hotchkiss, ex-
plained that neither of the grants
received in the last week were re-
quested by the school, but instead
they were given by the foundations
on the basis of WAL's “excellence in
depth” in scholastic activities. Also
he said that the consecutive contri-
butions made by the foundations
show a continuing confidence in the

Bitching

as the unneccessary carryings-on about Executive Sessions and
the searching of student quarters for drugs, allegedly Uni-

But the overall result was,

role in determining the nature of possible violations; pros and

cons of the penalty of absolute
matters relating to integration.

(and encourage), on a large scale, significant dialogue between
the students and their twelve governors. Congratulations are

in order for his success.

Carter sees need
for conglomerate calendar

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

The institution of the midweek
road-trip to a surrounding girls’ school
seems to be a regular part of a
WAL student's social life.

While many such trips afe un-
premeditated flings, an equal num-
ber are planned to a certain extent.
But unfortunately, whether they are
planned or not, the majority of these
trips lack any real direction once the

student finds himself at the girls’
school. Usually the date begins with
the question, “Well, I don't know.

What do you want to do?”

With a glance at such a calendar a
student could see what opportunities

are available on other campuses such
as plays, concerts, and lectures.

If something on the conglomerate
calendar appealed to a student, he
could plan a road trip which would
combine the pleasure of a date with
an event having cultural value, rather
than the normal exodus from the
schools to the “boondocks” or cheap
beer joints. Since most of these events
welcome all students at no cost, the
inexpensiveness of the date is also
attractive.

CHANGE
T

~

disc unit

By MACK WOODWARD
Assistant Bditorial-Page Editor

After struggling all of this month
to change from the old 1620 IBM
computer to the 1130, the computer
staff is nearing the end of its task.
Soon the third-generation computer
will be in full operation.

The major problem
by the staff, according
was the revision in the programming
system. Specifically, the programming
done for the administrative offices
has created a problem in the code
used by the new computer. The 1620
had all of the administration's data
in the SPS code; the change to the
1130 requires the change to the new-
er code known as Fortran.

Most of this conversion has been
done by the computer staff, who
divided the work among themselves;
both Mr. Dudley and Dr. Wise have
done quite a bit of the work. By the
end of this week, the 1620 will have
been phased out of all the immediate
work with which it is concerned;
however, programming of the sec-
tioning will continue for two months,
at least, and possibly into next
semester.

The basic advantage of the 1130
is its ability to retain knowledge in a
memory bank. The 1620 was able to
program and process given material,
but the 1130 will be able to recall
stored material. It was for this reason
that the computer staff became inter-
ested in acquiring the 1130 for the
school.

encountered
to Dr. Wise,

x As the 1130 is basically different

from the 1620, it has caused a
change in the computer programming
classes. The classes, after having
studied the 1620 for some time this
fall, had to center their attention on
the 1130, a more complex third-gen-
eration computer.

The introduction of the 1130 com-
puter into the computer system will
facilitate processing of material for
all of the departments that make use
of the computer. The computer will
be able to do work more efficiently
than the old 1620, which required
time on the operator’s part to pro-
gram the data for the computer each
time it was used. The new computer,
with its recall abilities, will be able
to cut down on the time used not
only by the operator, but also by the
computer.

One of the major differences in the
two computers is the cost involved
in the new computer. The 1130 will
probably cost the University about
fifty per cent more than did the 1620.
This computer, however, will com-
pensate for the additional cost in the
greater amount of work done and
in the time it saves the programmers.
The specific figures have not yet been
released, but the fifty per cent mark
is conceded to be a general figure by
Dr. Wise.

As soon as the 1620 computer ts
phased out, it will no longer be need-
ed or used by the University. The
1130 will completely take over all
of the tasks that the 1620 performed.

The 1130 was first used early in

Since the company is still in its

infancy, it is undertaking a massive

Ball & Brumback lead strong swimmers

By Reeve Kelsey and Roy Carlton

The W&L swimming team recently
concluded its pre-season conditioning
with an informal scrimmage against
VMI in VMI's 25 yard pool. Re-
turning, after Thanksgiving, the team
has four meets including two of its
toughest opponnets American and
Catholic Universities. The American
meet, in Lexington, is Saturday, De-
cember 6 with another meet the next
Monday against Roanoke College al-
so in Lexington.

 

Among Coach Stearns’s problems
include finding the way to maximize
the talents of Billy Ball, Bill Brum-
back, and freshman John Lawlor as
well as trying to plug the gap in
the breaststroke events left by graduat-
ing co-captain Pat Costello.

The Generals’ strongest point could
easily be their freestylers. Brumback
and co-captain Ross Forman have
proved to be a deadly combination in
the freestyle sprints. In the 200 yard
freestyle event, Lawlor and Hal Catlin

 

Grapplers plagued by lack of depth

Depth, or rather the lack of it,
may be the key to this year’s varsity
wrestling team. A bumper crop of
outstanding freshman have come up
to compete for varsity roles, but they
only just fill some gaping holes made
by graduation in a squad that was
thin last year,

Again this season, the Generals
can count on several stellar per-
formers. Co-captains Razz Rasberry
at 130 and Jay Clarke at 167 are the
most dependable wrestlers around.
Then there’s hulking Dan Webster at

 

Booters Suffer
Losing Season

Although Washington and Lee's
soccer team suffered its first losing
season since 1961, Coach Joe Lyles
looks optimistically to the future.

Coach Lyles expects soccer to re-
sume its winning ways next year
under newly-elected captains Doug
Clarke, a rising senior fullback from
Houston, Tex., and lineman John
Yow, a senior from Marietta, Ga.

Coach Lyles says lack of depth was
a major factor in the Generals’ 3-5-1
season just completed. This, together
with the midseason loss of co-captain
and all-state forward Scott Fechnay
with a case of pneumonia, and a lack
of young talent hurt the squad's per-
formance.

177 who nearly made a legend out of
himself last year as a_ freshman.
Other grapplers back from last year’s
varsity are Dave Higgins and Charlie
Ross at 160 and Jack Ross and Brent
Hankins at 152. One of the biggest
mysteries is the heavyweight slot
where Waugh Crigler wrestled last
year. A bad shoulder has made
Waugh’'s situation uncertain.

To fill the gaping holes left in the
lower weights, Coach Miller is de-
pending on several freshmen. Buzz
White at 123 and Steve Ory at 116
are set. The big fights will shape up
for berths at 137 and 145, Sopho-
mores Wes Pullman, Dee Galanides
and Bruce Hankins are vying for the
former, while Bill West, John Clore,
and Roy Carlton aim for 145, Han-
kins and West look like the best bets.

Should injuries hit as hard as last
year, the Blue will find themselves in
deep trouble. Clark Carter is varsity
quality and could break in at 167 or
177. Jim Hooker, a freshman, may
claim the heavyweight slot, but other
than that the Generals are paper
thin.

will provide more than adequate
depth. In distance freestyle events
David Kympton and Lawlor will both
score well.

Kympton and Lawlor are also the
two leading candidates at the moment
for the 200 yard butterfly event. In
the backstroke, perhaps co-captain
Billy Ball’s strongest stroke, Ball will
be supported by Hal Catlin and Bill
Kimmel. The breastroke is still a
major question mark. Freshman Kline
Stuart is a strong swimmer in this
category with support from Joe
Philips and Scot McElroy. Both Ball
and Lawlor are proficient at this
stroke but they are more valuable
elsewhere.

Leading the Generals’ diving attack
will be sophomore Mike Carrere with
several candidates still battling it out
for the second diving position.

The tentative addition of West Vir-
ginia University and Penn State will
add a bit of glamour to the natators’
schedule. The Generals barely beat
West Virginia last year in Lexington
in what was one of the most exciting
swimming meets of the year.

Besides Lawlor and Stuart there are

many strong swimmers among the
freshmen that will add considerable
depth to the overall attack. They in-
clude Rick Sands in the freestyle,
Bert Meem in the freestyle and but-
terfly, Withers Davis, and Charles
Comly.

By ROY CARLTON

It’s only six more days till the
Generals begin their 1968-69 basket-
ball season, and at this point, despite
the roughest schedule since major
college status, they look like they're
headed toward another winning year.
Monday night, Randolph-Macon
comes to old Doremus to initiate
things, but don’t expect any cake-
walk. W&L has never beaten the
Yellow Jackets in basketball, not
even in the last two years. R-MC
took two from the Blue a couple of
seasons ago, and avoided a match-up
last year when Lycoming belted the
Generals in the Randolph-Macon
tournament.

Coach Canfield’s squad has good
prospects of changing all that this
year, though. On the plus side for the
Blue is a twenty-three game home
winning streak, and a veteran squad
loaded with promising rookies. The
Generals will probably start with
All-Staters Mike Neer and Mel Cart-

«wright at center and forward re-
spectively. Last year’s “sixth starter,”
Stu Fauber, will move into the other
forward slot with Norwood Morrison
and Charlie Stone at the guards. Cap-
tain Earl Edwards will alternate with
Neer.

The Yellow Jackets can be counted
on to pit another fine team against
the Generals when the two collide
next week. Randy-Mac was very
tough last year and this season they
return with five lettermen from last
year and a couple talented freshmen
to add some depth. Their field gen-
eral, Darrell Morris, is a senior guard
who averaged 16.2 points per game
at that position in the last campaign.
Bolstering him are forwards Charlie
Weston, 6-5, and Craig Barney, 6-6.
Their combined height may be able
to cause some trouble for the Blue
whose tallest forward is Cartwright
at 6-5,

Other returnees are sophomores
Dale Kurowsky and Jim Phelps. Those
five will probably be the nucleus of
the Yellow Jacket squad. But R-MC
has a couple of very talented fresh-
men on the varsity in the persons
of Floyd Wingfield and Frank Farren.
It's to be expected, though, that as
freshmen, they won't be too effective
until later in the season.

Not that that’s a Godsend for the

Blue either. The same thing applies
to W&L, which is carrying five fresh-
men on the varsity at present. They
seem to be progressing very well,
however, as evidenced by last week’s
scrimmage against Bluefield (W.Va.)
State. W&L’s five freshmen; Robbie
Faust, Dave Stone, John Glace, Scott
Wood and Mike Daniel; went in
against Bluefield’s second string in a
“third” half. Their rout of the visitors
was so complete that Bluefield fin-
ally had to send in its first string to
even things up.

Last Thursday's scrimmage was cer-
tainly a boost for the roundballers.
Bluefield is supposed to have a really
fine team this year, but the Generals
had things completely their way.
Mike Neer rebounded well, and the

ball inside to Cartwright. One thing
the Blue needed last year and will
need even more this years is outside
shooting. The loss of Mal Wesselink,
6-7, removes a good deal of talent
from under the boards, and the only
way it can be compensated is by hit-

ting more often from the outside.
This was perhaps the most encourag-
ing thing about the Bluefield scrim-
mage. Morrison, Charlie Stone, and
Bill Rhyne were all superb on the
long shots as well as working the ball
around. If these three can continue
to give comparable performances,
then the Generals may finally have
the more balanced offense they've
been needing.

WAL appears to be ready for the
Yellow Jackets come Monday night.
But Randy-Mac is always ready for
the Generals. It's about time they
were put in their place, and_ this
year’s Blue may just do the trick.

  

It should be a game well worth
watching.

facilities, such as placement offices,
to aid the distribution of the ques-
tionnaires. Moreover, Compujob_ is
taking every precaution not to over-
look small colleges.

In the past great cost has tended
to limit industry in sending recruit-
ing representatives to many small
colleges where students urgently need
the wide exposure Compujob now
offers.

Questionnaires are located on the
WAL campus in the various academic
buildings, the Library, and the Co-op.
Compujob's on-campus representative
is senior Jeff Wexler, who has ad-
ditional questionnaires.

In its files Compujob already has
information regarding about 50 per
cent of those graduating students who
plan to enter the labor market in
1969. The company hopes to signi-
ficantly increase this figure by the
end of the year.

In its efforts to reach students and
make them aware of its operations,
Compujob has enlisted the aid of
collegiate newspapers and other pub-
lications both on campuses already in
the program and on campuses not
yet using Compujob. Through this
publicity Compujob hopes that in-
terested students will participate in the
business.

system could be clarified, but that
there is a distinct difference between
an enforceable set of regulations and
the concept of personal honor. He
cited several cases last spring where
the different professors in the mathe-
matics department were applying dif-
ferent criterions to the honor system,
and the EC had discussed the prob-
lem with them to devise a consistent
application of the honor system in
that department. He felt that the
honor system should not evoke into
a set of enforceable rules.

Another problem discussed was the

violator after
guilty and before a
trial. The EC now
person as guilty and forbids him to
go to classes. Passavant said that this
was based entirely upon precedent.
Many felt that as soon as a student
opted for a public hearing he should
be considered innocent and be al-
lowed to go to classes until he is
tried again.

The questions involved in the un-
authorized search of a student's pri-
vate room were also raised. It was
noted that in cases of possession of
illegal drugs, the University had
searched without either warrant or
the permission of the student involv-
ed. Passavant stated that the EC “has
never hesitated in the past” to search

been found
public

ja student’s room seeking evidence for

an honor violation. The participants
in the discussion felt that what was
needed was a student civil-liberties
code.

Passavant also urged that due to
the manpower shortage and the
amount of work that the EC must
do limits the EC’s ability to hold
lengthy independent investigations.
He said that he would be very will-
ing to form a committee made up
of one EC member and _ interested
students to investigate a given prob-
lem and make a report back to the
EC.

The EC was also severly critized
for its vote on the resolution not to
compile a list of those women in Lex-
ington who were willing to house
Negro girls.

meetings. If he controls discussion,
he appears to be censoring it.

With all this, did the Bitch-In ac-
complish anything? It certainly un-
covered some sore spots, like the
E.C.’s apparently unlimited right to
search any student’s private belong-
ings at any time. It also made pos-
sible some clarification in E.C. pro-
cedure.

Mostly, though, the Bitch-In de-
monstrated a failure. The E.C. tried
to use it as a dramatic device, a
stunt, an eye-catching device to en-
courage activity. All it dramatized
was something so dull and ordinary
that we all know it: student bodies
get the leaders they deserve, and we
have ours.

None of the matters brought up
last night would be allowed to exist
even briefly if we cared enough to
notice them. The E.C. would be
anxious to explain itself if people
showed they listen. As it is, some
good people on the E.C. confront
some issues in the face of our apathy,
the real issue. We always knew that.

Proof of the desperation over this
situation surfaced when a participant
suggested there might be more ses-
sions, even bi-monthly ones, a sort
of Son of Bitch-In. Groans filled the
echoing, nearly-empty auditorium.
This sort of thing may begin to have
an effect on Passavant, who has been
trying valiantly to cause some mo-
mentum among students.

If a Bitch-In is not ideal, what are
the alternatives? The first thing must

be to recognize that the lanes of
communication are, not closed, but
unused. We have no right to complain
about the E.C. without complaining
first to it. One-time talking won't
work, cither. Last night Passavant
almost literally begged students in-
terested in specific issues to work
on them with the E.C. The same
thing holds true during elections;
after all, we choose these people.

Direct questions help. If asked
through the Ring-tum Phi, they might
receive direct answers even without
a Bitch-In. Without any questions at
all, the E.C, will do what it wants.
The Bitch-In demonstrated how much
of a vacuum does surround the E.C.
If the meeting has serious flaws in
itself, it still points out whose effort
is needed to accomplish what we
want: our own,

make a decision on buying it “some-
time after Christmas.”

If the library does decide to buy a
reader-printer, it will probably be a
coin operated model. Mr. Needham
explained that a small charge, prob-
ably a quarter, would be required
to make a copy of the microfilm. No
charge would be imposed on_ the
reader part of the operation.

The machine makes negative prints,
since the library used positive micro-
film. However, Mr. Needham states
that the library may buy negative
microfilm from the 3M Corporation
for future use.

The library now has microfilm
copies of the New York Times from
1930, the Current Digest of the
Soviet Press for the past 10 years, and
various archives, among other ma-
terial. There are also two microfilm |
readers now in service. Besides hav-
ing the advantage of being able to|
print microfilm material, “the quality
of reproduction on the reader-printer
is very much better,” Mr. Needham |
adds. |

 

Special Law Election Scheduled

fed in the two plans presented to the

Pledging

For First

In a Monday night meeting, the |
faculty seemingly reversed its previ-

ous stand on fraternity rush by re-|
jecting three motions asking for de-
ferred rush beginning next year. The |

action was the culmination of debate |
on this issue which dates back to)
November 7, 1966. (See editorial on
Page 2.)

The first motion considered by the
faculty at the meeting pertained to
delaying fraternity rush until after
the freshman year. After much dis-
cussion and debate, it was voted
down.

After further discussion, a motion
to approve the Interfraternity Coun-
cil’s Plan Two was also defeated.
This plan was the one which had
been recommended by the faculty's
executive committee and favored by
the IFC, Plan Two deferred pledging
until mid-semester on a_ three-year-
trial basis with an inactive pledge
period until the second semester. A
1.5 average would have been re-
quired for both inactive and active
pledging while a 2.0 average was
required for initation. Under this plan

’

the IFC felt that financial losses of
the fraternities would have been re-
duced by more than $1000,

The third motion declined by the

faculty asked for fraternity rush to|—

be deferred until after the first |
semester of the freshman year. This
corresponded with IFC Plan One. A
1.5 average would have been requir-
ed for a freshman to become
pledge.

With all of the proposed deferred
rush will be retained. With this under-
standing in mind, the following
resolution was approved by the fac-
ulty:

“It is the sense of the faculty
that the Interfraternity Council give
close attention to ways to eliminate
pledging activities throughout the
first semester.”

The above resolution was contain-

d

faculty by the IFC.
The whole action of deferred fra-
ternity rush began ot the November

Deferred

Semester

15, 1966, when the faculty passed an
almost-unanimous resolution which
read:

“Resolved; That the faculty ex-
press to the Interfraternity Coun-
cil its opinion that a program of
deferred rush (delayed pledging)
would benefit the Univeristy edu-
cationally and fraternally.”

At a May I, 1967 faculty meeting
the faculty voted 43-28 to require
the IFC to implement deferred rush
for September of 1968. The partial
text of the faculty resolution was
follows:

as

“Since this faculty prefers that
deferred rush come about by stu-
dent action rather than by faculty
edict the IFC is requested to pre-
sent to the faculty for approval
not later than November 1, 1967,
a plan of deferred rush to become
effective for the school year 1968-
69. An acceptable plan would in-
corporate one of the following pro-
grams: deferred until the end of
the first semester, or deferred until
the end of the Freshman year.”

At the October 2, 1967 faculty
meeting the faculty postponed the

deadline for deferred rush until the
1969-70 session.

IFC | Wins Battle, But...

Monday night’s action by the faculty which kept fraternity
rush in its present state is very perplexing to us. We believe
it may even be perplexing to the faculty. Many of them prob-
ably walked out of the meeting trying to figure out what had
just happened. However, one thing is clear: the question of
deferred rush is not closed.

The faculty’s action Monday night does not preclude
any action in the future. We speculate that debate on this issue
will never really subside and will be brought up again and
again at faculty meetings until it is changed.

There are several reasons for this. First, we have learned
that the votes taken on the deferred rush motions, especially
that which asked for deferral of rush until mid-semester, were
close. In addition, there was not full attendance at the meet-
ing. If those not in attendance were to have voted, the faculty
decision might easily have been reversed.

Secondly, the argument that it is bad to expose freshmen
to the social life of the university before they enter the class-
room will always come to the forefront. There are some faculty
members who feel that there would be more anxiety on the
part of the freshmen if they went through a deferred rush
rather than if they rushed immediately. In the latter case, the
freshmen would just be anxious during the first week of
classes. Of course, students would not even have to go through
this if they were assured that everyone could join a fraternity
or if they were guaranteed practical alternatives to fraternities
(i.e., a student union, mixers with girls’ schools and dormitories
with facilities allowing students to entertain their dates).

Third, the record shows that the grades of this year’s
freshmen through mid-semester are lower than in the past.
Members of the faculty will always be haunted with the fact
that pledging contributes to low grades. If the Interfraternity
Council accepts the faculty resolution to eliminate first semester
pledge activities (which should be done immediately), it will
have to enforce this rule strictly. It will have to do a much
better job than it did last year when pledging activities went
on despite the IFC’s outlawing them through mid-semester.

Fourth, members of the faculty may have a change of
heart. We can only guess their motives for voting the way
they did. Some of the reasons we have heard can easily be
altered if fraternities do anything which disturbs them. Any
wrong step taken by any fraternity during rush or during
the school year will come under the scrutiny of the faculty and
is likely to change everything.

What we are trying to do by relating these speculations is
to show the IFC it is walking on thin ice. The IFC may have
won a battle but its position is tenuous. We strongly recom-
mend that the IFC continue to formulate plans for an effective
deferred rush. The IFC may feel that a problem does not
exist since the faculty voted in its favor. However, the short-
comings of the present system are still with us. With this in
mind, we can be certain future changes will be called for by
the faculty.

We believe, and we think the faculty does also, that the
initiative for reforms should come from the IFC itself. The
IFC should legislate improvements for fraternity rush, not
the faculty.

Lynwood Pullen 1907-1968

Lynwood Pullen will be missed. No longer will he sit
behind the linotype machine setting copy for the Ring-tum
Phi. No longer will he be standing behind the stone composing
the paper, listening to our gripes and giving advice.

In the 17 years that Lynwood worked at the Journalism
Laboratory he came in contact with many students and im-
mediately became their friend. In the three and a half years
we knew Lynwood, we were never conscious of a generation
gap between us and him. He tried to understand our desires |
and goals. Even when he did not agree with us he would’
reason with us rather than intimidate us.

The Ring-tum Phi may not look different in the weeks
to come. The format and content may be the same. But we
will always know something is missing.

Deferred Rush: Two Points of View

“A Trivial Resolution”

By RON KESSLER

The faculty’s recent action, (or
more appropriately their inaction) in
withdrawing their demand for de-
ferred rush is deplorable, cowardly,
and hypocritical; aside from all of
this, it doesn’t make any sense.

The history of deferred rush on
this campus helps explain the above
assertions.

In 1961, the faculty overwhelm-
ingly defeated a proposal of one of
its members to force the fraternities
into a deferred rush situation.

Five years later, the faculty nearly
unanimously passed a resolution stat-
ing, “Resolved, that the faculty ex-

press to the Interfraternity Council
its opinion that a program of de-
ferred rush would benefit the Uni-
versity both educationally and fra-
ternally.”

The IFC, in true form, panicked,
and spent several months evading
the issue at hand. On | May 1967,
the faculty issued a second resolution,
stating:

“This faculty commends the IFC
for its study of pledging activities
and for its action in the matter
fining several houses for hazing.”
However, these changes are not a
satisfactory response to the resolu-
tion of the faculty of November,

1966.

“Since this faculty prefers that

 

deferred rush come about by stu-
dent action rather than by faculty
edict the IFC is requested to pre-
sent to the faculty for approval
not latter than November 1, 1967
a plan of deferred rush to become
effective for the school year 1968-
1969. An acceptable plan would
incorporate one of the following
programs: deferral until the end of
the first semester, or deferral until
the end of the freshman year.” The
resolution passed, 43-28.

At the meeting that passed this
resolution, Dr. Edward L. Pinney as-
serted that deferred rush is “a
minimal condition under which fra-
ternities might continue to enjoy some
tenure at Washington and Lee.” This
Statement appeared to summarize the
feelings of the majority of the fac-
ulty.

 

rush freshmen be permitted to bring
cars to school,

5. “... anxiety should not be over-
whelmingly great in a leisurely at-
mosphere of delayed pledging, and
tension due to attemtped ‘false faces’
should die after a short period.
Neither fraternities nor individual
freshmen could hope to maintain
facades for two or three months” or
longer (Source: R-t P—16 December
1968).

The present system of early rush
essentially gives freshmen the alterna-
tives of “which fraternity.” A system
of deferred rush would add an addi-
tional alternative, one of “whether or
not fraternity.” Each freshman de-
serves this additional choice. It is ob-
vious that the Interfraternity Council
will not of its own accord introduce
deferred rush. It is up to the faculty

to again reverse its decision; this
would be an act in the best interests
of the students, in spite of the
students.

 

 

Later, the faculty gave the IFC a|
one year extension on deferred rush |
since the Student Union would not |

be finished until 1969; it was felt
that the Student Union would pro-
vide the social outlet freshmen would
lose by not having early rush.

The IFC, after innumerable polls,
complaints, petitions, requests, groans,
moans, et al, ad nauseum finally got
down to business and presented two
plans to the faculty, one of which
was recommended to the faculty by
the faculty executive committee. This
plan, however, was rejected Monday
night by the faculty along with two
other plans for deferred rush.

Meaningless Resolution

The only accepting the faculty did
on Monday was to endorse a mean-
ingless and trivial resolution stating,
“It is the sense of the faculty that
the Interfraternity Council give close
attention to ways to eliminate pledg
ing activities throughout the first
semester,”

Objections to deferred rush have
been raised by the IFC since 1966
Essentially, they follow this line:

1. Fraternities would fold due to
the lack of funds the freshmen usually
provide.

2. “Dirty rush” would increase

3, Freshman-upperclass communi-
cations would cease to exist.

4, Freshmen would have no social
life

5. Fraternity tension and freshman
anxiety would be prolonged

Answers to these objections can
easily be provided,

1, Fraternity expenditures can be
decreased, Social budgets, on the aver
age of $5,000 per year per house
could be cut first semester and in-
creased second semester. Fraterni
ties would save $8,000 to $10,000
per year on rush book expenses, A
rushee fee could be charged and
turned over to the fraternities to help

“Overjoyous!

By CLARK CARTER
IFC President

Since November 7, 1966, when the
first resolution passed the faculty ask-
ing the IFC to prepare a plan for
deferred rush, fraternity men have
been forced to stand back and take
a long introspective look at the pres-
ent rushing system and the possibili-
ties for an alternative. For a multi-
plicity of reasons the vast majority
of fraternities considered the present
pre-school rush the best for all con-
cerned; however, by being forced to
devise rushing plans which embodied
various deferral periods, fraternity
men have viewed every angle of rush-
ing. In short, anticipating deferred
rush has had a broadening effect on
fraternities. Both strong and weak
points have been noted in the present
rush.

When the faculty decided Monday
night to allow rushing as it is pres-
ently is done, nearly all fraternity
men were Overjoyously satisfied. But

Had it not been for the superb

From the opening of the Mozart

evident that the audience would ex-
perience some great music making.
This trio is one of three composed in
1788 when Mozart was 32. During
the summer of that year he also
composed three of his greatest sym-

fraternities must not regard the fac-
ulty’s decision as some sort of re-
sounding victory for student power,
as it were. What must not be over-
looked is the recommendation in their
resolution to defer pledging activities
until after the first semester. I be-
lieve this to be a responsible and
wise suggestion on the faculty’s be-
half.

It is my hope that their recom-
mendations will be met with the same
responsibility that the deferred rush
resolution received.

After the long and extensive evalua-
tion of rushing and pledging by the
IFC, I hope that most fraternity men
will see the positive aspects of a de-
ferred pledging period. During the
first semester freshmen as pledges
should be allowed to attend parties,
utilize all of the house’s facilities,
and participate in intramural athletics.
The houses, on the other hand, would
not require anything whatsoever from
the pledges other than payment of
the house bills. This arrangement for
the first semester would solve at least
one weak point of pre-school rush;
the freshman would be able to estab-
lish a firm academic grounding with-
out having fraternities competing with
professors for his time. A much need-
ed by-product would be the shorten-
ing and lessening of the artificial
humiliation period known as pledge
training which still lingers somewhat.

I foresee the passage of such a
reform in the present system as an
opportunity for the IFC to prove it-
self again a responsible and sensitive
body.

UFOCC Collects
Needed Clothes;
Service Planned

The United Federation of Christian
Concern Clothing Drive, held sev-
eral weeks ago for the benefit of
the Rockbridge County Welfare
Office, surpassed all expectations and
exceeded last year’s record collection.
John Crockett and Gil Frank, who
directed the effort, were aided to a
large extent in distribution and col-
lection by the Circle K Club.

The drive was expanded this year
to include several area churches. Fra-
ternity participation was considerably
improved over last year, while the
faculty box in front of Washington
Hall reaped its usual large quantity.

An estimated 300 to 400 pounds
of clothing was finally amassed.
Crockett summed up the drive by
stating, “All in all, the response
was extremely good. The quality, as
well as the quantity, ran unusually
high, and practically all the material
collected will prove useful to Lex-
ington’s needy,”

Candlelight Service

On December 18 the United Fed-
eration of Christian Concern will
sponsor the annual Candlelight Ser-
vice. Open to both the Lexington
community as well as the University
community, the service will be held
in the R. E. Lee Memorial Episcopal
Church, rather than Lee Chapel. This
change in location will not only pro-
vide additional seating but also will
allow the use of actual candles.

event is the responsibility of Bob

Fechnay & Mitchell
Chosen All-State

Washington and Lee’s two out-
standing soccer players, Scot Fechnay
and Thom Mitchell have been chosen
as members of the Virginia All-State
Soccer team.

Both Fechnay and Mitchell are
Delt seniors, both were co-captains
this year and both hail from the
North. Fechnay lives in Mountain
Lakes, New Jersey, and Mitchell is
from Middletown, New York.

Fechnay was Coach Joe Lyles’ lead-
ing scorer as center-forward for the
last three years (he was also a stand-
out his freshman year) and conse-
quently is being named to his third
All-State first team.

Mitchell did not play soccer his

 

freshman year. Beginning with his
sophomore year, he was the mainstay
in front of the Generals’ goal—always
looking good, often spectacular, in
blocking shots. Because of his fine
performance in each of the past two
years, he has been selected honorable
mention as goalie on the All-State
team.

Their coach, Joe Lyles, calls them
“two of the finest soccer players I
have ever had the pleasure of coach-
ing. I, personally, and the entire
soccer program will certainly miss
them, as players of their ability, atti-
tude and sportsmanship come along
once in a great while. We were for-
tunate to have had two such boys at
Washington and Lee.”

 

With Intramurals

By THUNDER THORTON

The intramural season moves in-
doors for the winter months with
competition in bowling, handball and
table tennis.

The bowling season runs from
November to February 11, with the
finals set for February 12. Handball
runs from December 3 until Febru-
ary 11. Table tennis will follow the
same schedule. Championships in
both sports are set for the evening
of February 14 and 17.

Before the Thanksgiving holidays
the football championship was de-
cided in a three-way sudden death
playoff between the Phi Gams, SAEs

and Phi Delts, all of whom had
identical 2-1 records in the regular
playoffs,

The SAEs won the first game, beat-
ing the Phi Delts and earned a
berth in the deciding game against
the Phi Gams, who drew a bye.
However ,the final game was a fre-
peat of the previous Phi Gam-SAE
matchup, with the Phi Gams winning
big and cornering the trophy with a

25-7 victory. The final results gave
the Phi Delts third and the Phi Kaps
fourth.

A pre-Thanksgiving meeting of the
fraternity athletic directors produced
some important business. A decision
was made to allow the Law School
to return to the intramural program
on a probationary basis. Any further
misdemeanors would result in a perm-
anent expulsion. Bart Taylor, student
intramural director, commended the
fraternities for their inceasing par-
ticipation in the program, an in-
crease reflected by the total participa-
tion points earned by the houses, a
total that exceeds by over 300 points
last year’s total at this time.

The new interest is also reflected
in a tight race for the intramural
point lead. Before the swimming meet
last month, only eight points separat-
ed the first five fraternities. SPE was
leading, followed by the Phi Delts,
Betas, Sigma Chis and Phi Kaps. The
football totals will put the Phi Delts
into first.

Taylor said that to add interest
to the intramurals an All-IM football
team will be selected from the mem-
bers of the four finalists. He also
said there will be similar all-star
teams selected for other sports in
the winter and spring.

 

Winter Teams

Cagers Bow

Then Run by Bridgewater

Washington and Lee’s basketball
team opened its 1968 season on a
less than enthusiastic note Monday
night as the ylost to Randolph-Macon,
78-71. The game was perhaps closer
than the score may indicate—at least
for three quarters of the game.

The game opened slowly as both
teams were feeling each other out
while at the same time trying to
smooth out their own systems under
actual game situations for the nitial
time in 1968.

Midway through the first half the
Tigers opened up a slight lead but
just before the half ended they saw
their lead wittlhed away by a de-
termine group of Generals. At the
buzzer the Generals had managed
to grab the lead—by a single point.

Beginning early in the second half
the game began to take on the look
of a down-to-the-wire finish as the
two teams stayed close to each other.
Then with about ten minutes left
in the game and W&L still holding
its one point lead, there came a five
minute period which changed the en-
tire complexion of the game.

Suddenly the Generals couldn't
manage to hold on to the ball.
Randolph-Macon capitalized on turn-
over after turnover by W&L to wipe
out the Generals lead and build a big
lead for themselves.

With five minutes left in the game
and the Tigers holding a big lead,
the Generals regrouped and began
playing good basketball again. But
even their full-court press which
brough them the last seven points of
the game was unable to overcome the
Tigers insurmountable lead and the
Generals tasted defeat in Doremus
Gym for the first time in 24 games.
Also maintained was the Tigers’ jinx
over W&L which now stretches back
for nine years.

Bright spots for W&L were four
Generals who placed in double
figures. Mike Neer paced the Generals
with 18 points, followed by Stu
Fauber’s 16, Norwood Morrison's 13,
and Mike Daniels’ 13. Daniels, only
a freshman, came off the bench in
scoring his 13 and was very impres-
sive.

The Generals equaled the rebound-
ing total of Randolph-Macon—each
pulled down 46, Neer aagin paced the
Generals with 13 rebounds and Mel
Cartwright grabbed 11. One factor
which certainly hurt the Generals was

to Macon

Mel Cartwright’s badly sprained ankle
which severly restricted his play. He
only managed 8 points.

On Wednesday the Generals took
the floor at Doremus once again—

determined to start a new home
winning streak. With both Cart-
wright’s ankle and the Generals’

poise much improved, W&L romped
to victory over Bridgewater by the
lopsided score of 94-63.

Bridgewater having scouted the
Generals, opened with a press—hop-
ing to force Generals turnovers that
had come so readily in their first
game. But it was a calmer General
team and after the first 13 minutes
the Generals held a slim lead. Then
Daniels came off the bench to score
two quick baskets and the Generals
were off to the races.

The W&L spurted to a command-
ing lead at halftime and turned the
game into a rout in the second
half. Neer again paced the Generals
in scoring and rebounding—getting
26 points and 15 rebounds, Cart-
wright was once again playing like
the Cartwright of old and netted 23
points and grabbed 8 rebounds. Stu
Farber and Bill Rhyne each chipped
in with 10 points to again give W&L
four players in double figures. The
Generals also won the rebounding
battle 48-36.

Freshmen Lose

Washington and Lee's freshmen
basketball team opened its season
Monday night against Randolph-
Macon’s freshman team, However the
freshmen suffered the same fate as
the varsity—a loss. Rob Faust and

Begin S
Tankmen Meet
American U.

This year finds swimming coach
Bill Stearns optimistic about the com-
ing season. “This is one of the best
teams we've had in quite a few years
here. They are a group of extremely
dedicated individuals that I'm happy
to be able to work with. They've
responded well to hard work.”

Part of the reason Coach Stearns
is optimistic is because of the re-
turn of co-captain Billy Ball, who
just missed being an All-American
last year. The other co-captain is
Ross Foreman, who is expected to
be strong in the freestyle.

Other top natators include juniors
Cal Cameron, Dave Kympton, and
sophomore Scott McElroy. Roger
Martin has rejoined the team after
a year’s absense and will provide
depth in sprints and the backstroke.

Perhaps Coach Sterans brightest
hope is freshman John Lawlor, who
has already set a school record in
practice and is expected to add a
couple of more. Another freshman
expected to see action is Klein Stuart,
who will swim the breast stroke.

Last week they put a practice meet
under their belts by competing against
VMI. The event was pleasing to
Stearns because of the practice in a
25 yard pool and because of some
of the surprising performances by the
W&L tankmen.

Things start for real today at 4
p.m. in Doremus Gymnasium when
the swimmers entertain American
University of Washington, D.C. W&L
has not been able to beat them for
several years. Monday WA&l will
entertain Roanoke College.

Other top teams on the Generals’
schedule include Catholic Univeristy
of Washington, D. C., whom W&L
has not defeated in four years, and
such highly subsidized teams as U.Va.,
Penn State, and West Virginia.

Wrestling coach Dick Miller usu-
ally whistles while he works, but
when asked about his team’s pros-

pects he delivers one of his own
compositions: “Whistling in the
Dark.”

That’s because Miller has the same
old problem of late: lack of depth
and inexperience. He’s relying on
youth to help him change his tune.

The lower weight classes, always
a problem for the Generals, are be-
ing filled with freshmen candidates.
Co-captain Razz Rasberry, a 130-
pounder, is the only veteran in the
lower weights.

Junior Dave Higgins holds down
the 152-pound slot, and everyone is
waiting for senior co-captain Jay
Clarke to pare his 190 football
pounds down to help in the 160 to
167 wrestling range.

Clark Carter, Dan Webster and
John (Dee) Copenhaver round out the
weight classes and all have mat ex-
perience. But from there Coach
Miller starts puckering up.

The first test for the W&L wrestl-
ers will be a severe one as the Gen-
erals open their season tonight
against Towson State in an 8 p.m.
home match at Doremus Gym.

Other matches will be against such
schools as North Carolina, Loyola,
Virginia Commonwealth, Western
Maryland and North Carolina.

Who’s in Charge

W&L Trustees
Still Rule But
Have Delegated
No One Can Really

Say Who Holds
Seats Of Power

 

Students Have Little To Do

By Reep Byrum,
Tue Rinc-Tum Put Staff.

The Board of Trustees of Wash-
ington and Lee University represent
the most ultimately powerful organi-
zation upon this campus today; un-
contested as this statement may go,
this group, however, no longer holds
true control over the administration
of the innumerable functions of this
college.

Since 1964 when the Self-Study
Committee of Washington and Lee
reported to the school that a “revised
plan of administrative organization
should be adopted” by the Board of |
Trustees, this generally unnoticed
organ of power has undergone al- |
most a complete change, implement- |
ing an entirely new governmental
establishment. A broad outline of
this can be rather easily obtained by
referring to page 411 of “The Self-
Study Report of Washington and Lee
University,” with more concise deline-
ation of this plan being available in
the preceding 15 pages. A rather brief
summary of the present system of
control will now be given for the
sake of both expediency and facility.

The Board of Trustees maintains
executive responsibility of Washing-
ton and Lee, being that it is the rul-
ing corporate body of the university.
Containing fifteen lifetime members
and the president, this group assigns
administrative responsibility to the
faculty and leadership, maintains the
financial stablity of the school, elects
new presidents and trustees, and pro-
vides for the academic and physical
excellence of the college.

The President of the University acts
as liason officer for the Board with
the other officers of the administra-
tion. It is his duty to convey the
desires of the Trustees to the deans
and to the faculty and to secure con-
tinuity and stability in the administra-
tion of the school, He sets forth the
policies of the Board and then makes
sure that these are carried out by
his subordinate associates. The latter
are the dean and assistant dean of

 

 

 

the College, dean of the College of
Law, and dean of the School of
Commerce and Administration. They
also convey the directives of the
Board, but only those of general
policy making; within each of these |
academic divisions, autonomous gov- |
ernment is maintained by their re-
spective officers and faculty.

Under the dean of the College
are the registrar and the teaching
body of this division. The dean is)
the chief administrator and is chair-|
man of the Executive Committee of
the academic staff, the latter body
making general recommendations of
concern to the entire College. The

faculty is divided into numerous sub- |
committees, such as the Curriculum,
the Admissions, and the Courses and
Degrees Committees, which are in
charge of studying and enforcing vari-
ous faculty policies and making)
recommendations to the body as a
whole. The Schools of Law and Com-
merce are similarly structured with
only minor modifications to accomo-
date their own needs.

The president once again enters the
organization in the fifth level of
power in his direct leadership of the
Dean of Students, the MeCormick
Library, and two special assistants to
himself. The Dean of Students directs
with aid from subordinates the Ad-
missions Office, the Financial Aid
Office, the Chaplain’s Office, and the
Health Services; the library is per:
sonally run by the librarian, whose
total responsiblity is the maintainence
of McCormick. One assistant to the
president directs the Office of In
formation and Publications, the Office
of Institutional Research, and Lee
Chapel, while the other has jurindic-
tion over the service and grounds
staffs and the service organizations,
such as the Book Store and the

Dining Hall

ATURDAY — CLASSES

were abolished yesterday
by the faculty in a voice vote.
Next semester a new class
scheduling arrangement will go
into effect, whereby there will
be three meetings of one class
one week (the “odd” week)
and two meetings the next
(“even”) week.

The plan which will go into
effect is currently being used
at Lynchburg College; it was
proposed to the student body
for a vote last spring by The
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi, in
which vote it was overwhelm-
ingly favored; it was endorsed
by the student body Executive
Committee this fall; and it was
recommended by the faculty
committee-as-a-whole in Octo-
ber.

Monday through Friday, and
are completed at 12:55. Per-
iods are 55 minutes long;
afternoon schedules (labs,
seminars, etc.) and examina-
tions are not affected. The
school year will remain the

same.

Deferred pledging activi-
ties will be mandatory for fra-
ternities next year, as the IFC
approved unanimously in an
18-0 vote on a motion by vice-
president Roddy Roediger that
rallies, work days, and the like
be outlawed for first-semester
pledges.

Greek Week was also abo-
lished, by voice vote, on a mo-
tion by Roediger. In its stead
will go some event to be de-
termined later by the IFC.

And in unprecedented act-
ion, the IFC voted 12-0-5 to
outlaw fraternity rush publica-
tions, on a motion by junior
justice Bob Trout. Each house
will be alloted 3 pages in the
official IFC rush publication,

The motions passed by the
IFC at last week's meeting are
still being considered by the
student-faculty Student Affairs
Committee. The motions were
that girls be allowed upstairs in
fraternity houses and that girls
not be made to leave houses

On recommendation of the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the faculty, the
faculty at its meeting on December
9 approved the following policies with
reference to allowing students ex-
cused absence to leave school early
to work before the Christhas holi-
days:

A student who submits evidence
that he has a job and a statement
that he is currently receiving financial
aid may, on application, be excused
for a maximum of 2 days (Dec. 20
and 21). Applications for such ex-
cuses should be made on or before
Dec. 16, Monday, to the office of the
Associate Dean of the College, Dr.
Waitt.

After the holidays, the excused stu-
dent shall report to Dr. Watt on his
employment to validate the excuse of
his absences. Otherwise, such absences
shall be considered unauthorized.

By Reeve KELsey,
Tue Rinc-Tum Put Staff.

“Eighteen national social fraterni-
ties are represented on the Washing-
ton and Lee campus... All eighteen
fraternities maintain chapter houses
in Lexington, and the University re-
quires a resident housemother for
each. Approximately eighty per cent
of all Washington and Lee students
affiliate with fraternities, making
these organizations an important in-
fluence upon student life.”

The brief account of fraternities
quoted above from the University
Bulletin does poor justice to represent-
ing fraternities to the public. Besides
the academic work of the student,
fraternities are the most important
facet of the University for a large
majority of W&L gentlemen. The
evolution of fraternities into their
present format of eighteen nationals
proves very interesting history where
it is increasingly impossible to dis-
tinguish legend from fact.

it all started in 1855 when Phi
Kappa Psi became the first national
on the campus. There is strange irony
that next year they will present the
facade of the newest as they move
into their newly constructed house,
clearly confident of the future.

The great splurge of fraternity ex-
pansion started immediately after the
Civil War when 10 charters were
granted in the 7 year period from
1865 to 1873; we hasten to add that
§ of these chapters are now defunct,
but that is a later story, The most
recent period of fraternity expansion
was during the 1920s which saw 5
new chapters ultimately emerge at
WAL,

A grand total of 26 nationals have
at one time or another been represent-
ed in Lexington, While some had
their charters revoked, others merely
faded out of existence.

Alpha Tau Omega provides per-
haps the most interesting saga, Much
legend has surrounded this fraternity
including the much repeated epsiode
with the C&O railroad, although this
event is not the major reason for
their demise. The ATOs reasoned
(somewhat incorrectly) that if they
removed their mortgage from the Uni-
versity, the University would no long-
er have any control over their activi-
ties (assumption incorrect), They then
obtained a loan from a Staunton bank
and purchased the remaining portion
of the mortgage from the University,

Then, as Dean Gilliam tells it,
the fateful day of December 7, 1941,
rudely intervened and most of the
fraternities became inactive. The be-
nevolent University suspended all
interest and principal payments for
the duration of the war and granted
each fraternity a gift of $2000 to help
it get started again, But the ATO's
bank in Staunton, being essentially a
profit making institution, needed its
money, and when the ATOs could)
not make the payments the bank |
foreclosed and sold the house, The
ATOs returning from the war, lack-
ing a house, money, and the impetus
to start again, simply faded away

IT CAN'T BE SAID that the W&L
faculty isn’t keeping busy with its
research and writing. In the past few
years, the faculty has produced over
thirty books dealing with a wide
range of topics.

THE MOST RECENT ADDITION
to the list of faculty publications is
Dr. Allen W. Moger’s “Virgnia:
Bourbonism to Byrd, 1870 to 1925.”
The book is a general history of
Virginia from its restoration days to
the election of Harry F. Byrd as
governor. It deals with the develop-
ment of the Democratic Party and
the Conservative heritage of Virginia
politics.

which will be published in May, 1969
by Random House, one of America’s
most distinguished publishing houses,
will be called “General Lee's Col-

Our System

A 100-Year-Old
Tradition Still
Lives At W&L

 

Code Administrators
Retain Honor’s
Ultimate Penalty

But Some Say Honor’s Out

By Ropert H. Yevicn,
Tue Rinc-Tum Pui Staff.

One of the fundamental aspects of
life at W&L over the past century
has been the tradition of the honor
system. The fact that this deliberate
tradition, enforced by the students,
has flourished for so long testifies to
that unique power it exercises over
the students. Certainly, if students
did not respect the honor system, it
would have been buried with the
nineteenth century.

But what is that power it exercises
which has made it a fact of life at
WAL for one hundred years? In
theory, the honor system encompasses
every area of a student's behavior
while he is associated with the insti-
tution. This gentlemanly code dates
back to the character mold poured
by Robert E. Lee during his admini-
stration as president of Washington
College. Ideally, the driving force of
the honor system lies in its ability
to instill in students the desire to be
such perfect gentlemen.

But, in practice, the honor system
connotes a more realistic meaning to
the students of 1968. This meaning
consists of the realization that if a
student commits an infraction of
those hallowed rules of behavior, and
is ensnared by the laws of the code,
he may then be asked to leave.

Naturally, the administration of
this code is an important facet of
the honor system. The tangible aspect
of the system is left squarely on the
shoulders of the “supreme court” of
the student body, the elective Ex-
ecutive Committee. Frequently, their
assigned task of governing their fel-
low students amounts to administer-
ing the honor system by interpreting
the honor code.

In consideration of the size of
the University. the element of secrecy
was introduced to afford a certain
amount of protection to those students
who in some way might become in-
volved with the mechanics of the
system. Usual honor trials are con-
ducted by the Executive Committee
behind closed doors with the names
of defendents and witnesses gener-
ally withheld from public knowledge.

However, the advantage of an open
honor trial is available to a student
who feels that he has been unjustly
convicted of an honor offense in a
closed honor trial.

Again, the question of whether or
not a conviction (or acquittal) was
just or unjust rests solely upon the
interpretation of the Executive Com-
mittee. This avenue for change is a
necessary part of the system. If the
system was not flexible, then it would
become stagnant and lose the respect
it commands over the students,

Fortunately. few students meet the
reality of the honor system head on,
To tell what it is like to have been
asked to leave the University because
of a violation of the honor system,
an anonymous letter by a student who
was convicted of an honor offense
appears on page two of this paper

For most students, encounters with
the honor system are limited to lec
tures at freshman camp, and occas
ional boosters in the form of EC
statements, open honor trials, and
various University publications, How
ever, the threat of the ultimate pen
alty remains strong in the minds of
every student, and it is this threat
which keeps the system alive more
than devotion to the ideal

Recent events pertaining
honor sysiem have generated some
speculation regarding especially the
ability of the system to adapt ade
quately to various situations, In fe
sponse to certain suggestions offered
at last months “Bitch-in,” increased
study is being made by members of

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Responding

An immediate result of last
month’s Executive Committee
“Bitch-in” is the yet-to-be form-
ulated committee on student civil
liberties, headed by senior Jack
Horowitz. Apparently it is Mr.
Horowitz's concern (and the con-
cern of others, if the dialogue at
the “Bitch-in” is a true indicator)
that the EC’s practice of searching
students’ quarters at its discretion
is not a legitimate function of that
body.

Mr. Horowitz may have a point.
In discussing such questions about
the EC’s role in this University,
two fundamental questions need to
be approached: 1) To what exent
is the EC an investigative body?
and 2) What resolution can be
made between individual rights and
the EC’s duty to the student body?

The Executive Committee, de-
spite what some like to say, is an
investigative entity—it must be; and
in its very nature, that of a court
in toto, it must, as Mr. Horowitz
will surely want to point out, ex-
ercise its virtually unchained per-
quisites of power with unimpeach-
able fairness.

And while we're on the subject
of what the EC is doing, some
mention needs to be made of that
body’s impending study of the
Honor System.

It is our understanding that out
of this endeavor should come some
definite statements about the EC's
jurisdiction; a problem here, though,
would arise because such statements
could be interpreted as giving
license to otherwise dishonorable
actions in certain areas. It is also
our undestanding that some addi-
tional (or perhaps revised) pro-
cedures for honor trials will be
formulated. This is seen as an out-
growth of the open honor trial
option; aside from any moralizing,
it is not difficult to realize the pos-
sible discredit that may fall upon
the twelve justices when their ver-
dicts are publicly reversed. Per-
haps this kind of check needs to
be allowed—governmental court
systems work similarly; or, perhaps
such open scrutiny is dangerous to
the honor system.

These and other questions are to
be answered. The need, though
not an urgent one, is evident.

Leadership and Diplomacy

The faculty's lack of action on
deferred rush was a triumph of
sorts for the Inter-Fraternity Coun-
cil. Much could be said in support
of a case that there is no triumph,
that the action was indecisive, that
conditions are imposed on the IFC,
an so forth. But despite these argu-
ments, ultimate analysis awards
“triumph” to those who desired the
actual outcome.

More than anyone else, IFC
President Clark Carter deserves fra-
ternties’ commendation for his role
in this year’s Scenario of the Grand
Rush Drama. Throughout the past
months, his calm leadership and
cool diplomacy have earned the re-
spect of many faculty members—
not the least important of which

were those on the faculty EC.

And Mr. Carter has achieved for
his constitutents more than most
could have expected. His argu-
ments (and the arguments of those
in agreement) for mid-semester rush
must have made sense to many
faculty members.

Not to be ignored are those in
the faculty who, for whatever rea-
son, voted to maintain the status
quo. And at this point Mr. Carter
will find that his task has not
ended. His is the burden of steer-
ing fraternity leadership in this
fresh, positive way until long-need-
ed reforms in pledging activities
are accomplished. The faculty and
the fraternities should be confident
of his ability to do so.

At Long Last, It’s Ended

No more Saturday classes! We've
been waiting a long time to be able
to write that—since last March
when this edition first proposed the
idea and brought it to the attention
of the University community.

Starting next semester, the five-
day week will be a reality at Wash-
ington and Lee. We now join our
neighboring schools in the elimina-
tion of what has long proved an
inconvenience. God bless the fac-
ulty!

About This Edition

As a good friend of ours in the
administration said, the Journalism
Laboratory Press is intended to be
just that—a laboratory. It is with
this in mind that we have publish-
ed this Tuesday on the format of
The Wall Street Journal. But a
few additional comments now be-
come germaine.

It is more difficult than it may
seem tO eXperiment in this par-
ticular laboratory; for example,
such a minor change as the elimi-

ad

nation of column rules on the
editorial page could very likely
push the schedule up two hours
(which would mean the Wednesday
Ring-tum Phi).

Thus this edition was weeks in
the preparation and was difficult
at that. If the finer touches in this
paper today are evident, an especial
word of thanks is due Messrs.
Hunter McCoy and Ed Walker of
the Journalism Laboratory Press,
whose patience and extra time made
this edition possible.

The Sports History Of A Small College

By Roy Carton,
THE Rinc-Tum Pur Staff.

It was nearly fifteen years ago that
Washington and Lee surprised sports
enthusiasts all over the nation by
completely desubsidizing a fairly suc-
cessful athletic program. That deci-
sion was probably the most important-
one the Board of Trustees had made
since they elected Robert E. Lee as
President of the college in 1865. The
effects of that event reached far be-
yond the Athletic Department or
even the athletes on scholarship. It was
to affect the very character and stand-
ards of the University which we now
attend.

Athletics and W&L have gone hand
in hand since before the turn of the
century. Back in 1892, a handful of
Minks met their counterparts from
VMI and played the first intercol-
legiate football game south of the
Mason-Dixon line. It was hardly an
auspicious debut for the original Gen-
erals. The Keydets whipped them 6-0
to the embarrassment of every man
at the University.

In following years ,the contests con-
tinued and neighboring schools were
added to the schedule. Intercollegiate
sports became a favorite pastime, and
soon the whole University was getting
excited. A weekly sports page began
appearing in the late ‘90's named
after a favorite cheer, the Ring-tum
Phi. In 1906 the Trustees finally
buckled in to the pressure and built
Doremus Gymnasium, supposedly the
finest of its kind in the south. Also
in 1906, a W&L law student, Mark
Sheafe. made his greatest contribu-
tion to the school. He wrote the
Washington and Lee Swing.

Athletics entered their modern era
in 1933 with the founding of the
Southern Conference. The Generals
joined with other schools in the region
such as Duke, UNC, Maryland, and
South Carolina to form a first class
league. It was also at this time that
subsidization became the byword of
athletics at the University. In order
to compete on the same high level
as conference foes in basketball and
football, athletic scholarships were
granted and recruiting became a
frenzied effort.

The war years halted athletics
temporarily. The student body was
drastically reduced so that the build-
ings could be used by the armed
forces. Athletics ceased to exist. With
the return of peace in 1945 though,
sports, notably football and basket-
ball were revived. The late forties
were particularly lean years. Con-
ference opponents had been compet-
ing continuously, so the Generals had
to start from scratch. About the only
sport that enjoyed success was wrestl-
ing. Throughout the thirties, the Blue
had dominated SC wrestling, and
once again they took up their throne.

The great resurgence of W&L foot-

ball fortunes began in 1950. With ai ;

| The Bookshelf;  coupies

3-5-1 record the year before, the
Minks weren't exactly given glowing
praise in the pre-season estimates.
Coach Barclay had a hard corps of
capable experienced players, though,
in quarterback Gil Bocetti, fullback
Walt Michaels, and center Joe Me-
Cutcheon.

The 1950 Generals were one of
the most explosive teams in WAL
history. Led by the running of
Bocetii and Michaels from a split-T
formation, they scored twenty or
more points in every contest of the
season. The two biggest games just
happened to be WAL's only two de-
feats of the season, too. The Minks
traveled to UVa. for the annual bash
with the Wahoos in early October.
In front of a fierce Cavalier crowd,
the Blue held on to the lead against
a good UVa. team until the final
moments when the Wahoos pulled
out a 27-21 win.

Toward the end of the season, it
became the Generals’ turn to beat
their heads against a stone wall. The
Blue went to Knoxville to face num-

ber one ranked Tennessee. In their |
best game of the year, the Blue came |
close io doing the impossible and

fell short by 27-20,

Season's end found the Minks rank-
ed sixteenth in the country and re-
warded them with their first and
only trip to a bowl. Eleventh ranked
Wyoming was the Generals’ Gator
Bow! opponent, but illness struck and
Michaels and others missed the game.

The result was a forgetable 20-7
drubbing.

A poor football team in 1953
brought matiers to a head. The

alumni were screaming for an in-
crease in athletic scholarships beyond
the thirty already being given. To do
this, the University would have to
stari supporiing the debis of the
Athletic Department, As the spring
of ‘$4 approached, the Trustees look-
ed like they might be about to give
if.

That spring. Washingion and Lee
was rocked by one of the biggest
cheating scandals in iis history. For
some two years, a janitor had heen
gelling copies Of tesis for a group

 

 

of football players. By the time the
Executive Committee had ruled on
all the offenders, the football team
had been decimated. Many of those
who remained unscathed sensed that
WA&L’s gridiron status was liable to
change drastically and transferred to
other colleges.

The Trustees now had to face the
athletic aid question directly. If sub-
sidized football was to remain, many
more scholarships would have to be
given to make up for the last play-
ers. Many Trustees were unhappy
about the idea of admitting players
who might not otherwise be accepted,
especially in the light of the scandal.
The decision was made to suspend
the awarding of more scholarships.
Six had already been granted for
1954-55, Those currently receiving aid
would continue to until graduation.
The 1954 football schedule was for-
feited for the lack of a team.

As the months passed, the Trustees
decided to continue football, but on
a completely unsubsidized _ basis.
Temporarily, W&L would remain in
the Southern Conference.

The winter of 1957-58 saw the last
gasp of big-time college athletics at
the University. The few remaining
scholarship players were seniors then.
After the spring W&L would with-
draw from the SC. One of the play-
ers, a basketball guard named Dom
Flora, took the Generals out in style.

 

The roundballers only finished with
a 9-16 record that year, but Flora had
the distinction of being the last ma-
jor All-American from W&L. A tre-
mendous shooter, Flora was selected
to the first-string team with Oscar
Robertson, Guy Rodgers, Elgin Bay-
lor, and Wilt Chamberlain. After
graduating from the University, Flora
took a try at the NBA but didn’t
make it.

Unsubsidized athletics has brought
a different era to Washington and
Lee sports. University admissions
policies preclude any hope of a suc-
cessful return to the big-time, but
this school has found its nook. The
great football teams of 1960-61-62
have proven that small college status
can be fun. The undefeated and un-
tied team of 1961 even brought
status to the school in the form of
number one small college ranking by
the Washington Touchdown Club,
WA&L’s athletic program also offers
a chance for more men to play on
teams, and it provides better equip-
ment for those who do. Before de-
subsidization the soccer team had an
annual budget of $200.

Small college athletics may not
make the front sports page of the
New York Times or win any Gator
Bowl bids, but it does meet the
needs of the studnets. And, for those
form whom this is not good enough,
Washington and Lee does have a past.

 

Notable & Quotable

 

President Robert E. R. Huntley

on the image of Washington and).

Lee, in his inaugural address,

October 18.

... Et is the image of an institution
which unashamedly proclaims that
there is no higher goal to which a
scholar can aspire than to be a
vital teacher of young men, an insti-
tution which confidently entrusts the
largest possible measure of choice and
freedom to its students and its fac-
ulty, requiring conformity of no one,
prizing an environment in which tol-
erance, integrity, and respect for
others tend to prevent misidentifying
independence of thought with lack of
self-discipline or mindless contempt.

It is the image of an institution
which does not wish to cater to any
particular ethnic or economic group,
but which seeks a diverse student
body and faculty where members may
share in common only the ability
and the conviction to learn from each
other.

It is the image of an institution
which takes seriously the injunctions
which are engraved in its official crest,
adapted, as you know, from the
family coats of arms of the two great
men after whom the school is named:

 

*

“Be not unmindful of the future.”
. » “Question all things.”

It is not the image of an institu-
tion which serves as a marshalling
point or strategy center from which
young men are sent forth daily to
confront the sources of evil the
strategists have identified. Rather, it
is the image of an institution which
sees no prority as higher than the
search for truth and understanding
from which eventually may grow the
kind of wisdom that brings fullness to
life.

What of this image?

It this where the action is?

Or, in the strangely contemptuous
tone of the more recent idiom—lts it
relevant?

The only answer | know is this:
If it is relevant to lead forth the
mind from the dark corners in which
it feeds on its own prejudice and
arrogance and self-righteousness, if,
in short, it is relevant for there to be
men who are truly educated, then
this image is relevant.

Therefore, if at Washington and
Lee University today reality does not
measure up to the image, then let

By Daviv Fretp,
Tue Rinc-Tum Put Staff.

John Updike’s “Couples” presents
a bleak picture of the epoque in which
we live; it is “one of those dark
ages that visits mankind between
millenia, between the death and re-
birth of gods, when there is nothing
to steer but sex and stoicism and the
stars.” Traditional religion has thus
lost relevance in this hopeless situa-
tion, and we have had to substitute
humans for God. They are, however,
inadequate: the tragedy of the Ken-
nedy family underlines the main plot:
“Strange, he thought, how pain seeks
that couple out. Not wealth nor
beauty no homage shelters them. Suf-
fering tugging at a king's robe. Our
fragile gods.”

Furthermore, there has been an
exodus from the church as a religious
institution: the movement to suburban
communities has fostered a new “re-
ligion” whose foundation is inter-
personal relationships. Updike ex-
plores this idea by examining Tarbox,
a suburb of Boston, and focusing on
the activities of ten couples. We are
immediately aware of both the ritu-
alistic, religious aspect of this culture
and iis sexual overtones. The small
group of couples is described as “a
circle. A magic circle of heads to
keep the night out.” They have “made
a church of each other.”

This new church is not wiccessful,
however, for as the couples’ private
lives are probed it becomes apparent
that the “magic circle” is not a source
of unity and strength, but rather the
boundary within which each of the
participanis is destroyed. A keyhole
view of the devastation of two couples
is provided as Updike zooms in on
the Applebys and Smiths. His de-
scription of their aspirations shows
his conception of one segment of
American society:

“They belonged to that segment of
iheif generation of the upper middle

 

class which mildly rebelled against
the confinement and discipline where-
by wealth maintained its manners dur-
ing the unheavals of depression and
world war . . . Introduced into a
nation whose leadership allowed a
toothless moralism to dissemble a
certain practiced cunning, into a cul-
ture where adolescent passions and
homosexual philosophies were not
quite yet triumphant, a climate still
furtively hedonist . . . to this new
world the Applebys and Smiths
brought a modest determination to
be free, to be flexible and decent
... They... settled the year round
in unthought-of places, in pastoral
mill towns like Tarbox, and tried to
improvise here a fresh way of life.
Duty and work yielded as ideals to
truth and fun. Virtue was no longer
sought in temple or market place
but in the home—one’s own home,
and then the homes of one’s friends.”

The Applebys and Smithes are un-
able to attain their goal of a new
virtue, however. Contrast their ideals
expressed above with the following
scene in the Appleby's laundry room;
Harold Appleby and Janet Smith
have just discovered beyond a doubt
that their mates are having an affair
with each other: “Her body, his
height, they dragged each other down,
into a heap of unwashed clothes,
fluffy ends of shirtsleeves and pajama
pants, the hard floor underneath them
like a dank bone .. . His face was
half-pillowed in dirty clothes smelling
mildly of his family, of Jonathan and
Julia and Henrietta and Marcia. He
was lying on ghosts that had in-
nocently sweated.”

Thus their ambition to find ful-
fiilment in a circle of personal friends
turned to a pathetic adulterous
jumble. The cause is both from with-
out and within: from without, there
is this age in which “there is nothing
to steer but sex and stoicism and
the siars.” That conception of sex

From The Editor

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

I very much appreciate your nice
words about The Wall Street Jour-
nal, and I am flattered that you plan
to try to imitate us in one of the
forthcoming editions of The Ring-
tum Phi. I will be interested to see
how you adopt The Wall Street
Journal approach to the material in
the Washington and Lee student
newspaper. I not only wish you a lot
of luck in the project, but I am
looking forward to seeing a copy of
that edition, which I assure you I
will read avidly,

On Being Kicked Out

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

There are a lot of fears, I’m sure,
surrounding the operations of the
Honor System at Washington and
Lee—and let me tell you that they
are well-founded fears. I was the
victim of the cruel but necessary pro-
cedures of the Honor System, and
was cast, less than fate in the familiar
song, not to the winds, but into the
doldrums of despondency and self-
despite.

IT am a better man for having
been asked to leave the school. (By
the way, they do ask you to leave,
I guess if you said no, they'd make
you though.) But this is of small con-
solation as I am brought to tears
at each of the frequent remembrances
of having spoiled my very own con-
science,

What I did was done in a moment
of frenzy—a paper, due the next
day, was not even begun yet. What
could I do but steal? Of course, the
answer is that I could have done
a hell of a lot more, including flunk-
ing the course, but I chose the route
of dishonor. | found a very good
book, and I copied it, or rather parts
of it, in such great detail and with
such a lack of finesse or whatever
I should have used that I was im-
mediately discovered by the profes-
sor involved.

At the Honor Trial, I readily ad-
mitted what I had done, | was asked
why. I said because | wanted to get
away with something, that | wanted
to cover up for work which I had
not really done myself. | suppose that
was all that needed to be said, other
than perhaps the professor telling the
EC all about how much I had
plagiarized.

That's about all there is to it. I

THE RING-TUM PHI, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1968

 

The Bookshelf

originates on Madison Avenue and
filters through the whole society: “All
her formal education, from Disney's
‘Snow White’ to last week’s ‘Life,’
had taught her to place the highest
value on love. Nothing but a kiss
undid the wicked apple. We move
from birth to death amid a crowd of
others and the name of the parade
is love. However unideal it was, she
dreaded being left behind. Hence she
could not stop flirting, could not
stop reaching out...”

Is there any answer to this world
which seems to have a_ built in
misery factor? Perhaps, for one source
of the misery is within: “What im-
presses me isn’t so much human
self-deception as human igenuity in
creating unhappiness. We believe in
it, unhappiness is in us. From Eden
on, we've voted for it. We manu-
facture misery, and feed ourselves
on poison.” We have built much of
our culture on a chase: we chase
after love, after success—concepts
which are too diaphanous to grasp
even if they exist.

“Couples” is limited in scope, aim-
ing its barbs exclusively at one stratum
of American society; nevertheless, it
must be realized that this is the sec-
tor of our body politic which has
been called the “carriers of the creed;”
these are those to whom the less well
endowed look for their styles, and
to whom those who lead the country
listen, Represented among the couples
are scientists, successful businessmen,
a dentist, a contractor—in short, in-
fluential citizens. Their
though not
portant and, to the extent Updike
accurately generalizes, his is a valu-
able book. He limits himself, how-
ever, to what is almost one factor
analysis: the reader is carried along
on a sea of pubis throughout the
entire tone. One gets tired of read-
ing of each of the characters’ sexual
idiosyncracies and impotencies—it
would seem that more than sex
drives men onward “toward the cliff.”
Updike’s analysis, like those whom he
analyzes, is severly limited. Thus
the book, like its characters, is in-

maladies, |
the countries’, are im-|

fluential but not great; it somehow
fails to rise above the social milieu
and is satified at the mere hinting of
ideas which would permit liberation
from a stultifying atmosphere.

On Being Kicked Out

bers of the EC, who helped me
arrange things. You see, I wanted,
very much, to leave as soon as pos-
sible. I knew a notice would be up
the next day, and I knew many would
know who it was. And I’m. sure
the EC wanted me to leave right
away, too. They acted that way. It
was sort of like a silent understand-
ing between us.

Nothing was said as | and those
two EC members walked around with
me, except I asked them if 1 could
be alone to call my parents. I guess
1 should have called them before,
but whenever you're in trouble like
that (not many of us are, I hope!),
you always have some hope that it
will all blow over and that you can
forget about it and go in the class
as though nothing had happened. So
I called by parents that night, late,
very late, and told them | had been
convicted of an Honor Violation.
There was no reaction, just silence.
I went on and explained to them
all the details of it, then told them
1 would fly home soon, that I had
enough money. | told them I was
sorry for the money they had wasted,
that | would try to make it up to
them.

My parents made it easy on me.
My mother cried, of course, but she
| said things like, “My poor baby,”
and “We still love you.” I started
crying too. My father said not to
worry about anything, that he would
wire a ticket to Roanoke that night,
and that he was sure | could get
into a college very soon. We hung up,

all of us in tears by then.

As I rejoined the two EC mem-
bers, crying (me, not them), I could
sense not only their pity, which is a
great thing for a man to feel of
another, but also their sense of duty
and their sense of pride in having
done the right thing.

The Ring-tum Phi asked me to
write this, because, they said, it was
for an important paper which would
deal with fundamental aspects of
Washington and Lee. | am happy to
offer this to the students of W&L
through the Ring-tum Phi, hoping
that everyone will take a good hard
look at the Honor System, will keep
my story in mind, and will act ac-
cordingly. I really don’t mean to
preach, but you just try to live with
yourself if you get kicked out of
college for an honor violation.

And thus seven levels of power
exist in the administration of Wash-
ington and Lee, and overall, thirty
division of responsibility can be made
among this grandiose systems of ad-
ministration. However, the most im-
portant part of this university has
seemingly been overlooked: the stu-
dent body. But it enters this organi-
zational setup in only the most in-
significant and infrequent manners.

Students at W&L are represented
on only four of some thirty-six faculty
committees and have no direct line

ments or will; for they are restricted
from attendance or membership in
either of these groups and must thus
employ indirect methods of exposing
their views. It is hastened to be add-
ed that such means are far from
obscure, and the faculty and the presi-
dent individually maintain a constant
level of communication and of com-
prehension of student needs.

Thus, Washington and Lee pos-
sesses an extremely complex, yet well
organized, system of administration
through the Board of Trustees, with
the ultimate purpose being to serve
the ever present needs of the student
body.

BULLETIN—Mary Baldwin Col-
lege officially suspended school
operations today.

Southern Seminary appears to have
been the latest area school to suc- |
cumb to the widespread flu epidemic
when the school was closed some time

this morning.

School officials were unavailable
for comment.

Elsewhere in area campuses the
situation varied. By Thursday three
schools had closed. Hollins and
Lynchburg Colleges were the first

ending their classes on Wednesday.
Randolph-Macon Woman's College at
12:30 Thursday afternoon.

However, most other schools to the
east and north of Lexington re-
ported that the flu situation was well
under control on their campuses.

Thursday afiernoon Sweet Briar |
reported only three or four cases in
the infirmary with symptoms similar
to those of the Hong Kong flu which
has taken its toll on other campuses.
Mary Baldwin reported “only seven
or eight girls in the infirmary with
what looks like regular flu.”

The nurse at the infirmary at
Southern Seminary seemed to think
yesterday that the situation was
under control there, however. She
reported “a few cases of bad colds
and flu, but no Hong Kong flu.”

Nurse Agnor at the W&L infirm-
ary reported that the situation was
not serious here. Yesterday she said,
“There are a few more than usual
in the infirmary, but they have mostly
colds, viruses, and so forth. We have
had no Hong Kong flu.”

This afternoon she said that still
no cases of Hong Kong flu had been
identified. She added, “We've got
beds for anybody that’s sick.”

Dr. Old, the Institute physician at
VMI, reported yesterday that there
was an “increased number of respt-
ratory infections” at VMI, but added
that this was “usual at this time of
year.” He stated, “We haven't had
anything that resembles Hong Kong
flu.”

The Dean of Students at Randolph-
Macon, explaining the reasons for
that school’s closing, said, “We were
having girls develop symptoms, and
the doctor decided that it would be
best to get the girls out, “The symp-
toms were not definitely certified as

partment in Richmond, but they seem

result from a student's conviction before the Ex-
ecutive Committee and the implementation of his
right for a public hearing as a result of his conviction

it is completely run by the students

The second committee appointed by Passavant will
review the jurisdictional limits of the Honor System
It will study and evaluate existing policies with regard
to such matters as off-campus or out of university com-
munity offenses, offenses during vacations, pranks, or
in any case where applicability of the Honor System is
in question

The purpose of this committee is to establish a re
ferable framework so that decisions can be made with
repeated consistency. It is not to be interpreted as a
codification of the honor system, but as the establish-
ment of guidelines in unclear situations.

Serving on this committee will be secretary of the
student body Judson Simmons and newly-elected fresh

Honor System Revisions

The time has come for all of us to look into modifications |
and clarifications for the Washington and Lee Honor System.
This will have to be a job for all students, not just members
of the Executive Committee and the faculty. As pointed out
in Bill Walker’s article, W&L men have governed their lives |
by this system for a hundred years.

With this in mind, we are presenting for your considera-
tion at this time three suggestions which we feel should be
included in the Honor System. These suggestions will be taken
separately to the Executive Committee Monday night for that
body’s approval, with the ultimate aim of having them in-
cluded as amendments to the Student Body Constitution. With
the EC’s approval, over fifty per cent of all the members of
the student body must vote in favor of each of them in order
for them to be accepted.

According to the Student Body Constitution, the Honor
System is mentioned only twice. The first time the Honor
System is mentioned is in Article III (Duties of Officers),
Section C (Secretary), Paragraph 2: The Secretary of the
Student Body “shall keep accurate records of the proceedings
and evidence in Honor System cases and shall cause type-
written copies of the same to be recorded in the Honor System
Record Book.”

The second instance the Honor System is mentioned is
Section V (Duties and Powers of the Executive Committee) ,
Section B and C: The Executive Committee “shall have sole
jurisdiction in every Honor System case. Each case shall be
conducted in accordance with the Honor System Procedure
as stated. It shall see that the Honor System is carefully and
thoroughly explained to the entire Student Body at the be-
ginning of every session and shall provide access to all new
students and new faculty members a copy of both the Consti-
tution, including the explanation of the Honor System, and
the Procedure for Honor System cases.”

The point we wish to emphasize is that nowhere in the
Constitution are there any rights which are guaranteed to the
students. At the Bitch-In and at the public trial it was stated

 

that the Constitution guarantees the right of appeal for all stu-

Che Ring-tum Phi
ridau

dents. This is not true. The only rights which are delineated
are contained in the Honor System practices written by the
President of the Student Body. This may be found in the
Student Handbook. The President of the Student Body, Jay
Passavant, claimed that this does not change from year to
year. In fact, the statements on the Honor System written
by Richard Nash in 1967 and by Passavant this year cor-
respond word for word. However, since this statement is
supposedly written by the President, there is nothing which
says he cannot change it.

The amendments which will be proposed will not only
guarantee the rights of the students, but will also enumerate
rights set by the precedent in past honor cases. The pro-
posals are as follows:

1. All students possess the right of appeal at a Student
Body hearing after Executive Committee conviction. This
right of appeal is not now mentioned in the Constitution,
although it has been recognized by precedent,

2. A Student must be given notification 24 hours in
advance of the trial before the Executive Committee of the
charges against him and his rights in an honor proceed-
ing. Presently, the student does not know he has been
charged with a violation of the Honor System until mem-
bers of the EC “knock on his door.” In the meantime, the
EC has all the time it wants to prepare its case. In addition,
the student is under undue emotional stress and pressure
under these circumstances. This could very well lead to
misunderstanding or confusion on the student’s part which
would call into question the validity of his testimony as
evidence.

3. A Student must be permitted to construct his own

 

 

The Honor System Is A Failure ¢

(This is the first in a three-part
series of articles on the Honor

study the system's faults and sug-
gest methods to improve it.

This first article was composed

as the president of Washington Col-

and Lee gentleman was, to a high
degree, both meaningful and realistic.

larity between its article and this
one is purely coincidental.)

For one hundred years, Washing-
ton and Lee men have tried to govern
their individual and student lives by
what we know simply as the Honor
System. The excellence of the system
has seldom been challenged, and its
form has survived practically with-
out change. The system purports to
define both social and judicial stand-
ards of conduct, the former im-
plicitly, and the latter explicitly. After
four years of life under the Honor
System, I sincerely feel that it fails,
in both areas, to fulfill its purpose.

I do not doubt that a _hundred

is our generation, in fact, seems to
be effecting the greatest change in
social as well as legal concepts. There
are not many Washington Lee men
in 1968 who even try to conform to
the social ideals which have long
been an integral part of our Honor
System as a whole. What would
General Lee have thought of men
who, in practice, condone drunkeness,
who find amusement in “dumping
on dates,” and who pride themselves
on their sexual promiscuity? I have
litthe doubt that he would have found
such practices damnable. Obviously,
if our daily social conduct may be
taken as a common denominator for
our beliefs and ideals, we do not.

 

Mock OAS Planned

By JORGE ESTRADA
At many universities one of the
events which draws the highest level
of student involvement every year is
a simulation of a political, national

or international, organization. This
is evidenced by mock UN Security
Councils, such as the one at Hollins

Mock Convention
recently held here at WAl
However, the before mentioned
events differ significantly in character
While our Mock Convention, held
every four years, is concerned only
with the national scene and limited
to the selection of a presidential
candidate, the mock UNSCs held at
various schools are annual events in
volving international problems of a
wider scope. We think it is time for
Washington and Lee students to be
come involved in this wider scope
We hereby propose to undertake the

College, and the

establishment of a Mock Organiza-
tion of American States to be held
this spring.

The OAS is a regional organization,
whose members are nations of the
Western Hemisphere exclusive of
Cuba and Canada, that has priority
over the United Nations as far as
solving inter-American problems. The
Cuban and the Dominican Republic
crises are examples of cases handled
by the OAS

\ Mock OAS would entail the
representation of 24 universities. Each
delegation would represent a country
member of the OAS and would be
fully prepared to act legitimate
spokesman for that country. A key-
note speaker, possibly the actual
Secretary-General of the OAS, will
open a two-day session, The repre-
sentatives will then proceed to present

case before the Executive Committee at trial proceedings.
This should include confronting his accusers and calling
his own witnesses. As the situation now stands, the Executive
Committee is called upon to function as prosecution, de-
fense, judge and jury. It is questionable whether any man
can function adequately in the simultaneous performance
of all these roles. It would seem that something would neces-
sarily be slighted—possibly the defense. This seems out of
joint in a system which supposedly works upon the credo that
a man is innocent until proven guilty.

These are the proposed amendments. We feel they are
needed to guarantee due process in honor cases. We know
that other students here are also concerned about this, as
evidenced in a recent Forensic Union debate which ended up
by rejecting the present system because it deprives one of due
process. In the Forensic Union debate, the question of the
ultimate penalty also came into question.

We do not intend to beg you to care about your Honor
System. But if it does mean something to you and you wish
it to remain a strong and workable force on campus, then
we feel you are obligated to see that its weaknesses are ironed
out. This entails either suggesting other proposals or sup-
porting as strongly as possible the ones which we have just
suggested.

This is your Honor System. It can be strengthened only
by your support and interest. This is too important an issue
to be ignored.

Thanks To Committee

The Tuesday editorial thanked the faculty for approving
a five-day week. We also would like to thank the faculty, but
in particular the faculty committee which labored so hard to
come up with an acceptable plan.

The members of this committee, Messrs. E. B. Hamer,
O. S. McGuire, R. W. Royston and J. D. Cook, are to be
commended. At times their operations were slowed down be-
cause of confusion resulting from certain complex points.
But in the end they came through. As far as we are con-
cerned, that’s all that really counts. |

Washington and Lee's cagers,

Wrestlers Bow
To Towson State

Towson State brought a talented
group of wrestlers to Doremus Gym-
nasium last Friday night to spoil the

debut of the Washington and Lee
grapplers, 29-11. The score might
have been worse except for a fine

showing by the home team’s heavier
men.

Towson jumped off to a 29-0 lead
with victories in every weight class
from 123 to 167. Freshman Buzzy
White was pinned in the third period
by Bruce McCurrin for the visitors.
Co-captain Razz Rasberry lost a de-
cision to Dale Hutchinson and Wes
Pullman was pinned by Dan Griffin
for Towson in the second period.
Bruce Hankins, wrestling at 145 for
the Generals, couldn’t catch the early
lead built by his opponent, Bob New-
ton, and lost a _ decision while
Brent Hankins lost on a fall in the
i first period to Ray Grosykowski.

Dave Higgins lost on points 8-1 to
Harold White of the visitors and
Clarke Carter became the seventh
| straight General victim, suffering a
| second period pin to Bob Hansen of
| Towson. However, the weight classes
|from 177 to heavyweight belong to
the Generals’ trio of Dan Webster,
freshman Jim Hooker, and co-captain
| Jay Clarke.

Webster began the process of sal-
| vaging the Generals’ pride by de-
| stroying his man, Darrell Freels.
| Aggressive and in command all the

 

 

| way, Webster picked up five points
by winning by default, as an in-
jury forced Freels to the sidelines

Jim Hooker picked up where Webster
left off. completely dominating Tow-
son's Bill Harper for a 9-0 decision,
hiking the total for the home team to
eight.

Senior Jay Clarke completed the
comeback with a brilliant 3-0 win in
a David and Goliath match. Clarke's
opponent, Dave Nicoli, had a defi-
nite edge in size over the WAI
captain, but the quickness and the
know-how of Clarke brought home
| the victory and made the final score
| 29-11.
| Coach Miller had special praise for
| Webster and Clarke. He said that
the win by Clarke was the “smart-

ever wrestled. The aggressiveness of

monwealth University. Although the |
Rams took 100 shots from the|
floor, the Generals led the entire |
game in winning 83-70. What won |
for the Generals was their superiority |
at the foul line. This was the weak-
est part of last year’s team and it
appears that no longer will the Gen-
erals be held up to ridicule for inept
foul shooting. Forty-seven times the
Generals paraded to the free throw
line and 33 times the ball went
through the hoop. Although VCU
managed six more field goals than
W&L, the Generals’ newly-found
ability to convert free throws brought
them victory.

Stuart Fauber finished with
points, including 12 of 13 from the
charity stripe. Mike Neer followed

Opening with a full court press, the

in racing to a 61-27 halftime lead.
The Generals cooled off in the sec-

considerable action. The final score
ended up 96-60, as Mel Cartwright
led all scorers with 24 points. Cart-
wright was taken out after his 24th
point and presented with the game
ball. His 24th point was also the

to attend meetings.

The points emphasized by Sandler and Turnbull
were to sponsor other “Bitch-In’s” which have specific
topics; dispel the feeling of secrecy which students
attribute to the EC; encourage ideas directly from the
students (Turnbull said, “Minutes are being distributed
now and students know what's going on, but they
still don’t bring ideas.”); publicize more fully that the
EC is open to the public; and have EC members
write articles in the newspaper expressing their own
ideas and those of the EC,

Passavant asked Sandler and Simmons to lay down
as many specific solutions as possible and report back
at a later meeting.

Student Civil Liberties Committee

Jack Horowitz, chairman of the Student Civil Lib-
erties Committee, asked the EC for permission to have
Pleas Geyer assist him in the operations of his commit-
tee. Other members of the committee will be chosen at
the EC’s next meeting Monday night. All those interest-
ed in joining the committee must submit letters of
intent to Judson Simmons no later than 6 p.m, Sunday.
Interviews will be held Monday night beginning at
7:15, Six to eight members will be selected. This num-
ber includes the EC represenetative Turnbull.

Passavant stated that the duties of the SCLC would
be to determine what rights the students have when
they come in contact with standing committees in any
situations that would lead to the EC, Cold Check Com-
mittee, Publications Board and Student Control Com-
mittee. Various questions to be posed will include the
authority of various deans and the rights of appeal or
dissent of the students. The eventual goal of this com-
mittee is to arrive at a “Bill of Rights” for students
to be amended to the student body constitution and

Studies Honor System

to be approved by the faculty in an effort to insure
the rights of the individual.
Further Student Representation
Passavant announced that the president of the stu-
dent body or some other representative of the EC will
be given time at the beginning of each faculty meeting
to deliver a report of issues being dealt with by that

body and any action being pursued by the EC. Com- |
ments and suggestions will be accepted in an effort to)

improve effective communications between students and
faculty.

In addition, he added that a proposal to have an
EC representative on the faculty executive committee
is pending.

Mock OAS Session

Jorge Estrada, senior student from Medellin, Co-
lombia, asked for money from the EC to finance a
mock Organization of American States session at Wash-
ington and Lee next spring. He asked for $500 for this
project. It was decided that the EC could not now
affoird to finance it entirely. However, Leonard will
meet with Estrada this week to determine means for
financing.

Leonard reported that the student tax of $650 plus
the interest on the Student Body Reserve Fund (interest
is collected from bond investments and two real estate
loans and amounts to about $500 yearly) make up the
working fund for the whole year. He emphasized that
any money taken from the reserve fund, which cur-
rently approximates $98000, would lower the interest
received on it.

In the final business of the evening, Ron Kessler,
interim Mock Convention chairman, reported that many
bills owed May’s Mock Convention have not been paid.
The EC will check with those people who still owe
money

resolutions concerning — problems,
either factual or hypothetical which
face the American nations; these prob-
| lems will be of a political, militaristic,
} or economic nature.

The participating schools will be
selected from applications sent from
approximately 60 eastern colleges.
There will be nearly 70 delegates, in-
cluding faculty members who will
act as political advisors, to house and
feed. The sessions will be held in
Doremus Gymnasium. Expenses will
include cost of mailing and paper
work, room and board, and a closing
social event.

To accomplish this, we need strong
student body support. The initiators
of this idea, Jorge Estrada and
Thomas Blanton, and the original sup-
porters, the Friday Ring-tum Phi and
the Political Science and International
Relations Club, have received an en-
thusiastic response from both faculty
and students. Miss Judy Tompkins
(organizer and Secretary General of
the Randolph-Macon Mock Security
Council), John Motsinger (president
of the PSIRC), and Jorge Estrada ap-
pealed to the EC for financial aid.
Even though strong support was given
to the idea, the EC did not feel it
was prepared to act immediately.
However, Student Body Vice-Presi-
dent Danny Leonard, was commis-
sioned ot meet with Estrada to discuss
the matter further. There will be
a report on a meeting with Dean
Atwood and President Huntley
soon as possible.

The Beatles? Satire?

(Continued from Page 2)

Che Beatles have humility, they don’t
trust opinions, All they wanted to
do was record a lot of songs about
music.

What's more, most of the songs
are funny. If not funny, then they're
affectionate, sharp, or ironic—some-
times all four, as in “Honey Pie.” It’s
had to put that in an article in Time.

For example, take “Back in the
USSR,” the first cut, which appears
to parody the Beach Boys. But only
the middle section sounds like them.
Either the parody’s a failure or the
song’s attempting something else. Al-
though Newsweek says exactly six-
teen of the songs are parodies, very
few stand this kind of examination.

Look at the songs as essays in
musical form. Take “Piggies.” We all
know that reformers often become
intolerant and bitter—for example,
the Puritans, or the Maoists of “Rev-
olution.” Mightn’t a reformist song
become petulant and quarrelsome?
So “Piggies” declines from a kind of
arch-irony to a petty desire that
“they” all get spanked.

Again, “soul music” can be virile
love or brute sensuality. If brute, it
might lack subtlety. The album con-
tains a couple of astonishing examples.

The Beatles turn this critical ap-
proach on themselves. Ringo’s song,
the ponderously warm “Don't Pass
Me By,” contains (intentionally) the
worst country music arrangement
ever recorded—an organ, fiddle, and
drums: the night we all fell asleep
at the barn dance. “Glass Onion,”
as everyone knows, announces that
Paul is the walrus. Believe it or not.

A characteristic of music is to
captivate the feelings. This is always
dangerous to some extent. The Beatles
are right hard on viviousness; but they
keep perspective. They have a nag-
ging fondness for songs with nice
feelings, even the utterly sentimental
“Good Night.”

All the styles of songs in this album
are familiar to us; our age group
especially has gone through school
with them. The Beatles draw out
their implications and make us ac-
cept our responsibility for the part
of us that they are.

By ROBERT 5S. JOHNSON
Faculty Contributor

A staff editorial in The Tuesday
Ring-tum Phi of November 19 seems
to have gone, if not unnoticed, un-
challenged. The editorial, entitled
“The faculty as a legislature,” sug-
gests that (1) the faculty has some-
what brazenly assumed authority over
areas of University life where it has
none and (2) the decision-making
apparatus of the faculty is not up
to the tasks confronting it. To remedy
this it is proposed that policy be made
by the president alone or that de-
cisions be made by considerably less
than the full faculty in whose cur-
rent monthly meetings differences of
Opinion tend to intrude and impede.

R. W. K., the author, has asked for
my reaction. It is one of virtually
total disagreement. The faculty is and
it seems to me, ought to remain the
fundamental shaper of university life.

The by-laws of our university make
it abundantly clear that the faculty's
scope of authority and responsibility
is wide:

The Faculty shall be responsible
for the academic regulation of stu-
dents, for entrance and graduation
requirements, for the approval and
supervision of courses of study, for
the recommendation of stuednts for
degrees, and for the discipline and
government of the students and all
student organizations. (sec.2, ch.
IV, University By-Laws.)

So it cannot be disputed that the
faculty does have authority in mat-
ters such as fraternity affairs, cur-
riculum revision, and the five-day
week, to cite those topics mentioned
in the editorial,

Should the faculty have _ this
authority? One can argue that his-
torically a university and its faculty
were thought of as one, so that the
faculty today remains the dominant
force on a campus. Granted, discus-
sion and final resolution of every non-
routine matter by the full faculty is
at times less than efficient. The al-
ternatives proposed in the editorial—
one-man rule (by the president) and
rule by an all-powerful committee of
faculty and administration elite—
would function smoothly and rapidly.

“Should not the president of the
university be given absolute authority
to construct a unified plan of cur-
riculum in line with his theories of
the liberal arts college?” asks R.W.K.,
presumably to avoid a faculty debate
certain to be lengthy. Examples of
colleges so run, while fortunately
not abundant, do exist, Let us pass
over the obvious one (Bob Jones
University) and consider Parsons Col-
lege whose curriculum was (before
loss of accreditation) the creation of
its president. The result was not the
envy of the academic world. More to
the point the violent disorder at many
reputable institutions in recent years
has been, in the views of many ob-
servers, the result of questionable ad-
ministrative decisions on curriculum
and other matters in which the fac-
ulty was denied any meaningful role.
While | am not suggesting that a
curriculum devised by our President
would be bad, it seems clear that this

sort of administrative rule ought to
be shunned,

Turning to the other alternative
proposed, ought not the faculty dele-
gate its authority to a committee of
thirty or so whose decisions would
be final? Or, should committee re-
ports be accepted automatically?
Since the size of our faculty does not
make either an absolute necessity,
the answer again is clearly no. A
committee of any legislative body can
be easily dominated by a minority
whose thinking is no where in tune
with a majority of the legislators.
(Examples abound in the congress.)
Such may not be the case here, but
on any faculty it can happen that,
no matter how conscientious and
scrupulous a committee is, its  re-
port does not turn out to be the
embodiment of the faculty will. And

University hosts
mock session of

OAS in March

A mock session of the Organiza-
tion of American States will be held
at Washington and Lee University,
March 14-15, 1969, according to
Jorge Estrada, Secretary-General of
the Model OAS.

The simulation will be of the Inter-
American Conference, the highest
legislative body of the OAS. Invita-
tions will be sent to 60 colleges and
universities to send delegates to repre-
sent each of the 23 members of
the Conference and one _ interested
party (Canada). Each delegation will
represent the foreign policy of one
country in the organization in a
manner similar to the representation
of states in the W&L Mock Con-
vention.

Interested students at Washington
and Lee will be attached to each
delegation as accredited envoys. Stu-
dents here will study the policy of the
state to which he will be attached
from material available from the em-
bassies and from the Council on In-
ternational Relations and United
Nations Affairs in New York.

Other student positions are open
on the Social Committee (for the
social event) and the General Services
and Administrative Committees. A
meeting of all students interested in
any positions on the OAS simulation
will be held in Howe 206, Wednes-
day, Dec. 18, at 9:00 p.m.

The program is sponsored by Wash-
ington and Lee University along with
the Political Science Club and the
Tuesday and Friday Ring-tum Phis.

A tentative agenda calls for a key-
note address by the present Secretary-
General of the OAS followed by
plenary sessions on Friday and Satur-
day.

Service at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity will take place at the R. E.
Lee Memorial Episcopal Church to-
morrow night at 8 o'clock.

The special service is held each year
for both the University and the
Lexington community. It consists of
nine Biblical readings by nine mem-
bers of the Washington and Lee
faculty, administration and student
body. Christmas carols are also sung
by both the WAL Glee Club and
those aitending the service.

Before the program begins, the
University’s John A. Graham Brass
Choir will give a performance.

EC may vote to alter exam

scheduling; OAS given $50

Flexible exam schedules gained the; 24, through Sunday, June 1, after

initial support of the Executive Com-
mittee in its last meeting before the
Christmas holidays. Staman Ogilvie
reported the suggestions of an EC
sub-committee composed of himself
and Bill Brown, and said the tenta-
tive proposals would be presented to
the EC for its vote of recommenda-
tion to the faculty at a later meeting.

The EC was also told that the
faculty Executive Committee 1) would
recommend to the faculty at its Janu-
ary meeting that one non-voting mem-
ber of the EC be allowed to sit with
the faculty group, and 2) indicated
it was willing to meet on a monthly
basis with the student EC for a gen-
eral interchange of ideas. The EC
was also willing.

There was lengthy debate concern-
ing three proposed Constitutional
amendments advocated by The Fri-
day Ring-tum Phi and brought to
the EC by Ron Kessler. One was
dropped; two were defeated. In other
business, the EC 1) granted a request
from Jorge Estrada that his group
forming the Mock OAS be appropri-
ated $50 for initial expenses, 2)
selected members for the new Stu-
ident Civil Liberties Committee, and
| 3) announced the student member-
| ship on the University Committee on
Intercollegiate Athletics (Gary Silver-
field was re-appointed; Drew Kum-
puris was appointed).

Exam schedule

Rob Bauer, Pete Hendricks, and
Danny Leonard were absent as the
EC heard Ogilvie’s recommendations
for pre-scheduled exam conditions
which the EC will probably soon
endorse for adoption on a trial basis
next semester.

Although Brown emphasized the
suggestions were “still in rough
form,” there was no dearth of sup-
porting evidence that the ideas were
in good use elsewhere (Mary Baldwin,
Hollins, and Randolph-Macon being
the schools mentioned which the EC
had consulted).

The system would work something
like this: each student, several weeks
before exams next spring, would indi-
cate on a card the days on which
he desired to take each of his ex-
aminations.

Exams would be given in a nine-
day period following a reading day
after the end of classes. The exam
period would be from Saturday, May

which professors would have four
days to grade the exams.

Ogilvie made it clear that students
could not change their exam periods
at will, but only in the prescribed
time a few weeks before the end of
classes. Exams, under the proposed
schedule, would be given in three
time slots each day (except Sunday,
when there would be two periods),

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion Of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Student Newspaper
Tuesday, December 17, 1968

 

We are not dealing with a ‘failure’

Honor is relative—and in these times its
definition is elusive and its range undefined.
It is this very nature which makes it impossible
to legislate against dishonor; honor and dis-
honor, integrity and the lack of integrity,
morality and immorality—who can delineate
the differences?

At Washington and Lee, tradition has
delegated the authority of maintaining the
wholly elusive quality of honor to the student
body through its Executive Committee. It has
been, is now, and will continue to be the feel-
ing of many that legislation against dishonor
in this community of fifteen hundred is not
only possible but is desirable as well. Few
temporize in honor’s favor by discussing re-
habilitative aspects: no contrition is tolerated
under the absolute penalty.

No, the general reasoning in support of
our honor system is that it affords protection
—competitive situations in the classroom are
guaranteed fairness; a student’s word is taken
without reservation; and the incidental con-
fidence in leaving apartments unlocked or
books in the quad is truly a luxury.

* ok

Due process?

At this juncture enter the critics. Some,
such as Mr. Kessler of The Friday Ring-tum
Phi, wish to amend the current honor system
by including certain due process provisions
now operative in governmental courts of law.
Perhaps these are necessary. As one of the
more competent members of the Executive
Committee, Pete Hendricks, said, some of the
honor trial procedures are legal travesties;
but Mr. Hendricks went on to point out that
Washington and Lee is a closed, private com-
munity which may govern itself almost en-
tirely as it wishes. If the procedure for trial
were to be legalized, then, would the honor
system be strengthened?

We think not. As Steve Sandler said, any-
one, given time, could make a successful bid
for acquittal on almost any honor violation
trial—guilty or innocent. The honor system’s
strength on this campus lies largely rooted in
awe (or fear) of the Executive Committee.

* *
Codified jurisdiction?

Then there are those critics who bemoan the
lack of defined limits for the EC’s jurisdic-
tion; a legitimate complaint. But how is this
to be resolved? If the EC states that its juris-
diction will encompass only the campus and
immediate environs, what if some W&L stu-
dents are caught stealing money at the Uni-
versity of Virginia? Or cheating in summer

school? On the other hand, if the EC assumes

The proposal made by Jorge Estrada et.
al. that Washington and Lee initiate and
host a mock Organization of American States
is met here with mixed feelings. The idea
behind Mr. Estrada’s purpose is surely a
noble one, that students may become more
knowledgeable about the workings of such
organizations as the OAS (and Mr. Estrada
indicated he would like to change the group
under study each year) and more aware of
international problems, We, too, will support
his efforts in this regard; who are we to stand
in the way of those who would widen narrow
vistas? * ‘

Requesting all the budget

Unfortunately, the situation is not quite so
black-and-white. Mr. Estrada has asked the
Executive Committee to appropriate $500 to
$600 for his endeavor. Now we do not intend
to discuss the flux of student body funds—
they are overseen, incidentally, by Danny
Leonard, who has demonstrated his fiscally-
sound discretion in handling those funds.

But such a request is indeed ridiculous,
especially in light of the fact that no W&L
student will be allowed to represent a country.

limitless jurisdiction, would they in fact dis-
miss a student for stealing a parking sign
at Hollins? Or lying to a Draft Board in
Chicago?

There are many who see the honor system
as something it is not, who see it as what
they imagine it to be. Some assume it is
entirely idealistic, upholding the greatest of
all virtues. Others envision its role as com-
pletely pragmatic, a convenient and hand-
some backdrop for those not “aware” enough
to accept the protection rationale.

To us, it is a mixture of both, a quixotic.
romantic yet stringently durable code which
sets this University’s 1,438 students and 12,-
000 alumni on a proud pedestal of self-
regulated integrity.

* *

Coincidental or damnable?

And thus it was somewhat disquieting for
us to read in The Friday Ring-tum Phi, under
a rather large headline proclaiming “The
Honor System Is A Failure,” that “This first
article was composed before The Tuesday
Ring-tum Phi was printed this week. Any
similarity between its article and this one is
purely coincidental.”

Damnable would be a better word. For the
honor system is not a failure; indeed, its
strength will be enhanced as transient weak-
nesses are worked out among the Executive
Committee. We thoroughly agree with Mr.
Kessler, who wrote last Friday:

We do not intend to beg you to care about your
Honor System. But if it does mean something to you
and you wish it to remain a strong and workable
force on campus, then we feel you are obligated to
see that its weaknesses are ironed out....

This is your Honor System. It can be strengthened
only by your support and interest. This is too im-
portant an issue to be ignored.

It is for those and other reasons this edi-
tion called for Mr. Kessler’s resignation. And
it is for those reasons this edition refuses
to call the honor system a failure. Its imple-
mentation may fall short of success; certainly
it is entirely consistent with this edition’s
editorial policy to make that statement. Our
request is that the Executive Committee set
for itself the conditions under which it will
judge a question of honor, and further that
the twelve gentlemen set for themselves the
criteria which constitute a violation.

* *

Jury of our peers?

The men of the EC are not our peers;
they are, by their election to that position,
our leaders in questions of honor. We call
upon them to exercise their power by decid-
ing how the system shall be enforced, and
then, most importantly, to so enforce this

Randolph-Macon’s authority on mock events
Miss Tompkins tried to convince the EC that
there would be involvement by students here
since “several hundred would be doing re-
search on the 24 countries, to be used by

the various delegations.”
* ’

Not many will volunteer

We challenge Miss Tompkins to find sev-
eral hundred W&L students who will be will-
ing, on their own (i.¢., not as a requirement
for a course), to research data on a country,
hand it over to someone from another col-
lege, sit by as these people have all the fun,
and then applaud the EC’s alloting student
body funds for the affair.

We are not condemning Mr. Estrada or
his idea; we are, however, suggesting that
funds for the simulated convention could be
secured from other sources—from the de-
partments which would likely be interested,
such as political science and history, or per-
haps by raising the required registration fees
paid by participating colleges. It is too good
an idea to be dropped because of a lack of
money, but it allows too narrow a participa.
tion to debit student body funds,

 

Horowitz blasts EC

but defends some members and ideas

By JACK HOROWITZ

Washington Hall is one of those].

nerve center type buildings from
which the world is run. President
Huntley’s suite of offices is there.
You pay your money to the treasurer
and you take your chances there.
Your application for admission is
favorably received there and if your
connections are ever severed, I guess
that happens there too,

It is from the top floor of Wash-
ington Hall that this year’s Executive
Committee operates. Almost every
Monday night, sometime around 7:15
p.m.—after “Goodnight David; Good-
night Chet: and Goodnight for NBC
news” has spoonfed America the news
of the day—another meeting of the
Executive Committe is gaveled to
order by Student Body President Jay
Passavant.

In the third floor history seminar
room this elected group of select men
sit to ponder the problems of the past
and to legislate against the problems
of the future. A history seminar
room: the Congress of Vienna is dis-
cussed during the daylight hours and
when evening comes it is acted out.

Every attempt is made by the ad-
ministration to the University to im-
press upon “us students” that Wash-
ington and Lee is more than just
classroom activity. Those before-
dawn 8:25s and the seminars that
run till dinner time are not meant
to be the limits to learning at W&L.
The Mock convention gives students
the opportunity to feel the real-life
despair that results from political
activity. Student Newspapers, maga-
zines, yearbooks provide a wealth of
experience for the participating stu-
dents. Contact is a means of taking
the ideas born in the classroom and
seeing how they live and die in the
real world. The W&L catalogue tells
us that the university has recognized
for years the contribution to student
life made by participatory student gov-
ernment.

But the catalogue also warns us
against mistakenly assuming that
learning is a passive process. In some
of the finest catalogue prose we are
reminded:

It should be remembered, however,
that the burden of responsibility
in higher education is not the col-
lege’s alone. Few, if any, of the
processes of learning take place
automatically for a student in col-
lege. The young man (that’s us)
must recognize and accept his re-
sponsibility to take maximum ad-
vantage of the opportunity offered
there. (Ihat’s here!)

Participation, plus

So, the Executive Committee is in
part to give us the opportunity to be-
come involved in the legislative and
hopefully the democratic process that
is America, In addition, the Executive
Committee deals with very relevent
issues: issues that affect student life
on campus. The EC worked for a
five day week. Now that is past. The
EC is working for an open exam
schedule. This is now present. The
question is the future. A_ totally
integrated academic community with-
in an integrated geographical setting
might be next, although it is against
tradition, The Honor trial procedure
may be revamped. The EC may be
split into an executive honor council
and a legislative body,

Participation in high school stu-
dent governments was for your col-
lege record. Participation here is for
the life you want to lead now that
you are here...

Most students at Washington and
Lee would like the liberty to live a
free and worthwhile life. Liberty is
traditional too! But like a club tie
or “gold cup” socks, it has its price.
Liberty has been on sale in Vir-
ginia before; Thomas Jefferson long
ago: “The price of liberty is eternal
vigilance.” And | do not think he
meant Anti-Ballistic Missle systems.

Vigilance means participation. . .

To participate efficiently one must
be educated and enlightened .. .

There's that catalogue again!

Jefferson had some things to say
about the role of those who govern
as well; “I know of no safe de-
pository of the ultimate powers of
the society but the people themselves;
and if we think them not enlightened
enough to exercise their control with
a wholesome discretion. the remedy
is not to take it from them, but to
inform their discretion.”

Who needs a microphone?

Hut when the EC can look around
its meeting room and see very few
imterested students, they fee! justified
in chuckling about their future meet-
ing room in the new student union

Ray Hartwell
has second thoughts

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

While I deplore the action of Mr.
Kessler in not acknowledging the
source of his editorial, I must with-
draw my endorsement of the peti-
tion calling for his resignation. It is,
I suppose, appropriate that I mention
my reasons for this decision. The most
important ones follow.

Firstly, | was not fully aware of the
ruling of the Publications Board at
the time of my signing, either in re-
spect to Mr. Kessler or to Mr. Honig.
Secondly, while deploring Mr. Kes-
sler’s action, I could not help but
be repulsed by the “lynch-mob” fash-
ion in which the petition was used.

Insofar as the Honor System is
concerned, any reevaluation must be
conducted (or at least instigated) by
the Executive Committee. To chal-
lenge the decisions of the E.C. con-
cerning the Honor System (outside of
channels provided) is to undermine
that System.

Is legality necessary?

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

Having come to Washington and
Lee from a university where an honor
system was non-existent if was a
significant change to enter a situa-
tion where cheating was not a way
of life, where petty thievery was not
rampant, and where the only credit
reference a man needed was his
word. Accordingly | read with some
apprehension the remarks of both
Mr. Hendricks and Mr. Walker con-
cerning a reevaluation of the honor
system.

The honor trial itself may contain
some of the obvious trappings of a
trial at law but, however, any analogy
should cease there, The attempt to
place upon the system any more of
these can do no more than burden
the honor system and those who ad-
minister it with a pseudo-bureaticratic

maize of regulations, guidelines, and

warnings that must be administered
before a question of a breech of
honor can be settled, And to apply
Mr. Hendrick’s warnings, which bear
more than a passing resemblance to
those handed down in Miranda vy,
Arizona, 384 U.S, 436 (1966), is to
prostitute the system to needless
change for change’s sake. Adding to
the seeming confusion that already
exists within the honor system by al-
tempting to apply United States
Supreme Court rulings, whose own
basis in the law is somewhat quest
ionable, is no way to strengthen the
sysiem for the future, It is instead
the way to stifle its very life in the
present

Generals trounce Guilford
in raucous Doremus upset

By JOHN ROBINSON
and JEFF CARPER

Last night a strong Guilford Col-
lege basketball team invaded Doremus
Gymnasium only to be stunned by
WAL 94-76. Washington and Lee
showed the explosive offense and
tenacious defense that has won them
six straight victories. The Generals
played their best game to date ap-
propriately against their toughest
opponent to date.

On Saturday, the cagers defeated
visiting North Carolina Methodist in
a game which wasn’t nearly so close
as the score, 80-72, indicated. How-
ever, this definitely couldn't be con-
strued as one of the Generals better
games. Play was often sloppy on both
sides and there were only sporadic
moments when the Blue looked sharp.

At first the going was easy for the
Generals and by the end of the first
half the Blue held a commanding
50-31 edge. Employing a full court

 

games.

press early in the game, the Generals
were able to force some Methodist
turnovers and convert them to bas-
kets. Mel Cartwright put in three driv-
ing layups in pacing the Generals’
early spurt, scoring 18 points in the
first half,

The second half was a completely
different story. It was perhaps the
worst twenty minutes of play that
WAL has put forth this year. The
Blue lost the ball on numerous turn-
overs and watched their lead gradu-
ally dissipate before a steady Metho-
dist onslaught. Although W&L used
a variety of defenses, they were un-
able to stop visiting center Jim Darden
who threw in 24 points in the second
stanza, mostly from right underneath
the basket. Complementing him were
Methodist forwards Roy Henderson
and Tom Bell who sank some occas-
ional outside shots. With 6:30 re-
maining on the clock, N.C.M. had
closed the gap to 69-63. Charlie Stone

 

Sounding off .. .

Minks deafen

By ROY CARLTON

There necessarily comes a_ time
when every writer must eat a little
crow. Right now I'm eating it, but
1 couldn't be happier. In my first
column of the year, | took to task
the WAL student for his apathy in
the opening football game against
Guilford. Time has come for a fe-
traction,

Last night, Mink sports fans proved
how devoted they could be as they
disassembled Guilford almost as badly
as the Generals did down on the
floor, The number of standing ova-
tions they gave their team defies
counting. And, for the first time with-
in memory, they completely drowned
out the Quakers’ girl cheerleaders
with an unbelievable chorus of boos.
Gone was any detachment from the
game. The Minks felt for their team.

After that 20-5 season two years
ago, WAL rooters began to develop
an apathy toward winning just as
bad as the one they'd had toward
losing. They rarely cheered for their
team, instead they spent most of
their time riding the opposing squad,
Last night they found the best of
both worlds. Coach Jerry Steele of
Guilford took an amazing amount
of razzing, yet the screams for the
Blue were even louder, Groups of
students felt no restraint at all in
getting up and leading cheers

If anything, a rivalry seems to be

loudest. The Delis occupying the east

stands led most of the cheers, while |

the SPE’s in the balcony above them
held fast to their title as the rowdiest
fans.

Make no mistake, the crowd had
a great deal to do with the win.
The home court advantage they gave
the Generals was immeasurable. The
Quakers couldn't help but be shaken,
nor could it have failed to hearten
the Blue.

Guilford’s loss last night was the
worst they have suffered in three
years. Before last night, they were
nationally ranked, A pair of victories
Thursday and Friday nights in the
WAL Invitational Tournament would
bring the Generals’ record to 8-1,
Under those circumstances, it is hard
to imagine Washington and Lee not
picking up some votes in next week's
small college rankings. It may be
that the Blue are finally headed to
their long-anticipated NCAA bid, but
a lot still lies in the future, like
Navy. In the meantime, the fans can
do their share toward helping by
putting on more shows like last night.

sophomore Bill Rhyne drew three
fouls and coolly tossed in four of
five attempts to kill the Methodist

threat as time ran out,

W&L had only two more goals
than North Carolina, but made a
blistering 18 of 20 foul shots. Mel
Cartwright led W&L with 5 points
while Charlie Stone and Mike Neer
added 17 and 16 points respectively.
Cartwright, Neer, and Mike Daniels
helped the Generals to hold an ad-
vantage over N.C. in rebounds. Jim
Darden played an outstanding sec-
ond half, ending up with 36 points
for the night to pace N.C.

Last year Guilford was nationally
ranked in small colleges and had one
of the nation’s most potent offenses.
The Quakers not only have a hot
run and gun offense but also have
good height with a back line of 6-6,
6-6, and 6-3 with boys 6-10 and 6-8
in reserve.

In the first half teamwork was the
key to success as WAL jumped out
to a 39-34 lead. The Generals moved
the ball well while Guilford was
plagued with turnovers. The tough
defense by WAL stopped Guilford’s
lightning fast break and forced them
to work for good shots. Stu Fauber
and Norwood Morrison were hot
from the outside as Mel Cartwright
and Mike Neer teamed up for points

excrement. But they still have the re-
sponsibility to seek out all who care
and to inform all.

The simplest means of participating
in student government is to vote on
officers and on issues as the elections
are held. One benefit from a demo-
cracy is that when you are unhappy
with those who are “in” you can
“throw the rascals out.” But unless
you are educated as to the opinions
and Voting record of the EC how
will you be able to tell who the
rascals are; and if there are any at
all?

I'm a hippie-radical so I had rea-
son to suspect that my ideas and
Opionions might stand in opposition
to those expressed by the EC. I
went to the meetings to find out.

Rob Bauer ys. Bill Brown
There are some good men on the
EC: articulate, logical, and respon-
sible. But I haven't been happy with
all that I've seen. And the things
that make me unhappy effect the
whole of the Washington and Lee
community, not just the hippie radical
constituency.

I'm a senior. Bill Brown and Rob
Bauer are my representatives. | have
disagreed with both of these men on
certain issues. But Rob Bauer is
a conscientious representative. Bill
Brown misses meetings and comes
late,

In the light of recent controversy,
the EC is seriously studying its activi-
ties to see if they might be improved.
It has been a crucial time for all of
us at WAL. Bill missed the meeting
on December 2. He was at the basket-
ball game. The following week the
meeting was held on Tuesday. Bill
wanted to miss that meeting in order
to study for a test. Passavant strongly
suggested that he stay. During the
meeting I felt that I knew where
Bill Brown really was: I had been
there Freshman year during most of
my 8:25 Math classes. It was during
this meeting that a resolution for a
change in the procedure of an Honor
rial was submitted to a vote and
passed. The Honor system at Wash-
ington and Lee was altered that
night—and if my representative had
his way, he would not have been
there to vote on the change.

Last night the EC met again. Bill
was there. Thanks! But he was late.
The first order of business was trans-
acted. A vote was called for. Bill
did not vote. “I couldn't very well
vote. I didn’t hear the discussion.”

. Jorge Estrada presented the mo-
tion that was voted on. It was for
financial assistance with his Mock
OAS project. Jorge is a senior. Bill
Brown represents the senior class?
Sandler's committment

During the December 10th meet-
ing, with the motion regarding honor
trial procedure, an issue was raised
that calls into question the effective-
ness of the Executive Committeemen
as representatives of the student body.
The motion called for tape recordings
of EC honor trials to be considered
admissable evidence in an appeal if
the defendant decided not to testfy
before a student body hearing. Dur-
ing the discussion of this motion it
was suggested by one member that
the motion be passed because it would
help to protect the decision of EC
before the student body. It was only

Steve Sandler who spoke out and
suggested that it would be more
consistent with the role of the EC
if they concern themselves with the
protection of the interests and the
rights of the student involved. His
statement received some approving
murmurs, a few nods, but the motion
was passed one vote shy of unanimity
—his vote.

Perhaps there are juniors who dis-
agree with Sandler, the junior EC
representative. Perhaps there are
other students who disagree with the
final decision of the EC on this mo-
tion. The educated and enlightened
participant in a representative demo-
cracy would find out the “why” of
his representative’s vote.

Double honor standard

The resolutions proposed last night
attempted to ensure the protection
of the individual during an EC honor
hearing. Perhaps a double standard
exist? A different procedure when
there is a different interest at stake?
Should there be any diffeernce at all
between the interest of the EC in an
Honor trial and the interest of the
defendant?

With the help of that friend of
all Freshman history students, the
Barnes and Noble College Outline
Series (no, 12), 1 recently discovered
that the Congress of Vienna in 1815
attempted to preserve the ancien re-
gime of the European powers in the
face of Liberalism which favored
political, intellectual, and economic
freedom for the individual. This de-
fense of vested interests was not
successful. There certainly are les-
sons to be learned outside of the
classroom.

 

EC discusses exams, amendments,

from 9 until 12 a.m., from 2 until
5 p.m., and from 7 until 10 p.m.

The logistics of distributing, sort- |
ing, and collecting the exams would |
be handled by a central examination |
committee, which would employ 1) |
no student help, 2) secretarial as-|
sistance when possible, and 3) pro- |
fessorial direction at the beginning |
and end of each 3-hour exam period. |

For those courses in which indi-|
vidual exams would be impractical
(such as fine arts), arrangements |
would be made in advance under
conditions similar to those in effect
now. In the case of those exams on
which professors expect more than
3 hours to be spent, action in what-
ever form, the EC decided, would as
a matter of course come from the
faculty.

The Executive Committee indicated
that if it passed such a proposal, it
would require that all examinations
be taken within the academic build-
ings, and that—since exams for all
students in one particular class would
be the same—no discussion of exams
take place during the entire 9-day
period,

Mel Cariwright who was the high
scorer with 25 points and the scrap-
ping of all the Generals on the boards
and on defense kept W&L in front.
With time running out the Quakers
tightened up their defense and got a
few quick baskets to close the gap,
with John Dixon a sophomore for-
ward for Guilford hitting well from
the floor. Guilford’s full-court press
came too late to halt the rampaging
Generals. And it was an impressive
25 for 39 at the foul line that was
the real reason for Washington and
Lee's big win.

A packed gym witnessed WAL’'s
margin climb to a phenominal 18
points. Sensational plays by Mel Cart-
wright and Charlie Stone (7 points)
along with the hot shooting of Nor-

wood Morrison (21 points) and Stu |

Fauber (18 points) brought the fans
to their feet on several occasions.
Equally as impressive was the re-
bounding and defense of Mike Neer

Bill Rhyne. With two minutes left

chorus of the “Washington and Lee
Swing” rose up loud and clear.

Yesterday Coach Verne Canfield
stated that the Generals must rebound
well, stop the high-geared offense of
their opponent and control the ball

would quickly add one thing—hitting
free throws in the clutch which made
him a very happy man last evening.

Proposed amendments

Ron Kessler brought before the
EC three proposed Constitutional
amendments which had been set forth
in an editorial in The Friday Ring-tum
Phi last week,

For our readers’ background in-
formation, any proposed amendment
presented to the EC with 50 signa-
tures must be submitted to the student
body for vote in a referendum. If
the EC approves the proposals, by
two-third vote two times, the ref-
erendum must net 50% approval to
pass. If the EC votes nay, then 75%
approval is needed for the changes
to go into effect.

The first proposed amendment was
that “Any student convicted of an
honor violation is guaranteed the
right of appeal by student body hear-
ing.

This first proposal attracted light |
by |

reaction, generally disfavorable,
the EC on the grounds that it would
perhaps create problems for the
special sub-committee investigating
possible revisions to the entire honor
procedure. Passavant indicated that
the sub-committee (Messrs. Hendricks,
Passavant, Prof. McThenia, and Pres.
Huntley) may come forward with
some recommendations making appeal
through a different route the rule,
as opposed to appeal through  stu-
dent body hearing.

Kessler, though he said he saw
the need for this interim protection,
half-heartedly agreed not to press the
point on this proposal.

The Executive Committee began to
become more heated in its discussion
over the second proposed Constitut-
ional amendment: “Any student ac-
cused of an honor violation must be
informed of the specific charges
against him at least 24 hours prior
to his hearing before the Executive
Committee.”

Kessler said he supported this pro-
posal because it allowed accused stu-
dents to have time to formulate a
defense in their behalf.

The adverse reaction took several
routes: |) if you're innocent
you don't need to worry about a
defense because, according to several

Furnishings for the new house will

therefore, will be salvaged from the
old house and used in the new one
wherever possible.

members of the EC, it is nearly im-
possible to be convicted and be in-
nocent at the same time; 2) such a
proposal would allow many guilty
people more time to develop an air-
tight lie; and 3) the proposal would
also possibly jeopardize the sub-com-
mittee’s recommendations.

Kessler insisted that students should
be allowed to have some voice in the
procedural matters of honor, and
Steve Sandler supported him on. this
point (though not many others). It
was pointed out that the Constitution
gives “sole jurisdiction” to questions
of honor to the EC,

A vote was taken by the EC on
this second proposal, There were no
votes in favor, nine opposed, no
abstentions. Jay Passavant did point
out, however, that any accused per-
son may secure for himself additional
time, for whatever reason, if he so
requests; each accused person is ask-
ed by the EC before a trial if he is
prepared to testify.

Jay Passavant described the third
proposed amendment as one which
would “change the entire honor trial
process.” The proposal read: “Each
student is guaranteed the right of
conducting his own defense at an
Executive Committee hearing. This
includes the rights (personally or
through an advocate) of facing and

cross-examining his accusers, and of

calling and questioning witnesses in
his own behalf.”

The EC blasted Kessler with re-
buttals that the functions of prosecu-
tor and defense attorney are not those
of the EC, that the EC is not in
business on a legal trial basis, and

that an accused person may face
(though not question) his accusers
anyway.

Kessler replied—though the dis-

cussion was quite lengthy—that he
wanted to constitutionally guarantee
these rights for students. The ques-
tion was called, and the motion to
endorse the proposals was defeated,
none in favor, eight opposed, and
one abstaining (Phil Thompson).

Passavant said, however, that the
ideas in all three proposals would
be presented to the sub-committee,
and he “guaranteed” they would be
given close attention,

It was not clear whether Kessler
would present the 3 proposals to the
Executive Committee with 50 signa-
tures, or whether he would wait until
the sub-committee had reported (prob-
ably sometime next February).

Funds for OAS

Jorge Estrada, originator (last
week) of the idea for a Mock
Organization of American States at
Washington and Lee, appeared be-
fore the Executive Committee to re-
quest $50 with which to buy stamps
and paper for preliminary mailings.

After brief discussion, Steve Sandler
moved that the EC appropriate the
funds to Estrada’s project, to be re-
paid if possible. The motion passed
and the funds were granted. (The
volte on the motion was 8 in favor,
none opposed, and one abstention by
virtue of being late to the meeting).

Prohaska, Hall
Plan To Leave
For New Jobs

Two W&L fine arts instructors have
announced plans to leave the Uni-
versity at the end of this academic
year.

They are Raymond J, Prohaska, an
Instructor in Fine Arts and Artist-
In-Residence since 1964, and David
A. Hall, who has been an Instructor
in Fine arts and Artist-In-Residence
for the past year.

These announcements raise to three
the number of Fine Arts Department
members who have left the University
in the past two years. The first was
Sterling Boyd, who accepted an invita-
tion last spring to organize a Fine
Arts Department at Wake Forest.

Prohaska has decided to leave the
Lexington community to help Boyd
in his new task. He will assume his
new position next fall,

When asked the reasons for his
decision, Prohaska stated that Wake
Forest would offer a better market
for his artwork and better facilities
for his traveling needs. Also, Pro-
haska pointed out the fact that Wake
Forest offers him appropriations for
traveling expenses and would pay him
more for his efforts.

Prohaska also cited another point.
He stated, “Last year the University
issued a statement that no one could
work past the age of 70, and I am
nearing that age. | don’t have that)
problem at Wake Forest.”

Hall, a graduate of Amherst Col-
lege and a post-graduate of the Ohio
State College of Fine Arts, said that
he is looking for “some school which
will offer the most modern facilities”
in which to work “for both him and
his students.” He has been “unsatisfied
with the department at W&L  be-
cause of its seeming lack of ability
to modernize” and feels that his stu-
dents are “capable of doing much
more than they are now permitted.”

Also, Hall says that he will be
looking for a place which will per-

 

haps have a greater market for his
art. He presently has an exhibition at
duPont Hall but feels that for as
cheaply as he is selling his works,
he should be able to sell many more
than he has. He plans another exhibi- |
tion at Hollins College February 10
through March 6 “with hopes that
this one might be more profitable.”

When asked about his plans for
the future after leaving Washington
and Lee. Hall said he doesn’t know
yet, He has written several schools,
such as Valparaiso College. Witchita
Siate, and Bloomington, but has not
received any replies so far.

This year’s Fancy Dress will pro-
vide a new element for the W&L
dance scene, with psychedelic music
and a professional light show featur-
ed at the Saturday night concert.

The weekend will begin on Friday,
Jan. 31, with a formal ball Friday
evening at 9 in Evans Dining Hall.
This year the theme will honor new
President Huntley, as it is to be called
“An Inauguration Ball.” Les and
Larry Elgart and their band will pro-
vide music for the occasion.

On Saturday a cocktail party will
be held in Red Square from 4 p.m.
until 6 p.m. Willie T. and the Magnifi-
cents will play for the party at which
gain punch is to be served, as at
the previous cocktail party for Open-
ings Weekend.

The concert is scheduled for Satur-
day night. It will be held in Doremus
Gymnasium, beginning at 8 p.m.
Playing for the concert will be two
groups, the Kallabash Corporation
and the The Fever Tree. Lighting
will be provided by Pablo’s Environ-
mental Light Srow, the same company
which set up the light shows at New
York's Electric Circus. The theme of
the concert itself differs from that
of the weekend as a whole. It will
be “Love-In 69,” and for the con-
cert conventional dress will be
| abandoned and “appropriate” dress is
| .
| to be substituted.
| This year’s president of the Fancy
| Dress Weekend is Phi Delt Don
| Sharpe, who is assisted by 15 vice
| presidents, including Phi Delts Rick
McMillan, Hank Wilson, Bart Good-

 

 

ber of Delia Tau Delta, Phi Delta

Peter Vurnax, Evans Manager,

Has Been Relieved Of Position

By CHIP HARRIS

The news that Peter E. Vurnax has
been relieved as Manager of Evans
Dining Hall was announced _ this
afternoon by representatives of Slater
Food Service. Vurnax had been at
Evans Hall since November, 1967,
and was officially appointed its man-
ager last June,

The official explanation for the
action by Slater Food Service was
released by their district manager,
Mr. James Truttel. He said that
“Vurnax had failed to follow com-
pany policy and was not keeping up
on his reports and records.”

While all the facts concerning this
case were not clear at press time,
Vurnax’s dismissal has already raised
considerable dissatisfaction from both
the student body and athletic officials.

Jorge Estrada, a personal friend
of Vurnax and “a student interested
in the dining hall,” said “I feel that
there are three important things to
consider for a man in Mr. Vurnax’s
position. First, his attitude toward
the students is important; secondly,
his attitude towards his employees;
and thirdly, his attitude toward the
company he works for. His (Vurnax)
mistake seems to have been that he
put more emphasis on the first two.
As far as the students there has
never been a better manager than
Mr. Vurnax.”

Truttel pointed out that “ as both
a friend and the man who hired
Pete Vurnax, | am as disturbed as
anyone over his dismissal. However,

repeated warnings were issued by
Slater Foods to rectify the situation,
which he iignored.”

Several students claimed they were
informed, after Vurnax’s appointment,
that an assistant manager would be
forthcoming. The previous manager,
William Albright, had the services of
Vurnax as an assistant manager.

Several students interviewed indi-
cated that Vurnax was often hard
pressed to find either the time to
complete the paper work himself or
obtain adequate hel pto do it. While
one of the chefs proved valuable in
fulfiilling some of the magerial re-
sponsibilities, he neither had the time
no rthe training to assume al Ithe
functions of an assistant manager.

Game Broadcast

WLUR-FM radio (91.5 MC) will
carry live coverage of next Wednes-
day afternoon's basketball game from
Annapolis, Maryland, between Wash
ington and Lee and the Naval Aca-
demy. Mikey Philipps, University Di-

the game's play-by-play, as he did
for all Generals’ road football games
last fall. He will be assisted by John
Wolf, who will be the color man
for the broadcast. Wolf, a senior, was
co-captain of the football team.

Tip-off time for the game is sched-
uled for 3:55 p.m., with the broad-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Research Proves U.S. Mariyyuana Laws Too Strict

The subject of marijuana, cannabis,
“grass,” “pot’—whatever one may call it, is
now a topic of discussion on the Washington
and Lee campus. We have made a study con-
cerning this drug and wish to present our
results and conclusions to you at this time.

Our sources for this study are a New York
Times copyrighted article appearing in the
December 15, 1968 Richmond Times-Dis-
patch (headlined “Marijuana Study Finds
No Lasting Effects”); ‘Marihuana and So-
ciety,’ an article appearing in the June 24,
1968 Journal of the American Medical As-
sociation; an interview with Dr. R. Terrell
Wingfield, University psychiatrist, and various
other medical reprints.

The source of marijuana is the hemp plant
(cannabis), which has been used as an in-
toxicant for many ages in all parts of the
world. In dogs and monkeys small doses of
the components of cannabis have produced
complete anasthesia. However, studies on the
effects of cannabis on human beings are in-
complete. The most recent study has been
made by a team of Boston University re-

searchers. The team concluded that after
people smoke marijuana for an extended
length of time (not specified in the study),
they learn to ‘adapt to and overcome their
performance deficits.” On the other hand,
most of those who had never smoked mari-
juana before did not experience a “high.”
Instead “all experienced a small but significant
impairment of performance on simple tests,
ability to think clearly and motor coordina-
tion.”

A member of the study team noted that
after their subjects had smoked marijuana
they became more “‘present-oriented and talk-
ed more about their immediate surroundings
than about their past’? when they tried to
relate past experiences. They also could not
continue logical lines of thought.

In the end the team concluded that mari-
juana is harmless. “It’s not like alcohol, which
can seriously injure, even kill, you,” said one
of the researchers. ‘But I would not minimize
the effects of marijuana on brain function.”

For this reason, authorities like Dr. Wing-
field are somewhat skeptical about marijuana.

Honor

We learned two things about the honor
system in the December 17, 1968, Tuesday
Ring-tum Phi editorial. The first thing we
learned is that the “men of the EC are not
our peers;” the second thing we learned was
the “honor system’s strength on this campus
lies largely rooted in awe (or fear) of the
Executive Committee.”

To begin with the first point, we consider
the members of the Executive Committee as
our peers. They are our equals. It is true
that we have entrusted them with certain
responsibilities which may give them the title
of “leader,” but they are students just like
us. Their high position does not make them
infallible, especially in cases concerning the
question of honor. Sometimes it is possible
they may lose sight of this. Put yourselves in
their places and see how hard it is to be
totally objective when you suspect someone
is guilty of an honor violation. Your ques-
tions will undoubtedly be slanted and the
answers you receive will not be entirely in-
terpreted without bias.

This does not mean we think the Executive
Committee is failing to fulfill its purpose as
the enforcer of the honor system. But what it
does mean is that members of the EC, like
us, can make mistakes. As was stated in the
news story concerning the EC meeting De-
cember 16, “if you're innocent then you
don’t need to worry about a defense because,
according to several members of the EC, it
is nearly impossible to be convicted and be
innocent at the same time.” We are concerned
about the “nearly impossible” part.

The proposed amendments taken to the EC
for their consideration were efforts to ensure
due process for those students accused of
honor violations. At the same time, they were
intended to reduce any possibility of a mistake
on the BC's part. Admittedly, they may make
the EC’s decision on a person’s innocence or

 

System Rooted In Students

guilt a little harder, but why shouldn't a per-
son be given due process?

Anyone who believe he has not been treated
fairly (ie., given right of due process) in
being convicted by the EC will take his case to
a public honor trial. At this time, a student
jury will almost invariably acquit him. Public
honor trials which reverse EC decisions will
tend to hurt the honor system more by re-
ducing the faith students have in its enforcers.

With the above in mind, we strongly urge
the sub-committee studying the honor system
(Jay Passavant, Pete Hendricks, President
Huntley and Professor McThenia) to put in
writing the rights which every students should
have when he appears before the EC on an
honor violation.

The second point we learned from the
editorial was that the honor system’s strength
is a result of the fact that students fear the
EC. Admittedly, when a student appears be-
for the EC, he must be scared. In addition,
the ultimate penalty might be argued by some
to be a deterrent to honor violations. How-
ever, we believe the strength of the honor
system lies in the student body. The honor
system is either strengthened or weakened by
the students. The students realize that an
honor system run by them is the most advanta-
geous and the fairest system. Students them-
selves report other students who they suspect
are guilty of honor violations. Therefore, the
system is rooted in the students, not in fear.
The 12 members of the EC would have
nothing to uphold if the system were not
first upheld by the student body.

As for the question of fear of the EC, stu-
dent body president Jay Passavant is trying
to dispel this by publicizing the fact EC meet-
ings are open to everyone. He is trying to
dispel rumors of secrecy concerning EC busi-
ness. He wants the EC to communicate with
students and exchange ideas with them, This
is hardly a basis for fear.

 

He agrees with the Council on Mental Health
which states, ‘“The fact that no physical de-
pendence develops with cannabis does not
mean it is an innocuous drug. Many stimulants
are dangerous psychoactive substances al-
though they do not cause physical depend-
ence.”

Wingfield also commented on the argument
put forth by advocates for legalizing mari-
juana that it is less harmful than alcohol. He
said that the advocates were comparing rela-
tively small doses of marijuana with large doses
of alcohol. When we asked Dr. Wingfield
whether there may be any more physical or
psychical harm to “social” smokers (smoke
only on weekends) than there would be to
social drinkers, he could not provide an answer
because of a lack of research on the subject.

In his article on page three, “Peace” states
that the real crime is not the smoking of pot,
but the laws concerning it. Persons violating
the federal law pertaining to possession of
marijuana may be sentenced to two to 10 years
in prison for the first offense. The penalties
increase to five to 20 years for the second
offense and 10 to 40 years for additional
offenses. Only for the first offense are sus-
pensions of sentence, parole or probation al-
lowed. Penalties for selling marijuana are even
more severe.

Particularly unfair are the consequences if
a college student is convicted for possession of
marijuana. A conviction could ruin chances
for advancement after college graduation. In
many cases a prospective lawyer can be forbid-
den to become a member of the bar of his
state with such a conviction on his records.

A recent case in Prince George County
(Md.) shows the inequities of the laws con-
cerning marijuana. Eight young men were
sentenced to two years in prison for possession
of the drug. At the same time, the court sen-
tenced a youth to three years for possession of
opium, probably one of the most harmful
“hard” narcotics.

Dr. Wingfield and others agree that laws
concerning possession of marijuana should
not be as strict as they are now. Although
research is still incomplete, enough evidence
has been recorded to show that the laws con-
cerning marijuana are too harsh and unrealis-
tic for the danger of the drug. More emphasis
should be placed on rehabilitating rather than
punishing those psychologically dependent on
marijuana. Indeed, Dr. Wingfield sees more
potential danger for abuse with amphetamines
than with marijuana.

Amphetamines, known to students as diet
pills, “pep” pills and dexedrine, are useful
in treating epilepsy, mental retardation and

weight reduction. Dr. Wingfield speculates
that there are approximately 500 ampheta-
mine tablets manufactured per person in this
country per year. Somewhere between the
manufacturers and the druggists, many of
these pills are sidetracked and end up in the
hands of students. We asked Dr. Wingfield
why the government could not limit the
amounts of these amphetamines manufactur-
ed. He speculated that powerful lobbies in
Washington, D.C., prevented this.

In the Prince George case referred to previ-
ously, the penalty for possession of ampheta-
mines without prescription was imprisonment
for six months.

Users of marijuana also contend that leg-
alization of the drug may make it possible for
the government to keep a closer eye on its
distribution, strength and quality. (Dr. Wing-
field noted that an African strain of mari-
juana is showing up in this country which is
highly addicting. On the other hand, much
of the marijuana showing up at Washington
and Lee, which claims to be the Mexican
strain, is not really marijuana at all. Often
it just consist of weeds.) Legalization of the
drug would entail establishing legal strengths
and keeping out all foreign, stronger strains.
Unfortunately, legalization would not neces-
sarily make it easier to control foreign strains,
according to government officials.

On the question of the government’s right
to legislate morality and restrict an individ-
ual’s rights to do whatever he wants to him-
self, Wingfield has no real answer. He com-
mented that this argument has always existed
and no one really knows where government
should draw the line.

We believe marijuana will eventually be
legalized, but it will take a long time and
much more research before this will be a
reality. In addition, it will take many educa-
tional programs to relate the effects—harmful
and harmless—of the drug. For the time be-
ing, however, it is imperative that the laws
concerning this drug be made less strict.
There are many inequities which exist and
these should be eliminated. We ask that stu-
dents take notice of the stiff court penalties.
They demonstrate that although marijuana
may not be physically or psychologically
damaging in a permanent sense, the laws
concerning its use may be.

In the final analysis, we must agree with
Dr. Wingfield when he told us, “I do not
agree with the Establishment on this subject.
I am not close-minded about its legalization.
But I do not have information to say it (mari-
juana) is bad; and I can’t say it’s good.”

 

 

Letters To The Editor

Tuesday Editorial Rapped
Dear Editor:

I cannot allow three statements in
the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi to pass
without comment,

(1) “The honor system's strength
on this campus lies largely rooted in
awe for fear) of the Executive Com-
mittee.”

Anyone who could make such a
statement has a condescending attitude
toward his fellow students, no sense
of personal honor or both.

I have not been affected by the
WAL Honor System as such because
| have a sense of personal honor
which precludes lying. cheating, of
stealing. | am noi so self-righteous as
to think | am the only one on campus
who feels this way. In fact, if | am

When a person does not cheat
because he is afraid of being caught
and punished, he is not doing it be-
cause of a sense of honor, Honor in
this sense is 4 negative rather than
a positive trail, and | for one want

(2) “The adverse reaction (to Ron
Kessier's proposal that a person ac
cused of an honor violation be given

24 hours in which to prepare 4
defense) took several routes: 1) if
youre innocent, it is nearly
impossible to be convicted and be
innocent at the same time; 2) such

a proposal would allow many guilty
people more time to develop an ait-
tight lie.”

The Executive Commitice seems to
be more concerned with conviction
than protecting the rights of the stu

deni. If a student is guilty of an
honor violaion, i would seem that
the EC could develop an airtight

prosecution in 24 hours much more

easily than the individual could de
velop an airtight defense
The EC would have us take its

word that it has proven to be in-
fallible when it comes to convictions
—that it could not possibly convict
an innocent person, although a guilty
| person might occasionally go unpun-
ished, With this reasoning, a student
does not need to have any basic civil
rights to fall back on when he is
accused of a violation,

If this is the attitude of the EC,
and it apparently is judging by the
unanimous votes against what seem-
ed to me to be very reasonable pro-

posals by Mr. Kessler, then the
Tuesday editor is right. These men
are not our peers. Nor are they

“leaders in questions of honor.” Gods
would be a more appropriate title

Marijuana: Pro and Con
Opinions at W&L

(EDITOR’S NOTE: The follow-
ing story has been revised by the
author from a story which ap-
peared in the Dec. 8, 1968, edition
of the Richmond Times-Dispatch.
It is reprinted with the author's

ae of AB
By MIKE HUGHES
Times-Dispatch News Bureau

LEXINGTON — According to a
local physician, marijuana grows wild
in the fields of Rockbridge County.

The students at Washington and
Lee apparently know nothing about
it. And the doctor says they probably
would not recognize it if they saw
it.

If some of the students—and few
are venturing guesses as to their
number—could find these fields, they
could save themselves a lot of trouble.

As it is, they have to buy it—
from students at other colleges, from
“pushers” in the big cities, or, as one
student did, from a_ hitchhiker he
picked up on his way to school at
the end of the summer.

Or if they are more industrious
they can grow their own marijuana—
in back yards if the land is available,
or in flower boxes.

“I would say that at least a third
of the students here have tried smok-
ing ‘pot’,” said one senior who ad-
mitted taking marijuana regularly.
“And at least 10 per cent smoke it
regularly,”

“Those figures sound very high to
me,” said Dean Edward C. Atwood
Jr. “Ten per cent would mean 150
students are smoking marijuana
regularly, and | don’t think it is
anywhere near that level.”

Whatever the percentage of users
on the campus, marijuana is becom-
ing a major concern at Washington
and Lee.

A local minister delivered two ser-
mons on marijuana recently. Without
moralizing on the topic, he presented
evidence to his congregation to edu-
cate them on the issue.

In early December President Robert
E. R. Huntley called a special as-
sembly of faculty and students to
express his fear that marijuana might
become a major “pre-occupation” at
a time when there are so many other
important matters to be faced.

Earlier in the week, Huntley had
told a reporter that “the problem is
generally widespread nationwide, be-
ginning at relatively tender ages, at,
say, the high school level.”

Huntley lists several reasons for
his concern about the “pot” problem.

“Of course, my major concern is
the harm it is likely to do the avid
users of it. | know that the debate
is raging over the effects of marijuana.

“And | know many argue that it
is not addictive. But it could well be
habituating in the sense that any
stimulating experience is habituating.

“And also, by the time the debate
settles, the problem might be too
large—it might be an accepted social
custom—to do anything about.”

“Even if it is assumed that it has
no ill effects, it concerns me for a
number of reasons,” he added.

“It would seem that marijuana ts

By PEACE

It is now the time for Americans
of all religions and philosophies to
realize the tenor of their times and
allow the legalization of marijuana.
The legacies of “puritanism” in
American thought have been per-
mitted to permeate—or should one
say pollute—the private and personal
actions of the individual in a theoreti-
cally democratic society for too long
a period.

The decision to take part in the
use of marijuana should reflect not
the paranoia of antiquated laws, but
the free and unhindered decision of
an individual, as is now the case
with liquor, cigarettes, reading ma-
terial and our own personal actions.
We stand as mute witnesses while a
civilization grinds itself to a halt in

a jungle 10,000 miles away. Yet
those of us who care about the
country and where it is going can

not reconcile the heady propoganda
issued from some office of Bureau-
cracy in Washington claiming we
are fighting for freedom while at

 

home, people are denied a very basic
freedom: the freedom of choice.

of government's attempting to legislate |

in the 1920's.
repeat such an error.
ment’s place is not,
been, to dictate, without superificial |
recourse either to morality or public |
opinion, the private and highly per-
sonal choices of an individual.

The

possession, but the actual laws which
can incarcerate an individual for up

to five years in the “superior” Ameri-
can penal institutions. Such laws
should not pertain to an action in

which an individual has exercised his
freedom of choice concerning his life,
an essential facet of any democracy.
Such action relates only to that indi-

Cagers Take

Split First Two of 1969

BULLETIN: The Generals upped
their record to 10-2 by beating
Bridgewater 73-67 in a close game
on the Eagles court. Mel Cart-
wright and Mike Neer led the Gen-
erals with 18 and 17 points. Game
honors went to the Eagles’ Rick
Wampler, who had 31. Tomorrow
the Generals host West Virginia
Wesleyan and Monday they play
Elon, also here.

By THUNDER THORNTON

Washington and Lee saw one win-
ning streak broken over the holidays
but started another Tuesday night at
Doremus Gymnasium. Coach Can-
field and his charges got a “nice
Christmas present” with an easy vic-
tory in their own W&L Invitational
beating Shepherd College 89-65 and
Bloomsburg 87-75 in the finals. This
boosted the hosts’ winning streak to
eight, following an opening game loss
to Randolph-Macon.

January 4th saw the Generals in
Baltimore taking on Baltimore U. and
suffering an 89-73 loss, breaking their
streak and representing the worst loss
of the young season, But the recently
returned student body saw W&L
bounce back with an 80-75 win over
Virginia Commonwealth at home.

lhe Generals were perhaps a little
inhospitable in their tournament, win-
ning with ease and garnering most of
the individual honors. Shepherd put
up a good fight in the beginning and
tied the score at 10-10 after about 5
minutes of play. But Mel Cartwright
began to display his magic, and the
Rams from West Virginia fell be-
hind, Foul calls hurt the visitors and
Shepherd had to give up the services
of star Bill Thompson early in the
second half. Capitalizing on 52 free
throw chances, the Generals placed
four men in double figures: Cartwright
with 24, Mike Neer 18, Stu Fauber

| Bees led only 42-40 at the half, but

 

13, and freshman Mike Daniel 12.

the championship pitted Blooms- |
burg against the home forces, after |
the Pennsylvanians had blasted Glas- |
boro 93-77 the previous night. |
Bloomsburg jumped out to an early |
lead, as much as seven points at one |
time, but once again Cartwright |
proved the key, handing the Gen-|
erals their first lead on a jumper
from the corner. Neer went on a six |

point scoring binge to give Wal |
un eleven point halftime spread!
and a comfortable margin. Once

again the winning Generals had four |
players in double figures. Cartwright
led again with 24. Neer followed with
16, and twelve rebounds to go with
his fourteen caroms of the semifinal

game. Charlie Stone, the other half
of Martinsville’s gift to Washington
and Lee basketball, kicked in with 16
markers and sophomore Bill Rhyme
added 14,

Cartwright was an obvious choice
for MVP and Neer joined him on the
all-tournament team, Bloomsburg
placed Bob Snyder, Sphepherd added
Bill Thompson (who led them to an

89-86 consolation win over Glass-
boro), and Glasboro sent Charlie
Russo.

Last Saturday Washington and Lee
traveled to Maryland for an encounter
with Baltimore U. The Generals went
into the game tied for tenth place in
field goal percentage, blistering the
nets at a 50.4 per cent clip. But the
Bees had a gaudy record themselves,
a 6-2 mark with one loss coming to
nationally-ranked La Salle. Coach
Canfield knew his boys could shoot
and score, but he feared that de-
fensing Baltimore's sensational sopho-
more Isaiah Wilson might be the real
task. Wilson, a 6-2 jumping jack,
had impressive credentials and the
game more than proved that the press
clippings were true, Wilson blitzed the
visitors for thirty points, nineteen of
which came in a second half spurt
that gave the game to Baltimore. The

 

were well ahead at the end 89-73.
Mike Neer led W&L with 24 points,
but Cartwright was held to twelve |
and Neer was lost to the Generals |
with five minutes left on fouls.

Tuesday Washington and Lee edged |
Virginia Commonwealth 80-75, once
again paced by the scoring of Magic
Mel Cartwright. The Rams could not
contain the baseline drives on the big
junior, and Mel time and again
treated a boisterous crowd of Gen-
eral fans to the fluid layups that have
become his trademark. Mel managed
24 points and received ample help
from Neer underneath and = sharp-
shooter Norwood Morrison from out-
side. Morrison was also instrumental
in breaking the VCU press of the
late stages. Despite Cartwright’s fine
point total, he had to surrender game
honors to leaping Charlie Wilkins,
with 28. Keith Lawson added 27 and
Len Creech contributed some fine play
in the closing minutes to make the
game close.

as many as ten officers plot to bust
someone for possession of nickel bag
while in that same city serious and

It is a given medical fact that un-

like alcohol, marijuana is not ad-
dictive and need not lead to other
drugs. It is not the doctor who

opposes the legalization of marijuana,
but the scared politician. This is the
same politician who utters some

Students tend to agree.

“IT know there’s acid on campus,”
said one student, a campus leader,
who says he was offered some at a
“pot” party, “But there’s not much.
I don’t think anyone is mainlining

needle). It’s manly all oral stuff,

“For example, one guy had some

late chip cookies—you eat them, a

The obvious factor of the “seep-
age” of the marijuana supply from
the students at the university to the
local high schools does not yet seem
to be of major proportions.

“We have no evidence of any use
of marijuana by our students,” said

Frank Thompson, principal of Lex-

“Of course we have the usual

rumors of students experimenting with
drugs and narcotics, but rumors
abound at every school.”

ALL RIGHT NOW, when was the last time you wrote home? Well,

we suggest this might be a good time to

larly with the holidays coming

get off a letter—particu-
up. Granted it’s more blessed to

give than to receive... but it never hurts to drop a few hints, And
here are some fashion items that might make excellent entries on

your Christmas list:

SPORTCOATS SURGE to the fashion fore-

ground with big, bold plaids—giant Glens, win-
dowpanes, pattern-on:pattern overplaids—the
bolder the better, Side vents are deep...up to

 

 

 

 

14 inches ...and waist suppression furthers the
: trend toward shape. While on sportcoats, we
should mention the Billiard Cloth Blazer. Tai-
lored in bulky, hefty baize in single and double-

breasted models, these new blazers have the
t soft, smooth look of a billiard table-top—with
colors to match. In addition to the traditional

navy, brighter blazers will be seen in real bil-

liard green and camel, tan and gold shades.
Try this blazer with patterned slacks—so pop-

ular right now

THE EASY SUIT bring

and you should chalk up lots

; —z—

cept to college wardrobes, with

gangs of latitude for the imaginative dresser. In this case “easy”
means “easy to interchange,” for this is a suit that can be just as
easily worn with turtleneck as with shirt and tie. The jac kets range

from variations on the Regency the

me to double-breasted pea-coats

++-fome are fly-front, some collarless. Trousers are generally
slightly flared...and the over-all look wil! stamp the wearer with
distinct individuality—no bad thing in this era of fashion revo-

lution.

LAST MINUTE SUGGESTIONS for that Christmas list: matching

mufflers, gloves and sweaters in bright wools, either solid celer o1
border-striped ... bodyline sportshirta,..toiletries (there's auch :
raft of new products and scent *, we suggest you check them o

first...then indicate specific preferences),

comment for which contributions
are solicited from students and
By REEVE KELSEY
News Editor

I felt the need for perhaps a more
objective exposition of the legal as-
pects of marijuana and of the ad-
vantages of legal marijuana as ex-
pressed by Peace. In this article |
am entirely indebted to the March
1968 edition of the Columbia Law
Review (known in the Law School as
68 Columbia Law Review 521) en-
titled “Hallucinogens.” Although the
main thrust of the article concerns
the legal aspects of hallucinogens, it
contains a lengthy introduction on
“the drugs and their effects on the
user.”

I do regret that Peace found it
necessary to involve marijuana with
Vietnam, and his statement that civili-
zation has ground to a halt seems
somewhat debatable and sad with its
assumption that the entire American
nation is stagnating because of Viet-
nam.

1 would first like to summarize
portions of the Columbia article con-
cerning the effects of marijuana on
the individual. The actual manner in
which marijuana chemically affects
the brain is unknown, “With mati-
juana . available information is
more enlightening about the state of
mind that is produced than about the
chemical reaction or other reactions
that produce it.”

Prolonged usage of marijuana can
create mental instability. The Law Re-
view states that “such an experience
may seriously impair a person’s men-
tal stability and confidence over a
fairly long period.” It also states that
“there is also the possibility of long-
term personality change and brain
damage caused by repeated use of
any of the drugs, including marijuana.
While much of the immediate mental
injury seems to be related to pre-

‘The way I see it’

faculty concerning any topic. The
opinions expressed in this column
do not necessarily represent those
of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi.)

existing mental states there is some
very inconclusive evidence of long-
term damage caused primarily by the
drugs. Most of the evidence is from
observations of long-term hashish
users in the Near East; the resulting
condition seems to resemble senility.”

Peace first states that government
sale of marijuana could be an im-
portant source of revenue. This leads
one to think of a USMC (United
State Marijuana Control) store next
to your friendly ABC store. Peace,
I am sure, would be surprised to
learn that the basic law on = mari-
juana does involve taxation, On a
federal level, the possession of “un-
taxed” marjuana is a crime; posses-
sion of marijuana that has been taxed
with both the buyer and seller regist-
ered is technically legal on the fed-
eral level. There are also laws pro-
hibiting the interstate commerce of
unregistered marijuana and the im-
portation of marijuana. Hence, the
possession of any marijuana which
can be traced to origin in another
state or country is illegal. On top of
the federal laws there are comple-
mentary state laws that support the
federal law. At one time it was pos-
sible to legally use the taxed and
registered marijuana with a prescrip-
tion, but recently marijuana was re-
moved from the category of drugs
for which a prescription may be
issued,

Peace bases his plea for legalizing
of marijuana on the freedom of indi-
vidual choice. | am glad Peace does
distinguish the delicate balance be-
tween order and freedom. Basically
every additional increment of per-
sonal freedom and liberty involves a
sacrifice of the order and stability of
some small part of the society. Is

His reasons for this decision were
that the number of sick had sur

Howard Nemerov

Noted poet reads
selections tonight
in reappearance

Poet and teacher Howard Nemerov
will make a return visit to the Wash-
ington and Lee University campus
next week to lecture and read from
his poems.

See review on page 2 of Ne-
merov’s latest work of poetry.

Nemerov will read from his works
Tuesday night and will lecture Wed-
nesday night on “Poetry and Mean-
ing.” Both appearances are sponsor-
ed by the Glasgow Endowment Com-
mittee and will be at 8:15 p.m. in
duPont Auditorium on the W&L
campus. Nemerov has also scheduled
a stop at the Bookstore for Wednes-
day afternoon.

A former writer-in-residence at
Hollins College and consultant in
poetry to the Library of Congress,
Nemerov previously visited Washing-
ton and Lee in 1962 under the Glas-
gow program.

A graduate of Harvard, Nemerov
is presently teaching at Brandeis Uni-
versity.

 

Underground psychedelia
is featured for Fancy Dress
‘Love-In °69’ concert

WAL’s Fancy Dress concert has
gone underground. Providing — the
entertainment for Saturday night's
“Love-In ‘69” will be several under-
ground psychedelic groups.

The dance, to be called “An Ina-
gural Ball” in honor of President
Huntley, will start the weekend off
at a different pace. The music, pro-
vided by Les and Larry Elgart will

 

be the greatest pop and soul hit tunes
of this generation, mellowed and re-|
fined in the big band style. The band, |
having recorded a total of 36 albums, |
keeps its sound up to date, catering |
especially to college audiences.

EC; exam reform approved

In the Executive Committee's first
meeting in its new quarters in the
new Student Union Jay Passavant
announced that appointment of junior
Steve Sandler as the student repre-
sentative on the faculty Executive
Committee. Joe Tompkins and Rob
Bauer reported on their investigation
into the structure and activities of the
Dance Board; and Staman Ogilvie and
Rob Turnbull presented their proposal
on an independent exam schedule,

Passavant stated that the main pur-
pose of the student on the faculty
EC would be as liaison between the
student EC and the faculty as a
whole. Because of this, he felt that
it was imperative that the repre-
sentative be a member of the EC.
Passavant noted that the EC now has
the privilege to report to the faculty
at the beginning of every faculty
meeting.

The Ogilvie-Turnbull committee's
plan for an independent exam sched-
ule requires the student to decide
what he wants for his exam schedule
two weeks before exam week. Exam
week will consist of 10 days instead
of the present 10 academic days.
There will be three potential testing

 

periods every day. Exams may be
taken in the morning, afternoon, or |
night (except for Sunday when only |
afternoon exams will be possible). |

There are several problems that
have to be solved by the faculty be-
fore the system can be adopted. First,
the system is fairly inflexible if a
professor wants to give am exam
longer than three hours, Secondly,

 

Student apparently beaten;
suffers slight concussion

Last Thursday night between 8 and
8:30 freshman B. J. Clark was ap-
parently beaten on the W&L campus
somewhere between Washington An-
nex and duPont. The amount of
information is scanty, but according
to Clark he was jumped by what he
believed to be three people. He then
completely blacked out and did not
remember anything until he arrived
in Washington after having gone to
the Lexington bus terminal and travel-
ed to Washington where his sister
lives.

A Washington hospital confirmed
that he had suffered a slight con-
cussion, He has since returned home.
Both Bob Murray and Dean Atwood
have been concerned with the incident
and they are not at all sure whether
it was WAL students or local towns-
men who attacked him,

IFC Judicial Board puts
Betas on social probation

rhe Judicial Board of the IFC has
pul the Beta Theta Pi fraternity on
social probation through March | and
prohibited all pledging activities in-
cluding initiation also until March |
This action was taken as a_ result
of certain actions by the Betas dur
ing their Christmas party of December
i4. The SAC, in reviewing the Judi
cial Board decision, placed the Betas
on conduct probation for the fe-
mainder of the academic yeat

Social probation prohibits any girls
from entering the fraternity house and
prohibits any gathering of more than
five members of the fraternity at any
place except the fraternity house

Conduct probation is essentially a
warning that if any additional cases
involving that fraternity will be dealt
with more severely by the Judicial

Board

there are several courses for which
an independent exam is unfeasible
such as fine arts and music classes
where slides might be part of the
exam. The exam period was shortened
to 10 days as a consideration to the
faculty who fear that many students
will schedule their exams during the
last few days; hence the professor will
not have most of his exams to grade
until the very last day. The shortened
exam week, therefore, allows three
days at the end of exam week for
the professors to grade papers before
they are required to submit grades.
The proposal presented by Ogilvie

passed unanimously, Steve Sandler
then moved that the last academic

day before exams be set aside for
a reading day. He said that the
present lack of a reading day before
the January exams would be per-
petuated. His motion was seconded
by Dean Kumpuris. The motion pass-
ed 8-2 with Ogilvie and Turnbull vot-
ing against the amendment and senior
law representative Pete Hendricks
abstaining.

Faculty books range from history
of Old West to chemistry manual

The headline above is a little mis-
leading in that this is not particularly
a story about faculty publications.
There are several listed here, but our
intention is to apologize.

In No. 22 (Dec. 10) of this news-
paper, we ambitiously undertook to
publish the name of every book a
Washington and Lee professor has
ever written, and it appears we failed.

Our research staff consisted of
freshman reporter Mack Woodward,
who did all of the tracking down him-
self (with only the aid of suggestions
from the balance of the staff). Further
thwarting our goal was the lack of
a few inches of space just before we
went to press.

This happens every week, of course,
and stories ranging from the Debate
Team to the Executive Committee
to the basketball team to a movie
review often have to be cut.

But to those who may have wond-
ered why certain books were not
covered, we offer our humblest
apologies. We have made an effort in
this edition to cover those works
omitted Dec. 10-—Ed.

Chemistry Professor Esmarch §.
Gilreath has written numerous works,
including “Fundamental Concepts of
Inorganic Chemistry.”

Commerce Professor L. K. John-
son has published “Sales and Market
Managing” as well as “Marketing in
Virginia,” read by members of the
state legislature.

History Professor Emeritus William

G. Bean wrote “Stonewall’s Man:

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Staff editorials

On parietal regulations

We hope that the Student Affairs Committee will soon
take affirmative action on the IFC’s proposal to allow girls
above the ground floor of the fraternity houses. The need for
such a change has been adequately discussed in the past, but the
SAC has said that they have three major areas of concern.

First, they would like a more concrete set of regulations
governing when and under what circumstances girls would be
allowed above the first floor. Needless to say, removing all
restrictions on girls in the fraternity houses would be the most
ideal situation, but a realistic approach for the moment would
be to allow girls above the first floor whenever they would be
allowed in the fraternity house. Therefore they would have to
be out of the house by 2 or 3 a.m.

Opponents of this change like to say in a very scandalous
tone, “But there are nothing but bedrooms above the first
floor!’’ The SAC expressed a similar concern. They apparently
would like a room or two that are not bedrooms above the
first floor. Many houses do have non-bedrooms above the first
floor. A room serving as the fraternity library is not uncom-
mon above the first floor. And many students like to combine
two rooms, putting all the beds in one room and the desks
in another. If the fraternities could guarantee that there would
be one of these study rooms on each floor, then perhaps the
faculty would be more willing to make this change.

Furthermore, we are still somewhat puzzled over the dis-
tinction between the fraternity houses and the apartments.
There is a sizable investment made by both the fraternities
and the University in the 18 fraternity houses, and it seems
quite mystifying why the faculty would impose this restriction
which enhances the desirability of apartment living.

The SAC’s final area of concern dealt with assurances from
the fraternities that if this restriction were eliminated there
would be significant increases in the number of upperclassmen
living in the houses. The faculty could very well agree to this
change contingent to the fraternities’ requiring 50° of those
living in the house to be juniors and seniors.

We can only hope that the SAC and the faculty will soon
take affirmative action on this proposal and that they will
simultaneously examine the same parietal restrictions imposed
on the dormitories. —R.W.K.

 

An advocate honor trial?

There are several facets of the debate on the honor system
which we feel deserve comment. There are many who feel
that the accused honor violator should have the responsibility
of preparing a defense. The Friday Ring-tum Phi of December
13 stated that “As the situation now stands, the Executive
Committee is called upon to function as prosecution, defense,
judge and jury.” Realistically the EC acts only as a jury.
They objectively determine the guilt or innocence of the
accused.

If the EC were to allow the accused to present his de-
fense, there would be two undesirable ramifications. First would
be the simultaneous creation of an independent prosecution,
for if the EC were to allow a “defense attorney” and not a
prosecution, the system would be almost completely weighted
in favor of the accused. The EC would more than likely have
to select one of its members to give up his vote and act as a
prosecutor attempting to the best of his ability to convict the
accused honor violator.

The second ramification deals with the varying “legal
competence” of the accused. It is more than obvious that
some students with the so-called legal mind would be able to
create an adequate defense, but there will be even more stu-
dents who will be entirely at a loss to create a defense; and
they will be at an even greater disadvantage when compared
with the experienced EC prosecutor.

We are sure many people have been touched with the
sense of hypocrisy inherent in the American advocate court
system where the defense attorney does all that he can to get
his man acquittted and the DA goes to great lengths to convict
the defendant. Their actions do not resemble men seeking the
truth, but men protecting their own interests. We feel that
the potential strengthening of the honor system through the
adoption of a variation of the advocate system is almost
negligible if it does not lead to a weakening of the system.

The Friday Ring-tum Phi said that it was concerned with
the nearly impossible conviction of an innocent man, There
is not a criminal court in the United States that does not run
this risk. One member of the EC recently stated that he was
convinced that anyone with any skill at lying would be acquitted
unless the physical evidence was overwhelming. And we are
still far from convinced that shift from the tribunal system to
an advocate system would at all reduce the chance of error
in the EC’s verdict.

We also question the Friday Ring-tum Phi’s rather loose
comment on the “peerage” of the EC members. Friday quoted
a Tuesday editorial stating “men of the EC are not our peers.”
We would like to finish the sentence: “They are, by their
election to that position, our leaders in questions of honor.”
We would agree that it would be very difficult to support the
first part of the sentence, but the EC are definitely not our
peers in questions of honor. They have to squarely face the
issue of honor almost weekly, while the question of honor is
incidental to the lives of most W&L students; the average
student almost never has to intellectually face the concept of

honor in his four years at W&L. —R.W.K.

PRSERVE AND _ PROTECT, by
Allen Drury. Doubleday, 394 pp.
$6.95,

He * i

By LARRY HONIG
Editor-in-Chief

In his latest attempt and the third
unsuccessful sequel to the brilliant
“Advise and Consent,” author Allen
Drury comes off as a rather pompous,
soap-operaesque George Orwell in
“Preserve and Protect,” labeling the
unlabelable, black and white.

Those of us who were captivated
by “Advise and Consent” will, after
“Preserve and Protect,” perhaps give
up hope that from the pen of this
crack journalist can come another
worthwhile political novel. Although
Drury has left the doldrums of “A
Shade of Difference” and the dull
duplicity of “Capable of Honor,” he

4
r

    

 

Drury .... finished?

falls far short of holding the reader's
attention through this, his fourth in a
series of works whose pattern is less
than clear.

Drury’s central—and fatal—flaw is
that he has at once too much plot and
not enough action. At the beginning
of the book, the President of the
United States dies mysteriously, just
after having been renominated.

In contention to head the new
ticket are two men; one is the ex-
President's running mate, pure, gentle-
manly, righteous, diligent preserver
and protector Orrin Knox. Even his
name smacks of the dignity of Ulti-
mately Good Destiny.

Opposing Knox is evil Ted Jason,
governor of California, whose hench-
men pistol-whipped Knox's pregnant
daughter-in-law at the convention
(where Jason was edged off the ticket),
a man whom everyone in a white
hat hates—even his wife.

But as Drury is ever so kind to
point out on nearly every page, those
who have access to the communicative
media do not wear white hats.

There is no dearth of acerbic re-
marks directed at the good guys by
all the major newspapers, including

Drury’s latest doesn’t
leave you breathless

the unnamed “Greatest Publication
That Absolutely Ever Was.” Also
throwing jabs are columnist Walter
Dobius, a dubious character of “Cap-
able of Honor” fame, and television
commentator Frankly Unctious.

One would be inclined to laugh off
these bitter allusions were it not that
Drury continually makes them.

So what's the root problem that
has turned reasoning topsy-turvy in
the United States a la 1985?

Violence.

It is an era when revolutionary ele-
ments in the country have forced their
beliefs into control of the mass media,
which, in turn, have the “ability,
through column, syndicate and broad-
cast, to condition the country coast-
to-coast.”

And the country has been condi-
tioned to accept bad guy Jason as
hero-to-be and his condoning of
violence as fair enough price to pay
for ambition’s rewards.

The action quickens, temporarily,
as the National Committee—amid
riots, bombings, and so forth—is
called to select its party's candidate.
While their decision and the poli-
ticking thereabout make up almost all
of “Preserve and Protect” there are
countless, not-so-subtle intrigues which
dot the pages with annoying fre-
quency.

Annoying, and dull, Drury wastes
thousands of words achieving two
needless objectives: acquainting the
reader with voluminous details from
the backgrounds of each character (to
further justify the presence or absence
of a white hat), and interjecting the
socio-political philosophy of only the
good guys, foreshadowed by his de-
dication of the novel “To the hopeful,
the well-meaning and the good heart-
ed, who may still be in the ma-

jority.”
Drury’s conclusion is amazing. Ted
Jason is brought into The Holy

Camp, or so Knox believes, betraying
Dobius, Unctuous & Co., yet eager
to join The Cause in reuniting and
restoring America. Knox is selected
as candidate for President; Jason ac-
cepts the Vice-Presidential slot. And
on the last page, one of the two men
is assassinated.

The author plans to write yet
another sequel, which presumably will
allow avid readers to stop holding
their breaths. Hopefully he will at
least inject a measure of believability
absent in this disaster.

“Preserve and Protect” is a perfect
book to keep by the bed; its diversions
are lengthy enough to induce sleep,
and when reading is resumed the
next night Drury can be trusted to
recapitulate (or regurgitate) the theme
—violence—and his ceaseless views
thereon.

For all its poor points, though,
this political novel does communicate
some of the author's vast and inti-
mate knowledge of the machinations
of present-day politics—at the Capital
and the United Nations, in the press,
and in the lives of those who are em-
powered to preserve and protect.

Enigmatic Nemerov is more
‘aware’ than some think

By KIRK WOODWARD

Howard Nemerov, the remarkable
poet, will appear tonight and Wednes-
day night at duPont auditorium.
Therefore one can say that the Glas-
gow lectures give us the opportunity
to hear a live poet, if one sees the
ambiguity of “live.” Nemerov un-
questionably breathes, etc.; but his
poetic career has constantly made its
subject the fact that a poet can write
without any life to him at all.

Nemerov, or any poet nowadays,
lives in a culture that considers him
“ex officio” dull. From experience the
poet hardly expects the “public” to
take him seriously, and what's more
the public resents him for not trying
to “communicate.” As a compromise
the poet teaches and travels around
giving readings to audiences like our-
selves: a solution that doesn’t satisfy
anybody.

So the poet has to write assuming
that (a) he has something somehow
important to say, and (b) nobody
will pay any attention, A discourag-
ing occupation (or habit). Minor
poets, feeling the strain, write poems
about this isolation. Nemerov writes
poems taking responsibility for the
situation himself, and as a result is
more than a minor poet.

Here are three qualities which
many poets have. Nemerov, however,
has them working together. They are:
a sense of humor, an awareness of
his own time, and a consciousness of
words, especially his own.

As to humor, after Nemerov’s read-
ing here in 1965, he was criticized for
his statement that “the structure of
a poem resembles the structure of a
joke,” and for making the audience
laugh. The criticism comes no doubt
from people who consider laughter a
jolly sort of thing. Nemerov’s humor,
however, springs from his sense of
the sudden discovery of something
which, if seen for itself, would cause
desperation. His humorous subjects
exist because the culture that invent-
ed them finds them important instead
of comic.

The structures of a joke and a
poem are similar because they both
bring on a sudden awareness of an
unrecognized piece of the world,
Nemerov's desperation grows from
this realization, that the world can
only be experienced fully if taken by
surprise,

His humor, as mentioned, often
concerns public events in our culture,
We know them all and are tired of

listing them: money, culture, ads,
television, supermarkets, certain
preachers .. . . Nemerov, however,

does not confront this civilization as
an enemy, but rather sees himself as
a part of it, perhaps even a cause,
and wonders what living in such a
world could do to him, or to any-
one. The culture, though, opposes this
kind of questioning. So Nemerov is
really a radical, but not dangerous,
for reasons to be considered in a
moment.

Then, Nemerov is aware that his
own words may be taken the way
ads are, as simple objects of at
tention, He knows that the better he
constructs his poetry, the more it
can be looked at just poetry, His
knowledge is trapped in his verse. The
fact that many of his poems are funny
shows that in this dilemma he can
still keep his head above water

So why isn’t Nemerov dangerous’
Well, he knows too much. His aim
is to increase self-knowledge. or at

and is more resiliant, Besides that,
most tries at “communicating” are
disguises for isolation so deep it can
never really be transcended. So no
“public” will stand for such a vision
as Nemerov'’s, no poet can make the
public listen, and no individual can
understand what Nemerov says un-
less he makes it clear for himself.

Clearly Nemerov goes against the
grain of society, which claims that
death is an illusion and that we can
all be brothers. Nemerov considers
these claims as barriers to being able
to see the world at all.

Nemerov longs to be able to see
things just for themselves. The mo-
ments of joy in his poetry come at
times when he makes a part of the
world—say, an animal, or something
in himself—appear in its own being.
He is keenly aware that he has to
“make” the thing appear that way
himself, but he knows that poetry
transcends defeat only by celebration.

Defense was the name of the game
Saturday night as Washington and Lee
took its eleventh win of the season.
The opponent, West Virginia Tech’s
Golden Bears, had hoped to slow
down the game and slip by the Gen-
erals. However, W&L rose to the
challenge and beat the Bears at their
own game.

The first half went slowly with only
a total of 36 points scored by both
teams. The Generals jumped ahead
early to a three point margin, Lead-
ing W&L were Fauber and Cart-
wright hitting extremely well from the
outside and Mike Neer blocking shots
underneath. About midway through
the half Tech had tied the score at
7-7. Tech then attempted to freeze the
ball and force W&L to change their
defense. But excellent defense by the
Generals took the ball from Tech and
Washington and Lee jumped ahead
once again by four. Morrison hit a
long one from outside and Mel Cart-
wright moved in close where he was
devastating, and the Generals left the
half leading 20-16.

In the second half W&L used its

 

outstanding match-up defense to halt
Tech. The key to the defense was
Mike Neer, who successfully clogged
up the middle and stopped any pene-
tration underneath. The Generals also
dominated the boards and moved in
closer for their shots. West Virginia
Tech could not work the ball inside
and had erratic shooting with the
exception of Tim Floyd who shot
very accurately time and again.

Mel Cartwright played a typically
superb game. He led the scoring with
19 points and had several spectacular
assists, rebounds and defensive plays.
Mel also proved that he could shoot
as well outside as inside,

Mike Neer was right behind Cart-
wright in scoring with 16 points. Neer
dominated both boards snatching 19
rebounds and teamed up with Cart-
wright for easy baskets.

But enough cannot be said about
Washington and Lee’s defense. With
the game so low-scoring, it was criti-
cal that W&L keep the pressure on
the Bears’ offense. So the Generals
used their match-up defense with Stu
Fauber and hustling Charlie Stone

Natators hand Cavaliers first loss in Doremus upset

By REEVE KELSEY

Baltimore Bill Brumback, co-cap-
tain Billy Ball, and freshman John
Lawlor sparked one of the sweetest
swimming victories as Coach Stearns’
swimmers upset the University of Vir-
ginia, 53-51, a meet not decided until
the last relay.

Washington and Lee opened up in
the 400 yard medley relay with their
strongest swimmers and set a new
pool and school record of 3:34.9 and
barely touched out UVa. The combi-
nation of Ball (backstroke,) Klein
Stuart (breaststroke), David Kympton
(butterfly), and Bill Brumback (free-
style) gave the Generals a 7-0 lead.

In the next event, the 1000 yard
freestyle, Lawlor set a new school
record with a time of 11:37.6 seconds.
Ross Forman managed a third in the
200 freestyle. Then Brumback re-
turned after a short rest and won
the 50 yard freestyle with a winning
time of 21.5 and freshman Bim Clark
followed with a close third at 21.9
seconds. Billy Ball and Hal Catlin
then went one-two in the 200 indi-
vidual medley with Ball winning with
a 2:02.2 second time. Going into the
diving the Generals were protecting
a 27-16 lead.

The Wahoo’s divers were in good
form as they managed to capture
first and second leaving the third
spot to Mike Carrere. The Generals
fortunes continued to sink as John
Lawlor was only able to catch a
third in the 200 yard butterfly com-
ing in two seconds behind the winner.
Ross Forman, smarting from his de-
feat in the 200 freestyle, gained ade-
quate revenge as he won the 100 yard
freestyle sprint with a time of 47.9
seconds, Forman was supported by
junior Roger Martin who picked up
a third in the event. The score was
now tied 35-35,

Billy Ball then glided to a win in
the 200 yard backstroke thus giving
the Generals a scant one point lead.
John Lawlor, only two events away
from his previous performance in the
200 butierfly, stroked to an easy
victory in the S00 yard freestyle
event with a time of 5:25.6 boosting
the yardage he covered in the meet
to a respectable 1700 yards. As Klein
Stuart captured a third in the 200
yard breastroke for the Generals, the
score going into the final relay was
WAL 46, UVa SI.

man, Catlin, Martin, and Brumback

Hi

 

Sophomore diving ace Mike Carrere in competition against UVa Friday. Carrere could only salvage a third but the

natators still squeezed by the Wahoos,

a neck and neck race. As in the 400
medley relay, Brumback started on
his leg of the race behind by about
half a body length. After the first
23's yards Brumback had caught his
opponent and was on his way to win-
ning the relay with the overall time
of 3:10.0.

Coaches Stearns and Bart Taylor
suddenly found themselves in the pool
as the natators relished their third
victory of the season opposed to one
loss. This was the first loss for the
UVa mermen this year.

This afternoon the Generals host

there will be a junior varsity meet

Sounding off ...

By ROY CARLTON
Sports Editor

The time has finally come for
W&L’s Generals to leave the homey
confines of Doremus Gym and seek
their fortune elsewhere. The average
Mink-around-town can't say that he
isn't sorry to see them go. Despite
its cracking walls and creaking floors,
the Blue seem to have a knack of
winning there. Last year, all five
losses were suffered on the road. This
year, of the Generals thirteen games,
ten have been played at home with
a resulting 11-2 mark to date.

There are still eleven games to go,
including the Conference tournament.
Of those, six are on the road. In
addition, the Blue must face up to
their toughest match-ups of the year
in this final week before exams and
the week after. Remember, it was a
post-exam collapse that accounted for
four W&L losses and the denial of
an NCAA bid last year.

Starting tonight in Doremus, the
Generals must prove to the country
that they are the great team every
Mink thinks they are. Their opponent
is Florida Presbyterian who had no
trouble at all in mauling the Blue
down on the peninsula last year.

Tough games await Generals

Presbyterian is tough again this year
too. Hopefully, things will be dif-
ferent this time around. W&L has
improved since last year, the team
has not entered into the slump they
were in at that time last year, and
then there's always good old Doremus
to brighten things up. A very tight
game can be expected at any rate,
and certainly it’s a crucial one to the
Blue’s NCAA chances.

All of which brings us to Navy.
Tommorrow night the Generals play
their second major college hardcourt
team since de-subsidization was com-
pleted. Don't get excited and start
betting against W&L either. Unless
they're overawed by the Academy
itself, the Midshipmen shouldn't give
them any more trouble than a lot of
teams on the schedule. But this is

concerning their investigation of the
Dance Board. They first analyzed the
method of Dance Board ticket sales.
Compared with any other potential
system, the present method of ticket
sales seems to be the best for a
school of W&L’s size and location.
The present methods insure a greater
degree of economic stability than
could be obtained by any other sys-

of the large newspaper files there.
The Southern Historical Collection,
a reserve of many manuscripts of the
period located at the University of
North Carolina, is also of prime im-
portance to Dr. Crenshaw’s research
program.

In the Washington area, Dr. Cren-
shaw will make use of the newspaper
files and the large amount of manu-
scripts.

According to Dr. Crenshaw, most
of the material needed to write the
book is to be found in manuscripts,
printed materials, books, and gov-
ernment publications. Much of the
task that remains is the process of
organizing, writing, and rewriting.

The book should be ready for pub-
lication in 1970 or 1971.

still the big event of the season. A
victory over Navy would certainly
be enjoyed, to say the least.

How is Navy? Hardly powerful, but
still potentially dangerous, and their
4-6 record has been fashioned against
considerably tougher opposition than
the Generals have faced. They play
a deliberate, almost slow-down, type
of ball. Although they can match the
Blue in height with three men at
6-6, the tallest man on their starting
five is 6-5 Bill Parks, who isn’t exactly
another Lew Alcindor. The key to
Navy lies in 6-3 John Tolmie, a
senior who should make several sec-
tional all-star teams and maybe even
one or two All-America squads. He's
that good. Averaging about twenty-
five points a game, he’s carried his
mediocre teammates on his back all
year. Stop Tolmie and you stop Navy.
Air Force held him to eight points
Saturday night and beat the Midship-
men 73-46. That's the Generals’ as-
signment and you can bet it will fall
to 6-5 Mel Cartwright. Now maybe
folks will have a yardstick by which
to measure Mel's talent.

Navy will be tough and exciting,
but just as important and maybe
tougher will be tonight's match-up
with Presbyterian. It should be well
worth seeing, so don't start looking
ahead to the Middies, the Generals
aren't.

starting to contain West Virginia
Tech.

Washington and Lee handled the
ball well and eliminated their floor
mistakes, thoughout the game. The
Generals also showed muscles on the
boards, especially on defense. Yet
WAL had trouble capitalizing on
Tech's mistakes and could not pull
out ahead until late in the game. Al-
though this game was low-scoring and
slowed down, WAL dominated the
entire contest,

The Generals needed this game
badly to give them momentum against
Navy tomorrow night. So far Navy
stands 4-6 and Washington and Lee's
hot Generals have a good chance to
bring home a big win,

tem, and they noted that tickets will
be transferable in the future, thus
eliminating one of the major com-
plaints against the Dance Board’s
policy of ticket sales.

This apparent endorsement of the
Dance Board drew criticism from sev-
eral members of the EC. Sandler
stated that the present system was
a “rook” and that “the students get
absolutely nothing for their money.”
Passavant felt that the present system
of not allowing the sale of individual
tickets until the night before the
concert was not justified and that the
Dance Board should resume selling
individual tickets before each con-
cert with substantial savings going to
dance plan purchasers.

Tompkins then dealt with several
complex problems involving Doremus
Gym. The limited seating capacity
(about 2,000 saw the 4 Tops) and
other problems with the gym re-
stricted the flexibility of the Dance
Board.

It was reported that many attempts
in the last several years have been
made to obtain the use of the VMI
fieldhouse, but that the uncooperative
attitude, in general, of the VMI
officials involved had prevented the
use of the fieldhouse. Passavant said
that there were advantages to having
the concert on the W&L campus
with its easy location to most stu-
dents.

Tompkins then endorsed the pres-
ent booking agent used by the Dance
Board but urged that they keep an]
open mind concerning the potentials
of other booking agents. He stated
that the present agent has excellent
connections with most of the major
groups in the country. The Dance
Board has had no trouble in obtain-
ing refunds from performers who have
cancelled out at the last minute and
there seems to be no indication that
this booking agent is charging W&L
any more than the reasonable going
price.

Steve Sandler then stated that he
felt the Dance Board should attempt
to contract performers as far in
advance as possible so that a stu-
dent knows exactly what he is buy-
ing when he purchases his dance plan.
Dean Kumpuris replied that the ma-
jority of the groups do not like to
make a long-term commitment to a
concert such as W&L’s, for they have
no idea whether they might have a
hit record or an attractive night club
offer between the date of signing the
contract and the date of the con-
cert. Hence it is rather futile to at-
tempt to sign groups far in advance
of a given concert.

Tompkins said then that the Dance
Board membership was to a degree
self-perpetuating and that the same
type of people always seemed to be
on the Board. He noted that there
was a need for greater representa-
tion of the student body on the Board
as well as a more diverse type of
membership.

Other recommendations included
the need for a more diverse make-up |
of the present concerts. A comedian
or entertainer should be used to avoid
the dead spots present in most of the
concerts. The Dance Board account
should be removed from the general |
student body fund as the first step)
toward a needed reevaluation of the)
entire accounting system of the stu- |
dent body fund. These steps would
give Dance Board greater knowledge
of their financial postion at any given
moment.

It was also recommended that the
Dance Board president not be allowed
his present yearly salary of $250 and

In further business, Passavant re-
ported that he and Pete Hendricks
had a very profitable meeting with
President Huntley, Dean Atwood, and
Professor MecThenia of the Law
School. The meeting dealt with the
honor system. The ideas obtained
from this meeting will be fully dis-
cussed in the first EC meeting after
exams. Passavant noted that Presi-
dent Huntley and Professor McThenia
are not members of the EC commit-
tee to study the honor system but
merely are acting in the status of
advisors to this committee.

The EC then stated its future policy
toward observers at EC meetings. No
one may leave or enter the EC
meeting after 7:30 (the meetings start
at 7:15) as merely common courtesy
to the people in the meeting. He
also stated that no visitor will be
allowed to speak unless he has ob-
tained permission from the presiding
officer to present a proposal. This was
enacted to prevent the EC from be-
coming endlessly involved in a given
issue and to improve the efficiency
of the EC’s actions. Entrance to the
EC chambers is from the back of the
Student Union, by stairway from the

Innovative

Theatre Plan
Is Disclosed

By LAWRENCE McCONNELL

Who would expect to find hard
rock music and strobe lights used to
accentuate the actions of masked
actors in an adapted Greek tragedy?
Perhaps you might expect it at a
Yale Drama School production, but
certainly not at such an austere insti-
tution as Washington and Lee.

This sort of experimentation § in
theatre is not the only trick Professor
Lee Kahn has up his magician’s sleeve,
for, next semester, Mr. Kahn plans
to launch an acting company. The
purpose of the group will be to as-
semble all students seriously interest-
ed in acting and have them work
as a group under the direction of
actors and directors from theatres
around the country

In commenting about his
idea, Mr. Kahn remarked, “I
that the idea of the company
best way to get the most out of an
individual, You're bound to get a
better results because the actor has
a chance to work consciously on his
own style, rather than on one par-
ticular part in a_ production.”

he first instructor for the company
will be Evelyn Hendrickson, an
actress from New Orleans who has
been associated with drama at Tulane
University for many years. Accord-
ing to Mr. Kahn, she has in
several movies, appeared
vision shows, and has worked
community and university theatre
well. Her husband also happens to be
the head of the drama department at
Tulane. Mr. Kahn is unsure about who
else would to work with the
company, but he said, “There will
definitely be at least one more per-
son this year.

“| hope that Mrs. Hendrickson will
be working largely with style move-

ment and script interpretation from
Shakespearean and Restortation plays. |

Although she'll only be here two}
weeks or so, those people that are |
interested ought to get a lot ac-

complished.”

Sound ambitious? At first glance,
perhaps. But anyone who has seen
a Troubadour production in the past
few years can't be too skeptical about |
its outcome.

game,

This was the first time W&L tackled
Navy since 1936, when they also
emerged as winners,

Ihe contest was tied at 29-29 with
1:17 left in the first half when Mel
Cartwright, Bill Rhyne, and Charlie

Blue in the lead for good. In the last

the final buzzer it was 69-67. A foul

spectively.

After a three-week lay-off for

Flush for Freedom

fo the Editor:

Ihe Students for Violent
Action (SVNA) is planning a massive
demonstration in protest of the exist-
ence of the new administraion. On
January 20, 1969, as Nixon says the
last word of the inaugural oath !",..
so help me God.”), we plan to have
every toilet in the country flushed.

We realize of course that we may
not be able to reach every toilet, but
we hope that, with the cooperation
of organizations such as yours, we
shall be able to reach a large majority
of them. We are attempting to enlist
the aid of students at every college
and university in the nation as well
as anyone else who wishes to join.
The protest will require a high de-

Non-

 

gree of organization effort as we hope
to flush the toilets not only of the!
dorms, apartments, and lecture halls,
in and around the campuses, but also |
downtown hotels, restaurants, railroad
and high schools, private
homes, ete.

With you rhelp in promoting this

stations,

project, FLUSH FOR FREEDOM
will be a success.

College Geeks
Hit By Draft

By ROGER MUNSICK

The Washington Post, in its No-
vember 26 edition, has cited a marked
increase in the number of college
graduates in the Vietnam wartime
army, and has designated the condi-
tions of the present draft system as
the primary reason for the upswing.

The Post discussion estimates that
Spring of the upcoming year will
find between 25 and 30 percent of
all draftees to be college graduates.

| By comparision, the draft of October,

1968, found only 20 percent of those
drafted in this category and the total
in the spring of this year was only
about five percent.

Much of this increase is due to
legislation passed in 1967, says the
Post, making the drafted graduate
student eligible for duty at the con-
clusion of the semester during which
he is called, rather than at the end
of his complete matriculation.

Draft repetitions at eighteen month
intervals, coupled with the year-long
current tour of duty in Vietnam, are
another fundamental factor in the
armed forces growing “intellectual-
ism.”

While speculation rages concerning
draft inequities, and new-found strains
on graduate schools, the question re-
mains as to the effect of a large
number of college men entering the
armed forces. When interviewed, sev-
eral former combat leaders in Viet-
nam praised the capabilities of the
individual college graduates in the
field. They cited responsibility and
the confidence placed in such men by
their superiors as prime reasons for
their opinions. Indeed, one such vet-
eran even went so far as to term
combat college graduates that he had
commanded as “damn good soldiers.”

W&L Role Key
In Amendments
To Constitution |

Washington and Lee University
graduates and students played key
roles in the proposed Constitutional
Revisions announced last week.

[Two members of the 1t1l-member |
commission are Washington and Lee |
alumni: Lewis F. Powell Jr., a mem-!
ber of the W&L board of trustees, |
former president of the American Bar
Association and president of the
State Board of Education; and Judge
Alexander M. Harman Jr. of Pu-
laski, former chairman of the State
Board of Elections.

Three of the seven lawyers who
served as counsel to the commission
are also University alumni: Andrew
W. McThenia, assistant professor of
law at W&L: and two Richmond at-
torneys, John F, Kay Jr. and
Hullihen W. Moore.

McThenia served as counsel to the
committees drafting revisions to
Article 5 of the Constitution, per-
taining to the office of governor and
the executive powers of the state
government: and Articles 10, 11 and
12, which deal with corporations and
the State Corporation Commission.

Two recent graduates of the Wash-
ington and Lee Law School and a
current student served as research as-
sistants to MceThenia, researching legal
questions and preparing memoranda

Offices Filled
In YR Election

In a special election Tuesday night,
Young Republicans named Steve Fin-
ley second vice chairman and Bruce

/ MacQueen recording secretary. Both
positions had been vacated through
| resignations,

Finley, a freshman, defeated junior

| Charles Whipple. MacQueen was un-
opposed,

The club passed a resolution pro-

| posed by Pat Arey urging Linwood
| Holton to become a candidate for

;Governor of Virginia. A Roanoke
lawyer, Holton was the Republican
gubernatorial nominee in 1965. He

is considered a likely candidate for
the governorship this year or for
appointment to a federal judgeship.

Ihe YR’s also approved a resolu-
tion offered by Jim Lawson stating
that the club should take positions
on campus issues. The previous policy
was to avoid controversies not related
to national politics.

YR President Hank Graddy won
the endorsement of the club as a
candidate for Region HI chairman.
Graddy, a Kentuckian, claims ex-
tensive support from his home state.
The region also includes Maryland
and the District of Columbia. The
chairman will be elected at the Region
Ill convention in Louisville, March
8-9,

Now a first lieutenant in the
Marines, Apgar is due to return from
Viet Nam in May. After his release
from the Marine Corps in 1970 he
hopes to pursue a career as a political
cartoonist.

The exhibit, at the duPont Art Gal-
lery, will continue through Feb. 8.

of Coach Graham E. (Buck) Leslie
to head football coach.
Corrigan, whose official title is

his duties here in early April |

Coach Leslie will continue in the
position he has held on a temporary
basis since the sudden death of coach

coach in charge of the backfield and)
continued in that until
summer.

Some Aspects of Power

By ROGER MUNSICK

Washington and Lee’s fourth an-
nual public affairs symposium, CON-
TACT, will delve into the multifacet-
ed aspects of “Power” when it begins
next week. The last-minute addition
of Black Power speaker Jack Thomas
has caused the lengthening of the con-
ference which will now run from
February 11 to 15. (Mr. Thomas’
appearances are not included on the
posters. For times, see Weekly Cal-
endar.)

An array of seven speakers, in-
cluding Senator George McGovern of
South Dakota and civil rights leader
Charles Evers will participate in the
forum.

Fhomas, twenty-one year old
Negro from Westchester, Pennsyl-
vania, will open the conference with
an eight o'clock speech in Lee Chapel.

Already looking ahead, Leslie is
searching for an offensive coach, per-
haps an additional defensive coach,
and some athletes to replace the 17
senior players who will graduate in
June.

Leslie is used to winning teams, |
despite his modesty. During his eight
years as an assistant coach, the Gen-
erals won 44 games, lost 24 and tied

three. Included were two undefeated

seasons. He also serves as assistant
golf coach.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che KRing-tum Phi
Friday

FD Evaluation: Poor

Poor taste, poor publicity and poor planning marked this
year’s Fancy Dress Weekend as one which many would like
to forget.

The Fancy Dress Ball started the festivities off in an
elegant manner. The formal attire of the couples present and
the music of Larry Elgart gave Evans Dining Hall its yearly
appearance of Versailles. It was not until one glanced (maybe
concentrated is a better word) at the decorations that the
evening was marred.

The poor taste used by the president and vice-presidents
of Fancy Dress in the decorations could have greatly em-
barrassed the University worse than it did. The decorations
demonstrated immaturity which is highly reminiscent of fra-
ternity Homecoming displays two years ago. Fortunately, the
embarrassment was confined just to Lexington.

It is not our purpose to condemn the person who was
directly responsible for this act. But we do condemn the act.
This event led the EC to pass a recommendation Monday
night that the Dance Board president supervise the president
and vice-presidents of each weekend. The Dance Board has
never had to do this in the past. It is unfortunate it must begin
now.

Poor publicity left many a couple bewildered as to what
was happening next. It is true that the Ring-tum Phi was not
published and could not relate the schedule of events. How-
ever, there was no reason why posters could not have been
distributed around the campus and fraternities informing stu-
dents what times the cocktail party and concert were to be
held. This has always been the practice in the past.

Students and their dates were left stranded outside the
Doremus Gymnasium because they could not be admitted
until 8 p.m. Then they learned that the concert (or was it
supposed to be a dance?) would not start until 8:20 p.m.
In addition, many couples left after the first group finished
because there was no announcement telling them there was
to be another group.

The cocktail party was another story. Most students as-
sumed the party would begin at the customary hour of 4 p.m.
When they arrived at the Pavillion they found the party had
been in progress for an hour and a half. Even so, those who
wanted something to drink had to wait for ice.

Probably the worst thing that could have happened to a
student at the cocktail party was to get a ticket from the police
for parking on the street. The tow trucks (which we later
learned were to pull cars out of mud) also gave one an in-
secure feeling as to whether his car would be there or not
after the party.

Whar all this boils down to is that it is the responsibility
of the presidents of the weekends to plan them. It is not the
responsibility of the Dance Board (except for the entertain-
ment at concerts). This is why it is especially disappointing
when a weekend like Fancy Dress, which has a national
reputation and is run by a president elected by the student
body, ends up being a fiasco, Past experience shows a little
extra planning and care can make a weekend a memorable
occasion, one which will be looked forward to in the years to
come. Without these elements the weekends will degenerate
into nothing.

Local Tags for Students

We were disturbed at a recent editorial published in the
Lexington News-Gazette, and we wish to reprint it for you
at this time. It appeared under the headline, “Another Source
of Revenue.”

 

“The town of Ashland has obtained an opinion from
the State Attorney General with reference to local tags on
automobiles owned by college students. It applied specifically
to those driven by Randolph-Macon students. The ruling,
however, would be good all over the State.

“The Attorney General stated that the law required
all college students living at the seat of the college for nine
months of the year to affix local tags to their cars. The
residence of the student would determine what tag was
applicable.

“For instance, a student living in Lexington would need
a Lexington City tag and one living in the County would
need a Rockbridge County tag.

“If a Virginia student already had a tag on his car
from a Virginia county or city, a new tag would not be
necessary. But for all others from out of state or from
localities within the State where the car had no local tag,
a tag is called for.

"This has been a question that has come up in Lex-
ington a number of times in the past, and of course the
students have objected to buying the tags. For various
reasons, one being the trouble involved, the letter of the
law has never been enforced here.

“Now, however, with new sources of revenue badly
needed for advancing school costs, water development and
other things, there seems little reason for not enforcing

the use of these tags, and also for not assessing the owners
of the cars with a local property tax on them.”

Thus far, the Lexington City Treasurer has not enforced
this ruling. But if he were to in the future, there would be an
alarming injustice dealt to Washington and Lee students. Ac-
cording to the Virginia Attorney General’s ruling, a person
is considered a resident of a locality if he lives in that locality
for nine months out of the year. On the other hand, we
learned from the City Registrar that one must live in a state
for one year, in a city for six months and a precinct for 30
days before he is eligible to vote. This is according to a statute
in the Virginia Constitution.

In addition, in order for a student to vote in Lexington,
he must, according to the Registrar, file a declaration of per-
sonal property and make a statement that he intends to make
Lexington his permanent home.

The above means, that we, as students and residents of
a Virginia locality, must pay taxes in a locality before we
can even vote there.

No one in the Registrar’s or the Treasuret’s offices was able
to explain this discrepency to us. We do not believe that any-
one can. We can just be thankful that the City Treasurer has
chosen not to enforce this ruling, which would subject the
student body, especially those who own automobiles, to a gross
inequity.

Foul on Sportsmanship

After the brilliant comeback of Washington and Lee’s
basketball team Wednesday night, we have a lot to be proud
of. At the same time, we have a lot to be ashamed about. We
are referring, of course, to the barbarous sportsmanship ex-
hibited by the W&L spectators.

As a school which purports to be the haven of “gentle-
men,” W&L surely did fall short of its claim. Unsportsman-
like activity included swaying arms in the opposing players’
faces during foul shots, pitching pennies toward the opponents’
bench, throwing paper o nthe floor, and, most disgusting of
all, cursing the referees and players to their faces. We can-
not understand why a technical foul was not called against
W&L. We also would not have been surprised if the refrees
had cleared the gym of spectators (a right reserved by the
referees if the spectators are too rowdy).

This lack of sportsmanship may have been just enough
to rile the opponents and allow W&L to win the game. Yet,
we wonder if it was worth it. A Roanoke Times article Thurs-
day quoted the Roanoke coach as saying, “We'll never play
here (W&L) as long I am coach. We didn’t play well enough
to win. . . but there is no excuse for throwing pennies at
our bench.”

This is not the only team which refuses to come to W&L
to play. Large schools which would provide stiff competition
will not travel here. We can’t blame this entirely on the
physical plant of the gymnasium. Much of the blame must
be leveled on the horrible behavior of the students.

It is always encouraging when we see W&L students break
out of their apathetic shells and display some emotion about
something. But if this is the only way in which we can express
ourselves, it may be better just to remain passive.

 

Passavant Outlines
Future Goals of EC

By JAY PASSAVANT
President of Executive Committee
As we begin a new semester, 1

think it would be beneficial for me
to outline the goals of the Executive
Committee for the new term. Logi-
cally, many of the projects begun in
the first semester will be completed
in the near future and in addition,
several new programs will be initiat-
ed. We are on the verge of passing
important legislation in several areas
which will have direct consequence on
the student body.

The Dance Board Investigation
Committee (Bauer and Tompkins)
have thoroughly evaluated all present
Dance Board policies and upon dis-
cussion in the last E.C, meeting pro-
posed several changes from previous
policies. These recommendations were
voted on and passed by the E.C. as
reported in the front page of today’s
Ring-tum Phi.

The proposed Individual Exam
Schedule Resolution (Ogilvie and
Brown) has been approved by the
Executive Committee and is now in
the hands of the Committee on
Courses and Degrees of the faculty.
Details of this plan will be worked
out through our representatives on
the Faculty E.C. and a final report
to be voted on by the faculty should
be forthcoming.

The Student Civil Liberties Com-
mittee under the direction of Jack
Horowitz and Rob Turnbull will give
a preliminary report at the February
10 meeting. The ultimate goal of
this committee is a Student Bill of
Rights to be amended to the Consti-
tution.

Mock OAS
Selects Officers

The Mock Organization of Ameri-
can States, to be held here in mid-
March, has selected most of its
officers and has begun administrative
work in preparation for the event.

Jorge Estrada, senior from Me-
dellin, Colombia, is the chairman of
the Steering Committee. Others on
the committee are Paul Wojcik, (Con-
ference) Secretary-General; Tom
Blanton, (Conference) Assistant Secre-
tary-General; John Motsinger, Chair-
man of Delegations; Pat Arey and
Hank Graddy, Assistant Delegation
Chairmen; and Richard Watt, Steve
Sandler, Mike Nation, and Neil
Kessler.

The ambassadors to the Inter-
American Council are as follows: Jay
Wetsel, Argentina; Richard Watt,
Barados; Bob Gill, Bolivia; Homer
Gamble, Brazil; Walter Sales, Can-
ada (Observer status); Kenn George,
Chile; Alan Stedman, Colombia; Bob
Baroody, Costa Rica; Fran Lawrence,
Cuba (non-voting status); Charlie
Holt and Mike Hosford, Dominican
Republic; Bob Herring, Ecuador; Ray
Hartwell, El Salvador; Tom Metecaff,
Guatemala; Mark Small, Haiti; Justin
Adams, Honduras; Pat Arey, Mexico;

(Continued on Page 4)

 

 

Also regarding the Student Body
Constitution, Joe Tompkins plans to
undertake a program of evaluation
and addition beginning next week. He
will receive aid from one other E.C,
member but any student interested
in assisting Joe should come to the
February 10 EC meeting.

Of primary importance is the work
of the two sub-committees (and the
E.C, as a whole) presently investigat-
ing the present framework of the
Honor System. A student discussion
on this topic is planned in the near
future in the form of a “Bitch-In,”
however this action will be delayed
until a preliminary report of the
L.C, sub-committee is completed. The
final report will be compiled into a
booklet entitled “The Honor System”
which will be distributed to all mem-
bers of the Student Body. It will
contain detailed descriptions of trial
procedure and student rights so that
every student will have the opportun-
ity to better understand the operation
of the Honor System.

Steve Sandler is investigating the
possibility of establishing a reading
clinic here at W&L on a non-credit
basis. He will report on Feb. 17th.

The Curriculum Committee has
been instructed to analyze and evalu-
ate the proposed 12-6-12 program
from the student's viewpoint, This
sub-committee will report to the E.C,
and definite recommendations will be
made, Alternative changes in the cur-
riculum may be proposed.

The value of the VASG will be
definitely determined in the next six
months and a decision by our stu-
dent government as to whether or not
to participate will be made.

Dean Kumpuris and Joe Tompkins
are engaged in a study of the opera-
tion of the Co-op with plans to
investigate longer hours, prices and
more student jobs.

The points that have been men-
tioned are by no means the only
ones that will be studied this semester.
Other issues of considerable import-
ance will most likely be discussed
later in the spring or when oppor-
tunities for their study arise. One
point | would like to make is that
the representation granted the EC in
faculty and administration — last
semester should prove to be of con-
siderable importance in determining
policies for the future. Joint meet-
ings with the faculty EC as well as
a permanent student member on the
faculty EC, regular reports to the
faculty and in fact representation of
the Student Body at the next Board
of Trustees Meeting should prove of
immeasurable value in attaining the
previously outlined goals,

In keeping with the EC’s effort to
make a student government a more
inclusive affair, | would encourage
your attendance to every EC meeting
and particularly those at which you
feel you have a viewpoint that should
be heard. Meetings are held every
Monday at 7:15 p.m. in the Student
Union. If you feel the goals presented
are not ambitious enough or that
you can add to our efforts, we wel-
come your atiendance,

 

By RODDY RODIGER
and DAVE SCHUSTER

A student rating of the faculty was
made in early December as a re-
search project for a course. This
study has caused quite a bit of mis-
understanding which needs to be
cleared up, In no way was this study
an attempt to attack the faculty in
general or certain members of it,

Actually the rating of individual
members was peripheral to our main
task, which was to examine the re-
lationship between a number of fac-
tors, ¢.g. grade in course and rating
of the professor. However, in the
process of obtaining these data indi-
vidual ratings of professors were also
obtained.

On a random basis, 141 seniors
received the questionnaire, and 118
(84%) were completed and returned
to us, On a five point seale, each
student rated each of his teachers at
Washington and Lee (and who are
still on the faculty) on six criteria:
1) Lectures—interesting, stimulating;
2) Lectures—well-organized, under-
standable: 3) Quizzes and Exams—
fair, reasonable; 4) Encourages cre-
ative thinking: 5) Knowledge of sub-
ject; 6) Overall performance of pro-
fessor

Without going into the laborious
statistical details, a few of our find-
ings can be noted. In the first place,
ii is interesting to note that neither
GPR nor grade in the course cor-
related highly with the rating of the
professor, In other words, the rat
ings students gave professors cannot
be explained by the grades the pro

 

fessor gave the students

 

Another finding is that the students
were, on the whole, too lenient, The
rating scale was 1-5, with 1 being
“Superior,” 2—"Good,.” 3—"Aver-
age,” 4—"Poor” and $—‘Terrible.”
The students were told to rate each
faculty member in relation to all
others he had, So the mean score
for the entire faculty for each criter-
ion should be “Average,” Le., 3. For
five of the six criteria the average

Students’ Project Grades

faculty's “knowledge” anyway. All the
other averages (except one) on criteria
for the whole faculty ranged between
2.40 and 2.65,

The exception is “Encourages crea-
tive thinking,” where the faculty re-
ceived a mean rating of 3.23, This
is very interesting, especially since
almost every study attempting to de-
termine what students want most in
a teacher have indicated that some

(mean) is lower, and thus more fav-| factor resembling “Encourages crea-

orable to the faculty. Knowledge of
subject was best (1.75), understand-
ably enough, since it is rather pre-

interested in learning, only out for
a gentleman's C or B, etc, The blame
has been variously placed, often on
the fraternity system or Rush Week.
Perhaps attention should be turned
in another direction, ic, back on the
faculty and the lecture system. The
lecture system by its very nature
encourages non-involvement, or al
best a passive involvement with what
is going on. How can this encourage
creative thinking? Perhaps those few
professors (10) who had superior rat-
ings for encouraging creative think-
ing are the ones who can really make
the lecture system work effectively, of
who have given it up altogether. At
any the fault does not lie, as
we see it, entirely with the students

When we collected the individ.
ual ratings of faculty members we
were very hopeful that something
constructive could be done with
them, We hoped that individual
faculty members would use the rat-
ings us student critiques and would
perhaps take them inte account
when trying to rework their courses
and lectures, More to the point,
it is hoped faculty members would
see where the students think they
are performing poorly and would
try to improve. This is, perhaps,
being fantastically idealistic, I was
decided that publishing the entire
list of faeulty ratings would not
serve our purpose and would only
make the low scorers defensive and
resentful. Instead we are report
ing only the “Superior” ratings.

noke coach, Charles Moir, did not
seem to have much to leave Doremus
with except possibly a few unpleasant
memories and a few pennies thrown
at him by the slightly infuriated fans.
The Roanoke Times quoted Moir as
saying he never wanted to come
back to Washington and Lee. Part of
the reason was of course the 49-47
loss to the Generals, although the
crowd played no small part in his
decision.

The first half opened with some
weak officiating and a number of
W&L turnovers which all added up
to a Roanoke advantage during the
entire first half. Jumping out to an
8-2 lead with five minutes gone, Roa-
noke forced W&L into taking a time
out to reassess its game strategy. After
that the Maroons built their lead to
ten points which was about the way
it stayed until the half when the
score was 22-32,

An amazing transformation seemed
to take place in the fifteen minutes
between the halves. Washington and
Lee opened up with a blaze of scor-
ing that brought them within four
points, 33-37 with 13:08 left, when
Roanoke called time. Roanoke then
completed a three point play to raise
their lead to seven. Shortly after-

Almost without notice, the Wash-

team will resume competition for the

In contests before exams, the rifle
team ran up a 4-1 record. Victories
were scored over George Washington,
Richmond, Virginia, and William and

ball downcourt and quickly popped
one in, then turned around, stole the
ball and put in a not-so-easy lay-up
to make the score 37-40, still the
Maroons’ advantage. Roanoke then
called time out with 10:51 remaining
to play.

With 7:37 remaining the score stood
at 41-44 and W&L lost the ball on a
three second violation and Roanoke
capitalized on the mistake making
the score 41-46, With 6:45 left Mike
Daniel put in a free throw to make
the score 42-46.

Roanoke stole the ball, after W&L
missed the second foul shot, and was
called for walking, W&L taking pos-
session. W&L then missed a shot and
Roanoke called time after getting the
rebound with 5:33 left to play the
score still 42-46.

A quick exchanged followed the
time out with Neer intercepting the
ball an dthen losing it, and the
Maroons immediately turning it over
again for walking. Cartwright then
scored to pull the deficit to two points.
Roanoke missed its next shot, Mike
Daniel grabbing the rebound, and the
Generals called time with 3:59 re-
maining with the score 44-46,

After the Generals stalled for a
short time, Neer put in a basket with
3:36 remaining, but it was disallowed.
With the ball, Frank Allen of Roa-
noke was fouled and made one shot
putting the score at 44-47 Roanoke,
when the Generals called time, 2:39
remaining. Washington and Lee kick-
ed the ball out of bounds and Roa-
noke got possession but again failed
to score. Then Mike Daniel missed a
foul shot after he was fouled down-
court,

Roanoke seemed to be powerless
without Frank Allen and could not
put the ball in the basket. With 54

Spring Football Practice Begins
Wednesday Afternoon on Wilson

Football candidates will report for
“spring” football practice Wednesday,
February 12, hoping for good weather
during the two and a half weeks of
workouts.

National Collegiate Athletic As-

sociation rules allow college teams 20 |

practice sessions in the spring semes-
ter, primarily to integrate freshmen
into the school’s system. As most
of the General freshmen are already
familiar with the varsity system,
spring football at W&L is a chance
to work out some kinks, get in some
contact work and make additions or
deletions in the offenses and defenses.

Spring practice is traditionally held
at Washington and Lee early in the
second semester to accomodate other
coaches of spring sports. Football
coach Buck Leslie is expecting to see
most of the faces that will be eligible
for next season and hoping that the
mild weather will continue. In the
past, spring practice has been plagued
by snow, but last year the weather
was perfect and there is hope that

 

 

 

Boyd Williams who will be looking
for some fearsome foursome types to
replace his graduating ends and
tackles. The linebacking corps is
stocked with talent, and the defensive
backfield is also full of veterans.
On offense, Coach Leslie will see
almost all of last year’s regulars with
one glaring exception. The Generals
will need to find a replacement for
senior Bucky Cunningham, a sure-
handed star the past two seasons,
All players are asked to report to
the stadium dressing room at 3:30 on
Wednesday and practices will be held
that day and Thursday of the first
week. Then the next two weeks,
practices will be held Monday through
Friday, culminating in an encounter
with an alumni squad on March 1.

“The way
I see it’

(Editor's note: “The way I see it”
is a column of general editorial
comment for which contributions
are solicited from students and
faculty concerning any topic. The
opinions expressed in this column
do not necessarily represent those
of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi.)

By SWEDE HENBERG

Curriculum Committee Chairman

During the first part of this
semester, the Faculty Curriculum
Committee will present its recom-

mendations for curricular changes to
the faculty as a whole. Although the
details are not yet completely work-
ed out, the general outline of the
plan entails a revision of the uni-
versity calendar. Switching from the
present two semester system, the com-
mittee’s plan calls for three periods
of study, two of twelve weeks, and
one of six weeks. An outline of
this proposal appeared some time ago
in an interview with Dr. Roberts in
the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi.

It is not my intention to give
either a summary or an evaluation
of the Faculty Committee's proposal.
After the proposal has gone to the
faculty, the Student Curriculum Com-
mittee will present its own report to
the Executive Committee so that it
can consider a recommendation of its
own. The entire situation is com-
plex, and I hesitate to give any
abbreviated criticism of the Faculty
Committee’s proposal for two rea-
sons, First of all I don’t want to
give the impression that the proposal
now taking shape will pass in its
entirety.

Undoubtedly there will be emenda-
tions and deletions right up to the
time a certain aspect of the proposal
is voted. I am afraid that giving a
summary of the proposal might lead
seme people to the conclusion that
all decisions have been made and
that all we need wait for is the
faculty's vote on the composite pro-
posal. The actual situation is that
the plan is still tentative, it’s recom-
mendations fluid. The plan will not
receive a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ vote for its
entirety; it will rather be broken down
and voted on in sections in order to
promote the more acceptable aspects.

In addition to avoiding the im-
pression that evertyhing is final and
will definitely pass, | hesitate to
summarize because of the complexity
of the whole plan. Unless it were
possible to devote an entire issue of
the Ring-tum Phi to the subject of
the curriculum, there would be many
aspects of the plan that would not
receive attention, Just the mere fact
of revising the University Calendar

especially that tonight in Lee Chapel,
Jack Thomas, a black militant stu-
dent will be speaking and that Senator
McGovern’s speech will be in Lee
Chapel and not in Doremus Gym-
nasium as previously announced,

Besides Jack Thomas and Senator
McGovern this year’s Contact pro-
gram includes Phillippe Labro, Ralph
Lapp, Charles Evers, Walter Adams
and John R. Silber. Jack Thomas, 21,
is a member of the Black Action
Council of West Chester, Penn. His
concept of black power moves de-
mands from the street into more
formal, legitimate political channels.

Phillippe Labro, one of France's
major journalists, will discuss the out-
breaks of May 1968 in France. Labro
is presently a feature writer and rov-
ing reporter for “France-Soir,”
France’s largest evening newspaper.
Charles Evers will still be present in
the Contact program contrary to
rumors of his cancellation yesterday.
Evers is a dynamic civil right leader
in the NAACP in Mississippi.

to society. A frequent topic of his
books concerns the U.S.’s_ military
power and nuclear war.

to rebroadcast the Contact speeches
beginning February 23 with Phillippe
Labro’s speech and concluding with
Senator McGovern’s talk on Friday,

After Sam Hinkle’s report, the IFC
spent the remainder of its session dis-
cussing the SAC and the faculty in
relation to several needed reforms
it has proposed. Clark Carter re-
ported that the faculty had requested
the SAC to investigate the living
conditions in the dormitories and
therefore, consideration of the IFC's
request to modify the pareital rules
relating to girls above the first floor
had to be postponed.

IFC treasurer, Mark Eaker then
moved that fraternities be allowed to
have combo parties on Friday even-
ing. The present regulations, passed
during the era of the 6-day week,
do not allow Friday night combos
except on one of the big weekends.
It was stated that for the IFC to
change any of its social regulations,
a petition had to be first sent to the
SAC where it would ultimately be
sent on to the faculty with or with-

out a recommendation, The IFC then |

unanimously passed Eaker’s motion
which would present the change to
the SAC and ultimately to the fac-
ulty,

In one of its shorter meetings of
the year, the Executive Committee
last night voted unanimously to
recommend to the faculty EC that
a reading day be provided in May
between the last day of classes and
the first day of exams. In other
action, Dean Kumpuris and Joe
Tompkins were directed to continue
their study of the Co-op as a pos-
sible locus of student employment;
direction was provided for action in
future weeks on Mock Convention
debts, the OAS, and constitutional
revision. No one was absent from the
meeting.

The recommendation concerning a
reading day came after a motion by
Steve Sandler, the student EC repre-
sentative to the faculty EC. Sandler
said that at the last faculty EC meet-
ing he attended, no satisfactory re-
sponse was tendered to his query
about the reason for the present back-
to-back scheduling of classes and
exams next May. Briefly considered
and tentatively dropped for logistical
reasons was a suggestion that a stu-
dent petition be gathered requesting

 

ever, may reconsider this proposal if
its recommendation brings no results
in the faculty EC.

Dean Kumpuris and Joe Tomp-
kins, who have been studying the
feasibility of student employment in
the Co-op, reported that there were
several problems involved—the main
ones were the relation of the Co-op
to the University and the adverse re-
action such suggestions may have up-
on those who are presently employed
there. Jay Passavant made it clear,

In 1987, Richard Wilbur won both
the Pultizer Prize and the National

establishment of a weekend in March,
the sales of Dance Plans throughout
the year and of individual tickets to
WAL students before each concert,
the non-transferability of Dance Plans,
the elimination of monetary renum-

weekend presidents (but to the latter

only for the specific weekend in-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Editorial responsibility

Jay Passavant announced last month a decision made by |
the EC in executive session on January 6, that comments |
from the floor would no longer be entertained during regular |
meetings. This ruling has precedent in governmental legisla-
tive procedure and is designed to prevent Executive Com-
mittee sessions from becoming disjointed and protracted |
debates.

Such a measure will effectively reduce immediate exchanges
between EC members and other students, except when specific
proposals are introduced (which obviously cannot be done at
each meeting). And so public-affairs-minded students may well
question their ability to be heard by their governors, quite a
legitimate worry.

Providing an answer to that question is one of the justi-
fications for the existance of The Ring-tum Phi. Ideally, here
the interplay will take its most potent, permanent form: in
print. Unfortunately, few have taken advantage of this news-
paper as a vehicle of opinion—an example is the failure of
students to take advantage of “The way I see it.” Another
example is the apparent unwillingness of many brilliant and
diversely interested students to put forth their ideas—on any-
thing—in the paper.

In an effort to promote student interest in campus affairs
and to further establish The Ring-tum Phi as a genuine forum,
we have granted two columnist positions, one to Jack Horowitz
and one to Larry Hilliard. Their perquisites will be the con-,
cession to write anything they choose, no restrictions, pro-
vided 1) they write an article every Tuesday and 2) they
turn it in on time. The only other attachment to these liberal
conditions is that the editor may remove a columnist after four
issues.

Hopefully Messrs. Horowitz and Hilliard will not, as we
will not, be everyone’s friend. Perhaps their candor and well
placed barbs will elicit response and some needed thought or
even action.

We choose not, incidentally, to demean our two columnists
with The Ring-tum Phi’s standard apology “. . . not necessarily
represent...” There is one place where the editorial opinion
of this edition may be found: in the editorials. After that we
are the students’ newsaper. That’s our job. Make us earn
our pay.

The Dance Board {II}

The Executive Committee’s action on Dance Board affairs
last week was well planned, well considered, and necessary.
And Jay Passavant has indicated the Board will be subject to
continued scrutiny. The measures taken to date, however, fall

“somewhat short of what is needed.

We will not join those who scorn every move of the
Dance Board—some of its leaders, notably president Jim
Livesay, have made imaginative improvements in running the
concerts. But the organization of the Board is a social and
political anachronism,

‘63 Dean Kumpuris knew at the end of his sophomore
year that he would be Dance Board president in his senior
year. We do not know enough of Board affairs to pass judg-
ment on Mr. Kumpuris, but there is a definite error in any
system of this nature which bypasses consideration of applicants
beyond a certain (very early) time and which excludes mem-
bership from all but a select group of fraternities.

‘@5 The president of the Dance Board has almost un-
checked control over the use of funds. Certainly Professor
Phillips, advisor, can (and does) exert considerable influence
on financial matters. Last year’s Board, however, spent $7,-
319.91 more than it earned, solely at the discretion of its
president. We are not presuming to say that Messrs. Livesay
and Kumpuris will do the same—but they have the power to,
which is unfortunate.

‘@5 Escalating costs of performers have devastated the
Board’s ability to provide four enjoyable weekends a year.
Responses have not progressed past the stage of settling for
less exciting (and very often poorer) entertainment. A more
rational solution, one which this newspaper suggested in
October, would be to eliminate one of the weekends.

The Dance Board will have to undergo some considerable
changes to justify its continued existence in the form as we
know it now. Executive Editor Reed Byrum has made an ex-
haustive study of all aspects of the Board and presents his
initial findings in today’s paper. Hopefully those in authority
will view our thoughts as they are intended, constructively,
designed to protect the student body’s interest and investment.

Criticism of Dance Board
is attacked as unjustified

Exam revision; some questions

There are definite merits in doing away with the present
system of administering final examinations. These tests are
such a large part of the final grade that students are justifiably
concerned over the arbitrary assignment of the day on which
each exam must be taken. The Executive Committee’s solution
to this problem, though better than the present system, is not
much of a boon to students and is too much of a burden on
the faculty.

The most formidable criticism is the same as the one
levied against the abolishment of Saturday classes. Are there
any educational benefits? As is now stands, no. The exam pe-
riod would be a full two days shorter, with the addition of a few
days afterwards for grading. This in effect allows a student to
omit, for studying purposes, only three days from the period.
And after exams are over—then what? Every student gets
four free days. Personally, we would rather have these days
during the exam period for studying, even if they were ran-
domly and arbitrarily placed.

Neither does it appear a good idea to fix schedules two
weeks in advance. Why not let a student decide his next
exam whenever he chooses—even the night before—and have
them distributed on this basis. The argument in favor of the
two-week predetermination is that the faculty would be more
likely to accept the proposals since a student could not pro-
crastinate to the point of a crisis situation. This is ridiculous.
If the faculty places no more faith in students than to rely on
such measures, then we don’t deserve an independent schedul-
ing system anyway.

And without intending to demean the thorough job done
by the EC committee which formalized the exam proposal,
the process of procuring an exam seems a bit tedious. There
are far too many slips and pacquets to sign and countersign
at Mary Baldwin; why must we parrot their system? Per-
haps Hollins College provides a better basis, allowing its stu-
dents to receive any examination from a central administration
area at any prescribed time. The girls sign the exams out, take
them, then sign them back in. What else is needed?

It is obvious that there should be some reform. We heartily
stand behind the Executive Committee for formalizing one
of the ideas of last year’s junior representative Herb Crenshaw.
But the commitment to reform carries with it the obligation
to achieve that reform as simply as possible.

Executive Editor

Once again, the quarterly criticism
ot the Dance Board has been res-
surected upon this campus: it always
happens after every big weekend and
has yet to have become a passe
activity.

But the ten men who plan the
dance sets many months in advance
and who sacrifice their time, their
pleasure, and the company of their
dates to complete final preparations
for the concerts receive little thanks
and much ballyhoo. No one has yet
to appreciate the seemingly vain
eflorts of these people, although
about eleven hundred students and
their dates inevitably attend the con-
certs and enjoy, apparently only for
the moment, the fruits of the Dance
Board's labors. The actions should
justifiably overrule the verbal dis-
sension, yet quite paradoxically they
don't: criticism still reigns and goes
uncontested.

Now, the critics have delved far
beneath the surface of the weekends
and are concentrating upon the fi-
nances, the structure, and the admin-
istration of the Board, After the
most comprehensive study, I feel that
this is but the “sound and fury,
signfying nothing,” of the ever dis-
enchanted and dissatisfied. Yet too
many people listen to the critics, while
remaining deaf to the defenders:
this article will attempt to shed light
upon some of the fallacies purported
by the cynics and to salvage the
tarnished reputation of the Board,

Perhaps the most widespread claim
launched against the Board by the
student body is its choice of enter-
tainment, This group employs Stan
Rubin, an entertainer himself, to book
all of the concerts; contrary to popu-
lar belief, he is able to obtain any
individual or group in the business,
from Sammy Davis Jr, and Aretha
Franklin to the Airplane and the
Holding Company. But WAL is great
ly restriced in its choice of per-
formers by a lack of sufficient funds,
and the students will have to under-
stand that they are getting the best
available for the money which they
set forth. Students must also realize
that for a much larger amount of
money they could obtain anyone

whom they wished, but then again,
this is both impratical and idealistic
Leven to hope for

 

In the same vein, students ex-
plode when groups fail to appear for
the concerts and heap their wrath
upon the Dance Board, quite un-
justifiably. However, the Board can't
be blamed for the actions of the
entertainers, as they are the ones who
cause all of the trouble. Performers
usually book two or three other shows
for the same date and wait until
the last minute to choose which one
they shall attend, that is, the one
which will pay the most. WAL has
been most fortunate in having as
many groups as it has to show for
the amount of money it offers. In
fact, last year we had only two
last minute cancellations, this figure
one half of the number which Rubin
had during the entire year. So per-
haps we aren't as unlucky as we are
led to believe; whatever, it is de-
finitely not the fault of the Board
or our agent for the actions of the
entertainers themselves,

Rubin saved the loss of the Four} —

Tops in October when he stopped

them from going to Lexington, Ken-| 7

tucky instead of its Virginia counter-
part. Little is usually ever heard of
such things as this, but it is often
when the agent or a member of the
Dance Board goes out of his way to
secure an appearance of a performer.

Iwo big problems exist in con-
tracting performers aside from fi-
nances, The first is the location of
Lexington: it is very much off the
main drag and is extremely incon-
venient for groups to get efficient
transportation to and from the town,
Also, it is not on the paths of most
entertainers when they make tours
through the South, mostly because of
the location of our town, The next
hindrance is that of having four fixed
dates each year. Many times a con-
flict with a certain group is created,
because they may be making a tour
of another region and may not want
to go oul of their way just to appear
in Lexington; it would be both im-
practical and inconvenient for them
to do this.

The finances of the Dance Board
represent another big point of con-
tention of the critics, The lack of
funds is the most outstanding eco-
monic hindrance of the Board, and
many measures are being taken to
solve this dilemma

Last Saturday was a red letter day
in the annals of Washington and
Lee history. For the first time there
were no Saturday classes. WAL took
a giant step into twentieth century
education when the faculty voted for
the five-day week. But several other
changes should also be made at this
dowdy old University.

The curriculum needs to be mod-
ernized and expanded, the University
needs new facilities, especially a new
gymnasium, the University should
fully integrate, and most intriguingly,
the University should take steps to-
ward coeducation.

There is absolutely no reason why
Washington and Lee should not be
a coeducational institution, And the
benefits would be numerous.

By barring almost 40 per cent of
the country’s collegiate community,

 

the University is denying admission
io many students who could make a
significant contribution to all facets

of University life. And how about
all the males who will not even
consider WAL. because the thought of
going to an all men’s college revolts
them?

The myth that females cannot

compete scholastically with males has
been exploded at all coeducational
universities, Extracurricular activities
would also benefit greatly from the

 

contributions of talented young ladies
Wouldn't it be nice to turn on WLUR

 

and hear the pleasing tones of a soft,
feminine voice?

But it is in the realm of social life
that females would make their most
obvious contribution. And who could
possibly say this is bad? Let's face
it, a society without females is an
unnatural society.

111-83 Saturday

by Asheville-Biltmore’s Bulldogs

Saturday Washington and Lee's
basketball squad suffered its worst
setback of the season at the hands |
of Asheville-Billmore 111-83

Bulldogs were

led by Micky Gibson,
previously was high

not be stopped from making 44
points, He had amazing strength and

hit shots consistently from 30 feet
even while closely guarded. Another
Asheville-Biltmore player, Healey,

showed power on the boards and in
addition the victorious Bulldogs had

quick and agressive guards. A full
court press throughout most of the
sume took its toll on the Generals

Asheville-Bilimore kept such tre
mendous pressure on Washington and
Lee that the Bulldogs stole the ball
frequently, The also had
an amazing high-geared offense which

the first period. From then on Wash-
ington and Lee could not play its
control type of offense, but was forced
to play Asheville-Biltmore’s game—
run and gun,

Despite the 28 point margin, Mike
Neer played his second straight out-
standing game. Mike collected 33
points. Mike was the mainstay of
Washington and Lee's rebounding
}gume once again. Even with Neer’s
exciting play however, the Generals
simply could not contain their op-
ponent’s lightning-quick offense.

But the determining factor was that
Washington and Lee could not play
the kind of game it wanted to play

Saturday night simply wasn't a good
one for WAL's basketball team. Our
Generals seemed to have trouble
getting started, while Asheville-Bilt

wright and Neer snatching most of
the missed attempts.

Coach Canfield’s perfected match-
up defense forced the opposition to
take numerous poor shots. Mean-
while, the Generals drove against the
Green Terrors at will, with Neer
working at either high or low post.
Midway through the period W&L
started to shell WMC from outside,
which caused the lead to jump to
double figures.

After a brief break for half Wash-
ington and Lee stormed back out to
combine hot shooting with rebounding
strength. WMC’s rebounding increas-
ed considerably in the final period,
but so did the rebounding done by
the Generals, who held the Terrors
to 31 for 82 from the floor while
WMC's man-to-man defense only held
the Generals to 34 for 63, or 54%.

As a team the Generals showed the
success of their control, offense and
hustling defense. Four men on the
squad were in double figures. “Magic”
Mel Cartwright scored 15, making
drives and reverse lay-ups against two
and three defenders. Morrison hit for
14 points of which six baskets were
form the 20-25 foot range.

Fauber also made 14 points and
showed strength on the boards and
on drives, Charlie Stone connected
for 5 and displayed his passing and
dribbling talent. Mike Daniel and
Earl Edwards came off the bench
early in the game to score 7 and 2
points respectively.

The Washington and Lee squad
has shown how good it really is in
the last three wins over Navy, Roa-

noke and Western Maryland. The
biggest question left for the squad

is how well can it do on the road
without the home court advantage.

_ Sports in General .

Assistant Sports Editor
“We're very optimistic about the
future, but we're also very proud

of our accomplishments.” Those were
the words of Washington and Lee’s
young and dynamic head basketball
coach, Verne Canfield.

Coach Canfield has been instru-
mental in transforming W&L’s basket-
ball squad from a push-over to a
Virginia small college power. In the
last two seasons his teams have had
records of 20-5 and 19-6 and in
addition they have won the C.A.C.
Championship each year,

This season

Canfield is proud to claim.

Why is Washington and Lee hav-
ing such a fine season? According to
the coach, “Our boys have a great
deal of pride, not only in their team
but also in Washington and Lee.
Each of the players has been getting
his job done well, especially Mike
Neer, who has had some exceptional
games recently in terms of scoring.”

When asked about the controversial
Roanoke College game, Coach Can-
field had several things to set straight
“Despite what the Roanoke papers
said, the crowd didn’t win the game
for Washington and Lee—the team
did. | don't mean to say the crowds
don't help, because they do and I'm
happy to see so many people con
cerned about our team, But I don't

Coach Canfield then went on to
give his thoughts about the rest of
the season. “If we win our next two
games we'll be the Virginia small
college champions, which would be
quite an accomplishment when you
consider all the subsidized schools in
the state. At the beginning of the
season we had six tough games on
the schedule. Only one of these games
is lefti—the Quantico Marines, a very
talented ball club.”

“Our team has done a good job

Number one is winning the state

Coach Canfield was quite frank

WAL is centered around the car and
the fraternity, an unfortunate situa-
tion for students lacking either or
both. The rat race of “going down
the road” every weekend is a far
from satisfactory social life.

Obviously the W&L physical plant
cannot presently facilitate a coeduca-
tional University. But additions, some
needed with or without coeducation,
could be made to allow coeducation
within three years. Until that time,
W&L could follow the lead of Prince-
ton and Yale in bringing in girls for
week long visits as interested—and
interesting—observers. Another pos-
sibility would be consolidation with
one of the nearby women’s colleges.

Society no longer attempts to
separate the sexes. W&L shouldn't
either if it hopes to be a_ truly
twentieth century institution,
Dance Board

(Continued from Page 2)

More practical methods of arrang-
ing the gym for concerts have now
been employed, the main one being
that the members of the Advisory
Board set up the tarp which covers
the gym. The salary of the president
has now been eliminated, and now
only the officers of the Board receive
free dance plans.

Studies are now being undertaken
to discover a more profitable way of
selling tickets, such that one day
individual tickets will be sold to stu-
dents. One idea is that tickets be
offered to the area schools, so that
more people will have the opportunity
to purchase a ticket. Also, the idea
of coordinating a concert with another
local college is being considered; this
would undoubtedly secure a large
number of students and make indi-
vidual tickets sales more realistic.

The financial situation could now
only be worsened if individual tickets
were sold and dance plans were made
transferrable, thus causing a lack of
ready cash. With transferrable plans
students would not be as inclined to
buy them, rather sharing them or
purchasing them jointly, If individual
tickets were available, the Board
would not have the needed cash on
hand to pay groups in advance; also,
if a group were somewhat unpopular
or if the weekend conflicted with a
more appealing one at another school,
the loss of income would be so drastic
as to impair or eliminate one of the
other dance sets.

The Board is also doing all that
it can to improve the quality of the
concerts. First of all, it is attempting
to obtain the use of the VMI Field-
house for Springs; the acoustics would
be better, the viewing would be more
pleasurable, the fire hazards would
be eliminated, and the capacity would
be increased. Through preferential
sheets, they are trying to discover
what type of entertainment the stu-
dent body wishes. In this way they
can book acts which would prove
most appealing to the audiences,

The last main point of dispute is
its structure. The main criticism here
is that of its self-perpetuation of its
membership, which comes actually
from lack of interest more than fra-
ternity inbreeding. The Dance Ad-
visory Board was created to serve as
a proving ground for future mem-
bers, but few applications for posi-
tions on the Dance Board come from
this group. Thus, it can be easily
premised that only a certain group
of people are so oriented as to want
to join the Board, definitely not most
people.

The second point of criticism con-
cerns the election of the vice-presi-
dent, who unquestionably ascends to
the presidency. First of all the vice-
president is selected as an understudy
of the president, so that he will
understand how to handle the many
problems which are involved in plan-
ning concerts, Next, it is an assurance
that an upper-classman will remain
on the Board, so that he will be
able to relay his experience to the
younger members of the group.

I can thus only conclude that
most of the criticism against the
Dance Board up to this time has
been nonfactual and has been based
mostly upon opinion. The Board is
making a consistent and conscienti-
ous effort to improve its shortcom-
ings and is attempting to please the
students to the best of its ability, The
amount of criticism has been wholly
unjustified in proportion to the great
amount of time and labor which is
given by these ten men, and gratitude,
rather than insult, should be given
to the Board for the inglorious duty
which it accomplishes to the best of
its ability.

movement in 1964—once a philosophy
major at Berkeley—describes the at-
titude of the administration as one
of men who think that history has
stopped: all constructive and worth-
while changes already embraced; room
for no more. And so the leaders at
SF State with actions of boycott and
disruption tell the administrators that
they will be allowed to ignore the
thrust for change no longer.

The cause embraced by these leaders
at SF State is the destruction of the
administrative aspects of higher edu-
cation in the state: a return to the
community of scholars ... The high
and middle roads of the tri-parte

American mind—all comfortably
within the system—will issue the call:
“clear the campus, get back to

schoolin,.” Even the old left will
write articles in the NY Times ad-
vising activity through channels, And
never will any of these advisors get
alt why these students are endanger-
ing their status as members of the
releative utopian found within the
groves of acadame: TOO OFTEN IN

Today the status quo includes a
radical student left, making their
presence known, Now what is to be
done?

The honest concern for a_ better
way that motivates most of these
radicalized students must be acknow-
ledged. If these students allow the
end to justify the means, look to the
response afforded them when they
did operate within the system. If
minds were closed even to the pos-
sibility that they were presenting
valid alternatives, if fellow students,
teachers, and administrators attempted
io impose what was thought to be
better judgment on them, can these
radical dissentors now be blamed for
turning the tables?

EC report

(Continued from Page 1)
Horowitz, chairman of the Student
Civil Liberties Committee, would not
be forthcoming with his recommenda-
tions until just before Spring Vaca-
tion. Phil Thompson suggested Horo-
witz focus on philosophies and mea-
sures germaine to the needs of the
WAL campus instead of directing its
inquiries to other schools.

On the matter of the initiation of
a speed-reading clinic for W&L stu-
dents—free—Steve Sandler suggested
the EC contact an employee of The
Evelyn Wood School of Reading
Dynamics who lives in Buena Vista
and inquire as to the availability of
her services. Sandler noted the recent
solicitations made by that organiza-
tion, but said though the course was
reputed to be excellent, it was also
expensive (ca, $125 per pupil).

Jay Passavant referred to the Bitch-
in, out of which came suggestions
for constitutional revision, in asking
Joe Thompkins to join Dean Kum-
puris and Dave Shufflebarger to
examine the student body's constitu-
tion for conclusiveness, degree of
coverage, timeliness, and relevance to
the student body of today.

The Virginia Association of Stu-
dent Governments will meet on Thurs-
day, Feb. 20, at Hampden-Sidney,
where Dean Rusk is tentatively sched-
uled to speak. Rob Turnbull, Rob
Bauer, Joe Thompkins, Danny Lean-
ard, and Passavant will attend.

Rob Bauer reported on a sug-
gestion that films be shown in duPont
Hall to the student body on a regular
basis. He said that Journalism Prof.
Jennings could provide services in
obtaining films and had a massive
listing of all films available, ranging
in price from $25 to $100 plus show-
ing and attendance surchages. The
problem connected with such an en-

 

terprise is the financing. Several
showings of one film a month could
be done for about $1,500, but unless
the University would be willing to
underwrite the effort (the EC is look-
ing into that), then an assessment
would have to be made at the begin-
ning of school, and admission
charge of 25 cents levied.

Some mention was made of the
Southern Collegian’s having collected
funds at the beginning of the year and
then having not so far issued a
magazine, but the EC is powerless to
act in such an extra-University mat-
ter.

Jorge Estrada: “Where can I start?”

Jay Passavant: “Well, you can
start with what happened to our $50.”
[Laughter.]

Such was the beginning of Estrada’s
appearance before the EC. He said
the money had been used in cor-
respondence to 63 schools soliciting
delegations to the Mock OAS. So far,
7 replies have come. Estrada said
that although he was disappointed in
the lack of interest shown, especially
by Virginia schools, he expected 7 or
8 more acceptances to come in. The
balance of the 21 delegation council
would be provided by Washington
and Lee students,

Scheduled for appearance before
the EC next week are Swede Hen-
berg (Curriculum Committee Chair-
man), Bill Gottwald (for the As-
similation Committee), and Hank
Graddy, Ken Cribb, Guy Glenn, and
Ron Kessler (concerning Mock Con-
vention debts). The EC is presently
accepting applications for positions on
the 1972 Mock Convention, includ-
ing 2 freshman positions as Interim
Co-chairmen. They should be mailed
to Jay Passavant at the Pi Kappa
Alpha House. —Larry Honig

time over the Stonewall Jackson
Hospital. It dropped another “bomb”
which fell soundlessly to the earth,
then gathered up speed and headed
off to “attack” Roanoke.

The neighbors on Taylor St. tried
hard, but could not come up with
any reasonable explanation of the
phenomenon. Many of them had
thought that it might be a meteor,
however, the fact that it was cloudy
both nights seemed to rule out that
possibility, especially because the
UFO was seen from so far off. The
fireball was suspended well up in the
air, so it couldn’t have been a police
or ambulance flasher. Not to men-
tion that fire trailed behind it.

The whole affair was given official
credence the following night, Janu-
ary 18. While patrolling the streets
on duty, a policeman from the Bed-
ford, Va. Sheriff's Office sighted
another red fiery UFO flashing across
the skies, The officer first thought that
it was an airplane, but then the
object exploded in mid-air and dis-
appeared. The Sheriff's Office report-
ed that “the officer went over to the
area where it exploded but he couldn't
find anything.” In the three weeks
since the UFO was seen, the Bedford
Sheriff has yet to come up with a
lead. No traces of an exploded ob-
ject have been found, and the fire-

ball which the officer described
matches that of the UFO seen in
Lexington,

Nothing more has been heard of
the “saucer” since the explosion on
the 18th. It might seem very funny
to dismiss the reports as the product
of individual imaginations, but there
were nearly twenty people who saw
the UFO in Lexington.

‘Let’s Look at Ourselves

Every week as I write editorials for this newspaper, I
find the need to be completely objective. That is, I cannot
let my emotions rule my thoughts. Whatever I say must be
backed by concrete evidence. Often, however, there are things
I want to get off my chest—things which bother me and are
very much a part of me. Such is the case this week, as I drop
all editorial decorum and relate to you my reactions toward
the speeches of the first three CONTACT speakers.

Each of these speakers had key sentences in his talk
which made me reflect on myself—my purpose, my goals, my
life, my education. The words I quote from Dr. Ralph Lapp,
a research physicist, came from his speech Wednesday night.
He said ‘‘Let’s look at the earth before we look at the moon;
let’s look at ourselves.” Phillippe Labro, a French newspaper
reporter, said Wednesday afternoon, “To act as an adult
has always posed problems, whereas obedience and conformity
never do.”’ The shortest, but probably most disturbing sentence
came from black militant Jack Thomas Tuesday night. He
said, “I distrust all whites.”’

I see each of these sentences as raising serious questions
and doubts for myself. First of all, if I look at myself, what do
I see? Do I see a Washington and Lee student trying to
play a role, or do I see myself as a part of society with certain
obligations to help others. Am I living my life the way I want
to or am I living my life the way others want me to? Am
I wasting my life, or am I making it worthwhile? Are there
times when I am so self-centered I cannot think about the
problems of others or do I always ignore the needs of others?

Questions aroused by Mr. Labro’s speech followed a similar
vein. Am I just contented to accept what others accept
(whether it is good or bad) just because it provides comfort?
Or am I willing to risk some of this comfort to strive for what
I feel is right? I see apathy all around me, but are all of
these people happy or are they bored to death like Frenchmen
before the May uprising? Do I suffer from a sense of useless-
ness or lack of understanding for world problems and other
people? Furthermore, as a student am I getting an education;
am I really learning about life or am I reading about life?

From remarks made by Jack Thomas, I believe that at
W&L I am just reading about life. Living within the Utopian-
like existence at W&L, I seem to have forgotten what life
is all about. It isn’t parties on weekends and classes on week-

days. It is more than that. It must be. Why else would a black |

man stand up in front of a white majority and say he distrusts
all whites? Why does he distrust whites? What have whites
done to warrant this mistrust? What can I do to try to gain
the black man’s trust? Am I a racist? Am I immoral in going

to a school in which the student body is in a position to help

blacks, and even whites, in need, but insists there is no prob-
lem? Since I am in a position to help, why don’t I?

These are not all of the questions I have asked myself.
Even these, however, may never be satisfactorily answered.
The point is that I am thinking and reflecting on myself. I
hope many students have been similarly moved. If this is the
case, then CONTACT can certainly be considered a success.

Independent Exam Schedul

The Friday Ring-tum Phi wishes to go on record as en-
dorsing the Executive Committee’s independent examination
proposal. An editorial on this subject would only repeat the
observations expressed by sophomore EC member Stamen
Ogilvie in a letter appearing on this page. We urge you to
read it.

Lovemaking at W&L?

The curriculum at W&L is now undergoing changes. An
editorial from the February 12 Richmond News Leader dis-
cusses a curriculum change at the University of South Carolina
in Columbia, which aims “at development of the whole per-
son.”

Under USC's new curriculum, students will have their
choice of 101 short courses on lovemaking, premarital sex and
bartending. These courses, involving no entrance fee, no
exams, no grades and no credit, are part of a new program
whereby students select their own courses, and teachers pick
out what they would like to teach

Fortunately courses suc h as these don't need to be taught

at W&L.

(Editor's Note: This is Bill Walk-
er’s final article in his series on
the Honor System's effectiveness.)

By BILL WALKER
First Year Law

The Honor System at Washington
and Lee is more than a set of moral
precepts; it is a legal system. Its
primary function is that of all legal
systems, to enforce compliance with
the rules. In our case, the rules are
neatly, if unrealistically, defined in
three prohibitions against lying, cheat-
ing, and stealing. There is no code,
no definition of offenses, and no
precedent. Likewise, there is no gradu-
ated system of punishment for en-
forcement. This absence of codifica-
tion and graduated punishment de-
prives our system of the essence of
the American legal tradition—justice.

There would be no need for a
code if the system operated as it is
so concisely stated, but it does not.
Although there is a_ prohibition
against lying, it has been judicially
announced that one is not criminally
liable for intentionally and notori-
ously misrepresenting his age to the
ABC personnel. The of
would take issue our
expedient ruling. Likewise, pro-
hibition against cheating quite
flexible enough for the student court
announce that one is not liable

spite the prohibition on the card
against such practice. Even the
prohibition against theft falls short

ternity brother's liquor at a party.

Conflicting Interpretations

The problem obvious. Either
through ambiguity, or executive equi-
vocation, the three prohibitions are
subject to numerous conflicting in-
terpretations. The recent student body
honor trial made this fact quite clear.
S» we have a situation in which a
student’s own good faith interpreta
tion of one of the prohibitions may
by chance differ from that of the
honor court, and the result is con-
viction. | find it hard to believe that
the court possesses unique and
infallible ability to interpret the
ambiguities of the system better than
the ordinary student. I find it
difficult to define justice where one

who acts in good faith and with
honest intentions is convicted of dis-
honor

 

A codification of the honor system
is needed to remove the ambiguity.

a

 

Letters To The Ed

Each of the three basic prohibitions
should be clearly defined, so that
there can be no doubt in an indi-
vidual’s mind as to the limits of the
system. It is only logical where one’s
entire academic career depends on
his adherence to a particular system
that he be furnished with a clear
definition of that system. Justice
should never be allowed to rest on
mere chance.

The Absolute Penalty

It is strange that the one un-
ambiguous tenet of the system as it
presently exist is the greatest travesty
of justice. I refer to the absolute
penalty on determination of guilt.
The absolute penalty is part of the
traditional honor system at Washing-
ton and Lee, and like other aspects
of the system, it has survived the
death of the era and reasoning of
which it was a part. When our honor
system was ordained, about one hun-
drerd ago, the contemporary
concept of criminal punishment was
to remove the criminal from society,
to isolate him permanetnly so that
he might never again break the law.
The modern concept, on the other
hand, is that criminals should be
rehabilitated and reoriented so that
they might become assets to society.
Our absolute penalty totally disregards
this modern concept.

The only logical justification for
the absolute penalty in our system
would seem to be that once a man
commits a breach of honor, he is
forever dishonored, and never again
suitable for our respect. If this
the case, then Washington and
a university of thirteen
dishonorable men who are unfit to
be here. | dare say that there is
not among us one individual who
since reaching maturity has not in
any way compromised his own honor,
at least as honor is defined by our
system. Certainly each of us has at

being the case, is it not gross hypo-

| knows by that stage in the semester
} what courses will require most of
our study time. Of course, if an

 

emergency arises the Dean of Students
can still authorize a change in a man’s
Ischedule at any time. Let me em-
| phasize that this aspect of the pro-

pulsion except for the sanctimonious?
;Do we in any way improve our-
selves, or for that matter the guilty,
by the blind banishment? Certainly,
in some cases it is most just that
the offender be removed from our
midst. But can we honestly say that
this is the best result in every case?
I hardly think so.

In our modern legal system, the
legislature and the courts have de-
fined certain punishments commensu-
rate with various crimes. It is
recognized that some violations are
far less serious than others. | doubt
that there

are many among us,
even on the executive committee, who
would recommend that our courts

of law punish murderers and speeders
in the same manner. Such a course
of action would simply not be logical,
and in no way would it serve justice.
But here we readily accept the prin-
ciple of common punishment for
uncommon violations. For instance,
we punish the senior who copies ver-
batim a passage from a book and
represents it as his own in the same
way that we punish a frightened fresh-
man who panics on his first college
paper and uses the ideas of another
as his own. I can find no justice,
no equity, and certainly no reason
in such action. The seriousness of the
two violations is certainly not equal,
so why should the punishment be the
sume?
Stagnant System

The absolute penalty does injustice
not only to the individual who is con-
victed, but also to those of us who
remain so uprightly behind. Recently,
the Ring-tum Phi published a letter
allegedly written by a_ convicted
violator of the system. The author
claimed that he was a better man
for his conviction and dismissal, But
how will we ever know? Certainly
we would wish that the punishment
we mete out would make him a
better man, but if he never returns,
Wwe can never realize the extent of
success. We deny him the right
to return to our company and prove
that he is repented, and that he
has become a better and more valu-
able person for the experience. And
we ourselves might use one of the
finest potentials in the university be-
cause of one indecretion. So the
system stagnates, and without rein-
forcement it simply compounds the
injustice with each application.

I suggest that we should create

our

 

other modes of punishment, so that

r

  

 

 

posal is not a provision to placate
any faculty member who questions
your or my maturity. Rather it is

a means of self discipline whereby a!

Exam Schedule i"

The Honor System's Dishonor

the dispensation of each individual
case can truly be decided on the
merits. I would suggest that the
Executive Committee be given the

option of imposing one semester or
one year of suspension, after which
time the guilty party, is he so desired,
might return to Lexington to redeem
himself, to be given the opportunity
to prove that he is not now eternally
dishonorable. | think we would find
that we might learn a great deal
more about honor and courage than
we do in our present sanctimonious
little world. We might learn there is
a far more to honor than not getting
caught,

I do not mean to suggest that the
absolute penalty is never justified,
Certainly there are cases which show
such abandonment of honor that the
absolute penalty is only fitting and
proper. But not in every case, in every
set of circumstances which brings
one’s honor into question. I think that
most men deserve a second chance,
and that justice demands that they
be allowed that chance. I can imagine

few violations of the honor code
which are so inherently and _ ir-
revocably wrong that only eternal

exile will protect our university and
we ourselves.
Fear Is Cowardice

There are various arguments made
in favor of the absolute penalty. The
most prominent of these is that the
honor system is too important to
our good name. But is the name of
Washington and Lee worth more than
justice to our fellow man? Others
contend that without the absolute
penalty the honor system would lose
the aura of terror which they assert
make it work. But that which is done
or not done on the basis of fear of
retribution not honor, but rather
cowardice. And still asset is far

Is

outweighed by the deriment. Law
without justice is empty, without
meaning or purpose. One hundred

years of tradition will not justify even
a single act of injustice.

I would imagine that the absolute
penalty will continue to operate
it has for so long. Those who aren't
made to suffer by it just do not seem
to care about the injustice that is
done in their name. Until each of
us replaces indifference with reason
and compassion, and values justice
more than sanctimony, the blindness
of our honor system will continue to

Neer Leads Charge Over Marines

By MIKE HOSFORD

After Tuesday night’s win over
Lynchburg College, the Generals did
not seem to let up a bit against the
Quantico Marines, at least for a
while. Storming out to a 16-0 lead,
the Generals seemed to be the only
team who knew which way the gym

was, The Marines appeared confused
and disorganized until the appearance
of Mike Redd on the court mid-way
through the first half. (Redd was a
Little All-America at Kentucky Wes-
leyan College and a recent draftee of
the Boston Celtics). At that point the
tide of the game seemed to take a

Good Guys Shoot ’Em Up

By MIKE HOSFORD

The rifle team seems to have
finally emerged from the realm of
the unknown and into the spotlight,
or in other words, “they done good,”
The previously unheard of, unherald-
ed group has come up with one of
the winning-est record of any sport
this year. We hear praise of the
basketball team’s 15-4 record, of the
swimming team’s 6-1 record, but who
ever knew the rifle team was riding
high with a 6-1 record?

Trying to compare this record with
any prior to 1965 is difficult because
the athletic department doesn’t even
have records before 1965. (Perhaps
this season will prompt them to keep
better records of the rifle team for
future reference). The growth since
1965 has been slow. The 1965-66 and
1966-67 teams did not win a match.
Last year’s team was still slightly on
the low side with a 3-7 record. This
year’s team is, however, different
in several respects other than it
successful record. First of all, most
of the consistent team shooters are
upperclassmen, which generally has
not been the case before. Second, the
team has a new coach, Sgt. White
of the ROTC department, who seems
to be a valuable asset to the team.
He replaced Sgt. Fields as coach this
year. We could make a few analogies

 

but we won't got that far. It will
suffice to say that the team has
significantly improved to the point
of receiving well deserved recognition
for its accomplishments. As one mem-
ber said, “We've moved out of
YMCA’s and into motels,” which
seems to show that the athletic de-
partment is taking a little greater
interest than in the past. At present
the university supplies guns and
equipment and provides lodging, etc.,
on trips away from school.

Below appears a_ schedule of
matches so far with scores. The
team’s only loss was suffered at the
trigger-happy fingers of a strong
Georgetown team in early December.
Since that time the Generals have
been undefeated, including two wins
last weekend against William and
Mary and the University of Rich-
mond, both of whom W&L had
beaten previously.

turn in the opposite direction as a
27-7 lead dwindled to 35-29 at the
half. In the last eight minutes of the
first half, the Marines outscored the
Generals 22-8. A spectacular 19 point
performances by Mike Redd in the
first half (considering he did not
even start!) seemed to be the dif-
ference. The Quantico defense gelled
towards the end of the half, and an
extremely hard press led to a num-
ber of W&L turnovers resulting in
buckets for the Marines. As a result
the Generals’ lead was cut to 35-29
at the half.

The second half seemed to reconcile
the two extremes of play found in
the first half. With 15 minutes left
the Marines pulled within two points,

45-43. They tied the game for the

first time with 9:40 left, 51-51. From}

there on out it was a see-saw battle,

Perhaps the one thing that saved
the Generals in the waning minutes
was Mike Redd’s fouling out with

tion for his spectacular 29 point per-
formance from the — gentlemanly

Stickmen Launch Early Attack |

Faced with a difficult regular sea- principal goal of the February pro-

son schedule, including the like of
Penn State, Washington College and
U.Va., Washington and Lee’s young
lacrosse team has already begun its
unofficial February practice sessions.
Helped by good weather and by the
use of facilities with which it has
never been provided before, the squad
is attempting to make the most of
the situation. The practices, run by
Coach Dick Szlasa and his assistants
John West and Jim Wynn, are aimed
at the goal of preparing the team
for a series of March scrimmages,
beginning March 8 against the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. Other scrim-
mages include one against Roanoke
March 15, Franklin and Marshall
March 18, and Dartmouth March 26.

Coach Szlasa has been pleased with
the turnout and effort displayed so
far. He encourages all those interest-

ed, even if they have not played
before, to come out now if they
wish to play varsity or “B” squad.

It is Szlasa’s hope that the practices | 7

will help to mature his young team
as rapidly as possible. Therefore the

gram is conditioning, in order that
the scrimmages can be
learning experiences, rather than be-
ing used to get the team in shape.

Despite a strong nucleus of return-
ing lettermen, the prospects of the
team depend to a great extent on
the speed with which some of the
freshmen and untested upperclassmen
develop. The defense, anchored by
goalie Pete Nowick and co-captain
Charley Stewart, is the area in which
competition is greatest. Returning
lettermen Ned Coslett, Tom Mullenix
and Bill Brumback are strong unit
but boys like Frank Stearns and
Bob Radcliffe, up from last year’s
“B” squad, and freshman Tommy
Smith are presenting a strong chal-

We're in the market for restless talent.
Your talent, if you'd enjoy helping us
continue a revolution we started some
years ago: changing the once-conser-
vative banking industry into a leading,
driving social force.

Today, the world of the modern New
York banker is one of innovation and
change. Of new concepts, new methods
and new ideas.

At Chemical Bank, in particular, you'll
find opportunity to make a contribu-
tion. Responsibility. Elbow-room for
rapid growth. Hard work, advancement
and reward commensurate with ability.
Right now, we're looking for young
people who want to live and work in the
New York metropolitan area, where
it’s happening most. Who are commit-
ted, and burn to help make decisions
that change the face of today’s world.
If you'd like to learn more about our
kind of revolution—and how you can
join us—set up an interview. Our men

‘The way

I see it’

(Editor's note: “The way I see it”
is a column of general editorial
comment for which contributions
are solicited from students and
facutly concerning any topic.)

By FRAN LAWRENCE

The most difficult position for the
student to assume, and yet probably
the most beneficial, is that of non-
involvement. By non-involvement I
mean non-commitment to organiza-
tions and organized beliefs which de-
mand judgments on the way things
ought to be in the world or the na-
tion. Such involvements are purported
to be necessary to bring about a
better world, They are directed to-
ward what are proclaimed to be good
and essential ideas. They pretend to
hold the hope for the future. As well,
strong and articulate commitment to
the involvement is supposed to show
strength of character, sensitivity to
the human situation, love for fellow
man, Those involved argue that views
opposed to theirs are at least wrong,
perhaps dangerous, and that those
uncommitted are apathetic, insensi-
tive, or perhaps inhuman.

My contention is that the student
should make a point of non-commit-
ment because of the circumstances
uniquely belonging to him and only
available to him for four short years.
Academic freedom can only be realiz-
ed in the individual student that frees
himself from preconception about the
way things are or ought to be.
Literally, it is being able to be free
in order to learn,

Admittedly, the student will pick
up ideas (for instance, this idea) but
committing himself to the organiza-
tions of the ideas doubles the prob-
lem. Now the student must quit both
the idea and the organization to move
on. Pressures toward standing be-
hind ideas in college seem to be the
tragic extention of a neurotic fear of

WA&L in finals at
Dartmouth meet

Debaters Tim Wright and John
Reynolds set a new school record
last weekend by being the first WAL
team ever to reach the elimination
rounds at the Dartmouth Invitational
Debate Tournament. Seeded 14th out
of the top 100 teams across the
nation, (including such top teams as
MIT, UCLA, and Houston), the
Wright-Reynolds combination finally
lost to Harvard. Except for George
Washington University and Houston,
who finally won the tournament, W&L
was the only school in the Southeast
to reach the eliminations,

In other competition around the
nation, John MeCardell and Bill
Radigan won three of five debates at
Drexel. In Richmond, Kenny Murov
and Doug Adams were chosen the
fourth and fifth best speakers in the
Novice division, while they with team
mates Stacy Eastland and Charles
Smith won six of twelve debates.
Also this weekend, Kevin Baker and
Andrew Wyndham posted a two-six
record at Northwestern.

 

 

  
  
  
    

Senator George McGovern addresses Contact audience in Lee Chapel.

McGovern attacks U. S. foreign policy
in final address for Contact symposium

Sen. George McGovern, D-SD, said
here Saturday “the true lessons of
history are to be found in a sense
of limits, an appreciation of how
greatness has destroyed itself again
and again by reaching for what it
could never obtain.” His speech, “The
Limitations of Power,” was Contact's
final symposium for 1969.

Before a crowd of more than 600
in Lee Chapel, McGovern pointed to
a need for a re-evaluation of policies.
“No where,” he said, “is there more
need for a re-evaluation than in
foriegn policy.”

McGovern used as an example the
war in Vietnam. “The lesson America
must learn from the Vietnam war is
a sense of its own limitations in
world affairs. The United States has
mistakenly viewed the Vietnam con-
flict as one battleground in a titanic
world struggle between democracy
and communism, between the forces
of good and evil. What we have
lacked, in my judgement, is a sense
of history, a sense of perspective
about ourselves and other nations.
Thus, we are contending in our own
minds not with a proud and sensitive
people humiliated by more than a
century of colonialism, but with
bloodless materialists.”

McGovern went on to say this
“seeming blindness to historical per-
spective goes far beyond Southeast
Asia. American idealism, America’s
sense of itself as the world’s last
and best hope, has lead to a blurring
of the lines. We seem to have lost
the capacity to tell where America
leaves off and the rest of the world
begins. We have been told our cause

Managing Editor

é WAL graduate Charlie McDowell, Jr. class of
1948, syndicated humorist-columnist and Washington ©
correspondent for the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Fe-
cently offered some fresh comments on campus dis-

ordets.

Speaking before a seminar, “News As It Is Or isn't”
at Mary Baldwin last week, MeDowell reflected on
student activism from the journalist's perspective. '

McDowell objectively approached the delicate ques-
tion of the media's connection with student rebellion
ws a causal agent, While not rejecting that the media
(especially television) do act as stimuli, McDowell

_ defended the position of the media on the grounds ©
- that TV and newspapers have the task, which they ©
must accomplish, of presenting the news. He explained
that newsmen try to cover such controversial events

as objectively as possible.

However, in many cases, Newsworthy circumstances,
no matter how objective in their presentation, don't
lend themselves to unbiased interpretation. For example,
McDowell pointed out that often in a confrontation
“officials will behave stupidly, and television will cover 5

-
it.

By capitalizing on such broadcasts student leaders
can “provoke the right people,” and then instead of
20 they have 2,000 people to lead, McDowell added

was the cause of all mankind. We
have not distinguished between stand-
ing for our ideals at home and trying
to impose them on others abroad.”

McGovern said he hoped the
United States will “exercise prudence
and cautiousness” in its foreign policy.
“We must beware of intervening in
other peoples internal strife.” If it
becomes necessary, then “let’s take
the request to the U.N.”

When asked about the possibilities

of a volunteer army, McGovern re-

“I favor this system over the
draft.” The problem of the draft
system is that “those men are lost
about the time they become valu-
able.” The volunteer system would
sign men on a 20-30 year career basis,
thus eliminating the problem of turn-
over and the wasted cost of training
men who will be released in two
or three years. The volunteer system
would eliminate most of the unfair-
ness of the present sysiem that
“hangs the threat of the draft over
the heads of all young men when
only a few are called.”

The proposed system would neces-
sitate doubling service pay of en-
listed men making it comparable to
civilian pay scales. “One of the prob-
lems is that we don't have a definitive
study of the proposal yet. However
the President has asked that this be
expedited. With the war hopefully
drawing to a close, now seems to be
a good time to look at a change.”

Asked whether the volunteer sys-
tem would create a class army, Me-
Govern pointed out that “we have
a large career force as far as officers.”

News analysis

By PROF, DELOS D. HUGHES
Political Science

Campus discussion about this year’s
Contact Symposium is as often about
the merits of Contact as a program
as it is about the ideas Contact
speakers left with their audiences.
After five years experience and sev-
eral thousand dollars expense it seems
appropriate to reconsider the pro-
gram fully and publicly. The opinions
of the whole community are relevant
and needed. These reflections are |
offered in that cause.

There is a widespread assumption
that any serious activity initiated by
students—even if radical—is valuable
because it is evidence of the growth
of what a university exists to nour-
ish. This assumption often leads us to
be uncritical about such activity. Even
when speakers are poor, the audience
insensitive or unresponsive, and lec-
tures poorly attended, approval of a
Coniact program is almost automatic
—not because anyone necessarily got
something out of it, but because a
number of people put a great deal
into it.

If this point has merit, some ques-
tions ought to occur, Was anything
gained from Contact other than ad-
ministrative experience for its man-
agers? Is the quality of the Sym-
posium experience a result of the
structure of the program, the talents
of the guests, or the competence of
the audience? Is the benefit worth the
expenditure? Is there an alternative,
more efficicient way to use resources
to the same or greater advantage?

The suggestion in raising these
questions is not that the IFC and
commitiees have answered

it was inaugurated, so it is not obvi-
ous to the public whether such mat-
ters have been recently considered by

EC plans freshman

assimilation program

An unusually uneventful Executive
Committee meeting discussed Mock
Convention debts for last year, As-
similation Committee proposals, and
Staman Ogilvie’s exam scheduling
proposal.

First on last evening’s agenda was
the discussion of uncollected bills of
the Mock Convention. Two students
were questioned about their inability
to gain payment of advertising bills
for the “Journal.” As yet, Frank’s
ESSO, Barn Dinner Theater, and
Churchill Downs have failed to ful-
fill their contracts of last year. Danny
Leonard stated that he will attempt
to get the University to send bills
to these companies, so as to give
more legitimacy and authority to the
requests.

Also concerning the Mock Con-
vention, Ron Kessler stated that at
the present time his organization re-
quired no funds, as debts had been
paid, and no immediate needs for
money existed. He reminded the EC
of the up-coming selection of reg-
ional chairmen and general co-chair-
men for the Convention in 1972.

Bill Gottwald reported upon a pro-
gram formulated by the Assimilation
Committee to aid freshmen in the
selection of their majors. The group
plans to sponsor a meeting this
Spring of freshmen, department heads,
and several upperclassmen to dis-
cuss the various majors. They will
meet in Lee Chapel for three con-
secutive nights, each session devoted
to either the Commerce School, the
College, or to the science and math
departments. President Passavant
noted that the most outstanding
feature of this proposal is that it is
run by students and not faculty; this
will facilitate better understanding by
freshmen of the departments.

The VASG meeting coming up
Thursday, February 20, was discuss-
ed next. Danny Leonard, Joe Tomp-
kins, Rob Turnbull, Rob Bauer, and
Reed Byrum were chosen to repre-
sent W&L at the conference. Passa-
vant then encouraged members of
the Student Civil Liberties Commit-
tee to attend the Hollins Conference
on Student Disorders, which will be
held this weekend.

ODK assembly

The ODK Assembly will begin at
11:50 a.m. on Friday, February 21,
in Doremus Gymnasium. Attendance
is required.

The schedule of classes on Friday
morning will be as follows:

A—8:00-8:40 G—-10:18-10:55

C—B8:45-9:25 1—11:00-11:40

E—9:30-10:10 Assembly —11:50

 

 

Staman Ogilvie then spoke about
his proposed exam schedule. He will
meet tomorrow with the faculty Com-
mittee on Courses and Degrees to
explain his plan in depth to them.
EC members will then be sent to
all faculty members to discuss the
possible scheduling change. The addi-
tion of a reading day was cited as
a further change in the proposal, but
concern was expressed about faculty
sentiment against this. The faculty
Executive Committee stated in its
meeting yesterday afternoon that a
day will be added to the present
number of class days if a reading
day is to be included. The possibility
of the Saturday before Spring vaca-
tion being used as such a day seemed
most favorable to this faculty group.
The EC then voted unanimous sup-
port to Sandler to include a reading
day in the proposed exam plan.

—Reed Byrum

IFC endorses
a reading day

The IFC in its session last night
voted to recommend to the faculty
to retire the Scholarship Cup which
has been held by ZBT for the last
14 semesters. They also endorsed an
EC resolution requesting a reading day
for the Thursday before exams start.

The resolution urging the retirement
of the cup was introduced by Chuck
Cahn and passed by a narrow 8-7
margin. Mark Eaker’s resolution sup-
porting last week’s EC action on a
reading day for this spring passed
unanimously.

Dean Atwood mentioned that there
are three alternatives involved in
eliminating the reading day. First,
elimination of the Thursday's classes;
second adding an extra exam day
Sunday afternoon (if the first day of
exams were eliminated); third, move
Thursady’s classes to the previous
Saturday.

Dean Atwood felt that the first
alternative would be rejected com-
pletely by the faculty as they have
already given up a great deal of their
class hours to accomodate no Satur-
day classes. He then wondered what
the sentiment was among the students
as to the other alternatives. In a poll
of the IFC, they indicated that they
favored a Saturday class over a
Sunday afternoon exam.

Clark Carter also announced that
the IFC Judicial Board is accepting
applications for the chairmanship of
next year’s Contact program. Carter
announced also that Andrew Wynd-
ham had been appointed chairman of
the IFC's upcoming Blood Drive.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion Of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s T'wice-Weekly Newspaper
Tuesday, February 18, 1969

A matter of excellence

Contact was superb. The entire five-day affair was well
planned and executed, enlightening and lively, and—for a
pleasant change—the title was relevant to the discussions and
lectures. Another pleasant change was that the first guests
were as interesting as the top-billed McGovern. Mr. Hinkle,
chairman, deserves a warm expression of appreciation for
using $5,000 to put together an excellent symposium.

 

Presented for your interest

The faculty survey which appears above right is published
more out of a sense of curiosity on our part than for any
other purpose. Surveys of this kind are difficult—if not
dangerous—to interpret as there are so many qualifications in
each man’s mind as he answers ‘yes’ or ‘no’ or ‘no answer.’

We would, nevertheless, venture to say that a short-term
plan for Washington and Lee, in some form, appears to be
favored by a majority of the faculty and not disliked by many;
this is one of the most encouraging aspects of the survey.

Recalcitrance and revision

Last week we pointed out some of the many burdensome
provisions of the Executive Committee’s proposed exam
schedule, which we had hoped would prompt that august
body to reconsider its suggested revisions. Instead, the EC’s
Staman Ogilvie wrote an ill-considered letter to The Friday
Ring-tum Phi in which he tried to justify the format of the
proposed schedule.

We don’t buy his arguments.

No matter how many exams there are in one day or how
many days of the week on which exams may be taken, it
still remains fact that the present schedule contains fourteen
days, the proposed schedule ten days. Why must these four
days be given up? For grading, as in the EC’s proposal?
(Meanwhile, the students get a four-day holiday, which, as
we said last week, we’d rather have for studying.) No, these
four days are useless for grading purposes—if Mr. Ogilvie
had studied the exam systems at other schools, he would have
noted that neither Davidson, Mary Baldwin, nor Hollins ex-
periences a deluge of last-day exams.

And we still don’t understand 1) why the schedule must
be set two weeks beforehand or 2) why so much must be
signed (etc.) in order to take an exam. Sure, a student can
fix his schedule in advance. But why? And Mr. Ogilvie’s
rationalization about the honor system and “clerical errors”
is pure hoopla. Sign a card to receive an exam, sign the same
card when the exam is returned. Big deal. Why do we need
anything more? We don’t.

Our intention here is not, as we tried to point out last
week, to demean either the idea of exam revision or the job
done by Mr. Ogilvie. We feel, however, that in its excite-
ment to obtain the much-needed reform, the Executive Com-
mittee has neglected to provide for a workable, simple alter-

native.

 

Staff editorial

The faculty as a legislature {11}

We were reminded of our thoughts on the faculty as a
legislature during the IFC debate last Monday over allowing
combos to play Friday nights. The channels of power became
painfully clear to all present at that meeting. The faculty
has been delegated complete authority over student life and
any potential change must first be filtered by the Student
Affairs Committee (SAC) and then presented to the entire
faculty.

The effectiveness of this procedure is shown by the various
proposed reforms passed by the IFC several months ago. To-
day, they are still being considered and shelved by the SAC.
There will be even further delay in these measures because
at the direction of the faculty the SAC is considering modifica-
tion of the pareital rules for the freshman class.

We do not, and cannot, deny the faculty its legitimacy
in exercising this authority. It has this power delegated to it
by the Board of Trustees. But we do ask—Is this the most
expedient way? Is this way in the best interest of both the
student body and the University as a whole? We feel the
answer to both these questions is no! Would not Washington
and Lee be a better university if the faculty ordered the
academic life and the students ordered the students’ life?

We definitely feel that the creation of a joint IFC Judicial
Board-Student Control Committee with power to formulate as
well as enforce policy over all facets of student life would
be an invaluable extension of student government and student
responsibility,

A professor should not have to weigh the merits and de-
merits of a Friday night combo party or the hours at which
all girls must be officially out of the fraternities, The faculty
should be here to teach and guide and not to be concerned
with the rules and regulations of student and fraternity life.

—R.W.K.

From the J-School

 

By LAURENCE M, HILLIARD
Columnist

Everybody knows the American
college campuses “where the action
is”"—Berkley, Chicago et al. So last
summer Esquire magazine set out to
discover the campuses where the
action is not. Esquire asked eight
conservative organizations to recom-
mend a list of nice conservative col-
leges. (Freely translated, that means
colleges which have not shown any
forward-looking trends since the Mid-
dle Ages.)

One of the organizations, that self-
righteous defender of American pa-
triotism——the Daughters of the Ameri-
can Revolution, submitted a list of
thirteen colleges—including Washing-
ton and Lee. Thus, according to the
D.A.R., W&L is one of a select 13
of the nation’s 2,000 colleges and uni-
versities which are most noteworthy
for their lack of practically anything
conducive to a modernized collegiate
scene. Boy does that hurt! Even
V.M.L. was not on the list.

Is this a fair evaluaion of W&L?
You bet your life it is! Apathy is
a way of life at all 220 year-old
universities in Lexington, Virginia.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not ad-
vocating that we burn down Wash-
ington Hall, with Deans Pusey and
Atwood inside. Who do you think
I am, Jack Horowitz? But I do feel
that there is a definite need for more
student involvement in all areas.

Who's to blame for W&L’s position
on Esquire’s black list—the students

 

ean SL

or the administration? The answer is
that they're both to blame.

The student body is in no way a
representative cross section of the
American population. Students are
about 99% from upper middle class
or wealthy backgrounds. This wealthy
conservative background is hardly
conducive to the radical and creative
thinking that is daily changing our
world. As far as the W&L stud is
concerned, a major catastrophe is not
being able to find a date for Saturday
night.

The administration claims that it is
attempting to make the enrollment
more representative. But every Sep-
tember, with a few exceptions, we
see the same students arrive for
Freshman Camp—well-groomed hair,
conservatively dressed, 65% from
Southern and Border States. Token
integration does not change the pic-
ture.

And how much power is given to
the students? Very little. We have a
student E.C. and a thousand other
committees. But the faculty has virt-
ual veto power over all of their de-
cisions. Two years ago, the E.C.
presented a referendum asking the
students what speakers they would
like invited to campus to speak under
the U.C.A. program. S.N.C.C. leader
Stokley Carmichael and Mario Savio,
leader of the Berkley Free Speech
movement, were among the top vote
getters. But the administration turned
thumbs down of these two because

 

 

W&L & the DAR go hand in hand

they did not represent religious groups
—in other words, they were too con-
troversial,

Contact is sponsored by the stu-
dents, yet they have absolutely no
say in who will be invited to speak.
Contact would certainly be of greater
interest to the students if they had
at least some say in the selection of
speakers. This year’s speakers were
all experts in their fields, but who can
really get excited over a science critic
and an economist, both unknown to
the majority of the students?

The Executive Committee should
be a force to encourage student
activity. But who can honestly say
he has been spurred to greater things
by the E.C.? Jay Passavant came up
with an excellent idea toward this
goal—the “Bitch-in.” But only four
E.C. members bothered to show up.
If the majority of the E.C. decided
the “Bitch-In” was not worth their
time, how can the students be ex-
pected to show an interest?

The university that refuses to cater
to all but a select portion of the col-
legiate community, the university that
is dictatorial in its administration, will
always be deserving of inclusion
among the campuses where the action
is not. But there is still hope for
WAL. Robert Shelton, Grand Im-
perial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan,
refused to recommend any colleges as
safely conservative because “some lib-
eral instructors and trends” were
found at every campus investigated.
Maybe these trends will be able to
assert themselves—even at W&L.

Contact ‘69 was going to start that
afternoon: the first article of this

series would be in print that evening
by dinnertime: | had good reason to
greet last Tuesday with all the cheer
a senior can muster before noon on
any given day of his last college
semester. If | didn't jump for joy
when the mailman came by deliver-
ing love from a girl at Penn at
least it was a good enough day to
keep me from biting when he hand-
ed me a letter from home that
didn’t contain money for the bills
that also came.

| had my plans laid out for the
week. With my spiral reporter's note-
book and official heavy lead journ-
alist’s pencil | was going to write
history. History is the real job of
a nNewspaperman—why, where, when
and the rest are merely his tools.
Something happens, it is reported, it
wppears in the paper, and the history
of man has another chapter. The real
problem that faces a reporter is
getting at the heart of an event with-
out the luxury of an historian’s time
lag that allows for perspective. But
it wasnt going to be problem for
me because | had my plans laid out
for the week.

Norman Mailer, Jimmy Breslin,
and Pete Hamill are my heroes. They

cover whats happening and write
about it. They give all the facts and
they do more. Each one gets to

the guts of an event, lives the story;
their hearts are one with the heart of
the happening. With a time lag,
official historians will come back to
the 1960's and tell us why the battle
was fought and who it was who won
In the meantime my heroes tell if

there is a battle at all. And they
know because they cover a story
from deeply within: if blood is shed

it is theirs.

Contact speeches were scheduled;
seminars and cocktail parties too, And
| had my plans. | was going to listen

My plan was to join

 

 

every bit of perception | could bring
to bear | was going to feel out the
story of Contact ‘69 and tell what
it was all about. You see, | had my
plans.

I cleared everything before I start-
ed. Got myself invited to all the
“in” events: “I'd like to attend the
cocktail parties,” | said. “You see,
I have this column. Pm a reporter.”
Ali the inside stuff, that is what I
wanted. | had to get close enough to
really make Contact *69.

Things were going quite well for
a while. Tuesday and Wednesday
went by without a hitch. Jack Thomas
and Ralph Lapp were here. “While
society is racist.” “Our scientific
community must stand up to the
dictates of the business and military
establishment.” They both described
a need for individual moral consci-
ousness. Walter Adams was schedul-
ed to appear next.

I] met Adams for the first time at
Dean Atwood's home—the scene of
the Contact cocktail parties and re-
ception—on Wednesday evening. He
smoked cigars, told funny stories,
and had a very independent air about
him: I quickly became a fan of his.
lt was on Thursday that Adams de-
livered his prepared speech and took
part in a seminar. By that time he
had totally disarmed me. When his
talk in Lee chapel drew to a close
| hopped out of my pew to do a
litte hero worshipping: “Mr. Adams,
you and Lapp have got to cut it
out, knocking the industrial-military-
scientific establishment like this, You

Wandering thru a week of Contact

Later that evening, most of the
guests had left the Atwoods’. Adams
and I were seated in a corner of
the living room. He was honest with
me and | with him: how an economist
and over-thirty individual concerned
with the questions that precocious
America is raising for all; how an
emotionally involved young man de-
velops a living philosophy that is
the proper mix between humanitarian
(Sorry, Dr, Futch) and personal con-
siderations, Ii wasn't a debate; no
contest of competing ideas. Just two
guys talking straight; a meal to feed
their sense of humanity.

My plans were working. | was
really getting the meat of what Con-
tact was about—the story behind the
story. Norman, Jimmy, Pete; | was
on my way.

But then came the crush. Friday
afternoon, Dr, Silber was speaking in
the J-School library. | was there
continuing to suck up all the facts
and color available. My next article
was growing rapidiy, Fach day was
adding to the clarity of my percep-
tion and understanding of Contact
I was going to know whal it was
ali about, | was going big time.
And then | raised my hand to
ask Dr. Silber a question. That was
the start of my fall. That afternoon
and again that evening at his speech,
Silber and | lashed out at each other
“You're not answering the question.”
“You are generalizing.” “I disagree.”

ing to me, | had become part of the
story. It wasn't in the plans, | was

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

Although this section of your
paper is generally used for complaints
and criticism, I would like to use it
for another purpose. It is very easy
to criticize another student for a job
poorly done, but we seldom see one
student congratulate another for a job
well done. Thus, I thank and con-
gratulate Sam Hinkle and his com-
mittee for an outstanding job in
presenting Contact 1969,

Seminars cover
numerous topics

Dr, Duvall gives a lecture entitled
“Observations on the Southern Ro-
mance;” Dr. Kimbrough speaks on
“Current Fertility Trends in America.”
Such events as these are not unusual
in themselves, but they do seem
strange when you consider that they
were topics presented in chemistry
seminars last year at Washington and
Lee.

Working on the premise that chem-
istry seminars can be both useful and
fun, Drs. James K. Shillington and
William J. Watt of the chemistry de-
partment have developed a program
which meets these two goals. Most
of the topics discussed in the seminars
pertain in some way to chemistry. In
order to provide students and guests
with a broad background of knowl-
edge, however, professors from the
different departments of the University
are invited to speak on subjects that
are not related to chemistry in any
way.

Besides providing a means of dis-
cussing ideas about chemistry and
other topics, the seminars also serve
as a means of educating students on
the proper manner of delivering
speeches before groups. The speaker,
whether he is Dr. Hodges speaking
on “Science and God” or Dr. Whitney
lecturing on “Boranes and Cubanes,”
provides an example of how to con-
duct a seminar. The lecurers’ hope is
that the students will learn from them
and be better able to present their
own seminars,

The chemistry seminar program
was begun in the spring of 1954 by
Dr. Shillington and was at first simply
a chemistry discussion group. Dr.
Watt later became involved with the
seminars after he came to WAL.

The usual format of the seminar
program calls for twenty-six to
twenty-nine each year. All seminars
are Open to anyone wishing to attend.

The directors of the program try to
schedule as lecturers four faculty

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Wrestlers beaten by ODC

Last Saturday, the Generals were*
defeated by the Old Dominion Mon-
archs. The grapplers were beaten in
Norfolk to the tune of 33-13.

With four exceptions, the Generals
were stuck in every class. Buzz White,
Razz Rasberry, Wes Pullman, Bill
West, Clarke Carter, and Dave Hig-
gins were all pinned. Jay Thiemeyer
lost by decision.

The picture brightened in the
heavier classes, but it was to late. Dan
Webster and Dee Copenhaver pinned
their opponents; and Jay Clarke won
by decision.

Tuesday, Doremus Gymnasium will
be the scene of a Wahoo-General
contest. Although Virginia boasts a
good team this year, reports indicate
that they will not provide the type of
competition which has outclassed
WAL earlier in the season,

The Generals will be at Sewanee
Friday for this year’s College Athletic
Conference tournament. Last year,
the grapplers finished second in the
tournament; but Coach Miller be-
lieves that, with a win over Sewanee,
the Generals would come out on top.
Thus, a clean sweep of the C.A.C,
after a winless season is a definite
possibility.

A detailed analysis of the season
so far plus Coach Miller’s view on
C.A.C. meet can be found in John
Robinson’s column on this page. *

 

   

 

 

Sports in General ...

 

By JOHN ROBINSON

Last year, Washington and Lee’s
wrestling team had to settle for sec-
ond place in the C.A.C. tournament,
just ten points behind Sewanee. Ac-
cording to Coach Miller, the Gen-
erals hope to turn the tables on
Sewanee on February 21 and 22.

That might sound a little too
optimistic for a team that has posted
a losing record to date. But when you
consider W&L’s competition through-
out the season, you can understand
the problems our squad has faced,
What other team at this university can
boast opponents like North Carolina,
Loyola, N.C. State, and the Uni-
versity of Virginia on its schedule?
Coach Miller summarized the opposi-
tion by saying, “They're all tough
for us this year,”

Several of the wrestlers have post-
ed outstanding individual records.
Coach Miller called Danny Webster
“the outstanding performer with a 7-1
record.” Miller also called Clark
Carter the most improved, despite the

fact that he had drawn some of the
toughest opposition all season.

Team Captain Clark
Team captain Jay Clarke has been
wrestling in the unlimited class all

in a lower weight bracket. Jay has
a 3-3 record even against wrestlers
weighing up to two hundred and
sixty pounds. Dee Copenhaver also
has a winning record of 2-1. Bill
West, Jimmy Hooker, Buzz White,
and Wes Pullman are younger team
members who have also shown a
great deal of promise.

Why, however, do the Generals
stand such a good chance in the
C.A.C. tournament? First of all,
Washington and Lee has faced much

members of the College Athletic
Conference. The team to beat, ac-
cording to Coach Miller, is Sewanee.
Fortunately, the Generals have four
defending C.A.C. champions return-
ing: Razz Rasberry, Jay Clarke, Danny
Webster, and Jay Thiemeyer. The
real test for the wrestling team is,
after all, the conference tournament;
this is the one that really counts and
WAL’s men have a great deal of
confidence.

To sum up the season so far, Coach
Miller told this reporter: “The record
isn’t very invpressive, but all the boys
have done an excellent job this sea-
son.”

night's match,

Natators lose

Over the last weekend, the Gen-,
eral’s swimming team lost a closely
fought meet with West Virginia Uni- |
versity 61-43, while winning a meet
against West Virginia Wesleyan 66-
38 and winning an unofficial meet
against Penn State 76-24.

Against West Virginia University,
the natators put up a strong fight
which saw many outstanding  indi-
vidual performances, The Generals
managed to win the opening 400 yard
medley relay with the team of Billy
Ball (backstroke), John Lawlor
(breastroke), Bim Clark (butterfly),
and Bill Brumback (freestyle) with a
winning time of 3:53.0 which was a
new CAC conference record, a W&L
school record, and a WVU pool
record. Lawlor, after a quick re-
covery from the relay, then managed
to capture a second in the 1000 yard
freestyle falling three seconds behind
the WVU swimmer. Lawlor gained
sweet revenge as he defeated the WVU
swimmer in the 500 yard freestyle
passing him in the last two lengths

to WVa, win

After the relay the West Virginia
swimmers shut out W&L from the
first place slot for the next six events,
Hal Catlin captured a second in the
200 yard freestyle; Ross Forman a
second in the 50 yard freestyle being
touched out by .4 seconds; Ball gained
a second in the 200 yard individual
medley.

The General's finally roused, turn-
ed on the steam and won the 100
yard freestyle, the 200 yard back-
stroke, and the 500 yard freestyle,
but it was too late and with a Moun-
taineer win in the 200 yard breast-
stroke they had the meet cinched,
Brumback won the 100 yard free-
style with a time of 50.4 seconds,
Ball won the 200 back with a time
of 2:15.1 after being challenged three
quarters of the way by a West
Virginia swimmer.

Friday afternoon, against West
Virginia Wesleyan, Coach Stearns ex-
perimented with many changes from
his usual line-up to see how he might
best deploy the team in the CAC

 

of the race.

Generals defeat Davis-Elkins

Saturday W&L traveled to Davis-
Elkins College and returned with its
17th victory of the season. The score
was 76-67 as the Generals disappoint-
ed the homecoming crowd at Davis-
Elkins.

The game was neither impressive
nor disappointing for our Generals.
Washington and Lee felt confident
they could take the game, and did
so. Mel Cartwright led the scoring
with 26 with Mike Neer close behind
with 24 points.

Davis-Elkins came out hot in the
first half and gained an early lead.
But Charlie Stone, who ended up
with 15 points, was just as hot. His
shooting enabled the Generals to gain
and retain the lead. Davis-Elkins used
a zone defense throughout the first
period, primarily in an attempt to
gain a rebounding advantage.

A man-to-man defense was thrown
against W&L in the second half. So
Mel Cartwright moved under the
basket, to team up with Neer, who
had been plagued with a sagging de-

 

two others while away

vard medley relay team of Roger
Martin, Rick Sands, Hal Catlin, and
Ross Forman cruised to an easy vic-

Lawlor, a distance freestyle and
breastroke specialist, and Ball, a back-
stroke and individual medley man,
captured second and third respectively
in the 200 yard freestyle. Bill Brum-
back and Roger Martin then went
1-2 in the S50 yard freestyle. John
Lawlor, again showing off his versa-
tility captured a first in the 200 yard
butterfly, supported by Bert Meem
who gained second, Brumback and
Forman, in their usual positions,
gained a first and second in the 100
yard freestyle while Ball and Catlin
went 1-2 in the 200 yard backstroke.

that this is frequently the situation.
Many students are dissatisfied —“very
many, and don't kid yourself”—some
are disillusioned and few are actually
destructive.

But with the proper oratory plus
good news coverage, this table of
ranks is easily altered, even if only
for a short time.

To defend this point McDowell re-
ferred to the march on the Pentagon
last spring. This affair received “10,-
000 miles of coverage” in words and
on tape from Walter Cronkite to
Harper's, Atlantic, and Norman
Mailer. The humor of the situation
was that the affair was not at all as
severe as it seemed,

The only times trouble threatened
were when the camera lights would
turn on, when the innocent flick of
a switch served to turn the crowds
on and off as quick as the lights.
Finally, McDowell posed the obvious
question by asking whether a severe
quick riot at Bridgewater (or, WAL
for that matier) could possibly equal
in effect the small knot of students
sitting in the street outside the
Pentagon, if a TV camera was not
immediately available.

not being prepared. The home pushes
its children from grade school to
high school to college, fearful that
they may not be ready at some step.
In college, we feel the pressure to
commit ourselves to preparing for
life through various organizations.
But college offers four years in which
we must break the push if we are
ever able to, The treat to education
lies less in the institution than in this
pressure to stand behind beliefs which
are veritable shields against educa-
tion.

Students seeking receptivity instead
of beliefs in college will be far ahead
in their chances of eventually having
viable and valuable beliefs after col-
lege. Student activism is preverted
towards committed ends when activ-
ism should be directed toward find-
ing ends, The organizations tearing
down or lending support to the
Organization are equally neurotic
when students are pushed into them.

A final note: The attendance of
Friday evening and Saturday morning
shows that students may well be will-
ing to continue their education
through the weekend, even if class-
room doors have been barred against
them. Perhaps Contact has already
encouraged the idea that a lecture

Friday or Saturday evening with one’s
date—that education can and does
continue beyond five class days and
beyond classrooms.

Moger Made
Chairman
Of History

Dr. Allen W. Moger will become
head of W&L’s Department of His-
tory for the 1969-70 academic year
and will be succeeded by Dr. William
A. Jenks in September, 1970, was
announced by Dr. William) W. Pusey
Ill, Dean of the College.

Dr. Moger, a member of the uni-
versity’s history faculty for 39 years,
will succeed Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw,
who has been department head since
1962 and a teacher at Washington
and Lee for 42 years.

University policy requires depart-
ment head retirement at age 65, al-
though such professors may continue
to teach until age 70.

Dr. Crenshaw becomes 65 in May,
1969, and Dr. Moger will reach 65
in May, 1970, Both are expected to
continue to teach under the chair-
manship of Dr. Jenks, 51, an alumnus
of Washington and Lee who joined
its faculty in 1946,

Dr. Moger is currently acting head
of the department during a semester's
leave of absence by Dr. Crenshaw.
Dr. Jenks is expected to be on leave
one semester next year. Both leaves
are made possible through a special
grant form the Ford Foundation
designed to strengthen undergraduate
instruction in the humanities.

All three men are active historians
as well as teachers. Dr. Moger’s
highly-praised “Virginia: Bourbonism
to Byrd, 1870-1925" was published
by the University of Virginia Press

in December last year. Dr. Cren-
shaw’s history of Washington and
Lee from 1749 to 1930, entitled

“General Lee’s College,” will be pub-
lished by Random House in May. Dr.
jenks has written widely on Austrian
history, including “Vienna and the
Young Hitler,” published by Colum-
bia University Press in 1960, and
“Austria Under the Iron Ring, 1879-
1893,” published in 1965 by the Uni-
versity of Virginia Press.

Dr. Moger is a native of Nanse-
mond County, Va., and received his
B.A. degree from Randolph-Macon
College in 1927. He earned M.A. and
Ph.D. degrees at Columbia Univers-

ity in 1935 and 1940, He was pro-
moted to professor of history here
in 1951

Dr. Moger is chairman of the Unt-
versity’s Library Committee and its
Lecture Committee.

Dr. Jenks is a native of Jackson-
ville, Fla.. and graduated from Wash
ingion and Lee in 1939. He
earned graduate degrees at ¢ olumbia,
receiving his M.S. in 1940 and the
Ph.D. in 1949, He was promoted to

The editor of the Southern Col-

ing the quarterly magazine to fold,
at least for this year,

Kessler stated that only 150 sub

to more than twice that many fast

that “last year’s Collegian was in debt

Not A Hollow Change

If one set out to prophesy what the major
issue on this campus would be for the next
few weeks, he wouldn’t need a crystal ball.
An educated guess about the soon to be re-
leased Curriculum Committee’s proposal
would be sufficient. Mindful of the debates
that will inevitably ensue, we felt it timely
to evaluate educational philosophy, student
opinion, and the significance of the probable
direction of these proposals on the future of
our curriculum,

The great end of life

is not knowledge

but action.

—Thomas Henry Huxley,
Technical Education

Before we launch into a discussion of the
effect of the Committee’s probable objectives,
a re-assessment of our educational goals must
be taken. W&L must decide what it is at-
tempting to accomplish by enrolling students
for four years of higher learning. Is the Uni-
versity trying to fill students’ heads with
important facts, or is its intention to develop
the active minds of students? The latter goal
seems to be the more important to us. Anyone
can obtain facts by the mere reading of a text-
book but being able to work with facts re-
quires more than that. It requires an instructor
who places a demand on the student to relate
one idea to another in order to answer some
general question posed by the teacher.

At present, students here see little relevance
between the courses they take and society as
a whole. Our poll below satisfactorily indicates
that. If students see little relevance between
the knowledge that they are gaining and the
world about them, then our educational
philosophy must be at fault in some way.
We feel the fault lies with our present learn-
ing process, which is murky at best. Roughly,
the system works as follows: (1) students
obtain facts from different fields their first
two years; (2) when they embark upon their
major, they gain more detailed knowledge
about their particular field of interest; and
(3) they begin to relate their expanse of
knowledge to disciplinary questions their
senior year, primarily through seminar
courses.

We feel that under this system the student
loses interest in the course he is taking and
therefore retains little. The utopian program
of learning for a student who comes to W&L
should force the student to gain knowledge
for himself by presenting him with questions
and the tools with which to answer them. By
questioning him, giving him the tools to go
about finding the answers, the knowledge he
will gain from participating in his courses
will be valuable to him because he arrived at
the answers himself.

Certainly, the present process as described
above does not hold true in all cases; our
alternative may not be practical in all depart-
ments either. But, we think the latter system
wil be conducive to student involvement in
the classroom, and, hopefully, it will en-
courage more students to become involved in
the university community as well. Knowledge
without an active mind that creates with it is
worthless.

Many a dangerous temptation
comes to us in fine gay colours
that are but skin deep.
Mathew Henry,
Commentaries, Genesis, II

At this point, we jump from a philosophic
plane to a more realistic level—the issue of

curriculum change. In the poll taken last
Wednesday, a majority of the students indi-
cated that they favored some form of short
term curriculum. So do we. But we are hesitant
to interpret what their various reasons for pre-
ferring a short term are. If they favored the
two 12 week periods in the hope that their
work would be lightened, they may be badly
misled, for the work load for two 12 week
periods would almost definitely be greater.
If they voted “Yes” because they liked the
idea of a six week holiday, they would prob-
ably be disillusioned should the new system
ever be instituted. It would be encouraging
if the majority of them voted for the plan so
that they would have a six week period to
study independently an area of their own
interest. But, here again, we can only con-
jecture.

Whatever their reasons, it is fairly apparent
that students and faculty members (as shown
by the poll taken by the Tuesday Ring-tum
Phi) are in favor of the plan. We must be
careful, though, not to substitute form for
substance. The 12-6-12 plan is conducive to
the type of learning process we presented at
the opening of this editorial, for it could be
designed for a course group from which the
student can choose a topic to pursue during
his six week study period. The last 12 weeks
could be used to study different questions
undertaken by various students in a course
group. To set up a curriculum such as this
would take study by all the various depart-
ments in the college. Unfortunately, we fear
that many departments may shy away from
this approach, reverting to old curriculum
requirements compacted into two 12 week

 

A New Educational Experience

If dissatisfaction concerning a university’s
curriculum arises within the student body of
that university, what can be done to change
the situation? At the same time, what can
students do to shake traditional thinking about
university education and make learning a new
educational experience?

These questions are currently being answer-
ed by many colleges and universities across
the nation. The students of these schools,
with the aid of faculty, are setting up experi-
mental colleges in an effort to combat the
frustrations they encounter when they try to
gain reforms for curriculums. The primary
aims of the Experimental College are to act
as a model of reform, to prove to the uni-
versity that something can be done to perk up
the monotony of the lecture system and to
involve the talents of the community’s non-
academic people in the curriculums.

The University of Virginia and the Uni-
versity of North Carolina are two of the
schools in this area which have established
such a program on their campuses. The cata-
logue of the Experimental College at U.N.C.
states, “In many ways the Experimental Col-
lege represents the belief that education
experience is like a huge banquet table cov-
ered with a potpourri of foods, and it is the
student’s privilege to select what he wants
and leave the rest.”

The courses offered at U.N.C. and U.Va.
are open to anyone and are taught as seminars
from six to eight weeks, or as long as partici-
pants desire. There is no formal credit and
no grades are given. However, at U.N.C. it
is possible for certain students to enroll in
these courses on a pass-fail basis or to take

shells. If this approach is taken, then we feel them for honors credit in an “Individual
that a large part of the advantages of a 12- Interdisciplinary Study Program.”

6-12 curriculum will be lost.

well, 12-12-6 seems geared toward more of
the same sort of learning process, except for
its six weeks of independent study which could
conceivably turn into an extended term paper
exercise.

Manners with fortunes, humors turn
with climes,
Tenets with books, and principles
with times.
—Alexander Pope,
Moral Essays, Epistle I, Line 172

In the weeks to follow, we will watch for
the publication and fate of the Curriculum
Committee’s proposals with interest. The time
for a change in curriculum is definitely upon
us, but it is not so urgent that decisions for
or against a specific proposal be made quickly
out of predjudice or passion. If all of us are
in agreement that some form of change
should be made, a re-assessment of our educa-
tional goals should first be made in order
that the final decisions on each issue are ob-
jective and sound ones.

Change does not necessarily mean progress.
With a careful re-appraisal of our goals,
a candid study of the issues, and a sensitive
awareness towards faculty and student opin-
ion, the final decisions should not only mean
change, but also progress towards a more
meaningful educational environment. We
cannot afford a hollow change. —L.L.Me.

Students Respond to Poll

By JEFF SPENCE

The voice of WAL is now finally being heard. On
Wednesday this paper polled the student body with re-
spect of their feelings about curriculum in the school,
We would like to thank fellow students for disclaiming
the charge that we are apathetic.

The purpose behind the curriculum poll was to un-
cover the thoughts of the student body, an opinion that
is often neglected at WAL. It is our hope that the poll
might offer to the faculty a responsible estimation of
the curriculum that each student is subjected to and the
students’ viewpoint on new proposals for our future,

According to the figures compiled, we are able to
draw some basic conclusions, WAL students stand in
favor of a short-term program of study. The further
desire to have the short-term on the 12-6-12 plan which
places the independent study period between the first
and second semester, The majority of students taking
the poll believe that the short-term in question should
be graded on the basis of pass-fall,

jects followed by the experimental college at
U.Va. A Theater Games course “involves a
form of sensitivity training. It emphasizes
perception and communication;’”’ Human
Encounters is a course in which students visit
mental hospitals and relate their lives to those
of institutionalized mental patients and a
course in black history teaches a predomi-
nantly white student body about the American
Negro. (It has had to turn away many in-
terested students because of inadequate facili-
ties.)

The courses at U.N.C. are also intriguing.
They include Marxist-Christian Dialogue (dis-
cussions on man’s initiative and responsibility
in history) ; India and Its Culture; a study of
Marshall McLuhan; Electronic Music, Its
Literature and Techniques; Introduction to
Ham Radio; The Role of the Business Pro-
fessional in the Small Town Life; Why Are
We in Vietnam? and Let It All Hang Out
(for all “uninhibited people” to do ‘what
their hearts desire’’).

Thus, one can see these courses from the
conventional to the unconvential. Every de-
partment in the university or any whims of
individuals can be represented in this experi-
mental curriculum. The success of these pro-
grams (over 700 participate at U.Va.) has
done much to make educational reform live
issues of these campuses.

If learning has taken on new and interest-
ing forms at other schools, why can’t the same
thing happen at W&L? It can, if students will

e an active hand in instituting such a pro-
gram. It is only through the students that
this experiment in education can work.

All students here should talk about the
experimental college with faculty members
(many of whom have already expressed in-
terest in this but have doubts about student
participation in it) and suggest courses which
ought to be offered as part of the curriculum.
If the students gain the faculty’s support, then
the experimental university can serve as a
focal point to bring students and faculty to-
gether to fight for curriculum reforms. Even
if faculty support is not strong, students and
towns people can teach experimental courses
themselves, as they do at U.N.C., for they
— talents which university professors

It should also be pointed out that our free
Saturdays would provide opportune times for
these courses to meet. At the same time,
Saturday sessions would allow girls from sur-
rounding schools and interested people around
the city to participate.

We should begin to set this program up
now because major changes in the curriculum
are far from being accepted. Even if the
present curriculum is modified, we have no
guarantee that the curriculum’s substance,
i.e., the number and distribution of courses
from which we must choose, will be changed.

The experimental university may eventually
cause courses to be added to the curriculum,
as it has at other campuses; but, even if it
doesn’t, it will help interested and stimulated
students at W&L fill an intellectual void not
now filled by the university.

SOBLU

By RON KESSLER
Executive Editor

The Joint Committee for Control
of Lexington High School agreed last
night (Thursday) to support six de-
mands of The Local Student Organi-
zation for Black Unity (SOBU),

The demands agreed upon are:

1. The appointment of a commit-
tee to study the current social studies,
art, music, and literature curricula
for the purpose of revising such cur-
ricula to include an adequate pre-
sentation of the Black man’s role in
these fields.

2. The committee for the study of
current courses will be appointed by
the Joint Committee for Control, and
will include representatives selected
fom nominees of the Student Organi-
zation for Black Unity (SOBU) in-
cluding one non-voting student-mem-
ber of SOBU.

3. It is understood that initial
curriculum changes in current courses
in social studies, art, music, and lit-
erature, with respect to Black culture,
would be ready for inclusion in the
1969-1970 school year.

4. Appoint a committee to plan a
Black Culture elective course for sub-
mission to the Joint Committee for
Control.

5. The committee for planning the
Black Culture course will be ap-
pointed by the Joint Committee for
Control, and will include representa-
tives selected from nominees of

 

Demands Met

SOBU including one non-voting stu-
dent-member of SOBU.

6. Should the committee for the
planning of a Black Culture course
arrive at a conclusion satisfactory to
the Joint Committee and the State
Board of Education in time for the
1969-1970 school year, it is under-
stood that said course will be includ-
ed in the curriculum that year,
Should the 1969-1970 deadline not
be met, it is also understood that
further action will be taken to insti-
tute the Black Culture courses in
1970-1971,

A list of demands were first pre-
sented on Monday to Lexington High
Schol principal Frank Thompson. This
first list asked for integration of

Liberals Form

Ihe Progressive Student Alliance, a
newly-formed campus liberal group,
will hold its second meeting Monday
night at 9:00 in the basement of the
McCormick Library.

About 30 students, mostly fresh-
men, met last night to form the
group. Organizer Ron Abrams ex-
plained, “We want to change the
image of the school and get us off

the DAR’s list of the country’s most
conservative colleges.”

 

| Letters To The Editor . . |

 

End Phys. Ed.

To the Editor:

At W&L the only assumption which
is made concerning the character of
a student is that he is a gentleman.
In the traditional definition a “gentle-
man” is one who does not lie, cheat,
or steal, but the connotation of the
term suggests an intelligent and re-
sponsible individual, both capable and
willing to express an opinion in an
orderly, respectful manner. The stu-
dent body tries to maintain this stand-
ard behavior (we haven't burned any
buildings lately and don’t intend to
do so in the foreseeable future).

But gentlemanly behavior should
not be construed to mean that every-
thing on the WAL campus meets with
the approval of the student body.
Rather, it means that the members
of the W&L student body as a whole
enjoy being treated as gentlemen and
that they are willing to act as gentle-
men in order to be so treated.

Why is it, then, that for two years
we are reduced to the status of
forced laborers in a foul smelling
gymnasium? If the assumption is that
a sound mind and a sound body go
together, I ask you to locate a
mind among our “sound-body” people
in the gym. If theintent is to introduce
us to “adult” sports which we would
not otherwise master and enjoy, then
several flaws apepar in the present
system.

First, given mandatory attendance,
people of various athletic interests
(ranging from none to moderate) are
placed in the same class. Thus, any-

one who may want to learn a sport
of skill will not receive the individual
attention necessary in perfecting that
particular sport or skill, Thus indi-
viduals who have learned to play a
sport have usually done so on their
own without help from the P.E. de-
partment. And observe the method of
instruction currently in practice at
Doremus Gym—two weeks of jump-
ing rope and the punching bags, and |
a couple of periods in the handball |
courts.

Not enough time is spent on the
“sports” taught to be of any value.
And the sports which are taught are
generally of two varieties: first, those
that are completely useless, (i.c.,
soccer and tumbling), and, second,
those sports which one can easily
pick up oneself if one has the interest
(i.c., bowling and golf). Also, what
effect does P.E. have upon a student
in his academic work? No one enjoys
carrying a mandatory sixth course;
least of all if the course is scheduled
such that the student has to run
across campus (soaking wet from a
shower, tying his tie en route) in a
desperate attempt not to be late
for another class.

If you of the faculty really believe
that we in the student body are
gentlemen, then please show us that
you so believe by getting rid of the
physical education requirement. The
student body, as a whole, acts in the
mature, orderly fashion that denotes
a gentleman, and I, in this writing,
am attempting to do so.

Please respond to us as gentlemen.

Victory Over Emory and Henry
Gives W&L Small College Title

Washington and Lee clinched the
Virginia State Small College basket-
ball championship Tuesday night by
defeating Emory and Henry 68-63 in
overtime at Emory and Henry.

The game was a see-saw battle all

the way. Emory and Henry led by
as many as seven in the first half
before W&L could come back to

take a 33-29 halftime lead.

Emory and Henry slowed the Gen-
erals’ attack down in the second half
and regained the lead. The Wasps
were ahead by nine points with 7:41
left in the game. W&L then switched

to a tight press and came within five
points of Emory and Henry. Then
the Wasps went into a freeze, but

lost momentum as WAL stole the ball
twice and tied the game up on a
basket by Charlie Stone. During the
last 7.41 the Generals outscored the
Wasps by 11-2, which was enough
to send the game into overtime.
WAL came into the overtime period
with a freeze to get Emory and Henry
out of its 1-3-1 zone. W&L controlled
the ball for two minutes before Mel
Cartwright field goal on a

easily controlled the situation in a

rebounded a missed Wasp shot, fed |
to Cartwright, who gave Neer a re- |

when, with 1:40 left, Cartwright miss- |

The Baby Generals, staying loose
all the way, took a commanding 49-

Major factors in the jayvee’s first
half surge were Mike Truta’s 16
points and strong offensive rebound
ing, John Glace’s hot shooting, and
reserve Jim (Birdnest) Siege’s nine
points

Stege provided the highlight of the
second half as he became the sixth
jayvee to reach the 100 point mark
for the season. Stege finished with
20 points and 15 rebounds for the
game. Bo Brookby fell five short of
making it seven century scorers with

Memphis—Centre College won a
54-52 decision over Sewanee Thurs-
day night. This means that Wash-
ington and Lee will meet Centre
tonight at 8 p.m. (EST), in the
second round of the College Ath-
letic Conference basketball tourna-

past

ment,
The Centre-Sewanee game saw
the lead switch hands 21 times,

The game was tied seven times,
The largest lead Centre could amass
was during the first half when the
Prayin’ Colonels led by five points
at one time. The score at the half
was Centre, 29-26, over Sewanee.

David Blake was the high scorer
for Centre with 17 points. He was
closely followed by Buddy Baker
with 14 points and Mike Cochran

with 12. Bob Knight scored 19
points for the losing Tigers of
Sewanee. He was followed by
Frank Stainback and Wayland

Long, who had 10 points apiece.
According to the Memphis Com-
merical-Appeal, the city’s morning
newspaper, Southwestern is the
favored team in the tournament,
The paper bases this on the team’s
record and its home court ad-
vantage. Of Southwestern’s 19 vic-
tories, two each came against the
University of Tennessee at Martin,
Georgia State and Sewanee. The
Memphis school split two games
with Union College (Tenn.), a team

Leslie has taken ad-

weather, good turnouts and high
spirits to get a good look at some
old faces and a few new ones.

Except for a few veterans being
plagued by several laboratories in
the afternoons, most of last year's

returnees have been out for spring
ball. The reenforcement provided by
some promising freshmen who did
not play last fall has boosted the size
of the squad. The ideal conditions of
the autumn-like February days have
also contributed to the large numbers

Teams Defend Titles

Three Washington and Lee athletic
teams are competing this weekend
for the College Athletic Conference
championships in their respective
sports.

The W&L basketball team will take
a 18-4 record to Southwestern Uni-
versity (Memphis) to defend its CAC
title and fight for its third straight
championship, The Generals open to-
night at 7 o’clock against Centre Col-
lege.

If W&L wins tonight, the Generals
will meet the winner of the Wash-
ington University-Southwestern game.
If the Generals should lose, they
will meet the loser of the Washington
University-Southwestern game. All
W&L games will be broadcast on
WLUR-FM.

The Generals, as the Virginia State
Small College champions, will face

stiff competition in the much im-
proved CAC. The team to watch
this year will be host team South

western, which has met W&L in the
finals for the last two years. The
Lynx go into the tournament with a
19-3 record. This, plus the home
court advantage the team enjoys, will
make it a formidable opponent.

Centre College of Danville, Ky.,
goes into the tournament with an
11-10 record. This is a comeback
for the Prayin’ Colonels who began
the season at 2-8. Sewanee should
not pose too much of a problem for
any team, as it enters competion with
1 3-14 record.

Swimming Championships

Washington and Lee's swimmers
are taking an 8-2 record to Sewanee
for the CAC swimming champion-
ship which began to day. The only
team which should give W&L any
trouble is a much improved team
from the host school.

WAL, as state swimming champ-
ions, are weak in the breaststroke,

“The way

I see it’

(Editor's note: “The way I see it”
is a column of general editorial
comment for which contributions
are solicited from students and
facutly concerning any topic.)

By KIRK WOODWARD
Fran Lawrence wrote a good article
in this space lasi week about the
isolation from the “world” that this

school seems to impose on us.
Many of us who feel the way
Fran Lawrence does, feel especially
guilty about the situation because we
suspect we haven't done all the things

 

we ourselves could to correct the
school’s shortcomings.
Talking about “the world” dis-

courages a person from looking at
his immediate situation. Probably we
can't do anything to improve “the
world,” but most of us walk or drive
to school through a “world” that
offers much of the material needed to
give college education direction and
purpose.

That “world” is the Lexington com-
munity, and most of us ignore if
entirely or laugh at it. But no one
at WAL has a right to feel patroniz-
ine about Lexington. The people of
the non-university sections of town
live with daily awareness and practi-
cal knowledge of issues about which
we are for all practical purposes
ignorant and backward.

The Lexington community offers us
the chance to see and possibly in-

are becoming crucial to this country’s
life—especially in matters of race,
education, housing, and employment,
Personal and university involve-
ment in Lexington would help us at
least as much as it would the town,

/on the nature of the subject matter

| velop. One possibility is intensive in-

WEL would employ 12-12-6 short term;

distribution requirements may be relaxed

The faculty Curriculum Committee, under the chairmanship of Prof. Henry S. Roberts,
has released its proposals for curriculum revision to the faculty. The Faculty Dicussion Club
will be revived to discuss the suggestions; appearances will be made by the student Curriculum
Committee members. Then the proposals will be presented to entire faculty for acceptance,
amendment, or rejection at a later meeing. The report to the faculty is published below in

its entirety:

|. Substitution of the Credit for the.

Semester Hour as the Unit of Credit.

This committee recommends that
all catalog course listings and require-
ments be expressed in terms of
CREDITS instead of semester hours.
The committee believes it to be de-
sirable to dissociate the concept of
credit given from the number of class
hours or meetings per week. Indi-
vidual courses might meet various
numbers of times a week depending

and the approach used and quite in-
dependently of the credit given. In
transition from the present system,
the listings of individual courses
would be converted on the basis of 1
semester hour equals 1 CREDIT. |
Instructors would be encouraged to}
reevaluate their courses and = ap-|
proaches to them in the light of
overall curriculum revisions and to
formulate proposals for desirable
changes. Such proposals would then
be subject to the existing system of
review and approval at the levels of
the department, Committee on
Courses and Degrees, and the general
faculty,

Il. The Adoption of a New Calen-
dar for the University.

A. This committee recommends
that the calendar of the College con-
sist of two long terms of 12 weeks
each and a short term of 6 weeks.
The pattern of two long terms and
one short term is increasingly com-
mon but the more usual arrange-
ment is a fall term of 13 weeks, a|
winter term of 4 weeks, and a spring |
term of 13 weeks. The function of |
the short term is to permit valuable |

 

 

educational experiences which can-|
not be accomplished in the usual |
semester format where the student

must divide his time and interest be-
tween several courses. There are many
possibilities which each department
would be asked to explore and de-

dividual or group study or research
on or off the campus. Imaginative
thinking should result in numerous
programs of real value to the indi-
vidual students, the various depart-
ments, and to the University.

A short term of 6 weeks rather
than 4 seems desirable to this com-
mittee. Greater flexibility would be a
major advantage. The committee be-
lieves that for some students it would
be advantageous to be enrolled in a
regular course for the short term
rather than to be engaged in special |
or independent study. Lower level
students may not be prepared to
benefit fully from these special pro-
grams. Others might benefit more by
moving more rapidly into areas of
special interest by taking a regular
course. Student failing a course dur
ing a long term might be able to
repeat the course during the short
term and thus forge ahead without
serious delay, A 6-week term is long}
enough to make it possible to offer
some intensive “summer school” type |
courses, Special programs, especially
those involving travel, would
benefit

B. This committee recommends that
the sequence of long and shori terms
be as follows

1. A fall term of 12 weeks be
ginning in September and ending,
including exams, before Chrisimas

2. A winter term of 12 weeks be
ginning immediately after Christmas
with final examinations completed be
fore spring holidays, about the first
week of April

1. A spring term of six weeks end
ing about the last of May

 

also

In this proposal the short term has
been placed at the end of the year
for the following reasons:

1. Year especially courses
such an introductory language and
mathematics, could be scheduled with

courses

, middle of a 30-week year might have

during the better weather conditions
of the spring term.

3. Special intensive study or re-
search programs could be continued
into the summer with only minor
interruption at the end of the aca-
demic year.

4. Students interested in moving
more rapidly into an area of special
interest could enroll in a more ad-
vanced course during the short term.

5. Students failing a course dur-
ing either long term might be able
to repeat the course during the short
term and thus be prepared to con-
tinue without interruption the fol-
lowing year.

There are also arguments in favor
of placing the short term immediately
after Christmas.

1. Having an 8-week interval in the

the desirable effect of providing a
break in the usual class routine and
result in the students approaching the

 

work of the rest of the year with

renewed energy and enthusiasm.

2. Certain types of special study
could be carried on only during the
middle of the year.

3. Special work carried on during
the 6-week term could, if unforeseen
events interferred, be completed under
supervision during the following long
term.

4. The majority of schools have
the winter short term and this sequ-
ence would make co-operative ar-
rangements more feasible. Admini-
Strative difficulties under either plan
would have to be resolved.

Il. Graduation Requirements and
Course Loads,

This committee recommends the
following changes from existing re-
quirements:

1. A total of 108 CREDITS would
be required for graduation. This
would make the normal student load
in any one term 4 courses instead of

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Dormitories and W&L’s future

This weekend, for the first time ever, freshmen at the Uni-
versity of Virginia were permitted to have women in their
dormitory rooms, on a very liberal basis. Outside of the normal
restrictions against noise, destruction, and so forth, the only
condition was that the parietal hours be rigidly observed (Fri-
day, 4 p.m. to 3 a.m.; Saturday, 11 a.m. to 3 a.m.; Sunday,
11 am. to 8 p.m.). The action came as a result of student
petition through normal channels—which in this case at Vir-
ginia does not include the faculty—and approval by President
Shannon and the Dean of Students. President Shannon em-
phasized that the freedom was on trial this weekend:

“No amount of external supervision will guarantee the success of the
parietal regulations as temporarily established for this weekend, or as they
shall be permanently established for the future. It cannot be stressed
enough that the ultimate success or failure of this system will be determined
by ... the First-Year Residents.”

Is this recent action at Virginia relevant to Washington
and Lee? We think so. Though not among a small minority,
W&L is nevertheless one of a decreasing number of universi-
ties (especially private) which do not allow women in men’s
dormitories. And there are good reasons for this—higher
education in the United States has long been steeped in the
traditional in loco parentis approach, which reasons “After
all, yould your parents allow you to entertain women in your
bedroom at home?” Of course not. What is being questioned
now is not the morality of allowing women in men’s bed-
rooms, but rather the comparison of pre-college life at home
with the free, on-your-own life in college.

We tend to view the comparison as invalid. For one thing,
it seems a rather incongruous stand for W&L staunchly to
deny parietals in the dormitories while turning a completely
blind eye toward the hundreds of student apartments. (The
same applies to the fraternity houses, as Reeve Kelsey has
tried to point out on numerous occasions.) The comparison
loses even more validity as the future of W&L is contemplat-
ed. Although it is often absurd to be fatalistic on any issue, it
cannot be denied that if W&L is to continue its prestigious
position (or improve it) among American universities, central
living facilities for all students is the number one priority.
Intellectual atmosphere at W&L is so void as to be negative,
which situation will not be remedied by gymnasium additions,
new academic buildings, a hundred thousand new books in
the library, or Premier Kosygin for Contact. Atmosphere is
a product of environment, and in order for W&L to generate
the intellectual atmosphere so important today in complement-
ing formal education, dormitories for all is the only solution.

This year, as two years ago when the Executive Committee
recommended sophomore dormitories, such a suggestion is
viewed with alarm—and justifiably so. Few W&L students
have been exposed to pleasant dormitory life, such as the
terraced, air-conditioned two- and three-man suites at Bowdoin
(which, incidentally, have been credited to a large degree with
regaining for Bowdoin the national prestige it once was on the
verge of forfeiting at the mercy of the apartment syndrome).

It should be obvious at this point that we are not talking
about the kind of dormitories W&L provides. But even aside
from the abominable physical condition of the structures,
there are constructive measures that could be taken to entice
freshmen to center more of their life in the dormitories, to
prepare the groundwork for student acceptance of required
dormitory residence, and ultimately to increase the interplay
among ideas and people, which is such an important aspect of
life everywhere except in many colleges (including W&L).

The two currently possible measures that immediately
come to mind are the establishment of liberal parictals and
the abolishment of restrictions against liquor in the dormi-
tories. But these measures can only preface the necessity of
building central living facilities for all students. We do not
wish to be so presumptuous as to accompany our views with
the sound of trumpets warning of imminent doom, but never-
theless—if it is to remain within the echelon of proud uni-
versities—Washington and Lee must begin by discarding the
outmoded tenets of in loco parentis or continue to find itself

providing mere instruction im loco education.

Keep distribution requirements

As we noted last week in publishing our faculty survey,
interpreting the results of polls is an imprecise series of un-
provable assumptions. We are nevertheless about to make
some observations on Jeff Spence’s poll in last Friday's edition.
To a slanted question “Do you think our present curriculum
has relevance to society?”, the majority of those polled answer-
ed “no.” To the question “Do you favor a choice of several
courses in different fields to fullfill requirements?”, the
response was overwhelmingly “yes.” It hardly takes a seasoned
pol to see the confusion. In simple terms, students would
like to choose among several fields, as long as the choice
of fields is theirs.

This is one instance in which we genuinely hope the
faculty will toke the student's opinion with an enormous grain
of salt. This editor was not alone in laboring through required
courses whose subject matter he had no desire at all to learn.
But is this inappropriate to higher education? We don’t think
so. Were the choice the students’, Washington and Lee would
become a small independent men’s trade school nestled in the
foothills of the Alleghenies.

This is not to say that the present system of distribution
requirements at W&L is good. It’s not. But in its evaluation
of the requirements and the proposals of the faculty Cur-
riculum Committee, hopefully the faculty will resolve the in-
equities as well as ensure each student a liberal arts education,
whether he wants it or not.

Sounding off...

By ROY CARLTON
Editorial-Page Editor

The waves of discontent that have
been sweeping over this country for
years are finally reaching Washington
and Lee. Despite the University’s at-
tempts to shut itself off from the
rest of the world, the message is now
reaching the W&L student, “Things
have got to change.”

While it’s true that this school can
no longer resist the forces of change
completely, some careful attention
should be given as to what changes
are made and how fast they are placed
in operation. The present student gen-
eration has been misdirected into
thinking that all change is good as
long as it changes. Nothing could
be further from the truth, and yet,
because of its long resistance to any
kind of reforms, W&L may very well
find itself discarding many of its
virtues in a furious attempt to make
up for the past. That would be
tragic, and might very well spell the
end of the University.

Washington and Lee has always
been a school for gentlemen, con-
servative to be sure, and always
conscious of General Lee’s memory.
As one of the few remaining out-
posts of conservatism in the nation,
Washington and Lee survives because
it appeals to such students and gives
them a refuge away from the Anti-
ochs, Benningtons, Berkeleys, and
now, Dukes. Were W&L liberalized
it is unlikely that it would be able
to syphon off enough of the good
liberal students to make up for its
loss of conservative ones. And it
would disturb the alumni.

Laugh all you want to, but the
alumni are an integral part of this
or any other university. And in a few
years you will be alumni. W&L will

 

be associated with your name and
you are just conservative enough to
want to be proud of it as it is now.

The conservatism of the W&L stu-

dent is a well established fact. It
is blared forth from such varied
sources as the DAR and _ Jack

Horowitz. Quite illogically, though,
the liberals on this campus claim that
because W&L is conservative (i.e. ‘It
just isn’t happening here’) the stu-
dents should revolt and liberalize it.
But the students are conservative, De-
spite the monstrous academic ques-
tions the University is presently apply-
ing itself to, the W&L man is still
thinking in terms of getting a ride
for his date from Hollins.

True, students here must be arous-
ed. But it is from apathy that they
must be roused and not conservatism.
Conservatism itself is not a bad thing.
Apathy is the problem, the kind of
apathy that prompts the W&L student
to want a short term because it
sounds like a six week vacation,

This has been a year of unprece-
dented change at this University. A
five-day week has been instituted,
pass-fail may be broadened, a short
term may come to pass, and distribu-
tion requirements are under review.
These are vital questions at Washing-
ton and Lee. The very fact that these
changes are being considered and
passed gives substance to the argu-
ment that it is not necessary to tear
down the school in order to reform it.

It is a very democratic libertarian
thing to say that we deserve our
rights, that the faculty has no author-
ity to stand in the way of the EC’s
resolutions, and that the Honor Trial
is the Washington and Lee version
of a Mississippi lynch mob. But these
things just aren't necessarily  state-
ments of fact because they sound
nice.

 

Conservatism versus change

The faculty, many of whom are
more liberal than the students, are
in accord with the general student
feeling that curriculum changes are
in order. They are sensitive to student
opinion, as was shown in last week’s
survey, and they have been through
the academic treadmill a lot longer
than we have. This is not just an
empty statement. It is evidenced by
the fact that almost everyone on
the faculty wants to change the pres-
ent grading system. The reason it
has not been done is that there are
so many alternatives that they have
come up with. They are a constructive
group on this campus, seeking to
change things by substituting some-
thing better, but only with something
better.

Of late, however ,the Honor Trial
has been the favorite whipping boy
of the vocal minority. It is charged
that by the EC’s secretive methods,
hundreds of students have been haul-
ed off in the middle of the night
and been forced to withdraw from
the University. But if the EC is so
tyrannical, why is it that so few
convicted students have chosen to
exercise their right of appeal? The
only conclusion must be that they
are guilty. Or else they don’t care
enough about the school to want to
stay, in which case their loss is
something short of tragic.

Should W&L liberalize over the
span of time, that is one thing. The
school will have had time to consider
and digest numerous proposals, and
it will hopefully accept only the bet-
ter ones. Change for the sake of
change, however, is destructive. It
has ruined St. John’s. It has de-
stroyed the image of Berkley to any-
one who might give money, includ-
ing the Regents. But at Washington
and Lee it would do its worst.

 

From the J-S...

By LAURENCE M. HILLIARD
Columnist

Will the administration treat its
students as men or teenagers? That
is the question at college campuses
across the country. Fortunately the
trend at Washington and Lee is
toward more responsibility for the
student.

This was not always the case.
Charles McDowell, Class of 1949 and
the Washington correspondent for the
Richmond Times-Dispatch, said the
administration treated the postwar
students, many veterans in their mid-
twenties, like school schildren. Twen-
ty-seven student demands were pre-
sented to President Gaines. Accord-
ing to McDowell, about twenty were
accepted.

The current administration treats
the student body like adults—mest
of the time. Bui the exceptions are
glaring.

lo begin with, consider the ODK
assembly last Friday. A required as-
sembly for college students? Ridicul-
ous! Not at WAL. So everyone has
to troop over to Doremus Gym-
nasium to hear “one of the nation’s
foremost educators” who regrettably
will no longer be among the academic
community because he has sold to

 

the Establishment. Judging by all the
empty seats, a sizable number of
students decided to pay the $2 fine
rather than hear the speech. Those
who heard the speech probably wish
they had made the same decision.
Let's leave required assemblies where
they belong—in high school.

The results of polls printed in the
last two Phis are encouraging. A ma-
jority of faculty members answering
favored extending the pass/fail idea
to the lower classes, and an almost
equal number favored increasing the
courses that can be taken pass/fail.
The students are overwhelmingly in
favor of an independent study course.
Both ideas have merit and deserve
consideration.

One pass/fail course for second
semester freshmen and sophomores
and two for juniors and seniors in
courses not necessary for graduation
would broaden the student's scope of
subjects able to be taken purely for
personal enjoyment and enlighten-
ment.

Unlimited cuts should also be ex-
tended to second semester freshmen
and sophomores. After a semester of
college, a student should be mature
enough to decide for himself how
often to attend classes, and nothing
more need be said on the subject.

 

Maturity rates responsibility

Independent study is one of the
best ideas conceived at W&L in many
a year. An independent study would
be an excellent chance for a junior
or senior to work on a project rele-
vant to his major. The student could
work out his topic with the head of
the department. As a suggestion, a
sociology major could spend the time
in Harlem and a geology major could
do field research. As a journalism
major, | would benefit from spending
the time working for a newspaper or
wire service. The horizons are limit-
less if the student is willing to work
seriously on an independent study,
and I'm sure that most students would
if they choose an interesting subject.

However, the Ring-tum Phi plan of
12-6-12 week schedule stands little
chance of faculty acceptance. The
faculty would consider it too much
time from classes, and some students
would spend the first four weeks lying
on the sands of Fort Lauderdale. A
13-4-13 week schedule would have a
much better chance of being accepted
by the faculty, and would give ade-
quate time for a project. Acceptance
of the independent study would show
that the faculty and administration
accept the student's status as a fully
mature adult.

The result of the finger pointing

Letters
To the Editor

Student attacks columnists

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

| would like to join the ranks of
the distinguished staff of the Ring-
tum Phi, and follow in the foot-
steps of one of the paper's outstand-
ing columnists—that — self-righteous
critic of “that self-righteous defender
of American patriotism (heaven for-
bid)—the D.A.R.” If I can join, I
will be only two steps behind that
great savior of mankind and enemy
of barbers who is “on the inside.”

My idol laments the fact that the
student body at the only 220-year-old
university in Lexington, Virginia,
does not represent a true cross-section
of the American people. | agree com-
pletely and appreciate his humility,
The percentage of students who re-
ceive financial aid here is actually
greater than the percentage of
Americans who receive welfare. The
admissions office should indeed be
more selective and should reassess its
policies in order to admit more who
do not have to worry about any-
thing but earthshaking affairs such
as whether to cut or not, The Hill
should realize that America is indeed
affluent, and = will always remain
affluent if our parents will just leave
us alone and send checks,

Students, especially —_ freshmen,
should take control of every facet
of life at W&L. We need experience
in running the world we soon will
take over. This suggestion is not en-
tirely original, and W&L will not be
the first institution to have such a
program. For example the upperclass-
men at V.M.I. seem to run their
school satisfactorily. As a matter of
fact, the cadets run it so efficiently
that each one has at least 3 hours a
day to devote to superfluous practices
such as studying. While the freshmen
at V.M.I. do not actively participate
in the running of the school, they
quickly learn to appreciate the ma-
turity of their elders (as do pledges
in W&L fraternities).

Since we are braying about every
atrocity on campus, we might as well
get our licks at those silly people who
speak at W&L about topics which
we intellectual activists do not quite
appreciate. What in the h--- are
scientists doing speaking at a liberal
arts university? Two distinguished
physicists in one week! What is a
radical to do?

I cannot quote my impressive sta-
tistics such as 99 percent to 1 per
cent or 614 to 714, but I can do the
next best thing and make some gentle-
manly radical proposals for bettering
our campus. For one, W&L should

W&L downs Centre in first game
but loses in finals to Southwestern

Washington and Lee’s initial game
of the College Athletic Conference
Basketball Tournament turned out to
be a relatively easy win. The Generals
outplayed the Praying Colonels from
Centre College by the score of 79-65.
WAL was assured of at least second
place as they advanced to the champ-
ionship game.

Neer and Cartwright each had
plenty of trouble in the foul depart-
ment. Both left the game with more
than eight minutes left on the clock,
but not before contributing a great
deal toward Washington and Lee's
win, “Magic” Mel Cartwright hit a
hot streak right after the second half
starter and finished the contest with

2 points. And lean and mean Mike
Sane controlled the back board jungle
once again.

But Southwestern was our tough-
est foe as the Generals had predicted.
In the finals the Lynx from South-
western proved a little too tough as

they defeated Washington and Lee,|*

73-55.
Washington and Lee was in trouble

 

 

 

 

 

from the first minute of the champ-
ionship game. Four fouls were called
on three starters before the half. The
Generals were never able to over-
come the early lead Southwestern
took.

One of the brightest aspects of the
game for Washington and Lee was the
outstanding play of Mike Daniel.
Daniel played his second straight out-
standing game as he was high scorer
in the finals with 16 points. In addi-
tion Mel Cartwright played impres-
sively enough to make the All-Con-
ference team for the second time in
three years. —John Robinson

After an almost successful come-
back after being down to Sewanee
by 26 points, the W&L swimming
team settled for a second in the
C.A.C, championship. The Blue, how-
ever, cracked 6 C.A.C. records and
set I! new school records.

Leading the assault on the record
book was Billy Ball who captured
his third consecutive Outstanding
Swimmer Award. For his effort he
won the 100 backstroke, 200 back-
stroke, 200 individual medley and led
off the winning 400 yard medley relay.
He set new C.A.C, championship
records in the 100 and 200 yard
backstroke (56.9 and 2:07.9) and the
200 individual medley (2:10.3) (mostly
breaking those he already held) and
the medley relay set a new C.A.C.
record.

Assisting in the attack was William

the EC would take a final vote. The
jurisdiction sub-committee, headed by
Danny Leonard, is taking two separate
routes in trying to simplify the honor
system,

A random survey is being taken to
determine where students believe the
jurisdictional limits lie; and Leonard
is conferring with the various depart-
ments in trying to draw up guidelines
for freshmen on the format of “Writ-
ten Work and The Honor System at
Washington and Lee.”

Leonard’s task met with opposition
from Dean of Students Atwood, who
feared Leonard was going to codify
the system (Leonard denied this) and
from Steve Sandler, who was afraid

' .
that this might also be the case. Pete

Curriculum proposals readied for debate by faculty

5. Our intent is to encourage the
student to achieve greater involve-
ment in those courses which he does
undertake. Instructors should be able
to provide greater depth and to ex-
pect a corresponding response from
students.

The achievement tests referred to
in IV-4 would not give credit toward
this requirement but credit could be
obtained, as at present, on the Na-
tional Advanced Placement Program.

2. 12-Week Terms,

The normal and minimum load
without special permission would be
12 CREDITS. The maximum load
without special permission would be
14 CREDITS.

3, 6-Week Term.

The normal and minimum load
without special permission would be
3 CREDITS with a permissible maxi-
mum of 6 CREDITS, or the equi-
valent in special studies, without
special permission.

4. All students would be required |
to register for all 3 terms.

1V. Distribution Requirements,

No area has caused this committee
more difficulty. We agree that some
distribution requirements are desir-|
able if students are to achieve a lib-
eral education characterized by a
variety of approaches to knowledge.
There is general agreement that a
reduction of distribution requirements
is necessary. There are differing opin-
ions, reflecting different philosophies,
to how the reduction should be
achieved and a division among us on
whether breadth, which all of us be-|
lieve desirable, should be encouraged
or required. The majority view is that
breadth in educational experience
should be obtained by requiring that
each graduate have experience and)
achieve minimum competency in sev-
eral broad areas (as evidenced by the
completion of courses or satisfactory
performance on achievement tests)
without specific course requirements,
\ minority, while in agreement with
these general objectives, believes that
certain specifics should be required of
all graduates and would require

Both majority and minority recom-
mendations are presented for your
consideration. That the two recom-
mendations are as similar as_ they
are reflects the attitude of compromise
which has characterized the delibera-
tions of the committee and also the
belief that the concepts underlying
these recommendations are more im-
portant than the exact modes of
their achievement.

The distribution requirements under
both plans are intended as require-
ments for the B.A. degree and also
the minimum for any other degree
awarded, Departments concerned with
awarding any other degree would
propose any additional requirements
which they feel desirable subject to

partmental or independent majors,

c. These requirements should be
completed as soon as possible, pre-
ferably by the end of the Sophomore
year,

3. The Minority Recommendation:

Distribution requirements would be
met by a minimum of 46 CREDITS
lor equivalent competence as de-
termined by achievement test (IV-4)|
chosen from the above divisions and
subject to the following restrictions:

a. 18 CREDITS in Division I, in-
cluding 6 CREDITS in English and
completion of the second year of an
ancient or modern foreign language.

b. 12 CREDITS in Division I,
with work in at least 2 of the depart-
ments listed,

c. 10 CREDITS in Division I,
with work taken in at least 2 of the
departments listed,

d. 6 CREDITS in Division IV.
| ¢, Courses may be used to satisfy
| both distribution and major require-
| ments.

4. Both recommendations specify
that the requirements listed could be
met by satisfactory performance in
| corresponding subject areas on Ad-
| vanced Placement Examinations or
achievement tests approved by the
departments concerned. Each depart-
ment would be urged to provide
achievement tests for this purpose.

 

V. Proposed future actions,

This committee regards these pro-
posals as only a first step but as an

 

 

}important one whose acceptance,
}amendment, or rejection by the
faculty will necessarly determine the
| nature of possible future actions.
| Should the faculty reject these pro-
| posals or amend them in such a

| manner as to disavow the concepts on
| which they are based, then this com-
| mittee should be discharged.

Dwelling Shortage Chronic

Housing Is The Problem

By WALT JACKSON

Students who have looked for an apartment to rent know
that it is not easy to find one. The problem of housing, how-
ever, is much more serious for the low-income families of
Lexington.

In an article on this page Ted DeLaney charges that Vir-
ginia Military Institute has aggravated the problem by acquir-
ing land in a poor, low income neighborhood south of Main
Street (see diagonally lined area on map). For several years
VMI has had a policy of gradually buying land as it comes
on the market. The school plans eventually to expand into the
area and now owns 18 of the 63 parcels in the sector. Much
of the land is rental property though there are some home-
owners.

Col. J. Carter Hanes, who directs VMI's development
program, claims that the institute, bordered by W&L on
the west and by a river on the north, has nowhere else to
expand. VMI, he says, has allowed tenants to remain in their
houses rent-free for up to three months after the house has
been sold. Asked if VMI has made any attempt to relocate

 

these people, he replied. “They are finding places on their |
dwellings are inadequate.

own, I presume.”

Many of the residents have experienced problems in find-
ing these places. Last year seven families were forced to move
when VMI acquired their dwellings in an estate. The only
homes some could find were in the county, away from their
community and from shopping areas.

About four years ago Col. Hanes attempted to persuade
the city of Lexington to apply for an urban renewal project
in which federal funds would be available for planning and
for relocation of displaced families. The city government de-

28 houses with inadequate plumb-

The information above. as stated.
concerns itself only with dwellings
located within the illustrated area.
There are many more such areas, al-

though not nearly as large or as
condensed as the one in question.
The U. S. Bureau of Housing in

1960 lists 1.959 housing units in Lex-
ingion. Of this total, 338 were con
sidered by the federal government to
be deteriorating and 161 to be di-
lupidated.

Many of these. particularily those
situated on the fringes of Lexington,
are worse off, lacking many of the
benefits that are present within the
city proper. Water, for example, for
many of these people, poses a very
real and perplexing problem. Piped
water in these areas is ofien a luxury.
Many are forced to transport water
to their places of residence. and there
is evidence that some are actually
drinking drain water collected from
highway runoff. Government officials
have taken samples of many of the
present sources of water and have
informed these people that much of
it is not fit for human consumption
it is one thing to inform those in
question that their water is con-
taminated: it is quite another to pro
vide them with an alternative source

A responsible spokesman of the
South Main community—one who
was born and raised there-—com-
menied that the situation is “de

sponsibility of rectifying this situation
lies in the realm of city government,

A View From The Other Side Of Main

An Editorial

Walk On The Other Side

Where is the other side of Lexington?

Look across the street and you'll see it.

Who lives on the other side of Lexington?
Look around you and you'll see its inhabitants.

Here we are—students at Washington and Lee, the home
of the Southern Gentleman. We live on the prosperous side
of the street, in which we pay a comprehensive tuition fee of
$1900 a year to get an education. According to Dean of Ad-
missions, James D. Farrar, each one of us can expect to spend
$3400 a year at W&L. (This figure includes tuition, food,
board, books, entertainment and miscellaneous expenses.) This
is astronomical when we consider that the average worker in
Lexington and Glasgow earns from $3000-$5000 a year (ac-
cording to Miss Sharon Henderson, secretary of the Rock-
bridge Area Community Action Program).

We believe that every Washington and Lee student should
walk into the areas on the other side of the street at least
once in the four years he is here. What he will see be poverty,
unhappiness, inadequate facilities and lack of opportunity.
In other words, he will be walking right in the middle of slums
occupied by both white and black families—all this directly
across the street from a “rich boys’ school” and a state military
school.

We feel as if we have an obligation to society to try to
aid others try to attain the same luxuries we now enjoy. After
all, one of the reasons we are not now in the same position
as those people on the other side of Lexington is chance, i.e.,
we were lucky enough to be the children of parents whose
conditions, for the most part, have not required us to live in
poverty. Granted, we feel we have an obligation to “make
something of ourselves,” to become “successful” and to pay
back in some way those who have invested so much in our
lives. But, we will not consider ourselves successful or feel we
have made the most of our lives by counting the amount of
money we earn. It is true money will be important in raising
our families and living comfortably. However, we can become
rich in another way by helping others.

This is certainly idealistic. But we are still young and
relatively carefree. Now is the time for us to have ideals.
What we fear is that too many W&L students have lost their
ideals. We fear that too many W&L students are set in their
ways, acting and thinking like 30 year-old men. We fear that
Wa&lL men, who have so much to offer to others, are solely
concerned with themselves. This self-interest, which often ex-
hibits itself as selfishness, has blinded many of us to the needs
of others. This in itself is the main reason for apathy on
campus. It’s not lack of time; it’s lack of interest in others.

Therefore, we would like to challenge you, as Kirk Wood-
ward did in Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi. We ask you to expand
your view of yourself to discover the world around you,
Begin in Lexington. The problems in Lexington are similar
to those of all cities in the world. People here need help, and
we are in an excellent position to help them.

rhe poor of Lexington do not ask us for money, They
ask us for our time and our understanding. One group which
has ipproached us to ask for student aid is the Rox kbridge
Area Community Action Program. This organization was
established to help the local poor achieve better working condi-
tions. The members of this group help the workers band
together to dispel the fear they have to speak up for better
working conditions, which in many places are atrocious.

The Rockbridge Area Community Action Program is just
one of many roups composed of blacks and whites, poor and
middle class, who are working to to make Lexington a better
place for everyone to live in. (Anyone desiring information on
the Rockbridge Area Community Action Program or any other
groups should contact James H. Smith in Buena Vista.)

Let this be a challenge to all of you. Look at others less
fortunate than you and realize how good you really have it.

Housing Is The Problem

(Continued from Page 2)

The corporation, set up under the
1965 Federal Housing Act and chart-
ered on May 3, 1968, has obtained
an option to buy approximately eight
acres Of land for the purpose of con-
structing the units. The area is bound-
by Lewis Street, Diamond Street
(extended), and the Lexington Bypass,
Route 11A.

Dr. Hodges reported that a survey

indicated that there was “severe over-
crowding in at least twenty dwellings,”
and that a number of dilapidated
dwellings exist within the city limits.

According to Dr. Hodges, if the
application is approved, work could
begin in six months, although he
cautioned that the time period seemed
optimistic to him. He anticipates a 9

Dr. Hodges believed the project, if
it goes through, will “loosen up” the
housing situation in Lexington and
force rents down in the community,

Since VMI proceeding rather

not share the view of Ted De Laney

tossed out.”

Spring Sports Jump The Gun

Tennis

The W&L tennis team is returning
one of our strongest teams this
spring. Coach Canfield has only the
highest praise for his seven return-
ing lettermen, including Captain Tom
Rueger, seniors Ray Turman and Don
McClure, juniors Tom McJunkin,
Rick Armstrong, and Mike Spoor, and
sophomore Bill Gatlin rounding out
the group. Among these men there
are five Conference champs return-
ing, and the possibility of a third
straight CAC Championship looks ex-
cellent.

Coach Canfield has not heard of any

This year’s schedule apepars to be
tougher than most in the past with
big-name schools such as Maryland,

Bucknell on the list, all of whom
are subsidized. Coach Canfield’s ex

 

planation of this is that his men
would rather play against hard com-
petition than against some of the!

softer small-college competition found |
in the area. It will be tough to better ,

Canfield is optimistic that this team

It is Szlasa’s hope that the practices
will help to mature his young team
as rapidly as possible. Thus the goal
or the February program has been
conditioning in order that the scrim-
mage can be essentially learning ex-

periences rather than conditioning
periods.
Depite a strong nucleus of re-

turning lettermen, the prospects of
the team depend to a great extent on
the speed with which some of the
freshmen and untested upperclassmen
develop. The defense, anchored by
goalie Pete Nowick and co-captain
Charlie Stewart, is the area in which
competition is greatest. Returning let-
termen Ned Coslett and Tom Mul-
lenix are a strong unit by boys
like Frank Stearns and Bob Radcliffe,
up from last year’s “B” squad, and
freshman Tommy Smith are present-
ing a strong challenge. At midfield
there is not much depth. Upperclass-
men Whit Morrill, co-captain Bart
Goodwin, Tom Robson, and Rocky
Kimball are receiving help from a
group of freshmen that includes Scott
Neese, Jim McKane, Tim Criss, and
fodd Morrill. The attack, weakened
by the graduation of Chip Chew and

 

Tom Pittman, is working expecially
hard to develop into a smooth and
cohesive unit. Lettermen Tom Groton,
Joe Wich, and Dick Capron, backed ;
Craig Galpern, will supply the
nucleus with help from freshmen and
last year’s “B” squad.

Track

The WAL track team will hold a
meeting for all interested persons
on Monday at 2:00 in the projection
room upstairs in the gym. Coach
Walden is hopeful of a large turnout
because of the lack of depth present
at the time. There are a large num-
ber of returnees, however, but mostly
spread oul over many events, with
fewer than two men returning in most
events. The sprints boast the return

 

best one we have.

The depth of the team is still

in question however, and the outcome |

will be seen only when practice form

VMI during the winer, Coach Walden
reports, but that not enough people
have participated to make any real

Baseball

This year’s baseball squad should
be one of the most versatile squads
W&L has seen in a long time. With
a little more age and experience than
usual, the baseball team is confident
it will better the 8-10 record of last
year. Last year’s record was the best
since 1961, and with very few losses
form last year’s squad, experience
and versatility are our key hopes.
The only losses from last year’s squad
were Captain Bill Rasmussen, and
freshman pitcher John Botcheller who
transferred to NYU,

The corps of returnees is led by
co-captains Jim Wilson and Thom
Mitchell, both seniors. Wilson led the
team last year with a .360 batting
average and a .608 slugging average.
He was also third in the U.S, Col-
lege Division in triples. Mitchell as
a pitched had the lowest ERA of

anyone on the team, and had a 5-3 |
| behind Virginia

record, the most victories for a W&I

pitcher in ten years. His bat did not |

suffer as a result, though, as evidenc-

led by his .310 batting average. Other

seniors returning are pitcher Lee
Halford and shortstop Gil Fitzhugh.
Pitchers Return

Other pitcher returning besides
Mitchell and Halford include Steve
Mahafee, returning after a year's

absence, freshmen Bill Greener, Jim
Noland, and Bill Miller, Last year’s
infield is all back and intact with
sophomore Ray Coates at first base.
junior John Nolan at second, Gil
Fitzhugh at short, and Steve Kalista,
junior transfer student, at third.
Back-ups include freshmen Bo
Brookby at third and John Robinson
at first. At catcher returns John
Baizley for his third season. In the
outfield is Thom Mitchell, who is
also our star centerfielder, Jim Wilson
in left, and Scott McChrystal in right.
Back-ups include Chris Coursen, who
plays either right or center, and
Dave Brooks, who can play the out-
field or second base.

a

With this group returning, results
this Spring look more promising than
in the past. WAL has strong hitting,
especially in Jim Wilson and Scott
McChrystal. Pitching is stronger than
in the past with three upperclassmen
returning and three freshmen to back-
The outfield and infield are back
in their entirety and this all points
toward a solid team.

The baseball team opens its season
March 21 on its home field against
Cleveland State.

 

 

Golf

The W&L golf team returns to
the links when official practice be-
gins on March 3, This does not mean,
however, that the golfers have been
idle since last May. On the con-
trary, they have been practicing indi-
vidually since the beginning of
school, weather permitting, and
Captain Gary Silverfield expects a
strong team this year having lost no
one to graduation last year,

The team is probably one of the
most experienced W&L has had in
years. Seniors Gary Silverfield, Bobby
Matthews, and Bill McLeod have all
played since their Freshman year,
Dick Singletary, an able addition, is
the only junior on the team, with
Jim Gordon and Ken Carter the re-
turning sophomores rounding out the
corps of returnees. Also senior Gil
lurner is coming out after a year’s
absence. There are several Freshman
hopefuls, including Bill Martin and
John Gunner.

Last year’s squad compounded a
7-1-1 record and placed second in
CAC Tournament. In the State
tournament the Generals placed fifth
lech, Virginia, Wil-
liam & Mary, and Old Dominion.
This year’s schedule looks to be much
the same as last year’s, and with no
losses the squad expects to do as
well or better this season. With the
able coaching of Mr. Twombly and
Buck Leslie, the assistant coach, we
see no reason to doubt their expecta-
tions,

The Generals will compete on the
links for the first time on April 9,
with Hampden-Sydney. Fans are
cordially invited to view the rout
at the Lexington Golf Course. They'd

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

The natural bridge {I}

In the first edition of this newspaper, we tried to point
out the disadvantages of freshman camp at Natural Bridge
tend to outweigh the advantages, how the very valuable aspects
of pre-matriculation orientation are often lost in the childish
and annoying fare that typify freshman camp. We weren’t
successful; no one in the administration seems to place a re-
evaluation of the present orientation on any list of priorities
at all.

This edition surveyed a random sampling of the freshman
class, 103 of those enrolled (which means that hypothesizing
about the entire class will be extremely accurate.) A majority
(57°,) felt that freshman camp contributed to, rather than
detracted from, their ability to adjust to Washington and Lee.
And 78°, replied that the goals of camp are legitimate. This
is certainly encouraging, but...

To the question, “Would you be in favor of or opposed
to the continuation of freshman camp as it now exists?”, 67%
said they would be opposed. And, 85% favored moving fresh-
man camp to the campus.

Note that the feeling is that the goals of freshman camp
are recognized as valuable, and even more are accepted.
But why must there be a camp held in adverse conditions
15 miles away from the campus? Freshman assimilation could
be so much more pleasant and very likely more beneficial if
it were effected right here on campus.

Staff editorial

In defense of liberal education

One of the explicit purposes of this University is “to pro-
vide the essentials of a liberal education to all undergraduates
before they separate into their fields of specialization;” (page
49, Catalogue). With due regard to the atmosphere of change
circulating between the columns of our staid colonnade, we
earnestly hope that the faculty will not abandon this objective
in its action on the Curriculum Committee’s proposals con-
cerning reform of the distribution requirements.

As we all know, the current instrument used to accomplish
this purpose is the distribution requirement. Most students
apparently prefer some reform in this system due to the drudg-
ery of toiling through required courses which are often not
relevant to their own particular interests. However, how
many freshmen and sophomores are absolutely sure of what
their particular interests are? We suggest that a majority of
students graduate with a different major than the one they
intended to pursue when they entered W&L. Perhaps, with-
out adequate distribution, these students might not have come
to this realization.

Distribution requirements do perform a necessary function
in enhancing the possibility of using more intelligent freedom
in making a wise choice of a major. Even in those cases when
a student may actually be ready to specialize in his select dis-
cipline in his freshman year, distribution prevents him from
gaining an undesirable lopsided approach to knowledge.

The issue puzzling the Curriculum Committee is not
whether breadth is necessary to a liberal education—we agree,
it simply is—but whether a wide perspective should be en-
couraged or required.

Having considered these observations, we urge that the
minority recommendation of the Curriculum Committee's pro-
posals for distribution reform be more closely followed (see
last week’s Tuesday Ring-tum Phi). Basically, the minority
recommendation requires certain specifics of all graduates and
a broader learning experience than the majority recommenda.
tion. We feel that the requirements of the major recom-
mendation are too lax to ensure adequate breadth, For ex:
ample, a student could feasibly graduate without ever taking
an English course! Granted English courses do not appeal
to each and every student here, but English is an essential
and necessary part of a liberal arts curriculum—perhaps the
upper level courses would be more appealing and challenging
to freshmen with four entrance units of credit (required). |

We suggest that the faculty consider abolishing certain
prerequisite courses as a means of requiring breadth of study
on a reformed basis. For example, the minority recommenda.
tion requires six credits in English, but why does this have to
be English 1, 2 (prerequisites for most higher level courses)
For a student to take a course in English which really chal-
lenged his interests, he would under usual circumstances have
to wait until his sophomore year. The preservation of prere-
quisites in cases like this, somewhat offsets the advantageous
decrease in number of hours for distribution.

This points out another significant advantage in the mi-
nority recommendation—the provision allowing distribution
requirements to be used for major requirements should they
coincide. This is especially valuable in departments such as
economics where the average student is unexposed to such
study in high school. In these cases introductory courses are
definitely necessary to enable the student to lay a foundation
in his freshman year for later study. This would also give
the student time in his second year to investigate the subject
deeper before deciding in what area he will specialize.

In short, the current system of distribution, while fulfilling
a just and necessary purpose, does need a certain easing 2
clear the path for more flexibility. However, caution shoul
© as not to relax restrictions to the point where the
desirable end—ensuring the broad

From the J-School...

By LAURENCE M,. HILLIARD
Columnist

Last week at dinner, a_ student
looked up from my column in The
Ring-tum Phi asked me “Why do
you always knock the University?
Why don't you ever say anything
nice about it? Isn't there anything
you like about Washington and Lee?”

Since I admire the courage of
anyone who will read my column
while eating, I feel he deserves an
answer. The reason | am always
Knocking W&L is because I see my-
self, the columnist, as a sort of un-
glorified social commentator. There
are many things | like about the
University, but there are also some
things | do not like, and I hope that
by presenting my beefs in print, I
can, in some small way, contribute
to the rectification of these situations.

My first column three weeks ago
extolled the virtues of coeducation.
Since that time, a faculty member has
circulated a petition for coeducation
at W&L. I do not know if my column
contributed to this turn of events,
but I like to feel that it provided
well needed food for thought on the

subject. My next column was on
campus apathy—an article which
drew a letter of attack from Tom

Whetstone. Although I do not agree
with Mr. Whetstone’s views, I am
encouraged that he took the time to
write the letter. Obviously, he is
neither apathetic nor indifferent to

campus fanatics are in heat. How
easy to practice flagellation and be-
moan that Big Issue, the Bogeyman
(or Blue Meanie?) of all campuses:
Apathy. Define the indecipherable.
We can't, they can't. But, I dare
Suggest that like so many reformers
they find it far easier to debate the
number of devils on the head of a
pin than to clear off one.

Talk is cheap, me Irish mother
used to say. But then, so is all
movement. And we must never. chil-
dren, confuse movement with action.
A dynamite blast below the statue
of Cyrus McCormick: that’s move-
ment. It gets you nowhere. Or to
be more specific: tackle a problem
by appointing a committee. Again
we usually find ourselves nowhere—
through more subtly so. To repeat,
talk is cheap.

After much deliberation the Cur-
riculum Committee issues its recom-
mendations, emphasizing research,
individual initiative, the unbinding of
the vigorous mind to journeys of in-

 

 

campus events. I plan to continue
writing controversial articles in the
hope that I can arouse student  in-
terest and action.

But getting back to the original
question—there are things I like
about W&L. So for this week, I am
going to put away my poison pen
long enough to tell of some of these
things I do like.

Washington and Lee has two ma-
jor advantages going for it—an ex-
cellent faculty and an equally excel-
lent reputation, Take away either,
and you would inevitably lose the
other. An excellent faculty is neces-
sary for the maintainance of the
reputation and an excellent reputa-
tion is necessary in order to attract a
high quality faculty.

The Ring-tum Phi conducted a
student rating of faculty members in
December, About 40 percent of the
senior class graded faculty members
in six categories from 1—‘Superior”
—to 5S—‘Terrible.” The Ring-tum
Phi commented on the results, saying,
“The students were, on the whole,
too lenient . . . . The mean score
for the entire faculty for each
criterion should be ‘Average,” ie., 3.
For five of the six criteria the aver-
age (mean) is lower, and thus more
favorable to the faculty.” This is not
surprising, The faculty is far better
than “Average,” as the poll indicates.
Sure there are some clinkers in the

Barbs and Bristles ...

One cargazon of ramblings

; tellect yet uncharted. Bully for you,
Curriculum Committee. And a double |

huzzah for those fiery revolutionaries
led by Dave Katz who have emerged
from the bowels of the Library with
the Student Progressive Alliance
(sounding oddly reminiscent of T.R.’s
Progressive Party and of the Farm-
er’s Alliance, both founded o’er a
half century ago. Crafty young
radicals.) Hurrah for these groups who
decry apathy on the campus that
General Lee built! And when the
cheers have ended and the lights in
the zealot’s eyes are dulled, what
then? There are sixty-nine organs of
the Student Body listed in the Uni-
versity Register. We don't count the
officers of the classes or the Ex-
ecutive Committee or the fraternities.
We don't count the prestigious John
W. Davis Society (headed by the
President of or the Freeport Tuna
Society “All men are basically fish.”)

We assume these organs to be
functioning with one or several mem-
bers apiece, Certainly when a relative-
ly small student population such as
ours is, Can support some three score
and nine such as those are, we are

W&L ain’t so bad after all

faculty—it’s inevitable. But they are
scarce. In three years, I’ve only had
two poor professors and about ten
that are excellent. The poll listed
eighteen professors with an overall
performance rating of “Superior.” The
greatest compliment that can be given
a professor is to have a student take
his course just to have the professor—
a common occurence at W&L. How
many students do you know who will
take a course from a Dr, Colvin or
a Dr. Jarrett because of the profes-
sor. Presently | am taking Sociology
102 because of Dr. Leyburn. (In case
you think I’m saying this to get a
better grade, let the record show that
I'm taking the course pass/fail.)

An excellent reputation is not as
tangible as an excellent faculty, but
it is no less important. If you do not
believe this, just wait until you apply
for employment or graduate school.
Or better yet, tell anybody in the
South where you go to college, and
I guarantee that they will be duly
impressed,

I could mention many other things
I like about W&L—a President who
will talk to anybody on any subject
at almost any time, an athletic pro-
gram that allows any student  in-
terested to compete on the varsity
level, a newspaper that prints my
trash every week—but I have to end
now in order to sharpen up my fangs
for an attack on some unsuspecting
element of campus life next week.

 

not apathetic.

| So mirable dictu, the dragon be-
, comes a windfall and we can all go

_my fine laddie-bucks!

To quote another economics major,
“There is a spectre stalking . . .” One
might suggest that the spectre is not
apathy but mediocrity, a complacent
attitude toward quality. (How else do
you think newspapers such as_ this
one, and its fin de semaine counter-
part survive?).

If it doesn't charley-horse an un-
used muscle, think about the stand-
ards maintained in this red-bricked
microcosm. One's mind boggles at the
lack of excellence. We could tiptoe
lightly across the toes of the three
score and some odd Presidents, Chair-
men and Fuhrers of the campus
organizations, We could trod upon
them sharply. We shall do neither,
or now, and leave this cargazon of
medocrity to your imagination, One
only suggests that we appraise. Look
to yourselves and your leaders. “Many
are chosen but few are called.” (or

In praise of Lawrence

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

Issue No 31 (of the Eighteenth)
included a most interesting column
under the signature of Fran Lawr-
ence, Please convey my compliments
to this gentleman for his efforts.

He enjoys the luxury of his youth
(his missive got on to the point
that your typesetter tired and put
“treat” for “threat”). Recourse to
Roget, 3.1; “Objectivity” should give
him a lead to the definition of “Uni-
versity.” I would suggest that this
is quite definitely “Thesis Material”
and hope that he will use the talents
of a finely honed mind to produce
further and expanded material. If he
is in Journalism, a great many are
going to be forced to improve.

Baffling outburst

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

To the Phi’s recent and truly
baffling outburst of demagogy on the
the “other side of Lexington” it seems
in order to offer some manner of
reply and rebuke. This writer's
indignation over the public airing of
such a matter is almost too deep to
find adequate expression, Still .
one tries. Perhaps it will suffice to
establish, at least to propose, a single
point, The advancement of civilzation
has invariably been achieved through
the cultivation of the arts and the
direction of politics by a relatively
privileged class (or alliance of classes)
whose life-laboring and sometimes im-
poverished inferiors have been obliged
to support and to render as easy as
circumstances permitted. Concern for
the conditions of daily existence
among these unfortunate was not, and
presumably could not wisely have
been, keenly felt by the genteel classes.
To toss down a few crumbs from
the table was enough — “noblesse
oblige,” but not extravagantly! It ap-
pears quite legitimate, and at this
moment necessary to wonder whether
the Sistine frescoes, the Medici
tombs, the palaces and pavilions of
Versailles, and the work of Haydn
and Mozart would have come into
the world if Popes and kings and
merchants and nobles had not largely
ignored what our great-grandparents
called “the social question” and opted
instead for art and beauty. (Only in
the twentieth century have we dis-
covered how easily art and beauty
can be divorced.)

The question, in short, is entirely

Bucky Cunningham

Bucky Cunningham didn’t even go}
out for football in his freshman and |
sophomore years, but after two years |
of astounding success, Bucky finds
himself leaving W&L with two all-

time school grid records. Now, he
also finds himself as the Ring-tum
Phi’s Football Player of the Year.

It may seem surprising that an

offensive player could be chosen from
a team which found so much dif-
ficulty in scoring, especially at the
beginning of the year, Bucky's ac-
complishments can hardly be exag-
gerated, though, Last year in his first
year of football, Bucky set the W&L
record for most receptions in a sea-
son. In this, his senior and final
season, he celebrated by tying his
record of a year old and adding to
it the mark for most passing yardage
in a season. Quite remarkable for one
who didn’t even figure in the Gen-
erals’ plans two years ago,

In recognition of his efforts, Bucky ,
has been selected All-State and All-
CAC for the past two seasons, His
receptions and yardage led the league
this year for the second time in
a row.

Although he was used several times
on end around in which he
picked up some good yardage, it was
speed and great hands that brought
Bucky his success. Operating trom
the flankerback position, Bucky was
fast enough to breeze past any op-
ponent he faced all year, as evidenced
by the fact that he was Chuck Kuhn's
favorite target for the bomb

Mel Cartwright

Mel Cartwright, a PiKA from
Martinsville, Virginia has established
himself as one of the best basketball
players in the state by his junior
year. As a freshman, “Magic” Mel
was a small college All-American
honorable mention. This year, Mel
led the team in scoring with almost
a 20-point-per-game average; and
once again made the all conference
squad,

Phroughout the state, Cartwright
has amazed his opponents with his
floating lay-ups and his receptive pass-
ing. Mel has also taken his share of

 

punishment under the boards where
he has the team’s record for most!
rebounds in one game.

Whenever Mel Cartwright had}
teamed with W&L’s other big man, |

relation to both of his captains, “two

Harry Zeliff

Player of the Year from Washing-
ton and Lee's cross-country team is
team captain Harry Zeliff. Harry, a
senior PhiEP from Staunton, Vir-
ginia, led his squad to a winning 6-5
season.

At the outset of the season, Zelifl
set a course record for W&L as the
Harriers jumped off to a quick 4-0
record. The cross country team ran
into strong state competition later in
the season but finished third in the
College Athletic Conference meet in
Danville, Kentucky.

Harry Zeliff is to be succeeded by
David Haydu and Paul Wilbur, co-
captains of the 1969 cross-country
season. Hopefully, they will be able
to provide the same effective leader-
ship which characterized Zeliff and
earned him the title Player of the
Year.

Besides his athletic activities, Harry
has involved himself in many other
extracurricular obligations. He has
served as an officer in his fraternity;
and he has also been active in both
the Troubadour Theater and the
Circle K. Finally, Zeliff has been on
the Dean’s List for the past two
years, —Cal Whitehurst

the Honor System Committee estab-
lished to investigate procedural
changes in the System. The pro-
posals contained herein are the re-
sult of considerable discussion among
both other EC members and the three
faculty advisors President Huntley,
Mr. McThenia of the Law School,
and Dean of Students Atwood. The
study stemmed from the Executive
Committee’s concern over the in-
justces and inconsistencies inevitable
in the present procedure. At the out-
set, it would be profitable to outline
the framework in which this commit-
tee contained its activities and based
its decision.
1) The Executive Committee shall re-
tain its present organizational struc-
ture.
2) The Executive Committee shall
maintain its role of an investigatory
body in all honor cases. Its purpose
shall be to ascertain the facts and to
render a judgement based on those
facts. Any movement toward an ad-
versary system should be avoided.
3) A greater degree of consistency
between EC hearing and Student Body
hearing should be sought. The em-
phasis in both cases should be on
gathering the facts of the case and
not on civil procedure,
4) An effort should be made to insure
the knowledge of the accused con-
cerning the case.
In accordance with the above
guidelines, Mr. Hendricks and | have
developed the following procedural
changes and recommend that they
be adopted by the Executive Com-
mittee. These proposals have also met

with the approval of our faculty
advisors to this committee. It is our
joint consensus that all of these

recommendations are in the best in-
terests of the Student Body and the
Honor System at Washington and
ise.

1) The Executive Commitee should
follow a modified procedure prior to
the beginning of a hearing as fol-
lows. After a suspected honor viola-
tion, a number of Committeemen
shall gather evidence. The entire EC

| will be called together and determine
| whether or not a hearing is necessary.

If so, all witnesses must be con-
tacted prior to $:00 p.m. the day
of the hearing. The accused must be
informed of his status with a brief
description of the offense involved
no later than §:00 p.m. of the day
or the hearing, but not before 4:00
p.m. the same day. The EC hearing
will begin at 7:00 p.m. or for good
reason, at President's discretion.

(The accused will be told pre-
cisely of what he is accused, On
suggestions by Steve Sandler, 1)
24 hours instead of 2 will be given
the accused party. Our readers will
remember that Ron Kessler sug-
gested such an amendment at an
earlier EC meeting. 2) The accused
will be required to read and sign
a statement consisting of his rights
and the procedure.)

2) Every accused student be

Which can occur at any time. In
addition, the accused will be given
time to ask questions of the witnesses
only after all EC questioning is com-
pleted. (The EC reserves the right to
ask questions at any time), The fol-
lowing are proposals for modifications
of the Student Body Hearing:

1) The Chairman of the hearing shall
be the President of the Student Body
or in his absence, the Vice-President.

(Another EC member may be
designated Chairman. The accused
may suggest to the President that
any particular person not be Chair-
man, which suggestion the Presi-
dent may accept or reject.)

2) It shall be the duty of the Chair-
man to present a brief summary of
the facts of the case in question to
the jury prior to the presentation
of testimony.

(The “facts” here must be the
same ones disclosed in the original
EC trial. Counsel for the accused
must approve them beforehand.)
| 3) Every effort should be made to
| keep the hearing free of legal loop-
| holes and technicalities. To that end,
ithe Chairman shall have final de-
i termination of all rules of procedure
and evidence. The hearing should be
conducted as a fact-finding investiga-
tion, not as a civil court proceeding.
(The jury will be allowed a pause
for recess affer both cases, that
for the defense and that for the
prosecution, so that they may write
down notes without interrupting or
ignoring continuing testimony.

4) The advisor to the aceused  stu-
dent should be an undergraduate, as
should the EC counsel, possibly a
member of the EC. W&L Law School
advisors to undergraduate students
are undesirable but not prohibited.
5) Following the examination of any
witness, the members of the jury may
have the opportunity to ask questions
of the witnesses or recall any witness
will be at the direction of the
Chairman,

6) The number of preemptory chal-
lenges to jury selection will be in-
creased from (4) to ten (10) for each
side.

7) It will be the responsibility of
the Chairman to appoint two mem-
bers of the jury to give “guilty” and
“not guilty” summations.

This commitiee also strongly

 

recommends that such changes as
above not be included as amendments
to the Student Body Consitution. It
is our feeling that such action would
destroy the flexibility of the ad-
ministration of the Honor System and
would eventually lead to undesirable
and unchangeable situations.
* *

Point number 3, the right of the
accused to be present during question-
ing of the witnesses, was included (ac-
cording to Hendricks and Passavant)
in an effort to make secret honor trial
procedure consistent with student
body hearing procedure.

Concerning student body hearings,
point number 3 concerning “loop-
holes” was a marked change from the
present system whereby  Viriginia
Codes are employed as procedural
guides,

Secretary Judson Simmons suggest-
ed that in selecting the prospective
jury list from the student body, the
EC should include ex officio the fra-
ternity presidents, chairmen of stand-
ing committees, etc., to ensure a more
responsible jury. His arguments in
favor of this system were that less
peremptory “strikes” would be used
since both counsel would be assured
of perhaps a better general calibre.

oe
*

EC recommendations on the Honor System presented to students

The arguments against this idea were
that many names would be duplicates
and that this was not “jury of his
peers” in its bias. The suggestion was
not adopted.

Ron Kessler, the sole spectator
(Editor’s note: where are all those
who complain about secrecy,  ete.,

such as Jeff Spence, Jack Horowitz,
and the PSA? Sorry, couldn't resist
this.), suggested that the student body
be allowed to express its sentiments
on the recommenadtions by voting in
the Spring. He added that this would
not take the form of a Constitutional
amendment, but would be effected
only to gain a consensus, or lack of
it. The EC concurred with this recom-
mendation.

Also discussed at some was the
question of where a student body
hearing should be held. Passavant

said that all three advisors had been
in agreement that the new EC room
in the student union building should
be used. There was general objection
from the EC to this, however, on the
bases of 1) general disruption and
2) limited audience (which, however,
most agreed would not be entirely
objectionable.) The EC resolved, by

 

8-4 vote, to retain Lee Chapel as
the site.

Washington and Lee University and
seven other private colleges in Vir-
| ginia and North Carolina which are
| predominantly mens or women’s
institutions have initiated discussions
of a student exchange among these
institutions.

The presidents of Davidson, Hamp-
den-Sydney, Hollins, Mary Baldwin,
Randolph-Macon College, Randolph-
| Macon Woman's ¢ ollege, Sweet Briar
j}and W&L held an initial meeting re-
cently Randolph-Macon Woman's
| College.
“They expressed a strong interest
in a student exchange and decided
to continue their exploration of ways
'in which such a program might be
| implemented,” said R-MWC President
William F. Quillian Jr., who con-
| vened the meeting.
| According to the plan under dis-
cussion, a student in any of the
eight colleges might attend another
of the participating colleges for a year
or possibly for a semester, Dr. Quil-
lian said. Each college would pre-
sumably indicate the number of such
exchange students it could accept in
a given year or semester.

He noted two major advantages of
program. “One is that it would
extend the range of courses available
,;to the students in these colleges.

| Thus, a student could take advantage
of the strengths of each college in
the group,” he said. “Also, it would
afford a diverse educational experi-
ence for the exchange students and
give each of the colleges a limited
coeducational experience.”

At the present time discussions are
very tentative, according to Dr.
Quillian. “If details of this program
can be worked out in a way that
seems desirable and feasible to the
colleges engaged in these discussions,
the plan would then be submitted to
the respective governing bodies of
these institutions for their approval,”
he said.

A second meeting of the presidents
of the eight colleges is scheduled for
March If in Lynchburg.

Shortly the first
President E. R. Huntley ap-
pointed nine faculty and admini-
strative staff members and one stu-
dent body representative to three
special study committees to provide
him with an analysis of how such an
exchange program might be imple-
mented at Washington and Lee.

One committee is studying financial
matters under the chairmanship of
Treasurer James W. Whitehead, as-
sisted by Dr. Jay D. Cook and Dr.
Charles F. Phillips, Jr.

Curricular matters are being stud-
ied by Associate Dean of the College
William J. Watt with assistance from
Dr. John F. DeVogt and Dr. H.
Marshall Jarrett.

Associate Dean of Students Lewis
G. John heads a group investigating
student affairs implications of the ex-
| change. Others on this committee in-
; clude senior Rob Bauer of Largo,
Fla., Dr. Louis W. Hodges, and Dr.
Thomas C. Imeson.

University Explores Possibility
Of Seven College Exchange

Huntley and assisting him in prepara-
tion for the March 11 discussions.

In outlining the committees’ as-
signments, President Huntley em-
phasized that study of the exchange
program and its possible implementa-
tion by September, 1970, does not
preclude further study that could lead
to additional exchange arangements
with one or more members of the
eight-college group. And he said that
Washington and Lee's participation in
such exchange programs does not
necessarily preclude the possibility of
future general coeducation at the Uni-
versity.

person under the new Honor System
recommendations.

The accused, Passavant said, will
be allowed two hours, not 24, be-
tween a precise statement of the ac-
cusation and the beginning of the
Honor Trial. Steve Sandler, who had
supported the 24-hour clause, ac-
cepted the revision with the provision
that the student body president may,
at his discretion, extend the period
to 24 hours “for good reason.”

According to Passavant, the time
extensions was recommended to allow
the accused to compose himself and
collect his thoughts and therefore ex-
cept under special circumstances, if
was felt that two hours was sufficient.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Admissions: A Talk With The Dean

(Editor’s Note: The following interview
consists of excerpts from a conversation the
Friday Ring-tum Phi had with Dean Far-
rar on February 25. We wish to thank
Dean Farrar for his time and considera-
tion in order that this interview could be
possible. )

Ring-tum Phi—To begin with, Dean Farrar,
what do you think the basic problems are for
our Board of Admissions at this point?

is now male, I can’t say. I’ve spent all fall ®

and winter trying to determine this. Some
of the colleges say that the evidence is over-
whemling that young people prefer a coeduca-
tional institution. The evidence I’ve found
does not indicate that it is overwhelming.

But what effect this will have on the future
of recruiting, I can’t say. It’s bound to have
some effect if this trend is continuing. We
may get some indication on the number of

New Trends in Admissions

(Editor’s Note: The figures shown be-
low are a comparison between the number
of students going to college nationwide and
the number that have applied to Washing-
ton and Lee for admissions. Also of note
is the percentage of students in the nation

going to public and private institutions of
higher learning, as compared with the num-
ber of applicants to W&L. All figures
shown beyond 1968 are projections pre-
pared by the College Entrance Examina-

tion Board and the Office of H.E.W.)

group will be going to public institutions. And
this springs from economics as a college-going
factor. So this is number one.

WeL is basically a rich man’s school.
Whether or not we like it, it is. The expense
to come here, the environment here, your
social needs, the traveling to the girl’s schools,
etc. So, there are three really major con-
cerns, it seems to me, as it reflects recruting
of students for the private institution. One,
the economic factor. Another factor, the large
multi-service university. Its proliferation of
curricula, greater opportunities for the man
to move into that environment and specialize
ina part ular area.

Then, thirdly, the co-ed move. I'm sure
you realize that Yale and Princeton and
Harvard have already made this move. And
l'rinity, which is close to us in size and their
fraternity system is going co-ed. Then Frank-
lin and Marshall, Wesleyan, Sewanee, Col-
gate, and several others. Kingman Brewster
started this and I think perhaps panicked the
others.

Colleges seem to list two major reasons.
The coeducation factor, if you're totally di-
verse. Then you have the reason that col-
leges are really hard pressed for top students.
Princeton frankly said that they felt they
weren't getting their share of good students
and if the trend was to co-ed, then they
wanted to do it. Not only to get the top
female students, but the top male students
as well who felt that coeducation is beneficial.

This is definitely coming on fast. To what
degree this is a factor and what impact it has
or will have on Washingtor and Lee which

f

 

visit which, until this year, has been limited.
This year, Dean John’s travel, my travel, and
now a third member, Dean Schildt, who is
an assistant director of admissions, is greatly
increased.

R-t Phi—lIs this a permanent position?
Farrar—Oh, yes—and I hope permanently
would mean forever! So, we now have, in
effect, three people with certain limitations
on time—Dean John’s teaching and financial
aid, which is a full-time job. We really have
two full-time admissions people and this year,
for instance we were able to double our travel
to guidance counselors and to people.

 

A present, urgent need is another member,
and we're investigating this. There are lots of
possibilities for that—he might be a recent
graduate who would spend one or two years
here, primarily on the road. Although this
year has been a definite improvement, it’s
still sub-par.

Let’s talk about this in relation to the under-
priviledged man from the disadvantaged eco-
nomic and social circumstances. You have
to seek these people out——you have to go to
the guidance people and say that we're in-
terested in them. Then you go to the man
and say that we're interested in them. Then
you go to the man and say that we're private
and expensive but, we can help everyone we
offer admissions to, unfortunately, the kind
of aid we offer is basically scholarship grant
and loan, which is a pretty unattractive pack-
age particularly for the disadvantaged child—
black or white.

R-t Phi—What are the chances that the new

ee

member of the admissions office will be
Negro?

Farrar—There is no reason why a Negro
couldn’t join the staff. But I don’t feel we
need a Negro in the admissions office just
to show perspective Negro and underprivileg-
ed high school students we want them to come
to W&L. We are now going out of our way
to get them interested in W&L.

What we have to do is not only tell them
about the outstanding educational opportuni-
ties here, but that we can help. Here, you
come to the primary need as far as admissions
is concerned, a greatly increased program of
student financial aid for the man who has
total need. For the man who borrows over
50 per cent of his money here over four
years, that adds up to a large sum of money
more than the government allows. What we
need to do is to be able to offer to these
men a significantly larger amount of grant

 

assistance,

I think it’s important that any college
particularly a private college—has to make
itself available to students who can do the
work. This is my paramount, number one
concern.

R-t Phi—Where can we get these grants
from? From alumni or what?
Farrar—From alumni, from parents, from

people who are concerned with the private
institution. As it affects recruiting, it is a
particular need as it pertains to our strength-
ening and going out and making this institu-
tion available to all youngsters. My concern
is that now we have a disproportionately
not that the lending
but I think it should

be a smallet portion, This is where vou hurt

high amount of loans
principle is not sound

in getting students, because they look to the
large university for its smaller expenses and
larger proportions of grants available.
Another problem is that you're talking to
a miniscule number of people that are qualified
to do the work. Add to that fact that you're
competing with other universities for this
small percentage, and you ve got a problem
on your hands
Ra Phi

able to utilize more of our resources here.

Don't vou think that we might be

such as organizing student groups a5 well as
alumni to go out and recruit?
Farrar As far as students recruiting, we
have tried it. But what you run into when
you get with the students is the problem ot
travel from here students cant leave the
school because of their classroom commit
ments

Then, as far as direct school visits go, we
have slumni in sevet al ifeas who yet peopl
interested in the school, and I think we can

increase this But the school guidance ofhics

Is interested in seeing some representative
from the admissions office. They want to talk
detail—they’re happy to see alumni and stu-
dents, but they can’t tell them what they
need to know.

R-t Phi—But isn’t the problem getting the
interest of the students in high school?
Farrar—Yes, I quite agree. But I can’t see
where it can be done feasibly and well. I’m
not saying it can’t be done. Certainly, the
more you visit, the more people you send,
the better chance you have of the schools’
remembering you. It’s sort of like market-
ing—the more you put your product on the
shelf, the more people will remember it. Vil
say it’s hard to work—-but I do think we can
increase the use of alumni more as a means
of identification.

R-t Phi—Who would be able to organize more

 

alumni groups in order that our name might

be known more than it is now?
Farrar—Well, in the cities, we'd need to work
with the president of an alumni group to get
a person who's interested in doing this kind
of work He would be the liason with the
alumni group and would have three or four
men helping him.

Rt Phi So with all thie ‘ probl ms in mind,

A Not-So-Rash Statement

Washington and Lee University must be-
come a coeducational institution within the
next few years if it is to retain its identity as
a ranking academic college.

Now, before anyone yells at us for mak-
ing such a rash statement, allow us to ex-
plain three reasons for this.

First of all, we believe women are beneficial
elements in the classroom. Many students at
WeL say they would not be as candid in
class if women were present. They believe
women would be distracting and would de-
tract from the informality of class. According
to professors who have taught at coed schools,
nothing could be farther from the truth. These
professors say that in classes with women,
discussions are more lively and perceptive. It
is as if the women are in direct competition
with the men and wish to show them up. At
the same time, the feminine point of view
can be highly enlightening in many subjects.
(These same professors also note that apathy
inside and outside of the classrooms of coed
schools is at a minimum.)

A second reason for going coeducational
is so the university can survive financially as
a high academic school. As the table of
statistics on page 2 indicates, fewer and fewer
students are electing to go to private colleges
and universities. The trend for the future
shows this will not change. As Dean of Ad-
missions, James D. Farrar, pointed out in the
interview, the main reason for this is eco-
nomics.

The question is, “How can W&L attract
the declining percentages of students who
want to attend private colleges, and, at the
same time, combat the rising costs of attend-
ing a private college?”

The first answer to this question would be
to accept more students into the freshman
class. This may slow the rising tuition costs
since the increased revenues from the enlarg-
ed student body may offset increasing ex-
penses. This has been done at W&L (W&L’s
entering class of 1965 was 346, In 1968 it
was 362.) and still the tuition rises every year.
In fact, the Self-Study Report of 1964-66
states, “". . . the University could not now, or
probably in the immediate future, significantly
increase the size of its freshman class and
maintain the same general academic caliber
of recent entering classes.”

Another solution might be to increase h-
nancial aid programs to students to reduce
their expenses while attending Washington
and Lee. This is a dire necessity, as stated in
the Self-Study Report: “Without an adequate
program, less qualified students must be ac-
cepted for admission because funds are not
available for those better qualified applicants
who simply cannot pay the cost of an under-

Red Front Gro.

graduate education. The quality of the student
body and the standards of the University are
thus raised by the financial aid program; a
greater diversity of student, social, economic,
ethnic, and geographic backgrounds also is
made possible.”

At this time, as pointed out by Dean Farrar,
the University’s financial aid program is in-
adequate. Whereas W&L has made great
progress in its program of financial aid to
needy students in recent years (financial as-
sistance rose from $148,419 awarded to 19.5
per cent of the student body in 1960-61 to
approximately $400,00 awarded to 22 per
cent of the student body in 1968-69), it
still falls short of making this school avail-
able to all qualified students, regardless of
financial circumstances. Even if resources
were obtained to aid students here, the ex-
pense of the social environment would con-
tinue to make the school prohibitive to many
prospective students.

The point we are trying to make is that
W&L is hurting itself by restricting its student
body to just men, and rich ones at that. By

expanding the student body to include wo-

men, part of this problem could be solved
since we would be drawing from all of those
men and women interested in attending pri-
vate schools,

The third reason Washington and Lee
should become coeducational is to raise its aca-
demic standards. An indication of the decreas-
ing excellence here is evidenced by the aver-
age verbal scores of the Scholastic Aptitude
Tests. These scores, though not absolute in-
dicators, are the best means for predicting a
prospective student’s college grades. In 1965
the mean verbal score was 608. (The mean
math score was 643.) In 1968 the entering
class’s verbal mean was 582. (The mean math
score was 616.)

Thus, a condition exists in which W&L
is accepting more and more students each
year from a diminishing number of appli-
cants and ending up with less strong aca-
demic qualifications as reflected by scores.

The way to end these diminishing standards
is to recognize, as did Princeton, that we are
not getting our share of good students. By
becoming coed, W&L will place itself in a
position to get not only the top male students,
but also the top female students.

For these three reasons, we believe W&L
should now think seriously about coeducation.
The main argument we hear against this move
is that W&L will “lose its identity” as a small,
highly academic, men’s school. However we
strongly feel the University will lose its ident-

ity if it submits itself to being satisfied with ac- |

cepting students of lower academic excellence
just because it refuses to go coeducational.

On Becoming Aware

Of “The Other Side”

To the editor of the Friday
Ring-tum Phi:

It is indeed encouraging to see the
Friday edition of the Ring-tum Phi
take a stand where it is needed, To
grow as human beings we must see
and try to feel conditions on “the
other side’—not only in Lexington,
but everywhere.

Let me also say: there is no reason
that misery should be the price of
artistic accomplishment, but when-
ever misery is the price, our choice
should be clear. There are already
too many reasons for justifying our
apathy and our unconcern, Let us
not add art to this dreary list.

Sincerely,
Westbrook Barritt,
Professor of Romance Languages

 

Dear Sir:

My congratulations on your ex-
cellent article, “The Other Side of
Lexington.” Prerequisite to solving
the very real social and economic
problems of Lexington which you
point out is becoming aware of them.
rhis is something | fear few Wash-
ington and Lee students and faculty
accomplish,

1 would hope most readers con-

they represent America’s “cultural
clite.” What they do represent is an
intelligent, economically well off
segment of American society which
enjoys a good life—a good life from
which a sizable segment of America
is barred by virtue of color and/or
lack of means.

In the final analysis then, maybe
this is all the original essay meant to
contend. Washington and Lee “gentle-
men” should indeed realize how for-
tunate they are, at the minimum
should appreciate it, and better yet
might even be inclined to help as-
sure “the other side of Lexington”
an equal chance at the good life
they enjoy.

Phys. Ed. Is Important

This letter is intended to take the
opposite point of view from the one
stated in the February 21 edition of
the Friday Ring-tum Phi calling for
the end of P.E. at W&L.

I take exception to Mr. Maneval’s
statement that there is not a mind
among the “sound-body” people of
the gym. I consider this an insult
to our P.E. instructors who are mem-
bers of this faculty and deserve to
be respected as such. The minds of
these gentlemen are just as sound as
their bodies.

I don't think P.E. students are
reduced to the status of forced labor-
ers as Mr. Maneval claims. All the
P.E. department asks of the student

    

is to come to class and participate.
What's so hard about that?

I disagree that sports such as soccer
and tumbling are completely useless.
They help the student get in shape
to a certain extent. Mr, Maneval fails
to mention the emphasis placed on
running in P.E. class. There is no
better conditioner,

Mr. Maneval states that one can
easily pick up sports like golf and
bowling if he has the interest. Often,
I think, it takes a P.E. program to
instill the interest. | know that P.EB.
class has interested many students in
handball, a sport they knew nothing
about before coming to W&L.

Mr, Maneval asks, “what affect does
P.E. have upon a student in his
academic work?” My answer is that
it helps academic work. The more
physically fit a person is, the more
mentally fit he is. If a person is in
good shape physically, he is better
able to cope with his academic and
personal problems. I realize I'm bas-
ing my answer on personal experience
rather than scientific proof, but 1
think many people would agree with
me.

Mr. Maneval is wrong in think-
ing that the athletic interests of the
W&L student range from none to
moderate. Many students are highly
interested in athletics both as partici-
pants and spectators.

Mr. Maneval may be interested in
knowing that some of the people
whom he would consider our “sound-
mind” men practice physical fitness.
These gentlemen may be seen play-
ing handball or running around the
track in Doremus on weekdays at
the noon hour,

KENNETH BEER’S exhibit of novel artistic structures, now on display in
duPont Hall, includes this horse and rider, Mr. Beer teaches art at Madison

Abstract Sculptor Kenneth Beer
Currently Exhibiting In duPont

By LEX McMILLAN

Even the most unobservant student
who happens to enter duPont Hall
this week will notice some very eye-
catching structures in the exhibition
room. Now being shown col-
lection of the works of Kenneth Beer,
a creator of thought provoking pieces
ol sculpture.

Mr. Beer is now a teacher of art
at Madison College in Harrisonburg.
He has been working there since
1962. He is married, around 35 years

is a

old and has three children. Out of
this apparently very usual family
structure comes some very unusual

artistic structures. Prior to coming to
Madison Mr. Beer worked in Detroit
as a Styling Engineer and did con-
siderable work on the design of the

Stringray. He also worked in dif-
ferent private art institutions in
Detroit.

His works vary in size and even
more in price. The smallest object

displayed is about one foot and con-
trasis to the largest which is about

An Editorial

 

The position of athletics today at
Washington and Lee seems to be
precarious, Since our football scand-
als of the 'S0’s, we have seen a
de-emphasis on athletics—-a de-em-
phasis which has been much greater
than expected,

Coaches, too, are disturbed about
this because it has reached the point
where athletics have become an ob-
ject of student apathy. Without
scholarships we cannot hope to get
the quality of players we once had.
But with an atmosphere surrounding
athletics such as we have here, it
gets even more difficult to woo good
players of any kind,

The students are not the only ones
who are guilty of this apathy, how-
ever. Many faculty members discour-
age students from participating in
athletics, feeling it takes away from
study time. Some will not make al-
lowances for students’ academic work
when they leave on athletic trips.

University has grown immensely, to

director, has done an excellent job
with what he has to work,

Finances are too stringent, and this
may be the cause of other mal-
functions. For example, coaches are
not subsidized when they want to go
to a national conference. This also
contributes to dissatisfaction among
the coaches, along with the lack of
equipment, facilities and the like. The
new gym will help to alleviate at least
some of these problems if no further
financial restrictions are imposed
along with it.

Another field that needs improve-
ment is the University Committee on
Inter-Collegiate Athletics. According
to a two-year student member of the
committee, it has done nothing in
the past two years except to pass on
monogram winners,

There are other things that should
be reviewed, such as the number of
hours allowed to teams for travel.
Revisions should be made in the
method of determining these hours.
At present a team is given a certain
‘number of study hours that it can

Thursday night’s faculty basketball} real cliff-hanger), as the Animals won

game with the Phi Psi’s was an un-
welcome change from farcical play
of the previous week. This was the
third game the faculty has played.
On Tuesday night the “game of
the year” pitted the Phi Delt “Ani-
mals” against the Faculty “Has-Beens”
in their second outing. The game
turned out to be simply a difference
of age and strength. The faculty,
plagued with sickness and_ injuries,

This seemed to be a repeat per-

the referee (again none other than
Chuck Freret) ruled that the shot
was after the buzzer, and the Phi

Kap’s were judged the winners.
Coach Jim Loesel of the Faculty
seems to be generally pleased with
the quality of play, especially among
his “Has-Beens.” Of great help have
been “Wrong-Way” Joe Lyles and

pensive piece is recognizable as a
horse and rider but is endowed with
some accessories which make it a
little more than just that. This horse
and rider work is quite large and is
one of Mr. Beer’s early works.

An awareness of the different
work’s chronological order shows an
interesting progression in the style of
the artist. Even casual observers can
see a marked difference in style in the
works. In talking with Mr. David
Hall of the art department one finds
that Mr. Beer's works have grown
continually more abstract.

The old question of: “What it is?”
is really not applicable to his later
works. Much of his material is just
odds and ends from junk yards. His
inspiration comes greatly from those
very pieces of junk. He creates his
ari mainly for the enjoyment of
blending entirely dissimilar objects
into a balanced “thing.”

Mr. Hall explained that the move
today toward the abstract can be
said to be tracable simply to the joy
of shapes and forms. There is a
stigma on visual arts that has re-
quired them to be a representation or
copy of something. The move toward
abstraction is parralleled to music.
Music is not required to be anything
more than just what it is and
appreciated for its aesthetic value.

The work of Kenneth Beer are en-

talent we need.

One area that does hurt our athletic
program is finances. As a private uni-
versity, we do not enjoy the luxury
of unlimited funds, but, it seems that
there should be more money made
available to the athletic department.
Many students complain that not
enough athletic equipment is made
available to them or their teams. We
wish to say that the equipment we
do have must be guarded closely
because it is financially hard to re-
place. Coach Miller, as

Following strong showings in ping
pong and handball, Sigma Phi Epsilon
has taken the lead in the WA&L
intramural program. With a total of
654, SPE has a slim 13 point lead
over Phi Kappa Sigma.

Next in line is Sigma Nu with 614
points, followed by ZBI with 581,
Sigma Chi at 575, the Betas with 572,
the Delts with 570, Pi Phi at 537,

For the past several weeks, the
Executive Committee has been con-
sidering numerous proposed changes
in your Honor System. The various
proposals lie within both the pro-
cedural and jurisdictional categories
of the system. These changes, if im-
plemented, will make the Honor Sys-
tem at Washington and Lee con
siderably easier for the Executive
Committee and the Student Body to
administer, while at the same time
providing for increased protection for
the accused student, The Executive
Committee feels that it is absolutely
essential for the Student Body to be
entirely cognizant of the proposed
changes. In addition, student partici-
pation in discussing these changes is
strongly encouraged by the E.C.

To date, the sub-committees
on the Honor System have given their
reports, and plans are for the
future. The Procedure
(Hendricks and Passavant) report
appears in its entirity in the March
4th Ring-tum Phi with the modifica-
tions added by the E.C. as a whole
appearing in heavy black ink

“America Hurrah” can be described
as “unique” and “extremely contro- |
versial.” A satire of American life,
the play will run March 12-15; the
curtain will rise at 8:30,

Ihe play's composition is unique |
} in that it is a series of one-act plays
united by a central theme. The con- |
troversial theme treats the degenera-|

tion of American culture through
three established institutions. The |
|three one-acts entitled “Interview,” |

unfairness of big business, the waste-
land of American entertainment, and

term,

tables proposals on honor

In the belief that some sort of short
term program is desirable for Wash-
ington and Lee, the Executive Com-
mittee on a motion by Steve Sandler
endorsed the Curriculum Committee's
proposal presented by Swede Henberg
that either arrangement (12-6-12 or
12-12-6) is preferable to the present
university calendar. Although one
plan is not at this moment held in
preference to the other, it should be
understood that the Executive Com-
mittee may, at some future time,
endorse a more specific recommenda-
tion concerning the current curri-
culum proposal. The endorsement
was unanimous with Secretary Judson
Simmons absent.

Joe Tompkins introduced — three
recommendations drafted by himself
and Dean Kumpuris concerning the
co-op and the student union. The EC
unanimously approved these recom-
mendations (discussed on page two
in this paper in an article by
lompkins) which basically deal with
co-op hours, student union jobs, and
a committee of inquiry to study co-
op pricing policies, food, ete.

Danny Leonard, chairman of the
Subcommittee on the Jurisdiction of
the Honor System, read the report
of this group which was debated at
considerable length. The _ report
basically consists of two proposals:
1) The scope of the Honor System
shall include all instances of lying,
cheating, and stealing by a person
assumed to be student at Wash-
ington and Lee. In such instances,

the motives of the accused shall be

Collins refused to come to

she “just didn’t want to.” She had
no apparent engagements scheduled
for that date, and a sufficient fee was
offered her, but, as board vice-presi-
dent Dean Kumpuris stated, she still!
did not want to come to WAL.

Kumpuris went on to say that it|
is now too late to schedule any good
entertainment for that date and that
the Board refused to settle for any-
one below the quality of the popular
female vocalist.

The Finals concert will once again
be reinstated to its previous date in
May, so as to give the Board sufficient
time to book a good group. It is
hoped that next year another attempt |
rescheduling this event will be
made and will not be destroyed by
such abrupt action as that of Miss

REVIEW and OUTLOOK
The return of Saturday classes

It could happen.

Soon.

Sentiment is growing among the faculty to re-institute
Saturday classes—not next year, but this year (it could be
effected during Spring Vacation). To most students it should
be surprising that such a move is being considered; but to
the hundred or so who have flagrantly and frequently abused
this favor granted by the faculty, it must seem quite the logical
conclusion.

And after all, the faculty actually was doing the students
a favor. When all the hogwash (in most cases) about “extra
time for research and study” is peeled away, the basic reason
for not having Saturday classes is convenience. By now, it’s
become a different and pleasant way of life.

To most. But not to those professors who teach on Friday
afternoons, not to the visiting lecturers greeted with empty
classrooms, not to the athletic coaches who face diminishing
Friday afternoon practice sessions.

The ace in the hole we as students held in bargaining for
the end of Saturday classes was that no one actually knew
how we would handle Fridays. The faculty has called our bluff,
and unless we can visibly and promptly demonstrate enough
willingness to accept the responsibility, the loss may be ours.

On eating two crows

One would think the editor of the college paper could
report with more accuracy than did this one at last week’s
Executive Committee meeting. We offer the EC our apologies
for having mistakenly reported that a student accused of an
honor violation will be given notice twenty-four hours before-
hand (it’s actually two hours’ notice).

# x

Now for the next crow. Garnishing all such repasts are
apologies, and this time they go to Staman Ogilvie. It hurts
to say this, but he did more research than we did, and his
exam proposal is more feasible than ours.

We objected to his plan on the grounds of its complexity
and time-consuming preparations. But as Mr. Ogilvie proved,
the faculty Committee on Courses and Degrees is adamant
(or even worried) about including all possible safeguards for
the students. Even though we disagree with their reasoning,
we can understand it, and we will join Mr. Ogilvie in trying
to obtain revision of the existing examination schedule.

To the Trustees

The editorial in last Friday’s edition concerning admissions
was extremely well taken, as few ever realized the numerous
problems which are faced by a small liberal arts college such
as ours is. But one situation has been seriously overlooked, one
vitally connected with admissions, and that is public relations.

The Self-Study Report of 1966 characterizes public rela-
tions as that “which covers every area of what Washington
and Lee is, what it does, and what it needs.” And, as it also
states, it influences the type of student who applies here, thus
precipitating a relationship between public relations and ad-
missions.

W&L has a very critical need for building up its public
image to make people more aware of its existence. By this we
could attract greater interest and receive a greater number of
applicants, as well as personal endowments. The world will
not wait to hear about us, rather we must let ourselves be heard
and known through public expression.

Within our own closed circles we are extremely competent:
both our Alumni and University magazines express excellently
that which is Washington and Lee. But it is not within this
confined area that we are speaking. We are concerned with the
manner in which the image of W&L is presented to the public
through media which circulates far beyond the captive audience
of parents and alumni.

As presently existing, the only outstanding external man-
ner of publicity is carried on by our Office of Information
Services and consists of little more than trivial news releases
which seldom reach the public eye. We seem to have become
bogged down in this rather ineffective type of public expres-
sion and have lost sight of the purpose of public relations.

We should attempt in the future to limit ourselves in the
great number of insignificant releases which we send out and
concentrate on just having a smaller amount of more relevant
and more interesting news material, This obviously has a greater
chance of making it into a newspaper than much of the news

an intelligible form, such that they would not require extensive
rewriting or revision, the opportunity for their being trans-
ferred to the printed word would be increased even more.

In these times, when the competition for applicants and
grants for small colleges is so greatly rising, we must realize
that an effective campaign must be conducted to obtain the
interest of the public. If we must, we should employ a pro-
fessional organization dealing with public relations to advise
and perhaps to conduct temporarily our methods of publicity,
so that we will be able to promote our image to the fullest.
It could show us the necessary steps to be taken or aid us in
improving our present manner.

Washington and Lee indeed deserves to receive greater
public exposure, for it is a unique school in which tradition is
harmoniously juxtaposed with change. We are worthy of gain-
ing more applicants and more private grants, and the most
effective way in which to obtain these ends is to promote our
image through viable public relations. —R.B.B.

By JOE TOMPKINS
Sophomore EC Representative
During the past month, Dean Kum-

puris and I have conducted a study
of the policies and operation of the
Co-op. Our study is by no means
complete but we feel that it is im-
portant at this time to give a brief
summary of our findings and make
several recommendations to be acted
upon immediately, We recommend
the following:

1, The Co-op should be open from
8-12 p.m., Monday thru Friday; it
should also be open from 10-2 p.m,
Saturday and from 7:30-10:30 p.m.
Sunday.

2. A Committee of Inquiry should
be set up, consisting of two members
of the E.C., Dean Kumpuris and
Joe Tompkins, and several members
of the administration.

3. When the Student Union opens,
first preference for jobs should be
given to interested students.

Our study was primarily prompted
by an academic concern which was
brought to our attention by a mem-
ber of the faculty. With the institution
of the five-day week it became in-
creasingly noticeable that there was
a tendency for students to leave
campus every Friday after classes
and not return until the following
Monday. In short, there was no in-
centive for a student to return to the
campus to study and work during
the weekend, particularly Friday and
Sunday nights. Also, during the week

 

R-t P Memorabilia contest
entries are near deadline

Soon The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
will publish its First Annual Me-
morabilia Issue, consisting almost en-
tirely of photographs and poetry. The
specific date of publication has yet
to be decided in order to obtain as
large a selection of pictures and
poetry as possible. All sorts of photo-
graphs are now being solicited by the
editor, as well as poetry from indi-
viduals or groups. Photo credits will
be given, of course, to all pictures
used. In addition, The Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi will provide two $10 awards.
One going to the single person or
group submitting the best group of
exemplary pictures, and the other
award going to the best poetic entry.

Due to the less than overwhelm-
ing number of entries to date, the
deadline has been extended until Fri-
day, March 21. No entries after that
date can be considered and the
decisions of the editors wil be final.
Please leave all photos and poems in

ington.

there was no place for students to
get a cup of coffee or food after
10:30 p.m. Longer hours in the Co-op
seem to offer a possible solution to
this problem and this is the basis
for our first recommendation. We
feel that this recommendation war-
rants immediate action.

However, our long-range attention
should be given to the last two recom-
mendations, both of which evolved
from the first. Whereas the first is a
result of an academic concern, the
second and third are basically
financial concerns. The purpose of our
Committee of Inquiry is not to make
trouble or to cause any undue hard-
ships. We merely want to make sure
that the students of this university are
getting the best deal possible and are
being treated fairly. We plan to study
the prices of textbooks, supplies, and
other items, by comparing them with
the prices and policies of similar
Operations at other colleges and uni-
versities. Hopefully, the outcome of

 

E.C. urges Co-op changes

this inquiry will be a more efficient
and a more beneficial Co-op,

The third recommendation — is
mainly concerned with the priority
of job assignments in the new Student
Union. From the response we re-
ceived from our inquiry about student
interest in working in the Co-op it is
obvious that a substantial number of
students would like to work part-time
on campus. Although it appears to
be rather unfeasible to ask that these
students be employed in the Co-op
at the present time, it is only fair
that interested students be given first
preference for jobs in the Student
Union.

These three recommendations are
a start, but as I stated before, our
study of the Co-op is not finished,
for many more questions need to be
answered. These answers will be pre-
sented to you as they are revealed to
us, but if you have any suggestions
or specific inquiries contact Dean or
me.

 

Van Itallie’s ‘America Hurrah’ to

startle W&L audiences this week

Sometimes this school does a really
exciting thing. One of them is the
production of “America Hurrah” by
Jean-Claude van Itallie, beginning
Wednesday at the Troubadour
Theater. A more startling and in-
vigorating play could hardly be chosen
nowadays—and at W&L, notice.

The play springs from a definite
time and place. It could not have
been written before the Vietnam war
demonstrated the helplessness of
American optimism. It could not have
been produced before the evolution
of so-called off-off-Broadway theater.

Off-off-Broadway is a marriage of
radical theatrical atmosphere with
radical theatrical location. Its crea-
tors feel that their plays matter more
than their professional images. The
typical off-off-Broadway theater is a
room in a church or basement.
“America Hurrah” opened in 1966
at the cramped tiny, please-don't-ex-
hale-you'll-bother-the-actors — Pocket
Theater—only slightly larger than the
Troubadour.

Van Itallie and others make up
for lack of equipment with imagina-
tion, “America Hurrah”—three one-
act plays—stretches and reshapes the
theatrical space. Identities switch;

 

actors turn into machines or pieces
of furniture; in the third part a room
becomes an actor. Characters leave a
television screen and mix with their
viewers. Familiar sights become extra-
ordinary: a television personality ends
| her show endlessly, a politician has

 

exactly the right words to say nothing
at all.

Van Itallie uses his theatrical free-
dom to create an astonishng set of
images for _ this-land-we-know-and-
love. In “Interview,” the business of
applying for jobs conceals despera-
tion and pain. “Television” demon-
strates the danger of unconsciously
accepting a culture. And in “Motel,”
a grotesque and overpowering situa-
tion shows about as much about
America as can be shown in a
play.

Since it opened in
“America Hurrah” has enjoyed
enormous success, It strikes a re-
sponsive chord. Audiences sense that
Van Itallie’s honesty must replace the
typically American search for ideals,
One tends to think of the American
Dream as a lovely picture, but Van
Itallie points to the underside of the
dream. Our ignorance leads to viol-
ence, as recent events everywhere
demonstrate. The final image in
“America Hurrah” is one of over-
whelming violence.

A university ought to encourage
education, even though it often
doesn't. The Troubadour Theater
normally picks adventurous plays. It
is certainly doing its part with this
one, at exactly the right moment.
The play encourages the bravery need-
ed nowadays to want to be educated.
See this play for reinvigorations: if
nothing follows, it will not be the
theater's fault. —Kirk Woodward

But he suggested there's more: a
gentleman greets his fellows when
they meet. He dos this not only out

cern and care for his fellow man
and respect for who and what his
companions are.

And speaking of companions, I
descended from Mt. Olympus and had
a pleasant conversation with a fresh-
man last week before leaving for
Atlanta. He maintained that from the
earliest time in the life of a fresh-
man his individuality is denied. He
explained to me slowly, as one might
to a retarded child or a Republican
that freshmen are forced to dress like
the herd and then by the questionable
virtue of a name tag are singled out
for a certain discrimination in second
class citizenship.

Mr. Goodwin then explained the
difficulty of establishing a distinct
personality for an academic com-

munity of ten or more thousand. Then
he concerned himself with you and
me.

Therefore we might suggest that
the value denied by these fellow
workers is not conformity (since these
boys uniformly dress without ties or
socks or bathing and are covered by
an ultraemasculine growth of peach-
fuzz resplendant) but rather that that
value denied is but the end objective:
gentlemantliness and community. Wal-

this aspect of our society “the decline

Letters
To the Editor

Courtesy is appreciated
Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

I would like to express my ap-
preciation to the students of Wash-
ington and Lee University for the
courtesy extended to me during my
recent recruiting visit.

Although some students may have
resented my presence on the campus,
they did respect the rights of their
fellow students and did not interfere
with those who expressed an interest
in the officer programs of the U. S.
Marine Corps.

This reflects favorably upon the
students of Washington and Lee and
is appreciated by me.

Don’t withhold signatures

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:
Your publication last week of the

unsigned rebuke of the Friday Phi's

spread on housing in Lexington
prompts me to write.

My most immediate concern is not
with the contents of the letter itself.
The letter reflects such incomprehen-
sible naivete as to render debate im-
possible the author has of course,
committed no wrong. His product was
neither right nor wrong, only in-
nocent. For this reason a reply to
the substance of the piece is im-
possible.

While no response to content is
possible, in my opinion it is both
possible and desirable to say a thing
or two about the nature of the letter
and about the fact that it was pub-
lished unsigned. It was essentially a
homiletical piece stating an opinion,
not arguing a case. Homilies rarely
lend themselves to critical debate, but
when the homelitician is known one
can respond to him if not to his
ideas. For example, one might suggest
to him a reading list or mention to
him the fact of mutual dependence
of all classes.

lt is, therefore, the fact that the
writer of this letter was not made
known to your readers which prompts
my reply. Moreover, I fail to see
the purpose of publishing material
of this kind from outside the Uni-
versity community. (1 am assuming
that Washington and Lee has neither
student nor faculty so innocent.)

Even when unsigned letters come
from people at the University | see
no reason for withholding the name
from the reading public. Adequate
reply can be made only when the
author is identified. Perhaps your
policy of withholding names at the
request of the writer should be re-
examined.

University of Pennsylvania.

You can, too.

Plan to enroll in the Evelyn Wood
Reading Dynamics classes being offered
now.

Our course, founded by Evelyn Wood,
a prominent educator, is the same one
President Kennedy recommended. The
same one congressmen, senators and
thousands of others have taken.

It’s the course that will at least triple
your reading efficiency. (What we mean
by efficiency is not just reading s
alone, but a combination of speed and
comprehension. )

How does the course work?

Reading Dynamics teaches your eyes
to work directly with your mind. You
take in whole groups of words, even sen-
tences and paragraphs at a glance. So
you get the total impact—just as you do
when seeing a picture for the first time.

The result? You'll end up reading 3,
5, even 10 times faster than before.

Even more important, you'll under-
stand and remember more of what you
read.

As a college student, it is self-evident
that you can reduce your homework time
substantially. It will also improve your
grades.

Once you take the course, you’re auto-
matically a lifetime member.

The program is offered at a reduced
tuition and all faculty, staff and students
are eligible to enroll.

So plan now to come to one of the free
orientation sessions. We'll explain the
course to you and answer any questions.
Naturally, there’s no obligation.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Take Full Advantage Of Resources The KRing-tum Phi

The best ambassadors that Washington and Lee (or any
university) has are its students and its faculty. These are the
people that prospective students look at most carefully before
they decide to apply here. Prospective students are intelligent
enough to realize that the students and faculty are the essence
of the University. With this in mind, it is evident that these
groups can be very influential in convincing high school stu-
dents to apply to and attend W&L.

But what have these two groups been doing for W&L’s
recruiting? Virtually nothing. With the number of applica-
tions being submitted to W&L falling in proportion to the
number of students interested in attending private colleges,
there is an immediate need for these two groups to aid the
admissions department and become actively involved in
recruiting.

The advantages of having students participate in this
endeavor are evident. There are many students from different
areas of the country which cannot possibly be covered by
our admissions department. These students could go back
to their high schools and meet with high school juniors who
show some interest in W&L. The W&L students would not
interview students, but would answer questions concerning
student academic and social life here. (This is done to a certain
extent now, but usually between friends.) W&L students
could also take with them copies of the University catalogue
to distribute around the high schools.

Besides raising the interest of the high school students, this
would also acquaint high school guidance counselors with
We&eL. Although we send out thousands of catalogues each year
to high schools, only a few guidance counselors know enough
about W&L to recommend us to prospective students.

The meetings between the W&L recruiters and the high
school students and guidance counselors may be set up during
activities periods, so as not to interfere with school work. In
addition, with the cooperation of alumni chapters in their locali-
ties, student recruiters may arrange informal gathering after
school hours. These gatherings might include prospective stu-
dents from other high schools in the area.

There is no reason why we cannot make use of our prestigi-
ous debating teams to stir up interest. We have learned of
high school debates put on by W&L which left the students
highly impressed. We have also learned that the debating team
has offered to put on other debates in high schools, but did
not because no one would make the proper arrangements.

In this recruiting process, we should also concentrate on
attracting underprivileged and black students here. W&L stu-
dents from certain economic and social backgrounds would
be more suitable to go into schools in ghetto and slum areas
than would well-dressed admissions officers. These students,
being able to communicate better with the underprivileged
and black high schoolers, could relate to them the advantages
of W&L and what the school has to offer in the form of
academic and financial aid. Ideally, the student recruiter would
be able to offer advice from his personal experience about

Welcome, Mock O. A. S.

The Friday Ring-tum Phi is proud to be associated with
the Model Inter-American Conference of the Organization
of American States session which convenes today, and we wel-
come all the delegates to Washington and Lee.

The fact that the Mock O.A.S. Session is meeting today
is, to many observers, a surprise. When the idea for this session
was first conceived by senior Jorge Estrada of Colombia, many
thought it was a good idea but doubted whether it would
ever get off the ground. Well, it has gotten off the ground.
And when the session adjourns tomorrow night, more than
75 W&L students (although many more could have partici-
pated) and 40 students from other universities will have par-
ticipated,

This is a real tribute to the organizers of the session, who
include Hank Graddy, John Motsinger, Pat Arey and Tom
Blanton. In addition, Political Science Instructor Jim Loesel
and Professor of History Leon Sensabaugh have provided
invaluable assistance.

We urge anyone who wants to learn more about the
politics of the Western Hemisphere to attend the O.A.S.
sessions on the second floor of McCormick Library. The ses-
sions are open to the public and promise to deal with interest-
ing and controversial issues.

ways an underprivileged student could pay for his education
here.

The point is that we must make enormous efforts to com-
municate with these underprivileged and black students to
show them they are wanted at W&L and that W&L will aid
them in any way possible. We must go to them; they won’t
come to us.

These unofficial student recruiters will work on a voluntary
basis (through some exceptions may be made to help finance
certain trips) during vacation periods. In this way, classes and
studies will not be interrupted. In the end, the main purpose
of these students will be to encourage prospective applicants
to visit W&L to see the school and be interviewed (for un-
deprivileged students this trip might be financed by the Uni-
versity or the Executive Committee) .

Members of the faculty might operate in the same manner
as the students. Indeed, many members of the faculty, like
the students, haxe expressed a desire to help recruiting, but
have never been asked to. The faculty could also be used
to discuss important problems and questions parents might
have.

According to James D. Farrar, Director of Admissions,
a program similar to the one described above was attempted
seven years ago with no outstanding results. However, we
contend that a program carefully mapped out by the Office
of Admissions or by the Executive Committee (University of
Virginia’s student council has just set up a similar program)
will definitely increase the interest high school students have
in W&L. Let’s take full advantage of the resources available to
W&L and use them proudly and sensibly.

Request for Gold Bathtub

Dear Editor:
Reference is made to the article
of February 28th which called at-

tention to the slum area in Lexing-
ton. | was startled to learn that |
had been living in the slum for some
11 or i2 years now. I would like
to submit that | have been happy
living in the Lexington slum and so
far as | know there are others who
have been happy including the late
Chancellor of W&L.

But, since | am apparently one of
the slum dwellers, | wish to com-
ment on the letters of “Name With-
held” and Professor Hodges, It seems
to me that I might be considered
typical. Before attention was called
to my plight | had been unaware of
it and it did not disturb me. Now,
of course, | am ready for revolution
like any other of the “lower classes”
who have been stirred up by political
agitators. The main characteristic of
the reformer is that he dearly loves
to discover trouble where none existed
before. Now I propose to demand that

 

lthe “Federal government do some-
| thing.” In particular, they should re-

place my “slum” dwelling by a palatial
mansion and then make my landlord
‘rent it to me for the same price |
now pay. As a start, may I suggest
an inlaid gold bathtub? I never
i thought of having one before but the

Praise To School Board

Dear Editor:

| think it noteworthy and deserv-
ing of praise, if one considers the
decision February 20 of the Joint
Rockbridge-Lexington school board
to institute procedures to arrive at a
fair and equitable curriculum in their
schools. Too long has the black man
been denied the right to learn in
school of his American culture, which
is integral to every citizen’s culture
The school board voted unanimously
last night to work immediately to-
wards giving an adequate viewpoint
in education to the black man’s role
in society,

There was in Lexington, before
February 20’s meeting, some talk of
threats that a demonstration would
be held if the requests of the black
students weren't met. | was the one
who secured the permit from the
mayor to hold a demonstration. How-
ever, the demonstration was never
meant to be a threat or a lever to
anyone. We met the night before the
Board met and called off the demon-
stration, We meant for the demonstra-
tion to make people aware of the
problem, but the action became un-
necessary when the Board became
aware of the situation, Last night
they passed the proposed requests
of the black students after a lively
and open discussion that found us
all very much in accord. They did
not pass the requests out of fear
of a demonstration, but rather out
of belief that there was a problem
that must be solved and the proposals
were fair and valuable to the children
they serve. A great step forward has
been made.

2nd ‘Bitch-In’
May Emphasize

Honor Reforms

By JAY PASSAVANT

President of the Student Body

On Wednesday, March 19th, the
Student Body will have a special op-
portunity to voice its feelings about
the current status of the Honor Sys-
tem as it exists at Washington and
Lee. Many questions, which should be
of interest to all students, will be
raised concerning procedural and
jurisdictional policies now followed by
the E.C. and special attention will
be given to the proposed changes
which now confront the Executive
Committee

This “Bitch-In” will be conducted
ina manner similar to the previous
forum held last November, The Presi-
dent of the E.C. will briefly explain
the reasons why the proposed changes
and what they will
entail. After each point is made, any
student wishing to express view
point will be given the floor of the
meeting and his point will be spoken
to by a member of the E.C.

We realize that it is difficult’ for

Cole Field House in College Park,
Maryland was the scene of the first
round of the NCAA Eastern Regional
playoffs last night. It brought pretty
much what was expected as David-
son knocked off St. John’s and North
Carolina squeaked by a_ tenacious
Duquesne team which was tenth-rank-
ed in the nation,

Davidson combined its usual power
and finesse to easily whip St. John’s
79-69 in the opener last night. Be-
hind the shooting of 67° Mike Maloy,
who scored 35 points, Davidson never
gave up the lead, and Maloy was the
main reason for Davidson’s domina-
tion of the game,

St. John’s got into foul trouble
early trying to contain Maloy and

they were always in serious trouble
after that, and that cleared the way
for Maloy to attack the basket with
little Opposition.

Davidson jumped out to a 9-2 lead
at the start of the game, but Mike
Warren of St. John’s hit for 16
points in the first half to bring the
Redmen within one point of David-
son at the half

The second half opened with a
quick scoring spree in which Maloy

and Cooke combined to score ten
points to put Davidson ahead by 11
points with fifteen minutes remain-
ing.

Carolina

Second ranked North Carolina got
off to a rather shaky start in its game
with tenth ranked Duquesne last night
at the University of Maryland, host
to the NCAA Eastern Regional play-
offs. Both teams started out with
large number of turnovers and low
shooting percentages.

Duquesne played a slower brand
of ball than Carolina, and had heav-
ier men to beef up its already tough
defense under the boards. A pair of
6°10” twins, named Nelson, provided
both defense and scoring punch to
help Duquesne pull into the ball
game again in the 2nd half.

Mel Cartwright and
two of Washington and
indispensable players, have been
chosen for the 1969 Virginia All-
Small College basketball team.

Cartwright, a 6-5 junior, and Neer,
a 6-7 junior, make up part of the
altitudinous team’s front line, along
with Frank Allen of Roanoke. The
two gaurds chosen were Old Do-
minion’s Dick St. Clair and Randolph-
Macon’s Darrell Morris.

Cartwright was the high scorer dur-
ing W&L’s 18-5 season, scoring an
average of 19 points per game. Neer
averaged 18.4 points per game.

In all, the team is extremely strong
in all areas. It is endowed with scor-

Furthermore, both geographically
and physically, the “others are doing

“irrelevant.” There are four excel-

vicinity—within 50 miles, with a total
enrollment of about 3100. This can-
not be said for either Yale or for
Princeton. To go co-ed with the

However, just as long hair does not

our “irrelevant” tradition of courtesy,
be toned down. And the distractions
caused by the female presence would

Perhaps, finally, there are many
among us who see beyond the initial
novelty of coeduction a multitude of
problems and disadvantages. Dormi-
tory facilities are limited, and enroll-
ment is already at capacity, a prob-
lem discussed above. There are no
separate rest room facilities in many
campus buildings. What about recrea-
tion? A co-ed locker room? And this
only scratches the surface!

In a long-term development pro
gram, coeducation may indeed be in
our future. It is my feeling, however,
that, after considering the problems,
one cannot honestly advocate coedu

‘The way

I see it’

(Editor’s note: “The way I see it”
is a column of general editorial
comment for which contributions
are solicited from students and
faculty concerning any topic.)

By JOHN K. MOTSINGER
Mr. James Loesel, instructor in
Political Science, remarking on the
model OAS said something to this
effect. “This thing is really impressive.
It looks a whole lot better than it

really is.” He make a good point.
What was good, what was bad

 

about the conference? I don’t think
all of the answers are available to-
day. After a few weeks the glamour
will have worn off and delegates can
criticize this performance objectively.

 

Perhaps the most impressive part
of the conference is that it even oc-
curred. Washington and Lee has been
called an apathetic campus, yet the |
sessions were filled with delegates and
and observers who made the ses-
sions lively and interesting, but not
exactly “in character” with an Inter-
American Conference,

But, taken in the context of the
problems inherent in organizing such
a conference, I would have to rate
it a success. Model OAS’s are not
as common as Model Security Coun-
cils. Delegation chairmen had no
way of finding out actual policy from
most countries due to the poor pub-
lic relations of the embassies them-
selves.

As several delegates told me, the
embassies sent out maps, tourist in-
formation and promotional handbooks
for business men. This type of re-
action does not help the serious
student.

I do not mean to absolve myself

and the steering committee from fe-

oa. 04 ‘ . i re . the
sponsibility. We did not perform | ge le lt
perfectly. Our mistakes included | °"""* — =“

logistics and lack of communications,
and most of all, lack of adequate
knowledge of the problems that we
would encounter until they were al-
ready upon us.

Mistakes made this year can be
avoided in any future ventures of this
sort. 1 have asked several of the

delegates from other schools for criti-
cal evaluations, and would appreciate
the same from Washington and Lec |
participants and observers.

To stop now would be ill-advised. |
1 am optimistic enough to call for |
a group of interested students and
faculty to start making plans today
for a similar, but much more polish-
ed. conference to be held in the
spring of 1970, As we have built up
expertise in Mock Conventions, now
is our chance to perform a similar
feat (if not on such a grand scale)
in international relations.

Ihe Executive Committee in a
lengthy meeting Monday night voted
to accept five proposed amendments
to the student body constitution, Also
it gave its unanimous support to a
measure introduced by Jay Passavant
which called for the Faculty Execu-
tive Committee to extend Spring vaca-

Passavant’s proposal to add an
extra day to Spring vacation was
prompted by the fact that the present
schedule calls for the holiday to end
on Easter Sunday, April 6. Because
of the inconvenience of traveling on
Easter, he suggested that Monday
classes be dropped and that school
begin Tuesday, April 8. The extra
day could then be made up sometime
later in the year.

The disintegration of the party
system in W&L campus politics

First of two parts

By ROY CARLTON

Editorial-Page Editor
It is just about springtime at
WAL and soon the campus will be
littered with the usual campaign post-
ers. They'll all say the same thing,
and you'll wonder how many times
you've heard it before. Some students

LETTERS TQ THE COITOR

PSA’s purposes outlined

Recently some concerned students
formed an organization called the
Progressive Students’ Alliance. I wish
to define this group's purpose because
for some reason we have received
great criticism and mocking. The
group is a forum for discussion of
change and liberalism. Liberalism
implies that all ideas and suggestions
are welcome and will receive equal
consideration in meetings. Our meet-
ings are run very openly, with no
leader or single speaker, We have de-
cided not to have organization, as
elected officers, so that no one man’s
ideas are more influential than others.

Representatives of the PSA have
met with President Huntley three
times to date. Our meetings involved
discussion of all ideas brought up at
PSA meetings. Mr. Huntley's response
has been most encouraging. He has
consented to giving our organization
official representation in the Student
Handbook and we will send a speaker
to freshman camp.

It would take a much longer
article to state all ideas brought up
so far but briefly, some important
things are: (1). We sponsored a peti-
tion for the short term though student
interest was low. (2). We are form-
ing plans to sponsor a group of
speakers later in the spring. The
topics will include the black man in
America, the student movement on
college campuses in the U.S, and
the draft. G). We are investigating
the pay situation of WAL non-aca-
demic workers. (4). We are working
hand-in-hand with the administration
in setting up a free Co-ed University
on Saturdays with Hollins, (5). In
a drive to get Student Evaluation
Power of the Faculty we will work
to establish a student publication that
includes individuals’ evaluations of
teachers and their courses, (6). Dorm
regulations, (7). Drawing more black
applicants, (8). Community responsi-
bility of the WAL student.

All these areas which are witness-
ing change and review within the
faculty now. We need student partici-
pation to gain realization of these
improvements. The PSA is for all
students interested in bettering WAL.
We meet in the seminar room under
the library on Monday nights, Lets
see some student activism. We can
turn all this talk into action with
more student interest

may even get frustrated enough to
organize a boycott. Some may put
up their own independent candidates
to upset the “cliques.” Only one thing
is certain, all but the individual
candidates’ fraternity brothers will be
calling for a change in what they
nebulously refer to as “the system.”

Certainly it would seem that there
is a great deal of collusion between
certain houses. In the past couple of
years the Phi Kaps have all but
dominated the EC. Beta has also
been a permanent fixture and oc-
casionally SAE, ZBT, and SPE have
made shows of force. One wonders
why it is that a new electoral system
has not been devised if the same
houses perennially lock up the com-
mittee posts,

The answer to the problem is not
very satisfying. It's somewhat dis-
turbing to realize that the present
system has only been around some
four years. Before that time, however,
student politics wallowed in a mire
of organized cliques.

Post-war W&L found the Univer-
sity’s eighteen fraternities divided into
two political parties. The party system

was a simple, painless, and efficient balance.

 

method of choosing class officers.
Each house belonged to a_ political
party, and each house voted uniformly
for it’s party’s candidates. Freshmen
were absorbed into the system from
their first weeks of pledging.

The two post-war parties were the
University and Independent parties.
Despite the name of the latter, there
was no semblance of independence in
either party. They were “cliques” and
they used that word to describe them-
selves. By far the more powerful
was the University party. Although
there were switches in party align-
ment from time to time, the com-
ponent fraternities of the University
party were Beta Theta Pi, Delta
Upsilon, Kappa Alpha, Phi Delta
Theta, Phi Kappa Sigma, Pi Kappa
Alpha, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma
Nu, and Zeta Beta Tau, They held a
numerical edge of one over the Inde-
pendent party which consisted of
Delta Tau Delta, Kappa Sigma,
Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Epsilon Pi,
Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Kappa Psi,
Pi Kappa Phi, and Sigma Chi.

Such a party breakdown turned out
to be fairly sound due to the 9-8

Camelot
faulty acting and

By KIRK WOODWARD

Camelot is more than a bad film;
it is the classic bad film of the past
ten years or so. It is a donkey on
which every clever critic pins his
favorite insults, (That was one.) But
in its own ponderous, unsubtle way,
it is also a trap. To see the trap,
imagine a critic panning the film:

“Even on Broadway, Camelot never
looked comfortable. Arthur fell out
of a tree in the first scene and in-
vented civilization and the Round
Table in the second scene. The
film has not digested its materials any
better than the musical did. Its tone
shifts from scene to scene, from
musical comedy to pathos: in fact it
never recovers from that fall out of
the tree.

“All the ads say the film is visually
stunning. A quick glance shows why;
ne one involved in its design uses
any taste. The castle at Camelot, for
example. looks like a Navy destroyer
Many other “outdoor” shots look like
what they are, namely studio sets
Frames are composed by placing as
much colorful clutter within camera
range as will fit.

“Richard Harris's acting sets a sort
ef technical standard: he uses two
acting techniques, the shout and the
whisper. Normally he alternates the
two from line to line, but just be
fore intermission he combines them
in one sentence: “umma KING He
delivers his songs using the same
two crutches and the guiless arrange-
ments of Alfred Newman.”

 

panned as total disaster,

screenplay hurt

Eic., ete. Fun’s fun, but mean-
while there’s something to be learned
from the failure of this film, Look
at the issues raised in Camelot: Arthur
dreams of a truly civilized world;
Guenivere and Lancelot cannot recon-
cile their roles in Aruthr’s dream
with their love for each other. How
can a film begin to portray a dream
like Arthur's or a dilemma like Lance-
lot's and Guenivere's?

One way is to try to understand
the characters, the way Alan Arkin
understands Mr. Singer in “The Heart
is a Lonely Hunter.” This approach
requires creative work, in fact an
intellectual effort. Another approach
is to create an emotional effect so
strong that nobody feels he needs to
use his intelligence. Camelot tries that
one. It represents Arthur's dream with
vague talk about Justice and with
shots of ruthless villains destroying
pastel greeting-card prettiness. It
represents the lovers’ dilemma by
showing lots of furrowed brows and
by going all weepy in moments of
tension.

Everybody recognizes that Camelot
fuils, whatever it tries to do, Still,
the emotional movie-beast triumphs
more often than not, Some of the
species, like In the Heat of the Night,
encourage depravity in audiences;
Camelot is too dull to do that, so
it simply degrades and humiliates its
characters. Tt is only vacuous, but
the sticcessful examples are vicious.
One cannot be too careful about
wentifying them

(Now, whats the trap?)

however, the University party usually
controlled the elections. Between
1958-60, though, the first cracks in
the system began to appear. In a
controversial and crucial move, the
Sigma Chi’s switched their allegiance
to the University party in 1958, This
gave the party a big advantage and
elections ceased to be decided at the
polls. Each year the party nominating
convention would divide up the offices
among the houses. In what was be-
ginning to amount to a one party
system, the nominating convention
became in effect, an appointive com-
mittee.

The key to any potential Independ-
ent party successes lay in the non-
fraternity men. There were a large

smaiee of them, but they were for
the most part unorganized. In 1960,
however, the catalyst was devised
which spelled the end of the party
system. An eighteenth fraternity,
Sigma Phi Epsilon, was formed which
united some of these non-Greeks for
the first time. More importantly, the
SPE’s were unaffiliated and could
change the electoral setup to a more
competitive level.

Hungry for power and recognition,
the SPE’s turned to the University
party in 1962. The result was a top-
heavy system that couldn't possibly
work. Finally, in the spring of 1963,
the whole issue exploded. The Uni-
versity party divided into two fac-
tions, each absorbing some of the
old Independent houses. The split also
marked the division of Red Square
against itself for the first time.

The two new conglomerates now
had nine houses each. The seceding
group, Progressives, were made up
of Delta Tau Delta, Kappa Sigma,
Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Kappa Psi,
Pi Kappa Alpha. Sigma Alpha
Fpsilon and Zeta Beta Tau. The re-

Barbs and Bristles ...

Our unco-operative

By Jeffrey Wexler
Columnist

CLARIFICATION — Numerous
personages great and small have sur-
prised me by commenting favorably
on my fulminations here. They have
in the main, however, remarked that
while the language was enjoyed the
sense was incomprehensible. I agree.
SOCLAL NOTES FROM THE
OTHER OTHER SIDE... o@,
“Who got my gold inlaid bathtub?”
There are no sidewalks in Providence
Hill. Drainage systems are rudiment-
ary. In this Lexington neighborhood
some of the streets are more gravel
than macadam tar. Yet this writer
found the people there to a great
degree both happy and civilized. How
baffling.

STUDENT POWER — It is al-
ways pleasant to know the extent of
our guillibility. The magnitude is great
when it comes to that red brickwork
building with the word “buffoon”
written on one corner. When my
father was here some quarter of a
century ago, that building was the
“Mess”—later, “The Dope Shop.”
This is still true for both apellations,
The building houses the “Co-op"—a
true misnomer; “Mess” or “Dope
Shop” would be far more fitting.

There's nothing cooperative about
that lamentable institution. The hold-
ers of that franchise are in the cat-
bird's seat and they know it. Examine
the University Supply Store for your-
self. Examine its malpractices one
by one.

There is a certain knowledge known
only to God and The Ring-tum Phi
(which is probably the first time in
history that the Deity has been so
paired). Only He and they know the
number of surveys, polls, and refe-
rendums in which we have been
privileged to participate these recent
days. For all the general concern with
the intangibles of Honor and Cur-
riculum, when was the last time any-
one asked you what you'd like to see
in the fahem) “Co-op?”

Would you like to see magazines
sold there? Would you like to see
records and tapes sold there? Would
you like to see students working be-
hind the counter——as they do in Mrs.
Munger's bookstore (located in the
heart of the Uncooperative, but not
truly part of it)? Would you like to
see second-hand texts sold there as
well as new ones?

Are the textbook and stationery
prices low enough? Enough. The Un-
cooperative is but a monopoly farmed
out to Lexington businessmen. Busi-
nessmen whens sole motivation ee

cording to Economics 101-102) is, of

“Now hold on there,” some card-
carrying YAF member is probably
seething. “Do you,” he asks me to
himself, “have something against
Capitalism?” “Lord love Mother, the
Flag and our Socialist ABC Store,
no,” I answer meekly.

But (Here It Comes) | dare sug-
gest, kiddies, that the “Co-op” is a
public utility. It is a creation of this
University. And we, among other
demographic minorities, are this Uni-
versity. We are, the faculty and ad-
ministration are. And the “Co-op”
exploits us all.

One might suggest that “Co-op” be
run for and by the inhabitants of this
University rather than by franchise
to a non-W&L party. This minority
of one did so suggest as a “candidate”
(tongue-in-cheek, foot-in-mouth) in
the Student Body Presidency race last
April.

Ruggers

“A game for hooligans, played by
gentlemen” is the definition of rugby,
a rough-but-merry cross between
American football and soccer. Wash-
ington and Lee’s Rugby Football Club
is presently engaged in spring
campaign, bringing a Europeon flavor
to the realm of W&L athletics

Ihe sport itself founded at
Rugby School, England, in the late
nineteenth century when a member
of the Rugby soccer varsity became
disgusted, picked up the ball, and
ran it into the goal. Although ex-
pelled for his troubles, this young
man had provided the spark that grew
into rugby, appropriately named for
his alma mater. Rugby grew behind
the popular sport of soccer in Europe,
and eventually became widely-played
by gentlemen throughout the British
empire. Rugby failed to catch on in
football-oriented America, but re
cently has gained in popularity along
with its more orthodox cousin, soccer,
Rugby played with fifteen men
on each team, with the squad roughly

resemblance to the football backfield
The game combines the skills associat-
with tackling, running, kicking,
and passing into a fluid movement de-
signed to run the ball across the op
ponent’s goal line. Three points are
awarded for this type of score (known
“try”), two for the place-kicked
and three points for a
successful penalty kick. The ball re-
sembles an oversized football—longer,
lighter, and more blunt than its
American counterpart. It takes a cer-
tain breed of man to play rugby;
the principle involved in tackling the
football runner is employed in the
sport, except the players don’t wear
equipment. In addition, the amount of
running is comparable to soccer,
the necessity of being in shape is
apparent. So we find that stamina,
agility, size, and toughness are pre-
requisites for the ideal player. Rugby,
however, is not all brawn and blood
(although any player will attest to
the relative importance of these ele
ments); an integral part of each con
test the time-honored keg party
after the game, where grudges creat
ed during the match are drowned
along with the pain of numerous
culs and bruises.

Szlasa lauds
quick offense
of LX team

Coach Dick Szlasa of the varsity
lacrosse team admitted he had doubts
about the Blue’s offensive punch until
the practice match with Roanoke last
Saturday morning at Wilson Field.
The defense, which has been the back-
bone for the team, held fast but it
was the quick aggressive offense that
was most surprising to the W&L win.

There is no C.A.C. competition in
this sport, so W&L is in an all-class
district with other colleges and uni-
versities in this area disregarding
size. The powerhouse in this district
is consistently Washington College
but challengers include Duke, U.N.C.,
and others.

Coach Szlasa picked co-captain
Charlie Stewart as his most outstand
ing team member. “Charlie isn’t a
natural athlete, but he’s made up for
this through competiveness, which has
made me a_ believer in Charlie
Stewart,” summed up Szlasa.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

An Experiment Worth Trying...

By LAWRENCE McCONNELL

On February 21, 1969 the Friday Ring-tum
Phi presented an editorial concerning the
establishment of Free Universities at various
colleges in our vicinity. At the conclusion
of the editorial, we stated we felt that a simi-
lar program would work at W&L—if the
students expressed interest.

In conjunction with our initial stand, I
have investigated the possibilities of a type
of Free University here. Professors in many
departments have expressed a great interest in
the idea—but are somewhat skeptical about
student support. Professors that have ex-
pressed an interest in the program range
from Professors George Ray, James Boat-
wright and Peter Cummings in the English
department to Professors Lee Kahn and David
Hall in the fine arts department, to Professor
Delos Hughes in the political science depart-
ment. The sociology and religion departments
have expressed an interest as well.

Along with this array of support from the
faculty, President Robert Huntley has given
his endorsement to an endeavor modeled after
the Free University.

The Free Forum .. .

With this interest in mind, and with the
limited yet encouraging response from con-
versations with students, I intend to present
a plan for a modified Free University—a Free
Forum—before the EC next Monday night.
With EC approval and support, I expect that
after organization of a committee is made by
the EC that the first session of the Free

Forum will be on Saturday, April 12, at
11:00 in the morning.

The program would consist of approxi-
mately five topics of interest to both students
and faculty members, each forum group meet-
ing at the same time each week. The topics
chosen would be those presented by a com-
mittee formed by the E.C. Later, if other
topics seem timely or of interest, they could
be added to the program as well.

Although support from faculty and ad-
ministration is present, the main factor in the
establishment of a project such as the Free
Forum is support from the students. The
project would be worthless if professors or
speakers found little or no interest in the
program. It cannot happen without student
involvement.

Its Purpose .. .

During the past few years, universities
throughout the country have witnessed the
creation of what has been tagged the “Free
University,” or the “Experimental College.”’
These educational phenomena have been a
reaction to “. . . . the stiff formality of the
conventional classroom, the aridity and _ ir-
relevance—in the student’s view—of much of
the official curriculum” (Time, October 21,
1966).

The purpose of many originators of these
programs has been to present courses which
they feel are relevant to present society in the
hope that their university would adopt them
at a later date. Other supporters of the Free
University have advanced a different reason:

some medium is needed for the discussion and
examination of topics of interest that is not
(and perhaps should not) be present in their
school’s curriculum,

Perhaps this latter line of thought would
be a more valid reason for the establishment
of a Free Forum here at Washington and
Lee. Due to problems of our size and scope,
the normal Free University with its prolifera-
tion of courses would probably not be feasible
or even desirable at present. But these prob-
lems would not prevent the creation of a
modified Free University — a weekly Free
Forum which would allow the discussion and
exploration of topics of interest to students
and professors. The range of topics a student
would have to choose from could be varied,
yet small in number.

A Free Forum such as this could be quite
possible here. Meetings for the Forum could
be on Saturday morning at 11:00 when fac-
ulty as well as students are relatively free.
Since none of the classrooms are in use at
this time, President Huntley has made them
available for use by the Free Forum. A stu-
dent would be able to choose between five
topics which might range from the U.S.
position in Southeast Asia to an examination
of the modern cinema or from the discussion
about the “God is dead” theology to per-
forming improvisations on stage.

Its Advantages .. .

The advantage of a Free Forum on Satur-
day morning are threefold. First, students
would have an opportunity to discuss inform-

ally a topic of their special interest with an
equally interested professor. This would elimi-
nate the classroom approach to many courses
in our curriculum, because the “course” in
a Free Forum would need no prepared lecture
by a professor and no tests or notes taken by
the student.

Another advantage is that the time and
place already are available and convenient.
There would be no need to shift the time
of meeting each week. With Saturdays being
relatively free now, interested students ought
to be willing and able to give up an hour out
of their time on Saturday.

Third, with a minimum of conflicts in time
and the scheduling of the forum on the
weekend, the program ought to provide stu-
dents the opportunity to discuss topics of
interest with women from the surrounding
schools. Students could bring their dates to
the forum, or women from neighboring
schools might come to participate. The
chances for this co-educational experience
might be greater if a professor from a nearby
women’s college came to lead a discussion per-
sonally, bringing with him any students that
might be interested.

Its Potential...

With a minimum of planning, the Free
Forum can be a reality. The time and the
place are right; the topics proposed would
be interesting; and the professors would be
stimulating. As was said in our February
21 editorial, “it is only through the students
that the experiment can work.” And the Free
Forum is an experiment worth trying.

Lack Of Student Interest
Shows General Approval

The student body’s interest in the Honor System was
clearly revealed Wednesday evening when only a handful of
students (about 40, including all of the Executive Committee
members except senior EC representative Bill Brown) showed

up in Lee Chapel for the Bitch-In.

The small crowd was disappointing to us because the issue
at hand, namely the Honor System, has been an important
bone of contention all year. Students have been complaining
about it constantly, yelling for change. Yet, when they finally
have a chance to be heard and make suggestions they ignore

the opportunity.

The only conclusion we can come to, and
we hope the EC will finally decide upon at its
day night, is one of general approval by the
of the student body. It can only be assumed
by not showing up and airing their views on

tradition, agree entirely with the EC’s proposals and are will-
ing to let the EC use its discretion in revising the Honor |

System.

Since the facts can only be interpreted in the above man-
ner, we urge the EC to approve the procedural changes con-
cerning honor trials. In addition, we urge the EC to adopt
certain general guidelines concerning the jurisdiction of the
Honor System. (These guidelines may have to be more de-
tailed than members of the EC may want, but they must be
established to eliminate the ambiguity that currently exists.)

These revisions will undoubtedly strengthen the Honor
System, for it will prove that a strong tradition can keep up
with the changing needs of a changing student body. In the
end, all of us can be proud that this system can weather
student changes and will not be allowed to stagnate by in-

herent weaknesses.

By BILL WALKER
Freshman Law Student

When the Executive Committee of
the student body announced recently
its intention to effect a study of the
Honor System, there was hope that
at least there might be a systematic
reevaluation of both its dictates and
its administration, and that a thorough
program of change might be instituted
in an attempt to temper our law
with justice.

It was also hoped that the Executive
Committee might devise a plan to
divest itself of some of its awesome
and unchecked power in matters deal-
ing with the Honor System. But the
changes which have been proposed
by the Committee will only add to
it, power, and further isolate our
Honor System from justice.

 

The central concern manifested by
the Committee's proposals is that the
traditional rules of procedure im-
pede the function of the Honor Sys-
tem as they understand it. We are
told that the sole purpose of the
Committee is to ascertain the facts
of an alleged violation, and to render
a judgment thereon. It is apparently
felt that all precautions must be taken
to insure that me guilty party be
allowed to escape retribution and
exile, without regard to individual
right or justice. The central concern
of the proposals is obviously the sys-
tem itself, the absolute efficacy of
i the law.

tee has overlooked or ignored the
fact that laws are instituted by man
for man, and that the law is only
a method for ordering our lives.
The goal of any legal system must
be the equitable administration of
justice. When the law becomes its
own end, an omnipotent and in-
fallible deity, justice is defeated,
and only raw power remains, That
power directs itself toward the de-
struction of the individual to pre-
serve the system. Any changes
serve only the law not man,

The Executive Committee, its
proposed procedural changes, has
demonstrated great concern for the
system, but none for the protection
of the individual. In its attempt to
eliminate all procedural technicali-
ties, the Commitiee has lost sight of
individual rights and justice. The in-
dividual is reduced simply to a tool
of the system. The first responsibility
that the Committee feels seems to be
to the system itself, and not to the
thirteen hundred men who grant its
existence.

ADVERSARY SYSTEM

The Committee has stated that the
adversary system is to be avoided.
But is such avoidance meant to pro-
tect the individual or the law? The
adversary system is designed so that
each side must accept total responsi-

responsibility, to most efficiently and
convincingly present its case, will
win. It prevents giving all the ad-
vantages to the prosecution, the law,
as the Committee seems to favor. If
ii sometimes allows the guilty to
escape, it also protects all parties,
and guarantees due process of law.

The Committee further proposes
that the President of the student body
preside at the public appellate trial.
Perhaps this would serve to protect
the initial conviction by the Executive
Committee, but it offers little pro-
tection to the accused. It is an
obvious invitation to executive parti-
ality. It would allow the same judge
to hear both the trial and appeal,
and therefore to bring to the appeal!
definite preconceptions and prejudices.

previous hearing and judgment. Thus
men would be forsaken to strengthen
the system,

The Executive Committee also pro-
poses that the Jury be allowed to
summon and question its own wil-
nesses. Again, the Committee invites
partiality and prejudice. Evidence
should be presented te the jury, not
solicited by the jury. Otherwise, the
deliberating body is simultaneously
an investigationg body, which is an
irreconcilable conflict of duty.

INDIVIDUAL PROTECTION
I agree with the Executive Com-
mitiee that a need exists for pro-
cedural change, but I feel that
emphasis should be directed toward
protection of the individual; the

Hodges explained in a recent inter-

The corporation is a private, non-

build a 40-unit housing project. If
the group secures approval from the
Federal Housing Authority, it will

borrow from private sources the
money necessary to construct the
housing. The loan would be insured
by FHA

The housing would be managed by
the corporation and anyone in the
community could rent, although the
corporation would establish its own

Dr. Hodges explains that a family

Bucknell is one of the top teams in
its league.

In describing Bucknell, Coach
Szlasa sees much similarity between
them and Franklin and Marshall, a
team the Generals beat in a practice
scrimmage 8-4, Both F&M and Buck-
nell are big teams physically, but the
Generals rely on good shooting, team
balance and strong defense to com
pensate for this disadvantage.

to submit a frightened and upset

without representation of his own

Committee accept the proposal that
an accused violator be given a mini-
mum notice of twenty-four hours
prior to trial, The accused needs

to prepare his own defense. It is

patently unjust to force an ac- choosing.

is a column of general editorial
comment for which contributions

By PROF, DELOS D. HUGHES

A case may be made that there is
no appropriate place for grading aca-
demic performance at all, but I do
not wish to argue it. Grading stu-
dents is a practice of long standing
which will certainly stand much
longer yet. The demand for evalua-
tion of faculty is a persistent student
request and it is likely to become
more insistent with time. So long as
we grade student performance, we
ought to do it as well as possible.
So long as the demand for evaluation
of faculty continues, we ought not to
reject the possibility out of hand.

In an academic community, evalua-
tion of the members is bound to be
troublesome. The propriety of grading
students and rating faculty is a sub-
stantial question, But whether or not
grading is intrinsically inimical to
education, there is certainly enormous
difficulty in putting into quantitative
terms (grades) what is essentially
qualititative—how well one is edu-
cated or how well one educates
others. And there are certainly pos-
sible threats to academic freedom
which arise in evaluating faculty per-
formance.

Student interest in rating teaching
skill is understandable. In fact many
faculty members only resist the idea
because they know no way to do a
good job of evaluating such perform-
ance. In teaching and learning, the
criteria for satisfactory accomplish-
ment are hard to agree upon and
harder still to put into a form for
which a satisfactory test can be de-
veloped.

We do now assume that it is pos-
sible to test satisfactorily how much
and how well a student has learned.
The assumption has clear deficiencies,
of course, but if we disregard them in
the interests of improving the exist-
ing system, could we assume that the
performance of the student on ex-
aminations reflects the ability and
energy of his teachers? The answer
clearly is No, and the reason is evi-
dent: the functions of teacher and
examiner are performed by the same
person. It should not require much
exposition for the reader to see the
undesirable ramifications of this ar-
rangement. The desirable reform is

 

‘The way I see it’

(Editor’s note: “The way I see it’ are solicited from students and

faculty concerning any topic.)

nearly self-evident. Let some teach
and others evaluate. With experience
under such an arrangement, norms of
student performance can be used to
evaluate the success of teachers, And
we avoid the anomolous situation of
having a teacher as judge of how
well he himself has taught.

Every objection and weakness that
I can foresee might be charged to
this innovation, save one, can be
charged to the present system, which
does not have the redeeming features
of the reform. The exception is the
economic consideration. Considering,
however, the proportion of faculty
time now occupied by testing, it
should be at least theoretically pos-
sible to accomplish the change with-
out additional expense simply by
specializing functions. Nor should it
matter greatly in terms of expense in-
volved that examiners be brought
from outside our faculty to do the
job. That arrangement in fact would
promote objectivity and our keeping

 

abreast of the standards of the wider
academic community.

It ought to be undisputed that grad-
ing is properly done by a university |
for its own purposes primarily, Wash- |
ington and Lee is not properly auxili-
ary to other institutions such as gradu- |
ate schools, corporations, govern. |
mental or military agencies. The!
merits of our grading system there-
fore should be defensible with regard
to the purposes of liberal education
alone. Otherwise we ought to abandon
it.

Reward for accomplishment does
not of itself partake of any educa-
tional qualities that | can observe.
Unless there is an element of in-
centive in the award, no apparent
educational purpose is served, It may
seem fitting to reward what would
have been accomplished without the
anticipation of recognition, but it is
not educational. The educational |
merits of a grading system turn on its |
effectiveness as an incentive, and it
does appear, notwithstanding some |
dispute, that grades are effective in-
centives. For reasons which often have |
nothing to do with future employ-|
ment or graduate school admission, |
students apparently are impelled to}

Mills-Wright team captures fourth

 

place, winning five of six debates

Chris Mills, coming out of debate, Cardell, Bill Radigan, Kevin Baker,

retirement for the first time
year, joined together with Tim

Wright this past week to win five of
six debates at American University
in Washington and to win for W&l
a silver cup for placing fourth out
of 60 teams. The Mills-Wright combi-
nation beat teams from Grinnell,
Indiana University, Canisius, Stan
ford University and Catholic Univer
sity while losing to Rutgers.

Last year Mills, a senior now, quali-
fied for the National Championship
Debate Tournament but was prevent-
ed from going because of the tragic
death of his partner Tommy Bare-
more, just hours after the Mills-Bare-

more team had qualified
tionals. Two weekends ago, Wright
qualified for this year’s National

fournament, along with a treshman

EC defers vote on jurisdictional limits, okays procedure

Monday holiday
bites the dust

Proposed procedural changes in
the Washington and Lee Honor Code
were approved unanimously last night
by the Executive Committee, but a
proposal which dealt with the jurisdic-
tional limits of the code was deferred
until a meeting after spring vacation
The commitice also heard Jay Pas-
savant announce that the Faculty
Executive Committee had rejected a
request for the cancellation of April
7 classes. The committee reasoned
that 1) students would have no dif-
ficulty returning and 2) the committee
was reluctant to act on schedule
changes without faculty's opinions
being heard.

The EC's decision to postpone vot-
ing on the jurisdictional limits of the
Honor Code was prompted by a con-
troversy over where the code should
apply. Danny Leonard, chairman of
the committee on jurisdictional limits
for the Honor Code, advocated that
the code be enforced only within the
limits of the University. It was argu
ed, however, that a system which set |
such limits might undermine any at-|
tempts to instill honor in WAL stu-|
dents and thus be self-defeating |

Steve Sandler offered a proposal
which would settle the question of
jurisdictional limits by requiring the |
EC to consider any case brought!
before it. In this way the place of |
the offense would not determine if}
the cause came under the Honor Code’s
jurisdiction |

W&L swimmers Billy Ball

and Bill Brumback earned All-

America status for their excellent performances in the College
National Swimming Championships last weekend at Spring-
field College. Brumback finished 6th in the 50 yard freestyle,
while Ball scored 6th in the 100 yard backstroke and a 9th

in the 200 yard backstroke.

The W&L swimmers scored a total*¥——

of 22 points which boosted W&L into
17th place out of the 72 colleges
represented at the meet. The meet
was won by the University of Cali-
fornia at Irvine,

In the preliminary trials Brumback
qualified 2nd with a time of 22.2
seconds. In the finals he dropped to
6th place with a time of 22.3 seconds.
Ball qualified Sth in the 100 yard
backstroke with a time of 57.8 sec-
onds, and dropped to 6th in the
finals, while lowering his time to 57.5
seconds.

Ball also finished 9th in the 200
yard backstroke with a time of 2:08.5
seconds; any swimmer who finishes in
the top 12 places is awarded All-
status, Freshman John
Lawlor and Bib Clark also traveled
to Springfield and participated in a
400 yard medley relay.

Coach Stearns, a graduate of
Springfield College, enjoyed the re-
turn especially with the triumph of
Ball and Brumback. The Springfield
pool is one of the newest and most
modern in America. It is equipped
with movable bulkheads so the pool
can be adjusted to any length from
50 meters to 23% yards.

The Springfield pool is also equip-
ped with automatic timers which time
to one-hundredth of a second which
was the downfall of Brumback in the
100 yard freestyle. Brumback qualifi-
ed 13th with a time of 49.79 seconds
and 12th place went to a time of
49.76 seconds.

Coach Stearns said he was excep-

tionally pleased with Brumback’s
times as they are the best of his
winning swimming career at WAL.

In the last two seasons of competi-
tion he has lost only one freestyle
sprint (SO and 100 yards). Coach
Stearns was appreciative that the Uni-
versity allowed Ball, Brumback,
Clark, and Lawlor to participate in
the college championships.

Balls winning of All-American

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Some thoughts on the jurisdictional dilemma of honor

This year the Executive Committee has been forced to
take into consideration two events which raised serious ques-
tions concerning the procedure of honor trials and the jurisdic-
tional limits of the system itself. On the one hand, President
Jay Passavant and Law School representative Pete Hendricks,
two of the EC’s best three, have dealt with the procedural
issues in superb fashion, On the other hand, Vice-President
Danny Leonard has endorsed a jurisdictional provision which,
if adopted by the EC, would bastardize any semblance of
honor in the Honor System.

As we said, the Executive Committee has done a thorough
and competent job in its analysis of Honor System procedural
questions, allowing moderate changes to be implemented which
1) guarantee the student a fairer trial, as he may face his
accusers and ask questions of any witness and 2) insure the
EC’s ability to conduct a public trial on a basis consistent with
private trials.

Leonard’s proposal

Danny Leonard discussed jurisdictional limits at length
with professors in every department of the University and
has, we are certain, devoted a great deal of thought to this
question. In his report to the Executive Committee, he ac-
knowledged two limits of the Honor System:

1) The scope of the Honor System shall include all instances of
lying, cheating, and stealing by a person assumed to be a student at
Washington and Lee University. In such instances, both the nature of the
offense and the motives of the accused shall be taken into consideraion.

2) The scope of the Honor System shall include all instances of
lying, cheating, and stealing that develop on property falling under the
jurisdiction of Washington and Lee University or in conjunction with
any University function or activity.

The first of these is dismissed by Mr. Leonard as maintain-
ing “too many gray areas” in a system which could “call
for holding a boy responsible to the Honor System for some-
thing he has done, yet the Student Body and the EC might
not consider that act dishonorable.”’ In defense of the second,
limited jurisdiction, Mr. Leonard said, “Our system can only
realistically apply itself to the W&L community,” which he
interprets as W&L property in most instances.

Implicit codification

At last Wednesday’s “Bitch-in” one student commented if
Mr. Leonard’s proposal is accepted, we would have a situation
of “on-campus gentlemen and out-of-town thieves.” Perhaps;
perhaps not. But the possibility is there; Washington and Lee’s
Honor System would be relegated to a standard of conduct
applicable only to the campus—which is, in our opinion,
implicit codification.

The results could portend a pathetic comedy of errors
for the tradition of honor. A student could steal records from
an apartment, forge a check to a local merchant, lie to Uni-
versity proctor Bob Murray at a fraternity house, or cheat
on the Civil Service Examination at the Post Office and would
not be held responsible under the Honor System.

The realm of interpretation

What is involved here is not the discovery of a new, cure-
all code. We don’t need one. Mr. Leonard talks about gray
areas—fine! If you get rid of the uncertain fringe, then you
have a codified set of rules whose tautness and complexity
form a mesh oblivious to interpretation.

And interpretation of the Honor System is the very rea-
son we, as students, allow the EC to function as an honor
court. Twelve men are elected to defend the tradition of honor
at this University and, as a necessary adjunct of that responsi-
bility, to decide, after weighing facts and circumstances, the
applicability of honor’s guidelines against lying, cheating, and

stealing.
“Gentlemen”?

When this edition faced off with the EC earlier this
year, it was not a question of improper jurisdictional limits
but rather that we felt the limits were improperly applied. This
is a question of interpretation.

And what makes Washington and Lee’s Honor System
what it is—one of the best—is that there is room for interpre-
tation. Thus the clearest admonition that can be given any
student is simply “be a gentleman; and gentlemen do not
lie, cheat, or steal.”’ If any of us is so unaware that he cannot
decide for himself what this admonition means, then it is
entirely possible he will at some time be asked to withdraw.
And the beauty of interpretation is that if he commits a
violation, every opportunity is given to justify it; there are
no hard and fast rules.

Mr. Leonard's proposal would totally negate our right to
the use of the word “gentleman.” We would, in effect, be
condoning unethical conduct everywhere except on campus.
And quite another disturbing aspect of this is that three other
members of the EC, as well as about half of the students
present when a straw vote was taken at the “Bitch-in,” are in
favor of the second proposal.

A decision of honor

We are a closed, selective community
surveyed, physical limits but in terms of the type of person
who is allowed to remain among us. And as such we need
not observe arbitrary legal procedure or limits, as Bill Walker
and Jack Horowitz suggest.

Washington and Lee wants to graduate men of character
and integrity, men who don’t need (or want) to be told where
they may lie, cheat, or steal and where they may not do so. In
most cases, W&L’s students know. In those instances of un-
certainly, it is the mark of honor for a student to decide for
himself what is right and what is not right.

not in terms of

Temperance ys, exactitude
Those who are in favor of strict adherence to legal pro-
cedure are, we fear, afraid to place their faith in the good

intentions of the Honor System. But they neglect to realize
that these essentially “free” legal trappings we enjoy have
allowed the necessary temperance which consistently refuses to
convict an innocent person, whereas diligent legalities may
lead to an inherent unfairness.

And those who are searching for exact jurisdictional speci-
fications refuse to acknowledge the EC’s ability to interpret,
and then go on to condone certain dishonorable situations by
implication.

Vote tomorrow!

The Executive Committee will present for a vote by the
student body tomorrow its amendments to the constitution.
These amendments involve reshaping election procedure so
that it is more flexible and fair and several minor but wholly
necessary deletions and additions to bring the constitution
up to date.

In the past, constitutional amendments have not fared
well—even when needed—because of a lack of voter turnout.
Although these amendments are not earthshaking and do not
lend themselves to lively discussion, we urge everyone to vote
tomorrow so that the new provisions can go into effect
immediately.

Staff editorial

In defense of tribunals

We would like to take issue with many of the arguments
and assumptions inherent in Bill Walker’s criticism of the
Honor System in last Friday’s Ring-tum Phi. The basic issue
is whether the Honor System is basically a set of laws and
therefore subject to the structures and conventions of the
— legal system or whether it is something quite dif.
erent.

The Honor System is a privilege that has been won by
the last hundred years of W&L students and is endowed with
something much more significant than the mere force of law.
The EC and its methods of the secret honor trial have evolved
with the Honor System according to the demands of the
System. Therefore, we feel that the basic framework of the
honor trial are those that are best suited for the Honor System

at W&L.

 

Unchecked power?

The EC is rebuked for not limiting its own “awesome and
unchecked power.’ The EC’s power is certainly awesome, but
it can hardly be described as unchecked. The basic check is
the public honor trial and every EC member comes up for
election yearly which is a secondary check on any aribitrary
EC action.

The EC makes every human effort to decide whether a
person is guilty or not. A former EC member stated that he
would rather 100 violators remained on campus than one
innocent student be convicted. Many other EC members
voice similar sentiments. Mr. Walker’s statement that “it is
apparently fele that all precautions must be taken to insure
that no gulity party be allowed to escape retribution and
exile” is far from the actual truth. The majority of the EC
convictions in recent years have all been due to open and shut
cases of plagiarism or theft. Conviction involving the judg-
ment of the EC where the proof of the crime is not absolute
are few and far between.

Tribunal vs. adversary

Mr. Walker, in defense of the adversary system, states
that this system would prevent “giving all the advantages to
the prosecution, the law, as the Committee seems to favor.”
This assumes that the EC during an honor trial views itself
as the prosecution. No one on the EC is out to prosecute or
“get” the accused. They are objectively attempting to de-
termine guilt or innocence. The tribunal system, although not
used extensively in the United States courts, is a valid court
system and is an acceptable alternative to the adversary system.
In the case of the Honor System, the merits of the tribunal sys-
tem far outweigh those of the adversary system,

The adversary system would in the long run work to the
benefit of the prosecutor as we argued in an earlier editorial.
It would require the EC to set aside one or more of its mem-
bers as prosecutor; most ideally this should be the senior law
representative, unless the EC chose to create a new elective
office of EC “DA” whose only function would be to convict as
many people as he could. The adversary system implies that
there will be someone trying his best to convict the accused
regardless of guilt or innonce.

Little would be gained

The remainder of the EC would then have to act as jury
and would they be able to ask questions to satisfy their own
judgments? Mr. Walker states that the jury in a public honor
trial should not be able to ask questions (and rightly so) ;
then should those members of the EC be able to ask questions?
Finally what will be the level of competence of that student
selected as defense attorney? Will the defense attorney, unless
a law student, have the competence to equal the experienced
EC prosecutor? And how many undergraduates know law stu-
dents well enough to depend upon them entirely in an honor
trial?

We feel that the present system has more than enough
safeguards to protect an innocent student and is not this
justice? The procedural and theoretical changes needed to
convert to the adversary system could very seriously weaken the
Honor System while adding so very little to the accused's
rights that it is not in the best interest of the Honor System

 

and the student body to make this change. —R.W.K.

 

Party shifts caused
end of clique power

Second of two parts

By ROY CARLTON
Editorial-Page Editor

The political rupture in W&L
campus politics in the spring of 1963
marked the beginning of the end for
the political party at W&L. The key
to parties had always been tradition.
Now, with the breaking of the old
bonds, the various house politicos
found it somewhat difficult to forge
new ones.

Spring election marked the first
time in decades in which Red Square
had been split. The new Progressive
and University parties found them-
selves being led by the leaders of
the old University party. Most signifi-
cant, though, was the division of nine
houses into each party which guaran-
teed the prospect of a close two-party
election.

The spring contests also marked
the first time that the University’s
two biggest political houses were fac-
ing each other: Sigma Alpha Epsilon
was Progressive while Beta Theta
Pi led the new University party. Not
surprisingly, it was these two houses
which supplied their party's Presi-
dential nominee.

In a close hard-fought election in
which the Independent Union offici-
ally endorsed the Progressive slate,
Bill Noell, the Progressive candidate
squeezed out Buck Ogilvie of the
University party. Each party found
itself well represented within the new
EC, and it appeared as if the turmoil
was going to die.

Not for long. After an uneventful
Freshman election in the fall in
which the Progressives captured the
EC seat, party unrest began to re-
appear. Once again it was Sigma
Phi Epsilon, this time in conjunction
with Delta Tau Delta, who upset the
balance of power. While both houses
sent representatives to the Progressive
nominating caucus, they sent a sec-
ond team of representatives to the
University caucus which took place
the same night. The houses finally
switched their allegiance upon the
University party nomination of a
SPE for Secretary. The stunned Pro-
gressives didn't learn of the ma-
nuever, which left them with only
seven houses, until the next day.

In the subsequent student body and
class elections, the University party
with its large majority won an over-
whelming share of races. Yet almost
immediately after the elections, the
new University party ran into the
problems the old University party had
run into. The clique was too un-
wieldy. The party dissolved, and a
new party, the Liberty party, was
formed. The Liberty party ran along
the same lines as the old University
party, and once again united the Red
Square houses. Sigma Chi pledged
itself to neutrality, and the Progres-
sive party with only seven houses re-
mained a minority.

The most severe crisis and the
critical blow to the party system
came in the Freshman EC elections
the following fall. The Ring-tum Phi
took a preferential poll of the fresh-
man class just before the nominating
caucuses. Steve Saunders of ZBT
was chosen as the most qualified
freshman for the EC by a substantial
margin. Second was Jody Kline of
Phi Kap, third was John Reynolds
of Sigma Chi, and fourth was Rich-
ard Nash, a Beta.

The Liberty party was the first to
nominate a candidate with Jody Kline.
Yet only two days later, shock waves
rolled across campus when nine
houses abandoned the Liberty and
Progressive parties to form a new
University party. The action left the
Liberty party, which had yet to face
an election, with only four houses,
and the Progressive party with only
two. Three houses were independent,

The selection of Richard Nash as
University party nominee left him as
the only candidate with solid party
backing. In the next few days the
Liberty and Progressive parties dis-
solved, leaving only the one party.
Jody Kline, Steve Saunders, Joe Mat-
thews, and John Reynolds were nomi-
nated as independent candidates,

This was the first multi-candidate
race in years. If the University party
lost, it might well spell the end of
party politics. A majority was need-
ed for election. If a majority didn't
exist, a run-off between the two lead.
ing primary candidates would decide
the winner.

After a furious campaign, the in-
dependenis managed to prevent 4
party majority. Though it won a
plurality, Nash was forced to run
against Saunders in a second ballot,
Despite the significance of the issues,
voter apathy ran high. Abstentions
might just have swung the election as
Nash won by only five votes: 146-

141. The clique had survived, but it
had hardly received a hearty en-
dorsement.

The last party election was held
the following spring. The University

 

party slate faced only one serious
opponent, Independent candidates for
Vice-President and Secretary were
submitted at the last minute. Yet
Fred Mindel of ZBYT waged a hard
fight for the Presidency against party
candidate Chuck Walker of Kappa
Sig. The result was a landslide vote
for Mindel as voters repudiated the
clique. Following the Big Four elc-
tions the University party officially
disbanded, leaving the campus party-
less for the first time within memory.

Party politics has never again rais-
ed its ugly head. With the parties,
big house politics have dissolved too.
Don't let anyone fool you that today’s
elections are clique-run. If they were,
Jeff Wexler would not have polled
200 votes last year.

LETTERS 10 THE EDITOR

Intolerable situation

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:
Wednesday night I attended the

“Bitch-in” held in Lee Chapel. The

session proved very interesting and I

came away with new admiration for

the efficiency and dedication of the

 

men who make up our Executive
Committee.
However, there is one issue on

which I feel compelled to comment.
This concerns the jurisdiction of the
Honor System. There is currently a
proposal, being given quite a bit of
support, which would limit the ap-
plication of the Honor System to
events that take place on the campus
itself.

For instance, as was pointed out
at the “Bitch-in,” if a student stole
a bathing suit, lied and cheated on
a weekend visit to Virginia Beach,
he would not, under the new pro-
posal, be guilty of an Honor Viola-
tion,

To me this proposal is unaccept-
able. If it was instituted, | would
have to ask myself if we were
seeking to maintain an honorable stu-
dent body or just an honorable
campus.

Honor is not something that can
be “turned on” one day and “turned
off” the next. Likewise, it is not
something that can be displayed in
one locality and ignored in another.
An honorable person does not per-
form honorably on only a part-time
basis.

Therefore, if we are to continue
our Honor Sysiem, let us refrain
from compromising its integrity,
After all, the purpose of our Honor
System should not be to make
Honor a part of the “school routine,”
it should instead be one of making
Honor a part of every Washington
and Lee man’s life.

s/Steve Dugan, °72

the victim was Cleveland State’s Vik-

The tally was 6-1 as the varsity
baseballers showed power at the plate
and on the mound in taking Friday’s
game. In the first inning alert base-
running and patience at the plate
contributed the first run to the Gen-

the home team forced the Vikings

for four. Steve “Chief” Mahaffey shut
the door on any Viking aspirations
in the closing inning giving up no
runs and only two hits.

Baserunning was one of the better
points of Washington and Lee’s play.
W&L speedsters stole quite a few
bases. Gil Fitzhugh made the hustl-
ing play of the game reaching third
on a shot to right field.

Aftewards Coach Joe Lyles credited
the victory to, “The will to win—
the boys never let up out there!”

Initially in the contest the Gen-
erals put a whole pile of runners on
but had trouble getting them across
the plate. But the big break in this
streak came when Scott MecChrystal
received two RBI's for a single with
bases jammed. This precendent was
followed in a big eighth inning ex-
plosion which was triggered by hits
from Ray Coats, Jim Wilson and
Thom Mitchell.

Saturday things were a little dif-
ferent as Washington and Lee had
to count on a fine pitching perform-
ance and a big rally to grab a 8-7
come-from-behind win.

At both third base and the batting
box Steve Kalista was turning out
quite a performance. The hustling
junior took hits away from the visitors
through amazing stops and a rifle
arm. And it was Kalista’s hit to
right field that started the rally that
put W&L ahead to stay.

Stickmen suffer a setback

The weather was bad and so was
the first half for W&L’s lacrosse
team in its first match against
Bucknell. Bucknell University shock-
ed the Generals with a tight de-
fense and an aggressive offense and
took a 6-0 lead out with them at
half-time.

But in the second half an inspired
Washington and Lee team scored
four goals and cut the lead down to
two. Scoring for the home squad were
Joe Wich, Whit Morrill, Tom Gro-
ton, and John Thomas. But late in
the game Bucknell scored a pair of
goals to bring the final score to 8-4.

Bucknell’s coach described W&L’s
team as “A fine club which got be-
hind early and couldn't overcome this
early lead. I think the key to Buck-
nell’s win is that we controlled the
ground balls.”

Dick Szlasa stated that, “We fell
behind early, but I was proud that

‘The way I see it’

(Continued from Page D

real learning through fear of failing
or hope of excelling in a formal and
public way.

In common with penal systems,
educational systems are typically based
the efficacy of punishment—its
application, fear of it, and example
of it—for reinforcing learning. While
educational institutions usually place
somewhat greater emphasis on co-
ordinate rewards than do penal insti-
tutions, they are just as firm in stig-
matizing the man who fails to feel
their effect. As a sign of his ultimate
insult to academic pride, the ignorant

| man who enters the university's gates

and remains unaffected is made to
wear his scarlet F, perhaps forever.
The university could make a _ case

that the penalty is merited just be-
cause the ingrate has squandered its
time and resources, Perhaps he has
even denied another the chance to
use these opportunities to better ad-
vantage than he did. But the uni-
versity usually does not make this
case. Its rationale rests on some sacred
theory of education, some idea of
the spur which the hated grade pro-
vides to the sluggish mind and the
rein it puts on frivolous intention,
lhere books full of contrary
opinions about the validity of punitive
educational theories. One's own ex-
perience within academic communi-
ties (and perhaps penal communities)
should afford some insight into their
relative merits, But in the absence of
any consensus among those who are
counted experts in the matter, of
among those who have been directly

are

exposed to the process, there are
some other considerations that we
can examine.

If any store at all is put in being
“sensible” we may ask whether com-
mon supports the of
declaring to the academic community
or to the larger society that a student
has failed to learn a required lesson
The

cess to accomplish some task and the
man who has not tried at all

“sensibleness” of doing so seems

| but the failing grade does not reveal
lit. The F tells us that (presumbably)
a student knows nothing about
medieval history—which is just what
we ought to assume if we find no
grade at all for medieval history in
his record. Whether the student who
failed a course is lazy, dull, dis-
tracted, or perverse, his F will not
reveal. But then we cannot assume
that a student who did not take
medieval history is not lazy, or dull,
or distracted, or perverse, for it may
be that one of these is the reason
he did not take the course. Through
the grading arrangements we may be
penalizing academic initiative and re-
warding timidity. It is only sensible
then to record what has been ac-
complished rather than what has not.

Leaving aside the separate matter
of a rationale for distinguishing de-
grees of satisfactory work, the crucial
question is, of course, what is the
effect of eliminating Failure. Super-
ficially the effect is to raise GPR’s,

Lee becomes, in effect, a grant of
permission to use the facilities of
the university for a stated period of
time (8 or 9 semesters, for instance),
contingent upon acquiring academic
competence, as the University cares
to define it, at a prescribed rate. With
this condition, there ought to be no
great difference from the present
situation—except that the incentive to
learning is a carrot and not a stick.

I do not really know how to argue
very closely for the carrot over the
stick, except to state a belief which
seems to be widespread among teach-
recognized stature. The most
effective teaching is accomplished
when the initiative comes from the
student, when his desire to learn pro-
ceeds from his own positive values.
Forced learning is painful to student
and to teacher, it is wasteful, it re-
sults in narrow perspective and failure
of imagination,

There may be such a difference,' that is punitive rather than

Wicker describes breakdown in relinance upon institutions,

Quality Of Life Said
‘To Be New Concentration

New York Times columnist Tom
Wicker said here yesterday that the
country’s political concentration has
shifted from the standard of living
to the quality of life.

Wicker, an associate editor of the
Fimes and author of its widely sydni
cated “In the Nation” column, said
poverty i sthe concern of an interest
group rather than the dominant politi-
cal force it once was as more and
more Americans are in the affluent
category.

The political questions now center
on education, air pollution and “the
kind of water the fish, not to men-|
tion our children, swim in,” Wicker

said.

He the events of the 1968)
political election had pointed out
changes in the country and its politi-
cal structure, principally a breakdown
in the upon institutions,

said

reliance

He pointed to third party move-
ments and the campaigns of senators
Eugene McCarthy and Robert Ken-
nedy as representative of an increas-
ing loss of confidence in the ability
of governments on all levels to get
the job done.

McCarthy was an “anti-organiza-
tion, anti-institutional, candidate who
was against the biggest institution of
them all—the federal government,”
Wicker said.

He added that MeCarthy was an
effective television performer, an in-

 

creasingly important attribute in a
time that is going through revolu- |
tions in education, communication!

and technology.

Wicker said a political candidate is
almost forced to work as an individual
as much as party candidates because
of polls and television. The polls
dictate to him what his constituency
wants and he must not lambaste the
other party since a large portion of
his audience probably belongs to that
party

He said the two major parties can
no longer build their structure around
the polar bases of farm and city
and predicted that they “would be-
come more and more instruments for
the transfer of power.”

Wicker said these parties would be
neutral on ideological
making it necessary for third parties
to provide ideological emphasis

Wicker also predicted an era of
one-term presidents. He said there is

most issties,

too much questioning of all institu-
tion for the president to control a

party as he has in the past

He added that the opposition has
a better forum because of television
and that “life becoming in
finitely more complex that the job is
just getting to be too hard.”

Wicker said that man’s intellectual
individualism been enhanced
the same time that he feels his dignity
taken by the “massive
of life. He said that people

R-t Phi: Would you comment on

and the effect on it President Nixon
will have?

Wicker: Well | haven't seen any
recent progress toward racial equality
and my view of the Nixon administra-
tion so far is that it is not likely to
take us very much farther toward
racial equality. To be fair about it,
I think it may be possible that for a
while the Nixon administration may
have a soothing effect on the whole
boiling controversy, but I think that
will be limited at best.

I think we deluded ourselves—we
see now we deluded ourselves—al-
though many a hard fight had been
fought in the past for legal action of
one kind or another, for civil rights
laws as such. And now we have a
wide variety of that kind of legisla-
tion. I don’t suggest that we have
enough, but we have enough of it

 

to know that that by itself, legisla
tion, really doesn't get the job done,
and we have got have much
progress within private — institutions

and in local communities.

There is so much to be done; so
little effort being made to get any
of it done; so much complacency; so

much sheer resistance to the enormity

proach of the Nixon administration

R-t Phi: Recently, you wrote a book
on Presidents Johnson and Kennedy,
could you contrast the political style
of the Johnson Administraion and
that of the Richard Nixon so far?

Wicker: | would think the major
difference between the two so far in

style and technique would be that
Nixon is obviously will not be so
activist in terms of either domestic

or foreign policy as Mr, Johnson was.
That is to say, he will not go looking
for trouble quite as much as Presi-
dent Johnson did, he will not try to
inject the powers of the presdency
into

every matter that arises or in
sO many matters that arise. He will
much more nearly try to let other

forces work in American
rather than have every

solution be

R-t Phi: At the same time you
might say there is basic dichotomy of
opinion between Mr, Nixon and his
own cabinet. While Mr. Nixon talks of
a consultation between nations, Mr,
Laird seeks a confrontation. At least
this is the impression I have gotten

Wicker: Yes, that is certainly the
impression you would derive from the
stated view of the two men so far,
am not sure that it is a correct
impression. | am not sure there is
that much difference between them.
I am not that sure that history will
show that Mr. Nixon is quite that
committed to, to use his own phrase,
“consultation,” or Laird is quite that
eager for “confrontation,” The Presi-
dent seems to feel somehow that the
Soviets very anxious for arms
limitations for instance and therefore,
if that’s the case, then maybe we
might agree at a price. That in my
view is not really a long stride to-
ward the era of consultation.

Laird, on the other hand, I think

EC Announces
Successful Vote
On Amendments

A comprehensive report on the
Honor System was unanimously
adopted by the Executive Committee
Wednesday night. The report, print-
ed in full on page two, is designed
to cover all phases of the Honor
System but was issued particularly in
response to questions about jurisdic-
tion and the rights of the accused.

President Jay Passavant announced
at the meeting that Constitutional
amendments clarifying election pro-
cedures and delineating responsibili-
ties of officers were approved in the
referendum March 26 by a vote of
748 to 61.

Committeemen Pete Hendricks and
Stamen Ogilvie were appointed to in-
vestigate the relationship of the Law
School to the EC. They will seek to
determine which student activities
should be jointly conducted by the

Passavant expressed concern that
the Lexington City Council may re
quire students who operate cars to
buy city licenses. The Attorney Gen
eral of Virginia has issued an opinion
that such a tax is legal. The amount
would probably be $8-$10. Passavant
plans to meet with Mayor Douglas

national professional journalism so-
ciety, elected him as the University’s

outstanding journalism student dur-
ing his senior year.
President Huntley also announced

that John Hughes, 35, a member of
the University’s public relations staff

since 1965, has been named Curator
of Lee Chapel and Lee Chapel Mu-
seum, and Sports Information Di-
rector,

[he appointments are effective
April 28, when Holland joins the
University staff.

President Huntley said both ap-

pointments are “extremely important
and timely” for W&L. He described
Holland as a “highly-respected and
highly-competent newsman whose
work with the Richmond Times-Dis-
patch has established him as one of
the most knowledgeable and versatile
writers on educational matters in Vir-
ginia.

“We believe Mr. Holland will bring
a distinctive talent to us at a time
when the role of private higher edu-
cation needs to be interpreted with

new clarity and vigor,” President
Huntley said.

President Huntley cited Hughes’
experience in sports news and his

interest in University history and Lee
Chapel memorabilia as a unique
combination of qualifications needed
by WAL.

“Mr. Hughes’ new duties will permit
Washington and Lee to do a better
job than ever before in supporting
its broad inter-collegiate athletic pro-
gram’s requirements in publicity and
promotion,” President Huntley
“At the same time, we hope to give
proper attention to the supervision
and promotion of activities at Lee
Chapel where so many visitors come
each year.”

A graduate of Richmond's Douglas
S. Freeman High School, Holland
was the Lexington area correspondent
for the Times-Dispatch while a stu
dent here. After graduation, he be-
came the newspaper's bureau
at Farmville, Va., covering ten South
side counties. While there he became
author of “The Story of the Prince
Edward Free Schools,” a booklet
copywrighted by the Prince Edward
Free Schoo! Association, the organiza-
tion which provided schooling for the
county's Negro children in 1953-54.

Initial Free Forum
Set For Tomorrow

Tomorrow at 2:00, two discussion
groups will meet for the first session
of the Free Forum. Topics for dis-
cussion will be “Is God Dead?” and
“Government vs. Business.” Profes-
sors John Mehl, James Leyburn and
John Fielder will participate in the
“Is God Dead?” discussion, while Dr.
Charles Phillips will head the “Gov-
ernment vs. Business” forum.

At the EC meeting on March 24,
a committee was composed to evaluate
topics for discussion and to choose

several for presentation. Committee
members Steve Sandler, Judson Sim-
mons and Lawrence McConnell ex-
plored several possibilities, but ar-
rived at the two mentioned above
for the Free Forum.

“Is God Dead?”

Ihe “Is God Dead?” forum will
be headed by Mr. Mehl who will
moderate student and faculty dis-
cussion, while Dr. Leyburn and Mr.

Fielder will present two aspects of
the current philosophy. Dr. Leyburn
will present the sociological signific-
ance of the philosophy, while Mr.
Fielder will discuss its philosophical
impact briefly. After ten minutes of

of U. S. Foreign Policy Should
Be Significantly Curtailed.” The topic
is sO broad that considerable prepra-
ration must be made in advance.
Speaking practice came during a
special debate here Wednesday with
the University of Virginia team of
Brad Jackson and John Cody. Coach
Chaffin arranged the meet so both

; teams could polish the arguments they

will present at the national meet.
This is the third year and the
second in a row that WAL debate
teams have qualified for the prestigi-
ous national tournament. A 1963 team
posted a 4-4 mark. Last year’s team
did not compete after team member
Tommy Baremore drowned in an
accident the day after he qualified.
[he resetarch going into the pre-

paration for suc ha tournament is

extensive. The terms must be prepar-
ed to argue from either negative or

files for either eventuality

Their sources include Senate hear
ing transcripts, government publica
tions, books on foreign policy, news

magazines, etc. “Through reasearch,
we will be trying to find new aru-

ments.”

 

presentation, Mr. Mehi plans to open
the discussion the students and
faculty present. The Forum will meet
in duPont Auditorium.

Mr. Mehl said that he planned to
“analyze ways in which the popular
‘God is Dead’ slogan is used today.
Among the various questions that will
be raised are whether God is a
factor in the cultural life of our
nation and the question of the use
of ‘God-talk’ in describing the mean-
ing of human existence.”

to

“Government ys. Business”

Although apparently a broader
topic, “Government vs. Business” will
be concerned with contemporary  is-
sues in governmental regulation of
business and will be held in Newcomb
8. Dr. Phillips plans to lead a dis-
cussion this week on the SEC and
its recent regulations on the actions
of the stock market.

Dr. Phillips described his discus-
sion an . Opportunity to raise
issues that would not ordinarily be
raised in the classroom. I hope this
forum will be a springboard to the
pursuit of issues than can’t possibly
be handled in a course of study.
Also, I think that this is the type of
program we need—one that makes
available to students topics that they

The Honor System Report Adopted By The EC

[The following is a reproduction of the report
recently adopted by the Executive Committee, The
report was a result of the extensive studies by the
Sub-Committees on the Honor System, the Bitch-In,
and a thorough discussion within the Executive
Committee itself. The information presented here
will be bound in booklet form and distributed to
all members of the student body to serve as a
reference for all matters concerning the Honor
System. Any major changes from the old Honor
System and new clarifications will be noted in bold
face.]

I. Explanation

Phe Honor System of Washington and Lee University
is based on a sole principle: “a man shall conduct
himself as a gentleman at all times.” It is important to
understand that the System is completely student-
administered and concerned solely with those offenses
which are considered as dishonorable by the student
generation involved. Because the system is in essence
a system of honorable conduct, it can not be specifically
codified in every respect; lying, cheating, and stealing
are however, clearly infringements of the Honor System,
and the result of any such offense will be permanent
dismissal from the University. Each student should
realize that any case presented to the Executive Com-
mittee as a possible honor violation will be investigated.
The nature of the facts evaluated will determine whether
or not the case should be referred to one of the EC
standing committees (including the Publications Board
and the Dance Board) rather than to the EC itself. In
those cases designated to go to the EC as a possible
honor violation, only a lack of sufficient evidence will
be cause for voting not to hold an Honor Hearing.

Every student at Washington and Lee has two major
responsibilities to the Honor System. He must conduct
himself as a gentleman at all times and equally im-
portant, he must report any suspected violation of the
System by another student to the Executive Committee
of the Student Body. A student who witnesses or learns
of a violation of the Honor System and fails to report
the violation is himself guilty of a breach of the System.
It is imperative that everyone recognize this duty of
protecting the Honor System and the Student Body.
Loyalty to the student body demands that one report
the violation to the Executive Committee. This can in
no way be construed as policing or tale-bearing; rather,
it is the finest expression of loyalty to a cherished tradi-
tion of honor among a community of self-governing
students.

A student suspected of an honor violation by the
Executive Committee will face a hearing before that
body. This group, duly elected by the students, represents
University student opinion and is in no way responsible
to the faculty or administration. It is their responsibility
to hear all cases and to render verdicts based upon the
evidence presented. All proceedings are confidential

Upon a verdict of guilty by the Executive Com-
mittee, a student who believes himself innocent may
appeal his case to a Student Body Hearing with a jury
of twelve students selected at random from the student
body. The proceedings of this hearing are open to the
view of the student body. The verdict of the Student
Body jury is final, either reversal of the Executive Com-
mittee decision (not guilty) or corroboration of their
decision (guilty). A guilty penalty will result in dis-
missal from the University.

The Executive Committee earnestly discourages the
use of pledges in all matters of minor concern. The
use of a man’s word of honor to regulate trivialities is
dangerous and should certainly be avoided. The written
pledge used in classes on quizzes, examinations, written
problems and papers means that the work which the
student hands in to his professor is his own, which
he himself has done in accordance with the requirements
of the course as laid down by the professor. The faculty
will co-operate in establishing a clear understanding of
these requirements. However, any work handed in for
credit toward a grade will be considered pledged unless
specifically stated otherwise. In any case of doubt as to
the nature or extent of a pledge, the student should

It must be understood tthat no violation of the
Honor System is too small to report. A violation of
the principle of honor, no matter what the degree, is
a breach of the system. One of the greatest dangers to
which an Honor System can be exposed, however, is
that of being “overloaded” with offenses. To avoid this,
and to preserve inviolate a precious heritage, It is
essential that the Honor System shall concern itself
solely with those offenses which are classified dishonor-
able by the public opinion of the student
involved. Hence, there must things
hensible and heartily condemned by the Executive Com-
mittee and all good citizens which still can not be
brought under the Honor System, Among such except-
ions are breaches of social rules and administrative
regulations, failure to pay honest debts, and breaches of
civil contracts, Such offenses fall under the jurisdiction
of other arms of authority at Washington and Lee.

New students especially should take every opportunity
of acquainting themselves with the workings of the
System in detail as well as these general principles.

IL. Procedure of
EC Hearing

I, Procedure to be Used in the Preliminary lnvestiga-
tion and Initial Presentation of the Executive Committee:
A Any Executive Committee member receiving in

formation indicating that an Honor System violation

may have been committed shall report that fact to
the President of the Student Body, The President
and any one of two members of the Executive Com-
mittee chosen by the President shall investigate the
reported violation, If any two of this group feel
that there is sufficient evidence of a possible violation
of the Honor System, the President of the Student

Hody shall immediately refer the matter to the

Faccutive Committee
ih. If the Executive Commitice feels upon this informa

tion or upon the testimony of witnesses that there

is sufficient evidence of an Honor System violation
to justify a further proceeding, they may by a ma-
jority vote of the Committee in office vote to hold

» hearing. Ten of the twelve PC members must he

present to hold the hearimg

C. If a hearing is deemed necessary all witnesses must
be contacted by the Executive Committee prior to
5:00 p.m. the day of the hearing.

D. The accused student must be informed of his status
with a brief description of the offense involved (time,
location and nature) no later than 5:00 p.m. of the
day of the hearing, but not before 4:00 p.m, the
same day. Under exceptional circumstances, the
accused may be given a period of time beyond the
normal two-hour period of notice before his hear-
ing; this amount shall be subject to the approval
of the President of the Executive Committee, Upon
notification of the accused, he will be informed of
his rights and a statement indicating that he under-
stands his rights and the forthcoming procedure must
be signed prior to the hearing.

E. The Executive Committee hearing will begin at 7:00
p.m. on the same day that the accused is notified
or for good reason, at the President’s discretion.

F, Just prior to the beginning of the hearing, the Vice-
President of the Executive Committee shall inform
the accused of his rights.

Il. Procedure for Honor System Hearings by the
Executive Committee of the Student Body:

A. When the suspected student appears before the

Executive Committee the President shall say to him:
“Information has come to the Executive Com.
mittee indicating that you may have violated
the Honor System in that... (here state briefly
a description of the alleged violation as be-
fore)...and now you are to have a hearing
before the Executive Committee of the Student
Body.”

1. In addition he shall be told that the purpose of
the Committee is to ascertain the facts of the
case and not to prosecute him, that he may call
witnesses who possess pertinent information con-
cerning the matter, and that the Vice-President
of the student body shall be his technical advisor.
Finally he will be reminded that he does not
have to testify and that if he chooses to do so
in this hearing, he must also do so in the event
of a public honor hearing, and that any recording
of testimony may be used by the Executive
Committee in the event of a subsequent public
hearing and may be introduced by the Executive
Committee at any time and for any reason.

B. The accused student shall be permitted to remain
present throughout the questioning of witnesses and
all other proceedings of the Executive Committee
hearing except the deliberation of the Executive Com-
mittee which can occur at any time.

C. The Executive Committee shall request to appear
before it as a witness any person who it feels has
information pertinent to the matter being heard.
Testimony may be taken by the President or persons
he may designate in the form of a written statement
signed by the witness and presented to the Executive
Committee. In extra-ordinary circumstances the Ex-

ecutive Committee by a majority vote may accept
an oral statement (not heard in direct testimony).

D. The witnesses are informed of their status and kept
separate from each other and from the student
suspected unless the Executive Committee for good
reason decides otherwise.

E. When a witness is called before the Committee the
President shall say to him:

“You have been called here solely as witness
in the investigation of a possible honor viola-
tion. Take all the time you need to answer
the questions that the members of the Com-
mittee will ask you and a restatement of an
unclear question will be made on your re-
quest.”

F. The accused may ask questions of any witnesses only
after the Executive Committee has completed its
questioning. The accused may call any witness bear-
ing pertinent information to the case.

G. The President, as presiding officer, shall regulate the
order and nature of the questioning. The Secretary
of the Student Body shall tape record all testimony
of the hearing.

H. After the hearing of all evidence the Executive
Committee shall go into executive session to consider
the matter. If it is apparent that nothing further can
be gained from questioning the individual involved
in the case and if there is no further discussion
desired by the Committee the President shall then
declare a brief intermission during which time he
and those designated by him shall each prepare a
resume of pertinent matters bearing on the hearing
taking special pains to set forth an unbiased sum-
mary.

1. The President shall call the committee to order, at
which time the summaries will be presented. After
the summaries a vote shall then be taken by secret
ballot. The President shall instruct the Committee
that each member in voting shall resolve any reason-
able doubt in favor of the suspected. If two-thirds of
the Committee vote guilty, the suspect is found
guilty of a breach of the Honor System.

J. The President shall pronounce to the suspected stu-
dent the determination of the committee. If the
determination of the committee is that the student
violated the Honor System he shall be informed that
the decision of the Executive Committee shall be
final unless within 24 hours he makes a written request
for a Student Body Hearing which, if requested,
will be held in accordance with the procedure estab-
lished by the Executive Committee. The time for
making such a request may be extended in particular
cases in the discretion of the Executive Committee.

K. Upon the announcement to the student of the de-
termination of the committee he shall be accompanied
by two or more members of the Executive Com-
mittee appointed by the President until his departure
from the town of Lexington or until he has requested
a Student Body Hearing within the prescribed time.

L. Upon the expiration of the time within which a Stu-
dent Body Hearing may be requested if no request
is made an announcement shall be placed on the
bulletin boards of the university by the Secretary to
the effect that

“A member of the Student Body has been
found guilty of a violation of the Honor Sys-
tem involving (lying, cheating. stealing, or
knowing of and failing to report a violation),”

M. A hearing may be re-opened upon the production
of new evidence directly bearing on the question
quilt or innecence or to prevent injustices, The
required to re-open a hearing must be equal to
number of FC members who heard the
testimony minus seven; only those EC members f

tw

trit

the initial hearing may vote. Any person seeking to

reopen a hearing shall appear before the Executive

Committee and state the nature of the evidence.

The committee shall then consider whether the

evidence is sufficiently relevant to warrant a re-

hearing. If a hearing is re-opened it shall be entirely
re-heard.

In the event that an accused student seeks to remain

a part of the University without coming to the hear-

ing in face of an honor violation, the hearing will

be conducted in his absence and an indication of
his refusal to testify will be made.

O. Should a student leave the community in face of
a suspected honor violation his permanent record
shall state that he withdrew from the University
without securing official permission and a note made
to the effect that he was facing charges of an honor
violation, After leaving the community he will be
located and notified by the Executive Committee that
he has forty-eight (48) hours in which to return and
face the hearing or his record will be noted as above.
No trial will be heard if he remains outside the
community.

P. If the accused is declared innocent, all evidence and
records of the trial shall be immediately destroyed.
If the accused is declared guilty, a permanent sum-
mary of the case will be made by the Secretary in
addition to the tape recording. All such information
is considered highly confidential.

III. Rights of the Accused

li

F. A right to examine all exhibits presented during the
hearings.

G. A right to elect to be tried separately when the
accused is one or two or more involved in a joint
violation. If none of those accused in an alleged
joint offense request separate trials, they may be
tried jointly or separately, as determined by the
Executive Committee.

H. A right to request an appeal of a guilty verdict from
the Executive Committee to a Student Body Hearing
under the following conditions:

1) The request must be presented in writing with-

Golfers Beat UR;
Meet H-S Today

By DAVE OLSON

This afternoon the Washington and
Lee Golf Team teed off against
Hampden-Sydney at the Boonsboro
Country Club in Lynchburg. The
Generals hoped to record their sec-
ond win against no losses after
Tuesday’s victory over Richmond (12-
9).

In Tuesday's match at the Lexing-
ton Golf Club, W&L was led by
junior Dick Singletary, who shot a
75 playing in the number two posi-
tion. He was followed by Ken Carter,
who had a 76, and Jim Gordon, who
shot a 78. Captain Gary Silverfield,
seniors Bill MeCleod, and Bob Mat-
thews, and freshman Bill Martin all
contributed to the W&L win. Last
year’s seventh man, sophomore John
Gunner, will be unable to play for
about a week due to a knee injury
incurred over spring vacation.

With last year’s top seven back
and the introduction of six freshmen,
the prospects for this season and for

Win Over EMC

By WALT POTTER

W&L’s “Hurrin’ Harriers” started
off their season in devasting fashion
Thursday afternoon by thoroughly
trouncing Eastern Mennonite, 103-42,
on rain dampened Wilson Field.

The General trackmen shook off
the intermittent showers of the gloomy
day to build up a commanding lead
in the field events and then put it
away with strong performances in
the running events.

record highlighted the Big Blue's
performance in the field events. Bill
Kahn took the long jump and triple
jump with leaps of 19° 10” and 40’
104", respectively, and Robbie Faust
won the rain shortened pole vault at
10 feet and tied for the high jump
victory with teammates John Glace
and Mike Neer at 5’ 6”. Doug Deaton
broke his own school mark in the
discuss with a toss of 142’ 66”, as
well as taking third in the shot put.
Ben Williams captured first in the
shot with a heave of 43’ 6”. He
also took a second in the discus.
Max Brantly, another promising
freshman, completed the Generals’
sweep of the two events with a third
in the discus and a second in the
shot.

The javelin throwers rounded out
the W&L dominance of the field
events with another sweep as Mike
Carrere, Charlie Freret, and Jay
Passavant captured the first three
places, respectively.

In the running events co-captain
Sam Hinkle led the way. Hinkle won
the 440 yard run in 51.9, ran the
anchor leg on the winning 440 yard
relay team, and almost pulled another
win for the Big Blue in the mile
relay by making up 20 yards in
his leg to almost catch the Eastern
Mennonite harrier.

Drew Thomas excelled for W&L
in the hurdles by winning the inter-
mediate 440 yard hurdles event and
copping a second in the 120 yard
highs. In the distances Harry Zelif
turned in another strong perform-
ance, picking up two second place
finishes behind two very strong East-
ern Mennonite runners, who ran
times of 9:44.1 and 4:35.7 in the
two mile and mile respectively. Bob
Jensen rounded out the fine General
performance in the distance events
posting a 2:03 time in winning the
half mile.

The Washington and Lee baseball

p.m. against Oneonta State after suf-
fering an unhappy homecoming from
Florida Tuesday.

In the Tuesday contest, W&L man-
aged only one hit off Emory and
Henry ace righthander Fred Wagner.
The hit came in the sixth inning
when Jack Baizley ran his hitting
streak to four games. Baizley’s hit
kept alive a short rally that later
scored John Nolan for W&L’s lone
run, However, this was not enough
to overcome a three-run Emory and
Henry lead. The final score was 3-1,

Students, Girls, Factulty Members
Eligible To Compete In Contest

The Third Annual Ring-tum Phi-
sponsored Goshen Classic Tubing
Contest will be held Saturday, April
26, according to an announcement
made this week by meet director
Jerry Perlman.

In announcing the date of the
event, Perlman said that additional
information concerning the contest
would be released shortly, although
he did say that only one major
change in its format has been in-
troduced,

The Classic will once again be held
on the tricky 2.3 mile course at
Goshen Pass on the Maury River,
navigated last year in the record time
of 32:00 minutes by Ed Mathews of
Newport News.

Like last year, the contest will
once more consist of three separate
events: the President’s Trophy Race
for members of the Washington and

Lee faculty and administration; the
Powderpuff Sweepstakes for girls
only; and the Downriver Grand

Slalom, which, for the first time, will
be open to students from all NCAA
colleges and universities.

ful spring trip in many years last
week. The team compiled a 3-2 record
in games against three different
schools,

In the first game on Saturday,
March 29, Wilmington College (N.C.)
defeated the Generals, 2-0, on a three-

hitter. However, W&L bounced back
on Monday to defeat Florida Pres-
byterian College, 9-5, as the home

team made eight errors.

Tuesday, April 2, the Generals
split a doubleheader, losing to Aurora
College of Illinois, 5-1, in the first
game and winning the second game
against Florida Presbyterian, 7-1. In
the morning contest the baseballers
lost the services of co-captain Thom

Mitchell for about two weeks. Mit-
chell sustained a tendon injury.
Before his injury, Mitchell had |

run his pitching record to 2-1 with

his outstanding win against Florida
Presbyterian the day before. Fresh-
man right-hander Bill Miller got

credit for Tuesday's win over Florida
Presbyterian, going all the way while

Committee Rejects Exam Proposal

The faculty, meeting last Monday
night, rejected the proposal of Staman
Ogilvie to institute an independent
exam schedule. The motion, had it
carried, would have provided for the
selection by students, within reason-
able bounds, of the time and date
when they would take their various
final examinations.

system will sponsor a production of
Kay Britten’s “In Search of Dylan”

According to Dean Pusey, the mo-
tion was defeated only after the
faculty had given “careful considera-
tion to the pros and cons of the pro-
posal.”

Ogilvie was present at the meeting
by invitation, and presented a state-
ment, after which he was questioned
by various members of the faculty.
Following this, the vote was taken.
Had the motion carried, it would not
have gone into effect until the first
semester of next year.

BLACK UNITY

The Lexington High School Student
Organization for Black Unity will
present “The Black Voice,” a black
musical production this weekend. The
Troubadour Theatre will host three
performances tonight and Saturday
night at 8:00 and Sunday afternoon
at 4:30. Admission will be fifty cents,

The performances, entirely student
directed and cast, include both poetry,

music, and dance selected by the
students as representative of black
culture.

Prior publication in the form of
posters, which had been distributed
around the campus earlier this week,
mysteriously disappeared a short time
after being put up.

‘The way

I see it’

(Editor's note: “The way I see it”
is a column of general editorial
comment for which contributions
are solicited from students and
faculty concerning any topic.)

By JIM HAMILL

No subject is approached with more
trepidation as Spring arrives than a
defense of W&L against those who
favor coeducation. One recent colum-
nist of the “Phi” has rather safely
observed that girls add to the aesthetic
character of the campus. Not to
wholeheartedly agree with this senti-
ment would be foolhardy. But what-
ever the merits of this kind of wish-
ful-thinking, there are more pragmatic
issues to be met if we carry coeduca-
tion beyond the phase of wish ful-
fiillment.

This article suggests a second look
at coeducation. It argues that coeduca-
tion will require a whole new defini-

tion of what W&L is or what in
strives to be. Lusty student voices in
favor of an immediate deluge of
women should not be thought to

justify coeducation without considera-
tion of some of the inherent difficul-
ties.

A few central presumptions have
characterized W&L’s reputation, and
these are neither surprising nor often
contested. We have traditionally never
seen ourselves as the end of the
education process, but as a kind of
preparatory school for postgraduate
training. One has only to point to the
percentage of graduates who become
professional people—lawyers,  busi-
nessmen, professors, and more re-
cently, doctors. In other words, Wash-
ington and Lee is by and large an
institution for men who intend to
become professionals in these fields
after some graduate education at
another institution, Of the graduates
of the School of Commerce and Ad-
ministration, some 75 per cent eventu-
ally continue their education, and for
the University as a whole, the per-
centage is at least 50 per cent. Law
school is the leading choice for both
groups.

The correlation between this and
the issue of coeducation lies in an
examination of how many women fit

into this kind of definition of Wash-!

ington and Lee. Isolating statistics of
those attending graduate schools in
business and law, one gets evidence
of the male dominance in graduate
education, In seven so-called prestigi-
ous business graduate schools (Co-
lumbia, Cornell, Harvard, Michigan,
Northwestern, Pennsylvania, and
Stanford), there are enrolled $533 men
and 126 women (2.2 per cent). Choos-
ing five equally eminent law schools
(Harvard, Michigan, New York Uni
versity, Stanford and Yale), one finds

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Mass student voice needed to catch faculty ear

By STAMAN OGILVIE
Sophomore Executive Committeeman

Student opinion is a strange com-
modity on the W&L campus. You
hear it breathed in the Co-op over
coffee or dealt with lightly in the
fraternity houses over choice ale or
propounded twice weekly in the
Ring-tum Phi or surveyed searchingly
in late night dorm sessions. But try
to get quantitative measure of stu-
dent opinion and it is as manifest as
a lipstick trace on the back of Gov-
ernor Wallac’s neck. In short, here-
tofore we have rarely been able to
martial indicative student sentiment
in quantitative terms.

Today we have a new situation, a
new responsibility, and, | think, a
new impetus to action. Faculty mem-
bers, in their recent vetoing of the
E.C.’s_ independent exam schedule
proposal, expressed sentiment that in
light of the amount of revision that
has been proposed and accepted in
all areas of campus affairs this year
they would be interested in: 1) stu-
dent response to the tack the Uni-
versity has taken and 2) measurable
student support for future action, a
response that should have a broader
base than the opinion of twelve Ex-
ecutive Committeemen and several
newspaper columnists. All of the pre-
ceding sentence-book being a long-
winded euphemism which translates:
no one in faculty or administration is
absolutely sure that what we of the
E.C, say you say is really your sayso.

Enter the reports of the faculty and
student Curriculum Committees.
Months of work and consideration
have gone into the preparation of the
plan (copies of which have been
dirceted to your fraternity house, the
Co-op, and the Commons). It outlines
possible revisions in the university
calendar, graduation requirements,
and distribution guidelines, As you
know, it suggests the innovation of a
short semester to fall in the middle
or at the end of the year for the
purpose of independent in-depth study
which would better tailor education
experience to the benefit and chal-
lenge of individual students. It recom-
mends conversion to the type system
that other schools all over the country
are using to attract the highest quality
high school graduates,

With regard to distribution, the
Curriculum Committee has published
a majority and a minority opinion
both of which call for a reclassifica-
tion of courses into four divisions.
The minority proposal calls for more
rigid adherence to distribution re-
quirements, requiring 46 credits as
contrasted with the majority's 36
credit minimum suggestion. Toe de-
velop adequate expertise for the
further discussion of the plans re-
quires careful reading of the brief
four and one-half page printed sum-
mary which you should have.

Today's R-tP presents some interest-
ing data on this and other current
subjects of interest. But as always
before, the students response to Mon-
day's poll was disappointing in mass
terms. Those who did respond ex-
pressed a clear-cut preference for a
short term and mixed reaction to-
ward distribution requirements (this
latter due in part to a lack of informa-

 

tion on the specifics of the Curriculum
Committee proposals). The Tuesday
Ring-tum Phi has taken the logical
first step in stirring slumbering stu-
dent opinion.

Now here are some candid facts
that had better elicit a little adrenalin
secretion. The faculty is awfully tired
of trying to better academic oppor-
tunities for a student body that will
not express its opinions on change.
I sensed this in an independent exam
session with them last Monday. The
curriculum revisions that general
sentiment favors will be defeated if
we do not take a meaningful and
unified position in their favor. With
student demand the proposal will
pass. It’s as simple as that.

Washington and Lee University has
nothing attractive to offer prospective
students unless it is the personal at-
tention to academic needs that our
size permits us, In 1969 American
education has progressed to a point
where modified distribution require-
ments and short term independent
study are necessary for the most re-
warding educational — experiences.
Look and see where the college ap-
plications are going. It’s alarming.
Our current system fetters the indi-
viduality of education that we are
capable of offering.

 

You may have voted yesterday in
the Ring-tum Phi poll. Good. But
I ask you to do this, Take the printed
report and read it over for several
minutes. Discuss its implications with
friends. This issue is vital enough
that you will want to be fully in-
formed to make a decision. Thurs-
day when you vote for the Big
Four offices, take time to mark the
accompanying ballot concerning cur-
riculum revision, The E.C. will sum-
marize the results and present them
directly and personally to each faculty
member, Student opinion can be the
decisive factor in modernizing W&L
curriculum. We always cry for an
enhanced position in the decision-
making process. Well, what we have
here is an opportunity to take an
enhanced position in the decision-
making process. Curriculum revision
will affect many of us in the uni-
versity now. It will unquestionably
determine the success or failure of
Washington and Lee’s future. This
is the most important question that
will confront the university while we
are here. To shirk our responsibility
in creating a stronger Washington
and Lee is to admit the decease of
student opinion and competence. Vote
on Thursday,

 

Rock-gospel to come

To the ordinary Washington and
Lee student, it might seem that
Springs weekend and the University
Federation of Christian Concern don’t
exactly go hand in hand, but the
UFOCC is out to prove him wrong.
In a rather unprecedented step, the
Federation is bringing a rock-gospel
group to Lexington for a Saturday
afternoon concert. At 4:30 in the
afternoon when some students are re-
turning with their dates from Goshen,
and others are whiling away the
time before dinner, the “Sons of
Thunder” will begin their concert on
the lawn in front of Lee Chapel.

The concert is the latest of several
innovations and programs launched
by the Federation. It is seen as an
opportunity to entertain the students
and their dates, make them aware of
the UFOCC and its mission, and to
impart a religious note to the week-
end.

The “Sons of Thunder” is a mixed
group made up of three men and
two girls, all students in either the
D.C. area or in North Carolina.
Their professionalism, however, is un-
questionable. The group has cut sev-
eral albums and made a great many
concert tours, They write all of their
own songs, and do their own arrang-
ing. Both men, Blaine Smith and Don
Williamston were formerly members
of the “Newports.”

While their sound is typical of a
modren rock group, their lyrics are
concerned with the relevance of relig-
ion in their lives and in the world
today. As Smith points out, “Our
music, which is all original, is drawn
from popular rock and folk. Our
purpose is to use the medium of
popular music to discuss not only

 

Virginia Museum play on Dylan

Thomas shouldn’t be passed up

The performance of “In Search of
Dylan,” to be presented in Lee Chapel
Thursday night, gives the Washing-
ton and Lee student a rare opportunity
to see a first class professional drama.
“In Search of Dylan,” a presentation
of The Virginia Museum, is cur-
rently on a month-long tour of the
state that will take it to 21 com-
munities, The play opened to an en-
thusiastic crowd in Richmond, April
;

“In Search of Dylan” is a biography
of the talented but tragic poet Dylan
Thomas. The play traces his life from
his boyhood days in Wales, through
his productive years, age 16-19 when
he wrote most of his poetry, to his
dissolution in his later years.

The play gives the audience both
an insight into the works of the poet
and a study in self-destruction of a
man who literally drank himself to
death.

The story line of the play, the
rise and fall of Thomas, is unfortu-
nately broken by two innovations
thrown in at the end.

A scene from Thomas’ highly suc-
cessful play “Under Milkwood” is
presented near the end of the play,
at a time that it ruins the sequence
of events by causing too great an
interruption. After the Richmond per-
formance, director Frederick Rolf
indicated that the scene might either
be done earlier or eliminated com-
pletely. li is hoped that the scene
can somehow be saved because if
gives a good insight into Thomas

The play ends with a unique tse

 

Although interesting and indeed mov-
ing, this scene cannot avoid the
stigma of superficiality.

Until these two divisions, a sharp
and witty script and excellent acting
had lifted the play from one new
height to another,

The cast of four includes Douglas
Watson as Thomas and Kay Britten,
Frank Groceclose and Brian Gilmar
in multiple roles.

Gilmar, an Englishman, gives the
finest performance in taking several
comedy roles, Watson, a veteran of
27 Broadway plays, and Groceclose,
a native Virginian, are also excellent.
Miss Britien, whose roles include
Catlin Thomas, the poet's long-suf-
fering wife, overacts at times.

Miss Britten wrote the play, and
contributes to its success with voice
and guitar, Her drawback as an
actress are compensated for by the
songs she wrote into the script for
herself.

The state is fortunate to have such
an organization as The Virginia Mu-
seum, the nation’s first statewide arts
system. The work of the Museum
should be familiar to the WAL stu-
dent by the frequent appearances in
Lexington of the Artmobile, which is
currently in the city displaying Byzan
tine treasures. The Virginia Museum
also sponsored the appearance of the
Abbey Singers at Lee Chapel earlier
in the year

The chance to see a performance
of the calibre of “In Search of Dylan”

is all too rare in Lexington. Students attitude
with any interest in drama should/ stable wanting a cleansing

of slides and commentary on Thomas, ; not pass 1 up.

current problems of today, but also
to suggest answers for some of them.”

The “Sons of Thunder” have ap-
peared on many major college cam-
puses to date, and on each oc-
casion they were very warmly receiv-
ed. In this area they have given
concerts at Georgetown University,
the University of Maryland, American
University, and High Point College.

Admission to the concert will be
free in order to attract as many
people as possible to a performance
given for their enjoyment and benefit.
Should their reception be as good as
is anticipated the Federation will
likely plan similar concerts with
other groups for various times dur-
ing the next school year.

In the event of inclement weather,
the concert will be given in Lee
Chapel.

Religion is living on WGL
campus in several forms

By GLENN AZUMA
Assistant Editorial-Page Editor

College days are traditionally a
time when home ties are loosened. It
is also a time when the typical college
student drifts from the church of his
parents and his childhood, experi-
menting with others or simply re-
jecting all. For some this action is
conscious and deliberate for others
it is not so easily recognized. In
either case the act seems to be a
natural trend at a natural time. The
question arises: Is the W&L man,
like the typical student, drifting from
religion? This question was directed
to Dr. L. Hodges, Professor of Relig-
ion. Dr. Hodges:

“It seems to me that before such
a question can be taken up the ques-
tion of what religion is must first be
satisfied. | think religion must be

Music clubs’ concerts end

The Washington and Lee Glee
Club and Brass Choir returned Sun-
day night from their annual Spring
Concert Tour. During the course of
the four day trip, the men sang and
played for five different audiences,
one of which was more than one
thousand strong.

At two schools, the men were the
guests of female choirs which had
given concerts at WAL earlier in the
school year. Thursday evening saw
the clubs perform with the female
choir before the student body of
Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa.
After the concert, the men were the
guests of the Wilson Choir as the
girls threw a party for them. Then,
on Saturday, the men joined the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania's “Pennsyng-
ers” (the girls’ choir) in a public
concert on their campus and partied
with them that night.

In between these concerts, the clubs
performed before the more-than-one-
thousand crowd of patients at the
Philadelphia State Hospital, a mental
institution, as well as the student
body of Blair Academy of Blairstown,

held on Sunday evening on the trip
back to Lexington. The clubs stopped
at the Foxcroft School, a girls’ board-
ing school in the deep woods near
Middleburg, Virginia.

The programs given included some
Broadway show tunes, folk songs,
spirituals, religious hymns, and brass
ensembles. In conjuction with the two
girls’ choirs, the men sang Pergolesi's
Magnificat.

The solo singers in the Glee Club
included Alan GaNun, Rick Carson,
Paul Weeks, Dick Thomas, Pete Wil-
son, Bill Graham, and Bill Poole.

In addition to its obvious public
relations purposes, the tour was a
great deal of fun for all those in-
volved. Professors Robert Stewart
and J. Tucker Cook directed and led
the group of sixty WA&L students,
and Vaughn Thomas was the ac-
companist for the Glee Club.

The Spring tour was the only one
made this year. Last year the Glee
Club took two tours. The first was
to Montreal, Canada where they ap-
peared at Expo ‘67, and the second
was to Washington, D.C.

defined largely in terms of what Paul
Tillich has said, that is, a final con-
cern or ultimate commitment.
“Under that definition everybody
at W&L is religious, in that everyone
has some kind of ultimate commit-
ment. Not everyone has a church
commitment, neither does everyone
have a commitment to a traditional
faith. | feel there are many signs
that religion is not at all dead at
WAL, even established religions.
“I've observed in many, many
instances that during the college years
people are doing things other than
attending organized services of wor-
ship. They are not as involved in
church affairs. However, there are
many, many functional substitutes.

“The ultimate concern of most men
is to live in some type of close com-
munity. There are many functional
substitutes for the church, one is the
student body as a whole. We are
members of a de facto community,
we associate with each other.

“We have common interests, com-
mon concerns, having our own com-
mon rituals at athletic events, lec-
tures, university assemblies, and other
various events. Fraternities and other
organizations on campus are func-
tional substitutes for ecclesiastical
bodies. | think you'll find that within
the college these alternative organiza-
tions make the churches seem less
and less necessary.

“In observing men in the under-
graduate school | think they tend to
lose interest in eccesiastical estab-
lishments and get more interested in
other establishments. It is very in-
teresting that the people who are
most rebellious against established
bodies create their own. They pro-
mote fraternities or other organiza-
tions. | think after the college years
people in our culture tend to go back
into a church existence.”

There also exists on campus many
instances of spontaneous religious
attitudes. A few groups in the Fresh-
man Old Dorm meet occassionally
for prayer and meditation. The presi-
dent of the student body, Jay Passa-
vant, and a few of his associates has
organized a “prayer breakfast” with
faculty members, Within the university

establishmentarianism, but a renais-
sunce of those now almost forgotten
virtues of gentlemantliness, which, in
addition to holding one’s liquor might
include honor, and courtesy, and even
amiability and cleanliness. Let us
resurrect, too, the values of scholar-
ship—curiosity, quality, and virtue
(not alphabet) being its own reward.

Some of this Utopia-on-the-Maury
must be subcontracted to the faculty
and administration. The ABC pocket
rule is not the only means of measure-
ment and catechism classes are too
often easy escape taken by our dis-
tinguished lecturers. The ambiance
created by these practices is certainly
not intellectual.

But most blame lies with those who
confuse the holding of power and the
using of it, We students plug our-
selves into institutions and bask in the

ing flies like self-satisfied basilisks,

exists several organizations who are
of a religious nature. One of the
most important of these is the
U.F.O.C.C. (University Federation of
Christian Concern),

In speaking of this organization,
Dr. Hodges said, “We are a voluntary
association of students, faculty and
ministers who are a very loosely
organized institution doing loosely
organized activities.” He went on to
say that the university wishes to ful-
fill the religious needs of the faculty
and students in whatever way it can.
However, it does not wish to initiate
and direct programs unless student
interest is demonstrated. The univer-
sity is prepared to lend financial and
organizational assistance if such an
interest is shown. It is toward such
an end and under such a policy that
these organizations operate in the uni-
versity.

Jim Hamill airs his views on coeducation at Washing and Lee

(Continued from Page 1)

enrolled 4,759 men and 345 women
(6.7 per cent).

The point is that women do not
usually choose to attend graduate
schools in fields W&L emphasizes.
That is to say, women do not want
to pursue careers in law, business,
politics, and medicine. Though it
might be pointed out that fewer
women qualify for admission to these
kinds of graduate schools, it is also
true that in similar analysis of prestigi-
ous graduate schools in education and
art, women constitute a considerable
percentage of those attending. This
invites the observation that men and
women share entirely different inter-
ests for entirely different reasons,

It is also fruitful to take a look
at those fields which do seem to
interest female students. At about
twenty girls’ schools examined, in-
cluding the “Seven Sisters,” and all
those in Virginia, there is a separate
Department of Education, usually one
of the largest departments in the cata-
log. The courses which are offered
aim at producing teachers, advisors
and counselors for primary, second-
ary, and “special” education. Women
traditionally dominate in these fields.
Also, at most of the girls’ schools
studied one finds majors available i in

way through the game the visitors
took the offense. Oneonta State spray-
ed a few balls to the outfield and the
lead changed hands 2-1.

But Oneonta State wasn't through
yet. The visitors exploded for seven
runs in the eighth inning. In the last
two innings W&L staged rallys and
two additional tallys were made. But
these runs were too little too late as
Oneonta posted the win 9-3.

WA&L’s main problem was off and
on pitching. With Thom Mitchell out
the strain seems apparent in the

On Saturday night, the entertain-
ment will be provided by Jerry Butler
and the Magnificient Men. Rumors
that Butler is not going to appear
are unfounded; and the Dance Board
has definite word from his manager
that he will perform here. The Ice
Man will feature his many hits, which
include “Never Gonna Give You
Up,” “Moon River,” and “He Will
Break Your Heart.”

From Pennsylvania, the Magnificent
Men are a well-known soul impres-
sion group. They have appeared at
Myrtle Beach and in New York's
Theater, where they

dance, voice, music, art history, sculp-
ture, painting, and always drama and
speech, This could be said to demon-
strate heavy female interest in the
fine arts fields. While W&L students
enroll in large numbers in fine arts
courses, one suspects that the dif-
ference is that girls tend towards the
partcipatory arts rather than the art
history courses predominating here.
It is true that new emphasis is being
given fine arts at W&L,. Next year
a drama major will be instituted, and
several new courses will be offered.
Still, it can be argued that W&L’s
fine arts program would be hardly
comparable to the extensive and large
programs at most girls’ schools,

| have tried to demonstrate that
women are not interested in the fields
in which W&L traditionally has prid-
ed itself—commerce, pre-law, eco-
nomics, history, and pre-med, all of
these being preparatory to postgradu-
ate education. Girls, who do not
usually seek any postgraduate train-
ing, seem to prefer the arts, humani-
ties, and teacher training, some of
which fields are inadequately repre-
sented at W&L or not represented at
all. There is independent evidence to
support these conclusions. Frederick
B. Rowe, professor of psychology at|

| desirably low
| is because women are satisfied with
|a generalized

acteristics of Woman's College Stu-
dents under the auspices of the South-
ern Regional Education Board. In a
survey of background, environment,
and personality of students at Hollins,
Randolph-Macon, and Sweet Briar,
Dr. Rowe observes:

At all three schools there is little
sign of a practical, vocational, or
pre-professional orientation; rather,
the emphasis seems to be on in-

terest and achievement in the
humanities, social sciences, and
arts. (p. 44).

Comparing girls’ schools to one
another in some detail, a more dis-
turbing condition also was observed
by Dr. Rowe. Rowe gives data in-
dicating a relatively low interest in
scholarship as compared with very
high interest in “friendliness, loyalty,
and group welfare.” As a statement
relative to female attitudes towards
the academic environment, Dr. Rowe’s
conclusions appear to point again to
a lesser interest among women in
the professional life or in postgradu-
ate training characteristic of the em-
phasis of this institution.

Further, a faculty-student commit-
tee at Lindenwood Women’s College
in St. Charles, Missouri, has observed
that women are less inclined than
men to remain at college for a full
four years, which results in an un-
“retention rate.” This

two year education,
decide to get married, or otherwise
enter society at an earlier time than
for men. At Linwood, this four year
atrition is 37 per cent.

It is the belief of this writer that
coeducation will require an almost

| total reorganization of the curriculum

structure, deemphasizing significantly
the role of Washington and Lee as
a postgraduate preparatory school for
professional men in various fields. It
will also require new stress on areas
WAL does not now regard in the
same light as it does pre-law, com-
merce, and pre-med,

Curriculum changes have been
much in the news around W&L, but
I don't think these curriculum de-
bates have centered around a funda-
mental change in the emphasis of
WAL preparatory education as much
as a strengthening of its current em-
phasis. In any event, few could argue
with any certainty or plausibility that
women can be simply fitted into the

present academic structure of W&L,
unless one is speaking of a mere
handful, like the 34 who attend
Harvard Business School with 1830
men, Under the present circumstances,
the really highly qualified women will
apply somewhere else than W&L,
which does not offer what they are
interested in. Those women im will
apply nevertheless may force a low-
ering of admissions standards because
of coeducation for its own sake, If
we speak of real coeducation, let's
also speak of a complete reform of
the curriculum as well as a funda-
mental redefinition of the role of this
university in maintaining high stand-
ards in preparatory training for post-
graduate work. Some would advocate
this kind of change and redefinition,
I would not. It deprives the Uni-
versity of its chief distinction; it
yields prestige and reputation to social
pressure; and it surrenders the func-
tion of the preparatory school for
post-gradutes, making W&L merely
another one of hundreds of “good”
undergraduate small colleges and uni-
versities.

The President's Panel on Higher
Education, headed by McGeorge
Bundy has emphasized the unique
position of the small liberal arts col-
lege. It has pointed towards the need
for these colleges to pursue a dis-
tinct course which differentiates them
from other kinds of institutions. The
panel concludes, in part, “unless the
private college program is significantly
different, it doesn’t deserve to sur-
vive.” Washington and Lee's dis-
tinctive kind of pre-graduate school
preparation for men meets this type
of criteria. Its character in this re-
gard should be retained.

Referendum Results
Support Innovations

Laramie, Wyoming, polled 357 votes
to edge Honig, rising KA senior
from Houston, who had 339. Sandler,
ZBI from Norfolk, had 284, Charley
Whipple, a Beta from Columbia,
South Carolina, came up with 95
write-in votes.

Tompkins, sophomore Executive
Committeeman, and Dobbins, current
President of the Junior Class, both
polled more than 1000 votes. They
had been upopposed throughout the
campaign and their names were alone
on the ballot.

Bass, a rising Sigma Chi senior
from Little Rock, Arkansas, had 386
votes compared to 348 for Coursen,
a Phi Psi junior from Washington.
Neither could obtain a majority due
to the candidacy of Bart Taylor, Phi
Kap law student who received 229
voles as a strong write-in candidate.

Curriculum Changes Upheld

Wasingion and Lee students agreed
by almost 20 to | that the university | -
needs curriculum change as suggested
by the Faculty and Student Curri-
culum Committees. On the question
of calendar changes, 544 expressed
a preference for a 12-12-6 format
with the “independent” study pro-
gram coming at the end of the year.
Ninety-two voted for a 12-6-12 pro-
cedure and 155 favored retention of
the present system. On the subject
of distribution requirements, students
expressed a rather marked interest in
the “majority proposal,” whereby a
minimum of 6 credits would be re-
quired in each of four established
divisions, one could not satisfy both
major and distribution requirements,
and it would be preferable that re-
quirements be fulfilled by the close
of the sophomore year. Over 200 stu-

dents cast ballots in favor of the
“minority” proposal which includes
more stringent distribution require-

ments, and 122 favored the present
system.

Whipple Stoic In Defeat

The large turnout for yesterday's
voting appears to have temporarily
belied the charge of student apathy
that became so apparent during Wed-
nesday’s nighi’s voluntary assembly
for the candidates, Certainly apathy
and disinterest does not appear to
reign in one camp. Charley Whipple,
defeated a write-in candidate in
each of the Big Four Elections, was

as

asked if he intended to pursue his
campaign. “Well, I'm not going to
ask anybody not to vote for me,”

was his answer

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

SWEDE HENBERG

One of the most important issues which
comes up at Washington and Lee is the
annual election of student body officers.

Each year the Wé&L student community
has the opportunity to select the three men
who will serve as its primary leaders. Of these
three, the president in particular has a posi-
tion which enable him to largely determine
the vigor and success of student government.
The strength and character of the leadership
he provides is reflected both in the spirit of
the student body and in the effectiveness of
the Executive Committee as a forum for the
voice of the students.

The responsibilities of the office make it
essential that its holder be a person of genuine
foresight so that he may persue the path of
progress.

For this reason the staff of the Friday
edition of the Ring-tum Phi feels that it is
necessary to speak out on the issue of student
election. In the past few years the Ring-tum
Phi has avoided taking this step. We believe
that this unspoken policy is a mistake. Too
often the newspaper has avoided this and
other questions in an attempt to stay out of
controversy; the fact is that it is the duty and
responsibility of this newspaper to evaluate
the candidates in this or any election and
present our opinions on them.

With this in mind, the staff of this news-
paper was polled individually on the upcom-
ing election. The opinion presented in this
editorial is that expressed by an overwehelm-
ing majority of staff members. It is not the
opinion of its author alone, nor of any other
single person on the Friday edition.

ae % Bd

The Friday Ring-tum Phi believes Swede
Henberg is the more suitable candidate for
student body president. Although both Mr.
Henberg and his opponent Mr. Honig have
excellent qualifications for this office, several
other considerations combine to make Mr.
Henberg more desirable in our eyes.

Chief among these factors is Mr. Hen-
berg’s experience with the Curriculum Com-
mittee. As chairman of that committee he
has done much to further the cause of cur-
riculum reform. Certainly one of the most
crucial issues to come up next year will be
changes in the curriculum, especially if the
faculty adopts a short-term plan. Mr. Hen-
berg’s unique experience gives him except-

ars

ional qualifications to deal effectively with
this issue.

Specifically, Mr. Henberg proposes in his
platform a definite plan to ensure further stu-
dent participation in curriculum changes.
Another proposal is for the setting up of in-
terdepartmental seminars. As he points out,
‘Tt’s time we stopped compartmentalizing
knowledge.”

This indicates another point in Mr. Hen-
berg’s favor: in place of the customary broad
(and meaningless) platitudes expressed in
most platforms, he formularizes concrete plans
of action. Mr. Henberg doesn’t at all speak
in the “we’ve-got-to-do-something-about-this
(but I don’t know what) manner” so com-
mon among candidates for any office.

Nor do all of Mr. Henberg’s plans deal
with the curriculum. A study of other parts of
his platform reveals how he plans for student
participation in the admission department and
in the admissions procedure in order to pro-
duce a more well-rounded student body. It
also indicates his concern for the quality of
student life. These are two issues which now
confront Washington and Lee.

Another factor to be considered is that
of the time element. Mr. Henberg’s opponent
plans to serve as president of his social fra-
ternity and chairman of CONTACT next
year. As Sam Hinkle would doubtlessly
testify, to organize the annual CONTACT
symposium successfully a great amount of
time and effort is required. Coupling this with
the duties of a fraternity president and student
body president put a heavy burden on any-
one—we feel, a too heavy burden. It is only
fair to the students that their president be
able to devote his time solely to their interests
without compromising them with other re-
sponsibilities. Mr. Henberg will be more able
to devote his time fully to his affairs as stu-
dent body president.

We believe it is imperative to emphasize
that we are coming out in favor of a candidate
and not in opposition of a candidate. We have
solely looked at issues in reaching our de-
cision. We also feel that it is an important
duty of this newspaper to face this issue in
its editorial column so that these columns can
fulfill their rightful function, that of assisting
students to form intelligent and objective
opinions.

proposals are a step in the right

Socially, the relaxation of regula

There is more
than one way of
of dealing with
any given __ issue,
and unfortunately
a campaign ranks
among the least effective modes of
operation, Obviously some issues are
raised when persons run for office,
but to my way of thinking, pointing
out a need is too often an end in
itself, an end which supplants the
necessity for hard work.

To illustrate I will use the pro-
posed curriculum reform as an ex-
ample. When the student body voted
on Thursday, these reforms constitut-
ed an “issue.” This is rightly so, but
the fact remains that work on the
curriculum has been in progress for
nearly two years. Obviously, then,
long before this current election the
curriculum was an “issue” to some-
one, specificallly the Curriculum
Committee.

Thus I think to be qualified for
any Executive Committee office, a
candidate should have proven before-
hand his competence in working re-
sponsibly during those long spells both
preceding and folowing the raising
of something as an “issue.” I hope
my work on the Curriculum Com-
mittee for the past two years will
serve to indicate my concern for con-

Larry Honig make my
brief.

In some two dozen editorials this

year, | believe | have made clear
where I stand; opinions intact, let me
tell you what I want to do about
them: realistically, with an eye to
the needs of both the moment and
the future.

First, let me say that the Presi-
dent’s job is a multi-faceted one.
He cannot concern himself with only
one issue to the expense of all others.
Second, let me say that I am familiar
with the rules and procedures by
which the Executive Committee op-
erates, having attended all but two
of its meetings this year.

Now here's my program,

Yes, courses and degrees are im-
portant. We all agree on this, and
we all are looking forward to changes
in this area; but we will know, within
a month, if the faculty will grant
these changes. After that, what? What

structive programs in the Washing-
ton and Lee community.

But for the future, I will first list
those items which I feel need specific
attention in the curriculum:

1. If some sort of short term ar-
rangement passes the faculty, | think
it is clear that enormous revisions
will be made in all course offerings.
It will be a good time for updating,
innovating and expanding. Each de-
partment will probably decide on
certain new requirements and new
courses. To insure that these changes
are not undertaken without student
advice, I propose either modifying the
present Student Curriculum Commit-
tee’s duties to include this advisory
capacity; or, perhaps even better, I
propose urging the departments to
select their own committees of two
or three majors to research student
opinion.

2. The Curriculum Committee this
year suggested to the Political Science
Department a revision of the format
for their introductory course. This
mostly entailed a method of divid-
ing the teaching load so as to limit
emphasis on one specialized branch
of political science. Chances are the
department will test this suggestion
with an experimental section next
year, This format should be looked
into for possible application in other

 

areas.

will be done next year?

I suggest elimination of cut restrict-
ions before and after holidays. This
is but one step but it is a step
forward. As well, we should concern
ourselves with the tangible: washing
machines under the dorm for use by
all students; better parking facilties
using the ungraded, near-campus
areas owned by the University; re-
institution of the second-hand text-
book sales by the Student Library
Committee. These are more steps
forward.

We must concern ourselves with all
people on this campus. Columbia
and Harvard, among a majority of
other law schools, are instituting the
J.D. degree in place of the LL.B.
Why not at Washington and Lee?
This would be another step forward.

We speak of student apathy. I
suggest a self-study by the student
government here of all our student
institutions for the purpose of dis-
covering whether or not these institu-
tions themselves are obsolete. Perhaps
it is the root of student apathy, a
feeling that people who become in-
volved are not effective in their in-
volvement.

3.  Interdepartmental — seminars
should be set up, particularly among
such diverse fields as science, social
science and humanities. It’s time we
stop compartmentalizing knowledge
and recognize that analogous assump-
tions run through all disciplines,

Outside the curriculum [I would
work toward:

1, Setting up an informal program
of student participation in the ad-
missions department. This will in-
clude working for a student on the
admissions committee. My feeling is
that W&L must, under today’s com-
petition, actively sell itself rather
than sit back and wait for reputa-
tion to work wonders. If sufficient ad-
missions staff cannot work full time
to visit all high schools in a large
Southern metropolis such as Atlanta,
then the possibility of student aid
should be considered.

2. Centralizing of such diverse
items as the free forum and poetry
readings in Payne Hall and the new
student center. Along this line, |
would push for a coffee house ar-
rangement (on Sunday perhaps) featur-
ing a variety of entertainment—any-
thing from one man art shows to
folk singing. I would also check
into the possibility of showing weekly
or bi-weekly movies at the student
center,

ll tell you. Through my efforts as
editor of the newspaper, I am re-
sponsible more than any other stu-
dent for the institution of the five-
day week. This year, my edition has
been a constant voice in the move-
ment to place students in positions
on the Board of Trustees an dthe

already taken forward. | am willing
to roll up my sleeves to make sure
this progress continues.

Further, I have the capacity to
serve as your President. Next year,
| shall not be editor. I shall not
be a dormitory counselor again, Jay
Passavant is president of his fra-
ternity, as | am of mine, but that
has not interfered with his administra-
tion. | am chairman of Contact, but
this is a speakers’ program and cer-
tainly not a full-time occupation, And
if it matters, | have been on Dean's
List.

1 will not fabricate an appeal to
you on these bases without intend-
ing to back them up. The Student
Body Presidency is not an office
which exists for the prestige of its
holder but rather for the promotion
of the interests of the students.

I seek to establish a vigorous ad-
ministration. Join me.

portunity to take

the school as a whole. I have been in-
volved in the vital issues which have
confronted this campus during this
time. Now I relish the thought of
being able to use the experience
which | have gained by serving as
your vice-president. I feel that my
experience will be helpful not only
in dealing with student matters, but
more importantly in administering

For Vice President

Our campus is indeed fortunate to
have so many well-respected and
worthwhile traditions. However, we
are now in the crucial process of
questioning the reasoning behind
many traditions, In a sense, ours is
a new age of rationalism. If we are
to remain in contact with modern
society we must be willing to make
changes. However, a change which
requires the destruction of long-held
ideals and promises no replacement
or improvement of the status quo
is meaningless and potentially dang-
erous, In short, | am saying that we
are facing a period of decision-mak-
ing and value judgments which will
have far-reaching effects. The issues
which will be raised will deserve the
attention of every student,

 

There are many issues now pend-

ing and it is not possible to discuss
them all. Several issues seem to have
special importance. Specifically, I feel
that the investigation of the Co-op
should continue with special attention.
Also, | feel that our involvement in
the Virginia Association of Student
Governments (VASG) should be re-
evaluated. Thirdly, it is my opinion
that we should have student repre-
sentatives on all faculty committees
that deal with student affairs. We
should take full advantage of our
representation on the Board of Trus-
tees. These and many other issues
deserve our close attention and as
your vice-president | promise that |
will do my best to see that these
issues are dealt with responsibly and
in the best interest of the university.
I ask your cooperation.

1. Traditionally, Fancy Dress has
been an all-University weekend, Un-

has not been identified with any one
class. With this tradition in mind,

student body through the use of polls
to determine their feelings and prefer-

similar to the Annual Dance Board
Poll, would indicate the students’
preference as to type of music and

“Black Voice” Appeals

For Understanding

By WALT JACKSON

“The Black Voice” spoke to white
Lexington last weekend in a dramatic
appeal for racial understanding. Lex-
ington High School’s Student Organi-
zation for Black Unity (SOBU) pre-
sented the program of Negro culture
at the Troubadour Theatre.

Produced without adult supervision,
the program used music, poetry,
dance, and dramatic readings to ex-
press the frustration of black teen-
agers. In an_ introduction, Joyce
Smothers explained the purpose:

“This is our way of protesting our
lack of participation in the com-
munity, not only in the government,
but also in jobs. We want to be given
a chance to be better. If you do
not want bitter hatred between our
groups, then help us: listen and under-
stand,”

The themes ranged from freedom
songs to scores from the musical
“Hair,” reflecting varying degrees of
alienation. But the prevailing image
was one of dignity coupled with
growing impatience. The message,
though candid, lacked the nihilism of
the urban gheto.

Ihe students read some of their
own poetry, which was intensely per-
sonal and gave an uncommon insight
into the thinking of black people. “A
Boy and His God” by Isca Mack
described the simple faith of a
Negro child and his subsequent dis-
illusionment when he discovers the
reality of “the system.”

Perhaps the most moving perform-
ance was by Charlene Spraggin, who
sang a folk song she had written, It
was a quiet, plaintive prayer for
racial peace, done much in the style
of Joan Baez.

There was no display of anti-white
sentiment, and the one or two al-
tempts at “Burn, baby, burn” rhetoric

le Me Ma Me Me Bn Ma Min tha te te dle ta de se a ta Bee dn lta a ta Ba he Ba lta dia a Bn Ba Ba Ba Ba Bn he

2 dramatic monologues came off
rather inconvincingly. They seemed
factitious and trite, resorting to such
emotional refrains as “My baby was
bitten by a rat.”

Patricia Scott, director of the pro-
gram, explained that it had the dual
function of enhancing the students’
self-confiedence through artistic ex-
pression and making the white com-
munity aware of the talents of blacks.
SOBU, she continued, also has sought
to develop Negro pride by requesting
a black studies course at Lexington
High. The School Board recently
agreed to include it in the curriculum
for next year.

Black students are encouraged to
bring their problems to SOBU, which
then discusses these problems with
the administraion or the teachers in-
volved. According to student Charlene
Scott, quite a number of teachers

have reacted sympathetically and have
shown increased interest in Negro
pupils.

SOBU was founded in February
with help from Liz Cone, a white
VISTA worker, and Randolph Hall,
a militant activist who graduated
from Lexington High and attended
Tuskeegee College. It is now mostly
a student-directed organization of
about 30 Negroes at Lexington High.
The group plans to work in the up-
coming City Council campaign and
hopes to stage a program on the
history of Negro dance from slavery
to the present.

How Students May Aid Poor

Working with the poor has become
a part of the educational experience
of a growing number of Washington
and Lee students. Several programs
in the community offer the chal-
lenge of confronting the problems of
economically disadvantaged people
beyond a perfunctory Christmas bas-
ket for a needy family.

The Young Republicans announc-
ed this week a project to provide
transportation for the federally-fund-
ed Total Action Against Poverty
(TAP) agency. TAP director Harris
Greene explained that in a rural
community it is difficult for the poor
to get to health clincs, government
offices, and community action meet-
ings. Students with cars are asked to
volunteer as drivers.

Sheets will be posted in the book-
store and in fraternity houses which
people can sign indicating the after-
noons on which they might be able
to drive. Volunteering does not obli-
gate one to anything. Mike Alderdice
may be contacted for further details
(463-4579).

History instructor Paul K. Beebee
recently began a tutoring service at
Lylburn Downing Junior High which
has attracted about 30 students. Mr.
Beebee’s wife teaches the sixth grade
at the school, and the program in-
volves some of her pupils, Tutors
from W&L spend one or two after-
noons a week coaching the children
in all subjects. More tutors could be
used in the project.

The Rockbridge Community Chil-
dren’s Center, located in the basement
of R. E. Lee Memorial
Church, provides day care for about
40 children from 3 to 6 years old.
The center is associated with TAP.

Mrs. Scarict Hoffman, director,
especially needs someone to work
with the youngsters in art and music.
Other areas in which college stu-
dents can help are physical educa-
tion, story-telling, and natural science.
The most valuable time is 9:00 to
10:30 a.m., although volunteers can
also be used in the afternoons. The
schedule is flexible and volunteers
may work on different days each

week,

Mrs. Hoffman emphasized that
many of the children are from fami-
lies in which there is no father. Since
the teachers at the Day Care Center
are all women, Washington and Lee
students could provide a male role
for the children to identify with.

W&L has been prominently involv-
ed with the Lexington Boys’ Club.
Coach Verne Canfield serves on the
Board of Directors and law student
Ted Feinour oversees the daily opera-
tion of the club. The University
recently financed the renovation of
the club house (one Rt. 11 near
VM)D), providing new equipment and
donating books for the a library.

About 20 to 25 youngsters, aged
7 to 18, regularly participated in the
club activities. Most are from very
poor families. Recreation activities
include crafts, ping-pong, pool, and
teherball. The boys had a basketball
team in the winter and hope to
field a baseball team.

The club is open from 3:00 to 7:00
p.m. Monday through Friday and
from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. Saturday
and Sunday. Feinour said anyone is
welcome to come by the club house
any afternoon. Students may wish to
set aside one afternoon a week to
help. W&L Young Republicans are
recruting workers to help on a weekly
basis.

No special skills are required for
this type of work, Feinour explaned.
He feels it is helpful just for the
students to talk with the boys and

to play games with them. “Although
the boys may occasionally seem
resentful or indifferent, I think they
basically look up to guys from Wash-
ington and Lee,” he observed.

Feinour belives the main success
of the Boys’ Club has been in giv-
ing the members an opportunity to
develop self-confiedence through par-
ticipation. Although he makes a rather
conservative estimate of the club's
effectivness, he notes that it has been
rewarding to him to see a dropout
return to school and do well after
becoming involved with the club.

Dr. Emory Kimbrough, chairman
of the Sociology Department, states
that he wants to make the resources
of the department available to the
community as much as possible. He
invites studnets interested in com-
munity affairs to contact him about
any project. Dr. Kimbrough says
there is a good chance that within
two or three years Washington and
Lee will have an Upward Bound
program. Under this federal program,
college tutors would attempt to pro-
vide educational and cultural enrich-
ment for disadvantaged high school
and junior high students.

| The Generals showed a clear domi-

| by a sweep of the javelin and several

the shot, respectively, as Williams’
toss of 41° 10” took first in the event.
Mike Neer and John Glace gave W&L
its other one-two finish as Neer leap-

Bill Kahn had another good day,
reaching 21'6'2” to cop the long
jump and taking second in the triple
jump. Robbie Faust also performed
well with a second in the the pole
vault and thirds in the long jump and
triple jump. Deaton and Williams
added to their laurels by finishing
first and third in the discus.

Ihe running events was another
story as the Maroons took every
running event first place and cap-
tured both relays. Harry Zeliff and
Sam Hinkle again took the lead for
the Generals in this part of the meet,
but this time they had to settle for
second place in their events. Zeliff

Golfers Split;
Rain Hurts Play

Last Friday the Washington and
Lee golf team continued its win-
ning ways by downing the Hampden-
Sydney Tigers at the Boonsburg
Country Club in) Lynchburg, Va.
Captain Gary Silverfield said that four
of the six golfers won their matches
to give the Generals the win, 6-3,

In last Tuesday’s match against
Old Dominion and Roanoke, the
rain put a “damper” on things. The
course was very wet and Captain
Gary Silverfield said that the condi-
tions were worse than in any match
he’s ever played here.

As a result of the weather, the
Generals did not do as well as
they had expected. Old Dominion
edged the Generals by a 3%-
2% score, while W&L beat Roa-
noke by a score of 54%4-%. Low score
for the match was 73 by Jim Lee of
Old Dominion. Low for the Generals
was Bob Matthews with a 77.

Other individual performances for

W&L are as follows. Ken Carter
with a 78 beat Roanoke and lost to
Old Dominion. Dick Singletary won
both of his matches. Bill MacCleod
won both his matches with a 79. Gary
Silverfield beat Roanoke and tied!
Old Dominion with a 79, Bob Mat-
thews tied Roanoke and lost to Old
Dominion, and Jim Gordon beat Roa-
noke and lost to Old Dominion. Coach
Twombly said that it was a close
match, but we should have won.

The Generals next match will be
Friday, April 25th at 1:00 p.m, at)
the Lexington Golf Club. Their op- |
ponents will be William and Mary |

 

Stickmen Lose;

B-Sq it
uad Splits

In last Saturday’s action the W&L
lacrosse team was turned back by
a strong North Carolina ten by a
score of 12-6, to suffer its second
loss in South Atalantic Division play.

Despite the score W&L put in a
fine showing. Changes were made in
the offense, the new extra-man offense
proving effective. Fast breaks and un-
settled situations hurt the Generals,
as did their lack of depth, Penalties
also hurt, especially co-captain Char-
lie Stewart who was guarding All-
America attackman Peterson, who
scored four goals and had two assists.

Scorers for W&L were Freshman
Scott Neese who had three goals.
Whitney Morrill had a pair of goals,
with Bart Goodwin rounding out the

scoring. On defense freshman Tom
Smith, from Annapolis, Md. drew
strong praise from Coach Dick
Szlasa.

This weekend the stickmen travel
to Western Maryland College and the
University of Baltimore for a pair of
games, and will return on Sunday.

LACROSSE B-SQUAD

In “B”-squad action last week the
baby Generals beat AMA by a score
of 6-5. Yesterday, however, they took
a beating at the hand of St. Chris-
topher’s, 13-2. St. Cristopher's was
led by high school All-America
Chooch Turner, who had four goals
and four assists. St. Christopher's
jumped out to a 10-0 lead at the
half, with the second half appearing
a closely matched game, as W&L
held them to three goals while scor-
ing two.

Music Groups Seatined

The coming week at Washington
and Lee offers a full agenda for those
interested in music.

The Brass Choir is going to Hollins
to perform and in exchange for
this the Hollins College Music De-
partment is offering a program here.

Bass captures F. D.
with 14-vote margin

Swede Henberg swept the Student
Body Presidency by a landslide, and
Marty Bass emerged as Fancy Dress
President yesterday as the Big-4
elections finally came to a close. A
light turnout and another surprisingly
strong write-in campaign by Bart
Faylor served to confuse matters
enormously and bring about an ex-
tremely close vote on the dance presi-
dency.

Henberg. a PiKA from Laramie,
Wyoming, polled 498 votes, 56% of
the total, in defeating Larry Honig,
a KA from Houston. Honig received
only twenty-two votes more than he
did in the primary in garnering 41%
with 361 votes. Write-ins were few
and scattered in this race as only
Charlie Whipple, a Beta with fifteen,
and Steve Sandler, a ZBT with four,
«captured more than one.
| Ihe election of the Fancy Dress
| President was complicated by the
jentry of Bart Taylor as a write-in
| candidate. Bass, a Sigma Chi from
| Little Rock, and Chris Coursen, a
Washington Phi Psi, battled to a near
standoff with Bass winning by a
fourteen-vote plurality. However,
Bass’ percentage of the vote was only
a mere 37.3% and Cousen’s 35.7%
due to the second successive large
write-in for Taylor, a Phi Kap inter-
mediate law student from Woodland
Hills, Calif. Taylor’s vote amounted
to some 27% of the total, and pre-
vented any candidate from even ap-
proaching a majority. Due to a new
constitutional amendment, Bass has
won the position by virtue of polling
a plurality in the run-off, There were
suprisingly no write-ins other than
those for Taylor.

ing class elections, Petitions for office
will be due at 6:00 p.m. on April
26. They are to be delivered to Jud-
son Simmons at the KA house, and
must consist of fifty different signa-
tures solicited from the class in
which each candidate is running. The
primary election will be held on
Thursday, May 1. For those offices
in which a majority has not been
attained by any candidate a run-off
will be held on Monday, May 5. Run-
off candidates will consist of the top
four primary finishers in EC contests

and the top two finishers for all
class offices.

The Executive Committee is now
also accepting nominations for the

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Jay Passavant: a paragon of leadership

An editor much sager and older than this
one once told us that the editorial columns
of a newspaper existed to commend and
condemn, and that each must be done only
after careful thought and evaluation of facts
and required results. It is with this in mind
that we turn from our usual fare of nitpick-
ing and browbeating to commend a student
who has done as much—if not more—for
the student body of Washington and Lee as
has any student in recent history.

Jay Passavant, Student Body President,
has in his term demonstrated the kind of

 

leadership and _ personal integrity that put

him among a select elite of the finest men
to have held his position (or any other).

Executive Committees have been
laggard in championing any
worthwhile cause, contenting themselves with

Past
notoriously

machinations of business as usual until elec-
tion time. But Jay has, through his sense of
leadership, caused this year’s EC to be able
to credit itself with a myriad of noteworthy
accomplishments. The EC-led High School

“Coeducation” is one of those always-
always words of the genre that can almost
never elicit negative feelings—not quite as
fine a word as “motherhood,” etc., but almost.
The word’s use in recent weeks has brought
upon this quiet campus some lively dialogue,
encouraging editorials, and probably a bit of
wishful thinking. We, too, like to muse about
how it might have been had there been girls
here, available and everything!, our freshman
year. Save on gas, save on unfortunate blind
dates, save wear and tear on ourselves.

And savings is one of the prime reasons
that coeducation is being considered by those
who consider such matters at W&L. Not that
it would save money in the short run to have
girls in attendance——new facilities, or at least
renovations of the present ones, would be
in order, as would time- and fund-consuming
attention to smaller details, such as degree
requirements, the application of rules (all
sorts), and the role of fraternities and, most
likely, sororities,

No, the question of savings arises from a
broader overview which begins with the un-
that within the next
dec ade or two, private institutions especially

small ones—are going to face monumental
(often devastating ) deficits of funds. To make
simple a complicated explanation, operating
costs per student at private colleges are fis-

rising, and, as a result, 2) faster than tuitions

tion of Student Governments brought young
students from Lexington to a film presenta-
tion and question-and-answer session at W&L.
Jay sponsored the Executive Committee’s first
real student-body blitz session in the “Bitch-
in,” where EC members answered questions
from and heard suggestions made by students.
And though attendance at the first of these
was hardly encouraging, another recently took
place to discuss the Honor System.

This year Jay has led the EC into a review
of Dance Board and Co-op policies with an
eye toward bettering the students’ return on
whatever investments they make. The Student
Civil Liberties Committee, a novelty for W&L,
received the endorsement and assistance of
the president, which is just an indication of
his attention to the desires of all the students,
not just a select group.

Jay has led the EC in establishing a more
viable and logical set of guidelines concern-
ing the Honor System. In the face of attack
or apathy or both, he has capably and ad-
mirably maintained his aplomb and _perspec-
tive temperance to mold harmony on this emo-
tional issue, combining his respected leader-
ship on the EC with the foresight to use
distinguished advisors within the University.

For the first time, the Executive Commit-
tee of the student body has been granted a
non-voting representative to the Board of
Trustees (the Student Body President) and
to the faculty EC (chosen by the president
of the student body). It would not be correct
to ascribe these developments to Jay, but
it would be fair to say that had the EC’s
president been a man of less calibre the
decisions may not have been made this year.

In spite of this impeccable record com-
piled by Jay for himself and for the EC,
no useless idealism has been displayed. Jay
has viewed his role in pragmatic terms, pre-
ferring candor and genuineness to the easy
trap of political drone.

We extend to Jay our sincere congratula-
tions and warmest thanks as members of the
student body for a term well spent, for
leadership superbly demonstrated, and for ac-
complishments impressively tallied.

(and, presumably, greater prestige) to the
school. Something like that.

Whether this is true or not remains at
present an undecided issue. That Yale, Har-
vard, and Princeton have made the decision
to “go co-ed’’(in presidential parlance) is
neither an indication that such action will
produce greater revenues nor an assurance of
its advisability. These schools, to begin with,
will very likely not face a dollar-dilemma as
frustrating as will Washington and Lee.

Certainly there are innumerable advant-
ages, or at least good points, which speak
well for coeducation here. But perhaps the
one that emerges from the ballyhoo most
lauded is All-those-pretty-girls-and-right-here-
too, Not too bad an argument! The rest,
though, are subject to more scrutiny. Whether
or not competition in the classroom will be
increased cannot be decided by argumenta-
tion — if it can be decided at all; should
grades suddenly rise, would this be the result
of heightened competition or increased ad-
mission standards?

Another argument frequently raised in
support of coeducation is that it would create
a more natural atmosphere on campus and
make us as students actually be gentlemen.
Both facets have merit. But just as meritorious
are the counterpoints that education at W&L
is training us to lead lives in a political society,
political in whatever endeavor—business and
industry, education, government, journalism,
science, law. And these fields are, at their
top levels, almost devoid of women. Men
vs. men. And for the “gentlemen’’ part, the
Washington and Lee campus has been, is
now, and will probably continue to be one
of the best-behaved, most gentlemanly camp-
uses in the nation,

All this is Not to say we are opposed to
coeducation at W&L. We prefer to think

ON LONG ISLAND, where I live, |
there are windmills. Perhaps you've
seen them where you live too, They're |
a marvelous creation, turning the air |
into power effortlessly, and without |
thought for good or bad, Power to |
create, power to destroy: the wind- |
mill knows and cares not; an amoral |
machine, but it does its job,

We walk this valley for so few |
days. Awesome creatures we are, you
and I. At night even in the darkest
torments of hallucination, rest as-
sured, rest knowing that Man alone
of all God's children can build a
Tower of Babel. Rest knowing what
man alone can tear assunder utterly
all that He hath wrought.

I know a man slightly. His name
is Jamil Baroody and he is an Arab,
He once said to me, “Come let us
reason together.” He quoted to me
thusly my prophet who is his prophet
who is all our prophet. Here lies the
pivot point.

Isaiah, dead two millenia, Quote
me a prophet of today, if you will.
You can't, I can’t. Reb Hillel, an
aged ancient man was told by a
Roman general with sword drawn to

one-legged and said, “Love thy neigh-
bors as thyself.” All the rest is com-

“Good walls (and ABM’s) make good
neighbors,”

Our minds are occupied with sur-
vival. As Nobel Laureate George

| Wald of Harvard recently noted, “I

think what we (adults) are up against
is a generation that is by no means
sure that it has a future.”

The world today, this campus to-
day, is too wrapped up with medium
to spread message. Without cause,
without objective intangiable, we come
like Bierce’s zealots, who, having lost
sight of their goals, redouble their
efforts,

We react in violent anguish to this
experience of treadmill movements:
the S.D.S. siezes buildings and deans,
the blackest black militants would
enclose themselves in cocoons that
even the late, lamented Leander Perez
would never have dreamed of creat-
ing. Denied surety of a future, we
destroy the security of the past. Don't
trust anyone,

We sieze the day. To fill a belly
in justice. Every man’s death—no
matter his belief —diminishes us.
quote (out of context?) Sir Herbert
Lawrence: “The sanctity of human
existence is today too often exaggerat-
ed.” Concern is not with mankind
raised to some higher plateu but with
the good life enjoyed by all men in

Governor Mills E. Godwin said
on Friday that the Virginia Gen-

for its “cautious, but prudent” work
in revising the Virginia Constitu-
tion.

action in the state (the Richmond |
newspapers, the Virginia Conserva-|
tive Party, T. Coleman Andrews, Lt.
Gov. Fred Pollard) need not worry,
Politically, Virginia is still in the
Middle Ages.

By a vote of 20-19, the Virginia
Senate rejected a proposed constitu-
tional amendment that would have
expanded the franchise to include 18-
year olds. These 20 staunch defend-
ers of democracy have denied 300,-

To the Editor

Hear the student voice

An Open Letter to the Faculty:
While the merits of the curriculum
revision have been fully discussed,
there seems to be one aspect of this
change which has not been mention-

ed. It seems significant that at a
lime when campus revolution and
students force their demands with

violence, change at Washington and
Lee has been marked by responsible
student action and by cooperation
with the faculty.

Che proposed curriculum revisions
were initiated after careful study by
the Faculty and Student Curriculum
Committee. The Student Executive
Committee then examined these pro-
posals, endorsed them, and informed
the student body as to what these
changes would mean. Finally, in a
record turnout, eighty percent of
the student body voted with the re-

sults being an overwhelming en-
dorsement of the recommended re-
vision, Such responsible action in-

volving the vast majority of the stu-
dent body presents a striking contrast
to such events as last weekend's armed

 

progressive for them. Why 18-year} take-over of an administration build-

olds might even commit the high, mg at Cornell by a minority of

The Richmond
praised the wisdom of the Virginia

Senate in turning down the vote for |

18-year olds, and said that if the
voters of the state really want to
express a preference for broadening
the franchise, they could do so by
electing candidates who favor such a
move. In other words, don't give the
voters a chance to express them-
selves on the issue directly, but throw
im several other issues and make the
results truly inconclusive

| for one plan to vote for every
candidate from Linwood Holton on
down who publicly endorsed the vote
for 18-year-olds, no matter what they
say about the other issues. As Dr
Colvin would say, “Throw _ the

Stickmen beat Maryland;
setback in second match

Over Springs Weekend the varsity
lacrosse squad was visiting two schools
in Maryland. In the first stay, how-
ever, our team wasn’t too nice to its
host as it handed Western Maryland
a 15-1 defeat. The tells the
tale as the Generals almost shut
out the home team.

All the starting attackers broke into
the scoring column. Even most of
the “B” squad members who came
in on. offense talleyed. The wet
weather only contributed to Western
Maryland’s problems,

Only one thing blemished the big
victory for Washington and Lee. De-
fensive stalwart and co-captain Char-
lie Stewart sustained an injury, which

score

may keep him out of action for at
least a week.
After a late afternoon game, Satur-

day morning brought on powerhouse

 

lacrosse

Baltimore. Baltimore faces

 

 

foes such as Maryland and Navy,
two of the finest teams in the nation.

All these factors added up to a 10-3

loss for Washington and Lee Uni-
versity.

Bill Brumback stepped in for in-
jured Stewart and did an excellent

job as Big Blue led 2-0 after the first

quarter, But a defensive lapse in
the second period hurt W&L as the
score stood 6-2 at the whistle. The

final score stood at 10-3 with Balti-
more on top,

Despite plenty of depth, the major
problem remains to be inexperience.
Coach Szlasa could give out nothing
but praise, however, for all of his
team’s play to date.

Goshen Classic set for Saturday
with several categories and prizes

Thanks to a week of heavy rains, ;
the water rushing through Gosher
Pass is high and fast, a situation that
is causing tubing afficiados to awail
excitedly this Saturday's running of
the Goshen Classic.

“This is the best I've seen the rivet
in the past three seasons at this time
in April,” remarked Classic director |
Jerry Perlman, “and | would not be
surprised to see records fall in all
three events. The Downriver Grand
Slalom record set last year of 32
minutes flat should be in special
jeopardy.”

Although entries have only begun |
to trickle into Classic headquarters, |
Perlman is confident of a large field, |
and stated that among early contest: |

Baseball squad
loses on road trip

to H-S tigers 5-1

Washington and Lee’s _ baseball
team simply couldn’t put things to-
gether as it lost Monday 5-1 against
Hampden-Sydney. The Generals were
hitting the ball well but the horse-
hide never dropped in.

Hampden-Sydney started the scor-
ing in the third inning with a stolen
base, a blown run-down, and single.
In the next inning an error with
bases loaded boosted the Hampden-
Sydney total to four runs. A double
followed by a single was the last
scoring that the opponents made in
the fifth inning. Washington and Lee’s
sole run came when co-captain Jim
Wilson singled in a runner.

Jim Wilson did an overall excel-
lent job against Hampden-Sydney. He
got two hits and performed admir-
ably as the the team’s leader, Bob
La Rue turned out a clutch double
while pinch hitting. The pitcher, Gil
Fitzhugh, who went the distance for
W&L also got two hits.

This Saturday Washington and Lee
faces O.D.C. in a double header.

Tennis

The varsity tennis team lost to
the same opponent twice this week—
the rain. Friday's match scheduled
with Randolph-Macon and Wednes-
day’s match against V.C.U. were each
washed out. These matches will prob-
ably be re-scheduled but meanwhile
hopes are high that rain won't stop
the meeting between W&L and Madi-
son this afternoon,

‘The way

I see it’

(Editor’s note: “The way I see it”
is a column of general editorial
comment for which contributions
are solicited from students and
faculty concerning any topic.)

By BRUCE DOWNING

During this, the last semester of
my college career, | have often been
struck by the discrepancy in treat-
ment of the seniors and freshmen on
this campus. The freshmen are given
special treatment, “assimilated” into
college by the experience/ordeal of
Freshman Camp, a recpetion on the
lawn, and a series of thoughtful, en-
lightening talks by prominent mem-
bers of the faculty.

My favorite among these gems was
that on “The Next Four Years,” a
description of what our college life
would be like. If the freshmen get
all this attention, why isn’t there a
similar lecture for the seniors on
“The Last Four Years” which would
sum up our useful and happy years
at W&L. It would serve as a proper
sequel to the original. And so many
changes have occurred on this campus
during the last four years that some
comment would seem appropriate.

But, of course, for the class of °69,
no such summation is necessary. That
lecture during our freshman year was
so complete and so accurate that
another one would be mere repitition.
Why, I can still hear the words of
the great Dean now...

“First, gentlemen (and you are
gentlemen), I would like to give you
some advice. Don't worry about all
this talk and bother about the speak-
ing tradition and the dress tradition.
During your four years, both of
these will be done away with as
obsolete replicas of the past. I just
hope that you all didn’t believe that
propaganda we or the College Townie
Shop sent you during the summer.
As for the speaking tradition, the less
said, the better.

“And | want to apologize for the
rough academic schedule that you
will go through this year. But don't
worry, very soon the POF System
(Pass or Fail) will be in effect. Start-
ing in your junior year, the progres-
sive faculty plan to eliminate all
grades, a la The Hopkins.* And by
that year you should be free to go
down to the Briah on Friday night,
when our progressive faculty abolishes
those nasty reminders or our glori-
ous past: Saturday classes.

*That should be lot of POF's (you
may laugh, gentlemen).

“| must apologize again to those
of you who have affiliated with a
fraternity, You will be threatened
periodically with the spectre of de-
ferred rush because you will be,
naturally, negative influences on this
campus (at this point cheers from
the Beta section). But don't worry,
no matter how bad it looks, the
faculty is only trying to scare you.
To be truthful, we wouldn't know
what to do with the freshmen any-
way, even if we got them...

“Yes and there will be lots more
changes during “The Next Four
Years.” We will get two new student
unions—yes, I said two, count ‘em,
two: the second and best will be
open in 1967, of is it 1968 oF 1969,
Well. at least you will see it as
alumni. And will have curriculum
revision and the short semester, again
due to our progressive faculty, in
1968 of is it 1969. And we will have
a new gym by 1969 too (or is it...)
And the school will be a national
leader in adopting coeducation (as in
girls) in time for your senior year,
vou lucky devils. Of course some of
these progressive reforms may be de
layed, but all will be ready in time
for your graduation

“Yet don't despair.—everything will
not change during the “Next Four
Years.” | am sure, with your active
support, continuity and tradition will
reign supreme. Why even now, as
I stand here, one of the outstanding
members of your class, Gross John
son, is sharing himself with others
(and vice versa) in the distinguished
tradition of that great alumnus,
Arthur Huntley Reid.”

Economic restraint urged

by ex-Secretary H.

In Lee Chapel last night Henry
H. Fowler, former Secretary of the
Treasury, gave his first formal ad-
dress since leaving the cabinet in
December. Fowler’s talk was an
evaluation of the apparent trends of
the Nixon administration in the areas
of monetary policy, tax reform, and
international finance.

He cited five areas in which the
Nixon Administration had continued
the basic policies of the Johnson era.
They include Nixon’s desire to slow

successful fiscal policy tool, and to
discard it now would be harmful to
the economy. Fowler was also oppos-
ed to the advocated reduction in the
surtax from 10 per-cent to 5 per-cent.

In closing his talk, the former
Treasury Secretary had two proposals.
First, he urged a “strong ‘hold-the-
line’ position on existing policies of
fiscal and monetary restraint to mini-
mize the risk of any return to a
situation of an excess of demand con-
tributing to inflation.” Second, he

Fowler

urged the use of voluntary restraint
on the part of business and labor to
absorb the cost increases that are
fueling the cost-push inflation, which
| in his opinion is at the heart of the
| U.S.’s present inflationary problems.

Fowler's talk was the second an-
nual Lecture on Public Affairs spon-
sored by the School of Commerce
| and financed by alumni contributions
| to that school. Last year’s speaker was

| economic advisor.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Aconversation with the President

(Below is an interview with President Robert E. R. Huntley,
obtained for The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi by Assisant Edi-
torial-Page Editor Glenn Azuma, a freshman from New
Milford, N. J. This edition expresses to President Huntley
sincere thanks for his time and patience in granting the
interview.—Ed. )

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi: In the past several months cer-
tain developments in the University, such as the proposed
curriculum changes and association with Hollins, Randolph-
Macon, Hampden-Sydney, Sweet Briar College, and Davidson,
have been discussed. In light of these developments we would
like to know what you feel are the immediate and long range
outlooks for Washington and Lee.
President Huntley: That’s a broad question.

Do you mean specifically in regard to curriculum and co-
education?
R-t Phi: Yes. I think coupled with this question might be that
of the future of the small independent college in America.
Since it seems that the fate of the small institution in the United

States is that of our school.

Pres. Huntley: There are a great many people who have
pointed out that small institutions like Washington and Lee
are going to have increasing difficulty, principally financially
in the years ahead. I don’t think anyone knows the exact
extent to which that is true. I obviously don’t anticipate that
Washington and Lee’s financial troubles are going to put it

out of business.

I do feel very strongly (and I think that my feeling is
shared by all others on the faculty here) that the role of an
institution like Washington and Lee is that of a predominantly

teaching institution with a relatively low enrollment and a
relatively high teacher-student ratio. The emphasis as I have
said is principally on teaching as distinguished from research,
contract research and so forth. The role of this institution is
going to be more important than it has been in the past be-
cause it is going to be rarer in the future than in the past.

The pressures certainly have been(over the past decade
and probably will be over the next decade or more) to abandon
this objective. These pressures are from many sources. Pres-
sure from circumstances is going to be in the direction of
much enlarged enrollments, large graduate affiliations, signi-
ficant contract research and other kinds of research affiliated
with the graduate institution.

Those have been the pressures since World War II and
I see no reason to believe that they will let up in the years
ahead. This leads me to conclude that the role Washington
and Lee can fulfill will be more important rather than less
important in the years ahead.

I do not think there is no place for the large, principally
graduate-oriented university. There obviously is; in fact it is
clear that quantitatively and in some areas qualitatively such

institutions will play the major role in the future.

However, it seems to me equally clear that American
higher education will have lost, and lost irreplaceably, a great
deal if the institutions of this size and our goals are squeezed
out. We should be able to offer some distinctive educational
advantages, different from the kind which can be achieved
at a large university. The principal emphasis is that there are
going to be different opportunities offered in a school like
this and in my view they will be better in many cases.

It seems to me desirable that there be an element of di-
versity in our higher education. I would hate to see a single
pattern emerge in American higher education ten years from
now. I believe that has been the direction of things for the
last twenty years and so I see it as more important than ever
that a school like Washington and Lee work hard at achieving
the ideas of a cohesive student-faculty situation.

We feel the need for, as is expressed in the Curriculum
Committee report, a revised schedule for distribution require-
ments and major requirements in some cases. Our objective
is to allow the individual student a wider measure of choice.
In some respects the issues of co-education, a diverse cur-
riculum, small size and less stringent course requirements tug
againt each other.

It is difficult to retain a large, diverse curriculum and
faculty with a small student body, economically as well as
sometimes pedagogically.

R-t Phi: Wouldn't you say one of the main problems is of a
financial nature?

Pres. Huntley: I’d say that it is an economic problem in the
broadest sense of that term. Financial being one aspect of
“economic” as I am using the term. Even if one had no real
problem of sources of dollars—and that will never be the
case—but if one did there would still be a felt need to be
able to justify to one’s self, as well to other sources of dollars,
that you are spending these funds in a reasonably efficient man-
ner. I suggest that such a need will be felt by anyone who
administers any institution.

It is obviously economically more difficult for an institution
of 1,400 to 1,500 to maintain a curriculum with a large num-
ber of courses than it is for an institution of 15,000.

The desire to broaden the curriculum does at some point
run counter to the desire to remain small. Thus I think we
have been able to manage a fairly good compromise between
these two opposite forces. I assume we can continue to do that,
yet we have got to be continuously aware of the problem.

The desire to afford the student a wider measure of choice
could result in a concentration of students in a fairly narrow
area of the curriculum, One of the purposes of required courses
is to guarantee a certain spread of the student body through
the curriculum by requiring certain subjects. This in turn
affords at least a minimum guarantee of your ability to offer
a large curriculum.

 

So if you afford, as we want to do, a larger measure of |
choice to the students, you at the same time run the risk of |
the students in a given year or four-year period making choices |

by themselves which tend to concentrate in a narrower area

lot the curriculum and in a sense leave the other parts of the

Curriculum changes found
needed for W&L’s growth

By BOB ENTZMINGER
News Editor, Friday edition

The Faculty Curriculum Committee
recently released a report which sug-
gests three basic changes in our cur-
riculum. Although I wish to concern
myself here primarily with the pro-
posals for reducing distribution re-
quirements, | want first to say that
I feel each of the recommendations
will help alleviate the rigidity pres-
ently imposed by the curriculum and
Il urge their adoption, whatever the
form, on Thursday,

Perhaps to some people the practi-
cal need for a less restrictive cur-
riculum has not been demonstrated.
However, it is clear that W&L has
in recent years suffered a substantial
decline in the number of applica-
tions it receives per year (1599 in
1965 to 1153 in 1968). For the first
time, private institutions are seriously
competing with large state universities
for top students. While it may be
true that curriculum is not a signifi-
cant factor in choosing a college for
the average high school student, it
does appear to be a decisive element
for those top students which W&L
most wants to attract. Clearly large
universities offer many advantages
private institutions cannot afford. The
competitive position of schools like
WAL lies in their ability to provide
flexible curricula and an_ individual
approach to education. The present
set-up at W&L allows for neither.

Included in the committee's report
is a study of the distribution require-
ments of schools comparable to and
competitive with W&L. Almost all
had distribution requirements signific-
antly less than ours, thus offering
the alternative of flexibility to state
schools and thereby increasing their
competitive advantage over WA&L.
Our distribution requirements pres-
ently account for about 55 percent of
the total credits needed for gradua-
tion (assuming no advanced place-
ment), while only U. Va. and Swarth-
more of the schools studied (both
with about 40 percent) approached
this figure, Wesleyan and Swarthmore
have no distribution requirments at
all, and Duke and Davidson waive
them for some students.

Until W&L’s curriculum is made
more competitive with the schools
mentioned and offers a real alterna-
tive to large state universities, it is
likely that applications will decline
not only in number but in percent-
age of top students, Of course, the
solution advocated by the committee
is NO panacea, but it will help signific-
antly.

By reducing the ratio of distribu-
tion requirements to total number of
hours needed for graduation, a stu-
dent may move into his major more
quickly and with more depth, a basic
concern for many high school students
according to Dean Farrar, and for
the sake of a broad education he may
choose electives which really interest
him.

Practical arguments opposing any
changes in distributive requirements
tend to ignore the changing demands
of students, Instead, they focus on
the possible detrimental effects of
making the curriculum less restrictive.
Many fear that some departments,
the maintenance of which we all
agree are necessary, would suffer
great losses of students as a result.
Evidence seems to point to the con-
trary. The School of Journalism has
survived, though its courses meet no
distribution requirement. But even if
some departments suffer temporary
decreases in enrollment, | think it is
erroneous to believe all professors
must teach a full course load to
full classes cach semester. Resources

could be rechanneled into research, |

writing, and more _ individualistic
teaching approaches, endeavors which
would in turn strengthen the depart-
ment and make it more attractive
to successive generations of students.

The philosophical objections raised
to reducing restrictions are that a
broad range of courses, including cer-
tain ones deemed basic by tradition,
are indigenous to a liberal education.
In the first place, the proposed
changes still require a broad range
of course offerings; the number need-
ed is simply reduced. Secondly, the
incorporation of basic courses into
curricula stems from a time when
very few courses of competing vaidity
were available. That is not now the
case. Thirdly as I have previously
stated, secondary schools are now
providing experience in the different
types of learning which these basic
courses were designed to offer.
Finally, it seems to me that W&L
can justify its existence only if it
offers an alternative to the cheaper
multiversity approach to education.
Such an alternative lies only in
W&L’s potential flexibility (unrealized
up to now) and its claim of an indi-
vidualistic approach. Yet the assump-
tion that everyone needs the same
background of courses in essentially
collective, imposing a rigidity which
belies that claim.

There is a problem with defining
the term “liberal education.” If one
takes it to mean that there are certain
things one ought to be acquainted
with (a claim against qualified
validity) the argument for teaching
basic courses holds up, though the
necessity for requiring them on the
college level remains in question. If,
however, you feel, as I do, that the
real goal of a liberal education is
to stimulate curiosity and promote
inquiry into a diverse range of sub-
jects, then requiring courses in which
the student is not interested in funda-
mentally illiberal as it is approached
here, because that requirement tends
to foster a passive approach to the
educational exeperience. This pas-
sivity has long been an issue at W&L,
and I think it is due in large measure
to the stifling effects freshman and
sophomore courses have, not because
they are dull courses in themselves,
but because they are peopled by stu-
dents whose interests lie elsewhere.

A related argument is the one
which Mr. Honig presented in the
Feb. 25 issue of the Ring-tum Phi,
The Tuesday editor fears that allow-
ing students an earlier concentration
in a major would turn W&L into
a “trade school.” Of course, insofar
as it is predominantly engaged in
preparing men for the professions, it
is that already, and I don't believe
Mr. Honig to be against increasing
the professional competence of our
graduates. The basis for his argument
is that one will be incomplete with-
out taking certain courses, a stance
given long-standing validity at W&L.
I feel, on the other hand, that the
graduate is incomplete if he has not
been actively engaged in his own
education, and it is here that I find
WAL deficient. Basic freshman cours-
es no longer inculcate the virtues of
intellectual curiosity, and the passive
approach they do engender is car-
ried into upper level courses.

Clearly, either the minority or
the majority report would help allevi-
ate the problems | described by pro-
viding greater flexibility in the cur-
riculum. | favor the adoption of the
majority report for several reasons.
In the first place, about 70 percent
of the students voting in the refer-
endum last week chose it. Secondly,

No health exams?

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:
On Tuesday, April 15, | presented
myself at the WAL Infirmary to have
a simple physical examination done
to present to a graduate school, a
prerequisite to attendance at that
institution, as it is at WAL, The exam
appears simple, to the layman at
least, requiring the measurement of
height, weight, temperature, pulse,
blood pressure, urine, and vision, fol-
lowed by a list of eighteen conditions
which are to be checked normal of
abnormal (such as teeth and head).
I was told by the nurse at the
desk and by Dr. Brush, who was
silting smoking his pipe in the wait-
ing room, that our infirmary no longer
gives these physical examinations, |
think this policy should be challeng-
ed. What is the function of the
infirmary if not to care for the health
needs of students? Ascertaining sick-
ness is surely included in this: a
student should have the same right

Our hope is that the student body will be sufficiently di-

On co-education there are many advantages which may
be pointed to; however, you'll find some argument about
them in almost any group of half a dozen people. Certainly,
advantages do exist. It is to be noted however, that a decision

to become co-ed is related to decisions concerning size of the
institution and is related less directly to curriculum. The ques-
tions cannot be divorced from each other.

For example if Washington and Lee were to decide to
become co-ed, as might well indeed occur, a decision would
obviously have to be made to what extent to become co-ed,

sion would also have to be made whether that fraction should
be in lieu of a similar number of male students or in addition
to the existing student body.

there was a declining number of students making applications
to Washington and Lee and with this there was seemingly a
lowered entrance standard. What is being done to rectify this
situation?

Pres. Huntley: As Dean Farrar I’m sure pointed out there has
been since about 1965 a decline in the total number of applica-
tions to Washington and Lee at a rate of about 4 to 5 per cent

On such a graph from 1965 to the present you would find

point. The percentage of students enrolled here who were
in the top percentile of their graduating class is virtually
identical to that of 1965.

Part of the decline may be attributable to a declining use
of multiple applications, a result of better guidance counseling.
A part of the reason clearly is the increased percentage of
students in the nation who are attending public institutions
as opposed to private in the past 3-4 years. The causes for
this trend are manifeld, one of them may be tuition differences
and costs.

The extent to which coeducation affects the picture at the
moment is unclear. It is the view of a good many people that
in the past two to three years coeducation or its absence affects
the decisions of more students than it used to. I do not think
there is anything in the figures that you have alluded to which
is significant enough for a cause to panic.

It was not to be expected that the steep incline that
existed from 1950-1965 would continue. We are making more
vigorous recuiting efforts than we have in the past. This is

1965. It is a recognition that as other schools become increas-
ingly active in recruiting efforts it would be very shortsighted
for us not to do the same.

We intend to bring Washington and Lee to the attention
of as many people in as many sections of the country as
possible. The reason for making serious efforts to bring Wash-
ington and Lee to the attention of students is in part to prevent

a part of the student’s health,

The argument I received in the in-
firmary was that there was not enough
time to examine all those who wish
to be examined, yet there has been
an increase in infirmary hours and
a doctor added to the staff, without
a significant increase in number of
students in the last couple of years.
I think it only just that if the per-
sonnel in the infirmary wish to lighten
their work load, then their pay should
be proportionately decreased. The
students have been paying for this
service and I am sure that next semest-
er’s students will gladly deduct any
amount from their tuition,

quite clear: we will need to be able to count on intelligent |

a large part, by formal and informal means and a great goal |
is to encourage a spirit of co-operation and responsibility by all |
segments without developing an adversary attitude between
different groups.

Faculty Approves Majority Pro

 

Atwood To Replace
Retiring Dean Adams

Dr. Lewis W. Adams will retire
July 1 as Dean of Washington and
Lee University’s School of Commerce
and Administration and he will be
succeeded in that position by Dr.
Edward C. Atwood Jr., the Uni-
versitys Dean of Students.

Both changes were announced
Thursday by Robert E. R. Huntley,
University president.

Dr. Adams, 65, is only the fourth
dean in the School of Commerce

and Administration’s 64-year history.
He has served as dean for 20 years.

 

Dean Adams

Although stepping down as dean, he
will continue to teach in the School.

Dr. Atwood, 46, has been the Uni-
versity’s Dean of Students since 1962.
He also will continue to be a pro-
fessor of economics after assuming
his new post.

“A few words cannot even suggest
the magnitude of Dean Adams’ ac-
complishment for Washington and
Lee during his years here,” President

i.

 

Dean Atwood

Huntley said. “The School of Com-
merce and Administration, as the
result of his wise guidance, has de-
served and achieved national recogni-
tion for its strong faculty, high
standards and balanced curriculum.

“That a man of Dean Adams’ tare
ability should have brought to this
school his professional career and
his personal devotion is indeed a
major tribute to Washington and
Lee. lt is gratifying to know that he
will continue as an active member
of the faculty in the years ahead.”

A native of Andrews, N.C., Dean
Adams initially joined the Washing-
ton and Lee faculty in 1926 as an
instructor if economics, a posilion

The School of Commerce and Ad-

schools in the nation to earn national
accreditation from the American As-
sociation of Collegiate Schools of
Business. Only about 130 out of 600
schools in the nation have member-
ship in the association.

Dean Adams earned his bachelor
of science degree at the University of
North Carolina in 1925, and his
doctorate at Cornell University in
1949. He was an instructor at Cornell
in the 1925-26 and 1930-31 academic
sessions, |

He joined the New York firm of
Holsapple & Co. as a security analyst |
in 1933 and was appointed manager |
of the company’s statistical depart-
ment in 1937.

During World War Il, Dean Adams
served as administrative officer for

of the Field Administration Division
of the Bureau of Naval Personnel in
Washington, D.C. He received com-
mendations from President Truman

(12-12-6 Plan
Also Ratified

In a two-and-a-half hour special
meeting yesterday, the faculty voted
to accept the majority method of
reducing distribution requirements
and a calendar change incorporating
a short term at the end of the school
year, Both programs are due for
implementation by the fall of 1970,

Both the Majority and Minority
plans, as well as proposed calendar
changes and other proposals yet to
be voted upon, were presented to the
faculty some time ago by the Faculty
Curriculum Committee and were
aired by the Faculty Discussion Club
prior to the vote yesterday afternoon,

The committee, chaired by Dr.
Henry S. Roberts, supported the need
for a more flexible curriculum largely
on the basis of the need to attract
good students on a continuing basis.
A majority of the committee, as well
as of the students voting in a recent
referendum, supported the plan which
would most liberalize distribution re-
quirements. The students also sup-
ported changing the calendar to two
12 week terms with one 6 week
term in the spring, though by a
slimmer margin.

The Majority Plan

The plan finally adopted was the
one accepted by a majority of the
members of the committee, except
that journalism courses were deleted
from the list of social science require-
ments. Under this plan, the student
will have to fulfill 36 hours of dis-
tribution requirements, six from each
of four divisions and 12 at large,
in order to graduate.

Those divisions include
Division I—English, French, Ger-

man, Greek, Latin, Russian, and
Spanish:
Division H—Fine Arts, History,

Philosophy, and Religion;

Division Hl—Biology, Chemistry,
Geology, Mathematics, and Physics:

Division IV—Economics, Political
Science, Psychology, and Sociology-
Anthropology.

A maximum of 12 hours from each
division may be counted toward dis-
tribution requirements.

Minority Plan Less Flexible
The rejected Minority Plan te-
quired the student to take a mini-
mum of 46 hours, distributed in the
following manner:
18 hours in Division I, includ-
six in English and completion of

a.
ing

the second year of any other langu-
age;
b. 12 hours in Division Il, with

courses taken in at least two of the
departments listed;
c. 10 hours in Division Il,

A New Image for WEL

The faculty’s decisions to revise the academic calendar
and to modify the distribution requirements must be consid-
ered the most revolutionary changes Washington and Lee
University has made in many years. Undoubtedly, these re-
visions will cause prospective and current students alike to look
at W&L as a dynamic, innovative university rather than as
a sleepy, unimaginative bastion of higher learning not unlike
high school.

The benefits which will be derived from these new proposals
have been stated many times before and do not bear repeat-
ing. However, it must be noted that these innovations will
give more responsibilities to both the students and the faculty.
Students will have to work harder because the course loads
will be condensed (each course will be taught in 12 weeks
rather than 15 weeks). At the same time, all departments will
have to reevaluate their courses and teaching methods con-
tinually in order to attract more students.

With students working harder at courses and independent
projects they have chosen for themselves (and not been
forced to take) and with each department striving to offer more
relevant and updated subjects, Washington and Lee will come
closer to fulfilling the true objective of any college, i.e., inspir-
ing students to learn for the sake of learning rather than to
learn for the sake of grades.

All we can do is thank the faculty for bringing Washing-
ton and Lee back into touch with modern educational stand-
ards. The only thing we regret is that we will not be here to
reap the benefits.

Our April 25th Silence

Throughout this year this edition of the Ring-tum Phi has
been interested in the problems of the city of Lexington. We
have done this because we feel that, as W&L students, we have
a moral and social responsibility to help those who are less
fortunate. We feel that students should be made aware of these
local conditions and correct them whenever injustices are
detected.

Last week the Ring-tum Phi learned about a case of alleged
racial discrimination concerning a W&L student and his date
in a local establishment. We were about to expose this incident
in the April 25 issue when we discovered some of the facts
were contradictory. Since we did not want to risk injuring
the integrity of either party and because it was too late to
omit the story, we suspended publication. This act was decided
upon solely by the editorial staff without outside pressure of
any kind. Since last Friday, the true facts have been de-
termined and the parties involved have reached an under-
standing.

Even though we did not publish the story, our intent to
print it has brought the desired results. We have received a
guarantee from the owner of the establishment in question
that it will no longer follow selective discriminatory practices
and will serve anyone at any time regardless of his race, creed
or color. In addition, we were guaranteed that actions of
employees concerning this problem will also be watched closely.

We sincerely regret any inconveniences we may have caused
by not publishing last week. However, we made what we
considered to be the best decision for everyone involved, and
we would do it again under similar circumstances.

Dance Plans--R.LP.

“Dance Plans, Rest in Peace! Because if nothing is done
to make you more attractive to students, you will die a fast
death.”

Allow us to explain why this is the case. It is actually just
a simple math problem. We currently pay $40 for a Dance
Plan, which entitles us to attend the concerts of four party
weekends. This means that we pay $10 for entertainment
for each of the weekends (or $9 apiece if we “take advantage”
of the special price of $36 offered during the summer). If a
Dance Plan holder decides not to remain on campus for one
of the weekends, he pays the equivalent of over $13 for each
weekend's entertainment.

The above prices also include admission for the Dance Plan
holder's date. However, if for some unforeseen reason a person
doesn't have a date, the average price per concert for the holder
of the Dance Plan is twice the amount he would have to pay
if he could buy individual tickets.

Now let's look at the situation for Springs Weekend.
Tickets for each of the concerts were sold for $2.50 apiece.
This means that anyone (not just a W&L student) and his
date could attend the Friday and Saturday night concerts for
$10—the exact same amount that a Dance Plan holder had
to pay for the weekend concerts. In addition, the holder of
the Dance Plan may have even paid more if he missed one
or more of the concerts of Openings or Fancy Dress.

It is apparent that students who do not own Dance Plans
got a good deal Springs Weekend, whereas those who bought
the Dance Plans (to save money, we were told) were gypped.

We don’t know who determined the price for the indi-
vidual tickets for Springs Weekend. But one thing is certain.
The Executive Committee or the Dance Board will have to
guarantee the student body that if individual tickets are sold
for individual concerts, they will cost substantially more than
the equivalent price for a Dance Plan holder. Otherwise, there
will be no advantages to owning Dance Plans, and they will
disappear. As Dance Plans disappear, so do good entertainers

Letters to the Fditor...

The Honor System
Needs A New Name

To the Editor:

On Wednesday, March 19, the
Executive Committee had a Bitch-In
on the Honor System which a hand-
ful of students attended, At the meet-
ing several changes were discussed.
Out of all this, | have only one small
modification to suggest.

My proposal is simple, necessitat-
ing only a change of title. I think for
honesty’s sake that the name of the
Honor Code should be change to
the Code of Minimal Good Behavior.

Why? Because there is no “Honor”
System under either the present pro-
cedures or any modification suggested
of it. Under the present system if
a person is caught cheating on his
age at the ABC store, he would prob-
ably not be convicted of an honor

 

violation. Under any of the proposed
systems, he unfortunately would not
be.

“Why should he be?” you cry.
Should he be kicked out of school
for a little thing like that?” No, I
reply, but under no definition could
you call his action honorable (unless
you could count honor among
thieves). He may be up with the
times and just doing what everyone
else is and perhaps this makes his
action less offensive, but it does not
make it honorable. His action could
not fall within an “Honor” Code.

The new proposals and the old
methods of enforcement assume that
the person has been dishonorable;
they just want to know if he was
dishonorable enough to be expelled.
And of course these liberalizers are
completely correct, but let’s be fair
to the few starry-eyed high school
seniors who find the word honor an

 

attraction. Open their eyes, do not
let them think people still aspire to
ideals.

And we certainly would not want
to discourage those academically quali-
fied people from attending simply be-
cause the word honor repels them.
We must let both groups know that
as long as you are averagely dis-
honest, you can get by. By chang-
ing the Code’s name we could give
these people notice and at the same
time accurately define the system we
live under.

Nation Attacks Hamill’s Arguments

 

—

A Sane Look at Coeducation

By MIKE NATION

I have a strong bias against articles
in reply to articles. However, Jim
Hamill’s column on coeducation in
a recent paper cannot go without
comment because it expresses the
feeling of a great many students.

The purpose of my article is not
necessarily to advocate coeduction.
Rather, it is to appeal for the use
of reason and intellectual detachment
in dealing with this emotionally over-
toned issue,

Mr. Hamill, lamentably, must
serve as an example of how not to
discuss coeducation. His facts are
often inaccurate or irrelevant. The
critical issues are glossed over by un-
warrented assumptions and an ad-
mittedly impressive rhetoric.

First, the facts. Mr. Hamill tells
us that W&L’s graduate school en-
trances will drop if coeducation is
instituted, Statistics of coed liberal
arts schools in terms of percentage
of graduates entering post-graduate
education don't substantuate this. A
sampling reads: Carleton 70 percent,
Earlham 45 percent, Berea 45 per-
cent (has more females than males),
Ripon 50 percent, Oberlin 65 percent.
It appears, rather, that the affinity for
post-graduate study is peculiar for an
individual school and not a factor of
seX mix,

The same point can be made con-
cerning attrition. (Just as an aside,
what does Lindenwood College, a
midwestern, denominational girls
school of litthe academic repute have
to do with coeducational W&L?) At-
trition rates seem also to be indigen-
ous to a given school. Additionally
Washington and Lee's attrition rate
has been about 30 percent, contrary
to Mr. Hamill’s implication of a much
lower rate.

Another inaccuracy concerns edu-
cation courses. Hamill writes of a
preponderance of education cours-
es in girls’ schools in general is more |
or less irrelevant to a coeducational |
situation. An examination of coed |
schools reveals no such large educa- |
tion departments.

 

| ing on new, attractive dorms.

Secondly, even the four surround-
ing girls’ schools have no major in
education and no large curriculum
in this area. Hollins has one in-!
structor and four courses.

More substantively, Mr. Hamill |
makes some questionable assump- |
tions. First, he assumes that the cur-|
rent situation in many areas is static
and apparently correct. He does not)
question whether it is wrong and|
deleterious to arbitrarily exclude
women. He does not question, in more
general terms, the question of mascu-

 

linity as exhibited here. He does not
question whether its concept is dying,
e.g. whether more and more women
will be entering heretofore nearly ex-
clusively male fields.

Further Mr. Hamill assumes that
coeducation would come with reten-
tion of current size, Conversation with
knowledgable faculty and administra-
tion reveal this assumption to be
unwarranted,

Mr. Hamill asserts that coeducation
would result in gross curriculum

(Continued on Page 4)

 

illegal. The possession of marijuana
is a

federal crime involving upon
conviction a sentence in a federal
jail.

Many students know of friends who
have smoked “grass” and, also, know
of some of the raids that have been
held on campus (raids by school
officials not federal narcotic agents).
There are probably narcotic agents in
the Lexington area keeping surveil-
lance,

Continued use by students, it seems
to me, is asking for more and more
trouble. Sooner or later federal nar-
cotic agents (not school officials) will
be conducting raids and many of the
W&L’s gentlemen will wind up in
federal penitentiaries. When you
smoke that “mary jane,” think about
the possible consequences to W&L’s
reputation and your own. This is not
to say pot heads do not appear on
other campuses. However, I think it
is in W&L’s tradition as gentlemen to
uphold the law and to not continue
this open violation of the law,

On Campaign Posters
To the Friday R-t Phi Editor:

I decline to comment on the lack
of interest in the current elections
for student body officers. 1 would,
however, wish to comment on our
“tradition” of multi-colored campaign
posters. Every spring this campus
takes on the appearance of a cheap
bazaar when posters of all sorts are
tacked, taped, or nailed to anything
or everything within reach. The news-
paper does a fine job of informing
the students of the candidates. Do we
really need all those posters? I think
not, Brandon C, Martin, °69

 

The Freshman’s Dilemma

By DAVE OLSON |
This time every year just about
every freshman starts thinking about
transfering or leaving W&L. He is
dissatisfied with the lack of women
on campus, with the intellectual at-
mosphere, with the overly strict dorm
regulations and the freshman year in
general. What can be done to cor-
rect this?

The biggest problem is the fact
that the freshmen, for the entire first
year are set off in their corner of
the campus with very little contact
with upperclassmen. Even with fra-
ternities, most of the year is spent
with freshmen in the dorms and in

class. This is probably the major
contributing factor to freshman
alienation. This isolation not only

makes the freshman year unpleasant
but also leads to apathy later in a
student’s time at W&L. The way this
happens is that when a_ student
finishes his first year he is already
dissatified with archaic distribution
requirements and general campus dis-
unity and these problems seem so
overwhelming that he is resigned to
three more years where there is no
real way to change. The answer to)
the problem of freshman alienation.
and student apathy in general is an}
extensive building program  center-

 

 

 

What this will do is bring upper-
classmen back to the campus. These
new dorms must be attractive, with
suite set-ups, liberal parietal hours
and no liquor regulations. They must
be attractive to upperclassmen so that
they will want to live in them. In-
stead of the students only coming
to campus to go to class, they will
be living and eating on campus. This
will bring together the entire student
body. The freshmen will have greater
contact with upperclassmen and up-
perclassmen will be brought together
themselves. Now the majority of
upperclassmen live in apartments
spread all over the county.

The entire student body is together
only on rare occasions and then for
only short periods of time. There is
no interaction, no intermingling and
no conversation and exchange of
ideas between students save those in
the same fraternity and that group is
a restricted group. The key to in-
creased intellectuality and the elimina-
tion of student apathy on this campus
is this increased intermingling of stu-
dents. Dormitories close to campus
would be the best way for the uni-
versity to bring students back to
campus and the increased interaction
of students and the resultant exchange
of ideas

 

student concern, and

intellectuality.

With the upperclassmen back on
campus and the atmosphere of the
campus changed by the dorms, the
freshman year will not only be tol-
erable but very possibly enjoyable.
If the proposed curriculum changes
pass next month the freshman year
will lose some of its dullness and
the freshmen should become more
interested in their courses; and with
interested students, the faculty will
not dread teaching freshmen.

With these changes and the addi-
tion of upperclass dorms, the fresh-
man would not only enjoy his first
year but would be excited about the
years to come at W&L. Upperclass
dorms would not only aid the fresh-
men in getting to know the upper-
classmen but would also help the
campus as a whole, restoring campus
unity, undermining apathy and in-
creasing contact and the exchange of
ideas between students which would
lead to a much more intellectual at-
mosphere than exists now, With a 2.2
million dollar gym going up I would
suggest that upperclass dorms would
not only be an addition to the physi-
cal beauty of the campus but might
also do more for the student body

involvement,

 

“Sister George” Lives On

By ROBERT J, BAROODY

!
The absurdity of the “teaser film” |
Romeo and Juliet only reached
me halfway through the State's pres-
ent offering, The Killing of Sister,
George. “No ordinary love story,”
booms the narrator, assuring Us that
only in Shakespearean Verona did six-
teen year olds get in bed together,

Ridiculous! Whether the subject is
a homosexual Sergeant. pubescent
lovers, or two raving lesbians, when

In any case, both of Lexington’s

| Neer Sets State Jump Record;
, Generals Drop Two Close Meets

By WALT POTTER

Washington and Lee’s cindermen
fell before the suprising Hampden-
Sydney thinclads in a home meet
Wednesday afternoon, 77-68. Com-
ing up with surprises in the weight
events and an outstanding perform-
ance by Dudley Patterson, Hampden-
Sydney clinched the meet in the last
event, the mile relay. Going into the
mile relay W&L had a chance to win
after gaining six points in the late fin-
ishing high jump, as Mike Neer took
his usual first place with 62” effort,
but stellar performances by Neer and
Hinkle were not enough to pull out
the tight meet.

Hampend-Sydney’s performance in
the weight events was the key to
breaking W&L’s usual predominance
in field events, H-S'’s Bob Unrue
captured both the discus and the
shot-put as Ben Williams and Doug
of W&L were second and
third respectively in the shot and H-S
swept the discus, In the javelin Mike
Carrere captured his fifth consecutive
dual meet victory with a toss of 168°
2” and Jay Passavant took third, but
H-S broke up the usual W&L sweep
of the event by taking second place.

WA&L’s field prowess returned in
the other events. Bob Faust captured
the pole valut again by catapulting
himself over the 12° mark, with Tom
Billups bagging a second for the Gen-
erals. Bill Kahn got his fifth con-
secutive long jump victory with a
leap of 21°41” as Mike Neer added
to his laurels by taking second in this
event. Neer also captured second in
the triple jump with Kahon éarning
third place.

Hinkle led the way for the Gen-
erals in the running events. He cap-
tured both the 440 yard dash (51.9)
and the 220 yard dash (23.1) and
anchored the 440 yard relay team
to victory (45.0). Don Marshall took
first in the 120 yard high hurdles in

 

16.1, and Bruce Wilsie was first in
the 100 in 10.4,
In the distance events Patterson

gave W&L a hard time. He won the
880 and then beat W&L’s outstand-
ing distance man Harry Zeliff in both
the mile and two mile, winning the
mile and finishing in a veritable tie
with teammate Martin Willis. Willis
also was second in the mile to force
Zeliff down to third in both events.

Thursday afternoon saw the sec-
ond defeat in two days for the
| W&L thinclads, as Old Dominion won
| by a score of 79-67. Both meets were
very close.

WAL’'s strength in the field events
waned for the second day as Old
Dominion swept both the

 

 

shotput |

Washingion and Lee University
Bonkstore

and pole vault. In the javelin, Mike
Carrere placed first and Billy Ball
place third for W&L. Doug Deaton
captured a second in the discus for
the Generals’ only place.

The high jump was a surprise, as
Mike Neer, who in the last week has
been in five meets, came out with
only a tie at 68” with his OD
adversary. On Monday, Mike captured
the State high jump crown with a
leap of 6'7%, a new state record.
Last weekend Mike jumped 6'734” at

the Penn Relays. Today he is compet- |

ing in the Quantico Relays in Quan-
tico, Virginia.

The broad jump was captured by
Bill Kahn for his sixth consecutive
win. John Glace placed third in the
broad jump but placed first in the
triple jump, with Rob Faust close
behind in second. In the 120 yard
high hurdles, Drew Thomas and Don
Marshall captured second and _ third
respectively.

In the sprints W&L did fairly well.
Wilsie took the 100 yard dash in
10.5 with Baker taking third. Sam
Hinkle took first in the 200 yard
dash with Baker bagging another
third. Hinkle placed second in the
440 for the only place in that event
for the Generals.

The 880 and mile runs were weak
spots. Steve Darsie captured a third
in the 880, with OD completely

sweeping the mile. In the two mile
Harry Zeliff, ace distance runner,
took first with the other two places
going to OD.

Ihe two teams split the relays, OD
picking up five points in the mile
relay with W&L coming in second.
(This is comparable to Hubert
Humphrey saying, “Well, I ran sec-
ond anyway.”) W&L captured the 440
relay to close out the meet.

Golfers Play
Tough Schedule

This was an active week
W&L golf team as the
participated in two matches.

Monday, the General — golfers
travelled to the famous Cascades
courses in Hot Springs for the State

for the
linksmen

Golf Tournament. A_ strong V.P.I.
team walked away with the team
honors. The W&L team finished a

strong fifth. Ken Carter led the team
with a 79-79-158 over a very tough
thirty-six holes. The golfers finished
in fifth place last year.

Wednesday, the Generals traveled
to Roanoke, where, in a dissappoint-
ing match, W&L lost to Roanoke
College for the first time ever in this
sport. This loss dropped the team’s
record to 4-3. Jim Gordon’s 78 was
the low round of the day, as he
and Bob Matthews were the only
Generals to win their matches. The
Roanoke course was a new tough
one, measuring over 7,000 yards.

rhis afternoon the Generals travel-
ed to Staunton to meet Bridgewater
College for a 1 p.m. match. After
this afternoon's match, the golfers
meet Lynchburg College Monday in
a home match.

author George

English = mystery
Symons will speak at
Lee next week on
Orwell.

Besides more than 20 mystery and
crime novels of his own, Symons
reviews other crime novels regularly
for the London Sunday Times,

He will lecture at 8:15 p.m. Tues-
day (May 6) in duPont Auditorium,
His appearance is sponsored by the
University’s Seminars in Literature
program and is open to the public.

In addition to his mysteries, Symons
has writen a number of historical
and critical studies, among them “A.
J. A. Symons” (1950), “Charles
Dickens” (1961), “Thomas Carlyle”
(1962), “The General Strike” (1957),
“The Thirties” (1960) and “The De-
tective Story in Britain” (1962),

He also has published a book of
poems, “The Second Man” (1944)

NOTICES

The Executive Committee of the
Student Body is presently accepting
applications for membership, includ-
ing chairman, on each of the follow
ing student committee: Student Con-
trol, Cold Check, Assimilation,
Library, and Curriculum. Applications
should be submitted to Chuck Dob-

either between the two 12 week
semesters or after them, in the spring.
Integral to both proposals was the
reduction of graduation requirements
from 123 to 115 hours. The normal
course load for the 12-week semesters
will be 12 credits, 3-6 for the short
term,

Both plans put first term exams
before Christmas. The 12-12-6 plan,
which was adopted, ends the second
term just before spring vacation, The
year will end at approximately the
same time, and students will be re-
quired to register for all three terms,

rhe curriculum changes have been
submitted to an Implementation Com-
mittee, which is composed of the
membership of the Faculty Curricu-
lum Committee, to make preparations
for implementation of the innovations
by the fall of 1970. Most of the
work will have to be completed nearly
a year in advance in order for the
1970 catalogue to include the changes.

Parietals and Unit of Credit

The faculty will convene for their
regular meeting Monday, and among
the items for consideration is the
remaining Curriculum Committee
and a proposal relaxing parietal and

Ihe faculty in its scheduled meet-

the Student Affairs Committee's pro-
posed reforms of the dormitory parie-

Dean Atwood, in reporting the
SAC’s recommendations to the fac- |

 

 

ington Literary Society at Washing-
ton and Lee during his senior year
as the student who had contributed
most to the University.

He will succeed Dr. Edward C.
Atwood Jr., who has been the Uni-
versity’s Dean of Students since 1962.
Dr. Atwood was designated last week
to succeed the retiring Dr. Lewis W.
Adams as Dean of the School of
Commerce and Administration.

After receiving his B.A. degree at
Washington and Lee, John studied
political economy for a year at the
University of Edinburgh in Scotland
on a Fulbright Scholarship

He joined Washington and Lee's
administrative staff in 1963 As
sistant Dean of Students and Director
of Student Financial Aid. He was also

as

an instructor in economics,

Last August, John returned to
Washington and Lee to assume his
current position. He has served as

chairman of the university’s student

financial aid committee and as a
member of the admissions and stu-
dent affairs committees.

Dean Frank J. Gilliam, the first
Dean of Students, served in that
position from its creation in 1931

until his retirement in February of
1962. He also served concurrently as
the first Dean of Admissions. Mr
Gilliam joined the faculty in 1926
at a post in the English Department.
As Dean of Students, he instituted
many programs. He is the “founding
father” of Freshman Camp. It was he
who established the faculty advisor
program and the current policy of
requiring freshmen to live in the
dorms. He was also a strong sup
porter of fraternity-college relations

Upon Dean Gilliam’s retirement in
1962, Dr. Edward C. Atwood was
appointed to the position, Dr. Atwood

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

DEAN ATWOOD MOVES UP —

A FEW REASONS WHY REGRET
WOULD NOT BE

AN INAPPROPRIATE EMOTION

This is an editorial bordering on the type a college editor
generallly rejects—people have been walking into this office
suggesting comendatons for everyone; students, faculty, and
administrators. Yet propriety deems that a student choose
very carefully which of his elders he will discuss in these
columns. And after writing that, all trepidation has been
catharsized . . .

For seven years Professor E. C. Atwood, Jr. has served
as Dean of Students. We have known him for but three of
those years, and in that time his image has been—as are the
images of most Deans of students—a vascillating one. “Dean
Atwood’s a (good) (bad) guy.’ Choose one.

But the choice has too often depended on the circumstances
at hand—few of us stop to remember that Dean Atwood is
just that: Dean Atwood. And he has performed his duties as
Dean much to our liking.

All most of us see of him is 1) when we’re in trouble,
or 2) at an IFC meeting (where rumormongering is at its
height). As for 1), do we want a Dean who will say, ‘Well,
you blew up the New Dorm last night, but I’m sure it’s
due to questions of your environment, and we all make
mistakes .. .”’? No! We want—or at least this editor wants—
a Dean who will be fair but firm, as Dean Atwood has been.

In regard to 2), the IFC is not a body to which the Dean
should speak in tones of social grace about the many redeem-
ing qualities of fraternities—he should be the faculty’s ad-
vocate, which he is. And, just ask any professor; in a faculty
meeting he is the students’ advocate.

In our humble opinion, Professor Atwood has performed
his duties as Dean of Students in a competent fashion, and
at the same time has maintained the students’ interests at
heart. We wish him well in his new post.

THE LAST OF TWO EC COMMENDATIONS
A WORD OF APPRECIATION TO

PETE HENDRICKS

AND

DANNY LEONARD

Two weeks ago this edition recognized publicly what
many had realized all year, that the President of the Student
Body had led the Executive Committee dutifully and more
than capably in his term and deserved a special word of
thanks.

There are two others on the EC who should be com-
mended, not only for taking their task as seriously as it
should have been taken, but for adding an inexplicable extra
something to the meetings—call it what you will: decorum,
style, a will to serve. These are men who will not be serving
next year; one because he will be working in Atlanta, the
other for personal reasons. Next year’s editors may or not
wish to laud such outstanding men as Joe Tompkins but we
shall confine our comments to non-returning men.

The first of these is Pete Hendricks, Senior / Intermediate
representative from the Law School. The second is Danny
Leonard, junior representative.

We would like to say glorious, memorable things about
Pete and Danny, but we won’t because we don’t think they
want to hear them now. Perhaps it would suffice to say they
tired to be impartial about the EC this year—we have attended
nearly every meeting, with the intention first of reporting
and (peripherally) of observing the men themselves. We
will not delude you, or ourself, by proclaiming the virtues
of these gentlemen’s opinions, for in all cases we have not
agreed with them.

But what's important is that Pete and Danny have acted
on their best judgment, which, as it turns out, is judgment
articulated only after careful consideration, What more can
we, as students, ask of our leaders? Not much. And yet
these qualities of temperance and debate with oneself are all
too rare among EC members.

Many times this year it has occurred to us that every
W&L student should attend at least one EC meeting; the
meetings are not what one mght suspect. Yet throughout,
Pete and Danny have conducted themselves and their affairs
in a manner which does justice to their high positions.

To paraphrase the words of a recent Friday edition edi-
torial, we are not castigating anyone; we are trying to be
positive. Omissions? Sure, Only one or so of the 12-man com-
mittee was a recognizably poor member, and so we have chosen
those whom we deem, as influential or non-influential a deemer

as we are, to be the better of the good.

AND YET ANOTHER COMMENDATION,
THE DEBATE TEAM AND MR. CHAFFIN

While we're on the subject of commendations, it would
only be fair to mention Mr. Chaffin's debate team, This
would be a news story and not an editorial if we were to re-
capitulate the 23 trophies and certificates won in 23 tourna-
ments or to re-tell the virtues of the John Reynolds-Tim
Wright team—but it should be pointed out, nevertheless, that
what was described in late May of last year as a “rebuilding
year” has turned out to be a phenomenon on the order of
pre-fab construction.

The team usually wins only limited coverage by the news-
paper (even though Mr. Chaffin _ by the office with a
story almost every Monday night), and the trophies are quietly
dsplayed in the foyer of Payne Hall.

And as is the case with all teams, the coach deserves most

of the credit.

This Review
Written In The Hand Of
A Man Who Enjoyed The

Book

By JEFFREY WEXLER
Columnist

Not ever having had a book pub-
lished, nor yet again ever having
enrolled in one of Dr. Ollinger J.
Crenshaw’s courses, I was chosen by
my editor as thus being uniquely
qualified to review “General Lee’s
College.”

The work is particularly beautiful,
being the product of research cover-
ing more years than I have been
alive. It is a book that leaves the
reader, especially the friend of Wash-
ington and Lee, with mixed feelings.
There are satisfactions and there are
regrets.

The process of the work is from
our mystery-enshrouded beginnings in
1749 to 1930 with a minute epilogue
bringing one to less ancient times of
the 1960's, This, to me, was most
lamentable. | should have appreciat-
ed an account of the last third of a
century in depth, precision, and wit
equal to that of the previous 181
years. This omission was, of course,
not an oversight on the part of Dr.
Crenshaw, Many many of the people
as intimate to the events of the years
of Presidents Gaines and Cole and
Huntley as is Dr. Crenshaw are still
involved with the present and have
hopes for the future. To set down
their histories, a senior gentleman of
the faculty informed me, Dr. Cren-
shaw felt, would lead to problems
avoidable by committing the sin of
omission, One hopes, however, that
these chapters omitted exist in manu-
script form and will be published
eventually in a revised edition. Such
chapters would be invaluable primary
source data,

This same faculty gentleman has
characterized Professor Crenshaw’s
prose as one of a “scholarly nature”
and a “graceful wit.” With certain
humility, | concur. “General Lee's
College” is good reading. It reads as
Cassius Clay (the present one) fights:
“float like a butterfly, sting like a
bee.” The progress of the book is
never bogged in turgid prose and
viscous statistics. The biographical
sketches are sharp and revealing. One
cites the passages on Louis Marshall—
to remind the reader of this review
that the admonition “Plus ca change.
. . .” applies to education and to
Washington and Lee as well, One cites
the passages on Louis Marshall as
illustration of Dr. Crenshaw’s talent.

The story mounts as an execution
well-laid out: “Classes were abolished
save for voluntary association by two
or more pupils, and even then in-
structional sessions lasted only as long
as the students wished.” Dr, Marshall
attempted to be “one of the boys,”
we are told, “meeting them on their
own terms.” And then comes William
H. Ruffner's obiter dictum of Mar-
shall; “As likely as not,” Dr. Cren-
shaw quotes Ruffner as saying, “the
visitor would find him during recita-
tion lolling in his bed [in his class-
room|, pipe in mouth . . . the to-
bacco smoke rivalling in density a
London fog.” Then Professor Cren-
shaw spring his trap: “Soon afterward
{Dr. Marshall] left for Kentucky,
never to return, without bothering to
resign or explain.” Such is Dr. Cren-
shaw’s style.

Of course, the chapters concerning
General Lee are of primary interest.
On a shopping spree at Christmas 1
foolishly invested a 59-cent portion
of my patrimony in a bargain table
copy of Marshall W. Fishwick's “Lee
After the War” (which, according to
Virginia Kirkus, “fills an empty
space.”) I rely too on Douglas South-
all Freeman's magnificent “R. E. Lee,”
published some years before Dr.
Fishwick’s work, which, at least by
Miss Kirkus’ standards did not fill the
“empty space” well enough. There are
numerous ways to look at a topic.
While Dr. Freeman viewed our col-
lege from the standpoint of Lee, Dr.
Crenshaw views Lee from the stand-
point of our college, To one, Wash-
ingion College was an aspect, albeit
an important one, in the life of a
great hero. To the other, Lee was an
wspect, possibly the most important
one, in the life of a great college.
Hoth views have merit in the absence
of duplication and in the wealth of
primary data, Dr. Fishwick, who
spent a decade some years ago, teach-
ing everything at Washington and
Lee, admonishes us, “Do not ex-
pect to find in this litthe book much

 

that Douglas Southall Freeman has

He's right. Nevertheless, one remains

 

faithful that “this little book” fills
an empty space on someone’s book-
shelf somewhere . . . adequately but
not well. There are only two chapters
on General Lee in “General Lee’s
College, but they are the pivot. Stu-
dents and scholars (a redundancy at
this school of course) can delight in
them. There is the story of the
Union army veteran E. C. Johnston
coming to Lexington to establish
Negro schools as an agent of the
American missionary association and
his letter condemning Washington
College as such missive appeared in
the press. Dr. Crenshaw, recounting
the tale in measured word, con-
cludes, “A crowd of students gathered
about [Johnston] and insulted him.
He appealed for military protection,
but General Lee, Judge Brocken-
brough, Mayor Ruff, and John
Letcher persuaded federal authorities
not to send troops. Never had he
lived in such a town where drunken
students roamed the streets at night,
firing pistols and uttering threats.”
(“Plus ca change .. .” encore?) Then
Professor Crenshaw springs the trap
—again. He quotes a United States
Army officer stationed in Lynchburg
at the time and intimate with the
details of the case: “The officer de-
fended General Lee, who had acted
vigorously, and charged that Johns-
ton had drawn a pistol on a twelve-
year-old boy.”

I cannot recommend “General Lee’s
College.” My dubious qualifications as
a reviewer of the book do not in-
clude that prerogative. However, I
intend to buy a second copy and a
third copy and would encourage you
(you-all?) to do the same. “General
Lee’s College” does the old man
honor,

Stalk Of The School:

Speaks Of
HIGH POLITICS ON
CAMPUS.

What A Great Story
This Is.

By A. WOOLLCOTT, IR,
Writer

POSTED NOTES FROM ALL
OVER, or, Spring is Sprung and So
Are the Politicians.

I was on campus recently (which
should surprise some of my profes-
sors) and spent several minutes stroll-
ing about, viewing with alarm, “The
Hill,” as Washington and Lee stu-
dents call it, is never more beautiful
than in the Springtime (1 have been
told), and one can well believe it.
For successive weeks at this time,
WAL becomes a school of well-dress-
ed lemmings, almost all of them
running for office.

An invitation arrived at the city
desk of the R-t P to join the cam-
paign trains of several of the half
million candidates running. Sequest-
ering a hat in the ringful 1 proceeded
to seek out several of the more bless-
ed to listen to the thunder of their
cannonizations,

Now, speaking of oratorical bomb-
blasts, my Irish mother’s Gaelic father
was a man of wise advice. He was
a bigot, however, and in light of the
current proceedings in Lexington,
City of Man, one is hesitant at quot-
ing the old Mick, Without rational
reason, he was consistently against
Englishmen regardless of religion or
politics.

With this fault of character (as
some will consider it, they being
English, which is not their fault, or
Anglophiles, which is a mark of pro-
nounced mental disability), under-
stood, One can accept my grandpa’s
prediliction for infernal machines,
things that go boom in the night.
He was very fond of direct action,
explaining when the tide of John
Jameson (a far better mocker than
Lord Blarney) ran high in his blood,
“Keep you mouth shut, boys, ‘ceptin
as when you've a glass in yer hand.”

This being integral to the establish-
ment of any alcoholic’s career, the
flow of words and juice being com-
plementary, | went, credo in hand,
to visit firstly the headquarters of
candidates in the immediate neighbor-
hood. Thus it was that I took the
Reid Hall elevator to the plush pent-
house offices of Larry Honig, Editor
of this Journal, The guard, sten gun
in hand, mistook me for Howard
Hughes (who consults fellow-Texan
Honig frequently fellow-Texan Honig
later informed me). He let me pass.
There, behind an orange crate that
Editor Honig had fashioned from a
Louis Quatorze mahogany escritoire,
sat The Man himself, surrounded by
cases of RC’s and moon pies. Behind
him stood R, Machiavelli Byrum. his
political counsel. Col, Byrum, Dr,
Honig informed me, offering me a
shot of pure white lightning in a
cut glass Dixie cup, is a candidate
for the office of Vice President of the
School of Arts and Sciences, Class
of 1970, Profewor Honig, Candidate
Byrum added, has indeed allowed his
name to be presented to the grubby
sweaty in the EC elections for the

omitted from his four huge volumes.” | same Class of 1970, “Tends to be,”

appended the Great Man himself,

 

fingering his red, white, and blue
galluses. “Mr. Hughes, your multi-
millionaireship,” began Col. Byrum,
noted connoissuer of horse and wo-
men flesh. I corrected this mistake
and perceiving a sudden chill and the
presence of the same stormtrooper
who'd greeted me at the elevator, I
beat a hasty retreat,

Jeb Brown not running for office,
I decided to visit his successor in
the Theatre of Political Melodrama,
John Richard, No, I take that back
(as a former handball champion of
Rockbridge County might say, “strike
that.”). Comparing Jeb Brown to
John Richard is like comparing Aida
to the H.M.S. Pinafore. I was greeted
at the gate to his fabulous campaign
palace by a giant Nubian wearing the
Hapsburg colors. I noticed a Union
Jack flying over the castle( an edifice
bearing startling resemblence to the
Lime Kiln) and, with a sense of
prejudice similar to my grandfather's,
I, refusing to associate myself with
oppressive minority groups and Ang-
lophiliacs, turned and left.

Discovering the other candidates all
to be fictitious and non-existant ex-
cept as seen through the rosy paper
on their posters, | returned to the
blessed security of my desk in the
Lexington offices of the R-tum Phi.
P.S. This column was not printed last
week at the request of Editor/Candi-
date Honig.

And Here’s Another
FANTASTIC STORY
About Campus Politicians.

By LAURENCE M. HILLIARD
Columnist

Class elections have come and
gone for another year, and unless
you happen to be a freshman, you
must have had the feeling that you
were reviewing a summer repeat. Ex-
cept for some of the names, every-
thing was the same as last year, and
the year before, and the year before
that, probably back to 1749. The
ruins of Liberty Hall, back during
their more functioning days, were un-
doubtedly liberally covered with
multi-colored campaign flyers.

Campaign 1969 had the same cam-
paign posters as untold elections be-
fore, with their brag sheets (varsity
leap frog, palm readers club, SDS,
YAF) and their same stale campaign
slogans (Progressive, Responsible,
Leadership”). And every candidate
promises the same things (liberaliza-
tion of dormitory regulations, an in-
dependent exam schedule, etec.).

After a year at W&L, you would
think the freshman should realize that
the positions of class president and
vice-president are, nothing but social
positions—after Openings Weekend,
the sophomore president might as
well go into hibernation, One candi-
date campaigned for Sophomore Class
President with flyers that proclaimed
that he is:

For Liberalized distribution require-

ments

For a coed exchange program

For more liberal dorm and fra-

ternity regulations concerning
girls

For a W&L popular movie program
Another candidate for the same office
had a six-point program that includ-
ed points that were equally as dis-
tant from the office of a class presi-
dent. Students campaigning for class
president on such platforms are about
as ridiculous as Louis Nunn com-
paigning for governor of Kentucky on
the platform that the Johnson Ad-
ministration was mishandling the war
in Vietnam. The fact that Nunn was
elected and the two freshmen were
defeated probably shows that the
WAL freshman is more politically
astute that the Kentucky hillbilly,
which might or might not be a
worthwhile distinction,

The results of the class elections
were just about as expected. All the
STUDS were elected. Incumbents had
no trouble getting re-elected. Honig
continued to make a reputation as
the William Jennings Bryan of WAL.

| have voted in my election at
WAL, a fact that hardly saddens me.
if | had it all to do over again
(heaven forbid!), | would vote for
the candidates who said the least,
put up the fewest posters, and most
especially, for any candidate who
said or did anything original,

duPont Art Exhibit
Receives These
RAVE REVIEWS.
Students At W&L Have
Been Performing

Wonderfully.

ty KIRK WOODWARD
Critic

This years WAL Student Art Ex-
hibit has taken up residence in du-
Pont Hall's main corridor (mistakenly
called an art gallery), and will re-
main there through May 30. The
show is a good one, well worth
seeing

A common theme unites the ex-
hibit, demonstrated in pieces like Carr
Garnett's “Vepco,” which shows the

 

telephone and power wires outside
the W&L art studio window, and in
pieces of sculpture made entirely of
automobile pistons, nails, and weld-
ed bumpers. The common theme is
that of the specific object, especially
the machine or the art work. This
theme makes itself known in some
ingenious ways.

Some art works literally make ob-
jects their subject: Mark Faverman’s
“Eleanor” is a painting behind a
battered old window-frame. Some
present the operation of objects:
Larry Mann has assembled two
heavy iron wheels in a construction
called “Gatling II” which has moving
parts and makes a wonderful low
rumbling noise when rolled. Others
make comments on _ objects: the
“African Mask” painted by James
Maloney is surounded by a yellow-
orange backgound suggesting fire and
heat; the fire also peeps through the
mask’s eyes. Some are works making
comments on their own material.
Robert Trotman has done a painting
in which the crucified Christ’s torso
seems to be really suspended in space,
a feat accomplished through skillful
use of color.

The dominant painting style of the
exhibit also effects close attention to
colors with little or no shading; back-
grounds are simple areas of pastels
with no details. Presented in this way,
machines like Robert Martin’s loco-
motive “Toy” acquire a new import-
ance; they seem to be a whole world
in themselves.

The exhibit has no essays on the
Vietnam War and only one, a piece
of sculpture, on love. The reason for
these ommisions is significant and
points to the basis of the exhibit’s
success, Student art tends to be im-
passioned, generalized, and vague, so
a teacher who directs a student's at-
tention to technique and to the speci-
fic performs a service. As proof, the
material in this exhibit which depends
on feeling—the social consciousness
work—is compositionally flabby for
the most part. (An exception is Mot
Wright's “Summertime,” a painting of
a helmeted policeman and the atmo-
sphere surrounding him.)

But when the artists pay attention
to specifics, the benefits flow. The
artists represented in this exhibit are
able to utilize a wide range of tech-
nical resources. Robert Lytle, for ex-
ample, draws on the paintings of
centuries ago; and the surface of
Peter Zimmermann’s “Earth Con-
tours” looks and feels like its subject.
The exhibit can also be funny. Carr
Garnett has a dramatic painting of
a stoplight, called, appropriately,
“Spotlight.” Larry Mann has made
an excellent chess set (called “Chess
Set") on which Mr. Dave Hall was
recently seen winning a game.

The exhibit is a sign that some-
body is doing his job well. “Some-
body” is Mr, Prohaska, whose exhibit
of Mediterranean impressions some
months ago was a landmark, and Mr.
Hall, and the artists who worked and
contributed. But next year the two
teachers will be gone. No one can
feel too comfortabie.

I have saved the best for last.
A star of the show is, of all things,
a realistic picture, L. C. Quin’s “Jul-
ians Hill,” which looks menacing.
Peter Zimmermann’s lovely “Wraith”
and Mot Wright's “Agonda” are also
stars. These three paintings have been
sold or claimed. On the other hand,
Robert Lytle’s cleanly abstract “Las
Mujeres” and James Maloney’'s
“Samurai” are still for sale. So are
two fascinating works, Christopher
Meyer's sculpture “The Clothes His
Maid Wore,” which incidentally has
the best title in the exhibit, and Henry
L. Hill's “1983 The Future Ap-
proaches,” which incidentally has the
worst title, These four are all more
than worth their price. Some others,
too.

Explore Coeducation, Size

Related studies of size and co-
education will be conducted this year
by special University study commit-
tees, President Robert E. R. Huntley
announced ‘Tuesday,

women, or to expand the overall en-
rollment, a step which would involve
increased costs.

The problem of optimum size in-
volves a conflict between the ad-
vantages of opportunities for in-
creased specialization that come with
lageness, and the advantages of close
faculty-student association that de-
rive from smaliness.

“As someone has said, you want
to be big enough to have a_ ball
game and small enough so everyone
can play,” Professor Gunn remarked.

The studies will not touch on the
subject of enrollment in the Schoo!
of Law, the University’s only gradu-
ate division, The law school is con-
ducting its own study of optimum
size.

As a result of largely unplanned
growth, Washington and Lee has
seen its overall enrollment, invouling
both undergraduate and the School
of Law, increase by nearly 400 stu-
dents in the past 10 years. Total
enrollment, including the law school,
was 1,458 at the start of the current
academic year. Most of the increase
has come through reduction in aca-
demic attrition and growth of the
School of Law. A small undergradu-
ate increase resulted in 1965 when the
size of the entering class was raised
by approximately 30.

The coeducation study will parallel
a continuing feasibility study of a stu-
dent exchange program involving
Washington and Lee, four women’s
colleges and three other colleges for
men. “We do not view the coeduca-
tion study as precluding the prospect
of an exchange program,” President
Huntley said.

The president appointed seven fac-
ulty and administration members to
“a committee to study the question
of coeducation. Dr. Louis W. Hodges,
professor of religion, will serve
chairman.

Nine faculty members were ap-
pointed to the committee that will
study the matter of the University’s
future size. In question is whether
undergraduate enrollment should be
smaller or larger than this year's
starting enrollment of 1,272, or sub-
stantially the same. John M. Gunn,
associate professor of economics, will
serve as chairman.

President Huntley said that both
study groups will have student repre-
sentation. Student members to
be named later.

Both committees also anticipate in-
volving alumni in their deliberations
through the medium of the 12-mem-
ber Alumni Board of Directors,
which is elected by the University’s
11,000 living alumni.

Neither committee is charged with
the responsibility of producing a
recommended course of action. In-
stead, the committees are to study
desirability and feasibility of various
alternatives and make reports de-
signed to provide the faculty and ad-
ministration with information that will
be useful in making decisions, the
president noted.

It is hoped that reports from both
committees will be completed by the
end of the current calendar year, an
administration spokesman said. Since
the isues of size of the University and
any possible shift away from single-
sex admissions policies are closely
related, Professors Gunn and Hodges
have indicated that they plan to meet

Dorms Need Refurbishing

Within the past week, the faculty has approved reforms
which will vastly improve the academic and social atmosphere
at Washington and Lee. The academic reforms, which we
discussed last week, will institute a 12-12-6 calendar and liberal
distribution requirements in September 1970. The social re-
forms, passed Monday, will allow alcoholic beverages and
women in the dormitories beginning next September. It is
these latter changes we will discuss at this time.

These latter reforms were first considered by the Student
Affairs Commmittee (SAC) in November following a faculty
resolution to improve living conditions for students in dormi-
tories. The SAC, composed of students, faculty and administra-
tion, visited the dormitories (One member said sarcastically,
“It’s a nice place to visit, but I wouldn’t want to live there.”’),
interviewed freshmen and dormitory counselors, and visited
other campuses to formulate a suitable plan. We feel that the
SAC deserves much praise for the final plan adopted by the
faculty, for it will provide an extension of self-government
in an area in which students should have a voice.

By being more involved in governing their sections, stu-
dents living in dormitories will be given more responsibilities.
For example, the members of each resident section will have
to decide upon and enforce the parietal hours they set for

the section.

There may be several benefits gained from these reforms,
also. They may lessen the pressure put on a freshman to join
a fraternity. By being able to drink liquor and entertain his date
in his own room, he will be provided with a practical al-
ternative (along with the new Student Union) to fraternity
membership and will not be completely excluded from having
a social life. These reforms may also cause dormitory residents
to take better care of their rooms and do less damage to them.

But the largest benefit resulting from these reforms should
come directly from the University. The University has a
perfect opportunity this summer to make the physical condi-
tions in the dormitories more conducive to entertaining guests.
Some suggestions for this general refurbishing program are to
use stronger light bulbs in the halls and rooms and to put
some kind of fixtures over them. Along with this, we recom-
mend repainting the dormitory halls and rooms in brighter
colors to get rid of the gloomy atmosphere which currently
prevails. New window shades should replace the torn, moth-
eaten ones now in the dormitories, and some sort of sound-
proofing should be installed to provide each room with more
privacy. And perhaps some of the old, beat-up desks and chairs
could be replaced with new, comfortable furniture.

This should not be misconstrued as a complete checklist
for refurbishing the dormitories, but it does represent a be-
ginning. The improvements pointed out are sorely needed if
these reforms are to work well. We do not believe that anyone
should be embarrassed to entertain his date in his room be-
cause it is ugly and uncomfortable or because it offers no

privacy.

Writing A University’s History

(Editor's Note: The following are
excerpts from the speech to be
presented by Professor Ollinger
Crenshaw tonight at 8 o'clock in
duPont Auditorium.)

By OLLINGER CRENSHAW
University Historian

When I agreed to undertake the
assignment of writing a history of
Washington and Lee, many years ago,
1 was well aware of the problems
and pitfalls which might confront
the historian, though perhaps not all
all of them. Having been trained in
the historical seminars at Johns Hop-
kins, | planned to apply the critical
method in gathering, organizing, and
writing up my materials.

his being so, and the story of the
rise and growth of what became
eventually Washington and Lee Uni-
versity covering the entire nineteenth
century, with portions of the eigh-
teenth and a half century of the
twentieth, | began a search for what
historians call “source materials”
upon which to build my history.

Unfortunately for me, the official
materials of the era prior to 1770
are thin indeed, and were supple-
mented by investigation in Virginia
manuscripts elsewhere. The trustees’
minutes and papers proved to be re-
warding, and as the years passed
more full and useful. The manu-
script minutes of the faculty did not
begin until about 1842, and _ these,
though full of minutiae (in the tire-
some manner of the petty agenda of
faculty meetings), were of prime im-
portance to me, Other manuscript
collections at Washington and Lee,
such as the invaluable William Flem-
ing Papers, and of course the R. E.
Lee Collection were essential; and
Lexingtonians came forward with
family papers and suggestions,

Although my history was and is in

 

also. found — excellent manuscript
sources at the New York Public Li-
brary, at the Witherspoon Building
in Philadelphia, at Historical Society
of Pennsylvania, and at the Library
of Congress. The Howard-Tilton  Li-

brary at Tulane contained the Wil-
liam Preston Johnston Papers, ex-
cellent on the period of the Lees.

Perhaps I may be permitted a little
excursion into an experience I had
in one of the above mentioned librar-
ies, Which shall remain nameless. I
encountered a series of letters from
a youth who had been a student at
Washington College to a former stu-
dent, addressed from Lexington. |
had never before or since encountered
such a stream of obscenity and
scatology and plain-spoken, perhaps
boastful description of a young male’s
sexual activities, and which resulted
in his getting himself into a serious
scrape. From this, however, the young
man extricated himself, boasting to
his friend the while of accomplish-
ments along this line. Since my book
is not Portney’s Complaint (also pub-
lished by Random House, Inc.), 1

 

could not use this material. The
youth subsequently became a_ lead-
ing citizen of his community, and
a member of the board of trustees
of a college.

Another research jaunt took me to
the Cyrus Hall McCormick Historical
Association Library, a private library
maintained by the heirs of the in-
ventor of the Reaper, Cyrus H. Me-
Cormick, a native of Rockbridge
County, and friend and admirer of
General Lee’s.

Before moving on to other topics,
I wish to remark upon the rather
unsatisfactory condition of manu-
scripts generally at Washington and
Lee when I began my work shortly
after World War Il. The situation has
been improved considerably — since
then, although it is my impression
today that we much need a trained
archivist to take care of the price-
less manscripts in our possession. My
suggestion is that in addition to ade-
quate personnel for this purpose, we
make available a listing and descrip-
tion, if not an indexing, of the manu-
scripts at Washington and Lee.

The concluding meeting of the
Washington and Lee Free Forum will

The Economics Forum is increas-

standpoint on the much debated ad-
vertising problem. Dr. Charles Phil-

Mr. John Jennings, Department of
Journalism will lead the discussion.
Cigarette commercials will serve as
the primary example. The cigarette
advertising industry is currently under
fire from both the Federal communi-
cations Commission and Congress

Another important source of in-
formation about the history of Wash-
ington and Lee is the newspaper,
Fortunately, we have almost complete
files of Lexington newspapers avail-
able, some now on microfilm, from
the 1790's, In this connection, |
journeyed to the American Antiquar-

ian Society at Worcester, Massa-
chusetts, where I found Staunton
newspapers of the 1790's, and of

course to Richmond for the Williams-
burg Virginia Gazette and Richmond
newspapers, But the most complete
sources came from the old Lexington
Union, the old Lexington Gazette,
the Rockbridge County News (since
the early 1880's), and served ephem-
eral newspapers whose lives were
short.

Enough of sources for the present.
A historian must file and organize
his notes, and this I did after re-
turning to full-time teaching, using
the summers often for writing and
occasionally for additional research,
for materials have a way of turning
up—also sometimes after a book has
gone to press. All this caused fre-
quent revisions, and getting the manu-
scripts typed up in preliminary form.

Some years ago President Cole
made contact with the commercial
publisher in New York, Random

House, Inc., and after my manuscript
had been trimmed down to manage-
able proportions with the aid of Mr.
M. M. Kreeger of Tulane, it was
sent for a reading to Mr. Albert
Erskine, Vice President and Executive
Editor of Random House. Mr, Erskine
kindly agreed to read the manuscript,
and reported favorably upon _ it,
whereupon after some further delays
caused by his trip to Europe, the
book finally, after its long journey,
went to the printer, with the result
you have before you. From the sum-
mer of “68 until last February, 1

“Our Lady” Creator
Relates His “Dream”

(Editor's Note: Wednesday after-
noon before the opening perform-
ance of the Troubadours’ Produc-
tion of Our Lady, Friday Ring-tum
Phi editorial page editor Lawrence
McConnell talked with one of the
co-authors of the play, Ray Royce.
A freshman from Haverford, Pa.,
Royce spoke of the origin of the
play and his experience in its pro-
duction with Jeb Brown, co-author
of the play.)

Ring-tum Phi: | guess the first ques-
tion | should ask you, Ray, is how
did you get the idea for the play?
Ray Royce: Well, I've been writing a
long time—mostly poetry and stuff—
but I'd always wanted to write a
| play. | met Jeb this summer and got
| to know him fairly well. Then this
| October | guess was the first time We
/Feally talked about writing a play.

We both had the idea that we
wanted to write a play about a girl
; im one of Donovan's songs, “Geral-
dine.” | started out by writing about
my girl—not my girl really—but the
image. That's what we wanted to
create: the ideal woman. | guess
you might say this is a dream play
with song. poetry and dialogue: sort
of a mixture of surrealism and real-
ism. | guess it’s pretty idealistic, but
we tried to put everything into it,
through the poetry that I wrote and
the dialogue that Jeb did.

R-t Phi: How did you go about it?
It must have been had to write it
when you were working with another
person

Royce: Not really. We started out
by drawing up a plan of what we
wanted and | wrote the poetry

dialogue. Then we went back
it after we had finished.

I guess you'd say it was pretty much
a combined effort.

R-t Phi: How long have you been
mterested in drama? Did you
much in high school?

Royce: Oh yeah, all the way through
high school | was interested in it.
I guess | want to be a poet or a
playwright. I'm pretty sure hat Jeb
wants to continue his acting.

R-t Phi: Did you encounter any
trouble in producing it on the Troub
stage? I guess you were pretty limit-
ed by space.

Royce: (Laughier.) Yeah, you could
say that. The main problem was that
Jeb was acting and directing at the
sume time. We both knew what we
wanted, though. We also had a little
trouble finding a leading lady who
could play the part. Finally, we de-
cided on Happy Anderson; | guess
because she had more life at read-
ings than any of the others.

The part must be tough on her
because we have in mind exactly what
we want, and we almost had to mold
the character for her.

| wish that we could have done
more with the lights, too. But then
again, maybe we have put too much
mo it anyway—we tried to make
everything in the play mean some-
thing.

R+t Phi: Do you and Jeb have any
other plans for the play after it is
put on here?

Royce: I'm really not sure what'll
happen to it, Maybe | can get it

Aldridge Named
Assistant Coach

and Lee today an-
nounced the appointment of Norris
r. Aldridge as instructor in physical
education and assistant football coach.

Aldridge is presently a teacher and
head football coach at Natural Bridge
High School, where he was a star
quarterback for three years under
Coach Graham (Buck) Leslie in 1958-
60. Leslie is now the W&L head
coach.

Aldridge’s appointment,
Aug. 1, was announced by Dr.
liam W. Pusey Il, Dean of
College.

As assistant football coach, Ald-
ridge will work primarily with de-
fensive backs. He is filling the vacancy
created when Leslie was elevated to
head coach following the death of
Coach Lee McLaughlin last August.

Football fortunes had waned con-
siderably at Natural Bridge before
Aldridge was named coach in 1966.
Only seven boys reported for his first
practice and the team suffered through
a 1-9 season that year. But in 1967
the team posted a respectable 4-6
record and enjoyed a winning 6-4
mark last fall.

At Natural Bridge, Aldridge
coached baseball and track.

After graduation from Natural
Bridge in 1961, Aldridge continued
his education at the University of
Richmond, where he lettered for three

Captains Decry Coverage

To the Editors of Both Editions
of the Ring-tum Phi:

As co-captains of the W&L base-
ball team, we finally feel compelled
to speak out publicly about the lack
of coverage of our sport by both
editions of the Ring-tum Phi. We feel
that it is the responsibility of the
school paper (a University sponsored
organization) to keep the student body
and faculty informed about other Uni-
versity sponsored organizations of
which the baseball team is most
certainly one.

For a variety of unrelated reasons
including experimentation with print-
ing techniques, fits of temper, and
just poor news gathering, coverage of
sporting events in particular has suf-
fered this year. On Tuesday, April
29, we defeated Lynchburg 11-0. No
mention of this victory was made in
the following Friday's paper. On
Friday, May 2, we split a double-
header with Bridgewater losing the
first game 2-1, but rebounding to take
the second 13-5. The Tuesday edition
of May 6 carried no sports at all
prefering to run a full page ad that
was 80% blank space on what is
usually the sports page.

When the season began, we asked
the staffs of both editions for their
full co-operation and made schedules
and player information available to
them. We were promised assistance
in trying to increase student and fac-
ulty interest in attending our games.
Very little of this help has been forth-
coming. This is most disappointing in
that we feel that we have done our
part to bring recognition to Washing-
ton and Lee this season. The nine
victories we have amassed to date
represent the most wins by a W&L
baseball team since 1952. This fact
plus our overall improvement in the
last two years has prompted the daily
papers in Roanoke, Richmond, and
Lynchburg to ask that we send them
the results of every game. Television
stations in Richmond and Roanoke
have made similar requests, This
demonstrated interest of neighboring
mass media makes us wonder why
the Ring-tum Phi, our school paper,
considers us to be so unimportant.

CAC Opens Today At Centre
Four Sports Compete For Bells

Washington and Lee athletes will
wind up their seasons in four spring
sports today and tomorrow in pursuit
of the College Athletic Conference
championships at Centre College in
Danville, Ky.

The Generals currently are tied
for second in the overall CAC point
standings for the President’s Trophy,
symbolic of the league championship.
Southwestern of Memphis, champion
in basketball and co-winner with
Centre in football, has a command-
ing 20-point lead and is a strong
favorite to win the title.

Southwestern has 672 points to
471% for both Washington and Lee
and Centre. Washington University of
St. Louis is still in the running with
40 points, while last-place Sewanee
(22%) would need a miracle in the
four sports (baseball, track, golf and
tennis) to win the chamionship.

Champions in each sport are award-
ed 25 points, the runners-up 20, third
15, fourth 10 and fifth 5.

Washington and Lee is the de-
fending overall champion. Southwest-
ern has won one title, while Wash-
ington University captured the first
four crowns after the league was
formed in 1962.

The Generals appear strong in base-
ball and tennis and will be contend-
ers in golf. But they will be hard-
pressed in track, where they are
strong in field events but weak in
running events.

WAL boasts three conference track
champions in Mike Neer (high jump),
Mike Carrere (javelin) and Bill Kahn
(long jump). Neer set the CAC record
last year with a jump of 6-6% and
has cleared 6-8 in numerous meets
this year. Carrere threw the javelin a
record 181 feet last year as a fresh-
man and Kahn won the long jump
at 22 feet, 34-inch.

The Generals also will be strong
in the discus, where Doug Deaton has
broken his own school record three
times this year, the latest a toss of
146 feet, six inches,

 

W&L’s tennis squad has won the
CAC title for the past two years,
The General netmen will be led by
returning conference singles champ-
ions Don McClure and Bill Gatlin,
and doubles winners Tommy Rueger,
Tom McJunkin and McClure. Rueger
is no. 1 and the team captain.

The Generals netters own only a
6-5 record to date, but against much
tougher competition than previously.
Three of the other four teams all
boast winning records, led by South-
western’s 13-4 and Washington 11-5.
Sewanee, runner-up to W&L last
year, is 7-5,

WA&L’s baseball team has been a
pleasant surprise this spring and
boasts a 9-7 record. Top pitcher and
slugger Tim Mitchell, injured most
of the season, is now fully recovered.
He and fellow co-captain Jim Wilson
both made the all-CAC team last
year.

Mitchell has a 3-1 won-lost record
with a fine earned run average of
1.62. He’s also hitting .272 at the
plate. Gil Fitzhugh has posted a 4-3
pitching record with a 1.91 ERA, in
addition to being the top slugger at
327.

Wilson is batting .298 and Scotty
McChrystal is hitting .295 with 19
runs batted in and three home runs.

Golf coach Cy Twombly’s chat ges
are assured of a winning season with
a current 5-3 mark. The Generals,

 

runners-up to Sewanee last year, are)

paced by no. 1 Ken Carter, a sopho-
more, and Bob Mathews, who fired
a 70 in his last outing.

Stickmen Lose To Towson 8-6;
Face Tough Duke Team Here

In its game last Saturday, the La-
crosse team went down at the hands
of a tough Towson State College
team. This was a division game for

the Generals, and Coach Szlasa prais-
ed his team saying they played better
than they had at any time this season.
The final score was 8-6.

WAL had a strong opening in the
game, with the half time score being
5-3 in our favor. The Generals were
ahead until ten minutes were left in
the game. It was then that Towson’s
ace attackman, Tim Mahoney, broke
loose. His total output for the day
was three goals and three assists.

Coach Dick Szlasa had praise for
his tripartie defense of Ned Coslett,
Tommy Smith and Bill Brumback. He
gives them the credit to holding down
Towson’s potent attack in the first
three quarters. Szlasa also feels that
goalie Bill Ingersoll is improving with
each game and that as he improves,
so will the team. He said that the
defense and the goalie have jelled into
a fairly cohesive unit.

The midfields also drew praise from
Szlasa. The first midfield of Whit
Morrill, Bart Goodwin, and Jay
Meriwether played well as usual. The
second midfield of Clark Carter, John
Thomas, and Todd Morrill played its | ®
best game of the season according to
Szlasa. The midfields did most of the
scoring.

The attack was disappointing due to
its inability to penetrate the Towson
defense. Scott Neese was able to
score but the penetration by the at-

|tack ended there.

The early line on the Spring Sports |
Festival at Centre has it that South-|
western’s big lead will be too much |

to overcome.

CIRCLE K

The loss to Towson makes our
record 1-6. Coach Szlasa feels that
there are some boys on the team who
deserve post-season recognition, and

‘hopes that this record will not keep

Tradition-minded Washington and
Lee University hopes history repeats
itself when the Generals meet Duke
University in lacrosse here Saturday.

For the Blue Devils have won only
once since 1962 in their annual meet-
ing with W&L.

Based on records and recent per-
fomances, however, the visiting Duke
stickmen will be favored. The Blue
Devils own a 5-4 record, including
a win over a tough Air Force team,
while W&L has had its troubles in
a 1-6 season.

W&L does have creditable offense,
led by freshman attackman Scott
Neese and midfielde Jay Meriwether.
But the Generals are weak on de-
fense.

Duke will counter on offense with
All-America Steve Sachs at attack and
Chuck Clark at midfield. The Blue
Devil co-captains lead an offense
which is averaging nine goals a game.

Passavant to sit with
Trustee Board Friday

Student Body President Jay Passa-
vant presented his outline of sug-
gestions for the upcoming Board of
Trustees meeting in last night’s Ex-
ecutive meeting. A proposal to form
a new student body committee to
deal with the new Student Union and
a motion to withdraw W&L from the
Virginia Student Government Associa-
tion were also discussed,

will be the non-voting
student body representative to the
Board of Trustees when they meet
Friday in Roanoke. The EC approved
his proposed comments to the Board
—which call for increased University
attention to the dormitory needs of
the students. Passavant will cite the
need for new dorms if co-education
is approved and will also point out
their advantages in the event that
W&L remains a men’s school, He
will point out that it is the EC’s
feeling that new dorms should have
equal priority with a new gym and
a new library.

Passavant

Passavant also plans to discuss the
advantages of co-education, the EC's
current disposition toward the Honor
System, the possibility of establish-
ing a separate Honor Court for the
Law School, and the necessity of im-
proving the University’s stature
through public relations. He further
plans to discuss the University’s ad-
missions policy general with par-
ticular emphasis on the need for
greater student and alumni participa-

tion and the recruitment of black
students.
The EC had intended to interview

applicants for the positions of co-
chairmen of the Mock Convention,
but none of the applicants showed
up. Anyone still wishing to apply for
one of the two positions should con-
tact Judson Simmons at the KA house
sometime this week.

In a talk with Mayor Brady last
week, Passavant was told that the
proposals for the institution of a
property tax on cars and the requir-
ing of town tags will probably not
come up at this Thursday's meeting
as had been planned. Mayor Brady
assured Passavant that in the event
the proposals were not considered
this week, they would not come up
again until the students return in
the fall. Nevertheless, the EC will
still send Freshman Law Representa-
tive Phil Thompson to speak for the
students at the Council meeting in
case the proposals do come up.

The possibility of a new student
committee to Oversee the operations
of the Student Union was considered.
Currently, the Assimilation Commitee
is responsible for the organization of
the Union. One suggestion was that
the Assimilation Committee be re-
dircted premanently along those lines
Another suggestion advocated the
formation of a completely new eight-|
man committee for the job. Discus- |

As Dr. Crenshaw noted in his speech last Friday
some of the most valuable materials to him in this
project were old Virginia newspapers. In particular, he
mentioned the Williamsburg Virginia Gazetic. the old
Lexington Union, the old Lexington Gazette, and sinc
the 1880's the Rockbridge County News. Even research

until next year.

The EC also discussed enforcing
a two dollar student assessment for
the purpose of financing the 1970
Contact. After discussing the wisdom
of the EC’s backing an IFC opera-
tion, it was decided that the chairman
should be interviewed next week to
discover the needs of the program.
The EC has raised funds for the
symposium for the last two years,

At the close of the meeting, Senior-
Intermediate Law Representative Pete
Hendricks moved that the EC with-
draw W&L from the VASG. He
pointed out that the University had
joined the group last year, not be-
cause of its central organization, but
because the VASG's peripheral com-
mittees would be beneficial to W&L
students. At that time there was a
student travel committee being organ-
ized which planned to offer students
reduced fares on flights to Europe.
Nothing has developed of the com-
mittee since December. Hendricks
stated that the other committees of
the VASG were also undeveloped.
Due to his fear that the VASG may
become the political organ of some
gubernatorial candidate, and because
the University has little to gain from
membership in his eyes, he requested
complete withdrawal. The motion will
be discussed further and voted upon
next week.

ames article published
by prestigious journal

International recognition in the art
world was recently received by Dr.
Gerald M. Doyon, Associate Profes
sor of Fine Arts. The Gazette Des
Beaux-Arts, Paris, the oldest and
most prestigious journal in the world
for art history, featured in its Janu-
ary issue an article by Dr. Doyon.

The article, which appeared in the
journal in five languages, concerned
“The Positions of the Panels Decorat
ed by Theodore Chasseriau at the
Former Cour des Comptes in Paris.”

Chasseriau began the operation in
1844, and the finished product repre-
sented four years of arduous labor.
It was the largest mural commission

ever granted to a French artist. Un-
fortunately for art lovers, little of
the original mural still remains. The

building within which the mural was
housed was destroyed by fire in 1871.

Dr. Doyon’s task was
since the mural originally covered
three-thousand square feet and was
populated with over two hundred and
thirty figures. Doyon, whose research
was financed under a grant to France
in 1964, concentrated his efforts to-
word a reconstruction of the ensemble
through forgotten building plans and
through newspaper articles contemp-
orary with tie murals.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion Of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s T'wice-Weekly Newspaper
Tuesday, May 13, 1969

Transition, installment number70

Beginning right now, Bob Yevich assumes the editorship
of this edition of The Ring-tum Phi, and it is with confidence
and warmest wishes for success that we turn the proprietorship
over to him. Although responsibility remains with the 1968-
1969 editor until June, we yield to tradition; The Ring-tum

Phi is his.

Editors often being reluctant to give up such a post, this
Editor will continue to use the editorial columns, as will the
Editor-Elect, but we leave the rest of the paper (including
all the work) in very capable hands.

 

The Ring-tum Phi Awards

Tomorrow evening at the Senior Banquet the third annual
presentation of The Ring-tum Phi Awards will take place.
These Awards, which will be made to four outstanding gentle-
men, are intended to complement—not compete with—other
forms of recognition for outstanding service to the University.
Particular attention is paid to those who have excelled in some
area, and to those who might otherwise not be honored. The
Awards are sponsored by The Publications Board, and the
recipients are chosen by the Tuesday and Friday editions.

With the Awards go our gratitude and thanks and that
of the entire University community.

 

Regrets; and apologies to
Tom Mitchell and Jim Wilson

Below is reprinted a letter delivered to both editions of
the paper; it appeared last Friday, but we would like to reprint
it—because it deserves acknowledgement, and beacuse we

would like to comment on it:

As co-captains of the W&L base-
ball team, we finally feel compelled
to speak out publicly about the lack
of coverage of our sport by both
editions of the Ring-tum Phi. We feel
that it is the responsibility of the
school paper (a University sponsored
organization) to keep the student body
and faculty informed about other Uni-
versity sponsored organizations of
which the baseball team is most
certainly one.

For a variety of unrelated reasons
including experimentation with print-
ing techniques, fits of temper, and
just poor news gathering, coverage of
sporting events in particular has suf-
fered this year. On Tuesday, April
29, we defeated Lynchburg 11-0. No
mention of this victory was made in
the following Friday's paper. On
Friday, May 2, we split a double-
header with Bridgewater losing the
first game 2-1, but rebounding to take
the second 13-5, The Tuesday edition
of May 6 carried no sports at all
prefering to run a full page ad that

Thom Mitchell

was 80% blank space on what is
usually the sports page.

When the season began, we asked
the staffs of both editions for their
full co-operation and made schedules
and player information available to
them. We were promised assistance
in trying to increase student and fac-
ulty interest in attending our games.
Very little of this help has been forth-
coming. This is most disappointing in
that we feel that we have done our
part to bring recognition to Washing-
ton and Lee this season. The nine
victories we have amassed to date
represent the most wins by a W&L
baseball team since 1952. This fact
plus our overall improvement in the
last two years has prompted the daily
papers in Roanoke, Richmond, and
Lynchburg to ask that we send them
the results of every game. Television
stations in Richmond and Roanoke
have made similar requests. This
demonstrated interest of neighboring
mass media makes us wonder why
the Ring-tum Phi, our school paper,
considers us to be so unimportant.

Jim Wilson

1969 Baseball Co-Captains

To Messrs. Mitchell and Wilson and to the Baseball Team
we extend our sincerest apologies. Excuses? Yes, we have some,
but instead of giving them—which will make it seem as though
we are trying to pass the buck, and we're definitely not—we
will speak for this edition and for the Friday edition as well,

in saying we're sorry.

The editorship of The Ring-tum Phi has not been charact-
erized as a vehicle which makes friends for the Editor (how
true!), but we do not wish to add these gentlemen to our
list of non-admirers. Although it is a little late, we will do our
best to correct an error that should not have been.

 

We agree; and furthermore —*

Last Friday’s edition carried an editorial calling for the
refurbishing, if not the revamping, of the dormitories, especi-
ally with regard to the recent rulings by the faculty permitting
girls to visit men in dormitory rooms.

We heartily add our voice to the sentiments of Mr. Kessler,
perhaps the fact that non-students will become as familiar
with the rooms as we students have—and will likely feel as
we do about them—will prompt some funds to be allocated
for this purpose during the summer. The suggestions Mr.
Kessler made certainly could not be prohibitively expensive.

But we cannot resist the opportunity to put in an even
stronger and more deeply felt word in favor of erecting dormi-
tories, and not just for freshmen but for everyone. This is
not the first time we've suggested this, and hopefully more

support will grow for this long-standing need, a need which |
deserves placement in a higher echelon of priorities than it)

seems to be in now.

Letters
To the Editor

Walker scores
uncooperative Co-op

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

Tonight, once again, | was forced
to notice the service given patrons
of the snack bar at the Co-op. This
evening, thirteen students stood by
waiting while one man helped us,
he in no great haste. After being
served I noticed the other three
gentlemen who are employed by the
University to operate this service in
a room behind the bar playing cards.
This is not the first time I have
noticed this type of laxness.

I feel, and I am sure I express the
feelings of many of the students who
patronize the Co-op, that this incom-
petence should not be allowed to
continue. Action should be taken to
relieve this situation, for it is cer-
tainly avoidable and certainly unde-
sirable.

Barbs and Bristles ...

The fools about the hill...

By JEFFREY WEXLER
Columnist

UPTIGHT. THATS HH. UP-
TIGHT. No one blow your cool.
We all Paxton Quigley, man. Re-
member him? He was the fourth in
the attic.

To quote a Dance Board mem-
ber, “He'd be on the Dance Board.
He’s a stud.” Yessir, Paxton Quigleys.
That’s our image—in Playboy and
Esquire for example, and in the dark
night of each and every one of our
souls that’s what we try to be.

“Hold it,” some low-keyed, Gant-
clad, Weejun taped, sockless aspirant
to social valhalla cries. “Hold it,” he
drawls without once letting the merest
hint of saliva dribble down his peach-
fuzzed chin. “What's wrong,” says he,
“with having scored fifty times be-
fore you're a sophomore and not
have acne?”

“Nothing” says I (not owning Wee-
juns or Gant or peach-fuzz). “But,”
I add, with certain self-righteousness,
“it's not everything except for one

thing: This raising of apathy and
‘moves’ to high virtue at expense of
any involvement damns you, and
opens a mortal wound in our aca-
demic society.” (“‘Tis not as wide
as a church door, nor as deep as
a well, but ‘twill do,’ ‘twill do.”)

In a classless age where money
makes the man and men make only
money, there is no such thing as
the gentleman C. Adequacy is in-
adequate. The qualities of a gentle-
man are to be praised—but only as
a means to an ends, Your laurels for
coolness under fire, Paxton Q., are
good only for one thing: Pickling.

But you boys who would grow up
to coolness, you limit your sphere of
action for fear of the uncool. You
limit your individuality for fear of
perverting totally the recipe for stud.
The most involuntary actions become
considered in terms of image. In
short, you become a tin phoney. Up-
tight you are and you take your-
selves too seriously. How much is

 

a pedigree worth?

 

A coming crisis in the Greek system?

DAVID HIGGINS
Columnist

There will always be the need for
something like the fraternity system
in a social environment. Despite the
self-sufficient implications of tech-
nology, man is still a social animal
and as such strives for the recogni-
tion of the group. Fraternities offer
this group-recognition and perhaps
more; but there will be in the future
on this campus a severe crisis for the
Greek system.

The problem will arise because of
two external forces which will occur
simultaneously, the one weakening
the fraternity appeal, the other over-
shadowing the system in its weak-
ened state. Fraternities are rapidly
outliving their own traditions. They
are finding even within their own
ranks that their mystical aura is be-
coming non-existent and that their
idealistic goals are highly suspect.
These selling points of the past are
becoming unimpressive and conse-
quently inefficient. The real selling
point, group-recognition, is still there,
but in a highly pressured society, men
are inclined to feel that they are alone
and must make it on their own, The
recognition of a group which is non-
academic and non-economic is fore-
ed to look superfluous.

This stripping away of a tradition
will reduce the fraternity to a state
analogous to that of a business. The
market products will become room,
board, and party facilities, but there
will be a monopoly arising in the
market which will overshadow the
business-like fraternity. The school
being the larger, more efficient pro-
ducer of these market products will
be the most prosperous and success-
ful in winning the students’ patronage.
Without intentionally going into com-
petition with the fraternity system, the
school will inadvertently cause the
collapse of the fraternity.

The tragedy will not be that the
fraternity system is gone, but that
the overshadowing force will find it
has unconsciously destroyed a very
human institution. In true pendulum
fashion, the old traditions of the fra-
ternity will cease to be questioned.
and as the giant educational complex
becomes more and more efficient at
offering its products to an ever grow-
ing monopolized market, imperson-
alization will result, The instinet for
group-recognition will be acutely felt
now that the highly pressurized so-
ciety has become too efficient and
too concerned with offering these
products so appealing during the ques-
tioning period which destroyed a tra-
dition. Something like the fraternity

By

system will be created by the educa-
tional complex, but a rational insti-
tute will have to deny mysticism and
idealism, aspects which made fra-
ternity recognition so valid in the
past.

Perhaps the academy will find the
answer to the dissatisfaction outside
of fraternity-like institutions, but more
importantly perhaps, the giant should

have been more concerned with what
happened to the “irrelevant and un-
democratic” aspect of its former
existence. In the process of efficiency
the leading force should not neglect
the inefficient and non-academic side
of the social animal. It trends are
really cyclical, there will again be a
role for the fraternity system in the
social environment.

 

Green hills of Virginia

By PAPA

When you have spent some time
shooting in the wetlands of the Isla
de Pinas off the Cuban coast or in
the fields outside Madrid, and when
you have tried your hand at most any
other sport, you will certainly agree,
my friend, that the game of the bull
is most fascinating, and that reeling
in a big hooker with line alone, no
rod, is one of the most satisfying
experiences you will ever know.

It was in the high country of Vir-
ginia that this happened. We were
following the line of the bull that
Spring from one pueblecito to
another. In the evening there were
many fiestas in the apartamientos and
tabernas in the village. In the country
the campesinos celebrated the time
with their sheep.

But this is a sporting story, so I
shall tell you of our adventures. My
driver, tiny man with a quick tongue
and a Bourbon y Parma nose was
named Marty Cohn, a name strange
to this rugged land between Alta-
vista and Buena Vista. He knew of
me not as a writer which I some-
times am, but as an aficionado for
my reputation as a lover of the bull
had proceeded me. Day and night
Marty Cohn swaggered about in a
pair of old rubber fishing boots. He
queried me about what I fished for
once as we sat in the shade of a
redneck in front of the laundro-
materia,

| told him and he was disappoint-
ed. He was not a man for such
types of big game. But he rose this
little hook-nosed Marty Cohn driver
and said he would take me to a clean,
well-lighted place where there would
be much game but after many hours
we stopped only at a Briar Patch.

Marty Cohn said that this was
not his estilo and he would wait in
the war surplus jeep he drove with
the image of Franco on the dash-
board. “Papa,” he said, “tenga cui-
dado.” | looked into his wall-eyes
and suid “No comprendo.” I did not
understand.

 

It was late and every one of the

hookers had left the patch for other
grounds except for a female who sat
in the shadow of the thorns of the
briars made against my electric light.
I checked my weapon, a single bar-
relled knucherupfer.

In the game of the bull, you will
find that it is the old female ones
who are the hardest to land with a
line alone. This is not a sport for
matadors who are more for the boars.

But as I sat I felt to myself 1
had a hooker. Placing a beer on the
table, I let her have bait. She took
it. | let her have line. She took it.
I let her have play. She took it. You
must understand that when you have
a cold cerveza Ballantine or a malta
Hatvey and you are fishing for a
trophy, you must take care with every
move. You must be cool.

“Papa,” to myself I said, “be cool.”
I am an old man and the sea is a
woman. In Spanish, they hear los-
gringos turistos say “No haga las
olas.” Don't make waves.

But I started to reel her in too
quick. I jerked. She snapped back.
And while she continued to take line,
I knew, my friend, that she was no
hooker, no easy mark. I knew as
even Hefner who was once very good
with lines that [| had lost this game
of bull.

On the way back to our camp some
miles near the Natural Bridge, Marty
Cohn looked at me and said, “You
must not be sad, papa, man is not
made for defeat. Man can be de-
stroyed but not defeated.”

We moved on the next morning
at dawn to chase the camp-followers
on the streets of the little towns.

Library hours
during exams

 

Garland Tucker, chairman of the
Student Library Committee, announc-
ed that beginning on May 19 the
library will be open until 3 a.m, in
the morning to facilitate exam study-
ing. The extension of library hours
during exam week was begun last
semester. Mr. Leach, the head li
brarian, noted that attendance at the
library was high until 2 a.m. after
which there seemed to be hardly
enough people studying there to keep
it open. Mr, Leach said, that after
consultation with the Student Library
Committee, it would be again kept
open until 3 am. but if the at-
tendance was again low between 2
am, and 3 am, it would only be
kept open until 2 a.m. in the future

Mr. Leach also announced a stiffer
policy toward returning books at the
end of the year. All books are due
by June §. Those books not returned
iby June 9 will be subject to a $3
lservice fine: if the books are lost
they will have to be paid for by
the loser. There will be a box in
front of the library from June § to
June 9 to facilitate those who wish to
return their books while the library
is closed

Is it worth the great gobs of
silvercoins and dollar bills paid for
campaign posters? The down-the-road
gas money. The churning feeling of
not dressing right or of being called
a (excuse the language) flamer? Of
course, it’s worth it. You believe
being a stud lasts. Since there are
no responsibilities for doing, there is
no lasting recognition in this world
if you're a stud (or is there a Hall
of Fame for Breeders, Cherry-Pickers,
Bare-back Riders, and Caretakers?).
“As all life is passion and action, man
must be a part of the action and
passion of his time upon pain of be-
ing judged not to have lived at all.”
No stud Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote
that. Maybe he’s wrong. We all re-
member Don Juan—translated into
Don Giovanni—who went to Hell.
Or, as Dante said, “The hottest place
in Hell is reserved for those who in
times of moral crisis have reserved
their commitment.” In this time a
stud cannot afford involvement or
commitment; he must be agile, not
fumble; he must leave all exits open.
“Here I stand and it is not safe to
move,” he cries,

I dare suggest we have past the
Reformation and in this time a
normal, unstudly man affraid less of
temporal flames than eternal fire
knows that it is not safe to stay put.

Little men in grey flannel levis
with little grip-fisted stomachs out in
the rain, afraid to go inside, but
afraid too to enjoy the downpour.
We take ourselves to seriously. We
want to grow up too fast. So we
lose perspective. We cease to treat
things as they are but use the concept
of microcosm. The institutions of
Washington and Lee cease to be part
of the world but instead become
parallels to it. We are no longer a
part of the mountain but a_ hillock
unto ourselves, Thus the concept of
microcosm.

And once you have made your
stand here, there are no more stands
to make. Once your success is ac-
knowledged here, you are a success
for all time. Remember Irwin Shaw's
“The Eighty Yard Run”? That's it.
So you push and you shove out of
perspective, concerning yourself not
with your own appreciation of these
shortest, gladdest years, but with
others’ appreciation of your place in
it. Damn the opposition. (Or, as the
Hon. Whipple says, “Let them eat
glass.”) Dare to be eccentric. Letting
go is so fine. Grow mature but don’t
grow up.

Do your own thing. Be eccentric
enough to establish values for your-
self and, for God's (and your own)
sake don't be duped into the simple
expedient of accepting the crutch of
“studliness” from one of the fair-
haired sun-tanned damned Lotharios
and image worshipers of WAL. Over-
use of crutches leads to atrophy of
limbs... all limbs.

Washington and Lee’s representa-
tives at the spring CAC tournament
overcame a 20 point deficit to win
the CAC bell for the overall con-
ference championship. It was the
second straight year that the Gen-
erals had earned such an_ honor.
Leading the way was the tennis
team which gained its third straight
conference title under the leadership
of Coach Verne Canfield. W&L’s track
men took the second spot in con-
ference competition and the base-
ball team and golfers each placed
third.

The tennis team entered the tourney
with a 6-5 record against tough major
college competition. In Friday’s
matches the Generals placed four
singles and three doubles teams in
the finals. But it was on Saturday
that the finals and the ultimate test
came. Tommy Rueger (no. 1) won
his matches 4-6, 6-2 and 6-2. Bill
Gatlin (no. 3) won by the scores
5-7, 6-1, 6-3. And Rick Armstrong
(no. 5) beat his opponent 1-6, 6-3,
6-4. John Kefauver also placed in
the sixth place slot.

Rain almost ended the finals in
doubles, but after some heated dis-
putes W&L’s doubles teams assured
a first place berth to the Generals.
Coach Canfield attributed the all im-
portant first place win to the doubles
teams of Rueger-Gatlin, Armstrong-
Driscoll, and MecClure-McJunkin,
who were out playing until 8:00
Saturday evening.

A second place finish came to
;Coach Walden’s tracksters. Friday
|saw the Generals capture first place
in two out of four events. Mike
Neer won the high jump with a
leap of 6-6, within %4 of an inch
of his own conference record, W&L
also took the javelin event with a
clean sweep of first, second, and third
places. Mike Carrere won with a toss
of 171-7 and behind him were Charlie

Freret and Neer.
Saturday brought two more vic-
tories for Washington and Lee. A

time of 54.3 was good enough for
Sam Hinkle to take the 440. Strong-
man Doug Deaton jumped to the lead
in the discus by flinging for a distance
of 138-7. Washington College of St.
Louis, however used its strength in
the running events to edge out W&L
for the conference _championship.

Dana Foundation
Announces Gift

Washington and Lee has received
a grant of $250,000 from the
Charles A. Dana Foundation of
Greenwich, Conn. to help provide the
university with new facilities for its
School of Commerce and Admini-
stration, President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley announced today.

One of two major undergraduate
divisions at Washington and Lee, the
School of Commerce and Administra-
tion has been identified by President
Huntley as among four areas of ma-
jor need in the institution's physical
facilities.

Other high priority projects under
study at Washington and Lee include
a $2,2000,000 addition to Doremus
Gymnasium, new facilities for the
School of Law, and a new central
library.

President Huntley said the Dana
gift in support of the School of Com-
merce and Administraion is “especi-
ally gratifying and timely.”

“This grant of a quarter of a mil-
lion dollars will give impetus to our
planning, and it will help focus at-
tention on the School's requirements
among alumni and other friends on
whom we are depending for fianancial
assistane,” President Huntley said.

He said the Dana grant is a “sub-

| stantial fraction” of the total funds

that will be sought to provied new

| facilities for the School of Com-

Pabsavank Lee Win F. J. Gilliam Prize

Because of his leadership in a
variety of changes in student life dur-
ing 1968-69, the student body presi-
dent of Washington and Lee was a
co-recipient this week of two an-
nual student service awards,

Jay Passavant, a senior chemistry
major from Beaver, Pa., was awarded
both the coveted Gilliam Award and

one of the special citations presented | W&l
by the student newspaper, the Ring- |
tum Phi, for outstanding contributions |

to Washington and Lee.

The Gilliam Award also went to!

Randy Hale Lee, a senior law stu-
dent from Baltimore, who was cited
for a wide range of services to WAI

during his undergraduate and ad

studies here.
Established in 1963, the award is
named in honor of Dean Emeritus

Students Named
To Committees

The appointment of students to
serve on University committee study-
ing coeducation and the future size
of undergraduate enrollment was an-
nounced today by President Robert
E. R. Huntley,

Named to the study committee on
the question of coeducation at W&I
were William Michael Gottwald of
Richmond, Va., and Steven Bruce
Sandler of Norfolk, Va. The com-
mittee also includes seven faculty and
adminstration members, and Dr
Louis W. Hodges, professor of re
ligion, serves as chairman.

Appointed to the committee on size
were Dan Madison Leonard of Ros-
well, New Mexico, and Charles As-
bury Holt Jr. of Blacksburg, Va.

Also on the size committee are
nine faculty members. John M. Gunn,
associate professor of economics,
serves as chairman.

Both committees are to study in
formation that will be useful in de
cision making, according to President
Huntley. It is hoped that reports will

| be completed by the end of the cur

rent calendar year. The size com
mittee will study whether WA&l
should be smaller, larger, or the same
as current enrollment.

All four student committee mem
bers are rising seniors

Use Existing Set-Up

The Executive Committee is considering doing a very good
thing. We would like to urge them to do it.

Facing the perennial problem of what to do with the
Assimilation Committee, the EC has given it temporary juris-
diction over the Student Union. It is considering making this
arrangement permanent. It should.

The alternative is to create another committee solely for
the purpose of handling the Student Union once it opens. This
would not be objectionable if the Assimilation Committee
really had anything else to do. Its activities have in recent years
been confined to the management—or mismanagement—of
Freshman Camp and Organization Week. Because both these

events are over in September,

the considerable talent which

exists on the Assimilation Committee has been allowed to
atrophy the rest of the year. We feel it can be put to better

use.

To create another committee would be to increase un-
necessarily the organizational responsibilities of the EC while
maintaining in the student government bureaucracy a com-
mittee which is meaningless eight months of the school year.
The talent for the job is already available in the present set-up.

It needs to be put to use.

—R.L.E

 

A Word On Coverage

Although the Tuesday edition certainly spoke for us in
apologizing to the baseball team for the poor coverage it has
received in both Ring-tum Phis this year, we feel impelled to
express our own embarrassment.

We have no real defense for the charges; they are true,
and we are sincerely sorry. If, as might be claimed, “cir-
cumstances beyond our control” often preclude adequate re-
porting of many events important to W&L, we can pledge
only to try and control more of those circumstances next

year.

The althletic teams especially have always deserved more
journalistic attention than they have received, and we thank
Messrs. Mitchell and Wilson for calling attention to our short-

comings.

This brings us to our main point. Once again the staffs
are changing, and, while no staff can satisfy everyone in news
coverage, we eagerly solicit constructive criticism. If it seems
we are ignoring a group at W&L, a reminder will be appreci-

ated, and, we hope, sufficient.

For Next Year’s Dance Board

(Below is an interview with Dean
Kumpuris, President of the Dance
Board, obtained for the purpose of
clarifying the policies of next year's
Board. We appreciate the time he
has given and hope that this will
help clear up any questions which
the student body may have con-
cerning the dance plans and weck-
ends).

The Friday Ring-tum Phi: In light
of the recent decision to sell tickets
to the students, what will be the policy
concerning the sale of dance plans
for next year?

Dean Kumpuris: Last year's price of
$40.00 will be continued, but will in-
clude a great deal more than it has

remain non-transferrable because of |

for the tickets to the individual con

these be offered?

Kumpuris: To answer your second)

question initially, there will be no
conditions or restrictions upon the
sale of tickets; these will be made
available to the student body and to
the public. The tickets will be ex-
pensive, costing $10.00 per evening
per couple; the price far from

planned for mext year's schedule?

Kumpuris: We anticipate now having
either seven or eight different events
This will include two weekends in
which there will be two nights of

Dean Adams admits to a bias for
electives and whenever a
has sought his advice on

which electives to take, “be sure to

The common complaint of employers
nationally is that young persons are
going into business who cannot write

“They need to be exact in

athletic talents and his attitude.

“He is one of the finest young men
I've ever coached” says Coach Verne
Canfield about Tom Rueger. He feels
he cannot say enough about the Nor-
folk, Va. senior in regard to his

Tom Rueger has been the number
one man on the tennis team for all
of his four years at W&L. This is
a first for any W&L player, and the
pressure that goes along with being
number one, which might seem to
make it a rather dubious honor, has
served as a challenge to Rueger.

Playing the likes of Duke, Mary-
land, and Virginia his 12-3 record

 

this season seems remarkable, except
for the fact that he has had a winning |
season every year. This is an ac-}|
complishment in itself.
Canfield says he is certainly one |
of the finest captains he has ever |
had, making a team sport out of what
is normally an individual sport. His |
off-the-court encouragement of the |
tennis team helped mold this year’s
team, which finished with an |
record and won its third straight CAC
i hampionship.
There is a spirit of mutual respect |
and enthusiasm between Canfield and |
Rueger. Tom feels that Coach Can- |
field was instrumental in bringing out |
the best in each individual player. |
| He also praises Canfield for his ability |
| to instill a winning spirit in the play- |
| ers,
| still a pleasure to play under him.
Tom feels for many reasons that
this season was the most satisfying

 

the team atmosphere, and the atten-
tion of Coach Canfield to the indi-
vidual players and to the team all
helped. Rueger’s record of 12- 3|
against the toughest competition he
has yet faced shows his satisfaction |
is well-founded.

tention to the team, saying, “He does
all he can under the circumstances.”

Tom feels the tennis program has
been more challenging each year he
has played. He cites the dropping of
schools like Roanoke, and their re-
placement with teams like Maryland
and Duke. But in spite of the tough-
ness of the schedule, Rueger says it

Mr. Lauck To Retire

(Continued from Page 2)

\fter working in print shops in
St. Louis, Lynchburg and Strasburg,
Va., Lauck learned that the position
at Washington and Lee was open.

“There were over 30 applicants, I
got the job because I was the only
one with a college degree.”

It wasn't long before Lauck made
a name for himself. The awards came
quickly and steadily: a medal for dis-
tinguished service to graphic art edu-
cation, first prize among 2,500
entrants in a typography contest,
election to the Royal Society of Arts
and Crafts of England.

“Inland Printer,” a leading trade
publication, featured him as one of
the nation’s best printers. He was
elected president of the International
Graphic Arts Education Associaion,
of which he was a charter member.

He constantly strove for excellence.
“| felt our work always had to be
the best because of the great men
associated with this University,” he
said,

“The print shop was not real
popular when I came here in 1932,”
Lauck recalled. “I sold the faculty
and department heads on using our
services by showing them we could
do top-quality work. Now everybody
on campus uses it.”

The WAL print shop today handles
most of the University’s publications,
including alumni magazine, two
literary magazines, the twice-a-week
student newspaper, and a multitude of
programs for such events as concerts,
lectures and sports events.

Volume has doubled since Lauck
took over. His original three-man staff
now numbers five.

LANE WILL
HEAD NEW
CENTER

1964 Graduate

LED CLASS, DANCE
BOARD AND PAPER

Washington and Lee will welcome
back one of its sons this fall when
Ken Lane, class of 1964, returns to
Lexington to direct the University’s
new Student Center. While the Center
will not be opened until September,
Mr. Lane will be on hand during
July and August to organize the activi-
ties of the Center and plan for the

year ahead,

Mr. Lane brings with him a famili-
arity with almost every campus
activity and organization at W&L
with which he will have to deal.
During his undergraduate years at
W&L he was extremely active in

many campus organizations and an
officer of several. He participated in
school politics and was an outstand-
ing student.

Mr. Lane, a native Richmonder, ts
a member of Phi Delta Theta social
fraternity at Washington and Lee. He
presided over the chapter as its Presi-
dent in his Senior year. Mr, Lane's
influence on campus spread far be-
yond his fraternity, however. He was
a prominent member of both the Stu-
dent Service Society an dithe Uni-
versity Christian Association, serving
as President of the former and Vice-
President of the latter in 1963-4,

A particular interest of Mr. Lane’s
was University social life. Through
his elective office as President of the
Senior class Mr. Lane was the Presi-
dent of Finals Dance in 1964, He
also earned a place on the Dance
Board on his own merit, however,
and was Vice-President of the Board
in his senior year.

Among his more notable honors at
W&L were his being tapped into
Omicron Delta Kappa national honor-
ary society, his election as class presi-
dent, and his tenure as Editor-in-Chief
of The Friday Ring-tum Phi in 1963-
64. He was also a Dean's List and
Honor Roll student.

Troubadours present ten
one-act plays through Wed,

Washington and Lee’s final drama-
tic offering of the year is now under
way at the Troubadour Theatre. Be-
ginning last night and continuing
through tomorrow night, there is a
presentation of ten one-act plays, all
under the direction of students.

The current performances are not

a Troubadour production as such.
They are the result of efforts by
W&L Drama Professor Lee Kahn's

directing class. While many of the
actors and directors are members of
the Troubadours, the directors are all
members of Mr. Kahn's class.

The directors were given complete
freedom to choose their plays. How-
ever, despite the wide range of
latitude this afforded, most of the
plays can be grouped under a general
theme of modern absurdist drama.
Only one of the plays is a completely
original effort, Dave Waelder’s “Two,”
the play he directed along with Jud-

|son Simmons

Following his graduation from |
Washington and Lee, Mr. Lane en-|
rolled in Union Theological Seminary |
in New York. He expects to receive |
his Bachelor of Divinity degree from |
that institution next month, |

The new Student Center Dircetor |
will have primary responsibility for |
the organization of the new Center. |
The current Assimilation Committee |
has been assigned to work with Mr. |
Lane in the initial stages of the|
Center's establishment, but it will)
eventually hand over all responsibility |
to him. He will manage the new)
tavern, as well as the various recrea-
tional facilities provided by the new
Center. It is possible that dances and
parties will be held in the new
Center.

It has been suggested in the EC
that the Assimilation Committee De |

Center.

In the remaining two nights of
the three night production seven plays
will be performed, Tonight's offering
will feature “3000 Red Ants,” the
“Ugly Duckling,” “Fancy Act I,” and
“Two.”

The first play, “3000 Red Ants,”
was written by Ferlinghetti and cen-
ters around an unusual setting. It
depicts a couple in bed, but they
mime their actions standing up with
two pillows suspended behind them as
if showing an overhead view. The
play attempts to show relatively
sterile people in a relatively sterile
environment,

The “Ugly Duckling” portrays a
King with an ugly daughter whom
he is trying to marry off. “Fancy Act
it” is an absurdist murder play. The
Waelder-Simmons entry, “Two,” deals
with the topic of boy-girl tension

Ihe Executive Committee met for
the last time this year Monday night,
but not without turning its attention
to several matters of importance. In
the last meeting to be presided over
by President Jay Passavant, the EC
voted to assess the student body two
dollars per person for next year’s
Contact symposium and to withdraw
Washington and Lee from the Vir-
ginia Student Governments Associa-
tion.

First item on the agenda was the
request of the Contact chairman,
Larry Honig, for a two dollar student
body assessment. It was pointed out
that last year’s student body was also
assessed for Contact. The chairman
presented his financial statement of
the past year’s expenses of the pro-
gram and his expectations of next
year’s budget. After his presentation
the committee decided to vote. The

motion to enforce a student assess-
ment passed unanimously with no
abstentions,

 

i the year. The evening will begin with
a William Butler Yeats play, “Purga-
tory,” which was not intended for
production originally. The second one-
act performance will be Leroi Jones’
“Dutchman.” It faces the problem of
the Negro forced to conform to mod-
ern society, but wanting to live in-
dependently. White violence under-
lies the repressed desire of the black
man to break the white hold. The
final offering of the night will be
“Crucifixation,” a miracle play.

Last night, the three day series got
off to a fine start with a presentation
of “Endgame,” a Samuel Beckett play
which is probably the most well
known of the ten. It was followed by
“Act Without Words,” a_ rather

Ihe Committee then turned its at-
|tention to a request by the W&L
| Rugby club for five hundred dollars
with which to meet its operating ex-
penses for the coming year, The EC
had appropriated three hundred dol-
lars to the club last year for new
uniforms. The additional two hundred
dollars this year was requested on
the expectation that the club will
expand its operations considerably in
the coming year. In the absence of
a financial report from the club, the
EC voted it one hundred dollar
appropriation to meet Summer operat-
ing expenses. The club will present a
detailed budget to the EC in the
fall if it requests further funds. It
was also suggested that the club ex-
plore other outlets for revenue such
as the administration and the athletic

department.
A motion was made to warn all
witnesses and accused in Honor

Trials, of their full rights under the
system at the time of their summons.

concluded with the performance of |

is a Satire On existence.

it all up

The 1969 Calyx should come out

to Business Manager Jeff Wexler. The

It was pointed out that in several
instances, students had been called to
the witness stand in Honor Trials on
nights before they faced tests. In these
cases, the witnesses are allowed to
take the test at a later date, but
some students this year have failed
examinations due to their ignorance
of their rights. The motion was dis-
allowed because such information on
rights is already supposed to be offer-
ed, but the Committee did pledge to
be more careful to warn witnesses of
their rights,

For the third week in a row, the
Committee was forced to postpone
interviews for the posts of co-chair-
man of the Mock Convention due to

Magnificent Men to preview new
album at W&L in Finals concert

By REED BYRUM

Rhythm and Blues has forever been
a secular mode of expression of Negro
groups and individuals, until the in-
ception of the Righteous Brothers
several years ago. However, the Right-
eous Brothers have since split up,
and their slack has been picked up
by one of the biggest college at-
tractions on the east coast, the Magni-
ficent Men,

The Mag Men hit it big with their
first album, “Peace of Mind” two
years ago and have remained on top
since then. Their second album, re-
corded at the Uptown Theatre in Phil-
adelphia, has already sold over 100,-
000 copies with many more sales an-
ticipated. They have established their
reputation as the best “blue-eyed
soul” group in the nation and have
had number one hits in Philadelphia,
Cleveland, D.C., Chicago, New York
and Motown.

WAL will be the scene of a pre-
view of their current album, “The
World of Soul,” plus their newest
single “Save the Country.” Capital
Records predicated that their album
would be one of the top-selling cuts
of the year, thus putting complete
confidence in the Mag Men.

The group was supposed to appear
at Springs weekend earlier this year,
but travel and time difficulties pro-
hibited them from doing so. When
they finally arrived, they asked to
come back when they saw the recep-
tion for Jerry Butler and were over-
joyed when they signed their finals
contract.

Joining the Magnificent Men will
be the world famous Platters who
have accumulated 13 gold records and
3 gold albums since 1956. They will
feature such songs as “Smoke Gets
in Your Eyes,” “The Great Pre-
tender,” “The Magic Touch,” and
“With This Ring.”

Before arriving at WAL, they will
have just completed a three-week
stretch at the Club Atlantis in the
Regency Hyatt House in Atlanta.
They present comedy and dancing be-
sides their fantastic singing, being one
of the most versatile groups in en-
tertainment.

On Tuesday, June 3, a cocktail
party will be held in Red Square
from 3:00 p.m. until 6:00 p.m. The

 

 

Tempests will provide the background
music for the party. Later that even-
ing, from 8:00 to 10:00, the Platters
and the Mag Men will entertain in
Doremus Gymnasium; tickets will be
available at the Co-op. Following the
concert, there will be another combo
party, this one at the Pavilion, with
the Marlboros playing.

Wednesday, June 4, will feature
another pair of events, beginning
with the In-Men singing at a party
in Red Square, from 2:00 until 6:00.
This will be followed later in the
evening with the Kallabash Corpora-
tion playing at a combo party at the
Pavilion, starting at 8:00. The events
of both days are being sponsored

jointly by the Dance Board, the
Senior Class and the IFC.
Law elections held;
Perow to be President,
Reed Vice-president

The Law School capped off its

political year with the selection of
its remaining organizational officers
last week. Editors of the W&l
Lawyer were chosen and a student
body election determined the new
officers of the Student Bar Associa-
tion as the Law School cleared its
agenda in anticipation of exams.

A meeting on May 10 saw Mosby
Perrow elected President of the SBA
for next year. Other officers elected
to assist him are Beverly Reed as
Vice-President, Frank Selbe as Sec-
retary, and Jerry Roehl as Treasurer.
The Student Bar Association is the
main governing body of the Law
School. The new officers will assume
their offices in September for the
duration of the Fall Semester, 1969.

Frank Selbe will also serve with
Charles Bishop as co-editor of the

W&L Lawyer. The publication is
issued semi-annually. The news edi-
tion covers events occuring in the

School and appears in the Spring.
The placement edition is published in
the Fall and goes to some five hun-
dred selected law firms and pre-law
advisors at all accredited colleges and
universities. In addition, the W&L
Lawyer is sent to all WAL Law
School alumni. The circulation of the
Spring news edition is restricted to
alumni,

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Good-bye

In this the best of all possible universities we have for
three years worked on something less than the best of all
possible newspapers. We have gotten excited when others saw
little reason for getting excited, we have eaten hamburgers
from the Co-op until we imagined there was no other lunch

on Tuesday morning, and we

have cut far too many classes

for no other reason than to watch four pieces of metal, size
12 x 18, fill up with lead type and wood blocks. And we loved

every minute of it.

For us, creation was the name of the game. We found in
The Ring-tum Phi something we intensely enjoyed, and our
life was intensely steeped in the serio-comics of this glorious

rag with the absurd name.

Every Editor finds it his right, if not his duty, to put into
words his thoughts, his emotions, and perhaps too much of
himself. We have proved no exception to this; in return it
has tendered one of those all too rare and deeply satisfying
personal experiences we now leave with no small degree of
sadness. And now we’re through.

Or almost through. It would be unfair to leave without
expressing some words of appreciation to the many who have
made our task a bit easier and a good deal more pleasant;
but it would be equally impossible to do so in any complete

way

So we choose to publicly and indelibly say thanks to the

two men who have labored as much as we have this year,
Reeve Kelsey and Reed Byrum, without whose thoughts and
words and cajolery and support and most of all, friendship,
this paper would have been much, much less than what it was.

 

From Vietman and mom
and to Bolivia with love

By JACK HOROWITZ

Michael Thomas is finishing his
second year of teaching at Washing-
ton and Lee. Sociology is the title on
his degree. Social problems is the
title of one of his courses. It meets
at 11:00 a.m., Monday, Wednesday
this week, Tuesday, Thursday last.

Sociology is about people. Some
study books to learn about people.
That's OK but not the only way. Mr.
Thomas knows that this is so. So
he tries to do more.

A social problem today is campus
unrest. The New York Times and the
Village Voice both have cures for
the trouble. But once the blood spat-
ters on the pavement it never comes
all the way clean. If you can’t stop
trouble before the blood flows, the
pressure pile of conflict grows and
the world becomes more and more
insane. Mr. Thomas knows that this
is so. So he tries to do more than
just read about people in books. He
tries to do something about the prob-
lem.

People in books equal history. And
if history can't be used to understand

 

YR’s sponsoring
drive for food
to benefit Biafra

Over the weekend the Slater Cater-
ing Service contributed $200 to the
WAL Food for Nigeria/Biafra. This
large contribution came as a surprise
and almost doubled the amount of
money pledged to date. Mr. Darrell,
who runs Evans Dining Hall, will pre-
sent the check later this week,

Today and tomorrow, the collection
will consist of marked cans placed
around the campus. On Thursday,
the day of fasting, the WAL fra-
ternities are asked to close their
kitchens and contribute the cost of
food for one day to the fund-raising
drive.

If the fraternities want to partici-
pate but do not want to close their
kitchen, they are asked to approve
a small assessment and contribute
this,

Any campus organization that
wishes to help either by contributing
money or by promoting the fund-
raising effort is urged to do so,

The money, once collected, will be
sent to the U.S. Committee for
UNICEF. UNICEF, which has pro-
vided over 40 per cent of the aid
that Nigeria and Biafra have received
is only concerned with feeding and
caring for the women and children
of the two countries. It does not take
a political stand and is not prolong-
ing the war effort.

About 40 people attended the two
showings of the film “A Matter of
Life and Death” shown in Reid Hall
yesterday, which officially began the
fund-raising effort.

The film was a short documentary
analyzing the conditions in Biafra and
Nigeria.

So far, five fraternity houses have
agreed to close their kitchens and
donate the cost of the food to the
drive. The houses are Beta, ZBT,
KA, PEP, and Sigma Nu.

The drive is being sponsored by the
WAL Young Republican Club. It was
initiated when the club was approach-
ed by President Huniley.

something about now then it’s not
worth a whole lot. Sometimes mak-
ing history worth something is called
relevance in education. But what it
really is can be called education com-
ing alive. Mr. Thomas knows. this
too.

Yesterday morning at Il am.
when Michael Thomas walked into
New Science 201 to meet his “Social
Problems” class he was accompanied
by three visitors. President Huntley,
Dean Atwood, and | had been in-
vited to talk about questions of stu-
dent activism on campus. So the sides
were chosen and the class began.

Speaking first with arguments that
had been growing in my head since
Berkley in 1964 I found an occasional
nod of agreement from the other
team. President Huntley followed me,
then Dean Atwood, then more from
each of us. Violence, Vietnam, Mom,
and Apple Pie were mentioned. A
community of ideas was called for,
closed faculty meetings were denounc-
ed as inconsistant with free exchange
of ideas, radicals were labeled both
psychological misfiets and the best of
American youth. All this was tossed
about and more. Surprisingly new
sides were frequently chosen. During
the fifty minute class American flags
on car windows and coats with ties
stopped meaning which side one was
on.

Questions came from the floor.
“Gross” Johnson and “hippie-radical”
Horowitz even agreed at one point.
And then the bell. If there was a
final decision then the referee's and
the ring judges’ card read—If things
can't be worked out at WAL then
maybe they can't be worked out any-
where.

As we left the New Science Build-
ing | spoke with President Huntley:
“Please call me Jack,” | said, “and
I think workable communication ar-
rangements are the answer.” Then
Dean Atwood promised to read the
Village Voice | gave him along
with his New York Times and Wall
Street Journal.

I'm going to Bolivia next year with
the Peace Corps, But Washington and
Lee and Huniley and Atwood remain.
There will be new Freshmen and new
faculty joining this year's faces, I
hope they remember that if it can't
be worked out at WAL then maybe
no one can make it anywhere.

 

P-vant credits
EC colleagues

wit successes

By JAY PASSAVANT
Student Body President

Upon receiving the two awards last
Wednesday evening, | couldn't help
but feel as though I were accepting
them on behalf of the 1968-69 Ex-
ecutive Committee. Although I was
deeply grateful for the awards per-
sonally, there can be little question
tha the recognition that they bring
should go to the E.C. as a whole,
and not just One student,

I wish to express my sincere ap-
preciation for the awards I received,
but more importantly, I would ask
the Student Body laud not one per-
son, but twelve, not the individual,
but the group. The student body of
Washington and Lee can certainly be
proud of the efforts put forth by
these dedicated students during the
past school year as each member,
without exception, has given freely
of his time and energy. You may
rest assured that even if the E.C, had
no legislative meetings whatsoever, the
time given by these men to honor
cases alone would be extremely
burdensome. Yet the members of this
E.C, have achieved much in the
legislative realm and have accrued to
themselves an admirable record. A
summary of achievements is not really
necessary as those students who are
interested in the University know that
the E.C. has been active in many
areas.

Though I wish to refrain from
commending each individual, | must
express sincere thanks for the superior
contribution of Staman Ogilvie and
Joe Tompkins. These two men
characterize the spirit of dedication
and co-operation evident in all mem-
bers of the Executive Committee.

In addition, I would like to applaud
Danny Leonard and Pete Hendricks
for their invaluable assistance in the
administration of the honor system.
Danny and Pete provided leadership
during investigations and honor trials
when it was needed the most. Due to
the confidential nature of the honor
system, these contributions were not
readily apparent to the student body.
These men, as did all other members
of the Committee, dedicated their
efforts to the maintenance of our
cherished tradition.

It is with intense pride that I view
the achievements of these eleven men
over the past year and I am certain
that the four men re-elected to the
Committee for next year will con-
tinue to serve Washington and Lee
with great distinction.

Beware the jabberwock, kid

By JEFFREY WEXLER
Columnist

I read my New York Times on
Sunday. I basked awhile in the hesi-
tant sun and read a book. We all
exist. As Santayana wrote, “There is
no cure for birth and death save to
enjoy the interval.” With certain pre-
sumption, I might add, “enjoy the
interval as men, not marionettes to
times or events or institutions.” These
are the puppets, not we.

“Bugs” Baer died, I read in Sun-
day’s Times. He was 83. You prob-
ably have never heard of him. He
was a columnist a bit better than this
correspondent. But he reached full-
flower in an era golden . . . and,
like Mr. Baer, lamentably dead. The
past, mes vieux, is done. It won't
be here reviled today, And, childer,
prognostications of the future won't
add anything more to what you know
of it than what | know of it. Which,
in the last analysis, is nothing.

 

So, here I reflect both on a rising
spectre in this great national Nation
and on a dying phenomenon in the
Republic. The spectre is Media: the
Fourth Estate. Like one of those
ancient four horsemen it spreads a
disease in epidemic proportions:
Cupidity, the lust for affluence. Radix
malorum est cupiditas. This dying
phenomenon grows weaker as the
passion of man for lucre grows
greater. The phenomenon is civility,
Into its wake has come a latter-day
replacement: impersonality. We are
friendly to those who can help us.
Now, at this point, one might say,
this is the way it has been since Christ
and before. Yes, but not in these
epic proportions, | might add. Men
no longer seek each other's company.
The instant rich (just add Scotch and
ice) are instant rich because they're
all like Sammy. And you know what
made him run: cupidity. “Money,”
as Ayn Rand shrugged, “is the root of
all good.”

 

Of catechisms

DAVE HIGGINS
Columnist

Despite the implications of a grad-
ing system to the contrary, the best
educated are not necessarily the most
knowledgeable. In today’s process of
mass education the genius is un-
fortunately the memory bank, a per-
son who succeeds not because he is
educated but because he beats the
educational system. A true genius is
an adapter who succeeds because of
his ability to comprehend not his
ability to recall what others compre-
hend and wrote for him to study. The
memory bank by the very nature of
his approach is a man of limited
abiliity; he will succeed in the system
but will be limited to contributing to
the system alone, a fact which makes
his education appear circular rather
than linear,

A linear education would imply
that a man never returns to a previ-
ous point in his development. This is
to say that his education develops the
skills of learning and allows him to
apply them in never-ending situations.
The memory bank who learns the
products of the system without com-
prehending the system itself must re-
turn to the system if he is to be
productive.

Since there are very few geniuses

 

in the world, it does not really matter
that the educational process is geared

That was the year, ete.

This might come as a great shock
to my many millions of faithful read-
ers, but this will be my last column
of the year, mainly because this is
the year's last Tuesday edition of the
Ring-tum Phi. But do not be too
despondent, dear reader, Young Mr.
Yevich has begged me to continue
writing the column next year,

Much has happened at WAL dur-
ing my semester of writing “From the
J-School.” (Maybe | should say much
has happened despite my writing
“From the J-School,”)

Probably never before has one
semester seen so much constructive
change at this dowdy old institution
of higher learning.

To begin with, this the first se-
mester of the Say Week. Unfor-
tunately it might be the last. The
absence rate at 8 a.m. classes and
at Friday classes has been high
enough to cause a number of faculty
members to change their minds about
the merits of 5-Day Week. Hope-
fully, the students will not abuse the
privilege next fall, The students are
almost unanimous in support of the

5-Day Week, according to a recent
Ring-tum Phi poll, and it would be
a shame to lose it.

During the semester, the faculty
passed a 12-12-6 calendar, a liberali-
zation of dormitory regulations, and
a lessening of distribution require-
ments, All are worthwhile changes.

The 12-12-6 calendar will give the
serious student the chance to do some
constructive independent study. The
other two changes are long overdue
necessities for a modern university.

Presently, committees of students
and faculty are investigating the feasi-
bility of an expanded enrollment and
coeducation, The betting seems to be
that coeducation will be a reality
by Sept., 1970.

This has also been a good semester
for WAL athletics. An outstanding
performance by all four teams at the
College Athletic Conference Spring
Sports Festival enabled WAL to
maintain possession of the CAC Bell,
symbol of overall conference athletic
supremacy. The tennis team won its
third straight conference crown, the
golf team enjoyed another winning
season, the baseball team chalked up
its greatest number of victories since

1952, and the track team had its
best finish ever in the conference
meet.

I still have some complaints about
life at WAL. I think President Hunt-
ley should have asked for applications
before naming students to the co-
education and size committees, But
an overall view of the University at
the end of this semester is much
better than it was at the start of the
semester.

using such a process, the majority of

Many people would abolish the

student should be a product of the sys-
tem so that he can contribute to the
system on which so much of modern
life is based. The man of unusual
ability, however, should recognize that
grades are “the name of the game” and
should, if he has sufficient motivation,
supercede the system by not being
satisfield with grades alone. He will
have to succeed despite the system or
in addition to the system. But he
will find himself educated in the true
sense of the word.

This motivation must come from
outside the usual academic system and
may result in much skeptical com-
ment. But if a man wishes to de-
velop to his fullest, he must be
mislead by the system. Systematized
knowledge is not the goal but a means.
His education should exceed the
limited goal of knowledgeability. His
education should be the development
of a talented insight not the accumla-
tion of patented answering.

It is very difficult to succed despite
the norm; however this seems to be
the only alternative in an environment
geared to the average. But then isn't
it the mark of a genius that he is
not average? Perhaps a system will
ultimately force exceptions to the
rule to arise more and more frequ-
ently. If such occurs then the educa-
tional system will have succeded de-
spite itself. But until then students
should not be misled by the logical
but inconclusive implications of a
system.

Letters
To he Editor

Small questions
propriety
Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

I would like to question the propri-
ety of the current Biafran food drive
being handled by the WAL YR’.
According to my sources, the drive
was initiated by a letter from Senator
Edward Kennedy to President Robert
Huntley concerning participation in
such a drive, President Huniley for-
warding the letter to the YR's for
consideration.

Doesn't this seem rather odd? The
YR's are a political not a charitable,
organization; they exist primarily as
a means of getting college-age indi-
viduals involved in the Republican
Party. Furthermore, it is even more
curious when it is remembered that
this drive is sponsored by the United
Nations, and the national YR organi-
zation has repeatedly been rather
opposed to the UN

Wouldn't it make more sense to
have forwarded the letter to one of
the several campus charitable organi-
zations, or to the Political Science
Club, which, at least, has more UN
contacts than the YR's? And what
of the Young Democrats, the party
of the man who involved us in this
in the first place?

There is something lacking in the
decision to have the YR's sponsor
such a drive. It just doesn't make
serine

 

So we seek the silver, not the
bread nor the wine, Eat, drink, and
be merry . . tomorrow. Today,
we're too busy being successful. So
our colleagues become handholds on
the ladder. Once used, they are
dropped for another buddy. I need
not, I trust, cite examples, my dear
friends . . . Without fellow-travellers,
with only competitors, where can our
brave new man find peace? What are
the pitstops on the road, the ladder,
the treadmill to success? Media!!!
Cinematographic stereophonic W.W.
W.W.—A.M. and F.M.! Magazines!
Newspapers, records, and the idiot
box!! MEDIA! We are seduced by
colors and sounds and layout and
foldout. Covered with millions of tons
of newsprint and celluloid film and
recorded tape and plastic platters, we
are invincible from one another, de-
fended by our seductress, and we are
alone...

BABY, THAT’S WHERE IT’S AT,

Media!!! Tom Wolfe knows it. But
he’s a card carrrying member of it.
He, they, me(?) have got you. You're
trapped. You've tuned in, turned on,
dropped out. You don’t listen to the
people around you. They're not in
stereo. Love comes last. How can any
girl compare to fifteen square feet of
Candy's left breast? In technicolor!!
Good grief, Daddy, people are unreal.
Media is the new reality.

So the Fourth Estate assumes the
prerogatives of the first three and
dictates all values, all desires, aspira-
tions, standards, and it dreams for
us too. Madison Avenue and the fol-
lowers of Cecil B, deMille and the
Grove Press and the grey eminences
behing the N.B.C. peacock have teem-
ed up to create a system of domina-
tion of minds and mores more insidi-
ous than anything those old bogey-
men of the Military-Industrial Com-
plex could ever nightmare up. All
them generals and button-pushers and
contractors want to do is destroy the
world. Clean. Simple. Bang. Why go
with a whimper in a million million
years when you can go out now—
in style?

Media won't kill us. It maims. The
gospel of the great god. Media is
Mediocrity. Believe me, check your
Funk and Wagnells, boobtubers, they
come from the same Latin root. The
middle class minds of the Fourth
Estate are leading us to a temporal
salvation, a neuter utopia that runs
on AC and DC and runs nowhere.
Excellence is heresy to Media. So
we get adequacy. No more wit. Only
half-wits. Media, Latin for half. A
paradise, we are seduced to, a Para-
dise so mediocre, we'll sleep through
Armageddon, whimpering . . . Give
me the Military-Industrial Complex.
rll go as I live, with thunder and
flame. Only when man ceases mock-
ing himself does he become a mock-
ery. Look around you. No one’s
laughing.

out that

only three of the present

expectation which had not been ful-

the issue be treated this year. After

several more statements which ex-
pressed general dissatisfaction with
the organizations competence and a

fear that the organization was drifting

called for. The resolution to withdraw

one abstention.

The EC then adjourned for the

(Continued from Page 1)

In questioning Dean John about
the many changes that have come
about during the past year this writer
found that he is definitely to be
counted in with the progessive side of
the faculty.

Though Dean John voted for the
12-12-6 system he has no real prefer-
ence for when the short term is held.
He does however, support the short
term in itself and sees great pos-
sibilities in it. Though he admitted
the possibility of abuse of the short
term he expressed a great faith in
the maturity of the W&L student
body and said that he was essentially
optimistic about the success of the
plan. He also said hat the success
would also depend on the instructors
and what they will demand of their
students.

In respect to the liberalized cur-
will be beneficial and attractive
students from both ends of the intel-
lectual spectrum. He feels that
extremely gifted students will be able
to go right into fields in which they
are interested while the less gifted
will not be so highly pressured by |
the rigid freshman requirements |

About the possibility of W&L|
going Co-ed, Dean John simply stat- |
ed that he had not made up his mind
on this issue. However, he did admit
that at this time he would be in- |
clined to vote for the move to go)
Co-ed. He that he was on the |
committee for the study of the ques-
tion and felt that a great deal of |
study must be done before the matter |
can be decided,

said

Dean John mentioned several times
in Our conversation the excellent com-
munication between the students of
WA&L and the administration and
faculty. He forsees the continuation |
of the ability of students to voice their
desires through proper channels and

the willingness of the faculty to listen

and move to enact constructive
changes.
The many physical changes o¢-

curing on campus are seen by Dean
John great boost to the Uni-
versity and is optimistic of far-reach-
ing beneficial results of the physical
improvement of the school.

He added that he would like to see

would become a more truly resi-
dential school.

Dean John sees the new parietal
rules as a logical extension of the
ever-increasing student  self-govern-
ment and is Optimistic that the new
rules will be beneficial and will not
be abused. He again stressed his

In concluding our conversation,
the new Dean of Students emphasized
an aspect of our generation which he
admires and feels is an encouraging
sign. He lauded the interest of so
many students in the affairs of the
day: Viet Nam, poverty, social prob-
lems, University modernization and
other similar important aspects of our
life today. He compared our genera-
tion’s activity and desire to be heard
with his generation, calling his the
“silent generation.” Although he is

still could easily fit into the silent
generation he still sees hope in the
increased interest and participation in
life by students today,

16 appointments
made to faculty
for coming year

Twelve appointments to the faculty
of the College of Washington and
Lee University were recently announc-
ed by Dean William W. Pusey, III.

The appointments, which will be
effective September 1. are for the
rank of instructor; however, Dean
Pusey said that five of the instructors
who are working toward completion
of their doctoral degrees will be eli-
gible for appointment as assistant pro-
fessors if they complete their Ph.D.
requirements by September.

Two appointments of _ political
science instructors were also announc-
ed in the School of Commerce by
Dean Lewis W. Adams. They are:

bachelor’s degree from Princeton and
the master’s from Duke and is cur-
rently working toward a Ph.D. at
Duke, and Wayne G. Reilly, who is
currently completing Ph.D. require-
ments at the University of Pittsburgh.
Reilly earned the bachelor’s degree
at Middlebury College and the mast-
er’s at Trinity College.

One new instructor in Fine Arts
will also serve as artist-in-residence
for 1969-70. He is I-Hsiung Ju, a
native of China, who taught for 20
years in schools and colleges in the
Philippines and received his Bachelor
of Fine Arts and Masters of Arts
in History degrees from the University
of St. Thomas in Manila.

Other new instructors in the college
and their teaching fields will be:

Each generation, shaped by forces outside and within it, asks the question

“How?” Other generations, needing
“What?”

Your generation has asked “Why?”

As Americans we must together ask

why we pursue certain goals instead

A college education in the humanities and sciences teaches us that the real
power to deal with these problems comes out of the human mind and the
human heart. All power must be disciplined by trained intelligence and

tempered by compassion.

Each of you is a center of power. Your professional or social or religious
or political activity will determine the shape of the future of your nation

and of the world.

The question asked by your generation—-Why?—is one that must be answered

degrees today at Washington and Lee
University’s 220th commencement.

The university administrator was

ment and Dean of the Graduate
School of Arts and Sciences at the
University of Virginia. He was con-
ferred the Doctor of Science degree.

ated in 1947 from Randolph-Macon
where he was elected to Phi Beta

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion Of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper

Graduation Day—1969

 

 

 

To the entering freshmen

You, as soon-to-be freshmen at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, are entering upon a new way of life. The next four
years could possibly be four of the happiest and most pro-
ductive years in your life. The challenge to make these four
years your best confronts each of you personally. What you
do here will depend on you alone. What you get out of W&L
will depend on you alone. The opportunity is provided; the
responsibility is yours.

You are entering your college life in a time of great soul-
searching on college campuses across the nation. Faculty and
students alike are re-examining their values. As freshmen at
W&L, the responsibility is yours to participate in this process.
Deliberative self-evaluation and self-criticism yield growth and
maturity. Washington and Lee grows constantly—but growth
here comes rationally, not haphazardly—and as the University
grows and matures, the students who are the University, grow
and mature.

If you shirk your responsibility to your school, if you
don’t participate in the self-evaluation process, you will betray
not only your school, you will betray yourselves. As freshmen
here, you can be a part of the changes and traditions that are
Washington and Lee University.

This year a record number of changes were initiated which
will be in their infancy next year. The responsibility is yours
to carry them into adulthood. The responsibility is yours to
get the most benefit from them. Get involved! The greatest
feature of Washington and Lee is the opportunity for all its
students to join in the whole life of the University community.
Here, your professors will be far more than willing to listen to
you, to evaluate what you say, and to change—when change
is needed. Here, you will be able to know your professors al-
most as well as you know your best friend. Here, you will be
able to know the first name of most of your fellow students.
Here, at Washington and Lee if you accept your responsibility,
you will find that smallness in size makes possible the develop-
ment of an intangible feeling of companionship unavailable
anywhere else. This companionship—student to student, stu-
dent to professor—makes Washington and Lee the outstand- |
ing University it is.

Without your help though, we can go no further. You will
be the first freshmen to enjoy for a full year the privileges
of a five-day class week; the liberalized dormitory rules; the
new student center. More changes are in store: a 12-12-6 tri-
mester will probably go into effect your sophomore year; con-
struction on a practially new gymnasium, twice the size of the
one now, will begin this summer; co-education may be a fact
before you graduate. Make the most of your opportunity.

You have a busy but wonderful four years ahead, and
your responsibility is tremendous—for the next four years you
are Washington and Lee. Study and participate. Accept change
but keep alive the traditions that have made Washington
and Lee great. You will leave after four years a Washington
and Lee man and with a teardrop in your eye be forever grate-

ful for it. —R.H.Y.

erty are “where it’s at,” Washington |
and Lee University’s students have
been apathetically “out of it” this
year.
To the contrary, the 1968-69 aca-
demic year was marked by what
many observers believe was a high
degree of student and faculty activism
at Washington and Lee, a private
liberal arts institution where tradition
has often been more noteworthy than |
upheaval.

The activism came NOT in storm-
ing walls but in implementing aca-
demic and social changes that ma-
jorities of both the faculty and student
body desired at WAL.

“The average student at Washing-
ton and Lee can see that things are
changing and are changing for his
benefit,” commented Jay Passavant,
this year’s student government presi-
dent. “This fact takes away much of
the initiative for protest.”

Within the past year, the faculty
has approved, following student en-

From the new EC president

 

To the class of ’73

By SWEDE HENBERG
Student Body President

Recently I have heard several
upperclassmen remark that they wish
they were entering Washington and
Lee as a freshman this fall. Of course
these students are only half-serious,
but their comments indicate an at-
mosphere of increased confidence in
the future of the university. Beyond
any doubt, the options open to the
class of 1973 will far exceed those
Open to any previous class in the
school’s history.

New curriculum changes will make
possible a wider range of academic
involvement during the freshman
year, Later, when next fall’s fresh-
men become upperclassmen, the pos-
sibility of independent study in any
number of areas will be open to
them. Next year’s freshman will—also
for the first time—have the privilege
of female visitation in the dormitories
on weekends. These two very im-
portant changes combine to expand
the freedom and responsibility of
Washington and Lee students.

Quite probably, however, the great-
est advantage of the new measures
adopted this spring is that they in-
crease the self-governing aspect of
student life. A liberal education is not
something forced upon students; they
must themselves question and let that
be motivation for inquiry. Thus, from
now on, a freshman will have to
rely upon his own capacity for choos-
ing to get as broad a perspective as
possible. Exposure to certain realms
of knowledge will no langer be man-
datory. This fact might be harmful
in a few instances where students
choose to limit themselves, but I
think the added freedom will pro-
vide advantages that far surpass any
disadvantages.

Regulation of the new dormitory
provisions will, as with everything
else concerning student life, be en-
tirely student- controlled. Again re-
sponsibility increases along with the
additional freedom. Yet prospective
freshman should not get the impres-
sion that this is a mere experiment to
see how well the students respond

these changes
formulated, one theme remained con-
stant throughout—that of absolute

their own affairs.

In recent years the whole concept
of assimilation into Washington and
Lee has changed. Fewer and fewer
rules and regulations have been im-
posed, as is evidenced by the two
recent changes I have just discussed,
The whole emphasis has been on
flexibility—with the realization that
strict regulations often invite students
to flaunt them. The Honor System
itself has been modified so that it
better serves the Student Body. Add-
ed flexibility in defending the rights
of the accused should not be in-
terpreted as a weakening of the Honor
System. I think it can be now said
that the new stipulations make it nec-
essary for the Executive Committee to
regard all students (including defend-
ants) equally until an accusation is
proved,

Thus I would encourage entering
freshmen to first familiarize them-
selves with all summer mailings—
particularly because several of them
will contain information on_ the
changes for next year. Once on
campus the freshman should be aware
that all decisions are his. Personally
I think choosing whether or not to
join a fraternity will slowly become
as large a question as what fraternity
to join has been in the past. This
too is good, because it further en-
larges a freshman’s breadth of choice.

1 can only urge, then, that the
freshman hold himself open to the
different alternatives presented. When
deciding on extra-curricular activities,
a student should remember that any
decisions he makes at the beginning
of the year is not binding. Possibili-
ties remain open for all four years
at Washington and Lee. In reality
the most often imposed limitation at
WAL is not external; it is not through
rules and through the boundaries of
already established organizations that
a student finds himself frustrated. No,
much more common than this is self-
limitation, and that proves eventually
the most frustrating boundary of all.

A Message to the New Students

The traditions of Washington and Lee University require conven-
tional dress. Our shop, in keeping with these traditions, is designed
solely for the W&L man and features the natural
shoulder style prevailing on our campus.

The correct appearance of both “on and off” campus is so very im-
portant throughout the school year . . .

AND YOU CERTAINLY WANT TO LOOK YOUR BEST
DURING RUSH WEEK.

Our long experience with W&L men enables us to soundly advise
and fill all your complete clothing requirements in the beginning
and throughout the school year.

You, as a student of W&L, hold the privilege of an open charge ac-

count, either billed direct to you or to your home, or both, whatever

the case may be. We hope you will make use of this and our many
other services.

We cordially invite your correspondence on particular apparel prob-
lems that you may have. You may be assured of our personal and
prompt attention to each and every inquiry made.

Coeducation--aid or hindrance?
Opinions pro and con expressed

Would coeducation make dating
more “natural” and enhance the edu-
cational climate? Or would it lower
the quality and alter the traditional
objectives of all-male or all-female
liberal arts colleges?

Arguments were voiced on both
sides of the issue at Washington and
Lee University recently, as the debate
over the possible institution of co-
education at all-male W&L warmed
up a bit.

A forum sponsored by Lambda
Chi Alpha fraternity elicited many
Opinions, but, most persons admitted,
brought few substantial facts into the
Open on coeducation, Dr. Louis W.
Hodges, W&L professor of religion
and chairman of a university commit-
tee studying coeducation, moderated
the panel.

Professor Eleanor Barton, chair-
man of the fine arts department at
Sweet Briar College, argued for the
preservation of some single-sex col-
leges.

“Since probably 95 per cent (of
colleges) will be coeducational, I do
advocate most strongly keeping a few
institutions alive for those persons
who can best be trained for a highly
complex society in this kind of single
institution,” she said,

She said a “bit of a bandwagon”
effect has begun in higher education
in which “you are regarded as a re-
actionary unless you advocate co-
education. I like to think that maybe
time is on our side, and that within
3 to 5 years our kind of institution,
instead of seeming reactionary, will
be regarded as widely experimental
and novel,”

The first result of coeducation at
Vassar, she added, was that the
woman director of admissions, who
had served for many years, was re-
placed by a man. The next step in
a formerly woman's college could be
fewer places for women faculty mem-

-|bers and women students, she con-
‘|tended. “I'm desperately afraid that

in a very short time 75 to 100 years
of progress in women’s education
would be very quickly wiped out.”
Dr. Delos Hughes, associate profes-
sor of political science at W&L, said
it's not a question of whether _ the
continuation of education at W&L
depends on going coed. “The real
question is whether education at W&L
will be beiter if it is coeducational
than it will be if it is not coeduca-
tional.”
He the absence of

women from the W&L campus as
an “integral part of this community”
is “a positive distraction from good
education at Washington and Lee and
that the presence of women just as
a part-time part of the community
only serves to aggravate the situation
rather than easing the distraction
which their absence represents.”

The W&L student must go to “such
extraordinary lengths in terms of the
time, energy and ingenuity he must
exert in order to have a satisfactory
social life that it becomes a pre-
occupation, sometimes even an obses-
sion with him.”

Bruce E, Downing, a W&L senior
from New York, reinforced Dr.
Hughes’ point of view, noting the
existence at W&L of a so-called “stud
image”—the image of the student who
makes the trip to a woman's college
in mid-week and has a date, “as if
this is something unnatural.”

At co-ed colleges, dates of a half-
hour or hour, and “study dates” are
common, but at W&L because of the
distance which must be traveled to
girls’ schools, dates last for extended
periods and studying is “a very rare
thing,” Downing said.

James C. Hamill Jr., a W&L senior
from Oklahoma City, argued that to
initiate coeducation at W&L would
require “a fundamental redefinition
of what this university is.” He said
WAL has specialized in pregraduate
education of persons for fields of law,

U.S. Army Medical Corps, Dr. Smith
went to Korea twice with a surgical
research team. He was also instru-
mental in introducing use of the
artificial kidney machine into military

voted, only 53 opposed the basic cur-
riculum change proposal.

Student government endorsed the
proposal for the five-day week which
was eventually adopted by the faculty.
And students serve as voting members
of the University’s Student Affairs
Committee, which produced _ the
dormitory self-government plan that
was accepted by the faculty.

“When a student feels a need for
change, or he has a gripe, he can
take it either to student government
or to the university administration,
right on up to the president,” Passa-
vant said. “The factor of communica-
tion is a definite asset at Washington
and Lee.”

portunity Grants under the Higher
Education Act of 1965, and the Na-
tional Defense Student Loans under
1958 legislation. In addition, an ex-
tensive program of privately-endowed
scholarship aid is continuing.

ment of religion last September. A

Coeducation at W&L?
(Continued from page 5)

business, medicine and academic fields
in which men “have traditionally
dominated.”

Co-education would require a de-
emphasis of W&L’s traditional pro-
grams such as commerce and science,
and vast expansion of fields such as
education and art in which women
have dominated, Hamill argued.
Furthermore, there is no guarantee
that the women who would apply to

 

| W&L would have academic standards
/as high as the male students, he said.
The faculty-student study commit-

| tee headed by Dr. Hodges is attempt-

‘ing to gather objective data on the
‘subject of coeducation and is schedul-
ed to make a report by the end of
1969. WAL, an institution of 1,400
men, will make its decision on co-
education,
